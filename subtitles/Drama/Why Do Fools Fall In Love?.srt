<i>I'm back.</i>

3
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,410
<i>Are you really Xiao Lu?</i>

4
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,110
This time, I've come back for Tao Zi.

5
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,150
I'll always treat you as a sister.

6
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,250
You're not my brother.

7
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,820
<i>I really like you.</i>

8
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,290
<i>Do you know how much I love you?</i>

9
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:58,930
<i>So Lu Tian Xing tore up the
 proposal that I gave you?</i>

10
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,530
He really did suddenly turn up.

11
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,770
Everyone, here come your snacks.

12
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,230
- Your noodle.
 - My noodle!

13
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,200
I'm first!

14
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,380
You deserve it for wearing heels.

15
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,240
Hello, everybody!

16
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,710
Uncle Fu?

17
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,580
What are you doing in our office?

18
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:26,290
I'm delivering the amended proposal
 on behalf of Tian Ji's CEO.

19
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,390
Amended...

20
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:31,460
I thought we just signed one with
 Wang Ting Wei and Helen...

21
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:35,500
That proposal is no longer effective.

22
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,930
So this is the one that will replace it.

23
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,070
Here.

24
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,300
CEO Lu has listed out four companies

25
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,040
which he thinks are suitable for OZ.

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,140
You can start your pre-production now.

27
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,050
You mean we'll be doing four projects
 at the same time?

28
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,380
This is great, Boss!

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,090
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:02,960
If our internal problems have caused you
 any inconvenience

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,790
I'd like to apologize to you
 on behalf of Tian Ji.

32
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,060
That's okay.

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,530
It's common to encounter problems since
 we just started working together.

34
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,270
That means there really were problems with
 the previous two companies.

35
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,970
Lucky you told us in time.

36
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,710
Otherwise if a small company like us gets
 involved with such companies

37
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:24,340
then we'll lose the good reputation that we
 worked so hard for.

38
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,350
That's right.

39
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,350
Don't worry, it won't happen again.

40
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,150
Allow me to tell you about the
 backgrounds of these four companies.

41
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,620
Which one should I start with?

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,530
The food and beverage company, or the
 one that sells skincare products?

43
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:42,530
It's up to you.

44
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:51,340
That's all for today, let's continue tomorrow.

45
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,210
Boss.

46
00:03:53,210 --> 00:03:55,380
Since we've got four projects on our hands

47
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,710
don't you think we should have a celebration?

48
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,110
Good idea.

49
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,250
You haven't had dinner
 at my place for a while.

50
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,280
Why don't you all come over to my place?

51
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,490
I better go back now.

52
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,960
Miss Tao, please send my regards
 to your parents for me.

53
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,160
Uncle Fu, aren't you coming with us as well?

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,430
No, I can't.

55
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:16,760
I have to go home and
 take care of my master.

56
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,330
You guys have fun.

57
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,370
<i>Well done.</i>

58
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,610
Let's go.

59
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,080
Let's go!

60
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,950
Cheers!

61
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,220
There's a ton of food so eat more, okay?

62
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,660
They're all Mama Tao's signature dishes.

63
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,760
You can't go home unless
 you finish everything.

64
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,600
Come on, why are you
 threatening these kids?

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,800
Don't give them so much pressure.

66
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,770
Just ignore him and enjoy the meal.

67
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,870
That's right.

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,710
Let's eat.

69
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,310
Xiao Lu, here.

70
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:06,580
- Thank you, Mama Tao.
 - Good boy, eat more.

71
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,520
You'll need more energy to help Tao Zi
 with the four projects.

72
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,720
But Boss, we need around eight million
 dollars for these projects' bid bond.

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,190
Where would we get this money for Tian Ji?

74
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
Eight million dollars!

75
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,100
You mean you'll have to
 pay eight million dollars

76
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,000
before you actually earn any money?

77
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,540
The reason why the
 bid bond's so expensive

78
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,710
is because we're doing four projects at once.

79
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,650
Then where are you going to get
 so much money from?

80
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,350
Don't worry, Mama Tao.

81
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,750
We'll figure it out.

82
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,450
Tian Ji will refund us the money once we
 finish those projects.

83
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:49,760
Stop kidding me.

84
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,760
How are you young people going to find
 eight million dollars?

85
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:00,170
How about this?

86
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,600
Honey.

87
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:04,970
Let's mortgage this Chinese clinic to
 the bank for a loan.

88
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,470
Once they finish the projects

89
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,940
they'll refund us the bid bond, right?

90
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,110
Dad.

91
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,810
This clinic belongs to you and Mom.

92
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,850
How can I mortgage it to the bank?

93
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,460
Then what are you going to do?

94
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:32,330
I can take care of the eight million dollars.

95
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,070
Xiao Lu, are you feeling okay?

96
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,910
We're talking about eight million dollars.

97
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,810
If you can barely support yourself,
 why would you have so much money?

98
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:49,820
One of my relatives left me with some money

99
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,520
but I never used any of it.

100
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,360
I was going to save it for making
 my own film later.

101
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,060
But it looks like I should use it to help OZ now.

102
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,830
That's your money.

103
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,930
Eight million dollars is a lot of money.

104
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,830
Since you're part of OZ's staff

105
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,100
I really can't take your money and use it
 for the bid bond.

106
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,810
But I think it's the only option now, isn't it?

107
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,880
How about this?

108
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,320
With the other 30 percent that
 Lu Tian Xing already has

109
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,590
we'll give you 30 percent as mortgage.

110
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,090
This way, it won't feel as if we're just
 taking his money, right?

111
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,290
No, that won't do.

112
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,860
I can't take that 30 percent of
 the shares from you.

113
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,870
Just take the money first.

114
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,940
You can just pay me back
 after we get refunded.

115
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,640
Xiao Lu.

116
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,510
What belongs to Tao Zi also belongs to you.

117
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,740
Papa Tao already made such an offer.

118
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,280
Why are you still being so insistent?

119
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,720
Stop drawing such a clear
 line between you two.

120
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,480
Stop kidding us, okay?

121
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,620
So it's decided.

122
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,860
If you don't accept our shares

123
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,330
I'll be insulted.

124
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:09,930
Do you think OZ's not good enough for you?

125
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,930
Or are you going to dump Tao Zi again?

126
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,770
No, that's not it.

127
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,640
Okay, it's a deal.

128
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,610
Come on.

129
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,680
This bamboo sprout's very sweet.

130
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,380
Try it.

131
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,560
[Arrogant Creep - Lu Tian Xing]

132
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,730
Hello?

133
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:43,530
Hello, it's me.

134
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,870
What's up?

135
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,070
Can you...

136
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:51,340
come out for a minute?

137
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,010
There's something that
 I'd like to say to you.

138
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:32,010
So why did you want to see me?

139
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:35,780
I asked you to come out

140
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:40,350
because I want to say goodbye to you.

141
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:43,190
Goodbye?

142
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,990
That's because...

143
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,530
I'll be leaving Taiwan tomorrow.

144
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,800
Leaving Taiwan?

145
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,730
Where are you going?

146
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,500
I want to have a change of environment
 and pursue my dream

147
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,170
and do things that I want to do.

148
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,610
So if all goes well

149
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,310
I don't think I'll be coming back.

150
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,850
So...

151
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:10,350
we're not going to see each other again?

152
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,060
You won't have to see this
 arrogant creep again.

153
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,600
Shouldn't you be happy about it?

154
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,380
Tao Le Si.

155
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,990
I didn't make you
 fall in love with me

156
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,250
but...

157
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,260
we can still be friends, right?

158
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,250
Thank you.

159
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:16,120
We can finally become friends.

160
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,390
Hopefully

161
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,360
you'll always remember

162
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,230
this friend.

163
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,490
Why look so upset?

164
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,330
Even after I'm gone

165
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:02,900
I can still be your target in life.

166
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,530
I know that

167
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:08,770
it's very difficult to surpass me.

168
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,800
So...

169
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,940
you must do your best.

170
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,540
Okay?

171
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,680
Well...

172
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,860
I've got to go now.

173
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,710

00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,510
<i>Starting from this moment</i>

175
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:53,950
<i>Lu Tian Xing's going to disappear</i>

176
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,650
<i>and you'll have Xiao Lu by your side.</i>

177
00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:00,550
<i>The love of these two people</i>

178
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,360
<i>will be my love for you.</i>

179
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:13,570
Get out of the car.

180
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,380
As the boss of your company

181
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:27,150
it's okay for all of your staff to cry

182
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,480
except you.

183
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,120
You can never cry.

184
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,120
Do you know that I like you?

185
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,360
I don't want to know.

186
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,390
You idiot.

187
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:10,290
This is the time when you should cry.

188
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,690
Otherwise how am I supposed
 to comfort you?

189
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
Watch out!

190
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,670
Are you okay?

191
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,100
I'm fine.

192
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,770
Why did you rush over to save me?

193
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:25,640
What if you got hit in the head?

194
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,410
Like I said before

195
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,780
I'll protect you.

196
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,290
Thank you.

197
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:45,760
Lu Tian Xing.

198
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:58,140
Okay, I know.

199
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,070
I'll do my best.

200
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:00,970
I know, tomorrow, okay?

201
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:03,140
There's no use forcing me.

202
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,410
I'm sorry, okay?

203
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,680
Lance.

204
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,150
What's wrong? Where's Huan Huan?

205
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,880
She's in her room.

206
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,750
Lance, can you try talking to her?

207
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,390
Her phone's been off for a whole day.

208
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,320
Everyone's chasing me.

209
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,660
She's supposed to attend an event tomorrow

210
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,730
but she said she wouldn't go.

211
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,000
I really don't know what to do with her.

212
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,830
Okay, don't worry.

213
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,670
Go back first, leave it with me.

214
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,040
- Okay, thanks.
 - Not at all.

215
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,720
Don't come in.

216
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,160
I don't want to see anyone.

217
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,060
Not even me?

218
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:01,170
What's wrong?

219
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:04,740
If you keep your phone off,
 refuse to go to work

220
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,540
and eat ice cream all day

221
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,410
then Leo might think you're too fat for his ad.

222
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,080
Is Brother Tian Xing going to be a producer

223
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,520
for Director Leo's ad?

224
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,750
Since it's a joint project between
 Tian Ji and OZ

225
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,550
of course he'll be the producer.

226
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,930
Trust me.

227
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,670
Whatever it is that you like

228
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:37,470
I'll definitely make it yours for you.

229
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,610
But the ice cream's mine.

230
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,750
<i>Tian Xing.</i>

232
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,830
[Master, I've already deposited eight
 million dollars into OZ's account.]

233
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:12,370
Xiao Lu, here's the shares transfer document.

234
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:14,470
- Take a look.
 - Okay.

235
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm starving, what are we having for lunch?

236
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,650
The BBQ pork place is having specials,
 let's go and try it out.

237
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,950
Okay, Boss?

238
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,680
Leo, Xiao Lu, what do you think?

239
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,920
Okay, I'm good.

240
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,690
I'm having a script meeting
 with Huan Huan later.

241
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:30,720
I want to talk about some problems
 with Xiao Lu first.

242
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,290
You guys go, just bring us takeout
 when you get back.

243
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,890
Okay, let's go Boss.

244
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,300
- Let's go.
 - Bye.

245
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,640
Script?

246
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,800
What's wrong, Leo?

247
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,770
Lu Tian Xing.

248
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:30,620
What is it that you want?

249
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:05,220
When did you find out?

250
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,490
That's not the right question.

251
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:17,560
The right question is, why did you use a false
 identity to get close to Tao Zi and OZ?

252
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,270
What do you want?

253
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,240
Isn't that obvious enough?

254
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,140
I did it because I like her.

255
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,050
It's a pity that it's the other me that she likes.

256
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:39,020
That's why I had no choice but to let
 Xiao Lu appear again

257
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,750
and continue to love her as Xiao Lu.

258
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,920
That's my reason.

259
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,930
You're lying to her.

260
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,860
Do you know how heartbroken she'd be if
 she discovered that Xiao Lu is Lu Tian Xing?

261
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,640
Don't worry.

262
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,640
The moment I decided to appear
 as Xiao Lu again

263
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,240
Lu Tian Xing had already disappeared.

264
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,620
You'll never see Lu Tian Xing again.

265
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:16,990
From now on, the person who'll
 be at Tao Zi's side

266
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,760
will only be Xiao Lu.

267
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,330
But of course

268
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,030
if you want to get rid of your love enemy

269
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,900
then you're welcome to disclose my real
 identity to Tao Le Si.

270
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,710
I don't want to get rid of anybody.

271
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:41,450
I just want Tao Zi to be happy.

272
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:46,250
But no matter who you are...

273
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,460
I'll never let you hurt her.

274
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,130
Whether you're Xiao Lu or Lu Tian Xing

275
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:01,200
you better make sure she keeps smiling

276
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,570
and is happy for the rest of her life.

277
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,910
I never saw you as my competitor before.

278
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:16,110
But now...

279
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:21,120
I don't think I should underestimate your
 feelings for Tao Le Si.

280
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,620
Don't worry.

281
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,690
I won't tell anyone.

282
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,100
Because it'd only make Tao Zi upset.

283
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:12,000
But if you ever try to hurt her...

284
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:15,810
I'll be there to protect her.

285
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,510
At that time

286
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,710
I'll never let you get near her again.

287
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,760
Huan Huan?

288
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,470
I thought she's having a meeting with Leo.

289
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,140
- What's she doing here?
 - Yeah, how strange.

290
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,780
Forget it, let's go back to the office.

291

292
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,310

 OZ and their client.

Please take a look.

294
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,720
Do you know where they
 got the money from?

295
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,890
Jia Gai Xian said it's Xiao Lu's money.

296

Xiao Lu's money?

297
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,860
That's right.

298
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:44,500
OZ mortgaged 30 percent
 of its shares to Xiao Lu.

299
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,430
After they're able to
 pay him back the money

300
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,400
they'll buy back the shares from Xiao Lu.

301
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,440
What a smart plan.

302
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,710

Aren't you?

494
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:13,770
You used Xiao Lu's identity to take away
 30 percent of OZ's shares.

495
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,770
With the other 30 percent
 that Lu Tian Xing already has

496
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:19,810
you're now officially OZ's boss.

497
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:26,380
Isn't that what you had in mind when you came
 to my place for the first time?

498
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,250
Why did you lie to me?

499
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:36,890
Fine.

500
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,030
Perhaps it's not entirely true that I'm Xiao Lu

501
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:44,300
but Tao Le Si

502
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:47,840
my feelings for you are true.

503
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:51,340
Your feelings are true?

504
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,940
That's right.

505
00:44:55,250 --> 00:44:58,620
You used Xiao Lu's identity to make me
 fall in love with you.

506
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:02,390
Then you used Xiao Lu's identity to take
 away OZ's shares.

507
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,220
You've stolen away my brother's company

508
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,990
deceived everyone's trust in you

509
00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:08,760
and deceived my love for Xiao Lu!

510
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,500
That's what's true.

511
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,870
What's this?

512
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,070
A lie.

513
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:24,940
The lie that you've made up.

514
00:45:30,050 --> 00:45:33,420
The sincere and thoughtful Xiao Lu

515
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,990
who always had a bright smile on his face.

516
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:42,330
A mask that was created by someone who
 wanted to satisfy his own desire!

517
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:43,830
Tao Le Si!

518
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:48,770
Whether I'm Xiao Lu or Lu Tian Xing

519
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:56,170
I was absolutely true to you, OZ,
 and everyone else.

520
00:46:17,930 --> 00:46:23,400
I never ever want to see you again.

521
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,690
Tao Le Si!

522
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:44,160
Tao Le Si...

523
00:46:46,790 --> 00:46:48,590
Tao Le Si.

524
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:54,430
I'm warning you to stop following me.

525
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,590
[Huan Huan]

526
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:24,460
<i>Your call is being diverted to voicemail.</i>

527
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,630
<i>Call charges will apply after the beep...</i>

528
00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:06,170
[Huan Huan]

529
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:17,110
Hello?

530
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,350
Tao Le Si, it's Huan Huan.

531
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:21,990
I know.

532
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:29,330
Brother Tian Xing's not answering my call.

533
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,100
I know where he is.

534
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,600
<i>I'll send you the address later.</i>

535
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,810
<i>You can come and take him away.</i>

536
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,140
Okay, thank you.

537
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,800
Our kite's finally flying!

538
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:14,770
Look how high the kite is, Huan Huan.

539
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:17,510
Brother Tian Xing, you're amazing!

540
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:55,780
Brother Tian Xing.

541
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,720
- Tao Le Si!
 - Brother Tian Xing!

542
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:06,390
What are you doing here?

543
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:08,330
Tao Le Si told me you were here.

544
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,600
- Brother Tian...
 - Tao Le Si, listen to me!

545
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:15,230
Brother Tian Xing!

546
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:17,230
Can you tell that she doesn't love you?

547
00:50:17,230 --> 00:50:19,640
Get the hell out of here!

548
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,810
Tao Le Si.

549
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:23,610
Listen to me.

550
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:26,310
Whether I'm Xiao Lu or Lu Tian Xing

551
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:27,710
I still love you with all my heart.

552
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:29,050
Please.

553
00:50:29,050 --> 00:50:32,220
Trust me, okay?

554
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:36,550
Fine.

555
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:42,760
Maybe I wasn't entirely honest with you
 about what happened with Xiao Lu.

556
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,860
But at first I wanted Xiao Lu to disappear

557
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,530
so that you'd fall in love with Lu Tian Xing.

558
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:50,170
But you cried every day.

559
00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:52,070
No matter how I tried to comfort you

560
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:54,170
all you wanted was for Xiao Lu to come back.

561
00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:57,110
What was I supposed to do?

562
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:00,610
Let go of me, I don't want to listen to you.

563
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:02,480
Look at me!

564
00:51:02,710 --> 00:51:05,220
I also told you that I like you

565
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,420
but what did I get in return?

566
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:09,320
A smack in the face.

567
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:14,230
No matter what I did for you as Lu Tian Xing

568
00:51:14,230 --> 00:51:15,460
to you

569
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,960
I was never as good as Xiao Lu, right?

570
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,570
Look at me.

571
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:24,070
Look me in the eyes!

572
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,340
I'm Xiao Lu, Lu Tian Xing is Xiao Lu!

573
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:30,270
Whoever I am

574
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:33,980
I still truly love you!

575
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,720
- Let go of me!
 - No!

576
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,050
- Let go...
 - Tao Le Si!

577
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:41,750
Just think about it.

578
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,320
Think about what I said.

579
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,090
Then you'll know whether
 I'm lying to you or not.

580
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,160
Let go of me!

581
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:14,140
- Let go of me!
 - No!

582
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,680
- Let go...
 - Tao Le Si!

583
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,120
Just think about it.

584
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:19,820
Think about what I said.

585
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,390
Then you'll know whether
 I'm lying to you or not.

586
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:27,520
Let go of me...

587
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,330
Tao Le Si!

588
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,470
Tao Le Si!

589
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:38,040
Tao Le Si!

590
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:39,340
Huan Huan!

591
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,740
Huan Huan, hold on!

592
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:44,640
Brother Tian Xing, help me!

593
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:48,210
Hang in there, hold on tight!

594
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,560
Tao Le Si...

595
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,690
Don't ever let go.

596
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,830
Don't let go.

597
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:11,200
Don't let go.

598
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,810
Hold on tight.

599
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,140
Brother Tian Xing.

600
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,010
Huan Huan!

601
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:24,410
- What are you doing, Huan Huan?
 - Huan Huan.

602
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,480
- Huan Huan, don't!
 - No, Huan Huan...

603
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,690
Huan Huan!

604
00:53:30,590 --> 00:53:32,320
Huan Huan!

605
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,660
Tao Le Si, look at me!

606
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,010
Huan Huan!

607
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,760
Huan Huan, hang in there!

608
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,500
I'll take you to the hospital, okay?

609
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,230
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

610
00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:20,170
- Don't be scared.
 - It really hurts!

611
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:23,010
Don't cry, okay?

612
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,740
I'll always protect you.

613
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:30,380
Huan Huan, hang in there!

614
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,220
- Huan Huan...
 - Don't fall asleep!

615
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:42,090
Huan Huan.

616
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,760
Hang in there, okay?

617
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,530
Huan Huan...

618
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:51,970
Tao Le Si, drive faster.

619
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,980
Come and help me!

620
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,220
Where's the doctor?

621
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:14,590
Go home first, okay?

622
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,670
How's she looking?

623
00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:24,170
Female, fell off a cliff and injured her neck.

624
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:26,470
Currently unconscious.

625
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,180
- Ask the family to wait outside.
 - Sorry, please wait outside.

626
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:35,750
Please wait here.

627
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:49,930
You silly girl.

628
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:53,000
Why did you do such a silly thing?

629
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:56,200
Tian Xing, Huan Huan...

630
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,870
Mom.

631
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:05,780
The doctor said her neck
 injury's quite complicated.

632
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:08,110
She might get better

633
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:10,710
but it might also affect her
 walking in the future.

634
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:13,020
No!

635
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:16,550
Huan Huan's always been
 my most beautiful princess.

636
00:56:16,550 --> 00:56:19,960
Something like this can't happen to her.

637
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,230
Brother Tian Xing.

638
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:07,300
You're finally awake.

639
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,170
Can you...

640
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:15,510
help me sit up a little?

641
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,450
Sure.

642
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,060
Thank you.

643
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:32,700
You don't have to thank me.

644
00:57:34,670 --> 00:57:37,230
Of course I do.

645
00:57:37,230 --> 00:57:40,870
Thank you for keeping me company.

646
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:53,150
What happened to me?

647
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,420
You injured your neck.

648
00:58:06,530 --> 00:58:09,230
So am I going to get better?

649
00:58:10,430 --> 00:58:13,740
<i>The doctor said her neck
 injury's quite complicated.</i>

650
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,110
<i>She might get better</i>

651
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,410
<i>but it might also affect her
 walking in the future.</i>

652
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:24,880
Brother Tian Xing.

653
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:28,520
Make sure you rest it well

654
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:32,490
and go through physical therapy, okay?

655
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,180
My legs don't have any feeling.

656
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:03,950
My legs can't feel anything.

657
00:59:08,530 --> 00:59:11,860
My legs can't feel a thing.

658
00:59:22,570 --> 00:59:24,510
Huan Huan...

659
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:26,840
Don't think too much.

660
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,910
My legs can't feel a thing!

661
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,670
My legs can't feel a thing!

662
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,940
I can't feel anything!

663
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,910
No... no!

664
00:59:59,910 --> 01:00:02,710
Brother Tian Xing, no!

665
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:11,150
My legs can't feel a thing!

666
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,460
Huan Huan.

667
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:47,360
Leo.

668
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:49,590
Miao Miao.

669
01:00:50,090 --> 01:00:51,760
Jia Gai Xian.

670
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:54,230
I have something to tell you.

671
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,000
OZ's boss...

672
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,070
is now Lu Tian Xing.

673
01:01:10,010 --> 01:01:11,580
Starting now

674
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:15,720
he might walk in any minute
 and ask us to leave.

675
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,990
Lu Tian Xing...

676
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,760
is actually Xiao Lu.

677
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:30,430
- What? You said...
 - Lu Tian Xing is Xiao Lu?

678
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:38,610
It was Lu Tian Xing who gave us the money

679
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:42,610
for the bid bond for those four projects.

680
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,110
So he's now OZ's boss.

681
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:47,750
Tao Zi.

682
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:50,050
When did you find out?

683
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,020
That's not important.

684
01:01:54,690 --> 01:01:56,890
Did he tell you himself?

685
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:05,970
I'm sorry.

686
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,510
I've failed to keep OZ for you.

687
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,840
Tao Zi, who told you?

688
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,380
Leo.

689
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:24,750
Did you know about it already?

690
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:31,630
I only doubted him at first.

691
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:35,160
Then I slowly managed to confirm it.

692
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:38,270
Then why didn't you tell me?

693
01:02:41,740 --> 01:02:43,410
Because Xiao Lu...

694
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:48,380
who was also Lu Tian Xing, really likes you.

695
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:56,650
You were always happy whenever
 you were with Xiao Lu.

696
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:00,490
I only want you to be happy.

697
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,460
You should have told me.

698
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,930
You should have told me

699
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:15,670
that I fell in love with someone
 who doesn't exist.

700
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,540
A liar.

701
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:24,480
How could he do that?

702
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:27,550
He made Boss fall in love with Xiao Lu and
 we all treated him as our friend.

703
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,350
But he lied to us all.

704
01:03:29,350 --> 01:03:31,390
That's so mean.

705
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:33,490
Xiao Lu is Lu Tian Xing

706
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:35,820
and Lu Tian Xing is Xiao Lu.

707
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,430
So when he called me Ma Gai...

708
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:42,300
he actually did it on purpose.

709
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,570
I liked Xiao Lu and treated
 him as my best buddy.

710
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:50,940
But he only treated me like an idiot.

711
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,310
Tao Zi.

712
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:38,520
Don't worry.

713
01:04:39,150 --> 01:04:44,190
I'm prepared to face this fact.

714
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:01,680
Jia Gai Xian, what are you doing?

715
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:04,010
Can't you tell? Packing my things!

716
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:05,580
Now that Lu Tian Xing's our boss

717
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,420
he's going to kick us out sooner or later.

718
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,470
Here.

719
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:42,280
Huan Huan, eat something.

720
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:45,420
I don't feel like eating.

721
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:47,860
Just a little bit more, okay?

722
01:05:47,860 --> 01:05:49,720
No.

723
01:05:49,860 --> 01:05:52,130
Then tell me what you feel like having.

724
01:05:52,130 --> 01:05:54,560
I can go and buy it for you, okay?

725
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,530
Don't worry about me.

726
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:00,740
Of course we're worried.

727
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:06,670
Steven has always told me to keep an eye
 on my weight.

728
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:10,310
I might as well go on a diet now.

729
01:06:10,580 --> 01:06:14,480
You silly girl, you should let your body
 recover first.

730
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:29,060
Auntie, let me try.

731
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:40,610
You want fish? It's good for you.

732
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:43,850
Here.

733
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,890
You want some egg as well?

734
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:03,130
How about this?

735
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:05,870
Tell me what you feel like eating

736
01:07:05,870 --> 01:07:07,370
and I'll remember

737
01:07:07,370 --> 01:07:11,040
to bring it to the hospital for you, okay?

738
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:12,910
Really?

739
01:07:12,910 --> 01:07:14,480
Yeah.

740
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:20,120
- You promise?
 - I promise.

741
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,720
I won't force you to finish this, okay?

742
01:07:35,060 --> 01:07:37,600
Tian Xing...

743
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,700
Are you going to come back?

744
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:40,840
Of course.

745
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,500
Like I said just then

746
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:44,910
I'll bring some food for Huan Huan

747
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:48,440
after I go home and freshen up.

748
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:52,510
As you know, Huan Huan doesn't usually
 show her true emotions.

749
01:07:52,510 --> 01:07:56,380
Her injury must have given her a big shock.

750
01:07:59,550 --> 01:08:00,760
I know that.

751
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:03,190
I'll help her get through it.

752
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:06,230
She wouldn't tell us what actually happened.

753
01:08:06,230 --> 01:08:08,130
But based on what you said

754
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:12,330
she got hurt while trying to save you
 and Tao Le Si.

755
01:08:13,470 --> 01:08:16,370
I don't mean to probe into your problem
 with Tao Le Si

756
01:08:16,370 --> 01:08:17,940
but Huan Huan...

757
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:25,680
I can't bear to see her
 sacrifice so much for you

758
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,920
while you totally neglect her.

759
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:38,190
I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

760
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:41,230
I want you to care about her.

761
01:08:42,130 --> 01:08:43,430
Whether she'll get better or not

762
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:44,500
or whether she'll walk again

763
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:47,970
even if she's not the one that you like...

764
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:51,870
don't ever let her get hurt
 because of you again.

765
01:08:58,180 --> 01:08:59,880
Okay.

766
01:09:00,650 --> 01:09:04,390
I'll remember what you said.

767
01:09:31,810 --> 01:09:34,480
Have some hot milk.

768
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:36,750
Thank you.

769
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,700
Are you okay?

770
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,900
No, I'm not.

771
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:09,650
Tao Zi.

772
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:13,190
If you ever need me...

773
01:10:14,790 --> 01:10:17,890
if it's okay with you

774
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:21,960
I'll always be here for you.

775
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,600
I want to be more than your brother.

776
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,100
For you...

777
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:02,670
and for OZ...

778
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:09,180
I'll always be here.

779
01:11:50,665 --> 01:11:53,495
