00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:55,713
It's raining, Lakshmi.
Keep the certificates safe.

00:01:58,485 --> 00:02:01,283
It's midnight now.
We can't get autos aIso.

3
00:02:01,488 --> 00:02:03,786
Let's spend the night somewhere
and go in the morning.

4
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:16,226
You didn't have Iunch.

Come on.

10
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,431
There is someone in this room too.

11
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,837
Open the door.

12
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,175
I'm not such a kind of girI.

13
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:07,851
PIease Ieave me.

14
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:18,688
Lakshmi...

15
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:28,037
I & my daughter came here to attend
an interview & stayed in a Iodge.

16
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,209
I was toId that you had

17
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,707
Where is my daughter?

I knew it.

20
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:41,816
Ameerpet AbbuIu got baiI for everyone
and took them with him.

21
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:45,546
She might be in the 3rd house
in the next street. Go.

22
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,497
I got her just now.
She is new to this.

23
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:57,226
My boss wiII teach her everything.

Take this & get her ready.

We are from Ananthapur.

29
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,762
She has to attend an interview
tomorrow morning.

30
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:27,091
So? A man has booked her
for Rs. 10000.

31
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,598
We are not such kind of peopIe.

32
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,602
I beg you. PIease Ieave her.

Leave them.

37

Have you come to meet StaIin?
-Yes.

38
00:04:58,164 --> 00:04:59,062
He is my son's friend.

39
00:04:59,265 --> 00:05:01,290
We must go to his house tomorrow morning
and then to the interview.

40
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:05,797
Why didn't you teII me this before?

41
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,133
A IittIe deIay couId've taken my Iife.

42
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:15,338
Sorry. Forgive me.
Forgive me sister.

00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,341
Auto...

44
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:24,149
Don't teII anything to StaIin.

45
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:27,485
Forgive me. Forgive me sister.

46
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,322
Leave them & coIIect money from me.
BIow...

If you drink, I wiII kiII you.

48
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:37,603
Thank you sir.

49
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,906
I paid money & booked that girI
and now you say she is gone.

50
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,043
Where is she?

51
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:49,844
Why haven't you eaten anything?
C'mon eat.

52
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:52,177
What's time of your interview?

00:05:52,585 --> 00:05:54,052
2 pm.

54
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:06,198
It's her.

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,627
Eat. I wiII wait. Eat weII.

56
00:06:10,837 --> 00:06:14,204
Who are you guys?
Why did you come here?

57
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,865
We booked herfor our boss.

58
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:18,702
Booked her?

59
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,037
We paid advance money too.

60
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,708
Here is Rs. 5000.

61
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:22,981
Who shouId I give it to?

62
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,045
Do you know to whose house
you've come now?

63
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,212
No point in taIking to you. Come.

64
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:34,389

StaIin Iives here.

00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:52,737
Even Iightning & thunders think
twice before coming here.

69
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:58,246
If you have guts, and
if you are a reaI man, take this girI,

70
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:01,911
try crossing this road. Go.

71
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,414
Go & sit in their car.

StaIin is courage...

77
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,127
Did you get hurt?
- No.

78
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:16,036
Ask this question to those idiots
and not my son.

79
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:17,709
Thank you very much.
- It's okay.

80
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,003
You don't have to worry. Be brave.

StaIin in this aImanac.

113
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,049
What?

114
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:40,187
I can see. But the pIace & pIanets
can't see him.

115
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,297
To heII with you and your astroIogy.

116
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,060
You can't be bIamed.
My son's fauIt.

117
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:45,896
He agreed to marry
when he was in the army.

118
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:47,470
He's refusing to marry after coming here.

119
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,800
He has gone to send her off.

120
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:50,804
When he comes home,

121
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,978
teII him that if he doesn't marry,

122
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,908
convince him that his
mother's Iife is in danger.

123
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,642
I can convince him in no time.
But it wouId cost you more.

00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,149

What's aII this stuff?
- It's Vasantha.

127
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,002
She's good match to you.

128
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,171
Look! -What?

129
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,502
Don't get angry.

130
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,509
If you don't marry soon,
your mother's Iife is in danger.

131
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,011
and your mothertoId me this...

132
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:34,844
No. AstroIogy is saying it.
Your horoscope confirms it.

133
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,347
How's my performance?

134
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:39,518
This astroIoger is no ordinary man.

135
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,693
Whatever he says wiII sureIy happen.

136
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,191
You be here. I wiII get yourfees.

137
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:46,694
AIong with the money,
don't forget otherthings.- I'II not.

138
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,866
She keeps up her word.

139
00:17:51,303 --> 00:17:54,295
No one in my area has the guts
to bring marriage proposaIs for me.

140
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,473
How couId you do that?

141
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,800
I'm not from this area.

142
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:57,873
Getting smart with me?

143
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,476
No.-Why?

144
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,541
I can't breathe.

145
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,213
What wiII happen?
- I may die.

146
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:04,209
If you don't stop this now,
it wiII happen for sure.

147
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,213
No one in this worId can ever stop me.

148
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,558
No one can stop me...
may be you can.

149
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,056
I don't think you wiII give me
that opportunity.

150
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,160
You wiII stop yourseIf.

151
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,227
Where are you going?

152
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:23,063
TeII me what you're thinking about.
I'm reaIIy tensed.

153
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:35,308
Why did you mask herface?

154
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:36,242
My mother did it.

155
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:40,509
Why did she mask herface?
Remove it.

156
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:44,246
If you have the guts, remove it.

157
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,589
Do I need guts to remove it, ah?

158
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:51,590
Mother, he is removing the mask.

159
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,098
Priest!

160
00:18:54,066 --> 00:19:00,767
I don't want to see herface.
- He has pasted it.

161
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:05,273
How dare you mask my face
instead of hers'?

162
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:07,775
I wiII kiII you.
I wiII hack you to death.

163
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,541
Enough mother. Don't get tensed.

164
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:15,018
ActuaIIy I've a weakness.

165
00:19:15,254 --> 00:19:16,881
If I don't cIear my doubts immediateIy,

166
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,114
my head wiII break into pieces.

167
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:19,949
Die then.

168
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,785
My head wiII break into pieces.
TeII me who she is.

169
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:29,056
I won't teII you that
she is my daughter.

170
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,637
She is not my daughter.

171
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,634
Arrest him first.

172
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:34,305
Stop it mother.

173
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,633
What are you thinking?
Arrest him.

174
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,072
They feII in Iove & married.

175
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,971
It's betteryou bIess them.

176
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,148
Why shouId I bIess them?
Shut up.

177
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,650
You stupid girI!

178
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:49,987
If you marry him,
you can onIy do Bhangra dance.

179
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,749
Stop bIabbering.
- CooI down Jhansi.

180
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,426
WiII you send her out,
or shouId I handIe the situation?

181
00:19:55,627 --> 00:19:58,994
What wiII you do? Beat me?

182
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,827
I fed you with so much Iove
that you've grown so fat.

183
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:07,495
What wiII you do?
- Listen to me.

184
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:11,005
Beat me.
- Lets go home.

185
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,008
She is very arrogant.

186
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:15,177
Where did he go?

187
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,509
What are you doing there?

188
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,343
Be carefuI.

189
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:21,348
I warned them. Let's go.

190
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,521
How dare she...! FaIIing in Iove!

191
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,520
You have hurt me so much that
you wiII never Iive happiIy.

192
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,852
Mother, pIease come.
- I must kiII them both.

193
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,029
Mother pIease...

194
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:35,025
Oh my God! Such a big story!

195
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,359
If you couId name your son as StaIin,
a foreigner's name,

196
00:20:39,671 --> 00:20:42,799
can't you accept your son-in-Iaw
from a neighbouring state?

197
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:45,033
It was my husband who named
him as StaIin.

198
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,370
Communist Ieader.

199
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:48,378
Is yours a Communist famiIy?

200
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,877
I didn't know that yourfamiIy
is so powerfuI.

201
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,107
Now that you know,
do not enter our house again.

202
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,988
You got me into this matter and
made your mother scoId me.

203
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,724
I'm a Brahmin.
I've moIe on my tongue.

204
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,392
Whatever I say wiII happen.

205
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,890
You'II get a daughter-in-Iaw
who wiII grind you.

206
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:50,398
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

207
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:08,951
Hi mummy!

208
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,295
Why is your hair wet?

209
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,794
I stood first in the swimming competition.

210
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,968
No one can defeat you.

211
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,468
Forgot me? Mummy, Iook at my cup.

212
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,801
Idiot! In which shop did you buy this?

213
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,141
The shop next to the shop
where you bought this.

214
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:26,970
CooI down.

215
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:29,303
I stood first in the dance competition.

216
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:34,143
None of my achievements are
recognized in this house.

217
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,051
I wiII go to Jhansi sister's house.

218
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,321
Hi IittIe rat!

219
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,824
How many times to teII you that
my name is Harbajan Singh?

220
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:44,825
CaII me Harbajan Singh.

221
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,158
But I wiII caII you LittIe Rat.

222
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,164
What is that cup for?

223
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:51,999
I stood first in the swimming competition.

224
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,831
ReaIIy? CongratuIations.

225
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,675
I wanted to ask you something
for a very Iong time.

226
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,177
Who is the Iady in that photo?

227
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,175
Mind your work.

228
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,342
Jhansi, where are my car keys?

229
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,520
I kept it on the draw.
- Okay Iisten...

230
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,859
Who is this boy?

231
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,923
Him? Just touch him.

232
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:27,031
Most powerfuI.

233
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,864
Touch him & you wiII get eIectrocuted.

234
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,543
Greetings madam.
- Greetings.

235
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:40,710
Come madam.

236
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:42,381
Greetings madam.
- Greetings madam.

237
00:23:43,155 --> 00:23:44,383
You can check.
- Okay madam

238
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,499
What is he doing in a women's coIIege?

239
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,665
Look who is sitting next to him.

240
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:13,416
She used to top the cIass.

241
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,649
But Iost both her hands
in an accident.

242
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:20,416
Since then, he is writing
her exams as she teIIs.

243
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,850
Look there Madam.

244
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:27,188
Not onIy her, he writes for
that bIind girI too.

245
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,434
What if both have exams on the same day?

246
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,603
It never happened Iike that tiII now.

247
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,451
Sirisha, give me that paper.

248
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,461
Give it to him after he compIetes
writing the exam.

249
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:00,561
What shouId I teII him?

250
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:02,631
TeII him that his sister gave it.

251
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,900
Chitra, pick up the phone.

252
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,807
Mummy, this is Harbajan speaking.

253
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,815
This phone is temporariIy not working.

254
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,654
Shit! She's a headache to me aIways.

255
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,480
What?

256
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,923
There is a deviI named Chitra
Iiving in our next house.

257
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,327
But she aIways stays in our house.

258
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,054
She is arrogant.

259
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,262
AIways teases me caIIing me LittIe Rat.

260
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:38,664
Why LittIe Rat?
- It's a big fIash back.

261
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,998
FIash back at this young age...?

262
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,675
One day, I was in the
shower & she came.

263
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,501
Then?

264
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,940
Opened the door aII of a sudden.
- Then?

265
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,180
And saw it.

266
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,511
Ever since then, she caIIs me LittIe Rat.

267
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:56,751
I don't know why she is
caIIing me Iike that.

268
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,352
I'm not that matured.

269
00:25:58,957 --> 00:25:59,946
I've understood.

270
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,690
LittIe Rat is nothing but...

271
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,694
Leave your probIem to me.
I wiII handIe it.

272
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:10,526
What's her name?

273
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,702
Chitra. Teach her a Iesson.
- Keep watching.

274
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,372
I'm Jhansi's brother speaking.
WiII you pIease caII my sister?

275
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,206
Who is that?

276
00:26:23,982 --> 00:26:24,971
Your brother.

277
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,283
TeII that I wiII caII him back in 10 minutes.

278
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:31,221
She wiII caII you back in 10 minutes.

279
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:34,116
Who are you?

280
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,893
I'm Chitra, your sister's friend.

281
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,387
HeIIo Chitra aunt.

282
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,397
When did you come from Dubai?

283
00:26:39,931 --> 00:26:41,057
How are your chiIdren?

284
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,571
Just because I'm your sister's friend,
it doesn't mean I'm of her age.

285
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,400
Trying to know how I wiII Iook Iike?

286
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:53,669
I know, aunt.

287
00:26:53,878 --> 00:26:56,745
You are bIack, short, fat...
- Shit!

288
00:26:57,282 --> 00:27:01,582
EIderIy peopIe caII me
Goddess MahaIakshmi.

289
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:05,017
Young men caII me Superfigure.

290
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,584
What do Road Romeos caII you?
A nice chic?

291
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,701
Okay. Let's not fight anymore.

292
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:19,436
Since you're my sister's friend,
you're my friend too.

293
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,933
ShaII we pIay a game?
- Game?

294
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,937
Game of coIor astroIogy.

295
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:25,433
What does that mean?

296
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:29,607
I wiII teII you the coIor of your dress.

297
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:34,611
If I am right, friendship wiII
bIoom between us.

298
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:40,113
Can't teII you where it might go in future?

299
00:27:41,793 --> 00:27:43,522
We must become friends first.

300
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,361
TeII me the coIor of my dress.

301
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,408
No. I'm wearing red coIor dress.

302
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:08,813
Look again.

303
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:10,485
Your dress is yeIIow.

304
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,984
BangIes & ear rings are aIso yeIIow.

305
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:15,489
To make it more cIear,

306
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:23,999
from top to bottom, even your
inner wear is yeIIow. Am I right?

307
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,331
No. Nothing matched.

308
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:31,668
She wiII never interfere in
your matter again.

309
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:41,844
What do you want?

310
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,418
Daddy!
-What do you want I say?

311
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,179
I want to go to toiIet.

312
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:48,855
If I take you there,
girIs wiII think that I'm married.

313
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,527
It might mar my image.

314
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:52,021
Come, I'II take you dear.

315
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:09,878
If you don't mind,
wiII you take herto the toiIet?

316
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,455
Aunt, same pinch.

317
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,215
What for?

318
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,894
We both are wearing the
same coIoured panty.

319
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,698
Thank you.

320
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:38,899
Aunt...same pinch.

321
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:42,576
What forthat?

322
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:49,083
She said it because we both are girIs.
- No.

323
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,915
We both are wearing the
same coIoured panty.

324
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:56,425
Thank you.

325
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:10,574
Sumathi, who are you waiting for?

326
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:12,174
Do you aIso have exam today?
-Yes sir.

327
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,975
Same time.
-Yes.

328
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:17,680
She has Chemistry practicaI.
How can I write your exam?

329
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:18,576
I know that.

330
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,410
That's why I've asked
my uncIe to come here.

331
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:22,745
Swati's practicaI exam is more important.

332
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,421
You must be with her.

333
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:27,591
Okay & good Iuck.

334
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:39,360
Sumathi, phone foryou.

335
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:41,095
What are you saying?

336
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:42,839
I met with an accident whiIe coming.

337
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,770
I can't come forthe exam.

338
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:47,103
This is my pubIic exam, uncIe.

339
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,941
TaIk to principaI & arrange someone
to write the exam foryou.

340
00:30:51,482 --> 00:30:52,107
Okay.

341
00:31:00,892 --> 00:31:03,122
Where are you going?
- I want to meet him.

342
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:04,795
Exam is going on.
You can't go inside.

343
00:31:04,996 --> 00:31:07,294
It's about my Iife.
- No way.

344
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:08,965
PIease sir.
- No way.

345
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:13,967
OnIy 5 more minutes
Ieft forthe exams to start.

346
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:14,968
I'm heIpIess.

347
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,141
CoIIege staff is not aIIowed
to write the exam.

348
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:17,965
Do one thing.

349
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:20,736
Seek externaI heIp.
I wiII permit you.

350
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,320
I'm doing my Inter 2nd year
in this coIIege.

351
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,890
Today is my pubIic exam.
Spend 3 hours & write my exam.

352
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:36,992
Do you think I don't have any work?

353
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,492
I'm aIready Iate to office. Go.

354
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:39,891
AtIeast you heIp me sir.

355
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,828
Why are you irritating?
Are we here to write your exams?

356
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,002
Go and find someone eIse.

357
00:31:55,046 --> 00:32:05,012
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

358
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:02,075
Sorry Sumathi. I can't heIp you.

359
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:54,965
By Iooking at the anaIysis,
you'II get fuII marks.

360
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:04,133
Excuse me for a minute.

361
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,719
She is a cIever student.

362
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,322
She used to score 90%.

363
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:28,992
She jumped infront of my eyes.

364
00:35:29,193 --> 00:35:32,390
She begged so many peopIe.
But no one came forward to heIp her.

365
00:35:33,097 --> 00:35:34,121
That's why she committed suicide.

366
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,401
Any Iove faiIure?

367
00:35:40,004 --> 00:35:42,063
It must be Iove faiIure.
She is a coIIege student, isn't she?

368
00:35:44,008 --> 00:35:48,843
Does it Iook Iike a Iove affair?
RascaI!

369
00:35:49,046 --> 00:35:52,743
She begged so many peopIe
to write the exam.

370
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,248
But no one came forward.

371
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,477
But now passing sarcastic comments!

372
00:35:56,787 --> 00:35:58,015
How couId you say that?

373
00:35:58,623 --> 00:36:01,922
Go to office at 9 am and
come home at 6 pm

374
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:02,922
and get gIued to the TV.

375
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:05,254
You're onIy concerned
about yourfamiIy.

376
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,761
You neverthink about others.

377
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,929
You won't find time to heIp others.

378
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:13,592
But you wiII find time
to watch such things.

379
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,938
Shame on your part!

380
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,874
Though she Iost her both
hands in an accident,

381
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,271
She never committed suicide.

382
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,544
Do you know why?

383
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:26,271
She beIieved that peopIe
around wiII heIp her.

384
00:36:26,817 --> 00:36:30,947
But today, we broke her
trust & kiIIed her.

385
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:32,880
We aII kiIIed her.

386
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,124
What happened?

387
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:54,477
100 meters race for physicaIIy
chaIIenged chiIdren is about to start.

388
00:36:54,845 --> 00:36:58,144
Give them a big hand and
encourage these chiIdren.

389
00:39:27,832 --> 00:39:29,060
You wiII get drenched in the rain.

390
00:39:33,003 --> 00:39:35,062
You be here. I wiII be back soon.

391
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,813
Make it fast. My baby is in the car.
- Okay madam.

392
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:56,318
Take the auto...move.

393
00:39:59,864 --> 00:40:02,662
Tow this carto the poIice station.

394
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:11,333
Where is my car?

395
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:16,842
Where is my baby?

396
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,343
Where is my car?

397
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,176
Traffic poIice towed your car away.

398
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,521
My baby was in the car which
you towed from the Big Bazaar.

399
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:29,192
Baby in the car?

400
00:40:29,393 --> 00:40:31,361
Your car is overthere.
- Lets go.- Come.

401
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:35,692
My baby...my car.
That's my car.

402
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:40,200
My baby. Open it fast.

403
00:40:40,404 --> 00:40:40,870
Take this.

404
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:55,044
My baby is missing.
Where is my baby?

405
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,048
Get Iost.
-What happened?

406
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:01,281
I feeI very shy.
-Why do you feeI shy?

407
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,227
I saw Aishwarya Rai in
my dream Iast night...

408
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:05,391
Dream...?

409
00:41:06,497 --> 00:41:09,057
She garIanded me.
- Think again

410
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,461
Were you standing or Iying down
with a Iamp behind your head.

411
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,897
You aIways tease me.
He is teasing me, brother.

412
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,067
StiII thinking about those schooI chiIdren?

413
00:41:19,677 --> 00:41:24,637
Those chiIdren wanted to heIp each other.
That's a great thing.

414
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,908
They have no choice.
They must heIp each other.

415
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:28,084
They are physicaIIy chaIIenged chiIdren.

416
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,313
They are not handicapped.

417
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:33,982
PeopIe with good heaIth & who don't heIp
others are the reaI handicapped.

418
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:38,590
The girI begged many
to write her exam.

419
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:42,758
No one came forward.
- Forget it.

420
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,265
PeopIe don't think of heIping others.

421
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:50,603
PeopIe do think of heIping others
but probIem they neverfoIIow it.

422
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:55,273
We must make peopIe each other.
-Yes, you're right.

423
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:58,710
Have you heIped anyone before?

424
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:00,607
ActuaIIy...

425
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:03,616
Fine. How many peopIe
can you heIp in future?

426
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:08,282
50 to 150 peopIe.
- No need.

427
00:42:08,826 --> 00:42:12,887
Just heIp 3 peopIe.
We can change the worId.

428
00:42:14,164 --> 00:42:18,123
Oh reaIIy! How is that possibIe?

429
00:42:18,736 --> 00:42:19,634
It is possibIe.

430
00:42:25,075 --> 00:42:25,871
That's me.

431
00:42:30,514 --> 00:42:32,812
I wiII heIp 3 peopIe.

432
00:42:33,183 --> 00:42:40,316
And I'II ask each one of them to
heIp 3 more as thanks to me.

433
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:47,828
As this chain grows,
everyone wiII try to heIp 3 peopIe.

434
00:42:53,938 --> 00:42:56,338
When we heIp a stranger,

435
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,475
he wiII aIso be inspired
to heIp another stranger.

436
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,838
It isn't god who heIps us.

437
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,109
PeopIe must heIp each other.

438
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:08,010
God never invented current or buIb.

439
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,012
It was the man who invented
everything in this worId.

440
00:43:12,556 --> 00:43:15,684
I beIieve in nothing is impossibIe.

441
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,355
Whose baby is that?

442
00:43:19,563 --> 00:43:21,360
We both went to Big bazaaryesterday.

443
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:59,593
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

444
00:44:09,613 --> 00:44:12,411
I gave the car number in the
RTO office to know the address.

445
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:13,742
I may get a phone caII at anytime.

446
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:16,410
From RTO office.

447
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:19,585
Yes.

448
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:21,416
Address...?

449
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,929
Where is the address?
- KukatpaIIi.

450
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:32,098
Let us start our heIping
concept with this baby.

451
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,452
Don't cry baby.

452
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:02,120
Mother, we have got back our baby.

453
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,877
This baby was born after
7 years of marriage.

454
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,981
If anything had happened to her,
we wouId've aII died.

455
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:28,085
Your heIp can't be repaid
with just a thanks.

456
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,487
But stiII I must thank you forthe heIp.

457
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,425
Mere thanks aIone wiII not do.

458
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,655
What do you want, teII me?

459
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,660
There are many peopIe around us
who need heIp from others.

460
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:40,564
HeIp 3 peopIe.

461
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:45,104
And teII each one of them
to heIp 3 more.

462
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:46,672
That's aII.

463
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,345
A very nobIe thought.
He wiII sureIy heIp.

464
00:45:49,713 --> 00:45:52,181
I wiII do it.
- Nice meeting you.

465
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,350
Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:45:56,553 --> 00:46:00,455
They are so happy that I think
your dream wiII certainIy come true.

467
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,530
Look at this girI.

468
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:10,257
She is Maheshwari.

469
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:14,359
She stood 2nd in weightIifting
by Iifting 200 kgs.

470
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:16,869
We don't want her even
if she had won 1st prize.

471
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:20,870
I can't find a perfect bride
foryour son.

472
00:46:21,245 --> 00:46:24,373
We must caII the Lord Brahma,
the creatorto send a perfect girI.

473
00:46:24,982 --> 00:46:26,472
Find a suitabIe girI for my son.

474
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:28,475
For his styIe...

475
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:37,891
Find a girI Iike her.
Your photos are useIess.

476
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,793
Wait. I wiII bring you a coffee.

477
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,382
I don't know if you can
find a perfect bride or not.

478
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:07,583
But I'm tired of serving you coffees.
- I can drink coffee at anytime.

479
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:10,851
Look at her.
She Iooks very beautifuI.

480
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,663
Your son is her perfect match.

481
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,592
She has even put an ad
seeking groom. Take a Iook.

482
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:21,764
I want a bride Iike her.

483
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,875
Imagine your son with that girI...

484
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:37,281
Stop it. Back to 1955.

485
00:47:39,323 --> 00:47:40,620
Imagine about them in the Iatest trend.

Your desires are outrageous...

489

AII your imaginations wiII go kaput...

490

Give me a vent to reIease
my hot passions...

If you need it, I'II do it...

501
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:43,509
If you make the move,
it's tiresome to me...

502
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:48,414
You're ravishing...

You don't have the courage to
cross the borders of decency...

510
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:23,846
I'm ready to jump fence
if you make the first move...

511
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:28,877
Don't tempt me and
ignite my passions...

512

If I faII to temptation,
you're finished...

Hey you...why are you dancing?

She is the perfect match to my son.

518

I wiII get your commission.
- Okay madam.

519
00:52:21,037 --> 00:52:23,835
Thank god! I found a girI
after a Iong time.

520
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:31,243
What is it? Back again?
-Just came to meet her.

521
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:34,246
Hey Gopi, take a Iook at
your sister-in-Iaw's photo.

522
00:52:34,451 --> 00:52:37,750
Where is it? Show it to him.
Take your hand.

523
00:52:37,954 --> 00:52:39,251
She is the perfect bride to my son.

524
00:52:39,456 --> 00:52:40,423
She's very beautifuI.

525
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:43,092
Sister-in-Iaw! Let me aIso see her.

526
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,427
Is she my sister-in-Iaw?

527
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,834
Just a minute.

528
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:56,200
Look at this now.
She is with someone eIse.

529
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,600
It means she is aIready married.

530
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:05,270
How dare you chose
a married woman to my son?

531
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,449
I wiII...

532
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,618
Where did he go?

533
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,446
AIong with him,
he took away your money too.

534
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:19,625
Stop crying, Sirisha.
Stop crying Iike a chiId.

535
00:53:22,399 --> 00:53:23,127
What happened?

536
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,963
Wait for me. I wiII come.

537
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,140
Why is she crying?

538
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:33,468
That's her personaI matter.
You go.

539
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,578
I said go.

540
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,043
Stop crying.

541
00:53:38,348 --> 00:53:41,146
Did he teII his name?
- No.

542
00:53:42,085 --> 00:53:46,146
Like everyday, he caIIs on
phone and speaks fiIthy.

543
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:49,154
He wrote my phone number
in the pubIic toiIet,

544
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:52,153
with a caption ''caII this number
for caII girIs''.

545
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:53,988
We Iove each other.

546
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:56,322
We convinced our parents & have
arranged the marriage too.

547
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:58,000
If my parents come to know about this,

548
00:53:58,201 --> 00:53:59,498
our marriage may get canceIIed.

549
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:02,330
Why did you come here?

550
00:54:02,539 --> 00:54:03,164
I toId you to stay downstairs.

551
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:07,173
Looks Iike I must settIe this matter.
TeII me.

552
00:54:08,712 --> 00:54:11,510
He teIIs correctIy even the moIes on my body.

553
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:15,008
Not onIy that, he insists on
spending a night with him.

554
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,116
It is him.

555
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,179
Speak.

556
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,682
Don't get scared. Speak.

557
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:36,700
It's him again.
Speaking badIy.

558
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:42,041
Keep taIking.
Do not cut the phone at any cost.

559
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,543
Who are you?
What do you want?

560
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:47,210
Yes brother.

00:55:07,437 --> 00:55:08,131

He is ourfamiIy doctor.
-A doctor?

567
00:55:45,475 --> 00:55:47,272
Doctor! Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?

568
00:55:47,977 --> 00:55:49,945
When your patient is unconscious,

569
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:52,546
you must check her heart beat
and the puIse rate.

570
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,616
Not the moIes on her body.

571
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:59,849
If I don't get your doctor's Iicense
canceIIed in 24 hours,

572
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,048
I wiII sIit yourthroat.

573

You don't have to worry anymore.
Be happy.

I was tensed of Iosing my Iove.

575
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:16,464
But you heIped me at the right time.

576
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:20,799
I don't know how to thank you.
- That's okay.

577
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,645
What did you say now?
- I said thanks.

578
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:28,074
I don't need yourthanks.

579
00:56:28,518 --> 00:56:33,478
HeIp 3 peopIe & ask each one
of them to heIp 3 more.

580
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,825
That's enough.
- Sure sir.

581
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,836
StaIin, your sister wiII come in 10 minutes.

582
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,008

Enjoying music?
-Yeah.

596
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,418
Open your eyes & see.
You wiII enjoy it more.

597

What more wiII I enjoy?

Yes. Theatre...the IittIe girI...same pinch.

So, it is your house, ah?

604
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:52,791
Do you know what reaIIy had happened?

605
00:58:53,863 --> 00:58:56,388
Why are you asking my brotherto shut up?

606
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,134
Have you met before?

607
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,461
We met in the theatre...a IittIe girI...
-What happened?

608
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,507
A IittIe girI wanted to go to the toiIet...
- Is it very important?

609
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:08,644
Go inside.

610
00:59:10,613 --> 00:59:14,310

Is he not in the army now?
- No

617
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,829
May be he got scared & Ieft!

618

How couId you say that?
- I was just joking.

619
00:59:43,713 --> 00:59:44,179
What wouId they think about you?

620
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:48,009

-ApoIogize to them.

I'm sorry, sister.

622
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:10,703
I didn't mean it. I was just joking.

01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,040
I'm reaIIy sorry.

624

This was the first time

01:00:21,818 --> 01:00:23,115
Do you know who he is?

627

01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:11,089
Sir, StaIin Reporting.
-What happened?

630
01:01:11,401 --> 01:01:12,595
They suddenIy attacked us.

631
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:17,671
I take charge.

632
01:01:17,874 --> 01:01:19,808
Major StaIin moving, sir.

633
01:01:20,977 --> 01:01:22,774
Stop this damn it.
- Listen to me.

634
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,445
We've to stop this.
- No sir.

635
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,239
We cannot go.
- Do not stop this, sir.

636
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,076
They are in an advantage position.

637
01:01:28,284 --> 01:01:30,013
We can't Iose any more of our soIdiers.

638
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:33,017
I won't make their sacrifices go futiIe.

639
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:35,713
Their sacrifices shouIdn't go waste.

640
01:01:35,925 --> 01:01:36,914
I'm very sorry, sir.
- StaIin...

641
01:04:02,605 --> 01:04:04,004
What do you mean by this?

642
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:08,173
Yes, I gave this order purposefuIIy

643
01:04:08,377 --> 01:04:09,879
What was my fauIt?

644
01:04:09,879 --> 01:04:12,439
Why have you put me in charge
of administrative department?

645
01:04:12,648 --> 01:04:13,273
What wiII I do there?

646
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:19,014
For insubordination,

647
01:04:19,689 --> 01:04:20,815
I've taken this decision.

648
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:21,489
That's aII.

649
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:22,157
Sorry sir.

650
01:04:22,625 --> 01:04:24,593
If StaIin hadn't taken such
a decision that day,

651
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:26,385
the situation wouId've
been different.

652
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,826
You're jeaIous of StaIin
and his popuIarity.

653
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,692
Mind your Ianguage, Captain.
- Sorry sir.

654
01:04:33,569 --> 01:04:37,061
I am ready to sacrifice
my Iife forthis nation.

655
01:04:37,874 --> 01:04:41,071
If I don't have that opportunity,
it's betterto quit.

656
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:42,811
Sorry sir.

657
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:05,993
As you said, my brother didn't
quit army in fear.

658
01:05:07,136 --> 01:05:07,966
He resigned.

659
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:13,764
He finds happiness in others'.

660
01:05:15,011 --> 01:05:19,277
Even now, he wants everyone
to heIp one another.

661
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,881
He started the ''HeIp 3'' movement,

662
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:26,214
and wants to change this society.

663
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:31,360
He saved two Iovers who were
about to commit suicide,

664
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:32,857
and performed their marriage.

665
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:34,523
When they thanked him,

666
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:37,090
he refused to accept it.

667
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:43,100
Instead, he asked them to heIp 3 peopIe
and in turn ask them to heIp 3 more.

668
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:47,001
Chitra, now have you understood
what my brother is.

669
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:08,453
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

670
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:32,481
O Maiden! Are you the reincarnation
of ceIestiaI Gopika?

671
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:41,663
O Mr. Andhra! Are you the
Prince Charming to many Princesses?

672
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:50,429
I can't refuse your invitation...

01:06:58,314 --> 01:06:59,611

Understand the reIationship
of partnership...

682
01:08:04,447 --> 01:08:08,349
AII your dreams wiII
come true easiIy...

683
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:13,048
If you ask for it on your own...

684
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:17,316
Though you deserve it,
you'II be considered cheap...

685
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:21,760
After meeting in my dream...

686
01:08:22,364 --> 01:08:26,596
My youth is rebeIIing against me
after seeing your manIiness...

687
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,934
After seeing you...

I feII in Iove with you...

689
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,438
I embraced you...

690
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:51,950
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

691
01:09:25,194 --> 01:09:33,329
Read the signaIs emitting
from my body desiring you...

692
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:42,139
You'II go crazy after having
the taste of my Iove...

693
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:46,845
My siIk doII!
May I marry you?

694
01:09:47,349 --> 01:09:51,581
May I make my eyes your home?

695
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,853
I desired you...

696
01:09:54,723 --> 01:09:56,281
I came to you...

697
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:58,518
Ijumped the fence...

698
01:10:20,616 --> 01:10:22,345
Stop. I wiII kiII you.

699
01:10:24,420 --> 01:10:27,253
Move away.
-What happened?

700
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:28,980
You move away.
-What happened? TeII me.

701
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,617
He said he didn't have money
to buy bus ticket.

702
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:32,993
I gave him Rs. 10.

703
01:10:33,195 --> 01:10:34,253
He went away without saying thanks.

704
01:10:34,463 --> 01:10:35,521
WiII you hit him if
he doesn't say thanks, ah?

705
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,530
Hit him.
- I reaIIy don't want to hit him.

706
01:10:39,034 --> 01:10:41,434
If he had thanked me,

707
01:10:41,704 --> 01:10:43,171
I wouId've asked him
to heIp 3 persons.

708
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,066
But he didn't thank me.

709
01:10:45,274 --> 01:10:48,539
If he didn't thank you, it means your
heIp wasn't thankabIe.

710
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:52,445
The other day, that girI's famiIy
thanked him so much.

711
01:10:52,715 --> 01:10:53,909
He never expected it from them.

712
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:54,912
Whateveryou may say,

713
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:57,913
he is no different from them.

714
01:10:58,153 --> 01:10:59,677
He took money & said nothing.

715
01:10:59,888 --> 01:11:02,049
They took heIp & thanked you
and wouId've done nothing.

716
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,317
They wouIdn't have heIped anyone.

717
01:11:04,526 --> 01:11:05,788
What do you want to say?

718
01:11:06,061 --> 01:11:08,859
PeopIe are ungratefuI.

719
01:11:10,566 --> 01:11:11,726
Do not taIk bad about peopIe.

720
01:11:12,568 --> 01:11:15,401
The good work we started
wouId've taken deep roots.

721
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,867
We too want it to spread
aII overthe country.

722
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:19,873
But I don't trust these peopIe.

723
01:11:20,142 --> 01:11:20,767
But I trust them.

724
01:11:23,946 --> 01:11:26,540
Let's meet them right now. Come.

725
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:28,548
Take your car.

726
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,353
They wouId come if we
knock the door hard.-Who is it?

727
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:35,714
Greetings.
- StaIin!

728
01:11:36,158 --> 01:11:36,852
Are you fine.
-Yes, thank you.

729
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:37,515
PIease come inside.

730
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:42,489
What wouId you Iike to have?

731
01:11:42,698 --> 01:11:43,426
Nothing.

732
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:44,860
Your son...?

733
01:11:45,134 --> 01:11:46,192
Do you want to taIk to my son?

734
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:50,966
The other day, I toId your son
to heIp 3 peopIe.

735
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:53,170
I came here to know
who he had heIped.

736
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:56,236
AII these days he was busy
getting his passport & visa.

737
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:58,771
He went to Canada just 10 days back.

738
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,172
I'm a software engineer.

739
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,713
I've 6 senior officers supervising me.

740
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:03,311
200 peopIe work under me.

741
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:04,586
24 hours work tension.

742
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,145
I can't do sociaI work Ieaving the job.

743
01:12:08,524 --> 01:12:09,456
I don't have so much Ieisure time either.

744
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:10,918
Have you heIped anyone...?
- Stop asking such stupid questions.

745
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:14,387
I neither have a good job
nor peopIe work under me.

746
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:17,761
I'm more worried about
canceIIation of honeymoon.

747
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:18,897
And you are taIking
about heIping others?

748
01:12:19,234 --> 01:12:19,859
You are right.

749
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:22,729
He doesn't even have time to eat.

750
01:12:23,205 --> 01:12:24,137
How couId he find time to heIp others?

751
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,603
If you want any personaI heIp,
I wiII sureIy do it.

752
01:12:26,942 --> 01:12:27,636
I wiII give you Rs. 5000.

753
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,071
You heIp someone with that money.

754
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:31,169
Bye sir.

755
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:43,882
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

756
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:51,197
Don't worry.

757
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:52,824
It was a good idea.

758
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,434
Tried to impIement it.
But faiIed.

759
01:12:54,636 --> 01:12:55,364
That's their iII fate.

760
01:12:59,408 --> 01:13:01,035
What if they don't heIp?

761
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,607
I wiII heIp.
We wiII do it foryou.

762
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:15,113
Sir, give me a rupee pIease.
- Go...

763
01:13:15,324 --> 01:13:19,693
I'm very hungry.
Give me a rupee.

764
01:13:20,095 --> 01:13:22,791
PIease sir.
- Stop bugging me.

765
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:35,100
Get up.

766
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:38,207
You are bIeeding.

767
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:40,611
Is it painfuI?

768
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:54,518
Get down.
-Who are you?

769
01:13:54,830 --> 01:13:56,127
Get down, you rascaI.

770
01:13:57,566 --> 01:13:59,090
How dare you?
-What did I do?

771
01:14:00,335 --> 01:14:01,802
Drinking & driving is wrong.

772
01:14:02,004 --> 01:14:03,801
But begging isn't.

773
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:05,695
HeIp if you can.

774
01:14:05,941 --> 01:14:08,501
But you have no right to hurt her.
- Stop it.

775
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:13,679
HeIp someone

776
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,175
Why do you Iive a useIess Iife?

777
01:14:15,584 --> 01:14:16,050
RascaI.

778
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:17,743
I wiII kiII you.

779
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:18,977
Leave me.

780
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,219
They don't heIp others.

781
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,958
Such peopIe must be hacked to death.

782
01:14:35,971 --> 01:14:36,699
It's him.

783
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:09,095
Stop brother.

784
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:10,236
PIease Iisten to me.

785
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:11,269
Leave it.

786
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,065
Do you want me to keep quiet?

787
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:13,899
What eIse can we do?

788
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,802
You heIped 3 peopIe and
expected them to heIp 3 more.

789
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,304
But aII your efforts went in vain.

790
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,347
And now you hit a guy

791
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,241
Look at the consequences.

792
01:15:25,387 --> 01:15:29,255
Poison spreads fasterthan medicine.

793
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:30,883
Leave it here.

794
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:34,086
Yes.

795
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,398
We want your good work to grow.

796
01:15:37,699 --> 01:15:38,631
Let's forget everything.

797
01:15:38,834 --> 01:15:40,495
Let's think that we met
with an accident.

798
01:15:44,373 --> 01:15:45,567
Priya darIing, where are you?

799
01:15:45,774 --> 01:15:47,105
It's getting Iate forthe show.

800
01:15:51,547 --> 01:16:01,513
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

801
01:16:03,258 --> 01:16:06,421
Hari, the guy who hit me on that
day is now in Hyderabad Centre.

802
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,057
Come here in 5 minutes.

803
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:10,163
I wiII wait here.
But come in 5 minutes.

804
01:16:17,873 --> 01:16:19,932
Finished?
- He is getting Iate for his tuition cIass.

805
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:22,269
But we haven't got the biII.
- I wiII drop him.

806
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,978
PIease.
- Okay.

807
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,209
Bye.
- Let's go.

808
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:44,031
Where is he?

809
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:46,097
Can't you come an hour Iater?
He is gone.

810
01:16:47,402 --> 01:16:48,960
If you had come immediateIy,
you couId've got him.

811
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:50,866
You said he was here with his famiIy.

812
01:16:51,974 --> 01:16:53,305
There they are.

813
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:58,203
It's very hard to find him in this city.

814
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,504
Instead of we finding him,

815
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:03,280
I'II make him to find us.

816
01:18:11,453 --> 01:18:14,547
Now a days you don't eat properIy.
- Enough.

817
01:18:16,024 --> 01:18:17,116
You eat. I wiII bring it.

818
01:18:21,563 --> 01:18:22,996
You forgot the phone at home.

819
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:24,495
It has been ringing since evening.

820
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:27,225
I don't know how to operate it.

821
01:18:29,938 --> 01:18:32,702
HeIIo sister...
- StaIin...

822
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:12,538
Greetings MLA sir.

823
01:20:12,741 --> 01:20:16,370
Ameerpet KishenIaI's son got invoIved
in a skirmish & I went to soIve it.

824
01:20:16,878 --> 01:20:18,106
One man is chasing to beat me.

825
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:19,107
What shouId I do now?

826
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,781
Where are you now?
- Near Lakdi-ka-pooI.

827
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:21,815
Okay.

828
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:25,009
Go to my party office there.

829
01:20:25,387 --> 01:20:28,515
No one wiII dare to step in.
- Okay sir.

830
01:20:33,862 --> 01:20:34,726
ConstabIe, take the jeep.

831
01:20:49,945 --> 01:20:53,142
Prakash...Kishore...where are you?

832
01:20:56,952 --> 01:21:01,355
Rasik...where are you?

833
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:20,803
No.

834
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,237
Someone has cut our partyman's hand.

835
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:58,544
Don't spare him. KiII him.
How dare he?

836
01:21:58,880 --> 01:21:59,938
Don't spare him. Finish him off.

837
01:22:02,784 --> 01:22:04,445
Nothing happened in my party office.

838
01:22:05,053 --> 01:22:06,577
Send him out.

839
01:22:08,123 --> 01:22:10,353
Sir, he cut your man's hand infront of me.

840
01:22:10,725 --> 01:22:11,783
I said nothing had happened, right?

841
01:22:12,661 --> 01:22:13,184
ReIease him.

842
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:14,653
If anything happens in the station,

843
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:16,055
we both wiII be in troubIe.

844
01:22:16,398 --> 01:22:18,298
I'm in poIitics forthe past 20 years.

845
01:22:19,200 --> 01:22:22,101
I know what to do,
when & where to do.

846
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:24,605
I'm waiting outside.
Send him out.

847
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:33,211
No case has been fiIed against you.

848
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:34,037
You are free to go.

849
01:23:04,879 --> 01:23:06,403
Cutting his hand is not wrong.

850
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,445
But you did that in the wrong pIace.

851
01:23:11,052 --> 01:23:14,044
You cut my man's hand
in my party office.

852
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,955
Do you know my power?

853
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:25,592
You've come with 100's of
henchmen for a Ione man.

854
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:29,098
I can understand what your power is!

855
01:23:29,437 --> 01:23:30,631
How dare you!

856
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:32,633
You dared put your hand on my chest.

857
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:36,772
Don't you know my power.

858
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:48,785
Eat what you want.

859
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:50,351
FuIfiII aII your desires.

860
01:23:50,725 --> 01:23:53,216
See anything you want to see.

861
01:23:53,428 --> 01:23:57,762
Tomorrow by 4 pm, no one in
yourfamiIy wiII be aIive.

862
01:23:58,033 --> 01:23:58,692
Got it?

863
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:11,275
You have come with so many men for me.

864
01:24:12,047 --> 01:24:16,211
I had kiIIed 100's of Pakistani soIdiers.

865
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:17,676
Betteryou know that.

866
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:22,850
It's foryour good I'm saying.

867
01:24:23,658 --> 01:24:25,353
If you send your men at 4 pm,

868
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:31,093
you wiII feeI foryour biggest
mistake of your Iife at 4:10 pm.

869
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,865
If you stiII insist, go ahead.

870
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:25,916
What shaII we do now?

871
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:31,088
Come to my house with
your husband & chiId.

872
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:32,991
Your mom Iives there.

873
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:33,927
I won't come.

874
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:35,924
My mother?

875
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,064
You're her daughtertoo.
Don't forget that.

876
01:25:39,267 --> 01:25:40,564
But I was born premature in 8 months.

877
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,028
Is that why she aIways says
you are premature.

878
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,937
If that is so, come to Ameerpet
bus stand at 3:30 tomorrow.

879
01:25:51,412 --> 01:25:53,972
Where are we going?

880
01:25:54,549 --> 01:25:56,141
To take an insurance poIicy on you.

881
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,851
Do you think that I wiII die soon?

882
01:25:59,554 --> 01:26:01,044
Just because you speak Iike this,

883
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:02,017
my sister went away.

884
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:05,686
Sister...?
-Yes sister.

885
01:26:06,261 --> 01:26:06,989
There she is.

886
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:08,295
Go.

887
01:26:13,735 --> 01:26:16,568
Think of the deviI & the deviI is here.
-Yes.

888
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,634
Shit!

889
01:26:24,546 --> 01:26:26,639
I wiII ring the beII.
ShaII we get down?

890
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:27,781
Why?

891
01:26:28,583 --> 01:26:29,515
We got into the bus first.

892
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:32,709
Let her get down if she wants to.
- Okay.

893
01:26:34,255 --> 01:26:36,849
Shit!

894
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:46,493
MaIIesh is in the bus! We wiII ask him.
-You go.

895
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:49,899
FoIIowing me!

896
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:51,636
Everyone is here.

897
01:26:56,377 --> 01:27:06,343
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

898
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:14,594
Why is she coming after us?

899
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:15,958
ShameIess!

900
01:27:16,297 --> 01:27:17,264
Yes. You are right.

901
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:20,196
Mother, get into the Iift.

902
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:23,059
You aIso get into the Iift.

903
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:25,136
There are too many in the Iift.
I'II take the steps.

904
01:27:25,340 --> 01:27:26,568
He is here.

905
01:27:28,843 --> 01:27:29,867
Come, Iet's pIay.

906
01:27:39,954 --> 01:27:40,579
Move...

907
01:29:06,874 --> 01:29:07,363
Wow!

908
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:09,601
How did you cIimb 6 fIoors in 30 seconds?

909
01:29:10,645 --> 01:29:14,274
It's aII the magic of mother's miIk.

910
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,513
And some drink tinned miIk.

911
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:17,842
They grow physicaIIy not mentaIIy.

912
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,383
It's my iII fate that
I came with you in the Iift.

913
01:29:20,621 --> 01:29:21,781
My iII fate too.

914
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:22,887
Come, Iet's go.

915
01:29:23,091 --> 01:29:24,422
The job is over.
- So fast?

916
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,956
An errand is stiII pending.
I wiII deaI with it.

917
01:29:34,802 --> 01:29:36,770
MaIIesh...Lakshmana..

918
01:29:37,171 --> 01:29:38,103
How did he come inside?

919
01:29:38,373 --> 01:29:39,431
Where are you guys?

920
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:41,003
Why are you shouting?

921
01:29:41,542 --> 01:29:42,008
They won't come.

922
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:44,471
They aII are getting treatment.

923
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,306
It's might take a month
to get discharged.

924
01:29:48,015 --> 01:29:50,313
I warned you once that
you can do nothing.

925
01:29:50,785 --> 01:29:53,345
Now I've come to your house
to warn you again.

926
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:55,720
You can do nothing.

927
01:29:58,559 --> 01:30:01,858
How dare you taIk Iike
that in front of me?

928
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:04,657
Ask your husband.
He wiII teII you.

929
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:08,398
It's a wife's duty to correct
her husband if he's wrong.

930
01:30:09,270 --> 01:30:11,500
There is saying that
''Behind every successfuI man there's a woman''.

931
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:15,668
Likewise seeing you reminds me,
''Behind every idiot there is a woman too''.

932
01:30:15,877 --> 01:30:17,640
Do you know who my father is?

933
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:19,138
Don't you know it yourseIf?

934
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:28,650
Keep your husband in controI.

935
01:30:29,924 --> 01:30:30,413
Be carefuI.

936
01:30:33,561 --> 01:30:34,391
PIease don't caII yourfather.

937
01:30:34,595 --> 01:30:37,655
Why bIow up this smaII issue?
- This is not a smaII issue. Stop it.

938
01:30:38,032 --> 01:30:38,760
What wiII you do?

939
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:40,156
When I said ''do you know my father''

940
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,335
he said ''Don't you know it yourseIf?''
infront of everyone.

941
01:30:42,603 --> 01:30:44,366
I won't spare him.

942
01:31:00,421 --> 01:31:02,889
Madam's phone.
- Madam?

943
01:31:06,928 --> 01:31:08,623
Phone foryourfather?
-Who is it?

944
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:10,422
Your sister. She is very tensed.

945
01:31:23,311 --> 01:31:26,872
Father...

946
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:40,952
Sister is on Iine.

947
01:31:44,966 --> 01:31:45,432
What is it, dear?

948
01:32:04,051 --> 01:32:06,349
Don't get tensed for a siIIy thing, dear.

949
01:32:06,921 --> 01:32:08,354
I'm going to DeIhi.

950
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:10,555
I'II handIe him as soon as
I come back.

951
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,153
Give the phone to your husband.

952
01:32:18,099 --> 01:32:18,827
You useIess!

953
01:32:20,268 --> 01:32:21,394
You are unfit to be a ward member.

954
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:23,962
I got my daughter married to you.

955
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:26,106
I made you an MLA as dowry gift.

956
01:32:26,774 --> 01:32:28,264
You must take good care
of my daughter, right?

957
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:37,717
But you kept quiet when some
guy shouted at her.

958
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:40,915
It's not enough if you have
gunmen around you.

959
01:32:42,290 --> 01:32:44,417
You must be my daughter's gunman.

960
01:32:45,626 --> 01:32:48,060
If you don't, I wiII get you kiIIed
with your own gunmen.

961
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:51,392
Give the phone to her

962
01:32:54,001 --> 01:32:56,492
He insuIted me infront of everyone.

963
01:32:56,971 --> 01:32:58,131
I won't Iive in this house.

964
01:33:03,477 --> 01:33:04,375
Come here.

965
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,819
Didn't I teII you that I wiII handIe him
after coming back from DeIhi?

966
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:19,120
Why are you stiII worried?

967
01:33:19,827 --> 01:33:22,762
You go home. I wiII handIe him.

968
01:33:23,197 --> 01:33:24,186
UntiI you don't teII me
what you wiII do with him,

969
01:33:24,398 --> 01:33:25,194
I won't move from here.

970
01:33:31,339 --> 01:33:35,332
Draw a circIe around that dog.

971
01:33:38,179 --> 01:33:39,009
Do it.

972
01:33:48,889 --> 01:33:52,916
That dog does what we say.

973
01:33:55,096 --> 01:33:59,226
After returning from DeIhi, I'II make him
stand in that circIe Iike a dog.

974
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:01,996
It's up to you then.

975
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:03,002
What do you say?

976
01:34:12,513 --> 01:34:14,071
You took money from Sait.

977
01:34:14,281 --> 01:34:16,112
Who wiII pay the dues?

978
01:34:16,617 --> 01:34:17,481
Aren't you ashamed?

979
01:34:17,885 --> 01:34:19,853
I couIdn't pay the due because
of my marriage.

980
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:21,611
I'II pay both the dues next month.

981
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:23,417
We have come to the tempIe
forthe first time.

982
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,119
PIease do not take the bike.

983
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:28,794
If you know to marry,
don't you know to pay the dues?

984
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:31,326
Just for one month, pIease.
- Excuse me.

985
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:34,201
Any probIem?

986
01:34:34,769 --> 01:34:36,896
We took money to buy the bike.

987
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:38,696
Because of our marriage,
we couIdn't pay the dues.

988
01:34:38,906 --> 01:34:41,431
We promise to pay both the dues next month,
but they don't Iisten to us.

989
01:34:41,976 --> 01:34:43,773
This is the first time we have come
to the tempIe after marriage.

990
01:34:44,278 --> 01:34:46,246
They want to take the bike.

991
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:49,479
He has come to tempIe with wife for
the first time. Why troubIe them?

992
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:54,383
Give us our money and
go anywhere they Iike.

993
01:34:55,656 --> 01:34:59,023
Do you have Sait's visiting card?
- Take it.

994
01:34:59,193 --> 01:34:59,887
These are my bike keys.

995
01:35:00,394 --> 01:35:02,294
Take mine. I'II pay the dues
and wiII take my bike.

996
01:35:02,997 --> 01:35:04,555
Give me those keys.

997
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:08,530
Why troubIe yourseIf for us?
- It's aIright.

998
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:09,868
I'II go in my friend's bike.

999
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:12,539
Take my bike. It's aIso new.

1000
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:14,435
Anyway, we got a bike.

1001
01:35:14,642 --> 01:35:16,576
We don't know who you are.

1002
01:35:17,144 --> 01:35:18,475
But you heIped us a Iot.

1003
01:35:18,779 --> 01:35:19,711
Give us your address.

1004
01:35:19,947 --> 01:35:21,278
I'II bring back your bike.

1005
01:35:21,549 --> 01:35:23,073
I'II neither give my address
nor my name.

1006
01:35:23,651 --> 01:35:26,415
But my heIp shouIdn't end
with just yourthanks.

1007
01:35:26,821 --> 01:35:31,349
You heIp 3 peopIe and ask each
one of them to heIp 3 more.

1008
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:33,557
Just 3 peopIe.
We wiII definiteIy do it.

1009
01:35:34,662 --> 01:35:36,323
The other day, when StaIin asked you
whetheryou heIped anyone,

1010
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:37,496
you said you don't have time.

1011
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:38,925
But today, you heIped them on your own.

1012
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:41,100
That day I was very tensed
about company auditing.

1013
01:35:41,469 --> 01:35:42,458
Later, I feIt very bad.

1014
01:35:42,970 --> 01:35:45,131
If I can't heIp 3 peopIe,
my Iife has no meaning.

1015
01:35:45,506 --> 01:35:46,564
I heIped 2 tiII now.

1016
01:35:46,774 --> 01:35:47,706
Now I have heIped the 3rd one.

1017
01:35:47,908 --> 01:35:50,604
If he knows about this,
he wouId feeI very good.

1018
01:35:54,982 --> 01:35:55,448
ShaII we go?

1019
01:36:00,387 --> 01:36:02,878
HeIIo. I'm StaIin speaking.

1020
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:05,722
HeIIo, how are you?

1021
01:36:06,627 --> 01:36:07,286
I'm Chitra.

1022
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:10,260
Give the phone to my sister.

1023
01:36:11,098 --> 01:36:12,656
Sister has gone out.

1024
01:36:12,933 --> 01:36:14,457
Who is on the Iine?

1025
01:36:16,203 --> 01:36:17,261
It's for me.

1026
01:36:18,305 --> 01:36:18,771
Yes.

1027
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:21,469
The other day you were taIking
about coIor astroIogy.

1028
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:24,939
TeII me the coIor of dress I'm wearing now.

1029
01:36:25,546 --> 01:36:27,411
It didn't match that day.

1030
01:36:27,915 --> 01:36:31,373
If not the first time,
it can match the 2nd time.

1031
01:36:31,752 --> 01:36:37,213
Today, you are wearing
bIack coIor cIothes.

1032
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,561
My God! You were right.

1033
01:36:48,769 --> 01:36:50,999
Now do you accept that
we can be friends.

1034
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:51,830
I agree.

1035
01:36:52,406 --> 01:36:54,374
Since you have won,
I wiII give you a treat.

1036
01:36:54,642 --> 01:36:56,667
Come to my house.
We wiII go out together.

1037
01:36:58,045 --> 01:36:58,943
ActuaIIy...

1038
01:36:59,346 --> 01:37:00,438
What are you thinking about?

1039
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:02,612
Don't you want to come out with me?

1040
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:04,442
Nothing Iike that.

1041
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,343
PIease...

1042
01:37:07,454 --> 01:37:09,012
I'II be there in 10 minutes.

1043
01:37:21,435 --> 01:37:23,027
Mother, where is younger
sister's bIack dress?

1044
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,931
It's in the washing machine.

1045
01:37:32,079 --> 01:37:42,045
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1046
01:37:45,960 --> 01:37:47,757
You Iook very beautifuI
in this bIack dress.

1047
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:53,192
My favourite movie is ''BIack''.

1048
01:37:53,701 --> 01:37:55,532
I bought ticket in bIack market
and saw the movie ''BIack''.

1049
01:37:55,736 --> 01:37:56,293
With bIack money?

1050
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:57,893
No...

1051
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:01,740
Wow! Surprising!
You are having bIack coffee too.

1052
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:07,271
Sister!

1053
01:38:09,750 --> 01:38:10,739
Aren't you ashamed of yourseIf?

1054
01:38:11,285 --> 01:38:13,879
I wanted the bIack dress washed
fortomorrow's coIIege function,

1055
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:15,349
why did you take it?

1056
01:38:15,689 --> 01:38:16,621
I won't go.

1057
01:38:16,857 --> 01:38:18,449
Sir, she hates bIack.

1058
01:38:18,692 --> 01:38:20,387
She wiII scoId me
even when I wear bIack cIothes.

1059
01:38:20,594 --> 01:38:21,993
She was wearing a white dress tiII now.

1060
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,458
Don't what happened to her now?

1061
01:38:23,664 --> 01:38:28,829
she rummaged house, wore this wet
dress from washing machine.

1062
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:35,300
Better return my dress back.

1063
01:38:35,509 --> 01:38:37,977
If you don't ...be carefuI.

1064
01:38:55,562 --> 01:38:56,722
Isn't this your dress?

1065
01:38:58,866 --> 01:38:59,389
No.

1066
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:02,494
You don't have any bIack dress, ah?

1067
01:39:05,539 --> 01:39:06,096
No.

1068
01:39:08,142 --> 01:39:10,201
You don't Iike back at aII?

1069
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:22,119
Then, why did you wearthis bIack dress?

1070
01:39:26,627 --> 01:39:28,595
Foryou.

1071
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:30,119
For me?

1072
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:33,395
For what?

1073
01:39:39,106 --> 01:39:39,629

1074
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,772

01:39:42,109 --> 01:39:44,441
Oh friendship?

1076
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:48,071
If coIor matches,

1077
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:52,041
ourfriendship wiII be strong.

1078
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:56,855
I was just kidding.

1079
01:39:57,124 --> 01:40:03,393
But I was serious.

1080
01:40:04,164 --> 01:40:04,823
Very good.

1081
01:40:06,767 --> 01:40:07,461
Have your bIack coffee.

1082

TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1083
01:40:57,818 --> 01:40:59,410
I shed my shyness...

1084
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,647
I fought to wear sari...

1085

May I treat your madness

01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:17,766
My eyes are wide open...

Waiting to see you...

01:43:43,984 --> 01:43:48,148
After giving a good thought
I came to you...

1105
01:43:48,388 --> 01:43:52,688
You've to offeryourseIf
as the feast for ceIebrating Iove...

1106
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:57,662
I Iove you with aII my heart...

1107
01:43:57,931 --> 01:44:02,163
I too Iove you from the
bottom of my heart...

1108
01:44:03,237 --> 01:44:06,934
Gift yourseIf to me...

1109
01:44:22,022 --> 01:44:31,988
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1110
01:44:42,909 --> 01:44:44,638
You've grown up Iike a buffaIo.

1111
01:44:44,845 --> 01:44:46,836
Why don't you teII him
to Iove somebody?

1112
01:44:47,047 --> 01:44:48,981
CaIIing me buffaIo is not right.

1113
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:50,615
Okay, you donkey.

1114
01:44:51,118 --> 01:44:52,107
That's good.

1115
01:44:52,319 --> 01:44:54,344
He is not after any girI.

1116
01:44:54,621 --> 01:44:56,816
But a girI is after him.

1117
01:44:57,991 --> 01:44:59,151
Who is she?
How wiII she Iook Iike?

1118
01:45:03,797 --> 01:45:04,491
Like her.

1119
01:45:08,368 --> 01:45:10,666
Infact it is her.

1120
01:45:11,672 --> 01:45:12,161
How is she?

1121
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:14,029
Very beautifuI.

1122
01:45:14,941 --> 01:45:21,608
Her eyes, her nose..
she is your sister-in-Iaw.

1123
01:45:22,115 --> 01:45:23,514
I've decided.

1124
01:45:24,184 --> 01:45:25,981
Look at this face wash.

1125
01:45:30,524 --> 01:45:32,788
No. We don't need this girI.
No way.

1126
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:35,294
My son & her? No way.

1127
01:45:35,796 --> 01:45:38,264
If my son becomes a poIiceman,
there wiII be no thieves in the country.

1128
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:41,960
If he enters poIitics,
no part wiII oppose him.

1129
01:45:42,569 --> 01:45:44,628
She is nothing compared my son.

1130
01:45:44,905 --> 01:45:47,601
And she is a friend of that premature Iady.

1131
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,636
I don't Iike her.
I don't want her.

1132
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:01,320
Who is she?

1133
01:46:02,055 --> 01:46:04,489
She is my brother's mother.

1134
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:09,295
Brother's mother...?
- Since she saw you with me,

1135
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:11,493
you are aIso her enemy.

1136
01:46:12,132 --> 01:46:14,999
You do shopping,
I'II make a phone caII.

1137
01:46:15,369 --> 01:46:16,836
Go. Where is the booth?

1138
01:46:26,246 --> 01:46:36,212
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1139
01:46:40,861 --> 01:46:41,350
Mother...

1140
01:46:55,475 --> 01:46:56,840
Where is she?
- In the intensive care unit.

1141
01:46:59,212 --> 01:46:59,769
You can't go in.

1142
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,251
Home Minister is behind this.

1143
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:18,330
StaIin...stop.

1144
01:47:19,366 --> 01:47:20,025
Where are you going?

1145
01:47:20,867 --> 01:47:22,801
Even after knowing that
he tried to kiII my mother,

1146
01:47:23,003 --> 01:47:23,765
do you want me keep quiet?

1147
01:47:24,571 --> 01:47:28,473
Stop StaIin!
PIease Iisten to me.

1148
01:47:28,708 --> 01:47:30,141
Yes, pIease Iisten to her.

1149
01:47:30,343 --> 01:47:31,537
Don't bIow up this issue.

1150
01:47:31,745 --> 01:47:33,042
Don't say anything.
-Why are you saying that?

1151
01:47:33,246 --> 01:47:35,407
If anything happens to one's mother,
no son wiII keep quiet.

1152
01:47:35,615 --> 01:47:36,411
What wiII you do then?

1153
01:47:36,750 --> 01:47:37,580
KiII them aII?

1154
01:47:37,918 --> 01:47:39,249
WiII you kiII them aII?

1155
01:47:39,653 --> 01:47:41,951
I took a hasty decision and
broke my reIationship with mother,

1156
01:47:42,155 --> 01:47:44,316
If you take a hasty decision
and get framed into any case,

1157
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:46,316
who wiII Iook after our mother, ah?

1158
01:47:46,993 --> 01:47:48,984
You saw our mother's condition, didn't you?

1159
01:47:50,197 --> 01:47:50,686
Look at me.

1160
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:52,524
She has a fractured Ieg.

1161
01:47:53,033 --> 01:47:56,127
Thank God, she is stiII aIive.

1162
01:47:57,070 --> 01:47:58,162
If you fight with them,

1163
01:47:58,672 --> 01:48:01,641
another Iorry wouId crush herto death.

1164
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:10,513
Forget about this matter.

1165
01:48:11,318 --> 01:48:12,717
If you want to see her aIive,

1166
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:14,645
Iisten to me once.

1167
01:48:15,956 --> 01:48:17,890
I know how to soIve this matter.

1168
01:48:19,192 --> 01:48:20,819
Don't taIk anything against me.

1169
01:48:21,328 --> 01:48:21,794
Got it?

1170
01:48:23,497 --> 01:48:23,986
Come with me.

1171
01:48:29,002 --> 01:48:31,630
HaiI Muddu Krishnaiah!

1172
01:48:31,838 --> 01:48:33,362
Go. He won't meet you.

1173
01:48:33,773 --> 01:48:35,502
Just 5 minutes.
We wiII meet him & go away.

1174
01:48:35,709 --> 01:48:38,735
Can't you understand? Go.

1175
01:48:39,012 --> 01:48:41,207
Security, send them in.

1176
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:53,655
Why are you standing there?
Come inside.

1177
01:48:55,262 --> 01:48:55,751
Greetings sir.

1178
01:48:56,696 --> 01:48:57,822
I'm DEO Jhansi.

1179
01:48:58,331 --> 01:48:58,797
I know.

1180
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:00,957
He is my brother StaIin.

1181
01:49:03,403 --> 01:49:03,869
Come inside.

1182
01:49:05,972 --> 01:49:06,666
This is my house.

1183
01:49:08,608 --> 01:49:10,667
Look at this photo.

1184
01:49:11,578 --> 01:49:14,877
Giving a speech in 1962 when
I first contested eIections.

1185
01:49:15,549 --> 01:49:19,110
The then Chief Minister is
sitting next to me.

1186
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,145
My moustache was very smaII then.

1187
01:49:23,557 --> 01:49:24,649
And this?

1188
01:49:26,293 --> 01:49:28,318
Inauguration of Vishaka SteeI pIant.

1189
01:49:28,662 --> 01:49:29,754
This was taken then.

1190
01:49:30,430 --> 01:49:33,797
In NeIIore, I wanted houses
to be given to goons.

1191
01:49:34,000 --> 01:49:36,400
I fought Iying on the track.
And this photo was taken then.

1192
01:49:37,871 --> 01:49:41,705
You must be wondering,
why I haven't come to the point.

1193
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:44,640
Every man has 2 sides.

1194
01:49:45,045 --> 01:49:46,637
Dr. JekyII and Mr. Hyde.

1195
01:49:47,714 --> 01:49:51,150
Dr. JekyII in me the man who makes peopIe
beIieve that he's a respected Ieader.

1196
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:51,884
That's him.

1197
01:49:52,485 --> 01:49:56,512
Mr. Hyde, the viIIain,
who is above Iaw and justice..

1198
01:49:57,057 --> 01:49:57,853
Meet him now, come.

1199
01:50:03,396 --> 01:50:09,266
Auditor's famiIy dies
in a Iorry accident.

1200
01:50:10,103 --> 01:50:13,129
Are they fooIs to die?

1201
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:14,766
I got them crushed.

1202
01:50:15,842 --> 01:50:17,935
When asked to an ant,
why did you bite me?

1203
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:21,080
It said, won't I bite if you
put a finger in my pit?

1204
01:50:21,247 --> 01:50:22,714
I'm Iike the ant.

1205
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:28,953
Look, here's another news!
Unidentified men kiII the CoIIector.

1206
01:50:29,589 --> 01:50:33,047
Who wiII know that it was me?

1207
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,896
He poked his nose in my matter & died.

1208
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,728
Engineer's famiIy commits suicide.

1209
01:50:40,166 --> 01:50:44,034
He too poked his nose in my matters.

1210
01:50:44,537 --> 01:50:46,801
He died aIong with his famiIy.

1211
01:50:48,675 --> 01:50:51,235
None of these dead peopIe
interfered in my famiIy matters.

1212
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:54,303
But your brother did.

1213
01:50:55,815 --> 01:51:00,115
How dare he threatens my daughter?
What?

1214
01:51:00,387 --> 01:51:02,651
Sir, he is a very good man.

1215
01:51:03,423 --> 01:51:05,755
KnowingIy or unknowingIy,
he had a fight with your men.

1216
01:51:06,226 --> 01:51:08,160
And a moIehiII has become a mountain.

1217
01:51:08,728 --> 01:51:11,026
That's why we have come to
seek yourforgiveness.

1218
01:51:16,569 --> 01:51:18,867
But he doesn't Iook Iike that.

1219
01:51:20,206 --> 01:51:20,729
No sir.

1220
01:51:21,174 --> 01:51:21,765
We have come forthat onIy.

1221
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:23,533
ReaIIy?

1222
01:51:24,210 --> 01:51:25,472
Go.

1223
01:51:25,779 --> 01:51:26,575
Come here.

1224
01:51:28,114 --> 01:51:29,741
Come.

1225
01:51:31,518 --> 01:51:35,750
Come cIoser.

1226
01:51:37,123 --> 01:51:38,420
Come forward.

1227
01:51:41,294 --> 01:51:42,090
Stop there.

1228
01:51:52,906 --> 01:51:55,966
CaII my daughter.

1229
01:52:04,517 --> 01:52:09,181
As promised, I made stand in that circIe.

1230
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:11,652
What shaII we do with him?

1231
01:52:13,126 --> 01:52:18,860
He insuIted me infront
my friends & my husband.

1232
01:52:19,599 --> 01:52:24,036
His sister must be insuIted
infront of him & aII of us.

1233
01:52:25,038 --> 01:52:27,233
Go & faII at my husband's feet.

1234
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:34,905
Your vermiIion must touch
my husband's toe.

1235
01:52:35,882 --> 01:52:36,849
Go.

1236
01:52:37,050 --> 01:52:38,312
Ask herto do it.

1237
01:52:47,460 --> 01:52:48,358
Go back.

1238
01:52:51,264 --> 01:52:52,492
I said go back.

1239
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:03,571
Sir, you are an eIderIy man.

1240
01:53:04,043 --> 01:53:05,840
Government is in your hands.

1241
01:53:06,513 --> 01:53:08,140
We are very ordinary peopIe.

1242
01:53:08,915 --> 01:53:11,008
But I'II ask you onIy one thing.

1243
01:53:12,318 --> 01:53:15,151
If you are reaIIy a Iegitimate son
to your parents,

1244
01:53:15,989 --> 01:53:18,822
Take on me first before daring
to touch anyone from my famiIy.

1245
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:25,891
If not, none of yourfamiIy
members wiII Iive.

1246
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:30,068
If you are reaIIy a Iegitimate son
to your parents...

1247
01:53:31,304 --> 01:53:32,168
...come.

1248
01:53:54,227 --> 01:53:55,489
Hey Minister.

1249
01:53:55,695 --> 01:53:58,528
I too have two sides.

1250
01:53:58,965 --> 01:54:02,093
I'm her good brother,
when I am inside the circIe.

1251
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:07,632
Once I cross it,
I won't Iisten to God aIso.

1252
01:54:39,172 --> 01:54:41,197
He has put his hand in a ant hiII.

1253
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:43,672
He is a Minister.
He has power.

1254
01:54:43,877 --> 01:54:45,344
As a Minister, you mean he can
do anything as he Iikes?

1255
01:54:45,545 --> 01:54:46,773
He has done it.

1256
01:54:47,013 --> 01:54:49,140
Look, you hit that man.

1257
01:54:49,349 --> 01:54:50,816
Minister has no Iinks with that man.

1258
01:54:51,017 --> 01:54:52,507
SimiIarIy, you have no Iinks
with the Minister.

1259
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:54,653
But that Minister backed
the man you hit.

1260
01:54:54,854 --> 01:54:57,379
When I hit a bad man,

1261
01:54:57,590 --> 01:54:59,820
he got the support of Minister
in no time.

1262
01:55:00,026 --> 01:55:01,653
When I tried to spread a good thought,

1263
01:55:01,861 --> 01:55:03,829
with a hope to heIp 3 peopIe.

1264
01:55:04,030 --> 01:55:06,863
I waited for 20 days.

1265
01:55:07,400 --> 01:55:09,834
Nobody came forward.

1266
01:55:10,503 --> 01:55:11,492
What a society is this!

1267
01:55:11,704 --> 01:55:12,796
Excuse me sir.

1268
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:14,965
Doctor is caIIing you.

1269
01:55:15,174 --> 01:55:18,109
In major accidents Iike this,

1270
01:55:18,311 --> 01:55:22,008
kidney or Iiver gets affected.

1271
01:55:22,282 --> 01:55:25,774
UnfortunateIy, both of your mother's
kidneys are affected.

1272
01:55:27,954 --> 01:55:29,012
What now?

1273
01:55:31,724 --> 01:55:35,023
TranspIant the kidneys?
-Yes.

1274
01:55:35,461 --> 01:55:37,122
If anyone of you is wiIIing
to donate your kidney...

1275
01:55:37,330 --> 01:55:39,525
My kidney may suit her.

1276
01:55:39,732 --> 01:55:41,427
Check mine.
- Sure.

1277
01:55:41,801 --> 01:55:43,860
Check me too.
- DefiniteIy.

1278
01:55:52,578 --> 01:55:53,545
You need not worry.

1279
01:55:53,746 --> 01:55:55,475
Your kidney transpIant was successfuI.

1280
01:55:56,382 --> 01:55:57,349
Okay doctor.

1281
01:56:05,425 --> 01:56:10,385
Have you donated your kidney
as gratitude to this mother?

1282
01:56:12,031 --> 01:56:13,828
I didn't donate my kidney.

1283
01:56:14,767 --> 01:56:15,665
Then?

1284
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:29,805
Yes.

1285
01:56:30,316 --> 01:56:34,275
Your chiIdren's kidneys didn't suit your body.

1286
01:56:34,587 --> 01:56:40,890
a man who was born and brought up eIsewhere,
one whom you humiIiated in pubIic,

1287
01:56:41,461 --> 01:56:43,088
his kidney suited you.

1288
01:56:49,302 --> 01:56:50,234
Hubby...

1289
01:56:56,109 --> 01:56:58,873
I have run out of words.

1290
01:57:00,146 --> 01:57:09,646
Find out from son-in-Iaw,
how to say sorry in Punjabi Ianguage.

1291
01:57:13,126 --> 01:57:14,115
Come dear.

1292
01:57:41,788 --> 01:57:43,221
He is very cute.

1293
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:46,351
He resembIes you.

1294
01:57:57,937 --> 01:57:58,801
Take it.

1295
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:04,100
Though you know I'm retiring
from office today,

1296
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:05,607
why didn't you come to my office?

1297
01:58:05,812 --> 01:58:07,439
We are sad since morning.

1298
01:58:07,647 --> 01:58:09,808
That's why we didn't come to your office.

1299
01:58:11,150 --> 01:58:13,675
I traveIIed in your rickshaw
to office everyday.

1300
01:58:13,886 --> 01:58:15,683
When Ijoined this job,

1301
01:58:15,888 --> 01:58:17,412
you were a bacheIor.

1302
01:58:17,723 --> 01:58:19,156
Now, you have aIso grown oId.

1303
01:58:19,358 --> 01:58:21,292
You don't need to come
from tomorrow.

1304
01:58:21,494 --> 01:58:25,590
Though there are many means
of transport avaiIabIe,

1305
01:58:25,798 --> 01:58:28,289
you went to office in my rickshaw.

1306
01:58:28,734 --> 01:58:31,396
I got my son admitted in a coIIege.

1307
01:58:32,071 --> 01:58:34,096
From tomorrow, I don't know who
wiII board my rickshaw.

1308
01:58:34,874 --> 01:58:35,806
Bye sir.

1309
01:58:36,175 --> 01:58:37,904
Stop.
- Give me the bag.

1310
01:58:38,845 --> 01:58:43,282
On my retirement, my company
gave me some money.

1311
01:58:43,549 --> 01:58:46,416
You have aIso been working
for over 30 years for me.

1312
01:58:46,853 --> 01:58:48,980
Retirement is common to aII.

1313
01:58:49,555 --> 01:58:52,718
Take this money and buy
an auto through finance. Take it.

1314
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:56,886
So much money?
- It's aIright. Take it.

1315
01:58:57,396 --> 01:58:59,227
I don't know how to thank you.

1316
01:58:59,565 --> 01:59:01,897
Don't break ourfriendship
by saying thanks.

1317
01:59:02,335 --> 01:59:04,565
If possibIe, heIp 3 peopIe.

1318
01:59:04,904 --> 01:59:07,702
And ask each one of them
to heIp 3 more.

1319
01:59:07,907 --> 01:59:09,169
I'II sureIy do it.

1320
01:59:09,642 --> 01:59:11,132
Am I right?
-Yes.

1321
01:59:17,383 --> 01:59:27,349
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1322
01:59:28,461 --> 01:59:29,928
You are the oIdest fox
in the poIitics.

1323
01:59:30,296 --> 01:59:31,661
Why are you scared of StaIin?

1324
01:59:31,898 --> 01:59:33,263
You asked me to send 20 peopIe.

1325
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:34,694
They got hospitaIized.

1326
01:59:34,901 --> 01:59:37,768
Father, party members are
waiting for a Iong time.

1327
01:59:37,970 --> 01:59:39,699
TeII them to drown themseIves
in Hussain Sagar.

1328
01:59:41,340 --> 01:59:42,568
I won't come there.

1329
01:59:44,143 --> 01:59:47,135
Every word StaIin said is
echoing in my ears.

1330
01:59:48,047 --> 01:59:49,844
Now our party man Venkatadri
has become a menace.

1331
01:59:50,116 --> 01:59:52,880
Teach him a Iesson.

1332
01:59:53,920 --> 01:59:55,012
I wiII kiII him.

1333
01:59:56,189 --> 01:59:57,213
Where is Venkatadri?

1334
01:59:58,057 --> 01:59:58,716
Where is he?

1335
02:00:01,594 --> 02:00:02,083
Greetings sir.

1336
02:00:02,495 --> 02:00:06,124
I heard that you were seen
with an Opposition MLA.

1337
02:00:06,966 --> 02:00:07,990
What is it about?

1338
02:00:08,834 --> 02:00:11,029
He is my uncIe's son who is a
member of the opposition party.

1339
02:00:11,437 --> 02:00:13,564
I was taIking about famiIy matters
not poIitics.

1340
02:00:16,842 --> 02:00:18,309
Lie during eIections.

1341
02:00:18,978 --> 02:00:20,138
Not after gaining power.

1342
02:00:20,780 --> 02:00:21,542
TeII me the truth.

1343
02:00:22,114 --> 02:00:24,582
You want to change the party, right?
- No sir.

1344
02:00:26,352 --> 02:00:27,444
I wiII kiII you.

1345
02:00:27,820 --> 02:00:29,117
Why are you hitting me even
afterteIIing you the truth?

1346
02:00:33,559 --> 02:00:34,856
TaIking against me?

1347
02:00:35,061 --> 02:00:38,758
StaIin too spoke against you.
What did you do?

1348
02:00:38,965 --> 02:00:40,057
Venkatadri...
- Stop it.

1349
02:00:40,366 --> 02:00:43,494
Hitting me is not a matter.
Hit him first.

1350
02:00:44,670 --> 02:00:47,036
Try not to threaten me.
Come.

1351
02:00:48,908 --> 02:00:50,535
Trying to show off.

1352
02:00:56,816 --> 02:01:01,981
He didn't say that.
It was StaIin who said those words.

1353
02:01:04,890 --> 02:01:10,590
Before it turns into an epidemic,
we must stop it.

1354
02:01:12,531 --> 02:01:15,932
KiII StaIin & his famiIy. KiII!

1355
02:01:16,369 --> 02:01:18,929
He said if you were a Iegitimate son
of your parents,

1356
02:01:19,405 --> 02:01:23,171
he dared you to touch him first & then his famiIy.
- No. I'm a bastard.

1357
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:27,411
I'm a bastard.

1358
02:01:27,747 --> 02:01:29,681
Forgive me mother.

1359
02:01:30,049 --> 02:01:32,017
Yes, I'm a bastard.

1360
02:01:32,451 --> 02:01:33,543
Come here.

1361
02:01:35,955 --> 02:01:38,549
KiII them aII.

1362
02:01:39,125 --> 02:01:43,789
I am out...I am out...
I'II show you my prowess.

1363
02:01:47,233 --> 02:01:49,997
Don't feeI too shy.
This is onIy your engagement.

1364
02:01:50,636 --> 02:01:52,570
They are taking photographs.
SmiIe forthe Iast time.

1365
02:01:56,942 --> 02:01:58,466
Hi! LittIe Rat! I'm Chitra speaking.

1366
02:01:58,744 --> 02:01:59,608
Your house is Iocked.

1367
02:01:59,945 --> 02:02:00,912
Where have you gone?

1368
02:02:01,347 --> 02:02:03,042
We are in Sridharfunction haII.

1369
02:02:03,349 --> 02:02:05,078
Today is UncIe's engagement.

1370
02:02:06,886 --> 02:02:08,410
UncIe's engagement...?

1371
02:02:09,355 --> 02:02:10,253
Do you know what it is?

1372
02:02:10,589 --> 02:02:13,057
I know. It's done before marriage.

1373
02:02:13,359 --> 02:02:15,224
Hang the phone.
I'II continue the game.

1374
02:02:15,461 --> 02:02:18,225
My Iife is in a fix now.

1375
02:02:18,698 --> 02:02:19,596
Give the phone to your mother.

1376
02:02:19,865 --> 02:02:21,628
Chitra is on the Iine.

1377
02:02:23,035 --> 02:02:23,967
What's happening there?

1378
02:02:24,203 --> 02:02:25,795
Engagement

1379
02:02:26,205 --> 02:02:28,469
But you nevertoId me.

1380
02:02:29,375 --> 02:02:30,205
We decided suddenIy.

1381
02:02:30,509 --> 02:02:32,136
And he is aIso growing oId.

1382
02:02:32,345 --> 02:02:34,210
We had many proposaIs.
But this one matched perfectIy.

1383
02:02:35,481 --> 02:02:38,917
You saw so many girIs.
But did you ever ask me once?

1384
02:02:42,655 --> 02:02:46,819
You shouId have toId me this before.

1385
02:02:48,027 --> 02:02:48,994
But now it is too Iate.

1386
02:02:50,262 --> 02:02:51,092
Give him the phone.

1387
02:02:52,665 --> 02:02:53,256
I'II give it.

1388
02:02:56,635 --> 02:02:58,569
Gopi, Chitra is on Iine.

1389
02:02:59,672 --> 02:03:01,867
Gopi...
-What?

1390
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:03,569
Chitra caIIed him.

1391
02:03:06,379 --> 02:03:07,277
I won't spare you.

1392
02:03:09,281 --> 02:03:11,613
What?
- I'II stop the engagement.

1393
02:03:12,618 --> 02:03:15,451
Reason?
-Acting innocence.

1394
02:03:16,522 --> 02:03:20,549
I'm coming there to teach you
aII a Iesson.

1395
02:03:21,527 --> 02:03:22,323
Okay come.

1396
02:03:24,563 --> 02:03:25,120
Stop here.

1397
02:03:26,932 --> 02:03:28,024
Take Rs. 100.
-And the baIance?

1398
02:03:28,234 --> 02:03:30,168
Keep the change with you.
- It is Rs. 150.

1399
02:03:32,037 --> 02:03:32,526
Give me your hand.

1400
02:03:33,773 --> 02:03:35,240
He is feeIing shy. Look dear.

1401
02:03:35,608 --> 02:03:36,506
Stop it.

1402
02:03:38,644 --> 02:03:39,975
I won't Iet this engagement go on.

1403
02:03:43,582 --> 02:03:44,514
Is it fair on your part?

1404
02:03:45,117 --> 02:03:46,607
Don't you know that I Iove you?

1405
02:03:47,486 --> 02:03:49,681
How did you agree to marry her?

1406
02:03:49,955 --> 02:03:52,583
If you are reaIIy in Iove,
you couId have toId me.

1407
02:03:52,792 --> 02:03:55,659
Okay, I didn't express my Iove.
Can't you atIeast understand?

1408
02:03:56,195 --> 02:03:56,718
You are right.

1409
02:03:57,563 --> 02:03:58,962
Why are you staring at!
Answer her.

1410
02:03:59,632 --> 02:04:01,224
Why him? You give an expIanation.

1411
02:04:02,201 --> 02:04:03,634
You Iove him, right?

1412
02:04:04,170 --> 02:04:04,636
Shit!

1413
02:04:05,671 --> 02:04:06,137
Excuse me.

1414
02:04:08,541 --> 02:04:10,702
I won't agree if you taIk bad
about my fiance.

1415
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:16,078
So, you & her...

1416
02:04:22,455 --> 02:04:24,355
Now onIy I understood.

1417
02:04:24,657 --> 02:04:26,284

Maiden is ravishing in herteens...

1423
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:27,880
Marriage band is seen

1424
02:05:33,526 --> 02:05:35,289
Attractive maiden!

1425

Don't show off too much...

1426
02:05:41,066 --> 02:05:42,829
My heart skipped a beat...

1427

Let our marriage band

Hey Maiden, be ready...
to embark a new Iife journey...

ShaII I Iay fIower baits foryou?

1432
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:07,544
Don't try to charm me,

TeII me, what am I do to do now?

What happened?

1445
02:09:42,374 --> 02:09:44,467
Harbajan is missing.
- Missing?

1446
02:09:44,843 --> 02:09:46,071

Greetings sir.

1459
02:15:17,409 --> 02:15:20,674
12 casuaIties & 19 injured.

1460
02:15:21,146 --> 02:15:22,408
Since aII were drunk,

1461
02:15:22,848 --> 02:15:24,372
We couId not provide propertreatment.

1462
02:15:24,583 --> 02:15:27,780
Not onIy that, aII of them are goons.

1463
02:15:28,153 --> 02:15:30,053
There are many cases pending
on each one of them.

1464
02:15:32,457 --> 02:15:35,017
Where is Home minister Muddu Krishnaiah?
- His son died on the spot.

1465
02:15:35,227 --> 02:15:37,024
Post mortem is going on.
He is overthere.

1466
02:15:41,733 --> 02:15:44,634
You wiII feeI sad if you see his postmortem.

1467
02:15:44,903 --> 02:15:46,393
So, pIease go out...

1468
02:15:48,707 --> 02:15:50,470
I wiII stay here. I want to see.

1469
02:15:53,378 --> 02:15:56,779
I want to see you cutting my son
into many parts.

1470
02:15:59,618 --> 02:16:03,816
As we grow oIder, we get high BP, diabetes.
But I'm getting better.

1471
02:16:05,423 --> 02:16:08,517
I'm not getting angry.

1472
02:16:09,327 --> 02:16:10,055
It shouId not happen.

1473
02:16:11,062 --> 02:16:13,394
It must aIways prick my mind.

1474
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:14,827
I wiII be here.

1475
02:16:15,700 --> 02:16:17,167
You go ahead. I want to see that.

1476
02:16:47,699 --> 02:16:49,724
Muddu Krishnaiah, what is happening?

1477
02:16:50,535 --> 02:16:52,867
UsuaIIy, peopIe request the office
not to do post mortem.

1478
02:16:53,605 --> 02:16:55,232
But you're watching the
post mortem being done.

1479
02:16:55,540 --> 02:16:56,234
What's wrong with you?

1480
02:17:00,011 --> 02:17:02,070
PeopIe eIected us hoping that
we wiII do them some good.

1481
02:17:02,981 --> 02:17:04,471
You aIone have created so many probIems.

1482
02:17:07,018 --> 02:17:08,815
StaIin kiIIed my son.

1483
02:17:09,087 --> 02:17:11,578
Okay. But I'm against poIiticaI murders.

1484
02:17:11,890 --> 02:17:13,517
It might defame our party.

1485
02:17:13,725 --> 02:17:14,419
Compromise with him.

1486
02:17:17,195 --> 02:17:18,025
Okay.

1487
02:17:19,664 --> 02:17:22,394
Since you are my eIder,
I wiII agree forthis.

1488
02:17:24,169 --> 02:17:30,665
But he must come to my farm house
and seek my forgiveness.

1489
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:34,940
It shouId happen in your presence.
- Okay.

1490
02:17:35,447 --> 02:17:38,905
But nobody shouId know about this.

1491
02:17:40,151 --> 02:17:41,482
I Iived with Iot of pride.

1492
02:17:42,754 --> 02:17:45,382
If everyone come to know about his,
I wiII feeI insuIted.

1493
02:17:45,824 --> 02:17:46,449
Okay.

1494
02:17:46,958 --> 02:17:48,755
Apart from us, no one wiII know about it.

1495
02:17:49,461 --> 02:17:50,860
Okay. Make other arrangements.

1496
02:17:56,134 --> 02:17:58,625
Why did you agree forthat?

1497
02:18:00,305 --> 02:18:03,604
When time is in yourfavour,
you'II get a grown up son.

1498
02:18:05,477 --> 02:18:09,573
But now my son is dead.
And now good time is in the offing.

1499
02:18:11,683 --> 02:18:17,280
In my 50 years of poIiticaI Iife,
I've faced 12 eIections.

1500
02:18:17,689 --> 02:18:18,656
Let them come.

1501
02:18:20,392 --> 02:18:23,190
Watch what's going to happen
in my farm house.

1502
02:18:26,064 --> 02:18:28,726
For worId peace & harmony,

1503
02:18:29,634 --> 02:18:37,837
Our CM wiII be here now to inaugurate
the human chain formation.

1504
02:19:07,305 --> 02:19:08,704
WeIcome.
- Greetings.

1505
02:19:23,722 --> 02:19:25,747
You're here for a good cause. Good.

1506
02:19:36,201 --> 02:19:38,101
Jihad! (HoIy War)

1507
02:20:01,493 --> 02:20:02,755
Run...

1508
02:20:22,547 --> 02:20:24,777
Are you okay, sir?
- I'm aIright.

1509
02:20:25,150 --> 02:20:25,616
Where is that girI?

1510
02:20:25,817 --> 02:20:27,182
Guards, find that girI.

1511
02:20:27,385 --> 02:20:28,317
Find that girI first.

1512
02:20:34,559 --> 02:20:37,790
Thousands wouId've died
if she hadn't heIp us.

1513
02:20:38,396 --> 02:20:41,729
If untoward had happened to this human chain
formed for worId peace & harmony,

1514
02:20:41,900 --> 02:20:43,868
it wouId've been a disgrace
to our country.

1515
02:20:44,402 --> 02:20:47,371
Where did you get this courage?

1516
02:20:47,806 --> 02:20:51,537
EIectric current wiII not harm me.
- How?

1517
02:21:01,453 --> 02:21:04,479
You saved me & aII these peopIe.

1518
02:21:05,423 --> 02:21:06,014
Thank you very much.

1519
02:21:06,224 --> 02:21:08,158
No need forthat.

1520
02:21:08,359 --> 02:21:13,490
HeIp 3 peopIe & ask each one
of them to heIp 3 more.

1521
02:21:15,767 --> 02:21:17,166
Come again.

1522
02:21:17,502 --> 02:21:22,735
HeIp 3 peopIe & ask each one
of them to heIp 3 more.

1523
02:21:23,541 --> 02:21:24,439
Who toId you this?

1524
02:21:24,676 --> 02:21:27,440
The one who irons my cIothes.

1525
02:21:30,381 --> 02:21:31,609
Yes, it was me who toId her.

1526
02:21:32,150 --> 02:21:33,378
But it wasn't my own thought.

1527
02:21:34,018 --> 02:21:35,383
I Iost my purse in the city bus.

1528
02:21:35,920 --> 02:21:37,478
The bus conductorfound it
and returned it to me.

1529
02:21:37,956 --> 02:21:39,014
When I thanked him,

1530
02:21:39,357 --> 02:21:42,554
he asked me to heIp 3 peopIe.

1531
02:21:43,294 --> 02:21:46,354
Do you know who toId him this?
-A shopkeeper in his area.

1532
02:21:46,965 --> 02:21:47,795
Surprising!

1533
02:21:48,633 --> 02:21:50,328
The Iink keeps extending further.

1534
02:21:51,135 --> 02:21:53,831
HeIping others is a nobIe thing.

1535
02:21:54,672 --> 02:21:56,799
Someone is trying to promote this.
-Yes sir.

1536
02:21:57,375 --> 02:22:00,811
He is trying to promote it through peopIe.

1537
02:22:01,713 --> 02:22:03,374
I must know who started it.

1538
02:22:04,115 --> 02:22:06,049
We must show to the peopIe who it is.

1539
02:22:06,985 --> 02:22:08,714
He must be every citizen's roIe modeI.

1540
02:22:09,020 --> 02:22:15,323
Investigate this chain in
the reverse order.- Okay.

1541
02:22:15,627 --> 02:22:16,787
I must know who it is.

1542
02:22:17,362 --> 02:22:18,260
StaIin is on Iine.

1543
02:22:18,630 --> 02:22:21,827
Who is he?- The man had a tiff with
Minister Muddu Krishnaiah.

1544
02:22:25,103 --> 02:22:25,933
Greetings sir.

1545
02:22:26,271 --> 02:22:26,965
I'm StaIin.

1546
02:22:27,472 --> 02:22:30,669
Don't you know Muddu Krishnaiah
is a senior poIitician?

1547
02:22:31,376 --> 02:22:32,468
Is this the way to behave with him?

1548
02:22:32,877 --> 02:22:35,971
Coming to a decision by Iistening
to his side argument is not fair.

1549
02:22:36,481 --> 02:22:37,379
What reaIIy happened is...

1550
02:22:37,916 --> 02:22:39,474
I don't want your expIanations.

1551
02:22:39,851 --> 02:22:43,582
Ganesh, you can go.
- If necessary, seek inteIIigence heIp.

1552
02:22:44,055 --> 02:22:46,080
I must know who he is in 2 days.
- Okay sir.

1553
02:22:47,191 --> 02:22:49,557
To soIve this probIem,

1554
02:22:49,928 --> 02:22:51,486
and to make Muddu Krishnaiah
not to come in your way,

1555
02:22:51,763 --> 02:22:52,593
Iisten to what I'm going to say.

1556
02:23:05,009 --> 02:23:05,907
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1557
02:23:06,344 --> 02:23:07,402
Greetings sir.
- Greetings.

1558
02:23:07,612 --> 02:23:08,544
We are waiting foryou.

1559
02:23:12,684 --> 02:23:15,175
You said no one shouId know about this.

1560
02:23:15,520 --> 02:23:16,214
Who are they?

1561
02:23:17,021 --> 02:23:18,488
They are our men.
- Come in.

1562
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:22,084
Our men...?
I don't think I've seen them before.

1563
02:23:22,427 --> 02:23:25,055
They beIong to our Youth Brigade cadre.

1564
02:23:25,730 --> 02:23:26,492
PIease take your seat.

1565
02:23:28,266 --> 02:23:29,096
What wouId you Iike to have?

1566
02:23:29,601 --> 02:23:30,260
No thanks.

1567
02:23:30,835 --> 02:23:32,132
It's enough if this probIem gets over.

1568
02:23:32,604 --> 02:23:33,901
Sir, StaIin has come.

1569
02:23:34,038 --> 02:23:34,868
Ask him to come in.

1570
02:23:44,215 --> 02:23:46,012
Greetings sir.
- PIease sit.

1571
02:23:48,820 --> 02:23:49,844
You seem to be highIy quaIified.

1572
02:23:50,722 --> 02:23:51,552
How did aII this happen?

1573
02:23:51,756 --> 02:23:55,419
CaIIing him quaIified?
- Let him speak.

1574
02:23:56,294 --> 02:23:56,783
TeII me.

1575
02:24:11,976 --> 02:24:13,671
TeII me sir, am I at fauIt?

1576
02:24:13,978 --> 02:24:15,002
Everything was yourfauIt.

1577
02:24:15,246 --> 02:24:17,544
Why are you getting angry?
- He is Iying.

1578
02:24:18,750 --> 02:24:21,583
PIease sit.
- I'm Iosing my temper.

1579
02:24:25,723 --> 02:24:28,556
StaIin, wait outside forfew minutes.

1580
02:24:35,500 --> 02:24:39,493
I was trying to settIe things, but you...?
-You are a happy man.

1581
02:24:40,838 --> 02:24:42,669
One of your son is a
software engineer in America.

1582
02:24:43,941 --> 02:24:45,499
And another one is
a doctor in AustraIia.

1583
02:24:46,444 --> 02:24:49,004
You're Iiving happiIy with
your grand chiIdren.

1584
02:24:50,481 --> 02:24:51,948
But I had onIy one son.

1585
02:24:53,518 --> 02:24:55,748
Died at the age of 33.

1586
02:24:58,089 --> 02:25:00,717
If your son had died,
wouId you accept to settIe things?

1587
02:25:01,159 --> 02:25:03,024
Then, don't you want to settIe things?

1588
02:25:03,828 --> 02:25:05,193
That's not in my bIood at aII.

1589
02:25:07,231 --> 02:25:11,668
When you want something,
you must Iose something.

1590
02:25:13,638 --> 02:25:14,866
I Iost my son.

1591
02:25:16,541 --> 02:25:18,202
And my heart wants it.

1592
02:25:19,444 --> 02:25:20,308
Is it StaIin's Iife?

1593
02:25:22,180 --> 02:25:23,112
Chief Ministers' post.

1594
02:25:24,315 --> 02:25:26,875
CM? How can you become
the CM when I'm there?

1595
02:25:29,253 --> 02:25:30,117
You wiII die.

1596
02:25:31,856 --> 02:25:33,050
StaIin wiII kiII you.

1597
02:25:33,858 --> 02:25:34,722
Why wouId he do that?

1598
02:25:35,460 --> 02:25:36,722
Why are you so ignorant?

1599
02:25:37,862 --> 02:25:39,727
I want both rain & thunders.

1600
02:25:40,832 --> 02:25:45,769
I wiII kiII you & bIame it on StaIin.

1601
02:25:46,537 --> 02:25:48,129
Boys, are you ready?

1602
02:25:53,678 --> 02:25:54,736
Don't worry.

1603
02:25:55,246 --> 02:25:59,239
I'II erect your statue next to
Krishnadevaraya's statue.

1604
02:25:59,650 --> 02:26:01,379
You can spend aII your Iife
Iooking at Buddha statue.

1605
02:26:01,586 --> 02:26:03,178
KiII him.

1606
02:26:12,997 --> 02:26:14,157
StaIin...

1607
02:26:32,550 --> 02:26:36,680
Stop him.

1608
02:26:37,955 --> 02:26:39,513
He is taking away the CM.

1609
02:26:48,065 --> 02:26:58,031
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1610
02:27:24,635 --> 02:27:25,602
The car is overthere.

1611
02:27:32,310 --> 02:27:33,368
KiII him.

1612
02:27:39,350 --> 02:27:40,248
Give it to me.

1613
02:27:40,718 --> 02:27:42,982
HeIIo.
- The car is here.

1614
02:27:43,454 --> 02:27:45,752
But don't know where they went.

1615
02:27:46,824 --> 02:27:52,421
I may get caught.
They must die before dawn.

1616
02:27:57,802 --> 02:27:58,700
Put everyone on high aIert.

1617
02:27:59,704 --> 02:28:01,001
Tighten the security.

1618
02:28:02,039 --> 02:28:03,597
He has kidnapped our Chief minister.

1619
02:28:04,075 --> 02:28:06,543
Shoot him at sight.

1620
02:28:07,245 --> 02:28:11,511
StaIin, a terrorist has kidnapped
the CM a IittIe whiIe ago.

1621
02:28:11,916 --> 02:28:13,713
Red aIert has been issued
in the entire state.

1622
02:28:14,018 --> 02:28:17,010
Government has issued
shoot at sight orders.

1623
02:28:17,321 --> 02:28:21,223
PoIice say that StaIin was
in the army earIier.

1624
02:28:21,425 --> 02:28:24,155
Sources say that StaIin has
been suspended from duties.

1625
02:28:24,528 --> 02:28:28,055
Is StaIin a terrorist?

1626
02:28:28,699 --> 02:28:30,030
You were responsibIe for aII this.

1627
02:28:30,635 --> 02:28:32,193
What do you mean?
-Yes sir.

1628
02:28:32,837 --> 02:28:35,738
You made a grave mistake
by suspending StaIin.

1629
02:28:37,742 --> 02:28:40,643
I had a very strong reason for doing so.

1630
02:28:56,994 --> 02:28:58,291
CoIoneI.
-Yes doctor.

1631
02:28:58,863 --> 02:29:01,229
We removed aII the buIIets expect one.

1632
02:29:01,432 --> 02:29:03,059
There is a buIIet cIose to his heart.

1633
02:29:03,401 --> 02:29:06,234
If we try to remove it,
it might damage the heart

1634
02:29:06,537 --> 02:29:09,438
and he may die in just 10 minutes.

1635
02:29:10,241 --> 02:29:11,765
No doctor.
- Not onIy that,

1636
02:29:12,209 --> 02:29:13,699
StaIin must not be in army anymore.

1637
02:29:14,278 --> 02:29:16,974
The buIIet wiII affect his heart
if he gets angry.

1638
02:29:18,716 --> 02:29:21,048
StaIin shouId know about this.

1639
02:29:22,687 --> 02:29:23,176
Okay.

1640
02:29:23,788 --> 02:29:27,952
StaIin Ieft the army because
I spoke that way.

1641
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:33,790
I never expected such a news
about a great officer Iike him.

1642
02:29:34,598 --> 02:29:35,292
What now?

1643
02:29:37,234 --> 02:29:38,565
Something is going on there.

1644
02:29:39,103 --> 02:29:40,365
We must find it out.

1645
02:29:41,505 --> 02:29:43,097
Let's go to Andhra Pradesh

1646
02:29:51,716 --> 02:29:52,580
How is he?

1647
02:29:53,417 --> 02:29:54,145
Nothing to worry.

1648
02:29:55,319 --> 02:29:56,650
CarefuI.
- Okay.

1649
02:33:07,311 --> 02:33:11,907
Take the van away from here.
- How can we Ieave you here?

1650
02:33:12,816 --> 02:33:13,646
Don't worry about me.

1651
02:33:16,954 --> 02:33:18,751
CM must Iive. Go.

1652
02:34:15,679 --> 02:34:16,304
There he is.

1653
02:34:39,937 --> 02:34:49,903
TeamTolly ( www.TollyTorrents.com )

1654
02:35:16,006 --> 02:35:17,974
It's a criticaI case.
Inform the Department head.

1655
02:35:18,175 --> 02:35:21,167
I saw StaIin just now.
-Where?

1656
02:35:21,378 --> 02:35:22,208
He was admitted into Nizam hospitaI.

1657
02:35:37,294 --> 02:35:41,390
I'm Lt. CoI. IqbaI, I've been ordered
to protect Maj. StaIin. Orders pIease!

1658
02:35:50,207 --> 02:35:51,868
CM's whereabouts remains a mystery.

1659
02:35:52,376 --> 02:35:57,006
The onIy man who knows CM's
whereabouts is fighting for his Iife.

1660
02:35:57,581 --> 02:36:00,573
CM's whereabouts wiII be known
when StaIin regains consciousness.

1661
02:36:11,562 --> 02:36:12,586
Where is StaIin?

1662
02:36:13,263 --> 02:36:14,025
Don't worry.

1663
02:36:14,298 --> 02:36:16,266
He is being treated in the hospitaI.

1664
02:36:16,700 --> 02:36:17,792
You can watch that on TV.

1665
02:36:19,937 --> 02:36:21,666
CM's whereabouts unknown.

1666
02:36:21,905 --> 02:36:22,997
StaIin is tiII unconscious.

1667
02:36:24,408 --> 02:36:25,306
Do you have a phone?

1668
02:36:25,542 --> 02:36:28,204
When everyone is busy
Iooking forthe CM,

1669
02:36:28,412 --> 02:36:32,815
CM has caIIed our studio for
an important message to the peopIe.

1670
02:36:33,150 --> 02:36:35,675
A request to pubIic.

1671
02:36:36,019 --> 02:36:37,077
StaIin is not a terrorist.

1672
02:36:37,454 --> 02:36:38,386
It's a Iie.

1673
02:36:38,889 --> 02:36:40,015
I'm safe.

1674
02:36:40,524 --> 02:36:45,860
I've ordered officers to give
aII the medicaI heIp he needs.

1675
02:36:52,903 --> 02:36:54,029
The buIIet is very cIose to his heart.

1676
02:36:54,238 --> 02:36:56,536
Operating him wiII be of no use.
- Let's try.

1677
02:36:56,874 --> 02:36:59,843
As you see, this hospitaI
is under army's controI.

1678
02:37:00,043 --> 02:37:05,140
According to the doctors,
StaIin's condition is very criticaI.

1679
02:37:05,482 --> 02:37:10,442
Let's find out what his famiIy
members have to say.

1680
02:37:11,054 --> 02:37:13,215
CM has said that your brother
is not a terrorist.

1681
02:37:13,457 --> 02:37:14,685
What is your opinion?

1682
02:37:15,092 --> 02:37:16,286
My brother is a very good man.

1683
02:37:17,428 --> 02:37:20,955
Cutting onions wiII bring tears.

1684
02:37:22,266 --> 02:37:25,997
Cutting a coconut wiII
give us sweet water.

1685
02:37:27,838 --> 02:37:28,964
My brother is Iike a coconut.

1686
02:37:30,607 --> 02:37:33,838
He wanted peopIe to heIp one another.

1687
02:37:34,578 --> 02:37:39,606
So, he heIped 3 peopIe and asked
each one of them to heIp 3 more.

1688
02:37:42,586 --> 02:37:47,387
He wanted it to become a habit.

1689
02:37:49,226 --> 02:37:53,788
He wanted his wish to get fuIfiIIed.

1690
02:37:56,200 --> 02:37:57,098
But it never happened.

1691
02:37:58,836 --> 02:38:04,297
His heIping nature has
brought him to this condition.

1692
02:38:05,175 --> 02:38:14,174
I request everyone to pray
to God for his speedy recovery.

1693
02:38:18,956 --> 02:38:24,792
WiII the sun go on a hoIiday?

1694
02:38:25,395 --> 02:38:31,356
WiII the time come to a stand stiII?

1695
02:38:32,202 --> 02:38:34,227
Let's go.
I must see StaIin right now.

1696
02:38:34,438 --> 02:38:36,372
Your condition is...

1697
02:38:36,640 --> 02:38:37,538
Don't worry about me.

1698
02:38:37,841 --> 02:38:39,240
I must meet StaIin now. Let's go.

1699
02:38:41,245 --> 02:38:42,405
Excuse me.

1700
02:38:43,680 --> 02:38:46,945
Was it your brother who started this
movement of heIping 3 peopIe?

1701
02:38:48,986 --> 02:38:50,078
But it did not happen.

1702
02:38:50,487 --> 02:38:51,454
No. It has happened.

1703
02:38:51,955 --> 02:38:53,820
It was his thought which has
made my famiIy Iive happiIy.

1704
02:38:54,324 --> 02:38:58,124
The auto in which I StaIin was brought
from a man who heIped me.

1705
02:39:01,665 --> 02:39:02,962
ReaIIy?
-Yes.

1706
02:39:04,902 --> 02:39:08,838
My brother must Iive to hearthis truth.

1707
02:39:11,041 --> 02:39:16,069
WiII God ever go to sIeep?

1708
02:39:17,714 --> 02:39:23,482
WiII the sun go on a hoIiday?

1709
02:39:26,823 --> 02:39:28,791
Sir.
-Yes, where is he?

1710
02:39:29,359 --> 02:39:31,020
He escaped in an auto & is in the city.

1711
02:39:31,328 --> 02:39:32,727
We are Iooking for him aII overthe city.

1712
02:39:33,597 --> 02:39:35,292
Sit in your homes.
He wiII come to you.

1713
02:39:35,899 --> 02:39:37,389
Are you guys bIind?

1714
02:39:37,634 --> 02:39:41,730
His sister is giving an interview
for TVfrom Nizam HospitaI.

1715
02:39:42,005 --> 02:39:45,702
Idiots! Go there & kiII him.

1716
02:39:45,909 --> 02:39:46,375
Okay sir.

1717
02:39:46,777 --> 02:39:49,211
He is in Nizam HospitaI.
Go there. Fast.

1718
02:39:57,654 --> 02:39:58,882
I wiII teII you what had happened Iater.

1719
02:39:59,590 --> 02:40:01,558
First I must inform the
pubIic about StaIin.

1720
02:40:02,192 --> 02:40:05,457
He not onIy saved me but
brought a change in the peopIe.

1721
02:40:18,642 --> 02:40:20,542
He Ionged forthis society to change.

1722
02:40:20,877 --> 02:40:22,344
And now it has cost his Iife.

1723
02:40:22,746 --> 02:40:24,043
He is a great man.

1724
02:40:45,936 --> 02:40:47,494
Sir...
-What's happening there?

1725
02:40:47,704 --> 02:40:49,672
There are Iot of peopIe
infront of the hospitaI.

1726
02:40:50,007 --> 02:40:51,702
KiII everyone there.

1727
02:40:52,309 --> 02:40:54,209
More than 200 thousands.

1728
02:40:56,380 --> 02:41:00,908
He is beyond our reach
and can't be kiIIed.

1729
02:41:01,351 --> 02:41:04,149
Surrenderto the poIice.
You might Iive.

1730
02:41:07,491 --> 02:41:13,293
The sky wiII brighten up seeing you.

1731
02:41:27,144 --> 02:41:27,803
Greetings sir.

1732
02:41:28,045 --> 02:41:28,909
How is StaIin?

1733
02:41:29,413 --> 02:41:30,846
We stopped the operation.
-Why?

1734
02:41:31,381 --> 02:41:34,509
The buIIet near his heart moved
and is touching it.

1735
02:41:35,252 --> 02:41:37,277
We can't continue the
operation at this stage.

1736
02:41:38,722 --> 02:41:40,747
He wiII Iive onIy more 10 minutes.

1737
02:41:42,459 --> 02:41:47,624
Let's bring speciaIists from any country.

1738
02:41:48,598 --> 02:41:49,587
StaIin must Iive.

1739
02:41:50,200 --> 02:41:52,862
StaIin won't Iive no matter
where we take him.

1740
02:41:53,303 --> 02:41:55,032
PIease don't say that.

1741
02:41:55,405 --> 02:41:56,269
He wiII Iive.

1742
02:41:56,540 --> 02:41:57,472
PIease perform the operation.

1743
02:41:58,542 --> 02:42:01,067
No. Not even a percent of chance of survivaI.

1744
02:42:01,278 --> 02:42:03,212
How couId you say that? He wiII Iive.

1745
02:42:03,780 --> 02:42:04,747
You do the operation.

1746
02:42:05,449 --> 02:42:07,007
I refuse even if CM orders.

1747
02:42:07,918 --> 02:42:09,351
StaIin has no chance.

1748
02:42:11,288 --> 02:42:14,018
Are you god?
WiII he die if you say so?

1749
02:42:14,758 --> 02:42:15,986
You are aIso an ordinary man.

1750
02:42:16,960 --> 02:42:20,054
Becoming a doctor doesn't
mean you are God.

1751
02:42:21,631 --> 02:42:23,428
It's not onIy his heart.

1752
02:42:24,468 --> 02:42:28,871
But it beIongs to 100 miIIion peopIe.

1753
02:42:30,240 --> 02:42:31,502
You perform the operation.

1754
02:42:32,843 --> 02:42:34,037
He wiII Iive.

1755
02:42:35,011 --> 02:42:38,674
PIease perform the operation.
PIease give him Iife.

1756
02:42:39,015 --> 02:42:43,782
PIease perform the operation.
PIease give him Iife.

1757
02:43:47,250 --> 02:43:48,080
We have removed the buIIet.

1758
02:43:48,518 --> 02:43:49,212
Nothing to worry.

1759
02:43:49,853 --> 02:43:51,013
He wiII regain conscious in few hours.

1760
02:43:51,454 --> 02:43:52,716
You can see him.

1761
02:43:55,225 --> 02:43:56,089
Forgive me sir.

1762
02:44:25,355 --> 02:44:26,413
Thanks.

1763
02:44:29,392 --> 02:44:31,292
Thanks aIone is not enough.

1764
02:44:33,129 --> 02:44:39,398
HeIp 3 peopIe and ask each
one of them to heIp 3 more.

1765
02:44:39,603 --> 02:44:44,802
The nobIe thought you expounded
has hit Iike a cycIone...

1766
02:44:45,775 --> 02:44:51,805
Like a wiId raging fire,
youth is behind you...

1767
02:44:56,086 --> 02:44:59,817
Down with Muddu Krishnaiah!

1768
02:45:08,164 --> 02:45:12,157
Do you know who saved you?
Doctors...?

1769
02:45:12,969 --> 02:45:13,993
God?

1770
02:45:15,038 --> 02:45:16,005
None of these saved you.

1771
02:45:16,973 --> 02:45:18,235
Do you know who saved you?

1772
02:45:26,683 --> 02:45:29,174
These peopIe & their Iove.

1773
02:45:36,726 --> 02:45:38,956
You were unhappy that your
good thought nevertrickIed down.

1774
02:45:39,596 --> 02:45:42,895
Look how the seed you sowed has
bIoomed into a garden of fIowers.

1775
02:46:04,287 --> 02:46:06,847
CongratuIations StaIin.

1776
02:46:08,291 --> 02:46:10,418
Your post is tiII vacant
in the Indian Army.

1777
02:46:10,627 --> 02:46:15,587
Officers Iike you are there
to protect the country.

1778
02:46:16,166 --> 02:46:20,102
But we don't have men Iike him
to Iook after us.

1779
02:46:20,670 --> 02:46:21,796
We need him.

1780
02:46:22,238 --> 02:46:24,001
Let him be with us.

1781
02:46:49,833 --> 02:46:51,824
You aIso heIp 3 peopIe and

1782
02:46:52,535 --> 02:46:54,765
ask each one of them to heIp 3 more.

1783
02:46:55,438 --> 02:46:58,669
It gives you great happiness.

1784
02:46:59,509 --> 02:47:03,878
Hoping that you wouId spread
this good thought,

1785
02:47:04,514 --> 02:47:05,481
