1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,467
I learned to fly a plane.

2
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:17,933
I lost interest in it.

3
00:00:18,033 --> 00:00:18,900
Water skiiing.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,867
I lost interest in it.

5
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:26,333
But, uh, this is something you don't conquer.

6
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,800
Anything that can fight to the death

7
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,733
And not utter a sound, well.

8
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:36,867
The person that puts the most and works the hardest

9
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:37,967
Is supposed to win.

10
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,167
And usually that's the way it comes out.

11
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:42,900
The drive in it is to be the best.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,433
We call it sharpness.

13
00:00:46,533 --> 00:00:48,567
When you can hit that peak.

14
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:52,933
When that bird is at his
best, then he'll win for you,

15
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,533
Because you make your luck.

16
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:58,733
I can pick out the best bird by his conformation,

17
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:00,667
His bone structure.

18
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:04,933
But I can't look into his heart
and tell you how game he is.

19
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:18,533
You know what you said in your sleep last night?

20
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:19,800
You said, Randy, you mother.

21
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm gonna kick your shit ass clear across this room.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,067
You remember that?

23
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:28,067
Who's Randy?

24
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,267
You can't fool me.

25
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,233
If you can talk when you're asleep,

26
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,567
You can talk when you're awake.

27
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,067
I just want you to know I know it.

28
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,233
That's some mighty Sandspur, huh.

29
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:08,500
Well, what kind of money we talking about this hack?

30
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,967
What, $100?

31
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,333
Shit.

32
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:18,567
I figured on taking you for at least $1,000.

33
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,733
I'm risking my $200 ace against your $100 bet.

34
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:27,433
Uh, I don't know.

35
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,900
I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll put up another $900

36
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,500
Against your car and trailer.

37
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,300
Even money.

38
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:50,667
That's the car and trailer plus the $100, OK?

39
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:51,633
I'll catch you later.

40
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,933
When I was doing to Sandspur's bill

41
00:05:10,067 --> 00:05:15,533
Wasn't exactly illegal, but I
didn't feel too proud about it.

42
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,500
Only wanted to boost the betting
odds by making the gamblers

43
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,633
Think that Sandspur's bill was cracked.

44
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:24,133
$750.

45
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,233
They want this all on Sandspur.

46
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,733
Forget it.

47
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,367
You know I can't get a four to one bet.

48
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:51,367
Cracked bill?

49
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:56,933
Hell.

50
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:58,733
Now I don't know who to bed, you or Burke.

51
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,767
Maybe I'll be able to get some out.

52
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:10,467
Five pounds, two ounces, even.

53
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:11,433
You handling Jack?

54
00:06:11,533 --> 00:06:12,867
No, Ralph's going to handle him.

55
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,400
He's about half pounds over, you're going

56
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,733
To have to cut away, Frank.

57
00:06:21,833 --> 00:06:23,067
Uh he can have the half pound.

58
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:25,767
He can have shit, you know
there's no two ounce leeway.

59
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,433
Official SCT hack.

60
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:30,200
What I meant was, uh, it
don't make no never mind to me.

61
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,967
It makes a difference to the better, Jack.

62
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,500
Five two, even.

63
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,733
See that, Jack?

64
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,167
He's got a cracked beak.

65
00:06:54,267 --> 00:06:55,233
Yeah?

66
00:06:55,333 --> 00:06:56,600
Well if I'd known he had a cracked bill

67
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:00,533
I'd give you some odds.

68
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:01,533
Who wants to call it?

69
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,067
Tails it is.

70
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:09,500
That's a short guess.

71
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,600
Set him low and outside there.

72
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,400
What was that?

73
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:40,567
Burke was a long gaff man,

74
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:43,167
But I preferred the short heels.

75
00:07:43,267 --> 00:07:47,467
Sandspur was a cutter and all
the best would short gaffs.

76
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,300
I mean David was used to long, three-inch heels.

77
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,533
By me winning the toss, I'd given Sandspur

78
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:56,133
A slight advantage over little David.

79
00:07:56,233 --> 00:08:00,500
Ladies and gentleman, this is
an extra hack between Mr. Jack

80
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,733
Burke, Burke's Farm, Mr. Frank
Mansfield, Mansfield Farms,

81
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,167
Decatur.

82
00:08:08,267 --> 00:08:12,533
The official southern conference
hack, no time limit, no draw,

83
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:13,933
Both birds with short gaffs.

84
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,700
Mr. Ralph Hansen will handle for Mr. Burke.

85
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,600
That's enough.

86
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,567
Handle.

87
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,833
Get ready.

88
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:50,767
Hit.

89
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:15,567
Handle.

90
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,367
Get ready.

91
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,300
Handle.

92
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:12,100
That broken beak lost your
bird his pecker power, Frank.

93
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,467
The winner is Mr. Burke.

94
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:40,200
Well, got it all down, Frank,
yours and mine, three to one.

95
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,700
Great Sandspur, game but lame.

96
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,933
You ought to give up this shit, Frank.

97
00:11:51,033 --> 00:11:54,433
Well, don't look for me in Milledgeville this year.

98
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,033
I was getting ready to wash them.

99
00:12:50,967 --> 00:12:52,967
I never heard of anybody so
mean they'd take a family's

100
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,233
Mobile home away from them.

101
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,633
Now, little lady, we made a bet,

102
00:12:56,733 --> 00:13:00,200
You see, and we shook hands on it.

103
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,833
Nobody shook my hand.

104
00:13:01,933 --> 00:13:03,300
What about me, what happens to me?

105
00:13:06,333 --> 00:13:08,333
No, I don't know about that, Frank.

106
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:10,033
I got, I got me a lady friend up in Kissimmee.

107
00:13:18,933 --> 00:13:20,167
Uh, little, little David'll meet

108
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:22,267
Any challenges, any five two challenges

109
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:23,633
You want to show against him.

110
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,367
Only put your money where your
mouth is in Milledgeville.

111
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,133
Frank!

112
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:36,600
Please take me with you.

113
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,667
Please Frank.

114
00:13:37,767 --> 00:13:41,467
How will I staying with old Mr. Burke?

115
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:42,433
He must be 40 years old.

116
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,900
I felt sorry for her in a way.

117
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,067
But I didn't worry about her.

118
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,200
She was pretty and young.

119
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
A good lay.

120
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,267
Hell, she'd get by anywhere.

121
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:12,433
Piss on her and the horse she rode in on.

122
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,933
That's an old trick you tried today, Frank.

123
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:36,167
I've done it myself and I've
gotten away with it, too.

124
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:40,633
The trick, you see, is not
to cut the groove too deep.

125
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:43,067
If you cut too deep, it's liable to cost

126
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:44,433
You your car and trailer.

127
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:53,067
Two years ago, this medal
could have been in your hand.

128
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:55,133
But you had to shoot your mouth off and lose

129
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,533
The bird you needed to win.

130
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:07,567
I've got the finest five pound chicken alive, Jack.

131
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,133
Right here in my hands.

132
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,200
The very finest.

133
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,133
You want to know something, boy?

134
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:18,167
I am the finest trainer and
conditioner in the whole world.

135
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:21,067
And my bird here, he can beat
anything you got to show, man.

136
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:22,667
Anything.

137
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,067
Anything.

138
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,433
Hey listen, I'm, I'm getting
tired of listening to you

139
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,300
Brag, Frank, goddammit.

140
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,200
Why don't you put some money
where your mouth is right now.

141
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,667
C'mon, Frank's just talking.

142
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,067
Jack, it's 2 o'clock in the morning.

143
00:15:33,133 --> 00:15:34,233
No, no, no, no, wait a minute, he's

144
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,767
Been doing all the god damn bragging, let's see

145
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:37,300
A little action now, all right?

146
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,633
No, we're going to find out right now, OK?

147
00:15:39,733 --> 00:15:42,600
$200, flat out, no odds.

148
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:46,333
$200? $200 even, OK, give your money to Lucille.

149
00:15:46,733 --> 00:15:48,433
All right Lucille, keep the change, sweetie.

150
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,200
You ready?

151
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
Do it, let's go.

152
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,333
OK, bill them up.

153
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,167
Get ready.

154
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:13,133
Hit them!

155
00:17:46,067 --> 00:17:47,533
Jack wins, Frank.

156
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:48,967
Have you got another five pound rooster you

157
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,500
Can use in the derby tomorrow?

158
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,567
It's too bad, Frank.

159
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,467
Now you'll have to withdraw from the derby,

160
00:17:55,567 --> 00:17:56,933
Which means you ain't got a fighting

161
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:59,433
Chance for the medal this year.

162
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:01,400
You got two little faults, Frank.

163
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,300
You drank too much and you talk too much.

164
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,333
Yeah.

165
00:18:09,433 --> 00:18:11,267
I ought to keep my mouth shut.

166
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,567
I am.

167
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,967
I'm going to keep my mouth
shut until I win that medal.

168
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:16,633
I'll tell them to stick it up their ass.

169
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:18,800
All those sons of bitches.

170
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,600
It's 5:30.

171
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:22,500
You gonna sleep all day?

172
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,700
Come on out the yard.

173
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
We can have breakfast later.

174
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:51,600
Except for these battered greys,

175
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,567
White Lightning here's the
only game cock I've got left.

176
00:18:56,667 --> 00:18:58,133
Haven't fought him yet.

177
00:18:58,267 --> 00:19:00,533
Just about everything I've
ever learned about breeding's

178
00:19:00,633 --> 00:19:02,367
Gone into this one.

179
00:19:02,467 --> 00:19:07,167
And when the time comes,
he'll out cut and out shuffle

180
00:19:07,267 --> 00:19:08,633
Every game cock in the South.

181
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,733
If a cock's legs

182
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,300
Hang down in perfect alignment with his body,

183
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,900
He's a close hitter.

184
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,067
This cock's legs were perfect.

185
00:19:34,567 --> 00:19:36,867
You want this chicken, Frank?

186
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:37,667
He's yours, then.

187
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:40,433
For $500.

188
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:43,033
I know the price is unreasonable.

189
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:47,367
But pay me, and you can take him.

190
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:49,267
I wouldn't be selling him if I hadn't promised

191
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,533
Martha I'd quit cock fighting.

192
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:55,300
He's yours when you bring the money.

193
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,633
Go out and have some breakfast, and I'll drive

194
00:19:57,733 --> 00:19:58,600
You down to the bus station.

195
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,467
Where did I want to go?

196
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,400
The lease on my Decatur farm
had two more years to run,

197
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,800
And it was all paid up.

198
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,533
But without any game file and, uh,

199
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:40,267
Without any funds to buy any, wasn't

200
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:43,300
Any point in going out there.

201
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,033
First thing I had to do was get some money.

202
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:13,100
Frank!

203
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,567
You devil.

204
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:18,067
You would have to catch me looking like this.

205
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:29,067
Well, stop grinning like an
ape sit down, I'll feed you.

206
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:32,100
Coffee's all ready.

207
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,500
You may have lost your voice,
but you can still write.

208
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,133
We haven't heard from you in six months.

209
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:40,967
Well if it ain't the junior bird man.

210
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:48,600
Welcome home, bubba.

211
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,467
How long you gonna stay?

212
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:04,267
The, uh, enigmatic response Frank.

213
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,667
I suspect, uh, you've come home to collect

214
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,900
That honest debt I owe you?

215
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,167
Too bad, bubba, because I
have a hard time raising $25,

216
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:19,733
Let alone $2,500.

217
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,467
But it's your house, so, you're welcome to stay

218
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:24,633
As long as you like.

219
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:26,733
Would you like a job, honey?

220
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:27,533
Uh uh.

221
00:22:54,267 --> 00:22:55,500
My old room was

222
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,567
At the end of the front hall next to the bathroom.

223
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:00,167
Nothing had changed much in two years

224
00:23:00,267 --> 00:23:03,567
Except for all the junk that
had been stored in there.

225
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,800
Things sure have a way of getting

226
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:07,967
Out of place after a time.

227
00:23:08,067 --> 00:23:11,233
Frank, you busy?

228
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,833
There's somebody here to see you, Frank.

229
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,167
And I bet you can't guess who.

230
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:19,700
At least you could put your shoes on.

231
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,217
He's on his way.

232
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,683
Still his gentle, warm-hearted self.

233
00:23:24,783 --> 00:23:26,350
Come on in the kitchen, Randall.

234
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,217
What for?

235
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,717
She's pretty quick on the horn,
is she all right out there?

236
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,917
She's fine.

237
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:16,050
It's just mama.

238
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:18,783
It's the nurses' day off, I have
to drop her by Mrs. Roswell's.

239
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:24,650
When I mentioned your name,
you should have seen her face,

240
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:27,650
She got all excited.

241
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,550
I know she remembers.

242
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:58,350
Frank!

243
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:15,550
My goodness, what do you
think I am, the welcome wagon?

244
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,383
I haven't seen you in six months,

245
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:23,283
And you expect... I don't know what you expect.

246
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:25,517
It's hard to get inside of a stone wall's head.

247
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:45,217
Francis said there was a chance you

248
00:25:45,283 --> 00:25:47,650
Might decide to stay this time.

249
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,550
Is there any truth to that wild rumor?

250
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,517
Joe Lee asked me to marry him.

251
00:25:57,217 --> 00:25:59,550
Got myself a piece of land.

252
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,950
Joe Lee gets me, he's getting a bargain.

253
00:26:11,517 --> 00:26:14,317
I told him I'd give him and answer.

254
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,117
You hungry?

255
00:26:26,217 --> 00:26:27,750
Want to get a hamburger or something?

256
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,750
Was getting kind of hungry myself.

257
00:26:46,317 --> 00:26:47,450
Mama?

258
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,850
You remember Frank, he was one of your favorites.

259
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,383
He was everybody's favorite.

260
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,517
I ever tell you about Johnny Erwin?

261
00:27:08,617 --> 00:27:10,750
Boy who peed on the wall in study hall?

262
00:27:14,317 --> 00:27:17,950
Teacher wouldn't let him go the bathroom.

263
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:22,617
So he kept raising his hand, saying, teacher, I

264
00:27:22,717 --> 00:27:25,217
Can't hold it, I ain't kidding.

265
00:27:25,317 --> 00:27:28,217
So finally, she wouldn't let him go to the bathroom

266
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:33,850
After 30 minutes, and he just got

267
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:38,850
Up, walked back to the corner, and peed on the wall.

268
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:48,717
She took him down to the principal's office,

269
00:27:48,817 --> 00:27:54,217
And Mr. Tomlin says, son, you are expelled.

270
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:58,817
And he says, I don't give a
shit, I'mma join the Marines.

271
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,217
He did!

272
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:08,983
He jumped, he jumped in his '52 Chevy,

273
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:12,350
And started out to San Diego, and then

274
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,483
When he got to New Mexico, he ran into a bridge post

275
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,350
And killed himself.

276
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:28,750
He never would have made Marine, anyway, I maintain.

277
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:34,483
I think it was suicide.

278
00:28:34,583 --> 00:28:35,417
You know what it proves?

279
00:28:42,217 --> 00:28:44,783
The value of self control.

280
00:28:44,883 --> 00:28:47,217
If he hadn't had to pee, he'd be alive today.

281
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:57,717
Just like you and cock fighting.

282
00:28:57,817 --> 00:29:01,217
Something over which you have
absolutely no self control.

283
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,617
I want.

284
00:29:12,717 --> 00:29:17,817
I want to get married and have children.

285
00:29:17,917 --> 00:29:20,050
I wanna have them here where we both have roots.

286
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,250
I'm not going to marry you and live some old game

287
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,850
Cock farm in Decatur.

288
00:29:33,817 --> 00:29:35,483
I'm not going to wait for you forever.

289
00:29:39,217 --> 00:29:41,450
I waited long enough.

290
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:29,783
Jake, would you please tell me what's going on here?

291
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:33,050
Good morning, Mr. Mansfield,
we're here to move your house.

292
00:31:33,217 --> 00:31:33,850
Frank, what's happening?

293
00:31:40,883 --> 00:31:41,583
Randy!

294
00:31:45,617 --> 00:31:46,683
What's going on?

295
00:31:46,783 --> 00:31:47,483
What are they doing?

296
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,217
They've come for the house.

297
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,650
Frank sold it.

298
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,083
Well he can't do that.

299
00:31:57,217 --> 00:31:58,517
Can he?

300
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:03,317
You better call you daddy and
tell him he's having company.

301
00:32:20,417 --> 00:32:22,083
Put it away.

302
00:32:22,217 --> 00:32:25,217
No game cock's worth $500.

303
00:32:25,317 --> 00:32:27,683
I'm sick of game fowl anyway.

304
00:32:27,783 --> 00:32:29,417
Let's go get your rooster.

305
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:32,317
Those two battered greys are in fine feather again.

306
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,783
You can have the hen, too.

307
00:32:33,883 --> 00:32:36,283
Can't you wait till Frank finished his breakfast?

308
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:38,550
I'm not rushing him.

309
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:40,783
I can get you a good deal on a dozen Melhorn blacks,

310
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:43,517
If you're interested.

311
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,083
I got the wire.

312
00:33:17,217 --> 00:33:19,983
Mr. Omar, he helped me get the Melhorns last night

313
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:20,850
From the Express Depot.

314
00:33:45,917 --> 00:33:46,650
White Lightning.

315
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,217
Mighty pretty bird, Mr. Frank.

316
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,683
He's soft now, but he won't be long.

317
00:34:17,217 --> 00:34:19,217
Those Melhorn blacks look awfully good, Frank,

318
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:21,250
But we had to water them at the station.

319
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,750
The baggage people must be afraid to water chickens

320
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,017
En route.

321
00:34:25,117 --> 00:34:29,750
This here ace I don't know about him.

322
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,217
Yeah, I can see his high spurs, but he's an ace cock.

323
00:34:56,283 --> 00:34:57,783
That is one game chicken.

324
00:35:02,217 --> 00:35:04,217
I guess I'm pretty good, huh Frank?

325
00:35:17,583 --> 00:35:19,317
Nothing else to do, I reckon.

326
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:20,550
I don't know, Buford.

327
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,983
That was a $75 rooster with two wins already.

328
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,350
I'd have pitted him in the pit first.

329
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,750
He'd be tough all right.

330
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:31,250
But Mr. Frank, he say when a
bird got high spurs like that,

331
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:32,517
He miss more than he hits.

332
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:33,317
So?

333
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,217
When did he tell you that?

334
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:39,450
There's a lot of things I
don't like about cock fighting,

335
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,450
But it's a business.

336
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:43,217
You're either in or you're out.

337
00:35:43,317 --> 00:35:45,717
And I'm all the way into cock fighting.

338
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:52,350
Frank, you and I need each other.

339
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:55,383
Why don't we form a partnership, just for the season.

340
00:35:55,483 --> 00:35:59,717
Wait, before you answer me,
think it over for a day or two.

341
00:35:59,817 --> 00:36:02,383
If you conditioned and handled, and I took

342
00:36:02,483 --> 00:36:03,517
Care of the business details.

343
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:07,617
Well let it go for now.

344
00:36:07,717 --> 00:36:10,583
But bear in mind, I'm filthy with capital.

345
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:14,983
Well, no matter what you decide, why don't you

346
00:36:15,083 --> 00:36:17,517
Come over for dinner tonight.

347
00:36:17,617 --> 00:36:20,750
I'll take that high-spurred rooster home with me.

348
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:23,050
Tonight you and I'll feast on stewed

349
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:26,250
Melhorn black and dumplings
with a bottle of Pouilly-Fuisse.

350
00:36:29,617 --> 00:36:34,517
Stewed chicken for two, $37.50 a plate!

351
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:02,983
Farmer says I gotta get a young rooster in here

352
00:37:03,083 --> 00:37:05,583
And shake up these hens.

353
00:37:05,683 --> 00:37:08,617
So the old rooster hears him say that.

354
00:37:08,717 --> 00:37:10,750
Farmer drops a young rooster in
there we're and the old rooster

355
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:13,883
Says I gotta tell you something
about staying in condition.

356
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,050
He says, c'mon with me.

357
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:17,950
He says, we're going to run
around this cockhouse about

358
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:19,050
Three times.

359
00:37:19,217 --> 00:37:20,450
You've gotta stay in condition if you're

360
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:22,917
Going to take over this barnyard
and take care of these hens.

361
00:37:23,017 --> 00:37:24,717
He said, I'll show you something.

362
00:37:24,817 --> 00:37:26,117
Then well she says OK.

363
00:37:26,217 --> 00:37:28,217
He says, now you follow me.

364
00:37:28,283 --> 00:37:30,983
First we'll crow, we'll wake up the farmer, c'mon.

365
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:31,950
He says, OK.

366
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,683
So he goes

367
00:37:33,783 --> 00:37:35,817
Like that, and the young one goes

368
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,650
The farmer wakes up and he's looking out the window

369
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,417
And the old rooster keeps raising like that.

370
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:40,783
He's looking back over his shoulder

371
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,950
And the young rooster is six paces behind him, see.

372
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:46,217
And the old farmer takes one
look, and he picks up a shotgun

373
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,917
And he goes, blam!

374
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:50,950
And he knocks off the young rooster.

375
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,917
And he goes, dammit.

376
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:56,917
That's the third faggot rooster I had this week.

377
00:37:57,017 --> 00:38:03,783
Whaddya say, Frank?

378
00:38:03,883 --> 00:38:04,583
Partners?

379
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,383
For the season?

380
00:38:08,383 --> 00:38:09,083
Partners!

381
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:10,317
Oh, baby.

382
00:38:10,417 --> 00:38:11,817
You'd better stay out late tonight because we got

383
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:13,883
An early start in the morning.

384
00:38:31,217 --> 00:38:32,617
Like people, every game cock

385
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:34,517
Has to be handled differently.

386
00:38:34,617 --> 00:38:36,783
You know, a chicken's brain's about the size of a BB,

387
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:39,450
But within those brains, there's an infinite variety

388
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:41,750
Of character and personality traits.

389
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,417
The game cock is the most stupid creature on earth,

390
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:47,383
And the most intelligent fighter.

391
00:38:47,483 --> 00:38:49,217
I ran the cocks.

392
00:38:49,317 --> 00:38:51,017
The game cock has to fight fast.

393
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:53,650
And the running strengthens his legs.

394
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,217
I ran them 20 times the first day,

395
00:38:56,317 --> 00:38:59,550
30 second, increasing the number of runs 10 a day

396
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:01,450
Until they reach 100.

397
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,717
Now he can run like a striped-ass ape.

398
00:39:13,683 --> 00:39:15,050
Well if all that doesn't bother him,

399
00:39:15,217 --> 00:39:19,350
He can fight in Times Square on New Year's Eve.

400
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:21,750
How you getting along with
Frank since he stopped talking?

401
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,550
Hell.

402
00:39:24,683 --> 00:39:27,117
I like him better now.

403
00:39:27,217 --> 00:39:28,617
Before his big mouth lost him the cock

404
00:39:28,717 --> 00:39:29,650
Fight of the end medal?

405
00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:32,050
He was on to my tail all the time.

406
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:34,017
Buford do this, Buford do that.

407
00:39:34,117 --> 00:39:38,417
Now he do what he has to do and I do what I do.

408
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:40,550
Everything's nice and quiet.

409
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:15,317
Hit him where it hurts!

410
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:42,117
He'll never make it now

411
00:40:42,217 --> 00:40:45,017
Get ready.

412
00:40:45,117 --> 00:40:45,817
Hit.

413
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:47,250
Kick it up!

414
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,217
Get Ready!

415
00:41:40,433 --> 00:41:43,433
My cock was bored, how could he be a runner?

416
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,967
A runner's a cock that runs, Omar.

417
00:41:46,067 --> 00:41:47,267
Pete wins, dammit.

418
00:41:47,367 --> 00:41:48,933
Y'all's cock left the pit.

419
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:49,867
Pete.

420
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:50,767
He was confused.

421
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:51,867
He wanted to get back to the pit,

422
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,133
He just forgot where it was.

423
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:55,633
You heard what the referee said.

424
00:41:55,733 --> 00:41:57,633
Yeah, I heard him.

425
00:42:11,233 --> 00:42:13,567
Mr. Mansfield?

426
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,800
Saw you 52 up on the board.

427
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,700
Our roosters won two fights this year.

428
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,767
Least the guy I bought him from

429
00:42:21,867 --> 00:42:23,900
Said he won two fights.

430
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,567
I'd like to bet you $25 even money.

431
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,500
Hm?

432
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:36,667
You got yourself a bet, son.

433
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,433
You're going to have to fight him short heel.

434
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:39,233
Got a pair?

435
00:42:39,333 --> 00:42:40,333
I ain't got no heels.

436
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,400
Yeah, no problem, I'll lend you a pair.

437
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,567
Want me to heal them for you?

438
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,067
No, I don't need nobody to heel them for me,

439
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,067
I heel lots of birds.

440
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,933
This here's and extra hack.

441
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:53,400
Mr. Mansfield's white against Junior's grey.

442
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,867
Both birds weigh 5.2, fighting in short heel.

443
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,367
Bill them up.

444
00:43:03,933 --> 00:43:05,333
That's enough.

445
00:43:05,433 --> 00:43:07,067
Flush your birds.

446
00:43:07,133 --> 00:43:07,833
Flush her one time.

447
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:09,400
Flush her.

448
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,867
On your score.

449
00:43:11,967 --> 00:43:12,833
Hit!

450
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:54,967
Foul!

451
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:56,900
Whaddya mean, foul!

452
00:43:57,067 --> 00:43:58,433
You stuck your finger up that cock's ass!

453
00:43:58,533 --> 00:44:00,533
I was told if you stick your finger up there

454
00:44:00,633 --> 00:44:01,833
And rub his balls a little bit, then it

455
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:02,867
Puts some life in your chicken.

456
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:03,767
Who told you that?

457
00:44:03,867 --> 00:44:04,800
My daddy did.

458
00:44:06,233 --> 00:44:08,233
When you stick you finger
in a cock's ass like that...

459
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:09,400
C'mon, now, is it a foul?

460
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:13,833
With that sharp fingernail, that's a foul.

461
00:44:13,933 --> 00:44:15,200
That's the way to throw a fight.

462
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:20,067
Mr. Mansfield, look, I didn't know that.

463
00:44:20,133 --> 00:44:23,467
I swear I didn't know it
and... and, I apologize to you.

464
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:25,667
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

465
00:44:25,767 --> 00:44:26,967
You're blacklisted from this pit,

466
00:44:27,067 --> 00:44:29,733
And all Southern conference pits.

467
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,600
How long's the blacklist?

468
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,167
Forever, boy, and your daddy too.

469
00:44:42,733 --> 00:44:46,500
Oh, right, I owe you $25, don't I. Uh.

470
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,633
I'll tell you, Mr. Mansfield,
I didn't bring no cash with me.

471
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:50,433
You know, I was so sure I was gonna win,

472
00:44:50,533 --> 00:44:53,067
I just left it all at home, but I got some at home,

473
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,900
And as soon as I get there, I'm gonna get it,

474
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,333
I'm gonna bring it here and give it to you.

475
00:44:56,433 --> 00:44:58,100
Oh God damn!

476
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,933
Let go of my chicken!

477
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:00,400
Dear Mary Elizabeth.

478
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,600
We have got to make a decision about what

479
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,800
To do with our lives.

480
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:08,567
Until you've been to a cock fight,

481
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:13,333
Or seen me in the cock pit, we won't ever

482
00:46:13,433 --> 00:46:14,133
Have any understanding.

483
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm sending you two tickets to
the Milledgeville tournament

484
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,667
For March the 15th and 16th.

485
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,267
All my love, Frank.

486
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:38,967
PS you've got to give me a fighting chance.

487
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:30,100
Good luck, Mr. Mansfield.

488
00:48:30,533 --> 00:48:32,400
For this last derby fight.

489
00:48:34,933 --> 00:48:35,633
You fellas get ready.

490
00:48:39,733 --> 00:48:41,900
Get ready.

491
00:48:42,067 --> 00:48:43,067
On your lines.

492
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,467
Hit 'em.

493
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:58,167
Don't suppose you heard the good news.

494
00:48:58,267 --> 00:48:59,867
Get ready.

495
00:48:59,967 --> 00:49:04,567
On the line Hit 'em.

496
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:05,933
Remember Dody White?

497
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:14,400
Well.

498
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,333
I married her, Frank.

499
00:49:31,533 --> 00:49:34,067
Foul.

500
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:35,567
But the wins.

501
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:57,767
Frank, she's uh, she's got
the wild idea from somewhere

502
00:49:57,867 --> 00:49:59,200
That you can talk.

503
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,867
And uh, and she's afraid you're gonna say something

504
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:04,067
About, uh, you and her.

505
00:50:04,133 --> 00:50:06,967
And, uh, well I know it's a lot of crap,

506
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:08,300
But you know how women are.

507
00:50:10,933 --> 00:50:13,933
Mr. Pete Chocolate, the derby winner, and Jack Burke,

508
00:50:14,033 --> 00:50:15,067
The close second.

509
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,733
Well, anyway, I'll tell her I talked to you.

510
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,067
Here's the big one you been waiting on, folks.

511
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,000
Shakes and no weight limits.

512
00:50:25,100 --> 00:50:26,000
You bill 'em up, gentlemen.

513
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:36,267
I got $25, $20.

514
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:37,800
I call $25, $20.

515
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,100
I'm on the black chicken.

516
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,333
I'll lay $25, $30

517
00:50:40,433 --> 00:50:41,267
I'll lay it.

518
00:50:41,367 --> 00:50:42,333
You're on.

519
00:50:42,433 --> 00:50:44,933
I'll lay $25, $30. $25, $30 on the red.

520
00:50:45,033 --> 00:50:45,933
I'll lay $30, $20.

521
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:47,433
I'll lay $100, $80.

522
00:50:47,533 --> 00:50:49,433
I'll lay $50, $75. $50, $75 on the black.

523
00:50:49,533 --> 00:50:51,933
$25, $30.

524
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:56,400
Oh you got 50 on the black, I got the black rooster.

525
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,900
Hit 'em.

526
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:42,733
What were the odds on Mrs. Burke?

527
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,433
Well, if we don't count out dead chickens,

528
00:52:47,533 --> 00:52:50,967
We're $3,800 ahead on the derby in the main winnings.

529
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,800
Now, if you want to, we can skip
either Chattanooga or Biloxi,

530
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:55,667
And spend the extra time
conditioning for Milledgeville.

531
00:53:00,133 --> 00:53:02,100
When the pressure's on, gentlemen, a promoter's just

532
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:03,833
Gotta do the best he can.

533
00:53:03,933 --> 00:53:06,467
When the SPCA got its dander up, why,

534
00:53:06,567 --> 00:53:08,567
The Sheriff just had to go along with them,

535
00:53:08,667 --> 00:53:09,433
That's all there is to it.

536
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:11,067
County elections, you see.

537
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:14,767
But I got next to the city
officials without no trouble.

538
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:18,167
So instead of fighting out to the game club, why,

539
00:53:18,267 --> 00:53:20,633
We can stage our little derby right here in the hotel

540
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:21,433
Without no trouble.

541
00:53:24,533 --> 00:53:27,733
Just take a feel of this, this wonderful pit floor.

542
00:53:27,833 --> 00:53:31,233
Why, a, a carpet like this, all nylon,

543
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,133
Makes a wonderful period.

544
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:35,233
And you don't have to worry about damages, neither,

545
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:38,433
Because that's my look out.

546
00:53:38,533 --> 00:53:41,667
We also got exclusive use of the service elevator

547
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:45,600
Out here to bring that cocks
up from the basement garage.

548
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,667
There won't be many spectators, but you'll

549
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,767
Be able to get any bets covered because there are

550
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:52,367
Three really big money men flying in this afternoon

551
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:53,567
From Nashville.

552
00:53:53,667 --> 00:53:54,433
Frankly, gentlemen, I...

553
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:55,567
I've got a question.

554
00:53:55,667 --> 00:53:57,400
What do we with the dead cocks, Mr. Reed?

555
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,700
That's an excellent question, Mr. Whipple.

556
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:02,400
The dead cops will be stacked in the bathtub.

557
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:03,533
Any more questions?

558
00:54:03,633 --> 00:54:05,500
Yes sir, what do we use for the drag pit?

559
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,167
The VIP suite will be used for the drag.

560
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:10,100
But the main pit will be right here in this room

561
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,967
With all the furniture removed.

562
00:54:12,067 --> 00:54:14,600
You can heel in that other bedroom past the bathroom

563
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:17,200
That where Mr. Baradansky's standing.

564
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,967
Any more questions?

565
00:54:19,067 --> 00:54:20,300
Well that's it then.

566
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,067
The fighting starts at 10 AM in the morning.

567
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:24,567
Mimeograph schedules will be run off

568
00:54:24,667 --> 00:54:27,367
And slipped under your doors tonight.

569
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,700
Now if you gentlemen will give
me a list of all your weights,

570
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,467
Why, I'll get started on the matching.

571
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,633
Yeah, you're right, We could
lose our chickens an array.

572
00:54:55,733 --> 00:54:58,533
But we could get fat off those Nashville gamblers.

573
00:55:01,567 --> 00:55:04,167
Why don't you take our derby
birds on to Cook's Hollow.

574
00:55:04,267 --> 00:55:06,133
I'll take the other birds in a truck,

575
00:55:06,233 --> 00:55:07,600
Go to a motel outside of town, come

576
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,567
Back, do some gambling anyway.

577
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,700
I should have brought another handkerchief.

578
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,800
When I ask Fred Reed for that
entry fee back, he's gonna cry.

579
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:34,067
I see on the board, you'd looking for a 5.2 to fight.

580
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,267
Well, you give away an ounce, we got

581
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,167
A 5.3 I figure would take him.

582
00:55:39,267 --> 00:55:40,867
Mine, Mr. Mansfield.

583
00:55:40,967 --> 00:55:42,233
Little Joe.

584
00:55:42,333 --> 00:55:43,467
Ever hear tell of Little Joe?

585
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:44,967
All right, Mr. Mansfield hadn't fought in this neck

586
00:55:45,067 --> 00:55:46,567
Of the woods in some time, Tom.

587
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:50,433
Well, he's a six time winner.

588
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:52,600
Can't fight him here though, 'cause he's crowd shy,

589
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,133
But you come out to our place, and we

590
00:55:54,233 --> 00:55:56,467
Can give you a private hack.

591
00:55:56,567 --> 00:55:57,867
Tell you what.

592
00:55:57,967 --> 00:56:01,700
I'll give you two to one and,
and you can name the amount.

593
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,167
We ain't gonna... Little Joe just on $50, uh uh.

594
00:56:11,767 --> 00:56:12,600
$500.

595
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,733
And you gave him two to one.

596
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:16,833
Little Joe can take him, daddy.

597
00:56:16,933 --> 00:56:17,633
Hm.

598
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:26,233
You got yourself a bet.

599
00:56:26,333 --> 00:56:28,367
You just follow us on out whenever you're ready.

600
00:56:33,233 --> 00:56:34,367
Trick, Frank.

601
00:56:34,467 --> 00:56:37,733
People has gotta square of linoleum in his cockpit.

602
00:56:37,833 --> 00:56:39,767
He rubs rosin on Little Joe's feet,

603
00:56:39,867 --> 00:56:42,133
And on that slick wax surface, the other cock

604
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:45,300
Hasn't got a chance.

605
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,267
I got a chunk of rosin for you here.

606
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:51,367
That way at least you start
out even, except that Little

607
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:53,600
Joe's won at least 16 fights.

608
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,433
Leave the coops here and come back after it's

609
00:56:55,533 --> 00:56:56,633
All over if you want to.

610
00:57:23,933 --> 00:57:26,167
This is a stick up.

611
00:57:26,267 --> 00:57:29,200
Hands over your heads.

612
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,067
Anybody moves gets their head blasted off.

613
00:57:43,433 --> 00:57:46,300
You get that chicken?

614
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,800
You get those.

615
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:56,533
Get out of the pit and up against the wall.

616
00:58:15,067 --> 00:58:18,167
I'm just gonna say this once
and only once, so pay attention.

617
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:21,933
When I point this thing at
you, you pull down your pants,

618
00:58:22,067 --> 00:58:23,467
Throw them over there on that heap,

619
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,733
But not before I tell you to.

620
00:58:25,833 --> 00:58:27,133
Then put your hands back up over your head.

621
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,900
Keep your tobacco.

622
00:59:43,067 --> 00:59:43,700
Freeze!

623
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:29,000
I'll hold him for you, Mr. Mansfield.

624
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,567
Feels just like a baseball.

625
01:00:32,667 --> 01:00:34,133
It was a shame for Little Joe to kill a pretty

626
01:00:34,233 --> 01:00:36,967
Little chicken like this 'un.

627
01:00:37,067 --> 01:00:37,967
Shush, calm down.

628
01:00:47,033 --> 01:00:48,500
We just about finished, Mr. Mansfield.

629
01:01:06,967 --> 01:01:07,667
C'mon boy.

630
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,100
May as well let Tom be referee
is that's all right with you.

631
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,067
Let's... let's... let's bill
them a little, Mr. Mansfield.

632
01:01:30,967 --> 01:01:32,900
Oh, that Little Joe, he likes to fight.

633
01:01:33,067 --> 01:01:33,700
Flush 'em.

634
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,233
Get ready.

635
01:01:38,333 --> 01:01:39,067
Hit!

636
01:02:07,733 --> 01:02:11,433
You killed Little Joe!

637
01:02:11,533 --> 01:02:12,700
You killed him!

638
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:14,233
You killed him!

639
01:02:45,333 --> 01:02:49,067
Ah, you didn't have to hit him so hard, there,

640
01:02:49,167 --> 01:02:52,367
That Little Joe was his pet.

641
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:58,267
He had a right to be mad, losing him so quick, like.

642
01:02:58,367 --> 01:03:01,067
I'm, uh, little short a $1000, Mr. Mansfield,

643
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:03,067
But I'll give you $350 now, you've gotta

644
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,067
Take the rest of the game fowl.

645
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:09,067
We'll go on down to run, you can
pick yourself out six roosters.

646
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:10,800
Well, most of my stocke's all greys,

647
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,767
But I've got three Palmettos.

648
01:03:14,633 --> 01:03:18,233
You can't get no better cutters than Palmettos.

649
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,200
Oh, ten's all the stock I got.

650
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,767
You can't take all 10.

651
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:23,833
Aw, c'mon there.

652
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:55,200
Ah.

653
01:03:55,300 --> 01:03:58,267
You'd best not hold him under
that too long, Mr. Mansfield.

654
01:03:58,367 --> 01:03:59,700
He'll like to get drownded.

655
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:28,667
The champagne hour!

656
01:04:28,767 --> 01:04:32,233
Let's drink a toast!

657
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:34,367
To victory at Milledgeville!

658
01:04:48,333 --> 01:04:50,500
I wait, gentlemen.

659
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:54,733
Light passes this way but once,
notwithstanding the hinders.

660
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:57,700
And I say, celebrate a victory twice.

661
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:01,167
Once before the magic event, and once afterwards.

662
01:05:01,267 --> 01:05:03,133
A ritual is what it is.

663
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:04,600
Religious.

664
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,533
Mystical in it's power to invoke
the gods of lightning victory.

665
01:05:09,633 --> 01:05:14,267
As the top glass fills, it overflows into the next,

666
01:05:14,367 --> 01:05:18,400
And on down into eternity.

667
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:22,667
The mystical realm of the great cock.

668
01:05:22,767 --> 01:05:26,833
A monument.

669
01:05:29,767 --> 01:05:33,733
To all, all American cock fighters.

670
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:36,300
A hearty salute.

671
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:39,500
The Anglo-Polish team of Mansfield and Baradansky

672
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,300
Salute you.

673
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,800
Gentlemen!

674
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:44,467
Cocksmen!

675
01:05:44,567 --> 01:05:46,533
Into the faith!

676
01:05:46,633 --> 01:05:47,700
Milledgeville!

677
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:48,500
Ah!

678
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:14,467
Senator Vauxhall awarded the medal to

679
01:06:14,567 --> 01:06:16,067
The man he thought deserved it.

680
01:06:16,133 --> 01:06:18,067
You didn't have to win the
tourny to get the Cockfighter

681
01:06:18,133 --> 01:06:19,800
Of the Year Award.

682
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,067
The senator hadn't given the award

683
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:22,633
To anybody in three years.

684
01:06:22,733 --> 01:06:24,233
And it was possible that he wouldn't

685
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:26,633
Give the medal again this year.

686
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,300
I didn't think want to think about it.

687
01:06:58,433 --> 01:07:00,700
Your room will be assigned to you up at the house.

688
01:07:00,800 --> 01:07:05,100
There's someone mighty anxious to see you up there.

689
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,067
Well you go ahead, Frank, I'll unlock.

690
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:13,600
I've never seen someone so
anxious to see Mr. Middleton.

691
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,300
Ed Middleton?

692
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:17,567
Frank though you meant his fiance.

693
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:32,233
Frank.

694
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:35,400
You didn't expect to see me here did you?

695
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,800
Well I'm not here as any spectator.

696
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:38,167
I'm chief referee.

697
01:07:38,267 --> 01:07:41,800
And don't think I won't be
watching every move you make.

698
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,367
You know, I uh, promised Martha I'd quit,

699
01:07:44,467 --> 01:07:47,200
But Milledgeville only comes once a year, so she

700
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,067
Slipped my car for a few days.

701
01:07:49,133 --> 01:07:51,800
Say, uh, you've got a partner now.

702
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:54,100
I guess I'll have to ask him
how my little white chicken's

703
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,067
Getting along.

704
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,500
C'mon, I'll buy you a drink.

705
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,633
Another thing I want to know is, how

706
01:07:58,733 --> 01:08:02,067
Come they didn't catch you with
your pants down in Chattanooga?

707
01:08:02,167 --> 01:08:03,333
It looks good, Frank.

708
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:05,067
You're gonna win the cockfighter of the year medal.

709
01:08:20,167 --> 01:08:21,500
Oh you don't have to go downtown.

710
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,667
I'll phone down for the hotel
reservations for Mary Elizabeth

711
01:08:23,767 --> 01:08:26,700
If you want me to.

712
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,500
Hey Frank.

713
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:32,700
No matter how we come out tomorrow,

714
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,567
I'll always be grateful to
you for getting me this far.

715
01:08:58,133 --> 01:08:58,833
Frank?

716
01:08:58,933 --> 01:08:59,800
Talk to you a minute?

717
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,267
Hey pal, let's... let's make
the bet an even $1000 between

718
01:09:07,367 --> 01:09:09,067
Little David and your chickie.

719
01:09:09,133 --> 01:09:10,600
Ed and Pete's OK as long as we tally the score.

720
01:09:24,733 --> 01:09:26,133
Frank?

721
01:09:26,233 --> 01:09:28,067
Jack said I had to apologize to you.

722
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,467
Frank's partner, Senator.

723
01:09:40,567 --> 01:09:41,600
Mr. Baradansky.

724
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:42,567
Oh yes.

725
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,700
Russian, are you, Mr. Baradansky?

726
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:45,633
Uh, no.

727
01:09:45,733 --> 01:09:46,933
Polish.

728
01:09:47,067 --> 01:09:48,300
You look Russian.

729
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:51,600
Well anyway, you're in good
hands with Frank Mansfield.

730
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:53,100
I knew Frank's granddad.

731
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,900
And if you listen to Frank, Mr. Baradansky,

732
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:57,933
You'll learn a lot about the game fowl business.

733
01:09:58,067 --> 01:09:59,267
Isn't that right, Ed?

734
01:09:59,367 --> 01:10:01,200
Frank could teach us a lot of things,

735
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,233
If he won't have to say them.

736
01:10:03,333 --> 01:10:04,667
That's what I mean.

737
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:07,667
General Severus, before he invaded Great Britain,

738
01:10:07,767 --> 01:10:11,067
Made his Roman legion watch
cock fights for three days.

739
01:10:11,167 --> 01:10:12,300
The example was enough.

740
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,000
Dinner is served.

741
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:20,900
They don't feed game fowl
right in Poland, Mr. Baradansky.

742
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:25,767
Game cocks can't fight on raw potatoes.

743
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:28,167
I'll keep that in mind.

744
01:10:33,133 --> 01:10:34,967
Four generations in Evanston, he talks to me

745
01:10:35,067 --> 01:10:36,067
Like I just got off the boat.

746
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,333
Ladies and gentlemen.

747
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:50,033
Welcome to the Southern Conference tourny.

748
01:10:50,133 --> 01:10:53,200
And we want all of you to have a good time.

749
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,833
There's only one rule.

750
01:10:55,933 --> 01:10:58,633
Conduct yourselves as ladies and gentlemen.

751
01:10:58,733 --> 01:11:01,300
Uh, before the tourny's over, you may

752
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,067
Want to place a small wager.

753
01:11:04,167 --> 01:11:07,700
Know who you bet with, because
there may be internal revenue

754
01:11:07,800 --> 01:11:09,033
Agents in the crowd.

755
01:11:11,833 --> 01:11:13,067
I'll take $100 on the red bill.

756
01:11:13,167 --> 01:11:15,667
One more $100, now get in.

757
01:11:16,167 --> 01:11:19,033
Hit.

758
01:11:31,967 --> 01:11:32,667
Handle.

759
01:11:40,067 --> 01:11:40,967
Ready, hit.

760
01:11:44,733 --> 01:11:45,467
Handle.

761
01:11:48,367 --> 01:11:50,100
Get ready.

762
01:11:50,200 --> 01:11:51,567
Hit.

763
01:11:51,667 --> 01:11:52,700
Hit.

764
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:53,500
Handle.

765
01:11:58,967 --> 01:11:59,667
Hit.

766
01:12:06,033 --> 01:12:06,733
Handle.

767
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,533
Let's go to the drag pit.

768
01:12:12,633 --> 01:12:14,600
Looks like this one's going to drag on all day.

769
01:12:35,633 --> 01:12:36,333
All right.

770
01:12:42,367 --> 01:12:43,067
Hit.

771
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,033
Get ready.

772
01:12:55,133 --> 01:12:57,033
Hit.

773
01:12:57,133 --> 01:13:01,033
I'm referee in this fight, Mr. Mansfield.

774
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:02,033
Get ready.

775
01:13:12,533 --> 01:13:13,267
C'mon, grey.

776
01:13:13,467 --> 01:13:14,667
Number five wins.

777
01:13:14,767 --> 01:13:15,933
I commit some kind of a foul?

778
01:13:16,033 --> 01:13:17,200
We're pushing on the center score.

779
01:13:17,300 --> 01:13:19,600
The first time I wasn't sure.

780
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,267
Nor the second, when number five whistled.

781
01:13:21,367 --> 01:13:23,600
But the third time it was obvious.

782
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:25,333
Didn't you gentlemen see him push?

783
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,933
Are you arguing with my decision?

784
01:13:27,033 --> 01:13:28,800
You damn right, I am.

785
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,800
That's a $50 fine.

786
01:13:30,900 --> 01:13:33,600
Anything else?

787
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:34,467
Will you take a check?

788
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:52,467
Hey Frank.

789
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,133
We're due in the pit in less than five minutes.

790
01:13:54,233 --> 01:13:55,633
You wanna handle?

791
01:14:49,233 --> 01:14:50,867
So far, it looks pretty even.

792
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:53,333
You think we'll win tomorrow?

793
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:27,033
Well, you wanna raise the bets two thousand?

794
01:15:27,133 --> 01:15:30,267
If you five us two to one odds, we will.

795
01:15:30,367 --> 01:15:32,833
David's been on a country walk all season.

796
01:15:32,933 --> 01:15:35,533
White Lightning here's has to fight just to qualify.

797
01:15:35,633 --> 01:15:36,867
You asking for odds, Frank?

798
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:49,367
While the final results of
the tourny are being tabulated,

799
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:55,000
There'll be an extra hack
between entries four and five.

800
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:02,667
Both 5.2, Peach.

801
01:16:02,767 --> 01:16:07,200
Both birds are 5.2 and they'll fight in short heels.

802
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:09,167
All right, let's fill 'em.

803
01:16:09,267 --> 01:16:10,167
I got $20 on the white!

804
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:19,167
Get ready.

805
01:16:32,867 --> 01:16:33,567
Handle.

806
01:16:33,667 --> 01:16:34,367
Handle.

807
01:16:53,967 --> 01:16:54,833
Get ready.

808
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,767
Hit.

809
01:17:11,233 --> 01:17:12,100
Get him, red!

810
01:17:16,467 --> 01:17:17,100
Handle.

811
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:19,600
Handle.

812
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:20,600
Watch that rough handling.

813
01:17:33,167 --> 01:17:33,867
Get ready.

814
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:55,467
Handle Handle.

815
01:18:11,833 --> 01:18:12,967
Get ready.

816
01:18:13,067 --> 01:18:13,833
Hit.

817
01:18:55,567 --> 01:18:57,700
Get ready.

818
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,867
One handling the bird only.

819
01:19:00,967 --> 01:19:01,667
Hit.

820
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,367
Count.

821
01:19:06,467 --> 01:19:07,233
Count's going on?

822
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:17,267
That's what I call a dead game chicken, Frank.

823
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,667
One for Mr. Mansfield.

824
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:24,733
I'm picking up, Ed, my rooster's dead.

825
01:19:24,833 --> 01:19:26,567
Hell they're both dead, but you're still

826
01:19:26,667 --> 01:19:27,867
Entitled to two more counts.

827
01:19:27,967 --> 01:19:29,467
Oh Jesus.

828
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:30,200
Get ready.

829
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:31,167
I'm carrying out.

830
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:37,600
The winner... Mr. Mansfield.

831
01:20:13,467 --> 01:20:15,333
That's close enough.

832
01:20:15,433 --> 01:20:18,367
I don't want you to touch me, ever.

833
01:20:18,467 --> 01:20:21,767
I should have watched you in the ring long ago.

834
01:20:21,867 --> 01:20:23,600
You are not the man I fell in love with.

835
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:24,933
Now I know you never were.

836
01:20:28,733 --> 01:20:30,200
I didn't watch those poor chickens fighting,

837
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:32,267
I watched your face.

838
01:20:32,367 --> 01:20:34,933
No pity, no love, nothing.

839
01:20:35,033 --> 01:20:38,700
I think that bird has more of a
heart than you ever will have.

840
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,167
He sure as hell has more of a voice.

841
01:21:25,467 --> 01:21:27,233
Thank you.

842
01:21:27,333 --> 01:21:29,467
If this is your substitute for a heart,

843
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,333
At least it'll serve to remind me

844
01:21:31,467 --> 01:21:33,200
What a damn fool I have been.

845
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:38,967
Hey Frank, Frank.

846
01:21:39,067 --> 01:21:40,367
Did you hear the announcement?

847
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:43,467
Senator Vauxhall just awarded
you cockfighter of the year!

848
01:21:43,567 --> 01:21:44,867
C'mon, let's hustle.

849
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:48,067
As your partner, I'm entitled
to a little reflected glory.

850
01:21:48,167 --> 01:21:50,600
Maybe you can sleep with your medal, Frank.

851
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:52,033
And eat it all at the same time.

852
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:57,367
Maybe it'll give you some comfort in your old age.

853
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:09,133
Everything all right between you and her?

854
01:22:11,467 --> 01:22:12,133
She loves me, Omar.

855
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:20,467
You go collect the winnings,
and I'll go get that medal.
