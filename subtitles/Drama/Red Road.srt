1
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,375
Good night.

2
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,809
Going somewhere nice?
It's Friday night.

3
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,408
You know me, Angus.
Party animal.

4
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,576
- See you Sunday.
- See you later.

5
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,535
Knock, knock.

6
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,415
How did you get in?

7
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,768
Frank let me in.

8
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,652
My shift's not over for an hour yet.

9
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,897
I know, I was hoping
you could sneak away a bit early.

10
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:18,649
I've got two new buildings to fit in.
Frank said he'd take over for you.

11
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,179
Didn't you, Frank?

12
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,973
I came in to make copies of
that mugging. I can do it later.

13
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,819
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. You go and enjoy yourself.

14
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:28,738
Thanks, Frank.
You're a pal, I'll pay you back.

15
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,855
You see it all here, don't you?
Report that dog!

16
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,255
Don't. It's not well.

17
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,413
What's that?

18
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,053
Pull it.

19
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,737
My son gave it to me.

20
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,770
Oh, God. Oh...

21
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,572
Oh, sorry, I can't help it.

22
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,778
It was a bit quick, sorry.

23
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,568
Did you...?

24
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,497
Yeah, earlier.

25
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,099
I can never tell.

26
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,019
Prince!

27
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,333
Now!

28
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,049
- See you in two weeks, then?
- Yeah.

29
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,295
Smile!

30
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,937
Here they come.

31
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,491
You made it!

32
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,735
You look great.

33
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,652
Jackie, this is Rob.
Rob, this is my sister-in-law,

34
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,735
Jackie.

35
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,816
Pleased to meet you.

36
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,374
I am so glad you made it, Jackie.

37
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,055
Go on, then.

38
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,533
Get up and dance.

39
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,649
I'm a rubbish dancer.

40
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,340
Bollocks! You danced all night
at your own wedding.

41
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,251
You're right, I did.
But not very well.

42
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:28,292
Maybe later.
I tell you what, I will if you will.

43
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,570
I've got osteoporosis.
You want me to break in two?

44
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,130
- Do you want another trifle?
- Sherry?

45
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,377
Go on, then. I will if you will.
We'll be bloody dead soon.

46
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,618
Hello, Alfred.

47
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,650
Jackie.

48
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,610
How are you?

49
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,618
You look different.

50
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,617
You had your hair done?

51
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,059
Ages ago.

52
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,614
I liked it longer.

53
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,093
Sorry I haven't been over.

54
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,419
It was down to your waist
the first time we met you.

55
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,290
He was happy that day,

56
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:15,376
compared to the last time I saw him.

57
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,297
He brought the bairn over

58
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,297
to give you a break.

59
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,090
I was getting Aunt Kath some trifle.
Can I get you anything?

60
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,016
No, thanks.

61
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:33,696
Alfred.

62
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,697
My beer's getting cold.

63
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,614
Jackie!

64
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,571
You're not leaving already, are you?

65
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,533
I was gonna say goodbye
but you were dancing.

66
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,252
Is it Dad?

67
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,052
No, I've got work tomorrow.

68
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,494
You know what's bugging him, eh?

69
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,292
I know.

70
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,928
If they were buried...

71
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,539
I know.

72
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,813
He looks nice, your Rob.

73
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,289
I'll see you.

74
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,217
OK, OK, come on.

75
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,128
It's been a tough old day.
Come on home and get some medicine.

76
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,739
Good girl.

77
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:36,735
Come on.

78
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,617
Come here.

79
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,571
She's by the Jet garage
in Barmulloch, by the top shops.

80
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,370
I don't know.

81
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,933
Twenties?

82
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,775
I'll keep her in sight
till you get there.

83
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,976
She shouldn't spend the night there.

84
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,575
OK.

85
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,816
Hello, this is City Eye control room,

86
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,975
division E.

87
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:26,572
I've an incident
behind the Jet garage...

88
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,175
Hold on.

89
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,376
Sorry, forget it. False alarm.

90
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,729
- Angus, got any fags?
- I thought you'd given up.

91
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:23,018
I have.

92
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,939
Hi, Angus. It's me.

93
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,973
Yeah, you can.

94
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:20,976
The Red Road flats.

95
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,012
Am I right in thinking they house
a lot of ex-prisoners in those flats?

96
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,930
No, I just wondered.

97
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,130
OK. Thanks.

98
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,778
Hello?

99
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,454
Yeah. You got my messages?

100
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:57,012
Well, I'm sure I saw him, but it's
not possible, is it? It's not time.

101
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,052
OK.

102
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,610
If you could.

103
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,492
Thanks.

104
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,858
<i>Jackie, it's Stuart Kincaid.</i>

105
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,130
<i>I looked into things for you.</i>

106
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,093
<i>There's not much else
to add, I'm afraid.</i>

107
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,017
<i>He got early release
for good behavior.</i>

108
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,937
<i>Very sorry. It happens.</i>

109
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,699
<i>As consolation,
he'll be back in like a shot</i>

110
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,651
<i>if he messes up.</i>

111
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,090
<i>Call me if I can help.
Bye for now.</i>

112
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,777
Frank, can I ask you a big favor?

113
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,892
You, Jackie, can ask me anything.

114
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,251
See this guy?

115
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,894
He lives in Red Road
in the main block.

116
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,454
He's older now,
about six years or so.

117
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:57,971
If you see him doing anything odd,
could you let me know?

118
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,290
- I won't ask.
- I'm sorry, Frank. Thanks.

119
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,098
Is this 24-Hour Locksmiths?

120
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,176
Do you have someone called
Clyde Henderson working for you?

121
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,416
Did you do a police check on him?

122
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,292
Doesn't matter who I am.

123
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,454
Shit.

124
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,810
Christ.

125
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,170
Hello, this is City Eye control room.

126
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,858
Ambulance needed:

127
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,574
Kirkland Drive.
It's urgent, please hurry.

128
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,776
It looks like a stabbing.
A young girl.

129
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,016
The girls are cutting
through the flats

130
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,539
at the back of Kirkland Drive.

131
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,732
There are several girls.
White, aged about 14.

132
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,818
Look like they're from
the Petershill school.

133
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,215
OK. I'm here.

134
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,619
Have you heard anything?

135
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,490
She lost a lot of blood.

136
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,496
Knife just missed her heart.

137
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,814
My God.

138
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:14,215
- But she'll make it, apparently.
- Really?

139
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,171
- So they say.
- Are you sure?

140
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,370
She was lucky.

141
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,570
Not so lucky.

142
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,459
The tape's gone off.
Just hope they get the wee bastards.

143
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:43,737
Angus, I may as well tell you now,
I never got close-ups of the girls.

144
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,215
That's not like you.

145
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:50,458
I'm sorry. I was watching someone
else. I didn't see it coming.

146
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,619
It happens.

147
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,208
Can't get them every time.

148
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:28,208
- Not even a fucking fiver?
- I won't get it back, that's why.

149
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,410
- Fuck you, you prick.
- Fuck yourself.

150
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,897
You can be a right fucking wanker.
You can't even lend me a fiver.

151
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,009
Excuse me. Excuse me.

152
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:14,619
Excuse me, ladies.

153
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:19,131
Do you have any 20-pence pieces?

154
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,296
It's for the laundry, aye.

155
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,053
Just put your money in
and press buttons, just like guys do.

156
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,455
Thanks, sweetheart. Cheers.

157
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:45,655
What can I get you?

158
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,930
Mug of tea, please.

159
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,293
- Milk?
- Yes, please.

160
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,173
- Sugar?
- No, thanks.

161
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,575
- 50p, please.
- Ta.

162
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,372
Thanks.

163
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,974
Don't say I don't look after you.

164
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,818
Do I not look grateful?

165
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,578
Not enough, in my book.

166
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,770
I'll have to show you later.

167
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,736
Give us a fag.

168
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,532
- So what's happening Saturday?
- Nothing.

169
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,652
Kim from the pub said you
were having people round on Saturday.

170
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:53,613
Did she?
Where did she get that idea?

171
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,777
You're a fucking animal.

172
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,050
Kim's dad'll belt you.

173
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,170
Hi.

174
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,494
I'm looking for someone...

175
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:13,810
I'm not sure which floor he's in.

176
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:14,895
It's Clyde Henderson.

177
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,499
I can't give you that information.

178
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,770
- I'm not allowed.
- Right.

179
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,253
You going to the party?

180
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,972
Yeah.

181
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,374
Who invited you?

182
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,813
I know Clyde.

183
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,579
What woman round here doesn't?
He's a dirty cunt.

184
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,019
Do you like it?

185
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,492
Watch the fucking dog!

186
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,936
I can't work this thing.

187
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,369
Jesus Christ,
you'll cut the fucking head off.

188
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,855
- Is he your boyfriend?
- Stevie?

189
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:51,254
Why? Do you fancy him?

190
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:52,608
No!

191
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:57,849
Did he get you the dog?

192
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,936
Yeah. He's sweet.

193
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:02,534
You're a really pretty girl.

194
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,537
Where are you from?

195
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,854
London.

196
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,096
What are you doing in Scotland?

197
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,575
I came here to see someone,

198
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,338
but it didn't work out.

199
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:32,695
A boyfriend?

200
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,609
No.

201
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,373
There he goes.

202
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:45,452
- You looking for the toilet?
- Yeah.

203
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,048
- It's by the kitchen.
- Thanks.

204
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,774
Have we met?

205
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,252
I saw you in the café.

206
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,132
Aye.

207
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,978
The café. I remember.

208
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,379
Come here.

209
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,729
- I should go.
- Where?

210
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,090
- Home.
- You just got here.

211
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,255
Wait.

212
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:29,776
Tom, I'm following someone
who's heading for Spring Hill.

213
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:32,858
If you give me a description
I'll look out for him for you.

214
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,289
I'd like to do it myself
if that's all right.

215
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:37,297
OK, no problem.

216
00:53:02,161 --> 00:53:03,310
Alfred?

217
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:10,075
I had to go up to the hospital.
It's on the way.

218
00:53:24,321 --> 00:53:25,310
Coming in, then?

219
00:53:27,161 --> 00:53:28,560
I haven't got long.

220
00:53:28,681 --> 00:53:31,320
Brenda doesn't know I'm stopping.
I didn't tell her.

221
00:53:37,201 --> 00:53:38,475
You've never been here before?

222
00:53:40,161 --> 00:53:41,594
Yeah. A few times

223
00:53:41,721 --> 00:53:43,074
when you first moved in.

224
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,634
We sat in the garden.

225
00:53:46,321 --> 00:53:48,391
Brenda brought you a plum tree.

226
00:53:48,521 --> 00:53:49,510
You said

227
00:53:49,641 --> 00:53:51,950
a plum tree wouldn't grow in Glasgow,
if I remember.

228
00:53:52,081 --> 00:53:53,958
Too wet.

229
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:56,153
I don't remember saying that.

230
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:57,789
It was shortly after the...

231
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:14,199
- It's stiff, pull it.
- I can manage.

232
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:30,431
Look...

233
00:54:31,881 --> 00:54:33,633
I'm not looking for sympathy.

234
00:54:33,761 --> 00:54:34,876
Far from it.

235
00:54:35,001 --> 00:54:36,150
I've got a lump.

236
00:54:37,361 --> 00:54:40,592
Might be nothing, but I'm getting on
and you never can tell.

237
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:46,394
You can't deny us any longer.

238
00:54:46,521 --> 00:54:50,150
We have a right to say goodbye to him
properly. That's all I wanted to say.

239
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:02,638
Alfred, can I say something?

240
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,118
I want them here with me.

241
00:55:07,001 --> 00:55:09,276
It'd feel wrong
to have them anywhere else.

242
00:55:09,401 --> 00:55:11,631
You've got Brenda.
Can you understand?

243
00:55:15,641 --> 00:55:16,869
This garden was nice

244
00:55:17,001 --> 00:55:18,150
when you moved in.

245
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:19,680
It needs seeing to.

246
00:55:20,441 --> 00:55:21,351
You've let it go.

247
00:56:12,281 --> 00:56:13,680
<i>Who is it?</i>

248
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:14,790
Clyde?

249
00:56:14,921 --> 00:56:16,559
<i>He's not in.</i>

250
00:56:16,681 --> 00:56:18,353
Is that Stevie?

251
00:56:18,481 --> 00:56:20,153
<i>Who's this?</i>

252
00:56:20,281 --> 00:56:21,760
When's he back?

253
00:56:21,881 --> 00:56:23,473
<i>Fuck knows. Who is it?</i>

254
00:56:23,601 --> 00:56:25,592
Can I leave something for him?

255
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:27,120
<i>What?</i>

256
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:28,469
Whisky.

257
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:40,593
Hiya.

258
00:56:41,881 --> 00:56:43,997
I was at the party.

259
00:56:44,121 --> 00:56:47,591
You're the bird
that knocked Clyde back, aren't you?

260
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:51,316
- Do you want a drink?
- Come in.

261
00:56:55,081 --> 00:56:57,549
April, darling,
do you want a drink?

262
00:56:58,681 --> 00:57:00,956
Just go in the front.

263
00:57:09,881 --> 00:57:10,791
April.

264
00:57:12,161 --> 00:57:13,992
Lazy bastard.
Wake up.

265
00:57:15,481 --> 00:57:18,120
- Here, sit yourself here.
- All right?

266
00:57:20,721 --> 00:57:22,871
Are you not going back
to London, then?

267
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:24,480
No.

268
00:57:26,041 --> 00:57:28,157
Clyde's out.

269
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:30,556
I know.
I'm gonna wait for him.

270
00:57:32,321 --> 00:57:34,596
I'll put on some jeans.

271
00:57:34,721 --> 00:57:36,791
It's getting cold.

272
00:57:37,881 --> 00:57:41,157
We were wondering how we'd
get through tonight. We're all skint.

273
00:57:41,281 --> 00:57:43,351
Help yourself.

274
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:49,636
Ta.

275
00:57:59,361 --> 00:58:01,397
That's some view.

276
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:02,317
Eh?

277
00:58:02,441 --> 00:58:03,840
Some view you've got.

278
00:58:03,961 --> 00:58:05,519
It's all right, isn't it?

279
00:58:18,041 --> 00:58:19,599
So where is Clyde?

280
00:58:19,721 --> 00:58:21,996
Fuck knows. Trying to get work.

281
00:58:22,121 --> 00:58:26,160
Thinks if he paints his number
on the van people'll phone for work.

282
00:58:26,881 --> 00:58:31,159
Had one phone call in three weeks -
it was the wrong fucking number.

283
00:58:34,121 --> 00:58:36,271
Sit down.

284
00:58:36,401 --> 00:58:38,596
Cheers. You don't want to sit here?

285
00:58:38,721 --> 00:58:40,393
No.

286
00:58:41,481 --> 00:58:43,756
How do you know him, anyway?

287
00:58:45,721 --> 00:58:48,713
We just met

288
00:58:48,841 --> 00:58:49,956
along the road.

289
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:54,870
Outside the flat?

290
00:58:56,241 --> 00:58:58,391
Just at the pub.

291
00:59:00,281 --> 00:59:02,033
He's charming
for a ginger cunt.

292
00:59:04,321 --> 00:59:05,674
He's some guy.

293
00:59:05,801 --> 00:59:08,110
Aye, you can say that again.

294
00:59:09,121 --> 00:59:13,478
I'm surprised he's not tempted
to do what he did before.

295
00:59:13,601 --> 00:59:15,876
What would that be?

296
00:59:17,401 --> 00:59:19,961
Just all his dodgy stuff.

297
00:59:22,921 --> 00:59:24,912
What's your name?

298
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:28,595
Who the fuck wants to hire
a locksmith who's been in jail?

299
00:59:35,401 --> 00:59:36,629
So what's with the whisky?

300
00:59:36,761 --> 00:59:38,399
Is that a make-up thing, like?

301
00:59:39,761 --> 00:59:40,796
A make-up thing?

302
00:59:40,921 --> 00:59:42,320
He was raging when you left.

303
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:46,477
I guess so.

304
00:59:46,601 --> 00:59:48,671
You want to feel the wind?

305
00:59:48,801 --> 00:59:50,075
Feel what?

306
00:59:50,201 --> 00:59:52,635
The wind up here's fucking brilliant.

307
00:59:52,761 --> 00:59:53,796
Come on, I'll show you.

308
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:54,990
April, come here, babe.

309
00:59:56,401 --> 00:59:58,551
Your purse.
Come here a minute.

310
00:59:58,681 --> 01:00:01,070
Come here. I'll show you.

311
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:06,714
Come here a minute.

312
01:00:08,401 --> 01:00:10,039
Come here, babe.

313
01:00:12,481 --> 01:00:15,439
Here. Right in. Right.

314
01:00:15,561 --> 01:00:16,960
You need to get right in.

315
01:00:17,081 --> 01:00:18,036
Ready?

316
01:00:27,481 --> 01:00:29,199
- Fucking quality.
- It's quite high.

317
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:39,797
Oh, God!

318
01:00:40,561 --> 01:00:41,710
Put her down.

319
01:00:43,601 --> 01:00:44,511
You all right?

320
01:00:45,361 --> 01:00:47,033
April, I was having a laugh with you.

321
01:00:47,161 --> 01:00:48,560
Wasn't fucking funny.

322
01:00:49,641 --> 01:00:50,630
You scared her.

323
01:00:50,761 --> 01:00:54,117
What the fuck do you mean?
I wasn't going to drop her, was I?

324
01:00:59,321 --> 01:01:01,516
- I think you'd better go.
- Yeah.

325
01:01:01,641 --> 01:01:04,235
So who will I say come round?

326
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:06,716
It's cool. I'll give him a call.

327
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:08,710
I'll just say

328
01:01:08,841 --> 01:01:10,513
the bird with the nice arse,
he calls you.

329
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:12,757
April,

330
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:13,791
come here a minute.

331
01:01:29,361 --> 01:01:31,795
Sorry, I can't find my purse.

332
01:03:29,881 --> 01:03:31,599
Shit.

333
01:03:34,241 --> 01:03:35,913
Thieving little...

334
01:04:26,121 --> 01:04:27,520
Hi, Angus.

335
01:04:27,641 --> 01:04:28,835
It's Jackie.

336
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:30,280
Sorry,
I'm not feeling well.

337
01:04:31,201 --> 01:04:33,237
Would you get
somebody to cover for me?

338
01:04:36,161 --> 01:04:37,560
OK.

339
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:38,750
Bye.

340
01:06:36,881 --> 01:06:38,758
Are you lost?

341
01:06:39,281 --> 01:06:40,953
No, I'm all right.

342
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,878
- Glass of wine, please.
- Certainly.

343
01:06:48,601 --> 01:06:49,795
Is that all?

344
01:06:49,921 --> 01:06:51,877
- Yeah, thanks.
- That'll be 1 .75, please.

345
01:06:58,481 --> 01:07:00,073
8.25 change, there. Right.

346
01:07:00,201 --> 01:07:02,032
Thanks very much.
Enjoy your drink.

347
01:07:55,841 --> 01:07:58,116
I heard you came looking for me.

348
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:04,392
- I did.
- That's nice.

349
01:08:05,841 --> 01:08:07,354
Cos I've been
thinking about you.

350
01:08:08,721 --> 01:08:09,471
Oh, yeah?

351
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,681
I have this feeling
that I've met you before.

352
01:08:15,201 --> 01:08:17,556
Is that right?

353
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:19,399
But I can't work it out.

354
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:25,510
Look at me.

355
01:08:26,441 --> 01:08:27,920
I need you to look at me.

356
01:08:35,041 --> 01:08:36,394
So, let me think.

357
01:08:38,401 --> 01:08:39,880
Do you live round here?

358
01:08:41,641 --> 01:08:42,596
Where do you live?

359
01:08:44,481 --> 01:08:45,675
Maryhill.

360
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:47,595
So what you doing here?

361
01:08:47,721 --> 01:08:49,598
I'm meeting a friend.

362
01:08:52,081 --> 01:08:53,958
Where is she?

363
01:08:56,561 --> 01:08:58,597
How do you know it's a she?

364
01:08:58,721 --> 01:09:00,951
Is it a boyfriend, then?

365
01:09:01,481 --> 01:09:04,200
No. A friend.

366
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:07,716
Where is your friend?

367
01:09:10,001 --> 01:09:13,152
I don't know. Late, I guess.

368
01:09:14,681 --> 01:09:17,434
So we can get to know each other
while you're waiting.

369
01:09:20,681 --> 01:09:22,478
I've also been thinking other things.

370
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:25,916
Do you want to know
what I've been thinking?

371
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:28,876
Ask me.

372
01:09:31,961 --> 01:09:34,236
What have you been thinking?

373
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:37,832
What your cunt tastes like.

374
01:09:41,681 --> 01:09:42,511
Are you shocked?

375
01:09:42,641 --> 01:09:44,233
No. Nothing much shocks me.

376
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:45,796
Did you like me saying it?

377
01:09:48,121 --> 01:09:50,157
I've also been thinking a lot
about you.

378
01:09:50,281 --> 01:09:51,111
That's good.

379
01:09:53,841 --> 01:09:56,071
You've had an interesting life.

380
01:10:01,161 --> 01:10:03,356
Who's been telling you about my life?

381
01:10:03,481 --> 01:10:04,709
Stevie.

382
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:06,513
He doesn't know shit about my life.

383
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:12,950
You've lived a certain way.
You've done stuff.

384
01:10:14,241 --> 01:10:16,801
You live on the edge.

385
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:20,430
Is that right?
Do I look like I do?

386
01:10:21,401 --> 01:10:22,356
Do you?

387
01:10:26,481 --> 01:10:27,311
Clyde!

388
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:29,874
Where have you been hiding?

389
01:10:31,121 --> 01:10:33,555
With that wee tight arse on you.

390
01:10:34,721 --> 01:10:35,995
Don't go away.

391
01:10:36,121 --> 01:10:37,873
You haven't got the guts.

392
01:10:39,881 --> 01:10:41,712
Calm down, you cunt.

393
01:10:43,441 --> 01:10:45,238
Don't you fucking hit me.

394
01:10:45,361 --> 01:10:46,555
Fucking calm down.

395
01:10:48,881 --> 01:10:50,599
Fucking relax.

396
01:10:52,121 --> 01:10:53,952
You all right?

397
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:55,594
That tart there's your girl?

398
01:10:55,721 --> 01:10:56,631
Fucking walk away.

399
01:10:57,361 --> 01:10:59,556
Fucking come here.

400
01:11:00,561 --> 01:11:02,916
What the fuck...? Stevie!

401
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:18,400
Are you all right?

402
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:19,715
Fuck off, you cow.

403
01:11:19,841 --> 01:11:20,990
No, you fuck off.

404
01:11:41,121 --> 01:11:42,998
Get off me.

405
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:48,951
Leave me.

406
01:11:49,081 --> 01:11:50,958
Fucking leave me. Leave me.

407
01:11:51,081 --> 01:11:52,833
Stevie, enough.

408
01:11:52,961 --> 01:11:53,950
He had it coming.

409
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:57,039
Your problems seem to follow me
fucking everywhere.

410
01:11:57,161 --> 01:11:59,231
What the fuck
was that all about, man?

411
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,476
It was his dad.

412
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:01,511
What?

413
01:12:01,641 --> 01:12:02,835
It was his dad.

414
01:12:04,801 --> 01:12:06,234
Was that your old man?

415
01:12:07,201 --> 01:12:08,111
Was it?

416
01:12:09,361 --> 01:12:12,114
Come here. Come here.
Take it easy, mate.

417
01:12:12,241 --> 01:12:13,435
You're all right.

418
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:14,994
Can we go home?

419
01:12:17,601 --> 01:12:20,593
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

420
01:12:24,081 --> 01:12:25,912
Just go up the road.

421
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,316
Are you all right?

422
01:12:41,921 --> 01:12:43,991
You all right?

423
01:12:46,441 --> 01:12:47,430
Want another drink?

424
01:12:48,121 --> 01:12:49,270
No, I should go.

425
01:12:49,401 --> 01:12:51,517
Come on,
don't be put off by all that shit.

426
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:54,311
Do you want a fag?
Here, take a fag.

427
01:12:57,521 --> 01:12:58,158
Here.

428
01:13:00,801 --> 01:13:03,361
Do you want to go for another beer?
I'm buying.

429
01:13:09,721 --> 01:13:14,112
Did I ever mention to you that when
I was young I wanted to be a fireman?

430
01:13:14,601 --> 01:13:16,398
I never told you that, did I?

431
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:21,792
Come here.

432
01:13:21,921 --> 01:13:23,991
Put me down.

433
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,631
No. Let me down!

434
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:28,398
Come on.

435
01:13:28,521 --> 01:13:31,433
- Let me down!
- I'll take you up the road. Come on.

436
01:13:38,321 --> 01:13:39,276
Don't go anywhere.

437
01:14:16,401 --> 01:14:17,311
April...

438
01:14:18,281 --> 01:14:20,431
- Yeah?
- Sorry about the fight.

439
01:14:20,561 --> 01:14:23,075
It's all right.
Don't fuss, honest.

440
01:14:23,201 --> 01:14:24,600
Did you have a good night?

441
01:14:25,881 --> 01:14:26,791
Yeah.

442
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:28,559
It was nice to go out.

443
01:14:29,721 --> 01:14:32,281
- You're not just saying that?
- No.

444
01:14:33,321 --> 01:14:35,198
I wish we had money all the time.

445
01:14:37,601 --> 01:14:38,317
April...

446
01:14:39,201 --> 01:14:40,111
Yeah?

447
01:14:41,441 --> 01:14:42,874
Do you like me?

448
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:45,791
Yeah.

449
01:14:47,121 --> 01:14:48,918
You're sweet.

450
01:14:59,041 --> 01:15:00,235
Night, then.

451
01:15:01,041 --> 01:15:03,271
- You not having a drink with us?
- No.

452
01:15:04,321 --> 01:15:05,310
I'm gonna have a wash

453
01:15:05,441 --> 01:15:06,920
and get to bed.

454
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:09,032
Let's go through here.

455
01:15:10,361 --> 01:15:12,158
Let's leave sleeping beauty there.

456
01:15:26,361 --> 01:15:27,919
I'll get the drink.

457
01:16:15,961 --> 01:16:17,440
That's my kid.

458
01:16:19,441 --> 01:16:20,430
Bronwyn.

459
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:23,760
She's 13 now.

460
01:16:27,121 --> 01:16:29,681
She doesn't look like you.

461
01:16:29,801 --> 01:16:34,158
Well, not the hair,
but the nose, don't you think?

462
01:16:34,281 --> 01:16:36,237
No, I don't see it.

463
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:38,114
I don't suppose she'll mind.

464
01:16:40,121 --> 01:16:41,031
Do you not get on?

465
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:42,150
No idea.

466
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:44,158
We don't know each other.

467
01:16:44,841 --> 01:16:46,752
Her mother told her I was dead.

468
01:16:47,361 --> 01:16:49,670
I went to her school last week.

469
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:52,157
She didn't know me.

470
01:16:52,761 --> 01:16:54,558
I'm working on it.

471
01:16:57,161 --> 01:16:58,992
It's fucking hard,
this going straight,

472
01:16:59,121 --> 01:17:00,793
in lots of ways.

473
01:17:14,001 --> 01:17:17,994
Is that what you're doing?
Going straight, whatever you call it.

474
01:17:19,041 --> 01:17:20,793
I'm trying.

475
01:17:26,081 --> 01:17:27,560
That feels good.

476
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:31,355
One of life's small pleasures,
taking your boots off.

477
01:17:35,961 --> 01:17:37,314
Come here.

478
01:17:38,041 --> 01:17:40,032
Give me your feet.

479
01:17:59,921 --> 01:18:01,639
That must feel nice.

480
01:18:03,561 --> 01:18:06,200
I don't know how you walk about
in those things.

481
01:18:18,121 --> 01:18:19,474
Sorry.

482
01:18:19,601 --> 01:18:21,034
My hands are rough from carving.

483
01:18:29,241 --> 01:18:30,435
What's it gonna be?

484
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:33,073
I don't know yet.

485
01:18:33,201 --> 01:18:34,714
We'll see.

486
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:38,237
Every piece of wood is different.

487
01:18:38,361 --> 01:18:39,760
You're supposed to...

488
01:18:41,721 --> 01:18:44,076
You're supposed to let it be
whatever it wants.

489
01:18:50,241 --> 01:18:51,310
Listen.

490
01:18:53,041 --> 01:18:54,076
Do you hear that?

491
01:18:57,361 --> 01:18:58,271
Foxes.

492
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:01,834
There's loads round here.

493
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:07,031
That noise is so weird.

494
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:20,595
What about this?

495
01:19:47,481 --> 01:19:49,437
You've got very nice breasts.

496
01:19:55,241 --> 01:19:56,799
You're a sexy fucking bitch.

497
01:22:44,361 --> 01:22:45,589
Do you want to fuck me?

498
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:46,915
From the moment I saw you.

499
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:48,030
Say it.

500
01:22:48,161 --> 01:22:49,833
- I want to fuck you.
- Say it again.

501
01:22:49,961 --> 01:22:51,110
I'm going to fuck you.

502
01:22:56,321 --> 01:22:57,515
What if I say no?

503
01:22:57,641 --> 01:23:00,109
I might have to force myself on you.

504
01:23:08,521 --> 01:23:10,034
So what are you waiting for?

505
01:24:24,161 --> 01:24:25,753
You all right?

506
01:24:29,041 --> 01:24:31,157
I was just joining in.

507
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:33,356
I didn't hurt you?

508
01:24:34,201 --> 01:24:35,634
Got to go home.

509
01:24:35,761 --> 01:24:37,638
You've got to go home?

510
01:24:37,761 --> 01:24:39,911
It's the middle of the night.

511
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:42,271
It's not nice round here.

512
01:24:42,401 --> 01:24:44,278
I can't let you go.

513
01:24:46,721 --> 01:24:48,791
Can't stop me either.

514
01:24:48,921 --> 01:24:50,673
I'm not sure I know
what's going on.

515
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:57,757
Are you married or something?

516
01:24:57,881 --> 01:24:59,280
I am.

517
01:24:59,401 --> 01:25:00,959
At least let me call you a cab.

518
01:25:01,081 --> 01:25:03,037
I've got a number, I'm fine.

519
01:25:04,201 --> 01:25:06,590
Was it just a shag you wanted, then?

520
01:25:09,161 --> 01:25:10,276
I guess so.

521
01:25:10,401 --> 01:25:11,595
Fuck off, then.

522
01:25:11,721 --> 01:25:13,439
See if I fucking care.

523
01:26:34,601 --> 01:26:35,431
Oh! Shit.

524
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:16,999
Hello?

525
01:27:17,121 --> 01:27:19,237
Yeah. Police, please.

526
01:27:40,201 --> 01:27:41,634
How you doing?

527
01:27:41,761 --> 01:27:43,319
OK.

528
01:27:45,201 --> 01:27:47,715
I brought some clothes -
just some comfy things.

529
01:27:47,841 --> 01:27:49,399
I hope they're OK.

530
01:27:50,401 --> 01:27:51,720
Thanks.

531
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:57,119
Would you like me to call anyone?

532
01:27:57,241 --> 01:27:59,630
No. It's fine.

533
01:28:00,641 --> 01:28:02,950
Well, when you're ready,

534
01:28:03,081 --> 01:28:05,117
I'll get a car
to take you to the clinic,

535
01:28:05,241 --> 01:28:08,677
and they'll take you home afterwards
as well, all right?

536
01:28:08,801 --> 01:28:12,396
I've left your clothes on the chair.
Your keys are there too.

537
01:29:16,521 --> 01:29:18,318
Don't fucking move. Listen.

538
01:29:18,441 --> 01:29:21,558
If you fucking struggle,
I'll batter the fuck out of you.

539
01:29:21,681 --> 01:29:24,275
Look at me. Listen.

540
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,278
All right?

541
01:29:28,081 --> 01:29:30,993
What the fuck
did you tell the police about Clyde?

542
01:29:32,081 --> 01:29:33,992
You know they've nicked him?

543
01:29:34,121 --> 01:29:35,918
He won't get bail,
not with his record.

544
01:29:36,041 --> 01:29:38,760
So what the fuck
are you playing at?

545
01:29:38,881 --> 01:29:40,758
Answer me!

546
01:29:43,041 --> 01:29:45,714
- He forced me to have sex with him.
- No, he didn't.

547
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:48,230
- He did.
- You're lying.

548
01:29:49,241 --> 01:29:51,709
You would have screamed.
I didn't hear anything.

549
01:29:51,841 --> 01:29:53,877
- You were drunk.
- April wasn't,

550
01:29:54,001 --> 01:29:56,037
and she didn't hear fuck all.

551
01:29:57,121 --> 01:30:00,158
I shared a cell with him
for a whole year,

552
01:30:00,281 --> 01:30:03,796
23 hours out
the fucking day, right?

553
01:30:03,921 --> 01:30:07,231
You have any idea
how desperate you get for sex?

554
01:30:09,761 --> 01:30:12,594
And if he was like that,
he would have tried it on me,

555
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:15,360
and he never did.

556
01:30:15,481 --> 01:30:16,914
So you're fucking lying.

557
01:30:17,041 --> 01:30:19,111
You don't know anything.

558
01:30:21,281 --> 01:30:24,353
The wee girl he killed
was my daughter.

559
01:30:24,481 --> 01:30:26,756
He killed my daughter.

560
01:30:26,881 --> 01:30:30,271
- He never killed anybody's daughter.
- Look in my fucking purse, then.

561
01:30:30,401 --> 01:30:33,950
You've got my fucking purse.
Look in it. Look in my purse.

562
01:30:34,081 --> 01:30:37,039
Look in my purse.
There's a photo.

563
01:30:37,161 --> 01:30:39,038
There's a photo.

564
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:19,558
He never talks about what he did.

565
01:31:28,841 --> 01:31:30,718
Sorry about the kid.

566
01:33:36,161 --> 01:33:38,436
Hey! You're late.

567
01:33:39,241 --> 01:33:41,357
What happened to your face?

568
01:33:42,921 --> 01:33:46,118
What's up with you?
Seen too much shit today?

569
01:33:46,241 --> 01:33:48,835
Fuck off, Avery.
Go and look after your family.

570
01:33:51,641 --> 01:33:53,279
Fuck you.

571
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:19,678
I'm sorry.

572
01:35:31,841 --> 01:35:35,117
Detective Tolland?
This is Jackie Morrison.

573
01:35:35,241 --> 01:35:38,756
<i>- Hi, Jackie.
- Yes, yes, I'm all right, thanks.</i>

574
01:35:38,881 --> 01:35:40,951
This is a bit difficult.

575
01:35:41,081 --> 01:35:45,154
I want to drop the charges
against Clyde Henderson.

576
01:35:47,241 --> 01:35:48,993
Yeah, I know.

577
01:35:49,121 --> 01:35:51,840
No. No, it's not that.

578
01:35:53,321 --> 01:35:56,199
Right. OK.

579
01:35:56,321 --> 01:35:58,198
Yeah, I'll be all right.

580
01:36:21,881 --> 01:36:23,553
Hey!

581
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:27,278
Don't you ignore me.

582
01:36:36,441 --> 01:36:37,920
Oi!

583
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:41,317
- I'm gonna fucking knock you out.
- You're gonna knock me out?

584
01:36:41,441 --> 01:36:44,114
- You killed my family. How dare you?
- It wasn't my fault.

585
01:36:44,241 --> 01:36:46,596
You were driving,
off your head on crack.

586
01:36:48,521 --> 01:36:53,072
- I want you to tell me about it.
- I can't believe I didn't know you.

587
01:36:53,201 --> 01:36:55,431
You didn't look at me in court,
not once.

588
01:36:57,041 --> 01:36:59,999
It was my fault they went out.
I needed a break.

589
01:37:00,121 --> 01:37:02,237
I shouted at her before she left.

590
01:37:09,841 --> 01:37:14,039
I told her to get out my sight.
It was the last thing I said.

591
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:16,038
Please.

592
01:37:17,121 --> 01:37:18,998
Please.

593
01:37:45,721 --> 01:37:47,632
I lost control on the corner.

594
01:37:51,361 --> 01:37:53,556
The car went into the bus stop.

595
01:37:59,361 --> 01:38:01,238
Did they know?

596
01:38:02,641 --> 01:38:05,201
The man saw me,
but not the kid.

597
01:38:05,321 --> 01:38:07,755
He tried to push the kid out the way,
but...

598
01:38:09,761 --> 01:38:11,592
I want them back.

599
01:38:15,601 --> 01:38:18,718
They died instantly.
They must have done.

600
01:38:24,881 --> 01:38:26,758
Fuck you.

601
01:38:33,761 --> 01:38:35,717
Look, what do you want?

602
01:38:35,841 --> 01:38:37,718
I'm sorry.

603
01:38:39,201 --> 01:38:41,271
What can I say?

604
01:38:42,401 --> 01:38:44,471
It's not all right.

605
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:50,280
This shit happens every day.
That's life.

606
01:38:53,561 --> 01:38:56,553
My husband's name was John.

607
01:38:56,681 --> 01:38:59,479
My little girl's name is Sorcha.

608
01:39:08,521 --> 01:39:11,399
You shouted at your little girl
the day she died.

609
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:14,711
But at least she was loved.

610
01:39:18,801 --> 01:39:21,361
Some people don't get that.

611
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:36,116
Fuck this.

612
01:39:42,601 --> 01:39:44,432
Clyde.

613
01:39:50,841 --> 01:39:52,672
Your daughter...

614
01:39:52,801 --> 01:39:54,871
Is it Bronwyn?

615
01:39:58,721 --> 01:40:00,200
Aye.

616
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:04,637
She called at your place.
She was looking for you at Red Road.

617
01:40:08,761 --> 01:40:11,321
How do you know
who my daughter is?

618
01:40:13,321 --> 01:40:15,676
You told me about her.

619
01:40:50,681 --> 01:40:51,750
Jackie.

620
01:40:51,881 --> 01:40:56,033
- Sorry, I should have rung.
- No. No, come in. It's all right.

621
01:40:56,161 --> 01:40:57,674
- I'll get the kettle on.
- Thanks.

622
01:40:58,361 --> 01:41:00,477
Alfred's by the telly, as usual.

623
01:41:00,601 --> 01:41:03,798
You might not get a nice welcome,
but just ignore him.

624
01:41:57,881 --> 01:42:01,157
- Jackie.
- Brenda's making the tea.

625
01:42:01,281 --> 01:42:05,320
You're lucky to find us in.
We're normally out on a Sunday.

626
01:42:05,441 --> 01:42:07,033
Och.

627
01:42:07,161 --> 01:42:08,674
Here.

628
01:42:08,801 --> 01:42:11,110
He can't stand strangers.

629
01:42:13,561 --> 01:42:15,153
Hates women.

630
01:42:15,281 --> 01:42:17,636
Nearly had Aunt Kath's finger off
last week.

631
01:42:20,921 --> 01:42:22,798
- Is he new?
- Oh, no.

632
01:42:22,921 --> 01:42:24,832
Had him a couple of years.

633
01:42:25,841 --> 01:42:27,718
He's a stubborn wee bugger.

634
01:42:54,961 --> 01:42:56,633
Thanks.

635
01:42:57,961 --> 01:42:59,633
Ta.

636
01:43:13,561 --> 01:43:17,031
Do you remember when John and I took
Sorcha camping up at Loch Lomond?

637
01:43:47,841 --> 01:43:50,514
Do you think that would be
a good place for him to be?

638
01:43:58,521 --> 01:44:01,160
John loved Loch Lomond.

639
01:44:01,681 --> 01:44:05,230
We took him camping there
every summer, as a boy.

640
01:44:09,761 --> 01:44:11,433
I'm sorry.

641
01:44:11,561 --> 01:44:13,711
There, love.

642
01:44:13,841 --> 01:44:16,036
Come on.

643
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:18,516
It was a terrible accident.

644
01:45:17,921 --> 01:45:19,559
Hello.

645
01:45:19,681 --> 01:45:21,672
- Is it a boy or a girl?
- It's a girl.

646
01:45:21,801 --> 01:45:24,031
- She's lovely.
- Thank you.

647
01:45:24,161 --> 01:45:26,038
Come on.
