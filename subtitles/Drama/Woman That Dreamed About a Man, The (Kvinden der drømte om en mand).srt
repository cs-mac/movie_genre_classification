1
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:11,962
<i>I am Ghost Agent K.</i>

2
00:00:12,542 --> 00:00:14,672
<i>A shadow without a name or reputation.</i>

3
00:00:16,002 --> 00:00:18,302
<i>Now, the wood carving mission is over.</i>

4
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:19,842
<i>Ghost.</i>

5
00:00:20,342 --> 00:00:21,342
<i>Disappear.</i>

6
00:00:21,972 --> 00:00:25,182
<i>Chairman Byung-do Mo's slush fund
is worth a trillion won.</i>

7
00:00:25,972 --> 00:00:27,102
<i>Let's finish this up.</i>

8
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:28,812
<i>The tapes were sent.</i>

9
00:00:29,272 --> 00:00:31,482
<i>The path is in the Word.</i>

10
00:00:33,192 --> 00:00:34,192
<i>Found it.</i>

11
00:00:46,122 --> 00:00:48,242
EPISODE 13

12
00:01:07,852 --> 00:01:09,102
Why have you come here?

13
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:26,702
Something this dangerous doesn't suit you.

14
00:02:01,192 --> 00:02:02,322
If I were going to kill you,

15
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,112
there are more silent ways than this.

16
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,462
If you aren't here for revenge,

17
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:20,542
then what do you want?

18
00:02:22,302 --> 00:02:23,302
A deal.

19
00:02:24,672 --> 00:02:26,472
I will be your black ops agent.

20
00:02:27,762 --> 00:02:29,762
A black ops agent?

21
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:34,602
I'm sorry, but I refuse any illegal deals.

22
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:38,692
Illegal and legal.

23
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,772
I'll decide on the method,

24
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,112
as long as the payment
for the result is guaranteed.

25
00:02:46,152 --> 00:02:48,468
You must have been misinformed,

26
00:02:48,492 --> 00:02:52,202
but I am cooperating with the NIS
to clean up our dark past

27
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:54,178
filled with slush funds and illegal deals.

28
00:02:54,202 --> 00:02:56,212
Mr. Jang could never become
one of your people.

29
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,812
The fact that I'm alive is proof of that.

30
00:03:03,382 --> 00:03:05,022
So, Congressman Baek's tapes were missing

31
00:03:06,092 --> 00:03:07,802
from Chairman Mo's secret storage room?

32
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:18,232
It looks like your war against
Congressman Baek has begun.

33
00:03:21,942 --> 00:03:25,692
Mr. Jang isn't an adequate weapon
in a dark fight where there are no rules.

34
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:29,492
Are you?

35
00:03:30,452 --> 00:03:32,122
I'm a little expensive,

36
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:34,122
but I earn every penny.

37
00:03:38,712 --> 00:03:40,212
Test Mr. Jang.

38
00:03:41,672 --> 00:03:43,752
I showed up alive instead of disappearing.

39
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:47,342
See what he does with me.

40
00:03:51,512 --> 00:03:53,102
Seung-jae Mo.

41
00:03:55,852 --> 00:03:58,613
He clenched his jaw when I mentioned
the war against Congressman Baek,

42
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:00,442
so Seung-jae Mo doesn't have

43
00:04:00,692 --> 00:04:02,328
the missing tapes
on Congressman Baek either.

44
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:06,652
According to the clue Agent Yoon left,
it's somewhere on the 58th floor

45
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:08,902
of the Songsan building.

46
00:04:09,702 --> 00:04:11,412
It wasn't in Seung-jae Mo's office.

47
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,752
So it isn't in his office.

48
00:04:24,502 --> 00:04:25,398
Where is it then?

49
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,962
There's one person who knows for sure.

50
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:33,682
If we profile him,
we'll find a clue as to where it's hidden.

51
00:04:34,392 --> 00:04:35,392
Who?

52
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,142
Who else?

53
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:40,002
It's naturally the person who hid them.
Chairman Byung-do Mo.

54
00:04:41,312 --> 00:04:42,352
He's dead.

55
00:04:43,982 --> 00:04:47,192
If we look carefully
at what he left behind and didn't,

56
00:04:48,572 --> 00:04:49,612
we can profile him.

57
00:04:51,192 --> 00:04:52,192
It won't be easy.

58
00:04:53,532 --> 00:04:54,612
There are perks.

59
00:04:55,532 --> 00:04:57,832
The dead don't lie.

60
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:02,712
You approached Seung-jae Mo
in order to profile Chairman Mo.

61
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:06,922
Because the most critical hint
that Chairman Mo left behind...

62
00:05:10,672 --> 00:05:11,672
is Seung-jae Mo.

63
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,512
<i>Un-gwang's bodyguard is still alive.</i>

64
00:05:15,892 --> 00:05:17,932
I liked how thorough you were.

65
00:05:18,722 --> 00:05:19,812
I'm disappointed.

66
00:05:20,392 --> 00:05:21,732
I'll take care of it.

67
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:25,078
What about the missing tapes
on Congressman Baek?

68
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:28,402
We haven't found any leads yet.

69
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:32,468
That's not what I wanted to hear either.

70
00:05:32,492 --> 00:05:37,678
The Prosecutor's Office and the NIS
are investigating the Baek Infantry.

71
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:40,768
If you want to wage a war
against Congressman Baek,

72
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:43,162
you should have conclusive evidence
to put an end to him!

73
00:05:44,962 --> 00:05:46,252
I swear to you.

74
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,632
I will take down Congressman Baek
and the Baek Infantry.

75
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,172
Trust me and wait.

76
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,602
<i>"Find the missing tapes
of Congressman Baek.</i>

77
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:03,522
The traitor knows your weakness. Agent Y."

78
00:06:04,142 --> 00:06:05,142
Agent Y?

79
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:06,562
But Robert Yoon is dead.

80
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:08,998
I think someone else sent it.

81
00:06:09,022 --> 00:06:10,208
Who?

82
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:14,048
A few people come to mind.
Dong-hyun is looking into it.

83
00:06:14,072 --> 00:06:16,552
What about the weakness
that was mentioned in the text message?

84
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:18,452
Is that your weakness?

85
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:20,242
Yes.

86
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:23,372
That's why if I stop here,

87
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,502
everyone will be in danger.

88
00:06:34,462 --> 00:06:38,182
With Mr. Jang's Plan B,
we can't finish off Congressman Baek

89
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:41,278
or Seung-jae Mo.

90
00:06:41,302 --> 00:06:42,302
So?

91
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:44,312
Will you continue with your mission?

92
00:06:44,852 --> 00:06:46,942
I will return to work tomorrow.

93
00:06:48,602 --> 00:06:51,082
I need to return to my cover
as your bodyguard for the mission.

94
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:53,782
You said the man who shot you
told you to disappear.

95
00:06:55,152 --> 00:06:56,672
Living as Seol-woo Kim, the bodyguard,

96
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:58,742
rather than an NIS agent

97
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:03,332
is the complete disappearance
that I chose.

98
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:09,332
This mission is a two-fold one.

99
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:13,172
The only people who know about it
are Dong-hyun

100
00:07:14,882 --> 00:07:15,882
and you.

101
00:07:16,342 --> 00:07:17,342
Only me?

102
00:07:17,882 --> 00:07:18,988
Doesn't Do-ha know?

103
00:07:19,012 --> 00:07:20,932
I don't want to worry her.

104
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:23,538
What about me?

105
00:07:23,562 --> 00:07:24,852
Is it okay for me to worry?

106
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:29,062
You and I promised
not to keep secrets from each other.

107
00:07:30,732 --> 00:07:31,732
That's true,

108
00:07:32,192 --> 00:07:33,192
since we are brothers.

109
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:39,202
What about the other promise?

110
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:41,702
Once the mission is complete,

111
00:07:42,282 --> 00:07:43,922
I will discuss my retirement from the NIS

112
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,638
with you.

113
00:07:46,662 --> 00:07:47,752
Good.

114
00:07:48,212 --> 00:07:49,212
Okay.

115
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:51,672
I will help with your two-fold mission.

116
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,422
Thank you.

117
00:07:53,922 --> 00:07:56,252
But you know, what about

118
00:07:56,882 --> 00:07:58,632
the $5,000,000...

119
00:08:00,432 --> 00:08:01,682
Do-ha.

120
00:08:02,302 --> 00:08:03,722
Un-gwang, I'm here.

121
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:06,102
Oh.

122
00:08:06,522 --> 00:08:08,562
Seol-woo, you're here.

123
00:08:09,602 --> 00:08:10,602
Yes.

124
00:08:11,522 --> 00:08:12,772
Here.

125
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,652
Hi.

126
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,848
Are you going back to work tomorrow?

127
00:08:27,872 --> 00:08:30,808
Are you feeling all better?
Don't you need to rest more?

128
00:08:30,832 --> 00:08:33,252
Are you on another mission?

129
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,712
Take a breath.

130
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:37,802
Ask one question at a time.

131
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:45,762
Is your wound fully healed?

132
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:50,602
Yes.

133
00:08:51,182 --> 00:08:52,368
I can move without any problem.

134
00:08:52,392 --> 00:08:54,442
You can rest a few more days.

135
00:08:55,312 --> 00:08:56,822
I still have duties to attend to.

136
00:08:58,112 --> 00:08:59,732
I was told to disappear,

137
00:09:00,112 --> 00:09:02,532
so I should live
as Un-gwang's bodyguard for a while.

138
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:08,372
I can't get involved myself,

139
00:09:08,952 --> 00:09:11,502
so Dong-hyun will do the hard stuff.

140
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:15,922
All I'll be doing until the $5,000,000
has been settled

141
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:17,922
is to keep doing
the lovers tactic with you.

142
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:20,172
That's all.

143
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:23,882
Is that really all?

144
00:09:25,302 --> 00:09:26,342
Rest assured.

145
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:31,062
This mission is like a vacation to me.

146
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:38,772
NOLBOO RESTAURANT

147
00:09:42,032 --> 00:09:45,388
I'm officially taking a day off today.

148
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:47,322
Okay. Sure. Go ahead.

149
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:50,388
But is there an international
soccer match or something?

150
00:09:50,412 --> 00:09:53,662
It's much more important
than the World Cup.

151
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,558
What is it?

152
00:09:55,582 --> 00:09:59,252
I need to make the right connections
before it's too late

153
00:10:00,252 --> 00:10:03,132
and make money for Do-ha's wedding.

154
00:10:03,512 --> 00:10:04,512
How?

155
00:10:05,762 --> 00:10:07,512
<i>Congressman Baek...</i>

156
00:10:08,092 --> 00:10:11,142
Save the country in times of chaos,

157
00:10:11,772 --> 00:10:13,352
and get myself a job.

158
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:15,192
Good day.

159
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:17,652
Sir...

160
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:21,418
<i>His ratings have gone up 5%</i>

161
00:10:21,442 --> 00:10:23,878
<i>and is currently at 26.7%.</i>

162
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:26,572
<i>He is now in third place.</i>

163
00:10:26,862 --> 00:10:30,008
<i>His ratings are low among
people in their 20s and 30s,</i>

164
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:32,992
<i>but he's leading among people
in their 50s and above.</i>

165
00:10:33,622 --> 00:10:38,608
<i>The survey was conducted among
the residents of Seoul aged 19 and above.</i>

166
00:10:38,632 --> 00:10:40,422
We should've ended him for good.

167
00:10:40,882 --> 00:10:42,882
If only the tapes on him
were in the storage room.

168
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:47,262
Aren't we at an advantage already
with the tapes on the Baek Infantry?

169
00:10:47,842 --> 00:10:48,842
I'm not sure.

170
00:10:49,092 --> 00:10:52,562
I wonder if I can fight
Congressman Baek with just Mr. Jang.

171
00:10:53,852 --> 00:10:55,522
Something just feels wrong.

172
00:10:56,102 --> 00:11:01,088
I feel like I was used in their reforming
of the NIS and purging of Baek Infantry.

173
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:03,362
You gave him a chance,
so trust him a little more.

174
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:05,572
I should, for now.

175
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:09,742
<i>Test Mr. Jang.</i>

176
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,992
I showed up alive instead of disappearing.

177
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:16,202
See what he does with me.

178
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:42,612
Guard Kim.

179
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,192
This coffee is...

180
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:47,402
made from the same beans
as Jongro Coffee from Jongro, and...

181
00:11:55,122 --> 00:11:58,542
I truly think Do-ha is lucky
to have met you.

182
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,752
That kind of luck will never
come to her again.

183
00:12:01,332 --> 00:12:03,212
Also, you're too good for...

184
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:17,762
As long as it isn't poisoned.

185
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:26,152
I respect you.

186
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,362
Weren't you on vacation?

187
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,152
I'm back as of today.

188
00:12:37,412 --> 00:12:38,518
Hey.

189
00:12:38,542 --> 00:12:40,228
I came to see Congressman Baek,

190
00:12:40,252 --> 00:12:42,122
the first suspect
for impersonating Agent Y.

191
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:44,422
He's putting on such a show.

192
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:48,712
I sincerely apologize
to everyone across the country

193
00:12:49,552 --> 00:12:53,842
for my people
being involved in the Songsan-gate.

194
00:12:54,342 --> 00:12:55,658
This is wrong!

195
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,472
No! This is wrong!

196
00:12:58,102 --> 00:13:02,328
This is unfair!
Congressman Baek is innocent!

197
00:13:02,352 --> 00:13:03,442
Okay.

198
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:06,522
Thank you, but I'm doing an interview.

199
00:13:06,862 --> 00:13:08,652
Congressman, be strong.

200
00:13:09,232 --> 00:13:10,418
I love you.

201
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:12,282
- I introduced myself before...
- Please leave.

202
00:13:12,782 --> 00:13:14,662
No! That's not it!

203
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:18,452
Congressman, I will join you

204
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:22,018
with vigor and the loudest voice!

205
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:24,832
Okay. Sign him up for my campaign.

206
00:13:25,962 --> 00:13:27,188
Double his pay.

207
00:13:27,212 --> 00:13:28,462
- Yes, sir.
- Wait...

208
00:13:28,672 --> 00:13:29,502
I love you.

209
00:13:29,632 --> 00:13:31,422
I love you, In-soo Baek!

210
00:13:32,012 --> 00:13:33,932
- Let's go register.
- Okay.

211
00:13:34,762 --> 00:13:37,802
I apologize for that. Let's start over.

212
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:43,288
I apologize to our great citizens
from the bottom of my heart.

213
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:46,352
Then, lift your pants.
I will whip you for you.

214
00:13:50,482 --> 00:13:51,482
What are you doing here?

215
00:13:51,942 --> 00:13:55,412
I sent you a summons so that we can
talk in the warm Prosecutor's Office.

216
00:13:55,612 --> 00:13:58,638
What are you doing on the cold street?

217
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:01,178
If you're upset, just give your statement
at the Prosecutor's Office.

218
00:14:01,202 --> 00:14:03,082
I'm the one who is upset.

219
00:14:03,292 --> 00:14:06,292
Everyone, why must I go
to the Prosecutor's Office?

220
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:09,922
The people close to you said otherwise.

221
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:14,672
The Baek Infantry fellows
have zero loyalty, you know.

222
00:14:15,342 --> 00:14:18,488
Don't give me false testimonies like that.

223
00:14:18,512 --> 00:14:21,392
Bring me the solid evidence.
I need solid evidence!

224
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,788
I heard you didn't even find tapes on me
in Chairman Mo's storage room.

225
00:14:25,812 --> 00:14:28,562
Didn't you think
that I would find it soon,

226
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:30,192
Agent Y?

227
00:14:31,692 --> 00:14:32,692
Agent Y?

228
00:14:38,162 --> 00:14:42,332
Look, I don't know what you're up to,

229
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:47,212
but if you found them,
you would've brought an arrest warrant.

230
00:14:48,752 --> 00:14:51,398
You're so quick.

231
00:14:51,422 --> 00:14:53,802
Stop being crafty, and leave.

232
00:14:54,212 --> 00:14:58,222
He's interfering with my campaign.
Can a prosecutor do this?

233
00:14:58,722 --> 00:15:01,602
Okay. I'll see you again.

234
00:15:02,262 --> 00:15:03,262
Good luck.

235
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,972
Take care.

236
00:15:06,682 --> 00:15:09,442
Okay. Let's do it again.

237
00:15:11,232 --> 00:15:15,402
<i>There are several clues in this message
that help us identify the sender.</i>

238
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:17,032
What clues?

239
00:15:17,612 --> 00:15:18,612
The first sentence.

240
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:21,872
"Find the missing tapes
of Congressman Baek."

241
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:25,232
It must be someone who wants
the tapes of Congressman Baek.

242
00:15:25,582 --> 00:15:27,808
Also, someone who knows
that they are missing.

243
00:15:27,832 --> 00:15:28,922
Yes.

244
00:15:30,712 --> 00:15:31,712
The second sentence.

245
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,802
"The traitor knows your weakness."

246
00:15:36,382 --> 00:15:37,988
It's someone who knows you.

247
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:40,182
Also, the person knows who the traitor is.

248
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:46,142
But why did this person
impersonate Agent Y, who is already dead?

249
00:15:46,932 --> 00:15:48,942
"If you're curious, come to me."

250
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:51,562
That's what it must mean.

251
00:15:58,112 --> 00:16:00,072
My phone number.

252
00:16:00,572 --> 00:16:03,282
Here. I'll enter the number.

253
00:16:03,782 --> 00:16:07,598
Myung-suk Cha. Thank you.

254
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:08,622
It's me.

255
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:12,082
There's another person who meets
the criteria of that fake Agent Y.

256
00:16:16,212 --> 00:16:17,332
UN-GWANG'S FAN SIGNING EVENT

257
00:16:17,712 --> 00:16:19,608
- I love you.
- Un-gwang!

258
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:21,342
I love you.

259
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:22,722
Here.

260
00:16:24,012 --> 00:16:26,198
Un-gwang!

261
00:16:26,222 --> 00:16:28,222
- May I get a picture?
- Sure.

262
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,248
The worst there is.

263
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:32,312
- Thank you.
- I love you!

264
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:34,958
UN-GWANG'S FAN SIGNING EVENT

265
00:16:34,982 --> 00:16:36,402
Un-gwang!

266
00:16:38,992 --> 00:16:40,782
I need to go somewhere tonight.

267
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:44,702
Is it dangerous? Should I go with you?

268
00:16:45,412 --> 00:16:46,308
It's okay.

269
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,412
Okay.

270
00:16:47,742 --> 00:16:51,082
I have nothing special tonight,
so you may go after this is over.

271
00:16:51,662 --> 00:16:52,672
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

272
00:16:53,832 --> 00:16:55,212
Look here!

273
00:16:55,462 --> 00:16:57,092
- Un-gwang!
- Here!

274
00:16:57,882 --> 00:16:58,922
Un-gwang!

275
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:00,922
Un-gwang!

276
00:17:03,512 --> 00:17:04,932
I need to step away for a moment.

277
00:17:05,932 --> 00:17:06,932
Who is that?

278
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,012
It's him.

279
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,852
Our side's traitor. The jerk who shot you?

280
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:13,788
Yes.

281
00:17:13,812 --> 00:17:16,402
That jerk. How dare he come here?

282
00:17:16,772 --> 00:17:18,918
Should I teach him a lesson?

283
00:17:18,942 --> 00:17:19,942
I'll be back.

284
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:37,882
What are you trying to pull?

285
00:17:40,462 --> 00:17:41,462
Who are you?

286
00:17:42,722 --> 00:17:45,432
I'm Un-gwang Yeo's bodyguard,
Seol-woo Kim.

287
00:17:46,222 --> 00:17:47,682
Don't you understand

288
00:17:48,852 --> 00:17:50,078
what the missed gunshot means?

289
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:52,248
Ghost Agent K is dead.

290
00:17:52,272 --> 00:17:53,788
Then, why are you back?

291
00:17:53,812 --> 00:17:55,982
If you were going to throw me away,

292
00:17:56,522 --> 00:17:58,122
you should've gotten rid of me for good.

293
00:18:01,862 --> 00:18:05,452
I gave you a chance to live quietly.

294
00:18:06,162 --> 00:18:07,162
So?

295
00:18:08,782 --> 00:18:11,098
Should I thank you?

296
00:18:11,122 --> 00:18:13,522
Are you going to let
your personal feelings ruin the mission?

297
00:18:13,962 --> 00:18:15,042
What mission?

298
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,632
Let me make this clear.

299
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:20,592
Ghost Agent K is dead and gone.

300
00:18:21,752 --> 00:18:24,632
You won't regret that decision, right?

301
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:26,802
Regret is what I see on your face.

302
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:29,052
If you stand in my way,

303
00:18:30,352 --> 00:18:31,952
I'll have to change my decision as well.

304
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:34,982
I won't take it twice.

305
00:18:36,692 --> 00:18:37,692
Okay, then.

306
00:18:38,102 --> 00:18:39,232
I'm on duty, so...

307
00:18:56,252 --> 00:18:57,252
Mr. Jang?

308
00:19:02,712 --> 00:19:04,302
You must be Mr. Jang.

309
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:06,592
What are you doing?

310
00:19:07,052 --> 00:19:11,052
What are you doing, Mr. Jang,
senior manager of NIS?

311
00:19:11,182 --> 00:19:13,722
Are you illegally surveilling
our bodyguard?

312
00:19:15,812 --> 00:19:18,902
Where are you going? I want to talk.

313
00:19:19,522 --> 00:19:22,798
What's your problem?
Goodness, he isn't listening.

314
00:19:22,822 --> 00:19:24,822
Goodness. Hey!

315
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,032
I got your license plate number too.

316
00:19:33,702 --> 00:19:35,622
Don't you dare show up again.

317
00:19:35,832 --> 00:19:37,162
I'll just...

318
00:19:39,122 --> 00:19:40,372
What are you doing?

319
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:42,922
That's Mr. Jang, right?

320
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:44,728
I said, "Mr. Jang!"

321
00:19:44,752 --> 00:19:46,712
Then he turned around,
so I totally got him.

322
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:49,882
But why did he show up?

323
00:19:50,592 --> 00:19:55,368
He wouldn't make you do a mission
after what he did to you, would he?

324
00:19:55,392 --> 00:19:58,328
- I ended it for good.
- That's good.

325
00:19:58,352 --> 00:19:59,352
DELETE

326
00:19:59,942 --> 00:20:03,748
Why are you deleting them?
We need evidence in case...

327
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:04,982
If you really care for me,

328
00:20:05,862 --> 00:20:07,582
don't do something reckless
like this again.

329
00:20:09,742 --> 00:20:11,162
It's none of your business.

330
00:20:28,842 --> 00:20:30,302
Unbelievable.

331
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,262
They are so pathetic.

332
00:20:34,722 --> 00:20:35,722
So?

333
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:37,782
Have you been avoiding getting arrested?

334
00:20:41,272 --> 00:20:42,418
Yes, sir.

335
00:20:42,442 --> 00:20:43,442
No one followed me.

336
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:48,862
Here's some spending money.

337
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:50,942
Thank you.

338
00:20:51,492 --> 00:20:53,162
We'll have to move quietly.

339
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:56,622
I need to start the war against Songsan.

340
00:20:57,832 --> 00:20:59,002
Bring someone for me.

341
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:10,762
We named the foundation for your son
as Future Songsan Scholarship Foundation.

342
00:21:13,052 --> 00:21:14,618
For Jae-young?

343
00:21:14,642 --> 00:21:16,002
We have to prepare for his future.

344
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:18,722
Songsan's future is Jae-young's future.

345
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:22,062
You have to prepare his inheritance now.

346
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:27,692
We will also donate 20% of Songsan
Holdings' stock to the foundation.

347
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:31,322
The experts took care
of the complicated stuff.

348
00:21:31,902 --> 00:21:34,282
I would like you to be
the foundation's chairperson.

349
00:21:36,282 --> 00:21:38,098
I've never done things like that before.

350
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:39,952
Whom else could I trust

351
00:21:40,492 --> 00:21:42,082
to handle Jae-young's matter?

352
00:21:48,592 --> 00:21:51,212
So, tomorrow's campaign event
is at 7 a.m.?

353
00:21:51,592 --> 00:21:53,312
At the subway station,
during the rush hour?

354
00:21:53,672 --> 00:21:55,842
Okay.

355
00:21:57,262 --> 00:21:58,852
Sure. I won't be late.

356
00:21:58,972 --> 00:21:59,972
See you in the morning.

357
00:22:00,892 --> 00:22:01,892
For the nation!

358
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:07,838
Freeze!

359
00:22:07,862 --> 00:22:09,982
Who are you and why are you following me?

360
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:21,392
I'm Dong-hyun Lee, the prosecutor.

361
00:22:21,912 --> 00:22:22,912
Hello, Mr. Myung-suk Cha.

362
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:25,912
Mr. Lee?

363
00:22:27,832 --> 00:22:28,832
Have you eaten?

364
00:22:32,512 --> 00:22:37,488
Are you saying the one
framing me for Robert Yoon's murder

365
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:39,328
is Congressman Baek? Are you sure?

366
00:22:39,352 --> 00:22:40,972
Keep it down.

367
00:22:41,812 --> 00:22:46,538
Congressman Baek is the one
who hired the hitman to kill Robert Yoon.

368
00:22:46,562 --> 00:22:48,918
Then arrest him and lock him up!

369
00:22:48,942 --> 00:22:52,232
So don't go around
wearing things like that.

370
00:22:53,732 --> 00:22:55,862
- What?
- Are you a janitor or something?

371
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:02,452
I'm so pissed off! That asshole!

372
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:04,952
That rat!

373
00:23:06,162 --> 00:23:07,752
You scum!

374
00:23:09,382 --> 00:23:10,382
Keep a distance from him.

375
00:23:11,092 --> 00:23:13,712
Don't go anywhere near him.

376
00:23:14,132 --> 00:23:15,398
One bad move,

377
00:23:15,422 --> 00:23:17,722
and your innocent daughter
will suffer again.

378
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:20,052
My daughter?

379
00:23:21,222 --> 00:23:24,118
Did that jerk do something to my daughter?

380
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:25,142
No.

381
00:23:25,722 --> 00:23:27,182
I mean...

382
00:23:28,482 --> 00:23:31,588
If the dad keeps going to jail,

383
00:23:31,612 --> 00:23:33,272
the family will definitely suffer.

384
00:23:33,942 --> 00:23:35,192
Think about it.

385
00:23:39,162 --> 00:23:42,662
- That's right.
- That's right, so...

386
00:23:43,032 --> 00:23:46,582
How shall I help you?

387
00:23:55,842 --> 00:23:56,842
What is this?

388
00:23:57,632 --> 00:23:58,632
A bag.

389
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:01,182
I know it's a bag.

390
00:24:04,052 --> 00:24:06,312
Is this part of the lovers tactic?

391
00:24:08,732 --> 00:24:11,402
Is there a special mechanism in here?

392
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:14,652
I already have a GPS tracker.

393
00:24:15,232 --> 00:24:17,112
So is it a hidden camera? Or a microphone?

394
00:24:19,242 --> 00:24:23,032
If I press this, will a video
be transmitted somewhere?

395
00:24:23,702 --> 00:24:24,742
A spy bag?

396
00:24:26,872 --> 00:24:27,872
It's just...

397
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,832
a pretty, ordinary bag.

398
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:35,212
It's a gift.

399
00:24:38,422 --> 00:24:39,512
A gift?

400
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:42,512
I'm sorry for getting angry.

401
00:24:46,472 --> 00:24:48,722
For what happened earlier?

402
00:24:54,482 --> 00:24:55,482
I understand.

403
00:24:56,272 --> 00:24:58,072
You can be sensitive during a mission.

404
00:24:59,402 --> 00:25:01,072
What happened earlier was nothing,

405
00:25:02,492 --> 00:25:05,912
so you just continue performing your duty.

406
00:25:07,702 --> 00:25:08,702
My duty?

407
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,872
Carry the bag
and keep being the pretty you.

408
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:17,962
Do it as my girlfriend.

409
00:25:28,472 --> 00:25:32,392
Hey. I met with Congressman Baek, and...

410
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:38,862
- Guard Kim isn't back yet?
- No.

411
00:25:39,942 --> 00:25:43,242
But how did you know about this place?

412
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:48,872
This is our hideout. But why are you...

413
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:53,662
You're here for the mission.
The two-fold mission.

414
00:25:54,752 --> 00:25:56,632
How did you know...

415
00:25:57,212 --> 00:26:00,212
Brother and I have no secrets.

416
00:26:01,632 --> 00:26:04,858
I wanted to have chicken
and beer with him.

417
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:06,528
I guess he'll be back late.

418
00:26:06,552 --> 00:26:09,472
Yes, I guess so.

419
00:26:11,852 --> 00:26:15,392
Chicken should be eaten
before it gets cold.

420
00:26:16,152 --> 00:26:17,312
What do you say?

421
00:26:17,862 --> 00:26:18,982
How about a drumstick and...

422
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:21,732
- Okay?
- Well,

423
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,192
I am always in.

424
00:26:25,702 --> 00:26:26,742
Okay.

425
00:26:28,032 --> 00:26:29,332
- Okay.
- Come this way.

426
00:26:34,372 --> 00:26:36,212
Mr. Jang went to see you?

427
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,092
However, I'm still alive.

428
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:46,302
Mr. Jang has no intention of killing me.

429
00:26:47,682 --> 00:26:51,932
So he wasn't on my side after all,
but with the NIS.

430
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:55,982
A person's nature doesn't change.

431
00:26:57,312 --> 00:27:01,022
Even with menacing antlers,
a deer is still a deer,

432
00:27:01,982 --> 00:27:04,032
and a hunter is a hunter.

433
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,322
Also, are you a hunter?

434
00:27:07,952 --> 00:27:08,952
Whatever.

435
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:12,058
More like the side that eats,
not get eaten.

436
00:27:12,082 --> 00:27:14,372
How can I know you won't betray me then?

437
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:16,462
How can I trust you?

438
00:27:17,922 --> 00:27:19,042
You should not.

439
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:20,962
Since when do you need trust in a deal?

440
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:23,302
What will you offer me?

441
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:30,472
Yesterday's ally has become
today's most threatening enemy.

442
00:27:32,762 --> 00:27:34,442
I'll get rid of Congressman Baek for good.

443
00:27:35,602 --> 00:27:38,538
Why would a toothless fox be threatening?

444
00:27:38,562 --> 00:27:41,362
If you want to make a deal,
call me before it's too late.

445
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:46,692
I can become anyone's shadow,
not just yours.

446
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:11,892
<i>You drink so well, Mr. Lee.</i>

447
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:13,182
- Have some.
- Okay.

448
00:28:13,512 --> 00:28:16,538
So that's what happened
during the Black Auction mission.

449
00:28:16,562 --> 00:28:17,562
It's $5,000,000.

450
00:28:17,772 --> 00:28:20,272
That was amazing. You made
an incredible bet of $5,000,000.

451
00:28:20,852 --> 00:28:24,128
That goes without saying. It was awesome.

452
00:28:24,152 --> 00:28:26,482
You're extraordinary. That was great.

453
00:28:27,322 --> 00:28:29,822
You're a real man.

454
00:28:30,152 --> 00:28:35,058
While performing the mission,
I realized that I was born to be a spy.

455
00:28:35,082 --> 00:28:38,478
I can fight. My acting skills
make me a top Hollywood star.

456
00:28:38,502 --> 00:28:40,438
I have fast reflexes
and can make quick judgments.

457
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:41,582
Also, above all else,

458
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:43,502
I have the key criterion of a spy.

459
00:28:44,382 --> 00:28:45,568
Good looks.

460
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:46,478
Pardon?

461
00:28:46,502 --> 00:28:50,132
Maybe I should retire from acting
and give my remaining days to the country.

462
00:28:51,092 --> 00:28:52,972
- No.
- Why not? You said I'm extraordinary.

463
00:28:53,972 --> 00:28:57,868
Secret agents working in the shadows
get called a lot of names.

464
00:28:57,892 --> 00:29:00,682
Come on. You must not know me.

465
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,612
I've heard people call me
an evil jerk all my life.

466
00:29:05,192 --> 00:29:07,572
That doesn't even compare.

467
00:29:08,482 --> 00:29:12,452
We have to even shoot a colleague
if that's part of a mission.

468
00:29:13,862 --> 00:29:17,452
Is my brother like that too?

469
00:29:18,042 --> 00:29:19,042
He's outstanding.

470
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:23,042
He's someone
you must not meet as an enemy.

471
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:26,712
His eyes usually look emotionless
unless he's on a mission

472
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:29,382
or playing video games.

473
00:29:29,672 --> 00:29:33,512
But something seemed different
during this mission.

474
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:37,868
The kid that I knew
would've gotten payback

475
00:29:37,892 --> 00:29:41,352
for being shot and disappeared
without a trace.

476
00:29:42,312 --> 00:29:46,482
But rather than revenge,
he's saying he will fulfill his duty.

477
00:29:46,862 --> 00:29:48,362
How odd.

478
00:29:49,782 --> 00:29:51,822
Is it because of his weakness?

479
00:29:52,572 --> 00:29:53,572
It could be.

480
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:55,152
I think so.

481
00:30:01,702 --> 00:30:05,622
To a secret agent, the people he is
surrounded by could serve as a weakness.

482
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:10,552
Don't worry about it.
He always takes care of it.

483
00:30:35,612 --> 00:30:38,742
Father Michael asked me
to give this to you when he left.

484
00:30:39,202 --> 00:30:41,452
He asked me to do so if you return.

485
00:31:05,232 --> 00:31:09,862
<i>You probably came looking for me
because you wanted to ask something,</i>

486
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:15,612
<i>but I have no more wisdom
to share with you.</i>

487
00:31:18,112 --> 00:31:20,162
<i>But I must warn you.</i>

488
00:31:21,742 --> 00:31:23,872
<i>You shouldn't touch the item</i>

489
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:27,502
<i>that led Agent Y to his death.</i>

490
00:31:29,212 --> 00:31:33,552
<i>It is far beyond what you imagine.</i>

491
00:31:36,092 --> 00:31:39,722
<i>The darkest shadow's abyss.</i>

492
00:31:45,142 --> 00:31:47,392
<i>Disappear while you can.</i>

493
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:51,902
<i>Don't trust anyone.</i>

494
00:32:04,492 --> 00:32:05,492
Cheers.

495
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,882
He has good taste in bags.

496
00:32:16,592 --> 00:32:17,648
You're right.

497
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:21,158
You were half dead when you broke up.
Are you happy you're back together?

498
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:23,262
Yes, I am.

499
00:32:25,262 --> 00:32:26,392
I'm so happy.

500
00:32:28,642 --> 00:32:29,882
Then why do you look like that?

501
00:32:34,402 --> 00:32:35,902
When I do think about it,

502
00:32:36,732 --> 00:32:38,822
it's so good and I'm happy,

503
00:32:40,362 --> 00:32:41,862
but when we're together,

504
00:32:43,372 --> 00:32:44,832
he sometimes seems estranged

505
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:46,808
and scary.

506
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,938
He changes when you're alone with him?
Is he mean to you?

507
00:32:49,962 --> 00:32:51,082
No.

508
00:32:51,962 --> 00:32:54,132
I know it's because
he cares so much for me, but...

509
00:32:57,552 --> 00:33:00,922
at times, he seems cold.

510
00:33:01,432 --> 00:33:04,092
That's how real-life relationships are.

511
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:06,932
You don't understand everything
just because you love the person.

512
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,998
Is this how all love is?

513
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:13,998
After some time,
you'll wonder why you ever felt that way.

514
00:33:14,022 --> 00:33:15,272
That's love.

515
00:33:17,652 --> 00:33:18,942
When time passes,

516
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:24,888
would I wonder why I ever felt this way?

517
00:33:24,912 --> 00:33:27,008
So enjoy it while you can.

518
00:33:27,032 --> 00:33:29,162
Why is your mind so complicated
all of a sudden?

519
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:34,212
Okay. What's the point in worrying?

520
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:37,462
I should be as happy as I can be
while he's with me.

521
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:40,488
Because love is a happy thing.

522
00:33:40,512 --> 00:33:42,512
Yes. But don't do anything stupid.

523
00:33:43,182 --> 00:33:44,722
He's pretty affectionate.

524
00:33:46,092 --> 00:33:47,432
I'm so jealous.

525
00:33:48,352 --> 00:33:49,352
He's a good fighter.

526
00:33:49,932 --> 00:33:52,522
That's not something to brag about.

527
00:33:52,682 --> 00:33:53,682
No.

528
00:33:55,402 --> 00:33:56,402
He has to be.

529
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:58,902
He does.

530
00:34:09,702 --> 00:34:11,558
So, Father Michael disappeared.

531
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:13,542
Based on his letter,

532
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:16,212
I don't think he was the one
impersonating Agent Y.

533
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:19,132
I mentioned Agent Y
and tested Congressman Baek,

534
00:34:19,842 --> 00:34:20,842
and it wasn't him either.

535
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:22,212
Agent Y?

536
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:23,762
Agent Y?

537
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:31,432
I don't think Congressman Baek
would do something this complicated.

538
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:33,142
Who was the other suspect?

539
00:34:33,732 --> 00:34:34,732
Myung-suk Cha.

540
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:38,312
- Do-ha's dad?
- Yes.

541
00:34:39,982 --> 00:34:41,862
Since he worked with Robert Yoon,

542
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:44,032
I thought he could be, and I followed him.

543
00:34:45,152 --> 00:34:46,152
Then?

544
00:34:47,572 --> 00:34:48,782
It wasn't him.

545
00:34:49,282 --> 00:34:50,702
Freeze.

546
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:53,202
I'm so pissed off. That rat.

547
00:34:53,372 --> 00:34:55,542
He didn't even know
Congressman Baek framed him.

548
00:34:59,582 --> 00:35:01,712
So it's none of the suspects
that we thought of.

549
00:35:03,052 --> 00:35:04,302
What about Seung-jae Mo?

550
00:35:04,882 --> 00:35:07,092
I threw him another bait,
so he'll nibble on it soon.

551
00:35:09,222 --> 00:35:10,392
Go home for today.

552
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:15,642
What will you do about him?

553
00:35:18,852 --> 00:35:20,692
Seriously.

554
00:35:23,822 --> 00:35:25,992
Let him be. I'll wake him in the morning.

555
00:35:27,572 --> 00:35:28,888
Will you let him sleep here?

556
00:35:28,912 --> 00:35:31,202
Then what? Should I carry that big mass?

557
00:35:33,452 --> 00:35:34,662
You go home.

558
00:35:39,292 --> 00:35:41,332
He's such a nuisance.

559
00:35:52,052 --> 00:35:55,472
Goodness. Sorry, I'm late.

560
00:35:55,682 --> 00:35:58,442
Director Park of Songsan Group.

561
00:36:01,902 --> 00:36:04,192
You know who I am, don't you?

562
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:06,918
Candidate number one, In-soo Baek.

563
00:36:06,942 --> 00:36:07,942
I do.

564
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:11,072
But why am I...

565
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:14,782
I looked into your past activities,

566
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,728
and all the money you took under the table

567
00:36:17,752 --> 00:36:20,228
while working
as Songsan's Director of Finance

568
00:36:20,252 --> 00:36:22,518
was enough to buy a skyscraper.

569
00:36:22,542 --> 00:36:25,962
Are you threatening me?

570
00:36:26,922 --> 00:36:29,422
Exactly. You're smart.

571
00:36:34,142 --> 00:36:37,142
Speak humbly and lower your eyes, asshole.

572
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:44,112
Did the late Chairman Mo keep
his video tapes anywhere else?

573
00:36:44,942 --> 00:36:45,942
I...

574
00:36:46,692 --> 00:36:48,628
I don't know.

575
00:36:48,652 --> 00:36:52,362
You had been maintaining
his slush fund the entire time.

576
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:55,242
I handled the accounting,

577
00:36:55,912 --> 00:37:00,752
but I really don't know anything else.

578
00:37:01,162 --> 00:37:05,092
Also, did you continue to maintain
the slush fund after Seung-jae took over?

579
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:08,052
Yes.

580
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:12,632
Good. In that case, let's do this.

581
00:37:13,052 --> 00:37:16,262
As a way of repenting
for your past wrongs,

582
00:37:17,142 --> 00:37:19,932
why don't you make a public confession?

583
00:37:27,322 --> 00:37:28,402
<i>We'll make sure</i>

584
00:37:28,982 --> 00:37:30,968
that the scholarship foundation
provides opportunities

585
00:37:30,992 --> 00:37:32,928
for underprivileged youths.

586
00:37:32,952 --> 00:37:38,518
I'm here to tell the truth
about the recent Songsan-gate.

587
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:40,808
She'll run this foundation
with a motherly approach.

588
00:37:40,832 --> 00:37:43,912
I'm Mi-eun Song and I'll be running the
Future Songsan Scholarship Foundation.

589
00:37:44,172 --> 00:37:47,542
The slush fund was continued to be funded

590
00:37:47,672 --> 00:37:52,422
through accounting fraud
even under the control of its CEO,

591
00:37:52,552 --> 00:37:53,858
Seung-jae Mo.

592
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:57,222
Mr. Joon-won Park,
our Good Samaritan informant,

593
00:37:57,352 --> 00:37:59,408
will submit himself
to the prosecutor tomorrow

594
00:37:59,432 --> 00:38:02,538
and submit all the documentation.

595
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:06,652
I request that Seung-jae Mo,
the core of the slush fund,

596
00:38:07,062 --> 00:38:08,772
be thoroughly investigated.

597
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:13,532
FUTURE SONGSAN SCHOLARSHIP FOUNDATION

598
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:23,518
What were you doing?

599
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:26,002
- How did you let this happen?
- I'm sorry, sir.

600
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:28,688
Bribe, threaten,
do whatever it takes to stop it!

601
00:38:28,712 --> 00:38:30,052
I'll take care of it.

602
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,632
What happened?

603
00:38:36,222 --> 00:38:38,222
Congressman Baek stabbed me in the back.

604
00:38:39,602 --> 00:38:41,602
You should calm yourself.

605
00:38:42,182 --> 00:38:43,772
Call the NIS,

606
00:38:44,602 --> 00:38:46,312
and bring me that rat, Joon-won Park.

607
00:38:51,272 --> 00:38:55,112
Do anything and everything necessary
to resolve this quickly.

608
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:06,662
Let's make a deal.

609
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:09,172
I'm sure you know what I need.
What do you want?

610
00:39:10,462 --> 00:39:11,462
I need $5,000,000.

611
00:39:12,132 --> 00:39:13,132
Okay.

612
00:39:13,252 --> 00:39:14,512
Make sure you have results.

613
00:39:25,022 --> 00:39:26,482
Who was that?

614
00:39:29,522 --> 00:39:30,692
Dong-hyun wants to meet.

615
00:39:31,692 --> 00:39:34,152
There's nothing left to do today,
so I'm going to leave early.

616
00:39:35,152 --> 00:39:36,992
- Sure.
- Call me later.

617
00:39:51,712 --> 00:39:52,712
It's been a while.

618
00:39:54,212 --> 00:39:56,722
Are we on the same team again?

619
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,512
No?

620
00:40:02,392 --> 00:40:04,512
Are you still working on a mission?

621
00:40:05,972 --> 00:40:08,998
If you have nothing to say, I'll go now.

622
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,522
Here's a piece of advice.

623
00:40:15,782 --> 00:40:18,702
If you've decided to join our side,
get your head on straight.

624
00:40:19,112 --> 00:40:23,242
Now, it's live or die,
protect or lose, that is all.

625
00:40:23,912 --> 00:40:27,832
Don't rule out any method and fix
the Congressman Baek problem.

626
00:40:44,892 --> 00:40:46,908
Is everything okay
with the filming venues?

627
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:48,432
Everything is fine.

628
00:40:49,062 --> 00:40:53,272
But then, I can't forget that cathedral
we went to the other day.

629
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:58,088
It isn't fit for the ending scene,
but it may fit the wedding scene.

630
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,758
A wedding at a cathedral?

631
00:40:59,782 --> 00:41:02,162
Why? It sounds good to me.

632
00:41:03,742 --> 00:41:05,202
I love it.

633
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:08,242
I should pick out a new wedding dress.

634
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:11,228
Something elegant and refined.

635
00:41:11,252 --> 00:41:14,108
- Make your acting like that too.
- Why you...

636
00:41:14,132 --> 00:41:17,052
Annam Cathedral is nice.

637
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:18,188
You know it too?

638
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:21,528
- Is that the cathedral you mentioned?
- Yes.

639
00:41:21,552 --> 00:41:25,972
I know it very well. I went every week
when I was Mi-eun's manager.

640
00:41:28,142 --> 00:41:29,682
Mi-eun went to that cathedral?

641
00:41:30,272 --> 00:41:31,272
Yes.

642
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,602
But she never went there on Sundays,

643
00:41:34,062 --> 00:41:35,458
but only on Mondays.

644
00:41:35,482 --> 00:41:37,322
She said it was nice to pray
when it was empty.

645
00:41:39,902 --> 00:41:41,692
It has a nice feel to it.

646
00:41:42,532 --> 00:41:44,242
Seung-jae Mo

647
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:48,098
Seung-jae Mo called.

648
00:41:48,122 --> 00:41:51,752
He must be pissed off
about what happened today.

649
00:41:52,792 --> 00:41:56,648
He took the bait, so it's time to move.

650
00:41:56,672 --> 00:41:58,018
What will you do?

651
00:41:58,042 --> 00:41:59,682
<i>Congressman Baek is the target right now.</i>

652
00:42:01,302 --> 00:42:03,382
He started the fight
using conspiracies and sabotage.

653
00:42:04,382 --> 00:42:06,092
We can't be too gentle on them, can we?

654
00:42:24,532 --> 00:42:25,532
Director Park.

655
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:27,468
We're with NIS.

656
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:28,758
Stop them.

657
00:42:28,782 --> 00:42:30,718
This is official business. Step aside.

658
00:42:30,742 --> 00:42:33,002
- You can't go.
- We'll arrest you for obstruction. Move!

659
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:35,582
Move.

660
00:42:44,132 --> 00:42:45,222
Arrest them all!

661
00:43:00,112 --> 00:43:01,232
It's Park.

662
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,968
The NIS agents showed up,
as you said they would,

663
00:43:03,992 --> 00:43:05,628
<i>but I got away.</i>

664
00:43:05,652 --> 00:43:07,282
Okay, good.

665
00:43:07,862 --> 00:43:10,428
I should be there on time by 10 a.m.

666
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:14,888
Good. When you get to the Prosecutor's
Office, Prosecutor Park is one of ours.

667
00:43:14,912 --> 00:43:17,422
Just answer his questions honestly.

668
00:43:18,002 --> 00:43:19,462
I will.

669
00:43:30,352 --> 00:43:32,182
The Prosecutor's Office is the other way.

670
00:43:35,982 --> 00:43:37,142
Stay quiet.

671
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:41,272
If you do anything stupid,
the car will depreciate.

672
00:43:57,252 --> 00:43:58,812
<i>If you're with neither Congressman Baek</i>

673
00:43:59,752 --> 00:44:00,922
nor the NIS,

674
00:44:02,712 --> 00:44:04,552
whom are you with and who are you?

675
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,592
Relax.

676
00:44:08,342 --> 00:44:09,278
PROSECUTOR DONG-HYUN LEE

677
00:44:09,302 --> 00:44:10,552
I'm a prosecutor.

678
00:44:13,392 --> 00:44:15,198
I see. The prosecutor.

679
00:44:15,222 --> 00:44:19,982
- But I was on my way to see you...
- Yes.

680
00:44:20,732 --> 00:44:24,442
Park is Congressman Baek's dog
dressed as a prosecutor.

681
00:44:25,732 --> 00:44:30,492
Are those the documents on Seung-jae Mo's
involvement with the slush fund?

682
00:44:32,162 --> 00:44:33,242
Yes.

683
00:44:34,832 --> 00:44:37,332
- Here.
- Let's see.

684
00:44:38,582 --> 00:44:40,872
Let me ask you a few questions.

685
00:44:41,542 --> 00:44:44,422
During Chairman Mo's era,

686
00:44:44,922 --> 00:44:47,422
you managed the slush fund
and were close to him, correct?

687
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:49,922
Yes.

688
00:44:51,012 --> 00:44:52,512
The details on the slush fund

689
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:54,142
are in those documents...

690
00:44:54,722 --> 00:44:55,932
By chance...

691
00:44:57,272 --> 00:44:59,392
Have you ever seen
something like a secret safe

692
00:45:00,352 --> 00:45:03,232
on the 58th floor of the Songsan building?

693
00:45:04,152 --> 00:45:05,152
Pardon?

694
00:45:05,982 --> 00:45:07,232
I heard

695
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:11,242
there's a secret room on the 58th floor
where bribes are exchanged.

696
00:45:32,342 --> 00:45:34,238
We don't have to meet like this anymore.

697
00:45:34,262 --> 00:45:36,552
What have you been up to?

698
00:45:38,062 --> 00:45:40,982
Did you kidnap Songsan's finance director?

699
00:45:42,602 --> 00:45:43,732
I don't know.

700
00:45:45,152 --> 00:45:48,942
A skilled Ghost agent doesn't leave
a trail like somebody.

701
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:52,882
Did you make a deal with Seung-jae Mo?

702
00:45:55,072 --> 00:45:58,452
You weren't going to hand over
the director, were you?

703
00:46:02,662 --> 00:46:05,542
You were going to protect him
before Seung-jae Mo could get to him,

704
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:10,302
- right?
- The NIS doesn't abduct civilians.

705
00:46:12,722 --> 00:46:15,892
It's as predicted. How boring.

706
00:46:18,222 --> 00:46:20,772
You really aren't cut out for this.

707
00:46:21,352 --> 00:46:22,352
So?

708
00:46:22,852 --> 00:46:24,482
What have you been doing?

709
00:46:25,142 --> 00:46:26,142
Revenge?

710
00:46:28,312 --> 00:46:32,152
You know how I work and complete missions.

711
00:46:41,582 --> 00:46:42,872
Are you working on a mission?

712
00:46:52,922 --> 00:46:54,422
- In-soo Baek.
- In-soo Baek.

713
00:46:54,672 --> 00:46:58,552
Clean politics, transparent society.
Candidate number one. Please remember.

714
00:47:00,432 --> 00:47:02,038
Candidate number one...

715
00:47:02,062 --> 00:47:04,458
- In-soo Baek.
- In-soo Baek.

716
00:47:04,482 --> 00:47:06,788
- Vote for In-soo Baek.
- In-soo Baek.

717
00:47:06,812 --> 00:47:09,838
- In-soo Baek.
- Vote for In-soo Baek.

718
00:47:09,862 --> 00:47:10,902
You...

719
00:47:13,902 --> 00:47:16,952
It's been a while.
I'm not happy to see you though.

720
00:47:17,992 --> 00:47:19,992
You were alive. You're like a cockroach.

721
00:47:20,832 --> 00:47:23,912
I have too many grudges to die so soon.

722
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:25,912
Are you threatening me?

723
00:47:27,002 --> 00:47:28,422
Take a look at your gift...

724
00:47:32,672 --> 00:47:33,922
and withdraw quietly.

725
00:47:37,012 --> 00:47:38,198
NUMBER ONE CANDIDATE
IN-SOO BAEK

726
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:39,618
Please vote for In-soo Baek.

727
00:47:39,642 --> 00:47:42,538
- In-soo Baek.
- In-soo Baek.

728
00:47:42,562 --> 00:47:43,722
I gave it to him.

729
00:47:44,852 --> 00:47:48,272
Seung-jae Mo never ordered me
to maintain the slush fund.

730
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:50,312
You confessed to the public.

731
00:47:50,692 --> 00:47:52,732
Now, you're denying it?

732
00:47:53,652 --> 00:47:54,652
That's correct.

733
00:48:00,112 --> 00:48:03,742
<i>Robert Yoon is the NIS' mole.</i>

734
00:48:04,242 --> 00:48:05,452
<i>Get rid of him tonight.</i>

735
00:48:06,622 --> 00:48:07,872
<i>Should I kill him?</i>

736
00:48:08,082 --> 00:48:09,922
<i>Also, make sure he can't be found.</i>

737
00:48:18,222 --> 00:48:19,592
Shit!

738
00:48:26,432 --> 00:48:27,602
Shit.

739
00:48:50,292 --> 00:48:51,372
<i>I have decided</i>

740
00:48:52,422 --> 00:48:55,252
to take responsibility
for the recent corruption scandal

741
00:48:56,132 --> 00:48:59,092
and withdraw from the mayoral election,

742
00:49:00,052 --> 00:49:03,222
as well as retire
from politics completely.

743
00:49:17,942 --> 00:49:19,612
You took care of things with spirit.

744
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:20,862
Good job.

745
00:49:24,662 --> 00:49:26,282
Here are the ledgers.

746
00:49:31,752 --> 00:49:34,188
You didn't make copies, did you?

747
00:49:34,212 --> 00:49:35,842
Will you believe me if I say I didn't?

748
00:49:38,922 --> 00:49:41,012
SONGSAN BORROWED ACCOUNTS LIST

749
00:49:44,552 --> 00:49:47,762
You said deals are made on money,
not trust, correct?

750
00:49:52,942 --> 00:49:54,272
Here's the $5,000,000.

751
00:49:57,522 --> 00:50:00,572
Are you going to take that and disappear?

752
00:50:02,112 --> 00:50:05,202
As long as the payment is right,
you can call me whenever you need me.

753
00:50:06,622 --> 00:50:07,622
Okay, then.

754
00:50:21,922 --> 00:50:25,342
The three of them were originally a team.

755
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:28,302
The other one must be lonely.

756
00:50:29,262 --> 00:50:31,812
By the way, Un-gwang...

757
00:50:33,392 --> 00:50:36,312
Seol-woo is working
on a mission, isn't he?

758
00:50:38,192 --> 00:50:39,192
What?

759
00:50:39,692 --> 00:50:42,798
No. I haven't heard anything.

760
00:50:42,822 --> 00:50:44,492
I'm not stupid.

761
00:50:44,952 --> 00:50:46,532
I have my hunch.

762
00:50:51,992 --> 00:50:54,032
He's hiding it from me
in case I would worry, right?

763
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:58,712
That idiot. Like I wouldn't figure it out.

764
00:51:01,752 --> 00:51:02,752
Weakness.

765
00:51:07,892 --> 00:51:10,892
To a secret agent, the people he is
surrounded by could serve as a weakness.

766
00:51:14,142 --> 00:51:16,232
Pretend not to know,
so that he doesn't worry.

767
00:51:16,852 --> 00:51:19,772
He's a skilled secret agent,
so he'll take care of it.

768
00:51:32,452 --> 00:51:35,292
<i>Will you leave or stay
once the mission is complete?</i>

769
00:51:35,872 --> 00:51:39,632
<i>Once the mission is complete,
I will discuss my retirement from the NIS</i>

770
00:51:40,132 --> 00:51:41,792
<i>with you.</i>

771
00:51:43,172 --> 00:51:44,592
Stay with me

772
00:51:45,052 --> 00:51:46,052
as my family,

773
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:49,052
and as my brother.

774
00:51:49,182 --> 00:51:53,182
Are we continuing the lovers tactic?

775
00:51:53,722 --> 00:51:57,482
<i>Should I disappear as Mr. Jang said?</i>

776
00:51:58,852 --> 00:51:59,942
Where to?

777
00:52:00,982 --> 00:52:01,982
Just...

778
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:04,442
to an average life.

779
00:52:06,742 --> 00:52:07,742
<i>Now,</i>

780
00:52:09,662 --> 00:52:10,662
you must choose too.

781
00:52:16,622 --> 00:52:17,792
Seol-woo.

782
00:52:26,922 --> 00:52:31,552
We decided to shoot the wedding scene
at Annam Cathedral.

783
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:33,028
I see.

784
00:52:33,052 --> 00:52:34,102
Okay.

785
00:52:34,432 --> 00:52:36,472
But you know,

786
00:52:36,682 --> 00:52:39,692
Mi-eun went to Annam Cathedral
every Monday as well.

787
00:52:40,062 --> 00:52:41,812
Isn't that kind of suspicious?

788
00:52:43,112 --> 00:52:44,362
It is.

789
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:54,832
Yes! I win again!

790
00:53:00,162 --> 00:53:02,882
Sorry, but I won again.

791
00:53:04,672 --> 00:53:05,712
One more game.

792
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:08,302
Again? Do you want to lose again?

793
00:53:09,012 --> 00:53:11,488
You've lost plenty already.
Enough to stop losing.

794
00:53:11,512 --> 00:53:13,618
I went easy on you.

795
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:15,852
I'm too much of a gentleman
to hit a woman.

796
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:17,432
Such a gentleman, I am.

797
00:53:19,892 --> 00:53:21,062
Really?

798
00:53:25,232 --> 00:53:26,522
I believe you.

799
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:41,042
It's awkward if you believe
that a joke is the truth.

800
00:53:42,212 --> 00:53:43,922
I'll believe your lies too.

801
00:53:45,132 --> 00:53:49,922
When I'm with you, I want to be happy
regardless of anything.

802
00:53:51,012 --> 00:53:54,512
Because we're doing the lovers tactic.

803
00:54:00,062 --> 00:54:01,182
One more game?

804
00:54:03,192 --> 00:54:04,482
One more.

805
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,072
I'll use him.

806
00:54:17,282 --> 00:54:20,952
I don't hear from you for days,
then suddenly, it's "I miss you. Hurry."

807
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:22,862
What do you think you're doing?

808
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:25,172
I'm sorry I couldn't contact you.

809
00:54:27,712 --> 00:54:28,922
It concerns national security,

810
00:54:29,422 --> 00:54:30,728
so I can't say why.

811
00:54:30,752 --> 00:54:32,972
Things must not have gone well.

812
00:54:34,222 --> 00:54:35,972
Do you always drink to get over it?

813
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:40,602
- Will you...
- I can't drink soju.

814
00:54:44,892 --> 00:54:46,292
Is it like this after marriage too?

815
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:49,088
Pardon?

816
00:54:49,112 --> 00:54:52,482
I heard some women never find out
that their husbands are NIS agents.

817
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:56,782
I guess I should get used to this.

818
00:54:58,492 --> 00:55:00,242
I can't drink soju.

819
00:55:01,242 --> 00:55:04,332
But I'll stay with you.

820
00:55:21,222 --> 00:55:24,102
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

821
00:55:25,682 --> 00:55:27,982
I resign as of today.

822
00:55:30,192 --> 00:55:31,192
What do you mean?

823
00:55:31,612 --> 00:55:35,152
I am not qualified to be a civil servant,
let alone an NIS agent.

824
00:55:36,152 --> 00:55:38,242
What nonsense is that?

825
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:43,412
Are you someone so irresponsible
that you would quit during a mission?

826
00:55:44,662 --> 00:55:46,662
The mission will be completed
perfectly without me.

827
00:55:47,622 --> 00:55:49,292
Ghost Agent K is on it.

828
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:54,092
Thank you for everything.

829
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:09,232
About that secret room on the 58th floor
where you made a deal with Seung-jae Mo,

830
00:56:09,652 --> 00:56:12,022
I think there is definitely
something there.

831
00:56:12,482 --> 00:56:17,612
The late Chairman Mo designed
the 58th floor himself,

832
00:56:18,452 --> 00:56:20,742
so no one knows the exact layout.

833
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:25,968
He may have designed it,

834
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:27,712
but someone else
had to have constructed it.

835
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:30,872
I had the same thought,
so I looked into it.

836
00:56:31,002 --> 00:56:34,382
But he died in a car accident.

837
00:56:35,212 --> 00:56:36,592
It is extremely suspicious.

838
00:56:48,812 --> 00:56:51,168
<i>If it is the Lord's will,
He will lead you to the right path.</i>

839
00:56:51,192 --> 00:56:53,482
<i>The path is in the Word.</i>

840
00:56:54,112 --> 00:56:55,902
<i>"Then war broke out in heaven.</i>

841
00:56:56,482 --> 00:56:59,428
<i>Michael and his angels
fought against the dragon."</i>

842
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,298
<i>Did you see Agent Y again, Father?</i>

843
00:57:01,322 --> 00:57:03,798
<i>He said what was found was not everything.</i>

844
00:57:03,822 --> 00:57:05,638
<i>"For God does speak - now one way,"</i>

845
00:57:05,662 --> 00:57:06,992
<i>now another,</i>

846
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:10,212
<i>"though no one perceives it."</i>

847
00:57:12,502 --> 00:57:14,132
So, the answer is in the 58th floor.

848
00:57:15,172 --> 00:57:16,382
VIP LOUNGE

849
00:57:17,382 --> 00:57:18,552
It must be somewhere there.

850
00:57:57,922 --> 00:57:59,462
I stopped by the office.

851
00:58:00,462 --> 00:58:01,462
Jae-young...

852
00:58:10,062 --> 00:58:11,742
I'll be home before Jae-young goes to bed.

853
00:58:12,272 --> 00:58:13,392
Okay.

854
00:58:17,312 --> 00:58:18,312
You.

855
00:58:20,282 --> 00:58:21,418
I'm Un-gwang Yeo's bodyguard,

856
00:58:21,442 --> 00:58:22,442
Seol-woo Kim.

857
00:58:23,612 --> 00:58:25,282
Mr. Jang planted me there through you,

858
00:58:25,862 --> 00:58:27,322
so you know I'm an NIS agent.

859
00:58:28,992 --> 00:58:30,792
What are you doing here?

860
00:58:31,662 --> 00:58:35,462
I'm searching for the missing tapes
of Chairman Baek as Agent Y instructed.

861
00:58:36,832 --> 00:58:37,832
Pardon?

862
00:58:39,552 --> 00:58:41,002
Wasn't it your orders,

863
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:42,882
Ms. Mi-eun Song?

864
00:58:46,842 --> 00:58:47,842
No.

865
00:58:50,512 --> 00:58:51,642
Fellow Ghost agent.

866
00:59:38,852 --> 00:59:40,338
<i>Why did you call me out?</i>

867
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:42,272
<i>We must find the missing tapes.</i>

868
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:45,298
<i>Whose side are you on?</i>

869
00:59:45,322 --> 00:59:49,362
<i>Something the late Chairman Mo left
only to Seung-jae Mo.</i>

870
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:50,952
<i>Found it.</i>

871
00:59:51,782 --> 00:59:53,412
<i>A little mouse sneaked in.</i>

872
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:57,292
<i>We will terminate the lovers tactic.</i>

873
00:59:57,922 --> 00:59:59,122
<i>Tonight,</i>

874
00:59:59,882 --> 01:00:01,842
<i>every mission will be terminated.</i>

875
01:00:02,462 --> 01:00:04,302
<i>Just kill him on sight!</i>
