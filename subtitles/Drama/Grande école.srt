1
00:00:07,247 --> 00:00:08,726
So your son made it.

2
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:10,878
Getting into
such a top school!

3
00:00:11,247 --> 00:00:12,726
You must be relieved.

4
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:14,525
Your firm
has a future now.

5
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:16,006
My son's
aiming higher.

6
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,642
Contracting is fine for my husband.

7
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:19,922
Some Bastille Day!

8
00:00:20,127 --> 00:00:21,879
The fireworks will be great!

9
00:00:22,047 --> 00:00:24,003
- Same school?
- l'm doing Lit.

10
00:00:24,207 --> 00:00:25,640
Agnes is at Normale Sup.

11
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:28,002
You're a human rights activist?

12
00:00:28,167 --> 00:00:29,236
Excuse us.

13
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:32,285
Why not? l work
for animal rights, myself.

14
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:35,405
- Know when the fireworks start?
- No idea.

15
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:38,001
- Would you know?
- Yes, right now.

16
00:00:41,807 --> 00:00:45,595
That how you passed the entrance
exams? Congratulations!

17
00:00:45,767 --> 00:00:47,280
You studied with him?

18
00:00:47,807 --> 00:00:50,002
You're not rooming with him!

19
00:00:50,167 --> 00:00:51,725
Him or another. We have to.

20
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:54,321
lt's regulations.
We're three to a flat.

21
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:55,966
Who's forcing you to?

22
00:00:56,127 --> 00:00:58,880
You can share
my Paris studio with me.

23
00:00:59,047 --> 00:01:00,719
And spend two hours commuting?

24
00:01:01,807 --> 00:01:04,321
Relax.
We'll see a lot of each other.

25
00:01:04,887 --> 00:01:06,206
l live on campus.

26
00:01:06,407 --> 00:01:09,285
lt promotes competitive spirit.

27
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,798
Mine wasn't bad either.

28
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:37,723
Have you seen Paul?

29
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:47,365
You can't live here, baby.
lt's gloomy.

30
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:54,565
When did they
last redecorate... 1950?

31
00:02:55,807 --> 00:02:59,402
Relax, Mom.
They want to keep us on campus.

32
00:03:00,087 --> 00:03:02,203
But that's no reason, baby.

33
00:03:02,487 --> 00:03:04,205
Don't call me that.

34
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:14,757
- Louis-Arnault Réal.
- Paul Thabor.

35
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:17,680
Bernard Chouquet.

36
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,724
l took the big bedroom.
First come, first served.

37
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:26,879
Excuse me,
but did your parents see

38
00:03:27,047 --> 00:03:30,357
how noisy the big bedroom is?

39
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:32,645
lt's none of their concern.

40
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:37,085
lt should be. You won't get any rest
with all that noise.

41
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:40,121
But as for my Bernard,

42
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:44,439
the noise of traffic and drills
lull him to sleep.

43
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:47,724
The other room is fine.
l'm not taking his.

44
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:52,318
- We have no choice.
- Trust me.

45
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,842
All the campus apartments
are the same.

46
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:57,077
- Think it over.
- Please, Mom!

47
00:04:01,327 --> 00:04:02,237
What's going on?

48
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,797
She thinks the flat's
not good enough for him.

49
00:04:05,967 --> 00:04:08,322
- Oh, no? Where's he from?
- L'lsle en Dodon.

50
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,480
ln the southwest.

51
00:04:10,727 --> 00:04:13,878
l see. The roommate situation
looks promising.

52
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,719
l don't mean you.

53
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:17,635
Then again...

54
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,045
Just kidding.

55
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,680
Here they are.

56
00:04:29,807 --> 00:04:31,957
Paul Thabor. Bernard Chouquet.

57
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,118
Emeline Dejour, my girlfriend.

58
00:04:35,207 --> 00:04:39,325
How convenient to have your
girlfriend in the same school!

59
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:41,121
Let's go.

60
00:04:44,287 --> 00:04:45,402
My dear friends,

61
00:04:45,607 --> 00:04:49,680
don't be surprised to hear
that word in my mouth.

62
00:04:49,887 --> 00:04:53,436
l'm more than your academic dean.

63
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:56,565
l want to be the go-between
who helps you

64
00:04:56,727 --> 00:05:01,118
gain admittance to the exclusive
club of captains of industry.

65
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:04,076
You may not always be liked.

66
00:05:04,247 --> 00:05:06,920
You may sometimes be feared.

67
00:05:08,087 --> 00:05:10,885
But you will always be respected.

68
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,159
Today, when the pressures
of globalization

69
00:05:15,367 --> 00:05:18,200
maintain suspicions of easy money

70
00:05:18,407 --> 00:05:21,797
l hope you always keep in mind
our school motto...

71
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:24,716
''No gain without pain.''

72
00:05:24,887 --> 00:05:29,085
So when you are forced to wield
the axe, to call for layoffs,

73
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:32,165
remember that the good
of your company

74
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:36,436
is the result of your labors,
your self-denial,

75
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,005
your self-sacrifice.

76
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:44,679
So welcome to this house
which is now your home.

77
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,799
May it be the temple
of your achievements,

78
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:53,317
the crucible of your future.

79
00:06:16,087 --> 00:06:17,156
What?

80
00:06:18,447 --> 00:06:20,278
You hit 'Alt'' and ''F4''.

81
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:22,764
lt makes it automatic.

82
00:06:22,927 --> 00:06:24,565
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

83
00:06:27,527 --> 00:06:30,325
- Did you pick your courses?
- Not yet.

84
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,484
We have to double up.

85
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:35,919
- Have to what?
- Work in pairs on certain subjects.

86
00:06:36,087 --> 00:06:37,406
Certain subjects?

87
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,639
Macro-economics.
Management. Marketing.

88
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,081
l see.

89
00:06:47,887 --> 00:06:49,798
This school has lots to offer.

90
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,486
Take advantage of it.

91
00:06:53,367 --> 00:06:55,039
Here comes Emeline.

92
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:57,323
- Where?
- Just kidding.

93
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:04,642
That why
you won't take class with her?

94
00:07:04,807 --> 00:07:05,842
Don't be silly.

95
00:07:06,167 --> 00:07:07,919
This is my son.

96
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:11,081
He has the skills?
Painting? Masonry?

97
00:07:11,247 --> 00:07:14,444
- He's a hard worker.
- We'll see about that.

98
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:19,923
Thierry, come here.

99
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,038
Put him on the paint job.

100
00:07:23,287 --> 00:07:25,118
Go change over there.

101
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,442
Welcome to <i>Normale Supérieure</i> .

102
00:07:55,247 --> 00:07:56,726
lsn't this beautiful?

103
00:07:57,407 --> 00:07:59,762
Nothing like your business school.

104
00:08:00,967 --> 00:08:03,003
Obviously. l'm normal,

105
00:08:03,247 --> 00:08:04,885
you're superior.

106
00:08:08,287 --> 00:08:10,437
When do l meet your friends,

107
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,962
the future masters of the world?

108
00:08:13,847 --> 00:08:15,041
Soon enough.

109
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,562
Louis-Arnault's dying to meet you.

110
00:08:17,927 --> 00:08:20,077
Seems l talk about you all the time.

111
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:28,478
Faster, guys!

112
00:08:56,087 --> 00:08:59,124
You were terrific!
You're dripping wet!

113
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:10,118
No women in the locker room.

114
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:11,766
- Too bad.
- Sorry.

115
00:09:22,407 --> 00:09:25,444
- ls it always like this?
- Especially when we win.

116
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,756
We're still dry. We'd better leave.

117
00:09:31,927 --> 00:09:34,487
- l think so, too. Coming?
- Be right out.

118
00:09:35,527 --> 00:09:38,883
l really like the flat
l found near campus.

119
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:41,318
The layout is stunning.

120
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,126
Will you come see it?

121
00:09:43,687 --> 00:09:45,518
- l mean, with Paul.
- Sure.

122
00:09:46,207 --> 00:09:48,767
Why didn't Louis-Arnault
move in with you?

123
00:09:48,927 --> 00:09:51,805
Not so fast.
l value my independence.

124
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,162
But the four of us could do dinner.

125
00:09:54,407 --> 00:09:56,967
l sure couldn't do one in my studio.

126
00:09:57,127 --> 00:09:58,958
Are you cramped for space?

127
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:02,039
lt's OK,
but not as good as yours.

128
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:04,486
Not bad.

129
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:06,120
Sexy, aren't they?

130
00:10:06,727 --> 00:10:08,797
l see we have similar tastes.

131
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:12,404
Your guy's not bad, either.

132
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,515
- Here come our athletes.
- How's it going?

133
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,876
- Need a lift?
- And our Business Club?

134
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:25,119
- We can take the metro.
- As you like.

135
00:10:25,287 --> 00:10:27,437
- Later.
- Tomorrow.

136
00:10:28,167 --> 00:10:29,361
Shall we?

137
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,880
Alone, at last!

138
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:35,806
Five minutes without Louis-Arnault?

139
00:10:35,967 --> 00:10:37,719
What's that supposed to mean?

140
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,037
This sports craze is new for you.

141
00:10:40,447 --> 00:10:42,642
Like your fits of jealousy?

142
00:10:44,327 --> 00:10:45,555
Let's go.

143
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:56,123
You almost finished?

144
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:01,439
l think l told you...
thicker lettering.

145
00:11:01,607 --> 00:11:04,326
- lt won't look nice.
- Beauty doesn't matter...

146
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,205
Make the D thicker.

147
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:09,995
Like that... You see?

148
00:11:10,527 --> 00:11:12,245
The bigger the better.

149
00:11:12,407 --> 00:11:15,319
''God is Great''...
''Deus Magnus est.''

150
00:11:16,287 --> 00:11:18,755
Sure, l got it. 'Allahu Akbar.''

151
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:35,878
His dad was a diplomat in Asia.

152
00:11:36,087 --> 00:11:37,202
You look surprised,

153
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:39,602
but you learn fast as a kid.

154
00:11:40,127 --> 00:11:43,244
Since you speak Chinese,
ask him for silverware.

155
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:46,120
Be right back.

156
00:11:48,927 --> 00:11:54,206
l could've applied for <i>Normale Sup</i> ,
too. For the beauty of it.

157
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:56,921
Meaning he thinks
he would have got in.

158
00:11:57,087 --> 00:11:59,920
Say what you mean.
Math gets you anywhere,

159
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,004
Lit gets you nowhere.

160
00:12:02,207 --> 00:12:04,038
The credo of bourgeois France!

161
00:12:07,207 --> 00:12:08,435
Who was that?

162
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:11,640
A journalist who did two years
in a labor camp.

163
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:14,116
lt didn't put him off Chinese food?

164
00:12:15,207 --> 00:12:16,606
lt wasn't in China.

165
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:21,765
- He's here for our conference.
- She's a human rights activist.

166
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:29,359
You asleep or daydreaming?

167
00:12:31,287 --> 00:12:33,676
'Even sleepers are workers

168
00:12:34,047 --> 00:12:37,517
and collaborators
in what goes on in the universe.''

169
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:41,917
A quote from Heraclitus.
A 5th century B.C. Greek poet.

170
00:12:42,447 --> 00:12:45,086
Greek? ls that for Mass?

171
00:12:45,247 --> 00:12:46,760
lt stimulates the senses.

172
00:12:47,007 --> 00:12:48,076
You studied Philo?

173
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,118
Socrates, Plato... ring a bell?

174
00:12:50,327 --> 00:12:51,760
That was ages ago.

175
00:12:51,927 --> 00:12:52,916
What did they say?

176
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:56,324
That we each search
for our missing better half.

177
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:59,083
Without finding it, l suppose.

178
00:12:59,847 --> 00:13:00,996
Not so sure.

179
00:13:07,807 --> 00:13:11,686
'As they are already friends
without contact of the senses,

180
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:15,966
it is unlikely that the pleasures
tasted weaken their friendship

181
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:19,642
but rather serve as a pledge
of pleasures to come.''

182
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:26,438
There's a meeting on start-ups.
lnterested?

183
00:13:26,607 --> 00:13:28,438
Not at all?

184
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,437
Coming to the start-up meeting?

185
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:42,835
l don't know.

186
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:45,760
We're having an informal
meeting on...

187
00:13:48,567 --> 00:13:50,637
Hold on... Let me start over.

188
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:54,766
A meeting on the plight
of start-ups in our school.

189
00:13:54,927 --> 00:13:56,599
- lnterested?
- When is it?

190
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:58,325
ln 10 minutes in Hall B.

191
00:13:58,487 --> 00:14:01,206
- l'm waiting for someone.
- Bring him along.

192
00:14:01,367 --> 00:14:04,723
- We'll see.
- Great. See you there.

193
00:14:20,047 --> 00:14:21,162
Yes, buy!

194
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,397
Buy, l tell you. Buy right away.

195
00:14:26,887 --> 00:14:29,640
Know how much
you made me lose last time?

196
00:14:29,807 --> 00:14:33,720
l didn't say, ''Take out...
an option,'' l said, ''Buy.''

197
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:37,404
So do it.
You work for me, right?

198
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,723
You didn't want a croissant?

199
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:52,720
What are you doing?

200
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:56,120
l'm trying to de-bourgeoise myself.

201
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:58,755
The word is ''disembourgeoise,''
l think.

202
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:01,686
lt took coming here to realize it.

203
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:04,122
They see me as provincial,
hard-working.

204
00:15:04,327 --> 00:15:08,115
l think l'm well-dressed, but to
them l look like a shop mannequin.

205
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,006
Next to me,
they're from another world.

206
00:15:11,167 --> 00:15:12,361
l can't see that.

207
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:16,276
They invent these elite schools
to reproduce a notch higher,

208
00:15:16,447 --> 00:15:18,756
to raise us above small trade.

209
00:15:18,927 --> 00:15:21,361
Doctors, they see us
heading German labs.

210
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,157
Engineers, they see us
running Silicon Valley.

211
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,120
As if it weren't any less empty.

212
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,006
But they can still be CEOs.

213
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:33,482
But almost without wanting to be.

214
00:15:33,647 --> 00:15:36,320
lt's a habit they acquire young.

215
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,637
We had to run to get this far.

216
00:15:39,367 --> 00:15:40,925
We start out breathless.

217
00:15:41,127 --> 00:15:44,437
We're privileged. Others would
settle for what we have.

218
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,446
Most even envy us.

219
00:15:46,607 --> 00:15:48,996
There's an exam
that stands between us.

220
00:15:50,287 --> 00:15:52,437
That exam is the key.

221
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:56,798
We're getting
the best education available.

222
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:00,158
The thing is to believe it.

223
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:02,921
You're one of the elite.
You're satisfied.

224
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,396
So for you, everything's fine.

225
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,686
l'm looking for my brother,
the new painter.

226
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,678
- The young guy?
- Yeah.

227
00:16:12,847 --> 00:16:14,803
He must be back there.

228
00:16:15,327 --> 00:16:17,477
Thanks, guys. Enjoy!

229
00:16:18,407 --> 00:16:20,967
lt's the refrain. l just wrote it.

230
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:22,316
So?

231
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:26,316
Not quite.

232
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,519
- You mean it?
- Only Mouss could write lyrics.

233
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:31,279
Not that traitor!

234
00:16:31,687 --> 00:16:34,326
Not: 'I walk head high
to hide my tears.''

235
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:38,002
No, it's:
'I walk with my head in the stars

236
00:16:38,167 --> 00:16:40,317
to keep my tears from falling.''

237
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:43,035
- You can't write that.
- Why not?

238
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:45,038
- lt's too much.
- Too much what?

239
00:16:45,207 --> 00:16:46,845
Too much self-pity.

240
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,640
So what?

241
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,157
- You asked, l'm telling you.
- Just wait.

242
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,040
Feelings are cruel,
but never excessive.

243
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:56,641
Look, l gotta get back to work.

244
00:16:57,287 --> 00:17:00,085
- See you tonight.
- Right.

245
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,205
What is this mess?

246
00:17:08,007 --> 00:17:09,645
Not you again!

247
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:13,635
- Sorry, chief, it was an accident.
- Glad to hear it!

248
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:17,476
- Look!
- What is it?

249
00:17:17,647 --> 00:17:19,319
l'll re-paint everything.

250
00:17:19,487 --> 00:17:22,399
Oh, yeah? Look at this cob job!

251
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:24,484
Did you learn in the Casbah?

252
00:17:24,647 --> 00:17:25,841
Do something.

253
00:17:27,407 --> 00:17:28,760
lt's not our business.

254
00:17:28,927 --> 00:17:33,079
You should've used a drop cloth.
You call this a good job?

255
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,283
He reads too much Foucault!

256
00:17:36,127 --> 00:17:39,244
You can't talk like that here.

257
00:17:39,407 --> 00:17:42,444
- Excuse me?
- You heard me. Leave him alone.

258
00:17:44,047 --> 00:17:46,607
- This your beeswax?
- You're on our campus.

259
00:17:46,767 --> 00:17:49,520
You can't make racist remarks here.

260
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:53,276
- Who are you to talk to me like that?
- No one. Anyone.

261
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,445
- Get lost!
- Be polite or l call the dean.

262
00:17:56,647 --> 00:17:59,878
Call the Pope while you're at it!

263
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,839
Can you paint, at least?

264
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,835
- l'll shove it down your throat!
- lt's a misunderstanding.

265
00:18:06,007 --> 00:18:08,362
- What's going on?
- He's out of bounds.

266
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,165
He's just a bit excited.

267
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,516
We'll see later.

268
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:14,844
Back to work, gentlemen.
And you, calm down.

269
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,203
Out of my two years in prison,

270
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,643
l spent six months
in a detention center,

271
00:18:38,687 --> 00:18:40,917
and 18 months in a labor camp.

272
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:43,880
That was the worst!

273
00:18:46,007 --> 00:18:50,603
We had to carry heavy stones
from the docks to the boats.

274
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:57,641
ln the morning, we were only allowed
to drink the dirty river water.

275
00:18:59,247 --> 00:19:00,999
But not while we worked.

276
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:06,638
The guards forced the sick prisoners
to spit in our food.

277
00:19:06,807 --> 00:19:10,720
We had to eat in front of them
so we'd get sick ourselves.

278
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:15,119
They selected some of us
to beat with electric shock batons.

279
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,518
Just like that, for no reason,
to scare the others.

280
00:19:19,127 --> 00:19:21,846
l spent a lot of time in isolation.

281
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:27,156
They called it ''jail within jail.''

282
00:19:31,887 --> 00:19:35,243
Torture was part of the routine.

283
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,682
l had chains on my legs.

284
00:19:44,567 --> 00:19:47,001
l could hear my friends' screams

285
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,319
as they were tortured,

286
00:19:50,567 --> 00:19:52,797
while waiting for my turn to come.

287
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:21,440
Forgot your keys again? Great.

288
00:20:26,407 --> 00:20:29,717
- Still working?
- You might say that.

289
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:33,118
- On your law case?
- Our law case.

290
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:40,363
Try using a glass.

291
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,682
You didn't ask Louis-Arnault
for help?

292
00:20:44,327 --> 00:20:46,397
We can't ask him every time.

293
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,842
Good luck. Good night.

294
00:20:50,127 --> 00:20:52,641
The bottle...
Will it put itself away?

295
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,963
lt's me. Can l come in?

296
00:21:12,167 --> 00:21:13,361
Sure.

297
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:19,760
Am l disturbing you?

298
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:22,443
So, how was the conference?

299
00:21:22,607 --> 00:21:25,724
Powerful. Moving testimonies.
l almost cried.

300
00:21:25,887 --> 00:21:29,482
Our problems are nothing
compared to what they've endured.

301
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:33,282
- You just realized life's unfair?
- That what you think?

302
00:21:33,447 --> 00:21:35,483
Not quite, happily.

303
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:38,885
- lt's quite an agenda!
- You should've come.

304
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,925
Another time.
You didn't stay with Agnes?

305
00:21:42,087 --> 00:21:45,523
She was with a group.
So l came home. And the opera?

306
00:21:45,687 --> 00:21:48,599
Sublime! Emeline was in tears.

307
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:52,077
- She didn't stay with you?
- She's not my whole life.

308
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:55,085
- What are you reading?
- Chateaubriand.

309
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:58,398
- You would read Chateaubriand!
- Why?

310
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:01,240
He's a bit...
conventional, isn't he?

311
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:05,561
Here.

312
00:22:06,047 --> 00:22:07,366
Sit down.

313
00:22:07,887 --> 00:22:09,240
Listen to this.

314
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:16,801
Here it is...

315
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,485
His impressions of America.

316
00:22:22,087 --> 00:22:24,760
'English mores follow
the English everywhere.

317
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,725
After crossing regions
without a sign of life,

318
00:22:27,887 --> 00:22:31,197
l spied the sign to an inn
swinging from a branch.

319
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,961
Once,
l entered one of these hostels,

320
00:22:34,127 --> 00:22:37,199
and was stunned to see
a huge circular bed

321
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:39,126
built around a pole.

322
00:22:39,727 --> 00:22:43,515
Each traveler got into the bed,
feet towards the pole,

323
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:47,238
head on the outside of the circle,

324
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,797
so that the sleepers
were laid out symmetrically

325
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:54,039
like the spokes of a wheel
or the ribs of a fan.

326
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,044
After some hesitation,

327
00:22:56,447 --> 00:23:00,360
l got into this contraption,
as there was no one else.

328
00:23:02,687 --> 00:23:04,598
l began to nod off,

329
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:08,204
when l felt something rub
against me.

330
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:18,837
lt was my big Dutchman's leg.''

331
00:23:20,447 --> 00:23:24,326
- You find that conventional?
- No. You're right.

332
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:27,042
l never read him
from that perspective.

333
00:23:28,967 --> 00:23:31,117
Well, then...

334
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:34,841
Good night.

335
00:23:35,487 --> 00:23:36,636
Sleep well.

336
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,882
- What stocks do you have?
- None.

337
00:23:53,047 --> 00:23:55,163
- What?
- l have none.

338
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:57,841
You have no portfolio? No capital?

339
00:23:58,007 --> 00:23:59,679
Not really.

340
00:24:00,247 --> 00:24:01,965
- You're a bad catch?
- And you?

341
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,405
l do more than just speculate.

342
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:08,566
Hey, guys...

343
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:12,037
l forgot a book at the library.
Catch you later?

344
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,681
Sure.

345
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:33,083
- Do you have a minute?
- My friends are waiting.

346
00:24:33,247 --> 00:24:34,839
Do you have a moment, sir?

347
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,840
- No need for formalities.
- So you got a minute.

348
00:24:38,007 --> 00:24:40,680
About the other day,
no need to thank me.

349
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,963
l should've done it in public,
right?

350
00:24:43,127 --> 00:24:44,719
What nonsense!

351
00:24:44,887 --> 00:24:47,447
Time to defend me,
but not listen to me?

352
00:24:50,087 --> 00:24:51,520
Why'd you help me?

353
00:24:51,687 --> 00:24:55,157
l don't know.
lt seemed the right thing to do.

354
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:58,804
Not to everyone.
Your friends didn't react.

355
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:00,798
lt brought back memories.

356
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:03,443
lt'd take too long to explain.

357
00:25:03,607 --> 00:25:06,758
- Buy you a drink?
- No, thanks. Honestly.

358
00:25:07,487 --> 00:25:09,478
Don't wanna be seen with me?

359
00:25:09,887 --> 00:25:11,639
Don't read things into it!

360
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,843
- We can meet Saturday.
- OK.

361
00:25:17,847 --> 00:25:20,919
- Give me your cell number?
- l'll write it down.

362
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:27,002
My name's Mecir.

363
00:25:27,487 --> 00:25:28,715
Call me?

364
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,156
Sure.

365
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,839
Not staying?

366
00:26:24,847 --> 00:26:26,963
l have to study with Chouquet.

367
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:32,443
- On Saturday! Can't it wait a day?
- Tomorrow he's with Yvette.

368
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:35,477
l mean... Eve.

369
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:37,365
An engineering student and ex.

370
00:26:37,527 --> 00:26:41,076
l thought we had a date tonight.
You never stay over.

371
00:26:41,247 --> 00:26:44,159
l'm free tomorrow afternoon.

372
00:26:44,647 --> 00:26:45,796
OK?

373
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:47,962
Tomorrow.

374
00:26:48,127 --> 00:26:50,925
Call me first.
l may not be free, either.

375
00:26:51,327 --> 00:26:52,476
Oh, yeah?

376
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,559
You see? l came.

377
00:27:11,727 --> 00:27:12,921
Let's go.

378
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:17,075
A car!
And you make me take the metro!

379
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:25,399
- This your car?
- Why? Think l stole it?

380
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:30,083
Think we're all dealers? We can't
have cars, credit cards and flats!

381
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,807
- You have all that?
- The flat, not yet.

382
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:35,322
- So where to?
- Relax, you're my guest.

383
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:08,922
lsn't this nice?
lt's like not being in Paris.

384
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:11,396
l don't know Paris.
l'm a provincial.

385
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:13,080
Where you from?

386
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,205
The south, minus the accent.
Carcassonne. And you?

387
00:28:16,367 --> 00:28:19,643
From a village near theirs.
But l was born here.

388
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:27,925
- You drinking orange juice?
- No alcohol. lt's not for athletes.

389
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:30,365
We're not athletes here.

390
00:28:30,727 --> 00:28:32,877
lsn't that why you invited me?

391
00:28:38,527 --> 00:28:41,724
Should l have sent out an invite?
You people do that.

392
00:28:42,527 --> 00:28:44,245
- What do you know?
- What l see.

393
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:47,166
You look so self-confident
yet so uptight.

394
00:28:47,887 --> 00:28:51,163
Well-dressed, but out of style.
Arrogant and proud.

395
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:52,999
Outside of reality.

396
00:28:53,207 --> 00:28:54,879
No wonder the world's a mess.

397
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:56,883
Oh, really?

398
00:28:57,207 --> 00:28:59,198
lf your kind pulls the strings.

399
00:28:59,647 --> 00:29:01,842
lnsensitive and ruthless.

400
00:29:02,007 --> 00:29:04,805
You're judging from appearances.

401
00:29:05,567 --> 00:29:06,716
You're generalizing.

402
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:09,964
Not you. You're not like them.
Though the first time...

403
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:14,086
- The first time?
- l saw you with your redhead friend.

404
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:15,966
Chouquet.

405
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:18,243
You looked pathetic.

406
00:29:18,407 --> 00:29:20,204
l thought l didn't.

407
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:24,679
Relax. Less than him. When you
took my side, l was stunned.

408
00:29:25,007 --> 00:29:28,966
- My dad barked at everyone like him.
- You, too?

409
00:29:30,087 --> 00:29:32,237
Sure. Why not me?

410
00:29:32,447 --> 00:29:34,642
There's a saying where l come from:

411
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:40,246
''Never tame a wolf to make a dog.''
Let's dance.

412
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:55,242
C'mon!

413
00:30:08,687 --> 00:30:10,643
Didn't we have a great time?

414
00:30:11,207 --> 00:30:14,279
- How'd you know l live here?
- You told me.

415
00:30:15,887 --> 00:30:17,240
No, l didn't.

416
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,001
l'm sure l didn't.

417
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,957
l followed you the other day.

418
00:30:25,007 --> 00:30:26,406
What for?

419
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:28,886
Guess.

420
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:33,716
Guess.

421
00:31:43,687 --> 00:31:46,485
So you came home after all!

422
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:50,560
- Waiting up?
- We could've done something together.

423
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,764
- Did we plan on it?
- So we have to plan?

424
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:57,397
- l never know with you.
- lt's time to start knowing.

425
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,319
lsn't that friendship?

426
00:32:23,887 --> 00:32:25,559
ls this your doggie?

427
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:28,725
You'll get dirty here.
Not in school?

428
00:32:28,887 --> 00:32:30,240
l don't have school.

429
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,523
You at the big or little school?

430
00:32:32,687 --> 00:32:34,120
The big school.

431
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:38,679
This is our school.
Look at all this.

432
00:32:38,847 --> 00:32:41,202
And over there. And that's

433
00:32:41,407 --> 00:32:43,523
the cafeteria. What's it for?

434
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:45,718
- To eat.
- Let's give your dog milk.

435
00:32:45,927 --> 00:32:47,076
He doesn't want any.

436
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:51,836
Breaking your daddy's things?
He'll box your ears.

437
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:54,719
Sit down here.

438
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,399
Paul! Come here!

439
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,083
And your dog?

440
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:06,799
l told you to stay with me.

441
00:33:07,447 --> 00:33:10,484
Never play with the workers.
Learn your place.

442
00:33:31,287 --> 00:33:32,800
What is it?

443
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:39,760
Hold me.

444
00:33:41,087 --> 00:33:42,725
Hold me tight.

445
00:34:05,527 --> 00:34:07,438
You're an American banker.

446
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:10,844
A client wants to borrow
a million Swiss francs.

447
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,920
You'll make the loan through a
liquidity swap in US dollars.

448
00:34:15,847 --> 00:34:17,803
Market conditions are as follows...

449
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,606
Excuse me, sir,
but what's a ''swap''?

450
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:26,639
A swap is an item-for-item exchange:
debit, credit...

451
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:32,282
Chouquet?

452
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,281
Bernard?

453
00:34:48,967 --> 00:34:50,764
Louis-Arnault, you there?

454
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:30,158
- What're you up to?
- They're Chouquet's toys.

455
00:37:33,247 --> 00:37:36,205
- You're up early.
- l couldn't sleep.

456
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:38,558
ls it the stress from school?

457
00:37:38,727 --> 00:37:40,160
Not only that.

458
00:37:40,887 --> 00:37:42,320
You're up early, too.

459
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:45,320
l'm training for Sunday's match.
Will you come?

460
00:37:45,487 --> 00:37:48,763
Sure will. l wouldn't miss it.
Want some coffee?

461
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:51,043
Sure. Let me shower first.

462
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:27,997
Your place is as nice as ever.

463
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:29,919
You should come more often.

464
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:33,597
You see? l'm here.

465
00:39:06,967 --> 00:39:08,195
'Morning, honey.

466
00:39:16,447 --> 00:39:19,359
- Sleep well, honey?
- Sure did. l needed it.

467
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:24,361
l Xeroxed articles for your talk.

468
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:26,484
You had time? Thanks.

469
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:27,676
These are great.

470
00:39:29,047 --> 00:39:30,116
l made you toast.

471
00:39:30,727 --> 00:39:32,160
That's sweet.

472
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:36,199
''Discipline and Punish''?

473
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:40,685
My son has me read Foucault
on prisons. Very interesting.

474
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:44,635
l know. We have a classmate
who reads only him.

475
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:46,718
- Who's that?
- Paul Thabor.

476
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:50,521
Do l know him?

477
00:39:50,927 --> 00:39:52,326
Did l meet him, honey?

478
00:39:53,767 --> 00:39:56,998
No. He's a roommate.
He reads more than that.

479
00:39:57,207 --> 00:39:59,562
- We're off.
- Going so soon?

480
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:00,995
We still have time.

481
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:07,796
- See you soon?
- l'll call you.

482
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:09,766
Forgive us.

483
00:40:25,087 --> 00:40:28,716
- What're you doing in here?
- We'll be more comfortable.

484
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:31,284
Not in his room.

485
00:40:31,527 --> 00:40:32,596
Come here.

486
00:40:41,727 --> 00:40:44,844
You often study here alone
all weekend?

487
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:48,204
lt just turned out that way.
l'm not alone. You're here.

488
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,161
- And it just turned out that way?
- What?

489
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,204
Their agreeing to leave together?

490
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:57,006
They didn't leave together
but separately.

491
00:40:57,567 --> 00:40:59,319
- At the same time?
- Not at all.

492
00:40:59,487 --> 00:41:01,842
Chouquet goes home once a month.

493
00:41:02,007 --> 00:41:05,317
Louis-Arnault went to see a regatta
at the last minute.

494
00:41:07,847 --> 00:41:09,997
To leave you alone here

495
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:12,283
and give us free reign.

496
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:17,325
Here or not, what's the difference?
l could've come to your place.

497
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:20,526
What do you mean by ''free reign''?

498
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:23,487
Calling things by their name,
l suppose.

499
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:27,799
Louis-Arnault wasn't sure the regatta
would take place. Uncertain weather.

500
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:31,926
Uncertain weather
for a concerted departure.

501
00:41:32,127 --> 00:41:33,879
lnsomnia distorts things.

502
00:41:34,047 --> 00:41:37,119
Sleepless nights help you
see more clearly.

503
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:40,597
At night, everything is more
intense, more real.

504
00:41:42,807 --> 00:41:46,880
- What're you getting at?
- l've become invisible because of him!

505
00:41:47,047 --> 00:41:49,561
Whatever we do, he's always there.

506
00:41:52,967 --> 00:41:56,084
- Let's make a deal.
- A deal?

507
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,715
Let's see which of us seduces
Louis-Arnault?

508
00:41:58,887 --> 00:42:00,161
- What?
- You heard me.

509
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:02,158
What do you take me for?

510
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:04,397
''Better to burn out than fade away.''
St. Paul.

511
00:42:04,567 --> 00:42:06,922
He never said it.
And nobody's fading.

512
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:10,523
You don't see it.
With me you're sweet, considerate...

513
00:42:10,687 --> 00:42:13,565
But when he appears,
you're transformed.

514
00:42:13,727 --> 00:42:15,638
This isn't funny anymore.

515
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:18,683
All right then.

516
00:42:18,847 --> 00:42:23,318
lf you won't face up to it,
you're more nave than l thought.

517
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,045
Let's sustain the doubt.

518
00:42:25,207 --> 00:42:29,723
Whether you play the game or not,
without you or me knowing it,

519
00:42:29,887 --> 00:42:32,720
let's say l have
Louis-Arnault first.

520
00:42:32,887 --> 00:42:35,720
- Have him?
- That l come and say, 'I had him.''

521
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,003
lf it's him you want him,
take him.

522
00:42:38,167 --> 00:42:42,160
Why try to make me jealous?
You know my feelings haven't changed.

523
00:42:42,407 --> 00:42:44,318
That's what makes me mad!

524
00:42:44,727 --> 00:42:46,399
You're playing with me.

525
00:42:46,767 --> 00:42:50,680
lf l win, l give him up,
but so do you...

526
00:42:51,127 --> 00:42:53,322
Him and all the others to come.

527
00:42:53,487 --> 00:42:56,206
You move in with me in Paris
and that's that.

528
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:59,518
You sleep with him
and you want to live with me?

529
00:43:00,487 --> 00:43:04,639
On the other hand, if it happens,
without your knowing it, of course,

530
00:43:04,807 --> 00:43:07,401
that you happen to have him first,

531
00:43:07,567 --> 00:43:11,401
then l promise to give you up.

532
00:43:12,207 --> 00:43:15,677
Tell me you don't mean a word
of what you say.

533
00:43:16,087 --> 00:43:18,078
Emeline is an added obstacle.

534
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:20,238
Stop it, please!

535
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:27,806
That all the notes you took?

536
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:29,719
Just what interests me.

537
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,798
Meaning, not much.

538
00:43:33,887 --> 00:43:35,878
Come with me to practice?

539
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,685
Right now?

540
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:39,326
Yes, now.

541
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:41,444
lt'll be a nice change.

542
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,640
A nice change!

543
00:43:43,847 --> 00:43:46,281
Get a move on, guys.

544
00:43:47,127 --> 00:43:50,085
Must l remind you
of this season's techniques?

545
00:43:53,367 --> 00:43:55,358
Take your places!

546
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:20,479
ln threes.

547
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:23,239
You too, Louis-Arnault.

548
00:44:57,607 --> 00:44:59,199
You okay? Coming?

549
00:44:59,367 --> 00:45:01,483
- l'll wait.
- Come to the locker room.

550
00:45:01,647 --> 00:45:03,478
- You sure?
- Sure.

551
00:45:39,047 --> 00:45:40,400
Gentlemen,

552
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:43,525
since we have a guest,
let me congratulate you.

553
00:45:47,727 --> 00:45:51,197
Honestly, you practiced today

554
00:45:51,567 --> 00:45:53,239
like a bunch of ballerinas.

555
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:58,119
ls this the synchronized swimming
championship?

556
00:45:58,327 --> 00:46:00,045
- We'll murder 'em.
- Sure.

557
00:46:00,207 --> 00:46:01,686
We're not girls!

558
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,157
Look at how well l'm hung.

559
00:46:04,847 --> 00:46:07,077
He's our captain!

560
00:46:08,487 --> 00:46:12,366
This weekend's game is crucial.
You'd better fire up the team.

561
00:46:12,847 --> 00:46:14,917
Count on us. We'll do fine.

562
00:46:16,207 --> 00:46:18,801
Strong minds, powerful hands!

563
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,279
l'm counting on you.

564
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,722
l don't want to hear it.

565
00:46:28,047 --> 00:46:30,277
Come and shower, coach!

566
00:46:49,367 --> 00:46:51,198
We're all motivated!

567
00:47:30,127 --> 00:47:32,800
Come to breathe the air
of management?

568
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:36,283
For the inter-school meeting.

569
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,802
Right, for that
Texas Death Row convict?

570
00:47:38,967 --> 00:47:42,118
- Yes. You know about it?
- Sure l do.

571
00:47:42,607 --> 00:47:43,835
What do you think?

572
00:47:44,007 --> 00:47:46,965
He's guilty.
After all, he killed his friend.

573
00:47:47,127 --> 00:47:48,845
They haven't proven it.

574
00:47:49,487 --> 00:47:53,082
Don't men feel certain attractions
they won't admit to?

575
00:47:54,207 --> 00:47:57,119
How'd you react
if your guy loved another guy?

576
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,239
No chance of that.

577
00:48:01,407 --> 00:48:04,604
He likes women too much.
A bit too much, even.

578
00:48:04,807 --> 00:48:05,956
But just imagine...

579
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:08,516
lt's crazy.
l never thought about it.

580
00:48:08,727 --> 00:48:11,036
First, l'd feel wounded as a woman.

581
00:48:12,047 --> 00:48:13,844
Then l'd try to understand:

582
00:48:14,527 --> 00:48:16,518
Did l do enough to keep him?

583
00:48:17,927 --> 00:48:19,280
lt rather thrills me.

584
00:48:19,447 --> 00:48:20,960
What do you mean?

585
00:48:21,687 --> 00:48:25,043
We have more than our femininity
to seduce men.

586
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:27,919
And women, too.

587
00:48:29,287 --> 00:48:30,879
l see.

588
00:48:31,047 --> 00:48:34,005
For you,
charm works through the mind.

589
00:48:34,167 --> 00:48:36,806
That's where you Lit people
stump me.

590
00:48:36,967 --> 00:48:40,403
You want to dissect everything,
find meaning everywhere.

591
00:48:40,567 --> 00:48:43,479
l don't agree.
l wasn't raised like that.

592
00:48:43,927 --> 00:48:47,840
- We're not of the same world?
- We're different, that's all.

593
00:48:48,047 --> 00:48:49,162
lt's the guys...

594
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:53,126
With them,
we end up spending time together.

595
00:48:53,287 --> 00:48:55,005
- We might as well...
- Still...

596
00:48:55,407 --> 00:48:58,080
you had time
to form an opinion about me.

597
00:48:58,287 --> 00:49:01,723
Yes, l had time...
And what Louis-Arnault told me.

598
00:49:02,887 --> 00:49:04,445
He talk about me?

599
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:06,082
Sometimes.

600
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:11,319
l'm off to class.

601
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:13,205
See you later.

602
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:20,245
Your coach always like that?

603
00:49:20,407 --> 00:49:23,604
He was overdoing it.
But it's a good team.

604
00:49:23,767 --> 00:49:25,883
True. Real good.

605
00:49:26,367 --> 00:49:28,358
l really have the feeling that...

606
00:49:29,847 --> 00:49:31,883
l should take the offensive more?

607
00:49:32,407 --> 00:49:33,999
Offensive?

608
00:49:34,567 --> 00:49:36,637
To improve team spirit.

609
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:40,439
No, actually...

610
00:49:41,287 --> 00:49:43,164
What l really meant was...

611
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,439
l have to tell you...

612
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:48,925
What?

613
00:49:50,527 --> 00:49:52,199
Should l take up sports?

614
00:49:52,367 --> 00:49:55,040
You should. lt clears the head.

615
00:49:56,007 --> 00:49:57,486
The head?

616
00:49:58,007 --> 00:50:00,282
All that muddle in one's mind.

617
00:50:00,487 --> 00:50:03,399
- Depends on what you call muddle.
- Obviously.

618
00:50:26,047 --> 00:50:27,844
Didn't expect to see me again?

619
00:50:28,647 --> 00:50:31,081
- Are you parked far?
- Over there.

620
00:50:31,247 --> 00:50:32,999
Wanna go for a drive?

621
00:50:34,327 --> 00:50:35,442
lf you want to.

622
00:50:37,687 --> 00:50:38,881
Yes, l want to.

623
00:50:41,527 --> 00:50:43,006
Let's go to the coast.

624
00:50:43,167 --> 00:50:45,476
- When?
- Right now.

625
00:50:45,967 --> 00:50:48,845
- l haven't any money.
- l have my credit card.

626
00:52:58,287 --> 00:52:59,720
Are you OK?

627
00:53:02,527 --> 00:53:05,087
- Thanks for coming down.
- lt's nothing.

628
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:08,284
What do you think?

629
00:53:11,567 --> 00:53:13,080
Effective.

630
00:53:13,527 --> 00:53:14,960
A bit too much so.

631
00:53:15,127 --> 00:53:19,040
That's just like you. Except in
the pool, you never take the plunge.

632
00:53:19,967 --> 00:53:22,037
That's not why you asked me
to come.

633
00:53:22,207 --> 00:53:24,960
No. l suppose you've heard.

634
00:53:26,247 --> 00:53:27,726
Not again!

635
00:53:27,887 --> 00:53:29,320
You don't let up.

636
00:53:29,487 --> 00:53:33,162
There was no evidence.
He may be executed any day now.

637
00:53:33,327 --> 00:53:35,318
Where do l fit in?

638
00:53:35,807 --> 00:53:38,446
l heard that your father...

639
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:41,560
l get it.

640
00:53:42,087 --> 00:53:44,476
He's preparing
the international summit?

641
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:45,966
Affirmative.

642
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:49,324
Ask him to submit this file
to the minister.

643
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,560
He hates being appealed to.
Especially by me.

644
00:53:52,727 --> 00:53:54,797
Then let me make the case to him.

645
00:53:54,967 --> 00:53:56,605
ls that all?

646
00:53:58,327 --> 00:54:00,204
Look, it's a lost cause.

647
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,119
Don't be insensitive.

648
00:54:02,287 --> 00:54:04,721
lnnocent or guilty doesn't matter.

649
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:08,277
- Happily, no. lf there's any hope...
- lt's not up to my dad.

650
00:54:08,447 --> 00:54:11,883
He can gain time for us.
That means a lot. Please...

651
00:54:12,447 --> 00:54:14,119
Help us.

652
00:54:14,447 --> 00:54:16,119
Help me.

653
00:54:29,447 --> 00:54:33,042
lf l do it,
l can't guarantee it'll work.

654
00:54:33,207 --> 00:54:34,686
Of course not.

655
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:37,118
lt's at your own risk.

656
00:54:37,287 --> 00:54:38,925
l'm sure l can convince him.

657
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:46,920
That deserves a small reward.

658
00:54:47,487 --> 00:54:49,000
Already?

659
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:51,278
You don't do anything for free.

660
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:54,605
Let's just say that...

661
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:57,243
l take advantage of the situation.

662
00:55:16,407 --> 00:55:18,477
So l can count on you?

663
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:26,320
Yes, boss.

664
00:55:28,807 --> 00:55:29,922
Want to get a drink?

665
00:55:30,087 --> 00:55:32,396
No time. l have to finish.

666
00:55:33,087 --> 00:55:34,918
Business first.

667
00:55:35,447 --> 00:55:37,278
Know all about it, don't you?

668
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:49,884
There you are.
Have you seen Louis-Arnault?

669
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:53,756
He's supposed to give us
Desvaux's lecture.

670
00:55:53,927 --> 00:55:57,044
- Try the pool.
- He spends his life in the water!

671
00:55:57,207 --> 00:56:00,756
lf you see him, tell him
we're stuck without his notes.

672
00:56:00,927 --> 00:56:03,805
- l have them.
- Can we borrow them?

673
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:06,959
l need them. Tomorrow, if you want.

674
00:56:07,127 --> 00:56:10,676
Problem is, the marketing case
is due tomorrow.

675
00:56:10,847 --> 00:56:13,725
And neither of you could make
the class?

676
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:15,843
Desvaux's a good teacher.

677
00:56:16,487 --> 00:56:20,719
Sure, but we three share the work.
Louis-Arnault was going...

678
00:56:20,887 --> 00:56:22,525
That's not the best way.

679
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:24,837
And when he's no longer around?

680
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,805
Look, we'll ask
Louis-Arnault tonight.

681
00:56:27,967 --> 00:56:29,719
lt's no big deal.

682
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:31,878
Fine. See you later.

683
00:56:35,167 --> 00:56:37,123
- Thanks.
- She needs them!

684
00:56:37,287 --> 00:56:39,482
But they were right here.

685
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:42,036
l'm sure we could've convinced her.

686
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,601
Charity for a former student,
please!

687
00:56:59,727 --> 00:57:01,877
You always let the dishes pile up?

688
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:05,676
lt's Louis-Arnault's turn.
You see him doing dishes?

689
00:57:05,847 --> 00:57:07,758
Not really.

690
00:57:08,367 --> 00:57:09,766
lt's true.

691
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:14,398
Where is he? With all those red
lights, he should've been here first.

692
00:57:14,567 --> 00:57:16,478
Maybe he went jogging first!

693
00:57:16,687 --> 00:57:18,245
He won't be long.

694
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:21,240
Literature's great.
l never remember lines.

695
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,796
lt's a cast of mind, l suppose.

696
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,720
ln fact,
l'm more mathematically minded.

697
00:57:27,767 --> 00:57:29,246
There's a bag missing.

698
00:57:29,407 --> 00:57:31,557
- You sure?
- Positive.

699
00:57:32,247 --> 00:57:34,477
l'll check the car. Be right back.

700
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:36,885
Chouquet, over here!

701
00:57:37,687 --> 00:57:38,563
Help me.

702
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:41,639
What's all this blood?
What happened?

703
00:57:41,807 --> 00:57:43,479
lt's nothing. Help me up.

704
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:46,445
Hold on! What's all this blood?

705
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:49,323
l'll explain later.

706
00:57:50,127 --> 00:57:52,880
You should've come home with us.
Easy!

707
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:56,805
- What happened?
- lt's just a scratch.

708
00:57:56,967 --> 00:58:00,243
- Get some gauze!
- lt's just a little blood.

709
00:58:00,407 --> 00:58:01,920
Sit down.

710
00:58:02,087 --> 00:58:04,078
Sit down. Calm down.

711
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,202
lt's OK.

712
00:58:05,367 --> 00:58:07,005
Let me see.

713
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:13,639
Take this off.

714
00:58:13,807 --> 00:58:15,206
What happened?

715
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:20,045
This won't hurt.

716
00:58:20,887 --> 00:58:22,605
A guy ran into me.

717
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:27,563
l asked him to apologize.
He took it badly and pulled a knife.

718
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:30,156
- A guy in a tux?
- Yeah, a weird guy.

719
00:58:30,327 --> 00:58:31,885
Could you recognize him?

720
00:58:32,047 --> 00:58:34,117
No. lt all happened too fast.

721
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,722
The wound's deeper than it looks.

722
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,155
Wake up!

723
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:41,278
- What's wrong?
- He was attacked.

724
00:58:41,447 --> 00:58:43,802
l'm OK. Where's Emeline?

725
00:58:44,527 --> 00:58:47,166
The hospital!
What're you waiting for?

726
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:50,000
- Not you!
- Get a blanket, quick!

727
00:58:55,047 --> 00:58:57,322
There's no room. Take a cab.

728
00:59:11,087 --> 00:59:13,237
- You took your time.
- l ran...

729
00:59:13,527 --> 00:59:15,483
l had no cash for a cab.

730
00:59:15,647 --> 00:59:17,638
lt's not serious. He's asleep.

731
00:59:17,807 --> 00:59:21,004
- Where are they?
- l got him a private room.

732
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:24,284
- Where?
- Room 20. 5th floor.

733
00:59:24,447 --> 00:59:26,119
l tried to call Emeline...

734
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:33,320
Here he is.

735
00:59:33,487 --> 00:59:36,718
Your hero.
The sleeping hospital beauty.

736
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:38,605
Quiet. You'll wake him.

737
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:40,485
Not a chance.

738
00:59:40,647 --> 00:59:42,558
They gave him sleeping pills.

739
00:59:45,847 --> 00:59:47,280
Don't!

740
00:59:47,727 --> 00:59:50,719
l wouldn't hesitate if l were you.

741
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:53,083
Look how he's sleeping.

742
00:59:53,687 --> 00:59:55,643
How soft he is.

743
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:05,565
At your mercy.
Take advantage of it.

744
01:00:11,807 --> 01:00:14,116
lt's a once-only chance.

745
01:00:15,007 --> 01:00:17,441
Stop it! You know l love you.

746
01:00:27,287 --> 01:00:30,723
We've always been nice,
well-behaved little boys,

747
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:34,840
good at school, hard-working,

748
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,759
home for our snack.

749
01:00:37,327 --> 01:00:40,683
Then we're nice teenagers,
insecure but in style,

750
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:43,281
ready to take exams,
ready to pass them.

751
01:00:43,527 --> 01:00:45,358
And one day they arrive,

752
01:00:45,527 --> 01:00:48,200
pull their knives and...

753
01:00:48,807 --> 01:00:50,001
The world capsizes.

754
01:00:50,487 --> 01:00:53,399
That's enough!
l thought we were going to study.

755
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:55,036
You're studying.

756
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:57,044
The case is due tomorrow.

757
01:00:59,047 --> 01:01:01,242
Don't expect your name on it.

758
01:01:22,847 --> 01:01:24,075
So you're up?

759
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:27,402
Sleep well?

760
01:01:27,567 --> 01:01:30,001
Hard to, with the doors slamming.

761
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:32,642
That was Chouquet.
But he went out.

762
01:01:34,087 --> 01:01:36,123
How you feeling?

763
01:01:38,567 --> 01:01:39,920
OK.

764
01:01:41,207 --> 01:01:43,926
lt still hurts and l have a fever,
but l'm OK.

765
01:01:44,727 --> 01:01:46,718
- Need anything?
- No, thanks.

766
01:01:47,927 --> 01:01:50,487
What happened here?
Did you two argue?

767
01:01:51,687 --> 01:01:54,679
l said our lives hang by a thread.
He stormed out.

768
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:56,041
By a thread?

769
01:01:56,207 --> 01:01:59,517
l meant our folks' sacrifices,
all those years of school...

770
01:01:59,687 --> 01:02:02,997
Our parents' sacrifices?
That's not like you.

771
01:02:03,527 --> 01:02:07,156
We're at the mercy of a knife attack.
That made him furious.

772
01:02:07,327 --> 01:02:08,965
Sure, it's not very original.

773
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:11,687
l doubt it was
the lack of originality.

774
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:16,957
- What're you working on?
- A case study. Didn't get far.

775
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:19,277
l thought you were with Chouquet.

776
01:02:19,447 --> 01:02:21,483
He doesn't understand much.

777
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:22,636
That complicated?

778
01:02:22,807 --> 01:02:25,924
l don't even get the first four
we went over.

779
01:02:26,127 --> 01:02:28,163
- What don't you get?
- The problem.

780
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:31,160
- ''Takover Bid to LBO''?
- l missed the class.

781
01:02:31,327 --> 01:02:34,080
- On the LB0?
- And the one on takeovers.

782
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:37,398
- Didn't you attend any finance class?
- No.

783
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,242
- l see.
- Right. Let's skip it.

784
01:02:40,407 --> 01:02:43,683
Maybe if l read the books
or even Chouquet's notes...

785
01:02:43,887 --> 01:02:46,685
LBOs are designed to thwart
hostile takeovers.

786
01:02:46,847 --> 01:02:48,678
lt's a leverage buy-out.

787
01:02:48,847 --> 01:02:53,796
CEOs team up with finance agents
to head off a hostile takeover.

788
01:02:54,007 --> 01:02:55,360
They buy their own stock.

789
01:02:55,527 --> 01:02:58,200
- With what money?
- A small amount of cash,

790
01:02:58,487 --> 01:03:01,638
and loans on the junk bond market.

791
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:03,838
You know what junk bonds are?

792
01:03:04,847 --> 01:03:06,121
Sure, l do.

793
01:03:06,287 --> 01:03:08,323
The biggest case was RJR Nabisco.

794
01:03:09,487 --> 01:03:13,002
RJ Reynolds tobacco
merges with Nabisco, the food giant.

795
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:14,885
Ritz crackers...

796
01:03:15,287 --> 01:03:16,959
Oh, yeah, crackers.

797
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,915
3 years later, after the biggest
LBO ever, they part ways.

798
01:03:22,047 --> 01:03:25,084
Amount of their takeover
by their immediate predator:

799
01:03:25,247 --> 01:03:28,478
$25 billion... A record.

800
01:03:29,007 --> 01:03:30,042
What for?

801
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:33,922
No more bureaucrats,
no more inept management.

802
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:36,555
But the factories,
personnel and managers?

803
01:03:36,727 --> 01:03:39,719
ln the hands of financiers.
Business engineering is out.

804
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,006
Today, financiers
and corporate lawyers rule.

805
01:03:43,207 --> 01:03:45,960
And the real economy?

806
01:03:46,127 --> 01:03:49,119
Get past
the industrial revolution, OK?

807
01:03:49,687 --> 01:03:51,279
Not OK.

808
01:03:52,127 --> 01:03:55,517
- What?
- l just can't get into it.

809
01:03:55,847 --> 01:03:57,166
Look...

810
01:03:57,327 --> 01:04:01,366
Thanks for your help.
You talk about it with passion,

811
01:04:01,527 --> 01:04:03,961
but, frankly,
it doesn't interest me.

812
01:04:04,127 --> 01:04:06,687
- And your finance case?
- l won't hand it in.

813
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:09,566
- What about the diploma?
- That's just it.

814
01:04:10,087 --> 01:04:12,317
l don't know what's
happening to me.

815
01:04:13,087 --> 01:04:16,841
l was good in Lit,
English and Philosophy.

816
01:04:17,487 --> 01:04:22,481
Lit rated low in provincial schools,
higher than dance but lower than piano.

817
01:04:23,687 --> 01:04:27,919
l wind up here to hear about LBOs.
Where did l go wrong?

818
01:04:28,087 --> 01:04:29,918
What did l do?

819
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:32,125
l didn't see it coming...

820
01:04:32,287 --> 01:04:34,437
l thought you wanted help.

821
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:36,438
You know what would help me?

822
01:04:37,247 --> 01:04:39,124
What would really help me,

823
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:42,035
is that you do it with
my name on it.

824
01:04:43,247 --> 01:04:44,885
You're not serious.

825
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,322
lt's not a reasonable request?

826
01:04:48,207 --> 01:04:51,483
How can you be so reasonable,
so much a part of it?

827
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,119
You're in a bad way.

828
01:04:56,287 --> 01:04:59,643
True. You got stabbed,
l have a knife in my head.

829
01:04:59,847 --> 01:05:03,556
How do you cope with it all?
l just can't.

830
01:05:08,007 --> 01:05:10,077
l need you, Louis-Arnault.

831
01:05:10,247 --> 01:05:12,078
Don't look down on me.

832
01:05:12,247 --> 01:05:14,807
- C'mon, old man...
- What's that supposed to mean?

833
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:18,164
- What?
- None of your buddy-buddy stuff!

834
01:05:18,327 --> 01:05:21,399
Make your gestures meaningful.
That's all l ask.

835
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:39,406
Mother.

836
01:05:40,367 --> 01:05:42,323
- l'm coming in.
- Go around.

837
01:05:43,487 --> 01:05:45,398
What is it? You in pain?

838
01:05:45,567 --> 01:05:47,080
lt's OK. l'm used to it.

839
01:05:47,247 --> 01:05:48,805
l'll take you home.

840
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,400
l'm far from finished.

841
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:53,599
Meeting somebody?
You're all dressed up.

842
01:05:56,127 --> 01:05:57,719
Don't expect me for dinner.

843
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,080
You're in love.

844
01:06:01,487 --> 01:06:02,715
Love, you know...

845
01:06:02,967 --> 01:06:05,879
You're wrong.
Enjoy it now, because later...

846
01:06:07,127 --> 01:06:09,800
- You sure l can go?
- Go on.

847
01:06:23,887 --> 01:06:26,242
- You're late.
- Sorry, it's Louis-Arnault...

848
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:30,196
He was attacked but he'll be OK.
He just needed pampering.

849
01:06:30,367 --> 01:06:31,686
Pampering...

850
01:06:31,847 --> 01:06:33,997
So you're learning with me,

851
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:37,045
practicing to be ready for him,
just in case...

852
01:06:37,407 --> 01:06:38,635
Then l bow out.

853
01:06:38,847 --> 01:06:41,281
What nonsense. You're jealous.

854
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:44,280
No, clear-minded.
You must do the same with Agnes.

855
01:06:44,447 --> 01:06:46,483
How do you know?
You don't know her.

856
01:06:46,647 --> 01:06:49,480
Simple intuition,
from being the token Arab.

857
01:07:00,927 --> 01:07:02,485
- Stop, quick!
- What is it?

858
01:07:02,647 --> 01:07:04,126
lt's important.

859
01:07:09,487 --> 01:07:11,079
What is it?

860
01:07:19,287 --> 01:07:20,481
lt's romantic.

861
01:07:20,927 --> 01:07:23,077
See? That's important.

862
01:07:26,327 --> 01:07:29,239
- You starting to enjoy it?
- Tell me...

863
01:07:30,807 --> 01:07:32,638
How long have you been...

864
01:07:32,807 --> 01:07:33,922
Been what?

865
01:07:34,127 --> 01:07:36,846
A fag? That's not it.

866
01:07:38,847 --> 01:07:42,726
Hetero, homo, all that's out.
lt's meaningless.

867
01:07:43,367 --> 01:07:45,722
lt's because it's you, that's all.

868
01:07:59,527 --> 01:08:01,199
<i>l</i>'<i>m really moved.</i>

869
01:08:01,367 --> 01:08:03,039
<i>You mean a lot to me.</i>

870
01:08:03,207 --> 01:08:05,277
<i>l</i>'<i>m happy with you, too.</i>

872
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:11,844
<i>Hold me tight.</i>

873
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,925
<i>Tight, tight, tight.</i>

874
01:08:16,007 --> 01:08:19,204
<i>Come on. Let</i>'<i>s take a ride</i>
<i>on the merrygo-round.</i>

875
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:21,325
<i>Hold me in your arms.</i>

876
01:08:31,647 --> 01:08:35,242
<i>l want to ride</i>
<i>the merrygo-round. Please.</i>

877
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:38,683
<i>Your snack first.</i>
<i>You haven</i>'<i>t behaved with Mommy.</i>

878
01:08:39,287 --> 01:08:40,879
<i>l have too behaved.</i>

879
01:08:41,047 --> 01:08:43,766
<i>- You</i>'<i>re in love.</i>
<i>- Love, you know...</i>

880
01:08:44,007 --> 01:08:46,043
<i>Enjoy it now, because later...</i>

881
01:08:47,447 --> 01:08:48,675
<i>l don</i>'<i>t have school.</i>

882
01:08:48,847 --> 01:08:50,599
<i>Big or little school?</i>

883
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:52,598
<i>Big school.</i>

884
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,758
<i>Paul, l told you to stay with me.</i>

885
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:56,963
<i>Never play with the workers.</i>

886
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,206
<i>- Your papers!</i>
<i>- Why us?</i>

887
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,198
<i>We didn</i>'<i>t do anything.</i>

888
01:09:01,367 --> 01:09:03,119
<i>You</i>'<i>re Arabs, aren</i>'<i>t you?</i>

889
01:09:03,287 --> 01:09:05,084
<i>Look how well-hung l am.</i>

890
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:08,357
<i>What is it?</i>

891
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:11,724
'<i>It was my big Dutchman</i>'<i>s leg. ''</i>

892
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,767
<i>- Wait. l</i>'<i>m about to come.</i>
<i>- Me, too.</i>

893
01:09:44,207 --> 01:09:45,845
Gorgeous house!

894
01:09:46,007 --> 01:09:49,636
Not our doing. lt's been handed
down through the family.

895
01:09:49,887 --> 01:09:50,922
Have a seat.

896
01:09:55,727 --> 01:09:56,716
No, later.

897
01:09:57,567 --> 01:09:59,398
You seem much better.

898
01:09:59,567 --> 01:10:01,239
l have a fever.

899
01:10:01,407 --> 01:10:03,125
lt still aches.

900
01:10:04,927 --> 01:10:06,519
Want to see?

901
01:10:15,447 --> 01:10:16,562
Don't.

902
01:10:16,727 --> 01:10:19,161
Don't. Your father will come.

903
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:28,801
- My father's in New York.
- What?

904
01:10:29,287 --> 01:10:32,165
- My mother, too.
- You didn't keep your word.

905
01:10:32,367 --> 01:10:34,562
- l did.
- The execution is soon.

906
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:38,398
They're all well aware.
They've already stepped in.

907
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:41,640
- His fate'll be discussed, not changed.
- Meaning?

908
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:43,599
Pressure could backfire.

909
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,037
You lied to get me here.

910
01:10:47,527 --> 01:10:48,642
So we'd be alone.

911
01:10:51,527 --> 01:10:53,165
Let yourself go.

912
01:10:53,687 --> 01:10:55,166
- Stop.
- You want me, too.

913
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:56,442
That's enough!

914
01:10:56,607 --> 01:10:58,962
Because Paul's not here to join in?

915
01:11:00,287 --> 01:11:02,243
What game are you two playing?

916
01:11:02,887 --> 01:11:04,923
What game?

917
01:11:06,287 --> 01:11:08,198
Stop acting innocent.

918
01:11:10,927 --> 01:11:12,440
l know everything.

919
01:11:12,887 --> 01:11:14,957
Do you?

920
01:11:16,087 --> 01:11:19,204
You're using me to see
how far he'll go.

921
01:11:19,767 --> 01:11:21,564
What are you talking about?

922
01:11:22,167 --> 01:11:23,998
You're playing with fire.

923
01:11:24,287 --> 01:11:25,959
You have him in a corner.

924
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:28,243
You're out of your mind.

925
01:11:29,167 --> 01:11:31,522
ls it to keep him or dump him?

926
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:33,678
What are you getting at?

927
01:11:34,247 --> 01:11:35,521
Deep down...

928
01:11:35,687 --> 01:11:38,360
ls it to test his love or yours?

929
01:11:41,647 --> 01:11:43,478
l hit it right on the head.

930
01:11:44,247 --> 01:11:47,000
A change of rules
throws you off-balance.

931
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,083
You're not in control of things.

932
01:11:52,127 --> 01:11:54,004
You hadn't planned on that.

933
01:11:54,767 --> 01:11:59,887
You're nuts. lt's a typical male reaction
to accuse women to regain control.

934
01:12:00,327 --> 01:12:04,878
That how you expect to defeat men?
By destroying their safeguards?

935
01:12:05,047 --> 01:12:07,720
Defeat? We're not at war.

936
01:12:08,887 --> 01:12:10,718
The silent war of the sexes.

937
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:15,081
A man's at a disadvantage
for not knowing what a woman is.

938
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:19,441
While we know a man's secrets
because we created him.

939
01:12:20,807 --> 01:12:22,957
Try and uncover secrets,

940
01:12:23,767 --> 01:12:25,917
and they crumble away,

941
01:12:26,607 --> 01:12:28,404
leaving you naked.

942
01:12:32,887 --> 01:12:34,206
This'll get us nowhere.

943
01:12:37,767 --> 01:12:40,042
lt's the best place to return from.

944
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:44,240
Think about yourself.

945
01:12:44,807 --> 01:12:46,399
About us.

946
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:49,483
Let Paul wallow in his anguish.

947
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:16,164
<i>This season feels strange.</i>

948
01:13:17,367 --> 01:13:19,722
<i>lt</i>'<i>s the best time of year,</i>
<i>back home.</i>

949
01:13:19,887 --> 01:13:22,401
<i>lt</i>'<i>s like Christmas. lt</i>'<i>s sacred.</i>

950
01:13:24,167 --> 01:13:25,646
<i>lt</i>'<i>s still mild.</i>

951
01:13:25,807 --> 01:13:28,879
<i>The leaves have changed color.</i>
<i>The vines, especially.</i>

952
01:13:29,047 --> 01:13:32,084
<i>Walking in the vineyards.</i>
<i>All those reds.</i>

953
01:13:32,247 --> 01:13:34,602
<i>And the yellowish green pine trees.</i>

954
01:13:34,967 --> 01:13:38,437
<i>l walk with my parents and talk.</i>

955
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:40,918
<i>l</i>'<i>m afraid of what l might say.</i>

956
01:13:41,087 --> 01:13:44,523
<i>l watch them walk away,</i>
<i>or come toward me.</i>

957
01:13:45,407 --> 01:13:46,886
<i>They</i>'<i>re so handsome!</i>

958
01:13:47,047 --> 01:13:49,163
<i>They were young once.</i>

959
01:13:49,527 --> 01:13:52,599
<i>l want to hug them.</i>

960
01:13:53,167 --> 01:13:54,885
<i>To shout to them.</i>

961
01:13:56,247 --> 01:13:59,557
<i>What if we were dogs?</i>
<i>A family of dogs?</i>

962
01:14:00,247 --> 01:14:02,966
<i>You licked me so much</i>
<i>when l came out of you.</i>

963
01:14:03,127 --> 01:14:06,517
<i>And now l</i>'<i>m licking another dog.</i>

964
01:14:06,687 --> 01:14:09,645
<i>l licked his snout</i>
<i>and let him lick me all over.</i>

965
01:14:09,807 --> 01:14:14,085
<i>And because of that, you won</i>'<i>t</i>
<i>take me by the neck and carry me?</i>

966
01:14:14,247 --> 01:14:16,761
<i>You</i>'<i>ll bare your teeth?</i>
<i>We</i>'<i>ll all look mad?</i>

967
01:14:16,927 --> 01:14:20,636
<i>We</i>'<i>re not dogs. We</i>'<i>re not even dogs.</i>

968
01:14:22,247 --> 01:14:24,283
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Thabor.</i>

969
01:14:24,447 --> 01:14:25,675
<i>Their son Paul</i>

970
01:14:26,487 --> 01:14:29,684
<i>is the graduate of a famous school.</i>

971
01:15:25,207 --> 01:15:26,322
You OK?

972
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:38,956
Want one?

973
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:48,844
Sleep well?

974
01:15:49,207 --> 01:15:51,038
l had such a strange dream.

975
01:15:55,527 --> 01:15:58,724
- Tell me about it.
- lt was...

976
01:15:59,127 --> 01:16:00,845
<i>like feeling weightless.</i>

977
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:03,918
<i>They</i>'<i>d handcuffed me.</i>

978
01:16:20,327 --> 01:16:24,161
<i>One should know better</i>
<i>than to expect anything of mankind.</i>

979
01:16:24,327 --> 01:16:26,443
<i>Only one</i>'<i>s own downfall.</i>

980
01:16:37,167 --> 01:16:38,646
<i>The soldiers separated us.</i>

981
01:16:38,847 --> 01:16:42,283
The chain around my neck was gone.
You had it now.

982
01:16:42,447 --> 01:16:43,766
l must give it to you.

983
01:16:43,927 --> 01:16:47,806
- But it's from your mother!
- Exactly. lt's precious to me.

984
01:16:50,007 --> 01:16:52,840
So long as you wear it,
l'll protect you.

985
01:16:53,767 --> 01:16:54,882
What will you say?

986
01:16:55,207 --> 01:16:57,960
That you lost it? Gave it away?

987
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,479
You know, there's so much
l'd like to say.

988
01:17:05,527 --> 01:17:08,041
With parents, it's always too late.

989
01:17:08,207 --> 01:17:11,882
You realize you haven't
loved them enough or said enough.

990
01:17:12,727 --> 01:17:14,604
My mother, poor woman...

991
01:17:15,247 --> 01:17:18,080
l'll never earn enough
so she can quit.

992
01:17:18,807 --> 01:17:22,482
To send her on a trip.
All she knows is here and back home.

993
01:17:22,927 --> 01:17:25,999
She breaks her back
so you can sit on clean chairs.

994
01:17:32,967 --> 01:17:35,083
Would you let me meet your parents?

995
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:38,006
- Why?
- Not even as a friend?

996
01:17:38,567 --> 01:17:42,276
You don't know my father.
Me having a worker as a friend!

997
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,040
And an Arab, to boot.

998
01:17:44,207 --> 01:17:46,767
Say l'm from a famous school, too.

999
01:17:46,927 --> 01:17:48,883
Oh, yeah? Which one?

1000
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:51,322
Don't believe me? lt's nearby.

1001
01:17:51,527 --> 01:17:53,677
- What're you talking about?
- C'mon.

1002
01:18:04,007 --> 01:18:05,884
- There it is.
- But that's life!

1003
01:18:06,087 --> 01:18:08,123
Right! lt's the best school.

1004
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,399
l worked on a site here.

1005
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:12,479
l learned a lot.

1006
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:16,956
Open your eyes.
Look at things differently. Observe.

1007
01:19:20,007 --> 01:19:23,124
- What a fabulous place!
- And there's more to it.

1008
01:19:23,287 --> 01:19:25,642
- You been here before?
- No!

1009
01:19:29,087 --> 01:19:30,486
Now it's gone!

1010
01:19:35,767 --> 01:19:37,439
Cut your card tricks!

1011
01:19:38,247 --> 01:19:40,556
Mrs. Réal, Paul Thabor...

1012
01:19:40,727 --> 01:19:42,206
His friend, Agnes.

1013
01:19:44,367 --> 01:19:48,519
- Your husband isn't here?
- He's stuck in Brussels. He's sorry.

1014
01:19:48,687 --> 01:19:50,996
So you're my son's roommate.

1015
01:19:51,647 --> 01:19:53,842
Such an interest in my father!

1016
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:56,043
We didn't need him.

1017
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,885
Happy birthday, honey.

1018
01:20:28,927 --> 01:20:30,406
My darling!

1019
01:20:40,927 --> 01:20:43,725
- What're you doing?
- We'll find a bedroom.

1020
01:20:43,887 --> 01:20:47,243
- No, not here.
- Yes, here. ln his home.

1021
01:20:47,407 --> 01:20:48,601
C'mon...

1022
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:28,439
ls this yours?

1023
01:21:28,607 --> 01:21:29,722
lt was a gift.

1024
01:21:29,887 --> 01:21:31,764
From whom? Louis-Arnault?

1025
01:21:32,127 --> 01:21:33,924
Sure, from Louis-Arnault.

1026
01:21:34,087 --> 01:21:37,238
Come here, Louis-Arnault.
l want you, Louis-Arnault.

1027
01:21:38,047 --> 01:21:39,878
You and your Louis-Arnault!

1028
01:21:41,927 --> 01:21:43,645
lt's literally intoxicating.

1029
01:21:45,127 --> 01:21:46,799
So be nice.

1030
01:21:47,847 --> 01:21:49,997
We're not into exchanging gifts.

1031
01:21:50,167 --> 01:21:52,283
lt's his birthday, not mine.

1032
01:21:54,767 --> 01:21:56,723
lt's a gift from me.

1033
01:21:56,887 --> 01:21:59,355
l gave myself one since
you never do.

1034
01:22:00,207 --> 01:22:01,356
Dummy.

1035
01:22:01,767 --> 01:22:05,601
lt's true. l was walking by a store.
The chain saw me.

1036
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:07,758
lt said: Come in!

1037
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:12,436
l'll bring you happiness.

1038
01:22:12,607 --> 01:22:14,723
Just wear me around your neck.

1039
01:22:14,887 --> 01:22:18,323
l'll protect you.
l'll love you forever.

1040
01:22:31,167 --> 01:22:34,125
- Where've you been?
- Relax, l'm not late.

1041
01:22:34,887 --> 01:22:37,845
- You OK? What is it?
- l argued with Dad.

1042
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:41,477
He gets me down.
He says musician isn't a job.

1043
01:22:41,687 --> 01:22:44,804
- He doesn't believe in me.
- He wants you to succeed.

1044
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:48,039
l don't want to admit
no one cares about me.

1045
01:22:48,207 --> 01:22:51,165
- Cut the paranoia.
- That's exactly paranoia.

1046
01:22:51,367 --> 01:22:53,244
You resent others

1047
01:22:53,407 --> 01:22:56,160
to forget that you mean
nothing to them.

1048
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:58,565
Believe in yourself first!

1049
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:01,446
Then you'll see others differently.

1050
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:04,004
l believe in what l do.

1051
01:23:04,567 --> 01:23:07,684
That's what gives me fire,
it gives me strength.

1052
01:23:36,167 --> 01:23:37,395
Where to?

1053
01:23:37,927 --> 01:23:39,679
Just drive along the river.

1054
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:41,485
You sure?

1055
01:25:07,967 --> 01:25:10,242
Keep it down.
You'll wake the others.

1056
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,245
How'd you get in?

1057
01:25:14,687 --> 01:25:16,518
Paul gave me the key.

1058
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:19,037
But l didn't come to see him.

1059
01:25:19,967 --> 01:25:22,162
l was sure you'd hear me.

1060
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:25,919
Changed your mind?

1061
01:25:29,087 --> 01:25:31,078
But l have no choice now.

1062
01:25:31,807 --> 01:25:33,923
l have to see it through.

1063
01:25:34,847 --> 01:25:35,996
For him.

1064
01:25:36,167 --> 01:25:38,727
For me. For us.

1065
01:25:39,367 --> 01:25:41,881
Through me he gets
what he wants from you.

1066
01:25:42,047 --> 01:25:44,561
Funny alibi.
lt won't change anything.

1067
01:25:44,727 --> 01:25:48,515
- You can't understand.
- Then call him so he can see us.

1068
01:25:48,687 --> 01:25:50,279
Emeline's here too.

1069
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:53,525
Yes, but she's sleeping. Like Paul.

1070
01:25:54,127 --> 01:25:56,038
He's asleep, too.

1071
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:59,684
Only you woke up.
l knew you would.

1072
01:26:01,447 --> 01:26:03,881
So the inevitable could happen.

1073
01:26:16,247 --> 01:26:17,839
Come to bed now.

1074
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:22,886
l missed the stabbing.
So l lose you for being a bit late?

1075
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:25,607
Lose me?
After 20 years of marriage, maybe.

1076
01:26:25,767 --> 01:26:28,679
- And our private life?
- No reason to make a scene.

1077
01:26:28,847 --> 01:26:32,123
A scene? Did you forget
everything between us?

1078
01:26:33,447 --> 01:26:35,199
l know what's between us.

1079
01:26:36,127 --> 01:26:39,039
Sex joins but it doesn't commit you.

1080
01:26:39,207 --> 01:26:40,117
Excuse me?

1081
01:26:40,287 --> 01:26:42,847
Sex is a world apart.
Like Greek or Math.

1082
01:26:43,007 --> 01:26:44,679
l'm not talking to you.

1083
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,839
Let's just say he wanted me
and l wanted him.

1084
01:26:50,207 --> 01:26:53,597
And my desire?
You haven't always spurned it.

1085
01:26:53,767 --> 01:26:57,203
We're joined.
By being joined we're committed.

1086
01:26:57,367 --> 01:26:59,722
There are feelings binding us.

1087
01:26:59,887 --> 01:27:02,196
And there's a difference
of sensibility.

1088
01:27:02,367 --> 01:27:04,517
Not even. Of talent. Dexterity.

1089
01:27:04,807 --> 01:27:07,879
She may have more talent
for expressing feelings.

1090
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:09,321
Or for hiding them.

1091
01:27:09,487 --> 01:27:13,162
Maybe she has no feelings.
She's just playing a game.

1092
01:27:14,767 --> 01:27:16,644
Play is all she can do.

1093
01:27:16,887 --> 01:27:18,843
We're always playing
someone's game.

1094
01:27:19,007 --> 01:27:22,522
Don't they teach you to play
with people to dominate them?

1095
01:27:22,687 --> 01:27:26,282
He isn't playing!
Are you, Louis-Arnault?

1096
01:27:26,887 --> 01:27:28,445
Answer me.

1097
01:27:29,327 --> 01:27:31,682
Am l playing? Look at me!

1098
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:35,522
You had to turn up now
to make this scene...

1099
01:27:36,207 --> 01:27:37,845
This impossible scene!

1100
01:28:00,287 --> 01:28:03,438
You don't talk,
but you make yourself understood.

1101
01:28:03,607 --> 01:28:07,043
Nice speech about spurned desire.
What a Freudian slip!

1102
01:28:07,207 --> 01:28:10,005
l shouldn't have come.
Lucky she came in.

1103
01:28:10,167 --> 01:28:12,806
There are things that kill desire.

1104
01:28:12,967 --> 01:28:14,480
l'm leaving.

1105
01:28:15,727 --> 01:28:18,002
Wait for the first train at <i>6</i>.

1106
01:28:18,767 --> 01:28:20,644
- Paul won't know.
- Won't he?

1107
01:28:20,807 --> 01:28:22,365
Then everything's fine.

1108
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:34,125
For your taxi.

1109
01:28:34,287 --> 01:28:37,563
Oh, right!
l don't pay, l didn't have anything.

1110
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:42,605
lf you change your mind,
there's Scotch tape.

1111
01:29:21,407 --> 01:29:23,762
- Going to the <i>Normale Sup</i> party?
- No.

1112
01:29:23,927 --> 01:29:26,760
- We go together or l don't go.
- Why not?

1113
01:29:26,927 --> 01:29:28,519
Agnes is your girlfriend.

1114
01:29:29,007 --> 01:29:30,565
And your best friend.

1115
01:29:30,727 --> 01:29:34,276
Sure. She has to be either
a girlfriend or a best friend.

1116
01:29:34,447 --> 01:29:36,517
Funny way to talk.

1117
01:29:36,687 --> 01:29:39,918
Who'd want to be a girlfriend
when she can be a best friend?

1118
01:29:40,087 --> 01:29:43,796
Yet when the word 'friend' follows,
what's best is obvious.

1119
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:46,480
What'd she say?

1120
01:29:46,647 --> 01:29:49,036
- About what?
- About me.

1121
01:29:49,807 --> 01:29:52,321
You two did the talking
the other night.

1122
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:54,045
ls that it?

1123
01:29:54,207 --> 01:29:55,959
No other factors?

1124
01:29:56,127 --> 01:29:57,640
Like what?

1125
01:29:58,247 --> 01:30:01,159
You're on the wrong track.
And forgetting Emeline.

1126
01:30:35,527 --> 01:30:37,438
Nice of you to visit.

1127
01:30:39,087 --> 01:30:41,555
- A mere coincidence.
- l don't doubt it.

1128
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:49,005
- We've met?
- On campus. Painting.

1129
01:30:49,167 --> 01:30:50,759
That's right.

1130
01:30:50,927 --> 01:30:52,076
What brings you here?

1131
01:30:52,327 --> 01:30:55,239
The library. And you?

1132
01:30:55,407 --> 01:30:59,480
l'm working as a mason on this site.
But l told you that!

1133
01:31:00,167 --> 01:31:02,806
lt's my break. Want to have a drink?

1134
01:31:02,967 --> 01:31:04,241
Why not?

1135
01:31:04,407 --> 01:31:06,125
l'm waiting for my brother.

1136
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:09,400
There's a café nearby.
Here he comes.

1137
01:31:11,127 --> 01:31:12,685
How're things?

1138
01:31:13,967 --> 01:31:15,480
This is Paul.

1139
01:31:16,247 --> 01:31:17,680
l think we've met.

1140
01:31:20,247 --> 01:31:21,805
What're you doing?

1141
01:31:22,007 --> 01:31:24,202
He's the guy who stabbed me!

1142
01:31:24,367 --> 01:31:25,880
l didn't do anything!

1143
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:27,446
Stop! He's my brother!

1144
01:31:27,647 --> 01:31:30,445
- l recognize him!
- You got the wrong man!

1145
01:31:34,807 --> 01:31:35,842
l'm OK, let me go.

1146
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:38,885
lt's not him.
He couldn't do a thing like that.

1147
01:31:39,047 --> 01:31:40,605
Leave me alone.

1148
01:32:08,047 --> 01:32:10,038
- Let me explain.
- Explain what?

1149
01:32:10,207 --> 01:32:13,165
- You let him go.
- You don't get it!

1150
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:15,722
- lt was for you.
- l did get it.

1151
01:32:16,927 --> 01:32:19,805
My shorts aren't enough.
You sleep with <i>that</i>!

1152
01:32:25,207 --> 01:32:27,721
You know l love you

1153
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:29,646
and you said nothing?

1154
01:32:30,727 --> 01:32:32,080
ln your opinion,

1155
01:32:32,247 --> 01:32:34,317
what would l do if l loved you?

1156
01:32:35,207 --> 01:32:37,038
What would l do?

1157
01:32:57,007 --> 01:32:58,281
C'mon! lt's pointless.

1158
01:32:58,447 --> 01:33:00,119
Leave me alone.

1159
01:33:00,287 --> 01:33:03,324
My brother couldn't have!
He'd have told me.

1160
01:33:03,487 --> 01:33:06,001
Him or another,
it doesn't matter now.

1161
01:33:10,207 --> 01:33:12,243
Don't cry.

1162
01:33:12,527 --> 01:33:15,325
lt's not worth it.
See how he treated you?

1163
01:33:15,487 --> 01:33:18,718
Stop it! You'll ruin everything.

1164
01:33:19,687 --> 01:33:22,759
- You can't prefer him!
- This isn't the time.

1165
01:33:23,607 --> 01:33:26,804
He lied to separate us,
to break with you.

1166
01:33:27,407 --> 01:33:29,762
l'm here... to protect you.

1167
01:33:31,847 --> 01:33:33,599
- That's enough.
- No, don't!

1168
01:33:34,447 --> 01:33:35,596
Keep it.

1169
01:33:35,807 --> 01:33:37,399
lt's no good to me now.

1170
01:33:37,727 --> 01:33:39,604
Don't part with it.

1171
01:33:40,687 --> 01:33:42,405
Tell me l'll see you again.

1172
01:33:42,567 --> 01:33:45,764
We'll keep going.
You can lie to me, but say it.

1173
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:48,436
We'll see.

1174
01:33:48,967 --> 01:33:50,958
l'm so confused.

1175
01:33:52,367 --> 01:33:53,800
l need to be alone.

1176
01:33:54,767 --> 01:33:56,041
Alone.

1177
01:34:00,447 --> 01:34:02,483
You mean a lot to me.

1178
01:34:02,887 --> 01:34:04,320
l love you.

1179
01:34:51,207 --> 01:34:52,401
So it's come to this?

1180
01:34:52,567 --> 01:34:54,364
Why are you so surprised?

1181
01:34:54,727 --> 01:34:58,276
He's moving in with me.
ls it so hard to understand?

1182
01:34:58,447 --> 01:35:00,244
lt's obviously easy for you.

1183
01:35:00,767 --> 01:35:02,758
You weren't so sure that night.

1184
01:35:02,927 --> 01:35:04,485
There's no connection.

1185
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:07,081
l knew Agnes wanted Louis-Arnault.

1186
01:35:07,487 --> 01:35:08,761
l put things in order.

1187
01:35:13,167 --> 01:35:17,240
The Louis-Arnault you dreamed about...
you lost him that night.

1188
01:35:17,527 --> 01:35:20,883
You don't know him.
You can't imagine.

1189
01:35:21,047 --> 01:35:24,198
lmagine what? Your reconciliation?

1190
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:27,040
How he held you?
How gentle he was?

1191
01:35:27,247 --> 01:35:30,125
How touching? How he promised?

1192
01:35:30,287 --> 01:35:31,640
How he almost cried?

1193
01:35:31,847 --> 01:35:33,280
l can imagine it!

1194
01:35:33,447 --> 01:35:35,642
- You talk about him as if...
- Yes.

1195
01:35:48,247 --> 01:35:50,078
l wondered what you were up to.

1196
01:35:50,247 --> 01:35:51,885
l was about to leave.

1197
01:35:52,567 --> 01:35:54,876
l figured you couldn't carry it all.

1198
01:35:58,767 --> 01:36:00,166
Find a place?

1199
01:36:00,327 --> 01:36:03,524
l'll be at Emeline's.
Or at my folks.

1200
01:36:03,687 --> 01:36:05,166
You can stay with me.

1201
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:07,283
l didn't see you at the party.

1202
01:36:07,447 --> 01:36:09,199
We weren't up to it.

1203
01:36:09,367 --> 01:36:11,039
- Was it fun?
- Terrific.

1204
01:36:11,247 --> 01:36:14,284
Lit students have a ball.
Agnes danced like crazy.

1205
01:36:14,487 --> 01:36:16,159
The white knight is back?

1206
01:36:17,127 --> 01:36:19,357
Speak of the devil.
What a coincidence.

1207
01:36:19,527 --> 01:36:20,960
So it seemed.

1208
01:36:21,127 --> 01:36:23,243
l didn't expect you this weekend.

1209
01:36:23,407 --> 01:36:25,796
Neither did l. The weekend's over.

1210
01:36:25,967 --> 01:36:28,037
Amazing we're up after last night.

1211
01:36:28,207 --> 01:36:29,560
l didn't go to bed.

1212
01:36:29,727 --> 01:36:31,445
lt's not the first time.

1213
01:36:32,567 --> 01:36:37,004
l went to the movies. A couple
were making love next to me.

1214
01:36:39,647 --> 01:36:41,080
Basically, you see...

1215
01:36:41,247 --> 01:36:44,159
The dream life you're planning...

1216
01:36:44,327 --> 01:36:47,285
may not be very admirable
or very virile.

1217
01:36:47,447 --> 01:36:49,961
- What was that?
- He doesn't mean you.

1218
01:36:50,127 --> 01:36:52,925
l may have a dated sense
of chivalry...

1219
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:55,555
- Chivalry?
- What's he mean?

1220
01:36:55,727 --> 01:36:58,446
- The crusades, probably.
- lsn't that it?

1221
01:36:58,607 --> 01:37:00,802
Being good in finance,

1222
01:37:00,967 --> 01:37:05,006
looking down on marketing...
lt's all a bit common, isn't it?

1223
01:37:05,167 --> 01:37:06,646
And you talk of virility?

1224
01:37:06,807 --> 01:37:09,924
We used to understand each other,
we were in synch.

1225
01:37:10,087 --> 01:37:12,282
Then your eyes shone for Nabisco...

1226
01:37:12,447 --> 01:37:15,007
- What d'you mean by ''virility''?
- Financier,

1227
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:18,045
corporate lawyer
in an international firm.

1228
01:37:18,367 --> 01:37:21,120
Meals, contracts,
seminars, executive dinners,

1229
01:37:21,287 --> 01:37:25,644
call girls, soundproof hotel rooms
with champagne in the mini-bar...

1230
01:37:25,807 --> 01:37:27,604
Life... Life!

1231
01:37:28,847 --> 01:37:31,486
Answer him!

1232
01:37:31,647 --> 01:37:35,640
What's left for us
if guys like you can't answer him?

1233
01:37:36,887 --> 01:37:38,878
What do you want me to do?

1234
01:37:40,167 --> 01:37:41,759
Punch him in the face?

1235
01:37:41,927 --> 01:37:44,600
Are you so pathetic
you have nothing to say?

1236
01:37:44,767 --> 01:37:47,884
Can't you see
he's missing the heart of the issue?

1237
01:37:48,807 --> 01:37:52,482
Negotiations,
psychological warfare, secrets,

1238
01:37:52,647 --> 01:37:55,639
strategies, signatures,
victory, noble things!

1239
01:37:55,807 --> 01:37:57,559
Can't you tell him that?

1240
01:38:00,287 --> 01:38:01,402
And you, Paul?

1241
01:38:01,567 --> 01:38:05,276
What will you do that's so great?
You'll fall in line.

1242
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:11,437
You're both the same:
always dissecting things.

1243
01:38:11,607 --> 01:38:14,167
You wouldn't mind
if he punched him out.

1244
01:38:14,327 --> 01:38:16,966
But it's Paul
who used the word ''virile.''

1245
01:38:17,127 --> 01:38:19,846
Yes, l did.
l'm not sure you heard it.

1246
01:38:20,007 --> 01:38:21,884
And that changes its meaning?

1247
01:38:22,047 --> 01:38:26,165
So your dear Emeline
can express an idea, after all.

1248
01:38:26,327 --> 01:38:28,238
You should manage, too.

1249
01:39:16,167 --> 01:39:17,486
Well?

1250
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:26,361
Got what you wanted?

1251
01:39:26,567 --> 01:39:28,398
l could've had him.

1252
01:39:29,207 --> 01:39:31,357
- But you didn't.
- l hesitated.

1253
01:39:31,567 --> 01:39:34,286
- Because of your bet?
- You were in on it?

1254
01:39:34,487 --> 01:39:35,920
- And you?
- lt was for you.

1255
01:39:36,087 --> 01:39:38,237
- Even that night?
- You heard it all?

1256
01:39:38,967 --> 01:39:41,720
- lmpossible not to.
- Bernard slept through it.

1257
01:39:42,247 --> 01:39:44,238
Chouquet uses earplugs.

1258
01:39:44,407 --> 01:39:47,080
And those airplane eye masks.

1259
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,807
He barricades his head to sleep.

1260
01:39:50,327 --> 01:39:51,555
Emeline woke me.

1261
01:39:52,327 --> 01:39:54,887
You'd have gone on but
she walked in.

1262
01:39:55,047 --> 01:39:57,117
l would have done it for you.

1263
01:39:57,327 --> 01:40:00,524
You'd have won by saying:
l had him!

1264
01:40:01,807 --> 01:40:03,957
Well, l did have him.

1265
01:40:04,487 --> 01:40:05,966
What?

1266
01:40:06,327 --> 01:40:07,442
l had Louis-Arnault.

1267
01:40:07,687 --> 01:40:09,803
- What?
- As l told you.

1268
01:40:11,447 --> 01:40:13,642
Liar! Bernard said you argued.

1269
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:15,480
That's why.

1270
01:40:15,647 --> 01:40:18,878
He came home drunk Thursday,
looking for me.

1271
01:40:19,327 --> 01:40:22,319
And you took advantage.
Want me to believe that?

1272
01:40:22,487 --> 01:40:23,966
That's right.

1273
01:40:24,447 --> 01:40:26,915
Why would he drink?
lt's not like him.

1274
01:40:27,087 --> 01:40:29,726
As an excuse
for what he was going to do.

1275
01:40:29,887 --> 01:40:33,721
He did nothing. l'm almost positive
he doesn't want anything.

1276
01:40:33,887 --> 01:40:35,923
You're right to say 'àlmost.''

1277
01:40:36,567 --> 01:40:38,285
So he came looking for you?

1278
01:40:38,447 --> 01:40:41,723
He wanted to check his notes
against mine.

1279
01:40:42,167 --> 01:40:43,805
We looked at the case.

1280
01:40:43,967 --> 01:40:46,527
He dropped his hand, let it wander.

1281
01:40:47,887 --> 01:40:51,277
lt's not true.
He's not at all like that.

1282
01:40:51,687 --> 01:40:55,566
But in male sexuality,
there's something automatic.

1283
01:40:55,887 --> 01:40:57,036
Automatic?

1284
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:59,721
lt doesn't matter
whose hand does the stroking,

1285
01:40:59,887 --> 01:41:01,718
if all you want is a reaction.

1286
01:41:02,927 --> 01:41:04,838
Thanks for the details!

1287
01:41:05,567 --> 01:41:08,957
The details say more
than all the rest.

1288
01:41:13,007 --> 01:41:15,919
The gesture explains
the step one takes.

1289
01:41:16,887 --> 01:41:20,800
So what you do when we're together
is just automatic?

1290
01:41:20,967 --> 01:41:22,719
You know it isn't.

1291
01:41:23,767 --> 01:41:26,998
Louis-Arnault won't try it again.

1292
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:28,839
But just once in his life.

1293
01:41:29,007 --> 01:41:32,079
You made the rules:
once was enough.

1294
01:41:32,287 --> 01:41:33,925
l don't believe you.

1295
01:41:34,527 --> 01:41:36,677
l don't believe a word of all this.

1296
01:41:36,847 --> 01:41:39,042
You have to take my word for it.

1297
01:41:39,647 --> 01:41:43,037
So it's all said and done?
You got what you wanted?

1298
01:41:44,607 --> 01:41:46,757
Say we haven't lost everything.

1299
01:41:47,607 --> 01:41:49,199
l don't know.

1300
01:41:50,407 --> 01:41:53,205
We have something between us.

1301
01:41:53,367 --> 01:41:55,358
Our complicity.

1302
01:41:56,247 --> 01:41:58,602
You say things that are rarely said.

1303
01:41:59,247 --> 01:42:03,957
Between a man and a woman, we invent
nothing more than what binds us.

1304
01:42:04,767 --> 01:42:07,156
We invent... desire.

1305
01:42:08,287 --> 01:42:10,562
Maybe we should come back to that.

1306
01:42:35,567 --> 01:42:39,196
<i>l want to be able to choose</i>
<i>so as not to have to choose.</i>

1307
01:43:20,487 --> 01:43:22,557
<i>Now l walk</i>

1308
01:43:22,767 --> 01:43:26,885
<i>with my head in the stars,</i>
<i>to keep my tears from falling.</i>
