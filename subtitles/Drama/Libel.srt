<i>London, in 1959.</i>

00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:14,985
- Gotta match?
- No. I'm sorry, I don't smoke.

5
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:21,951
- Hello boy.
- Pinka.

6
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,746
- Pink. Thank you.
- Hello, is this yours?

7
00:02:24,873 --> 00:02:27,393
- Yes, he is always doing that.
- He is very friendly.

8
00:02:27,474 --> 00:02:30,174
Don't you believe it.
He bit a man last week.

9
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,888
I'm glad, he is in a better
mood tonight.

10
00:02:33,013 --> 00:02:34,083
Come on.

11
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,560
Good boy.

12
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:44,333
- On top form tonight Fred?
- I can't do a thing right.

13
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,960
- Good evening, Betty!
- Hello Maisie!

14
00:02:47,716 --> 00:02:51,716
- Would you care for a drink?
- Thanks. I usually have a gin and tonic.

15
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:54,646
Good. A gin and tonic and a beer, please?
Coming up!

16
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:58,835
- Are you in town for long?
- No, just two days between clients.

17
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:01,352
- Have you been to London before?
- Yes, yes.

18
00:03:01,396 --> 00:03:03,276
- I was here during the war.
- Really?

19
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,371
Hey Maisie, I haven't seen you
for days. How have you been?

20
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,321
- Three and three, sir.
- Thank you.

21
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:11,697
- Gin!
- Thank you. Cheers!

22
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:13,689
- Cheers!
- Look Maisie...

<i>Tonight in our series, 'Historic
Country Houses'</i>

25
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:26,117
<i>we are privileged to visit Ingworth,
the home of Sir Mark Loddon.</i>

26
00:03:30,632 --> 00:03:33,952
<i>You join us in one of the loveliest
Elizabethan houses in England.</i>

<i>And here tonight welcome us
Sir Mark and Lady Loddon.</i>

28
00:03:52,254 --> 00:03:56,054
<i>Now Sir Mark, if you will, we'd like you
first of all, to tell us something about</i>

29
00:03:56,065 --> 00:03:57,765
<i>the house and its history.</i>

30
00:03:58,152 --> 00:04:00,064
<i>I think your family has
always lived here, in Ingworth.</i>

31
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:02,208
<i>Yes, ever since it was built in 1580.</i>

32
00:04:02,326 --> 00:04:05,926
<i>It's a record we rather proud of. The
family built it and we still live here.</i>

33
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,777
<i>Would you like to come on the grand tour?
Very much.</i>

34
00:04:08,962 --> 00:04:10,722
Hey boys, we're missing
the big fight.

35
00:04:11,143 --> 00:04:12,733
Charlie, switch it over.

36
00:04:13,619 --> 00:04:14,799
Excuse me sir.

37
00:04:17,276 --> 00:04:19,786
- Hey, switch that back, will you?
- Leave it Charlie?

38
00:04:19,812 --> 00:04:22,865
- Look, I've got to see that program.
- Well, you ain't gonna see in here, mate.

39
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,159
That's enough sir. I don't want
any trouble here.

40
00:04:25,222 --> 00:04:27,452
- He's got him cold.
- I've got a dollar on him.

41
00:04:30,396 --> 00:04:33,186
- Do you live near here?
- Well yes, just around the corner.

42
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:34,820
- I share a flat with a girlfriend.
- Good.

43
00:04:34,844 --> 00:04:37,084
What are you getting at?
Nothing doing.

44
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,380
- No No. Have you got a television set?
- What?

45
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:40,896
Have you got a television set?

46
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,656
Here we are, it's over there.

47
00:04:50,336 --> 00:04:52,116
Doesn't this darn thing work?

48
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:55,987
- Give it a chance to warm up.
- All right, then. Come on, come on.

49
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:58,049
Oh, I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

50
00:04:58,071 --> 00:05:00,401
One TV program is same
as any other.

51
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,020
<i>It's quite a great deal these days
maintaining Ingworth.</i>

52
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,518
<i>Yes, if we didn't open the house
to the public at weekends,</i>

53
00:05:06,635 --> 00:05:10,235
<i>and certain other holidays, we shouldn't
able to afford to live here, anyway.</i>

54
00:05:10,417 --> 00:05:12,977
<i>You are the seventh baronet, aren't you?
Yes, I am.</i>

55
00:05:13,001 --> 00:05:16,081
<i>That's the first one there,
Sir John Loddon.</i>

56
00:05:18,054 --> 00:05:20,944
<i>You know it's quite remarkable
after all these years.</i>

57
00:05:21,201 --> 00:05:23,482
<i>- The family like this, I mean.
- Do you think I like him?</i>

58
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,573
<i>- Yes, you got the Loddon face.
- Can't see it myself.</i>

59
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:28,680
<i>One's a very bad judge
of one's own face.</i>

60
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:32,221
<i>Oh, yes, darling, he is just like you.
Except for the weight.</i>

61
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:35,243
- You really want to watch it?
- Shhh...

62
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,910
<i>What a splendid room.</i>

63
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,841
<i>But we hardly ever use it.
Not really since the war.</i>

64
00:05:41,988 --> 00:05:44,598
<i>Of course, you were a prisoner
of war Mark, weren't you?</i>

65
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:46,259
<i>Yes, I was taken prisoner
at Dunkirk.</i>

66
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:49,529
<i>When were you released?
I escaped just before the end of the war.</i>

67
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:51,451
<i>Just in time for the celebrations.</i>

68
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:54,782
<i>I was in no condition to celebrate,
I was in hospital for 6 months.</i>

69
00:05:54,804 --> 00:05:56,624
<i>Oh... That's lovely, isn't it?</i>

70
00:05:57,125 --> 00:06:00,625
<i>And then you were discharged from
the army and got married soon afterwards.</i>

71
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:01,657
<i>That's right, yes.</i>

72
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:05,185
<i>And your son was born in the following
year? - Yes, on Christmas day.</i>

73
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,417
<i>- Are we going to see him tonight?
- Oh, I'm afraid not.</i>

74
00:06:07,531 --> 00:06:09,951
<i>He is asleep in his nursery.
At least, I hope he is.</i>

75
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:13,972
<i>I dare say, a lot of famous people
have dined in this room. - Yes.</i>

<i>Queen Elizabeth I.</i>

<i>Charles II.</i>

<i>Margaret you're better at this
than I, you take over.</i>

79
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:23,607
<i>Naturally I'm American. And
you know what Americans</i>

80
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,035
<i>are like when they are
hotfoot after culture.</i>

81
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:29,171
<i>Well, it was Marlborough
and Disraeli.</i>

82
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,207
<i>And this will surprise you,
Benjamin Franklin. - Really?</i>

83
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:34,167
<i>- Yes.
- At all around this table?</i>

84
00:06:34,687 --> 00:06:37,437
<i>By the look of it
you are expecting them again this evening.</i>

85
00:06:38,724 --> 00:06:40,914
<i>We've laid it out especially for you.
For me?</i>

86
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,718
<i>For you and the viewers.
It set exactly as it was</i>

87
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:47,254
<i>for my husband's 21st birthday party.
Is it?</i>

88
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:50,494
<i>That would be interesting to know
who the guests were on that occasion.</i>

89
00:06:50,779 --> 00:06:52,529
<i>Could you name them for us, Sir Mark?</i>

90
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:56,544
<i>Ah, the guests...</i>

91
00:06:58,128 --> 00:07:00,958
<i>- You want to know their names.
- Yes.</i>

92
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:05,342
<i>Well...</i>

93
00:07:06,565 --> 00:07:11,125
<i>mostly just friends and relations.
Won't you name just a few for us?</i>

94
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:13,707
<i>Just one if you like?</i>

95
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:16,383
<i>- Well I...
- Don't you remember?</i>

96
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:18,632
<i>No, I don't remember.
I'm terribly sorry. I</i>

97
00:07:18,657 --> 00:07:20,835
<i>don't remember. Is
anything strange in that?</i>

98
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:24,689
Not strange at all, pal.
Not strange at all.

99
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:27,768
<i>As matter of fact my husband hates
all family ceremonies.</i>

100
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:31,024
<i>- Oh, a lot of people do.
- Well I like them. I love all tradition.</i>

101
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,537
<i>I'm fascinated by</i>

102
00:07:32,538 --> 00:07:35,898
<i>all the things my husband
has always taken for granted.</i>

103
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,913
He's taking a lot
for granted, that guy.

104
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:42,157
Well don't tell me you know him?

105
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:45,060
If it's who I think it is, I know him.

106
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:48,848
<i>I think we mustn't trespass on your time
any more. Lady Loddon we must go.</i>

107
00:07:48,973 --> 00:07:51,153
Come on, your hand.
Let's see your hand.

108
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:52,873
<i>And to you Sir Mark, being so kind.</i>

109
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,919
<i>- Good night.
- Thank you very much, indeed.</i>

110
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:58,511
<i>That was a visit to Ingworth
the home of...</i>

111
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,660
Thank Goodness that's over.

112
00:08:02,033 --> 00:08:04,653
Are you going to buy me a drink
or something? I need it.

113
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:06,188
Here. Buy yourself a bottle.

114
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:10,715
But... Aren't you coming with me? I
thought you didn't take off the two days.

115
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:13,856
I may not take off at all.

116
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,295
Oh, thank goodness that's over.

117
00:08:20,856 --> 00:08:22,416
- Good night!
- Good night!

118
00:08:27,034 --> 00:08:29,044
- How do you think it went?
- Fine.

119
00:08:29,157 --> 00:08:32,097
Except when I made a fool of
myself just now. - Oh, nonsense.

120
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,985
His fault was for asking those
stupid questions.

121
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:38,577
Oh, you can't blame him darling.
It was just bad luck.

122
00:08:38,697 --> 00:08:40,867
- How could he know?
- Know what?

123
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:44,644
That you can't always remember the things
that happened to you before the war.

124
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,573
What should I have done?

125
00:08:47,054 --> 00:08:50,224
Tell the hell country in general
that the war changed my life?

126
00:08:53,913 --> 00:08:58,073
Except for the memory.
It hasn't changed that much, has it?

127
00:08:58,522 --> 00:08:59,522
Hasn't it?

128
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,180
I don't know.

129
00:09:02,995 --> 00:09:05,535
I was only 26 and I hadn't had a gray hair
on my head.

130
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,290
And now you are an old, old man.

131
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:10,731
Settled with a possessive wife.

132
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:13,457
Now that part I rather like.

133
00:09:17,979 --> 00:09:20,469
Darling. Shall we go up?

134
00:09:21,748 --> 00:09:24,728
Ahh, no. Not just yet.

135
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:27,841
I feel a little restless.

136
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:31,715
You go up.
I'll join you presently.

137
00:09:32,564 --> 00:09:34,054
All right darling.

138
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:37,433
- Good night!
- Good night!

139
00:09:48,332 --> 00:09:50,482
I thought you did very well.

140
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:10,450
Get out! Get out! Get away!

141
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:15,574
I'm sorry.

142
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:20,082
- I'm terribly, terribly sorry.
- Oh, darling, darling.

143
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,580
I had to come down. I heard you playing
that same tune again.

144
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,080
Yes, I know you did.

145
00:11:25,877 --> 00:11:27,567
Let me help you. Tell me.

146
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,755
It came from nowhere.

147
00:11:30,048 --> 00:11:31,738
I wasn't even thinking about it.

148
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,921
It suddenly started.

149
00:11:34,188 --> 00:11:36,318
It went on and on and on,
beating in my brain.

150
00:11:36,345 --> 00:11:38,735
And always always stopping
at the same place.

151
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,517
Why does it always do that? Why?

152
00:11:41,635 --> 00:11:43,435
Yes, but this time there
was something more,

153
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,443
wasn't it?
Yes, there was something more.

154
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:48,489
Standing there I saw a reflection,

155
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,595
behind me in the looking glass.
And then the music stopped.

156
00:11:53,231 --> 00:11:56,281
And I knew then at that moment...

157
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,967
that those two things were
part of my nightmare.

158
00:12:01,126 --> 00:12:04,796
The tune and the reflection.
And for one second...

159
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,790
I knew quite clearly
what that reflection was.

160
00:12:10,681 --> 00:12:13,931
Darling, it was me.

161
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:16,976
No.

162
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,050
It wasn't you.

163
00:12:20,248 --> 00:12:23,248
- It wasn't you.
- Who then?

164
00:12:24,086 --> 00:12:25,426
I don't know.

165
00:12:27,042 --> 00:12:29,162
Something I've forgotten.

166
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,646
Oh, darling I can't help you.

167
00:12:34,547 --> 00:12:36,027
I can't help you!

168
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,145
And I want so much to.

169
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,230
I love you so.

170
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,840
Whatever happens...

171
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:47,187
or whatever I do...

172
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:52,071
you'll never leave me, will you?
Never.

173
00:12:52,889 --> 00:12:54,279
Because I need you.

174
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,470
I need you.

175
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,176
<i>Ingworth, In Norfolk, England.</i>

176
00:13:37,128 --> 00:13:39,258
Welcome to Ingworth House.

177
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:42,239
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Ingworth is hardly altered at all

178
00:13:42,245 --> 00:13:44,735
since the first day it's stood here
in the valley,

179
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:47,925
before the Spanish armada sailed.
This way ladies and gentlemen...

180
00:14:16,932 --> 00:14:20,112
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
if you all have the seen the dining room

181
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:24,362
I'd like to take you to the next item
of interest, which is the long gallery.

182
00:14:24,481 --> 00:14:29,571
But first of all, may I draw your
attention on this magnificent staircase,

183
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:32,111
which is of course part of
the original building.

184
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:35,132
Well now I'll take you upstairs
to the long gallery.

185
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:37,091
This way ladies and
gentlemen, please.

186
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:43,161
Both sides up it all goes the same way.

187
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:45,767
Robert, put that down!
Come away, both of you.

188
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,890
Thank you.

189
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,925
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Good afternoon, Pete.

190
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,460
- Had a good day?
- Yes, sir. Nearly 500.

191
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:10,011
- Very good day.
- Did they break anything?

192
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:12,775
- No, sir. Not this time.
- That's a blessing.

193
00:15:14,136 --> 00:15:17,166
<i>Baa, baa, black sheep,
Have you any wool?</i>

194
00:15:17,604 --> 00:15:20,904
<i>Yes, sir, yes, sir,
Three bags full;</i>

195
00:15:21,023 --> 00:15:22,973
<i>One for the...
- master,</i>

196
00:15:23,093 --> 00:15:25,163
<i>And one for the...
- maid,</i>

197
00:15:25,283 --> 00:15:29,483
<i>And one for.
The little boy Who lives down the lane.</i>

198
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,459
You make a very charming picture you know.
Hello, daddy.

199
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,945
- What would you call the picture?
- Oh I don't know.

200
00:15:35,355 --> 00:15:36,865
<i>Domestic bliss, I suppose.</i>

201
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:39,908
No one can fit in more perfectly
with the surroundings.

202
00:15:40,028 --> 00:15:42,288
Thank you, sir.
I'm glad you think so.

203
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:46,190
Come Michael now. You go off to the
kitchen, take those to Mrs. Bead.

204
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,967
- Take Jason with you, darling.
- Yes, take Jason with you.

205
00:15:48,979 --> 00:15:50,309
Come on, Jason.

206
00:15:52,272 --> 00:15:54,122
Just think if we'd never met,
you and I.

207
00:15:56,184 --> 00:15:58,804
There'd be just you and just me
miles and miles apart.

208
00:15:58,922 --> 00:16:00,262
A dreadful thought.

209
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:03,509
- What would you be doing?
- Oh, working.

210
00:16:03,632 --> 00:16:07,102
- New York. In some office, I suppose.
- And you?

211
00:16:07,994 --> 00:16:09,644
I wouldn't be alive.

212
00:16:11,577 --> 00:16:12,787
Margaret...

213
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,681
I... have a feeling.

214
00:16:19,908 --> 00:16:21,928
That I won't have that
nightmare again.

215
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:25,915
When I...

216
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:29,730
when I shouted at you last night,

217
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:34,635
- You won't laugh at this, will you?
- Oh, darling I'm not laughing at you.

218
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:39,079
I felt... I felt as if a devil had gone
out of me.

219
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
I think for good.

220
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:44,970
Really?

221
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,980
Yes, really.

222
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,070
I'm not even

223
00:16:53,065 --> 00:16:55,685
I'm not even frightened
of that tune anymore.

224
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,459
What are you doing in here?

225
00:17:41,229 --> 00:17:43,349
These are the private apartments,
you know.

226
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,320
Did you lose your way?

227
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,340
I'll show you out, right?

228
00:17:52,884 --> 00:17:54,454
I know you.

229
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,950
You're...

230
00:17:59,142 --> 00:18:00,142
Jeff...

231
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,090
- Jeffrey...
- Buckenham.

232
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:05,050
Of course.

233
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,830
Alpine Camp 1945. The same hut.

234
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:11,823
Of course I remember you.
Jeffrey Buckenham from Montreal.

235
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,970
Where had you been all
these years?

236
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:17,060
Places.
Well, why didn't you contact me sooner?

237
00:18:18,465 --> 00:18:21,355
Now that you're here, don't think
you're going away so easily.

238
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,990
You'll stay for dinner, won't you?

239
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:25,695
Maggie will be delighted to see you.
You remember Margaret, don't you?

240
00:18:25,719 --> 00:18:26,989
I told you all about her.

241
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,720
Oh, we finally did get married.
Here at Ingworth church.

242
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,657
Jeff,
it's really good to see you again.

243
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,180
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

244
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,940
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

245
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,690
Hello Frank!

246
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,120
What did you say?

247
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,370
Your name. Just your name,
Frank Welney.

248
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,550
I'm the one with the bad memory.

249
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,070
My name is Mark.

250
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,840
Don't you remember? I remember.

251
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:07,870
That's the trouble.

252
00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:11,030
I remember that hand.

253
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,020
I remember your theme song.

254
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,650
What are you talking about?

255
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,540
You, the English baronet.

256
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,870
Yeah, you played the part pretty well,
Frank, but I'm afraid the show is over.

257
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,610
What is this? What do you want?

258
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,910
You forget I was there.

259
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,180
I know what happened to Mark.

260
00:19:53,653 --> 00:19:56,193
And I'm going to make you
pay for this.

261
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,060
If it's the last think I do
I'm gonna make you pay for this.

262
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:02,030
Pay for what?

263
00:20:04,173 --> 00:20:05,523
Oh, I see what it is.

264
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,290
Money, that's it.

265
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,870
A case of a little blackmail.

266
00:20:11,132 --> 00:20:12,872
Oh, no. You got me wrong Frank.

267
00:20:14,491 --> 00:20:16,671
I'll name the price alright
and you'll pay it.

268
00:20:16,696 --> 00:20:18,366
But it won't be
just a few pounds.

269
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:22,210
I want a lot more than that and
I'm going to get it.

270
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,300
I want to see you crawl, Frank.

271
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,770
I want the whole world to see
what a louse you are.

272
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:33,600
Get out! Get out!
You damn fraud.

273
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:35,159
Get out!

274
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm not gonna touch you.

275
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,580
What I'm gonna do is gonna
hurt a lot more.

276
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm...

277
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm sorry, I can't stay
for dinner, Frank.

278
00:21:06,915 --> 00:21:08,475
Who was that?

279
00:21:09,514 --> 00:21:11,904
A war time companion.

280
00:21:14,134 --> 00:21:19,264
- Why did he call you, Frank?
- He mistook me for someone else.

281
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,250
Someone we both knew
a long time ago.

282
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,554
- Good afternoon, sir!
- Good afternoon!

283
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:50,497
Can I speak to
Captain Gerald Loddon, please?

284
00:21:50,563 --> 00:21:53,453
- Certainly, I just get him.
- Thank you.

285
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,110
Nice, isn't it?

286
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,130
- Captain Loddon?
- Yes.

287
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,160
You're,
Sir Mark Loddon's cousin.

288
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,160
- Yes. Why? Do you know him?
- I met him during the war.

289
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:19,407
Ah, splendid.

290
00:22:19,666 --> 00:22:22,226
How do you like the new cars?
They're pretty hot stuff.

291
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,749
I'm not really suppose
to talk about speed,

292
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,686
most of our customers are a bit slow.
Look, I'm here on a personal matter.

293
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,710
Oh.

294
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:32,610
If Mark Loddon hadn't come back
from the war...

295
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,072
you would have
inherited everything.

296
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,720
What are you getting at?

297
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,830
Only this.

298
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:47,146
Mark Loddon didn't come back
from the war.

299
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,949
<i>Frank...</i>

300
00:22:56,205 --> 00:22:57,715
<i>I remember.</i>

301
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,350
<i>That's the trouble, Frank.</i>

302
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:04,764
<i>I remember.</i>

303
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,090
Maggie...

304
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,720
What is it?

305
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:29,781
I don't know.

306
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,550
So you see from what I said,
he can't be your cousin.

307
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:38,419
I don't know if what you say is true.

308
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:41,234
It is true. I was there.

309
00:23:41,964 --> 00:23:44,754
I don't deny he has changed
a bit since the war.

310
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:46,940
Almost a different man.

311
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,770
But you know I hardly feel
I can do anything about it.

312
00:23:51,066 --> 00:23:53,956
Well if you won't do anything I will.
I will go to the police.

313
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,970
But I doubt if they would listen to you.

314
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,020
Somebody is going to listen to me.

315
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,960
I want to get this thing
out to the open.

316
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:10,530
You know you could always...

317
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,950
Always what?

318
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,770
No, if I were you I would forget all
about it. - What were you gonna say?

319
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:19,330
Well I was only going to say

320
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,033
you could always go right
to the press.

321
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,020
You know an open letter
publicly exposing him.

322
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,060
Some papers would jump at it.

323
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,350
- What papers?
- Well, the...

324
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:33,154
Sunday Gazette for one.
It's right up their street.

325
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,580
You know fearless exposure,
Sunday Gazette speaks out for justice.

326
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:39,799
They love that sort of thing.

327
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,449
As it happens they don't love
my cousin, Mark.

328
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Thank you.

329
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:54,410
Now look old chap. I didn't mean
that I shouldn't have spoken.

330
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:58,770
You may get into trouble.
Besides I'm very fond of my cousin.

331
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:01,657
He is not your cousin.

332
00:25:02,203 --> 00:25:03,763
And I want trouble.

333
00:25:06,052 --> 00:25:08,582
- Mommy?
- What is it, darling?

334
00:25:08,704 --> 00:25:10,524
Mommy, mommy, come here!

335
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:13,181
Michael, what's the matter?

336
00:25:13,449 --> 00:25:17,409
- Who are you? What are you doing here?
- Sorry, we're just taking a few pictures.

337
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:20,088
- Did you get Sir Mark's permission?
- We sent our message out...

338
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,255
- But did he give you his permission?
- No, he didn't.

339
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,220
Stop it! Michael go on up
to the nursery.

340
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,959
How dare you come bursting
in here like this.

341
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,914
Take it easy. We got a job to do
and a living to make same as anybody else.

342
00:25:31,938 --> 00:25:33,398
- You're news?
- News?

343
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,830
You should know.

344
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,690
- You are Lady Loddon aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

345
00:25:37,762 --> 00:25:40,332
Well then, what do you expect?
After that letter in the Gazette.

346
00:25:40,445 --> 00:25:43,465
- Letter? What letter?
- Haven't you read it?

347
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,490
Must be the only one. Here.

348
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,080
BOGUS BARONET

349
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,320
Fraud and impostor.

350
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,990
Not very nice, is it?

351
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,380
You got your pictures.

352
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,400
Now, will you please go?
Come on, Harry.

353
00:26:04,091 --> 00:26:05,281
Darling.

354
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,550
Maggie...

355
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:10,840
Who were they at the church?
Mark, I think you gotta see this.

356
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,510
Oh, yes. I have seen it.

357
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:16,880
Pete showed it to me.
But who could write such stuff.

358
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,790
Was it that man
who was here the other day?

359
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:25,490
- The man who called you Frank?
- Yes, yes, it was.

360
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:29,810
I have told you
he'd made a mistake then.

361
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,150
He's got mad and paper's mad
for printing it.

362
00:26:32,253 --> 00:26:34,723
- What are you going to do?
- Do?

363
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:36,560
I'm going to ignore it.

364
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:40,317
What does one do with muck like that?
We shall be late darling.

365
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,000
I don't think I want to go.

366
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,090
Margaret, you must go.

367
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,720
We've got to go.

368
00:27:04,892 --> 00:27:07,802
My dear, isn't it awful?
About Mark Loddon I mean.

369
00:27:07,924 --> 00:27:10,924
If you mean that rubbish
in the paper Mildred...

370
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,400
Excuse me, does sir Mark Loddon
always come here to church?

371
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,920
Well, nearly always,
but I don't expect he will today.

372
00:27:18,184 --> 00:27:21,444
- Why on earth not Mildred?
- Well, under the circumstances

373
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,310
you hardly expect him to show
his face in public.

374
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:27,089
Unless of course, she made him.

375
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,180
She is an American and you know
how Americans adore publicity.

376
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,939
I mean if he doesn't, well.
One knows what to think.

377
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,820
- Doesn't it?
- Exactly.

378
00:27:43,938 --> 00:27:46,938
Dear Lady Loddon. I am so sorry.

379
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,530
Of course, I don't believe a word...

380
00:27:50,986 --> 00:27:52,996
My dear, my dear.

381
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:56,310
Don't let this ridiculous rubbish
worry you too much.

382
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,080
Nobody there seems to believe it.

383
00:28:00,734 --> 00:28:02,944
Would you care to make a statement,
Sir Mark?

384
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,460
Can't you see I'm busy.

385
00:28:09,315 --> 00:28:11,585
I told you I don't want to
talk about it anymore.

386
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:14,500
- I really don't understand.
- There is nothing to understand.

387
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,340
The Gazette is being a little
more vulgar than usual. That's all.

388
00:28:17,457 --> 00:28:20,206
You're not going to do anything about it?
What do you want me to do?

389
00:28:20,230 --> 00:28:22,700
Go to court and expose
my whole life in public?

390
00:28:22,817 --> 00:28:26,207
Your life? It's my life, too.
And Michael's.

391
00:28:26,327 --> 00:28:29,217
All right. Supposing I do sue for libel.

392
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,182
Do you know what it means?
It means going to the witness box.

393
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,480
Having the last shreds of privacy
ripped from us.

394
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,565
Being plastered over in every newspaper
in the land. Do you think I want that?

395
00:28:37,589 --> 00:28:40,119
Mark, there's nothing you haven't
told me, is there?

396
00:28:40,242 --> 00:28:42,156
I've told you there's nothing.
Isn't that enough?

397
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,521
Or do you think I'm an impostor too?
I haven't thought of that one.

398
00:28:44,545 --> 00:28:46,151
Oh, Mark.
But at least that's something.

399
00:28:46,175 --> 00:28:48,825
But you still want me to go and prove
who I am. What for?

400
00:28:49,163 --> 00:28:52,483
For some tiresome neighbours, some boring
acquaintances. Why? What for?

401
00:28:52,505 --> 00:28:54,705
For Michael.
I don't care for myself.

402
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:57,496
But you don't want a cloud over him.
Perhaps for the rest of his life.

403
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,270
You must Mark
for his sake, you must.

404
00:28:59,389 --> 00:29:01,959
No, I won't.
Please, Mark, please.

405
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,930
I know our life together.

406
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,310
Our whole future depends on it.

407
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,490
I didn't think he dare.

408
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,660
Just listen to this.
A lot of people let's go into the office.

409
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:40,777
A summons from the
High Court of Justice.

410
00:29:41,272 --> 00:29:44,312
<i>Sir Mark Loddon against the
Sunday Gazette and Jeffrey Buckenham.</i>

411
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,320
<i>Plaintiff claims damages for libel.</i>

412
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:49,805
Oh, the fat is in the fire, isn't it?
It sure is he's in for it now.

413
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:52,700
- You seem very confident.
- I am.

414
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,420
I hope so for your sake.

415
00:29:54,892 --> 00:29:57,972
By the way, I've been looking through
my correspondence with Mark.

416
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:59,467
I've got something to show you.

417
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,710
There's a rather curious sentence
on this page, I think might interest you.

418
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,730
Well, this proves what I've said.

419
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,670
That's for the court
to decide, isn't it?

420
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:17,875
Now you hang onto it,
it might be of use to you.

421
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:21,689
But please don't disclose who gave it to
you because if you do, I should deny it.

422
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,320
All right. Will you be in court?

423
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,180
Well if I am it will be give
evidence for my cousin.

424
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:31,640
Well, I have to, you know. Blood is
thicker than water and all that stuff...

425
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,750
But don't worry, I don't
think you will find

426
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,870
anything I have to say
or do will be helpful.

427
00:30:36,353 --> 00:30:37,353
I see.

428
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,610
You really must excuse me,
I got some customers to attend to.

429
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,710
Good bye. See you in court.

430
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,740
It's time to go darling.
I shan't be a moment.

431
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:53,710
How long do you think
the case will last?

432
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,980
About 2-3 days, I should think.

433
00:31:00,948 --> 00:31:03,068
- Maggie...
- Yes?

434
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,500
- If anything should happen...
- What could happen?

435
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,100
I don't know.

436
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:17,710
But things may not turn out
just as we hope.

437
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,870
Darling,

438
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,640
you're quite sure there is nothing
you haven't told me?

439
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,780
Because if there is anything...

440
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:27,514
you must tell me now.

441
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,570
No, no.

442
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,130
I've told you all I know.

443
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,470
Then things can only go one way.

444
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:37,405
You've got the truth on your side
and that's all it matters.

445
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,510
You'll have to be very brave, you know.

446
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,970
This is going to be...

447
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,540
going to be quite annoying.

448
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,910
I'm ready for it.

449
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,430
Shall we go?

450
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,480
LIBEL CASE SENSATION

451
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,490
Loddon against the Sunday Gazette
and another.

452
00:32:40,856 --> 00:32:43,916
My Lord, I call Sir Mark Loddon.

453
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:59,330
Repeat after me:
I swear by Almighty God,

454
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,860
<i>I swear by Almighty God...</i>

455
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:06,390
<i>- that the evidence I shall give,
- that the evidence I shall give,</i>

456
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,772
<i>- shall be the truth,
- shall be the truth,</i>

457
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:11,163
<i>- the whole truth.
- The whole truth</i>

458
00:33:11,284 --> 00:33:14,174
<i>- and nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.</i>

459
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,780
You are Sir Mark Loddon?

460
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:25,010
The seventh Baronet of Ingworth House,
in the County of Dorset.

461
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,600
That's so.

462
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,080
And I believe Sir Mark that you joined
up at the outbreak of war,

463
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:32,559
and went to France with your unit,

464
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,050
- in 1939.
- Yes, I did.

465
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:39,250
Were you wounded and taken
prisoner at Dunkirk? - I was.

466
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:42,640
And did you subsequently escape from the
prison camp Hobhigh

467
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:45,881
known as Altflag 9A
in April 1945?

468
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,490
- I did.
- What effect that have on you?

469
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:51,730
My hair went grey.

470
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,130
- As it is now.
- And your health?

471
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,300
- Apart from my memory I don't complain.
- What of your memory?

472
00:34:02,078 --> 00:34:03,688
It's unreliable.

473
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,850
It's unreliable about events which occurred

474
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,850
before my escape.

475
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,270
I mean it's...

476
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,700
it has great gaps in it.

477
00:34:15,558 --> 00:34:17,348
There is some things that I...

478
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,460
remember quite clearly.

479
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:22,700
Things which keep coming up
to the surface like...

480
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,397
like wreckage.

481
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,830
But there are quite odd things,
quite distrunted

482
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,900
very trivial things.

483
00:34:31,019 --> 00:34:34,549
Nothing is too trivial if it helps us
to arrive at the truth.

484
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,820
What are these trivial matters
to which you refer?

485
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:41,960
Well, I remember...

486
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,300
I remember that I had a linnet,
in a cage.

487
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,350
It was given to my own 5th birthday
by the head gardener.

488
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,250
I remember his name, too.
It was Mr. Sal.

489
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:58,600
Do you remember old Sal, John?

490
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,800
The... the cage was...

491
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:06,100
it was too small.
The bird kept fluttering.

492
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,140
Really quite trivial things.

493
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,280
Other more important events

494
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,680
and people I don't remember at all.

495
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,830
Have any members of your family have
ever found difficulty identifying you?

496
00:35:19,915 --> 00:35:20,915
No.

497
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:25,515
And these of course are the people
who know you most intimately.

498
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:28,060
And now the Sunday Gazette,

499
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,880
which proudly claims
the readership of...

500
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:33,710
of... Give it to me!

501
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:41,250
Of 1200036 registered readers.

502
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,950
- Are you one of them?
- No.

503
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,950
I don't subscribe to the gutterpress.

504
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,260
Have you ever in public
voiced your distaste

505
00:35:49,270 --> 00:35:51,290
of the sensational
type of journalism

506
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,403
practiced by the Sunday Gazette?

507
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,640
Yes, once I made a speech locally.

508
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,490
In which I expressed my opinions
in no uncertain terms.

509
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:02,450
And would it be true to
say the Sunday Gazette

510
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,210
has lost no opportunity
to try and discredit you?

511
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:09,010
Yes, I am told so.

512
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:11,700
I choose to ignore it.

513
00:36:11,823 --> 00:36:14,912
And that these petty acts
of spitefulness have culminated

514
00:36:14,913 --> 00:36:16,840
in the publication
of a gross libel

515
00:36:16,851 --> 00:36:20,511
which you do not choose to ignore.
No, I do not.

516
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,930
Thank you, Sir Mark.
I think that's all.

517
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:32,640
I suggest that ever since April 1945

518
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:37,650
you've indulged in the unscrupulous
pretense of being an English baronet.

519
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,380
That's a stupid lie.

520
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,040
And most unscrupulous pretense of all

521
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,280
of being entitled to woo
and marry your wife.

522
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:50,370
You won't make me lose my temper
as easily as that, Mr. Foxley.

523
00:36:50,393 --> 00:36:52,873
We shall see. Now then.

524
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:56,040
When did you last see Frank Welney?

525
00:36:56,294 --> 00:36:57,894
Whom did you say, Mr. Foxley?

526
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:00,930
Frank Welney, My Lord.

527
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,600
You at least have heard of Frank Welney?
Yes.

528
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:10,260
- I was with him in a German prison camp.
- When did you last see him?

529
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,520
Let me help you.

530
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,770
Did you shave yourself this morning?

531
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,730
Yes, why?

532
00:37:20,090 --> 00:37:21,400
Didn't you see him then?

533
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:25,452
Really My Lord, is it necessary from
my friend to be so deliberately offensive?

534
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,800
I think you must Let him pursue
his own mind, Mr. Wilfred.

535
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,640
- Have he any peculiarities?
- No, he was a very ordinary man.

536
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:36,980
Wasn't he remarkably like you?

537
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,700
- I never noticed it.
- I see, you never noticed, no...

538
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,350
Well now then I wonder if you know

539
00:37:43,466 --> 00:37:46,676
whether Sir Mark ever wrote to anybody
about this similarity?

540
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:50,340
Did I? No, certainly not.

541
00:37:52,656 --> 00:37:55,196
Do you recognize the handwriting
on this letter?

542
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,850
- Yes, I do.
- It's yours.

543
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,110
- Of course, it is my signature, right?
- It's signed, Mark Loddon.

544
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,860
It's a page of a letter written by
Sir Mark Loddon

545
00:38:10,983 --> 00:38:15,373
from the prison camp in Germany
and contains pertinent information.

546
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,820
Would you please read it
to the jury?

547
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,000
<i>There are only two other
British prisoners in our hut here.</i>

548
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:25,290
<i>A chap called Buckenham
from Canada, and a</i>

549
00:38:25,299 --> 00:38:27,829
<i>man called Welney, from
heaven knows where.</i>

550
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:32,350
Proceed please.
Welney himself says we might be brothers.

551
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:36,140
<i>He says it makes him feel like
one of the family.</i>

552
00:38:36,923 --> 00:38:38,963
"Feel like one of the family."

553
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,690
Doesn't that letter recall
anything to you?

554
00:38:43,478 --> 00:38:44,928
"One of the family."

555
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,950
Yes.

556
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,563
Yes, it does.

557
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,440
It was a day that Buckenham
was giving out the mail.

558
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,340
Here chap.

559
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:02,868
Sorry, not you.

560
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:10,073
Ed.

561
00:39:13,237 --> 00:39:14,717
George.

562
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:33,230
- Letter for you André.
- Merci!

563
00:39:34,353 --> 00:39:35,893
Letter for you, Mark?

564
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,960
Hey, that's not yours.
All right, all right,

565
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,769
you boring Canadian lumberjack.
Just remember you gave it to me.

566
00:39:49,886 --> 00:39:51,696
You know it damn well
because I thought...

567
00:39:51,711 --> 00:39:53,541
Thought I was Mark, didn't you?

568
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:56,160
Ah, there you are. I'm
frightfully sorry old

569
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:58,777
chap, our lumberjack
friend made a mistake.

570
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,780
He thought that I was you.

571
00:40:01,018 --> 00:40:03,148
I opened it without even reading it.

572
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,719
You were reading it as quick as
you darn well could.

573
00:40:05,835 --> 00:40:08,915
That's just exactly a kind of remark
I would've expected from you.

574
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,000
Shut up, you two!

575
00:40:11,428 --> 00:40:13,378
I'll hit him if I stay here.

576
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,910
He really is impossible, that chap.

577
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,510
So uncouth.

578
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:32,602
I just wish we could have have him
transferred to another hut.

579
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,480
Jeff's a very good friend of mine.

580
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:37,420
If it wasn't for him, I would have been
off my head years ago.

581
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,090
You don't think I was deliberately
reading your letter, do you?

582
00:40:43,197 --> 00:40:44,557
No, of course not.

583
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,570
I'm glad of that Mark.

584
00:40:47,285 --> 00:40:50,785
You don't mind me calling you Mark, do
you? It's rather presumptuous of me.

585
00:40:50,817 --> 00:40:53,137
It's a bit silly after 3 years,
wouldn't it?

586
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,180
Yes.

587
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,040
You see it's so frightfully good
to talk to you Mark.

588
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:01,301
You understand people.

589
00:41:01,965 --> 00:41:04,935
I'm quite sure that lumberjack
just said that I was...

590
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,170
a little snob sucking up to you.

591
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:08,633
Oh, don't be silly.

592
00:41:08,749 --> 00:41:11,039
I realize perfectly well
compared to you,

593
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:13,187
I'm absolute nothing,
I am just a...

594
00:41:13,310 --> 00:41:16,250
provincial actor, small parts.

595
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:19,040
No background, no standing.

596
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,730
But what's a chap to do?

597
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:26,650
One can't get on in the theater these days
unless one is in with the right people.

598
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:30,662
Talent is I am afraid is really,
not all together enough.

599
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,450
And I am quite talented.

600
00:41:34,094 --> 00:41:36,614
Well, perhaps you'll have better luck
when we get out.

601
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,710
I certainly mean to get on.

602
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:41,670
I assure you that.

603
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,500
Mark, I am sorry about the letter.

604
00:41:53,536 --> 00:41:55,516
It was from your fiancee,
wasn't it?

605
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:58,650
I saw her name on the envelope.

606
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,850
Or does one say, envelope
in your accent.

607
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,600
I don't think it matters why?

608
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,220
One doesn't want to make mistakes.

609
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:11,730
Would you give her my regards
when you write?

610
00:42:12,211 --> 00:42:15,521
You and I being so like each other
at least people say we are.

611
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:18,040
Almost makes me feel like
one of the family.

612
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:23,102
It just goes to show, doesn't it
how easily some people can be mistaken.

613
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:26,122
Can they?
I am lucky enough to...

614
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,010
have here an official description
of Welney from the army records,

615
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:32,750
"Thick, crop of grey hair."

616
00:42:33,141 --> 00:42:34,601
How would you describe yours?

617
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:38,130
Mr. Foxley, what is
the date of that document?

618
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,230
The year 1939.

619
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:43,730
Supposing a man's hair had not
been grey then

620
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,020
surely it could have turned grey
after all these year.

621
00:42:47,142 --> 00:42:48,522
I am aware of that, My Lord.

622
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:51,729
Indeed it hadn't largely disappeared.

623
00:42:51,993 --> 00:42:54,713
It has for so many of us.

624
00:42:57,832 --> 00:43:01,702
But it is also on record that
Frank Welney

625
00:43:01,821 --> 00:43:05,281
has lost the first two joints of the
first finger of his right hand.

626
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:09,870
Have you? - Would you please hold
up your right hand to the jury?

627
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,510
May I ask how you lost your finger?

628
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:25,360
- It was shot off during the escape.
- How very convenient.

629
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:29,500
So that would produce the interesting
result that no one in the prison camp

630
00:43:29,614 --> 00:43:32,434
could remember that Sir Mark Loddon
had lost his finger.

631
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,440
Naturally.

632
00:43:34,561 --> 00:43:36,251
- But I do.
- Thank you.

633
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,510
And so today by another
remarkable coincidence

634
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,460
your body combines all the physical
peculiarities of both Welney and Loddon.

635
00:43:47,517 --> 00:43:48,997
So it would appear.

636
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:51,609
When did you say you last saw Welney?

637
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:56,130
I repeat the question.

638
00:43:56,391 --> 00:43:59,011
When did you last see Frank Welney?

639
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:03,930
It was during the escape.

640
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:07,520
Was anyone else a party
to the escape?

641
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:09,013
Yes.

642
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:11,220
Buckenham.

643
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,080
Would you please tell us
exactly what happened?

644
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:18,880
Well, we...

645
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:21,740
we started away from...

646
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,940
from the camp...

647
00:44:25,295 --> 00:44:27,825
We were making our way
to the Dutch border.

648
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,970
Hiding by day and walking by night.

649
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,120
We had very little food,

650
00:44:35,693 --> 00:44:37,183
and not much sleep.

651
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,060
One night we...

652
00:44:42,070 --> 00:44:43,500
we came to the outskirts

653
00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:45,460
of a town.

654
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,129
All right, they have gone.

655
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,020
I could eat a horse.

656
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:33,580
Better go and find one.

657
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:40,270
We'd not eaten for 3 days.

658
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:43,500
And Buckenham...

659
00:46:44,992 --> 00:46:46,542
Yes, Buckenham?

660
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:48,960
Well there was...

661
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:50,790
there was a...

662
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,480
a kind of farm across the field.

663
00:46:54,426 --> 00:46:56,766
So we decided
amongst ourselves that...

664
00:46:57,827 --> 00:47:00,227
one of us ought to go
and find something.

665
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:01,930
And I wanted to...

666
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:07,070
but you said no, because I was
the only one in British uniform

667
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:09,540
and anyway you were
the youngest.

668
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,730
You?

669
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,210
Do you mean Mr. Buckenham?

670
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:17,646
Oh, I'm sorry. Yes.

671
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:23,280
Then he left us.

672
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,670
And eh...

673
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,180
And then?

674
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:29,700
Welney and I...

675
00:47:30,730 --> 00:47:32,300
were left to wait for him.

676
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,060
You were alone together.

677
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:36,874
Yes.

678
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,850
We were alone together.

679
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:41,560
And then?

680
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,510
And then...

681
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:48,290
Yes? And then?

682
00:47:49,530 --> 00:47:50,920
There was a mist.

683
00:47:53,646 --> 00:47:55,106
And water moving.

684
00:47:56,118 --> 00:47:58,418
Pulling and waving.

685
00:48:01,066 --> 00:48:03,716
And Buckenham crawling away.

686
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:09,583
Something... in the water.

687
00:48:12,253 --> 00:48:15,723
- And Welney.
- And Welney?

688
00:48:16,782 --> 00:48:18,962
What about Welney?

689
00:48:20,511 --> 00:48:22,701
What about Welney?

690
00:48:24,890 --> 00:48:26,060
Witness!

691
00:48:27,051 --> 00:48:28,821
What happened to Welney?

692
00:48:33,017 --> 00:48:35,127
I can't remember.

693
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,150
So you can't remember.
How very interesting.

694
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,670
I can't remember!

695
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:48,040
I've told you. I can't remember
anything after that.

696
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,367
It's not because I don't want remember
because I can't.

697
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,740
I remember a mist.

698
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,260
I remember water.

699
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,250
And Buckenham, crawling away.

700
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,730
That is all!

701
00:49:07,557 --> 00:49:09,027
Silence!

702
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,260
You made a great deal of this
loss of memory.

703
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:14,023
Even if it isn't so complete.

704
00:49:14,138 --> 00:49:17,558
How is it possible for you to remember
your pre-war engagement,

705
00:49:17,675 --> 00:49:20,295
and the lady's name on your return?

706
00:49:22,346 --> 00:49:24,456
Do you refuse to answer that question?

707
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:27,750
Well.

708
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,550
I did forget her.

709
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:33,233
I forgot her name, her face,
her very existence.

710
00:49:34,696 --> 00:49:36,816
But she wrote to me
while I was in hospital

711
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:38,965
and her letters revived
my memory of her.

712
00:49:39,094 --> 00:49:42,334
Could you produce any letters written
by Sir Mark Loddon

713
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:44,907
which refer to his wound

714
00:49:45,030 --> 00:49:46,910
- and his loss of memory?
- No.

715
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,380
No, I can't produce any letters
like that.

716
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,800
I never wrote about those things.

717
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,800
Rightly or wrongly, I...

718
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:57,901
I kept them from her.

719
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:01,380
You seem to have kept a great deal
from her.

720
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:04,720
If I am Welney,
what became of Loddon?

721
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:06,773
That's a very interesting question

722
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,350
which I don't propose to answer now.
Thank you.

723
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,100
That will be all.

724
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:19,270
Mr. Foxley I think this might be an
appropriate moment for an enjoyable lunch.

725
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:31,180
Lady Loddon. Excuse me,
a fellow countryman of yours

726
00:50:31,299 --> 00:50:33,439
Barry Medox,
American Press Service.

727
00:50:33,558 --> 00:50:35,141
I'm sure people in America would be
interested knowing how...

728
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:37,578
Lady Loddon has nothing to say.
Will you leave us alone please?

729
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:39,152
Excuse me.

730
00:50:40,269 --> 00:50:44,019
Hello Hubert, what's good today?
The trout's excellent.

731
00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:48,670
My learned friend highly recommends
the trout.

732
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:51,445
Which is a very good reason for
having the turnout. - Now now.

733
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:54,250
You mustn't be too put off by Fox's
professional manner.

734
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:57,905
We fight like angry stags in court
but outside we are the best of friends.

735
00:50:57,938 --> 00:51:00,548
Now then this afternoon
should be quite straightforward.

736
00:51:00,569 --> 00:51:03,409
I'm going to call your relatives
as to discuss and after that

737
00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:06,770
I should like to put Lady Loddon
in the box, just to clinch things.

738
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:08,902
You'll do no such thing.
Why not my dear fellow?

739
00:51:09,018 --> 00:51:11,438
Just a few simple,
straightforward questions.

740
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:13,360
Lady Loddon is our principal asset.

741
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,530
She'll ensure the jury's sympathy.

742
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:18,279
You speak as if there was some doubt
about the result of this case.

743
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,130
Darling if he thinks it will help...

744
00:51:20,254 --> 00:51:22,978
No it's quite out of question.
I won't have you humiliated in that box.

745
00:51:23,002 --> 00:51:25,102
The whole thing's sordid
without dragging you

746
00:51:25,112 --> 00:51:27,222
into it. That's the end
to the whole matter.

747
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,340
Captain Loddon, when you were
questioned by my learned friend,

748
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,405
you said, you
recognized your cousin

749
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:35,512
anywhere.
Of course, Known him all my life.

750
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,420
I often went to Ingworth on
holiday when we were kids.

751
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:40,500
But I use to bully him a lot then.

752
00:51:40,619 --> 00:51:44,179
I remember on one occasion we were larking
around and he felt down from a tree.

753
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,040
He still has a scar to thank me for.

754
00:51:46,156 --> 00:51:47,956
- Then another time...
- Just a moment.

755
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:52,290
This scar you mentioned. Where is it?
On the left leg, just about the knee.

756
00:51:52,408 --> 00:51:54,318
- You're sure?
- Oh quite positive.

757
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,940
Yes, thank you.
I have here Captain Loddon

758
00:51:56,941 --> 00:51:59,381
report of a full medical
examination to which the

759
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,860
plaintiff was good enough to
submit to at our request.

760
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:04,908
It contains no reference to any scar.

761
00:52:06,134 --> 00:52:07,984
I don't quite understand that.

762
00:52:08,426 --> 00:52:11,886
As I remember it was a pretty serious cut
that had several stitches in it.

763
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,570
I'd say that scar would still be there.

764
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:16,715
I'm quite prepared to believe that
Sir Mark Loddon had a scar

765
00:52:16,841 --> 00:52:18,751
but the plaintiff obviously hasn't.

766
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:22,450
- Look I hope you don't think...
- Thank you Captain Loddon.

767
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,260
I should like to re-examine
this witness, my Lord.

768
00:52:27,590 --> 00:52:28,960
By all means.

769
00:52:29,190 --> 00:52:31,210
Apart from the question of the scar

770
00:52:31,332 --> 00:52:34,422
about which there appears to be
some conflict of opinion,

771
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,230
you are absolutely certain are
you not that the plaintiff

772
00:52:38,353 --> 00:52:41,413
in fact Sir Mark Loddon.
Yes, of course, except...

773
00:52:41,526 --> 00:52:42,626
Except?

774
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:45,960
- Nothing, I'm absolutely certain.
- Exactly.

775
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,550
Thank you Captain Loddon.

776
00:52:49,609 --> 00:52:53,289
I consider it absolutely essential that
we should call Lady Loddon...

777
00:52:53,406 --> 00:52:56,106
- On no account.
- She knows you better than anybody.

778
00:52:56,385 --> 00:52:59,035
The evidence about the scar
could be very damaging to us.

779
00:52:59,064 --> 00:53:01,764
- I said no.
- Lady Loddon I appeal to you...

780
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:06,024
Not if Mark doesn't want me to do.

781
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:10,170
- Sir Wilfred when you are ready?
- I beg your Lordship's pardon.

782
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,900
I have no further witnesses to call.

783
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,110
In that case we will
adjourn until tomorrow.

784
00:53:24,175 --> 00:53:25,495
Excuse me.

785
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,270
LIBEL CASE LATEST

786
00:53:41,285 --> 00:53:43,355
Back a winner mister?
Looks like it.

787
00:53:49,650 --> 00:53:52,120
- Are you awake?
- Yes.

788
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,000
I can't sleep either.

789
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:01,900
But you must.
I'll get you something.

790
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:05,780
You'll need all your strength
for tomorrow.

791
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:10,890
Mark.

792
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:14,263
Why did you never tell me that

793
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:17,602
there was a time when you've
forgotten me all together?

794
00:54:19,470 --> 00:54:21,390
I thought it might be...

795
00:54:22,421 --> 00:54:24,631
might be the one thing
you couldn't forgive.

796
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,310
And that you wouldn't marry me.

797
00:54:31,986 --> 00:54:34,196
I didn't know you then
as I know you now.

798
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:40,550
Take it. It'll make you sleep.

799
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,470
Why didn't you tell me afterwards?

800
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:51,310
After it didn't seem to matter.

801
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:52,570
And anyway...

802
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,360
I thought it might hurt you.

803
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,130
Hurt me much more
hearing it like that today.

804
00:55:01,182 --> 00:55:03,942
Do you think it didn't hurt me
to have to say it like that?

805
00:55:04,064 --> 00:55:07,234
Oh darling, that was a horribly
selfish thing for me to say.

806
00:55:07,490 --> 00:55:08,770
Forgive me.

807
00:55:10,285 --> 00:55:12,775
It isn't very often that
I have to do that, is it?

808
00:55:36,236 --> 00:55:38,026
- Good night.
- Good night.

809
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:07,725
- Maggie.
- Yes?

810
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:10,336
It happened again today.

811
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:14,260
- In court.
- I guessed.

812
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:18,020
I was remembering the water...

813
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:21,380
and something moving in it.

814
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,210
When the music stopped.

815
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:29,930
Of course.

816
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:32,660
It was a reflection.

817
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:37,560
It was the same reflection
I saw on the looking glass that night.

818
00:56:38,954 --> 00:56:40,819
What is it?

819
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:43,320
What is it? What is it?

820
00:56:43,579 --> 00:56:45,549
It was only yourself.

821
00:56:45,673 --> 00:56:49,093
If it was myself why does it frighten
me so much. Why? Why?

822
00:56:53,211 --> 00:56:54,591
Unless...

823
00:56:59,306 --> 00:57:01,426
Supposing it were true.

824
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,840
Supposing what were true?

825
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,750
That I was not myself.

826
00:57:10,941 --> 00:57:12,891
That that other man...

827
00:57:16,696 --> 00:57:18,326
How can you be?

828
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:20,871
What do you mean?

829
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,620
Oh, darling I am your wife, I know
who you are.

830
00:57:25,852 --> 00:57:28,612
And I'll swear it in court
if you let me.

831
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:43,240
Loddon against the Sunday Gazette
and another.

832
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:44,930
Part 3rd

833
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,630
Jeffrey Buckenham.

834
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,050
What is your full name?

835
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:02,980
Jeffrey Buckenham.

836
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:06,410
Heh heh, Buckenham is on.
Buckenham is on.

837
00:58:09,379 --> 00:58:13,279
And you are the author of the letter
in the Sunday Gazette.

838
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,400
Yes.

839
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:16,960
Have you gained anything
by its publication?

840
00:58:17,507 --> 00:58:18,567
Not yet.

841
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:20,720
Do you stand to gain anything?

842
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:23,800
- A lot.
- Financially?

843
00:58:23,918 --> 00:58:25,828
- No.
- What then?

844
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:29,040
Personal satisfaction.

845
00:58:29,847 --> 00:58:33,257
- Mark Loddon was my friend.
- You say, was.

846
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,730
Yes, I said, was.

847
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,709
- He is dead.
- My Lord, I really must protest

848
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,750
against such a monstrous statement.

849
00:58:42,872 --> 00:58:46,682
- Unsupported by one shred of evidence...
- Really my Lord, my learned friend

850
00:58:46,804 --> 00:58:49,764
does more credit to his
heart than to his head.

851
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,630
Evidence will be forthcoming.

852
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,359
Now Mr. Buckenham you heard

853
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:58,300
the plaintiff described an incident
which occurred in prison hut,

854
00:58:58,355 --> 00:59:01,045
when you mistook Welney
for Sir Mark.

855
00:59:01,172 --> 00:59:02,952
Was that account accurate?

856
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:06,240
Part of it was but he left out a lot.

857
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:09,790
Would you please describe
the incident in your own words?

858
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,760
Well.

859
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,690
Like he said one day
I came in with the letters.

860
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:20,660
Letter for you, Mark.

861
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:22,940
André!

862
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:25,191
Oh, Merci!

863
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,030
That's not yours.

864
00:59:41,153 --> 00:59:44,113
All right, all right,
you boring Canadian lumberjack.

865
00:59:44,134 --> 00:59:47,044
- Just to remember you did give it to me.
- Well give it back.

866
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,810
You dirty, little thief.

867
00:59:57,477 --> 00:59:58,547
Welney!

868
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:13,100
Caught him reading your letter.

869
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,000
Our lumberjack friend
made a mistake.

870
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,930
He mistook me for you.

871
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:21,630
- I opened it without even looking at it.
- You liar.

872
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:23,940
You were reading
as fast as you could.

873
01:00:24,058 --> 01:00:27,378
I caught you reading them before.
Oh for Heaven's sake Jeff. Shut up!

874
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:30,160
Then you shut up too with all this
lumberjack stuff.

875
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:32,990
You both sound like a couple
of kids and you know it.

876
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:39,840
Fact is we...

877
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,890
we are getting on each other's
nervous, yeah?

878
01:00:46,181 --> 01:00:48,531
Not really surprising,
being caged up like this.

879
01:00:49,740 --> 01:00:51,680
It's a rotten thing, a cage.

880
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,230
I once had a bird in a cage.

881
01:00:55,660 --> 01:00:57,250
A linnet.

882
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,090
It was given to me by old Sal,
the gardener. My 5th birthday.

883
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,930
Cage was too small the bird was
always trying to get out.

884
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:08,720
I was used to imagine what it was feeling.

885
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,870
It must have been rather fun.

886
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:17,910
- All those birthday parties at Ingworth.
- Yes, they were.

887
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:23,950
Did you have a special one for your 21st?
Yes, I think so.

888
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,390
I have spent my 21st
in theatrical lodgings.

889
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,280
In...

890
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,270
in Darlington.

891
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:35,032
I don't think it matters
where you spend

892
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:37,029
your 21st As long as
you were with friends.

893
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,830
I was alone.

894
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:48,157
Always that same tune,
doesn't he know any other?

895
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:52,370
No letter again for you?

896
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,130
No.

897
01:01:55,807 --> 01:01:57,937
Don't have one for quite
a while, have you?

898
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:02,460
No, she stopped writing months ago.
I guess she got tired of waiting.

899
01:02:03,027 --> 01:02:04,267
Oh, I see.

900
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,990
Look, why don't you write to Maggie?

901
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:11,000
She's like it if you
did, she'd write back.

902
01:02:11,820 --> 01:02:13,610
Wouldn't she think it a little bit...

903
01:02:14,490 --> 01:02:17,530
She wouldn't be a little bit anything.
You don't know Maggie.

904
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:20,140
No, I don't.

905
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,400
What's she like?

906
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:25,970
Oh, she is American and very pretty.

907
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,960
I didn't mean that.
What's she really like?

908
01:02:29,892 --> 01:02:32,612
It's rather difficult to describe her
really. She is...

909
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:34,600
Well.

910
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,470
When you are with her,
you're at your best.

911
01:02:38,240 --> 01:02:41,880
Even quite dull people become amusing
when they are in her company.

912
01:02:42,686 --> 01:02:45,056
Even people you don't like
very much, you suddenly

913
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,910
you suddenly find there...

914
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,240
nice things about them.

915
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:51,710
Things you didn't know
were there.

916
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,010
Do you know what I mean?

917
01:02:57,712 --> 01:03:01,902
- Yeah, I know what you mean.
- Well, you write to her then.

918
01:03:06,410 --> 01:03:08,050
What happened with the linnet?

919
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:12,490
- The linnet.
- Oh...

920
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:14,954
I let it go.

921
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:22,330
So that would account for the plaintiff's
vivid memory

922
01:03:22,445 --> 01:03:26,425
of his 5th birthday present
from the head gardener, Mr. Sal.

923
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:29,840
Wouldn't it, Mr. Buckenham?

924
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:34,390
Yes. Yes, it sure would.

925
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:38,580
Did anything further come
of this incident?- Yes.

926
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:42,192
He kept asking Mark questions
about personal things.

927
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:44,840
Family,

928
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,980
servants,

929
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,480
even the furniture in the rooms.

930
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:53,490
I told Mark that he was preparing
to be his understudy.

931
01:03:53,605 --> 01:03:56,345
And if he wasn't careful, he
would take over the star part.

932
01:03:56,900 --> 01:03:58,570
At the time I was only kidding.

933
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:02,380
But then one afternoon I was lying
in my bunk,

934
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,730
well, he didn't know I was there.

935
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:10,150
Mark Sebastian Loddon.

936
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,510
I know you almost
as I know myself.

937
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:15,900
Better.

938
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,610
And this is one performance I can give

939
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:22,530
complete with affection.

940
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:26,330
A change of hair,

941
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,120
the change of voice,

942
01:04:32,350 --> 01:04:33,680
and I am...

943
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:36,960
Mark Sebastian Loddon.

944
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:39,720
Seventh Baronet

945
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:42,170
and owner of Ingworth House.

946
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:45,770
One of the stately
homes of England.

947
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,070
I'm also one of the luckiest men alive.

948
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:52,500
Margaret Madison, Maggie.

949
01:04:53,314 --> 01:04:55,094
The girl I intend to marry.

950
01:04:55,361 --> 01:04:57,131
I met in Ascot,

951
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:00,080
in 1939.

952
01:05:00,450 --> 01:05:03,470
Hey you, clown? You leave Maggie
out of this.

953
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:07,790
Mark.

954
01:05:09,482 --> 01:05:11,962
Our great actor was pretending
he was you.

955
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:14,690
He is taking over Ingworth.

956
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,720
I haven't taken over Ingworth
at all.

957
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,000
I was merely doing a little
impersonation of you

958
01:05:20,122 --> 01:05:22,482
which I thought I might do at
the Camp concert. Do you mind?

959
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:25,620
No, not a bit as long as it's good.
Let's hear a piece of it.

960
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,750
Really well you are the most

961
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:34,800
insufferable boor. I don't know
why we put up with you in this house.

962
01:05:34,923 --> 01:05:37,713
- It's very good.
- I'm glad you like it.

963
01:05:40,523 --> 01:05:43,843
Do you know one of the Poles actually
mistook me for you the other day.

964
01:05:43,865 --> 01:05:46,035
He must have been making
fun of you.

965
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,780
You know if you could dispose of me.

966
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,970
I believe you could go
back to Ingworth.

967
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,300
Take over.

968
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:56,453
And there won't be anyone the wiser.

969
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:59,080
Do you really think so?

970
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:02,571
I wonder...

971
01:06:06,550 --> 01:06:09,740
I might do it if you aren't
really careful.

972
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:15,152
Yes, Mister Buckenham.

973
01:06:19,528 --> 01:06:20,778
Yeah...

974
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,320
That's what you did.

975
01:06:32,344 --> 01:06:34,944
That's just what you did.

976
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,610
You killed him.

977
01:06:40,091 --> 01:06:41,831
My Lord, this is intolerable.

978
01:06:41,832 --> 01:06:44,740
Is there no limit
to the license allowed

979
01:06:44,861 --> 01:06:46,661
- this witness?
- Silence!

980
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,350
We appreciate your point, Wilfred.

981
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:53,750
- The witness will...
- But he did!

982
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:56,210
I know it now, I know it.

983
01:06:56,328 --> 01:06:59,948
If the witness's persist in interrupting I
will have him held for contempt of court.

984
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:02,486
Please, confine yourself
to answering the question.

985
01:07:04,390 --> 01:07:07,820
- Proceed Mr. Foxley.
- I thank you, you Lordship.

986
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:10,240
Mr. Buckenham about the escape.

987
01:07:10,952 --> 01:07:12,922
Was the plaintiff's account accurate?

988
01:07:14,270 --> 01:07:17,100
Yes, up to the point that I left him.
Then what happened?

989
01:07:17,606 --> 01:07:18,736
Well, I...

990
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:20,900
I managed to get some food

991
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:23,400
and I was making my way back.

992
01:07:57,874 --> 01:07:59,104
<i>Er ist schon tot.</i>

993
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,340
<i>Los gehen wir shon.</i>

994
01:08:06,623 --> 01:08:09,753
And you're absolutely certain Mr Buckenham
the body was Mr. Mark's?

995
01:08:09,775 --> 01:08:13,125
Certain. He was the only one of
us wearing a battle dress jacket.

996
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:16,780
Were you certain he was dead? - I know
that 'tot' is the German word for dead.

997
01:08:16,795 --> 01:08:20,625
And you're reasonably certain the
man you saw making off was Welney?

998
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:23,271
Yes, he was the only one was
wearing a leather jacket.

999
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:25,350
Thank you, Mr. Buckenham.

1000
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:33,280
My Lord, I will dispose of the evidence
of this gentleman,

1001
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,400
with the brevity it merits.

1002
01:08:36,250 --> 01:08:38,720
Although it's not strictly necessary
for me to do so,

1003
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:41,441
I will deal with the fantastic
charge of murder.

1004
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,040
You say when you returned from foraging,
you heard shots.

1005
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,810
- Yes.
- Were you...

1006
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:53,200
or Welney, or Sir Mark
carrying firearms?

1007
01:08:53,560 --> 01:08:56,370
- No, of course not.
- Well then I suppose you were right.

1008
01:08:56,494 --> 01:09:00,834
And the man you saw escaping was
Welney and the body was that of Sir Mark.

1009
01:09:01,290 --> 01:09:02,660
It follows, doesn't it?

1010
01:09:03,020 --> 01:09:05,900
That Welney couldn't
possible have shot Sir Mark.

1011
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,370
Kindly answer the question.

1012
01:09:11,570 --> 01:09:14,330
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Thank you.

1013
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,580
The jury may conclude

1014
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:19,910
that the man who was made
one wildly irresponsible

1015
01:09:20,029 --> 01:09:25,079
and palpably false statement
is not incapable of having made another.

1016
01:09:25,530 --> 01:09:28,640
And now let us turn to
this famous impersonation.

1017
01:09:28,990 --> 01:09:32,490
You say, you came across Welney
rehearsing an imitation of Sir Mark

1018
01:09:32,765 --> 01:09:34,365
for a camp concert.

1019
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:36,060
No.

1020
01:09:37,140 --> 01:09:38,410
I mean...

1021
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:42,180
What he was doing before he knew
I was watching...

1022
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:44,090
wasn't for his act.

1023
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:48,850
It wasn't that kind of thing.
He was practicing being Sir Mark.

1024
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,570
Did you like Welney?

1025
01:09:52,940 --> 01:09:54,260
I hate his guts.

1026
01:09:56,353 --> 01:10:00,533
So that your interpretation of his
intentions could hardly be impartial.

1027
01:10:01,460 --> 01:10:04,490
And so on the strength
of a five minute imitation.

1028
01:10:04,930 --> 01:10:08,910
You are suggesting that Frank Welney
could over the years

1029
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:12,622
have persuaded Sir Mark Loddon's
nearest relative,

1030
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:15,820
his family who knew him
ever since he was a little boy.

1031
01:10:15,938 --> 01:10:19,298
The lady to whom he was betrothed
and whom he subsequently married.

1032
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:24,010
You have the effrontery to suggest
that he could persuade all these people

1033
01:10:24,130 --> 01:10:26,280
that he was Sir Mark Loddon?

1034
01:10:27,980 --> 01:10:29,020
Yes.

1035
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:33,710
I gravely doubt that anybody else would
accept such an outrageous suggestion.

1036
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:36,390
Now then let us come to the escape.

1037
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:40,050
You said immediately after the shots
you saw Welney making off.

1038
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:42,240
Did you see his face?

1039
01:10:42,824 --> 01:10:43,844
No.

1040
01:10:43,957 --> 01:10:46,617
And the body on the ground
in British battle dress.

1041
01:10:46,984 --> 01:10:50,214
Were you close enough to see its face?
No, but I told you he was...

1042
01:10:50,231 --> 01:10:53,971
My Lord, on the witness' own evidence
it was dark and misty.

1043
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:56,090
He saw a figure in a leather jacket.

1044
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,200
He saw a body wearing
a British army jacket.

1045
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:01,260
And that was all he saw.

1046
01:11:01,910 --> 01:11:05,090
I don't think we need detain
this gentleman any longer.

1047
01:11:20,044 --> 01:11:21,734
Court will now adjourn.

1048
01:11:27,769 --> 01:11:29,029
Buckenham.

1049
01:11:30,199 --> 01:11:33,559
I don't suppose we should even be seen
together, but I must talk to you.

1050
01:11:33,588 --> 01:11:35,548
- Look, there is no...
- Listen.

1051
01:11:41,359 --> 01:11:42,719
You must listen to me.

1052
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:44,740
Before I saw you in the
witness box I thought

1053
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:46,508
you must be a madman
or a blackmailer.

1054
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,220
Now I know you neither.

1055
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,950
I believe you are telling the truth
and I know you really love Mark.

1056
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:54,250
- Thank you.
- Know one who didn't could have

1057
01:11:54,270 --> 01:11:57,250
described so well the Mark
that I fell in love with.

1058
01:11:57,870 --> 01:12:00,280
But now you made a mistake.

1059
01:12:01,210 --> 01:12:05,110
- Have the courage to say so.
- How can I?

1060
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:07,940
I saw him lying there dead.

1061
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,290
But you just said,
you couldn't see his face.

1062
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:12,110
How can you be sure it was Mark?

1063
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,880
Are you sure the man
you married is Mark?

1064
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,280
Is he the same Mark
you felt in love with?

1065
01:12:18,690 --> 01:12:22,340
Well, naturally because of all his...
Look.

1066
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,050
Do you think I like
doing this to you?

1067
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:28,750
You see.

1068
01:12:29,790 --> 01:12:31,520
I feel I know you.

1069
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,313
Because...

1070
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,960
well because...

1071
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,260
Mark talked so much about you.

1072
01:12:40,670 --> 01:12:44,190
Made me feel rather proud
because he...

1073
01:12:44,312 --> 01:12:46,842
let me share a little bit of
how he felt.

1074
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:53,230
- Sorry, I can't put it into words.
- You don't have to.

1075
01:12:55,263 --> 01:12:58,053
Do you know the last time he spoke to me
it was about you?

1076
01:12:58,165 --> 01:13:01,405
Was it? - Yes, it was that
night I went off to get food.

1077
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,690
He left Welney and came after me,
trying again to stop me and go himself.

1078
01:13:08,470 --> 01:13:10,710
He said that if anything happen

1079
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:14,410
would I take back the last thing
that you gave him?

1080
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:18,640
- Well of course I wouldn't let him.
- The last thing I've ever gave him.

1081
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:21,830
Yes, it was a little charm, a medallion.

1082
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,410
Well, of course I didn't let him...

1083
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,560
He didn't bring it back, did he?

1084
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:38,520
- I expect he lost it.
- And he's never mentioned it, has he?

1085
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:41,910
- He's probably forgotten all about it.
- The

1086
01:13:41,922 --> 01:13:44,052
last thing you gave
him before France.

1087
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:47,530
- He's forgotten so many things.
- Yes.

1088
01:13:49,090 --> 01:13:51,470
He's forgotten so many things.

1089
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,441
I'm sorry.

1090
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,500
Mr. Buckenham.

1091
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,170
Mark has forgotten so many things

1092
01:14:02,790 --> 01:14:05,090
much more important things
than my medallion.

1093
01:14:06,140 --> 01:14:07,730
But one thing I know,

1094
01:14:08,650 --> 01:14:11,260
he is not this Frank Welney
you described.

1095
01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:18,080
He is Mark.

1096
01:14:31,390 --> 01:14:33,560
Your name is Heinrich Schrott.

1097
01:14:33,676 --> 01:14:36,476
You are physician and surgeon
to the mental home at Cleaves.

1098
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,170
That is true for the last 20 years.

1099
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:44,140
Mr. Schrott is your English good enough
to enable you to follow my questions

1100
01:14:44,264 --> 01:14:47,774
without an interpreter.
Sufficiently, yes.

1101
01:14:48,040 --> 01:14:50,760
I've learnt the language from
a phonograph playing records.

1102
01:14:50,876 --> 01:14:52,856
- Splendid. I...
- Splendid, yes.

1103
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,740
I hope your memory is
equally good, Dr. Schrott.

1104
01:14:57,460 --> 01:15:00,110
Can you by any chance remember
something which happened

1105
01:15:00,228 --> 01:15:02,888
two days before
the surrender in 1945?

1106
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:07,290
Yes and no. So many things
happened those days.

1107
01:15:07,690 --> 01:15:11,990
Was someone brought to you who've
been found near Oxbridge over the canal?

1108
01:15:12,109 --> 01:15:15,589
Yes, a man in a British
army jacket.

1109
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:18,270
What was his condition
when he was brought to you?

1110
01:15:19,290 --> 01:15:22,080
Terrible. More dead than alive.

1111
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,920
- But he had not been shot?
- No.

1112
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:28,960
Skull fracture.
The face unrecognizable.

1113
01:15:29,081 --> 01:15:32,711
Right arm smashed,
we had to amputate.

1114
01:15:32,829 --> 01:15:36,919
You didn't happen to notice
whether any of the fingers were missing?

1115
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:42,480
No, it was an emergency operation.
I don't remember now.

1116
01:15:42,770 --> 01:15:46,640
- Did your patient die, doctor?
- Yes and no.

1117
01:15:46,764 --> 01:15:50,834
The body of my poor unfortunate
slowly recovered but

1118
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,640
the mind is lost, blows,
damaged his brain.

1119
01:15:56,758 --> 01:15:58,818
- I see.
- He breathes.

1120
01:15:58,940 --> 01:16:01,640
It is true he eats, he sleeps but...

1121
01:16:03,232 --> 01:16:04,572
he is not alive.

1122
01:16:04,689 --> 01:16:05,819
Doctor,

1123
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:09,750
the extinction of life
is murder, is it not?

1124
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:12,070
Yes.

1125
01:16:13,230 --> 01:16:16,820
Would you so kind as to tell us
what has happened to this living corpse?

1126
01:16:17,420 --> 01:16:21,030
Ever since he's been
an inmate of our home

1127
01:16:21,147 --> 01:16:24,197
<i>we call him Nummer Fünfzehn.
Number 15.</i>

1128
01:16:24,530 --> 01:16:26,020
Number 15? Why?

1129
01:16:26,137 --> 01:16:29,677
That's the number of his bed,
we have no other name.

1130
01:16:30,140 --> 01:16:34,830
I understand you can produce 1 or 2
exhibits associated with this sad case.

1131
01:16:34,953 --> 01:16:36,013
Yes.

1132
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:41,260
Khaki jacket. Number 15
was wearing at the time.

1133
01:16:47,660 --> 01:16:51,860
As the jury will see for themselves it
is that of a Major's of the British Army,

1134
01:16:52,350 --> 01:16:54,410
the rank of Sir Mark Loddon.

1135
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,100
You say Dr. Schrott no one has been
able to identify him.

1136
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:05,180
Isn't it possible that the sight of
a well-known face

1137
01:17:05,298 --> 01:17:07,958
might revive the memory
of this unfortunate man?

1138
01:17:10,020 --> 01:17:12,010
It's just possible.

1139
01:17:12,420 --> 01:17:15,270
Please, bring Number 15 into court!

1140
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,830
You bloody swine.

1141
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:04,609
Doctor, did your patient ever say anything

1142
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:09,460
even unconsciously to indicate his
assailant might have been known to him?

1143
01:19:09,584 --> 01:19:11,684
Might even have been a former friend?

1144
01:19:11,798 --> 01:19:15,428
Nein, nein, it was not a friend.
It was a murderer.

1145
01:19:15,838 --> 01:19:19,388
Is there anything at all about the jacket
that might indicate its ownership?

1146
01:19:19,417 --> 01:19:23,297
Apart from the fact that it belonged to
a Major in the British Army.

1147
01:19:23,630 --> 01:19:26,930
- Nothing.
- Then I need hardly remind the jury

1148
01:19:27,048 --> 01:19:29,788
that there was more than one Major
in the British Army.

1149
01:19:30,316 --> 01:19:33,796
Now I want you to be perfectly clear
on one point doctor.

1150
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:38,780
Nobody has identified him.
Nobody claims to know who he is.

1151
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:41,480
That is so.
And I'm going to suggest you

1152
01:19:41,488 --> 01:19:44,078
that he can not possibly
be Sir Mark Loddon.

1153
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:48,450
Since Sir Mark Loddon is here
alive and well.

1154
01:19:48,710 --> 01:19:51,300
My Lord, surely that's for the jury
to decide.

1155
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:55,490
Is this man Mark Loddon
or is he Frank Welney?

1156
01:19:56,070 --> 01:19:59,900
I suggest that after this evidence
the jury can give but one answer.

1157
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:02,670
That will be all, Dr Schrott.

1158
01:20:08,980 --> 01:20:11,300
Sir. Mark, I'm going
to call your wife.

1159
01:20:11,313 --> 01:20:13,653
After that evidence I
have no other choice.

1160
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:17,460
Sir Mark, this is our only hope.

1161
01:20:19,091 --> 01:20:23,471
- All right.
- Lady Loddon, please.

1162
01:20:25,450 --> 01:20:28,500
I would like your Lordship's permission
to call Lady Loddon.

1163
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:30,910
- Certainly.
- Lady Loddon.

1164
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:46,350
- What is your full name?
- Margaret Loddon.

1165
01:20:46,720 --> 01:20:49,220
Take the book in your right hand
and raise your hand.

1166
01:20:49,640 --> 01:20:51,370
Repeat after me.

1167
01:20:51,870 --> 01:20:55,320
<i>- I swear by Almighty God,
- I swear by Almighty God,</i>

1168
01:20:55,435 --> 01:20:58,305
<i>- that the evidence I shall give,
- that the evidence I shall give,</i>

1169
01:20:58,431 --> 01:21:00,541
<i>- shall be the truth,
- shall be the truth,</i>

1170
01:21:00,663 --> 01:21:02,823
<i>- the whole truth.
- The whole truth</i>

1171
01:21:02,935 --> 01:21:05,605
<i>- and nothing but the truth.
- And nothing but the truth.</i>

1172
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,950
You are Lady Loddon?

1173
01:21:10,220 --> 01:21:13,000
Wife of Sir Mark Loddon,
seventh Baronet of Ingworth Hall?

1174
01:21:13,116 --> 01:21:13,986
Yes.

1175
01:21:14,114 --> 01:21:17,714
In 1946 you were married at
Ingworth church.

1176
01:21:17,828 --> 01:21:18,828
Yes.

1177
01:21:18,993 --> 01:21:22,173
Was the plaintiff married to you
bearing the name of Sir Mark Loddon?

1178
01:21:22,193 --> 01:21:23,193
Yes.

1179
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:26,380
And did you at any time have any reason
to doubt his identity?

1180
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:27,880
No.

1181
01:21:28,340 --> 01:21:30,710
And do you still believe
that your husband the

1182
01:21:30,726 --> 01:21:33,106
plaintiff in this action
is Sir Mark Loddon?

1183
01:21:42,060 --> 01:21:43,260
Lady Loddon?

1184
01:21:53,610 --> 01:21:55,250
No, no he is not Mark Loddon.

1185
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:14,108
Silence!

1186
01:22:15,010 --> 01:22:19,840
Lady Loddon I feel we owe his Lordship
and the jury an explanation.

1187
01:22:20,980 --> 01:22:23,630
I called you to give evidence
for your husband.

1188
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:27,920
The court realizes that this trial has
been a very great deal to you.

1189
01:22:28,890 --> 01:22:32,020
Do you still wish to affirm
what you have just said?

1190
01:22:34,380 --> 01:22:36,700
I must ask you to answer
my question.

1191
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:38,740
Yes, I do.

1192
01:22:40,130 --> 01:22:42,080
What made you change your mind?

1193
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:46,890
What I have just seen and heard.

1194
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:50,990
But at what point did you know,
did you come to believe...

1195
01:22:51,940 --> 01:22:54,180
that your husband was not
Sir Mark Loddon?

1196
01:22:56,090 --> 01:22:59,060
When I saw he recognized
Number 15.

1197
01:22:59,970 --> 01:23:02,300
And that poor creature
recognized him.

1198
01:23:02,580 --> 01:23:05,646
I'm going to put it to you that you may
have misinterpreted what you just saw.

1199
01:23:05,670 --> 01:23:06,670
No.

1200
01:23:06,990 --> 01:23:10,990
I couldn't misinterpret the horror
and the guilt I saw on my husband's face.

1201
01:23:11,300 --> 01:23:14,740
Lady Loddon, you are married
to the plaintiff.

1202
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:17,250
You have lived together
as husband and wife.

1203
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:19,250
You have a child.

1204
01:23:19,750 --> 01:23:21,990
You've never had any doubts up to now.

1205
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:24,600
I'm going to suggest to you

1206
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:29,410
that the shock of your recent
experience has clouded your judgment.

1207
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:32,870
No! It is cleared it.

1208
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:37,870
I have always known that
the Mark who came back to me

1209
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:42,017
was not the Mark I knew
and loved before the war,

1210
01:23:42,762 --> 01:23:45,332
but I thought that was because
all he had been through.

1211
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,090
Now I know,

1212
01:23:49,590 --> 01:23:51,280
he never came back at all.

1213
01:23:53,620 --> 01:23:55,980
I have no further questions to put.

1214
01:23:57,424 --> 01:24:00,944
Lady Loddon believe me I would willingly
spare you any further questions,

1215
01:24:00,964 --> 01:24:03,914
but there is just one
that must be answered.

1216
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:09,230
Must not then that pitiful creature
be Sir Mark Loddon?

1217
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,040
Behind those terrible scars
couldn't you recognize him?

1218
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:22,271
No, I couldn't.

1219
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:26,239
But he did.

1220
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:29,149
I saw his face.

1221
01:24:31,670 --> 01:24:32,950
He did.

1222
01:24:33,590 --> 01:24:36,640
He did! He did!

1223
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,160
I think the witness should
be allowed to rest.

1224
01:24:41,630 --> 01:24:43,970
I have no further questions, My Lord.

1225
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:48,673
This noise in court, please.

1226
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:53,230
In that case we should
adjourn until tomorrow morning.

1227
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:07,900
Margaret!

1228
01:25:08,947 --> 01:25:09,977
Maggie!

1229
01:25:16,378 --> 01:25:17,648
Open the door!

1230
01:25:19,412 --> 01:25:20,702
Open the door!

1231
01:25:22,840 --> 01:25:24,080
Maggie.

1232
01:25:25,246 --> 01:25:27,586
If you won't let me in,
at least listen to me.

1233
01:25:28,660 --> 01:25:32,150
- Please, please, listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1234
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,710
Please, open the door.
I must see you.

1235
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:38,590
I won't come in.
I swear, I swear.

1236
01:25:47,290 --> 01:25:48,560
Margaret.

1237
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:52,240
I need you.

1238
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:58,800
- Who needs me?
- I do. I do.

1239
01:26:02,760 --> 01:26:06,040
The man you loved,
the man you married.

1240
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:10,050
- You did love me, didn't you?
- Yes.

1241
01:26:10,170 --> 01:26:13,200
And all through the years you
went on loving me, didn't you?

1242
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:14,110
Yes.

1243
01:26:14,230 --> 01:26:17,250
And it was me, wasn't it?
Not just someone called Mark Loddon.

1244
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:19,129
But me, me, myself.

1245
01:26:21,623 --> 01:26:23,803
Nothing can make that love unreal.

1246
01:26:25,392 --> 01:26:30,472
Yes, because you were unreal.

1247
01:26:31,528 --> 01:26:33,558
I believed you were Mark.

1248
01:26:34,182 --> 01:26:37,862
So I imagined I saw in you the man
I'd fallen in love with.

1249
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:41,280
The man who had changed because of
all he'd suffered.

1250
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:43,920
And who needed me all than more
because of that.

1251
01:26:44,392 --> 01:26:46,812
And I gave him all
I had to give.

1252
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:51,770
And now, now I find I've been living
with a stranger.

1253
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:53,469
- I love you.
- Don't touch me.

1254
01:26:54,038 --> 01:26:57,098
A stranger who stole my love,

1255
01:26:57,222 --> 01:27:00,682
my sympathy, my understanding,
everything.

1256
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:05,710
By a confidence trick.
It wasn't. You can't believe that.

1257
01:27:08,030 --> 01:27:10,870
You can't believe that everything
about me was false.

1258
01:27:12,890 --> 01:27:14,170
My love,

1259
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:17,860
my need for you.

1260
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:21,740
Not everything.

1261
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,580
Your terror was real.

1262
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:28,380
But it wasn't the terror of something
you couldn't remember.

1263
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:31,800
Your terror was of something
you couldn't forget.

1264
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:34,520
The murder of a friend.

1265
01:29:11,570 --> 01:29:15,460
My Lord, with your permission I must
bow to my client's insistent demand.

1266
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,520
That I should call him
to the witness box.

1267
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:21,020
- Certainly.
- Are you going to the box, Sir Mark?

1268
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:33,930
Sir Mark, you had the opportunity
yesterday of seeing the jacket,

1269
01:29:34,046 --> 01:29:37,476
produced by Dr. Schrott.
Yes, I did.

1270
01:29:37,597 --> 01:29:38,987
Whose jacket is it?

1271
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,370
I have no doubt at all
that it is mine.

1272
01:29:48,150 --> 01:29:51,540
- You identify it as yours?
- Yes, My Lord.

1273
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:57,000
You mean that your jacket was on Number
15 when he was discovered by Dr. Schrott?

1274
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,790
- Yes, I do.
- Will you tell the court,

1275
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:04,350
how your jacket came to be
on the man, known as Number 15?

1276
01:30:06,530 --> 01:30:08,100
I put it on him.

1277
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:13,590
After Buckenham went to find
some food that night,

1278
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:16,510
Welney and I waited for him.

1279
01:31:02,746 --> 01:31:05,176
I beat him and beat him.

1280
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:08,280
I only knew it was my life or his.

1281
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:11,010
And I wanted it to be mine.

1282
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:17,210
When he was still...

1283
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:21,110
I ripped off his leather jacket
and changed it for my battle dress.

1284
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:25,640
But they heard me and fired some shots.
One shot hit my hand.

1285
01:31:26,616 --> 01:31:28,806
But I got away and two
days later I was picked

1286
01:31:28,823 --> 01:31:31,033
up by a forward patrol
of British troops.

1287
01:31:32,410 --> 01:31:36,150
When you first gave evidence, did I
hear you take the oath?

1288
01:31:36,790 --> 01:31:40,000
Did you swear to tell the truth
the whole truth?

1289
01:31:40,330 --> 01:31:41,440
Yes.

1290
01:31:41,900 --> 01:31:43,920
Why didn't you tell
the whole truth then?

1291
01:31:45,110 --> 01:31:46,390
I did.

1292
01:31:47,550 --> 01:31:49,740
Up until yesterday that's all
I could remember.

1293
01:31:50,030 --> 01:31:53,910
And what is it that has so miraculously
opened the book of your memory?

1294
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,930
Seeing Number 15 standing
before me yesterday.

1295
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:04,070
For years now I've been haunted
by a sort of dream.

1296
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,980
In which there was always
mist and water.

1297
01:32:09,110 --> 01:32:10,990
And something moving in the water.

1298
01:32:12,040 --> 01:32:14,360
And running through my
head the fragment of a

1299
01:32:14,372 --> 01:32:16,702
tune always ending at
exactly the same place.

1300
01:32:18,180 --> 01:32:20,810
I only knew that these things
meant violence.

1301
01:32:23,010 --> 01:32:25,100
When I saw Number 15 yesterday,

1302
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:29,250
I knew quite clearly in that instant

1303
01:32:30,350 --> 01:32:32,440
that his terrible twisted face,

1304
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:35,260
was the image in the water.

1305
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:38,280
But I knew no more than that.

1306
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:42,930
When my wife...

1307
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:46,150
denied me in the witness box,

1308
01:32:47,711 --> 01:32:49,891
I knew quite clearly that
one of us was Welney,

1309
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:52,606
one of us was Loddon
but I didn't know which was which.

1310
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:56,500
- What then?
- All night I tried to remember.

1311
01:32:57,906 --> 01:33:00,176
And then just before dawn...

1312
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:03,320
I was standing by a canal,

1313
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,340
watching my own reflection
in the water pulling and twisting.

1314
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,610
And suddenly the tune started again.

1315
01:33:12,960 --> 01:33:15,430
And broke off in
exactly the same place.

1316
01:33:17,670 --> 01:33:19,360
And my reflection...

1317
01:33:20,460 --> 01:33:22,210
became his.

1318
01:33:23,420 --> 01:33:25,430
Twisted and mad with hatred.

1319
01:33:28,840 --> 01:33:30,450
And it was Welney.

1320
01:33:30,870 --> 01:33:33,860
And now my memory is quite clear.

1321
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:38,740
Is that the truth? Have we got it now?
Or are we still hiding something?

1322
01:33:39,890 --> 01:33:42,360
The truth is that
Number 15 is Welney,

1323
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,480
and I am responsible for him.

1324
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:50,060
So you admit to being a man capable
of a brutal murder?

1325
01:33:52,030 --> 01:33:54,920
Is there any evidence to
substantiate your story?

1326
01:33:57,030 --> 01:33:58,720
Apart from my own word,

1327
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,730
- No, My Lord.
- I see.

1328
01:34:11,626 --> 01:34:15,206
Mr. Foxely, would you like to make
your final address to the jury?

1329
01:34:15,660 --> 01:34:17,350
May it please, your Lordship?

1330
01:34:17,592 --> 01:34:21,432
Members of the jury. This case
which began as a case for libel,

1331
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:24,830
has turned into a case for
attempted murder.

1332
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:28,030
So it seems to me, members of the jury,
that you are confronted...

1333
01:34:28,151 --> 01:34:30,411
- My Lord!
- You're interrupting counsel.

1334
01:34:32,430 --> 01:34:34,920
May I be permitted to examine
my jacket again?

1335
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:38,060
Well certainly. I don't see how it can be
of any help to us.

1336
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,540
Asha, pass the jacket to the plaintiff.

1337
01:34:43,198 --> 01:34:46,408
There might be something inside.

1338
01:34:48,610 --> 01:34:52,100
Something I hid in the lining.

1339
01:34:53,290 --> 01:34:57,560
It should be a... little medallion.

1340
01:34:58,680 --> 01:35:00,720
Silver and the enam...

1341
01:35:01,880 --> 01:35:03,340
enamel.

1342
01:35:09,170 --> 01:35:10,660
Here it is.

1343
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:17,710
This was the last thing my wife gave
to me before I went to France.

1344
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:23,150
I even asked Buckenham
to give it back to her.

1345
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:25,550
If anything should happen to me.

1346
01:35:27,670 --> 01:35:29,240
He said nothing would.

1347
01:35:30,931 --> 01:35:32,331
Oh, my God!

1348
01:35:41,952 --> 01:35:45,462
Tell them. Tell them!
You must tell them!

1349
01:35:49,297 --> 01:35:50,357
My Lord!

1350
01:35:50,478 --> 01:35:53,698
If you wish to give an evidence
you must say it from the witness box.

1351
01:36:02,880 --> 01:36:04,220
My Lord!

1352
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,330
The story about the medallion
is true.

1353
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:10,600
Mark and I were alone
when he gave it to me, so...

1354
01:36:11,390 --> 01:36:13,680
Welney couldn't possible
have known about it.

1355
01:36:18,746 --> 01:36:20,806
He is Mark Loddon.

1356
01:36:34,924 --> 01:36:38,294
My Lord, it's abundantly clear that
the plaintiff has been the victim

1357
01:36:38,405 --> 01:36:40,015
of an appalling mistake.

1358
01:36:40,140 --> 01:36:43,790
If your Lordship will allow me a moment
to confer with the plaintiff's counsel

1359
01:36:43,794 --> 01:36:47,124
the jury won't be troubled in this case.
Certainly, certainly.

1360
01:36:47,243 --> 01:36:50,963
I feel sure Sir Wilfred will not find my
clients ungenerous.

1361
01:36:51,950 --> 01:36:56,160
I will adjourn the case to allow council
time to come to terms of settlement.

1362
01:37:09,350 --> 01:37:12,180
Will you leave the question of
the damages to me, yeah?

1363
01:37:12,820 --> 01:37:14,240
Sir Mark.

1364
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:18,240
Will you leave the question of
damages to me? - Yes yes, anything.

1365
01:37:19,490 --> 01:37:21,200
Enough to keep Welney for his life.

1366
01:37:22,244 --> 01:37:24,714
Congratulations.
I never had any doubts.

1367
01:37:25,170 --> 01:37:28,640
Come along Hubert. Your client can
pay for the champagne.

1368
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,610
That's not all he'll have to pay for.

1369
01:37:31,891 --> 01:37:34,821
My dear Mark, let me be the first
who congratulate you.

1370
01:37:38,652 --> 01:37:39,962
Thank you.

1371
01:37:45,619 --> 01:37:47,209
Hello Jeff!

1372
01:37:48,368 --> 01:37:49,958
There are no words.

1373
01:37:51,445 --> 01:37:52,825
Just thank you.

1374
01:37:54,820 --> 01:37:56,090
Thank me?

1375
01:37:58,300 --> 01:37:59,990
After what I have done?

1376
01:38:00,730 --> 01:38:03,400
What you have done,
you did for me.

1377
01:38:03,730 --> 01:38:06,810
And I shall never forget for
that, ever.

1378
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:09,660
You've restored me to myself.

1379
01:38:10,570 --> 01:38:12,350
You've given me back everything.

1380
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:18,590
Everything?

1381
01:38:24,905 --> 01:38:26,075
Yes.

1382
01:38:26,932 --> 01:38:28,122
Everything.

1383
01:38:30,347 --> 01:38:31,537
Thank you.

1384
01:38:37,602 --> 01:38:38,942
Darling.

1385
01:38:41,833 --> 01:38:43,223
Are you coming home?

1386
01:38:51,339 --> 01:38:52,709
Mark!

1387
01:39:06,705 --> 01:39:12,205
THE END

1388
