1
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,676
Tomorrow is the 3rd anniversary
of the Ark of Truth disaster

2
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:39,148
The religious cult introduced
a genetically engineered virus

3
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:43,779
into Tokyo's water supply,
which serves 11 million people

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:47,222
The contamination left

5
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,123
128 dead, and
8,000 others poisoned

6
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,194
Tomorrow morning at 8AM,
Memorial services will be held

7
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,428
for victims families at the
5 contaminated reservoirs

8
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:02,098
Those attending

9
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,266
will offer silent prayers

10
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:09,573
3 years after the cult was forced

11
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:13,014
to disband, former members have

12
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,846
again begun proselytizing

13
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,549
and they are once more under
police surveillance

14
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:24,853
Tomorrow, exactly 3 years after
the disaster, Victims Groups

15
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:29,093
are expected to appeal to the
government for strict sanctions

16
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,227
against any activity by
former cult members

17
00:01:33,326 --> 00:01:36,899
That's all for the news
Next we'll be going live

18
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:41,376
from the first round of
the 82nd Annual High School

19
00:01:41,468 --> 00:01:44,142
Baseball National
Championships

20
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,948
...No outs, runners on
first and second...

21
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:52,683
...the pitcher is ready to
throw his 4th pitch, and it's...

22
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:46,603
Hello

23
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:47,803
Hello

24
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,514
Time to check your temperature,
Tanabe san

25
00:02:52,272 --> 00:02:54,047
Temperature time

26
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:02,018
Your son's visiting you today

27
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:13,301
What music did you like back then?
What kind of music?

28
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:23,314
...we listened to lots of
recited songs.. .

29
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:28,648
And also... popular music,
old ones like...

30
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:23,035
We don't have any kids,
so bring yours to visit

31
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,268
What's her name again?

32
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,338
Ayumi

33
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,877
Ayumi? How old?

34
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,277
A year and a half

35
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,641
That's when they're cutest
There was a time when

36
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:39,454
my wife and I talked about it too,
but it's too late now

37
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:45,119
We gave up... Besides, it's so much
fun spoiling other people's kids

38
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,584
Hey you...

39
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:15,483
I'm home

40
00:05:24,624 --> 00:05:26,365
So I told the boss...

41
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:30,236
"Leave it all to Kai
and he'll do a great job"

42
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:34,476
I'm always telling him
to keep you where you are

43
00:05:34,634 --> 00:05:35,840
Thank you

44
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:39,279
I'm not like,
fishing for your gratitude,

45
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:42,982
but whenever you're
the best one for the job,

46
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:45,487
I'll tell him so

47
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:50,720
You take care of things like today,
everything'll be fine, OK?

48
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,055
Do my best

49
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:55,827
It'd be great if I could
get a ride with you

50
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:06,035
Which way are you going, Atsushi?
Mind picking me up in Shibuya?

51
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,974
See you there, then

52
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,415
Yeah, great, thanks!
Bye then

53
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,712
See?

54
00:06:19,846 --> 00:06:20,881
Who?

55
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,292
That's Atsushi, a friend
from high school

56
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:28,526
Says he wants to
get together tomorrow

57
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:30,533
Can I come along?

58
00:06:31,424 --> 00:06:33,062
Why not?

59
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,268
It's my day off and everything
Don't shut me out

60
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,467
I take you lots of places

61
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:42,171
Yeah, but I want to meet your friends

62
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,837
Cut it out

63
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,040
You're hiding something

64
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,618
It was a guy

65
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:50,584
How could I tell?

66
00:06:50,676 --> 00:06:53,122
I called him Atsushi, right?

67
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,985
You never know, could be a...

68
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:57,459
Oh, enough...

69
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:58,988
Can't fool me

70
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,622
Did you get sauce on my cheek?

71
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,219
Oh

72
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,226
Oh

73
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,007
Nothin' better to do...

74
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,746
She should get a life

75
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,847
I mean, all she does is spy on us

76
00:07:55,441 --> 00:08:00,413
It's not like they own the place

77
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,994
We live upstairs and
have a kid, that's all

78
00:08:12,358 --> 00:08:15,032
Her husband's useless anyway

79
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,040
Oh, there there,
now, there there

80
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,501
Papa! Papa!

81
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:49,266
She wants her papa

82
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:26,322
Hey, wow!

83
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:11,501
Hear that?

84
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,359
Those lilies?

85
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,460
Golden rayed

86
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:07,493
For real?

87
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,894
Yeah, for real

88
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:29,043
Guess they know not to grow low
where people can reach them

89
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,561
Wanna get one?

90
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,525
Yeah

91
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,793
Can you?

92
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,825
Probably...

93
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,900
if I really go for it

94
00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:55,709
I can get it

95
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:16,896
Impossible...
A little impossible

96
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:19,026
Kind of steep, huh

97
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:38,620
Oh, hello

98
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,019
Been awhile

99
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:48,890
Did you just arrive?

100
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,865
No, nodded off

101
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,397
Caught the first train
First one here again

102
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:56,332
Been well?

103
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,370
They're not here yet

104
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,108
No...

105
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:11,549
Do I reek?
Of booze?

106
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:12,918
Oh... no

107
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,633
What a nice day...

108
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:31,333
Yeah, I mean, last year
With all that rain...

109
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,772
Kept wishing I'd
brought rain boots

110
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,718
But this year it's good...

111
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,750
Looks like it'll hold

112
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:10,175
What the...

113
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,646
They're here

114
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,412
Thanks

115
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,050
Sorry

116
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,182
You're late, jerk

117
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:25,558
It's just there was this lily...

118
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,324
Right, forget it

119
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,128
Thank you

120
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:35,535
Been awhile

121
00:16:35,627 --> 00:16:38,471
Been awhile
Sorry we're late

122
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,043
Sorry, really

123
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:42,610
Hey, been awhile

124
00:16:43,068 --> 00:16:44,274
Been awhile

125
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,652
So are you still a teacher,
Kiyoka san?

126
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,082
Yeah

127
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,418
She could teach you

128
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,062
Yeah, I guess...

129
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:01,062
Still a student?

130
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,656
Guess I should get a little smarter

131
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,770
Kids get crushes on you?

132
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:08,166
No

133
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:09,735
Kids like me...

134
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,671
But they tease me

135
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:14,203
Like about sex?

136
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,843
Like what?

137
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:16,935
A fantasy of yours?

138
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,242
Always wanted...

139
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,839
Huh...

140
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,385
But like where do you live?

141
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,146
Really digging, huh?

142
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:29,021
Not digging...
'Course I'm on the outskirts

143
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,192
Apartment? Public housing?

144
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,565
Something like that...

145
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:37,793
Something like that?

146
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,599
How big a place, then?
A 1 bedroom?

147
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:43,632
Something like that...

148
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,506
Something like what...
C'mon, tell me! Ours is small

149
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,908
Hey, you're married?

150
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,778
Yeah, didn't you know?

151
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,815
Oh, second time!

152
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,352
Who asked you?

153
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:25,706
Right, when the road
gets so narrow...

154
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,720
Can you get the radio here?
Hey, what time, what time is it?

155
00:18:31,043 --> 00:18:32,181
Eleven

156
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,691
The radio, radio, the radio OK?

157
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:35,952
Sure, fine

158
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,327
Listen, today's...

159
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,796
Toto Engineering,
that was my school

160
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,336
That right?

161
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:48,402
Championships?

162
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:50,098
Hey, hey, hey, quiet!

163
00:18:51,563 --> 00:18:53,600
Tom's last championship

164
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,847
was 17 years ago, my class
I was on the team

165
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:57,777
For real?

166
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,816
For real, real! We lost in no lime

167
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,680
Bench warming right?

168
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:02,444
Position?

169
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:03,383
Me? Second

170
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:06,217
The earth's special at
the Championships Arena

171
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:09,888
When you step on
the ground there,

172
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:13,794
it's feels like super hot...
You listening?

173
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:18,295
The earth at the Arena, they use
volcanic ash from Kagoshima,

174
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:21,337
and special sand from
the Tottori dunes

175
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,167
Don't you root for Tokyo?
Your local team?

176
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,539
Never

177
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,611
Man, you're no fun

178
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,742
For someone who...

179
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:32,713
Hey! Hey! Hey!

180
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,250
Aren't you a little loud
back there, for real!

181
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,718
HEY! Turn it up! Louder!
Hey! Hey!

182
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:40,585
The second batter's cleared third!
He stopped!

183
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,922
Don't stop there!
Go, go go!

184
00:20:19,651 --> 00:20:20,493
Oh, that...

185
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,122
No, I got it

186
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:25,264
Thank you

187
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,837
What a crappy bike

188
00:20:34,866 --> 00:20:36,436
We're off, Masaru

189
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,775
Yeah, sure

190
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,424
Hey, gettin' cloudy

191
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,588
It's not cloudy,
just some clouds

192
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,523
Listen to this brat

193
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:13,512
What's that long stick, Masaru?
That thing

194
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:14,675
This? A flute

195
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:17,117
A flute? You sure?

196
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:21,089
Watch out for bees

197
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,750
Bees, right
They just love dark clothes

198
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:29,288
They can't keep away
I think you blew it

199
00:21:29,388 --> 00:21:30,833
I blew it

200
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,699
The flute itself was
made in Indonesia

201
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:39,809
Huh, got anything to
do with your brother...

202
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,671
Nope

203
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:46,543
Like praying for his spirit
or something like that?

204
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,708
Nope, not at all

205
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:48,910
Sure?

206
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,681
Thought it'd feel good
to play it here

207
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,199
Muddy!

208
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:16,245
Man, did I wear the
wrong shoes!

209
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,540
...that was sorta cool

210
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:08,864
You OK?

211
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:51,338
Gettin' hungry

212
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,272
Yeah

213
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,537
Sure smells good

214
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:59,712
Great weather

215
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,510
Ouch!

216
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,240
That's gotta be him

217
00:26:56,881 --> 00:26:59,225
I've seen that guy on TV

218
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,227
I swear

219
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,666
Kiyoka, what did you bring
for lunch? What's for lunch?

220
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:07,667
Secret

221
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,829
No fair

222
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:10,531
Have to wait for lunch

223
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,438
Did you pack rice balls?

224
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,372
Secret

225
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,843
Why? Don't be like that

226
00:27:16,901 --> 00:27:18,972
Man, that was good

227
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:22,678
Look look

228
00:27:22,941 --> 00:27:23,919
Woops

229
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:24,714
Lousy

230
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,981
Dropped it

231
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:32,258
Hey, I hear it's hard to make good
rolled omelets, you listening?

232
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:36,888
My wife says so...
Yours are better than hers

233
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:38,399
Really?

234
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,232
Guess that's not nice
Hers aren't so bad

235
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,170
How old is your daughter now?

236
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:46,105
One and a half
Listen...

237
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:46,902
Listening!

238
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,534
Ayumi!

239
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,373
Ayumi, huh?

240
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:53,347
She's still tiny. .. but she says
Papa and Mama, right?

241
00:27:53,438 --> 00:27:56,044
And when she's throwing
something away,

242
00:27:56,441 --> 00:28:00,150
she says "poi," like "poi"
It sounds so great

243
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,988
And my wife does
manicures and

244
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,652
you know those fedi...

245
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,490
Pedicures!

246
00:28:06,584 --> 00:28:09,929
Exactly, so those fedicures,
which my wife does,

247
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,400
she gives them to our girl,
too, and it's so cute

248
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:15,937
Just like little red rubies

249
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:17,569
The apple of your eye

250
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:21,633
Listen, you know, it's all about
having a family, you know

251
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:24,475
Makes you wanna work hard

252
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,579
Turn around, Kiyoka san

253
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:32,553
Oh, great, your dimples
were all adorable

254
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:33,988
Meaning?

255
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,852
I say let's go have dinner

256
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,483
Yeah, anything' s fine

257
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:46,435
Can't wait to get home and
give Ayumi her bath

258
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:48,501
Watch out!

259
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,799
Watch it!

260
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,716
What is this
Some kind of sick joke?

261
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:09,957
Is this for real?
The pits

262
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,723
What happened here?

263
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,528
Stolen... you think?

264
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:29,877
Time to call... the cops
on the cell phone, right?

265
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:36,746
For real?
For real?

266
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,720
No good
We're out of range

267
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,788
Real bummer

268
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,967
What do we...

269
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,642
It'll... work out...

270
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,621
Um, this was like...
Pretty far by car, wasn't it?

271
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:19,895
Quite a ways

272
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,191
Not walking distance

273
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:25,199
Can't walk it
Impossible

274
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:44,576
Leave anything in the car?

275
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:46,121
Oh, no

276
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:48,686
Minoru san?

277
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,854
Where are you going?

278
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,226
Minoru san

279
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:58,523
Let's walk back

280
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,494
Impossible, absolutely

281
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:02,536
No point staying here

282
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:05,735
Masaru,

283
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:09,711
staying here...

284
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,748
gets us nowhere
Time to walk, guys

285
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,848
Minoru san

286
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,122
Kai san...
Kai san!

287
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,393
Hurry before the sun sets

288
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:29,290
Can't camp out here

289
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,990
No, even if you walk...

290
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:36,772
Minoru san! You'll just end up
camping out anyway

291
00:31:37,095 --> 00:31:41,840
Listen, c'mon, let's sit down
and think this thing through

292
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,837
Forget it, I'll go alone

293
00:31:43,935 --> 00:31:47,747
We shouldn't split up
We better stay together

294
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,840
Calm down

295
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,749
If something happens...

296
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:52,647
And work tomorrow?

297
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,814
It'll turn pitch black part way

298
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,620
What, then?

299
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:08,337
You're...
with the cult, aren't you?

300
00:32:09,394 --> 00:32:11,601
Bike... yours?

301
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,731
It's mine

302
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,207
It's gone

303
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,505
What?

304
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:20,305
I think it got like stolen

305
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:22,549
What?

306
00:32:27,178 --> 00:32:29,158
Can't get back...

307
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:32,327
Be pretty rough from here

308
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,895
We're all related
to the perpetrators

309
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,104
We came to pray
on their anniversary

310
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:50,573
By car...
It was gone when we got back...

311
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:55,111
The closest...

312
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,652
No, there's nothing
around here

313
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,289
But you lived around here?

314
00:33:00,378 --> 00:33:03,222
Around here,
but it's still a good ways

315
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,529
Do you have a phone?

316
00:33:07,752 --> 00:33:11,097
We've got phones,
but we're out of range

317
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:12,634
Yeah, right

318
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,305
What'll you do?

319
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:22,476
The guy in navy
says he's going back

320
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:26,071
Oh, no, that's impossible
It's really a long way

321
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,451
But I've got to get back

322
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,178
Can't we go... there?

323
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:33,812
Forget that guy, man

324
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,858
Just wait a minute,
just a minute

325
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:40,158
I guess that's our only choice...

326
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,795
But... it's been
a real long time since I...

327
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,596
There's nothing...

328
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,967
Just having a roof...

329
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,176
I'm taking off, Masaru!

330
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,482
We don't have many options...

331
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:10,050
C'mon, for real
Listen, I'm serious

332
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:14,663
Forget it, why would I go there?
I'm not goin' there, man!

333
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:17,358
Why would I go with him!

334
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,438
You guys are crazy, man!

335
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:52,285
Pretty standard

336
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,024
Stinks in here

337
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:36,136
What, take'em off?
Have to take our shoes off?

338
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:39,366
No shoes allowed? Shoes off?

339
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,271
If you don't mind

340
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,038
What the...

341
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:01,586
Second floor?

342
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,828
Yeah

343
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,776
Years of dust...

344
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,264
Cobwebs...

345
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,450
Blech!

346
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:05,886
Rusty, rust

347
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,886
You all... lived here

348
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,929
Six of you?

349
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:54,734
Yes...

350
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,032
What'd you do?

351
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:01,134
We had a garden,
so we'd tend it and...

352
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:05,237
So you grew stuff...
and ate it

353
00:40:05,336 --> 00:40:07,043
Yes, we ate it

354
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:19,160
Like I told you, I'm Satoshi's
younger brother, Enoki Masaru

355
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,659
And she's...

356
00:40:24,522 --> 00:40:26,092
I'm Yamamoto

357
00:40:27,792 --> 00:40:29,772
Oh, Yamamoto san's wife...

358
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:37,543
And the one who wanted to
walk back before...

359
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,506
He's Kai san, Kai Minoru

360
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,954
And the one outside
is Mizuhara Atsushi

361
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,956
I think his sister was here...

362
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,894
Can you tell?

363
00:40:56,487 --> 00:40:58,296
Mizuhara san's brother?

364
00:40:58,389 --> 00:40:59,527
Yes

365
00:42:47,298 --> 00:42:48,777
I'm gonna go out

366
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:50,072
What, now?

367
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:51,339
Flight back...

368
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:52,971
It's getting dark

369
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,878
Be fine...

370
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,348
It's dangerous...

371
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:00,882
Wait

372
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:05,687
Take this

373
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:08,125
Thanks, be right back!

374
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,356
OK

375
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:34,015
We're getting, we're

376
00:43:34,645 --> 00:43:37,125
being contaminated,

377
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:46,301
in our everyday lives and
by the environment, but...

378
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:50,530
But isn't that what life...
does to people?

379
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,768
But don't you see,
that's your position

380
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,311
But you start to see the pollution,
once you really go there

381
00:43:58,435 --> 00:44:03,145
It's because you haven't truly
opened yourself, nobody has

382
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,514
But that's life, isn't it?

383
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:07,588
Don't you see,

384
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:11,654
you have to open yourself,
grasp the truth and then live

385
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:15,663
It's not about not living, of course
we live, we eat food and...

386
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:24,467
So when I'm there,
I engage in serious practice

387
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,336
What about Takuya?

388
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:34,314
We take him along
I can teach him everything over

389
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:36,348
First you open yourself

390
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:42,652
...that's our mantra

391
00:44:49,486 --> 00:44:53,332
Once you open yourself,
it comes out from a deeper place

392
00:44:55,759 --> 00:44:58,569
If you practiced there,
you'd discover it

393
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:01,609
It's inside of you
The truth is

394
00:45:11,742 --> 00:45:15,690
Let's go...
C'mon...

395
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:23,863
So let's go and then we
can come back here again

396
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,566
And talk it over again... OK?

397
00:45:29,526 --> 00:45:33,235
I'm...
I'm happy as I am

398
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:38,605
You're different now

399
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,546
We used to talk about all this
when we were students

400
00:45:47,511 --> 00:45:50,788
Why'd you have to become
this way?

401
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:54,295
Become so different?

402
00:45:57,721 --> 00:46:00,668
We used to be more serious

403
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:04,471
About the truth

404
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,132
About what
real education is

405
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:09,775
There's real education there

406
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:14,145
They've put me in charge
of education there

407
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,577
Let's work together

408
00:46:21,645 --> 00:46:22,783
Hey?

409
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:13,640
Go, go, go!

410
00:47:21,872 --> 00:47:23,681
Can I go pee?

411
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,811
The bathroom? Sure

412
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:34,452
Your arms...

413
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:04,652
It's kind of a waste,
though, isn't it?

414
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,123
All your medical studies

415
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:12,062
You've only got 2 years left, right?
You can still do it after that

416
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:17,403
I can continue studying
medicine in the Group

417
00:48:18,762 --> 00:48:23,768
And actually I can practice more
fundamental healing there

418
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:25,845
Fundamental? What's that?

419
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,488
Western medicine only
heals the human body, right?

420
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,353
Huh... really?

421
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,957
Why, of course
But...

422
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:45,166
What I want...
is to spend my whole life,

423
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:48,825
studying techniques of
healing the human soul

424
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,203
For real?
The soul?

425
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:57,267
Well, I mean, the thing is...

426
00:48:57,367 --> 00:49:01,509
They say "The healthy soul resides
in a healthy body, you need exercise!"

427
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,247
You always ridicule my ideas

428
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:14,185
I mean, it's interesting
and all, but,

429
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:17,890
I think it's fine

430
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:22,570
You know, for me, I can only
see and believe in my reality

431
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:27,065
It's fine that people like you
exist, we can't all be the same

432
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:30,839
Well, it's fine that people
like you exist, loo

433
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:33,813
Yup
It comes down to that

434
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:38,950
What's this "Cypress" about?

435
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,916
The thing about cypress...

436
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,719
I mean, wow!

437
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:57,302
It's not just a matter of
finishing the course work

438
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,605
I'm always good at that

439
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:05,807
Popsicle's melting

440
00:50:05,902 --> 00:50:07,347
What?

441
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:11,883
You want it?

442
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,184
Popsicles...
still upset your stomach?

443
00:50:20,751 --> 00:50:22,822
Why'd you buy it, then?

444
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,866
Still super- sensitive, huh

445
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,870
Did you ever learn to swim?
Learn to swim?

446
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,343
At the pool...

447
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,215
I broke into a cold sweat
just looking at the water

448
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,825
Dad used to throw you
into the pool, didn't he?

449
00:50:53,683 --> 00:50:58,132
And you never even tried to
help me either, like that time...

450
00:50:58,622 --> 00:50:59,896
Really?

451
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,401
Car coming

452
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:10,411
But the statute of limitation's up

453
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:15,607
I forgive you both
You and Dad

454
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:28,594
We part here, then

455
00:51:28,685 --> 00:51:29,288
Oh...

456
00:51:29,386 --> 00:51:32,560
I plan to leave the family
officially tomorrow

457
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:37,971
With Dad's memorial service over,
it's time for me to go

458
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:41,638
I won't be seeing you
again for a long time

459
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:45,346
Leave the family?

460
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:50,245
Your hand's sticky
from the popsicle

461
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,808
Come every year?

462
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,943
No, not every year

463
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:30,055
My first time back...

464
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,296
Your name?

465
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:36,761
Me?

466
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:37,456
Atsushi

467
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,500
Her brother?

468
00:52:39,589 --> 00:52:40,693
Yes

469
00:52:47,964 --> 00:52:50,740
What was my sister like?

470
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:56,514
She was a quiet person

471
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:10,294
What do you do?

472
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,732
I work in a flower shop

473
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:31,144
You got along?

474
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:34,820
But then everyone who
lived here got along...

475
00:53:35,745 --> 00:53:37,190
...well

476
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,565
Have you ever gone in?

477
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:47,259
Sure

478
00:53:47,357 --> 00:53:49,303
No, how far?

479
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,167
Pretty far over, actually

480
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:54,003
You mean all the way over...
to the other side?

481
00:53:54,397 --> 00:53:56,104
I don't believe it!

482
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,371
I have!

483
00:53:58,401 --> 00:53:59,744
All the guys have

484
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,645
I don't believe you...

485
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:02,944
No, it's...

486
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:05,676
But I've been here longer

487
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,448
But we really have

488
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:08,784
When did you go?

489
00:54:08,878 --> 00:54:11,620
Like when just the guys
came here and swam

490
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,626
Why just the guys?

491
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:17,460
Why?
Once in awhile, just the guys...

492
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:20,327
I've even shouted here

493
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:23,662
Feels really great

494
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:26,863
It echoes

495
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:27,600
No...

496
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:28,971
Really, really

497
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:34,746
Amazing, huh?

498
00:55:20,050 --> 00:55:21,620
Where you going?

499
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:23,222
Where you going?

500
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,061
Nowhere, really

501
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,435
What a pain to go all the way back

502
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:43,339
You see much of the
people you came with?

503
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,852
No, only rarely

504
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,582
We e-mail some, but...

505
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,524
Did you know each
other from before

506
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,690
your sister died...

507
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,393
No

508
00:56:14,971 --> 00:56:16,541
Just go!

509
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,182
I told you to get out

510
00:56:25,915 --> 00:56:27,724
Just go!

511
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:36,901
What are you doing here?

512
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:41,538
You're not involved, leave!

513
00:56:42,465 --> 00:56:44,308
Get out!

514
00:56:48,271 --> 00:56:49,545
Please listen...

515
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:52,677
No, you jerk,
this is about our marriage

516
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,457
Just get out.

517
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:16,176
You guys...

518
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:25,944
Do whatever, then

519
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,754
Sure fooled me

520
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:41,566
I thought you were awful serious
about yoga class, but Look at this

521
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,675
Some nerve while
I'm workin' my butt off

522
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:57,017
What the fuck!

523
00:57:57,106 --> 00:57:58,915
There...

524
00:58:01,578 --> 00:58:06,220
in the Group...
we trust each other

525
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,519
very deep!

526
00:58:12,422 --> 00:58:14,265
It's not your fault, dear

527
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,099
My fault?
You don't trust me, then?

528
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,804
But...

529
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,897
I try to talk to you

530
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:26,007
You were never really
willing to face me

531
00:58:27,370 --> 00:58:30,476
What I want is to

532
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:35,050
start my life over again

533
00:58:36,112 --> 00:58:37,523
Why?

534
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:39,852
Finally,

535
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:43,955
at last,

536
00:58:45,555 --> 00:58:47,762
I have something to live for

537
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,560
And what's that?

538
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:57,774
Something...
My marriage...

539
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:02,247
I didn't have at home

540
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,717
What happened?

541
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:21,301
Where are all your memories?
You're crazy

542
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,748
Have you been tricked?

543
00:59:39,275 --> 00:59:41,255
It's not funny

544
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:47,586
And with Miyamura, of all people,
what the hell is this?

545
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,526
After all I did for him

546
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:57,667
Who do you trust? Huh?

547
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:00,968
You trust him or me?

548
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,072
It's not about that

549
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:11,508
Who?!

550
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,778
It's not about you or him,
it's that,

551
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:23,159
I found a very
precious set of values there

552
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:32,169
That's called religion
You gotta resort to that crap?

553
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,274
No...

554
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:38,176
This jerk here was worthless
even in high school

555
01:00:38,267 --> 01:00:42,010
I had to find him a job,
which he up and quit!

556
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:45,184
Minoru san, your...

557
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,346
Cut the Minoru san crap!
Asshole!

558
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:53,657
You may think I'm a bench warmer,
worthless scum...

559
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,792
But...

560
01:00:56,152 --> 01:01:00,032
No buts around here,
I don't give a shit, just get out!

561
01:01:00,189 --> 01:01:04,296
I'm living under a completely
different set of values now

562
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,198
I've found the absolute

563
01:01:06,295 --> 01:01:08,138
What the hell's the absolute?!

564
01:01:08,231 --> 01:01:12,577
I'm telling you I'm not
the same person I was then

565
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:17,614
What the...
You guys haven't changed at all

566
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:21,279
You know what you're doing?

567
01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:26,022
You're breaking the law

568
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,524
You know that?

569
01:01:30,586 --> 01:01:32,930
Know what you're doing?

570
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,871
You're soliciting
You're swindling

571
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:44,404
Cut the crap, man

572
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:49,074
You jerk, you, it's like...
you can't get anything right,

573
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:52,347
so you just run
away from reality

574
01:01:53,309 --> 01:01:56,654
Cut the crap, man
You haven't even got a job

575
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:59,223
How you gonna eat, man?

576
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,027
Something's definitely
wrong, man

577
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:10,103
Then, Minoru san,
your reality...

578
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,229
Isn't it false?

579
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:13,568
What?

580
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:18,474
Get out, asshole!

581
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,945
Is it genuine?

582
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:22,209
What the fuck's “genuine"?

583
01:02:24,474 --> 01:02:26,784
Huh! What's genuine?!

584
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:30,682
Get out of here
Huh?

585
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:36,930
Enough of your crap,
you jerk...

586
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:41,495
Do you need this?

587
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,435
He doesn't need it, the jerk!
Just get out!

588
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,106
Dear...

589
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,080
Thank you

590
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:18,762
Oh, sorry...

591
01:04:00,603 --> 01:04:01,946
Thanks

592
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,089
Thank you

593
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:18,057
Sure is chilly here

594
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,128
Have a seat

595
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,935
I'm fine

596
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,440
Sit down

597
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:41,615
You're such an idiot

598
01:04:42,411 --> 01:04:44,823
Why'd you join the Group?

599
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:50,263
Well... I wonder...

600
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:55,731
Your folks?

601
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,705
No... I haven't been in
touch with them at all

602
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:02,969
Not even your siblings?

603
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,009
No...

604
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,078
Married?

605
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,874
Not married either

606
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:23,826
That Group...
was it like, comfortable?

607
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,965
It's quiet

608
01:05:35,965 --> 01:05:37,967
Very quiet

609
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:48,321
It's gotten colder

610
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,891
You OK?

611
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:52,391
I'm fine

612
01:05:59,922 --> 01:06:03,529
It's so quiet you
can hear everything

613
01:06:17,273 --> 01:06:21,551
I've just been wondering...

614
01:06:26,582 --> 01:06:30,530
What it was like for
my sister and everyone

615
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:39,596
Was it like a family...
Had a warm atmosphere?

616
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:44,372
Well, yes, in a way

617
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:45,775
You ate together?

618
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:46,903
We did

619
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,108
You all slept together here?

620
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:49,842
Together

621
01:06:49,939 --> 01:06:50,940
Upstairs?

622
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,815
No, not upstairs

623
01:06:53,876 --> 01:06:56,015
But all those futons

624
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:58,854
The police stacked
them up like that

625
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:02,421
They took everything else away

626
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:05,525
You all slept, lined up
like sardines in a can?

627
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:08,898
No, we all slept separately

628
01:07:08,991 --> 01:07:11,301
I slept in the living room

629
01:07:12,328 --> 01:07:15,901
Kai san, she slept up there,
where you were before

630
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:21,076
With?

631
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:27,245
There was Kai san and...
Mizuhara san...

632
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:32,425
Mostly. I think the women
slept in one room...

633
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,025
Huh... and the guys, were...

634
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:40,089
Yeah, in the living room
or downstairs...

635
01:07:42,425 --> 01:07:43,733
Earlier...

636
01:07:50,332 --> 01:07:52,539
I think it was my sister's

637
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:56,980
I found this by the window

638
01:07:59,108 --> 01:08:01,679
Its fragrance is gone

639
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,285
It's a daisy sachet

640
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:07,589
The bouquet you brought...

641
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:09,727
My sister's favorite

642
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,560
I see...

643
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:22,199
I haven't been able
to find anything...

644
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:29,843
But maybe that's
just as well

645
01:08:39,415 --> 01:08:40,655
Why?

646
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:50,595
We ended up here quite
unexpectedly, right?

647
01:08:53,729 --> 01:08:56,107
And I'm not sure

648
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,973
I'd know what to do,
if I did find

649
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,780
something of his

650
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,312
It may sound strange...

651
01:09:37,406 --> 01:09:39,647
Just between you and me,

652
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:45,283
the last time I saw him,
he left his shoes behind

653
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:47,283
And I've...

654
01:09:49,585 --> 01:09:54,000
I've never known what to...
I still have them

655
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:00,199
And if there was
something else of his...

656
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:05,674
You know...

657
01:10:52,514 --> 01:10:53,857
I want to go over there

658
01:10:53,949 --> 01:10:55,360
To go over there?

659
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:54,186
You can hear so many birds,
but they don't fly

660
01:11:54,276 --> 01:11:58,053
Yeah... they're just
hiding in the trees

661
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:10,762
Know the 5 conditions
of a solitary bird?

662
01:12:10,859 --> 01:12:12,065
No

663
01:12:13,295 --> 01:12:16,276
A solitary bird?
What's that?

664
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:21,404
The 5 conditions of a solitary bird
The first

665
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,039
The first

666
01:12:24,573 --> 01:12:27,076
First, the solitary bird

667
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:32,157
flies to the highest point

668
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,727
The highest point...
How high is that?

669
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:39,721
Higher than where
any other birds fly

670
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,961
Higher...
Huh...

671
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:45,162
The second

672
01:12:47,296 --> 01:12:48,798
The second

673
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:57,148
A solitary bird does
not suffer for company

674
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:03,184
even of its own bird

675
01:13:07,683 --> 01:13:09,492
The third?

676
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,133
A solitary bird...

677
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,807
Aims its beak lo the skies

678
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:29,247
What does it mean to
aim your beak to the skies?

679
01:13:29,671 --> 01:13:30,979
Like this?

680
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,677
Maybe like this

681
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,883
Looking at the sky?

682
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,456
Maybe...

683
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:43,996
See, that bird's high
It's flying high, maybe a solitary bird?

684
01:13:44,086 --> 01:13:45,394
Maybe it's solitary

685
01:13:45,487 --> 01:13:46,397
It's awfully high

686
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:47,626
So high

687
01:14:16,819 --> 01:14:18,196
Where's Masaru?

688
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,795
The bathroom

689
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,870
What a pee

690
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,268
How far'd you go?

691
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:28,102
Into the mountains

692
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,766
Cold in the mountains

693
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,037
See anything?

694
01:14:34,236 --> 01:14:35,738
Saw some beetles

695
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:36,873
Huh

696
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,044
Cold...

697
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:43,286
Cigarettes?

698
01:14:43,378 --> 01:14:44,618
Sure

699
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:53,097
Atsushi and Kiyoka, you guys
OK missing work tomorrow?

700
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,366
Not me, huh?

701
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:55,992
You're a student

702
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:57,428
I'm fine

703
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:01,797
And you?

704
01:15:01,897 --> 01:15:05,709
I'll be just fine...
We're all in this together

705
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:09,547
Tryin' to act cool...

706
01:15:10,639 --> 01:15:12,016
No, just kidding

707
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:13,347
You jerk...

708
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:16,252
You got a little sunburned

709
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:20,452
Sunburned? It was so sunny
Cut it out, you're blinding me

710
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,491
Really sunburned

711
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:24,427
You sure are

712
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:27,189
Teaching fun?

713
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:29,026
Sure it is

714
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:30,701
Go to work, come home...

715
01:15:30,792 --> 01:15:31,793
It's more than that

716
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:36,206
No, I mean, I'm sorry,
you go to work and teach,

717
01:15:36,598 --> 01:15:41,308
then you go home
What do you do when you get home?

718
01:15:41,670 --> 01:15:43,377
After I get home?

719
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:48,181
Plan my classes,
grade papers...

720
01:15:48,977 --> 01:15:51,514
Oh, right

721
01:15:52,014 --> 01:15:54,119
There's tests...
Just like you have

722
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:55,661
I don't have tests

723
01:15:56,518 --> 01:16:00,933
Only practical training,
so life's a breeze, breezy life

724
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:03,898
Have you changed jobs?

725
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:06,066
No, same job

726
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:08,268
What kind of work?

727
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:10,104
Construction company

728
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:16,049
Um... you wear a suit?

729
01:16:17,706 --> 01:16:20,414
Sometimes,
coveralls, sometimes

730
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,079
You like a foreman?

731
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:24,748
Stuff like that, lots of stuff

732
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:28,125
You tired?

733
01:16:28,650 --> 01:16:30,152
Exhausted

734
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,858
What were those flowers
you brought?

735
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,701
Those were... daisies

736
01:16:40,228 --> 01:16:41,673
You know daisies?

737
01:16:42,164 --> 01:16:43,040
Do you?

738
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:44,269
Nope

739
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:50,980
They were cute
You arrange'em?

740
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,949
Yeah, from our store

741
01:16:55,410 --> 01:16:57,321
They smell really good

742
01:16:57,879 --> 01:16:58,949
Yeah

743
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:05,289
Man I'm wiped

744
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:13,363
According to statements
made by Group members,

745
01:17:13,862 --> 01:17:17,309
the perpetrators bodies
were burned,

746
01:17:17,599 --> 01:17:21,547
and their ashes
scattered in the lake

747
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:27,618
For our part, we conducted
an extensive search of the lake,

748
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:31,819
but found nothing
No remains, no articles

749
01:17:34,783 --> 01:17:37,525
I've known him
since we were students

750
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,600
He's a very serious person,

751
01:17:48,597 --> 01:17:50,975
deeply committed to education

752
01:17:53,101 --> 01:17:56,742
When did you realize
your husband was different?

753
01:18:14,856 --> 01:18:16,597
Didn't you know?

754
01:18:16,858 --> 01:18:18,701
What? I couldn't hear

755
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:23,331
Your wife had an abortion...
Twice

756
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,507
It's all there in
the hospital records

757
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,443
When was that?

758
01:18:33,842 --> 01:18:36,345
Before she joined the Group

759
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,593
So you didn't know?

760
01:18:43,018 --> 01:18:44,224
No

761
01:18:44,619 --> 01:18:46,064
Which means...

762
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:49,931
She did it without
consulting you

763
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,178
Flowers meant a lot to...

764
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:03,874
Especially...

765
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:08,620
the lilies that symbolized
the Group

766
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,128
Always displayed
in the entryway

767
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,265
I remember that distinctly

768
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:25,298
Um...

769
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,863
Did you ever notice
anything about him

770
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:32,309
that may have predisposed him
to such actions?

771
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:39,410
I don't know... I mean...
From when we were little?

772
01:19:39,508 --> 01:19:43,513
Well, not necessarily from when
he was a child, but at any time

773
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:53,629
Was there anything?
I don't think so

774
01:19:54,055 --> 01:19:56,262
You didn't live together much

775
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:58,531
No, we did

776
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:02,634
But we never paid each
other much attention

777
01:20:02,731 --> 01:20:05,507
So, I see...
Huh...

778
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:27,199
A drag...

779
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:31,363
It's still comin' down
pretty hard

780
01:20:56,585 --> 01:21:00,465
There's a time
they call Silent Blue...

781
01:21:02,524 --> 01:21:07,064
I think that's my
favorite time of day...

782
01:21:08,930 --> 01:21:11,638
When night becomes morning...

783
01:21:12,667 --> 01:21:14,078
Is that

784
01:21:14,369 --> 01:21:18,044
the end or the beginning of a day?

785
01:21:19,474 --> 01:21:21,784
It's that moment,

786
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:26,087
when one day ends
and the next begins

787
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,386
I think maybe I'm

788
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:35,895
inside that Silent Blue right now

789
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:42,735
I'm participating in a history

790
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,912
that's about to end,
then begin again

791
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:05,959
Atsushi, you know,

792
01:22:06,955 --> 01:22:10,869
going back to that stuff about
God we were talking about

793
01:22:11,826 --> 01:22:14,397
God? God, huh...

794
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:20,207
Do you believe?
First, do you or don't you believe?

795
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:24,146
I don't believe in... God

796
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:27,009
So that's your...
So there's no God

797
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:31,315
Yeah, there's no what you
would call "God" inside of me

798
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:37,196
Don't you think humans invented
the word God in the first place?

799
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:38,787
I think so, too

800
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:43,632
So then, is there a God...
or what people mean

801
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:49,569
when they say God,
something like that inside of you?

802
01:22:49,898 --> 01:22:51,206
Yeah, there is

803
01:22:51,299 --> 01:22:53,176
But that's God, isn't it?

804
01:22:53,435 --> 01:22:55,472
For me,

805
01:22:56,404 --> 01:23:01,183
there really is something that takes
the place of a God inside me

806
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:05,418
I don't know that it's absolute

807
01:23:05,513 --> 01:23:08,619
But whatever it is that
I believe in that moment,

808
01:23:08,717 --> 01:23:11,323
I would call it
the equivalent of God

809
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:14,997
But ultimately God...

810
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:19,867
and righteousness
have been

811
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,436
used to justify

812
01:23:24,532 --> 01:23:27,536
things like
mass murder, right?

813
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:33,944
I think for me,
If I...

814
01:23:34,142 --> 01:23:37,988
were going Io hurt people,

815
01:23:38,246 --> 01:23:41,159
because I had those beliefs,

816
01:23:42,117 --> 01:23:46,827
then I'd much
rather choose a life

817
01:23:47,088 --> 01:23:50,297
of not believing in anything

818
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:48,386
Tamaki san

819
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,535
Welcome home

820
01:25:02,530 --> 01:25:03,804
Remember?

821
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:08,813
The poetry book,
“For you, my Students“

822
01:25:09,804 --> 01:25:11,283
What are you...?

823
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:14,084
Just listen,

824
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:21,517
"Arguing only from past history,
and from geological data,

825
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:24,927
all of the faiths and ethics
of our ancestors,

826
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:29,661
and perhaps even our own,
appear to be based on falsehoods..."

827
01:25:29,757 --> 01:25:31,532
Didn't you come home?

828
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:33,765
"...foreshadowing only
suicide and despair“

829
01:25:33,862 --> 01:25:34,397
Hey!

830
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:35,406
"Our petty..."

831
01:25:35,497 --> 01:25:36,305
Come back!

832
01:25:36,397 --> 01:25:39,970
Wait! "Our petty squabbles
in life and work..."

833
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:40,603
What is this!

834
01:25:40,702 --> 01:25:42,773
"...must now be laid aside...“

835
01:25:42,871 --> 01:25:43,872
What is this!

836
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:47,715
This is the part!
"The time is upon us to unite..."

837
01:25:47,809 --> 01:25:50,016
This is where his poem ends

838
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,315
I finally understand
what he was trying to say!

839
01:25:53,414 --> 01:25:54,825
What is this!

840
01:25:54,916 --> 01:25:59,592
Wait, c'mon!
I finally understand it...

841
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:04,668
What is this!
What about Takuya?

842
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:07,567
You don't even ask about him!

843
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,633
What about me!

844
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:13,142
Hey, read this part...

845
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:15,370
What is this! What is this!

846
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:18,644
Read that part, c'mon, hey...

847
01:26:20,575 --> 01:26:24,216
Head this, read this,
read this, here!

848
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,258
No! No!

849
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:31,223
Cut it out!
Stop it!

850
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:33,062
"...is upon us to unite..."

851
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,031
Oh... please!

852
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:38,698
Enough!

853
01:26:44,499 --> 01:26:46,308
Who cares about a poem!

854
01:27:47,895 --> 01:27:52,366
Yamamoto san? Let's see

855
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:56,137
He really looked after us,

856
01:27:56,571 --> 01:27:58,847
he really took care of me

857
01:27:59,674 --> 01:28:04,089
I guess...
'cause he was a teacher,

858
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:07,152
he brought us closer together

859
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:10,719
I was always kind of a slacker,

860
01:28:10,818 --> 01:28:15,426
but he was always serious.
Always thinking about everyone else

861
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:19,564
He was really generous...

862
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:49,495
Why... was he...

863
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:55,132
...one of the perpetrators?

864
01:28:56,698 --> 01:29:01,204
I wonder...
Yamamoto san was...

865
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:08,754
I mean it sounds strange,
but he was elite

866
01:29:09,277 --> 01:29:13,623
He was a gifted person and
I don't really know why he was,

867
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:15,695
but for someone like me,

868
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:19,695
to be chosen to join them,
I mean I was just an underling

869
01:29:19,887 --> 01:29:23,300
which makes sense,
'cause I'm stupid

870
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:26,294
I mean...

871
01:29:28,696 --> 01:29:31,108
When I was brought into

872
01:29:31,432 --> 01:29:34,345
his circle,
I was shocked...

873
01:29:40,742 --> 01:29:42,983
You know he's betrayed us

874
01:29:45,279 --> 01:29:48,260
He's the kind of elitist
who always runs off

875
01:29:55,089 --> 01:29:59,196
Don't worry, Tamaki san
will come back

876
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:02,500
He's just gone to bid
his wife farewell

877
01:30:05,466 --> 01:30:08,470
But if he does that,
they'll find out

878
01:30:09,871 --> 01:30:13,318
And so much for
all our plans if they find out

879
01:30:16,778 --> 01:30:18,883
He's definitely suspect

880
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:25,629
I mean he's always talking
about education and stuff,

881
01:30:26,354 --> 01:30:29,426
but when push comes to shove,
he takes off

882
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:34,499
Thinks he's elite

883
01:30:34,695 --> 01:30:38,541
And you, Sakata? No regrets
about leaving that world?

884
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:41,910
I don't think so...

885
01:30:43,805 --> 01:30:45,512
None at all

886
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,455
Is it really going to work?

887
01:30:57,285 --> 01:30:59,925
I know we have to
make it work, but...

888
01:31:02,723 --> 01:31:05,966
I guess we've all
got to make it work...

889
01:31:14,569 --> 01:31:16,048
It'll work

890
01:31:22,243 --> 01:31:25,019
I don't know who's
expecting what...

891
01:31:25,313 --> 01:31:28,817
Not that I need anybody's
expectations, it's up to me, but...

892
01:32:12,326 --> 01:32:14,602
It's all going to end, isn't it?

893
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,938
It's not ending

894
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:24,382
It's not ending,
but I kind of like living here...

895
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,152
So it's kind of sad that
I won't have that any more

896
01:32:28,910 --> 01:32:30,218
I'm glad

897
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:34,926
I'm really glad that
I got to meet you here

898
01:32:44,825 --> 01:32:48,272
Oh boy, it's raining hard again

899
01:33:01,842 --> 01:33:03,082
Thank you

900
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:11,060
Wanna escape?

901
01:33:13,754 --> 01:33:17,361
It'll be fine, it'll definitely work
We'll succeed

902
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:21,665
I mean we've already made up
our minds, right?

903
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:24,072
So we can escape

904
01:33:24,365 --> 01:33:27,278
Having made up
our minds is plenty

905
01:33:29,203 --> 01:33:31,114
Let's take off together

906
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:37,823
Of course you won't...

907
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,418
We'll definitely succeed!

908
01:33:47,388 --> 01:33:49,265
We'll succeed

909
01:33:49,490 --> 01:33:51,367
Yeah, sure, but...

910
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,338
How do we do this?

911
01:34:00,434 --> 01:34:01,913
Put that on...

912
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:07,715
Put that one under...

913
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:34,071
Sakata san, why don't
you come by the fire

914
01:34:45,746 --> 01:34:46,690
Sure's cold

915
01:34:46,781 --> 01:34:48,158
Sure is

916
01:34:56,390 --> 01:34:58,392
It's wet, but go ahead

917
01:35:01,228 --> 01:35:03,174
Can I have one?

918
01:35:33,994 --> 01:35:35,405
Back then...

919
01:35:37,665 --> 01:35:40,669
Yeah, we'd light
fires just like this

920
01:35:59,987 --> 01:36:04,299
You couldn't have stopped
them, Sakata san?

921
01:36:11,899 --> 01:36:15,745
There's really nothing
to say about that

922
01:36:24,311 --> 01:36:28,589
All kinds of people
have asked me that...

923
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:32,061
I've even been attacked for it,

924
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:34,926
just walking down the street

925
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:41,506
But you had to... some things you
would only know if you were here

926
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:48,202
And I didn't mean to betray them,
but it turned out that way

927
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:52,541
I wanted to be part of
them, still, and if possible,

928
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:56,380
if we could all agree

929
01:36:57,244 --> 01:37:01,283
to take things in a different
direction, that's what I'd hoped

930
01:37:05,586 --> 01:37:08,658
But there really are some
things you can't possibly

931
01:37:09,056 --> 01:37:11,229
understand if you weren't here

932
01:37:25,706 --> 01:37:27,811
Did you sleep?

933
01:37:27,908 --> 01:37:29,285
A little

934
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:58,085
Really, it's that I got sucked into
their way of thinking

935
01:40:58,185 --> 01:41:01,689
and it carried me away,
that's what I think

936
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:11,098
But after everything in
this world is washed away

937
01:41:11,298 --> 01:41:15,974
only the chosen few will remain
That's what they teach, isn't it?

938
01:41:16,603 --> 01:41:17,673
What's that?

939
01:41:17,771 --> 01:41:21,742
Well... I don't know...
I don't really...

940
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:22,877
Don't "well..." me

941
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:26,651
Well... considering who I am.
I probably

942
01:41:26,847 --> 01:41:28,053
couldn't comprehend it

943
01:41:28,248 --> 01:41:31,286
They didn't tell me anything
while I was there

944
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:34,525
I just sensed that maybe

945
01:41:34,621 --> 01:41:38,228
all kinds of horrible
things might happen

946
01:41:38,325 --> 01:41:42,569
and I was afraid of what would happen
to me if I stayed around for it

947
01:41:43,297 --> 01:41:45,072
I couldn't stop it...

948
01:41:45,499 --> 01:41:50,039
I wonder what the other five
think of you now

949
01:41:52,239 --> 01:41:56,278
Surely, some of them
really cared about you

950
01:41:56,543 --> 01:41:58,887
Well... I don't really think

951
01:41:58,979 --> 01:42:01,823
I was involved so deeply

952
01:42:03,550 --> 01:42:06,793
So I don't know what
they'd think of me

953
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:10,665
and I didn't know what
they were thinking then

954
01:42:10,891 --> 01:42:13,462
I bet they think
you betrayed them

955
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:17,064
Well... maybe they
think I betrayed them...

956
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:21,970
But from my point of view,
they were the crazy ones

957
01:42:23,937 --> 01:42:28,886
I don't like to think I belong
with people who'd do such things

958
01:42:32,880 --> 01:42:35,690
I mean, it's obvious,
they're the crazy ones

959
01:42:35,782 --> 01:42:39,457
So even if they think
I betrayed them,

960
01:42:42,389 --> 01:42:46,496
it wouldn’t mean anything to me
Fine, let them think I betrayed them

961
01:42:49,329 --> 01:42:51,070
So for you...

962
01:42:51,165 --> 01:42:55,409
You'd rather they
just disappeared?

963
01:42:57,104 --> 01:42:59,380
Yeah, I guess
Yeah, definitely

964
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:02,118
Because for me

965
01:43:02,209 --> 01:43:05,782
the truth is, I don't care
about them anymore

966
01:43:05,879 --> 01:43:07,290
You know,

967
01:43:07,581 --> 01:43:11,085
he's dead, your leader

968
01:43:12,252 --> 01:43:15,722
Couldn't take the pressure
Killed himself

969
01:43:17,457 --> 01:43:19,937
Just what you wanted, huh?

970
01:43:20,227 --> 01:43:22,935
No, it's not what
I wanted, but...

971
01:43:23,630 --> 01:43:28,170
I guess in a way...
Is that really true?

972
01:43:42,115 --> 01:43:45,028
They were like...
"Is your,

973
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:49,961
is your life genuine..."
and like...

974
01:43:56,296 --> 01:43:57,775
Minoru san,

975
01:43:59,333 --> 01:44:02,644
"is your life genuine..."
that's what they said

976
01:44:13,714 --> 01:44:15,819
Maybe I'm running away

977
01:44:17,217 --> 01:44:20,494
I don't know,
I really don't know

978
01:44:21,955 --> 01:44:23,195
But...

979
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:31,474
Is it really so bad
to run away?

980
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:55,563
Were you close to your sister?

981
01:44:55,789 --> 01:44:57,234
We were

982
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:00,603
You don't resemble her

983
01:45:00,894 --> 01:45:02,032
I don't?

984
01:45:06,633 --> 01:45:07,976
She was older by...

985
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:09,376
Two years

986
01:45:13,173 --> 01:45:14,743
Don't resemble her?

987
01:45:57,484 --> 01:45:59,964
What was the leader like?

988
01:46:00,921 --> 01:46:05,392
The leader...
Well...

989
01:46:05,592 --> 01:46:10,405
When I first joined, it's...

990
01:46:11,765 --> 01:46:15,440
kind of embarrassing,
but he was like a father

991
01:46:15,702 --> 01:46:18,308
When I first joined,

992
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:22,142
it wasn't such a big

993
01:46:23,076 --> 01:46:25,420
religious organization,

994
01:46:26,747 --> 01:46:30,718
so it felt something like
a family, he was like the father

995
01:46:42,929 --> 01:46:45,341
And now...

996
01:46:45,432 --> 01:46:48,208
What do you think about him now?

997
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:52,013
I don't think about
him at all now

998
01:47:18,999 --> 01:47:20,410
Shall we go?

999
01:50:04,764 --> 01:50:05,936
Thanks

1000
01:50:46,406 --> 01:50:48,477
Drink some, Atsushi

1001
01:51:02,756 --> 01:51:03,928
Tastes great!

1002
01:51:04,024 --> 01:51:05,560
I'd like an egg on that

1003
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:08,265
An egg, oh, sure

1004
01:51:14,534 --> 01:51:16,707
There you go

1005
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:26,055
That's mine!

1006
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:29,593
Hello

1007
01:51:35,588 --> 01:51:39,161
Um...
Listen...

1008
01:51:39,392 --> 01:51:40,837
It's that...

1009
01:51:51,604 --> 01:51:55,017
Um...
No, like stuff happened

1010
01:51:55,108 --> 01:51:58,055
Um, we had to stay over...

1011
01:51:59,746 --> 01:52:01,851
of course I didn't!

1012
01:52:06,252 --> 01:52:08,664
No way I'd do that, c'mon

1013
01:52:10,757 --> 01:52:13,294
Your noodles are ready

1014
01:52:28,408 --> 01:52:31,082
I'm sorry, that OK?

1015
01:52:31,177 --> 01:52:33,919
I'm sorry, thank you

1016
01:52:38,384 --> 01:52:40,330
There are your noodles

1017
01:52:40,420 --> 01:52:41,558
Thank you

1018
01:52:42,555 --> 01:52:44,626
No I did not!

1019
01:52:46,459 --> 01:52:48,132
I'm totally fine

1020
01:52:53,366 --> 01:52:54,106
Thanks

1021
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,543
Enjoy

1022
01:53:10,350 --> 01:53:13,854
I'll explain it later...
OK, of course not

1023
01:54:34,367 --> 01:54:36,244
Coming back next year?

1024
01:54:40,006 --> 01:54:42,816
There's one thing that bothers me

1025
01:54:46,179 --> 01:54:48,022
Who are you, really?

1026
01:54:49,582 --> 01:54:53,792
Um...
Are you really her brother?

1027
01:54:54,153 --> 01:54:58,624
Yes I am
Why? What is it?

1028
01:55:00,360 --> 01:55:02,772
The thing is, what I heard,

1029
01:55:03,129 --> 01:55:07,544
was that her brother had
killed himself a few years back

1030
01:55:11,337 --> 01:55:13,339
That's what my sister said?

1031
01:55:13,506 --> 01:55:14,746
That's right

1032
01:55:24,550 --> 01:55:26,291
She probably lied

1033
01:55:26,386 --> 01:55:27,592
No...

1034
01:55:30,123 --> 01:55:32,228
If she were lying...

1035
01:55:35,161 --> 01:55:37,732
She wouldn't have
said it that way

1036
01:55:39,198 --> 01:55:42,873
We're about to reach
our final destination

1037
01:55:43,002 --> 01:55:45,983
Please take all your
belongings with you

1038
01:55:46,072 --> 01:55:50,248
Thank you for riding
Japan Hallways today

1039
01:55:50,343 --> 01:55:52,516
Thank you for your patronage

1040
01:56:12,231 --> 01:56:14,006
I'm off then

1041
01:56:16,235 --> 01:56:19,876
OK then, see you next year

1042
01:57:27,707 --> 01:57:31,450
Tanabe san passed away
Three days ago

1043
01:57:33,946 --> 01:57:38,224
I just assumed
you were his son...

1044
01:57:40,319 --> 01:57:42,321
But you're not

1045
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:45,901
His real son came...

1046
01:57:47,360 --> 01:57:52,002
He never visited while
his father was alive, but...

1047
01:57:53,366 --> 01:57:56,506
Who exactly are...

1048
01:58:06,979 --> 01:58:09,550
You regret marrying me, don't you?

1049
01:58:11,317 --> 01:58:15,823
What about the children?
Don't you love them?

1050
01:58:44,217 --> 01:58:48,063
You work in a flower
shop, too, don't you?

1051
01:58:48,154 --> 01:58:49,258
Yes

1052
01:59:02,168 --> 01:59:03,647
Flowers?

1053
01:59:03,836 --> 01:59:05,873
I love flowers

1054
01:59:23,289 --> 01:59:25,269
Were you influenced?

1055
01:59:38,437 --> 01:59:42,579
I don't think
I was influenced...

1056
01:59:50,082 --> 01:59:54,292
But I remember the smell
of the lilies vividly

1057
02:00:02,128 --> 02:00:04,802
I don't think I was influenced

1058
02:00:35,861 --> 02:00:37,204
One out!

1059
02:00:37,496 --> 02:00:38,736
OK, here, bring some water

1060
02:00:38,831 --> 02:00:40,640
Infield, throw to first!

1061
02:00:42,134 --> 02:00:43,772
Run, run!

1062
02:00:43,936 --> 02:00:46,678
When you get the ball,
it's one two!

1063
02:00:46,839 --> 02:00:48,341
Move in, in, in!

1064
02:00:48,574 --> 02:00:53,683
That ball wasn't
for the shortstop!

1065
02:00:53,980 --> 02:00:57,518
Who's faster, shortstop
or second base, huh?

1066
02:00:58,684 --> 02:01:00,857
Keep alert, now!

1067
02:01:01,854 --> 02:01:05,597
Don't bother answering me!
Be serious!

1068
02:01:06,259 --> 02:01:08,261
Keep your eye on the ball!

1069
02:01:11,731 --> 02:01:13,711
Oh, and this is great, too

1070
02:01:15,768 --> 02:01:17,145
Pretty, right?

1071
02:01:20,873 --> 02:01:23,945
Somehow she's always
in the picture

1072
02:01:26,746 --> 02:01:31,286
Look, this guy sitting
there's Minoru

1073
02:01:32,785 --> 02:01:35,197
He's that type, huh?

1074
02:01:35,521 --> 02:01:37,933
Yeah, we're pretty alike

1075
02:01:38,557 --> 02:01:40,298
All different ages?

1076
02:01:40,393 --> 02:01:41,531
Yeah

1077
02:01:46,432 --> 02:01:51,040
This is when our car
got stolen at the end

1078
02:01:52,104 --> 02:01:53,344
Car got stolen?

1079
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:54,918
Yeah, what a mess

1080
02:01:55,007 --> 02:01:56,645
What a drag!

1081
02:01:56,742 --> 02:02:00,349
That's why
my phone didn't work

1082
02:02:02,348 --> 02:02:06,558
But from now on, can't you
try to not get so hysterical?

1083
02:02:07,987 --> 02:02:09,227
But

1084
02:02:10,056 --> 02:02:13,128
But you said you
were coming back

1085
02:02:13,626 --> 02:02:15,765
and you didn't...

1086
02:02:16,395 --> 02:02:18,602
I thought something'd
happened

1087
02:02:18,698 --> 02:02:19,438
Something did

1088
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:22,012
I couldn't sleep,
kept calling

1089
02:02:22,101 --> 02:02:23,580
I was fine...

1090
02:02:24,603 --> 02:02:29,552
But you were in your pajamas, right?
You were all ready to go to sleep

1091
02:02:29,809 --> 02:02:31,914
What's the difference!

1092
02:02:36,082 --> 02:02:39,859
You always say stuff like that
and lie to me, Masaru

1093
02:02:42,621 --> 02:02:44,294
Can you swim?

1094
02:02:45,391 --> 02:02:47,132
You know how to swim?

1095
02:02:48,294 --> 02:02:52,936
I can't
Didn't I tell you, I can't swim

1096
02:02:55,568 --> 02:02:57,309
I'll teach you how

1097
02:02:57,403 --> 02:02:58,643
Why?

1098
02:03:00,005 --> 02:03:01,382
Why?

1099
02:03:54,026 --> 02:03:55,369
Hello?

1100
02:03:59,598 --> 02:04:01,942
Oh, Takuya?

1101
02:04:11,610 --> 02:04:15,114
Yeah
How was it?

1102
02:04:20,586 --> 02:04:23,294
Oh, that's wonderful

1103
02:04:30,563 --> 02:04:32,133
Really?

1104
02:04:35,468 --> 02:04:37,277
How's grandpa?

1105
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:51,021
That might be a little difficult

1106
02:07:45,591 --> 02:07:47,070
Father...

1107
02:09:57,856 --> 02:10:01,360
