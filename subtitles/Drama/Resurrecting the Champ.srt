150
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:32,176
<i>Recognize your weaknesses and fix 'em.</i>

151
00:09:32,218 --> 00:09:36,097
Slow down a bit, you know?
Think quality.

152
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:39,767
I got it. Got an appointment.

153
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,438
<i>We write it like this.</i>

154
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:46,107
What the lawsuit is calling for
is an order to force the E.P. A...

155
00:09:46,191 --> 00:09:48,235
to reassign its approval
over the water standards...

156
00:09:48,318 --> 00:09:50,737
for the rivers
affected by the development.

157
00:09:50,779 --> 00:09:54,575
Mm-hmm. Wyoming and Montana
are going to join as interveners.

158
00:09:54,658 --> 00:09:56,577
Okay.

159
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,456
- Hey, was that you calling last night?
- Yeah, yeah, it was.

160
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,792
Sorry about that.

161
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:05,795
Hey, did you read the article-
Jermaine fight?

162
00:10:05,878 --> 00:10:07,797
Yeah. It was good.

163
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,799
- It was, wasn't it?
- Very solid.

164
00:10:09,882 --> 00:10:12,635
Yeah, solid. Exactly.
Metz hated it. Of course.

165
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:14,220
What didn't he like?

166
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:18,225
What does Metz-

167
00:10:18,308 --> 00:10:21,979
[Quieter] What does Metz ever like?
I don't know. He wasn't specific.

168
00:10:22,062 --> 00:10:25,232
[Sighs] You know,
he's never going to let me write...

169
00:10:25,274 --> 00:10:27,276
on the Broncos or the Nuggets.

170
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:29,987
Well, maybe Metz will come around.

171
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:35,743
It doesn't really matter because,
um, I'm having lunch with Whitley.

172
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,328
<i>Today.</i>

173
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:39,748
I might have a shot at the magazine.

174
00:10:39,831 --> 00:10:42,500
<i>- [Chuckles] That's great.
- Yeah, it is.</i>

175
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:45,337
- That is great.
- Nothing certain yet,
but it seems pretty positive.

176
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,339
<i>- That's fantastic.
- Yep.</i>

177
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:49,091
Does Metz know?

178
00:10:49,174 --> 00:10:52,928
Are you serious?
What are you on?

179
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:54,972
No, Metz doesn't know.

180
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,730
Hey, I was wondering if I could shoot
some hoops with Teddy this afternoon.

181
00:11:02,814 --> 00:11:04,732
You know,
Teddy's only gonna get used to this...

182
00:11:04,816 --> 00:11:06,776
if we stick on the schedule
that we agreed on.

183
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,154
We're separated, okay?

184
00:11:09,237 --> 00:11:13,492
It's easy for you to say. You haven't
had your son cleaved from you.

185
00:11:15,577 --> 00:11:18,497
All right, all right.
A little overdramatic. Sorry.

186
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,624
[Clears Throat]
Sorry, I'm just-

187
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,961
Ball's in the play box in the garage.

188
00:11:24,045 --> 00:11:27,215
Thank you. Thank you.

189
00:11:27,298 --> 00:11:30,426
- Talk to Metz.
- Sure.

190
00:11:31,219 --> 00:11:34,681
<i>So, um, listen, I was, uh- I was sorry
to hear about your old man.</i>

191
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:37,517
Mmm. Thank you.

192
00:11:37,601 --> 00:11:40,270
It was cancer, right?

193
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:43,482
Yeah. Uh, here.

194
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:45,150
Hmm. Of all places.

195
00:11:45,192 --> 00:11:49,488
- Ironic, right?
- Yeah. We got the iced teas coming?

196
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,490
- Mm-hmm, sure.
- Thank you.

197
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:54,535
Look, we've read your stuff,
Fred Roselle and I.

198
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:56,746
And I'm sorry to say,
it's just not there.

199
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,666
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>

200
00:11:59,707 --> 00:12:02,377
The consensus
was that it lacked personality.

201
00:12:03,628 --> 00:12:05,672
[Sighs]
Exactly.

202
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:11,345
I mean, Bing, last year, under Kirby,
I had 192 bylines.

203
00:12:11,386 --> 00:12:14,932
That's the most of any reporter
in the history of the newspaper.

204
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:17,351
You say my stuff is thin?
Of course it is.

205
00:12:17,393 --> 00:12:19,604
A lot of typing, no writing.
I don't have time.

206
00:12:19,687 --> 00:12:24,025
<i>And this year, I have a new editor.
So I keep an open mind.</i>

207
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:27,445
And guess what? He's working me
even harder than Kirby was.

208
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:31,199
<i>- I mean, he thinks I'm a machine.
- [Chuckles]</i>

209
00:12:31,241 --> 00:12:37,206
Anytime I bring in a story with just
an ounce of heart, Metz spikes it.

210
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,418
I mean, this is stuff that I think that
the magazine should have- magazine deserves.

211
00:12:41,502 --> 00:12:44,380
- Okay, give me an example.
- Well-

212
00:12:44,422 --> 00:12:47,091
- Is that the mango?
- Yeah.

213
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,552
<i>- It's not the peach?
- No, it's the mango.</i>

214
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:51,929
<i>Sorry. I'm sorry.
Give me an example.</i>

215
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,849
I mean, there's- I have so many.
But sometimes I feel blocked.

216
00:12:54,933 --> 00:12:58,144
- I'm not very good at this.
- No, no, no. Just anything.
Just give me an example.

217
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:02,983
Um, crossroads. Uh, Elway.

218
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:05,819
You know, what does he do now
at this point in his life?

219
00:13:05,903 --> 00:13:08,781
- Maybe he runs for governor.
- I get that one proposed and rejected
twice a week.

220
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:10,783
People don't want to hear
about their heroes aging.

221
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,119
Okay, okay.
Well, then what about Coors Field?

222
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:16,330
- The worst place to pitch-
- The worst place to pitch in America.

223
00:13:16,414 --> 00:13:20,710
[Chuckles]
Uh, strikin' out.

224
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:23,880
Um-

225
00:13:23,963 --> 00:13:29,261
Well, there's this boxer.
An ex-heavyweight contender.

226
00:13:29,302 --> 00:13:31,597
He's, uh, living on the streets of Denver.

227
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,767
- He's living in the trash.
- Yeah?

228
00:13:34,808 --> 00:13:37,937
Yeah. And, you know, he kind of patrols
the neighborhood. He calls himself the Champ.

229
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:41,524
<i>He's a- He's a lovely guy.</i>

230
00:13:41,607 --> 00:13:47,155
And the story, it's beautiful.
It's touching.

231
00:13:47,238 --> 00:13:49,657
But I tell Metz about it,
and he says, "Forget about it.

232
00:13:49,699 --> 00:13:52,202
It's a dry hole.
Go cover the Jermaine fight."

233
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,247
What's his name, the, uh- the boxer?

234
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,332
Satterfield.

235
00:13:59,751 --> 00:14:01,920
Bob Satterfield?

236
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:05,633
<i>- Yeah. Bob.
- Wow.</i>

237
00:14:05,674 --> 00:14:09,846
Are you sure? My dad used to idolize that guy.
I thought he was dead.

238
00:14:09,929 --> 00:14:12,765
- He- No, he's dead.
- That's what everybody thinks.

239
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:16,394
And that's why I think that this story
is such a great story.

240
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:19,439
I want to call it
"Resurrecting the Champ."

241
00:14:19,522 --> 00:14:22,818
- And he's here in Denver?
- Yeah.

242
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:25,654
- Bob Satterfield?
- I saw him yesterday.

243
00:14:27,322 --> 00:14:29,783
What are your plans for this?

244
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:31,952
Well, I thought maybe
I'd take my time.

245
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:36,374
You know, really work well on it,
work hard. Think quality.

246
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:39,168
And see if I can get Metz
to come around.

247
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:41,713
Well, if, uh-

248
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:46,593
If you can't bring him around,
I'd be glad to take a look at it.

249
00:14:46,676 --> 00:14:51,890
Well, that'd be great.
That'd be terrific.

250
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,184
<i>[Woman] When he won in California,
it was already too late.</i>

251
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,228
<i>Mondale had already
had enough delegates.</i>

252
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,480
<i>Um, no, I think so.</i>

253
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:01,859
Uh, November 30-
I don't have an exact date. I can find one.

254
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,903
- Hey.
- One second. Okay.

255
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,031
No, I'll get it for you and I'll-
Okay. Bye.

256
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,033
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it goin'?

257
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,953
- Great.
- Can you keep a secret, Molly?

258
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,663
- Can you?
- Sure.

259
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,123
- Can you?
- Sure.

260
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:17,626
My name's not Molly.

261
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:21,922
Yes, that's true.
'Cause it's Millie, right?

262
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,507
- Polly.
- Polly.

263
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:26,385
Close. Yeah.
What can I do for you?

264
00:15:26,469 --> 00:15:31,849
[Chuckles] Uh, well, I'm doing
a story on a heavyweight fighter...

265
00:15:31,933 --> 00:15:34,102
from the 1950s named Bob Satterfield.

266
00:15:34,185 --> 00:15:36,604
But, um, nobody can know about it.

267
00:15:36,688 --> 00:15:39,441
You're moonlighting.
It's none of Metz's business.

268
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:42,819
- You got it.
- Yeah.

269
00:15:42,903 --> 00:15:45,781
What do you need?

270
00:15:45,864 --> 00:15:48,909
Well, um, there wasn't much on him
on the Internet.

271
00:15:48,951 --> 00:15:52,538
So I guess you're gonna have to
go old school on this one.

272
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:55,458
I kind of need everything
you can find on him.

273
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:59,796
<i>From our library, New York Times,
L.A. Times, Ring magazine, of course.</i>

274
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:02,799
If you can find out if there's
a Boxing Hall of Fame, that'd be great.

275
00:16:02,882 --> 00:16:07,971
Anybody he may have fought.
Uh, trainers, anything.

276
00:16:08,054 --> 00:16:09,973
Shouldn't you write this down
or something?

277
00:16:10,056 --> 00:16:12,100
<i>- Plausible deniability.
- [Phone Rings]</i>

278
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,478
I've got to take that.

279
00:16:14,561 --> 00:16:17,314
- I will get the information
and bring it to your cubicle.
- Okay.

280
00:16:17,398 --> 00:16:20,025
Let's go. Drive it in.
Take it into the hoop.

281
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:23,529
I'm a big ol' slow guy. You can't take it
inside on me. You can't do it!

00:16:23,613 --> 00:16:25,948
- Foul!
- Foul?

283
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,534
Okay. Take some free throws then.

284
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:32,455
Aim for my hand, all right?
Front of the rim, my hand.

- Yeah.
- Well, he wasn't.

290
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,721
He told me so himself.

291
00:16:47,805 --> 00:16:50,808
He said that he was a big ol' spaz
when he was your age.

292
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:53,895
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

293
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:57,524
But he told me that in confidence, buddy.
So you can't tell anybody, okay?

<i>- Dad?
- Yes?</i>

Have you called up John Elway yet
and asked if he's playing next year?

296
00:17:04,322 --> 00:17:06,283
You know, we keep missing

Yeah, buddy. Some people do that.
They don't have a home.

They gotta sleep in the alley.

I'm gonna go find Satterfield.

a lot bigger than mine was at your age.

225
01:04:39,981 --> 01:04:42,234
It's important. Um-

226
01:04:42,318 --> 01:04:45,154
Do you have a... I.D.?

227
01:04:45,195 --> 01:04:48,991
Anything with your-
Driver's license, maybe?

228
01:04:49,074 --> 01:04:50,992
What do you need that for?

229
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:53,870
So that I can prove that you are
who you say you are.

230
01:04:53,954 --> 01:04:58,668

- [Both Laugh]

232
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:04,423
Yeah.

233
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:09,887
No, seriously though.
I just- I need something, uh...

234
01:05:09,971 --> 01:05:14,600
that I can prove
that you're Bob Satterfield with.

235
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:19,105
What did you say your name is again?

236
01:05:19,188 --> 01:05:21,106
Erik Kernan.

237
01:05:21,189 --> 01:05:24,277
- Can you prove that?
- Well, I have a driver's license

<i>- Well, who took that picture?

239
01:05:26,404 --> 01:05:29,949
And how did they know
you was who you said you was?

240
01:05:30,032 --> 01:05:33,202
Well, from my last driver's license

241
01:05:33,286 --> 01:05:35,705
Oh! And who took that picture?

242
01:05:37,707 --> 01:05:40,126
You see where I'm going with this?

243
01:05:40,209 --> 01:05:42,211
No, Champ.

244
01:05:42,295 --> 01:05:45,047
I don't- I just-

245
01:05:45,130 --> 01:05:47,175
I need- How about a passport?

246
01:05:47,258 --> 01:05:51,804
Do you have a passport?
Um, any- [Sighs]

247
01:05:51,887 --> 01:05:53,973

You, for one.

268
01:07:05,295 --> 01:07:07,213
It wouldn't hurt me
if nobody knew about it.

269
01:07:07,297 --> 01:07:09,508
Oh, is that an option,
that nobody will know about it?

270
01:07:09,591 --> 01:07:11,552
Joyce, let me ask you a question, okay?

271
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:15,472
How many newspapers print articles with
errors of fact in them every day in the U.S.?

272
01:07:15,556 --> 01:07:18,892
- [Chuckles]
- It's already done, Joyce.

273
01:07:18,976 --> 01:07:21,437
It's printed. It's out there.

274
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:23,897
Then print a retraction.

275
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:29,987
I can't just do that.
People have sent in money to Champ.

276
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:32,990
- Then give it back.
- I can't.

277
01:07:33,073 --> 01:07:35,201
I don't know
where half of it comes from.

278
01:07:39,163 --> 01:07:41,123
It's not just the money.

279
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:44,334
The Showtime job?

280
01:07:46,086 --> 01:07:49,673
Joyce, the point of the article
is still true.

281
01:07:49,757 --> 01:07:52,927
Okay, Erik. It's a lie.

282
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:57,014
I mean, if you profit by a lie,
then you're the same as a liar.

283
01:07:57,098 --> 01:07:59,142
<i>If you write a great story
but it's a lie...</i>

284
01:07:59,225 --> 01:08:01,727
<i>then you're just a liar
who writes great stories...</i>

285
01:08:01,810 --> 01:08:03,980
which is worse than an ordinary liar...

286
01:08:04,063 --> 01:08:07,024
because people who can write
ought to be better than your average liar.

287
01:08:07,066 --> 01:08:11,029
<i>So, you're a liar, and you let me down,
and you let everyone else...</i>

who works on this paper down
because you ought to be better than that.

289
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:15,909
Is that simple enough?

290
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:20,246
<i>- No, Joyce, that's not simple enough.
- Then let me put it another way.</i>

the first thing about boxing?

Does it look like I know the difference
between a hook and an uppercut...

or what a standing eight count is
or what a holding penalty is?
