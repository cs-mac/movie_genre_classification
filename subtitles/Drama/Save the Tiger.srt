<i>Captain Orin Smith stated:</i>

7
00:04:46,321 --> 00:04:48,755

14
00:05:09,711 --> 00:05:10,735

00:05:10,912 --> 00:05:12,971

<i>The APCD again cautions against</i>

20
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:34,857
<i>Now, let me show you something</i>

21

<i>Any dog will lick his chops</i>

22

- <i>Why, it'll make your dog sit up and</i>...
- Shit.

23
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:11,772
- You don't want any toast?
- <i>Nada,</i> nothing.

24
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,651
When's the funeral?

25
00:06:31,993 --> 00:06:33,255
Thursday.

26
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:36,423
Sorry about the airport thing.

27
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:40,123
Hard to believe Uncle Bernie's dead.
God, what a bastard.

28
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:43,435
Screwed everybody.
How long are you gonna be gone?

29
00:06:43,705 --> 00:06:45,332
A week, 10 days.

30
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,322
Do we have to?

31
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:16,735
You screamed in your sleep.
That's the second time this week.

32
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:17,860
Yeah.

33
00:07:19,974 --> 00:07:21,566
See Dr. Frankfurter.

34
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,870
He'd tell me it's repressed sex.

35
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,645
Maybe it is.

36
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:30,641
- It's Willie.
- Who?

37
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,818
Willie. The guy downtown
that parks my car is Willie.

38
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,263
- Kamu died.
- He died a long time ago.

39
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,831
No, not him. Kamu the whale.

40
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,300
Been swimming against the current
for three years.

41
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:53,838
- What current?
- And it damaged...

42
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:58,877
The current in the tank at Pacific World
and the friction damaged his dorsal fin.

43
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:04,980
It's a shame,
a beautiful animal like that dead.

44
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:08,019
I took Audrey to see him once
on her birthday, remember?

45
00:08:08,222 --> 00:08:10,019
I don't know how old she was,
10, 11 something...

46
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:12,317
Harry, you insulted Dr. Sorrel last night.

47
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,120
Insulted? What insult?

48
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:17,690
Drinking my booze
and climbing all over my wife.

49
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:20,026
- It's insecurity. He's insecure.
- Insecure.

50
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:21,963
He's got everything up front
except trumpets.

51
00:08:22,136 --> 00:08:25,401
He happens to be a very fine doctor.
A lot of people are using him.

52
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:27,838
A lot of people are using him.
I still like Doc Fisher.

53
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,670
Fisher still uses leeches. He's an old man.

54
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:34,974
Yeah, old and smart. He can diagnose
hemorrhoids through a suit of armor.

55
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,483
Those things look worse than ever.

56
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,623
Wouldn't hurt to have them checked again.

57
00:08:43,791 --> 00:08:46,089
Yeah. That nine year old kid, Judy Miller...

58
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,195
they're gonna let her play baseball
with the boys. How'd you like that.

59
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,697
Father had to go to court but they're
gonna let her play, I think it's terrific.

60
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:54,028
Who the hell notices at that age?

61
00:08:54,168 --> 00:08:56,864
If the kid's a good ball player,
what's the difference if she's a girl?

62
00:08:57,004 --> 00:08:59,666
Father must be a hell of a guy,
he took it all the way to court, huh?

63
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:03,436
You used to love baseball. Why don't
you go to a game once in a while?

64
00:09:04,245 --> 00:09:08,238
They play but they don't play
on dirt anymore, they play on plastic.

65
00:09:08,783 --> 00:09:11,274
Ballplayers are a bunch of antiseptic kids.

66
00:09:12,019 --> 00:09:13,680
They don't chew tobacco.

67
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,689
Don't use their spikes. In the old days
they'd slide in high, man...

68
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,520
those spikes'd take your face right off.

69
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,424
The pitchers don't wind up any more.
My God, they used to wind up.

70
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:24,690
Johnny Vander Meer, remember that
crazy mad Dutchman?

71
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:27,027
Oh, my God, was that pitching!

72
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:31,161
Course he was a southpaw. Casey!

73
00:09:32,974 --> 00:09:37,843
Jesus, Hugh Casey. Lumbering out from
that bullpen, chewing on his tobacco.

74
00:09:38,446 --> 00:09:39,538
Cool.

75
00:09:40,214 --> 00:09:42,375
He'd get out there under pressure...

76
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,477
he'd throw a sinker
that would just fall right off a cliff.

77
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,953
Ran out of his stuff, he'd throw
his balls up to the plate.

78
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,990
God damn, they were something!

79
00:09:53,194 --> 00:09:54,957
They were really something.

80
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,387
Harry?

81
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:03,103
What?

82
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:05,367
See Dr. Frankfurter.

83
00:10:06,474 --> 00:10:09,238
Frankfurter couldn't throw a strike
from two feet.

84
00:10:09,377 --> 00:10:12,869
- Hypnosis, hypnosis is the thing.
- Bullshit.

85
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,986
They can tell a lot from dreams.

86
00:10:31,966 --> 00:10:34,833
- You're worried.
- Cuban Pete never worries.

87
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:37,160
- You're worried.
- I don't know why.

88
00:10:37,338 --> 00:10:39,932
It only costs me $200
a day to get out of bed.

89
00:10:40,074 --> 00:10:42,372
- $200 a day?
- That's what the accountant tells me...

90
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:46,274
with everything, $200 a day.
There's the taxes, insurance...

91
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:51,112
automobiles and a gardener
and a pool man...

92
00:10:51,252 --> 00:10:53,550
and a tree surgeon, for Christ's sake.

93
00:10:54,455 --> 00:10:58,482
And Carmela, and house payments
and a Swiss school...

94
00:10:59,393 --> 00:11:00,724
$200 a day.

95
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:05,162
And downtown, that's another story.

96
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,029
Got to finance the new line
and money's tight.

97
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,764
Textile mills to pay, payroll to meet.

98
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:16,171
And we may be audited.

99
00:11:18,546 --> 00:11:22,915
- Audited for what?
- Last year, we...

100
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:26,612
did a little ballet with the books.

101
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:30,484
- What does Phil say?
- He's worried.

102
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:33,960
He's always worried.

103
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,298
Listen, when you get back from New York...

104
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:43,395
why don't we fly over to Geneva
and see the kid?

105
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:48,167
Harry, she's better off over there.
Europe is civilized.

106
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:50,740
Things are too crazy in this country.

107
00:11:51,946 --> 00:11:53,880
A man came out of Mario's Restaurant...

108
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:56,016
someone walked up and shot him to death.

109
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,313
They didn't even know each other.
That's just a few blocks away.

110
00:11:59,453 --> 00:12:03,219
Maybe we could get a brigade of
Cambodians to patrol Beverly Hills.

111
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,552
Mexican maids could cook their rice.

112
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:10,252
- She's better off in Switzerland.
- I miss her, I miss the kid.

113
00:12:14,168 --> 00:12:16,329
Keep hearing that song from <i>Babar...</i>

114
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,234
<i>The Elephant's Song.</i>

115
00:12:19,407 --> 00:12:23,503
Harry, they are shooting horse
in the toilets at the high school!

116
00:12:26,714 --> 00:12:29,410
Cuban Pete's daughter doesn't shoot horse.

117
00:12:46,734 --> 00:12:50,431
It's funny, every time one of us leaves,
I wish we'd made it.

118
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:52,129
I'm not going to Mars.

119
00:12:52,707 --> 00:12:55,676
Yeah, I know that but you know,
all these hijackings.

120
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:58,606
Those monster jets, I don't know how
the hell they get up and down.

121
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:00,747
In the old days you could see
the propellers spinning...

122
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,576
out there on the wings,
you knew what kept it up.

123
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,150
That's a happy thought.
I really need that before I...

124
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,846
I just meant that I wish
we'd made it last night.

125
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:11,321
You left me with the company. By the
time I got to bed you were out cold.

126
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:13,154
We still should've.

127
00:13:13,527 --> 00:13:17,019
You could've woke me up,
what would I have missed? A nightmare.

128
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:22,065
Every time one of us goes to the airport
you start getting romantic.

129
00:13:23,571 --> 00:13:25,903
Promise me you'll see Dr. Frankfurter.

130
00:13:27,475 --> 00:13:28,567
Harry?

131
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:33,109
- I'm serious about Frankfurter.
- Yeah.

132
00:13:37,718 --> 00:13:39,709
I should've been a ballplayer.

133
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:43,088
With my arm, I could've made Brooklyn.

134
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:46,017
Chicago, anyway.

135
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,090
First base: Dolph Camilli.

136
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,373
Second base: Pete Coscarart.

137
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:08,740
Durocher at short, Cookie Lavagetto at third.

138
00:14:10,985 --> 00:14:13,453
God, that was something, really something.

139
00:14:26,734 --> 00:14:28,702
<i>... Soviet poet has been re-committed...</i>

140
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:30,632
<i>to the state mental institution in Leningrad</i>...

141
00:14:30,771 --> 00:14:32,864
<i>Children learning American history...</i>

142
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,272
<i>only a few feet from a mortuary.</i>
<i>Strange? Perhaps.</i>

143
00:14:38,012 --> 00:14:41,812
<i>But Pleasant Heaven believes</i>
<i>in life as well as death.</i>

144
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,144
<i>Take your...</i>

145
00:15:17,351 --> 00:15:18,443
Oh, yeah.

146
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:45,004
Come on.

147
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:53,579
- Thanks a lot, mister.
- Okay.

148
00:15:56,457 --> 00:15:59,051
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

149
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:00,817
What does that mean?

150
00:16:00,961 --> 00:16:03,657
I stay on the Strip. I ride back and forth.

151
00:16:04,832 --> 00:16:07,630
- All day?
- All day.

152
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:11,268
I didn't know people still did that.

153
00:16:11,772 --> 00:16:14,400
Well, I'm just an old-fashioned girl.

154
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,376
- How old are you?
- Twenty.

155
00:16:22,082 --> 00:16:23,413
Nobody's 20.

156
00:16:26,921 --> 00:16:29,981
- I get off at Crescent Heights, all right?
- Yeah, it's okay, wherever.

157
00:16:30,124 --> 00:16:31,148
Right.

158
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,956
- Sounds like an old recording.
- It is.

159
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:43,631
- How old are you?
- 33.

160
00:16:48,976 --> 00:16:52,468
- That's a groovy suit.
- Thank you.

161
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,547
You want to ball?

162
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:04,353
It's awfully nice of you to offer...

163
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:08,825
- but I'm running a little behind schedule.
- Okay.

164
00:17:36,657 --> 00:17:38,750
Sure you don't wanna ball?

165
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,788
I'm afraid I'll have to pass,
but thank you very much.

166
00:17:42,963 --> 00:17:44,396
- Thank you.
- Okay.

167
00:17:45,099 --> 00:17:48,364
- My name is Myra, I'm here all the time.
- Go ahead, Myra.

168
00:17:49,103 --> 00:17:51,264
- Bye.
- Bye bye. Have a nice day.

169
00:17:52,139 --> 00:17:54,869
- Nice day?
- Yeah, you know...

170
00:17:55,309 --> 00:17:59,370
rapping with your friends
or whatever you... Have a nice day.

171
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:02,639
- Okay, I will.
- Bye.

172
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:05,780
- Bye.
- Bye.

173
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,535
- Hi ya, Willie.
- What time you going out?

174
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:33,680
- That's hard to say.
- Hard to say?

175
00:18:33,814 --> 00:18:37,648
Well, I wouldn't want to make it hard
for you, no, nothing like that.

176
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,317
Hello, Al.

177
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:23,854
What?

178
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,602
Yeah, okay. Either slow down
or speak American, Al.

179
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:32,136
- My name is not Al, it's Alfonso.
- Alfonso.

180
00:19:32,306 --> 00:19:35,537
Listen, I got 16 illegal wetbacks
working here, have I ever said a word?

181
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,906
- You're a real <i>revolucionario,</i> Harry.
- Yeah, thank you.

182
00:19:38,045 --> 00:19:39,637
Listen, how're we doing?
Are you gonna make it?

183
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,078
I'll have everything at the hotel by 1:00.
You're not worried about me, <i>señor?</i>

184
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,118
- Never worry about you, Al.
- <i>Los otros,</i> Meyer and Rico.

185
00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:56,896
Hello, love.

186
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:01,898
- Hi, Rosanna.
- It's a super collection, Mr. Stoner.

187
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,900
- I just hope it sells.
- It will, it will.

188
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,005
"It will, it will." It better.

189
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:14,840
Damn the costs! The plaid must match.

190
00:20:15,015 --> 00:20:18,143
- You're losing the grain on the jerseys!
- Listen to me, you pansy!

191
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,946
I was making patterns
before you sucked milk!

192
00:20:21,088 --> 00:20:22,180
You get your hands off me!

193
00:20:22,356 --> 00:20:24,916
I will not have my designs
butchered by a no-talent Cossack!

194
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,891
- All right, that's enough!
- Enough, yeah, that's right.

195
00:20:28,028 --> 00:20:29,723
- I'm through, Harry.
- Good!

196
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:31,555
I can go across the street to Beckman.

197
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,598
- I know Beckman...
- I don't need this aggravation...

198
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,894
after 50 years in the business
from a fresh pansy!

199
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:37,731
- You God damn peasant!
- Please.

200
00:20:37,871 --> 00:20:39,463
You can be replaced by a laser beam!

201
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,437
- Meyer, why do you do this to me?
- To you?

202
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,439
Who can do anything to you?
You're a playback.

203
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:45,202
You tell everyone what they want to hear.

204
00:20:45,345 --> 00:20:48,041
We can't stand here and have
a philosophical discussion. Not today.

205
00:20:48,182 --> 00:20:50,047
The show is this afternoon. Everything's...

206
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:52,152
- Harry, we must talk!
- We will talk later!

207
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:52,743
- Harry, we must talk!
- We will talk later!

208
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,184
Look at your fingers. Orange.

209
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,554
So they're orange. 50 years I'm smoking.

210
00:20:58,759 --> 00:21:00,488
And if I die you know what they'll do?

211
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,118
They'll bury me because if they don't,
I'll stink.

212
00:21:03,297 --> 00:21:04,730
- Meyer.
- Harry.

213
00:21:07,134 --> 00:21:11,264
- I want to talk to you.
- Meyer, we will talk. But later.

214
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,197
All right? Later, I promise you.

215
00:21:37,564 --> 00:21:40,089
- You all right, Rico?
- Me? I'm fine. I'm super.

216
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:42,327
It's that God damn Russian,
he's ruining my designs.

217
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,936
He's the finest cutter in this business.

218
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:47,666
You know, you ought to take
a long look at it before it's gone.

219
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:49,968
- What are you talking about?
- Craft.

220
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:51,944
The kind that old man has.

221
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,944
- Stunning, isn't it?
- Yeah.

222
00:21:54,214 --> 00:21:55,806
Thanks, dear. Gorgeous.

223
00:21:56,817 --> 00:22:00,048
You know, Harry, I'm getting very bored
with all this nonsense.

224
00:22:00,187 --> 00:22:01,085
Yeah?

225
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:05,655
Yeah. You're gonna have to make a
choice. Because I cannot be restricted.

226
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,384
Rico, we do have a contract.

227
00:22:07,561 --> 00:22:09,358
You just try to get a design
out of a contract!

228
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,498
Don't you get cute with me, Rico,
it's the wrong day.

229
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:14,156
My God, you've got a short memory!

230
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,632
Have you forgotten? I knew you
when your name was Sol.

231
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:19,796
You were running packages and going
to a drawing school. Don't interrupt me!

232
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:21,463
Who paid for that drawing school, Rico?

233
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:24,236
Who took you by the hand,
led you across this country?

234
00:22:24,378 --> 00:22:27,108
Who introduced you to his friends,
the buyers, and they showed you...

235
00:22:27,247 --> 00:22:30,307
all about the minis, the midis, the maxis
and the fabrics, silks, satins...

236
00:22:30,484 --> 00:22:32,042
- But I delivered, didn't I?
- Delivered?

237
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,483
- Half your creations are copies!
- Everybody copies!

238
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:38,284
You're right. So don't come on
like a half-assed genius.

239
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:43,588
- Harry, we're gonna have to have a talk.
- Not today we don't. Tomorrow.

240
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,365
You know something?

241
00:22:48,235 --> 00:22:52,501
I used to like Solly. He was a good kid.
I wonder what ever happened to him.

242
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,408
Put a belt on that stunning jacket.

243
00:23:11,925 --> 00:23:13,119
- Good morning, Mr. Stoner.
- Hi ya.

244
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:14,260
- Here's your mail.
- What?

245
00:23:14,428 --> 00:23:16,453
Gloria's out sick today.

246
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,822
- My, that's a beautiful suit.
- Passatti, Italian silk.

247
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:22,526
- Mr. Greene's been asking for you.
- Yeah.

248
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:27,630
- Hi, Mr. Stoner.
- Hi, honey.

249
00:23:27,808 --> 00:23:30,299
- Nice-looking suit.
- Passatti, Italian silk.

250
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:36,683
I told you I can't meet a 30 day note.

251
00:23:37,951 --> 00:23:40,351
Well, we've been doing business
with you for 15 years...

252
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,488
and maybe that's been a mistake.

253
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,487
All right, what do you want?

254
00:23:45,826 --> 00:23:50,354
You wanna foreclose?
Okay, I'll see you in court in five years.

255
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:54,999
Yes, right. All right, Sam.

256
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:02,198
Good afternoon.
Where the hell have you been?

257
00:24:02,376 --> 00:24:04,810
- What happened at the bank?
- What the hell do you think happened?

258
00:24:04,978 --> 00:24:06,502
Just like I told you.

259
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:10,205
- The best is 50 cents on every dollar.
- Not enough.

260
00:24:10,384 --> 00:24:12,682
- What?
- Not enough.

261
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:16,445
It's a God damn shame.
We've got a hell of a line.

262
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,315
Rico did a brilliant job.

263
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:22,590
I went over all the patterns
with the old man.

264
00:24:22,729 --> 00:24:27,132
Everything figures: Materials, labor,
fittings, accessories, packaging...

265
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:30,462
shipping, sales commissions,
everything, it's all there.

266
00:24:34,708 --> 00:24:38,109
If the country doesn't go in the crapper,
we'll have a great season.

267
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:42,008
- We'll make some money for a change.
- How many dollars do we need?

268
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,374
Dollars!

269
00:24:51,258 --> 00:24:55,024
If you can write $300,000 this afternoon...

270
00:24:55,162 --> 00:24:57,392
- Christ, I'll write $300,000...
- All right, if you can write...

271
00:24:57,564 --> 00:25:01,330
$300,000 this afternoon, discounted
at the bank, we get $150,000.

272
00:25:01,501 --> 00:25:04,436
- And?
- We'll need another $142,000...

273
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,436
in less than 60 days.

274
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:10,567
The mills are on our back; we owe them
a bundle from last year.

275
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,974
All right, what about
the Long Beach factory?

276
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:15,944
- What about it?
- What are we using that for?

277
00:25:16,116 --> 00:25:19,882
I don't know. We're turning out
three numbers down there. Pantsuits.

278
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,917
- Policies all paid up?
- Of course they are.

279
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,182
Okay.

280
00:25:34,234 --> 00:25:35,531
What the hell is that?

281
00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:38,466
Charlie Robbins. What's the policy worth?

282
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:40,038
Charlie Robbins?

283
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,869
- What's the policy worth?
- Forget it, Harry!

284
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:45,836
We can ask the unions,
the mills to carry us.

285
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:47,673
After all these years, those bastards owe us!

286
00:25:47,848 --> 00:25:49,782
We tried that last year
and they told us to take a walk.

287
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,178
How much is the floater worth?

288
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:54,184
I'm not gonna get involved with Robbins.
There's a line I will not cross!

289
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:58,120
God damn it, one simple question:
How much is the floater worth?

290
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:00,418
- Forget the fucking floater.
- Do I have to go ask Marvin?

291
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,494
Now how much is it worth, Phil?

292
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,834
- $100,000.
- That's enough to squeeze through.

293
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:12,268
We cut a lot of sharp corners together
but this is insanity!

294
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,532
You must be kidding.
Christ, if we were flat on our ass...

295
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:17,108
and we made missiles, Congress
would send us a certified check.

296
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:18,939
- We happen to make dresses.
- That's bullshit.

297
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,479
You can't rationalize a thing like this.
I won't permit it, I...

298
00:26:21,648 --> 00:26:25,414
Phil! Charlie Robbins is the very best.
There's never gonna be any questions.

299
00:26:25,552 --> 00:26:27,986
Will you wake up?
There are always questions!

300
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:30,122
How the hell do you think
that Beckman pulled out?

301
00:26:30,323 --> 00:26:32,553
Now, do you think his fire
was spontaneous combustion?

302
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:34,387
I don't give a good God damn
about Beckman!

303
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:36,962
I give a good God damn!
We almost went on our ass last year...

304
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:39,564
and this is our only chance to bail out!

305
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:42,927
- Then we'll file for bankruptcy.
- We file for bankruptcy, we get audited.

306
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:45,571
Would you like Linda to visit you in Chino?

307
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,070
Arson, Harry, arson!

308
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:51,005
This is a major felony.
You're talking about 20 years.

309
00:26:51,144 --> 00:26:54,113
Look, arson or fraud,
it is the same accommodations.

310
00:26:56,917 --> 00:26:58,578
It's out of the question.

311
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:03,749
I won't do it. I am not gonna get involved
with Robbins and that's it!

312
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:40,525
Son of a bitch.

313
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:45,694
Think I enjoy doing this, Phil?

314
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:49,768
What the hell else am I gonna do?
Just tell me.

315
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:53,430
We invented a new kind
of arithmetic last year.

316
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:58,068
But we survived.
We kept our people working.

317
00:27:58,812 --> 00:28:03,681
Seventy-one girls, 14 salesmen,
secretaries, all making a living.

318
00:28:03,817 --> 00:28:04,784
Phil.

319
00:28:05,819 --> 00:28:09,311
The government has another word
for survival and it's called fraud.

320
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:10,989
You, me, fraud!

321
00:28:13,593 --> 00:28:16,994
Christ, you haven't been out
on that street for 38 years.

322
00:28:17,697 --> 00:28:19,995
You wanna start looking for a job now?

323
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,162
Well, neither do I.

324
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,339
<i>Hello?</i>

325
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:40,918
Get Charlie Robbins, please.
Harry Stoner is calling.

326
00:28:41,087 --> 00:28:42,850
<i>Sorry, he's sleeping.</i>

327
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:46,049
- Would you wake him up? It's important.
- <i>Just a moment.</i>

328
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:53,866
<i>Hello?</i>

329
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,830
Charlie, Harry. I'm sorry to wake you up.

330
00:28:55,969 --> 00:28:58,437
<i>That's okay, Harry.</i>
<i>You played Fairview lately?</i>

331
00:28:58,605 --> 00:29:01,301
No. As a matter of fact I haven't played
since we played last week.

332
00:29:01,508 --> 00:29:02,736
- <i>Played yesterday.</i>
- Really?

333
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,240
- <i>Shot a 68.</i>
- On that course?

334
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:07,244
Sixty-eight, that's marvelous.
Putting like a demon?

335
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,541
<i>Some days everything's on the green.</i>

336
00:29:09,716 --> 00:29:12,583
Listen, Charlie, you remember
that last week I mentioned...

337
00:29:12,719 --> 00:29:15,586
that we had this plumbing problem
in one of our factories?

338
00:29:15,755 --> 00:29:18,553
<i>Yes, I recall you mentioning</i>
<i>something like that.</i>

339
00:29:18,692 --> 00:29:21,559
The God damn water's all over
the place and has to be fixed right away.

340
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:25,324
<i>I see. How about this afternoon? Say 3:30?</i>

341
00:29:25,498 --> 00:29:28,399
That's a little early.
Could you make it about 4:30?

342
00:29:28,568 --> 00:29:30,001
<i>I'll move something around.</i>

343
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,106
<i>We'll meet at the Mayan Theatre</i>
<i>on Hill Street. Right side of the balcony.</i>

344
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:36,538
- Right.
- <i>Details as discussed, Harry.</i>

345
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:38,610
- Fine. Okay.
- <i>See you at the movies.</i>

346
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,645
- Gotcha, Charlie.
- <i>Bye, Harry.</i>

347
00:29:58,064 --> 00:30:01,363
4:30 this afternoon
at the Mayan Theatre on Hill Street.

348
00:30:02,302 --> 00:30:04,236
Right hand side of the balcony.

349
00:30:14,514 --> 00:30:15,481
He...

350
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:21,753
gets a $2,500 retainer and 15%
of the final settlement.

351
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,045
Draw the cash and put it in an envelope...

352
00:30:24,257 --> 00:30:25,349
with the key to the Long Beach factory.

353
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:26,547
With the key to the Long Beach factory.

354
00:30:31,264 --> 00:30:32,959
- What do you want?
- <i>Fred Mirrell is here.</i>

355
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:34,657
- God!
- Freddy Mirrell?

356
00:30:34,868 --> 00:30:37,496
- Tell Gloria to bring him into my office.
- <i>Gloria's out sick today.</i>

357
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:39,296
- What is he doing here?
- Leave the switchboard.

358
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:41,303
- Get him in, bring him into my office.
- <i>All right.</i>

359
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:44,170
What's Freddy doing here? He knows
the show's at 3:00 at the hotel.

360
00:30:44,377 --> 00:30:46,311
- He wants to get laid.
- Here?

361
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,105
Yeah, right on your desk!

362
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,778
I wonder what would happen
if once, just once...

363
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:55,181
you sold the son of a bitch the line
on its merits.

364
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:58,518
We'd lose the account! Get Margo
on the phone and set it up for Freddy.

365
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,454
Have we still got the same suite
at the Belgrave?

366
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:03,185
Yes. The show, the girls, all under
the same roof. The whole mess.

367
00:31:03,396 --> 00:31:06,160
- It's business, Phil! Give me the key!
- Business?

368
00:31:06,566 --> 00:31:07,931
Business for what?

369
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:09,435
To become a pimp?
To commit a major felony?

370
00:31:09,435 --> 00:31:09,992
To become a pimp?
To commit a major felony?

371
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:13,969
So you can go fishing. Now get Margo
on the phone and fix it up for 1:30.

372
00:31:14,174 --> 00:31:17,507
Freddy, baby, how the hell are you,
fella? How was the trip?

373
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,770
Good to see you.
My, by damn, you look good.

374
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,278
What is it here? A little weight,
you're losing a little weight.

375
00:31:23,483 --> 00:31:26,179
I haven't been feeling too well.
The doctor tells me high cholesterol.

376
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,377
That's a national disease.
Sit down, I'll get you a drink.

377
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:30,113
- Thanks. A little scotch on the rocks.
- Okay.

378
00:31:30,323 --> 00:31:33,258
- I got the scotch, I haven't got the rocks.
- Any way at all, Harry.

379
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:36,860
Hey, Fred, I gotta tell you.
We have a terrific line this year.

380
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:40,159
Shoot, you don't have to sell me.
I'm here to buy. That's what I'm here for.

381
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,857
No, I really mean it.
You want a little water?

382
00:31:42,035 --> 00:31:43,502
- Yeah, please.
- No, I mean it.

383
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:45,831
I think it's the finest line
that we've ever had, Fred.

384
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,404
As a matter of fact it's so good...

385
00:31:47,607 --> 00:31:50,804
that I been thinking
about giving a bonus to our designer.

386
00:31:50,977 --> 00:31:53,639
- She says she can't do it.
- She's got to do it!

387
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:55,676
- What, Fred?
- I said I took the train.

388
00:31:55,882 --> 00:31:59,113
I didn't know the trains still ran
from Cleveland.

389
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:01,747
Well, you have to change in Chicago.

390
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:03,616
Here you go, old boy.
Would you like a cigar?

391
00:32:03,823 --> 00:32:05,791
- I'd love to but no, thank you.
- Okay.

392
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:06,959
- Cheers, Harry.
- Cheers.

393
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,651
- Good luck this afternoon.
- Thanks, baby; good to see you.

394
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:12,992
I can't fly anymore. How do you like that?

395
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:16,135
- No shit?
- That train ride, Jesus Christ...

396
00:32:16,636 --> 00:32:20,003
I mean, I've been sitting
in that compartment for 39 hours...

397
00:32:20,173 --> 00:32:24,701
eating that God damn food. Boy,
I'm tense, I'm really on edge, I tell you.

398
00:32:24,911 --> 00:32:28,677
Yeah, I'm a little nervous myself. I gotta
write a lot of business this afternoon.

399
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,611
I'm sure the line is solid.

400
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:34,781
Say, look, how about that, Fred?

401
00:32:34,954 --> 00:32:36,751
Why don't you just give me
an open end order...

402
00:32:36,923 --> 00:32:39,756
and I'll fill it personally and then
you won't have to come to the show?

403
00:32:39,893 --> 00:32:41,986
I told you I just got off a train.

404
00:32:43,563 --> 00:32:47,055
I don't know, I can't think
about business. I gotta relax.

405
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:49,225
All right.

406
00:32:53,773 --> 00:32:55,263
Say, Harry...

407
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,943
is that girl still around?

408
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,342
What girl?

409
00:33:03,116 --> 00:33:07,177
That... What's her name? Margo.

410
00:33:08,721 --> 00:33:10,951
Come on, you remember, from last year.

411
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:17,720
Oh, Margo! Yeah. Well, I guess
she's still at the old stand.

412
00:33:18,031 --> 00:33:20,761
Harry, I mean, Christ!

413
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:25,930
She's really sensational,
I mean, that girl, Harry, is a magician.

414
00:33:26,439 --> 00:33:28,202
Come on, what're we jerking
each other off for?

415
00:33:28,341 --> 00:33:30,036
Get her on the phone, set it up.

416
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:33,407
Me call Margo today?
With all of the buyers in town?

417
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,275
- There's not a chance.
- Wait a minute. Hold on.

418
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,810
What're you giving me this shit for?

419
00:33:39,118 --> 00:33:41,848
This is me, Freddy Mirrell, remember?

420
00:33:42,622 --> 00:33:47,218
Why, we do $80,000 a year, the past
six years that's almost half a million.

421
00:33:47,727 --> 00:33:49,695
Harry, have I ever asked you
for a Christmas card?

422
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,023
No, Fred, you've always been
perfectly straight.

423
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:53,187
You're God damn right.

424
00:33:53,366 --> 00:33:56,096
That's the way I play the game,
everybody knows that.

425
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,328
I'm just trying to tell you it's not that easy.

426
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:02,270
That's a very popular lady.
Why didn't you call me from Cleveland?

427
00:34:02,675 --> 00:34:05,610
Harry, I don't make calls like that
from Cleveland.

428
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:13,048
Harry, I don't want to argue with you.

429
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:18,220
You and me,
we go back a hell of a long ways.

430
00:34:19,759 --> 00:34:23,058
I spent 5,362 nights...

431
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:28,963
with a sick woman. Wait a minute.

432
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:34,363
Don't misunderstand me, Harry, I...
Edna's no bitch.

433
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:38,809
You know Edna, she's a good wife.
She's a hell of a cook, Harry.

434
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,078
It's just, well...

435
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:44,808
it's all those God damn operations.

436
00:34:45,852 --> 00:34:48,082
The woman is all scarred up, Harry.

437
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:52,885
Now after 15 years,
I need these little diversions.

438
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,950
You know what I mean?

439
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:59,131
Yeah, I know what you mean.

440
00:35:01,768 --> 00:35:04,862
Say, it's only 11:30.

441
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:08,098
Come on, Harry, call the girl.

442
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:13,411
I'll try. I mean, for you...

443
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:17,775
I'll try but like I said,
it's not easy, you know and...

444
00:35:18,818 --> 00:35:21,446
God, she's gonna have
to break appointments...

445
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,088
you're talking about a lot of money.

446
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:25,383
Why, you rotten son of a bitch.

447
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:29,461
Harry, I just threw my heart
across your desk.

448
00:35:30,196 --> 00:35:31,925
And you're giving me cost?

449
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:35,064
The whole God damn thing is a write off!

450
00:35:35,435 --> 00:35:37,733
The government pays for the goose!
You know that!

451
00:35:37,904 --> 00:35:39,997
- Fred, take it easy.
- Hello, Fred.

452
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:45,205
- Glad to see you again. How are you?
- Fine, Phil, thank you.

453
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:48,575
That matter in Chicago,
you'll have to handle it yourself.

454
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:50,207
Okay.

455
00:35:51,451 --> 00:35:52,645
Fred.

456
00:35:53,286 --> 00:35:57,382
A little problem came up. How about...
Phil, take Fred through the factory.

457
00:35:57,557 --> 00:36:00,117
- He'll give you a preview of the new line.
- I'll show you around.

458
00:36:00,259 --> 00:36:02,853
I'll see if I can get that design
that you're interested in.

459
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:04,792
- Okay, Harry.
- How's Edna?

460
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:08,498
Good, Phil, good. She's out of the hospital.

461
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,192
Thank God. Glad to hear that.

462
00:36:10,336 --> 00:36:12,930
Yeah, we were all a little worried about her.

463
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:05,748
Margo, it's Harry Stoner. How are you, love?

464
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:09,020
<i>Forget it, Harry, I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Like I told Phil, I'm booked.</i>

465
00:37:09,195 --> 00:37:12,096
Baby, you have got to get
un-booked, 'cause this is vital.

466
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,825
<i>I understand all that but it's the last minute.</i>

467
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:17,299
<i>You know all the buyers are in town.</i>
<i>Who is it anyway?</i>

468
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,598
An old buddy. Fred. You know, Fred Mirrell?

469
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,605
I think he's in love with you.

470
00:37:22,775 --> 00:37:25,608
<i>That freak!</i>
<i>He'll want Dusty and me to do the act.</i>

471
00:37:26,312 --> 00:37:30,510
<i>The olive oil, camphor ice, vibrator,</i>
<i>finger paints...</i>

472
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:32,412
<i>you know, the whole God damn megilla.</i>

473
00:37:32,585 --> 00:37:35,418
No, you got the wrong guy.
That's Jackson from Pittsburgh.

474
00:37:35,588 --> 00:37:37,681
No, Fred is... Come in.
Fred's a straight ahead fella.

475
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:40,257
Hang on, honey. Yeah, that's fine.
I'll talk to you later.

476
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,360
- That's just terrific.
- <i>I don't have the wrong guy.</i>

477
00:37:42,495 --> 00:37:46,192
Listen, love, believe me, you have
got Fred confused with Jackson.

478
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:49,965
Look, honey, I need this favor.

479
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:52,302
Margo, they're in a wringer.

480
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:05,913
- And if you want to tell me...
- No, it's not bad.

481
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:08,576
Look at the back; it's not too high,
it hangs on the back...

482
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,985
- Fred, you have an appointment.
- It's very nice, Rico, thank you.

483
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:16,356
- I might see you later, dear.
- 1:30, my boy.

484
00:38:16,996 --> 00:38:18,020
You're beautiful!

485
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:20,632
Your friend is in Room 9227
at the Belgrave.

486
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,633
- It's really gorgeous, Harry!
- Any problems, we'll be down in the bar.

487
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,569
It's so gorgeous, Harry.
Beautiful. I hate to put you in a spot.

488
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:31,437
- How could you put us in a spot?
- I hate to be a pain in the ass.

489
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,943
I know the pressure
you boys are under, Jesus.

490
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,274
- No.
- I hate to be a pain in the ass.

491
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,939
Now go on, enjoy yourself.
You're only young once.

492
00:38:38,084 --> 00:38:39,847
Thank you, boys.

493
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,918
The top buyer of one of the most
reputable stores in the country...

494
00:38:45,057 --> 00:38:47,150
- and he's a pervert.
- That's Jackson from Pittsburgh.

495
00:38:48,294 --> 00:38:50,455
Thank God for Margo, she's a real pro.

496
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:53,622
Yes, we're rich with professionals:
Margo and Charlie.

497
00:38:53,799 --> 00:38:56,029
One starts the fires,
the other one puts them out.

498
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:57,567
All right, let's go to lunch.

499
00:38:57,737 --> 00:38:58,066
All right, let's go to lunch.

500
00:38:59,372 --> 00:39:01,033
- I'm going to the can.
- I'll meet you at the elevator.

501
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:02,299
Would you call a cab?

502
00:39:02,408 --> 00:39:04,376
We're gonna go to lunch
and then go to the hotel.

503
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:07,512
- Any calls for me?
- Your wife called. Excuse me.

504
00:39:07,947 --> 00:39:09,346
Capri Casuals.

505
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:14,475
Who's calling, please? One moment, please.

506
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,818
It's Mr. Norris.

507
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:23,586
I'm sorry; he's gone to lunch.
Can he call you back? Thank you.

508
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:27,124
- My wife?
- Your wife called from the airport.

509
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:29,564
She'll call you tonight from New York.

510
00:39:29,702 --> 00:39:32,364
She said not to forget
to take your Vitamin E.

511
00:39:32,605 --> 00:39:33,765
Thanks, Ida.

512
00:39:53,059 --> 00:39:56,722
Second base: Pete Coscarart.

513
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:05,166
Durocher at short. Cookie Lavagetto at third.

514
00:40:07,006 --> 00:40:10,442
Catcher: Babe Phelps.

515
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:15,471
Maybe it was Mickey Owen?

516
00:40:21,821 --> 00:40:23,812
Pitcher: Lou Camilli.

517
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:26,514
"Hot Potato" Hamlin.

518
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:30,856
Vito Tamulis.

519
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:35,563
Take an hour for that change of pace
to get up to the plate, man...

520
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:40,872
Flutterball.

521
00:41:18,744 --> 00:41:20,871
How about a little Chinese for a change?

522
00:41:21,046 --> 00:41:23,537
- I feel like pastrami.
- Pastrami? That stuff will kill you.

523
00:41:23,716 --> 00:41:25,308
They fly it all the way in from New York.

524
00:41:25,451 --> 00:41:27,646
Let's go down to the Hong Kong
and we'll have the $3 special.

525
00:41:27,787 --> 00:41:29,618
- Sweet and Sour Pork.
- I feel like pastrami.

526
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:32,656
Come on, Phil. That place
is a madhouse, that delicatessen.

527
00:41:32,825 --> 00:41:35,851
I'll take you down to the Hong Kong,
and we'll have a nice quiet lunch. Yeah.

528
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:39,555
- Where we going?
- Chinatown, the Hong Kong Restaurant.

529
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:55,741
Phil, will you relax?
We haven't done anything so far...

530
00:41:55,915 --> 00:41:59,043
and they can't lock you up
for just thinking about something.

531
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:00,516
Not yet, anyway.

532
00:42:06,192 --> 00:42:09,787
How's Linda? Has she gotten over
her fishing phobia yet?

533
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:14,424
- No, but she enjoys the boat.
- Not doing any fishing, though.

534
00:42:15,034 --> 00:42:17,298
Nope. I'm still the only fisherman.

535
00:42:19,905 --> 00:42:23,306
I guess it's nice out there on a Sunday.
Peaceful, quiet.

536
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:27,376
Yeah. You ought to try it sometime, Harry.

537
00:42:28,314 --> 00:42:31,340
I'll bet you've forgotten
what the ocean smells like.

538
00:42:31,917 --> 00:42:36,217
I remember when I was a kid, I hitched
a ride on a trolley car to Coney Island.

539
00:42:36,989 --> 00:42:39,082
Saw the ocean for the first time.

540
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,593
God, nothing could make me forget it.

541
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,226
Just blue and green.

542
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,324
You ought to come out on the boat, Harry.

543
00:42:49,468 --> 00:42:50,901
Yeah, I guess I should.

544
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:04,410
Keep it.

545
00:43:05,451 --> 00:43:07,510
You're a very generous citizen.

546
00:43:07,653 --> 00:43:09,746
Take a good look at us,
we're a vanishing breed.

547
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,753
Do you see this, Mac? You know what it is?

548
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:14,722
It's a portable bathroom.
I can't take five minutes off for a piss.

549
00:43:14,894 --> 00:43:17,192
- So don't make jokes with me, mister!
- All right, I'm sorry.

550
00:43:17,329 --> 00:43:20,890
- I didn't mean anything. Here, take this.
- Stick it up your ass!

551
00:43:23,202 --> 00:43:26,137
It's the pollution, Harry.
It makes everybody crazy.

552
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,171
- Do you have any drops with you?
- No.

553
00:43:31,343 --> 00:43:32,810
My eyes are burning.

554
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,507
I tell you, Phil, there's one
wonderful thing about Los Angeles.

555
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:41,075
- What's that?
- It's not Buffalo.

556
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:46,957
You son of a bitch. You know
how many times that I've fallen for that?

557
00:43:51,497 --> 00:43:55,126
Did you see in the paper this morning
where we lost 3,000 helicopters?

558
00:43:55,301 --> 00:43:56,563
You know how much money that is?

559
00:43:56,702 --> 00:43:58,897
Hell, I don't want to hear about that,
drop it.

560
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:01,973
What's the matter?
I mean, the waste, the money.

561
00:44:02,107 --> 00:44:03,699
- The men.
- Men?

562
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:05,173
Yeah, the men.

563
00:44:05,344 --> 00:44:06,709
What do you want me to say about that?

564
00:44:06,879 --> 00:44:10,007
Hell, I just don't want to talk about it.
Screw the helicopters.

565
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,173
For God's sake, Harry,
what are you getting upset...

566
00:44:12,351 --> 00:44:13,750
- Phil, please!
- I just meant the waste...

567
00:44:13,886 --> 00:44:15,513
- Phil!
- The money.

568
00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,423
Remember when I went to Milan last year?

569
00:44:29,702 --> 00:44:31,761
- Cotton mills?
- Yeah, that's right.

570
00:44:31,937 --> 00:44:33,564
Covered the cotton mills.

571
00:44:33,739 --> 00:44:36,606
Then I flew to Rome
and I drove down to Anzio.

572
00:44:41,413 --> 00:44:44,473
There's a ridge there and the sand
is all piled up like a dune...

573
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:46,710
you know; it runs about 200 feet.

574
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:50,455
In 1944 that sand was muddy with blood.

575
00:44:52,424 --> 00:44:54,892
And last year it was covered with bikinis.

576
00:44:55,728 --> 00:44:58,288
Bikinis, you know, cute little buckets...

577
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:01,763
sweating into the same sand
that held all that blood.

578
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:07,363
Hell, I don't want to talk about war.
It's the final joke.

579
00:45:07,506 --> 00:45:11,670
It shouldn't surprise you. Battlefields
have a way of turning into resorts.

580
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,068
Wait a minute.

581
00:45:15,247 --> 00:45:17,238
Yeah! <i>Air Mail Special.</i>

582
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:19,815
Only that's not Charlie Christian,
he was the original.

583
00:45:19,952 --> 00:45:22,614
Oh, Jesus, that was Big Band showtime.

584
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:27,181
One time... I'm just a kid, see?

585
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,358
And I'm playing drums,
we're in this divey joint...

586
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:33,794
it's up in the mountains. We had a vocalist.

587
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,800
Everybody in the band
is banging her except me...

588
00:45:36,935 --> 00:45:39,563
and I got a crush on her. God.

589
00:45:40,806 --> 00:45:41,830
<i>These Foolish Things.</i>

590
00:45:42,007 --> 00:45:45,909
She could sing <i>These Foolish Things,</i>
put you right in Paris.

591
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:48,309
Blonde, blue-eyed...

592
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,313
perfume, the whole whiff of her was just...

593
00:45:51,984 --> 00:45:54,214
Before a number she'd come over...

594
00:45:55,654 --> 00:45:59,181
she'd lean down and she'd whisper
to me, "Easy on the brushes, kid...

595
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:00,882
"easy on the brushes."

596
00:46:01,393 --> 00:46:03,486
She was gonna be vocalist
with Tommy Dorsey.

597
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:06,290
I was gonna play the drums
with Benny Goodman.

598
00:46:06,999 --> 00:46:10,594
The difference is, when we were kids
all the choices were simple.

599
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:14,100
- Life was simple. Everything added up.
- No more.

600
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,565
This morning I gave a ride,
this kid was hitching.

601
00:46:16,709 --> 00:46:18,904
She just goes up and down the Strip.

602
00:46:20,379 --> 00:46:24,042
She wanted to ball me, she said.
No words, just...

603
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:27,474
She was hardly older than my daughter...

604
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:29,587
makes you wonder
what the hell's going on out there.

605
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:32,280
Who knows?
Rats are crawling around babies...

606
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:34,517
they're taking pictures of Mars...

607
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,652
and we're in the balcony
talking to Charlie Robbins.

608
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:29,638
Stoner.

609
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:31,841
How are you? Good to see you again.

610
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:35,316
- Who was that?
- That's Anderson, the Toledo plant.

611
00:47:35,821 --> 00:47:39,018
- We should check the ballroom.
- Hell, Rico's taking care of it.

612
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:41,682
It's his great and glorious moment.
Leave him alone.

613
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,624
- What'll it be, gents?
- Two White Label on the rocks.

614
00:47:44,797 --> 00:47:47,789
You've gotta solve this thing
between Rico and Meyer.

615
00:47:48,534 --> 00:47:49,558
What?

616
00:47:50,068 --> 00:47:51,695
When are you gonna learn Spanish?

617
00:47:51,837 --> 00:47:55,238
When you learn to fish.
I wonder how Freddy's doing.

618
00:47:55,674 --> 00:47:58,438
Freddy doesn't have to do anything.
Margo's doing all the work.

619
00:47:58,610 --> 00:48:00,840
Margo the Machine.
The working man's friend.

620
00:48:36,014 --> 00:48:39,609
Ernie Koy. Indian Ernie, center-field
for the '39 Dodgers.

621
00:48:39,785 --> 00:48:42,185
I damn near had it fleshed out.
Now wait a minute.

622
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:46,018
We had Camilli, Pete Coscarart,
Durocher's at short.

623
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:49,823
Lavagetto's at third, Babe Phelps
is catching...

624
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:53,896
left field is either Moore or Medwick
and center, Ernie Koy in center.

625
00:48:54,066 --> 00:48:56,296
Call for Mr. Stoner. Call for Harry Stoner.

626
00:48:56,435 --> 00:48:58,801
- Christ. All right, yeah. Right field...
- Hi, Mr. Stoner.

627
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:01,098
- I have a call for you.
- I'll be right back. Thank you.

628
00:49:01,273 --> 00:49:04,674
- You have a big show today.
- Yes, we've got a big show today.

629
00:49:05,544 --> 00:49:09,344
Here. Hello, Mr. Stoner,
you got a call for me?

630
00:49:10,749 --> 00:49:12,546
Right field. Damn.

631
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:14,812
Hello.

632
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:22,026
Listen, don't you call anybody,
you stay right there, we'll be right up!

633
00:49:40,512 --> 00:49:41,979
- He's alive.
- What?

634
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,306
- Making sounds.
- Fred?

635
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:46,645
- I got him breathing.
- Oh, my God!

636
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:49,653
What the hell did you...

637
00:49:49,821 --> 00:49:52,654
You call the desk, get Johnny,
and tell him to get the house doctor.

638
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,987
A friend of mine, a buyer, collapsed.
Get an ambulance.

639
00:49:56,161 --> 00:49:58,356
Fred, can you hear me?
It's me, Harry. Fred.

640
00:49:58,497 --> 00:49:59,987
He kept pleading with us to prolong it.

641
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:02,395
Prolong it?
Why, for Christ's sake, you're a pro!

642
00:50:02,534 --> 00:50:04,798
You're supposed to know the limits.
You know how far to go!

643
00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:05,959
For God's sake!

644
00:50:06,138 --> 00:50:07,628
The doctor's on the way! Get out of here!

645
00:50:07,806 --> 00:50:09,296
Shut up and get out,
both of you, right now!

646
00:50:09,474 --> 00:50:10,964
Room 9227.

647
00:50:11,143 --> 00:50:15,512
It looks like it might be a heart attack.
We need the doctor right away, hurry.

648
00:50:16,581 --> 00:50:18,378
I said get out of here!

649
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:22,846
- I'm sorry, Harry.
- Yes, so am I.

650
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,353
Ambulance and doctor on the way.

651
00:50:29,528 --> 00:50:31,655
Damn it! We should have
gotten the order up front.

652
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:34,697
Order? Thank God he's alive!

653
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,532
We're responsible, we set this thing up.

654
00:50:37,703 --> 00:50:40,570
We're to blame here. The man may die.

655
00:50:40,706 --> 00:50:43,231
So he dies!
Then he won't get horny any more.

656
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:47,811
- You're talking about a man, Harry.
- He's not a man, he's a casualty.

657
00:50:56,621 --> 00:51:00,887
Stay with him and tell the doctor to
give him the best and send us the bill.

658
00:51:01,026 --> 00:51:03,221
I got to get down to the show.

659
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:44,894
- Jackie, where the hell is he?
- I haven't the slightest idea.

660
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,695
- They're all sitting down!
- Relax, Rico.

661
00:51:46,905 --> 00:51:49,169
I'm gonna cue the musicians.
We're going to start without him.

662
00:51:49,307 --> 00:51:51,434
Alfie, did you get the rest of the 238's?

663
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:54,636
Everything's been here,
for the last half hour.

664
00:52:04,256 --> 00:52:07,623
Your timing is exquisite.
We were just going on.

665
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:11,021
Are you all right, Mr. Stoner?

666
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:12,788
- I'm fine.
- You're sure?

667
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:14,397
Yes, I'm fine.

668
00:52:21,573 --> 00:52:23,131
<i>Welcome to Los Angeles.</i>

669
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,639
<i>Before we begin our show, this afternoon...</i>

670
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:29,440
<i>I should like to present our president,</i>
<i>the president of Capri Casuals...</i>

671
00:52:29,614 --> 00:52:33,345
<i>the man who made all this possible,</i>
<i>Mr. Harry Stoner.</i>

672
00:52:42,594 --> 00:52:46,121
<i>Thank you. Thank you, Jackie.</i>
<i>First I would like to...</i>

673
00:52:47,899 --> 00:52:51,062
<i>welcome all of you,</i>
<i>thank you for being present...</i>

674
00:52:51,269 --> 00:52:56,172
<i>of course, I don't know all of you</i>
<i>personally, but our field men do.</i>

675
00:53:05,884 --> 00:53:08,079
<i>And through our...</i>

676
00:53:10,689 --> 00:53:12,156
<i>field men...</i>

677
00:53:15,026 --> 00:53:17,961
<i>our professional ties with some of you...</i>

678
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,955
<i>go back 15 years.</i>

679
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:33,541
<i>There are some faces missing.</i>

680
00:53:40,919 --> 00:53:43,353
<i>But the spirit of the company...</i>

681
00:53:49,761 --> 00:53:51,388
<i>Charlie Company.</i>

682
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:59,002
<i>I sincerely hope that you like...</i>

683
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,938
<i>what we're going to present, this afternoon.</i>

684
00:54:07,145 --> 00:54:09,579
<i>Our field men, of course, will...</i>

685
00:54:16,321 --> 00:54:19,848
<i>remain after the show,</i>
<i>to take your orders...</i>

686
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:29,265
<i>and answer the questions,</i>
<i>on delivery dates...</i>

687
00:54:30,068 --> 00:54:34,300
<i>and trajectory and costs.</i>

688
00:54:46,418 --> 00:54:47,544
<i>That's...</i>

689
00:55:14,346 --> 00:55:18,442
<i>Capri has a very special significance</i>
<i>for me...</i>

690
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,448
<i>because I was recuperating there, you see?</i>

691
00:55:22,254 --> 00:55:25,052
<i>It was a sanctuary for the living...</i>

692
00:55:25,223 --> 00:55:28,215
<i>it was beautiful,</i>
<i>Roman columns and it was quiet...</i>

693
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:31,590
<i>and it was filled with men,</i>
<i>brave men that stuck together...</i>

694
00:55:31,796 --> 00:55:35,095
<i>because they believed in something.</i>
<i>It had a very special significance</i>...

695
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,097
- <i>What Mr. Stoner means</i>...
- <i>Capri...</i>

696
00:55:37,302 --> 00:55:41,762
<i>Is that Capri was not an accident,</i>
<i>but rather an inspiration.</i>

697
00:55:41,973 --> 00:55:45,534
<i>Now, how about a nice round</i>
<i>of applause for Mr. Stoner?</i>

698
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:50,171
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

699
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:55,183
<i>we begin our show and our theme,</i>
<i>this afternoon is, Isle of Capri.</i>

700
00:55:56,288 --> 00:55:59,223
<i>We designed this line for the chic woman...</i>

701
00:56:03,128 --> 00:56:05,756
<i>Now as usual, you've all been given</i>
<i>your description list...</i>

702
00:56:05,964 --> 00:56:09,866
<i>of the line so you can check off</i>
<i>your favorite numbers.</i>

703
00:56:10,035 --> 00:56:14,529
<i>So let's start the show this afternoon,</i>
<i>with Number 235...</i>

704
00:56:15,974 --> 00:56:20,741
<i>White, uncrushable linen pantsuit,</i>
<i>marvelous red wallpaper printed shirt...</i>

705
00:56:21,279 --> 00:56:23,747
<i>tied together, with its own matching belt.</i>

706
00:56:24,182 --> 00:56:26,650
<i>Available in two other color combinations.</i>

707
00:56:26,885 --> 00:56:29,376
- Are you all right?
- Fine, yeah.

708
00:56:31,256 --> 00:56:33,622
Something wrong? What the hell is wrong?

709
00:56:33,792 --> 00:56:35,419
Nothing is wrong.

710
00:56:35,694 --> 00:56:36,820
<i>Number 236.</i>

711
00:56:36,995 --> 00:56:40,522
- Harry, that war was 30 years ago.
- I know that.

712
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:43,293
<i>... worn as a beach cover-up or as is...</i>

713
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,298
You're smoking again.

714
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:48,338
How's Freddy?

715
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,608
- Coronary occlusion.
- How bad?

716
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,472
He's in Intensive Care.
He's got the best. Cedars.

717
00:56:53,645 --> 00:56:56,205
- Yes?
- A Dr. Kellen, a specialist.

718
00:56:56,348 --> 00:56:59,215
- Doctor says he has a chance.
- Thank God.

719
00:57:02,854 --> 00:57:04,617
<i>... the color coordinated skirt.</i>

720
00:57:04,756 --> 00:57:06,553
<i>Each one is a winner.</i>

721
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,415
Mr. Stoner?

722
00:57:08,727 --> 00:57:11,355
There's a Ms. Duka in the bar for you.

723
00:57:13,198 --> 00:57:17,635
<i>This is Number 239,</i>
<i>worn by Sheila. A khaki safari...</i>

724
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:20,333
Okay, dear, that's fine.

725
00:57:25,043 --> 00:57:26,635
Is he all right?

726
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:29,207
Yes, he's fine.

727
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:34,413
<i>Number 240...</i>

728
00:57:34,586 --> 00:57:38,818
<i>and it features our new Gondola look,</i>
<i>that's so important in our theme today.</i>

729
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:58,834
- How's the Dragon Lady?
- I sent Dusty to cover my appointments.

730
00:58:00,078 --> 00:58:03,775
I just wanted to tell you Harry, I'm sorry.

731
00:58:05,016 --> 00:58:06,643
Everybody misses.

732
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:09,747
Not professionals.

733
00:58:09,988 --> 00:58:12,752
Yeah, professionals, too.
Quarterbacks get knocked down...

734
00:58:12,924 --> 00:58:15,085
nurses get knocked up,
somebody invented the Edsel.

735
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:16,327
Everybody misses.

736
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:16,759
Everybody misses.

737
00:58:18,897 --> 00:58:22,492
- Would you care for something to drink?
- No. Just the check.

738
00:58:22,634 --> 00:58:23,726
Okay.

739
00:58:25,637 --> 00:58:29,869
Must've scared the hell out of you.
Look, some night let's have dinner.

740
00:58:31,776 --> 00:58:34,142
What are we going to talk about?

741
00:58:36,381 --> 00:58:37,643
Business.

742
00:58:39,551 --> 00:58:42,816
- Yours or mine?
- We both sell the same thing.

743
00:58:44,088 --> 00:58:46,955
- What's that?
- Imagination.

744
00:58:48,059 --> 00:58:50,220
Yeah, that's what they buy.

745
00:58:54,065 --> 00:58:57,626
Trick or treat?
It's always Halloween, isn't it?

746
00:58:58,269 --> 00:58:59,566
Every day.

747
00:59:03,775 --> 00:59:07,336
Well, I just wanted to tell you, Harry,
that I'm sorry.

748
00:59:09,414 --> 00:59:11,644
Let's have dinner some night.

749
00:59:13,284 --> 00:59:14,376
Sure.

750
00:59:16,087 --> 00:59:19,022
- Some night we'll have dinner.
- I mean that.

751
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,352
Okay.

752
00:59:31,803 --> 00:59:35,034
<i>And the first color shocker combines...</i>

753
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:44,042
<i>a side-wrap pleated skirt</i>
<i>with an updated classic shirt...</i>

754
00:59:44,182 --> 00:59:48,118
<i>which you will see throughout this line.</i>
<i>That's Number 242.</i>

755
00:59:50,922 --> 00:59:53,413
<i>And Number 243...</i>

756
00:59:55,126 --> 00:59:57,151
Hey, who let you out?

757
00:59:58,763 --> 01:00:01,231
<i>A packable, washable, banaline...</i>

758
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:04,463
<i>designed to hold and flatter the figure.</i>

759
01:00:04,702 --> 01:00:07,865
<i>It has an elasticized bodice, a bare back...</i>

760
01:00:14,479 --> 01:00:17,812
<i>This is the look that has made our line</i>
<i>so popular in the past.</i>

761
01:00:17,982 --> 01:00:19,677
Hell of a line, Phil.

762
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:23,449
- How are you, Sid?
- I'm good, Phil, like always.

763
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:27,315
I was watching those garments,
they'll walk out of the stores.

764
01:00:27,492 --> 01:00:29,551
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

765
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:34,958
- Phil, you got the gelt?
- Some.

766
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:39,098
Big line, you'll get big orders,
you'll need big money.

767
01:00:39,304 --> 01:00:41,431
- I suppose we will.
- Suppose?

768
01:00:42,006 --> 01:00:44,668
That ain't exactly a <i>bar mitzvah</i>
you're financing.

769
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:47,039
- Got any ideas?
- One or two.

770
01:00:47,178 --> 01:00:48,839
Hello, Sidney, how are they hanging?

771
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,175
They're hanging good, Harry, like always.

772
01:00:51,316 --> 01:00:52,977
How much you boys
selling money for these days?

773
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,982
He has to ask me what the terms are.

774
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:58,885
12% on the unpaid balance,
first of the month and then it graduates.

775
01:00:59,057 --> 01:01:01,252
Graduates? I understand,
it levels off about 200%?

776
01:01:01,392 --> 01:01:03,292
- Well, another account...
- We'll let you know later?

777
01:01:03,461 --> 01:01:05,258
Listen, you guys are in the middle.

778
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,795
The banks, they ain't gonna give you shit.

779
01:01:06,965 --> 01:01:08,626
You make everything run,
they don't grease you.

780
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:11,200
Look around in there, you see any banks?

781
01:01:11,336 --> 01:01:12,803
But we'll throw dice with you.

782
01:01:12,971 --> 01:01:15,337
Yeah, but we got a movie,
we gotta see. Come on, Phil.

783
01:01:15,473 --> 01:01:18,374
Movie? They haven't made
a good movie in 30 years.

784
01:01:18,509 --> 01:01:20,534
- What do you say, fellas?
- We'll keep in touch, okay?

785
01:01:20,678 --> 01:01:22,305
Goodbye, Sidney.

786
01:01:23,147 --> 01:01:28,016
What's that rot you're smoking?
You'll kill yourself smoking that crap.

787
01:01:28,152 --> 01:01:31,019
Here, Havana. Smell the ocean, enjoy.

788
01:01:31,189 --> 01:01:33,157
- We'll talk to you later. Come on, Phil.
- So long, Sid.

789
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,623
Say, that's a nice suit, you're wearing,
Harry. Passatti?

790
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,660
- Yeah.
- Sid, thanks for the cigar.

791
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:38,784
Nothing.

792
01:01:39,864 --> 01:01:41,024
That's a good sign.

793
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:44,362
If the Mob sent Sid, the word
must be out we have a hot line.

794
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:46,799
The Mob has money for us
and the banks don't.

795
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:48,235
It's a great system.

796
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:51,308
Well, I guess the bank figures
if they don't give it to us the Mob will.

797
01:01:51,476 --> 01:01:53,273
The Mob would give it to us all right.

798
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:56,312
Can you imagine living
with their hooks into you?

799
01:01:56,481 --> 01:01:58,574
- No worse than arson.
- It's worse.

800
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:01,317
Remember what happened to
Georgie Kramer, a couple of years ago?

801
01:02:01,452 --> 01:02:03,147
A 400 pound Turk walks in his office...

802
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,312
hangs him out a 13 story window
by his ankles...

803
01:02:05,456 --> 01:02:06,787
and says, "Next time I let go."

804
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:11,461
You know, Harry,
I've never seen one of these things.

805
01:02:11,596 --> 01:02:13,689
- What things?
- A blue movie.

806
01:02:14,666 --> 01:02:18,966
- Just life in a close-up.
- Do they actually show everything?

807
01:02:19,103 --> 01:02:22,266
What's to show? A couple of naked
bodies crawling all over each other...

808
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:25,342
some guy holding a camera hollering,
"Not yet, not yet."

809
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:28,608
Yes, so what was he doing, in a gay bar?

810
01:02:29,714 --> 01:02:31,545
You're putting me on!

811
01:02:33,351 --> 01:02:35,615
So listen, how did you make out?

812
01:02:36,554 --> 01:02:38,715
- Two, please.
- $10.

813
01:02:38,856 --> 01:02:40,016
What?

814
01:02:40,158 --> 01:02:41,455
- $10.
- You're kidding.

815
01:02:41,626 --> 01:02:43,389
$5 a head. You want a pair or not?

816
01:02:43,528 --> 01:02:44,859
What are you giving away?

817
01:02:44,996 --> 01:02:46,987
The name of our attraction
is <i>Denmark Speaks.</i>

818
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,723
Been here for 18 weeks.

819
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,562
Famous smorgasbord scene. Just a minute.

820
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:53,704
You can have a private booth for $15.

821
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:56,864
- Do you qualify for Medicare?
- Yeah? How about that.

822
01:02:57,041 --> 01:02:59,737
If you don't mind, ma'am, please,
two tickets?

823
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:04,972
Let's go.

824
01:03:05,149 --> 01:03:07,083
The Danes have come a long way
from wooden shoes.

825
01:03:07,218 --> 01:03:08,276
That's Holland.

826
01:03:08,453 --> 01:03:11,889
I remember years ago I saw <i>Quo Vadis</i>
here and now they're playing this crap.

827
01:03:12,023 --> 01:03:14,389
It's still the same thing.
They just took their togas off.

828
01:03:26,804 --> 01:03:30,171
<i>... but total joy in the</i>
<i>penultimate seconds of orgasm.</i>

829
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:34,472
<i>The young people in</i>
<i>a totally liberated society...</i>

830
01:03:34,612 --> 01:03:39,140
<i>demonstrate in this scene</i>
<i>the magnificence of fallatio or oral sex.</i>

831
01:03:40,251 --> 01:03:42,617
<i>See how these young people</i>
<i>are made happy...</i>

832
01:03:42,754 --> 01:03:45,120
<i>by the slow feeling of one another...</i>

833
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:56,924
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

834
01:03:57,368 --> 01:03:59,063
- Silk?
- Yeah.

835
01:03:59,804 --> 01:04:01,362
- Hong Kong?
- Rome.

836
01:04:01,639 --> 01:04:02,663
Nice.

837
01:04:02,807 --> 01:04:06,004
Thank you. Give it to me.
Phil, give it to me.

838
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:12,675
Here's the down payment,
the key, and the address.

839
01:04:12,850 --> 01:04:15,375
Don't look at me. Watch the screen.

840
01:04:19,457 --> 01:04:21,425
What time is it vacant?

841
01:04:22,193 --> 01:04:23,490
After 6:00.

842
01:04:24,228 --> 01:04:25,957
What else is there?

843
01:04:26,497 --> 01:04:29,057
Well, there's a shirt company
on the ground floor...

844
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,725
- we're on the second floor, that's all.
- Watch the screen, Harry.

845
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:34,099
We're not exactly
passing state secrets, Charlie.

846
01:04:34,238 --> 01:04:36,968
You don't pump gasoline
with a cigarette in your mouth...

847
01:04:37,141 --> 01:04:38,972
just watch the screen.

848
01:04:39,443 --> 01:04:41,411
How old is the building?

849
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:43,436
Thirty-five?

850
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:46,381
Thirty-seven.

851
01:04:46,684 --> 01:04:48,743
I'll check it out tonight.

852
01:04:49,687 --> 01:04:52,520
Meet me here tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

853
01:04:52,657 --> 01:04:55,057
- Right.
- We don't want anyone hurt.

854
01:04:55,226 --> 01:04:56,659
You want to forget it, say so.

855
01:04:56,794 --> 01:04:58,659
We just don't want anyone hurt, understand?

856
01:04:58,796 --> 01:04:59,990
Look at the screen, Phil.

857
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:03,464
Please, let's net confuse morality
with technology.

858
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:07,604
You're not talking to some pyromaniac.

859
01:05:08,306 --> 01:05:13,039
I've set 15 major industrial fires across
the country in the last three years.

860
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:16,472
I've had two firemen overcome
by smoke inhalation.

861
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:19,673
They both recovered, received citations.

862
01:05:20,818 --> 01:05:23,514
If they'd issue the new C-15 masks...

863
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:26,248
smoke wouldn't be a problem
anymore anyway.

864
01:05:26,424 --> 01:05:28,517
They use them in France, you know.

865
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:31,753
This is a science, gentlemen,
an exact science.

866
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:36,030
Whether or not to set the fire
is a moral question.

867
01:05:36,968 --> 01:05:40,301
- That's up to you.
- It's in your hands, Professor.

868
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:42,167
Enjoy the picture.

869
01:05:42,707 --> 01:05:45,767
10:00 a.m. Here tomorrow, same pew.

870
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:49,606
Nice suit, Harry.

871
01:05:51,782 --> 01:05:53,773
<i>... as you now witness...</i>

872
01:05:53,918 --> 01:05:57,684
You got to respect Charlie, all business.

873
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:00,786
Phil, it is the only way out.

874
01:06:00,992 --> 01:06:05,326
<i>... helps demonstrate explicitly</i>
<i>the amount of precision...</i>

875
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,688
Let's go!

876
01:06:11,469 --> 01:06:13,699
Harry, that man is a lunatic!

877
01:06:13,905 --> 01:06:17,363
Sits there with his hands on his
stomach and a glazed look in his eye.

878
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,805
- He's the best, Phil.
- I think we ought to go back to Sid...

879
01:06:19,944 --> 01:06:22,606
- talk to him and make a deal!
- Phil, will you forget about Sid?

880
01:06:22,747 --> 01:06:24,339
Behind that Havana cigar is a killer.

881
01:06:24,515 --> 01:06:26,210
Yes, but Sid's money can keep us going!

882
01:06:26,384 --> 01:06:29,785
I am not gonna donate a year
of my life paying 200% to any Mob!

883
01:06:29,921 --> 01:06:32,856
Now, do you understand that? I'm sorry.

884
01:06:33,891 --> 01:06:34,915
Go back to the office, will you?

885
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,926
Get together with Meyer and line out
the orders. I'm gonna take a walk.

886
01:06:38,062 --> 01:06:40,223
I'll see you at the office.

887
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:45,193
Hey, Mister. Wanna help us save the tiger?

888
01:06:45,336 --> 01:06:47,236
Only takes a signature.

889
01:06:49,707 --> 01:06:52,369
Only 556 of them left.

890
01:06:52,677 --> 01:06:55,737
Think we ought to keep them around,
don't you?

891
01:06:56,113 --> 01:06:57,444
Yeah.

892
01:07:20,938 --> 01:07:23,202
- How's Cuban Pete?
- Cuban Pete?

893
01:07:24,108 --> 01:07:26,542
He took a walk, he feels great.
How much did we write?

894
01:07:26,677 --> 01:07:30,613
- A little over three. They ate it up.
- What did I tell you?

895
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,383
I'm going home.

896
01:07:38,456 --> 01:07:40,754
You want to have dinner with us?

897
01:07:40,925 --> 01:07:43,052
I don't think so.
Can I borrow one of your shirts?

898
01:07:43,227 --> 01:07:46,128
Help yourself. That's two you owe me.

899
01:07:47,365 --> 01:07:49,890
Salesmen are happy? What'd they say?

900
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:54,598
The usual, "Can we deliver?"
Meyer's going over the orders.

901
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:57,439
He wants to see you.

902
01:07:59,677 --> 01:08:02,942
Well, with what we wrote
discounted at the bank...

903
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:06,616
and Charlie, we're gonna squeeze through.

904
01:08:12,923 --> 01:08:16,188
I checked Swissair, they got a flight
to Geneva, stops in New York.

905
01:08:16,327 --> 01:08:20,058
Good idea. You can see your daughter
before we go to jail.

906
01:08:25,102 --> 01:08:26,797
You wanna go fishing, right, Phil?

907
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:29,132
And we got to get out of bed
every morning.

908
01:08:29,273 --> 01:08:32,504
At least I don't get out of bed
in Beverly Hills.

909
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:36,843
Well, how I lead my life doesn't have
anything to do with our business.

910
01:08:37,014 --> 01:08:40,415
Just takes a little pressure off
when your nut isn't sky high.

911
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:42,883
It's my pressure, Phil, my nut.

912
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:46,149
Except when it spills off.

913
01:08:47,825 --> 01:08:50,259
Like this afternoon at the show.

914
01:08:57,034 --> 01:08:59,127
It's a criminal act, Harry!

915
01:09:02,406 --> 01:09:05,603
What criminal act, Phil?
To keep people working?

916
01:09:05,776 --> 01:09:08,677
That's what you yourself said
this morning, isn't it?

917
01:09:08,846 --> 01:09:12,782
Is it a criminal act to try to hang on
to 15 years of hard work?

918
01:09:12,917 --> 01:09:15,147
What the hell was our dream?

919
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:18,451
To meet a payroll and not a pay check.
Wasn't that the dream?

920
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:21,090
That was the big slice of the pie.

921
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:28,860
Everybody in this whole God damn
country dances around the law, Phil.

922
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:34,036
- Now what's a criminal act? You tell me.
- So the end justifies the means.

923
01:09:34,171 --> 01:09:36,662
Well, that's what they got
up on the scoreboard, baby.

924
01:09:36,807 --> 01:09:39,241
- That's the way they play it.
- Who's "they?" We're "they."

925
01:09:39,410 --> 01:09:41,571
- And there are rules.
- Wrong.

926
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:43,911
Used to be.

927
01:09:44,448 --> 01:09:46,678
No more rules, just referees.

928
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:49,515
And no room out there for losers,
believe me.

929
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:52,850
You and me out on that street again?
Why, Christ! What would we do?

930
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,652
Where would we go?
We're obsolete. You want logic, Phil.

931
01:09:57,027 --> 01:10:00,292
And there is no Ministry of Logic,
in this country.

932
01:10:00,664 --> 01:10:03,132
Performance used to count, right?

933
01:10:03,534 --> 01:10:06,697
For 15 years we've met our obligations
with the same unions...

934
01:10:06,871 --> 01:10:09,271
the same mills, the same bank, but today...

935
01:10:09,406 --> 01:10:11,806
all they care about is the bottom line
on a passbook...

936
01:10:11,976 --> 01:10:15,810
and then some God damn machine
gives you a bum credit rating.

937
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,871
So history doesn't count anymore.

938
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:26,114
It's our place, Phil, we don't get down
on our knees to anybody.

939
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:28,918
You expect me to buy that crap?

940
01:10:29,160 --> 01:10:31,754
For Christ's sakes, Harry,
don't you understand?

941
01:10:31,929 --> 01:10:35,023
It's people like us, people in
the middle, that made this country work.

942
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:38,761
And when people like ourselves
get into this kind of thing...

943
01:10:38,936 --> 01:10:41,803
it takes it all down.
That's what's ripping the country apart!

944
01:10:41,939 --> 01:10:44,203
Son of a bitch,
don't you sell America, to me!

945
01:10:44,375 --> 01:10:48,869
I've got friends over there sitting under
the sand with bikinis on their heads!

946
01:10:58,556 --> 01:11:02,253
I used to get goose bumps
every time I looked at that flag.

947
01:11:05,129 --> 01:11:08,064
When I was a kid, sitting alone
in the room playing the radio...

948
01:11:08,232 --> 01:11:11,531
if they ever played the national anthem,
I stood up all alone in the room.

949
01:11:11,669 --> 01:11:14,797
I stood up at attention.
Don't sell me America!

950
01:11:25,749 --> 01:11:28,843
Now they're making
jock straps out of the flag.

951
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:33,318
Maybe it's terrific.

952
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:38,726
Maybe it's healthy, I don't know.
But I do know there are no more rules.

953
01:11:40,531 --> 01:11:42,260
That stinks, Harry.

954
01:12:03,187 --> 01:12:04,552
Hello, Boss.

955
01:12:14,565 --> 01:12:17,659
- Don't call me Boss.
- But you are.

956
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:22,070
You built the business,
you got the accounts, you made it work.

957
01:12:22,206 --> 01:12:23,935
Don't call me Boss.

958
01:12:25,609 --> 01:12:27,600
How's everything looking?

959
01:12:28,312 --> 01:12:30,872
I don't want to talk about the line.

960
01:12:33,083 --> 01:12:37,281
Meyer, I need Rico and I need you,
now what do you want me to say?

961
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:43,226
Harry, I'm old.

962
01:12:44,828 --> 01:12:47,490
I can't be in a playpen with fairies.

963
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:50,664
Even talented fairies.

964
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:53,635
You have a job here till you die.

965
01:12:53,871 --> 01:12:56,601
But you need Rico. Tell me to get out.

966
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,799
I don't want you out, Meyer.

967
01:12:58,942 --> 01:13:01,809
What do you want? Come on, tell me.

968
01:13:02,513 --> 01:13:05,448
I'm listening. I'm an old stone.

969
01:13:06,483 --> 01:13:08,542
Tell me, what do you want?

970
01:13:14,792 --> 01:13:16,282
Another season.

971
01:13:18,128 --> 01:13:20,323
That's all? Another season?

972
01:13:21,732 --> 01:13:24,394
Just survival? No dreams? No hope?

973
01:13:25,035 --> 01:13:26,127
Hope?

974
01:13:27,304 --> 01:13:30,671
Better ask the little old lady in Vegas
with the Dixie cup full of nickels...

975
01:13:30,841 --> 01:13:34,800
if she still has hope.
She's still looking for the three cherries.

976
01:13:37,081 --> 01:13:40,175
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for you.

977
01:13:41,385 --> 01:13:43,148
You're sorry for me?

978
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:48,284
You've spent most of your life
running from pogroms, Nazis.

979
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:51,622
Bent over a machine.
What the hell have you got?

980
01:13:53,464 --> 01:13:58,197
I have my craft. My work. And a woman.

981
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:02,200
Old, but still lovely.

982
01:14:04,341 --> 01:14:08,243
I like to look at her, to listen to her talk.

983
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:12,706
So sweet. And it's every day.

984
01:14:17,388 --> 01:14:18,787
That's good.

985
01:14:21,091 --> 01:14:25,994
Yeah, that's good. Now get out of here.

986
01:14:27,164 --> 01:14:30,190
Let me work. I'll deal with the fairy.

987
01:14:30,701 --> 01:14:34,068
We've had our talk. Go to your mansion.

988
01:14:34,805 --> 01:14:36,830
Go to your Mexican cook.

989
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:40,875
Go and speak Spanish to your Mexican cook.

990
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:46,478
- For Christ's sake, Meyer.
- Go home, Harry. Get some sleep.

991
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:54,656
Yeah, okay.

992
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:04,194
Good night, Harry.

993
01:15:05,602 --> 01:15:07,263
Good night, Meyer.

994
01:15:26,256 --> 01:15:30,158
- Hello?
- <i>Babe? Hi, how was the flight?</i>

995
01:15:31,128 --> 01:15:34,965
I don't know. I took some pills,
I slept through it. I was going to call you.

996
01:15:34,965 --> 01:15:35,226
I don't know. I took some pills,
I slept through it. I was going to call you.

997
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:37,333
- <i>How'd the show go?</i>
- Just fine.

998
01:15:37,534 --> 01:15:40,469
- <i>That's marvelous.</i>
- Yeah, it was just fine.

999
01:15:40,871 --> 01:15:42,498
<i>You sound tired. Why don't you go home?</i>

1000
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:45,004
<i>Carmela has something prepared.</i>

1001
01:15:45,242 --> 01:15:48,177
Janet, how would you like
to make it with me right now?

1002
01:15:48,345 --> 01:15:51,576
<i>A couple of old veterans like us</i>
<i>can do it with words.</i>

1003
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,546
- Are you all right?
- <i>Yes, I'm all right.</i>

1004
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:57,543
Remember that time,
in the South of France?

1005
01:15:57,721 --> 01:15:59,484
That room over the little French restaurant?

1006
01:15:59,656 --> 01:16:01,146
In Saint-Tropez?

1007
01:16:01,725 --> 01:16:03,283
God, we made love like a couple of kids.

1008
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:06,725
Up, down, sideways, every way.

1009
01:16:07,798 --> 01:16:09,857
Candlelight, it was beautiful.

1010
01:16:10,868 --> 01:16:13,200
Who was that singer, remember?

1011
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,270
We could hear her voice
through the shutters.

1012
01:16:15,405 --> 01:16:18,602
God, I can't remember her name,
what was her name?

1013
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:20,141
Françoise Hardy.

1014
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:22,676
Françoise Hardy, that's it, yeah.

1015
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:25,744
You remember. God, that was a sweet time.

1016
01:16:26,216 --> 01:16:28,150
That was six years ago, Harry.

1017
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,450
<i>For God's sake, get out</i>
<i>of the God damn office. Go home.</i>

1018
01:16:32,656 --> 01:16:37,059
Carmela has something prepared.
I'll call you tomorrow. Goodbye, Harry.

1019
01:18:13,190 --> 01:18:15,750
- Man in the silk suit.
- Yep.

1020
01:18:16,793 --> 01:18:20,889
- You put in a long day, mister.
- Every day.

1021
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:27,195
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere.

1022
01:18:28,372 --> 01:18:30,397
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1023
01:18:33,143 --> 01:18:37,375
Well, listen, I'm house sitting out
at the beach. Want to take me?

1024
01:18:46,323 --> 01:18:47,813
Jesus, why not?

1025
01:18:49,593 --> 01:18:52,824
Mobile R-X 1-3-1-1-1 calling.

1026
01:18:54,431 --> 01:18:58,299
Good evening, could you get me
2-7-5-4-6-9-9, please? Thank you.

1027
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:10,145
<i>No me esperes.</i>

1028
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:20,920
- Knocks me out.
- What?

1029
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:23,149
A car phone, it's far out.

1030
01:19:24,428 --> 01:19:25,986
You must be rich.

1031
01:19:27,064 --> 01:19:28,326
Sometimes.

1032
01:19:29,433 --> 01:19:31,060
Your wife Spanish?

1033
01:19:32,169 --> 01:19:33,466
The maid.

1034
01:19:35,639 --> 01:19:37,698
How come you speak Spanish?

1035
01:19:38,642 --> 01:19:41,406
Well, my father had a store...

1036
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:44,342
in the first Puerto Rican neighborhood
in New York. When I was a kid...

1037
01:19:44,514 --> 01:19:46,482
after school I used to work there.

1038
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:48,947
- What kind of store?
- Pharmacy.

1039
01:19:49,352 --> 01:19:52,879
- You mean a drugstore?
- Yeah, a drugstore.

1040
01:19:54,658 --> 01:19:56,888
- Did you turn on?
- Turn on?

1041
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,961
Hell, we didn't know uppers, downers,
or any of the...

1042
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:02,063
If you were lucky then you got an enema.

1043
01:20:02,232 --> 01:20:03,358
Enema.

1044
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:09,198
It's a long ride to the beach.

1045
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:12,565
It's all right, I want to see the ocean again.

1046
01:20:12,743 --> 01:20:14,836
Get out of that zoo for a change.

1047
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:18,344
I really hate zoos.
Those animals are so miserable.

1048
01:20:19,116 --> 01:20:23,416
I saw this National Geographic
about lions and tigers...

1049
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,447
how they always return
to a place of remembered beauty.

1050
01:20:29,126 --> 01:20:31,219
That's how they catch them.

1051
01:20:33,764 --> 01:20:36,699
If your fairy godmother showed up
and you had three wishes...

1052
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,834
what would you wish for?

1053
01:20:41,872 --> 01:20:44,500
Peace, and harmony...

1054
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:49,511
and to make it with Mick Jagger.

1055
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:51,711
Jesus!

1056
01:20:52,883 --> 01:20:55,943
Well, I guess there's nothing wrong
with that.

1057
01:21:05,028 --> 01:21:09,863
I just happen to have
some really great grass.

1058
01:21:15,705 --> 01:21:17,900
God. Why did you want
to ball me this morning?

1059
01:21:18,041 --> 01:21:19,440
I don't know.

1060
01:21:20,644 --> 01:21:24,546
You looked nice, you smelled nice.
You still do.

1061
01:21:25,348 --> 01:21:28,875
I was a little stoned,
just sort of popped out.

1062
01:21:33,690 --> 01:21:35,282
I'm really 21.

1063
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:38,222
I kind of figured that, yeah.

1064
01:21:43,733 --> 01:21:45,200
You dig grass?

1065
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:47,662
Do I... grass? Christ, I haven't had
any of that for years.

1066
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:48,862
We used to call it gage.

1067
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:50,370
- Gage?
- Yeah.

1068
01:21:50,540 --> 01:21:53,976
So when I was a kid I was a drummer.
And musicians have their own...

1069
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,544
lingo, you know, we called it gage.

1070
01:21:56,713 --> 01:21:57,839
Gage.

1071
01:22:27,878 --> 01:22:30,904
- Got those in Italy.
- In a fight?

1072
01:22:32,082 --> 01:22:34,346
- In a war.
- In Italy?

1073
01:22:35,785 --> 01:22:39,186
- In Italy.
- We never fought a war with Italy.

1074
01:22:42,559 --> 01:22:45,460
You'd be amazed what we did in Italy.

1075
01:22:48,765 --> 01:22:51,893
- Well...
- You're older than 33.

1076
01:22:53,036 --> 01:22:56,062
Yeah. You got another joint?

1077
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,972
- Tell me.
- What?

1078
01:23:00,710 --> 01:23:02,644
Tell me how old you are.

1079
01:23:03,780 --> 01:23:06,943
2,500, I helped Moses part the Red Sea.

1080
01:23:09,286 --> 01:23:12,346
And there was Kamu,
swimming against the tides.

1081
01:23:14,391 --> 01:23:16,092
Swimming against the tide.

1082
01:23:16,092 --> 01:23:16,456
Swimming against the tide.

1083
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:21,962
I'm standing, I'm looking over the River
Jordan with Moses and Albert Speer.

1084
01:23:22,098 --> 01:23:25,465
And Moses says,
"Tell me, Al, did you really know..."

1085
01:23:25,635 --> 01:23:28,502
"did you know?"
And Speer starts screaming:

1086
01:23:28,672 --> 01:23:31,573
"Me? I never asked Keitel,
I never asked Himmler...

1087
01:23:31,708 --> 01:23:33,471
"I never asked Goebbels.

1088
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:39,380
"No, those death camps were outside
the perimeter of my activities."

1089
01:23:41,418 --> 01:23:43,716
You want a wet washcloth, or something?

1090
01:23:43,853 --> 01:23:46,083
First class, on the <i>Enola Gay...</i>

1091
01:23:46,256 --> 01:23:50,056
me, and Ruby, and Sirhan, and Ray...

1092
01:23:51,728 --> 01:23:56,097
and Tippet, and Jack, and Bobby,
and King, and Medgar, and Malcolm.

1093
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:58,795
Marilyn's the stewardess.

1094
01:23:58,935 --> 01:24:01,233
She's wonderful, she's talking
to all the people but then...

1095
01:24:01,371 --> 01:24:05,205
suddenly the captain's voice comes
crackling through that loudspeaker...

1096
01:24:05,342 --> 01:24:07,367
and it's Eichmann, and he's screaming:

1097
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:11,105
"Please, on the ports, pay attention!
That is the new high-rise...

1098
01:24:11,281 --> 01:24:16,014
"forty stories high, the Mee Lai Hotel.
Six Olympic swimming pools...

1099
01:24:16,252 --> 01:24:20,621
"Twelve massage parlors,
and an 18-hole golf course."

1100
01:24:20,790 --> 01:24:22,382
And then Ruby...

1101
01:24:22,559 --> 01:24:26,757
Ruby suddenly screams at him, he says,
"Wait a minute, you schmuck!

1102
01:24:27,497 --> 01:24:31,957
"What about that ditch?
What about that ditch?"

1103
01:24:36,306 --> 01:24:39,503
Then Marilyn gives Ruby a great, big kiss.

1104
01:24:43,713 --> 01:24:45,146
Come down.

1105
01:24:45,281 --> 01:24:48,079
What down? I am, I'm coming down.

1106
01:24:48,218 --> 01:24:50,652
I'm coming down the mountain.
Kid, I've got the tablets.

1107
01:24:50,820 --> 01:24:53,311
I've got the 11 th commandment.

1108
01:24:55,225 --> 01:24:56,783
What does it say?

1109
01:24:58,862 --> 01:25:01,592
"No parking on this side of the street."

1110
01:25:04,601 --> 01:25:05,693
God.

1111
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:09,330
No. Oh, no.

1112
01:25:09,472 --> 01:25:11,531
- Come on...
- Jesus, no, please.

1113
01:25:11,741 --> 01:25:14,505
- Yeah, come on.
- I can't.

1114
01:25:14,744 --> 01:25:16,837
- Come on, let's make it again.
- No, I can't.

1115
01:25:17,013 --> 01:25:18,480
Let's play a game.

1116
01:25:18,615 --> 01:25:20,480
- A game?
- A game, yeah.

1117
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:23,810
The game, you name famous people, see?

1118
01:25:24,254 --> 01:25:25,278
Name famous people.

1119
01:25:25,422 --> 01:25:27,481
- Just anyone?
- Anyone famous. Just name them.

1120
01:25:27,657 --> 01:25:28,681
Dead people, too?

1121
01:25:28,858 --> 01:25:31,827
Why not? Some of my best friends
are dead people.

1122
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:35,324

01:25:43,139 --> 01:25:45,471

but it doesn't matter...

1127
01:25:45,642 --> 01:25:47,234
just go ahead, play the game,

I'll do my best.

1203
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:25,131
Have a nice day.

1204
01:32:26,409 --> 01:32:27,876
You, too, Myra.

1205
01:32:48,030 --> 01:32:52,763
<i>... see examples of what suppression of</i>
<i>sexual appetite can bring, deviation...</i>

1206
01:32:59,242 --> 01:33:01,642
- You're late.
- Yeah, sorry, Charlie.

1207
01:33:05,248 --> 01:33:06,340
Here.

1208
01:33:06,549 --> 01:33:08,608
<i>... now once again we...</i>

1209
01:33:08,885 --> 01:33:11,410
- That's your retainer.
- I am aware of that.

1210
01:33:11,554 --> 01:33:14,921
- What's wrong?
- Don't look at me, watch the screen.

1211
01:33:15,191 --> 01:33:18,786
You're in violation of every fire
ordinance in the book...

1212
01:33:18,961 --> 01:33:22,624
faulty sprinklers, no access
to exit doors, dried up extinguishers.

1213
01:33:22,798 --> 01:33:26,234
- My God, I never saw the equal of it.
- What the hell does that mean, Charlie?

1214
01:33:26,369 --> 01:33:30,135
With all those violations,
the insurance will never pay off.

1215
01:33:30,306 --> 01:33:32,672
I'll give you a list of regulations
to conform to.

1216
01:33:32,808 --> 01:33:35,868
- Fix everything up and I'll burn it.
- How long will that take?

1217
01:33:36,012 --> 01:33:39,413
Watch the screen, Harry.
Six months minimum.

1218
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:43,309
You can't light up new equipment,
it bears the date of installation.

1219
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:45,147
Well, that's that.

1220
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,482
Not necessarily.

1221
01:33:48,624 --> 01:33:52,287
I could start the fire downstairs,
in the shirt factory.

1222
01:33:52,428 --> 01:33:54,020
You mean Siegel's place?

1223
01:33:54,196 --> 01:33:56,221
Why not?
I can get in there without any trouble.

1224
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:59,163
The access door's practically fallen off.

1225
01:33:59,335 --> 01:34:01,895
I'll funnel the fire up the back to your place.

1226
01:34:02,038 --> 01:34:03,869
Should work out fine.

1227
01:34:04,006 --> 01:34:05,598
Won't you have the same
insurance problems?

1228
01:34:05,708 --> 01:34:09,109
No, with the source of the fire
downstairs, they'll pay off.

1229
01:34:09,278 --> 01:34:12,247
You may get a reprimand,
but they'll have to pay off.

1230
01:34:12,415 --> 01:34:15,248
And Siegel?
I mean he has nothing to say about it?

1231
01:34:15,418 --> 01:34:18,683
Don't worry about Siegel, he'll do fine.
Probably a blessing.

1232
01:34:18,821 --> 01:34:21,688
Actually, I'll do a force funnel job.

1233
01:34:21,891 --> 01:34:24,689
The shirt factory will sustain
very little damage...

1234
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,351
the fire will flash in your place.

1235
01:34:28,397 --> 01:34:32,458
Hell, should be over in three, four minutes.

1236
01:34:34,870 --> 01:34:37,668
- When would you do it?
- That's up to you.

1237
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:40,432
I'll go get a Coca Cola.

1238
01:34:40,876 --> 01:34:43,504
<i>... man and woman, Adam and Eve</i>
<i>were naked.</i>

1239
01:34:44,513 --> 01:34:47,414
<i>Unashamed. Enjoying the natural</i>
<i>state of pleasure...</i>

1240
01:34:47,550 --> 01:34:50,041
<i>a man and woman were meant to be in.</i>

1241
01:34:50,186 --> 01:34:53,644
<i>The entire history of man</i>
<i>from the cradle of civilization...</i>

1242
01:34:53,823 --> 01:34:58,385
<i>to the present is studded with the art</i>
<i>of man's pornographic impressions.</i>

1243
01:35:00,329 --> 01:35:01,956
<i>You can now see...</i>

1244
01:35:02,565 --> 01:35:06,365
<i>paintings through drawings on stone...</i>

1245
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:10,430
<i>bear the pictorial record</i>
<i>of man's search for erotica.</i>

1246
01:35:28,324 --> 01:35:30,053
Anything happens, you never heard of Phil...

1247
01:35:30,192 --> 01:35:33,218
- never heard of him, understood?
- Understood.

1248
01:35:34,797 --> 01:35:38,597
Sunday, Phil goes fishing.
Burn it Sunday, Charlie.

1249
01:35:41,637 --> 01:35:44,504
- Same suit, Harry?
- Yeah. Same suit.

1250
01:37:17,099 --> 01:37:19,329
Hey, mister, throw the ball!

1251
01:37:38,921 --> 01:37:41,014
What did you do that for?

1252
01:37:41,457 --> 01:37:44,221
I thought you ought to see it just once.

1253
01:37:49,498 --> 01:37:51,830
You can't play with us, mister.
