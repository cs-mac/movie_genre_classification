1
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:24,275
Hey, we need gasoline.

2
00:04:24,481 --> 00:04:29,441
Where's the gasoline?
Hey, hombres, gasoline.

3
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,699
- "Americanos"?
- Yes!

4
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:45,567
Passports, "por favor".

5
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,837
Airplane papers, please.

6
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,290
No good.

7
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,201
Why the hell did we have to wander
into this place for?

8
00:05:57,407 --> 00:06:01,343
Why couldn't we have wandered
into Monaco or someplace?

9
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,810
When I was a kid,
they called me Fat Morty.

10
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:15,787
When I was seven years old,
I weighed 280 pounds.

11
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,026
But I was the smartest kid
on the block, man.

12
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:22,629
And I never ate "goy drek".
I took my bar mitzvah.

13
00:06:22,832 --> 00:06:26,768
I was growing up to be
like a Talmudic scholar.

14
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:31,439
I was.
Rabbi Wolf.

15
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,075
And now, I am a man
without a country.

16
00:06:48,557 --> 00:06:52,960
Lewis, look what's coming.

17
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:03,765
American, right? I can't believe it.
A real live American.

18
00:07:03,972 --> 00:07:06,998
- How's the old U.S. Of A?
- I don't know...

19
00:07:07,209 --> 00:07:09,370
I haven't been there in 2 years.

20
00:07:09,578 --> 00:07:13,639
My name is Wolfie.
This is my partner, Lewis Moon.

21
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,148
- Lewis? Lewis?
- I'm Andy Huben.

22
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:20,879
He's pleased to meet you,
he just has no manners. That's all.

23
00:07:21,089 --> 00:07:25,287
- Would you like a drink?
- No, I'm sorry, I can't.

24
00:07:27,829 --> 00:07:31,265
Wait, wait... Andy, right?

25
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:35,798
What are you doing here?
This is like the end of the world.

26
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,364
We've chosen to be here.

27
00:07:38,573 --> 00:07:41,974
My husband is in charge of the
evangelical missions in the territory.

28
00:07:43,445 --> 00:07:46,573
You're here to teach the
Lord's word to the Indians.

29
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,647
Perfect, 'cause I got a halfbreed
Cheyenne over here...

30
00:07:52,854 --> 00:07:56,984
is one of the worst sinners
you'll ever meet.

31
00:07:57,592 --> 00:08:01,824
Would you please do your duty
and save his red-skinned soul?

32
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:04,991
Leslie, this is Mr. Wolf.

33
00:08:07,134 --> 00:08:11,833
- Let's get these boxes upstairs.
- What's wrong? Do I got the plague?

34
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:13,768
If you got the plague,
then I would tend to you.

35
00:08:13,974 --> 00:08:17,671
But yours is the plague
of blasphemy and fornication.

36
00:08:18,312 --> 00:08:20,837
I've never fornicated in my life.

37
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:24,575
In fact, I don't think I even really
know what it means.

38
00:08:25,185 --> 00:08:27,813
Is it technical?

39
00:08:36,764 --> 00:08:39,733
Can you believe I dreamed about this?

40
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:45,934
When I was about Billy's age,
I dreamed about coming to the Amazon.

41
00:08:48,042 --> 00:08:50,101
And here we are.

42
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:26,505
- Hazel, right?
- It's so good to see you.

43
00:09:26,714 --> 00:09:28,682
I can't believe we are here.

44
00:09:28,882 --> 00:09:32,840
Billy Quarrier, huh?
Welcome aboard, Bill. Hi, Martin.

45
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,043
Mr. Huben, how are you?

46
00:09:35,254 --> 00:09:38,018
I knew you from your picture.

47
00:09:38,224 --> 00:09:40,988
We're very proud we were chosen
to work with you.

48
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:43,253
My family read your
mission letters aloud.

49
00:09:43,463 --> 00:09:46,364
- My wife, Andy.
- Your little helpmeet.

50
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:50,495
Hi, Billy, welcome to the jungle.
My name's Andy.

51
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:53,331
- Hi, Andy.
- Mrs. Huben to you, young man.

52
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,202
I've compiled a little Niaruna
dictionary to get you started.

53
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:01,608
- Great.
- Uyuyu helps us with the Lord's work.

54
00:10:01,814 --> 00:10:05,181
The Catholic opposition had him.
Now he's ours.

55
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:08,915
I mean, now he follows
the true path to God.

56
00:10:12,225 --> 00:10:15,626
And they call this degradation
Mãe de Deus...

57
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:18,455
Poor mother of God.

58
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:23,199
Mr. And Mrs. Huben, "Bom dia".

59
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,600
- This is Father Xantes.
- How do you do? How was your trip?

60
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:31,676
"Bom, obrigado".

61
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:36,274
Martin Quarrier.
"Esta minha esposa, Hazel".

62
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,906
"Please, please".

63
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:41,416
Allow me to practice my poor English.

64
00:10:41,621 --> 00:10:45,489
Mrs. Quarrier, if I can be
of any help, let me know.

65
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:51,631
Billy! Don't touch that! Can't you
see everything here is dirty?

66
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:53,626
Everything.

67
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:56,892
It's just a bit of pineapple,
Mrs. Quarrier.

68
00:10:57,102 --> 00:10:58,831
Let's go, folks.

69
00:10:59,171 --> 00:11:01,036
You stay right with me, young man.

70
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:03,104
- The leader of the opposition?
- "No".

71
00:11:03,308 --> 00:11:04,969
We just spent 4 nights
in a filthy hotel...

72
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:10,137
with awful food and disgusting bugs.
Now we have to rot here for 3 weeks?

73
00:11:10,348 --> 00:11:12,543
That's our hotel.

74
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:15,549
- The Anaconda.
- That's right.

75
00:11:16,054 --> 00:11:18,022
Far, far away

76
00:11:18,223 --> 00:11:20,350
In sin and darkness dwelling

77
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:24,928
Millions of souls
forever may be lost

78
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,624
Who then will go
Salvation's story telling

79
00:11:29,835 --> 00:11:34,238
Looking to Jesus, minding not
the cost?

80
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,739
- All power is given...
- Come in.

81
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:43,313
All power is given unto me

82
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:47,645
Go ye into all the world
And preach the gospel

83
00:11:47,853 --> 00:11:53,723
And, lo, I am with you, always

84
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:56,416
- Welcome to Mãe de Deus.
- Glory be the God.

85
00:11:59,698 --> 00:12:01,165
What did he say?

86
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,890
Yes, "to Jesus..."

87
00:12:04,102 --> 00:12:07,538
"To Jesus, to Jesus."

88
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,441
Uyuyu, are you a Niaruna?

89
00:12:11,643 --> 00:12:15,739
No, but speaks Niaruna.
He's been very useful to us.

90
00:12:15,947 --> 00:12:18,972
And a God Christian, right, Uyuyu?

91
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:21,248
"Obrigada."

92
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:27,547
We've established good contacts
with the Tiro and Mintipo.

93
00:12:27,758 --> 00:12:30,226
The Niaruna situation,
is quite different.

94
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:33,590
A few accepted Catholicism, but...

95
00:12:33,798 --> 00:12:37,393
most of them are still wild.
The Catholics abandoned the mission...

96
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:39,762
so we took it over.

97
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:42,962
The Niaruna land is coveted by...

98
00:12:43,174 --> 00:12:47,372
ruthless people who have anything
in mind but the glory of our Lord.

99
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,974
Comandante Guzman is just
waiting for a good excuse to...

100
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:53,172
pacify them.

101
00:12:54,318 --> 00:12:57,116
- What do you mean, Mr. Huben?
- Les.

102
00:12:57,588 --> 00:12:59,419
- Les.
- I mean attack...

103
00:12:59,623 --> 00:13:03,252
drive them out, kill them if necessary.
Take over their land.

104
00:13:04,461 --> 00:13:07,259
But that's Indian land.

105
00:13:07,598 --> 00:13:11,932
Correct me if I'm wrong, but attacking
them is against national law.

106
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,834
Here in the jungle, Mart,
there is no law.

107
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:20,567
I see.

108
00:13:25,316 --> 00:13:27,682
You see, many of the tribes here...

109
00:13:27,952 --> 00:13:30,648
think that their shaman, who is...

110
00:13:30,855 --> 00:13:35,292
kind of like their minister,
is a jaguar.

111
00:13:35,993 --> 00:13:41,090
What I mean is that he can become
a jaguar at night...

112
00:13:41,732 --> 00:13:46,293
and travel off into
the spirit world.

113
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,937
- Can he?
- Shamans?

114
00:13:51,674 --> 00:13:56,543
Bad enough your head is filled with
such nonsense, let alone a child's.

115
00:13:56,746 --> 00:14:00,739
All he thinks about are naked Indians
and jaguars and awful snakes.

116
00:14:01,017 --> 00:14:02,644
Come to bed.

117
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,013
Get in bed.

118
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:15,157
Jaguars.

119
00:14:16,332 --> 00:14:18,857
- Good night, son.
- Good night.

120
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:31,444
I suppose you think I should take
Billy back home to the States.

121
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:34,748
I never said that.

122
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,219
Leave you here with these
prostitutes... Is that what you want?

123
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:44,223
Hazel, what are you talking about?

124
00:14:51,401 --> 00:14:52,834
Hazel...

125
00:14:53,436 --> 00:14:56,166
we have two or three
more weeks here.

126
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:59,671
You should learn a little Portuguese.

127
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:02,140
A Catholic language?

128
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:10,340
If I let you go and it turns out...

129
00:15:10,552 --> 00:15:13,282
you are fugitives...

130
00:15:13,488 --> 00:15:17,447
or the plane is stolen,
or worse...

131
00:15:18,827 --> 00:15:21,523
what can I do?

132
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,668
Look at this, please.

133
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:33,298
Every day,
all these people get here.

134
00:15:33,508 --> 00:15:36,443
Every day.
They want to settle...

135
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:39,739
to feed their families.

136
00:15:40,282 --> 00:15:45,811
My job is to stop these people
from taking the Indian land.

137
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:51,057
But sometimes,
when people are starving...

138
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:53,955
nobody can stop them.

139
00:15:54,963 --> 00:15:57,955
And some already go to this land.

140
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:01,693
Niaruna are very dangerous.

141
00:16:02,704 --> 00:16:05,400
What do you think will happen?

142
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:10,010
You know the answer, you Americanos.

143
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:16,543
Look, here is Mãe de Deus.

144
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:20,688
Very small, no?
Not even on the map.

145
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:24,723
Up there, following the river...

146
00:16:24,926 --> 00:16:27,690
you find mountains...

147
00:16:27,896 --> 00:16:34,130
and then starts the land of the
Niaruna. The savages, savages.

148
00:16:36,804 --> 00:16:39,295
What's the point?

149
00:16:41,075 --> 00:16:44,602
I like these Niaruna very much.

150
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:47,513
I'm pleased to protect them...

151
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,945
but they don't need all this land.

152
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:52,278
It's too much for
a few dozen people...

153
00:16:52,486 --> 00:16:57,480
who do nothing from morning to night.
It's inhuman.

154
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:02,455
Anyway, these Indians
are not very nice.

155
00:17:02,663 --> 00:17:08,295
Their chief, Boronai,
he would kill you like that.

156
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:12,731
I told you about Boronai.

157
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:22,474
I just need a little favor.

158
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:29,318
A foreign airplane passing over
their village...

159
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:35,086
some little bombs fell out
these Indians will run away.

160
00:17:35,896 --> 00:17:37,955
This way they are safe.

161
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,128
I get it.

162
00:17:41,502 --> 00:17:45,268
You want us to blow the little
brown pricks to kingdom come.

163
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:50,134
No, no, no.
The idea is not to kill them.

164
00:17:50,344 --> 00:17:52,904
It's only to scare them.

165
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,105
For their own good.

166
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,710
They will find another place.

167
00:17:58,918 --> 00:18:00,783
"Con permiso."

168
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,505
When we get back,
we get our papers, right?

169
00:18:21,741 --> 00:18:26,041
- And a tank of gas?
- I don't see why not.

170
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:40,151
Hey, preacher, in 2 or 3 days
we'll be gone.

171
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,989
And you get this stinking
toilet to yourselves.

172
00:19:10,456 --> 00:19:12,788
Ei, amigo, trouxe "ayahuasca" para você.
[I've brought "ayahuasca" for you]

173
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:15,654
Eu acho que é muito bom.
[I think it's very good]

174
00:19:23,235 --> 00:19:25,760
Dá mais um pouco.
[Give a little more]

175
00:19:34,479 --> 00:19:35,969
Howdy.

176
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:41,350
You mind if I sit down here?

177
00:19:49,294 --> 00:19:52,263
Ayahuasca?
Care to blow your mind?

178
00:19:52,464 --> 00:19:54,762
You better watch yourself.

179
00:19:54,967 --> 00:20:00,064
That there is a very poisonous drug.
The Indians call that Nipi.

180
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:03,537
That stuff can kill you.

181
00:20:10,282 --> 00:20:12,773
Do you know what this is?

182
00:20:14,853 --> 00:20:18,584
It's a Niaruna-to-English dictionary.

183
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:21,725
It's the very first of its kind.

184
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,259
You might even be interested in this.

185
00:20:24,463 --> 00:20:30,493
For instance, the Sioux word for
"Great Spirit" is "Wakantanka".

186
00:20:30,969 --> 00:20:34,564
You won't believe what it is Niaruna.

187
00:20:34,773 --> 00:20:36,400
"Wakankon".

188
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:38,869
The Great Spirit, huh?

189
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:42,535
Yeah. You find all these
surprising similarities...

190
00:20:42,748 --> 00:20:45,376
between the Plains Indians
and these people.

191
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:47,642
Shit!

192
00:20:48,619 --> 00:20:51,986
There are greater similarities between
my people and Crow and Shoshone...

193
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:56,056
and we killed them every chance
we got and they killed us to...

194
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:00,560
because we were too fucking stupid
to recognize our real enemy.

195
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:14,773
You got the call, Reverend?

196
00:21:16,213 --> 00:21:20,616
Jesus wants you for his
little sunbeam, right?

197
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:27,480
You have faith in Lord?

198
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,088
Did you earn it, or were you
stuffed with it like a turkey?

199
00:21:36,467 --> 00:21:40,198
I don't appreciate
been talk to that way.

200
00:21:40,504 --> 00:21:43,098
And as far as my faith goes,
that's something I work out...

201
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:48,506
day by day with
the help of the Lord.

202
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:56,979
You really like the Indians.

203
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:01,352
Their language, their customs...
they interest you.

204
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,188
Yes, they interest me a great deal.

205
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:08,388
So, why do you want
to change them?

206
00:22:08,632 --> 00:22:11,624
If God made the Indians the way
they are...

207
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:15,032
who are you to make them different?

208
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:33,647
Do you really intend
to bomb the Niaruna?

209
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:45,325
I'd hoped you'd tell me that
wasn't true.

210
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:48,036
Telling lies is a sin.

211
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:52,470
The Niaruna you intend to murder are
the ones I came here to work with...

212
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:54,575
Mr. Moon.

213
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:58,306
I can't believe you would do that.

214
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:02,952
- You're part Indian yourself.
- Which part? My prick?

215
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:07,551
Let me tell you that as an American
I'd be proud...

216
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:13,753
to have Indian blood. I think a lot of
Americans would be proud to have it.

217
00:23:15,465 --> 00:23:17,558
They would, huh?

218
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:25,673
Just how much Indian blood would
most Americans be proud to have?

219
00:23:49,665 --> 00:23:51,997
Hey, preacher.

220
00:23:54,269 --> 00:23:56,737
I'm talking to you.

221
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,676
That other guy around here,
the scout leader...

222
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:05,605
is he your boss?

223
00:24:06,315 --> 00:24:09,182
He is my superior, yes.

224
00:24:09,751 --> 00:24:14,916
And your wife,
she's the big one, right?

225
00:24:15,224 --> 00:24:17,852
The one with dark hair?

226
00:24:20,062 --> 00:24:25,193
- Yes, my wife is the big one.
- And the pretty one is his?

227
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:31,501
Yes, the pretty one is his.

228
00:24:32,307 --> 00:24:34,832
You screwed her yet?

229
00:24:36,245 --> 00:24:40,079
I'm not gonna take this anymore!

230
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:42,807
You have a demon in you!

231
00:24:43,018 --> 00:24:46,249
You're nothing but a drunk,
vicious coward!

232
00:24:46,455 --> 00:24:51,654
You want to come outside?
Step outside if you're man enough!

233
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,296
I'm calling you a coward!

234
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:58,398
You'll get tired of it after a while.

235
00:25:13,481 --> 00:25:16,348
What am I doing?

236
00:25:21,756 --> 00:25:26,716
Preacher, I think you should relax
and give the old pecker a workout.

237
00:25:31,999 --> 00:25:34,627
You might even like it.

238
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:37,997
Wolfie, he thinks fucking is a sin.

239
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:42,808
Me and my fiancée
don't believe in sin.

240
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:47,913
Are you trying to tell me that dropping
bombs on these Indians...

241
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:49,776
is going to pacify them?

242
00:25:50,985 --> 00:25:52,680
No...

243
00:25:53,721 --> 00:25:56,451
but killing them will.

244
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:04,230
If they hide in the jungle, at least you
bastards can't turn them into beggars.

245
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:06,756
Like that fucking Yoyo.

246
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:10,460
Infecting them with syphilis
and with booze.

247
00:26:11,872 --> 00:26:14,636
Right, Padre?

248
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:20,071
Tell this poor guy how the priest
got massacred by the Niaruna.

249
00:26:20,681 --> 00:26:24,515
That is not such an amusing story.

250
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:28,287
It can be.

251
00:26:29,189 --> 00:26:32,386
You see, first the noble savages...

252
00:26:32,592 --> 00:26:35,493
raped both the nuns.
Okay?

253
00:26:35,695 --> 00:26:40,826
Then when they lifted up the priest's
robes and saw they'd been deceived...

254
00:26:41,568 --> 00:26:44,867
they chopped his head off.

255
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,838
"L'chayim."

256
00:26:49,576 --> 00:26:54,343
We found the body eight days later.

257
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:57,107
- I've written for a replacement.
- Replacement?

258
00:26:57,317 --> 00:27:00,081
Oh, have no fear.

259
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,049
Comandante Guzman prefers
your wealthy mission...

260
00:27:04,257 --> 00:27:06,919
to my humble operation.

261
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:12,155
You abandoned your Niaruna mission.
The Niaruna are no longer you concern.

262
00:27:12,365 --> 00:27:16,631
On the contrary.
All people are my concern.

263
00:27:17,604 --> 00:27:22,268
Even you and your family,
Mr. Quarrier.

264
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:25,910
Good night.

265
00:27:28,415 --> 00:27:31,942
In one or two centuries...

266
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:36,521
everybody will have our colour,
Mr. Moon.

267
00:27:37,657 --> 00:27:41,821
And these Indians you wish to kill...

268
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:46,795
Yet appears you're an
Indian yourself.

269
00:27:50,603 --> 00:27:53,093
How sad.

270
00:27:54,406 --> 00:28:00,140
Does it not strike you as sad?

271
00:29:34,405 --> 00:29:37,397
God, it's like green hell down there.

272
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:42,309
I don't know about you,
but it gives me the creeps.

273
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:09,367
There's the abandoned mission.
We're right on track.

274
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,581
Niaruna.

275
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,295
Sounds like a good Hebrew name.

276
00:32:14,496 --> 00:32:17,590
It's the lost fucking tribe
of Israel, man.

277
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,995
They're Jews, just like me.

278
00:32:21,236 --> 00:32:25,832
It's their turn
to get persecuted now.

279
00:32:26,041 --> 00:32:30,375
In case they forgot what it
as like back in Tel Aviv.

280
00:32:50,632 --> 00:32:53,499
Where are you going?

281
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,904
I'm talking to you, Lewis.

282
00:32:57,106 --> 00:33:00,166
I want my papers back, okay?

283
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:04,176
We got to drop some bombs
in case Guzman counted.

284
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,318
Where are you going, Lewis?

285
00:33:10,819 --> 00:33:14,380
Lewis, where are you going?

286
00:33:15,157 --> 00:33:19,150
Don't you fuck with me, Lewis.
Don't even try it.

287
00:33:32,573 --> 00:33:37,533
We're going back. Now, Lewis.
We are going back.

288
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:45,216
Pull out.

289
00:33:45,486 --> 00:33:47,750
Pull out.

290
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:52,083
Pull out.

291
00:33:54,395 --> 00:33:58,593
Come on.
Pull out, Lewis!

292
00:35:15,976 --> 00:35:17,705
Shit.

293
00:35:17,978 --> 00:35:21,072
You mean the reason we didn't
drop the bombs is because...

294
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:27,277
some nude, fucking aboriginal
who is probably a fucking cannibal...

295
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:31,955
was dumb enough to shoot
an arrow at our plane?

296
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:36,061
A lot of people would say you're
a murdering bastard.

297
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:40,199
- A lot of people would.
- Yeah, a lot of people.

298
00:35:42,969 --> 00:35:44,994
I ain't like you.

299
00:35:45,305 --> 00:35:48,172
I don't have a stinking death wish.

300
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:52,337
Hey, Chief, sorry.
No luck today.

301
00:35:52,546 --> 00:35:54,741
Maybe tomorrow, huh?

302
00:35:55,882 --> 00:36:00,148
Nice country out there.
You're going to love it.

303
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:03,687
We left a few for you.

304
00:37:10,322 --> 00:37:12,552
Did you drink this shit?

305
00:37:12,758 --> 00:37:14,885
Answer me.

306
00:37:16,595 --> 00:37:20,656
Lewis, listen.
It ain't like they're Cheyennes.

307
00:37:20,866 --> 00:37:22,891
It ain't like they're Apache.

308
00:37:23,102 --> 00:37:26,731
They're son of a bitchin'
South Americans.

309
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:30,932
Listen to me,
they're nothing but jungle rats.

310
00:37:31,143 --> 00:37:35,375
Listen. I'm telling Guzman we fly
tomorrow. Do you read me?

311
00:37:35,581 --> 00:37:36,946
Do you read me?

312
00:37:37,149 --> 00:37:41,142
Ten hut! Shit!

313
00:37:42,488 --> 00:37:44,887
You're out of here.

314
00:37:46,057 --> 00:37:48,651
You're out of here, Lewis.

315
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:24,238
November 1-3-Zulu,
do you read me? Over.

316
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:30,209
This is Les Huben, at Mãe de Deus.
Do you read me?

317
00:40:33,824 --> 00:40:39,125
Do you read me? Fuel level in
your aircraft is very critical. Over.

318
00:40:43,032 --> 00:40:47,366
Do you read me, November?
Your fuel level is dangerously low.

319
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:56,167
How about some last rites,
Reverend?

320
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,748
Moon, can you hear me, over?

321
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,647
You are under the effect of a
powerful drug. You are in danger.

322
00:41:07,656 --> 00:41:12,320
You're running out of gas and time.
Where are you? Over.

323
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,828
I'm at play in the fields
of the Lord.

324
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:26,639
At play in the fields of the Lord.

325
00:41:27,176 --> 00:41:30,043
Gimme that.
Chief...

326
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:34,244
Lewis.
I know you can hear me.

327
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:37,613
You get your ass back here
with that plane, now.

328
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:53,898
He's gone.

329
00:42:08,483 --> 00:42:10,451
At play...

330
00:42:11,252 --> 00:42:14,153
Crazy son of a bitch.

331
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:19,053
May God forgive him.

332
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:28,997
We heard...

333
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,227
a terrible thunder.

334
00:47:33,438 --> 00:47:35,963
You fell down from the sky.

335
00:47:36,174 --> 00:47:42,305
Are you the Thunder Spirit?

336
00:47:43,013 --> 00:47:46,005
Are you Kisu?

337
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:03,665
We don't want you here.
Go back where you came from.

338
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:08,861
Go back now.

339
00:48:24,388 --> 00:48:26,686
Aeore, he came from the sky.

340
00:48:26,890 --> 00:48:31,156
I don't care where he came from.
He must leave.

341
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,896
Boronai.

342
00:48:41,438 --> 00:48:44,999
Aeore, don't make him angry.
He can do us harm.

343
00:48:45,208 --> 00:48:50,271
You must leave right now.

344
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:54,541
This is our village.
Get out!

345
00:48:54,751 --> 00:49:00,553
You are Kisu?

346
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:06,595
Moon.

347
00:49:07,096 --> 00:49:08,927
Moon.

348
00:49:09,131 --> 00:49:12,760
He is Kisu Mu from the sky.

349
00:49:17,606 --> 00:49:20,006
Niaruna.

350
00:49:32,154 --> 00:49:36,022
Pindi, quick, bring food.

351
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:45,595
Kisu Mu wants to eat.
Hurry up, you lazy girl.

352
00:57:36,466 --> 00:57:39,060
We are naked and have nothing.

353
00:57:39,268 --> 00:57:41,702
Therefore,
we must decorate ourselves.

354
00:57:45,641 --> 00:57:50,078
Without our paint...

355
00:57:50,279 --> 00:57:55,842
how are we to be different
from animals?

356
00:59:31,346 --> 00:59:33,507
"Adeus".

357
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,313
Under the eyes of God,
we begin our journey.

358
00:59:40,055 --> 00:59:44,082
Hey, preacher.
Hey, preacher.

359
00:59:44,292 --> 00:59:48,228
You see Moon, you tell him I won't
hang around this town forever.

360
00:59:49,097 --> 00:59:52,897
Tell him the old Wolf
has to cover his own ass.

361
01:00:17,859 --> 01:00:20,555
He's letting you steer?

362
01:00:20,762 --> 01:00:23,127
"Hi."

363
01:01:02,803 --> 01:01:07,763
Bring another bottle of booze.

364
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:19,310
- What tribe are they?
- Tiro.

365
01:01:20,087 --> 01:01:23,989
They look nasty, but they've been
pacified for a long time.

366
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:27,425
They're Catholic?

367
01:01:27,628 --> 01:01:29,858
The opposition took advantage.

368
01:01:30,064 --> 01:01:32,089
Anyway, they're a meek
and stupid people.

369
01:01:34,401 --> 01:01:37,268
Then they shall inherit the Earth,
as the Lord Said.

370
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:41,926
We're here now.

371
01:02:42,135 --> 01:02:44,831
We'll be in Remate, here,
by nightfall.

372
01:02:45,037 --> 01:02:48,564
We'll sleep one more night on
the boat, get up at five...

373
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:52,939
and by mid-afternoon tomorrow,
we'll be at the mission.

374
01:02:53,246 --> 01:02:56,977
Will we found our mission
in the exact same place...

375
01:02:57,183 --> 01:02:58,241
where the priest was killed?

376
01:02:58,484 --> 01:03:02,545
Yes, it will show the Indians
we're determined. Which is vital.

377
01:03:02,755 --> 01:03:06,691
Some Niaruna will meet us.
A fellow named Kori and his people.

378
01:03:06,993 --> 01:03:10,451
They're Catholic converts
who are used to whites.

379
01:03:10,997 --> 01:03:13,556
They stayed even after
the Catholics left?

380
01:03:15,867 --> 01:03:19,769
Some of them ran back to their village,
but Kori's people stayed.

381
01:03:19,971 --> 01:03:21,768
That's right.

382
01:03:21,973 --> 01:03:26,569
We'll have to win them over
from the Romans, I guess.

383
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,876
You think they are watching us?

384
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,981
It's possible.
Are you scared?

385
01:04:41,352 --> 01:04:44,788
- You bet. Aren't you?
- Nah.

386
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,924
Maybe your faith
is stronger than mine.

387
01:04:53,130 --> 01:04:55,598
"God's will be done."

388
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:38,741
Stay here, Andy.

389
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:46,079
Come on, Martin.

390
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:51,815
"Kori".

391
01:05:56,894 --> 01:06:00,352
"Kori".

392
01:06:02,265 --> 01:06:05,063
"Kori".

393
01:06:06,736 --> 01:06:09,432
"Kori".

394
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:15,707
Come on, Martin.

395
01:07:15,505 --> 01:07:19,134
We'll have to start all over.

396
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:31,379
Maybe that's for the best.

397
01:07:51,173 --> 01:07:53,801
Hard work.

398
01:07:54,009 --> 01:07:56,239
Hey, boss.

399
01:07:58,447 --> 01:08:01,541
I'm gonna smoke a cigarette.

400
01:08:05,253 --> 01:08:07,551
Father Silva's grave.

401
01:08:07,756 --> 01:08:10,350
There is more important
business to be done.

402
01:08:17,199 --> 01:08:20,862
It's a shame we need an armed guard
to do God's work.

403
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:23,094
You want to end up that way?

404
01:08:28,777 --> 01:08:31,109
"God's will be done."

405
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:55,960
I feel like we're bribing the Indians
to love Jesus.

406
01:08:57,104 --> 01:08:59,538
It's for their own good.

407
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:02,607
It's the first contact that counts.

408
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:05,404
How else they come to us?

409
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:10,816
How else will they learn that
Jesus Christ died for their sins?

410
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:21,225
"Uyuyu, vamos".

411
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:54,753
Lord be praised.
It's Kori. Martin!

412
01:09:54,962 --> 01:09:56,930
It's Kori.
They have come back.

413
01:09:57,131 --> 01:10:01,261
Bring presents and food.
Hurry up!

414
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:05,699
My friends, praise the Lord.

415
01:10:07,308 --> 01:10:11,301
- I come in peace.
- Welcome.

416
01:10:11,879 --> 01:10:16,440
"Please, we need food."

417
01:10:16,649 --> 01:10:20,745
"My people are hungry...

418
01:10:20,954 --> 01:10:22,512
they need clothes."

419
01:10:22,722 --> 01:10:27,921
"Nós temos comida para você
e roupas também."
["We have food and clothing for you]

420
01:10:28,127 --> 01:10:31,858
Bring the stuff, hurry!

421
01:10:45,411 --> 01:10:50,178
"Excuse-me, please".

422
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,988
Andy, bring something
for this lady.

423
01:11:00,193 --> 01:11:05,563
No, it's very bad, very bad.
We don't use it.

424
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:06,852
"Outro lado."
["Other side"]

425
01:12:07,059 --> 01:12:09,027
Praying the Mother of God - 
can you imagine?

426
01:12:09,227 --> 01:12:11,161
We got to get them
to the other side.

427
01:12:11,363 --> 01:12:17,268
"Kori, uma bolacha e também..."

428
01:12:17,469 --> 01:12:22,463
Other side, go on.
This is nuts.

429
01:15:33,396 --> 01:15:38,356
Hazel, come on.
We'll change partners.

430
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,834
- Having a good time?
- I'm having a great time.

431
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:50,308
- How about he little fella?
- He's having fun.

432
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:07,552
Hey, Martin.
Give me my wife back.

433
01:16:07,763 --> 01:16:12,223
- You can't have her.
- You can have yours.

434
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,360
Listen, you're a big boy now.

435
01:16:41,563 --> 01:16:46,523
God is counting on you to help
your mother and father, okay?

436
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,270
I'll miss you.

437
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:59,436
- God bless the Quarrier family.
- God bless you too.

438
01:16:59,648 --> 01:17:01,673
God bless you and keep you.

439
01:17:01,883 --> 01:17:04,181
Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

440
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,684
Have a safe trip back.

441
01:17:21,569 --> 01:17:24,595
God bless the Quarrier family.

442
01:17:24,805 --> 01:17:27,638
God help us.

443
01:17:40,354 --> 01:17:43,289
Son.

444
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:38,945
Verily, verily I say onto thee,
except a man be Born of water...

445
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:41,114
and of the Spirit...

446
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:43,943
he cannot enter
the kingdom of heaven.

447
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:49,053
I baptize you in the name of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

448
01:18:51,624 --> 01:18:55,082
- Alleluia.
- Alleluia.

449
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:19,941
Billy, where are you?

450
01:20:22,748 --> 01:20:25,979
Billy, were you watching this?

451
01:20:26,785 --> 01:20:28,116
Were you?

452
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,914
Come down here right now,
young man!

453
01:20:39,932 --> 01:20:41,797
Look at you.

454
01:20:42,034 --> 01:20:48,064
Were you watching this, this, this...
You look like a demon!

455
01:20:49,942 --> 01:20:53,207
Shame on you!
Get out of here!

456
01:20:53,412 --> 01:20:57,143
Stop this vile, disgusting...
You're sinners!

457
01:20:57,349 --> 01:21:00,318
You are not married.
You sin against God.

458
01:21:00,519 --> 01:21:02,749
- What are you doing?
- They were...

459
01:21:02,955 --> 01:21:08,325
I'm not leaving! These people need
to be disciplined. They are not...

460
01:21:11,029 --> 01:21:15,966
Dad, do the wild ones
know we're here?

461
01:21:18,503 --> 01:21:20,494
They know.

462
01:21:21,306 --> 01:21:23,900
They know all right, son.

463
01:21:24,877 --> 01:21:28,813
Billy... about your mom...

464
01:21:29,548 --> 01:21:32,574
We have to try and be
patient with her.

465
01:21:32,818 --> 01:21:37,345
We have to try and understand her.
This is difficult for her.

466
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:43,918
Dad...
Why were they doing that?

467
01:21:44,128 --> 01:21:47,723
They were grabbing each other.

468
01:22:06,751 --> 01:22:09,311
The next time you strike an Indian...

469
01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,011
for any reason whatsoever...

470
01:22:12,223 --> 01:22:15,659
it's you who will be sent away.

471
01:22:16,394 --> 01:22:19,921
They are different from us,
they don't understand.

472
01:22:20,131 --> 01:22:23,066
It could be dangerous for us all.

473
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:25,258
Billy's seeing these filthy tricks!

474
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:30,930
It won't seem filthy to him
unless we make it so.

475
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:34,441
- It's very natural.
- Natural?

476
01:22:34,645 --> 01:22:37,705
And if one of these nasty little
savages touches him?

477
01:22:38,082 --> 01:22:40,073
He might enjoy it.

478
01:22:42,586 --> 01:22:45,987
Dad, they're here.
The wild ones.

479
01:22:47,158 --> 01:22:49,956
The wild ones?

480
01:22:52,863 --> 01:22:57,232
Come out, don't fear.

481
01:22:57,501 --> 01:23:03,234
Come here. Come.

482
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:07,103
This is my house.

483
01:23:11,948 --> 01:23:16,681
It's good here.

484
01:23:16,886 --> 01:23:21,846
Plenty of food.

485
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:27,621
We don't have to work.
He is a good friend.

486
01:23:27,831 --> 01:23:33,770
He has gifts for you,
you, everybody.

487
01:23:40,643 --> 01:23:45,137
Tell them we have
presents for them.

488
01:23:49,219 --> 01:23:53,212
Kori, can you get them
to lower them?

489
01:24:04,534 --> 01:24:07,367
You got them laughing, son.

490
01:24:10,140 --> 01:24:12,836
You got them laughing, Billy.

491
01:24:34,296 --> 01:24:37,959
You wanna give them their presents?
Go ahead.

492
01:24:39,001 --> 01:24:43,097
Just be careful.
Go ahead. Okay.

493
01:24:44,673 --> 01:24:47,039
Don't be afraid.

494
01:25:04,126 --> 01:25:06,856
Keep passing them out.

495
01:25:11,633 --> 01:25:13,624
Okay, come here, Billy.

496
01:25:16,472 --> 01:25:18,940
Good going.

497
01:26:10,091 --> 01:26:14,926
Moon? Lewis Moon? Moon?

498
01:26:20,635 --> 01:26:24,628
Kisu Mu? Moon?

499
01:26:28,910 --> 01:26:35,577
It's all right. Come on in.
Don't worry. They're friendly.

500
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:41,686
What do you have?
Rice. Good. Thank you.

501
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:44,316
Dad, you found the real ones.

502
01:27:45,552 --> 01:27:47,417
I think they found us.

503
01:27:47,621 --> 01:27:51,682
It's more than Mr. Huben did.

504
01:28:00,734 --> 01:28:03,828
It's okay, honey.

505
01:28:05,205 --> 01:28:07,673
Kori, do something.

506
01:28:13,380 --> 01:28:16,281
It's alright. Just relax.

507
01:28:18,785 --> 01:28:20,912
She just wants your sunglasses.

508
01:28:21,121 --> 01:28:23,749
Don't get mad.

509
01:29:34,259 --> 01:29:36,557
My wife.

510
01:30:04,088 --> 01:30:06,955
Friends.

511
01:30:07,358 --> 01:30:12,227
This is nothing.

512
01:30:12,764 --> 01:30:16,291
No, it's not your fault.

513
01:30:17,668 --> 01:30:20,660
Come back.

514
01:30:39,090 --> 01:30:41,752
Good Lord.

515
01:31:23,180 --> 01:31:28,139
Taweeda, where did you get those
things? It's a white man's stuff.

516
01:31:28,518 --> 01:31:30,645
Take it off right now.

517
01:31:30,854 --> 01:31:34,346
What are you talking about?
This is mine. It makes me beautiful.

518
01:31:34,557 --> 01:31:39,426
I don't want to see you
with these things again.

519
01:31:39,629 --> 01:31:45,363
You broke my necklace.

520
01:31:45,568 --> 01:31:49,129
Aeore, the white man have everything.

521
01:31:49,339 --> 01:31:53,503
Niaruna have nothing.
Their gifts are very good.

522
01:31:54,477 --> 01:31:58,573
Tukanu, the whites give us because
they want our land.

523
01:31:58,782 --> 01:32:00,215
We must give the gifts back.

524
01:32:00,417 --> 01:32:05,377
Tukanu, we must have no contact
with the whites.

525
01:32:05,722 --> 01:32:09,715
We must kill the white man.

526
01:32:11,461 --> 01:32:14,259
No, Aeore.

527
01:32:40,123 --> 01:32:43,251
No gifts.

528
01:32:43,960 --> 01:32:47,123
We must take back the presents.

529
01:32:47,330 --> 01:32:51,790
There are more whites than all
the Forest People together.

530
01:32:53,135 --> 01:32:58,300
If we kill the whites
who brings gifts...

531
01:32:58,507 --> 01:33:02,204
all the Niaruna will be destroyed.

532
01:33:03,112 --> 01:33:06,377
Are you Kisu?

533
01:33:10,819 --> 01:33:13,617
I come from Kisu.

534
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:18,919
If you come from Kisu, you must unite
the people of the Forest.

535
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:24,998
I agree, Aeore.

536
01:33:25,701 --> 01:33:29,193
Kisu Mu will help the people.

537
01:33:57,332 --> 01:34:03,134
In the day of the Ancestors...

538
01:34:03,338 --> 01:34:06,171
there was no death.

539
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:11,403
There were no floods, no scorpions...

540
01:34:12,381 --> 01:34:18,410
no famine and no pain.

541
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:22,578
Jaguar...

542
01:34:22,790 --> 01:34:28,057
was a friend of man
and hunted with him.

543
01:34:33,468 --> 01:34:39,100
Both were creatures of darkness,
for there was no light...

544
01:34:39,307 --> 01:34:45,212
and the Sun lived on the
far side of the world.

545
01:35:58,518 --> 01:36:01,749
Honey, you wet your bed.

546
01:36:01,955 --> 01:36:04,253
Dad, I didn't mean to.

547
01:36:07,527 --> 01:36:10,121
Oh, honey. Can you stand up?

548
01:36:53,940 --> 01:36:57,068
Dad, I'm thirsty.

549
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:03,516
Niaruna Station, come in,
please. Over.

550
01:37:06,852 --> 01:37:12,688
Niaruna Station, do you head me?
Over.

551
01:37:15,928 --> 01:37:21,230
Niaruna Station, this is Mintipo
Station. Do you read me? Over.

552
01:37:24,270 --> 01:37:28,172
This is Niaruna Station.
Over.

553
01:37:28,374 --> 01:37:33,539
Leslie is on his way, but he weather
conditions are extremely bad.

554
01:37:33,746 --> 01:37:37,910
God bless Billy.
God bless you all. Over.

555
01:37:38,450 --> 01:37:42,978
Mintipo Station?
Andy?

556
01:37:44,623 --> 01:37:46,557
Go ahead, Martin.

557
01:37:49,728 --> 01:37:52,925
Tell Leslie to stay where he is.

558
01:37:55,167 --> 01:37:58,193
Billy has blackwater fever.

559
01:37:59,938 --> 01:38:02,065
He will not leave here.

560
01:38:03,108 --> 01:38:06,202
In the name of the Lord, amen.

561
01:38:06,578 --> 01:38:09,046
- Over and out.
- Martin?

562
01:38:10,215 --> 01:38:13,446
What are you doing?
It's all been arranged.

563
01:38:18,657 --> 01:38:21,455
Come pray with me.
Pray with me.

564
01:38:21,660 --> 01:38:23,924
You're insane?
It's just malaria.

565
01:38:24,129 --> 01:38:27,064
It's just a bad case of malaria.

566
01:38:31,469 --> 01:38:34,267
We're leaving this den of Satan.
Get them on the radio.

567
01:38:34,472 --> 01:38:39,205
Do you hear, Mr. Quarrier?

568
01:38:47,852 --> 01:38:50,650
Are you out of your mind?

569
01:38:50,855 --> 01:38:53,585
It's your only begotten son.

570
01:39:05,069 --> 01:39:08,630
Mutu, come on. He has to rest.

571
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,298
No, Dad. Let him stay.

572
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:21,448
What is he saying?
Billy you have to rest.

573
01:39:22,120 --> 01:39:25,681
He wants me to name my enemy.

574
01:39:25,890 --> 01:39:28,984
Enemy? You have no enemy.

575
01:39:35,933 --> 01:39:40,996
He says that if I die, it means that
I have an enemy who must die, too.

576
01:39:45,943 --> 01:39:49,777
His only enemy is the mosquito,
Mutu.

577
01:39:50,515 --> 01:39:53,780
No one must be killed.

578
01:39:54,352 --> 01:39:55,751
Dad?

579
01:39:58,622 --> 01:40:01,921
Am I going to die?

580
01:40:03,527 --> 01:40:05,518
Am I, Dad?

581
01:40:11,868 --> 01:40:13,927
Yes.

582
01:40:16,907 --> 01:40:19,307
You're going to die.

583
01:40:19,509 --> 01:40:22,307
May the Lord curse you,
Martin Quarrier.

584
01:40:22,512 --> 01:40:26,346
No, of course not, honey.
Daddy's only fooling.

585
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:29,018
Tomorrow we'll go down he river
with Mr. Huben.

586
01:40:29,219 --> 01:40:32,882
Then you'll ride on a plane
and you'll be well in no time.

587
01:40:33,089 --> 01:40:36,115
- He's staying here.
- I don't believe this.

588
01:40:36,259 --> 01:40:39,820
This is Billy's home.
The only home he knows.

589
01:40:40,030 --> 01:40:43,431
You're a devil!

590
01:41:02,719 --> 01:41:05,779
You don't know that this
is blackwater fever.

591
01:41:05,989 --> 01:41:09,220
Or even if it is,
that he's dying.

592
01:41:11,261 --> 01:41:15,254
Honey, even the Indians know.

593
01:41:15,465 --> 01:41:20,266
How do they know? They've never
seen blackwater fever in their lives.

594
01:41:20,470 --> 01:41:23,905
They may not know
blackwater fever...

595
01:41:24,106 --> 01:41:27,075
but they know when someone is dying.

596
01:41:28,711 --> 01:41:31,612
Hazel, listen to me.

597
01:41:31,814 --> 01:41:36,808
This thing runs its course
in 24 hours.

598
01:41:37,019 --> 01:41:40,546
We can't get him to a hospital
before that.

599
01:41:40,990 --> 01:41:43,925
And even if we could...

600
01:41:48,063 --> 01:41:50,657
it would be too late.

601
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:56,002
You just have to get a hold
of yourself...

602
01:41:56,205 --> 01:41:59,868
because Billy is dying...

603
01:42:02,378 --> 01:42:06,041
and I think you know
that as well as I do.

604
01:42:12,922 --> 01:42:18,792
Hazel's right, Martin.
I'll take him out when the sun rises.

605
01:42:19,662 --> 01:42:21,857
No, you won't.

606
01:42:23,532 --> 01:42:30,199
He will die peacefully in his own
home where he belongs.

607
01:42:31,607 --> 01:42:34,804
He belongs in South Dakota.

608
01:42:35,411 --> 01:42:38,847
Leslie's come to help
and you're rude to him.

609
01:42:40,015 --> 01:42:43,212
You're a stubborn and wilful man.

610
01:42:43,485 --> 01:42:47,079
May God have mercy on your soul.

611
01:42:49,157 --> 01:42:51,057
Amen.

612
01:43:10,845 --> 01:43:13,780
Leslie, please.

613
01:43:13,982 --> 01:43:16,507
These people love him.
This is their way.

614
01:43:16,718 --> 01:43:18,686
You're not going to...

615
01:43:32,100 --> 01:43:35,433
Dad.

616
01:43:38,306 --> 01:43:40,672
Yes, son?

617
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:45,278
Why did God...?
You wont get mad at me?

618
01:43:45,480 --> 01:43:49,109
We won't get mad at you.

619
01:43:49,317 --> 01:43:52,753
We love you and God loves you.

620
01:43:52,954 --> 01:43:57,516
Then why did God have to go
and make mosquitoes?

621
01:44:27,721 --> 01:44:30,246
"The Lord is my shepherd.

622
01:44:30,457 --> 01:44:33,290
I shall not want.

623
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:38,463
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures...

624
01:44:38,665 --> 01:44:42,658
He leadeth me beside still waters.

625
01:44:43,036 --> 01:44:46,767
He restoreth my soul.

626
01:44:47,507 --> 01:44:52,809
He leadeth me in the paths of
Of righteousness for His namesake.

627
01:44:53,980 --> 01:44:58,280
Yea, though I walk trough the valley
of the shadow and death...

628
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:01,883
I will fear no evil...

629
01:45:02,089 --> 01:45:04,819
for Thou art with me.

630
01:45:05,092 --> 01:45:08,653
Thy rod and Thy staff,
they comfort me.

631
01:46:07,753 --> 01:46:12,349
As it is written: "For Thy sake
we are killed all day long.

632
01:46:12,558 --> 01:46:15,493
We are accounted as sheep
for the slaughter.

633
01:46:15,694 --> 01:46:20,393
Nay, we are more than conquerors.
Through him who saved."

634
01:46:24,236 --> 01:46:26,295
Keep going.

635
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:30,265
Leslie, keep going.

636
01:46:30,476 --> 01:46:32,535
"Verily I say onto you...

637
01:46:32,745 --> 01:46:35,873
except ye be converted and
become as little children...

638
01:46:36,081 --> 01:46:38,845
ye shall not enter into
the kingdom of heaven...

639
01:46:39,051 --> 01:46:43,511
whosoever therefore becomes as
humble as this child...

640
01:46:43,722 --> 01:46:46,555
the same is the greatest in heaven."

641
01:46:46,759 --> 01:46:49,990
You say you have no converts?
Look at them praying.

642
01:46:52,631 --> 01:46:56,658
Behold, the Lord has seen fit to take
our Billy Quarrier...

643
01:46:56,869 --> 01:47:01,328
in order that these poor dark
souls be led into the light.

644
01:47:01,539 --> 01:47:03,530
Let's raise up our voices.

645
01:47:03,942 --> 01:47:07,139
Be not dismayed what e'er betide

646
01:47:07,345 --> 01:47:10,781
God will take care of you

647
01:47:11,182 --> 01:47:14,345
Beneath his wings of love abide

648
01:47:14,552 --> 01:47:17,783
- God will take care of you
- God did not take my son.

649
01:47:20,091 --> 01:47:23,925
Death took my son.
But, if he did...

650
01:47:24,128 --> 01:47:28,827
if God took my son,
the He is not welcome to my son.

651
01:47:29,167 --> 01:47:34,662
Do you understand?
He is not welcome to my son.

652
01:47:37,041 --> 01:47:39,373
May the Lord forgive you.

653
01:47:45,183 --> 01:47:49,381
I'll try to make my own peace
with the Lord, Leslie.

654
01:47:50,521 --> 01:47:52,853
And if I cannot...

655
01:47:54,392 --> 01:47:57,759
well, then I cannot.

656
01:48:50,914 --> 01:48:53,644
Why did they bring back the gifts?

657
01:48:56,219 --> 01:48:59,211
What have you left undone?

658
01:49:04,394 --> 01:49:06,123
I don't know.

659
01:49:08,231 --> 01:49:14,693
I've prayed and prayed and I've
racked my brains, and I don't know.

660
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:21,700
They don't really trust me.

661
01:49:22,279 --> 01:49:26,579
And they sure don't like
what I teach.

662
01:49:33,123 --> 01:49:36,092
What are they doing down there?

663
01:49:38,862 --> 01:49:43,822
I think they are getting ready
to perform a Nipi ceremony.

664
01:49:44,668 --> 01:49:48,331
The character making the noise
I think is Boronai.

665
01:49:48,538 --> 01:49:53,065
He'll go into the spirit world
and seek a vision.

666
01:50:00,783 --> 01:50:02,011
What did he say?

667
01:50:02,218 --> 01:50:05,449
He's saying that the enemy
sent the mosquito.

668
01:50:09,458 --> 01:50:14,987
When Billy's enemy is killed the Billy
will go far away and sleep in peace.

669
01:51:52,093 --> 01:51:56,189
Not one soul in this infernal pack
realizes that...

670
01:51:56,397 --> 01:51:58,695
God loves them.

671
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:01,460
They're as savage now
as they ever were.

672
01:53:07,901 --> 01:53:10,267
Get out.

673
01:53:48,642 --> 01:53:51,941
This night, the Spirits carried me
away into the mountains.

674
01:53:52,145 --> 01:53:56,548
I visited the Spirits of the forest...

675
01:53:57,417 --> 01:54:00,853
of the rivers, of the wild pigs.

676
01:54:01,054 --> 01:54:05,353
All of them witnessed the death
of the child.

677
01:54:05,591 --> 01:54:09,322
They told me who Billy's enemy is.

678
01:54:09,528 --> 01:54:16,195
The enemy is this man
with the bright eyes.

679
01:54:21,874 --> 01:54:26,174
- He's my son.
- Were leaving now.

680
01:54:28,614 --> 01:54:33,677
Hazel, get in the boat right now.

681
01:54:38,291 --> 01:54:40,851
Stay with me, Martin.

682
01:54:46,032 --> 01:54:50,059
Hazel, get going.
Get in the boat.

683
01:54:55,474 --> 01:54:58,170
Are you all right?
Keep going.

684
01:55:00,279 --> 01:55:03,874
Get in.

685
01:55:06,285 --> 01:55:10,813
We came to bring you the most
beautiful story in the world.

686
01:55:11,257 --> 01:55:14,283
The white man will come back...

687
01:55:15,461 --> 01:55:20,558
and kill all the Niaruna.

688
01:55:23,035 --> 01:55:24,696
Martin, what are you doing?

689
01:55:24,904 --> 01:55:30,603
Hazel, go with Leslie.
I'm staying.

690
01:55:32,711 --> 01:55:37,045
Oh, no, you don't.

691
01:55:39,551 --> 01:55:42,952
I stay here with you, Mart Quarrier.

692
01:55:43,154 --> 01:55:45,520
Till death do us part.

693
01:55:45,724 --> 01:55:50,991
The Lord bless His servants.
Praise the Lord!

694
01:56:10,914 --> 01:56:15,476
- When do we go back?
- You're not going. It's dangerous.

695
01:56:15,685 --> 01:56:18,483
I'd be ashamed to stay here.
They need our help.

696
01:56:18,688 --> 01:56:20,280
What else can we do?

697
01:56:20,490 --> 01:56:23,357
I keep in touch with Martin
twice a day.

698
01:56:24,127 --> 01:56:26,925
The mission is empty.
The Indians are gone.

699
01:56:27,297 --> 01:56:29,390
Even Kori?

700
01:56:31,468 --> 01:56:34,460
If only Martin hadn't done
so poorly...

701
01:56:35,205 --> 01:56:37,139
Come in.

702
01:56:41,311 --> 01:56:43,905
What happened?
You were attacked?

703
01:56:44,647 --> 01:56:47,616
It's nothing serious.

704
01:56:47,817 --> 01:56:51,150
Maybe it takes more persuasion
for these Niaruna...

705
01:56:51,354 --> 01:56:55,119
than for the Tiro and Mintipo
to bring them to God.

706
01:56:55,324 --> 01:56:56,916
No, not really.

707
01:56:57,493 --> 01:57:00,621
Keep our agreement,
or I'll be forced...

708
01:57:03,866 --> 01:57:09,862
- Forced to what, Mr. Guzman?
- Amazonia is not the garden of Eden.

709
01:57:10,072 --> 01:57:12,097
People here want progress.

710
01:57:12,307 --> 01:57:16,073
We must face the reality,
now or later.

711
01:57:16,278 --> 01:57:20,942
You promised to pacify
the savages, no?

712
01:57:23,385 --> 01:57:29,290
You told me to convert them,
that's better for everybody, yes?

713
01:57:29,892 --> 01:57:33,885
- Including the Indians.
- But to pacify them without violence...

714
01:57:34,096 --> 01:57:36,963
to make them good citizens,
that takes time.

715
01:57:37,432 --> 01:57:39,195
Time...

716
01:57:39,401 --> 01:57:42,165
it goes fast.

717
01:57:44,573 --> 01:57:47,371
You better hurry, Mr. Huben.

718
01:57:57,085 --> 01:58:00,248
You made a deal with him?

719
01:58:03,458 --> 01:58:04,584
What was it?

720
01:58:06,128 --> 01:58:08,528
He gave us a year
to pacify the Niaruna.

721
01:58:08,730 --> 01:58:12,097
- Then what?
- Then he'd do the job in his own way.

722
01:58:19,206 --> 01:58:23,404
I have other missions to look after.

723
01:58:23,611 --> 01:58:26,375
That's my duty.
I can't risk becoming a martyr.

724
01:58:26,581 --> 01:58:29,345
What about the Quarriers?

725
01:58:31,218 --> 01:58:34,415
I thought the Lord
was on our side...

726
01:58:34,789 --> 01:58:37,223
but when this Indian attacked me...

727
01:58:37,425 --> 01:58:40,258
I cried:
"Lord, why hast Thou forsaken me?"

728
01:58:40,928 --> 01:58:45,058
You don't know what it was like.
I couldn't endure it again.

729
01:58:45,967 --> 01:58:50,233
This is no time to be disloyal.
I need you.

730
01:58:51,205 --> 01:58:53,366
Please.

731
01:58:54,775 --> 01:58:58,802
- You know something, Leslie?
- Don't look at me like that.

732
01:58:59,447 --> 01:59:01,415
You've shrunk.

733
02:00:09,315 --> 02:00:12,807
Mrs. Huben, God bless you.

734
02:00:13,086 --> 02:00:15,577
Please come in.

735
02:00:24,864 --> 02:00:27,298
I've never been in
a Catholic church before.

736
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:30,469
You're most welcome.

737
02:00:39,679 --> 02:00:42,842
You were praying for Billy Quarrier?

738
02:00:43,550 --> 02:00:46,678
Why not?
Also Lewis Moon.

739
02:00:46,886 --> 02:00:51,220
Children and fools, isn't it?

740
02:00:57,497 --> 02:00:59,897
Comandante says that...

741
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:04,127
our mission work is the best way
to civilize the Indians...

742
02:01:05,105 --> 02:01:08,801
that it's the best way
to avoid killing them.

743
02:01:09,575 --> 02:01:11,008
Do you agree?

744
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:15,446
There are many ways
of killing people.

745
02:01:18,450 --> 02:01:21,578
When you contacted the Indians...

746
02:01:21,787 --> 02:01:23,755
did you think of what
would become of them?

747
02:01:27,359 --> 02:01:30,851
If they had the misfortune
to be converted?

748
02:01:32,865 --> 02:01:35,663
Did you think of that?

749
02:01:36,168 --> 02:01:39,626
I understand your question...

750
02:01:40,339 --> 02:01:42,330
but I have no answer.

751
02:01:47,246 --> 02:01:52,115
Forgive me, Padre...

752
02:01:54,086 --> 02:01:57,886
but do you truly believe?

753
02:01:58,690 --> 02:02:00,749
My child...

754
02:02:03,028 --> 02:02:05,496
is that a question...

755
02:02:05,697 --> 02:02:08,632
or a confession?

756
02:02:10,536 --> 02:02:12,401
You see.

757
02:02:13,405 --> 02:02:17,899
I love the church.
And...

758
02:02:18,477 --> 02:02:24,416
a man like myself... I need it.

759
02:02:26,952 --> 02:02:29,512
I need it.

760
02:02:32,890 --> 02:02:35,450
Shall we sing?

761
02:03:15,399 --> 02:03:17,890
Oh, God...

762
02:03:20,071 --> 02:03:22,767
Where are we?

763
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:29,102
Are there no seasons in this place?

764
02:03:33,918 --> 02:03:39,754
Are there no seasons but rain,
and rain and rain?

765
02:03:47,665 --> 02:03:51,123
Are we in hell and just don't know it?

766
02:03:56,073 --> 02:04:00,566
Don't touch me.
You're only comforting yourself.

767
02:04:02,345 --> 02:04:06,179
I can't stand you Christian mercy.

768
02:04:06,383 --> 02:04:10,046
You're a regular little
four-eyed Jesus.

769
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,588
The sociologist...

770
02:04:19,863 --> 02:04:24,061
student of Indian gods and
Indian sluts.

771
02:04:27,103 --> 02:04:31,938
Do you write about your disgusting
wife the way you write about them?

772
02:04:38,882 --> 02:04:42,841
Do something!
Please!

773
02:04:43,053 --> 02:04:46,511
Do anything but for God's sake,
let me know I'm alive!

774
02:04:46,723 --> 02:04:50,159
I cannot talk to you
when you are like this.

775
02:04:51,494 --> 02:04:55,863
I don't know who
I'm talking to anymore.

776
02:05:19,656 --> 02:05:22,453
Martin, please.

777
02:05:25,828 --> 02:05:27,693
Come inside.

778
02:05:30,666 --> 02:05:33,260
I want you to make love to me.

779
02:05:43,679 --> 02:05:46,671
Please, Martin.

780
02:06:02,398 --> 02:06:08,268
The man who killed the
white child has come back.

781
02:06:23,452 --> 02:06:27,445
We need security.
You learned that for yourself.

782
02:06:30,359 --> 02:06:35,888
That's not security.
It's an admission of weakness.

783
02:06:36,098 --> 02:06:40,091
We tried it you way, Martin,
and it didn't work.

784
02:06:46,141 --> 02:06:49,303
I'll go check the racks.

785
02:06:58,486 --> 02:07:03,753
The only time I didn't hate this big,
ugly body of mine...

786
02:07:03,958 --> 02:07:05,789
was when I remembered...

787
02:07:07,395 --> 02:07:13,095
that somewhere inside...
it had to be clean and beautiful.

788
02:07:14,068 --> 02:07:17,128
Or my beautiful Billy
couldn't have come from it.

789
02:07:27,815 --> 02:07:30,511
You shouldn't talk like that.

790
02:07:30,718 --> 02:07:36,088
You have your own special beauty.

791
02:07:36,557 --> 02:07:39,993
I know, I know.

792
02:07:40,194 --> 02:07:43,789
In the eyes of the Lord.

793
02:07:48,402 --> 02:07:54,773
Are you jealous...
because you are barren before God?

794
02:07:56,511 --> 02:07:58,502
Hazel, don't.

795
02:07:58,713 --> 02:08:03,514
You're content that Martin is lusting
after you, I suppose.

796
02:08:05,753 --> 02:08:08,415
Why do you say these things?

797
02:08:11,792 --> 02:08:15,090
Are you saying you're unaware of it?

798
02:08:15,295 --> 02:08:19,959
I mean, what if I told your husband?

799
02:08:21,768 --> 02:08:25,226
- Told him what?
- That...

800
02:08:26,206 --> 02:08:29,607
you don't honour him as you should.

801
02:08:30,744 --> 02:08:34,339
I don't like you, Hazel.
Not when you're like this.

802
02:08:43,423 --> 02:08:46,256
How could anybody like me?

803
02:08:50,330 --> 02:08:55,290
"Patty cake, patty cake,
baker's man..."

804
02:09:23,630 --> 02:09:25,860
Why does it mean?

805
02:09:27,767 --> 02:09:31,066
What do you think it means?

806
02:09:32,105 --> 02:09:35,097
It means: "Go away".

807
02:09:37,376 --> 02:09:40,607
Maybe we should
admit defeat and leave.

808
02:09:40,813 --> 02:09:44,613
Maybe you should.
I'm not leaving, Leslie.

809
02:09:46,252 --> 02:09:48,652
You should know that by now.

810
02:09:48,854 --> 02:09:53,621
Right. Father Silva
was stubborn, too.

811
02:13:00,510 --> 02:13:03,843
Why didn't you scream for help?

812
02:13:04,147 --> 02:13:07,480
I was too afraid, I guess.

813
02:13:08,718 --> 02:13:12,677
You mean you were...

814
02:13:14,124 --> 02:13:16,388
you were naked?

815
02:13:19,129 --> 02:13:23,623
But I wasn't ashamed.

816
02:13:24,801 --> 02:13:27,395
Am I a sinner, Martin?

817
02:13:33,877 --> 02:13:38,644
It was beautiful.
He touched me so gently...

818
02:13:38,849 --> 02:13:42,910
as if he were blind...
and he wanted me.

819
02:13:43,854 --> 02:13:45,412
How do you know?

820
02:13:46,623 --> 02:13:50,525
Martin, don't be such a child.

821
02:13:55,297 --> 02:13:57,128
You didn't...

822
02:14:00,503 --> 02:14:02,198
But I wanted to.

823
02:14:03,372 --> 02:14:09,140
Is that you wanted to know? I never
wanted anything so much in my life.

824
02:14:11,013 --> 02:14:15,541
How it's possible. I mean, an Indian.
That he didn't assault you?

825
02:14:15,784 --> 02:14:18,844
They are not very romantic,
you know...

826
02:14:22,691 --> 02:14:25,251
It was Lewis Moon.

827
02:18:22,595 --> 02:18:25,063
Today we killed two white man
who were living on our river.

828
02:18:25,264 --> 02:18:28,358
We took their things
and burned their hut.

829
02:18:28,567 --> 02:18:34,164
We came to ask you to join us
to fight the invaders.

830
02:18:37,343 --> 02:18:41,746
Let's join our friends.

831
02:19:27,059 --> 02:19:31,654
Aeore, the white man opened
a hole in the earth...

832
02:19:31,863 --> 02:19:36,800
and freed the bad spirit, Xarawa.

833
02:19:37,135 --> 02:19:41,367
Now our people are sick like Boronai.

834
02:19:41,573 --> 02:19:44,736
Our water is poisoned...

835
02:19:44,943 --> 02:19:50,882
all the fish have died and the
animals are frightened away.

836
02:19:51,082 --> 02:19:52,674
The more the white man come,
the more our people die.

837
02:19:53,418 --> 02:19:55,978
The whites came to take our land.

838
02:19:56,187 --> 02:19:59,122
We must kill them...

839
02:20:00,325 --> 02:20:02,054
before they kill all of us.

840
02:20:02,260 --> 02:20:07,789
They must be driven away, that's true.
But they must not be killed.

841
02:20:08,666 --> 02:20:12,762
It was a mistake to kill
those men on the river.

842
02:20:12,971 --> 02:20:15,940
Who are you to say this?

843
02:20:16,241 --> 02:20:18,937
Wait.

844
02:20:20,712 --> 02:20:23,840
Kisu Mu chose me to lead all of us.

845
02:20:24,048 --> 02:20:27,108
We must become a great nation.

846
02:20:27,318 --> 02:20:29,718
Niaruna, Yuri Maha and Mintipo.

847
02:20:29,921 --> 02:20:33,288
All the Forest People must be united.

848
02:20:34,025 --> 02:20:37,517
The whites at the mission
have done us no harm.

849
02:20:38,363 --> 02:20:41,730
They have medicine to cure us.

850
02:21:18,769 --> 02:21:22,830
Martin, Andy.
They're back.

851
02:21:32,015 --> 02:21:34,575
We have gifts for you.

852
02:21:34,785 --> 02:21:37,185
We don't want presents
from the white men.

853
02:21:38,021 --> 02:21:40,581
We don't want you on our land.

854
02:21:40,791 --> 02:21:43,885
We need presents.
Don't go too near.

855
02:21:44,094 --> 02:21:46,585
That's the demon who attacked me.

856
02:21:46,797 --> 02:21:49,027
We the moon is new again,
you must be gone.

857
02:21:49,499 --> 02:21:52,764
I wish to hear these words
from Boronai.

858
02:21:52,970 --> 02:21:57,907
This is what Boronai has said.

859
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:05,642
Well, well...

860
02:22:07,451 --> 02:22:11,217
If it isn't Lewis Moon...

861
02:22:11,755 --> 02:22:15,191
resurrected from the dead.

862
02:22:16,927 --> 02:22:21,295
Look at you, painted like a devil.

863
02:22:21,731 --> 02:22:26,168
This is your doing, isn't, moon?

864
02:22:28,104 --> 02:22:31,562
What are you up to, Moon?

865
02:22:31,774 --> 02:22:34,402
Answer me.

866
02:22:35,745 --> 02:22:36,803
Answer me.

867
02:22:37,013 --> 02:22:38,674
Martin, what are you doing?

868
02:22:38,881 --> 02:22:42,180
You've destroyed
all of my hard work.

869
02:22:42,385 --> 02:22:44,751
My work here cost me my son.

870
02:22:44,954 --> 02:22:47,320
You know better than
to touch an Indian.

871
02:22:47,723 --> 02:22:50,248
Leslie, he's not an Indian.

872
02:22:51,193 --> 02:22:53,957
It's Lewis Moon.

873
02:22:55,431 --> 02:22:58,889
How much medicine do you have?
My people are dying.

874
02:22:59,101 --> 02:23:03,538
- They have no resistance to flu.
- The flu?

875
02:23:04,540 --> 02:23:07,475
How did they?

876
02:23:07,843 --> 02:23:09,674
They got it from me.

877
02:23:14,417 --> 02:23:16,977
What are you talking about?

878
02:24:01,663 --> 02:24:05,656
I don't want to stay here.

879
02:24:05,867 --> 02:24:07,459
They have the medicine.

880
02:24:07,669 --> 02:24:12,197
- I don't like this.
- Just wait.

881
02:24:12,407 --> 02:24:16,002
Even the smell of the whites
makes me sick. Let's go.

882
02:24:23,618 --> 02:24:28,487
Do you except us to help you do the
Devil's work with those poor savages?

883
02:24:28,756 --> 02:24:31,623
You brought that medicine
for those savages.

884
02:24:31,826 --> 02:24:35,785
- Now they need it.
- Well, they can have it.

885
02:24:36,631 --> 02:24:37,928
- I meant...
- You meant...

886
02:24:38,133 --> 02:24:41,261
you're willing to let the tribe
die in Jesus' name.

887
02:24:42,370 --> 02:24:46,397
Martin, this obscene drunkard
dares speak about Jesus.

888
02:24:46,641 --> 02:24:50,042
Those people are dying
and he wants to make deals.

889
02:24:50,245 --> 02:24:52,042
- You go along with that?
- You're not getting any...

890
02:24:52,247 --> 02:24:55,341
Leslie, please!

891
02:24:56,618 --> 02:24:59,280
We can't save their souls
if they're dead.

892
02:25:00,155 --> 02:25:04,216
- Give me the medicine.
- Why?

893
02:25:04,425 --> 02:25:06,689
You're leading these people
into darkness and corruption.

894
02:25:06,895 --> 02:25:11,661
Shit. Just hand over
the goddamned medicine!

895
02:25:12,199 --> 02:25:13,860
Hand it over!
Hand it over!

896
02:25:14,067 --> 02:25:16,763
Moon! I'll give you the medicine!

897
02:25:16,970 --> 02:25:21,304
Let go! Moon!
I'll get you the medicine.

898
02:25:22,476 --> 02:25:24,967
You people better leave here.

899
02:25:26,813 --> 02:25:29,338
- Start with the sulfonamides...
- So long.

900
02:25:29,550 --> 02:25:33,213
If that Aeore had his way,
you'd be dead long ago.

901
02:25:35,989 --> 02:25:39,948
Do you imagine you're
helping these people?

902
02:25:40,260 --> 02:25:44,321
You're not a real Indian
and you never will be!

903
02:25:46,800 --> 02:25:48,700
I'm not taking any chances.

904
02:25:48,902 --> 02:25:52,531
I knew this man was a killer
the minute I saw him.

905
02:25:52,873 --> 02:25:55,774
- What are you doing?
- Calling Guzman.

906
02:25:55,976 --> 02:25:59,468
When did you meet Moon?
And what happened?

907
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:02,808
- Nothing.
- Then how did he catch your flu?

908
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:06,016
How could you look at him
when he was naked?

909
02:26:07,688 --> 02:26:11,852
Why is a white man's nakedness sinful
to look upon when a red man's is not?

910
02:26:12,059 --> 02:26:15,586
It's the lustful intent.
Go to your room.

911
02:26:15,796 --> 02:26:18,924
You're giving Guzman a reason
to come in here shooting.

912
02:26:20,634 --> 02:26:23,228
"God's will be done."
That's why we're here.

913
02:26:23,437 --> 02:26:26,133
We're going to fight Mr. Lewis Moon.

914
02:26:26,340 --> 02:26:30,743
Mãe de Deus, this is
Niaruna Station, over.

915
02:27:22,595 --> 02:27:26,395
Take only one.
Just one.

916
02:27:26,599 --> 02:27:31,730
Until you came, our people
never had this sickness.

917
02:27:32,338 --> 02:27:35,307
I do not trust you.

918
02:27:35,508 --> 02:27:38,409
You speak the white man's language.

919
02:27:58,464 --> 02:28:00,431
"Ave Maria, cheia de graça,
o Senhor é convosco.
["Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee]

920
02:28:00,632 --> 02:28:02,827
Bendita sois vós entre as mulheres,
bendito é o fruto...
[Blessed art thou among women,
and blessed is the fruit ...]

921
02:28:03,034 --> 02:28:06,003
do nosso ventre, Jesus.
Santa Maria, mãe de Deus..."
[thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God ... "]

922
02:28:06,204 --> 02:28:08,331
You're not welcome there.

923
02:28:12,410 --> 02:28:18,178
"Rogai por nós, pecadores. Agora
e na hora da nossa morte, amém".
["Pray for us sinners. Now
and at the hour of our death, Amen"]

924
02:28:24,689 --> 02:28:28,921
I'm not here on a social visit,
Mr. Huben.

925
02:28:30,161 --> 02:28:35,030
You've stolen Uyuyu back, huh?

926
02:28:35,600 --> 02:28:38,797
He simply brought me here.

927
02:28:39,704 --> 02:28:44,073
But what is this Indian we have
fought over? A Protestant?

928
02:28:44,409 --> 02:28:46,400
Do you believe so?

929
02:28:48,313 --> 02:28:50,440
Is he a Catholic?

930
02:28:50,648 --> 02:28:53,617
Is he neither?
Is he both?

931
02:28:54,519 --> 02:28:59,320
Answer me, Mr. Huben.
Do you think he knows the difference?

932
02:29:01,493 --> 02:29:05,827
Do you think he knows the difference?

933
02:29:07,165 --> 02:29:09,531
May I?

934
02:29:42,466 --> 02:29:46,163
Who knows what he might learn...

935
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:49,339
from our poor Indians...

936
02:29:49,540 --> 02:29:53,408
if we were not always
teaching them?

937
02:29:54,211 --> 02:29:58,409
Such an easy people,
light as the air.

938
02:29:58,615 --> 02:30:00,981
Like a leaf, or a cloud.

939
02:30:02,186 --> 02:30:04,711
They not seek for meaning
the way we do.

940
02:30:04,922 --> 02:30:06,719
They just are.

941
02:30:06,924 --> 02:30:09,722
They may be light as air,
but they killed Silva.

942
02:30:13,597 --> 02:30:14,962
Alas...

943
02:30:15,165 --> 02:30:19,864
Christ will never be accepted here.

944
02:30:22,473 --> 02:30:28,275
A pale man from a desert country
where it never rains.

945
02:30:34,451 --> 02:30:36,851
Will you join me?

946
02:30:37,788 --> 02:30:42,725
I have my own provisions.
I can sleep on my canoe.

947
02:30:42,926 --> 02:30:45,622
No, no. You will be
our guest, Padre.

948
02:30:47,364 --> 02:30:49,524
Thank you.

949
02:30:50,500 --> 02:30:54,903
Let's assume this is true.
What will Guzman do?

950
02:30:56,405 --> 02:31:00,000
How do you say?
Exterminate?

951
02:31:03,012 --> 02:31:07,540
That would be a defeat for this
mission. Isn't that what you want?

952
02:31:07,750 --> 02:31:11,550
Not at the expense
of an entire tribe.

953
02:31:11,754 --> 02:31:14,655
The Comandante wouldn't just
annihilate them?

954
02:31:16,425 --> 02:31:19,656
The two man who got killed
were looking for gold.

955
02:31:19,862 --> 02:31:22,660
There is gold in Niaruna land.

956
02:31:26,536 --> 02:31:30,370
Oh, perhaps Guzman forgot to tell you.

957
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:34,606
For the Indians,
this gold is not a blessing.

958
02:31:34,810 --> 02:31:38,678
You seem so resigned.
How can this be stopped?

959
02:31:40,716 --> 02:31:45,153
You go immediately.

960
02:31:45,354 --> 02:31:47,720
Tell Moon they must disappear
into the forest.

961
02:31:47,924 --> 02:31:52,452
If they resist, they will be shot.
Go.

962
02:31:52,895 --> 02:31:55,489
Uyuyu will take you.

963
02:32:10,212 --> 02:32:13,738
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, Hazel.

964
02:32:19,154 --> 02:32:23,352
Everything will go much better
in the States, honey.

965
02:32:24,626 --> 02:32:28,722
Thank you so much.

966
02:32:54,856 --> 02:32:59,020
What did you call me?
You called me a son of a whore?

967
02:32:59,227 --> 02:33:04,028
- You're not going to the Niaruna.
- We're going to the Niaruna.

968
02:33:04,232 --> 02:33:07,531
I'm going.
Now!

969
02:33:14,009 --> 02:33:17,001
If I'm not back by tomorrow,
you better leave.

970
02:34:23,310 --> 02:34:25,107
My glasses.

971
02:34:39,026 --> 02:34:41,893
I need your help.
"Desculpa".
["Sorry"]

972
02:34:42,096 --> 02:34:46,465
I can't find my glasses.
I can't see too well.

973
02:34:49,837 --> 02:34:55,571
Somewhere...
Anywhere...

974
02:34:58,512 --> 02:35:04,108
Oh, God, they could be anywhere.

975
02:35:05,017 --> 02:35:10,455
"Desculpe, não faz mal.
Precisamos ir, vamos?"

976
02:35:10,656 --> 02:35:14,057
We've to go, okay?
Can you lead me?

977
02:35:14,260 --> 02:35:16,125
I need you.

978
02:36:25,464 --> 02:36:27,591
Where is Moon?

979
02:36:27,800 --> 02:36:29,391
What are you doing here?

980
02:36:29,601 --> 02:36:33,628
We gave back your presents.

981
02:36:33,839 --> 02:36:36,706
The village is full of death.

982
02:36:40,612 --> 02:36:44,946
Where are you?

983
02:36:52,791 --> 02:36:55,919
Is that you, Moon?

984
02:37:01,933 --> 02:37:05,164
Is it true that two gold hunters
got killed?

985
02:37:06,571 --> 02:37:09,665
You know this is exactly
what Guzman wanted.

986
02:37:09,875 --> 02:37:13,140
You have to get
these people out of here.

987
02:37:14,312 --> 02:37:17,213
They're too sick to leave.

988
02:37:19,951 --> 02:37:25,548
Oh, when you get back,
give Wolfie my regards.

989
02:37:26,224 --> 02:37:28,590
Tell him to go home.

990
02:37:28,793 --> 02:37:31,591
Tell him maybe I'll see him someday.

991
02:37:45,277 --> 02:37:48,940
Her name was Pindi.
She was my wife.

992
02:37:49,481 --> 02:37:53,246
She had a son.
I think he's mine.

993
02:38:35,225 --> 02:38:38,251
Does he know...

994
02:38:38,462 --> 02:38:40,953
that you're responsible
for his death?

995
02:38:48,205 --> 02:38:51,606
If you'd stayed away from the mission,
this wouldn't have occurred.

996
02:38:52,009 --> 02:38:54,170
I know that.

997
02:42:49,743 --> 02:42:52,735
His spirit has left his body.

998
02:42:54,815 --> 02:42:59,218
When he returns,
he will be the new chief.

999
02:43:35,154 --> 02:43:37,384
How did they come to accept you?

1000
02:43:41,694 --> 02:43:45,061
They thought I was a messenger
from Kisu...

1001
02:43:45,265 --> 02:43:47,790
because I came from the sky,
Kisu's home.

1002
02:43:55,074 --> 02:43:58,532
What kind of god is Kisu to them?

1003
02:43:59,245 --> 02:44:04,080
An evil spirit bringer of floods.

1004
02:44:04,284 --> 02:44:07,651
Very dangerous.
That's why they fear me.

1005
02:44:14,661 --> 02:44:17,391
When I was teaching them about Jesus
they always said...

1006
02:44:17,597 --> 02:44:20,998
"Kisu, Kisu".

1007
02:44:31,411 --> 02:44:34,608
You mean they believe you're Jesus?

1008
02:44:41,154 --> 02:44:44,783
So I taught them that Jesus...

1009
02:44:44,991 --> 02:44:48,620
was their evil spirit.

1010
02:44:54,133 --> 02:44:57,033
Jesus, Kisu.

1011
02:44:57,336 --> 02:44:59,998
What's the difference?

1012
02:45:04,309 --> 02:45:07,335
It's all hocus-pocus...

1013
02:45:07,779 --> 02:45:09,713
isn't, Martin?

1014
02:45:22,794 --> 02:45:27,254
It would have been better for them
to never have known us.

1015
02:45:43,615 --> 02:45:45,845
Go on, get out!

1016
02:46:22,520 --> 02:46:25,887
Where are you, Martin?

1017
02:46:41,238 --> 02:46:47,143
For the last time, Martin.
Answer me!

1018
02:46:55,853 --> 02:47:01,758
"Vamos para o barco".
We're getting out of here.

1019
02:47:31,255 --> 02:47:36,283
The spirits are angry because the
white man has said that Kisu...

1020
02:47:38,729 --> 02:47:42,460
is the only God that Kisu
loves the Niaruna.

1021
02:47:42,766 --> 02:47:47,793
The white man has brought us death.

1022
02:47:48,004 --> 02:47:52,998
The white man is our enemy.

1023
02:47:55,945 --> 02:48:01,850
We will kill the enemy among us.

1024
02:48:06,189 --> 02:48:09,989
Aeore tells you he truth.

1025
02:48:10,226 --> 02:48:13,662
But this man has come
to warm us of danger.

1026
02:48:13,863 --> 02:48:17,526
He does not want your land.

1027
02:48:17,767 --> 02:48:21,134
He is not your enemy.

1028
02:48:21,337 --> 02:48:26,502
I'm Kisu Mu, I am sent by Kisu.
You will obey me.

1029
02:48:26,709 --> 02:48:30,873
But he is a white man,
he must be killed.

1030
02:48:31,080 --> 02:48:33,605
No. Kisu Mu tells the truth.

1031
02:48:33,816 --> 02:48:37,411
No, we must kill the white man.

1032
02:48:46,429 --> 02:48:52,857
If this man is sent by Kisu, seek to
him the way you speak with your God.

1033
02:48:54,304 --> 02:48:56,795
He wants me to pray?

1034
02:49:00,076 --> 02:49:02,442
He wants you to pray to me.

1035
02:49:07,450 --> 02:49:10,817
I can't do that.

1036
02:49:12,921 --> 02:49:15,754
I can only pray to God.

1037
02:49:18,594 --> 02:49:21,722
I will pray for all of us.

1038
02:49:28,537 --> 02:49:30,562
Lord...

1039
02:49:31,607 --> 02:49:36,237
I have been far from you,
now I ask you to come near.

1040
02:49:36,445 --> 02:49:40,506
These people have been much abused
and I have been part of it.

1041
02:49:41,283 --> 02:49:44,116
They are very angry.

1042
02:49:44,553 --> 02:49:47,522
Now I ask you to help...

1043
02:49:47,723 --> 02:49:52,057
You must not do this.

1044
02:49:52,260 --> 02:49:56,697
Do not pray to this man.
He is not a god. Pray to your own god.

1045
02:49:56,898 --> 02:50:00,163
You must not pray to this man.

1046
02:50:00,369 --> 02:50:04,965
Pray to your own gods in your way
but not to this man or to me.

1047
02:50:05,173 --> 02:50:11,806
I said pray to him.

1048
02:50:16,685 --> 02:50:20,177
I won't.
I can't.

1049
02:50:21,523 --> 02:50:25,357
Pray.
You stupid bastard.

1050
02:50:25,560 --> 02:50:29,553
Start praying to me now,
or I'm going to have to kill that man.

1051
02:50:29,765 --> 02:50:33,997
Understand? Pray.

1052
02:50:34,903 --> 02:50:37,871
Pray.

1053
02:51:29,724 --> 02:51:33,285
Why do you tell us to run away?
You should protect us!

1054
02:51:33,761 --> 02:51:37,561
Kill them. Kill the enemy.

1055
02:54:53,024 --> 02:54:55,925
You are not Kisu Mu.

1056
02:54:57,728 --> 02:55:00,458
You're a white man.

1057
02:55:19,283 --> 02:55:22,116
"Since my last missive
to Mission Fields...

1058
02:55:22,320 --> 02:55:26,518
the devil has inflicted a heavy defeat
on our Lord's forces.

1059
02:55:26,724 --> 02:55:31,218
Satan, who never sleeps,
sent an emissary, an outlaw...

1060
02:55:31,429 --> 02:55:32,760
to agitate the Niaruna...

1061
02:55:32,964 --> 02:55:37,560
and cause them to remain in
blackest sin and darkness.

1062
02:55:38,002 --> 02:55:42,132
One day he told us we had to leave
or the Indians would kill us.

1063
02:55:42,340 --> 02:55:47,403
We sent the girls out. Then Martin
Quarrier, not heeding my warning...

1064
02:55:47,611 --> 02:55:51,240
went to the Niarunas
to warn them of danger.

1065
02:55:51,449 --> 02:55:53,974
According to our faithful convert,
Uyuyu...

1066
02:55:54,185 --> 02:55:58,713
Martin was killed by the Niaruna,
just as I had feared.

1067
02:55:59,557 --> 02:56:03,015
The local commandant closed his eyes
when several murderers...

1068
02:56:03,227 --> 02:56:05,127
bombed the village...

1069
02:56:05,329 --> 02:56:09,026
where Martin Quarrier's body
was discovered.

1070
02:56:09,233 --> 02:56:12,100
No further mission work
will be permitted in this land...

1071
02:56:12,303 --> 02:56:14,635
covered by Satan's darkness.

1072
02:56:15,238 --> 02:56:18,332
I surely hope there is better news
in the next missive.

1073
02:56:18,541 --> 02:56:20,975
To Jesus be the glory."
