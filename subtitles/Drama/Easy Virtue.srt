1
00:00:11,352 --> 00:00:14,765
Good evening.
Good evening, good evening.

2
00:00:14,894 --> 00:00:16,517
Hello, chaps.

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,766
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:27,807
Now then, we have a long way to go,
so... er... keep your powder dry.

5
00:00:29,395 --> 00:00:32,428
Righty-ho... settle down, now.

6
00:00:36,978 --> 00:00:39,514
1... 2... 3...

7
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:47,384
# I'm mad about the boy

8
00:00:48,562 --> 00:00:54,476
# I know it's stupid to be
mad about the boy

9
00:00:56,188 --> 00:01:00,680
# I'm so ashamed of it,
but must admit

10
00:01:00,813 --> 00:01:07,770
# The sleepless nights
I've had about the boy

11
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:14,719
# On the silver screen

12
00:01:14,856 --> 00:01:20,888
# He melts my foolish heart
in every single scene

13
00:01:23,023 --> 00:01:25,807
# Although I'm quite aware

14
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:34,307
# That here and there are traces...
of the cad about the boy

15
00:01:37,815 --> 00:01:42,722
# And Lord knows, I'm not a fool girl

16
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:49,514
# I really shouldn't care

17
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:55,388
# Lord knows, I'm not a schoolgirl

18
00:01:55,524 --> 00:02:02,564
# In the flurry of her first affair

19
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:13,643
# Will it ever cloy, this odd diversity
of misery and joy?

20
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:20,397
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

21
00:02:20,526 --> 00:02:27,815
# And all because I'm mad
about the boy

22
00:02:42,694 --> 00:02:47,067
# I'm feeling quite insane
and young again

23
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:52,101
# And all because I'm...

24
00:02:53,403 --> 00:02:59,270
#... mad about the boy #

25
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:18,608
- She's the first lady racer.
- But she didn't actually win.

26
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:23,111
She crossed the line first.
It's so exciting.

27
00:03:23,238 --> 00:03:25,608
Not nearly as exciting
as crossing your mother.

28
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:28,227
I think we can all ignore that.

29
00:03:28,363 --> 00:03:31,396
Oh, what is that man doing?

30
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,107
Jackson!

31
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,395
- Madam?
- What did I tell you?

32
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,738
Put the camellias by the front door
before the guests arrive!

33
00:03:43,864 --> 00:03:45,321
- Furber.
- Madam?

34
00:03:45,447 --> 00:03:49,109
Salvage any of Jackson's appalling
pruning and send it to Mrs Holborough

35
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:54,110
who's kindly offered up a leg of mutton
for dinner, which you'll fetch, Marion.

36
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,237
But Reverend Burton has asked me
to drain the font.

37
00:03:57,365 --> 00:04:00,647
- My hands are clearly full.
- I'll go.

38
00:04:00,781 --> 00:04:04,064
Uncle George has posted
the most grizzly clippings

39
00:04:04,198 --> 00:04:05,905
of the Valentine's Day Massacre!

40
00:04:06,032 --> 00:04:07,276
Hilda.

41
00:04:07,407 --> 00:04:11,981
Seven terrified men cut down
in a hail of automatic gun fire!

42
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:16,358
Made worse by the strays that
came to lap the curdled blood.

43
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:19,939
- Hilda...
- The Devil Dogs! The Hounds of Hell!

44
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:22,823
The leg of lamb! Now.

45
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,569
Why we try and marry her off to gentry
when plainly she'd prefer an undertaker.

46
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,694
Seating. I'm putting Sarah on your left
and Philip on your right,

47
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,492
so please try and make an effort
to be civil.

48
00:04:39,617 --> 00:04:44,239
Right... I shall go and brush up
on my very small talk.

49
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,774
It might be an awkward meal.

50
00:04:47,909 --> 00:04:51,689
For all we know Sarah's grazing
in greener pastures.

51
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:56,863
Whilst your brother sows his wild oats
in the South of France with his floozy?

52
00:04:56,993 --> 00:05:02,148
No. We'll keep the home fires burning
until his highness wanders home.

53
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,075
Hmm. Like father did?

54
00:05:04,202 --> 00:05:06,773
Yes. Like your father did.

55
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:19,323
I've got news, everybody!

56
00:05:20,203 --> 00:05:23,568
- You all right, sir?
- No. Are you?

57
00:05:23,703 --> 00:05:26,487
- Coping, sir.
- Hear, hear. Well done.

58
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,571
Well done? They look like
they're waiting for a firing squad.

59
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:34,076
- Can't you make them more relaxed?
- Last meal and a cigarette, perhaps?

60
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:38,411
I can't believe it. You'll never guess.

61
00:05:38,537 --> 00:05:42,401
Houdini escaped the Chinese water
torture only to die of a burst appendix.

62
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:45,868
How ghastly!
Oh, and Mother's got a telegram.

63
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,408
"Mr and Mrs Whittaker". Your mother.

64
00:05:50,788 --> 00:05:52,862
What's it say, Father?

65
00:05:53,829 --> 00:05:56,116
Perhaps your mother
should read this first.

66
00:05:56,246 --> 00:06:00,987
Oh! That stupid, stupid, stupid boy!

67
00:06:01,121 --> 00:06:04,036
What's happened?
Has there been an accident?

68
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:07,197
- It's John, he's married that f-f-f...
- Francophile?

69
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,735
- F-f-f...
- Photographer?

70
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:12,574
- Pharmacist?
- Why are you smirking?

71
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,869
Deploying a smile. One member
of this family may actually be happy.

72
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:19,694
Don't be absurd! We don't know
anything about this woman. Furber!

73
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:21,537
Furber!

74
00:06:21,664 --> 00:06:24,235
- Oh, not again!
- Madam.

75
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,447
Lord have mercy.

76
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:30,196
Mister John is coming home with his...
with his wife.

77
00:06:30,331 --> 00:06:32,654
Yes. Their bags have just arrived.
Congratulations, Madam.

78
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,654
I'll be the judge of that. Clear up this
mess and get Cook to send up a ham.

79
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:40,784
- This is from Dover. They'll be half way.
- Yes, Furber. Dress the mutton as ham.

80
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:43,072
Very sharp,
don't cut yourself.

81
00:06:43,207 --> 00:06:45,743
John married the floozy.
How exciting!

82
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:03,617
# A room with a view and you

83
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,665
# And no one to worry us

84
00:07:06,792 --> 00:07:12,741
# No one to hurry us through
... this dream we found #

85
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:18,997
There she blows.
Behold the country cottage.

86
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:21,200
Oh, Lord, it's enormous.

87
00:07:21,334 --> 00:07:25,280
So, I lied about gingerbread hedges
and obese little children.

88
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:28,949
- How hard to swim is the moat?
- Smoke and mirrors, darling.

89
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:30,992
Smoke and mirrors.

90
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,240
Oh, by the by, smoking... don't.
Apparently it wilts the azaleas.

91
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:41,038
- That makes no sense. Speak English.
- All will be revealed, darling.

92
00:07:43,127 --> 00:07:47,749
Oh, give me back the wheel of my car.
I'm going back to Detroit!

93
00:07:53,086 --> 00:07:54,993
How romantic!

94
00:07:55,128 --> 00:07:58,292
Here they come! Oh, Furber!

95
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,908
Mister John and his wife
are about to arrive.

96
00:08:01,045 --> 00:08:03,913
- I can't see them.
- Your tunnel vision.

97
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,040
Ooh!

98
00:08:12,504 --> 00:08:15,502
- Smile, Marion.
- I don't feel like smiling.

99
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,205
You're English, dear. Fake it.

100
00:08:26,963 --> 00:08:30,329
The prodigal son returns
in a blaze of gravel.

101
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,750
Father! You shaved.

102
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:38,082
Welcome, Madam.

103
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:40,963
You look gorgeous.

104
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:43,210
It's so lovely to see you.

105
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:50,334
Oh, darling. Sorry, sorry!

106
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:55,495
This is my wife, Larita.

107
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:59,872
Mrs Whittaker, the pleasure is all mine.

108
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,547
Oh, you're American.

109
00:09:01,673 --> 00:09:04,422
- And very welcome. Jim Whittaker.
- This is my father.

110
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:07,167
I fought alongside many
of your countrymen, Larita,

111
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:09,965
and I must say it's an honour
to have a comrade in the family.

112
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,254
Thank you.
I do hope I'm not a disappointment.

113
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:15,835
- Far from it.
- And my two little blisters.

114
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:17,624
Hilda and Marion.

115
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:20,424
Aren't you the woman
who won the Grand Prix?

116
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:22,208
First place, before disqualification.

117
00:09:22,341 --> 00:09:26,335
Apparently you need chest hair
to change gears in Monaco.

118
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:30,377
I saw you in the paper.
I cut your head out. I could just die!

119
00:09:32,217 --> 00:09:36,163
Furber, that suitcase
to the drawing room, and do be careful.

120
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,417
Marion... Golly, you're not a bit
like what we imagined.

121
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,465
Somewhat older, I expect.
Awfully sorry about that.

122
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:47,504
Before the frostbite sets in...

123
00:09:47,634 --> 00:09:51,924
I'm looking forward to getting acquainted
with the mother of my "Panda".

124
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,085
You'll find me quite uncomplicated,
I'm afraid.

125
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:57,209
Oh! What are you doing?

126
00:09:57,343 --> 00:09:59,499
Carrying you over the finish line.

127
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:06,633
Venus de Milo meet my Venus Detroit.

128
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,301
Oh, hello.

129
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:10,750
Mother's turned our old nursery
into a boudoir.

130
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,959
I wouldn't exactly call it a boudoir, Hilda.

131
00:10:13,094 --> 00:10:16,258
Marvellous. All those grubby memories
of Little Johnnie.

132
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:18,460
We had no time
to raid the hothouse.

133
00:10:18,594 --> 00:10:20,834
I only hope we can make you
comfortable.

134
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:24,169
Don't go to any trouble.
We're only staying a few days.

135
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,668
- Aren't we, Johnnie?
- Of course.

136
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:31,090
And for our next surprise...

137
00:10:35,012 --> 00:10:37,880
What on earth is that?

138
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,714
His master's voice!
A wedding gift from us to you all.

139
00:10:41,845 --> 00:10:45,460
How divine! You should've
got married years ago!

140
00:10:45,596 --> 00:10:52,552
#... another June,
another sunny honeymoon

141
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:58,794
# Another season, another reason
for making whoopee... #

142
00:11:00,972 --> 00:11:03,295
Come on, little blister. Twirl for me.

143
00:11:09,347 --> 00:11:14,218
Oh, a Continental education.
Not all of us have been so fortunate.

144
00:11:14,347 --> 00:11:17,511
An emotional depiction of the French
postal service, Mrs Whittaker.

145
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:20,472
Come now, not Mrs Whittaker.
It's "Mother" now.

146
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,465
I don't think we're quite ready
for that yet.

147
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:29,796
Since time is so clearly against us, why
don't you show Larita up to the nursery?

148
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:32,420
Dinner's at 8:00.

149
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,590
- You didn't tell them?
- One bombshell at a time, darling.

150
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:40,262
That's not fair! Your poor mother.
How long are we staying?

151
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:42,298
A few days?

152
00:11:42,432 --> 00:11:47,255
I shoulder the shortcomings of this family
and what do I get in return? A few days!

153
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:50,093
Look at her. What am I supposed
to do with the bauble of a woman?

154
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:52,381
- Hang her?
- I think she's splendid.

155
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:56,095
- Do you, Hilda? Well, we can all relax.
- She's not what I expected.

156
00:11:56,225 --> 00:11:57,966
She's exactly
what I expected.

157
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,548
- Surely not exactly? She wasn't drunk.
- Oh, very funny, Jim.

158
00:12:01,683 --> 00:12:05,298
- Reduce this to the burlesque.
- She looks so expensive!

159
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,887
- Very.
- Hmm. I like her.

160
00:12:08,017 --> 00:12:10,719
Yes, Jim. We all know what you like.

161
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,224
Mother!

162
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:21,630
Oh, we have all been sent
to our "wombs".

163
00:12:23,934 --> 00:12:27,051
- And so toasty.
- Economics in action.

164
00:12:27,185 --> 00:12:30,136
She keeps half the house closed
to save on heating.

165
00:12:30,268 --> 00:12:32,887
That explains the frosty reception.

166
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:36,349
Well, darling. Let me warm you up.

167
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,726
- Well?
- She's lovely, I'm very proud of you.

168
00:13:01,853 --> 00:13:03,678
Thanks, Father.

169
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:07,971
John? How long is a few days?

170
00:13:08,104 --> 00:13:11,185
Mother, Larita and I would like
to find a home in London.

171
00:13:11,312 --> 00:13:15,009
- But this is your home.
- A home of their own.

172
00:13:17,146 --> 00:13:19,432
But Panda, we need you here.

173
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:23,936
Since you went off around the Riviera,
we've had to let go of six more people.

174
00:13:24,063 --> 00:13:26,303
If you'd just listened to me
and taken on some machinery.

175
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:29,851
Wouldn't that be a good idea? I could
run the entire estate single-handedly.

176
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,677
Congratulations on your insight
and your spontaneity.

177
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:37,096
Sarah and Philip are coming to dinner
tonight, and I have got a table plan

178
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,553
that will take the League
of Nations to unravel.

179
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:44,642
- Tonight? That's absolutely splendid!
- Don't be so fickle in your affections.

180
00:13:44,772 --> 00:13:47,059
Sarah might not be
as accommodating as you expect.

181
00:13:47,189 --> 00:13:49,144
Codswallop. She'll be delighted.

182
00:13:49,273 --> 00:13:53,432
If mother was so desperate for her hand
in marriage, she should've asked herself!

183
00:13:53,564 --> 00:13:55,721
Strange as it may seem,
I agree with your sister.

184
00:13:55,856 --> 00:13:57,598
I think you're wrong.

185
00:13:57,731 --> 00:14:01,144
On certain things, yes. Call her.

186
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:02,980
- Really?
- Really.

187
00:14:03,107 --> 00:14:07,350
Really! If Edgar were here,
he'd do the manly thing.

188
00:14:07,482 --> 00:14:09,971
What? Run away?

189
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:15,891
Here they come!

190
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:34,180
And the chequered flag goes to...
Fast work, John!

191
00:14:34,317 --> 00:14:38,476
I should've written, but it happened
so fast, I didn't know where I was.

192
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:40,813
In Larita's arms, it seems.

193
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:44,225
- Please don't be disappointed.
- Of course I'm disappointed.

194
00:14:44,359 --> 00:14:47,274
But tell me you're happy,
and I'll tell you you're forgiven.

195
00:14:47,401 --> 00:14:51,016
# You're the top,
you're Mahatma Gandhi! #

196
00:14:51,151 --> 00:14:53,722
Panda, don't break out
the brandy just yet.

197
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,601
The hell we're not.

198
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:59,811
- Have I missed something?
- Let sleeping cows stand.

199
00:14:59,943 --> 00:15:01,851
Oh, you plonker!

200
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:05,066
Rule one, push sleeping cow.

201
00:15:05,193 --> 00:15:07,599
Rule two, get out of the way.

202
00:15:07,735 --> 00:15:10,306
Rule three, remember rule two.

203
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:13,015
Sarah!
It's so lovely to see you.

204
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:15,439
I hear your poor father
is not having a good day.

205
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:18,140
I'm afraid not. He sends his love.

206
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:21,690
You are a jolly good sport,
turning up like this, that's all I can say.

207
00:15:21,819 --> 00:15:25,066
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
Larita is such a pretty name.

208
00:15:25,195 --> 00:15:28,607
Yes. Excellent for musical comedy.
Hilda!

209
00:15:28,736 --> 00:15:31,853
- I hear the cow's in a terrible way.
- I've sent flowers.

210
00:15:31,987 --> 00:15:34,191
And did she eat them?
Touche!

211
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,145
Good evening to you all.

212
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:39,024
Nobody told me tonight
was fancy dress!

213
00:15:39,154 --> 00:15:42,187
Then why have you come
as the village idiot?

214
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,143
I think I'm snagged.

215
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:48,519
Let me help you with that.

216
00:15:51,238 --> 00:15:52,979
Holy mother!

217
00:15:54,196 --> 00:15:59,399
Panda? You're forgiven... tenfold.

218
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:10,895
Sarah Hurst, I'd like to introduce
my wife, Larita Whittaker.

219
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:14,064
Gosh, I do like the sound of that.

220
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,402
Sarah... finally.

221
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:20,146
- Johnnie talks about you constantly.
- How very annoying for you.

222
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:25,318
- I hope we can be friends.
- We already are. Congratulations.

223
00:16:25,448 --> 00:16:28,446
Er... I'd like to be friends, too.

224
00:16:28,573 --> 00:16:32,235
- Larita, my tiresome brother...
- The dishonourable Philip Hurst.

225
00:16:32,365 --> 00:16:34,770
Charmed, my dear lady.
Indeed.

226
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,312
Philip, won't you escort me in?

227
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,696
Of course,
my beautiful, little Sausage Fingers.

228
00:16:40,824 --> 00:16:43,443
That's whet my appetite.
Shall we adjourn to the dining room?

229
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,565
And toast my beautiful bride.

230
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:48,401
Had we known there was to be
a wedding reception,

231
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,021
we could've lashed out on taffeta!

232
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:54,986
She's a lot like drowning:
quite pleasant once you stop struggling.

233
00:16:55,116 --> 00:16:59,324
So, John, was Larita's
family able to attend the wedding?

234
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:07,735
More cabbage, Madam?

235
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:10,486
There's lots to do, Larita.
You ride, don't you?

236
00:17:10,617 --> 00:17:12,940
Boats, cars or planes?

237
00:17:13,076 --> 00:17:16,524
- No, horses, silly.
- Ah, yes, horses.

238
00:17:16,659 --> 00:17:19,361
Faulty steering and unreliable brakes.

239
00:17:20,701 --> 00:17:22,656
I'm stealing that for Stirrup Cup!

240
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:24,822
- Stirrup what?
- Cup.

241
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:27,700
Every November, Philip and Sarah's
family host the hunt.

242
00:17:27,826 --> 00:17:30,066
Wait until you meet their father,
Lord Hurst, he's terrific.

243
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:34,030
- And Lady Hurst?
- Was terrific, until she... stopped.

244
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,944
- Stopped what?
- Living.

245
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:41,364
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.

246
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:47,198
Between father's polio
and Philip's mania for tipping cows...

247
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:49,283
Can we please just drop the cows?

248
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,900
I think we'll give the fox a break
this year.

249
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:56,409
Oh, no hunt? Mrs Winston gave me
her saddle. I've had a wax.

250
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,408
Your father and I conspired to make
John the Master of the Hunt.

251
00:18:01,537 --> 00:18:04,784
People come from far and wide.
It's such a shame to disappoint them.

252
00:18:04,912 --> 00:18:06,654
Very thoughtful, Mother.

253
00:18:06,787 --> 00:18:09,489
You do hunt,
I take it, Larita?

254
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,702
Hypocrites, gossips
or defenceless animals?

255
00:18:12,829 --> 00:18:14,108
Bravo!

256
00:18:14,246 --> 00:18:16,283
You wouldn't get her to the start.

257
00:18:16,412 --> 00:18:20,027
We have another
conscientious objector, Father.

258
00:18:20,163 --> 00:18:24,406
Company! Do you object to the circus
or the slaughter, Major?

259
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:26,943
I support Sheppard's position
on pacifism.

260
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,943
Good for you.
So, when does the carnage begin?

261
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,742
After the War Widow's Revue,
but before the craft fair,

262
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:36,744
in between the Dog Show and the shoot.

263
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:41,197
Don't forget the highlight. Mother's
Christmas dance is the hot ticket.

264
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:44,494
She's ordered the most exquisite
Japanese lanterns.

265
00:18:44,622 --> 00:18:47,193
- From Japan?
- No, Fortnum & Mason's.

266
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:50,992
Oh, yes.
Prepare for a whirlwind, Larita.

267
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,079
I'm breathless already.

268
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:01,162
I won't make it to Christmas.
You won't need to.

269
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,825
I won't make it to breakfast!
What were we just eating?

270
00:19:03,957 --> 00:19:06,528
The lumpy grey and beige concoction?

271
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:10,789
Oh, yes. That's the word
I was looking for... "greige".

272
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:14,328
Absolutely no idea.
But it is the speciality of the house.

273
00:19:14,457 --> 00:19:17,740
Incoming! Have you met my namesake?
He's very good in bed.

274
00:19:17,874 --> 00:19:20,541
- Shh! They'll hear you.
- I don't care.

275
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:22,289
I do.

276
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,290
I know we need the heat,
but please don't smoke.

277
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,786
Mother's clairvoyant about these things.

278
00:19:28,916 --> 00:19:31,370
She loathes me, Johnnie.

279
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,031
I'm a gold-digger, burrowing in
from the land of opportunists.

280
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,989
Your father's an interesting study,
though.

281
00:19:39,125 --> 00:19:41,199
Quietly sardonic. I like that in a man.

282
00:19:41,334 --> 00:19:44,616
That won't earn you many
brownie points under this roof.

283
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,830
After the Armistice,
Father didn't come straight home.

284
00:19:49,959 --> 00:19:53,372
He caroused around France and Italy,
drinking, having affairs...

285
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,949
A lot of men did similar...
couldn't settle down.

286
00:19:57,085 --> 00:20:00,451
- Why didn't she go after him?
- A question of pride.

287
00:20:00,585 --> 00:20:02,706
He finally just wandered home.

288
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:06,035
Still a bit of a sore point.
We try not to speak about it.

289
00:20:06,169 --> 00:20:07,578
Except in public.

290
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:10,625
You see, she feels
she's missed out on something.

291
00:20:10,752 --> 00:20:13,323
Which means, of course,
she's missed out on everything.

292
00:20:13,461 --> 00:20:16,909
Exactly. The war robbed her
of all her expectations.

293
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:19,746
She takes one look
at a woman like you...

294
00:20:19,878 --> 00:20:23,125
The harlot stealing into the nursery...

295
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,409
The delicious concubine...

296
00:20:25,545 --> 00:20:27,535
...with the delectable ears...

297
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,829
...nose...

298
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:31,836
...neck.

299
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,163
I could just...

300
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,003
...eat you.

301
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:40,534
After that meal I'm not surprised.

302
00:20:48,838 --> 00:20:53,709
# '... I'm mad about the boy!' #

303
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,456
Dear Lord, thank you for bringing
John and his floozy home safely.

304
00:21:48,133 --> 00:21:51,249
'Hmm... John!'

305
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:03,872
- Why is Larita always so late?
- You can't hurry perfection.

306
00:22:04,008 --> 00:22:08,382
- Edgar was never late for a meal.
- He's missed a few lately.

307
00:22:08,509 --> 00:22:12,088
Good morning.
How are we all on this glorious day?

308
00:22:12,217 --> 00:22:15,914
There she is! Morning, darling.

309
00:22:18,884 --> 00:22:21,089
What would Madam like for breakfast?

310
00:22:21,843 --> 00:22:24,876
I think Madam will get more sustenance
from a kipper.

311
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,257
- But it won't be as much fun.
- Aren't you riding with us?

312
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:30,708
Darling, I think it's about high time

313
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:34,789
that your mother and I have
an intimate tete-a-tete.

314
00:22:34,927 --> 00:22:38,375
- Just us girls.
- Lovely.

315
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,916
What a frightening thought.

316
00:22:43,302 --> 00:22:50,508
Two hemispheres under one roof.
Papua New Guinea, India, the Argentine.

317
00:22:54,053 --> 00:22:56,968
I may not have travelled,
but the world has come to me.

318
00:22:57,095 --> 00:23:00,342
Are you coming down with something?

319
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:03,670
Pollen.
But if I hold my breath long enough...

320
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,545
How peculiar.

321
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,965
Which is why we should
get to know one another.

322
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:11,010
- Where does one start?
- Shall I make headway?

323
00:23:11,137 --> 00:23:14,717
I was born in Detroit.
My father worked in the steel plant.

324
00:23:14,846 --> 00:23:17,513
He was one of the first
lured over to Henry Ford.

325
00:23:17,638 --> 00:23:19,628
Ah, hence the love of motoring?

326
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:22,216
Yes, but I also love animals.

327
00:23:22,346 --> 00:23:24,502
I am a city girl.
I take chickens to the vet.

328
00:23:24,638 --> 00:23:26,261
Oh!

329
00:23:26,388 --> 00:23:30,512
You can't be squeamish about livestock
now that you are living in the country.

330
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:32,712
Which was never my intention.

331
00:23:32,847 --> 00:23:35,715
I was happily carving out a niche
for myself on the race circuit

332
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:40,137
when I was unexpectedly flagged down
by someone irresistible.

333
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:45,794
Remarrying was the farthest thing
from my mind.

334
00:23:47,806 --> 00:23:49,512
I see...

335
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,798
May I ask...?

336
00:23:54,723 --> 00:23:58,302
Oh, dead, unfortunately. No children.

337
00:23:58,431 --> 00:24:02,425
Oh...
How disappointing for you.

338
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:04,927
Still, he provided well, though?

339
00:24:05,057 --> 00:24:09,845
Yes, but there were a lot of hidden costs
associated with his passing.

340
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:14,964
Oh, that beautiful motor car... Surely,
you must have independent means?

341
00:24:15,099 --> 00:24:17,801
I'm more than happy
to discuss my means,

342
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,219
but I think you'll be a tad disappointed.

343
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:22,719
The car is my sole source of income.

344
00:24:22,849 --> 00:24:26,013
Which makes living in London
an imperative.

345
00:24:26,141 --> 00:24:28,630
But what will John do in the city?

346
00:24:28,766 --> 00:24:31,136
Work. It's not uncommon.

347
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:32,925
Oh!

348
00:24:34,017 --> 00:24:37,098
John was brought up in the country,
Larita.

349
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:39,346
Where will he work?

350
00:24:39,475 --> 00:24:43,386
Chalk Farm, perhaps?
Or St-Martin-In-The-Fields?

351
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:47,974
I know this is not perfect so that's
why I'm asking for your guidance.

352
00:24:48,101 --> 00:24:51,383
So, please, how can I make this
pleasant for everybody?

353
00:24:51,518 --> 00:24:56,341
Well, erm... wartime experience dictates
that you keep your head down

354
00:24:56,476 --> 00:24:58,432
and you fit in as well as you can.

355
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:03,301
- Oh, there's a war on?
- Oh, no... not necessarily.

356
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:07,391
Australian mimosa. Mmm... beautiful.

357
00:25:08,685 --> 00:25:10,972
Oh...

358
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:20,185
And then the British troops opened fire...
How grizzly!

359
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:23,807
- How'd it go, Mother?
- Oh, marvellous!

360
00:25:23,936 --> 00:25:25,180
Marvellous.

361
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,344
Thanks for the invitation!

362
00:25:41,396 --> 00:25:43,351
Thanks for the invitation!

363
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:46,015
Oh, it's Lord Hurst!

364
00:25:46,146 --> 00:25:49,061
I fear storm clouds are gathering,
Mrs Whit.

365
00:25:49,188 --> 00:25:51,309
Stop being maudlin, Father.

366
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:53,594
- It's the future!
- Spanner!

367
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:58,186
Father, allow me to introduce
Panda's new chauffeuse.

368
00:25:58,313 --> 00:26:01,975
- Lovely La-La-Larita.
- Watch it, Philip.

369
00:26:02,105 --> 00:26:05,471
My son is prone to fabrication,
but I can see on this occasion

370
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:08,307
he has been perfectly frank,
Mrs Whittaker.

371
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:13,433
Yes, that's right.
There are two of us now.

372
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:16,266
No shortage of wits
around here any more.

373
00:26:16,397 --> 00:26:19,929
OK, stand back! I give you, the future!

374
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,391
All right, John.
You can take my baby out for a spin.

375
00:26:29,107 --> 00:26:32,519
Ha-ha! Allergies.
She inflates like a puffer fish.

376
00:26:32,648 --> 00:26:35,184
You just want to squeeze her
until she pops.

377
00:26:35,315 --> 00:26:38,100
#... working at the car wash

378
00:26:42,607 --> 00:26:45,013
# You might not ever strike it rich

379
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:49,731
# But let me tell you,
it's better than digging a ditch

380
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,270
# Working at the car wash!

381
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,102
# Working at the car wash, man

382
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:58,982
# Come on, now, sing it to me

383
00:27:00,025 --> 00:27:02,644
# It's better than digging a ditch... #

384
00:27:14,609 --> 00:27:17,442
The missus is a bit trigger-happy
this week.

385
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,523
Bleeding tinnitus is killing me.

386
00:27:19,651 --> 00:27:23,941
I like the new Mrs Whit. Reminds me
of the old one before the war.

387
00:27:24,068 --> 00:27:27,268
Only more reasonable. You can tell
she's run her own household.

388
00:27:27,401 --> 00:27:29,108
Oh, be silent!

389
00:27:29,235 --> 00:27:33,015
Good morning,
Furber, Jackson, Millie, and...?

390
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,936
Cook, I can't call you a verb.
Your name?

391
00:27:36,777 --> 00:27:38,234
Beatrice.

392
00:27:41,777 --> 00:27:45,818
All right, all right... it's Doris.
Sorry, Madam.

393
00:27:45,944 --> 00:27:48,480
Always wanted to be called Beatrice.

394
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:53,269
Well, Beatrice, would you mind
if I helped myself in the mornings?

395
00:27:53,403 --> 00:27:56,520
I fear I shall be rising later and later.

396
00:27:56,653 --> 00:27:59,142
Well... if it pleases, Mrs Whit.

397
00:28:01,362 --> 00:28:03,234
The point of the bell?

398
00:28:03,362 --> 00:28:06,562
When I ring it, you come to me,
not the other way round!

399
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:09,816
Larita. May I have a word?

400
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,735
Come along!

401
00:28:15,654 --> 00:28:18,569
Would you please refrain
from chatting to the staff?

402
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,445
It's chore enough trying to keep
this motley crew together.

403
00:28:21,571 --> 00:28:25,647
I had a brilliant French maid in Paris.
Perhaps I should send for her?

404
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:28,185
Thank you, no... erm...

405
00:28:28,321 --> 00:28:32,695
I'd prefer to keep English
the first language in this household.

406
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:34,445
Ah, there you are.

407
00:28:34,572 --> 00:28:37,061
I say! Anyone for tennis?

408
00:28:37,197 --> 00:28:38,524
Yes. You!

409
00:28:38,655 --> 00:28:41,061
John, Shackleton wouldn't let
a dog out today!

410
00:28:41,197 --> 00:28:43,271
The fog has lifted
and Whittakers don't do winter.

411
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:46,653
You go ahead, darling.
I'll play with myself.

412
00:28:46,781 --> 00:28:49,898
- No, really. I'm a lot of fun.
- Ooh...

413
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:52,733
John!
It's brass monkeys out here!

414
00:28:56,573 --> 00:29:00,152
Day one of the Antarctic Open.
Mister Whittaker to serve.

415
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,694
- Hole in one!
- Deuce.

416
00:29:05,824 --> 00:29:09,770
I see your pair of deuces
and I raise you a tenner.

417
00:29:09,907 --> 00:29:12,858
The Titanic could have hit that!

418
00:29:12,991 --> 00:29:16,901
Sarah, you're an embarrassment to
the family name. I'll have you killed.

419
00:29:17,033 --> 00:29:20,730
Good God! What's wrong with you?
No! Stop now!

420
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:24,066
- Stop, everybody! Listen!
- Shoot the court jester!

421
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,146
- Nice backhand!
- Is that a backhand compliment?

422
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:31,483
# Mad dogs and Englishmen
go out in the midday sun!

423
00:29:31,617 --> 00:29:35,113
# The Japanese don't care to,
the Chinese wouldn't dare to

424
00:29:35,242 --> 00:29:38,157
# Hindus and Argentines sleep firmly
from twelve to one

425
00:29:38,284 --> 00:29:41,614
# But Englishmen detest a siesta... #

426
00:29:41,742 --> 00:29:45,238
Laurel and Hardy step up
to the crease. The fillies are lining up.

427
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,148
Miss Hilda Whittaker looking most
fetching in her feed bag and bridle!

428
00:29:55,951 --> 00:29:58,108
One woman's heaven...

429
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:01,365
Oh, she's absolutely beautiful.

430
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:07,363
Broken, tarnished
and completely useless.

431
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,701
Things guaranteed
to keep my wife at bay.

432
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:14,534
May I?

433
00:30:14,661 --> 00:30:17,066
If you don't mind
getting your hands dirty.

434
00:30:17,203 --> 00:30:21,031
In Detroit, what we lack in dirt,
we make up for in filth.

435
00:30:21,161 --> 00:30:24,278
Your first husband
from that neck of the woods?

436
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,900
Oh... well, word gets about.

437
00:30:29,203 --> 00:30:31,988
- So where is he now?
- Dead.

438
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:36,034
Cancer.

439
00:30:36,162 --> 00:30:38,485
He was a fair bit older than me.

440
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:42,365
I spent a while playing the unmerry
widow but the black wore thin.

441
00:30:43,246 --> 00:30:46,943
- You didn't care for him, I gather?
- I cared too much.

442
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:50,908
Life was just such an unpleasant
experience for the man, I...

443
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:54,779
I'd be a liar to say I wasn't glad
when he was relieved of it.

444
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:06,738
- When were you last in France?
- Just after the war?

445
00:31:06,872 --> 00:31:08,827
On a personal reconnaissance,

446
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:13,779
trying to ascertain what exactly
all those fine young men had died for.

447
00:31:15,414 --> 00:31:18,163
Apparently, I'm of the romantic
Lost Generation.

448
00:31:19,456 --> 00:31:21,198
What did you lose?

449
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,280
I'm not sure.

450
00:32:22,418 --> 00:32:24,871
Oh, hello... hello.

451
00:32:25,001 --> 00:32:28,830
Who was the tiny tank?
Who's a pretty, little, cheeky chorizo?

452
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:33,575
On bended knees,
please come and play with me.

453
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:35,914
Johnnie dear,
you know how much I love you,

454
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:39,741
so please try to take this
in the best possible light.

455
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,953
I'm getting a machine gun
and mowing down your entire family.

456
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:47,701
That's fairly disappointing. I thought
you and Father were getting along.

457
00:32:47,836 --> 00:32:50,455
Yes, I might spare the men folk.

458
00:32:50,586 --> 00:32:54,283
But it's awfully dispiriting.
We have absolutely no privacy here.

459
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:56,908
I never needed any privacy before.
This is my home.

460
00:32:57,045 --> 00:32:59,747
It's not mine.
And I very much want one.

461
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:06,242
# We're all alone,
no chaperone can get our number

462
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:10,503
# The world's aslumber,
let's misbehave

463
00:33:13,712 --> 00:33:16,415
Timing is everything, you little brute!

464
00:33:16,546 --> 00:33:19,828
Umpire at least. Philip is pining for you.

465
00:33:19,963 --> 00:33:23,873
If I knew you played tennis, I never
would've signed the marriage certificate!

466
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,746
Ow!

467
00:33:39,047 --> 00:33:41,583
Not a bad day for it.

468
00:33:41,714 --> 00:33:43,504
Reading.

469
00:33:43,631 --> 00:33:46,499
My fiance, Edgar,
was always hiding behind books.

470
00:33:46,631 --> 00:33:51,123
Erm... you're needed on the tennis court.
John was just asking after you.

471
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:54,456
Would you like to see
a photo of him... my Edgar?

472
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,833
Poppy!

473
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:02,254
- That's Enrico Caruso.
- Who's dead, I know that...

474
00:34:02,382 --> 00:34:05,830
But if you ignore
the nose and the mouth...

475
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,378
...and the ears...
there's a striking resemblance.

476
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:13,420
I don't actually have a picture of Edgar.

477
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:16,878
Well... mustn't keep you.

478
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:21,048
No, no. Of course. Looking forward
to getting stuck in to a good book.

479
00:34:21,174 --> 00:34:23,212
Poppy!

480
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:26,044
- You haven't seen the beast, have you?
- The dog?

481
00:34:26,175 --> 00:34:28,498
Nope. I haven't.

482
00:34:30,217 --> 00:34:31,674
Poppy!

483
00:34:37,592 --> 00:34:41,088
Oh, poor, poor Poppy. I'm so sorry.

484
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:42,924
Larita!

485
00:34:45,259 --> 00:34:49,798
I've been sent in to badger you.
Please help us make up doubles?

486
00:34:49,926 --> 00:34:54,584
Oh, Hilda, I can't. I'm only good
for the cocktails between sets.

487
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:59,043
- We're between sets now.
- You can't possibly want me on court.

488
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:02,962
Philip! Go get him.

489
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,716
Poppy!

490
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:11,295
Poppy!

491
00:35:11,427 --> 00:35:12,968
Poppy!

492
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:18,336
- What are you doing?
- Reading.

493
00:35:18,469 --> 00:35:21,503
"Sodom and Gomorrah:
A Biblical Story".

494
00:35:21,636 --> 00:35:24,172
Who gave you this filth?

495
00:35:27,762 --> 00:35:30,962
Go and find the dog! Larita!

496
00:35:33,429 --> 00:35:37,375
Please refrain from giving my daughter
pornographic literature.

497
00:35:37,512 --> 00:35:39,005
Yes, yes, of course.

498
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,804
Oh, and I've volunteered you and Hilda

499
00:35:41,929 --> 00:35:45,626
to perform the Dance of the Dying Swan
for the War Widows' Revue.

500
00:35:45,763 --> 00:35:47,588
We're short on numbers.

501
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:50,174
Lovely. Anything to help.

502
00:35:50,304 --> 00:35:51,963
Have you seen the dog?

503
00:35:52,096 --> 00:35:54,253
No. Not recently.

504
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:58,252
Probably out seizing the sunshine
like everyone else.

505
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:04,010
Poppy!

506
00:36:06,555 --> 00:36:08,013
Furber!

507
00:36:12,264 --> 00:36:15,795
Oh, it's you, Madam. I'm sorry.
Can I get you anything?

508
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:19,676
- A shovel.
- Shovel. Of course.

509
00:36:20,389 --> 00:36:22,925
Go and get Philip a hot toddy.

510
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:29,302
- Philip. You look so... so... so...
- The suspense is killing me.

511
00:36:29,432 --> 00:36:31,008
Poppy!

512
00:36:31,723 --> 00:36:34,294
- Oh... sorry.
- It's fine.

513
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,468
Your brother is such
a sharply honed twit.

514
00:36:48,141 --> 00:36:52,763
- Where's our beautiful cougar hiding?
- Under a book, I expect.

515
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:55,593
I wish she wouldn't slack indoors
so much.

516
00:36:55,725 --> 00:36:59,386
Some people would kill
to be indoors with Larita.

517
00:36:59,517 --> 00:37:01,591
She isn't built the same as us.

518
00:37:01,725 --> 00:37:03,680
Still, it is annoying, though.

519
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:06,641
You're such a sport,
always ready for anything.

520
00:37:06,767 --> 00:37:12,716
I haven't got Lari's beauty
or charm or intelligence.

521
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:15,553
- She is clever, isn't she?
- Hmm...

522
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:19,132
Clever... and bored.

523
00:37:19,268 --> 00:37:24,009
I don't understand it. I'm not bored,
you're not bored, nobody else is bored.

524
00:37:24,143 --> 00:37:26,762
Your father is, out of his mind.

525
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:28,801
Father was born bored.

526
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:32,222
If only she made an effort to play along.

527
00:37:32,352 --> 00:37:34,923
Stop being so torturous, Panda.

528
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,596
You had her playing charades last night.
What more do you want?

529
00:37:37,727 --> 00:37:40,761
John! John?

530
00:37:45,811 --> 00:37:50,219
To tell the truth, I never really liked her.
Crabby, snappy, little bitch...

531
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:54,345
I didn't like the dog much, either.

532
00:37:56,436 --> 00:37:59,849
Poor Poppy. Casualty of war.

533
00:38:02,978 --> 00:38:05,432
If I may be so bold, Madam?

534
00:38:05,562 --> 00:38:09,770
These people ride horses.
Lots of horses.

535
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:12,810
It would be advantageous
to do the same.

536
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:17,977
And I thought Detroit was a tough town.

537
00:38:20,896 --> 00:38:27,972
# You do something to me

538
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:35,973
# Something that simply
mystifies me... #

539
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,136
Oh, has your horse run out of gas?

540
00:38:51,398 --> 00:38:53,554
Oh, John, don't hurt it.

541
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:58,726
Far from it. We've got a hunt coming up.
Poor little mite needs a head start.

542
00:39:00,398 --> 00:39:02,354
Go on... run!

543
00:39:05,399 --> 00:39:08,978
So much to learn about each other.

544
00:39:10,732 --> 00:39:15,555
My curriculum vitae. The brook
is the border of Sarah's property.

545
00:39:15,691 --> 00:39:19,981
Mother always imagined
we'd join forces and invade Surrey.

546
00:39:22,191 --> 00:39:25,806
Oh, and how about
those foot soldiers on high?

547
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:30,267
That's Davis, Lord Hurst's man.
And there's Lord Hurst...

548
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,640
Closely followed by my mother-in-law.

549
00:39:32,775 --> 00:39:35,560
I wonder what the devil
they're surveying?

550
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,773
Are you disappointed
you didn't marry Sarah?

551
00:39:41,901 --> 00:39:45,681
Of course not. We've seen each other
naked since we were one.

552
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:49,065
She's part of the... the... the... scenery.

553
00:39:50,359 --> 00:39:52,895
You can hack it a little while longer,
can't you?

554
00:39:53,026 --> 00:39:57,234
How long is a little?
And don't say two weeks again.

555
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,939
Well, there's the War Widows' Revue,
the craft fair...

556
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:02,691
...the hunt.

557
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:06,599
- The memorial service...
- What memorial service?

558
00:40:08,485 --> 00:40:11,898
Friends, we are gathered here today

559
00:40:12,027 --> 00:40:16,021
in remembrance
of our missing friend, Poppy.

560
00:40:16,153 --> 00:40:17,942
Oh, Poppy...

561
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,524
Wherever you have chosen
to sow your seeds,

562
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:25,320
we pray that you are blooming.

563
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:28,112
We pray that you have gone
to a better place.

564
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:31,733
Shame we don't know
exactly where that place is...

565
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:35,393
Anyway, now for a eulogy
from Emily Dickinson, queen of mirth.

566
00:40:37,612 --> 00:40:42,435
"Because I could not stop for death,
he kindly stopped for me.

567
00:40:42,571 --> 00:40:46,481
"The carriage held but just ourselves
and immortality. "

568
00:40:46,613 --> 00:40:51,400
Or maybe the carriage didn't stop
and Poppy got squished.

569
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:53,983
Scraped off the road
and put in a sausage...

570
00:40:54,113 --> 00:40:56,945
Oh, Hilda!

571
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:07,442
Thank you, Mr Gribble.

572
00:41:08,197 --> 00:41:11,777
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

573
00:41:11,906 --> 00:41:16,398
behold Reverend Burton
and Marion Whittaker

574
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:21,686
as they reach for the scissors
in "Samson and Delilah".

575
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,487
Hark! I hear my husband snore!

576
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,114
What the hell happened to Delilah?
Looks like a sock full of oranges.

577
00:41:42,241 --> 00:41:48,522
I'll creep forth on padded foot
and relieve him of his ample follicles.

578
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:15,531
- How hilarious!
- It's meant to be a tragedy!

579
00:42:15,659 --> 00:42:18,065
Then you succeeded
beyond your wildest dreams.

580
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:21,116
Your father seems
to have a fan.

581
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:24,609
Don't read too much into it. She was
a godsend during mother's last months.

582
00:42:24,743 --> 00:42:27,492
Sometimes I wonder where they'd be
without each other.

583
00:42:27,618 --> 00:42:30,107
My ample follicles are in dire need
of a trim.

584
00:42:32,494 --> 00:42:36,239
I wouldn't taunt the artistes,
my little dying swans. You're on next.

585
00:42:36,369 --> 00:42:40,197
I've encouraged my girls to undertake
something a little more contemporary.

586
00:42:40,327 --> 00:42:43,112
Hilda and I seem to have a talent
for the can-can.

587
00:42:43,244 --> 00:42:46,242
The traditional can-can,
performed without underwear?

588
00:42:46,369 --> 00:42:49,817
- Oh, Philip!
- Anything for you, Philip.

589
00:42:49,953 --> 00:42:51,659
Yes, anything.

590
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:54,654
That'll raise a bit more than money
for the war widows.

591
00:42:54,786 --> 00:42:58,235
- I'm doubling my donation.
- Oh, Pinkie.

592
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:00,657
Fans at the ready, gentlemen!

593
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:03,904
All the way from gay Paris,

594
00:43:04,037 --> 00:43:06,952
I give you Miss Hilda Whittaker

595
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:12,199
and, for her debut performance,
Mrs John Whittaker

596
00:43:12,329 --> 00:43:15,493
doing 'The Can-Can'!

597
00:43:15,621 --> 00:43:17,576
Ooh!

598
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,201
Ooh!

599
00:43:37,414 --> 00:43:39,819
Did... did you...?

600
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:47,446
Is it my imagination, or is your daughter
dancing without her scanties?

601
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:12,248
Ow!

602
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,539
Bravo!

603
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:48,740
It's not Lari's fault.
She said it was traditional!

604
00:44:48,876 --> 00:44:51,199
Philip said it, not Larita.
And it was a joke.

605
00:44:51,335 --> 00:44:53,621
Everyone understood that
except Nelly No Knickers here!

606
00:44:53,751 --> 00:44:57,532
Hilda isn't as experienced
as your wife, John. No one is.

607
00:44:57,668 --> 00:45:00,868
If you're not prepared to have a straight
talk to her, then I certainly am.

608
00:45:01,002 --> 00:45:03,039
Don't be ridiculous. You'll lose a finger.

609
00:45:03,169 --> 00:45:07,412
- Lord Hurst will never speak to me.
- Rubbish. I saw you in the back fields.

610
00:45:07,544 --> 00:45:10,293
Preparing the jumps for the hunt!

611
00:45:10,419 --> 00:45:14,164
I'm completely humiliated!
I'll never get a husband now!

612
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,700
After tonight, I'd have thought
they'll be lining up round the block.

613
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:20,000
I hate her! Hate, hate, hate her!

614
00:45:21,753 --> 00:45:25,119
The advance notices
are sensational, Mrs John.

615
00:45:35,545 --> 00:45:40,333
Is it my imagination or is the cutlery
particularly deafening this evening?

616
00:45:40,462 --> 00:45:44,326
I don't know how many times
I have to say this, Hilda. I am sorry.

617
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:48,954
- That's easy for you to say.
- It's surprisingly hard to be easy.

618
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,243
- You're smiling, Jim.
- God forbid, the wind might change.

619
00:45:56,963 --> 00:46:00,543
Hilda, if I had any inkling that you
were going to take me seriously...

620
00:46:00,672 --> 00:46:02,911
You could have made an effort
to enjoy it less.

621
00:46:03,047 --> 00:46:06,626
I had my underpants on.
I was having a grand time.

622
00:46:07,922 --> 00:46:13,125
It's not fair! You've got two husbands,
and I've had none.

623
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:16,171
- Technically, I have one.
- But you've had two.

624
00:46:16,298 --> 00:46:18,751
I've had two shoes
and it's a great deal more practical.

625
00:46:18,881 --> 00:46:22,413
I dare say you've worn down
more soles than that.

626
00:46:25,423 --> 00:46:27,414
John...

627
00:46:27,548 --> 00:46:31,128
Marion, Larita's first husband died
of cancer. Stop being so callous.

628
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:33,924
Oh, I'm sure Marion
can appreciate the pain

629
00:46:34,049 --> 00:46:36,833
of watching a loved one
slip through her fingers.

630
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,956
She's scandalous!

631
00:46:40,299 --> 00:46:43,167
You should hear what they're saying
about her in the village.

632
00:46:43,299 --> 00:46:45,539
Well, let's stop the wagging tongues,
shall we?

633
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:49,122
Is it true you've had
as many lovers as they say?

634
00:46:51,591 --> 00:46:54,791
Of course it's not true, Mrs Whittaker.

635
00:46:54,925 --> 00:46:57,876
Hardly any of them actually loved me.

636
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:03,750
That was uncalled for.
I realise it was a joke, but still...

637
00:47:03,884 --> 00:47:08,043
- You threw me to the wolves in there.
- Marion hardly constitutes wolves.

638
00:47:08,176 --> 00:47:12,216
All right, you threw me to the voles.
Either way, you abandoned me.

639
00:47:12,342 --> 00:47:14,629
Your sisters need to be restrained.

640
00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:19,132
Restrained? Hilda breaks loose once
and she's almost institutionalised.

641
00:47:19,259 --> 00:47:22,044
And poor old Marion...
Edgar drops by for a cup of sugar,

642
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:24,582
and mother has his name
engraved on the family crypt.

643
00:47:24,718 --> 00:47:27,385
- I'm sorry but it really is very funny.
- Hilarious!

644
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,750
Welcome to the petrified circus.

645
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:33,298
Meet the resident contortionist
who can't bend any further.

646
00:47:33,427 --> 00:47:37,551
Then stop. Be yourself.
Let them live in your spell.

647
00:47:37,677 --> 00:47:42,631
# You do that voodoo
that you do so well... #

648
00:47:42,761 --> 00:47:47,086
You're right, of course. I'm a hypocrite,
pretending to be someone I'm not.

649
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:50,052
Especially since it isn't working.

650
00:47:51,011 --> 00:47:54,543
What the devil has that dog dug up?

651
00:47:57,553 --> 00:47:59,627
Pilot, what have you got there?

652
00:48:01,387 --> 00:48:03,757
How could you not tell us?

653
00:48:03,887 --> 00:48:07,335
Marion, it was an accident.
I am walking on eggshells here.

654
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:12,093
And I believe I panicked.
And once again, I'm very, very sorry.

655
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:15,551
How could you do it? How could you?

656
00:48:15,679 --> 00:48:20,502
I imagine she lowered her full weight
onto the Chihuahua beneath her.

657
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:24,462
Marion, please.

658
00:48:24,596 --> 00:48:27,760
John, did you have anything
to do with this?

659
00:48:27,888 --> 00:48:31,799
No. No, I was the sole perpetrator
of Poppy's demise.

660
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:34,881
And ever since
I have been wracked with guilt.

661
00:48:35,389 --> 00:48:39,383
Please, please, please
let me buy you a new dog.

662
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:43,631
You might buy your loved ones
in the United States,

663
00:48:43,764 --> 00:48:46,051
but you can't in the United Kingdom.

664
00:48:46,181 --> 00:48:47,508
How unfortunate.

665
00:48:47,639 --> 00:48:51,420
You could at least show some remorse.

666
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:56,048
I am full of remorse. I just refuse
to invest in amateur theatrics

667
00:48:56,182 --> 00:48:57,805
to convince you of my sincerity.

668
00:48:57,932 --> 00:49:01,132
That's not how I came off
the assembly line. I'm sorry.

669
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:02,971
I can't change.

670
00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:07,424
Not for you...
not for anybody... any more.

671
00:49:10,432 --> 00:49:14,094
And I wouldn't want her
any other way. So...

672
00:49:17,391 --> 00:49:22,214
- Madam, the dog.
- Oh, stay back! Stay back!

673
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,471
I knew it the second
I laid eyes on her. She's a killer.

674
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,756
She sat on poor Poppy deliberately.

675
00:49:30,892 --> 00:49:33,594
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course she didn't.

676
00:49:33,725 --> 00:49:38,134
My brother has married a dog murderer.
She should be put down.

677
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:40,175
Put through a divorce court.

678
00:49:40,309 --> 00:49:42,181
The Lord does not
sanction divorce.

679
00:49:42,309 --> 00:49:45,675
The Lord is Almighty, Marion.
He can sanction anything he likes.

680
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:47,717
The sooner they move out
the better.

681
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:51,548
They move out?
John isn't going anywhere.

682
00:49:51,685 --> 00:49:53,510
Watch and learn.

683
00:49:59,018 --> 00:50:02,301
It's so unfair.
Why can't I have a room like this?

684
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:08,849
I could die of envy!

685
00:50:08,977 --> 00:50:11,431
Laying to rest this tragic incident,

686
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:15,471
we've had this splendid set of rooms
made over for you, haven't we, Jim?

687
00:50:15,603 --> 00:50:18,803
Yes. My wife would like you
to rest in peace.

688
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:22,977
I even had an old friend of Johnnie's
brought down from the attic.

689
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,722
"Old Faithful Awaits
His Master's Return".

690
00:50:25,853 --> 00:50:28,768
I used to sleep under that silly painting.

691
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:31,727
Very comforting, I'm sure,
but we're expected back in Mayfair.

692
00:50:31,854 --> 00:50:34,721
But these are the largest rooms
in the house.

693
00:50:34,854 --> 00:50:36,928
You'll find nothing like it in London.

694
00:50:37,062 --> 00:50:39,136
- She has a point.
- She always does.

695
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:42,434
Sometimes I don't know
why you ever did wander home.

696
00:50:42,562 --> 00:50:44,103
And miss all the fun?

697
00:50:44,729 --> 00:50:47,396
Cook would like to inform you,
Mrs Whittaker, the bird is stuffed.

698
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:49,311
Oh!

699
00:50:49,438 --> 00:50:51,512
What bird, hmm?

700
00:50:51,646 --> 00:50:54,561
Thursday is bubble and squeak.
I hadn't made any arrangements.

701
00:50:54,688 --> 00:50:56,726
Oh, but I have!

702
00:51:02,189 --> 00:51:06,313
In appreciation of your understanding
and for that delicious double bed.

703
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:09,307
We'll think of you every time we use it.

704
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:19,723
- What exactly are we celebrating?
- Thanksgiving.

705
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:21,894
Thanks for what, hmm?

706
00:51:22,023 --> 00:51:25,602
The annihilation
of an entire indigenous people.

707
00:51:25,732 --> 00:51:28,646
A loving union of two great cultures.

708
00:51:28,773 --> 00:51:31,771
- Just like us.
- How transcontinental.

709
00:51:31,899 --> 00:51:34,980
- I can't believe you got into the kitchen.
- Beatrice did put up a fight.

710
00:51:35,107 --> 00:51:38,354
- But technically I outrank her.
- Who's Beatrice?

711
00:51:38,482 --> 00:51:43,898
Your cook. Or now my undercook,
since I'm qualified cordon bleu.

712
00:51:44,024 --> 00:51:46,181
That's a degree.

713
00:51:46,316 --> 00:51:50,890
Furber... take the vegetables down to
the kitchen and tell Cook to cook them.

714
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:55,517
No, Furber, thank you.
I think I'll surprise my alimentary canal.

715
00:51:56,692 --> 00:52:00,188
Mother, if you don't mind, I'm going
to eat my meal before it gets cold.

716
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,354
Furber, I've changed my mind,
bring it back!

717
00:52:02,484 --> 00:52:03,597
Me, too.

718
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:07,641
Gobble, gobble!

719
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:14,358
Yes!

720
00:52:18,318 --> 00:52:19,941
Here's a tip, Hilda.

721
00:52:20,068 --> 00:52:23,516
A sure way to a man's heart is
through his stomach. Or his mother.

722
00:52:23,651 --> 00:52:28,025
Larita, look, I've found
another likeness of Edgar.

723
00:52:28,152 --> 00:52:31,813
- Marion, this is Fatty Arbuckle.
- Who's in jail, I know that.

724
00:52:31,944 --> 00:52:35,274
But if you cut out his cheeks
and give him a bald patch,

725
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,891
there's a striking resemblance...

726
00:52:38,027 --> 00:52:40,942
Edgar's away on a trip
across the pond,

727
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:44,020
sewing his wild oats,
or something agricultural.

728
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:49,557
- She's good, I'll give her that.
- I think you're over-reacting.

729
00:52:56,278 --> 00:52:58,849
Lari? Lari!

730
00:52:59,862 --> 00:53:02,529
Not the vase! Not the vase!

731
00:53:02,654 --> 00:53:06,066
"Taking the corncockle buds
and bee-kissed roses

732
00:53:06,195 --> 00:53:08,270
"roughly in his calloused hands,

733
00:53:08,404 --> 00:53:13,903
"his hot, moist tulip exploded
in her river of delights... "

734
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:26,985
Larita?

735
00:53:27,113 --> 00:53:29,234
Early Christmas present...

736
00:53:29,363 --> 00:53:32,610
- For you, darling.
- Ooh, the mind boggles.

737
00:53:40,447 --> 00:53:41,905
Well, it's... it's...

738
00:53:42,031 --> 00:53:44,022
It's magnificent.
It's monstrous!

739
00:53:44,156 --> 00:53:48,695
It's me. I posed for a young Spaniard.
Don't you absolutely adore it?

740
00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:51,940
Very expressive, darling,
but I can't quite see you in it.

741
00:53:52,073 --> 00:53:53,614
You can see
everything else!

742
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,489
You took your clothes off
in front of a total stranger?

743
00:53:56,615 --> 00:54:00,479
- Of course she took her clothes off.
- I think it's unholy.

744
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:06,114
I'm not sure I approve of you being nude.
You know, without... without me.

745
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,698
Extraordinary.

746
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:11,733
What exactly are you
hoping to achieve?

747
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:14,650
Just trying to get into the swing
of things... Mother.

748
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:20,613
Marvellous! Well, then, you'll be riding
in the hunt with us, won't you?

749
00:54:20,741 --> 00:54:23,775
I might be persuaded
if the painting stays.

750
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:25,650
- Hunt.
- Paint.

751
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:27,525
- Hunt.
- Paint.

752
00:54:27,658 --> 00:54:29,151
Hunt!

753
00:54:29,283 --> 00:54:30,942
Very well.

754
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:34,401
Hunt.

755
00:54:40,201 --> 00:54:42,026
View, hello.

756
00:54:45,284 --> 00:54:48,981
Hello, everyone.
Good to see you. Richard.

757
00:54:49,118 --> 00:54:52,531
Morning, Jim!
After generations of false starts,

758
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:55,279
we've finally managed
to combine our cavalry.

759
00:54:55,410 --> 00:54:58,112
Congratulations.
A marriage of minor convenience.

760
00:54:58,243 --> 00:55:00,068
You'll be fine, I promise.

761
00:55:00,202 --> 00:55:04,859
The second you have the Holborough
boy's eye, flirt outrageously.

762
00:55:04,994 --> 00:55:07,696
But Warwick Holborough has ears
like the Cambridge Cup!

763
00:55:07,827 --> 00:55:13,030
And Philip's the prize. Now, if you want
a man's attention... ignore him.

764
00:55:20,245 --> 00:55:23,492
Warwick the Wingnut
and Sausage Fingers?

765
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:27,863
What a handsome couple.
They'll have puppies not children.

766
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:33,692
Wait... there's something I need to say.

767
00:55:34,829 --> 00:55:38,195
I see you... you're wasted here.

768
00:55:38,329 --> 00:55:42,157
When the time comes... give me a ring.

769
00:55:42,287 --> 00:55:45,239
If I could find your neck, I'd wring it.

770
00:55:45,371 --> 00:55:49,282
- Larita's making sheep's eyes at Philip.
- She's a Venus de Flytrap!

771
00:55:49,413 --> 00:55:53,537
- She wants him all to herself.
- She's not interested in Philip.

772
00:55:53,663 --> 00:55:56,033
- Nobody's interested in Philip.
- I am!

773
00:55:56,997 --> 00:55:58,738
Mount up, Larita.

774
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:02,782
If you don't mind, I think
I might give the fox a head start.

775
00:56:02,914 --> 00:56:05,828
Lari, get on the pony, please.

776
00:56:06,414 --> 00:56:08,570
Oh, it's just as I thought...

777
00:56:08,706 --> 00:56:12,154
Oh, I said I'd ride,
and I'm always good for my word.

778
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:14,408
Tally-ho!

779
00:56:30,332 --> 00:56:34,278
# Spy on me, baby, use satellite

780
00:56:34,415 --> 00:56:38,456
# Infrared to see me
move through the night

781
00:56:38,582 --> 00:56:42,078
# Aim, going to fire, shoot me right

782
00:56:42,207 --> 00:56:46,118
# I'm going to like the way you fight

783
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:50,326
# Now you've found
the secret code I use

784
00:56:50,458 --> 00:56:54,286
# To wash away my lonely blues

785
00:56:54,417 --> 00:57:00,780
# So I can't deny or lie
cos you're the only one to make me fly

786
00:57:01,959 --> 00:57:06,248
# Sex bomb, sex bomb,
you're a sex bomb

787
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:09,658
# You can give it to me
when I need to come along...

788
00:57:09,792 --> 00:57:12,198
What?

789
00:57:12,334 --> 00:57:14,621
# You're my sex bomb... #

790
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:18,081
- What is she doing?
- A victory lap, by the look of things.

791
00:57:19,126 --> 00:57:22,658
There's something wild about that child
that's so contagious.

792
00:57:26,085 --> 00:57:28,241
Whoo-hoo!

793
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:35,501
Well, she promised she'd ride.
Ha-ha!

794
00:57:44,753 --> 00:57:48,367
#... no chaperone
can get our number

795
00:57:48,503 --> 00:57:53,540
# The world's in a slumber,
let's misbehave!

796
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:58,458
# There's something wild
about you, child, that's so contagious

797
00:57:58,587 --> 00:58:03,707
# Let's be outrageous,
let's misbehave!

798
00:58:03,837 --> 00:58:08,578
# When Adam won Eve's hand,
he wouldn't stand for teasin'

799
00:58:08,712 --> 00:58:13,535
# He didn't care about those apples
out of season

800
00:58:13,671 --> 00:58:18,577
# They say that Spring means
just one little thing to little lovebirds

801
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:24,294
# We're not above birds,
let's misbehave... #

802
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:32,165
Whoo!

803
00:58:42,631 --> 00:58:45,298
Miss Hilda,
telephone from New York.

804
00:58:52,881 --> 00:58:54,374
Uncle George?

805
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:57,374
Oh, thank God, a friendly voice.

806
00:58:57,507 --> 00:59:00,624
Yes, and she's a complete nightmare.

807
00:59:03,382 --> 00:59:05,373
Really?

808
00:59:05,507 --> 00:59:07,711
How salacious.

809
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:11,963
Come in.

810
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,340
Mother?

811
00:59:15,716 --> 00:59:18,963
I'd like to apologise
for today's schmozzle.

812
00:59:19,091 --> 00:59:21,378
That really won't be necessary.

813
00:59:21,508 --> 00:59:24,672
Larita made no secret
of her disapproval of blood sports.

814
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,376
She did ride as promised.

815
00:59:26,508 --> 00:59:31,960
Well, we should credit her with her
imaginative way of keeping her word.

816
00:59:32,092 --> 00:59:34,166
You must be very proud of her.

817
00:59:35,217 --> 00:59:37,788
Mother, I think...

818
00:59:37,926 --> 00:59:40,414
I think maybe Larita and I ought to go.

819
00:59:40,551 --> 00:59:42,755
Oh...

820
00:59:42,884 --> 00:59:45,503
Yes, I see. Very well.

821
00:59:45,634 --> 00:59:49,463
Feel free to drop in
whenever it takes your fancy.

822
00:59:49,593 --> 00:59:51,797
- Off you go. Enjoy.
- Don't be like that.

823
00:59:51,926 --> 00:59:54,924
I'm sorry, dear,
wasn't Mummy being kind enough?

824
00:59:55,052 --> 00:59:57,540
Take these, they might get you
as far as Constantinople!

825
00:59:57,677 --> 01:00:00,344
- And this... Casablanca.
- Mother, stop it!

826
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:02,341
No. You stop it!

827
01:00:12,678 --> 01:00:15,166
The money's gone, John.

828
01:00:15,303 --> 01:00:17,258
Nothing left.

829
01:00:17,386 --> 01:00:20,586
The only thing standing
between this family and bankruptcy

830
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,208
are those surveyors in the back field.

831
01:00:24,970 --> 01:00:30,588
Lord Hurst is offering to buy 400 acres
to keep the bailiffs away.

832
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:36,635
It's your legacy, John Whittaker...
and I'm selling it.

833
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:45,878
- I had no idea.
- No... No, you don't.

834
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:54,971
You were supposed to take over
the estate, take your responsibilities.

835
01:00:55,097 --> 01:00:58,095
But you were unexpectedly
flagged down.

836
01:00:59,805 --> 01:01:02,887
I've been struggling for years
with a man who doesn't care,

837
01:01:03,014 --> 01:01:05,218
waiting for you to step up to the mark.

838
01:01:07,722 --> 01:01:10,839
No. You just go.

839
01:01:10,972 --> 01:01:14,338
Go to Algiers
with your racing car driver.

840
01:01:14,473 --> 01:01:17,139
I'm too tired to care any more!

841
01:01:19,306 --> 01:01:23,003
It's not exactly surprising,
John. Look at the grounds.

842
01:01:23,140 --> 01:01:27,596
- Your mother is being very practical.
- In what sense?

843
01:01:27,723 --> 01:01:31,089
You're not coming back.
Your father moved out decades ago.

844
01:01:31,224 --> 01:01:35,218
Philip's not going to marry Hilda.
Nobody's going to marry Marion.

845
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:39,390
Subdividing the land and selling
to a neighbour is an elegant solution.

846
01:01:39,516 --> 01:01:41,174
Somewhat harsh.

847
01:01:42,683 --> 01:01:45,385
I've had my fair share
of selling off my past,

848
01:01:45,516 --> 01:01:49,640
and it is an auction of innocence
that's neither fun nor pretty,

849
01:01:49,766 --> 01:01:53,179
but it is realistic,
something your mother excels in.

850
01:01:53,308 --> 01:01:56,010
But it's my responsibility.

851
01:01:57,433 --> 01:02:00,597
Gracious, how can I have been so blind?

852
01:02:38,977 --> 01:02:42,390
Oh, winter hydrangeas!
How do you do it?

853
01:02:42,519 --> 01:02:47,307
It's a controlled mixture of passion,
persistence and horse manure.

854
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,432
I was hoping to catch a glimpse
of the new bride.

855
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:57,058
Ah! John's wife has very fickle allergies.

856
01:02:57,187 --> 01:03:01,809
- Allergies to what?
- Flowers, Emma. Can you believe it?

857
01:03:01,937 --> 01:03:05,101
That is a strange choice of bed fellow
for this neck of the woods.

858
01:03:05,229 --> 01:03:08,559
You'll just have to make do
with John and Sarah.

859
01:03:08,687 --> 01:03:11,176
It'll be like old times.

860
01:03:11,312 --> 01:03:16,847
# When you're smiling,
the whole world smiles... #

861
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:20,844
Why the big Panda eyes?

862
01:03:22,688 --> 01:03:25,473
I've often meant to ask you something,
but I hadn't the courage.

863
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:27,679
Well, don't then.

864
01:03:27,813 --> 01:03:32,103
Did you think I behaved like a cad,
marrying Larita without telling you?

865
01:03:32,230 --> 01:03:34,221
No, of course not.

866
01:03:34,355 --> 01:03:38,017
You took the opportunity and married
for love. I respect you for it.

867
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:41,513
If we'd have married it would've been
for friendship and convenience.

868
01:03:41,648 --> 01:03:43,768
- Would it?
- Yes!

869
01:03:43,898 --> 01:03:46,386
We knew one another far too well.

870
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:52,472
I want my marriage to be thrilling,
romantic, with passionate love letters.

871
01:03:52,606 --> 01:03:56,268
- I could've written you love letters.
- Well, you didn't, did you?

872
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:58,472
I did love you all the same.

873
01:03:59,857 --> 01:04:01,266
John, stop it.

874
01:04:10,399 --> 01:04:13,397
He's very different
from the man I met in France.

875
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:19,266
The boy. The same, sweet boy.

876
01:04:23,233 --> 01:04:27,772
Is it true what she says?
Are you really selling off the land?

877
01:04:29,359 --> 01:04:33,104
To be perfectly honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

878
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:38,352
But it's your home, it's your community.

879
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:41,439
Doesn't that matter?

880
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:43,144
No.

881
01:04:44,943 --> 01:04:47,064
You're a dark horse.

882
01:04:49,651 --> 01:04:54,558
Have you noticed how few men
of my age there are in this village?

883
01:04:54,693 --> 01:04:57,810
Fourteen years ago,
we all took the King's shilling.

884
01:04:57,943 --> 01:05:00,728
We all signed up together.

885
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:05,814
My brother, friends, staff...

886
01:05:07,277 --> 01:05:12,018
All hunkered down in the front row
of The Great War.

887
01:05:13,361 --> 01:05:16,940
I thought they kept majors
safely behind desks?

888
01:05:17,069 --> 01:05:19,356
Promotion for surviving.

889
01:05:21,195 --> 01:05:25,520
As captain, it was my job
to get them all out of the trenches.

890
01:05:25,653 --> 01:05:29,813
Within the first four minutes
of our first charge...

891
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:34,102
...20,000 men died.

892
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:41,893
In Thorverton, down the road here...

893
01:05:43,029 --> 01:05:45,483
...they were stationed in Morocco.

894
01:05:46,404 --> 01:05:48,893
Their captain bought them all home.

895
01:05:54,822 --> 01:05:57,820
I didn't bring a single man back.

896
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:00,776
This whole village died.

897
01:06:01,739 --> 01:06:05,151
I think there's a glimmer
of life in you yet.

898
01:06:05,281 --> 01:06:10,104
Well, if there is, it has no time for
pet cemeteries and Japanese lanterns.

899
01:06:10,239 --> 01:06:13,687
- Why did you come back?
- I had no choice.

900
01:06:17,198 --> 01:06:21,357
Bonjour, Madame.
Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?

901
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,563
'She came for you?'

902
01:06:34,157 --> 01:06:35,567
Why the lie?

903
01:06:35,699 --> 01:06:39,230
She thought "wandering home"
sounded better.

904
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:44,533
And to be perfectly frank,
I no longer cared.

905
01:06:50,075 --> 01:06:54,779
I hate new games. There are
too many balls, I can't sink anything.

906
01:06:54,908 --> 01:06:58,985
- Sink some gin, Sausage Fingers!
- I never, ever win.

907
01:06:59,117 --> 01:07:01,108
Oh, well done!

908
01:07:07,242 --> 01:07:10,857
Stop sucking it. Come and help.
Come on, Pops.

909
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,323
All right, Missie,
hold your horses.

910
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:16,856
Right, clear the decks, puppies.

911
01:07:16,993 --> 01:07:18,818
May I?

912
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,649
I was hoping to have a word.

913
01:07:28,785 --> 01:07:32,945
We're accentuating the positive today,
I don't have a mind for anything else.

914
01:07:33,077 --> 01:07:35,032
Of course... of course.

915
01:07:36,536 --> 01:07:39,202
I know you are
under considerable stress...

916
01:07:40,994 --> 01:07:42,866
Regarding what?

917
01:07:44,536 --> 01:07:47,949
Lord Hurst's kind offer
to buy into your property.

918
01:07:48,078 --> 01:07:52,072
The realtor I'm dealing with in London
also specialises in subdivision.

919
01:07:52,203 --> 01:07:56,695
Perhaps he could help negotiate
a premium price.

920
01:07:56,828 --> 01:08:00,360
Thank you, but really this is
of no concern of yours.

921
01:08:00,495 --> 01:08:04,738
Of course it's a concern. I am a member
of this family now and I'd like to help.

922
01:08:04,871 --> 01:08:08,034
And this is your interpretation
of "help", is it?

923
01:08:08,162 --> 01:08:11,528
Carving up our heritage and selling it off
to the highest bidder?

924
01:08:11,663 --> 01:08:14,234
Coming from a country no older
than the chair you are sitting in,

925
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:16,409
it seems a very practical solution.

926
01:08:16,538 --> 01:08:19,157
Just forget the seven
generations of people

927
01:08:19,288 --> 01:08:23,033
who have devoted their entire lives
to farming this land.

928
01:08:23,163 --> 01:08:26,327
Get someone else to do it.
With a machine, no less.

929
01:08:27,372 --> 01:08:29,446
Who do you think you are?

930
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:34,444
Swinging your wherewithal
like a cat on heat.

931
01:08:35,914 --> 01:08:39,410
If you really want to be
of assistance, Larita,

932
01:08:39,539 --> 01:08:42,110
I think you know what's required.

933
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:46,285
Right...

934
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:50,243
I think it's time an expert showed you
how this game is played.

935
01:08:50,373 --> 01:08:52,364
Watch it...

936
01:08:52,498 --> 01:08:53,956
Bravo!

937
01:08:55,373 --> 01:08:59,319
What a sportswoman, I must say.
Can you imagine? Fantastic!

938
01:09:01,499 --> 01:09:03,573
'Lari, you're confusing me. '

939
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:06,705
- 'I'm feeling trapped. '
- 'I don't understand. '

940
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:09,996
It's this house!
It has an air of doom hanging over it.

941
01:09:10,124 --> 01:09:13,241
And I can barely stand the weight
much longer.

942
01:09:18,916 --> 01:09:21,784
The answer is to go abroad again.

943
01:09:21,916 --> 01:09:26,491
Not yet. This is my life for now,
you know that.

944
01:09:26,625 --> 01:09:29,872
- And what part do I play in it?
- Do you have to be so loud?

945
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,785
Of course I do! I'm American.

946
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:43,165
What is the use of bickering like this?
It doesn't lead anywhere.

947
01:09:43,293 --> 01:09:46,244
You never know.
It might lead to a natural end.

948
01:09:47,876 --> 01:09:49,997
Do you want it to?

949
01:09:51,126 --> 01:09:53,366
Do you?

950
01:09:53,502 --> 01:09:54,959
No!

951
01:09:55,793 --> 01:09:58,910
I just want some peace and quiet.

952
01:09:59,044 --> 01:10:01,828
You're far too young
to make a remark like that.

953
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:04,034
I can't help my age...

954
01:10:05,336 --> 01:10:07,243
...Grandma.

955
01:10:10,127 --> 01:10:15,662
Look, I'm sorry that I leave you alone
so much. Honestly, I'm sorry.

956
01:10:18,170 --> 01:10:21,666
Good. Then let's do something about it.

957
01:10:27,045 --> 01:10:29,498
Why are we driving so fast?

958
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:31,703
The thrill of escape!

959
01:10:36,629 --> 01:10:40,042
You're looking very game today.
Fairest game in the land.

960
01:10:41,588 --> 01:10:43,246
A penny for your thoughts?

961
01:10:43,379 --> 01:10:46,082
It's more than pennies,
I'm afraid, Pinkie.

962
01:10:46,213 --> 01:10:48,666
I don't think I can afford the party
this year.

963
01:10:48,796 --> 01:10:51,415
- But the Japanese lanterns!
- No, cancelled.

964
01:10:51,546 --> 01:10:54,414
Had to choose,
Japanese lanterns or the maid.

965
01:10:54,547 --> 01:10:59,784
You're not getting out of it that easily.
My offer of cellar and staff still stands.

966
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:03,453
It wouldn't be Christmas
without your knees-up.

967
01:11:13,964 --> 01:11:19,464
Oh! This is the first piece of clarity
I've had since arriving. Whoo!

968
01:11:23,090 --> 01:11:26,752
Why can't we live in moments
like these forever?

969
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:28,754
Why?

970
01:11:28,882 --> 01:11:32,248
Because you've stopped
loving me, my darling!

971
01:11:32,382 --> 01:11:34,420
How can you say that?

972
01:11:34,549 --> 01:11:37,547
Oh, I just open my mouth
and the words come out.

973
01:11:38,466 --> 01:11:40,670
Then let's make a fresh start.

974
01:11:56,050 --> 01:12:00,957
There are so many things I need
to tell you about me. Hard things.

975
01:12:01,092 --> 01:12:02,882
I don't care.

976
01:12:03,009 --> 01:12:04,881
I do.

977
01:12:05,009 --> 01:12:09,382
It doesn't matter.
I trust you absolutely.

978
01:12:09,842 --> 01:12:19,466
# I'll see you again
whenever Spring breaks through again...

979
01:12:19,593 --> 01:12:20,872
Come on.

980
01:12:21,718 --> 01:12:26,008
# Time may lie heavy between

981
01:12:26,843 --> 01:12:33,753
# But what has been
is past forgetting

982
01:12:33,885 --> 01:12:38,875
# This sweet memory

983
01:12:39,011 --> 01:12:45,458
# Throughout my life will come to me

984
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:50,086
# Though the world may go awry... #

985
01:12:52,595 --> 01:12:53,839
Shot!

986
01:13:01,929 --> 01:13:03,386
John!

987
01:13:07,054 --> 01:13:10,384
- Top hole.
- Oh!

988
01:13:10,513 --> 01:13:13,760
I can't decide which is worse,
that you had to sneak outside

989
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:16,672
to get some privacy,
or that you were caught by Veronica.

990
01:13:16,805 --> 01:13:18,630
Who's Veronica?

991
01:13:18,763 --> 01:13:21,003
I am. It's my name.

992
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:27,676
- I fail to see the humour in it!
- No, darling, you're quite right.

993
01:13:27,805 --> 01:13:31,171
I can certainly see the serious
implications. It's not a laughing matter.

994
01:13:31,305 --> 01:13:33,177
It's only a laughing matter.

995
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:37,169
Indecent exposure is illegal.
Even in America.

996
01:13:37,306 --> 01:13:39,380
Yep, yep...

997
01:13:39,514 --> 01:13:42,085
You're right.
And we're very, very sorry, aren't we?

998
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:46,512
- No, I'm not. This is my husband.
- And this is my home!

999
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,128
Maybe it's time for them
to fly the nest?

1000
01:13:49,265 --> 01:13:53,128
Certainly not. They will stay put
and brazen this out.

1001
01:13:53,265 --> 01:13:56,263
And you can get that ghastly painting
out of my house!

1002
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:59,258
We do not need any more reminders
of your easy virtue!

1003
01:14:09,557 --> 01:14:12,093
- Excited, Furber?
- Overwhelmed, sir.

1004
01:14:12,224 --> 01:14:16,799
- Miss Hilda...
- Uncle George... How explosive!

1005
01:14:16,933 --> 01:14:19,635
Furber, I recognise that as asparagus.

1006
01:14:19,766 --> 01:14:21,638
Correct, Madam.

1007
01:14:21,766 --> 01:14:25,346
- Ha! I pity poor Panda.
- Oh, what is it now?

1008
01:14:25,475 --> 01:14:30,631
Read! "The Detroit News".
Uncle George is a super sleuth!

1009
01:14:30,767 --> 01:14:34,180
Collecting old newspapers is
the last refuge of a truly boring man.

1010
01:14:34,309 --> 01:14:38,433
Boring? Far from it. It was a scandal!

1011
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:41,261
Wasn't it... Mrs Morley?

1012
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,676
Mrs Tom Morley of Detroit, Michigan.

1013
01:14:45,809 --> 01:14:48,014
Don't be grotesque, Hilda.

1014
01:14:48,143 --> 01:14:52,635
Well, I suppose I'd better finish
my meal before it wilts entirely.

1015
01:14:52,768 --> 01:14:55,221
- Any dressing?
- Oh, I am genuinely shocked!

1016
01:14:55,352 --> 01:14:59,049
- No thanks, I always end up wearing it.
- We've been hoodwinked!

1017
01:14:59,185 --> 01:15:01,591
- Especially that runny vinaigrette.
- Fire and brimstone!

1018
01:15:01,727 --> 01:15:03,682
Mayonnaise has more ballast.

1019
01:15:03,810 --> 01:15:07,176
Will you stop this insulting behaviour
immediately?

1020
01:15:12,936 --> 01:15:15,057
Oh, I always hated that photo of myself.

1021
01:15:15,186 --> 01:15:19,262
Of everything I ever
expected, nothing prepared me for this.

1022
01:15:19,395 --> 01:15:22,062
- For what?
- She was charged with murder.

1023
01:15:22,187 --> 01:15:24,675
- I was acquitted.
- And that's consolation?

1024
01:15:24,812 --> 01:15:28,260
- I told you my husband died.
- But you didn't tell us how, did you?

1025
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:30,386
Does John know about this?

1026
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:32,843
- I see...
- It's no concern of ours.

1027
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:35,598
Father! Really!

1028
01:15:35,729 --> 01:15:38,597
Yes, and after Hilda went
to all that trouble digging it up.

1029
01:15:38,729 --> 01:15:41,182
I'm going outside for a cigarette.
Care to join me?

1030
01:15:41,313 --> 01:15:44,227
Thank you, Jim. Don't mind if I do.

1031
01:15:45,980 --> 01:15:47,686
No concern?

1032
01:15:53,022 --> 01:15:55,096
The pack's closing.

1033
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:58,394
This woman has taken advantage
of our son!

1034
01:15:58,522 --> 01:16:00,559
He'd never have married her
if he'd known.

1035
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:03,557
- You know that, do you?
- You'd have preferred we had an affair?

1036
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:06,770
- It would've been more appropriate!
- Mother!

1037
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:10,974
- Unfortunately, I agree with you!
- It's easy to talk like this now.

1038
01:16:11,106 --> 01:16:15,182
It isn't easy, it's heartbreaking.
I love John, but it's not blind love.

1039
01:16:16,690 --> 01:16:19,641
Marion, does that sound
indicate contempt or asthma?

1040
01:16:19,773 --> 01:16:22,096
You can't palm us off like that,
Mrs Morley.

1041
01:16:22,232 --> 01:16:24,306
This is your doing.
You're a bigger fool than you look.

1042
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:26,514
Larita is your type,
isn't she, Father?

1043
01:16:26,648 --> 01:16:29,184
That is the nicest thing
any of you have ever said.

1044
01:16:29,315 --> 01:16:31,851
Hello, are we having a picnic?

1045
01:16:33,524 --> 01:16:39,189
John... I think your wife better unveil
this one herself. Don't you, Larita?

1046
01:16:42,899 --> 01:16:44,440
Before we met...

1047
01:16:45,524 --> 01:16:49,649
...I was involved in a court case
over the death of my husband.

1048
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:52,098
It was seedy and stressful,

1049
01:16:52,233 --> 01:16:55,148
but since I was found innocent

1050
01:16:55,275 --> 01:16:58,392
I didn't think it necessary
to burden you with the details.

1051
01:16:58,525 --> 01:16:59,804
Innocent?

1052
01:16:59,942 --> 01:17:02,857
She was responsible
for a man killing himself!

1053
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:06,599
The verdict was suicide
but that's not where it started.

1054
01:17:06,734 --> 01:17:08,524
I thought it was cancer.

1055
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:10,815
It was...

1056
01:17:10,943 --> 01:17:13,478
But he was so desperately sick.

1057
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:16,810
If you'd known him, you would've
understood how forgivable it was.

1058
01:17:16,943 --> 01:17:19,396
- It's not as if she poisoned him.
- That's what everyone thinks.

1059
01:17:19,526 --> 01:17:21,932
- She's a black widow.
- I pity you, Marion.

1060
01:17:22,068 --> 01:17:24,272
Really? Well, I won't let you!

1061
01:17:24,402 --> 01:17:28,775
Right, that's it! You have a dance
to organise, I suggest you all get to it!

1062
01:17:28,902 --> 01:17:30,560
Now!

1063
01:17:34,486 --> 01:17:37,057
Hilda! Come on, inside!

1064
01:17:39,402 --> 01:17:41,228
John...

1065
01:18:06,654 --> 01:18:09,771
Are you crying
because you're angry or ashamed?

1066
01:18:11,904 --> 01:18:13,397
Neither.

1067
01:18:15,071 --> 01:18:19,528
Coming here has been the most
demoralising experience of my life.

1068
01:18:24,738 --> 01:18:27,820
Why didn't you tell me?

1069
01:18:27,947 --> 01:18:30,482
I wanted to,
everything just happened so fast.

1070
01:18:30,614 --> 01:18:32,770
That's not good enough.

1071
01:18:34,114 --> 01:18:36,982
I tried to, several times.

1072
01:18:38,781 --> 01:18:42,691
But you trusted me... "absolutely".

1073
01:18:44,698 --> 01:18:48,644
And you saw the field day
those fatuous hypocrites made of it.

1074
01:18:48,781 --> 01:18:50,772
Please remember they're my family.

1075
01:18:50,906 --> 01:18:53,477
I shouldn't think of them at all
if they weren't.

1076
01:18:53,615 --> 01:18:57,940
Still... you should have told me.

1077
01:18:59,532 --> 01:19:01,606
You should have loved me more.

1078
01:19:03,699 --> 01:19:05,855
I couldn't love you any more.

1079
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:08,562
You should have loved me better.

1080
01:19:11,699 --> 01:19:13,986
I don't understand you, Larita.

1081
01:19:16,075 --> 01:19:18,610
I don't understand you at all.

1082
01:19:39,909 --> 01:19:44,366
1... 2... 3... Are you all left feet?

1083
01:19:44,493 --> 01:19:48,569
Dancing with you
is like trying to move a piano.

1084
01:19:48,701 --> 01:19:51,071
I wonder what the American
will be wearing.

1085
01:19:51,202 --> 01:19:53,441
Or who she'll be poisoning!

1086
01:19:56,243 --> 01:19:59,656
Do you like long, moonlit walks?

1087
01:19:59,785 --> 01:20:02,356
Only when taken by people
who annoy me.

1088
01:20:02,494 --> 01:20:06,488
You've got me all to yourself.
Larita's upstairs with a headache.

1089
01:20:06,619 --> 01:20:09,949
And which little fool, pray tell,
gave her that?

1090
01:20:27,204 --> 01:20:30,783
- You ought to see if Larita is coping.
- I already have. She's fine.

1091
01:20:30,912 --> 01:20:34,527
It's been a very trying day
for her, John.

1092
01:20:34,662 --> 01:20:37,660
- Go and escort your wife down.
- No, I wouldn't worry.

1093
01:20:37,787 --> 01:20:41,568
You know my wife, she'll make
an entrance when she's ready.

1094
01:20:46,663 --> 01:20:48,488
Come in.

1095
01:20:51,163 --> 01:20:54,197
Quickly, you'll blow my cover.

1096
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,699
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1097
01:21:04,831 --> 01:21:06,786
Watching.

1098
01:21:08,372 --> 01:21:11,536
People are so universally similar
when their guard is down.

1099
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:14,947
Oh, hello! Ha-ha!

1100
01:21:18,081 --> 01:21:22,241
It seems they are universally similar
when their guard is up, as well.

1101
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:26,747
May I?

1102
01:21:28,790 --> 01:21:33,080
- Thank you for being gallant today.
- You are damn cool in a crisis.

1103
01:21:34,499 --> 01:21:37,699
The judge at my trial
said something similar.

1104
01:21:39,874 --> 01:21:42,031
Why did you do it?

1105
01:21:44,583 --> 01:21:47,036
Why did you marry John?

1106
01:21:48,583 --> 01:21:52,245
My first husband was older,
and his end was messy.

1107
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:56,496
Long afterwards, this...

1108
01:21:58,125 --> 01:21:59,452
...boy...

1109
01:21:59,584 --> 01:22:04,739
...this pure boy arrived
fresh and unblemished.

1110
01:22:07,959 --> 01:22:11,372
I married him because
any other relationship seemed...

1111
01:22:12,251 --> 01:22:15,036
...cheap and squalid.

1112
01:22:16,835 --> 01:22:21,327
My first marriage cost me my youth,
and here I am stealing someone else's.

1113
01:22:23,377 --> 01:22:25,035
What will you do?

1114
01:22:27,127 --> 01:22:29,331
The best I can.

1115
01:22:35,377 --> 01:22:36,657
Oh, Davis, thank you.

1116
01:22:38,419 --> 01:22:41,583
- And thank you, Pinkie.
- No, not at all, my dear.

1117
01:22:41,711 --> 01:22:44,330
- Just look at this turnout.
- Hmm...

1118
01:22:44,461 --> 01:22:49,119
They've only come for a repeat
performance of the Cincinnati succubus.

1119
01:22:49,253 --> 01:22:51,623
May I have the pleasure?

1120
01:23:25,505 --> 01:23:26,702
Oh, look!

1121
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:49,294
- Tango, please.
- Certainly. Tango...

1122
01:23:57,215 --> 01:23:59,964
Dance with me, John.

1123
01:24:01,465 --> 01:24:03,622
Lari, don't.

1124
01:24:03,757 --> 01:24:07,205
Please? Dance with me.

1125
01:24:49,135 --> 01:24:51,623
That was very gallant.

1126
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,921
- You've got to stop them, Mother.
- No, I don't.

1127
01:26:24,807 --> 01:26:27,924
Oh, marvellous! Marvellous!

1128
01:26:29,724 --> 01:26:33,006
Straight from the bordellos
of Buenos Aires

1129
01:26:33,141 --> 01:26:36,506
to the Hippodrome of London, Maestro,
take it away!

1130
01:26:38,141 --> 01:26:41,471
Jim, this is the end.

1131
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,257
Congratulations, Madam.

1132
01:26:54,392 --> 01:26:58,137
- Have you been drinking, Furber?
- Yes, Madam. Prodigiously.

1133
01:26:58,267 --> 01:27:00,969
- You are full of surprises.
- Oh, yes, Madam.

1134
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:03,175
I was even arrested once.

1135
01:27:03,309 --> 01:27:05,216
- What for?
- Bigamy.

1136
01:27:13,643 --> 01:27:16,641
Ah, there you are,
Pinkie, I've found you.

1137
01:27:27,435 --> 01:27:29,556
Larita, where are you going?

1138
01:27:29,685 --> 01:27:32,553
Away, Sarah. For John's sake.

1139
01:27:32,686 --> 01:27:34,427
Far, far away.

1140
01:27:35,561 --> 01:27:37,682
Is there anything I can do?

1141
01:27:37,811 --> 01:27:40,181
You can look after him.

1142
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:43,973
Women like me are tiresome in love.
We expect too much.

1143
01:27:45,853 --> 01:27:49,633
Marry John. It's the way things
always should've been.

1144
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:54,474
- I'm just so sorry I got in the way.
- You love him that much?

1145
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:03,474
Go. I'll cover for you.

1146
01:28:03,604 --> 01:28:05,310
Sweet Sarah.

1147
01:28:05,437 --> 01:28:08,684
So glad you've recovered
from your headache.

1148
01:28:08,813 --> 01:28:11,764
Please don't build any convenient
social lies on my behalf.

1149
01:28:11,896 --> 01:28:16,470
- I say, Mother is only...
- Fighting to keep the charade alive?

1150
01:28:16,605 --> 01:28:19,970
You've shown tremendous fortitude
holding this family together, Veronica,

1151
01:28:20,105 --> 01:28:21,895
and I can respect that.

1152
01:28:22,022 --> 01:28:26,726
What I can't respect is the manipulative
road you've chosen to maintain control.

1153
01:28:26,855 --> 01:28:30,138
This war is over. Move on.

1154
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:32,808
"Move on. " Oh, how convenient.

1155
01:28:32,939 --> 01:28:37,312
Oh, wake up, Marion.
Edgar's not coming back.

1156
01:28:37,439 --> 01:28:39,560
And that ring isn't stuck, you are.

1157
01:28:39,689 --> 01:28:44,311
And Hilda, you've got such promise,
yet you're squandering it on malice.

1158
01:28:44,440 --> 01:28:46,347
My advice to both you girls?

1159
01:28:47,273 --> 01:28:51,137
Run! Go see the world
through your own eyes.

1160
01:28:52,773 --> 01:28:56,353
So speaks the siren,
leading the sailors to their death.

1161
01:28:56,482 --> 01:28:59,729
At least I'm not Medusa,
turning them to stone.

1162
01:28:59,857 --> 01:29:03,981
- Get out!
- Larita? Lari?

1163
01:29:04,857 --> 01:29:07,809
- Lari, don't go.
- John, I have to.

1164
01:29:07,941 --> 01:29:11,389
I can't live here. Nothing can.

1165
01:29:11,524 --> 01:29:15,056
But you're my wife, and I love you.

1166
01:29:16,441 --> 01:29:18,515
Oh, John, my darling...

1167
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,269
You don't know what love is.

1168
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:27,725
You have no idea what it means
to love someone so much

1169
01:29:27,859 --> 01:29:30,561
that you will do anything for them.

1170
01:29:34,401 --> 01:29:37,067
Even inject them with poison

1171
01:29:37,192 --> 01:29:40,724
when they were too feeble
to do it for themselves.

1172
01:29:46,401 --> 01:29:49,684
I don't believe that you could've
ever loved me like that.

1173
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:00,185
Oh, John, let her go.

1174
01:30:02,986 --> 01:30:08,567
Let her go, off into the sunset
to inject another family with her poison!

1175
01:30:08,694 --> 01:30:10,685
Mother...
Off you go!

1176
01:30:10,819 --> 01:30:13,189
Before your past
catches up with you... again!

1177
01:30:13,319 --> 01:30:15,026
Mother!

1178
01:30:17,570 --> 01:30:19,893
Oh, you evil...

1179
01:30:20,028 --> 01:30:22,185
Mother! Shut up!

1180
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:27,934
They are predicting warmer weather,
Madam.

1181
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:31,187
Yes, Furber, I believe they are.
Thank you.

1182
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:37,861
Very generous.

1183
01:30:39,154 --> 01:30:42,401
There's something special in there
for Jackson. Make sure he gets it.

1184
01:30:42,529 --> 01:30:45,444
Of course.
Where will Madam be staying?

1185
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:47,945
Who knows?

1186
01:30:48,696 --> 01:30:50,237
Good luck.

1187
01:30:51,488 --> 01:30:53,230
And you, Furber.

1188
01:30:54,197 --> 01:30:56,768
Would you forward the painting please,
Furber?

1189
01:30:56,905 --> 01:30:59,192
To where, sir?

1190
01:31:05,572 --> 01:31:08,524
I shall enjoy passing on
the good news, sir.

1191
01:31:12,531 --> 01:31:18,315
Well, my dear, when the going
gets tough, the tough get going.

1192
01:31:18,448 --> 01:31:22,691
# I've got something to tell you
Really?

1193
01:31:23,740 --> 01:31:26,821
# I got something to say
I'm all ears.

1194
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:31,736
# I'm going to put
these wheels in motion

1195
01:31:31,866 --> 01:31:35,480
# And let nothing stand in my way...

1196
01:31:37,157 --> 01:31:41,566
# Darling,
I'll climb any mountain

1197
01:31:41,699 --> 01:31:45,528
# Darling, I'll do anything

1198
01:31:45,658 --> 01:31:48,360
# When the going gets tough

1199
01:31:50,492 --> 01:31:53,276
# The tough get going

1200
01:31:54,825 --> 01:31:57,859
# When the going gets rough

1201
01:31:59,617 --> 01:32:02,153
# The tough get rough

1202
01:32:04,284 --> 01:32:07,531
# Gonna get myself across the river

1203
01:32:08,493 --> 01:32:12,356
# That's the price that I'm willing to pay

1204
01:32:12,493 --> 01:32:17,197
# I'm gonna make you stand and deliver

1205
01:32:17,326 --> 01:32:21,735
# And give me love
in that old-fashioned way

1206
01:32:21,868 --> 01:32:26,988
# Oh, darling,
I'll climb any mountain

1207
01:32:27,119 --> 01:32:30,899
# Darling, I'll do anything

1208
01:32:31,035 --> 01:32:33,738
# Cos when the going gets tough

1209
01:32:35,827 --> 01:32:38,577
# The tough get going

1210
01:32:39,911 --> 01:32:43,111
# When the going gets rough

1211
01:32:44,911 --> 01:32:47,400
# The tough get rough...

1212
01:33:10,704 --> 01:33:15,611
