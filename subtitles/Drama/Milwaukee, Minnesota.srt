1
00:00:14,938 --> 00:00:16,963
Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.

2
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:19,499
Good evening.

3
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:22,904
Feels good tonight.

4
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:35,411
Jacks, go and get ready.
Your dad's coming.

5
00:00:35,488 --> 00:00:40,117
I fell into a burnin'
ring of fire

6
00:00:40,191 --> 00:00:42,159
Went down, down, down

7
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:44,319
And the flames went higher

8
00:00:44,396 --> 00:00:47,125
And it burns, burns, burns

9
00:00:47,197 --> 00:00:48,686
The ring of fire

10
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:50,392
Why do I have to go
with my father?

11
00:00:50,466 --> 00:00:53,628
Because Sam came first...

12
00:00:53,702 --> 00:00:55,260
you came second...

13
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,639
so...
I might as well keep the first.

14
00:01:03,944 --> 00:01:05,138
Bound

15
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:06,270
All right, ready?

16
00:01:06,346 --> 00:01:09,110
One, two, three.

17
00:01:09,182 --> 00:01:10,239
Paper beats rock.

18
00:01:10,315 --> 00:01:12,943
I fell into a ring of fire

19
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:17,954
I fell into
a burnin' ring of fire

20
00:01:18,022 --> 00:01:19,114
Went down, down, down

21
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,317
One, two, three.

22
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:22,653
Scissors beats paper.

23
00:01:22,726 --> 00:01:24,626
And it burns, burns, burns

24
00:01:24,694 --> 00:01:27,162
The ring of fire

25
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,197
The ring of fire

26
00:01:32,068 --> 00:01:35,002
The Memphis Horns
and the Tennessee 3.

27
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:46,542
The taste

28
00:01:46,612 --> 00:01:48,603
Of love is sweet

29
00:01:48,681 --> 00:01:50,648
I don't want to go
with my father.

30
00:01:50,715 --> 00:01:52,012
Get out.

31
00:01:52,084 --> 00:01:54,052
When hearts like ours meet

32
00:01:57,121 --> 00:01:58,988
I fell for you like a child

33
00:01:59,023 --> 00:02:02,617
All right, again.
One, two... Yes!

34
00:02:02,692 --> 00:02:04,387
Rock beats scissors.

35
00:02:04,461 --> 00:02:07,054
But the fire went wild

36
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:10,030
I fell into a burnin'
ring of fire

37
00:02:10,098 --> 00:02:11,292
Chicken.

38
00:02:11,365 --> 00:02:13,162
Went down, down, down

39
00:02:13,234 --> 00:02:15,225
And the flames went higher

40
00:02:15,302 --> 00:02:17,600
And it burns, burns, burns

41
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,638
The ring of fire

42
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,565
The ring of fire

43
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:25,576
And it burns, burns, burns

44
00:02:25,644 --> 00:02:27,942
The ring of fire

45
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,105
The ring of fire

46
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,079
Got you! You're dead!

47
00:02:38,589 --> 00:02:39,680
I'll show you whether I'm dead.

48
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:42,413
I fell into a burnin'
ring of fire

49
00:02:42,492 --> 00:02:43,617
Went down, down, down

50
00:02:43,692 --> 00:02:45,057
Get off of me!

51
00:02:45,127 --> 00:02:46,594
And the flames went higher

52
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:48,651
And it burns, burns, burns

53
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,923
The ring of fire

54
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:51,396
Aw, shit!

55
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,194
The ring of fire

56
00:02:54,267 --> 00:02:57,100
And it burns, burns, burns

57
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,434
The ring of fire

58
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:01,029
The ring of fire

59
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,477
See you.

60
00:03:27,127 --> 00:03:28,219
Come on!

61
00:03:36,003 --> 00:03:37,094
Fuck you, Red!

62
00:03:39,205 --> 00:03:41,434
Fuck you, too, baby!

63
00:04:01,657 --> 00:04:05,456
World's going to think your head
blowing apart is a backfire.

64
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:07,993
Don't miss.

65
00:04:08,061 --> 00:04:11,827
Forget about it, Red.
I'm not marrying him.

66
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:13,228
That's the deal you made.

67
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:15,494
Fuck the deal.

68
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,091
Fuck you!

69
00:04:23,575 --> 00:04:26,441
I would hit you in the face,
but it's your wedding day.

70
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,001
You get the fuck up...

71
00:04:29,078 --> 00:04:31,103
before you ruin
that nice dress even more.

72
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,442
Think you can make
a fool out of me...

73
00:04:32,515 --> 00:04:34,414
steal from me
and just walk away?

74
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:37,474
You lucky you got
a nice piece of ass.

75
00:04:37,552 --> 00:04:39,985
Otherwise...

76
00:04:40,054 --> 00:04:42,488
I don't even want
to think about it.

77
00:04:42,556 --> 00:04:44,148
You going to marry
that little fucker Sam...

78
00:04:44,225 --> 00:04:47,057
and you going
to cook and clean...

79
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,389
and you going to suck his cock
every once in a while.

80
00:04:49,461 --> 00:04:50,553
Do you want to know why?

81
00:04:53,565 --> 00:04:56,898
'Cause that's the worst thing
I can think to do to you.

82
00:05:00,104 --> 00:05:02,970
Now fix yourself up pretty
because people are waiting.

83
00:05:06,609 --> 00:05:08,167
You want to fight me?

84
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:09,472
Go fuck...

85
00:05:21,088 --> 00:05:22,578
I changed my mind.
Bill...

86
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,221
Stay right here.
Be right back.

87
00:05:36,401 --> 00:05:38,334
Yo, Red. Red, how you doing?

88
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:39,902
Yeah, what?

89
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:43,335
Shake hands.
Go get a job, man.

90
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:44,498
Got one?

91
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:47,268
Come on.

92
00:05:47,342 --> 00:05:49,275
That was good. I like that.

93
00:05:49,343 --> 00:05:51,574
- Hey, guys.
- Hi, Ruby.

94
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,941
My favorite cop.

95
00:05:54,014 --> 00:05:55,949
Yeah, what?

96
00:05:56,016 --> 00:05:58,644
I took care of that
little problem for you.

97
00:05:58,818 --> 00:06:00,251
You might want to go away
for a couple of days...

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,150
go fishing or something.

99
00:06:02,221 --> 00:06:03,347
All right.

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,494
- How'd we do this week?
- Good, boss.

101
00:06:13,897 --> 00:06:16,558
I don't know. It looks like
it could've been better.

102
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:20,102
Good... Business is good.

103
00:06:31,312 --> 00:06:33,006
Every day is payday.

104
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,950
That's a nice tux, Sam.

105
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:45,511
What's this?

106
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:49,851
The American dream, huh?

107
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:51,985
Yeah. Why not?

108
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:54,121
Hey, why not?

109
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:06,564
Get going, buddy.

110
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:07,900
Well...

111
00:07:09,376 --> 00:07:10,433
There she is...

112
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,445
Your Christmas bonus...
a few months early.

113
00:07:13,512 --> 00:07:17,039
You're a beautiful girl,
Freddie.

114
00:07:18,384 --> 00:07:22,251
I feel bad the way you turned up
in this bad crowd situation.

115
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,946
It's a shame.

116
00:07:25,255 --> 00:07:28,018
If ever you want a way out,
just...

117
00:07:29,559 --> 00:07:30,992
give me a call.

118
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,891
You know? Maybe I can help.

119
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:37,225
Fuck you.

120
00:07:37,299 --> 00:07:39,994
God. She's beautiful.

121
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:44,037
She was beautiful yesterday.

122
00:07:45,905 --> 00:07:47,873
Yeah, but today, she's mine.

123
00:07:51,443 --> 00:07:54,411
What are you fucking looking at?

124
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,242
Let me ask you something, Lloyd.

125
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,976
Why are you
such a fucking wick, huh?

126
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:19,462
All passengers
should be on board.

127
00:08:51,192 --> 00:08:54,457
I wonder if your brother
is going to show up.

128
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,859
Jacks.

129
00:08:55,929 --> 00:08:58,295
Who invited him?

130
00:08:58,398 --> 00:08:59,763
I told him it wasn't right...

131
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,165
if he didn't come
to his brother's wedding.

132
00:09:02,234 --> 00:09:06,966
But, please, if he comes,
try and get along with him.

133
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:08,903
Sam, I'm talking to you.

134
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:10,964
What if she doesn't come, Mom?

135
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:12,803
Will you stop eating?

136
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,879
I didn't take your money.
I told you that!

137
00:09:17,948 --> 00:09:19,972
You embarrass me, little girl.

138
00:09:20,049 --> 00:09:22,279
Sir, sit down right here.

139
00:09:25,921 --> 00:09:28,048
Come on, Freddie,
make it easy on yourself.

140
00:09:31,892 --> 00:09:34,292
Come on, get in the spirit.

141
00:09:40,165 --> 00:09:42,190
Straighten up.

142
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,815
Hope you two kids
will be very happy.

143
00:10:37,179 --> 00:10:38,840
Dearly beloved...

144
00:10:38,914 --> 00:10:41,814
we are gathered here
in the sight of God...

145
00:10:41,883 --> 00:10:42,940
to witness and bless...

146
00:10:43,016 --> 00:10:44,075
Hi, Mom.

147
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:45,913
the joining together
of Sam and Freddie...

148
00:10:45,986 --> 00:10:47,886
Jacks, you came.

149
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,045
How nice.

150
00:10:51,657 --> 00:10:53,215
What's the story?

151
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:56,624
They make a nice couple,
don't they?

152
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,556
No, they don't.

153
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,394
Behave yourself, Jacks.

154
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:03,399
But that is the portion
in this life...

155
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,434
What did you get them?

156
00:11:05,502 --> 00:11:07,799
Whisper it to me.

157
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:09,201
When it is God's will...

158
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:11,136
Come on.

159
00:11:11,206 --> 00:11:14,300
Nothing, Mom.
I didn't get them nothing.

160
00:11:14,376 --> 00:11:17,402
Knowledge
and love of the Lord...

161
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:19,878
Therefore, marriage
is not to be entered into...

162
00:11:19,947 --> 00:11:22,540
unadvisedly or lightly.

163
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,413
You showed up empty-handed.

164
00:11:25,485 --> 00:11:27,418
And in accordance...

165
00:11:27,452 --> 00:11:30,149
What is the matter with you,
Jacks?

166
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,484
Into the holy union...

167
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:35,458
Sam and Freddie
now come to be joined.

168
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,361
Here we go. I love this.

169
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,901
When somebody loves you

170
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:49,870
It's no good
unless he loves you

171
00:11:51,072 --> 00:11:53,870
All the way

172
00:11:55,176 --> 00:11:57,144
Happy to be near you

173
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,179
When you need someone
to cheer you

174
00:12:01,348 --> 00:12:04,214
All the way

175
00:12:09,487 --> 00:12:10,748
Can I get a beer?

176
00:12:12,556 --> 00:12:15,081
I just want to get
the fuck out of here.

177
00:12:17,493 --> 00:12:18,552
Thanks.

178
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:24,391
Who are you?

179
00:12:24,466 --> 00:12:26,161
Jacks.

180
00:12:27,302 --> 00:12:28,496
Jack?

181
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:29,501
No, Jacks.

182
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:31,939
Jacks?

183
00:12:34,341 --> 00:12:36,832
- Jacks what?
- Clayton.

184
00:12:39,912 --> 00:12:41,209
You're not related to him,
are you?

185
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,544
Sam's my brother.

186
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:49,342
I don't know who's worse off,
you or me.

187
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:54,089
Me.

188
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:05,297
Are you shy?

189
00:13:08,302 --> 00:13:09,428
No.

190
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,198
He ain't heavy.

191
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:13,034
He's my shithead brother.

192
00:13:14,941 --> 00:13:17,101
You didn't have to get
all dressed up, you know?

193
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:23,307
What were you in for
this time, huh?

194
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:28,151
My brother likes to spend
his free time in prison...

195
00:13:28,218 --> 00:13:30,084
isn't that right, Jacks?

196
00:13:30,154 --> 00:13:31,552
Whenever I can get away.

197
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,323
This is my new wife Freddie.

198
00:13:45,365 --> 00:13:46,333
Come on.

199
00:13:50,537 --> 00:13:52,128
Chicken.

200
00:13:52,204 --> 00:13:53,432
Come on.

201
00:14:00,177 --> 00:14:02,874
Scissors beats paper.

202
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:03,913
Come on.

203
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:08,316
Paper beats rock.

204
00:14:08,384 --> 00:14:09,976
OK?

205
00:14:10,053 --> 00:14:11,020
Come on.

206
00:14:15,757 --> 00:14:16,746
Shit!

207
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:19,349
Rock beats scissors.

208
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,332
God!

209
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,994
Fuck!

210
00:14:37,241 --> 00:14:39,334
She's a knockout, isn't she?

211
00:14:40,577 --> 00:14:43,341
So you won the game,
I won the girl.

212
00:14:51,453 --> 00:14:53,182
I can't believe
you even showed up.

213
00:14:53,254 --> 00:14:55,221
Especially without a present.

214
00:15:02,096 --> 00:15:03,494
Nice tux, Sam.

215
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,474
I'm going to go pee.

216
00:15:22,945 --> 00:15:24,914
They

217
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,470
Asked me how I knew

218
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:32,282
My true love was true

219
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,830
A little to the left.

220
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,461
A little to the right.

221
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:54,465
Bull's-eye!

222
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:15,716
Did you come for me?

223
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:16,881
I don't even know you.

224
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:18,253
No! Did you come for me?

225
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:20,781
Did you?

226
00:17:02,726 --> 00:17:05,422
You got to shave, baby.
You're ruining my skin.

227
00:17:16,205 --> 00:17:17,399
Jesus.

228
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:20,035
I look like shit.

229
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:22,765
Don't I look like shit?

230
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:25,675
Yeah, I do.

231
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:27,940
I'm getting old.

232
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:31,449
You're not even, what,
twenty-five?

233
00:17:31,517 --> 00:17:33,780
I'm closer to thirty
than to twenty.

234
00:17:35,787 --> 00:17:38,756
I used to be seven years old.

235
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:42,791
I used to be unborn.

236
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,384
I used to be fourteen.

237
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:49,022
And tomorrow
I'll be forty or fifty.

238
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:53,097
So?

239
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:55,398
I'm dying.

240
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:58,404
I'm dying. You're dying.

241
00:17:58,505 --> 00:18:02,032
Right now, we're both dying.

242
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:03,905
Listen to the ticking.

243
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:08,344
It gets louder
with every second.

244
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:14,182
I don't want to die here.

245
00:18:14,252 --> 00:18:16,186
You should just split.

246
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:17,686
Really?

247
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:22,983
You think those guys are just
gonna let me walk away?

248
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,225
They haven't yet.

249
00:18:28,263 --> 00:18:31,721
See? They did this to me.

250
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,959
- Jesus.
- Yeah, Jesus.

251
00:18:37,938 --> 00:18:40,428
Red says that
I owe him ten grand.

252
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:42,770
He says that I stole it
from him.

253
00:18:42,842 --> 00:18:43,934
It's bullshit.

254
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:49,378
He found it on the books.
Your damn brother did.

255
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,004
So, there it is.

256
00:18:54,084 --> 00:18:55,449
I'm his reward.

257
00:18:56,854 --> 00:18:58,218
He's my punishment.

258
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,619
Fuck them anyways.

259
00:19:09,764 --> 00:19:11,197
Fuck them anyways.

260
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,045
See you out back?

261
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:46,059
You see a pair
of laughing eyes

262
00:19:46,126 --> 00:19:49,755
And suddenly
you're sighing sighs

263
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,456
You're thinking nothing's wrong

264
00:19:51,698 --> 00:19:54,360
You string along, boy, then snap

265
00:19:56,035 --> 00:19:58,401
Those eyes, those sighs

266
00:19:58,471 --> 00:20:01,666
They're part of the tender trap

267
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,970
It'll always turn to shit.

268
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:12,405
Not only don't you bring
a gift...

269
00:20:12,482 --> 00:20:14,847
you don't even say good-bye.

270
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:20,116
Those dreams that dream

271
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,986
They're part of the tender trap

272
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:27,125
Some starry night

273
00:20:27,194 --> 00:20:31,129
When her kisses make you tingle

274
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:34,131
She'll hold you tight

275
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,759
And you'll hate yourself
for bein'...

276
00:21:13,866 --> 00:21:16,197
Empty the cash.

277
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,791
Come on, come on!
Move it, move it, move it!

278
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:22,463
Jacks? Jacks, is that you?

279
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,070
Damn it.

280
00:21:24,173 --> 00:21:25,937
Just give me the money.

281
00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:27,976
You wouldn't shoot me,
would you?

282
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:31,111
I'm not gonna shoot you.

283
00:21:42,188 --> 00:21:44,247
Sorry, Bob.

284
00:22:02,671 --> 00:22:05,037
In my life

285
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:08,439
There's been heartache and pain

286
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:14,046
I don't know
if I can face it again

287
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,048
Can't stop now

288
00:22:16,117 --> 00:22:18,050
I've traveled so far

289
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:19,914
It's a candy dish.

290
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:22,077
Congratulations
on your marriage.

291
00:22:23,121 --> 00:22:24,089
Good-bye.

292
00:22:34,498 --> 00:22:36,089
Don't leave me.

293
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,707
I'm sorry.

294
00:22:49,243 --> 00:22:50,709
Mommy!

295
00:22:51,778 --> 00:22:54,008
- Oh, my God.
- Is she all right?

296
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:04,020
You...

297
00:23:04,088 --> 00:23:06,022
You killed her.

298
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,768
You show up to my wedding
after no one invites you.

299
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:33,641
Mom invited me.

300
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:35,044
Get her all upset...

301
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:37,638
so she faints and dies
just like that.

302
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:39,343
Maybe it was you who upset her.

303
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,647
Me? Not me.
I was her favorite!

304
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,086
She didn't send me off packing
when I was eight!

305
00:23:50,426 --> 00:23:51,687
Stupid.

306
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:56,655
Hey, Freddie.

307
00:23:57,765 --> 00:23:59,289
Sorry.

308
00:23:59,367 --> 00:24:01,994
So how is married life
treating you?

309
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,004
That good, huh?

310
00:24:08,807 --> 00:24:11,037
Hey, can I bum one of those?

311
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:15,738
Thanks.

312
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,409
Sorry about your mother, boys.

313
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:24,620
Mine died about six years ago.

314
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:27,053
Worst fuckin' day of my life.

315
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:30,023
I need a word with you, Jacks.

316
00:24:30,091 --> 00:24:32,025
Why? Huh?

317
00:24:32,093 --> 00:24:34,061
What did he do this time?

318
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:39,024
Christ!
What did you do that for?

319
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,157
Tell me about the gas station
you knocked off.

320
00:24:41,234 --> 00:24:44,203
I got a captain crawling
up my ass for an answer...

321
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,034
so I'm gonna take
a little refuge up yours.

322
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:49,130
Now that old guy, Bob...

323
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:52,904
he didn't see you,
but he heard you, right?

324
00:24:57,715 --> 00:24:59,978
It's always something
when you show up.

325
00:25:01,618 --> 00:25:03,949
It's not finished
between me and you, Jacks.

326
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:05,350
Just want you to know that.

327
00:25:20,366 --> 00:25:22,391
I can't sleep.

328
00:25:22,635 --> 00:25:24,864
It's cold in here.
Want another blanket?

329
00:25:32,076 --> 00:25:33,600
Did you stay for me?

330
00:25:35,078 --> 00:25:36,978
I stayed to bury my mother.

331
00:25:41,683 --> 00:25:42,877
Tomorrow?

332
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:44,417
I'm taking off.

333
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:55,676
I know you've been
thinking about me.

334
00:25:55,711 --> 00:25:58,226
'Cause I've been
thinking about you.

335
00:25:59,865 --> 00:26:02,233
And when I do...

336
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:04,065
I can feel you inside me.

337
00:26:07,205 --> 00:26:09,764
You want to be
inside me again, Jacks?

338
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,799
We shouldn't.

339
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,275
Again.

340
00:26:55,244 --> 00:26:57,872
I thought I told you to shave.

341
00:26:57,945 --> 00:26:59,071
Sorry.

342
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:14,952
Have you ever
been to Vegas, Jacks?

343
00:27:17,996 --> 00:27:19,657
It's the best.

344
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:22,722
I went there when I was little
with my mom.

345
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,966
We met Ann-Margret.

346
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:28,970
Man, she was the coolest.

347
00:27:29,038 --> 00:27:30,972
I mean, she was like...

348
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,735
Like a kitten with balls,
you know what I mean?

349
00:27:36,611 --> 00:27:38,009
She gave me this.

350
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,648
She signed her picture
and gave me this.

351
00:27:45,051 --> 00:27:47,019
It's supposed to bring me luck.

352
00:27:50,922 --> 00:27:52,287
Let's just go.

353
00:27:53,658 --> 00:27:57,025
Let's just start this thing up
and get out of here.

354
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,587
I can't.

355
00:28:01,665 --> 00:28:04,189
Why? Why can't you see?

356
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:06,291
Maybe all this shit happened
with me, with you...

357
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:07,801
with your mom dying...

358
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,803
Maybe it happened
so we'd end up together.

359
00:28:09,871 --> 00:28:11,600
I can't.

360
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:15,038
If you leave me here
with these bastards...

361
00:28:15,109 --> 00:28:17,771
I swear you're a bigger fucker
than they are.

362
00:28:17,845 --> 00:28:19,540
Don't you see?

363
00:28:19,613 --> 00:28:22,740
It feels too good.

364
00:28:22,815 --> 00:28:25,806
It's gonna turn to shit!
I just can't!

365
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,824
Come on. I can make you happy.

366
00:28:43,899 --> 00:28:46,867
- Don't touch me.
- I can't sleep.

367
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:48,299
I'm not in the mood.
Get off of me.

368
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,961
For Christ sakes, Freddie.
You're my wife.

369
00:28:50,037 --> 00:28:52,767
- I want to make love.
- I don't want it!

370
00:28:54,307 --> 00:28:56,969
- Let me...
- No, it hurts.

371
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:58,945
Don't push me away. Please.

372
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:00,639
Sam, stop.

373
00:29:00,713 --> 00:29:02,873
It hurts like that.
Come on. Get off me!

374
00:29:02,947 --> 00:29:04,847
But it feels good like that.

375
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,325
It's great out here.

376
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:20,961
Wait for me. Come on.

377
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,089
Right over there.

378
00:29:56,025 --> 00:29:57,651
What are you doing back here?

379
00:29:57,725 --> 00:30:00,216
I got a car waiting outside.

380
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,858
For me?

381
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,129
You came back for me?

382
00:30:10,937 --> 00:30:12,995
Where are we going?

383
00:30:17,776 --> 00:30:19,141
What are you doing?

384
00:30:20,778 --> 00:30:22,609
I'll be back in a minute.

385
00:31:02,212 --> 00:31:05,648
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

386
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:11,542
Me neither.

387
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:15,790
It came with the car.

388
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,608
They're gonna be looking for me,
you know.

389
00:31:40,076 --> 00:31:41,599
I know.

390
00:31:56,423 --> 00:31:59,118
How young are you?

391
00:31:59,191 --> 00:32:01,523
How old am I?

392
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:04,926
Let's count the rings

393
00:32:04,996 --> 00:32:07,328
Around my eyes

394
00:32:13,304 --> 00:32:16,204
How smart are you?

395
00:32:16,272 --> 00:32:19,241
How dumb am I?

396
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:22,004
Don't count any

397
00:32:22,077 --> 00:32:24,943
Of my advice

398
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,240
Meet me

399
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:27,804
- Anyplace
- Anywhere

400
00:32:27,882 --> 00:32:30,043
Or anytime

401
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:31,675
Now, I don't care

402
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:33,275
Meet me tonight

403
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:47,162
Let me speak to Red orJoseph.

404
00:32:48,198 --> 00:32:50,632
Look, I don't care
what time it is.

405
00:32:51,935 --> 00:32:53,301
OK, I'm sorry.

406
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,031
Just give me the...

407
00:32:59,975 --> 00:33:01,943
I gotta turn my life around.

408
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:04,307
I gotta do things different.

409
00:33:04,545 --> 00:33:06,877
So is this doing things
differently...

410
00:33:06,946 --> 00:33:08,938
running off
with someone else's wife?

411
00:33:10,116 --> 00:33:11,947
You can't look at it like that.

412
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,912
I mean,
look at it like this...

413
00:33:15,988 --> 00:33:18,513
Time is like...

414
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:21,324
an orange.

415
00:33:23,995 --> 00:33:24,926
It's round.

416
00:33:24,995 --> 00:33:27,520
It means that everything
repeats itself.

417
00:33:27,597 --> 00:33:31,862
And everything that happens
happens for a reason.

418
00:33:33,102 --> 00:33:37,006
Lieutenant Ben Something.

419
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,973
Some...

420
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,974
Costikyan! Yes!

421
00:33:42,043 --> 00:33:43,532
Yes, just leave a message.

422
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,544
No, I don't need
to speak to anybody!

423
00:33:45,612 --> 00:33:47,443
Just leave a message, OK?
Thanks.

424
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:52,249
The big promise I made myself...

425
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:55,218
was that I'd never spend
another day in prison.

426
00:33:55,286 --> 00:33:57,276
Not one.

427
00:33:57,355 --> 00:33:59,186
You want to know the truth?

428
00:33:59,256 --> 00:34:01,087
You want to avoid prison?

429
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:02,988
Quit sticking up gas stations.

430
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:06,290
What I'm talking about
is different.

431
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:10,555
I'm just saying go home
one last time and get the money.

432
00:34:10,632 --> 00:34:11,792
We have a little cash.

433
00:34:11,867 --> 00:34:14,130
I got fifty bucks
stuffed in my underwear...

434
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:17,659
and you've got enough
to spring for this swell place?

435
00:34:17,738 --> 00:34:21,105
We left in a hurry, Jacks.
We forgot.

436
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:23,108
- I know, but...
- Come on.

437
00:34:23,175 --> 00:34:25,770
We're almost there.

438
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,778
Almost.

439
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:31,838
It's like, if I close my eyes...

440
00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:35,077
I can see us in Vegas...

441
00:34:35,153 --> 00:34:37,586
lying by a pool...

442
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:40,145
with water in it.

443
00:34:41,825 --> 00:34:44,258
It's always sunny and warm.

444
00:34:45,928 --> 00:34:49,260
And guys in white jackets
bring us daiquiris...

445
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,890
and all the food we can eat
for four bucks.

446
00:34:53,167 --> 00:34:58,331
And all the towels smell
like Downy fabric softener.

447
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:01,496
There's no clocks, no bedtime...

448
00:35:01,574 --> 00:35:03,803
and when I get going there...

449
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:05,775
you can come see me
perform at night.

450
00:35:05,844 --> 00:35:08,539
I'd be wearing
big red feathers...

451
00:35:08,612 --> 00:35:10,204
one of those things
on my head...

452
00:35:10,282 --> 00:35:13,148
like crown things,
with diamonds in it.

453
00:35:14,318 --> 00:35:18,515
When I come offstage
I'd be too wired to sleep...

454
00:35:18,588 --> 00:35:21,283
so we'll make love
until morning...

455
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:23,650
sleep until 2:00.

456
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:45,042
It's half my money, Jacks,
right?

457
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,043
I'm his wife, right?

458
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,874
It's the law.

459
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,310
He kept saying that he
was gonna make me happy...

460
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,814
that he had all this
money stashed away.

461
00:35:56,886 --> 00:35:59,718
So after everything...

462
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:01,517
let him make me happy,
Jacks.

463
00:36:02,891 --> 00:36:06,189
I just don't know
where he hides it.

464
00:36:07,494 --> 00:36:08,462
What?

465
00:36:22,707 --> 00:36:24,971
You know where, don't you?

466
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:27,236
Do you?

467
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,005
Look at me.

468
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:36,262
You told me to call, Ben.

469
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:38,831
Nothing.

470
00:37:38,902 --> 00:37:41,132
He's back.

471
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:42,638
Alone.

472
00:38:00,254 --> 00:38:02,881
I spend my whole life trying
not to come back here.

473
00:38:02,955 --> 00:38:05,947
I always end up
coming back here.

474
00:38:06,024 --> 00:38:07,924
Where's Freddie?

475
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:10,483
Why don't I just
put the money back...

476
00:38:10,562 --> 00:38:13,530
and really never come back?

477
00:38:13,598 --> 00:38:16,657
So you and my wife
can live happily ever after?

478
00:38:16,733 --> 00:38:18,928
That sounds like
a really good deal for me.

479
00:38:19,002 --> 00:38:21,595
We're gonna go at it,
aren't we, Sam?

480
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:23,638
Big time.

481
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:33,805
Shit!

482
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:57,163
Bastard.

483
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:12,535
Shit.

484
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,642
You bastard! You piece of shit!

485
00:39:58,082 --> 00:39:59,743
Take a little refuge up yours.

486
00:40:47,056 --> 00:40:48,750
Jeez. You need a doctor?

487
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:51,725
I need a tank of gas.

488
00:40:51,793 --> 00:40:54,727
Just fill it up.
Where's your can?

489
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,627
Hello.
I just saw a cop get beat up.

490
00:41:43,703 --> 00:41:47,899
Ben... Ben Costi-hoo!
Costikyan.

491
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,133
Yes, I did. Jacks Clayton.

492
00:41:50,207 --> 00:41:53,267
I don't know. He just
beat the hell out of him.

493
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,501
He might be dead. Yes.

494
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,069
One-eighty-two Goodrich.

495
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,445
That's right. I don't...

496
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:37,535
Stop! That's my horse!

497
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,239
Clementine!

498
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,688
Hi, honey. I'm home.

499
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:29,086
What happened?

500
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:31,919
- I got him good.
- You need a doctor.

501
00:43:31,991 --> 00:43:33,480
No. I hate doctors.

502
00:43:33,558 --> 00:43:36,026
I always throw up
around doctors.

503
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:40,990
Shit. I can't believe this.

504
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:43,897
Look. This is what he did.

505
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,491
Christ.

506
00:43:45,568 --> 00:43:47,762
I hung on to the sucker, though.

507
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:49,600
My God, that is disgusting.

508
00:43:49,672 --> 00:43:51,536
I don’t feel good.

509
00:43:51,607 --> 00:43:53,471
Let me help you, OK?

510
00:43:53,542 --> 00:43:54,872
I need to lie down.

511
00:43:54,942 --> 00:43:57,103
Yeah, you should lie down.

512
00:43:57,178 --> 00:43:59,168
You sure you know
what you're doing?

513
00:43:59,412 --> 00:44:01,380
Be quiet.

514
00:44:01,481 --> 00:44:02,743
You know how to operate this?

515
00:44:02,816 --> 00:44:03,907
Look at that.

516
00:44:16,226 --> 00:44:18,057
Isn't that your horse?

517
00:44:20,197 --> 00:44:23,188
I didn't mean for this
to happen, Jacks.

518
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:24,490
I'm so sorry.

519
00:44:34,708 --> 00:44:36,698
I'm afraid to ask.

520
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:39,773
What?

521
00:44:42,481 --> 00:44:43,846
Did you get the money?

522
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:47,784
You think this is the best time
to discuss finances?

523
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,946
It's my last chance, Jacks.

524
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:52,781
Yeah.

525
00:44:57,627 --> 00:44:58,753
I got it.

526
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:18,436
That's what I found.

527
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:21,671
He's got more than this.
He said so.

528
00:45:21,746 --> 00:45:25,161
- I don't understand.
- It's enough.

529
00:45:25,195 --> 00:45:28,576
We can check out of here
and go...

530
00:45:28,652 --> 00:45:30,176
in the morning.

531
00:45:32,122 --> 00:45:35,454
What are we gonna do?
This was our last chance!

532
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:37,789
They're gonna find us
and fucking kill us!

533
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,019
How could you
let him get to you?

534
00:45:39,094 --> 00:45:41,926
I didn't let him get to me.

535
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:43,430
Let go of me!

536
00:45:43,497 --> 00:45:44,589
I counted on you, Jacks!

537
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:47,031
- Hey, shut up in there!
- You shut up!

538
00:45:47,101 --> 00:45:49,898
You shut the fuck up!

539
00:45:55,507 --> 00:45:57,201
Is everything
all right in there?

540
00:45:57,443 --> 00:45:59,138
What's going on?

541
00:45:59,377 --> 00:46:00,810
Where are the car keys?

542
00:46:00,878 --> 00:46:03,005
I'm gonna call the cops!

543
00:46:03,081 --> 00:46:05,844
I'll get you some help.

544
00:46:05,916 --> 00:46:09,851
Show's over, so crawl
back into your fucking hole.

545
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,214
All right.

546
00:46:20,161 --> 00:46:21,423
Hi, Freddie.

547
00:46:21,496 --> 00:46:24,464
- Where's Red and Joseph?
- It's just me.

548
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,965
Let's go for a drive.

549
00:46:27,033 --> 00:46:28,591
Come on.

550
00:46:28,668 --> 00:46:30,693
Come on, I want to talk.

551
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,135
Come on, drive.

552
00:46:42,612 --> 00:46:44,604
You don't need that gun.

553
00:46:44,681 --> 00:46:47,377
You gotta be reasonable
about this.

554
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:49,818
This wasn't meant to be.

555
00:46:49,853 --> 00:46:51,012
You know?

556
00:46:54,222 --> 00:46:58,682
I'm sure
there's lots of girls...

557
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,819
I guess, who...

558
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:04,693
would be just right for you.

559
00:47:11,970 --> 00:47:14,495
Let's talk about it.

560
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:17,131
It was supposed
to be a surprise...

561
00:47:17,374 --> 00:47:18,864
but I can tell you now.

562
00:47:18,942 --> 00:47:21,740
I sent half the money already.

563
00:47:21,812 --> 00:47:23,745
Not a down payment,
but half of it.

564
00:47:23,813 --> 00:47:25,371
You would...

565
00:47:27,149 --> 00:47:31,085
You'd laugh if you knew how hard
it was to get this money.

566
00:47:31,153 --> 00:47:33,677
Red’s shit his pants.

567
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:36,353
Look.

568
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:42,521
This is the model right here.
It's nice.

569
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:45,654
It's 2,700 square feet.

570
00:47:45,731 --> 00:47:47,994
Central air and heat.

571
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:51,661
It's got cable
with fifty-seven channels...

572
00:47:52,804 --> 00:47:54,169
a two-car garage...

573
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:57,737
and look, a swimming pool
with tennis courts...

574
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,866
and a park, you know,
that they're building.

575
00:47:59,942 --> 00:48:02,775
I can't breathe.

576
00:48:02,845 --> 00:48:05,074
Don't open the fucking door!

577
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:14,718
Look, I know that your dream
is to live in Vegas...

578
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:17,052
but this is close to Vegas,
but better.

579
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:21,024
It's like a real neighborhood.

580
00:48:22,627 --> 00:48:24,026
We have a choice.

581
00:48:24,096 --> 00:48:25,757
Look what it says here.

582
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:32,098
"Eggplant or ecru"
for the carpeting.

583
00:48:34,105 --> 00:48:35,401
Is that a color?

584
00:48:35,471 --> 00:48:38,804
I don't know. I guess.

585
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:43,439
Eggplant.

586
00:48:54,654 --> 00:48:57,645
And how many children
should we have?

587
00:49:01,059 --> 00:49:02,526
Two.

588
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,562
You're a liar.

589
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,891
Can I get a Coke...

590
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,930
and a Hostess cupcake?

591
00:51:49,998 --> 00:51:51,123
Sure.

592
00:51:53,165 --> 00:51:56,066
One of those sweatshirts, too.

593
00:51:57,569 --> 00:51:58,934
Here.

594
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:30,087
What are you famous for?

595
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:34,892
I don't know.

596
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:37,697
That was a nice horse you had.

597
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:38,827
What?

598
00:52:38,903 --> 00:52:40,837
You know.

599
00:52:42,674 --> 00:52:44,004
Yeah, thanks.

600
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:46,907
So, did you call the cops?

601
00:52:46,977 --> 00:52:49,069
No. Why? Did you?

602
00:52:49,146 --> 00:52:51,807
No. It wasn't my horse.

603
00:53:22,673 --> 00:53:24,697
Shoot.

604
00:53:31,413 --> 00:53:32,436
Could I use your phone?

605
00:53:32,514 --> 00:53:35,505
I'm sorry. We can't tie it up.

606
00:53:35,583 --> 00:53:38,483
Tie it up?

607
00:53:40,787 --> 00:53:43,415
- Who's gonna call?
- Sorry.

608
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,016
There's trouble in there.
A murder!

609
00:54:24,089 --> 00:54:25,681
I saw the guy.

610
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:29,924
My name?

611
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:37,498
Shit.

612
00:54:52,846 --> 00:54:54,541
Jesus.

613
00:55:02,387 --> 00:55:03,513
Oh, shit.

614
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:48,880
This is
the manager of the motel.

615
00:55:48,958 --> 00:55:50,483
The police are here.

616
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,720
They want to have a look
around your room.

617
00:55:52,794 --> 00:55:56,059
Whatever you got going in there,
get rid of it.

618
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:57,257
I ain't in the mood
to have the place busted.

619
00:56:04,972 --> 00:56:07,371
So, what's going on?

620
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,839
Well, let's find out.

621
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:17,481
I just spoke to him.

622
00:56:20,717 --> 00:56:22,981
I'm sorry.
I was in the bathroom...

623
00:56:23,053 --> 00:56:25,283
and my wife is sleeping.

624
00:56:25,355 --> 00:56:26,722
Please, let's whisper.

625
00:56:26,756 --> 00:56:28,917
She's come down
with some sort of flu.

626
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:42,501
Poor thing was throwing up
all night.

627
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:47,335
She just fell asleep
maybe ten minutes ago.

628
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:49,874
What happened to you?

629
00:56:49,941 --> 00:56:55,071
My stupid brother and me.
We got drunk.

630
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:56,541
It was stupid.

631
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,686
- What's this?
- What?

632
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,723
There's blood here on the sink.

633
00:57:10,692 --> 00:57:13,216
From my head.
He got me pretty good.

634
00:57:13,294 --> 00:57:14,556
But I got him better.

635
00:57:14,629 --> 00:57:15,994
Where is your brother?

636
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:17,791
Kicked his ass back home.

637
00:57:17,864 --> 00:57:19,797
I came to visit, right?

638
00:57:19,866 --> 00:57:21,857
He gets drunk
and all bent out of shape.

639
00:57:21,935 --> 00:57:23,595
Who needs that, right?

640
00:57:23,669 --> 00:57:25,000
Where is home?

641
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:30,405
About half an hour
outside of St. Paul.

642
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:31,942
Let's go.

643
00:57:34,711 --> 00:57:36,678
Why don't you come on outside?

644
00:57:41,784 --> 00:57:43,945
Come on out here for a second.

645
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,044
Just need to talk to you.

646
00:57:47,322 --> 00:57:49,255
You ever been in any trouble?

647
00:57:49,324 --> 00:57:50,654
Not really.

648
00:57:50,724 --> 00:57:51,986
Maybe a little.

649
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:55,027
You got a record?
Figured as much.

650
00:57:55,094 --> 00:57:56,925
You staying out of trouble?

651
00:57:56,996 --> 00:58:00,226
Yes, sir.
I've got my life and my wife.

652
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:02,733
That's all a man needs
to turn things around.

653
00:58:04,736 --> 00:58:06,600
Yeah, well...

654
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,595
I'm sorry, Freddie.

655
01:01:14,624 --> 01:01:15,750
And?

656
01:01:15,825 --> 01:01:17,794
What...

657
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:20,829
I got an emergency call,
come on!

658
01:01:20,896 --> 01:01:25,764
Life is one big emergency,
man, so fuck off.

659
01:01:27,569 --> 01:01:29,593
Some asshole. I don't know.

660
01:01:45,416 --> 01:01:48,317
Am I given to understand
you killed Freddie Clayton?

661
01:01:48,386 --> 01:01:49,716
Is that true?

662
01:01:53,355 --> 01:01:54,983
Is that a yes or a no?

663
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:57,821
It doesn't matter because
your brother here...

664
01:01:57,893 --> 01:01:59,724
says he knows where
you stashed the body.

665
01:01:59,795 --> 01:02:02,285
And if that's true,
that's a very sad thing...

666
01:02:02,363 --> 01:02:04,297
because that was
a beautiful girl...

667
01:02:04,365 --> 01:02:06,799
with her whole life
ahead of her!

668
01:02:08,969 --> 01:02:10,993
Son of a bitch.

669
01:02:13,706 --> 01:02:15,901
I liked that girl.

670
01:02:20,712 --> 01:02:23,737
Kind of a stupid fucking name
is that, anyway?

671
01:02:28,317 --> 01:02:29,250
What?

672
01:02:29,353 --> 01:02:30,651
It was supposed to be Jack...

673
01:02:30,686 --> 01:02:33,917
but they fucked up
his birth certificate.

674
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:35,522
No, yeah!

675
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:38,650
A stupid fucking typo.

676
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,660
That's all your life
amounts to, huh?

677
01:02:52,338 --> 01:02:53,634
It's here somewhere.

678
01:02:53,705 --> 01:02:55,229
Where?

679
01:02:57,708 --> 01:02:59,505
He must've did something
with it.

680
01:02:59,577 --> 01:03:01,976
Sure you got the right spot?

681
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,440
Well, there's nothing here.

682
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:05,981
Don't point out the obvious.
It's fucking annoying.

683
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:07,978
No, he moved her.
You did something.

684
01:03:08,218 --> 01:03:10,685
Where is she?

685
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:12,550
Come on!

686
01:03:12,621 --> 01:03:14,588
Hey, hey! Jesus!

687
01:03:14,656 --> 01:03:18,352
You think I've got the time
to fool around?

688
01:03:18,425 --> 01:03:20,825
You remember I'm a cop!

689
01:03:20,893 --> 01:03:22,828
People depend on me.

690
01:03:22,895 --> 01:03:24,863
I'm here to serve and protect.

691
01:03:24,931 --> 01:03:27,263
I don't have the time
to fuck around...

692
01:03:27,333 --> 01:03:28,993
with a couple of fucking losers
like you!

693
01:03:29,235 --> 01:03:30,600
But I saw it!

694
01:03:30,635 --> 01:03:32,296
How do you know she's here?

695
01:03:32,370 --> 01:03:34,200
Maybe it's up the road
or something.

696
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:37,297
This is it. This is the spot.

697
01:03:37,374 --> 01:03:40,206
I'm telling you what I saw!

698
01:03:42,378 --> 01:03:44,608
I don't think so.
You find your own way back.

699
01:03:44,681 --> 01:03:46,308
You can't just leave me
out here.

700
01:03:46,415 --> 01:03:48,007
I can't, huh?

701
01:04:20,743 --> 01:04:22,540
Gimme a light, asshole.

702
01:04:36,489 --> 01:04:37,979
So what went wrong?

703
01:04:39,558 --> 01:04:41,788
She make you mad?

704
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:43,520
Come on, you can tell me.

705
01:04:43,594 --> 01:04:46,927
What did you do with her body?
You know I know.

706
01:04:47,031 --> 01:04:50,228
People know she didn't
want to be with you.

707
01:04:50,301 --> 01:04:52,734
And people know
you let those motherfuckers...

708
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:54,963
write that on her arm,
you bastard!

709
01:04:55,038 --> 01:04:57,471
- I didn't tell 'em to do it!
- Who did?

710
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,972
She was my wife!

711
01:05:00,007 --> 01:05:02,404
For four fucking days!

712
01:05:02,477 --> 01:05:04,445
So?

713
01:05:04,512 --> 01:05:06,240
Wasn't conventional.

714
01:05:06,313 --> 01:05:08,304
We didn't meet at the prom.
So what?

715
01:05:08,382 --> 01:05:10,782
So why couldn't
she love me anyway?

716
01:05:15,388 --> 01:05:18,152
You know I didn't have
any reason to kill her...

717
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:19,589
but you did!

718
01:05:19,659 --> 01:05:23,185
I can't remember anything,
but you were there, right?

719
01:05:23,261 --> 01:05:24,659
Maybe.

720
01:05:42,944 --> 01:05:44,779
Where's the body?

721
01:05:44,813 --> 01:05:47,246
Kiss my ass.

722
01:05:47,314 --> 01:05:50,578
Hey, you set me up.

723
01:05:53,419 --> 01:05:54,885
Only if you're setting me up.

724
01:06:07,396 --> 01:06:11,367
So, was it love or just...
with Freddie?

725
01:06:11,401 --> 01:06:12,459
Fuck off.

726
01:06:15,237 --> 01:06:18,501
A good blow job feels like love
every time, right?

727
01:06:29,782 --> 01:06:30,713
Shit!

728
01:06:40,523 --> 01:06:41,148
I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

729
01:06:41,825 --> 01:06:43,315
Not for a minute.

730
01:06:43,393 --> 01:06:45,326
That's fine with me.

731
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:51,932
Where you going?

732
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:58,835
Don't answer it.

733
01:07:04,644 --> 01:07:06,134
Who is it?

734
01:07:11,349 --> 01:07:12,907
Tell my brother
what you just told me.

735
01:07:13,151 --> 01:07:14,117
Who is it?

736
01:07:14,184 --> 01:07:16,413
Just take the phone.

737
01:07:20,189 --> 01:07:21,815
That's right, Mr. Clayton.

738
01:07:21,891 --> 01:07:26,189
What my wife saw the other night
made me sick.

739
01:07:26,261 --> 01:07:29,662
One of you carrying
that woman...

740
01:07:29,730 --> 01:07:32,358
her body... into the room...

741
01:07:32,433 --> 01:07:34,366
and then the other one
carrying her out.

742
01:07:34,434 --> 01:07:35,868
I think you know what I mean.

743
01:07:35,935 --> 01:07:38,904
Fifty thousand dollars
ought to do it.

744
01:07:41,241 --> 01:07:44,265
I don't want to be hard,
'cause you got problems...

745
01:07:44,343 --> 01:07:46,367
but I'd really like
the money by morning...

746
01:07:46,445 --> 01:07:48,809
or I'll have to go
to the police.

747
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:50,813
Sorry for the inconvenience.

748
01:07:54,618 --> 01:07:56,415
Did you hear what he said?

749
01:07:58,788 --> 01:08:01,654
He said...

750
01:08:01,724 --> 01:08:05,318
one of us carried her body
into the room...

751
01:08:05,393 --> 01:08:07,883
and one of us carried her out.

752
01:08:12,666 --> 01:08:14,566
I only carried her out.

753
01:08:16,803 --> 01:08:19,896
I mean, I couldn't remember.

754
01:08:22,774 --> 01:08:24,331
You bastard!

755
01:08:24,408 --> 01:08:26,273
You let me think it was me!

756
01:08:26,344 --> 01:08:29,210
Look, it doesn't matter
who killed her, right?

757
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:32,146
I mean, he saw me
and he saw you...

758
01:08:32,215 --> 01:08:34,148
It matters!

759
01:08:34,249 --> 01:08:36,309
I loved her!

760
01:08:37,586 --> 01:08:39,553
Well, don't worry now.

761
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:41,485
You did the right thing
calling me.

762
01:08:41,556 --> 01:08:44,490
I'll take care
of everything, OK?

763
01:08:44,558 --> 01:08:48,618
But you gotta
take care of me, too.

764
01:08:54,367 --> 01:08:56,667
Listen to me, asshole,
this is what's gonna happen.

765
01:08:56,701 --> 01:08:59,226
You buried me in this shit,
and you're gonna dig me out.

766
01:08:59,337 --> 01:09:00,860
You're gonna give me the money.

767
01:09:01,105 --> 01:09:03,665
- What money?
- To pay that motel guy off.

768
01:09:03,741 --> 01:09:05,436
There is no money.

769
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,203
You lying sack of shit!

770
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,870
I don't have it anymore!

771
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:12,171
It's gone!

772
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:14,875
I bought a house!

773
01:09:15,117 --> 01:09:17,277
Half a house.

774
01:09:17,351 --> 01:09:21,549
Near Vegas for Freddie and me.

775
01:09:21,622 --> 01:09:24,147
We're supposed to have a house.

776
01:09:24,225 --> 01:09:26,192
A house?

777
01:09:26,259 --> 01:09:29,659
You bought a house?

778
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:31,389
Get up!

779
01:09:36,168 --> 01:09:38,158
What are we going to do
with a fucking house?

780
01:09:41,138 --> 01:09:42,799
You're gonna get that money!

781
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:45,204
Wait! Wait!

782
01:09:47,376 --> 01:09:49,105
I got it. I got it.

783
01:09:53,848 --> 01:09:55,781
This is what we do.

784
01:09:57,719 --> 01:10:00,687
We go to where
you hid her body...

785
01:10:00,754 --> 01:10:04,314
and we dispose of it
once and for all...

786
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:07,154
where nobody can find it
in a thousand years.

787
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:10,727
Then we don't have
to pay nobody nothing. See?

788
01:10:12,363 --> 01:10:14,525
You idiot!

789
01:10:14,599 --> 01:10:15,530
What?

790
01:10:15,599 --> 01:10:18,158
I never moved her body.

791
01:10:27,175 --> 01:10:28,939
How could you lie to me
about that?

792
01:10:33,247 --> 01:10:35,578
You ate my ear...

793
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:37,844
you killed your wife,
you framed me...

794
01:10:37,918 --> 01:10:41,318
and you're mad at me for lying?

795
01:10:55,866 --> 01:10:58,892
Jesus, what kind of sicko
would take a dead body?

796
01:11:08,309 --> 01:11:11,244
My head...

797
01:11:11,312 --> 01:11:12,779
You really hurt my head.

798
01:11:12,879 --> 01:11:14,312
Shut up.

799
01:11:18,785 --> 01:11:22,241
Better pray I calm
this motel guy down while...

800
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,255
I go to Red's
and ask him for the money.

801
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:26,381
Ask him?

802
01:11:26,457 --> 01:11:27,423
Beg him.

803
01:11:27,492 --> 01:11:29,926
Bear his fucking children
if you have to.

804
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:38,229
You better take this.

805
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:41,268
I don't need it.
I don't want any more problems.

806
01:11:41,369 --> 01:11:43,701
We're talking
about serious stuff here.

807
01:11:43,770 --> 01:11:45,932
You might need it just
to reason with the guy.

808
01:11:46,174 --> 01:11:49,870
You don't have to shoot him
unless you absolutely have to.

809
01:11:53,246 --> 01:11:54,645
Good luck.

810
01:11:55,781 --> 01:11:57,441
Fuck off.

811
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,521
Always burning the midnight oil,
as they say.

812
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,221
Jesus Christ.
This is unbelievable.

813
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:15,854
I was just about
to come to see you.

814
01:12:15,931 --> 01:12:17,454
Here you are.

815
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:21,630
I should come back later.
You're busy.

816
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:23,169
No, I'm finished.

817
01:12:23,237 --> 01:12:26,228
This adding and subtracting
shit you do is hard.

818
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:29,502
It's very hard.

819
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:31,600
I don't pay you enough.

820
01:12:31,677 --> 01:12:33,542
Yeah, well...

821
01:12:33,611 --> 01:12:35,546
What did you want
to see me about?

822
01:12:37,615 --> 01:12:39,310
It can wait.

823
01:12:39,384 --> 01:12:41,874
Naw, it can't.

824
01:13:03,269 --> 01:13:05,237
Well...

825
01:13:09,241 --> 01:13:11,231
I'm in kind of a fix, you know?

826
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,281
I was gonna see
about borrowing...

827
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:20,714
some money, maybe.

828
01:13:20,817 --> 01:13:23,149
You want more money?

829
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:28,691
You think you can fuck
with my books...

830
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:29,850
and I won’t find out?

831
01:13:29,924 --> 01:13:32,415
Who the fuck are you?

832
01:13:32,493 --> 01:13:34,620
I didn't take nothin', I swear!

833
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:39,154
OK, I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

834
01:13:41,368 --> 01:13:43,266
I want it all back.

835
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,668
I'm gonna break
your fucking legs anyway...

836
01:13:45,738 --> 01:13:48,797
but you are going
to give me back every dime...

837
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:52,240
and every seed of every joint
you ever smoked of mine...

838
01:13:52,310 --> 01:13:54,436
that didn't belong to you!

839
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:58,670
I don't have it anymore.
He took the money.

840
01:13:58,748 --> 01:13:59,772
My brother...

841
01:13:59,849 --> 01:14:03,079
I don't give a shit!
You took it first!

842
01:14:03,151 --> 01:14:05,085
He stole it from you,
you steal it back.

843
01:14:05,153 --> 01:14:07,814
I got no beef with your brother.
Thirty-eight grand you owe me.

844
01:14:07,888 --> 01:14:09,822
That's what I figure’s
gone over the past year...

845
01:14:09,890 --> 01:14:11,721
give or take a penny or a pill.

846
01:14:11,792 --> 01:14:12,723
I mean it.

847
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:14,657
If I had it, I'd give it to you.

848
01:14:16,162 --> 01:14:17,823
No! That prick...

849
01:14:17,897 --> 01:14:19,524
Are you listening to me?

850
01:14:19,599 --> 01:14:22,600
I don't care about
your fucking problems!

851
01:14:22,636 --> 01:14:24,567
I look like a fucking shrink?

852
01:14:24,602 --> 01:14:26,570
You tell it to that cunt
Ann Landers.

853
01:14:26,638 --> 01:14:28,105
You do what you gotta do.

854
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:30,537
Sell your mama's blood
for nickels.

855
01:14:30,607 --> 01:14:32,471
I don't give a fuck.

856
01:14:32,542 --> 01:14:33,667
My mama's dead.

857
01:14:33,744 --> 01:14:37,611
Right. Well, I guess
you shit outta luck.

858
01:14:40,883 --> 01:14:42,281
Just let me go.

859
01:14:42,350 --> 01:14:44,317
OK? I'm sorry.

860
01:14:44,386 --> 01:14:45,819
Hey, don't move!

861
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,116
Red, don't move.

862
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:51,156
You fucking shit!

863
01:14:53,593 --> 01:14:57,130
All right... Damn, Red!

864
01:14:57,164 --> 01:14:58,653
Drop the gun.

865
01:14:58,730 --> 01:15:00,254
You drop yours.

866
01:15:00,332 --> 01:15:02,561
I pulled mine out first.

867
01:15:04,268 --> 01:15:07,725
Then, Sam, you're fired.

868
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:13,732
Aw, shit!

869
01:15:17,212 --> 01:15:19,339
Aw, shit!

870
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:22,349
Shit. Shit.

871
01:15:31,258 --> 01:15:33,225
It's forty-six thousand,
you fucking idiot.

872
01:15:33,892 --> 01:15:36,417
You can't count, you bastard.

873
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:54,299
You got here fast.

874
01:15:54,409 --> 01:15:55,807
You said by morning.

875
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:57,491
That's right. I guess I did.

876
01:15:57,527 --> 01:15:59,072
Would you like a cup of tea?

877
01:16:01,115 --> 01:16:03,014
A sandwich?

878
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:05,278
So, where's your brother,
parking the car?

879
01:16:05,351 --> 01:16:07,251
Relax. He's getting the money.

880
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,581
He'll be along.

881
01:16:08,654 --> 01:16:10,747
He'll be along?

882
01:16:10,823 --> 01:16:12,585
- Yeah.
- When?

883
01:16:12,657 --> 01:16:15,183
Look, I just...
I don't want no trouble.

884
01:16:15,259 --> 01:16:17,056
Just relax, OK?

885
01:16:17,128 --> 01:16:18,459
OK, I'll relax.

886
01:16:21,531 --> 01:16:22,793
You relax, too.

887
01:16:29,171 --> 01:16:30,660
What's the matter?

888
01:16:31,740 --> 01:16:33,173
Where you going?

889
01:16:44,250 --> 01:16:46,649
Look, maybe this wasn't
such a good idea.

890
01:16:48,754 --> 01:16:49,845
What the fuck is going on here?

891
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:52,079
Stop it! Stop it!

892
01:16:52,156 --> 01:16:55,648
You took her body, you sick
son of a bitch, didn't you?

893
01:16:55,726 --> 01:16:58,216
You sick fucker, you!

894
01:16:58,294 --> 01:17:01,024
Where is she?

895
01:17:12,639 --> 01:17:15,403
She put us up to it! That girl...

896
01:17:15,475 --> 01:17:16,442
Shut up!

897
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:20,538
I'm really tired
of the motel business.

898
01:17:20,614 --> 01:17:22,637
There's no future in it,
you know?

899
01:17:22,715 --> 01:17:23,647
Inside.

900
01:17:23,716 --> 01:17:26,184
We had our eye
on this really nice RV.

901
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:34,619
It's OK, baby.

902
01:17:34,691 --> 01:17:37,625
Don't worry.

903
01:17:37,693 --> 01:17:39,660
I know it was Sam who killed me.

904
01:17:54,474 --> 01:17:55,771
Fuck!

905
01:18:23,731 --> 01:18:25,425
Oh, shit.

906
01:19:00,161 --> 01:19:01,253
It's OK.

907
01:19:09,069 --> 01:19:10,365
I don't...

908
01:19:12,304 --> 01:19:14,066
I don't get it.

909
01:19:14,138 --> 01:19:16,402
Someone found me
at the side of the road.

910
01:19:16,474 --> 01:19:17,633
Jesus.

911
01:19:17,708 --> 01:19:19,472
Saved my life.

912
01:19:19,544 --> 01:19:24,310
But I saw... I mean, I saw.

913
01:19:24,381 --> 01:19:26,177
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

914
01:19:26,249 --> 01:19:27,773
She's bleeding! Help!

915
01:19:28,016 --> 01:19:29,541
I'm OK. I'm OK.

916
01:19:31,453 --> 01:19:33,478
Sam's a lousy shot.

917
01:19:33,555 --> 01:19:36,079
Even that close.

918
01:19:40,127 --> 01:19:44,994
The bullet went in there
and out there.

919
01:19:47,667 --> 01:19:51,032
Doctor says I was lucky.

920
01:19:51,102 --> 01:19:54,196
I told him
there's no such thing as luck.

921
01:19:54,272 --> 01:19:57,672
It's real, right?

922
01:19:59,376 --> 01:20:01,707
It must be.

923
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:05,110
I mean, I've never felt like...

924
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:08,343
Whatever that word is.

925
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:09,747
Happy.

926
01:20:13,588 --> 01:20:16,385
I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

927
01:20:16,456 --> 01:20:18,754
I don't know exactly.

928
01:20:18,825 --> 01:20:20,314
I blacked out.

929
01:20:20,393 --> 01:20:23,487
I couldn't remember
anything and...

930
01:20:23,562 --> 01:20:26,155
there you were.

931
01:20:26,231 --> 01:20:27,823
I thought I'd killed you.

932
01:20:30,135 --> 01:20:32,102
- Why would you want to kill me?
- I wouldn't.

933
01:20:32,169 --> 01:20:35,730
- What did I ever do to you?
- Nothing.

934
01:20:35,805 --> 01:20:37,739
Just thinking about you
in that ravine...

935
01:20:37,807 --> 01:20:39,274
bleeding to death...

936
01:20:45,513 --> 01:20:47,105
You broke my heart, Jacks.

937
01:20:51,686 --> 01:20:53,084
I was scared.

938
01:20:53,153 --> 01:20:54,780
I was stupid. I was fucked up.

939
01:20:54,854 --> 01:20:57,185
Please forgive me.

940
01:20:58,824 --> 01:21:01,292
Baby...

941
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,089
I've already forgiven you.

942
01:21:25,646 --> 01:21:27,614
- Where are you going?
- I'm hungry.

943
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:30,342
I've got a fucking hole
in my stomach.

944
01:21:30,416 --> 01:21:32,350
You want something to eat?

945
01:21:32,418 --> 01:21:34,579
I'll bring us back something.
You wait here.

946
01:22:05,679 --> 01:22:07,374
Oh, shit.

947
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:12,681
Damn.

948
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:16,020
Here you go.

949
01:22:16,087 --> 01:22:18,078
Can I ask you something?

950
01:22:18,155 --> 01:22:20,021
You want me to throw
that out for you?

951
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:23,184
What? No.

952
01:22:23,260 --> 01:22:25,022
Are you OK?

953
01:22:28,764 --> 01:22:30,493
Can I ask you something?

954
01:22:30,565 --> 01:22:33,089
Go ahead. Shoot.

955
01:22:37,304 --> 01:22:42,104
If you had, you know,
killed two people...

956
01:22:47,713 --> 01:22:50,614
murdered them...

957
01:22:50,682 --> 01:22:55,675
and in the process had gotten
almost a hundred grand...

958
01:22:55,753 --> 01:22:57,721
That's close to
ninety-eight thousand dollars...

959
01:22:57,788 --> 01:23:00,757
which nobody was going
to miss, you hope...

960
01:23:00,990 --> 01:23:05,654
and a stranger
was blackmailing you...

961
01:23:05,728 --> 01:23:08,663
would you give him
a big chunk of that money...

962
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:10,630
you worked so hard to get?

963
01:23:10,698 --> 01:23:14,155
You are weird.

964
01:23:19,807 --> 01:23:22,707
No, I wouldn't give
the bastard a red cent.

965
01:23:22,743 --> 01:23:25,972
Yeah? That's what I think, too.

966
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:27,170
Could you...

967
01:23:29,347 --> 01:23:32,213
bring me...

968
01:23:32,283 --> 01:23:33,749
one of those doughnuts, too?

969
01:23:35,152 --> 01:23:37,051
Yeah, hold on.

970
01:23:42,424 --> 01:23:45,325
Since I'm a regular,
think I could use your phone?

971
01:23:48,162 --> 01:23:50,130
Yeah, but...

972
01:23:50,198 --> 01:23:53,098
don't make a habit of it, OK?

973
01:23:54,401 --> 01:23:55,459
The Suburban motel.

974
01:23:55,535 --> 01:23:57,661
Twenty-one ninety-five.
That includes a color TV.

975
01:23:57,736 --> 01:23:59,226
How can I help you?

976
01:23:59,305 --> 01:24:01,034
Put him on.

977
01:24:03,475 --> 01:24:05,675
- Yeah?
- It's me.

978
01:24:05,709 --> 01:24:08,177
It's about time.
Did you get the money?

979
01:24:08,245 --> 01:24:09,577
I got the money.

980
01:24:09,647 --> 01:24:11,113
Good.

981
01:24:11,181 --> 01:24:12,978
OK, so come on.

982
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:15,451
You should have seen me.

983
01:24:15,487 --> 01:24:17,043
I was great.

984
01:24:17,119 --> 01:24:18,348
So we'll see you soon, right?

985
01:24:18,421 --> 01:24:20,989
He had no choice
when I put it the way I put it.

986
01:24:21,024 --> 01:24:22,979
I made him see it my way.

987
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,389
And, Sam, bring the key.

988
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:26,949
What key?

989
01:24:27,027 --> 01:24:29,393
On top of everything,
he says I owe him 30 bucks...

990
01:24:29,463 --> 01:24:31,225
for the motel key I took.

991
01:24:31,298 --> 01:24:33,765
It's in the fish dish.

992
01:24:33,999 --> 01:24:38,265
The fish dish.
Look on top of the TV.

993
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:41,203
But I'm not at home.

994
01:24:41,272 --> 01:24:43,070
Where are you?

995
01:24:48,545 --> 01:24:50,740
I'll get you another cup.

996
01:24:51,247 --> 01:24:53,011
See ya.

997
01:24:56,285 --> 01:24:58,115
- Shit.
- What?

998
01:24:58,186 --> 01:25:00,347
Stupid machine forgot
to put sugar in my coffee.

999
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,388
This is weird.

1000
01:25:11,063 --> 01:25:13,395
You scream
like you just saw a ghost.

1001
01:25:13,466 --> 01:25:15,524
I'm the one
who just saw a ghost.

1002
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,124
You are a ghost, aren't you?

1003
01:25:18,203 --> 01:25:21,171
I know 'cause I killed you.
I was there.

1004
01:25:25,108 --> 01:25:26,167
You fucker, you.

1005
01:25:26,243 --> 01:25:29,699
What are you gonna do,
kill us all?

1006
01:25:31,513 --> 01:25:35,449
Come on, what's in the bag?
Is that money?

1007
01:25:35,516 --> 01:25:37,212
We can all get out of here.

1008
01:25:37,286 --> 01:25:39,219
Oh, boy.

1009
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,688
You know...

1010
01:25:45,358 --> 01:25:48,383
how does something like this
happen to me?

1011
01:25:48,460 --> 01:25:50,655
All along
it never occurred to me...

1012
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:55,256
that the only reason
that your body was missing...

1013
01:25:58,669 --> 01:26:00,136
is because you weren't dead.

1014
01:26:14,182 --> 01:26:16,149
I gotta keep my head here.

1015
01:26:18,619 --> 01:26:21,644
I gotta do something right!

1016
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:26,685
You know, Jacks...

1017
01:26:26,758 --> 01:26:29,522
why can't it be nice
when you come home to visit?

1018
01:26:29,595 --> 01:26:32,325
Normal, like other families?

1019
01:26:51,545 --> 01:26:53,537
Leave him alone!

1020
01:26:53,614 --> 01:26:54,979
Stop!

1021
01:27:04,624 --> 01:27:06,147
No! No more, please!

1022
01:27:06,224 --> 01:27:08,055
It's all right.
I'm a police officer.

1023
01:27:08,126 --> 01:27:11,095
Drop the gun, Jacks.
Come here, Freddie.

1024
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,995
I'm sorry.

1025
01:27:13,063 --> 01:27:14,552
Come on.

1026
01:27:21,503 --> 01:27:23,596
You drop that gun, Jacks.

1027
01:27:26,507 --> 01:27:28,975
Folks, you mind
stepping outside, please?

1028
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:30,532
This is officially
a crime scene.

1029
01:27:30,610 --> 01:27:32,407
Oh, my God.

1030
01:27:32,479 --> 01:27:35,141
I don't think
I can go through with this.

1031
01:27:35,215 --> 01:27:38,183
You called me, remember?

1032
01:27:38,250 --> 01:27:40,343
There's no turning back now.

1033
01:27:40,452 --> 01:27:41,383
It's done.

1034
01:27:41,453 --> 01:27:43,386
Don't worry. It'll be nice.

1035
01:27:55,231 --> 01:27:57,813
You tried to bury me, Jacks.

1036
01:27:57,847 --> 01:28:00,395
Fuckin'- A. And, Jacks...

1037
01:28:00,468 --> 01:28:02,935
if you're gonna kill someone...

1038
01:28:03,003 --> 01:28:05,062
you gotta kill 'em.

1039
01:29:13,394 --> 01:29:17,125
I could really get
in a lot of trouble for this.

1040
01:29:17,198 --> 01:29:21,463
I'm not supposed to let you in
without Mr. Cos... Custodian.

1041
01:29:22,569 --> 01:29:24,594
Well...

1042
01:29:24,671 --> 01:29:27,002
I won't tell if you don't tell.

1043
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:32,871
Thanks.

1044
01:29:32,944 --> 01:29:34,878
What is your name again?

1045
01:29:34,979 --> 01:29:37,572
Listen, Lloyd,
I am trying to help you.

1046
01:29:37,647 --> 01:29:39,581
I was there. I saw everything.

1047
01:29:39,649 --> 01:29:41,878
Jacks did not kill his brother.

1048
01:29:43,386 --> 01:29:46,116
Listen, I gotta go.

1049
01:29:46,187 --> 01:29:48,053
He's gonna be OK, right?

1050
01:29:59,332 --> 01:30:01,061
Leave me alone!

1051
01:30:01,134 --> 01:30:03,363
I don't know where...

1052
01:30:03,435 --> 01:30:05,303
You promise?
What are you gonna do?

1053
01:30:05,338 --> 01:30:06,531
I'll look into it.

1054
01:30:06,605 --> 01:30:09,699
How?
All my money is fucking gone!

1055
01:30:18,014 --> 01:30:20,278
Oh, oh, jeez.

1056
01:30:20,350 --> 01:30:21,611
There's nothing wrong
with my wife, is there?

1057
01:30:21,683 --> 01:30:24,311
Your wife's fine, Ben.

1058
01:30:24,386 --> 01:30:26,286
She's a little pissed at you.

1059
01:30:26,355 --> 01:30:28,447
We got a call from Freddie.

1060
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:30,047
Freddie who?

1061
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:32,557
And she had some very
interesting things to say.

1062
01:30:34,194 --> 01:30:36,059
She stole all my fucking money.

1063
01:30:36,129 --> 01:30:37,596
Ask this guy.

1064
01:30:37,663 --> 01:30:39,358
Hey, tell him.

1065
01:30:39,432 --> 01:30:41,923
Tell this fucker,
who works for me...

1066
01:30:42,001 --> 01:30:44,094
that she stole
every last fucking cent.

1067
01:30:44,169 --> 01:30:45,295
Tell him, for Christ's sake!

1068
01:30:45,370 --> 01:30:46,529
Come on, hey!

1069
01:30:47,739 --> 01:30:50,104
Look, hey, Lloyd, OK,
we're cops.

1070
01:30:50,174 --> 01:30:52,539
We gotta stick together.
That's what we do.

1071
01:30:54,577 --> 01:30:57,909
If we don't look out
for each other, who will, man?

1072
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,970
Let me ask you something, Ben.

1073
01:31:00,049 --> 01:31:03,176
Why you such
a fucking wick, huh?

1074
01:31:03,251 --> 01:31:05,184
Hey, I got pants up there!

1075
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,488
Hey, listen!

1076
01:31:20,298 --> 01:31:22,323
I suppose
it's none of my business...

1077
01:31:22,401 --> 01:31:25,232
but after all that...

1078
01:31:25,302 --> 01:31:27,668
you sure
this is the right woman for you?

1079
01:31:29,573 --> 01:31:30,597
I don't know.

1080
01:31:32,241 --> 01:31:33,469
Maybe.

1081
01:32:07,103 --> 01:32:09,593
How do you know for sure
she's even here?

1082
01:32:11,573 --> 01:32:12,539
She's here.

1083
01:32:12,574 --> 01:32:15,041
Thanks for the ride.
Appreciate it.

1084
01:32:15,109 --> 01:32:17,475
Take one of these with you.

1085
01:32:17,545 --> 01:32:20,207
I don't have twenty-five bucks
for a Bible.

1086
01:32:20,281 --> 01:32:22,407
- It's a gift.
- Keep it.

1087
01:32:22,482 --> 01:32:24,313
You got a family to feed.

1088
01:32:26,486 --> 01:32:28,385
Don't look so worried.

1089
01:32:28,454 --> 01:32:30,115
Look at this.

1090
01:32:32,991 --> 01:32:35,585
I got a letter from her
not too long ago.

1091
01:32:40,130 --> 01:32:42,496
"Dear Jacks,
maybe it's all bullshit.

1092
01:32:42,598 --> 01:32:45,434
"Maybe nothing does happen
for a reason after all...

1093
01:32:45,469 --> 01:32:47,128
"but I'm doing great.

1094
01:32:47,203 --> 01:32:49,363
"I'm living my dream.

1095
01:32:49,437 --> 01:32:53,065
"So fuck you anyways.
Freddie. "

1096
01:32:55,342 --> 01:32:57,276
I hate to say this, son...

1097
01:32:57,344 --> 01:32:59,243
but that don't sound
exactly like a love letter.

1098
01:33:03,081 --> 01:33:05,276
You gotta read
between the lines.

1099
01:33:06,685 --> 01:33:08,084
Good luck.

1100
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,008
Good night, Freddie.

1101
01:34:33,956 --> 01:34:35,890
What took you so fucking long?
