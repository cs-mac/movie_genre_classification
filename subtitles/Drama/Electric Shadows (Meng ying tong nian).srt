00:20:42,264 --> 00:20:43,424
Make some tea.

168
00:20:43,498 --> 00:20:44,320
Sure, right away.

169
00:20:45,534 --> 00:20:47,502
Well, ha ha ha.

170
00:20:47,569 --> 00:20:50,900
Your trip out here...
it's a long flight.

171
00:20:51,098 --> 00:20:52,333
That's right.

172
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:58,556
Now that you've looked around
and seen the sights,

173
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,456
you like Rome?

174
00:21:00,527 --> 00:21:03,963
Ever since l got off the plane,

175
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:05,225
it's been terrible.

176
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:08,291
Well,you'll get to like it,
l think.

177
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,471
lt's ages...

178
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,975
since l was there.

179
00:21:19,012 --> 00:21:21,003
How are things in Hong Kong?

180
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:22,173
Hong Kong?

181
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:25,082
l'm from the country,
not the town.

182
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:29,350
ln the country-- Hee.

183
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:35,621
- Here. Have some.
- Thanks.

184
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,756
Come on. Drink up.

185
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,132
Thank you.

186
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,133
Here you are.

187
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:48,736
All these tables.
Where are the customers?

188
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:50,703
Ah, Tang Lung.

189
00:21:50,772 --> 00:21:53,070
With all these thugs around,

190
00:21:53,141 --> 00:21:56,406
nobody dares come in here
to eat anymore.

191
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:57,911
Ah!

192
00:21:57,979 --> 00:22:01,380
Tang Lung, some more workers
are out back.

193
00:22:01,449 --> 00:22:02,507
We've got them training.

194
00:22:02,584 --> 00:22:04,518
- Let's go watch them?
- Right. Fine.

195
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:05,518
l'll see you.

196
00:22:05,587 --> 00:22:06,519
Hyah!

197
00:22:07,922 --> 00:22:08,854
Hyah!

198
00:22:11,926 --> 00:22:14,451
There's no work.

199
00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:18,090
So, all the time,
they just practice.

200
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:21,927
- OK, let's go.
- Right.

201
00:22:23,027 --> 00:22:27,464
Before Mr. Chen died,
they all started learning karate

202
00:22:27,532 --> 00:22:29,397
so they could deal
with those damn thugs.

203
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:30,957
How about you?

204
00:22:31,035 --> 00:22:32,969
Ah, it's foreign. Uh-uh.

205
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:34,061
lt doesn't interest me.

206
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:35,969
Ah. Foreign or not,

207
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,669
if it helps you to look out for
yourself when you're in a fight,

208
00:22:39,744 --> 00:22:42,645
then you should learn to use it.

209
00:22:42,713 --> 00:22:45,375
lt doesn't matter at all
where it comes from.

210
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:47,610
You should realize that.

211
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:51,815
Ah, my game is Chinese boxing.

212
00:22:51,889 --> 00:22:53,481
Hey,you know Chinese boxing?

213
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:54,525
Sure.

214
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,389
- Hey, really?
- Mmm.

215
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,724
Hyah.

216
00:22:58,796 --> 00:23:00,024
Huh.

217
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:02,588
Take a break.

218
00:23:02,461 --> 00:23:03,393
Hey,you guys.

219
00:23:03,462 --> 00:23:04,394
Come over here.

220
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:13,065
This is Tang Lung.

221
00:23:13,139 --> 00:23:14,572
Hey, introduce yourselves.

222
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,699
Hi, l'm Tony.

223
00:23:16,776 --> 00:23:18,835
jimmy.

224
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:20,469
Thomas.

225
00:23:20,546 --> 00:23:21,513
Robert.

226
00:23:21,581 --> 00:23:22,513
l've no English name.

227
00:23:22,582 --> 00:23:23,640
just call me Ah Chuang.

228
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:24,648
Hello there.

229
00:23:29,689 --> 00:23:30,849
Come over here.

230
00:23:33,085 --> 00:23:35,553
He doesn't look too great to me.

231
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,349
Hey, can you box?

232
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:41,859
Tang Lung has come from
Hong Kong to help us.

233
00:23:41,927 --> 00:23:44,691
You know, he's a great
Chinese boxer.

234
00:23:44,763 --> 00:23:45,695
- Eh.
- [Laughs]

235
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:47,459
l've just learned a little.

236
00:23:47,532 --> 00:23:49,898
Ah, Chinese boxing.

237
00:23:49,968 --> 00:23:54,064
l have heard that Chinese boxing
lacks any real power.

238
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:57,370
Well,you only lack power
when you're a beginner.

239
00:23:57,442 --> 00:23:58,773
Ha ha. See.

240
00:24:03,849 --> 00:24:04,907
Well, then.

241
00:24:04,983 --> 00:24:06,883
How do you develop any power?

242
00:24:06,952 --> 00:24:09,420
By putting your
whole body behind it.

243
00:24:09,488 --> 00:24:11,615
Like this.
Put your hip into it.

244
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,819
Come on.
Now will you show us?

245
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,013
How do you get your hip into it?

246
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,023
You'll get hurt.

247
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,560
Ha. What?
You're kidding.

248
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,528
Ah, come on.

249
00:24:25,597 --> 00:24:27,929
They're all wearing
some protective padding.

250
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,263
You can't hurt them
with your Chinese boxing.

251
00:24:30,335 --> 00:24:31,632
Come on. Let's go.

252
00:24:31,703 --> 00:24:33,466
OK, get ready.

253
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:38,266
All right then. Come on.

254
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:57,061
Wang: Hey, hold on.

255
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,757
Hey, we got customers
out in the restaurant.

256
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,164
Go and change your clothes.
Quickly.

257
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,534
Ah Gung:
Let's go. Come on. Back to work.

258
00:25:07,749 --> 00:25:10,683
Get change, quickly

259
00:25:11,933 --> 00:25:13,484
Ah Gung, excuse me

260
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:18,285
The toilet?
over there, can't you see the sign?

261
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:19,886
Oh, thanks

262
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:23,183
Excuse me

263
00:25:52,746 --> 00:25:53,780
Get out!

264
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,285
Huh?

265
00:25:56,828 --> 00:26:00,457
Get the hell out of here.

266
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:01,464
Now!

267
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:03,558
Come on.

268
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:18,755
Get out
why?

269
00:26:20,192 --> 00:26:21,856
Here's why

270
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:25,597
What's your decision?

271
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,700
Uncle Wang!

272
00:26:27,227 --> 00:26:29,673
Hey! Come on out here, quick.

273
00:26:29,905 --> 00:26:31,676
The foreigners are here again.

274
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:32,724
Stop! Don't.

275
00:26:33,794 --> 00:26:34,920
Stop!

276
00:26:34,995 --> 00:26:37,327
All right.
But l'll tell you...

277
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:40,390
if you don't give us
an answer by tonight,

278
00:26:40,467 --> 00:26:43,231
we're going to tear this place
into little pieces.

279
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:44,635
Oh, no, no. No.

280
00:26:45,973 --> 00:26:48,737
Huh, Mr. Ho.

281
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,572
Please give us a break.

282
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:52,578
Tell your boss
we need some more time.

283
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:56,138
Ask him to give us a few days more.

284
00:26:56,216 --> 00:26:57,376
You want...

285
00:26:57,451 --> 00:26:59,248
more time.

286
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,878
Owww!

287
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:03,480
You stupid bastard.

288
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,489
Let's have it.

289
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:05,923
So sell.
Or we'll make you.

290
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,927
[All Shouting At Once]

291
00:27:09,363 --> 00:27:10,887
Now, don't fight.
Don't fight.

292
00:27:10,965 --> 00:27:13,399
You'll only wreck
our own restaurant.

293
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:17,369
Remember.
We'll be back for your answer.

294
00:27:17,438 --> 00:27:19,099
Let's go.

295
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:25,677
Oh, oh, oh. Excuse me.

296
00:27:29,636 --> 00:27:31,069
Watch where you're going.

297
00:27:31,138 --> 00:27:32,196
Ah, sure.

298
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:37,176
You're so crazy.
You don't know these people.

299
00:27:37,244 --> 00:27:38,905
Why did Uncle send you?

300
00:27:41,482 --> 00:27:43,609
- Ah!
- Nah!

301
00:27:47,321 --> 00:27:48,788
Tang Lung,

302
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,653
they're young
and very inexperienced.

303
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:51,713
You mustn't blame them.

304
00:27:51,792 --> 00:27:53,589
lt'll be all right, see?

305
00:28:05,678 --> 00:28:07,556
It's lucky they weren't
here at dark

306
00:28:07,557 --> 00:28:08,879
We could've got hurt 

307
00:28:09,026 --> 00:28:11,400
In broad daylight
they don't have the guts

308
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:13,780
All they can do is
crawling around in the dark like rats

309
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:16,600
If Uncle Wang hasn't stopped me...

310
00:28:16,601 --> 00:28:19,900
I'd practiced my Karate on'em
and finished'em up with one chop

311
00:28:21,105 --> 00:28:22,497
These are bold words

312
00:28:23,442 --> 00:28:25,498
What good is your Karate
against guns

313
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,295
It's better than Chinese Boxing

314
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:34,236
He let somebody shove him all
over the place

315
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:37,011
And then he apologized

316
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,698
Come on

317
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,046
Miss Chen:
Please sit down.

318
00:28:49,122 --> 00:28:50,885
Sit down, please.

Menu?

320
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,695
May l help you?

321
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,068
May you help me?

322
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:07,629
Sure.

323
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:13,205
l'd like some Chinese spareribs.

324
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:16,579
Chinese spareribs?

325
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:18,208
You mean to tell me

326
00:29:18,285 --> 00:29:22,551
you--you don't know what
Chinese spareribs are?

327
00:29:24,324 --> 00:29:27,782
Well, let me show you, man.

328
00:29:27,861 --> 00:29:29,294
Unh.

329
00:29:29,362 --> 00:29:31,557
Man:
Hey, what's going on?

330
00:29:31,631 --> 00:29:32,563
Hey!

331
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:34,759
Hey!

332
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:38,905
What are you doing?

333
00:29:38,972 --> 00:29:41,702
You know what we're doing.

334
00:29:41,775 --> 00:29:43,902
Don't they?

335
00:29:43,977 --> 00:29:46,946
You all should have
left this restaurant.

336
00:29:47,013 --> 00:29:49,709
Quick.
Go tell Uncle Wang.

337
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:51,283
Help, get them out of here.

338
00:29:51,462 --> 00:29:52,656
Hey, hey, hey.
Be careful.

339
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,664
Be careful.

340
00:29:54,732 --> 00:29:56,359
Don't wreck our own place.

341
00:29:56,434 --> 00:29:57,992
Don't let them get you riled up.

342
00:29:58,068 --> 00:29:59,660
lt's no use.

343
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:05,466
You. You want to step outside?

344
00:30:05,543 --> 00:30:06,475
Sure.

345
00:30:06,544 --> 00:30:07,476
Good.

346
00:30:10,247 --> 00:30:11,179
Bye.

347
00:30:17,307 --> 00:30:18,754
Tang Lung
Come on!

348
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,923
jimmy!Jimmy!

349
00:30:52,997 --> 00:30:54,362
jimmy!

350
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:56,696
jimmy!Jimmy!

351
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,860
Mmm, Chinese boxing.

352
00:31:00,772 --> 00:31:04,299
Bastard.
We'll get him in the end.

353
00:31:04,375 --> 00:31:05,774
lf only l knew how.

354
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:10,303
He'd see Chinese boxing can beat
any of his barbaric tricks.

355
00:31:10,381 --> 00:31:11,348
Waiter: l'll go.

356
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:12,348
Wait!

357
00:31:20,792 --> 00:31:24,057
We'll show him...

358
00:31:24,128 --> 00:31:26,688
Chinese boxing.

359
00:31:26,764 --> 00:31:32,430
Yeah... Chinese boxing.

360
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:55,645
Movement number 4:

361
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,908
Dragon seeks path.

362
00:31:57,982 --> 00:31:58,914
Hyah!

363
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:02,914
Dragon whips its tail.

364
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,249
Hey! Terrific!

365
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,635
Waiter: Hey, great!

366
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,472
Ah Gung: Oh,yeah!

367
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,966
You did a great job.

368
00:32:55,041 --> 00:32:56,599
Beautiful. Great.

369
00:32:56,676 --> 00:32:58,507
Hey, don't be so overjoyed.

370
00:32:58,578 --> 00:33:00,205
Now that they've been whipped,

371
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:03,112
they'll be screaming for revenge.

372
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:04,114
Ah Gung: So what?

373
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:06,617
With Tang Lung on our side,

374
00:33:06,686 --> 00:33:09,780
now those damn thugs
won't be so keen next time.

375
00:33:09,856 --> 00:33:11,483
Men: Yeah!

376
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,218
You men understand nothing.

377
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,123
You should remember,

378
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:17,059
there's a saying:

379
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,566
Thugs are safest at home.

380
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:24,034
This is their home,
where we are now.

381
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:25,593
We're all foreigners.

382
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,697
All around us is their territory.

383
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:32,006
Now we must be even more careful.

384
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,568
They'll be back,

385
00:33:33,646 --> 00:33:35,477
and we must be ready for them.

386
00:33:35,548 --> 00:33:38,540
Ah Gung: Don't worrt.
Now our dragon has entered.

387
00:33:38,618 --> 00:33:40,347
You'd all better listen to me.

388
00:33:40,419 --> 00:33:42,785
They'll be back for their revenge.

389
00:33:42,855 --> 00:33:44,049
Who cares?

390
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,090
Come on, fellas.

391
00:33:45,158 --> 00:33:46,689
We can discuss it later.

392
00:33:46,839 --> 00:33:48,286
Ah, Tang.
lt's late, and you're tired.

393
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,889
Let's go home now.

394
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,127
All right.

395
00:34:05,796 --> 00:34:07,195
You want to eat?

396
00:34:07,264 --> 00:34:09,357
No. You see,
l want to get up early,

397
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,094
do some training.

398
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:16,231
Uh, can l buy a gun around here?

399
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:18,001
Sure.
Anyone can buy one.

400
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:19,133
lt's no problem.

401
00:34:22,012 --> 00:34:23,502
Hmm...

402
00:34:36,877 --> 00:34:38,845
- Hey, what's that?
- They're darts.

403
00:34:38,913 --> 00:34:39,937
What, darts?

404
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:46,318
Hey. [Chuckling]

405
00:34:46,387 --> 00:34:48,412
- Hey.
- Aha!
- Gee, looks good.

406
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,683
- Come on.
- Dig in.

407
00:34:49,757 --> 00:34:51,486
Hey! Hey, what are you--

408
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,026
What do you think--

409
00:34:53,093 --> 00:34:54,117
What's up?

410
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,662
You're hungry?

411
00:34:55,729 --> 00:34:58,095
Well, if you men think
you're as good as Tang Lung,

412
00:34:58,165 --> 00:34:59,655
you can have this.

413
00:34:59,733 --> 00:35:01,166
But right now,

414
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:02,725
you had better go and practice.

415
00:35:02,803 --> 00:35:05,203
Oh, it's for Tang Lung?

416
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:08,366
Well, why didn't you say?

417
00:35:08,442 --> 00:35:10,876
Tang Lung...

418
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,105
Hmpf!.

419
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,010
lt's always Tang Lung.

420
00:35:17,084 --> 00:35:19,177
- Say, Tang Lung!
- Hey...
- Come on in!

421
00:35:19,253 --> 00:35:20,652
- Have a seat.
- Come on in!
- Tang Lung!

422
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:22,689
Come on down here.

423
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:24,690
- Tang Lung, hi!
- Hi!
- Hey.

424
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:26,487
Nice to see you.

425
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,788
Tang Lung,

426
00:35:27,862 --> 00:35:29,295
this little meal,

427
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,661
l made especially
for our new champion.

428
00:35:31,732 --> 00:35:32,699
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

429
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:34,199
Go ahead.
Go on. Eat up.

430
00:35:37,037 --> 00:35:37,969
Here.

431
00:35:38,038 --> 00:35:39,335
Oh, Tang Lung,

432
00:35:39,406 --> 00:35:40,964
your kung fu is just terrific.

433
00:35:41,041 --> 00:35:43,271
Yeah. Who's your teacher
in Hong Kong?

434
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:45,335
Hey, take a look!

435
00:35:45,412 --> 00:35:47,642
You see? Hup!

436
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:48,909
Ohh...

437
00:35:48,983 --> 00:35:49,483
Hup! Little dragon
finds its path.

438
00:35:49,574 --> 00:35:51,007
Big dragon whips tail.

439
00:35:51,076 --> 00:35:54,534
We beat the foreigners last night!

440
00:35:54,612 --> 00:35:56,910
Hey...

441
00:35:56,981 --> 00:35:59,916
you said that
Chinese boxing was weak.

442
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:04,020
Hey, Tang Lung,

443
00:36:04,089 --> 00:36:05,681
you were too fast yesterday.

444
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:07,315
We couldn't see
what you were doing.

445
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:09,326
Hey, will you show it to us again?

446
00:36:09,394 --> 00:36:10,827
Yeah, come on.

447
00:36:10,895 --> 00:36:12,522
- Let's see it.
- Yeah.
- Come on, man.

448
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:14,394
Yeah, why not?

449
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,026
Let's see the great master...

450
00:36:17,102 --> 00:36:19,332
if he can really do it again.

451
00:36:19,404 --> 00:36:21,099
Hey, come on...

452
00:36:21,172 --> 00:36:23,732
Tang Lung, let's see it again.

453
00:36:23,808 --> 00:36:25,298
- Yeah!
-Join us.
- Come on!

454
00:36:25,376 --> 00:36:26,468
- Teach us.
- Come on, outside.

455
00:36:26,544 --> 00:36:27,977
Yeah, we'd like to see that.

456
00:36:32,283 --> 00:36:33,451
All right, here you go.

457
00:36:33,823 --> 00:36:35,518
Move back, move back,
give him room.

458
00:36:35,592 --> 00:36:36,524
Come on.

459
00:36:39,128 --> 00:36:41,119
Evertone says you're fast

460
00:36:41,197 --> 00:36:42,824
and very poweftul.

461
00:36:42,899 --> 00:36:45,493
Well, l didn't see
those things last night.

462
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:47,001
But you told us,

463
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:50,335
you've got to learn to use
your hips and legs properly.

464
00:36:50,406 --> 00:36:52,499
Well then, let's see you do it.

465
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:55,305
Hey,you keep quiet.

466
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,209
lf you watch,
you'll learn something.

467
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,407
So just get out of the way.

468
00:37:35,769 --> 00:37:36,788
Hey, come on!

469
00:37:37,124 --> 00:37:38,289
Dig him out of there.

470
00:37:38,751 --> 00:37:39,790
Pick him up.

471
00:37:40,297 --> 00:37:41,356
- ls he OK?
- You OK?

472
00:37:45,479 --> 00:37:46,468
Great!

473
00:37:46,547 --> 00:37:50,142
- Tang Lung!
- Yeah!
- What a fighter!

474
00:37:50,217 --> 00:37:52,708
Tang Lung, do me a favor.

475
00:37:52,786 --> 00:37:54,617
How about teaching me that?

476
00:37:54,688 --> 00:37:55,655
Hey, hey,

477
00:37:55,723 --> 00:37:57,554
l thought l heard you say

478
00:37:57,625 --> 00:37:59,820
physical training
was quite useless.

479
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:02,556
That was Japanese karate.

480
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,562
Oh.

481
00:38:03,631 --> 00:38:06,031
This is Chinese, understand?

482
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,067
Chinese...

483
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:09,728
Right.
Then we'll all give up karate.

484
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:12,033
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

485
00:38:12,106 --> 00:38:12,974
- Yeah, right!

486
00:38:13,101 --> 00:38:16,310
Hey hey hey, there are customers

I have to go now
Later we can get together and talk

491
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,403
Hello, is there anything i can do?

492
00:38:42,605 --> 00:38:44,989
Watch out for those thugs
I know they'll be back

493
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,596
My boss wants to see you.

494
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,363
ls he tough?

495
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:12,733
lt looks like we'd better go.

496
00:39:12,804 --> 00:39:14,135
Shut up!

497
00:39:14,206 --> 00:39:16,367
Now move.

498
00:39:23,215 --> 00:39:24,944
[Crack]

499
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,467
Huh!

500
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:45,059

good for nothing...

502
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:05,086
You. Didn't you have a gun?

503
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:07,688
What l like, l get,

504
00:40:07,766 --> 00:40:09,563
and l want that restaurant.

505
00:40:09,634 --> 00:40:11,363
Yes, boss. Yes, boss.

506
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:14,830
''Yes, boss,yes, boss.''

507
00:40:14,906 --> 00:40:17,272
Haven't you wasted enough time?

508
00:40:17,342 --> 00:40:18,274
Uh...

509
00:40:18,343 --> 00:40:19,275
but l...

510
00:40:19,344 --> 00:40:21,778
l always do my best.

511
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:24,914
Then how come you failed?

512
00:40:26,386 --> 00:40:28,377
l found out that they are helped

513
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:30,616
by a man called Tang Lung.

514
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:33,454
A man?
Only one man?

515
00:40:33,526 --> 00:40:34,993
Ahh...

516
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:38,519
But this man knows
Chinese... kung fu.

517
00:40:38,598 --> 00:40:40,828
Kung fu?

518
00:41:29,493 --> 00:41:30,425
Good morning.

519
00:41:30,494 --> 00:41:32,018
Morning.

520
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:33,324
Sit down.

521
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,832
Eat.

522
00:41:42,172 --> 00:41:44,299
ln Rome,you won't
often find such food.

523
00:41:44,374 --> 00:41:46,274
ls it OK?

524
00:41:48,579 --> 00:41:50,877
Hmm.
lt's better in Hong Kong.

525
00:41:50,948 --> 00:41:52,516
Sure, l know that...

526
00:41:52,653 --> 00:41:54,587
but l cooked it myself.

527
00:42:08,435 --> 00:42:09,367
And you?

528
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:11,666
l've eaten.
Want some more?

529
00:42:18,111 --> 00:42:19,510
Hey, after you've eaten,

530
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,706
l'll show you around
the sights of Rome.

531
00:42:21,782 --> 00:42:22,714
Mmm.

532
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:32,789
Oh!

533
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:35,751
Arrh...

534
00:42:35,924 --> 00:42:37,357
Boss: Wait.

535
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:44,436
Over there.

536
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:50,066
Now... ha ha!

537
00:42:56,717 --> 00:42:58,878
Move! Move!
Come on!

538
00:43:02,056 --> 00:43:04,957
Where's the man from Hong Kong,
Lin Chang?

539
00:43:05,025 --> 00:43:05,957
Speak up!

540
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:16,735
Oh!

541
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,101
Trt it! Trt it!

542
00:43:18,172 --> 00:43:19,104
Uh...

543
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:20,105
trt it.

544
00:43:20,174 --> 00:43:21,937
Come on,

545
00:43:22,009 --> 00:43:25,172
you better tell me where he is.

546
00:43:25,246 --> 00:43:26,178
We don't know.

547
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:33,985
Come on.
Where is he?

548
00:43:35,722 --> 00:43:38,122
OK, OK, that's enough.
l'll tell you.

549
00:43:38,191 --> 00:43:39,385
He's coming here.

550
00:43:39,459 --> 00:43:42,155
Well... where is he now?

551
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,169
Look.

552
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:56,333
These monuments are
all ancient Roman relics.

553
00:43:58,845 --> 00:44:00,278
This is...

554
00:44:02,749 --> 00:44:04,478
What's wrong?

555
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,677
Our slums are just like this.

556
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,289
Come on.

557
00:44:35,786 --> 00:44:37,481
This garden was built

558
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:40,148
by an ancient king for his queen.

559
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:43,057
The time and money
it took to build all this--

560
00:44:43,126 --> 00:44:45,993
l think he must've
really loved her.

561
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:51,492
Are you married?

562
00:45:00,777 --> 00:45:03,473
How do you like this place?

563
00:45:06,383 --> 00:45:09,318
lt's a big waste, all of this.

564
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:13,322
ln Hong Kong, l would build on it,

565
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,358
make money.

566
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:18,142
We'd better go back.

567
00:45:24,616 --> 00:45:25,810
Aah!

568
00:45:27,353 --> 00:45:29,184
Close the door.

569
00:45:38,564 --> 00:45:40,054
Ha ha!

570
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:41,622
Better cool it, baby.

571
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:42,928
Bring him down.

572
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,911
Chinese kung fu.

573
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,494
Oh,you must understand the boss.

574
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,559
He really has very good intentions.

575
00:46:13,637 --> 00:46:15,332
With a man like you,

576
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,430
he can appreciate your talent--

577
00:46:17,507 --> 00:46:19,907
Oh... what rippling muscles...

578
00:46:19,976 --> 00:46:21,671
We don't want to kill you.

579
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,372
Oh. Uh...

580
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,039
Here's a plane ticket.

581
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:27,515
just go back to
Hong Kong for a few years.

582
00:46:27,584 --> 00:46:31,884
You wouldn't want any trouble, huh?

583
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:33,445
All right.
Take him out,

584
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:35,184
but be careful with
the gun in public.

585
00:46:35,258 --> 00:46:36,190
Yeah, boss.

586
00:46:36,259 --> 00:46:38,693
Come on, let's go.

587
00:46:54,976 --> 00:46:57,001
Go and see if anybody's around.

588
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,347
Put your hands down.

589
00:47:07,455 --> 00:47:09,047
Put your hands down!

590
00:47:11,192 --> 00:47:12,454
Come on-- Unh!

591
00:47:18,032 --> 00:47:20,023
Ohh...

592
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:22,194
Ooh... oh...

593
00:47:46,661 --> 00:47:48,822
Listen... listen.

594
00:47:48,896 --> 00:47:50,727
Boss, that bastard got away!

595
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:53,198
Go and get him... but no guns.

596
00:48:03,111 --> 00:48:04,703
Get him!

597
00:48:16,758 --> 00:48:18,225
Get him!

598
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:10,186
- Let me get--
- Hyah!

599
00:49:25,636 --> 00:49:26,762
Get him!

600
00:49:33,978 --> 00:49:34,910
Hunh...

601
00:49:34,979 --> 00:49:35,911
Hunh...

602
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:37,447
Hunh... hyah!

603
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,254
Get him...

604
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:49,291
Get him.

605
00:49:59,971 --> 00:50:01,905
Yaaaah!

606
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:23,321
Get him.

607
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:33,864
Go on.

608
00:50:36,536 --> 00:50:38,697
Mamma mia!

609
00:51:13,406 --> 00:51:14,532
Hyah-- Oh!

610
00:51:28,675 --> 00:51:30,905
Ho: Come, Miss Chen,
why don't you quit

611
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:33,241
while you can still afford to?

612
00:51:33,313 --> 00:51:35,008
You better give up.

613
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:36,811
We'll give you a good deal.

614
00:51:36,883 --> 00:51:38,350
There's no way you can lose

615
00:51:38,418 --> 00:51:40,716
by accepting it, huh?

616
00:51:41,788 --> 00:51:43,346
How about it?

617
00:51:43,423 --> 00:51:44,617
Hello.

618
00:52:15,181 --> 00:52:17,081
Let him know...

619
00:52:18,651 --> 00:52:20,744
if l see him here again...

620
00:52:22,989 --> 00:52:25,014
he won't leave alive.

621
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,820
Ho: Uh... uh...

622
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:27,917
Tell him!

623
00:52:27,994 --> 00:52:29,188
Uh... uh...

624
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:30,593
he told us...

625
00:52:30,663 --> 00:52:33,598
not to come and cause
any more trouble.

626
00:52:44,944 --> 00:52:47,936
Get them out.

627
00:52:48,014 --> 00:52:50,574
Hurry up and pick up evertbody!

628
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,548
Hmpf!.

629
00:52:51,618 --> 00:52:52,550
Yeah, go on!

630
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:53,551
Get out!

631
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,848
Come on, get out of here.

632
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,149
Go. Just go.

633
00:52:56,222 --> 00:52:57,154
Come on!

634
00:53:10,138 --> 00:53:11,070
Oh! What...

635
00:53:11,139 --> 00:53:13,573
Hey, Tang Lung, be careful!

636
00:53:13,642 --> 00:53:14,574
They're customers!

637
00:53:14,643 --> 00:53:16,736
Oh... welcome.

638
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:23,010
Come in, come on.

639
00:53:24,653 --> 00:53:25,745
Welcome.

640
00:53:29,824 --> 00:53:31,951
Hey...

641
00:53:32,027 --> 00:53:32,959
Come on now.

642
00:53:33,028 --> 00:53:34,587
Some service!

643
00:53:39,817 --> 00:53:41,614
Now you see?

644
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:43,176
l told you to be patient.

645
00:53:43,254 --> 00:53:44,516
You wouldn't listen.

646
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,284
Now look at that.

647
00:53:46,357 --> 00:53:48,484
You young kids asked for it.

648
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:49,719
So what now?

649
00:53:49,794 --> 00:53:53,093
Let's fight.
We can handle them.

650
00:53:53,164 --> 00:53:55,462
Uh-uh.
You're really crazy.

651
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,467
This is no time for jokes!

652
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:00,868
l know, but...

653
00:54:00,938 --> 00:54:03,202
l know how you feel,

654
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:06,539
but...you must realize,

655
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,977
they also want Tang Lung.

656
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:12,538
Those thugs will do
anything to stop him.

657
00:54:12,617 --> 00:54:13,777
You don't mean...

658
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:16,012
Keep Tang Lung quiet.

659
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:18,078
Tomorrow is New Year's.

660
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:20,089
l'll explain it all to him then.

661
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:22,091
- But...
- lf he refuses?

662
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:24,650
Oh, l know he's stubborn.

663
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:27,493
You must trt to convince him
that it's the best thing to do.

664
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,260
lf we lose him,

665
00:54:29,333 --> 00:54:31,198
we've no chance of keeping
the restaurant.

666
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,600
Oh, we'll see.

667
00:54:33,671 --> 00:54:35,764
We have to... wait a while,

668
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,273
take care.

669
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:39,536
lf there is no other way,

670
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,169
we can just cooperate.

671
00:54:40,275 --> 00:54:41,674
But there's one thing:

672
00:54:41,743 --> 00:54:43,734
We will never sell the restaurant.

673
00:54:46,347 --> 00:54:47,871
Yes...you decide for me.
