00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,800
Based on the novel written by
Jose Maria Eca de Queiroz in 1875

2
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
Aldama México, 2002

3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,800
No, thank you.

4
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,400
- Are you going to Santa Marta?
- No, I'm staying in Los Reyes.

5
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,900
Do you live there?

6
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,600
I'm going to open a store with
my grandson in Santa Marta.

7
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I saved up the money they
gave me for my lands.

8
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
If the store doesn't go well,
I'll cross over to the other side.

9
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,200
- I have a daughter over there.
- That's great. Great.

10
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
- Lights on, asshole!
- Good evening!

11
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,100
- Hands up!
- You're screwed!

12
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,900
What are you looking at?
Damn woman!

13
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,900
Give me the watch, damn it!

14
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,500
Hurry! Hurry, asshole!

15
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
The watch, damn it!

16
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,100
What's this?

17
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,600
- Give it!
- The chain.

18
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't fuck with me! Hurry, asshole!

19
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,200
Okay, let's go!

20
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,100
- Have a nice evening.
- And a good trip.

21
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,300
Here.

22
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
This will help a little.

23
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,000
- What are you doing here?
- Hi, kiddo!

24
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,500
I thought you were in Aldama.
Didn't you get a job?

25
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
- Well...
- What?

26
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,100
I've been hired by <i>El Independiente.</i>

27
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,800
Congratulations!

28
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,300
I came to see you.

29
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,600
- Me or your father?
- You, only you, Amelia.

30
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,600
Now we can get married.

31
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,700
- Someone will see us.
- Come on, let's talk.

32
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,500
- I have to teach catechism.
- Catechism's in the afternoon.

33
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,300
They're preparing for
their First Communion.

34
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,500
And what about me?

35
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,100
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I can't tomorrow.

36
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,000
Of course you can.

37
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,800
Tomorrow at 8:00 mass, okay?

38
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,200
That's it. The game is over. Come here.

39
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,600
Chepina, why didn't you
start catechism?

40
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,100
- These kids!
- Stop playing.

41
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,300
The ball.

42
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,900
Give me the ball.

43
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
We're not going to play anymore.

44
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,800
The ball! The ball!

45
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,500
Excuse me, where can I find
Father Benito?

46
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Thank you. Over there.

47
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

48
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,300
The ball. The ball.

49
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,900
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

50
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,200
So you are Father Amaro.

51
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,700
The bishop told me so much about you
that I was looking forward to meeting.

52
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,500
I was recently ordained.

53
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,400
That's precisely why, because
you are young and tender.

54
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,000
He thinks of a young priest
to temper him in this town.

55
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,100
And then to send him to Rome to study
Moral Theology or Canon Law.

56
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,000
- I just want to serve God, Father.
- Yes, yes, of course.

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,200
That's why he sent you to me, an ogre.
To test you.

58
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,700
Just remember, a priest who barks
doesn't bite.

59
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,900
Come, come, I'll show you
the parish house.

60
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,900
It's no great thing.

61
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,000
Here is the chapel.

62
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,100
The bishop wanted us
to start a seminary...

63
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,300
...for Bible and pastoral studies
with the priests in the diocese.

64
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:19,800
But it didn't work out.
Some of us still meet every month.

65
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,100
The bathroom is there,
and your room at the end.

66
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:32,400
Sanjuanera does the cleaning.
I eat lunch and dinner at her place.

67
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,600
You'll have to do the same.

68
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,900
It hasn't been occupied for some time.

69
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,000
You'll only be here a short time,
if you please me and the bishop.

70
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,300
Thank you.

71
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,000
What's up, Doc? What's new?

72
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,400
I'm just hustling your father.

73
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,900
- Hi, Dad.
- Hello, son.

74
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,400
Weren't you going out with Amelia?

75
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,200
She couldn't.
She had catechism all day.

76
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,200
I told you, son. That girl has her
brain confused by prayer.

77
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,400
Why don't you find
a more liberal girl?

78
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,800
- Not that wafer-eater!
- Priest-hater, it's your turn.

79
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,900
I am going to check you.

80
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,500
Tell me when you want a story
that will rile them up.

81
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:56,500
I'll give you all the information
on the priests in the area.

82
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,500
I've got the dope on all of those fools!

83
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,100
I told you, Paco.

84
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,500
Double check.

85
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,000
Damn it all to hell!

86
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,400
Why do you take advantage
when I'm talking to the boy?

87
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,000
Yes, Don Chato, yes.

88
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,300
I got what you sent, but it's in
dollars and I can't change them.

89
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,800
I would appreciate that, Don Chato.

90
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,500
Yes.

91
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
I'll tell the engineer, Don Chato.
Go on.

92
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,400
Where are you going?

93
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,600
To the bathroom.

94
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
When do you want to have
the baptism?

95
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,100
Yes, Don Chato.
Of course, it will be a pleasure.

96
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,500
I'll be there.

97
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,100
The body of Christ.

98
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,700
God grant you more.

99
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,400
We pray for your help all over the world,
for your message...

100
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
God grant you more.

101
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,300
...and for our Holy Father John Paul II...

102
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,500
...and all of us who are working...

103
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
- God grant you more.
...all of us gathered here...

104
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,100
...fulfill us with your love and friendship.
- God grant you more.

105
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,600
This is the Lamb of God
who takes away the sins of the world.

106
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
Fortunate the ones invited
to the supper of the Lord.

107
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
Lord, I am not worthy to receive you...

108
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,300
...but only say the word
and I shall be healed.

109
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,200
The body of Christ.

110
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:08,800
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

111
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,200
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

112
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,300
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

113
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,900
- The body of Christ.
- Amen.

114
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
The body of Christ.

115
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
Amelia likes the new priest.

116
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,700
- Is that priest new?
- Are you mad?

117
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,400
- I am here, aren't I?
- You never take communion.

118
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:06,300
- I don't believe in that stuff.
- In God?

119
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,800
You care more about mass
than about us.

120
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,500
Do you believe in God?

121
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Maybe, but not the way the priests
picture him.

122
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,200
You're a communist, Ruben!

123
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,400
- Don't be foolish.
- Goodbye, Amelia, God bless you.

124
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,600
I'm home, little Salome.

125
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,400
I brought you your medicine.
The body of Christ.

126
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,000
Amen.

127
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,900
- Tell me if you like the <i>tamarindo</i>.
- Thank you.

128
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,300
Agustina.

129
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,400
Father!

130
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,000
This is Father Amaro.

131
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,900
Welcome.

132
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,800
I'm glad to see you, Father.

133
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,900
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. Likewise.

134
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,700
My daughter told me.

135
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
Very young and very handsome.

136
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,300
Priests are neither young
nor handsome.

137
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,700
We are ministers of the Lord.

138
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,900
What did I say?

139
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,600
Don't pay him any mind.
He's just a grouchy old Spaniard.

140
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,700
But you ended up in the best place
to eat in the whole town.

141
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,100
I have <i>mole de olla</i>...

142
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,600
...and some bean <i>picaditas</i>.

143
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,800
- <i>Picaditas.</i>
- Yes?

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,400
- And for you? Your chicken broth.
- Thank you.

145
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,000
Saturday afternoon we're having
the meeting I told you about...

146
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,300
...with the diocese priests.

147
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,000
The bishop is worried about
Father Natalio.

148
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
He's very headstrong.

149
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,000
Good afternoon, Father.

150
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,900
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

151
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,300
What would you like to drink?
Sangria, a cold beer?

152
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,200
Just water, please.

153
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,000
She's Sanjuanera's daughter.

154
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,500
I wanted to apologize
about the other day.

155
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,900
- I never thought you were a priest.
- Well, now you know, child.

156
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,700
- For you, tequila, right?
- Yes.

157
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,400
I haven't told you about
our construction underway.

158
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,400
What construction?

159
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,400
A clinic on the outskirts of town
for the diocese.

160
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,500
- The bishop asked me to build it.
- I could take him to the clinic.

161
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
No.

162
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,700
Martin will go.
That's what the sexton is for.

163
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Go on.

164
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,900
Is this it?

165
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,400
Wow!

166
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,400
I didn't think it was so big.
My goodness, it's huge!

167
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,000
Father Benito calls it a clinic
but it will be a full-fledged hospital.

168
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,300
Look, come over here.

169
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,800
On this side will be the
old people's home.

170
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:37,200
And over here the orphanage.
And all the rest is for the sick.

171
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,400
The people around here are very
generous with their donations.

172
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,700
Yes, especially the mayor
and his wife Amparito.

173
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,300
- She's very religious.
- Good afternoon.

174
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,300
I see you're a big hit.

175
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,500
Except with my boyfriend.

176
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,000
- The boy you were in mass with?
- Yeah, the big dope.

177
00:16:55,500 --> 00:17:00,400
- Did you break up?
- No, I'm just not in love.

178
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,400
Do you know the only one
I am devoted to?

179
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,300
Just to God.

180
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,600
Oh, that's nice.

181
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,000
Careful! Careful!

182
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,400
- I slipped.
- You okay?

183
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,200
- Yes. I'm fine.
- Yes?

184
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:21,500
- Thank you, Father.
- No, no. Don't do that.

185
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
Good morning.

186
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,800
- Good morning.
- Hello.

187
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,300
Sanjuanera? How are you?
This is Ruben calling.

188
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Is Amelia around?

189
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,700
This is the third time I've called her.

190
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,700
Yes, please tell her I need to talk to her.

191
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:57,100
She has my number, it's 12-34-26,
extension 117.

192
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,000
Yes, tell her I miss her.

193
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
Okay, see you later, ma'am.
Thank you very much.

194
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,700
Divine.

195
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,500
Father, Father.

196
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,200
Now that you know my sins,
I want you to know my virtues.

197
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,100
This is for our Lady's altar.

198
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,600
She granted me a big miracle.

199
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,500
And my husband sends this.

200
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,400
It's for the hospital center.

201
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,300
Thank you.

202
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,200
I am Amparito, at your service.
The mayor's wife.

203
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,400
Thank you.

204
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,900
- Holy Mary.
- Conceived without sin.

205
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,100
Tell me your sins, child.

206
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,900
- Have you no sins?
- Yes.

207
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,700
I confess that I am very sensual,
Father.

208
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,200
What do you mean by sensual?

209
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
Well, I'm very intense.

210
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:43,700
I like to kiss my boyfriend,
and touch myself.

211
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
- You touch each other?
- No.

212
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,100
No, I touch myself, Father.

213
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,300
In the shower, taking a bath.

214
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,900
I like to feel the water falling
on my body, and I caress myself.

215
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,400
Is that a sin?

216
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,100
No.

217
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,200
No, sensuality is no sin.

218
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,400
The body and the soul
are the same essence. It's normal.

219
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,100
But when I caress myself...

220
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,700
...I close my eyes and I think...

221
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,100
What do you think about?

222
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,300
Jesus.

223
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,800
What Jesus?

224
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,800
Jesus, our Lord, Father.

225
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,300
Is that a sin?

226
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,300
Yes, that is a sin.

227
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,700
Her mother died the day she was born.

228
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
It's always been like this.

229
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:57,000
She can't walk. She's like a little animal.

230
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:59,900
And sometimes she has fits.

231
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,200
Is she a girl?

232
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,500
Her name is Getsemani.
That's how Father Benito baptized her.

233
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Can she talk?

234
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,100
When she wants to.

235
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,200
Come on, Getsemani, say hello
to Father Amaro.

236
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
Hello, hello.

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,900
But she understands everything.

238
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,700
Do you think the devil is
inside her, Father?

239
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:29,700
No, of course not.

240
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,900
Father Benito exorcised her once.

241
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,900
What do the doctors say?

242
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,100
They've tried everything
and nothing works.

243
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,600
Not doctors, nor witch doctors.

244
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,100
Now I just give her some pills...

245
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,200
...to calm her down!

246
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,500
That's it, that's it. Look, look.

247
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,100
Do it! Look, look!

248
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,300
- Goal! What a goal!
- No, Father, he was offside.

249
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
- That's a goal.
- He was offside.

250
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,900
You're not even watching the game.

251
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Turn that off, damn it.

252
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,800
- There are only five minutes left.
- Not another minute!

253
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's get to business.
I don't think anyone else is coming.

254
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:27,100
Father Galvan is in the kitchen.
We could finish watching the game.

255
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,400
No matter.
What were you talking about?

256
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,300
The game, Father. What else?

257
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,800
Father Amaro here was giving
us his view on celibacy.

258
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,800
Yes. If celibacy were optional...

259
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,400
...the church would avoid
a lot of trouble, don't you think?

260
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,300
That's bullshit!

261
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,700
You'd sooner see a Mexican pope
than an end to the vow of celibacy.

262
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
Besides, what do we care?

263
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,900
What we care about now...

264
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
...are the accusations against you...

265
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,800
...Father Natalio.

266
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,700
- What is this about, Father?
- Clear the way, gentlemen!

267
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,900
You've never tasted anything like this.

268
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,400
To welcome Father Amaro,
monsignor's favorite.

269
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,300
- Don't say that.
- And why not?

270
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,100
The bishop himself just told me so.

271
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,800
"This is my beloved son in whom
I take great pleasure."

272
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,600
- Don't blaspheme, Father Galvan.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

273
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,100
Help yourselves, help yourselves.
You'll be licking your fingers.

274
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,300
Before we know it, they'll
name him adjunct bishop.

275
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,500
No.

276
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,200
I would like to know what
the accusations against me are.

277
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,900
The effects of your damned
liberation theology.

278
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,600
What does liberation theology
have to do...?

279
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:55,200
The Bishop has exact information,
very precise, Father Natalio...

280
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,800
...that you are protecting or helping...

281
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,600
...guerrillas in your area.

282
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,400
What guerrillas?

283
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,300
You give them weapons,
or hide them for them.

284
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Lies! That isn't true.

285
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,300
There are no guerrillas,
just drug lords.

286
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,900
The Aguilar brothers' drug traffickers.
Chato Aguilar's men.

287
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,500
- I'm talking about guerrillas.
- I'm talking about traffickers.

288
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,800
The kind who invade peasant lands,
force people to plant poppies...

289
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:26,100
...and threaten or kill them
if they refuse to work for them.

290
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,700
Gunmen and drug lords.

291
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,800
They are in my community
and they murder my people!

292
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,200
The bishop knows well of your
helping the guerrillas.

293
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:38,300
Then the bishop knows Chato Aguilar
launders money with donations.

294
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,600
All for your damn hospital center.

295
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,500
- You don't understand anything!
- I understand it all!

296
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,900
I know what goes on in my community.

297
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,300
Well, if you won't listen to me,
face the consequences, Father Natalio.

298
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,200
Don't spoil our gathering, Natalio.
Let's have a good time.

299
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,000
- I'm drunk as a skunk.
- I'll hold him on this side.

300
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,300
One, two...

301
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,000
But how about those <i>chiles rellenos</i>?

302
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,800
- Weren't they amazing?
- Yes.

303
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,500
Especially for you...

304
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,000
...God's favorite.

305
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,000
Thank you, Galvan.

306
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,500
Careful.

307
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:54,900
I would like you to visit
my community...

308
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,800
...up near the mountains,
so you could see how we work.

309
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:01,800
What's that you said
about the donations?

310
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,600
I suspect it, but I don't really know.

311
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I guess I went too far, right?

312
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,500
Excuse me.

313
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,900
Why not anymore?

314
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,800
You know.

315
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,800
But I could come
when he is saying mass.

316
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,100
Don't try my patience, for God's sake.

317
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,300
Or you could come to my house
when Amelia isn't home.

318
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,400
You don't care about me anymore?

319
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,100
Excuse me, Father.

320
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,300
- Do you have any clothes to wash?
- I washed them myself. Thanks.

321
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,200
I'm so glad to see you, Father,
because...

322
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,300
...well, I wanted to...

323
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,700
...ask you a favor.

324
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,000
It's Amelia, Father.

325
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
She broke up with her boyfriend,
who is really a good guy.

326
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,200
And now the poor thing
is crying his heart out.

327
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,100
Where do I come in?

328
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,600
You have so much
influence on her, Father.

329
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,900
Convince her to make up with him.

330
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,600
I'll try. But I can't convince her
of anything she doesn't want.

331
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:55,200
Go on, it won't hurt you to help her.

332
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,700
Make her happy.

333
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Okay.

334
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,100
You're going to get better, okay?
First things first.

335
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,000
The body of Christ. Amen.

336
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,900
- You old bitch!
- No, no, Martin!

337
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,600
No, Martin, no!

338
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm here for Father Benito.

339
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,400
Just a second.

340
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,700
- Father.
- Yes?

341
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,300
Someone to see you.
He looks like a hit man.

342
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,900
Yes, I'm all ready.

343
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,300
- Where are you going?
- To a baptism.

344
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,100
- Where?
- At the <i>hacienda.</i>

345
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,100
What <i>hacienda?</i>

346
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:42,400
Son, you ask more questions
than the bishop. The <i>hacienda.</i>

347
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,700
Tiburón.

348
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,800
Welcome, Father Benito.

349
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,600
Here I am, Don Chato.
Here I am.

350
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,500
- You look well.
- Yes.

351
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,700
- Everything in order?
- Everything.

352
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,500
- And this mess with the dollars?
- I exchanged them at a very good price.

353
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,100
- Where is the little one?
- Over there.

354
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,400
You're going to get stuffed
with succulent barbecue.

355
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,200
I can't eat too much or I won't fit
into my vestments.

356
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,200
Tell me, when are you going
to visit the clinic?

357
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,400
I baptize you with the name
of Maria Elena...

358
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,800
...in the name of the Father and
the Son and the Holy Spirit...

359
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,100
...Amen.

360
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:11,700
Nice pictures?

361
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,900
I'd like to buy some from you.

362
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,900
I'd pay you well.

363
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,100
I'm in a lot of them.

364
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,200
I work for Mr. Aguilar.

365
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,200
I don't even develop them.
I give him the film and that's it.

366
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
That's too bad.

367
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,500
Galarza wants to see you.

368
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
Thanks.

369
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,100
What's up?

370
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,100
Look at this, Ruben.

371
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,800
Chato Aguilar.

372
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,100
And Father Benito.

373
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:18,500
The priest is from your hometown,
right?

374
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,900
How did you get these?

375
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,800
A present someone brought me.

376
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,000
Someone who wants to fuck over
Chato Aguilar.

377
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,200
Chato Aguilar or Father Benito?

378
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,200
I could just publish them
and be done with it...

379
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
...but it's worth investigating.
It's a big story.

380
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,500
Interested?

381
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,400
It's my town, everyone knows me there.

382
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,700
If you don't want to do it,
I'll give it to Ramiro.

383
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,500
It's up to you.

384
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,600
Fuck it. I'll do it.

385
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,400
And not just the hospital center,
there's more.

386
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:03,400
Then the whole construction
is with Chato Aguilar's money.

387
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,800
That's right.
Here are the contracts, costs...

388
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,000
Goddamn, this is a lot.

389
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:10,600
And there's still more.

390
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,300
Here are testimonials
from people in the mountains.

391
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,100
What's that about?

392
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,600
About Father Natalio.

393
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,900
A guy named Natalio Perez who
lives in the hills and joined the guerrilla.

394
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,700
Didn't you know?

395
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,600
No. Hey, but where did you get
all these facts?

396
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,500
Son, a lot of investigating...

397
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,100
...and some help.

398
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,600
You know, I should have been
a reporter.

399
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,200
- Thank you. Could I have more lime?
- Oops. Sorry.

400
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
Forgive me.

401
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,600
<i>Great! This will boost circulation</i>
<i>in a hurry. Damn!</i>

402
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,600
You almost didn't make it, man.

403
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,000
See you around.

404
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,800
Hello.

405
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Here you are, Don Matias.

406
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,800
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

407
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Have you seen this, Sanjuanera?

408
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,700
CHURCH LINKED TO
DRUGS AND GUERRILLA

409
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,900
Holy Mother of God!

410
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,100
And I thought you were the one
paying for the hospital center.

411
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:55,100
What we gave would only
have been enough for a clinic.

412
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,400
But damn Father Benito wanted more.

413
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,800
Did you see who signed the article?

414
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,100
- Ruben.
- What Ruben?

415
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,600
Ruben de la Rosa.
The son of Don Paco, the heretic.

416
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,600
Damn Father Benito, son of a...

417
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,600
You have to do something, Gordo.
You're the mayor.

418
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,000
No way!

419
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:18,400
You have to keep your distance
from priests, like Benito Juarez said.

420
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,600
Father Natalio is late.

421
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,700
You can bet he isn't coming.

422
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:35,800
I told him not to mess with the rebels.
But he was pig-headed!

423
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:39,100
The accusations against him
aren't clear and refutable.

424
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,000
The journalist states opinion, not facts.

425
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,100
He says his people have nothing
to do with guerrillas.

426
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,500
I believe him.

427
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,000
And what about Chato Aguilar, Father?

428
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,600
That's an entirely different thing.

429
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,600
I always thought... have thought...

430
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,500
...that we shouldn't be too picky
about money for good works.

431
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,900
- Even if it comes from Chato Aguilar?
- It's laundering drug money.

432
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,800
The true cleansing
is in the eyes of God.

433
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:21,500
It is bad money that turns good.

434
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,300
Yes, hello?

435
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,600
Yes, speaking, Bishop.

436
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,000
I want to tell you...

437
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,000
Yes, yes, but...

438
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,500
I understand, Bishop.

439
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,400
Yes, yes.

440
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:53,700
As you wish. If you'd like,
I can go tomorrow.

441
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,700
Oh. I'll tell him right away.

442
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,500
Yes.

443
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,900
Conceived without sin.

444
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,600
Do you want me to go with you?

445
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,200
No, not me.
He doesn't want to see me.

446
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,200
He just wants you to go.

447
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,800
Extension 15, please.

448
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,900
You are a son of a bitch, Ruben!

449
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:31,700
Idiot, dope, faggot, damned apostate!

450
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,200
Renegade, asshole...

451
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,800
...two-legged insect!

452
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,200
It was all a lie, wasn't it, Father?

453
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,600
What?

454
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,400
What the newspapers say about
Father Benito.

455
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,300
Pure slander, Martin.

456
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,200
I think the devil came to this town
many years ago, Father.

457
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,900
He built his lair here.

458
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,400
The bishop is expecting you, Father.

459
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,400
Wait here, Martin.

460
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,900
What a joy to see you, son!
Come in, come in.

461
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
Put me through to the mayor
of Los Reyes, Sister.

462
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,700
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

463
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,700
We are here to address
heaven's issues on Earth.

464
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,700
See why I sent you to Los Reyes?

465
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:29,900
That Benito is a calamity.
Look at the scandal he got us into.

466
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:34,100
All because he is so stubborn
about having a first-world hospital.

467
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,400
Did you know about Chato Aguilar,
Monsignor?

468
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,300
Where sin is plentiful, grace
will be more plentiful, son.

469
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,500
Even saints make mistakes.
The important thing is to recognize them.

470
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,100
Don't make a sour face.
For God all things can be remedied.

471
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,000
I already spoke with the director
of that rag.

472
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,000
We're going to publish a rebuttal.

473
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,800
You will write it.

474
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,700
Yes, Sister?

475
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,600
Hello?

476
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,900
Gordo.

477
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,300
The bishop is on the phone.

478
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,600
Those priests. I'm not going.

479
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
No, no.

480
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,800
At your service, Bishop.

481
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,100
No, no. It's just a lot of noise
about nothing.

482
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,900
No, Bishop. Don't say that.
I can't say I gave all that money.

483
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,400
It's in the millions. They'll lynch me.

484
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,900
Oh, that's okay.

485
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,000
If you take responsibility for half,
I'll vouch for the other half.

486
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,500
Fine. Perfect. I'll send the fax
to the newspaper tomorrow.

487
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Yes, Bishop.

488
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,900
See you later.

489
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,800
- Will everything be all right now?
- Yes, yes, yes.

490
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,400
There's no worse politics
than black politics.

491
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,200
Fucking priests.

492
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,700
Don't let your party hear you,
they'll burn you alive.

493
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,500
I govern for the people,
not the party.

494
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,600
No shit?

495
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,700
For his activities, I'll take Father
Natalio out of his community.

496
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,400
He swears there are no guerrillas
in his area.

497
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:36,000
I'll lock him up with the nuns.
Let him take care of them.

498
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,200
- Bishop, if you will allow me an opinion...
- Relax, son.

499
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,800
I know how tiresome all this is for you.

500
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:48,900
But first we have to get the work done.
Then you will come to my side...

501
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,000
...and learn to run the diocese.

502
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:55,200
- Thank you.
- Goodbye, son.

503
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,800
Isn't that excessive?

504
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,100
No, it seems fair to me.

505
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:28,100
What if we decide not to run
your rebuttal?

506
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:30,900
Your newspaper is doing well.

507
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,800
The readers have trusted us for years.

508
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
We always report the truth.

509
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,900
And is truth supported by readers,
or ads?

510
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:48,000
It would only take the bishop
one phone call...

511
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:49,900
...to end the advertising.

512
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,600
He wouldn't do such a thing, of course.

513
00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,300
The rebuttal is to go on the front page,
in big type.

514
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,500
The mayor's statement, well...

515
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,900
...put that wherever you like.

516
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,300
But I can't fire de la Rosa.

517
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,600
I don't want to hurt anyone.

518
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,800
Just find him a job somewhere else.

519
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,200
Come in, Ruben.

520
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:21,500
- You know Father Amaro, don't you?
- Yes.

521
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,800
Well, Mr. Galarza, nice to meet you.

522
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,600
But these are all lies.

523
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,100
What I wrote was the facts,
not this bullshit!

524
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,100
I'm talking to you, asshole!

525
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,400
- Think you can make a fool of me?
- Calm down, Ruben!

526
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,200
- Sit down.
- This is all bullshit.

527
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,800
Sit down.

528
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,900
I'm sorry.

529
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,700
It gets worse.

530
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,800
They're asking for your head.

531
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,900
It was around here
but I don't remember.

532
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:25,000
It's very difficult.

533
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,600
Go on to the curve.

534
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,000
On this side. It's still good.

535
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,600
Can I help?

536
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,200
Please, Father.

537
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,200
There it is.

538
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,400
Done. Thanks.

539
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,700
- Hello.
- I'm glad you came.

540
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,300
You read what they printed
in the newspapers?

541
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,900
Newspapers don't make it up here.

542
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:25,800
Let's go over there.

543
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,500
- Make sure those are tight, Lucas.
- Okay.

544
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:30,900
Excuse me.

545
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:42,500
Thank you.

546
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,700
Benito looks good.

547
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,300
He's photogenic.

548
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,800
With his buddy, Chato Aguilar.

549
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,000
That misunderstanding
has been settled.

550
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,400
Really?

551
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,700
You believe that?

552
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,400
Then the rest is also
a misunderstanding.

553
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,400
There are no guerrillas here.

554
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,300
But people have to defend
themselves.

555
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,300
Yes, I believe you.

556
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,900
But I'm not speaking for myself.

557
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,400
I'm speaking for the bishop.

558
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,400
What's this?

559
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,800
"A decision..."

560
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:35,100
Can you imagine me
in a convent full of nuns?

561
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,800
I'd drink all the eggnog.

562
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,600
It's an order from your bishop.

563
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,800
I don't give a shit.

564
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,600
You are bound to obedience, Natalio.

565
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,000
My only obedience is to God,
and to my people.

566
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:53,400
Come up here for a few days.

567
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:55,100
Come on.

568
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,100
So you can see how we follow
the gospel to the letter.

569
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:05,500
You could be suspended.

570
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
Maybe excommunicated.

571
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:14,000
No. Tell the bishop I said no.

572
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:17,100
He can do whatever
the hell he wants.

573
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,200
Saint Paul tells us:

574
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,400
"When Jesus rises up in heaven
with his powerful angels...

575
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,100
...in a tongue of flame...

576
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,300
...and takes vengeance on those
who know not God...

577
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:55,500
...and do not obey the gospel
of our Lord Jesus...

578
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,100
...they will suffer eternal pain
and ruin...

579
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:02,300
...far from the presence of the Lord...

580
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,900
...and the glory of his power."
- He's right.

581
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:07,300
Dear brothers...

582
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,600
...slander and defamation...

583
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,400
...have fallen like a deluge...

584
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:16,800
...the confused mind
of a brother of ours.

585
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,300
Our neighbor has chosen to smear
the good and noble actions...

586
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,400
...begun by Father Benito.
- Bastards.

587
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,000
All the worst for him.

588
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,500
Because our Lord will judge him
when his time comes.

589
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,500
Let us be understanding.

590
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,900
Because the Lord tells us:

591
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,800
Do not allow this evil to conquer you.

592
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,000
On the contrary, conquer evil
with goodness.

593
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,100
Goodness?

594
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,500
- What? What?
- Today we can be thankful to God...

595
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:52,600
...because the slander
did not trouble our consciences.

596
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:55,800
In the face of slander, shines truth.

597
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,100
In the face of hatred, shines love.

598
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:04,100
- Amid blasphemy, shines forgiveness.
- Forgiveness?

599
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:06,700
We mustn't forgive.
We can't allow that.

600
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:09,200
- Long live Father Benito!
- Silence!

601
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:12,500
- Heretics! You're a bunch of heretics!
- Be quiet!

602
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,700
- You be quiet!
- Dionisia!

603
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:53,500
What racket.

604
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,100
Calm down. Calm down!

605
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:08,400
Heretics!

606
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:09,900
Don't be crazy!

607
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,800
Heretics! Heretics!

608
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,500
- Heretics!
- Long live Christ the King!

609
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,900
- I have stuffed crab.
- I want my <i>chalupas,</i> like always.

610
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:30,300
Oh, Don Matias,
I'll get them in a moment.

611
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:31,800
- Good evening.
- Come in.

612
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,700
- Where is Father Benito?
- He doesn't feel well.

613
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,600
- What?
- It's nothing serious.

614
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,000
No, I still have to go see him.

615
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,900
Tell Amelia to take charge.
Excuse me.

616
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:46,000
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Father.

617
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,500
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

618
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,700
How are you, Father?

619
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,500
I so wanted to see you.

620
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,800
Very upset and hurt
by all that's happened.

621
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,200
The people went too far.

622
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,400
Don Paco deserved it.
He started the whole thing.

623
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,400
Don't say that, Amelia.

624
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:14,200
Luckily it wasn't serious.

625
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,300
How is Ruben?

626
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,500
I don't know.

627
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,700
And I don't care.

628
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,700
My chalupas, Amelia.
What's the problem?

629
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,400
Nothing serious.
This time it's not the heart.

630
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,900
He's severely depressed,
but he'll come out of it soon.

631
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,700
With two days rest and spirit.

632
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,700
Keep up your spirits, Father.

633
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,800
- See you later.
- Thank you, doctor.

634
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,900
I'll stop by your office
to pay you later.

635
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,100
You see?

636
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:18,700
When will you learn?

637
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:24,000
It's the price I must pay for my sin.

638
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:26,000
What sin?

639
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,900
Ours.

640
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:30,000
Now wait just a minute.

641
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:32,200
When Cipriano left me...

642
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,300
...who was the only one
who helped me? Remember?

643
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:36,500
You.

644
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,900
I brought you to wallow in my bed.

645
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:42,300
You gave me back my life.

646
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,900
I made you into the priest's whore.

647
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,400
And for that love, I shall go to hell.

648
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:54,100
Listen to me. What was it
you told me about hell?

649
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,700
You don't remember, do you?

650
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:02,600
The only hell is loneliness.

651
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:06,100
Did I say that?

652
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,000
That's what you told me.

653
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:13,700
I hope God sees it that way,
Agustina.

654
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,600
There, there, stop thinking.

655
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,200
You need to rest.

656
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,800
Why don't you close your eyes?

657
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,800
Maybe you can sleep for a little while.

658
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,600
If not for Doc, I wouldn't have known.
That's what telephones are for.

659
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,300
Why should I have told you?

660
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,700
I didn't want you to come in
this time of fanatical crusaders.

661
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,900
Just like living under Franco!

662
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,100
Well, I'm coming to get you.

663
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,700
- To take you to the city.
- Are you crazy?

664
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,000
- You'll get better treatment.
- I'm not moving from here at all.

665
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,500
Oh, Dad.

666
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:13,900
What's the matter?

667
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:17,800
You haven't gotten a job?

668
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,700
Oh, God. Come on, don't act
like a victim, son. Lift your head up.

669
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,300
Lift your head up.

670
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,700
Smile.

671
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,300
That's it.

672
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:38,900
What you have to do is get a job
at a newspaper with big circulation.

673
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,800
Because I have some news
about the priests...

674
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,600
You're going to fall over!

675
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:47,100
Remember Father Natalio,
the guerrilla?

676
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,700
Yes.

677
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:52,100
Well he confronted the bishop.
And what do you think?

678
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,000
- Now they want to excommunicate him.
- Wow!

679
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,800
- Cheers to Father Natalio!
- Cheers.

680
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,100
Amelia!

681
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,800
Let go of me!

682
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,400
- Let's talk.
- I don't want anything with you!

683
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,600
- Get lost!
- Wait.

684
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:22,100
Don't you get it? I loathe you!

685
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,700
That's not true.

686
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,400
- Do you feel better, Father?
- Better, better.

687
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:36,800
I'm not numb anymore.

688
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,000
Defend yourself, you son of a bitch!

689
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,200
Come on, faggot!

690
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,100
- Come on, asshole!
- My goodness!

691
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:51,700
Fucking priest, don't you have any balls?
Just you and me! Shithead priest!

692
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,400
Come on, asshole!

693
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,100
Son of a bitch!

694
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,800
You fucked up, Rubencito.

695
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,800
We're putting you away for three weeks,
or more.

696
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:07,000
No, it's okay. I'm fine with this.

697
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,500
Thank you.

698
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:13,500
Ready to make your statement, Father?

699
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,400
No, I'm not going to press charges.

700
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,800
I forgive you, Ruben.

701
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,600
Are you crying?

702
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,700
Over Ruben?

703
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,600
No, over you.

704
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Over all you have suffered
without complaining.

705
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:26,500
In the name of the Father
and the Son and the Holy Ghost...

706
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,400
- Go in peace.
- Amen.

707
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,700
- Mary, Mother of God.
- Conceived without sin.

708
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,400
- I absolve...
- Father!

709
01:00:35,600 --> 01:00:38,700
- What?
- What do you mean, "what"?

710
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:47,800
- Tell me your sins.
- You know them.

711
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,700
What about yours?

712
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:56,500
- Forgive me, I was out of line.
- What do you think about love?

713
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:04,500
Love is the motor of the world,
Amelia.

714
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:08,600
Love believes everything...

715
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:10,800
...expects everything...

716
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,400
...bears everything.

717
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,800
- Saint Paul says in Corinthians...
- Stop playing dumb!

718
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:19,700
About our love.
What do you think about that?

719
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:29,100
It is a gift.

720
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,100
God blesses us through this love.

721
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,100
We have to be careful.

722
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,000
People wouldn't understand.

723
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,300
Go on, now. Go.

724
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,700
Martin.

725
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,400
Were you planning on going out, Father?
The distributor isn't working.

726
01:02:38,300 --> 01:02:41,600
No, no, I was just taking a walk
around here.

727
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:49,100
Father Benito should buy another truck,
don't you think?

728
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,600
El Gato is selling one.

729
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,200
How is Getsemani doing?

730
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,700
Getsemani?

731
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:01,300
- Have you taken her to the doctor?
- Yes.

732
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,200
He gave her some medicine.

733
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,200
Do you want to come in?

734
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:09,300
I'd like that.

735
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:24,000
Hello.

736
01:03:35,500 --> 01:03:38,400
What about that room?
Are you using it?

737
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,000
My son Lencho would stay here...

738
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,600
...when he'd come to Los Reyes.

739
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,900
Martin, I want to ask you a favor.

740
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:57,100
- Do you know Amelia?
- Sanjuanera's daughter.

741
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:59,200
Yes, a very pious child.

742
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:02,800
She wants to become a nun.

743
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:06,700
She doesn't want anyone to know.

744
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,800
And I offered to prepare her,
and, well, in secret...

745
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,200
...but I don't have a place.

746
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:15,900
It could be here.

747
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:21,600
- Already?
- Yes.

748
01:04:22,600 --> 01:04:24,600
You look happy, child.

749
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm so glad you finally decided...

750
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,200
...to tell that Ruben to bug off.

751
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:33,900
It was about time.

752
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:40,200
The cheese, child. Here.

753
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,400
- Excuse me.
- Thank you, sweetie.

754
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:46,200
- You're welcome.
- Delicious.

755
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:47,800
- Cheese?
- Yes, thank you.

756
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:49,600
Pardon my hand.

757
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:54,700
- Cheese?
- No, no thank you.

758
01:04:55,900 --> 01:04:58,500
- You need anything?
- Nothing, thank you.

759
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:01,500
- What a lovely girl.
- Very pious, intelligent...

760
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,300
...and church-going.

761
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,900
Did I tell you, Father?

762
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,900
Amelia is going to give Getsemani
catechism classes. Aren't you, Amelia?

763
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,400
What poppycock!

764
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:15,400
- Who is Getsemani?
- A retarded child.

765
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,100
She doesn't understand a thing.
The poor wretch can't even talk.

766
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,900
All the more merit.

767
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,600
You're wasting your time, child.

768
01:05:23,700 --> 01:05:27,000
- You won't last a week.
- The feeble-minded need God too.

769
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,300
Don't they, Father Galvan?

770
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,600
Yes, yes, of course.
We all need God.

771
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,000
- Want some more <i>horchata</i>?
- Yes, thank you.

772
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,900
I found a place.

773
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:15,800
Look.

774
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:18,000
This one is the Holy Spirit.

775
01:06:18,300 --> 01:06:20,200
See his little wings?

776
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,100
This is the Virgin Mary.

777
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,900
And this one is Jesus...

778
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,500
...the baby.

779
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:33,200
Look, this man with a beard...

780
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,100
Look at him, he's God.

781
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,200
Look closely at the drawings and
I'll be back to tell you the story. Okay?

782
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:44,700
Look at them.

783
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,600
<i>As the lily among thorns</i>

784
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,000
<i>So is my beloved among maidens</i>

785
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:37,100
<i>Thy hair</i>

786
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,700
<i>Is as a flock of goats that appear</i>
<i>From Mount Gilead</i>

787
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,400
<i>Thy lips are like a ribbon of scarlet</i>

788
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:53,000
That's from the <i>Song of Songs.</i>

789
01:07:56,800 --> 01:07:59,000
It's a holy book.

790
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:33,000
<i>Thy two breasts are like two young roes</i>
<i>That are twins</i>

791
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,000
<i>Which feed among the lilies</i>

792
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:39,200
<i>The joints of thy thighs are like jewels</i>

793
01:08:39,900 --> 01:08:41,400
<i>Thy navel</i>

794
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:45,800
<i>Is like a round goblet</i>
<i>Which wanteth not liquor</i>

795
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:52,000
<i>Thy belly is like a heap of wheat</i>
<i>Set about with lilies</i>

796
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,600
<i>A fountain of gardens</i>

797
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:58,600
<i>A well of living waters</i>

798
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,200
<i>And streams from Lebanon</i>

799
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:07,100
<i>Thy lips, o my spouse</i>
<i>Drop as the honeycomb</i>

800
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:12,900
<i>Honey and milk are under thy tongue</i>

801
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:19,300
<i>And the smell of thy garments</i>
<i>Is like the smell of Lebanon</i>

802
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:07,600
<i>The commandments of the law</i>
<i>of God are 10.</i>

803
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,700
<i>The first: Thou shall love God</i>
<i>above all things.</i>

804
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:20,000
The second: Thou shall not take
the name of the Lord in vain.

805
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:24,400
The third: Thou shall observe
the holy days.

806
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:29,800
The fourth: Thou shall honor
thy father and thy mother.

807
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:33,300
The fifth: Thou shall not kill.

808
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,100
The sixth: Thou shall not fornicate.

809
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:38,400
- The seventh...
- Miss!

810
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,600
What does thou shall not "formicate"
mean?

811
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:47,700
It means that you don't eat meat
during holy week, Chente.

812
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,100
- The seventh.
- The seventh...

813
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,200
Leaving, Father?

814
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:57,200
- I have to visit someone who is sick.
- I came for confession.

815
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:01,400
I brought you a present.
I made it for the altar to the Virgin.

816
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:04,300
It's lovely. I'll take it.
Thank you, Amparito.

817
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,800
- Thank you.
- Come visit me at my house some time.

818
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,500
Good afternoon, Father.

819
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:42,000
- Wait a minute.
- What?

820
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,100
- No.
- What?

821
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:54,900
Let me see it on you.

822
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:56,900
Yes?

823
01:12:14,500 --> 01:12:16,500
You are more beautiful
than the Virgin.

824
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,000
I don't want any more scandals.

825
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,500
Just imagine if the newspapers
do another number on us.

826
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,000
Be patient with him, Bishop.
Father Natalio is acting in good faith.

827
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,300
I've given him more than enough
time to come around.

828
01:12:48,400 --> 01:12:51,600
- May I express an opinion?
- Of course, son.

829
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:54,600
That's why I call you, to advise me.

830
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:58,200
If you send him to some other
peasant community...

831
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:01,300
...in another diocese,
I think he would accept.

832
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,000
You're too good.

833
01:13:04,300 --> 01:13:07,600
Well, give me time for God
to enlighten me.

834
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:15,300
Did you tell the Bishop
about the child Amelia?

835
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,800
What?

836
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:22,100
- That you are preparing her, as a nun.
- Oh, yes.

837
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:27,700
We talked a long time in confidence.

838
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:31,400
I think the Bishop would like
the Order of the Clares for her.

839
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:35,100
How is she doing?

840
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:36,700
Who?

841
01:13:38,500 --> 01:13:40,300
The child Amelia.

842
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:43,500
With her studies, I mean.

843
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:48,000
Fine. She seems to have a vocation.

844
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,800
I want to love you without hiding.
In front of everyone.

845
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:09,500
No, it can't be done.

846
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:11,600
Our love is unique.

847
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:14,800
What?

848
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,800
It's spiritual, right?

849
01:14:18,500 --> 01:14:21,900
No. It's carnal.

850
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:26,300
I know, the flesh and the spirit are
one and the same essence.

851
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:29,700
But it isn't true.

852
01:14:32,700 --> 01:14:35,900
Lots of priests hang up
their cassocks and marry.

853
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,100
Well, I won't.

854
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,000
Why not?

855
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:43,900
- We could go far away.
- Where?

856
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,700
- Anywhere.
- For what?

857
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:49,600
So I could end up teaching civics?

858
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:53,200
What about all my studies?

859
01:14:56,900 --> 01:14:58,900
That's not the important thing.

860
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,600
No, the important thing is my vocation.

861
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,500
Besides, I can do so much for people
as a priest.

862
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,400
Martin.

863
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,600
Do you know the Clare nuns, Father?

864
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:51,000
I think they have a convent
in Santa Marta. Why?

865
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,900
Because little Amelia wants
to become a nun with them.

866
01:15:56,300 --> 01:15:58,400
Amelia, a nun?

867
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:03,400
That's what Father Amaro said.

868
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:06,900
He has been preparing her
for a long time.

869
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,900
For a long time? Where?

870
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:15,000
In a little room, out by the workshop.

871
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,800
He says it's a secret.

872
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,700
Where is he?

873
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,900
She's just a child. Didn't you notice?

874
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,700
We both know what we are doing.

875
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,000
- You are a priest.
- I'm also a man.

876
01:16:55,700 --> 01:16:58,800
- You took a vow of chastity.
- Because I was forced to.

877
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,100
I'm going to have to inform the bishop.

878
01:17:08,900 --> 01:17:12,300
- No, you won't say anything, Father.
- Just wait and see.

879
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:15,400
Then I will tell him what I know
about Sanjuanera.

880
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,700
It's not the same thing, damn it!

881
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,000
Sanjuanera is different.

882
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,000
- That poor woman...
- It's the same, Father.

883
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:27,000
Are you blackmailing me?

884
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:48,200
The host is sacred!

885
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,100
You'll be damned, you little brats!

886
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,000
Blessed and praised be the host
consecrated unto God...

887
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:57,900
Guess who called my boyfriend?

888
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,500
- Who?
- Ruben.

889
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,000
He said he's working at another
newspaper in Mexico City.

890
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,800
- What's that to me?
- You still hate him?

891
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:08,400
I do.

892
01:18:08,500 --> 01:18:10,000
- Why so much...?
- Amelia!

893
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,300
I'll see you.

894
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,200
I need to talk to you.

895
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,100
- We have to find another place.
- I'm pregnant.

896
01:18:28,300 --> 01:18:29,400
Are you sure?

897
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,700
Is that all you can say to me?

898
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:03,400
May I talk to you, Father?

899
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,300
To confess?

900
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:14,000
No, I just want to talk.

901
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:18,900
You're in big trouble, boy.

902
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:25,700
I do want to confess.

903
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,100
Father, I have sinned.

904
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,500
Hail Mary, full of grace.

905
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,900
I have lied.

906
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:48,700
I have committed the sin of pride.

907
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:53,600
I abused the trust of people
who opened their house to me.

908
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:59,500
Like Herod, I chopped off
innocent heads.

909
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:03,200
I have offended God.

910
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,300
I have committed the sin of lust.

911
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,700
I fornicated with a virgin
who was a child!

912
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:21,300
- He must go to Mexico City immediately.
- I'll go with him.

913
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:24,400
How are we going to get him
to Mexico City now?

914
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:27,100
It is quite a severe coronary.

915
01:20:27,100 --> 01:20:29,600
But how can we take him by plane?

916
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,300
By anything, but hurry.

917
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:33,100
- From where?
- Figure out where.

918
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:36,800
Hello? Put me through
to Don Chato, please.

919
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,800
- Mr. Chato Aguilar.
- You can't call him.

920
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,300
- Father Benito.
- No!

921
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,500
We're talking about his life!

922
01:21:05,700 --> 01:21:09,400
Be careful, son. He's very fragile.

923
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,700
It looks bad, really.

924
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,600
We'll get in touch later.

925
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:48,100
I'm giving you just enough time
to find another job.

926
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,600
I didn't want to hurt you, Father.

927
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:55,400
By the time Father Benito gets back
there will be another sexton here, okay?

928
01:22:20,900 --> 01:22:23,300
You haven't been to the restaurant.

929
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,000
Nor you to mass.

930
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,700
We have to talk about my pregnancy.

931
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:35,200
- Have you told your mother?
- No one.

932
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,700
I don't know what to do.
I can't think.

933
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:43,600
You could go to Villa Aldama.

934
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:48,200
Stay there nine months and
put the baby up for adoption.

935
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,800
Is that what you want?

936
01:22:58,300 --> 01:23:02,500
- For me to give my baby away?
- Listen to me, Amelia.

937
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:04,800
I'm a priest.

938
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,200
I can't jeopardize my priesthood.

939
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,300
Besides, you knew that from
the beginning.

940
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,000
No!

941
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:22,200
I'll have my baby here!
I don't care if everyone knows it's yours!

942
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:24,400
- Don't say stupid things.
- It is yours!

943
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:27,800
Shut up, you dumb bitch!
Shut up! Shut up!

944
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,100
Forgive me.

945
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:38,200
Forgive me.

946
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,400
Forgive me.

947
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:24,800
Ruben is here.

948
01:24:25,800 --> 01:24:27,400
Ruben your boyfriend?

949
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:36,100
He's working in Mexico City.
He came to see his father.

950
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,500
Have you seen him?

951
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:48,200
Maybe he'll want to marry me.

952
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,800
Would you like that?

953
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,800
To save my baby, I would do anything.

954
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:42,700
Hello.

955
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:44,700
Hello.

956
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:48,700
What are you doing here?

957
01:25:49,500 --> 01:25:51,400
Can I talk to you?

958
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:59,100
Could you forget it all?

959
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:02,800
I've forgotten it.

960
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,300
You wanted to marry me, remember?

961
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:16,900
Yes.

962
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,000
I would have done anything for you.

963
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:23,700
Not anymore?

964
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,800
Take me to Mexico City with you.

965
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,600
You don't love me anymore, do you?

966
01:26:41,500 --> 01:26:43,800
No, not anymore.

967
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,900
My love ended.

968
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,500
- Forgive me for blurting it out like this.
- That's okay.

969
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:04,600
Of course I'm worried
about his condition.

970
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,900
But alas, only God knows, son.

971
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,500
Father Benito has fulfilled
his mission on earth.

972
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:15,100
Let me know when you hear anything.

973
01:27:17,900 --> 01:27:22,800
Meanwhile, you take over his affairs.

974
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:28,900
You understand, right? We're going to
renew construction on the hospital.

975
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,100
No, no, no.

976
01:27:30,200 --> 01:27:34,700
What concerns me most right
now is Father Natalio.

977
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:39,900
If he won't accept another diocese,
I can't wait any longer.

978
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:44,900
If you can't sort it out, who can?

979
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:47,500
Excommunication, son.

980
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:51,400
A decree to be read in all the churches...

981
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:53,700
...and all over the country.

982
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,100
He won't even be able to get
into the rural schools.

983
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:01,100
You must deliver it to him personally.

984
01:28:01,100 --> 01:28:04,600
And we'll see.
Either he gives in or he's fucked.

985
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,100
Let me know.

986
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:08,100
Yes.

987
01:28:33,400 --> 01:28:35,400
Did you talk to Ruben?

988
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,300
Yes.

989
01:28:40,100 --> 01:28:41,800
Yes, of course.

990
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:49,200
I have a suggestion, Amelia.

991
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,400
Do you know where Dionisia lives?

992
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,800
Here?

993
01:29:04,100 --> 01:29:05,200
Good evening.

994
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,100
Good evening.

995
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:11,900
Dionisia?

996
01:29:13,700 --> 01:29:15,700
What a surprise! What an honor!

997
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:18,500
Come in, Father dear, come in.

998
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:21,800
Look, this is my private church.

999
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,100
Let me introduce you to my saints.

1000
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:29,800
Here is my Saint Anthony, Saint Joseph,
my Virgin of Guadalupe...

1001
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,800
- Sit down, Father.
- I'm in a hurry.

1002
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:34,000
Yes.

1003
01:29:36,100 --> 01:29:37,900
And how is the little girl?

1004
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:42,800
Happy.

1005
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:48,200
Listen, I heard in confession
that you know a doctor...

1006
01:29:48,100 --> 01:29:49,800
A doctor, I don't know...

1007
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,500
One of those who does...

1008
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:00,300
Does what, Father?

1009
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:05,300
Brings children into the world.

1010
01:30:06,900 --> 01:30:10,000
- And also...
- Mother of God! The girl is pregnant?

1011
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:11,400
No.

1012
01:30:15,200 --> 01:30:18,600
What you want is an abortion, Father.

1013
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:27,700
I don't know if this is enough.

1014
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:32,000
No, it takes a lot more. But don't worry.

1015
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:35,200
We'll settle up later.
First let me see.

1016
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:38,500
- Yes.
- I'll let you know in time.

1017
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:42,200
God bless you, Father.

1018
01:30:43,200 --> 01:30:44,600
Yes.

1019
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,600
Excuse me.

1020
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:33,000
- Mother of Jesus.
- Pray for him.

1021
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,500
- Mother of divine grace.
- Pray for him.

1022
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,500
- Tower of David.
- Pray for him.

1023
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,500
- Tower of ivory.
- Pray for him.

1024
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:41,700
- House of gold.
- Pray for him.

1025
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,300
- Heaven's gate.
- Pray for him.

1026
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:45,500
- Refuge for sinners.
- Pray for him.

1027
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,100
- Consolation of the afflicted.
- Pray for him.

1028
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:49,400
- Aid for Christians.
- Pray for him.

1029
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:51,500
- Queen of angels.
- Pray for him.

1030
01:31:51,700 --> 01:31:53,500
- Queen of the apostles.
- Pray for him.

1031
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,700
- Queen of the patriarchs.
- Pray for him.

1032
01:31:55,800 --> 01:31:57,700
- Queen of all the saints.
- Pray for him.

1033
01:31:57,700 --> 01:31:59,900
- Queen of the apostles.
- Pray for him.

1034
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,700
- Queen of prophets.
- Pray for him.

1035
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:04,400
They found Lucas in a canyon.

1036
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,800
Three years ago they killed
his father and two brothers.

1037
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,900
Chato Aguilar's men.

1038
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:13,600
What about the municipal guards?

1039
01:32:13,700 --> 01:32:15,700
They help them.

1040
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,000
But someone should be told.
The authorities.

1041
01:32:21,800 --> 01:32:24,200
If you only knew of all
we've accomplished.

1042
01:32:24,900 --> 01:32:28,000
Things are settled differently
around here. Don't worry.

1043
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:31,800
Can I ask you a moral question?

1044
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:38,900
Well, I don't know a lot about
moral theology, but...

1045
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:41,000
Ask away.

1046
01:32:45,100 --> 01:32:46,700
What do you think about abortion?

1047
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:52,500
We don't have that problem
around here.

1048
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,500
But in your parish you do, huh?

1049
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:06,800
I don't know. In some cases,
one would have to consider it.

1050
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:10,500
Yes.

1051
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:25,700
And how is the bishop?

1052
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:33,100
Look, he sent you a fax.

1053
01:33:35,900 --> 01:33:38,700
It's a suspension <i>ad divinis</i>
against you.

1054
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:43,300
And excommunication too.

1055
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:56,400
You are out of the church now, Natalio.

1056
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:02,300
You can't officiate,
or give the sacraments anymore.

1057
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:06,700
You have to go before the bishop.

1058
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,400
No...

1059
01:34:10,300 --> 01:34:12,600
...l'm not going before anyone.

1060
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:18,900
Out of the church.

1061
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:24,300
If they want to kick me out,
I'm already here.

1062
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:27,000
I'll stay on as just another peasant.

1063
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:29,700
I chose this path.

1064
01:34:30,900 --> 01:34:32,000
And you?

1065
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Believe me, I admire you, Natalio.

1066
01:34:51,000 --> 01:34:52,700
Well, I have to go.

1067
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:38,700
Holy Virgin among virgins...

1068
01:35:41,100 --> 01:35:45,600
...don't let me fall,
or lose my way in adversity.

1069
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,800
I have been your faithful son...

1070
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:54,500
...since I was a child.

1071
01:35:56,800 --> 01:35:59,700
You have protected me along
the path of duty.

1072
01:36:01,100 --> 01:36:03,500
Do not forsake me in this crucial hour.

1073
01:36:03,600 --> 01:36:06,700
My Mother, grant me a miracle, please.

1074
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,100
Save me, Holy Mother.

1075
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:15,200
My mother called from Mexico City.

1076
01:36:15,300 --> 01:36:18,200
- What happened?
- They've operated on Father Benito.

1077
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:20,900
They'll be back in two weeks.

1078
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:22,800
That's good.

1079
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:33,900
What you told me over the phone,
I thought about it.

1080
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:38,100
No.

1081
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:41,200
No. Think about it more.

1082
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:44,800
You have to do it of your own free will.

1083
01:36:52,300 --> 01:36:54,600
Heaven purify my soul.

1084
01:36:54,600 --> 01:36:59,000
My spirit is filled with emotion when
I contemplate the blessings of my Lord.

1085
01:36:59,300 --> 01:37:01,300
You have shed your light
on your servant...

1086
01:37:01,300 --> 01:37:04,200
Grant me a miracle, Holy Mother.

1087
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,600
Save me.

1088
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,500
Friday at 2 in the morning.

1089
01:37:17,700 --> 01:37:20,300
Bring double the amount
that you gave me.

1090
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:47,000
Right on time, Father.

1091
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:49,000
As you should be.

1092
01:37:51,200 --> 01:37:53,000
And the girl?

1093
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:56,600
Don't tell me she chickened out?

1094
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:01,400
Too bad, Father.

1095
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,800
Straight ahead, straight ahead.

1096
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,400
Take the next turnoff to the left.

1097
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:39,900
It's all very clean.

1098
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:41,900
It's a hospital.

1099
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,400
- Wait. I want to talk to the doctor.
- You can't go in.

1100
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:48,700
I'll take care of it.

1101
01:39:48,800 --> 01:39:50,800
- I have to see the place.
- No.

1102
01:39:50,900 --> 01:39:52,400
The money.

1103
01:39:55,700 --> 01:39:58,000
Come, come, Amelita.

1104
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:00,900
Everything will be fine.

1105
01:40:02,900 --> 01:40:04,500
Ask God to watch over you.

1106
01:40:12,500 --> 01:40:14,200
Pray for me, okay?

1107
01:40:16,900 --> 01:40:19,200
Come, Amelia, come.

1108
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:20,900
Come, child.

1109
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:28,600
I'll be here, I'll be here.

1110
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,100
Good evening, young man.

1111
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:09,100
- Good evening.
- Don't you remember me?

1112
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:13,000
- No.
- We met on a bus.

1113
01:41:14,200 --> 01:41:17,000
When we were held up, remember?

1114
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,200
Oh, yes.

1115
01:41:19,500 --> 01:41:23,400
I always remember
how good you were.

1116
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:26,900
There aren't people like that,
anywhere.

1117
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:30,800
I couldn't open the store
with my grandson, like I told you.

1118
01:41:30,700 --> 01:41:33,800
I wandered around and around.

1119
01:41:33,900 --> 01:41:38,500
Until I got a job here as a night
watchman and handyman.

1120
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:42,100
- Here at the hospital?
- That's what they call it.

1121
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,800
You came for them
to relieve your girlfriend?

1122
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:52,000
I came for them to relieve me.

1123
01:41:52,100 --> 01:41:54,600
Don't worry. They all come out okay.

1124
01:41:54,600 --> 01:41:56,400
Screwed, but content.

1125
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,000
God willing.

1126
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:03,200
A hemorrhage! It won't stop!

1127
01:42:03,300 --> 01:42:04,700
What?

1128
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,000
We're treating her, get out!
You can't take her!

1129
01:42:12,900 --> 01:42:15,100
- Out of my way!
- She'll bleed to death!

1130
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,200
Wait!

1131
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,600
She's bleeding to death.

1132
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,500
Go straight.

1133
01:42:21,700 --> 01:42:23,100
- In Santa Marta...
- Open it.

1134
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:27,000
...there is a good hospital.
- Yes, I know, doctor.

1135
01:42:35,100 --> 01:42:38,800
I have to go. I have to go!

1136
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,700
Take me, take me!

1137
01:42:45,300 --> 01:42:48,100
Take me!

1138
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:51,300
Christ, sanctify me!
Body of Christ, save me!

1139
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,400
Passion of Christ, comfort me!
Blood of Christ, intoxicate me!

1140
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:56,600
Good Jesus, hear me!

1141
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:07,200
I don't want to die.

1142
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:11,900
You won't die. You won't die.

1143
01:43:18,000 --> 01:43:24,500
<i>Thy two breasts are like two young roes</i>
<i>That are twins...</i>

1144
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:35,400
Wait, Amelita, wait for me.

1145
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:46,800
Wait, Amelita.

1146
01:44:02,200 --> 01:44:03,400
Amelita?

1147
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:04,900
Poor little girl. Imagine that.

1148
01:45:04,900 --> 01:45:05,900
What happened?

1149
01:45:06,500 --> 01:45:10,100
Well, it turns out that Ruben...

1150
01:45:10,100 --> 01:45:12,900
...Don Paco's son, got her pregnant.
Imagine that.

1151
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:14,900
What a bastard.

1152
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:20,500
Well, the poor thing was desperate.

1153
01:45:20,500 --> 01:45:23,900
She went to one of those horrid clinics
to get rid of the baby.

1154
01:45:25,500 --> 01:45:28,300
Father Amaro, who is a saint...

1155
01:45:28,300 --> 01:45:31,100
...I don't know how he did it,
went to save her.

1156
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:32,400
Did he save her?

1157
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:37,700
He got her out of there and took her
to a hospital in Santa Marta.

1158
01:45:38,100 --> 01:45:41,900
But the poor thing had already
bled to death.

1159
01:45:42,100 --> 01:45:43,300
And she died?

1160
01:45:43,600 --> 01:45:46,600
Yes, she died.

1161
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:49,000
How awful.

1162
01:45:49,700 --> 01:45:55,800
Gordo, you have to close those
clinics down. Today, okay?

1163
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:04,000
The holy sacrifice of mass
which we celebrate today...

1164
01:47:03,900 --> 01:47:07,800
...we offer for the soul
of our dear sister Amelia.

1165
01:47:07,800 --> 01:47:11,200
Lord grant her eternal rest...

1166
01:47:11,400 --> 01:47:14,800
...and may His perpetual light
shine upon her.

1167
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:17,400
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

1168
01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:18,900
Amen.

1169
01:47:19,100 --> 01:47:22,100
- The Lord be with you.
- And with your spirit.

1170
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:25,400
The grace of our Lord Jesus...

1171
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,400
...the love of the Father...

1172
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,400
...and the communion of the Holy Ghost
be with you all.

1173
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:32,500
And with your spirit.

1174
01:47:33,900 --> 01:47:36,800
- I confess...
- I confess...

1175
01:47:36,900 --> 01:47:41,900
...before God almighty and before you,
brothers...

1176
01:47:41,800 --> 01:47:43,900
...that I have sinned greatly...

1177
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:48,500
...in thought, word, deed
and by omission.

1178
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:53,400
For my faults, my faults,
my great faults.

1179
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:56,900
For these I pray to Holy Mary,
always Virgin...

1180
01:47:57,000 --> 01:48:00,100
...and the angels and the saints...

1181
01:48:00,700 --> 01:48:03,200
...and all of you, my brothers...

1182
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:07,000
...who intercede for me
before God our Lord.
