1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,645
Um, subject King,
just out of County,

2
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,647
participation mandatory,

3
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,067
and details to follow.

4
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,028
All right, turn it off.

5
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,866
<i>I'm not saying shit</i>

6
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:34,284
<i>till you turn</i>
<i>the damn thing on.</i>

7
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,041
So, um, what's your name?

8
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,292
King.

9
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,256
<i> King.
</i> <i>How did you</i> <i>get that name?</i>

10
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,924
It's always been.

11
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,344
Is that your real name
or your street name? Or...

12
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:54,596
Just my name.

13
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>So how is...</i>

14
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:56,848
<i>Can I have a smoke?</i>

15
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,058
<i>Sure.</i>

16
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,730
Thanks.

17
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,274
So, how was jail?

18
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:07,692
Oh, fuck.

19
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,444
Can I... can I...
Can I say "fuck"?

20
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:10,653
Yeah.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,699
<i>It says here, "assault,</i>
<i>possession, loitering..."</i>

22
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,201
<i>and that was</i>
<i>pretty petty stuff.</i>

23
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,702
Yeah, right.

24
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,039
It's just survival.

25
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:26,377
A lot of kids tell you
that they party all night
with, uh, Axl Rose,

26
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,505
<i>or that their girlfriend</i>
<i>got banged by the crips.</i>

27
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>Or they've seen five guys</i>
<i>get murdered, or something.</i>

28
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,676
But the truth is,
it's not hard.

29
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,013
It's not easy.

30
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,265
It just is.

31
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>You okay?</i>

32
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:43,978
<i>Yeah.</i>

33
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,772
<i>How long have you</i>
<i>been on the street?</i>

34
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,398
Six, seven years.

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,944
How old are you?

36
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:55,198
Uh, 20, might be 21.
I'm not exactly sure.

37
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:57,492
That's a good question,
though.

38
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,328
<i>Did you have any</i>
<i>brothers or sisters</i>
<i>growing up?</i>

39
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:01,830
<i>Yeah, I got a sister,</i>

40
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,624
<i>but, uh, she's gone</i>
<i>from home, too.</i>

41
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:08,294
Maybe she'll show up here
in Hollywood sometime,
you know.

42
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,797
I'll take care of her,
or something.

43
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,175
I hope she's not
into drugs or anything.

44
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:15,677
She probably is.

45
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,345
She might be dead.

46
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,972
<i>What about your mom,</i>
<i>your dad?</i>

47
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,056
<i>What about 'em?</i>

48
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Do you, um...</i>

49
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,601
<i>Not very comfortable</i>
<i>talking about 'em? Yeah.</i>

50
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,436
Hey, what the hell?

51
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,897
Hey, you with the camera,
up here, I'm talking.

52
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,232
Drugs?

53
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,984
What kind you got?

54
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,944
Just kidding.

55
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,445
<i>What kind you do?</i>

56
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,655
<i>Don't do 'em.</i>

57
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,740

59
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,703

60
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:43,288
I'm being
straight with you.

61
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:46,040
You do realize
that your participation
in this program

62
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,667
is one of the terms
of your parole?

63
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,751
Yeah, I also realize

64
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,920
that you're giving me
ten bucks a pop
for these sessions,

65
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,714
so, uh,
thank you very much.

66

67
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:55,967

68
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,760

70

Is that it? Can I go?

71
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,978
Just a minute.
Um, wh... where are
you gonna go?

72
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,355
Well, I've been in lockup

00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,065
where the fuck
do you think I'm gonna go?

74
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:12,901

<i>What's a typical King day?</i>

156
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,094
<i>A typical King day?</i>

157
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:33,346
<i> Mmm.</i>

158
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,184
<i>Well, hit the streets,</i>
<i>hook up with my friends.</i>

159
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,353
<i>You know.</i>

160
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,897
<i>Kick back. Hang out.</i>

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,316
<i>Stay out of trouble.</i>

162
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,161
That's it. That's it.
That's it.

163
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:04,585
Hey, let him go,
you fucking pigs.

164
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,670
Little J.!

165
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:07,922
Now! I'm not
fucking around, man! Now!

166
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,006
Put that thing down!

167
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,591
You fucking heard me, man!
Now!

168
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,717
You heard me!

169
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:14,637
Come on, come on!
Come on! Let's go.

170
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,557
<i>They're good people.</i>

171
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,725
You'd like Little J.

172
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:22,562
He's a little shit, man,
I'm telling you.

173
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,273
- Skinny little fuck.
- Yeah.

174
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:27,733
He's growing, though.
It's wild.

175
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,028
He's hard to keep fed.

176
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,531
That's a tough habit.

177
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,449
Hey, yo, wait up.

178
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,076
When did you
get out, man?

179
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,828
Just a couple of
short hours ago.

180
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,622
You on the streets,
or are you at home?

181
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:42,707
Fuck them, man.

182
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,917
I haven't been home
since you got busted.

183
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,128
What the fuck were
you doing back there,
Little J.?

184
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,171
What do you mean?
I was saving
your fucking ass.

185
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:50,798
Don't pull a gun
on somebody again.

186
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:51,924
Get the fuck off me.

187
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,050
It was stupid.

188
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,218
It wasn't even loaded.

189
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,137
That's even stupider.

190
00:09:59,724 --> 00:10:00,725
Give it to me.

191
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:01,851
No.

192
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,060
Yes.

193
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:08,024
Where did you find
this sissy piece of shit,
anyway?

194
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:09,775
In the trash, man.
It don't even work.

195
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,235
Ah, it figures.

196
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,738
What the fuck
did you do that for, man?

197
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,822
Your own good.

198
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,157
Fuck you!

199
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,409
I'm out of here.

200
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,329
I think you
pissed him off, man.

201
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:23,122
Hey, Little J.!

202
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,915
What?

203
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,709
You want that tat still?

204
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,835
What do you think, man?

205
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,920
I've been waiting
two months
for the fucking thing.

206
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,505
Come on, then.

207
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:33,799
So, how was jail, man?

208
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,343
Boring. Easy.

209
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,969
Did you
suck any cocks?

210
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,262
Just your dad's.

211
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,097
Whoo!

212
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,184
And they're going
into the stretch!

213
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,604
Manny goes for the whip,
makes a bid for the outside!

214
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:47,688
Whoo!

215
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,191
Go ahead.

216
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,489
Run, motherfucker!
Come on!

217
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,116
<i>How do you</i>
<i>get by on the street?</i>

218
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,620
<i> Excuse me,</i>
<i>I thought we just</i>
<i>went all over that stuff</i>

219
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,956
<i>with the assault,</i>
<i>and the possession,</i>
<i>and the loitering,</i>

220
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,208
<i>all that petty stuff.</i>

221
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,417
<i>Right.</i>

222
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,461
Give it up, motherfucker!

223
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:15,966
You guys have turkey potpie?
This is, uh, vegetable beef,

224
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,011
and I... I'm allergic
to anything
with lard in it. Or, um...

225
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,931
Do they cook the turkey
with lard?

226
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,183
Coming through!

227
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
Watch out! Watch out!

228
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,521
Well, excuse me, sir.

229
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,032
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on! Come on! Whoo!

230
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,576
Going into the stretch! Whoo!

231
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,956
I did bust your ass, boy.

232
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,291
I told you. You can't fuck
with me in this wheelchair.

233
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,669
See, man, that's
one of the advantages
to being a cripple.

234
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:57,133
Oh, get the fuck
out of here.

235
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,344
Hey, fuckin'...

236
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,847
You've been in County
too long, King.

237
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,515
How you doing?

238
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,599
What's up, baby?

239
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,810
Hey, you're looking good.
Staying out of trouble, man?

240
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:08,894
Oh, I'm trying.
I'm trying.

241
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:09,979
All right.

242
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:11,730
Let's get off
this street corner.

243
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,107
Hey, you got a smoke?

244
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,942
Yeah, you need one.

245
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,944
Yo, so how was it
up County, man?

246
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:18,779
What, did you read
a couple of books?

247
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,322
-Yeah.
-Well, did you
lift some weights?

248
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:21,449
Yeah, a little bit.

249
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,617
-You suck some dicks?
-Now, come on.

250
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,788
It's great having you back,
though, man.

251
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,873
You're looking good.

252
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,374
You still
a ugly motherfucker, though.

253
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,543
<i>Drugs is the toughest habit.</i>

254
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,379
<i>And friends. Friends</i>
<i>are tough to keep, too.</i>

255
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:40,593
I don't know,
what do you think?

256
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,428
Do you want to
tell me something?

257
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,014
You want to tell me
some kind of little...

258
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,682
Little something
about your day?

259
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,142
A little... a little tidbit?

260
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:51,061
A little tidbit about you?
About your day.

261
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,857
Well, I'm just...

262
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,819
Looking... looking to
get out of here and hook up.

263
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,113
Ow, man.

264
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,657
-You all right?
-Yeah.

265
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,825
Don't be a puss.

266
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:05,910
Fuck you.

267
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,662
Yo, King, man,
you gonna crash with us
in the hole tonight?

268
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,748
I mean, we saved
your clothes and shit.

269
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,043
No, I was gonna look
for Devon, maybe get some.

270
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,669
Has anybody seen her?

271
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,879
No, man, I ain't seen her.

272
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,005
What do you mean?

273
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,507
I mean, I ain't
seen her, man.

274
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,926
What the fuck, you guys?
Goddamn!

275
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,595
I told you to
watch out for my lady,

276
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,721
And... and so, what?

277
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,139
Is that... is that
too much to ask or what?

278
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:30,184
Hey, look, King, man,
um, last time we seen her,

279
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,852
she was with that kid,
Tommy Ray.

280
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,646
I think she's
in his stable.

281
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,065
You've seen Devon
with Tommy Ray?

282
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,400
Yeah, she started
swinging with him
when you got locked up.

283
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,237
Well, just out of curiosity,
were you gonna tell me?

284
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,363
Yeah.

285
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,447
Yeah? When?

286
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:44,615
I don't know.

287
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,950
Thank God you're back.

288
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,868
Hey, Brenda.
Who are you?

289
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,286
Heather.

290
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,663
You just get here?

291
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,540
Two days ago.
She's from chicago.

292
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,916
Trip out. Me, too.

293
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,751
Bullshit, you're from Phoenix.

294
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,711
Brenda, you know,
the next time I want you

295
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,047
to open your mouth,
I'll... I'll point at you.

296
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,091
Why don't you sit down?

297
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,634
You're making me nervous.

298
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,680
I'm King.

299
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,266
King?
As in what, burger?

300
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,393
He's the one
I told you about.

301
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,477
Yeah, I bet you did.

302
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,104
Hey, y'all,
I was thinking of

303
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,273
maybe going and doing
a little train hopping.

304
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,399
Yeah.

305
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,525
How'd that be?

306
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,609
Cool.

307
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,736
Greg there's got some speed,
don't you, Greg?

308
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,949
I was thinking maybe
we'd get, uh, some pot,
some mushrooms.

309
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,909
I don't know.
Let's get all fucked up.

310
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,077
Yeah, later.

311
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,454
Hey, Crasher, come here.
Come here, man.

312
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,376
<i>So why do you think</i>
<i>so many kids come out here?</i>

313
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,003
<i>Most kids come out to L.A.</i>

314
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,629
<i>looking for Hollywood.</i>

315
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,798
Told you everything
would be cool, didn't I?

316
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,425
<i>Usually, it's not</i>
<i>what they expect.</i>

317
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,010
-You're from Chicago?
-Yeah.

318
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,804
Crasher, I went in lockup
for two months.

319
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,973
I get out, and everything
turns to shit.

320
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,893
I took a zip gun off
of Little J. tonight.

321
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,521
Greg is off
tweaking his brains out.

322
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,106
And where the hell
is my girlfriend?

323
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,191
I don't know.

324
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,068
-Huh?
-I don't know.

325
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,656
Well, what the fuck
do you know about?

326
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,619
Don't look at me
like it's my fault.

327
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,079
Crasher, man,
you fucked me.

328
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,709
I asked you to
look out for everyone.

329
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,045
Yeah, well,
you shouldn't have done that.

330
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,005
That was a mistake.

331
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:27,384
I mean, shit, man,
nobody listens to me.

332
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,595
You know, you're the one
they listen to.

333
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,097
Shit, I'm older than you
and I don't get
any kind of respect.

334
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:35,517
Before you start pointing
fingers, you take a look
in that fucking mirror.

335
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,353
That's the guy
you want to blame.

336
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:39,688
You know, it's pretty lame
how you got busted that way.

337
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,566
You know,
and then you just,
like, disappear,

338
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,902
and figure, well,
I just gonna, like,
keep tabs on everybody.

339
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,487
Well, guess again, pal.

340
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,821
On Devon?

341
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,866
Yeah.

342
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:55,829
I'm sorry, man,

343
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,582
but it's not my fault.

344
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,795
I didn't have anyone else
I could ask.

345
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,132
What are you doing?

346
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,384
You stink.

347
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,510
That's you, man.

348
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,261
-It's not me.
-It's you.

349
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:12,429
It's not me.

350
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,603
Someone could be dying
in the fucking streets

351
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,688
and they won't
do a thing.

352
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,481
But if you just
so happen to jaywalk,

353
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:24,316
ten of them will come
out of the woodwork.

354
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,777
Shit, I got busted
last week for jaywalking.

355
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,530
You got busted
for being too fat.

356
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,365
Shut up, dickhead!

357
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:32,700
King...

358
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,953
King, uh, the trolls
are partying tonight
at the western squat.

359
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,538
King?

360
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,290
Why doesn't anybody
fucking listen
to me around here?

361
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,709
Hey, mouse.
How old are you?

362
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,377
Almost 18.

363
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,671
How come you
moved to hollyweird?

364
00:16:46,588 --> 00:16:47,673
Just wanted to.

365
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:49,425
You want to be
a movie star, don't you?

366
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,551
No.

367
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,219
-Yeah, you do.
-No, I don't.

368
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,346
Why not?
I'm gonna be one.

369
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,016
Yeah, after you lose
about 100 pounds.

370
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,727
Brenda, I think you
have star quality.

371
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,312
Yeah, Julia Roberts,
eat your heart out, baby.

372
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,939
Yeah, sleeping
with a fat girl.

373
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,024
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you.

374
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,191
Hey, J., come on.

375
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,943
Why don't you
sit the fuck down.

376
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,111
Don't touch me.

377
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:15,075
Hey, I heard you had to
sleep with somebody
to get in this joint.

378
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,660
No, I didn't.

379
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:18,871
Crasher.

380
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,456
Have you seen Devon?
Is she here?

381
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:23,125
No, I ain't seen her,
But Tommy Ray is over there.

382
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,251
Is that right?

383
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,377
Yeah.

384
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,547
Tommy.

385
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,216
Holy shit!

386
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,969
Well, well, well.

387
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,554
It's the King

388
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,806
And his little
band of butt pirates.

389
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,099
Hey, fuck you, man.

390
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,602
Fuck me?
That's what I got in mind.

391
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,854
Who is this guy
right here?

392
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,981
Hey, you know, for a kid,
you got a great ass.

393
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,399
I could make money
With this kid.

394
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,901
I'm looking for Devon.

395
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,570
Yeah?
Well, who isn't?

396
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,074
Well, I ain't
seen the little cunt.

397
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,285
That's not quite
how I heard it, Tommy.

398
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,411
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

399
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:01,080
Well, don't believe
everything you hear.

400
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,790
That fucking bitch
was stealing from me.

401
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,459
She stole my radio,
she stole my rock.

402
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,420
So naturally I kicked
the fucking bitch out.

403
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,005
I mean, the last
I heard was

404
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,841
that, uh, she got
her face cut up real bad,
and just...

405
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,177
No, no, no. I know her.
She's not robbing

406
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,012
or stealing or thieving.
Nothing.

407
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,056
So what are you doing?
You calling me a liar?

408
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,182
Hey, Tommy Ray,

409
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,184
you got your whole life
to be an asshole.

410
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,936
Why don't you
take tonight off?

411
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,063
Why don't you
go fuck yourself, huh?

412
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:31,193
All right, all right,
Get the fuck off of him.
Get off of him.

413
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,987
Be cool. Be cool.

414
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,282
Come on,
where is she?

415
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,951
Hey, why don't you
do me a favor?

416
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,828
Why don't you
bring back your little friend

417
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,704
as soon as he, uh,
gets some pubic hair.

418
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,206
Hey, fuck you, man!

419
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,458
Pubic hair,
that... that's good.

420
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,757
Come on, Greg,
don't be needing that.

421
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,008
Fuck that.

422
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,802
And fuck Tommy Ray!

423
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,887
You shouldn't have
tossed my fucking gun.

424
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm glad I did, too.
I feel like killing somebody.

425
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,977
<i>Did your family</i>
<i>live in the hole</i>

426
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,229
<i>which is under</i>
<i>the bridge of the...</i>

427
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,647
<i>Under the freeway, yeah.</i>

428
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,190
<i>But not always there.</i>

429
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,650
<i>It depends on the weather</i>

430
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,902
<i>and, you know,</i>
<i>who's with us</i>
<i>or who's already there,</i>

431
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,196
<i>but that's basically our home.</i>

432
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,198
I'll sleep with you, King.

433
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,742
Oh, Brenda, now that's...
Now, that's sweet.

434
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,078
I'm just not sure
I'm up to the challenge.

435
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,246
Why not, baby?

436
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,331
Because you're too fat
is why not, bitch!

437
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,416
Shut up, fool!

438
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,917
Fuck you, bitch.
I ain't no fool.

439
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,086
Yeah, you are.
You're a scrawny
little piece of shit.

440
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,421
Fuck, he's been here forever.

441
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,464
- Seven years.
-  -I'm sick of you and your trash.

442
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,092
If I want to
sleep with King,
I'll sleep with King.

443
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,553
Keep your butt
out of it.

444
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,471
Just shut the fuck up!
- No!

445
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:42,848
Hey, J. Stay out
of her hair,

446
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,933
or she's gonna
keep us up all night,
all right.

447
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,185
I know, I know,
I know.

448
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,270
Here. Here.
Hey, where are
you guys staying?

449
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,855
We've been
at the Bowl Motel.

450
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,773
- Shit, who's paying for that?
-  -I paid for it.

451
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:53,984
Well, I ain't whoring,
if that's what you're asking.

452
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,402
Yeah, sure you ain't.

453
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:58,030
Listen, you save your money,
this one here will
take you for a ride.

454
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,198
I'm gonna get a job.

455
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:00,782
And you know shit,
dick-for-brains.

456
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,867
I hope you do.

457
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,827
It's "You know dick,
shit-for-brains."

458
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,953
So get one.

459
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,622
I think either
is correct.

460
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,248
It's a declarative sentence,

461
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,499
so the juxtaposition
of the adjective

462
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,959
is appropriate
in either place.

463
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,545
Hey, nobody here
take any of Heather's money.

464
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,130
I'd take that personal.

465
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,841
Oh, okay, King,
I won't take it from her.

466
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,010
I don't think
that would be right.

467
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,136
Ok, I won't do it.

468
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,804
She's my buddy,
and I'm takin' care of her.

469
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,598
...right?

470
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,476
Hey, Little J.,
what's the aerosol <i>du jour?</i>

471
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,145
I don't know.
Just something
I picked up in 'Nam.

472
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:34,149
When I was down in County,
Greg came down,

473
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,362
but like he was gonna
get $500 to bail me out?

474
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,531
It's nice, though,

475
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,494
to have somebody
that, uh, wanted to.

476
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,622
Hey!

477
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,958
Hey, what's up?

478
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,751
You want some?

479
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,838
You should try
and get some sleep.

480
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:58,090
No.

481
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,301
You gonna sleep
With Heather tonight?

482
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,679
Not tonight.

483
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,599
When I went in lockup,

484
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,226
I couldn't sleep
for the first week.

485
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:11,937
I was used to
the fucking freeway.

486
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,483
Have to get
used to it again.

487
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,197
You having fun?

488
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,200
Yeah, I'm good.

489
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,578
I'm totally fucking tweaked.

490
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,877
Can I scratch that
for you?

491
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,047
Can we do something
tomorrow night?

492
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,215
Yeah.

493
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,300
Can we?

494
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:42,926
Yeah.

495
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,805
I'd like that.

496
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,435
All right,
I'm out of here, man.

497
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,187
Uh, King.

498
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,399
It's good to
have you back, man.

499
00:21:57,983 --> 00:21:58,984
Thanks.

500
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,820
It makes me feel better,
you know?

501
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,171
Can I have one?

502
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,422
Morning.

503
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,757
Hi.

504
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,508
That's the best I can do.

505
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:25,010
That's good.

506
00:22:27,345 --> 00:22:29,347
Where did you
learn that?

507
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,561
I don't know. I've just
been doing it forever.

508
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,772
How long you been
picking at your nails?

509
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,356
<i>People can come</i>
<i>into your life,</i>

510
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,358
and you can
become very close,

511
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,777
and then
they're gone in a week,

512
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,862
and you never see them again.

513
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:46,865
Hmm, how do you
feel about that?

514
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,618
There's nothing
I can do about it.

515
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,955
What were you
locked up for?

516
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,958
Assault
with a deadly weapon.

517
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,835
This bum was
trying to rob me,

518
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,962
so I hit him
with a bottle.

519
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,257
He got three stitches,
and I got three months.

520
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,759
One month suspended.

521
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,302
Brenda said you killed him.

522
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:10,639
Yeah, well, Brenda,
she says a lot of things.

523
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:14,059
I'd believe
about none of them.

524
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,648
Could I ask you a favor?

525
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,900
What kind of favor?

526
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,568
Oh, just a simple favor.

527
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,488
Maybe.

528
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,657

537
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,016
-Got a cigarette?
-Sure.

538
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,685
I thought I was
gonna go fucking nuts.

539

-Yeah.

Can you
fix this fucker?

554

555
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,155
It's a piece of shit!

556
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,491
I don't know, man.
I could try.

557
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,911
Well, if you can fix it,
you got a quarter of meth, man.

558
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:57,078
Move over.

559
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,914
Shit, I'd do it for that.

560
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,415
Put on a goddamn shirt.

561
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,917
Oh, why don't you?

562

bought this yesterday.

In this refrigerator
except us.

566
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,011

My treat.

572
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,370
No, fuck that, man.
No needles.

573
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,040
Good boy. Just say no.

574
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,377
I say yeah.

575
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,298
When's the last time
you ate?

576
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:51,800
Yesterday.

577
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,136
Fuck. I can't get
this stupid fucking thing.

578
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,806
J., no, give it up, man.
You're never gonna get it.

579
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,974
Yeah.

580
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,141
You want
another burger?

581
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,268
Yeah.

582
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,811
I'll take one, too, buddy.

583
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,729
Fuck you, Little Buddy.

584
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:07,732
So, you want to spend
the night with me, baby?

585
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:08,984
He likes you.

586
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,610
Oh, yeah?

587
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,112
Definitely.

588
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:13,655
How can you tell?

589
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,700
I can tell
by the way he's acting.
He's trying to be all cool.

590
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,951
I think she's right.

591
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,744
Besides, you're
a dead ringer for Devon.

592
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,329
Who's that?

593
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,081
His ex-old lady.

594
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:24,499
He killed her.

595
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:25,709
Really?

596
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,003
Yeah, just fucking stabbed
her right in the gut

597
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,879
and cut her up
in little pieces.

598
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,506
But don't tell him
I told you that.

599
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,216
It could... it could
get a little messy.

600
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,384
I won't.

601
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,052
He's very touchy about it.

602
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:38,430
You know, who knows
when he might strike again.
He's lethal.

603
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:39,764
Here you go.

604
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,890

605
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,102

689
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:42,984

-Why?
-Why not?

691
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,489
You're a little edgy,
aren't you?

692
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,742
Well, maybe I am.

693
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:54,245
I mean, what's this I hear

straight between us.

699

00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,282

mean to scare you.

704

I'm kind of tired myself,
I guess.

706
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,052
Here,
take my sleeping bag.

707
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,303
Make yourself comfortable.

708
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,429
It's okay.

709
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:54,889
No, it's okay.
I got an extra one.

710
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,057

-Yeah.

712

Thanks.

713

00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,122
<i>What's one of my lines?</i>

791
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,166
<i> Yeah,</i>
<i>what's one of your lines?</i>

792
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,004
<i>Buddy,</i>
<i>can you spare a dime?</i>

793
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,925
<i>That one</i>
<i>doesn't usually work.</i>

794
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,053
But, no, you can say
pretty much anything.

795
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,805
People, you know, they can
tell when you need money.

796
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,058
And when I get money,
I give it to somebody

797
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,893
that's less fortunate than me.

798
00:37:08,976 --> 00:37:10,561
So, I figure, it goes around.

799
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,784
Is Ted here?

800
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,410
- Ted!
- Who is it?

801
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,912
Greg.

802
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,051
Aspirin?

803
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:43,678
No, man.
I'm trying to quit.

804
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,981
So, what do you need, huh?
More meth?

805
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,607
Yeah, man.

806
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,612
That shit will drive
you crazy after a while.

807
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:11,038
Sure you don't want
to slam one of these?

808
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:12,331
No, man.

809
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,668
Suit yourself.

810
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,967
Just say no.

811
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,746
Here you go, man.

812
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,914
Hey.

813
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,500
Where's the cash
you owe me, huh?

814
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:58,794
Man, I'll... I'll get it.

815
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:00,755
Come back when you do.

816
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,423
Well, I was thinking
you could front me a bit.

817
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,091
Oh, no can do, bro.

818
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,260
Can't do that no more.
Times are changing.

819
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,013
Well, maybe I could make
a run for you again.
Like I did that one time.

820
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:12,183
Just get the cash you owe me
and take a shower.
You really stink.

821
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:15,061
Now, out of here.
Come on.

822
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,194
You do spare-changing,
and stuff like that,

823
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:24,737
but you don't
walk the streets.

824
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,906
What does
"walk the streets" mean?

825
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:30,034
It means I never had to
fuck anybody for money.

826
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:33,412
<i>But you've seen</i>
<i>lots of kids do it.</i>

827
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,916
<i> Yeah. </i>
<i>You see lots of kids do it.</i>

828
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,710
<i>Boys and girls. You know,</i>
<i>when they're growing up,</i>

829
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:42,129
<i>they never think that</i>
<i>that's how</i>
<i>it's gonna turn out</i>

830
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,883
<i>and they wake up one morning,</i>
<i>and then, there they are,</i>
<i>doing it, you know.</i>

831
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,803
- Hey, Kimmy.
- Hey, Little J.

832
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:49,970
Where you staying?

833
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,138
The Hills Motel.

834
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,223
How many people you got?

835
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,557
-Five.
-Who?

836
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,518
Some of Rob's
asshole friends.

837
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:56,894
How much you paying?

838
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,896
Seven bucks. Unless a trick
buys it for us.

839
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,314
-Can I use your shower?
-Yeah.

840
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,400
-Hello? Hi, is Dave there?
-Can I use your shower?

841
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:04,735
Yeah. Go ahead.
Go for it. Go.

842
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,070
All right.
Thank you.

843
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,323
Hi, yeah, Dave.
Hi, it's Kimmy.

844
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,076
Do, uh, you want to
have a date tonight?

845
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:14,495
It's that first time

846
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,748
that gets 'em.
I've seen 'em.

847
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:19,792
I've just never
had a first time.

848
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:22,253
Where are all
the hookers at?

849
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,255
Well, most of
the scuzzy ones

850
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:26,465
work downtown
or in the valley.

851
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,884
But a lot of them
go through those
escort services.

852
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,094
Excuse me, sir,

853
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,805
Me and my sister
haven't had something to eat
for a couple of days.

854
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,598
Could you help us out?

855
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,601
Thanks.

856
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,603
-King?
-Hmm?

857
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:42,148
-Have you ever...
-No. No.

858
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,900
Not unless you count
sleeping with some girl

859
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:47,695
just to have a place
to lay your head down,

860
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:49,363
shut your eyes.

861
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,115
Know what I mean?

862
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:52,783
No.

863
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,410
Good.

864
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:57,997
Oh, my goodness,
What's that?

865
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:07,381
So what happens
when the cops bust a squat?

866
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:09,967
Uh, well...

867
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,930
Usually they're pretty cool,
but I have to get
the kids out of there

868
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,267
'cause they'll run them
through missing person
rr runaway, you know.

869
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,853
They'll just
send them on home.

870
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,981
<i>I wouldn't let any</i>
<i>of my friends go home.</i>

871
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,524
<i>It's worse there.</i>

872
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,609
<i>I swear.</i>

873
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,403
And the hardwood floors
were redone about a year ago.

874
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,616
Kellin, can I call you back?
Someone's at my back door.

875
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,326
Okay, thanks, bye-bye.

876
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,746
Well, look who
we have here.

877
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,789
You've been gone, what,
two months this time?

878
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,209
Greg, can I ask you
how long you plan
on staying?

879
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,668
Greg, talk to me!

880
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,045
-Shut up!
-Greg!

881
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:47,880
I'm calling your father!

882
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,006
Fuck you!

883
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:53,219
<i>I mean, I wouldn't let</i>
<i>any of my friends go home.</i>

884
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,804
Hey, thanks
for the shower, man.

885
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,473
You look like
a drowned fucking rat.

886
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,600
-Hey, Rob, how old are you?
-What's it to you?

887
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,477
I don't know.
Just asking.

888
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:05,105
I'm 22, but I could
Pass for 17. Why?

889
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:09,193
I need to buy some bullets,
But they won't
sell them to me.

890
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,153
What do you
need them for?

891
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:16,867
Ah.

892
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:18,827
Let me see that.

893
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,788
See with your eyes,
not with your hands.

894
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,248
You're an asshole.

895
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,501
Will you buy 'em?
I mean, I got the money.

896
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:28,754
Well, maybe,
if you do something for me.

897
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,589
Like what?

898
00:42:30,673 --> 00:42:33,551
I got this trick later,
but I don't want to see him.
I'm busy.

899
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:35,177
Maybe you can go
in my place.

900
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,680
No way, man,
I'm not down for that shit.

901
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,890
He's a cool old guy,
he won't even touch you.

902
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,308
You don't need to
touch him or nothing.

903
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,810
No.

904
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,272
Okay.

905
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:48,607
Sure is a sweet gun.

906
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:52,361
I mean,
what's the use of a gun
if you ain't got no bullets?

907
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,655
It's pretty fresh.

908
00:42:57,658 --> 00:42:59,577
Okay, it's your loss.
I mean,

909
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,372
it sure is a shame
you don't got any ammo
for that fresh gun.

910
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:07,376
Fucking dick.

911
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:17,970
Cheap piece of shit.

912
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,025
Greg?

913
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:32,776
Greg?

914
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,488
Greg,
can you open the door?

915
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:41,285
Greg.

916
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,537
Open the door, son.

917
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,372
What do you want, dad?

918
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,249
Your stepmom and I want to
talk to you downstairs.

919
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,752
Dad, we got
nothing to say, man.

920
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:53,172
Just open the door,
I want to speak
with you downstairs.

921
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,594
Open the door!

922
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,554
What do you
fucking want?

923
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,264
We want to talk
with you downstairs.

924
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,932
I don't see what there is
to talk about.

925
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,184
I'm 17 years old.
I can do...

926
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,268
What the fuck
is he doing here?

927
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,603
Greg, you're under arrest
for grand theft.

928
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,687
I didn't
steal a fucking thing!

929
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,688
You took the jewelry.

930
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,607
You get what you deserve, Greg!
- Fucking bitch!

931
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,733
You put him up to this!

932
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,942
You need help!

933
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,194
God damn it!

934
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,823
You're quite young,
aren't you?

935
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,787
Yeah.

936
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,165
I, uh, sell those.

937
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:30,167
if you ever need one,
just let me know.

938
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:33,170
Okay.

939
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,466
Well, uh...

940
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,678
Could I get you something?
Maybe a coke or some juice?

941
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,764
An ashtray
would be nice, thanks.

942
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:46,767
Now look, nobody
smokes in this house.

943
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,396
Sorry.

944
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,108
It's okay.

945
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:57,361
Look, I got to
get going in a while.

946
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,446
Why don't we take care
of business, all right?

947
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,614
Business?

948
00:45:00,697 --> 00:45:02,157
Yeah, you know, uh...

949
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:06,453
A jerk-off or...
whatever turns you on.

950
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:09,665
Could I ask you
a question?

951
00:45:11,125 --> 00:45:12,126
Yeah.

952
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,461
When was the first time
you had sex?

953
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:19,299
I was about, uh, about 12.

954
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,094
Who was it with?

955
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,555
This chick at school.

956
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,226
When was the first time
you had sex with a man?

957
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,526
About 10 or 11, I guess.

958
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,781
So, you had sex with a guy
before you had
sex with a girl.

959
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:45,784
Yeah.

960
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,370
Who was it with?

961
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,875
My uncle.

962
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,712
Oh.

963
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,882
Look,
I know you're paying me,
but what is this crap?

964
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,717
Did you enjoy it?

965
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,719
Do you want to talk,
or what?

966
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,557
What if I were to ask you
if I could touch your face?

967
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,269
Would that be
all right?

968
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,189
Would you mind?

969
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,696
No, whatever.

970
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:58,357
This is a good place
to know about.

971
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,567
You can come in the afternoon,
get something to eat,

972
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,278
some nights you can get a bed
if it's not too crowded.

973
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:05,030
They got
a lot of rules, though.

974
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:06,532
I think
I broke most of them.

975
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,075
You got to sign in.

976
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,869
I can't stay, I got to
go to this interview.

977
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:13,872
They got me being
this community service
guinea pig.

978
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,125
Can I be your habitrail?

979
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,755
Yeah, we'll see.

980
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,432
Hi, sorry I'm late.

981
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,101
That's okay.

982
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:35,894
So, what's the topic today?

983
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:37,771
Well, what do you
want to talk about?

984
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:39,773
What? Are you
out of questions already?

985
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:40,899
Hmm.

986
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,943
Have you seen this one?

987
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,027
Yeah, I saw that.

988
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,196
You did? How about this one?

989
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,864
Heads or tails?

990
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:51,118
Heads.

991
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,787
Cheating.

992
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,339
<i>Yeah, we got that one.</i>

993
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,924
<i>I know,</i>
<i>I'll show you my tattoos.</i>

994
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,926
Wow!

995
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:10,679
You like that?

996
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:11,638
That's great.

997
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,973
I got one
on my right arm, too.

998
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,057
Mmm.

999
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,642
I did that myself,
left-handed.

1000
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:16,768
Wow.

1001
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:19,146
My dad did this one
when I was 14.

1002
00:48:19,229 --> 00:48:20,355
Really?

1003
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,359
Do you still
keep in touch with him?

1004
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,739
What happened?

1005
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,366
I don't know. Um...

1006
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,828
I don't know, he's probably
dead or something.

1007
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,290
See, uh, tattoos
weren't his only thing.

1008
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:41,043
He had a taste
for all kinds of needles.

1009
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,345
<i>You're feeling</i>
<i>pretty good these days?</i>

1010
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,221
Yeah, I'm feeling
pretty good these days.

1011
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,140
You got
a little cough, though.

1012
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:04,775
Some days I feel good,
some days I don't,
like everybody else.

1013
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:07,778
Yeah, actually I get along
with them really well.

1014
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,905
I needed a short break
or something, I think.

1015
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,281
Okay, you ready to go?

1016
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,617
-Yeah.
-I see you met Stephanie.

1017
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,160
-Come on.
-Thanks.

1018
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:16,578
See you later.

1019
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,666
Faggot.

1020
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:25,087
Fucking fag.

1021
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,296
Fuck.

1022
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:42,479
So, what are
your drugs of choice?

1023
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,486
-Um, crystal.
-Hmm.

1024
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:50,904
Pot sometimes.

1025
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:52,948
Coke, if I can get it.

1026
00:49:53,031 --> 00:49:54,032
Mmm.

1027
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:57,244
When did you, uh,
start using?

1028
00:49:58,745 --> 00:50:00,497
When I was about 10 or 11.

1029
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,000
It says here, uh...

1030
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,378
the first time you ran away
you were nine.

1031
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,922
You ran to your mother.
Why the hell did you do that?

1032
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,425
I wanted
to live with her,

1033
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,094
but her and I
don't get along so good.

1034
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,178
Hmm.

1035
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:18,515
What about your father,
you, uh, like him?

1036
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,017
Yeah, he's all right.

1037
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,853
But he got you arrested.

1038
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,481
Yeah, well, life goes on.

1039
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:29,609
Yeah, life goes on.

1040
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:34,614
You know, I got to tell you,
you're... you're a very
lucky guy, you know that?

1041
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:39,202
See, you've been given
a second chance here.

1042
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:42,247
You could have just gone
straight to a lockup,
but you're in a rehab.

1043
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:46,376
I got to be honest with you,
uh, I'm a little hesitant
to take you in.

1044
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,128
See, you have this
habit of running away.

1045
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:50,839
I mean, what's my guarantee
that you're not
gonna run from us, huh?

1046
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:54,217
Well, I need help
with my problem.

1047
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,930
Excuse me, miss,
can you spare some change?

1048
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,849
All I want is
a little something to eat.

1049
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,017
Skank!

1050
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,351
How you doing, cripple?

1051
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,228
Tommy, get your
stinking-ass breath
out of my face.

1052
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,146
Let's take a little ride.

1053
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:07,814
Hey, Tommy,
get the fuck off me.

1054
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,274
Tommy,
Get the fuck off me!

1055
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,401
You're infringing on
my fucking Civil Rights, man.

1056
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,569
Shut the fuck up.

1057
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,446
Get off me. fucking bitch.
Get off of me, man.

1058
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,655
Calm down.

1059
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,115
Tommy, leave me
the fuck alone, man!

1060
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,700
I didn't
do shit to you, man!

1061
00:51:18,784 --> 00:51:21,828
Tommy, leave me
the fuck alone!
Get off me!

1062
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,791
Relax, asshole,
I'm just looking for King.

1063
00:51:26,458 --> 00:51:27,375
Have you seen him?

1064
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:30,712
I think I did see King,
I think he went
down to the corner.

1065
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,590
You know,
your grandma is down there
spit-shining dicks again.

1066
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:37,093
There's a deal
on balls today,
two for the price of one.

1067
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:38,845
Hey, man,
get the fuck off me!

1068
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:41,264
I asked you a question.
Didn't you hear me?

1069
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,600
Yeah, I fucking heard you.

1070
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:44,935
Yes, sir.

1071
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,190
Yes, sir, asshole.

1072
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,483
Yes, sir, asshole.

1073
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,609
No!

1074
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:57,739
Just, "Yes, sir."

1075
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:01,451
Yes, sir.

1076
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:04,538
That's better.

1077
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,752
Where do I find King?

1078
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:14,172
Down at the hole.

1079
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,465
The hole.

1080
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,430
Nice hat.

1081
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,647
You know, Tommy,
you're a punk bitch!

1082
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:32,232
Oh, yeah.

1083
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,609
Almost forgot something.

1084
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,915
Hello, family.

1085
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:50,876

Say hello to Greg.

Hello, Greg.

1091
00:53:02,804 --> 00:53:03,972
What's up?

1092
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,692
Hey, where's King?

1093
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:16,943
He's up there, man.

1094
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:26,411
King. King, get up.

1095
00:53:26,494 --> 00:53:27,454
King, get up.

1096
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,457
Help! Somebody help!

1097
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,001
Help!

1098
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,129
Leave him alone!

1099
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,260
Leave him alone!

1100
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,721
Leave him alone! Help!

1101
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:55,315
Are you okay?

1102
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:04,115
King? No!

1103
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,450
Oh, fuck.

1104
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,161

This program
where they contact

1156

kids' parents
and they arrange it

1157
00:57:14,722 --> 00:57:17,392
So that they can
go back home.

1158
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:19,811
So?

1159

go back to Chicago.

I think you should.

1161
00:57:25,692 --> 00:57:27,193
I don't want to go back.

1162
00:57:27,735 --> 00:57:29,404
Do you want me to go back?

1163
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,281
I think it might
be a good idea.

1179
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,155

Yell a little louder,

1181

tell you three times.

-Yeah, me, too.
-You go first.

1263
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:01,134
No, go ahead.

1264
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,468
- No, go.
- After you.

1265
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,262
No, go, you smell.
- No, you...

1266
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,849
Come on,
you had to have known.

1267
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,225
You stink.

1268
01:02:12,353 --> 01:02:14,021
Take off the hat.

1269
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,735
A pimp named
Tommy Ray white
was killed last night.

1270
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,028
Oh, that's terrible.

1271
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,615
No, not really,
but we do need
some information.

1272
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,493
I don't know
anything about it.

1273
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:31,372
I'm not saying you do,
but we hope your friend
King might.

1274
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,208
We just want
to talk to him.

1275
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,252
Just talk, that's all.

1276
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,798
You think you might be
able to tell him that,
next time you see him?

1277
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,092
Yeah, sure,
I can tell him that.

1278
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:46,137
I mean,
if I see him, you know.

1279
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,722
You'll see him.

1280
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:50,808
What's wrong?

1281
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:52,894
Where the fuck did
Little J. get a gun?

1282
01:02:52,977 --> 01:02:55,229
I told him not
to fuck with guns.

1283
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:58,566
Oh, man. Fuck.

1284
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:00,526
Here, let me help.

1285
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:01,736
Yeah.

1286
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:04,113
Jesus!

1287
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,074
Yeah, he got me,
the bastard.

1288
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,497
I mean, what do
you think happened?

1289
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,123
Do you think he died?

1290
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,418
Maybe.

1291
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,963
It's gonna be okay.

1292
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,007
No, it's not okay.
It's not okay.

1293
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,967
We're sitting in this motel
like nothing's wrong,

1294
01:03:25,051 --> 01:03:28,137
and Crasher's in
fucking jail for all I know.

1295
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:30,181
Where's Little J.?
It's not okay.

1296
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:31,891
I'm sorry.

1297
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,814
It's not supposed to be
like this at all.

1298
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:43,319
I'm sorry.

1299
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:44,904
I'm sorry.

1300
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:01,379
Oh, shit.

1301
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:04,632
Have a seat up here.

1302
01:04:07,593 --> 01:04:09,345
I'm sorry,
I forgot.

1303
01:04:10,596 --> 01:04:12,098
I was just, uh...

1304
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,102
What do you need?

1305
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:18,604
Nothing.

1306
01:04:26,612 --> 01:04:30,199
You know,
I do have a spare bedroom

1307
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,034
if I thought
I could trust you.

1308
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:37,707
Well, I suppose you could
stay here a few days.

1309
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,166
Would you like that?

1310
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,210
That'd be great.

What do you need?

1320
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,632
I thought maybe I could
get a little taste, man.

1321
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:11,175
You got money?

1322
01:06:11,634 --> 01:06:12,885
Not on me, man.

1323
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,471
What are you
doing here, man?

1324
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:16,681
I thought...

1325
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:17,765
No.

1327
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,154
Why don't you ever ask me
anything about myself?

1328
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:33,823
Like what?
I just met you.

1329
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:38,202
I don't know.
Like, anything.
Like why I left home,

1330
01:06:38,285 --> 01:06:40,997
what my family's like,
how I got here?

1331
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,124
I know why
you left home.

1332
01:06:43,207 --> 01:06:45,209
Think you're
pretty clever, huh?

1333
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:46,377
No.

1334
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,295
No, really?

1335
01:06:48,629 --> 01:06:51,132
I bet you've known
a lot of girls like me.

1336
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,634
No, I haven't.

1337
01:06:55,636 --> 01:06:57,805
So, tell me,
why did I leave home?

1338
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,391
Man, forget about it.

1339
01:07:00,474 --> 01:07:02,059
No, really,
I'd like to know.

1340
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,811
One or two reasons.

1341
01:07:04,895 --> 01:07:08,065
Either your father
molested you,
or your stepfather did.

1342
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,575
You're a jerk.

1343
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,827
Why else
would you be here?

1344
01:07:22,413 --> 01:07:24,582
That painting's
really spooky.

1345
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,168
Yeah, it's freaky,
it looks like the devil.

1346
01:07:28,544 --> 01:07:31,005
It looks like
the Grim Reaper.

1347
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:35,718
My father didn't fuck me,
my brother did.

1348
01:07:35,801 --> 01:07:37,470
So, a lot you know.

1349
01:07:43,893 --> 01:07:45,102
I'm sorry.

1350
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:49,273
I am.

1351
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:08,542
Open the fucking register!

1352
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,127
-Get out of here!
-Fuck you!

1353
01:08:12,004 --> 01:08:13,798
Motherfucker,
sit down, back off!

1354
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:14,840
Stay the fuck down!

1355
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:15,925
Fuck you!

1356
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,719
I call the police on you,
motherfucker!

1357
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,577
Checkout time
was half hour ago.

1358
01:08:43,661 --> 01:08:45,079
Oh, shit.

1359
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:48,457
Oh.

1360
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:50,417
I think we should
get up and go

1361
01:08:50,501 --> 01:08:52,628
and get some more money
like we did yesterday.

1362
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:53,879
It was so good
on the pier...

1363
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,297
Listen. Listen.

1364
01:08:55,548 --> 01:08:59,343
That money,
that's some of the money
I had with me from Chicago.

1365
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:02,096
Oh.

1366
01:09:02,179 --> 01:09:04,348
I didn't make anything
on the pier.

1367
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,935
Why did you lie to me?

1368
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:12,231
I don't know, maybe
I just thought I had to.

1369
01:09:17,194 --> 01:09:18,237
I can't stand it.

1370
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,197
What are you mumbling about?

1371
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:22,366
I don't want
you to be me.

1372
01:09:22,449 --> 01:09:23,826
What are you talking about?

1373
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:26,287
I don't want you
to be me, mouse.

1374
01:09:27,454 --> 01:09:30,166
I... I see people on
the street every day,
and then I just see myself

1375
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:31,333
and I don't want to see you.

1376
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:33,460
I don't want to see
that happen to you.

1377
01:09:33,627 --> 01:09:35,254
It won't happen to me.

1378
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:39,717
It won't happen
to us, I promise.

1379
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:58,736
Collect call from Greg.

1380
01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:07,203
<i>Hello?</i>

1381

Hi, mom.

1382

<i>Greg, Greg, where are you?</i>
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1383
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:13,334
Nothing.

1384
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:14,668
<i>Greg, are you all right?</i>

1385
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,128
I love you.

1386
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:18,547
<i>Greg. Greg.</i>

1387
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:23,886
Do you skateboard?

1388
01:10:23,969 --> 01:10:27,181
Yeah, well, I used to
when I lived in Boston.

1389
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:28,807
How long you live there?

1390
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,726
About, uh, 13 years,

1391
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:34,063
then I moved to
New York for a while,
and then I came here.

1392
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:35,648
Did you
like New York?

1393
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:37,066
No.

1394
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:39,109
Well, you're a long way
from Boston.

1395
01:10:39,193 --> 01:10:40,236
Yeah.

1396
01:10:40,361 --> 01:10:41,612
Why did you leave?

1397
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,240
I broke my probation.

1398
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:45,741
Yeah? What did you do?

1399
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:47,660
Assault and battery.

1400
01:10:47,743 --> 01:10:50,412
But that's bullshit,
I never should
have gotten it.

1401
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:53,332
All I did was
hit this teacher
after she tried to hit me

1402
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:57,753
and she never got in
trouble for it, fat bitch.

1403
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,839
If I saw her again,
I swear to god, I'd hit her.

1404
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:10,766
Jesus Christ, man,
you look like shit.

1405
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:17,898
So, your old man
got you busted, huh?

1406
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,192
Ah, yeah.

1407
01:11:20,693 --> 01:11:22,695
Man, life is
a real bitch.

1408
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:26,115
How long since
you slept, anyway?

1409
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:28,575
I don't know, four days?

1410
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,787
You gotta sleep, man.

1411
01:11:32,371 --> 01:11:34,039
Ah, it's too hard, man.

1412
01:11:34,331 --> 01:11:35,624
It's too hard.

1413
01:11:35,874 --> 01:11:37,334
You want some vodka?

1414
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:42,131
No, fuck that.
I could do that all night,
that ain't gonna help.

1415
01:11:42,256 --> 01:11:44,633
So, what do you
want me to do about it?

1416
01:11:45,551 --> 01:11:47,052
You want some help?

1417
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:48,804
Huh?

1418
01:11:51,181 --> 01:11:52,182
Yeah.

1419
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:53,726
What?

1420
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,978
Yeah, I do.

1421
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,938
All right.

1422
01:12:04,069 --> 01:12:05,612
Only doing this
so you can sleep.

1423
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,615
Starting tomorrow,
I want you to cut down
on your speed.

1424
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,242
Cheap-ass drug, man.

1425
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:15,039
Does it hurt?

1426
01:12:21,211 --> 01:12:22,546
Man, is it
gonna hurt?

1427
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:23,797
No.

1428
01:12:35,351 --> 01:12:36,560
Lights out, boy.

1429
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:43,734
You got the law after you.

1430
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:45,444
What?

1431
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,404
Yeah, they think
you killed Tommy Ray.

1432
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:48,781
Me?

1433
01:12:49,031 --> 01:12:50,657
I didn't kill him.
I didn't touch anybody.

1434
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,117
-I know you didn't.
-He didn't do anything.

1435
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,243
I know you didn't.

1436
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:54,620
I'm gonna kill Little J.

1437
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:57,206
Oh, man, I can't
go back to jail. I... I can't.

1438
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,208
What are you gonna do?

1439
01:12:59,333 --> 01:13:00,793
I don't know.

1440
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,753
Well, I'm leaving.

1441
01:13:03,587 --> 01:13:05,130
Where are you going?

1442
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,423
Dallas.

1443
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:09,385
Dallas.

1444
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:12,971
Yeah, Dallas.
You ought to come with me,
too. It's great there, man.

1445
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,014
Yeah, we should.

1446
01:13:14,098 --> 01:13:15,516
You wanna go
to Dallas?

1447
01:13:15,599 --> 01:13:17,059
I'm gonna get myself
a big old lady

1448
01:13:17,142 --> 01:13:18,602
with some fucking gnarly,
fucking...

1449
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:19,937
You know what I mean?

1450
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,648
Maybe a couple a pit bulls?
How'd that be, huh?

1451
01:13:22,731 --> 01:13:23,899
Sounds good,
doesn't it?

1452
01:13:24,024 --> 01:13:25,192
I don't know.

1453
01:13:25,526 --> 01:13:27,069
Well, don't think
about it too long, King.

1454
01:13:27,152 --> 01:13:28,320
'Cause as soon
as I score some speed,

1455
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,239
like I need it, I'm off
like a bride's nightie.

1456
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:35,953
What's that smell?

1457
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,204
That's you, motherfucker.

1458
01:13:37,287 --> 01:13:38,622
-That is you.
-That's you.

1459
01:13:38,705 --> 01:13:39,706
That's you.

1460
01:13:39,790 --> 01:13:40,916
You smell very bad.

1461
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:41,959
It's you.

1462
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,419
You're handsome devil,
but you stink.

1463
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:44,503
You stink.

1464
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,506
No, seriously, though,
man, you all ought
to come with me.

1465
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,508
Fuck, I'll tell you what.

1466
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,886
Why don't you
meet me back here
in, say, like a half hour?

1467
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:54,179
Come on, man,
Let's go!

1468
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,097
You're right.

1469
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:56,014
Fuck this place.

1470
01:13:56,098 --> 01:13:57,558
You're right.
I gotta get out, too.

1471
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,394
We'll get
Little J. and Greg,
and maybe we'll come.

1472
01:14:00,561 --> 01:14:03,730
Yeah.
Anyway, if I don't see you,
it's good knowing you.

1473
01:14:04,356 --> 01:14:05,566
Yeah, you... you, too.

1474
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:07,025
Yeah. Have a good life.

1475
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,777
It's nice to
meet you, Heather.

1476
01:14:09,111 --> 01:14:10,195
Take care.

1477
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,739
Later days
and better lays,
you all.

1478
01:14:18,328 --> 01:14:19,580
You didn't
do shit.

1479
01:14:19,663 --> 01:14:21,039
Yeah, well,
that doesn't matter.

1480
01:15:01,038 --> 01:15:02,498
I want you out of here.

1481
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,338
I want you out of here now!

1482
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,882
I heard you the first time!

1483
01:15:14,593 --> 01:15:17,846
No, don't hurt me.
Don't hurt me.
Please, don't hurt me.

1484
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:33,362
<i>Who's gonna make who</i>
<i>like chicken fingers, hmm?</i>

1485
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:07,813
Oh, fuck.

1486
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:10,899
You gave me shit, man.

1487
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,859
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1488
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,070
You tried to cheat me,
motherfucker!
You gave me shit!

1489
01:16:15,153 --> 01:16:18,782
Dig this, man!
I don't cheat nobody!
I don't cheat nobody!

1490
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:21,868
You wanna buy it
from somebody else,
kid, you do it.

1491
01:16:21,952 --> 01:16:23,495
'Cause I don't want to
sell to you no more.

1492
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,581
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, Ted.

1493
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,583
You just can't
handle it, man.

1494
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:29,334
-I can.
-Sit down.

1495
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,421
I'm sorry, man.

1496
01:16:34,047 --> 01:16:35,716
I... I didn't mean it, man.

1497
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:40,512
I'm sorry.

1498
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:44,391
You're practically
my brother, man.

1499
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:49,438
If I would have known you
couldn't handle the smack,
I never would have given it.

1500
01:16:49,521 --> 01:16:50,606
I can handle it.

1501
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:53,525
The fuck you can!
Look at you.

1502
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:55,736
You stink, man.

1503
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,112
What the hell is
wrong with you?

1504
01:16:57,195 --> 01:16:58,196
Nothing.

1505
01:16:58,280 --> 01:16:59,364
Nothing! Fuck that!

1506
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,158
I'll tell you
what's wrong with you.

1507
01:17:01,241 --> 01:17:03,577
You're a spoiled little shit
who's ended up on the streets

1508
01:17:03,660 --> 01:17:05,537
and thinks he's a bad man
with an attitude.

1509
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,289
You're nothing but a punk,
man. That's it!

1510
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:08,999
A punk who can't
handle his drugs!

1511
01:17:12,461 --> 01:17:14,129
Fucking pathetic.

1512
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,970
All right. From now on
it's cash only.

1513
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,100
Maybe that'll help you
slow down a little.

1514
01:17:27,434 --> 01:17:28,685
You still got cash,
don't you?

1515
01:17:33,190 --> 01:17:35,651
All right.
What do you want?

1516
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,490
A quarter?

1517
01:17:41,573 --> 01:17:44,076
No, I'll give you
a $20 piece.

1518
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:45,410
That's it.

1519
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:46,495
Okay.

1520
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:47,913
Show me your cash.

1521
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:57,339
Have you seen him?

1522
01:17:57,422 --> 01:17:59,091
You just missed him,
too bad for you.

1523
01:17:59,174 --> 01:18:01,218
He had a bunch of money,
bought me all this food.

1524
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:02,344
Where'd he go?

1525
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:03,512
Hey, hey!

1526
01:18:03,595 --> 01:18:04,721
Where'd he go?

1527
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:06,139
To score some speed
from Ted.

1528
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,058
Shit. Thanks.

1529
01:18:09,267 --> 01:18:11,978
Young love. Sheesh!

1530
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:16,900
You just do like
we said, all right?

1531
01:18:16,983 --> 01:18:18,360
Okay.

1532
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,154
Just leave it to me.
You stay in the hall.

1533
01:18:21,613 --> 01:18:22,656
You got your money?

1534
01:18:22,739 --> 01:18:23,865
Right here.

1535
01:18:28,995 --> 01:18:30,372
Is he here?

1536
01:18:31,289 --> 01:18:32,499
Ted.

1537
01:18:32,749 --> 01:18:33,917
Look out, Vikki.

1538
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,836
What the fuck? Ted!

1539
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:37,546
Ted, where's Greg?

1540
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:38,880
Greg's here, I know he is.

1541
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,006
What can
I do for you, man?

1542
01:18:40,090 --> 01:18:41,258
Just stay the fuck
out of my face.

1543
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,342
Sure.

1544
01:18:42,843 --> 01:18:43,844
Greg.

1545
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,558
Shit!

1546
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:51,560
What the hell
are you doing?

1547
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:53,395
-Hey, King.
-What are you doing?

1548
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:54,980
What's up, bro? What?

1549
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,357
Look at yourself.

1550
01:18:57,441 --> 01:18:58,316
What?

1551
01:18:58,400 --> 01:18:59,693
Look at yourself.
How do you feel?

1552
01:18:59,776 --> 01:19:01,069
It's cool, man.

1553
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,696
It's not cool, Greg!

1554
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:07,868
We're in big trouble,
all right?

1555
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,787
Little J., Heather, and I
are leaving on a bus tomorrow.

1556
01:19:10,871 --> 01:19:11,747
What happened?

1557
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:15,167
Somebody got shot, all right.
You're coming with us.

1558
01:19:15,459 --> 01:19:16,877
Where're we gonna go?

1559
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:18,587
I don't know.
Someplace cheap.

1560
01:19:18,670 --> 01:19:21,840
We... we'll just get on a bus
and go where it's going, okay?
What do you say?

1561
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,134
Will we be together?

1562
01:19:24,885 --> 01:19:26,762
Yeah, all of us.
All right?

1563
01:19:26,845 --> 01:19:27,846
Okay.

1564
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:30,015
All right. Just get, uh,
just get your shirt on.

1565
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:32,184
I can't, wait.
I'm too high for the street.

1566
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:35,061
Listen, you'll do
what I tell you to do,
when I tell you to do it.

1567
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:36,104
I'm too high, man.

1568
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:37,230
Listen.

1569
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:39,775
Look, no more drugs.
Here, take my money.

1570
01:19:40,358 --> 01:19:41,943
This doesn't
mean anything to me.

1571
01:19:42,027 --> 01:19:43,528
I can't believe
a word you're saying.

1572
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:44,529
On my honor.

1573
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,406
I just need to know
you're gonna be there.

1574
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:48,742
On my honor,
I'll be there.

1575
01:19:51,328 --> 01:19:52,996
I'm trusting you.

1576
01:19:53,288 --> 01:19:54,623
I promise.

1577
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,042
All right.
Noon. Noon.

1578
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:09,638
-What? What am I...
-What's wrong?

1579
01:20:09,721 --> 01:20:11,348
I tell Greg...
Where are we gonna go?

1580
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,642
What city?
We just gonna pick a city?

1581
01:20:15,101 --> 01:20:16,728
What's gonna change?

1582
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:22,943
Maybe we'll find
a freeway underpass,
or a nice squat.

1583
01:20:25,695 --> 01:20:28,990
Maybe I'll just
get my shit together
and get a job!

everything would be fine.

I have no right.
I can't promise anything.

to them.

1589

I just want them to see
how to look out for
themselves better.

1590
01:21:00,981 --> 01:21:02,440
They love you.

01:34:14,231 --> 01:34:15,691
Or do you see
yourself getting off it?

1734
01:34:15,775 --> 01:34:18,486
If you got a plan,
i'm willing to listen.

1735
01:34:18,569 --> 01:34:20,821
I'm just trying to,

1736
01:34:21,238 --> 01:34:23,491
You know, it's like,
what about love?

1737
01:34:24,575 --> 01:34:25,993
What about it?

1738
01:34:26,577 --> 01:34:28,829
What if you fell in
love with something?

1739
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:30,998
Wouldn't that
make a difference?

1740
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,170
Yeah. In fact,
I got somebody now.

1741
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:38,631
Who?

1742
01:34:39,382 --> 01:34:41,008
His name's Waldo.
Big, cute black guy.

1743
01:34:41,092 --> 01:34:42,385
I met him in the cellblock.

1744
01:34:42,468 --> 01:34:43,803
Really?

1745
01:34:43,886 --> 01:34:45,554
Yeah, sure.

1746
01:34:48,432 --> 01:34:50,434
No, just some chick I met.

1747
01:34:50,768 --> 01:34:51,894
Tell me about her.

1748
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:52,978
No.

1749
01:34:53,062 --> 01:34:53,979
Why not?

1750
01:34:54,063 --> 01:34:56,107
Because! Because
what's mine is mine.

1751
01:34:56,357 --> 01:35:00,945
And if I share it with you,
then it becomes less mine.
You understand?

1752
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:12,289
Her name's Heather.

1753
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,458
She's very beautiful.

1754
01:35:18,421 --> 01:35:20,297
So you got it out of me.

1755
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:23,717
You're such a character, King.

1756
01:35:23,801 --> 01:35:25,010
Fuck that.

1757
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:31,058
Look, can I get my $10
and get the hell
out of here, please?

1758
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,476
Why, sure.

1759
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:35,604
I think it was
a really good
session today.

1760
01:35:35,688 --> 01:35:37,148
Good.

1761
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:43,863
Are you okay?

1762
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:46,866
I'm fine.

1763
01:35:48,742 --> 01:35:49,994
You got a cigarette?

1764
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:51,245
Uh, yeah.

1765
01:35:51,328 --> 01:35:52,496
Thanks.

1766
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:56,876
Are you sure
you're okay?

1767
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,253
It's been a long time.

1768
01:36:03,841 --> 01:36:06,135
Look, I know
you just turned 18.

1769
01:36:06,218 --> 01:36:08,304
I don't know your history.

1770
01:36:08,971 --> 01:36:11,682
But maybe you want to think
about giving home a try.

1771
01:36:12,558 --> 01:36:14,059
My home's here.

1772
01:36:15,644 --> 01:36:16,729
