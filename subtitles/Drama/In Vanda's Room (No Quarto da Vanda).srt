2
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:09,500
- What's the matter ? - Breath not it.

3
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,500
With your greasy hands, you bitches all.

4
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,900
- What about you ? - I have them washed.

5
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,900
Here.

6
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,100
What warmth !

7
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,000
You are-and, merde!

8
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,600
It is good, this powder. Who gave it to you last?

9
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,400
Climax.

10
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,000
Climax! How horrible that name!

11
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,700
He was always stuffed with '' Climax. '' The name stuck.

12
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,100
What is the climax?

13
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:39,600
Damn, Vanda! You do not know that box?

14
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,400
Me no.

15
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,400
You've never been to the 'Cave' '?

16
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,700
But smoke, damn!

17
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,500
Fume !

18
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,100
You really sucks.

19
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,400
I have not the courage to make coke.

20
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,900
- Pass, I do. - You!

21
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,800
It's coming ?

22
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,900
Have you smoked?

23
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,600
Pango has found a pad.

24
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,200
- Who's Pango? - Nhurro.

25
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,700
Oh.

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,100
Nhurro, Pango, Yuran, Chumbito ... Il a des tas de noms.

27
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,300
It seems he has settled into the house of the girl who killed her kid.

28
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,900
I have not fishing.

29
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:26,200
Doing coke, Vanda.

30
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
Smoke it first. It décrassera you.

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,300
You're going to drink?

32
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,700
Non.

33
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
So not drink at all.

34
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,900
- Gaffe, shit! - It burned.

35
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,600
IN THE ROOM OF VANDA

36
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,500
Move on !

37
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,100
lack of bullshit.

38
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,300
Hurry!

39
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,500
Rub hard, I'm really dirty!

40
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,100
Nhurro!

41
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,900
I'm busy.

42
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's nice the cabinet.

43
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,900
My God, help me.

44
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,400
Vanda will make the tour.

45
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,100
You got the scissors, Zita?

46
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,300
I knew it.

47
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,500
The old woman had, had, had in his head ...

48
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,100
I too had but I lost my head.

49
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,500
Here.

50
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
A second, strawberries have not yet hardened enough.

51
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,700
It breaks me this fucking noise.

52
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,900
- You'll get me more? - You put in more?

53
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,700
- Damn, you saw mine and yours? - So what ?

54
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,100
Whore ! We can not talk to him without it begins to yell!

55
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,800
It's like that.

56
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,100
Shit!

57
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,600
Look at the state of this room!

58
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,800
It's on the bed I'm going to tidy up.

59
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,400
- You never crazy in a ream. - I'm going to tidy up.

60
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,100
I will clean this room, Zita and you too, Vanda.

61
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,600
And you will clean yours.

62
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,900
Come on, each his room. We'll see who finishes first.

63
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,800
One two Three...

64
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,600
Lena !

65
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,800
- Say, Anita. - You cassava?

66
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,800
No. Only Friday.

67
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,300
Only Friday.

68
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,700
Come in.

69
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,800
- Leave that ! - It's yours ?

70
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,700
Boots, futales ...

71
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,100
it really is joy here, everything is '' we ''.

72
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,900
- Mouth not shit! - The poor.

73
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,300
- You're really sad. - The sad thing is you.

74
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,100
- Sad shit. - The sad thing is you.

75
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,900
Mrs da Luz? Salad or cabbage?

76
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,200
Madame da Luz?

77
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Nuno ?

78
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,700
- Cabbages ? - No no.

79
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Bye.

80
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,900
Hey buddy, pay attention to Noah's Ark!

81
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,000
Noah's Ark will happen.

82
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,600
Noah's ark ?

83
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,800
How I'll take the covers? And all this stuff?

84
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,400
It's not much, but it's mostly the covers ...

85
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,700
- Mrs ! - Yes ?

86
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,100
- From the salad or cabbage? - No, I have no money.

87
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,700
Thank you.

88
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,900
You do not want? Thank you.

89
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,100
Madam salad?

90
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,600
Madame !

91
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,500
So there it is, Geny? They shaved your house?

92
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Geny! It will take you to sleep with me.

93
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,500
My poor little girl !

94
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,500
- Vire at that, please. - But where ?

95
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,400
In the trash there.

96
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,500
- Damn, I have to come down? - Come on, be nice.

97
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,900
- Vire me two buckets. - Right now ?

98
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,900
- Do it, be nice. - I go.

99
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,700
But damn, go ahead.

100
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,600
You see that I put, descends- them.

101
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Now ?

102
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:29,500
Go on, Nando, you may well do that for me! Go down those buckets.

103
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:33,700
I clean for us to be comfortable. Go ahead. Help me a little whore.

104
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,100
Give me a hand.

105
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,800
- the is put there? - No, outside.

106
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,300
- In the street ? - Yes.

107
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,300
Advanced.

108
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:12,000
Holy shit.

109
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,800
Vire me those buckets, Nando.

110
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,400
I go. Let me do me a shot.

111
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,200
Look, the guy went to get doses.

112
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,100
In the meantime, you can help me.

113
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,200
Okay, I'm going.

114
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,100
After my shoot, I'll start.

115
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,600
You sit down already? You sit not here.

116
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,900
Go on the couch.

117
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,500
Make the break. Sit on the couch.

118
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,700
- I am good like this. - Sit there.

119
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
You do not want to sit down? Can not you see that I put?

120
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,900
Upper !

121
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,500
It's boring!

122
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,900
My arms hurt.

123
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,200
I have to go pee.

124
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,800
Since that's not possible.

125
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
What crap!

126
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,300
That's it ?

127
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,700
You're done ?

128
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,400
Attends.

129
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,700
Miranda, Miranda.

130
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,100
Miranda...

131
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,600
You know who lived here, Nando?

132
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,300
The girl,

133
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,100
quite pretty,

134
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:36,600
one that wanted to sell his kid for 50 balls.

135
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,000
Larousse ? The one that threw her baby in a trash can?

136
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,100
Yes, I see that.

137
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,300
If she threw it in a bin or if she killed him,

138
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,300
this I know.

139
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,100
Pango, the house is great like that, right?

140
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,100
Good work.

141
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Give me a cigarette.

142
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,200
Thank you.

143
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,100
I tell you shit; my brother.

144
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,800
I put all the fruit.

145
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,000
If you are looking for red apples,

146
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,800
they are under the bananas, you've heard?

147
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,300
Mom, did you see?

148
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,900
I found that.

149
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,500
- Or ? - Over there.

150
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,100
Oh, good!

151
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,800
- Oh what? - Why you keep this thing?

152
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,300
It's an antique, andouille.

153
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,800
Someone had to take in someone's home.

154
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,700
It is in good condition.

155
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,800
There is a broken wire. This is not an antique that, Miranda?

156
00:31:56,100 --> 00:32:01,500
Do not you think I can get three hundred francs, down?

157
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,100
Look, there's just this broken wire there.

158
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:10,300
You had not seen him, Mom? He was behind the crates.

159
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,100
It lacks only son. but it can be replaced.

160
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,000
He is handsome, is not he ? It lacks one, there.

161
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
I thought you'd seen.

162
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:29,500
He was there, I found it by removing a crate.

163
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,900
Meaning ! He feels wax.

164
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,300
Wax or oil.

165
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,600
If Emilia saw him, she would like right away.

166
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,500
Do not put it there, it's dirty.

167
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,300
You have only to wash.

168
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,900
- Take it from off the fruit. - Take it yourself.

169
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,400
Do not put them there, we can not reach the TV.

170
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,700
You had not seen the boat?

171
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,900
- Look, he is in good condition. - He is magnificent.

172
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,100
But it is my boat, damn!

173
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,500
I put it near the crates to clean.

174
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,500
- He was behind the crates. - I forgot to take the fucking.

175
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:35,500
- It leaves us not even look at him. - I had asked for. He is mine.

176
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,300
It's good, it's yours.

177
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,800
Let us at least look!

178
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,600
It was there, it was me who found him.

179
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:52,700
It is in good condition. It lacks a thread.

180
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,000
Blankets, I can spin you.

181
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,100
Imagine if I had been in it.

182
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,200
- You'd be released in all ... - Smoked like a herring.

183
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,100
As a herring!

184
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,700
And if they had sprayed gasoline you ...

185
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,900
I who can not walk without my crutches, I had not a chance.

186
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,500
Not one, you grillais.

187
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,700
These kids are worse than ...

188
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,700
This is wickedness, they malice to the body.

189
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,500
They come from Nhurro district.

190
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:58,700
They are five or six, three black and two white.

191
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:08,300
There is one that is the type of pad where we slept before, you and me.

192
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Exact.

193
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,900
He is the artist who love this kind of number.

194
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,100
A real crazy.

195
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,400
People believed that the windows I was still in the can.

196
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,100
- While it burned? - Clear !

197
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,900
How sad !

198
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:41,300
If you were in, you spent there.

199
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:44,800
- Sure, how would I get out? - In addition, with the covers ...

200
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,500
Logic.

201
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,300
The essence, it does not forgive.

202
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,700
In addition, the reeds were dry around a roaring fire!

203
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,300
You remember an old sofa that was there?

204
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,200
- From sleeper sofa kind? - Yes, with backrest.

205
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,100
They also had to be swinging a match.

206
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,600
It took the fire rose to the reeds, and everything burnt.

207
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:20,900
My blankets in the can, my saps, all gone up in smoke.

208
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,300
- It really is wickedness. - Pure evil.

209
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,500
Yesterday I was in the can,

210
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,700
and they began to throw stones at me.

211
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,700
I started screaming to believe I was touched, so they stop.

212
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:49,700
Me, before yesterday I passed by the school.

213
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:57,300
The artist was there with two black guys.

214
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:04,800
They put themselves in the head strip me.

215
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,500
- Misery. - They knew...

216
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,900
that I had of the currency, guarantor cars.

217
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,100
They put themselves in the head that I had the money.

218
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,300
''File-nous ton cash,
file-nous ton cash''.

219
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,900
And I '' But I did not. ''

220
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,900
'' So jump, we hear parts or not. ''

221
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,700
And I jumped, you know? Of course I had the parts.

222
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:34,100
'' Empty your pockets and give '' and I have nothing left.

223
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:39,100
My luck, it was the arrival of the father of Vanda.

224
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,200
The black, you see?

225
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,500
It saved me.

226
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,600
They had already started the scalp dance and all the stuff.

227
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,300
Vanda's father, he worked with his shovel.

228
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,800
He has forbidden.

229
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,400
I went directly to the excavator.

230
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,100
I jumped into the dumpster.

231
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,400
He descended far, in Fontainhas.

232
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,100
Oh damn!

233
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,500
That way I'll be cold. Cold, cold, cold.

234
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,100
I'm cold, I'm cold. Cold, cold, cold.

235
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:58,300
In the Mouraria

236
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:03,300
at the corner of Rua da Palma.

237
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,900
One day,

238
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:20,400
I left my soul captive.

239
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:28,100
When passed by my side ...

240
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,100
Oh shit !

241
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,700
... dark-skinned,

242
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:45,300
the mocking gaze.

243
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,600
Vanda, vanda, vanda ...

244
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,700
Leave me alone.

245
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,600
Nhurro Hello!

246
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:14,600
You do not have a cigarette?

247
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,700
And I tell you shit a hundred times. See you.

248
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,000
Fatima, a martini please do!

249
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,800
- You want an ice cube? - Yes.

250
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,500
I'm ok thanks.

251
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,000
Vanda!

252
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,900
I heard about your sister Nela. It's sad.

253
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,200
Night is falling.

254
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,900
It is dark.

255
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:56,100
I should go buy candles.

256
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,500
Well, here Crutches.

257
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,700
Nhurro!

258
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,200
My God...

259
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,800
Father, help me.

260
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,900
Whore...

261
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:22,000
Fees?

262
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:26,100
I will die.

263
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,200
Go to sleep Paulo.

264
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,700
Evil never die. It is the innocent who die.

265
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:46,900
Tomorrow I would have you cut your hair.

266
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,500
Mom will see Nela to visit?

267
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,800
She even phoned.

268
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,500
- Why ? - For the money.

269
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,100
- Get out of here, bitch. - Get out yourself!

270
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,500
- My balls that I'm going out! - Bitch!

271
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,100
You make me crazy, imagine yourself even.

272
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,500
And you, you not imagine the hatred I keep you.

273
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,700
Get out! Just leave the camp of my room.

274
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,700
Can you imagine not hate ...

275
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,900
Do not you have more than me.

276
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,500
Fuck you put on!

277
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,700
Go there yourself. You ever age and a husband. Not me.

278
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,100
'' Find yourself a husband. ''

279
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,100
'' Find yourself a husband. '' Repeats Diogo.

280
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:55,300
Mom, it's broken tupperwear!

281
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:58,500
Your cake, Mom, the cops will put you into pieces.

282
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,500
They'll screw up.

283
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:11,200
They are afraid they stash the drugs.

284
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,900
Bit by bit they will search it.

285
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:25,000
And we'll see if they let the ham.

286
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,300
- Help me clean this pad. - I have my own store.

287
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,700
Lena, the kid still shit. You have to the exchange.

288
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:38,600
You're going to go dowdy like that?

289
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,100
With that hair?

290
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:45,400
- Put me stuff in bags. - I have the disgusting hands.

291
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,900
Zita, put it in bags.

292
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:52,300
They let the plastic bags.

293
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,300
The tupperwears first.

294
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,300
Put hot on the bottom.

295
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:01,800
They let the plastic bags.

296
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,600
- No, put that first. - Shut up !

297
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:20,400
- Did not you hear what she said? - What did she say ?

298
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:22,300
The warm background.

299
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,300
Hi Zita. You okay, Vanda?

300
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,100
- You bananas, my beautiful? - Who is it ?

301
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,500
You've found a roof, Paulo?

302
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,900
More or less.

303
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:22,000
Says. Where is it ?

304
01:00:23,700 --> 01:00:27,800
With Ginger. A shack on the side of Venda Nova.

305
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,800
I saw my old today.

306
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:50,100
She spoke to you?

307
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:54,100
When I saw it, I had tears in my eyes.

308
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,300
She was in the garden, she was digging. She tended the sprouts.

309
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:02,500
She looked at me: '' You're so skinny. ''

310
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:08,500
I put my hand in my pocket and I took everything I had money.

311
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:11,600
And I gave him.

312
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,500
'' What state are you?

313
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:18,200
You're all dirty, and your shoes ...

314
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,100
You make me sad.''

315
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:26,900
And she asked me: '' You have to eat, you feed you well? ''

316
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,300
'' Yes, I eat. ''

317
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,000
'' Sometimes I leave a dish in the oven,

318
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,500
to see if you come looking for him. ''

319
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:40,500
'' Every time I hope you come and get it. ''

320
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:46,500
I can not cross my old, it's too much sadness that falls on me.

321
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,700
Yuran, you'll end up killing her.

322
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,900
Do not call misfortune.

323
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:03,700
Paulo, we have to exchange our pumps.

324
01:02:05,100 --> 01:02:06,900
Leave yours, I'm on it.

325
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,300
No, mine is new.

326
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:12,800
- I just open it. - Newfoundland, you speak!

327
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:15,700
We'll share together tonight.

328
01:02:16,800 --> 01:02:19,100
- Do you how here. - Two.

329
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:24,900
I exchange the trailer.

330
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:31,300
I exchange the trailer.

331
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:37,900
I just open one and the other there not long ago.

332
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:46,000
They are not bad.

333
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:48,500
They are not bad at all.

334
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:51,500
If you knew the shit that I was already passed on.

335
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,200
I balance everything.

336
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,700
And that cigarette, that's today?

337
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,900
Well, Yuran, I'm going to win.

338
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,200
- And I tell you shit. - Good luck Paulo.

339
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:16,000
I tell you shit too.

340
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,900
May God our Lord be with me.

341
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,400
What is it ?

342
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:52,600
This is Crutches silver spoon to eat his yogurt.

343
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,300
Who is it ?

344
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,800
You made me look good, you!

345
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,700
That depresses me.

346
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,200
I entered as a doomed.

347
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:10,100
- Ah yes ? - Yes, as a convicted ...

348
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:14,100
They put you right back to the hole, Carla? On leaving the station?

349
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,300
Yes, at five o'clock in the morning they took me to the station.

350
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,400
Immediately in the cage.

351
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,100
What a pain !

352
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,500
Meanwhile, they made ...

353
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:26,700
I do not know what it's called.

354
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,700
- The prison number, anything. - Paper to put me in jail.

355
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:33,500
I left the office at nine in the morning.

356
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:36,000
At eleven o'clock I was in the closet.

357
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:39,500
You can not wear jeans ...

358
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,800
- Inside? - That cotton trousers.

359
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:44,900
And you must always wear a blouse.

360
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,600
- Ah yes ? - Blue?

361
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:52,300
- It depends, there are several colors. - See you. I come again.

362
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:57,200
Imagine, they must wear a gown.

363
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:02,800
All for Knorr cubes, whore. This is the jail. It's like that.

364
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:10,600
Must say she has a past.

365
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:13,800
Eight years of flight, it counts.

366
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,100
But shit, falling for Knorr cubes!

367
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,500
We never saw that.

368
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,400
It only exists in Lisbon.

369
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:36,500
But shit, three! Knorr cubes!

370
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,500
Vanda, you did not hear what she said? It is not a beginner.

371
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,500
But she often squeeze and each time trial.

372
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:51,400
Three times she should have been released three times, a new trial.

373
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:58,000
I know who left it to them was another thing.

374
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,900
- And immediately they returned there. - That is true. They seek you.

375
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,200
Zeninhas example ...

376
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:12,300
He goes out and after one week out they come looking for it.

377
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:16,500
They emerged a conviction. And he did his time.

378
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,100
Of course.

379
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:20,700
How many ?

380
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:22,900
This I do not know.

381
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,500
Damn, it's hard.

382
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,500
It's worse than tough.

383
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,900
Falling, I want to think about it.

384
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,400
Ni moi.

385
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,600
Fall,

386
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,500
for Knorr cubes. Jesus. We never saw that!

387
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,800
Arrest someone for bouillon cubes.

388
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,500
I'm sure this is the first that goes to the closet,

389
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,700
with such an accusation.

390
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:03,500
'' I am in prison for Knorr bouillon flight! ''

391
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:10,900
It is sad, really sad our country.

392
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:14,600
It is the poorest and that's the sad part.

393
01:10:36,300 --> 01:10:39,600
So many years of suffering in the hands of my father.

394
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,200
After twenty-four years, he left with nothing.

395
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,700
Sad ! She was hungry for the eating.

396
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,400
I will never forgive him.

397
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:54,400
Poor mom!

398
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,300
Damn, it's a miracle if my sister Zita is with us.

399
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:04,300
When Mom was eight months

400
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:10,900
he crushed his stomach between two chairs.

401
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:14,300
He almost killed her.

402
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,400
It's a miracle.

403
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:21,500
Me, it revolts me.

404
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,800
The '' N '' is not very good.

405
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,300
No credit today! Only tomorrow.

406
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,900
Tomorrow. Not today !

407
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:16,900
The devil take me if I do not display it.

408
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,800
It is your new secret pad where I can go with you?

409
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:02,700
They say nothing Crutches.

410
01:13:17,700 --> 01:13:19,300
You're getting old.

411
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:21,000
I'll say, '' Nela, stop your bullshit. If you continue,

412
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:24,000
you will not see me again, nor I, nor anyone. ''

413
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,600
I could not call. We do not leave me.

414
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:33,700
Otherwise, I would have done as Nela. I would not stop calling.

415
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,600
She should not ask that!

416
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:44,900
I would have asked for thirty bullets. Dope, not money.

417
01:14:45,200 --> 01:14:48,000
What would I do with money at the hospital?

418
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:53,500
Finally, there were at hand.

419
01:14:53,800 --> 01:14:57,100
If I had known earlier, damn it!

420
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:06,500
Do not you imagine the work to find a piece of aluminum.

421
01:15:07,300 --> 01:15:13,700
I thought as drawers in the house, packed with aluminum ... Hell!

422
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,300
And I, here, with the aluminum, dope and all.

423
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,700
I took the thing thermometers, this iron thing where they are arranged.

424
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:28,000
I took it, I lit the lighter 'Sauvé, I found something to smoke.' '

425
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:40,000
I'd even used the pool provided the '' drop '' sink.

426
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:42,300
'' Vanda, you will not go with it. ''

427
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:45,300
I had brought the aluminum you, dope and all.

428
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:48,400
But Miranda took everything from me.

429
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:55,300
Miranda and I had to put a mask to see you.

430
01:15:55,600 --> 01:16:00,100
After I not get it off. My hair was caught in the knot.

431
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:03,500
The more I tried, the less I arrived. '' Miranda, remove it to me! ''

432
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,500
He is done...

433
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:12,400
'' Take me this stuff! I can not do, it chokes me! ''

434
01:16:13,300 --> 01:16:16,300
You see the kind of anguish, pockets stuffed, too.

435
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:22,600
It's a real fucking pain, what you think.

436
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:26,400
The real suffering is to know that one can consume.

437
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:34,000
Exact. Knowing that she will go home and eat.

438
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:41,100
Damn, what I have not! I tore the perf, and all ...

439
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:46,900
How many times I went to the window! And I fell.

440
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,900
Skinny as I was, my legs were not me.

441
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:51,700
Me, I would have escaped.

442
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:57,300
I'm surrounded by wankers.

443
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:01,900
No one helps me, that broken arm.

444
01:17:05,600 --> 01:17:07,300
Damn, you're shit.

445
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:11,300
What do you still want me? You kidding.

446
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:16,700
Breathe. Let me make my shot and I go out without your garbage problem.

447
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:25,300
It would go well here with modern wallpaper with flowers.

448
01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,500
If you knew what I enjoyed with my bruises.

449
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,100
- Stop whining. - But I was right, man.

450
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:36,100
If you had paid all the crap I've ever had ...

451
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,100
Seven or eight bruises!

452
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,300
You, you'd live in fear.

453
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:43,100
I was a walking bruise.

454
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:47,900
Once the shaking was so violent,

455
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,800
that the pump is blocked by itself.

456
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:55,200
This one was tough, man. An internal hematoma.

457
01:17:55,800 --> 01:18:00,300
He took all the tendons, all, to block my leg.

458
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:03,100
It lasted three days and three nights.

459
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:09,200
It rained and the sun, and even rain. I was shaking in my blanket.

460
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,700
I ended up dying it myself.

461
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,200
I the morning without my 'Serenal' 'I not booted.

462
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:19,100
Only after it is infected, because I had done wrong ...

463
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,300
Before I walked to '' Serenal '' ...

464
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:23,900
I have not dressing on weekends,

465
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:27,500
and neck hematoma swelled, so swollen,

466
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:33,000
on Monday by going to the hospital and I pressed the pus spurted.

467
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:37,600
If I was not my '' Serenal '' I could hardly walk.

468
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:40,900
I was in the emergency and a girl,

469
01:18:41,200 --> 01:18:44,700
injected me with something in the neck,

470
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,100
to make me out the eyes of the orbits.

471
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,500
It was the kind Antral or Antrax.

472
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:59,100
I think the bruises I had,

473
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:01,100
it is a side effect of '' Serenal ''.

474
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,700
A hematoma on the left ribs, another on the right ribs.

475
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,300
That of the right ribs, I have already burst.

476
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,700
I have one left foot ...

477
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:17,600
Show me.

478
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:20,400
- Two on the coasts. - Ah yes ?

479
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,700
I got a neck, the same time as that of the leg.

480
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:26,300
You've got a neck?

481
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,100
- Later, the neck popped. - But I'm talking about the neck.

482
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:36,300
But then I took antibiotics, blood, live.

483
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,500
Let me take a puff, Nando.

484
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,700
That was when I went to the hospital,

485
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:47,700
after puncturing the hematoma of the leg.

486
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,700
On leaving the hospital, I make a right arm.

487
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,100
What about me? One on each foot. Do you remember ?

488
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,100
One on each foot and an arm.

489
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,100
It's this one.

490
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:03,500
Finally, the guys who won the championship this year?

491
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,900
C'est Benfica ... no, Porto.

492
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,700
No, I'm talking bruises.

493
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,800
Fuck you, Nhurro!

494
01:20:14,300 --> 01:20:20,000
The little old, I was impressed. It looked Carabosse.

495
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:23,900
She walked with his cane like that.

496
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,900
A little old jail!

497
01:20:27,200 --> 01:20:29,300
Vanda will make your tour!

498
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,500
Only old there.

499
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,200
But you know, you can walk everywhere.

500
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:49,100
'' Ouch, bring me drugs!

501
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:52,900
- If you need money, we bring you, but drugs, not ''.

502
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,500
But I'll bring it next time, a dose or two.

503
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:00,300
I will do it.

504
01:21:00,600 --> 01:21:03,100
One day, you'll stay there, and I'll not see you.

505
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,800
When I stay, I will stay.

506
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,300
So it hath more there?

507
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:13,300
There is a bar and all ...

508
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:17,700
It's not the bars, as it is said.

509
01:21:18,100 --> 01:21:22,200
This is the fence like the one we have for rabbits.

510
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,100
And in his cell either, it's not the bars.

511
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,700
This is glass with wire mesh in it.

512
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:38,800
This is far from the search and the three flags.

513
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,400
And to find Nela

514
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,600
it is a hassle.

515
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:58,500
She has a sword to kill: the end of our race.

516
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,000
A sword ?

517
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,600
She did it with the bed roasting

518
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,900
- I assure you. - You speak !

519
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,100
It's crazy. That's jokes.

520
01:22:10,700 --> 01:22:12,500
Next time I bring him.

521
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:15,000
You have only to tell the guard that's for you.

522
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:17,700
No, Grandma, I hide in my dentures.

523
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,300
- There instead. - Pile instead.

524
01:22:20,600 --> 01:22:23,700
Go do your tour. Hurry up !

525
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,900
Their machines guess anything except metal.

526
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:30,500
I can bring anything metal.

527
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:33,100
Lina, they searched everywhere.

528
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:39,900
Nela was chatting with a babysitter.

529
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:45,300
A woman I know. A chance to have met her.

530
01:22:47,200 --> 01:22:49,700
- Who is that ? - One of my clients.

531
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,500
She is the guardian.

532
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,000
As soon as she saw me, she said: '' Ah, the little vegetable seller. ''

533
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:01,400
On Friday, I go back.

534
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:52,100
Mrs da Luz? Salad or cabbage?

535
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:54,600
Excuse me, I'm tired.

536
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,800
- I put you how? - A.

537
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,100
Thank you.

538
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:01,100
Goodbye.

539
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:12,200
Nuno! Cabbage, salad?

540
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:15,600
No ? Thank you.

541
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:20,100
Cabbage, salad? Thank you.

542
01:24:24,200 --> 01:24:25,800
Some salad ?

543
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,900
Some salad ?

544
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:00,500
Shit !

545
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,900
Where are my keys ?

546
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:06,000
Some salad ?

547
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:13,000
Fuck, Ginger, do not do that. It's not worth it, leave the table.

548
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:17,000
It's not worth it.

549
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,700
Please.

550
01:25:20,300 --> 01:25:23,700
I have already said that this table is there. Stopped.

551
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:27,500
If you are not you taking the table, I take it.

552
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,600
Up to you.

553
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,700
This table is here.

554
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:48,500
Ginger, where did you stashed the fleet?

555
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:50,900
She's there.

556
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:19,200
Stop it, damn. I'm fed up !

557
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:32,200
You are stubborn to ten.

558
01:26:33,400 --> 01:26:36,500
This chair, it takes him.

559
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:41,600
We will not let her.

560
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:03,900
Ginger! Ice, take her?

561
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:11,500
Shit, Ginger!

562
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,300
Oh, Ginger!

563
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,300
Damn, we will spend one more night here!

564
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,700
We will still freeze.

565
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:36,900
I plates, cutlery ...

566
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:39,400
Forget it, forget it.

567
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,900
Pans, plates, forks,

568
01:27:50,200 --> 01:27:53,500
we have everything you need there to eat.

569
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:55,800
Do not worry.

570
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:02,900
The mattress is nickel, very hard,

571
01:28:03,300 --> 01:28:07,400
and as I have a bad back ...

572
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:12,100
The best for you is to sleep on the floor.

573
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:18,600
The best for me? What are you looking for ?

574
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,000
I tell you that it is nickel,

575
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:26,100
I have a bad back ...

576
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,400
And you want me to sleep on the floor!

577
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,500
So guys, it bathes? There will be a place for me there?

578
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,300
- No. - Good.

579
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,000
Tu as vu ce naze?

580
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:48,600
What are we sailed yet? The sneakers ?

581
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:07,800
You're really stubborn.

582
01:29:08,300 --> 01:29:09,700
They will raze the house.

583
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:13,500
Not stubborn. Ordered. It's not the same thing.

584
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:20,400
Being stubborn, that's one thing. Another is to be designed.

585
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,200
Leave me peace. I like things rows, that's all.

586
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:49,600
On May 13 in Fatima, that's thousands of people.

587
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,900
For sellers, it's mine!

588
01:29:56,200 --> 01:29:57,900
For pickpockets.

589
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:00,400
For the pros.

590
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:07,100
I've never been on the thirteenth.

591
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:10,900
I'm already gone, but not three. Here.

592
01:30:18,300 --> 01:30:19,700
Pass the lighter.

593
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,800
May is the most beautiful month.

594
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:37,000
He cherries, Notre Dame.

595
01:30:37,600 --> 01:30:40,500
This is the month of Vanda. The class.

596
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:59,200
I can not stop thinking about Nela

597
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,600
That's why I do not go there.

598
01:31:07,900 --> 01:31:10,900
This is the first time I enter in a prison.

599
01:31:11,200 --> 01:31:12,700
I do not like that.

600
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:16,700
The hospital is the same. After I stop over thinking people.

601
01:31:19,100 --> 01:31:21,200
Damn, this is serious.

602
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:29,200
On arrival, she was looking me eyes, she not see me. And I: '' Nela! ''

603
01:31:30,200 --> 01:31:33,200
She took me in his arms and kissed me.

604
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,500
If I came away with the other, Zita,

605
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:42,000
they would still be looking for me.

606
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:48,700
I was wrong. I wrote my name instead of hers.

607
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:53,300
I had not read '' Owned ''

608
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:58,100
and I put my name.

609
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,300
And '' relationship '' I put '' sister ''.

610
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:05,500
When I heard the girl in the speaker,

611
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:10,900
'' There is a Vanda in the pavilion? Vanda Maria Pires Duarte. ''

612
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,100
And I: 'No, no, excuse me! Vanda Maria, it's me. ''

613
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:19,100
'' She is my sister, Manuela Duarte Fernanda Pires ''.

614
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:24,600
'' You're wrong. Repeat a listing. ''

615
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:31,100
She called the three pavilion. Pile where was the '' Duchesse ''.

616
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:37,000
I did not know there were so many pavilions.

617
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:44,400
With numbers and this circus.

618
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:48,600
Without the number, I would have lost.

619
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:53,100
I can not stop thinking about it.

620
01:32:56,200 --> 01:32:58,500
How sad !

621
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:49,600
I really dirty hair.

622
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,300
I look like a bum.

623
01:33:56,200 --> 01:33:59,900
In addition, with the dirt they grow faster.

624
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:04,800
Water and soap.

625
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:14,500
That would leave all this filth.

626
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,700
We really need me to.

627
01:34:31,200 --> 01:34:33,100
I parked cars ...

628
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,300
I was a thief ...

629
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,400
I was mason ...

630
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:54,000
I was server ...

631
01:35:07,100 --> 01:35:09,500
And I know more what I can ...

632
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:24,100
What I can do in this world.

633
01:35:46,100 --> 01:35:47,500
It's incredible !

634
01:35:55,800 --> 01:35:57,700
They came back.

635
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,500
Vanda is how red apples?

636
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:48,000
- Four or five francs? - Four.

637
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:56,100
- Five. That's Vanda? - Four.

638
01:37:35,400 --> 01:37:37,200
Where is the aluminum?

639
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:38,900
Here it is.

640
01:37:50,200 --> 01:37:51,700
Diogo cry!

641
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:59,300
- Go see Zita! - Go yourself!

642
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,900
Want to buy a silver spoon?

643
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:37,700
5 francs !

644
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:15,100
It is in that here? I can get myself a tranquil shot?

645
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:19,100
You think it is your mother's cunt or what?

646
01:39:20,000 --> 01:39:23,100
- I was just asking. - Get out!

647
01:39:24,600 --> 01:39:27,300
- You're the guy with crutches? - Yes, it's me Crutches.

648
01:39:27,600 --> 01:39:29,500
- You know who I am ? - I know.

649
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,500
- Damn Redhead! What sleeve! - I'm getting not fuck.

650
01:39:35,800 --> 01:39:37,400
Try with this pump.

651
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:41,700
The needle twists. Your neck is that the wedge.

652
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,700
The wedge?

653
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,700
My luck is great.

654
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:51,500
I know it's great! It's pumps are damned.

655
01:39:55,000 --> 01:39:56,400
You fired the air?

656
01:39:57,300 --> 01:39:59,200
You think I'm freak or what?

657
01:40:02,700 --> 01:40:04,500
Damn this is long.

658
01:40:19,500 --> 01:40:21,500
- That's it ? - Not yet.

659
01:40:24,900 --> 01:40:28,100
Shit, Paulo, remains quiet.

660
01:40:29,000 --> 01:40:31,700
- Attention not miss the vein. - But no.

661
01:40:37,500 --> 01:40:41,900
Before, I was really addicted to coke ...

662
01:40:42,300 --> 01:40:44,900
You ever look better.

663
01:40:45,600 --> 01:40:48,300
You have perked up. You're so thin.

664
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:53,200
- But I have trouble breathing. - Me too.

665
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:55,500
I get tired very quickly.

666
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:58,500
As soon as I walk a little, I'm exhausted.

667
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:00,700
The morning is one of those cough ...

668
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:04,200
I'll give you stuff but it will take them.

669
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,600
I will take them.

670
01:41:05,900 --> 01:41:07,900
- Pedro ! - Juré.

671
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,900
This is what I take when I have trouble breathing.

672
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,100
And if you do not take ...

673
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:17,100
I swear on the head of my grandmother that I will do anything for you.

674
01:41:17,400 --> 01:41:19,300
I can even get one now.

675
01:41:19,600 --> 01:41:22,000
You do not imagine how it's expensive.

676
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,700
It is tablet for the lack of air. Really good.

677
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:29,100
- It should not take too much, right? - Oh no!

678
01:41:31,100 --> 01:41:34,900
You know what scared me? I thought I had tuberculosis.

679
01:41:35,900 --> 01:41:37,300
Take care of yourself.

680
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,900
If one eats bad ...

681
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,100
There the food but mainly, Pedro,

682
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:43,700
must never shoot up with another pump.

683
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:47,500
I never do. But where I sleep,

684
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,400
Once I stood barefoot

685
01:41:52,700 --> 01:41:54,800
and a needle planted myself in the foot.

686
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,000
Be careful, Pedro.

687
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,700
I'll give you tablets to the lack of air.

688
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:05,900
I'm scared to go for analysis.

689
01:42:06,700 --> 01:42:09,100
It is to avoid Ventolin.

690
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,100
One can become addicted to Ventolin. You know ?

691
01:42:14,200 --> 01:42:16,200
Where are these tablets crap?

692
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:23,100
I have trouble breathing, I use the sprayer and all.

693
01:42:23,400 --> 01:42:26,300
- You have asthma then? - Not really. It starts just ...

694
01:42:26,600 --> 01:42:29,900
- But I'm probably. - So, we're all in the same state.

695
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:35,600
You, me, the guy Paulo Geny, all alike.

696
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,900
- And Geny, you see? From one day to another ! - Yes, the poor.

697
01:42:39,200 --> 01:42:41,700
But when I damn these tablets?

698
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,300
I went avenue of Uruguay ..

699
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:50,000
To see this lady, Rosa, who used to help me.

700
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:53,100
She lives on the seventh, you know.

701
01:42:53,600 --> 01:42:56,500
I ring down, the door opens.

702
01:42:58,200 --> 01:43:01,400
I enter. There is disappointment! The elevator down.

703
01:43:02,000 --> 01:43:07,000
T'imagines, climb to 7 th. my crutches!

704
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:10,700
I have to climb seven floors.

705
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,400
Flat, bloody, dead.

706
01:43:14,000 --> 01:43:15,700
I get up, knock,

707
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:18,300
'' You alright Rosa? - Very well thank you.

708
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,400
- And your husband too? - He's fine, thank you God.

709
01:43:22,200 --> 01:43:24,800
- You'd have a little something for me?

710
01:43:25,100 --> 01:43:26,700
- I'll see what I can do.''

711
01:43:30,100 --> 01:43:32,600
She comes back and refile me two yogurts.

712
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,900
- It refile you what? - Two yogurts.

713
01:43:37,100 --> 01:43:42,500
Damn, two yogurts! Fuck I was, I was hoping money.

714
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,700
I put yogurt in my bag. And down,

715
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,700
I prayed for them to be strawberry.

716
01:43:55,500 --> 01:43:58,500
I would have killed the old.

717
01:43:59,700 --> 01:44:02,500
I do not expect it

718
01:44:04,600 --> 01:44:06,600
be so mean.

719
01:44:09,400 --> 01:44:13,900
We did not want to be rude but sometimes

720
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:16,400
circumstances will push you!

721
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:24,300
Provided there is the strawberry pieces!

722
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:28,100
Paulo, I had one of those fluke!

723
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:33,700
I managed to sting a blackbird,

724
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:37,200
a golden, not a standard black,

725
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:39,500
a blackbird colorful.

726
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:43,900
And I went down to the gypsy quarter.

727
01:44:44,500 --> 01:44:48,600
I went to the old well that gets off the birds.

728
01:44:48,900 --> 01:44:50,200
Two sugar packets.

729
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:53,500
I caused him to see if he bought it, and the old man said no.

730
01:44:54,800 --> 01:44:56,400
It'll be great.

731
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:01,300
But when I told him it was a golden blackbird ...

732
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,800
... he was hooked.

733
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:06,100
There must be a spoon there, Redhead.

734
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,200
Be nice, going to get me.

735
01:45:08,600 --> 01:45:10,300
He really flashed.

736
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:13,300
A great deal. I won six sacks.

737
01:45:13,600 --> 01:45:15,800
There was another ...

738
01:45:17,000 --> 01:45:19,400
It must be in yellow basket.

739
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:23,900
... but it was not a nice golden brown.

740
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:31,200
Take the candle, be nice. My leg hurts.

741
01:45:31,500 --> 01:45:36,300
Apart from gold, nothing to bite, it was the only one that was worth it.

742
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,500
C'mon, man, I can not, it hurts too much.

743
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,400
The old man asked me to find canaries.

744
01:45:44,700 --> 01:45:48,100
I fucking hurts. Hurry up ! I have to go do my tour.

745
01:45:48,400 --> 01:45:52,500
I do not know where is your spoon Paulo. We put everything in the bags.

746
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,100
Without my spoon, I can not eat my yogurt.

747
01:45:55,400 --> 01:45:58,600
Damn, is it! You are blind or what?

748
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:02,400
Here. It will come in search!

749
01:46:03,800 --> 01:46:07,000
But you really have to take them.

750
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:08,700
We take the how?

751
01:46:09,000 --> 01:46:10,300
Every eight hours.

752
01:46:10,600 --> 01:46:13,300
At seven o'clock, three o'clock in the afternoon,

753
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:15,400
and eleven at night. It's the best.

754
01:46:16,800 --> 01:46:19,700
When they are finished, come in search. We must take them!

755
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,300
When you return, I will give you the syrup.

756
01:46:22,600 --> 01:46:25,100
On leaving, I take one.

757
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,200
This is to help breathing, right?

758
01:46:27,500 --> 01:46:30,300
Yes and syrup too. Rate not hours!

759
01:46:33,300 --> 01:46:38,300
Geny, she went out to beg like everyday.

760
01:46:38,600 --> 01:46:41,900
She had become so thin, so weak that he had to carry her in his arms.

761
01:46:42,200 --> 01:46:45,700
wear from here to the market. What misery !

762
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,300
That is true.

763
01:46:47,600 --> 01:46:51,800
She is out, too.

764
01:46:53,100 --> 01:46:58,300
In the evening I was told: '' Geny is dead. '' I did not believe it.

765
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,100
Neither do I.

766
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:02,900
She was the inning with Fragata, right?

767
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:04,800
I do not know.

768
01:47:05,100 --> 01:47:07,900
She collapsed suddenly. At the foot of Fragata, I think.

769
01:47:08,200 --> 01:47:09,200
It's sad.

770
01:47:09,500 --> 01:47:11,700
He called an ambulance. She did not get on.

771
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:14,900
Sacred Geny.

772
01:47:15,200 --> 01:47:17,800
Later they called another.

773
01:47:19,200 --> 01:47:22,000
There, it is mounted,

774
01:47:22,300 --> 01:47:24,600
but she arrived died in the hospital.

775
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:26,400
You realize.

776
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:31,100
Paulo out more.

777
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:35,700
It's Geny that would find the twenty bags for his doses of the night.

778
01:47:37,000 --> 01:47:38,700
And he was waiting.

779
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,700
It was not even fucking be fifty balls.

780
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,100
It was cowardly of him.

781
01:47:44,400 --> 01:47:46,500
Yes, it's unbelievable.

782
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:49,700
He said he could not.

783
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,100
You you have mastered it!

784
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,900
When we really need, we always get there.

785
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:56,500
Of course.

786
01:47:56,800 --> 01:48:00,500
I told him a thousand times: '' When you're stuck, you get there. ''

787
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,100
It's clear.

788
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:07,200
Now he makes an effort for her little morning dose.

789
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:08,900
You clearly see.

790
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:14,200
It is a combination with cotton. Me and Julio was tired.

791
01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:17,300
It is that guys who fall in and out.

792
01:48:17,600 --> 01:48:20,900
When this is over, he will have to be doing like the others.

793
01:48:21,200 --> 01:48:22,700
Nothing else to do.

794
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,400
And Julio, you see? It was going so well ...

795
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:28,100
Yes. He relapsed.

796
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:29,400
He relapsed serious.

797
01:48:29,700 --> 01:48:32,900
And go again. At this time, it should already be well ...

798
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,800
I met him this morning, but not since.

799
01:48:36,100 --> 01:48:37,900
He just passed.

800
01:48:40,000 --> 01:48:41,900
- Sacred Julio. - He really suffered.

801
01:48:42,200 --> 01:48:44,800
He did it to dry. He drank like a beast.

802
01:48:45,100 --> 01:48:46,900
So imagine dry.

803
01:48:48,200 --> 01:48:50,100
- I could not have. - Neither do I.

804
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:53,500
I am so afraid of missing. That's what makes me most afraid.

805
01:48:53,800 --> 01:48:55,000
To me too.

806
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:12,300
Do not you want my flowers?

807
01:49:12,600 --> 01:49:14,300
No, I have no money.

808
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:17,200
- They are not expensive. - I do not have money.

809
01:49:20,200 --> 01:49:21,900
I let them.

810
01:49:23,400 --> 01:49:25,700
- Put them in a vase. - Thank you.

811
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:28,800
You want to take in the cemetery.

812
01:49:29,100 --> 01:49:32,400
They do not let in the real flowers.

813
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:34,700
That plastic flowers!

814
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:36,800
I did not know. In the new cemetery?

815
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,000
Yes.

816
01:49:38,300 --> 01:49:40,100
This is the first time I hear that.

817
01:49:40,400 --> 01:49:42,900
That plastic flowers ... Thank you.

818
01:49:43,200 --> 01:49:44,300
You're welcome. Hello.

819
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:45,800
Hello. Goods.

820
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:51,800
I can not send you money for your cigarettes.

821
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:55,000
I have no money, I have nothing, I can not.

822
01:51:01,600 --> 01:51:03,700
One cartridge, but it's expensive.

823
01:51:07,800 --> 01:51:10,300
I have no money!

824
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:21,100
You too. Goodbye.

825
01:51:21,800 --> 01:51:24,600
I have no money, I can not.

826
01:54:08,700 --> 01:54:09,900
Ouch, Mom.

827
01:54:52,000 --> 01:54:53,100
Ouch, Mom.

828
01:56:17,200 --> 01:56:21,500
Hurry up, it's almost over. And the sun has not disappeared completely.

829
01:56:25,100 --> 01:56:26,900
On television, we see better.

830
01:56:28,600 --> 01:56:31,100
- The sun grows, right? - Yes.

831
01:57:42,200 --> 01:57:45,300
It's time, guys. We abandon the ship.

832
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,300
I'll get you.

833
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:54,300
Already one week

834
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:57,900
that you're stashed there.

835
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:03,600
You're not smart, you're a beef.

836
01:58:06,900 --> 01:58:08,300
I've had. You lost.

837
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:14,600
The floor is tiled. It lacks the doors.

838
01:58:17,000 --> 01:58:19,300
Top it has windows,

839
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:23,700
when we sleep, nobody can enter.

840
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:28,000
Downstairs, the only downside is the doors, but otherwise ...

841
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:41,500
Well painted walls, a real home,

842
01:58:41,800 --> 01:58:43,500
all clean, nothing is dirty.

843
01:58:43,800 --> 01:58:46,000
Will just do the housework.

844
01:58:46,800 --> 01:58:48,700
I hope I forget anything.

845
01:58:50,200 --> 01:58:52,300
That's all we have to do.

846
01:59:01,300 --> 01:59:02,600
My keys ?

847
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:40,400
This is the last time I tell you: do not be disrespectful.

848
01:59:40,700 --> 01:59:43,200
Otherwise, it is paid.

849
01:59:43,500 --> 01:59:47,100
In my country, it will not be like this,

850
01:59:48,800 --> 01:59:51,200
This is the Portuguese justice emptiness.

851
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:57,800
You believe you can do what want.

852
02:00:00,700 --> 02:00:04,500
Every injury, should be fined.

853
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:07,000
I picked you, you!

854
02:00:08,600 --> 02:00:12,400
In Cape Verde, you should have already received a lesson!

855
02:00:13,500 --> 02:00:15,200
You think you are?

856
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:19,000
Here, it is not you who make the law.

857
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:23,700
Here, it still belongs to my father.

858
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:27,100
In Portugal, you respect nothing.

859
02:00:29,600 --> 02:00:31,700
A girl should never forget respect.

860
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,000
And what else!

861
02:00:33,300 --> 02:00:36,300
- Otherwise it must be severely punished. - Respect, I pat myself.

862
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:38,300
You do not even respected thyself!

863
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:43,400
All day on your bed You not working, you're not rise up.

864
02:00:43,700 --> 02:00:46,900
Locked up in your room day and night.

865
02:00:48,300 --> 02:00:50,500
How can you live?

866
02:00:53,100 --> 02:00:55,500
You're never go out.

867
02:00:58,800 --> 02:01:00,400
In my island...

868
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,800
have to get up at three in the morning.

869
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:06,300
We will work with pick and shovel,

870
02:01:06,600 --> 02:01:08,400
or we will pick herbs.

871
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:11,700
And we try to get by. Both men and women.

872
02:01:12,000 --> 02:01:14,800
It's like that every day,

873
02:01:15,900 --> 02:01:18,100
of both dying of hunger and thirst.

874
02:01:19,200 --> 02:01:21,000
We must find another way.

875
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:24,300
You, you have no solution.

876
02:01:45,600 --> 02:01:48,900
When this type drank, he believes any permit.

877
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,500
Ms. Gracinda!

878
02:02:05,200 --> 02:02:06,500
Ms. Gracinda!

879
02:02:07,300 --> 02:02:09,900
You want a silver spoon? It is five francs.

880
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:21,900
Zinha!

881
02:02:23,300 --> 02:02:24,600
Zinha!

882
02:02:28,100 --> 02:02:30,300
You want a silver spoon? Four francs.

883
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:54,900
When we were little girls, we did it all:

884
02:03:55,200 --> 02:03:57,700
'' I want salt, I want salt. ''

885
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:00,400
And when we arrived, we had forgotten:

886
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:06,100
'' Madam, my mother would, would ...

887
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:08,300
Damn, I forgot. ''

888
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,900
And when came the Pitrolino.

889
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:20,700
And you, in your neighborhood, there was not a man passing?

890
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:23,200
He sold the oil and everything.

891
02:04:23,500 --> 02:04:28,300
It was a grocery store in a cart, it was the Pitrolino.

892
02:04:29,000 --> 02:04:32,200
I do not remember, I was too small.

893
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:38,100
- Too small ... But it always happens! - It's called the Pitrolino yet.

894
02:04:39,900 --> 02:04:41,900
Yes, it still happens.

895
02:04:42,600 --> 02:04:45,400
But it sells more oil it sells wine ...

896
02:04:46,000 --> 02:04:48,100
- And the grocery store. - From bleach.

897
02:04:50,300 --> 02:04:52,600
It brings the gas cylinders.

898
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,800
And wine to Anita.

899
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:04,800
'' Du showers, showers du, du showers ... ''

900
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:09,500
'' Madam, my mother would, would ...

901
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,300
- Want what, my dear? - I forgot.

902
02:05:12,600 --> 02:05:18,700
- Go ask him '' I returned.. '' My mother would ... I forgot again. ''

903
02:05:19,000 --> 02:05:22,600
I was always head in the air.

904
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:26,900
So for the way I repeated,

905
02:05:27,200 --> 02:05:28,700
'' You sel, you riz, you frasan,

906
02:05:29,000 --> 02:05:30,900
you sel, you riz, you frasan ... ''

907
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,900
Lord Jesus!

908
02:05:36,200 --> 02:05:38,700
Once at school,

909
02:05:40,200 --> 02:05:43,900
we played ball with a girlfriend, I liked playing ball,

910
02:05:44,600 --> 02:05:48,300
there was a barbed ground ...

911
02:05:48,600 --> 02:05:51,200
I lifted him to get the ball.

912
02:05:51,500 --> 02:05:56,400
She was right behind me, I let go, it tore him the skull!

913
02:05:58,600 --> 02:06:01,700
As she ran, I heard: trrrr.

914
02:06:04,200 --> 02:06:05,800
She always brand.

915
02:06:06,100 --> 02:06:08,500
And I: '' Paula, you're not ready to forget. ''

916
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:11,200
'' Surely not, I will always have the brand ''.

917
02:06:12,600 --> 02:06:14,400
He always came to me with this stuff!

918
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,100
And the day my godmother

919
02:06:17,400 --> 02:06:20,500
recounted his gossip

920
02:06:20,800 --> 02:06:23,700
and all of a sudden...

921
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:28,000
a stool tumbles ...

922
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:30,500
bang, right on his mouth.

923
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:32,900
Yet that does not forget.

924
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:39,200
The brand is made to remember.

925
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:44,200
It was still a nice childhood in this neighborhood.

926
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:47,400
It's sad to leave.

927
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:49,900
It hurts me.

928
02:06:50,200 --> 02:06:52,500
Of course we had a nice childhood here.

929
02:06:52,800 --> 02:06:54,700
If ever I pass by here ...

930
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:57,300
There was no dope once.

931
02:06:57,600 --> 02:06:59,900
There were but ...

932
02:07:00,200 --> 02:07:03,700
It will not see, it was not like now.

933
02:07:04,600 --> 02:07:08,100
Who would have thought ... our Geny Geny was dealing.

934
02:07:10,800 --> 02:07:14,900
Tire not it like that.

935
02:07:16,800 --> 02:07:19,000
You the Crames completely.

936
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,100
- Let me take one last puff. - You already had your turn!

937
02:07:21,400 --> 02:07:24,600
You've already shot a LOT!

938
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:27,600
It was small!

939
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:30,600
Ah yes ? And that's why the cigarette has this face there!

940
02:07:30,900 --> 02:07:33,200
- You make the burn. - No.

941
02:07:33,500 --> 02:07:37,800
Whore ! And the other burns the lips.

942
02:07:38,100 --> 02:07:39,200
Just go.

943
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:32,400
What do you want, Nhurro?

944
02:09:38,900 --> 02:09:40,800
Did not you a little bread, Zita?

945
02:09:42,300 --> 02:09:45,000
- What do you want ? - You're not a little bread, Zita?

946
02:09:52,700 --> 02:09:54,300
I have not, Nhurro.

947
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,700
Thank you Madam.

948
02:11:51,400 --> 02:11:54,700
ARTIFICIAL FLOWERS ARE PROHIBITED

949
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:14,900
I have my bag,

950
02:12:16,300 --> 02:12:17,900
two pants, a shirt.

951
02:12:20,300 --> 02:12:24,600
My old sneakers and that's it.

952
02:12:26,100 --> 02:12:32,400
You're here, that's a lot ...

953
02:12:36,800 --> 02:12:38,900
I do not sleep, I'm listening.

954
02:12:41,500 --> 02:12:42,800
It's sad, right?

955
02:12:43,100 --> 02:12:45,200
I do not know what I'll do.

956
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:47,600
That's life we ​​wanted.

957
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,200
I always helped you and I'll help you again.

958
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:58,900
I've never refused anything. We've known since we were little.

959
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:03,500
That's why ... I know it's a girl's room.

960
02:13:04,200 --> 02:13:07,400
Yes, you should not have come like this, I could have been stripped.

961
02:13:07,700 --> 02:13:08,800
That is true.

962
02:13:09,100 --> 02:13:11,000
We enter when you are told to enter.

963
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:17,900
I hit. That, my father taught me.

964
02:13:20,300 --> 02:13:23,000
If you spend no more often it is because you do not want.

965
02:13:23,300 --> 02:13:24,300
I know.

966
02:13:24,700 --> 02:13:26,700
They never told you not.

967
02:13:28,100 --> 02:13:32,000
But I do not like to stick to those who are willing to help me, you know?

968
02:13:32,300 --> 02:13:35,700
There comes a point when they say to you '! You abuses' ''

969
02:13:36,600 --> 02:13:40,500
They never told you that. Till today.

970
02:13:41,100 --> 02:13:46,000
'' It helps, it helps a little, and one day he feels at home. ''

971
02:13:47,200 --> 02:13:49,600
They never told you not. Till today.

972
02:13:49,900 --> 02:13:51,200
Tomorrow I do not know.

973
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:54,600
Every time I here it is as if I got home.

974
02:13:54,900 --> 02:13:57,700
That's why I came to ask you a shelter, a roof.

975
02:13:58,000 --> 02:14:01,100
And you know you have it. If you have not, is that you do not want.

976
02:14:02,200 --> 02:14:04,200
Here, anyone ever refused to eat.

977
02:14:05,700 --> 02:14:07,600
Neither room or a corner for rest.

978
02:14:07,900 --> 02:14:10,800
That's life we ​​wanted.

979
02:14:11,100 --> 02:14:15,300
No, this is not the life we ​​wanted, that's life we ​​are obliged to live.

980
02:14:15,600 --> 02:14:16,800
You think ?

981
02:14:17,100 --> 02:14:21,100
Yes I think. Looks like a destiny, it is drawn ...

982
02:14:22,800 --> 02:14:25,400
You were going so well. Look at you now.

983
02:14:27,900 --> 02:14:30,200
How many times I saw you go in the neighborhood,

984
02:14:30,500 --> 02:14:32,800
and how many times I said 'you go again.' '

985
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:37,400
And you '' No I get out of work. '' You see. I was right.

986
02:14:41,100 --> 02:14:44,500
No, when I walked in the neighborhood ...

987
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:50,600
it was not for dope.

988
02:14:51,100 --> 02:14:55,800
I was out of work, were placed me there.

989
02:14:56,100 --> 02:14:57,800
And you bought.

990
02:14:58,100 --> 02:15:01,400
No, I arrived penniless, I met a drug dealer, I asked him:

991
02:15:01,700 --> 02:15:04,800
'' Lend me a hundred bullets, I go out with a girl, I have not a round.

992
02:15:05,100 --> 02:15:06,800
The boss not pay me. ''

993
02:15:07,100 --> 02:15:10,700
Him instead of giving me a hundred bullets: '' Well that's two hundred. ''

994
02:15:12,400 --> 02:15:15,200
You clearly see ? And you slammed them where? In the dope.

995
02:15:18,300 --> 02:15:24,000
That, that's life we ​​chose. It's like that now.

996
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:28,300
You know as well as me. What happened to me...

997
02:15:29,600 --> 02:15:32,400
It happened to you, to me, to many others.

998
02:15:32,700 --> 02:15:34,800
Except that thou hast a mother ...

999
02:15:35,200 --> 02:15:39,500
... Who helps me a lot. But I also work hard.

1000
02:15:41,900 --> 02:15:43,800
I would do anything for her.

1001
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:48,300
Like her, there are few.

1002
02:15:52,700 --> 02:15:58,500
I too have someone like my mother.

1003
02:15:59,300 --> 02:16:01,600
A mother, it has only one, fathers were many.

1004
02:16:01,900 --> 02:16:05,300
She never refused me anything, she never had anything either ...

1005
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,700
But the little she had ...

1006
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:11,400
She gave it to you. When she could not, it was because of your father.

1007
02:16:12,700 --> 02:16:15,900
What is certain is that I avoided asking him for money.

1008
02:16:16,200 --> 02:16:20,400
I knew that with the little she had it fail him.

1009
02:16:20,700 --> 02:16:22,100
Yes.

1010
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:24,500
But I made him much harm.

1011
02:16:25,700 --> 02:16:27,400
It's destiny, I think.

1012
02:16:27,700 --> 02:16:29,800
I know she has always forgiven.

1013
02:16:30,200 --> 02:16:33,400
That's why I left, to stop hurting him.

1014
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,100
Imagine a mother who bears four like us.

1015
02:16:41,700 --> 02:16:45,300
My mother had me and already it made her mad.

1016
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:47,500
Then imagine four.

1017
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:49,400
And my mother stopped drinking.

1018
02:16:49,800 --> 02:16:51,300
You see.

1019
02:16:51,600 --> 02:16:54,400
She still suffers from a lack.

1020
02:16:54,700 --> 02:16:57,400
It's been three months since she no longer drinks.

1021
02:16:59,000 --> 02:17:01,500
And for you it is not important that?

1022
02:17:02,700 --> 02:17:04,400
Yes Yes. It is important.

1023
02:17:04,700 --> 02:17:06,700
Look where my sister and my brother.

1024
02:17:07,000 --> 02:17:09,400
Looks like we will fall, too.

1025
02:17:09,800 --> 02:17:12,400
Fall. If it was like that.

1026
02:17:15,100 --> 02:17:18,200
One day they will say, 'Enough.' '

1027
02:17:18,500 --> 02:17:20,600
They will be so worn.

1028
02:17:20,900 --> 02:17:24,400
Being out there every day is not livable.

1029
02:17:24,700 --> 02:17:27,300
And your mother will get tired.

1030
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:32,900
It can change that.

1031
02:17:34,600 --> 02:17:37,700
But I also work hard.

1032
02:17:40,600 --> 02:17:43,700
They must put in mind to slow down.

1033
02:17:44,200 --> 02:17:45,700
And win.

1034
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:49,000
There are already two there, we will not add two more, right?

1035
02:17:50,000 --> 02:17:53,200
Lift and support.

1036
02:17:54,100 --> 02:17:56,500
We did it when we were little.

1037
02:17:57,400 --> 02:17:58,800
- No ? - Yes.

1038
02:17:59,100 --> 02:18:03,100
I have over my grandmother and you want more you help your mother.

1039
02:18:07,200 --> 02:18:09,800
I'm going out. I can not hear you.

1040
02:18:10,100 --> 02:18:12,800
- But you let me stay a little here? - Yes of course.

1041
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:14,700
- Some time ? - You know I do.

1042
02:18:16,400 --> 02:18:18,000
Well ... thank you.

1043
02:18:31,400 --> 02:18:34,300
- Want to buy a mandarin? - I do not have money.

1044
02:18:35,000 --> 02:18:37,800
- Look how beautiful it is! - No, I have no money.

1045
02:18:39,200 --> 02:18:40,900
Thank you, I have no money.

1046
02:19:05,900 --> 02:19:09,900
Put it over. Range our clothes and the mom.

1047
02:20:11,200 --> 02:20:13,300
Vanda, you buy me Mandarin?

1048
02:21:25,700 --> 02:21:27,000
Vanda!

1049
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:31,600
What do you want him to Vanda?

1050
02:22:34,900 --> 02:22:37,300
Anna, you want a salad?

1051
02:22:42,700 --> 02:22:44,300
Salad or cabbage?

1052
02:22:55,600 --> 02:23:00,100
New funeral parlor Sales

1053
02:23:09,600 --> 02:23:10,800
Want cabbage?

1054
02:24:02,100 --> 02:24:04,300
Life has despised.

1055
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:18,600
I lived ghost houses that others abandoned.

1056
02:24:31,100 --> 02:24:32,900
Houses...

1057
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:39,400
where even a witch would not have wanted to stay.

1058
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:45,900
But sometimes I found a house that was worth it.

1059
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:48,500
All my houses ...

1060
02:24:52,800 --> 02:24:57,700
all households were clandestine houses.

1061
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:06,100
They were abandoned.

1062
02:25:07,900 --> 02:25:10,000
If we had been good people ...

1063
02:25:14,200 --> 02:25:15,500
Yes.

1064
02:25:18,200 --> 02:25:20,300
... they would not demolished.

1065
02:25:33,700 --> 02:25:35,700
There you go...

1066
02:25:37,700 --> 02:25:39,300
house after house.

1067
02:25:47,800 --> 02:25:50,900
I paid more for what I have not done ...

1068
02:25:52,500 --> 02:25:54,700
for what I did.

1069
02:26:33,900 --> 02:26:36,300
- They started to rehouse people? - Yes.

1070
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:38,500
Or ?

1071
02:26:38,800 --> 02:26:40,900
Where Carla lives.

1072
02:26:41,200 --> 02:26:43,300
The side Boavista?

1073
02:26:45,800 --> 02:26:47,100
My God !

1074
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:50,900
It's not so bad. All districts are not like ours.

1075
02:26:52,600 --> 02:26:55,200
And now. God knows where it will go?

1076
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,000
At the cemetery.

1077
02:28:23,500 --> 02:28:24,800
I can not anymore.

1078
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:39,800
And this door, we take it?

1079
02:31:09,700 --> 02:31:11,800
Here, Nhurro shot himself.

1080
02:31:15,900 --> 02:31:17,400
Nhurro left.

1081
02:31:48,500 --> 02:31:50,900
It was too much for him the girls' room.

1082
02:31:57,000 --> 02:31:58,800
Where I screwed up my pants?

1083
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:57,000
This room will never row!

1084
02:33:03,200 --> 02:33:04,500
It's cold ?

1085
02:33:29,500 --> 02:33:32,400
Lend me a pump, my needle is clogged.

1086
02:33:37,700 --> 02:33:39,200
I lend you a tip.

1087
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:41,000
But it is the needle is blocked.

1088
02:33:41,300 --> 02:33:43,000
Opens it.

1089
02:33:45,800 --> 02:33:47,500
Where I have a tip?

1090
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:50,200
Here !

1091
02:33:50,500 --> 02:33:53,300
Pours a little water in the mouthpiece.

1092
02:33:55,800 --> 02:33:57,400
Pour a little water, Mosquito.

1093
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:02,800
Hurry, before it coagulates.

1094
02:34:06,400 --> 02:34:10,500
Do not throw there, there is a bed

1095
02:34:10,800 --> 02:34:13,300
- Oh, you sleep here? - Unfortunately yes.

1096
02:34:21,700 --> 02:34:24,600
Mom, you go there at what time?

1097
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:29,500
At this rate, it will be the visit at four in the morning!

1098
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:33,100
- Shut up ! - You're sad.

1099
02:34:33,400 --> 02:34:36,400
You want to come with me?

1100
02:34:39,700 --> 02:34:41,700
They will not let me in.

1101
02:34:42,900 --> 02:34:45,200
Come. Just to walk.

1102
02:34:45,500 --> 02:34:47,400
And who will take care of the kid?

1103
02:34:47,700 --> 02:34:49,500
Well, rest then ...

1104
02:34:53,100 --> 02:34:54,800
For sure if he was sleeping ...

1105
02:34:57,600 --> 02:35:00,200
Miranda, if you go there, I'm there.

1106
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:03,000
What I will do at the prison?

1107
02:35:14,200 --> 02:35:15,900
Hello, hello Lena.

1108
02:35:20,500 --> 02:35:21,500
Right away.

1109
02:35:36,800 --> 02:35:39,100
I go to coffee with Dad.

1110
02:36:09,900 --> 02:36:11,700
It's fake ..

1111
02:36:12,000 --> 02:36:13,500
Draws a puff!

1112
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:15,400
Only one ?!

1113
02:36:15,700 --> 02:36:17,200
One like me, shit!

1114
02:36:17,500 --> 02:36:19,300
Do not mouth!

1115
02:36:20,100 --> 02:36:22,500
Shit ! You're going to burn everything.

1116
02:36:22,800 --> 02:36:26,900
It's my turn, on the grandmother's head.

1117
02:36:28,100 --> 02:36:29,600
Where is she ?

1118
02:36:31,700 --> 02:36:32,900
Here it is.

1119
02:36:36,800 --> 02:36:40,500
I laugh but you know that it is due to lack.

1120
02:36:47,000 --> 02:36:48,300
And you it makes you laugh?

1121
02:36:50,400 --> 02:36:52,700
No ? You're the only well.

1122
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:55,500
You're really special.

1123
02:36:56,400 --> 02:36:57,900
There is it like to laugh.

1124
02:36:58,600 --> 02:37:01,300
There are those who mourn; yea but when not.

1125
02:37:01,700 --> 02:37:04,300
And when they do, they laugh. And heartily.

1126
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:07,000
Thou hast ever cried you more than your account.

1127
02:37:07,300 --> 02:37:11,700
To cry, I cried! At the hospital, I was doing it.

1128
02:37:13,400 --> 02:37:16,400
Whore ! It was not pretty.

1129
02:37:17,800 --> 02:37:20,400
But if you are going to see, do not forget your basket.

1130
02:37:20,700 --> 02:37:21,900
What cart?

1131
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:25,000
You're so dumb! What basket, Vanda?

1132
02:37:26,300 --> 02:37:27,600
But yours.

1133
02:37:27,900 --> 02:37:29,700
- Cart? - Yes.

1134
02:37:35,200 --> 02:37:37,100
Watch out, you're gonna burn!

1135
02:37:38,300 --> 02:37:39,900
What cart?

1136
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:44,500
A basket !

1137
02:37:49,400 --> 02:37:50,700
You really are an idiot.

1138
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:52,000
The idiot is you!

1139
02:37:52,600 --> 02:37:54,500
You never heard '' If you are going to see,

1140
02:37:54,800 --> 02:37:56,800
do not forget your basket? ''

1141
02:38:02,100 --> 02:38:03,500
You saw the movie ?

1142
02:38:04,700 --> 02:38:08,700
The one where the girl out of her tits a gun like this, like that.

1143
02:38:16,300 --> 02:38:21,100
Police Academy. He went there two weeks ago.

1144
02:41:36,300 --> 02:41:38,800
- Tires-one and I finished. - Why one?

1145
02:41:39,100 --> 02:41:41,400
Because I fired one, this question!

1146
02:41:55,400 --> 02:41:56,400
