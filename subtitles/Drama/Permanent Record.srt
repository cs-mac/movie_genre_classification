00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:29,780
The twilight embraced a rare foray 
outside those kingly walls,

4
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,032
<i>Upon Lady Jeon's request to visit 
her abode in the Northern District.</i>

5
00:00:35,152 --> 00:00:38,097
<i>So turbid was the mantle of mist 
which there she found,</i>

6
00:00:38,217 --> 00:00:40,586
<i>Dread engulfed her
every single hesitant step.</i>

7
00:00:40,706 --> 00:00:47,266
<i>So sudden it was, the feeble sound 
of footsteps haunting the shadows.</i>

8
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:52,318
<i>Taken aback, 
she swiftly turned to behold,</i>

9
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:56,021
As a manly contour crept
outside the nightly haze,

10
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:00,173
<i>Her heart shivering in dread!</i>

11
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:08,649
Verging upon her was
this menacing figure...

12
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,265
Verging upon her was
this menacing figure!

13
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:23,005
<i>Let's get moving.</i>

14
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,820
Verging upon her was
this menacing figure.

15
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:28,124
<i>Piercing the nebulous brume,</i>

16
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:31,476
<i>His punishing blade beheaded Lady Jeon!</i>

17
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:38,002
Demise brewing from the darkness,
one last time she beheld,

18
00:01:38,122 --> 00:01:42,239
That man's visage and the
arcane secrets it concealed,

19
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,667
One last ominous sight before 
eternal quiet graced the night.

20
00:01:47,787 --> 00:01:49,615
<i>My, what a tragic finale!</i>

21
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:50,852
<i>Ehh...</i>

22
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,894
Everyone, stop!

23
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,309
<i>May I ask you what is the matter?</i>

24
00:02:01,429 --> 00:02:05,380
Murderer Oh Suntak, submit immediately.

JOSEON X-Files: Secret Book
- Episode 5: The Sealed Tale -

26
00:02:16,038 --> 00:02:17,310
<i>Believe me.</i>

27
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,310
All I did was narrating
right as it was written.

28
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,300
Every single thing you said
matches yesterday's murder.

29
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,396
Why did you slay that court lady?

30
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:29,318
I mean, if I truly
was behind that murder,

31
00:02:29,438 --> 00:02:31,932
why would I boast of such a 
heinous crime in everyone's presence?

32
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,787
Perhaps it is mere 
vainglory on your part,

33
00:02:33,907 --> 00:02:37,136
or else you and the actual murderer
might be conspiring together.

34
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:39,085
But it doesn't merely stop at this,

35
00:02:39,205 --> 00:02:43,850
as three recent murders in the capital
perfectly match tales you recounted!

36
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,437
Officer Choi,
let's tame all that ferment.

37
00:02:47,557 --> 00:02:50,010
Isn't there a possibility that
what he claims could be the truth?

38
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,154
But, still...

39
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:54,139
And you don't even have any tangible 
evidence proving his culpability.

40
00:02:54,259 --> 00:02:57,245
Yet, despite the lack of evidence,

41
00:02:57,365 --> 00:03:02,487
all the clues at our disposal inevitably 
discredit your claims of innocence.

42
00:03:02,607 --> 00:03:04,868
Are you perchance aware that
anyone murdering a court official...

43
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:08,254
is sentenced to 
death by dismemberment?

44
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,471
Actually,

45
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:18,152
there is someone who
provides me with such tales.

46
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,182
And who would that be?

47
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:23,672
I am neither aware of his
name nor where he might live.

48
00:03:23,792 --> 00:03:25,336
How did you two meet?

49
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,212
He one day came looking for me,

50
00:03:28,332 --> 00:03:29,990
allowed me to peruse his tales,

51
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,985
and told me I could use them
if I found them to my liking.

52
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:34,490
<i>He displayed remarkable prose and 
his tales were deeply intriguing,</i>

53
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,495
so I thought he might have been a 
scholar with a predilection for narrative.

54
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:40,665
Not to mention that he
asked for no remuneration, so...

55
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:41,809
So?

56
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:46,216
We meet twice per month,
during every full and new moon.

57
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,250
<i>I do not know his name,</i>

58
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,250
and after leaving his tales behind,
he disappears right as he came.

59
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,012
I never imagined the tales he
narrates were real occurrences.

60
00:03:55,121 --> 00:03:57,363
<i>You said you meet every full moon?</i>

61
00:04:04,074 --> 00:04:06,069
Aigoo... Come on in!

62
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:12,378
<i>What is with all these
stories to tell, these days?!</i>

63
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:15,960
This is the latest one.

64
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,585
Yesterday in Ayeong-Gol,

65
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,379
a Royal Court lady was murdered.

66
00:04:19,499 --> 00:04:23,570
But what's peculiar is that there
were no traces of violation or burglary.

67
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:27,191
Not to mention that
she was even beheaded!

68
00:04:27,346 --> 00:04:30,249
That would more than suffice.

69
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:36,835
But, tell me.

70
00:04:36,955 --> 00:04:40,855
Why not write a short story, 
while you're at it?

71
00:04:40,975 --> 00:04:44,025
I will generously compensate you.

72
00:04:44,145 --> 00:04:45,769
No interest?

73
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:51,061
<i>{\a6}*of a noble and commoner,
usually clan servants or gisaeng</i>

74
00:04:47,072 --> 00:04:51,061
Your prose is to be lauded,
but you remain an illegitimate son*,

75
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:53,984
<i>so any court aspirations
would be rather far-fetched.</i>

76
00:04:54,104 --> 00:04:56,781
What are you going to do
with all that talent, anyhow?

77
00:04:56,901 --> 00:04:57,910
<i>Why?</i>

78
00:04:58,853 --> 00:05:01,482
Importuned by what I said?

79
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:05,487
Shall I let you in on something?

80
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,569
What?

81
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:11,843
Next year, on the first day of the
fifth month at the hour of the ram (1-3pm),

82
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:15,404
<i>{\a6}*by the Han River</i>

83
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:15,404
you will ride a boat
headed for Gwang Port*.

84
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,491
I see a yellow flag
fluttering in the wind,

85
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:27,656
while someone carrying a huge load
comes on board in haste.

86
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:32,204
That happens exactly
as you are boarding the boat.

87
00:05:35,214 --> 00:05:38,534
Hit by wayfarers passing by,

88
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,962
you lose your balance,

89
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:44,272
and end up thrown right under the ship,

90
00:05:46,545 --> 00:05:50,569
where a big stone 
covered by ropes is lying.

91
00:05:51,714 --> 00:05:54,776
You will hit your head on 
the stone and meet your demise.

92
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:55,966
What?!

93
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:01,061
You little...

94
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,628
What did you just say?

95
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:04,958
You little bastard...

96
00:06:05,078 --> 00:06:09,511
How dare you belittle me
with such palaver!

97
00:06:14,176 --> 00:06:16,494
You insolent son of a wench!

98
00:06:17,517 --> 00:06:18,568
You insolent,

99
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:21,162
shameless son of a wench!

100
00:06:21,282 --> 00:06:24,100
How dare you?

101
00:06:36,994 --> 00:06:38,618
Aigoo, really...

102
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:59,668
I wonder If we should
have even bothered.

103
00:06:59,788 --> 00:07:01,091
What are you referring to?

104
00:07:01,211 --> 00:07:03,086
Getting involved in this case, that is.

105
00:07:03,206 --> 00:07:06,055
He's being watched,
so he won't get away easily.

106
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,539
I didn't mean that...

107
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:10,473
I'm just saying, murders are for
the capital bureau to worry about,

108
00:07:10,593 --> 00:07:13,813
but if we interfere and
something happens, then what?

109
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,353
Don't tell me...

110
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:19,144
Are we suddenly feeling scared?!

111
00:07:19,396 --> 00:07:21,085
It's not that...

112
00:07:21,205 --> 00:07:24,657
I just feel that we might have gotten
involved in something bigger than we think.

113
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,497
Why complicate things?

114
00:07:26,617 --> 00:07:31,258
All we need to find out is why that
murderer would flaunt his crimes.

115
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:36,037
By the way, there is
a book I must peruse,

116
00:07:36,157 --> 00:07:38,155
so I will spend some time 
immersed in lectures,

117
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:40,166
just so you know.

118
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,678
What?

119
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,419
No!

120
00:10:01,008 --> 00:10:02,358
Oh Gyeonghoon!

121
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,678
<i>Stop there!</i>

122
00:10:09,714 --> 00:10:11,214
What's wrong with you?

123
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,410
<i>Naeuri!</i>

124
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,460
<i>{\a6}*in Korean shamanism, an intercessor
between humans and gods</i>

125
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:06,460
<i>A male mudang* is running
away in great haste,</i>

126
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:09,831
As a man on his trail, sickle in hand,

127
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,688
Pierces his back with great fervor,

128
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:16,616
As howls of fear 
are drenching the streets.

129
00:11:16,736 --> 00:11:18,932
The prose is so accurate,

130
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:23,277
it feels almost as if he
jotted it down right as it happened.

131
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,857
How did he know something
like that would happen?

132
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:29,558
<i>He's a mudang, all right.
No doubt.</i>

133
00:11:29,678 --> 00:11:31,708
I know from experience,
since my mother was one...

134
00:11:31,828 --> 00:11:34,723
Then, why could he not predict 
we would be on his trail?

135
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,997
That was likely...

136
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:42,678
not part of his vision.

137
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:44,131
Listen, he's a mudang.

138
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,760
Even my mother only chooses
to see whatever she wants to.

139
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,915
<i>Wow... This is really...
quite something, isn't it?</i>

140
00:11:50,035 --> 00:11:51,740
<i>Wow... Mudang.</i>

141
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:53,441
- Magistrate Jang!
- Uh?

142
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:56,131
You didn't happen
to see my tablet, did you?

143
00:11:56,827 --> 00:11:57,941
Tablet?!

144
00:12:27,471 --> 00:12:30,380
Nah... Never mind.

145
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,823
<i>Did the damned tablet 
fly away or something?</i>

146
00:12:32,943 --> 00:12:35,683
<i>Now that's peculiar.</i>

147
00:12:37,818 --> 00:12:40,626
I guess the capital bureau released him.

148
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:51,875
Ahh... You said the tablet
would be around here!

149
00:13:12,108 --> 00:13:13,301
Is anything the matter?

150
00:13:13,421 --> 00:13:15,079
Uh?! Is ever...

151
00:13:15,852 --> 00:13:17,739

00:13:31,204 --> 00:13:32,596
Hyung...

159
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,333
Let's go in.

160
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:48,630
Hyung!

161
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,194
<i>- Come out at once!
- What's wrong with you people?</i>

162
00:14:06,206 --> 00:14:08,854
Are you all right?

163
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:20,151
My...

164
00:14:20,271 --> 00:14:22,595
brother...

165
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,074
- My brother...
- Listen!

166
00:14:26,816 --> 00:14:28,394
This...

167
00:14:28,514 --> 00:14:30,360
"A blade is pointing..."

168
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,479
"at Inspector Kim's pate."

169
00:14:32,599 --> 00:14:34,365
<i>Then, this...</i>

170
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:36,638
Hyeongdo!

171
00:14:37,489 --> 00:14:38,819
Hyeongdo!

172
00:15:01,419 --> 00:15:02,718
Stop there!

173
00:15:47,657 --> 00:15:48,925
<i>The Office?!</i>

174
00:15:53,551 --> 00:15:56,969
Why would an Office inspector
be on that man's trail?

175
00:16:05,393 --> 00:16:08,130
Judging by your garments
we seem to be fellow officials,

176
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,960
so may I ask you 
the very same question?

177
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,393
Unless you want
to face an early demise,

178
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,797
I suggest you leave that man alone.

179
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:17,941
What?

180
00:16:33,782 --> 00:16:37,746
Wow... If it weren't for this book,
you'd be on a trip to the Hades by now.

181
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:42,679
How did you know you'd be stabbed,
wearing this book on your belly?

182
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:46,495
Then, the man writing those tales 
was your half-brother?

183
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,211
That's right.

184
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:52,808
Ever since the age of seven,
he endured all struggles known to man.

185
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,185
And your parents?

186
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:57,293
A chronic disease took away our father,

187
00:16:57,413 --> 00:17:01,066
<i>while my brother's mother
suddenly left our abode one day.</i>

188
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,531
From that day onwards,

189
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:06,959
I've been raising him like a father...

190
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,727
So the same man who raised 
his brother like a father...

191
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:12,155
was conspiring to hand him 
to the authorities?

192
00:17:12,275 --> 00:17:13,500
It's not that...

193
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:16,898
My brother...
is not like everyone else.

194
00:17:17,593 --> 00:17:19,186
<i>One day,</i>

195
00:17:19,306 --> 00:17:22,465
he suddenly started
claiming he was seeing things,

196
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:25,371
and that they'd ravage his mind
if he didn't write about them.

197
00:17:25,491 --> 00:17:27,861
At first, I thought it
was only a fleeting condition...

198
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:28,959
But then?

199
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,083
Not long ago, he started suggesting 
someone was on his trail.

200
00:17:32,203 --> 00:17:33,567
Those men we saw earlier?

201
00:17:33,687 --> 00:17:37,417
My brother would never be 
capable of committing murder.

202
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,211
I know that.

203
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:42,381
All I was curious about was 
how your brother could manage...

204
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:46,676
to record in such glaring detail
events which have not yet occurred.

205
00:17:46,796 --> 00:17:50,635
His mother was a mudang.

206
00:17:50,755 --> 00:17:52,874
So you're suggesting he might
have inherited her same attributes?

207
00:17:52,994 --> 00:17:55,348
- It is the only logical...
- Give me a break.

208
00:17:55,468 --> 00:17:58,069
Then, it should be the same for
everyone who had mudang parents.

209
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:00,482
<i>Why isn't it working for me?</i>

210
00:18:01,895 --> 00:18:03,441
But, what is this book about?

211
00:18:03,561 --> 00:18:05,189
<i>I can't say, either.</i>

212
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:07,076
He told me to take good care of it,

213
00:18:07,196 --> 00:18:12,738
and the moment he had me conceal it
beneath my vestments, those men came in.

214
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,527
This is sealed.

215
00:18:16,647 --> 00:18:18,753
Is that one of his...

216
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:21,413
It is likely one of his tales.

217
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,589
<i>(Left) Mudang Baekyi's Love 
(Right) Book of Prophecies</i>

218
00:18:43,784 --> 00:18:46,320
<i>Mudang Baekyi graced us
with the following prophecies...</i>

219
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,145
<i>on the impending destiny
of our state matters.</i>

220
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:50,155
<i>In the fifteenth year
of Gwanghae's reign (1623),</i>

221
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:54,820
<i>{\a6}*one of the major political factions of
mid-Joseon; pro-Ming and anti-Manchu (Qing)</i>

222
00:18:50,275 --> 00:18:54,820
<i>the Westerners* will begin a restoration to
protest against the king's lack of virtue,</i>

223
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:59,459
<i>dethroning him, and helping the
grandson of the late King Seonjo,</i>

224
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,088
<i>{\a6}*to be King Injo</i>

225
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:02,088
<i>Prince Neungyang*, to the throne.</i>

226
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,230
<i>- Book of Prophecies -</i>

227
00:20:26,981 --> 00:20:28,280
Naeuri.

228
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,553
Have a look at these.

229
00:20:30,673 --> 00:20:33,872
They're records of people claiming
to have foreshadowed the future.

230
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,635
Why, anything of note in there?

231
00:20:36,755 --> 00:20:39,991
But, is anything the matter?

232
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,651
Ahh... It's nothing.

233
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:45,246
No, I'm sure something is up.

234
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,932
I said it's nothing.

235
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:48,679
Everything is fine.

236
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,040
I spent the night immersed in
lectures, so I could not sleep.

237
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:57,907
Take a look at this.

238
00:20:58,912 --> 00:21:03,953
The latest is about a mudang named Baekyi 
who was recently ousted from the palace.

239
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,508
Baekyi?!

240
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,580
<i>She read all the
court attendants' fortune,</i>

241
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,451
and everything she claimed was true.

242
00:21:09,571 --> 00:21:11,987
- As a result...
- So nothing of note, you're saying.

243
00:21:12,107 --> 00:21:15,571
Isn't overwhelming people with
vague chicanery what they're best at?

244
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,700
After which people interpret that as 
their own situation and experience shock.

245
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,896
- But this is not your usual...
- Never you mind.

246
00:21:22,016 --> 00:21:24,700
No need to concern ourselves
with a mudang's vicissitudes.

247
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,339
<i>Ahh, also.</i>

248
00:21:26,772 --> 00:21:28,829
This...

249
00:21:32,123 --> 00:21:33,397
Have you read this?

250
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,253
It's just a book of tales, 
as we expected.

251
00:21:35,373 --> 00:21:36,706
<i>Hardly out of the ordinary.</i>

252
00:21:36,826 --> 00:21:41,121
Nothing more than vulgar tripe
narrating of lascivious encounters.

253
00:21:49,096 --> 00:21:51,647
<i>Here... 
You may choose your brushes now.</i>

254
00:22:00,329 --> 00:22:05,277
<i>The Westerners will begin a restoration to
protest against the king's lack of virtue,</i>

255
00:22:05,397 --> 00:22:10,488
<i>dethroning him, and helping the
grandson of the late King Seonjo,</i>

256
00:22:10,608 --> 00:22:13,397
<i>Prince Neungyang, to the throne.</i>

257
00:22:20,661 --> 00:22:21,667
Hyung!

258
00:22:21,787 --> 00:22:22,734
Gyeonghoon!

259
00:22:22,854 --> 00:22:25,424
Gyeonghoon... Gyeonghoon!

260
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:29,107
Gyeonghoon? Are you all right?

261
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,453
Is everything fine?

262
00:22:30,573 --> 00:22:31,906
Yes, Hyung...

263
00:22:32,026 --> 00:22:34,473
And... And nobody was trailing you.

264
00:22:34,593 --> 00:22:35,741
Hyung.

265
00:22:35,861 --> 00:22:38,614
For the time being,
I think I should leave the capital.

266
00:22:39,402 --> 00:22:41,969
Hyung, that book I entrusted...

267
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,139
Did that Office inspector...

268
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:53,768
He asked me to give you
this letter, in case I met you.

269
00:22:55,979 --> 00:22:57,199
<i>Gyeonghoon...</i>

270
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,189
What on earth is happening?

271
00:23:03,353 --> 00:23:04,621
Hyung.

272
00:23:06,515 --> 00:23:08,061
Take care.

273
00:23:08,696 --> 00:23:09,994
So long.

274
00:23:23,948 --> 00:23:25,921
Hyung... Run!

275
00:24:20,104 --> 00:24:20,891
Hyung!

276
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:27,316
- Hyung...
- Gyeonghoon, get out of here, now!

277
00:24:27,436 --> 00:24:28,924
No... You must come with me!

278
00:24:29,044 --> 00:24:30,238
I said go!

279
00:24:30,358 --> 00:24:32,059
- Now!
- Hyung!

280
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:34,286
- Hyung!
- Out of the way.

281
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:35,399
<i>Hyung!!</i>

282
00:24:36,095 --> 00:24:37,713
I said move!

283
00:24:38,493 --> 00:24:40,086
Hyung!

284
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:46,240
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

285
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:49,239
Hyung...

286
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,575
- Move!
- Hyung...

287
00:25:44,076 --> 00:25:45,777
What brings you here?

288
00:25:45,897 --> 00:25:49,210
I am Kim Hyeongdo from
the Office of Inspector-General.

289
00:26:41,077 --> 00:26:42,376
Father.

290
00:26:43,969 --> 00:26:45,061
Father...

291
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,597
Father.

292
00:26:52,004 --> 00:26:53,999
<i>I read that book of yours.</i>

293
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,586
<i>I trust you're well aware of what
nefarious consequences would...</i>

294
00:26:57,706 --> 00:26:59,407
<i>befall the court,
if its content was revealed.</i>

295
00:26:59,527 --> 00:27:02,067
<i>I suggest you keep it secret
and leave Hanyang immediately.</i>

296
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:06,335
<i>{\a6}*gisaeng parlor</i>

297
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:06,335
<i>You will find a gibang* named

298
00:27:06,455 --> 00:27:09,177
<i>so head there and tell them I sent you.</i>

299
00:27:09,297 --> 00:27:12,160
<i>They will let you know
where you can find refuge.</i>

300
00:27:22,927 --> 00:27:24,102
<i>And where is the body?</i>

301
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:25,293
<i>Over there.</i>

302
00:27:33,266 --> 00:27:36,736
What is going on here?

303
00:27:37,101 --> 00:27:38,523
Where is the inspector?

304
00:27:38,643 --> 00:27:43,240
Ahh... He's been prancing about 
all day long... I have no idea.

305
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,782
Go find him right away.

306
00:27:45,902 --> 00:27:48,225
I need to go somewhere.

307
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:02,172
<i>As the gibang is sweltered
by a crimson tide,</i>

308

<i>Vice Minister of Personnel Choi
Geunyoung's lifeless body is found.</i>

309

<i>A ghastly shadow of
dread haunts all bystanders,</i>

310
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:14,347
<i>While Inspector Kim Hyeongdo
beholds this all, blade in hand.</i>

311
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,188
It is not as an Office
inspector that I ask you,

312
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,953
but as a loyal subject with 
the court's interests at heart.

313
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:27,294
I have no intention of bringing
personal fallacies to your attention,

314
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,938
so may you answer my
inquiries with utmost sincerity.

315
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:31,898
What you said is right.

316
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:36,816
I did indeed share an intimate
liaison with Court Lady Baekyi.

317
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:39,089
Then, Oh Gyeonghoon...

318
00:28:39,878 --> 00:28:41,653
must be your son as well.

319
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:45,395
It brings shame to my noble legacy.

320
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,900
Baekyi was accused of being possessed,

321
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,479
as a result of which she
was ousted from the palace.

322
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,066
I thus suppose that your illicit
relationship with her...

323
00:28:54,186 --> 00:28:56,865
stopped you from 
being of any help to her.

324
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:00,460
But why did you resort to killing her?

325
00:29:01,219 --> 00:29:03,053
What...

326
00:29:03,173 --> 00:29:04,352
is that supposed to mean?

327
00:29:04,472 --> 00:29:06,888
A certain Court Lady Jeon from His Majesty's
quarters was recently found dead,

328
00:29:07,008 --> 00:29:10,733
not to mention the body of a palace
eunuch we discovered before that.

329
00:29:10,853 --> 00:29:14,537
The other day, a male mudang...

330
00:29:14,657 --> 00:29:17,442
entrusted with Baekyi's possession
ritual was murdered at the market.

331
00:29:17,777 --> 00:29:22,587
All those murders were related 
to Your Excellency's lover, Baekyi.

332
00:29:22,707 --> 00:29:25,216
There... There is no way...

333
00:29:25,336 --> 00:29:28,396
Are you suggesting
you weren't responsible?

334
00:29:31,212 --> 00:29:33,037
What do I owe your visit to?

335
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:34,661
I'd like to ask you something.

336
00:29:34,781 --> 00:29:38,931
Do you perchance know anything about
His Excellency the Vice Minister Choi Geunyoung?

337
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:40,523
Vice Minister Choi Geunyoung?

338
00:29:40,643 --> 00:29:45,194
Someone foreshadowing the future
suggests he might be involved with this.

339
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:51,688
<i>{\a6}*Wa (Japan) invasion 
of Joseon (1592-1598)</i>

340
00:29:48,812 --> 00:29:51,688
It's a record regarding the Imjin War*.

341
00:29:51,808 --> 00:29:52,848
Why this...

342
00:29:52,968 --> 00:29:56,776
It was written no less than
two years before the Imjin year (1592).

343
00:29:56,896 --> 00:30:00,039
A mudang known as Baekyi wrote it.

344
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,302
<i>She predicted the endless misery
the Wa invasion would bring us.</i>

345
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:08,359
She was then ousted from the palace 
because of her prophecies,

346
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:11,369
<i>but people lost all traces of her 
right before the Imjin year.</i>

347
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:13,426
Everyone believed her dead.

348
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:15,065
However,

349
00:30:15,185 --> 00:30:18,575
someone claims to
have recently seen her.

350
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:21,469
And what would that have
to do with Vice Minister Choi?

351
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:25,738
He and that mudang were
engaged in an illicit liaison.

352
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,846
I see.

353
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:33,184
If you'll excuse me, I'll get going.

354
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:36,339
<i>Perchance...</i>

355
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:38,550
Yes.

356
00:30:39,478 --> 00:30:44,471
Did you find any kind of book on him?

357
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:51,361
It was nothing more than
a vulgar tale of illicit affairs.

358
00:30:52,104 --> 00:30:53,851
Nothing else?

359
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:56,511
<i>As it stands.</i>

360
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:10,668
My best wishes, Your Excellency.

361
00:31:10,788 --> 00:31:12,183
My gratitude.

362
00:31:12,879 --> 00:31:14,920
Should you ever meet again,

363
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:18,326
convey my deep concerns to him.

364
00:31:18,446 --> 00:31:20,846
Yes, certainly.

365
00:31:21,217 --> 00:31:26,181
In truth, meeting him even once 
would be of great comfort.

366
00:31:27,795 --> 00:31:30,975
<i>Do you really mean that?</i>

367
00:31:31,784 --> 00:31:34,119
Do you know where he might be?

368
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:37,698
- I can't speak with certainty, but...
- Never you mind.

369
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,345
I don't believe
that would even be necessary.

370
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:43,608
There is nothing I
have given him as his father,

371
00:31:43,728 --> 00:31:48,819
so wishing to meet him only now
would be all the more selfish on my part.

372
00:31:49,205 --> 00:31:51,723
If you'll excuse me.

373
00:32:27,939 --> 00:32:30,273
May I ask you what brings you here?

374
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,051
<i>That Office inspector...</i>

375
00:32:32,793 --> 00:32:34,262
Please...

376
00:33:35,362 --> 00:33:36,692
<i>Aww... My legs...</i>

377
00:33:36,812 --> 00:33:38,702
And the inspector?

378
00:33:39,243 --> 00:33:41,486
Where on earth...

379
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:45,416
I looked everywhere,
but no trace of him?!

380
00:33:45,758 --> 00:33:49,608
Then, any gibang he might frequent...

381
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,758
Aigoo...

382
00:33:52,716 --> 00:33:56,381
That is surely not the
Kim Hyeongdo I know.

383
00:33:56,501 --> 00:34:00,432
When it comes to judging character,
I'm as gifted as my mother.

384
00:34:00,552 --> 00:34:03,945
You'll never see Inspector Kim 
frequenting any such place.

385
00:34:04,065 --> 00:34:08,491
Put a little powder on, and
he'll explode with nosebleeds...

386
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:12,046
All right, then.

387
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,764
Will you look for him one last time?

388
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:39,274
You haven't changed at all.

389
00:34:39,394 --> 00:34:42,320
Thank you for coming to my aid.

390
00:34:43,156 --> 00:34:44,176
But...

391
00:34:44,656 --> 00:34:46,371
That fellow...

392
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:49,371
He fell asleep just now.

393
00:34:49,491 --> 00:34:52,432
How have you been faring?

394
00:34:52,552 --> 00:34:55,258
Did he come in alone?

395
00:34:55,378 --> 00:34:57,047
Yes.

396
00:34:57,928 --> 00:35:00,341
Those garments are all worn out...

397
00:35:00,461 --> 00:35:03,093
- I can get you new ones right away...
- No need.

398
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:07,258
There is somewhere I must urgently go.

399
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:41,132
<i>As the gibang is sweltered
by a crimson tide...</i>

400
00:35:41,252 --> 00:35:45,632
<i>Inspector Kim Hyeongdo
beholds this all, blade in hand.</i>

401
00:35:48,258 --> 00:35:50,794
You're still here?

402
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:01,733
What is the matter?

403
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,929
Just thought I smelled a
gisaeng's powder on you...

404
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:04,903
What?!

405
00:36:06,233 --> 00:36:08,336
What is that supposed to mean?

406
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:11,034
I wonder, what do we owe 
this sudden departure to,

407
00:36:11,154 --> 00:36:14,173
leaving work behind
as if in a lovelorn frenzy?

408
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:15,271
That, well...

409
00:36:15,391 --> 00:36:18,224
I had my reasons, don't you mind.

410
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,458
Can I serve you a cup of tea?

411
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,345
Here.

412
00:36:52,441 --> 00:36:53,678
A gibang, you said?

413
00:36:53,798 --> 00:36:54,823
Indeed.

414
00:36:54,943 --> 00:36:56,957
You could have dealt 
with it right away, then.

415
00:36:57,077 --> 00:37:00,281
- Why come to me?
- That Office inspector was with him.

416
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:03,169
When our nation's stability is at stake,

417
00:37:03,289 --> 00:37:05,890
you show qualms about disposing
a mere Office inspector?

418
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:10,452
- However, as a court official...
- Indeed.

419
00:37:11,256 --> 00:37:14,058
Aren't you a State Tribunal inspector?

420
00:37:14,178 --> 00:37:17,089
Whatever the case,
you must get this done.

421
00:37:17,209 --> 00:37:21,094
Get rid of those people
and bring me that book.

422
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:23,985
What are you waiting for?

423
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:25,794
All right.

424
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:28,949
Wait.

425
00:37:29,552 --> 00:37:32,290
Gwangtong Bridge, you said?

426
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:05,281
His Excellency left in utmost urgency.

427
00:38:05,401 --> 00:38:07,972
Did he mention where he was headed?

428
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:12,394
I did seem to hear near
Gwangtong Bridge, if I'm not mistaken...

429
00:38:12,673 --> 00:38:14,698
Thank you.

430
00:38:15,775 --> 00:38:20,723
You could say I help deal with any
quandaries of his, emotional or not.

431
00:38:33,142 --> 00:38:37,635
Is there anything on my face?

432
00:38:39,027 --> 00:38:40,017
Why...

433
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:44,208
can't you confess your feelings to him?

434
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,192
He is...

435
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:21,873
<i>Aigoo... He's nowhere, no traces, none.</i>

436
00:39:22,986 --> 00:39:26,434
He's not... Ahh... 
And what... What is this?

437
00:39:26,554 --> 00:39:28,509
Stop staring and just unclasp me.

438
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:31,833
Ahh... Yes... But who... 
Why... Who did this?

439
00:39:31,953 --> 00:39:33,457
Can we just do this, please?

440
00:39:33,577 --> 00:39:36,405
- Was Assistant Heo responsible?
- Or else who, me?

441
00:39:36,525 --> 00:39:40,179
Ahh... Enough with this and just unclasp me!
That blade over there must have a use!

442
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:41,818
Yes... Yes.

443
00:39:41,938 --> 00:39:43,596
Where did you hide that book?

444
00:39:43,716 --> 00:39:45,139
I see...

445
00:39:46,113 --> 00:39:47,722
I will be forced
to face the same destiny.

446
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:49,314
I thought I asked you something.

447
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:52,144
Did your relationship with
a mudang bring you such shame?

448
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,273
Silence!

449
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:55,593
And what would you possibly know?

450
00:39:55,713 --> 00:39:58,268
- Give me that book at once.
- No.

451
00:39:59,165 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm afraid I cannot.

452
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,547
You knave...

453
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:03,152
Do you even realize what kind 
of book we're dealing with?

454
00:40:03,272 --> 00:40:04,543
Naturally.

455
00:40:04,663 --> 00:40:05,981
I do.

456
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:07,528
<i>And do you think it ends at that?</i>

457
00:40:07,648 --> 00:40:10,373
I could easily write such a book myself!

458
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:11,641
<i>Shall I prove my claims?</i>

459
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:13,619
Shall I tell you what future
awaits our nation?

460
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:15,134
Shut your gob!

461
00:40:15,254 --> 00:40:17,778
What kind of palaver is that?

462
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:26,503
Merely because noble blood 
graces your veins,

463
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:29,209
you had no qualms about forsaking 
your own flesh and blood!

464
00:40:29,329 --> 00:40:32,255
But now that I might
expose your nefarious conduct,

465
00:40:32,375 --> 00:40:33,779
you're eager to rid yourself of me?

466
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,449
I said speak no more!

467
00:40:39,449 --> 00:40:43,567
One single utterance, and I shall
extirpate that viperous tongue of yours.

468
00:40:43,687 --> 00:40:46,149
For am I nothing but a
lowly mudang's offspring,

469
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:49,420
why stop at that, when you 
could easily cut off my hands?

470
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,776
No... Why not dismember me?!

471
00:40:53,642 --> 00:40:57,508
- You knave, I ought to...
- Shall we put an end to this?

472
00:40:58,592 --> 00:41:00,463
Vice Minister Choi Geunyoung.

473
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:07,654
I trust you're all aware of
what book is in my hands?!

474
00:41:07,774 --> 00:41:11,146
I might not be aware of why you're
so frantically looking for this,

475
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:14,362
but if it's something
the world cannot learn of,

476
00:41:14,482 --> 00:41:17,872
wouldn't burning it in
your presence solve all this?

477
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:21,635
Magistrate Jang!

478
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:30,494
Your Excellency has been deceived.

479
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:36,648
You might have been trying to erase any 
evidence of your illicit liaison with Baekyi,

480
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,807
but that is not what 
these people were after.

481
00:41:52,358 --> 00:41:54,198
Don't... Stay away...

482
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:56,301
I'm going to set it on fire!

483
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,430
<i>Stop there!</i>

484
00:42:31,085 --> 00:42:34,050
I will not hesitate to slay him.

485
00:42:58,638 --> 00:42:59,828
Father...

486
00:42:59,948 --> 00:43:01,065
Father...

487
00:43:05,689 --> 00:43:07,343
Father!

488
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:10,111
Father!

489
00:43:11,441 --> 00:43:13,312
Father...

490
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,521
Father...

491
00:43:22,047 --> 00:43:23,872
<i>Father...</i>

492
00:43:51,379 --> 00:43:54,549
Mudang Baekyi's Love...

493
00:43:55,694 --> 00:43:57,240
Assistant Heo, Magistrate Jang.

494
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:00,874
Oh Gyeonghoon has finally
completed his first novel.

495
00:44:01,818 --> 00:44:04,276
But what's with the flowers?

496
00:44:04,756 --> 00:44:05,890
Naeuri...

497
00:44:08,766 --> 00:44:09,879
<i>Here.</i>

498
00:44:10,761 --> 00:44:11,998
And what is this?

499
00:44:12,118 --> 00:44:13,591
From Buok.

500
00:44:19,021 --> 00:44:21,619
And he would never frequent a gibang...

501
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:26,212
I didn't think 
you'd be capable of that...

502
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:28,806
<i>Looks like I was wrong.</i>

503
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,732

I feel ashamed to just mention it,
but meseems ghosts haunt my abode.

509
00:45:01,334 --> 00:45:04,222
Don't tell me you
believe in such superstition...

510
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:05,505
Quite interesting, indeed.

511
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:08,644
<i>I just went in, 
and suddenly felt this presence...</i>

512
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:11,954
<i>But His Excellency was never caught.</i>

513
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:14,794
<i>Then, was it that Goryeo ghost?</i>

514
00:45:21,174 --> 00:45:25,389
His Excellency can't be behind this.

515
00:45:26,256 --> 00:45:30,014
And who would be behind that, then?

516
00:45:30,134 --> 00:45:34,241
What were you planning to do, 
once everyone left?

517
00:45:34,361 --> 00:45:37,612
<i>Is this presence 
evoking those phenomena,</i>

518
00:45:37,732 --> 00:45:42,499
<i>or are those events only
happening during such phenomena?</i>

519
00:45:42,619 --> 00:45:44,806
What kind of place is this?

520
00:45:44,926 --> 00:45:46,584
<i>I suggest you leave.</i>

521
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:47,883
