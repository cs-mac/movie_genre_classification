I know I should've told you.

Mac, you wouldn't listen,
okay, and I had to do something,

87
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,961

- Yeah, before talking to me!

is that you're out there doing something.

have to end somebody's life, okay?

161
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,165
How's the housing market?

162
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,930
Did you bug my house or something?

163
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,401
No, but I got a subscription to the newspaper.

Why does your wife wanna sell

165
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,685
a lovely home like this
all of a sudden, anyway?

which we are,

167
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,202
and I'm having trouble
finding a job, which I am.

168
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,370
8,500 seems like a good price point.

She doesn't know anything, all right?

170

You keep saying that.

171
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,284
All she needs to know is that

172
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,601
it's in everyone's best interest
to keep her mouth shut.

and I need my best and my brightest.

- Get what?

- His diary.
- No, that's a song book, my friend.

up in that bullshit, Verne.

She's not putting me up to anything, Verne.

is not the goddamn issue.

So I'm not supposed to give a damn

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,845
that Conway probably murdered my friend?

218

I mean, do you actually know what they were
accused of doing in Quan Thang?

It's the very worst in this war.

you can't judge a man who has.

may have done some bad shit over there.

it's not a system that exists anymore.

318
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,091
You've presented the problem well.

319
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,401
Now, what's the solution?

320
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,966
Why deal with a bunch
of low rent gun runners

321
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,328
when you can deal
directly with someone you know and trust?

322
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,570
Yours truly.

323
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,409
I'm confused.

324
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,807
Isn't that what I do already?

325
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,807
I'm saying, I stop working for you taking jobs.

326
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,445
Okay? That's over.

327
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,648
And I move over
to providing you and the network

328
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,688
with all its firearm needs.

329
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,450
You cut out any middle man.

330
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,683
- Because you're my middle man.
- Exactly!

331
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,125
Where?

332
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,406
What?

333
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,482
Where are you getting the guns?

334
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,840
BUDDY: Where am I getting guns?

335
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,400
You think I don't know where to get guns?

336
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,965
Come on.

337
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
So, what do you think?

338
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,568
I'm impressed, Buddy.

339
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,971
I'm impressed.

340
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,088
Very well thought out.

341
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,850
Compellingly presented.

342
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,366
The stock we got from Joe Don is dwindling.

343
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,762
I got a lead that could see us
flush through the new year.

344
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,724
Now is not the time.

345
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,004
Of course it's the time.

346
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,889
- We... We...
- THE BROKER: Buddy, I'm counting on you

347
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,361
to do what you do so well,
and that ain't running guns.

348
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,283
But things aren't the same as...

349
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,569
Now, when the dust settles,

350
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,120
we can come back around to this.

351
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:17,331
Now, you hold onto this wonderful artwork
and we'll talk.

352
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,885
Buddy, you're an absolute treasure to me,
you know that?

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,367
And I take care of you, do I not?

354
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,761
Hmm?

355
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,611
You're sure?
I wouldn't want you to feel ill-used.

356
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:44,402
- No, I don't. I...
- I'm glad to hear it. I'm glad to hear it.

357
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,881
'Cause some individuals

358
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,522
might mistake your enthusiasm

359
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,364
for self-interest.

360
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,448
- No, no, no. I wasn't... I wasn't doing that.
- No, of course not.

361
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,841
Of course not. Of course not.

362
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,724
Now, let's talk.

363
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,290
You and Quarry got some work to do first.

364
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,166
(SIGHING)

365
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,846
- Can he be direct?
- You both are.

366
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,689
Like I said, there's a lot going on presently.

367
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,166
Hey.

368
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,806
Hey, hey, wait a minute.

369
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,803
Wait a minute. Hi.

370
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,645
Hey. Remember me?

371
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,688
No? Remember the Sunnyside Motel?

372
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,000
Great seeing you again.

373
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,560
Hey, what happened after we left?

374
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,120
It's okay, you know? I work for him, so...

375
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,446
Oh, wonderful.

376
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,761
I'll be sure to look for you
at the Christmas party.

377
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,490
What did you do with Harlow?

378
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,006
Can you kindly
get the fuck out of my way now?

379
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,764
Listen to what I'm fucking
asking you right now.

380
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,604
What did you do with Harlow?

381
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,604
You got him killed if my memory serves me.

382
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,330
No, you know what I mean.

383
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,526
(CHUCKLES)

384
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,367
Hope that wife of yours
is getting the help she needs.

385
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,011
- Yeah, with what?
- You.

386
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,923
Now, not so kindly,

387
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,924
get the fuck out of my way.

388
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,445
(ENGINE STARTS)

389
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,280
Hey, what's her story?

390
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,681
Who gives a shit? Let's go.

391
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,849
(MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO)

392
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,765
How much we got coming in that shipment?

393
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,322
Uh, about five kilos.

394
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,449
$80,000, give or take, street value.

395
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,724
Hand me that pipe wrench.

396
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:02,488
MAC: So what's so special about this bastard
that we both need to be on direct?

397
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,609
BUDDY: Old Credence is a Highway 61 boy.

398
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,004
Been in and out of the penal farm
since he was just a little redneck drug dealer.

399
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,405
These things that you're saying
are supposed to mean something to me?

400
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:19,485
Dixie-fried wildasses
that are meaner than a sack of weasels.

401
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:22,769
They're all related or fucking or both.

402
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,089
And Credence Mason is their goddamn king.

403
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,003
MAC: And now we have to kill that man.

404
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,003
Yeah, not just him.

405
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:38,009
MAC: See, I... I thought the system
wasn't supposed to work this way, you know?

406
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,607
Multiple targets, two on direct. (SCOFFS)

407
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,002
How's anything supposed to work, anyway?

408
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,248
No, we're on the job.

409
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,963
Well, I'm thirsty.

410
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,406
Hey, what the hell is wrong with you?

411
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,641
- (SCOFFS)
- Hmm?

412
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,725
You did two tours in 'Nam, right?

413
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,610
How many people did you kill over there?

414
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:32,882
When I first started working for The Broker,
I'd keep track.

415
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,248
Not, "Write Shit Down", keep track.

416
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,926
Nothing stupid like that, but just

417
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,448
remember their names.

418
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,402
Like they were lovers or something,
I don't even know what.

419
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,211
Wasn't even something
I was consciously trying to do.

420
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,408
I just did.

421
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,807
Until one day, I...

422
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,649
I didn't.

423
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,963
How come?

424
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,763
I don't know.

425
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,730
I don't even remember stopping.

426
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,164
Just realizing that I had.

427
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,411
I never knew none of their names.

428
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,730
And yet, you're one of the two
most important people in their lives.

429
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,970
Their mama

430
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,646
who brought them into this circus

431
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,848
and us,

432
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,846
the ones who took down the tent.

433
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,166
(POUNDING ON CAR)

434
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,127
Can I help you boys with something?

435
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,248
Oh, no. We're just playing hooky from work.

436
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,402
We're looking to, uh... To kill some time.

437
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,960
I think we're gonna hit a movie instead.

438
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,690
Are y'all cops?

439
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,489
Oh, God, no. No.

440
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,683
Well, y'all come play.

441
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:29,809
I'm about to get the Sizzler back up.

442
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,723
I'll go two-for-one.

443
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,690
- Halloween special.
- Oh, that's mighty generous of you, sir.

444
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,082
- I think we're gonna hit that movie.
- CREDENCE: No, no, no, come on, now.

445
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,407
Movies are bullshit.

446
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,926
We got pinball inside and rides galore.

447
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,691
We got a mechanical bull that...

448
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,930
(WHISPERING)

449
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,361
CREDENCE: Uh...

450
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,367
My man Burkhalter here
says y'all is a couple of faggots.

451
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,408
- Is that true?
- No. No, sir.

452
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,687
- We're just gonna be on our way.
- No, no, no.

453
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,286
You know what?
What makes your man Burkhalter

454
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,089
such an expert on the matter?

455
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,845
- MAC: Buddy, Buddy...
- What if we were, Burkhalter?

456
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,570
You know what? I'm fucking sick of it.

457
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,927
MAC: Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

458
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,126
Hey.

459
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:20,004
Hey, we... We didn't mean any harm, okay?

460
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,606
We're just trying to have
some time to ourselves today, all right?

00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,569
We're gonna be on our way.

462
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,721
Look here, boys.

463
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,564
Don't know y'all.

464
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,961
Don't know your business.

465
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,122
But I am into fun.

466
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,931
And even faggots gotta have fun, right?

I ain't talking about
what they do with their dicks.

(MAN SINGING UPBEAT SONG)

479
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,241
How are we not fucked, huh?

480
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,407
(BUDDY SCOFFS)

481
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,448
- Maybe we need to tell him.
- The hell we do.

482
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,249
We nearly came to blows with the target.

483
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,641
I wouldn't exactly call it careful and cautious.

484
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,165
BUDDY: Fuck him.

485
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,329
Who, Credence or The Broker?

486
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,289
BUDDY: Well, how about both?

487
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,761
Look, all I'm trying to do right now
is to finish these last few jobs

488
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,487
and not get myself arrested
or fucking killed in the process, all right?

489
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,642
Now, he said... He said it was something big.

490
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,922
I don't know much,
but a man like that says it's big,

491
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,081
I'm gonna take it seriously.

492
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,764
BUDDY: So how do you think he'd react

493
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,047
if we waltz in there
and tell him our cover's blown

494
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,724
a few hours after we started?

495
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,806
So...

496
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,564
All right, what's our timetable?

497
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,051
Two, three days for direct.

498
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,327
But what's to say
we don't just go back there right now

499
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,084
and we kill all three of them shitheads?

500
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,083
- We could do that. We could do that.
- Yeah.

501
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,050
But we still have to recover
Mr. Mason's stash.

502
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,730
Wait, what?

503
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,768
BUDDY: Boss wants it brought in.

504
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,444
- All of it. He didn't tell you?
- What's "It"?

505
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,249
No, he didn't tell me. What...

506
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,051
So, wait, we're dealing drugs now?

507
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,122
BUDDY: "Dealing drugs."

508
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,444
Drugs are about as useless to boss man
as tits on a boar hog.

509
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,807
Okay, so why does he want them?

510
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,928
BUDDY: Only thing he cares about?

511
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,890
Whoever's willing to pay
to kill whoever they want dead.

512
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,291
This time it's drugs.

513
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,651
Next time it's gambling debt
or someone's spouse or

514
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,927
the person they're sleeping with.

515

MAC:
Okay, so we gotta recover Credence's stash,

516
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:07,045
but the fuck who ran the scout on this
didn't even tell us how?

517
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,330
It's a perfect fucking system.

518
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,482
Scratch a cynic, you find an idealist.

519
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,040
You want perfection,
listen to some Bobbie Gentry.

520
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,282
Beyond that, you're gonna be hard pressed.

521
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,727
All right, what are we gonna do?

522
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,161
Well... (SIGHS)

523
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,086
I could run down to Kmart
and get us some Halloween costumes.

524
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,240
Fuck it.

525
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,207
It's called direct, right?

526
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,884
I'm just grabbing my jacket.
My friend's waiting outside.

527
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:49,362
Or you could've just called
and asked me how it was going.

528
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,885
JONI: I know. (CHUCKLES)

529
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,405
What if people had questions?

530
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,244
That's what you got me for.

531
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,810
JONI: Right.

532
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,689
Right, sorry.

533
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,364
I'm just nervous.

534
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,930
- Mmm.
- I mess you up?

535
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,411
No, no. It's okay.

536
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,448
None of them know you own the place.

537
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,045
Right.

538
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,930
Is this a good turnout?

539
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,604
LLOYD: Yeah, pretty good.

540
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,485
I wouldn't go getting too excited, though.

541
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,046
Open houses are mostly for kooks.

542
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,329
They get bored
and wanna come see how other people live

543
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,084
and go through their stuff.

544
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,482
Showings will catch
a lot more flies than these things.

545
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,925
JONI: Okay.

546
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,049
- All right, I'll be back when it's over.
- LLOYD: All righty.

547
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,811
JONI: Hi there.

548
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,684
Sorry to interrupt.

549
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,684
I'm the homeowner if you have any questions.

550
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,244
I live a street over.

551
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,926
Always loved this house, thought I'd pop in.

552
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,243
- Hope you don't mind.
- No, not at all.

553
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,641
THE BROKER: I remember
seeing you two moving in.

554
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,245
Wife and I were so happy

555
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,004
to see a young couple
moving in the neighborhood.

556
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,241
(CHUCKLES)

557
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,800
Well, we're very sad to be leaving.

558
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,644
You moving to a bigger place?

559
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,848
No. Uh, maybe.

560
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,764
My husband got a new job,
so we have to relocate.

561
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,524
What line of work he in?

562
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,931
He's a loan officer.

563
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,889
New bank opened up over in Jackson.

564
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,849
Hey, that's my line. Maybe I know him.

565
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:16,921
Probably not.

566
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,321
- He... He's pretty new to the business.
- Oh.

567
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,288
- Well...
- My niece and her fiancé

568
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,566
are actually in the market.

569
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,244
And they love this area.

570
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,687
- That's great.
- Young and in love.

571
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,091
Oh, that's wonderful.

572
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,969
Oh, you... You gotta see them.

573
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,010
They want the whole deal...
The babies, the house.

574
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,765
Probably just like you and your husband.

575
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,650
(CHUCKLES) Well, you know, uh,
there's a spare room down the hall.

576
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,006
Make a pretty great nursery.

577
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,570
- And you got the pool.
- Yeah.

578
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,166
That beautiful pool.
That has to be loads of fun.

579
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,527
My husband installed that himself, actually.

580
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,524
- Is that right? Impressive.
- Yeah.

581
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:55,049
My wife, Viv, and I,
we've been in our place now 25 years.

582
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,801
Thought about moving a couple times,
but could never quite pull the trigger.

583
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:04,410
You know, you can live in a lot of houses,
but not all houses are homes.

584
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,441
Still, a lovely couple like you,

585
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:10,808
I'm sure y'all will find ways
to fill your house full of love.

586
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,250
Yeah.

587
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,163
I should be going.

588
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:20,007
My wife, she likes to give candy apples
to trick-or-treaters, which, of course,

589
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,560
means I give candy apples
to the trick-or-treaters.

590
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,324
- Right.
- Nice talking to you.

591
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,004
You, too.

592
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,689
LLOYD: It's solidly built.

593
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,888
I don't know if you've
rapped your knuckles on it,

594
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,726
but those two bedrooms,
that full bath in there...

(MUSIC PLAYING)

596
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,289
Well, this ain't good.

597
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,407
CORN FED: Careful, Credence.

598
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,891
Morris!

599
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,450
Where you boys at?

600
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,170
They're right there

601
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,130
getting a tan.

602
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,770
CORN FED: The hell you think
happened to them?

603
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,805
Got me.

604
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,802
What you think?

605
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,645
Well, if I had to wager on it,

606
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:18,566
I'd say that somebody knew
them boys was coming.

607
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,486
Surprised them, shot them dead,

608
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,248
loaded them up in the truck right there,
set fire to it,

609
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,325
sunk the boat,
made off with a bunch of your heroin.

610
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,050
Well, shit.

611
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,803
Beats my guess.

612
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,689
I was gonna say it was Apaches.

613
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,648
How are we doing on stock?

614
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,085
CORN FED: Low.

615
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,926
Business is fine,
but that means dwindling stock.

616
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,321
We needed this here drop.

617
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:55,681
You, uh, think someone's making a move?

618
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,760
Yeah.

619
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,329
I think somebody already made it.

620
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,370
- (MUSIC PLAYING)
- I'm just so sorry for your wait.

621
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,568
Ladies first, enjoy.

622
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,567
They are working you too damn hard.

623
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,961
Oh, I have done a sight on Earth of work.

624
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,644
How y'all doing?

625
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,287
Been here since 5:30 this morning
'cause our new girl never showed.

626
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,204
And the busboy quit
'cause the boss accused him of stealing.

627
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,123
- Well, was he?
- Well, I sure wasn't the one

628
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,249
- jimmying open the cigarette machine.
- (LAUGHING)

629
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,607
Two? Right this way.

630
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,011
Hi.

631
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,162
What time do you get off?

632
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,409
I got another hour.

633
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,962
I am gonna go home

634
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:43,886
and spend the rest of the night
soaking in a warm bathtub.

635

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,244
BURKHALTER: Yeah. Pinball machines.

796
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,121
(GUNSHOT)

797
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,084
You ready?

798
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,327
(LINE RINGING)

799
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,323
- JONI: Hello?
- Hey.

800
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,006
- You okay?
- I...

801
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,684
Yeah.

802
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:38,451
Yeah.

803
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,045
Baby, what's wrong?

804
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,282
The hell are you going?

805
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,806
Just stay here. I'll call you.

806
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,201
(ENGINE STARTS)

807
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,089
You'll call me?

808
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:56,969
- Baby.
- JONI: Mac.

809
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,882
- Hey.
- What'd you see?

810
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,043
I saw... I don't know what I saw, okay?

811
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,724
It's probably nothing.

812
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,363
What's the job this time?

813
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,090
Who is it?

814
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,647
- Joni.
- Yeah, sorry.

815
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,685
Sorry I worried you, okay?

816
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,410
It was stupid. I just freaked out.

817
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,448
It's okay, baby, okay? You freaked out.

818
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,842
No big deal.
Now I'm here, we'll go freak out together.

819
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:31,810
(CHUCKLES) You should go do
whatever you have to do.

820
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,291
No, this is what I have to do.

821
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:35,408
Mac, I'll be fine. Go.

822
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,084
- It was a trick-or-treater, wasn't it?
- (CHUCKLES)

823
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:42,764
JONI: Probably, yeah.

824
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,490
Okay, I won't be long.

825
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:46,403
JONI: You won't?

826
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,323
Honestly, I...

827
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,448
I don't have any idea.

828
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,042
Just be safe, okay?

829
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,531
Okay.

830
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,445
(ENGINE STARTS)

831
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,843
That all we got left?

832
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,207
Yeah, that's all she wrote.

833
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,965
How much them Biloxi boys
say they was bringing us?

834
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,929
CREDENCE:
Enough to make up for what we lost.

835
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,607
Burkhalter say
he was gonna see that fat farmer girl tonight?

836
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:01,531
All right.

837
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,602
All right, we're gonna
cut through the park, okay?

838
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,446
And then you need to keep a line of sight
on that back door, all right?

839
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,726
What?

840
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,930
For a reluctant motherfucker,
you sure are gung-ho sometimes.

841
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,044
What are you taking?

842
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,885
Well, why? Are you a fucking narc?

843
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,084
All right, listen,

844
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,084
we're gonna
need a signal word or something, okay?

845
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,844
Okay.

846
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,002
How about... (WHISTLES)

847
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:40,605
You listen to me.

848
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,729
You sharpen the fuck up right now,
you understand me?

849
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:46,565
You know what he'd do if he knew
you were fucked up on the job, huh?

850
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,881
You wanna get twisted?
You wanna get fucked up?

851
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,610
You do it on your own time,

852
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:53,445
not when my life is at stake,
you understand me?

853
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:07,600
Let's go.

854
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,604
You see something, you know what to do.

855
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:12,971
Come on.

856
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,969
(CAR APPROACHING)

857
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:56,567
Oh, fuck.

858
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:59,047
What the hell we got here?

859
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,246
(CAR DOORS CLOSE)

860
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,526
(KNOCKING)

861
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,369
- That them?
- (KNOCKING CONTINUES)

862
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,408
CREDENCE: Could be.

863
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:26,450
Them Biloxi boys drive fast.

864
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,962
Let's get this done so we can get down there
and see them clabber-butted girls

865
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:34,691
shake their titties
to Kool and the Gang songs.

866
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:56,126
TOMMY: Conway.

867
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,928
The fuck?
