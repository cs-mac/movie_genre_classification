1
00:00:47,603 --> 00:00:51,410
Sonjusha, you're bitter about
my imprisonment, and ask,

2
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:55,090
"How is it that some people
may decide the life of others?"

3
00:00:56,378 --> 00:00:58,682
The entire history of civilization is based,

4
00:00:59,511 --> 00:01:02,456
on decisions on the life
other people lead,

5
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:05,793
which has its roots deep in
material living conditions.

6
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:09,520
Only a new, painful development
can bring change.

7
00:01:10,976 --> 00:01:13,507
You ask: "What's it all for?"

8
00:01:15,605 --> 00:01:19,912
You can't question life and all its forms.

9
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:23,984
I don't really know why there
are bluetits in the world,

10
00:01:25,028 --> 00:01:29,472
but their existence is a joy, and
it's a sweet consolation to hear,

11
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:33,960
their tweets from a short
distance over the wall.

12
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,146
Sonitshka, stay happy
and calm for my sake.

13
00:01:42,786 --> 00:01:44,732
You'll see that it'll all turn out.

14
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:50,983
Regards to you, Karl.  Hugs, Rosa.

15
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:20,420
Quick, help me up!

16
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:30,191
- One of them's Brodna.
- Kaminski and Kozinski, I don't know the other one.

17
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,054
Murderers! Executioners!

18
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,536
Aim!

19
00:03:38,022 --> 00:03:38,437
Fire!

20
00:03:48,031 --> 00:03:48,882
Anna Matschke.

21
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,249
Murderers.

22
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,161
- How long are you going to wait for it, honey?
- I want to see it bloom.

23
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,993
It sleeps at night just like you do.
Tomorrow you'll see a flower, Rosa.

24
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:05,888
Blindfold off.

25
00:05:07,327 --> 00:05:09,941
It was a mistake, madame.

26
00:05:13,828 --> 00:05:17,006
Which doesn't mean that you
won't be shot one day.

27
00:05:17,999 --> 00:05:18,749
Sit down.

28
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:32,404
- Have you got anything to tell me today?
- No.

29
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,388
Why not?

30
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:37,502
For the same reason as before.
I don't know anything.

31
00:05:38,888 --> 00:05:43,622
There's one thing you know.
Your name isn't Anna Matschke.

32
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:47,173
Prussian authorities were very helpful.

33
00:05:47,174 --> 00:05:53,219
You seem to be of the same
value to the Tsar authorities.

34
00:05:55,045 --> 00:05:59,940
Luxemburg is an important name in
the movement of German Socialism,

35
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:02,344
and international socialism.

36
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:07,402
She incites passion to move
from words to actions,

37
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:12,041
in other words, to annul
the existing social order,

38
00:06:12,227 --> 00:06:16,905
by way of revolution, whatever the means.

39
00:06:18,547 --> 00:06:19,454
Good work, eh?

40
00:06:22,477 --> 00:06:25,963
Now we don't need to find
out the name of the man,

41
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:29,459
who was arrested at the same time with you.

42
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:55,901
My name's Anna Matschke now.
Tell your comrades who I am.

43
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:05,327
We use agitation, not weapons.

44
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:10,853
- What does Leo say?
- Weapons are intended only for defense.

45
00:07:13,025 --> 00:07:17,851
- We must protect our own.
- Agitation is of course important.

46
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:20,422
It's dangerous to shake up the
government with group appearances.

47
00:07:21,309 --> 00:07:23,534
Tsarist administration discarded Socialist agitation.

48
00:07:23,536 --> 00:07:28,565
We're not throwing bombs
or wounding the police.

49
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:35,183
Agitation will pave the way to a
general strike and street revolt,

50
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:46,794
which will extend the revolutionary
turmoil to the countryside, villages ...

51
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:11,323
- You're forbidden from coming here.
- You can't keep me out, Leo.

52
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:13,292
I'm a party member of the council, too.

53
00:08:14,154 --> 00:08:16,397
You're more useful in
Berlin than in Poland.

54
00:08:16,827 --> 00:08:19,558
I was, as long as you were
sending information regularly.

55
00:08:20,006 --> 00:08:21,533
Lately, I've had to beg downright.

56
00:08:22,386 --> 00:08:26,405
- Now I get it from the top myself.
- I don't want you to stay.

57
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:29,603
What use am I in Berlin, when
there's a revolution in Russia?

58
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:34,170
You can't leave me out of an
important historic moment.

59
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:40,701
I'm no longer that student
who you can boss around.

60
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:47,679
Give me a hug, I've missed you.

61
00:08:58,536 --> 00:09:01,769
Not: "the so-called reasonable
people consider socialism,"

62
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:04,173
"the product of a sick imagination,"

63
00:09:04,173 --> 00:09:07,612
but: "the so-called sensible people
maintain socialism as an illusion. "

64
00:09:07,795 --> 00:09:11,846
- That's too dry.
- Comprehensibility is the main thing.

65
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,490
You spoil everything with your fussiness.

66
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:20,062
And stop creeping around my back
all the time. It makes me nervous!

67
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:24,457
Once again the contents suffer
because of your temperament.

68
00:09:27,918 --> 00:09:31,541
- I'm the one who writes the article.
- It goes to press in only one week.

69
00:09:32,214 --> 00:09:40,018
What is needed are dialectics and a
groundbreaking idea. Do you understand?

70
00:09:40,175 --> 00:09:44,040
Groundbreaking ideas require time
to grow. That's the dialectic.

71
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,947
Time will tell who understands more
about it, even if it's a monkey.

72
00:09:49,407 --> 00:09:50,894
Your answer is better
than your article.

73
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:54,006
"What we need ..."

74
00:09:56,051 --> 00:09:57,782
Are you the author?

75
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,539
Among other things it's about
the freedom of the press.

76
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,646
The right of everyone to express their
views in speech and in writing.

77
00:10:05,881 --> 00:10:10,494
Everyone can have an opinion,
but not a printing press.

78
00:10:11,356 --> 00:10:12,956
That's why we came to you.

79
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:19,377
In the end, I'd prefer to
publish my own opinions.

80
00:10:36,061 --> 00:10:38,405
Anton. Prepare this.

81
00:10:40,429 --> 00:10:42,456
Open up! Police!

82
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,745
It seems that you don't know
who you have living here.

83
00:10:51,523 --> 00:10:52,771
Did you publish this?

84
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:57,444
This is a mistake, we're German journalists.

85
00:10:57,446 --> 00:10:58,041
Names?

86
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,307
- Anna Matschke and Otto Engelmann.
- Come with us.

87
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:06,418
Wait outside, we have to get changed.

88
00:11:06,418 --> 00:11:07,503
Hurry up!

89
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,293
I don't want the family to
blow this out of proportion.

90
00:11:16,185 --> 00:11:18,514
My imprisonment doesn't mean
you have to take care of me.

91
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:23,190
Not a single petition of amnesty or
any help from the German consul.

92
00:11:23,782 --> 00:11:26,094
Those gentleman can wait until I
ask for protection and rights myself.

93
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,751
More preferably I'd like
to get solitary confinement,

94
00:11:30,843 --> 00:11:33,842
I must convey to Germany
what I've heard and seen.

95
00:11:34,006 --> 00:11:35,663
They could court-martial you!

96
00:11:36,222 --> 00:11:39,193
If you keep speaking
German, this visit is over.

97
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,564
Those months in Warsaw have
been the best in my life.

98
00:11:46,738 --> 00:11:48,372
I'm worried about you, my sister.

99
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:53,418
We live in times of violent
change, all ready to collapse.

100
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:57,325
It's absurd to sit in jail for
something that might not happen.

101
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,634
It only seems that way to you!

102
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:04,682
We need patience, Josef. And good spirits.

103
00:12:05,091 --> 00:12:06,249
Your time's up.

104
00:12:12,763 --> 00:12:13,701
I'll come again.

105
00:12:56,752 --> 00:12:57,519
Your freedom.

106
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,645
I was probably only let out
because of my bad health.

107
00:13:05,396 --> 00:13:06,451
Have you heard about Leo?

108
00:13:09,077 --> 00:13:11,345
The German Press revealed him.

109
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:14,811
He was prosecuted.

110
00:13:15,313 --> 00:13:16,297
The charge read:

111
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:23,252
"Company of armed insurgency overturned
against the monarchistic administration,"

112
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:27,670
"prescribed in the Russian constitution. "

113
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:33,753
The same prosecution is expected for
you, too, if you don't leave quickly.

114
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:39,966
- Will you say goodnight, Aunt Rosa?
- Of course I will.

115
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:52,878
- Are you staying with us now?
- I need to return to Berlin.

116
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:53,979
Why?

117
00:13:55,397 --> 00:13:57,393
I work in the German Socialist Party.

118
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:01,339
It's the largest and strongest
labour movement in Europe.

119
00:14:01,777 --> 00:14:02,661
Are you coming back?

120
00:14:04,048 --> 00:14:07,989
I don't know.  I'll write to you a lot.

121
00:14:08,511 --> 00:14:11,081
- Will you put flowers inside?
- Lots of flowers.

122
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,745
Sing something.

123
00:14:14,825 --> 00:14:19,403
Valleys, the valleys.

124
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:24,177
The valley of a small creek.

125
00:14:24,628 --> 00:14:33,687
Why do not you love me?
Was I not nice?

126
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:38,538
Valleys, the valleys.

127
00:14:39,218 --> 00:14:43,335
The valley of a small meadow.

128
00:14:45,042 --> 00:14:52,904
Why do not you love me?
Am I just a toy ...

129
00:14:58,033 --> 00:15:00,380
Dziodziu, you kept your promise!

130
00:15:11,891 --> 00:15:15,287
- Take me in your arms.
- You're too heavy, Rosa.

131
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,496
Please, come on.

132
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:19,672
Just for a minute. You know I like it.

133
00:15:21,918 --> 00:15:23,543
So you're going to
be a terrorist, huh?

134
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:26,815
I want you to love me,
without fear of confession,

135
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:29,787
that you humiliate yourself with.

136
00:15:29,787 --> 00:15:34,654
You want to hear that you're the most
beautiful and the smartest woman I know.

137
00:15:34,946 --> 00:15:39,134
I am the best! I am a better human
being, so I submit to you.

138
00:15:40,804 --> 00:15:42,811
I wish that we would start living
together as man and wife.

139
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:46,417
We've lived together for a long time, Rosa.

140
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:51,407
I mean in our own apartment,
our own furniture, a library.

141
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:55,906
We can work in peace
together, take walks.

142
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:02,043
We can go to the opera sometimes,
have a trip in the country once a year.

143
00:16:29,715 --> 00:16:30,752
Good evening, August.

144
00:16:31,443 --> 00:16:34,890
This is Leo Tyszka. August
Bebel and his wife.

145
00:16:35,902 --> 00:16:38,717
- Nice to meet you. Do you speak German?
- Not very well, a little.

146
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,121
We'll meet again later.

147
00:16:42,224 --> 00:16:45,886
- Well, what a wonderful time.
- You wanted to dance.

148
00:16:47,115 --> 00:16:49,877
It's the best way to make acquaintances
without any formalities.

149
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:59,551
Leo Tyszka, a friend from Poland.
Hans and Luise Kautsky.

150
00:17:00,092 --> 00:17:02,369
- Nice to meet you.
- It's my pleasure.

151
00:17:02,911 --> 00:17:05,986
Luise is my best friend and we
almost never talk about politics.

152
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:09,732
- What about you?
- It's sometimes on my mind.

153
00:17:10,278 --> 00:17:12,591
- Where's Carolus Magnus?
- Over there. He doesn't dance.

154
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,396
Leo Tyszka, teacher
and master from Poland.

155
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,273
Karl Kautsky, my teacher in Germany.

156
00:17:26,353 --> 00:17:26,991
Ignaz Auer.

157
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,136
- Have you come directly from Poland?
- No, Zürich.

158
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:39,081
You emigrated?

159
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,162
- Will you stay long in Berlin?
- I don't know yet.

160
00:17:47,023 --> 00:17:49,999
So you're a member of the Polish Socialist Party.

161
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:51,871
Yes, I'm the founder.

162
00:17:53,247 --> 00:17:55,354
The same man who had a
dispute with Plekhanov?

163
00:17:58,711 --> 00:18:01,726
Interesting.  Can I ask you
a couple of questions?

164
00:18:14,001 --> 00:18:16,395
- Clara, how nice to see you.
- Good evening, Rosa!

165
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:20,278
Let me introduce my sons.
Maxim and Kostja.

166
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,063
I didn't know that your
children were so grown up.

167
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,561
Visit Stuttgart sometimes.

168
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,681
- We'll certainly get along well.
- Of course.

169
00:18:34,795 --> 00:18:38,488
- May I?
- I don't want to dance with you, Comrade Bernstein.

170
00:18:38,979 --> 00:18:44,018
We're not in the party now. A
celebration is a time for enjoyment.

171
00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:47,371
I can't have fun with you today
or have any connection tomorrow.

172
00:18:47,617 --> 00:18:49,296
It's a wonderful party!

173
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,736
Rosa gave him the brush-off.

174
00:19:13,011 --> 00:19:15,388
Bernstein has something
to complain about again.

175
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:18,449
He mixes up humour and
opportunism. His nature.

176
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:23,668
- When will you expel me too?
- I don't expel anyone, I go my own way.

177
00:19:24,203 --> 00:19:25,229
Come on Leo, let's dance!

178
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:44,466
- What impression did you get of Karl?
- He doesn't know Poland, at least.

179
00:19:45,536 --> 00:19:47,807
He's let me write about it until now.

180
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,069
You should pull a few
strings with each of them.

181
00:19:57,468 --> 00:20:01,385
That method works in a Polish puppet show,

182
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,555
but not the majority of the party!

183
00:20:49,622 --> 00:20:53,518
Happily, proudly and confidently,

184
00:20:54,598 --> 00:20:58,575
the class-conscious proletariat
moves into the 20th century.

185
00:20:59,293 --> 00:21:05,670
One century has gone, I hope the
future century is one of fulfilment.

186
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:13,228
Progress has been magnificent,
and even better, it's continuing!

187
00:21:39,824 --> 00:21:44,197
I've had a bad few days, therefore
I'm unhappy, therefore I'm unwell.

188
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,273
Now I promise that I won't
listen to my inner demons.

189
00:21:51,104 --> 00:21:53,792
Of course I'm unhappy sometimes,
because I always see from a distance,

190
00:21:53,793 --> 00:21:57,786
see and hear about what
means life and happiness.

191
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:02,616
I swear while I'm here I'll learn
self-patience and gentleness.

192
00:22:29,174 --> 00:22:30,794
- Luise!
- Rosa!

193
00:22:33,418 --> 00:22:35,696
Erna is even prettier than before.

194
00:22:37,902 --> 00:22:40,221
Here, this is for you, and
this is for the children.

195
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:45,905
- Let me see you.
- I'll take off the apron, you hate it.

196
00:22:46,037 --> 00:22:48,696
You don't know how much I've
missed that apron, leave it on.

197
00:22:51,183 --> 00:22:53,931
I would've returned to Berlin
earlier, with a passion,

198
00:22:54,101 --> 00:22:57,189
but I was afraid I'd get taken again
at Germany's border to the castle.

199
00:22:59,443 --> 00:23:02,030
Oh, Luise, how I've missed this.

200
00:23:03,475 --> 00:23:04,298
How are the children?

201
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:07,890
Bendl has been asking about you
and Karl wants to draw with you.

202
00:23:09,235 --> 00:23:11,214
And Leo? What's happened?

203
00:23:13,781 --> 00:23:15,951
He was sentenced to
several years of hard labour.

204
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:20,538
- Without precautions the same would've happened to you.
- What precautions?

205
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:26,075
What precautions, Luise? Tell the truth.

206
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:30,987
- I thought you knew. Bebel ordered it.
- Ordered what?

207
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:36,627
Your brother spoke about your condition and
that you'd be released against collateral.

208
00:23:36,877 --> 00:23:39,847
For god's sake, Rosa, it was the only
way to get you out of there.

209
00:23:39,848 --> 00:23:41,422
Against my specific will!

210
00:23:42,905 --> 00:23:46,470
I don't want to be indebted
to the party leadership!

211
00:23:46,471 --> 00:23:49,798
- Siberia would have killed you.
- How I hate all this patronizing!

212
00:23:50,793 --> 00:23:52,293
As my friend you should have stopped it.

213
00:23:54,492 --> 00:23:55,736
You don't know me at all.

214
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:05,286
You didn't do wrong, Lulu.

215
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:08,974
The most important thing is
that we're together again.

216
00:24:10,423 --> 00:24:12,918
And that I can put a little
life into this complacent place.

217
00:24:15,625 --> 00:24:20,295
This careful reticence. You have
to force yourself to read it.

218
00:24:20,296 --> 00:24:25,495
Instructive, dry.  How
laboured you've become.

219
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:29,947
- Like there's no blood in your veins.
- Not like Russians.

220
00:24:30,937 --> 00:24:32,363
What did the comrades
say about my article?

221
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:39,736
For some, parliament is a place that's more
important than strikes and street battles.

222
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:43,180
Trade Union Leader Legienin believes
that strikes are the worst threat.

223
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:46,259
And others with words like him
press the party more and more.

224
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,822
Russia's trade union movement
is a child of the revolution.

225
00:24:50,794 --> 00:24:53,623
Before the revolution there wasn't a
trace of professional organization.

226
00:24:54,249 --> 00:24:58,546
You have to believe that it grows
from peaceful conditions.

227
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:02,452
- I don't think so, Rosa.
- I wrote a booklet about it in Russia.

228
00:25:03,892 --> 00:25:06,324
In prison? How'd you manage that?

229
00:25:06,761 --> 00:25:08,927
There are courageous people
in the Tsar's jails, too.

230
00:25:10,334 --> 00:25:12,259
They smuggled articles to you.

231
00:25:13,718 --> 00:25:18,152
- How much space do I get?
- As much as a return to discipline allows.

232
00:25:19,454 --> 00:25:22,383
Now I present to you
Dr Rosa Luxemburg!

233
00:25:25,662 --> 00:25:28,467
Directly from Warsaw, where
she has been risking her life,

234
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:30,488
working for the Russian revolution.

235
00:25:38,221 --> 00:25:39,092
Comrades!

236
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:48,111
I've just been introduced as
a martyr of Russia's revolution.

237
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:52,285
I'd like to start off on a note of protest.

238
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:56,428
You probably have a completely
wrong picture of the revolution.

239
00:25:57,469 --> 00:26:01,969
Russian right-wing press presents
abroad a huge sea of blood,

240
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,058
and immense human suffering.

241
00:26:05,056 --> 00:26:09,605
That's a vision of the bourgeoisie,
not the proletariat class.

242
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:14,104
The people of Russia have
yielded for centuries.

243
00:26:14,388 --> 00:26:18,128
Russia has lived for centuries
in the yoke of monarchy.

244
00:26:19,306 --> 00:26:21,029
Has anyone ever asked,

245
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:26,199
how many thousands have
died of starvation or scurvy?

246
00:26:26,883 --> 00:26:33,152
How many thousand proletarians have
fallen in work, on the battlefield?

247
00:26:34,121 --> 00:26:37,537
How many infants have
died of malnutrition,

248
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:41,524
before the fulfilment of
their first year of life?

249
00:26:44,711 --> 00:26:48,072
These countless victims,
compared to this pain,

250
00:26:49,171 --> 00:26:51,173
of the present suffering is trivial.

251
00:26:52,391 --> 00:26:57,703
Before the nation survived and suffered
with no hope of anything better,

252
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:04,100
but now it knows for what
it falls, suffers and fights.

253
00:27:04,907 --> 00:27:07,730
Everyone knows they are participating
in the freeing of their people,

254
00:27:07,732 --> 00:27:11,134
for the sake of their
children and grandchildren.

255
00:27:27,328 --> 00:27:31,307
Could I trouble you a moment,
it's a personal matter.

256
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:37,877
I should decide whether or
not to get married now.

257
00:27:38,413 --> 00:27:42,166
Is marriage a thing of the past,
a trifling thing or what?

258
00:27:42,414 --> 00:27:45,707
- That depends on you.
- I've studied the matter.

259
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:48,838
If I were you, I'd take the simple approach.

260
00:27:50,498 --> 00:27:55,140
Thanks for the advice. My girlfriend
expects a child, she's also a comrade.

261
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,444
We didn't know whether marriage
was a bourgeoise conceit or not.

262
00:27:59,168 --> 00:28:02,299
- Thank you very much, Doctor.
- I wish you all the best.

263
00:28:02,966 --> 00:28:07,649
If you were pregnant, I would've
liked your speech even more.

264
00:28:35,471 --> 00:28:38,854
You need to decide if you want to
be a mother or a revolutionary.

265
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:40,852
- Both.
- Impossible.

266
00:28:40,852 --> 00:28:41,525
Why?

267
00:28:43,163 --> 00:28:45,930
- A baby will make you timid.
- You don't love me.

268
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:50,349
Your mission is to bring ideas into
the world. Those are your children.

269
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:03,868
- Will you come again tomorrow?
- As often as you want.  Good night.

270
00:29:04,842 --> 00:29:06,624
Your health, Rosa dear.

271
00:29:07,449 --> 00:29:09,432
To your return.

272
00:29:12,823 --> 00:29:13,744
To the revolution.

273
00:29:15,652 --> 00:29:17,553
Oh, dear Auer.

274
00:29:20,021 --> 00:29:24,038
We'll be stubborn mules if we don't take
a lesson from the Russian revolution.

275
00:29:25,068 --> 00:29:29,812
- Before you said that Russia was learning from us.
- And now I don't say that.

276
00:29:30,414 --> 00:29:34,609
The East is now the heart of revolution.
History is progressing in leaps and bounds.

277
00:29:34,788 --> 00:29:40,400
That's too big a leap.  Russia
can't be compared to Germany.

278
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,215
Every step forward in
parliamentarism is a leap.

279
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:49,175
I know that a revolution isn't something
you can just take command of.

280
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:52,485
It's about what Socialists can do:

281
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:55,203
knowingly participate in historical development.

282
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,804
You see? Rosa's come back from
Russia as a radical extremist.

283
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:06,897
When the revolution comes to Germany
she'll be on the left, and I'll be on the right.

284
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:11,002
But we'll hang them, they
won't ruin our good times.

285
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:13,330
You don't know yet who hangs who.

286
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:18,092
August, I love you all.

287
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:23,826
I'd like to say a few words
about Bebel's speech.

288
00:30:24,516 --> 00:30:26,778
I'm just not sure I
understood him correctly,

289
00:30:26,778 --> 00:30:30,932
because he sat on the left and
talked about too much about the right.

290
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:36,577
He talked about what Germany
could do and what should happen,

291
00:30:36,657 --> 00:30:40,523
if we have a war with Russia
because of Prussian intervention.

292
00:30:41,534 --> 00:30:46,356
I don't know if I understood correctly,
but I think he meant to say,

293
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:50,273
that if we are on the brink of
war, we can't do a thing about it.

294
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:50,947
Nonsense!

295
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:57,361
I dare not ever doubt it,
the party leadership maintains.

296
00:30:57,978 --> 00:31:02,339
As a pious member of the Party
I will state after the management:

297
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,619
Credo quia absurdum!

298
00:31:04,621 --> 00:31:06,356
"I believe, because it is absurd."

299
00:31:08,793 --> 00:31:15,103
That interpretation of Bebel's speech
would be embarrassing for our French friends.

300
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:19,514
You see, local comrades say:
rather an uprising than a war!

301
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,002
Men of the French proletariat
make themselves heard! I hope,

302
00:31:23,004 --> 00:31:29,418
that we also have the courage to
say: not a war against our will!

303
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:41,327
In connection with the war a
general strike has been considered.

304
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:45,425
The International Conference on
The Brussels Congress of 1868,

305
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,391
refers to the practical
measures to prevent war.

306
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:53,300
Namely, that society really can't operate,

307
00:31:53,766 --> 00:31:55,920
if production is stopped for some time.

308
00:31:56,644 --> 00:32:00,994
That the working classes, which are
almost exclusively recruited into war,

309
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,016
just need to suspend their work,

310
00:32:04,536 --> 00:32:09,266
in order to interrupt the monarchical governments
which only advocate their own interests.

311
00:32:12,542 --> 00:32:13,652
Bebel said:

312
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:19,243
"Do you think the party council is
able to carry out a general strike? "

313
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:23,220
"No! The masses must put
pressure on the party council."

314
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:31,372
Otherwise, if a party council
doesn't understand its role,

315
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,453
it will be pushed!

316
00:32:37,478 --> 00:32:41,644
I ask you, therefore, to
vote for Kautsky's proposal.

317
00:33:00,117 --> 00:33:03,427
- I think that hat fits you better.
- No, it suits you.

318
00:33:06,207 --> 00:33:09,857
- There isn't one for August.
- He seems to be angry with me.

319
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:13,415
- Because of the Mannheim speech?
- He offered money but I didn't care.

320
00:33:13,951 --> 00:33:16,206
You and your Polish friends need it.

321
00:33:16,206 --> 00:33:17,976
- There's other things.
- How so?

322
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:26,097
- You'd do exactly the same, as always.
- I don't know. I haven't been short of money.

323
00:33:26,878 --> 00:33:28,223
Let's get it written.

324
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:33,431
- Dearest August.
- No, 'Dear August'.

325
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:38,518
Too common. Dear Party Council,
my beloved August.

326
00:33:50,068 --> 00:33:54,324
- We need to get a grip.
- Yes, while there's still time.

327
00:33:54,871 --> 00:33:58,869
I can only get this boisterous
with another German.

328
00:34:01,692 --> 00:34:04,605
- To your freedom in Weimar.
- To life.

329
00:34:30,042 --> 00:34:33,755
I often went rowing with Leo
when I was studying in Zurich.

330
00:34:36,048 --> 00:34:39,349
"We'll stay far from the Germans,"
I wrote to him from Berlin.

331
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:44,611
"There are no conditions for
happiness for any pair in the world."

332
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:48,467
May god grant me to keep him.

333
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:11,303
I've done a lot of work.

334
00:35:14,083 --> 00:35:15,693
I don't always wish for success.

335
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:21,257
German Marxism is a gouty
old man who is afraid of fresh air.

336
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:27,541
- Have you buried your ridiculous idealism?
- Not at all.

337
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:32,279
I'm just not a conscientious donkey
any more, who toils for others.

338
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:36,661
At least you show that temperament
alone is not enough.

339
00:35:37,408 --> 00:35:39,837
Yes, and so can a monkey.

340
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:47,897
- Don't you want to talk about your travels?
- We have work, Rosa.

341
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,961
Yes, yes, business.

342
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:54,840
But I'd like to know.

343
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:01,308
Well, do I know the people
who you were hiding with?

344
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:07,595
- Were they friends?
- Yes.

345
00:36:11,078 --> 00:36:14,622
- Was there a woman there?
- Rosa, don't go into this.

346
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:22,805
Was she beautiful?

347
00:36:28,468 --> 00:36:31,291
It's certainly more enjoyable
to hide with a beautiful comrade.

348
00:36:37,787 --> 00:36:38,911
Did you sleep with her?

349
00:36:41,489 --> 00:36:43,101
- No.
- Swear.

350
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,645
Rosa, forget about it.

351
00:36:51,514 --> 00:36:52,673
I just want to know the truth.

352
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:00,819
Answer me, Dziodziu.

353
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:09,729
- You loved her.
- I wouldn't have come back to Berlin if I did.

354
00:37:12,318 --> 00:37:15,059
- You slept with her but didn't love her?
- Yes.

355
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:24,955
Why did you lie then ...

356
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:32,980
How can someone be with
another without loving them!

357
00:37:56,744 --> 00:38:00,422
- You can't compare it to us.
- Why not?

358
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:04,715
There are higher things.

359
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,086
- So that's why we work together?
- One of the reasons why.

360
00:38:10,063 --> 00:38:13,321
- Did you work with her?
- Of course, she was in the party.

361
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:17,226
So you loved her, you only know
how to love someone through work.

362
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:24,930
If it calms you down or makes you
feel better ... then I loved her!

363
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:28,871
- No, it doesn't calm me down!
- We're not talking about this any more.

364
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:41,099
I want you to leave.

365
00:38:47,488 --> 00:38:48,810
What should I do?

366
00:38:50,887 --> 00:38:52,323
I don't want to live with you any more.

367
00:39:08,698 --> 00:39:09,984
I'm serious, Leo.

368
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:15,852
Just because of some trifle?
Have you lost your reason?

369
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:19,376
If you love someone, it's not a trifle.

370
00:39:20,224 --> 00:39:22,662
Loving for better or worse.

371
00:39:24,769 --> 00:39:27,161
I only came to Berlin because of you.

372
00:39:28,318 --> 00:39:31,629
You came to Berlin because you
were forced to leave Poland.

373
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,520
- I couldn't work underground.
- So, you operate more efficiently here.

374
00:39:39,336 --> 00:39:41,431
And you'd pass over any
woman for your work.

375
00:39:45,756 --> 00:39:49,459
- Do you need anything else, Doctor?
- No, you can take the evening off.

376
00:39:49,956 --> 00:39:52,418
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Forget the 'Doctor' business.

377
00:39:53,461 --> 00:39:54,732
When is Dr Kristallowitsch coming?

378
00:39:57,633 --> 00:39:59,341
He isn't coming here again, Gertrud.

379
00:40:04,687 --> 00:40:05,270
Good night.

380
00:40:44,421 --> 00:40:46,544
You overestimate my maturity.

381
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:50,196
My inner balance and fortune fall,

382
00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:53,624
with even the slightest shadow blow.

383
00:40:55,404 --> 00:40:56,790
I suffer unspeakably.

384
00:40:58,309 --> 00:41:00,736
It's characteristic of me
to be dumbfounded.

385
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:43,608
Finally! We'd feared the worst.

386
00:41:43,372 --> 00:41:46,406
We were too close to the
soldiers' firing exercises.

387
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:50,182
They would have aimed more carefully
if they'd known you were standing there.

388
00:41:51,497 --> 00:41:56,555
Indeed they may have been hit.
We should have made a memorial.

389
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,905
- Two large women have left us.
- While remaining forever unforgettable.

390
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:04,640
Here lie two noble, brave women,

391
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:09,998
whose struggle for progress, peace and justice,

392
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,665
will always be our model.

393
00:42:13,777 --> 00:42:17,135
Or here rest the last two men
of the German social democracy.

394
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,658
We've achieved more than many
other countries' political parties.

395
00:42:26,112 --> 00:42:29,595
We have influence.  We're not
working underground any more.

396
00:42:30,211 --> 00:42:34,613
We can have an effect officially.
Within certain limits, of course,

397
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:38,444
but the number of votes has
increased in all the elections so far.

398
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:40,257
Yes, Rosa knows this.

399
00:42:40,565 --> 00:42:46,464
Which is therefore more to lose!
Rosa doesn't take it into account.

400
00:42:46,634 --> 00:42:47,536
What you have achieved?

401
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:50,702
That the unions decide and
the masses aren't asked.

402
00:42:51,613 --> 00:42:53,028
The masses have a voice.

403
00:42:53,979 --> 00:42:56,703
They've had enough parliamentarism.

404
00:42:57,935 --> 00:43:01,197
The party must be ahead of
events, not dragged behind.

405
00:43:01,198 --> 00:43:04,204
A general strike can't be declared
before it's necessary.

406
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:08,034
We'll use that method as
soon as the situation is ripe.

407
00:43:08,034 --> 00:43:13,559
At the moment, impatience
would be a loss, not a victory.

408
00:43:14,061 --> 00:43:19,366
You mess up moderation at your convenience.
You have composure, but others are divided.

409
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:20,756
For example, the women's franchise.

410
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:24,908
- Why does the party support it only formally?
- That's not the issue here.

411
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:27,234
Clara's absolutely right.

412
00:43:28,186 --> 00:43:30,707
I've always asked you to take
care of more women's issues.

413
00:43:31,868 --> 00:43:36,575
Such an intelligent and argumentative
woman should devote herself to her sex.

414
00:43:36,576 --> 00:43:40,942
- And leave the big things for men.
- Go ahead, if they're capable of it.

415
00:43:41,032 --> 00:43:44,318
- Rosa isn't argumentative, just courageous.
- We don't deny it.

416
00:43:44,618 --> 00:43:46,309
Courage itself is not a virtue.

417
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,064
Courage is needed at the right time.
It will be found, I promise you, Rosa.

418
00:43:51,864 --> 00:43:54,468
And I promise to remind
you of your promise, August.

419
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:05,381
I've given you permission to
work here, but not on Sunday.

420
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,324
- I want to talk to you about us.
- We are no longer talking.

421
00:44:14,267 --> 00:44:20,894
"My only Dziodziu.  Our lives are
better than those of others,

422
00:44:20,894 --> 00:44:24,252
because I know that our souls
are richer than most people."

423
00:44:25,224 --> 00:44:27,122
Burn them, they are no longer relevant.

424
00:44:27,802 --> 00:44:33,448
"Precious one. How I need
you, we need each other.

425
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:40,787
There is not such a task in life
as that of a single pair,

426
00:44:40,788 --> 00:44:44,135
to make a human being of each other.

427
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:50,987
It brings upon itself all the conditions of happiness."

428
00:44:52,576 --> 00:44:54,284
Do you remember what you wrote back?

429
00:44:58,163 --> 00:45:00,456
Pages of trade reports
on the work of the party.

430
00:45:02,083 --> 00:45:03,797
Not a shred of normal life.

431
00:45:07,062 --> 00:45:10,807
I had no lack of your abysmal scribbles.

432
00:45:11,479 --> 00:45:15,145
When did we allegedly live?
We just talked about it.

433
00:45:15,857 --> 00:45:17,424
- What about Zürich?
- That was a long time ago.

434
00:45:18,462 --> 00:45:19,178
What about Warsaw?

435
00:45:21,776 --> 00:45:23,869
- Warsaw!
- Don't shout, Kostja's asleep.

436
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:26,294
Who's Kostja?

437
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:30,277
Kostja Zetkin. Clara's son's here in Berlin.

438
00:45:30,984 --> 00:45:32,017
Clara asked him.

439
00:45:40,345 --> 00:45:41,011
Good day.

440
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:56,448
- Has that pup fallen in love with you?
- None of your business.

441
00:45:57,697 --> 00:46:00,346
I don't think Clara will be
very happy about that.

442
00:46:02,287 --> 00:46:06,639
- I'll kill you, and him too.
- You're not that childish.

443
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:12,358
Do you want me to grovel
on the floor in front of you?

444
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:14,536
I just want you to leave me alone.

445
00:46:15,497 --> 00:46:16,070
Please.

446
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:19,629
You won't get that from me.

447
00:46:27,833 --> 00:46:29,475
I won't ever leave you alone.

448
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:40,173
Battling for the party doesn't
suit your character.

449
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,749
It's a disservice that's a
constant of all human beings.

450
00:46:54,065 --> 00:46:58,367
You should stay in a spiritual job.
Philosophy, economics, history.

451
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:03,296
Or start writing. I'm sure
you know how to write well.

452
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:06,568
Listen, a great tit.

453
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:15,786
You haven't yet experienced
how animals help people.

454
00:48:00,104 --> 00:48:03,078
- When are you going to London?
- In three days.

455
00:48:04,777 --> 00:48:08,694
- Can't you skive off this time?
- Oh, Bubu.

456
00:48:12,476 --> 00:48:14,365
Party affairs aren't like schooldays.

457
00:48:15,856 --> 00:48:18,321
- Will Leo Jogicheskin be there?
- Of course.

458
00:48:20,132 --> 00:48:22,174
All the Russian and Polish Social Democrats.

459
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:24,237
What if he threatens you again?

460
00:48:26,556 --> 00:48:29,000
I've gotten a small pistol.

461
00:48:35,316 --> 00:48:35,835
Listen.

462
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:39,317
Let me explain to you ...

463
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:41,708
- Is there anything you can't explain?
- No.

464
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:52,221
Why do you love such an ungainly duck?

465
00:48:57,877 --> 00:48:59,562
You find it hard to accept our friendship.

466
00:49:01,759 --> 00:49:05,238
- He tried to hide it from me.
- I asked him to.

467
00:49:08,118 --> 00:49:08,643
Why?

468
00:49:11,959 --> 00:49:13,444
I thought it would upset you.

469
00:49:17,006 --> 00:49:18,977
If I were your friend I would've
earned your confidence.

470
00:49:20,401 --> 00:49:22,888
You know how hard it is to
talk about private affairs.

471
00:49:24,387 --> 00:49:27,115
Love isn't a private affair,
it applies to me too.

472
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,295
I'd be the worse off if
Kostja chose between us.

473
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:44,281
My son must be happy that
he met a woman like you.

474
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:51,965
- Why not publish my article?
- For some time,

475
00:49:52,031 --> 00:49:56,911
I've clearly expressed that
publication would be a mistake.

476
00:49:57,242 --> 00:49:59,994
Particularly now, when elections
are around the corner.

477
00:50:00,402 --> 00:50:04,632
We mustn't spoil the chances of
rising to be the strongest party.

478
00:50:04,633 --> 00:50:08,675
We can improve them!
Strengthen the party in battle.

479
00:50:08,675 --> 00:50:12,979
My opinion is that groups
are not ripe for revolution.

480
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:17,104
Karl, it's not even an
issue of revolution now,

481
00:50:17,977 --> 00:50:20,890
but that of a strong mass movement
from the Democratic Republic.

482
00:50:21,026 --> 00:50:24,230
And you just close up,
let the groups decide.

483
00:50:24,715 --> 00:50:28,848
Our task is to present
reasons for and against!

484
00:50:30,682 --> 00:50:35,591
Your article would require my
dissenting opinion as a balance.

485
00:50:35,763 --> 00:50:38,288
The situation's the same as in Russia in 1905.

486
00:50:38,290 --> 00:50:42,547
Demonstrations in Berlin
grow, mines go on strike.

487
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:46,013
The party shuffles behind events
and doesn't go ahead of them.

488
00:50:46,014 --> 00:50:49,287
- The party's majority does not support you.
- You mean the party on the Council.

489
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,654
I imagined that we agreed on key issues.

490
00:50:56,685 --> 00:50:58,972
Now it seems that your
Marxism just gives up on you,

491
00:50:59,492 --> 00:51:02,962
when a revolutionary situation arises.

492
00:51:02,963 --> 00:51:07,808
- After another 20 years you'll think the same.
- I don't ever intend to think like you.

493
00:51:11,765 --> 00:51:14,578
Karl himself is accused of
extremes now.

494
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:16,310
That's not a reason to back off.

495
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:21,373
Right now, when the German monarchy
falters for the first time,

496
00:51:22,057 --> 00:51:24,622
and the Democratic Republic
would really be possible.

497
00:51:25,007 --> 00:51:25,885
What are you going to do?

498
00:51:28,654 --> 00:51:31,150
If the Party Council silences me
I'll turn directly to the groups.

499
00:51:33,376 --> 00:51:36,345
I'll talk in a dozen towns, I'll
get 50,000-100,000 listeners.

500
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:38,701
Hopefully my voice will hold out.

501
00:51:41,307 --> 00:51:42,262
Oh, Luise.

502
00:51:45,608 --> 00:51:48,985
Your husband's cowardly. He
doesn't deserve a wife like you.

503
00:51:49,447 --> 00:51:53,222
He's not so bad.  Put yourself
in his shoes, for once.

504
00:51:58,017 --> 00:52:01,066
If you want to see me,
you'll have to visit me.

505
00:52:01,412 --> 00:52:04,686
- I won't stay in this house now.
- That's being hard on me.

506
00:52:06,584 --> 00:52:07,861
It's hard on me too.

507
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,702
This noise is a narcotic to my sick heart.

508
00:52:32,779 --> 00:52:34,325
It's probably my only medicine.

509
00:52:37,450 --> 00:52:39,852
I would preferably live only with you, Mimi.

510
00:53:03,412 --> 00:53:04,751
Ladies and gentlemen.

511
00:53:06,285 --> 00:53:07,495
Recently, many of us have been reminded,

512
00:53:08,198 --> 00:53:13,545
that we have 40 years of peace behind us.

513
00:53:15,203 --> 00:53:18,608
It was concluded that we are
heading towards the times,

514
00:53:18,812 --> 00:53:21,329
when peaceful development would be possible.

515
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:25,965
This illusion of growing peace has evaporated.

516
00:53:28,125 --> 00:53:30,809
Those who remembered
the 40 years of peace,

517
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:33,578
forgot about the wars that
have taken place outside Europe,

518
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:36,714
and in which Europe was involved!

519
00:53:38,005 --> 00:53:40,383
The classes which support the threat of war,

520
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:47,684
are reponsible for the buildup of
madness on borders and seas,

521
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:50,924
under the guise of peace-keeping!

522
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:56,916
And the liberal parties also,

523
00:53:56,917 --> 00:54:01,057
who have renounced all
suppression of militarism!

524
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:07,081
It is said that fighting
is part of human nature.

525
00:54:07,496 --> 00:54:10,873
We can't equip ourselves without
hurrying from the danger of our neighbours.

526
00:54:11,315 --> 00:54:17,471
We disagree. People can,
and they must live in peace!

527
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:22,326
The dominant think they have
the right to make decisions,

528
00:54:22,326 --> 00:54:26,610
while ignoring public opinion
of such vital issues.

529
00:54:27,303 --> 00:54:28,181
I ask you:

530
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:33,826
Can we allow a war we don't want,

531
00:54:34,162 --> 00:54:36,174
to be instigated without impunity?

532
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:43,275
If we are required to raise
a weapon of murder,

533
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:48,088
against our French brothers,
or any other, we will shout:

534
00:54:48,636 --> 00:54:50,126
We do not agree!

535
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:55,127
My stomach hurts.

536
00:54:57,735 --> 00:55:01,531
It is surprising the accused has in recent years

537
00:55:01,739 --> 00:55:04,667
known how to keep making
inflammatory speeches,

538
00:55:05,263 --> 00:55:08,019
without being guilty of
committing a crime.

539
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:12,371
It is a sign of a rare intelligence.

540
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:15,278
She is known for her sharp words.

541
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:19,256
It isn't for nothing that she
is called "Red Rosa".

542
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:23,183
The submission of the accused to punishment,

543
00:55:23,801 --> 00:55:26,292
corresponds to her role in the past,

544
00:55:26,941 --> 00:55:33,153
and a very hostile state of mind.

545
00:55:36,508 --> 00:55:41,129
I will come to the essence of the charge.
The prosecution concludes as follows.

546
00:55:41,501 --> 00:55:45,884
Because I agitate against militarism
and want to prevent a war,

547
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:52,282
I obviously did not know a better
way than to say to the soldiers:

548
00:55:52,284 --> 00:55:55,116
When you are told to shoot, don't shoot.

549
00:55:55,917 --> 00:55:59,268
Is not that right, honoured council?

550
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:01,729
What superior logic in the
convincing conclusion.

551
00:56:03,065 --> 00:56:07,307
Let me say, however, that
this logic is the result of,

552
00:56:07,309 --> 00:56:10,462
the prosecutor, not perceptions
of social democracy.

553
00:56:11,033 --> 00:56:11,915
We don't think,

554
00:56:12,771 --> 00:56:15,446
that the outbreak of war
and the final result,

555
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,930
will be solved by the army, superior
orders, and blind obedience,

556
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:28,638
but the solution is integrated
deeply within the people.

557
00:56:29,546 --> 00:56:33,611
If the vast majority of the
people reaches the belief,

558
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:39,589
and awareness of the campaign that
the Social Democrats have made,

559
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,221
if the majority reaches the belief,

560
00:56:45,108 --> 00:56:49,966
that wars are deeply immoral and base,

561
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:53,426
an impossible phenomenon,

562
00:56:53,427 --> 00:56:55,705
then people will react against it.

563
00:56:57,666 --> 00:57:00,120
- Thank you, Paul.
- For what?

564
00:57:00,544 --> 00:57:03,845
- For coming here with me so I'm not alone.
- Look around, you're not.

565
00:57:05,562 --> 00:57:06,590
I didn't mean that.

566
00:57:07,172 --> 00:57:09,662
People love you.  Even the
right-wing press respects you.

567
00:57:09,663 --> 00:57:12,989
- Respect for "Red Rosa"?
- They call Bebel "The Emperor's Contender"!

568
00:57:26,707 --> 00:57:31,578
In front of you stands a major criminal
proclaimed an outlaw by the state,

569
00:57:32,124 --> 00:57:36,140
a refugee from the prosecutor,
a condemned woman.

570
00:57:36,758 --> 00:57:41,155
I wouldn't switch with the prosecution
for what is in their homeland.

571
00:57:42,245 --> 00:57:47,861
I have a bigger and dearer homeland.

572
00:57:48,930 --> 00:57:54,160
What else but the Fatherland, and
crowds of working men and women?

573
00:57:58,022 --> 00:58:01,865
Remember what Wallenstein says
in Schiller's play on that night,

574
00:58:02,774 --> 00:58:04,723
when he examines the stars,

575
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:07,919
to interpret the future course of events.

576
00:58:08,976 --> 00:58:12,962
"Day is near, and Mars is dominated by the moment."

577
00:58:13,246 --> 00:58:14,783
That's still suitable today.

578
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,623
Mars, the god of bloody war,
still dominates the moment.

579
00:58:19,624 --> 00:58:24,898
Still the ones who fall back on
weapons of murder have the power.

580
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:29,783
Still wars are prepared, still
parliaments are subjected.

581
00:58:29,785 --> 00:58:35,028
Still proposals for military expenditure
are made, but Wallenstein said:

582
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:39,189
The day is near. Our day.

583
00:58:40,552 --> 00:58:45,455
So approaches the day
when we will stand up.

584
00:58:46,116 --> 00:58:48,635
We will not carry out the image

585
00:58:48,963 --> 00:58:54,015
of massacre in the prosecution's timid eyes.

586
00:58:54,017 --> 00:59:00,297
No, with our jurisdiction we
can create a social order,

587
00:59:01,004 --> 00:59:02,862
which is worthy of the human race.

588
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:09,101
Society in which neither exploitation
nor genocide is known.

589
00:59:09,726 --> 00:59:12,318
Society, which implements the ideas,

590
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:18,905
of the oldest relgious founders
and ideals of major philosophers!

591
00:59:19,549 --> 00:59:23,615
In order to make that day
dawn as soon as possible,

592
00:59:24,774 --> 00:59:28,911
we shall be subjected to
forces to the extreme,

593
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:34,838
in defiance of all the prosecutors,
all military power.

594
00:59:52,476 --> 00:59:57,360
Dear Lulu. I have become
a vulnerable human being.

595
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,041
I tremble from every
shadow that touches me.

596
01:00:02,342 --> 01:00:04,892
Do you know what thought
persecutes and scares me?

597
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:08,981
I imagine that once again I
must step into a crowded hall.

598
01:00:09,804 --> 01:00:12,934
The glaring lights, the noise of the crowd.

599
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:17,312
The roar of applause when I
make my way to the podium.

600
01:00:18,652 --> 01:00:21,284
And it seems to me that I
could escape from this place.

601
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,620
Liebknecht and Levi are here.

602
01:00:28,793 --> 01:00:32,437
Your attorney's very fond of
you. Do you like him?

603
01:00:32,847 --> 01:00:36,527
When will you learn to keep our
work and my private life separate?

604
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,980
You didn't want to keep
them separate before.

605
01:00:39,338 --> 01:00:42,637
Before I thought we needed each other
in order to become good human beings.

606
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:45,464
Is that what's become
of us?  Both alone?

607
01:00:46,095 --> 01:00:49,577
- Karl, it's a pleasure to have you as an ally.
- The pleasure's all mine.

608
01:00:52,594 --> 01:00:53,376
Hello, Paul.

609
01:00:54,436 --> 01:00:58,094
- Are you feeling better?
- Much better. How wonderful...Gertrude!

610
01:00:58,095 --> 01:00:58,564
Good day.

611
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:02,786
Mathilde Jacob, I'm a secretary.

612
01:01:07,017 --> 01:01:10,534
Have you read the "Forward" paper?
It borrows from the right-wing press.

613
01:01:11,198 --> 01:01:14,876
"The behaviour of this
presumptuous woman must stop".

614
01:01:16,116 --> 01:01:19,546
- The authorities prick up their ears.
- The appeal is pending.

615
01:01:20,029 --> 01:01:23,772
Rosa's not healthy, and she's
needed outside of prison.

616
01:01:26,111 --> 01:01:27,717
Would you get the tea, Leo?

617
01:01:28,922 --> 01:01:29,613
Is it ready?

618
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:32,974
Come and sit, Mathilde.

619
01:01:54,233 --> 01:02:00,463
Is it possible that the social democrats would
vote against the government if war breaks out?

620
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:04,850
Only if they put pressure on the
representatives in public so strongly,

621
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:08,519
that they no longer dare act
against the will of the people.

622
01:02:09,409 --> 01:02:13,354
I've prepared a text which
I'd like to discuss with you.

623
01:02:17,019 --> 01:02:19,721
What is the proletariat?

624
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:24,144
It is a group of people and community,

625
01:02:24,576 --> 01:02:27,715
who loves peace and hates war.

626
01:02:29,032 --> 01:02:34,380
A number of frenzied patriots however,

627
01:02:35,071 --> 01:02:37,309
revels in the massacre of war.

628
01:02:38,514 --> 01:02:42,689
But when your own head
bears the risk of conflict,

629
01:02:43,145 --> 01:02:49,077
when wars devour bourgeoisie
and workers alike,

630
01:02:49,716 --> 01:02:54,660
they will remember their allies
and try to quell the storm.

631
01:02:55,606 --> 01:02:58,346
However, the terrain of these
gentlemen has been mined.

632
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:03,093
In the face of the initial enthusiasm,
and the initial euphoria of fighting,

633
01:03:03,094 --> 01:03:05,896
they manage to sweep the
masses along with them.

634
01:03:06,364 --> 01:03:11,006
But when typhoid decides
to do the work of grenades,

635
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:14,336
when death and misery strike,

636
01:03:15,059 --> 01:03:17,018
so men of reason,

637
01:03:17,513 --> 01:03:21,193
in Germany, France, Russia and Italy,

638
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:25,345
will demand their leaders' accountability
for the number of bodies.

639
01:03:26,379 --> 01:03:31,101
And released from its shackles,
the revolution will answer them:

640
01:03:31,732 --> 01:03:35,154
"Go and ask for forgiveness
from god and man. "

641
01:03:43,342 --> 01:03:49,390
It is my pleasure to welcome a
brave woman, Rosa Luxemburg,

642
01:03:50,567 --> 01:03:56,475
whose thoughts shine in the
hearts of the German proletariat.

643
01:04:01,483 --> 01:04:05,355
- Over to you, madame.
- I can't.

644
01:04:08,770 --> 01:04:14,668
- You would have to remain silent.
- Leo, you weren't there.

645
01:04:15,766 --> 01:04:19,555
If only you had seen. The
atmosphere in that hall.

646
01:04:20,618 --> 01:04:23,414
The workers shouted out that
they dare not start a war,

647
01:04:23,415 --> 01:04:26,981
- And that we have the Socialist International.
- That's true.

648
01:04:31,482 --> 01:04:34,183
I'm afraid of the death of the Socialist
National and the victory of nationalism.

649
01:04:37,102 --> 01:04:38,057
War's going to come.

650
01:04:40,489 --> 01:04:42,070
The majority of socialists will march along.

651
01:04:45,957 --> 01:04:46,665
I know it.

652
01:04:49,347 --> 01:04:51,332
Was I supposed to pretend
to believe in the future?

653
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:55,266
No. You're right.

654
01:05:01,146 --> 01:05:01,594
Dziodziu ...

655
01:05:05,254 --> 01:05:07,932
I've never been so
desperate in my life.

656
01:05:27,896 --> 01:05:31,838
They all voted in favour. War
loans have been approved.

657
01:05:44,278 --> 01:05:46,999
- What about the minority?
- It bent to the party line.

658
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:49,395
Haase talked to the group.

659
01:05:49,888 --> 01:05:52,934
"In a time of distress the love of one's country
shouldn't be left to the responsibility of the right."

660
01:05:52,935 --> 01:05:54,954
"The workers wouldn't understand it."

661
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,705
If August were here this
never would've happened.

662
01:06:00,134 --> 01:06:02,450
I was shouted down as unpatriotic.

663
01:06:05,982 --> 01:06:08,797
- What about Kautsky?
- Two of his sons have been called into service.

664
01:06:09,453 --> 01:06:13,911
Right now everyone's going to
have to shoulder their own cross.

665
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:17,279
We'll show that the Socialists also
know how to die for the Fatherland.

666
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,415
If brigands are attacking my house,

667
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:26,785
I wouldn't speculate on
humanity, but shoot.

668
01:06:27,264 --> 01:06:29,288
And the same to the Socialist International, huh?

669
01:06:30,972 --> 01:06:33,576
The workers were in favour of
war. What else could we do?

670
01:06:34,245 --> 01:06:38,494
Abstentions would've made
us enemies of the fatherland.

671
01:06:39,094 --> 01:06:41,059
It wouldn't be good for
the future of the party.

672
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:44,043
- I've got to go.
- I'll see you this evening, Karl.

673
01:06:59,896 --> 01:07:02,012
Don't go inside.  It's all
been for nothing, Sonja.

674
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:07,143
- Let's go home.
- Karl probably needs me now.

675
01:07:22,341 --> 01:07:27,911
- We'll never see each other again, Rosa.
- What are you talking about, Kostja?

676
01:07:33,421 --> 01:07:36,158
War won't last that long, you'll see.

677
01:07:37,764 --> 01:07:39,674
When hunger comes, the mind changes.

678
01:07:57,263 --> 01:07:59,316
Everything that was alive in
in the hearts of young people,

679
01:08:00,274 --> 01:08:03,582
sinks into the dirty swamp of nationalism.

680
01:08:05,052 --> 01:08:07,154
They're all sacrificed.

681
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:21,279
There's no party for us anymore,
Rosa. We ought to resign.

682
01:08:21,625 --> 01:08:25,148
Oh, Clara. Do you intend to
separate from humankind too?

683
01:08:26,978 --> 01:08:29,971
- I've thought of that too.
- And me.

684
01:08:32,087 --> 01:08:34,471
But who'll do the work if we don't?

685
01:08:45,601 --> 01:08:47,452
First, set up Mehring with the magazine.

686
01:08:49,656 --> 01:08:51,554
Liebknecht will try to organise meetings.

687
01:08:54,091 --> 01:08:57,526
I'll send telegrams to party
agents in the opposition.

688
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:02,944
Your only answer will be
pretexts and cowardly denial.

689
01:09:07,825 --> 01:09:09,795
They've spoiled the joy
of Christmas for us, too.

690
01:09:15,788 --> 01:09:18,133
This is for you, yes, here you are.

691
01:09:23,628 --> 01:09:26,720
And this is for me. For you? No.

692
01:09:30,549 --> 01:09:31,413
Oh, Mimi.

693
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:36,079
A book should be written
about these events,

694
01:09:36,469 --> 01:09:39,066
which would affect the whole of
humanity like the blow of a club.

695
01:10:04,754 --> 01:10:06,272
Our time's running out, Mimi.

696
01:10:08,887 --> 01:10:09,952
Quickly, if you may.

697
01:10:10,653 --> 01:10:12,768
Ask Miss Jacob to notify
the lawyer immediately.

698
01:10:14,156 --> 01:10:18,160
Don't forget Mimi. She
has her favourite chair.

699
01:10:23,506 --> 01:10:28,326
Don't worry Mimi, I'm going to write
an anti-war treatise in the castle.

700
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:32,298
And clear accounts with
those accursed cowards.

701
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:44,992
- Take them off.
- I've already been inspected today.

702
01:10:44,993 --> 01:10:46,000
It's best to be sure.

703
01:10:50,336 --> 01:10:51,167
Faster than that.

704
01:11:00,352 --> 01:11:01,048
Keep going.

705
01:11:08,404 --> 01:11:09,123
And the rest.

706
01:11:18,464 --> 01:11:21,389
Turn around and bend over.

707
01:11:24,715 --> 01:11:25,654
Cell 45.

708
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:44,262
You'll get your belongings tomorrow.

709
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:47,168
- What about my nightgown?
- Tomorrow.

710
01:11:48,264 --> 01:11:51,284
- I could at least have a book.
- The censors have to look at them first.

711
01:12:23,406 --> 01:12:26,103
House, houses.

712
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:33,548
- What 's smoke ...
- Smoke.

713
01:12:36,991 --> 01:12:40,716
Here are Ala and Ola.

714
01:12:42,054 --> 01:12:46,209
Ala stands and Ola stands.

715
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:49,773
You're doing really well, Nana.

716
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:54,947
Ola's doll stands.

717
01:12:55,835 --> 01:13:00,215
What are you doing here? You
should be back at work in the kitchen.

718
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:11,055
- How are you?
- Reading's more important than potatoes.

719
01:13:11,604 --> 01:13:14,586
- You're just indulging Nana.
- I want to be a teacher.

720
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:20,726
- Are you on your feet?
- Not today. Could you take care of my letters?

721
01:13:23,951 --> 01:13:30,017
So many! Wouldn't it be better
for them to be answered verbally?

722
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:33,756
It's fun when they come, but
letters must still be answered.

723
01:13:37,723 --> 01:13:39,412
Karl! How did you get here?

724
01:13:39,828 --> 01:13:43,203
- Through the integrity of lawyers and MPs.
- Sit down.

725
01:13:48,784 --> 01:13:52,953
I brought a nightshirt,
comb, soap, eau de Cologne.

726
01:13:53,592 --> 01:13:58,000
The little things of life. Sonja
got them, regards from everyone.

727
01:13:58,786 --> 01:14:02,327
Mathilde's taking care of Mimi, Leo's taking
care of the organization, I'm campaigning.

728
01:14:03,173 --> 01:14:05,745
However, I'll be in the military
service in France for a while.

729
01:14:06,164 --> 01:14:09,028
- What about integrity?
- It's difficult.

730
01:14:09,956 --> 01:14:12,233
There are dates when I have leave.

731
01:14:12,724 --> 01:14:15,796
- There are less and less of us.
- Leo's handling it.

732
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:19,505
I'm worried about him, he can't get
any food coupons without a passport.

733
01:14:19,506 --> 01:14:22,689
- Mathilde can help him.
- Leo pretends he doesn't need help.

734
01:14:24,154 --> 01:14:27,210
- You have to trick him.
- Mathilde can manage it.

735
01:14:29,438 --> 01:14:35,416
You need this for the article.
Sonja will come next time.

736
01:14:36,502 --> 01:14:37,316
Any message for Leo?

737
01:14:41,874 --> 01:14:44,350
- How did you ...
- I've had a lot of time to practice.

738
01:14:46,006 --> 01:14:49,029
- Do you have any name in mind for the group?
- Spartacus.

739
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:54,291
Is that a slave in history
or a woman who's resisted?

740
01:14:54,829 --> 01:14:57,849
Ask Clara.  She invents someone
in case of emergency.

741
01:15:00,629 --> 01:15:01,494
Five more minutes.

742
01:15:04,282 --> 01:15:09,218
- Have you heard anything about Clara?
- We got some bad news.

743
01:15:10,127 --> 01:15:13,811
The house is guarded, the phone
is monitored, mail is opened.

744
01:15:14,658 --> 01:15:17,665
Comrades in the village go into war.

745
01:15:18,403 --> 01:15:20,536
Even the old and unfit for service.

746
01:15:25,174 --> 01:15:26,917
- Was I supposed to hide that from you?
- No!

747
01:15:30,017 --> 01:15:31,291
I hate it that I'm shielded away.

748
01:15:35,924 --> 01:15:39,032
I am of course sick, I shake all over.

749
01:15:40,485 --> 01:15:42,699
Sometimes I feel
I'm not a real person,

750
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:46,564
but a bird or an animal in
unsuccessful human guise.

751
01:15:48,327 --> 01:15:52,521
Deep inside, I'm more at home among the
bumblebees in a garden or a meadow,

752
01:15:52,879 --> 01:15:55,363
than in a party conference.

753
01:15:56,813 --> 01:16:00,547
I can tell you this. You do not immediately
smell the betrayal of socialism.

754
01:16:01,798 --> 01:16:05,580
But I hope to die in my rightful place,
fighting on the street or in prison.

755
01:16:07,201 --> 01:16:11,915
However, my innermost self belongs
more to fieldmice than comrades.

756
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,769
Are you really Polish?

757
01:16:15,353 --> 01:16:16,017
Yes.

758
01:16:17,263 --> 01:16:21,589
Why are you in Germany,
then? Or am I too curious?

759
01:16:22,854 --> 01:16:27,081
I thought Germany's social democracy
was a strong international force.

760
01:16:28,747 --> 01:16:32,350
- You don't think that any more?
- Have you heard the phrase,

761
01:16:32,350 --> 01:16:35,692
- "Proletarians of all countries, unite"?
- Yes.

762
01:16:36,310 --> 01:16:39,199
Now it reads: "Join together in peace,"

763
01:16:39,200 --> 01:16:41,920
"and cut each others throats in war."

764
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:44,296
That doesn't make sense.

765
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,268
- What's your name?
- Elisabeth.

766
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,472
Could you send a letter for me?

767
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,326
- For you, I'd do it.
- Thank you.

768
01:17:26,777 --> 01:17:27,187
Lulu!

769
01:17:31,456 --> 01:17:32,284
Oh, how funny!

770
01:17:34,865 --> 01:17:38,977
Don't fret, Lulu. I know that
your mind is full of sorrows,

771
01:17:39,883 --> 01:17:43,430
but after all, it's only sighing over all that
goes wrong in the history of the world.

772
01:17:44,275 --> 01:17:47,533
You were right. The Socialists have failed miserably.

773
01:17:47,985 --> 01:17:50,633
Ebert and Scheidemann pushed through war loans.

774
01:17:50,998 --> 01:17:53,764
But we can't just sink down
to moan about the present.

775
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:58,573
People hardly have any food. You
might not be quite up to date.

776
01:17:58,951 --> 01:18:01,634
It's irrational to rage against
the whole of humanity.

777
01:18:04,088 --> 01:18:04,759
My garden.

778
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:08,506
The only action I've taken in
prison is making this garden.

779
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:12,152
See how the violet seeds are doing.

780
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:17,479
I like to sit there, too.

781
01:18:20,283 --> 01:18:23,552
Lulu. It seems to me
that this whole madhouse,

782
01:18:24,186 --> 01:18:26,092
this moral mire in which we now crawl,

783
01:18:26,843 --> 01:18:30,754
can in an instant, as if by magic,
be changed into something great.

784
01:18:33,992 --> 01:18:36,639
Dear friend, don't live in this
country like a trodden frog.

785
01:18:38,265 --> 01:18:41,119
I came to cheer you up and
you're the one doing it.

786
01:18:42,853 --> 01:18:45,924
Embracing is forbidden. Your hour is up.

787
01:18:47,174 --> 01:18:48,328
Filthy spy!

788
01:18:50,653 --> 01:18:52,071
What else can you expect from that?

789
01:18:57,367 --> 01:18:58,115
Elisabeth!

790
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:06,498
- Have you read the book to the end?
- I cried three times over.

791
01:19:07,751 --> 01:19:09,278
It's always nice to read something.

792
01:19:10,868 --> 01:19:13,307
- Could you lend me something else?
- Sure.

793
01:19:15,487 --> 01:19:18,926
How about Tolstoy. Have you heard of him?

794
01:19:20,439 --> 01:19:24,474
The greatest of the Russian
writers. What can I give you...

795
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:30,029
You'll like this.

796
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:34,045
Everything from Russia
is prohibited now.

797
01:19:35,279 --> 01:19:37,048
You shouldn't care about such nonsense.

798
01:19:38,977 --> 01:19:40,583
Anna Karenina.

799
01:19:54,494 --> 01:19:57,614
It's painful to enjoy such beauty alone.

800
01:19:59,059 --> 01:20:03,354
I'd like to shout over the wall: please
note today is certainly a wonderful day.

801
01:20:03,986 --> 01:20:06,595
Do not forget it. In the middle of your hurry,

802
01:20:06,597 --> 01:20:10,177
lift up your heads, look
up at the silver clouds.

803
01:20:11,874 --> 01:20:16,632
Feel the air, which the flowers in
the linden trees breathe passionately,

804
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:21,133
behold the days of luxury and beauty,

805
01:20:22,149 --> 01:20:24,109
because today will never return.

806
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:28,249
It was given to you like a
rose that has come full bloom,

807
01:20:28,250 --> 01:20:32,170
and expects you to pick it
and press it to your lips.

808
01:20:58,008 --> 01:20:59,682
There's not enough room for books here.

809
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:02,503
No light for plants.

810
01:21:03,107 --> 01:21:05,729
Books can be stored
in the adjacent cell.

811
01:21:06,925 --> 01:21:09,625
- How do I get them from there?
- Knock on the door.

812
01:21:10,977 --> 01:21:13,624
Or make a request to the commandant.

813
01:21:37,122 --> 01:21:37,735
Mail.

814
01:21:40,095 --> 01:21:40,656
Thank you.

815
01:24:56,526 --> 01:25:02,903
It's unbelievable. First Mimi died, and now ...

816
01:25:03,079 --> 01:25:03,930
Don't, Luise.

817
01:25:07,518 --> 01:25:08,261
I can't ...

818
01:25:20,004 --> 01:25:24,704
- If nobody's talking, the visit will be suspended.
- No, please don't.

819
01:25:27,060 --> 01:25:28,808
Should I tell you something?

820
01:25:45,147 --> 01:25:46,962
All kinds of things happen to me,

821
01:25:49,523 --> 01:25:54,498
but when something happens to
someone else, I lose all my strength.

822
01:26:04,449 --> 01:26:08,530
Sonitshka, I had a
painful experience here.

823
01:26:09,992 --> 01:26:12,471
One day, a cart loaded with
sacks drove into the courtyard.

824
01:26:13,860 --> 01:26:17,675
The load was so big that the
oxen couldn't get through the gate.

825
01:26:19,487 --> 01:26:24,934
A soldier, the brute, was beating them,

826
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:26,232
until one began to bleed.

827
01:26:26,643 --> 01:26:29,798
After unloading, the animals stood silent, exhausted.

828
01:26:31,395 --> 01:26:37,346
There was the expression of a
child with eyes ready to cry.

829
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:40,897
I stood near the animal
and it looked at me.

830
01:26:42,173 --> 01:26:45,454
Tears flowed from my eyes.
They were its tears.

831
01:26:46,928 --> 01:26:51,940
When I saw its silent pain
it reverberated in me,

832
01:26:54,140 --> 01:26:58,804
as if in front of your beloved brother.

833
01:27:00,733 --> 01:27:02,503
We both stand here in silence.

834
01:27:03,752 --> 01:27:07,428
It's a common pain, helplessness, yearning.

835
01:27:09,941 --> 01:27:13,830
Sonitshka dear, stay calm and happy.

836
01:27:14,660 --> 01:27:16,261
Life must be accepted as it is.

837
01:27:18,073 --> 01:27:22,013
Without being discouraged I probably
smile bravely. In spite of everything.

838
01:27:36,235 --> 01:27:39,817
There's a visitor from Berlin,
Mrs Sonja Liebknecht.

839
01:27:48,879 --> 01:27:49,676
Sonitshka.

840
01:27:50,707 --> 01:27:53,562
I know you suffer from the
fact that the years roll on,

841
01:27:54,910 --> 01:27:55,842
without any room to live.

842
01:27:58,275 --> 01:28:02,404
But still we live on and
experience it all.

843
01:28:04,241 --> 01:28:07,070
Sometimes I think that the
war will go on forever,

844
01:28:08,501 --> 01:28:10,270
and you and Karl will never be free.

845
01:28:13,475 --> 01:28:17,308
I want you to drown
in the ectasy of life.

846
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,871
I'll defend your right
to do so, unwaveringly.

847
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:28,506
First, we'll see the old
world sink little by little.

848
01:28:30,078 --> 01:28:32,461
Maybe it'll all sink away forever.

849
01:28:33,906 --> 01:28:36,010
I think about the story of the heroic mole.

850
01:28:38,308 --> 01:28:42,707
It digs and digs until its
whole reality is hollow.

851
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:43,653
Look.

852
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:48,846
A country mole succeeds in reaching
the light even in a prison yard.

853
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:40,482
Germany is a parliamentary
democracy beginning from today.

854
01:29:42,809 --> 01:29:45,332
The Social Democrats have
been voted into the government.

855
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:49,058
The new government has presented
a Peace and Ceasefire request,

856
01:29:49,258 --> 01:29:51,351
to the American president.

857
01:29:57,070 --> 01:30:01,676
This means a defeat and surrender for Germany.

858
01:30:03,276 --> 01:30:06,625
You can read about it in
the papers, there's one each.

859
01:30:19,074 --> 01:30:21,550
Has your wish come true now, Dr Luxemburg?

860
01:30:24,326 --> 01:30:29,087
Your party's in power.  That's what
you've been waiting for, for 20 years.

861
01:30:30,565 --> 01:30:32,652
I'm afraid of Ebert abusing his power,

862
01:30:32,981 --> 01:30:35,090
and deceiving the workers again.

863
01:30:55,536 --> 01:30:57,383
- Hello.
- Hello, Director.

864
01:31:01,595 --> 01:31:04,719
Political prisoners were pardoned on October 12th.

865
01:31:05,514 --> 01:31:07,586
I should've been released three weeks ago.

866
01:31:09,050 --> 01:31:11,629
Amnesty only applies to prisoners
who've been convicted.

867
01:31:13,173 --> 01:31:14,479
You're in preventative detention.

868
01:31:14,999 --> 01:31:17,486
The government's afraid of me
speaking publicly against the war.

869
01:31:18,976 --> 01:31:22,470
The war's over.  What does the
government need to be protected from?

870
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:26,046
- Revolution.
- Liebknecht was released two weeks ago.

871
01:31:26,047 --> 01:31:27,638
One radical is enough for them.

872
01:31:30,828 --> 01:31:33,579
I can't exempt you
until I get a warrant.

873
01:31:37,773 --> 01:31:38,741
Can I ask one thing?

874
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:43,278
Do you love or hate Germans?

875
01:31:45,114 --> 01:31:47,648
Germans are like children
who don't know freedom.

876
01:31:48,718 --> 01:31:51,319
Director, Breslau is far from
the centre of operations,

877
01:31:52,032 --> 01:31:55,490
When an army demobs, trains and
phone lines get overloaded.

878
01:31:56,992 --> 01:31:59,098
Couldn't you contact Berlin
and ask them about me?

879
01:32:00,005 --> 01:32:01,413
You've been a model prisoner.

880
01:32:02,667 --> 01:32:04,892
You haven't created any disturbances.

881
01:32:06,416 --> 01:32:09,884
How did you get your name "Bloody Rosa"?

882
01:32:10,647 --> 01:32:13,953
Frankly, your patience has surprised me.

883
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:20,239
I've kept the forces inside me
alive, waiting for this moment.

884
01:32:21,696 --> 01:32:23,368
To make sure I'm returned to my rights.

885
01:32:24,786 --> 01:32:26,279
Freedom is my right!

886
01:32:45,505 --> 01:32:46,017
Rosa!

887
01:32:51,638 --> 01:32:54,170
You've taken care of me
so dearly for all these years.

888
01:32:57,845 --> 01:33:00,715
- God, what misery.
- You don't seem that healthy.

889
01:33:01,653 --> 01:33:03,996
Don't talk about me, I think there's
been enough talk about that already.

890
01:33:03,998 --> 01:33:06,754
- We can't go to your house yet.
- Why not?

891
01:33:07,664 --> 01:33:10,610
- I've been waiting to get home.
- You've got to be careful.

892
01:34:19,572 --> 01:34:20,886
We've gotten old.

893
01:34:25,032 --> 01:34:27,263
You can't see your wrinkles, Leo.

894
01:34:30,121 --> 01:34:32,124
Breslau was your ninth prison.

895
01:34:33,898 --> 01:34:36,193
That's one score I've beaten you on.

896
01:34:39,995 --> 01:34:40,936
Well, what's to be done?

897
01:34:42,985 --> 01:34:45,637
We've gotten the weight of
requisitioning from Leon's proposal.

898
01:34:46,351 --> 01:34:49,243
- Like Warsaw in 1906?
- Like that.

899
01:34:49,853 --> 01:34:54,349
The paper's called "Red Flag".
The first issue came yesterday.

900
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,941
You manage the delivery.

901
01:34:58,302 --> 01:35:01,554
Leo organises it, but it's
still at your disposal.

902
01:35:02,077 --> 01:35:05,058
I'll go to the people on the
street, but of course still write.

903
01:35:05,845 --> 01:35:07,157
Can I see today's one?

904
01:35:18,604 --> 01:35:19,524
Will we succeed?

905
01:35:20,595 --> 01:35:23,066
We're not as fast as the
young radicals want.

906
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:25,810
Don't talk like a grandfather.

907
01:35:29,526 --> 01:35:31,932
You see revolutionaries. Yet
they're just obedient soldiers.

908
01:35:32,454 --> 01:35:37,726
If we'd won the war,
they still would be.

909
01:35:38,676 --> 01:35:42,837
- Isn't their obedience enough?
- You've been gone a while.

910
01:35:43,353 --> 01:35:45,114
Spartacus is not as powerful
as we'd like it to be.

911
01:35:47,913 --> 01:35:52,180
People change, soldiers change.
And Germany changes.

912
01:35:58,742 --> 01:36:03,644
It's wonderful to have a real bed.
I'm sure I'll have a good night's sleep.

913
01:36:27,854 --> 01:36:32,844
In the beginning,  I collected a small,
courageous band of victimised comrades,

914
01:36:32,844 --> 01:36:36,080
and hurled it against the fervour of war.

915
01:36:36,301 --> 01:36:40,985
We were shouted down,
persecuted and imprisoned.

916
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:44,633
When I said out loud what no-one
else at that time dared to say,

917
01:36:44,633 --> 01:36:52,125
namely that the German political and
military leadership was guilty of war.

918
01:36:52,494 --> 01:36:56,620
I was branded a traitor who called
for the destruction of Germany.

919
01:36:57,622 --> 01:36:58,880
It would have been easier for us,

920
01:36:59,342 --> 01:37:03,333
if we'd remained silent or joined
in with the jingoistic chorus.

921
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:08,852
When we raised our voice again
to show the German people,

922
01:37:10,512 --> 01:37:15,617
the only path to freedom
and peace lay in disaster,

923
01:37:15,617 --> 01:37:19,824
the same people who had
suppressed the truth, and us,

924
01:37:19,825 --> 01:37:24,914
once again began their old
campaign of lies and slander.

925
01:37:25,502 --> 01:37:27,032
Rage and shout!

926
01:37:27,450 --> 01:37:33,144
We follow the revolution and
the direct path of socialism!

927
01:37:34,286 --> 01:37:39,655
The great task for which we have
prepared so long is now needed.

928
01:37:40,377 --> 01:37:42,075
The revolution is here!

929
01:37:43,173 --> 01:37:46,716
We don't want to make a road to violence,

930
01:37:47,304 --> 01:37:50,891
or bloodshed, as our opponents believe.

931
01:37:51,712 --> 01:37:55,238
We call upon the revolutionary
readiness, the assembly of forces,

932
01:37:55,239 --> 01:38:01,124
to take into our hands the
rebuilding of the world!

933
01:38:01,823 --> 01:38:05,323
Either we sink back into the mire of the past,

934
01:38:06,011 --> 01:38:09,411
or continue to fight for mankind's release

935
01:38:09,412 --> 01:38:13,280
from the curse of slavery!

936
01:38:14,035 --> 01:38:20,437
Long live the world revolution! Spartacus lives!

937
01:38:21,155 --> 01:38:24,172
- You spoke like a preacher.
- But not against my conviction.

938
01:38:25,064 --> 01:38:27,661
I don't think we should cheer
ourselves, but criticise.

939
01:38:27,662 --> 01:38:32,699
Self-criticism doesn't lend wings to the
people. Now we need wings of inspiration!

940
01:38:33,263 --> 01:38:37,843
- You've got to strike while the iron's hot.
- Still, you shouldn't appear too sure.

941
01:38:38,737 --> 01:38:43,830
Remember that the bourgeoisie which has
been wounded is fighting for its life's blood.

942
01:38:44,618 --> 01:38:48,944
- Was my speech so ambiguous?
- It's a bit misleading.

943
01:38:50,133 --> 01:38:51,564
I'll write tomorrow's article on the way.

944
01:38:53,235 --> 01:38:54,382
We'll meet later.

945
01:38:57,393 --> 01:39:00,412
We're at the front of the biggest
task ever set for humanity.

946
01:39:05,834 --> 01:39:08,408
- Where's Karl staying tonight?
- He's visiting colleagues in Neukölln.

947
01:39:08,408 --> 01:39:11,428
I've got to see him! I
need tomorrow's article.

948
01:39:12,277 --> 01:39:15,626
- He'll send it tonight.
- Your blanket, Rosa!

949
01:39:17,658 --> 01:39:19,159
Rosa! Sandwiches!

950
01:39:28,424 --> 01:39:30,477
Tell me why I always go on,

951
01:39:31,990 --> 01:39:34,697
as if I never had the
slightest desire to live.

952
01:39:36,201 --> 01:39:37,315
Don't fool yourself.

953
01:39:40,010 --> 01:39:44,756
If you lived any other way
you wouldn't be any happier.

954
01:39:58,689 --> 01:40:01,711
- Papers.
- Okay, no need to worry.

955
01:40:03,778 --> 01:40:06,973
- What is it?
- Spartacists are fighting in Ullsteinin.

956
01:40:07,764 --> 01:40:11,170
They're being fortified
with the "Forward" magazine.

957
01:40:12,514 --> 01:40:15,120
- Did you know?
- I was afraid of this.

958
01:40:22,028 --> 01:40:22,865
Go through!

959
01:41:03,725 --> 01:41:07,312
- Don't go out there, they're shooting.
- I need to talk to them.

960
01:41:07,721 --> 01:41:10,177
This is not the place for a woman, Doctor.

961
01:41:10,408 --> 01:41:13,360
Suppose that you succeed,
and Berlin is ours.

962
01:41:14,365 --> 01:41:19,491
What happens in East Prussia,
Hamburg, Bavaria, the Ruhr?

963
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:24,137
- The Bavarians will be roused last.
- We don't have a uniform organization!

964
01:41:24,299 --> 01:41:28,673
It has to be either the whole
of Germany or no-one!

965
01:41:29,620 --> 01:41:33,208
- It wasn't the whole of Russia and they still won.
- This isn't Russia.

966
01:41:34,099 --> 01:41:38,725
- Victory can only be reached with casualties.
- Your life shouldn't be the price!

967
01:41:40,320 --> 01:41:43,845
- This way, you can only lose!
- Karl Liebknecht says otherwise.

968
01:41:44,289 --> 01:41:47,335
Everybody against everybody without
order.  The forces are not ready!

969
01:41:47,719 --> 01:41:51,165
That's theory, Rosa. Reality
has its own dynamics.

970
01:41:51,167 --> 01:41:52,502
You're accelerating it artificially.

971
01:41:53,693 --> 01:41:58,715
There's no revolutionary majority
yet.  We need time, Karl.

972
01:41:59,522 --> 01:42:03,637
It's just a pointless bloodletting,
not a revolution!

973
01:42:03,639 --> 01:42:08,829
- The Proletariat marches, it's a revolution!
- This is nonsense!

974
01:42:08,261 --> 01:42:11,078
The Socialists also understand the reaction.

975
01:42:11,078 --> 01:42:14,575
Little fragments taken from articles!

976
01:42:14,577 --> 01:42:17,850
You always stand aside, you and
Leo, who always know everything!

977
01:42:17,851 --> 01:42:21,874
- We don't stand aside, but we're not fanatics!
- So I'm a fanatic?

978
01:42:25,358 --> 01:42:29,407
You'll have to answer to posterity
if you don't stand by me now!

979
01:42:30,463 --> 01:42:33,316
If we don't submit to your ideas
then we're traitors, eh?

980
01:42:46,754 --> 01:42:49,825
The typesetters are expecting a
leading article, they can fit three columns.

981
01:42:52,824 --> 01:42:57,031
Blood has flowed for four years in genocide.

982
01:42:58,076 --> 01:43:03,593
Now every drop must be carefully protected.

983
01:43:08,495 --> 01:43:12,153
- Why haven't I head anything from Luinen?
- He's probably scared of you.

984
01:43:15,067 --> 01:43:18,222
Before the political differences of
opinion didn't separate us.

985
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:21,340
Continue.

986
01:43:23,596 --> 01:43:26,081
The unhesitating revolutionary energy

987
01:43:26,928 --> 01:43:33,617
and humanity alone are the real spirit of socialism.

988
01:43:41,700 --> 01:43:43,332
The world must be revolutionised,

989
01:43:45,971 --> 01:43:49,629
but every shed tear wiped away,

990
01:43:51,230 --> 01:43:52,288
is an accusation.

991
01:43:54,797 --> 01:43:56,917
It's a poor human being,

992
01:43:56,918 --> 01:44:01,037
who carelessly mentions such crimes,

993
01:44:02,721 --> 01:44:03,701
that's a miserable coward.

994
01:44:15,415 --> 01:44:16,344
Quick, come here!

995
01:44:22,839 --> 01:44:26,414
That's the second time today.
She asks too much from herself.

996
01:44:37,017 --> 01:44:41,966
You'll have to go somewhere else, my husband's
diabetic and he can't take this strain. I'm sorry.

997
01:44:57,876 --> 01:45:01,049
We could go to Bremen. It's
safe, there's comrades there.

998
01:45:02,021 --> 01:45:03,122
When did you start becoming afraid?

999
01:45:05,738 --> 01:45:07,340
We didn't run away in Warsaw.

1000
01:45:07,991 --> 01:45:11,356
Don't get sentimental, Rosa. You're still needed.

1001
01:45:12,463 --> 01:45:16,018
What could happen? In the worst
case, a couple of years in the castle.

1002
01:45:21,034 --> 01:45:24,433
BEAT YOUR LEADER TO DEATH!
KILL LIEBKNECHT!

1003
01:45:27,450 --> 01:45:31,156
You're not packing me off to Berlin.
If Karl's staying here, so am I.

1004
01:45:37,449 --> 01:45:40,673
- They won't be looking for you here.
- Neukölln would suit me better.

1005
01:45:41,751 --> 01:45:42,517
There's a message for you.

1006
01:45:46,402 --> 01:45:48,951
Karl, All is forgiven. R.

1007
01:45:57,273 --> 01:46:00,777
We're not beaten yet, Rosa.
We'll endure and we'll win.

1008
01:46:01,878 --> 01:46:04,131
If only we're still around
when that happens, Karl.

1009
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:06,475
My article for tomorrow.

1010
01:46:09,661 --> 01:46:13,630
The waves hit high.  We are
accustomed to the risk of plunging,

1011
01:46:13,835 --> 01:46:18,909
into their crests but our ship runs
steadily and proudly to harbour.

1012
01:46:19,243 --> 01:46:23,052
Perhaps we won't be living there when
it reaches, but our programme will.

1013
01:46:23,681 --> 01:46:27,066
It guides the world to free
mankind, in spite of everything.

1014
01:46:28,702 --> 01:46:29,682
Read the last sentences.

1015
01:46:33,660 --> 01:46:37,541
"Order reigns in Berlin." You stupid
henchmen. Your order is built on sand.

1016
01:46:38,091 --> 01:46:40,994
Tomorrow the revolution will already
raise itself with a rattle,

1017
01:46:41,321 --> 01:46:45,704
and announce with fanfare, to your
horror: I was, I am, I will be.

1018
01:46:46,618 --> 01:46:50,705
Could you play a little piano?
I went so long without music.

1019
01:47:34,720 --> 01:47:35,596
Is there anything to eat?

1020
01:47:41,589 --> 01:47:44,332
Someone's told them the
address. You have to get out.

1021
01:47:47,042 --> 01:47:49,973
- Where are you going to go, Bremen or Frankfurt?
- Neukölln.

1022
01:47:50,190 --> 01:47:53,440
The paper must go on. We'll show the
comrades we're not going to be silenced.

1023
01:47:57,010 --> 01:47:58,173
- May I?
- Please, comrade.

1024
01:48:02,467 --> 01:48:03,222
Take care of yourself, my treasure.

1025
01:48:07,841 --> 01:48:08,606
And you, Rosa.

1026
01:48:40,154 --> 01:48:44,005
- Over there, the old whore!
- And the cavalier!

1027
01:48:44,283 --> 01:48:46,616
Spartacists!

1028
01:49:41,539 --> 01:49:42,402
Are you Mrs Rosa Luxemburg?

1029
01:49:46,195 --> 01:49:49,763
- You should be, according to your picture.
- If you say so.

1030
01:49:51,411 --> 01:49:53,769
You'll probably refuse to make a statement.

1031
01:49:55,836 --> 01:49:59,296
- Depends what you ask for.
- Your impudence is not acceptable here, Dr Luxemburg.

1032
01:50:00,814 --> 01:50:05,402
We are a state authority,
not your crippled allies.

1033
01:50:08,091 --> 01:50:10,231
History is proving the opposite.

1034
01:50:12,641 --> 01:50:13,851
Aren't you going to lock me up?

1035
01:51:03,172 --> 01:51:05,626
- Where are you from?
- Bremen.

1036
01:51:08,003 --> 01:51:09,452
- Got any brothers or sisters?
- Yes.

1037
01:51:10,276 --> 01:51:11,510
You're not allowed to talk to me.

1038
01:51:15,226 --> 01:51:15,595
Come on.

1039
01:52:32,845 --> 01:52:33,506
Don't shoot.

1040
01:56:29,686 --> 01:56:31,852
Subbed by Badge
