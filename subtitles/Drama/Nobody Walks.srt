1
00:01:46,705 --> 00:01:49,674
Listen. Um,

2
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:52,555
I had a great time sitting
next to you on the plane.

3
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:04,348
Silver Lake, right?

4
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,816
Every morning, as I drive away,

5
00:03:38,817 --> 00:03:40,651
I am reaching back for you.

6
00:03:40,652 --> 00:03:42,553
It is a helpless feeling,

7
00:03:42,554 --> 00:03:44,822
this wishing, this wanting,

8
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,858
this knowing you will arrive...

9
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,830
just minutes after I have gone.

10
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,800
Well, I thought that
was really freakin' good.

11
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,870
All right. All in favor
of including this piece...

12
00:03:57,871 --> 00:04:00,542
in our spring issue,
raise your hand.

13
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:05,442
Nearly unanimous.

14
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:08,079
And our author, Kolt.

15
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,750
Sylvia Plath would be proud.

16
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,963
Congratulations.

17
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:27,937
Thanks, dude.

18
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,937
Hi.

19
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,037
Hey.

20
00:04:33,038 --> 00:04:36,441
- Um, hello. I'm Martine.
- Hello.

21
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,442
Hey. Hi.

22
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,009
I'm Peter.

23
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,009
Let me grab this for you.
Come on in.

24
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,078
Thanks.

25
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,886
Julie can't wait to meet you.

26
00:04:47,886 --> 00:04:50,456
What's making you feel
so powerless?

27
00:04:51,456 --> 00:04:54,826
I'm way too afraid
to even approach a woman...

28
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,661
that might be on
my intellectual level.

29
00:04:56,662 --> 00:04:58,696
I know what you're gonna say.

30
00:04:58,697 --> 00:05:01,367
It's not 'cause
I'm afraid she'll reject me.

31
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:03,867
I'm afraid I'll reject her.

32
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:06,507
Okay.
Why is that?

33
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:12,443
You know, a lot of smart women
think too much to look good...

34
00:05:12,444 --> 00:05:14,815
and talk too much to fuck well.

35
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:19,386
I feel like such an asshole
saying these things to a woman.

36
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:22,791
I do get what
you're saying, actually.

37
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,226
'Cause the movie
comes out this week.

38
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:29,826
Everyone's acting like I'm supposed
to be excited, but I fucking hate it.

39
00:05:29,827 --> 00:05:32,098
And I wish I could say it looks nothing
like the script I handed them,

40
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:36,133
but they didn't change
a goddamn line.

41
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:38,503
I just wrote something
that isn't very good.

42
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,972
We're gonna need to stop.

43
00:05:40,973 --> 00:05:43,107
Don't do this to me, Julie.

44
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:45,547
I will see you on Wednesday.

45
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,849
There's a lot of life that'll come
out with the sound. There's...

46
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:26,218
You know,
like the bug's footsteps,

47
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,686
or maybe his breath.

48
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:31,756
You know, what would it sound like if
you could hear the bug's heart beat?

49
00:06:31,757 --> 00:06:34,859
Or, like, heartache.
What would that sound like?

50
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,626
You know?

51
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:40,597
Yeah. All right.
I think this'll be fun.

52
00:06:40,598 --> 00:06:43,071
Yeah.
I'm really excited.

53
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:49,106
Thank you so much for putting
aside time to do this with me.

54
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:52,107
Absolutely.

55
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:52,477
So you're working on, like,
a big studio movie right now?

56
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,912
I am, yeah.
They're not picture-locked yet.

57
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:58,718
So you're in luck.

58
00:06:59,718 --> 00:07:03,653
Hey, Peter, is this a
take-from-the-fruit-bowl night?

59
00:07:03,654 --> 00:07:05,823
Martine, this is Kolt.
Kolt, Martine.

60
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,824
Hi.

61
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,191
Hey.

62
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:10,828
What is a
take-from-the-fruit-bowl night?

63
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,763
Oh, it just means that everyone's
on their own for dinner.

64
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,901
Nobody's taken responsibility
as of yet.

65
00:07:17,168 --> 00:07:19,093
That's a maybe?

66
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,093
Hey, David.

67
00:07:41,093 --> 00:07:43,762
Oh, hey, Kolt.

68
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:46,031
Hey.

69
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:48,069
I'm just getting out of here.

70
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:53,206
Crazy plans?

71
00:07:54,206 --> 00:07:56,974
Just finishing up
some things for Peter.

72
00:07:56,975 --> 00:07:58,708
How about you?

73
00:07:58,709 --> 00:08:00,912
Lots of homework?

74
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:04,983
Not really. I already did this
history thing that's due Friday.

75
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:07,886
Well, it's good
not to procrastinate.

76
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,653
Yeah.

77
00:08:09,654 --> 00:08:13,958
I do anyway sometimes though.
Procrastinate.

78
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,028
Oh, yeah. Of course. I'm giving
you advice I can't take, so...

79
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,673
Eating bark in a tree.

80
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,308
Slow or fast?

81
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,909
Fast.

82
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,881
Wind, and also sand
blowing in the wind.

83
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:39,316
Sounds that only ants hear.

84
00:08:39,317 --> 00:08:42,085
Ah, need to be more specific. You know what?
We'll come back to it.

85
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:44,057
Okay, gasping.

86
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,591
Sticky stuff.

87
00:08:47,592 --> 00:08:49,359
Bowling pins.

88
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,362
Blood on pavement.

89
00:08:51,363 --> 00:08:53,864
- Got it.
- Really?

90
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:55,000
Hey, come on.

91
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,234
An old train.

92
00:08:58,235 --> 00:09:02,174
Okay. Um, bodies rubbing
up against each other.

93
00:09:03,174 --> 00:09:05,109
Okay.
So people having sex?

94
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,080
Yes. But not like, "Uh, uh, uh."

95
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,015
Okay.
Good to know.

96
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,259
Hi, Dad.

97
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,696
Hey, bud.

98
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,696
Hey.

99
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:26,797
Hi.

100
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,798
Is she coming to eat?
Where is she?

101
00:09:26,798 --> 00:09:29,133
Jet lag.

102
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,134
Is it gonna work out?

103
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:31,167
I think so, yeah.

104
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,168
She's really sweet.

105
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:32,936
Good.

106
00:09:32,937 --> 00:09:35,140
I think
she's really talented too.

107
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,308
Hey, who is in the pool house?

108
00:09:38,309 --> 00:09:40,411
Her name is Martine,

109
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:43,180
and she is a friend
of my friend Miriam's,

110
00:09:43,181 --> 00:09:44,749
and she needed Daddy's help.

111
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,651
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

112
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,652
My poem got into lit mag.

113
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:50,186
Sweetness, that's fantastic.

114
00:09:50,187 --> 00:09:52,057
- Did you call your dad?
- Not yet.

115
00:09:52,058 --> 00:09:54,691
Well, you know, he wrote poems
before he wrote songs.

116
00:09:54,692 --> 00:09:56,961
And maybe one day, he will
publish some of those poems,

117
00:09:56,962 --> 00:09:59,998
and he can buy us a hot tub.

118
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:53,748
Wanna get that?

119
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:53,117
Mm-mmm. No.

120
00:10:53,118 --> 00:10:56,118
- You sure?
- Yeah. One of the kids will get it.

121
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,288
No, they won't.

122
00:10:58,289 --> 00:11:00,423
They always let it
go to the machine.

123
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:03,259
And you never
check the machine.

124
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,797
I'm coming. I'm coming.

125
00:11:06,798 --> 00:11:09,200
Hello?

126
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:12,201
Hey, Avi.

127
00:11:12,236 --> 00:11:15,442
No, I don't know where Sea Horse is.
Hold on. Let me check.

128
00:11:18,442 --> 00:11:21,077
Kolt!
It's Avi on line one.

129
00:11:21,078 --> 00:11:23,314
I don't want
to talk to Avi, Peter.

130
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,855
Okay. Why don't you
tell him that yourself?

131
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,788
Firm hand of a parent.

132
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,789
Oh, so good.

133
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,369
Nailed it.

134
00:11:44,369 --> 00:11:46,344
Get the arm in there.

135
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,344
I gotta wash my face.

136
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,278
What?

137
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,279
I have to wash my face.

138
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:58,415
All right,
the TV's going back on.

139
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:00,851
Them's the rules.

140
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,874
Hey, where you going?
Class is that way.

141
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,428
Oh, I'm not going.

142
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:20,265
You want a section? I don't read
Science, Finance or Sports.

143
00:13:21,265 --> 00:13:23,414
Yeah, I'll take Science.

144
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:41,587
So, um, how's it going
with David?

145
00:13:43,587 --> 00:13:45,221
Hmm?

146
00:13:45,222 --> 00:13:48,029
Oh. Um, it's complicated.

147
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,000
I mean, there's definitely
chemistry, you know,

148
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,570
but the age difference.

149
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,908
And he works for Peter, so...

150
00:14:02,908 --> 00:14:05,109
I think we're both just...

151
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,980
a little afraid of where
it could go, you know?

152
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,582
Well, it's good to be cautious.

153
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:17,590
You have plenty of time. We're
only, you know, 16.

154
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:21,682
I hate it when people say that.

155
00:14:43,682 --> 00:14:45,320
I don't know.
What do you think?

156
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,523
Look, sir, we don't need a pool cleaning.
The pool is clean.

157
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,524
I'm looking at it right now.

158
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:54,494
David.

159
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,461
No, you know what?

160
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,634
Just forget it.
You're crooks anyway.

161
00:15:02,634 --> 00:15:04,543
My assistant.
He's a good guy.

162
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,142
Dusty's been upset
about this dead lizard...

163
00:15:13,143 --> 00:15:15,113
that's been clogging
the drain for like a week now,

164
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,181
and I don't think
the issue's worth $600.

165
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:21,552
This is our guest, Martine.
She's the bug auteur.

166
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,488
It's nice to meet you.
Excuse me.

167
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,725
Love that guy.

168
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,060
Every time we don't have
a big job going on,

169
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:32,363
he just tries to fix
what's broken in life.

170
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,301
My life.

171
00:15:36,301 --> 00:15:38,604
Okay, what's next?
Chimes?

172
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:57,421
And that is the power
of directional microphones.

173
00:15:57,422 --> 00:15:59,322
They're kind of like
magic wands.

174
00:15:59,323 --> 00:16:01,130
Here, come on.
I want to show you something.

175
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,768
All right,
just lay down right here.

176
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,639
Keep the headphones on.

177
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:17,178
Close your eyes.

178
00:16:20,178 --> 00:16:22,178
You tell me,

179
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:23,814
what do you think
you're hearing?

180
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,815
All right?

181
00:16:23,815 --> 00:16:25,586
Okay.

182
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:43,133
I don't know.
It sounds like...

183
00:16:43,134 --> 00:16:45,739
a concert, but far away.

184
00:16:47,739 --> 00:16:49,505
It's the highway.

185
00:16:49,506 --> 00:16:51,175
With those mountains
in the back,

186
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,179
it echoes through
the entire canyon.

187
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:57,080
- Wanna do another one?
- Yeah.

188
00:16:57,081 --> 00:16:59,615
Close your eyes.

189
00:16:59,616 --> 00:17:01,096
Okay, what about this one?

190
00:17:12,096 --> 00:17:14,730
That sounds like wind
going through trees.

191
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:17,738
I'll buy that.

192
00:17:20,738 --> 00:17:22,311
Okay.

193
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:30,201
Tell me what you hear...
now.

194
00:17:59,676 --> 00:18:02,192
But what kind?

195
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:16,173
I'm tired.

196
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,873
Hey, buddy.

197
00:19:02,874 --> 00:19:05,510
Hey!
Ah, you looking to brawl?

198
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:09,979
You're Julie.
Wow! Can I hug you?

199
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:13,719
Yeah, let's hug.
I'm pro-hug.

200
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,720
I can't believe it.
I'm meeting you.

201
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:20,691
One of the original members of
Miriam's postfeminist wolf pack.

202
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,858
I've seen pictures
of you guys, like,

203
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:26,229
sitting around swimming pools
looking focused.

204
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,999
It-It seems like
it was an amazing time.

205
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,566
I don't know.

206
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,567
Buonasera.

207
00:19:29,567 --> 00:19:30,968
Ciao, guys.

208
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:34,537
- Hey, Kolt.
- Hi.

209
00:19:34,538 --> 00:19:36,239
Hi.

210
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,510
Hi. I really
like your jeans.

211
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,577
Thanks.

212
00:19:41,578 --> 00:19:42,913
Do they have zippers on them?

213
00:19:42,914 --> 00:19:46,749
Um, yeah, they...
they do.

214
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,719
Hey, you want to take off?

215
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,287
Uh, yeah, we should.

216
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:53,856
Um, he's taking me to
my friend's art opening.

217
00:19:53,857 --> 00:19:56,860
Yeah, I... I can't drive.

218
00:19:56,861 --> 00:19:58,428
I'm a New Yorker.

219
00:19:58,429 --> 00:20:01,265
I'm clinging
to that as my excuse.

220
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:03,366
- Can you drive?
- No.

221
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:06,702
No, not yet. But we will
be practicing very soon.

222
00:20:06,703 --> 00:20:07,605
Yes, we will.

223
00:20:07,605 --> 00:20:08,771
Okay.

224
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:08,605
Yeah.

225
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,441
- You hungry, Sea Horse?
- Not really.

226
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:14,644
Hey, remember. 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow. Actors.

227
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:16,279
Yes.
I will be there.

228
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,415
And, Julie, I'm sorry that we
didn't get a chance to talk.

229
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:19,783
- Oh, we will.
- Okay.

230
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:22,552
Julie, is it possible
to get my check?

231
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,557
Yes. I'm so sorry.
I'll be right back.

232
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:15,439
There is a
mammal that lays eggs.

233
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,017
Platypus, Avi!
Platypus.

234
00:21:26,017 --> 00:21:27,670
I gotta go.

235
00:22:15,432 --> 00:22:18,069
Thank you for coming
with me tonight.

236
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,429
No, thank you for bringing me.

237
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:45,694
Um...

238
00:22:45,695 --> 00:22:47,797
I don't think...

239
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:51,905
that I should
do this right now.

240
00:22:54,905 --> 00:22:55,971
Okay.

241
00:22:55,972 --> 00:22:59,675
I just...
I just got here.

242
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:01,978
And I'm here to work.

243
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:07,555
And I think it's smarter
to forgo this type of...

244
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,956
Anyway, this was really nice.

245
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:15,674
Really nice.

246
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,747
Ah!

247
00:24:10,748 --> 00:24:12,585
Ah.

248
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:16,152
Mmm.

249
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:18,153
Martine, you're alive.

250
00:24:16,153 --> 00:24:18,889
Doug. Hey.

251
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,890
Am I waking you up?

252
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,990
Um... God, no.

253
00:24:20,991 --> 00:24:23,860
I've been awake
for a couple hours already.

254
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,861
Everything going all right?

255
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,030
Yeah, it's going great.

256
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:33,636
Um, I haven't seen it yet.

257
00:24:33,637 --> 00:24:38,775
Um, but as soon as
I get my Internet,

258
00:24:38,776 --> 00:24:41,278
I'm gonna...

259
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,947
No. No, no, no, no.

260
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,048
Yeah, we'll definitely
finish on time.

261
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:49,288
Okay. All right.
Talk to you later.

262
00:24:51,288 --> 00:24:52,825
Okay.

263
00:24:54,825 --> 00:24:55,662
Okay.

264
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:58,894
Ugh.

265
00:24:58,895 --> 00:25:02,665
Hi. I'm...
I'm sorry I'm late.

266
00:25:02,666 --> 00:25:05,935
I, um... I couldn't find the
dialogue that I wrote.

267
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:07,737
That's okay.

268
00:25:07,738 --> 00:25:10,073
Let's, uh, make
a couple copies of this.

269
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:13,074
Hi. I'm Martine.

270
00:25:10,074 --> 00:25:13,643
Hi. Nice to meet you.

271
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,644
Thanks for coming, guys.

272
00:25:13,644 --> 00:25:15,245
Sure.

273
00:25:15,246 --> 00:25:16,022
Whoo. Okay.

274
00:25:26,022 --> 00:25:29,358
So the reviews are in.

275
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,595
Some great, some good. A few
really hostile ones, of course.

276
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:35,268
How are the reviews
making you feel?

277
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:39,202
I don't want to talk
about the reviews.

278
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:41,173
Okay.

279
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,741
I had a dream last night.

280
00:25:45,742 --> 00:25:48,612
Another one about
your grandmother?

281
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,613
No.

282
00:25:49,614 --> 00:25:52,683
It was about you.

283
00:25:53,683 --> 00:25:55,852
All right.

284
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,853
Am I allowed
to tell you about it?

285
00:25:55,853 --> 00:25:58,657
Of course.

286
00:26:00,657 --> 00:26:02,892
Um, I was on set,

287
00:26:02,893 --> 00:26:04,661
in the house that we shot in...

288
00:26:04,662 --> 00:26:06,997
that weird glass box
in the Valley...

289
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,734
and David Strathairn was eating
cereal out of a megaphone.

290
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,706
I had a break. Something drew
me to one of the bedrooms.

291
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:18,976
I opened the door...

292
00:26:20,644 --> 00:26:23,113
You were lying on the carpet,

293
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:26,650
and, um, you were all dressed up
in full lingerie.

294
00:26:26,651 --> 00:26:29,419
You know, lacy bra,
thong, stockings.

295
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:33,823
Those things that you use to clip
your stockings to your panties.

296
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:35,692
- I don't remember what they're called.
- Garters.

297
00:26:35,693 --> 00:26:38,862
I was excited.
I walked over,

298
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,664
started to touch you,
softly at first,

299
00:26:41,665 --> 00:26:45,402
and then... more.

300
00:26:45,403 --> 00:26:48,672
You were just ignoring me. You were all
dressed up like you wanted to fuck,

301
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:50,009
but you were
totally unresponsive.

302
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:54,710
So I started talking to you.

303
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:56,746
What were you saying?

304
00:26:56,747 --> 00:26:58,981
I just said,
"Hey, baby. I'm here.

305
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:02,285
We're not done shooting, but they
don't need me. Do you need me?"

306
00:27:02,286 --> 00:27:04,988
You still didn't respond.
I started to get upset.

307
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:09,058
I was begging.
Which is not really my style.

308
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:14,968
I took my pants off. Because I just... I
just needed you to know that I was hard.

309
00:27:17,968 --> 00:27:20,707
And I looked at you
and I said, "I love you."

310
00:27:22,707 --> 00:27:25,344
And then we were fucking.
It was that easy.

311
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,844
Psst. Come over here.

312
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,012
What?

313
00:27:29,012 --> 00:27:30,880
I found it.

314
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,881
Where?

315
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,982
Right here.
On the ground.

316
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:37,223
- Is it safe?
- It's sticky.

317
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,924
Okay.
Um, I liked that.

318
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:44,328
Um... Uh...

319
00:27:45,328 --> 00:27:46,796
Ken.

320
00:27:46,797 --> 00:27:47,997
Ken. Yes.

321
00:27:47,998 --> 00:27:49,466
Um, I'm sorry.

322
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:54,037
Um, I want something
a little harder, I think.

323
00:27:54,038 --> 00:27:57,806
Like you're
a protective husband, um,

324
00:27:57,807 --> 00:28:01,480
but you're a little bit scared.

325
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,483
You're talking about
when I'm asking the question?

326
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:07,851
Yes.

327
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,488
Um, you're still
soft and scared.

328
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,156
Um, a little less blatant.

329
00:28:14,157 --> 00:28:18,094
Um, like... like... like you're
really asking the question.

330
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:21,964
But I'm asking the question
because I'm scared?

331
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:27,403
Right. Um,
but you're not, like,

332
00:28:27,404 --> 00:28:29,209
sitting in your fear.

333
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:36,312
Um, I just mean, like, um,

334
00:28:36,313 --> 00:28:40,018
y-your fear, um,
it doesn't hinder you.

335
00:28:41,018 --> 00:28:47,056
Like, you fear, yet you're
motivated by your fear.

336
00:28:47,057 --> 00:28:49,191
This is what happened
in the other scene.

337
00:28:49,192 --> 00:28:50,028
We did eight takes
of that, and...

338
00:28:51,028 --> 00:28:55,000
I have no idea what the
difference is between any of 'em.

339
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,102
Well, I think it's good
to just take adjustments.

340
00:28:59,103 --> 00:29:01,104
I'm not an actor who minds
taking adjustments,

341
00:29:01,105 --> 00:29:04,509
as long as a director
is actually saying something.

342
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:08,213
I mean, have you ever
worked with actors before?

343
00:29:10,213 --> 00:29:11,981
'Cause it seems like
your thing's bugs.

344
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:15,218
She used to take naked
photos of her boyfriend.

345
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,554
I googled you. I think
they're really beautiful.

346
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,956
Listen. We really
appreciate the help.

347
00:29:19,957 --> 00:29:22,257
All right, you're gettin' paid.
Why don't you do what she says?

348
00:29:22,258 --> 00:29:23,028
You're barely covering my gas.

349
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,564
And she's not
telling me to do anything.

350
00:29:33,904 --> 00:29:35,941
I'm sorry about that.

351
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,913
I'm sorry.

352
00:29:51,989 --> 00:29:53,292
You all right?

353
00:29:56,292 --> 00:29:59,095
Okay, I'm not even
that upset right now.

354
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:02,602
It's just, like...

355
00:30:04,602 --> 00:30:08,203
I'm sorry, Peter.

356
00:30:08,204 --> 00:30:10,573
I really didn't want
that to happen.

357
00:30:10,574 --> 00:30:13,375
What are you talking about?
You didn't do anything wrong.

358
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,580
That guy just didn't get it.

359
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,118
Ugh.

360
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,088
Hey. Hey.

361
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:27,359
Are you all right?

362
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:31,962
Is there something else
goin' on?

363
00:30:32,962 --> 00:30:35,964
Don't be so hard on yourself.

364
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:38,294
Thank you.

365
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,264
I heard something.
Did you hear something?

366
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:43,271
I think someone's outside.

367
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:51,108
It's David.

368
00:31:52,108 --> 00:31:56,179
Okay. Um, I should...
I should go.

369
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,082
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no. It's no trouble.

370
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,250
I don't even know why you're
wasting your time on this.

371
00:32:01,251 --> 00:32:03,152
I want to help.
It's, uh...

372
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:07,125
I think you're really someone
who's, uh, worth helping, so...

373
00:32:08,125 --> 00:32:10,065
Okay.

374
00:32:15,065 --> 00:32:17,666
Hey, brother.

375
00:32:17,667 --> 00:32:19,161
Hey, man.

376
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:46,461
Hey.

377
00:32:46,462 --> 00:32:48,232
Are you a free set of hands?

378
00:32:49,232 --> 00:32:51,534
Um, yeah.

379
00:32:51,535 --> 00:32:53,669
I'm a terrible cook though.

380
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:55,705
That's all right. Just chop
this parsley real quick,

381
00:32:55,705 --> 00:32:58,679
Okay.

382
00:32:55,706 --> 00:32:58,705
and then you can
get back to work.

383
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:04,614
Getting into it?

384
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:06,348
What?

385
00:33:06,349 --> 00:33:08,750
Are you getting
a lot of work done?

386
00:33:08,751 --> 00:33:11,720
Oh, yeah. Totally.
Completely.

387
00:33:11,721 --> 00:33:14,257
So much work, yeah.

388
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:18,326
You know, I just realized
I saw your work once.

389
00:33:18,327 --> 00:33:22,500
At Miriam's.
You were staying there, I think.

390
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:26,335
Oh, yeah.
She let me keep my, um,

391
00:33:26,336 --> 00:33:28,371
stuff there during the lawsuit.

392
00:33:28,372 --> 00:33:33,409
The lawsuit because your boyfriend
didn't want to be photographed?

393
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:36,245
Um, well, I guess he felt...

394
00:33:36,246 --> 00:33:40,684
that I manipulated him
into posing naked.

395
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:44,684
Ouch.

396
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:44,420
Yeah.

397
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,756
It was not awesome, no.

398
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:49,826
Um, but I learned a lot.

399
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,132
We don't have to
talk about this.

400
00:33:55,132 --> 00:33:57,732
So, you used to live
in New York?

401
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:01,104
I did, yeah.
Where do you live?

402
00:34:01,105 --> 00:34:04,874
I used to live in Hell's Kitchen
with my ex-boyfriend,

403
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:08,847
um, but I'm in Brooklyn now
with roommates.

404
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,180
Two roommates.

405
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:12,881
What are you, 23?

406
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:15,350
Yeah.

407
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:18,254
Twenty-three.

408
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:21,790
I was going to CalArts.

409
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,694
Sort of.

410
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,495
Why sort of?

411
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:30,899
Because my main gig
was being a girlfriend.

412
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,304
To Leroy,
who you will meet tonight.

413
00:34:35,304 --> 00:34:37,577
It's not a career
I'd recommend.

414
00:34:40,577 --> 00:34:42,578
It only took me,

415
00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,757
I don't know, 20 years
to get my life together.

416
00:34:53,757 --> 00:34:55,163
Just keep doing
what you're doing.

417
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:00,398
Mmm.

418
00:35:02,398 --> 00:35:03,599
All right, flee.
You're free.

419
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,268
No, this looks good.

420
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,599
Are you sure
you don't need more help?

421
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:08,438
I'll see you at 7:00.

422
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:11,449
Okay.

423
00:35:19,449 --> 00:35:22,517
When did you find out
you were gluten intolerant?

424
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,453
I was with, uh, Rod Stewart.

425
00:35:24,454 --> 00:35:26,923
He was, like, having a
dinner party or something.

426
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,491
He was talking about, you know,
this whole gluten thing.

427
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:32,261
I was like, "Well, tell me,
you know, what is gluten?"

428
00:35:32,262 --> 00:35:33,931
'Cause nobody really knows
what gluten...

429
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,964
Some... I don't know.

430
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,931
I know what it is.

431
00:35:35,965 --> 00:35:39,334
I don't know. Okay, I'm
in the bathroom, right?

432
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,335
And this was, like...

433
00:35:39,335 --> 00:35:42,971
Do you even know
who Peter Frampton is?

434
00:35:42,972 --> 00:35:45,242
These guys don't even know
who Peter Frampton is.

435
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:48,276
- You know Peter Frampton.
- I know who Peter Frampton is.

436
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:50,412
Well, he doesn't know. You
never heard of Peter Frampton.

437
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,349
No, I've never
heard of Peter Frampton.

438
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:56,419
But enough... enough about me.
It's not about me tonight.

439
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,221
To Julie.

440
00:35:58,222 --> 00:35:59,222
For giving me something...

441
00:35:59,922 --> 00:36:03,692
No. For giving me something
like home.

442
00:36:03,693 --> 00:36:05,895
Thank you.

443
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,896
Do you still live in a bus?

444
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,330
Sometimes, dude.

445
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:10,933
But hopefully not again this year.
I'm so sick of the road.

446
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:14,971
I'd like to say
thank you to Julie and Peter as well.

447
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:18,674
- I feel very lucky.
- Oh, it's our pleasure.

448
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:19,909
You're very welcome.

449
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:23,678
- Julie, you look beautiful.
- Mmm.

450
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:26,716
No, seriously. I mean, you look
about the same age as our daughter.

451
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:29,023
I don't, but thank you.

452
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,826
But you got this big guy over here, huh?
Mr. Handsome.

453
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:40,395
So, Peter, um,

454
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:44,567
I hear that your mixing board is
where my practice space used to be?

455
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:47,871
- Is that right?
- Well, the room was already soundproofed.

456
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:52,040
I'm glad someone's getting
some use out of it.

457
00:36:52,041 --> 00:36:53,976
- Peter just got a huge studio movie.
- You're kidding.

458
00:36:53,977 --> 00:36:56,745
So he's gonna be
working down in Hollywood.

459
00:36:56,746 --> 00:36:59,915
- Is that right?
- Amazing. That's great, man. That's totally great.

460
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:02,951
So, Martine,

461
00:37:02,952 --> 00:37:04,919
what do you make?

462
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,957
- What's the inquisition?
- I just want to know. What do you make?

463
00:37:07,958 --> 00:37:11,526
Right now, it's, um...
it's images of bugs.

464
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,731
- Bugs?
- A film, actually.

465
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:17,469
Peter is helping me
with the sound.

466
00:37:20,469 --> 00:37:21,938
When's your movie come out?

467
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:24,973
It... It actually
doesn't really come out.

468
00:37:24,974 --> 00:37:27,709
Well, it's gonna be running on
a loop on her first solo show.

469
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:29,944
A loop?

470
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:32,480
Which is at a gallery.

471
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,049
It's a big deal.

472
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,354
I don't know about big, but it's
some kind of deal, I guess.

473
00:37:38,355 --> 00:37:40,388
Come on.
Give him the spiel.

474
00:37:40,389 --> 00:37:42,726
It's so much fun to hear you
talk about it. Come on.

475
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:44,859
Oh, I don't know.

476
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,030
You've got a great thesis statement.
Leroy would appreciate it.

477
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:51,100
It's basically, uh,
humans versus nature,

478
00:37:51,101 --> 00:37:54,005
and, uh,
the personal versus the...

479
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:57,806
sort of intricate complexities
of community.

480
00:37:57,807 --> 00:38:00,642
Listen. At the end of it,
what you take away from it is...

481
00:38:00,643 --> 00:38:02,079
What is that e.e. cummings line?

482
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:07,353
"You can understand a poem
without knowing what it means."

483
00:38:10,353 --> 00:38:12,921
You shouldn't talk
about work around the table anyway.

484
00:38:12,922 --> 00:38:15,793
I learned that the hard way.

485
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:19,369
Uh, excuse me for a second.

486
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:26,003
So, baby girl,

487
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,803
your mom tells me that, uh,

488
00:38:28,804 --> 00:38:31,506
you had a poem accepted
to a literary magazine.

489
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,507
Two actually, yeah.

490
00:38:31,507 --> 00:38:33,942
Wow.

491
00:38:33,943 --> 00:38:36,145
Beautiful and smart, huh?

492
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,050
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

493
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,752
Tell me. Tell me.
It's amazing.

494
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:46,128
Yeah. I don't know. I didn't
think they were gonna like both of them.

495
00:38:53,896 --> 00:38:55,797
Just a second.

496
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:59,798
Are you okay?

497
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:59,634
Yeah, I'm fine.

498
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:03,439
You don't sound fine.

499
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,009
I remember once I was opening for
Wilco, and I couldn't remember a line.

500
00:39:06,009 --> 00:39:09,178
I sang, like, three songs...
I was just making up the words.

501
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,147
I swear to God, it was awful.

502
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,016
- Yeah.
- She's okay.

503
00:39:13,016 --> 00:39:15,184
What happened? I thought maybe
I offended you or something.

504
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:18,921
No. I'm sorry.
Um, I'm impossible to offend.

505
00:39:18,922 --> 00:39:20,057
I just, uh...

506
00:39:22,057 --> 00:39:26,060
Um, the tempeh was so good, I...
I forgot I'm allergic to it.

507
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,137
Well, good.
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

508
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,137
Hey, I have a question.

509
00:39:34,137 --> 00:39:36,504
Mm-hmm.

510
00:39:36,505 --> 00:39:42,477
Is Leroy ever gonna stop wearing
flannel shirts and Doc Martens?

511
00:39:42,478 --> 00:39:44,580
I mean, the guy's like
a cartoon character.

512
00:39:44,581 --> 00:39:47,783
Or like an Amish person.

513
00:39:47,784 --> 00:39:50,118
One outfit? Really?

514
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:52,053
I mean,
he does have the money...

515
00:39:52,054 --> 00:39:53,057
to get, like,
a variety of apparel.

516
00:39:55,057 --> 00:39:56,992
I think the only reason
why I'm asking is...

517
00:39:56,993 --> 00:40:01,663
I think I was legitimately confused
at dinner as to what year it was.

518
00:40:01,664 --> 00:40:03,132
So you wanna talk about dinner?

519
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,600
What?

520
00:40:05,601 --> 00:40:09,839
You wanna talk about your
little crush on our houseguest?

521
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,973
Excuse me?

522
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:14,974
What?
Did you not hear me?

523
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:14,843
No, I definitely heard you.

524
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,581
What are you talking about?

525
00:40:18,581 --> 00:40:21,216
What do you have an issue with?
I don't have an issue...

526
00:40:21,217 --> 00:40:24,186
when you bring your ex-husband over and
make googly-eyes at him all night.

527
00:40:24,187 --> 00:40:27,256
-Give me a break. We have a child together.
-What difference does that make?

528
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:28,824
I understand
you're attracted to her.

529
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:32,928
She's attractive.
I'm fucking attracted to her.

530
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:34,929
Okay. What...
What are we talking about?

531
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:42,014
Just don't embarrass me.

532
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:02,825
It just sounds really canned.

533
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,826
Canned?

534
00:41:02,826 --> 00:41:04,961
Yeah, like flat.

535
00:41:05,961 --> 00:41:07,997
Ear fatigue.

536
00:41:07,998 --> 00:41:10,165
It's an actual phenomenon.
Afflicts many.

537
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:12,869
I think your ears are tired.

538
00:41:13,869 --> 00:41:17,071
I think it's the echo.
Can we just take it out?

539
00:41:17,072 --> 00:41:19,978
I think we need a break.

540
00:41:21,978 --> 00:41:24,546
I think we need to
finish this scene.

541
00:41:24,547 --> 00:41:27,883
Honestly, I think if we come back to
it with fresh ears, it'll be better.

542
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:32,858
Peter, we really need to,
like, get through this.

543
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:37,628
Come on.

544
00:41:39,628 --> 00:41:41,898
Okay.

545
00:41:51,106 --> 00:41:53,975
- Listen. About, um...
- Yeah.

546
00:41:53,976 --> 00:41:56,044
the other day
in the pool house...

547
00:41:56,045 --> 00:41:57,946
Look. I'm really sorry.

548
00:41:57,947 --> 00:41:59,947
I...

549
00:41:57,947 --> 00:41:59,016
No, no. I, um...

550
00:42:00,016 --> 00:42:03,585
I find you
incredibly charming...

551
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:06,025
and intelligent and beautiful.

552
00:42:09,025 --> 00:42:11,027
I respect what you do.

553
00:42:12,027 --> 00:42:14,934
It makes me excited
about what I do.

554
00:42:18,934 --> 00:42:21,904
And I think I just got, uh...

555
00:42:21,905 --> 00:42:25,874
just carried away in that
mix of, uh, feelings.

556
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,977
Peter, it doesn't
have to be a big deal.

557
00:42:28,978 --> 00:42:32,881
We can just pretend
it never happened and...

558
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:35,125
Marriage is complicated.

559
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:45,828
I think we should just keep
working on this right now.

560
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,798
Yeah.

561
00:42:49,798 --> 00:42:52,168
Yeah. You're right.

562
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,333
I'm sorry. Your physical presence
this close to me is actually painful.

563
00:43:24,333 --> 00:43:27,870
This house is, like, um,
full of people.

564
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,139
Don't worry about it. This room
is completely soundproofed.

565
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:21,159
Vroom!

566
00:44:44,246 --> 00:44:46,080
Panino?

567
00:44:46,081 --> 00:44:47,793
Mmm.

568
00:44:57,793 --> 00:44:59,862
I don't know how to say it.

569
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,150
Hmm.

570
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:23,490
It's called a slip.

571
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,204
You ready for bed?

572
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,305
Where's my cookie?

573
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,306
What cookie?

574
00:46:17,306 --> 00:46:19,875
You ate the last cookie?

575
00:46:19,876 --> 00:46:21,876
No. There are no cookies left.

576
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:24,911
You suck.

577
00:46:21,911 --> 00:46:24,879
Are you coming to bed,
or are you gonna keep reading?

578
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,880
I'm gonna keep reading.

579
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,585
All right.

580
00:46:29,585 --> 00:46:32,187
My breath just happens to
smell like chocolate...

581
00:46:32,188 --> 00:46:34,083
chip cookies.

582
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,083
Mmm.

583
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:03,525
Oh, have more.

584
00:47:10,525 --> 00:47:12,929
Do you like Avi?

585
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:15,430
Well, yeah.

586
00:47:15,431 --> 00:47:17,466
I do.

587
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,536
I think he's really sweet.

588
00:47:21,536 --> 00:47:23,404
Do you like Avi?

589
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:26,241
I don't know.

590
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:29,977
I mean, he's certainly not like
my fantasy boyfriend or anything.

591
00:47:29,978 --> 00:47:31,279
Yeah.

592
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:33,314
Wow. Your dad...

593
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:37,986
seemed like
the fantasy boyfriend.

594
00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:39,356
But he wasn't.

595
00:47:41,356 --> 00:47:44,561
No. He wasn't.

596
00:47:46,561 --> 00:47:50,068
So then, how do you know when
you've found the right guy?

597
00:47:53,068 --> 00:47:55,169
I don't know that you do know.

598
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,943
I think you're just...
you're ready,

599
00:48:00,943 --> 00:48:03,414
and you pick one.

600
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:07,649
That's...
really depressing, Mom.

601
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,285
No, I... I don't think
it's depressing. I-I...

602
00:48:11,286 --> 00:48:16,094
I think... I think
people change and, uh...

603
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:21,629
and you keep changing and...

604
00:48:21,630 --> 00:48:25,168
you make a decision
to change together, or...

605
00:48:26,168 --> 00:48:28,409
you split up.

606
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:35,349
Um...

607
00:48:40,349 --> 00:48:42,484
See you in the morning.

608
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,485
Good night.

609
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,594
Sleep well.

610
00:49:27,030 --> 00:49:28,034
Hi.

611
00:49:31,034 --> 00:49:33,637
Hey, what are you doing here?

612
00:49:34,637 --> 00:49:37,372
Can I swim with you?

613
00:49:37,373 --> 00:49:41,547
I think you need to have a...
a grown-up as a lifeguard.

614
00:49:44,547 --> 00:49:47,415
You're a grown-up.

615
00:49:47,416 --> 00:49:50,317
Um, well, that's a good point.

616
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:52,788
I'm just... I'm not very...

617
00:49:52,789 --> 00:49:55,689
Anyway, let's get you
back to bed, okay?

618
00:49:55,690 --> 00:49:58,093
I won't splash anymore.
I promise.

619
00:49:58,094 --> 00:50:00,396
Can you take me back
to my room?

620
00:50:01,396 --> 00:50:04,396
- Um...
- It's dark.

621
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,470
I... I don't want to
wake your parents up.

622
00:50:08,471 --> 00:50:10,740
We can walk
on tippy-toes.

623
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:12,540
Okay.

624
00:50:31,126 --> 00:50:34,428
Man. These stickers...

625
00:50:34,429 --> 00:50:37,631
I had stickers like that
when I was your age,

626
00:50:37,632 --> 00:50:42,404
except I also had, like,
birds and bees and stuff.

627
00:50:42,405 --> 00:50:47,478
They only had outer space stuff
at the Creativity Store.

628
00:50:48,478 --> 00:50:51,349
Well, it's looking good
in here.

629
00:50:54,349 --> 00:50:56,387
Mmm.

630
00:50:59,387 --> 00:51:01,326
Okay.

631
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:05,864
Okay. Good night.

632
00:51:19,141 --> 00:51:21,409
So, we can listen to what
he's doing on the synth...

633
00:51:21,410 --> 00:51:23,578
with the ambient sounds
already in if you want.

634
00:51:23,579 --> 00:51:25,217
Yeah, that would be
super helpful.

635
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:39,426
Seems like he wants to play on the synth
more than actually work on the film.

636
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:42,197
We'll make it good.
Don't worry.

637
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,436
Hey, David, do you
want to run to the store...

638
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:50,471
and pick up that squishy food
for the Foley?

639
00:51:50,472 --> 00:51:53,207
I just want to finish
before the party tonight.

640
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:55,243
Uh, you don't want to
finish this first?

641
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:58,282
That's okay. I think
Martine can run the board.

642
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:02,418
Copy that.
Uh, back in 20.

643
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,701
I don't know
how to work the board.

644
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:22,870
It'll be fine. Just hit space bar,
come back here and watch it with me.

645
00:52:22,871 --> 00:52:25,541
Okay.

646
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:34,855
Ready?

647
00:53:04,813 --> 00:53:07,960
I think I want synth
in the whole movie.

648
00:53:28,804 --> 00:53:31,339
Okay. David,
you can take Martine.

649
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,340
The kids can ride together.

650
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:32,941
Great.

651
00:53:32,942 --> 00:53:34,612
Oh. Okay.

652
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:39,612
You know where you're going?

653
00:53:37,612 --> 00:53:39,585
Yeah.

654
00:53:53,862 --> 00:53:56,599
There you go. Get some more.

655
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,434
No.

656
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:05,406
No, that's all part of it.

657
00:54:05,407 --> 00:54:08,610
It works better when you cough.
You guys don't know that?

658
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:36,735
It's the inevitable run-in.

659
00:54:33,735 --> 00:54:36,005
Inevitable?

660
00:54:37,005 --> 00:54:40,674
Well, it's a small town... at least
the parts of it that we inhabit.

661
00:54:40,675 --> 00:54:42,910
Gosh. You look amazing.

662
00:54:42,911 --> 00:54:44,946
Thank you.

663
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:47,947
It's good to see you.

664
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:47,518
Are you a friend of Rosa's?

665
00:54:49,518 --> 00:54:51,653
You're not allowed to say?

666
00:54:51,654 --> 00:54:53,824
Hmm.

667
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,857
Can we go somewhere and talk?

668
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:59,858
Ha, ha. Very funny.

669
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:59,828
Mm-mmm.

670
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,567
I want to be alone with you.

671
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:06,533
Um...

672
00:55:06,534 --> 00:55:09,534
I don't think
that's a good idea.

673
00:55:06,534 --> 00:55:09,104
Are you sure?

674
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:11,608
You look like you might.

675
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:15,617
- Might what?
- Want to... be alone with me.

676
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:46,473
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you.

677
00:55:46,474 --> 00:55:49,611
My mom is stoned.
It's hilarious.

678
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,615
Let's get out of here.

679
00:58:46,288 --> 00:58:47,224
I need to tell you something.

680
00:58:50,224 --> 00:58:52,292
Take a walk with me.

681
00:58:52,293 --> 00:58:54,895
I can't. I'll see you on Monday.

682
00:58:54,896 --> 00:58:56,369
Take a walk with me.

683
00:59:01,369 --> 00:59:04,272
You don't know how crazy
you make me.

684
00:59:04,273 --> 00:59:06,009
Well, then I guess I'm
not doing my job, am I?

685
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,678
You're too witty to...

686
00:59:11,679 --> 00:59:14,351
be a professional listener.

687
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:21,351
I have to go find my daughter.

688
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:21,756
Mm-mmm. Just give me
a minute of your time.

689
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:23,000
This has already gone too far.

690
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:35,036
Drop your glass.

691
01:00:09,905 --> 01:00:12,342
If you moved here,
you could live on the West Side.

692
01:00:13,342 --> 01:00:15,176
You can walk on the West Side.

693
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:17,286
I don't like the beach.

694
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,286
Hey.

695
01:00:24,286 --> 01:00:26,187
Hey. What's up?

696
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:28,097
I gotta get out of here.

697
01:00:35,097 --> 01:00:37,157
- Let's-Let's go.
- Okay.

698
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:04,353
Oh. I forgot my bag.

699
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,952
All right.

700
01:02:03,952 --> 01:02:05,285
All right.

701
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:07,286
I'll see you inside.

702
01:02:05,286 --> 01:02:07,053
Yeah. I'll...

703
01:02:07,054 --> 01:02:09,097
I'll see you soon.

704
01:02:16,097 --> 01:02:17,503
Hey, Peter.

705
01:02:22,503 --> 01:02:24,422
I gotta go.

706
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:43,567
Hey.

707
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:53,969
What the fuck are you doing?

708
01:02:54,969 --> 01:02:57,404
What the fuck are you doing?

709
01:02:57,405 --> 01:02:59,239
What?

710
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,308
You want to fuck me up? Fine.

711
01:03:01,309 --> 01:03:05,078
You were doing a pretty damn good job of
it before you had to go fuck my assistant.

712
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,080
Okay. Whoa.

713
01:03:07,081 --> 01:03:09,482
I'm not trying
to fuck with you.

714
01:03:09,483 --> 01:03:12,085
I'm... I didn't mean
for this to happen.

715
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:14,387
This whole time I was...
I was feeling something.

716
01:03:14,388 --> 01:03:16,490
I was feeling like there was some
sort of connection between us.

717
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:18,859
But that was all bullshit.

718
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:22,096
I'm taking all my time,
and I'm doing this for you.

719
01:03:22,097 --> 01:03:24,434
And you go and you betrayed me.

720
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,602
Betrayed you?

721
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,603
But, dude, you're married.

722
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,937
That's right. I'm married!

723
01:03:30,938 --> 01:03:33,274
With a family!

724
01:03:33,275 --> 01:03:35,543
And now I have to go figure out
a way to fix this.

725
01:03:35,544 --> 01:03:39,080
I'm just here trying to work,
and you're all over me,

726
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,389
and I'm just doing what I have
to do to get my shit done.

727
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:08,186
Take your files and figure out
a way to fix your own movie.

728
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:28,306
Fuck!

729
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:04,469
I want to learn to say
some more practical words.

730
01:05:07,469 --> 01:05:09,569
I don't know.

731
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,570
What's the word for "suitcase"?

732
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,238
Suitcase?

733
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:14,184
Yeah. What's the word
for "suitcase"?

734
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:25,489
I'm not a poet.

735
01:05:27,489 --> 01:05:29,001
Some poems.

736
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,373
Ah!

737
01:05:44,373 --> 01:05:45,742
No.

738
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,643
No.

739
01:05:49,643 --> 01:05:51,245
Angry poems.

740
01:05:51,246 --> 01:05:53,094
Angry poems.

741
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:07,639
In English.

742
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:22,246
"Sometimes there's a person
who you know looks right.

743
01:06:25,246 --> 01:06:29,183
Their skin is fine,
like a linen cloth,

744
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:31,655
and their hair
is the color of night.

745
01:06:33,655 --> 01:06:36,592
And they walk.

746
01:06:37,592 --> 01:06:39,627
And when they walk,

747
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:43,532
that walk makes ladies turn
to their window and admire.

748
01:06:44,532 --> 01:06:47,804
All the ladies in the town,

749
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:52,780
with their secret things
that they want.

750
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,848
You were this man...

751
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:03,517
in the town
from which you came,

752
01:07:03,518 --> 01:07:05,718
but this...

753
01:07:05,719 --> 01:07:08,760
this is not your town.

754
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:14,127
And when you speak,

755
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:17,365
your words are snakes
I swat at with swords.

756
01:07:18,365 --> 01:07:20,667
They crawl into parts of me,

757
01:07:20,668 --> 01:07:23,673
and I kill them
with kindness I can't afford.

758
01:07:25,673 --> 01:07:27,575
I see you...

759
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,614
with the accurate eyes
of the sun.

760
01:07:32,614 --> 01:07:36,350
You think you're imprinting
yourself in my memory,

761
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:39,556
a man with the power to teach.

762
01:07:41,556 --> 01:07:46,661
You will never have anything
or anyone you want,

763
01:07:47,661 --> 01:07:49,796
least of all...

764
01:07:49,797 --> 01:07:51,202
me.

765
01:07:54,202 --> 01:07:56,904
If I were to tell my mother
and the others,

766
01:07:56,905 --> 01:07:59,205
we would laugh at you,

767
01:07:59,206 --> 01:08:03,774
louder than we have
all along."

768
01:08:33,774 --> 01:08:36,676
I don't understand.

769
01:08:36,677 --> 01:08:38,887
You don't understand?

770
01:08:46,887 --> 01:08:48,559
Basta!

771
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:54,461
- Who the fuck is this? - iVamos!
iVoy a llamar a la policía! iAhora!

772
01:08:54,462 --> 01:08:56,764
That's Spanish. I'm Italian.

773
01:08:56,765 --> 01:08:59,649
I don't give a shit.
Get out.

774
01:09:21,523 --> 01:09:23,694
Are you okay?

775
01:09:26,694 --> 01:09:28,962
I'm okay.

776
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:31,600
I don't know
about that plant though.

777
01:09:33,768 --> 01:09:36,370
I just don't want to
have to explain it.

778
01:09:36,371 --> 01:09:39,974
We can get that cleaned up
before anyone sees it.

779
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:43,844
My mom's gonna be so mad
I don't have a tutor anymore.

780
01:09:43,845 --> 01:09:45,845
I provoked him...

781
01:09:45,846 --> 01:09:48,985
with my angry poem.

782
01:09:50,985 --> 01:09:54,657
Maybe he provoked you
into writing an angry poem.

783
01:09:55,657 --> 01:09:58,496
I'm supposed to take
the Italian S.A.T. too.

784
01:10:01,496 --> 01:10:03,466
I didn't think there was
anyone in the house.

785
01:10:05,466 --> 01:10:08,035
Yeah. I was just coming back
from a long walk.

786
01:10:08,036 --> 01:10:09,439
A walk where?

787
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,645
I got down to Hyperion,
and then I turned around and...

788
01:10:16,645 --> 01:10:20,617
Someone pulled over because they
thought I was a prostitute.

789
01:10:22,617 --> 01:10:24,956
Maybe they just thought
you were hot.

790
01:10:27,956 --> 01:10:30,025
Well, not the way that Italian
fellow thinks you're hot.

791
01:10:31,025 --> 01:10:34,025
He throws things,
he gets so excited.

792
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,006
I want Martine gone
by tomorrow.

793
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:21,809
I'm sure you understand
why we need to terminate.

794
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,711
Terminate?

795
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:26,813
I have a list of names,
qualified colleagues.

796
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:28,715
Oh, God.

797
01:11:28,716 --> 01:11:30,856
Oh, God.

798
01:11:35,856 --> 01:11:37,991
What happened between us...

799
01:11:37,992 --> 01:11:41,694
was an incredible breach
of professionalism...

800
01:11:41,695 --> 01:11:44,536
and is not the way
I want to conduct myself.

801
01:11:48,536 --> 01:11:51,161
Really? Not even a little bit?

802
01:12:13,161 --> 01:12:15,663
Kolt, come in. The water's hot.

803
01:12:16,663 --> 01:12:18,698
I don't really feel
like getting wet.

804
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:22,805
Mom just blew up the purple raft.
You can go in that and not get wet.

805
01:12:40,622 --> 01:12:42,956
Kolt. We can do a somersault.

806
01:12:42,957 --> 01:12:45,027
Let's do them at the same time.
One,

807
01:12:46,027 --> 01:12:48,027
two, three.

808
01:13:06,948 --> 01:13:08,453
Smells good in here.

809
01:13:11,453 --> 01:13:13,189
It's Dusty's favorite.

810
01:13:15,189 --> 01:13:17,929
I'm leaving.

811
01:13:20,929 --> 01:13:22,996
I'll call you a cab.

812
01:13:22,997 --> 01:13:26,001
No, there's one
on the way already.

813
01:13:27,001 --> 01:13:28,538
Oh.

814
01:13:34,908 --> 01:13:37,479
I'll send your files
in a few days.

815
01:13:42,216 --> 01:13:44,751
I'm thinking
of adding more synth.

816
01:13:44,752 --> 01:13:46,923
I think it'll be good.

817
01:13:49,923 --> 01:13:51,261
Thank you.

818
01:13:54,261 --> 01:13:56,063
All right, all right.

819
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,064
Oh. Let's...

820
01:13:56,064 --> 01:13:58,799
Who wants it?

821
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,200
Grilled cheese!

822
01:14:00,201 --> 01:14:02,201
Oh, I didn't know
you wanted one.

823
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,604
No, these are for me
and Sea Horse. No, no, no.

824
01:14:04,605 --> 01:14:06,605
- Grilled cheese! Grilled cheese!
- No, no, no. Those aren't yours.

825
01:14:06,608 --> 01:14:07,943
This isn't yours.
You go in here.

826
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,510
Grilled cheese! Grilled cheese!

827
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,943
All right, fine.
You can have one.

828
01:14:10,511 --> 01:14:12,211
This is mine.
I want this one.

829
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:15,212
How's the water?

830
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:15,047
It's good. It's nice actually.

831
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:17,048
Ooh. It's cold.

832
01:14:15,048 --> 01:14:17,118
It's not that bad.

833
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:22,154
After all that hard work?

834
01:14:23,658 --> 01:14:25,164
Thanks for lunch, by the way.

835
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:11,340
Hey.

836
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:15,207
I'm, uh...
I'm heading out.

837
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:18,208
Back to New York?

838
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:18,312
Yeah. Back tonight.

839
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:21,214
Thank you again
so much for everything.

840
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,983
You have a really amazing home.

841
01:15:23,984 --> 01:15:25,986
Okay.

842
01:15:25,987 --> 01:15:28,956
And if you ever
come to New York, or...

843
01:15:28,957 --> 01:15:30,957
if Kolt is interested
in RISD...

844
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:35,100
This is probably the last you'll be
hearing from anybody in this family.

845
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,702
Good luck with your film.
