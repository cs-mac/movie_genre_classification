I, uh, I like to play
a game with my girlfriend

31
00:02:06,095 --> 00:02:08,437
when I go to the supermarket
where I try to think

32
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,357
of something
that I can yell to her

33
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:15,486
that would make people think
that she is crazy.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,572
And we were at the supermarket
and I was behind

35
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,532
the shopping cart
and she was maybe ten, 15 feet

36
00:02:19,566 --> 00:02:21,910
away from me,
and I yelled to her,

00:02:21,944 --> 00:02:24,704
"You know what?
I am gonna get toilet paper!

wearing a fedora.

43
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:48,644
And I always thought to myself
that when I saw abuse,

44
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:51,255
I would know what to do.

45
00:02:52,724 --> 00:02:55,818
But you can't call the police

46
00:02:55,852 --> 00:02:58,863

a six-year-old in a fedora.

I think he's being raised to be
an insufferable jazz guitarist."

48
00:03:08,031 --> 00:03:10,792
I stayed, uh, at a hotel
in Boston,

49
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:12,961
and I had to make an hour-long
phone call

50
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:16,213
on a land line to New York City,
and afterwards...

51
00:03:16,247 --> 00:03:17,632
I didn't know how much
it would cost, and afterwards,

52
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:19,717
when I was checking out
I was like, uh,

53
00:03:19,751 --> 00:03:21,594
"How much was that phone call?"
The woman behind the counter

54
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:25,765
was like, "Oh, your phone call
was $66."

55
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,976
That's crazy.

56
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,603
That would only be reasonable
if that's how much it cost

57
00:03:30,637 --> 00:03:33,940
the day after
they invented the phone.

58
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,109

61
00:03:45,694 --> 00:03:48,454
That's crazy, if a hotel wants
to make money that badly,

62
00:03:48,488 --> 00:03:50,539
then they should just charge
to, like, use the bathroom

63
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:52,708
in your own hotel room.
You know? I've certainly been

in a situation where I really
need to use the bathroom,

65
00:03:54,577 --> 00:03:56,587

it's for customers only."

Provincetown

00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:22,613

and it's also very, very gay.

the best accent

which is a guy whose accent

77
00:04:28,904 --> 00:04:33,916
was 60 percent Boston
and 40 percent gay.

78
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,877
And he just kind of went,
"I don't have a fuckin'

on my whale-watch!"

I could open it up

87
00:05:06,149 --> 00:05:10,953
I, uh, I did a show
in Northampton, Massachusetts.

88
00:05:10,987 --> 00:05:13,330
And there was an article
in the local paper about it

89
00:05:13,364 --> 00:05:15,875
and they interviewed
one of the comics on the show

90
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:18,627
but they misquoted him.
He had said that, uh,

91
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:20,880
comedy is tragedy plus time,

92
00:05:20,914 --> 00:05:24,217
which is like a very popular
thing, uh, to say.

93
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:27,386
But they had quoted him
as saying, "Comedy is tragedy

94
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,372
plus timing."

95
00:05:32,717 --> 00:05:35,519
That is a radically
different idea.

96
00:05:35,553 --> 00:05:38,564
"Comedy is tragedy plus time"
is like,

97
00:05:38,598 --> 00:05:40,942
in World War I, they used
to use mustard gas,

98
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:44,695
and now that's something
you get at a deli.

99
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:48,157
"Comedy is tragedy plus timing"

100
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:51,119
is the idea that yesterday
I found out that my friend

101
00:05:51,153 --> 00:05:56,106
got... Lou Gehrig's Disease!

102

A lot of people ask me if, uh,
I try jokes out on Twitter.

103
00:06:07,961 --> 00:06:13,457
And I don't, but I do
try them out on LinkedIn!

104
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:19,647
That is a very dumb thing
to say.

uh, at the airport,

107

and I was buying
a neck pillow.

108
00:06:28,815 --> 00:06:30,658
And the guy at the counter
was like,

109
00:06:30,692 --> 00:06:33,286
"If you get one neck pillow,
it's $17.99.

110
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,290
But if you get two,
it's only $20.99."

111
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:40,042
I was like, "Oh,
I would totally do that,

112
00:06:40,076 --> 00:06:44,964
if I had two necks."

113
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:46,132
The guy behind
the counter laughed.

114
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,300
The guy behind me laughed.

115

We have the same culture.

122
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:17,913
Um... did you know
that Khaleesi is becoming

123
00:07:17,947 --> 00:07:19,707
a really popular baby name?

124
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:21,792
Like, more popular
than, like, Betsy.

125
00:07:21,826 --> 00:07:26,172
Which is moderately popular,
but at least that's a name.

126
00:07:26,206 --> 00:07:28,924
You know, but I do love
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

127
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:31,052
And I was thinking that maybe
if I had a little boy,

128
00:07:31,086 --> 00:07:33,679
I would, you know, maybe
I would name him, like,

129
00:07:33,713 --> 00:07:36,582
Black Vagina Fog.

130
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:41,670
That is my<i> Game of Thrones</i> joke.

131
00:07:44,807 --> 00:07:47,318
Where, uh, where we record
<i>Bob's Burgers,</i>

132
00:07:47,352 --> 00:07:49,111
- um, on the... Yeah.
- [scattered cheering]

133
00:07:49,145 --> 00:07:53,157
- Uh...
- [cheering, applause]

134
00:07:53,191 --> 00:07:56,393
I'm gonna just name things.

135
00:07:57,987 --> 00:08:00,956
Um, where we record it
on the... I think we share...

136
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,251
The floor is shared with like
a computer company or something.

137
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:05,502
And in the bathroom is a sign
that tells you

138
00:08:05,536 --> 00:08:08,381
to not, uh, pee everywhere,
and if you do, clean it up.

139
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,383
Which I always think
is really funny,

140
00:08:10,417 --> 00:08:13,052
as if like that's a thing
a person wouldn't know.

141
00:08:13,086 --> 00:08:15,388
I get if that was like
in a kindergarten room.

142
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,139
But this is all... anyway.

143
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:19,892
And then also at, uh,
a lot of restaurants,

144
00:08:19,926 --> 00:08:21,852
as you know, in the bathroom
it'll say, like,

145
00:08:21,886 --> 00:08:24,188
there'll be a sign that says,
"Employees must wash hands."

146
00:08:24,222 --> 00:08:27,858
And, uh, I always wanted
to add, like,

147
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:31,779
it made me wanna really add
signs to restaurant bathrooms.

148
00:08:31,813 --> 00:08:34,115
But if I just put a sign there,
I know that people

149
00:08:34,149 --> 00:08:36,158
would just think a person
put a sign there.

150
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:38,327
I was sort of like, what would
make it seem like official?

151
00:08:38,361 --> 00:08:41,289
And I decided that that line
was lamination.

152
00:08:41,323 --> 00:08:44,875
You know, if you laminate a sign
and put...

153
00:08:44,909 --> 00:08:49,004
Nobody thinks somebody would buy
a laminating machine as a joke.

154
00:08:49,038 --> 00:08:53,301
So I bought
a laminating machine.

155
00:08:53,335 --> 00:08:57,054
And I've been going around
New York City

156
00:08:57,088 --> 00:09:00,933
and adding signs just, you know,
a pretty official looking sign

157
00:09:00,967 --> 00:09:03,060
underneath the regular sign.

158
00:09:03,094 --> 00:09:05,396
And here's just some of the
signs I've been putting up.

159
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,258
"Please do not flush socks
down toilet."

160
00:09:12,187 --> 00:09:16,640
"Please wash feet
before returning to work."

161
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:23,605
"Do not use your cell phone
ever again."

162
00:09:27,785 --> 00:09:31,655
"Walk out of here crying
and ask for a lawyer."

163
00:09:35,168 --> 00:09:38,246
"Divorce is not an option."

164
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:44,543
"It's normal to feel Jewish,
even if you're not."

165
00:09:47,847 --> 00:09:51,550
"Your child
is being raised wrong."

166
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,906
And then lastly,
"There are officially

167
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:00,726
no more snakes here."

168
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,939
Thank you.

169
00:10:10,203 --> 00:10:13,422
Nobody would have thought
there were snakes.

170
00:10:13,456 --> 00:10:16,951
They must be terrified that
there are officially none.

171
00:10:18,336 --> 00:10:20,346
I rented a car.

172
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,058
Um, and I got into
a car accident

173
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:26,352
on the highway
with a semi truck.

174
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:27,895
- [audience] Ooh!
- Yeah, I know.

175
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,813
I had that exact reaction.

176
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:31,857
The good news is I got
into the accident

177
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:33,942
at about seven miles an hour.

178
00:10:33,976 --> 00:10:36,445
So I was getting into a lane,

179
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:38,447
and I thought I was in a lane
and then the truck

180
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,200
absolutely disagreed,

181
00:10:41,234 --> 00:10:44,328
and it hit me, and, uh,
then we both pulled over.

182
00:10:44,362 --> 00:10:46,497
And, uh, we were both shaken,

183
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:48,165
and the guy got out
and he was furious.

184
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:49,917
And he started yelling like,
"You cut me off!

185
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:52,169
Look where you're going!"
And I, uh,

186
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:56,424
I disagreed with him, but I
wasn't gonna match his energy.

187
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:59,343
And he's, like, yelling, like,
"You cut me off! Ahh!"

188
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:01,803
And then I just look at him
and I go,

189
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:04,748
"No!"

190
00:11:06,926 --> 00:11:09,019
He was terrified.

191
00:11:09,053 --> 00:11:10,938
He was like, "I don't know
what you're doing.

192
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:14,442
But I do not like it."

193
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:17,445
We were... I was like, "Should
we exchange information?"

194
00:11:17,479 --> 00:11:21,765
And, uh, and his favorite
restaurant is Panera.

195
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:27,955
He went to his truck
and got like a binder

196
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,124
with everything that I needed,
and then I went

197
00:11:30,158 --> 00:11:32,209
to the glove compartment
of my rental car,

198
00:11:32,243 --> 00:11:35,170
and sort of started looking
through the...

199
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:37,714
Like a kitty cat, like I was
like, "I don't know what..."

200
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:39,592
[meows]

201
00:11:39,626 --> 00:11:42,678
And then I was just, like,
pulling things out,

202
00:11:42,712 --> 00:11:44,555
and, like, showing them
to him... Like, I was, like,

203
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:46,223
like I might as well have
taken out, like,

204
00:11:46,257 --> 00:11:48,267
shoelaces and wet chicken
and been like,

205
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,436
"Is this what you need?
Is this...

206
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,021
...at all helpful?
I don't know what...

207
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:56,317
We're looking for.
I don't see... anything."

208
00:11:56,351 --> 00:11:59,053
And he's definitely like,
"Hey, how'd you get a car?"

209
00:12:00,647 --> 00:12:02,406
And I called
the rental car company

210
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,158
and they're like,
"Your agreement,

211
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:06,118
your rental agreement
is your registration."

212
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:07,411
I'm like, great,
and I give it to him.

213
00:12:07,445 --> 00:12:08,579
And we exchange everything.

214
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:09,955
And then a policeman comes

215
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,248
and he's really nice.

216
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:13,208
And he fills out
a police report

217
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,169
and then I think the guy
who owns the truck company

218
00:12:15,203 --> 00:12:20,132
comes and he's like
a super muscular Danny DeVito.

219
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:22,468
And that's good.
And then I leave.

220
00:12:22,502 --> 00:12:25,762
Um, well, I...
I asked the policeman

221
00:12:25,796 --> 00:12:28,056
if I could go, I didn't just go,
like, "I'm an artist.

222
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,501
And this is boring!" I...

223
00:12:35,264 --> 00:12:37,399
I was like, "Can I go?"
And he was like, "Sure."

224
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:41,362
And, uh, a few weeks later,
the rental car company called me

225
00:12:41,396 --> 00:12:43,780
to go through everything,
they asked like 30-40 questions.

226
00:12:43,814 --> 00:12:47,951
The last two questions are:
"Were you under the influence?"

227
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:49,911
and "Were you distracted?"

228
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:52,414
And I couldn't help myself.

229
00:12:52,448 --> 00:12:54,124
'Cause I was like, "Well, I
don't know if it would matter,

230
00:12:54,158 --> 00:12:58,379
but I had taken PCP.

231
00:12:58,413 --> 00:13:03,467
And I was experiencing
a loss of ego boundaries.

232
00:13:03,501 --> 00:13:06,787
And I was also
watching<i> Backdraft."</i>

233
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:11,892
Do you think somewhere
there's a recording of that?

234
00:13:11,926 --> 00:13:14,753
[laughs]

235
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:19,633
That... that's a thing
that happened.

236
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:23,738
I do get a lot of emails...
I get a lot of emails

237
00:13:23,772 --> 00:13:28,116
asking, people asking me
to join either LinkedIn

238
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,994
or recommend them.
I know it's not a dating site,

239
00:13:31,028 --> 00:13:34,707
but it could... No, uh...

240
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:39,086
I, uh, so I get a lot of things
asking me to be on LinkedIn.

241
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,671
And I was finally like,
you know what? I'm gonna do it.

242
00:13:40,705 --> 00:13:43,507
I'm gonna make a résumé.
And did you know...

243
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,802
So I made one.
You can write anything you want.

244
00:13:46,836 --> 00:13:52,433
Like, anything. There's no...
no... nothing checks it.

245
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,185
Like, for instance,
I made a profile, that's me.

246
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:57,104
And, uh, my job is, as you know,

247
00:13:57,138 --> 00:14:00,257
I'm the senior VP
of pee-pee at Verizon.

248
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:03,444
And it kind of goes like,
"Do you mean

249
00:14:03,478 --> 00:14:05,237
the telecommunications company?"
I'm like, "Yep.

250
00:14:05,271 --> 00:14:08,699
Tag it. Tag it."

251
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,493
I don't think Verizon searches,

252
00:14:11,527 --> 00:14:15,205
'cause I'm still the senior VP
of pee-pee.

253
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,083
The only jobs that I'm
approached about

254
00:14:18,117 --> 00:14:21,253
are other VP positions
in New York City.

255
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:23,046
And then it's sort of like,

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,673
"Tell me about your
job experience."

257
00:14:24,707 --> 00:14:26,592
And, you know, and I'm like,
"Oh, well, uh,

258
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,636
I am passionately opposed
to sex in bathrooms

259
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,806
in the workplace.

260
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,974
I don't think it should happen
unless both parties

261
00:14:34,008 --> 00:14:36,310
agree on it.

262
00:14:36,344 --> 00:14:40,297
I guess I'm simply against
sexual assault in bathrooms."

263
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:45,177
I'm on the right side
of that issue.

264
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:49,364
Just if there's any question.

265
00:14:49,398 --> 00:14:53,118
You can also write in, uh,
what you did previously,

266
00:14:53,152 --> 00:14:55,370
and I wrote that my job
beforehand was that I was

267
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:57,539
the... "Holy fuck, shit! Oh, no!

268
00:14:57,573 --> 00:15:00,025
At CNN."

269
00:15:03,371 --> 00:15:05,589
You write then your skills.
My skills are, uh,

270
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:08,175
marketing. Right?

271
00:15:08,209 --> 00:15:11,078
My next skill is surgery.

272
00:15:12,296 --> 00:15:15,182
That's a guy you want
on your side.

273
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:19,645
Another skill I have
is that I'm bicurious-curious.

274
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:22,105
So sort of like if you're
bicurious, I'm like,

275
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,358
"Tell me how that...
what is that like

276
00:15:24,392 --> 00:15:27,761
to be interested...
tell me about that experience."

277
00:15:29,146 --> 00:15:30,656
Another thing I do pretty well

278
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:33,116
is, uh, wolf toss.

279
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,369
So like, if there was like a...

280
00:15:35,403 --> 00:15:38,246
The job, if there was like
a wolf... a wolf that was asleep,

281
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,833
I wouldn't throw it,
'cause I'm not a fucking idiot.

282
00:15:40,867 --> 00:15:44,461
But I'd definitely gently
toss...

283
00:15:44,495 --> 00:15:47,172
...toss the wolf.

284
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:50,217
And then lastly, my last skill
is, "I can tell

285
00:15:50,251 --> 00:15:54,079
if someone is telling the truth
by drowning them."

286
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:06,107
So I realized I put my birthday
as January 1st, 1905.

287
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:08,276
So that's a guy with experience.

288
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:10,404
He maybe is good at surgery.

289
00:16:10,438 --> 00:16:13,890
He could drain your humors.

290
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:18,370
Weirdly, at the bottom,
instead of it saying, like,

291
00:16:18,404 --> 00:16:20,205
contact information,
it just says,

292
00:16:20,239 --> 00:16:22,958
"Advice for contacting Eugene."

293
00:16:22,992 --> 00:16:24,668
Like you would just be like,
"Well, have you tried his mom?

294
00:16:24,702 --> 00:16:26,837
She can always...

295
00:16:26,871 --> 00:16:29,464
She can always get through."

296
00:16:29,498 --> 00:16:31,508
I just wrote, "Cut a message
in a corn field,

297
00:16:31,542 --> 00:16:33,761
take a picture
and stand outside in the crowd

298
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:36,037
of<i> Good Morning America."</i>

299
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:40,959
- Thank you.
- [applause]

300
00:16:46,432 --> 00:16:50,051
Thanks. I made, uh, I made
a pretty sweet zine.

301
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:53,154
I cut up a bunch of things,

302
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:54,656
and, like, you know,
pasted it.

303
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,409
And then I went to, uh...

304
00:16:57,443 --> 00:16:59,954
Kinko's to try
to make some copies.

305
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:02,414
I went to a copy place.
And I was like,

306
00:17:02,448 --> 00:17:05,333
"Hey, can you, uh..."

307
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,961
I was like, "Can you make, like,
I don't know, like,

308
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,005
100 or 200 copies
on colored paper for tomorrow?"

309
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,299
And I thought that was a pretty
reasonable question.

310
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:15,552
And then they, to my surprise,
were like,

311
00:17:15,586 --> 00:17:18,013
[shouting] "We don't have
that kind of paper in stock!

312
00:17:18,047 --> 00:17:22,434
Corporate doesn't let us
have that kind of paper!"

313
00:17:22,468 --> 00:17:26,521
I was so... they acted like
I went into the Kinko's,

314
00:17:26,555 --> 00:17:30,759
and was like, [shouting]
"Who here can land a plane?!"

315
00:17:34,897 --> 00:17:37,140
None of them can.

316
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:43,455
Um...

317
00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:46,333
Around Jewish High Holidays,

318
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:49,377
uh, in New York,
there's a lot of, uh,

319
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:51,797
Jews on the streets
that are... that are dressed

320
00:17:51,831 --> 00:17:55,909
as kind of like
Gandalf the Sad.

321
00:17:57,045 --> 00:18:00,347
And if you're Jewish,
when you pass them,

322
00:18:00,381 --> 00:18:02,683
they get very excited
and they're like,

323
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:04,643
"Are you Jewish?" 'Cause they
want to cast a spell

324
00:18:04,677 --> 00:18:06,770
and do a thing.

325
00:18:06,804 --> 00:18:08,939
And I always, you know,
I have this conflict

326
00:18:08,973 --> 00:18:11,399
where, like, I, you know,
I don't want to talk to them,

327
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:13,360
but I also don't wanna lie
to them 'cause I don't want

328
00:18:13,394 --> 00:18:15,988
to feel... I feel the weight
of thousands of years

329
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:17,656
of ancestors being like,
"Really? We went through

330
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,700
all this and you won't even
just be like...

331
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:24,913
...just be like, 'Oh, no,
I'm Greek, bye.'"

332
00:18:24,947 --> 00:18:26,999
I get so anxious.

333
00:18:27,033 --> 00:18:29,543
And I was in downtown Brooklyn,
I was walking to Guitar Center

334
00:18:29,577 --> 00:18:33,547
and I passed these two
very sad Gandalfs.

335
00:18:33,581 --> 00:18:36,132
And their eyes light up and
they're like, "Are you Jewish?"

336
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:39,386
And I start getting so anxious
and I don't know what to say,

337
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:42,597
and I just go, like, "Yes!
But you don't know how Jewish.

338
00:18:42,631 --> 00:18:46,501
I just almost killed my son
on a mountaintop!"

339
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:50,397
We kind of both agreed, like,
I didn't like,

340
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:53,300
but no need to keep talking
to me.

341
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,278
And I went on and I went
to, uh, Guitar Center.

342
00:18:57,312 --> 00:18:59,698
And when you get there, uh,

343
00:18:59,732 --> 00:19:01,575
they take your bag from you,
'cause they're afraid

344
00:19:01,609 --> 00:19:05,412
you'll steal guitars
in your canvas bag.

345
00:19:05,446 --> 00:19:07,622
And, uh, the guy took my bag
and he was like,

346
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:10,042
"Oh, my God.
Uh, you're on Adult Swim.

347
00:19:10,076 --> 00:19:11,919
You're on<i> Delocated."</i>
I was like, "Yeah."

348
00:19:11,953 --> 00:19:13,503
And he's like,
"Oh, I love that show."

349
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:14,838
I'm like, "Thank you."
Then I go in

350
00:19:14,872 --> 00:19:16,757
and I get whatever cable
I'm getting.

351
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:18,759
And then when I'm leaving,
he gives me back my bag

352
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,802
and he goes, "You know,
we actually get a lot

353
00:19:20,836 --> 00:19:22,971
of celebrities here."
And I was like, "Oh, he's gonna

354
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,849
be like, 'This is the store
that Slash comes to buy ropes

355
00:19:25,883 --> 00:19:28,643
to tie up his balls
so he can cum.'"

356
00:19:28,677 --> 00:19:33,107
I'm like, "Yeah!
Tell me that story!"

357
00:19:33,141 --> 00:19:35,067
And he's like, "Yeah, you know
who else comes here?

358
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:38,528
He's, uh, guy, he plays like
a kid on a cartoon

359
00:19:38,562 --> 00:19:41,406
on Fox about a family that runs,
like, a burger place,

360
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,576
plays like..."
I'm just sort of staring at him.

361
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:48,956
And I'm like,
"Do you mean me?"

362
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:53,043
And he's like, "Oh, yeah.
Still just you.

363
00:19:53,077 --> 00:19:57,531
- You still come here sometimes."
- [applause]

364
00:20:01,877 --> 00:20:05,639
I was... I was at a street fair
in, uh, Brooklyn.

365
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:09,143
And I passed this lady
who was handing out these cards.

366
00:20:09,177 --> 00:20:12,646
That, I think I have one.
Yeah. It's a, uh,

367
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,149
"Get out of hell free."

368
00:20:15,183 --> 00:20:17,818
I got super excited,
I was like, "Can I have some?"

369
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:19,736
She gave me like two or three.
I took them and I went,

370
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,431
"Now I can murder someone!"

371
00:20:26,152 --> 00:20:30,330
And... she looked at me,
and she kind of went like,

372
00:20:30,364 --> 00:20:33,125
"Yes."

373
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:36,670
Like, "Oh, my God.
You're terrifying."

374
00:20:36,704 --> 00:20:38,505
She was like, "That's not
why we're here,

375
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:40,699
but that is a perk."

376
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,679
I... I signed up
for ChristianMingle.

377
00:20:45,713 --> 00:20:47,931
- Um...
- [laughter]

378
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:51,185
Even though I am Jewish
and engaged.

379
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:53,020
And when you sign up
for ChristianMingle,

380
00:20:53,054 --> 00:20:54,855
right away they're like
"Hey, don't use your real name.

381
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:56,982
Use a screen name."
And I was like, "Okay.

382
00:20:57,016 --> 00:21:00,235
I'm Princess Thunderballs."

383
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:03,864
And within like 20-30 minutes,
I was locked out of the account.

384
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:05,949
And they were like,
"Princess Thunderballs, sir,

385
00:21:05,983 --> 00:21:08,618
you're not allowed
to find love."

386
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:10,871
Fair enough, ChristianMingle.

387
00:21:10,905 --> 00:21:15,876
But they sold or shared my name
with Believe.com.

388
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:19,129
And Believe.com has none
of those limitations.

389
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:22,174
They email me all the time.
And you can't unsubscribe.

390
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:24,259
You have to, like, to
unsubscribe you have to write it

391
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:26,845
on a shoe why you wanna leave
and mail it to them,

392
00:21:26,879 --> 00:21:29,163
and then they get it,
they're like, "Not good enough."

393
00:21:30,925 --> 00:21:33,601
And they send me all sorts
of stuff, and one of the best

394
00:21:33,635 --> 00:21:37,731
things they send me is, uh,
this thing called, uh, Ask...

395
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:40,234
Here, I'll show it to you.
This thing they send me

396
00:21:40,268 --> 00:21:42,903
called Ask a Pastor,
where this very lovely pastor,

397
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:44,905
you can go online
and ask him anything.

398
00:21:44,939 --> 00:21:46,656
You don't even have to log in
to your account.

399
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,158
You can just go and ask him
a question.

400
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:50,493
So often now when I get home
after a show,

401
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:52,246
I'll just kind of log on
and be like,

402
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:55,165
"Here's a question for you,
Mr. Pastor."

403
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:57,084
And so here's just some
of the questions I've asked

404
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,169
this lovely pastor.

405
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:01,337
"What's a nice way to get out
of a marriage with someone

406
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:05,074
you don't know well that you met
at a bus stop/casino?"

407
00:22:09,797 --> 00:22:13,725
"My wife is always gossiping
about this and that

408
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:16,311
and it drives me crazy.
Is it okay to start having sex

409
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:19,714
with men as long as they
can keep a secret?"

410
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:26,613
"I know God says it's okay
to judge people because

411
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:30,058
of their race. That's it.
Just kind of a fun fact."

412
00:22:35,281 --> 00:22:37,207
"Why am I not allowed
to use the bathroom

413
00:22:37,241 --> 00:22:39,734
at my friend Max's house?"

414
00:22:43,956 --> 00:22:46,007
"Hey, man,
I sometimes have doubts.

415
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:49,661
Not sure about what, though,
and that's kind of the problem."

416
00:22:52,381 --> 00:22:55,016
"I like to think of my ding-dong
as a police baton.

417
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,751
Any advice?"

418
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:01,940
Last one.

419
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:04,734
"I believe I am the father
of a child.

420
00:23:04,768 --> 00:23:07,612
And so does my friend.

421
00:23:07,646 --> 00:23:10,782
What's a good way
to resolve this?

422
00:23:10,816 --> 00:23:14,828
He suggested that we cut
the baby in half.

423
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:19,791
But I think a paternity test
makes more sense.

424
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,127
I don't just want part
of a dead baby,

425
00:23:22,161 --> 00:23:27,299
like some other Jewish parents.

426
00:23:27,333 --> 00:23:30,010
Does the Bible have any advice

427
00:23:30,044 --> 00:23:33,638
on this situation?"

428
00:23:33,672 --> 00:23:37,125
[applause]

429
00:23:43,057 --> 00:23:47,094
I imagine he's like,
"It literally does come up."

430
00:23:48,312 --> 00:23:51,781
Here's a thing that, uh,
happens to me a lot now,

431
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,741
which is when I'm in a store,

432
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:56,744
people assume I work
at that store.

433
00:23:56,778 --> 00:23:59,956
And it is across all stores.

434
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,960
I was in Milwaukee at the
Public Market in a spice shop,

435
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:06,963
and a lady pointed at like
these... at like Himalayan salts

436
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:08,882
at, like, slabs and salt,
and she was like,

437
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:09,966
"Oh! What do you do with that?"
I was like,

438
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,385
"Oh you can grill on it."

439
00:24:11,419 --> 00:24:13,053
And she's like,
"Oh, is this like

440
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:15,013
a substitute for salt?"
I'm like, "No.

441
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:16,890
Himalayan salt is a salt.
It's often thought of

442
00:24:16,924 --> 00:24:18,892
as the purest salt."
She's like, "How much is it?"

443
00:24:18,926 --> 00:24:21,228
And I'm like, "Oh, I...
Oh, I don't..."

444
00:24:21,262 --> 00:24:26,149
I wanted to be like, "You can
have everything for $16."

445
00:24:26,183 --> 00:24:29,194
'Cause, like,
I shouldn't answer...

446
00:24:29,228 --> 00:24:32,197
But the kind that had happened
that was the best

447
00:24:32,231 --> 00:24:36,410
was last summer I was
in, uh, a shoe store in Rome

448
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:39,954
in Italy and it was
like a... like if, like,

449
00:24:39,988 --> 00:24:42,707
Foot Locker just sold, uh,
discount dress shoes.

450
00:24:42,741 --> 00:24:44,792
Whatever that is, that store.

451
00:24:44,826 --> 00:24:48,046
And I was there, uh,
and this lady came up to me

452
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,298
and she starts pointing
at shoes, and in Italian,

453
00:24:50,332 --> 00:24:52,259
I think, asking about the shoes.

454
00:24:52,293 --> 00:24:54,010
But pointing at them
and speaking Italian.

455
00:24:54,044 --> 00:24:55,887
And I don't know...
I don't speak Italian.

456
00:24:55,921 --> 00:24:57,431
I don't know how to say
"I don't speak Italian."

457
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,349
I can say it
in English very well.

458
00:24:59,383 --> 00:25:01,309
In Russian, also quite well.

459
00:25:01,343 --> 00:25:03,186
But in Italian, not at all.

460
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,355
And, uh, so I don't...
so I looked at her

461
00:25:05,389 --> 00:25:07,441
as she's asking me
and I'm just like,

462
00:25:07,475 --> 00:25:10,777
"Uh, I don't speak Italian."
And then, to my surprise,

463
00:25:10,811 --> 00:25:13,613
she... she switches to English
and goes,

464
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:16,891
"Oh, how much is this shoe?"

465
00:25:18,986 --> 00:25:21,329
She's like, "I get that
you don't speak Italian,

466
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:23,831
but you definitely work
in this shoe store.

467
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,834
There's no version where
you don't work here.

468
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:29,237
'Cause look at you,
you work at this shoe store."

469
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,054
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna
show you a thing.

470
00:25:38,088 --> 00:25:39,264
The only time it made sense.

471
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:41,624
Here...

472
00:25:42,884 --> 00:25:46,729
Um, the only time it
was reasonable

473
00:25:46,763 --> 00:25:48,856
was this last November
where somebody thought

474
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:50,733
I worked at the place I was at
was because

475
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:53,236
I was at a Marriott,

476
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,822
in, uh, Costa Rica,

477
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:58,283
and I bought a shirt
at that Marriott.

478
00:25:58,317 --> 00:26:02,120
And then I put it on right away.

479
00:26:02,154 --> 00:26:04,956
And then I walked around
and everybody,

480
00:26:04,990 --> 00:26:06,833
including the employees,
clearly thought

481
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,252
I owned that Marriott.

482
00:26:09,286 --> 00:26:11,212
'Cause everybody kept, like,
asking me either

483
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,714
how to get places
or if everything was all right.

484
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:15,342
So that was worth it.

485
00:26:15,376 --> 00:26:17,827
I'm gonna hide this now.

486
00:26:22,674 --> 00:26:24,392
Yep.

487
00:26:24,426 --> 00:26:27,812
That's a shirt I have
that I can never wear anywhere.

488
00:26:27,846 --> 00:26:32,359
Because it's a Marriott
golf shirt.

489
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:34,402
Well...

490
00:26:34,436 --> 00:26:38,347
I guess if I was hoping
to un-have sex in college.

491
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:44,078
Facebook did a thing
where they charged $100,

492
00:26:44,112 --> 00:26:46,540
uh, to send a message
to Mark Zuckerberg.

493
00:26:46,574 --> 00:26:48,291
They were testing out a way
to message celebrities.

494
00:26:48,325 --> 00:26:50,544
Who here would spend $100

495
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,920
to send a message
to Mark Zuckerberg?

496
00:26:52,954 --> 00:26:55,882
- [man boos]
- [laughter]

497
00:26:55,916 --> 00:26:57,675
So you wouldn't? Anybody...

498
00:26:57,709 --> 00:27:00,053
Would you spend $100 to send a
message to anybody on Facebook?

499
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,263
You would. Yeah.

500
00:27:02,297 --> 00:27:04,307
'Cause you could write anything,
that's how I see it.

501
00:27:04,341 --> 00:27:06,560
Uh...

502
00:27:06,594 --> 00:27:10,313
So I, uh... sadly you can't
spend the money yet,

503
00:27:10,347 --> 00:27:15,068
but, um, to message people.
But I... I love that idea.

504
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:18,988
And, uh, I... so there's some...
there's two different kinds

505
00:27:19,022 --> 00:27:21,824
of celebrities on Facebook.
There's some that you can like,

506
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:23,326
and some that you can message.

507
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,994
Here's one that you can like.

508
00:27:25,028 --> 00:27:27,038
You can like Harrison Ford.

509
00:27:27,072 --> 00:27:29,082
But you can't be like,
"Harrison Ford!

510
00:27:29,116 --> 00:27:31,834
I would... I think that Han Solo
would win in an arm wrestle..."

511
00:27:31,868 --> 00:27:33,545
Like, he doesn't
wanna hear any...

512
00:27:33,579 --> 00:27:36,005
You can just like him,
and then walk away.

513
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:41,010
Someone with a very similar
style is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

514
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:43,388
You can like him,
but you can't be like,

515
00:27:43,422 --> 00:27:46,600
"Mahmoud, I have some
suggestions for you."

516
00:27:46,634 --> 00:27:49,936
He'd be like, "I'm not even
in charge anymore!"

517
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,939
"We don't care, Mahmoud.
You're the only one

518
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:54,882
we can remember!"

519
00:27:56,310 --> 00:28:00,447
Mahmoud weirdly
has 40,899 likes.

520
00:28:00,481 --> 00:28:03,991
I would get it if Mahmoud
had ten million likes,

521
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:06,536
or if he had, like, two likes,
and his parents were like,

522
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,980
"He's still our Mahmoud."

523
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:13,501
But there are some celebrities
on Facebook

524
00:28:13,535 --> 00:28:15,503
that you can like and message.

525
00:28:15,537 --> 00:28:17,464
This is one: Val Kilmer.

526
00:28:17,498 --> 00:28:19,132
- You can like and message...
- [cheering]

527
00:28:19,166 --> 00:28:22,827
Yeah. And so I did.

528
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:25,597
Here's the message I sent Val.

529
00:28:25,631 --> 00:28:29,309
"Hey, Val. I put my dick
in peanut butter.

530
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:33,087
Ha-ha! Great job in<i> Top Gun.</i>
Bye-bye.

531
00:28:34,473 --> 00:28:38,192
Eugene.

532
00:28:38,226 --> 00:28:43,239
P.S: Please send nude pics."

533
00:28:43,273 --> 00:28:45,575
I would definitely pay $100

534
00:28:45,609 --> 00:28:49,370
to know that Val Kilmer
was like...

535
00:28:49,404 --> 00:28:52,106
"Fine." Click.

536
00:28:54,576 --> 00:28:56,919
Another, uh... another person

537
00:28:56,953 --> 00:28:59,547
you can like and message

538
00:28:59,581 --> 00:29:02,925
- is, uh, John Boehner.
- [laughter]

539
00:29:02,959 --> 00:29:06,387
Yeah. That's the right reaction.

540
00:29:06,421 --> 00:29:08,014
It's good
that you can message him.

541
00:29:08,048 --> 00:29:10,433
And so I did.

542
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:14,521
And I would so pay $100
to know that he sat and read it.

543
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:16,439
And here's the message
I wrote John.

544
00:29:16,473 --> 00:29:18,733
"Hey, John.
My name is Eugene Mirman,

545
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,444
and I do the voice of Gene
on Fox's<i> Bob's Burgers.</i>

546
00:29:21,478 --> 00:29:24,113
I imagine you're job
must be super hard,

547
00:29:24,147 --> 00:29:26,240
and that people are blaming you
for things when you're just

548
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:29,118
trying to do the best you can.

549
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:32,455
If you ever want
to take LSD together,

550
00:29:32,489 --> 00:29:36,376
I can try to find some.

551
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:39,295
I only did it once 20 years ago
after a Lou Reed concert,

552
00:29:39,329 --> 00:29:43,550
but I think it'd be fun.

553
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:48,179
Do you want to go on a road trip
together sometime?

554
00:29:48,213 --> 00:29:50,598
If driving across the country
with a stranger

555
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:55,169
makes you nervous,
I'm happy to go on horseback.

556
00:29:56,430 --> 00:29:58,523
That way, if you
feel uncomfortable,

557
00:29:58,557 --> 00:30:02,843
you can gallop away,
no hard feelings."

558
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:08,099
[applause, cheering]

559
00:30:11,361 --> 00:30:13,996
Any questions so far?

560
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,040
[woman] Did he respond?

561
00:30:16,074 --> 00:30:18,626
You know, very sadly, no.

562
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:21,295
Same with the pastor.
I, like, specifically, like,

563
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:24,048
wrote in my email,
there's like a real place,

564
00:30:24,082 --> 00:30:25,550
and then nothing.
But no.

565
00:30:25,584 --> 00:30:27,427
John Boehner probably loves me,

566
00:30:27,461 --> 00:30:30,054
but can't tell me that.

567
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,599
He's probably like,
"This guy gets me.

568
00:30:32,633 --> 00:30:36,603
I'm not a square."

569
00:30:36,637 --> 00:30:38,646
Uh... I love...

570
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,315
I love the VU.

571
00:30:41,349 --> 00:30:44,068
- [man] Did you get my message?
- Did I get your message?

572
00:30:44,102 --> 00:30:45,445
[man] This morning
I sent you one.

573
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:47,280
- Oh!
- Yeah. It was like,

574
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:49,365
"I'm gonna smell you
real good tonight."

575
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,534
- Oh.
- It's a picture

576
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:54,537
of a different man, real buff,
and posing.

577
00:30:54,571 --> 00:30:56,581
- Yeah, yeah.
- [man] ? ?

578
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:59,417
So for those of you
who couldn't hear,

579
00:30:59,451 --> 00:31:02,587
his message is,
"Did you get my message?

580
00:31:02,621 --> 00:31:05,047
I sent it to you on Facebook.

581
00:31:05,081 --> 00:31:07,300
It's this morning.
It said,

582
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:09,761
'I'm gonna smell you
real good.'"

583
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:12,639
And then the profile picture
is of a taught man

584
00:31:12,673 --> 00:31:15,099
in his underwear. And you know
why I'm describing it

585
00:31:15,133 --> 00:31:17,310
so accurately,
I did get your message.

586
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:20,296
You fucking lunatic.

587
00:31:23,391 --> 00:31:25,192
Yeah, yeah.

588
00:31:25,226 --> 00:31:28,571
And, uh... yeah, no.

589
00:31:28,605 --> 00:31:32,225
Uh... I mean, first of all,
thanks.

590
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,663
I feel like the chances
of you getting to...

591
00:31:36,697 --> 00:31:42,168
...smell me real good
are... not likely.

592
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:45,797
I think smell the essence
of the theater, maybe...

593
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:47,381
Anyway, well thank you
for your message.

594
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:49,258
That's really kind of you,

595
00:31:49,292 --> 00:31:53,554
and I hope you never go
to prison.

596
00:31:53,588 --> 00:31:56,474
Or do anything that is
against the government's rules.

597
00:31:56,508 --> 00:31:59,001
With people.

598
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:04,315
See? And then with...
if you could pay money,

599
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:07,151
you'd definitely reach...
I look at this.

600
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:10,971
Anyway, great. Great.
Great, I'm glad I asked.

601
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:14,450
- Yes, sir?
- [man] I hear you recently

602
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:17,620
came across good advice...
to cut your illegitimate child

603
00:32:17,654 --> 00:32:20,331
in half, so what do I do
in that case?

604
00:32:20,365 --> 00:32:22,124
What would I do if someone
asked me to cut

605
00:32:22,158 --> 00:32:24,752
their baby in half? Uh...

606
00:32:24,786 --> 00:32:29,298
I guess, honestly, it would
depend on their religion.

607
00:32:29,332 --> 00:32:32,326
Like, if it's a Buddhist baby,
cut that shit in half.

608
00:32:34,254 --> 00:32:37,724
No, I would probably say, like,
"Don't cut your baby in half.

609
00:32:37,758 --> 00:32:42,395
But draw a line, or like put
masking tape down your baby.

610
00:32:42,429 --> 00:32:44,355
And then be like, 'This half
of the baby is mine!

611
00:32:44,389 --> 00:32:46,190
And this half of the baby
is yours!'

612
00:32:46,224 --> 00:32:47,859
And then definitely raise it

613
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:51,404
for its entire life
with masking tape on it,

614
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:54,699
and, like, bitterly fight
over how it's groomed

615
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,659
and everything."
That's my advice.

616
00:32:56,693 --> 00:32:58,327
But I don't have any children.

617
00:32:58,361 --> 00:33:00,329
And I believe it is legal

618
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:01,748
to put masking tape on a baby.

619
00:33:01,782 --> 00:33:03,958
But it is illegal to cut it.

620
00:33:03,992 --> 00:33:06,419
You see where I come in,
I'm really, like, I'm the...

621
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:09,547
I love the law! What?

622
00:33:09,581 --> 00:33:11,340
You could do whatever you want.

623
00:33:11,374 --> 00:33:13,300
You have a "get out
of hell free" card.

624
00:33:13,334 --> 00:33:15,803
Yeah. I don't believe in hell,

625
00:33:15,837 --> 00:33:20,808
but I do believe in, uh, jail
if you cut a person.

626
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:23,519
I definitely... nobody stands up
in court and goes,

627
00:33:23,553 --> 00:33:27,089
"No big deal!
I'm gonna be in heaven."

628
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:32,528
Few trials end that way.

629
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:37,408
Because of how no fun, uh,
prison is.

630
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:40,227
If<i> Oz</i> is even
40 percent accurate.

631
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:45,165
Never seen it,
imagine it's terrifying.

632
00:33:45,199 --> 00:33:47,794
Um... any other questions?

633
00:33:47,828 --> 00:33:50,254
- [woman] Why don't...
- Whoa! A lot of...

634
00:33:50,288 --> 00:33:52,506
We'll get to both of you.
Let's start with you.

635
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,467
[woman] Why don't you charge
people to message you?

636
00:33:54,501 --> 00:33:57,011
Why don't I charge people
to message me?

637
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:59,430
- [woman] Yeah.
- One, because I'm an angel.

638
00:33:59,464 --> 00:34:01,515
- [cheering]
- I don't know

639
00:34:01,549 --> 00:34:04,418
that I would get the money.

640
00:34:05,887 --> 00:34:08,856
But I think that if it cost,
like, three dollars

641
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,485
to message me, it would be
a bummer for all of us.

642
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,362
Like, I'd be a monster,
a monster with a taco,

643
00:34:15,396 --> 00:34:17,698
but a monster.

644
00:34:17,732 --> 00:34:19,826
I think if people knew
it was like for a taco fund,

645
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,703
then they'd be like,
"This guy's good."

646
00:34:22,737 --> 00:34:24,789
I don't... yeah, I don't know
who gets the money.

647
00:34:24,823 --> 00:34:27,416
Uh, so that's the answer
to that.

648
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:30,336
And I would never charge.
I would just not read a message.

649
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:32,338
But I wouldn't accept money
to read it.

650
00:34:32,372 --> 00:34:34,632
That sounds exhausting.

651
00:34:34,666 --> 00:34:36,592
And then from over here
there was a question?

652
00:34:36,626 --> 00:34:39,386
[man] Would you reply to
messages and/or send nude pics?

653
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:42,222
- [laughter]
- No nude pics.

654
00:34:42,256 --> 00:34:44,809
- [woman] Aw!
- Sor... sorry?

655
00:34:44,843 --> 00:34:46,936
[laughter]

656
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:48,479
- [man boos]
- I'm not even sure

657
00:34:48,513 --> 00:34:50,356
I'd accept nude pics,
let alone...

658
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:52,316
...send them. Uh...

659
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,443
And then would I reply
to messages?

660
00:34:54,477 --> 00:34:56,821
I do on occasion reply
to messages. Sure.

661
00:34:56,855 --> 00:34:59,782
Um, but I don't want it
to get out there,

662
00:34:59,816 --> 00:35:01,534
so I wouldn't wanna, I don't
know, say that on a TV special

663
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:04,662
or anything.

664
00:35:04,696 --> 00:35:06,998
So hopefully this whole part
will be just you beeped

665
00:35:07,032 --> 00:35:09,583
completely and then me beeped
completely, like...

666
00:35:09,617 --> 00:35:12,378
"I wonder what they said,
but he seems so friendly."

667
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:15,339
[man] You actually
replied to me.

668
00:35:15,373 --> 00:35:17,758
I replied to you. Yeah. Right?

669
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:19,593
See? That's proof.
I'll write Robin Hood back.

670
00:35:19,627 --> 00:35:22,513
- [cheering]
- Great.

671
00:35:22,547 --> 00:35:24,849
You probably said something
really normal,

672
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:26,851
you probably were like,
"I like your stuff

673
00:35:26,885 --> 00:35:28,519
and you're a nice person."
And I was like,

674
00:35:28,553 --> 00:35:30,730
"You're a nice person. Thanks."
Right?

675
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:32,732
Yeah, if you write, like,
"I'm crazy.

676
00:35:32,766 --> 00:35:35,317
I want to wash your shoes."

677
00:35:35,351 --> 00:35:38,571
You will never hear from me.

678
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:41,574
Like... but if you write, like,
"Hey, thanks.

679
00:35:41,608 --> 00:35:43,826
The thing that you said
that was funny made me happy,"

680
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,578
I'd be like, "Thank you."

681
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:47,454
'Cause I'm, uh,
what do you call it? Normal.

682
00:35:47,488 --> 00:35:50,499
Normal... I don't wanna start
a relationship

683
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,001
online with a lunatic.
And by relationship,

684
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:53,961
I mean any interaction.

685
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:58,883
Uh, one more question,
and then more stories. Anybody?

686
00:35:58,917 --> 00:35:59,967
[man] What's Neil deGrasse Tyson
like?

687
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,635
What's Neil deGrasse Tyson like?

688
00:36:01,669 --> 00:36:05,956
Uh, he is as soft
as a unicorn...

689
00:36:08,426 --> 00:36:11,395
...and as smart
as a million bumblebees!

690
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:13,272
But no, he's...

691
00:36:13,306 --> 00:36:15,108
He's, uh...

692
00:36:15,142 --> 00:36:17,944
His... the amount he knows
is like it's suspicious.

693
00:36:17,978 --> 00:36:20,529
It's like... yeah.

694
00:36:20,563 --> 00:36:22,698
He's... he's really sweet
and very...

695
00:36:22,732 --> 00:36:26,077
No, it's... no, he's too war...
like, warm and, like,

696
00:36:26,111 --> 00:36:29,538
uh, generous as a person
to be a robot.

697
00:36:29,572 --> 00:36:31,415
I think you yelled,
"Is he a robot?"

698
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:34,001
Otherwise, what I said
is just weird.

699
00:36:34,035 --> 00:36:36,670
Yeah, no, Neil is great.
He's, like, very sweet

700
00:36:36,704 --> 00:36:39,048
and knowledgeable to a fault.
No.

701
00:36:39,082 --> 00:36:42,468
[laughs] Knowledgeable
in an amazing way.

702
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:45,387
All right. Uh...
more jokey stories.

703
00:36:45,421 --> 00:36:49,583
- [cheering]
- Great!

704
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:57,524
I went, uh, last year

705
00:36:57,558 --> 00:37:00,486
to a music festival in Mexico,

706
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,614
uh, that is hosted by Peter
Buck, the guitarist of REM.

707
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:05,699
- And, uh... yeah.
- [scattered cheers]

708
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:08,161
I do things. Um...

709
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:10,830
And I'd never been to Mexico,
and the festival happens

710
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:13,499
at, uh, it's
in the Baja Peninsula.

711
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,584
It's in this small town
that's very lovely.

712
00:37:15,618 --> 00:37:19,172
And it happens literally
at the Hotel California.

713
00:37:19,206 --> 00:37:22,800
Which... which I think if you
work there must be exhausting,

714
00:37:22,834 --> 00:37:24,093
'cause people probably,
every time they arrive,

715
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:25,928
they must be like,

716
00:37:25,962 --> 00:37:29,849
"So I can check out
any time I like?"

717
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:34,979
And then the staff has to be,
like, "No, it's at noon."

718
00:37:35,013 --> 00:37:38,232
And then they bite down
on a cyanide capsule,

719
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:41,969
and kill themselves and a new
staff is hired every morning.

720
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,782
I... the first night
that, uh, that I was there,

721
00:37:46,816 --> 00:37:48,575
I went to this concert
on a beach.

722
00:37:48,609 --> 00:37:50,911
Uh, and I ate a wasp.

723
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:52,746
Just right away,
ate a wasp.

724
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,082
It was in a taco.
I didn't, like...

725
00:37:55,116 --> 00:37:57,626
...find a wasp on the ground.

726
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,795
And the taco they were serving,
I didn't find the taco

727
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:03,132
on the ground either.
It was, uh... very...

728
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,425
So I bit this taco,
and I was like,

729
00:38:05,459 --> 00:38:08,287
"This taco really hurts."

730
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:12,850
And I started looking
in the taco 'cause I was like,

731
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:15,769
"I wonder what hurts so much
in this taco."

732
00:38:15,803 --> 00:38:18,856
And, uh, like, I didn't know
what I thought I would find,

733
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:21,441
like, I'd find, like, tiny
Nicolas Cage and be like,

734
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,861
"What are you doing
in my taco?

735
00:38:23,895 --> 00:38:27,180
Shouldn't you be making
weird career decisions?"

736
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:31,077
But I found a wasp.

737
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,079
And I've never been, like,
so relieved to be like,

738
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:35,789
"Oh, thank God, just a wasp
stung my face.

739
00:38:35,823 --> 00:38:38,000
Everything's fine."

740
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:40,753
As my face swells. Um...

741
00:38:40,787 --> 00:38:42,713
But the thing that happened
that's super...

742
00:38:42,747 --> 00:38:45,299
that was super crazy was
the last night of the festival.

743
00:38:45,333 --> 00:38:47,218
The town's really small,
it's like, the downtown's

744
00:38:47,252 --> 00:38:49,011
like five blocks
by five blocks.

745
00:38:49,045 --> 00:38:50,971
And after the festival,
a bunch of people

746
00:38:51,005 --> 00:38:53,515
went from the concert
to Peter Buck's house

747
00:38:53,549 --> 00:38:55,976
around the corner,
and I found myself

748
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:58,187
at 3 in the morning
walking down this dirt road,

749
00:38:58,221 --> 00:39:02,316
just two blocks, uh,
to my hotel with Michael Stipe.

750
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:05,236
And we were... we were just
walking and sharing recipes

751
00:39:05,270 --> 00:39:07,571
and, you know, goofing around.
And I was teaching him

752
00:39:07,605 --> 00:39:10,032
Krav Maga, and...

753
00:39:10,066 --> 00:39:12,952
We were walking,
and, uh, about

754
00:39:12,986 --> 00:39:15,162
30 feet from the entrance
to our hotel,

755
00:39:15,196 --> 00:39:18,624
uh, in pitch black night,
three in the morning,

756
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:22,128
all of a sudden this SUV
screeches out of an alleyway

757
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:24,922
and stops in front of us,
and two Mexican policemen

758
00:39:24,956 --> 00:39:27,591
jumped out and started screaming
at me and Michael Stipe

759
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,635
in Spanish.

760
00:39:29,669 --> 00:39:31,929
I don't speak any Spanish.

761
00:39:31,963 --> 00:39:35,182
They spoke excellent Spanish.

762
00:39:35,216 --> 00:39:38,894
They're pointing at us,
and pointing at the SUV.

763
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:40,813
And we don't really know... we
know we've done nothing wrong.

764
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:42,064
We know we don't wanna go
on a whale watch.

765
00:39:42,098 --> 00:39:44,358
We don't know... and...

766
00:39:44,392 --> 00:39:46,068
And we sort of look at each
other and keep walking

767
00:39:46,102 --> 00:39:47,820
towards the hotel,
and then they put

768
00:39:47,854 --> 00:39:49,613
Michael Stipe's arm
behind his back,

769
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:51,115
like he's a criminal.
Not like he wrote

770
00:39:51,149 --> 00:39:53,575
"Everybody Hurts,"
but like a criminal.

771
00:39:53,609 --> 00:39:55,744
And they put his hands
on the SUV,

772
00:39:55,778 --> 00:39:57,704
and they start emptying
his pockets.

773
00:39:57,738 --> 00:39:59,873
And, uh, I'm at this point
staring at my phone,

774
00:39:59,907 --> 00:40:02,042
uh, mildly terrified.

775
00:40:02,076 --> 00:40:04,044
Wondering who I could call,
I can't call the police,

776
00:40:04,078 --> 00:40:06,088
they're already helping.

777
00:40:06,122 --> 00:40:08,048
Maybe I could call
John Hodgman.

778
00:40:08,082 --> 00:40:10,843
He would know what to do.

779
00:40:10,877 --> 00:40:14,805
And they put my hands
on the... on the SUV.

780
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:16,098
And they start emptying
my pockets. This is when

781
00:40:16,132 --> 00:40:18,267
I wish that I'd put, uh,

782
00:40:18,301 --> 00:40:20,102
brie, just not even
in cellophane,

783
00:40:20,136 --> 00:40:22,229
just brie in all my pockets.

784
00:40:22,263 --> 00:40:23,856
Just so when they reached in,
they'd pull out their hands

785
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,816
all wet and sticky.

786
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:27,818
I'm just like, "You fucked
with the wrong American!

787
00:40:27,852 --> 00:40:29,987
You fucked with the Cheese Man!"

788
00:40:30,021 --> 00:40:32,698
[applause]

789
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:35,826
And... start emptying stuff
they found:

790
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,038
a pill of Imodium A-D
that I was bringing to a friend.

791
00:40:39,072 --> 00:40:41,165
And they start waving it
in front of me,

792
00:40:41,199 --> 00:40:43,917
like they'd uncovered a plot
to kill the president.

793
00:40:43,951 --> 00:40:46,128
And they confiscated it.

794
00:40:46,162 --> 00:40:48,047
I hope they took it right
before they went to a party,

795
00:40:48,081 --> 00:40:50,449
and still have never shit.

796
00:40:52,126 --> 00:40:53,969
They... they also took out
my wallet

797
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:55,637
and they did what
I can only describe

798
00:40:55,671 --> 00:40:58,391
as just the shittiest
close-up magic

799
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:01,685
that I've ever seen,
where they're just doing this.

800
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:04,813
And at this point,
Michael Stipe's on his phone

801
00:41:04,847 --> 00:41:08,234
and he manages to text "help"
to Peter Buck's wife.

802
00:41:08,268 --> 00:41:12,471
And, it, autocorrects
to "hello."

803
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:17,659
"Hi, Michael.

804
00:41:17,693 --> 00:41:19,436
Thought you were
going to sleep."

805
00:41:20,863 --> 00:41:23,290
And, uh, finally they, uh,

806
00:41:23,324 --> 00:41:25,376
they give us, they let us
put everything in our pockets.

807
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:27,711
And then the whole time,
they're only speaking Spanish

808
00:41:27,745 --> 00:41:29,380
and, like, pointing.
And then finally, they, like,

809
00:41:29,414 --> 00:41:30,797
break into English,
but it's something weird.

810
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:32,299
Where they're just like, "Okay,

811
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:34,051
well, have fun in Mexico
and check out<i> The Wire,</i>

812
00:41:34,085 --> 00:41:35,344
it's a very good series,"
and like,

813
00:41:35,378 --> 00:41:37,430
you're just like, wait, what?
And...

814
00:41:37,464 --> 00:41:39,723
And then they jump in the SUV
and they screech off,

815
00:41:39,757 --> 00:41:43,018
just like normal policemen
would.

816
00:41:43,052 --> 00:41:45,729
And we're walking back
to the hotel,

817
00:41:45,763 --> 00:41:48,065
uh, you know, relieved
and terrified.

818
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:50,109
And I look in my wallet
and I realize

819
00:41:50,143 --> 00:41:51,985
they... they left
all the American money,

820
00:41:52,019 --> 00:41:53,404
but they stole a thousand pesos.

821
00:41:53,438 --> 00:41:54,780
They stole about
a hundred dollars.

822
00:41:54,814 --> 00:41:56,115
I was like, "Oh, my God!

823
00:41:56,149 --> 00:41:58,242
That was just
a really great mugging."

824
00:41:58,276 --> 00:42:00,077
What, like, uh...

825
00:42:00,111 --> 00:42:02,455
Like, what a super, like,
low-key,

826
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:04,957
nobody got hurt,
really just lovely mugging.

827
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:08,043
And, uh...

828
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:10,212
And I call, the next morning
I called my girlfriend,

829
00:42:10,246 --> 00:42:13,006
and I was like,
"Uh, so last night,

830
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,801
at three in the morning,
I was mugged

831
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:18,053
by the Mexican police,

832
00:42:18,087 --> 00:42:20,931
with Michael Stipe,

833
00:42:20,965 --> 00:42:24,893
and they stole, uh,
a hundred dollars."

834
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:27,396
And then she just kind of
pauses and goes,

835
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:30,966
"That story sounds like it's
worth about a hundred dollars."

836
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:35,971
- Fair enough.
- [applause]

837
00:42:41,902 --> 00:42:44,079
So last summer, uh,

838
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:46,873
I went to Portsmouth,
New Hampshire

839
00:42:46,907 --> 00:42:48,542
with my girlfriend,
we went, uh,

840
00:42:48,576 --> 00:42:50,294
it's a lovely sort of
seaside town.

841
00:42:50,328 --> 00:42:52,212
And we went and we rented a car

842
00:42:52,246 --> 00:42:54,256
and we parked it
in a parking garage

843
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,133
and we got a little ticket
that you put in the dashboard

844
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:58,344
and we did everything.
We walked around,

845
00:42:58,378 --> 00:43:01,180
and then when we got back
to the car,

846
00:43:01,214 --> 00:43:03,307
I saw there was a ticket
on the windshield.

847
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:06,018
And I was like, "What?"
How could I have...

848
00:43:06,052 --> 00:43:08,979
...parked wrong?
Like, I was so baffled.

849
00:43:09,013 --> 00:43:10,939
I was like, "What could this
possibly be for?"

850
00:43:10,973 --> 00:43:13,025
And I looked at the ticket,

851
00:43:13,059 --> 00:43:15,944
that I got there,
and the violation was

852
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:18,822
"parked in wrong direction."

853
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:22,201
Agreed.

854
00:43:22,235 --> 00:43:26,872
So... so we had backed...
we had backed the car up,

855
00:43:26,906 --> 00:43:30,083
uh, into the spot, which
apparently in New Hampshire

856
00:43:30,117 --> 00:43:32,919
is quite illegal.

857
00:43:32,953 --> 00:43:35,464
Um, and I looked at, like,
the thing that we put

858
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:38,217
in the dashboard to see
if there was any way

859
00:43:38,251 --> 00:43:40,260
we could have known this,
and the ticket says,

860
00:43:40,294 --> 00:43:42,762
"This ticket permits you
to park in accordance

861
00:43:42,796 --> 00:43:45,474
with the regulations."

862
00:43:45,508 --> 00:43:48,935
I think we all know
what those are.

863
00:43:48,969 --> 00:43:52,231
Who doesn't know the regulations
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire?

864
00:43:52,265 --> 00:43:54,941
"This ticket must
be displayed clearly

865
00:43:54,975 --> 00:43:59,154
on your vehicle dashboard and
the vehicle parked correctly."

866
00:43:59,188 --> 00:44:03,158
Two opportunities to say,
like...

867
00:44:03,192 --> 00:44:05,077
They mean don't back up
into a spot,

868
00:44:05,111 --> 00:44:06,953
'cause nobody would park
across three spots,

869
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:10,165
spray paint "fuck you"
on it and walk away.

870
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,043
So they literally mean
"don't back up."

871
00:44:13,077 --> 00:44:14,961
But they don't say it twice.

872
00:44:14,995 --> 00:44:18,465
I, uh, I became furious.

873
00:44:18,499 --> 00:44:23,011
The ticket was for $15.
I paid it right away. Uh...

874
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:26,014
But I was, like, "These people
are thieves.

875
00:44:26,048 --> 00:44:28,559
They're criminals."
I was so mad at them.

876
00:44:28,593 --> 00:44:30,227
'Cause there'd be no way
to know this law.

877
00:44:30,261 --> 00:44:31,520
And I was like,
I wonder how I could let

878
00:44:31,554 --> 00:44:33,813
Portsmouth know how disappointed

879
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:35,482
I am in them.

880
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:38,193
And so we had spent the day
walking around

881
00:44:38,227 --> 00:44:40,487
using this lovely harbor guide.

882
00:44:40,521 --> 00:44:43,657
Uh, full of, you know,
ads for seafood places,

883
00:44:43,691 --> 00:44:47,035
and whatnot, and I was like,
"Maybe I can take out

884
00:44:47,069 --> 00:44:49,622
a full page ad with a letter

885
00:44:49,656 --> 00:44:53,041
to them that would be there
for the year."

886
00:44:53,075 --> 00:44:55,419
So this is run
by the Chamber of Commerce,

887
00:44:55,453 --> 00:44:57,463
and I reached out to them and I
was like, "I'd love to take out

888
00:44:57,497 --> 00:44:59,673
a full page ad, it's about, uh,
it's a letter to your city

889
00:44:59,707 --> 00:45:02,301
about a ticket I got."
And they were literally like,

890
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:05,095
"Yes, let's do it."

891
00:45:05,129 --> 00:45:08,832
In the email:
hashtag "fearless."

892
00:45:13,012 --> 00:45:14,354
They were like,
"We'll publish your letter."

893
00:45:14,388 --> 00:45:16,022
I sent them the letter,

894
00:45:16,056 --> 00:45:18,900
next day, "Hey, uh,

895
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:21,236
we can't publish... We're...

896
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:23,530
We'll lose all the other
advertising."

897
00:45:23,564 --> 00:45:27,075
I was like, "Ah! But I really
want to let everybody know."

898
00:45:27,109 --> 00:45:32,164
So there's another independent
guide that's much bigger,

899
00:45:32,198 --> 00:45:34,541
that's distributed there.

900
00:45:34,575 --> 00:45:37,043
Uh, their summer guide.
It's all...

901
00:45:37,077 --> 00:45:39,296
Both are like for, like
the run of the year.

902
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,174
Like, they're all summer.
It's like for the whole time.

903
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:45,177
And I emailed them and I was
like, "Will you run my letter

904
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:48,096
to your city about how
mad I am at the parking there?"

905
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:52,100
And they were like, "Yes."

906
00:45:52,134 --> 00:45:54,603
So this summer there will be
a full page ad,

907
00:45:54,637 --> 00:45:56,689
along with restaurant
recommendations,

908
00:45:56,723 --> 00:46:00,233
of why I am mad
at the city of Portsmouth.

909
00:46:00,267 --> 00:46:03,903
And this is the letter
that will be a full page ad

910
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:07,199
for the entire summer.

911
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,493
As people are like, "Ooh, that
looks like a good lobster place.

912
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:12,896
Ooh, this comedian
is quite mad about a ticket.

913
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,903
He's willing to pay
a hundred times that ticket..."

914
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,256
Anyway, here's the letter
that will run.

915
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:25,551
"Dear Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
and especially

916
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:28,011
the Parking Clerk's Office,

917
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:30,305
last June I had a wonderful
day walking around

918
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:33,350
in your historic downtown
with my girlfriend.

919
00:46:33,384 --> 00:46:36,878
I bought two puppets,
who turned out to be gay.

920
00:46:39,348 --> 00:46:42,192
Just kidding. They're puppets.

921
00:46:42,226 --> 00:46:44,653
We stopped in cute shops,
ate a popover,

922
00:46:44,687 --> 00:46:47,639
and saw black David Cross.

923
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:54,271
It was nice.

924
00:46:55,322 --> 00:46:57,207
Then when we returned
to our car,

925
00:46:57,241 --> 00:46:59,167
on my windshield was a ticket.

926
00:46:59,201 --> 00:47:02,462
What could this possibly be for,
I thought.

927
00:47:02,496 --> 00:47:04,548
I paid for three hours
of parking,

928
00:47:04,582 --> 00:47:07,993
but only used two.
You're welcome, Portsmouth.

929
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:11,930
Is it a crime in Portsmouth
to not use all the parking

930
00:47:11,964 --> 00:47:13,390
you bought?

931
00:47:13,424 --> 00:47:16,518
How do you know I'd be back
early?

932
00:47:16,552 --> 00:47:20,773
Do you have
a pre-crime division?

933
00:47:20,807 --> 00:47:25,235
Why are your pre-cogs
working on traffic tickets?

934
00:47:25,269 --> 00:47:27,529
Shouldn't they be out preventing
street performers

935
00:47:27,563 --> 00:47:29,973
before they happen?

936
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:35,370
But no, I read the violation.
We backed into a spot

937
00:47:35,404 --> 00:47:40,166
and were fined $15 for being
'parked in the wrong direction.'

938
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:43,545
What kind of a horseshit charge
is that?

939
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:45,839
It's illegal to back
into a spot?

940
00:47:45,873 --> 00:47:48,592
Before I embarrass myself,
I just want to make sure

941
00:47:48,626 --> 00:47:51,428
that Portsmouth is still
inside the United States,

942
00:47:51,462 --> 00:47:54,831
and not considered a part
of Iran!

943
00:47:57,384 --> 00:48:00,520
You're probably thinking,
'Well, if before visiting

944
00:48:00,554 --> 00:48:02,522
Portsmouth, like everyone else,
you'd simply first gone

945
00:48:02,556 --> 00:48:04,817
to the city clerk's office
website,

946
00:48:04,851 --> 00:48:07,527
clicked on City of Portsmouth
ordinances,

947
00:48:07,561 --> 00:48:11,364
and looked in chapter seven,
vehicles, traffic and parking,

948
00:48:11,398 --> 00:48:15,201
right there in section 7.316,

949
00:48:15,235 --> 00:48:18,705
back to curb. It says no vehicle
shall remain backed up

950
00:48:18,739 --> 00:48:23,669
to the curb.' This is factually
accurate information.

951
00:48:23,703 --> 00:48:25,838
Similarly, if you had gone
to my website

952
00:48:25,872 --> 00:48:30,258
before I came to your city and
clicked on Eugene's ordinances,

953
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,678
you'd know that in chapter one
under 'Fuck you,

954
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:35,663
don't steal my money...'

955
00:48:37,633 --> 00:48:40,393
...in section 8.215 it says,

956
00:48:40,427 --> 00:48:43,522
'Fuck you,
don't steal my money!'"

957
00:48:43,556 --> 00:48:47,634
- [applause]
- Thanks.

958
00:48:52,565 --> 00:48:55,116
"But even if I had
gone to your website,

959
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,202
it states that
the online ordinances

960
00:48:57,236 --> 00:49:00,079
are not an official copy.

961
00:49:00,113 --> 00:49:02,374
That for the official
ordinances,

962
00:49:02,408 --> 00:49:06,336
I have to call 610-7245.

963
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:09,422
Why no area code?

964
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:14,678
Am I calling from
a local land line in 1986?

965
00:49:14,712 --> 00:49:18,306
But instead I foolishly
looked around for signs,

966
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:21,209
both real and from God.

967
00:49:23,303 --> 00:49:25,188
I saw nothing.

968
00:49:25,222 --> 00:49:27,357
But I heard God's voice
and he said,

969
00:49:27,391 --> 00:49:31,444
'This is fucking bullshit.

970
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:34,865
You need
to write them a letter.'

971
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:38,326
Lastly, as you know,
New Hampshire's state motto

972
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,287
is General John Stark's
celebrated quote,

973
00:49:41,321 --> 00:49:44,917
'Live free or die.'

974
00:49:44,951 --> 00:49:48,253
Which he famously said
before attempting

975
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,407
the first recorded self BJ.

976
00:49:59,256 --> 00:50:01,433
If John Stark was alive today,

977
00:50:01,467 --> 00:50:04,519
he would be 287 years old.

978
00:50:04,553 --> 00:50:07,272
Also, right after learning
about cars,

979
00:50:07,306 --> 00:50:10,191
General Stark would then
be disgusted

980
00:50:10,225 --> 00:50:13,653
to discover Portsmouth
doesn't even give people

981
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:16,782
the freedom to back
into a spot.

982
00:50:16,816 --> 00:50:19,785
Which, by your own state's
twisted logic,

983
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:22,328
turns my $15 ticket

984
00:50:22,362 --> 00:50:25,440
into a fight to the death!

985
00:50:26,742 --> 00:50:29,252
With great disappointment,
Eugene Mirman."

986
00:50:29,286 --> 00:50:32,364
- [applause, cheering]
- Thanks.

987
00:50:36,543 --> 00:50:38,595
Um, any questions still?

988
00:50:38,629 --> 00:50:40,680
[man] How much did it cost?

989
00:50:40,714 --> 00:50:42,348
How much did it cost?

990
00:50:42,382 --> 00:50:46,060
Uh... I think it was...

991
00:50:46,094 --> 00:50:48,187
That's funny, 'cause I'm just
trying to figure out the exact...

992
00:50:48,221 --> 00:50:51,441
It was like $1560 or so.

993
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:54,694
[laughter]

994
00:50:54,728 --> 00:50:58,056
Is that... is that a lot
or a little?

995
00:50:59,316 --> 00:51:01,284
- 'Cause...
- [man] This is a free show.

996
00:51:01,318 --> 00:51:02,744
- Say it again.
- [man] This is a free show.

997
00:51:02,778 --> 00:51:04,788
Yeah, but when it gets
on television,

998
00:51:04,822 --> 00:51:07,582
I'll definitely make
at least $1500, so...

999
00:51:07,616 --> 00:51:11,903
- [applause]
- I'll break even.

1000
00:51:13,372 --> 00:51:16,508
You would be shocked
at the number of things I do

1001
00:51:16,542 --> 00:51:19,911
where I'm like, "Oh,
I guess it'll break even."

1002
00:51:21,005 --> 00:51:23,807
Um, yeah, no, I guess that's...
I don't know.

1003
00:51:23,841 --> 00:51:26,501
To make fun of a city
for a whole summer?

1004
00:51:27,928 --> 00:51:30,438
And really not even the city,
they're partly...

1005
00:51:30,472 --> 00:51:32,398
The funny thing is, is I was...
So I was...

1006
00:51:32,432 --> 00:51:33,566
I think I just forgot
to mention,

1007
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,986
I was there one week ago today.

1008
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,780
And I did this bit
and then that's how, like,

1009
00:51:38,814 --> 00:51:40,949
I got in touch with everybody
to get these ads

1010
00:51:40,983 --> 00:51:44,077
in their papers,
and they had had...

1011
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:47,789
Parking is their, like,
that's their number one battle.

1012
00:51:47,823 --> 00:51:51,543
Like, you know how some places
are mad at taxes or marriage?

1013
00:51:51,577 --> 00:51:55,922
New Hampshire only argues
about parking.

1014
00:51:55,956 --> 00:51:59,051
They get their cars, like,
booted for $5 tickets.

1015
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:01,803
I didn't know. I had struck
a chord that goes...

1016
00:52:01,837 --> 00:52:05,098
...that is as important, like,
the way abortion is some places,

1017
00:52:05,132 --> 00:52:09,061
they're like,
"You can't park in the what?"

1018
00:52:09,095 --> 00:52:12,505
They don't care about nothing
but parking.

1019
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:16,609
Um... [laughs]

1020
00:52:16,643 --> 00:52:19,071
Anyway, it was totally worth it.

1021
00:52:19,105 --> 00:52:21,781
I was so excited to... I knew
that the other people

1022
00:52:21,815 --> 00:52:24,701
would never let me run the ad,
though they wrote me "fearless."

1023
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:26,661
And I was like, "Hey, can I pay
for this now?"

1024
00:52:26,695 --> 00:52:28,413
Like, I wanted
to like definitely...

1025
00:52:28,447 --> 00:52:30,623
Anyway, it's good.
Great part, great...

1026
00:52:30,657 --> 00:52:32,834
If... you know, if you don't
know anything about standup,

1027
00:52:32,868 --> 00:52:35,837
always end a bit that does well
with just a ramble-y thing

1028
00:52:35,871 --> 00:52:39,424
that kind of...
kind of goes to nowhere.

1029
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:41,634
But is mildly informative.

1030
00:52:41,668 --> 00:52:45,638
So, uh, so there's a Whole Foods

1031
00:52:45,672 --> 00:52:48,516
that opened by my house
a little while ago.

1032
00:52:48,550 --> 00:52:50,602
And when a Whole Foods opens,

1033
00:52:50,636 --> 00:52:53,063
they really try to ingratiate
themselves on the community,

1034
00:52:53,097 --> 00:52:55,607
and they, you know,
source locally and all that.

1035
00:52:55,641 --> 00:52:58,359
But they also try to really
get in with artists

1036
00:52:58,393 --> 00:53:00,403
and various other
sort of things.

1037
00:53:00,437 --> 00:53:02,781
And one of the things they kept
talking about

1038
00:53:02,815 --> 00:53:05,408
is how they were gonna display
the artwork of local artists

1039
00:53:05,442 --> 00:53:06,701
and have all these
artist events.

1040
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:08,578
And I don't paint,

1041
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:09,495
but then when I saw that,
I was like,

1042
00:53:09,529 --> 00:53:11,790
"I paint."

1043
00:53:11,824 --> 00:53:14,709
And I became obsessed
with having a gallery show

1044
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:17,629
at Whole Foods.

1045
00:53:17,663 --> 00:53:20,132
And so I made a bunch
of paintings that I believe

1046
00:53:20,166 --> 00:53:23,551
are quite locally themed,
and, uh...

1047
00:53:23,585 --> 00:53:26,054
And then even I got to do it
on Seth Meyers,

1048
00:53:26,088 --> 00:53:27,555
where I was like,
"Here are some paintings.

1049
00:53:27,589 --> 00:53:29,515
I'd love to display them
at Whole Foods."

1050
00:53:29,549 --> 00:53:31,476
And then Whole Foods
very begrudgingly was like,

1051
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:34,938
"Yeah, let's talk about it."

1052
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:38,108
And then set a meeting
that never quite happened,

1053
00:53:38,142 --> 00:53:41,153
but I have not given up.
My paintings...

1054
00:53:41,187 --> 00:53:43,488
I only want to display them
at Whole Foods.

1055
00:53:43,522 --> 00:53:46,491
I don't want to be displayed...
I don't want... That's...

1056
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:50,495
That's my,
that's where my art lives.

1057
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:53,706
So I made a bunch of paintings
and I want to show them to you,

1058
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,694
- uh, and get them...
- [cheering, applause]

1059
00:54:05,002 --> 00:54:08,805
So each painting has a title...

1060
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:11,683
...that I believe is inspired
by, you know,

1061
00:54:11,717 --> 00:54:14,853
where I live and who I am.

1062
00:54:14,887 --> 00:54:17,939
This is called, uh,

1063
00:54:17,973 --> 00:54:23,135
"Gender Neutral Child Learning
About the Conflict in Syria."

1064
00:54:29,568 --> 00:54:31,870
This is, uh,

00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:25,573
- Thank you.
- [applause]

1074
00:55:28,335 --> 00:55:32,288
I could really see that
right by the broccoli rabe.

1075
00:55:33,590 --> 00:55:36,017

- Thanks.
- [cheering, applause]

1078
00:55:51,275 --> 00:55:54,702
So, uh, I want
to do one final thing.

1079
00:55:54,736 --> 00:55:57,747
And, um, I, uh...

1080
00:55:57,781 --> 00:55:59,624
So I filled out a thing online

1081
00:55:59,658 --> 00:56:01,876
where I became a minister

1082
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:04,003
and can marry people,

1083
00:56:04,037 --> 00:56:06,131
in 40 of the 50 states.

1084
00:56:06,165 --> 00:56:09,259
I don't know which 40,
but chances are...

1085
00:56:09,293 --> 00:56:13,221
...this is one of them
because that's how chances work.

1086
00:56:13,255 --> 00:56:15,640
So I'm wondering
if there's a couple here

1087
00:56:15,674 --> 00:56:17,976
that's been in a relationship
for a long time,

1088
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,229
and would like, uh,
me to marry them onstage.

1089
00:56:21,263 --> 00:56:24,023
[scattered cheering]

1090
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:26,318
You guys would? Who else?

1091
00:56:26,352 --> 00:56:28,653
Are you guys... are you...
How long have you been

1092
00:56:28,687 --> 00:56:31,572
- in a relationship?
- A bit over a year.

1093
00:56:31,606 --> 00:56:34,742
- A bit over a year?
- [laughter]

1094
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:37,353
How serious are you guys?

1095
00:56:42,909 --> 00:56:45,003
What are you gonna say?

1096
00:56:45,037 --> 00:56:46,879
It would be really funny
if you were like, "I don't know

1097
00:56:46,913 --> 00:56:49,632
we're going through
a rough thing. I'd really...

1098
00:56:49,666 --> 00:56:52,969
Like, I love hooking up
with strangers at McDonald's.

1099
00:56:53,003 --> 00:56:56,097
But I do also really love her,
so..."

1100
00:56:56,131 --> 00:56:58,266
Uh, all right,
if you guys are serious,

1101
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:00,810
you seem both...
you seem shy in a way

1102
00:57:00,844 --> 00:57:04,105
that this will be good,
and you seem, uh, intelligent.

1103
00:57:04,139 --> 00:57:06,316
Let's do this.
You seem nice.

1104
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:10,428
- You have a great look.
- [cheering]

1105
00:57:16,776 --> 00:57:19,604
Let's get them some microphones.

1106
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,082
Normally...

1107
00:57:23,116 --> 00:57:25,710
This is probably the first time
I married a couple

1108
00:57:25,744 --> 00:57:27,670
that have been together
for only a year.

1109
00:57:27,704 --> 00:57:29,714
But I will say this:
you seem genuinely in love

1110
00:57:29,748 --> 00:57:32,925
- and genuinely anxious.
- [laughter]

1111
00:57:32,959 --> 00:57:35,761
Um, so here, we've marked...
Here, come over here.

1112
00:57:35,795 --> 00:57:37,013
There's little "x's"
right there.

1113
00:57:37,047 --> 00:57:38,639
Each of you can stand on them.

1114
00:57:38,673 --> 00:57:39,974
We knew we were
gonna marry someone,

1115
00:57:40,008 --> 00:57:41,684
we just didn't know
who they'd be.

1116
00:57:41,718 --> 00:57:42,643
Oh, you wore flip-flops
to your wedding. Wow.

1117
00:57:42,677 --> 00:57:45,212
Okay.

1118
00:57:46,890 --> 00:57:48,858
All right. Well...
What are your names?

1119
00:57:48,892 --> 00:57:51,736
- Sasha.
- Sasha? Okay.

1120
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,905
- Logan.
- Logan and Sasha.

1121
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:57,558
Shouldn't you
be living in Brooklyn?

1122
00:58:01,821 --> 00:58:04,123
Great. Um, all right.
So this is gonna be

1123
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:06,584
in the classic "I do" format,
where I'll say a vow

1124
00:58:06,618 --> 00:58:08,502
and you just say "I do."

1125
00:58:08,536 --> 00:58:10,255
Great.

1126
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:12,215
I like that you're
holding hands.

1127
00:58:12,249 --> 00:58:13,799
[woman in audience]
Aww.

1128
00:58:13,833 --> 00:58:16,844
You're both, uh, what do you
guys do for... for a living?

1129
00:58:16,878 --> 00:58:18,846
We're both
illustration students.

1130
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,348
Both illustration students?
Oh.

1131
00:58:20,382 --> 00:58:24,585
- Art school.
- And you agree? Okay. He agrees.

1132
00:58:25,804 --> 00:58:28,356
That is...

1133
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:32,318
You answered that
adorably terrified.

1134
00:58:32,352 --> 00:58:34,653
All right. There is...

1135
00:58:34,687 --> 00:58:37,240
I would put it
at 15 percent chance

1136
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:39,433
that this is legally binding.

1137
00:58:41,278 --> 00:58:44,163
Once they told me that
I was... could do it,

1138
00:58:44,197 --> 00:58:47,650
I was sort of like, great.
Never looked into the details.

1139
00:58:48,868 --> 00:58:51,087
Let's do this, Logan and Sasha.

1140
00:58:51,121 --> 00:58:52,797
Is it like owning

1141
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:54,173
- part of the moon?
- Say it again?

1142
00:58:54,207 --> 00:58:55,133
It's like owning part
of the moon.

1143
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:56,175
It's like owning part

1144
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,344
of the moon? What was...

1145
00:58:58,378 --> 00:58:59,887
It's like you're not really sure
if it's legal to do that.

1146
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:02,014
Oh, yeah.

1147
00:59:02,048 --> 00:59:06,293
[laughter, applause]

1148
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:12,066
I would say that this is more
legal than if you bought

1149
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:14,819
- some of the moon.
- All right.

1150
00:59:14,853 --> 00:59:16,404
- Like on a scale of one...
- I would say if you own

1151
00:59:16,438 --> 00:59:19,615
a little of the moon,
you don't own any of the moon.

1152
00:59:19,649 --> 00:59:22,410
Oh, okay.

1153
00:59:22,444 --> 00:59:24,287
- There goes...
- But I like that you make

1154
00:59:24,321 --> 00:59:27,982
fast tangential connections.

1155
00:59:30,869 --> 00:59:32,795
You couldn't tell me
what you did,

1156
00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:35,840
but when it came time
for a moon joke,

1157
00:59:35,874 --> 00:59:37,675
you were right there.

1158
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:40,803
All right.

1159
00:59:40,837 --> 00:59:42,888
Let's do this, Logan, Sasha.

1160
00:59:42,922 --> 00:59:45,416
Let's get married.

1161
00:59:46,801 --> 00:59:48,227
All right.
Dear friends and family,

1162
00:59:48,261 --> 00:59:50,104
we are gathered here to witness,

1163
00:59:50,138 --> 00:59:52,631
like a car accident...

1164
00:59:53,975 --> 00:59:56,277
...the union of Sasha and Logan,

1165
00:59:56,311 --> 01:00:00,072
who probably love each other
very much.

1166
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:02,783
In the years they've been
together, their love has grown,

1167
01:00:02,817 --> 01:00:06,162
like a teenager's boner.

1168
01:00:06,196 --> 01:00:08,914
Confused but excited because
of something on the ground

1169
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:11,776
that reminded him of breasts.

1170
01:00:13,036 --> 01:00:14,379
All right, Logan.

1171
01:00:14,413 --> 01:00:16,381
This is the first vow.

1172
01:00:16,415 --> 01:00:18,341
You can just say "I do."

1173
01:00:18,375 --> 01:00:22,094
I promise to love you
for a very, very long time.

1174
01:00:22,128 --> 01:00:24,514
- I do.
- Great.

1175
01:00:24,548 --> 01:00:28,267
Sasha. I promise to let you
squeeze my breasts

1176
01:00:28,301 --> 01:00:31,270
in a way I don't really like
but you seem to enjoy.

1177
01:00:31,304 --> 01:00:34,340
I do.

1178
01:00:38,353 --> 01:00:41,806
[cheering, applause]

1179
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:46,952
Well, I see I've uncovered
a layer of the onion

1180
01:00:46,986 --> 01:00:49,438
that is Logan.

1181
01:00:52,117 --> 01:00:53,501
All right, Logan?

1182
01:00:53,535 --> 01:00:55,503
I promise to ask your permission

1183
01:00:55,537 --> 01:00:58,797
before I do anything
involving your butt.

1184
01:00:58,831 --> 01:01:01,259
- I do.
- Great.

1185
01:01:01,293 --> 01:01:04,053
Modern man, totally with it.

1186
01:01:04,087 --> 01:01:07,014
Okay, Sasha. I promise
to get mad at you

1187
01:01:07,048 --> 01:01:09,434
for no reason and then ask you
to run errands for me.

1188
01:01:09,468 --> 01:01:12,937
- I do.
- Good.

1189
01:01:12,971 --> 01:01:16,399
Logan, I promise to bottle up
my feelings

1190
01:01:16,433 --> 01:01:19,735
and get mad at you for hiding
things I've actually misplaced.

1191
01:01:19,769 --> 01:01:23,030
- I do.
- Good.

1192
01:01:23,064 --> 01:01:25,766
Wow, it's like I live
with you guys.

1193
01:01:27,152 --> 01:01:30,037
Okay, Sasha.
I promise not to imagine

1194
01:01:30,071 --> 01:01:31,539
Ryan Gosling
when we're making love,

1195
01:01:31,573 --> 01:01:34,041
or as Ryan would call it,
"fucking."

1196
01:01:34,075 --> 01:01:36,794
- I do.
- Great.

1197
01:01:36,828 --> 01:01:38,921
Not so hard for you.

1198
01:01:38,955 --> 01:01:40,548
All right. Logan.

1199
01:01:40,582 --> 01:01:42,716
I promise to love you forever
and never ever

1200
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:45,386
make a weird deal on a trade
with someone to murder you!

1201
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:48,264
- I do.
- Great.

1202
01:01:48,298 --> 01:01:52,477
So far, you're making
all the right choices.

1203
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,563
Sasha. I promise to love you
forever and share my thoughts

1204
01:01:55,597 --> 01:01:58,941
and feelings and never cut your
penis off in your sleep.

1205
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:01,653
- I do.
- Great.

1206
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:03,971
Sometimes people have trouble
with that one.

1207
01:02:05,565 --> 01:02:08,618
You rightfully don't.
All right. Last vow.

1208
01:02:08,652 --> 01:02:10,953
Do you both promise
to build a future together

1209
01:02:10,987 --> 01:02:12,622
that will be unshakeable
even by the anger

1210
01:02:12,656 --> 01:02:14,499
of the new gods
and the old gods?!

1211
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:17,585
- I do!
- I do!

1212
01:02:17,619 --> 01:02:19,378
Great. You may now hug or kiss,

1213
01:02:19,412 --> 01:02:21,631
whatever you're
comfortable with.

1214
01:02:21,665 --> 01:02:25,050
- [cheering, applause]
- Yay! I now pronounce you

1215
01:02:25,084 --> 01:02:28,513
- husband and wife.
- [cheering]

1216
01:02:28,547 --> 01:02:34,185
By all the power invested in me
by the Internet!

1217
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:37,605
Thank you very, very much.
Thank you so much, Sasha.

1218
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:39,898
Thank you very much, Logan.

1219
01:02:39,932 --> 01:02:42,901
You can give them...

1220
01:02:42,935 --> 01:02:45,154
Well, there you have it.

1221
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:48,157
- [cheering]
- Two young angels.

1222
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:51,685
[applause]

1223
01:02:54,364 --> 01:02:57,375
Married. That's really,
that's the show.

1224
01:02:57,409 --> 01:03:00,461
That's all of it, I marry
people, that's the whole thing.

1225
01:03:00,495 --> 01:03:04,048
Thank you guys so very much.
So fun.

1226
01:03:04,082 --> 01:03:06,300
Tucson,
you're the most wonderful.

1227
01:03:06,334 --> 01:03:09,261
Thank you, everybody.
Good night!

1228
01:03:09,295 --> 01:03:12,473
Bye-bye. Thank you.

1229
01:03:12,507 --> 01:03:16,919
[cheering, applause]

1230
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:50,177
[playing upbeat melody]

1231
01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:54,206
- [all whooping, shouting]
- [gunshots]

1232
01:04:09,564 --> 01:04:12,157
Well, let's go forward.

1233
01:04:12,191 --> 01:04:14,619
And, uh, lightly.

1234
01:04:14,653 --> 01:04:17,162
Let's see if we can't
walk into a tree slowly.

1235
01:04:17,196 --> 01:04:19,498
- Okay, you're doing great...
- Duck forward, duck forward.

1236
01:04:19,532 --> 01:04:21,667
- Duck forward!
- Duck forward.

1237
01:04:21,701 --> 01:04:23,335
Don't lean back,
don't lean back.

1238
01:04:23,369 --> 01:04:25,713
- Come here. Lean towards me.
- Oh!

1239
01:04:25,747 --> 01:04:29,801
- [Eugene laughing] Okay.
- [man laughs]

1240
01:04:29,835 --> 01:04:32,678
- [both laughing]
- You're doing great, Button.

1241
01:04:32,712 --> 01:04:35,765
Don't worry about it.
I'm not mad at you.

1242
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:38,684
But I definitely accidentally
walked into a tree.

1243
01:04:38,718 --> 01:04:40,603
- But it's fine.
- Well, I tried to pull you

1244
01:04:40,637 --> 01:04:41,729
- out of the tree.
- I like that we're in a field,

1245
01:04:41,763 --> 01:04:44,649
and I walked into the only tree

1246
01:04:44,683 --> 01:04:46,758
in this field.

1247
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:51,092
