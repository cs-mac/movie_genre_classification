1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,050
It was in the year of 1933

2
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,967
and Grace and her father were heading
southward with their army of gangsters

3
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,410
After Ieaving Dogville
they had returned to Denver

4
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,521
only to find that the mice had been well
and truly playing while the cat was away

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,283
and new forces had taken
over their former possessions

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,482
The result was a particularly
unappealing retreat

7
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,883
that had brought them through
the state ofAlabama this spring

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,850
in search of new hunting grounds

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,526
No, they will not
admit it! But it's a fact!

10
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,004
Deep down inside there isn't a woman
alive who doesn't nurture these fantasies

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,961
whether they involve harems

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,207
or being hunted through the
jungle by torch-bearing natives

13
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,561
however much they go on and on about
civilization and democracy sexy it ain't!

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,841
Grace and her father had
resumed their Iegendary discord

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,685
even as they pulled out of Dogville

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,406
and although Grace had
been employing the technique

17
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,884
of Ietting things go in one ear and out
the other for a pretty Iong time now

18
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,922
she was, to be frank, somewhat weary
of her unbearably overweening daddy

19
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,850
who still believed any nagging woman could be
pacified with the good old bouquet of carnations

20
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,247
I bet you wouldn't have had the guts
to talk Iike that if mother had been alive

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,406
No, you are right, my girl, I would not!

22
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,244
we're going, boss

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,648
Miss, Lady, can I talk
to you? Can I talk to you?

24
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,251
Yes?

25
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,247
They going whip him! I knew they would!
Itjust ain't true! He ain't stole nothing!

26
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,848
They put that Rhenish wine
from Mam's bedside table in his cabin

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,446
just to give 'em somethin'
to whip him for! That's the Iaw

28
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,206
One bottle and it's a whippin',
that's "Mam's Law!"

29
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,007
what are you talking about?
who... who are they going to whip?

30
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,367
- Timothy!
- why?

31
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,607
That's how they do us slaves...

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,728
- SIaves?
- Yes, Ma'am

33
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,447
Surely you've heard of slaves?

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,001
That's what we is at Manderlay

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,328
this godforsaken place!

36
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,681
That's how I got out, when a whippin's in
the offin' they take out a section of the fence

37
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,210
Listen, Grace! It's a Iocal matter
and it's not for us to poke our noses in

38
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,250
why should we not "poke our noses in",
just because it's a Iocal matter?

39
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,765
It's certainly not our responsibility

40
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,241
You think the Negroes wanted
to Ieave their homes in Africa?!

41
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,368
wasn't it us who
brought them to America?

42
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:47,401
we have done them a great wrong, it's our
abuse that has made them what they are

43
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,364
Untie him!

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,970
Stop!

45
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:39,370
'Fraid not, Iady! SIavery was
abolished seventy years ago

46
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:45,282
Ifyou won't obey that Iaw ofyour
own accord, we will compel you to do so!

47
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,568
Mam! Help me get her inside!

48
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,041
water for Mam! Quickly

49
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,043
Spare me your hypocrisy,
you dumb old slave!

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,607
Get out, Ieave us alone!

51
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,083
Ifyou're Iooking for sympathy,
don't expect any from me

52
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,240
Listen, I'm very old

53
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,123
and unfortunately, dying

54
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,004
I should Iike to ask you for a favor

55
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,289
If it involves allowing you to go
on exploiting these people Iike slaves

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,727
I'm sorry, I'II just have to say no

57
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,530
- No matter how "dying" you are
- SIavery is over now, I can see that

58
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,807
It had to come one day

59
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,650
All right, I'II probably refuse
you, but you might as well ask

60
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:14,089
There's a book,
it's under my mattress

61
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,881
I should Iike you to
retrieve it and burn it for me

62
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,087
- It would be best for everyone
- I'm sure you think so!

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,801
But it's my view that anything no matter what, is
best served by being brought out into the open

64
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,370
I beg you, one woman to another

65
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,162
woman to woman,
makes no difference to me

66
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,408
the sins of the past are sins I cannot
and do not wish to help you erase

67
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,208
And now I must Ieave you, I believe
my father's men have unlocked the gate

68
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,489
so now everybody can
come and go as they please

69
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,486
PIease Iet everyone else
know on the plantation

70
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:08,089
that from now on they can all enjoy the same
freedoms as any other citizen of this country

71
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,210
And the Constitution can
be found at any courthouse

72
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,931
And here's a tip for
when you sue the family

73
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,646
there's a weighty written evidence
concealed in this very room

74
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,969
She's dead

75
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,687
The old devil!

76
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,042
Oh, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it, Missy!

77
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,486
No, no, if any of us deserves
an apology it's not me!

78
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,844
I'm afraid

79
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:27,167
There's nothing to be afraid of!
we've taken all the family's weapons!

80
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,970
No

81
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,040
I'm afraid ofwhat will happen now

82
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,571
I fear we ain't ready for
a completely new way of Iife

83
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:50,805
At Manderlay, we
slaves took supper at 7

84
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,605
when do people take
supper when they are free?

85
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,361
we don't know these things

86
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,925
Free men eat when they're hungry

87
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,881
free women, as welI

88
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,049
Considering the times and the situation

89
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,047
Grace's words in the dead woman's
room on meal times for free citizens

90
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,090
might have seemed a trifle over-spirited

91
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,807
we should not believe that there
Iay any contempt in these words

92
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:37,248
for the wretched and
starving people ofAmerica

93
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,721
Grace rejoined the gangsters

94
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,205
who had indeed concluded their disarmament
of the plantation's powers-that-had-been

95
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:53,051
though their findings were meager:
the shot gun, and an old toy pistoI

96
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,522
All right, we can go

97
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,685
No, Iet's just wait a moment!

98
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,368
what are you waiting for?

99
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,847
For them to come and thank you?

100
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,601
Or for them to burn
the whole place down

101
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,162
and dance some tribal dance on
the ruins by the glow of the torchlight?

102
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,244
You are a bigot, daddy
and you always have been

103
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,846
we owe these people we
brought them here, we abused them

104
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,005
- we made them what they are!
- I admit, I don't do deals with the Japs

105
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,482
You can't trust them when there's
big money at stake, but a bigot?

106
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,688
- why don't they come out?
- That's exactly what you said Iast time!

107
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,089
- Last time?
- Remember when you were six

108
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,368
you thought it was so sad that your
beloved Tweety was all shut up in a cage

109
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,410
and nobody could persuade
you not to Iet him out

110
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,244
Tweety was a proud Iittle bird

111
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,847
well, his dignified exit didn't
do Tweety a hell of a Iot of good

112
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,401
we found him the next
morning underneath your window

113
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,449
- Frozen to death
- I know

114
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,321
he'd been bred as an indoor bird,
he really didn't have a chance

115
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,245
And what do you think
those Negroes in there are?

116
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:11,201
How many generations do you think those
families made their homes behind that fence?

117
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,162
I bet you most of them have taken up
employment in their former jobs with the family

118
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,731
contracts and alI

119
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,124
Of course now they'II get a few dollars
for their efforts, but they'II soon drink that up

120
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,245
and maybe they'II borrow
a bit more from their employers

121
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,804
who have, no doubt, opened a Iittle
store full of colorful wares just for them

122
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:36,244
And of course they'II never be able to pay
back the money and they'II be trapped yet again

123
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,449
what you did was
all very noble, my girl, but...

124
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:47,005
when push comes to shove you've just made
everything far worse, just as you did with Tweety

125
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,685
So all we can do
is hope there's no frost

126
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,083
what you said about
contracts and Ioans

127
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,681
- That's fraud!
- Fraud?

128
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,010
- See, I've read that freed slaves
- Yes

129
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,084
- Are given a mule and a plot of Iand
- Yes

130
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,969
- So that they can establish themselves
- Yes

131
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,168
Yep, that's true,
but when it came down to it

132
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,325
the fellow who owned the mule and
the Iand had rather keep it all for himself

133
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,209
so nothing really ever happened with it

134
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:27,003
Anyhow, it may take them a while to
gather the evidence against the plantation

135
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,401
for when the family goes on trial...

136
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,531
Trial?

137
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,046
There are times when you seem
even Iess with it than your dear mother!

138
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,930
No, I seem to have
underestimated 'em

139
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,526
we've at Ieast one man with
a genuine thirst for freedom

140
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,081
And he's gettin' out,
and he's in a hurry

141
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,005
Yeah, he's high tailin' it, all right

142
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,446
Yeah, it's Gramps!

143
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,601
Pardon me

144
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,003
Not a Iot of dignity there...
he's scared out of his wits!

145
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,443
would it be possible to have
a word with the young Iady?

146
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:10,251
Yes, yes

147
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,084
Don't mean to inconvenience you

148
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,571
That's exactly what you're doing

149
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,408
You're not inconveniencing anyone, this
is a grave day for everyone, I know that!

150
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,610
I just thought we must have
seemed a might bit ungratefuI

151
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:26,082
we should Iike to thank
you properly for what you've done

152
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,966
- It'II only take a moment
- Yes of course

153
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,762
Ten minutes and then
I'm going, not a second Ionger!

154
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,209
Grace was conducted through the wretched
Iiving quarters bestowed upon the slaves

155
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,727
with their pitiful, Ieaky cabins

156
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,642
Her actions would comprise an unconditional
enrichment of these people's Iives

157
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,087
There was no doubt about that...

158
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,884
or was there?

159
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,609
Actually, Grace did not see so
much of the glow she had hoped for

160
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:34,644
The glow that could have convinced her that no
one would end up Iike the Iittle pale yellow canary

161
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:41,047
These were human beings but of the kind on
whom pain had been inflicted, Grace thought

162
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,967
as she was suddenly interrupted
by a strangely exotic accent

163
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:52,401
when we were slaves we were not
required to offer thanks for our supper

164
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,449
and for the water we
drank and the air we breathed

165
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,647
Nobody needs
to say thank-you, but...

166
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,086
But what?

167
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,569
You mean there's somethin'
we ought to be thankful for?

168
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,842
I didn't mean
"but" I meant "and"!

169
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,964
And, there's no reason to be grateful
for anything as natural as your freedom

170
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:27,326
I'm the first to apologize for everything you
and your people have been subjected to...

171
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,521
See, those gates should have
been unlocked seventy years ago

172
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,921
Only seventy years ago

173
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,402
but before that, of course,
they were completely justified?

174
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,846
No

175
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,402
no, no, you misunderstand me

176
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,284
what can I say?

177
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,681
You need to say nothing at alI

178
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,808
we've heard ofyour kind

179
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:58,727
A society Iady, who spends
her time rescuin' wretched nigras

180
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:10,321
I should Iike to say thank you! Missy
done give her time and effort to helpin' us

181
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,690
time I bet she could've spent
on all kinds of different things

182
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:22,208
'Cause, t'was perfectjustice when God
made some of us slaves and not others

183
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,046
A nigra is vile by nature

184
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,485
Oh, I know it ain't popular to say so!

185
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,162
And it ain't 'cause
of Burt that I say so

186
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,408
No, Victoria did not base her perception
exclusively on her experience of her husband

187
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,211
though God knows it weighed heavily

188
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,323
Burt was a useless eejit whose character
Victoria, regrettably so far in vain

189
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:55,089
had done her best to improve by hitting him
with any implement to hand on any given occasion

190
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,846
no matter how much he had
threatened to take his own Iife

191
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,322
by throwing himself
into Manderlay's deep welI

192
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,331
Grace Iooked at wilhelm the
old house slave and understood:

193
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,883
He had not brought her
here for anybody to thank her

194
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,604
he just wanted her to see them all!

195
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,403
The unfortunate flock that he very
rightly feared would have few chances

196
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,847
beyond the perimeter fence

197
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,130
Iiving proof of the devastating
power of oppression

198
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:35,847
Listen up, it's all been put on paper

199
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:42,129
we just needed to check the wordin' first,
bein' as these things are Iegal and bindin'!

200
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,645
Bingo!

201
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,764
what are these?

202
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,766
They're the contracts, Ma'am!

203
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:03,088
The family has been so
considerate to offer us all employment

204
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,087
Grace was not a Iawyer and unqualified to assess
the validity of the contract she held in her hand

205
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:18,371
But she feared that unfortunately any judge
in the county would deem it fair and proper

206
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,923
it appeared to Grace
that instead of "employee"

207
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,643
they mightjust as well have
retained the old term of "slave"

208
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:33,411
A body would only sign it if he or she
was utterly ignorant of Iife in a Iiberal society

209
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,531
or if he or she
really had no choice!

210
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,527
Folks, I suppose that you're
in urgent need of cash, Mark?

211
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,530
Cash?

212
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,966
I once knew this fella' from a Iittle
township nobody'd know the name of

213
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,841
so there ain't no grounds
to mention what t'was called

214
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,963
he had cash, not piles of it

215
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,365
we are prepared to Iend you some money
as covered by this other piece of paper

216
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,922
and we also can set up
a Iittle store here, ifyou Iike

217
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,890
after all, it's a Iong way to town

218
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:19,725
And ifyou buy enough for all of us,
I betcha Iiable to get a real nice bulk discount

219
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,446
and the goods'II be
cheaper than in town!

220
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,046
Ain't that right, Miss Grace?

221
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,322
I have no idea

222
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,489
PIease sign, everybody!

223
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,805
Sign here

224
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,649
All right, Iet's go!

225
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,844
- No, turn it off
- Damn it!

226
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,771
Daddy! You said that I didn't have
the power to help Tweety and you were right

227
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,768
I was a child then...

228
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,327
So, what is it this time?!

229
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,405
This time I have the power to act!

230
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,967
You said so back in Dogville

231
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,170
That your power would be mine, too!

232
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,807
And that I could use it in my own way!

233
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,324
That power was
to carry on the family firm

234
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:25,210
that I was open to new ideas

235
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:31,447
The power you ask for now will undoubtedly be
applied to something that's foolish at best and...

236
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,523
Daddy! You promised!

237
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:38,851
You were a bastard to mother, but when
you promised her something, she got it!

238
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,766
Ok, you've been
given what I promised you

239
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,843
Maybe things haven't
been split right down the middle

240
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,924
but this is as far as I am prepared to go!

241
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,401
I want nothing to do with your plans

242
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,651
And you won't be able to get in touch with
me if anything goes wrong and you need me

243
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,771
as usual, to get you out of trouble,
because fortunately, my dear

244
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:08,287
you'II have no idea where I am

245
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,843
- Daddy, I'd Iike to take Joseph, as well
- No

246
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,082
I need a Iawyer
to sort out some paperwork!

247
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,531
No, no, never, never

248
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,802
I'd never Iet Joseph go

249
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:31,410
He's the only man I know who can draw up a
contract so there's only one possible interpretation

250
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,166
and though I haven't
needed that talent as ofyet

251
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,527
I still might need it one day!

252
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,528
I'II give you Viggo and Bruno for him!

253
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,011
Never!

254
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,129
I've given you my best
associates and you know it!

255
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,120
Daddy! I was meant
to have been given half!

256
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,807
- If mother had been alive
- Oh, damn it, Grace!

257
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,042
So, that very day and into
the early hours Joseph employed

258
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,728
the celebrated unambiguous phrases
his previous employer and given him

259
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,168
so wretchedly Iittle
opportunity to practice

260
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:37,526
New contracts needed drawing
up and old ones needed nullifying

261
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,648
all with the astonishing goodwill
that parties always evince in the company

262
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,963
of rapid-firing machine pistols

263
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,406
These are the deeds of gift, you transfer the
property to the former slaves in joint ownership

264
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,281
The Iast document is your contract
of employment by this community

265
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:03,607
Employment? I don't quite
get what you mean by that...

266
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,767
It'II be without pay and the right
of termination is rather one-sidedly

267
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,446
in the hands of the
employer, but nevertheless

268
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:15,322
Manual Iabor... for you
and your family and Mr. Mays!

269
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,084
Hard Iabor

270
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,689
Say something, Bingo!

271
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:29,847
My father's back ain't so strong, he climbed
up to reach the chandelier, one Christmas day

272
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,771
And he fell off the
banister and struck a table

273
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,486
well, that's what happens
when you've got chandeliers

274
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:43,171
when I consider that your understanding
of the worth of other human beings

275
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,891
has reached the desirable stage

276
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,966
you and Mr. Mays and
your family will be allowed to go

277
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,291
Go? And Ieave our home?

278
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,521
Yes

279
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,605
and I assure you that even starting from
scratch your prospects will be a Iot better

280
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,286
than your former
Iabor's would have been!

281
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,210
with regards to the
presence of me and my men

282
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,528
we'II only act as your counselors

283
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,528
The guns are merely a precaution in
case of any threats to the new community

284
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:19,969
we intend to stay here, but
only until the first harvest is home

285
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,886
after which any of the new
shareholders who wishes to do so

286
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:27,487
may cash in his or her
deed of gift and receive a dividend

287
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,606
All right, will you
collect your deeds, Mark...?

288
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,449
Nobody was particularly enthusiastic or
confident about these Iate night Iegal formalities

289
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,811
But Grace could see beyond this

290
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,090
And if she saw Iittle else than
fear and disquiet in all these eyes

291
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:51,690
at Ieast she saw
gratitude in one single pair

292
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,970
namely in wilhelm's mild, old gaze

293
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:01,801
Burt! I got a deed of gift
here that ain't been accepted

294
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:05,851
will Mr. Burt approach forthwith
and take delivery of his deed of gift?

295
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,129
Mr. Burt? Mr. Burt?

296
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:14,241
Burt had actually prepared his
escape from his ferocious wife

297
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,171
Despite her Iack offaith in his abilities

298
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,927
Burt had succeeded in meeting
a woman through the fence

299
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,448
and she had agreed
to help him to abscond

300
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,369
and there he was waiting at
the agreed place at the agreed time

301
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,322
"A helping hand", the woman had said

302
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,962
what a peculiar coincidence that
two women should come to the aid

303
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,249
of the Manderlay
slaves at the same time:

304
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:50,204
Grace; and Burt's "helping hand"

305
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:54,121
and the similarities between
them were also peculiar:

306
00:25:54,280 --> 00:26:00,049
young; beautiful; white in male company

307
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,286
actually male
company in alarming numbers

308
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,250
where's the nigger?

309
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,610
Grace had moved into the freed
plantation: among its new shareholders

310
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,684
She was there as a guard, no more

311
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,288
But no one could stop her
from using this beautiful spring

312
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,001
to make her own Iittle observations
on the people of Manderlay

313
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,610
In the hope of spotting the burgeoning change
in character that freedom ought to bring

314
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,847
But unfortunately
she saw Iittle ofjust that:

315
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:50,370
She saw Victoria for the third time, Iooking down
the well in hope of a glimpse of the body of Burt

316
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,844
She saw FIora and EIizabeth
swooning for Timothy as ever

317
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,288
She saw the men spending
their time on card games

318
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,445
playing for tufts of blue
cotton under their Ieaking roof

319
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,842
And she saw how everybody would ignore
the eager Mark whenever he opened his mouth

320
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,370
not knowing that he was notorious for never
being able to give an intelligible answer to anything

321
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,525
we called him Putting head,
but his real name wasn't Putting head

322
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:28,611
Grace saw Victoria beating her
eldest son, for stealing a moldy cookie

323
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,721
And she saw the unstoppable,
irrevocable hierarchy of the beatings

324
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:38,602
Victoria beating Ed, Ed
beating Milton, and Milton, willie

325
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,290
who finally vented his frustration
further down the food chain on CIaire

326
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,843
who far too rarely managed to make
use of the window with the outside handle

327
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,369
that her Ioving father Jack had
installed as an emergency entrance

328
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:01,450
which also allowed her to fall asleep every
night to her favorite view of the twinkling stars

329
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,245
Every noontide Grace witnessed
with pity how the former slaves

330
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,722
were arrayed on the parade
ground with its mysterious numbers

331
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,486
and marks beneath Mam's balcony

332
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,723
as if nothing at Manderlay had changed

333
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,171
However, one of them did not submit
to this all-too-soothing power of habit

334
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,049
Timothy of course

335
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,286
In a flash his exotic pride
almost took Grace's breath away

336
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:37,049
This day Grace walked on past the old "Peach
House" where the whites were now detained

337
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,000
put to work on sundry more
or Iess needless Iittle repairs

338
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,642
on her way to the
barn housing her gangsters

339
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,645
So, how's everyone doing?

340
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,007
I'm afraid the men got nothing to do

341
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,162
And it's not so good for the moraI

342
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,563
In situations Iike that your father
always came up with something!

343
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,247
I bet he did! But it's
patience that's required

344
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,287
But not this much patience, Niels says,
Niels's grandpa was a cotton grower

345
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,330
And he says the cotton
should've been sown ages ago!

346
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,528
The soil doesn't Iook ready

347
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,809
Might be because nobody's ploughed it!

348
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,089
Maybe things are different here
from where your grandpa Iives?

349
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,766
No ma'am, don't reckon so

350
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:25,405
well, if it should've been sown, surely
the people here would be the first to know

351
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,601
As she did not want to impose

352
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:37,971
Grace's intercourse with the former slaves
had been Iimited to brief greetings and the Iike

353
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,488
But now it was time for
a talk with some meat to it

354
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,651
Excuse me, sir? Mark?
May I ask you something?

355
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,411
It's about planting the cotton

356
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:56,004
I've been around for sowin'
and harvestin' and birth and death

357
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,324
Right, so when should
the cotton be planted?

358
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,642
There're strict rules for that...

359
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,690
you can't mess
around with that sort of thing

360
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,687
Manderlay's always been renowned
for the precision of its harvest

361
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,526
the swallows always
migrate right afterwards

362
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,601
they settle here for the night
on their way across the marshes

363
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,489
But the planting?

364
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,201
It's a science, my dear Iady

365
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,321
And the weather, what you might've
expected, plays a fear-some role

366
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,927
Yes, yes, and when
will it be time this year?

367
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,165
Not too soon and not too Iate

368
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes, but when? Should the
cotton have already been planted?

369
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:49,849
I'm not the sorta fella' to pass on
information unless I'm damn sure of it

370
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,291
Iess the facts of the matter are
one hundred percent, in other words...

371
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,331
the facts need be beyond dispute

372
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,242
Do you know when to plant?

373
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,086
No

374
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,242
I'd better ask wilhelm,
is he in his cabin?

375
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,926
This morning he went
down to the bath house

376
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,802
he'd gotten a Iittle frayed around
the edges, as they say, it's a funny thing

377
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,850
I'm sorry... I'II go find him myself

378
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:27,924
Excuse me wilhelm,
I've come about the fields

379
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,090
The fields should've been ploughed
and harrowed three weeks ago

380
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,208
and the cotton planted two weeks ago

381
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,044
But does everybody know that?

382
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:44,287
Oh yes, but I reckon they thinkin' somebody
else oughta go out into the fields first

383
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,487
In the old days Overseer
Mays would've driven us out there

384
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,488
Maybe it's because
nobody really trust you, Missy

385
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,926
Yeah, but wilhelm, they could
be doing something else instead

386
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,686
repairs to their homes

387
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,765
they badly need it

388
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,810
The cabins have
always been a sore spot

389
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,965
But Mam said we ain't
got no material to fix 'em up

390
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,565
But we're going to need what we make on the
cotton, how else will people survive on their own?

391
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,801
Yeah

392
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,887
iffolks felt they
was given something

393
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,125
Something brought out
by this, these new times

394
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:37,327
That made their Iives better in
a convincing way, right here and now

395
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,967
I don't know what
that might be, but...

396
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,448
But we don't have time for that

397
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,762
we've been forced to sow Iate before

398
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,524
The harvest might be improved ifwe planted
it a bit Iate, even says that in Mam's Law

399
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,124
Mam's Law?

400
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,482
Oh, yes, Mam's Iaw

401
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,406
It's all the rules for running the plantation

402
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:05,361
But we weren't allowed to read it,
it was just for Mam and the family

403
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,048
Only for Mam and the
family, Grace thought...

404
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,642
Certainly no more...

405
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:39,403
And there on Mam's bed skimming through the old
book well filled with bizarre and vicious regulations

406
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,246
she came upon a page
that Iooked strangely familiar!

407
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,241
A table with numbers
from one to seven

408
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:51,724
Somewhere Grace had
seen something similar, for sure

409
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,291
Mam's Iaw revealed it alI

410
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:03,604
The Manderlay plantation
with its glamorous front mansion

411
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,766
and pitiful rear where the slaves had
their quarters had been kept in an iron grip

412
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,729
by these very numbers!

413
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:16,160
They represented the psychological
division of the Manderlay slaves

414
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,844
Sammy was a Group 5:
a CIownin' nigger

415
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:26,040
The formidable Victoria was of
course a Number Four: a Hittin' nigger

416
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,808
No wonder her husband Burt had found
it necessary to accept "a helping hand"

417
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,804
even if it was another color from his own

418
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,163
wilma and Mark were Losin' niggers

419
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,483
wilhelm was a Two: a Talkin' nigger

420
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,201
FIora was a weepin'
nigger, et cetera et cetera

421
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,921
there were pleasin' niggers
and crazy niggers by the dozen

422
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,648
The final category, Number One proudy niggers
consisted nowadays ofTimothy as expected

423
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,486
who was of course
not there, and EIizabeth?

424
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,645
No, it said seven, not one

425
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,001
she was a pleasin' nigger,
also known as a chameleon

426
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,282
A person of the kind who could transform herself
into exactly the type the beholder wanted to see

427
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,123
This was how the slave system had
been kept alive for so Iong at Manderlay

428
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,529
Bondage even through psychology!

429
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,889
As Grace in deep thoughts
gazed across the fields of Manderlay

430
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,362
she recalled another page in Mam's Iaw

431
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,522
dealing exclusively with the weeding of the
paths in the romantic "OId Lady's Garden"

432
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,765
The name of the narrow band
ofwoodland that skirted the plantation

433
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,968
"Trees and tree trunks!" Grace thought

434
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,324
So there were materials
at Manderlay after all!

435
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:19,090
Excuse me,
may I ask you all something?

436
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:29,441
Isn't it true that somebody
who's even poor and colored

437
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:33,683
can still take the trouble
to maintain their home?

438
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,809
How dare you?

439
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,484
Do you think colored folks prefer
holes in their roofs and wallowing in mud?

440
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,249
well then, all you need
to do is to mend those holes!

441
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:56,125
But I told you, there ain't never been the
materials for that kind of thing at Manderlay

442
00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:00,171
No materials? That's not true

443
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,407
when I'm in the fields
I see timber wherever I Iook

444
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,370
just waiting to be turned
into boards for a roof

445
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,047
or an extension or maybe
even a whole new cabin!

446
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:16,410
That be Mam's Garden,
you can't cut that down

447
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,610
And why can't we cut
down the OId Lady's Garden?

448
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,728
Have you really spent that many happy hours up
there on your knees weeding her romantic paths?

449
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,090
That's true, there's Ioads of timber

450
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,407
we ain't seen it as anything
but the OId Lady's Garden

451
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:43,247
I don't know what you think,
but to me it sounds Iike a splendid idea

452
00:37:54,840 --> 00:38:03,123
And at a stroke these seated, reclining, resting
people had turned into people going full tilt

453
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,768
walking, running, working people

454
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:11,164
without anyone having to threaten
them in the slightest with "The Lady's hand"

455
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,529
as Grace had been
told the great whip was called

456
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,730
And Grace had won a kind of victory

457
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:21,806
a small beginning of something
that would one day erase

458
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:26,090
all the negative inherited
behavior patterns at Manderlay

459
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,446
But, as Grace had suspected, the
appetite for improving the Iiving quarters

460
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,889
unfortunately exceeded
that for preparing the fields

461
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,769
But a few of the former
slaves had volunteered

462
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,970
And with the white
family and Grace herself

463
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:54,284
they made up a sort of gang
to prepare the soil for the seeds

464
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,483
Under the gaze of a demonstratively hostile
Timothy with his mysterious white handkerchief

465
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,490
He wasn't born here?

466
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,563
He's a Munsi

467
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,526
It's a Iine ofAfrican royalty,
it's a very proud Iine

468
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,169
He don't drink, either,
or gamble Iike the others be doing

469
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,971
with their Iittle blue
tufts of cotton money?

470
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
T'was Mam's Law

471
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,887
we weren't allowed no real money

472
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:38,364
Grace knew about the clever
system of currency in Mam's Law

473
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,964
Not real money you
could use in the outside world

474
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,681
The Munsi don't gamble
'cause don't believe in winnings

475
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:54,605
They believe you have to be humble to your
crops and only take what's absolutely necessary

476
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,364
I've never heard of these Munsi before,
but I do believe I once heard of the Mansi?

477
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:07,731
They different, they was
slaves ofAfrican kings, they gamble

478
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,449
they is true mischief, Timothy say

479
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,361
- So Timothy has prejudices as well?
- what?

480
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:19,565
Oh, nothing, I was just thinking aloud

481
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,088
Oh, so you've find company, FIora?

482
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,449
No, no, I was on my way out anyway

483
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,286
Timothy, Iet me tell you one thing

484
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:43,930
I know you don't Iike me and
don't trust me, and I can see why

485
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,247
Although our ideals differ,
you have a pride within you

486
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:53,450
that I believe will one day be
the salvation of everybody at Manderlay

487
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,487
Let me tell you one thing, too!

488
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,804
You got fine words, a posse of gangsters and
your white skin, somethin' folks here seem fall for

489
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,724
But I ain't fooled

490
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,968
You're not interested in us

491
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,848
Not as human beings

492
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,449
After all, it's tough telling people
apart when they're from another race

493
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,286
we whites have committed an
irreparable crime against an entire people

494
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,128
Manderlay is a moral
obligation because we made you!

495
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:35,407
Luckily, I'm just a nigger
who don't understand such words

496
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:41,081
and now, ifyou'II excuse me,
I've come here for the company of my girI

497
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,050
and that ain't nothing for you to see

498
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,882
black hides meetin'

499
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:52,763
and if I were you I'd Ieave
now before things get too nasty

500
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,281
Grace regarded Timothy's
hostility as a challenge

501
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,406
And the very next day she
took a step to dispel his claim

502
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:16,282
that as a white she was incapable
of caring for blacks as individuals

503
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:20,690
She had had a chat to Venus,
about her somewhat maladjusted son Jim

504
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:28,168
And Venus had revealed that Jim's behaviour
was merely that of a budding but frustrated artist

505
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,248
Tell me, have you seen Venus?

506
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,370
Nobody here wants your charity!

507
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,243
I have something for Jim!

508
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,768
I've had a really good Iook
at his face, since our Iittle chat

509
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:47,801
And you're right, it does
possess an artist's sensitivity

510
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,604
This is far too much

511
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,606
No, no, no, go on,
call him! This is for him

512
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,241
Jim, come on out here
with me and Miss Grace, baby

513
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:12,528
These are for you,
because we believe in you

514
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,282
Now run along,
and paint your fantastic pictures

515
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,446
and never mind those closed minded folks
who think they know what art is meant to Iook Iike

516
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,762
give them hell from me Jim!

517
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:33,245
Excuse me, but I ain't Jim,
I'm Jack, that's Jim!

518
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,960
It is tricky, as a matter offact I've
never been able to tell them apart either

519
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:52,047
They're both colored
and they both got curly hair

520
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,806
why Iook any deeper than that?

521
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:00,931
To be honest Grace had never been quite
sure which was Jim and which was Jack

522
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,722
A blunder that would, in her
former Iife among her fellow whites

523
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,929
merely have occasioned a Iittle Iaughter

524
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,168
in her Iife at Manderlay it was disastrous

525
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,162
But Iike her father, she did not take
Iong to transform a defeat into anger

526
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,891
energy and a counterattack

527
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,601
This is what has
created all this resistance

528
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,003
Even you regard it
as almost sacred, don't you?

529
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,762
I must admit it's played
a right important part of my Iife

530
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,284
And that will be my next move!
They should be allowed to see it

531
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,970
and to understand that it
can't do them any more harm

532
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:43,487
I wouldn't advise it, Missy

533
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:49,365
Presenting it to them would be Iike showing
a child the rod with which it's been beaten

534
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,286
I agree, it must be made public,
but we ain't all ripe for it

535
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:04,731
All right, then we shall have to
see about ripening you, and quickly!

536
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,009
And I'm not talking about the
couple of cozy meetings I've organized

537
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,446
to which hardly anybody turned up

538
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:14,083
I mean teaching with a timetable,
old fashioned hands on schooling

539
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:21,966
All right, I've got something for you to do at Iast,
and it even involves bossing people about...

540
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:27,251
At noon tomorrow I'm going to give my first
Iesson to all of the former slaves of Manderlay

541
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,244
And it'II be your job to
make sure that they're there

542
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:32,608
No excuse for not showing up!

543
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,171
And the family?

544
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,449
No, they're pretty
well teaching themselves

545
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,409
Are you Iistening to me?

546
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,206
It's 'cause Niels just got a great hand!

547
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:45,845
what?

548
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:53,170
who are you?

549
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,251
My name is Doctor Hector

550
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,810
Do excuse me a moment,
I'II have to pay my way out of this round

551
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,166
God knows, I don't believe you possess
any cards of real significance

552
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,165
You have a poker player's face

553
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,886
You see here my entire enterprise

554
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,320
I'd never gained access
to Manderlay before

555
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:27,280
so when I drove by today,
I saw the gates were open

556
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:30,001
I took it as a sign of new times

557
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,049
what exactly do you do?

558
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,081
I entertain, party games,
card games and the Iike

559
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,920
well, nowadays mainly the Iatter

560
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,929
You play for money?

561
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,607
Oh, but I do more than play

562
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,205
I cheat!

563
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:55,083
And you have no objections to
revealing this business secret ofyours?

564
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:58,130
Oh, to some people, but not to you

565
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:02,729
No, you see, ifyou and I establish
the business relationship I am anticipating

566
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:06,168
you'II be happen
to know exactly what to expect

567
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:08,049
And what can I expect?

568
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,685
Eighty per cent

569
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,567
Now, you certainly know
all the problems that arose

570
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,370
when our beloved new
deal was imposed in '65

571
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,082
the plantation owners had
plenty of Iand but nobody to work it

572
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,891
So they contracted
with their former slaves

573
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,602
But they just didn't have the same hold
on the rascals as they had in the old days

574
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,762
Of course, they Iend them money

575
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:39,804
Then quite a few of the nigras
actually saved up and paid off their debts

576
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,686
so the plantation owners got worried

577
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,009
- I bet they did!
- Oh, yes

578
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,521
See, that is where my idea came in

579
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,480
I went from plantation to plantation
with the full backing of the plantation owners

580
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,010
to entertain their employees, and they were
sorely in need of diversion, Iet me tell you

581
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,162
we just had a Iittle game of cards

582
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:06,530
And if anyone was
close to repaying his debt

583
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,730
I would take their shirt off their back!

584
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:16,967
And I'm prepared to offer you
that very same service today, Mam!

585
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,162
You are not convinced

586
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:29,528
Let me give you another
token of my profound Ioyalty

587
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:34,720
I have here a Ietter from
a man by the name of Stanley

588
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,161
He asked me to smuggle it out

589
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,603
I thought perhaps you would
Iike to see it before it is mailed

590
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,767
Listen, Mr. Hector, Iet me
just say that I've never met a man

591
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:55,611
whom I have instantly despised so wholeheartedly
both for his personality and his occupation

592
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,081
Does that mean you
are turning down my offer?

593
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:04,244
I never want to see you here again!

594
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:13,921
All right, well, I am disappointed

595
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:17,688
I shall nevertheless bestow
upon you my thought for the day

596
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,042
I indulge in word games

597
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:25,081
I Iike to give my clients something
to Iaugh or think about when I Ieave

598
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:33,170
The best technique for a card
sharp is "dealing from the bottom"

599
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:37,683
Look as ifyou're dealing
from the top of the deck

600
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:42,929
but instead you just take the
bottom card, one that you know

601
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,046
"Take from the bottom" means
something else entirely in social terms

602
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,410
but it is what I do,
I "take from the bottom"

603
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,007
won't be hard to find
me ifyou change your mind

604
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:12,846
The Ietter was aimed at a Mr. Miller, one of the
truckers who picked up cotton from Manderlay

605
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:20,521
and the plantation's only real contact with the
outside world, it was short and to the point

606
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:26,047
"we are being held prisoner by
gangsters and coloreds at Manderlay"

607
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,843
"inform the police and please
come to our aid with all due dispatch"

608
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:50,528
Indignation is a rare
emotion for a gangster

609
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:54,810
but a state ofjust that was what Grace's
men experienced while they herded

610
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,884
the colored people in
for their Iesson that day

611
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,728
as Grace had reported on Doctor Hector's
cheap trick of "taking from the bottom"

612
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:09,611
And it was hardly the sophisticated ambiguity
of the term that had affected them so dramatically

613
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,088
welcome to our Iesson

614
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:19,251
yes, I call it a Iesson as the term "meeting" seems
to have scared some people out of attending

615
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:23,610
I was coming, but I was Iate!

616
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:26,525
Very Iate, you hadn't made
it by the time we finished

617
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:30,526
In the old days we could hear
the bell from the old clock in the halI

618
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:34,606
T'was easier to keep up with time,
but we never hear it no more

619
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,321
Probably because nobody winds it up

620
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:42,204
But, now for the topic of
this Iesson: working together

621
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:49,249
Only four people from your
wing helped to prepare the fields

622
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:52,802
and only five helped to plant

623
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,606
I'm not a shareholder in this enterprise but if I
had been and if I had also been one of the five

624
00:51:57,760 --> 00:51:59,171
I would've felt cheated

625
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,965
Democracy means
government by the people

626
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,247
But as it's not practical
for everyone to sit in congress

627
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,530
a method by which people may
express their views is required

628
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,126
this method is called a ballot

629
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:20,729
All right, so Iet's try it out

630
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:25,847
we should choose a problem,
anything anyone can't decide on?

631
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:29,370
If I may suggest a small matter?

632
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,045
please do

633
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,924
I reckon the Iittle broken rake
is mine, but FIora reckons it's hers

634
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:43,167
That's an excellent suggestion,
it's a great example

635
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:48,691
I assume you all know of this dispute and
all feel able to have an opinion on it, right?

636
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:53,926
who does the community
think owns the rake?

637
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,562
It could turn out to belong
to both parties equally

638
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,130
now that would correspond
nicely with the subject of this Iesson!

639
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:04,966
working together,
sharing together, all right?

640
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:08,329
So, who thinks it's EIizabeth's rake?

641
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,525
Sammy?

642
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,729
I think it's EIisabeth's rake

643
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,211
All right!

644
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:24,161
SIowly the point of Grace's edifying
discourse dawned on the majority

645
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,044
Most of them thought the rake was
definitely EIizabeth's a few that it was FIora's

646
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:32,720
and nobody that it could be shared

647
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:41,163
I still remain undecided whether
the rake is EIizabeth's or FIora's

648
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:46,008
Right, so, not too surprisingly,
neither party receives Mark's vote!

649
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,484
From now on a Iittle broken
rake belongs to EIizabeth

650
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:53,962
That's what ballots are Iike,
there are winners and there are Iosers

651
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,407
But the community has spoken

652
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,601
And now Grace embarked on a
protracted explanation of FIora's difficulties

653
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,762
raking without a rake

654
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,686
and that owning things together
could have its advantages

655
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,967
To make sure that everyone
understood the democratic principle

656
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:15,806
the meeting carried out
another ballot at Jim's suggestion

657
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,888
I wanna talk about the fact that Sammy
being Iaughing so Ioud of his own jokes

658
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,371
and they ain't funny

659
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,560
and I been tryin' to get some sleep, and
I can't get no sleep, cause he Iaughs so Ioud

660
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,522
Maybe perhaps there can a be
a time when he can stop his joke

661
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,650
and stop Iaughing,
so we can get some sleep

662
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,890
You can't vote on a man's Iaughter,
you can't vote on a man's Iaughter surely

663
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,011
I'm hearing that it's
at sundown at sundown

664
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,164
That's what I'm hearing,
so Iet's do a vote

665
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,129
All right, so that's settled

666
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,404
That's democracy?

667
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,890
Finally wilhelm proposed that it would
be practical if somebody was responsible

668
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,170
for winding up the clock with
its small but penetrating chimes

669
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:15,163
And for mysterious reasons the probing
though fairly passive artist, Jim, was appointed

670
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,449
despite the song and
dance his mother kicked up

671
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,242
Grace wound up the Iesson by announcing
that the topic for the next day would be

672
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:28,126
"our anger and how to communicate it"

673
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,969
Maybe somebody would at
Ieast tell me what the time is?

674
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:37,123
Just ask Timothy,
he always know what time it is

675
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,726
he can tell by
the sun, he always do that

676
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:42,531
Or you can always
ask wilhelm, he's so old

677
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,160
He's from before
the clock ever got here

678
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:50,766
So wilhelm and Timothy, each made
his own suggestion as to what the time was

679
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,730
And they were astonishingly close

680
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,847
wilhelm thought it was eight minutes to,
Timothy thought it was five minutes to

681
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:05,645
and Grace rejoiced quietly at this natural
ability that they found so straightforward

682
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,043
But rapidly two factions emerged

683
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,680
one which insisted it was eight minutes to

684
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,447
and the other would not hear
of anything but five minutes to

685
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:21,240
And they were thus able to draw on
the day's Iearning and put it to the vote

686
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,081
The result was five
minutes to by a small majority

687
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:30,001
and so it was decided:

688
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:34,529
the official time at Manderlay
was five minutes to two

689
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,486
Grace's first Iesson of the day
took place in relative good humor

690
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,248
but the second one, the one that
had unfortunately proved unavoidable

691
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:51,085
was severer in character

692
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:57,165
Read!

693
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,250
Daily ration offood
for slaves from category 7

694
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:11,767
oh, no, 1 ... is, er...

695
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:18,087
Six ounces of solid food, and
they've always been given just that

696
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,448
no matter how Iittle
there was in the stores

697
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:26,323
That's a Iot Iess than
category seven, for example

698
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:35,047
why should a proudy "nigger" have
Iess to eat than an eye-pleasin' one?

699
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:42,806
How can the way your head seems to be
arranged have anything to do whatsoever

700
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,486
with the amount
people are given to eat?

701
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:52,171
I really don't know either,
not precisely, do you, Mr. Mays?

702
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,961
It could be just to
punish them for their pride!

703
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,124
No, I just did what it said

704
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,606
It mattered a Iot to my mother
that we follow these rules

705
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:10,807
I know of many places where everybody
got quite a bit Iess than 6 ounces

706
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,771
and where they began to eat dirt

707
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,970
It's a kind of custom coloreds
have when food is scarce 'round here

708
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,490
but it was forbidden under Mam's Law

709
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,688
That's not what we're discussing here

710
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,846
don't you see what an affront
it is to divide people up Iike that?

711
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,929
Folks is different

712
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,409
oxen and rabbits don't need
equal shares offodder neither

713
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,531
both parties would
come down with a belly ache!

714
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,366
Stop! All right, I'm not at all satisfied
with what I've heard here today

715
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,571
You're all speaking
up for this foolishness

716
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:55,050
I'm going to have to penalize you, because
so Iittle effort has been made in these Iessons

717
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,801
That evening Grace thought that her idea
of making the whites make up their faces

718
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:27,443
which had seemed so just and edifying
in her flash of anger that afternoon

719
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:31,600
was perhaps a tad too
much in the wrong direction

720
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,246
Even though Philomena herself in
her own childhood would not have dreamt

721
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,450
of going to the toilet without
the entertainment of her black nanny

722
00:59:42,600 --> 00:59:49,051
Look at your Uncle Jim, he's
in the bathtub Iearning how to swim

723
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,407
Can we clean our faces now?

724
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,847
Yes, yes, of course!

725
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:16,284
Ah well, here comes the dust

726
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,371
so none of this will matter any more

727
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:24,249
what do you mean?

728
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,565
There's gonna be a dust storm

729
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:32,006
and the plants have
only just begun to grow

730
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,202
it couldn't be worse!

731
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:41,802
But Manderlay's fields have
never been harmed by a dust storm

732
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,047
'Cause the
windbreak was still in place

733
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:54,082
Grace was not inclined to go into what the former
overseer meant by these mysterious words

734
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,040
And soon she had convinced herself
that they had no meaning at alI

735
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,921
apart from spreading
disquiet and despondency

736
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,921
The next day's Iesson on the
importance of unleashing one's anger

737
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:10,004
met Iittle understanding
from the assembly

738
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,284
It was when they wound
up with a series of ballots

739
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:20,241
and the community had rapidly
decided to use wilma's potatoes for seed

740
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,529
as she was so old and
did not have to eat that much

741
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:26,126
that they heard the wind

742
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,605
The dust had come at this time
for as Iong as anybody could remember

743
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,530
But every year from time immemorial
it had spared the newly planted cotton

744
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:53,527
as the plantation had been cleverly
shielded by a narrow band of trees

745
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,402
known in common parlance as
"The OId Lady's Garden"

746
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:11,287
In the midst of the almost Biblical
darkness that descended on Manderlay

747
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:16,367
Grace knew all to well that even
hand in hand with all the races of the world

748
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,683
no army of gangsters
could counter this

749
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,083
Nature's extravagant
demonstration of power

750
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:29,165
All she could do was watch
as row upon row of the seedlings

751
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:33,928
she had so welcomed disappeared
beneath the devastating dust

752
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:37,801
Nobody could do a thing

753
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,840
but apparently it did not
mean that no one would try

754
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:49,484
for now Grace
discerned a rider out there

755
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,291
He was riding Iike crazy

756
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:57,965
As he progressed across the fields, wherever
he spotted a pile of dust beginning to grow

757
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:01,249
he would break it
up with his horse's hooves

758
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:09,291
whether it would make the slightest dent
in the grand scale of things was hard to telI

759
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,010
but it was a battle

760
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:16,564
no matter how senseless
it might be: heroic and dangerous!

761
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:18,085
Timothy

762
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:26,045
Come back! Come back!
Timothy, Timothy!

763
01:03:26,200 --> 01:03:29,602
He's gonna be all right,
he knows these storms

764
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,641
Miss Grace, you's head over heels
for him, you's a fool, Miss Grace

765
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:11,210
- where did you find him?
- He was behind the house

766
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:29,926
Is he alive?

767
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:32,765
I do believe I know what
you mean by that question

768
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:34,763
But what does it mean to be alive?

769
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,809
I mean is he breathing?

770
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,724
Forget it

771
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,963
Is he dead?

772
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:49,403
we colored folks can be awfully
hard to kill ifwe want it that way

773
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:26,686
That very afternoon strong
Timothy was back on his feet

774
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,322
surveying the buildings
for damage caused by the storm

775
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:35,642
The dust had struck a devastating blow:

776
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:40,847
Unfortunately, hardest hit were the food
stores in the dilapidated "Peach House"

777
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,207
which had Iost its roof

778
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:46,887
Almost all of their
provisions were now inedible

779
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:52,009
On top of that the pneumonia
brought by the dust was inevitable

780
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:55,047
The dust had got in everywhere

781
01:05:55,320 --> 01:06:00,008
particularly where no new boards
could have provided weatherproofing

782
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:05,326
namely through the cracked glass in
the window on the stars above CIaire's bed

783
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:11,805
"Valuables", not to mention cash,
were non-existent at Manderlay

784
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:16,928
since the elegant clock miraculously
still ticking merrily away on the mantelpiece

785
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:19,401
turned out to be, not Swiss

786
01:06:19,560 --> 01:06:21,085
as Mam believed

787
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:25,285
but a copy made quite Iocally
and worth practically nothing

788
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:30,370
"The freed Enterprise
of Manderlay" was bust

789
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:38,047
wilhelm and Grace were therefore under no
illusions that anybody would attend class this day

790
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:45,447
But then, one by one the
Manderlay flock began to appear

791
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:56,762
I'm happy you're all here

792
01:07:00,520 --> 01:07:03,569
But I don't really have
a Iecture for you today

793
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,722
I'd just Iike to say

794
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:19,044
how badly I feel about
this hopeless situation

795
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:28,731
But of course words
aren't much use to you

796
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:33,201
No, Missy has
Iearnt that much at Ieast

797
01:07:36,080 --> 01:07:41,246
But as regards hopelessness,
it is something we do know a bit about

798
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:49,481
There are a million plants out there beneath
the dust, ifwe can save but fifty of 'em

799
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:54,806
perhaps we can grow a small quantity
of great quality and get a better price for it

800
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,920
I reckon we should make a move

801
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:11,165
And that is how the greatest disaster
turned into a stroke of Iuck for Grace

802
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:16,042
and how the people, with a common
foe, the dust, as their excuse

803
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:20,967
suddenly found themselves working shoulder
to shoulder with their deadliest enemy

804
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,887
to achieve the common goal
as free, grown-up Americans

805
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:29,408
Stanley and Bertie had
sown the fields with Iittle sticks

806
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:33,201
so that people could tell where
to uncover the tender seedlings

807
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,810
while FIora ever so
childishly kept teasing Grace

808
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,205
with her digs at Grace's supposed
romantic feelings towards Timothy

809
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,282
Good night, old wilma

810
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:57,003
Good night, child

811
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,450
we can Iie down and talk
for a while 'fore we go to sleep

812
01:09:01,600 --> 01:09:03,284
No, thank you, wilma

813
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,930
I'm not weary enough to go to bed yet

814
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:09,328
A Iittle walk helps

815
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,050
A walk when a body ain't
sleepy is a very good thing

816
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,560
I do the same myself

817
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,364
Good night!

818
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:23,445
Good night!

819
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:37,767
That everything seemed as moving along on
its own could be nothing but welcomed by Grace

820
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:43,684
But her Iack of an active part to play
had suddenly Ieft her in a kind of a vacuum

821
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:47,208
and allowed other things
inside her to claim attention

822
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:52,520
human things Iike
instincts and emotions

823
01:09:54,960 --> 01:10:00,000
An ominous sense of homelessness
and Ioneliness struck Grace this evening

824
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:08,127
As she wondered about, Grace suddenly found
herself outside the wooden rear of the bathhouse

825
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:19,569
without warning the homelessness transferred
into a strange desire to move up that rusty pipe

826
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:27,047
against the flow of dirty water into where
naked bodies were being washed in cheap soap

827
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:31,724
BIack skin

828
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,688
male and black manhood

829
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:50,327
what Grace had felt at the bath
house was undignified, shamefuI

830
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:54,805
Her mind was meant to be
devoted to policy at Manderlay

831
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:59,170
a matter in which these thoughts
had no business whatsoever

832
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,689
Grace had forced herself to sleep
to rid her thoughts of those black bodies

833
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:11,208
an achievement that was actually
possible thanks to the stubbornness

834
01:11:11,360 --> 01:11:13,362
that flourished in Grace's family

835
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:19,282
But the cotton seedling in her
Iove-starved body did not give up

836
01:11:19,720 --> 01:11:22,644
It manifested itself as a dream

837
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,406
Grace was in southern climes

838
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:33,571
There were women in exotic
costumes and men in turbans

839
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:40,964
Even in her sleep she hated with a passion
any idea of allowing that her father might be right

840
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:43,561
But it was a harem!

841
01:11:45,720 --> 01:11:51,921
A group of black slaves appeared,
bearing a huge charger piled with dates

842
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,642
And in a twinkling Grace Iay among
the dates, trembling with pleasure

843
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:02,045
as a flock of Bedouin satisfied
her one by one with their noses!

844
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:08,442
And it was even more confusing
when Timothy appeared

845
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:14,921
and was both the slave bearing wine,
hands shaking, and the Sheik himself

846
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:22,444
whose authoritative hands tested
the size of Grace's most intimate orifices

847
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:38,849
I must have overslept

848
01:12:39,480 --> 01:12:43,166
I'm sorry, CIaire
has had another turn!

849
01:12:53,520 --> 01:13:02,281
Yeah, she's running a bad fever
again, she had anything to eat?

850
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,920
Oh, sure, pork
chops and baked chicken

851
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,811
She's taken a Iittle oatmeal
but it's hard to get it into her

852
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:12,241
she had this trouble with her Iungs
Iast year when the dust come, too

853
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,166
but there was far more dust this year

854
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,048
Honestly Missy, you oughta go back
home to the clean air and Iarders full offood

855
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:26,565
we're all in this together,
no matter how hard it gets

856
01:13:26,720 --> 01:13:28,768
And hard it will get

857
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:35,370
I've seen what's Ieft around here though
some folks are still fillin' their bellies

858
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,044
You're right,
we've got to talk about that

859
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,531
Come on, it'II be all right, Rose!

860
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:57,927
I propose that we
ration what we have Ieft

861
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:03,850
and spread our provisions over a month until
we can harvest more from the vegetable gardens

862
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:10,084
And as I hear there are so
very few beans and potatoes Ieft

863
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:14,928
I think we should give them to
Rose who needs them for CIaire

864
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:20,569
what's Ieft will be shared
out equally among the rest of us!

865
01:14:23,680 --> 01:14:27,207
Excuse me, the rest of us?

866
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:30,889
- That goes for us too?
- Yes, of course it does

867
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,691
we've already eaten things
your father would ever have put up with

868
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:36,571
Joseph swears they couldn't
been described as food at alI

869
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:38,324
Iegally speakin'!

870
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:44,163
Your father used to Iet us obtain
stuffwhen the coffers were empty

871
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,641
Surely we could steal
something from somewhere

872
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:51,564
but I suppose that's
no good either, Miss Grace?

873
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,527
I'm afraid you're one tough cookie

874
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,649
Maybe I am

875
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,607
Sadly the most nourishing
fare the estate could still provide

876
01:15:19,760 --> 01:15:22,730
had not improved
CIaire's condition much

877
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,929
but she needed meat,
and Timothy knew it

878
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,769
and so henceforth they would have to do
without the Ioyal old donkey on the treadmilI

879
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:38,169
It was not a good portent of the Ievel
of morale that the gangsters were now

880
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,370
trying hard to fix the car
from the ravages of the dust

881
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:50,288
But Iuckily Joseph, a Iegal expert with the ability
to interpret the most incomprehensible of texts

882
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:55,202
had met his match in the
1923 Ford owner's manuaI

883
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:14,561
As time went by the scattered cotton
plants at Manderlay grew side by side

884
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:19,527
with its denizens' hunger now that
the Iittle that was Ieft of the donkey meat

885
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,047
was reserved for CIaire

886
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,208
And Grace found herself in the
peculiar situation ofjoining wilma

887
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,082
and the other women in what had been
completely forbidden under Mam's Iaw

888
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,286
namely the southern
tradition of eating dirt

889
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:44,410
Having given up on the automobile manuals
Joseph had found a quaint turn of phrase

890
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:47,291
in the agreement into
which he had originally entered

891
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:50,523
with Grace's father
regarding his employment

892
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,762
The wording could with a Iittle good will be
interpreted to mean that certain circumstances

893
01:16:56,920 --> 01:17:01,767
obliged an employee to obey
a higher authority than his boss

894
01:17:02,280 --> 01:17:05,648
the authority in this
case being his stomach

895
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:18,606
The good news was that although the
drought had been hard on the fields

896
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:22,810
Stanley and Timothy had invented
a weapon to deploy against it

897
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:29,290
wait, wait, it's coming, it's coming

898
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:52,211
But the best news of all was CIaire

899
01:17:52,360 --> 01:17:58,049
who had miraculously gained so much strength
that she could empty her plate of good food

900
01:17:59,160 --> 01:18:05,805
always in the middle of the night when everyone
was asleep and nobody was Iooking, but even so

901
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:17,965
If Grace had thought hunger would
put paid to her forbidden sensual fantasies

902
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:21,010
actually the opposite
was more the case!

903
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,731
FIora, what's goin' on with the chickens?

904
01:19:00,080 --> 01:19:01,684
Are they fighting?

905
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:04,491
You mean the four
whites after the black?

906
01:19:04,960 --> 01:19:07,440
You want I should open
the door and have a peek?

907
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,045
No

908
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:13,770
Mind you, that Iittle black hen real proud

909
01:19:14,360 --> 01:19:18,331
wouldn't surprise me if them others
took the chance to give her the odd peck

910
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:23,726
Now don't you tease me, FIora

911
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:26,849
Goodnight then

912
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,769
Goodnight

913
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:35,571
FIora had teased Grace
before with the Iittle black hen

914
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,686
But they were hurting
it in there! No doubt about it!

915
01:19:41,600 --> 01:19:45,969
And to make everything
far worse, that heat in her Ioins

916
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:50,808
seemed to come back in spite of
that poor chicken's cry for help

917
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,045
Or even intensified by it?

918
01:19:58,520 --> 01:20:05,051
Devastated, humiliated and overcome
by fear for her sanity, she fled

919
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,931
And in a fit of madness

920
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,881
or what others would simply call "horniness"
she threw herself onto her bed on her tummy

921
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:16,840
and for a moment forgot all about
shame and political correctness

922
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:19,401
and did what she had
not done since her childhood

923
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:23,167
when she had not yet
known it was so infinitely wrong:

924
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:29,601
she pressed herself onto the knot she had rapidly
and instinctively formed by bunching her quilt

925
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:38,965
whether it was pleasurable
or painful is hard to telI

926
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:42,727
but she kept at it,
it was beyond her controI

927
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:48,000
with no regard for the sleep of the women
around her or common decency in generaI

928
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:53,166
the pulsating explosions in her
nether regions took over her world

929
01:20:57,680 --> 01:21:02,641
And who knows how it would have concluded
had there not appeared at that very moment

930
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:04,564
fortunately for Grace

931
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:09,362
a person shaking her back to
a reasonable state of self defense

932
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,965
Miss Grace! You gotta
come quick, Miss Grace

933
01:21:11,120 --> 01:21:12,451
what?

934
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:31,810
She's dead

935
01:21:38,120 --> 01:21:40,930
I took such care of her

936
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,086
I fed her the good meat

937
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:53,362
But she'd been eatin'

938
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,604
she's dead! Dead

939
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,403
But she'd been eatin'

940
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:29,202
No! She hadn't
been eatin', this 'un had!

941
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,887
Are ya gonna tell 'em, wilma?

942
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:43,728
I was so hungry, I get so dizzy

943
01:22:49,160 --> 01:22:51,686
and my Iegs hurt when I'm hungry

944
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:58,371
Our good friend and CIaire's beloved OId wilma
been visiting in the window so while we slept

945
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:01,889
She emptied CIaire's
plate every single night

946
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:07,285
T'was as easy as pie, considerin' that there
window could be opened from the outside

947
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:15,689
I've eaten so much dirt in my time,
my teeth can't take it no more

948
01:23:18,720 --> 01:23:21,007
She killed our Iittle girI

949
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,882
Jack, she was sick

950
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,646
- Miss Grace
- She was sick, Jack

951
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:33,803
Rose didn't worry to much about feeding her
during the day, 'cause she ate so much at night

952
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:36,531
I want wilma punished
for killin' my Iittle girI

953
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,446
I want this matter put to the vote

954
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:49,687
I want wilma punished for killin' my Iittle girl,
I wantjustice or I'II kill her myself, right now

955
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:52,042
Let me go

956
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:06,923
Stop it, Jack!

957
01:24:07,480 --> 01:24:11,041
- Stop we'II talk about it tomorrow...!
- She killed my Iittle girl!

958
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:12,406
Stop it

959
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:28,041
And so, the very next evening a
gathering took place under the magnificent

960
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:32,922
clear, twinkling,
starry sky of Manderlay

961
01:25:48,680 --> 01:25:50,603
Now we've heard 'em all, wilhelm

962
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:57,281
wilma showed no mercy to our CIaire so no
mercy oughta be shown to her, she must die!

963
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:03,962
Jack, killing OId wilma
won't bring CIaire back

964
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:09,843
All we want is justice, you've said
so many times, that we're entitled to it!

965
01:26:14,440 --> 01:26:22,291
I propose that she
be banished from Manderlay

966
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,125
for stealing food in an emergency

967
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,811
she probably won't survive
that anyway, as old as she is

968
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:40,844
after all, we don't know if the matter of the
food made any difference at all in CIaire's fate

969
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:43,765
wilma can't have
known whether it would kill her

970
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:51,526
but she didn't care a bit when it came to
riskin' somebody else's Iife that of our Iittle girl!

971
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:57,928
All wilma saw was a plate nobody
was touching, she was hungry

972
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,487
And what do you
think the rest of us was?

973
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,328
All of us here ate what we had agreed?

974
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,320
And whatcha think Iittle CIaire was?

975
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:14,964
we're all hungry, and that
just makes it far, far worse!

976
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:31,808
All right, I'd Iike to ask y'all to
vote on Jack and Rose's motion

977
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:40,928
All those who believe that wilma
deserves to die, raise your hands!

978
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:01,127
Thank you, thank y'alI

979
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,485
Stop!

980
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:14,605
Grace, I thought we were the
ones who made the decisions here

981
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,641
that's what you've always told us?
Or maybe it's only sometimes?

982
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:22,330
No, of course not, it's always

983
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:25,643
And they's the decisions
you're here to defend, ain't they?

984
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,690
So Iet me go across and do it!

985
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,171
No

986
01:28:42,160 --> 01:28:45,289
if anybody is going
to do it, it's going to be me

987
01:28:49,280 --> 01:28:51,965
it must not be an act of vengeance

988
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,968
That's all right by me

989
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:59,969
as Iong as she
suffers as much as CIaire

990
01:29:00,120 --> 01:29:02,407
That will be up to me

991
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,321
I'II Iet you know when it's over

992
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:51,964
Grace

993
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,451
be so kind as to tell me

994
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:04,002
what did they decide?

995
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,249
Am I gonna die?

996
01:30:24,320 --> 01:30:26,687
No, wilma, you're not going to die

997
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,403
whatcha mean?

998
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:39,560
I mean the ballot did not go
Jack's way, you're not gonna die!

999
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:50,125
See, they didn't think that CIaire
would've eaten the food on her plate anyway

1000
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:58,802
and anyhow she'd certainly
have died from pneumonia from the dust

1001
01:31:00,240 --> 01:31:02,481
Did they really say that?

1002
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,602
Yes, they really said that

1003
01:31:18,240 --> 01:31:23,724
Ifyou knew
how terrible the waitin' was...

1004
01:31:30,280 --> 01:31:32,647
I'm just so weary

1005
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:41,527
I know, I know you are,
but now you can sleep easy

1006
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:49,249
Yes, I can

1007
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:52,886
Lie down and get some sleep

1008
01:31:58,200 --> 01:32:01,761
You are the daughter I might had

1009
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:14,605
Lie down

1010
01:32:14,760 --> 01:32:17,525
will you stay 'till I sleep?

1011
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:19,205
I'II do that, wilma

1012
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:23,051
Here

1013
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:29,810
Lie down

1014
01:32:46,000 --> 01:32:47,764
wilma?

1015
01:34:30,960 --> 01:34:36,205
Harvest-time finally did arrive and
the cotton went safe into the sacks

1016
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,720
Despite the fewer bushes
the harvest was splendid

1017
01:34:42,240 --> 01:34:46,609
It was as if all the trials and tribulations
had made the cotton extra white

1018
01:34:46,760 --> 01:34:54,611
and the fibers extra strong, and even at
current prices it would bring in a record sum

1019
01:34:57,160 --> 01:34:59,811
And although nothing
was the way it had ever been

1020
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:03,487
the harvest was as precise
as always at Manderlay

1021
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:09,331
The moment the Iast tuft of cotton
was in the sack, the swallows arrived

1022
01:35:09,480 --> 01:35:12,643
dropping from the
skies towards the marshes

1023
01:35:13,480 --> 01:35:19,487
Everyone observed the sight in awe and for
a moment it was greater than all the words

1024
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:21,847
and politics in the world

1025
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:36,884
The old gin was as ready as ever, it had
been for a week, greased and stripped down

1026
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:41,329
and reassembled by Sammy,
who had teamed up with Niels

1027
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:46,851
They worked well in harness, Niels
had never found a joke funny in his Iife

1028
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:52,928
so Sammy, the clownin' nigger, had given
up, not unrelieved, trying to entertain him

1029
01:35:53,080 --> 01:35:56,243
with his somewhat weak materiaI

1030
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:09,481
Miss Grace? Miss Grace?

1031
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:18,489
Edward?! God, I hardly recognized you!
You've certainly changed the way you dress!

1032
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:25,131
Yes, your father thought it was time for a change,
he's on his way into a new area of business

1033
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:27,922
- Is daddy here?
- No, he just sent me on ahead

1034
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,923
to give you a message

1035
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:37,125
Your father says he will be by a week
Monday at eight o'clock in the evening

1036
01:36:37,440 --> 01:36:41,126
He told me to tell you that he will wait in the
car outside the gates for a quarter of an hour

1037
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:45,285
and not a second Ionger,
the way he did in Dogville, he says

1038
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:48,365
and the way he did with
your mother, I think it was...

1039
01:36:48,600 --> 01:36:52,366
- when he asked her to marry him
- Yes, something Iike that

1040
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:56,081
But ifyou want to go with him, you better
be there, 'cause he says he'II just push on

1041
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,123
I know, I get the message

1042
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,726
All right, I'm on my way,
take care, Miss Grace!

1043
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:02,291
You too, Edward

1044
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:12,205
Edward! just tell dad
that new times have come to Manderlay

1045
01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:19,051
But no, Grace had no intention of
going with her father when he arrived

1046
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:25,560
she had her own Iife to Iead now and it suited
her just fine, but she'd be at the gates anyhow

1047
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:32,444
She just had to show him what she had
achieved, a new and better Manderlay

1048
01:37:36,600 --> 01:37:40,047
It was examination day
for Stanley and the family

1049
01:37:40,360 --> 01:37:43,682
because even though things
had been going well recently

1050
01:37:43,840 --> 01:37:47,208
when Stanley partook of his
traditional beer with Mr. Miller

1051
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:51,570
nobody would be able to prevent him from
revealing what had happened on the plantation

1052
01:37:51,720 --> 01:37:54,166
and thereby ruin it alI

1053
01:37:54,480 --> 01:37:59,611
wilhelm had been highly skeptical about
Ietting the whites talk to the drivers at alI

1054
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:03,685
but Grace had insisted,
she trusted them

1055
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:16,208
Eejit nigger! Are you totally useless?

1056
01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:19,488
Sorry, Mr. Mays!

1057
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,730
I'm joking

1058
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:35,327
Stanley Mays and the family passed

1059
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,362
That very evening Grace
pronounced them graduate Americans

1060
01:38:42,400 --> 01:38:46,200
And although they were free
to go they had elected to stay

1061
01:38:46,360 --> 01:38:51,571
as there was talk of hiring the family
and Stanley Mays on a permanent basis

1062
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:57,651
And before anybody knew it the days
had passed and the money was in the bank

1063
01:38:57,800 --> 01:39:02,124
from where it had been picked
up by proud Timothy on horseback

1064
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:09,286
Niels and Sammy had fixed the car,
wisely without reference to the manuaI

1065
01:39:09,960 --> 01:39:12,361
- Thank you, for everything
- Thank you

1066
01:39:13,320 --> 01:39:17,120
- what are you gonna do now?
- I don't know

1067
01:39:17,760 --> 01:39:20,047
You could always
go back to gangstering

1068
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,249
where is Mr. Robinsson?

1069
01:39:25,400 --> 01:39:28,085
He's been down
the cabins shakin' hands

1070
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:34,644
Grace was touched by Mr. Robinson's
sudden social interest in the former slaves

1071
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:41,491
But it felt right when the car Ieft, it was
time for Grace to say goodbye to power

1072
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:48,721
Brave and strong thy men and women

1073
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:57,083
Better this than corn
and wine, make us worthy God in heaven

1074
01:39:57,640 --> 01:40:02,726
of this goodly Iand ofThine

1075
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:09,287
Hearts as open as our doorway

1076
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:15,920
Liberal hands and spirits free

1077
01:40:16,720 --> 01:40:23,171
Alabama, Alabama

1078
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:30,721
we will aye be true to thee

1079
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,243
He's watching you

1080
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:54,080
- No, he's not!
- He's watching you

1081
01:40:54,960 --> 01:40:56,041
No he's not!

1082
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:59,244
I reckon it have somethin'
to do with them gangsters Ieavin'

1083
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:05,966
See, honey, when you was boss,
he has visitin' your kingdom

1084
01:41:06,760 --> 01:41:09,445
Now, you're visitin' his

1085
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:12,525
I reckon he wants you now

1086
01:41:13,200 --> 01:41:15,931
He should have some dinner,
I'm gonna go get him

1087
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,208
You gotta come
and get some dinner

1088
01:41:23,520 --> 01:41:25,488
Quiet, woman!

1089
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:56,883
In Mam's bedroom Grace recalled
FIora's worrying, intimate Iittle details

1090
01:41:57,040 --> 01:42:02,046
Sexual intercourse amongst the Munsi
was determined by ancient traditions

1091
01:42:02,640 --> 01:42:05,803
It would not appeal
to Grace, FIora had said

1092
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:11,046
not with Grace's modern ideas
of equality of people and the sexes

1093
01:42:15,640 --> 01:42:20,521
but Grace seemed to have Ieft
her progressive attitudes at the table

1094
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:38,120
Now actually in the situation she had
dreamed of... it was all more bizarre than erotic

1095
01:42:38,360 --> 01:42:42,206
anyway Grace decided
to hang on to this opinion

1096
01:44:08,520 --> 01:44:10,284
Timothy, wake up!

1097
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,607
Timothy's horse had got out of
the staple when fires had been Iit

1098
01:44:16,760 --> 01:44:20,970
around the Manderlay slave
quarters while Grace was asleep

1099
01:44:34,640 --> 01:44:36,130
what happened?

1100
01:44:36,280 --> 01:44:41,286
I can't tell you, ifyou want a clear answer
you gonna have to ask somebody else

1101
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:44,563
- The gangsters took the money!
- what?!

1102
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:52,089
The gangsters took the money! That's the answer!
And I reckon it's a pretty clear answer, too!

1103
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:57,644
It certainly is very clear,
but what makes you think so?

1104
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:09,326
when the party ended we all Ieft the
table to go and take a Iook at the money

1105
01:45:11,000 --> 01:45:14,561
Timothy had hid it behind the red slope

1106
01:45:15,600 --> 01:45:21,243
Timothy was meant to be keepin'
an eye on the place, but he wasn't there

1107
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:25,447
And the box had been
pulled up, it was empty

1108
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:34,248
One of the gangsters dug up the money
when he was pretendin' to say goodbye

1109
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,528
But he couldn't have done it alone

1110
01:45:36,680 --> 01:45:40,571
Someone must've
told 'em where the box was

1111
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:47,006
And Sammy refused to admit it was him

1112
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:51,602
although he'd spent
a whole Ioad of time with Niels

1113
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:56,722
And then everybody
started yellin' and screamin'

1114
01:45:56,880 --> 01:46:03,081
and folks is angry and no one's Iistenin'

1115
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:07,803
Stanley Mays and
the family got away I believe

1116
01:46:08,480 --> 01:46:12,644
although Philomena
and Bertie got cut up real bad

1117
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:19,690
EIizabeth is dead too,
although that was mostly by accident

1118
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:27,811
It was too soon to send the guns
away, we weren't quite ready yet

1119
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:33,163
For once Grace had nothing to say

1120
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:38,208
She could but reproach herself in silence
for her tasteless joke to the gangsters

1121
01:46:38,440 --> 01:46:42,968
about resorting to their former
occupations if things got tight

1122
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,162
wilhelm, I can't rouse Timothy

1123
01:46:45,320 --> 01:46:47,607
No, I bet you can't

1124
01:46:48,440 --> 01:46:51,887
he drank three bottles
of hooch before we ate

1125
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,762
The Munsi don't drink!

1126
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:04,446
Oh, well, maybe they
do on special occasions

1127
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:17,601
well! It certainly
is Iively 'round here!

1128
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:24,243
Didn't I tell you I didn't
want to see you here again?

1129
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:30,805
Yes, but I haven't come to do
a deal, I have come to conclude one

1130
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,967
and in the hope of course that
you'II see that I am an honest man

1131
01:47:36,120 --> 01:47:38,964
Cause, I needn't have
come back to settle up at alI

1132
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:49,248
This is your 80 per cent, quite
amounts to a tidy bit too, as you can see

1133
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:53,242
It's the money from our harvest?

1134
01:47:53,400 --> 01:47:57,200
I expect so, it's that time ofyear

1135
01:47:58,840 --> 01:48:04,722
See, I had a Iittle game with a young man who
came to see me and I knew he come from here

1136
01:48:04,880 --> 01:48:08,601
so I've made my humble return

1137
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:12,890
Don't you think that you've
just might have been wrong about me?

1138
01:48:13,720 --> 01:48:16,530
who did you play for all this money?

1139
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,729
It was a day ago now

1140
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:27,002
See, I would have come sooner but I pass
this black car with some gentlemen in dark coats

1141
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:31,529
they began to follow me, shouting
the whole time, that I was going to die

1142
01:48:31,720 --> 01:48:38,569
and that I was a con man who dealt
from the bottom, what an accusation!

1143
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:42,008
well itjust took me a while
to get away from them

1144
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:43,764
who was it?

1145
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:48,171
The Nigra fellow and he arrived
on horseback, what was his name?

1146
01:48:48,760 --> 01:48:50,285
Timothy?

1147
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:56,887
Yeah, that was it, Timothy,
yeah, that was his name

1148
01:48:57,040 --> 01:49:00,931
He's a Munsi! They don't gamble!

1149
01:49:01,480 --> 01:49:06,566
well, I know, Munsi don't gamble,
I'm a bit of an expert in this field

1150
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:09,644
You'II have a devil time
gettin' them to the gamin' table!

1151
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:16,050
but he's no Munsi, in fact he's what
I'd call a splendid fella at the card table

1152
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:21,161
and he just stayed bein' splendid
no matter how much he Iost

1153
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:24,646
But he told everyone he was a Munsi

1154
01:49:24,800 --> 01:49:29,601
Of course, see, the girls were
wild about the tales that he told

1155
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:36,211
All the Munsi tales, the proud African,
the royal Iine, all that old-fashioned morality

1156
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:43,642
and the accent of course, and on
account of that the girls was easy to bed

1157
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:50,850
There! I'm not even going
to avail myself ofyour gratitude

1158
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:54,329
That's just the kinda'
fella I am, hey ho!

1159
01:49:57,320 --> 01:50:01,120
BIess me if I can't come
up with a motto for today

1160
01:50:03,000 --> 01:50:08,245
they say the Mansi are
better hung than the Munsi

1161
01:50:08,920 --> 01:50:15,883
or "The Munsi are so up-stuck
but the Mansi, how they fuck!"

1162
01:50:21,120 --> 01:50:24,010
well then, I'II be seein' you!

1163
01:50:24,360 --> 01:50:27,842
we can talk business another day

1164
01:50:51,960 --> 01:50:55,646
Grace went straight to the Iast pages
with the tables of personal details

1165
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:57,848
on the slaves at Manderlay

1166
01:50:58,360 --> 01:51:03,764
where was Timothy, now?
Yes, his name had a 1 beside it

1167
01:51:04,000 --> 01:51:09,928
A proudy slave,
as she'd read earlier or did it?

1168
01:51:12,080 --> 01:51:15,289
She Iooked more closely
at the handwritten number

1169
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:19,600
She compared it to the
seven next to EIizabeth's name

1170
01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:22,480
The pleasin' nigger
of the chameleon type

1171
01:51:22,640 --> 01:51:26,281
an expert in changing character
according to whatever was opportune

1172
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:33,483
and what would titillate and enthrall the
other person, and then Grace could see it

1173
01:51:33,640 --> 01:51:37,201
Timothy's number
was not a one but a seven

1174
01:51:37,360 --> 01:51:40,364
She had only wanted to read it as a one

1175
01:51:40,960 --> 01:51:48,686
There was even a note beside Timothy's
name: "Caution, diabolically clever"

1176
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:16,487
Grace had called a final meeting
for everybody at Manderlay

1177
01:52:16,920 --> 01:52:23,929
for that evening she had decided to Ieave the
place forever with her father when he arrived

1178
01:52:24,080 --> 01:52:26,003
Oh, you're all here

1179
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:33,006
I persuaded the community to
assemble, extraordinarily, for two ballots

1180
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:37,051
whatever they involved, they can scarcely
have anything to do with me any more

1181
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:39,527
Don't be too certain of that, Miss Grace

1182
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:45,084
well, I am certain,
I've come to say goodbye!

1183
01:52:48,080 --> 01:52:49,923
And ifyou've had two ballots today

1184
01:52:50,080 --> 01:52:54,449
well, oddly enough that coincides
with the two presents I have brought

1185
01:52:54,680 --> 01:53:01,290
farewell presents,
ifyou Iike, the first is this...

1186
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:08,123
It's the money from our harvest

1187
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:14,728
well, actually it's 80 percent of it, a cardsharp
kept the other 20 per cent as commission

1188
01:53:15,120 --> 01:53:20,524
He scammed the money off of somebody
from Manderlay in a game of cards

1189
01:53:21,040 --> 01:53:22,883
So the gangsters didn't take it?

1190
01:53:23,040 --> 01:53:29,810
No, no they didn't
and I won't prolong the tension

1191
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,725
it was the treasurer who did it

1192
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,730
the man charged with
Iooking after the money

1193
01:53:37,560 --> 01:53:45,889
He was overcome by his eagerness to play,
probably because he isn't a Munsi at alI

1194
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:52,848
but a Mansi, however
unimportant that may sound

1195
01:53:54,840 --> 01:54:03,248
which brings me to my second present, this
one, painful to you or not, it has to come out

1196
01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:12,763
In this book, which I still regard as the most
abominable, contemptible document ever written

1197
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:15,571
Timothy is Iisted as a pleasin' nigger

1198
01:54:15,840 --> 01:54:20,368
a person who can change his appearance
to please the beholder, as he has done

1199
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,209
Iet me find the page

1200
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:28,370
It's on page 104!

1201
01:54:33,160 --> 01:54:36,846
How do you know? I thought
no slave had ever seen this book

1202
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:40,482
How do you know what's
on page 104 of Mam's Law?

1203
01:54:41,560 --> 01:54:43,483
'Cause I wrote it!

1204
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:01,529
It's all in my meticulous hand

1205
01:55:03,720 --> 01:55:07,406
Mam and I were very young
when the war suddenly ended

1206
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:11,526
and this new statute terrified us

1207
01:55:12,400 --> 01:55:14,004
Terrified you?

1208
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:20,926
we tried to imagine what kind
ofworld were these slaves Iet out into

1209
01:55:21,080 --> 01:55:23,162
were they ready for it?

1210
01:55:24,320 --> 01:55:29,565
Or more correctly,
was it ready for them?

1211
01:55:29,880 --> 01:55:33,521
The Iegislators promised all kinds
of things but we didn't believe 'em

1212
01:55:33,840 --> 01:55:41,042
And that was then Mam urged me to
commit to paper the way I thought things

1213
01:55:41,200 --> 01:55:46,161
should be done here if everyone
stayed on at Manderlay

1214
01:55:47,640 --> 01:55:50,405
But it's the prolongation of slavery

1215
01:55:51,480 --> 01:55:56,247
You might call it that, you might
also call it the Iesser of two evils

1216
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:02,720
But did the others know
that you wrote this book?

1217
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:08,125
Groups 2, 3 and 5, always knew

1218
01:56:08,800 --> 01:56:13,488
A few members of the other
groups were better off not knowing

1219
01:56:13,640 --> 01:56:21,525
But everyone knows now, I wrote
Mam's Law for the good of everyone!

1220
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,086
For the good of everyone!

1221
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:32,371
For the good of everyone?

1222
01:56:34,600 --> 01:56:36,682
How dare you?

1223
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:42,043
It's a recipe for oppression

1224
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:48,171
and humiliation from start to finish

1225
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:54,207
I think you've been reading it through
the wrong spectacles, Miss Grace

1226
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,490
if I may take the Iiberty of saying so

1227
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:05,891
And then wilhelm initiated Grace into the
humane qualities, of the Iesser of two evils

1228
01:57:06,680 --> 01:57:10,810
Mam's Iaw! How it
guaranteed food and shelter

1229
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:14,442
and allowed anybody the privilege
of complaining about their masters

1230
01:57:14,600 --> 01:57:17,570
instead of having to blame
themselves for the Iife of no hope

1231
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:21,566
that they would
surely have to Iead in the outside world?

1232
01:57:21,960 --> 01:57:26,409
How the noonday parade was a blessing
since the parade ground was the only place

1233
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:29,245
with shade at the warmest time of day?

1234
01:57:29,480 --> 01:57:33,326
How the numbered groups were determined
according to the patterns of behavior

1235
01:57:33,480 --> 01:57:38,691
that human beings resort to in order
to survive in an oppressive community?

1236
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:44,603
so that Iife could be made easier for
each of them, since a proudy' nigger

1237
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:52,042
not that Manderlay had seen many, if any, of
these, survives by perceiving himself as proud

1238
01:57:52,200 --> 01:57:56,285
and could be helped by this system to
believe that he was a bit more persecuted

1239
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:58,727
and punished than the others

1240
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,927
Since a CIowning nigger would
benefit greatly from the Iaughter

1241
01:58:03,080 --> 01:58:06,482
that Mam's Law strictly
demanded of its master

1242
01:58:06,640 --> 01:58:10,929
just as any other groups
benefited from similar obligations

1243
01:58:11,080 --> 01:58:15,085
How cash was forbidden so that
gambling had to be done with cotton money

1244
01:58:15,240 --> 01:58:21,088
to prevent ruination and
misery for the families, etc. etc.

1245
01:58:21,320 --> 01:58:24,847
Until Graces head
felt fair ready to explode

1246
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:29,324
Damn it, wilhelm, they're
not free! That's what matters!

1247
01:58:29,480 --> 01:58:37,809
I'd call that a philosophical argument, which
neatly brings me to the two ballots I just mentioned

1248
01:58:38,240 --> 01:58:41,244
was Mam's Law still relevant?

1249
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:47,606
And we agreed that unfortunately
it was as relevant now as it ever was...

1250
01:58:48,480 --> 01:58:54,601
America was not ready to welcome us
Negroes as equals seventy years ago

1251
01:58:54,760 --> 01:59:00,449
and it still ain't, and the way things are
goin' it won't be in a hundred years from now!

1252
01:59:00,600 --> 01:59:09,770
So we agreed we'd Iike to take one step
backwards at Manderlay and reimpose the old Iaw!

1253
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:12,602
Excuse me, but I'm going

1254
01:59:12,880 --> 01:59:18,125
As for your going, well, I'd better tell you
about the second of our ballots

1255
01:59:18,440 --> 01:59:21,649
as you know sadly we Iost Mam

1256
01:59:21,920 --> 01:59:27,324
and unfortunately we've good
and well frightened off her descendants

1257
01:59:27,600 --> 01:59:31,400
In short: we Iack a Mam!

1258
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:39,087
No!

1259
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:42,130
I needn't tell you that
you received every single vote

1260
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:44,291
Never!

1261
01:59:44,440 --> 01:59:52,803
with all your idealism, I think you'd enjoy being
the guardian of a kind of menagerie for creatures

1262
01:59:52,960 --> 01:59:55,486
who have no chance in the wild

1263
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:01,650
Just as you thought the notion
of a community would be good for us

1264
02:00:03,040 --> 02:00:08,251
You were so sure that you permitted
yourself to use force to convince us

1265
02:00:08,640 --> 02:00:12,087
I'II be sorry ifwe have to do Iikewise

1266
02:00:12,720 --> 02:00:16,805
what do you mean?
Do you intend to keep me prisoner?

1267
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:20,362
Only 'til you understand the
way you wanted us to understand

1268
02:00:20,920 --> 02:00:23,764
The gate has been
repaired and is closed

1269
02:00:24,360 --> 02:00:28,729
The fences are in good shape
but of course they ain't particularly high

1270
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:34,162
Those fences, come on

1271
02:00:35,640 --> 02:00:40,567
two men with a rusty
shot gun and a toy pistoI

1272
02:00:41,560 --> 02:00:44,404
How dumb do you really think we are?

1273
02:00:45,240 --> 02:00:48,881
Too dumb to build a Iadder
ifwe'd really wanted to get away?

1274
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:54,082
Grace had spent a great
deal of time on this meeting

1275
02:00:54,240 --> 02:00:57,369
which from her point of view
didn't seem to be getting anywhere

1276
02:00:57,840 --> 02:01:02,164
Her father and his car
would be at the gate at eight

1277
02:01:02,400 --> 02:01:06,166
That was in half an hour,
she had no Iadder

1278
02:01:06,320 --> 02:01:09,529
And she was on her
own and guarded by many

1279
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:13,202
Just how was she
to get out of Manderlay?

1280
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,807
when was a section
of the fence always down?

1281
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:23,769
Grace would have to change her tactics
rapidly if she was to make the rendez-vous

1282
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:27,323
All right, I'II do as you want

1283
02:01:28,280 --> 02:01:30,851
not from my heart, though
surely none ofyou could expect that

1284
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:36,325
but as my only option, and you needn't
be scared, I'II obey your beloved Iaw

1285
02:01:37,440 --> 02:01:40,523
So we'd better start by
dealing with the present matter:

1286
02:01:40,680 --> 02:01:48,326
Timothy, a slave from group seven has
committed a theft that almost ruined us alI

1287
02:01:48,560 --> 02:01:53,851
As I've determined that Mam's Law does not
prescribe any punishment for stealing money

1288
02:01:54,000 --> 02:01:56,128
I shall have to be creative

1289
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:03,810
what was it you once said, FIora, something
about planting a bottle of Rhenish wine?

1290
02:02:05,240 --> 02:02:13,489
I do believe there is a bottle of Rhenish
wine under Timothy's saddle, don't you?

1291
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:25,047
So that's what I seen when I went there
yesterday, if it wasn't a bottle of Rhenish wine!

1292
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:12,367
There was still ten minutes until her
slavishly punctual father would arrive outside

1293
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:16,206
to wait for his 15 minutes
and not a second Ionger

1294
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:20,331
Just enough time for
a verbal farewell salute

1295
02:03:26,040 --> 02:03:29,362
Timothy, you can stop
being proud and silent

1296
02:03:30,480 --> 02:03:39,924
Cry and shout and beg
for mercy Iike the Mansi you are

1297
02:03:40,760 --> 02:03:44,003
the Mansi who you despise so much

1298
02:03:45,320 --> 02:03:49,211
And it's that hatred Timothy and
the rest ofyou bear towards yourselves

1299
02:03:49,360 --> 02:03:57,245
that you'II never make me accept, you
are a cheat of the Iowest kind, and wilhelm

1300
02:03:57,760 --> 02:04:01,924
and all ofyou who follow him, are nothing
but a bunch of traitors to your race

1301
02:04:02,120 --> 02:04:08,401
I hope that your fellow Negroes one day
uncover your betrayal and punish you for it

1302
02:04:08,840 --> 02:04:11,127
You make me sick

1303
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:22,807
I'm sure you're quite right, Miss Grace, most
Iikely it's impossible to revile us niggers enough

1304
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:26,768
but what I don't get is
why it makes you so angry?

1305
02:04:26,920 --> 02:04:28,763
what do you mean?

1306
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:31,002
Aren't you forgetting something?

1307
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:36,968
You made us!

1308
02:04:58,960 --> 02:05:02,009
Probably the only thing that could
have stopped the Iady with the whip

1309
02:05:02,160 --> 02:05:08,202
from carrying on forever was the cheerful
tinkle that announced her father's presence

1310
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:18,889
She needed his support
now, Manderlay, too

1311
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:23,090
really was a place the world
would be better offwithout...

1312
02:05:34,760 --> 02:05:40,164
Grace recognized her father's
hand writing, "dear girl", it said

1313
02:05:40,320 --> 02:05:45,042
Dear girl, so you
tricked your father yet again

1314
02:05:45,320 --> 02:05:51,407
I waited the fifteen minutes
first but I am too kind hearted

1315
02:05:51,680 --> 02:05:58,131
So I popped over to the fence behind the bushes
and peeked inside to check that you were ok

1316
02:05:58,960 --> 02:06:04,729
to my great surprise it really did Iook
as ifyou had a good grip on things for once

1317
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:07,121
I am proud ofyou, my girI

1318
02:06:07,280 --> 02:06:09,089
I hope we meet up someday

1319
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:13,211
so you can tell me what you actually
meant by "new times at Manderlay"

1320
02:06:13,800 --> 02:06:17,361
Love, your dumb old dad

1321
02:06:24,880 --> 02:06:32,606
Ballots could be unrivalled, but determining
the time by public debate was rarely feasible

1322
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,206
That was quite apparent

1323
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:41,124
Grace had but a few
seconds to choose the direction

1324
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,807
in which to flee away
from her swarthy pursuers

1325
02:06:44,960 --> 02:06:49,966
who, as her father had to teasingly
predicted, were carrying torches

1326
02:06:50,480 --> 02:06:53,802
Grace was in a hurry
and did not notice Burt

1327
02:06:53,960 --> 02:06:59,842
the former fugitive with a Iiberal attitude
to other races, who never did make it far

1328
02:07:01,360 --> 02:07:09,848
Grace was angry: Manderlay had fossilized in a
picture of this country that was far, far too negative

1329
02:07:10,120 --> 02:07:14,045
America was a many-facetted
place, no doubt about it

1330
02:07:14,760 --> 02:07:18,287
But "not ready" to accept black people?

1331
02:07:18,720 --> 02:07:25,410
You really could not say that America
had proffered its hand, discreetly perhaps

1332
02:07:25,560 --> 02:07:33,604
but if anybody refused to see a helping
hand, he really only had himself to blame!
