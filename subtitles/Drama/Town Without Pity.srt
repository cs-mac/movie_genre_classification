1
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,303
<i>All day, the sun had boiled down
on the McBride barracks...</i>

2
00:00:56,903 --> 00:00:59,407
<i>...just as it had the long summer past.</i>

3
00:01:00,507 --> 00:01:03,610
<i>At 5:00 in the afternoon,
four Gls started out...</i>

4
00:01:03,645 --> 00:01:06,012
<i>...for the small German town nearby.</i>

5
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:11,887
<i>It was a Saturday
early in September 1960.</i>

6
00:01:35,108 --> 00:01:36,709
Afternoon, boys.

7
00:01:38,412 --> 00:01:40,681
Okay. The same?

8
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,483
Yeah.

9
00:01:44,885 --> 00:01:47,987
-Where's Elsie?
-Won't be here till 7:00.

10
00:01:49,088 --> 00:01:50,289
Great.

11
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:53,894
-Where the hell is Trude?
-Sorry. Not till 7:00.

12
00:02:11,111 --> 00:02:13,113
Give me a Coke, okay?

13
00:02:13,579 --> 00:02:16,583
If you want to have any fun
at all in this town...

14
00:02:16,683 --> 00:02:19,685
...you're gonna have to buy
something stronger than Coca-Cola.

15
00:02:20,886 --> 00:02:22,989
Chuck, lay off the kid, will you?

16
00:04:58,308 --> 00:05:00,276
<i>The girl was called Karin.</i>

17
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:03,281
<i>She had turned 16 last April.</i>

18
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:07,985
<i>The boy's name was Frank.
He was three years older...</i>

19
00:05:08,684 --> 00:05:11,087
<i>...the only son of a widowed mother.</i>

20
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:33,209
<i>Karin Steinhof and Frank Borgmann
had known each other since childhood...</i>

21
00:05:33,376 --> 00:05:35,678
<i>...but their love was new to them.</i>

22
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:56,899
<i>Frank's caution angered her.
She blamed it on his mother...</i>

23
00:05:56,999 --> 00:05:59,500
<i>...who she knew wanted to separate them.</i>

24
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:03,106
<i>"No one will separate us."</i>

25
00:06:04,608 --> 00:06:06,508
<i>"Then prove it to me."</i>

26
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,085
<i>"Of course no one was there...</i>

27
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,888
<i>"...no one but mama's shadow.</i>

28
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:54,590
<i>"Run along, mama's boy...</i>

29
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:57,794
<i>"...and tell mama she can
have her son all to herself."</i>

30
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,281
What a dish.

31
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,285
So long, fellas.

32
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:01,287
Hold it, Corporal. I saw it first.

33
00:09:38,084 --> 00:09:41,686
Come on, Jim. We got to go.
Get the hell out of there.

34
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,678
It's okay.

35
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:02,199
<i>"Get my clothes."</i>

36
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:11,675
<i>"I want my clothes."</i>

37
00:11:29,893 --> 00:11:32,694
<i>Nobody in town knew
about the crime yet...</i>

38
00:11:33,196 --> 00:11:35,098
<i>...not even Karin's father.</i>

39
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,501
<i>Herr Karl Steinhof
was the local bank manager.</i>

40
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:31,179
<i>The family doctor had given her a shot
to make her sleep.</i>

41
00:13:48,396 --> 00:13:50,398
<i>"And you let it happen.</i>

42
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:59,073
<i>"Just because there were four of them.</i>

43
00:14:02,077 --> 00:14:04,479
<i>"I'd have let them kill me first."</i>

44
00:14:25,298 --> 00:14:27,367
All right, Larkin, let's go.

45
00:15:02,068 --> 00:15:03,168
What was that for?

46
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,873
For leaving his shirt over that dame.

47
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,475
He might as well have left our dog tags!

48
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:11,578
You can get 10 years for this,
you know that? Maybe even 15.

49
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:17,183
Now, I told you before...

50
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,586
...you lay off the kid.

51
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:21,988
Randall, you listen to me.

52
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:26,192
From now on, any enlisted man
that gets into trouble, on duty or off...

53
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,694
...goes on the record
of the company commander.

54
00:15:28,795 --> 00:15:33,099
I've had a bellyful of this buck-passing.
What unit are these men in?

55
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,769
I want Capt. Nichols transferred
out of his command in 24 hours.

56
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:38,570
Do you understand? Right!

57
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:43,778
-How soon can you set up a court-martial?
-In about three or four weeks.

58
00:15:43,978 --> 00:15:47,380
Good. The sooner, the better.
Get Pakenham to prosecute. Where is he?

59
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,583
Judge Advocates' headquarters.

60
00:15:49,618 --> 00:15:52,986
Get him. You'd better get
the defense counsel from the outside, too.

61
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:56,489
Dowling, I want you
to be at the disposal of the girl's doctor.

62
00:15:56,524 --> 00:15:59,092
Medical consultations,
anything that he has in mind.

63
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:02,695
As far as she's concerned,
I want you to look after her personally.

64
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,997
-I'll do that.
-What about the press?

65
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,866
The whole town's in an uproar.

66
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,567
What did you expect?
A vote of confidence? A tribute?

67
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,469
Of course the town's in an uproar!

68
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:14,673
Damned animals prowling
around the countryside.

69
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:20,580
<i>-Yes?
-Burgermeister is calling on one.</i>

70
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:22,882
Right. I'll take it.

71
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,485
<i>Good morning, Herr Burgermeister.</i>

72
00:16:27,285 --> 00:16:29,487
That all sounds fine, Herr General...

73
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:34,593
...but if you pardon me for saying so,
people here want proof of good intentions.

74
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:36,595
I've tried to explain...

75
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,697
...that no army should be judged
by a few degenerates...

76
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,868
...but people are not open to reason
when an outrage occurs...

77
00:16:42,968 --> 00:16:44,970
...and it was an outrage!

78
00:16:45,171 --> 00:16:48,572
I quite agree with you,
and we intend to treat it as such.

79
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:52,677
We plan to have this trial wide open,
smack in the middle of the town.

80
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:56,080
Is there a public building
you could place at our disposal?

81
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:57,683
A fairly large one?

82
00:16:57,781 --> 00:17:00,185
I'm sure you can have
the high-school gymnasium.

83
00:17:00,284 --> 00:17:03,489
I want everybody to see
exactly how we handle a thing like this.

84
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:05,889
Yes?

85
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,794
<i>- Maj. Dowling is back, sir.
-Send him in. Our medical officer.</i>

86
00:17:11,495 --> 00:17:12,697
Did you see her?

87
00:17:12,796 --> 00:17:16,166
Just been at the hospital.
She's not well at all, sir.

88
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:19,772
-Bad state of shock.
-How will these men be punished?

89
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:23,375
That's the main thing.
That's what I have to tell my people.

90
00:17:23,574 --> 00:17:25,377
According to our military law...

91
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:28,780
...for rape there are various terms
of imprisonment at hard labor...

92
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,284
...depending on the degree of the crime.
The maximum penalty is death.

93
00:17:32,383 --> 00:17:35,887
Surely, a crime like that
calls for the maximum, doesn't it?

94
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:38,788
The prosecutor,
with my consent, asks the penalty...

95
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:43,194
...but the court, after hearing prosecution
and defense, decides the penalty.

96
00:17:43,593 --> 00:17:45,596
That's your law, I understand.

97
00:17:45,896 --> 00:17:48,467
But in the Army, between us...

98
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,669
...isn't it up to the General to decide?

99
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,072
Not in the American Army.

100
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:56,474
Who did you pick for the defense?

101
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,690
Boy!

102
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,674
<i>The first time I set eyes
on the defense counsel...</i>

103
00:19:03,874 --> 00:19:05,974
<i>...was when he walked into my hotel.</i>

104
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:07,376
Maj. Garrett, sir.

105
00:19:07,476 --> 00:19:09,480
-Yes?
-From the Judge Advocates' office.

106
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:11,481
Thank you, Sergeant.

107
00:19:12,883 --> 00:19:14,584
Major Garrett.

108
00:19:29,265 --> 00:19:33,068
The wheels of American justice
turn awfully fast, don't they, Major?

109
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,370
I beg your pardon?

110
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:37,673
I'm Inge Körner. I write for 'The Globus',
a German news weekly.

111
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,374
Yes, I've heard of it.

112
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,277
-Have you?
-And smelled it.

113
00:19:41,477 --> 00:19:43,879
You work for a rotten sheet, lady.

114
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:58,695
Do you consider it more fragrant work
defending four monsters?

115
00:20:00,363 --> 00:20:04,967
I've been assigned a job here. The
sooner it's finished, the happier I'll be.

116
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:07,370
So will a lot of people.

117
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,082
May I ask you a question?

118
00:20:21,181 --> 00:20:25,285
Miss Globus, or whatever your name is,
please stop following me.

119
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:28,590
I'm not the following type.
I'm interviewing you.

120
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:32,995
Congratulations. You've set a record
for the shortest interview in history.

121
00:20:35,164 --> 00:20:36,665
"Theaters of operation:

122
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,368
"Pacific, Korean, Italian, North African.

123
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:43,171
"Bronze star. Silver star with clusters."

124
00:20:44,472 --> 00:20:46,274
You puzzle me, Scott.

125
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,877
How can a man with your war record
behave like a low-down hood?

126
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:52,880
Maybe I just forgot
to declare peace, Major.

127
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:57,184
I don't have to be your lawyer.
You can choose anyone you want.

128
00:20:57,219 --> 00:20:59,587
I'll play the hand I drew, Major.

129
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:03,692
Were you drunk?

130
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,761
Can it. Stop hunting for the fancy motives.

131
00:21:06,796 --> 00:21:09,364
It was hot, I was in the mood,
and the dame was there.

132
00:21:09,463 --> 00:21:12,065
-How drunk were you?
-Just happy.

133
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:16,671
Was there anything in the girl's attitude
that excited you?

134
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:21,276
Wouldn't a naked girl excite you, Major?

135
00:21:23,677 --> 00:21:25,880
You make me wish I was on the other side.

136
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,981
Can't you get it through your thick skull?
This is serious.

137
00:21:29,383 --> 00:21:32,286
You'll hang or spend a lot of time
on a rock pile.

138
00:21:32,386 --> 00:21:36,890
I didn't do nothing she didn't let me do.
She was just lying there nice and quiet...

139
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,660
...and real pretty.
Prettiest little thing you ever saw.

140
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,063
Your story sounds
like a valentine message.

141
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,766
Don't get me wrong.
I believe you, every word of it.

142
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,868
Go ahead, you can tell me.

143
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,273
It was just something that came over me.

144
00:21:53,874 --> 00:21:57,177
Something goes wild inside me,
and I don't care who the girl is...

145
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:58,978
...or how much she begs.

146
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,082
I just don't pay any attention to her.
She hasn't got a chance.

147
00:22:03,383 --> 00:22:04,685
Sit down.

148
00:22:06,887 --> 00:22:08,988
Why didn't you run away
when the others did?

149
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,564
It seemed like such a shame
to leave her there all alone like that.

150
00:22:19,364 --> 00:22:21,868
You did put your shirt
over her, didn't you?

151
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:23,469
Yeah.

152
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:24,772
Why?

153
00:22:27,874 --> 00:22:29,274
I don't know.

154
00:22:30,177 --> 00:22:32,478
She looked so small lying there.

155
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,181
I couldn't leave her like that.

156
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:38,785
Got a girl back home?

157
00:22:39,485 --> 00:22:42,188
Sure, everybody's got a girl back home.

158
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,559
Are you sorry for what you did?

159
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:48,660
Sure, I'm sorry, Major.

160
00:22:48,761 --> 00:22:51,264
-Larkin...
-The thing is...

161
00:22:51,864 --> 00:22:55,068
I don't know. I keep thinking
maybe I'll do it again, you know?

162
00:22:55,368 --> 00:22:59,071
I'm telling you this for the last time,
stop selling yourself.

163
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:03,476
I'm sure your mom thinks you ought to
be president, but I can't use it in court.

164
00:23:03,576 --> 00:23:06,979
I guess I'm a little nervous
about how this will look on my record.

165
00:23:07,014 --> 00:23:10,081
Record? I've seen it.
It's enough to gag a hyena.

166
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:13,485
Personally, I hate your guts,
but I have to defend you.

167
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,089
I'm sorry. I'll do anything I can to help.

168
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,692
Thanks.

169
00:23:19,693 --> 00:23:22,961
-Then you saw her smoking a cigarette.
-That's right.

170
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:26,363
We thought it was funny
for her to be standing all by herself...

171
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,569
Stick to the facts. Then did you drag her
into the bushes and pull her clothes off?

172
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:32,469
No, we just kept watching.

173
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,516
You won't believe this, but all of a

174
00:23:34,517 --> 00:23:36,875
sudden, that little
dame took off her bra...

175
00:23:36,976 --> 00:23:40,378
...and slipped off her pants,
and she stood there, naked as a jaybird.

176
00:23:40,478 --> 00:23:42,581
Wait a minute. Stood there?

177
00:23:43,081 --> 00:23:46,985
-You mean she started to get dressed.
-No, sir, she didn't.

178
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,888
You're lying.

179
00:23:50,988 --> 00:23:52,490
No, sir.

180
00:23:53,091 --> 00:23:55,160
I wouldn't lie to you.

181
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,863
It sure looked to us
like she was just asking for it.

182
00:23:57,962 --> 00:24:01,165
I see. Then maybe we ought
to charge her with rape.

183
00:24:01,766 --> 00:24:04,568
-Sit down, Snyder.
-Yes, sir.

184
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,272
Quite a record you have here.
Your mother would just be proud.

185
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:29,761
-I will not permit it.
-I must agree with your wife, Steinhof.

186
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:32,664
Karin must not be upset.
Keep her quiet. Let her rest.

187
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,766
You want these swine to go free?

188
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:38,168
Wouldn't that set off a celebration
out there at the barracks...

189
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,271
...if it doesn't cost anything?

190
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:44,273
Next week, they'll come back and pick
another young girl for their amusement.

191
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:46,177
Is that what you want?

192
00:25:48,872 --> 00:25:51,975
Don't you think
it will be easier for Miss Steinhof...

193
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,977
...if we turn the bed around?

194
00:25:58,382 --> 00:26:01,183
I'm sorry, according to law,
they have to be present...

195
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:03,685
...but you won't have to look at them.

196
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:08,056
I know you speak English.
However, if you have any difficulty...

197
00:26:08,157 --> 00:26:10,560
...Lt. Dunn, our interpreter,
is here to help you.

198
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,964
As prosecutor, it's my duty
to ask you a number of questions.

199
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:16,866
Some will be painful
and embarrassing to you...

200
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:20,169
...but you must answer them
because only you know what happened...

201
00:26:20,268 --> 00:26:23,072
...and only your testimony
can legally prove the crimes.

202
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:26,375
After I'm through, Maj. Garrett will
question you for the defense.

203
00:26:26,475 --> 00:26:30,579
-Maj. Dowling, will you swear her in?
-Please, raise your right hand.

204
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:33,381
Do you swear the evidence you give
shall be the truth...

205
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,885
...and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

206
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,986
I do.

207
00:26:40,655 --> 00:26:43,858
I now draw your attention
to the events of September 5.

208
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:46,161
Late in the afternoon,
you went swimming...

209
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:49,065
...with Frank Borgmann
in the river near the dam. Correct?

210
00:26:49,463 --> 00:26:50,366
Yes.

211
00:26:50,466 --> 00:26:54,269
As it started to get dark,
you swam back to get dressed. Right?

212
00:26:54,368 --> 00:26:55,272
Yes.

213
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:57,572
Now tell us exactly what happened...

214
00:26:57,673 --> 00:27:00,575
...when you got back
to where your clothes were.

215
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:05,781
Suddenly, I felt something in back of me.

216
00:27:06,982 --> 00:27:09,984
I turned around, and there was a man.

217
00:27:10,885 --> 00:27:12,988
Is that man in this room now?

218
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:16,057
Yes.

219
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:18,459
Can you point him out to us?

220
00:27:21,963 --> 00:27:24,165
There, on the right.

221
00:27:24,666 --> 00:27:26,066
The first one.

222
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:30,171
Let the record reflect the witness
has identified defendant, Sgt. Snyder.

223
00:27:31,272 --> 00:27:34,975
You turned around, and you saw this man.
Then what happened?

224
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,779
He put his hand out toward me.

225
00:27:40,082 --> 00:27:43,285
I was scared. I couldn't move.

226
00:27:44,384 --> 00:27:46,854
Then he grabbed me.

227
00:27:48,556 --> 00:27:49,658
And then?

228
00:27:51,258 --> 00:27:54,462
I screamed, but he wouldn't let go of me.

229
00:27:54,661 --> 00:27:58,565
I kept on hitting him, his face, all over.

230
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:02,668
He held his hand over my mouth.
I could hardly breathe.

231
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:07,874
Then he dragged me into the bushes,
and suddenly...

232
00:28:07,975 --> 00:28:09,677
...there were three other men.

233
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:12,880
Are those three men present
in this room now?

234
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,684
-Yes.
-Will you point them out to us?

235
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:20,754
That one, that one and that one!

236
00:28:21,053 --> 00:28:24,458
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified Cpl. Scott...

237
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:26,360
...Cpl. Larkin, and Priv. Haines.

238
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:29,262
Please, go on.

239
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:33,767
They...

240
00:28:35,168 --> 00:28:37,270
They threw me to the ground.

241
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:39,172
And then?

242
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:41,374
Then...

243
00:28:42,174 --> 00:28:43,777
...they held me down...

244
00:28:44,879 --> 00:28:46,179
...until he...

245
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:47,980
God.

246
00:28:48,081 --> 00:28:49,683
They forced me.

247
00:28:53,454 --> 00:28:55,855
Which one of the men disrobed you?

248
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:04,764
Objection. I don't think Miss Steinhof has
indicated she was disrobed at any time.

249
00:29:05,964 --> 00:29:08,066
Okay, we'll do it the hard way.

250
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:11,771
When they held you down,
were you still wearing your bathing suit?

251
00:29:14,874 --> 00:29:15,875
No.

252
00:29:16,576 --> 00:29:20,880
Do you remember at what point
you first found yourself naked?

253
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:26,752
No. No.

254
00:29:28,653 --> 00:29:32,458
When Sgt. Snyder first grabbed you,
you weren't naked, were you?

255
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:37,963
I don't know.

256
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:43,769
No.

257
00:29:45,171 --> 00:29:49,574
Sometime in between,
did one of the men disrobe you?

258
00:29:51,177 --> 00:29:53,380
-Yes.
-Which one?

259
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:55,981
They were all...

260
00:29:56,782 --> 00:29:58,084
I don't remember.

261
00:30:00,052 --> 00:30:04,358
Before going on to the next defendant,
Maj. Garrett will ask you his questions.

262
00:30:10,162 --> 00:30:11,763
I have no questions.

263
00:30:13,365 --> 00:30:14,966
Go on, Colonel.

264
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:43,661
-Are you tagging me, lady?
-All day.

265
00:30:44,061 --> 00:30:47,364
Love to watch a clever defense counsel
prepare his case...

266
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,867
...or shall I call it his whitewash?

267
00:30:50,668 --> 00:30:52,672
Call it anything you want.

268
00:30:53,171 --> 00:30:54,973
I read your last opus.

269
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:57,476
You like it?

270
00:30:58,175 --> 00:30:59,676
Crazy about it.

271
00:31:00,177 --> 00:31:03,081
Can't think of a better way
to stir up trouble.

272
00:31:03,182 --> 00:31:05,782
You've got a real talent there, Fraulein.

273
00:31:19,162 --> 00:31:22,866
Do you really think freedom of the press
is an American monopoly?

274
00:31:23,268 --> 00:31:24,368
Nope.

275
00:31:24,669 --> 00:31:28,471
Everybody's got the same right
to dig in the mud pile.

276
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:37,181
<i>- Guten morgen.
-Hold it.</i>

277
00:31:39,182 --> 00:31:40,851
Do me a favor, will you?

278
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:42,753
Just stand right there.

279
00:31:43,754 --> 00:31:45,255
You're the girl.

280
00:31:45,354 --> 00:31:48,358
Just a moment ago,
you're over there with a boy...

281
00:31:48,458 --> 00:31:50,661
...probably necking, wouldn't you imagine?

282
00:31:50,761 --> 00:31:52,963
You're the one who's imagining.

283
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:55,064
Okay, you were necking.

284
00:31:55,866 --> 00:32:00,272
Then, for some reason, you left him,
swam back to your clothes...

285
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:04,974
...and over there in the bushes,
those four goons are watching, right?

286
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:06,576
Whatever you say.

287
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,882
You shouldn't be so acquiescent.
Get into trouble that way.

288
00:32:15,251 --> 00:32:18,854
You're here.
All you've got on is a wet bikini.

289
00:32:19,756 --> 00:32:23,358
-This is where your clothes are...
-Just to keep the record straight...

290
00:32:23,459 --> 00:32:27,464
...I've got my clothes on
and that's exactly where they're staying.

291
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,965
Just imagining.

292
00:32:32,168 --> 00:32:36,172
Anyway, you're standing in a wet bikini.
What's the first thing you do?

293
00:32:36,874 --> 00:32:37,974
Sneeze.

294
00:32:38,574 --> 00:32:41,277
Look, save the jokes for your literature.

295
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,781
-What would you do?
-Get into my dress.

296
00:32:44,816 --> 00:32:45,782
Exactly.

297
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:48,050
Before that,
you have to do something else.

298
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,252
Like what?

299
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:53,656
Don't tell me you'd put those nice, dry
clothes on over that dripping bikini.

300
00:32:54,357 --> 00:32:55,657
I suppose not.

301
00:32:56,258 --> 00:32:57,759
You know not.

302
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,064
Before you get dressed,
you have to get undressed, don't you?

303
00:33:02,164 --> 00:33:03,866
In theory, maybe.

304
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,572
Tell me, which would you take off first?
The bra or the shorts?

305
00:33:12,374 --> 00:33:14,376
-The bra.
-Good.

306
00:33:15,177 --> 00:33:16,378
That's off.

307
00:33:16,879 --> 00:33:20,850
-Then you bend over...
-And I take off the rest like this.

308
00:33:21,449 --> 00:33:23,852
Does this satisfy your dirty mind?

309
00:33:24,953 --> 00:33:27,355
It wouldn't if I really had a dirty mind.

310
00:33:30,558 --> 00:33:32,761
Tell me, what are you trying to prove here?

311
00:33:33,062 --> 00:33:37,266
That Karin Steinhof seduced those four
brave, innocent American boys?

312
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,870
Just wondering
how long she stood around here naked.

313
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:46,275
Really, Miss Koerner...

314
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:49,377
...don't you think
you've flaunted yourself long enough?

315
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:52,981
You'd better get some clothes on.

316
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:56,251
<i>Maj. Garrett made the rounds...</i>

317
00:33:56,551 --> 00:34:00,055
<i>...picking up information from
Karin's neighbors and friends...</i>

318
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:02,056
<i>...and enemies.</i>

319
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:05,059
<i>At the school,
her spinster teachers' malice...</i>

320
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:07,361
<i>...was as obvious as their smiles.</i>

321
00:34:11,866 --> 00:34:16,370
<i>At the ice-cream bar where she and young
Borgmann held hands after school...</i>

322
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:21,075
<i>...the proprietor jumped at the chance
to sound off on wayward youth.</i>

323
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,353
<i>But the boy's mother was more subtle
and more vicious.</i>

324
00:34:32,854 --> 00:34:36,857
<i>Frank was all she had in the world,
and he'd been all hers until...</i>

325
00:34:37,457 --> 00:34:39,560
Frank, you're home early.

326
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,163
-This is Major...
-I know who he is.

327
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:45,966
You were at school today
asking questions about Karin.

328
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,167
That's right.

329
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:49,470
Now you're here. What did you tell him?

330
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:53,174
Then keep him away from here.

331
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:56,877
-All he wants is gossip.
-You see?

332
00:34:57,079 --> 00:34:59,380
He gets more difficult every day.

333
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,750
It's understandable. He's in love.

334
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:04,652
Love.

335
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:08,155
What would a 19-year-old boy
know about love?

336
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:11,157
I work like a dog here, just for him...

337
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:15,162
...but she's got him so mixed up
he doesn't know what he's doing anymore.

338
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:17,364
-His marks are bad...
-Don't get so upset.

339
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:21,369
I don't want to say anything against Karin.
There's been too much scandal already.

340
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:23,169
Yes, I understand.

341
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:26,073
Maybe we'd better continue our chat
some other time.

342
00:35:28,174 --> 00:35:30,276
And thank you very much.

343
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,250
Soda?

344
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:16,155
I and Elsie had a date
with them that night.

345
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:20,760
If they'd only waited for us,
it maybe never would have happened.

346
00:36:20,795 --> 00:36:24,063
-You know all four of them?
-Sure. All except...

347
00:36:24,162 --> 00:36:28,568
-I don't know the kid so well. Jim...
-Larkin.

348
00:36:29,368 --> 00:36:33,372
-Did you ever go out with him?
-Just once, but he was too shy.

349
00:36:35,073 --> 00:36:37,077
Were the other three shy, too?

350
00:36:37,276 --> 00:36:39,079
No. They are nice guys.

351
00:36:39,177 --> 00:36:43,449
I'm sorry they got in trouble,
but the trial's good for business.

352
00:36:43,548 --> 00:36:44,650
How do you mean?

353
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:47,051
Why do you think
we got such a crowd tonight?

354
00:36:47,152 --> 00:36:50,956
Because they are so scared they're
leaving the town girls alone for a change.

355
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:55,160
Curt's watching. I'm not supposed
to sit here unless you buy another round.

356
00:36:58,262 --> 00:37:00,566
How long are they going
to keep them locked up?

357
00:37:01,066 --> 00:37:04,469
It may not be very long.
They're asking the death sentence.

358
00:37:05,271 --> 00:37:06,371
Death?

359
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:10,074
That shows what happens
when you go out with town girls.

360
00:37:10,174 --> 00:37:12,377
You love these town girls, don't you?

361
00:37:12,577 --> 00:37:14,746
Yeah, like poison.

362
00:37:17,548 --> 00:37:19,551
So fine and fancy...

363
00:37:20,051 --> 00:37:22,153
...turning up their stupid noses at us.

364
00:37:22,452 --> 00:37:26,458
But, brother, when nobody's looking,
you should see them go to it.

365
00:37:27,058 --> 00:37:31,063
And don't think sweet little Miss Steinhof
is such a lily either.

366
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:34,064
-Has she got people fooled.
-How do you know?

367
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:37,069
My cousin does housework
and cooking for the Steinhofs.

368
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:38,770
She's seen Karin at work.

369
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:42,072
Dames are the same under the skin
when it comes to that.

370
00:37:42,172 --> 00:37:45,576
-Does she work there every day?
-Sure. Why?

371
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:48,045
Do you think she'll do you a little favor?

372
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:50,748
More than a little.

373
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:54,052
Curt's got his eye on us again.

374
00:37:55,152 --> 00:37:56,354
Make it three.

375
00:37:56,454 --> 00:37:59,357
-Miss Koerner, sit down.
-Thanks.

376
00:38:00,558 --> 00:38:03,561
-Giving a party, Major?
-This is Trude, a friend of mine.

377
00:38:03,761 --> 00:38:05,763
Miss Körner, a town girl.

378
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:10,267
Don't forget there's a house commission
if you take him out.

379
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,469
Does she resent my amateur status?

380
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:16,274
-Wouldn't you? A good kid, though.
-I'm sure. Charming.

381
00:38:16,874 --> 00:38:18,875
Tell me, Major.

382
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:20,945
May I ask you a question?

383
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:22,046
Can I stop you?

384
00:38:22,547 --> 00:38:23,647
Stephen Garrett.

385
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:26,249
"Universities: Wisconsin and Columbia.

386
00:38:26,349 --> 00:38:29,252
"Married: twice. Divorced: twice.

387
00:38:29,853 --> 00:38:32,556
"Children: none. Purple hearts: two."

388
00:38:32,957 --> 00:38:36,661
Now snooping in every corner of the town,
collecting filth...

389
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,987
...to throw at a little
girl who's lying in

390
00:38:38,988 --> 00:38:41,264
a hospital bed for
reasons we won't mention.

391
00:38:41,765 --> 00:38:43,267
You like the work?

392
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:45,368
I get a bang out of it.

393
00:38:47,671 --> 00:38:50,173
One night in Korea,
I had to shoot an enlisted man.

394
00:38:50,274 --> 00:38:54,144
He'd gone berserk and was setting off
flares in a concealed position.

395
00:38:54,179 --> 00:38:57,948
Just 10 feet away from me,
and I killed him just like that.

396
00:38:59,049 --> 00:39:00,951
I got a bang out of that, too.

397
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:05,154
It's a touching story.

398
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:09,460
You should tell it to Karin Steinhof.
She could have a good cry over it.

399
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:12,361
If these four men hang,
that will cheer her up.

400
00:39:12,461 --> 00:39:14,765
That wipes it all out,
everything's rosy again.

401
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:17,767
Nothing will ever wipe it out for her.

402
00:39:17,866 --> 00:39:20,469
Why do we even have a trial,
why don't we lynch 'em?

403
00:39:20,671 --> 00:39:25,275
The mob's big enough:
you, the newspapers, the town, the brass.

404
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:30,046
Why do you think the law provides them
with a counsel to defend them?

405
00:39:30,446 --> 00:39:32,147
So that he doesn't defend them?

406
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:36,352
It would have cost them four lousy bucks
right here at the Florida Bar.

407
00:39:36,852 --> 00:39:40,756
To risk your neck for something that cheap
you'd have to be sick, wouldn't you?

408
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:42,657
Crazy, stupid and sick!

409
00:39:55,571 --> 00:39:58,474
You get pretty upset about things,
don't you?

410
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:01,744
When it comes to hanging people, yes.

411
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:04,848
At least I found out
what I wanted to know.

412
00:40:05,048 --> 00:40:07,849
-What's that?
-How you feel about your work.

413
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:11,453
You know more than I do.

414
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:14,755
Excuse me.

415
00:40:33,074 --> 00:40:36,545
Can your cousin get something for me
from the Steinhof house?

416
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,945
Just name it.

417
00:40:38,947 --> 00:40:42,451
I'd like to take a look at the bikini
she wore that afternoon.

418
00:41:08,643 --> 00:41:12,246
I do not understand. Negotiate?

419
00:41:12,746 --> 00:41:16,651
Herr Steinhof, a negotiated plea
means that if I'm convinced...

420
00:41:16,852 --> 00:41:20,854
...of the defendant's guilt, I can see
the prosecutor in advance of the trial...

421
00:41:20,889 --> 00:41:23,758
...and the two of us can work out
a satisfactory sentence.

422
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:28,363
Then are you prepared
to plead your defendants guilty?

423
00:41:28,963 --> 00:41:32,866
Three of them, yes, if Pakenham agrees
to limit the sentence to 20 years...

424
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:34,468
...and dishonorable discharge.

425
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:37,972
Three? There were four men.
Everybody knows there are four.

426
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:40,239
I'm not convinced
all four of them are guilty.

427
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,744
In the case of Cpl. Larkin,
I must reserve freedom of action.

428
00:41:44,046 --> 00:41:45,045
Colonel?

429
00:41:45,246 --> 00:41:48,448
I find the evidence of guilt in this case
so overwhelming...

430
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:51,652
...a negotiated plea
is out of the question.

431
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,858
What penalty have you in mind, Colonel?

432
00:41:58,259 --> 00:42:00,760
In view of the singular brutality
of this crime...

433
00:42:00,861 --> 00:42:04,166
...I have no choice but to ask
your approval of the death sentence.

434
00:42:06,966 --> 00:42:08,569
Sir, this is a dirty case.

435
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:11,472
Nobody comes out of a dirty case
as clean as he went in.

436
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:14,141
It's bad for the town.
It's bad for the Army.

437
00:42:14,541 --> 00:42:16,343
It's worse for the girl.

438
00:42:16,644 --> 00:42:20,947
In my opinion, justice won't be served
if the death penalty's invoked.

439
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,450
In Germany...

440
00:42:23,549 --> 00:42:27,053
In Germany, Herr Steinhof,
you don't even have capital punishment.

441
00:42:27,452 --> 00:42:29,356
The death penalty is on our books.

442
00:42:29,391 --> 00:42:31,958
I'm inclined to believe
there must be a reason.

443
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:35,763
If you don't ask the maximum
for this crime, when do you ask it?

444
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:38,165
Very well, Colonel.

445
00:42:38,465 --> 00:42:41,367
We are not interested
in negotiating the plea, Major.

446
00:42:41,402 --> 00:42:44,370
Sir, may I say one more word
to Herr Steinhof?

447
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,040
Thank you.

448
00:42:47,941 --> 00:42:51,444
Do you realize what a terrible strain
this will be on your daughter?

449
00:42:55,148 --> 00:42:56,849
To testify at this trial?

450
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:00,953
The death penalty worries Maj. Garrett,
not your daughter.

451
00:43:01,053 --> 00:43:03,457
By law,
she's obliged to take the witness stand.

452
00:43:03,556 --> 00:43:07,159
She must remain there until
she completes her entire testimony.

453
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:11,063
If she does not do so,
then the death penalty cannot be invoked.

454
00:43:11,098 --> 00:43:13,666
-But it must be!
-Not if I can help it.

455
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:17,870
With a negotiated plea,
Karin won't have to testify...

456
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:20,538
...and I'd much prefer
not to cross-examine her.

457
00:43:20,573 --> 00:43:23,443
But hasn't she already
been cross-examined?

458
00:43:23,642 --> 00:43:25,143
Not by me.

459
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:27,346
Not in a public courtroom.

460
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:31,551
My questions won't be as gentle
as Col. Pakenham's.

461
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,154
You don't have to worry
about my daughter, sir.

462
00:43:36,255 --> 00:43:38,156
Nonetheless, I do.

463
00:43:40,658 --> 00:43:41,860
I do.

464
00:44:31,041 --> 00:44:34,746
<i>The trial began on Tuesday, October 10...</i>

465
00:44:35,145 --> 00:44:38,149
<i>...at 9:00 p. m.
in the high- school gymnasium.</i>

466
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,452
This court will come to order.

467
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,539
This court-martial is convened...

468
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:06,143
...at the Ludwig High School,
Neustadt, Germany...

469
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:09,847
...by order of Maj. Gen.
Lucius B. Strafford, commanding.

470
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:13,251
This is to be tried as
a capital case of rape.

471
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:16,153
Therefore, I'd like to question the court.

472
00:45:16,753 --> 00:45:18,856
You may proceed with your questioning.

473
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:20,557
Col. Weldon.

474
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,460
If the accused are found guilty...

475
00:45:24,561 --> 00:45:28,564
...and the evidence of this case warrants
it, will you object to the death penalty?

476
00:45:28,665 --> 00:45:29,668
No, sir.

477
00:45:30,567 --> 00:45:32,268
Lt. Col. McKenna.

478
00:45:33,737 --> 00:45:37,840
If the evidence of this case warrants it,
will you object to the death penalty?

479
00:45:38,041 --> 00:45:39,342
No, sir.

480
00:45:39,744 --> 00:45:41,243
Maj. Miller.

481
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:44,547
If the evidence warrants it,
will you object to the death penalty?

482
00:45:44,648 --> 00:45:45,648
No, sir.

483
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,551
Maj. Fodowsky.

484
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:52,856
If the evidence warrants it,
will you object to the death penalty?

485
00:45:53,156 --> 00:45:54,757
No, sir. Not in the least.

486
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:58,962
Capt. Horner,
if the evidence of this case warrants it...

487
00:45:59,062 --> 00:46:01,163
...will you object to the death penalty?

488
00:46:01,565 --> 00:46:02,665
No, sir.

489
00:46:03,566 --> 00:46:07,537
Lt. Kennedy,
if the evidence of this case warrants it...

490
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,742
Sgt. Browning.

491
00:46:13,342 --> 00:46:17,646
If the evidence of this case warrants it,
will you object to the death penalty?

492
00:46:17,746 --> 00:46:18,947
No, sir.

493
00:46:19,549 --> 00:46:21,050
Thank you, gentlemen.

494
00:46:21,852 --> 00:46:23,052
Maj. Garrett.

495
00:46:23,152 --> 00:46:25,254
Defense asserts
two peremptory challenges.

496
00:46:25,354 --> 00:46:27,557
Lt. Col. McKenna and Maj. Fodowsky.

497
00:46:27,758 --> 00:46:31,160
Lt. Col. McKenna
and Maj. Fodowsky will be excused.

498
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,043
The court will now be sworn.

499
00:46:51,646 --> 00:46:53,548
Proceed, Maj. Garrett.

500
00:46:53,749 --> 00:46:59,054
There's already on record a deposition
which the prosecutrix made in the hospital.

501
00:46:59,454 --> 00:47:03,158
I move that, in view of her health
the court refrain from calling on her...

502
00:47:03,259 --> 00:47:05,560
...in order to spare
her additional strain...

503
00:47:05,661 --> 00:47:07,962
...and the embarrassment
of public testimony.

504
00:47:08,063 --> 00:47:11,867
May it please the court,
I should only have wished the accused...

505
00:47:11,966 --> 00:47:14,736
...would have shown the same concern
for the prosecutrix...

506
00:47:14,836 --> 00:47:16,838
...as the Major himself now displays.

507
00:47:17,037 --> 00:47:19,542
Counsel for the defense
is surely not unaware...

508
00:47:19,641 --> 00:47:22,544
...that the death penalty
can only be given in this case...

509
00:47:22,644 --> 00:47:25,847
...if the prosecutrix is available
for testimony in person.

510
00:47:26,046 --> 00:47:28,650
I therefore move that
the motion be denied.

511
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:30,851
Motion denied.

512
00:47:31,052 --> 00:47:32,554
Trial counsel may proceed.

513
00:47:32,954 --> 00:47:34,255
Sgt. Snyder.

514
00:47:35,757 --> 00:47:39,061
-How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty?
-Not guilty, sir.

515
00:47:39,861 --> 00:47:41,163
Cpl. Scott.

516
00:47:42,263 --> 00:47:43,665
Not guilty, sir.

517
00:47:44,866 --> 00:47:46,167
Priv. Haines.

518
00:47:46,367 --> 00:47:47,535
Not guilty, sir.

519
00:47:48,235 --> 00:47:49,538
Cpl. Larkin.

520
00:47:54,943 --> 00:47:57,745
Please answer the question.
Guilty or not guilty?

521
00:47:58,146 --> 00:48:00,647
Sir, I know how I'm supposed to plead...

522
00:48:01,349 --> 00:48:03,150
...but I also know what I did.

523
00:48:03,651 --> 00:48:07,856
If I'm to be honest, I have to plead
guilty, because I am guilty. I did...

524
00:48:07,956 --> 00:48:09,157
Disregard that.

525
00:48:09,256 --> 00:48:13,161
By law, he can plead not guilty and place
the burden of proof on the prosecution.

526
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,362
-But, sir I did...
-Therefore...

527
00:48:15,863 --> 00:48:19,066
If it pleases the court, Cpl. Larkin
changes his plea to not guilty.

528
00:48:20,335 --> 00:48:21,936
Proceed, Col. Pakenham.

529
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:16,456
Next witness, Frank Borgmann, please.

530
00:49:24,565 --> 00:49:26,631
We have another room for you, Fraulein.

531
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,436
It will be more quiet there.
-Thank you.

532
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:47,754
Do you swear the evidence
you'll give to be the truth...

533
00:49:47,853 --> 00:49:49,956
...and nothing but the truth?

534
00:49:49,991 --> 00:49:51,057
I do.

535
00:49:51,657 --> 00:49:56,562
-State your full name, age and profession.
-Frank Borgmann, 19, student.

536
00:49:56,762 --> 00:50:00,532
-Do you know the accused in this case?
-Yes, two of them.

537
00:50:00,933 --> 00:50:02,334
Him and him.

538
00:50:03,936 --> 00:50:08,140
And that's where I found her, lying
on the ground, a man's shirt over her.

539
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:11,243
-What did she have on under the shirt?
-Nothing.

540
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:13,346
Then what occurred?

541
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:15,548
I helped her get dressed.

542
00:50:15,647 --> 00:50:18,551
I carried her through the forest
until I got to the road.

543
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,353
A car gave us a lift.

544
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:22,855
Why did you carry her?

545
00:50:24,455 --> 00:50:26,758
Because she couldn't walk by herself.

546
00:50:30,062 --> 00:50:31,463
No further questions.

547
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:35,034
You said you and Karin
had taken a sunbath.

548
00:50:35,133 --> 00:50:39,136
It was getting dark, Karin had to go home.
She swam across to get dressed.

549
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:41,539
-Is that correct?
-Yes.

550
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,242
The current's pretty
strong there, isn't it?

551
00:50:44,943 --> 00:50:45,943
Yes.

552
00:50:46,345 --> 00:50:48,446
Why did you allow her to swim back alone?

553
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,554
-Please, answer the question.
-I don't know.

554
00:50:54,653 --> 00:50:56,654
I don't remember anymore.

555
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,158
You don't remember anymore?

556
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:00,660
Yes, I do.

557
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,963
I mean, it was kind of late.
She was in a hurry to go home.

558
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:08,132
Isn't it usual in Germany
to see a young lady home?

559
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:10,235
Of course, but...

560
00:51:10,635 --> 00:51:13,237
But this time, you didn't. Why not?

561
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,142
I was going to take her home.

562
00:51:17,177 --> 00:51:19,445
I wanted to give her time to get dressed.

563
00:51:21,846 --> 00:51:26,450
While you were lying there
taking this sunbath, did you two kiss?

564
00:51:26,551 --> 00:51:27,552
Probably.

565
00:51:28,353 --> 00:51:29,654
We kiss sometimes.

566
00:51:29,955 --> 00:51:33,658
Thank you, Herr Borgmann.
I reserve the right to call him back later.

567
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,031
At first, I couldn't believe it.

568
00:51:45,335 --> 00:51:47,338
"And something so bestial."

569
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:53,243
I knew I should call Dr. Urban...

570
00:51:53,278 --> 00:51:56,048
...but I was so mixed up.

571
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,348
Frank had to call for me.

572
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,350
Was she unconscious?

573
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:03,753
-Please?
-Was she in her senses?

574
00:52:03,788 --> 00:52:05,056
Did she know you?

575
00:52:08,557 --> 00:52:11,662
Yes, but she didn't speak.

576
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:21,739
On the contrary,
I always encourage my daughter...

577
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:23,340
...to go in for sports:

578
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:27,644
Skiing, tennis, swimming,
all kinds of exercise.

579
00:52:27,845 --> 00:52:30,846
That's what made her such a healthy,
happy girl.

580
00:52:31,146 --> 00:52:32,848
A girl I was proud of.

581
00:52:33,149 --> 00:52:37,252
I think we all realize the difficulties
of bringing a young girl up...

582
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:39,857
...among the dangers and temptations
of modern life.

583
00:52:39,957 --> 00:52:43,160
Tell me, did Karin ever give you
cause for concern in this...

584
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,163
Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.

585
00:52:46,629 --> 00:52:49,933
I'm attempting to establish
the character of the prosecutrix...

586
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:51,835
...before the events of this trial.

587
00:52:52,035 --> 00:52:54,137
Mr. Law Officer...

588
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,543
Objection withdrawn.

589
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,447
Karin never gave us
anything but happiness.

590
00:53:04,947 --> 00:53:08,552
Even as a small child,
she made friends wherever she went.

591
00:53:09,151 --> 00:53:13,656
My wife and I could always trust her
100 percent.

592
00:53:14,056 --> 00:53:18,360
If we told her to be home at 10:00,
she was home at 10:00 on the dot.

593
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:22,130
Tell me, Herr Steinhof,
have you had any indication...

594
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:26,436
...that Karin's future has been damaged
through this experience?

595
00:53:26,735 --> 00:53:29,037
I have, indeed, unfortunately.

596
00:53:29,738 --> 00:53:32,942
I've received anonymous letters
in this town...

597
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,244
...hinting...

598
00:53:36,445 --> 00:53:37,647
"Evil."

599
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:40,448
Yes, evil things about my daughter.

600
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:44,452
Karin had the whole world
open to her until...

601
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:49,959
Until those animals over there
smashed everything to bits!

602
00:53:50,258 --> 00:53:54,730
Objection. I move that the last sentence
be stricken and the court to disregard it.

603
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:56,430
They are animals!

604
00:53:56,832 --> 00:53:58,433
Hanging is too good for them!

605
00:54:03,638 --> 00:54:05,940
There'll be no
demonstrations in this court.

606
00:54:06,041 --> 00:54:08,843
Unless silence is observed,
I'll have the room cleared.

607
00:54:09,745 --> 00:54:11,346
Objection sustained.

608
00:54:11,947 --> 00:54:14,650
Strike the witness' last two sentences
from the record.

609
00:54:14,848 --> 00:54:16,450
No further questions.

610
00:54:16,852 --> 00:54:18,652
Thank you, Herr Steinhof.

611
00:54:18,687 --> 00:54:20,854
Just a minute, Herr Steinhof.

612
00:54:22,757 --> 00:54:25,259
Did you ever catch your daughter in a lie?

613
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,728
I beg your pardon?

614
00:54:26,828 --> 00:54:29,230
Most children do lie occasionally.

615
00:54:29,430 --> 00:54:30,632
Not my daughter.

616
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:33,033
She's never told a lie in her life!

617
00:54:33,535 --> 00:54:36,537
I'm sorry. No further questions.

618
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:40,940
The prosecution calls Dr. Franz Urban.

619
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:44,746
And what did the laboratory
analysis show?

620
00:54:45,047 --> 00:54:48,449
It established derivation
from two different blood groups.

621
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,752
Would that mean
that only two different men were involved?

622
00:54:51,852 --> 00:54:55,155
It would not.
I merely said two blood groups.

623
00:54:55,456 --> 00:54:57,657
Many people have the same blood group.

624
00:54:57,959 --> 00:55:01,830
Tell me, would it be perfectly possible
that four men were involved?

625
00:55:02,229 --> 00:55:03,231
Perfectly.

626
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,633
Would the witness speak up?
We can't hear him.

627
00:55:05,733 --> 00:55:07,534
I said, "Perfectly."

628
00:55:08,235 --> 00:55:11,738
Did you notice any injuries
that pointed to a previous struggle?

629
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:12,940
I did.

630
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:16,444
The patient had a number
of bruises and contusions.

631
00:55:17,844 --> 00:55:20,647
Thank you, Doctor. No further questions.

632
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:23,849
Dr. Urban.

633
00:55:23,884 --> 00:55:27,954
You've testified that it's possible
that four men were involved.

634
00:55:28,155 --> 00:55:29,556
Am I correct in assuming...

635
00:55:29,657 --> 00:55:33,328
...that your tests cannot prove
the participation of more than two?

636
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,331
Yes. That is so.

637
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:41,335
Thank you. No further questions.

638
00:55:43,436 --> 00:55:46,438
The prosecution calls
witness Karin Steinhof.

639
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:51,043
Next witness, Miss Karin Steinhof, please.

640
00:56:22,642 --> 00:56:24,545
Raise your right hand.

641
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,247
Do you solemnly swear
the evidence you shall give...

642
00:56:27,282 --> 00:56:30,351
...shall be the truth and nothing but,
so help you God?

643
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,451
I do.

644
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:33,252
Please, be seated.

645
00:56:37,757 --> 00:56:41,727
...like in a horrible dream.
I couldn't move or make a sound.

646
00:56:42,228 --> 00:56:44,229
I just prayed he'd go away.

647
00:56:46,432 --> 00:56:50,236
All the time, he kept standing there,
looking down at me.

648
00:56:51,035 --> 00:56:52,537
Then he bent down.

649
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,140
I felt him cover me with something.

650
00:56:55,641 --> 00:56:57,942
Then he ran away after the others.

651
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:00,947
You said before, you stopped screaming...

652
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:03,649
...because you were afraid
these men might kill Frank.

653
00:57:03,749 --> 00:57:06,251
Yes. I heard him calling me.

654
00:57:06,652 --> 00:57:08,054
Then right after...

655
00:57:08,753 --> 00:57:10,857
...I heard fighting, and I didn't want...

656
00:57:10,892 --> 00:57:14,627
I understand. You're very fond
of Frank Borgmann, aren't you?

657
00:57:14,826 --> 00:57:16,027
Yes.

658
00:57:16,227 --> 00:57:19,132
Had you made any plans
for your future together?

659
00:57:20,432 --> 00:57:24,837
Sometimes we did talk
about getting married when we're older.

660
00:57:25,337 --> 00:57:29,542
You speak as if something has happened
to make you change your plans. Has it?

661
00:57:31,743 --> 00:57:33,645
Everything is different now.

662
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:36,648
Frank...he might feel ashamed of me.

663
00:57:38,149 --> 00:57:39,952
Tell me, Fraulein...

664
00:57:44,055 --> 00:57:45,456
That's all right.

665
00:57:45,656 --> 00:57:47,124
No further questions.

666
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:06,444
No questions.

667
00:58:06,743 --> 00:58:10,048
But I reserve right
to call witness back at another time.

668
00:58:10,147 --> 00:58:11,549
You're excused.

669
00:58:11,950 --> 00:58:13,251
Thank you.

670
00:58:21,925 --> 00:58:25,129
Since when hasn't the press
the right to interview prisoners?

671
00:58:25,229 --> 00:58:29,432
-The prosecution has no objection.
-The defense does have objections.

672
00:58:29,834 --> 00:58:32,437
Get the boys together for me, will you?

673
00:58:32,636 --> 00:58:35,239
-I'll take Larkin first.
-Yes, sir.

674
00:58:35,439 --> 00:58:38,142
-Don't forget the coffee.
-Yes, sir.

675
00:58:43,146 --> 00:58:46,650
Actually, for the purpose of my story,
you'll do, Major.

676
00:58:46,949 --> 00:58:50,153
Do you still think
you're going to beat the death sentence?

677
00:58:50,654 --> 00:58:53,122
-I think so.
-What makes you so sure?

678
00:58:53,624 --> 00:58:57,727
Three reasons:
first, because all witnesses lie a little.

679
00:58:58,428 --> 00:59:02,833
Second, because age hates youth,
and ugliness hates beauty.

680
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:06,536
But third,
because there's no way of measuring...

681
00:59:06,637 --> 00:59:09,438
...the incomparable nastiness
of the human mind.

682
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,143
If you'll excuse me, Miss Globus...
Miss Körner, I've got work to do.

683
00:59:14,244 --> 00:59:17,247
Maj. Garrett,
could you come quickly, please?

684
00:59:18,747 --> 00:59:21,551
I knew this guy belonged in a booby hatch.

685
00:59:27,124 --> 00:59:30,626
-Is he all right?
-He's more scared than he is hurt.

686
00:59:32,127 --> 00:59:34,130
Let's get him on the cot.

687
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:48,244
Here I am beating my brains out for you,
you try to sneak out the back door.

688
00:59:48,845 --> 00:59:51,748
I'm sorry. I promise I won't try it again.

689
00:59:52,146 --> 00:59:54,651
I promise you won't get the chance.

690
00:59:56,152 --> 00:59:58,154
Keep a 24-hour watch on him.

691
00:59:58,189 --> 00:59:59,655
Yes, sir.

692
01:00:10,833 --> 01:00:11,933
Hello, Trude.

693
01:00:12,035 --> 01:00:15,738
Here it is. Don't say where it came from
or Frieda will be out of a job.

694
01:00:15,773 --> 01:00:18,540
Good girl. I owe you a dinner for this.

695
01:00:19,141 --> 01:00:21,043
Are they really going to hang them?

696
01:00:21,242 --> 01:00:22,244
Maybe.

697
01:00:22,344 --> 01:00:23,845
Why don't you do something?

698
01:00:23,945 --> 01:00:26,449
-What do you suggest?
-Nail that Steinhof kid.

699
01:00:26,549 --> 01:00:28,749
You had her
and didn't ask her one question.

700
01:00:28,850 --> 01:00:31,753
An oversight.
I'll make up for that tomorrow.

701
01:00:31,853 --> 01:00:35,023
Just because her father's a banker,
that makes her a saint?

702
01:00:35,124 --> 01:00:36,325
What do you think?

703
01:00:36,425 --> 01:00:40,029
I know she isn't,
and right over there's the proof.

704
01:00:40,129 --> 01:00:41,430
<i>Frau Kulig.</i>

705
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:43,631
All the dirt you can use.

706
01:00:47,736 --> 01:00:49,638
Got to get back to work.

707
01:01:16,431 --> 01:01:19,533
<i>Frank was appalled
to find his mother a witness...</i>

708
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:23,236
<i>...even though she protested
she did it only in his interest.</i>

709
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:28,142
Dr. Riessmann, you're on the psychiatric
board of the army base hospital.

710
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:29,643
Not exactly.

711
01:01:29,843 --> 01:01:33,348
Occasionally, I'm called in
as a special consultant.

712
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:37,452
When was the first time that you...

713
01:01:38,252 --> 01:01:40,020
...examined Jim Larkin?

714
01:01:40,321 --> 01:01:41,522
Last June.

715
01:01:42,724 --> 01:01:46,427
What was his condition
when you examined him last June?

716
01:01:46,727 --> 01:01:49,731
He was subject
to sudden attacks of paralysis...

717
01:01:50,531 --> 01:01:54,234
...which couldn't be traced
to any organic disorder.

718
01:01:54,835 --> 01:01:57,839
After a series of sessions
with the patient...

719
01:01:58,039 --> 01:02:00,240
...I concluded that since puberty...

720
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,244
...he has suffered from
a severe inferiority neurosis.

721
01:02:04,443 --> 01:02:09,349
Nerve tests indicated
a state of chronic impotence.

722
01:02:09,549 --> 01:02:10,750
That's a lie!

723
01:02:10,951 --> 01:02:12,854
That's a lie, you lousy doctor!

724
01:02:13,054 --> 01:02:16,123
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're a quack-fink doctor!

725
01:02:16,158 --> 01:02:17,925
There's nothing wrong with me!

726
01:02:18,725 --> 01:02:21,128
Order, please! Order. Quiet!

727
01:02:21,163 --> 01:02:23,529
Pipe down, jerk. He's trying to help you.

728
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:26,134
Now, Doctor...

729
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:30,238
...will you tell the court
the last time you examined Jim Larkin?

730
01:02:30,938 --> 01:02:32,339
Five weeks ago.

731
01:02:32,939 --> 01:02:34,841
How did you find him at that time?

732
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:40,548
He was responding to psychotherapy.
Paralysis had largely disappeared.

733
01:02:40,648 --> 01:02:42,549
Reflexes were still sluggish.

734
01:02:42,848 --> 01:02:46,052
The neurosis was still rather severe.

735
01:02:46,253 --> 01:02:49,021
And the condition of impotence?

736
01:02:50,024 --> 01:02:51,625
Stop saying that!

737
01:02:51,724 --> 01:02:55,528
There's no condition of anything,
'cause there's nothing wrong with me...

738
01:02:55,628 --> 01:02:57,330
...you stinking doctor!

739
01:02:57,430 --> 01:03:00,233
Why do you keep lying?
There's nothing wrong with me!

740
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:02,936
You're lying because he told you to.

741
01:03:03,036 --> 01:03:05,938
You're a liar! Damn you!

742
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,242
You tell them it's a lie!

743
01:03:09,442 --> 01:03:11,543
You tell them it's just a lie, damn it!

744
01:03:11,743 --> 01:03:13,847
You're a liar, damn you!

745
01:03:14,046 --> 01:03:16,549
Damn you! You tell them it's a lie!

746
01:03:18,251 --> 01:03:20,419
May we have a brief recess?

747
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:23,722
-So ordered.
-Court is recessed for 30 minutes!

748
01:03:28,227 --> 01:03:30,229
Yes, I know the skiing cabin.

749
01:03:30,530 --> 01:03:33,933
Up to a year ago,
I used to go there myself with my son.

750
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:36,234
There are two small rooms.

751
01:03:36,335 --> 01:03:40,739
How do you know that Karin and your son
spent the weekend there together?

752
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:45,544
When I took his suit to the cleaner,
I found two ski lift tickets in his pocket.

753
01:03:45,645 --> 01:03:47,447
He tried to deny it at first...

754
01:03:47,547 --> 01:03:51,550
...but after we had a good talk together,
he finally admitted it.

755
01:03:52,351 --> 01:03:56,421
Why did you oppose your son's association
with Miss Steinhof?

756
01:03:56,522 --> 01:03:59,625
I did not want him
to be made a fool of by a teenager...

757
01:03:59,726 --> 01:04:02,227
...with nothing in her silly head
but to get married.

758
01:04:02,327 --> 01:04:06,430
These question and answers
are clearly and intentionally defamatory!

759
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:09,435
Whether the witness likes
or dislikes Fraulein Steinhof...

760
01:04:09,535 --> 01:04:12,938
...or welcomes or opposes her son's
association with Fraulein Steinhof...

761
01:04:13,138 --> 01:04:15,941
...or where Fraulein Steinhof
elects to spend her weekends...

762
01:04:15,976 --> 01:04:17,942
...is in no way pertinent to this case.

763
01:04:17,977 --> 01:04:22,949
We are here solely to determine
if the four accused are guilty of rape.

764
01:04:24,249 --> 01:04:27,218
Yesterday, Col. Pakenham rebutted
a similar objection of mine.

765
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:28,620
He said, and I quote:

766
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:33,324
"I am attempting to establish
the character of the prosecutrix."

767
01:04:33,424 --> 01:04:35,227
Today, I claim the same privilege.

768
01:04:35,326 --> 01:04:38,430
Let's not forget that four lives
depend on her testimony.

769
01:04:43,133 --> 01:04:44,536
Objection overruled.

770
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:52,343
What did your son say
when you reproached him...

771
01:04:52,443 --> 01:04:54,947
...for having spent the weekend
with Miss Steinhof?

772
01:04:55,046 --> 01:04:58,149
He begged me not to say anything
about it to Karin's parents.

773
01:04:58,250 --> 01:04:59,651
But why not?

774
01:04:59,752 --> 01:05:01,318
Because she had lied to them.

775
01:05:01,353 --> 01:05:04,922
She told them she was
spending the weekend with girlfriends.

776
01:05:06,223 --> 01:05:07,724
Thank you. That'll be all.

777
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:09,927
Herr Schmidt, what is your occupation?

778
01:05:10,027 --> 01:05:13,830
Head bookkeeper at Schnack and Pellman,
Ladies' Wear.

779
01:05:14,031 --> 01:05:17,836
-How long have you been employed there?
-34 years and three months.

780
01:05:18,134 --> 01:05:22,139
-Do you know the Steinhof family?
-Yes. We live in the same street.

781
01:05:22,339 --> 01:05:26,744
Is it true that you can see from your
living room into Karin Steinhof's bedroom?

782
01:05:26,945 --> 01:05:30,447
-That's correct.
-What's the distance approximately?

783
01:05:30,947 --> 01:05:33,217
50 meters, maybe less.

784
01:05:33,616 --> 01:05:34,918
Less.

785
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:38,222
Have you ever seen anything
from this window that seemed...

786
01:05:38,321 --> 01:05:39,522
...peculiar?

787
01:05:39,623 --> 01:05:41,724
Yes, most peculiar.

788
01:05:42,225 --> 01:05:43,627
Tell the court.

789
01:05:44,327 --> 01:05:47,531
Since last spring,
Fraulein Steinhof has the habit...

790
01:05:47,631 --> 01:05:50,733
...to exercise every morning
in front of the open window...

791
01:05:51,935 --> 01:05:53,337
...in the nude.

792
01:05:53,436 --> 01:05:54,938
Objection, Mr. Law Officer.

793
01:05:54,973 --> 01:05:59,442
It's totally irrelevant how, when, or where
Fraulein Steinhof chooses to exercise.

794
01:05:59,944 --> 01:06:01,645
Objection overruled.

795
01:06:02,445 --> 01:06:05,448
Did Fraulein Steinhof
in any way ever indicate to you...

796
01:06:05,548 --> 01:06:08,117
...that she was aware
of having a spectator?

797
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:09,620
She most certainly did.

798
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,422
Objection! This is merely
a conclusion by the witness.

799
01:06:12,521 --> 01:06:15,224
It is not,
as will become apparent immediately.

800
01:06:15,324 --> 01:06:16,726
Objection overruled.

801
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:21,231
Herr Schmidt, describe the events
of a certain morning...

802
01:06:21,332 --> 01:06:24,234
...when Karin Steinhof was aware
of being watched.

803
01:06:25,035 --> 01:06:27,837
She was again
standing before the window...

804
01:06:27,938 --> 01:06:31,541
...when she turned around
and she saw me looking at her...

805
01:06:31,741 --> 01:06:34,643
-...and she had the frechheit...
-"Impertinence."

806
01:06:35,245 --> 01:06:37,046
To...

807
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:39,916
I don't know how to say it in English.

808
01:06:40,116 --> 01:06:41,517
Say it in German.

809
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:44,620
She made...

810
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,623
We call it 'eine lange nase'. Like that.

811
01:06:51,427 --> 01:06:55,430
Let the record reflect that the witness
made a nose-thumbing gesture.

812
01:06:58,535 --> 01:07:00,536
Thank you. No further questions.

813
01:07:01,837 --> 01:07:05,841
Did you ever draw the Steinhofs' attention
to their daughter's behavior?

814
01:07:05,876 --> 01:07:08,243
Why should I? We do not meet socially.

815
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:09,846
Even though you're neighbors?

816
01:07:09,945 --> 01:07:12,148
The house I live in belongs to the bank.

817
01:07:12,248 --> 01:07:14,717
In business, Herr Steinhof
can be most unfriendly.

818
01:07:15,516 --> 01:07:18,019
Then you're not on good terms
with the Steinhofs?

819
01:07:18,221 --> 01:07:20,221
You may put it that way.

820
01:07:20,623 --> 01:07:22,624
Thank you. No further questions.

821
01:07:26,628 --> 01:07:30,031
Is your dislike
of the Steinhof family so strong...

822
01:07:30,332 --> 01:07:33,034
...that here, under oath,
you'd give false testimony?

823
01:07:33,134 --> 01:07:34,135
What?

824
01:07:35,537 --> 01:07:36,638
Never!

825
01:07:36,739 --> 01:07:38,839
Thank you. No further questions.

826
01:07:43,645 --> 01:07:45,047
Thank you.

827
01:07:45,447 --> 01:07:48,917
You told us yesterday afternoon
that you let Karin swim back alone...

828
01:07:48,952 --> 01:07:51,319
...so she'd have time to get dressed.

829
01:07:51,421 --> 01:07:53,021
Think it over, Frank.

830
01:07:53,221 --> 01:07:55,323
Could there have been another reason?

831
01:07:55,523 --> 01:07:56,625
Another reason?

832
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,125
No.

833
01:07:59,027 --> 01:08:00,929
Are you quite sure there wasn't?

834
01:08:01,030 --> 01:08:02,529
I don't know what you mean.

835
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:05,634
For example, you could have had a quarrel.

836
01:08:05,834 --> 01:08:07,135
Did you?

837
01:08:08,336 --> 01:08:10,238
It was getting dark, and...

838
01:08:10,338 --> 01:08:12,540
That's not what I asked you.

839
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,342
I don't remember.

840
01:08:16,844 --> 01:08:19,648
You can't remember
whether you quarreled.

841
01:08:19,814 --> 01:08:23,016
Could your memory
of other events be equally imperfect?

842
01:08:23,117 --> 01:08:26,721
Her screams, for example,
your fight and all the rest?

843
01:08:26,921 --> 01:08:28,423
I remember that perfectly.

844
01:08:28,458 --> 01:08:30,425
Please remember you're under oath...

845
01:08:30,524 --> 01:08:35,028
...and I want to know, did you or did you
not quarrel with Karin Steinhof?

846
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:37,331
We had no quarrel.

847
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,534
Witness dismissed.
Will Frau Kulig take the stand?

848
01:08:52,447 --> 01:08:55,116
Kind of scraping the bottom
of the barrel, isn't he?

849
01:08:55,716 --> 01:08:58,218
Bottom of the sewer, if you ask me.

850
01:09:03,023 --> 01:09:04,726
Will you raise your right hand?

851
01:09:04,825 --> 01:09:07,027
Do you solemnly swear
the evidence you give...

852
01:09:07,127 --> 01:09:09,630
...will be the whole
truth, and nothing but?

853
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:11,732
-I do.
-Please, be seated.

854
01:09:12,533 --> 01:09:14,834
Will you state your name and occupation?

855
01:09:15,035 --> 01:09:18,237
-Berta Kulig, widow.
-Do you know Karin Steinhof?

856
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,841
Yes, her I know.

857
01:09:21,441 --> 01:09:23,443
When and where did you see her last?

858
01:09:23,642 --> 01:09:26,613
On September 5, late in the afternoon...

859
01:09:26,713 --> 01:09:29,216
...on the riverbank near the dam.

860
01:09:29,417 --> 01:09:30,818
Was she alone?

861
01:09:30,918 --> 01:09:32,819
That's just it. No!

862
01:09:33,619 --> 01:09:35,523
She was with the Borgmann boy.

863
01:09:36,222 --> 01:09:38,324
What were the two of them wearing?

864
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:41,828
-He had a black 'badehose' on.
-"Swimming trunks."

865
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:45,331
And she had on
a blue bikini with white spots.

866
01:09:45,366 --> 01:09:49,135
Would you describe
to the court this bikini more exactly?

867
01:09:49,536 --> 01:09:51,237
There isn't much to describe.

868
01:09:51,336 --> 01:09:55,342
A few little spots on top and downstairs,
not much more.

869
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,546
What were the two of them doing there?

870
01:10:01,315 --> 01:10:03,917
-They were necking.
-You mean they were kissing?

871
01:10:04,116 --> 01:10:06,119
Yes, but the real thing...

872
01:10:06,317 --> 01:10:08,520
...not the way you kiss your mother.

873
01:10:10,824 --> 01:10:12,325
Did their bodies touch?

874
01:10:13,827 --> 01:10:18,131
First, he was half on top of her,
and then it was the other way around.

875
01:10:20,432 --> 01:10:22,434
Did you hear what was said?

876
01:10:22,535 --> 01:10:24,136
Yes, everything.

877
01:10:24,171 --> 01:10:25,738
"Kiss me," she said.

878
01:10:25,838 --> 01:10:28,640
I don't know how many times, "Kiss me."

879
01:10:28,675 --> 01:10:31,243
I thought you said
he had already kissed her.

880
01:10:31,343 --> 01:10:35,715
Yes, but not the way she wanted.
That's what made her so upset.

881
01:10:35,915 --> 01:10:39,719
That's why she called him
a 'mutter söhnchen'.

882
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,621
-What's that?
-"A mama's boy."

883
01:10:43,656 --> 01:10:45,123
Then she yelled to him...

884
01:10:45,158 --> 01:10:47,826
...that his mother
was coming between them...

885
01:10:47,926 --> 01:10:51,730
...and when he absolutely didn't want to do
what she wanted...

886
01:10:51,931 --> 01:10:55,333
Stop! Are we going to elevate
gutter gossip to the status of evidence?

887
01:10:55,634 --> 01:10:56,935
"What she wanted!"

888
01:10:57,034 --> 01:11:00,138
The witness hasn't said one word
to prove that Fraulein Steinhof...

889
01:11:00,173 --> 01:11:01,840
...had anything indecent in mind.

890
01:11:01,939 --> 01:11:03,542
You should have been there!

891
01:11:03,641 --> 01:11:06,145
-Quiet!
-You should have been there!

892
01:11:08,012 --> 01:11:10,915
Silence, or I'll have
the courtroom cleared!

893
01:11:12,717 --> 01:11:17,222
I must admonish the witness to testify
only to things she actually saw or heard.

894
01:11:17,321 --> 01:11:20,124
All sentences including
and after the one objected to...

895
01:11:20,224 --> 01:11:22,327
...will be stricken from the record.

896
01:11:22,362 --> 01:11:23,928
What did you see or hear...

897
01:11:24,029 --> 01:11:27,132
...that would show what Karin
wanted from Frank?

898
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,334
I don't know what to do here.

899
01:11:29,433 --> 01:11:32,937
Speak, not speak.
Everything is striked out.

900
01:11:33,139 --> 01:11:36,241
-"Objection."
-Now, Frau Kulig. Bitte?

901
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:40,310
All right.

902
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:42,413
Then the boy said:

903
01:11:42,914 --> 01:11:45,317
"Nobody can come between us."

904
01:11:45,716 --> 01:11:49,220
And she 'zitterte' all over.

905
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,022
She trembled.

906
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:52,924
And then she said:

907
01:11:53,123 --> 01:11:54,825
"Prove it to me."

908
01:11:56,427 --> 01:11:58,630
She looked up to him.

909
01:12:13,711 --> 01:12:16,212
I don't like it, Major, not at all.

910
01:12:16,813 --> 01:12:19,617
-The girl should have recovered long ago.
-What can you do?

911
01:12:19,718 --> 01:12:23,620
Every time something like this happens,
she slips right back again.

912
01:12:27,624 --> 01:12:29,427
I wouldn't. Not now.

913
01:12:30,527 --> 01:12:32,028
Is something wrong?

914
01:12:32,129 --> 01:12:34,530
Yes. She's received
another anonymous letter.

915
01:12:34,565 --> 01:12:35,733
No.

916
01:12:36,033 --> 01:12:37,534
What this time?

917
01:12:37,934 --> 01:12:41,839
It's about your mother's testimony
and what this Kulig woman said.

918
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:46,609
What makes people do things like this?

919
01:12:46,910 --> 01:12:51,313
Yes, such a small town
and so much hate and meanness.

920
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:11,835
<i>That afternoon,
Herr Steinhof had lost his starch...</i>

921
01:13:12,034 --> 01:13:16,039
<i>And his pride.
He was a stranger in his own house.</i>

922
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,319
<i>She hated to leave him like this...</i>

923
01:13:30,421 --> 01:13:33,822
<i>...but an uneasy feeling
about Karin nagged at her...</i>

924
01:13:34,424 --> 01:13:36,426
<i>...drew her to the hospital.</i>

925
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:59,115
<i>- She wanted to be home.
-Is Papa here?</i>

926
01:14:09,926 --> 01:14:11,526
<i>"A lovely daughter."</i>

927
01:14:59,707 --> 01:15:02,911
I know you don't want to speak to me,
but you should.

928
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:04,612
Really, you should.

929
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:15,624
How dare you come to my house.

930
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:18,225
I want to talk to you about Karin.

931
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,531
Have you no shame, no decency?

932
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:28,336
No, I guess not.
You don't know the meaning of shame.

933
01:15:30,237 --> 01:15:34,008
I ask you for the last time,
withdraw her from this trial.

934
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:38,613
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

935
01:15:38,712 --> 01:15:41,214
Pull her out of this mess
while you still have time.

936
01:15:41,316 --> 01:15:44,317
You tried everything
to make her a liar and a tramp...

937
01:15:44,418 --> 01:15:47,521
...in front of the town,
and now you want her to run away...

938
01:15:47,622 --> 01:15:49,923
...so that everyone is sure to believe it!

939
01:15:50,023 --> 01:15:52,126
Listen for just one minute.

940
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:57,631
No German can be forced to appear
as a witness in an American court-martial.

941
01:15:57,731 --> 01:16:00,534
-Only you can force her.
-I don't have to.

942
01:16:00,634 --> 01:16:03,236
My daughter knows what she has to do.

943
01:16:03,336 --> 01:16:06,707
Don't let her.
You'll never forgive yourself if you do.

944
01:16:07,007 --> 01:16:08,909
Are you threatening me?

945
01:16:09,110 --> 01:16:13,714
-I'm not threatening, I'm begging you.
-I'll go to your General. I'll report you!

946
01:16:13,815 --> 01:16:16,516
Do anything you want, but understand me.

947
01:16:16,716 --> 01:16:20,320
If she was my daughter, I'd leave town
before I'd let her appear tomorrow.

948
01:16:20,419 --> 01:16:23,523
Leave my town? What do you think I am?

949
01:16:23,623 --> 01:16:27,226
An American who has no town,
who's always building new towns...

950
01:16:27,327 --> 01:16:30,031
...who has no feeling
for the place where he was born?

951
01:16:30,066 --> 01:16:32,932
Isn't your daughter more important
than a pile of stones?

952
01:16:32,967 --> 01:16:35,135
That pile of stones...

953
01:16:35,534 --> 01:16:39,706
...is where my grandfathers were born
and buried before your America existed!

954
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:43,409
-What's that to do with your daughter?
-How can a man like you understand?

955
01:16:43,510 --> 01:16:46,111
You spring from nothing.
You come from nowhere!

956
01:16:46,212 --> 01:16:49,014
I will not let you drive me from my town!

957
01:16:51,517 --> 01:16:55,221
You know, Herr Steinhof,
I was born in an American town...

958
01:16:55,321 --> 01:16:59,225
...that was founded 134 years
before Germany became a nation.

959
01:16:59,725 --> 01:17:01,426
I'm very fond of my town, too.

960
01:17:01,526 --> 01:17:04,131
I'd leave it and never look back
if I had a daughter...

961
01:17:04,230 --> 01:17:08,835
But Karin is my daughter!
She'll do what I say! I'll fight you!

962
01:17:09,034 --> 01:17:12,338
But you won't fight me! Karin will,
and she's not strong enough!

963
01:17:12,438 --> 01:17:14,307
Get out of my house.

964
01:17:18,210 --> 01:17:20,212
All right, Herr Steinhof.

965
01:17:22,115 --> 01:17:23,716
But just remember.

966
01:17:24,617 --> 01:17:27,618
With or without Karin,
those four boys will not hang.

967
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:32,625
There can be no death sentence
unless I've cross-examined Karin in full...

968
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:35,728
...and until she's been dismissed by me.

969
01:17:36,628 --> 01:17:39,031
-She won't be able to stand it.
-Damn you!

970
01:17:39,132 --> 01:17:41,933
I'm a good lawyer. I know my business.

971
01:17:42,034 --> 01:17:44,436
I'll make sure she won't
be able to stand it.

972
01:17:44,837 --> 01:17:47,105
-Get out of my house!
-Papa!

973
01:17:52,009 --> 01:17:55,814
What kind of way is this
to run around in front of strangers?

974
01:18:17,135 --> 01:18:19,137
It's late, Major Garrett.

975
01:18:19,537 --> 01:18:21,406
Please leave us alone.

976
01:18:52,735 --> 01:18:55,706
You know, there's another
great German lawyer:

977
01:18:56,808 --> 01:18:58,709
Rudolf von Jhering.

978
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:03,613
He said, "The defense of man's rights...

979
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:07,117
"...is the poetry of law."

980
01:19:07,217 --> 01:19:10,922
"The defense of man's rights..."
I don't know, something like that.

981
01:19:11,021 --> 01:19:14,625
-Do you remember how it goes?
-I don't even know the gentleman.

982
01:19:18,929 --> 01:19:21,431
I hate to misquote a fella like that.

983
01:19:22,533 --> 01:19:24,535
Anyway, he's dead.

984
01:19:26,704 --> 01:19:30,807
But dead or alive,
a man's got a right to be quoted correctly.

985
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:34,110
Getting loaded?

986
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:37,915
Miss Globus.

987
01:19:39,015 --> 01:19:41,317
Come in. Sit down. Have a drink.

988
01:19:42,318 --> 01:19:43,520
Thanks.

989
01:19:44,621 --> 01:19:46,422
I'll have one, too.

990
01:19:51,429 --> 01:19:55,532
The ugly made a fine case
against the beautiful today, didn't they?

991
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,534
They generally do.

992
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,104
Make a lot better case tomorrow, though.

993
01:20:02,705 --> 01:20:04,407
If Karin shows up.

994
01:20:04,506 --> 01:20:06,308
Why don't you stop it?

995
01:20:07,510 --> 01:20:08,812
No can do.

996
01:20:10,312 --> 01:20:12,315
The law's like a river.

997
01:20:12,715 --> 01:20:16,019
A great big, wide, deep river.

998
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:20,222
Once you jump in, the current grabs you...

999
01:20:20,623 --> 01:20:22,725
...and there's no way to stop.

1000
01:20:23,526 --> 01:20:27,329
That old river of the law
carries everything along with it:

1001
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:31,234
Boats, barges, scows, people, sewage.

1002
01:20:31,534 --> 01:20:35,204
That sure was a lovely pair
you put on the stand today.

1003
01:20:35,604 --> 01:20:40,309
-This Herr Schmidt, I could...
-Don't be too tough on the poor old devil.

1004
01:20:43,913 --> 01:20:48,716
I'll bet you 10-to-1 he never had the guts
to touch a woman in his whole life.

1005
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:53,822
Maybe it would've been different if just
once some pretty girl had blown a kiss...

1006
01:20:54,123 --> 01:20:56,825
...instead of thumbing her nose at him.

1007
01:20:58,727 --> 01:21:02,630
Then one morning,
Karin stood in front of that window.

1008
01:21:03,432 --> 01:21:05,133
He saw her there.

1009
01:21:06,234 --> 01:21:07,802
He saw beauty.

1010
01:21:09,105 --> 01:21:13,208
The one dazzling moment of beauty
in his whole life.

1011
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:16,912
It was out of reach.

1012
01:21:20,115 --> 01:21:21,516
Poor Schmidt.

1013
01:21:22,917 --> 01:21:24,320
Poor Karin.

1014
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,421
Poor everybody.

1015
01:21:28,223 --> 01:21:30,125
You just broke my heart.

1016
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:34,128
You ought to be a poet.
I'll quote you in my piece.

1017
01:21:34,729 --> 01:21:36,531
You just do that.

1018
01:21:37,932 --> 01:21:40,902
While you're at it, give
them a little advice.

1019
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:44,105
Tell them never to get into a lawsuit.

1020
01:21:45,006 --> 01:21:46,207
Never.

1021
01:21:47,409 --> 01:21:49,211
No matter who they are.

1022
01:21:50,512 --> 01:21:53,014
No matter how good a case they've got.

1023
01:21:53,314 --> 01:21:55,418
No matter how virtuously they live.

1024
01:21:55,453 --> 01:21:57,419
Never get into a lawsuit.

1025
01:21:58,218 --> 01:22:00,020
<i>Hasta la vista.</i>

1026
01:22:00,420 --> 01:22:02,023
<i>Auf Wiedersehen.</i>

1027
01:22:02,122 --> 01:22:04,825
<i>Bonsoir. Good night.</i>

1028
01:22:06,427 --> 01:22:09,530
Just never get into a lawsuit, that's all.

1029
01:22:45,433 --> 01:22:48,602
You won't have to be sworn again.
You're still under oath.

1030
01:22:48,702 --> 01:22:50,704
-Thank you.
-Your witness.

1031
01:23:04,217 --> 01:23:06,820
-Are you feeling better today?
-Yes.

1032
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:10,724
Don't be nervous. Just feel at ease.
I'll make it as short as possible.

1033
01:23:10,759 --> 01:23:11,825
Thank you.

1034
01:23:11,924 --> 01:23:13,225
One thing first.

1035
01:23:16,328 --> 01:23:19,531
I ask that this be marked
as defense Exhibit "E".

1036
01:23:25,704 --> 01:23:27,507
May it be so marked?

1037
01:23:27,707 --> 01:23:29,009
So ordered.

1038
01:23:32,712 --> 01:23:35,715
Will you tell the court
if this is the bikini you wore...

1039
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:38,418
...on the afternoon of September 5?

1040
01:23:39,019 --> 01:23:40,520
Yes, that's it.

1041
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:44,123
I offer this evidence
as defense Exhibit "E".

1042
01:23:47,926 --> 01:23:51,830
How did your parents feel about
you going out with Frank Borgmann?

1043
01:23:52,532 --> 01:23:56,101
They didn't like it.
My father said we were too young.

1044
01:23:56,702 --> 01:23:59,064
Did your parents'
attitude make it difficult

1045
01:23:59,065 --> 01:24:01,006
for you and Frank to see each other?

1046
01:24:01,407 --> 01:24:02,407
Yes.

1047
01:24:03,009 --> 01:24:05,011
But you did manage somehow.

1048
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:06,611
-Yes.
-How?

1049
01:24:06,912 --> 01:24:11,417
I didn't always say
exactly where I was going.

1050
01:24:11,817 --> 01:24:14,820
I see, like the time
you went skiing with Frank?

1051
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:19,625
It was testified that you spent
a weekend with him at a ski cabin.

1052
01:24:22,026 --> 01:24:24,228
Your father didn't know about that, did he?

1053
01:24:25,531 --> 01:24:28,000
He didn't know Frank was along.

1054
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:31,704
Let's go back for a moment.

1055
01:24:31,803 --> 01:24:36,108
A witness at this trial, your neighbor,
Herr Schmidt, testified that you:

1056
01:24:36,208 --> 01:24:38,611
"Exercise in front
of the window in the nude."

1057
01:24:38,646 --> 01:24:41,413
When you saw him watching,
you thumbed your nose at him.

1058
01:24:41,513 --> 01:24:45,116
-That nasty old man!
-Did you tell your parents about it?

1059
01:24:45,818 --> 01:24:47,318
No, I didn't.

1060
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,121
But why not?

1061
01:24:49,922 --> 01:24:53,525
I didn't want my father to know
I forgot to pull the curtains.

1062
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:55,727
And sometimes I'm careless.

1063
01:24:55,927 --> 01:24:57,829
He's very strict about those things.

1064
01:24:59,697 --> 01:25:02,800
There's testimony that when
you and Frank were by the river...

1065
01:25:02,835 --> 01:25:05,804
...you held each other and you kissed.
Is that right?

1066
01:25:05,904 --> 01:25:07,004
Yes.

1067
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:11,007
It was also stated you left abruptly.
You had a quarrel?

1068
01:25:11,107 --> 01:25:13,310
No, not a quarrel. It was...

1069
01:25:13,711 --> 01:25:15,813
Just a few cross words? A spat?

1070
01:25:16,614 --> 01:25:18,016
Yes, that's it.

1071
01:25:18,216 --> 01:25:21,219
Then you called him a mama's boy,
and swam across the river?

1072
01:25:21,618 --> 01:25:22,621
Yes.

1073
01:25:23,421 --> 01:25:26,825
When you got back to where you'd left
your clothes, what did you do?

1074
01:25:28,026 --> 01:25:30,327
I lit a cigarette
and stood there for a minute.

1075
01:25:30,528 --> 01:25:34,199
While you were standing there, these four
men came and dragged you away.

1076
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:35,399
Yes.

1077
01:25:35,999 --> 01:25:40,505
Then, as you previously testified,
your bikini was ripped off of you?

1078
01:25:42,906 --> 01:25:45,009
Is that how it happened?

1079
01:25:45,610 --> 01:25:46,711
Yes.

1080
01:25:47,411 --> 01:25:49,213
Then you were raped.

1081
01:25:52,717 --> 01:25:55,619
Describe to the court
what happened after...

1082
01:25:56,520 --> 01:25:57,921
No, never mind.

1083
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:02,025
You've already testified to this
in direct examination by Col. Pakenham.

1084
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:05,729
No use rehashing
all the embarrassing details.

1085
01:26:10,601 --> 01:26:14,204
Fraulein Steinhof, I show you
Exhibit "C" for the prosecution...

1086
01:26:14,304 --> 01:26:18,709
...the shirt worn on the afternoon
of the crime by defendant Snyder.

1087
01:26:18,909 --> 01:26:21,512
You'll observe
that it's ripped in several places.

1088
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:24,213
Were those rips and tears made by you?

1089
01:26:25,215 --> 01:26:29,219
I don't know for sure. Maybe they were.
I was trying to fight him off.

1090
01:26:29,419 --> 01:26:31,522
Exactly. You were struggling.

1091
01:26:33,723 --> 01:26:38,528
Defendant Snyder looks strong, yet you
inflicted considerable damage on his shirt.

1092
01:26:38,563 --> 01:26:41,498
Do you find any rips or tears
in either of these garments?

1093
01:26:43,199 --> 01:26:44,500
No.

1094
01:26:45,101 --> 01:26:49,305
Since you were struggling, it follows
that he was also struggling with you.

1095
01:26:49,505 --> 01:26:52,608
One tug from a strong man
should rip that bikini to bits, right?

1096
01:26:52,809 --> 01:26:54,011
Objection!

1097
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:57,013
Witness is not obliged to answer
to counsel's conjecture.

1098
01:26:57,213 --> 01:26:58,815
Withdraw the question.

1099
01:26:58,915 --> 01:27:00,117
May I?

1100
01:27:01,117 --> 01:27:03,420
This bikini looks pretty flimsy.

1101
01:27:04,821 --> 01:27:07,122
One strong tug should rip it to shreds.

1102
01:27:11,928 --> 01:27:14,597
Did Sgt. Snyder tear them off...

1103
01:27:16,098 --> 01:27:18,301
...or did you let him take them off?

1104
01:27:19,301 --> 01:27:21,003
Answer the question.

1105
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,806
I didn't let him do anything!

1106
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:28,209
I didn't even have them on.

1107
01:27:30,313 --> 01:27:33,016
I took them off so I could get dressed!

1108
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:45,727
So you were naked the first time
you saw these four men?

1109
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:49,597
Just as you were naked when
Herr Schmidt looked out the window.

1110
01:27:49,698 --> 01:27:52,401
<i>-That was different...
- Herr Schmidt saw you naked?</i>

1111
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:55,504
-It was in my own...
-And Frank? He's the one you love.

1112
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:58,806
-Did he see you naked the weekend skiing?
-No, the girls slept...

1113
01:27:58,907 --> 01:28:01,910
Answer the question!
Did Frank see you naked?

1114
01:28:01,945 --> 01:28:02,812
No!

1115
01:28:02,912 --> 01:28:05,714
You lied about your nakedness
in front of these four men?

1116
01:28:05,749 --> 01:28:07,216
Only because I was ashamed!

1117
01:28:07,316 --> 01:28:08,717
-Yes or no?
-Yes!

1118
01:28:08,818 --> 01:28:10,819
You lied to your father? Yes or no?

1119
01:28:10,919 --> 01:28:13,822
Are you lying now
when you say Frank didn't see you naked?

1120
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,322
-Objection!
-Withdrawn.

1121
01:28:15,357 --> 01:28:17,425
Has Frank Borgmann ever seen you naked?

1122
01:28:17,460 --> 01:28:18,425
No, never!

1123
01:28:18,525 --> 01:28:21,096
You've testified
that you were standing by the river...

1124
01:28:21,196 --> 01:28:24,199
...naked, as we now discover,
and you were looking at him.

1125
01:28:24,398 --> 01:28:27,502
If he were looking at you,
could he have seen you? Yes or no?

1126
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:29,103
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

1127
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:32,206
If you could see him,
he could see you, and you were naked.

1128
01:28:32,241 --> 01:28:33,508
You say it like it was dirty...

1129
01:28:33,608 --> 01:28:36,012
Will witness confine
her remarks to yes or no?

1130
01:28:36,111 --> 01:28:39,614
-Did Frank Borgmann see you naked?
-I don't know.

1131
01:28:39,713 --> 01:28:42,916
Then you cannot swear that he has
never seen you naked, can you?

1132
01:28:43,017 --> 01:28:44,518
-But you did swear?
-Yes.

1133
01:28:44,617 --> 01:28:47,522
You took off your clothes and stood there
so he would look.

1134
01:28:47,557 --> 01:28:48,723
No!

1135
01:28:49,624 --> 01:28:52,626
This is incredible!
He's putting words in the witness' mouth!

1136
01:28:52,726 --> 01:28:54,595
I'm trying to get the truth from her!

1137
01:28:54,695 --> 01:28:57,299
I'm won't see four men hanged
on a rope of lies.

1138
01:28:57,334 --> 01:28:59,500
That's what we have here, straight lies.

1139
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,402
Objection overruled. Proceed.

1140
01:29:01,802 --> 01:29:03,503
All right.

1141
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:05,705
We've established that five men...

1142
01:29:05,806 --> 01:29:09,209
...possibly six, have seen
Fraulein Steinhof naked.

1143
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:18,017
Does it give you pleasure
to expose your body to men?

1144
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:20,722
No!

1145
01:29:20,757 --> 01:29:22,924
You did strip in full view of Frank...

1146
01:29:22,959 --> 01:29:25,825
...with a deliberate intention
of exciting him, didn't you?

1147
01:29:25,926 --> 01:29:26,695
No!

1148
01:29:26,730 --> 01:29:28,795
For whose excitement
did you stand naked?

1149
01:29:28,895 --> 01:29:30,798
Was it perhaps for these four men?

1150
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:33,399
I didn't know they were there!

1151
01:29:33,499 --> 01:29:36,703
When you did see them, what did you do,
thumb your nose at them?

1152
01:29:36,803 --> 01:29:39,304
I can't!

1153
01:29:39,806 --> 01:29:43,210
-I don't know anything anymore.
-Let me help you remember.

1154
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:46,713
Frank was a mama's boy, so you left him.
You were alone and naked.

1155
01:29:46,813 --> 01:29:51,219
You still wanted a man's arms around you.
You still wanted the kisses Frank refused.

1156
01:29:51,419 --> 01:29:53,920
Suddenly, standing beside you was a man,
any man.

1157
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:58,024
The man you were waiting for.
Scott! Larkin! Snyder! Haines!

1158
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:01,794
-No. Don't say those things!
-Objection! I protest.

1159
01:30:01,895 --> 01:30:04,397
This is no cross-examination,
this is a circus!

1160
01:30:04,497 --> 01:30:07,400
I move the defense counsel
be reprimanded...

1161
01:30:38,397 --> 01:30:40,099
Quiet, please. Quiet.

1162
01:30:40,398 --> 01:30:43,002
<i>And so, on October 13...</i>

1163
01:30:43,301 --> 01:30:46,205
<i>...the hearing of the witnesses
came to an end.</i>

1164
01:30:46,604 --> 01:30:50,109
<i>Herr Steinhof withdrew his daughter
from the trial.</i>

1165
01:31:13,698 --> 01:31:15,401
You were terrific!

1166
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:44,295
I'll kill you!

1167
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:49,400
You want to kill me?
Then what are you doing with this?

1168
01:31:50,702 --> 01:31:54,407
If you really want to kill somebody,
then take a gun or a knife.

1169
01:31:59,511 --> 01:32:02,013
Don't try to prove you're a man to me.

1170
01:32:02,213 --> 01:32:04,114
Prove it to the girl.

1171
01:32:04,215 --> 01:32:06,517
Don't you realize she loves you?

1172
01:32:07,619 --> 01:32:11,022
Take her and get out of this town
as fast as possible.

1173
01:32:12,323 --> 01:32:14,091
And never come back.

1174
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:28,105
<i>Quarrels and ugly scenes had become
a daily custom in the Steinhof household...</i>

1175
01:32:28,606 --> 01:32:31,708
<i>...and always Karin knew
she was the cause.</i>

1176
01:33:11,114 --> 01:33:13,818
<i>Would nothing ever be normal again?</i>

1177
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:16,820
<i>Now Frank's mother was here
looking for him.</i>

1178
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,890
<i>Forged her signature
on a check and disappeared.</i>

1179
01:33:19,925 --> 01:33:24,094
<i>Probably had it in his silly head
to run off with their sex- mad brat.</i>

1180
01:33:24,495 --> 01:33:27,698
<i>If they didn't prevent it,
maybe the police would.</i>

1181
01:33:50,420 --> 01:33:52,221
<i>"Your mother's here."</i>

1182
01:33:54,590 --> 01:33:56,792
<i>"I'll wait at the lumberyard."</i>

1183
01:34:31,092 --> 01:34:32,895
What's the hurry, Karin?

1184
01:34:33,694 --> 01:34:35,697
Going swimming, Karin?

1185
01:35:09,898 --> 01:35:12,601
<i>Karin begged him to go home, forget her.</i>

1186
01:35:13,101 --> 01:35:16,505
<i>They couldn't possibly run away
with this hanging over them.</i>

1187
01:35:16,604 --> 01:35:18,305
<i>But Frank's mind was set.</i>

1188
01:35:21,409 --> 01:35:25,613
<i>It was his money, anyway,
from his father for his 21st birthday.</i>

1189
01:35:26,014 --> 01:35:27,915
<i>He'd work, pay it back.</i>

1190
01:35:28,416 --> 01:35:30,519
<i>Or didn't she trust him?</i>

1191
01:37:46,887 --> 01:37:49,388
<i>Frau Borgmann made good her threat.</i>

1192
01:37:50,488 --> 01:37:54,293
<i>She had proffered a charge of forgery
against her son.</i>

1193
01:38:32,196 --> 01:38:35,500
Sgt. Charles P. Snyder,
it is my duty as president of this court...

1194
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,303
...to inform you that the court sentences
you to dishonorable discharge...

1195
01:38:39,404 --> 01:38:42,406
...and to be confined
at hard labor for 25 years.

1196
01:38:42,606 --> 01:38:45,911
Cpl. Birdwell Scott,
it is my duty as president of this court...

1197
01:38:46,011 --> 01:38:49,713
...to inform you that the court sentences
you to dishonorable discharge...

1198
01:38:49,814 --> 01:38:52,416
...and to be confined
at hard labor for 16 years.

1199
01:38:52,817 --> 01:38:55,886
Cpl. James Larkin,
it is my duty as president of this court...

1200
01:38:55,987 --> 01:38:59,892
...to inform you that the court sentences
you to dishonorable discharge...

1201
01:39:00,092 --> 01:39:02,493
...and to be confined
at hard labor for six years.

1202
01:39:02,593 --> 01:39:05,896
<i>-Priv. Joseph E. Haines...
- ...and Haines was the last of the four.</i>

1203
01:39:05,997 --> 01:39:09,401
<i>Just as calmly as the others,
he stood and heard himself sentenced...</i>

1204
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:12,704
<i>...to 20 years at hard labor
and dishonorable discharge.</i>

1205
01:39:12,803 --> 01:39:14,305
<i>Garrett, the legal lion...</i>

1206
01:39:14,405 --> 01:39:17,608
<i>...who'd battled the death sentence
so fiercely was at their side.</i>

1207
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,210
<i>He seemed a tamed,
almost an indifferent lion...</i>

1208
01:39:20,311 --> 01:39:22,813
<i>...now that the fight
for their lives had been won.</i>

1209
01:39:22,913 --> 01:39:25,416
<i>Judging from the handful
of spectators present...</i>

1210
01:39:25,515 --> 01:39:28,486
<i>...there was a falling off of interest
in the proceedings.</i>

1211
01:39:28,521 --> 01:39:31,989
<i>A few grumbles were heard about
the relatively lenient sentence...</i>

1212
01:39:32,089 --> 01:39:33,792
<i>...Cpl. Scott's brilliant...</i>

1213
01:39:33,890 --> 01:39:35,392
May I come in?

1214
01:39:35,493 --> 01:39:37,995
<i>-Why not?
- ...the sentencing was fair.</i>

1215
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:47,404
How did your men react
to being spared the death penalty?

1216
01:39:48,406 --> 01:39:50,707
-You weren't there either?
-No.

1217
01:39:51,809 --> 01:39:55,611
Three straight days, we had a hit show,
standing room only.

1218
01:39:55,812 --> 01:39:57,915
This afternoon, we were a flop.

1219
01:39:58,015 --> 01:40:00,183
No girl to be stripped in public.

1220
01:40:01,185 --> 01:40:05,289
No chance to see the light go out
of men's eyes when death is pronounced.

1221
01:40:05,389 --> 01:40:07,991
No sex, no death. Where's the fun?

1222
01:40:08,793 --> 01:40:10,894
You and the town stayed home.

1223
01:40:11,995 --> 01:40:14,798
I was trying to line up a story on Karin.

1224
01:40:14,997 --> 01:40:17,100
I hope you got a beauty.

1225
01:40:18,001 --> 01:40:19,203
I did.

1226
01:40:20,303 --> 01:40:21,605
She's dead.

1227
01:40:27,610 --> 01:40:28,711
How?

1228
01:40:29,211 --> 01:40:30,512
Suicide.

1229
01:40:30,913 --> 01:40:34,383
Ended in the river,
right near where it all began.

1230
01:40:44,594 --> 01:40:46,296
Excuse me a minute.

1231
01:41:24,099 --> 01:41:25,901
Forgot my toothbrush.

1232
01:41:31,006 --> 01:41:34,409
I'm sorry for a lot of things
I thought about you.

1233
01:41:34,811 --> 01:41:36,211
Don't be.

1234
01:41:36,812 --> 01:41:38,715
You were probably right.

1235
01:41:59,401 --> 01:42:02,503
Early this morning! Yeah. Fished her out.

1236
01:42:03,304 --> 01:42:06,908
I would say about 8:00 or 9:00 last night.

1237
01:42:14,781 --> 01:42:17,285
I got a honey of a story
from the girl's teacher.

1238
01:42:17,386 --> 01:42:19,087
A real tear-jerker.

1239
01:42:19,888 --> 01:42:22,090
Are you covering the funeral?

1240
01:42:29,497 --> 01:42:33,000
I got a picture of her,
but I thought we weren't allowed to use it.

1241
01:42:33,035 --> 01:42:35,903
Of course you can print it now.
The girl's dead!
