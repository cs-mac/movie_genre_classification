THE YEAR OF THE JELLYFISH

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,246
BASED ON THE NOVEL
"THE YEAR OF THE JELLYFISH" BY C. FRANK

3
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:02,188
SONG PERFORMED BY
NINA HAGEN

4
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,337
"Not yet. Not before noon"

5
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,483
You're sleeping?

6
00:01:49,235 --> 00:01:54,156
Vic called. He wants us to have lunch
with Marianne. You're coming?

7
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,369
I don't know.
- I'm thirsty.

8
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,538
What can I get you?

9
00:02:01,414 --> 00:02:03,874
I'm trying to last until noon at least.

10
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,212
I'm going swimming.
- Already?

11
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,068
How is it going, Salome?
- You fell out of bed?

12
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,654
I never made it to bed.
This is Dorothy.

13
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:37,033
Hi, your name's Salome?
- No.

14
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:42,038
If you want to have lunch, reserve.
There is an arrival.

15
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,168
No, thanks.
We're having lunch at "Le 80".

16
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:52,340
How're you doing? Who's that?
- I don't know.

17
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:01,223
Let's eat. It's too hot.
- Ten minutes.

18
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:05,102
At 30, you'll be an old,
wrinkled, dried up thing.

19
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:07,355
Too bad.

20
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:17,490
It's Guttaz.
Do you know how lucky you are?

21
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:33,172
(Speaking German)

22
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:38,928
Two Oranginas?

23
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:41,597
It's paid for.
- Oh, yes? By whom?

24
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,976
Nice, but...
- They want to eat with you?

25
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,145
I'll do it.
- Wait...

26
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,190
Yeah?
- Maybe.

27
00:03:51,524 --> 00:03:52,733
Okay?
- Okay.

28
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:56,654
What do you mean?

29
00:03:56,696 --> 00:03:59,365
You'd rather eat fries
on the public beach?

30
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:03,536
Where will you go?

31
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:06,122
I didn't know.
You should have told me.

32
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,541
Buddy, I can't tell you anything.

33
00:04:09,834 --> 00:04:12,128
You must ask me first.
Understand?

34
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,463
Okay.

35
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:18,968
You buy them drinks and
you let me operate. Get it?

36
00:04:27,018 --> 00:04:28,227
I'm listening.

37
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,479
A beer and fries.
- Two.

38
00:04:31,564 --> 00:04:35,901
Good job with your "maybes".
- Can't you leave me alone.

39
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,780
First year we came,
there was absolutely nothing.

40
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,450
The bay was such a beauty!

41
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:45,578
Yes, dad. The commoners have
seized your paradise.

42
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:47,913
So, why come back?
- I ask myself.

43
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:50,124
To pick up girls.
- Come on, Chris!

44
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:53,878
She's right.
It's for the memories too.

45
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:56,839
Tell us about your friend,
the politician's wife.

46
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:58,549
Lolotte?
- Oh no!

47
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,593
My son is not amused.

48
00:05:02,845 --> 00:05:05,514
Well,
how about the casino tonight?

49
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,433
Don't count me in.
- I'll go.

50
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:10,770
You're not legal.
- I can use a fake ID.

51
00:05:10,895 --> 00:05:13,522
You can lend me one
of your granny dresses.

52
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:14,648
Thank you.

53
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,318
You want to play?
- Win.

54
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:36,671
Miss,
we borrowed your newspaper.

55
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:40,257
That's all right. We read it. Keep it.

56
00:05:41,801 --> 00:05:44,261
Come on.
How about my recipe cards!

57
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:45,638
You never use them.

58
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:47,473
Peter Casteline,
my wife, Barbara.

59
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,850
Chris Riveaut.
My mother.

60
00:05:49,934 --> 00:05:52,978
Nice to meet you.
- You're going swimming?

61
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,730
No. I'm tanning.

62
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,108
Then, see you.
- See you.

63
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,821
No. Hey, look!
Not like that.

64
00:06:09,537 --> 00:06:11,163
Go get the ball.

65
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:16,085
Go hard with the racket.
It's all in the shoulder.

66
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,963
I am useless, you know.
- No, no, no.

67
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:23,050
Look at the movement.
You keep it going.

68
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,720
Don't panic. I'm coming.
I'll help you later.

69
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:27,263
Let's start over.

70
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:53,998
Cream please.
- Here it is.

71
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,294
Feeling better?
- I'm all right.

72
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,212
Drink this.
- What is it?

73
00:07:00,379 --> 00:07:02,214
Gin Fizz.
Exceptional.

74
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,759
Without my wife here, that was
bound to happen

75
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:07,219
Thank you.
- Is it true what they say?

76
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,598
What?
- That a jellyfish stung you.

77
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:13,893
I'm giving a 6:00PM
press conference at the bar.

78
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,687
Will that be all right?
- I don't know if I can come.

79
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:19,607
Who's she?

80
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,610
A bimbo.
- Thank you. I had noticed.

81
00:07:26,906 --> 00:07:28,574
Yes?
- Twenty minutes. Okay?

82
00:07:28,741 --> 00:07:30,826
No problem.
You're coming?

83
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,329
We're coming.
- Did you make the decision, Vic?

84
00:07:33,454 --> 00:07:36,082
No, he did. I think he feels
he has to watch his father.

85
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,877
If he had to impose him on you,
he felt he had to suffer too.

86
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,588
What a pain.
- Yeah. See you soon.

87
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:50,888
I'm old.

88
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:52,723
Stop your bullshit.

89
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:57,520
Yes, I'm old. Inside.
Nothing's like before anymore.

90
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,729
You're only 38.

91
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:00,564
I don't care.
I'm afraid.

92
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,983
Afraid of what?

93
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:05,528
Of not being able to hang it up.

94
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,950
Will you tell me
when it's time.

95
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:19,917
I will.

96
00:08:21,794 --> 00:08:23,963
What's the matter with you tonight?

97
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,592
I don't know.

98
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:42,106
13 red.
- 16 black.

99
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,653
No more bets.

100
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,952
No.

101
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:58,622
Another, please

102
00:08:59,832 --> 00:09:02,626
Is that you, Claude?
- Mr. Guttaz.

103
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,545
Pierre is here?
- No.

104
00:09:04,587 --> 00:09:07,423
He's working?
Do you know Romain?

105
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,008
I've seen him.

106
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:13,471
You're Salome's mom, right?

107
00:09:22,188 --> 00:09:23,356
Come over here.

108
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:29,153
I heard you got stung
by a jellyfish.

109
00:09:29,278 --> 00:09:31,197
Yeah.
- Show me.

110
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:34,533
What are you doing, Chris?

111
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:37,828
Do you know it will never go away.
- I know.

112
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:41,665
And you don't care.
You're right.

113
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:45,670
Can I dance with your mom?
- Anybody you wish, except me.

114
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:47,922
It goes without saying.

115
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:49,799
Let's go my dear lady.

116
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,728
I'm going back.
Can you hold them for me?

117
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,117
It's a waltz.
- Yes. So what?

118
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,763
How well do you know Guttaz?

119
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,459
I know his vices.
- Then you know him well.

120
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,187
No, the Guttaz labs can't be
only known for the sexual escapades.

121
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:48,315
How about you?
You know him well?

122
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,276
Neither vice, nor virtue.

123
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:52,903
My husband had
many business deals with him.

124
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,780
I believe he respects him.

125
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,866
And where's your husband?
- In Paris.

126
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:57,950
Poor guy.

127
00:10:57,992 --> 00:11:01,620
Oh, not at all.
He does not know how to relax.

128
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:06,709
Why did you want to dance with me?

129
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:12,048
Stupid question?
- Yes.

130
00:11:16,093 --> 00:11:18,679
May I know why you call
my daughter Salome?

131
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,097
No, you may not.

132
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:24,101
We talked about your husband
and now your daughter.

133
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,854
I don't like to dance
with several people at once.

134
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:29,106
You're forgetting Guttaz.
- I'm not.

135
00:11:29,148 --> 00:11:34,195
I used Guttaz to meet you,
so I can't count him as an undesirable.

136
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:36,781
You did what?
- Later.

137
00:11:46,582 --> 00:11:48,125
Where's the other one?

138
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:50,836
Here it is.

139
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,593
Sleep tight.

140
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,973
Romain is a strange guy.

141
00:12:03,599 --> 00:12:04,892
He's a pimp.

142
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,104
A what?
- A pimp.

143
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:12,983
Don't exaggerate.
A bit of a player for sure.

144
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:16,320
He hunts the girls on the beach.
He's a provider.

145
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,824
What? He's a provider?

146
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:23,911
Yes, on the port, in the villas.
He's a pimp.

147
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:26,539
How do you know this?

148
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:30,584
Everybody knows.

149
00:12:50,646 --> 00:12:52,523
I thought you had stopped.

150
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:56,235
Me too.

151
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,871
Can't sleep?

152
00:13:06,996 --> 00:13:08,748
Never before dawn.

153
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:13,044
Really.
Since when?

154
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:14,712
A few years.

155
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,173
How about you?

156
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,382
I don't know.

157
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,595
I'm stressed.

158
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,563
Call her a taxi.
That's all.

159
00:13:32,772 --> 00:13:36,108
I'll take the train.
- Not on Sundays. It's full of punks.

160
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:39,820
Let's give her a ride.
- Sure.

161
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,198
We'll drop her off.
- Nice of you, but...

162
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,825
That's no problem.
You'll miss your plane.

163
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:46,577
Well. Goodbye.

164
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:00,466
You can turn on the radio.
- No, thank you.

165
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,511
Very well.

166
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,442
You had a plan. That's why
you wanted to take the train?

167
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:21,487
No, no.
- You wanted to go home alone?

168
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:26,242
No.
It's on the right over there.

169
00:14:36,335 --> 00:14:38,838
You would rather nobody
saw me drop you off?

170
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,501
I have to go.

171
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,253
Hello, hello.
- It's me.

172
00:16:01,337 --> 00:16:03,631
Who's "me"?
- Vic.

173
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,342
Hi.
I thought you were with my parents.

174
00:16:06,425 --> 00:16:08,052
I call from the restaurant.

175
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:10,846
Really. Mom forgot something?

176
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:16,560
No, no.
- Hello.

177
00:16:18,604 --> 00:16:21,065
Chris.
- Yes.

178
00:16:21,482 --> 00:16:22,900
We'll meet?

179
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:26,946
I don't know. If you come up
later and I'm not in bed...

180
00:16:30,825 --> 00:16:33,994
Well. I have to go.

181
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,288
Don't mention
this call to your mother.

182
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:37,748
Okay.

183
00:16:42,837 --> 00:16:44,130
How about you, Vic?

184
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,800
Excuse me?

185
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,845
You're in a dream.
Is she pretty at least?

186
00:16:51,637 --> 00:16:54,348
Coffee, brandy?
- The bill.

187
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,308
The bill.

188
00:16:57,476 --> 00:17:01,439
Shall we have a drink at home?
- Yes, but just one.

189
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:11,323
Poor thing.
He really can't hear any longer?

190
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,035
Nothing at all.
- He's old.

191
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:21,208
In a way, it is restful.

192
00:17:21,667 --> 00:17:24,795
How's everything with Chris?
- Fine.

193
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:28,883
At least,
better than last year.

194
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:33,179
There's always a bad year.
For Christine it was 8th grade.

195
00:17:45,191 --> 00:17:48,027
I go pee and we're going.

196
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:48,988
Hi.
- Hello.

197
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:52,425
Danny.
She is a hall monitor at St Jeanne.

198
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:55,511
Teacher's aide.
- Don't be a pain.

199
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:07,148
She is sometimes nice too.
Shall we go?

200
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:28,127
Who lives here?
- Danny. When she's in Paris.

201
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,882
I had planned everything.
She changed her mind at the last minute.

202
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,134
She didn't want me here?
- Yeah.

203
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:40,264
She doesn't like the idea.
- Of course.

204
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:51,067
Are you crazy or what?
- What?

205
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:55,446
I didn't think you would do this.
- What?

206
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,450
There's only cold water
in this fucking room.

207
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,328
I thought that...

208
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,164
Well. I believed...

209
00:20:05,206 --> 00:20:07,291
I have to ask my mother
for the pill.

210
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,834
If you think that's easy.

211
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:11,962
Oh, shit. It's freezing.

212
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:17,968
I'm sorry.

213
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,982
Yes.
- It's me. Can you come?

214
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:34,235
Where?
- At home.

215
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,363
They went out.

216
00:20:38,155 --> 00:20:39,824
I'm going to try.

217
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,538
I have to pick up a file at the office.

218
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,708
Now?

219
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,835
They moved up
the project to Monday.

220
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,878
I would not be ready otherwise.

221
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,591
I'll be back in 45 minutes.

222
00:21:19,113 --> 00:21:21,782
Where are they?
- At the theater.

223
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:34,086
What's wrong?

224
00:21:37,089 --> 00:21:40,551
Nothing.
- Regrets?

225
00:21:42,178 --> 00:21:44,013
Maybe.

226
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:02,948
I wonder if you'll remember
this a few years from now.

227
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,744
Or if you will erase everything.

228
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,288
Why would I erase this.

229
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,254
I don't know.
That's the way it is.

230
00:22:17,505 --> 00:22:23,052
I wonder...
- Why are you so serious?

231
00:22:23,427 --> 00:22:25,596
It can't be the first time?

232
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,977
Yes.
- Really?

233
00:22:32,103 --> 00:22:33,771
This is not like me.

234
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:38,818
I always despised
those who do this.

235
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:40,528
Really. Why?

236
00:22:40,695 --> 00:22:43,239
Because of your father?

237
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:52,540
Yes.
Is that you, dad?

238
00:22:54,125 --> 00:22:56,919
No.
Nobody called.

239
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,008
Who?
Okay. If he calls, I'll tell him.

240
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,344
No, nothing.
I'm reading.

241
00:23:05,428 --> 00:23:07,304
This is the intermission?

242
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:12,184
All right.
I kiss you.

243
00:23:44,383 --> 00:23:47,928
No. It's not for a man.
- What?

244
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:51,974
I don't like it.
- That's not what you said.

245
00:23:52,058 --> 00:23:54,060
But that's what
I wanted to say.

246
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:06,906
It's Danny, the teacher's aide?
- She can go to hell.

247
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:10,743
I can't stand to be uptight.
Can't do this, can't do that.

248
00:24:10,868 --> 00:24:12,828
Where you go?
Whom you write to?

249
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:14,955
You call me Sunday?
You love me?

250
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:19,835
Let me look at you.
I'll stay with you, I'll watch you pee.

251
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:24,590
You're me, you're my daughter.
Everything I've never had. I've had it!

252
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:33,432
If you don't love, don't you have
at least a shred of compassion?

253
00:24:34,225 --> 00:24:35,476
You should talk.

254
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,895
She called your wife last week.

255
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:41,065
When?
- Wednesday.

256
00:24:41,107 --> 00:24:43,109
That's why I could not call you.

257
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:49,407
She spoke to Marianne?
- Yes. Or rather no.

258
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:53,411
She hung up when I promised
never to see you again.

259
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,464
Your wife must be waiting for you.

260
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,974
Claude called me.
- Yes.

261
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:00,770
She is at her wits' end.
- Why?

262
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,857
Keep it for yourself. She made me
swear not to talk about it.

263
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:07,068
Her daughter is pregnant.

264
00:26:09,028 --> 00:26:10,988
Chris?
Are you joking?

265
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,157
16.
Can you imagine.

266
00:26:13,949 --> 00:26:16,160
A good thing
we don't have daughters.

267
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:19,330
What will she do?

268
00:26:19,372 --> 00:26:22,124
What you do in this situation.
What else?

269
00:26:23,626 --> 00:26:25,044
Who's the father?

270
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:29,298
They don't know.
She won't say.

271
00:26:29,882 --> 00:26:31,509
Probably some other kid.

272
00:26:31,717 --> 00:26:33,177
What do you think?

273
00:26:38,307 --> 00:26:41,686
With or without a necklace?
- Without.

274
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:03,582
What are you doing here?
- Get in.

275
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:27,481
You're smoking now?
- Yes.

276
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:38,784
I know.
- Good for you.

277
00:27:41,954 --> 00:27:44,957
Why didn't you say anything?
- What for?

278
00:27:45,041 --> 00:27:48,169
I could have...
- No, nothing at all.

279
00:27:48,336 --> 00:27:51,881
I had to tell my mom.
I like it better that way.

280
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:55,968
Why?
- That's the way it is.

281
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:03,309
Do you blame me?
- This is where it ends, Vic.

282
00:28:03,434 --> 00:28:06,687
Next time, I'll just be
the daughter of your friends.

283
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:10,608
Don't try to talk or look at me.

284
00:28:11,609 --> 00:28:14,487
Don't call or write me, okay?

285
00:28:17,698 --> 00:28:19,784
Leave me there.
I'll take the train.

286
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:23,162
Listen...
- I like it better this way.

287
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:35,424
Come on,
don't make this long face.

288
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,766
Say hello to your wife.

289
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:17,383
I was looking for you.
- Really?

290
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,635
Of course.
- Your bike is so cool.

291
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,805
It's cool all right,
but it's not mine. Get on.

292
00:29:36,444 --> 00:29:40,322
Champagne.
- You have a gift for observation.

293
00:29:43,409 --> 00:29:49,415
Have you ever wondered at night
whether you'd see the sun again?

294
00:29:51,417 --> 00:29:53,544
No.
- No?

295
00:29:55,421 --> 00:29:58,090
I do wonder.
That's my Viking side.

296
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:11,729
Did you know Vikings
thought the earth was flat?

297
00:30:12,104 --> 00:30:15,399
That's why they did not sail
at night or in foggy weather.

298
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:19,028
Why's that?
- They would drop anchor and get drunk.

299
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:21,989
To forget about their fear.
- Fear of what?

300
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:28,079
The fear of void.
- I don't see the point between us.

301
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:29,997
It's better that way.

302
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:53,646
What are you thinking about?
- A friend.

303
00:30:53,729 --> 00:30:55,564
A friend?

304
00:30:56,482 --> 00:31:00,611
It's great. Guttaz and his lab.
I talked to you about him.

305
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,822
The guys on the beach?

306
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,783
Do you see the boat over there?

307
00:31:05,991 --> 00:31:08,119
Where I can see the light?

308
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:11,872
Do you know why there is a light?
- No.

309
00:31:13,249 --> 00:31:14,667
He's not sleeping.

310
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:16,460
You know why?

311
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:19,505
No.
- He's not sleeping because he's lonely.

312
00:31:20,631 --> 00:31:21,632
Really.

313
00:31:23,092 --> 00:31:25,386
You know what we're going to do?

314
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:31,892
You're going to see him.
- Me?

315
00:31:32,226 --> 00:31:34,395
What am I going to tell him?

316
00:31:35,563 --> 00:31:36,856
That I sent you.

317
00:31:40,276 --> 00:31:43,029
Do it for me.

318
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,753
You don't object, do you?

319
00:32:13,768 --> 00:32:16,854
Will I see you after?
- Of course.

320
00:32:39,543 --> 00:32:42,129
Yes.
- It's late, isn't it?

321
00:32:44,924 --> 00:32:47,218
Or early.
What's the matter?

322
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:49,720
An idea.
- I'm listening.

323
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,892
Breakfast on the port.
- No.

324
00:32:55,059 --> 00:32:59,146
Then I'm coming up.
- No, again.

325
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:06,487
That's enough.
- I'm downstairs.

326
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,490
So what?
- Well, nothing, but it's dumb.

327
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:12,368
Sorry you came for nothing.

328
00:33:13,536 --> 00:33:15,955
Can I sleep now?
- It's out of the question.

329
00:33:16,122 --> 00:33:18,332
Just hang up,
but you won't sleep.

330
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:21,544
I could call the hotel management.
- Yes, you can.

331
00:33:21,627 --> 00:33:22,837
But you won't.

332
00:33:25,506 --> 00:33:30,261
Well?
- Here's an idea. Be positive for once.

333
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:34,015
We don't know or talk to each other.
There's another idea.

334
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:37,143
Very bad, unsatisfying,
negative, cowardly.

335
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:39,228
Cowardly?
- Cowardly.

336
00:33:39,395 --> 00:33:41,105
I'm coming up.
- No.

337
00:33:42,481 --> 00:33:46,819
We're going in circles.
This booth is stuffy.

338
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:48,779
Nobody's forcing you.

339
00:33:48,821 --> 00:33:51,282
I'm coming up for five minutes.
- No.

340
00:33:51,741 --> 00:33:55,036
One minute.
- Neither.

341
00:33:55,327 --> 00:33:56,871
15 seconds

342
00:33:57,955 --> 00:33:59,957
What's the use for you?

343
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,043
To see you.

344
00:34:02,335 --> 00:34:04,253
We saw each other earlier.

345
00:34:05,504 --> 00:34:09,967
Alone.
- No.

346
00:34:15,306 --> 00:34:18,309
I've had it.
- Me too.

347
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:21,062
Let's get over it.

348
00:34:22,521 --> 00:34:26,067
15 seconds.
- Not one over.

349
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:36,535
Are you happy?

350
00:34:36,577 --> 00:34:40,915
Have you ever wondered at night
whether you would see the sun again?

351
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,377
No.
- I do. It's my Viking side.

352
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:48,089
The Vikings thought the earth was flat.
- What are you?

353
00:34:49,048 --> 00:34:50,675
What do you mean?

354
00:34:50,758 --> 00:34:54,428
I mean, what do you do?
- Oh, yes.

355
00:34:55,513 --> 00:35:00,851
Well?
- Your 15 seconds have elapsed.

356
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:08,067
What I do has nothing
to do with you.

357
00:35:09,735 --> 00:35:11,696
What do you mean?

358
00:35:13,447 --> 00:35:15,032
You're too old.

359
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,161
That's nice.

360
00:35:31,048 --> 00:35:34,135
They left with the current.

361
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:37,888
Jellyfish come and go.
Go ahead. It's all clear right now.

362
00:35:38,014 --> 00:35:39,223
Thank you.

363
00:35:48,691 --> 00:35:50,693
Slept well, Aldo?
- Alone.

364
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:52,778
Sorry.
- Don't be.

365
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:55,197
What do you want?
- A coffee.

366
00:35:55,573 --> 00:35:58,242
At the restaurant.
- Please, my dear Aldo.

367
00:35:58,325 --> 00:36:00,453
Stop it.
I'm not in the mood.

368
00:36:10,338 --> 00:36:13,007
Can you give me a ride.
I don't have a car.

369
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:27,813
Thank you.

370
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:38,074
At last.
I invited the Germans to lunch.

371
00:36:38,157 --> 00:36:40,951
Plus Vic and Marianne.
- I'm not hungry.

372
00:36:40,993 --> 00:36:42,495
I bought some fruits.

373
00:36:42,536 --> 00:36:45,831
I'll take your diets seriously
when you stop the scotch.

374
00:36:46,457 --> 00:36:48,417
What were you doing with Kalides?

375
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:50,836
His name is Kalides?

376
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:54,340
I gave him a ride.
He's Greek?

377
00:36:54,632 --> 00:36:57,968
Can you handle Vic?
He is pulling a long face.

378
00:37:02,098 --> 00:37:03,557
It's about time.

379
00:37:03,641 --> 00:37:08,354
How're you doing?
- Very well. Isn't that right?

380
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:13,984
Happy.
Happy to have lunch with you.

381
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,403
Isn't that right.

382
00:37:17,029 --> 00:37:18,739
Tell me about you.

383
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:22,576
Is this Vic?
- He's by himself.

384
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:24,620
Aren't they cute?

385
00:37:24,662 --> 00:37:27,581
Please, may I have a Kir.

386
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:32,461
She felt she had a duty
toward her peers.

387
00:37:32,586 --> 00:37:34,505
To share herself among them.

388
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:37,883
Having understood that
giving oneself was an illusion

389
00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:40,594
and what you give is just that.

390
00:37:40,678 --> 00:37:46,267
She had carefully studied the tool
you call postponement.

391
00:37:46,517 --> 00:37:47,893
Excuse me.

392
00:37:47,977 --> 00:37:53,274
She couldn't imagine at the end of
this meal as she was showing off her art

393
00:37:53,399 --> 00:37:56,569
that this year there was
a shadow hanging over her.

394
00:37:56,902 --> 00:38:00,364
She had felt danger
and danger had a face.

395
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:06,037
If a man with a machine gun shoots
aimlessly at a target, he would miss

396
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,207
feeling the joy of leaving
innocent bodies on the sidewalk.

397
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:16,047
Chris was enjoying
that kind of satisfaction.

398
00:38:30,061 --> 00:38:32,605
Here it is.
- Very good!

399
00:38:32,772 --> 00:38:35,274
Yes, quite.
You're going swimming?

400
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,117
How is he doing?
- Not great.

401
00:38:45,368 --> 00:38:50,247
It's hard at first.
It took Jerome a week.

402
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:54,752
It would take Jerome a week
even in bed with a girl.

403
00:38:57,171 --> 00:39:00,174
You're so mean.
- I'll be back.

404
00:39:04,303 --> 00:39:07,807
You're driving too fast.
- You're right, you're right.

405
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:10,476
Here.
Jean will pick it up tonight.

406
00:39:10,768 --> 00:39:14,313
Aldo, shit.
What the hell are you doing?

407
00:39:15,481 --> 00:39:17,858
My friend and I have been waiting
20 minutes.

408
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:20,611
What do you want?
- A "baby".

409
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:21,696
Make it two.

410
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:32,832
Thank you.
- For having tricked you.

411
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,835
Your frankness is refreshing.

412
00:39:36,127 --> 00:39:37,962
I am a refreshing type of guy.

413
00:39:42,508 --> 00:39:45,720
To us.
- To us for what?

414
00:39:48,389 --> 00:39:49,390
To us.

415
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:52,518
Maybe you were expecting
an old woman.

416
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:56,147
You should have listened better.
I did not say "old", I said "too old".

417
00:39:57,523 --> 00:40:00,276
So we're dealing with
a disinterested endeavor.

418
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:02,820
I dare say, not professional.

419
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,198
Calm down.
- I am very calm.

420
00:40:06,282 --> 00:40:08,492
You're chomping at the bit.
- Not at all.

421
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,828
Careful, 24 pushing on 80.
Adrenaline.

422
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:14,749
Too bad. I want it too much.
I'm going to kiss you.

423
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:16,625
Are you out of your mind!

424
00:40:21,881 --> 00:40:25,009
Well.
Nine, tonight at Fernand's?

425
00:40:26,469 --> 00:40:30,723
If I shave, she'll come.
- No.

426
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:33,059
Yes she will.
She will come.

427
00:40:33,184 --> 00:40:34,685
Who will come where?

428
00:40:35,311 --> 00:40:36,979
Stop.
You wet my shirt.

429
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,564
Answer.

430
00:40:39,065 --> 00:40:41,484
Stop it Salome.
I'm talking to your mother.

431
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:43,277
Why do you call her Salome?

432
00:40:43,444 --> 00:40:46,614
Ask her.
- He won't tell me either.

433
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,868
Dad's on the phone.
- What?

434
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,954
Your husband, Pierre Riveault.
Know him?

435
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:56,665
Couldn't you say
something earlier?

436
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:03,047
What do you want with my mother?
- Go build sandcastles.

437
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:07,593
I'm too old. I found other games.
- I know.

438
00:41:07,677 --> 00:41:09,679
Don't you want to play?

439
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:12,264
John the Baptist lost
his head over this.

440
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:15,017
Don't know him.
Where will you be tonight?

441
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:16,811
Not with you.

442
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:30,366
What are you doing?
- I'm giving you a hard on.

443
00:41:30,991 --> 00:41:34,912
Are you feeling anything?
No. So go build a sandcastle.

444
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:42,378
I saw Jean-Marc and Pamela.
They're saying "hi".

445
00:41:42,461 --> 00:41:48,092
And... That's all.
- When is he coming?

446
00:41:48,134 --> 00:41:50,011
Chris is asking
when you are coming.

447
00:41:51,137 --> 00:41:53,764
Okay.
Kiss you.

448
00:41:53,806 --> 00:41:57,268
When is he coming?
- He doesn't know yet. Soon.

449
00:41:57,476 --> 00:42:02,982
Why this sudden interest
in your father? Need your daddy?

450
00:42:03,649 --> 00:42:05,526
At least he did not break it.

451
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,111
I'd like to see you try.

452
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,488
Not too far.
We're leaving in an hour.

453
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,198
One hour.
Already.

454
00:42:18,956 --> 00:42:20,624
We hardly saw each other.

455
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:24,003
I don't understand.
- What?

456
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:28,257
What you want.
- You.

457
00:42:29,842 --> 00:42:30,843
Are you sure?

458
00:42:32,136 --> 00:42:33,763
Still so serious.

459
00:42:33,888 --> 00:42:36,390
Shall we see each other tonight?

460
00:42:37,475 --> 00:42:38,976
I don't know.

461
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:41,896
Eleven. Here.

462
00:42:48,361 --> 00:42:52,239
That's smart.
What am I going to look like now?

463
00:42:52,323 --> 00:42:53,908
You look fine.

464
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:56,702
Will you come?

465
00:43:00,206 --> 00:43:02,333
Go swim.
It will "cool" you off.

466
00:43:05,252 --> 00:43:08,547
Wow. You're so dark!
- No flattery.

467
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:10,466
I assure you.
You're gorgeous.

468
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:12,885
It's true you want
to go back to work.

469
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:17,098
I'm thinking about it.
Kids are grown up. I'm a bit bored.

470
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,935
It's a good idea.
You should do it.

471
00:43:21,977 --> 00:43:24,772
Don't suck up, will you.
- But that's what I think.

472
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:28,818
Feeling better?
- He wasn't feeling well?

473
00:43:28,901 --> 00:43:30,820
He was a bit too hot.

474
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:04,020
He won't come.
- What do you know?

475
00:44:05,938 --> 00:44:09,442
He called.
- Called who?

476
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,736
Aldo.

477
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:15,906
Why didn't Aldo tell me?
- He told me.

478
00:44:16,449 --> 00:44:19,994
Why you?
Why didn't he ask for me?

479
00:44:29,295 --> 00:44:31,922
Don't worry.
- Leave me alone.

480
00:45:16,967 --> 00:45:18,552
Leave some for others.

481
00:45:20,096 --> 00:45:21,597
Are you paying for it?

482
00:45:34,902 --> 00:45:38,072
Are you home?
- Yes.

483
00:45:38,531 --> 00:45:39,865
What's that?

484
00:45:40,116 --> 00:45:42,159
What is "that"?

485
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:43,452
The white jacket.

486
00:45:43,536 --> 00:45:45,204
You're going out?
Where?

487
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:48,249
At Lamotte's.
- Again?

488
00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:50,793
He invited some people.
I said we would go.

489
00:45:51,002 --> 00:45:53,671
I'm not going.
What people?

490
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:56,007
A writer, I think, and a doctor.

491
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:58,843
Go without me.
I'm going to get changed.

492
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:15,568
So.

493
00:46:23,075 --> 00:46:26,537
It's your first time here?
- You're kidding. I'm here all the time.

494
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:27,663
Really.

495
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:34,378
I'm his daughter's godfather.
- Who?

496
00:46:34,628 --> 00:46:37,256
Fernand.
When I first met her she was that high.

497
00:46:37,423 --> 00:46:39,925
Now, she is a little lady.

498
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:45,723
Can you help me
with my button here?

499
00:46:45,806 --> 00:46:49,185
Am I scaring you?
- Absolutely.

500
00:46:50,770 --> 00:46:53,689
Must be my advanced age.
- It intimidates me.

501
00:46:55,232 --> 00:46:56,233
Thank you.

502
00:47:00,613 --> 00:47:02,198
I'm happy you came.

503
00:47:05,576 --> 00:47:06,660
What?

504
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:10,456
Nothing.

505
00:47:38,651 --> 00:47:40,319
I didn't think you would come.

506
00:47:49,578 --> 00:47:50,579
Why?

507
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,249
It would not be the first time.

508
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,127
What do you mean?

509
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:58,921
Forget about it.

510
00:48:05,761 --> 00:48:09,098
Chris, it was you...
- I know. I did.

511
00:48:09,473 --> 00:48:14,353
I took the first steps.
I even spared you the breakup.

512
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,565
What a sucker!

513
00:48:17,815 --> 00:48:22,194
Listen, Chris.
It was going nowhere. It was hopeless.

514
00:48:24,697 --> 00:48:29,160
I would have followed you anywhere
if I had thought that...

515
00:48:50,806 --> 00:48:54,643
No. Not here.

516
00:48:55,644 --> 00:48:57,063
Not like that.

517
00:49:23,756 --> 00:49:25,716
What did you tell your wife?

518
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,431
That I had a meeting
with someone about my work.

519
00:49:33,683 --> 00:49:37,061
Do you think she believed you?
- Yes.

520
00:49:37,228 --> 00:49:41,440
With my mother and their friends
she probably don't think about it.

521
00:49:41,816 --> 00:49:44,402
Your mother?
- Yes. She is at your house.

522
00:49:45,027 --> 00:49:49,156
No.
- What do you mean "no"?

523
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,827
She's not at the villa.
At least not tonight.

524
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,870
Why?

525
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:57,498
You thought she was coming?

526
00:49:58,124 --> 00:50:03,004
It doesn't matter.
You must go home.

527
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,134
We have all the time
in the world.

528
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,095
I'll call you. Come.

529
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:17,101
Can I drive you home?
- I borrowed a moped.

530
00:50:23,983 --> 00:50:25,443
Think of me.

531
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:44,295
No, no, no.
I recognized the child.

532
00:50:44,754 --> 00:50:47,923
First, he was beautiful.
- You're buying wholesale.

533
00:50:48,049 --> 00:50:49,759
You can't refuse a child.

534
00:50:50,009 --> 00:50:53,846
This was before or
after the poker game?

535
00:50:54,096 --> 00:50:56,807
That was love.
I was riding motorcycles.

536
00:50:56,891 --> 00:50:57,933
In Sardegna?

537
00:50:58,893 --> 00:51:00,644
Well, yes...
In Sardegna.

538
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:05,691
And you sold the bikes to buy
the laundromat in Dijon?

539
00:51:06,734 --> 00:51:09,570
I sold the laundromat to buy the bikes.

540
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,365
I had won the laundromat...
- At poker?

541
00:51:12,656 --> 00:51:15,409
At poker. It's that simple.
- Yes. Very simple.

542
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:18,621
Where's that boat?
- Over there.

543
00:51:19,205 --> 00:51:20,456
She's got three.

544
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:24,710
There is a detail that I don't get.

545
00:51:24,835 --> 00:51:28,381
The Thai woman you married in Stockholm.
- Yes.

546
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:30,800
Where did you meet her?

547
00:51:32,551 --> 00:51:33,761
In Paris.

548
00:51:34,553 --> 00:51:36,305
While you were in law school.

549
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,683
Stop.
I hate to talk about myself.

550
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:43,979
Here. Look.

551
00:51:51,779 --> 00:51:53,155
Well.

552
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:55,366
Having scruples?

553
00:51:55,741 --> 00:51:57,368
No, I thought...
- Yes?

554
00:51:58,744 --> 00:52:00,079
No, nothing.

555
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,716
What are you doing?
- We're not staying here.

556
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:13,843
We're not?

557
00:52:37,324 --> 00:52:39,285
It was her.

558
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:41,287
Excuse me?

559
00:52:43,622 --> 00:52:45,875
Yes.
It was Salome in the harbor.

560
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,798
Should I take you home?

561
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:59,096
No.
We're staying right here.

562
00:53:08,689 --> 00:53:11,650
Are you planning
to stay this far away all night?

563
00:53:11,776 --> 00:53:12,985
No.
Not at all.

564
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:15,863
I was planning to do it discreetly
during the conversation.

565
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:19,909
Forget discretion.
Start the conversation.

566
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:52,483
What are you thinking about?

567
00:53:52,942 --> 00:53:54,652
You wouldn't believe me.

568
00:53:55,027 --> 00:53:56,821
Say it anyway.

569
00:53:56,862 --> 00:53:58,572
About my Mother.

570
00:54:00,408 --> 00:54:05,705
What my Mother said about love.
"I don't understand all this fuss

571
00:54:05,746 --> 00:54:08,874
and such a waste of time
for a matter of orifice"

572
00:54:08,999 --> 00:54:11,502
Yeah.
Is she dead?

573
00:54:12,461 --> 00:54:16,173
Yeah, yeah.
A long time ago.

574
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:25,850
Say.
Weren't you here last year?

575
00:54:29,061 --> 00:54:31,689
Yes,
but on another beach.

576
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:34,483
I spent two months in the hospital.

577
00:54:34,567 --> 00:54:38,654
An accident?
- No. A wasp.

578
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:39,989
What?

579
00:54:40,406 --> 00:54:43,868
I have an allergic nature.
Stung twice in one year.

580
00:54:43,909 --> 00:54:46,454
I ended up in the oxygen tent
and the rest.

581
00:54:47,705 --> 00:54:51,334
That stinks.
- That's the way it is.

582
00:54:53,753 --> 00:54:55,880
Do you see the boat
over there?

583
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:58,632
Terzian's boat.

584
00:54:58,716 --> 00:54:59,967
The one all lit up?

585
00:55:00,426 --> 00:55:02,845
It's lit up because
he doesn't sleep.

586
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:06,390
Do you know
why he doesn't sleep?

587
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,851
Because he's alone?

588
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:16,233
Shall we swim.
- You would not dare.

589
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,693
No.
I wouldn't dare.

590
00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:42,093
Shall I walk you back
to your car?

591
00:55:42,927 --> 00:55:44,261
Don't think so.

592
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:54,188
I suppose this is it?

593
00:55:55,439 --> 00:55:57,608
Are you saying
or are you asking?

594
00:55:58,150 --> 00:56:00,194
It's hard for me to leave.

595
00:56:03,322 --> 00:56:05,616
Not easy. Right?

596
00:56:07,993 --> 00:56:09,453
Thank you.

597
00:56:25,928 --> 00:56:28,848
We don't have breakfast
together that often.

598
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:30,307
That's nice.

599
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:33,019
I ordered American style.

600
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:36,147
Eggs, sausages, cereal,
pancakes, maple syrup.

601
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:38,274
I don't know if I can.

602
00:56:38,357 --> 00:56:42,028
Oh, yes. French breakfast
is notoriously insufficient.

603
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:46,407
Is there coffee at least?
- Yeah.

604
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:50,619
Your dinner finished late?

605
00:56:51,412 --> 00:56:53,247
There was no dinner.

606
00:56:53,414 --> 00:56:54,707
Really?
- No.

607
00:56:55,291 --> 00:56:58,502
The guests canceled.
Please, some sugar.

608
00:56:59,378 --> 00:57:01,505
When Marianne called,

609
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:04,300
they may have lost
the message downstairs.

610
00:57:04,425 --> 00:57:06,093
That stinks.
You must complain.

611
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:12,183
I left, and guess who I ran into
passing through the port.

612
00:57:13,351 --> 00:57:16,395
Who?
- Romain.

613
00:57:16,771 --> 00:57:18,189
Kalides?

614
00:57:20,191 --> 00:57:22,651
With his pals?
- No, alone.

615
00:57:22,860 --> 00:57:24,153
He's never alone.

616
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:27,239
He was.
Are there croissants?

617
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:30,034
Eggs, sausages, or pancakes.

618
00:57:30,242 --> 00:57:32,536
Pancakes.
Don't put anything on it.

619
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,955
Just a little...
- No, nothing.

620
00:57:35,039 --> 00:57:39,168
Plain pancake.
Well?

621
00:57:39,752 --> 00:57:41,629
He invited me to have dinner.

622
00:57:42,588 --> 00:57:43,964
He's funny that guy.

623
00:57:44,965 --> 00:57:45,925
Yeah.

624
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,885
Did you know he's allergic?

625
00:57:48,094 --> 00:57:50,888
Everybody knows it.
Wasps.

626
00:57:51,097 --> 00:57:54,016
He spent some time
in the hospital for that.

627
00:57:55,267 --> 00:57:57,144
You knew him last year?

628
00:57:57,311 --> 00:57:58,979
Longer than that.

629
00:57:59,063 --> 00:58:00,815
Two years.

630
00:58:00,898 --> 00:58:05,986
He was going to Colombes
and he water-skied at "L'ile Rouge".

631
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:08,989
The year before last.

632
00:58:11,701 --> 00:58:12,702
Really?

633
00:58:12,827 --> 00:58:15,329
They all teased him
about the wasp thing.

634
00:58:15,454 --> 00:58:18,082
He freaks out when he sees one
far away.

635
00:58:18,207 --> 00:58:20,626
Imagine how
he feels about the jellyfish.

636
00:58:20,751 --> 00:58:23,087
He won't go
in the water for days.

637
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:25,256
Poor guy.

638
00:58:25,756 --> 00:58:27,008
Yeah.

639
00:58:29,802 --> 00:58:33,597
You want that sausage?
- No. Be my guest.

640
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:39,186
Don't you eat that
with a fork and a knife?

641
00:58:41,272 --> 00:58:42,273
Yes.

642
00:58:46,569 --> 00:58:48,571
You're going to see him again?

643
00:58:49,155 --> 00:58:50,281
See whom?

644
00:58:51,991 --> 00:58:52,992
Romain.

645
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:54,994
I don't know.
Why?

646
00:58:55,327 --> 00:58:56,829
I don't know.

647
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:45,127
Are you sleeping, old woman?
- Yes.

648
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:48,255
Didn't sleep long enough
last night?

649
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:52,176
No, not enough.

650
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:21,080
Let's go to lunch?
- Yes.

651
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:23,124
Not right away.

652
01:00:26,419 --> 01:00:27,753
I called dad.

653
01:00:28,546 --> 01:00:30,006
When?
- Just now.

654
01:00:30,548 --> 01:00:33,426
Why?
- I wanted to.

655
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:35,553
Does it bother you?

656
01:00:35,803 --> 01:00:38,681
No.
Where did you call him from?

657
01:00:39,098 --> 01:00:44,061
From the restaurant.
He's trying to join us.

658
01:00:44,937 --> 01:00:46,897
Very well.

659
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,235
We're having lunch together?

660
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,070
With Romain.

661
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:09,670
Do you know
you are beautiful?

662
01:01:09,962 --> 01:01:12,631
Too fat.
- That's not true.

663
01:01:12,715 --> 01:01:15,760
Isn't she gorgeous?
- Of course.

664
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:19,472
(Speaking German)
- People speak French here.

665
01:01:19,638 --> 01:01:22,391
Okay.
- You're eating lunch with us.

666
01:01:22,475 --> 01:01:24,894
Yes, but...
- No "buts".

667
01:01:25,019 --> 01:01:27,271
Couples mustn't be alone
all the time.

668
01:01:27,396 --> 01:01:30,441
Mom, this nice little couple is
joining us for lunch.

669
01:01:30,649 --> 01:01:32,026
Fine.

670
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:34,278
Whatever the conversation,

671
01:01:34,403 --> 01:01:37,114
Chris made that Barbara
got all attention,

672
01:01:37,239 --> 01:01:39,408
encouraging her dialog
with Romain

673
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:42,536
and disengaging to start
another with her mother,

674
01:01:42,661 --> 01:01:44,455
skillfully including Peter.

675
01:01:45,498 --> 01:01:48,584
She created a kind of partition,

676
01:01:48,668 --> 01:01:50,836
dividing the table into 2 bubbles

677
01:01:50,961 --> 01:01:52,338
cut from each other

678
01:01:52,463 --> 01:01:56,175
where Chris could navigate
in and out at will.

679
01:01:57,593 --> 01:01:59,428
Romain waited a while.

680
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:02,056
Then started to destroy
her tactics.

681
01:02:02,181 --> 01:02:07,228
A sort of duel started,
with no obvious hostility

682
01:02:07,436 --> 01:02:09,689
and no staring at each other.

683
01:02:11,273 --> 01:02:12,942
Then Romain took over,

684
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:16,821
laid down the law and
Chris stopped talking.

685
01:02:16,862 --> 01:02:19,198
She could fight anything,

686
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:21,992
except those
who had made her fight.

687
01:02:22,076 --> 01:02:26,872
Romain could have won,
but Chris got an unexpected ally.

688
01:02:26,914 --> 01:02:29,709
They were in row
with their full uniforms...

689
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:33,004
We started releasing
the mooring ropes.

690
01:02:33,671 --> 01:02:39,135
We saw a guy coming...
The ugliest guy in the port.

691
01:02:40,011 --> 01:02:42,513
And then...

692
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,694
Chris.
- That's fine.

693
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:59,989
It's not a big deal,
just ask for ice.

694
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:14,920
Romain's laugh swept everything,
partitions, plots and alliances.

695
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:20,384
Nothing remained.
The score was a tie.

696
01:03:25,139 --> 01:03:28,017
I have a dinner tonight.
- With whom?

697
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:31,228
Jacques Monestier.
- Who's that?

698
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:33,189
He works with dad.

699
01:03:36,359 --> 01:03:39,111
When did that happen?
- Earlier.

700
01:03:41,197 --> 01:03:44,867
Show me who he is.
- He left.

701
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:47,244
He had an appointment
at "Le 80".

702
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:51,082
Oh, yes.

703
01:03:53,959 --> 01:03:56,462
You showered
without your top?

704
01:03:56,587 --> 01:03:58,464
Yes. Why?

705
01:03:59,590 --> 01:04:00,925
Nothing.

706
01:04:07,348 --> 01:04:09,892
Mom.
- Yes.

707
01:04:10,226 --> 01:04:13,229
You remember what you
asked me the other night?

708
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:16,107
That I should tell
you when it's time...

709
01:04:16,232 --> 01:04:19,276
To hang it up.
- Yes.

710
01:04:19,485 --> 01:04:21,946
I remember and so...

711
01:04:23,906 --> 01:04:25,491
I think it's time.

712
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:34,125
Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

713
01:05:05,031 --> 01:05:08,200
Hey, are you doing
something tonight?

714
01:05:08,701 --> 01:05:11,787
Nothing special.
- I'm inviting you.

715
01:05:11,871 --> 01:05:16,334
With your Mother?
- No, my mother's going out.

716
01:05:16,542 --> 01:05:20,379
I'm inviting you.
8:30 at the hotel?

717
01:05:20,463 --> 01:05:23,215
Dress nice.
We're going clubbing afterwards.

718
01:05:24,091 --> 01:05:26,344
I promise, we won't be bored.

719
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,360
There.

720
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:46,364
You're gorgeous.

721
01:05:48,699 --> 01:05:52,286
Really? I understood
something else at the beach.

722
01:05:52,370 --> 01:05:53,579
I was joking.

723
01:05:54,914 --> 01:05:57,750
Not many women
your age look that good.

724
01:05:58,334 --> 01:06:00,586
It's true.
I'm proud of you.

725
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,218
Listen.
- Yes.

726
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:13,015
You're acting weird this year.

727
01:06:14,642 --> 01:06:16,894
Tense.
- No, I'm fine.

728
01:06:17,561 --> 01:06:19,689
Go.
You're going to be late.

729
01:06:21,273 --> 01:06:25,653
Hurry.
Don't let Mr. Monestier wait.

730
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:39,917
What are you going to do?

731
01:06:40,584 --> 01:06:42,461
Don't worry about me.

732
01:08:05,044 --> 01:08:08,255
I'll take you back
to your hotel.

733
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:19,684
Not bad.

734
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:26,982
Cozy little pad.

735
01:08:29,276 --> 01:08:31,237
How's the bed?

736
01:08:37,952 --> 01:08:40,246
Are you waiting
to kick me out?

737
01:08:42,081 --> 01:08:46,877
Is that what you want?
- No, it's as you wish.

738
01:09:19,994 --> 01:09:21,787
Why are you staying there?

739
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:44,268
Chris is vulnerable.

740
01:09:44,685 --> 01:09:46,312
Last year for example...

741
01:09:51,317 --> 01:09:53,736
She had a good year in Pontoise.

742
01:09:54,153 --> 01:09:57,948
She could return to Victor Drury.
We were happy. All was well.

743
01:10:00,284 --> 01:10:03,245
Then Howard died.
- Howard?

744
01:10:03,454 --> 01:10:04,455
The dog.

745
01:10:04,872 --> 01:10:08,959
He was old, deaf.
He farted all the time.

746
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:13,881
One night we found him dead
in the living room.

747
01:10:15,424 --> 01:10:16,676
Chris found him.

748
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:35,945
What was bizarre is that she never
really took care of Howard.

749
01:10:36,070 --> 01:10:40,408
She never took him out.
You know, like all children.

750
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:43,744
Are you done?

751
01:10:46,497 --> 01:10:48,708
Little by little
she calmed down.

752
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:58,092
How do you do it?
- What do you mean?

753
01:10:58,551 --> 01:11:02,263
To start over so quickly?
- It's my job.

754
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,098
Go on.

755
01:11:04,682 --> 01:11:06,767
You're a piece of garbage.

756
01:11:09,228 --> 01:11:13,983
This proves that she is
more sensitive than people think.

757
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,570
And more secretive too.

758
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,405
Why are you smiling?

759
01:11:19,447 --> 01:11:21,532
Nothing.
You don't understand a thing.

760
01:11:21,699 --> 01:11:23,325
What do you mean?

761
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:26,996
I know my daughter
better than you.

762
01:11:27,747 --> 01:11:29,040
No.

763
01:12:51,163 --> 01:12:52,415
Hello.

764
01:12:55,126 --> 01:12:57,795
Hello.
- Hypocrite.

765
01:12:58,838 --> 01:13:02,049
Excuse me?
- You knew it was me.

766
01:13:03,134 --> 01:13:06,554
Yes.
- Are you alone?

767
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:09,223
No.

768
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:11,809
Now? With your wife
or you are cheating.

769
01:13:11,976 --> 01:13:15,229
With my father.
- Kiss him for me.

770
01:13:15,938 --> 01:13:18,566
Will you tell him that I like him?
- No.

771
01:13:18,649 --> 01:13:22,653
Bastard. Married son of a bitch.
I'm coming.

772
01:13:22,737 --> 01:13:24,864
But...
- No "buts". I'm coming.

773
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:28,826
Meet you at the chapel.
Like in the novels.

774
01:13:29,869 --> 01:13:32,663
I'll wear a cape with
nothing under. Okay with you?

775
01:13:34,665 --> 01:13:36,751
When?
- 20 minutes.

776
01:14:16,499 --> 01:14:20,544
Come closer.
- What?

777
01:14:22,296 --> 01:14:26,342
Do you love me?
- Yes.

778
01:14:28,302 --> 01:14:30,304
So tell me what you like.

779
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:43,526
What's the matter?

780
01:14:45,403 --> 01:14:48,948
You don't want to answer me?
- No.

781
01:14:51,033 --> 01:14:52,993
You would not like the answer.

782
01:14:54,745 --> 01:14:56,414
By the way. Me neither.

783
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,339
Something wrong?

784
01:15:05,715 --> 01:15:09,260
No.
Everything's going wrong.

785
01:15:13,639 --> 01:15:15,474
What about getting married?

786
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:18,019
We would have children
together.

787
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:21,856
They would be more handsome
and intelligent than yours.

788
01:15:23,441 --> 01:15:26,444
We would have a garden.
And dogs too.

789
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:27,945
What do you think?

790
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:35,411
It's all right.
I'm leaving.

791
01:15:35,619 --> 01:15:37,455
Why?

792
01:15:38,622 --> 01:15:40,291
No, I'm leaving you.

793
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:47,673
I'm leaving you to
your wife, children, father.

794
01:15:48,007 --> 01:15:52,428
To your villa,
to your shitty comfort.

795
01:15:52,553 --> 01:15:54,013
To your shitty life.

796
01:15:56,098 --> 01:15:57,850
Now,
I don't understand.

797
01:15:59,018 --> 01:16:00,895
It's just as well.

798
01:16:07,610 --> 01:16:11,655
No.
You have to understand.

799
01:16:13,783 --> 01:16:16,744
If I had wanted to, Vic,
you would have left them.

800
01:16:17,620 --> 01:16:20,039
Wife, children, everything.

801
01:16:23,292 --> 01:16:25,628
I could have used tears and sex,

802
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:27,963
wrapped you around my little finger.

803
01:16:29,632 --> 01:16:32,593
That's not difficult.
You're weak.

804
01:16:35,888 --> 01:16:37,848
You don't know what you want.

805
01:16:42,853 --> 01:16:45,022
I'm only 18,
but I'm older than you.

806
01:16:46,482 --> 01:16:49,485
Because no one ever
dictated my dreams.

807
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,782
I build them all alone
like a grownup.

808
01:16:58,202 --> 01:17:00,788
That's how I turned you on
the other day.

809
01:17:01,205 --> 01:17:02,498
For no purpose.

810
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:08,504
To see if you learned something.

811
01:17:11,424 --> 01:17:13,175
You learned nothing.

812
01:17:14,677 --> 01:17:19,557
You've aged.
You took money in.

813
01:17:20,099 --> 01:17:23,102
You stayed in your cozy,
little life.

814
01:17:24,437 --> 01:17:28,733
I just had to do "this"
for you to dive back in.

815
01:17:34,905 --> 01:17:37,408
Apart from that,
you have soft hands.

816
01:17:37,533 --> 01:17:40,411
You give nice caresses.
Good-bye.

817
01:17:59,138 --> 01:18:02,516
Do you hate me?
- No.

818
01:18:03,601 --> 01:18:05,519
Then, I was no use to you.

819
01:18:20,368 --> 01:18:22,078
You were waiting for me?

820
01:18:26,332 --> 01:18:30,211
Dad's arriving at 10.
We'd better sleep a little, right?

821
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:33,297
Are you happy, then?
- Very.

822
01:18:33,339 --> 01:18:35,633
How about you?
- What a question?

823
01:18:35,758 --> 01:18:37,885
You had fun?
- Not bad.

824
01:18:38,135 --> 01:18:40,638
How about Mr. Monestier?
- Nice man.

825
01:18:41,097 --> 01:18:42,848
But a bit boring.

826
01:18:51,691 --> 01:18:55,194
All alone?
My father's here.

827
01:18:55,277 --> 01:18:59,448
He's been on the phone all day.

828
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,118
He left.
- Who?

829
01:19:02,159 --> 01:19:05,996
We were feeling bad this morning
because of what...

830
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:07,665
You shouldn't have.

831
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:12,837
Peter wanted...

832
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:15,965
What's wrong?

833
01:19:16,549 --> 01:19:22,263
Peter wanted to return
to Germany right away.

834
01:19:22,555 --> 01:19:25,683
I said no.

835
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:31,397
And then?
- He thought that...

836
01:19:31,522 --> 01:19:36,027
He shouted a lot, his suitcases,
his money. I don't know.

837
01:19:40,531 --> 01:19:43,325
Why didn't you want
to leave with him?

838
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:48,664
Come on. Tell me.

839
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:55,671
By the way. I wanted to ask Chris.
- What?

840
01:19:56,505 --> 01:19:58,007
Why did she call me?

841
01:20:04,263 --> 01:20:06,599
You'll know where to find me.
- Aldo!

842
01:20:06,682 --> 01:20:09,310
A Scotch. Straight up.
- Are you nuts?

843
01:20:09,393 --> 01:20:10,978
Not for me, stupid.

844
01:20:11,145 --> 01:20:15,483
Tell me.
Why did you call me?

845
01:20:15,649 --> 01:20:18,194
I wanted to see you.
Is that illegal?

846
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:19,737
See you.

847
01:20:21,906 --> 01:20:24,700
You're going swimming?
- When?

848
01:20:25,868 --> 01:20:27,411
Whenever.

849
01:20:28,954 --> 01:20:29,955
Here.

850
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:39,924
I'm leaving.
I'll take the plane in Nice.

851
01:20:39,965 --> 01:20:44,261
I'll be home before him.
- Yes. Why not?

852
01:20:45,763 --> 01:20:49,100
It may not be that simple.
- What?

853
01:20:50,309 --> 01:20:51,560
No. Nothing.

854
01:20:55,147 --> 01:20:56,649
What do you mean?

855
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:02,571
Do you really believe he left
because of last night?

856
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:05,908
Don't you think
it might be an excuse?

857
01:21:06,409 --> 01:21:08,202
An excuse for what?

858
01:21:10,246 --> 01:21:11,580
For leaving you.

859
01:21:13,207 --> 01:21:16,293
Those last three days
he followed me everywhere.

860
01:21:16,460 --> 01:21:19,630
At the restaurants, the shops,
at the bar.

861
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:23,634
Why?

862
01:21:25,011 --> 01:21:27,096
He told me he no longer loved you.

863
01:21:28,055 --> 01:21:30,141
He did not know how to tell you.

864
01:21:32,018 --> 01:21:34,645
He's the one
who asked me to set this up.

865
01:21:36,355 --> 01:21:38,858
He said he would see me again
in Paris.

866
01:21:41,527 --> 01:21:45,781
When I refused,
he said he would leave you.

867
01:21:48,284 --> 01:21:50,828
Sorry. I did not want to tell you.

868
01:21:50,995 --> 01:21:54,457
You better know the truth
before you take the next plane back.

869
01:21:57,877 --> 01:22:00,296
Lunch?
- Barbara will have lunch with us.

870
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:01,380
Very well.

871
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:06,093
What's wrong?
- Nothing, it will pass.

872
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:08,971
We called their hotel.
He hadn't left yet.

873
01:22:09,055 --> 01:22:12,308
Not only did we miss the plane,

874
01:22:12,558 --> 01:22:15,644
but we had to spend the night
in the airport.

875
01:22:15,728 --> 01:22:17,980
That's what you said.
- What?

876
01:22:18,147 --> 01:22:23,194
Nothing.
I'm happy to see you.

877
01:22:23,235 --> 01:22:25,946
Really?
You seem surprised at saying that.

878
01:22:26,072 --> 01:22:27,406
A little. Yes.

879
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,374
He's having trouble.
- Who's that?

880
01:22:36,499 --> 01:22:38,000
Our local pimp.

881
01:22:38,751 --> 01:22:40,461
Do you know his customers?

882
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:45,341
Fernucci, Von HaffenSchultz,
Delfonso, and Yves Nickel.

883
01:22:45,424 --> 01:22:49,428
They are acquiring
the majority shares in the group.

884
01:22:49,595 --> 01:22:53,557
Mrs. Rivault,
there's a call for you.

885
01:22:55,685 --> 01:22:59,063
How come he left all of a sudden?
- I don't know.

886
01:22:59,563 --> 01:23:02,775
The house feels empty now.

887
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:06,195
Won't you come for dinner?
- Don't know. Pierre just got here.

888
01:23:06,362 --> 01:23:09,323
I'm going to ask him.
Don't hang up, okay?

889
01:23:10,783 --> 01:23:14,704
Vic and Marianne just left.
He feels a little lonely.

890
01:23:14,954 --> 01:23:17,123
Tonight it's only the two of us.

891
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:20,251
Okay.

892
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:24,380
Another time. Fine.
Good bye, Claude.

893
01:23:53,492 --> 01:23:57,121
Are you okay?
- Dear Mrs. Rivault.

894
01:23:57,371 --> 01:24:00,124
Shall I kiss you?
- No.

895
01:24:01,292 --> 01:24:03,836
Weren't you looking
for a little share?

896
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:06,297
Not so much.
I've got what I need.

897
01:24:07,048 --> 01:24:11,427
Shall I introduce you?
- Not necessary.

898
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:13,804
Three coffees.
- That's about time.

899
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,099
Here.
- Shit. Nothing smaller?

900
01:24:17,266 --> 01:24:18,768
No. Nothing smaller.

901
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:22,021
Do you miss me?

902
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:24,940
No.

903
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:31,447
Good. I'm going now.
- Bye.

904
01:24:35,743 --> 01:24:39,205
I'm kissing you.
- I'm sucking you.

905
01:24:40,373 --> 01:24:42,500
Here.
I put them on their tab.

906
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:44,669
That's not my money.
- I don't care.

907
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:48,506
You're right. That makes their coffee
over 20 bucks a piece.

908
01:24:48,589 --> 01:24:50,883
They've got money
- You're right.

909
01:24:51,175 --> 01:24:54,845
Do you want to meet them?
- They're drunk.

910
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,806
They're losing at being famous.

911
01:24:59,684 --> 01:25:03,854
Yes.
- Yes, what?

912
01:25:05,523 --> 01:25:06,982
I miss you.

913
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,495
I was looking for you.

914
01:25:20,496 --> 01:25:24,333
No kidding. What an event?
Shall we open a bottle?

915
01:25:24,417 --> 01:25:28,546
Stop the irony.
You don't know.

916
01:25:28,754 --> 01:25:32,008
What do you mean?
- Friends who would like to meet you.

917
01:25:32,133 --> 01:25:34,719
Let me introduce you.

918
01:25:38,639 --> 01:25:40,266
I was waiting for you.

919
01:25:42,435 --> 01:25:45,396
Well.
- I just wanted to confirm. That's all.

920
01:25:45,563 --> 01:25:48,482
Confirm what?
- That we're going out tonight.

921
01:25:49,692 --> 01:25:50,901
I'm not free.

922
01:25:51,402 --> 01:25:54,030
Cancel your date.
We're going out tonight.

923
01:25:54,947 --> 01:25:55,906
Or else?

924
01:25:55,990 --> 01:25:58,409
Or else,
I tell my father everything.

925
01:25:58,868 --> 01:26:00,327
I don't care.

926
01:26:00,453 --> 01:26:02,580
You could use this as an alibi.

927
01:26:03,998 --> 01:26:05,499
Alibi for what?

928
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:07,501
For you.

929
01:26:07,877 --> 01:26:13,299
I'm protecting the mother.
Not, I want to go out with the daughter.

930
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:18,054
I want to go out with the daughter?
- Yes.

931
01:26:19,847 --> 01:26:21,682
Drop it.

932
01:26:22,391 --> 01:26:25,895
No. If you refuse,
I'll tell everything. I swear.

933
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,108
You have to, Romain.

934
01:26:39,658 --> 01:26:42,203
10PM at the Citadel.
- Okay.

935
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:48,209
Whose piece of crap?
- A fianc? lent it to me.

936
01:26:48,292 --> 01:26:52,088
Another old hag.
See you tonight.

937
01:26:57,051 --> 01:27:02,181
As the moon shone over the roofs,
the vineyard and the lemon trees,

938
01:27:02,264 --> 01:27:05,351
The jellyfish were creeping in
by the thousands.

939
01:27:05,476 --> 01:27:11,399
Discreetly invading the shore
like a chorus walking on stage

940
01:27:11,524 --> 01:27:13,734
before the opening of the curtain.

941
01:27:25,371 --> 01:27:28,708
You thought I wasn't coming, right?
- No.

942
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,132
Here.

943
01:27:39,844 --> 01:27:41,721
Happy?
- Very.

944
01:27:46,684 --> 01:27:48,144
Where are we going?

945
01:27:53,065 --> 01:27:57,820
Well. You can choose.
The phantom train, the rocket of death.

946
01:27:57,903 --> 01:27:59,530
I want you to have fun.

947
01:28:00,156 --> 01:28:02,241
I'm going back.

948
01:28:19,759 --> 01:28:23,596
Fantastic, right?
Let's go to the next one. Come.

949
01:28:28,059 --> 01:28:31,729
Let's go.
- Already? Not having fun?

950
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:37,401
Not having fun.
Okay. Where do you want to go?

951
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,528
On your boat.

952
01:29:16,524 --> 01:29:18,109
Poor Salome.

953
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:23,322
Poor Salome who tried everything
for the last two years.

954
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:29,745
She follows me, tracks me down,
owns me, snubs me.

955
01:29:29,787 --> 01:29:34,583
She flirts with me.
In short, she waits for me.

956
01:29:34,834 --> 01:29:40,840
First it was a 16 year old Salome,
then 17 and now 18.

957
01:29:42,299 --> 01:29:45,636
Still here, beautiful.
- Yes.

958
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,974
I thought she would tire of this,
but no.

959
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:55,021
She did not tire of it.
- No.

960
01:29:55,604 --> 01:29:56,897
I guess not.

961
01:30:02,153 --> 01:30:05,948
Well then.
What are we going to do?

962
01:30:14,373 --> 01:30:17,960
Why did you screw my mother?
- Because I wanted to.

963
01:30:18,044 --> 01:30:19,045
No.

964
01:30:25,343 --> 01:30:26,719
I like her.
- No.

965
01:30:27,803 --> 01:30:29,221
Tell me the truth.

966
01:30:32,308 --> 01:30:34,810
If you want.
When the moment's right.

967
01:30:35,227 --> 01:30:40,483
You don't interest me.
And you can't be of any use to me.

968
01:30:40,900 --> 01:30:44,528
Is that clear?
You scare me.

969
01:30:44,737 --> 01:30:50,701
You're so predictable, ordinary,
obvious. It's pathetic.

970
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:58,542
Chris, my beautiful.
I know what you will become.

971
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:02,588
Really?
What will I become?

972
01:31:02,672 --> 01:31:04,382
You really want to know?

973
01:31:06,550 --> 01:31:10,680
In a few years you'll be married
to a strong, dependable guy.

974
01:31:10,763 --> 01:31:14,058
You'll have two kids.
A nice pad.

975
01:31:14,850 --> 01:31:20,856
A couple of domestics.
An elegant dog.

976
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:27,279
You'll be less beautiful than today,
but you'll be elegant, a pain in the ass.

977
01:31:28,155 --> 01:31:32,243
You'll never have
your mother's charm and intensity.

978
01:31:32,618 --> 01:31:33,744
Never.

979
01:31:36,163 --> 01:31:41,085
You'll be a wife,
a mother, a socialite.

980
01:31:41,168 --> 01:31:45,965
You'll only know power games
leaving you as dry as a diet biscuit.

981
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:50,302
And worse of all, beautiful Salome.
You'll be happy. I swear.

982
01:31:51,721 --> 01:31:54,640
You'll be a pain to your son
when he sucks at math.

983
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:56,475
Dress your daughter nicely.

984
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:59,437
And spend your summer
on the Island of Re.

985
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:03,274
Your husband will play tennis,
sail, water-ski.

986
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:07,361
You'll fuck once in a while
for maintenance.

987
01:32:08,529 --> 01:32:11,615
But deep down,
it will appeal to you less and less.

988
01:32:12,158 --> 01:32:17,913
At 40, if you ever meet a guy like me,
you'll spit on him.

989
01:32:20,458 --> 01:32:23,377
I know all this.
It's my job to know.

990
01:32:23,461 --> 01:32:26,756
Your job is to fuck chicks.
So, fuck me.

991
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:28,090
No.

992
01:32:36,474 --> 01:32:38,601
I love you.
- No.

993
01:32:40,227 --> 01:32:42,063
You can't even say it right.

994
01:33:05,169 --> 01:33:08,881
If you call me Salome,
I must be her type.

995
01:33:09,715 --> 01:33:11,967
That's how I see her.

996
01:33:15,012 --> 01:33:18,224
She performed a dance, right?
- Yes, she danced.

997
01:33:24,480 --> 01:33:26,482
Do you know why she danced?

998
01:33:42,456 --> 01:33:45,042
To have a man murdered.

999
01:35:24,684 --> 01:35:28,312
It was short.
- Short, but good.

1000
01:35:34,360 --> 01:35:39,115
What's the matter?
- I love you.

1001
01:35:39,782 --> 01:35:42,827
Really?
- Yes.

1002
01:35:43,327 --> 01:35:44,787
It's funny, isn't it?

1003
01:35:47,373 --> 01:35:49,542
Shall I walk you to your car?
- No.

1004
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:54,755
Chris must be sleeping.
- Let's go see.

1005
01:35:59,844 --> 01:36:03,764
Isn't she beautiful?
- Yes.

1006
01:36:19,196 --> 01:36:20,406
See you soon.

1007
01:36:20,698 --> 01:36:22,950
We'll be home
in a couple of days.

1008
01:36:23,117 --> 01:36:24,910
Really?
- Yes.

1009
01:36:25,244 --> 01:36:27,163
Call me when you get there.

1010
01:36:27,246 --> 01:36:29,582
On the beach?
- Why not.

1011
01:36:29,915 --> 01:36:31,167
If you want.

1012
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:37,590
You won't do it.
That's all right.

1013
01:36:40,051 --> 01:36:41,510
It stings!

1014
01:36:43,637 --> 01:36:47,099
Romain has disappeared.
- Really?

1015
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:53,606
His boat was found, stranded.
- He wasn't in it?

1016
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:55,441
No.

1017
01:36:56,400 --> 01:37:00,279
He must have done something stupid
and crashed the boat.

1018
01:37:01,155 --> 01:37:03,240
It's not the first time.

1019
01:37:05,826 --> 01:37:08,871
Hi.
- How're you doing?

1020
01:37:08,954 --> 01:37:12,333
Fine.
- No husband today?

1021
01:37:12,792 --> 01:37:17,463
No.
- What a day!

1022
01:37:17,546 --> 01:37:21,258
We can't swim.
It's full of jellyfish.

1023
01:37:21,550 --> 01:37:25,221
I know.
What a pain.

1024
01:37:30,393 --> 01:37:31,894
Already?

1025
01:37:34,522 --> 01:37:36,607
No news about Romain?
- No.

1026
01:37:56,752 --> 01:37:58,129
Aldo.

1027
01:38:04,677 --> 01:38:07,680
Two cokes, Aldo.
Well, my dear.

1028
01:38:07,930 --> 01:38:10,975
We're leaving.
- What do you mean?

1029
01:38:11,017 --> 01:38:14,186
I want to leave.
- When?

1030
01:38:14,770 --> 01:38:17,857
I don't know.
Today. Okay?

1031
01:38:18,816 --> 01:38:22,486
Tonight then.
I have to do something.

1032
01:38:22,528 --> 01:38:25,448
What "something"?
- Something.

1033
01:38:26,073 --> 01:38:29,160
Tonight it is.
I'll make reservations.

1034
01:38:29,243 --> 01:38:30,369
You do that.

1035
01:38:55,186 --> 01:38:59,357
How are you doing?
- Fine.

1036
01:38:59,440 --> 01:39:02,860
This is Barbara.
She is very nice.

1037
01:39:02,943 --> 01:39:04,820
Hello.
- Hello.

1038
01:39:04,904 --> 01:39:07,573
Well.
Coffee, alcohol, Schweppes.

1039
01:39:07,698 --> 01:39:10,701
Schweppes for me, alcohol for her.
- No, thanks.

1040
01:39:10,826 --> 01:39:11,827
Don't argue.

1041
01:39:11,952 --> 01:39:13,996
Cognac.
- Just what she needs.

1042
01:39:27,718 --> 01:39:32,264
Are you coming?
- Go. It's 80 in there.

1043
01:39:32,431 --> 01:39:33,683
Thank you.

1044
01:39:39,271 --> 01:39:41,315
Bathing suits are not allowed here.

1045
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,945
Don't be silly.

1046
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:21,564
Here.
Tell me what you think.

1047
01:40:27,778 --> 01:40:30,281
Very good.
- You too.

1048
01:40:30,322 --> 01:40:33,743
My friend is cute. Isn't she?
- Very cute.

1049
01:40:34,535 --> 01:40:37,955
With this type of body,
you don't have a place to hang on to.

1050
01:40:37,997 --> 01:40:39,457
Please.

1051
01:40:39,498 --> 01:40:44,128
Usually there's a hefty side,
short legs, low butt.

1052
01:40:44,170 --> 01:40:48,466
Stop.
- But here...

1053
01:41:03,022 --> 01:41:06,359
Your mother called me earlier.
- Really?

1054
01:41:06,859 --> 01:41:11,655
Is she better?
- Yes. She will be.

1055
01:41:13,032 --> 01:41:16,160
We're leaving.
- You too?

1056
01:41:17,203 --> 01:41:20,039
We are.
- When are you leaving?

1057
01:41:20,623 --> 01:41:23,417
Right away.
Tonight.

1058
01:41:30,007 --> 01:41:34,679
Can Barbara stay a little longer?
- Of course.

1059
01:41:55,908 --> 01:41:58,119
We're going.
- What's the matter?

1060
01:42:07,628 --> 01:42:12,174
Romain's dead.
- That's impossible.

1061
01:42:13,342 --> 01:42:17,680
Yes.
He fell off his boat.

1062
01:42:19,348 --> 01:42:23,728
I don't know.
- It can't be what...

1063
01:42:25,896 --> 01:42:26,897
A jellyfish.

1064
01:42:29,942 --> 01:42:31,318
Shit.

1065
01:42:43,080 --> 01:42:45,249
Let's go.
We're going to be late.

1066
01:43:16,989 --> 01:43:20,451
Today Chris is married to
a young doctor, and has two children.

1067
01:43:20,534 --> 01:43:25,456
She is among thousands like her.
She is satisfied with her ordinary life.

1068
01:43:25,539 --> 01:43:28,292
Of the events reported here
she has nothing left.

1069
01:43:28,376 --> 01:43:30,086
But for two scars,

1070
01:43:30,169 --> 01:43:33,798
one on her right shoulder
and the other on her left breast.
