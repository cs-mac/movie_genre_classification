Hey.

23
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,552
They got good players.

24
00:02:43,396 --> 00:02:45,489
They're number one or two
in the prefecture.

25
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:47,065
Yeah?

26
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:51,501
First of all, they have a good pitcher.
His fastball's got heat.

27
00:02:53,306 --> 00:02:55,001
Does it?

28
00:02:55,575 --> 00:02:56,405
Care for one?

29
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,178
Wow, thanks.

30
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,346
Is there a batter
who can take him on?

31
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:07,114
Not a chance.
No one can hit his pitch.

32
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,281
The "Smoke Ball," they call it.
Slides by just like smoke.

33
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,853
Our boss loves baseball.

34
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:17,521
But he's got a good offer from Mito.

35
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,858
They poached him?

36
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,730
Money talks.

37
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,765
Where in Mito?

38
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:34,507
Hey, Old Lady Takayama.

39
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,582
You got a visitor.

40
00:03:37,684 --> 00:03:39,117
Thanks.

41
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,381
Are you the mother
of Mitsuo Takayama?

42
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,117
Yes.
Are you from the factory?

43
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,717
No. Where can I find Mitsuo now?

44
00:03:48,828 --> 00:03:50,693
He's sleeping at home.

45
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:51,923
What?

46
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,998
He's an idiot.

47
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,465
What happened?

48
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:58,002
He lost a finger at the factory.

49
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:01,403
What do you want with Mitsuo?

50
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,170
Nothing, not anymore.
Wish him well. Good-bye.

TOYO FLOWERS

52
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,391
I'm back, Boss.

53
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:27,898
Welcome back.

54
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:29,468
You don't look happy.

55
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,828
I had to bring this back.

56
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,569
What happened?
I got your telegram.

57
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:36,539
This is going to cost us a fortune.

58
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:37,905
Yeah?

59
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:41,140
Get me Manager Miyazawa.
And get us a taxi.

60
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,339
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

61
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:45,550
It didn't work out?
Another team got him?

62
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:48,120
He lost a finger on a lathe.

63
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,950
It's a damn shame, Boss.

64
00:04:50,523 --> 00:04:53,458
Too bad.
We could've gotten him cheap.

65
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,089
Hey.

66
00:04:56,195 --> 00:04:57,355
Welcome back.

67
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,454
There's a reason
we called you back.

68
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:01,032
Kurita at Syowa University.

69
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,965
What?
Can we get him?

70
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:04,366
We want him.

71
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,267
Let's go.
We'll tell you in the car.

72
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:10,035
Ippei Kyuki. His last name is "Ball Spirit"?
Who the hell is he?

73
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,974
We have no idea who he is.

74
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,740
- A leech?
- Could be.

75
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,078
He brought Kurita out to Tokyo
and sent him to college.

76
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:19,549
His benefactor, I guess.

77
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,086
Watch out!

78
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:24,386
Idiot!

79
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,844
KURITA

80
00:05:54,954 --> 00:06:00,517
Hit it, slug it, Kurita!

81
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,823
Hit it, Kurita.
Slug it, Kurita.

82
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:07,161
<i>Batter is uniform number 3,</i>
<i>center fielder, Kurita.</i>

83
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:12,863
Hooray! Hooray!

84
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:15,840
Kurita!

85
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:18,376
He's well built.

86
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,343
No wonder every scout is <i>after</i> him.

87
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:21,913
Kurita!

88
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,097
Furukawa with the Socks
is over there.

89
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:41,032
Handen wants him, too.

90
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:54,503
He didn't need to hit that.

91
00:06:54,614 --> 00:06:56,275
He's raising his price.

92
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:57,508
Kurita!

93
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:12,493
<i>Batter is uniform number 4,</i>
<i>first baseman, Ohmura.</i>

94
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,623
Hey, you're here, too?

95
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,861
That's Natsume,
the scout with Kyushu.

96
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:22,974
Kurita has many suitors.

97
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,920
DAITO TRADING COMPANY

98
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:21,063
Who is it?

99
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,960
Is Mr. Kyuki here?

100
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:28,997
Which ball club are you with?

101
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,097
Huh?

102
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,836
You're the third one.

103
00:08:32,545 --> 00:08:33,671
You're a scout, aren't you?

104
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:38,575
Mr. Kyuki?

105
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,117
No, I'm president here.

106
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:42,687
Oops, I'm sorry.

107
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,154
I'm Kishimoto
with the Toyo Flowers.

108
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,885
The Toyo Flowers?

109
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,017
Go away.

110
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,195
Besides, you're too late.

111
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,128
Kurita is, mind you, a big deal.

112
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:56,599
The Handen Lilies and the Osaka Socks
were here a week ago.

113
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:00,204
Your new manager,
what's his name, Miyazawa?

114
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,503
He's too young.
He hasn't got an eye for players.

115
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:05,535
Is he?

116
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:07,909
I've been saying this
since last year.

117
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:10,847
If you take Kurita,
your team will be twice as strong.

118
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,646
Please help us out.
The Toyo Flowers are anxious to...

119
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:17,086
Don't be stupid.
I'm anxious for the Flowers.

120
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,784
I'm sweating 'cause
I want you to take him.

121
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,521
Are you a fan of the team?

122
00:09:32,805 --> 00:09:35,933
No, what're you doing?
You creep.

123
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,707
You fool.

124
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:43,142
Here comes Kyuki.

125
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,453
Kyuki.

126
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,516
This is Kishimoto,
a scout with the Toyo Flowers.

127
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,959
My name is Kishimoto.
Nice to meet you.

128
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,616
<i>He's a piece of work.</i>

129
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,855
<i>They said he was eccentric.</i>

130
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,090
<i>This man is a tough customer.</i>

131
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,365
If it's about Kurita, go away.

132
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:43,170
No, I won't go away.
I'm asking you to help us.

133
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:46,403
If Kurita joins our team,
we can win next year.

134
00:10:46,512 --> 00:10:48,605
Every team wants to win.

135
00:10:49,615 --> 00:10:50,707
Please.

136
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,978
I don't like flatterers.

137
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:58,187
For example, Furukawa
with the Osaka Socks.

138
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,815
You know him?

139
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:04,362
Really, Kurita is
the hardest hitter in Japan.

140
00:11:04,463 --> 00:11:08,058
You've trained him, Mr. Kyuki.
You're the best coach in Japan.

141
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:11,835
I hate people like him the most.

142
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:17,634
On the other hand,
the Handen scout, Shima...

143
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,237
A dog needs a collar. A horse, reins.
A nation, a prime minister.

144
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,782
A good player needs a good coach.
That's the bottom line.

145
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:26,909
I don't like anyone.

146
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,310
I'm turning you down.

147
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,356
Please don't be hasty.

148
00:11:32,591 --> 00:11:35,082
Didn't you see me
taking medication just now?

149
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,161
Huh?

150
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,490
Listen, he's ill.

151
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,567
Just as well,
I'll take the sake.

152
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,199
Thank you.

153
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:48,436
I knew he was no ordinary rat.

154
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,009
He's a slimy sewer rat.
I don't like him, Boss.

155
00:11:52,178 --> 00:11:54,043
You're the rat.

156
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:56,944
You stay on him. Don't let up.

157
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:21,503
Excuse me.

158
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:25,667
Here.

159
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,997
They have no common courtesy.

160
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,071
Kuri and I are closer
than father and son.

161
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:56,268
Kuri won't even meet them
for coffee without me.

162
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,240
Of course he wouldn't.

163
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:01,073
Have a drink.

164
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:05,974
The newspaper reporters say
you're like two peas in a pod.

165
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,450
Don't flatter me.

166
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:11,354
Don't they call me a leech?

167
00:13:12,992 --> 00:13:14,550
Of course not.

168
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,457
They say Kurita owes you his life.

169
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:25,200
You've made him who he is now.
Must've been hard work.

170
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:29,366
Nobody acknowledged his talent.

171
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:33,205
I taught him everything, from A to Z.

172
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,309
He learned so quickly.

173
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:42,381
I hear you paid for all
of Kurita's college tuition.

174
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,786
It wasn't much to speak of.

175
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,084
But it's four years.

176
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,626
That's a vast sum of money.

177
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:53,221
I gather Kurita's family
is indebted to you, Mr. Kyuki.

178
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:56,394
His family is rather complicated.

179
00:13:57,269 --> 00:14:00,898
He's got four brothers.
The two oldest are from a different mother.

180
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:03,236
The oldest is an ex-con.

181
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,810
With all that,
Kuri must've been feeling Ionely.

182
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,380
He bonded with me
like I'm his father.

183
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:24,123
What's wrong?

184
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,460
I have a stone.
A gallstone.

185
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:32,202
Are you seeing a doctor?

186
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,863
I had it checked at a medical school
in Osaka last year.

187
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:37,806
They said I needed an operation.

188
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,208
You have to take care of yourself.

189
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,514
That's an interesting watch.
May I take a look?

190
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:49,048
Without this,
I tend to forget to take my medication.

191
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,382
I see.

192
00:14:51,924 --> 00:14:53,585
By the way...

193
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,126
can our team pay some
of Kurita's college tuition?

194
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,697
Let's go.

195
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,762
You want to solve everything with money.
I don't like it.

196
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,271
Excuse me.

197
00:15:14,346 --> 00:15:16,075
Mr. Kyuki, what's wrong?

198
00:15:21,387 --> 00:15:24,117
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>I gotta take advantage of this.</i>

199
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:27,351
<i>This man has a weakness, too, Boss.</i>

200
00:15:30,195 --> 00:15:33,358
Hello, is anybody here?
Get a doctor.

201
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:35,500
I was surprised.

202
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:38,569
I didn't know
you'd writhe in such agony.

203
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,696
It happens whenever
I eat anything greasy.

204
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:46,005
I see. Our team has a good doctor.
Why don't you let him take a look?

205
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,307
What kind of strings are attached?

206
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,581
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:51,741
Pull over.

208
00:15:57,589 --> 00:15:58,886
Please, come on.

209
00:15:58,991 --> 00:16:01,653
- Where are you taking me?
- Don't worry about it.

210
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,324
Good evening.

211
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,800
Hello.

212
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,700
- Mr. Kishimoto.
- Hi.

213
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:14,238
Welcome, sir.

214
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,103
Show us some fabrics for him.

215
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,176
Mr. Kishimoto, please don't.

216
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,745
Don't worry about it.
Just a token of my goodwill.

217
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:23,007
You shouldn't do that.
I'm leaving.

218
00:16:25,684 --> 00:16:26,981
Mr. Kyuki.

219
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,547
Don't try a cheap trick.

220
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,414
Taxi!

221
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,227
Please go on.
I'll find a cab.

222
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,996
Then take this.
For the tailor. Might not be enough.

223
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,593
You're doing too much.

224
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:47,831
Don't worry about it.
Go on.

225
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,911
Good night.
Can I call you tomorrow?

226
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,104
I'm not going to work tomorrow.

227
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,542
But...

228
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:14,425
Don't come in.
I'm in the bath now.

229
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,936
You can't come in.
Who is it?

230
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:20,632
It's me.

231
00:17:21,173 --> 00:17:23,368
You're no exception.
You have no manners.

232
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,240
Where have you been?

233
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,471
- Making money.
- Mahjong again?

234
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:29,740
Lottery. If I win, I win big.

235
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,282
- Want me to join you?
- Idiot.

236
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,785
Kuri's here.

237
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:35,946
Kurita is?

238
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:41,782
You're here.

239
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,156
I'm having a rough night.

240
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:46,322
I took her to Togeki Theater and Hibiya.
Now we're fighting over dinner.

241
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:50,198
We need to talk.

242
00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:54,205
Fueko, sorry, would you
excuse yourself a moment?

243
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,968
I'm going to change.

244
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,611
Secret conference?

245
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,942
I find Mr. Kyuki creepy.

246
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:05,382
Don't bad-mouth him
in my presence.

247
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:06,883
I'm not bad-mouthing him.

248
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,979
He's fooling my sister, too.

249
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:14,526
He says, "I'll get a divorce," but then
sends money to his wife in Okayama.

250
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,251
You know nothing, Kurita.

251
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:33,269
Want a little money, Fueko?

252
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,574
I interrupted your fun.

253
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,814
I'm not like my sister.

254
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:51,225
Sorry to keep you waiting.
You gonna make the dorm curfew?

255
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,661
Yes.

256
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:53,992
Here's the thing.

257
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:58,832
Kishimoto from the Toyo Flowers
came to see me today.

258
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:01,064
He said he wanted to see you.

259
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,574
Please turn him down.
I still have the College League fall games.

260
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:08,342
Swing the bat one more time.

261
00:19:11,016 --> 00:19:13,814
You're opening too early.
Let me have it.

262
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,787
When you take a swing,
you open up this arm too soon.

263
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,020
Like this?

264
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,897
But you met Shima,
the scout from Handen.

265
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,628
It's weird to meet one,
but not the other.

266
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,430
Of course I understand
you're going to college.

267
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,998
You can focus on the College League
until graduation.

268
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:43,546
They wouldn't like student players
negotiating with pro teams.

269
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,048
I wouldn't like it, either.

270
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,883
But if you...
I'm saying "if'...

271
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,049
If you want to go into
professional baseball,

272
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,453
it's not good to give their scouts
a bad impression.

273
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:58,155
I'll leave it all to you, Mr. Kyuki.

274
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,462
- Do you trust me with everything?
- Yes.

275
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:04,636
I can handle all the talks
with the pros?

276
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:05,794
Yes.

277
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,404
You won't regret it.

278
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,305
Excuse me, now.

279
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,978
It's okay.
You gave me some the other day.

280
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:18,606
You'd be running out of it.

281
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,345
An empty wallet
makes the bat slow down.

282
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:24,749
HANDEN LILIES SCHEDULE

283
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:29,156
"No deals until <i>after</i> the championships."
Kyuki's violating Kurita's human rights.

284
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:30,888
He wants more money.

285
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:34,363
The leech invokes his legal right.
That's Japan in a nutshell.

286
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,298
You just need to get to Kurita.

287
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,835
Leave it to me.

288
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,771
Kurita is off on the 16th.
I'm taking him to an all-girl musical.

289
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,603
Boys like him don't go for
sophisticated shows.

290
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:47,076
Revues are the best.

291
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,647
Those scalpers are parasites.

292
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,080
I said, "Three tickets."
He said, "Five grand."

293
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,209
I said, "No way I can pay five."

294
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,378
He said,
"Give me five, or go away."

295
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,456
I had no choice
but to give him five.

296
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,991
It's just so stupid.

297
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:03,152
Stop complaining. Ouch.

298
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:05,891
Get in touch with Kyuki.

299
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,465
Oh, yeah. I gotta work.

300
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:25,480
Aren't you spending
too much money?

301
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:27,211
I need to spend money.

302
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:29,947
He's got a leech.
Don't worry about the money.

303
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,956
Isn't it the job of a scout
to be <i>thrifty?</i>

304
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:36,255
I know that, Boss,
but we've got to bait the trap.

305
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:40,423
Kyuki is only sniffing around.
We haven't caught him yet.

306
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:41,829
I get it.

307
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,458
I'll leave the sumo tickets
with the tea shop.

308
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:45,729
Okay.

309
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,372
Okay. I see.

310
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,070
The thing is, he's busy on the 16th.

311
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:56,409
He needs to decline your invitation.
That's his message.

312
00:21:56,515 --> 00:21:59,075
Decline?
I've already got tickets.

313
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,516
I'm so sorry.

314
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:04,480
Yes, but...

315
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:06,957
I'm sorry.

316
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:14,996
What? You don't know where he is?
It's the Flyweight Championship.

317
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,500
He won't see a fight like this
ever again.

318
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,194
You're putting me in a corner.

319
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,238
I paid 5,000 yen to a scalper.

320
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,739
Give them to me.

321
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,967
But you hate boxing.

322
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:26,237
I can sell them.
Spend the night.

323
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,745
Tonight?
Hello? Hello?

324
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,441
Yes. I'm sorry.

325
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:34,110
I'll tell him when he's home.

326
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:46,189
Ouch. That hurts.
You're so mean.

327
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,026
That's what they're saying.

328
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:54,766
<i>Keep fighting.</i>

329
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,102
Keep fighting.
Fight, fight.

330
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,710
That's the spirit!
Keep fighting.

331
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:12,684
Oh, no. I lost again.

332
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,386
Here's your 1,000 yen.
Here you go.

333
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:18,429
Stop it already, Mr. Kishimoto.
He'll take the shirt off your back.

334
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,361
Then I'll get into
the sumo ring myself.

335
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:24,564
Let's bet on the next match.
- I feel bad for you. Let's not.

336
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:27,297
Turning your back on a bet?

337
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:30,136
Look behind you.
We'd be a bad influence.

338
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,081
Is she Kurita's girlfriend?

339
00:23:44,723 --> 00:23:46,054
I'll go get her.

340
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:55,157
Hello there.
Everybody's waiting for you.

341
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,198
I've seen you before
at Jingu Stadium.

342
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:08,404
<i>What a stuck-up...</i>

343
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,876
<i>But the way Kurita</i>
<i>was looking at her...</i>

344
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,451
<i>They're in love, Boss.</i>

345
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:17,044
<i>I have to win her over.</i>

346
00:24:18,757 --> 00:24:22,557
Put together something
to take home for three.

347
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,094
Mr. Kyuki, welcome.

348
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:35,037
What's going on?
I haven't seen you in a while.

349
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,904
I'm having a problem getting permission
to import canned pineapples.

350
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:40,204
Do you know of a good contact?

351
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,075
I don't know of any.

352
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,442
Mr. Kishimoto.

353
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:50,417
Don't talk to Kuri without me.

354
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:52,755
I know.

355
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:54,792
Problem is,
too many people don't.

356
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,619
They want to cut to the chase.

357
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,656
Your Chinese is impressive.

358
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,062
Are you surprised?

359
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:05,534
I used to teach bayonet fighting
to young Chinese girls.

360
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,445
Sorry I <i>left</i> you.

361
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:20,283
Care for a drink?
- No, I can't really drink.

362
00:25:20,385 --> 00:25:21,716
Oh, my. I see.

363
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:25,212
Your only fun is baseball?
- Yeah, sort of.

364
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,022
What are you going to do
<i>after</i> graduation?

365
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:32,858
Any interest in pro baseball?

366
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,667
I haven't thought that far ahead.

367
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,595
Well...

368
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:43,397
The world of professional baseball
isn't an easy place to live in.

369
00:25:43,508 --> 00:25:45,635
But it can be a fun place
if you have talent.

370
00:25:46,177 --> 00:25:48,145
You rely on your skills
to earn money.

371
00:25:48,246 --> 00:25:50,544
You can say it's a world
of man-against-man.

372
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,443
Do you like baseball?

373
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,020
I hate it.

374
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:00,457
Oh, no,
let's not talk about baseball.

375
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:02,653
- Thank you for waiting.
- Thanks.

376
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,931
Please, eat up.

377
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,935
<i>Now I've hooked Kurita.</i>

378
00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:19,136
<i>Ippei Kyuki has been</i>
<i>pulled into my camp.</i>

379
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:24,476
<i>I have to babysit these two men</i>
<i>until the fall tournament is over.</i>

380
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:27,750
<i>But wait.</i>

381
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:30,116
<i>This girl is trouble.</i>

382
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,052
<i>She's like a chameleon.</i>

383
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:34,455
<i>What's going on in her mind?</i>

384
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:47,465
KURITA'S TRIPLE
UPSET VICTORY

385
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,372
THE METEORIC RISE
OF POWER HITTER KURITA

386
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:52,467
KURITA... MASTER
OF THE EXTRA BASE HIT

387
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,946
Well done, Kurita!

388
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:16,860
Hello.

389
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:21,266
Mr. Kyuki.

390
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:45,358
Hello?
Do you know where he's gone?

391
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,461
He's out?
He's really not there?

392
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,129
Yesterday, we promised to meet here.

393
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:54,603
I told you I didn't like baseball.

394
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,001
Even if he were here,
I wouldn't get him for you.

395
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,778
Please don't tease me like that.

396
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,178
I've been waiting for him
for two hours.

397
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:07,682
<i>What's so funny?</i>

398
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,680
Hello?

399
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,681
Damn it.

400
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:28,834
I don't lie.

401
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:30,771
He's been out since last night.

402
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,172
Really?

403
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,246
If you really don't believe me,
why don't you come by?

404
00:28:36,281 --> 00:28:38,272
We're at an inn.
You can spend the night.

405
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,043
1,500 yen a night.

406
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,138
- Reach.
- Reach?

407
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,571
Oh, my gosh.

408
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,199
- How about it?
- You're good.

409
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,301
You didn't steal it.

410
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,041
That's 9 wan.

411
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,343
I screwed up.

412
00:29:13,718 --> 00:29:15,015
I should've kept it.

413
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,247
Your time in the birthplace
of mahjong sure paid off.

414
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,118
Don't lose the game
to please me.

415
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:21,749
What are you saying?
There's money at stake here.

416
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,427
4-8-9-6.

417
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,325
Mr. Kyuki, a phone call for you.

418
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,092
Excuse me.

419
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:39,105
Watch yourself or you'll lose
your train fare home.

420
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:42,236
You're gonna pay me
for the day, right?

421
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,815
I've been playing mahjong
all night long.

422
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,907
My back hurts.

423
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,112
Okay, okay.
That's a problem.

424
00:29:50,655 --> 00:29:54,682
I'm busy now, meeting officials
from the Ministry of Agriculture.

425
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,227
Yeah. Yes, yes.

426
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,922
Anyway, I'm busy right now.
Talk to you later.

427
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:10,968
He's meeting officials from Agriculture,
trying to import chicken droppings.

428
00:30:11,075 --> 00:30:12,599
Chicken what?

429
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,075
Chicken shit.

430
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,376
Filthy.

431
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:21,210
Maybe he's lying
and meeting Kishimoto.

432
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:23,452
He can't be.

433
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:28,356
Wait. We're always fooling him.
He could be fooling us.

434
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,550
Idiot.

435
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,427
"TANl" INN

436
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:41,732
Hello.

437
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,471
Hello?
- Coming.

438
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:55,116
Welcome.

439
00:30:57,822 --> 00:30:59,255
You said to come, so I did.

440
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,756
Spending the night?

441
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,326
Miss Fueko...

442
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,855
Don't be so mean.

443
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:06,689
Let me see Mr. Kyuki.

444
00:31:06,798 --> 00:31:08,493
I told you he was out.

445
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,936
Why do you always
treat me like the enemy?

446
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:14,836
I'm sorry.

447
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,843
I act this way with everyone.

448
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,674
I guess I'm always on guard.

449
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,748
If you can't stand
seeing me, I'll leave.

450
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,384
Please tell me where he is.

451
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,443
This is a <i>gift</i> for you.

452
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,659
"Be wary of a man
who showers you with gifts."

453
00:31:36,761 --> 00:31:38,820
That's advice
from a women's magazine.

454
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,727
If you don't take it,
I'll leave it here.

455
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,595
I'll mail it back to you.

456
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:46,868
I can leave the postage.

457
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,892
Go! Faster!

458
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:28,141
I'm not a good gambler.
Let's call it a day.

459
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,582
What?
Don't lose heart.

460
00:32:33,351 --> 00:32:34,648
Here.

461
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,286
I put money on every horse.

462
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,829
If I don't win now,
I'd rather get stampeded.

463
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:54,662
I figure it's about time
I met Kurita's family.

464
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,873
What do you think?

465
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,442
You're right.

466
00:32:59,577 --> 00:33:01,044
Let's go together.

467
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:05,314
I hope I can take time off
from work.

468
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:08,045
I know you're quite busy.

469
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,248
The Ministry of Industry and Trade
is slow to grant permits.

470
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,325
I've been trying to import
fruit preserves from the US.

471
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,960
But...

472
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:20,721
Mr. Kyuki.

473
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,633
You know very well
I'm crazy about Kurita.

474
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:28,062
Can I get Kurita or not?

475
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:33,502
Signing him
is the challenge of a lifetime.

476
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,375
Mr. Kishimoto.

477
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:40,616
Will you buy me
along with him?

478
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:45,950
I will buy you.

479
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:52,728
I'm back.

480
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,161
Welcome home.

481
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,904
Any phone calls?

482
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,166
Mr. Furukawa and Mr. Shima.

483
00:34:04,842 --> 00:34:07,037
They said they were
going back to Osaka.

484
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,442
They did?

485
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,879
They always call us
at about the same time.

486
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,812
Is it going well?

487
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:15,977
What?

488
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,250
Don't play dumb.
I'm talking about your "lottery" sales.

489
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:20,756
I'm going to Shikoku tomorrow.

490
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,223
I'll go with you.

491
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:24,851
- Now I have a leech of my own?
- I won't let you go.

492
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:37,604
This is from my team's director.

493
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,433
What is it?

494
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:41,307
It's not much,
but please use it.

495
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,381
I had no idea
what to bring as <i>gifts.</i>

496
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:47,849
I see.
I'll hold onto it for you.

497
00:34:58,529 --> 00:34:59,860
Get off!

498
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:05,900
When the time comes,
please consider our team.

499
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,806
We have no say in the matter.

500
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,934
We'll ask Mr. Kyuki to handle it.
Right?

501
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:16,806
Is this really for real?

502
00:35:16,914 --> 00:35:21,544
Before, I used to think baseball
was just a children's game.

503
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,950
You'll have an easy life now.

504
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,751
You're lucky to have
such a good son.

505
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,018
All thanks to you, Mr. Kyuki.

506
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,596
Thank you very much
for everything.

507
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,766
<i>Boss, people are so naive</i>
<i>in the countryside.</i>

508
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,462
<i>They're not greedy.</i>

509
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:42,630
<i>Their souls are as pure</i>
<i>as the country air.</i>

510
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,538
<i>We can point them</i>
<i>in any direction we want.</i>

511
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,411
Been a while, huh?

512
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:59,887
I got your letter.
I'm afraid I'm on duty today.

513
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,888
You totally look the part.
A first engineer?

514
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:06,395
A first engineer
with no second engineer.

515
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,096
This is Mr. Kishimoto
with the Toyo Flowers.

516
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:13,030
Kurita's older brother.

517
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,530
Nice to meet you.

518
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:21,041
I'm Shiro Kurita.
I hear you've been good to my brother.

519
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,271
Not at all.

520
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,506
A nylon jacket.
It's popular these days.

521
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,448
Wow, great.

522
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:29,815
Kurita!

523
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,618
- Excuse me.
- It's fine. Go on.

524
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:36,417
See you.

525
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:46,459
Kurita trusts him the most
of all his siblings.

526
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:47,765
I see.

527
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:50,531
He's a cheerful, pleasant man.

528
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:58,375
<i>This man is very understanding, Boss.</i>

529
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,610
<i>He's honest and ordinary.</i>

530
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,413
<i>I wish our man Kyuki was like him.</i>

531
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,365
Please.

532
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,701
He can do what he loves
and make a good living at it.

533
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,135
He couldn't be more
fortunate in life.

534
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,973
It paid off to give him up
and put him under your care.

535
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:31,907
We are half brothers,
though from different mothers.

536
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:36,180
Goro's got a fighting spirit.
I knew he'd be good at sports.

537
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:38,415
Stubborn, isn't he?

538
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:42,787
That made it all the more worth it
for me to train him.

539
00:37:43,461 --> 00:37:45,190
It was hard, though.

540
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,591
Thank you for everything, Mr. Kyuki.

541
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,564
Please watch over him
in the future.

542
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,136
<i>He looks like a good man.</i>

543
00:37:57,675 --> 00:38:00,200
<i>Yes, he's Kurita's</i>
<i>second oldest brother.</i>

544
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,914
<i>Used to be an intellectual.</i>
<i>Easy to talk to.</i>

545
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,779
<i>His real-world smarts?</i>
<i>I'd say, "zero."</i>

546
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,315
Mr. Kyuki, what's wrong?

547
00:38:11,422 --> 00:38:13,185
Come on, Ryoko.
Get a doctor.

548
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,451
Call Dr. Nakayama.

549
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,658
- Mr. Kyuki.
- Dear.

550
00:38:28,939 --> 00:38:30,736
I'm Tamekichi Kurita.

551
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,138
Nice to meet you.

552
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:35,706
I'm with the Toyo Flowers.
My name is Kishimoto.

553
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,377
Mr. Kyuki was
supposed to come with me.

554
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:42,215
But he suddenly fell ill, so...

555
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,816
- You want to talk about Goro?
- Yes.

556
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:50,324
I saw someone else the other day.

557
00:38:52,763 --> 00:38:55,163
He was with the Handen Lilies.

558
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,233
Mr. Shima?

559
00:38:58,202 --> 00:39:00,568
So you want to buy Goro, too?

560
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,868
Yes.
As a matter of fact...

561
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,067
This is whiskey for you.

562
00:39:08,145 --> 00:39:09,635
It's nothing much, but...

563
00:39:10,314 --> 00:39:11,713
I'll take it.

564
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,148
Come watch the dogs fight.

565
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,344
Sure...

566
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:20,347
<i>He's the one, Boss.</i>

567
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,788
<i>He's gonna cost us money.</i>

568
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:27,058
<i>Kurita's oldest brother</i>
<i>is no pushover.</i>

569
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:29,857
<i>Yep. He's like Godzilla.</i>

570
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,193
<i>A real piece of work.</i>

571
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,767
<i>I wish we didn't have to</i>
<i>deal with his kind.</i>

572
00:39:42,913 --> 00:39:45,404
I troubled you with my illness
right at the crucial moment.

573
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,951
But it went well, didn't it?

574
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:49,851
I think so.

575
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:55,619
Mr. Kyuki, the Handen team
has already reached Kurita's family.

576
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:57,455
Handen has?

577
00:39:58,696 --> 00:39:59,856
I see.

578
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,524
Mr. Kishimoto.

579
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:06,059
I wanna stop by the university hospital.
May I excuse myself in Osaka?

580
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,660
Please go ahead.

581
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,674
If you're going in for surgery,
please contact our Osaka office.

582
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,607
We'll do our best
to accommodate you.

583
00:40:17,882 --> 00:40:19,747
- Hi.
- Welcome, sir.

584
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,387
This way, please.

585
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,184
Please.

586
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:30,726
Sorry to keep you waiting.

587
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,493
I'm here in Osaka on business.

588
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,895
Well, thank you.

589
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,762
Thank you for your call.

590
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,263
Please accept a handbag.

591
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,840
For me?

592
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:47,537
A handbag for
a cheap phone call?

593
00:40:47,645 --> 00:40:51,342
I'm borrowing Mr. Kyuki for an hour.
You'll be taken to a fun place.

594
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,939
By a handsome guide.

595
00:40:54,485 --> 00:40:57,682
You're getting quite close
to Kishimoto with the Toyo Flowers.

596
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,416
That's the rumor.

597
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,254
There's no truth to it.
That's a false rumor.

598
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,260
I do hope it's a false rumor.

599
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:09,664
The Toyo Flowers don't have
the money to get the big boys.

600
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:14,261
Their director Shiraishi is sharp, but
he's got no credibility within his team.

601
00:41:14,371 --> 00:41:15,531
I know that.

602
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:20,871
I want to consider
Kurita's future carefully.

603
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,913
All the more reason
to want him on our team.

604
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:27,450
We're prepared to accept
any terms you propose.

605
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:30,720
I hear you visited Kurita's family.

606
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,382
Well, no, it's not like
we ignored you.

607
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,517
I just stopped by to say hello.

608
00:41:37,561 --> 00:41:40,325
Let me tell you what we think.

609
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,793
At this point, that is.

610
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:46,934
Kurita's contract should be
four million yen, up front.

611
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:50,907
We'd like to pay you
a one-million-yen finder's fee.

612
00:41:51,008 --> 00:41:53,636
Don't worry about me.
I just want...

613
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,837
Of course,
that's not our final offer.

614
00:41:55,946 --> 00:42:00,042
Would you leave Kurita alone
until <i>after</i> the fall tournament?

615
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:05,952
Good evening.

616
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,523
Good evening.

617
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,923
I just offered him
four million and one million.

618
00:42:10,461 --> 00:42:11,792
That's too little.

619
00:42:12,663 --> 00:42:15,131
I told you five million and 1.5.

620
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,860
I can't budge
even if you said 10 million.

621
00:42:17,968 --> 00:42:20,596
Anyway, please wait
until <i>after</i> the fall tournament.

622
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:23,537
I understand.

623
00:42:24,174 --> 00:42:27,200
I'm a silly man.
I always want to rush to a conclusion.

624
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:32,538
Please.

625
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:34,581
Get some geishas.

626
00:42:34,685 --> 00:42:36,152
Sounds good.

627
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,915
That reminds me.

628
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:42,391
You know Iwamoto,
from Kumano High? We got him.

629
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,654
That's a big coup.

630
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,265
I gave his leech a taste of candy.

631
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,200
A walk in the park.
Wasn't it?

632
00:42:56,273 --> 00:43:00,039
We'd better tell him soon.
He's a greedy bastard.

633
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:02,840
If you mean to propose
a million, say 1.1 million.

634
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:05,108
If you mean 2 million, say 2.2.

635
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:08,946
Be generous with his finder's fee.
Even one yen more is better.

636
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:10,987
How about this for Kurita?

637
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:13,318
You might wanna add
one more finger.

638
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:16,449
We're talking about an auction here.

639
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,857
Here he comes.

640
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:23,730
Japan Airlines Flight 102, leaving at 8:00
for Tokyo, is ready for boarding.

641
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:27,667
- Hello.
- You're late, Mr. Kyuki.

642
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,068
Here are your tickets.

643
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:32,006
Thank you.
I'm taking advantage of your kindness.

644
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,704
Come off it, aren't we friends?
This way, will you?

645
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,281
Please.

646
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:42,852
Let's talk about the terms.
I'll be blunt.

647
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:46,184
1.55 million for you.
6.5 million for Kurita.

648
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:50,220
I'm just getting started.
If that's not enough, we'll raise it.

649
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,591
They say we Osakans
are quick to add more, right?

650
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:54,687
Yes. Please consider us.

651
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,290
I'll keep it in mind.

652
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:02,135
Excuse me.

653
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:08,341
What?

654
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:17,645
KURITA HOSPITALIZED
WITH APPENDICITIS

655
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,365
He's just fallen asleep.

656
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,202
It's fine if I don't see him.

657
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,307
I'm relieved to hear
he's doing well.

658
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,933
Thank you very much.

659
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,773
It's a portable radio.

660
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:46,474
I figure he must be bored.

661
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,044
I'll give it to Kurita later.

662
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:53,689
Give him my regards.

663
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:11,334
Mr. Kishimoto.

664
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,343
I have a favor to ask.

665
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,140
What is it?

666
00:45:17,347 --> 00:45:21,784
Please stop trying
to lure Kurita into pro baseball.

667
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,119
Why?

668
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:30,950
He's completely changed from
when he first showed up from Shikoku.

669
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,421
What do you mean by that?

670
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,560
It's because you and Kyuki
are trying to take advantage of him.

671
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,334
You're eager for your own fame.

672
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:46,773
Kyuki is...
- Wait a moment.

673
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:51,336
Kurita needs to decide for himself
if he wants to play pro baseball.

674
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,973
Don't accuse me
of taking advantage of him.

675
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,915
What right do you have
to interfere with Kurita's future?

676
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,490
It's because I love him.

677
00:46:06,830 --> 00:46:10,994
Isn't that all the more reason
for you to think about his future?

678
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,865
What's wrong with
professional baseball?

679
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:17,604
I don't need to explain that to you.

680
00:46:18,642 --> 00:46:22,510
All I'm asking is that
you stop trying to recruit him.

681
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:26,440
But that's my profession.
I can't stop.

682
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,821
I don't trust Ippei Kyuki.

683
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:36,047
He's ambitious, so he won't
stay with my company long.

684
00:46:36,593 --> 00:46:39,528
As I said before, he's got
one million yen from Handen.

685
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,758
- Mr. Ohgushi, Mr. Kyuki is...
- He's like that.

686
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,261
You trust people.

687
00:46:45,369 --> 00:46:47,360
That's a very noble virtue these days.

688
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,905
But first you must look at the man.

689
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:54,704
I can tell you now,
when he was in China, he was a spy.

690
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,904
A spy?

691
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:58,209
He was working for the enemy.

692
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,121
Hello? Yeah?

693
00:47:06,957 --> 00:47:08,151
It's Kyuki.

694
00:47:09,092 --> 00:47:11,060
Yeah. Yeah.

695
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,129
What? Huh?

696
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:15,893
Yeah. Fine.

697
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:19,968
He just got back from Osaka.
He's at the hospital.

698
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:21,901
Is he coming here?

699
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,838
- He said he wanted to quit.
- Quit your company?

700
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:29,345
Kishimoto, he wants to start
his own trading company.

701
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,311
Once he's got tons of money.

702
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,014
FROM: MIYOKO KYUKI
KOJIMA, OKAYAMA

703
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:38,919
I feel so refreshed.

704
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,323
Hot, isn't it?

705
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,391
You got a letter
from someone you like.

706
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:54,264
- A bill from a bar?
- Yes, from Okayama.

707
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:56,233
Where is it?

708
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:00,810
Didn't you see your wife in Osaka?

709
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:03,038
Don't be silly.
Did I have time?

710
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:05,080
How the hell should I know?

711
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:07,047
You always cover your tracks.

712
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,412
Thanks to the war.

713
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,043
It's who you are.
It's in your nature.

714
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,485
You scare me.

715
00:48:13,190 --> 00:48:16,523
You're fine when the gig's going well.
When it's not, you're finished.

716
00:48:16,627 --> 00:48:19,528
What will you do if it goes badly?
- I have no idea.

717
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,021
You don't want to know.

718
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,063
When you start to miss someone,
you just can't take it.

719
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,296
If anything happened to us...
- Don't say it.

720
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,834
You'll miss your wife and kids
in Okayama someday.

721
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:33,341
It's all in your head.

722
00:48:33,877 --> 00:48:36,675
I know very well
what you're scheming.

723
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:41,210
Think you can get rich
and leave me? Not a chance!

724
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:45,015
Come on.
Are you jealous?

725
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:48,524
You're being ridiculous...

726
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:49,887
Ouch.

727
00:48:49,993 --> 00:48:54,760
Excuse me. Mr. Kishimoto
with the Toyo Flowers is here.

728
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,332
Show him in.
I'll be right there.

729
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,491
Yes, sir.

730
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,629
I'll do right by you
when I'm rich.

731
00:49:01,738 --> 00:49:04,036
One day you'll appreciate
what a great man I am.

732
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:05,768
Don't be surprised.

733
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,006
What's the word
from Okayama?

734
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:10,807
So you do care.

735
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,416
I was lying about the letter.

736
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,919
Huh. You...

737
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:23,955
So what was the result
of your physical?

738
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:26,796
They took an X-ray.

739
00:49:27,597 --> 00:49:30,566
They said I had to have an operation.

740
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,096
- Good evening.
- Please.

741
00:49:37,341 --> 00:49:41,641
I got a good medication for you.
I brought it with me.

742
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:42,905
What is it?

743
00:49:43,013 --> 00:49:44,742
Raccoon liver.

744
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,276
They say it does wonders
for gallstones.

745
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:50,114
Do me a favor and poison him.

746
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:52,848
My, you're quite upset.

747
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:55,692
Can I use your phone?

748
00:49:55,792 --> 00:49:57,350
Go ahead.
It's on the front desk.

749
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:01,557
Excuse me.

750
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:10,267
Raccoon liver for a fox like you?
He's so gullible.

751
00:50:17,147 --> 00:50:18,637
He'll be back soon.

752
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,480
"Dear Director Shiraishi.

753
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:28,090
Kyuki is a trustworthy person.

754
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,585
He is our only ally."

755
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:37,660
He trusts you completely.
Doesn't feel bad, does it?

756
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:39,793
He's a sly fox.

757
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:45,872
Not a bad trick at all.
You did well.

758
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:48,308
If he's a spy,
I'll have to be a guerrilla.

759
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,607
I'll shoot him down
with a wad of cash.

760
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,748
<i>Under the sky with white clouds</i>

761
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,921
<i>Passionate young men gather</i>

762
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:10,058
<i>Our battle cry</i>

763
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:14,498
<i>Rings out</i>

764
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:18,096
<i>The crown of victory</i>

765
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:22,408
<i>Always belongs to us</i>

766
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:26,312
<i>We shall fight...</i>

767
00:51:29,286 --> 00:51:32,414
GAME-ENDING HOME RUN
11th INNING, KURITA

768
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:37,192
DRAMATIC 11th-INNING HOMER
BY KURITA OF SYOWA UNIVERSITY

769
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:46,736
OSAKA SOCKS

770
00:51:46,837 --> 00:51:48,896
Mr. Sakata, it's outrageous.

771
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:52,497
The press is abuzz.
Kishimoto gave Kyuki one million yen.

772
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:53,803
This sounds like the real deal.

773
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,344
He seems carefree and innocent,
but he's shrewd and cunning.

774
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,038
What's Kurita's schedule?

775
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,207
He's a piece of work, too.

776
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,376
- Kurita's schedule.
- Sure.

777
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,573
It appears Kishimoto outsmarted us.

778
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,541
- What? Outsmarted us?
- Yes.

779
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,943
Something was fishy,
so I went to the trading company.

780
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:34,473
Turns out Kyuki quit a long time ago.

781
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:37,043
Right away,
I went to see Kishimoto.

782
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,954
I tried to grill him,
but he was just grinning.

783
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:45,223
He wouldn't grin like that
unless he was confident.

784
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:48,297
Idiot. How can you give up
just because of that?

785
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,933
We'll settle this in Shikoku.

786
00:52:51,735 --> 00:52:53,430
Fly to Shikoku now.

787
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:55,300
Make his family shut out Kyuki.

788
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:59,501
You've been on a spending spree.
What'll you do if we don't get him?

789
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,538
I don't have a license
to print money.

790
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,048
I don't have a tree
with money growing on it.

791
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,542
My authority has its limits.

792
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,450
I'm prepared to do anything.

793
00:53:12,989 --> 00:53:14,752
You can resign if you want,

794
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,655
but that won't give us
the money we need.

795
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,902
I don't dislike baseball.

796
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:37,146
I dislike the people around you.
They're greedy and selfish.

797
00:53:37,247 --> 00:53:39,181
Every profession
comes with people like that.

798
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:43,079
I wonder where you
<i>left</i> behind your old self.

799
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,152
All those headlines
have rewritten your true character.

800
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,189
Remember what
you told me once?

801
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,526
"I'm happy I get to study at college.

802
00:53:57,567 --> 00:54:00,035
I want an ordinary, honest life."

803
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:03,698
Fueko, come out and tell me
if you don't like me anymore.

804
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:08,073
"You're a coward."
Isn't that what you want to tell me?

805
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:17,248
I'm not asking you to be responsible
just because we kissed once or twice.

806
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,514
I love baseball.

807
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,184
You've become famous.

808
00:54:23,627 --> 00:54:25,492
I was an illegitimate child.

809
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:28,756
It's no use beating yourself up.

810
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,501
While you spoil yourself

811
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:35,003
now that you've increased in value.

812
00:54:35,972 --> 00:54:38,873
Fueko, you're telling me
to quit baseball.

813
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,001
I'm not telling you to quit.

814
00:54:42,612 --> 00:54:44,477
Just don't become a shark.

815
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:48,076
Don't accept <i>gifts</i> without reason.

816
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,015
Tell that to Mr. Kyuki.

817
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:53,021
I'm still a student.
What can I do?

818
00:54:55,659 --> 00:54:57,251
You're using them.

819
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:00,455
You just pretend you're being used
by Kishimoto and Kyuki.

820
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:06,761
This week will determine my fate.

821
00:55:07,604 --> 00:55:08,730
Take a look.

822
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,372
Your letter of resignation?
You're really determined.

823
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:25,910
Tell me if you've gotten final offers
from the other teams.

824
00:55:28,124 --> 00:55:31,287
The Osaka Socks say
100,000 yen a month.

825
00:55:31,394 --> 00:55:33,294
Seven million yen, up front.

826
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,328
The Handen offer
is about the same.

827
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:38,901
No, I'm asking about your pay.

828
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,806
I think you're essential.

829
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,604
Without you,
Kurita the player wouldn't exist.

830
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,980
Don't worry about me.

831
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:54,583
Please tell me.

832
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:58,479
There's a rumor that
I gave you two million.

833
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:04,219
The Osaka Socks said 2.5 million.

834
00:56:04,794 --> 00:56:06,489
What a bunch of jokers.

835
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:09,690
- And your business funds?
- They'd consider it a separate item.

836
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:11,096
That's all?

837
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,099
The Osaka Socks think you're cheap.

838
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:20,466
I've been thinking
three million for you.

839
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:23,469
For Kurita, eight million yen.

840
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:26,309
120,000 yen a month.

841
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,644
The team director
Shiraishi has agreed.

842
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:31,220
I appreciate that.

843
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,982
Can we sign him in Tokyo?

844
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:39,155
I think you'd better go
to Shikoku one more time.

845
00:56:40,630 --> 00:56:43,827
When the championship is over,
Kurita will go back to Shikoku.

846
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:46,060
Then we'll sign him in Shikoku?

847
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:48,331
Probably.

848
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:04,813
Mr. Kyuki, you'd better have surgery
once the contract is signed.

849
00:57:05,655 --> 00:57:07,350
Let me make arrangements.

850
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:09,188
Thank you.

851
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,755
You're the only one
who's concerned about my health.

852
00:57:14,998 --> 00:57:16,192
Seriously.

853
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,869
I got him, Boss.
We have the final offers.

854
00:57:27,977 --> 00:57:28,944
How much?

855
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:32,674
Eight million up front, three million
to Kyuki, 120,000 yen a month.

856
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:35,842
- It's gone up, huh?
- It's too late to back down.

857
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,886
- We have him for sure?
- 90%

858
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:39,888
We're the highest bidder.

859
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,423
Fine. Contact the manager.

860
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:43,787
When can we sign him?

861
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:47,351
Let me see. <i>After</i> the fall championship
closing ceremony on the 16th.

862
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,727
I'm leaving for Shikoku now.

863
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,461
Good.
Be very careful around his family.

864
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:57,233
"Our son Goro's future shall be
determined <i>after</i> due consideration.

865
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,969
Not only I, his father, but
his four siblings will be his counsel.

866
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:05,544
We request that you not interfere
with Goro ever again."

867
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:10,678
Ryoko. Ryoko!

868
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:17,085
KURITA SIGNING WAR
FINAL STAGE

869
00:58:17,193 --> 00:58:18,820
HERO GOES TO WHICH TEAM?

870
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:42,718
We sent a letter to Kyuki, from our father,
clearly forbidding his involvement.

871
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:44,283
What do you mean?

872
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:48,380
Goro's future will be
discussed among ourselves.

873
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,592
I heard what I think is a false rumor.

874
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,127
It's not just a rumor.

875
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,797
What is it?

876
00:58:55,899 --> 00:59:00,700
Kyuki's taking advantage of our brother
and enjoying the honey, they say.

877
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:02,666
I heard that one, too.

878
00:59:02,772 --> 00:59:06,765
For example, they say Kyuki got
a million yen from the Osaka Socks.

879
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,876
That's completely untrue.
Don't believe the rumors. Poor Kyuki.

880
00:59:12,815 --> 00:59:15,841
I hate to say it, but I heard it
from the editor of the <i>Sports Mirror.</i>

881
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:18,614
That's completely unethical.

882
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,155
How can the newspaper
talk up a baseless rumor?

883
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:23,248
There's no proof
the rumors are false.

884
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,493
We country folks
always end up losing out.

885
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:27,961
Wait a moment.

886
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:30,193
I've also heard rumors.

887
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:34,327
His parents decided on the Ticks
so they could build a new house.

888
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:38,965
His brother got half a million
from Handen.

889
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:41,532
You gotta be kidding.

890
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:44,905
What good would it do
if I took money?

891
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,481
How dare you spread falsehoods!

892
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:53,553
Once the fall championship is over,
I'll pay you another visit.

893
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,824
Please accept a <i>gift.</i>

894
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:14,840
Where have you been?
I even called the dormitory.

895
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:19,777
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were ill.

896
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:23,612
Soon you'll be leaving college.

897
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,921
What are you going to do?

898
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:29,651
Well, I'd like to visit
my family one more time.

899
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:36,757
Thanks to you, Mr. Kyuki,
I can go out into the world.

900
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:41,835
I've been lucky
to have a good teacher.

901
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,566
I'm glad to hear that.

902
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,270
I couldn't do much for you.

903
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:53,983
The best I can do now is select
a good team for your future.

904
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:56,275
Thank you very much.

905
01:00:56,919 --> 01:01:00,878
I'd like to sign up with a team
with a good manager.

906
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,355
Sounds good.

907
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:08,427
That reminds me, Mr. Kishimoto
wanted you to meet his team's manager.

908
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,765
Why don't we meet him once
before you go back to Shikoku?

909
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:13,996
Sure.

910
01:01:14,103 --> 01:01:18,005
That team's manager is young,
but I think he's quite good.

911
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:24,302
Mr. Kyuki,
I have a favor to ask.

912
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,482
What is it?

913
01:01:26,582 --> 01:01:30,643
I had a fight with Fueko.

914
01:01:31,187 --> 01:01:32,313
That's why...

915
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,083
You couldn't come here.

916
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,682
Yes. I came today
because I heard she was out.

917
01:01:41,497 --> 01:01:43,328
What are you going to do?

918
01:01:45,001 --> 01:01:48,732
I think my relationship with her
was a mistake from the beginning.

919
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:51,406
Am I a coward?

920
01:01:52,075 --> 01:01:54,600
Don't worry about it. Okay?

921
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,009
I've raised you
for the last four years.

922
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:00,172
Leave everything to me, will you?

923
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,581
Please.

924
01:02:03,386 --> 01:02:08,346
I'd be a peasant in Shikoku now
if you hadn't taken me under your wing.

925
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:11,025
I'll never forget
how indebted I am to you.

926
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,399
<i>You trust people.</i>

927
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,869
<i>That's a very noble virtue these days.</i>

928
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:25,236
<i>But first you must look at the man.</i>

929
01:02:25,341 --> 01:02:29,641
<i>I can tell you now,</i>
<i>when he was in China, Kyuki was a spy.</i>

930
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:35,775
I can't trust people anymore.
I need proof.

931
01:02:35,885 --> 01:02:37,375
What do you want me to do?

932
01:02:37,487 --> 01:02:39,114
Stop conning me.

933
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:44,085
I've done my sincere best
for you and Kurita.

934
01:02:45,128 --> 01:02:47,153
I'm not complaining.
It's my job.

935
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:50,632
But, Mr. Kyuki,
you're sly and <i>crafty.</i>

936
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:53,258
- You calling me a fox?
- A fox can't outsmart humans.

937
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,928
Why did you hide it that Kurita's family
sent you a cease-and-desist letter?

938
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,670
Did you lose their confidence?

939
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:04,136
If it's over, tell me.

940
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,738
Then why don't you back out?

941
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,580
Don't toy with my weakness.

942
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:13,854
Let's treat each other
with human decency.

943
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:17,724
You may find it laughable
to hear me say this.

944
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,431
Of course until today
I've been suspicious of you.

945
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:24,793
I planned to use you.

946
01:03:26,369 --> 01:03:31,932
But when I went to Shikoku this time,
I got a slap in the face.

947
01:03:33,576 --> 01:03:36,545
Kurita's brothers had changed,
they were without scruple.

948
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,816
I thought about it
on the plane home.

949
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:49,258
Every person has a moment in his life
when he can't trust anyone.

950
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:54,525
I thought I'd grown weak.

951
01:03:56,432 --> 01:04:00,425
But now I want to try
to be decent to others.

952
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:05,362
If it's over, please tell me.
I'll back out right away.

953
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,674
I don't want to think
you were conning me.

954
01:04:13,816 --> 01:04:18,185
My job seems pathetic to me now.
I can't stand it.

955
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:23,452
We do bring pleasure to the fans
by finding good players.

956
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,925
It's a fine profession in that regard.

957
01:04:28,064 --> 01:04:31,090
But our behavior
towards other people is...

958
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,363
Ugly and lowdown.

959
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:40,503
You've acknowledged it.
So what?

960
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:46,113
It's our job to be ruthless
and unaccountable.

961
01:04:47,683 --> 01:04:52,814
Because we see people like Kurita,
not as players, but as commodities.

962
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,994
Because we see people like you
not as human beings, but as leeches.

963
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,364
That's the truth.

964
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,060
So we try to resolve
everything with money.

965
01:05:05,167 --> 01:05:06,134
Mr. Kishimoto.

966
01:05:08,471 --> 01:05:11,634
It's not just greed and money
between Kurita and me.

967
01:05:13,676 --> 01:05:16,770
We've worked together,
drenched in sweat, for four years.

968
01:05:16,879 --> 01:05:18,244
I'm aware of that.

969
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:22,744
That's why I want to show you
some human decency.

970
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,587
Maybe it's just a cheap sentimentality.

971
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:29,219
You can go ahead and laugh at me.

972
01:05:35,364 --> 01:05:36,524
Look at this.

973
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,333
It's a pledge
Kurita's parents wrote to me.

974
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:47,000
"Goro Kurita's future decisions
are entrusted to Mr. Kyuki."

975
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,511
Mr. Kishimoto.

976
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,016
Please trust me.

977
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:19,966
SYOWA SCORES COMPLETE SHUTOUT
KURITA AGAIN LEADING HITTER

978
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:24,279
SCOUTS CONVERGE ON KURITA
THE SYOWA U. SLUGGER

979
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,116
TEAMS FIGHT OVER NEW PLAYERS

980
01:06:35,224 --> 01:06:36,748
Congratulations.

981
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,019
Thanks.

982
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,523
The watch, as promised.

983
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,394
Thank you.

984
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,492
We'd like to make
the final decision in Shikoku.

985
01:06:48,070 --> 01:06:51,005
This is what Kurita himself wants.

986
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:53,905
Don't quit running
when you're in Shikoku.

987
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,204
Yes, Coach.

988
01:06:56,212 --> 01:07:00,046
Now please confirm the terms
of our team's offer.

989
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:04,180
Eight million yen up front.
160,000 yen a month.

990
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,090
Am I worth that much?

991
01:07:08,791 --> 01:07:10,258
It makes me nervous.

992
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:14,354
Just focus on hitting those home runs.
Soon you'll say, "This isn't enough."

993
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:19,391
That's right. Your skill at the bat
drove up these numbers.

994
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:22,394
I almost forgot
something important.

995
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:25,332
It's about Mr. Kyuki.

996
01:07:26,008 --> 01:07:27,202
Listen, Kurita.

997
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,710
Let's say you join our team.

998
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:35,111
We'd like Mr. Kyuki
to work for our team, too.

999
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,275
Is that right?

1000
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:37,682
Of course.

1001
01:07:38,354 --> 01:07:39,946
Think about it.

1002
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:42,921
What time is your train tonight?

1003
01:07:43,025 --> 01:07:45,118
It's the <i>Seto,</i>
leaving at 10:30.

1004
01:07:47,096 --> 01:07:50,259
I can't be seen with you at the station.
Have a safe trip back.

1005
01:07:50,866 --> 01:07:52,333
Give my regards to your brothers.

1006
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:57,496
It's not much, but this is for the trip.
It's from my director.

1007
01:07:57,606 --> 01:07:58,868
I can't take it.

1008
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,202
Take it.

1009
01:08:01,544 --> 01:08:03,569
Pull over right there.

1010
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:04,805
Okay.

1011
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,109
Take this cab.
You must have baggage.

1012
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:10,512
I'm getting out, too.
I'll meet you at Tokyo Station.

1013
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:12,987
Accept his offer and take this cab.

1014
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,233
- I'll see you in Shikoku.
- See you then.

1015
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:34,003
Did you see the nice suit he was wearing?
I bought it for him.

1016
01:08:35,411 --> 01:08:37,606
I'm flying to Shikoku
the day <i>after</i> tomorrow.

1017
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,506
What about you?

1018
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,245
I'll be there a day <i>after</i> you.

1019
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,377
I'm not feeling too good.

1020
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:49,379
I hope you're not coming
with another team.

1021
01:08:49,492 --> 01:08:51,187
Don't doubt me anymore.

1022
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:54,727
You want to know
what my true intentions are.

1023
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:56,991
And I want to find out
what's in Kurita's heart.

1024
01:08:58,868 --> 01:09:02,065
This is my last chance.

1025
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,267
You still don't trust me.

1026
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:09,537
I can tell.

1027
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:12,581
Don't worry now.

1028
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,842
My fate is bound to yours now.

1029
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,450
I believe in you.

1030
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:25,157
Mr. Kishimoto.

1031
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,295
I've got one last favor to ask.

1032
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,831
Right now,
Fueko is waiting for me.

1033
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:37,497
I promised her
she'd see Kurita today.

1034
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,631
You want me to see her?

1035
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,073
Please.

1036
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:46,814
As you may know,
Fueko and Kurita are...

1037
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,543
In love, aren't they?

1038
01:09:49,385 --> 01:09:51,319
He wants to break up with her.

1039
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,368
How have you been?

1040
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:18,110
I'm here because
Mr. Kyuki asked me to come.

1041
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,772
You don't need to say it.

1042
01:10:21,550 --> 01:10:24,212
Kurita is leaving for Shikoku tonight,
isn't he?

1043
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:26,681
He is.

1044
01:10:28,257 --> 01:10:32,591
You'd stoop to anything
if it helped you to close the deal.

1045
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:36,324
Fine.

1046
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,394
I had only one word to say to Kurita.

1047
01:10:41,670 --> 01:10:43,103
"Coward."

1048
01:10:45,341 --> 01:10:46,399
May I sit down?

1049
01:10:47,276 --> 01:10:48,072
I'm leaving.

1050
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:53,242
Watch out!

1051
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:57,817
Thank you.

1052
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,911
You're kind,
as suits your profession.

1053
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,357
May I take you somewhere?

1054
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,451
Are you trying to console me?

1055
01:11:08,063 --> 01:11:09,758
You misjudge me.

1056
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,467
No. I shouldn't.

1057
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:17,369
It has nothing to do with you.

1058
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,738
You may be right.

1059
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,311
Maybe I misjudged you.

1060
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,512
Maybe I confused you
with your occupation.

1061
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:30,884
That's enough.

1062
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,155
Why are you so upset?

1063
01:11:38,327 --> 01:11:40,852
You think Kyuki is a gentleman.

1064
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,925
I don't distrust people
from the very start like you do.

1065
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:48,859
You can't understand
until you've been betrayed.

1066
01:11:52,675 --> 01:11:54,006
Mr. Kishimoto.

1067
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,702
Kyuki is faking his illness.

1068
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:59,144
What? He's faking it?

1069
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:03,378
Sometimes.
Half the time, he's acting.

1070
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:34,312
Why are you staring at me?

1071
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:37,382
'Cause you pity me?

1072
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,020
You've resented me.

1073
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,455
I don't resent anyone.

1074
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:49,927
It's actually comical.

1075
01:12:51,066 --> 01:12:52,294
You mean, I am?

1076
01:12:52,401 --> 01:12:53,891
Both you and Kyuki.

1077
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:57,567
What in the hell is baseball anyway?

1078
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:02,304
In your world...

1079
01:13:02,978 --> 01:13:04,969
You buy and sell people.

1080
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:08,149
It's socially condoned
human trafficking.

1081
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,619
Were you really
in love with Kurita?

1082
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,729
A long, long time ago.

1083
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,098
Shall we dance?

1084
01:13:33,542 --> 01:13:34,509
Why?

1085
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:36,744
Are you bored?

1086
01:13:40,449 --> 01:13:42,474
Can't you dance without a reason?

1087
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,025
I used to be much more
innocent and sincere.

1088
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,528
Mr. Kishimoto.

1089
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:58,292
You know why I fell for Kurita?

1090
01:14:00,636 --> 01:14:03,104
There was something pure about him.

1091
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,197
Almost like greens
fresh out of the garden.

1092
01:14:07,910 --> 01:14:10,071
That's what I adored.

1093
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:13,438
You wanna know why?

1094
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,145
My mother was a mistress.

1095
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:19,982
She had two patrons.

1096
01:14:22,024 --> 01:14:26,222
That could mean
my sister and I...

1097
01:14:27,396 --> 01:14:29,694
Maybe we're not real sisters.

1098
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:35,363
My sister married once,
but it failed.

1099
01:14:37,272 --> 01:14:38,705
Then she met Kyuki...

1100
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:40,434
Stop it.

1101
01:14:40,542 --> 01:14:42,339
Why are you telling me this?

1102
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:47,713
The blood in my veins is dirty.
I can't bear it.

1103
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:54,083
I pity my mother,
but I can't forgive her.

1104
01:14:57,392 --> 01:14:58,882
I only wanted...

1105
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:04,427
a boring, honest marriage
to get away from home.

1106
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:05,659
Fueko.

1107
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:08,596
Stop right there.

1108
01:15:11,139 --> 01:15:12,333
You're right.

1109
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:16,206
I'm sorry I went to pieces.

1110
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,409
Let's dance.

1111
01:15:40,235 --> 01:15:41,463
Thank you.

1112
01:15:44,940 --> 01:15:49,104
Mr. Kishimoto not only financed my
business, but also found me a job.

1113
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:52,545
You know what
I've given up for you.

1114
01:15:52,648 --> 01:15:55,811
I quit my job and lost income.
Think about it.

1115
01:15:55,918 --> 01:15:57,317
I'm well aware of it.

1116
01:15:58,053 --> 01:16:00,385
When you get there,
watch out for your brothers.

1117
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,114
Why do they want to cut me off?

1118
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,352
If there's any other reason
than the rumors, let me know.

1119
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:06,791
I will.

1120
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:08,760
One more thing
to warn you about.

1121
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:12,262
Your interests may clash
with your brothers'.

1122
01:16:13,135 --> 01:16:16,036
You may need to pretend
to sever your ties.

1123
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,439
This is about my life.
I'll think it through for myself.

1124
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,336
That's right.
That's for the best.

1125
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:23,809
Go on, now.

1126
01:16:24,346 --> 01:16:26,280
Yes. Good-bye.

1127
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:31,553
Mr. Kyuki.

1128
01:16:33,922 --> 01:16:34,980
What's wrong?

1129
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,320
I'm fine.
Get on the train.

1130
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:38,984
Are you really okay?

1131
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:41,093
The train is leaving.

1132
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:47,263
<i>Departing from Platform 14,</i>
<i>the</i> Seto <i>for Uno Taisha.</i>

1133
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,667
<i>If you're seeing passengers off,</i>
<i>please step behind the white line.</i>

1134
01:16:52,608 --> 01:16:53,973
Mr. Kyuki.

1135
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:57,335
I'm taking the next train.
I'll take you home.

1136
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:01,109
Kuri, could you do me a favor
before you leave Tokyo?

1137
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:04,684
Tell me you've decided
on the Toyo Flowers.

1138
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:11,923
I just want to hear those words
from your own mouth.

1139
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,522
Okay? Would you promise?

1140
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:23,501
Thank you.

1141
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,765
I'll be a few days late.

1142
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:30,237
Hold out until the last moment.

1143
01:17:30,879 --> 01:17:32,073
Okay?

1144
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:36,416
The longer you hold out,
even a day or two,

1145
01:17:36,518 --> 01:17:38,486
the more valuable you will be.

1146
01:17:39,221 --> 01:17:40,518
I know.

1147
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:44,149
The train is leaving.
Go on.

1148
01:18:28,437 --> 01:18:30,462
A 10-MILLION-YEN PLAYER
IS BORN?

1149
01:18:30,572 --> 01:18:34,235
SIGNING AT FAMILY HOME
IN SHIKOKU?

1150
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,776
SCOUTS RUSH TO SHIKOKU

1151
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:39,312
WADS OF CASH START FLYING

1152
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:10,537
<i>A fox. A weasel.</i>

1153
01:19:11,346 --> 01:19:14,611
<i>A snake. A worm.</i>

1154
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:19,819
<i>Look at them.</i>
<i>No brawn, all cunning.</i>

1155
01:19:20,956 --> 01:19:24,289
<i>Boss, it's the showdown.</i>

1156
01:19:25,160 --> 01:19:27,151
<i>Real bullets, real blood.</i>

1157
01:19:28,363 --> 01:19:30,388
<i>But when the night is over,</i>

1158
01:19:30,999 --> 01:19:34,093
<i>a barely 20-year-old student</i>
<i>will become a millionaire.</i>

1159
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:36,434
<i>What's going on here?</i>

1160
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:02,429
His salary will equal
a government minister's, they say.

1161
01:20:02,531 --> 01:20:04,192
Can't thank baseball enough.

1162
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:11,529
Come on, <i>Sports Mirror.</i>

1163
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,039
Wait a second.

1164
01:20:29,758 --> 01:20:34,695
We're causing you all so much trouble
because we love Goro.

1165
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:39,231
We want to select the team
that's best for him.

1166
01:20:41,970 --> 01:20:47,169
We'd like to add half a million
to our proposed signing bonus.

1167
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:51,737
So how about 8.5 million?

1168
01:20:53,281 --> 01:20:56,444
Your Handen team is, for now,
the most promising.

1169
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,116
You're honest.
We like that.

1170
01:21:01,756 --> 01:21:04,987
We'll pay right now
if he signs with us.

1171
01:21:05,093 --> 01:21:06,754
We have the cash here.

1172
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:18,466
Come take a look.

1173
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:23,275
What's that?

1174
01:21:23,378 --> 01:21:24,709
Furukawa,
with the Osaka Socks.

1175
01:21:27,215 --> 01:21:30,241
I see. A <i>gift</i> of a cow.
Great idea.

1176
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:31,910
Perfect for the peasants.

1177
01:21:33,321 --> 01:21:34,982
Come on, you cow.

1178
01:21:35,523 --> 01:21:38,492
Come here, or you'll end up
in beef stew.

1179
01:21:38,593 --> 01:21:40,322
Come on. Come.

1180
01:21:43,865 --> 01:21:46,333
Father, where are you going?

1181
01:21:47,769 --> 01:21:50,067
You gotta listen to this.

1182
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:02,275
If Handen says 8.5 million,
we can pay up to nine million.

1183
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,808
160,000 yen a month.

1184
01:22:06,354 --> 01:22:07,878
Isn't that enough?

1185
01:22:07,989 --> 01:22:09,422
What about the tax?

1186
01:22:09,524 --> 01:22:11,116
The tax is separate.

1187
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:16,063
Tamekichi, let's talk over the details
when Shiro is back.

1188
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:17,290
What?

1189
01:22:18,967 --> 01:22:20,434
Is Shiro on the boat?

1190
01:22:20,969 --> 01:22:23,267
Yes. He'll be back in the evening.

1191
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:30,504
My director and manager will be here
tomorrow morning. Will you meet them?

1192
01:22:31,112 --> 01:22:32,545
We'll meet anyone.

1193
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:38,382
We all have to see
what the manager is like.

1194
01:22:41,656 --> 01:22:43,055
I'll see you then.

1195
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:45,422
GOMEN STATION

1196

KOCHI NEWS
KURITA RUNS TO HANDEN?

1197
01:23:07,649 --> 01:23:09,879
TEAMS BATTLE
10-MILLION PLAYER GOES WHERE?

1198
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:12,215
BRIBES PAID TO IPPEl KYUKI,
THE FIXER BEHIND KURITA

1199
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,446
Mr. Kishimoto.

1200
01:23:19,361 --> 01:23:21,795
- Hello.
- He came down with a fever in Itami.

1201
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:23,921
Not a trip for a sick man.

1202
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:27,933
Thank you.

1203
01:23:28,036 --> 01:23:29,264
How are you?

1204
01:23:29,804 --> 01:23:31,704
It's not that bad.

1205
01:23:31,806 --> 01:23:34,775
I've been waiting for you.
I got a hotel for you.

1206
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:36,671
How's it going?

1207
01:23:36,778 --> 01:23:39,076
I'm glad you made it early.

1208
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:41,045
Handen. Osaka. Kyushu.

1209
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:45,643
And then Chubu, Shinkyu and the Ticks
all broke their silence and rushed over.

1210
01:23:45,754 --> 01:23:47,278
Anybody talked about me?

1211
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:51,758
You know it's a small house.
It's chaos with both friends and foes.

1212
01:23:54,195 --> 01:23:55,685
And Kuri?

1213
01:23:55,797 --> 01:23:57,628
He hasn't shown up.

1214
01:23:58,199 --> 01:24:00,759
It seems his brothers
hid him somewhere.

1215
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:02,769
On top of everything,
look at this.

1216
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,066
The <i>Kochi News</i>
has written about you.

1217
01:24:13,748 --> 01:24:16,308
That's Kurita hitting a home run.

1218
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:20,514
Mr. Kurita, Mrs. Kurita,
that's your son running.

1219
01:24:26,261 --> 01:24:30,288
You fought Dad, Tamekichi,
and cut ties with the family.

1220
01:24:30,832 --> 01:24:32,629
How can you act
like Goro's brother now?

1221
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:36,192
What did you say, Shiro?
Say it again.

1222
01:24:36,304 --> 01:24:37,771
Don't, Tame.

1223
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:43,402
Shiro, Tame and the others are only
trying to do what's best for Goro.

1224
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:47,242
Since when are you all
such caring brothers?

1225
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:51,214
If you want the best for Goro,
let him do what he wants.

1226
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,220
Don't force him.

1227
01:24:54,089 --> 01:24:59,152
Shiro, I know about you and
Kishimoto with the Toyo Flowers.

1228
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,055
Didn't you take money from him?

1229
01:25:03,064 --> 01:25:04,964
I know you met him at the wharf.

1230
01:25:05,066 --> 01:25:06,397
Maybe I did.

1231
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:10,199
They say you took half a million
from Handen, Tame.

1232
01:25:10,305 --> 01:25:12,933
Shiro, what do you mean to...

1233
01:25:13,041 --> 01:25:14,133
Stop it.

1234
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:17,076
What good is it
to fight in here?

1235
01:25:19,180 --> 01:25:22,513
Saburo, what about you?

1236
01:25:23,184 --> 01:25:25,584
Me? What can I say?

1237
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:29,052
Whatever Goro wants...
Fine by me.

1238
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:34,455
Anyway, we're brothers,
bound by blood ties.

1239
01:25:36,064 --> 01:25:38,828
We gotta protect Goro.

1240
01:25:40,068 --> 01:25:42,536
Otherwise, he'll get ripped off.

1241
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:57,815
What's wrong?

1242
01:25:57,919 --> 01:26:00,945
He's in a lot of pain.
He's just thrown up.

1243
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,019
Please come in.

1244
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,196
Mr. Kyuki, are you all right?

1245
01:26:23,645 --> 01:26:27,342
I haven't eaten anything
since yesterday.

1246
01:26:30,685 --> 01:26:32,312
I saw Shiro.

1247
01:26:33,321 --> 01:26:34,549
How did it go?

1248
01:26:37,225 --> 01:26:39,022
He seemed to favor us.

1249
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:42,491
But he said he didn't know
where Kurita was.

1250
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:47,258
Are you okay, dear?

1251
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:49,326
Shall I get a doctor?

1252
01:26:50,972 --> 01:26:55,033
No. It'll be a problem
if they find out I'm here.

1253
01:26:56,277 --> 01:26:58,768
Ryoko, give me the shot.

1254
01:26:59,547 --> 01:27:00,707
Sure.

1255
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:12,092
Is it okay to do that?

1256
01:27:30,044 --> 01:27:32,877
Natsume, the scout from Kyushu,
had a movie show.

1257
01:27:34,983 --> 01:27:36,951
He didn't know
they'd turn him down.

1258
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:44,158
Shiro said it was between us,
the Osaka Socks, and Handen.

1259
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:48,291
The oldest brother seems to be
in touch with Handen.

1260
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,032
He's fallen asleep.

1261
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:55,694
Then I'm going.

1262
01:27:56,237 --> 01:27:58,569
When I find Kurita's whereabouts,
I'll contact you.

1263
01:27:58,673 --> 01:27:59,867
Please.

1264
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:02,673
Take care.

1265
01:28:04,579 --> 01:28:06,046
Mr. Kishimoto.

1266
01:28:07,115 --> 01:28:09,413
Fueko sends you her regards.

1267
01:28:29,170 --> 01:28:31,536
One million yen,
for Yoneji and you.

1268
01:28:31,639 --> 01:28:32,606
No, no.

1269
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:34,971
If things go wrong,
you'll pay us back.

1270
01:28:45,119 --> 01:28:46,450
Wrap them in this.

1271
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,817
Your signature, please.

1272
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:52,620
You're the eldest son
of the Kurita family.

1273
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:58,394
You're the one
taking care of your parents.

1274
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:01,933
I don't want Tame
to act like a big man.

1275
01:29:02,036 --> 01:29:03,833
You can say that, but...

1276
01:29:03,938 --> 01:29:06,463
You don't need to listen to him.

1277
01:29:07,408 --> 01:29:10,104
Tell them clearly
how much you want.

1278
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:18,085
Well. Hi.
Come here. This way.

1279
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:27,789
Hello. Yeah.
Would you hold on a second?

1280
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:29,692
Mister, you got Tokyo.

1281
01:29:41,776 --> 01:29:45,678
Hello? Kishi...
Kishimoto speaking.

1282
01:29:46,514 --> 01:29:48,812
Where? I'm in Kochi.

1283
01:29:49,350 --> 01:29:51,910
I'm here to meet
the manager tomorrow.

1284
01:29:54,021 --> 01:29:55,579
I'm drunk.

1285
01:29:56,257 --> 01:29:58,885
Yeah, I'm completely drunk.

1286
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:02,292
'Cause I can't trust anyone anymore.

1287
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:08,391
Remember you asked me
what baseball was?

1288
01:30:08,936 --> 01:30:10,369
What is it?

1289
01:30:14,308 --> 01:30:17,766
What?
I don't sound like myself?

1290
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:21,844
Of course I'm not whining.

1291
01:30:23,551 --> 01:30:27,317
I'm not bothered
by conscience or doubt.

1292
01:30:28,389 --> 01:30:31,290
I'm not afraid of hell or demons.

1293
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:35,191
Sorry, sorry. I'm drunk.

1294
01:30:36,998 --> 01:30:38,659
I don't know why, but...

1295
01:30:40,067 --> 01:30:42,433
I just wanted to hear your voice.

1296
01:30:45,773 --> 01:30:47,536
<i>Mr. Kyuki collapsed.</i>

1297
01:30:48,543 --> 01:30:50,511
<i>Whether he's lying or it's for real,</i>

1298
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:54,342
<i>I have no choice</i>
<i>but to believe Mr. Kyuki.</i>

1299
01:30:59,253 --> 01:31:00,743
Why aren't you announcing?

1300
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:03,688
I'm going to a team
with a good manager.

1301
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:06,283
Which one is your favorite?

1302
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:07,986
I'm thinking about it.

1303
01:31:08,095 --> 01:31:09,585
Which did Kyuki recommend?

1304
01:31:09,697 --> 01:31:12,131
He didn't say.
I'm choosing on my own.

1305
01:31:24,979 --> 01:31:26,970
Hello.
Meeting your people here?

1306
01:31:27,648 --> 01:31:28,774
I'm meeting my president.

1307
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:31,477
The president has to settle it.
Ridiculous.

1308
01:31:31,586 --> 01:31:32,951
You can say that again.

1309
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:36,286
A trunk full of cash and bills.
Bowing and begging.

1310
01:31:36,390 --> 01:31:38,290
I won't be able to take it
if rejected.

1311
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:44,129
Didn't you talk with Shiro
in the kitchen last night?

1312
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:46,496
How do you know?

1313
01:31:46,601 --> 01:31:47,863
I was in the bathroom.

1314
01:31:47,969 --> 01:31:48,628
What?

1315
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,533
I couldn't come out with you there.

1316
01:31:51,906 --> 01:31:54,466
I was hungry and had
a bowl of rice and tea.

1317
01:31:54,575 --> 01:31:56,406
Did you like the salt pickles
from Kyoto?

1318
01:31:57,211 --> 01:32:00,237
- Did you eat them, too?
- I gave them those as a <i>gift.</i>

1319
01:32:00,348 --> 01:32:03,476
Sorry about that.
Did you have the <i>castella</i> sponge cake?

1320
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:07,280
Did you give it to them?

1321
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:11,320
The sushi must've been
from the Osaka Socks.

1322
01:32:11,425 --> 01:32:13,655
Local specialties are coming in
from all over the country.

1323
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:18,756
Hello, thanks for coming.
We're here like everybody else.

1324
01:32:18,866 --> 01:32:21,096
That's Kawajiri,
the Osaka Socks manager.

1325
01:32:23,638 --> 01:32:25,367
- Thank you for flying with us.
- Hello.

1326
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,207
So?

1327
01:32:28,109 --> 01:32:31,169
If I fail, I'll kill Kurita and Kyuki
and commit suicide.

1328
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:32,769
A scout's suicide in Kochi.

1329
01:32:34,282 --> 01:32:37,445
I've never been this eager
to sign a player.

1330
01:32:37,552 --> 01:32:40,715
As the manager, I guarantee
he'll be our cleanup hitter.

1331
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:44,884
If we choose you,
be sure to follow through on that.

1332
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:49,595
The Kyushu Tulips people are here.

1333
01:32:55,836 --> 01:32:58,100
We're saying no to them.

1334
01:33:00,074 --> 01:33:03,976
I may be turned away
at the door tomorrow.

1335
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:05,875
No, you won't be.

1336
01:33:10,051 --> 01:33:11,484
Excuse me.

1337
01:33:25,866 --> 01:33:27,231
Excuse me.

1338
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:30,967
Who is it?

1339
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:35,666
Kuri's here, isn't he?

1340
01:33:42,283 --> 01:33:44,615
Kurita. Goro Kurita.

1341
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:47,244
You can't hide him. I know.

1342
01:33:47,355 --> 01:33:48,913
Who are you?

1343
01:33:49,557 --> 01:33:51,718
- Give this to him.
- He's out now.

1344
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:54,351
Make sure to give it to him
when he's back.

1345
01:33:56,731 --> 01:33:58,164
Please, I beg you.

1346
01:34:01,168 --> 01:34:02,135
MR. GORO KURITA

1347
01:34:02,236 --> 01:34:03,430
IPPEl KYUKI

1348
01:34:15,850 --> 01:34:18,580
Goro, let me take a swing.

1349
01:34:18,686 --> 01:34:19,380
Sure.

1350
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,548
Come on, Teru.

1351
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:28,553
Dad, Mom and everybody
agree on the Handen team.

1352
01:34:29,463 --> 01:34:33,490
They'll help them expand the store.
You'll do good by your parents.

1353
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:35,796
Handen's not bad, either.

1354
01:34:36,470 --> 01:34:37,630
Yeah.

1355
01:34:38,606 --> 01:34:41,074
You got something going
with Handen, don't you?

1356
01:34:44,912 --> 01:34:47,813
All your brothers
are looking out for you.

1357
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,011
Be a good boy
and do as we tell you.

1358
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:02,459
Mr. Kyuki.

1359
01:35:03,831 --> 01:35:04,798
Mr. Kishimoto.

1360
01:35:04,899 --> 01:35:06,127
Are you all right?

1361
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,795
I hear they rejected
Kyushu and the Ticks.

1362
01:35:11,172 --> 01:35:13,538
Shiro said they'd reject Handen.

1363
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:15,609
That would leave the Socks and us.

1364
01:35:16,744 --> 01:35:19,975
I had a letter delivered to Kurita.

1365
01:35:20,081 --> 01:35:22,106
He should come see me tonight.

1366
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:26,050
Will he come?

1367
01:35:26,754 --> 01:35:28,381
I wrote that I was in grave condition.

1368
01:35:30,224 --> 01:35:33,990
If he doesn't come,
I'll go see him.

1369
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:38,965
It will be all settled tomorrow.

1370
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,369
This war is almost over.

1371
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,870
A war with money
in place of bombs.

1372
01:35:46,440 --> 01:35:48,840
I really want to see Kurita tonight.

1373
01:35:51,078 --> 01:35:52,204
Mr. Kyuki.

1374
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,983
- Mr. Kyuki.
- It hurts.

1375
01:35:58,919 --> 01:36:00,147
Ouch!

1376
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:13,360
<i>Boss, I believe this man</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

1377
01:36:14,802 --> 01:36:16,497
<i>This is a real illness.</i>

1378
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:18,666
<i>He's not faking it.</i>

1379
01:36:30,217 --> 01:36:32,777
Hello.
Is Kuri's father home?

1380
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:34,749
Who the hell are you?

1381
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,221
I'm Ippei Kyuki's wife.

1382
01:36:37,324 --> 01:36:38,723
Mr. Kyuki?

1383
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:42,022
Don't know him.

1384
01:36:44,165 --> 01:36:46,360
You may not,
but your father does.

1385
01:36:46,467 --> 01:36:47,866
What do you want?

1386
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:52,499
Shiro, it's me.
You met me with Kyuki before.

1387
01:36:57,578 --> 01:37:00,604
Well, I don't know you.

1388
01:37:04,151 --> 01:37:05,550
Go home, girlie.

1389
01:37:06,754 --> 01:37:08,813
We're busy right now.

1390
01:37:10,591 --> 01:37:13,355
All you brothers are in cahoots
to shut out Kyuki.

1391
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:16,156
I told you we don't know Kyuki.

1392
01:37:16,263 --> 01:37:17,821
You're lying through your teeth.

1393
01:37:18,365 --> 01:37:21,732
Who took Kuri the sniveling kid
and raised him so well?

1394
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:23,326
Nobody.

1395
01:37:23,437 --> 01:37:25,234
Who sent him to college?

1396
01:37:25,339 --> 01:37:28,137
Goro was playing baseball
when he was three.

1397
01:37:28,242 --> 01:37:30,540
Haven't you milked him enough?

1398
01:37:30,644 --> 01:37:33,078
We want you to take a hike, already.

1399
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:35,308
You're saying it's your turn.

1400
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:37,247
Kyuki is a leech, isn't he?

1401
01:37:37,952 --> 01:37:40,978
I hear he used Goro
to make tons of money.

1402
01:37:41,088 --> 01:37:44,717
If Kyuki is a leech,
you bastards are mites or lice.

1403
01:37:44,825 --> 01:37:47,385
Kneel down before Kyuki
and thank him.

1404
01:37:48,729 --> 01:37:50,026
Shut up!

1405
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:55,568
How is he?

1406
01:37:56,871 --> 01:37:58,498
He needs complete bed rest.

1407
01:37:59,173 --> 01:38:03,109
If he wants to see anyone,
you'd better call them.

1408
01:38:03,644 --> 01:38:05,271
Is it that bad?

1409
01:38:10,184 --> 01:38:12,448
- Are you Mr. Kishimoto?
- I am.

1410
01:38:12,553 --> 01:38:14,282
There's a telegram for you.

1411
01:38:17,791 --> 01:38:22,160
Arriving at Gomen Station at 10:00.
Come get me. Fueko.

1412
01:38:44,318 --> 01:38:46,115
Hey, Kurita!

1413
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:52,682
Hey, Kurita!

1414
01:39:12,980 --> 01:39:14,948
What a surprise.

1415
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:16,949
When did you get here?

1416
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:18,279
Just now.

1417
01:39:22,523 --> 01:39:24,582
I didn't come here for you.

1418
01:39:30,164 --> 01:39:32,962
I have a lot to tell you, Fueko.

1419
01:39:34,335 --> 01:39:36,769
I have nothing to say to you.

1420
01:39:36,870 --> 01:39:38,269
It's just...

1421
01:39:39,773 --> 01:39:44,210
I'm not asking you to, but I wish
you'd join Mr. Kishimoto's team.

1422
01:39:46,513 --> 01:39:48,947
I'll join whatever team I please
without being asked.

1423
01:39:53,354 --> 01:39:54,787
It's my life.

1424
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:25,013
Kurita, do you understand?

1425
01:40:26,053 --> 01:40:27,850
Would you say yes?

1426
01:40:28,789 --> 01:40:31,781
Would you tell me,
"I've decided on the Toyo Flowers"?

1427
01:40:33,827 --> 01:40:35,920
Maybe I'm going to die like this.

1428
01:40:36,530 --> 01:40:39,055
In a way, I know I will.

1429
01:40:40,334 --> 01:40:44,668
I'll never forget how much I owe you
for the rest of my life, Mr. Kyuki.

1430
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:48,038
But I can't give you
the answer you want.

1431
01:40:50,144 --> 01:40:54,046
You used to understand me
better than anyone, didn't you?

1432
01:40:54,148 --> 01:40:57,276
Right? Or was it all lies?

1433
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:01,513
I've thought it over carefully.

1434
01:41:02,322 --> 01:41:05,758
And I've decided on the Osaka Socks.

1435
01:41:07,261 --> 01:41:08,592
The Osaka Socks?

1436
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:14,025
No. You can't do that.

1437
01:41:14,134 --> 01:41:15,465
Are you betraying me?

1438
01:41:15,569 --> 01:41:18,970
Being indebted to you is one thing.
Wanting to join the Socks is another.

1439
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:20,335
Kurita...

1440
01:41:20,941 --> 01:41:23,136
- Forgive me.
- Kurita.

1441
01:41:24,611 --> 01:41:25,771
Kurita.

1442
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:30,745
It's okay for you to turn us down.
I'm fine.

1443
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:32,752
Of course I'm disappointed.

1444
01:41:33,687 --> 01:41:39,091
But how can you betray someone
who has believed in you so deeply?

1445
01:41:39,827 --> 01:41:41,488
Don't you have a heart?

1446
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:46,563
Why couldn't you share your feelings
with the one who believed in you?

1447
01:41:48,001 --> 01:41:51,129
How many have suffered now
because of your dishonesty?

1448
01:41:51,238 --> 01:41:54,071
Why couldn't you tell Mr. Kyuki
you'd go to the Socks?

1449
01:41:54,174 --> 01:41:56,165
I wanted to say it many times.

1450
01:41:56,777 --> 01:41:59,337
But each time, Mr. Kyuki said,
"Leave it to me."

1451
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:03,382
What're you saying?
You're not a man. You're a monster.

1452
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:05,213
A hypocrite who fooled all the teams.

1453
01:42:05,319 --> 01:42:08,516
Whatever you say,
I'm taking my own path.

1454
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:18,094
Please, Kurita,
think it over one more time.

1455
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:20,997
What's wrong
with the Toyo Flowers?

1456
01:42:21,101 --> 01:42:23,126
They're offering
the largest signing bonus.

1457
01:42:23,237 --> 01:42:27,173
I respect Mr. Kawajiri,
the Osaka Socks manager.

1458
01:42:28,108 --> 01:42:31,407
I'll negotiate with Mr. Kawajiri
to get you a large finder's fee.

1459
01:42:31,512 --> 01:42:32,740
You'll...

1460
01:42:36,583 --> 01:42:39,746
This is from your father and mother.

1461
01:42:39,853 --> 01:42:44,654
They wrote this pledge
to entrust your future to me.

1462
01:42:45,592 --> 01:42:47,059
I didn't sign it.

1463
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:48,526
What're you saying?

1464
01:42:50,697 --> 01:42:53,598
In your heart,
you surely signed it.

1465
01:42:55,302 --> 01:42:59,261
Mr. Kyuki, I'm indebted to you,
and I'll repay the obligation.

1466
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:02,971
I'm pursuing my own path.

1467
01:43:03,777 --> 01:43:05,074
Kurita.

1468
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:07,473
Dear.

1469
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:12,784
I'm sorry.

1470
01:43:13,453 --> 01:43:15,785
I'll come back at another time
to thank you.

1471
01:43:16,623 --> 01:43:18,147
Do as you please.

1472
01:43:19,426 --> 01:43:20,825
Take care.

1473
01:43:32,539 --> 01:43:33,471
Kurita.

1474
01:43:44,251 --> 01:43:47,709
You were using them, <i>after</i> all.
You coward.

1475
01:43:57,864 --> 01:43:58,990
Hello.

1476
01:44:02,002 --> 01:44:04,664
Dear. Dear.

1477
01:44:07,841 --> 01:44:08,967
Fueko.

1478
01:44:11,211 --> 01:44:12,337
Kurita.

1479
01:44:13,380 --> 01:44:14,642
Kurita!

1480
01:44:31,531 --> 01:44:34,523
Three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, ten.

1481
01:44:35,969 --> 01:44:37,334
Here you go.

1482
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:39,064
And here...

1483
01:44:39,773 --> 01:44:41,707
Your signature and your seal, please.

1484
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:43,774
The family seal, Shiro.

1485
01:44:45,712 --> 01:44:46,838
Here you go.

1486
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:01,728
GORO KURITA

1487
01:45:05,799 --> 01:45:07,289
You don't have it all?

1488
01:45:19,913 --> 01:45:20,902
Shiro.

1489
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:25,109
How much did they give you?

1490
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,951
I'm not a petty bastard like you.

1491
01:45:29,056 --> 01:45:31,616
Tell me how much they gave you!

1492
01:45:33,393 --> 01:45:34,792
Enough is enough.

1493
01:45:36,897 --> 01:45:38,194
You want a piece of me?

1494
01:45:38,298 --> 01:45:42,029
Tamekichi. Brother.
Don't. Stop it.

1495
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:43,795
Shiro.

1496
01:45:46,106 --> 01:45:47,266
Tame.

1497
01:45:48,041 --> 01:45:51,204
Tamekichi. Tame.

1498
01:45:58,218 --> 01:45:59,412
Ryoko.

1499
01:45:59,519 --> 01:46:00,986
I'm here.

1500
01:46:02,522 --> 01:46:04,820
I'm not gonna make it.

1501
01:46:05,792 --> 01:46:07,054
What're you saying?

1502
01:46:08,128 --> 01:46:09,857
You mustn't lose spirit.

1503
01:46:11,231 --> 01:46:16,999
My life...
It's my life, so I know.

1504
01:46:21,575 --> 01:46:25,807
I hate to betray you, but...

1505
01:46:29,349 --> 01:46:34,981
My wife and kids in Okayama.

1506
01:46:35,555 --> 01:46:37,420
Would you let me see them?

1507
01:46:41,161 --> 01:46:43,186
I'm sorry.

1508
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:46,962
Please.

1509
01:46:53,006 --> 01:46:54,337
Now, with the manager.

1510
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:55,840
Shake hands.

1511
01:46:55,942 --> 01:46:57,068
Smile.

1512
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:11,755
May I?

1513
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:19,523
Kurita, Mr. Kyuki's condition is critical.

1514
01:47:20,934 --> 01:47:23,562
I think you can thank him one last time.

1515
01:47:23,670 --> 01:47:26,833
I can't go now. I have interviews
and round-table meetings.

1516
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:29,602
I came to tell you
as a friend of Mr. Kyuki's.

1517
01:47:29,709 --> 01:47:31,904
He's not faking it.
It's really bad.

1518
01:47:32,646 --> 01:47:34,136
Excuse me, this way.

1519
01:47:35,882 --> 01:47:38,180
Could you hold the bat?
Could you swing it?

1520
01:47:39,719 --> 01:47:41,118
Thank you.

1521
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:49,160
Kurita, Mr. Kyuki may die.

1522
01:47:49,262 --> 01:47:51,856
What's wrong with Mr. Kyuki?
Is he here?

1523
01:47:55,602 --> 01:47:57,331
What's wrong with Mr. Kyuki?

1524
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:06,541
Mr. Kishimoto.
He's so cruel.

1525
01:48:06,646 --> 01:48:09,615
He should rot in hell.
Why didn't he just say, "Socks"?

1526
01:48:09,716 --> 01:48:12,981
Don't. We lost in our game.
We'll get revenge in our own way.

1527
01:48:13,086 --> 01:48:15,748
We'll find a pitcher
to strike out Kurita to death.

1528
01:48:33,707 --> 01:48:35,072
- Vita-camphor.
- Right away.

1529
01:48:47,721 --> 01:48:48,881
Hurry.

1530
01:48:53,793 --> 01:48:55,283
Kurita...

1531
01:48:56,162 --> 01:48:57,686
Mr. Kishimoto...

1532
01:48:59,566 --> 01:49:01,500
Trust me.

1533
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:11,409
Please.

1534
01:49:13,013 --> 01:49:16,972
Believe me.

1535
01:49:26,893 --> 01:49:28,087
Flashlight.

1536
01:49:37,137 --> 01:49:38,604
He's gone.

1537
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:42,169
10:31.

1538
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:18,075
Mr. Kyuki is...

1539
01:50:22,849 --> 01:50:25,875
"Mr. Kishimoto, believe me."

1540
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:29,085
Those were his last words.

1541
01:50:38,898 --> 01:50:42,595
Kurita's brother stabbed his own brother
and was arrested by the police.

1542
01:50:43,937 --> 01:50:46,929
His mother was crying,
saying Goro was not her son.

1543
01:51:19,572 --> 01:51:22,097
<i>The fourth batter,</i>
<i>left fielder, Kurita.</i>

1544
01:51:23,209 --> 01:51:26,235
<i>The fourth batter,</i>
<i>left fielder, Kurita.</i>

1545
01:51:26,346 --> 01:51:28,541
<i>Uniform number 25.</i>

1546
01:51:55,575 --> 01:52:00,274
THE END
