1
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:46,526
Ladies and gentlemen - Mike Ribble, the
only man alive today to attempt a triple.

2
00:00:46,651 --> 00:00:50,820
Three complete somersaults before
reaching the arms of his catcher.

3
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:42,112
<i>Halt! Halt!</i>

4
00:03:52,825 --> 00:03:57,328
You see, Achille, here I am 46 years old,
and suddenly I start to grow.

5
00:03:57,495 --> 00:04:01,496
Before, the lowest bar on the lion's cage
was two inches above my head.

6
00:04:01,662 --> 00:04:04,914
- Now it is only one.
- Maybe they shifted the bar.

7
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,540
- You know a fella named Mike Ribble?
- No.

8
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,095
<i>- Ce n'est pas si mal que ça, monsieur.
- Ou sont les gueules?</i>

9
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:34,261
<i>- Vous voulez des tigres?
- Et mon nom?</i>

10
00:04:34,428 --> 00:04:36,262
"Monsieur Bouglione".

11
00:04:36,429 --> 00:04:40,556
<i>Chaque année, il est de plus en plus
minuscule. Refaites-moi cette affiche.</i>

12
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:47,268
Monsieur Bouglione, you like? Beautiful,
yes? By opening night, magnificent. I...

13
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:51,521
- What they do, I see. What do you do?
- Me? I show you.

14
00:04:54,522 --> 00:04:56,606
Hey-hup!

15
00:04:57,607 --> 00:04:59,690
Hey-hup!

16
00:04:59,857 --> 00:05:00,983
Hup!

17
00:05:01,109 --> 00:05:03,151
Alley-oop!

18
00:05:10,113 --> 00:05:12,447
<i>- Parlez Anglais?
- Yeah.</i>

19
00:05:12,614 --> 00:05:15,323
- Do you know Mike Ribble?
- Never heard of him.

20
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:19,534
Want a snake act? Three of the sweetest
performers that ever circled a torso.

21
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:23,328
- He's got the build for it, hasn't he?
- He don't look like a snake lover.

22
00:05:23,452 --> 00:05:26,371
- Anybody know Mike Ribble?
- Say hello to the gentleman.

23
00:05:26,537 --> 00:05:29,123
American. A great flier.
You know, the trapeze.

24
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:31,748
- He's got a job here.
- I knew a man named Gribble.

25
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:36,750
Did an act with a python of uncertain
temper and extraordinary big jaws.

26
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:39,168
- Who are you?
- Tino Orsini.

27
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:41,795
- Guido Orsini your father?
- Yeah.

28
00:05:41,962 --> 00:05:45,171
- Cheap due to unforeseen circumstances.
- That's Ribble.

29
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:47,673
Above the plane, tightening the rigging.

30
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:53,008
Baby, wake up. She's a bit sluggish
since her dinner last week.

31
00:05:53,134 --> 00:05:55,801
Mr Ribble! Say, Mr Ribble!

32
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:59,886
You! In my circus, when I
put together a show I have silence.

33
00:06:00,053 --> 00:06:03,097
- I just wanna see Mr Ribble.
- See him on his time, not mine.

34
00:06:03,222 --> 00:06:06,223
- Monsieur, you said you'd find a buyer.
- I find no buyer.

35
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:09,475
Everybody knows
the snake killed your brother.

36
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:14,269
She's high-spirited, that's all. If she's
warm it's safe. My brother let her get cold.

37
00:06:14,394 --> 00:06:18,062
If you did not already have a snake act,
would you buy a snake act?

38
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:22,732
Now watch. Off the bars,
a double forward twist.

39
00:06:26,316 --> 00:06:29,984
- We do business, monsieur?
- I see these boys work before.

40
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:32,819
- Where'd they find you?
- They're lucky, no?

41
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:36,362
- Where you find her?
- We don't find her. She finds us.

42
00:06:36,487 --> 00:06:37,488
Well?

43
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,032
I pay you what you got before,
and I check what you got before.

44
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:44,451
But the Cirque d'Hiver
is more important than where we were.

45
00:06:44,576 --> 00:06:47,118
The Cirque d'Hiver, yes. Your act, no.

46
00:06:47,243 --> 00:06:50,286
- Look, I take the act as it is.
- All right.

47
00:06:50,411 --> 00:06:52,454
Same pay.

48
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,623
Ah...

49
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:01,374
- He likes us?
- What did he say?

50
00:07:01,499 --> 00:07:03,710
Come on, say it.

51
00:07:03,835 --> 00:07:06,586
- What's the matter, Lola?
- Whatever he said, say it.

52
00:07:06,753 --> 00:07:08,795
Come on. Speak, Lola.

53
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,296
- Bouglione...
- Yeah?

54
00:07:10,421 --> 00:07:13,340
- He will not buy the act as it is.
- Why?

55
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:17,924
- He wants me to do more.
- More for you? Already there is too much!

56
00:07:18,091 --> 00:07:22,761
I do not say it's my idea that I do more.
It's Bouglione. He insist.

57
00:07:22,927 --> 00:07:25,262
Otherwise, we don't work.

58
00:07:25,428 --> 00:07:28,305
You're always trying
to do more. It's our act.

59
00:07:30,764 --> 00:07:34,975
Ali, if you feel this way about me,
I will leave the act.

60
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:42,394
<i>Oh, shut up.</i>

61
00:07:50,024 --> 00:07:53,317
Mr Ribble? Hey, Mr Ribble?

62
00:07:54,693 --> 00:07:58,235
Hey, get down out of there
before you fall down.

63
00:07:58,361 --> 00:08:01,403
- But I'm a flier.
- I don't care what you are. Get down.

64
00:08:01,528 --> 00:08:07,199
I came all the way from Brooklyn
to see you. My old man is Guido Orsini.

65
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,700
That buzzard still flyin'?

66
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:14,452
He taught me all he knew. You're
the only man who can teach me more.

67
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:19,163
Tell him I'm not a coach. I'm a rigger.
And tell him in person, back in Brooklyn.

68
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:23,414
- Look, Mr Ribble...
- Go on, beat it, son. I'm busy.

69
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:27,750
I want something only you can give me.

70
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,629
You're the only man in the world
that can teach me the triple.

71
00:08:39,547 --> 00:08:43,424
The triple? Are you crazy?
Don't you know why I'm a rigger?

72
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:46,842
I throw a double somersault.
I need a little help on the third.

73
00:08:46,968 --> 00:08:50,762
- Just a little help on the third, huh?
- I know it's not easy...

74
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:55,514
You come out of that third somersault like
an express train. And you come out blind.

75
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:01,225
A split second to reach for your catcher,
and a split second for him to grab you.

76
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:03,601
- That's all there is to it.
- All I want...

77
00:09:03,726 --> 00:09:07,228
How many wet-eared kids have
come to me tryin' to suck me back in?

78
00:09:07,395 --> 00:09:09,729
But you top 'em all. You wanna do a triple.

79
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:13,897
All I ask is one look. If you don't think
I got it, I'll go back to Brooklyn.

80
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:16,898
Well, start packin'.

81
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:46,997
How am I doing?

82
00:09:48,581 --> 00:09:50,332
How about this?

83
00:09:50,499 --> 00:09:54,001
You tryin' to leave your fingerprints
on the bar? Grip it lightly.

84
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:58,586
Get your hands closer together.
They're too far apart.

85
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,921
Closer still. Shoulder width.

86
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:07,673
When you do a roll over the bar that way,
shoot way up in the air.

87
00:10:09,258 --> 00:10:11,759
You know, I modelled
my style after yours.

88
00:10:11,926 --> 00:10:16,220
Then you'll always be a second-rater.
Make your own style.

89
00:10:16,345 --> 00:10:18,846
You don't force out high enough.

90
00:10:19,013 --> 00:10:25,391
You'll never reach your catcher unless
you kick for the ceiling. Watch my swing.

91
00:10:28,017 --> 00:10:32,436
There. This is where your catcher
would be for any big trick.

92
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,604
Here I come. Catch me!

93
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:40,607
- You fool! Without a net?
- Who needs a net?

94
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:44,358
- I should have dropped you on your head.
- But you didn't.

95
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,402
You! I told you before, get down.

96
00:10:47,527 --> 00:10:50,320
A dead flier becomes a live catcher.

97
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:04,409
You've got great hands.
Be a catcher. Catch me.

98
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,078
I'm no catcher,
not for you or anybody else.

99
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,913
Come back in the business.
We'll make a team.

100
00:11:10,038 --> 00:11:13,039
The only act to do a triple -
Ribble and Orsini.

101
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:19,584
You want my advice? Well, here it is. Fly
back to Brooklyn while you can still fly.

102
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:49,973
From flier to rigger in one accident.
New York to Paris. He's fallen a long way.

103
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:53,725
- He's not smashed up as bad as I heard.
- It's his heart that's smashed.

104
00:11:53,892 --> 00:11:57,061
He used to be a flier.
Now he can't even get on the pedestal.

105
00:11:57,228 --> 00:12:00,938
What good is life to a bird if he can't fly?
You can understand.

106
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:04,230
Sure I can. Mr Bouglione?
How'd you like my act?

107
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:06,148
- What act?
- Ribble and Orsini.

108
00:12:06,315 --> 00:12:10,691
You come here, do two flips on the bar,
make one pass, right away you got an act.

109
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:15,277
Congratulations. One of you runs
before he can walk, the other a cripple.

110
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:19,821
Ribble wants to work with me. Are you
interested or do I go somewhere else?

111
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:25,324
I'm interested, but I know this man better
than you do. Remember, I warned you.

112
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:39,413
- You still here? Up all night, huh?
- Look, Mr Ribble...

113
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:43,750
That's why there are
no more performers. Nobody trains.

114
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,547
That's the lousiest full twist...

115
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,757
Look what you did.

116
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:03,677
Mr Ribble?

117
00:13:03,844 --> 00:13:06,052
How about this?

118
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:14,305
It's not like workin' with my own bars,
but tell me what you think anyway.

119
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,767
Hands close enough together, Mr Ribble?

120
00:13:24,352 --> 00:13:27,104
What do you think, Mr Ribble?

121
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:39,526
- How's that, Mr Ribble?
- Lousy.

122
00:14:13,877 --> 00:14:15,669
Mike?

123
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:20,045
- Who is it?
- Mike, it is Rosa.

124
00:14:20,212 --> 00:14:21,547
Rosa!

125
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:24,716
Where'd you come from?
I thought you were in Australia.

126
00:14:24,882 --> 00:14:27,925
And Africa. Three years. I am back, Mike.

127
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:31,093
We are opening here.
What are you doing now?

128
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:34,179
<i>- Come here, let's have a look at you.
- Rosa!</i>

129
00:14:34,304 --> 00:14:38,431
- You want my horses to catch a cold?
- Well, if it ain't old Chikki.

130
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:41,640
The horses first,
always the horses, eh, Chikki?

131
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:47,518
I thought you were dead. She's Mrs Chikki
Fauchon now. I married her last year.

132
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:50,770
Well, congratulations. You're a lucky man.

133
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:53,104
<i>You should know.</i>

134
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:56,314
Rosa, come on. Come on, Rosa!

135
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:30,705
Lady? Oh, lady, excuse me.

136
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:34,458
Would you do me a favour? Can I talk
to you? You seem to know Mr Ribble...

137
00:15:37,584 --> 00:15:40,835
Hey, rigger, come here.
We want to talk to you.

138
00:15:41,002 --> 00:15:44,546
- Have a drink?
- What? Yeah, sure. Bottle of beer.

139
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:48,339
We make some changes in the act.
The rigging will have to be different.

140
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:52,925
We need a third bar and another set
of wires eight feet from the centre bar.

141
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:55,802
I want the apron
extended another four feet.

142
00:15:55,926 --> 00:15:59,512
And the platform
should be dropped six inches.

143
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:04,389
Of course, the tension will have to be
checked for my takeoff.

144
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:10,683
I'd like it to be ready first thing
in the morning, so if you'll get to it...

145
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,893
- Did you hear what I said?
- Sure.

146
00:16:13,018 --> 00:16:17,436
You said the spotlight will be on you
when you do a flyaway at the finish.

147
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:21,271
Oh, shut up. Shut up!

148
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:26,774
- Is there something better to put it on?
- That depends. What are you selling?

149
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:39,197
- Hey, there's a picture of you.
- Don't just stand there. Order something.

150
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:41,199
- Beer.
- Make it two.

151
00:16:41,365 --> 00:16:49,285
Clark, Segrist, Concello,
Codona, Amadori and... and Ribble.

152
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:53,121
The only six men in the world
that ever threw a triple.

153
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:57,123
There'll never be a seventh. When
circus was real, flying was a religion.

154
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:03,459
Now what have you got? Pink lights,
ballet girls, blue sawdust. A lot of hoopla.

155
00:17:05,877 --> 00:17:11,796
You'll never throw a triple. You know
why? Because you drink too much.

156
00:17:11,963 --> 00:17:15,882
...so after I got 'em, I thought about
the snakeskin-shoe business.

157
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:20,342
But how many pairs of shoes
can you get from a trio of pythons?

158
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:04,488
- Are you happy with Chikki?
- I'm not unhappy. Eat the soup.

159
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:09,742
- Stop mothering me.
- Why? Isn't that what all loves come to?

160
00:18:09,908 --> 00:18:13,909
Mike, why don't you shave
at least every other day?

161
00:18:14,076 --> 00:18:19,787
Shave, eat... I'm getting
a regular life since you came back.

162
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:22,414
That boy. Is he trapeze?

163
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:24,957
He wants to be a flier.

164
00:18:25,082 --> 00:18:27,334
Has he talent?

165
00:18:32,585 --> 00:18:35,421
Could be great. Just great.

166
00:18:40,923 --> 00:18:46,259
You know, Mike, I often wondered
why you never became a catcher.

167
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:56,181
When did you start wondering?
About three minutes ago?

168
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:19,525
You got to learn to tumble,
my boy. Like me.

169
00:19:21,777 --> 00:19:27,529
Mike, you like that boy. Team up with him.
Catch him. Nobody can do it better.

170
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:32,074
Before he becomes this great catcher
he might change the rigging for my act.

171
00:19:32,199 --> 00:19:38,493
- Don't let your partners hear it's your act.
- You said he could be great.

172
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:42,745
He could be the seventh man
in the world to do a triple.

173
00:19:43,954 --> 00:19:46,789
Oh, Mike, Mike...

174
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:49,706
You spent years on the triple.
Look what it did to you!

175
00:19:49,831 --> 00:19:54,000
Now you can have a good flying act
without it. Don't let the triple kill it.

176
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:56,835
- It's in him. Why shouldn't he do it?
- For what?

177
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:59,044
To pull a shoulder? Break his back?

178
00:19:59,211 --> 00:20:02,880
I'll show him what I did wrong.
We'll be the greatest in the business.

179
00:20:03,005 --> 00:20:06,423
- For how long?
- You want him to swing on a single bar?

180
00:20:06,548 --> 00:20:12,426
Not with that kind of talent. I'd rather
see him cutting hair in a barber's shop.

181
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,482
Now, tomorrow we'll...

182
00:20:57,156 --> 00:21:02,784
Now, tomorrow you'll get down to
business. You'll do no more drinkin'.

183
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:13,831
Watch. The man that photographed
my fall was your best friend.

184
00:21:13,998 --> 00:21:17,791
He can keep you
from making the same mistake.

185
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:21,793
I'm breaking from the bar too late.
First somersault OK. Second OK.

186
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,794
Third somersault - short.

187
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,755
That's the boner that cost me the triple.
Not big, but fatal.

188
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:33,215
So we'll start at the beginning and make
each move perfect before we try the next.

189
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,883
I'll run it again for you.

190
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:40,802
Take a natural set now. That's it.
Hold it, hold it. Break! Break full!

191
00:21:40,927 --> 00:21:45,220
Keep your head up. Don't bend those legs.
What are they made of, rubber?

192
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:49,973
That's it. Down the hill.
Right, back up. Now hold it. Now break!

193
00:21:53,475 --> 00:21:55,976
Go.

194
00:21:56,101 --> 00:21:59,437
Hold it. Hold it.
Now take a natural set. Natural.

195
00:21:59,604 --> 00:22:01,854
Good. Great!

196
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,522
No!

197
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:08,065
No, no, no! Too late. Too late.

198
00:22:08,191 --> 00:22:14,402
You'll bust your neck. It always happens
when you break too late. Let's try it again.

199
00:22:18,613 --> 00:22:20,654
Hit it.

200
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:29,367
You got to learn to miss a trick
as well as catch it.

201
00:22:29,534 --> 00:22:34,537
Landing in the net that way, you'll break
your neck just as easy as hitting the floor.

202
00:22:34,704 --> 00:22:37,205
Now you watch that.

203
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:41,831
Bring those knees up more.
Hug your chest.

204
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:47,752
When you do a triple you gotta be
a tight little ball. Let's do it again.

205
00:22:48,877 --> 00:22:50,128
That's better.

206
00:22:53,713 --> 00:22:59,049
You're late again. If you can't make
those easy ones, we'll never get to a triple.

207
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,050
Mike?

208
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,011
Hit it!

209
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:20,309
Next time you try a double,
get that time right.

210
00:23:20,476 --> 00:23:25,062
The clock inside you always knows what
time it is. Keep it tickin' alongside mine.

211
00:23:25,229 --> 00:23:29,230
We'll never get a triple until we
keep the same time. Let's try it again.

212
00:23:29,396 --> 00:23:33,482
Have the confidence that I'll be there
to take you. Here's what you're doin'.

213
00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,943
You got your legs here. Here's your body.
That's the position you come in to me in.

214
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:42,444
When I take you by the legs, fine, but you
get that whip in the end and I lose you.

215
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:47,197
Now, if you come in to me like this, we get
that beautiful smooth rideaway. Got it?

216
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:51,198
The double cutaway to the stick,
that's a different story entirely.

217
00:23:55,992 --> 00:24:00,120
Good, good, good!
You're beginning to look like a flier.

218
00:24:05,331 --> 00:24:08,415
- How about the triple?
- I'll tell you when you're ready.

219
00:24:08,582 --> 00:24:11,458
- Monsieur Bouglione!
- You're in, Mike. I buy this act!

220
00:24:11,583 --> 00:24:13,292
- Monsieur?
- Yes?

221
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:17,294
Everybody wants me to do more
in the act, so I must have a new costume.

222
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:18,963
- Do you like it?
- Uh-huh.

223
00:24:19,088 --> 00:24:23,005
I'm glad you like it. My partners
will need a little advance to pay for it.

224
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,841
I have to sell tickets, not buy costumes.

225
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:29,425
Costumes sell tickets, don't they?
Costumes like this?

226
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:33,344
That we'll never know.
The bill is already full. Your act is out.

227
00:24:33,511 --> 00:24:38,264
- We're out? But we had an agreement.
- Perhaps you'd like to show it to me?

228
00:24:38,430 --> 00:24:42,056
<i>Ingrato mascalzone!
Non te la caverai, sai?</i>

229
00:24:42,181 --> 00:24:45,183
<i>lo ti faccio causa, capito? Disgraziato!</i>

230
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,185
<i>Non sei degno di avere un'artista
come me. Vigliacco, brutto mascalzone!</i>

231
00:24:49,352 --> 00:24:52,478
Don't shout. Ask yourself
which is the better act.

232
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:56,022
Trapeze is always good business.

233
00:25:00,442 --> 00:25:06,735
Chikki, where are the flames? I was
promised I would have fire on that hoop.

234
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,195
- It will take time.
- "Time"?

235
00:25:09,362 --> 00:25:12,321
Is opening night next year?
I want flames now.

236
00:25:12,447 --> 00:25:15,866
Last year it was jumping through knives.
Now you want fire.

237
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,159
You must go back to Mike.
I will kill Chikki for you.

238
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:25,203
Mr Bouglione, you will have the act I
promised. If I say flames, it will be flames.

239
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,954
Even if I was crazy enough,
the horse is not.

240
00:25:28,121 --> 00:25:31,331
That's your affair.
I am offered flames, I expect flames.

241
00:25:31,457 --> 00:25:34,875
<i>Rosa,
you are not watching the horse.</i>

242
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:37,041
Now, gently.

243
00:25:42,043 --> 00:25:44,795
<i>- Late time.
- I got off late?</i>

244
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,380
Too late off the board.

245
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:52,632
- How was the kip?
- You're kipping too early.

246
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,717
I had a bad grip on the bar.

247
00:25:54,884 --> 00:25:58,427
- Monsieur Bouglione?
- Eh? What? Yes?

248
00:25:59,636 --> 00:26:03,763
I apologise, monsieur.
You are right. It is a skilful act.

249
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:05,931
<i>Don't put your head down.</i>

250
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:08,974
But is skill enough?
Can the people appreciate it?

251
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:11,434
<i>- Kip still wrong?
- You're too late.</i>

252
00:26:11,559 --> 00:26:14,518
People like spangles,
you know, monsieur?

253
00:26:16,561 --> 00:26:20,480
- They are good for the imagination.
- You think about this act?

254
00:26:20,646 --> 00:26:24,940
- You already have an act.
- Not at the Cirque d'Hiver.

255
00:26:25,066 --> 00:26:28,442
What about your partners?
Don't you mind losing them?

256
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:31,402
Let them show me the agreement,
monsieur.

257
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:35,820
No. Mike Ribble always has a two act.
A two act is what he wants. Nothing else.

258
00:26:35,987 --> 00:26:40,615
And you, monsieur. Do you care
what the act is so long as they look?

259
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,158
That act might be great.
But the great ones are not easy to keep.

260
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:47,619
<i>- How was my head?
- Keep your head up.</i>

261
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:53,120
- They are always moving on.
- With you in it, I could keep this act, eh?

262
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,998
If I were a part of it,
I would be very loyal to you, monsieur.

263
00:26:57,165 --> 00:27:02,292
If you can become part of it, I would
appreciate your loyalty, mademoiselle.

264
00:27:02,417 --> 00:27:06,835
<i>- Was I slow on the break?
- You broke too late.</i>

265
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,755
- What did he say to the costume?
- New ones for all of us?

266
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:17,383
He never looked at it.
He's dropping our act. We are fired.

267
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:19,050
- Fired?
- It can't be.

268
00:27:19,175 --> 00:27:23,052
- The bill is full. We are out.
- Where is Bouglione? He can't do this.

269
00:27:23,176 --> 00:27:27,096
- I talked to him. It's a waste of breath.
- Then what do we do?

270
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:31,014
I was thinking, if we act quick
we might get a booking in Marseille.

271
00:27:31,181 --> 00:27:35,891
- It's her fault. Wanting more in the act.
- Lola's right. Marseille is our best bet.

272
00:27:36,016 --> 00:27:38,143
I wanted to go there in the first place.

273
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:42,395
Maybe it would be better if you
went ahead, then I could join you.

274
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,771
In case we don't get a booking,
it would save money.

275
00:27:45,938 --> 00:27:49,564
We have no time to waste here.
Let's get the rigging together.

276
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,732
<i>Ciao.</i>

277
00:27:56,026 --> 00:27:58,694
How are the hands?

278
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,028
Hot.

279
00:28:00,195 --> 00:28:03,447
Throw me a triple and we'll call it quits.

280
00:28:05,114 --> 00:28:09,949
- You mean it?
- There's always gotta be a first time.

281
00:28:10,116 --> 00:28:12,201
OK, you're the boss.

282
00:28:12,368 --> 00:28:17,745
Heads up down there.
Clear the ring for a minute. Heads up.

283
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:25,624
Now remember, don't fight that bar.

284
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,208
Your natural break will give you
all the height you need.

285
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,545
<i>- The beautiful women love brave boys.
- Ta gueule!</i>

286
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,920
And the great Chikki.

287
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:39,922
<i>Tu peux pas faire attention,
espèce d'imbécile?</i>

288
00:28:40,047 --> 00:28:42,090
Right.

289
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:49,635
<i>Hup!</i>

290
00:28:51,052 --> 00:28:54,014
- What's he up to?
- They're trying for a triple.

291
00:28:54,137 --> 00:28:56,264
Hup!

292
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:59,765
- What happened?
- I dunno, I... I froze.

293
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:04,225
You can't quit now, man.
Swallow the lump and let's go.

294
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,947
- Mike? You all right?
- I'm all right. I'm all right.

295
00:29:31,072 --> 00:29:35,074
You almost had it, kid.
You almost made it. Your first triple.

296
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,242
Yeah, but what was wrong?

297
00:29:37,409 --> 00:29:40,535
You broke too soon.
That's why you barrelled into me.

298
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,870
But the triple itself was perfect.

299
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:46,121
That one moment up there,
I knew what you were talkin' about.

300
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:49,081
Now you know why I've been
drivin' you so hard, huh?

301
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:52,207
We're gonna give 'em that triple
on opening night.

302
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:54,750
- Wanna try it again?
- No, no.

303
00:29:54,916 --> 00:30:00,003
Tomorrow, the next day, you can do all
you want. But now let's take the night off.

304
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:04,297
It's the young Orsini all right.
And the great old Ribble.

305
00:30:04,422 --> 00:30:09,425
Give him a rubdown, Max. And remember
you're workin' on pure gold. Alley-oop!

306
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:13,426
Come, Tino.
We put a good shine on the gold.

307
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:15,886
The boy's good, huh?

308
00:30:16,011 --> 00:30:19,512
At least it's good to see you smile again.

309
00:31:58,477 --> 00:32:02,729
- How do you like my costume?
- That's an awful lot of spangles.

310
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:07,022
It's for opening night.
I wanted to make sure it wouldn't split.

311
00:32:12,317 --> 00:32:18,237
It would be terrible if something happened
in front of all those people.

312
00:32:28,158 --> 00:32:34,161
It's a good idea to try it out on a fast spin.
If it'll stand that, it'll stand anything.

313
00:32:39,664 --> 00:32:43,165
Take a deep breath. Give it all you got.

314
00:32:48,418 --> 00:32:53,254
- The costume will split!
- Let me worry about the costume.

315
00:33:08,595 --> 00:33:13,346
- Sure wouldn't worry about that costume.
- My style is OK?

316
00:33:13,513 --> 00:33:16,432
On a rope there's nothing I can teach you.

317
00:33:18,349 --> 00:33:21,393
I want to learn all I can.

318
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:28,104
Maybe we should... talk about it.

319
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:33,356
Give me time to get out of this.

320
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:55,910
- Asleep?
- Shh.

321
00:34:02,537 --> 00:34:04,663
- Paul, a small bottle of brandy.
- Brandy?

322
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:07,248
And a couple of cups.

323
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,918
- 400 francs.
- Shh. I'll pay you tomorrow.

324
00:34:12,043 --> 00:34:15,211
- Maybe I'm dead tomorrow.
- I'll put the money in your coffin.

325
00:34:15,377 --> 00:34:18,545
I was dreaming I had a box
at the Folies Bergère.

326
00:34:18,712 --> 00:34:22,464
There were all these beautiful girls,
and one kept looking at me.

327
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:27,467
A little blonde with blue eyes? Take no
notice. I know her. She's not sympathetic.

328
00:34:27,633 --> 00:34:30,593
Go on back to sleep
and dream about the triple.

329
00:34:30,718 --> 00:34:33,385
- Where you going?
- Around.

330
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:36,387
- Wait, I'll come with you.
- Stay there. You need rest.

331
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:40,223
- I feel great.
- I know how you feel better than you do.

332
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,057
I'll see you around.

333
00:34:42,224 --> 00:34:45,558
Go back to sleep.
Your little blonde has a friend waiting.

334
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,392
She'll probably look like Mike.

335
00:34:56,648 --> 00:34:58,648
Come in.

336
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,902
Whatever kept you?

337
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,282
I hear the boy was very good today.

338
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:21,284
Good? He was great.
He missed the triple by an inch.

339
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:24,828
You should congratulate him.
You'll find him in the menagerie.

340
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:28,412
Let's drink to Ribble and Orsini,
the first pure act in years.

341
00:35:28,578 --> 00:35:32,998
Let's hope the public like it.
They never asked for purity before.

342
00:35:33,165 --> 00:35:37,751
- It's so long since they saw it, they forgot.
- No, Mike. Things have changed.

343
00:35:37,918 --> 00:35:42,962
Why stick to a two act? People want light,
sparkle, something pleasing to the eye.

344
00:35:43,129 --> 00:35:46,964
A bit of feminine beauty like Lola here.

345
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:50,965
Think it over, Mike,
while I go congratulate your boy.

346
00:35:51,841 --> 00:35:55,175
I have great hopes for this act.

347
00:36:00,678 --> 00:36:03,055
I watched you work.

348
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,390
Bouglione's wrong. Your way is right.

349
00:36:06,556 --> 00:36:09,890
- He knows box office.
- That's all he knows.

350
00:36:10,015 --> 00:36:14,935
That's all he cares.
The work itself he thinks nothing of.

351
00:36:15,102 --> 00:36:19,437
- That bothers you?
- Why not? He throws out my partners.

352
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:22,064
- They are not bad workers.
- They're good.

353
00:36:22,189 --> 00:36:26,941
All right. But they are not
in the same class as you.

354
00:36:34,695 --> 00:36:38,196
- I've got a great flier.
- Always the flier gets credit.

355
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:40,823
What he does makes a flash.

356
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:44,116
Your partner is nothing without you.

357
00:36:44,283 --> 00:36:48,201
My partners,
they can find work without me.

358
00:36:48,368 --> 00:36:52,912
But your Tino, he had to come
halfway round the world to find you.

359
00:36:53,037 --> 00:36:56,038
Does Bouglione appreciate it?

360
00:36:56,205 --> 00:36:59,582
- He sure appreciates you.
- Oh, me.

361
00:36:59,707 --> 00:37:04,084
He wants me to be like a bit
of window-dressing in some other act.

362
00:37:04,209 --> 00:37:06,377
You don't like that?

363
00:37:06,501 --> 00:37:10,754
All my life I wanted
to get better and better.

364
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,338
To be the best of all.

365
00:37:14,714 --> 00:37:16,715
Like you.

366
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:30,180
Our act's pretty dangerous.

367
00:37:30,305 --> 00:37:35,682
I don't care how dangerous,
so long as I am with the best.

368
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:38,225
With you, for example.

369
00:37:40,727 --> 00:37:45,145
- You think we could work well together?
- I know we could.

370
00:37:46,855 --> 00:37:49,981
- Can you stand heights?
- The higher the better.

371
00:37:50,148 --> 00:37:52,816
- How are your wrists?
- Strong enough.

372
00:37:52,983 --> 00:37:54,858
Legs?

373
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:58,986
I was always strong in the legs.

374
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,821
- How about your hocks?
- What?

375
00:38:03,988 --> 00:38:05,989
Here.

376
00:38:07,198 --> 00:38:09,200
Fine.

377
00:38:13,576 --> 00:38:16,369
You'll really fly high?

378
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,913
Because I'm not afraid of anything.

379
00:38:57,597 --> 00:39:01,933
But I am afraid.
That's why I'm stickin' to a two act.

380
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:11,020
<i>Ma chi ti credi di essere! Ma chi ti cerca!</i>

381
00:39:11,187 --> 00:39:16,398
<i>Egoista che non sei altro! Nemmeno se mi
dai un milione ci vengo nel numero tuo!</i>

382
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:24,361
<i>Brutto pallone gonfiato. Ti credi un artista,
ti credi. Lo sai cosa sei? Un pagliaccio!</i>

383
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:35,186
Good morning, uncle.
What makes you so tall?

384
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:40,940
Max, what are you doin'?
Keepin' banking hours?

385
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:44,150
My alarm clock was late going off.

386
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,527
You like that, don't you, baby?
She's a proper woman.

387
00:40:51,236 --> 00:40:54,070
Hey, take it easy.

388
00:40:55,155 --> 00:40:59,532
- You had a good time last night, eh?
- You know everything, don't you?

389
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:03,116
Brandy, two cups. You drink by yourself?

390
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,535
- You feel good, eh?
- I feel great.

391
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,661
- Who are you trying to fool?
- Otto!

392
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:11,622
I know you. You used to be
a catcher for Mike.

393
00:41:11,747 --> 00:41:14,956
Misser, you mean.
He couldn't catch a baby in a basket.

394
00:41:15,081 --> 00:41:18,291
That night your timing was so bad
I needed arms ten feet long.

395
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:20,292
- You're so right.
- Mike...

396
00:41:20,417 --> 00:41:24,169
This boy, Orsini. Hm? He's good?

397
00:41:24,336 --> 00:41:28,378
- Too good for you. Go get your own flier.
- There are no fliers today.

398
00:41:28,503 --> 00:41:32,380
- Harry, he needs an act. Sell him a snake.
- One? And break up the family?

399
00:41:32,505 --> 00:41:36,592
Snakes are affectionate, especially
girl snakes. They all go together.

400
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:41,761
Look, Mike, I do you a favour. You can't
work with that leg for long, that I know.

401
00:41:41,886 --> 00:41:46,096
So I catch him and I give you
a pension. How about it?

402
00:41:46,263 --> 00:41:51,265
- Max, wanna fly to him?
- I'm too heavy. I'd break his arms.

403
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:54,558
- I stick around, Mike.
- Do that. I'll buy you a beer later.

404
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:56,976
Here, how about a snake act up in the air?

405
00:41:57,101 --> 00:42:00,645
Clean and unusual family show.
Snakes are natural climbers.

406
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:05,397
When your snakes can fly
like this Tino, then I'm interested.

407
00:42:07,398 --> 00:42:09,440
Hup. Hup.

408
00:42:10,816 --> 00:42:16,152
<i>- Still worried about the height?
- Not when we're swinging together.</i>

409
00:42:16,277 --> 00:42:22,489
- You'd be good if you wanted to be a flier.
- I'm glad I asked you to take me up.

410
00:42:23,781 --> 00:42:28,824
Let the weight of your body carry you out.
Remember the trampoline. Same idea.

411
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,160
- The way you're catching on...
- Tino! What's she doing up there?

412
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:36,663
She's all right, Mike.
Watch her. She's good.

413
00:42:36,788 --> 00:42:38,329
Get her down.

414
00:42:38,454 --> 00:42:42,040
Don't get excited, Mike.
I just happened to run into her.

415
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:45,250
There's no room for more than two
up there. Now get her down.

416
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,418
Take it easy, Mike.
The girl looks good, eh?

417
00:42:49,544 --> 00:42:52,420
- Great, but not in my act.
- Let her do a simple trick.

418
00:42:52,546 --> 00:42:56,673
- Just drop the bar. What harm?
- Plenty. She'll ruin the act. Tino...

419
00:42:56,797 --> 00:43:00,382
I give you my word,
the act will be improved.

420
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:05,510
Improved? By a dame? I'm tryin'
to give you a pure trapeze act...

421
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,928
I know your act, its purity, its perfection.
I also know what the public wants.

422
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:13,388
- Money, money, always the money!
- You can eat for nothing?

423
00:43:13,555 --> 00:43:16,890
- What's Bouglione getting excited about?
- Don't argue over me.

424
00:43:17,057 --> 00:43:21,643
- Oh, no. I'll just go down...
- Tino, I hate quarrels. Stay, please.

425
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:25,811
It's unique in history, the greatest act
since Léotard invented trapeze

426
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:29,771
in this circus 100 years ago. And
you talk about box office and spangles.

427
00:43:29,896 --> 00:43:33,523
I buy the acts here, Mike.
I throw out what I don't like.

428
00:43:33,648 --> 00:43:36,692
We haven't got time.
We'd lose the triple opening night!

429
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:40,485
I buy the acts here.
That's all I want. No arguments.

430
00:43:40,652 --> 00:43:43,945
You think they'll pay more
to see her than to see a triple?

431
00:43:44,069 --> 00:43:47,864
I fill my circus in my way
or I empty it in my way.

432
00:43:47,989 --> 00:43:50,948
In my circus there's room
for only my way.

433
00:43:51,115 --> 00:43:56,868
Either the three of you are up there
opening night, or you're not there at all.

434
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,213
I don't understand.

435
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,840
You're in the act. You're part of the act.

436
00:44:41,014 --> 00:44:44,765
You wanna be in the act?
Come on over to me.

437
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:48,435
- Fly?!
- Just a simple straight jump.

438
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:52,395
I'll call your time from the board
and call you off the bar.

439
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:55,104
It's too soon. I can't.

440
00:44:55,271 --> 00:44:59,565
Don't worry. He'll catch you.
He's got great hands.

441
00:45:00,773 --> 00:45:02,400
Here.

442
00:45:02,525 --> 00:45:07,277
Use the bar, it'll give you
a better swing. Come on.

443
00:45:07,444 --> 00:45:09,444
Now don't worry.

444
00:45:16,031 --> 00:45:18,116
Hup!

445
00:45:24,911 --> 00:45:27,370
Higher. Get higher. All of it.

446
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,954
Come on.

447
00:45:31,872 --> 00:45:33,540
Hep!

448
00:45:34,458 --> 00:45:37,042
I did it! You caught me!

449
00:45:44,961 --> 00:45:48,923
Let's try it again.
This time get it up higher. All of it.

450
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:04,305
Mike, I wanna talk to you. Mike, you gotta
listen to me. We were just horsing around.

451
00:46:04,472 --> 00:46:08,015
- How did she get up there?
- I didn't mean to give Bouglione ideas.

452
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,350
She had the ideas. Now we've lost
the triple opening night.

453
00:46:11,475 --> 00:46:14,519
Mike, you don't know her.
She's had a rough life.

454
00:46:14,644 --> 00:46:19,187
Listen, you idiot. She gave me the
treatment before she got around to you.

455
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:21,563
Why do you think
I always wanted a two act?

456
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:27,066
Because one flies and one catches,
and no one comes between.

457
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:30,359
Nobody's gonna come between.

458
00:46:38,321 --> 00:46:41,781
- Is he still angry?
- Are you worried?

459
00:46:43,074 --> 00:46:46,951
I was thinking of his hands.
They give you so much confidence.

460
00:46:47,076 --> 00:46:49,702
Looks like you've had
enough of that already.

461
00:46:49,828 --> 00:46:52,286
Now you are angry too. Why?

462
00:46:52,412 --> 00:46:54,788
Why didn't you say
you already spoke to Mike?

463
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:59,707
I? He must have misunderstood.
It was Bouglione who was talking.

464
00:46:59,832 --> 00:47:01,999
Look.

465
00:47:02,166 --> 00:47:06,501
I came over here to learn the triple.
And I'm gonna learn it.

466
00:47:06,668 --> 00:47:11,087
- And you think I'd interfere with that?
- Mike thinks so.

467
00:47:11,254 --> 00:47:16,381
We gotta think alike. Neither one of us
is good without the other.

468
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:33,014
I knew nothing about these things, or
I'd never have let Bouglione persuade me.

469
00:47:33,181 --> 00:47:36,433
I'm frightened I will not be good for you.

470
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,101
I'm frightened I will hurt the act.

471
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:41,977
Goodbye, Tino.

472
00:47:42,102 --> 00:47:43,895
Lola...

473
00:47:44,019 --> 00:47:48,105
Tomorrow I should leave. My only chance
for an engagement is in Marseille.

474
00:47:48,272 --> 00:47:50,107
- With your old act?
- Of course.

475
00:47:50,273 --> 00:47:54,817
My partners have
great plans for me. It is just...

476
00:47:54,942 --> 00:48:00,945
I would rather have been a tiny part of a
great act than the star of an ordinary one.

477
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,988
- Please, Tino, we don't talk about it...
- Oh, Lola.

478
00:48:04,113 --> 00:48:06,989
Lola, stay. Don't go.

479
00:48:08,699 --> 00:48:13,117
When he was swinging me, he made
me feel I could do anything up there.

480
00:48:13,284 --> 00:48:16,202
You'll have to be happy
with a couple of simple tricks.

481
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,370
How could I ever dream of more?

482
00:48:18,537 --> 00:48:23,289
Want me to tell you your fortune?
Only 100 francs for young lovers...

483
00:48:23,456 --> 00:48:28,042
Shall we? I wonder if
she sees me with you on opening night.

484
00:48:38,212 --> 00:48:40,256
<i>Digli che saremo felici, eh?</i>

485
00:48:54,554 --> 00:48:59,182
- What is this we hear about Lola?
- Can't you see I'm busy?

486
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:28,737
Don't bother me. It's not my business.

487
00:49:28,904 --> 00:49:31,739
Good house tonight, Mr Bouglione.

488
00:49:31,906 --> 00:49:36,450
Ah, Mr Ringling North.
How can New York spare you so often?

489
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:39,868
Doesn't it worry you
to have others run your big circus?

490
00:49:39,993 --> 00:49:44,119
Always looking for something good.
Takes a lot of acts to fill my three rings.

491
00:49:44,244 --> 00:49:48,705
- Takes a lot of looking to find the best.
- I'm afraid we can't surprise you.

492
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:53,249
- I heard Mike Ribble has an act again.
- Ordinary, very ordinary.

493
00:49:53,415 --> 00:49:56,876
He must have found a good flier
to tempt Mike out of the rafters.

494
00:49:57,001 --> 00:50:00,795
An eager boy but without experience.
You wouldn't be interested.

495
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:05,673
If the new act's as classic as the old,
I'll be very interested.

496
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:10,424
- Mr Bouglione...
- Don't bother me. Talk to her.

497
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:12,592
<i>Yeah.</i>

498
00:50:23,013 --> 00:50:27,225
I feel as young as my first opening night.
I have the same ball in my stomach.

499
00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:29,558
- The hoop?
- Why do I hate fire so much?

500
00:50:29,684 --> 00:50:32,769
You go so fast, you never feel it.
It only looks dangerous.

501
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:34,936
Lola, look what I got for you.

502
00:50:35,103 --> 00:50:37,562
- It's pretty.
- My father wears one like it.

503
00:50:37,688 --> 00:50:41,982
He always says "Fear no trick,
for we are in strong hands."

504
00:50:44,524 --> 00:50:46,401
- It's for luck.
- Thank you.

505
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:49,735
You will need it, Lola. For all your tricks.

506
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:53,611
<i>Rosa, allez, dépêche-toi.
Qu'est-ce que tu attends?</i>

507
00:50:53,778 --> 00:50:55,780
<i>Allez, ouvrez.</i>

508
00:51:15,956 --> 00:51:18,374
You promised to join us
when we got a booking.

509
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,959
- We have one in Marseille.
- I'm happy for you.

510
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:24,210
- The booking is for the act. All four.
- Get someone else.

511
00:51:24,377 --> 00:51:27,587
<i>Impossible.</i>

512
00:51:39,217 --> 00:51:41,385
Get out. I said get out.

513
00:51:41,552 --> 00:51:45,596
She will leave you too. She will
spit on you just like she spit on us.

514
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:01,520
The costume's split.

515
00:52:03,146 --> 00:52:04,938
Mike...

516
00:52:05,063 --> 00:52:07,607
you didn't do that for the act.

517
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,568
I can remember when
those boys had a good act.

518
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:18,612
- Quiet, with no screaming, no fighting.
- Mike...

519
00:52:18,737 --> 00:52:23,907
Then you came. The routines and quality
went, but the spotlight stayed on you.

520
00:52:24,072 --> 00:52:27,575
Why must you hate me?
Why always hate?

521
00:52:27,742 --> 00:52:33,202
When this engagement ends, you're out.
Tino and me work alone, as we planned.

522
00:52:33,328 --> 00:52:38,955
With that stick you walk, but with Tino you
fly. You think you can live through Tino?

523
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,874
<i>- Ask Tino who makes him live.
- No more tricks, Lola. You're out.</i>

524
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:48,460
I could mean more to Tino than you.
I can take him whenever I want.

525
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,044
That trick I've still got.

526
00:52:52,086 --> 00:52:55,087
For your own sake, Lola, get out.

527
00:52:55,254 --> 00:52:57,923
Or one night these hands
won't be there to catch you.

528
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:04,467
<i>Allez-y doucement, bon Dieu!
Dégagez le passage, espèce d'idiot.</i>

529
00:53:04,592 --> 00:53:06,968
<i>Appelez-moi le vétérinaire
immédiatement.</i>

530
00:53:07,093 --> 00:53:09,969
- What happened?
- The flames. The horse shied.

531
00:53:10,094 --> 00:53:14,722
<i>Pepe! Bobo! Max! In the ring!
Make plenty of noise! Allez!</i>

532
00:53:16,598 --> 00:53:22,059
All right. We follow with the bears. Why
aren't the bears ready? Forget the bears.

533
00:53:22,184 --> 00:53:24,353
- Mike, your act goes on next.
- Tino. Lola.

534
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:30,647
Put out that net for the flying act. Get this
horse out. Girls, don't stand there! Places!

535
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:33,774
<i>Avance, Lucien.
Foutez-moi le camp de là-dedans!</i>

536
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:42,069
- What happened?
- All that hurry, I slipped on the stairs.

537
00:53:42,194 --> 00:53:44,487
- Let me look.
- It's nothing. It's nothing!

538
00:53:44,612 --> 00:53:47,238
Why are you getting so excited?
You must do...

539
00:53:47,363 --> 00:53:49,406
<i>Tino.</i>

540
00:56:33,694 --> 00:56:35,987
You did that. You killed him.

541
00:56:36,112 --> 00:56:39,405
Chikki, it was the flames. I told you before.

542
00:56:39,530 --> 00:56:43,532
Why should I waste my talent,
my horse and my life on such a woman?

543
00:56:43,698 --> 00:56:45,366
Why should you?

544
00:56:45,533 --> 00:56:48,785
I leave. Right now, I leave.

545
00:57:34,057 --> 00:57:38,058
How many more years you gonna
keep on watching him, Otto?

546
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:43,436
Not much longer.
The boy flies in like a cannonball.

547
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,729
He needs two good legs.

548
00:57:47,146 --> 00:57:48,897
Ready?

549
00:58:38,254 --> 00:58:40,338
Hear them? That's for you.

550
00:58:40,505 --> 00:58:42,924
- Shall I go again?
- You know Mike.

551
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:46,134
Better stick to what we rehearsed.

552
00:59:01,933 --> 00:59:04,392
- Nice style, the boy.
- Not bad.

553
00:59:04,517 --> 00:59:09,394
The last time I saw Mike work was the
night he fell. Good to see him back again.

554
01:00:16,635 --> 01:00:20,554
Gee, Mike, that was great.
Just like old times.

555
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:32,018
Hey, that ain't in the act.

556
01:01:08,994 --> 01:01:14,164
- You shouldn't have done that.
- It was worth it. Listen to them.

557
01:01:26,336 --> 01:01:29,213
Just one photograph, please.

558
01:01:30,338 --> 01:01:32,339
Quite still.

559
01:01:37,508 --> 01:01:39,885
Is this how you spell Orsini?

560
01:01:40,009 --> 01:01:45,053
Tomorrow we sign a contract.
All three. I count on your loyalty.

561
01:01:48,097 --> 01:01:50,847
Hey, Mr North. Look here, remember me?

562
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:55,767
Sure I remember you.
Madison Square Garden.

563
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:59,268
America has everything so big,
you must be short of dwarfs.

564
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:01,520
Dwarf acts are well liked in America.

565
01:02:01,687 --> 01:02:04,188
Times change,
but you're a born professional.

566
01:02:04,355 --> 01:02:06,522
- That's what I like.
- Certainly.

567
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:09,691
Professionals can always come back,
like Mike Ribble.

568
01:02:09,857 --> 01:02:12,275
Mr John! I was hoping
you'd be here tonight.

569
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:14,902
Well, you look in good shape, boy.

570
01:02:15,026 --> 01:02:18,236
Fine, fine. Tell me,
how did you like the boy?

571
01:02:18,361 --> 01:02:21,946
I was watching the girl after I found out
I wasn't gonna see a triple.

572
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:24,531
You would have if the act
wasn't overcrowded.

573
01:02:24,698 --> 01:02:28,074
Knowing you, Mike,
how did she ever get there?

574
01:02:28,199 --> 01:02:32,994
Tino! Come here. I want you
to meet someone. Mr John Ringling North.

575
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:37,870
- A pleasure, Mr North.
- Hello, Tino.

576
01:02:38,037 --> 01:02:42,123
- Mike says you've got a triple in you.
- We'd like to show it to you.

577
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:46,083
Show me in the next three weeks,
and I'll take it to New York.

578
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:51,127
Ribble and Orsini. I've kept that contract
on ice a long time for you, Mike.

579
01:02:51,294 --> 01:02:53,878
<i>Hello, Monsieur North.
Comment allez-vous?</i>

580
01:02:54,045 --> 01:02:56,588
I didn't hear my name mentioned.

581
01:02:58,715 --> 01:03:01,299
Can you do a triple?

582
01:03:01,465 --> 01:03:03,466
Can you?

583
01:03:12,887 --> 01:03:14,930
Tino, the parade's starting!

584
01:03:15,055 --> 01:03:18,890
- I'll be right back. Lola...
- Oh, don't touch me now. Don't touch me!

585
01:03:19,057 --> 01:03:23,310
I'll talk to Mike. I'm sure we can
work out something. Lola, please...

586
01:03:23,476 --> 01:03:27,145
Go with Mike to New York.
That's what you want.

587
01:03:28,478 --> 01:03:30,397
- Lola...
- Parade!

588
01:03:33,732 --> 01:03:35,566
Lola...

589
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:43,819
I'll talk to Mike.

590
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:49,114
It doesn't matter what anyone says
to Mike. Can't you see?

591
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:51,615
He's jealous.

592
01:03:51,740 --> 01:03:54,617
He knows I... I love you.

593
01:03:55,992 --> 01:03:58,535
The fortune-teller was right.

594
01:04:03,078 --> 01:04:04,914
Lola...

595
01:04:14,752 --> 01:04:16,919
Oh, Tino.

596
01:04:17,085 --> 01:04:19,462
He saw it from the start.

597
01:04:19,587 --> 01:04:24,797
Right from the start he saw
he might lose the only life he has.

598
01:04:24,923 --> 01:04:27,715
The life you give him.

599
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:32,593
It frightens me to think
what he could do to us, Tino.

600
01:04:33,677 --> 01:04:36,137
You are the flier.

601
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:38,304
You make the act.

602
01:04:38,429 --> 01:04:40,889
You must make the decisions.

603
01:04:45,516 --> 01:04:47,642
- Goodbye, Mr John.
- Parade!

604
01:04:47,767 --> 01:04:51,269
- Where's Tino?
- I don't know. I didn't see him.

605
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:54,354
Tino! Tino!

606
01:04:56,271 --> 01:04:58,731
Where is that boy?

607
01:05:08,361 --> 01:05:11,112
Tino! Tino!

608
01:05:11,695 --> 01:05:13,363
Tino!

609
01:05:36,542 --> 01:05:38,375
Tino! Lola!

610
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,876
Tino! Lola!

611
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:50,381
Ribble! Get your chariot out of the way.

612
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:00,928
Take it out of the parade, Mike. When you
get your act together, join in at the rear.

613
01:06:01,053 --> 01:06:03,595
Everybody in position!

614
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,972
Hurry up. Hurry up.

615
01:06:06,138 --> 01:06:08,139
Back. Back.

616
01:06:18,144 --> 01:06:20,980
<i>Two by two. Right and left.</i>

617
01:06:22,313 --> 01:06:25,398
All the acts together, right and left.

618
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:10,170
Try 'em anytime.
Take 'em home for the weekend.

619
01:07:10,336 --> 01:07:12,754
<i>I think you should.</i>

620
01:07:12,921 --> 01:07:15,422
I'm sorry about the horse, Rosa.

621
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:20,133
- Mike is trying to sell me on the snakes.
- She'd be great with a snake act.

622
01:07:20,258 --> 01:07:23,302
What about our act? Why are you
so anxious to get rid of Lola?

623
01:07:23,427 --> 01:07:27,553
- It's easy to get rid of Lola.
- Look, Mike...

624
01:07:29,846 --> 01:07:31,889
- I've decided...
- Ribble and Orsini.

625
01:07:32,014 --> 01:07:34,055
- We teamed up right here.
- What...

626
01:07:34,181 --> 01:07:39,350
Or Orsini and Ribble. However you put it,
it's the same. Till she came along.

627
01:07:39,517 --> 01:07:42,060
- She didn't change anything for me.
- You?

628
01:07:42,186 --> 01:07:46,021
She's not interested in you, me
or the act. Just Lola, that's all.

629
01:07:46,188 --> 01:07:49,563
The more you give, the more she'll want.
She's ruined acts before.

630
01:07:49,688 --> 01:07:53,899
- You can't even begin to see her clearly!
- I can see you, though.

631
01:07:54,024 --> 01:07:57,318
I see you forgetting to check the rigging,
missing parades.

632
01:07:57,443 --> 01:08:01,904
Next, you'll duck practice. You'll think
of her in the middle of a triple and lose it.

633
01:08:02,029 --> 01:08:05,404
I think about her all the time.
Just like I think about the triple.

634
01:08:05,529 --> 01:08:09,990
Tino, listen to me. You're
the only man living who can get the triple.

635
01:08:10,115 --> 01:08:14,618
But her, Tino. Anybody can get her. Can't
you understand? Anybody can get her!

636
01:08:14,784 --> 01:08:16,786
Shut up!

637
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:23,748
I'll work with you, Mike. I'll work
for the triple until my hands burn off.

638
01:08:23,873 --> 01:08:26,540
But you force me to choose
and I'll leave you.

639
01:08:26,707 --> 01:08:30,125
I want Lola most of all, because I love her.

640
01:08:31,292 --> 01:08:34,252
And she loves me.

641
01:08:37,462 --> 01:08:40,296
Mike, you can't keep that boy
locked to the trapeze.

642
01:08:40,463 --> 01:08:42,799
Let him dream a little.

643
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:47,675
- There goes the triple.
- He'll come back to it.

644
01:08:47,801 --> 01:08:50,927
- Give him time.
- It's too late. You heard him.

645
01:08:51,052 --> 01:08:53,178
Oh, how blind can you be?

646
01:08:53,303 --> 01:08:56,888
It is not Tino she wants to fly to. It is you.

647
01:09:01,724 --> 01:09:04,892
- What did you say?
- It is not Tino she loves.

648
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:07,268
It is you.

649
01:09:27,319 --> 01:09:29,279
How do you know?

650
01:09:29,405 --> 01:09:33,615
Mike, haven't I been
through the whole trick myself?

651
01:09:33,739 --> 01:09:35,782
Shouldn't I know?

652
01:09:44,912 --> 01:09:47,705
- I hope you're right, Rosa.
- I know I'm right.

653
01:09:47,830 --> 01:09:51,748
Because if you are,
you've just given me the triple.

654
01:10:13,259 --> 01:10:15,093
- Three eight.
- I checked it.

655
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,553
My passport says three foot
seven and a half. Now three eight?

656
01:10:18,678 --> 01:10:21,929
Maybe the tape is short.
Bouglione saves money on everything.

657
01:10:22,096 --> 01:10:26,807
I can't understand it. None of my family
is over three foot six. It embarrassed me.

658
01:10:26,932 --> 01:10:31,892
- Now three foot eight?
- Bend at the knees. No one will know.

659
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,731
- Good morning.
- Mademoiselle.

660
01:10:39,856 --> 01:10:43,732
For five days a contract has been on
my desk. Nobody comes to sign it. Why?

661
01:10:43,857 --> 01:10:46,357
You should speak to Mike Ribble.

662
01:10:46,524 --> 01:10:49,235
You suppose I did not see him
with Ringling North?

663
01:10:49,359 --> 01:10:52,278
Then speak to Tino.
I am very unimportant.

664
01:10:52,445 --> 01:10:56,738
Do not play games with me. I put you in
the act. I count on you to keep it for me.

665
01:10:56,863 --> 01:11:00,782
I owe you nothing. Someday I send you
a postcard from New York.

666
01:11:00,948 --> 01:11:03,950
Mike takes you to New York?
You have a lot to learn about him.

667
01:11:04,117 --> 01:11:08,660
So? I think he has already learned much
about me, and now we get on very well.

668
01:11:08,785 --> 01:11:14,788
For an ambitious girl you surprise me.
Tino is the act. Tino is your meal ticket.

669
01:11:14,955 --> 01:11:17,789
Without Tino you have nothing.

670
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:20,334
Remember that.

671
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:22,917
I will not forget, monsieur.

672
01:11:26,210 --> 01:11:29,755
Otto, I think maybe
you'd better catch the boy.

673
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:34,423
Mike and I, we are friends.
I wait until his leg drops off.

674
01:11:39,217 --> 01:11:42,510
- Had enough, Mike?
- North's due any day, Tino.

675
01:11:42,636 --> 01:11:47,804
We've got to show him that triple.
Now, let's give it another try.

676
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:52,015
Tino, has Mike said
any more about New York?

677
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:55,100
No, but he said he's got
a new trick for you.

678
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:58,101
Are you gonna show me a triple or not?

679
01:11:58,268 --> 01:12:00,603
Sorry, Mike. Next swing.

680
01:12:07,898 --> 01:12:11,359
Your timing's way off.
Your mind's not on your work.

681
01:12:11,483 --> 01:12:17,319
Take the day off. Figure out what you
did wrong. Tomorrow we make it perfect.

682
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:26,574
Come on, we'll work on a new trick.

683
01:12:26,741 --> 01:12:30,326
- What we try?
- A pirouette back to the bar.

684
01:12:30,492 --> 01:12:33,160
You are joking.
I am not ready for a pirouette.

685
01:12:33,243 --> 01:12:38,996
Why not? You wanna be a flier, don't you?
A bird's nest across and a pirouette back.

686
01:12:39,163 --> 01:12:41,247
All right.

687
01:12:41,414 --> 01:12:42,790
<i>Hup!</i>

688
01:13:14,846 --> 01:13:17,889
Mike, be fair. Let them alone.

689
01:13:18,014 --> 01:13:19,641
- You brought it up.
- Mike...

690
01:13:19,766 --> 01:13:21,809
Mind your business.

691
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:30,729
All night long, you hardly talked.
Is something wrong?

692
01:13:30,854 --> 01:13:36,233
There's nothing wrong. I talked.
We talked a lot about the act.

693
01:13:36,358 --> 01:13:40,442
When we're together,
I want to talk about you.

694
01:13:43,443 --> 01:13:45,946
Oh, Lola, I don't wanna t...

695
01:13:58,285 --> 01:14:00,494
It's getting late.

696
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:04,746
It's so good to be alone with you.
Just the two of us.

697
01:14:06,706 --> 01:14:10,749
Three shows today,
three shows tomorrow. I am tired.

698
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:13,584
You must be tired too.

699
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,751
We work hard.

700
01:14:17,378 --> 01:14:20,713
- Suddenly you're so tired.
- Oh, don't be angry, Tino.

701
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:24,255
Let things happen in their own time.

702
01:14:25,381 --> 01:14:29,925
When could there be a better time?
Lola, we're in love with each other.

703
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:32,677
Oh, not now, Tino. Please.

704
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:35,261
Please, you must let me go.

705
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:40,471
Good night now.
Let me kiss you good night.

706
01:14:42,557 --> 01:14:44,724
Lola...

707
01:14:44,891 --> 01:14:47,642
you did mean everything you said?

708
01:14:48,893 --> 01:14:51,227
Didn't you?

709
01:14:51,394 --> 01:14:53,769
You haven't changed?

710
01:14:53,895 --> 01:14:56,146
I haven't changed.

711
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,350
This is over before it begins.

712
01:16:12,517 --> 01:16:14,975
You didn't come down here to tell me that.

713
01:16:15,142 --> 01:16:18,186
We see each other on the bars.
Nowhere else.

714
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:23,481
- Is that what you want?
- You want a triple. I know what I want.

715
01:16:31,692 --> 01:16:34,401
You don't love Tino. You never did.

716
01:16:34,527 --> 01:16:38,279
- Suppose I tell him that.
- He would never believe you.

717
01:16:38,446 --> 01:16:41,656
He'd believe you. Why don't you tell him?

718
01:16:41,781 --> 01:16:44,824
I like working in the act.

719
01:16:44,949 --> 01:16:49,118
Sooner or later he has to know.
Tell him before he finds out.

720
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:13,213
Have you ever worked
in an Italian carnival?

721
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:16,297
Two cars and a tent with holes in it.

722
01:17:16,464 --> 01:17:22,259
Where sometimes you eat, but not if it
rains or a tyre blows out or the lion dies.

723
01:17:22,384 --> 01:17:27,344
Where you are never paid, because
if you had bus fare you might leave.

724
01:17:27,469 --> 01:17:29,680
All my life...

725
01:17:29,805 --> 01:17:35,181
You think I don't remember it? You think
I am fool enough to take chances now?

726
01:17:35,348 --> 01:17:37,683
Tell him.

727
01:17:37,808 --> 01:17:41,226
Stop. I want you to stop.

728
01:17:41,393 --> 01:17:44,061
Tell him. You've got to tell him.

729
01:17:45,812 --> 01:17:48,355
This has to finish. It has to.

730
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,940
I don't want to love you.

731
01:17:54,483 --> 01:17:56,900
You must let it finish.

732
01:17:57,067 --> 01:17:59,110
I can't.

733
01:17:59,235 --> 01:18:02,027
Please. Let it all finish now.

734
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:06,029
You know it can't finish like this.

735
01:18:13,242 --> 01:18:17,535
You're wise to remember that
it is the flier who's important.

736
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:21,036
"Wise". Always I've had to be wise.

737
01:18:21,203 --> 01:18:23,955
You're not pleased with my offer?

738
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:28,708
When you can give me Madison
Square Garden, then I'll be pleased.

739
01:18:28,833 --> 01:18:33,793
Meanwhile I'll accept
because our act cannot go on as it is.

740
01:18:35,086 --> 01:18:36,794
There are personal reasons.

741
01:18:40,255 --> 01:18:45,508
Perfect. A split second sooner and you'd
have a triple. We'll give it to them tonight.

742
01:18:45,675 --> 01:18:49,092
I have seen the personal reasons.

743
01:18:49,259 --> 01:18:54,888
- It is not good that it happened this way.
- You want the boy, Otto. Don't complain.

744
01:18:55,429 --> 01:18:59,431
You're sure that Tino
will break with Ribble?

745
01:18:59,598 --> 01:19:03,057
Tino chose me before. He will again.

746
01:19:06,267 --> 01:19:08,727
Chikki, you're back. Is that the new horse?

747
01:19:08,852 --> 01:19:11,936
Just arrived. Got a surprise for Rosa.

748
01:19:13,021 --> 01:19:17,231
Beautiful. Perfect. I wouldn't part
with them if I wasn't allergic to snakes.

749
01:19:17,356 --> 01:19:20,900
- What about me?
- If you don't come out in spots in a day,

750
01:19:21,025 --> 01:19:24,693
you've got a lovely new act.
Gotta hand it to Mike, it was a great idea.

751
01:19:24,818 --> 01:19:27,110
I bring you a magnificent horse.

752
01:19:27,277 --> 01:19:32,280
He feels nothing. Not knives, not flames,
nothing. And I find you with snakes.

753
01:19:32,447 --> 01:19:35,866
Always you want me to do more.
Now a new horse to break my back.

754
01:19:36,033 --> 01:19:38,492
- I stay with the snakes.
- You don't fool me.

755
01:19:38,617 --> 01:19:44,244
You stay with Mike Ribble. Where is he?
When I was away you went back to him!

756
01:20:03,796 --> 01:20:07,839
- Where's Tino?
- You decided to tell him about last night?

757
01:20:07,963 --> 01:20:11,799
I just made my decision. I leave the act.

758
01:20:15,927 --> 01:20:19,136
What are you gonna do?
Go back to your old act?

759
01:20:19,303 --> 01:20:22,513
No. To my new one, with Tino.

760
01:20:28,974 --> 01:20:31,476
- Lola.
- You make a fool of me with my wife.

761
01:20:31,643 --> 01:20:33,893
You can't do that. Nobody can do it.

762
01:20:34,060 --> 01:20:37,520
- What did you say?
- You hear me?

763
01:21:43,593 --> 01:21:45,803
Where's my cane?

764
01:21:47,762 --> 01:21:50,431
Get the first-aid box. Quick.

765
01:22:32,952 --> 01:22:34,994
I will make up my own mind about the act.

766
01:22:35,119 --> 01:22:39,662
Mr Bouglione, you speak to her. I can
do nothing. She refuses to work with me.

767
01:22:39,787 --> 01:22:41,706
That's right, order me to do it.

768
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:45,666
You turn lions loose, you ruin my
reputation, then ask me for favours.

769
01:22:45,790 --> 01:22:48,626
Escaped lions give him pleasure.
He loves danger.

770
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:52,169
He enjoys bending iron bars
with his beautiful body.

771
01:22:52,294 --> 01:22:55,754
Mr Bouglione, you sent for me.
Was Mike badly hurt? Is he all right?

772
01:22:55,879 --> 01:23:01,299
A scratch, nothing more. In your act,
nobody is necessary except the flier.

773
01:23:01,466 --> 01:23:07,719
It's your signature I want on the contract.
You lose nothing if you get rid of Ribble.

774
01:23:07,844 --> 01:23:11,053
- Get rid of Mike?
- You and she are a beautiful act.

775
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:15,639
You need nobody else.
Didn't Lola tell you our plan?

776
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:21,600
Mike looks after business.
You talk to Mike about your plans.

777
01:23:21,725 --> 01:23:26,852
Mike is too busy to speak. Your other,
beautiful partner is with him.

778
01:23:26,977 --> 01:23:29,270
- Leave him to her.
- Lola's with him?

779
01:23:29,395 --> 01:23:32,064
Sure she's with him.

780
01:23:32,230 --> 01:23:35,941
She can handle him.
She can handle all of us.

781
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:39,775
Uh...

782
01:23:39,900 --> 01:23:44,819
- Where are they?
- First you worry for Mike, now for Lola.

783
01:23:44,986 --> 01:23:47,029
Don't worry.

784
01:23:47,154 --> 01:23:50,614
- What have I got to be worried about?
- Exactly.

785
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:52,782
Let us be discreet and forget them.

786
01:23:52,907 --> 01:23:56,450
You'd say anything to make me sign.
Even put me against Mike.

787
01:23:56,575 --> 01:24:00,661
My dear young man,
if I wished to put you against Mike

788
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:04,329
I would tell you,
follow the old woman with his cane.

789
01:24:05,579 --> 01:24:08,665
But I don't. I say let us be discreet,

790
01:24:09,581 --> 01:24:12,500
and businesslike.

791
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:18,878
I understand. You wish to leave
all your business to Mike, eh?

792
01:24:19,003 --> 01:24:21,045
Well, please yourself.

793
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:26,548
I'm sure he's looking after it very well.
Very well indeed.

794
01:24:48,017 --> 01:24:52,102
Pierre, leave word with Mike Ribble
I'll be here tonight.

795
01:24:55,228 --> 01:24:59,606
<i>Allez, ma jolie, un kilo de mes carottes.
De la carotte, bien fraîche.</i>

796
01:24:59,772 --> 01:25:02,023
<i>Approchez! Voyez nos belles poires.</i>

797
01:25:02,190 --> 01:25:06,568
<i>Belles, juteuses, à emporter,
tout de suite, allez.</i>

798
01:25:06,693 --> 01:25:10,069
<i>Elle est belle, elle est belle, ma tomate.</i>

799
01:25:10,194 --> 01:25:16,406
<i>Les bananes. 100 francs le kilo
de bananes. Achetez mes belles bananes.</i>

800
01:25:20,740 --> 01:25:25,618
<i>Voyez les beaux melons de Cavaillon,
mesdames. Beaux melons de Cavaillon.</i>

801
01:25:25,785 --> 01:25:29,037
<i>Achetez un kilo de pêches,
100 francs le kilo.</i>

802
01:25:50,131 --> 01:25:52,131
<i>Entrez.</i>

803
01:26:02,303 --> 01:26:05,971
<i>Alors, vous I'avez trouvée cette canne?
II vous attend là-haut.</i>

804
01:26:06,096 --> 01:26:09,849
<i>Hé bien, qu'est-ce qu'on vous sert?</i>

805
01:26:09,974 --> 01:26:12,808
<i>Monsieur? Qu'est-ce qu'on vous sert?</i>

806
01:26:12,975 --> 01:26:14,976
A beer.

807
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:06,417
We must tell Tino.

808
01:27:06,542 --> 01:27:09,002
Not yet. Not yet.

809
01:27:09,127 --> 01:27:13,254
We must. You know we must.
You said we must.

810
01:27:16,672 --> 01:27:18,673
Last night.

811
01:27:20,258 --> 01:27:22,467
How do I explain last night?

812
01:27:22,634 --> 01:27:25,969
What are you trying to tell me?

813
01:27:26,094 --> 01:27:28,345
I thought we met, but we hadn't.

814
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:31,180
I thought I knew you,
but I didn't know you.

815
01:27:31,263 --> 01:27:34,723
I'm trying to tell you that...

816
01:27:34,848 --> 01:27:38,016
I'm trying to tell you how much I love you.

817
01:27:38,183 --> 01:27:41,726
I want you to know, in this one moment,
if only for this one moment,

818
01:27:41,893 --> 01:27:45,645
that for the first time
in a long time, I feel alive.

819
01:27:45,770 --> 01:27:47,813
Oh, Mike.

820
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:56,858
Tino will forgive you. Maybe he'll never
forgive me, but in time he will you.

821
01:27:58,567 --> 01:28:00,611
Not now, he wouldn't.

822
01:28:00,736 --> 01:28:03,445
Maybe once, but not now.

823
01:28:11,616 --> 01:28:14,992
<i>Elle est belle, eh? C'est moi.</i>

824
01:28:15,118 --> 01:28:18,202
<i>Ne soyez pas triste, c'est pas si important.</i>

825
01:28:41,965 --> 01:28:44,632
<i>L'addition, s'il vous plaît.</i>

826
01:28:50,051 --> 01:28:52,052
Hello, Mike.

827
01:29:03,224 --> 01:29:05,684
You know this place?

828
01:29:05,851 --> 01:29:08,893
It's got a machine I've never beaten.

829
01:29:12,812 --> 01:29:17,106
- How's the arm?
- It's OK, it's OK.

830
01:29:17,273 --> 01:29:21,775
Did you have somebody
to look after it for you?

831
01:29:23,650 --> 01:29:27,569
Make that one behind the gate,
and you got it.

832
01:29:27,735 --> 01:29:33,363
Toughest ones are always behind the
gate. You gotta be cagey to make 'em.

833
01:29:34,156 --> 01:29:37,241
Tilt it a little, maybe it'll...

834
01:29:37,408 --> 01:29:40,242
Yeah, you can cheat it.

835
01:29:43,243 --> 01:29:45,703
Then you lose the game.

836
01:29:52,206 --> 01:29:58,375
- Let's shove off. I'll get my jacket.
- Let me see if I can win... before we go.

837
01:29:59,918 --> 01:30:02,003
You can't beat it, kid.

838
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,928
You had to prove it, didn't you?

839
01:30:20,095 --> 01:30:22,513
You just had to win.

840
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:30,016
I'm sorry it happened this way.
I wanted to tell you...

841
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:33,768
We meant to tell you, but...

842
01:30:35,770 --> 01:30:38,896
All right, tell me.
Go ahead and tell me. Tell me what?

843
01:30:39,063 --> 01:30:42,439
- Not now, Tino.
- Then let me tell you what he said.

844
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:46,357
"Tino" he said. "You're the only man
in the world that can get a triple."

845
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:50,485
"But her? Anybody can get her."
That's what he said.

846
01:30:50,610 --> 01:30:54,320
- No, it's not true, Tino.
- Go ahead, deny it!

847
01:30:54,445 --> 01:30:58,238
He never wanted you in the act. He swore
he'd get you out any way he could.

848
01:30:58,405 --> 01:31:01,907
Even if he had to take you away from me.

849
01:31:02,032 --> 01:31:05,617
- What's he trying to say, Mike?
- Tell her!

850
01:31:11,119 --> 01:31:13,163
Tell her! Don't you want her to hear it?

851
01:31:13,288 --> 01:31:15,663
- You shouted it loud enough.
- Not now, Tino.

852
01:31:15,789 --> 01:31:19,415
I'm up to here with your words about
a two act, a triple and its purity.

853
01:31:19,540 --> 01:31:22,501
I'm chokin' at the way you
made her look lousy in my eyes.

854
01:31:22,626 --> 01:31:24,793
But you said it could be done, didn't you?

855
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:28,961
Tell her the price you put on her. Tell her
how you said anybody could have her.

856
01:31:29,128 --> 01:31:31,797
- Anybody, because she was a cheap...
- Lola...

857
01:31:36,131 --> 01:31:38,133
I love you.

858
01:31:48,389 --> 01:31:50,847
Tino...

859
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:54,683
You know why I don't kill you?
Because I wanna see you a rigger again.

860
01:31:54,808 --> 01:31:58,685
I want you watching me up there
with Otto. I've forgotten you, rigger.

861
01:31:58,810 --> 01:32:01,352
Try to forget me!

862
01:32:04,478 --> 01:32:06,438
Chikki and Rosa on yet?

863
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:10,524
Ah, Monsieur North.
We're always pleased to see you.

864
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:13,609
You need not have brought a pen.
The boy will be mine.

865
01:32:13,734 --> 01:32:16,860
- You'll see no triple tonight.
- You've signed him?

866
01:32:16,985 --> 01:32:20,987
I sent Otto, not Mike, up there tonight.
Tino will sign with me.

867
01:32:21,153 --> 01:32:25,072
You had a good dinner? I don't want
your evening to be a complete failure.

868
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:30,157
Most kind of you, but an evening
in Paris is always a pleasure.

869
01:32:33,576 --> 01:32:37,036
- You said he was not coming.
- Don't worry, I'll handle him.

870
01:32:37,161 --> 01:32:39,620
You go in and change.

871
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:48,959
The boy wants Otto, he's got Otto. You're
through, you're finished. Understand?

872
01:32:49,084 --> 01:32:51,460
You can't do that. Mr North is coming.

873
01:32:51,585 --> 01:32:57,630
<i>What are you doing here while the show
is on? Get back to the stables. Vite.</i>

874
01:32:57,755 --> 01:33:02,382
I can remember when you were interested
only in circus. Think back, Bouglione.

875
01:33:02,507 --> 01:33:05,675
Give me this night. Just this one night.

876
01:33:05,842 --> 01:33:10,553
I warned you before. I'm only interested
in the public, not in Ringling North.

877
01:33:10,677 --> 01:33:13,138
Now get out of those skins.

878
01:33:17,764 --> 01:33:21,891
That's the way we'll keep it
for tonight. I'll tell her.

879
01:33:25,852 --> 01:33:29,187
After tonight, make your own plans.
We keep the routine simple.

880
01:33:29,354 --> 01:33:32,022
You do the somersault
and we do the passing trick.

881
01:33:32,105 --> 01:33:35,481
He's coming, Tino. Ringling North.
You've got to work with me...

882
01:33:35,606 --> 01:33:39,066
- I'll go check the rigging.
- Tino...

883
01:33:44,361 --> 01:33:46,320
I did this to him.

884
01:33:46,445 --> 01:33:49,405
We did. You and I.

885
01:33:50,864 --> 01:33:55,033
But it's not Tino you think of now,
it's yourself.

886
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:58,284
You'd like to make up for the time you fell.

887
01:33:58,451 --> 01:34:01,660
You don't care who you hurt,
who you destroy,

888
01:34:01,785 --> 01:34:04,079
as long as you make that good at last.

889
01:34:06,538 --> 01:34:10,207
That was true once, but not after today.

890
01:34:11,540 --> 01:34:15,001
Maybe I was in love with you
all the time and never knew it.

891
01:34:15,126 --> 01:34:17,585
But suddenly I knew it.

892
01:34:17,710 --> 01:34:21,879
- And it was too late.
- Oh, please. I listened to you before.

893
01:34:24,047 --> 01:34:26,380
Forget me, but not Tino.

894
01:34:26,547 --> 01:34:31,675
Speak to Bouglione. Get him to talk to
the boy. He'll do it for you, you know that.

895
01:34:32,717 --> 01:34:36,510
I know you promised me love,
and gave me a twisted moment.

896
01:34:36,636 --> 01:34:39,846
You promised Tino greatness
and gave him empty words.

897
01:34:39,971 --> 01:34:43,431
So leave me alone, and leave Tino to Otto.

898
01:34:43,556 --> 01:34:48,309
- We can't. Not like this. For Tino...
- Let Otto catch him.

899
01:34:55,646 --> 01:34:59,773
I told you. A magnificent horse.
What a judge I am.

900
01:34:59,898 --> 01:35:03,066
Yes, Chikki.
You know everything about horses.

901
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:39,779
Otto will never give you that triple.
You've got to give yourself this chance.

902
01:36:46,950 --> 01:36:49,450
Get off that bar.

903
01:36:49,617 --> 01:36:53,202
Ribble and Orsini. Remember, Tino?

904
01:36:53,369 --> 01:36:55,787
Please, Tino. Let's go down.

905
01:36:55,954 --> 01:36:58,621
Get off that bar before I knock you off.

906
01:36:58,705 --> 01:37:01,665
All right. Try and do it.

907
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,833
You asked for it.

908
01:37:21,049 --> 01:37:23,383
John Ringling North's down there.

909
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:29,469
Let's show him some real circus.
Let's give him a triple. Come on.

910
01:37:39,391 --> 01:37:43,268
You're not giving up, are you? I thought
you had nerve. What's happened to it?

911
01:37:43,393 --> 01:37:46,020
- Stop, Tino. He's not sane.
- Shut up.

912
01:37:53,231 --> 01:37:54,899
You.

913
01:37:55,065 --> 01:37:58,942
Stop that act. Turn off the spotlight.
Take down the net.

914
01:37:59,067 --> 01:38:02,028
Quick, quick!
Take it down, take it down!

915
01:38:06,655 --> 01:38:09,781
No net, Tino. But that should be
right down your alley.

916
01:38:09,907 --> 01:38:14,950
When you first came to me there was no
net. That's when I first figured you had it.

917
01:38:15,075 --> 01:38:17,118
Ballet!

918
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,580
Quick. Ballet! Ballet!

919
01:38:24,747 --> 01:38:26,748
<i>Vite.</i>

920
01:38:31,167 --> 01:38:33,417
This is the night we've been working for.

921
01:38:33,584 --> 01:38:36,044
Your night. The biggest night of your life.

922
01:38:36,169 --> 01:38:40,588
- You have to get them down! You must!
- They won't fly without a net.

923
01:38:40,755 --> 01:38:44,799
<i>I guess I had you all wrong.
I guess you're only brave on the ground.</i>

924
01:38:44,924 --> 01:38:49,634
We can go down, or stay up here and see
how much nerve you've really got.

925
01:38:49,759 --> 01:38:53,677
Are you scared, Tino?
Are your hands wet? Are they sweating?

926
01:38:53,844 --> 01:38:58,514
Maybe you're too scared to go down.
Does the height bother you? Is that it?

927
01:38:58,679 --> 01:39:02,140
You said I was the only man in the world
could teach you a triple.

928
01:39:02,265 --> 01:39:06,935
Well, there's nothing more I can give you.
It's up to you now.

929
01:39:09,519 --> 01:39:13,604
Come on, kid. Get up.
Pull yourself together. Give it a try.

930
01:39:13,771 --> 01:39:16,523
Take the rosin.

931
01:39:16,689 --> 01:39:20,565
That's it, that's it.
Get plenty on those wrists.

932
01:39:40,033 --> 01:39:42,952
Make sure you force out
above those connecting wires.

933
01:39:45,702 --> 01:39:51,123
Take a natural set. When you ride
down the hill, break full and strong.

934
01:39:51,289 --> 01:39:53,749
Watch my swing.
Let me know when it's right.

935
01:39:53,874 --> 01:39:56,834
And remember, kid, you can do it.

936
01:41:17,998 --> 01:41:20,498
Mr Ribble, can I get you
to hold it right there?

937
01:41:20,665 --> 01:41:24,501
You boys made the circus circus
for me tonight. Get a picture of 'em.

938
01:41:24,668 --> 01:41:27,210
<i>How about a smile?</i>

939
01:41:27,335 --> 01:41:30,171
- Get some pictures.
- OK.

940
01:41:30,336 --> 01:41:34,548
Can I take one smiling?
Hands up high. How about a smile?

941
01:41:38,758 --> 01:41:42,593
<i>How about a smile?</i>

942
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:44,553
How about it? Make a smile.

943
01:41:44,678 --> 01:41:48,929
I can't get over it, seeing a triple again.
How about it, Mike?

944
01:41:49,096 --> 01:41:50,889
Tino made it easy for me.

945
01:41:51,014 --> 01:41:54,516
How's it feel, boy, throwing your first one?

946
01:41:54,682 --> 01:42:00,810
It feels like you should go on
throwing them, to a great catcher.

947
01:42:00,934 --> 01:42:04,854
When you can fly like Tino,
anybody can catch you.

948
01:42:05,021 --> 01:42:08,606
You fly in my circus, you fly with a net.
No nonsense like tonight.

949
01:42:08,773 --> 01:42:13,524
- Now one of the three hands together.
- That's right. You two. You too, Miss Lola.

950
01:42:13,691 --> 01:42:17,276
Mademoiselle, how do you feel
about going to America?

951
01:42:17,443 --> 01:42:22,696
You're all having dinner with me. And the
way I feel, anything you want, name it.

952
01:42:24,447 --> 01:42:27,531
I just wanna keep the act together.

953
01:42:30,116 --> 01:42:32,242
- That's what I want.
- That's how it'll be.

954
01:42:32,368 --> 01:42:35,244
How about one of the boy
and the girl together?

955
01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:38,204
What's the secret of the triple, Mr Orsini?

956
01:42:38,371 --> 01:42:42,622
Knowing when to come out of that third
somersault. Your timing's gotta be perfect.

957
01:42:42,789 --> 01:42:46,540
It's like a little clock inside of you
that's got the right time.

958
01:42:46,707 --> 01:42:50,960
It's gotta tick alongside your partner's.
You only get a triple when it's the same.

959
01:42:51,126 --> 01:42:54,711
- When did you first know you had it?
- Mike knew before I did.

960
01:42:54,878 --> 01:42:58,380
- I didn't think I was ready, but he did.
- Were you scared?

961
01:42:58,546 --> 01:43:02,423
If not for Mike, I'd have quit.
The first time I did it, I froze.

962
01:43:02,548 --> 01:43:05,175
- But he made me try again.
- And he caught that one?

963
01:43:05,300 --> 01:43:09,636
Not quite. But suddenly I knew when I did
I'd have the world in the palm of my hand.

964
01:43:09,803 --> 01:43:15,347
That's the kind of feeling it gives you.
There's nothing else like it...

965
01:43:31,146 --> 01:43:34,106
When you get to New York, Otto,

966
01:43:34,231 --> 01:43:37,148
don't push him too fast.

967
01:43:37,315 --> 01:43:40,401
Let him feel it out.

968
01:43:40,567 --> 01:43:46,070
And remember he's lofty, so don't
stay back in the hole. Swing up to him.

969
01:43:46,237 --> 01:43:48,904
Don't ever try to snatch him,
cos he'll overturn.

970
01:43:48,988 --> 01:43:51,322
The act is still yours, Mike.

971
01:43:51,489 --> 01:43:53,824
Still Ribble and Orsini.

972
01:43:56,742 --> 01:43:59,284
There's too much between us, Otto.

973
01:44:06,247 --> 01:44:09,123
Keep him breaking full and strong.

974
01:44:10,248 --> 01:44:13,499
Make him drive that break, drive it hard.

975
01:44:15,334 --> 01:44:18,877
Now that he's got it, don't let him lose it.

976
01:45:47,796 --> 01:45:50,631
