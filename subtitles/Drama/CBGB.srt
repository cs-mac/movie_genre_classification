Uh, hello.

158
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,808
We hear you have a stage.

159
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,326
We have a band.

160
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,882
The perfect band
to perform on your stage.

161
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,769
What kind of music do you play?

162
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,161
Uh, new music.

163
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,122
Uh, what does CBGB stand for?

164
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,405
Country, Bluegrass, Blues.

165
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,323
They play a little of that.

166
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:44,008
A little rock, a little country,
a little bluegrass, a little blues.

167
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,324
Hey, didn't you use to manage
the Village Vanguard?

168
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,164
Hundred years ago.

169
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,850

I manage the band Television.

171
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,445
Oh.

172
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,526
Uh, you just met the guitar players,
Richard and Tom, outside.

173
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,564
It's a win-win.

174
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,885
CBGB gets new customers buying drinks,
and we get to play for an audience.

175
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,126
They any good?

176
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,041
They are raw...

177
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,646
and they-they're primitive.

178
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,644
- They are going to be huge.
- I bet they stink.

179
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,007
But maybe if they perform...

180
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,125
they'll get better.

181
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,885
All right.
You've got some vision, man.

182
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,440
- Only original music.
- You got it.

183
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:56,570
Ah! That way, you get to avoid
paying ASCAP fees.

184
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,483
It's a philosophy.

185
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,408

- No.

"The great thing
about this band, Television...

389
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,525
is that they have absolutely
no musical or socially

390
00:29:41,551 --> 00:29:43,996
redeeming characteristics,
and they know it."

391
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,486
- Who wrote that?
- Josh Feigenbaum.

392
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,528
- Who's he?
- He's important.

393
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,127
So, people are gonna read this,
and they're gonna start talking.

394
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,441
And bands are gonna start showing up,
wanting to play here.

395
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,807
And all bands have fans.
Even the shitty ones.

396
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,042
And everybody wants to be in a band
and have fans...

397
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,202
so new bands are gonna start up
and show up.

398
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,770
You have no idea
what's about to happen here.

399
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,526
So, gimme a job.

400
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,967
The pay sucks. The music sucks.

401
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:22,001
But far be it for me
to refute the words of Josh Feigenbaum.

402
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,050
- What do you expect to do around here?
- What do you do around here?

403
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,805
Do you want a job,
or do you want to fight?

404
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,527
I asked you for a job.

405
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,086
Fine.

406
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:50,216
Okay. To start with... bands will
sound check from 4:00 to 6:00.

407
00:30:50,242 --> 00:30:50,874
Yeah.

00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,803
I'll post the lineup at 7:30.

409
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,730
Bands don't get to decide the order.
They fight and they're out.

410
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,003
- Got it. Anything else?
- Yeah. Bikers don't pay for their drinks.

00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,320
When?

412
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,084

01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,329
"The Ramones
are the apotheosis of punk."

949
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,210
Frank Rose again.

950
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,689
"They are an acknowledgment of the
failure of glitter." That they are.

951
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:30,970
"Brevity is the soul of wit, and it is
right at the heart of the Ramones' music.

952
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,004
They could not be accused
of dragging out a number."

953
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,162
We just gotta hope
they don't kill each other.

954
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:41,402
Call Leslie.

955
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:43,924
Number is on the wall.

956
01:05:50,400 --> 01:05:55,486
Hilly Kristal? My understanding is that
there is a problem with the rent.

957
01:05:56,413 --> 01:05:59,186
And when the rent doesn't get
paid, it comes to me to collect.

958
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,562
But you see, I'm forced to double it
to cover my overhead.

959
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,849
So now, we have a compounded problem.

960
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,410
<i>- How many are there?</i>
- Three.

961
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:09,209
<i>- They packing?</i>
- Yeah.

962
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,204
The rent check's on its way,
but I just--

963
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:14,169
if you could think about the doubling.

964
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,480
There's nothing
to think about, Mr. Kristal.

965
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:17,354
You guys thirsty?

966
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,300
Cut the shit. You have a
thriving business that

967
01:06:19,326 --> 01:06:21,225
operates at full capacity
almost every night...

968
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:23,647
so let me explain something to you.

969
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:25,882
I'm not a very patient man.

970
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:28,008
So I suggest you give me
what I came here for.

971
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:41,881
- How you been, Leslie?
- I ain't been feeling too good.

972
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,724
Think I got a tapeworm.

973
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,087
- Mmm.
- Quit calling me that.

974
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,364
- You know who you're dealin' with?
- Get in the fuckin' car.

975
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:54,206
- Don't dent my car.
- Let's go. Let's go!

976
01:07:05,080 --> 01:07:07,560
- What was that?
- A shakedown.

977
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:09,768
New York style.

978
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,808
I don't understand.

979
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,889
You paid the rent, right?

980
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,888
Everything all right?

981
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:21,564
Why wouldn't it be?

982
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,647
I wrote a rent check last week.

983
01:07:25,160 --> 01:07:28,482
<i>- So</i> it was a misunderstanding?
- I didn't send it.

984
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,925
What? Why not?

985
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:35,441
I forgot.

986
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,681
- Dad!
- What?

987
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:39,206
I am taking over the books
whether you like it or not.

988
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,490
Because if I don't, someone is going
to come here and kill you.

989
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,403
- Okay.
- Okay?

990
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:47,562
Yeah. Okay.

991
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:01,010
Hello there.

992
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:03,805
Kristal. This your truck?

993
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:05,644
You know it is.

994
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,324
I'm gonna have to write you up.

995
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:08,481
Why?

996
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,050
Did you read the sign?

997
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:16,128
You and I both know...

998
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:21,491
how long this truck has been
parked here-- in this exact spot--

999
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,369
without getting a ticket.

1000
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,408
New York is going bankrupt.

1001
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,655
There's pressure to
bring in some revenue.

1002
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:28,236
Well--

1003
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:34,001
This car has been here all day.

1004
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,645
Move the truck.

1005
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,285
City's cracking down.

1006
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,770
- You're not telling me the whole story.
- What's that supposed to mean?

1007
01:09:08,120 --> 01:09:10,202
Where does the cash go
at the end of the night?

1008
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:13,450
After I count it?

1009
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:14,726
- Stop it.
- What?

1010
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:17,770
What happens to the cash
at the end of the night?

1011
01:09:18,360 --> 01:09:20,362
I put it in the freezer.

1012
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:21,851
What?

1013
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,206
- In my apartment.
- You got an apartment?

1014
01:09:25,280 --> 01:09:30,002
I can't sleep on a mattress when bands
are getting signed right and left.

1015
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,481
I'm going to go through
all this paper...

1016
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:34,244
and then we will know where we're at.

1017
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:34,962
Terrific.

1018
01:09:34,988 --> 01:09:37,554
You go to the freezer
in your apartment...

1019
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,170
and get the money, now.

1020
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:43,484
Pay the rent, now,
and take the rest to the bank, now.

1021
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:45,881
I don't know how this is gonna work out
with you ordering me around.

1022
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,446
I don't know how it's gonna work out
if I don't.

the front room here.

The Dead Boys. Talking Heads.
The Shirts.

1045
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:41,001
Punk isn't about decay. It's about
the apocalypse. it's about annihilation.

1046
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,651
Nothing works, so let's skip
right to Armageddon.

If the world is ending, you might as well do
away with pretense and say what you think.

1048

Just everything.

1052

Decadence sounds great right now...

1053

- Mother.

1070
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,402

- Welcome to CBGB's.

1071
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:13,845
Hillel.

1072
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,205
Listen. I need a drink.

1073
01:13:17,280 --> 01:13:19,282
On the house.

1074
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,681
Glenlivet with a twist.

1075
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,290
- Coming right up.
- Okay.

1076
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,683
- We don't have any Glenlivet.
- We'll take care of it. Go talk to Lisa.

1077
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:31,082
Come this way. Mrs. Kristal, I have
a special spot for you right up here.

1078
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,685
Excuse me. Watch your backs.

1079
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:38,969
This is what you're spending.
This is what you're making.

1080
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:41,964
- I have to get back out there.
- Give her a minute, Hilly.

1081
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:45,730
You're spending too much.

1082
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,406
You cannot afford
to personally take on a band.

1083
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,729
- I agree with Lisa on this.
- Uh--

1084
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,125
This is about the Dead Boys.

1085
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:56,443
Yeah. Before we branch out, we need
to get our primary business in order.

1086
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:59,171
We need to put
proper vendor agreements in place.

1087
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:00,765
We need to have billing cycles.

1088
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,201
Look here. Okay?

1089
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,275
This is what you're
spending on toilet paper.

1090
01:14:06,301 --> 01:14:07,993
I don't believe that.

1091
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,895
You're getting it from the deli.
A lot of it.

1092
01:14:09,921 --> 01:14:12,508
If you buy it in bulk, you can get
it for a fraction of the price.

1093
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,443
This is what you're spending on beer.

1094
01:14:15,440 --> 01:14:18,330
This is what you are bringing in
on the bar in general.

1095
01:14:18,440 --> 01:14:20,681
Too many customers are
drinking for free.

1096
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,250
- This is bullshit.
- Hilly, cut it out.

1097
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,191
What are we talking
about toilet paper?

1098
01:14:24,217 --> 01:14:27,306
I have Genya Ravan out there, ready
to produce the Dead Boys album.

1099
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:29,442
You're wasting my time.

1100
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:31,682
- Fine.
- Goddamn it, Hilly.

1101
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:36,884
This is quite good.

1102
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:41,771
- Hilly's chili, huh?

What are you doin'?

1108
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,884
Trying to light a cigarette.

1109

You shouldn't smoke.

1110

01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,169
You have no vision, Merv.

1262
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,083
- Well, I quit!
- I'll call you later.

1263
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:31,764
- I won't answer.
- Oh, yes, you will.

1264
01:25:31,840 --> 01:25:33,365
No, I won't.

1265
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,610
Went to a pawn shop.

1266
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:03,691
Sold everything.

1267
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,210
My father's watch.

1268
01:26:08,280 --> 01:26:10,203
Hey, you asshole!

1269
01:26:13,480 --> 01:26:15,130
They destroyed your truck.

1270
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,481
And their equipment.
They're gonna need equipment.

1271
01:26:24,320 --> 01:26:25,242
Oh, yeah.

1272
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,049
- Why are you doing this?
- I believe in them.

1273
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,884
Hey.

1274
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:34,046
Hey.

1275
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:37,044
Thank you.

1276
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,771
Why are you thanking me?

1277
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,046
Somebody should.

1278
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,322
It's not the end of the world.

1279
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:54,445
I mean, this could be good for us,
if we manage it right.

1280
01:26:54,520 --> 01:26:56,329
We are punks, after all.

1281
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:58,766
Blitz might be dead.

1282
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,490
The last thing I care about
is publicity...

1283
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:03,928
for a band who's about
to cost me my club.

1284
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:13,769
How is he?

1285
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:16,565
He's, um, critical.

1286
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,483
Fuck.

1287
01:27:25,000 --> 01:27:27,048
Do you still have the money?

1288
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,281
Yeah.

1289
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:35,646
Blitz is gonna need it.
Make sure he gets good medical care.

1290
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:38,485
- Where you going?
- I'm not your father.

1291
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,970
I'm just your manager.

1292
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:46,686
I can't do this anymore.

No. No way.
I won't let you.

I can't even pay the rent.

Yeah, you can.

And, yes, you will.

a lousy businessman, Dad...

1336

but, damn it, you are the father

and OM FUG, whatever the hell that is.

And it's not all about you.

1339
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:55,844
Okay, there are kids out there
in bands or forming bands...

1340
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:58,366
hoping to play at CBGB one day.

1341
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:02,961
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
right now, and get over here.

1342
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:06,123
Lisa, stop shouting and feed Jonathan.

1343
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:09,010
CBGB.

- No. I don't have the lineup for tonight.

<i>All right.</i>

1346
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:18,764
CBGB.

1347
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,207
- Hey, Hilly.
- Hilly.

1348
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:35,085
I just don't get it.

1349
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:39,728
Why did you risk everything
on the Dead Boys?

1350
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:44,202
Was it the auto-asphyxiation
or the self-mutilation?

1351
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:48,526
- They could have been a bellwether.
- That's debatable.

1352
01:31:53,640 --> 01:31:55,563
I'm going to law school.

1353
01:31:56,720 --> 01:31:57,721
Really?

1354
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,644
- How come?
- 'Cause I know you're gonna need me to.

1355
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:06,004
Even though I know
you'll never admit it.

1356
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,845
Your friends have been waiting
out there for you all fuckin' day.

1357
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,765
Get your ass out there.

1358
01:32:13,840 --> 01:32:18,164
You know, I really don't appreciate
all the swearing.

1359
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,409
I know you all counted on me...

1360
01:32:34,480 --> 01:32:36,289
but the thing is, I'm broke...

1361
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,091
and I think we're gonna have
to close the club.

1362
01:32:39,160 --> 01:32:41,208
Oh, God!

1363
01:32:42,520 --> 01:32:44,727
How many years
have we listened to your shit?

1364
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:48,531
Lisa and I made a few calls.

1365
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,282
A lot of calls.

1366
01:32:52,360 --> 01:32:53,885
And people wanted to help.

1367
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:57,806
Yeah, like people that you helped,
even when you didn't have money.

1368
01:32:58,880 --> 01:32:59,881
But, uh--

1369
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:03,728
Lisa's gonna take care of this.

1370
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,122
She's gonna pay the bills.
She's gonna get the place back on track.

1371
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,721
Want you to have this.
It's all I got.

1372
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,481
I have a-- Don't tell anybody.

1373
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:22,803
I have a gold filling
in my tooth in the back.

1374
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,644
You could probably
take it off like this.

1375
01:33:24,720 --> 01:33:26,404
Thanks, Idaho.

1376
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:33,240
Looks like I'm not gonna need
either of those.

1377
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:48,802
Okay.

1378
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:50,609
When you're ready.

1379
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:56,051
Thank you, sir.
It's an honor to be here.

1380
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:00,800

Talking Heads,
get the hell up here, please.

1436
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,406
We wanna start where we can
by thanking Hilly Kristal.

1437
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:09,925
We'd like to invite Hilly up here.

1438
01:38:10,000 --> 01:38:14,403
Hilly is the reason that we're here,
that the Ramones are here...

1439
01:38:14,480 --> 01:38:16,403
that Blondie are here.

1440
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:18,323
He kept us alive.

1441
01:38:19,760 --> 01:38:24,766
He fed us and he supported us
in every way possible.

1442
01:38:24,840 --> 01:38:28,686
He told us we needed
to expand our sound...

1443
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:32,003
and he taught us a lot about ethics...

1444
01:38:32,080 --> 01:38:33,844
about how to treat people.

1445
01:38:33,920 --> 01:38:35,649
I'd like to thank Hilly again.

1446
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:38,166
When we were starting out,
there really weren't clubs...

1447
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,210
where bands could play
their own material...

1448
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:46,127
and poor Hilly wanted to have
a bluegrass bar on the Bowery...

1449
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:48,049
and to have some other music as well.

1450
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,444
I guess the road didn't go that way.

1451
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:53,761
The road took another turn...

1452
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:56,491
and, uh, thanks to--

1453
01:38:58,200 --> 01:39:01,249
We're thanking him 'cause he went
that direction and didn't mind.

1454
01:39:01,920 --> 01:39:04,161
It was just extraordinary,
the fact that...

1455
01:39:04,240 --> 01:39:06,163
bands came out of the woodwork.

1456
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:08,641
They were everywhere.
They were coming from out of state.

1457
01:39:08,760 --> 01:39:10,489
Nobody knew they were there.

1458
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,688
They came out because
there was somewhere to play.

1459
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:15,889
Hilly brought the music into existence
in many ways.
