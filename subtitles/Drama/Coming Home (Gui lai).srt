1
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,222
All right.
That's it for today. Everyone listen up.

2
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:20,058
Gather around.

3
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,726
You all did very well today.

4
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,563
Next month we will find out
the company's decisions on the major roles.

5
00:02:25,647 --> 00:02:26,981
Everyone should do her very best.

6
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:30,068
Dandan.
Please go to the Propaganda Office.

7
00:02:40,453 --> 00:02:41,454
Dandan.

8
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:42,789
Mother.

9
00:02:42,872 --> 00:02:44,916
Close the door. Sit down.

10
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:58,846
Dandan.

11
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,140
I had your mother come in today

12
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:03,976
because I have something to tell you both.

13
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,605
- Something happened to Lu.
- Is he in trouble?

14
00:03:09,232 --> 00:03:10,483
What happened?

15
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:15,113
He escaped.

16
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:17,448
Escaped?

17
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,034
How?

18
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,453
That Rightist is a sneaky bastard.

19
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:27,041
He ran off during a prison transfer
at a train station not far from here.

20
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,261
Have you been in contact with him?

21
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:40,847
No.

22
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:44,434
I haven't heard from him in 10 years.

23
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:51,274
I must inform you that firstly

24
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:55,403
if you know his whereabouts,
report it immediately

25
00:03:55,862 --> 00:03:57,655
and help the authorities apprehend him.

26
00:03:58,156 --> 00:03:59,115
Secondly,

27
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,075
it is strictly forbidden to meet him.

28
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,161
He is the enemy.
Don't cross the line.

29
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:07,206
Have I made myself clear?

30
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:10,267
Now declare your position.

31
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:13,504
I have nothing to do with him.
I will obey the Party's decisions.

32
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,217
Teacher Yu.

33
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:22,346
Your daughter's doing well.
How about you?

34
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:29,020
Teacher Yu.

35
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:32,482
Let me be absolutely clear.

36
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,861
Withholding information
is a very serious crime.

37
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,363
I'm doing this for your own good.

38
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,783
Think about your daughter's future.

39
00:04:43,367 --> 00:04:45,870
Do you understand what I'm saying?

40
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:49,540
Mother.

41
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,297
I understand.

42
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,103
Mother.

43
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,980
Will they let me be the lead?

44
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,191
Ah.

45
00:05:58,067 --> 00:05:59,652
The soldier is a good role, too.

46
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:02,822
I don't want to play a soldier.
I'll be the lead or nothing.

47
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,632
Mother.

48
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:24,886
You mustn't see him.
He's an enemy of the party.

49
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,575
Mother.

50
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:49,410
Get the door.

51
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:57,043
- Deputy Li.
- Deputy Li.

52
00:06:57,877 --> 00:06:59,045
Come in.

53
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,557
Teacher Yu of Guangming Middle School.

54
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,102
Her daughter Dandan,
a student at the dance academy.

55
00:07:15,186 --> 00:07:18,481
This is Deng and his colleague,
Comrade Liu from the political prison.

56
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,024
They have some questions for you.

57
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:39,835
Whoa.

58
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,049
Lu escaped.
Did you know that?

59
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,302
Yes.

60
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:53,099
Please tell me, why did he do it?

61
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,770
- What did you do to him?
- Who's asking the questions here?

62
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,857
She just wants to know.

63
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:04,986
It's been so long since she heard from him.
It's only human.

64
00:08:05,069 --> 00:08:07,488
Deputy Li, with all due respect...

65
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,490
Try not to forget which side you're on.

66
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,492
Fine, I'll be quiet. Please continue.

67
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:14,662
Certain things
the family does not need to know.

68
00:08:16,455 --> 00:08:19,917
Just answer our questions. Okay?

69
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:41,605
It's so obvious.
Dandan is the better dancer.

70
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,233
That's not the point.

71
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,485
Her father committed a crime and ran off.

72
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:49,321
Talk to her after the rehearsal.

73
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:53,367
She was only three
when her father was taken away.

74
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:56,871
- She hardly knows him.
- That's irrelevant.

75
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,749
Mei will take the lead. And that's final.

76
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,116
Ah!

77
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,002
Who's there?

78
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,028
Lu.

79
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,581
Did you see my mother?

80
00:14:33,582 --> 00:14:34,583
Dandan?

81
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:47,596
You're a big girl now.

82
00:14:51,475 --> 00:14:52,643
I'm your father.

83
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,853
I don't know you.

84
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:00,359
I just want to see you and your mother.

85
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:02,361
Nobody wants to see you.

86
00:15:09,243 --> 00:15:11,912
Tell your mother tomorrow morning at 8:00.

87
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,039
I'll be waiting for her at the station.

88
00:15:14,665 --> 00:15:15,666
No way.

89
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,418
Did something happen?

90
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,462
I didn't get the lead.

91
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,592
Wu <i>Qinghua in
The Red Detachment of Women.</i>

92
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:15,679
Why not?

93
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:35,490
What is there to think about?
It's for a righteous cause.

94
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:37,117
You will be justly rewarded.

95
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,746
Give me good information
and I can talk to your school.

96
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:42,456
You can have any role you want.

97
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,083
Eh?

98
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,669
Where's your school? I'll write it down.

99
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,018
Mother, I'm home.

100
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,316
- What took you so long?
- Late rehearsal.

101
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,587
Mother. Are you going to meet him?

102
00:19:36,426 --> 00:19:38,970
What about me?
Did you think about me?

103
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,181
Since you were young,
I've always put you first.

104
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:43,767
But this time I must think of your father.

105
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:54,861
I don't care. I won't let you go!

106
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:56,697
Dandan.

107
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,116
What I do is none of your business.

108
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,868
Your business is to dance Wu Qinghua.

109
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,454
You'll ruin everything!

110
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,626
I'm not letting you go!

111
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,644
Yu!

112
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:57,520
Yu!

113
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,817
Yu!

114
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,279
Yu!

115
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:09,324
Yu!

116
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:17,916
Move!

117
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:19,542
Over there!

118
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,587
Lu, run!

119
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,132
- Run!
- Yu!

120
00:24:26,216 --> 00:24:28,218
Lu,run!

121
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,557
Run!

122
00:24:38,395 --> 00:24:39,729
Just run!

123
00:24:40,814 --> 00:24:41,982
Run!

124
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,358
Lu,run!

125
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,243
Yu!

126
00:24:58,081 --> 00:24:59,457
Lu!

127
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,750
Mother!

128
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,755
Get out of the way!

129
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:10,635
Lu!

130
00:25:12,262 --> 00:25:13,263
Lu!

131
00:25:13,346 --> 00:25:15,390
Get out of the way! Stop her!

132
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:21,062
Yu!

133
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:22,939
Lu!

134
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:27,068
- Stop!
- Lu!

135
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:32,532
Mother!

136
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,868
- Stop!
- Lu!

137
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,870
Yu!

138
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,039
Lu!

139
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,311
Lu!

140
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:03,730
Mother!

141
00:26:04,773 --> 00:26:05,774
Mother!

142
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:07,525
Yu!

143
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:21,623
Mother!

144
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:25,376
Mother!

145
00:26:35,053 --> 00:26:38,098
"THE RED DETACHMENT OF WOMEN"

00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:18,675
Dandan?

152
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,348
Mother didn't come.

153
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,392
But I wrote to her.

154
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:29,227
I don't know what happened.

155
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,895
Deputy Li told me.

156
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,733
- So, your mother...
- I didn't tell her.

157
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,279
Is this all your luggage?

158
00:29:39,362 --> 00:29:41,656
No, I shipped some.

159
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,033
Let's go.

160
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,583
What is this place?

161
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:55,920
This is where I work,
a textile factory dormitory.

162
00:29:58,881 --> 00:30:01,884
- You're not dancing anymore?
- I gave that up long ago.

163
00:30:04,721 --> 00:30:05,722
Hello.

164
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,606
Come in.

165
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:22,405
That's my bed, sit down.

166
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,533
Dandan.

167
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,243
I'm not staying.

168
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,412
I'd rather head straight home.

169
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:33,333
- I have something to tell you.
- What is it?

170
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:38,671
- Is it urgent?
<i>- I'll</i> tell you when I get off work.

171
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,257
I only took three hours' leave.
I should get back.

172
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:43,009
Okay.

173
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:46,471
I'll go home.
We can talk there later.

174
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:29,722
TURN OFF THE LIGHTS WHEN YOU LEAVE.

175
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:43,277
DON'T LOCK THE DOOR.

176
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,639
TOMORROW MORNING I WILL WAIT
FOR YOU AT THE TRAIN STATION.

177
00:32:23,568 --> 00:32:27,196
TURN OFF THE LIGHT.

178
00:32:41,461 --> 00:32:42,670
Teacher Yu.

179
00:32:42,753 --> 00:32:44,255
Grocery shopping?

180
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,500
You're here.

181
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:23,461
Yu.

182
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:26,047
I'm home.

183
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,764
Is this your stuff?

184
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,516
Yes, my luggage-

185
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:41,312
Sit.

186
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,105
Please, sit down.

187
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:44,815
Please.

188
00:33:57,787 --> 00:33:58,955
Yu.

189
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,709
- How have you been?
- I'm well.

190
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:17,306
You must be tired.
Let me get you some water.

191
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,306
How's everything at home?

192
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,851
Everything's fine.

193
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:06,188
Dandan picked me up at the station.

194
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:08,858
Yes, Dandan picked you up.

195
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,988
Dandan dances...

196
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:16,574
Dances ballet.

197
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,409
It's tiring. Lots of practice.

198
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:26,500
Did something happen here?

199
00:35:28,586 --> 00:35:30,254
No, nothing.

200
00:35:31,047 --> 00:35:34,216
- What about you?
- I'm fine. Everything's fine.

201
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:48,814
Have you eaten?

202
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,024
Huh?

203
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:53,486
Stay for supper.
I'll go buy something.

204
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,613
I'll get some food.
Stay for supper.

205
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:58,699
Sit.

206
00:36:55,798 --> 00:36:57,717
Mr. Fang,

207
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,552
what are you doing here?

208
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,975
What did you call me? Fang?

209
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,728
Please leave.

210
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,855
What's going on?

211
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,315
Get out.

212
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:15,359
It's me.

213
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:19,363
'Who?
- Lu!

214
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:23,367
What are you talking about?
Leave! Get out!

215
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:25,369
What's wrong with you?

216
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,455
Get out!

217
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,749
Get out!

218
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:38,966
Get out!

219
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:50,436
Get out!

220
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:54,064
Get out!

221
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:17,129
Dandan.

222
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:20,591
Your mother didn't recognize me.

223
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:24,303
Dandan. Come in.

224
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,972
We've been waiting for you.

225
00:38:27,056 --> 00:38:28,891
Yu, I brought Dandan.

226
00:38:30,226 --> 00:38:31,310
Mother.

227
00:38:31,393 --> 00:38:32,770
What are you doing here?

228
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:37,942
Greet your father.
Greet your father for your mother.

229
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,860
So that she knows he's your father.

230
00:38:39,944 --> 00:38:42,780
Go on, Dandan, greet your father.

231
00:38:42,863 --> 00:38:44,657
What can she prove?

232
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,409
Ask her.
Did she acknowledge him before?

233
00:38:49,245 --> 00:38:50,996
I don't want to see her.

234
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,417
It's pointless if you won't greet your father.

235
00:38:57,169 --> 00:38:59,004
Yu, I'll tell you one last time.

236
00:39:00,339 --> 00:39:01,841
Times have changed.

237
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:03,342
Lu has been rehabilitated.

238
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:04,969
We've received notification.

239
00:39:06,345 --> 00:39:08,347
Official letters are normally classified.

240
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,765
There's an official letter?

241
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,698
NOTICE OF REHABILITATION

242
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,421
Lu.

243
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,689
He's alive and he's coming home.

244
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:08,407
I'll meet him at the train station tomorrow.

245
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:11,619
You don't have to. He's right here.

246
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:22,338
No, that's not him.

247
00:40:29,595 --> 00:40:31,555
Comrade Yu.

248
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,098
Do you trust the Party?

249
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:34,975
Yes, I do.

250
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:37,144
Am I the Party representative?

251
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,398
Then shouldn't you trust me?

252
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:42,900
Yes, I should.

253
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,109
Good.

254
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,613
Come in.

255
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:55,079
In the name of the Party, I assure you...

256
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,914
This man right here

257
00:40:57,623 --> 00:40:59,625
is your husband Comrade Lu.

258
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:04,463
Yu.

259
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:08,717
I know who he is.

260
00:41:09,218 --> 00:41:10,636
He's Fang.

261
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:12,554
Mr. Fang.

262
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:16,266
I don't want him in my home.

263
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,268
You should ask him to leave.

264
00:41:18,936 --> 00:41:20,562
I don't want him here.

265
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,399
Make him go away.

266
00:41:23,857 --> 00:41:27,319
That's how she is now.
Some days are worse than others.

267
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:30,406
She looks all right. It's her mind.

268
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,785
If Teacher Yu doesn't want you here,
we can't risk upsetting her.

269
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:37,413
We'll find a place for you to stay.

270
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:39,331
Xu.

271
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,709
Is the store next to the kiosk still empty?

272
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:43,585
- Yes.
- You can stay there for now.

273
00:41:43,669 --> 00:41:45,295
I thank the Party.

274
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,756
Also, you can go back to work now.

275
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,299
Do you want your job back?

276
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:56,140
Given her condition, I'll wait.

277
00:41:56,932 --> 00:41:58,600
Okay, one step at a time.

278
00:41:58,684 --> 00:41:59,852
Deputy...

279
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:01,520
Who is this Fang?

280
00:42:01,603 --> 00:42:05,524
He was a Party official.
Yu had been asking him to help you.

281
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:08,652
Could we bring him over
to help her remember?

282
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:10,112
That's not going to help.

283
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,532
He was transferred to the suburbs

284
00:42:13,615 --> 00:42:15,492
and we lost contact.

285
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,288
I'll get the door.

286
00:42:27,504 --> 00:42:29,131
It's not much.

287
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,884
Xu. Let's tidy it up a bit.

288
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,719
Okay, I'll find someone.

289
00:42:34,845 --> 00:42:36,847
- It's just temporary.
- I'm okay.

290
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:38,724
It has its benefits.

291
00:42:38,807 --> 00:42:40,476
It's close to Yu's place,

292
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,352
just across the street.

293
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,937
I'll tell you something.

294
00:42:44,021 --> 00:42:47,232
- Yu doesn't lock her door.
- Why not?

295
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:51,570
Ever since that night you couldn't get in
she stopped looking the door.

296
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:55,282
She's always saying,
"I must never lock Lu out again."

297
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:04,166
How did your mother
end up like this?

298
00:43:07,878 --> 00:43:11,799
- Has she seen a doctor?
- Yes, he said it's psychogenic amnesia.

299
00:43:12,382 --> 00:43:15,385
- Psychogenic amnesia?
- Yes, psychogenic amnesia.

300
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,181
- How long has it been?
- Over a year now.

301
00:43:22,059 --> 00:43:23,811
Can she manage day to day?

302
00:43:24,812 --> 00:43:25,813
Yes.

303
00:43:26,939 --> 00:43:29,566
- She doesn't get lost?
- No.

304
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:34,279
Dandan.
Do you always stay at your dorm?

305
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:37,241
I visit her mornings and evenings.

306
00:43:37,783 --> 00:43:41,120
Your mother's not well.
Why don't you live with her?

307
00:43:41,995 --> 00:43:44,540
- She won't let me.
- Why not?

308
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,836
I need to get going.

309
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:36,758
- Good morning, Teacher Yu.
- Ah.

310
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:51,523
Yu?

311
00:44:51,899 --> 00:44:52,900
Ah.

312
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:33,565
- Wait in line...

313
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:35,442
...don't push, one at a time!

314
00:45:35,734 --> 00:45:37,903
Get your tickets, don't push!

315
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:39,655
Mind your belongings!

316
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,778
Your food!

317
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,470
- Comrade, is this the train from Xining?
- Yes.

318
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:40,359
Comrade.
Are there any more passengers?

319
00:47:40,442 --> 00:47:41,443
No.

320
00:48:11,807 --> 00:48:13,183
Hi, Lu.

321
00:48:13,642 --> 00:48:15,894
A letter for Yu.
You can give it to her.

322
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,314
Thank you.

323
00:48:45,006 --> 00:48:46,049
Come in.

324
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,428
- Dandan.
- What's so urgent?

325
00:48:49,511 --> 00:48:51,972
The letter I wrote to your mother
has just arrived.

326
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,015
Hurry and take it to her.

327
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:59,104
- It's already out-of-date.
- That's okay.

328
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:03,692
I only wrote that I'd arrive
on the 5th of the month.

329
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:06,111
I didn't specify which month.

330
00:49:06,194 --> 00:49:08,697
I think, once she reads it,

331
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,657
she'll want to meet me at the station.

332
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:16,997
We must hurry.
Today is already the 4th.

333
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:19,875
What's your plan?

334
00:49:36,224 --> 00:49:37,267
Mother.

335
00:49:37,893 --> 00:49:39,060
Dandan.

336
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:40,979
What are you doing here?

337
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,397
A letter from Father.

338
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,941
Your father wrote me?

339
00:51:12,571 --> 00:51:17,492
LU

340
00:53:00,595 --> 00:53:03,515
How did she get this disease?

341
00:53:04,015 --> 00:53:06,976
Right now its causes
are still relatively unknown.

342
00:53:07,686 --> 00:53:09,270
Physical injury,

343
00:53:09,354 --> 00:53:12,273
psychological trauma, malnutrition
can all be factors.

344
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:15,985
She recognizes other people, why is that?

345
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,492
- How long since you've seen each other?
-20 years.

346
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:25,787
- Has your appearance changed a lot?
- I suppose so.

347
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:27,872
That could be it.

348
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:34,754
Dr. Wang. Can she be cured?

349
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,841
There's not much we can do right now.

350
00:53:39,509 --> 00:53:43,555
An article in a foreign journal mentioned
hypnotism, subliminal suggestion

351
00:53:43,638 --> 00:53:45,890
and other psychological treatments.

352
00:53:45,974 --> 00:53:47,517
But we don't have them in China.

353
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,811
- Maybe you can experiment yourself.
- How?

354
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:54,774
An English article I read
talked about a "Déja vu" effect.

355
00:53:54,858 --> 00:53:56,067
Déjà vu

356
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,905
It means "already seen," right?

357
00:54:00,989 --> 00:54:03,908
Yes. That is correct.

358
00:54:05,493 --> 00:54:08,413
-It's French, isn't it?
- Yes.

359
00:54:10,123 --> 00:54:12,584
- You speak French?
- Yes, a little.

360
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,337
The "Déjà vu" theory suggests that,

361
00:54:17,213 --> 00:54:19,215
through imagination,

362
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:21,885
the human brain can create
fictional memories.

363
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:24,345
When encountering
similar moments in real life,

364
00:54:24,429 --> 00:54:27,640
the patient can subconsciously
activate the fictional memories

365
00:54:27,724 --> 00:54:29,684
and make them seem real.

366
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:31,478
For example?

367
00:54:31,728 --> 00:54:32,729
For example...

368
00:54:33,313 --> 00:54:35,148
Places you have lived,

369
00:54:35,231 --> 00:54:37,108
familiar locations,

370
00:54:37,192 --> 00:54:39,944
movies you have seen,
music you have listened to,

371
00:54:40,028 --> 00:54:41,070
letters,

372
00:54:41,154 --> 00:54:43,198
books, old photos...

373
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:45,784
They may all be helpful.

374
00:54:56,878 --> 00:54:59,047
There they are.

375
00:55:00,632 --> 00:55:02,592
Come, put them here.

376
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:48,972
That's it. That's everything.

377
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:02,277
Who did all this?

378
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,195
It was me.

379
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:32,765
I heard she doesn't even recognize you.

380
00:56:32,849 --> 00:56:35,476
Seems she's not getting any better.

381
00:56:38,313 --> 00:56:39,314
Zhen.

382
00:56:41,149 --> 00:56:45,570
Do you have any photographs
from when we were young

383
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:47,030
with me in them?

384
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:48,781
I think so.

385
00:56:48,865 --> 00:56:50,366
Wait here. I'll look.

386
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:52,452
Thank you so much.

387
00:57:06,549 --> 00:57:07,550
Ah.

388
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:11,429
It wasn't easy to hold onto
this photo for so many years.

389
00:57:11,512 --> 00:57:15,642
- I'll return it soon.
- No, you should keep it.

390
00:57:16,017 --> 00:57:17,518
How is Wei?

391
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:20,355
He committed suicide.

392
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,696
Dandan.

393
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:29,989
Remember,

394
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:33,409
tell her it was you who kept this photo.

395
00:57:38,331 --> 00:57:40,416
Go. I'll wait here.

396
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:48,800
Who is it?

397
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:51,052
Mother.

398
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:53,721
What is it?

399
00:57:54,138 --> 00:57:56,724
I have a photograph of Father.

400
00:58:00,228 --> 00:58:01,479
A photograph of your father?

401
00:58:06,859 --> 00:58:08,319
You kept it?

402
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,530
So you do have a heart.

403
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:25,128
You never really saw him.
Come here.

404
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,179
This...

405
00:58:35,555 --> 00:58:37,473
This is me.

406
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:40,018
Who is this?

407
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,394
This is Wei.

408
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:43,271
Wei.

409
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:49,485
And this is Zhen, your old classmate.

410
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:55,074
Mother. Who's this?

411
00:58:57,076 --> 00:58:58,703
This is...

412
00:59:02,331 --> 00:59:04,000
This is Lu.

413
00:59:09,797 --> 00:59:11,924
Your father.

414
00:59:13,885 --> 00:59:15,511
This is your father.

415
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:27,440
Look, it's your father.
Take a good look.

416
00:59:29,817 --> 00:59:31,944
Mother, you were so pretty.

417
00:59:34,322 --> 00:59:36,324
Father was dashing, too.

418
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,537
He's coming back.
He's coming home.

419
00:59:41,621 --> 00:59:45,500
- He's already back.
- The 5th... He comes back on the 5th.

420
00:59:49,462 --> 00:59:51,589
Mother. Who is this?

421
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:16,405
Yu.

422
01:00:28,668 --> 01:00:30,086
Yu.

423
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:35,591
He looks familiar...

424
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,682
- Who is he?
- Lu.

425
01:00:44,016 --> 01:00:45,226
Lu.

426
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,603
What kind of nonsense is this?

427
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:48,688
Dandan.

428
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,732
Don't ever bring a stranger
into my home again.

429
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:52,942
Do you hear me?

430
01:01:00,658 --> 01:01:02,326
You can't have this photo.

431
01:01:03,161 --> 01:01:05,246
I can't have you
cutting your father out again.

432
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,622
You and your scissors.

433
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:11,169
Dandan. I'm telling you,

434
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:13,629
the things that you did,

435
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:15,339
I'll never forgive you.

436
01:01:15,423 --> 01:01:16,549
Never.

437
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:21,470
Now go. Go. Just go.

438
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,604
Did you see that?

439
01:01:29,687 --> 01:01:32,190
She gets mad at me over every little thing.

440
01:01:38,029 --> 01:01:39,030
Dandan.

441
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:42,575
Your mother is not well.
You have to be more understanding.

442
01:01:47,246 --> 01:01:48,706
I just don't get it.

443
01:01:48,789 --> 01:01:52,293
She forgets everything,
but remembers all my faults.

444
01:04:38,334 --> 01:04:40,795
I don't remember the make.

445
01:04:41,462 --> 01:04:42,963
I've forgotten.

446
01:04:44,423 --> 01:04:46,342
It hasn't been played for a while.

447
01:04:47,301 --> 01:04:50,304
I'd like someone to tune it.

448
01:04:52,473 --> 01:04:55,893
There's no one?
When can he come over?

449
01:04:57,228 --> 01:04:58,896
It's quite urgent.

450
01:04:58,979 --> 01:05:00,898
My husband is coming home soon

451
01:05:00,981 --> 01:05:02,691
and he loves to play the piano.

452
01:05:02,817 --> 01:05:04,860
PIANO TUNING HANDBOOK

453
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:30,553
Comrade, who are you looking for?

454
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:34,515
Is this Teacher Yu's residence?

455
01:05:34,890 --> 01:05:36,267
Yes.

456
01:05:36,934 --> 01:05:38,394
I'm the piano tuner.

457
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:42,106
Piano tuner?

458
01:05:42,606 --> 01:05:45,443
Didn't you call for a piano tuner?

459
01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:50,406
Oh, yes, I did. Come in.

460
01:05:50,906 --> 01:05:52,575
Please come in.

461
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:56,704
This is the piano.

462
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:08,507
It's pretty old.

463
01:06:09,008 --> 01:06:10,009
Hmm.

464
01:06:17,892 --> 01:06:19,977
Hasn't been used for some time.

465
01:06:20,686 --> 01:06:22,688
Yes, a very long time.

466
01:06:26,025 --> 01:06:28,319
Comrade, can you tune it?

467
01:06:29,028 --> 01:06:30,946
No problem.

468
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:01,602
Aren't you feeling well?

469
01:07:02,269 --> 01:07:03,270
Oh. Ah.

470
01:07:11,529 --> 01:07:13,155
Is there anyone to take care of you?

471
01:07:17,368 --> 01:07:19,995
- Do you have children?
- Yes.

472
01:07:21,789 --> 01:07:23,958
She's a ballerina.

473
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,752
- She takes care of you?
- She's busy rehearsing.

474
01:07:27,545 --> 01:07:29,255
She doesn't have time.

475
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:33,592
Can you get by on your own?

476
01:07:34,218 --> 01:07:35,886
Yes, I'm used to it.

477
01:07:48,566 --> 01:07:50,818
Who plays this piano?

478
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,070
My husband.

479
01:07:57,616 --> 01:07:59,076
What does he do?

480
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:00,828
He's a professor.

481
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:05,708
He was sent to the Northwest.
But he's coming back soon.

482
01:08:10,254 --> 01:08:11,964
Teacher Yu...

483
01:08:12,047 --> 01:08:14,091
I heard those people have already returned.

484
01:08:16,176 --> 01:08:17,761
They already came back.

485
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:21,599
No, on the 5th.

486
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:25,894
My husband wrote and said
he's returning on the 5th.

487
01:08:26,937 --> 01:08:27,938
Oh.

488
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:32,151
PICK UP LU ON THE 5TH.

489
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,757
You two have been apart too long.

490
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:13,885
Mmm.

491
01:15:16,263 --> 01:15:17,431
Well...

492
01:15:19,766 --> 01:15:22,144
I'm worried about your mother.

493
01:15:25,188 --> 01:15:27,190
You should go back and live with her.

494
01:15:28,984 --> 01:15:31,737
You know, since that day
you tried to come home

495
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,865
she can hardly look at me.

496
01:15:35,824 --> 01:15:39,119
Since she got ill,
she won't let me in the door.

497
01:15:39,786 --> 01:15:41,788
She doesn't know I quit dancing,

498
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,833
or where I live.

499
01:15:47,085 --> 01:15:49,171
I'm so sorry about you two.

500
01:15:51,256 --> 01:15:52,883
It's all my fault.

501
01:15:52,966 --> 01:15:56,595
Not at all. I'm the one to blame.

502
01:16:01,099 --> 01:16:03,101
If it wasn't for me,

503
01:16:04,311 --> 01:16:05,937
you two wouldn't be like this.

504
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:10,650
It's all right.

505
01:16:10,734 --> 01:16:13,820
It's all in the past now.

506
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:21,203
You still have to work tomorrow.

507
01:16:21,286 --> 01:16:22,829
Go get some rest.

508
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:34,257
Father.

509
01:16:37,886 --> 01:16:38,887
Hey.

510
01:16:39,304 --> 01:16:42,265
I was the one who reported you.

511
01:16:42,682 --> 01:16:46,019
Yes, I know. Deng told me.

512
01:16:51,149 --> 01:16:54,027
Teacher Yu.
There's a package for you.

513
01:16:57,197 --> 01:16:59,241
Come down and get it.

514
01:17:03,036 --> 01:17:04,454
It's from Lu.

515
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:07,082
Teacher Yu. I'll get going now.

516
01:17:07,165 --> 01:17:08,750
Thank you.

517
01:17:15,298 --> 01:17:16,550
Do you need help?

518
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:19,469
Oh. Sorry to trouble you.

519
01:17:24,391 --> 01:17:26,059
- You first, go ahead.
- Ah.

520
01:17:26,268 --> 01:17:27,310
Uh.

521
01:17:27,394 --> 01:17:29,396
Here we are.

522
01:17:34,025 --> 01:17:35,318
Come in please.

523
01:17:35,402 --> 01:17:36,945
Where should I put it?

524
01:17:37,028 --> 01:17:38,488
Put it here.

525
01:17:38,572 --> 01:17:40,490
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

526
01:17:40,574 --> 01:17:42,742
- I'll get going then.
- Thanks again.

527
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:51,960
- Do you want me to open it?
- Okay.

528
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:55,964
Do you have scissors?

529
01:17:56,548 --> 01:17:58,091
Scissors.

530
01:17:58,508 --> 01:18:00,594
I'll look for them.

531
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,972
Here they are.

532
01:18:04,848 --> 01:18:05,932
Okay.

533
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:12,105
It's okay. Allow me.

534
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,361
Here we go.

535
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:29,456
What are these?

536
01:18:30,373 --> 01:18:31,458
Letters.

537
01:18:33,752 --> 01:18:34,961
That's right.

538
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:37,839
Why are there no envelopes?

539
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:40,383
Looks like they were never sent.

540
01:18:42,677 --> 01:18:45,347
- So many of them!
- They look rather old.

541
01:18:50,477 --> 01:18:52,479
It's hard to read.

542
01:18:53,355 --> 01:18:54,981
Who wrote them?

543
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:03,365
It says "Lu" at the end.

544
01:19:04,658 --> 01:19:06,034
Lu.

545
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:08,745
Lu wrote me all these letters.

546
01:19:17,087 --> 01:19:19,214
Why didn't he use proper paper?

547
01:19:19,673 --> 01:19:24,386
I guess he just wrote on
whatever he could get his hands on.

548
01:19:24,469 --> 01:19:26,096
Things must have been difficult.

549
01:19:26,805 --> 01:19:29,182
Was he losing his eyesight?

550
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:31,810
More likely he wrote them in the dark.

551
01:19:33,019 --> 01:19:35,188
Can you tell me what he wrote?

552
01:19:38,733 --> 01:19:39,734
Oh.

553
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,863
"We went to the Gobi Desert to gather sand.

554
01:19:44,447 --> 01:19:49,160
"We ran into a tornado and saw it
spiraling right up to the sky.

555
01:19:49,619 --> 01:19:51,705
"It was quite spectacular."

556
01:20:08,972 --> 01:20:09,973
Comrade.

557
01:20:10,598 --> 01:20:12,100
Can you help me read them?

558
01:20:12,183 --> 01:20:14,436
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

559
01:20:15,437 --> 01:20:16,604
Okay.

560
01:20:26,072 --> 01:20:27,073
Shall I begin?

561
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:33,330
"Winter is almost over...

562
01:20:33,955 --> 01:20:36,916
"Our strength is restored,

563
01:20:37,459 --> 01:20:40,128
"and our tans have faded.

564
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:44,299
"Yu, spring is in the air.

565
01:20:45,258 --> 01:20:48,345
"The mare was giving birth,

566
01:20:48,428 --> 01:20:51,598
"but having some difficulties.

567
01:20:52,349 --> 01:20:54,309
"We got some rope,

568
01:20:54,392 --> 01:20:57,771
"tied it around the foal's legs
and pulled it out.

569
01:20:58,438 --> 01:21:04,444
"We watched the foal struggle to stand
on the grass, yellow flowers blooming.

570
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:09,616
"We realized spring had arrived."

571
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:23,171
No need to see me out.

572
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:29,052
Remember, we already read these.
Don't mix them up.

573
01:21:30,804 --> 01:21:31,846
Good-bye.

574
01:21:34,682 --> 01:21:36,017
Comrade.

575
01:21:36,893 --> 01:21:39,813
- Will you come back?
- To read more letters?

576
01:21:41,523 --> 01:21:42,524
How about tomorrow?

577
01:21:45,151 --> 01:21:46,152
Great.

578
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:50,990
See you.

579
01:22:14,848 --> 01:22:16,015
Hello, Teacher Yu.

580
01:22:17,934 --> 01:22:20,019
- You are...
- Did you forget?

581
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:22,897
Yesterday you asked me
to come back to read more letters.

582
01:22:24,149 --> 01:22:25,191
Oh.

583
01:22:25,525 --> 01:22:28,611
You are the letter-reading comrade.
Please come in.

584
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:34,284
"I've been dreaming a lot.

585
01:22:34,367 --> 01:22:35,994
"I dreamed of you and Dandan.

586
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:41,124
"She was dancing, like a little fairy.

587
01:22:41,207 --> 01:22:42,876
"It was very beautiful.

588
01:22:43,543 --> 01:22:45,420
"Today is her birthday.

589
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:50,216
"Please send her my birthday wishes.

590
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:53,386
"I am her father,

591
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:56,347
"yet I was never around for her.

592
01:22:56,431 --> 01:22:59,350
"It's the biggest regret of my life.

593
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:06,316
"I still remember

594
01:23:06,399 --> 01:23:08,735
"how you didn't want her
to become a dancer.

595
01:23:08,818 --> 01:23:12,614
"You said only science and technology

596
01:23:12,697 --> 01:23:15,492
"could make a meaningful contribution
to our country."

597
01:23:15,575 --> 01:23:20,246
It's true. Back then I was against it.

598
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:23,500
And now? Does she still dance?

599
01:23:23,917 --> 01:23:26,336
Yes, she does.

600
01:23:26,794 --> 01:23:29,506
Later on I became very supportive.

601
01:23:29,589 --> 01:23:35,011
That was Lu's wish, for Dandan to dance.

602
01:24:13,258 --> 01:24:14,259
Teacher Yu.

603
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:42,954
Father.

604
01:24:43,830 --> 01:24:45,290
Why did you stop reading the letters?

605
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:54,507
Mother is looking for you.

606
01:24:56,092 --> 01:24:57,427
Do you know

607
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:02,515
how your mother looked at me

608
01:25:02,599 --> 01:25:05,351
when I read her my letters?

609
01:25:07,979 --> 01:25:11,024
If this goes on any longer,

610
01:25:11,482 --> 01:25:15,236
to her I'll eventually become
nothing more than a letter reader.

611
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:18,948
Father.

612
01:25:19,032 --> 01:25:23,286
Everything that you've done so far was
to be close to her, to take care of her.

613
01:25:26,247 --> 01:25:28,041
Does the rest really matter?

614
01:25:30,126 --> 01:25:31,669
Think about it.

615
01:25:33,046 --> 01:25:35,048
I'm going to check on her.

616
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:06,579
Hello, Teacher Yu.

617
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:10,625
- You are...
- You forgot?

618
01:26:13,503 --> 01:26:15,546
I'm the letter reader.

619
01:26:16,005 --> 01:26:17,006
Oh!

620
01:26:17,090 --> 01:26:18,341
The letter-reading comrade.

621
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:21,969
I've been waiting for you
since morning. Come in, please.

622
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:26,349
Teacher Yu,

623
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:30,436
would you like me to read you
the most recent letters?

624
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:44,659
"Another year has gone by.
We are getting old.

625
01:26:45,159 --> 01:26:47,620
"I've grown forgetful.

626
01:26:48,454 --> 01:26:49,622
"How about you?

627
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:54,043
"If you are in the same boat,
I'd suggest not going out so often.

628
01:26:54,585 --> 01:26:56,129
"If you must go out,

629
01:26:56,212 --> 01:26:58,756
"write down our address
on a piece of paper

630
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:00,717
"and keep it in your pocket.

631
01:27:01,259 --> 01:27:04,345
"Or even better, take someone with you."

632
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,182
Teacher Yu.

633
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:09,934
Do you go out often?

634
01:27:13,354 --> 01:27:14,856
No, not really.

635
01:27:18,609 --> 01:27:21,446
I need to go to the train station on the 5th.

636
01:27:24,615 --> 01:27:26,576
Do you really have to?

637
01:27:27,702 --> 01:27:29,704
I have to pick up my husband.

638
01:27:30,163 --> 01:27:33,666
He told me he would return on the 5th.
I have to pick him up.

639
01:27:46,387 --> 01:27:48,347
"It's getting chilly.

640
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:52,018
"It's going to be a cold winter.
Remember to stay warm.

641
01:27:52,435 --> 01:27:54,896
"Don't forget to seal the stove at night,

642
01:27:54,979 --> 01:27:57,356
"or gas will leak out.

643
01:27:57,857 --> 01:28:00,359
"I heard you and Dandan

644
01:28:00,443 --> 01:28:02,779
"are having some problems.

645
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:04,530
"She is very sad.

646
01:28:04,614 --> 01:28:07,575
"She said you only remember her mistakes

647
01:28:07,658 --> 01:28:10,369
"and that you don't want to see her."

648
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:13,164
Teacher Yu, is that true?

649
01:28:16,292 --> 01:28:18,878
"Yu, I'm so sorry.

650
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:21,881
"I have been the cause
of all the changes in your lives.

651
01:28:22,548 --> 01:28:24,550
"Dandan is a little headstrong.

652
01:28:25,051 --> 01:28:28,262
"Whatever mistakes she may have made,

653
01:28:28,346 --> 01:28:30,515
"she's just a child.

654
01:28:30,973 --> 01:28:32,975
"Everyone makes mistakes.

655
01:28:33,559 --> 01:28:35,645
"I'm already a bad father,

656
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:39,816
"I'm depending on you to be a good mother.

657
01:28:43,236 --> 01:28:47,949
"I don't think it was right to kick her out.

658
01:28:50,201 --> 01:28:53,246
"I hope you will let her come back home."

659
01:28:59,585 --> 01:29:02,964
- Lu said that?
- Yes. Look.

660
01:29:06,092 --> 01:29:07,093
Oh.

661
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:24,652
Come in.

662
01:29:26,279 --> 01:29:28,990
Dandan.
We're going home.

663
01:29:29,282 --> 01:29:30,283
Hmm?

664
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:33,995
- Father. ls Mother really okay with this?
- Of course.

665
01:29:34,078 --> 01:29:35,454
Why did she agree?

666
01:29:35,913 --> 01:29:37,707
You'll find out.

667
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:44,255
Okay.

668
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:47,550
Go, go in.

669
01:30:02,023 --> 01:30:03,024
Mother.

670
01:30:04,275 --> 01:30:05,985
Dandan.

671
01:30:06,068 --> 01:30:07,361
Come. Come in.

672
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,575
I've got something to tell you.
Come in.

673
01:30:26,756 --> 01:30:28,424
These are your father's letters.

674
01:30:28,841 --> 01:30:31,177
- So many?
- Yes.

675
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:33,262
Lots of them.

676
01:30:47,443 --> 01:30:49,528
Your father wrote that

677
01:30:51,656 --> 01:30:54,116
you should move back home.

678
01:30:59,080 --> 01:31:00,539
He also said that...

679
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:05,336
I was wrong to let you live alone.

680
01:31:09,674 --> 01:31:10,675
Dandan.

681
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:15,638
Why not move out of the academy
and come back home?

682
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:24,981
Here's what he wrote.

683
01:31:40,329 --> 01:31:41,747
Come home.

684
01:33:25,851 --> 01:33:27,770
Mother. Did you like it?

685
01:33:32,525 --> 01:33:33,859
What role was that?

686
01:33:34,318 --> 01:33:37,154
Wu <i>Qinghua in
The Red Detachment of Women.</i>

687
01:33:37,530 --> 01:33:38,531
Oh

688
01:33:40,199 --> 01:33:42,785
The soldier is a good role too.

689
01:33:43,452 --> 01:33:45,871
I thought the costume would help,
but I guess it didn't work.

690
01:34:12,106 --> 01:34:14,066
Come. Eat it while it's hot.

691
01:34:29,665 --> 01:34:30,666
She's sleeping.

692
01:35:12,124 --> 01:35:14,627
Fang. What are you doing?

693
01:35:15,669 --> 01:35:17,129
Lu was not executed.

694
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:20,090
He was not executed.
I'm indebted to you for life.

695
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:23,802
But you can't do this again.
You can't touch me again. Get out!

696
01:35:23,886 --> 01:35:26,180
I won't allow it anymore.
Get out.

697
01:35:26,263 --> 01:35:27,681
- Out.
- Yu!

698
01:35:28,224 --> 01:35:30,559
Get out! You leave!

699
01:35:31,352 --> 01:35:34,063
Get out!
I won't be violated again!

700
01:35:34,146 --> 01:35:35,898
- Yu!
- Get out!

701
01:35:36,732 --> 01:35:38,275
- Get out!
- Mother, calm down!

702
01:35:38,359 --> 01:35:40,236
- Out!
- Mother.

703
01:35:42,071 --> 01:35:43,739
Mother, open the door!

704
01:35:43,822 --> 01:35:45,199
Mother!

705
01:35:50,704 --> 01:35:51,705
Mother!

706
01:35:55,918 --> 01:35:57,044
Out!

707
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:01,298
Mother!

708
01:36:06,428 --> 01:36:08,430
Get out!

709
01:36:09,682 --> 01:36:11,058
Mother!

710
01:36:12,017 --> 01:36:13,310
Mother!

711
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:15,980
Open the door!

712
01:36:18,899 --> 01:36:20,693
Dandan!

713
01:36:21,151 --> 01:36:22,820
Come here.

714
01:36:23,654 --> 01:36:25,030
Come!

715
01:36:28,409 --> 01:36:29,410
Hurry!

716
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,714
When did Fang do this to your mother?

717
01:36:45,217 --> 01:36:46,552
When?

718
01:36:48,887 --> 01:36:50,264
Tell me!

719
01:36:51,724 --> 01:36:53,267
I was little...

720
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:57,229
I only remember one time.
He was hitting her with a ladle.

721
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:14,455
Thank you.

722
01:37:39,229 --> 01:37:40,230
Fang?

723
01:37:46,779 --> 01:37:48,155
Fang?

724
01:37:48,238 --> 01:37:49,782
Who is it?

725
01:37:51,742 --> 01:37:53,535
Who are you?

726
01:37:53,994 --> 01:37:55,579
Is Fang home?

727
01:37:57,414 --> 01:37:59,666
Are you with the investigation?

728
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,752
I was just about to go to your office.

729
01:38:01,835 --> 01:38:03,712
When will my Fang be released?

730
01:38:03,796 --> 01:38:05,714
What did he do?

731
01:38:05,798 --> 01:38:08,717
How dare you investigate him!

732
01:38:08,801 --> 01:38:11,762
Everyone knows Fang is a nice guy!

733
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:13,806
He's been gone for so long.

734
01:38:13,889 --> 01:38:16,350
When will you release him? Give me a date.

735
01:38:17,434 --> 01:38:19,186
It's just me and my child.

736
01:38:19,269 --> 01:38:22,189
Day in and day out we wait for him.
We want him back for the New Year!

737
01:38:22,272 --> 01:38:24,942
Tell me!
When will he be released?

738
01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:26,777
How much longer do we have to wait?

739
01:38:26,860 --> 01:38:27,861
Tell me!

740
01:38:28,237 --> 01:38:29,780
Answer me!

741
01:38:30,322 --> 01:38:32,199
When will he get out?

742
01:38:32,282 --> 01:38:33,742
Give us back my husband!

743
01:38:33,826 --> 01:38:35,994
He's a good man, you hear me?

744
01:38:36,078 --> 01:38:37,996
You should be locked up!

745
01:38:38,789 --> 01:38:40,374
Come back, don't leave!

746
01:38:43,001 --> 01:38:44,628
You come back!

747
01:39:09,361 --> 01:39:12,656
Mother, don't wait anymore.
The letter reader is ill.

748
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:16,243
Oh.

749
01:39:17,703 --> 01:39:19,246
I'll put them away.

750
01:39:22,040 --> 01:39:23,876
It's New Year's Eve.
Let's have dumplings.

751
01:39:28,714 --> 01:39:30,716
What did you just say?

752
01:39:31,383 --> 01:39:32,426
He's ill?

753
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:34,595
He caught a cold.
He's fine, nothing serious.

754
01:41:30,627 --> 01:41:34,339
PICK UP LU ON THE 5TH.
