487
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,800
If you harm one hair on his head...

488
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,240
Now, you stinking little stain!

489
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,480
I'm going to ask you politely,
one last time.

490
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,840
Where is he?

491
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,850
CARNY OWNER: Ah, there you are.

492
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
So, had enough time
to look over the property?

493
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,690
It's what you're looking for?

494
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,200
Well, it's garish, ugly
and smells like piss.

495
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:57,160
Can't quite make out
whether it's bums or rats, but it's piss.

496
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,360
I'm a connoisseur
when it comes to eau de toilette.

497
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,010
As for the rides,

498
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,160
any innocent little child
getting on one could be maimed or worse.

499
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,200
So you don't like it?

500
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,290
Don't like it?

501
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm crazy for it! (CHUCKLES)

502
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,200
Okay, okay, that's great.

503
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,720
So the price, with what you've
mentioned, we can negotiate.

504
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,880
No need to, sure your price is steep,
but as I look around,

505
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,080
all I can see is I'll be making a killing.

506
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,920
And money? Not a problem.

507
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Not anymore.

508
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,720
How'd it go? Did they like your act?

509
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,680
Well, they, uh...

510
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,640
They said they might call me.

511
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,720
I got nervous and blew a punch line.

512
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
Oh.

513
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,600
What do you mean, "Oh"?

514
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,880
I didn't mean anything.

515
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,010
Yes, you did, the way you said
"oh" like that.

516
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,850
Jesus, all I said was...

517
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,160
You said, "Oh."

518
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,730
As in, "Oh, so you didn't get the job?"

519
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,320
As in, "Oh, I should've known?"

520
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,760
As in, "Oh, so how are we going
to feed our baby?"

521
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,200
You think I'm not worried about that?

522
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,800
You think it's all a big joke to me?

523
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,400
I have to go up on stage

524
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,000
and nobody laughs.

525
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,880
And you think I don't care.

526
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,690
You think, you think... (CRYING)

527
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,880
Oh, God! Oh, God! I'm sorry!

528
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,800
I don't mean to take this out on you.

529
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:33,640
You're suffering enough,
being married to a loser.

530
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,360
- Honey, that's not...
- Yes, it is true.

531
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,680
I can't support you.

532
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,080
Oh, Jeannie.

533
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,050
Shh. It'll be okay.

534
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,560
The baby won't be here
for another three months.

535
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:50,090
Mrs. Berkis will let us slide on the rent
a little longer, she feels sorry for me.

536
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,330
She hates me.

537
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,920
She comes out in the hallway to scowl
at me every time I take the stairs.

538
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,600
That smell like cat litter and old people.

539
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:05,040
I've just got to get you out of here
before the baby comes.

540
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,040
All I need is enough money
to get us set up in a decent neighborhood.

541
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:15,250
For crying out loud, there are girls on
the street who earn that in a weekend

542
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,850
without having to tell a single joke
or blow a punch line.

543
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,600
(LAUGHS)

544
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,440
Come here and stop worrying about us.

545
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,200
I love you, job or no job.

546
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,840
You're good in the sack
and you make me laugh.

547
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,840
CARNY OWNER: Let me tell you something.

548
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,360
You ain't going to regret
buying this place.

549
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,160
It ain't as bad as it looks.

550
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,440
I hope you're wrong about that.

551
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,120
Come on, a little spit and polish,
you'll have yourself one hell of a carnival.

552
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,960
(CHUCKLES) Oh, you are so right,
and thanks to your smooth salesmanship

553
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:53,120
and your silver tongue,
I'm completely sold.

554
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,640
Let's shake on it.

555
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Sure, sure, it's my privilege.

556
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,610
Yes, yes, it is.

557
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,480
Who are they?

558
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,480
Spit and Polish, my attorneys.

559
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,640
They persuaded your partner
to sign over the deed about an hour ago.

560
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,920
The property's already mine.

561
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,520
I can see that you're happy about that.

562
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,120
Now, I must dash.

563
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,120
There's equipment to rent,
plus workers to hire,

564
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:22,120
and of course,
I need to secure my main attraction.

565
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,400
Uh, do feel free to stick around.

566
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,720
Your refreshments, Master Bruce.

567
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,800
Well, then, sir, do you need my further
assistance or should I just go away?

568
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,360
That'll be fine.

569
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,120
Trying to figure out
what he intends to do.

570
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,240
It's almost impossible.

571
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,370
Excuse me if I find that comforting, sir.

572
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,840
I don't know him, Alfred.

573
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:14,330
All these years and I don't know who he is
any more than he knows who I am.

574
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,250
Are you sure of that?

575
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
What do you mean?

576
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,160
I mean don't underestimate him.

577
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,600
I don't and neither should he
underestimate me.

578
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,720
You can't save everyone, sir.

579
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,280
He drives me.

580
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,000
How can two people hate so much
without knowing each other?

581
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,640
I hate this. Whenever we jail him, I pray,
"Please, God, just keep him there."

582
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,280
And then when he escapes, it's,

583
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,920
"Please don't let him
do something too awful this time."

584
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,080
I hate it.

585
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,640
Dad, just once, could you leave
your work at the office and relax?

586
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,610
I made you some cocoa.

587
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,600
Thanks, but tonight
I could use something a little stiffer.

588
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,320
You know, I found that
Catwoman scrapbook you couldn't.

589
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,080
It was behind the wardrobe.

590
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,330
You really ought to let me work
out a filing system for you,

591
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,320
something like we use at the library.

592
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,570
GORDON: Mmm-hmm.

593
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,640
Oh, look.

594
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,400
You've got paste squidging out,
don't get it on your pants.

595
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,960

you're fussier than your mother was.

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,560
We're going to work out.

599
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,280
You'll have to entertain her
while I get ready.

600
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,640
(CHUCKLES) Look at this one.
First time they met.

601
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,640
He was just robbing banks then. Remember?

602
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,920
What I remember is you describing
his white face and green hair.

603
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,240
I was just a kid,
scared the hell out of me.

604
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,800
GORDON: I thought you'd be interested.

605
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,200
Yeah, well, I had some
really interesting nightmares.

It's just a psychological manifestation,

She thinks she's a coffee table edition,

though I can't say much
for this volume's condition.

614
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,680
I mean there's a hole in the jacket

Refreshing to hear, not by the book.

Speaking of which, this one won't be
walking off the shelf anytime soon.

In fact, the idea
of her walking anywhere seems remote.

Here's to crime.

You see, I have a reason, a good one.

633
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,160
I have to prove myself...

634

As a husband and a father.

635

Of course.

638
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,930
Did I ever tell you
I started out as a lab assistant?

639
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,360
Of course, I did, right?

640

because when they laugh, they feel good.

00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,040
The thing is... (SCOFFS) They didn't.

644
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,480
Now I'm not feeling good.

645
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,040
That's why I'm here, for one big score!

646
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,240
Hey, can you try and be cool?

647
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:10,280
Sorry, I usually don't drink at lunchtime.

648
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,680
You're not lying when you say
we'll get away with it?

649
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,640
Nobody will know I was involved?

650
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,280
Not to worry, friend.
We'll take care of you.

651
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,120
We need your help getting into that
chemical plant you used to work in

652
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,360
and into the playing card company
next door.

653

It's your expertise we appreciate.

654
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,640
And to absolutely guarantee
ain't nobody connects you to the robbery,

655
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,080
you'll be wearing this.

656
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Wait a minute,
I've seen that before in the papers.

657
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,800
That's the Red Hood's mask.

658
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,760
He raided that ice company last month.

659
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,640
Smarten up, wise guy.

660
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,370
There ain't no Red Hood.

661
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:50,040
Just a bunch of guys
like yourself and a mask.

662
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,770
Right, the most valued member of the crew,

663
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,440
he gets to wear it, no questions asked.

664
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,040
'Cause he needs the...

"so he deserves additional anonymity."

668
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:07,120
Sure. That makes sense, right? That's you.

669
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,850
But there aren't any eye slits.

670
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:10,330
How am I supposed to see?

671
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,520
Well, therein lies the beauty.

672
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,680
Two-way mirrors,
just like the cops use, huh?

673

That chemical plant...

675
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,530
I quit 'cause it creeped me out.

676
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:28,840
So grim and ugly,
it was getting under my skin.

677
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,120
But you know it
like the back of your hand.

678
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,400
Right.

679
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,130
But this ain't about you, though.

680
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,520
No. No, of course not.

681
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:41,120
Just this once,
then I can lead a proper life.

682
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,440
Exactly.

Starting Saturday morning, I'll be rich.

Just trying to imagine that,
my life, completely changed.

Nothing will be the same...

She found the, uh, victim

No, no, it's not okay.

Yes, memory is so treacherous.

One moment you're lost in a carnival

you'd rather forget.

Memories are what our reason is based on.

keep right on thinking that.

wear a suit and a bow tie.

I can't.

There's no reason anymore.

Jeannie's dead.

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,960
Oh, no, no, no, I'm sorry about your wife,

791

but what's happening tonight,
it's no little thing.

And we can't ensure that
anybody backing out remains healthy.

00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:47,240
- (SCREAMS)
- Swear to me!

805
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,360
You! I swear to you.

806
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:52,800
When he escapes, it ain't long till he
comes around, recruiting, you know?

807
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:55,120
But not this time. Nobody's seen him.

808
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,400
(GROANS)

809
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,920
MAN: Yeah?

810
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,880
Step away from the door.

811
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,600
Oh, shit.

812
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,280
(MAN SCREAMS)

813
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:20,400
(GRUNTING)

814
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,160
(SCREAMS)

815
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,320
You done?

816
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,320
- Yeah, I heard he got out again.
- You heard?

817
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,080
Read.

818
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,490
Calm down, I have no idea where he is

819
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,840
or what in the hell
he's got planned, trust me.

820
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,490
I can't trust you.

821
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,440
No, but believe me.

822
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:47,450
If I knew anything, I'd tell you, honest.

823
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,050
People in my, uh...

824
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,530
Let's call it "line of work."

825
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,880
Criminals.

826
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,720
Yeah, we may be scared of you.

827
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:56,810
We're terrified of him.

828
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:16,640
Order in the court! Order in the court!

829
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,290
I'll have ham on rye.

830
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,930
(ALL GROAN IN DISGUST)

831
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:23,080
It doesn't have to be good
to be a classic.

832
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:27,240
So, Commissioner, I need your help.

833
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,890
Is that why I'm here?

834
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:34,480
That's why you're here right now,
like right now, as in this moment.

835
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,400
Do me a favor and live in it, okay?

836
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:39,840
Anyway, me and my colleagues,
we couldn't come up with

837
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,320
one sound mind and body between us.

838
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,960
So, we're counting on yours.

839
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,320
What should be done with someone
who has no regard for the law?

840
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,800
- ALL: Yeah!
- WOMAN: He's right.

841
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,560
Someone who treats people like meat!

842
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,640
A man who has no problem
brutalizing his fellow man to get his way.

843
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,000
- Now, now.
- What would you do to a man

844
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,890
who breaks the laws
you are sworn to uphold?

845
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:06,160
A monster who ignores
everything you stand for!

846
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,960
Come on, is it that bad?

847
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:12,170
Yes, it is, and if it were up to me...

848
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,640
Right now, it is.

849
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,920
I'd throw the book at him.

850
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,240
ALL: (CHANTING) Throw the book!

851
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,680
Throw the book!
Throw the book! Throw the book!

852
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:26,480
(CHANTING CONTINUES)

853
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:34,040
What are you waiting for?
Throw it! Throw it!

854
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,080
- (ALL CONTINUE CHANTING)
- JOKER: Throw it! Throw it!

855
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,520
Throw the book!

856
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,530
Right on target.

857
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,040
Truth is, Commissioner,

858
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,720
the man on trial here,
you consider your friend.

859
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,960
WOMAN: Nope, which is funny.

860
00:54:58,120 --> 00:54:59,160
Funny?

861
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,920
Yeah, he usually comes
around here, right away.

862
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,520
Like before it's even on the news,

863
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,840
he broke out of the nuthouse again,
he's had a roll.

864
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,010
You'd think the most important
thing for him is to...

865
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,680
What?

866
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,400
- (GIGGLING)
- Have a good time.

867
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,000
So, why do you think
he hasn't been to visit?

868
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:17,400
I don't know.

869
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,440
Maybe, he found himself another girl.

870
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,480
Hey, somebody wants you.

871
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,280
(WHIMPERING)

872
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,560
Uh-uh-uh. No fair hiding.

873
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,600
(WHIMPERING)

874
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,050
Ugh. Well, I'd see why.

875
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,560
You don't look so good.

876
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:45,160
Well, I don't blame you, not when that
bowl of cherries some call life,

877
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:48,170
turned out to be the pits of hell.
(CHUCKLES)

878
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:52,450
Perhaps, a song might
bring a smile to your face.

879
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,720
(SINGING) When the world is full of care

880
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,480
And every headline screams despair

881
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:08,090
When all is rape,
starvation, war and life is vile

882
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,810
Then there's a certain thing I do

883
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,800
Which I shall pass along to you

884
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:20,330
That's always guaranteed to make me smile

885
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,600
Yes!

886
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,240
I go loony

887
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,280
As a light bulb-battered bug

888
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,360
Simply loony

889
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:35,120
Sometimes foam and chew the rug

890
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:38,720
Mister, life is swell in a padded cell

891
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,690
It'll chase those blues away

892
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:44,520
You can trade your gloom for a rubber room

893
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:47,080
And injections twice a day

894
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,400
Just go loony like an acid casualty

895
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:53,920
Or a Moonie or a preacher on TV

896
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,520
(LAUGHING)

897
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:02,120
When the human race wears an anxious face

898
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,760
When the bomb hangs overhead

899
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,600
When your kid turns blue

900
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,410
It won't worry you

901
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:14,320
You can smile and nod instead

902
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:17,370
When you're loony

903
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:20,250
Then you just don't give a fig

904
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,680
Man's so puny

905
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,160
And the universe so big

906
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,890
Barbara? No!

907
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,680
If you hurt inside, get certified

908
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,610
And if life should treat you bad

909
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,210
Barbara! Barbara!

910
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,960
Don't get even, get mad

911
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:40,360
Barbara!

912
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,880
Yes!

913
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:03,120
Ah, here they are now.

914
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:08,280
Holy Christ! That must be
the best ghost train in the business.

915
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,760
I mean, when they went in,
the fellow in the middle

916
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:13,240
didn't look a day over 17.

917
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,560
(LAUGHING) Well, that's what
a dose of reality will do to you.

918
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,240
It's why I never touch the stuff.

919
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:23,760
I find it waters down the hallucinations.

920
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,040
So, Commissioner, how's things?

921
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,920
Commissioner? Hello? Anybody home?

922
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:39,200
Oh. This wasn't supposed to
turn out boring.

923
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,840
Oh, put him away in his cage.

924
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,760
We're about to open for business.

925
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,280
Let's hope our main
attraction gets livelier.

926
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,440
Give him time to reflect upon life

927
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,760
and all its random uncontrollability.

928
00:59:01,840 --> 00:59:04,080
THUG 1:
Hey, quit your daydreaming, friend.

929
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,360
It's showtime.

930
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:08,000
I was just remembering.

931
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,690
I used to walk along here
to work each morning.

932
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,640
Ah, that's good, real good.

933
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,480
That's just what we need you to do.

934
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,560
THUG 2: Just guide us through
this stinking factory

935
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,880
so we can get to the joint next door.

936
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,160
And stay far away from us
while we do the dirty work.

937
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,120
It's like we're practically giving you
money by cutting you in on this.

938
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:28,480
Right now?

939
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:30,160
Will I be able to breathe?

940
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:31,650
Not if you smoke.

941
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:33,850
(CHUCKLES) That's a good one.

942
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:37,680
Maybe, I should be looking into your line
of work instead of you looking into mine.

943
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:39,770
You got a funny shaped head.

944
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,930
Maybe I should've been a clown
instead of a comedian.

945
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:45,320
There. You can see, friend?

946
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:48,120
(ECHOES) Yeah, but everything's red,

947
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:51,250
stuffy too and it smells.

948
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:52,850
Ooh, my voice sounds echo-y.

949
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,600
THUG 2: Then shut up and get to work.

950
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:02,880
RED HOOD: Okay, we go through here
past the filter tanks

951
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:06,080
and then Monarch Playing Cards
is just beyond the partition.

952
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:09,040
You know this place looks
even worse in red.

953
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:12,120
- It looks like...
- GUARD: Hey, you! Freeze!

954
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,600
Come on, come on, get 'em up!

955
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,280
Murph, get some men over to the rear bays.

956
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,400
We're being robbed by the Red Hood Mob.

957
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,120
You asshole!
You said there was no security.

958
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,160
RED HOOD:
They must have altered things since I left.

959
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,720
- (AIR HISSING)
- It's so loud.

960
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:34,920
For God's sake, run!
This is all screwed up, run!

961
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:41,400
Man, which way?

962
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:43,240
I can't see where I'm going.

963

Maybe another night, Dad,
I got plans tonight.

01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,120
I can't help it

I'll talk to you, later.
