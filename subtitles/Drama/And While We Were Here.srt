YOU KNOW THAT.

( object clatters )

81
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,514
JUST DIDN'T SOUND
VERY SUPPORTIVE.

82
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:36,121
YOU HAVE MY SUPPORT.
I'M SORRY IF THAT
CAME OUT WRONG.

83
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,026

HE KILLED HIMSELF?

00:08:14,527 --> 00:08:16,094
WHO?

90
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:19,965
DAVID FOSTER WALLACE.

I... I...
I DON'T KNOW.

92

YOU CAN'T GET A SENSE
BY HIS WRITING?

93
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,406
YOU'LL HAVE TO READ IT
WHEN I'M DONE, DARLING.

94
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:37,249
DO YOU THINK HE
RECOGNIZED A BLANK INFINITY

95
00:08:37,251 --> 00:08:39,050
JUST STRETCHING OUT?

96
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,255
HE GOT TO THIS POINT,
MAYBE, WHERE...

97
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,290
IT WAS JUST DAY
AFTER DAY AFTER DAY.

98
00:08:45,292 --> 00:08:49,461
I REALLY DON'T KNOW, JANE.
JUST SO TEDIOUS.

99
00:08:50,563 --> 00:08:53,031
AND THEN OF COURSE,
HE FELT GUILTY.

100
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:55,033
MOST PEOPLE THINK LIFE IS
TOO SHORT, AND THERE HE WAS,

101
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,102
ALL THE TALENT IN THE WORLD,
AND IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

102
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:59,337
JANE, CAN I--
CAN WE NOT TALK ABOUT THIS?

103
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,208
IT'S JUST A BIT MORBID.

LOVE YOU, TOO.

107
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,182
DO YOU FEEL ALL RIGHT?

108
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:46,384
YOU FEEL OKAY?
YEAH.

109
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:48,687
YOU SURE?

110
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,125
MM-HMM.

111
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:13,478

YOU WON'T COME WITH?

117
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,785
YOU'LL BE SO BUSY.

118
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,555
MIGHT GET BORING ALL ALONE.

119
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:33,692
I THINK SOMEONE
SHOULD BE HERE IN CASE
THE CARD IS DELIVERED.

120
00:11:33,694 --> 00:11:35,493
TRUE.

121
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,500
AND THEN I THINK I
MIGHT GO OUT, SEE WHAT
THE WORLD HAS TO OFFER.

122
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:46,271
WELL, IF YOU DO,
LEAVE ME A MESSAGE, OKAY?

123
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,176
SO I CAN WORRY ABOUT YOU.

124
00:11:51,178 --> 00:11:52,377
OKAY.

125
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,450
I'VE LEFT YOU
SOME MONEY HERE.

126
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,651
THANK YOU.

127
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,488
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

<i>IT'S AS VIVID TO ME</i>
<i>AS IF IT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.</i>

160
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:26,731
<i>OH, HI, LEONARD.</i>

161
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:28,433
<i>IT'S JANE.</i>

162
00:14:28,435 --> 00:14:31,402
I DECIDED TO TAKE
AN IMPROMPTU TRIP TO ISCHIA.

163
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:34,806
OR, UM, "EE-SCHIA,"
AS THEY PRONOUNCE IT.

164
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:37,809
SEE, I'M LEARNING
A LITTLE BIT. UM...

165
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:40,545
ANYWAY,
I'LL BE HOME LATER.

166
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,481
I HOPE YOU HAVE
A GOOD DAY. BYE.

167
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,650
Grandmother: <i>THOSE</i>
<i>FRIENDS</i>
<i>ARE ALL DEAD NOW.</i>

168
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,719
<i>THERE'S NO ONE LEFT.</i>

169
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:51,356
<i>THAT'S ONE OF</i>
<i>MY REGRETS, YOU KNOW.</i>

170
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:53,625
<i>SOMETIMES I THINK</i>
<i>I SHOULD HAVE HAD</i>
<i>MORE CHILDREN,</i>

171
00:14:53,627 --> 00:14:56,361
<i>NOT JUST YOUR FATHER.</i>

172
00:14:56,363 --> 00:15:00,465
<i>YOU'RE ALL ALONE NOW THAT</i>
<i>YOUR PARENTS ARE GONE.</i>

173
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,567
<i>NO BROTHERS, NO SISTERS.</i>

174
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,506
<i>I'M UPSETTING YOU.</i>

175
00:15:08,508 --> 00:15:10,475
Jane: <i>LET'S TALK</i>
<i>ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

176
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:14,379
<i>YOU WANT TO ASK ME</i>
<i>MORE BORING QUESTIONS</i>
<i>ABOUT THE WAR?</i>

177
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:15,847
<i>ALL RIGHT, THEN.</i>

178
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:20,518
( speaking
rudimentary Italian )

179
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,953
THE CASTLE?

180
00:15:21,955 --> 00:15:23,521
CASTLE?

181
00:15:23,523 --> 00:15:25,523
( asking question
in rudimentary Italian )

182
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:26,858
NO?
NO.

183
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,393
UM...

184
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:30,528
( speaking
rudimentary Italian )

185
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:36,434
AH.
( both speaking Italian )

186
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,803
Grandmother: <i>HE'D BEEN SHOT</i>
<i>THROUGH THE NECK.</i>

187
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:42,807
<i>THE BULLET WENT IN</i>
<i>ONE SIDE AND CAME OUT</i>
<i>THE OTHER.</i>

188
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:45,610
<i>AND THERE WERE</i>
<i>ALL THESE BOMB HOLES</i>
<i>FILLED WITH WATER,</i>

189
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,612
<i>AND HE COULDN'T TELL</i>
<i>WHICH WAS THE GERMAN SIDE</i>

190
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,981
<i>AND WHICH</i>
<i>WAS THE ALLIED SIDE.</i>

191
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:53,551
<i>WHEN HE CAME HOME</i>
<i>AFTER SOMETHING LIKE THAT,</i>

192
00:15:53,553 --> 00:15:55,019
<i>YOU COULDN'T REALLY</i>
<i>COMPLAIN TO HIM</i>

193
00:15:55,021 --> 00:15:56,854
<i>ABOUT ANYTHING,</i>
<i>NOW COULD YOU?</i>

194
00:15:56,856 --> 00:15:58,690
I'M ACTUALLY
GOING THERE NOW.

195
00:15:58,692 --> 00:15:59,824
TO THE CASTLE.

196
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,559
YOU SPEAK ENGLISH NOW?
YEAH.

197
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:02,794
WHY, DID YOU THINK
I WAS ITALIAN?

198
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,462
YEAH.
YES!

199
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,897
THAT'S GREAT, THAT'S COOL.

200
00:16:05,899 --> 00:16:09,534
HEY, HEY, HEY.
WHERE YOU FROM?

201
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,970
LONDON.
NO, IN AMERICA, COME ON.

202
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,871
MAINE.
NO SHIT.

203
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:16,975
I'M FROM MASSACHUSETTS.
THAT'S CRAZY. THAT'S WEIRD.

204
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:18,643
RIGHT?
YEAH.

205
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19,844
VACATION?

206
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,012
OH.
ARE YOU?

207
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,747
WHAT?
ARE YOU HERE ON VACATION?

208
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,020
SORRY. I THOUGHT
YOU WERE SAYING YOU
WERE ON VACATION.

209
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:31,456
ME? NO.

210
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:32,724
SO, COME ON.

211
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,761
MY HUSBAND
IS WORKING IN NAPLES.

212
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,863
WHAT DOES HE DO?

213
00:16:38,865 --> 00:16:41,733
HE IS PLAYING IN A CONCERT
AT THE END OF THE MONTH.

214
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:44,469
<i>COOL.</i> WHAT DOES HE PLAY?

215
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:45,636
VIOLA.

216
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,839
MNH MNH MNH!
THE VIOLA!

217
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:51,009
HE ANY GOOD?

218
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,577
YES. VERY.

219
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,915
HOW DO YOU KEEP YOUR
VIOLIN FROM GETTING STOLEN?

220
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,688
YOU PUT IT IN
A VIOLA CASE. RIGHT?

221
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,590
NO, THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

222
00:17:05,592 --> 00:17:08,893
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A VIOLA AND A COFFIN?

223
00:17:08,895 --> 00:17:12,030
A COFFIN HAS
A DEAD PERSON
ON THE <i>INSIDE.</i>

224
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,065
'CAUSE VIOLA PLAYERS
ARE DEAD, NO?

225
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,635
WHY IS A VIOLA SOLO
LIKE PREMATURE EJACULATION?

226
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19,070
( snickers )

227
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:21,973
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH
YOU KNOW IT'S COMING,

228
00:17:21,975 --> 00:17:25,576
THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

229
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:28,046
I CAN'T HELP IT,
I'VE GOT THIS WEIRD
AUTISTIC MIND FOR JOKES,

230
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,815
AND I WENT TO THIS
MUSIC-SLASH-NERD SUMMER
CAMP WHEN I WAS, LIKE, 10,

231
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:32,650
AND I PLAYED THE TRIANGLE.
RIGHT.

232
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,552
AND I'M
AN ONLY CHILD, SO...

233
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:35,887
YOU KNOW, UNDERSTAND.

234
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:41,059
YOU LOOK TOO YOUNG
TO BE MARRIED.
ARE YOU A NEWLYWED?

235
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,960
NO.

236
00:17:42,962 --> 00:17:44,162
NO.

237
00:17:53,806 --> 00:17:55,807
YOU'RE MAKING ME FEEL
LIKE A STALKER. FUCK.

238
00:17:55,809 --> 00:17:58,142
( speaking Italian )

239
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:02,847
Woman:
<i>GRAZIE.</i>

240
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,816
<i>GRAZIE.</i>

241
00:18:04,818 --> 00:18:05,950
<i>UNO.</i>

242
00:18:05,952 --> 00:18:07,151
ALL RIGHT.

243
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,022
UH, HEY,
HAVE YOU GOT 50 CENTS?

244
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,859
IF YOU CAN CATCH IT.

245
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,763
<i>GRAZIE.</i>
<i>GRAZIE.</i>

246
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,787
WHAT BROUGHT YOU
OUT HERE TODAY?

247
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,859
THE FERRY.
HA! "THE FERRY."
I LIKE IT.

248
00:18:47,861 --> 00:18:49,994
THEY HAVE THIS DEVICE
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

249
00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:52,597
IT'S LIKE A TORTURE CAGE.
THEY'D LOCK YOU IN THERE

250
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:55,600
UNTIL YOU TURNED TO BONES.

251
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,936
BUT CAN YOU IMAGINE DYING
BY JUST SITTING THERE?
THAT WOULD SUCK.

252
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:07,011
IN, LIKE, THE 1300s,

253
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:09,213
THOUSANDS OF FAMILIES
LIVED IN THIS CASTLE.

254
00:19:09,215 --> 00:19:11,716
MUST'VE SMELLED
PRETTY BAD,

255
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:14,218
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
CRAMMED ONTO THIS ROCK.

256
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,924
WOW.
I KNOW.

257
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:23,628
I'VE BEEN COMING HERE
EVERY DAY, AND IT
STILL GETS ME.

258
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,764
IF ONLY WE COULD
KILL OFF ALL THE TOURISTS.

259
00:19:26,766 --> 00:19:29,033
( scoffs )
YOU'RE A TOURIST.

260
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,035
NO I'M NOT.

261
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:33,037
I CAME OUT HERE
A FEW MONTHS AGO

262
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,774
WITH THIS VOLUNTEER
ORGANIZATION DEDICATED
TO STUDYING

263
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:39,177
THE RELIC POPULATIONS
OF DOLPHINS AND WHALES

264
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,212
IN THE GULF OF NAPLES.

265
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,014
I CAN'T TELL
IF YOU'RE JOKING.

266
00:19:43,016 --> 00:19:46,651
I'M DEAD FUCKIN' SERIOUS.

267
00:19:46,653 --> 00:19:50,021
NO, I JUST DIDN'T WANNA
GO TO COLLEGE, AND THEY
PAID FOR ME TO COME OVER.

268
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,023
FOUR CONNECTING FLIGHTS,
A 72-HOUR PLANE RIDE.

269
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,058
BUT, YOU KNOW...
IT WAS WORTH IT.

270
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,793
MY FIRST TIME
OUT OF THE U.S.

271
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,028
HOW OLD ARE YOU?
I'M 19.

272
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:58,930
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TODAY.

273
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:00,798
IS IT REALLY?
UH-HUH.

274
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,867
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

275
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,937
YEAH, SO, I LEFT
THE PROGRAM AFTER,
LIKE, A MONTH.

276
00:20:05,939 --> 00:20:08,673
FUCK THE RELIC DOLPHINS!

277
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,741
I'M STILL ON THE ISLAND
'CAUSE I HAVE THIS--

278
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:12,143
THIS AWESOME
LIVING SITUATION.

279
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:13,878
I'LL TELL YOU
THE SHORT VERSION.

280
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,980
BASICALLY, I USED TO HAVE
ANCESTORS IN ISCHIA,

281
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:18,816
SO WHEN I COME OVER,
I FACEBOOKED THIS SECOND
COUSIN TWICE REMOVED.

282
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:21,085
A SECOND COUSIN TWICE REMOVED,
IN CASE YOU DIDN'T KNOW,

283
00:20:21,087 --> 00:20:22,820
IS WHEN ONE PERSON'S
GREAT-GRANDPARENT

284
00:20:22,822 --> 00:20:24,956
IS ANOTHER PERSON'S
GREAT-GREAT-GREAT GRANDPARENT.

285
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,791
I'D LOVE TO HEAR
THE LONG VERSION.

286
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,226
SORRY. ANYWAY...

287
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,828
SO THIS RELATIVE GAVE ME
THE NAME OF THIS GREAT UNCLE

288
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,731
WHO LIVES ON THE ISLAND.
SO I SHOW UP...

289
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,968
HE ANSWERS THE DOOR
AND HE'S LIKE THE OLDEST
FUCKER I'VE EVER SEEN.

290
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,004
EASILY PUSHING 100.
100?

291
00:20:40,006 --> 00:20:43,808
YEAH, IF NOT OLDER.
HE'S, LIKE, DEAF AND BLIND
AND ABOUT FOUR FEET TALL,

292
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,911
AND HE MUMBLES A COUPLE
THINGS TO ME IN SOME
CRAZY DIALECT,

293
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,846
USHERS ME INSIDE,
POURS ME A GLASS OF WINE,

294
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:50,915
AND LEADS ME
TO THIS BASEMENT APARTMENT.

295
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,883
AND, UH, YEAH,
I NEVER LEFT.

296
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,058
<i>( female vocalist</i>
<i>singing operatic music )</i>

297
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,344
<i>( operatic music fades )</i>

298

303
00:22:05,924 --> 00:22:08,292
VITTORIA COLONNA.

304
00:22:08,294 --> 00:22:10,261
AH. THE WOMAN
WHO LIVED HERE.

305
00:22:10,263 --> 00:22:13,397
YOU READ THAT
IN YOUR GUIDEBOOK
THIS MORNING,

306
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,166
DIDN'T YOU, JANE?

COMMITTING TO MEMORY

IN ENGLISH AND ITALIAN.

310
00:22:24,911 --> 00:22:26,077
I THOUGHT
MICHELANGELO WAS GAY.

311
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:27,812
AH, ACCORDING TO HISTORY

312
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:31,349
AND THE MUSCULAR THIGHS
OF HIS SCULPTURES, YES.

313
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:34,018
BUT THAT DIDN'T STOP HER
FROM LOVING HIM.

314
00:22:35,287 --> 00:22:37,955
LET'S HEAR IT, THEN.

315
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:41,025
IN ITALIAN.
LET'S HEAR THE POEM.

316
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,294
COME ON.
OKAY, OKAY.

317
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:49,333
( reciting haltingly
in Italian )

318
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,989
( clapping )
WHEW!

319
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:15,126
I'M IMPRESSED.
THANK YOU.

320
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:17,261
YOU HUNGRY?

321
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:19,897
WHY? YOU GONNA
TAKE ME OUT?

322
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,365
YEAH.

323
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,104
ALL RIGHT THEN.
OKAY.

324
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:34,979
Caleb: TWO PASTAS WITH
THE HOUSE SAUCE, PLEASE.

325
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,881
RED, PLEASE.
Man: WHITE OR-- RED.

326
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,249
UH-HUH.
THANK YOU.

327
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,151
<i>GRAZIE.</i>

328
00:23:40,153 --> 00:23:43,087
SO YOU'RE REALLY NOT
GONNA TELL ME WHAT YOU DO?

329
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,194
I WRITE FREELANCE
ARTICLES ABOUT PARTIES
AND FASHION TRENDS

330
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:51,562
IN   <i>TOWN AND COUNTRY UK.</i>

331
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,265
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

332
00:24:00,472 --> 00:24:02,239
I'M WRITING A BOOK...

333
00:24:02,241 --> 00:24:05,309
ABOUT MY GRANDMOTHER'S
EXPERIENCES IN RURAL ENGLAND,

334
00:24:05,311 --> 00:24:08,112
LIVING THROUGH TWO WORLD WARS.

335
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,147
I RECORDED HER
FOR HOURS AND HOURS.

336
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:12,116
BUT NOW...

337
00:24:13,318 --> 00:24:15,286
I DON'T KNOW.

338
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,121
WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?

339
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,259
YOU WANNA LISTEN, A LITTLE?

340
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:23,527
YEAH.
YEAH?

341
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:26,230
YEAH, NO,
I LOVE TO LISTEN.

342
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:41,979
IT'S ALL TANGLED UP.

343
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,581
HOLD ON.
OKAY.

344
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:52,089
Grandmother: <i>AWFUL AS IT WAS,</i>
<i>IT MADE YOU STRONGER.</i>

345
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,959

<i>WHINE ABOUT ALL SORTS</i>
<i>OF THINGS,</i>

346
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,428

<i>THOSE OLD PEOPLE WHO</i>
<i>THINK MY TIME</i>

347
00:24:57,430 --> 00:25:00,531
<i>HAD THE ONLY JOY</i>
<i>AND THE ONLY PROBLEMS.</i>

348
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:03,501
<i>WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN</i>
<i>PRIVATE WARS, EVERY ERA.</i>

349
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:06,537
<i>BUT IT WAS NOTHING LIKE--</i>

350
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,273
<i>IT REALLY BROUGHT</i>
<i>PEOPLE TOGETHER, THE WAR.</i>

351
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:12,076
<i>WE HELPED EACH OTHER</i>
<i>DURING THAT TIME.</i>

352
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,545
<i>WE HAD TO LAUGH,</i>
<i>WE HAD TO SMILE.</i>

353
00:25:14,547 --> 00:25:16,981
<i>WELL, IF NOT</i>
<i>FOR OURSELVES,</i>

354
00:25:16,983 --> 00:25:18,482
<i>THEN FOR</i>
<i>THE PEOPLE WE'D LOST.</i>

355
00:25:18,484 --> 00:25:20,251
<i>NOW SHUT THAT THING OFF,</i>
<i>WOULD YOU?</i>

356
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:22,453
<i>GET IT OUT OF MY FACE!</i>

357
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,393
THAT IS LIKE--
IT'S LIKE A WINDOW IN TIME.

358
00:25:29,395 --> 00:25:31,996
THE SORT OF THING
YOU WISH YOU ALWAYS DID

359
00:25:31,998 --> 00:25:33,497
BEFORE SOMEONE DIED,
YOU KNOW?

360
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:36,200
MY HUSBAND THINKS
I'M NEVER GONNA FINISH IT.

361
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:39,336
YOU SHOULDN'T CARE
WHAT ANYONE THINKS.

362
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:42,206
WE MET WHILE
I WAS RECORDING HER.

363
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:44,008
BONDING OVER GRANNY, HUH?

364
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,210
YOU MAKE IT SOUND PERVERSE.

365
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,512
THAT'S WHAT IT WAS, RIGHT?

366
00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:52,416
( speaking Italian )

367
00:26:00,091 --> 00:26:02,159
I GOT PREGNANT,
SO WE GOT MARRIED.

368
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,366
I LOST THE BABY.

369
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:13,137
I'M SORRY.

370
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:26,283
( speaking Italian )

371
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,661
I DIDN'T GO
BACK AFTER THAT
TO THE STATES.

372
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,336
DID YOU, UH,

373
00:26:45,338 --> 00:26:48,272
DID YOU EVER HEAR
THAT STORY ABOUT
THE RED STRING?

374
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,376
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE.
TELL ME.

375
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,482
IT'S LIKE THIS
ASIAN PROVERB.

376
00:26:58,484 --> 00:27:02,486
SAYS THAT ANYONE
YOU'RE DESTINED
TO MEET, LIKE, UH,

377
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:07,391
YOUR SOUL MATE
OR YOUR FAMILY OR,
YOU KNOW,

378
00:27:07,393 --> 00:27:10,628
SOMEONE YOU BUMP
INTO ON THE STREET,
WE'RE ALL CONNECTED...

379
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,563
BY THIS RED STRING.

380
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:18,102
IT CAN BE TANGLED
OR STRETCHED,

381
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:20,170
BUT IT CAN NEVER
BE BROKEN.

382
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:27,645
THERE'S THIS MOMENT
IN THE TAPE.

383
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:29,513
I'M SITTING, WAITING,

384
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:33,117
IN THE AIRPORT BAR
FOR MY FLIGHT,

385
00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:35,119
AND I'M TALKING
INTO THE RECORDER,

386
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:37,521
RAMBLING ON ABOUT HOW
I'M ABOUT TO EMBARK

387
00:27:37,523 --> 00:27:40,224
ON THIS AMAZING ADVENTURE,

388
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,126
HOW I'M GONNA SHOW
WORLD WAR II

389
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,628
FROM A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.

390
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,463
BUT?

391
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,606
I DON'T KNOW
IF IT'S THAT INTERESTING.

392
00:27:55,608 --> 00:27:58,509
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT,
ISN'T IT?

393
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:02,646
KEEPING IT INTERESTING
FOR YOURSELF.

394
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,215
MAYBE.

395
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,687
MAYBE I JUST WANNA
WRITE ABOUT NOTHING.

396
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:11,588
EVERYTHING IS NOTHING.

397
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,590
ALL THE BEST.

398
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:19,163
( chuckles )
( both speaking Italian )

399
00:28:19,165 --> 00:28:21,632
MAKE A WISH, HUH?

400
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,668
MAKE IT GREAT.

401
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:28,772
OKAY.

402
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,343
BRAVO.

403
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,679
BRAVO. HEY.
( playful growl )

404
00:28:43,188 --> 00:28:45,422
ARE YOU READY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
AM I READY?

405
00:28:45,424 --> 00:28:47,725
GRAB MY HAND.
GO, GO, GO!
WHAT? WHY? OH, MY GOD!

406
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,526
GO!
OH, MY GOSH!

407
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:51,595
( shouting in Italian )

408
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,764
WHY? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
GO!

409
00:28:53,766 --> 00:28:57,334
( man shouting in Italian )

410
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,603
( shouting in Italian )

411
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,739
( indistinct,
panting remarks )

412
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:03,407
IT'S THE <i>CARIBINIERI!</i>
<i>WHAT?</i>

413
00:29:03,409 --> 00:29:05,576
THE POLICE! COME ON!
NO! NO! NO!

414
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,478
YEAH! YEAH, YEAH!

415
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,617
WE CAN'T GO BACK!
IF WE GO BACK,
WE GET ARRESTED!

416
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:16,520
OKAY.
RUN!

417
00:29:16,522 --> 00:29:18,722
WE CAN'T PAY
IF WE HAVEN'T
GOT ANY MONEY!

418
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,559
OH, GOD. COME HERE.

419
00:29:23,628 --> 00:29:24,828
OH, GOD.

420
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:33,637
HEY. HEY.
WHAT?

421
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:37,341
Would it make you
feel better if I said
I set the whole thing up?

422
00:29:37,343 --> 00:29:39,510
Yes, if it's true.

423
00:29:39,512 --> 00:29:41,545
Is it true?

424
00:29:41,547 --> 00:29:43,781
I paid the check when
I went to the bathroom.

425
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:46,750
( laughing )

426
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,519
You're horrible.

427
00:29:48,521 --> 00:29:50,387
You're horrible.

428
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:52,623
You're a mean,
horrible person.
Come on, let's go.

429
00:29:52,625 --> 00:29:56,326
Come on, come on.
Quick! Let's go!

430
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,798
Why are we still running?
I don't know why
we're still running.

431
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,711
( gasping )
OH, MY GOSH.

432
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,285
( laughing )

433
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:22,586
IT WENT UP MY NOSE.

434
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:24,354
( comical snort )

435
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,693
WILL YOU COME BACK?

436
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:30,894
MAYBE.

437
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:35,599
"MAYBE" IS NOT A "NO,"

438
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:38,435
AND SINCE I DON'T
HAVE A PHONE,

439
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:40,871
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
GIVE ME YOUR NUMBER.

440
00:30:40,873 --> 00:30:43,307
FOR CHEAP THRILLS
AND FUTURE CRIMES
COMMITTED.

441
00:30:43,309 --> 00:30:44,641
( emphatically )
NO.

442
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,779
FAIR ENOUGH.

443
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,523
I'D BETTER GO...

444
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,858
CATCH A FERRY.

445
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,529
HEY.

446
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,668
WHY DO VIOLISTS...

447
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,640
KEEP THEIR VIOLA CASES
ON THEIR DASHBOARDS?

448
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,017
WHY?

449
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,689
SO THEY CAN PARK
IN HANDICAPPED SPOTS.

450
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,729
OH.

451
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,530
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

452
00:31:40,532 --> 00:31:42,599
THANK YOU.

453
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:48,632
( distant,
indistinct shouting )

454
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,709
YOU'RE AWAKE.

455
00:32:58,711 --> 00:33:02,846
NO, I'VE GOT SO MUCH OF
THIS STUFF TO GET THROUGH.

456
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:04,848
YOU BOUGHT FRUIT.

457
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,516
NICE.

458
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:12,589
Grandmother: <i>THERE ARE</i>
<i>THE GREAT BIG EVENTS,</i>

<i>SO SHE HAD TO</i>
<i>SIT ON A BICYCLE SEAT.</i>

467
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,780
<i>THEY STAY WITH ME, TOO.</i>

468
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,687
( distant traffic sounds )

469
00:33:46,958 --> 00:33:49,960
JANE. JANEY?

470
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,096
GOT SOME PASTRIES.

471
00:33:57,902 --> 00:33:59,569
YOU STILL ASLEEP?

472
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,105
JANE?

473
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:29,533
Grandmother:
<i>MY FRIENDS HAD LOTS</i>
<i>OF AMERICAN BOYFRIENDS,</i>

474
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,902
<i>AND THEY USED TO</i>
<i>BRING US NYLON STOCKINGS</i>
<i>AND CHOCOLATES</i>

475
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,004
<i>AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS.</i>

476
00:34:34,006 --> 00:34:37,007
<i>AND WE USED TO GO</i>
<i>TO LONDON, AND...</i>

477
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:39,142
<i>WE SAW GLEN MILLER</i>
<i>ONE TIME.</i>

478
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:42,946
<i>OH, WE USED TO GO</i>
<i>ALL OVER THE PLACE.</i>

479
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,849
<i>THEY WERE WONDERFUL TIMES.</i>

480
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:48,819
<i>I NEVER HAD</i>
<i>AN AMERICAN BOYFRIEND.</i>

481
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:50,654
<i>I LIKED SOME OF THEM.</i>

482
00:34:50,656 --> 00:34:54,591
<i>THEY WERE NICE BOYS,</i>
<i>BUT...</i>

483
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,829
<i>I DIDN'T WANT</i>
<i>TO LEAVE MY MUM AND DAD.</i>

484
00:34:58,831 --> 00:35:00,864
<i>I WISH I HAD, SOMETIMES.</i>

485
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:04,134
Jane: <i>YOU KNOW WHEN YOU</i>
<i>WERE 19 AND THE WORLD</i>
<i>JUST FELT SO OPEN</i>

486
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:07,204
AND CAREFREE
AND FULL OF POSSIBILITY?

487
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,040
HE REMINDED ME OF THAT.

488
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,809
OF THAT TIME.

489
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:14,978
YOU WERE 19 WHEN WE MET.
YEAH.

490
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:17,614
I WOULDN'T HAVE
DESCRIBED YOU AS
CAREFREE BACK THEN.

491
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:18,748
NOT AT ALL.

492
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:21,051
WELL, I FELT NOSTALGIA...

493
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:22,586
OR SOMETHING... FOR YOUTH.

494
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:24,888
YOU'RE NOT OLD, JANE.

495
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,591
WE RAN OUT ON THE BILL.

496
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:30,760
YOU JUST RAN--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU RAN OUT ON A BILL?

497
00:35:30,762 --> 00:35:33,130
PERHAPS I'M NOT
EXPLAINING IT WELL.
IT WAS...

498
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:36,066
IT WAS FUN.

499
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,068
IT WAS JUST FUN.

500
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,878
( church bells toll )

501
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,046
HOW WAS WORK?

502
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,883
THE CONDUCTOR IS
ACTUALLY A DESCENDANT

503
00:35:52,885 --> 00:35:55,152
OF WALTER LEGGE,
WHICH IS FASCINATING.

504
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:57,053
THE THREE OF US
SHOULD PLAN A DINNER
BEFORE WE LEAVE.

505
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,156
I'D LIKE THAT.

506
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,827
JANE?

507
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:08,031
OH, MY GOD. IT'S--

508
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,933
THIS IS CALEB.

509
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,868
HI.
LEONARD. WE WERE
JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU.

510
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,070
WE WERE. THAT'S SO WEIRD.

511
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:16,840
SIT. PLEASE,
SIT DOWN. JOIN US.

512
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:17,908
WELL--

513
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:22,112
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES
OF THAT?
I KNOW, RIGHT?

514
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,151
I'VE ACTUALLY GOT
TO GET BACK PRETTY SOON.

515
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:30,053
THAT'S OKAY. I ALREADY ATE,

516
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:32,255
SO I'LL JUST GRAB
A COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

517
00:36:40,932 --> 00:36:43,166
CAN I HAVE THE CHECK,
PLEASE?

518
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:46,002
( orders coffee
in Italian )

519
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:50,974
OH, NO, THANK YOU.

520
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:52,175
JANE?

521
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,112
JANE?

522
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,081
YOU DON'T SMOKE.

523
00:36:58,083 --> 00:37:00,083
YES, I DO.

524
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:02,219
SOMETIMES, AT PARTIES.

525
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:04,854
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

526
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:06,823
WELL, I DON'T
DO IT A LOT.

527
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:18,101
ITALIAN FOOD'S
SO OVERRATED.

528
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:20,003
I LOVE IT.

529
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:21,705
THERE'S NO VARIETY.

530
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:23,173
ENGLISH FOOD,
ON THE OTHER HAND--

531
00:37:23,175 --> 00:37:25,108
SAY WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT IT,

532
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,711
THERE'S NOTHING
LIKE A GOOD STEAK
AND KIDNEY PIE.

533
00:37:27,713 --> 00:37:30,780
I WENT TO THIS
PARTY THE OTHER DAY,
IN THIS VILLA

534
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:33,717
OWNED BY THIS
OLD DRUNK EX-PAT,

535
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,720
AND THEY HAD, LIKE,
A PRIVATE CHEF
AND EVERYTHING...

536
00:37:36,722 --> 00:37:39,990
AND THEY WERE
SERVING THIS, LIKE,
LOAF OF MEAT

537
00:37:39,992 --> 00:37:42,859
COVERED IN SAUCE WITH
ALL THESE OTHER LOAVES.

538
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:45,195
THIS GIRL CAME OVER TO ME
AND SAID IT WAS CAT.

539
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:47,030
NO!
NO JOKE.

540
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:51,034
LIKE A ROASTED MOMMY CAT
AND HER KITTENS.

541
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:52,869
THAT IS DISGUSTING.

542
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,971
TRUE STORY.

543
00:37:54,973 --> 00:37:58,775
( both chuckle )

544
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:02,879
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL LEONARD ONE OF
YOUR VIOLA JOKES?

545
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:06,283
COME ON.

546
00:38:06,285 --> 00:38:08,752
YOU SOUND
LIKE MY AUNT.

547
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:11,421
COME ON.
LET'S HEAR ONE.

548
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:16,826
I HAVE ONE.

549
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,767
WHAT IS THE DEFINITION
OF "PERFECT PITCH"?

550
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:25,101
WHAT?

551
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,272
WHEN YOU THROW A VIOLA
INTO THE DUMPSTER

552
00:38:29,274 --> 00:38:31,074
WITHOUT HITTING THE RIM.

553
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,777
( snickering )

554
00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:35,312
YOU DIDN'T
JUST MAKE THAT UP.
I DID.

555
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:39,015
WELL, I'M IMPRESSED
AND I'M STEALING IT.

556
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:41,951
YOU CAN PRETTY
MUCH MAKE THAT JOKE
ABOUT ANY INSTRUMENT.

557
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:47,190
DO YOU PLAY
ANYTHING, CALEB?

558
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:49,392
THIS AND THAT, YOU KNOW.

559
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,929
SHALL WE?

560
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,899
WHAT? TIME TO GO,
ALREADY?

561
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:58,134
YEAH, I'VE GOT TO GET
BACK TO WORK.

562
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:09,312
Leonard: SO, WHAT'S NEXT
ON YOUR AGENDA, CALEB?

563
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:12,115
Caleb: UM,
I'M THINKING TIBET.

564
00:39:12,117 --> 00:39:14,117
Jane: OH, TIBET?
REALLY?

565
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:15,952
YEAH, THERE'S
THIS THING CALLED
THE SHOTON FESTIVAL...

566
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,954
AT THE END OF THE SUMMER.
I'VE HEARD ABOUT THAT.

567
00:39:17,956 --> 00:39:20,023
THAT'S WHERE
THE BUDDHIST MONKS

568
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:22,826
UNROLL ALL THE TAPESTRIES
ON THE HILL, RIGHT?

569
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:24,361
THE MONKS, THE MONKS,
THE MONKS.

570
00:39:24,363 --> 00:39:26,396
IT'S SO PRETTY.

571
00:39:26,398 --> 00:39:28,231
HOW DO YOU
SUPPORT YOURSELF?

572
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:30,433
OH, BIT OF THIS,
BIT OF THAT.

573
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,374
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

574
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:40,877
I'LL WALK YOU.
DOES ANYBODY HAVE
A PEN? YOU GOT A PEN?

575
00:39:40,879 --> 00:39:42,212
YEAH, I HAVE A PEN.

576
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,086
OKAY.

577
00:39:54,458 --> 00:39:57,260
I HAVE A PIECE OF PAPER.

578
00:39:57,262 --> 00:39:59,229
YOU GUYS SHOULD DEFINITELY
COME OVER TO THE ISLAND.

579
00:39:59,231 --> 00:40:01,431
I'LL TAKE YOU
SOMEWHERE FUN,
YOU KNOW.

580
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:03,967
DON'T KNOCK ON
THE FRONT DOOR.
COME AROUND THE SIDE.

581
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:06,136
90 REGINA...

582
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:08,304
ISCHIA.

583
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:11,007
HERE YOU GO.

584
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,876
THANK YOU.

585
00:40:12,878 --> 00:40:14,444
AND THANKS AGAIN
FOR YESTERDAY.

586
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,113
OH, NO PROBLEM.

587
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:18,448
OKAY.

588
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,926
HOW STONED <i>ARE</i> YOU?

589
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:32,362
COME ON, LEONARD.
IT WAS JUST ONE PUFF.
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

590
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,367
SO YOU'RE SAYING
YOU SMOKE BACK AT HOME?

591
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,002
OCCASIONALLY.

592
00:40:39,004 --> 00:40:41,104
HEY, CAN WE DO
SOMETHING FUN TONIGHT?

593
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:43,239
SURE.

594
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:47,444
I'M FINE FROM HERE.

595
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,179
OKAY.
SEE YOU AFTER WORK.

596
00:40:49,181 --> 00:40:50,980
YEP. I'LL BE WAITING.

597
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:24,047
HEY.
OH, GOD,
YOU SCARED ME.

598
00:41:24,049 --> 00:41:26,049
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

599
00:41:26,051 --> 00:41:28,151
MAYBE. IS THAT WEIRD?

600
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,320
YEAH.

601
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,596
I COULDN'T SLEEP
LAST NIGHT.

602
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:45,101
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WERE STAYING
NEAR THE PORT,

603
00:41:45,103 --> 00:41:47,537
SO I GOT THE FIRST
FERRY THIS MORNING.

604
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:49,506
I CAME
LOOKING FOR YOU.

605
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,309
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FOUND YOU.

606
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:37,053
What are we doing?

607
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:40,256
I think we're making out.

608
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,292
You're so sexy.

609
00:42:42,294 --> 00:42:44,227
And beautiful.

610
00:43:14,058 --> 00:43:15,258
I CAN'T.
I CAN'T DO THIS.

611
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,527
WHY? WHY?
I CAN'T DO THIS.

612
00:43:17,529 --> 00:43:18,728
WHY?

613
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,473
DO YOU DO THIS A LOT?
WHAT?

614
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:33,276
DO YOU DO THIS A LOT?
WHAT?

615
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:36,412
DO YOU SEDUCE WOMEN?
IS THIS WHAT YOU DO?

616
00:43:37,581 --> 00:43:39,649
YOU NEED TO BE
LESS SERIOUS.

617
00:43:45,589 --> 00:43:47,423
DON'T FOLLOW ME.

618
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,357
Grandmother:
<i>THERE WAS ONE BOY</i>
<i>FROM BELGIUM.</i>

619
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,193
<i>HE WAS LOVELY.</i>

620
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,661
<i>HE HAD A MUSTACHE.</i>

621
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:01,397
<i>( laughing )</i>
<i>MY MOTHER HATED</i>
<i>MUSTACHES.</i>

622
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,435
<i>BUT HE WAS SHIPPED OFF.</i>

623
00:45:05,437 --> 00:45:07,503
<i>I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.</i>

624
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,476
<i>ANYWAYS, I MET</i>
<i>YOUR GRANDFATHER</i>
<i>NOT LONG AFTER,</i>

625
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:16,179
<i>AND WE GOT MARRIED.</i>

626
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,581
Jane: <i>WAS IT LOVE AT</i>
<i>FIRST SIGHT WITH GRANDPA?</i>

627
00:45:18,583 --> 00:45:20,750
<i>LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT?</i>

628
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:23,186
<i>STOP THAT THING. WE'RE--</i>

629
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:24,387
LEONARD.

630
00:45:25,589 --> 00:45:27,457
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

631
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:36,332
WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THAT?

632
00:45:36,334 --> 00:45:37,800
I JUST MISSED MY HUSBAND.

633
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:45,475
JANE, I'M SORRY,
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

634
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:48,411
A HELL OF A REST
OF MY DAY.

635
00:45:51,215 --> 00:45:53,416
SORRY, DARLING.

636
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:55,485
HEY, DO YOU STILL
WANT TO DO SOMETHING
FUN TONIGHT?

637
00:45:55,487 --> 00:45:57,620
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.
I BROUGHT SOME DINNER.

638
00:45:57,622 --> 00:46:01,758
THOUGHT WE'D
JUST STAY IN HERE.
THE TWO OF US.

639
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,760
I'VE JUST GOT TO
WORK THIS THING OUT
BEFORE TOMORROW.

640
00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,361
OKAY.
OKAY.

641
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:07,230
I'M SORRY.

642
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:08,431
It's okay.

643
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:34,857
( viola playing )

644
00:46:58,282 --> 00:46:59,482
Leonard.

645
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,352
Leonard.

646
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,655
Can we talk?

647
00:47:34,618 --> 00:47:36,686
SAY CHEESE.
CHEESE.

648
00:47:39,623 --> 00:47:42,592
YOU SHOULD KIND OF
BE IN THE MIDDLE.

649
00:47:42,594 --> 00:47:44,427
NEVER MIND.

650
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:47,430
HOLD ON A SECOND.

651
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,805
LOOK AT THAT.

652
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,508
THAT'S WHAT
OUR LIVING ROOM
IS MISSING.

653
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:13,689
( camera beeps,
then clicks )

654
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,760
WHAT DID YOU DO?
I PUT MY HAND
OVER MY MOUTH.

655
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:19,896
YOU DID?
WHAT DID YOU DO?

656
00:48:19,898 --> 00:48:22,498
JUST WAVED.
( chuckles softly )

657
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:50,026
( voices arguing )

658
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,603
( arguing in Italian )

659
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:54,657
( passionate gasping )

660
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:56,625
LEONARD?

661
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,800
DO YOU HAVE ANY FANTASIES?

662
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:07,803
WHAT?

663
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:10,806
WHAT?

664
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:14,744
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT?

665
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:22,752
JUST AS YOU ARE, JANE.
JUST AS YOU ARE.

666
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:24,687
YOU'RE ALL I NEED.

667
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:44,033
( knocking on door )

668
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:51,640
OH!

669
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:52,842
HI.

670
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:55,711
DID I WAKE YOU?

671
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,113
NO.

672
00:51:58,982 --> 00:52:01,917
I THINK I NEED
TO BE LESS SERIOUS.

673
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,989
YEAH. LET ME
PUT MY PANTS ON.

674
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:10,126
MM-KAY.

675
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:42,905
LEONARD THOUGHT
YOU WERE LYING...

676
00:55:42,907 --> 00:55:45,007
ABOUT THOSE CATS.

677
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:46,275
HE SAID THAT?

678
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,281
WERE YOU?
THEY WERE DELICIOUS.

679
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,167
YOU MAKE ME FEEL NERVOUS.

680
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,172
YOU MAKE ME FEEL CALM.

681
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,065
YOU WANT A DRINK?

682
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:03,152
( muffled footfalls )

683
00:57:03,154 --> 00:57:04,887
IS THAT HIM?

684
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:07,222
YEAH, HE JUST SHUFFLES
AROUND ALL NIGHT.

685
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,960
MUST BE LONELY.

686
00:58:51,561 --> 00:58:56,265
Voices on Tape: <i>♪ AGAIN</i>

I DIDN'T SLEEP
AT ALL LAST NIGHT.
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

698
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,111
I WAS WALKING.

699
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,081
ALL NIGHT?

700
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,183
I'VE BEEN THINKING.

701
00:59:48,185 --> 00:59:50,485
YOU LEFT YOUR PHONE HERE.
I HAD TO PLUG IT IN.

702
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,122
WE NEED TO TALK, LEONARD.

703
00:59:54,124 --> 00:59:55,591
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

704
00:59:58,628 --> 01:00:01,229
CAN YOU BE LATE?
NO. I CAN'T BE LATE.

705
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,336
LEONARD--
JANE, WHATEVER YOU HAVE
TO SAY TO ME,

706
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:11,373
I WANNA HEAR IT.
BUT I'VE COMMITTED MYSELF.

707
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:14,343
PEOPLE ARE DEPENDING ON ME.
I HAVE TO GO TO WORK.

708
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,580
OKAY.

709
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:53,215
Grandmother:
<i>IF IT WASN'T THE WAR,</i>

710
01:00:53,217 --> 01:00:56,485
<i>IT WOULD'VE BEEN</i>
<i>SOMETHING ELSE.</i>

711
01:00:56,487 --> 01:00:59,388
<i>THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING</i>
<i>ELSE, ISN'T THERE?</i>

712
01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,457
<i>BUT THAT'S THE THING.</i>
<i>THAT'S THE THING</i>
<i>ABOUT STRUGGLE.</i>

713
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:17,272
I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME TEA.
DO YOU WANT SOME?

714
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:18,607
I'M ALL RIGHT.

715
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,684
YOU GO OUT LIKE THAT AGAIN,
JUST TELL ME. I WORRY.

716
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,620
OKAY.

717
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:36,525
I CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD.

718
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:54,309
DO YOU THINK EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
ACTUALLY DOES US ANY GOOD?

719
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:56,778
IN THE LONG RUN?

720
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:02,684
OR DO WE JUST MAKE OUT
"STRUGGLE" TO BE
SOMETHING MEANINGFUL

721
01:02:02,686 --> 01:02:05,520
BECAUSE THAT'S ALL
MOST OF US HAVE?

722
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,469
I TELL YOU, NEXT TIME
WE COME TO ITALY...

723
01:02:20,471 --> 01:02:22,571
WE NEED TO GET
A PROPER KITCHEN.

724
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:33,281
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT ME TO SAY, JANE.

725
01:02:53,503 --> 01:02:56,238
<i>IF ONE LITTLE THING</i>
<i>HAD CHANGED IN MY</i>
<i>GRANDMOTHER'S LIFE,</i>

726
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:57,706
I MIGHT NOT BE HERE.

727
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:07,315
SOMETIMES I WORRY
I'M NOT HONORING HER.

728
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:10,852
WITH THE BOOK?

729
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,457
NO, WITH MY LIFE.

730
01:03:20,396 --> 01:03:22,798
THIS IS IT, YOU KNOW.

731
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,733
IT ENDS WITH ME.

732
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,673
Grandmother:
<i>IN THE HARVEST TIME</i>
<i>WE ALL WENT TO THE FIELD</i>

733
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:33,942
<i>WHERE THEY WERE</i>
<i>CUTTING THE CORN.</i>

734
01:03:36,279 --> 01:03:37,846
<i>EVERYONE</i>
<i>WAS CHASING RABBITS,</i>

735
01:03:37,848 --> 01:03:41,550
<i>AND THEN WE HAD OUR TEA</i>
<i>IN THE HARVEST FIELDS.</i>

736
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,389
<i>THE HORSES.</i>

737
01:03:47,391 --> 01:03:48,824
YEAH?
MM-HMM.

738
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,332
<i>THE HORSES BACK THEN,</i>
<i>THEY WERE KEPT BEAUTIFULLY.</i>

739
01:03:57,334 --> 01:03:58,867
<i>DAD USED TO DRESS THEM</i>
<i>ALL UP--</i>

740
01:03:58,869 --> 01:04:03,305
<i>BRASS THINGS AND--</i>
<i>AND LITTLE HORSESHOES.</i>

741
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:04,840
<i>HE'D PUT BRAIDS ON THEM.</i>

742
01:04:04,842 --> 01:04:07,709
<i>( gasps )</i>
<i>THEY USED TO BE GORGEOUS.</i>

743
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:10,545
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS
FOR TOMORROW?

744
01:04:10,547 --> 01:04:13,348
Grandmother :
<i>THERE WAS ONE,</i>

745
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,851
<i>DUKE.</i>
<i>HE WAS A CLYDESDALE</i>

746
01:04:15,853 --> 01:04:18,420
<i>I USED TO RIDE</i>
<i>DOWN TO THE MARSHES</i>

747
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:20,755
<i>EVERY NIGHT WHEN</i>
<i>HE FINISHED WORKING.</i>

748
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:26,828
<i>THEY WERE LOVELY DAYS,</i>
<i>REALLY.</i>

749
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,396
Caleb: GO!

750
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:35,871
Grandmother:
<i>THEY'RE GONE, FOR ME.</i>

751
01:04:35,873 --> 01:04:38,373
Leonard: <i>JANE?</i>

752
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,542
Grandmother:
<i>BUT NOT FOR YOU.</i>
<i>JANE.</i>

753
01:04:40,544 --> 01:04:42,744
<i>YOU KNOW, IT'S</i>
<i>DIFFERENT FOR YOU.</i>

754
01:04:42,746 --> 01:04:45,347
<i>IN SOME WAYS</i>
<i>IT'S EASIER.</i>

755
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:46,815
<i>YOU HAVEN'T GOT THE WAR.</i>

756
01:04:46,817 --> 01:04:49,618
<i>PEOPLE DON'T DIE AS MUCH</i>
<i>AS THEY DID BACK THEN,</i>

757
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:52,954
<i>BUT IN SOME WAYS</i>
<i>IT'S MORE DISJOINTED.</i>

758
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:58,460
<i>YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE</i>
<i>YOUR OWN LIFE,</i>

759
01:04:58,462 --> 01:05:01,630
<i>ONE THAT YOU LOVE,</i>
<i>AND YOU CAN'T BE</i>
<i>AFRAID OF THE...</i>

760
01:05:01,632 --> 01:05:03,431
<i>THE TIME.</i>

761
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,835
<i>TIME IS SHIFTABLE.</i>

762
01:05:15,778 --> 01:05:18,513
<i>THERE ARE MOMENTS</i>
<i>IN MY LIFE THAT</i>
<i>I WOULD TRADE</i>

763
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:22,617
<i>60 YEARS TO</i>
<i>HAVE BACK AGAIN.</i>
<i>THAT'S THE TRUTH.</i>

764
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:25,654
<i>YOU'LL KNOW THE TRUTH</i>
<i>WHEN YOU FIND IT.</i>

765
01:05:25,656 --> 01:05:27,889
<i>IT'LL COME TO</i>
<i>YOU LIKE SOMETHING</i>
<i>YOU'VE KNOWN BEFORE</i>

766
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:32,727
<i>RATHER THAN SOMETHING</i>
<i>YOU'RE LEARNING FOR</i>
<i>THE FIRST TIME.</i>

767
01:05:34,864 --> 01:05:36,665
OH, SORRY.
THAT'S OKAY.

768
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:39,768
AHH! BOLLOCKS!
WHAT IS IT?

769
01:05:39,770 --> 01:05:44,940
( Leonard groaning )
OHH, YOU FU...!

770
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:47,709
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

771
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,512
YOU OKAY?
YEAH. I STUBBED MY TOE.

772
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:53,982
IT'S BLEEDING.

773
01:05:53,984 --> 01:05:58,687
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE,
IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

774
01:05:58,689 --> 01:06:00,455
YOU FINISHED IN THERE?

775
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:01,790
YES.

776
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:02,991
FUCK!

Caleb: <i>I MET THESE BACKPACKERS</i>
<i>LAST NIGHT, FRANK AND ELSA.</i>

778
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:17,806
<i>SHE'S FRENCH, HE'S GERMAN.</i>

779

<i>THEY'RE GOING TO TIBET,</i>

780
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:21,943
<i>AND I'M GOING WITH THEM.</i>

781
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:25,914
<i>I WANT YOU TO COME WITH ME.</i>

782
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,913
HI.
HI.

783
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,715
HOW ARE YOU?

784
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,785
KNACKERED.

785
01:07:36,787 --> 01:07:38,920
LONG DAY?

786
01:07:38,922 --> 01:07:42,590
GOD, WHEN ARE THEY NOT?

787
01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:45,794
I DON'T THINK I'D JUMP
AT DOING ANOTHER
STINT LIKE THIS.

788
01:07:48,998 --> 01:07:51,032
HOW'S THE WRITING GOING?

789
01:07:52,568 --> 01:07:54,169
I'M FEELING INSPIRED.

790
01:07:57,807 --> 01:08:00,075
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

791
01:08:00,077 --> 01:08:03,611
I THINK I'VE FIGURED OUT
THE KEY TO FINISHING
THE PROJECT.

792
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:08,850
ARE YOU LISTENING?

793
01:08:10,653 --> 01:08:13,621
YOU FOUND THE KEY
TO FINISHING THIS PROJECT.

794
01:08:21,831 --> 01:08:23,898
THE WATER HERE
TASTES SO FUNNY.

795
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,971
HAVE YOU EVER CHEATED ON ME?

796
01:08:29,973 --> 01:08:31,639
OH, JANE.
HAVE YOU?

797
01:08:31,641 --> 01:08:33,174
CAN WE NOT?

798
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,044
HAVE YOU?

799
01:08:40,015 --> 01:08:41,783
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

800
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,986
WHY DID YOU TAKE SUCH
A LONG TIME TO ANSWER THAT?

801
01:08:44,988 --> 01:08:48,089
BECAUSE I'M SICK...

802
01:08:48,091 --> 01:08:49,958
OF WHAT, LEONARD?
OF IT BEING SO HARD?

803
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:53,761
YES.
TEDIOUS?

804
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:02,604
I HATE TALKING
ABOUT SEX WITH YOU.

805
01:09:02,606 --> 01:09:04,606
IS THAT WHAT
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?

806
01:09:04,608 --> 01:09:06,741
NORMAL PEOPLE
TALK ABOUT SEX, LEONARD.

807
01:09:06,743 --> 01:09:08,776
AND WE DON'T?

808
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:13,715
THERE'S JUST
HUGE VACANT LOTS
THAT WE DON'T DISCUSS.

809
01:09:13,717 --> 01:09:15,717
LIKE WHAT?

810
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:17,886
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO ASK ME?

811
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:19,888
WHY? IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

812
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,823
I JUST WANNA CONNECT.

813
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,961
SO YOU DON'T FEEL
THAT WE'RE CONNECTED.
DO YOU?

814
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,099
I LOVE YOU.

815
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,175
I GET IT, LEONARD.

816
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:42,043
I GET IT.

817
01:09:42,045 --> 01:09:45,046
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
THIS BIG, SERIOUS,
GRAVE THING FOR US.

818
01:09:45,048 --> 01:09:48,116
SEX HAS CONSEQUENCES,
LIFE AND DEATH,
MOSTLY DEATH.

819
01:09:48,118 --> 01:09:51,186
JANE, PLEASE.
LET ME GUESS. YOU DON'T
WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

820
01:09:51,188 --> 01:09:53,655
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT
I'M SAYING. YOU'RE JUST--

821
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:56,191
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE
CHILDREN, LEONARD?
OF COURSE I DID.

822
01:09:56,193 --> 01:10:00,762
NOT "DID." DO YOU WANT
TO HAVE CHILDREN?

823
01:10:00,764 --> 01:10:03,097
SO DID YOU, BUT...

824
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,901
SAY IT.

825
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:09,003
JANE.
SAY IT.

826
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:11,873
I CAN'T HAVE CHILDREN,
LEONARD.

827
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:15,677
I NEVER WILL.

828
01:10:15,679 --> 01:10:18,146
AND IF WE KEEP TRYING,
THEY KEEP DYING.

829
01:10:18,148 --> 01:10:21,115
PLEASE, JANE. PLEASE.
AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN.

830
01:10:22,985 --> 01:10:25,053
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

831
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:32,827
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
HOW DOES IT MAKE
YOU FEEL, LEONARD?

832
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:34,829
HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU <i>FEEL?</i>

833
01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:38,032
YOU WILL <i>NEVER</i> BE A <i>FATHER.</i>

834
01:10:38,034 --> 01:10:39,767
WE CAN ADOPT.

835
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:42,103
THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU WANT, IS IT?

836
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:45,039
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

837
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:47,875
HM?

838
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:52,013
'CAUSE I THINK ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.

839
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:53,982
THAT THE ONE THING
YOU ALWAYS WANTED,

840
01:10:53,984 --> 01:10:56,117
I WILL NEVER BE
ABLE TO GIVE YOU.

841
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,129
WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO, JANE?

842
01:11:08,131 --> 01:11:11,065
I JUST WANT TO
KNOW THAT THERE'S
A REASON... FOR IT ALL.

843
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:23,878
YOU'RE NOT CURIOUS
ABOUT ME, LEONARD.

844
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:26,314
NOT REALLY.

845
01:11:26,316 --> 01:11:28,983
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO KNOW?
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK.

846
01:11:28,985 --> 01:11:34,155
I FEEL AS IF YOU WANT
ME TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT.

847
01:11:34,157 --> 01:11:36,291
SOMEONE
THAT I'VE <i>NEVER</i> BEEN.

848
01:11:39,228 --> 01:11:42,330
I'M LEAVING YOU.

849
01:11:42,332 --> 01:11:44,399
I'VE BEEN
SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

850
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,005
SEEING?

851
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,174
CALEB.

852
01:11:53,176 --> 01:11:55,977
THAT KID?
YES.

853
01:11:55,979 --> 01:11:58,913
THAT KID, THAT CHILD,
THAT KID YOU'VE KNOWN
FOR TWO DAYS?

854
01:11:58,915 --> 01:12:02,183
IT'S BEEN LONGER THAN THAT.
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE JOKING.

855
01:12:02,185 --> 01:12:04,786
TIME IS SHIFTABLE.
I DON'T GET IT.

856
01:12:04,788 --> 01:12:07,055
LEONARD.
I DON'T GET IT.

857
01:12:07,057 --> 01:12:08,990
HE'S ASKED ME
TO TRAVEL WITH HIM.

858
01:12:08,992 --> 01:12:11,059
ARE YOU SLEEPING WITH HIM?

859
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:14,329
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

860
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,001
( glass shatters;
car horn honks outside )

861
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:23,204
I KEPT WAITING FOR YOU
TO SEE IT, TO SMELL IT,

862
01:12:23,206 --> 01:12:24,339
TO SENSE IT!

863
01:12:24,341 --> 01:12:27,008
SO, WHAT?
I FAILED YOUR TEST?

864
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:29,110
YOU DON'T SEE ME!

865
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:50,264
I'M SORRY.
FOR WHAT?

866
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,034
I'M SORRY.
FOR WHAT?

867
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:55,236
I SHOULDN'T
HAVE DONE THAT.
NO.

868
01:12:55,238 --> 01:12:57,105
LOSING MY TEMPER.
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.
YOU HAD EVERY RIGHT...

869
01:12:57,107 --> 01:12:59,107
...TO LOSE YOUR TEMPER.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

870
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:02,310
IF YOU THINK THAT
THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER,

871
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:05,847
THEN YOU SHOULD GO.
YOU SHOULD GO WITH HIM.

872
01:13:05,849 --> 01:13:07,382
YOU'VE BEEN
THROUGH A TERRIBLE...

873
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:09,150
TERRIBLE THING, JANE.
NO.

874
01:13:09,152 --> 01:13:11,386
THAT IS NOT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT.
OF COURSE IT IS.

875
01:13:11,388 --> 01:13:13,955
YOU DON'T LOVE ME
ANYMORE, LEONARD.

876
01:13:13,957 --> 01:13:17,058
YOU DON'T LOVE ME!
THAT'S-- THAT'S RUBBISH.

WE'LL GO HOME TOGETHER.

882
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,076
I WANT YOU TO DO
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO.

883
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,348
AND THEN COME BACK TO ME.
