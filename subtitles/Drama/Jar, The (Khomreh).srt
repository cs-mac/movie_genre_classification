1
00:01:18,376 --> 00:01:22,403
Örn. I'll get fired
if you don't get out of here.

2
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,916
Hold on.
Just give me a minute.

3
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:51,539
Sorry. I was applying
to the data protection committee.

4
00:01:51,609 --> 00:01:53,941
Now?

5
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:55,638
Yes.

6
00:01:56,414 --> 00:02:00,544
I think you'd be more useful here with her
and let the doctors do their jobs.

7
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:03,610
What are the doctors doing?

8
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:07,655
See you tomorrow.

9
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:10,125
I'll come in early tomorrow morning.

10
00:02:13,064 --> 00:02:14,998
Goodbye, Kola darling.

11
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:18,492
Try to get some rest.

12
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:35,981
Daddy, where's Mommy?

13
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:40,484
- she's gone home.
- For Christmas?

14
00:02:42,693 --> 00:02:45,457
No. We're saving Christmas
until you get back.

15
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:49,466
When will that be?

16
00:02:53,204 --> 00:02:55,536
Try to sleep, darling.

17
00:02:55,606 --> 00:03:00,543
But I can't close my eyes.

18
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:07,476
Shall I sing a lullaby for you?

19
00:03:07,552 --> 00:03:09,179
Yes.

20
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:19,696
Sleep my lovely little one...

21
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,776
JAR ClTY

22
00:04:49,854 --> 00:04:51,981
Where are you?

23
00:04:58,596 --> 00:05:01,292
Arnar, what are you doing?

24
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:31,751
Arnar.
What have you done?

25
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,263
Arnar, Arnar.

26
00:05:38,803 --> 00:05:41,499
The chief asked for you
to handle the case.

27
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:46,339
- Isn't he off work sick?
- No, not today.

28
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,207
It's in Northmarsh.

29
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,474
- Just round the corner?
- Yeah.

30
00:05:50,548 --> 00:05:55,076
Sigurdur Óli's already there. He's
watching out they don't touch anything.

31
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:58,053
They'd do better to watch out
for Sigurdur Óli.

32
00:06:05,329 --> 00:06:08,992
- Who found the body?
- some boys in the neighborhood.

33
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:14,162
What a shitty smell.

34
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:17,901
A typical Icelandic murder.
Messy and pointless.

35
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:21,536
And with no attempt
to conceal the evidence.

36
00:06:27,585 --> 00:06:31,817
- How long has he been lying here?
- About two days, I would say.

37
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:35,222
Smells more like two months.

38
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:42,894
"Holberg."

39
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,860
An unusual name.

40
00:07:18,402 --> 00:07:20,563
Excuse me.

41
00:07:20,638 --> 00:07:23,903
Excuse me.
Can I have a word?

42
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:30,273
- It's about the murder in the basement.
- I didn't know the man at all.

43
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:39,478
Regarding Holberg.

44
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:46,494
I only spoke to him a couple of times.
About the bloody stink in the basement.

45
00:07:46,564 --> 00:07:49,294
Has it been like that for long?

46
00:07:49,366 --> 00:07:53,769
It was worse in the summer.
The house is built on a marsh.

47
00:07:53,838 --> 00:07:56,272
Did you notice any visitors recently?

48
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,242
No, he kept to himself. I saw
a shady-looking character the other day.

49
00:08:00,311 --> 00:08:04,213
- Can you describe him?
- No. I was drunk.

50
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:06,408
- I have a plane to fly.
- Where to?

51
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:09,453
- Ever been to Stockholm?
- No.

52
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,646
Awful place.

53
00:09:10,347 --> 00:09:12,747
"Aude."

54
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:23,053
Good Lord, bring peace to the dead,
comfort to those who live.

55
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,674
Good morning.
Or maybe not so good.

56
00:10:11,742 --> 00:10:13,232
Erlendur?

57
00:10:20,584 --> 00:10:24,611
I think it's shot on a Holga,
an old Russian camera.

58
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:29,921
Aude was only four when she died.

59
00:10:33,864 --> 00:10:36,059
Has my daughter called?

60
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,632
No.

61
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:48,206
Holberg lived in Keflavik,
born in 1937.

62
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:51,680
He was a truck driver
for the past few years.

63
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,740
What about his family?

64
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,877
No family.
He had a sister who died young.

65
00:10:56,954 --> 00:10:59,184
- How old?
- six.

66
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:01,952
His flat looked like
he was a lonely old fart.

67
00:11:02,026 --> 00:11:05,689
- Destined to live alone.
- What?

68
00:11:07,898 --> 00:11:11,664
- Anything from Pathology or Forensics?
- No, not yet.

69
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:16,932
Did Holberg have any children?

70
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:19,032
Not according to the report.

71
00:11:20,911 --> 00:11:24,677
Don't you find it abnormal,
photographing a headstone?

72
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:27,148
There's nothing normal
about losing a child.

73
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:35,021
Dad.

74
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:45,628
- Hello, Eva.
- Hi, Dad.

75
00:11:45,703 --> 00:11:48,672
- I haven't got any money.
- Two hundred.

76
00:11:48,739 --> 00:11:50,900
That's not much. Give me 200.

77
00:11:50,974 --> 00:11:53,272
Are you ill?

78
00:11:53,344 --> 00:11:56,905
Eva. What's wrong?

79
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,005
Give me the money and I'll tell you.

80
00:12:00,584 --> 00:12:02,381
Did something happen?

81
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,182
OK, 100?

82
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:08,352
Don't tell me you're pregnant.

83
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,128
- How?
- What do you mean, how?

84
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:16,496
Do you want the details?

85
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:21,937
- I can't talk to you in this state.
- I don't know what happened. It just did.

86
00:12:22,005 --> 00:12:26,203
- Where are you living now?
- I'm between apartments.

87
00:12:26,276 --> 00:12:29,302
- Do you want to go clean?
- I can't. I've told you everything.

88
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,508
- You owe me 200. Give me the money.
- To get your baby drugged?

89
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:36,041
How can you call this a baby?
It isn't a fucking baby yet.

90
00:12:38,956 --> 00:12:41,220
Who's the father?

91
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,908
The idea for the database
is to gather genetic data

92
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,539
on the entire population of Iceland
and use the findings to create

93
00:13:04,615 --> 00:13:08,073
new medical cures,
to relieve suffering and prevent diseases.

94
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:13,021
But is it ethical to use
personal information this way?

95
00:13:13,090 --> 00:13:16,685
That's a difficult question,
but in many ways I think that

96
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,787
if there is any justification
for using personal information,

97
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:24,095
it must be to ease and treat diseases.

98
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:27,660
Data on genetic diseases
isn't necessarily personal.

99
00:13:27,738 --> 00:13:31,174
It is information on diseases
passed on between generations.

100
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:34,540
It's a social problem.

101
00:13:34,611 --> 00:13:35,873
Örn.

102
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:47,520
Örn, a letter just came
from the data protection committee.

103
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,490
Thanks.

104
00:14:35,072 --> 00:14:41,170
I'm positive there is no trace of it
on my side of the family.

105
00:14:41,245 --> 00:14:44,305
No one's even heard of this disease.

106
00:14:44,381 --> 00:14:45,973
What does your wife say?

107
00:14:46,049 --> 00:14:51,077
She doesn't think it matters.

108
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:54,248
Says it won't bring our daughter back.

109
00:14:56,193 --> 00:14:58,991
Talk to your mother.

110
00:15:00,564 --> 00:15:02,725
She refuses to discuss it.

111
00:15:07,871 --> 00:15:10,499
I'm off to the harbor.

112
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:20,710
I'm worried about your father.

113
00:15:20,784 --> 00:15:23,844
It's as if he can't face his retirement.

114
00:15:23,921 --> 00:15:29,120
He's restless around the house and hangs
around at the harbor day in, day out.

115
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:31,922
I wonder if he ever felt at ease at home.

116
00:16:05,362 --> 00:16:08,354
This is the only Aude

117
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:12,562
who died aged 4 in 1974.

118
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:16,265
It says here the cause of death
was a malignant brain tumor.

119
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,572
I looked up the mother.
Her name was Kolbrun.

120
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:22,544
She committed suicide.

121
00:16:22,613 --> 00:16:27,516
- What about the father?
- I couldn't find anything about the father.

122
00:16:27,584 --> 00:16:35,355
In such cases, that generally
means incest, rape or a foreigner.

123
00:16:36,393 --> 00:16:41,262
The only living relative is Elín,
Aude's aunt.

124
00:16:41,698 --> 00:16:44,462
Elín.
Can you find her address?

125
00:16:45,802 --> 00:16:48,600
Was there any friction
between him and other workers?

126
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,698
I don't think so.
He kept to himself.

127
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:55,541
- Did Holberg ever talk about his family?
- I don't think he had one.

128
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,398
You have to be joking.

129
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:24,406
Is that a goat?

130
00:17:24,474 --> 00:17:26,704
No, it's a sheep.

131
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,232
Hello?

132
00:18:58,301 --> 00:19:02,601
Elín? My name's Erlendur.
I called you this morning.

133
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:05,971
Would you please come to the door?

134
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,537
I need to talk to you about Kolbrun.

135
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:14,983
I don't want anything to do with the police
after what you did to her.

136
00:19:15,051 --> 00:19:17,144
What did we do to her?

137
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,211
Leave me alone.

138
00:20:16,546 --> 00:20:19,538
Aude, Kolbrun's daughter Arnar.

139
00:20:21,985 --> 00:20:25,011
"Preserve my life
from fear of the enemy."

140
00:20:25,088 --> 00:20:28,251
Leave her alone.
Leave her alone.

141
00:20:28,692 --> 00:20:30,990
Where did you get that photo?

142
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,723
From Holberg's basement.
Did you know him?

143
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:37,255
- I hope he rots in hell.
- It looks like he will.

144
00:20:38,869 --> 00:20:41,133
Is Holberg Aude's father?

145
00:20:41,204 --> 00:20:42,364
Ask Rúnar Arnar.

146
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,703
- Rúnar?
- That sleazy cop.

147
00:20:44,774 --> 00:20:46,935
Sergeant Rúnar Gislason?

148
00:20:47,944 --> 00:20:49,536
Do you know that scum?

149
00:20:49,613 --> 00:20:52,081
He was the local policeman.

150
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:55,606
Lived here the last I knew.

151
00:20:55,685 --> 00:20:57,619
What did we do to her?

152
00:20:57,687 --> 00:21:02,090
Ask sergeant Rúnar, if he's still alive.
That piece of filth.

153
00:21:46,937 --> 00:21:50,236
Sergeant Rúnar.
How come Elín won't talk to me?

154
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:52,605
How the hell should I know?

155
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:56,612
I'm investigating the murder
of a man called Holberg.

156
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,807
What the hell
has that got to do with me?

157
00:21:58,882 --> 00:22:01,248
Fuck off, or I'll call the police.

158
00:22:01,318 --> 00:22:05,379
I am the police.
Perhaps you've forgotten that, too?

159
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:09,448
Tell me about Kolbrun,
Elín's sister.

160
00:22:11,661 --> 00:22:14,892
What did we do to her?

161
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:18,059
She was a whore.

162
00:22:18,134 --> 00:22:20,193
Accused the man of rape.

163
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:24,798
It was no fucking rape.
They said she was hitting on all of them.

164
00:22:24,874 --> 00:22:27,934
All ofthem?

165
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:30,479
Yes, the whole trio.

166
00:22:30,547 --> 00:22:32,071
- The trio?
- Yes.

167
00:22:32,148 --> 00:22:34,639
- What men are you talking about?
- You know.

168
00:22:34,718 --> 00:22:37,209
So you just sent her back home?

169
00:22:37,287 --> 00:22:42,452
I was simply showing her
what to expect if she pressed charges.

170
00:22:42,525 --> 00:22:44,459
Is that what police should be doing?

171
00:22:44,527 --> 00:22:47,553
She'd have been laughed
right out of court.

172
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:52,397
They should have fired you years ago,
you lousy piece of shit.

173
00:22:56,773 --> 00:22:59,264
The sergeant told her
to forget about it,

174
00:22:59,342 --> 00:23:05,042
then hid the blood-stained panties,
the only evidence.

175
00:23:05,115 --> 00:23:09,518
- Did Holberg know he was Aude's father?
- He flatly denied it.

176
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:12,612
- His mates testified against Kolbrun.
- What mates?

177
00:23:12,689 --> 00:23:16,682
Gretar and Ellidi.
Scumbags from Keflavik.

178
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,694
Ellidi?

179
00:23:18,762 --> 00:23:21,128
They told everyone she was a whore.

180
00:23:21,197 --> 00:23:24,655
Said she sold herself
to the Americans at the base

181
00:23:24,734 --> 00:23:28,067
and that she wasn't too good
for an Icelander.

182
00:23:30,874 --> 00:23:33,843
Kolbrun didn't leave the house for months.

183
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,440
Then she committed suicide.

184
00:23:39,849 --> 00:23:41,840
Do you have children?

185
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:45,553
Yes.

186
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:49,123
There's nothing as terrible
as losing a child.

187
00:24:19,155 --> 00:24:20,315
- Hi.
- Hello.

188
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,723
- The usual?
- Yeah. I'll have a sheep head.

189
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:45,644
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

190
00:25:15,912 --> 00:25:17,174
Eva.

191
00:25:20,216 --> 00:25:21,444
Eva.

192
00:26:15,705 --> 00:26:18,139
"Preserve my life from fear..."

193
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:46,735
"Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer."

194
00:26:48,538 --> 00:26:51,905
"Preserve my life
from fear of the enemy."

195
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,908
"Hide me from the secret counsel
of the wicked,"

196
00:26:57,981 --> 00:27:01,439
"from the insurrection
of the workers of iniquity"

197
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:07,446
"who bend their bows
to shoot bitter words"

198
00:27:07,523 --> 00:27:11,391
"that they may shoot in secret
at the perfect."

199
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,968
"They search out iniquities."

200
00:27:20,036 --> 00:27:23,836
"They encourage themselves
in an evil matter."

201
00:27:23,906 --> 00:27:26,397
"They commune of laying snares privily."

202
00:28:37,947 --> 00:28:40,177
I've made a decision.

203
00:28:41,317 --> 00:28:43,808
I'm going to make you a grandfather.

204
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:46,582
Grandpa Erlendur.

205
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:53,858
Thanks.

206
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:01,267
Can I stay with you

207
00:29:03,239 --> 00:29:06,106
until I find myself a new place?

208
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,914
Can I stay?

209
00:29:30,433 --> 00:29:33,095
As long as you want.
You know that.

210
00:30:22,318 --> 00:30:24,878
Smuggling of liquor and narcotics,

211
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:28,754
insurance fraud, manslaughter.

212
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:32,420
He sank a fishing boat.
Set fire to it.

213
00:30:32,495 --> 00:30:33,587
Three survived.

214
00:30:33,663 --> 00:30:37,326
The fourth was locked in the engine room
and went down with the boat.

215
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,233
Anything there
about assaulting a young man

216
00:30:40,303 --> 00:30:43,898
and cutting up his face
with a broken bottle?

217
00:30:43,973 --> 00:30:46,305
Do you know this guy?

218
00:30:47,543 --> 00:30:51,411
Ellidi is one of the most
notorious maniacs in Iceland.

219
00:30:51,481 --> 00:30:56,248
The trio. Drug addicts and scum
fucking everywhere.

220
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:00,688
Would you mind
putting out that cigarette?

221
00:31:00,756 --> 00:31:03,350
You're killing me with your smoking.

222
00:31:03,426 --> 00:31:06,452
You haven't stopped
Since we left town.

223
00:31:06,529 --> 00:31:08,827
Stop whining like a sissy.

224
00:31:31,754 --> 00:31:34,814
Ellidi just came out of solitary.
I'd treat him carefully.

225
00:31:34,891 --> 00:31:36,449
What was he in solitary for?

226
00:31:36,526 --> 00:31:39,461
He didn't show up in time
after a weekend leave.

227
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,623
Are you saying Ellidi was out
when Holberg was murdered?

228
00:31:42,698 --> 00:31:45,724
I suppose so. They brought him
back here two days ago.

229
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:49,293
What's going on? I had no information
about that. Why weren't we told?

230
00:31:49,372 --> 00:31:52,603
The yellow press has been
all over us about prison conditions.

231
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:56,133
We're not giving out
any unnecessary information.

232
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:57,804
Unnecessary?

233
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,610
This means that Ellidi
is a murder suspect.

234
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:04,551
It's not my responsibility.
I wasn't even on duty.

235
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,783
I'll be calm.

236
00:32:41,891 --> 00:32:44,052
Holberg was found murdered.

237
00:32:47,863 --> 00:32:52,562
- Holberg was murdered last weekend.
- I'm not talking to you while they're in here.

238
00:32:52,635 --> 00:32:55,365
What can you tell us
about your friend Holberg?

239
00:32:55,438 --> 00:32:57,303
Send them out.

240
00:33:00,443 --> 00:33:02,604
It's all right.

241
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:09,484
Where were you saturday night?

242
00:33:09,552 --> 00:33:12,919
- How is she doing down there?
- she?

243
00:33:12,989 --> 00:33:15,583
- Your cunt.
- Cut it out.

244
00:33:15,658 --> 00:33:18,491
Howwas he killed?

245
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,825
A blow to the head Arnar.

246
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:23,831
- With a hammer?
- No, with an ashtray.

247
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:27,258
An ashtray.

248
00:33:29,338 --> 00:33:31,670
What became of Gretar?

249
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:37,344
Gretar?

250
00:33:39,148 --> 00:33:42,345
Your friend and Holberg's.

251
00:33:45,488 --> 00:33:47,422
Why are you asking about Gretar?

252
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,984
- Gretar disappeared in the early '70s.
- What should I know about it?

253
00:33:52,061 --> 00:33:55,792
Holberg raped a woman
a few years before Gretar disappeared.

254
00:33:55,865 --> 00:33:58,834
That was no fucking rape.

255
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,892
Where were you last weekend?

256
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:03,703
- Getting nice and wet?
- Why cover up for Holberg?

257
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:05,934
- How are your panties?
- Cut the crap.

258
00:34:06,008 --> 00:34:08,602
He asked her what kind of panties
She was wearing.

259
00:34:08,678 --> 00:34:12,808
- How her husband liked fucking her.
- Her husband?

260
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:14,873
What husband?

261
00:34:16,285 --> 00:34:18,515
- What do I get out of this?
- Nothing.

262
00:34:18,587 --> 00:34:20,919
Except talking dirty to us.

263
00:34:24,326 --> 00:34:30,265
I want smokes, a TV in my cell
and a whore - one a month.

264
00:34:31,033 --> 00:34:33,763
His daughter, for example.

265
00:34:33,836 --> 00:34:38,535
They say Eva's pussy
is as pink as a pig's.

266
00:34:38,607 --> 00:34:40,598
Cheapest fuck in town.

267
00:34:53,789 --> 00:34:56,314
What woman were you talking about?

268
00:34:56,392 --> 00:34:59,589
What other woman
were you talking about?

269
00:35:00,196 --> 00:35:03,427
That fucking stupid moron.
Is he playing games with us?

270
00:35:03,499 --> 00:35:07,697
Or does he know about another woman
that Holberg raped?

271
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,761
Do you think it's broken?

272
00:35:11,474 --> 00:35:13,408
Don't be a pussy.

273
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,579
Erlendur,

Ellidi wants to talk to you.

274
00:35:39,068 --> 00:35:42,469
I'll tell you what I know,

275
00:35:42,538 --> 00:35:45,336
if you just get me out of here.

276
00:35:45,407 --> 00:35:48,740
Solitary is driving me crazy.

277
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,642
They treat me like a beast.

278
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:53,682
Who do you think you are?
Nelson Mandela?

279
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:57,951
You're the worst kind of a moron
I've ever come across.

280
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,682
I hope they keep you locked up forever.

281
00:36:01,056 --> 00:36:05,550
I'll tell you everything you want to know
if you just get me out of here.

282
00:36:05,628 --> 00:36:08,358
Why did you testify against Kolbrun?

283
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:11,456
I don't know what woman
you're talking about.

284
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:14,503
Who said I testified against this Kolbrun?

285
00:36:17,373 --> 00:36:18,499
Sergeant Rúnar.

286
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,002
I'll kill that jerk when I get out of here.

287
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:25,638
If you don't know Kolbrun,
then what woman were you talking about?

288
00:36:25,714 --> 00:36:27,875
Will you help me get out?

289
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:31,444
I'll see what I can do.

290
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,421
I can't remember her name,

291
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:37,584
but she lived in Grindavík.

292
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:40,322
She was about the same age
as Holberg.

293
00:36:40,396 --> 00:36:44,162
Gretar was in on it.
He took the photos.

294
00:36:44,233 --> 00:36:47,100
- What photos?
- I've told you all I know.

295
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,967
What happened to Gretar?

296
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:52,303
Ask sergeant Rúnar Arnar.

297
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:53,568
Why him?

298
00:37:00,282 --> 00:37:05,117
You promised to help me get out.

299
00:37:05,187 --> 00:37:09,089
And you promised your mother
you'd always be a good boy.

300
00:37:12,061 --> 00:37:14,928
You think he's misleading us
with this other woman?

301
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:18,160
He's not that clever.
We caught him off guard.

302
00:37:20,502 --> 00:37:24,336
How on earth are you going to find
this other woman?

303
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:26,931
Who said I was going to do it?

304
00:37:29,778 --> 00:37:31,746
- Erlendur, my friend.
- My friend?

305
00:37:31,814 --> 00:37:36,342
I'm having trouble breathing. Would you
mind putting that cigarette out?

306
00:37:36,418 --> 00:37:39,410
Just open the window.

307
00:37:55,804 --> 00:37:57,635
Eva.

308
00:37:58,540 --> 00:37:59,700
Eva.

309
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,130
Hi.

310
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,578
I went out to buy carrots.

311
00:38:36,645 --> 00:38:40,513
- Who taught you to make meat soup?
- Mom.

312
00:38:40,582 --> 00:38:45,952
Once when she wasn't talking too badly
about you, she told me it was your favorite

313
00:38:46,021 --> 00:38:49,047
and that you were a loser.

314
00:38:52,461 --> 00:38:55,726
Have you found the killer yet?

315
00:38:55,798 --> 00:38:59,700
- Ellidi sends his regards.
- Ellidi?

316
00:38:59,768 --> 00:39:01,963
Isn't he in prison?

317
00:39:08,277 --> 00:39:10,973
The scum I deal with
Sometime mention your name.

318
00:39:11,046 --> 00:39:13,708
It's their way of getting at me.

319
00:39:14,216 --> 00:39:16,047
Does it work?

320
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:28,093
How do you know Ellidi?

321
00:39:28,163 --> 00:39:30,893
I don't know him.

322
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:40,133
Has it ever crossed your mind
that they all know that I'm your daughter?

323
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:42,507
I get bugged about that, too.

324
00:40:03,732 --> 00:40:10,137
I'm Erlendur,

a police investigator.

325
00:40:10,205 --> 00:40:13,231
I'm blind, not deaf.

326
00:40:14,443 --> 00:40:16,775
Sorry.

327
00:40:16,845 --> 00:40:20,713
I wanted to have a word with you
about your son Gretar.

328
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,677
Have you found him, then?

329
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:30,782
No, but a friend of his was found
murdered recently. Holberg.

330
00:40:30,859 --> 00:40:33,054
I wouldn't know about that.

331
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,298
Really?

332
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:40,699
Was he bumped off?

333
00:40:41,937 --> 00:40:45,236
The last I saw of my son Gretar

334
00:40:45,307 --> 00:40:49,835
was when he came to my house

335
00:40:49,912 --> 00:40:54,940
in the summer of 1974.

336
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:59,078
He stole money from my purse.

337
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:03,584
Then he disappeared himself.
Like he'd been stolen.

338
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:10,590
Why have you got a picture
of JFK above your bed?

339
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:15,433
I always had a soft spot for him,
you know.

340
00:41:16,872 --> 00:41:18,931
Did you know
Gretar took photographs?

341
00:41:19,007 --> 00:41:23,774
Yes.
He was always taking those photos.

342
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:28,073
He told me once

343
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,243
that photos were...

344
00:41:34,823 --> 00:41:37,348
the mirrors of time.

345
00:41:37,426 --> 00:41:40,725
But I didn't have a clue
what he was talking about.

346
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:42,696
No.

347
00:41:42,764 --> 00:41:46,222
Do you think you'll find my boy?

348
00:41:49,138 --> 00:41:52,665
I never knewwhat Gretar was up to.

349
00:41:52,741 --> 00:41:55,141
I told him that at the time.

350
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,043
- Him?
- sergeant Rúnar.

351
00:41:58,113 --> 00:42:01,276
He led the investigation
of Gretar's disappearance.

352
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,374
Rúnar Gislason?

353
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:07,514
And he seemed to be in quite a hurry
to close the case.

354
00:42:08,891 --> 00:42:12,054
- There was something rotten in the air.
- What?

355
00:42:12,127 --> 00:42:15,824
It stank.
The whole business stank.

356
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:30,772
- Got anything vegetarian?
- No guacamole bullshit here, buddy.

357
00:42:32,814 --> 00:42:36,580
- I'll have a latte, then.
- Latte? The coffee's over there.

358
00:42:36,652 --> 00:42:38,813
Right.

359
00:42:46,195 --> 00:42:49,687
Holberg's autopsy confirms that he died
from a blow to the head.

360
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:55,294
It cracked his skull, hit an artery
and led to hemorrhaging of the brain.

361
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:59,238
The murderer was most likely
a right-handed male.

362
00:42:59,308 --> 00:43:01,708
So it wasn't a crazy old woman
from Grindavík

363
00:43:01,777 --> 00:43:03,836
taking revenge after all these years.

364
00:43:03,912 --> 00:43:07,678
- Hardly Kolbrun's sister, Elín.
- Ellidi?

365
00:43:07,749 --> 00:43:12,584
Can't we just extend his sentence
and close the case? End of story.

366
00:43:12,654 --> 00:43:15,316
Is that what they taught you
in America?

367
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:18,826
They found a benign tumor
in Holberg's brain

368
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:21,954
and skin discoloration linked to it.

369
00:43:26,268 --> 00:43:29,396
- Aude died from a malignant tumor.
- Yes.

370
00:43:29,471 --> 00:43:31,837
You said Holberg's sister
also died young.

371
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:33,772
I'll try to find the cause.

372
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:38,575
We have to find out if Aude
is definitely Holberg's daughter.

373
00:43:38,647 --> 00:43:40,911
How?

374
00:43:40,983 --> 00:43:43,144
There's only one option.

375
00:43:56,164 --> 00:43:58,598
Careful, now.

376
00:44:02,337 --> 00:44:05,864
Body snatchers.
Grave robbers.

377
00:44:05,941 --> 00:44:10,901
Grave robbers. Grave robbers.
Body snatchers.

378
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:16,175
Body snatchers.
Grave robbers.

379
00:44:21,256 --> 00:44:24,817
Grave robbers.
Body snatchers.

380
00:44:24,893 --> 00:44:26,451
Hold her back.

381
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:31,023
I'll never forgive you for this.
Never. Mark my words.

382
00:44:31,099 --> 00:44:36,298
I understand that, but the investigation
into Holberg's murder must go on.

383
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:41,172
Is that monster going to torment us
beyond the grave?

384
00:44:43,011 --> 00:44:44,774
Can't you see what you've done?

385
00:44:44,846 --> 00:44:49,283
You're no better than sergeant Rúnar,
that filth of a cop.

386
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,785
I should never have spoken to you.
Never.

387
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:02,287
What the fuck are you doing here?

388
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:11,088
Ellidi sends his regards from prison.

389
00:46:13,235 --> 00:46:16,170
He told me to ask you
what happened to his friend Gretar.

390
00:46:16,238 --> 00:46:18,263
I don't know.

391
00:46:18,673 --> 00:46:21,733
He said he is going to kill you
when he gets out.

392
00:46:24,246 --> 00:46:26,476
I hope he won't be too late.

393
00:46:28,216 --> 00:46:31,276
This is ridiculous.

394
00:46:33,422 --> 00:46:36,789
- How many women are on the list?
- 105 women.

395
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:40,191
Plus another 61
who've moved away from Grindavík.

396
00:46:40,262 --> 00:46:43,390
That makes 166 oldies.
What are we supposed to do?

397
00:46:43,465 --> 00:46:47,765
Knock on the door and ask all these
grannies if they were raped 30 years ago?

398
00:46:47,836 --> 00:46:50,100
Abitharsh, don'tyouthink?

399
00:46:50,739 --> 00:46:52,969
I don't see
how we can do it differently.

400
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:57,307
"Excuse me, but were you raped
when you were younger?

401
00:46:57,379 --> 00:47:01,145
"No? sorry to bother you."

402
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:02,444
And then what?

403
00:47:02,517 --> 00:47:06,078
If she's kept quiet all this time,
why should she want to talk now?

404
00:47:06,154 --> 00:47:09,180
- Play it by ear. Question of psychology.
- Psychology?

405
00:47:09,257 --> 00:47:13,318
Yes. Try to get invited in,

406
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:18,128
Sit down,

have a coffee and a chat.

407
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,862
Just be a bit of a pussy.

408
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,422
- Have you ever been raped?
- What?

409
00:47:48,497 --> 00:47:51,625
I was asking
if you've ever been raped.

410
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,329
Raped.
Have you ever been raped?

411
00:47:55,403 --> 00:47:57,234
No, thank you.

412
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:03,907
What can I do for you, my dear?

413
00:48:03,979 --> 00:48:07,244
I'm sigurdur Óli, a crime
police investigator from Reykjavik.

414
00:48:07,315 --> 00:48:09,806
- lsn't that something?
- I'm investigating a rape.

415
00:48:09,885 --> 00:48:13,719
A rape? Here in Grindavík?
When? Last night?

416
00:48:13,788 --> 00:48:16,655
No, back in the '70s.

417
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:26,824
I don't know how to put this,
but were you raped back then?

418
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:35,399
- You don't fool me that easily.
- What?

419
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:41,909
I've had it.

420
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,712
What?
Did she recognize me?

421
00:48:43,785 --> 00:48:47,516
No, she thought she was
on Candid Camera.

422
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:03,803
Do come in.

423
00:49:05,307 --> 00:49:10,006
She stopped giving off scent long ago,
but her body's still in good shape.

424
00:49:10,078 --> 00:49:12,046
What?

425
00:49:12,113 --> 00:49:14,138
I need to get a new card.

426
00:49:17,419 --> 00:49:21,856
The blow would have killed him
almost instantly.

427
00:49:21,923 --> 00:49:24,414
He'll have seen the tunnel,

the bright light.

428
00:49:24,492 --> 00:49:26,483
Didn't he just go the other way?

429
00:49:26,561 --> 00:49:29,325
I can't see
whether men were good or bad.

430
00:49:29,397 --> 00:49:33,629
But I can see he suffered from constipation,
which is not uncommon at his age.

431
00:49:33,702 --> 00:49:36,637
This could just as easily be
the heart of a saint.

432
00:49:39,474 --> 00:49:43,934
Right. A constipated saint.
What about the brain tumor?

433
00:49:44,012 --> 00:49:47,072
I found a small benign tumor
in the brain

434
00:49:47,148 --> 00:49:51,141
and skin discolorations,
especially under his arms.

435
00:49:51,219 --> 00:49:52,880
What about Aude?

436
00:49:52,954 --> 00:49:54,717
- Aude?
- The girl we dug up.

437
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:59,192
She's supposed to have died
from a brain tumor.

438
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:02,354
Have you heard the story
about Albert Einstein?

439
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:04,993
Albert Einstein?

440
00:50:05,066 --> 00:50:08,832
What about Thomas Harvey,
the pathologist?

441
00:50:08,903 --> 00:50:11,838
No, I've never heard of him.

442
00:50:11,906 --> 00:50:15,398
He was on duty when Einstein died.

443
00:50:15,477 --> 00:50:17,775
A curious chap.

444
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:20,041
He performed the autopsy.

445
00:50:20,115 --> 00:50:23,346
Because it was Einstein,

he couldn't resist the temptation

446
00:50:23,418 --> 00:50:27,252
of opening the skull and taking a look
at the brain. But that wasn't all.

447
00:50:27,322 --> 00:50:30,485
He stole the brain and took it home.

448
00:50:30,558 --> 00:50:35,018
Lost his job, of course,
when the theft was discovered.

449
00:50:35,096 --> 00:50:38,122
But he became a living legend.

450
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:41,191
He kept the brain on his mantelpiece.

451
00:50:41,269 --> 00:50:44,432
- ls this true?
- True as daylight.

452
00:50:45,974 --> 00:50:48,602
Why are you telling me this?

453
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:51,077
Her brain's missing.

454
00:50:51,146 --> 00:50:52,738
What? Aude's brain?

455
00:50:52,814 --> 00:50:56,250
If they took the brain
to investigate the tumor,

456
00:50:56,317 --> 00:50:59,809
they would not have had time
to put it back before the funeral.

457
00:50:59,888 --> 00:51:02,618
It had to be fixated in formaldehyde.

458
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:07,060
And where do they keep brains
these days?

459
00:51:07,128 --> 00:51:08,561
Jar City.

460
00:51:09,731 --> 00:51:11,528
Jar City?

461
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:16,730
If we find the brain, we'll establish

more quickly the cause of Aude's death.

462
00:51:25,814 --> 00:51:28,374
- Now watch this.
- Good luck.

463
00:51:36,691 --> 00:51:39,159
I'm Elínborg, a police...

464
00:51:39,227 --> 00:51:42,424
- Are you investigating the murder?
- Yes, how did you guess?

465
00:51:42,497 --> 00:51:45,796
Everyone's talking about it.
My neighbor filled me in.

466
00:51:45,867 --> 00:51:50,566
- Yes, we talked to her earlier.
- Do come in and tell me more.

467
00:51:50,638 --> 00:51:53,004
Thank you.

468
00:51:53,074 --> 00:51:56,510
- ls that you?
- Yes, I wasn't such a bad-looker.

469
00:51:58,246 --> 00:52:00,680
Ever hear the name Holberg?

470
00:52:00,749 --> 00:52:02,239
- Yes.
- Really? How?

471
00:52:02,317 --> 00:52:05,514
My neighbor told me about him
this morning.

472
00:52:05,587 --> 00:52:07,987
Of course.

473
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,760
He gets a bit excited around strangers.

474
00:52:17,031 --> 00:52:22,162
We're looking for a woman who knew
Holberg and lived in Grindavík in the '70s.

475
00:52:22,237 --> 00:52:24,535
It's rather a sensitive matter.

476
00:52:24,606 --> 00:52:27,302
He raped her.

477
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:32,005
And how is it connected
with his murder decades later?

478
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,548
Unfortunately I can't tell you.

479
00:52:34,616 --> 00:52:39,110
Well, then I don't know
how I can help you.

480
00:52:40,488 --> 00:52:44,584
Sorry to have to ask you this,
but have you ever been raped?

481
00:52:45,794 --> 00:52:47,694
No, unfortunately.

482
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:52,296
I mean, unfortunately
I can't help you there.

483
00:52:53,434 --> 00:52:56,926
And you've never heard
of Holberg before?

484
00:52:57,005 --> 00:53:00,964
Believe me,

I'd remember if I'd been raped.

485
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:22,025
So you're looking for Jar City.

486
00:53:30,638 --> 00:53:36,076
I understand you look after
the remains of the organ collection.

487
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:39,877
Is this to do with Aude?

488
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:43,042
Do you know her?

489
00:53:46,921 --> 00:53:49,515
What do you know about Aude?

490
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:53,925
Has it got something to do
with the Northmarsh murder?

491
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:58,324
The coroner's report
mentions only a brain tumor.

492
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,629
There are no further details.

493
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:05,036
I saw that report.
It's very unprofessional.

494
00:54:05,106 --> 00:54:08,940
It's a hereditary disease -
neurofibromatosis.

495
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:18,009
Some people live normal lives
without it ever surfacing.

496
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:21,419
They are symptom-free carriers.

497
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:25,118
But it's much more common for
the symptoms to appear at an early age

498
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:31,132
in the form of body marks
and skin tumors.

499
00:54:36,571 --> 00:54:38,095
Where is she?

500
00:54:41,476 --> 00:54:43,876
Who?

501
00:54:43,945 --> 00:54:45,242
Aude.

502
00:54:46,848 --> 00:54:52,013
You mean Aude's brain.

503
00:56:41,562 --> 00:56:42,654
Eva.

504
00:57:36,217 --> 00:57:37,445
Is Eva in?

505
00:57:37,518 --> 00:57:40,078
No, but perhaps you could tell me
where she is.

506
00:57:40,154 --> 00:57:42,782
- Are you trying to be funny?
- I'm not the funny type.

507
00:57:42,857 --> 00:57:45,325
Shut up, you old fag.
Let us in.

508
00:57:45,693 --> 00:57:47,854
We know the slut is in here.

509
00:57:47,929 --> 00:57:49,897
- What?
- Your daughter's a slut.

510
00:57:52,633 --> 00:57:55,397
Get the fuck out of here.

511
00:57:56,104 --> 00:57:58,664
And don't ever dare come back

512
00:58:24,465 --> 00:58:27,025
I need an ambulance
to Ljósheimar 14.

513
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:30,764
A young man fell down the stairs.

514
00:58:30,838 --> 00:58:33,170
No, I don't have a clue
about his name.

515
00:58:33,674 --> 00:58:34,766
Hi.

516
00:59:02,136 --> 00:59:06,197
I'm looking for Eddie.

517
00:59:18,052 --> 00:59:21,453
Did you think Eva would get special
treatment because you're a cop?

518
00:59:21,522 --> 00:59:25,219
- How much does she owe you?
- Two thousand.

519
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:28,262
- Can we make a deal on that?
- If you like.

520
00:59:29,897 --> 00:59:32,263
You'll get more next week.

521
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:43,367
I'd try to find Eva before Ellidi does.

522
00:59:43,444 --> 00:59:45,571
How does Ellidi come into this?

523
00:59:45,646 --> 00:59:50,379
Ellidi broke out of prison last night.
And he's mad at you.

524
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,883
Where is she?

525
01:00:22,316 --> 01:00:23,510
Eva.

526
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:38,995
Eva.

527
01:00:40,601 --> 01:00:42,330
Dad.

528
01:01:34,822 --> 01:01:36,790
Evening.

529
01:01:37,658 --> 01:01:39,558
Sorry.

530
01:02:06,387 --> 01:02:08,287
Fuck.

531
01:03:20,628 --> 01:03:23,062
Hello. Anybody there?

532
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,445
Open up the fucking door.

533
01:04:01,735 --> 01:04:03,930
Don't I have to have an abortion?

534
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,707
I'm so scared
I may have harmed the baby.

535
01:05:14,909 --> 01:05:17,070
The old girl was right.

536
01:05:18,712 --> 01:05:20,509
It stinks.

537
01:05:23,284 --> 01:05:27,550
The area is all one fucking marshland,
Slowly going down.

538
01:05:29,456 --> 01:05:32,584
Look.
The floor's been broken up.

539
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,992
Probably to repair the pipes.

540
01:05:35,062 --> 01:05:37,997
Are you saying it's hollow underneath?

541
01:05:38,065 --> 01:05:41,762
A perfect place
to hide your nearest and dearest.

542
01:05:43,437 --> 01:05:48,136
It's a sunday,
but I'll see if I can still get a crew.

543
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:50,768
If Gretar was buried in the '70s,

544
01:05:50,844 --> 01:05:54,336
rotting away ever since,
don't you think he'll be here tomorrow?

545
01:05:54,415 --> 01:05:57,816
- Ellidi sends his regards.
- What do you mean?

546
01:05:57,885 --> 01:06:00,149
He's looking for you.

547
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:01,778
- Did he break out again?
- Yes.

548
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:05,052
- Why wasn't I informed?
- Call the prison.

549
01:06:05,125 --> 01:06:07,992
If they work sundays, that is.

550
01:06:08,062 --> 01:06:11,828
But I suspect sergeant Rúnar's
in for a little social call.

551
01:06:21,041 --> 01:06:24,135
No need to wait up for me, love.

552
01:06:24,211 --> 01:06:26,907
I'm on a stakeout.

553
01:06:26,981 --> 01:06:28,949
No, in Sandgerdi.

554
01:07:44,024 --> 01:07:47,824
You should have left us alone,
you bastard,

555
01:07:47,895 --> 01:07:53,561
instead of turning Gretar
against me and Holberg.

556
01:07:53,634 --> 01:07:59,038
No wonder you were scared shitless
when we killed him.

557
01:07:59,106 --> 01:08:02,303
You didn't want to be connected
to a murder, did you?

558
01:08:02,376 --> 01:08:05,539
This is sigurdur Óli.
I need backup. I'm on a stakeout.

559
01:08:05,612 --> 01:08:07,944
Just look at you.

560
01:08:08,015 --> 01:08:11,974
An old dirtbag with shit
halfway up your back.

561
01:08:12,052 --> 01:08:17,854
Who's going to wipe your ass now when
you can't misuse the police force anymore?

562
01:10:12,105 --> 01:10:14,005
Well, Gretar.

563
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:17,371
So that's where you've been hiding.

564
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:31,316
I think we've found
our mystery woman from Grindavík.

565
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:31,574
What?

566
01:11:41,028 --> 01:11:43,189
What have you discovered?

567
01:11:44,531 --> 01:11:46,863
We have no secrets anymore.

568
01:11:55,609 --> 01:11:57,839
Did he rape you, Mother?

569
01:12:03,984 --> 01:12:06,316
You have to tell me the truth.

570
01:12:19,933 --> 01:12:23,528
Why do you think
Ellidi and Holberg killed Gretar?

571
01:12:23,603 --> 01:12:27,630
Rúnar dropped
Kolbrun's rape charges,

572
01:12:28,342 --> 01:12:32,039
but kept the evidence
So he could use the trio for dirty jobs.

573
01:12:32,112 --> 01:12:34,239
Gretar pushed the others too hard,

574
01:12:34,314 --> 01:12:37,715
So they killed Gretar to get him
and the sergeant off their backs.

575
01:12:37,784 --> 01:12:39,945
What kind of dirty jobs?

576
01:12:43,056 --> 01:12:45,217
Maybe she can tell.

577
01:12:45,292 --> 01:12:48,523
It would at least explain why
the sergeant assigned himself

578
01:12:48,595 --> 01:12:51,257
the case of Gretar's disappearance.

579
01:12:51,331 --> 01:12:53,856
How?

580
01:12:53,934 --> 01:12:57,028
So he could close the case

581
01:12:57,104 --> 01:13:00,164
and avoid being connected to a murder.

582
01:13:22,396 --> 01:13:23,761
Do come in.

583
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:51,079
I recognized him right away
from the photos in the papers.

584
01:13:51,158 --> 01:13:53,285
Maybe I should have...

585
01:13:58,832 --> 01:14:01,562
What are you trying to say?

586
01:14:01,635 --> 01:14:07,733
You've been looking for the woman
Holberg raped in Grindavík.

587
01:14:09,276 --> 01:14:10,800
It's me.

588
01:14:13,113 --> 01:14:15,274
You call this rape?

589
01:14:40,507 --> 01:14:44,568
My husband spent
half our marriage at sea.

590
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:49,174
I was lonely
and drank a lot at the time.

591
01:14:50,951 --> 01:14:52,976
But why the photos?

592
01:14:54,321 --> 01:14:57,313
I had no idea
I was being photographed

593
01:14:57,390 --> 01:15:02,225
until Gretar turned up and threatened
to show them to my husband.

594
01:15:03,530 --> 01:15:05,521
Blackmail.

595
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,191
Why didn't you go to the police?

596
01:15:09,269 --> 01:15:13,865
Everyone knew that sergeant Rúnar,
the head of the district police,

597
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:16,807
manipulated the trio.

598
01:15:16,877 --> 01:15:21,109
It was a setup,
and they were being used by him.

599
01:15:24,584 --> 01:15:28,418
It was made very clear to me
that if I didn't pay up,

600
01:15:28,488 --> 01:15:30,388
I'd be denounced as a whore.

601
01:15:32,893 --> 01:15:38,695
You make one mistake in life,
and it haunts you forever.

602
01:15:48,275 --> 01:15:50,641
When was he born,
your youngest son?

603
01:16:05,025 --> 01:16:07,687
Did you ever consider abortion?

604
01:16:07,761 --> 01:16:09,695
All the time

605
01:16:09,763 --> 01:16:13,665
Until it was too late.

606
01:16:14,901 --> 01:16:18,598
But the child could also
have been my husband's.

607
01:16:20,707 --> 01:16:23,904
Your son Örn has been researching
the death of a girl in 1974,

608
01:16:23,977 --> 01:16:26,969
who was most likely his half-sister.

609
01:16:27,047 --> 01:16:28,537
Her name was Aude.

610
01:16:30,984 --> 01:16:34,977
How did he find out
that Holberg was his father?

611
01:16:35,055 --> 01:16:39,253
After our little angel died -
his daughter Kola -

612
01:16:39,326 --> 01:16:41,317
Örn, my son,
became obsessed with...

613
01:16:41,394 --> 01:16:44,921
Hold on.
What did she die of?

614
01:16:44,998 --> 01:16:48,126
She was only five.

615
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:55,869
The doctors said
it was a genetic brain disease.

616
01:16:58,511 --> 01:17:00,445
Neurofibromatosis.

617
01:17:06,453 --> 01:17:08,683
My God.

618
01:17:09,756 --> 01:17:12,486
What have I done?

619
01:17:12,559 --> 01:17:14,720
I killed Kola.

620
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:20,288
Holberg and I killed the little angel.

621
01:17:42,055 --> 01:17:44,148
Stay away from me.

622
01:17:49,095 --> 01:17:52,326
- What a bloody stench.
- Get out of here.

623
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,893
I have every right to be here.
I'm your son. Your prodigal son.

624
01:18:00,840 --> 01:18:03,308
Looking for new victims?

625
01:18:03,376 --> 01:18:06,573
Can I ask you a question, Dad?

626
01:18:06,646 --> 01:18:10,514
Dad. Did you rape any other women
aside from Mom?

627
01:18:10,583 --> 01:18:15,486
- I'm calling the police.
- lt's about time.

628
01:18:16,323 --> 01:18:19,952
They could search your computer
while they're here.

629
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:29,735
What do you want from me?

630
01:18:31,404 --> 01:18:34,237
You haven't got a clue
about what happened.

631
01:18:35,041 --> 01:18:36,906
You couldn't care less.

632
01:18:36,976 --> 01:18:39,410
Right?

633
01:18:42,782 --> 01:18:46,582
I've never raped anyone in my life.

634
01:18:46,653 --> 01:18:48,985
It's all a fucking lie.

635
01:18:51,191 --> 01:18:55,059
They said I had a daughter.

636
01:18:56,196 --> 01:19:01,998
Her mother, Kolbrun,
charged me with rape but couldn't prove it.

637
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:04,059
I was never convicted.

638
01:19:04,804 --> 01:19:07,967
The disease
Should have died out with you.

639
01:19:10,009 --> 01:19:13,206
You should have been the last carrier.

640
01:19:14,414 --> 01:19:16,746
You were the last in line.

641
01:19:18,885 --> 01:19:21,547
Unmarried, childless.
No family.

642
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:26,051
But you're a rapist.
A lousy fucking rapist.

643
01:19:26,126 --> 01:19:29,562
- What do you mean, "a carrier"?
- Aude got the disease from you.

644
01:19:29,629 --> 01:19:32,564
I got the disease from you.

645
01:19:32,632 --> 01:19:35,533
There hasn't been an incident
of the disease in Iceland

646
01:19:35,602 --> 01:19:38,366
Since Aude died,
apart from my daughter, Kola.

647
01:19:43,109 --> 01:19:46,078
Now we're the last two standing.

648
01:19:48,615 --> 01:19:52,016
I didn't rape your mother.

649
01:19:52,085 --> 01:19:55,418
She was a fucking slut.

650
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:58,218
She cheated on your father
while he was at sea.

651
01:19:58,291 --> 01:20:00,885
Gretar photographed her in action.

652
01:20:02,128 --> 01:20:06,326
Why do you think
She never told anyone?

653
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,267
Get out of here,

you son of a whore.

654
01:20:10,336 --> 01:20:13,134
Don't ever let me see you again.

655
01:20:46,973 --> 01:20:49,533
No one here.

656
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:51,133
What a mess.

657
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:52,542
Nobody here.

658
01:21:05,925 --> 01:21:08,052
Disgusting.

659
01:21:13,867 --> 01:21:16,836
Icelandic paternity.

660
01:21:16,903 --> 01:21:17,927
I AM HlM!

661
01:21:18,004 --> 01:21:20,029
Does it worry you?

662
01:21:20,106 --> 01:21:23,473
People always said
I didn't look like either of my parents.

663
01:21:23,543 --> 01:21:26,376
- I've always had that feeling, too.
- What?

664
01:21:26,446 --> 01:21:28,607
That you were a bastard.

665
01:21:30,250 --> 01:21:32,810
Got your sense of humor back.

666
01:21:32,886 --> 01:21:34,683
What sense of humor?

667
01:21:34,754 --> 01:21:38,986
Call me if you find anything,
and declare him wanted.

668
01:21:39,058 --> 01:21:41,583
We suspected unauthorized access
of the database.

669
01:21:41,661 --> 01:21:43,561
Why didn't you notify the police?

670
01:21:43,630 --> 01:21:46,929
It's a sensitive matter
because of data privacy.

671
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,960
Personal data must only be used
for research purposes,

672
01:21:52,038 --> 01:21:55,474
and of course we didn't suspect a link
to the Northmarsh murder.

673
01:21:55,542 --> 01:21:56,839
How did he do it?

674
01:21:56,910 --> 01:21:59,708
He set up an unauthorized
research project.

675
01:21:59,779 --> 01:22:03,943
He forged signatures, pretended we were
researching the genetic transmission

676
01:22:04,017 --> 01:22:06,884
of a brain tumor disease
found in several families.

677
01:22:06,953 --> 01:22:11,014
He tricked the data protection committee,
the ethics committee and us.

678
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,718
The process so far has been...

679
01:22:13,793 --> 01:22:16,227
- Hello.
- I found a sawn-off shotgun barrel

680
01:22:16,296 --> 01:22:18,196
under his bed.

681
01:22:19,832 --> 01:22:21,663
Shotgun?

682
01:22:24,671 --> 01:22:27,435
- He's hardly going to use it to kill.
- Why not?

683
01:22:27,507 --> 01:22:30,169
Then he would have shot Holberg.

684
01:22:30,243 --> 01:22:34,270
- Alert all departments that he's wanted.
- sure.

685
01:22:34,347 --> 01:22:37,111
So that's how Örn got hold
of the names and ID numbers

686
01:22:37,183 --> 01:22:40,584
of all the people with family histories
of this disease?

687
01:22:40,653 --> 01:22:42,587
Can you please let us in?

688
01:22:44,023 --> 01:22:49,984
That's how he discovered that Holberg
was his father and Aude his half-sister.

689
01:22:50,063 --> 01:22:53,794
This could be extremely embarrassing
for the company.

690
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:58,428
We prefer to regard it
as a personal tragedy.

691
01:23:00,773 --> 01:23:05,210
You keep all these secrets
carefully categorized on computer.

692
01:23:10,016 --> 01:23:11,881
Old family secrets.

693
01:23:12,986 --> 01:23:16,979
Tragic stories, sorrow and death.

694
01:23:19,192 --> 01:23:22,389
In the hope
there'll be less in the future.

695
01:23:41,614 --> 01:23:43,673
Is that the girl you dug up?

696
01:23:53,026 --> 01:23:56,792
There was a break-in
at the morgue.

697
01:23:56,863 --> 01:23:58,296
Hello?

698
01:23:58,364 --> 01:24:00,764
- someone's broken in.
- shit.

699
01:24:00,833 --> 01:24:03,700
- ls there anything but bodies there?
- No. I'll meet you.

700
01:24:03,770 --> 01:24:06,068
Call the pathologist.

701
01:24:24,624 --> 01:24:26,524
What's going on?

702
01:24:26,592 --> 01:24:30,358
- He broke the window and climbed in.
- Who breaks into a morgue?

703
01:24:30,430 --> 01:24:32,694
Where are Holberg
and Aude's remains?

704
01:24:32,765 --> 01:24:35,495
- ls it linked to Holberg's murder?
- Could be. Hurry.

705
01:24:35,568 --> 01:24:37,229
In here.

706
01:24:37,303 --> 01:24:39,931
You keep this door unlocked?

707
01:24:43,042 --> 01:24:44,703
The girl's not here.

708
01:24:48,414 --> 01:24:50,712
Her bones are gone.

709
01:24:52,185 --> 01:24:55,814
Say, did you ever find her brain?

710
01:25:05,798 --> 01:25:07,732
Hello.

711
01:25:11,871 --> 01:25:13,964
- Hello.
- He's here.

712
01:25:14,040 --> 01:25:15,735
- What?
- He's here.

713
01:25:15,808 --> 01:25:20,836
- Who are you talking about?
- He's outside, staring through my window.

714
01:25:22,115 --> 01:25:23,912
Stay inside, I'll...

715
01:25:23,983 --> 01:25:25,041
Shit.

716
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:45,870
- Are you OK?
- He's in the cemetery.

717
01:25:45,938 --> 01:25:47,701
- Who?
- Örn, Aude's brother.

718
01:25:47,774 --> 01:25:49,799
Stop him before it's too late.

719
01:25:49,876 --> 01:25:52,538
I'll do my best.
Go inside and lock the doors.

720
01:25:52,612 --> 01:25:55,080
He saw you digging up Aude.

721
01:26:18,337 --> 01:26:20,168
You shouldn't have done it.

722
01:26:20,239 --> 01:26:23,640
You should have
let her rest in peace.

723
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:26,507
I had no choice.

724
01:26:36,622 --> 01:26:38,852
I'm sure you'll want this.

725
01:26:42,461 --> 01:26:44,656
The disease.

726
01:27:07,753 --> 01:27:10,085
Hand me the gun.

727
01:27:17,163 --> 01:27:23,534
You know what the geneticists
call us, me and Aude?

728
01:27:25,504 --> 01:27:28,837
Deviations.
We're called deviations.

729
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:38,278
My daughter once asked me
in the hospital:

730
01:27:38,351 --> 01:27:40,512
"Why do we have eyes?"

731
01:27:43,623 --> 01:27:46,091
"To see with," I said.

732
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,855
"No," she corrected me.

733
01:27:51,931 --> 01:27:54,627
"To cry with."

734
01:27:58,404 --> 01:28:01,396
What are you if you're not yourself?

735
01:28:04,677 --> 01:28:05,871
Easy now.

736
01:28:05,945 --> 01:28:07,071
Who are you then?

737
01:28:07,146 --> 01:28:10,047
- lt'll be all right.
- I didn't plan it this way.

738
01:28:10,116 --> 01:28:12,550
- lt'll be fine.
- Now it's too late.

739
01:28:40,646 --> 01:28:42,614
I'm sorry.

740
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,615
I didn't mean to be mad at you.

741
01:28:48,654 --> 01:28:53,114
But when I see the way you live,

742
01:28:54,327 --> 01:28:57,592
the way you waste your life...

743
01:29:00,633 --> 01:29:04,831
then watch a tiny coffin
come up from the ground...

744
01:29:07,373 --> 01:29:10,536
nothing really makes sense anymore.

745
01:29:12,778 --> 01:29:16,680
I don't know what's going on,
and I want to...

746
01:29:18,050 --> 01:29:20,814
Beat the hell out of me?

747
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:42,638
You think you can put on armor

748
01:29:42,708 --> 01:29:46,200
and defend yourself against it.

749
01:29:46,278 --> 01:29:51,113
That you can watch the filth
around you from a distance...

750
01:29:54,653 --> 01:29:57,588
Iike it's none of your business.

751
01:30:04,163 --> 01:30:09,362
But all this repulsion
haunts you like an evil spirit.

752
01:30:16,942 --> 01:30:19,274
In the end...

753
01:30:21,514 --> 01:30:25,678
you even forget
how ordinary people live their lives.
