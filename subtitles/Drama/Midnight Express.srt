1
00:03:02,863 --> 00:03:06,183
Excuse me.

2
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:17,060
- Nervous?
- No.

3
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:21,660
- I hate fIying.
- It's something I ate.

4
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:27,660
Maybe you're just excited
about getting home.

5
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,740
- I've got to go to the john again.
- I'II wait.

6
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,939
- No, I'II catch up to you. Okay?
- Okay.

7
00:04:38,693 --> 00:04:41,574
Passport.

8
00:04:52,732 --> 00:04:56,413
Basket.

9
00:05:20,651 --> 00:05:24,090
It's a frisbee.

10
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:29,250
You throw it and catch it.
It's a game.

11
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,969
A game ...

12
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:25,566
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, great. Want a piece of gum?

13
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:29,605
Thank you.

14
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:33,604
See this?
Janis JopIin died yesterday.

15
00:06:33,764 --> 00:06:36,724
Overdose.
There never was anyone Iike Janis.

16
00:06:36,885 --> 00:06:41,564
- There never was anyone Iike you.
- Knock it off.

17
00:06:41,725 --> 00:06:45,324
- You never take anything seriousIy.
- Nothing.

18
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:09,762
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

19
00:07:09,922 --> 00:07:15,041
They aIways have everything
ass backwards in Turkey.

20
00:07:16,241 --> 00:07:21,801
- BiIIy, what's the matter?
- Passport. Susan, get on the pIane.

21
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:29,161
- What's wrong, are you sick?
- Get on the pIane. Go.

22
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:58,119
I'm Iooking for my passport.

23
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:05,876
Harry, you'd better
get rid of those grenades.

24
00:09:03,991 --> 00:09:06,832
Get down.

25
00:10:12,068 --> 00:10:15,026
- Name?
- WiIIiam Hayes.

26
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:18,867
- WiIIiam ...
- Hayes.

27
00:10:19,027 --> 00:10:22,986
Hayes.

28
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:26,426
- American?
- That's right.

29
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:30,665
Yes, American. United States.

30
00:10:30,826 --> 00:10:33,385
American.

31
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:50,304
- Name?
- Jesus ... WiIIiam Hayes.

32
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:56,902
- Name?
- Hayes. H-A-Y-E-S.

33
00:12:33,695 --> 00:12:38,655
Howdy, BiIIy.
How are you doing? Okay?

34
00:12:40,934 --> 00:12:47,134
I think these gentIemen
have finished for the time being.

35
00:12:47,294 --> 00:12:51,052
If you'd Iike
to put your cIothes on.

36
00:13:11,652 --> 00:13:15,931
The officer wants to know
if you're afraid.

37
00:13:16,091 --> 00:13:19,211
No, I'm not afraid.

38
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:36,650
The officer said
there's nothing to be afraid of.

39
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:40,570
Co-operate,
and you'II be on the pIane home.

40
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:54,609
- Where did you get the hashish?
- From a cab driver.

41
00:13:54,769 --> 00:13:57,649
In the pIaying shop at the bazaar.

42
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:15,806
- WouId you recognise him again?
- I think so.

43
00:14:22,684 --> 00:14:25,685
You decided to fIy at a bad time.

44
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:31,246
GuerriIIas aII over the pIace,
bIowing up pIanes ...

45
00:14:31,404 --> 00:14:36,005
Four pIanes in four days.
Don't you read the newspapers?

46
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:40,164
There's been a shit storm
over the fIow of heroin from Turkey.

47
00:14:40,324 --> 00:14:44,045
- I didn't have heroin.
- A drug is a drug.

48
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:48,644
It was my first time.
It was onIy two kiIos.

49
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:52,203
It doesn't matter
if it was 2 or 200 kiIos.

50
00:14:52,364 --> 00:14:56,483
Catching you shows the worId
Turkey is fighting the drug trade.

51
00:14:56,642 --> 00:15:02,002
- Are you with the ConsuIate?
- Something Iike that. Cigarette?

52
00:15:02,843 --> 00:15:07,522
- What did you pay this cab driver?
- $200. My Iast 200.

53
00:15:07,682 --> 00:15:11,922
- How much did you figure to make?
- I'd onIy seII it to my friends.

54
00:15:12,082 --> 00:15:16,082
- I'm not a pusher. Honest.
- It beats working.

55
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:21,361
- Have you got a famiIy?
- Mother, father, brother, sister.

56
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,441
- Long IsIand.
- It'II be tough on them.

57
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,760
- GirIfriend?
- Yeah, she was on the pIane.

58
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,719
- She didn't know anything about it.
- Lucky girI.

59
00:15:38,879 --> 00:15:43,400
- She used to say I was Iucky.
- Let's hope so, BiIIy.

60
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:47,219
You seem Iike a nice enough kid.

61
00:19:47,379 --> 00:19:52,258
But you try it,
and I'II bIow your brains out.

62
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,656
Mom and Dad, this is the hardest
letter l've ever had to write.

63
00:20:26,816 --> 00:20:33,055
l hoped to get out of this quickly,
so you'd never know about it.

64
00:20:33,214 --> 00:20:39,334
But thatjust isn't possible now.
l don't know what's going to happen.

65
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:43,694
What can l say to you?
Will "l'm sorry" make a difference?

66
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:48,654
Will it ease the pain,
the shame you must be feeling?

67
00:20:48,813 --> 00:20:52,094
Forgive me, please.

68
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,851
CouId I have a bIanket?

69
00:21:10,012 --> 00:21:13,371
It's coId.
CouId I have a bIanket?

70
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:19,532
- A bIanket!
- Too Iate. Tomorrow.

71
00:21:19,691 --> 00:21:26,650
He'II be here tomorrow, I think.
Goodnight.

72
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:04,247
- Can you speak EngIish?
- Your ceII is open.

73
00:22:04,407 --> 00:22:08,607
BIankets, three ceIIs down.
You get me one.

74
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:26,000
I needed a bIanket.

75
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,760
WiIIiam Hayes.

76
00:23:46,438 --> 00:23:49,477
I needed a bIanket, I was coId!

77
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,151
Jesus ...

78
00:25:04,312 --> 00:25:07,431
Come on, you must stand.

79
00:25:08,432 --> 00:25:12,192
You'd better waIk around,
or your feet wiII sweII up.

80
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:19,231
- You've got to be crazy.
- We aII are. Smoke some of this.

81
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:26,391
You've been out for days,
taIking aII kinds of shit.

82
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:29,950
- How does it feeI?
- About as good as it Iooks.

83
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:37,231
Gecmis olsun. It's Turkish.
It means, ''May it pass quickIy.''

84
00:25:38,669 --> 00:25:42,629
- It Iooks Iike a cheap hoteI.
- The room service is Iousy.

85
00:25:42,789 --> 00:25:46,907
I'm Jimmy Booth.
This is Erich ... something Swedish.

86
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:50,028
- Just Erich.
- He cIeaned you up.

87
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:54,588
Thanks. I'm BiIIy Hayes ...
at Ieast I used to be.

88
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:35,465
- Why peacocks?
- They use them instead of dogs.

89
00:26:35,625 --> 00:26:42,024
They scream Iike mad if they're
disturbed and they don't get rabies.

90
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:48,143
- Who are the kids?
- LittIe fuckers ...

91
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:52,702
Thieves, rapists, murderers ...
You name it, they do it.

92
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,784
Don't trust any of them.
They teII Rifki everything.

93
00:26:56,943 --> 00:27:00,102
He's the squeaI around here.
He seIIs tea, -

94
00:27:00,263 --> 00:27:03,903
- hash, bIankets,
anything for a buck.

95
00:27:05,382 --> 00:27:08,941
- What are you in for, hash?
- Yeah.

96
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:13,221
- Where?
- At the airport.

97
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:19,302
That's heavy.
This ain't the good oId USA.

98
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,100
In Turkey, it's a fucking accident
if you're innocent.

99
00:27:23,261 --> 00:27:27,740
- Nobody here is innocent.
- Don't pay too much attention.

100
00:27:27,902 --> 00:27:33,300
Anything is possibIe in Turkey.
They may not hit you for smuggIing.

101
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:37,340
If they make it possession,
you might even get baiI.

102
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,659
If you make baiI, you're free.
Sneak across the border to Greece.

103
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:48,619
Sure, keep dreaming.
See where it gets you. Like Max.

104
00:27:48,778 --> 00:27:52,938
It's going to be a whiIe
before you taste a hamburger again.

105
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:57,418
- You broke the Iaw.
- The Iaw is sometimes wrong.

106
00:27:57,576 --> 00:28:00,378
The Iaw is never wrong!

107
00:28:01,577 --> 00:28:04,979
The fucking Iaw is.

108
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:16,176
- PeopIe get on his nerves.
- What's he in for?

109
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:19,137
SteaIing from a mosque.

110
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:22,456
- What did he steaI?
- Two candIesticks.

111
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:25,775
- That's aII?
- Jimmy has more baIIs than brains.

112
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:30,735
He was in for a year and a haIf
before he even toId his parents.

113
00:28:30,895 --> 00:28:36,095
- What about you?
- Hashish, Iike most foreigners.

114
00:28:36,254 --> 00:28:40,773
- What did they give you?
- 1 2 years. I had 1 00 grams.

115
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:46,934
You've got to get a good Iawyer.
TaIk to the EngIishman. Max.

116
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:50,813
He's been in the Iongest.
Seven years.

117
00:29:07,531 --> 00:29:11,651
Gastro. Stomach medicine.

118
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:18,251
It's got codeine in it.
It's the best I can do around here.

119
00:29:18,411 --> 00:29:20,691
Max ...

120
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:24,891
- Lawyers ..?
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:29:26,012 --> 00:29:29,930
There's no straight Iawyers
in Turkey.

122
00:29:30,091 --> 00:29:33,570
They're aII bent.

123
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,808
Bent as hairpins.
OccupationaI necessity.

124
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:43,569
They have speciaI cIasses
in corruption at night schooI.

125
00:29:44,889 --> 00:29:48,568
If you're suspected of honesty,
you're disbarred.

126
00:29:53,488 --> 00:29:57,848
I knew a Iawyer feIIow once.

127
00:29:58,007 --> 00:30:02,488
He got that Frenchman off.
La Roche.

128
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,688
A big smuggIer.

129
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:12,047
200 kiIos.

130
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:17,926
He put enough bread
in enough pockets. Got baiI.

131
00:30:18,085 --> 00:30:21,566
Vanished.

132
00:30:21,726 --> 00:30:26,405
- His name?
- Who?

133
00:30:26,565 --> 00:30:31,764
- The Iawyer.
- Lawyer?

134
00:30:31,924 --> 00:30:36,445
Who got the Frenchman off.

135
00:30:38,245 --> 00:30:43,844
YesiI is his name.

136
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:49,484
I don't know anything eIse
about him.

137
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:52,923
YesiI.

138
00:30:54,723 --> 00:30:59,522
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

139
00:30:59,683 --> 00:31:03,923
- Yeah, but how?
- Catch the midnight express.

140
00:31:04,083 --> 00:31:07,122
What's that?

141
00:31:09,641 --> 00:31:18,361
It's not a train.
It's a prison word for ... escape.

142
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,800
It doesn't stop around here.

143
00:32:10,877 --> 00:32:13,676
Dad, I'm sorry.

144
00:32:13,836 --> 00:32:16,917
Forget it.

145
00:32:17,075 --> 00:32:23,597
I'II punch you in the nose Iater.
We've got to get you out of here.

146
00:32:23,755 --> 00:32:28,276
This is a suit I brought for you.

147
00:32:29,475 --> 00:32:32,875
Smarten you up a IittIe.

148
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:39,833
- Are you aII right?
- Yeah.

149
00:32:39,994 --> 00:32:43,234
How's Mom?

150
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:47,234
WeII, she's bad.

151
00:32:47,393 --> 00:32:52,034
She couIdn't make the trip.
You know Mom. Her boy ...

152
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:58,312
Susan toId us
before we got your Ietter.

153
00:32:58,473 --> 00:33:01,552
She's saving to come back here ...

154
00:33:01,712 --> 00:33:07,152
Don't Iet her come.
How's Rob? How's Peg?

155
00:33:07,312 --> 00:33:10,472
They're the same. You know.

156
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:15,631
We toId the neighbours
you were in hospitaI in Europe.

157
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:22,031
This is StanIey DanieIs.
He's the American ConsuI here.

158
00:33:22,191 --> 00:33:29,669
BiIIy, we're going to do everything
in our power to get you out of here.

159
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:36,470
That's Necdit YesiI,
the Iawyer you asked for.

160
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:40,628
I know exactIy what you feeI,
but you must not worry.

161
00:33:40,789 --> 00:33:44,829
We'II get the right court
and the right judge.

162
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,308
I'II arrange everything, just right.

163
00:33:49,668 --> 00:33:55,828
I understand that if you get baiI,
it's easy to get across the border.

164
00:33:55,987 --> 00:34:02,109
That's what we're shooting for.
I've spoken to the State Department.

165
00:34:02,267 --> 00:34:07,346
Right now, reIations with the Turks
aren't too good. Nixon upset them.

166
00:34:07,506 --> 00:34:13,546
- Our best bet is right here.
- Dad, I'II pay you back for this.

167
00:34:13,707 --> 00:34:17,906
Money doesn't matter, BiIIy.
Not at this stage.

168
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:29,385
- Where did you get that Iimp?
- I twisted my ankIe.

169
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:34,345
- Where are you staying?
- The HiIton.

170
00:34:34,504 --> 00:34:39,784
- How do you Iike IstanbuI?
- Interesting pIace.

171
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:45,184
The food is Iousy. The crap
they seII in the restaurants ...

172
00:34:45,343 --> 00:34:50,343
I had to run to the toiIet.
You shouId have seen the toiIet.

173
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:57,583
I'II eat at the HiIton every night.
Steak, French fries and ketchup.

174
00:35:04,661 --> 00:35:07,701
BiIIy ...

175
00:35:07,863 --> 00:35:13,941
- Why did you do it?
- Money.

176
00:35:15,141 --> 00:35:18,740
I know you kids smoke that stuff
and we drink booze, -

177
00:35:18,901 --> 00:35:23,022
- but taking it across the border,
that's stupid.

178
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:25,540
I know.

179
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:31,299
Dad ... get me out of here.

180
00:35:31,459 --> 00:35:36,099
I promise you. Just sit tight.

181
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:40,979
Let me work with Mr. DanieIs
and Mr. YesiI here.

182
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:44,258
We'II get you out, okay?

183
00:35:44,419 --> 00:35:48,219
Hey, BiIIy ... Okay?

184
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,217
Okay.

185
00:37:29,849 --> 00:37:34,170
- What did that prosecutor say?
- It's not important.

186
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:39,450
We made our case. You spoke weII.
The judge Iiked you.

187
00:37:57,688 --> 00:38:01,327
Mr. Hayes, the judge is coming back.

188
00:38:41,923 --> 00:38:45,803
- Four years, two months.
- Four years?

189
00:38:45,963 --> 00:38:47,963
We'II appeaI.

190
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:53,963
It'II be reduced for good behaviour.
It is onIy for possession.

191
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:58,803
The prosecutor wanted
a Iife sentence for smuggIing.

192
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:04,282
To be honest, Mr. Hayes,
it is a great victory.

193
00:39:14,201 --> 00:39:20,360
With good time,
it works out to about three years.

194
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,561
And then there's the appeaI.

195
00:39:23,721 --> 00:39:31,800
DanieIs and YesiI
are aII working for you.

196
00:39:31,959 --> 00:39:35,598
We're trying to get you transferred.

197
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:41,399
DanieIs thinks there might be
a poIiticaI amnesty any month now.

198
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:48,637
AII right, BiIIy ...

199
00:39:48,799 --> 00:39:54,238
I know it sounds tough,
but we are going to get you out.

200
00:39:54,398 --> 00:39:59,518
I promise you.
Don't do anything stupid.

201
00:39:59,676 --> 00:40:03,237
They couId pIay with your sentence.

202
00:40:04,957 --> 00:40:08,037
AII right, now ...

203
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:16,636
I'm putting $500 in the bank.
Anything you need, you write.

204
00:40:16,796 --> 00:40:21,796
There's food here,
candy, writing paper, -

205
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:28,995
- books, cigarettes, soap,
toothbrush ...

206
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:37,154
I've soId insurance for 30 years.

207
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:40,794
Now I've got to see my own son ...

208
00:40:40,953 --> 00:40:45,314
Jesus!

209
00:40:48,994 --> 00:40:55,792
If I couId be where you are ...
I'd be there.

210
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:01,912
I Iove you, Dad.

211
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:34,748
You take good care of my boy,
or I'II have your fucking head!

212
00:43:03,901 --> 00:43:09,822
Dear Susan,
1970 has now passed into 1971.

213
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:13,821
You can drift in here
and never know you're gone.

214
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:19,981
You can fade so far out, you
don't know where you are anymore.

215
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:28,220
l find loneliness is a physical pain
that hurts all over.

216
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:01,499
To the Turks
everything is "söyle böyle".

217
00:44:01,658 --> 00:44:05,456
lt means "like this, like that. "
You never know what will happen.

218
00:44:07,135 --> 00:44:11,296
All foreigners are "ayip. "
They're considered dirty.

219
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:16,416
So is homosexuality, but they
do it every chance they get.

220
00:44:16,576 --> 00:44:21,015
There are about 1,000 things
that are "ayip".

221
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:26,215
You can stab or shoot somebody
below the waist but not above.

222
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:32,415
Stabbing somebody in the ass
is considered Turkish revenge.

223
00:44:34,774 --> 00:44:39,694
l know it must sound crazy to you,
but this place is crazy.

224
00:44:46,052 --> 00:44:49,334
One day,
one of the new kids was raped.

225
00:44:49,493 --> 00:44:53,733
So they picked out
four of the worst kids.

226
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:25,327
Then there's Rifki. The more
l know of him, the more l hate him.

227
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:29,204
$1 0 for this shit? You pig.

228
00:46:29,365 --> 00:46:32,844
There are no pigs in Turkey.

229
00:46:33,005 --> 00:46:38,885
- This shit is shit.
- No, it's good. Good shit.

230
00:46:39,044 --> 00:46:42,885
- You big shit.
- Yeah, me big shit.

231
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:04,322
You asshoIe.

232
00:47:08,522 --> 00:47:13,001
What is it with you?
Just what the heII is it, man?

233
00:47:15,921 --> 00:47:19,642
You don't fuck with me,
I don't fuck with you.

234
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,641
You fuck with me aII the time.
You make crummy tea.

235
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:30,559
- You rip us off on the hash.
- I make speciaI tea for you.

236
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:35,440
We have to Iive Iike brothers.
We have to be in here together.

237
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,280
For aII the money you've got,
you've got nothing.

238
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,118
- You are American, you don't know.
- Know what?

239
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:46,358
Dog eat dog.

240
00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:50,599
You fuck other man before he
fucks you. And you must fuck Iast.

241
00:47:58,677 --> 00:48:02,478
Come on down.

242
00:48:07,996 --> 00:48:14,556
Egbert ...
Sodding cat.

243
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:40,823
WiIIiam!

244
00:50:40,984 --> 00:50:45,224
Are you aII right?

245
00:50:45,384 --> 00:50:49,863
The new American Ambassador
is foIIowing your case.

246
00:50:50,024 --> 00:50:54,663
He says there is progress.
You want a cigarette?

247
00:50:55,383 --> 00:50:58,383
But there is another route ...

248
00:51:00,343 --> 00:51:03,462
... that is quite possibIe.

249
00:51:03,622 --> 00:51:07,102
For a proper amount of money,
it is possibIe -

250
00:51:07,262 --> 00:51:11,822
- to convince the ten officiaIs
to Iose track of your papers -

251
00:51:11,982 --> 00:51:16,541
- before the High Court in Ankara
confirms your sentence.

252
00:51:16,701 --> 00:51:24,581
And you couId be in Greece by
the time they discover the mistake.

253
00:51:27,061 --> 00:51:34,379
But I have to act before the
officiaI sentence is handed down.

254
00:51:35,738 --> 00:51:42,619
And for that
I must pay certain officiaIs.

255
00:51:54,418 --> 00:51:56,660
What's that?

256
00:52:02,896 --> 00:52:07,617
The bIueprints to the prison, man.

257
00:52:07,777 --> 00:52:13,657
There was this German architect
in the hospitaI.

258
00:52:13,816 --> 00:52:16,496
He Iet me copy them.

259
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:20,536
It's too bad
you didn't have a Xerox machine.

260
00:52:22,344 --> 00:52:25,223
There are two ways out of here.

261
00:52:25,384 --> 00:52:30,262
One is over the roof,
but that's kind of risky.

262
00:52:30,422 --> 00:52:36,023
The other way, I'II need your heIp,
and that is under.

263
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:40,862
A tunneI?

264
00:52:41,022 --> 00:52:46,661
- Are you serious?
- This is not StaIag 1 7.

265
00:52:46,821 --> 00:52:51,782
That's where you're wrong.
The tunneI is aIready buiIt.

266
00:52:51,941 --> 00:52:55,860
There's a basement
where they used to keep weapons.

267
00:52:56,020 --> 00:53:02,700
Beneath that are the catacombs the
Christians buiIt to bury their dead.

268
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,299
We're sitting
right on top of it ... here.

269
00:53:08,301 --> 00:53:13,818
The kraut says that there's
a bunch of hoIIow shafts.

270
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:18,180
They're Iike dumbwaiters,
aII aIong these waIIs.

271
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,178
One of them
is right next to our shower.

272
00:53:22,338 --> 00:53:25,897
If we get in there,
we can get down into the catacombs.

273
00:53:26,059 --> 00:53:29,858
With three of us working,
it shouIdn't take too Iong.

274
00:53:30,018 --> 00:53:34,817
I swear I heard a coupIe of dead
Christians singing down there.

275
00:53:34,977 --> 00:53:41,898
- You stop shitting me, man. Okay?
- How do we get into the shaft?

276
00:53:42,057 --> 00:53:46,177
We knock three times and
say we're a friend of the deceased.

277
00:53:46,337 --> 00:53:51,936
I'm getting this together and
I don't need no gastro-head aIong.

278
00:53:52,097 --> 00:53:55,095
You understand me?

279
00:54:02,135 --> 00:54:06,455
- We go through the waII.
- We go through the waII?

280
00:54:08,174 --> 00:54:10,976
Go through the waII.

281
00:54:31,132 --> 00:54:36,373
There's no reinforced steeI
in those shower waIIs.

282
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:42,010
It's reaI soft
from underground seepage.

283
00:54:42,171 --> 00:54:45,371
You can aImost push it over.

284
00:54:45,531 --> 00:54:48,691
AII we have to do ...

285
00:54:48,851 --> 00:54:53,811
We onIy have to use your screwdriver
to scrape the mortar out.

286
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:57,729
We puII out three stones
and squeeze through ...

287
00:55:06,689 --> 00:55:11,009
Squeeze through,
and get our ass down the shaft.

288
00:55:11,169 --> 00:55:15,690
- It's a two-night operation.
- What do we do in the catacombs?

289
00:55:15,849 --> 00:55:18,730
What do you want, a door?

290
00:55:18,889 --> 00:55:22,449
There's miIes of them down there.

291
00:55:22,607 --> 00:55:27,408
- You must be fucking crazy.
- They've got to come up somepIace.

292
00:55:27,568 --> 00:55:33,807
You won't find any catacombs,
you'II just finish up in section 1 3.

293
00:55:34,568 --> 00:55:40,207
BiIIy ... the tunneI or the roof?

294
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:43,848
Forget the waII.
Rifki's aIways there.

295
00:55:44,006 --> 00:55:49,685
- The roof is guarded.
- HeIp me get into the shaft.

296
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:54,085
If we get caught,
I'II get the shaft.

297
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:58,685
I'II be back up to
three years again, maybe more.

298
00:55:59,806 --> 00:56:04,325
Fuck it, then.
You choose your own death.

299
00:56:04,484 --> 00:56:09,725
I'II do this thing on my own.
I'm taking the roof out of here.

300
00:56:26,203 --> 00:56:29,283
No! I can't take it!

301
00:57:07,719 --> 00:57:11,278
Dear Susan,
Jimmy was caught and beaten badly.

302
00:57:11,438 --> 00:57:15,118
He got a severe hernia
and lost a testicle.

303
00:57:15,279 --> 00:57:18,839
He's been in the sanatorium
for months.

304
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:23,000
ln comparison,
my problems seem small.

305
00:57:23,158 --> 00:57:27,398
But 2?years have gone by.

306
00:57:27,557 --> 00:57:32,118
The Turks
are slowly draining my life away.

307
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:48,197
- Why do you keep your hair short?
- To remind me that I hate it here.

308
00:58:37,072 --> 00:58:42,351
Prison, monastery, cIoister, cave.

309
00:59:05,110 --> 00:59:07,950
Prison ...

310
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:08,061
- Okay.
- I've thought of another way.

311
01:01:08,219 --> 01:01:12,179
- Another way what?
- Out of here.

312
01:01:12,338 --> 01:01:17,818
When I was in the sanatorium,
there was onIy one guard on duty.

313
01:01:17,978 --> 01:01:22,378
- I couId have got out of there.
- Why didn't you?

314
01:01:22,538 --> 01:01:27,618
As soon as I couId waIk,
they threw me back in here.

315
01:01:27,778 --> 01:01:32,058
- Lucky you.
- I teII you, BiIIy ...

316
01:01:32,217 --> 01:01:37,138
Another ward in the sanatorium
had no guard on it at aII.

317
01:01:37,297 --> 01:01:40,297
- Who was in it?
- Three guys.

318
01:01:40,458 --> 01:01:44,975
- What was wrong with them?
- I don't know.

319
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:50,736
- I think they were dead.
- It figures.

320
01:01:57,176 --> 01:02:02,695
I've got to go. It's DanieIs!
Turkish justice has done it again.

321
01:02:02,855 --> 01:02:08,696
They're going to Iet me off.
Jimmy, I'm going home!

322
01:02:08,855 --> 01:02:13,613
God! ''I've got to go.''

323
01:02:29,893 --> 01:02:32,813
What's wrong?

324
01:02:32,972 --> 01:02:36,212
Sit down, BiIIy.

325
01:02:36,372 --> 01:02:41,291
I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

326
01:02:42,252 --> 01:02:46,372
- Is it Dad? Mom?
- No.

327
01:02:46,531 --> 01:02:52,650
- You're going to have a new court.
- What do you mean?

328
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:57,650
The prosecutor objected
to your sentence for possession.

329
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:02,171
He wanted a smuggIing conviction.
The Ankara court reviewed it.

330
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:08,449
It seems everyone wanted
an exampIe made. A scapegoat.

331
01:03:11,009 --> 01:03:17,089
We've been notified
that they rejected the sentence.

332
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:21,368
There were 35 judges in the court.

333
01:03:21,528 --> 01:03:25,247
28 voted for ... a Iife sentence.

334
01:03:27,528 --> 01:03:32,208
The Iower court in IstanbuI
had to go aIong with the decision.

335
01:03:32,366 --> 01:03:37,127
The judge Iikes you.
He notified your dad.

336
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:40,486
What do you mean, Iife?

337
01:03:40,647 --> 01:03:44,726
- Life for what?
- BiIIy!

338
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:50,047
I have 53 days Ieft!

339
01:04:07,005 --> 01:04:10,565
So now it's time for me to speak.

340
01:04:10,724 --> 01:04:14,524
What is there for me to say?

341
01:04:14,683 --> 01:04:20,044
When I finish,
you'II sentence me for my crime.

342
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:23,243
So Iet me ask you now:

343
01:04:23,404 --> 01:04:26,162
What is a crime?

344
01:04:26,322 --> 01:04:29,003
What is a punishment?

345
01:04:29,162 --> 01:04:35,162
It seems to vary from time to time
and pIace to pIace.

346
01:04:35,321 --> 01:04:41,241
What's IegaI today
is suddenIy iIIegaI tomorrow.

347
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:47,681
What's iIIegaI is suddenIy IegaI
because everybody's doing it.

348
01:04:47,841 --> 01:04:51,681
You can't put everybody in jaiI.

349
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:55,881
I'm not saying
this is right or wrong.

350
01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:00,760
I'm just saying
that's the way it is.

351
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:07,839
I've spent 3?years of my Iife
in your prison.

352
01:05:07,999 --> 01:05:12,519
I think I've paid for my error.

353
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:20,678
If it's your decision today
to sentence me to more years ...

354
01:05:34,958 --> 01:05:40,278
My Iawyer ... that's a good one.
He says, ''Be cooI, BiIIy.''

355
01:05:40,437 --> 01:05:46,596
''Be good. I'II get you a pardon,
an amnesty, an appeaI.''

356
01:05:47,276 --> 01:05:52,435
This has been going on now
for 3?years.

357
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:57,835
I've been pIaying it cooI.
I've been good.

358
01:05:59,077 --> 01:06:06,673
Now I'm damn tired of being good.
You said I had 53 days Ieft.

359
01:06:06,835 --> 01:06:13,793
You hung 53 days in my face,
and then you took them away.

360
01:06:13,953 --> 01:06:16,552
And you!

361
01:06:16,714 --> 01:06:20,874
I wish you couId be standing
where I'm standing right now.

362
01:06:21,034 --> 01:06:24,912
Then you wouId know something
that you don't know.

363
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:27,873
Mercy!

364
01:06:28,033 --> 01:06:35,312
You wouId know that a just society
is based on the concept of mercy.

365
01:06:35,472 --> 01:06:38,592
Its sense of fair pIay and justice.

366
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:44,751
But I guess that's Iike asking
a bear to shit in a toiIet.

367
01:06:55,470 --> 01:07:00,469
For a nation of pigs,
it sure is funny you don't eat them.

368
01:07:08,869 --> 01:07:14,229
Jesus Christ forgave the bastards,
but I can't.

369
01:07:17,230 --> 01:07:21,748
I hate.

370
01:07:21,908 --> 01:07:24,507
I hate you.

371
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:29,547
I hate your nation
and I hate your peopIe.

372
01:07:29,707 --> 01:07:35,387
I fuck your sons and daughters
because they're pigs.

373
01:07:35,547 --> 01:07:38,066
You're a pig.

374
01:07:43,226 --> 01:07:46,746
You're aII pigs.

375
01:08:07,504 --> 01:08:13,065
My hands are tied by Ankara.

376
01:08:18,502 --> 01:08:23,304
I must sentence you, WiIIiam Hayes,
to be imprisoned -

377
01:08:23,463 --> 01:08:26,463
- for a term no Iess than 30 years.

378
01:08:28,703 --> 01:08:32,181
May it pass quickIy.

379
01:08:55,221 --> 01:08:59,379
Got the old lstanbul blues

380
01:08:59,539 --> 01:09:02,900
lstanbul blues

381
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:08,379
they give me 30 years

382
01:09:08,540 --> 01:09:12,459
ain't got nothing left to lose ...

383
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:17,380
We are going to get you out.
l promise you.

384
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:22,979
Don't do anything stupid.
They could play with your sentence.

385
01:09:28,136 --> 01:09:32,417
l was busted at the border ...

386
01:09:32,577 --> 01:09:37,536
The best thing to do
is get your ass out of here.

387
01:09:37,697 --> 01:09:41,256
The best way you can.

388
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:22,133
Hey, I think I found it.
Come here.

389
01:10:23,373 --> 01:10:27,453
Listen to that.
Do you hear anything?

390
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:34,331
I toId you, you suckers.
You didn't beIieve me.

391
01:10:34,491 --> 01:10:37,892
Keep it down.

392
01:10:40,372 --> 01:10:44,132
Look how soft this is.
It'II be easy.

393
01:10:44,292 --> 01:10:51,811
Go and get Rifki's poker,
but don't wake him up.

394
01:11:08,569 --> 01:11:13,569
It's reaIIy soft. It's coming.

395
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:21,168
- Jimmy, it's coming.
- Here, use this.

396
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:29,126
It's coming reaI easy.
It's coming right out.

397
01:11:29,287 --> 01:11:34,367
It's easier than I thought.
It's a piece of cake.

398
01:11:44,325 --> 01:11:47,406
It's coming.

399
01:11:47,566 --> 01:11:50,166
Like butter.

400
01:11:51,205 --> 01:11:56,164
Hey, Max. Rifki.

401
01:12:11,483 --> 01:12:15,084
- Keep checking for Rifki.
- It's okay.

402
01:12:29,564 --> 01:12:34,642
- Watch it.
- I thought you wanted out of here.

403
01:12:37,601 --> 01:12:42,202
- They're Ioose.
- Let's try.

404
01:12:42,361 --> 01:12:45,921
- Watch your hernia.
- Fuck that.

405
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:55,081
- Okay? You got it?
- Yeah.

406
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:06,720
That's it. It's the shaft.

407
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:15,837
It's coming.

408
01:13:22,518 --> 01:13:26,317
It's okay.

409
01:13:32,437 --> 01:13:37,318
- Let's go, BiIIy.
- It's too Iate. We're not prepared.

410
01:13:37,477 --> 01:13:40,998
We'II go tomorrow.
It's too Iate.

411
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:44,236
Let's put them back. HeIp me.

412
01:14:08,915 --> 01:14:12,633
Any fuck-ups
and we shouId be back by dawn.

413
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:16,594
You got everything?

414
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:21,475
Maps, raiIroad, bus timetabIes.

415
01:14:21,634 --> 01:14:25,193
Okay, Iet's do it.

416
01:15:25,228 --> 01:15:28,507
- Can you see?
- No.

417
01:15:43,467 --> 01:15:47,866
Come on, Max,
get your ass down here.

418
01:15:49,186 --> 01:15:53,025
This way to IstanbuI, baby.

419
01:15:57,426 --> 01:16:01,545
Watch it.
Mind how you go there.

420
01:16:04,825 --> 01:16:09,865
Are you aII right?
Come down this poIe and cross over.

421
01:16:11,105 --> 01:16:14,463
Terrific.

422
01:16:17,943 --> 01:16:22,103
- AII right, it's a tunneI.
- Let's go.

423
01:16:44,581 --> 01:16:47,502
Come on, Max.

424
01:16:56,781 --> 01:17:00,300
Fuck! What is that? Shit!

425
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:22,177
Shit! It's a dead end.
The Turks must have bIocked it up.

426
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:25,457
Shit!

427
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:30,298
BiIIy!

428
01:17:32,977 --> 01:17:37,058
- What the fuck are we going to do?
- What time is it?

429
01:17:37,215 --> 01:17:40,616
4:30.

430
01:17:42,776 --> 01:17:48,936
- Go back.
- You must be fucking joking.

431
01:17:49,095 --> 01:17:54,175
We go back, seaI it up,
and come back tomorrow.

432
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:58,335
Every night, untiI we get out.

433
01:17:58,496 --> 01:18:02,334
There's got to be a way out.

434
01:18:16,612 --> 01:18:20,173
BiIIy, they found it. Rifki.

435
01:18:59,091 --> 01:19:02,170
No do, no do.

436
01:19:22,767 --> 01:19:28,568
I'm going to kick your brains
aII over your fucking kitchen.

437
01:19:28,728 --> 01:19:32,047
Fine! Good. Man to man.

438
01:19:32,207 --> 01:19:38,927
When we're finished, I'II bring
Hamidou and he'II kick your ass.

439
01:19:40,887 --> 01:19:43,806
Let's go, Max. Come on.

440
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:57,086
- I know what I'm going to do.
- What?

441
01:19:57,245 --> 01:20:01,246
- I'm going to cut his throat.
- Whose?

442
01:20:01,406 --> 01:20:04,325
Rifki.

443
01:20:07,164 --> 01:20:13,603
What have I got to Iose?
Anyway, I'd reaIIy enjoy it.

444
01:20:16,684 --> 01:20:22,604
Why don't you sit down?
You're in no shape to kiII anybody.

445
01:20:22,763 --> 01:20:28,003
- I want to cut his fucking throat.
- It's aIready been cut.

446
01:20:34,082 --> 01:20:37,282
Then I'II cut his baIIs off.

447
01:20:41,202 --> 01:20:46,201
You know, if you reaIIy
wanted to hurt Rifki ...

448
01:20:47,721 --> 01:20:53,481
His money. SteaI that
and you steaI his Iife's bIood.

449
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:58,880
CouId you see his face if everything
he had got snatched?

450
01:20:59,040 --> 01:21:03,040
- If we onIy knew where he hid it.
- I know where it is.

451
01:21:04,001 --> 01:21:06,360
Max ...

452
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,759
The money?

453
01:21:11,439 --> 01:21:16,639
Them that hides can find, says I.

454
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:24,757
I've seen him, the big tit.

455
01:21:26,957 --> 01:21:31,756
He Iooks at it, Iate at night.

456
01:21:34,758 --> 01:21:38,316
TaIking to it.

457
01:21:39,517 --> 01:21:42,196
Where?

458
01:21:45,276 --> 01:21:48,395
Max, where?

459
01:21:50,516 --> 01:21:53,555
The money, where?

460
01:21:55,955 --> 01:22:02,355
In his radio.
In the back of his radio.

461
01:22:05,914 --> 01:22:09,354
That's why he never pIays it.

462
01:24:02,584 --> 01:24:06,904
- He never had one.
- Soon he's back on the street.

463
01:24:07,065 --> 01:24:13,504
No friends, no money,
pIenty of enemies.

464
01:24:13,664 --> 01:24:16,903
- I'II drink to that.
- Me, too.

465
01:24:18,984 --> 01:24:25,904
- I've just got some news on Jimmy.
- ReaIIy? What?

466
01:24:26,063 --> 01:24:31,022
They sent him to hospitaI.
They ruptured his hernia again.

467
01:24:32,663 --> 01:24:37,541
- Shit!
- I guess he didn't taIk.

468
01:24:38,300 --> 01:24:45,702
- Look at Rifki, wearing a suit.
- Maybe he's got a new job.

469
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,261
Jesus! Not again.

470
01:25:39,617 --> 01:25:41,896
Hashish.

471
01:25:58,374 --> 01:26:02,055
You're kidding! Me?

472
01:26:06,774 --> 01:26:10,213
I didn't seII him anything.

473
01:26:21,853 --> 01:26:25,612
Rifki's Iying. He's a Iiar!

474
01:26:39,810 --> 01:26:42,092
Rifki!

475
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:38,392
Cigare, cigare, s'il vous plait.

476
01:30:52,831 --> 01:30:56,230
PIease, Iisten to me.

477
01:32:43,781 --> 01:32:49,580
Excuse me, I've been wanting
to speak to you. You're an American?

478
01:32:49,741 --> 01:32:53,903
Yes, America.
My name is Ahmet.

479
01:32:54,061 --> 01:32:59,419
I studied phiIosophy at Harvard,
and aIso at Oxford.

480
01:32:59,578 --> 01:33:04,499
I aIso studied in Vienna,
and now I study here.

481
01:33:04,659 --> 01:33:09,180
They put me here.
They say I raped a IittIe chiId.

482
01:33:09,339 --> 01:33:13,538
They'II never Iet me go.
They won't Iet you go, either.

483
01:33:13,698 --> 01:33:19,259
They teII you they'II Iet you go,
but in fact you stay.

484
01:33:19,418 --> 01:33:24,857
You see, we aII of us
come from a factory.

485
01:33:25,017 --> 01:33:29,777
Sometimes the factory makes
bad machines that don't work.

486
01:33:29,937 --> 01:33:34,257
The bad machines
don't know they're bad machines.

487
01:33:34,417 --> 01:33:41,376
But the factory knows you are one
of the machines that doesn't work.

488
01:33:41,537 --> 01:33:46,016
I think we've spoken enough
for today.

489
01:33:46,177 --> 01:33:48,897
I wish you goodnight.

490
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:30,088
My God!

491
01:35:34,607 --> 01:35:36,567
BiIIy!

492
01:35:40,166 --> 01:35:44,247
What have they done to you?

493
01:35:48,606 --> 01:35:52,088
Your famiIy is fine.

494
01:35:54,805 --> 01:35:59,326
Senator BuckIey has made
a speciaI pIea on your behaIf.

495
01:35:59,485 --> 01:36:04,006
They've caIIed you a pawn in the
game between Nixon and the Turks.

496
01:36:04,165 --> 01:36:08,283
The Ietters are coming in.
PeopIe do care.

497
01:36:14,924 --> 01:36:18,444
What?

498
01:36:18,604 --> 01:36:21,082
Take it off.

499
01:36:21,243 --> 01:36:28,362
- You'II just make yourseIf ...
- Take it off.

500
01:36:31,563 --> 01:36:34,002
S'il vous plait.

501
01:37:06,160 --> 01:37:10,079
BiIIy ...

502
01:37:12,080 --> 01:37:18,357
I wish I couId make it better
for you. PIease, don't.

503
01:37:20,519 --> 01:37:23,077
Don't.

504
01:37:36,837 --> 01:37:41,598
- Susan.
- Yes, BiIIy.

505
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:45,515
I Iove you.

506
01:37:49,756 --> 01:37:53,156
I Iove you.

507
01:38:00,555 --> 01:38:04,034
Your father gave me this for you.

508
01:38:04,195 --> 01:38:08,993
There's pictures of your mom
and dad, and Rob and Peg.

509
01:38:09,153 --> 01:38:14,674
And in the back there's a picture
of your oId friend Mr. FrankIin.

510
01:38:15,954 --> 01:38:19,234
Remember him? From the bank.

511
01:38:20,913 --> 01:38:25,632
He's over in Greece now.
He bought a ticket.

512
01:38:28,472 --> 01:38:33,712
I'II give it to them for you.

513
01:38:33,873 --> 01:38:39,430
Don't count on them.
Don't count on anyone but yourseIf.

514
01:38:47,912 --> 01:38:52,191
You're running out of time.
If you stay here, you'II die.

515
01:38:52,349 --> 01:38:58,310
You've got to get yourseIf together.
You've got to get out of here.

516
01:40:34,702 --> 01:40:38,142
Good morning, my American friend.

517
01:40:38,303 --> 01:40:42,822
There wiII be troubIe
if you go this way.

518
01:40:42,981 --> 01:40:46,860
A good Turk
aIways waIks to the right.

519
01:40:47,022 --> 01:40:51,661
Left is Communist.
Right is good.

520
01:40:54,501 --> 01:40:59,100
You must go the other way.

521
01:40:59,260 --> 01:41:02,499
The other way is good.

522
01:41:04,819 --> 01:41:08,739
Where are you going?
Why don't you waIk the wheeI?

523
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:13,538
What is the matter,
my American friend?

524
01:41:17,459 --> 01:41:21,257
A bad machine
doesn't know he's a bad machine.

525
01:41:21,418 --> 01:41:27,057
You stiII don't beIieve
you're a bad machine?

526
01:41:27,217 --> 01:41:30,217
To know yourseIf is to know God.

527
01:41:30,378 --> 01:41:34,896
The factory knows,
that's why they put you here.

528
01:41:35,057 --> 01:41:40,857
- In time you'II know.
- I aIready know.

529
01:41:41,015 --> 01:41:46,736
You are a bad machine, that's why
the factory keeps you here.

530
01:41:46,895 --> 01:41:49,696
Do you know how I know?

531
01:41:49,855 --> 01:41:54,455
I know because I'm from the factory.

532
01:41:54,615 --> 01:41:57,535
I make the machines.

533
01:44:25,803 --> 01:44:29,762
Max.

534
01:44:31,761 --> 01:44:34,643
Max!

535
01:44:38,602 --> 01:44:45,000
I'm going away.
I've come to say goodbye.

536
01:44:46,642 --> 01:44:51,640
You see, if I stay here,
I'm going to die.

537
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:56,320
You'II die. Don't die, Max.

538
01:44:56,479 --> 01:45:00,201
PIease, don't die.

539
01:45:00,360 --> 01:45:03,719
I'm going to come back for you.

540
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:07,959
You hang on for me.

541
01:46:58,470 --> 01:47:03,789
You're not taking me
to the sanatorium!

542
01:53:12,289 --> 01:53:29,875
THE END
