3
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,900
What are you doing?

4
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,390
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

5
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:27,110
I used to live here. My father was Jack Daly. 
I've been abroad for some time.

6
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,810
Mr. Daly did mention his 
son when we bought the house.

7
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,951
I didn't mean to frighten you, sorry.

8
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,599
So have you moved back into the area?

9
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:40,299
Yes, a small place, not far from here.

10
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,556
Oh yes, you're back already? Okay.

11
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,650
Yes, I spoke to the supervisor and as I thought,
you don't qualify for assistence.

12
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,555
Did you tell them, that I have
nowhere else to live?

13
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,570
This is about rules and regulations.

14
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,819
But surely you must have some 
relatives you can stay with.

15
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,315
No.

16
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:07,069
Fill in those forms and drop
them back and we'll see what happens, okay?

17
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,470
That's the best I can do.

18
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,835
-Not the confident type.
-Maybe he's got some gear.

19
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,970
Does he look like a skag-head to you?

20
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,812
You wanna give him a rattle?

21
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,315
No.

22
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,733
Leave him for now.

23
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,011
Alright?

24
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,116
I'm Cathal.

25
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,110
Do you talk at all?

26
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,192
You live here, don't ye?

27
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,370
There's no shame in it.

28
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:49,393
Look... I've nowhere else either, 
except me car.

29
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,518
Made it in life, me.

30
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,019
I'm Fred.

31
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,094
Glad to meet you, Fred.

32
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,989
You know, you've nothing to fear from me.

33
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,234
You here long?

34
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,190
A while now.

35
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,869
Want a drag?

36
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,770
No, I don't do drugs.

37
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,190
If I was to indulge...

38
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,750
...well... gin used to be my tipple. 

39
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,513 
Yea, sophisticated gentleman.

40
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,733
Looking at me here today,
not many would say that.

41
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,430
Where do you wash?

42
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
The toilets.

43
00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:00,030
Sometimes the back of my car,
I keep a drum of water in the boot.

44
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,197
Good idea!

45
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,290
Have you never tried the sports centre?

46
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,937
No. No, I haven't...

47
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,589
Yea, it's nice here.

48
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,835
Right, here... Age before beauty.

49
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,879
Now, your turn.

50
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,674
Now that works.

51
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,530
You wanna try?

52
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,030
No, thanks.

53
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,350
Should you be using an inhaler with cannabis?

54
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,050
I suppose it's no worse than alcohol.

55
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,352
Sometimes I smoke heroin.

56
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,677
Jesus!

57
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,950
You don't approve.

58
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,879
Why do you do it?

59
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,958
Cause it's a real break from this shite reality.

60
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,232
Nah, is your reality that bad?

61
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,230
My dad...

62
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,375
...prick...

63
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,912
...blamed me when me mum died.

64
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,059
Yeah, he chucked me out of the house and everything.

65
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,630
Just because somebody blames you
or pushes you away...

66
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,930
...doesn't mean you should give up.

67
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,509
Is that what you do?

68
00:16:39,158 --> 00:16:41,709
Where are all the cars going to?

69
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,075
Do you not remember being young?

70
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:12,514
Hey! Hey you!

71
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,310
Oh, Jesus!

72
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,995
Come here!

73
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,432
I'm sorry.

74
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,038
You're fine, I'm sorry. 

75
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,559
Jules.

76
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,639
Jul...

77
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,032
Fred.

78
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,636
Hello, Fred.

79
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,756
You swim well.

80
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,515
Oh... thank you.

81
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,958
Okay ladies, it's time now.

82
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,956
You're here to swim, yea?

83
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,639
You can leave gossiping for later time?

84
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,312
And leave the man alone.

85
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,570
Goodbye.

86
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,210
Good looking babes.

87
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,000
You're watching one.

88
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,859
Geez, I hope it's not the one in the back there.
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:16,960
Fuck, even I could do better than that.

89
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,713
No! No!

90
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,211
Look, if I tell you...
Promise man. I won't say a thing. My lips are sealed and all that.
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,500
See the blonde one there?
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,000
Nice choice.

91
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,952
Oooh.
Stop it!

92
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:45,832
Would you not go and ask her out?

93
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,017
That would work, hmm?

94
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,592
Hello, I'm Fred. I live in my car,
would you like to come to dinner?

95
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,075
Got ya!

96
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:01,435
€52 in the kitty... Minus five per week...

97
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,598
...for health club...

98
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,550
Less... food...

99
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:10,919
Shit.

100
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,093
Nice job, maybe you can do mine now.

101
00:21:17,093 --> 00:21:19,535
Come on, open up, we need to get going!

102
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:23,715
Yes?

103
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,314
I'm here about my claim.

104
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:29,998
Still in the car park?

105
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,749
Unfortunately, yes.

106
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:37,194
I think your claim is back,
just let me get the file.

107
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,794
They disallowed the claim.
You can appeal the decision.

108
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,736
But all the time I was in England,
I paid my dues!

109
00:21:56,786 --> 00:21:58,513
I'm sure you did.

110
00:21:58,513 --> 00:22:01,513
But if you've no fixed abode,
no assistence.

111
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,790
Will you come on, for fuck's sake,
we're waiting here!

112
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Do you want to get served in here today?

113
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,010
Listen, you have tried for 
a job, have you?

114
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,916
If he could get a job, 
do you think he'd be here?

115
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,571
It was just a thought.

116
00:22:12,571 --> 00:22:14,033
Come on, Fred, let's go.

117
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,916
Well that was brilliant.

118
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,191
You go ahead there, Fred, I'll catch up.

119
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,936
You alright, Cathal?

120
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:27,015
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll be there in a minute.

121
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,954
Look, I don't like having to do this, you know?

122
00:22:29,954 --> 00:22:31,155
I'm sorry.

123
00:22:31,155 --> 00:22:34,555
- I'm sorry, Frank.
- Any cash?

124
00:22:35,155 --> 00:22:35,795
No.

125
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,556
I don't have to come looking 
for you again, yeah?

126
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,330
I'll let it go this time.

127
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,950
I'll give you 20.

128
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,800
Jeez, that's great, Frank.

129
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,870
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

130
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,274
So that's 350 you owe me now, yeah?

131
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,353
How do you figure that?

132
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:06,072
20 for the wrap, 20 credit.

133
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,570
That's... thanks...
thanks, Frank.

134
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,007
And I want to see the money coming over soon, yeah?

135
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,470
Yeah.

136
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,070
-Good man.
-Thanks.

137
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,795
-Any jokes, Robbo, no?
-Fuck off.

138
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,034
What was that all about?

139
00:23:37,034 --> 00:23:38,436
Just friends of me brother's.

140
00:23:38,436 --> 00:23:40,495
Nothing to do with drugs, I suppose.

141
00:23:40,495 --> 00:23:42,314
Fred, you are not my mother.

142
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,292
They just wanted his number, that's all.

143
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,293
Come on, Fred, give yourself a break.

144
00:23:48,789 --> 00:23:51,470
We'll get you sorted. All in the good time.

145
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,269
Tempus fugit, Cathal.
And I'm not having much fun.

146
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,299
I'm going for a walk, I'll see you later.

147
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,299
Hello.

148
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,599
I'm so sorry, did I give you a fright?

149
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:57,999
No, no.

150
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,099
I'm happy you did.

151
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,009
I didn't realise you came to this church.

152
00:26:10,009 --> 00:26:11,293
I don't.

153
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,273
This is my first time.

154
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,013
You play very well.

155
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:18,258
Thank you.

156
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:22,153
So... do you live nearby?

157
00:26:22,353 --> 00:26:22,736
Yes.

158
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,550
Quite close, I've just come back from England

159
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,353
so I'm only settling in, really.

160
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,012
Would you like a cup of tea?

161
00:26:38,712 --> 00:26:39,712
I have one.

162
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,499
I better get back to the choir.

163
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,470
I hope to see you soon again.

164
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,470
Alright, man?

165
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,470
Cathal's not around, no?

166
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:16,770
No.

167
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,770
Right. He didn't leave anything for me?

168
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,470
No.

169
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,770
Right.

170
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,470
You know man, I'm Cathal's mate.

171
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,970
I know who you are.

172
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,070
You share things?

173
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:33,470
Yeah.

174
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:38,470
See, he was meant to leave me something.
A little package.

175
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,470
Oh, I thought you were the one with all the little packages.

176
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,870
Are you being funny?

177
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,070
You know maybe the best thing a so-called 
friend of Cathal's can do is leave him alone.

178
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,070
What are you, his grandma?

179
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:54,470
No, but I know what you are.

180
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:57,170
Have you got any money?

181
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:58,570
Not to spare, no.

182
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,055
Give me what you have then.

183
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:04,170
No.

184
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,460
Hey! Clippo!

185
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,837
Nearly missed you there, 
come on to me car. I have something for you.

186
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,409
You do know what you're doing?
Just asking.

187
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,253
A bit on the edge, tonight, Cathal?

188
00:28:55,353 --> 00:28:55,655
No.

189
00:28:56,003 --> 00:28:57,555
You need to be careful.

190
00:28:58,253 --> 00:28:59,955
I told you Fred.

191
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,552
I never inject. See?

192
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,000
An old watch.
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,980
Have you had it long?

193
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,475
Yea.

194
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,292
Where'd you get it?

195
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:26,952
Found it.

196
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,077
It's like pulling teeth, 
trying to get anything out of you.
00:29:29,077 --> 00:29:32,000
What difference does it make where I got it?

197
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,350
None whatsoever.

198
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,452
It's just... chat.

199
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,296
I took it from me dad.

200
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,437
Oh... right.

201
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,910
Here he is.

202
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,728
Hello Peter!

203
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,450
What's on the menu tonight?

204
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,830
Beef stew and rice.

205
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,293
Lovely stuff after a jay.

206
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,510
Look, about the sheltered accomodation...
there's one hell of a waitlist.

207
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,530
You need to be drugfree, Cathal.

208
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,470
What about your dad, Cathal?

209
00:30:20,470 --> 00:30:21,597
I don't think Cathal would want to see him.

210
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,838
Just maybe things have changed?

211
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,110
Yeah, wouldn't bet on it.

212
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,753
I better get going.

213
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,529
Don't worry, Fred, we'll sort something out.

214
00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:36,519
Thanks, Peter.

215
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:41,255
I hope so, I couldn't hack
another winter around here.

216
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,912
Okay ladies, listen up.

217
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,229
I have a new man today.

218
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:41,675
First man in the group. Men are 
not so popular here on aerobics, so...

219
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,116
First position, and...

220
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,930
1, 2, are you here for aerobics or what?

221
00:31:56,680 --> 00:32:00,170
You look at the ladies and see them move their parts?

222
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,313
I can show him if you like.

223
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,057
Just follow my lead, Fred.

224
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,069
It looks so easy and graceful when you do it.

225
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,913
- Okay?
- Yea.

226
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,393
Is that better?

227
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,436
-Here you go, Cathal.
-Oh, thank you.

228
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,354
37 minutes past three. 

229
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,574
What about a drive?

230
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,732
Drive?

231
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,708
I'm not getting into your car.

232
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,890
I have not driven it in ages.
And the tyres have been down for a long time.

233
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,590
They don't look down to me.

234
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,313
Turn right up here.
I know where I'm going.

235
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,396
Da hated me doing this.

236
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,150
You're attracting attention.
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,000
Alright, Grandda. 

237
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,635
Geez, you're gonna break no speed limits.

238
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:15,232
The point of driving on the public highway, Cathal,

239
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,700
...is not to break speed limits.

240
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:19,678
Fancy yourself as a bit of a driver then, do you?

241
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,974
I am driving.

242
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,790
No, I'm talking control.

243
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,990
They said I'd never learn anything.
Alright, you try.

244
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,035
I couldn't do that!

245
00:35:03,035 --> 00:35:05,535
Just turn into the corner, up with the handbrake
and that's it.

246
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,430
But what if I do the handbrake at the wrong time?

247
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,668
Unless you hit something, it'll just spin out.

248
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,550
Spin out? Spin down the mountain!

249
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,550
-Get into the car!
-No!

250
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:47,010
Evel fucking Knievel, I give ye!

251
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,413
Fuck!

252
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,717
You alright?

253
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,835
What the fuck was that?

254
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,536
That was great.

255
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,289
You're fuckin' turning into the corner...
I thought you were a goner man!

256
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,709
Do it again!

257
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,250
Can I try that?

258
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,050
Coming over to the wild side?

259
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,679
Just curious.

260
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,855
Thank you.

261
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,750
I nearly got married once.

262
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:32,875
Yeah?

263
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,390
Charlotte.

264
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,618
She never said why she finished us.

265
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,017
She just left and that was that.

266
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,358
Is there anything in that book of yours about her?

267
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,552
Maybe.

268
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,014
"In the middle of the journey of life

269
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,416
I was in a dark wood...

270
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,949
for I had lost the true path."

271
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,013
What's the rest of it?

272
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,051
Tell you some other time.

273
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,055
Mr. Mysterious.

274
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:54,316
It's like a city of fireworks that have all exploded at once.

275
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:04,000
My Da brought all of us to a fireworks display one time.

276
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,354
Great day, that.

277
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,055
Have you ever seen a leaf fall off a tree?

278
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:21,855
What?

279
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,898
Have you ever seen the actual moment when a leaf

280
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,793
breaks from its branch?

281
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:38,258
No, I can't say that I have

282
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,232
It's a beautiful thing.

283
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,419
-How many's that now?
-Seven.

284
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,075
No way!

285
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,473
-That's eight now.
-Cathal, even if it was eight...

286
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:26,518
...eight laps of this place is only a quarter of a mile.

287
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,579
Like to see you try it.

288
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,072
At my age, this is my excercise.

289
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,234
-Here you go.
-Oh, thanks.

290
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,002
Geez, look at you.

291
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:58,410
A few laps around here and you're like death warmed up.

292
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,799
I look alright.

293
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,713
You know, you're never gonna get out of here
unless you quit that stuff.

294
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,051
You're never gonna listen, are you?

295
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,094
Fuck it! I'm kickin' it.

296
00:41:16,696 --> 00:41:18,677
I am kickin' it for good!

297
00:41:23,805 --> 00:41:25,239
Oh... What's Peter doing here?

298
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,035
It's a bit early for dinner.

299
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,036
Hey guys!

300
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,254
Alright?

301
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,254
Look Fred... I was just talking to them,

302
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,254
the reality it seems is you're never gonna be 
high enough up the list to get a place

303
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,254
unless we can do something about it.
Now I was speaking to a friend of mine

304
00:41:41,254 --> 00:41:43,754
his wife works for one of the daily newspapers.

305
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,254
I don't think I like where this is going.
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,775
Look Fred, you know me I wouldn't
steer you wrong.

306
00:41:47,775 --> 00:41:50,831
If we can get an article written about you
living in a car.

307
00:41:50,831 --> 00:41:52,629
Fred, you'd be quids in.

308
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,878
What about Jules?

309
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,673
Just tell her now. Fred you can't pass this up.

310
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,036
Alright. Alright.

311
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,068
I'll go and get things going.

312
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,368
I don't know about this.

313
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,568
-Have you ever been in the papers?
-Yeah, once.

314
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,668
I won't ask what for.

315
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,055
She's good.

316
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,355
She must be giving a lesson.

317
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,355
So are you gonna tell her?

318
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,055
What do you think?

319
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,155
Play it again.

320
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,113
Stop looking!

321
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,276
Is that you, Fred?

322
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,298
I thought it was you.

323
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,054
-Hello.
-We were just passing and...

324
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,276
...we heard the music.

325
00:43:37,276 --> 00:43:39,100
Come in for coffee.

326
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,435
Isn't there somebody in there with you?

327
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,993
A pupil, but we're almost finished.

328
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,550
You can wait in the living room.

329
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,355
Come on!

330
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,569
He's gone. Coffee?

331
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:08,769
That would be very nice, thank you.

332
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,069
He's very good, isn't he?

333
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:13,269
Oh, yes, he is.

334
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,769
I tried the piano once.

335
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,069
Oh, did you enjoy it?

336
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,369
You know, I have one at home.

337
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:29,769
Ahm... uhm... 
I never really get to play it though.

338
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,069
I don't think Cathal is umm...

339
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,969
...really, very passionate about the piano.

340
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,569
Really, are you, Cathal?

341
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,269
Is that a question, Fred?

342
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,369
Maybe, maybe... I'll just put on the kettle.

343
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,569
Jules, let me give you a hand with that.

344
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,110
Oh, it doesn't work, Fred.

345
00:45:16,660 --> 00:45:18,771
Hasn't for years.

346
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,276
It stopped sometime after
my husband, Liam died.

347
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,693
Whoa...

348
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:26,538
...you've been everywhere.

349
00:45:26,638 --> 00:45:28,809
I used to tour with a small chamber orchestra.

350
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,238
It brough us all over the world.

351
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,829
Fascinating.

352
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,814
You know, you should let Fred
have a look at that for ya. 

353
00:45:40,570 --> 00:45:42,014
He fixes clocks.

354
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,014
She could bring it around your place Fred, couldn't she?

355
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:49,014
I couldn't impose like that.

356
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:53,014
Nonsense, Fred's not married.
You don't mind, Fred, do ya?

357
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:59,514
I'm sorry guys.

358
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,090
Just a moment.
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,000
-If you continue to tell her to come around 
my place...

359
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,919
-Well, can you fix it or not?
-Of course I can fix it.

360
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:10,749
Bye, bye.

361
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:14,235
What was all that mumbo-jumbo on the phone about?

362
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,511
Mind you, it was a nice accent 
and she has nice legs too.

363
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,399
I suppose you think you're funny, do you?

364
00:46:21,905 --> 00:46:25,752
-Inviting her around my place.
-I was just doing you a favour.

365
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:29,029
She'll be really impressed
of my life style won't she?

366
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,390
Hey! She just gave one druggie and
one homeless person tea and biscuits in her own house.

367
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,295
Don't ever underestimate yourself!

368
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,508
It's hard not to...

369
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,849
...when you're living in your car.

370
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:45,249
If you got yourself a house, she'd never have to know, would she?

371
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,749
I can't even get the dole.

372
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:50,249
Highly likely to get myself a place to live.

373
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,313
Look! Fred!

374
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:56,798
You need to forget about your fucking
pride and focus on the system.

375
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,473
The system...

376
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,473
See that?

377
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,873
"Helping you to help yourself."

378
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,473
-Gentlemen.
-Hello.

379
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:46,073
You were refused because you
have no fixed abode.

380
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,473
I have...

381
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,673
...I had then and still have accommodation.

382
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,673
We did consider, and still don't 
accept a car as a fixed abode.

383
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,473
-He sleeps in it.
-That may be so.

384
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,909
But until you get into a hostel
or get a bed somewhere, our hands are tied.

385
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:05,491
Can I ask you about the travellers?

386
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,997
Now I would like to point out,

387
00:48:07,997 --> 00:48:12,049
the travellers live in their
caravans, not just on halting sites,

388
00:48:12,049 --> 00:48:14,348
but also on the side of the road.

389
00:48:14,348 --> 00:48:17,875
And yet... they are entitled to assistence.

390
00:48:17,875 --> 00:48:22,035
-They're a minority group.
-And we're not?

391
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:27,035
If this office is not in a position
to send correspondence to an invidual,

392
00:48:27,035 --> 00:48:31,035
then we have have to assume,
that that individual is of no fixed abode.

393
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,035
So that... is the reason 

394
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:37,035
why travellers are categorised
by this office as not being homeless?

395
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:37,835
Yes.

396
00:48:44,835 --> 00:48:47,635
Mr. Fred Daly
Mazda 626

397
00:48:47,635 --> 00:48:51,310
The car park, Coast Road, Dublin.

398
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:53,312
I also have a signed receipt

399
00:48:53,312 --> 00:48:55,711
If you'd like to see it.

400
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,856
I assume I'll now be put into payment?

401
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,428
Get the fucker out of the car.

402
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:33,814 
I'm bleeding trying.

403
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:41,314
You think you can take me
for a prick, do you?

404
00:49:46,428 --> 00:49:47,954
Robbo, burn the car out.

405
00:49:50,428 --> 00:49:52,414
-The bleeding lighter isn't working.
-Give it to me.

406
00:49:53,428 --> 00:49:54,614
I swear, Frank, no.

407
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,515
I'm sorry, I just, I needed the hit.

408
00:49:57,516 --> 00:49:59,515
They're bleeding Pepsi lighters, those.

409
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,513
Now who's this clown?

410
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,275
-Are you alright, Cathal?
-Go back to your car, Fred!

411
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,113
I'm getting fucking seasick lookin' at this guy.

412
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,759
-Who are these people, Cathal?
-You talk to me, not him.

413
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,651
Is this the drug dealer...

414
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:24,009
...that you owe money to?

415
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,490
Are you fuckin' touched, are you?

416
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:31,849
If you wanna talk, this joker 
owes me 600 euro.

417
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:33,510
So unless you've got something for me...

418
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,436
...why don't you piss off back to your
poxy little car and let me get on with my 
business, yeah?

419
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,453
I have something for you.

420
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,592
Oh yeah?

421
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,292
It's in the car.

422
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:49,692
We're not going anywhere.

423
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:56,892
Good man.

424
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:23,034
-Here you go. It's not much.
-How much?

425
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,313
A couple of hundred.

426
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,895
You see Robbo?

427
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:33,677
Someone's taking me seriously.

428
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,915
Now fuck off!

429
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,860
Do you see what you draw on yourself
when you mess with drugs?

430
00:51:58,210 --> 00:52:02,028
I'm giving up.
I swear, Fred, I'm giving up.

431
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:06,311
Talk is cheap, Cathal.

432
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,311
Bruce Lee or what!

433
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,511
That was amazing last night.

434
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:29,911
Where did you get the moves?

435
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,911
Sometimes, you can be a terrible eejit.
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,900
Fred, he's a kung-fu master,
00:53:14,911 --> 00:53:18,690
if you see him with a torch you better run faster!
00:53:19,00 --> 00:53:22,000
Call Fred if you're in dread...

436
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:28,611
You never told me he's such a great singer.

437
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:31,011
He's always amazing me.

438
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:35,211
-You should join the choir here.
-Not really sure that's my thing.

439
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,211
What are you doing here?

440
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,211
I just came in to rehearse.

441
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:42,911
Sure you can rehearse any time.

442
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:46,311
-Let's go for a walk.
-A walk?

443
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,911
-Where?
-Trust me.

444
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,911
What happened to his face?

445
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,811
Oh, don't ask.

446
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,911
Do you live close by, Cathal?

447
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,211
Not too far away.

448
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,211
Actually, I'm a neighbour of Fred's.

449
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:11,511
-Let's go this way, by the cars.
-No, let's go this way... I'm getting cold.

450
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:14,011
Come on!

451
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,811
It's 2:27, I have to meet someone.

452
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:21,311
-I'll see you two later.
-See you Cathal.

453
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,511
Good throw!

454
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:37,211
Thanks.

455
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,111
I probably have too much time on my hands.

456
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:44,211
Is that your life story?

457
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,011
When I was away,

458
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,211
I drifted from job to job...
I was a jeweller, I worked in a book shop.

459
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:59,395
You name it, I probably did it.

460
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,114
It's good to try different things.

461
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,114
Do you write your own music?

462
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,614
I used to.

463
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,114
I just remember it being easier.

464
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:16,414
That's the way it is with 
a lot of things for me these days.

465
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,514
You know, Fred.

466
00:55:29,514 --> 00:55:33,500
You always seem to be a guy
with a lot on his mind.

467
00:55:45,514 --> 00:55:49,500
What if I call around to your place tomorrow 
and try to fix that clock on your mantlepiece?

468
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:52,500
I would like that.

469
00:55:56,714 --> 00:55:58,500
You can make me tea in return.

470
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:03,799
Is that a date then?

471
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,799
I'm too old for dates!

472
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,553
That's brilliant!

473
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,856
It's working again.

474
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:07,393
It's a beautiful old clock.

475
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:10,432
Must be well over fifty years old, is it?

476
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,253
The older ones have real character.

477
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:16,632
All it needed...

478
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:21,110
...was a good cleaning and a bit of a nudge
to spring back into life.

479
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,710
Do you miss your husband?

480
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,110
Well...

481
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,510
Liam and I had some great times...

482
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,810
...we even travelled to India in a campervan.

483
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:11,410
I just thought it would never end.

484
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,733
And in a second, your life can change.

485
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:20,113
Did I see you and Cathal in a car the other day?

486
00:58:24,790 --> 00:58:26,713
Are you doing anything tomorrow night, Jules?

487
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,113
Nothing special.

488
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,113
Meet me in the seaside car park at eight.

489
00:58:34,890 --> 00:58:36,313
The car park?

490
00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:39,913
It's very important.

491
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:41,513
Okay.

492
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,718
Looks good! I will do mine tomorrow.

493
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,029
I need a break.

494
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:10,710
Okay I'm heading to town for a ramble.

495
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,755
You coming?

496
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,373
Ah... no, go ahead yourself.

497
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,435
Fred!

498
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,270
Fred!

499
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:17,312
-Hold up!
-"I don't inject," huh?

500
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,570
"I'm not like that scumbags, oh no!"

501
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:24,479
-That sound familiar? Ringin' any bells?
-Fred, it's just that...

502
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:29,052
I... I trusted you!

503
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,258
And now I find you injecting.

504
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,958
You probably always did.

505
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:38,358
-Look, Fred.
-Enough!

506
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:48,328
Hello?

507
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,275
Anybody there?

508
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,918
No friend today now.

509
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,949
See if there's anything in the car.

510
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,292
And turn the music up.

511
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,456
It's like a bleeding pigsty in there.

512
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,240
I told you once. There will be no more. 

513
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:38,439
I tried, Frank. I did, I swear Frank, I tried.

514
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:45,830
Get up!

515
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:49,830
Get up!

516
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:16,775

517
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,975
It was like this when I got back a few hours ago.

518
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,690
I caught him injecting.

519
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:52,730
He swore to me he never did that.

520
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:58,052
He even showed me his arms
and they were always clean.

521
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,311
He injects in the veins in his feet.

522
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,671
-But the car... who?
-I think he owes some guy money and...

523
01:06:07,071 --> 01:06:09,918
I don't know what to... should we call the police?

524
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:13,618
Look, Fred. Let's just focus on this for now.
We'll worry about Cathal later.

525
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:14,958
They're here, now get yourself together.

526
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,576
-Fred, I presume.
-Hi, I'm Peter.

527
01:06:20,580 --> 01:06:22,878
Nice to meet you. What happened?

528
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:26,210
Well... it's, it's very complicated,
you see I, I...

529
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:29,035
These are the dangers of living on the street.

530
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:31,319
Umm, this happened...

531
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:34,874
-Earlier today.
-Do you know the people who did it?

532
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:39,348
No... no I can't say I do.

533
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:55,750
Thanks, Peter.

534
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,695
Some of your druggie buddies caught up with your face?

535
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:05,005
Look dad...

536
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,695
...I need six hundred.

537
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:13,395
If I don't get the money, it'll be a box for me.

538
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,695
Well?

539
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:28,995
Will you fucking answer me?

540
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,495
You've done too much to me.

541
01:09:40,420 --> 01:09:42,495
There's no more to give.

542
01:09:43,120 --> 01:09:44,695
Ma would've.

543
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:51,495
You broke her heart.

544
01:09:54,220 --> 01:09:56,195
Then she couldn't live.

545
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:00,195
Cancer had nothing to do with it at all, no?

546
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,695
Goodbye, dad.

547
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,695
Excuse me, I'm looking for this man.
Has he been here today?

548
01:11:04,695 --> 01:11:07,695
Have you seen this man?
Cathal O'Reagan.

549
01:11:10,595 --> 01:11:12,695
Have you seen him today?

550
01:11:41,195 --> 01:11:44,795
-Looking to score, man?
-Got anything?

551
01:11:46,695 --> 01:11:48,695
Like some of this, would ya?

552
01:11:49,295 --> 01:11:51,095
Leave this stupid fucker.

553
01:12:12,540 --> 01:12:16,000
I'll give you the wrap, but we
have to take your shoes, yea?

554
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:38,392
Come on you stupid fucker,
we're gonna miss all the bleeding fireworks.

555
01:12:40,220 --> 01:12:42,539
No, wait... Help...

556
01:14:25,220 --> 01:14:26,088
Hello. Can I help you?

557
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:29,588
I'm looking for Cathal,
Cathal O'Reagan.

558
01:14:30,020 --> 01:14:31,588
Mr. O'Reagan is ready inside.

559
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:34,588
Thank you.

560
01:15:39,020 --> 01:15:41,188
In the middle of the journey of life

561
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,755
I was in a dark wood...

562
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,755
...for I'd lost the true path.

563
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:56,255
And so...

564
01:15:58,000 --> 01:15:59,555
...we came forth...

565
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:04,036
...and once again, beheld the stars..."

566
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:24,036
Thanks, Cathal.

567
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,736

568
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:17,915
I'm sorry, Jules.

569
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:21,915
I... should've told you.

570
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:24,559
It's okay, Fred.

571
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,235
You don't have to explain.

572
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:28,995
It was...

573
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:32,535
It was so complicated.
01:17:37,680 --> 01:17:41,000
Fred, I'm really sorry about Cathal,
you know that?

574
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:43,935
Yes, I do.

575
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:55,535
The night we were to meet in the car park,
I planned to tell you.

576
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:01,335
But then... Cathal went missing.

577
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,695
Fred, I decided to go home.

578
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,035
To Helsinki.

579
01:18:18,820 --> 01:18:21,278
Just to see how I feel about things.

580
01:18:23,480 --> 01:18:26,278
-For how long?
-I don't know.

581
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,458
When will you know?

582
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:36,393
When I'm there for a while I guess.

583
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:01,395
Hello.

584
01:19:03,020 --> 01:19:07,689
I've come to... pay my...
to Cathal's family.

585
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,191
You are?

586
01:19:09,780 --> 01:19:11,891
My name is Frederick Daly.

587
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:14,191
That suppose to mean something to me?

588
01:19:14,780 --> 01:19:16,191
I was a friend of Cathal's.

589
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:25,391
Thank you.

590
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:33,691
Drink?

591
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:35,691
No, thanks.

592
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,191
Is Cathals's father here?

593
01:19:41,880 --> 01:19:43,091
Yeah... the kitchen.

594
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:10,318
George... is it?

595
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:14,594
My name is Frederick Daly.

596
01:20:15,140 --> 01:20:16,550
I was a friend of Cathal's.

597
01:20:18,930 --> 01:20:20,070
I don't know you.

598
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,555
No... we... we lived together.

599
01:20:22,755 --> 01:20:24,909
Well, we lived close to each other.

600
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,399
I had nothing to do with drugs.

601
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:31,009
We just became friends.

602
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,599
Thanks for coming.

603
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,399
George I...

604
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:45,399
...I came here to...

605
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,599
...actually I'm not sure why I came...

606
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:55,599
...you see Cathal meant an awful lot to me.

607
01:20:57,120 --> 01:20:58,599
And I know...

608
01:20:58,599 --> 01:21:02,899
... I do know that deep down, he
never meant to hurt you the way he did.

609
01:21:06,599 --> 01:21:08,299
Maybe so.

610
01:21:09,599 --> 01:21:10,999
He was a good lad.

611
01:21:11,299 --> 01:21:12,899
You don't think I know that?

612
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:20,599
Listen George, what went on between
you and him, that's your business.

613
01:21:21,599 --> 01:21:23,299
I didn't come to talk about that.

614
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:25,699
Why did you come?

615
01:21:28,599 --> 01:21:30,899
I just... wanted to let you know that...

616
01:21:32,009 --> 01:21:34,799
...to me... Cathal was a friend.

617
01:21:39,009 --> 01:21:41,199
He... he made me see things that...

618
01:21:42,909 --> 01:21:45,699
...I thought I'd never see again.

619
01:21:46,809 --> 01:21:50,899
Then the Cathal you knew and the one I did of late
were obviously two very different people.

620
01:21:52,709 --> 01:21:54,599
Look... thank you...

621
01:21:55,000 --> 01:21:57,235
...for saying that and for coming and all.

622
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:01,035
But it was his life...

623
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,235
...and I certainly couldn't change it.

624
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:09,635
Maybe if his mother was here...

625
01:22:14,900 --> 01:22:16,835
I'm sorry George, one more thing...

626
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,735
...I think this is yours.

627
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,735
I know that Cathal treasured it...

628
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:26,735
...I fixed it for him.

629
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,735
You should have it.

630
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,835
I'm sorry again about Cathal.

631
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:55,335
Who was that, dad?

632
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,815
Nobody.
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,800
