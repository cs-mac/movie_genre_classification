1
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,315
THE WAVE

2
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,756
Making sure the kids
don't smoke in the yard, huh?

3
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,274
Hi, honey.

4
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,199
Hey, rocker!

5
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,590
Teachers are lazy, remember!

6
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,513
Just doing some copying.
You seen Mrs Kohlhage?

7
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,795
No, why?

8
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,393
She was looking for you.

9
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,118
Better see what she wants.

10
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,352
Autocracy?
I'm teaching the anarchy class.

11
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,596
Mr Wieland showed me his outline.
It's well thought-out.

12
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,678
- I'd have done mine this weekend.
- A bit late.

13
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,392
Wieland? Wieland doesn't have
a clue about it.

14
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,709
I studied in Berlin.

15
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,075
I squatted in Kreuzberg for five years.

16
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,829
May 1st demonstrations.
I'm an expert.

17
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,353
If it's that important,
ask Mr Wieland to trade.

18
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,308
Couldn't you...?

19
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,352
Work it out between yourselves.

20
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,394
Mr Wieland?

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,989
Mr Wenger.

22
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,954
- About the project subjects...
- What?

23
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,238
Could you trade with me?
I'm doing autocracy.

24
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,393
<i>Alea iacta est.</i>

25
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,308
The die is cast.

26
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,715
You know I wanted to do anarchy.

27
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:33,949
A bit too much!

28
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,432
Project week

29
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,558
is for showing the students
the virtues of democracy.

30
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,074
How to make Molotov cocktails

31
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,710
belongs in chemistry class.
If at all.

32
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,032
I loved you. You betrayed me.

33
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,158
But I haven't forgotten
my dream of life, love and trust,

34
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,153
the dream that once was real.

35
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,231
I will build it with my fortune

36
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,358
by destroying you.

37
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,030
Hey, thanks for the daisies, babe.

38
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,673
They'll look great
when I'm lying in the box.

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,717
He's making a fool of himself.

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,999
Know what I'm sayin', babe?

41
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,430
"I'll take you
to Capri in your coffin..."

42
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,433
- He's saying it wrong.
- It's what I want to say.

43
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,554
Ferdi, can't we do it right through
for once?

44
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,833
You're the one who stopped.
First stage rule:

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,513
The show must go on!

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,356
Aren't we applying the play's
criticism of capitalism to today?

47
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,954
That's why I'm updating
the dialogue.

48
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,117
OK, but don't make a joke out of it.

49
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,748
He can't assert himself.

50
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,151
Yeah, we're doing Dürrenmatt,
not <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

51
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,196
Thank you for the wreaths,
chrysanthemums and roses...

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,994
dear sir!

53
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,875
That sounds like shit.
No way I'm saying that.

54
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,189
Forget it.

55
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,113
If Ferdi doesn't stick to his lines,
I can't do it.

56
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,034
I've had enough.
Are you coming?

57
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,676
It's a pity
they're not taking it seriously.

58
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,956
It's no use
if everybody does what they want.

59
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,558
Coming to the game today?

60
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,915
Lisa and I have to study for Spanish.

61
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,513
Not all afternoon?

62
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,716
What did you sign up for?

63
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,309
Sign up?

64
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,277
Project week.

65
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,590
- Are the lists up already?
- Sure.

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,194
- I was thinking of autocracy.
- Me too.

67
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,269
Gotta go.

68
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,916
- Will you sign me up?
- For what?

69
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,478
- Whatever you take.
- OK.

70
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,753
See you later.

71
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,279
I wanna see some grit.
Go and dominate!

72
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,588
Watch your defence
and counter man to man. Got it?

73
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,478
Eight minutes left. We can do it!

74
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,629
Marco,

75
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,792
that goes for you too.
Play as a team.

76
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,469
Let's go!

77
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,874
Mogli, move the ball up!

78
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,713
Nice, Marco!

79
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,959
Marco!

80
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,633
Sinan's wide open!

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,518
- Marco!
- Go for it!

82
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,874
Sinan's free!

83
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,030
What are you doing, damn it?

84
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,151
Sinan was wide open!

85
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,993
Don't you want to score?

86
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,879
Martin, you tell me...

87
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,789
What are we supposed
to rebel against nowadays?

88
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,030
Nothing means anything anymore.

89
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,158
We all just want to have fun.

90
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,437
What our generation lacks

91
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,989
is a common goal to unite us.

92
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:46,799
That'd just be the Zeitgeist.
Look around.

93
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,554
The most Googled name
on the Internet

94
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,638
is Paris Fucking Hilton!

95
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,994
No shit.

96
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,078
No shit.

97
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,353
Stolte.

98
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,999
You got the dope today?

99
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,149
Sure I do.

100
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,710
- This is the real thing?
- Sure is.

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,389
A buddy brought it from Holland.

102
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,389
Are you nuts,
carrying that much dope?

103
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,153
Cops have to catch me first.

104
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,438
What do you want for it?

105
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,149
- Nothing.
- What?

106
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,955
It's free for you.
You're my homeys.

107
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,069
MONDAY

108
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,749
Baby.

109
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,594
The water's great.
60 degrees.

110
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,397
Don't you want to go for a swim?

111
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,153
It'd do you good.

112
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,639
Maybe later.

113
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,514
How's your shoulder?

114
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,669
It's OK now.

115
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,558
Don't overdo it.

116
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,429
Yeah, sure.

117
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,475
Coffee?

118
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,471
Sure, thanks.

119
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,915
Morning.

120
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,874
What's up?

121
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,837
- OK, Rainer?
- Yeah.

122
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,038
- Morning, Rainer.
- Sinan.

123
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,795
I have to say

124
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,633
I'm surprised so many of you
are interested in autocracy.

125
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,597
I'd have chosen anarchy.

126
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,593
- Lame Wieland?
- Your words, not mine!

127
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,073
So...

128
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,276
Autocracy. What does it mean?

129
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,355
Come on,
you signed up for this topic,

130
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,317
you must have certain expectations.

131
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,631
No hassles, I hope.

132
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,477
Jens, what do we mean
by autocratic government?

133
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,438
- Stuff like monarchy, I guess.
- Not necessarily.

134
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,238
Ferdi, what can you think of?

135
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,630
Autos that are crass!

136
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,836
That was pretty lame.

137
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,673
- Lisa, don't let me down.
- Dictatorship, maybe?

138
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,239
That's part of it. Karo?

139
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,151
I think autocracy is when

140
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,788
an individual or group
rules the masses.

141
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,995
Right.

142
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,789
Autocracy comes from the Greek
and means self-rule.

143
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:59,635
From <i>auto</i>, "self",
and <i>kratia</i>, "power", "rule"...

144
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,792
In an autocracy,

145
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,520
the ruler or rulers
have unlimited power

146
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,796
to change the law as they like.

147
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,871
Can you think of any examples?

148
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,795
Come on, a dictatorship!

149
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,554
- The Third Reich.
- Not again.

150
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,473
I didn't pick the topic,

151
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,200
but we have to get
through this week together.

152
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,351
I printed out some things for you.

153
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,953
All that stuff again?

154
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,553
It's an important topic.

155
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
The Nazis sucked.
All right, we get it!

156
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,359
And it's never gonna happen
here again.

157
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,873
What about Neo-Nazis?

158
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,508
We can't feel guilty forever.

159
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,959
We're not talking about guilt.
It's a historical responsibility.

160
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,151
Me a Turk, man!

161
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,113
- OK, we all know!
- What do we know?

162
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,236
Except
for some idiot East Germans...

163
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,152
Hey, I'm from the East!

164
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,231
You know. Skinheads.

165
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,311
- Can't we do something else?
- Like?

166
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,879
The Bush administration.

167
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,315
Wait, this is interesting.

168
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,677
You think another dictatorship
would be impossible in Germany?

169
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,398
We're way beyond that.

170
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,756
Marco, what do you think?

171
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,953
Beats me.

172
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,518
We'll take a ten-minute break.

173
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,837
What's the deal?

174
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,517
I changed the seating.
Now there's more room for everyone.

175
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,350
Fortunately, we can do
whatever we want during project week.

176
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,589
I propose we loosen things up a bit.
Any objections?

177
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,555
Very good.

178
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,594
What are the requirements
for an autocratic system?

179
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,988
Dennis?

180
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,595
- An ideology.
- Good. What else?

181
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,751
- Control.
- Surveillance.

182
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,117
You're getting
ahead of yourselves.

183
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,838
Unhappiness.

184
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,268
Interesting.

185
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,555
What does every dictatorship need?
We already mentioned it.

186
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,399
A <i>Führer</i>, man!

187
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,834
A <i>Führer?</i>

188
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,718
A word with lots of baggage.

189
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,713
But every dictatorship
has a central figure.

190
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,713
Let's go through this.
Who would that be here?

191
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,598
- You, the teacher.
- Me?

192
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,749
Who else?

193
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,150
One of you, for a change.

194
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,591
I'll be the leader.

195
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,076
No way! Rainer, you do it.

196
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,074
Let's vote.

197
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,708
Who wants me as your project leader?

198
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,038
- What is this?
- Play along.

199
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,632
Who's against? Any nays?

200
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,433
Abstentions?

201
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,080
- Good.
- Heil Rainer!

202
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,193
Of course, a leader deserves respect.

203
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,957
So you'll address me as Mr Wenger
for project week.

204
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,192
- Mr Wenger...
- Is he a megalomaniac now?

205
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,669
We just voted on it, didn't we?

206
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,274
- East German commie!
- Get with the programme!

207
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,590
Don't tell me what to do, bitch!

208
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,154
Watch your mouth, scumbag!

209
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,995
Quiet!
Clear off your desks.

210
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:39,149
From now on,
no one talks without permission.

211
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,676
- Yes, sir!
- Did I give you permission?

212
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,234
If you want to speak,
you'll stand up first.

213
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,114
- Isn't that going a bit far?
- Mona?

214
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,349
Isn't that going a bit far,
Mr Wenger?

215
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,919
- Feel anything?
- What?

216
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,071
Standing up gets your circulation going.

217
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,993
It's blood pressure.
If you stand up,

218
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,958
you wake up
and your concentration improves.

219
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,589
Sit down again.

220
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,111
Marco. You're tired from training,

221
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,357
but try sitting up straight.

222
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,353
Straighten your spine,
place your feet parallel

223
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,318
and breathe deeply.

224
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:20,708
Feel the difference?

225
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,828
Marco.

226
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,319
Yes, Mr Wenger.
It's better.

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,958
That's right,
you can breathe better.

228
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,234
Let's all do the same.
Everybody get up.

229
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,955
- Come on!
- What is this?

230
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,351
Breathe deeply.

231
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,353
Up you get.

232
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,078
Breathe in

233
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,033
and out.

234
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,911
- What's with you?
- No way!

235
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,672
Then leave, please.

236
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,877
No one's forcing you to stay.
Attendance is voluntary.

237
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,151
- Rainer, be cool.
- Mr Wenger.

238
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:06,270
Kevin, it's very simple.
Either play along or leave.

239
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:09,989
Well?

240
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,231
This is weirding me out.

241
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,519
Come on, Sinan.

242
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:28,829
Later daze!

243
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,671
You can sit down again.

244
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,959
What else is important
for a dictatorship?

245
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,754
- Discipline, Mr Wenger.
- Very good, Tim.

246
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,392
Discipline is power.

247
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,831
Let's go shoot some pool.

248
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,072
I've got a better idea.

249
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,150
Dude, what's that?
What happened to your M-class?

250
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,357
It's my mom's.
An anniversary present.

251
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,432
V-8, 250 bhp, 150 mph.

252
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,793
Wanna take this baby
for a spin on the Autobahn?

253
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,953
What's with you?

254
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,316
- I'm not coming.
- What do you mean?

255
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,074
I'm going back.

256
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,471
Have you totally lost it?

257
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,232
I've already failed twice.

258
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,109
You know what happens
if I don't graduate?

259
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,949
You're no honours student either.

260
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,557
I'm glad you changed your mind.

261
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,512
Have a seat in the back.

262
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,510
Thanks... Mr Wenger.

263
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,194
We were discussing

264
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,353
which social conditions
favour a dictatorship.

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,149
Lisa?

266
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,516
Which social conditions
are necessary?

267
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,432
Could you speak up, please?

268
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,033
Well, like, if there's injustice.

269
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,634
And, like, people don't know...

270
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,950
I mean, no jobs. And stuff.

271
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,190
Hey, Jens, what's the big idea?

272
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,716
Lisa, have a seat.

273
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,232
Take a deep breath.

274
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,752
Think what you're going to say.
Keep your answer short.

275
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,558
You can do it.

276
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,068
Try it again. OK?

277
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,509
High unemployment and social injustice.

278
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,389
Excellent. High unemployment
and social injustice

279
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,472
certainly would favour
a dictatorship.

280
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,589
Tim?

281
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,273
High inflation, Mr Wenger.

282
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,634
Good. Inflation.

283
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,030
- Political disillusionment.
- Very good, Karo.

284
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,428
Nationalism.

285
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,799
We saw it during the World Cup,
there were German flags everywhere.

286
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,109
But that was great!

287
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,474
I thought it was revolting.

288
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,790
That's what rocked
about the World Cup!

289
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,037
If Germans can't be proud
of their country, like anyone else,

290
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,156
itjust leads to the reverse,

291
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,191
to hatred of everybody else.

292
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,115
I think Mona means extreme nationalism.
Can we agree on that?

293
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,235
That was awesome today.
Thank you.

294
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,588
Mr Wenger?

295
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,957
After class call me Rainer again.

296
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,872
I really enjoyed it today.

297
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,837
Keep up your contributions.

298
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,515
Yes sir, Mr Wenger!

299
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,509
Watch it!

300
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,511
Why don't you watch it?

301
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,954
Be nice to your sister.

302
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,758
Just gimme a light!

303
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:47,514
- You shouldn't smoke.
- My dad says I can.

304
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,715
I've got a light.

305
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,348
Torsten just said it's up to you.

306
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,075
None of your business, anyway.

307
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,310
Ignore the little weirdo.

308
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,192
- Retard!
- You're the retard!

309
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,038
Don't you have a home
of your own?

310
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,194
Hi, hon.

311
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,839
Hi, sweetie.

312
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,069
You thirsty, too?

313
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,235
Aren't you going to ask me
how it went?

314
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,839
How did it go?

315
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,429
It was totally fascinating.

316
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,070
Mr Wenger taught us
how to sit right.

317
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,231
Upright, with your spine straight.

318
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,518
You know when you stand up quickly
and your vision goes all blurry?

319
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,432
That's because your pulse is low.

320
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,398
More roast?

321
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,712
Now we have to stand up to speak.
It's good for your circulation.

322
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,916
And keep our answers to the point.

323
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,509
Good. Why don't you, then?

324
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,670
There was this bizarre energy.
Everybody was caught up in it.

325
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,273
"Bizarre" is right.

326
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,839
What's that supposed to mean?

327
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,911
"Discipline is power"...

328
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:15,392
Karo, honey,
that's not how we raised you.

329
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,757
Maybe you should have.
Leon could use a bit of discipline.

330
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,991
He needs to learn his own limits.

331
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,718
It doesn't work for everyone.

332
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,589
Why?

333
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,512
I kicked Kevin out of class.

334
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,954
I'll kick your ass!

335
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,510
Get off it! Rainer's cool.

336
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:37,037
- You traitor!
- I'd have kicked you out too.

337
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,272
Besides, Rainer didn't kick you out.
Mr Wenger did.

338
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,599
He's always dissed me

339
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,354
'cause I'm not
in his faggy water-polo team.

340
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,272
What do you guys do there?

341
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,716
We practise hard.
I don't know why we're losing.

342
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,074
We have to beat Ernst Barlach High,
or we'll lose our league standing.

343
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,589
Come by sometime.

344
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,474
When's your next game?

345
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,159
Marco, let's go to my room.

346
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,513
We're watching the race.

347
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,717
We can watch it in my room.

348
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,156
We have our project assignment.

349
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,790
- What assignment?
- Are you coming?

350
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,793
Sorry, Torsten.

351
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,630
You go do your project assignment.

352
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,830
Hey, my little honeybee.

353
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,313
What say we do
our own "project assignment"?

354
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,313
I hear role-playing
can be pretty stimulating.

355
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,789
I thought we were going
to do something else.

356
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,949
Here, check this out.

357
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,679
Here's where we'll go.

358
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,118
The hippest part of Barcelona.
Only seven stops to the soccer stadium.

359
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,115
Isn't it a bit far?

360
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:52,149
Seven stops?

361
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,949
Barcelona.

362
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,349
It's beautiful. Right on the sea.

363
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,999
An artist's city.

364
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,275
Wouldn't your family miss you?

365
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,998
They get on my nerves.

366
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,072
Torsten and Bine are cool.

367
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,231
Sometimes they're too cool for me.

368
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,678
Stop whining.

369
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,549
Come here.

370
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,631
I'm not in the mood.

371
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,956
You're not moving tomorrow.
What's the hurry?

372
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,998
I have to sign up soon.

373
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,108
Then sign up.

374
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:30,359
Come on. Don't go yet.

375
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,679
I've got practice.

376
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,879
Wait.

377
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,910
Not here. Come on.

378
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,398
What the hell was that?

379
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,389
What the hell's wrong with you?

380
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,151
- Listen, man...
- Leave me alone.

381
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,551
Let's play together. Everyone
will expect you to hog the ball.

382
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,429
I'll swim into the clear on the left
and pass back to you, OK?

383
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,035
Get out! Sülo, you play.

384
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,153
Nice, Marco!
That's better.

385
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,352
That was a real play.

386
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,039
Finally!

387
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,316
Hi, sweetie, I'm home.

388
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,233
What's going on?

389
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,669
I just want to print something.

390
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,833
Those two get old real fast.
A real couple of teachers.

391
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,911
Are we like that too?

392
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,274
What's all this for?

393
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,238
Just a few ideas
I want to try out tomorrow.

394
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,117
I have a few ideas too!

395
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,831
Only if you put on
your nurse costume.

396
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,149
We'll see.

397
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,117
How about an injection?

398
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,713
I've got an injection
that's all ready to go!

399
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,869
Really?

400
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,393
Let's see it, then.

401
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,072
TUESDAY

402
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,074
Here he comes.

403
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,389
Morning.

404
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,074
Good morning, Mr Wenger.

405
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,198
You're making fun of me, huh?

406
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,918
No.

407
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,952
Everybody stand up, please.

408
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,718
Now do as I do.

409
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,958
These are a few warm-up exercises

410
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,350
to loosen up your muscles.

411
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,156
Especially the legs.

412
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,158
And now in unison.

413
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,151
Left, right...

414
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,353
What's the big idea?

415
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,590
I want to show you something.

416
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,915
Good.

417
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,274
You feel it?

418
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,670
We're becoming a single unit.

419
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,400
That's the power of unity.

420
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,792
- How long do we keep this up?
- Until we're in step.

421
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,632
You know that from dancing, right?

422
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,711
Left, right...

423
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,673
A rhythm like this
can cause bridges to collapse.

424
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,553
- Kaschi, you're out of step.
- Chill, man!

425
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,712
I think we get it, Mr Wenger.

426
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,559
No, you don't.

427
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,714
- This exercise has another purpose.
- What's that?

428
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
Wieland's anarchy class
is below us.

429
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:42,276
I want the plaster to fall
off the ceiling onto our "enemy".

430
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,509
Excellent!

431
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,079
Have they gone crazy?

432
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,111
Unity is power.

433
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,397
You want to know
why I rearranged the seating?

434
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,994
To break up your usual cliques.

435
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,995
You all have your friends and groups.
That's important.

436
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,957
You can't
get through life all by yourself.

437
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,918
But together,
we are much, much stronger.

438
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,350
The new seating has a method to it.

439
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,351
Do you know what it is?

440
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,749
Anyone?

441
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,190
Karo, why are you sitting
next to Jens and not Marco?

442
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,949
Because Marco and I
distract each other?

443
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,519
Oh, do you?

444
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:37,552
Wieland down there
wants to foster his students

445
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,358
by making them Ione warriors.

446
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,512
You know what I mean.
No one letting the other copy.

447
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,309
I say that leads
to social Darwinism.

448
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,675
I'm convinced if we pull together,

449
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,592
we'll be much stronger.

450
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,592
So we can copy from each other?

451
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,156
If it means better grades, yes.

452
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,436
That's why I'm checking your grades,

453
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,160
and seating the good
next to the bad.

454
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,594
I want you to help each other.

455
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,159
That's total bull!

456
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,515
I don't believe it.

457
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,392
Please stand up.

458
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,789
You wouldn't embarrass us like this.

459
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,157
All the poor students
are lined up like ducks in a row.

460
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,388
I never said anything about
poor students. Just poor grades.

461
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,358
There are no poor students.

462
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,033
You're good in my class,

463
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,077
but you struggle in math.

464
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,115
Lisa, however, is a math whiz.

465
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,993
You can help each other.

466
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,875
And there's another advantage.

467
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,634
The whole class would do better.

468
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,030
Better than the anarchists downstairs.

469
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,799
I know it's unorthodox.

470
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,118
But why not try something new?

471
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,113
Hey, Tommy. Pretty loud, huh?

472
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,755
How's it going with Wieland,
our Bavarian?

473
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,988
I thought anarchy would be interesting.
But he just blows.

474
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,832
He's such a jerk.

475
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,231
If you guys hadn't raised hell,
I would've dozed off.

476
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:06,589
What was that?

477
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,990
A little calisthenics
to wake them up.

478
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,275
Calisthenics?

479
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,671
I thought the building
was going to collapse.

480
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,195
My students are outraged,
and justly so.

481
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:17,554
Can I help you kids?

482
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,508
We wanted to ask if we can switch
to the autocracy group.

483
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,318
Right away, if possible.

484
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,151
We were talking about group unity.

485
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,710
What are the signs of group unity?

486
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,159
Team spirit, Mr Wenger.

487
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,151
Good. But I meant visual signs.

488
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,796
- Dress, Mr Wenger?
- Correct.

489
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,792
A common way of dressing.

490
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,834
Uniformity, you could say.

491
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,428
Uniforms suck.

492
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,589
Dominik?

493
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:56,839
I mean,
uniforms are totally fascist.

494
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,150
Not necessarily military uniforms.

495
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:03,313
There are all kinds:
McDonald's, stewardesses, meter maids...

496
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,949
Even business suits
are a dress code.

497
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,510
Your outfit
is a kind of uniform too.

498
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,796
It indicates your social group.

499
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,873
Lisa?

500
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,276
Uniforms can serve another purpose.

501
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,510
They eliminate social differences.

502
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,672
But they eliminate individuality too.

503
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,831
Mona, would you stand up, please?

504
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,510
Lisa, would you explain that to us?

505
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:34,231
Well, I mean, we all stress out
every morning over what to wear.

506
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,631
If we all wore a uniform,
we wouldn't have to.

507
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,029
In Hamburg they're talking
about reintroducing school uniforms.

508
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,759
Does that make sense?

509
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,509
Sure, but they'd have to be
cheap enough for everyone to afford.

510
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,230
Marco, why don't you tell everybody?

511
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,999
I was saying...

512
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,633
The Knicks' Stephon Marbury

513
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,429
developed a basketball shoe
that costs $14.98,

514
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,192
the "Starbury One".

515
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,391
He's a ghetto kid and wanted a shoe
kids could afford,

516
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,232
instead of expensive Nike Airs.

517
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,313
A good example.
How can he market them so cheaply?

518
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,518
Because they're made
in Chinese prison camps.

519
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,629
No, they just do
without expensive ad campaigns.

520
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:28,837
Nike spends
hundreds of millions on ads.

521
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,594
David Beckham
got 80 million from Adidas.

522
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,828
What say we adopt a school uniform

523
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,956
for the duration of project week?

524
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,709
Like what?

525
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,599
A pair ofjeans, a white shirt.
Everyone has that.

526
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,200
- I don't have a white shirt.
- Then buy one.

527
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,396
I'm not spending money for that.

528
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,199
Come on, how much can it cost?

529
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,191
Jens, stand up, please.

530
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,559
I've got two.
You can have one of mine.

531
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,036
That's what I call team spirit!

532
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,997
Good for you!

533
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,199
It's decided, then.

534
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,833
- Two of the same?
- Right.

535
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,592
You already bought one.

536
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,154
That'll be 110 euros.

537
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,309
Thank you.

538
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:31,310
- Receipt?
- Don't worry about it.

539
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,556
These must really be hip.

540
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,994
That'll be 45, please.

541
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:55,109
Excuse me, but my things
may be in here, too.

542
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,512
Where are you going in that?

543
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,555
Why?

544
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,517
You look like a nun.

545
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,593
Well, I like it.

546
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,679
Where's your white shirt?

547
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,829
WEDNESDAY

548
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,069
I didn't like it.

549
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,437
- Why not?
- I just don't look good in white.

550
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:54,675
So that's it. Pure vanity again.

551
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,230
I don't have to explain
why I don't want to wear a dumb shirt!

552
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,557
That's just what Mr Wenger
was talking about.

553
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,312
Pure egoism.

554
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,274
Karo, we agreed.

555
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,873
Mind your own business!

556
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,152
She doesn't look good in white.

557
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,318
Good morning.

558
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,554
Mona has switched classes.

559
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:39,110
More newcomers.
We're definitely full now.

560
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,872
Go ahead and find a seat.

561
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,634
Jules and Frederik
wanted to join us too.

562
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,798
Full means full.

563
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,876
Now that we're so many,
we need a name, don't we?

564
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:54,237
Excellent. That was my next topic.
Any suggestions?

565
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,349
Terror Squad.

566
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,158
Serious suggestions only.

567
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,354
Visionary Club.

568
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,710
- The Wave.
- You would say that!

569
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,313
It's great. It fits.

570
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:10,869
True. Tim?

571
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,789
Tsunami.

572
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,438
That's overdoing it.

573
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,915
The Base.

574
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,229
The Pact.

575
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,948
The White Giant.

576
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,269
The Inner Circle.

577
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,429
The Risen.

578
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,230
- The Centre.
- That's good too.

579
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,796
Anyone else?

580
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,479
No one?

581
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,789
The Changers.

582
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,239
The Changers?

583
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,590
That's quite a few.
I'll write some down.

584
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,157
OK, last suggestion...
The Changers.

585
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,076
We have a winner.
From now on we are The Wave.

586
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,148
That's really good.

587
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,038
Helps me concentrate.
Honest.

588
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,998
I like it.
Why not design a logo for us?

589
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,629
- For real?
- Yes.

590
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,233
You design our logo.

591
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,119
That brings us to the next step.
Action is power.

592
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:35,876
What's the use of great ideas
if we don't actually do something?

593
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,478
I want everyone to contribute
to The Wave, for the greater good.

594
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,631
I'll set up a profile
on MySpace for us.

595
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,789
Great.

596
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,076
- I wanted to do that.
- Do it together.

597
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:49,113
No. I'd rather do something
on my own.

598
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,998
Why don't you make a website?

599
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,435
We can make buttons with the logo.

600
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,354
My aunt has a machine.

601
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,875
We could have tattoos. On our arms.

602
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,679
Postcards to hand out...

603
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:28,319
Hey, what's up?

604
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,999
A friend of mine is out of stash.

605
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,231
I heard you can get dope.

606
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,353
Hey, my money's good.

607
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,192
Go buy it on the street.

608
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,272
What's going down over there?

609
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,509
They're shaking down Stoltefuss.

610
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,035
I don't sell dope
to anarchist freaks.

611
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,795
What's that mean?

612
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,031
Check out his pretty shirt.
Mommy buy it for you?

613
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,679
Leave me alone, you fucks!

614
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,559
Hey, take it easy.
Everything's cool.

615
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,478
Is there a problem here?

616
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,672
- Two more weirdoes.
- What?

617
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,153
This a gang thing?

618
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,436
If you hassle Tim,
we'll kick your ass.

619
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,468
All right.

620
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,717
Fucking fascists.

621
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,355
Those anarchist freaks
tore my shirt.

622
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,239
Don't let those scumbags
push you around.

623
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,709
- You got my back.
- If we're not here?

624
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,791
Tim, listen,
let me give you my number.

625
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:45,589
If those fags hassle you,
you gimme a call, OK?

626
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,235
Sure.

627
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,352
What was that earlier?

628
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,033
I don't know,

629
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,159
she's angry about something.

630
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,910
I can't get through to her.

631
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,031
I've noticed that too, recently.

632
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,909
It bothers me
when she tells me what to do.

633
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,234
She makes plans
without bothering to ask me.

634
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,790
Why should I even follow her
to Spain?

635
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:23,232
Ten months from now
she'll have some guy

636
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,833
named Juan or Miguel

637
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,548
or whatever.

638
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,998
I'm scared I'll lose her.

639
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,037
Karo, this is Dennis. Where are you?
It's total chaos.

640
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,909
Call me back
when you get this message, OK?

641
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,792
- Voicemail.
- Like I said.

642
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,076
But she knows
we're rehearsing today.

643
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,598
No big loss.

644
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,469
I bet she's pissed off because
nobody voted for "The Changers".

645
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,553
I'm not sitting around all day
waiting for our little princess.

646
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,949
I'm with you.

647
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,389
Hey, wait a minute.

648
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,831
Lisa, I'm going too.

649
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,515
If you leave now, we can bag the play!
Is that what you want?

650
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:28,553
I think we can produce
something really great.

651
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,393
A play that means something.

652
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,555
Notjust entertainment,
but a message.

653
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,189
But not without Karo.

654
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,271
You wanted her to play the lead.

655
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,431
I was against
that consensus rule.

656
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,795
I thought we should have
real auditions.

657
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:46,315
We never really voted on it, anyway.

658
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:49,717
Could you all be quiet for a moment?

659
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:55,479
Let's do it the way I say.

660
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,471
Just once.

661
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,393
Your big break, Maja.
You're Claire Zachanassian.

662
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,549
Cool.

663
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,029
- And Lisa, you play Maja's role.
- Me?

664
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,633
Sure. You know the part.

665
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,119
Just go for it.

666
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,116
And Ferdi, stick to the text
and don't clown around for once, OK?

667
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:33,633
Man, I'm glad that day's over.

668
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,671
Rainer was doing
cool stuff with us.

669
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,477
You should join up again.
The Wave needs you, man.

670
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,357
How will that look?

671
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,637
You don't have to come to class.
You can still join.

672
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,476
Hey, let us have a go!

673
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,312
- What do you want?
- To skate!

674
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,837
You're that bitch Karo's brother.

675
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,595
- Got a problem with that?
- She's a cunt.

676
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,873
So what else is new?

677
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,991
The pipe belongs to The Wave.
You want to skate, you have to join.

678
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:19,512
<i>... sits</i> /<i>n the forest for the</i> /<i>ast time</i>,

679
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,559

680
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:26,429
Dennis said I was really good.

681
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,390
And now Maja has my role?

682
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,829
Well, it was just to try it out.

683
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,951
Where were you?

684
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,471
I wasn't feeling good.

685
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,595
And Ferdi's sticking to the text?

686
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,955
Dennis finally put his foot down.

687
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:53,029
You're all against me,
in your white shirts.

688
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,870
- Bull!
- But it's working now!

689
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,470
Just because we voted
against your name.

690
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:00,755
Excuse me?

691
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,195
You rub people up the wrong way.

692
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,475
Are you nuts?

693
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,315
Has it ever occurred to you
Marco may not want to go to Spain?

694
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,676
- Why do you say that?
- He told me.

695
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,157
What else did he tell you?

696
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:14,912
How often we make it?

697
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,517
You suck, you know that?

698
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,795
I suck?

699
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,713
What if I talked
to your boyfriend like that?

700
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:24,553
I don't have a boyfriend.

701
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,995
In case you hadn't noticed.

702
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,593
It's all about you.

703
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,269
You know what?

704
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,715
Maja was much better than you.

705
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:34,638
But you don't care about that.

706
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,395
You're pissed off
because you're not top dog in The Wave.

707
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,632
A shitty feeling, isn't it?
Get used to it!

708
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,635
Hi.

709
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,233
I want to show you something.
Look.

710
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,389
Here.

711
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:56,319
- What is it?
- Know what a slacker Kaschi is?

712
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,756
He made us a MySpace page.
Cool, huh!

713
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:01,194
Way cool!

714
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,833
- Honey.
- Yes?

715
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,638
Kaschi's totally psyched.

716
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,438
The kids are changing.

717
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,072
Sure, like all wearing white shirts!

718
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,951
OK, I forgot to change.

719
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,152
The faculty are talking about you.

720
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:24,233
Haven't they always?
Since when do you care?

721
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,593
I'm just saying.

722
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:25,357
- That's our sign.
- Cool.

723
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,829
We'll roll over the town
like a wave.

724
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,636
That looks rad on a wall!

725
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,108
My respect.

726
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,029
What's he doing here?

727
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,312
What's your problem, retard?
Be glad you're in.

728
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:54,874
Peace, guys.

729
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:58,078
Anyone can join The Wave
who believes in the cause.

730
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,639
Tim's right.

731
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,189
Kevin bailed.
Why the change of mind?

732
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:05,158
Chill!
Kevin had 5,000 stickers printed.

733
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,878
That shows he's worthy.

734
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,156
Sure, sponsored by daddy.

735
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,959
I think Mr Wenger
should decide if he can join or not.

736
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,669
Mr Wenger taught us about unity.
United we stand.

737
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,629
I bet your Mr Wenger wouldn't like
us tagging the whole town.

738
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,072
You're getting too uptight.
I thought we were here to have fun.

739
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,229
Well?

740
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,072
OK, grab the stuff and let's go.

741
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:42,998
Everyone got stickers?

742
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,756
What's going on?

743
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,149
Hey, guys!

744
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,953
What's wrong, retard?

745
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,193
Cover up the anarchy clowns' scribbles.

746
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,713
Righteous!
