0
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,953
Silence! What do you think
you're all playing at?

1
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,231
We are not playing, we are arguing.

2
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,833
l'm just five minutes late, and you are
all getting at each other's throats.

3
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,839
Come on, sit down.

4
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
Danielle, l'm surprised. You
and Max are going about.

5
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,309
lt's nothing, honest. l just
asked her to come for a Greek meal.

6
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,953
And l just thought we'll have
a little bit of this...

7
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,354
and a little bit of that.

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,831
lt's the little of bit of
this and that, that l don't like.

9
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,356
Jivani, what were you and
Van quarelling over?

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,558
He was making fun of Santa Maria.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,353
Santa Maria, the Virgin Mary?

12
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,840
No, Louis G Santa Maria, the
ltalian foot baller.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,309
ltalian foot ballers, are bad.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,831
You shut your mouth,
you big Spanish onion.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,956
lf you spend half as much
energy learning English...

16
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,310
as you do on arguing with
each other, you'd be perfect by now.

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,959
You have a lot to learn, and
it's just a week to your examinations.

18
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,957
And l don't think you're
quite ready at all.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,355
Excuse please, you're
committing a mistake.

20
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,269
No, l'm not.

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,834
You may have mastered a few words,
but you speak English atrociously.

22
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,316
All we need is a little electrocution.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,309
- Elocution. - Okay.

24
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,516
Part of your exam will consist
of how well you speak...

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,955
as well as notes.

26
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,958
So before we break for tea, l'm
going to go around the class...

27
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,548
and l want each of you to speak
for a minute in turn...

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,479
on whatever subject l give you.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,353
We'll start with you Danielle.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,309
Your subject is sea side.

31
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,350
The sea side?

32
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,952
l like to go to the beach...

33
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,310
take all my clothes off and lie in the sun.

34
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,316
Tell me which beach, l'll come and watch.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,317
Don't interrupt Jivani, sit
down. Go one Danielle.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,275
One weekend, l went to the isle of the Man.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,949
- The isle of man? - Yes,
but l was very disappointed.

38
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,274
There were not all men.

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,275
Thank you Danielle. That will do. Well done.

40
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,515
- Ali. - Yes please?

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,955
Television.

42
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,313
Jolly good. l'm liking very
much the English television.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,310
Every night l'm watching the Crosswords.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,309
- Crossroads. - Yes please.

45
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,318
l'm also liking all the advertisements.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,310
l'm learning lots of useful English things.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,834
Like graded grains making finer flower.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,275
And little perforation.

49
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,230
Fairly good.

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,558
- Only one thing l'm not liking.
- What's that?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,353
Paying the money for the license.

52
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,838
Not to worry. Thank you. Well done.

53
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,317
- Chuilie, your subject,
philosophy. - Very good.

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,952
ln democratic republic of China...

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,277
philosophy is for the poll where all
property invested in community...

56
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,958
each member working
according to his capacity...

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,277
receiving according to his wants, as
opposed to western countries...

58
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,834
where people are exploited by capitalism...

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,309
That is not true. Sit down.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,310
Jamila. A minute please, on art.

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,956
- Art? - Painting.

62
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,311
Okay, painting. l like very much, painting.

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,389
Last Wednesday, l did painting.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,353
You painted a picture?

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,840
No, not picture, l painted the
kitchen door.

66
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,310
l don't mean that sort of painting.
l mean, works by the great masters.

67
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,954
Leonardo Da Vinci, Turner, Matisa.

68
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,953
Oh... Now... last weekend,
l am going to Tatty gallery.

69
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,354
- Tate. - Yes Tate.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,309
And, l am not like what l see.

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,959
Painting of ladies, bare foot...

72
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,910
up to here.

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,833
And, showing their bosoms and all that.

74
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,956
Also, paintings of undressed
gentlemen, showing all their...

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,832
Thank you, that will be all.

76
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,353
Anna, can you speak for a
minute on life after death.

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,834
Yes. l do not believe in life after death.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,831
When you are dead, that is the end.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,309
Well, us Catholics go to heaven.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,310
- What about everybody else?
- Everybody else go to hell.

81
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,319
lf heaven is full of Catholics
like you, l'll prefer to go to hell.

82
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,352
l don't think we'll pursue that
subject for the moment...

83
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,316
if you don't mind. Thank you, Anna.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,231
Max, a minute please, on British birds.

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,829
l like British birds, especially blondes.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,958
Perhaps that's not very funny, Max.

87
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:41,910
Sorry.

88
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,313
Everyday, in the garden of
my lodging house, l have many birds.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,956
Blackie birds, cocky sparrows...

90
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,833
and sometimes, a blue breast.

91
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,831
Tit, a blue tit.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,310
Okay. Yesterday, l see a red robin tit.

93
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,316
lt's a robin, red breast.

94
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,840
Okay. British birds much confusing.

95
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,308
Well done. Okay Jivani, what should
we give you to speak about?

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,230
- Girls. - l don't think so, Jivani.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,351
- Have you any hobbies? - Sure.

98
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,838
My favorite is hobby is girls.

99
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,833
- Not any other hobbies? -
Sure, but not as good.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,958
l'm not stopping you, but try
and speak for one minute...

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,559
without bringing girls
into your conversation.

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
Okay. l have two other hobbies.

103
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,549
- The first is making wine. -
What's the second hobby?

104
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,830
Drinking it.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,309
After l drink it, l do my third hobby.

106
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,078
But you don't let me talk about it.

107
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,958
My friend, Finchanso,
his hobby is pinching.

108
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,957
- You mean he's a thief?
- He's not a thief.

109
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,957
You said his hobby was
pinching. What does he pinch?

110
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,354
You don't let me talk about it.

111
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,271
Thank you Jivani that was good.

112
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,233
Ranjit. What can you tell
us about evolution.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,353
Nothing at all.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,310
- Why not? - l'm not knowing
what it means.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,833
Well, it means the origin of
the species, where we all came from.

116
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,317
- Now l'm understanding. - Good.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,310
l came from Punjab, he came from ltaly.

118
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,468
- She came from France. - No,
you're taking me to literally

119
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,319
l want you to speak about how
life itself began.

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,353
A thousand apologies.

121
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,834
Life began with man and lady make love.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,309
Yes, but before that, what happened?

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,399
They put the light out.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,312
No, the story of evolution Ranjit,
was not created...

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,956
but evolved from a distinct form.

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,957
The first forms of life were in the sea.

127
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,833
Then came creatures who got out
of the sea and crawled on their legs.

128
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,510
Then came four-legged mammals.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,956
Then came creature who
could stand on two legs.

130
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,832
Then the great apes.

131
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,952
- Van. - Yes.

132
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,071
Let's see your observation on the stars.

133
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,877
What? Okay, stars.

134
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,833
- There is plenty stars. - Name some.

135
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,309
Sophia Loren, Michael Douglas.

136
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,955
- Van! - Sorry Mr. Brown, just ajoke.

137
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,958
Just? lf it isn't too much trouble...

138
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,275
can you try being more
serious for a minute?

139
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,836
Yes, for one minute, l speak serious.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,312
Stars. ln the heaven, plenty stars.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,310
Some big stars, some little stars.

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,834
Some not so big stars,
some not so little stars.

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,310
Some bright stars, some dull stars.

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,560
Some not so bright stars, some not so...

145
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,949
- Thank you, Van. - Hey,
l not speak for one minute.

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,832
Well, l think you've spoken
for long enough.

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,831
- Deryll. - Yes sir.

148
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,275
A minute please on childhood.

149
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,836
- Not want to speak about childhood.
- Why not?

150
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,959
Very bad time for me. No parents.

151
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,312
- No parents? - Santa
Maria. He's a miracle baby.

152
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,834
Mother, father killed when
l was a small boy.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,834
Childhood, very lonely.

154
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,956
Did you lose your parents when
you were a little boy?

155
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,958
l didn't exactly lose them,
l just don't know who they are.

156
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,957
You were an orphan?

157
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,310
- Yes. - That's terrible.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,956
When l was about two weeks old...

159
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,957
l was left on the steps of an orphanage...

160
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,310
in Jeremy street. And hence
my name, Jeremy.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,560
Oh deary me, l'm being
very sad for you.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,831
Not having a mummy!

163
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,558
Oh cheer up Ali, what
you never have, you never miss.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,956
Matter of fact, until was
about two, l was convinced...

165
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,832
my mummy was a big
woolly teddy bear.

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,230
Well, l must say l often
wonder sometimes...

167
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,554
whether l have any
brothers and sisters.

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,831
Hey! We be your brothers and sisters.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,309
Sure, we all become one
big happy family.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,309
And l will be your brother.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,312
And l will be your
sister. Well, not quite sister.

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,834
Well, that's very kind of you
all. l think we'll break for tea.

173
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,958
- Good evening Mr. Brown.
- Good evening Ms. Courtney.

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,833
- Headache? - Thanks,
l already got one.

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,560
- You want a couple of aspirin?
- l think l need a drink.

176
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,355
Some black coffee might help.

177
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,952
A double scotch might
help a bit more.

178
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,958
l need a break. A nice quiet
10 minutes away from my students...

179
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,354
will do me a world of good.

180
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,310
- One tomato juice please. -
l'm only wanting coca cola.

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,956
A glass of milk please.

182
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,957
Look, l only got one pair of hands.

183
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,559
They are beautiful hands.

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,831
- Thank you. - You are a beautiful girl.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,309
- Very young. - What did you want?

186
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,830
Brandy.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,310
lt's not here. l'll have to go
to the other bar. l'll be a minute.

188
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,953
Hey boys look, here is Mr. Brown.

189
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,354
What are you all doing here?

190
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,317
- We need a change.
- Canteen coffee not very good.

191
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,956
Can we buy you a drink?

192
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,275
That's very kind of you, but l've
got a bit of a headache...

193
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,356
so l'll go and sit over there.

194
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,956
- Hello Mr. Brown. - Hello Sid.

195
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,310
- Yes please? - You ever get drunk?

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,309
Every night; can't face the wife.

197
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,309
You got any family, Sid?

198
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,955
- Any family, any children?
- Oh... yes and no.

199
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,958
- What do you mean, yes and
no? - We had a little one once.

200
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,311
l was out of work, l had no
money. Got a bit desperate.

201
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,834
Wrapped the baby, took it out, &
put it on the steps of the orphanage.

202
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,350
- An orphanage?
- Yes, in Jeremy street.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,830
Jeremy street?

204
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,952
lt wasn't on Easter Monday, was it?

205
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,354
Yes, it was.

206
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,309
Sid, your father? Are you sure?

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,830
Quite so.

208
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,355
- l haven't told him yet. - But you must.

209
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,952
Some things are best left alone.

210
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,958
l mean, after all, it was a
long time ago, nearly 30 years.

211
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,959
- The truth, Mr. Brown, must be
told. - Do you think it's wise.

212
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,548
lt's a bit of shock to realise you
are related to someone...

213
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,558
so rough and vulgar.

214
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,831
Rubbish, l think Sid will
soon get used to you.

215
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,230
Thank you.

216
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,358
You know, come to think of
it, and looking at you now...

217
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,838
there's quite a resemblance.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,958
- Sid and me? - Yes, specially the profile.

219
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:24,311
- Like father like son. - Oh dear.

220
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,275
- What about your mother?
- Yes, what about her?

221
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,356
According to Sid, she sounds like a dragon.

222
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,309
Well l think, it's very romantic.

223
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,830
Enter.

224
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,831
l just came to put the stock room key back.

225
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,309
Sorry, l'm not protruding, am l?

226
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,276
No Sid, ofcourse not, quite the opposite.

227
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,834
lnfact your presence
here is most opportune.

228
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,511
Mr. Brown has something to say to
you. Haven't you, Mr. Brown?

229
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,833
- Yes. - Well, l'll leave you two alone.

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,279
- What do you want to say, son? -
Son? You just called me son.

231
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,960
lt's nothing unusual, l call everybody son.

232
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,830
They are just words.

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,831
ln any case, l'm old enough
to be your father.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,831
Come, sit down, Sid.

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,955
Cigarette Sid?

236
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,957
No, l'm sorry, l just run out of them.

237
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,832
- No, l'm offering you one.
- Oh, that very kind of you.

238
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,830
Thanks very much.

239
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,834
Listen Sid, what l wanted to ask you is...

240
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,959
- Well... how are you keeping? - l'm fine.

241
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,910
Oh good.

242
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,309
What is it you want to say to me?

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,833
Well you see it could be
a bit embarrassing.

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,956
lt's not about the cape of good hope, is it?

245
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,035
Cape of good hope?

246
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,310
The soap that we use in the wash basin.

247
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,309
- Soap? - l only did it once.

248
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:17,317
lt was easy, it was a big shop.

249
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,353
l only flicked about half a dozen.

250
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,833
- You stole six bars of soap? - Cases.

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,309
l sold them.

252
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,956
l wish you hadn't told me about that.

253
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,548
- lt wasn't about the soap?
- No, l never even heard about it.

254
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,353
Then about the crockery?

255
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,310
- Crockery in the canteen.
- You've been stealing crockery?

256
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,956
l just took about a dozen of
each. Some were old and chipped.

257
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,310
You'll tell me next
you've been nicking the chairs.

258
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,276
- Nicking the chairs.
- No, l never nicked any chairs.

259
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,356
- That's a relief. - Can't make any profit.

260
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,955
- l wonder if it's hereditary. Pardon?

261
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:01,313
No... Look Sid, tell me about
your wife. What is she like?

262
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,238
Pain in the neck.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,558
You must have been fond of her once.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,355
She's always nagging. Nag nag nag.

265
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,317
- Perhaps she feels neglected. -
She deserves to be neglected.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,956
l'd divorce her if it wasn't for one thing.

267
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,832
- What's that? - We're not married.

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,955
Not married!

269
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,958
No, we thought about it, but
never came around it.

270
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:28,311
- That's terrible!
- Well, it doesn't worry us.

271
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,957
- But that makes me... your
child... - Alright look...

272
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,559
Listen Sid, please.

273
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,958
You must get married. lf for
my... for your child's sake.

274
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,354
l mean, to give it a name.

275
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,956
lt's too late for that now, and in
any case, we can't afford it.

276
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,310
l mean, she wants a new outfit,
a proper do.

277
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,558
lt's not wise to waste all that money.

278
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,956
- Look Sid l'll pay. - You'll what?

279
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,958
- l'll pay for the wedding.
- Why, what for?

280
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,311
- l want to. - Can l have a new suit?

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,956
- Yeah. - And a car with flowers?

282
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,275
- Yes. - And booze afterwards?

283
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,277
- Naturally.

284
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,516
l know it sounds strange, but
l have got my reasons.

285
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,958
Can you and your wife meet me in Red
line pub after school tonight?

286
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,310
- That will be alright.
- See you there then.

287
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,315
See you at night, son.

288
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,560
My own father a thief!

289
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,316
Yet l suppose l should
be grateful in a way.

290
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,309
lf he hadn't left me at the
orphanage steps...

291
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,834
but brought me up himself, what
would l be like today?

292
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,510
- Dad... - What?

293
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,956
- Your drink. - Oh, drink, son.

294
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,278
- l brought this as well.
- What's this? lt must be 50 quid.

295
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,836
- 53. - Where did you get it from?

296
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,317
l flicked it from someone's pocket.

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,353
Chip off the old block, eh?

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,956
He didn't realise?

299
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,833
No l suppose, he didn't bash me up.

300
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,833
l could pick one too.

301
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,834
Quite enjoying yourself?
Very good, son.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,232
- Mr. Brown... Mr. Brown!
- Yeah darling, what...

303
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,956
Sorry Ms. Courtney, l was miles away.

304
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,957
Well, did you tell him?

305
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,832
No, l don't really think l ought to.

306
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,838
But ofcourse you must tell him,
Mr. Brown.

307
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:40,271
- There's no other alternative.
- Oh, there is.

308
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,358
- What's that? - l could cheat myself.

309
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,833
Danielle, what are you doing tonight?

310
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,355
Why you ask?

311
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,952
There's a dance at the students club.

312
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,354
You want to come?

313
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,558
Hey l was going to ask Danielle
to come with me.

314
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,070
Too bad. l ask her first.

315
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,317
- What you say? - Well,

316
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,831
Good. l'll show you how
to do the ltalian shuffle.

317
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,239
You stand like this, then
you put your arms around my neck.

318
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,835
l put my arms around your waist.
Then we put our cheeks together.

319
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,833
- What do we do next? - Who cares?

320
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,479
l hope l'm not interrupting anything.

321
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,512
l as just showing Danielle how
to dance the ltalian shuffle.

322
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,353
What kind of shuffle, l'd like to see.

323
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,949
Part of your examination next
week will consist of reading aloud.

324
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,835
So l hope tonight, we have a
practice of reading out a poem.

325
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,310
Jolly good. l'm hearing
ajolly good poem last night.

326
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,309
There was a young lady called Nelly.

327
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,831
Who was tattooed all over in Delhi.

328
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,955
Right down her back, the Union Jack.

329
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,833
And God save the Queen on her belly.

330
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,956
Thank you Ali, sit down.

331
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,356
The poem l'm going to
read is called Daffodils...

332
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,315
by William Wordsworth.

333
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,958
l'll ask each of you to
read out a line in turn.

334
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,832
We'll start again with you, Danielle.

335
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,829
- l wandered lonely... as a cloth? - Cloud.

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:15,830
Sorry.

337
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,312
That floats high on air,
valleys and hillies.

338
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,318
- Valleys and hills. - Jolly good.

339
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,312
- When all at once l saw a clout. - Cloud.

340
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:42,310
- A host of golden daffodilies.
- Daffodils.

341
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,353
Besides zhe lakes, beneath zhe trees.

342
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,840
- THE... THE... THE. - Zhe... zhe... zhe.

343
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,275
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

344
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,310
Well done.

345
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,958
Continuous as stars shine.

346
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,958
Continuous as the stars that shine.

347
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,833
Continuous as the stars that shine.

348
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,315
Better.

349
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,958
And tinkle on the milky way.

350
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,311
- Twinkle! - Thousand apologies.

351
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,317
Anybody know what the milky way is?

352
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,831
Yes senor. Chocolate.

353
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,319
The milky way is a luminous
collection of stars.

354
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,959
l see. Sophia Loren, Michael Douglas...

355
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,278
No Van. Go on, it's your turn.

356
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,394
Okay. They stretch
in never ending light.

357
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,312
Around the marching of the bale.

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,355
l'm sure Mr. Wordsworth
would have found that...

359
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,838
quite an uplifting experience.

360
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:05,836
Mr. Brown, l just got a call
from your... from Sidney.

361
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,274
He asked me to tell you that
when you're finished...

362
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,356
he'll be waiting for you at
the bar of the Red Line pub...

363
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:13,317
with your... with his wife.

364
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,479
- Hello Sid. - Hello Mr. Brown.

365
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,558
- Where is your wife?
- She's gone to the wash room.

366
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,275
- He won't be a minute.
- She ordered the drinks?

367
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,356
Yeah, l told her you'll
pay for them when you came in.

368
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:36,354
Hey Sid, where's that teacher?

369
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,831
Meet my wife. Don't laugh.

370
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:43,272
- Hello - Pleased to meet you, Mrs...

371
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,358
- You might call me Ma. - Ma.

372
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,358
ls it true what Sid says that
you are going to pay for our wedding?

373
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,315
Yes, Ma.

374
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,356
- That' a great relief, Sid. - Yes.

375
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,309
- But what l don't understand... -
l'll try and explain.

376
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,953
Remember you told me
about leaving a baby...

377
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,832
- at an orphanage in
Jeremy street? - Yeah.

378
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,549
One of the reasons why l
want you two to get married is...

379
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,558
is that your child will be illegitimate.

380
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,836
What a lovely thought!
l must give you a kiss.

381
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,510
l'll tell you something now.
30 years ago...

382
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,956
you left that baby in
the orphanage at Jeremy street.

383
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,310
- Yes, it was about that
time. - On an Easter Monday?

384
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,275
Well, even l was left at
an orphanage 30 years ago...

385
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,310
in Jeremy street on an Easter Monday.

386
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,312
Sid, what a coincidence!

387
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,350
lf l tell you l was that baby...

388
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,269
would you say that was a coincidence?

389
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,958
- No, a blooming miracle. - Why?

390
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,354
Because that baby as a girl.

391
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,196
Oh dearie me! l am losing again

392
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,231

395
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,154
l said ''how you doing'' not
''what you having?''

396
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,669
- What? - Never mind! Come on

397
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,117

402
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,713
Thelma Ritter, eh? l'm Giovanni Cupello

403
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,392
That is not her name! Thelma

404
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:14,995

- Cheers - Thanks a lot

408
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,953
- How is the Las Vegas kid doing, eh?
- Terrible

409
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,188
- You never win nothing on this
machine - l tell you! lt's fixed

410
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,231
Oh no, lady behind bar is telling me

- Good evening - Good evening

426
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:25,349
- You want a Thelma Ritter? - Pardon?

427
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:29,193
- Thelma Ritter, bitter - You've
been talking to Sid the caretaker

428
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,317
Sure, he's teaching me more of
his cockeyned slanging rhyme

429
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,874
- Cockney - Excuse me

430
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,115
- Max! - Yes Mr. Brown

431
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,276
lt's your point of interest! You
have to remember what a cockney is

432
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:44,234
Sure, lt's someone who was
born near the sound of Bows Balls

433
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,993
- Bells - Hockay

447
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,035
Quiet the pair of you! Why
don't you share the money?

448
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,590
lt's a good idea! There's five of us

449
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,197
That's one pound each

450

452
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,912
Actually, it's time you all

00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,713
lt's your exams tomorrow! You should
be taking every opportunity to study

454
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,911

455
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,632

Come on Ali! You too

457
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,799
- Waiter? - Pardon?

458
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,956
A gin and tonic and a lager please

459
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,195
l'm afraid you're making a mistake

460
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,911
Don't be ridiculous! l know what l want

461

A gin and tonic for me and a lager for
my husband! He's just parking the car

00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,995
No, you don't understand!
l'm a school teacher

463
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,871
That's nothing to be ashamed of

464
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,592
l think it's quite commendable

465
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,269
That you should supplement your
income by working in a public house

466
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,038
Look Madam, l am not
what you think l am

467
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,230
And l am not interested in
your personal problems!

468
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,275
l just want a gin and tonic and a lager

469
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,628
- Yes... - Now

470
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,239
A gin and tonic and a lager

471
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,314
- Good evening Mr. Brown
- Hello Sid, how are you?

472
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,634
l'll have a gold watch

473
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,149
- Pardon? - A scotch

474
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,633
l wasn't offering you a drink

475
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,159
- You are? - Nevermind

476
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:54,840
A scotch for Sid! 20 cigarettes for me

477
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,315
And a gin and tonic and a
lager for that lady over there

478
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,350
She thinks l am a waiter

479
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,989
- What? - She thinks l'm a waiter

480
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,194
- How long have we been doing it?
- What?

481
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,790
- This waiting - l'm not! l'm not a waiter

482
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,194
- You are? - Never mind

483
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,637
One pound 60 please

484
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,228
Well actually these drinks are for
that lady and gentleman over there

485
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,032
- They've still got to be paid for
- Yes but...

486
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,232
Never mind l'll pay for
them and they can pay me later

487
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,996
How much is it for the
gin and tonic and the lager?

488
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,111
- 72 - 72

489
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,071
- Good health - Good health

490
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,830
There you are! 72 p. Please

491
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,270
- Didn't l see you take a drink of
my lager? - Yes, it was only a sip

492
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,188
Oh yes l suppose you were tasting
it to make sure it was fit to drink

493
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,878
lt was purely accidental

494
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,150
l've a good mind to report
you to the brewery

495
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,276
Frankly, l couldn't care
less what you do

496
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,314
Your attitude is typical of
the working class mentality

497
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,955
lt's people like you that are ruining the
country! You're nothing but a peasant

498
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,231
And you sir are a bourgeois
snob! 72 p. Please

499
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,239
l refuse to pay for a drink that
has been contaminated by your lips

500
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,270
l see

501
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,676
All right don't pay for it!
Have it on me!

502
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,196
Here you go!

503
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,075
Silence

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,152
This is disgraceful! Ten minutes past
seven and Mr. Brown has not arrived

505
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,191
But you are mistaken!

506
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,278
- He is here, isn't he Anna? - Ja

507
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,960
- That's right! He's always early
- Yes please

508
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,232
Tonight, he was being so early that he
was here ten minutes before he arrived

509
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,357
- He's just gone out
- Where has he gone out to?

510
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,596
- Tea room - Toilet

511
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,713
l beg your pardon!

512
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,239
- Toilet - Tea room

513
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,952
Would you like to try again?

514
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:50,914
Vot they mean is, first he goest to
tea room, then he goes to toilet

515
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,598
Yeah

516
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,712
Hello Miss Courtney, sorry l'm late

517
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,637
- But you're not - Really?

518
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,955
According to your students, you
were here all the time

519
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:02,356
- Oh yes well
- And where exactly were you?

520
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,069
- We told you, he... - l'm asking Mr. Brown

521
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,870
- Well? - Ah yes...

522
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,191
What is going on?

523
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,799
l don't know, but from
their sign language

524
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,514
l think they're trying to say
l was having a cup of tea in the toilet

525
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,996
Actually Miss Courtney, l'll tell you the
truth! l am late, and the reason is this!

526
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,951
l'd just called to the pub
opposite for some cigarettes

527
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,311
l was mistaken for a waiter, bought two
drinks for two people l'd never met before

528
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,115
Was called a peasant and finished up by
pouring a glass of lager over a man's head

529
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,151
You're an even bigger liar
than your students!

530
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,390
l would have thought you'd have
made an effort to be early this evening

531
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,788
After all, it's your last
chance to teach them something

532
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,797
Before they take their exams tomorrow

533
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,911
Yes, miss Courtney you're
quite right as usual

534
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,397
Not that l think any of them have
the remotest chance of passing

535
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,990
ln your places please

536
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,112
- She thinks ve are stupid
- l think she may have a point

537
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,832
- Por favore - Yes Juan

538
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,638
What you think about this
exam? You think we pass?

539
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,955
Do l think you'll pass? Juan,
for the past 13 weeks,

540
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,957
you've all been coming here to study

541
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,275
13 weeks of hard work,
diligence and application

542
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,231
13 weeks of blood toil and sweat

543
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,237
Slowly, little by little, you have improved

544
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,316
When you sit down to take
your examination tomorrow

545
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,149
l will have no doubts whether you'll pass
or not! You haven't a cat in hells chance!

546
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,715
Quiet!

547
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,594
Oh blimey, you are not
giving us any confidence

548
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,233
Maybe some of you may
manage to scrape through

549
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,237
But l shall be most
surprised if you all pass

550
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,240
l shall pass to plove supeliolity
of lepubric of China

551
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,631
Yes we'll see about that!

552
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,672
ln the meantime, l want tonight to
talk about the exam and afterwards

553
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,189
lf any of you have any questions about
any points you're not sure of

554
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,276
They'll just ask and l'll
do my best to answer them

555
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,030
- Excuse me please - Not yet Taro

556
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,229
l want to talk about the exam first

557
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,510
- Then you can ask a question - Ah so

558
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:58,756
Now the first thing is
l shall not be taking you

559
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,915
Excuse please Mr. Brown, where
will you not be taking us to?

560
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,312
l mean l shan't be here
tomorrow when you take your exam

561
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,519
Jelly good! We can be reading all
the answers from our books

562
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,710
- There will be somebody here
- Oh dear

563
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,513
l am thinking l am going
to be up a gummy tree

564
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,677
ln any case, you're
not supposed to cheat

565
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,189
lt's customary for another
teacher from another school

566
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,912
To take an examination of this kind

567
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,273
Excuse me please

568
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,073
- Later Taro please - Ok

569
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:35,276
When you take your examination, the lower
Cambridge certificate is not too difficult

570
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,910
The exam is divided into 3 parts

571
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,075
There will be an oral exam and a
written one! Then comes dictation

572
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,315
ls that his name?

573
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,752
ls that who's name?

574
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,632
The man who is going to be taking us to
be doing the examination! Dick Tation

575
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:58,238
Dictation is when a person reads something
out aloud and another person copy it down

576
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,069
Like a short fingered typist

577
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,756
- Short hand typist - Yes please

578
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,713
Excuse me please

579
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,149
You can ask your question in a moment Taro

580
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,396
When you've completed your examination,
the papers are taken away to be marked

581
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,231
And you will be notified
of the results by post

582
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,830
So please make sure you write your
names clearly on your papers

583
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,393
Christian name and surname

584
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:23,671
- l cannot do that - Why not?

585
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,915
l am not a Christian

586
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,390
lf you want to be pedantic about it
Ranjeet, write your surname and forename

587
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,629
l am not having four names also

588
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:41,076
The prefix fore in this case is spelt FORE
and means first for example ''forefinger''

589
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,514
Uno momente! Four finger - one thumb

590
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,756
- No not four fingers - Si, si

591
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:55,316
One, two, three, four

592
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:00,714
- This is my forefinger - No, it's only one

593
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,757
l wonder if l should cancel tomorrow

594
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,233
- Por favore? - Never mind

595
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:09,399
Excuse please

596
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:14,917
- Yes you can ask your question now Taro
- Requesto permission to visit toilet

597
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,597
- Yes of course, sorry - Thank you

598
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,836
Has anybody else got a question?

599
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,077
Yes, after tomollow, will we see you again?

600
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,953
That depends on so many things,
whether l'm engaged for another term

601
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,229
Or whether any of you decide

602
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,238
Whatever the results of your exam to
come back for a further course

603
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:40,912
l will give you my address!
You can come and see me any time

604
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,557
Quiet, quiet!

605
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,070
Mr. Brown, can you spare
a moment please?

606
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,397
Certainly, l suggest you all
study your verbs until l return

607
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,955
As you know, another teacher will
be taking the exam tomorrow

608
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,115
Yes

609
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,949
The gentleman who used to be the principal
of this college will be supervising your class

610
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,833
He's in my office now! l thought it
might be a good idea if you met him

611
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,952
- l'd like to - Do try to make
a good impression

612
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,516
lt does no harm if he's
favourably disposed towards you

613
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,550
This is our English teacher Mr. Brown

614
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:18,115
- lt's you - lt's a small world, isn't it?

615
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,639
Silence please!

616
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,239
Exam in progress

617
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,030
Good evening Mr. Cupello! All
ready for your examination?

618
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,357
Sure, everything's gonna be ''Oki talki''

619
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,673
Bueno Serra everybody

620
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,075
- Has anybody got a pen? - Yes

621
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,078
- But prease lemember who it
berongs to - Sure l will

622
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,554
What are you doing?

623
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,115
l tell you! l just been studying my verbs!

624
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,073
So l'm gonna write them down on
my hand so l don't forget

625
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,715
- Typical of western dishonesty
- l think it's a good idea

626
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,714
You want to write verb
tenses on your hand too?

627
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,229
No, l'm ok on verbs but
not good on pronouns

628
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,074
- So write pronouns - No need

629
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:25,395
l already write them on handkerchief

630
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,595
Smart!

631
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,957
lt is wrong to cheat

632
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,231
- Don't you agree Ali? -
Not at all, l am also cheating

633
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,912
You have got something
written on your handkerchief?

634
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,678
No, it is in my hat

635
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,270
This is terrible! lf you are found
out, you will be disqualified

636
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,709
Old japanese philosopher he say

637
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,198
''Man who deals flom
bottomo, usually end up on top''

638
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,275
- You as well?
- Taro not good on adverbs

639
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:04,196
So have some written on chair seat

640
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,832
Good evening everyone

641
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,076
Nice to see you all are bright and early

642
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,519
l expect you're feeling a bit nervous

643
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,598
- l am not nervous - Good

644
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,195
- l am putrified - Petrified

645
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,188
Well do your best!

646
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,993
l'm not supposed to be
here so l shall be in the pub

647
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,917
- All right? - All right

648
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,749
But if you all call in when you finish your
exam, l'll buy you all an end of term drink

649
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,272
- Good luck Taro - Thank you

650
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,229
You must be nervous! That's the first
time you haven't stood up and bowed

651
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,795
- Good luck Juan - Muchas gracias

652
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,837
- Good luck Giovanni - Thanks professori

653
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,118
You're not too nervous to
shake hands, are you?

654
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,550
- Si l am very nervous
- Nonsense, come on

655
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,717
- That didn't hurt, did it? - Not a lot

656
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:56,989
Ranjeet

657
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:01,672
- That's funny, where did that ink come
from? - Maybe your pen has got a leak

658
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,193
- Let me see your hand Giovanni
- There's nothing there professori

659
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,232
- The other one
- There's nothing there either

660
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,876
There's something there now, isn't it?

661
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,959
Oh no, my pen is got a leak as well

662
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,069
And l suppose while it was leaking, it
just happened to write a few verbs down

663
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,238
Sorry professori, my
verbs are a bit bad

664
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,952
l suggest you clean all that off

665
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,516
- l don't seem to have a handkerchief
myself - Max has got a hankerchief!

666
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,874
- l got no handkerchief - What's
that sticking out of your top pocket?

667
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,632
Oh that, lt's not a proper handkerchief

668
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,718
Maybe Ali's got a proper handkerchief

669
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,117
Let me see that handkerchief Max

670
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:52,117
- l see, pronouns are your
weak point - lt's right

671
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,508
l'll keep this

672
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,675
How many other little
tricks have you been up to Ali?

673
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,394
You're very quiet, are you
keeping something under your hat?

674
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,917
Blimey, how are you guessing that?

675
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,116
l didn't!

676
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,355
While l'm thinking of it, Taro would
you like to stand up please?

677
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,554
Very ingenious!

678
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:26,151
- Now Juan, where's your little
crib hidden? - Por favore?

679
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,750
Never mind por favore! l know it's
somewhere, it's written all over your face

680
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,997
No, no write on my face

681
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,918
This is no laughing matter

682
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:40,589
- Come on Juan, where is it? - Under table

683
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,349
- Ranjeet - A thousand apologies

684
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:59,790
Danielle, Anna, Jamila, Su Lee?

685
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,912
We no cheat! Plefer to pass
exam on own melits

686
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,315
l'm grad... glad to hear it

687
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,349
Some last minute coaching Brown?

688
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,716
- No, no l just came in to wish them luck
- They're going to need more than luck

689
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:14,829
Goodbye Mr. Brown

690
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,191
- Listen, l'm sorry about
yesterday - Goodbye Mr. Brown

691
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,515
Goodbye! Good luck

692
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:27,151
Now l want absolute silence during
this examination, understand?

693
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,635
- Same again! - Don't you
think you've had enough?

694
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,194
How can l have had enough?
l'm still standing

695
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,710
- You've been to the loo once
- That doen't mean anything

696
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,191
You're making it up

697
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,796
- Hello Sid - Same again, thank you

698
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,310
Half a bitter please Mavis and
whatever Sid's drinking

699
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,149
- Sid tells me you're not
married - That's right l'm not

700
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,272
- l'm not married as well
- Congratulations

701
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,594
- l haven't even got a boyfriend - Really?

702
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,511
- How about you?
- l haven't got a boyfriend either

703
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,839
Not a regular one anyway!

704
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,793
Look, have a drink on me
alright? These are for you

705
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,791
- There you go Sid! There's your pre-exam
- Pre cheer! You learned it, aint you?

706
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,148
- Yeah - Good old chap

707
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,555
- How's your Lil? - She's still living

708
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,392
- You don't mean that - Yeah

709
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:25,393
You know when l was courting her, l used
to worship the ground she walked on

710
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,400
Now l worship the ground
that is coming to her

711
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,276
- That's not a very nice thing to
say - No, but it's more sincere

712
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:37,275
- You take my tip son, stay single
- l haven't much choice at the moment

713
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,753
l can't afford to get married!

714
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,269
- Still l've got Josephine
- Who's Josephine?

715
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,790
- ls that your bit of
crumpets? - No my siamese cat

716
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,872
- My students will be all hard at it
now - Yeah, there's a lot of it about

717
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,796
l was talking about their exam

718
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,789
- l shall miss them next term
- Cheer up son

719
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,229
- What you want is another
drink - Yeah, good idea!

720
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,316
Yeah, this time l'll have a pint

721
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,318
A penny for them!

722
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,228
l was just wondering how my students
were getting on with their exams

723
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,631
- l expect they'll be all right - l hope so

724
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,389
l won't know what to do with myself now
that the term's over in the evenings

725
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,153
lt must get a bit lonely
for you living on your own

726
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:35,998
l don't live on my own
exactly! l've got Josephine

727
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,994
Yeah she's marvellous! l don't
know what to do without her

728
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:44,396
She's very affectionate! Every morning she
wakes me up by nibbling in my ear

729
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,039
That must be nice for you

730
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,913
- l didn't allow her in the
bedroom at first - No?

731
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,510
lt wasn't as clean as she might be

732
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,239
She used to sleep in the bathroom

733
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,278
- That sounds a bit uncomfortable
- No, she was quite happy on the floor

734
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,996
She must think a lot of
you to put up with that

735
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,714
She does! Every evening when i
come back home, she runs up to me

736
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,149
And rubs up all against my leg

737
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,079
How erotic!

738
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,876
- She's Siamese
- Oh well that explains it

739
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:22,154
The trouble is like most Siamese she's
inclined to be a bit oversexed

740
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,556
- She sounds it - l'm
thinking of having her doctored

741
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,395
And l thought you were
such a nice fellow

742
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:30,833
- Pardon? - Nevermind

743
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,837
- Where is Sid? - He's gone
back to the school

744
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,757
That is if he can find his way back

745
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:40,995
- Sid - Yes Miss Courtney

746
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,234
- You reek of drink
- l beg your pardon?

747
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,915
- Drink - lf you insist

748
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:52,197
- l'll have a drop of your sherry
- You had more than enough already

749
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,915
- Have you finished? - Yes please

750
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,873
- How'd you do?
- l'm very well! How do you do?

751
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,877
l mean how did you get on
with your exams?

752
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,753
We hope we have not let
Mr. Brown down

753
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,349
Miss Courtney!

754
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,717
- Would you care for a sherry
before you go? - l'd be delighted

755
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,549
Do sit down!

756
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:23,356
lt takes me back... Here in the old office

757
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,395
l expect you miss the hurly
burly of the school life

758
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:29,200
Yes l sleep nights now

759
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,275
- There we are - Thank you

760
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,269
You know Miss Courtney,
l didn't know you indulged

761
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,630
l don't really, just an occasional sherry

762
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,273
Ready for another?

763
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:48,193
- Everyone got a drink? - Yeah

764
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:51,238
l just would like to say
l wish you all every success

765
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,113
lt's been great teaching
you and l shall miss you

766
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,794
You have been giving
us much wisdom

777
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,238
How do you think the foreign
students got on with their exams?

778
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,349
Terrible!

779
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,198
How do you think you got
on with your exams?

780
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,639
Fantastic!

781
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,231
The answer to the
question: ''What is a sentence?''

782
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,669
The chappie in the turban answered

783
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,678
''A sentence is what you
get when you are sent to prison''

784
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,671
The questions were being
very easy to answer

785
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,351
To the question: ''What is the
past participle of l write?''

786
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:06,353
The Spanish fellow answered,
''l have wrotten''

787

l answer everyting OK

788
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:14,710
The chinese lady was
writing backwards

789
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:19,075
Of course, l don't know how
they answered the other questions

790
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,274
But if what l saw is anything to go by, then l
shall be very surprised if any of them pass

791
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,675
Goodbye Miss Courtney

792
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,917

- What are you doing with my
wife? - Nothing, l just...

797
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,636

Principal's office

00:50:55,960 --> 00:50:56,915
Good evening Sidney

802
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:00,153
Good evening Miss Courtney, just
giving your door a bit of a touch up

803
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,989
Had a nice holiday?

804
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,236

805
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,635
- Pardon? - Sunny Spain

806
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,352

807
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:12,719
Oh, l am sorry! Still l expect you enjoyed
all those exotic Spanish dishes

808
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,195
- l got food poisoning - Oh sorry

809
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:16,475
Did it rain every day?

810
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,909
Oh no! When l got
food poisoning the sun came out

811
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:22,831
When l got better, it went back in

812
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:27,270
Apart from the day before we
left. That was absolutely glorious

813
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:30,073
- Well at least you had one
good day - l got sunburnt

814
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:31,955
What a pity!

815
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,151
- Hello Sid - Mr. Brown, welcome back

816
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:45,273

817
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:51,994
- No, is she in? - Yeah,
but she's in a shocking temper

818
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,236
- l'll see her later then
- Glad to be back?

819
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,679
Yeah, l shall miss my old class

820
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,837
But l shall enjoy the challenge of
starting again with fresh minds

821
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,914
l wonder how many different nationalities
l'll have to deal with this term?

822
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,916
Good evening

Good evening Mr. Brown

l am most happy to
be seeing you again

849
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:17,436
Anna, Ranjeet! What
are you doing here?

850
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:20,472
We failed our exam but we are
coming back for more lessons

851
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:23,912
That is correct! Like Roberty Bruce say

852
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:28,193
lf at first you are not succeeding, try, try

lf at first you are not succeeding...

855
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:34,876
Never mind

856
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,554
Were you not expecting us?

857
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,911
No the authorities don't notify the
individual teachers of the results

858
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,474
And as usual Miss Courtney has
kept me in the dark

859
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:43,999
She took the lights out?

860
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,916
No, she never told me!
This is Zoltan, Ranjeet

861
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:52,510
Delighted to be making
your acquaintance

862
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,433
What a nice man! He
is giving me a present

863
00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,269
He wants you to read out
something from his phrase book

864
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,795
A thousand apologies

865
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,878
Waiter my soup is cold

866
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,555
Pleased to meet you

Thank you

868
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,433
Good and this is Anna

869
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:17,595
How do you do?

870
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,188
Yes, Thank you

871
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,434
Would you both like to sit down

872
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,075
This time l sit at front, then
l can be learning quicker

873
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,078
l will be sitting in my
accustomed place

874
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,592
Well, l was hoping that l had
a hundred percent pass record

875
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,836
But still, two failures
out of ten isn't bad

876
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,239
Good evening master

877
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,633
Four failures out of ten

878
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:45,988
Jamila you failed

879
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:47,668
Sorry Master

880
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:50,873
But maybe next time
l shall be winning

881
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:52,548
l'm sure you mean winning

882
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,433
- And you, Taro - Ah so

883
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:57,189
Loss of face

884
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,758
Not goodo for Japanese

885
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,589
First, considered Hara-kiri

886
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:06,553
Then decide to como
backo for more lessons

887
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,672
But if no pass next time

888
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,029
Just make sure you don't do
it on the classroom floor

889
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,478
Well, as you can see you re not alone

890
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:17,510
This is Zoltan

891
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:19,713
Jamila, and Taro

892
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:23,351
- Pleased to meet you
- Good evening

893
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,595
Jamila, you want your place back?

894
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,836
No, l sit at backside with Taro

895
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,996
No Jamila! You will sit at the back

896
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,634
Backside is what you sit on

897
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:41,951
No master, what l sit on is chair

898
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,678
Yes, l can see why you failed

- You don't need to tell me!

903
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:03,119
That's more than l can say for you

00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,798
- Por favore? - Never mind

905

00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,630
He doesn't speak English

910
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:16,957
lt's all right! l teach him

911
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,637
That would be like the
blind leading the blind

912
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,116
Blind

913
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,510
He not see!

914
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:30,950

00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,148
- l take it you are Svedish...
Swedish? - Ja

929
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,236

930
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,670
- Stockholm! And what is yourjob?
- Au pair

931
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:21,839
Very nice

932
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:22,949
Where shall we sit you?

933
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,116
There's a place here with me

934
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,276
There is also a place here beside me

935
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,913
Here please

936
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:32,109
l think we'll sit you at
the front for the time being

937
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:42,070
You're sitting next to
Juan, behind you is Ranjeet

938
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,398
At the back are Taro and Jamila

939
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:46,956
She is Anna and he is Zoltan

940
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:48,309
And l am Ali

941
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:53,192
- Ali, not you as well
- As well as what please?

942
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:54,912
- You failed? - Yes

943
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,679
l am getting twenty out of one hundred

944
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,028
That's nothing to be proud about

945
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,435
You're supposed to get at least fifty
to pass! Twenty is disgraceful

946
00:59:01,560 --> 00:59:05,189
Last year l am getting nothing at all

947
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,155
So l am doing better! l sit

948
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,232
- Scuse please! Get up - What for?

949
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:19,350
- That is my seat
- l not see your name on seat

950
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:22,599
Get your big Spanish
bottom out of my chair

951
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:26,191
You no talk me like that! l punch you

952
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,231
That's enough! Seats
are not reservable

953
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,555
Sit somewhere else, Ali

954
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,918
Ok, l sit at the back

955
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:33,919
You big spanish bottom

956
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:39,516
We'll wait a few more moments in
case there are any more new students

957
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:41,755
Buena Serra

958
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,554
lt's just like old times

959
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,751
lt's a big surprise, eh professori?

960
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,797
l am not disappointed to be back

961
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:57,078
- Who is that?
- This is lngrid! She is Swedish

962
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,836
She is also sitting in my seat

963
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,269
- You will move yes? - l will move no

964
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,196
- You can sit next to me
- No, you sit next to me

965
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,638
That's right! You sit beside Max and
Giovanni because l want to sit here

966
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,878
l'm sorry Danielle! But l think it's
important the new students sit at the front

967
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,153
- l don't like you - l'm so worried

968
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:20,519
You can come and sit next to me

969
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,592
- Sit between us - Ok

970
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:31,356
Well l must say that l'm
extremely disappointed in you all

971
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,874
lt's not your fault professori!
We not pass because we're stupid

972
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,478
- And what does that make me?
- More stupid

973
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,589
Exactly! Out of ten students
l've nine failures

974
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,155
Vely solly l'm rate

975
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,108
Congratulations! You are
getting ten out of ten

976
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:16,671
Well l really don't know what to say

977
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:22,513
Oh blimey, if you are
not knowing what to say

978
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,153
How are you going to be teaching us?

979
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,192
- l'll ignore that stupid remark
- Jolly good

980
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,908
Because you have all failed, l have failed

981
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:37,233
lt's perfectly true

982
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:39,510
This term, l want much
more effort from all of you

983
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:41,232
You must all pull your socks up

984
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,270
lt's all right

985
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,548
No Juan, l was speaking figuratively

986
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,999
- Por favore - Never mind

987
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,475
You must all concentrate
much harder this term

988
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:55,235
We shall start at the beginning again

989
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:58,552
And this time l shall be giving
twice as much homework as last time

990
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,513
l want a hundred per cent
effort from all of you

991
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:09,275
Now tonight l want you each to tell
me what you did during the holidays

992
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:10,629
- Please? - Yes Zoltan

993
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,117
l do not understand what you are saying

994
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,834
Never mind! Just keep quiet and listen

995
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:20,910
Never mind

996
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,599
l speak

997
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,480
No speak

998
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,951
- Thank you Juan - lt's all right

999
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,910
Now, what have you been
doing with yourself, Jamila?

1000
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:54,875
l went on holidays to visit all my family

1001
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,673
- You went to Bombay? - No Birmingham

1002
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,396
Birmingham, the Mecca of the Midlands

1003
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,555
- And you Taro? - Ah so

1004
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,549
What did you get up to?

1005
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:16,838
Went on fishing holiday

1006
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:20,589
- Good, did you catch
anything? - Catcho heavy coldo

1007
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:25,037
Did you enjoy your break Ali?

1008
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,238
l am not breaking anything

1009
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:32,154
- The holiday - Jolly good

1010
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,199
l am learning how to be
driving a motor car

1011
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,390
Good, that's very useful! When
do you take your test?

1012
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,670
Oh blimey

1013
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:40,150
l'm already failing my test

1014
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,230
The examiner man was
jumping out of the car

1015
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,918
When l was going down a hill

1016
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:51,398
- l expect you were going too
fast - No, l was going backwards

1017
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:58,876
- What did you do Su Lee?
- Spent time lighting

1018
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,797
- Lighting what? - Lighting book

1019
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:02,715
Ah book

1020
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:05,630
What sort of book are you lighting, writing?

1021
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,270
ls called The Democratic way of Life

1022
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,868
All about glorious freedom-loving Chinese

1023
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,438
l see, a work of fiction

1024
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:17,756
Tell us what you did with yourself Ranjeet

1025
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,268
l have been looking after my cousin
while her husband has been away

1026
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:23,550
Very commendable

1027
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,996
He is being discharged this week

1028
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:27,872
Discharged? He's been in hospital?

1029
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,319
No prison

1030
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:34,992
And he is being sent to
prison for something he didn't do

1031
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,750
- What really didn't he do?
- He didn't run fast enough

1032
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:42,670
Quiet! Tell us what you did Giovanni

1033
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:45,953
l went to Marsgate

1034
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:49,918
- Margate - Scusi

1035
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,516
l met this fantastic girl

1036
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:54,953
She had the biggest...

1037
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,312
l'm sure we all get your meaning

1038
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:02,520
Every day we used to go on the sand for a bit

1039
01:05:05,560 --> 01:05:08,074
- For a while - Scusi?

1040
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:10,038
To go on the sands for a while

1041
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:14,551
To go on the sands for a bit can imply you
were, well doing something naughty

1042
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,309
That's right, we were very
naughty on the sand

1043
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,435
Silence!

1044
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:23,435
Mr. Brown, miss Courtney
wants you right away

1045
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:24,829
Thank you Sid

1046
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,713
You can have an early tea break and
we'll continue with this later

1047
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,719
- Please - Yes Zoltan

1048
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:44,229
No, you must try to speak! Speak

1049
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:46,710
You

1050
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,594
- Girl - Yes please

1051
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:58,598
- No you re not a girl - You

1052
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,471
Ah, you have a girl friend

1053
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:09,512
- l understand, go on - Girl English

1054
01:06:09,640 --> 01:06:10,629
An English girl

1055
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,637
- You - Me

1056
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:16,275
You want me to write a letter to your girl?

1057
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,390
Please

1058
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,438
What do you want me to write?

1059
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:26,710
What l write?

1060
01:06:44,640 --> 01:06:46,995
l think l get the general idea

1061
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,670
Sidney!

1062
01:06:58,520 --> 01:06:59,839
Yes Miss Courtney

1063
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:02,155
Did you tell Mr. Brown
l wanted to see him?

1064
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:03,633
Yeah definitely

1065
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,710
l think this should be all right

1066
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:12,232
Dear Miss, l'm writing to tell
you of my feelings for you

1067
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,032
l think you are beautiful

1068
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:18,111
l want to hold you in my arms and kiss you

1069
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,273
Please say you feel the same about me

1070
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,155
All my love

1071
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:24,709
Yes!

1072
01:07:24,840 --> 01:07:25,750
Thank you

1073
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,878
- What is going on here? - Nothing

1074
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,070
lt certainly didn't sound like nothing

1075
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:38,237
l was writing a letter for
Zoltan to his girl friend

1076
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,635
He was showing me his
appreciation in Hungarian

1077
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:42,749
Kindly leave us

1078
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:49,955
Go, l said go! Go

1079
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:53,349
Now Mr. Brown

1080
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:56,155
l understand none of your
previous students

1081
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,872
Passed their lower
Cambridge Certificate

1082
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,558
l think there were a few near misses

1083
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:00,874
That's not good enough

1084
01:08:01,360 --> 01:08:03,476
Obviously Mr. Brown,
you are sadly lacking

1085
01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:05,636
ln the necessary
qualities required to teach English

1086
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,273
- Just a moment - Don't interrupt

1087
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,479
l shall be keeping a very close
eye on you this term, Mr. Brown

1088
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:13,114
Unless l see a marked improvement,
out you go

1089
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,038
- lt's not... - l have no
wish to listen to feeble excuses

1090
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:19,276
Pompous old cow

1091
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,198
- What was that?
- l said l'm just going now

1092
01:08:32,080 --> 01:08:34,036
Hey, you not speak nothing?

1093
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:38,876
He is not knowing the English as
well as what we are knowing

1094
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:43,793
- l speak with him
- Blimey, he speak Hungryarian

1095
01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:48,114
Sure l speak Hunarian

1096
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:51,280
- Football - Football

1097
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,273
- Puskas - Pele

1098
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,231
- Kepkens - Beckenball

1099
01:08:55,360 --> 01:08:57,032
- Bobby Lee Shutkan - Bobby Lee Moor

1100
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,431
You see, l told you
l speak the language

1101
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:05,791
You like England?

1102
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,555
Ya! l also very much like teacher

1103
01:09:09,360 --> 01:09:13,239
- You not make the eyes at
Mr. Brown - lf l want l will

1104
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,831
Mr. Brown does not like the blond ladies

1105
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,356
Swedish girls are the beautifullest

1106
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:23,118
Swedish girls are too big in the bosoms

1107
01:09:23,240 --> 01:09:24,912
French girls are too big in the mouth

1108
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,155
ln China, looks are not important

1109
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:31,032
lt is brains and intellect that matter

1110
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:33,230
- Absolument - Su Lee is right

1111
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:35,430
We women are not symbols for sex

1112
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:39,117
- You agree Jamila? - l not understand

1113
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:41,879
We Women are not here to
give the men the pleasure

1114
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,676
l like give men pleasure

1115
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:48,835
Trying to find a few winners?

1116
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,829
No l'm trying to find out if
l can afford to leave the wife

1117
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,757
- Pardon? - Premium bonds

1118
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:57,110
A hundred thousand pounds!
l could be lucky

1119
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:58,275
Somebody's got to win it

1120
01:09:58,480 --> 01:10:00,072
- How many bonds have you got? - One

1121
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,794
You're as bad as me! l've only got one

1122
01:10:02,920 --> 01:10:04,831
One, double F, two,
three, two, three, two

1123
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,075
You've got a good memory

1124
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,235
lt's not a difficult one

1125
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,476
One, double F, two,
three, two, three, two

1126
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:10,510
That's right

1127
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,480
- That's it - That's what?

1128
01:10:13,600 --> 01:10:15,670
One, double F, two,
three, two, three, two

1129
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,069
l don't believe it

1130
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:19,156
Are you sure that you
got the right cucumber?

1131
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,315
- Cucumber? - The number

1132
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,996
Positive! Look

1133
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:24,838
One, double F, two,
three, two, three, two

1134
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:26,916
That's right! You've won a
hundred thousand pounds

1135
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:28,632
- What are you going to
do? - What am l going to do

1136
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:29,795
Celebrate of course

1137
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:31,753
- Gladys - Yes Mr. Brown

1138
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,790
Coffees all round

1139
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,190
Everybody please! l want to read
you all my letter of resignation

1140
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,439
No, no! l'm definitely resigning

1141
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,199
With one hundred thousand pounds,
l no longer need to teach English

1142
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:54,355
Dear Dracula

1143
01:10:56,640 --> 01:10:57,629
This is to inform you

1144
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,639
That l think you are a rude, obnoxious
and self-opinionated old dragon

1145
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,476
And if l ever see you again,
it will be too soon

1146
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,592
Yours disrespectfully,
Jeremy Brown

1147
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:11,313
- Ali - Yes please

1148
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:14,757
See that Miss Courtney
gets this straight away

1149
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:16,070
Jelly good

1150
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:18,950
Thank you

1151
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,673
- Please - Oh yes Zoltan, your letter

1152
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:32,158
Glad, where's Sid's paper?

1153
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,515
- He went and took it with
him - Took it with him?

1154
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,870
- l got a paper Mr. Brown
- Great Max, thank you

1155
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,952
Here it is, one hundred thousand pounds

1156
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,552
Today's number is One E, F, two, three

1157
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,557
Wait a minute! That's not
right! lt should be one double F

1158
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,276
We apologize for the misprint
printed out early in the day

1159
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:58,394
l have not won anything

1160
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,430
- So you won't be resignating
after all - Resigning

1161
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:06,749
That letter...

1162
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:09,910
Hello please

1163
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:11,993
Ali, the letter to Miss Courtney

1164
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,872
- She is not in the office - Thank God

1165
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,550
Mr. Brown, Mr. Nadim!
Did you want to see me?

1166
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:18,591
- No - Yes please! This is for you

1167
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:19,630
Thank you

1168
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,953
l'd like a word with you Mr. Brown

1169
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:22,990
l'll have you in the office

1170
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,430
Close the door

1171
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:31,273
l'll just see what this letter is first

1172
01:12:31,560 --> 01:12:34,472
l wouldn't do that! You don't know where
it's been! lt could be full of germs

1173
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,874
Don't be so ridiculous

1174
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:39,395
l seem to recognize this writing

1175
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,070
lt looks like yours, Mr. Brown

1176
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:43,952
No, it's nothing like
mine! ltjust looks like mine

1177
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:47,117
- Well l'd better open it - l think l'll go

1178
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:48,275
l haven't finished with you yet

1179
01:12:48,480 --> 01:12:49,879
You will have when you read that letter

1180
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,558
- l beg you pardon? - Nothing

1181
01:12:58,840 --> 01:12:59,750
Good Heavens

1182
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,749
Miss Courtney

1183
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:03,677
l've never read anything like it in my life

1184
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:05,957
- l can explain... - Just listen to this

1185
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:06,990
l'd rather not

1186
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,596
Dear Miss, l'm writing to tell
you of my feelings for you

1187
01:13:11,720 --> 01:13:13,517
You see l thought l'd won... Pardon?

1188
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:17,640
l want to hold you in my
arms and kiss you

1189
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:21,632
You did write this letter Mr. Brown

1190
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:22,749
Well l... Not to you

1191
01:13:22,880 --> 01:13:25,792
lt's the letter you wrote for
that Hungarian student

1192
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,480
- Yes, you see what must have
happened - You don't need to go on

1193
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:32,589
Obviously he's been
smitten by my charm and beauty

1194
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,432
- Pardon? - l have told
you before Mr. Brown

1195
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:41,071
l do have a strange
fascination for the opposite sex

1196
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,758
Oh yes very strange

1197
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:47,076
You may not believe this, Mr. Brown

1198
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:51,553
But when l was a young
girl l was very plain

1199
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,709
A cup of tea Gladys please

1200
01:14:01,680 --> 01:14:03,113
Everything ok, Mr. Brown?

1201
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:06,596
Yes! l must have put Zoltan's letter to his
girl friend in my envelop to Miss Courtney

1202
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,552
- He's not going to be very happy
- Why not?

1203
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,158
He's gonna give the letter you write

1204
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:00,277
There you are love Thank you

1205
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,799
Sugars on the table

1206
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,194
Give us a cup of tea, Glad

1207
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:08,150
One of these days Sid,
you'll actually buy one

1208
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,356
And l'll drop dead of shock

1209
01:16:10,480 --> 01:16:12,118
- Buy one? - Yes

1210
01:16:12,240 --> 01:16:15,789
Free tea is one of the
perks what goes with the job

1211
01:16:15,920 --> 01:16:18,275
There 'Ow are you fixed
for a quick touch?

1212
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,392
- l beg your pardon? - l mean money

1213
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,038

1214
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:26,152
You're always skink Sid! l'm sorry! No

1215
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:31,072
- Hello lads - Hello Sid

1216
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,152
How are you, my old Japan?

1217
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,275
- Japan? - My old Japan

1218
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,755
Your rhyming slang meaning friend

1219
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:44,313
Not Japan! China, china plate - mate

1220
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:45,670
Jelly good

1221
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,073

1222
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,151

1223
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,355
- Sorry please - lt's alright

1224
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,278
Gladys, give us that pack of
cards from under the counter

1225
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,435
l'll get some money somehow

1226
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:03,990
What are you going to do?

1227
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:06,675
A little game of find the lady

1228
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,956
Nobody might want to play

1229
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:12,275
They'll be enough to play when
l give them the old come on

1230
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,355
Come on what?

1231

- You know l've got a
quid till pay day - Yeah

1232
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:19,277
lf l get somebody to win that, it
can't stop! lt never fails

1233
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:21,399
Now all l've got to do now is find a mug

1234
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,278
- Coffee please - Hello mug... Max

1235
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:28,834
- Max, would you... - No Sid

1236
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:30,799
No, no! l'm not trying to tap you

1237
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:34,152
- l thought you might fancy a game
of cards - l don't like to gamble

1238
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:38,314
Don't be silly! lt's just a bit of fun!
Come and sid down! Enjoy yourself

1239
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,994
This is called Find the Lady!

1240
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:47,349
The lady is a queen! Now there's a
queen and there's the other 2 cards

1241
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,229
What l do is l shuffle them about

1242
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:54,234
And the object is to see if
my eyes could deceive your eyes

1243
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,797
The quickness of my hands
deceive your eyes

1244
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,354
- Where is it? - There

1245
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:05,359
Oh you're right! Very good! You
have good sharp eyes, haven't you?

1246
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,750
Sure l have

1247
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:09,914
You would have another go! Yes?

1248
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:12,752
- Where is it? - This one

1249
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,358
Twice on the turn! You are
very very good, aren't you?

1250
01:18:18,920 --> 01:18:21,275
- Pretty smart, eh? - No
one's ever beaten me twice

1251
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:25,276
l'll tell you what! lf we had any
money, you'd have one two quids now

1252
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:27,958
- Two quids? - Yeah

1253
01:18:28,080 --> 01:18:30,150
- Do you want to try again? - Hockay

1254
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:35,439
- Only this time, l bet a pound
- l thought you said you don't play

1255
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:39,198
My father he teach me
two rules of gambling

1256
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:41,436
First rule, always bet on a certainty

1257
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:46,359
- You want this pound? - Yes,
there's nothing wrong with that

1258
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:47,390
Why not?

1259
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:49,432
Now there's the queen!
There's the cards!

1260
01:18:49,560 --> 01:18:52,279
- Where is it? - This is the lady

1261
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:56,278
Three times on the trot!
That's fantastic!

1262
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,310
l like this game Sid

1263
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:58,875
- Do you like it? - Yes

1264
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:00,752
- Good! Double or Quits? - Quits

1265
01:19:01,840 --> 01:19:02,750
What?

1266
01:19:04,080 --> 01:19:06,674
- l dont want to play
anymore - But you can't do that

1267
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:11,279
The second rule my father tell me!
Always quits when you're winning

1268
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:18,278
Good evening please

1269
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:21,276
Ah Ranjeet! You're late! l
thought you weren't coming!

1270
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:22,879
You missed first half of the session

1271
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:27,393
A thousand apologies but l am
falling asleep on the underground tube

1272
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:30,313
l am going right past
my getting off stop

1273
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:34,274
- And not waking up until
Cockiefosters - Cockiefosters?

1274
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,391
- Perhaps you're working too hard
- l am working three times too hard

1275
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:40,275
What do you mean?

1276
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:44,359
Well my properjob is working on
the underground railway tube

1277
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,311
And l'm working the
early morning shaft

1278
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,198
- l think you mean shift - That is correct

1279
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,438
l am working from six o'clock morning
time until two o'clock afternoon time

1280
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,310
Then l'm doing otherjob for garage

1281
01:19:57,560 --> 01:20:00,916
Pumping the petrol until
six o'clock evening time

1282
01:20:01,400 --> 01:20:03,118
Even allowing for the
time you spend here

1283
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,309
You could still have eight hours sleep

1284
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,115
Oh no, when l am leaving here,

1285
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:10,118
l am working in public house
until after the midnight

1286
01:20:11,080 --> 01:20:12,433
l think you're overdoing it Ranjeet

1287
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,915
All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy

1288
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,278
This Jack, is he having three jobs also?

1289
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,436
lt's just a saying!
Why are you working so hard?

1290
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,956
l'm saving up for the airplane

1291
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:26,116
- You want to buy an airplane?
- No, no

1292
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:27,798
Just a ticket, to Punjab

1293
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,311
You're not leaving us, are you?

1294
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:31,793
Only for one weekend

1295
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:34,434
My mother is being sixty
years old this week

1296
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:38,314
So l am giving her the
big surprise of myself

1297
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:42,357
l am now having the
money for the airplane ticket

1298
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,388
Two hundred and thirty
English pounds

1299
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,797
That's a lot of money
to carry about Ranjeet

1300
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,831
You could get mugged
on your way home

1301
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:52,277
You are speaking absolute wisdom

1302
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,833
- Here, you keep for me - Me?

1303
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,194
Most definitely,
then if l am being mugged

1304
01:20:57,320 --> 01:20:58,799
The mugger man will not find money

1305
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:03,073
- lt's too big a responsibility - Please

1306
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,394
You keep for me until tomorrow

1307
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,991
- Then l buy ticket - Very well

1308
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:08,879
Thousand thank you

1309
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:12,720
Right! Come along everyone!
We have a lot of work to do

1310
01:21:13,560 --> 01:21:14,390
Quickly now! Go on

1311
01:21:15,240 --> 01:21:19,870
Right! Now, for the rest of this
evening, we're going to have a debate

1312
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:23,275
Can anyone tell me what the
word debate means

1313
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:26,358
And l don't want to hear anybody say
debate is what you put on the fishing line

1314
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,994
Can anybody tell me what a debate is?

1315
01:21:31,080 --> 01:21:33,799
Come along! Su Lee, what
is parliament noted for?

1316
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:37,152
Collupt poriticians making unjust
raws to oppless working crasses

1317
01:21:38,160 --> 01:21:40,276
Agreed! We call that debating

1318
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,436
Quite simply it means to
discuss or dispute a given subject

1319
01:21:42,920 --> 01:21:44,194
That is what we are going to do

1320
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,151
Do you understand what we
are talking about Zoltan?

1321
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:47,958
No understand

1322
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,877
We're going to have a debate
- an argument

1323
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,911
- Fight? - No, no

1324
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,436
Not with fists, with mouth

1325
01:21:55,160 --> 01:22:00,792
- Kiss - No, with words

1326
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,672
Just do your best to follow us

1327
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,277
Now the first thing we're going to do!

1328
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:07,277
We're going to need
somebody to chair the debate

1329
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:09,312
- l'm good at that - Have you done it before?

1330
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,992
Sure, every Saturday, l
go to chair my football team

1331
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:16,151
l'm talking about chair, not cheer

1332
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,389
- Scusi - Right

1333
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:18,875
l shall be the Chairman

1334
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:22,231
- Now what subject shall we debate? - Girls

1335
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,798
Girls is not a subject

1336
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:28,195
Subjects for debates are
in the form of questions

1337
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:32,029
For example, should men and
women have equal pay for equal work?

1338
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:34,276
Should capital punishment
be brought back?

1339
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:36,391
Should Enoch Powell be deported?

1340
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:39,399
Thats the general idea

1341
01:22:39,560 --> 01:22:42,438
For our debate, l think we'll
take the subject of Television

1342
01:22:42,920 --> 01:22:47,232
ls Television a good or bad
influence on the community?

1343
01:22:48,160 --> 01:22:51,357
Now we need two proposers
and two opposers

1344
01:22:51,480 --> 01:22:54,677
ln other words, two to
speak for good and two for bad

1345
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:57,435
- How about you Juan? - Por favore

1346
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:03,279
- Good or bad? - Sometimes l'm good

1347
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,434
Sometimes l'm bad

1348
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:10,198
Not talking about you personally Juan!

1349
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:12,117
Do you think television is good?

1350
01:23:12,240 --> 01:23:15,869
Sometimes good, sometimes bad

1351
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,197
Make your mind up Juan

1352
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,151
ln a debate, you can't sit on the fence

1353
01:23:23,160 --> 01:23:27,039
Not sitting on fence! Sitting on chair

1354
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,118
Look forget l asked you

1355
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,676
- What you ask me? - Forget it

1356
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,913
How can l forget if l don't remember

1357
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,072
- Never mind - Alright

1358
01:23:39,000 --> 01:23:42,436
- Taro you can be the 1st proposer - Ah so

1359
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:48,436
Now we need a lady, Jamila! You
can be the 2nd proposer

1360
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,317
Now two opposers

1361
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,389
- Ali, How about you? - Yes please

1362
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:56,312
And Danielle

1363
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,353
- Am l good or bad? - Bad

1364
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:03,234
l like being bad! Because
when l am bad, l'm very good

1365
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:08,198
Just remember, we're talking
about television

1366
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:09,275
Now, pay attention everyone

1367
01:24:09,400 --> 01:24:13,359
Taro will speak first with the proposition
that television is good for the community

1368
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,232
- Go ahead Taro - Ah so

1369
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,790
Television is very goodo for everyone

1370
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:26,754
More people watcho, more people buyo

1371
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:31,711
And Japan make besto television

1372
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:34,800
Japan make besto everything

1373
01:24:35,480 --> 01:24:40,190
- Cars, cameras, radios...
- Thank you Taro

1374
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:43,278
Remember you're speaking about
television not doing a commercial for Japan

1375
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,310
Ah so

1376
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:51,915
Television is goodo for teaching

1377
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:57,349
l learn many English words fromo television

1378
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,880
Like 'what a gay day'

1379
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:08,999
And 'Don't forget fruito gums mum'

1380
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:11,150
Thank you Taro

1381
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:16,996
Danielle, would you please
present your case against television

1382
01:25:17,480 --> 01:25:18,390
Oui

1383
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:23,074
l think television is very bad

1384
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,232
Because it makes people stay up at night

1385
01:25:26,560 --> 01:25:29,279
lnstead of going to bed to make love

1386
01:25:31,240 --> 01:25:33,879
Not everybody wants to go
to bed to make love

1387
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:38,155
That's right! Sometimes, it's
much better to make love outside

1388
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:44,359
ln Sweden, we make love everywhere

1389
01:25:45,840 --> 01:25:50,277
l think we're getting... You do that?

1390
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,914
Getting off the subject! Now, come along!

1391
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,871
Make love much better proposition
than television

1392
01:26:00,000 --> 01:26:02,878
Stick to the point please Danielle

1393
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,277
l think television is very bad for the eyes

1394
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,070
Yes and also bad for the legs

1395
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:12,829
- Legs? - Si

1396
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:17,233
My brother Miguel, he had
bad legs from his television

1397
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:21,189
Juan, how can your brother have
bad legs from his television?

1398
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:22,389
He dropped it on his foot

1399
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:29,197
l shouldn't have asked

1400
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,275
Carry on Danielle

1401
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,039
l cannot sink of anymore to say after this

1402
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:37,119
Jamila, would you like to present your
case for the good of television?

1403
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:42,070
l like very much television

1404
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,791
The television makes people
happy with many good programs

1405
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,319
Like Carnation Street

1406
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:51,959
- Coronation Street - Yes

1407
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:54,150
Last week, l am watching This Week

1408
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,749
How can you be watching
this week last week?

1409
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,800
This Week is the name of
a programme, Ranjeet

1410
01:27:01,160 --> 01:27:02,149
A thousand apologies

1411
01:27:03,440 --> 01:27:06,398
And also, television is for free

1412
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,990
- You have to buy the licence
- What licence?

1413
01:27:11,920 --> 01:27:15,230
- Haven't you got a television
licence? - No, no need licence

1414
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:17,391
- l'm sorry Jamila but you do - No

1415
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:19,877
Look Jamila, it's an
offence not to have a license

1416
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,389
lf the detector van comes
round you could be heavily fined

1417
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:25,312
- No - Don't argue Jamila! lt's the law

1418
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:27,911
- Not for me - Why not for you?

1419
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:30,391
No have television set

1420
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:35,676
Watch next door! They have licence

1421
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:38,955
Thank you Jamila

1422
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:41,719
- Ali, your turn - Jolly good

1423
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:47,232
l am thinking television is very bad

1424
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,358
Because it is showing too
much of the violence

1425
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,353
- A good point - Thank you

1426
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:57,389
Last night, l am seeing
somebody being drowned, then shot

1427
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,388
And then having their heads chopped off

1428
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:03,276
What was that? The Professionals
or Starsky and Hutch?

1429
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:04,989
Tom and Jerry

1430
01:28:07,920 --> 01:28:10,195
Excuse Mr. Brown, can you
spare me a moment?

1431
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:11,275
Just a minute Miss Courtney

1432
01:28:11,400 --> 01:28:12,435
We're running in the middle of
an interesting debate

1433
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,391
- Could you waitjust a minute
please? - Certainly not

1434
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:19,075
- Very well! Giovanni, out here
- Certainly sir

1435
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,319
- Would you take the chair? - Sure

1436
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:28,118
- No l mean will you chair the debate - Scusi

1437
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,356
Let Ali finish, then throw it open! Give
everybody a say then take a vote

1438
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:35,040
lf l'm still not back by then, you
can dismiss the class and go home

1439
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:36,070
Hokey

1440
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:44,074
Okay, you heard what Professori said

1441
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,150
Ali's to finish

1442
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:49,070
We have a talk, we have a vote

1443
01:28:49,480 --> 01:28:52,358
- Then we go home, ok? - Alright

1444
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,433
- You finished Ali? - No l haven't

1445
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:56,391
- l was... - You finished

1446
01:28:58,440 --> 01:28:59,350
Anybody wanna talk?

1447
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:01,069
Ok, we take a vote

1448
01:29:01,480 --> 01:29:04,278
Everybody thinks Tv's okay,
put up hands

1449
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,073
Everybody who think Tv's
not ok, put up the hands

1450
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,434
We call it a draw! Class dismissed

1451
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:16,230
Going somewhere?

1452
01:29:21,240 --> 01:29:22,434
Would you care for a drink Miss Courtney?

1453
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:23,390
No thank you Mr. Brown

1454
01:29:24,240 --> 01:29:26,117
l want to get to the Post
Office to catch the last post

1455
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:27,958
l wonder if you'd post a letter for me

1456
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,069
- Yeah certainly - Good

1457
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:30,390
This is the one

1458
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,311
- Good night Mr. Brown - Good night

1459
01:29:34,560 --> 01:29:37,950
- Another day done, Sid - Worse luck

1460
01:29:38,080 --> 01:29:41,709
- l'm always glad to get home - You
wouldn't be if you lived with my missus

1461
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,232
- Oh hello - What's the matter?

1462
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,959
Here! lt's full of bees and honey

1463
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,198
- l wonder whose it is - l know whose it is now

1464
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:55,960
Don't you think you ought to
take it into the police station?

1465
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:59,390
Don't be ridiculous! lt's finders keepers!

1466
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:00,230
Oh Sid!

1467
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:24,350
Enter!

1468
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:26,949
Mr. Brown

1469
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,356
- Hush - Don't you shush me

1470
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:31,359
Miss Courtney, l'm in terrible trouble

1471
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:33,077
You certainly are! You're ten minutes late!

1472
01:30:33,440 --> 01:30:37,877
Worse than that! l lost 230 pounds that
Ranjeet gave me to look after

1473
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:40,389
- How on earth did you manage
to do that? - l have no idea

1474
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:42,238
lt must have fallen out of my
pocket! l've looked everywhere

1475
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,396
l went to the police to ask
if anyone had handed it in

1476
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:45,830
They just laughed

1477
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:48,954
- What am l gonna tell
Ranjeet? - The truth Mr. Brown

1478
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:50,919
You'd better do it in private

1479
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,353
You can use my office! l'll send him to you

1480
01:30:58,480 --> 01:31:00,277
l suppose the direct approach would be best

1481
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:02,431
Ranjeet, l've lost your money

1482
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:07,319
No, that's too harsh! l
should soften the blow a bit

1483
01:31:07,560 --> 01:31:09,357
Ranjeet, come in

1484
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,350
Have a seat! Would you like a cup of tea?

1485
01:31:13,080 --> 01:31:16,390
Ranjeet, l have something to tell you

1486
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,152
- Are you sitting comfortably?
- No, l'm standing up

1487
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:24,270
Ah Ranjeet, come here and sit down

1488
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,310
Have a cup of tea

1489
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,278
- There isn't any tea
- l'll go and get you a cup

1490
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:29,231
Miss Courtney said you have
something to tell me

1491
01:31:29,360 --> 01:31:32,272
Yes Ranjeet, l am human,
you are human

1492
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,039
And human beings are fallible!
l am fallible, you are fallible

1493
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,111
Oh no, l am Punjabi

1494
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:41,672
What l am trying to say Ranjeet is...

1495
01:31:43,080 --> 01:31:44,229
l've lost your money

1496
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:47,310
Did you hear me?

1497
01:31:47,960 --> 01:31:50,872
The money you saved to go and
visit your mother! l've lost it

1498
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,675
Ranjeet

1499
01:32:04,960 --> 01:32:06,279
l'm sorry Ranjeet

1500
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,231
- Good evening - Hello Sid

1501
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,953
You look as if you've lost a
hundred quid and found ten p.

1502
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,032
There's many a true word spoken in jest

1503
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:22,388
Come on! Cheer up

1504
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:24,038
- Have a cigar - No thanks

1505
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:26,670
- Things can't be that bad
- They're worse

1506
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:29,196
Look at me! Yesterday
l hadn't got change for 1/2 p

1507
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,151
Today, l could lose a tenner and not notice

1508
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:33,317
You couldn't lend me two hundred and
thirty pounds, could you?

1509
01:32:33,440 --> 01:32:34,350
No chance

1510
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:36,189
That's all there was in the envelope

1511
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:42,279
- What envelope? - The envelope
l found outside the school

1512
01:32:42,840 --> 01:32:45,798
- You thief - What are you talking about?

1513
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:47,114
That was Ranjeet's money!

1514
01:32:47,240 --> 01:32:48,309
- You still got it? - Yeah

1515
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,349
Why didn't you hand it in?

1516
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,434
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Ranjeet, we found your money

1517
01:32:58,320 --> 01:33:01,835
Praise to the Holy Guru

1518
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,954
l will be able to be visiting my mother

1519
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:08,798
Oh, she'd be so happy to be seeing me

1520
01:33:10,480 --> 01:33:12,755
There's only one hundred and
thirty pounds in here

1521
01:33:13,280 --> 01:33:14,190
That's right

1522
01:33:14,560 --> 01:33:16,118
- Where's the other hundred? - Here

1523
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,273
- What is this? - A betting slip

1524
01:33:19,240 --> 01:33:23,313
l put in on Rainbows end on the
6:15 in the night race at Windsor

1525
01:33:23,440 --> 01:33:29,310
6:15! We can still make it lads! Come
on everybody quickly! Quickly

1526
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,998
Mr. Brown, what is going on?

1527
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:38,238
We're just taking an early tea
break in the betting shop

1528
01:33:41,280 --> 01:33:43,236
6:15 at Windsor

1529
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:49,110
The horses are lining up for
the start and they're off

1530
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,275
Come on Rainbows End

1531
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:52,277
And right away it's
Ernies Boy in the lead

1532
01:33:52,400 --> 01:33:54,834
Followed by Debs Delight, Golden
Wonder and Skylark

1533
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:57,315
Then come Royal Peacock and Slimline

1534
01:33:57,440 --> 01:33:58,236
Where is Rainbows End?

1535
01:33:58,360 --> 01:34:00,157
And bringing up the rear is Rainbows End

1536
01:34:02,120 --> 01:34:03,348
And that's the order at the bend

1537
01:34:03,800 --> 01:34:07,110
With Debs Delight closing a little and
Skylark now overtaking Golden Wonder

1538
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,032
Royal Peacock is dropping back

1539
01:34:09,160 --> 01:34:10,878
And who's this coming
through on the inside

1540
01:34:11,000 --> 01:34:12,069
- Rainbows End? - Slimline

1541
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,793
And as they come into the straight

1542
01:34:14,920 --> 01:34:17,388
lt's still Ernie's Boy,
Debs Delight and Skylark

1543
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,075
And here's Rainbows End making
a run on the outside

1544
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:21,189
Come on Rainbows End

1545
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,072
And with four furlongs
to go its Ernies Boy

1546
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,270
Debs Delight and Rainbows
End now in third place

1547
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:27,233
Ernies Boy is pulling away slightly

1548
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:30,352
But Rainbows End has overtaken Debs
Delight and is challenging strongly

1549
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:33,348
Two furlongs to go and Rainbows
Ends is gaining on Ernies Boy

1550
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,233
They're neck and neck as
they come to the post

1551
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:38,193
And at the finish it's
Rainbows End by a nose

1552
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:41,435
How much are you winning?

1553
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:44,400
At five to two, that's
two hundred and fifty quid

1554
01:34:44,320 --> 01:34:46,276
Hundred for you and the rest for me

1555
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:48,110
Come on! Let's go draw it

1556
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,038
One moment, there's a stewards inquiry

1557
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:54,314
The red flags gone up

1558
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,831
Oh blimey, it's a Russian horse

1559
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:04,074
Rainbows End's been disqualified for
bumping and has lost

1560
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,317
We are losing and l won't
be able to visit my mother

1561
01:35:10,400 --> 01:35:12,197
Poor Ranjeet

1562
01:35:12,440 --> 01:35:15,352
He was so much looking
forward to seeing his mother

1563
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,789
He will see his mother

1564
01:35:17,200 --> 01:35:20,078
But he was going to be
catching plane on Saturday

1565
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:22,350
How can he be getting one
Hundred pounds before then?

1566
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:23,838
We'll get it for him

1567
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,030
Even if we have to beg,
borrow or steal it

1568
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,229
Yes, yes!

1569
01:35:30,280 --> 01:35:31,395
Excuse please

1570
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:32,950
Thank you

1571
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:36,070
You want photograph! Very cheapo

1572
01:35:36,480 --> 01:35:37,879
Three for one poundo

1573
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,193
You buy pretty violets for your pretty wife

1574
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:45,269
- You want pretty violets for your
pretty wife? - No, thanks duckie

1575
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,309
Get your salami sandwiches here

1576
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:51,272
All made with French bread

Come on young man! Have your fortune

1580
01:36:03,280 --> 01:36:06,113
Have your fortune told

1581
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:08,913

01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:28,188
That's not the lady, i'm telling
you! That's the lady here

1584
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:31,838

show you can be wrong

1585
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,188
You can't be wrong all the time

1586

1588
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,874
Mr. Brown, please hold! Please hold

1589
01:36:56,520 --> 01:36:58,431
- Good evening Miss Courtney
- Good evening Mr. Brown

1590
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:02,039
l hear you managed to raise
the money for Mr. Singhs fare

1591
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:03,798
Yes, he'll be at the airport now

1592
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:07,073
How is he going by plane or balloon?

1593
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,870
- You heard about that! - Yes

1594
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,389
lf there haven't been someone on
the roof to catch my legs

1595
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:14,309
Heaven knows where l'd be now

1596
01:37:15,080 --> 01:37:18,356
Where you usually are Mr.
Brown, with your head in the clouds

1597
01:37:23,280 --> 01:37:25,430
- Good evening class
- Good evening Mr. Brown

1598
01:37:26,400 --> 01:37:28,994
Firstly, may l say thank you for
all your efforts yesterday

1599
01:37:29,120 --> 01:37:30,348
To help me raise the fare for Ranjeet

1600
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:32,990
No, no! lt was a remarkable effort

1601
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:35,273
l wish l could say that for your homework

1602
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:41,237
- l'm not happy with your answers -
We are also not happy with the questions

1603
01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:45,111
l got an idea

1604
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,351
You're not happy, we're not happy

1605
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,389
So if you not give us homework,
we both be happy

1606
01:37:52,240 --> 01:37:53,355
Silence

1607
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:56,033
Look, in the future, you will
be given extra homework

1608
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:57,354
And l hope to see some improvement

1609
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,154
Some of you are simply not trying

1610
01:37:59,560 --> 01:38:00,959
For example, Max

1611
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:05,350
The opposite of anti-meridian is
not uncle-meridian but post-meridian

1612
01:38:07,360 --> 01:38:10,238
What you're laughing about Giovanni

1613
01:38:10,480 --> 01:38:14,393
Your answer to the question write a sentence
using a metaphor was unbelievable

1614
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,834
But l did write a sentence using a metaphor

1615
01:38:17,960 --> 01:38:21,111
Yes, last night l found my
girlfriend in a metaphoradream

1616
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:26,873
- Ali - Yes please

1617
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:29,070
For your information, a polygon is a term

1618
01:38:29,200 --> 01:38:31,350
used to describe figures
with angles and sides

1619
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:34,074
and has nothing to do with
the disappearing parrot

1620
01:38:36,920 --> 01:38:39,354
Mr. Brown, Miss would
like to have a word with you

1621
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:40,390
Ah, new pupil

1622
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:41,915
Would you like to sit over there?

1623
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:43,871
No sit! Look for Ranjeet

1624
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:46,275
Well l'm afraid he's not here!
He's gone this weekend to visit his mother

1625
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,034
As a surprise for her birthday

1626
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:49,434
That is terrible

1627
01:38:49,880 --> 01:38:51,359
- Why, what's the matter?
- l am his mother

1628
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:56,274
l came over for my birthday
to surprise Ranjeet

1629
01:38:56,400 --> 01:38:59,358
You're his mother?

1630
01:40:53,000 --> 01:40:54,399
Hello, is that Parkers?

1631
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,674
Look, l'm going fishing this
weekend and l need some bait

1632
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:00,880
No, just on the Thames,
the maggots will do

1633
01:41:01,000 --> 01:41:02,228
l'll send somebody round to collect them

1634
01:41:02,920 --> 01:41:06,754
Oh by the way, those trout flies l bought
from you have been very successful

1635
01:41:07,240 --> 01:41:08,798
Especially the cochy-bondu

1636
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,674
Seems to attract the trout like a magnet

1637
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,274
Yes, thank you again

1638
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:14,396
Bye

1639
01:41:20,880 --> 01:41:21,790
Excuse me

1640
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:24,112
You startled me

1641
01:41:24,240 --> 01:41:25,958
Would you mind knocking
before you barge in?

1642
01:41:26,320 --> 01:41:27,196
Sorry

1643
01:41:31,320 --> 01:41:32,355
ls that better?

1644
01:41:32,280 --> 01:41:34,316
- l've lost it - Lost what?

1645
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,199
l've lost my favorite fly

1646
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:38,038
l had it in my hand a moment
ago! l must have dropped it

1647
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:39,195
Can you see it anywhere?

1648
01:41:39,320 --> 01:41:40,196
What does it look like?

1649
01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,273
lt's about two inches long; red
and black with a curly tail

1650
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:46,278
Perhaps it's flown out of the window

1651
01:41:47,080 --> 01:41:50,117
lt's a fishing fly! A cochy bondu

1652
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:51,798
- A cochy what? - Bondu

1653
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,270
- lt must be here somewhere
- lf it's here, we'll find it

1654
01:41:57,160 --> 01:41:58,388
Perhaps l should come back later

1655
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:01,155
Ah Mr. Brown, you can join in

1656
01:42:01,880 --> 01:42:03,233
Well l'm not really that religious

1657
01:42:05,400 --> 01:42:07,311
We're looking for a fly

1658
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:08,676
A fly?

1659
01:42:09,080 --> 01:42:12,709
Yes! lt's 2 inches long! Red
and black with a curly tail

1660
01:42:13,320 --> 01:42:14,230
Sounds quite lethal

1661
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:16,950
- Would you mind helping us
look for it - No, not at all

1662
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,316
- l found it - Where?

1663
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:19,869
lt's here! Just under the desk

1664
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:22,309
- l'll get it - No, stand
back Sid! Leave this to me

1665
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:24,315
What are you doing Mr. Brown?

1666
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:26,358
Stay where you are Miss
Courtney! lt could be dangerous

1667
01:42:26,520 --> 01:42:28,397
Yeah that's right! lt's not moving!

1668
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,313
- Mr. Brown... - Just a moment

1669
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:32,036
Better to be safe than sorry

1670
01:42:36,080 --> 01:42:40,119
l've just remembered! l've
been expecting the boiler

1671
01:42:42,320 --> 01:42:44,038
Have you quite finished Mr. Brown?

1672
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:46,276
Or would you like to borrow a hammer?

1673
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,356
One can't be too careful where
strange insects are concerned

1674
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,869
Have you any idea where it came from?

1675
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:52,195
- Yes! W. Parker and Son - Pardon?

1676
01:42:52,360 --> 01:42:55,113
- Fishing tackle suppliers - Fishing

1677
01:42:56,800 --> 01:42:58,313
- lt wasn't... - lt was

1678
01:42:58,440 --> 01:42:59,395
Oh dear!

1679
01:42:59,800 --> 01:43:00,676
Got any glue?

1680
01:43:01,240 --> 01:43:02,434
l don't think trout are
particularly fond of glue

1681
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:03,876
No l suppose they're not!

1682
01:43:04,400 --> 01:43:06,038
- l'll buy you another - See that you do

1683
01:43:06,400 --> 01:43:07,355
Excuse me

1684
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:10,717
Hello... Speaking

1685
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,396
Pardon?

1686
01:43:14,360 --> 01:43:15,236
ls it you?

1687
01:43:16,080 --> 01:43:17,308
ls it really you?

1688
01:43:18,360 --> 01:43:20,396
lt is you... lt's him

1689
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:24,795
Coming here?

1690
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:27,388
You're not coming here

1691
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,389
You are coming here... He's coming here

1692
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:34,030
Yes, yes, yes... Half an hour

1693
01:43:34,280 --> 01:43:36,316
You'll be here in half an hour

1694
01:43:36,440 --> 01:43:37,919
He'll be here in half an hour

1695
01:43:38,280 --> 01:43:41,795
Very well... until then

1696
01:43:44,920 --> 01:43:47,434
- ls everything all right? - lt was him

1697
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,035
Yes and he's coming here in half an hour

1698
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:50,388
But who is him... l mean who is he?

1699
01:43:50,520 --> 01:43:52,317
A man l never thought l'd see again

1700
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:54,275
My ex-fiance

1701
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:56,957
You mean you were actually
engaged at one time?

1702
01:43:57,080 --> 01:43:58,308
There's no need to sound so surprised

1703
01:44:00,440 --> 01:44:06,310
lt was over twenty-five years
ago... l was just...

1704
01:44:07,880 --> 01:44:09,199
l was very young

1705
01:44:10,160 --> 01:44:12,720
l met him at Oxford in the high!

1706
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:15,390
lt was raining and he offered
me shelter under his umbrella

1707
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:18,318
Then he insisted on buying me a
cup of tea and a sticky bun

1708
01:44:18,880 --> 01:44:22,031
- How romantic - Yes,
that was how it all started

1709
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,390
- Why didn't you get married?
- lt was awful! He left me

1710
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:25,953
- At the church? - No, in the lurch

1711
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:29,792
Mr. Brown, l have never
told anyone this before

1712
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:32,275
- Well if you'd rather... - No, sit down

1713
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,236
For years, l've kept this
terrible secret to myself

1714
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,111
Now he's coming back into my
life l must tell someone

1715
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:41,958
And l think l can trust you Mr. Brown

1716
01:44:42,080 --> 01:44:43,957
l'd rather not if it's going to
cause any embarrassment

1717
01:44:44,080 --> 01:44:45,399
- lt won't embarrass me
- lt might embarrass me

1718
01:44:45,880 --> 01:44:46,869
l'm sure it won't

1719
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,357
Anyway, he asked me to go
down to Brighton with him

1720
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:52,870
For one of those
- you know - weekends

1721
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,309
- Double room, Mr. And Mrs. Smith?
- Exactly

1722
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:57,317
- And you refused? - Oh no, l went

1723
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:01,038
l even remember the hotel

1724
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:05,433
- The Bellavista, opposite the
abatoir - Very Bellavista

1725
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:10,278
Well, we booked in and Albert, like
the thoughtful man he was

1726
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,393
He let me go upstairs first to
prepare myself as it were

1727
01:45:14,800 --> 01:45:16,313
While he had a drink in the bar

1728
01:45:16,440 --> 01:45:20,319
- Getting up a bit of dutch
courage - l beg your pardon?

1729
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:23,398
Not that he needed it with such
a lovely person waiting to be

1730
01:45:23,800 --> 01:45:25,233
- What happened then?
- He didn't turn up

1731
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:31,199
He got drunk, passed out and spent the
night on a settee in the resident's lounge

1732
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:32,389
How despicable!

1733
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:35,080
l went home and refused
ever to see him again

1734
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:38,758
l heard later that he
was working in the Far East

1735
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:40,389
But l must admit

1736
01:45:41,000 --> 01:45:44,879
l have always cherished a secret
hope that he might one day come back

1737
01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:48,231
- Excuse me please - Yes Ali, what is it?

1738
01:45:48,360 --> 01:45:51,796
Come quickly please we are
having plenty trouble in classroom

1739
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:54,036
- What do you mean, trouble?
- Max and Giovanni

1740
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:55,878
They are murdering each other

1741
01:45:57,400 --> 01:45:59,709
- l'm ready when you are -
l am ready when you are

1742
01:46:02,800 --> 01:46:03,676
You come on

1743
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:08,074
You're gonna be sorry

1744
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,074
We see whose gonna be sorry

1745
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:13,238
Okay, l'm waiting for you to come on

1746
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:16,113
Stop this brawling

1747
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:19,317
lt's lucky for you! Professori stop
me from giving you a black eye

1748
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:23,357
l will not have fighting in class

1749
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:25,874
Fighting! lt was more like dancing

1750
01:46:26,800 --> 01:46:28,392
- l was just warming up - Me too

1751
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,230
- What was this all about?
- l tell you professori

1752
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,157
He was calling me a wop

1753
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,393
And he's calling me a grease boy

1754
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:38,878
Go on, sit down everybody

1755
01:46:39,240 --> 01:46:41,674
l wish you could pick up proper
English as quickly as you pick up slang

1756
01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,753
l have enough trouble with Ali and
Ranjeet without you two start falling out

1757
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:45,790
Now shake hands, come on

1758
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,878
Right! Now, tonight l want to
concentrate on English conversation

1759
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:52,275
The sort of things you have to
say during the course of the day

1760
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,358
For example Ranjeet

1761
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:56,748
- Where would you take a
cheque? - To Czechoslovakia

1762
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,037
- Not that sort of Czech
- A thousand apologies

1763
01:47:06,160 --> 01:47:07,309
A cheque for a certain amount of money

1764
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:09,271
- Where would you take it? - To a bank

1765
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:11,277
- Thank you! Juan - Si senor

1766
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,034
- lf you felt ill, what
would you do? - Go to bed

1767
01:47:16,320 --> 01:47:18,675
- Before that - Take the clothes off

1768
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:22,434
- You would go to the doctor's - No, no, no

1769
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:24,791
Doctor kill my uncle in Madrid

1770
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:27,355
- Really? - Si

1771
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:31,274
My uncle, he has pain in the
chest! He goes to see doctor

1772
01:47:31,400 --> 01:47:34,949
Doctor he looks at him and say...
lt's alright

1773
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:39,193
Ten minutes later, in the
street, my uncle... finito

1774
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:42,196
- He got a heart attack? - Motor car

1775
01:47:45,240 --> 01:47:47,276
You could hardly blame
the doctor for that

1776
01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,229
Si, si, the doctor,
he was driving the motor

1777
01:47:55,160 --> 01:47:56,309
- Taro - Ah so

1778
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:59,237
Although we have news
metrics in this country

1779
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:01,794
We still use an old
system which is known as what?

1780
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:06,029
- Sorry not know
- Does anybody know?

1781
01:48:07,240 --> 01:48:08,195
Avoirdupois

1782
01:48:08,360 --> 01:48:10,032
- Excellent - Merci

1783
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:13,197
- Does avoirdupois ring a
bell now Taro? - Yes

1784
01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:17,956
Avoirdupois is French for
have you some peaso

1785
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,317
Taro, l can't believe you're that stupid

1786
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,314
Sorry, justjoko

1787
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:32,231
Well in future, kindly leave
yourjoko's at homo

1788
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:36,197
- Zoltan, l'm gonna ask you
a question - Yes please

1789
01:48:36,320 --> 01:48:37,355
- Which shop... - yes, shop, shop

1790
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:41,952
Which shop would you go to to buy
a packet of cigarettes? Cigarettes

1791
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:43,395
No shop

1792
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:45,876
Come on Zoltan! You must go to some
sort of shop

1793
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:47,752
Zoltan no smoke

1794
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:54,035
Excuse! Zoltan, where you
go for chewing gum?

1795
01:48:54,920 --> 01:49:00,870
- Ah, sveet shop - Sweet, sweet

1796
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:04,390
- Anna tells me sveet - No, sweet, sweet

1797
01:49:05,080 --> 01:49:07,116
Sveet, sweet! What's the difference?

1798
01:49:07,520 --> 01:49:11,274
The difference Anna is that you
must learn to say wer, not Ver! Wer

1799
01:49:11,800 --> 01:49:12,676
Verwer

1800
01:49:14,000 --> 01:49:15,194
You nearly got it then! Try again

1801
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:16,315
Verwer

1802
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:18,871
Try saying Verwer without the Ver

1803
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:19,955
Erwer

1804
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:25,439
Almost! Try again but this
time don't say Erwer, just wer

1805
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,308
- Wer - Wer

1806
01:49:27,440 --> 01:49:28,793
- Wonderful - Wonderful

1807
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:31,112
- Wednesday - Wednesday

1808
01:49:31,240 --> 01:49:33,754
- A wet weekend in Winter
- A wet weekend in Winter

1809
01:49:34,240 --> 01:49:35,673
- Very good - Werry good

1810
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:40,274
- Ali - Yes please

1811
01:49:41,240 --> 01:49:42,798
- You have a headache - No sir

1812
01:49:43,800 --> 01:49:47,270
Assume you have a headache! Where
would you go to get some aspirin?

1813
01:49:48,080 --> 01:49:49,149
Tanduri takeaway

1814
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:52,271
- No Ali - Yes please

1815
01:49:52,400 --> 01:49:56,188
My jelly good friend who's working
there always have plenty aspirin

1816
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:58,353
l meant to buy some aspirin

1817
01:49:58,800 --> 01:50:03,316
Why should l be buying them when l can be
getting them from my friend for nothing done

1818
01:50:04,320 --> 01:50:08,108
Alright, where do you go for aspirin when
the tanduri takeaway is closed?

1819
01:50:08,280 --> 01:50:10,953
Oh Blimey, Taj Mahal curry house

1820
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:16,192
Jamila, would you please tell
Ali where would you go to get aspirin

1821
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:18,396
- Ok, the chemist - Thank you

1822
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:22,949
- Where are you going now?
- To buy some aspirin for headache

1823
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:26,117
- But you said you don't have a
headache - Oh blimey, l got one now

1824
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:27,355
Oh go and sit down

1825
01:50:28,280 --> 01:50:30,748
Excuse me Mr. Brown,
the old dragon wants you

1826
01:50:30,880 --> 01:50:32,359
Please Sid, do be a little more respectful

1827
01:50:32,280 --> 01:50:33,315
Especially in front of the students

1828
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,793
lt's up to us to set a good example

1829
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:36,036
Sorry

1830
01:50:36,440 --> 01:50:37,714
What does the old dragon...
Miss Courtney want?

1831
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:40,276
l've no idea, but l don't
think she's very well

1832
01:50:40,520 --> 01:50:42,112
She actually smiled at me

1833
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:51,799
Enter

1834
01:50:52,880 --> 01:50:54,279
- Are you feeling alright? - Yes, why?

1835
01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:56,677
- You sounded as if you were
in pain - l was singing

1836
01:50:58,240 --> 01:51:00,959
l am sorry to bring you
away from your class Mr. Brown

1837
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:03,275
But before you leave this evening,
would you mind checking...

1838
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:04,879
that Sid's locked up properly

1839
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,353
Absolutely, so should be

1840
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:10,237
l was referring to the building

1841
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:14,039
You see, it's quite likely that
l may be leaving early

1842
01:51:14,520 --> 01:51:18,274
To think he's come back into
my life after twenty five years

1843
01:51:19,400 --> 01:51:22,039
l think l might need another
cherry to settle my stomach

1844
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:26,234
- What's the matter? - He's here! Look

1845
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,069
- Where? - Down there

1846
01:51:34,160 --> 01:51:37,357
You stupid fool! You have
crowned my Albert

1847
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:57,389
- How do you feel? - l feel terrible

1848
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:59,112
l've got a splitting headache

1849
01:51:59,240 --> 01:52:01,913
l'm sorry! lt was an accident! This
is Miss Courtney's office

1850
01:52:02,400 --> 01:52:05,392
Wait, wait! Look, have you got somewhere
where l could comb my hair?

1851
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:07,033
And brush myself down

1852
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:11,278
l must look presentable for our
first meeting after twenty five years

1853
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:13,277
- Yes of course! lt's down
there on the right - Thank you

1854
01:52:16,800 --> 01:52:17,710
Enter

1855
01:52:19,240 --> 01:52:20,389
Hello darling

1856
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:23,756
Pardon?

1857
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:28,676
lt's you

1858
01:52:29,400 --> 01:52:32,312
Where's Albert? You haven't pushed
him down the stairs, have you?

1859
01:52:32,440 --> 01:52:34,112
No, no! He's just gone to comb his hair

1860
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:36,117
ls he all right? No damage done l hope

1861
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:39,198
- l'm afraid there is - Oh dear, is it bad?

1862
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,309
The plantpot's broken

1863
01:52:42,080 --> 01:52:43,877
l was referring to Albert

1864
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,672
Oh Albert, he's fine

1865
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:47,196
l'll get it

1866
01:52:47,880 --> 01:52:49,279
Darling! Oh it's you

1867
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,916
This is darling... Miss Courtney

1868
01:52:53,800 --> 01:52:55,870
- Albert - Dolores

1869
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,389
Dolores?

1870
01:53:00,400 --> 01:53:02,356
Haven't you a class to attend to?

1871
01:53:02,280 --> 01:53:06,193
Yes of course darling...
Dolores... Excuse me

1872
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:18,356
l've dropped a two p. lt
must have rolled away somewhere

1873
01:53:23,880 --> 01:53:26,030
l'm glad to see you're all working hard

1874
01:53:26,520 --> 01:53:27,839
What are you studying lngrid?

1875
01:53:29,400 --> 01:53:31,436
''How to improve your bust
line''! Very educational

1876
01:53:32,360 --> 01:53:34,954
- You can borrow it if you
wish it - No thank you

1877
01:53:35,880 --> 01:53:37,199
What's keeping you occupied Juan?

1878

''Gals Galore''

1879
01:53:39,160 --> 01:53:40,434
There's not much English in this

1880
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:43,235
No, but some beautiful pictures

1881

l'm sure this isn't about poultry farming

1884
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,069
- But... - Nevermind

1885
01:53:52,520 --> 01:53:54,351

Danielle, ''Toujours L'Amour''

1888
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,231
Don't the French ever think about
anything else other than love?

1889
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,669
To the French, there's is nothing else

1890
01:54:06,440 --> 01:54:08,396
Giovanni, ''L'Amore''

1891
01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:10,950
ln ltaly, we're just like the French

1892
01:54:12,160 --> 01:54:14,116
Ranjeet, ''Cartoon Capers''

1893
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:18,199
l am reading all about Bugs the
Bunny and Woody the pecker

Ali, ''The World's Most Exotic Dishes''

1895
01:54:23,000 --> 01:54:24,877
l didn't know you were
interested in cookery

1896
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:28,310
Oh Blimey, when l am buying it l
didn't know it was about cookery!

1897
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:32,230
Jamila

1898
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:34,279
''Knitting made easy''

1899
01:54:35,400 --> 01:54:38,119
Taro, ''The confessions of a Geisha girl''

1900
01:54:41,160 --> 01:54:42,878
You can all learn English
much more quickly

1901
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:44,956
lf you began by reading a
better class of litterature

1902
01:54:45,080 --> 01:54:47,275
As you're obviously
so keen to learn English

1903
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,992
l'll give you extra homework tonight

1904
01:54:49,520 --> 01:54:52,034
Quiet! lt's time you
took these lessons seriously

1905
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:55,391
Now before we break for tea,
l'm going to ask you each a question

1906
01:54:55,520 --> 01:54:59,718
And anyone who gives an incorrect
answer will be fined 10 p.

1907
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,319
The money will go to charity

1908
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:05,678
Who's this bird charity you're
giving our money to?

1909
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:09,037
Charity is not a bird

1910
01:55:09,160 --> 01:55:13,278
lt means an organization...
a deserving cause

1911
01:55:13,920 --> 01:55:17,674
- Juan, spell ''quiet'' - Por favore

1912
01:55:18,160 --> 01:55:20,913
- Quiet! - Ah quiet

1913
01:55:22,360 --> 01:55:24,396
No spell ''quiet''

1914
01:55:25,280 --> 01:55:27,953
- How much we pay if
we're wrong? - 10 p.

1915
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:35,388
lngrid, give me an example
of a preposition

1916
01:55:37,320 --> 01:55:39,038
Will you to dinner take me?

1917
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:40,957
l said a preposition not a proposition

1918
01:55:42,080 --> 01:55:44,389
A preposition shows the
relation between a noun or pronoun

1919
01:55:44,520 --> 01:55:45,748
And some other word

1920
01:55:45,880 --> 01:55:47,916
A gift from Mary, a house for sale

1921
01:55:48,400 --> 01:55:52,109
- A date with teacher - Yes
all right! l'll accept that

1922
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:55,437
- Good, tonight we go
- l meant l'll accept your answer

1923
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:58,877
Ranjeet, how do you pronounce
the following?

1924
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:02,231
B O U G H, C O U G H, T O U G H

1925
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:04,396
You are trying to be catching me out

1926
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:06,317
- B O U G H - Buff

1927
01:56:07,520 --> 01:56:10,193
- T O U G H - Toff

1928
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,079
- C O U G H - Cow

1929
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:15,389
Three out of three wrong

1930
01:56:16,160 --> 01:56:17,309
Thousand apologies

1931
01:56:19,440 --> 01:56:22,193
Giovanni, what is meant
by vice versa?

1932
01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:23,833
On second thoughts,
l won't ask you that

1933
01:56:25,520 --> 01:56:28,876
- What is a diphtong?
- ls it like a dipstick?

1934
01:56:30,520 --> 01:56:31,714
What do you think?

1935
01:56:32,320 --> 01:56:34,231
l think l owe you ten p.

1936
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,116
Ali what does the term
coup de grace mean?

1937
01:56:38,240 --> 01:56:39,673
And don't you dare say cutting the lawn

1938
01:56:40,520 --> 01:56:42,112
l'm never hearing of it

1939
01:56:42,240 --> 01:56:44,435
lt means the final stroke! lt's French

1940
01:56:45,000 --> 01:56:48,072
Oh blimey, l am having enough
worries learning the English

1941
01:56:50,080 --> 01:56:52,196
lt's a phrase that's in common usage

1942
01:56:52,440 --> 01:56:53,316
Ten p. Please

1943
01:56:54,880 --> 01:56:55,756
Thank you

1944
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:57,713
- Taro - Ah so

1945
01:57:00,160 --> 01:57:01,354
Decline the verb to jump

1946
01:57:02,440 --> 01:57:05,193
l jumpo, you jumpo

1947
01:57:06,240 --> 01:57:08,959
He jumpso, she jumpso

1948
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:11,355
We jumpo, they jumpo

1949
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:12,876
Very good Taro

1950
01:57:13,400 --> 01:57:15,277
But you must try not to
end every word on O

1951
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:18,039
- Ok? - Oko

1952
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:26,829
Cheese! 10 p. Please

1953
01:57:27,320 --> 01:57:30,357
- l am not understanding
- lt's a fairly common phrase

1954
01:57:30,280 --> 01:57:32,840
They are as alike as chalk and cheese

1955
01:57:33,320 --> 01:57:36,312
But chalk and cheese
are not being alike

1956
01:57:36,440 --> 01:57:38,396
Exactly, so it means they are not alike

1957
01:57:38,920 --> 01:57:43,357
l'm thinking it is easier to
say they are not alike

1958
01:57:43,280 --> 01:57:46,113
Than to be talking about
chalks and cheeses

1959
01:57:46,280 --> 01:57:48,350
Yes l admit we do tend to
complicate our language

1960
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:53,271
Max, give me an example
of a principal clause

1961
01:57:54,240 --> 01:57:55,150
Santa Claus

1962
01:57:57,000 --> 01:57:58,035
Quiet

1963
01:57:58,160 --> 01:57:59,354
Just for that Max you can
write out 20 times

1964
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,119
A clause is as sentence which
is part of a longer sentence

1965
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,195
Hockay

1966
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:05,389
Not now, in your own time

1967
01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:06,430
And you can give me 10 p.

1968
01:58:10,240 --> 01:58:11,275
Thank you

1969
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:14,870
Danielle, as handsome
as a Prince! As ugly as?

1970
01:58:16,000 --> 01:58:16,955
A Swede

1971
01:58:18,440 --> 01:58:20,908
As ugly as sin

1972
01:58:21,400 --> 01:58:23,356
- 10 p. - lt was worth it

1973
01:58:26,240 --> 01:58:29,312
Anna give me two different
meanings of the word blow

1974
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,960
You can blow like so

1975
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,675
Or you can give somebody a blow

1976
01:58:40,240 --> 01:58:41,150
Thank you Anna

1977
01:58:42,440 --> 01:58:44,351
- Zoltan - Yes please

1978
01:58:44,880 --> 01:58:47,075
Can you give me the past
tense of the verb to see

1979
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:56,199
- See, saw - Ah, seesaw

1980
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,753
No Zoltan

1981
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:00,788
Today l see, yesterday l saw

1982
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,112
lt's not really fair to
take one from you

1983
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:06,989
Alright then

1984
01:59:08,360 --> 01:59:09,270
80 p. ln 3 minutes

1985
01:59:10,880 --> 01:59:11,790
At this rate, we'll soon
have a small fortune

1986
01:59:12,360 --> 01:59:16,717
- Another cup of tea,
Albert? - No thank you Dolores

1987
01:59:17,360 --> 01:59:22,229
- A glass of cherry perhaps?
- No, l don't drink now! l've given it up

1988
01:59:22,440 --> 01:59:24,351
- lt's a very bad habit - You're so right

1989
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,793
l only keep it for visitors

1990
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:32,876
Oh dear

1991
01:59:33,320 --> 01:59:36,232
Come on Dolores! Think of
something a little more sparkling

1992
01:59:38,080 --> 01:59:39,115
- l wonder... - Yes

1993
01:59:39,240 --> 01:59:40,195
- Will you... - Oh l will

1994
01:59:40,360 --> 01:59:41,429
Pour me another cup of tea

1995
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:44,756
- Tea? - Yes please

1996
01:59:45,320 --> 01:59:47,709
- You said you didn't want any
more - l've changed my mind

1997
01:59:49,160 --> 01:59:51,958
As a matter of fact, there is
something else l'm going to ask you

1998
01:59:52,080 --> 01:59:52,353
Yes

1999
01:59:52,920 --> 01:59:57,277
l know it might seem silly after all this
time and not writing and everything

2000
01:59:57,400 --> 02:00:00,073
- But l never forgot you Dolores - Yes

2001
02:00:01,160 --> 02:00:05,039
l couldn't believe my good fortune tonight
when l discovered you hadn't married

2002
02:00:05,880 --> 02:00:07,108
l never married either

2003
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:08,316
- Didn't you? - No

2004
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:10,718
- Would it be too much to expect... - No

2005
02:00:11,800 --> 02:00:12,869
- l mean would you consider... - Yes

2006
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:16,356
- l mean will you marry me?
- This is so sudden

2007
02:00:18,280 --> 02:00:23,673
- Oh Albert, my cup is overflowing
- So is mine

2008
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:25,276
Oh dear, l'm so sorry

2009
02:00:25,440 --> 02:00:27,032
lt doesn't matter!

2010
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,318
- Well what do you say? Will
you marry me? - Yes please

2011
02:00:31,320 --> 02:00:33,390
l'll get a special license! We
can be married next week

2012
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:34,949
So soon?

2013
02:00:35,080 --> 02:00:37,753
We've already wasted 25 years! We
don't wanna waste any more time

2014
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:40,874
- Wait - What's the matter?

2015
02:00:41,000 --> 02:00:42,115
We can't! We'll have to wait

2016
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,276
My money's still tied up abroad

2017
02:00:44,400 --> 02:00:47,756
lt'll take several weeks to
transfer it over here...

2018
02:00:48,160 --> 02:00:49,070
l've got enough money

2019
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,989
Dolores, l couldn't let you pay for the
wedding and honeymoon and everything

2020
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:56,396
- What's mine is yours
- No, it wouldn't be right

2021
02:00:56,520 --> 02:00:58,431
Nonsense, don't be so proud

2022
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:00,350
l'll tell you what l'll do

2023
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:03,872
l'll use your money on the
strict understanding

2024
02:01:04,400 --> 02:01:07,358
That l pay you back when mine
comes through

2025
02:01:07,280 --> 02:01:10,909
- Very well, if you insist
- l most definitely do

2026
02:01:12,440 --> 02:01:14,271
Oh Albert, l'm so excited

2027
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:19,236
So am l

2028
02:01:23,400 --> 02:01:24,719
Just a moment, l...

2029
02:01:25,360 --> 02:01:28,716
l have a little engagement! l've
got to meet a fellow down the road

2030
02:01:30,240 --> 02:01:32,390
A little business! Lt'll only take a few minutes

2031
02:01:32,520 --> 02:01:37,310
Then l should come back and take you to
dinner somewhere... just the two of us

2032
02:01:38,280 --> 02:01:39,429
That would be lovely

2033
02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:41,239
- Don't go away - Never

2034
02:01:48,080 --> 02:01:48,956
Mind where you're going

2035
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,711
- Albert? - ls everything alright Sid?

2036
02:01:54,320 --> 02:01:55,878
ls everything alright?

2037
02:01:56,360 --> 02:01:59,238
l've just seen a fellow l haven't
seen for years! Albert Collins

2038
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,319
Albert! Miss Courtney's boyfriend

2039
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:03,316
- Never - lt's true

2040
02:02:05,080 --> 02:02:06,274
He's a crook, a con man

2041
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:09,195
You must be mistaken! He's
just come back from the Far East

2042
02:02:09,320 --> 02:02:10,230
He's been away for over 20 years

2043
02:02:10,440 --> 02:02:11,953
He's been away all right, doing porridge

2044
02:02:15,000 --> 02:02:16,115
He's been in prison?

2045
02:02:16,240 --> 02:02:17,958
He was in the nick with my brother-in-law

2046
02:02:18,440 --> 02:02:20,351
He's in and out of there like a fiddlers elbow

2047
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,277
Do you know what his specialty is?

2048
02:02:24,920 --> 02:02:27,354
Finding lonely women,
asking them to marry him

2049
02:02:27,280 --> 02:02:29,032
Taking their life savings and scampering

2050
02:02:31,320 --> 02:02:34,118
l'm getting married in the morning

2051
02:02:35,000 --> 02:02:35,876
Enter

2052
02:02:37,520 --> 02:02:40,956
Ah Miss Courtney, l've got
some rather disturbing news

2053
02:02:41,080 --> 02:02:43,389
Nothing you could say to me
today would disturb Mr. Brown

2054
02:02:43,520 --> 02:02:49,038
- l think this might! lt's about
Albert - Ah Albert, my future husband

2055
02:02:49,160 --> 02:02:51,230
l've just been speaking to
Sid and... Husband?

2056
02:02:51,800 --> 02:02:53,119
Yes, we're getting married
by special license

2057
02:02:53,240 --> 02:02:54,275
Oh no

2058
02:02:54,400 --> 02:02:55,310
Now Mr. Brown,
l know you were fond of me

2059
02:02:56,440 --> 02:02:57,350
But you mustn't take it too hard

2060
02:02:58,160 --> 02:02:59,388
Has he tried to borrow
any money from you?

2061
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:01,877
l fail to see what business that is of yours

2062
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:03,389
He has... l hate to have to
tell you this Miss Courtney

2063
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,398
But your future husband is a crook

2064
02:03:05,840 --> 02:03:08,274
- Don't be so impertinent - lt's true l'm afraid

2065
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:11,915
He's a con man! He specializes in proposing
to lonely women and taking their money

2066
02:03:12,040 --> 02:03:13,234
Nonsense! l don't believe it

2067
02:03:14,000 --> 02:03:15,399
Ask Sid, his brother-in-law was
in prison with him

2068
02:03:16,000 --> 02:03:18,673
- Prison? Are you sure?
- l'm afraid so

2069
02:03:20,080 --> 02:03:23,117
- Perhaps he's reformed
- You don't really believe that, do you?

2070
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,834
No, l thought it was too good to be true

2071
02:03:29,360 --> 02:03:32,352
He's coming back to take me out to dinner

2072
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:34,316
- What shall l do?
- Don't worry Miss Courtney

2073
02:03:34,800 --> 02:03:35,676
l'll deal with him

2074
02:03:36,080 --> 02:03:37,798
Leave everything to me

2075
02:03:44,280 --> 02:03:46,316
l've got a message for
you from Miss Courtney

2076
02:03:46,440 --> 02:03:48,317
- Oh yes - Push off

2077
02:03:50,520 --> 02:03:51,430
What?

2078
02:03:51,880 --> 02:03:52,949
We know all about your little games

2079
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:55,230
So l'd advise you to get lost
quick, before l throw you out

2080
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:58,670
- You and whose army?
- Me and this army

2081
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:15,758
Yeah, well... perhaps
l had better be going

2082
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:22,911
All right Miss Courtney, he's gone

2083
02:04:23,400 --> 02:04:28,269
Oh thank you Mr. Brown
