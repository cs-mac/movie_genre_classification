Oh! That's my fault.

244
00:18:34,137 --> 00:18:36,936
I didn't have a chance to read the school packages...

245
00:18:36,937 --> 00:18:39,104

00:20:47,718 --> 00:20:48,587
Yes.

294
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:49,898
But my mom says...

295
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:51,350
If you eat standing up...

296
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:53,183
gives you gas.

297
00:20:54,397 --> 00:20:55,324
You're funny.

298
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:35,150
Come to fix hot water.

299
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:36,032

In the neck with a toothpaste cap?

304
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:24,963
Hot water fine.

305
00:22:25,596 --> 00:22:26,437
Flip switch.

306
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:27,764
Wait half hour.

307
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:29,029
Take shower.

308
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:30,781
Flip switch off.

309
00:22:31,582 --> 00:22:32,326
Why don't you just leave it on?

310
00:22:34,279 --> 00:22:35,537
You leave on in America?

311
00:22:35,538 --> 00:22:36,845
Don't have switch in America.

312
00:22:37,504 --> 00:22:38,529
Get switch.

00:22:46,463 --> 00:22:47,532
Interesting pole.

317
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:49,993

318
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:51,490
That's my mom.

319
00:22:51,857 --> 00:22:53,297
And the door handle's messed up.

320
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:55,047
Are you ready for school?

321
00:22:55,813 --> 00:22:56,813

00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:28,605
That's right!

337
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,687
Make it happen!

338
00:23:30,787 --> 00:23:31,746
I'm sorry what was that!
- Nothing.

339
00:23:31,747 --> 00:23:32,991
Okay that's what I thought.

340
00:23:32,992 --> 00:23:33,992
Nothing!

341
00:23:36,204 --> 00:23:36,976
Thank you!

342
00:25:21,126 --> 00:25:22,812
Okay. That's not play.

343
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:24,974
You're rushing it.

344
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,082
You must play the pauses.

345
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,494
You know how important this is for your family?

346
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,349
What it will mean for your life?

347
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,162
We have to work with regent.

348
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:36,753
I'm calling your father.

349
00:25:41,922 --> 00:25:42,922
Continue.

350
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:49,630
<i> What is your name? </i>

351
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:54,619
How's that sound?

352
00:25:55,457 --> 00:25:56,895
Almost like the chinese.

353
00:25:57,217 --> 00:25:58,325
Yeah! I'm fluent.

354
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:00,337
And I don't know what
that guy was talking about?

355
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:01,718
I thought you sounded great!

356
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,194
Thank you.

357
00:26:11,201 --> 00:26:14,083
So are you practising for anything?

358
00:26:14,084 --> 00:26:15,213
Like a show.

359
00:26:16,198 --> 00:26:16,961
Yes!

360
00:26:17,288 --> 00:26:18,982
I have an audition next month.

361
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:20,917
For the Beijing Academy of Music.

362
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:23,636
Beijing Academy of Music.

363
00:26:24,694 --> 00:26:25,536
Sounds important.

364
00:26:26,214 --> 00:26:27,019
You know!

365
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,851
Their initials spell: BAM!

366
00:26:35,098 --> 00:26:36,098
What?

367
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:39,916
Oh... gotta go.

368
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:02,224
Hey!

369
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:03,928
Can I touch you here?

370
00:27:10,805 --> 00:27:11,847
Gonna do something?

371
00:27:14,921 --> 00:27:16,592
Just stay away from us!

372
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:19,869
All of us.

373
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:41,028
Dre!

374
00:27:44,184 --> 00:27:45,841
Dre? Are you sleeping?

375
00:28:15,874 --> 00:28:17,233
Hey! Can you sign this?

376
00:28:17,661 --> 00:28:19,020
Forbidden City!

377
00:28:20,326 --> 00:28:23,755
I think it's funny to give my permission to go
to the Forbidden City.

378
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,036
Cool! In Beijing.

379
00:28:26,749 --> 00:28:27,898
Not funny mom.

380
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,014
Oh, cut it out grumpy.

381
00:28:29,984 --> 00:28:30,504
I'm serious Dre...

382
00:28:30,505 --> 00:28:32,884
this ice cream I don't know what they do to it.

383
00:28:32,885 --> 00:28:35,022
But it's more favouristic.

384
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:35,679
What?

385
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Mom.

386
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,344
This is you...

387
00:28:37,648 --> 00:28:39,807
Oh goodness this ice cream here is so good...

388
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,395
and everything in China is just so much...

389
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:42,578
better than everything else...

390
00:28:42,977 --> 00:28:43,564
Ouch! Mom!

391
00:28:43,565 --> 00:28:44,067
C'mon!

392
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:45,885
First of all, I don't sound like that.

393
00:28:45,886 --> 00:28:47,824
I don't move all like that.

394
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:50,738
I'm sure this ice cream is really good.

395
00:28:51,718 --> 00:28:52,487
Mom, mom c'mon.

396
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:53,981
Dre.

397
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:54,961
Wait!

398
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:57,028
Boy you won't a ... running from me.

399
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:00,769
Wow...

400
00:29:01,961 --> 00:29:02,943
Kungfu.

401
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:46,919
<i> What did you all learn? </i>

402
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,908
<i> Never Fail, </i>

403
00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:49,169
<i> Never Falter, </i>

404
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,170
<i> Never Backdown! </i>

405
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,340
<i> Salute! </i>

406
00:30:07,993 --> 00:30:08,613
Mom! C'mon let's go.

407
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:09,142
What!

408
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,795
Dre, we just got here.
- C'mon mom!

409
00:30:12,849 --> 00:30:14,281
Dre! What's going on?

410
00:30:15,273 --> 00:30:15,942
Nothing!

411
00:30:16,571 --> 00:30:17,525
Dre, what happened?

412
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:19,144
Nothing happened.

413
00:30:19,894 --> 00:30:21,333
What is it? You don't want to
take that class?

414
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,147
Whatever Dre. What happened?

415
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:25,654
We moved to China!

416
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,302
That's what happened!

417
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:42,800
Okay Stop!

418
00:30:46,581 --> 00:30:47,644
Don't be like that Dre.

419
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:51,227
What do you want me to do?

420
00:30:52,303 --> 00:30:53,324
We've been here less than a week...

421
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:54,816
And I feel...
- I feel like it's a year!

422
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:57,313
I hate it here!

423
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:04,648
Dre, please let me help you.

424
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:10,133
I can't hope to if you don't
tell me what's wrong.

425
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:11,840
Please.
- You don't care what's wrong!

426
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:13,417
All you care is...

427
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:14,531
how happy I am...

428
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:16,249
and how great the ice cream is!

429
00:31:17,618 --> 00:31:18,536
Well, I'm not happy!

430
00:31:19,357 --> 00:31:20,774
I hate it HERE!

431
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:31,681
I want to go HOME!

432
00:31:33,556 --> 00:31:34,740
Dre, we can't go home...

433
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:36,141
Okay!

434
00:31:36,625 --> 00:31:38,916
There is nothing left for us in Detroit.

435
00:31:39,984 --> 00:31:41,097
This is what we got!

436
00:31:44,341 --> 00:31:45,537
This IS home.

437
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:49,934
Okay...

438
00:32:10,176 --> 00:32:11,999
Gather round here!

439
00:32:12,736 --> 00:32:13,981
Welcome to one of the most...

440
00:32:13,982 --> 00:32:16,543
popular landmarks in all over China.

441
00:32:16,817 --> 00:32:18,422
It's visited by millions of people...

442
00:32:18,423 --> 00:32:19,423
every year.

443
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:21,220
The Forbidden City!

444
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:01,356
... for good luck.

445
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:21,028
I wish someone would just...
- yeah.

446
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:22,701
Me too.

447
00:33:24,634 --> 00:33:25,861
Just tell someone.

448
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:27,274
Yeah! I got it.

449
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,394
Thanks a lot.

450
00:33:38,918 --> 00:33:41,875
The floors of the palace was reinforced with bricks.

451
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:43,372
15 layers deep...

452
00:33:43,842 --> 00:33:45,988
To prevent anyone from climbing in.

453
00:33:50,769 --> 00:33:51,435
Mr. Parker.

454
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:52,162
Oh yes...

455
00:33:52,549 --> 00:33:53,549
Is everything okay?

456
00:33:55,861 --> 00:33:57,878
Er... yes, Yes.
Thank you.

457
00:34:35,161 --> 00:34:36,161
<i> Chung: Let's go. </i>

458
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,106
<i> Man:  Go away, go away...</i>

459
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:20,236
<i> Man: Go away, quickly go away.
- We were just playing.</i>

460
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:57,782
<i> Chung: Who done it!</i>

461
00:36:04,021 --> 00:36:05,021
<i> Halt! </i>

462
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,815
<i> Over here. </i>

463
00:36:15,281 --> 00:36:15,946
<i> Chung: Halt! </i>

464
00:36:16,837 --> 00:36:17,636
<i> Chung: Halt! </i>

465
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:25,318
<i> Man: Hey! That's my roof!</i>

466
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:31,583
<i> Get him! </i>

467
00:36:33,313 --> 00:36:34,034
<i> Halt! right there! </i>

468
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:40,691
<i> Don't let him run away!</i>

469
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:48,957
<i> He's lock the door!</i>

470
00:36:49,733 --> 00:36:50,761
<i> Chung: Hurry! Open the door! </i>

471
00:36:51,145 --> 00:36:51,943
<i> He's (Dre) beyond the door. </i>

472
00:37:02,844 --> 00:37:03,844
<i> Halt!</i>

473
00:37:03,966 --> 00:37:04,690
<i> Stop right there!</i>

474
00:37:36,616 --> 00:37:37,555
<i> Still wanna run!</i>

475
00:37:39,765 --> 00:37:40,427
<i> Now you're done!</i>

476
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:42,251
You're fast.

477
00:37:44,650 --> 00:37:45,729
Not fast enough.

478
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:04,282
<i> That's enough Chung. </i>

479
00:38:04,937 --> 00:38:06,033
<i> Chung: Don't you guys wanna
use what you learned? </i>

480
00:38:06,176 --> 00:38:07,271
<i> I'm serious! That's enough beating! </i>

481
00:38:10,201 --> 00:38:11,041
<i> Chung: Don't stop me! </i>

482
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:23,878
<i> Go home. </i>

483
00:38:31,382 --> 00:38:32,161
<i> C'mon! </i>

484
00:40:11,469 --> 00:40:12,603
<i> Go home. </i>

485
00:40:20,589 --> 00:40:21,740
C'mon.

486
00:40:35,509 --> 00:40:37,152
What's up with the light bulb Mr. Han?

487
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,022
I thought you were just the
maintenance man.

488
00:41:17,021 --> 00:41:18,017
You think only with your eyes.

489
00:41:18,718 --> 00:41:20,048
So you are easy to fool.

490
00:41:23,409 --> 00:41:24,253
It doesn't hurt.

491
00:41:26,347 --> 00:41:28,695
Ancient chinese healing.

492
00:41:29,438 --> 00:41:29,990
How do you do that out there?

493
00:41:29,991 --> 00:41:31,408
You like... didn't even punch them.

494
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:33,560
They... beat each other up.

495
00:41:34,005 --> 00:41:35,148
When beating angry blind men,

496
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:37,380
Best to just...

497
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,866
stay outta the way.

498
00:41:41,634 --> 00:41:42,864
So... where did you learn kungfu?

499
00:41:43,694 --> 00:41:44,446
From father.

500
00:41:45,382 --> 00:41:46,433
Have you ever taught anybody?

501
00:41:48,429 --> 00:41:49,429
No.

502
00:41:51,399 --> 00:41:52,171
Would you?

503
00:41:53,794 --> 00:41:54,486
Depends.

504
00:41:55,014 --> 00:41:55,697
On what?

505
00:41:56,378 --> 00:41:57,378
Reason.

506
00:41:58,661 --> 00:42:00,082
What about to kick somebodies ass?

507
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:05,803
Best fights... are the ones we avoid.

508
00:42:06,476 --> 00:42:08,477
How about avoid getting my ass kicked?

509
00:42:08,807 --> 00:42:09,655
Stop saying ass.

510
00:42:09,656 --> 00:42:10,656
Sorry.

511
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:17,336
Kungfu...

512
00:42:17,685 --> 00:42:19,159
if for knowledge... defense.

513
00:42:19,796 --> 00:42:20,778
Not to make war.

514
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:22,147
To create peace.

515
00:42:22,529 --> 00:42:24,045
That's definitely not what they are taught.

516
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,318
Not such things as bad students.

517
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:28,714
Only bad teacher.

518
00:42:29,002 --> 00:42:30,056
Erm... That's great!

519
00:42:30,554 --> 00:42:31,150
I guess we just...

520
00:42:31,151 --> 00:42:33,796
stroll into their school and talk to their teacher.

521
00:42:34,439 --> 00:42:35,024
Good idea.

522
00:42:35,025 --> 00:42:35,822
No!

523
00:42:35,823 --> 00:42:37,025
Bad idea!

524
00:42:37,232 --> 00:42:39,031
If I go in there! I'll get my ass kicked.

525
00:42:41,981 --> 00:42:42,856
I'll get beat up.

526
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:44,683
You got beat up anyway.

527
00:42:50,430 --> 00:42:51,452
would you go with me?

528
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:55,005
No! Sorry.

529
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:57,788
but you said it was a good idea.

530
00:42:57,789 --> 00:42:59,263
For you! Bad idea for me.

531
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,536
C'mon it's not like you are busy or anything.

532
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:01,893
And... 

533
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:04,316
I don't even speak chinese.

534
00:43:04,271 --> 00:43:04,996
Very sorry.

535
00:43:11,453 --> 00:43:12,334
Right.

536
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,384
Alright whatever.

537
00:43:30,765 --> 00:43:31,765
<i> Hey! </i>

538
00:44:10,712 --> 00:44:11,133
<i> What's wrong? </i>

539
00:44:12,537 --> 00:44:13,236
<i> Why didn't you finish him? </i>

540
00:44:15,266 --> 00:44:16,390
<i> DO IT! </i>

541
00:44:20,754 --> 00:44:22,000
Okay Mr. Han. Let's get outta here.

542
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:23,001
<i> Return to position! </i>

543
00:44:27,555 --> 00:44:30,505
<i> Never show mercy even if the opponent is down. </i>

544
00:44:31,185 --> 00:44:32,061
<i> Don't hesitate. </i>

545
00:44:32,709 --> 00:44:34,021
<i> Keep attacking.</i>

546
00:44:34,816 --> 00:44:36,630
<i> Until you obliterate the opponent. </i>

547
00:44:42,826 --> 00:44:43,591
<i> What are you looking at?</i>

548
00:44:44,769 --> 00:44:46,630
<i> Chung: It's that man that beat me.</i>

549
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,359
<i> We'll here for an apology. </i>

550
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:05,619
<i> Let him fight his own battles.</i>

551
00:45:08,226 --> 00:45:09,554
<i> If it was a even fight.</i>

552
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:11,265
<i> But he was outnumbered.</i>

553
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:12,469
<i> It was unfair.</i>

554
00:45:14,134 --> 00:45:15,134
<i> I understand.</i>

555
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:16,794
<i> Prepare for a duel! </i>

556
00:45:21,202 --> 00:45:21,405
Woah... 

557
00:45:21,406 --> 00:45:24,301
Mr. Han did he want us to fight?

558
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:27,751
<i> We're not here for a fight. </i>

559
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:34,101
<i> You beat up my student. </i>

560
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:36,602
<i> You ask for a duel. </i>

561
00:45:36,983 --> 00:45:37,835
<i> Now you wanna walk away? </i>

562
00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:39,380
<i> Not without a fight. </i>

563
00:45:41,802 --> 00:45:42,870
<i> Master Li. </i>

564
00:45:47,190 --> 00:45:48,537
<i> Why don't you fight in his (Dre) place. </i>

565
00:45:50,182 --> 00:45:53,997
<i> One of you have to fight. </i>

566
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:00,332
<i> Then we fight in the tournament. </i>

567
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,853
<i> Fine. </i>

568
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:15,417
<i> I accept. </i>

569
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:20,417
<i> From now til the tournament. </i>

570
00:46:20,418 --> 00:46:22,712
<i> Leave my student (Dre) alone. </i>

571
00:46:24,561 --> 00:46:25,565
<i> Listen UP! </i>

572
00:46:29,114 --> 00:46:33,145
<i> Until the tournament.
Do not harass Mr. Han's student (Dre). </i>

573
00:46:33,954 --> 00:46:34,836
<i> UNDERSTAND! </i>

574
00:46:35,284 --> 00:46:36,180
<i> UNDERSTOOD! </i>

575
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:38,854
<i> Hey! </i>

576
00:46:42,384 --> 00:46:44,607
<i> If the boy fails to appear, </i>

577
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:47,595
<i> then you are a dishonoured! </i>

578
00:47:00,373 --> 00:47:01,092
So!

579
00:47:01,512 --> 00:47:02,592
That go pretty much you planned it?

580
00:47:04,347 --> 00:47:05,488
There's good news and bad news.

581
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:07,971
Good news is. They promised
to leave you alone.

582
00:47:09,445 --> 00:47:10,084
Really?

583
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:11,648
While you prepare.

584
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:14,336
Prepare for what?

585
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,907
Tournament.

586
00:47:17,381 --> 00:47:19,360
You'll fight them all, one to one.

587
00:47:20,794 --> 00:47:21,578
Huh?

588
00:47:24,525 --> 00:47:25,136
So the bad news is,

589
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:27,330
Now they get to beat me up in public!

590
00:47:27,332 --> 00:47:28,145
Yes.

591
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:29,133
Great!

592
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:29,740
Thanks!

593
00:47:29,741 --> 00:47:30,741
Thanks a lot!

594
00:47:31,032 --> 00:47:31,735
They're gonna kill me.

595
00:47:31,736 --> 00:47:32,736
You saw they're kungfu.

596
00:47:33,678 --> 00:47:34,891
That's not kungfu!

597
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:37,113
That does not represent China!

598
00:47:37,126 --> 00:47:38,158
Well, that bad man teaching,

599
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,239
very bad things hurt!

600
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:40,490
A lot!

601
00:47:44,023 --> 00:47:44,919
More good news

602
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:47,390
I will teach you real kungfu.

603
00:47:51,292 --> 00:47:52,292
Yes!

604
00:48:01,998 --> 00:48:02,998
See you later mom!

605
00:48:02,999 --> 00:48:05,831
Hey wait! This is early for you for a Saturday.

606
00:48:06,423 --> 00:48:07,606
Mr. Han is teaching me kungfu.

607
00:48:07,921 --> 00:48:08,892
The maintenance man?

608
00:48:09,332 --> 00:48:10,795
It's China mom! Everybody knows kungfu.

609
00:48:12,198 --> 00:48:13,741
Dre, you know how I feel about you fighting.

610
00:48:13,742 --> 00:48:14,958
Kungfu is not about fighting mom,

611
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:17,285
It's about making peace with your enemy.

612
00:48:16,983 --> 00:48:17,787
Be careful Dre!

613
00:48:18,146 --> 00:48:19,146
Okay!

614
00:48:57,791 --> 00:48:58,633
Mr. Han!

615
00:49:20,059 --> 00:49:20,981
Mr Han!...

616
00:49:21,463 --> 00:49:22,230
Back here!

617
00:49:25,138 --> 00:49:26,852
You know you have a car in your living room.
Mr Han.

618
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:31,651
Okay.

619
00:49:31,621 --> 00:49:32,734
I was thinking about it yesterday.

620
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,137
I know I was kindna freaking out
about the tournament.

621
00:49:35,507 --> 00:49:36,508
But I realised something last night.

622
00:49:38,019 --> 00:49:39,771
I'm an athlete!

623
00:49:40,656 --> 00:49:41,855
My number one asset!

624
00:49:42,139 --> 00:49:43,139
Is I'm fast okay.

625
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:44,523
I'm quick.

626
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:45,057
Quick...

627
00:49:45,332 --> 00:49:46,332
Speed...

628
00:49:46,218 --> 00:49:47,026
Catch me...

629
00:49:48,732 --> 00:49:49,678
I'm quick... yeah.

630
00:49:50,275 --> 00:49:51,978
I used to take gymnastics at P.A.L!

631
00:49:52,146 --> 00:49:54,053
That's the Police Athleteic League! So
check it right...

632
00:49:55,452 --> 00:49:56,452
Boom! You see that!

633
00:49:57,038 --> 00:49:57,794
Boom. You see that!

634
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:00,052
Yeah!

635
00:50:00,905 --> 00:50:03,158
My uncle Raymi used to date
this brazilian girl.

636
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:04,495
And he learnt Jujitsu...

637
00:50:04,496 --> 00:50:05,715
and he taught some of it to me.

638
00:50:05,814 --> 00:50:07,758
Its like locks and holds and stuff...
Okay.

639
00:50:08,123 --> 00:50:09,123
Attack me.

640
00:50:14,919 --> 00:50:15,630
See that?

641
00:50:15,631 --> 00:50:16,631
Feel that?

642
00:50:16,995 --> 00:50:17,709
I could break it.

643
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:18,952
I'm choosing not to.

644
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,112
It's a pressure lock.

645
00:50:20,113 --> 00:50:21,113
Dangerous.

646
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,934
Oh he also taught me Caporeira.

647
00:50:24,191 --> 00:50:24,994
Can't touch me.

648
00:50:24,995 --> 00:50:25,995
Can't...

649
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:32,363
That antique?

650
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:35,241
Pickup your jacket.

651
00:50:36,852 --> 00:50:37,852
Oh...

652
00:50:39,374 --> 00:50:40,264
So basically Mr. Han...

653
00:50:40,265 --> 00:50:41,488
I'm trying to say is.

654
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:43,463
I've got a good foundation here.

655
00:50:43,464 --> 00:50:45,560
Know... like I say just I'm just...

656
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,363
Might not be as hard as you
teach other people you know.

657
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:50,057
Hang it up.

658
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:51,810
Okay.

659
00:50:52,038 --> 00:50:53,079
Happy now?

660
00:50:54,383 --> 00:50:55,642
Take it down.

661
00:50:58,885 --> 00:50:59,533
But I just...

662
00:50:59,534 --> 00:51:00,869
Take it down.

663
00:51:04,911 --> 00:51:05,911
Put it on.

664
00:51:11,874 --> 00:51:12,691
Take it off.

665
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:14,865
I'd already did all these.
- TAKE IT off.

666
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:17,748
Can you tell me why I'm doing this.
Take it OFF.

667
00:51:22,355 --> 00:51:23,221
Hang it up.

668
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:28,729
Take it down.

669
00:51:29,995 --> 00:51:31,490
Put it on the ground.

670
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:34,715
Pick it up.

671
00:51:37,341 --> 00:51:38,153
Hang up.

672
00:51:39,824 --> 00:51:40,490
Take it down.

673
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,011
Put it on!

674
00:51:46,185 --> 00:51:47,020
Take it off.

675
00:51:49,945 --> 00:51:50,711
Put on the ground.

676
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:52,829
Pick it up.

677
00:51:55,039 --> 00:51:56,038
Hang it up.

678
00:51:57,634 --> 00:51:58,524
Take it down.

679
00:52:00,311 --> 00:52:00,965
Put it on.

680
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:03,877
Take it off.

681
00:52:05,619 --> 00:52:06,928
Put it on.

682
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,232
Mr. Han.

683
00:52:18,664 --> 00:52:20,227
Why do you have a car in your living room?

684
00:52:20,832 --> 00:52:21,540
No street parking.

685
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:31,739
Hey!

686
00:52:33,418 --> 00:52:34,176
So how did it go?

687
00:52:35,067 --> 00:52:35,999
What'd you learn?

688
00:52:36,843 --> 00:52:37,850
Nothing.

689
00:53:12,809 --> 00:53:15,364
Uniform on uniform day.

690
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:16,950
You're fighting the tournament.

691
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,785
Yeah.

692
00:53:18,786 --> 00:53:19,091
How did you hear?

693
00:53:20,088 --> 00:53:20,931
Everybody knows.

694
00:53:25,129 --> 00:53:26,892
I hope you have a good teacher.

695
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,722
Yeah... me too.

696
00:53:31,046 --> 00:53:31,985
He's a maintenance man.

697
00:53:33,399 --> 00:53:34,430
Can I ask you a question?

698
00:53:34,431 --> 00:53:35,431
Yes.

699
00:53:35,682 --> 00:53:37,298
Well, now that you're practising and,

700
00:53:38,235 --> 00:53:39,553

701
00:53:39,554 --> 00:53:40,167

00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:41,168
<i> Meiying we'll wait for you over there. </i>

703
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:42,010
But.

704

<i> We're going.

00:53:56,414 --> 00:53:57,725

00:53:59,252 --> 00:54:00,361

712
00:54:01,153 --> 00:54:02,321
Oh, oh so.

Mr. Han!

729
00:54:49,662 --> 00:54:50,506
May I come in?

730
00:54:50,507 --> 00:54:51,009
You may come in.

731
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:58,361
Where's your jacket?

732
00:55:01,253 --> 00:55:02,600
I was warming up without it.

733
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:03,601
Go get it.

734
00:55:04,394 --> 00:55:05,838
You want me to go all the way back just to get it?

735
00:55:06,484 --> 00:55:08,118
Yes, all the way back where you hide it.

736
00:55:35,253 --> 00:55:36,253
It's not right.

737
00:55:36,203 --> 00:55:37,203
What?

738
00:55:37,204 --> 00:55:38,204
I'm doing it.

739
00:55:41,521 --> 00:55:42,521
No.

740
00:55:43,096 --> 00:55:44,148
Something's missing.

741
00:55:44,149 --> 00:55:45,398
Nothing's missing.

742
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:52,484
Ah...!

743
00:55:54,288 --> 00:55:55,091
You forgot.

744
00:55:55,106 --> 00:55:56,106
This.

745
00:55:57,905 --> 00:55:58,908
Attitude.

746
00:56:01,214 --> 00:56:02,172
Check it off.

747
00:56:06,688 --> 00:56:07,688
Attitude.

748
00:56:08,523 --> 00:56:10,317
Yes! That's it.

749
00:56:11,362 --> 00:56:12,626
Yes, Mr. Han I get it.

750
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:13,153
I'm sorry.

751
00:56:12,627 --> 00:56:14,659
I shouldn't treat my mom like that.

752
00:56:15,797 --> 00:56:16,459
You were right.

753
00:56:21,486 --> 00:56:22,146
Put on the ground.

754
00:56:23,322 --> 00:56:24,256
Hello!

755
00:56:25,441 --> 00:56:26,429
Oh... Hey mom!

756
00:56:27,244 --> 00:56:28,688
Amm... did you get the tickets?

757
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:31,794
Yes! I got the tickets.

758
00:56:31,970 --> 00:56:35,298
And... I got an extra one for
Mr. Han!

759
00:56:36,304 --> 00:56:37,223
But I didn't say...

760
00:56:37,224 --> 00:56:38,589
Dre, stop it!

761
00:56:39,126 --> 00:56:41,667
Mr. Han would you like to go
with us to the Shi Sze Festival?

762
00:56:42,735 --> 00:56:43,789
No thank you.

763
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:44,926
Too many people.

764
00:56:46,235 --> 00:56:47,980
Yeah mom way too many people.

765
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:49,283
But I already bought the tickets.

766
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:52,426
I don't go
- Mr. Han I won't take a no for an answer!

767
00:56:53,266 --> 00:56:55,041
You have fun, you need to get
out of the house okay!

768
00:56:55,595 --> 00:56:56,415
Here's your clothes Dre.

769
00:56:56,768 --> 00:56:57,851
C'mon hurry up and change.

770
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:04,027
Dre?

771
00:57:05,518 --> 00:57:06,591
PICK UP YOUR JACKET!

772
00:57:19,748 --> 00:57:22,088
You were right Mr. Han. There
are a lot of people here.

773
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:24,281
Chinese Valentine's Day.

774
00:57:35,531 --> 00:57:37,290
This is beautiful.

775
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:39,921
Yeah mom.

776
00:57:39,922 --> 00:57:40,922
Yeah?

777
00:57:40,597 --> 00:57:41,752
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

778
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:43,011
And then I'm going to the bathroom.

779
00:57:43,012 --> 00:57:44,070
Be back.

780
00:57:44,071 --> 00:57:45,561
Right here. In twenty minutes.

781
00:57:45,966 --> 00:57:46,966
Okay.

782
00:57:46,912 --> 00:57:47,912
Okay. I love you.

783
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:48,913
Love you too. Be careful.

784
00:57:48,914 --> 00:57:49,914
Twenty minutes!

785
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,715
Twenty!
- Okay.

786
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,217
So what is the origins of this festival again?

787
00:57:55,218 --> 00:57:57,325
I know everything you do here have a meaning.

788
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:05,597
'Shadow Theatre'

789
00:58:15,209 --> 00:58:16,209
Hi.

790
00:58:24,883 --> 00:58:25,891
<i> Shadow master: You two come over and help. </i>

791
00:58:40,842 --> 00:58:41,842
Hi...

792
00:58:42,055 --> 00:58:43,055
Hey...

793
00:58:43,781 --> 00:58:45,330
Well, I got this and this

794
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:46,491
for you.

795
00:58:46,492 --> 00:58:47,430
I got one of this and...

796
00:58:47,478 --> 00:58:49,414
cos she have this really cool violin stuff.

797
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:50,415
And...

798
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:52,579
I thought maybe you could play along

799
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,367
and...

800
00:58:53,368 --> 00:58:54,841
Its not like Bach and them but...

801
00:58:55,787 --> 00:58:57,430
So I thought maybe you like it.
And...

802
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:09,251
<i> Thank you. </i>

803
00:59:23,054 --> 00:59:23,994
So amm...

804
00:59:24,722 --> 00:59:25,722
Do you have any kids?

805
00:59:26,781 --> 00:59:27,781
No.

806
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:31,208
So how's Dre doing?

807
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,776
Aaa...

808
00:59:33,092 --> 00:59:35,034
Xiao (Chinese:Young/ little) Dre making a progress.

809
00:59:35,335 --> 00:59:36,299
Xiao Dre?

810
00:59:36,903 --> 00:59:38,389
Yeah Aa... Chinese for little.

811
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:39,833
Oh!

812
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:41,931
So Amm...

813
00:59:41,932 --> 00:59:45,004
How many students do you have?

814
00:59:45,235 --> 00:59:46,195
Including xiao Dre?

815
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:47,196
Yeah.

816
00:59:48,404 --> 00:59:49,404
One.

817
00:59:56,564 --> 00:59:58,011
So hmm... What's this show about?

818
00:59:59,521 --> 01:00:00,636
Aa...

819
01:00:00,662 --> 01:00:02,776
It's the story of the Goddess...

820
01:00:03,505 --> 01:00:04,867
And the boy she loves...

821
01:00:06,504 --> 01:00:07,794
I love this story.

822
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:14,025
Her mother does not approve of him.

823
01:00:14,026 --> 01:00:17,295
So, she cast a wide river in the sky.

824
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,662
To separate them forever.

825
01:00:20,663 --> 01:00:22,887
But, once a year.

826
01:00:22,779 --> 01:00:25,135
All the birds in the sky...

827
01:00:26,804 --> 01:00:28,073
feel sad for them.

828
01:00:28,074 --> 01:00:30,238
And they form a bridge.

829
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:35,017
So the two of them,

830
01:00:35,018 --> 01:00:39,824
maybe together for a single night.

831
01:00:46,593 --> 01:00:47,363
I'll be there at the audition.

832
01:00:47,364 --> 01:00:48,758
If you come to my tournament.

833
01:00:50,406 --> 01:00:51,826
Okay. I'll be there.

834
01:00:52,372 --> 01:00:53,551
Pinky swear?

835
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,210
See. You wrap your hands like this.

836
01:00:57,955 --> 01:00:58,741
I swear...

837
01:00:58,742 --> 01:01:00,391
I'll be there at your audition.

838
01:01:00,685 --> 01:01:02,365
No matter what happens.

839
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:03,544
And I promise,

840
01:01:03,811 --> 01:01:05,939
to cheer bigger than anyone else...

841
01:01:06,025 --> 01:01:06,741
when you win.

842
01:01:44,591 --> 01:01:45,565
Wha UP! Mr. Han!

843
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:48,784
Did I say come in?

844
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,538
I think you did I mean...

845
01:01:57,735 --> 01:01:59,204
Mr. Han Can I please come in?

846
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:00,715
Yes.

847
01:02:03,643 --> 01:02:04,578
So what are we doing today?

848
01:02:04,756 --> 01:02:05,756
Same!

849
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:54,142
Woah Mr. Han!

850
01:02:54,678 --> 01:02:55,107
I told you!

851
01:02:55,108 --> 01:02:56,742
I get it! Okay!

852
01:02:57,224 --> 01:02:59,105
Be respectful!
I got it!

853
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,105
I put on my jacket a thousand times!

854
01:03:01,355 --> 01:03:03,410
I took it off a thousand TIMES!

855
01:03:03,527 --> 01:03:04,200
Okay!

856
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:05,201
This is stupid!

857
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:06,202
I'm done!

858
01:03:07,059 --> 01:03:08,388
They can beat me up if they want to!

859
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:11,925
And do you know why you only have one student?

860
01:03:12,604 --> 01:03:13,698
Cos you don't know kungfu!

861
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,030
Xiao Dre!

862
01:03:16,443 --> 01:03:17,443
What!

863
01:03:23,488 --> 01:03:24,537
Come here!

864
01:03:33,252 --> 01:03:33,589
Jacket on.

865
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:34,486
Mr. Han I'd already...

866
01:03:34,487 --> 01:03:35,437
JACKET ON!

867
01:03:45,847 --> 01:03:47,112
Jacket on.

868
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:47,833
I don't have a jacket ...

869
01:03:47,834 --> 01:03:48,834
JACKET ON!

870
01:03:56,384 --> 01:03:57,743
Be strong.

871
01:03:59,256 --> 01:04:00,386
Jacket on.

872
01:04:02,097 --> 01:04:03,256
Firm.

873
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:05,756
Jacket off.

874
01:04:08,571 --> 01:04:09,427
Remember.

875
01:04:10,319 --> 01:04:11,662
Always strong.

876
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:14,169
Jacket off.

877
01:04:18,970 --> 01:04:19,970
Strong!

878
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:22,275
Left back!

879
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:23,650
Right feet back!

880
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,651
Left feet back!

881
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:25,652
Hang up your jacket!

882
01:04:27,591 --> 01:04:28,258
Wow...!

883
01:04:28,259 --> 01:04:29,025
Focus!
- Okay!

884
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,866
Always concentrate.

885
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:31,867
Left back!

886
01:04:32,523 --> 01:04:33,523
Right foot back!

887
01:04:33,531 --> 01:04:34,531
Pick up your jacket!

888
01:04:35,644 --> 01:04:36,644
Stay!

889
01:04:39,362 --> 01:04:40,362
Pick up your jacket.

890
01:04:41,848 --> 01:04:42,848
Ouch!

891
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:46,359
Strong.

892
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:48,019
Hang it up.

893
01:04:48,955 --> 01:04:49,955
Hang it up!

894
01:04:50,981 --> 01:04:51,981
Hang up!

895
01:04:52,099 --> 01:04:53,099
Attitude!

896
01:04:54,681 --> 01:04:55,681
Strike!

897
01:04:56,759 --> 01:04:57,759
Hang up! And Attitude!

898
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,020
Harder!

899
01:05:00,386 --> 01:05:01,386
HARDER!

900
01:05:04,057 --> 01:05:05,057
Good.

901
01:05:06,167 --> 01:05:07,035
But no face.

902
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:09,626
<i> AGAIN!</i>

903
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:32,477
Kungfu lives.

904
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:33,934
Everything we do. Xiao Dre!

905
01:05:35,671 --> 01:05:36,211
It lives in...

906
01:05:36,212 --> 01:05:37,792
how we put on a jacket.

907
01:05:37,793 --> 01:05:38,883
How we take off the jacket.

908
01:05:41,014 --> 01:05:42,948
It lives in how we treat people.

909
01:05:46,026 --> 01:05:47,033
Everything...

910
01:05:47,892 --> 01:05:49,247
is kungfu.

911
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:33,503
So why didn't we take the Ceroco?

912
01:06:34,651 --> 01:06:36,000
I don't drive the Ceroco.

913
01:06:38,443 --> 01:06:39,511
Do you have a licence?

914
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:42,388
Yes

915
01:06:43,283 --> 01:06:44,283
So you have a licence...

916
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,070
and a car.

917
01:06:46,694 --> 01:06:47,694
And we're on a train.

918
01:06:49,855 --> 01:06:51,077
Please be quiet.

919
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:52,835
I'm just saying.

920
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:54,586
Seems like we could save a lot of money.

921
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:56,407
Don't you think?

922
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,413
You always ask this many questions?

923
01:07:01,753 --> 01:07:02,954
It's alright.

924
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:05,913
So what are we learning today?

925
01:07:09,215 --> 01:07:10,215
Chi.

926
01:07:11,832 --> 01:07:14,208
Internal energy.

927
01:07:14,935 --> 01:07:16,952
'The essense of life'.

928
01:07:18,028 --> 01:07:19,513
It moves inside of us.

929
01:07:19,514 --> 01:07:21,617
Flows through our bodies'.

930
01:07:21,712 --> 01:07:23,515
Gives us power from within.

931
01:07:29,102 --> 01:07:30,296
I get it.

932
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,428
Like 'The Force' in Star Wars.

933
01:07:33,535 --> 01:07:34,827
You're Yoda and I'm like...

934
01:07:35,759 --> 01:07:36,959
I'm like a 'Jedi'.

935
01:07:44,899 --> 01:07:45,980
<i> Hey! Trishaw! </i>

936
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:07,525
<i> Driver: Thank you! </i>

937
01:08:09,224 --> 01:08:10,582
Is this where you learned kungfu?

938
01:08:11,355 --> 01:08:12,355
Yes.

939
01:08:14,335 --> 01:08:16,336
Everything good about me was born here.

940
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:18,114
Xiao Dre,

941
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:21,011
you can leave your backpack
and skateboard here.

942
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:22,263
So where we're going?

943
01:08:22,540 --> 01:08:24,569
We journey to the top of the mountain.

944
01:08:25,195 --> 01:08:26,328
Drink from the Dragon Well.

945
01:08:29,804 --> 01:08:30,672
'Dragon Well'.

946
01:08:31,259 --> 01:08:33,529
It's probably closer than it is,

947
01:08:33,530 --> 01:08:35,064
looking at it.

948
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:37,451
Right?

949
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:06,451
Are we there yet?

950
01:09:07,023 --> 01:09:08,023
Soon.

951
01:09:09,671 --> 01:09:10,671
Oh...

952
01:09:11,331 --> 01:09:12,784
How do you say water in Chinese?

953
01:09:13,058 --> 01:09:14,058
<i> Shui (water). </i>

954
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:16,151
I need some shui.

955
01:09:17,694 --> 01:09:18,661
I'm really...

956
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,488
thirsty.

957
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:27,083
I'm thirsty Mr. Han.

958
01:09:27,219 --> 01:09:28,284
Water on top of mountain.

959
01:11:41,557 --> 01:11:42,557
Xiao Dre.

960
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:54,656
The journey is complete.

961
01:11:57,559 --> 01:11:58,655
Is this the 'Dragon Well' ?

962
01:12:00,628 --> 01:12:01,628
Yes.

963
01:12:07,015 --> 01:12:08,059
I stood here...

964
01:12:09,231 --> 01:12:10,059
with my father.

965
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:11,800
When I was your age.

966
01:12:12,512 --> 01:12:13,858
He told me its...

967
01:12:13,859 --> 01:12:16,432
'Magic kungfu water'.

968
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,704
You drink and nothing can defeat you.

969
01:12:39,744 --> 01:12:41,969
It's the best water that I ever tasted.

970
01:12:45,547 --> 01:12:47,045
Did you see the lady with the snake?

971
01:12:47,899 --> 01:12:48,715
Yes.

972
01:12:48,716 --> 01:12:49,716
She was doing the cobra thing.

973
01:12:50,139 --> 01:12:51,023
She was like...

974
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:53,153
copying the snake and it was like...

975
01:12:53,599 --> 01:12:54,932
right here and she was like...

976
01:12:57,438 --> 01:12:58,817
You did not watch closely enough.

977
01:12:58,818 --> 01:12:59,523
Xiao Dre.

978
01:13:00,702 --> 01:13:02,790
The snake was copying the woman.

979
01:13:04,032 --> 01:13:05,032
But.

980
01:13:05,815 --> 01:13:06,492
Don't get it.

981
01:13:15,575 --> 01:13:16,575
Look.

982
01:13:17,547 --> 01:13:18,547
What do you see?

983
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:20,163
Me

984
01:13:20,762 --> 01:13:21,762
My own reflection.

985
01:13:21,763 --> 01:13:22,763
Yes.

986
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:26,917
Now what do you see?

987
01:13:26,918 --> 01:13:27,918
It's blurry.

988
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:29,679
Yes.

989
01:13:29,564 --> 01:13:30,564
Women...

990
01:13:30,845 --> 01:13:31,845
like still water.

991
01:13:32,347 --> 01:13:33,347
Quiet.

992
01:13:33,348 --> 01:13:34,348
Calm.

993
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:35,813
In here.

994
01:13:35,814 --> 01:13:36,814
And in here.

995
01:13:37,304 --> 01:13:38,304
So.

996
01:13:38,305 --> 01:13:39,305
The snake.

997
01:13:40,435 --> 01:13:41,891
Reflects her action.

998
01:13:41,892 --> 01:13:42,892
Like still water.

999
01:13:43,866 --> 01:13:44,475
Like a mirror.

1000
01:13:44,476 --> 01:13:45,476
Yes.

1001
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:48,197
So...

1002
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:50,492
she controlled a snake by doing nothing?

1003
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,219
Be still and doing nothing.

1004
01:13:56,003 --> 01:13:57,533
Are two very different things.

1005
01:14:01,811 --> 01:14:03,752
She used her chi essense didn't she?

1006
01:14:03,753 --> 01:14:04,753
Very good.

1007
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:06,163
You gotta teach me that like...

1008
01:14:06,164 --> 01:14:07,418
how to control people.

1009
01:14:09,011 --> 01:14:11,524
There's only one person you
need to learn how to control.

1010
01:14:16,402 --> 01:14:17,402
Who?

1011
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,987
Empty your mind!

1012
01:14:20,464 --> 01:14:21,904
Flow with my movement.

1013
01:14:21,905 --> 01:14:23,515
Connect through the energy.

1014
01:14:24,064 --> 01:14:24,887
Around you.

1015
01:14:25,276 --> 01:14:26,784
I kinda just want to learn the cobra thing.

1016
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,711
Cobra.

1017
01:14:28,712 --> 01:14:29,943
Takes a lifetime.

1018
01:14:29,944 --> 01:14:31,624
Requires great focus.

1019
01:14:31,625 --> 01:14:32,625
But how great focus?

1020
01:14:34,818 --> 01:14:35,818
Woah...!

1021
01:14:37,078 --> 01:14:37,814
Oh my god.

1022
01:14:37,815 --> 01:14:38,477
Mr. Han?

1023
01:14:38,478 --> 01:14:39,478
Your focus.

1024
01:14:39,847 --> 01:14:40,847
Needs more focus.

1025
01:14:42,282 --> 01:14:43,282
Mr. Han?

1026
01:15:21,011 --> 01:15:22,209
Thank you Mr. Han.

1027
01:15:43,550 --> 01:15:46,168
There's no such thing as fortune cookies in China.

1028
01:15:47,296 --> 01:15:48,687
Dre, please be careful crossing the street.

1029
01:15:49,948 --> 01:15:51,433
You just scared the life outta me the other day.

1030
01:15:53,698 --> 01:15:54,829
Have the right of way.

1031
01:15:58,448 --> 01:15:58,949
And the symbols.

1032
01:15:58,950 --> 01:16:00,719
I can't get the symbols right on the bathrooms.

1033
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:01,706
And I stay.

1034
01:16:01,705 --> 01:16:03,909
Walking into the men's restroom.

1035
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:04,953
The other day I walked in...

1036
01:16:05,266 --> 01:16:07,037
There was a ninety year old chinese man.

1037
01:16:07,038 --> 01:16:08,038
He thought he was going to get a little treat.

1038
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:09,429
Dre, please stop that!

1039
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:10,223
You look crazy.

1040
01:16:09,525 --> 01:16:11,431
Here! Eat your noodles!

1041
01:16:18,898 --> 01:16:19,687
Ouch!

1042
01:16:19,688 --> 01:16:20,899
Uggh!

1043
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:28,065
Up.

1044
01:16:35,706 --> 01:16:36,785
Mr. Han what's going on?

1045
01:16:37,690 --> 01:16:38,690
Ooh!

1046
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:39,791
Wow!

1047
01:16:39,936 --> 01:16:40,936
Anticipation.

1048
01:16:42,695 --> 01:16:43,874
I can't see that...

1049
01:16:44,551 --> 01:16:45,802
Don't see it. Feel it.

1050
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:47,988
Dammit Mr. Han!

1051
01:16:49,083 --> 01:16:50,167
I felt that one!

1052
01:16:53,946 --> 01:16:54,658
Mr. Han!

1053
01:16:54,659 --> 01:16:55,659
What?

1054
01:17:01,142 --> 01:17:02,507
Concentrate.

1055
01:17:02,508 --> 01:17:03,168
Okay.

1056
01:17:03,169 --> 01:17:04,023
Okay, do I get the stick now?

1057
01:17:23,647 --> 01:17:24,647
Woah!

1058
01:17:24,648 --> 01:17:25,648
Ouch!

1059
01:17:25,649 --> 01:17:26,649
Dre! You okay?

1060
01:17:26,650 --> 01:17:27,650
I'm okay.

1061
01:17:32,463 --> 01:17:33,711
So Mr. Han what time we training tomorrow?

1062
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:36,640
Xiao Dre, we're not training tomorrow.

1063
01:17:38,981 --> 01:17:39,984
Why not?

1064
01:17:42,094 --> 01:17:43,380
<i> Wu Ji Bi Fan (Haste makes waste). </i>

1065
01:17:43,593 --> 01:17:44,618
<i> Wu Ji Bi Fan (Haste makes waste). </i>

1066
01:17:44,991 --> 01:17:46,896
Means too much something is not good.

1067
01:17:47,644 --> 01:17:48,775
You train a lot.

1068
01:17:48,715 --> 01:17:49,715
You need rest.

1069
01:17:50,522 --> 01:17:51,522
A day off!

1070
01:17:52,863 --> 01:17:53,863
Yes! Mr. Han.

1071
01:17:53,864 --> 01:17:54,864
Yes!

1072
01:17:54,865 --> 01:17:56,879
Xiao Dre need to REST!

1073
01:17:57,846 --> 01:17:58,846
Yes, Mr. Han.

1074
01:17:59,147 --> 01:18:00,147
You rest too.

1075
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,999
Love you Mr. Han.

1076
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,720
Peace!

1077
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:18,458
Hey!

1078
01:18:20,474 --> 01:18:21,450
Are you okay?

1079
01:18:21,918 --> 01:18:23,683
My audition is tomorrow on the sixth.

1080
01:18:24,750 --> 01:18:26,258
But isn't that what you've been auditioning for?

1081
01:18:26,259 --> 01:18:27,860
Yes, of course.

1082
01:18:29,219 --> 01:18:30,581
Don't worry. You got it.

1083
01:18:31,307 --> 01:18:32,806
What if they don't pick me?

1084
01:18:36,362 --> 01:18:37,052
Meiying wait!

1085
01:18:38,567 --> 01:18:39,567
Okay.

1086
01:18:39,568 --> 01:18:40,475
First of all.

1087
01:18:40,476 --> 01:18:41,452
I'm gonna be there with you.

1088
01:18:41,866 --> 01:18:42,866
And B...

1089
01:18:42,775 --> 01:18:44,419
All you have to do is do
what your teacher says.

1090
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:45,420
Play the pauses.

1091
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,662
It's easy watch!

1092
01:18:49,997 --> 01:18:50,997
See?

1093
01:18:53,341 --> 01:18:54,848
I have to practise.

1094
01:18:55,745 --> 01:18:56,745
Wait!

1095
01:18:57,464 --> 01:18:58,464
Would you be fun!

1096
01:18:58,959 --> 01:18:59,959
What?

1097
01:19:00,097 --> 01:19:01,744
I'm sorry. I think you don't
speak chinese.

1098
01:19:01,745 --> 01:19:02,908
Would you be fun!

1099
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:05,968
Too much good stuff fits bad stuff.

1100
01:19:06,772 --> 01:19:07,772
Oh!

1101
01:19:07,730 --> 01:19:09,271
Wu Ji Bi Fan (Haste makes waste).

1102
01:19:09,272 --> 01:19:10,272
Yeah!

1103
01:19:10,273 --> 01:19:11,651
Would you be fun!

1104
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:14,660
C'mon!

1105
01:19:15,148 --> 01:19:15,922
Where are we going?

1106
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,221
Darn! Have you been to the gym?

1107
01:19:17,222 --> 01:19:18,948
No!
- C'mon we're gonna have some fun!

1108
01:19:18,669 --> 01:19:19,669
Dre!

1109
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:21,876
C'mon! I know you wanna go have so fun.

1110
01:20:01,856 --> 01:20:02,345
Don't do it.

1111
01:20:03,026 --> 01:20:03,793
Don't do it.

1112
01:20:06,898 --> 01:20:07,898
What do you see?

1113
01:20:08,086 --> 01:20:09,086
Me.

1114
01:20:10,086 --> 01:20:11,086
Now! what do you see?

1115
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:13,370
Me.

1116
01:20:42,895 --> 01:20:44,039
You go c'mon!

1117
01:20:45,203 --> 01:20:46,203
C'mon!

1118
01:20:46,277 --> 01:20:47,329
You know you can dance.

1119
01:20:48,066 --> 01:20:49,066
Go ahead!

1120
01:21:46,525 --> 01:21:47,525
Hooof...

1121
01:21:49,084 --> 01:21:49,620
That's like...

1122
01:21:49,621 --> 01:21:50,843
Amm... American dancing like.

1123
01:21:50,844 --> 01:21:52,151
You should have a group.

1124
01:21:52,152 --> 01:21:53,163
No!

1125
01:21:53,234 --> 01:21:54,675
With like other people in it.

1126
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:56,039
And they're dancing behind you.

1127
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:57,040
Doing the same stuff.

1128
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:05,375
<i> Hello? </i>

1129
01:22:05,376 --> 01:22:06,376
<i> I'm sorry. </i>

1130
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:08,614
<i> I understand. </i>

1131
01:22:10,515 --> 01:22:11,515
The Audition...

1132
01:22:11,516 --> 01:22:13,155
It was changed to two today.

1133
01:22:13,156 --> 01:22:15,049
But they said it was tomorrow.
- How could it happen.

1134
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:16,473
It's in twenty minutes.

1135
01:22:17,408 --> 01:22:19,111
My father is coming to get me.

1136
01:22:30,881 --> 01:22:31,934
<i> Meiying's mother: What were you thinking? </i>

1137
01:22:31,935 --> 01:22:33,205
<i> Where did you go? </i>

1138
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:04,873
Excuse me, Sir!

1139
01:23:06,943 --> 01:23:07,924
Excuse me, coming through!

1140
01:23:18,487 --> 01:23:19,487
<i> They're here. </i>

1141
01:23:20,989 --> 01:23:21,989
C'mon, c'mon...

1142
01:24:21,536 --> 01:24:22,536
Excuse me!

1143
01:25:14,799 --> 01:25:15,413
Hey! She's like...

1144
01:25:15,414 --> 01:25:16,407
totally gonna get it right?

1145
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:17,858
Because that was just...

1146
01:25:17,859 --> 01:25:18,859
Great!

1147
01:25:51,627 --> 01:25:52,627
Hey!

1148
01:25:52,575 --> 01:25:53,059
That was ...

1149
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,629
Fantastic!

1150
01:25:55,043 --> 01:25:56,093
That was... You just...

1151
01:25:56,094 --> 01:25:57,827
You played so beautifully and...

1152
01:25:59,319 --> 01:26:01,857
We can no longer be friends.

1153
01:26:03,071 --> 01:26:04,510
You are bad for my life.

1154
01:26:18,645 --> 01:26:19,132
See you at the tournament.

1155
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:22,843
Don't be late for that!

1156
01:27:07,172 --> 01:27:08,172
Mr... Mr. Han!

1157
01:27:09,111 --> 01:27:10,141
Mr. HAN!

1158
01:27:15,098 --> 01:27:16,989
We'll not train today.

1159
01:27:31,463 --> 01:27:33,049
What are you doing?

1160
01:27:34,355 --> 01:27:35,593
It's July 8th.

1161
01:28:46,084 --> 01:28:47,084
Why'd you break the car?

1162
01:29:05,954 --> 01:29:07,395
His name was Gang Gang.

1163
01:29:10,106 --> 01:29:11,971
Xiao Dre, how old are you?

1164
01:29:13,429 --> 01:29:14,429
Twelve.

1165
01:29:15,951 --> 01:29:16,951
He was ten.

1166
01:29:19,599 --> 01:29:21,254
He was so beautiful.

1167
01:29:25,026 --> 01:29:26,516
Her name was Zhang.

1168
01:29:28,784 --> 01:29:29,784
She was a singer.

1169
01:29:34,259 --> 01:29:35,529
Not professional.

1170
01:29:38,355 --> 01:29:40,114
She sing only for me.

1171
01:30:17,078 --> 01:30:18,078
What happened?

1172
01:30:27,514 --> 01:30:29,083
It was a steep hill.

1173
01:30:30,234 --> 01:30:31,926
Lots of rain.

1174
01:30:34,209 --> 01:30:36,083
The car just...

1175
01:30:39,068 --> 01:30:40,020
I was driving.

1176
01:30:42,346 --> 01:30:43,529
We argued about something.

1177
01:30:45,866 --> 01:30:47,418
I was so angry...

1178
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:49,874
I lost control.

1179
01:30:51,643 --> 01:30:52,894
I try to remember...

1180
01:30:55,020 --> 01:30:57,283
I try to remember what we were arguing about...

1181
01:30:59,483 --> 01:31:01,712
I hope it was something important.

1182
01:31:05,154 --> 01:31:06,727
Every year...

1183
01:31:08,395 --> 01:31:09,399
I fix a car...

1184
01:31:11,306 --> 01:31:12,747
still fix nothing.

1185
01:34:50,771 --> 01:34:51,771
Punch!

1186
01:34:53,723 --> 01:34:54,723
Good.

1187
01:35:52,146 --> 01:35:53,146
Mr. Han!

1188
01:36:23,618 --> 01:36:24,618
Down!

1189
01:36:45,194 --> 01:36:46,194
One more.

1190
01:36:49,858 --> 01:36:50,858
Hurry!

1191
01:37:41,143 --> 01:37:42,143
Win or lose!

1192
01:37:42,162 --> 01:37:43,363
Doesn't matter.

1193
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,690
Fight hard.

1194
01:37:47,978 --> 01:37:48,730
Earn respect.

1195
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:51,099
Boys will leave you alone.

1196

Have present for you.

1197
01:38:02,907 --> 01:38:03,907
Mr. Han!

1198
01:38:05,030 --> 01:38:06,030
Man!

1199
01:38:06,031 --> 01:38:07,796

1200
01:38:08,754 --> 01:38:09,754
Great!

1201
01:38:11,130 --> 01:38:12,130
Thank you.

1202
01:38:15,873 --> 01:38:17,530
You have taught me a very important lesson.

1203
01:38:17,531 --> 01:38:18,259
Xiao Dre.

1204
01:38:20,834 --> 01:38:21,834
Life.

1205
01:38:21,835 --> 01:38:22,933
Will knock us down.

1206
01:38:23,837 --> 01:38:24,842
But we can choose...

1207
01:38:24,843 --> 01:38:25,800
whether or not...

1208
01:38:26,501 --> 01:38:27,496
to get back up.

1209
01:38:31,293 --> 01:38:32,729
You're the best friend I ever had.

1210
01:38:32,730 --> 01:38:34,462
Mr. Han.

1211
01:38:51,492 --> 01:38:52,492
Okay.

1212

Wait! Aa...

1213
01:38:57,271 --> 01:38:59,313
Can you help me with something?

1214
01:39:04,251 --> 01:39:05,251
Dre...

1215
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:06,992
Is your dad home?

1216
01:39:12,984 --> 01:39:14,337
<i> Meiying's father... </i>

1217
01:39:15,585 --> 01:39:16,664
<i> My name is Dre Parker...</i>

<i> Meiying was once...</i>

1221
01:39:26,614 --> 01:39:29,342
<i> a very good friend of mine. </i>

1222
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,400
<i> She has taught me,</i>

1223
01:39:33,439 --> 01:39:35,380
<i> what true friendship means.</i>

1224
01:39:35,388 --> 01:39:38,153
<i> I would like to be given another chance.</i>

1225
01:39:38,423 --> 01:39:41,490
<i> I would accept any punishment. </i>

1226
01:39:41,494 --> 01:39:43,310
<i> If I am unable to honour our friendship. </i>

1227

<i> I hereby would like to ask for your permission

<i> Meiying have told me that she have promised
to be there when you compete. </i>

<i> Our family have never gone back on our promises. </i>

1232
01:40:14,746 --> 01:40:15,684
My daughter told me,

1233
01:40:15,685 --> 01:40:20,294
that she made a promise to be at your tournament.

1234
01:40:20,006 --> 01:40:20,737
In our family,

1235
01:40:20,738 --> 01:40:23,099
we do not break our promises.

1236

Don't let him hit you.

1253

What?

1254

Just tell me Xiao Dre...

Why?

1367
01:52:09,794 --> 01:52:12,065
Why you need to go back out there so badly?

1368
