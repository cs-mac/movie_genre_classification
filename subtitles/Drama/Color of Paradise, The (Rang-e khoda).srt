1
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:23,186
If yet your blood does not rage, then
it is waterthat flows in your veins.

2
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:28,622
For what is the flush of youth,
if it is not of service to the motherland.

3
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:11,330
Just a minute Mr. McKinley,
one revolutionary is meeting another.

4
00:02:17,278 --> 00:02:19,405
Thank you.
Shall we go?

5
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:23,079
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

6
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:29,483
This isn't the end Mr. McKinley.
This is just the beginning.

7
00:02:30,624 --> 00:02:33,821
There will be others after
we have gone. Many others.

8
00:08:21,608 --> 00:08:23,235
Shove it.

9
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:00,943
Get out of the way! Scoot!

10
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:04,117
<i>You come India first time madam?
Yes!</i>

11
00:09:16,997 --> 00:09:20,296
Sorry about the short notice.

12
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:24,460
Gosh! Your Hindi has
really improved.

13
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:27,136
Don't worry,
all the preparations are done.

14
00:09:41,188 --> 00:09:44,385
Hey Sue, no need to worry...

15
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:48,919
...everything has been taken care of
posters have been put up everywhere.

16
00:09:49,196 --> 00:09:50,663
It's also been announced on radio.

17
00:09:51,198 --> 00:09:53,257
...just see, they'll be lining
up forthe auditions.

18
00:09:56,203 --> 00:09:57,397
What's wrong?

19
00:09:59,373 --> 00:10:06,074
I didn't tell you.
The truth is that I've come alone.

20
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,680
...no money, no producer is going to arrive.

21
00:10:10,884 --> 00:10:13,182
You knew it!

22
00:10:14,888 --> 00:10:19,757
After Alice, there was a
call from a certain Beth Williams...

23
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:23,685
...she informed me of the cancellation
of the show and also my services.

24
00:10:26,567 --> 00:10:31,869
...did you abuse her in Hindi?

25
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:38,640
She wanted to know what it meant.
I explained to her in graphic detail.

26
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:45,977
You are amazing... Sonia.

27
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:13,402
This is Delhi University.
Let me help you with your luggage.

28
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:16,811
<i>How much?
- Ma'am I've already told you.</i>

29
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:23,817
Ravi, please get all the
luggage to our room.

30
00:11:48,982 --> 00:11:51,280
Get some rest now.
I'll see you tomorrow...

31
00:11:51,818 --> 00:11:54,048
...lf you need anything
you have my number.

32
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,957
Let's go Ravi.

33
00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:03,486
I can't do this.

34
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,222
I can't do this.

35
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:18,566
I deserve a role because
I have dimples just like Priety Zinta.

36
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,879
<i>Don't sing. Just recite "Vande Matram".
- Vande Matram?</i>

37
00:14:20,434 --> 00:14:23,062
<i>Raise your hand and say VANDE MATRAM!
VANDE Matram!</i>

38
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:25,898
<i>Speak loudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vande MATRAM.</i>

39
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:29,564
<i>Loudly and proudly, VANDE MATRAM!
Vande MATRAM</i>

40
00:14:29,776 --> 00:14:32,074
<i>VANDE MATRAM!
Vande Matram...</i>

41
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,408
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

42
00:14:36,783 --> 00:14:38,751
I have dedicated my life
to the freedom of this nation.

43
00:14:39,286 --> 00:14:41,254
I know you want me to get married.

44
00:14:41,788 --> 00:14:44,916
...but FREEDOM is my bride.

45
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:48,758
I know... I know... that...

46
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,596
I know... that you want me to get married...

47
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:58,267
...but my bride is FREEDOM

48
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:04,599
...but my bride is FREEDOM.
Your obedient son, BHAGAT SINGH.

49
00:15:05,412 --> 00:15:06,106
BHAGAT SINGH.

50
00:15:06,646 --> 00:15:07,271
Bhagat Singh.

51
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:09,111
Bhagat Singh.

52
00:15:11,651 --> 00:15:14,119
My name is Bhagat Singh.

53
00:15:21,761 --> 00:15:24,730
<i>Tea!
Thanks.</i>

54
00:15:28,835 --> 00:15:30,462
Depressed huh?

55
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:34,566
One ortwo of them can
be used for minor roles...

56
00:15:35,175 --> 00:15:38,975
...but no one's even close for
Azad or Bhagat Singh.

57
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:42,406
I guess it's all my fault.

58
00:15:42,682 --> 00:15:46,413
No Sonia. You're my rock.

59
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:51,919
Sue, don't get so dejected.

60
00:15:54,528 --> 00:15:56,826
Let's go and have some fun.
I'm in no mood Sonia.

61
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:25,688
Hey Aslam.

62
00:16:38,972 --> 00:16:40,439
Aslam... Sue McKinley.

63
00:16:41,474 --> 00:16:42,771
You too study at the University?

64
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:44,773
Wow! Her Hindi is great.

65
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:50,443
We live there, eat there but no one
has ever accused us of studying there.

66
00:17:18,678 --> 00:17:19,975
What are those maniacs upto?

67
00:17:21,014 --> 00:17:21,981
That's DJ...

68
00:17:22,282 --> 00:17:23,647
DJ I love you!!!

69
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,252
That's Sukhi.

70
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,261
DJ I love you!!!

71
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:40,095
I love you too baby!

72
00:17:54,314 --> 00:17:55,508
Damn exhibitionists.

73
00:17:57,717 --> 00:17:59,014
The idiots will never change.

74
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:03,852
Come on dude, let's rock it!

75
00:18:08,228 --> 00:18:10,355
Sukhi I love you!

76
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:36,920
Is he OK?

77
00:18:37,123 --> 00:18:39,057
That's his natural state.

78
00:18:39,259 --> 00:18:46,290
Sukhi, all parts working?

79
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,431
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

80
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,934
Sue this is DJ.
DJ this is Sue.

81
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:56,734
Hi!

82
00:18:57,777 --> 00:19:01,577
Sue? She's so pink her name
should be Gulabo (Rose).

83
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,917
She's quite hot...

84
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:07,586
Perfect forthis cold.

85
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:17,423
Karan you saved my life.
I love you!

86
00:19:18,631 --> 00:19:19,427
Aslam...

87
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,930
...you too saved my life,

88
00:19:22,635 --> 00:19:24,034
I love you too!

89
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:26,439
It's ok.

90
00:19:30,143 --> 00:19:31,940
She must have saved my life too...

91
00:19:32,145 --> 00:19:34,272
No! Sukhi!
She didn't save your life.

92
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:37,109
No problem. One day
she'll save my life.

93
00:19:37,484 --> 00:19:43,389
Relax Dude!
She is your sister-in-law.

94
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:55,261
LOOSE CONTROL

95
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:17,479
I'm a REBEL.

96
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:23,659
<i>There's aren't any students here,
no teachers to suffer.</i>

97
00:20:30,537 --> 00:20:36,339
<i>It's a school without rules out here
Hey Genius, go figure.</i>

98
00:20:48,555 --> 00:20:51,683
Sukhi you just sit and
watch like a dumb-ass...

99
00:20:52,225 --> 00:20:53,590
DJ doesn't waste a second.

100
00:20:53,793 --> 00:20:55,124
He's a stud.

101
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:57,796
Hi! How's everybody?
Hi Rahul! What's up?

102
00:20:58,898 --> 00:21:00,195
Got a few gigs lined up.

103
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,027
How's your radio thing going?

104
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,032
Did anything work out?

105
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,370
All India Radio has
given me a night slot.

106
00:21:08,074 --> 00:21:09,268
Cool...

107
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:14,604
Not really. When the whole world's
sleeping I'm on air.

108
00:21:14,814 --> 00:21:16,611
But people stay up late...

109
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:21,114
Criminals, insomniacs,
watchmen and idiots!

110
00:21:21,921 --> 00:21:24,287
Have yourfun at my expense.

111
00:21:24,757 --> 00:21:25,883
Speaking of expenses...
Can I...

112
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,731
See you guys.
Got a cigarette?

113
00:21:44,944 --> 00:21:46,741
Fabulous!

114
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:49,745
It's my Dad's money.
He's got lots of it...

115
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,092
Stop this Western music,
this obscenity!

116
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,587
How many times do
I have to make you understand this!

117
00:22:04,464 --> 00:22:06,762
Polluting the culture of this country...

118
00:22:07,133 --> 00:22:10,261
Leave this place right now.
LEAVE!

119
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,769
Can't you understand, idiot!

120
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,602
This is your last warning...

121
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:23,372
...from now on, nobody plays
any Western music out here.

122
00:22:24,484 --> 00:22:25,610
No lewd dancing!

123
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,882
Or I'll break your legs.

124
00:22:32,158 --> 00:22:35,127
Who are you to warn us?
If you don't like it, don't come here.

125
00:22:35,328 --> 00:22:37,296
You bloody Pakistani!

126
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:45,634
Let's finish it.

127
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:08,058
Last warning! Got it?

128
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:13,389
Long live India!

129
00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:23,573
You touch Aslam and
see what I do to you...

130
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:25,835
...even your mother won't recognize you.

131
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,643
Ever seen a baboons arse? Yours will
be as red after I've finished with you.

132
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:36,514
Sir, I'm sure we can work it out.

133
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:45,853
Keep this...

134
00:23:51,237 --> 00:23:55,367
Anyone hungry? I'm famished.

135
00:25:56,028 --> 00:25:56,653
How're you?

136
00:25:58,197 --> 00:26:00,757
Hey honey! Come here you...

137
00:26:04,203 --> 00:26:07,001
If something happened to you,
I'd have killed you.

138
00:26:07,373 --> 00:26:09,000
Is this any way to greet your boyfriend?

139
00:26:12,211 --> 00:26:12,677
How're you?

140
00:26:28,728 --> 00:26:29,922
Hurry guys, I'm famished.

141
00:26:30,129 --> 00:26:31,687
You won't get any food here.

142
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,366
Stay away!

143
00:26:38,571 --> 00:26:41,039
...I carried you in my stomach
for nine months...

144
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,868
...and washed your bum foryears.

145
00:26:44,677 --> 00:26:45,268
Get lost!

146
00:26:45,845 --> 00:26:49,042
Does anyone botherto check
if Mitro is alive or dead?

147
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:50,044
What's up?

148
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:52,050
You're drunk again.

149
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:55,046
No. No. No.

150
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:58,051
First give us food ma,
and then yell at us all night.

151
00:26:59,292 --> 00:27:01,886
None of you have eaten?

152
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:05,393
Sonia you've lost even more weight.

153
00:27:05,598 --> 00:27:06,223
Really... Mitro

154
00:27:06,432 --> 00:27:10,232
The girls of today have
more bones and less flesh...

155
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:12,063
How will you bear children?

156
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:19,639
Aslam, how are you my son?

157
00:27:19,845 --> 00:27:22,405
He is my true son
who bothers to check on me.

158
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:26,415
And you...

159
00:27:27,954 --> 00:27:31,082
Look ma, what I brought foryou.

160
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:34,756
Your daughter-in-law.
Her name is Sue.

161
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,589
What? Aforeigner?

162
00:27:38,130 --> 00:27:42,032
Brought her especially from London.
That's why I was away for so long.

163
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:46,932
Give me your blessings Ma.

164
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:50,933
Your son's such a brat.

165
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:57,438
God! She understands Hindi!

166
00:28:00,152 --> 00:28:04,953
<i>You really understand everything?
Yes.</i>

167
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:14,224
I'm going off to sleep. Your beds are
all ready. No need to drive so late at night.

168
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,007
Sue, where are you?

169
00:28:57,043 --> 00:28:58,738
Will you guys act in my film?

170
00:28:59,378 --> 00:29:00,003
What?

171
00:29:04,383 --> 00:29:08,183
Hey, why are you guys laughing?
I'm the hero of herfilm.

172
00:29:09,388 --> 00:29:11,185
Yeah we guys are champions
when it comes to acting...

173
00:29:11,557 --> 00:29:13,354
...clowning around is all they do.

174
00:29:16,062 --> 00:29:19,293
The four of you will be
perfect forthe roles...

175
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:24,198
And Sonia will be my Durga Bhabhi.

176
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,094
She really knows Hindi!

177
00:29:27,139 --> 00:29:30,040
All this talk of patriotism is boring.

178
00:29:30,242 --> 00:29:34,303
Boring? These guys gave their
lives forthe freedom of your country.

179
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:37,215
What freedom? Have you seen
the state of this country?

180
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:40,385
Excuse me! I believe in this country, Karan.

181
00:29:40,753 --> 00:29:45,383
Otherwise, why would
I be fighting for it?

182
00:29:45,758 --> 00:29:49,717
Maybe because it's cool!
Being a pilot... flying an expensive plane.

183
00:29:50,096 --> 00:29:51,222
You get to wear sexy jackets...

184
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:55,560
And the women...
women love men in uniforms.

185
00:29:55,801 --> 00:29:58,235
Sure I love being a pilot.
Sure it's cool.

186
00:29:58,404 --> 00:30:02,238
But I also feel proud of my country,
and I can give my life for it.

187
00:30:02,975 --> 00:30:06,069
Proud of what?

188
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:07,336
...this country's exploding population?

189
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:09,573
...or unemployment...
or corruption?

190
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:11,246
Which of these are you really proud of?

191
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,352
No country's perfect Karan.
We've got to make it better.

192
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:16,020
Right.

193
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:20,482
Ok, Ajay you make
this country perfect.

194
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,591
The minute I get my degree
I'm out of this dump...

195
00:30:24,797 --> 00:30:27,265
You won't be able
to leave us and go.

196
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,929
She speaks Hindi so well!

197
00:30:33,072 --> 00:30:38,169
Why didn't you tell me you idiot.
I was making a fool of myself.

198
00:30:44,417 --> 00:30:47,511
At least ask them once.

199
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,846
So you won't give up.

200
00:30:50,656 --> 00:30:53,955
Ok. But nobody will turn up.

201
00:30:54,827 --> 00:31:01,130
I'll get them. That's a promise.

202
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:07,639
Karan put your cigarette out.

203
00:31:10,776 --> 00:31:11,800
Grandpa!

204
00:31:12,511 --> 00:31:15,480
God bless you.
When did you come?

205
00:31:15,681 --> 00:31:19,742
Just last night.

206
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:06,830
Good morning Karan.
Back so early?

207
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:10,561
I didn't know you were in town.

208
00:32:12,104 --> 00:32:13,628
Just arrived an hour ago.

209
00:32:14,507 --> 00:32:18,500
It was a long flight...
Everything Ok at college?

210
00:32:19,778 --> 00:32:20,403
Everything's fine Dad.

211
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:24,071
Have you decided which American
university you want to go to next year?

212
00:32:25,684 --> 00:32:30,951
Michigan, Carnegie,
Mellon, Wharton...

213
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,090
I know the list.

214
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:37,925
Hello...

215
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:39,261
Karan wait!

216
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:45,593
I can't hearyou clearly
call me later.

217
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,864
I know that you know about the lists.

218
00:32:51,243 --> 00:32:53,211
But life doesn't just happen to you.

219
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,503
You've got to plan it...

220
00:32:56,649 --> 00:32:59,345
Every second someone
is born in this country.

221
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,948
Nobody cares about them.
Neitherthe government nor God.

222
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:10,891
Do something.
Or else you will be one of them.

223
00:33:11,163 --> 00:33:12,960
Please, don't start with your lectures.

224
00:33:14,333 --> 00:33:18,292
SMS generation.
Any conversation that goes beyond...

225
00:33:18,504 --> 00:33:19,630
...four lines becomes a lecture.

226
00:33:23,576 --> 00:33:27,979
Signal's weak here. Give me a second.
Excuse me Karan.

227
00:33:29,848 --> 00:33:34,148
The deal is off then,
we are not interested...

228
00:33:37,957 --> 00:33:41,154
You know Russian quality is doubtful,
they can't afford to be arrogant.

229
00:33:43,929 --> 00:33:48,298
Anyway in the open market they'd not get
anything close to the price we're offering.

230
00:33:48,434 --> 00:33:53,269
And you know how many fathers
there are to every deal in India. Nothing.

231
00:33:53,906 --> 00:34:03,679
Tell them we won't bargain,
they should wire the money to us.

232
00:34:28,774 --> 00:34:31,675
I did try to warn you...
they won't turn up.

233
00:34:31,877 --> 00:34:33,504
DJ promised me.

234
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:35,577
Oh! DJ promised you!

235
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:37,381
So you really are a filmmaker?

236
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:40,609
Karan... Why are you so late?

237
00:34:42,254 --> 00:34:43,221
And where are the others?

238
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:50,388
The Young Guns Of India.
Very dramatic.

239
00:34:53,565 --> 00:34:56,261
Where are you going?

240
00:34:56,502 --> 00:34:59,027
Well that's one part cast.

241
00:34:59,471 --> 00:35:03,134
I am sure Karan can tell us
where his friends are.

242
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:19,223
She's an eight. Yeah!

243
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:20,422
Wow! Nine.

244
00:35:20,626 --> 00:35:22,025
<i>What a girl!
Oye Chotu...</i>

245
00:35:22,227 --> 00:35:23,956
...get me a cup of tea...

246
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,892
Two, looks like she's got the flu...

247
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:29,859
Six...

248
00:35:30,769 --> 00:35:34,170
Ten!
What?

249
00:35:36,408 --> 00:35:39,707
Dude... Iooks at those legs!

250
00:35:40,913 --> 00:35:43,882
Shake it baby, shake it...

251
00:35:44,483 --> 00:35:45,142
Oh shit!

252
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,977
Don't be silly,
that's at least an eight.

253
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:49,916
Thought I'd find you
stuffing yourfaces.

254
00:35:50,589 --> 00:35:52,784
You lazy good-for-nothings.

255
00:35:53,225 --> 00:35:55,250
We were about to come... but...

256
00:35:55,494 --> 00:35:57,428
...we are waiting for Karan actually.

257
00:35:57,863 --> 00:35:59,194
<i>Oh! So you were waiting for Karan.
Yeah!</i>

258
00:35:59,832 --> 00:36:01,459
Karan was there on time.

259
00:36:03,302 --> 00:36:06,169
We are waiting for him here
and he was waiting for us there.

260
00:36:06,371 --> 00:36:08,532
What confusion...

261
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:12,471
You're Ashfaqulla Khan.

262
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,203
<i>You're Rajguru.
The hero right!</i>

263
00:36:15,414 --> 00:36:16,813
And you know who you are?

264
00:36:17,149 --> 00:36:19,743
The Master of Disguise
and Deception.

265
00:36:19,952 --> 00:36:21,112
Chandrashekhar Azad.

266
00:36:22,154 --> 00:36:23,485
What lips...

267
00:36:23,989 --> 00:36:26,583
Learn the lines properly,
we meet tomorrow.

268
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:29,888
8 a.m. Sharp!

269
00:36:30,095 --> 00:36:32,359
<i>Nine.
Sharp at eight.</i>

270
00:36:32,564 --> 00:36:35,362
<i>That's fine.
We've already wasted a day...</i>

271
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,041
Aslam, your sister-in-law looks
even better when she's angry.

272
00:36:55,788 --> 00:36:56,948
What are you doing Laxman?

273
00:37:00,025 --> 00:37:01,322
Greetings Mishraji.

274
00:37:01,693 --> 00:37:04,491
Party High Command is really
happy with your work.

275
00:37:04,997 --> 00:37:09,400
These demonstrations that you have
started against Western culture...

276
00:37:09,802 --> 00:37:13,294
...they've helped us
overshadow other parties.

277
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:26,083
This is foryou.
And this is foryour boys.

278
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:28,881
It's not necessary, Mishraji.

279
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,279
I'm not doing this for money.

280
00:37:31,757 --> 00:37:34,351
I really believe in the
principles of my party.

281
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:36,761
That's fine Laxman...

282
00:37:37,396 --> 00:37:43,301
...but every movement
needs fuel... Keep it.

283
00:38:05,457 --> 00:38:09,985
There is nothing
you can do to break me.

284
00:38:10,362 --> 00:38:12,956
"Because I have made pain my friend."

285
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:17,262
"...As I hold Death's fingers."

286
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:32,707
DJ idiot, don't spoil my concentration.

287
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:38,681
Look, Death's finger.

288
00:38:42,227 --> 00:38:44,821
"I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

289
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,830
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride..."

290
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:51,502
"Your obedient son, Bhagat Singh."

291
00:38:53,272 --> 00:38:55,934
Who talks like this for
God's sake?

292
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:57,836
My bride is freedom...

293
00:38:58,143 --> 00:39:00,543
I think it's a good line for Sukhi...

294
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:02,441
Since no girl is ever going to marry him...

295
00:39:02,681 --> 00:39:05,047
Let freedom be his bride.

296
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,684
Laugh bastards, laugh.

297
00:39:31,977 --> 00:39:34,309
This is the sari round
of the Miss Freedom contest.

298
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:37,907
Just thought it would help
me get into the character.

299
00:39:43,722 --> 00:39:45,883
Look guys this isn't going to work.

300
00:39:46,391 --> 00:39:50,691
You have to work hard to bring
out the characters.

301
00:39:51,363 --> 00:39:54,992
Unless you emote from within...

302
00:39:55,233 --> 00:39:56,928
...you won't understand these characters.

303
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:01,704
Try... it will come from within you.

304
00:40:01,907 --> 00:40:03,374
BURP

305
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:06,600
See, he's got a hold of his character already.

306
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:09,780
You understood the character pretty fast.

307
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:15,219
See! Now you look like a revolutionary!

308
00:40:15,787 --> 00:40:18,847
Whateveryou say Gulabo,
you need me to create the mood.

309
00:40:19,725 --> 00:40:21,522
DJ watch it.

310
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,518
Now she's upset!

311
00:40:30,736 --> 00:40:34,228
Those are the words of a 23 year old.

312
00:40:34,706 --> 00:40:37,869
That's how old Bhagat Singh
was when he died: 23.

313
00:40:38,443 --> 00:40:40,070
Those were different times Sue.

314
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:45,711
Today, if you tell people that
you want to give your life foryour country...

315
00:40:46,284 --> 00:40:47,273
...they'll call you nuts.

316
00:40:48,553 --> 00:40:49,315
Exactly.

317
00:40:50,822 --> 00:40:54,053
I don't think I can relate to this...

318
00:40:55,994 --> 00:40:57,325
That's it. Don't think.

319
00:40:57,863 --> 00:41:02,391
Feel. Just read the words,
Feel them.

320
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:05,529
Why don't we try again?

321
00:41:06,104 --> 00:41:07,696
Let's try again...

322
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:13,905
I've committed my life to
the freedom of this country.

323
00:41:16,148 --> 00:41:21,450
...a job... a well settled life...
these things don't matter anymore.

324
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:31,355
...I know you want me to get married,
but I have made freedom my bride...

325
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:48,874
I swear on Mother India...

326
00:42:02,661 --> 00:42:04,458
This Aslam is a real stud...

327
00:42:06,231 --> 00:42:11,533
Take a look at the packaging.
Poetry, palmistry!

328
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:17,203
DJ, I'm scared at times that
I'll remain a bachelor all my life.

329
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:22,678
Trust me I won't let you die a bachelor.

330
00:42:22,881 --> 00:42:23,506
Promise?

331
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,405
It's DJ's promise.

332
00:42:29,221 --> 00:42:34,818
You'll be writing people's destinies...

333
00:42:46,738 --> 00:42:48,501
Your love line is very strong...

334
00:42:49,541 --> 00:42:53,204
The man of your dreams will come
along in a black T-shirt and say:

335
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:01,883
Do I even have a love line?

336
00:43:02,087 --> 00:43:03,850
You must have washed it off in the loo.

337
00:43:04,055 --> 00:43:09,550
"Defence Minister Shastri has also been
implicated in the MIG-21 kickbacks scandal,"

338
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:13,697
This is really depressing.

339
00:43:13,899 --> 00:43:16,925
"This is a blatant lie.
I am ordering an investigation."

340
00:43:17,536 --> 00:43:27,502
UTv

341
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:55,859
See you guys.

342
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:59,798
You're my buddy...
I'll drop you home.

343
00:45:00,005 --> 00:45:02,906
I don't need any help,
it's just two lanes away.

344
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:06,977
We aren't so drunk...
that we've forgotten where you live.

345
00:45:20,292 --> 00:45:21,452
Idiots!

346
00:45:23,194 --> 00:45:24,957
You're very lucky to
have friends like them.

347
00:45:31,002 --> 00:45:33,470
One day this will all end.

348
00:45:34,673 --> 00:45:36,470
We'll all go our separate ways.

349
00:45:37,575 --> 00:45:40,135
But you can always keep in touch.

350
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,239
Doesn't happen.

351
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:45,006
Life gets busy.

352
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,981
Too many problems.
Getting a job, a house, money.

353
00:45:59,230 --> 00:46:02,666
In college we are the
masters of our destinies...

354
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:05,663
But after college we have
to dance to fate's tune.

355
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:18,109
You know Gulabo.
I passed out 5 years ago...

356
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,774
...but I still hang around...

357
00:46:21,219 --> 00:46:23,278
I don't understand.

358
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:27,549
...I don't ever want to leave college.

359
00:46:28,626 --> 00:46:29,251
Why?

360
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:36,233
At least in the campus
I'm someone... people know me.

361
00:46:37,402 --> 00:46:39,267
DJ's somebody...

362
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:46,667
People expect me to do
something big in life.

363
00:46:49,114 --> 00:46:52,345
But when I'm out on the streets...

364
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:58,416
I'll just be like the rest of
the slobs in this country.

365
00:47:09,267 --> 00:47:11,360
Nameless. Faceless. Scared.
Just walking the streets...

366
00:47:12,303 --> 00:47:15,830
It's the beer...
Everything came out.

367
00:47:19,944 --> 00:47:23,505
You know what else
I'm scared of?

368
00:47:25,216 --> 00:47:26,808
Acting in yourfilm.

369
00:47:28,486 --> 00:47:31,046
Don't worry... you're in safe hands.

370
00:47:51,776 --> 00:47:52,708
Where have you been?

371
00:47:54,345 --> 00:47:55,243
Hello Uncle... How are you?

372
00:48:00,518 --> 00:48:04,784
We'll catch up tomorrow Aslam...

373
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,026
You've been drinking?

374
00:48:14,165 --> 00:48:17,362
Dad, you know I don't drink.

375
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:21,169
<i>Good-for-nothings...
Whatever, they're my friends.</i>

376
00:48:21,372 --> 00:48:25,103
Friends! They feel no
shame standing in front of...

377
00:48:25,310 --> 00:48:28,074
...yourfather with alcohol on their breath.

378
00:48:28,413 --> 00:48:31,109
Why can't you get friends
in your own community?

379
00:48:31,816 --> 00:48:35,252
Why do you make friends with people
who corrupt you, disgrace your religion...

380
00:48:35,453 --> 00:48:37,148
This has nothing to
do with religion, Father.

381
00:48:37,355 --> 00:48:42,156
Shut up! Don't raise your voice
in the presence of yourfather.

382
00:48:43,628 --> 00:48:44,560
He's right.

383
00:48:46,331 --> 00:48:51,928
This country has never accepted
Muslims and it never will...

384
00:48:52,504 --> 00:48:53,937
How can you be so passive!

385
00:48:55,573 --> 00:48:58,508
Do you ever see me
mixing with a Hindu?

386
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:03,312
I'm not you and I don't want
to be like you brother.

387
00:49:05,049 --> 00:49:06,516
I can't fill myself with so much hate...

388
00:49:07,352 --> 00:49:09,582
Coward that's what you are.

389
00:49:09,787 --> 00:49:11,448
Stop it!

390
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:14,682
I feel suffocated in this house.
It's the same old thing every single day...

391
00:49:26,671 --> 00:49:29,697
Carnivals will be held on our
graves every year,

392
00:49:30,475 --> 00:49:34,468
That's all that will be left of us,
when we die for our country.

393
00:49:34,679 --> 00:49:37,477
Well said Ashfaq Sahab...

394
00:49:37,982 --> 00:49:40,314
If the English could hearyou they
would leave this country in a moment.

395
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:43,813
So what has been decided?

396
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:50,886
We'll steal the Empire's money
from the train that passes Kakori.

397
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,831
And with that money we will buy arms.

398
00:49:54,899 --> 00:49:57,094
Bismil will explain everything.

399
00:49:57,302 --> 00:50:00,066
Yes Bismil... Where is my Ram?

400
00:50:02,907 --> 00:50:05,068
Ljust can't find my
Ramprasad Bismil.

401
00:50:05,276 --> 00:50:06,743
Relax. We will find him.

402
00:50:06,945 --> 00:50:08,537
But where? How?

403
00:50:08,846 --> 00:50:10,905
Very soon. Don't you wo...

404
00:50:13,384 --> 00:50:15,579
You won't get Ramprasad
Bismil out here.

405
00:50:16,821 --> 00:50:18,914
You need a true Indian.

406
00:50:19,857 --> 00:50:21,825
How can you find Indian
revolutionaries amongst...

407
00:50:22,594 --> 00:50:25,222
...people who want to be Westerners?

408
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,863
Ignore him. Let's go.

409
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:30,398
Ramprasad Bismil wished to
be reborn a hundred times...

410
00:50:32,503 --> 00:50:35,700
...so that he could give his life for his
country a hundred times over.

411
00:50:35,907 --> 00:50:37,135
Let's go Sue.

412
00:50:38,376 --> 00:50:42,039
So where do you think
I can find my Bismil?

413
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:48,945
I don't believe this.

414
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:57,084
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

415
00:50:58,296 --> 00:51:03,893
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

416
00:51:04,702 --> 00:51:13,041
Mistake not our silence for submission.
For beneath lies lava, molten.

417
00:51:15,747 --> 00:51:25,213
<i>O Martyre, O men of valour.
One day the enemy will sing your praises.</i>

418
00:51:26,124 --> 00:51:30,356
We will show our mettle
when the moment of truth arrives...

419
00:51:30,561 --> 00:51:35,863
...for courage lives in deeds,
not boastful lies.

420
00:51:36,367 --> 00:51:40,030
We've gathered in the enemy's lair,
my friend...

421
00:51:40,238 --> 00:51:44,106
In the hope of dying for our motherland.

422
00:51:44,308 --> 00:51:48,938
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

423
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:55,450
This day, we walk along with death,
and laugh at its pale spectre.

424
00:51:56,487 --> 00:52:02,653
We will not fearthose cruel swords,
our courage is far sharper.

425
00:52:14,372 --> 00:52:17,239
Sue, this isn't London.
You don't know what kind...

426
00:52:17,442 --> 00:52:18,466
...of scum, men like Laxman Pandey are.

427
00:52:18,676 --> 00:52:22,635
Look Sue if he is a part of this,
then I can't do the film.

428
00:52:22,847 --> 00:52:25,645
If you have any problems
with me say it on my face.

429
00:52:26,117 --> 00:52:30,076
Don't stab me in the back like a coward.

430
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:33,083
Pandey leave!
We don't want trouble...

431
00:52:33,691 --> 00:52:36,091
Speak you coward.
What were you saying?

432
00:52:37,228 --> 00:52:39,958
Aslam, where are you going?

433
00:52:42,633 --> 00:52:43,565
Coward, what were you saying?

434
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:48,227
Hey you! How dare you hit Aslam?

435
00:52:57,448 --> 00:52:58,676
SUKHI

436
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:01,582
Thrash him.

437
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:28,308
I'm sorry,
I took you guys in my film.

438
00:53:29,881 --> 00:53:32,247
God knows what made me come here...

439
00:54:49,594 --> 00:54:52,529
You know we've got a problem
with Pandey. There's a lot of bad blood.

440
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:57,963
<i>And if I stay, it's sure to happen again.
No, Sue.</i>

441
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:59,293
We've worked it out.

442
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,094
You won't have any problems.

443
00:55:07,678 --> 00:55:13,173
Sue... we all know how much
this film means to you.

444
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:18,113
We want to help you finish
what you came here to do.

445
00:55:20,524 --> 00:55:21,889
Everyone wants you to stay.

446
00:55:22,693 --> 00:55:23,887
I want you to stay.

447
00:55:28,666 --> 00:55:33,296
Say something...

448
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:39,069
Don't worry, you're in safe hands.

449
00:55:41,946 --> 00:55:44,107
Come on... Get up... Come here.

450
00:56:00,331 --> 00:56:03,266
She's not going anywhere.

451
00:56:08,139 --> 00:56:09,333
Now just chill.

452
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:56,003
UTv

453
00:58:09,126 --> 00:58:22,631
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air...</i>

454
00:58:22,773 --> 00:58:26,937
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart...</i>

455
00:58:27,144 --> 00:58:33,105
<i>And the zeal, that
races through my blood...</i>

456
00:58:33,484 --> 00:58:37,944
<i>Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

457
00:58:38,155 --> 00:58:42,455
<i>Take all these, and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

458
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:47,120
<i>Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

459
00:58:49,667 --> 00:59:02,979
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

460
00:59:16,026 --> 00:59:17,823
Bismil's sent a message...

461
00:59:18,028 --> 00:59:19,325
...that the Lucknow train...

462
00:59:20,364 --> 00:59:23,822
...carrying the Empire's money...
will be looted by us in Kakori...

463
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:25,828
...while eating Kakori kababs.

464
00:59:26,537 --> 00:59:29,836
And we will buy bombs with that money.

465
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,838
Leave her alone...
She will stop giving milk.

466
00:59:33,043 --> 00:59:36,672
<i>Give colour to your dreams.
And those of your people.</i>

467
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:41,678
<i>Give colour to your happiness.
And your sadness too.</i>

468
00:59:42,052 --> 00:59:46,011
<i>Give colour to generations...
Give colour to the field...</i>

469
00:59:46,724 --> 00:59:49,022
<i>Give colour to the beat of your heart.
And that of your music.</i>

470
00:59:49,226 --> 00:59:51,353
<i>Give colour to every cheek.
Give colour to your eyes...</i>

471
00:59:51,562 --> 00:59:53,689
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism my friend.</i>

472
00:59:53,898 --> 00:59:55,695
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour...</i>

473
00:59:56,734 --> 01:00:05,301
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air...</i>

474
01:00:05,543 --> 01:00:10,037
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.</i>

475
01:00:10,247 --> 01:00:16,049
<i>And the zeal, that races
through my blood.</i>

476
01:00:16,587 --> 01:00:20,887
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

477
01:00:21,258 --> 01:00:25,388
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

478
01:00:25,596 --> 01:00:28,224
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

479
01:00:28,432 --> 01:00:30,059
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

480
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:36,137
Hey Short-stuff!

481
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:37,906
Did you get Bismil's message?

482
01:00:38,108 --> 01:00:39,405
<i>No.
No! Then Listen...</i>

483
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:42,909
The train that's Kakori...
will be looted in eight days.

484
01:00:43,614 --> 01:00:45,241
It's loaded with the Empire's money.

485
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:46,916
Will you loot it?
No.

486
01:00:47,117 --> 01:00:49,244
We will be buying arms from it.

487
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:51,254
<i>What will we buy?
Arms...</i>

488
01:00:51,455 --> 01:00:52,752
Yes... Very Good... go now.

489
01:00:53,123 --> 01:00:57,082
<i>On a slow fire, won't you,
put this passion to cook.</i>

490
01:00:57,528 --> 01:01:02,090
<i>Then as it simmers,
add a babbling brook.</i>

491
01:01:02,333 --> 01:01:07,930
<i>Add a river, and an ocean.
Maybe a pot of water.</i>

492
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:11,596
<i>Then sprinkle a bit. Stir it all up.
And watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

493
01:01:11,809 --> 01:01:16,269
<i>Watch as it brings out
the colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

494
01:01:17,982 --> 01:01:19,279
Bismil has sent a message...

495
01:01:20,317 --> 01:01:21,784
...the Lucknow train...

496
01:01:21,986 --> 01:01:23,613
...which carries the Empire's money...

497
01:01:23,988 --> 01:01:26,456
...will be looted by us in
seven days, in Kakori...

498
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,458
And we will buy bombs with that money.

499
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:33,527
<i>Now paint the whole town with it.
Paint your very being.</i>

500
01:01:34,164 --> 01:01:38,123
<i>Paint your every vein with it.
Paint it with a smile.</i>

501
01:01:38,836 --> 01:01:42,795
<i>Paint those childhood years, won't you.
Paint the flush of youth.</i>

502
01:01:43,507 --> 01:01:47,967
<i>Don't hesitate, my friend.
Paint your patriotism over everything.</i>

503
01:01:48,178 --> 01:01:52,478
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

504
01:01:53,183 --> 01:01:57,483
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.</i>

505
01:01:57,855 --> 01:02:06,456
<i>Take some soil of my land,
the scent of this air.</i>

506
01:02:06,563 --> 01:02:11,296
<i>Add the breath of my being,
the throbbing of my heart.</i>

507
01:02:11,702 --> 01:02:17,163
<i>And the zeal,
that races through my blood.</i>

508
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:22,008
<i>Take all these and stir it.
Then watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

509
01:02:22,379 --> 01:02:26,839
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

510
01:02:29,386 --> 01:02:42,197
<i>Watch as it brings out the colour.</i>

511
01:03:16,266 --> 01:03:23,900
<i>Watch as it brings out the
colour of patriotism, my friend.</i>

512
01:03:55,739 --> 01:03:57,639
British Officers...
around 20 to 25 of them.

513
01:03:58,509 --> 01:04:01,808
We have to call it off! We've nearly
reached Kakori. Stop Ashfaq, quick.

514
01:04:10,687 --> 01:04:11,654
Ashfaq, stop!

515
01:04:14,691 --> 01:04:16,488
It's too late to back out now...
Come on... Move!

516
01:04:34,044 --> 01:04:34,669
Get inside!

517
01:04:49,026 --> 01:04:50,755
Keep the windows shut...

518
01:04:53,230 --> 01:04:53,855
Come on!

519
01:04:55,065 --> 01:04:55,531
The keys!

520
01:04:56,066 --> 01:04:57,363
You won't get away with this.

521
01:04:57,801 --> 01:05:00,361
<i>Give me the keys!
- I don't have it.</i>

522
01:05:00,904 --> 01:05:02,371
Banwari get the sledge hammer.

523
01:05:06,810 --> 01:05:08,539
I'll handle them.
You go get the money...

524
01:07:27,718 --> 01:07:30,186
I've committed my life
to the freedom of this country.

525
01:07:31,555 --> 01:07:35,855
Comfort, and other worldly
desires do not attract me.

526
01:07:37,060 --> 01:07:40,860
I know you want me to
get married and settle down...

527
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:43,358
...like all parents do.

528
01:07:43,734 --> 01:07:45,702
But freedom is my bride.

529
01:07:47,738 --> 01:07:53,199
I hope you'll forgive me.
Your most obedient son, Bhagat.

530
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:00,208
Let's take a break.

531
01:08:05,255 --> 01:08:08,554
Breakfast?
No...

532
01:08:28,945 --> 01:08:29,570
Put it there.

533
01:08:29,780 --> 01:08:34,911
General Dyer? How can one even think
of doing something like this?

534
01:08:37,788 --> 01:08:42,248
I can't believe that he actually killed more
than 400 people at Jallianwala Baugh.

535
01:08:42,459 --> 01:08:44,757
379... that was the official figure.

536
01:08:45,462 --> 01:08:47,760
Actually nearly 1000
people were butchered...

537
01:08:55,472 --> 01:09:01,274
Last year at the tomb of Peer Sai,
I prayed for Daljeet's well being.

538
01:09:01,812 --> 01:09:02,938
Who's Daljeet?

539
01:09:03,146 --> 01:09:05,273
We were the epitome of tolerance.

540
01:09:06,483 --> 01:09:11,284
Even an ant reacts. But we are conditioned
to take everything lying down.

541
01:09:12,055 --> 01:09:14,785
Rubbish! It's today's generation
which lacks the will to do anything

542
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:16,618
Have you ever heard of
Shaheed Uddham Singh?

543
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:20,789
He went all the way to London
and killed that Dyer.

544
01:09:21,331 --> 01:09:24,300
...because he was also a part
of the Jallianwala Baugh massacre.

545
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:28,464
Eat it Sonia.
The butter will strengthen your bones.

546
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:32,798
In Punjab every mother sends
at least one son to the army.

547
01:09:33,009 --> 01:09:35,978
Why should we retreat?
Sacrifice runs in our blood.

548
01:09:36,179 --> 01:09:38,977
Only idiots like DJ retreat.

549
01:09:39,182 --> 01:09:40,809
Why does it always come back to me?

550
01:09:41,017 --> 01:09:43,815
Shut up and eat your paratha.

551
01:09:44,087 --> 01:09:46,647
What is the most used word in this country?
ADJUST!

552
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:51,650
Six people sitting on a seat forfour... someone
will squeeze in and say - 'Please adjust! '.

553
01:09:55,532 --> 01:10:02,665
Hey! Why are you adjusting?

554
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:07,840
Strange. Isn't it?

555
01:10:09,713 --> 01:10:15,174
We are being hunted like
animals in our own country...

556
01:10:18,054 --> 01:10:20,852
...Ashfaq you should cross the border
and get to Afghanistan...

557
01:10:21,892 --> 01:10:25,350
...We have many Muslim friends there.
You will be safe with them.

558
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:27,363
After all, you're one of their own.

559
01:10:27,898 --> 01:10:29,695
One of their own?
Hmm...

560
01:10:30,567 --> 01:10:31,693
Why don't you think of me
as one of your own?

561
01:10:35,906 --> 01:10:37,032
Ashfaq... I never meant...

562
01:10:39,075 --> 01:10:39,700
...Ashfaq...

563
01:10:43,246 --> 01:10:45,373
I didn't mean to hurt you.

564
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:49,385
This is your country as much as it is mine.

565
01:10:50,420 --> 01:10:54,220
You have a right to fight and die for it too...

566
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:57,555
...Forgive me.

567
01:10:57,761 --> 01:10:59,388
Ram, let us not talk of dying...

568
01:10:59,763 --> 01:11:05,065
I pray, that we all live to see
our grandchildren grow up in a free country.

569
01:11:09,606 --> 01:11:10,732
Ram run!

570
01:12:26,349 --> 01:12:28,146
Where are your otherfriends?

571
01:12:29,019 --> 01:12:30,486
Where's Azad?

572
01:13:19,903 --> 01:13:20,699
Banwari!

573
01:14:33,943 --> 01:14:36,275
I loved those songs and dances.
Do they happen in yourfilms?

574
01:14:36,646 --> 01:14:40,173
That's the reason we grow trees
in this country... to dance around them.

575
01:14:45,288 --> 01:14:47,756
So where are we going?

576
01:14:50,627 --> 01:14:53,255
<i>Special day, special place!
Special DAY?</i>

577
01:16:09,038 --> 01:16:12,997
Ever since I was a kid
I used to come here...

578
01:16:14,244 --> 01:16:19,011
...to watch planes take off... and watch them
till they don't disappear in the sky.

579
01:16:23,219 --> 01:16:25,187
What the hell are they doing?

580
01:16:51,748 --> 01:16:53,010
I don't believe them.

581
01:16:53,149 --> 01:16:53,706
Men!

582
01:16:54,250 --> 01:16:56,548
Come on, face it,
you'd love to do that really.

583
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:59,017
What? Take my shirt off
and howl at planes.

584
01:16:59,255 --> 01:17:01,052
I won't mind if you do.

585
01:17:01,591 --> 01:17:03,218
Dream on buddy...

586
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:15,067
Boys and girls
and Sukhi...

587
01:17:15,271 --> 01:17:16,397
Why me all the time?

588
01:17:16,639 --> 01:17:18,072
I want to make a special announcement...

589
01:17:19,609 --> 01:17:23,568
I was wondering if you'd like
to spend the rest of your life with me...

590
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:28,406
...that's in case you aren't
doing anything important...

591
01:17:32,522 --> 01:17:34,080
Will you please marry me?

592
01:17:54,811 --> 01:18:04,777
UTv
