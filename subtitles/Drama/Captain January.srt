1
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,266
Shh!

2
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,718
I've got an errand for
you in the village.

3
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,028
Have Slocum send me a
crate of brass polish.

4
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:00,846
Aye, aye, Captain.

5
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,682
<i>My mother was beautiful,
wasn't she, Cap?</i>

6
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:09,191
Mighty pretty, Star,
accordin' to her pictures.

7
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:11,626
Gee, we were lucky, weren't we?

8
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,959
- Lucky?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:04:14,053 --> 00:04:19,435
I'd never have known what my mother
looked like if it wasn't for that trunk.

10
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,801
Did you swim with it
in your teeth too?

11
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:26,639
No. No, it just washed ashore.

12
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,813
<i>"Lucia Di Lammermoor.”</i>

13
00:04:34,907 --> 00:04:37,649
Do you think they named
the song after my mother?

14
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,224
I reckon so.
She must have been an opera singer...

15
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,123
from the dress she's got on
and the clothes in the trunk.

16
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,058
I wonder.
Could she sing “Asleep in the Deep“...

17
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:50,156
all ways down?

18
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,897
Pretty deep down
in the hatch for a “sopranny?

19
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,753
How can anybody sleep
in the deep anyways?

20
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:16,119
That means the last,
long sleep, Star.

21
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:22,224
- Does everyone have to die?
- Mmm. Sometime.

22
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:26,896
- You and me too?
- When the time comes.

23
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,371
Do you think we'll last till Christmas?

24
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,840
I shouldn't be surprised if we made it.

25
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:34,263
You better up anchor
now and get on your way.

26
00:05:34,288 --> 00:05:35,288
Aye, aye.

27
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:46,183
- Am I seagoin', Cap?
- Seagoin' from jib to taffrail.

28
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:48,259
- Good-bye.
- So long.

29
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,102
Step on a crack.
You break your mother's back.

30
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:09,640
- He's a humdinger.
- Yes, sir.

31
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,322
- Here comes Star. - Hello, Star.
- Howdy.

32
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,724
Come on, Star.
We've been waitin' for ya.

33
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:27,423
Can't now, Paul. I'm on government duty.
Get me tomorrow.

34
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,932
Got a job yet, sailor?

35
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,060
No, but I've been promised one
as soon as the halibut start runnin'.

36
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,766
I hope they start running soon.

37
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,241
Well, you can't rush a halibut.

38
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:43,144
Well, don't give up the ship.

39
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,307
Hello, Star. How are ya?

40
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,976
- How are ya, lassie?
- I am hearty.

41
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:52,420
<i>- Why good morning, Star.</i>
- Good <i>morning,</i> Mrs. Croft.

42
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:55,459
- Is the captain with you?
- No, ma'am.

43
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:59,519
Tell the dear captain
I asked after him. Don't forget.

44
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,826
I will.

45
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:04,527
I mean, I won't.

46
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,763
Well!

47
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:11,501
Better look out, Star, or she'll tie a tow
rope onto January, and you'll lose him.

48
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,009
Not while I'm in charge
of the lighthouse.

49
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,378
We need another case of brass polish.
We need it right away.

50
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:21,213
And don't forget what we get off
for being government.

51
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,777
Well, you know, we always aim
to please you, Miss January.

52
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,790
<i>The price is still the same,
and we'll make prompt delivery.</i>

53
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,929
<i>Hmm.</i>

54
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,658
Have one on the house, Star.

55
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,735
Oh, they're all the same size.
I measured them.

56
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:41,897
I know, but the black ones last longer.

57
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,996
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

58
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:46,599
Now don't forget about
our special price.

59
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,408
- You know I'm giving you all our trade.
- I-I won't forget.

60
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:57,019
There's your music, Star. Let's get goin'.

61
00:07:57,109 --> 00:07:59,555
Come on, Star.

62
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,956
- Don't drop it.
- I won't, Star. - Up here.

63
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,838
Sure can dance, can't she?

64
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:18,134
Well, Star, you can sing about bein'
a sailor, and you can dance like one...

65
00:12:18,204 --> 00:12:21,048
but you'll never be one till you learn
to spit a curve in the wind.

66
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,883
Do you have to know how to do that?

67
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:29,289
You sure do. You're just
a bloomin' landlubber till you can.

68
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,361
Then I'm gonna learn now.

69
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:33,452
Watch me.
Stand back, boys.

70
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,463
Let her go, Cap.

71
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,768
Now it's your turn.

72
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,033
Yeah, go ahead, Star.

73
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:53,175
No, no. That ain't it.
Now, watch me closely.

74
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,613
- Get the idea?
- I got it now.

75
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,622
Watch.

76
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,693
Now you got it.
Try it again.

77
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,704
Who is that child?

78
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,797
She's the adopted daughter
of Captain January-

79
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,070
<i>the lighthouse keeper.</i>

80
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:23,340
- I-Isn't she a pretty little thing?
- Does she go to school?

81
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:27,941
Well, no. You see, the former
truant officer wasn't very strict and-

82
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,748
Yes, I know. That's why
she's the former truant officer.

83
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,743
You school teachers will
find me strict enough.

84
00:13:35,414 --> 00:13:38,452
One, two, three-

85
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:42,522
Little girl! Little girl, stop that!
Disreputable loafers!

86
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,830
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,
teaching a child to behave this way.

87
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:50,396
Don't be mad at them.
They always have fun with me like this.

88
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:55,206
Do you know that Captain Juras
can spit 15 feet in a 20-mile gale?

89
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,976
Indeed!

90
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:02,348
And the skipper-
he's the one with the accordion-

91
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:05,251
once he killed three Chinamen
with a table knife.

92
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:09,224
- - This is dreadful.
You should be taken home and spanked.

93
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,228
What kind of man is this Captain January
to allow you to run-

94
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:15,197
Cap's the finest man
in the whole world.

95
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:18,697
See that lighthouse down there?
Well, Cap owns it.

96
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:21,262
He saved a million
ships in his day.

97
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,758
Go right home and tell him I'm
coming to have a talk about you.

98
00:14:24,783 --> 00:14:25,925
Yes, ma'am.

99
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:30,413
I'll bet she can't spit
a curve in the wind.

100
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:34,109
- Don't be impudent, young lady!
- I didn't mean to be.

101
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:37,016
Cap always tells me
to be polite to old ladies.

102
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,687
- What's her name?
- I'll tell you all about her tonight.

103
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:48,839
Who is she, Paul?

104
00:14:48,864 --> 00:14:52,422
New truant officer they
sent over from Salem.

105
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:55,961
- What's a truant officer?
- Stormy weather for kids.

106
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,270
Then I guess I'd better up anchor!

107
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,477
So long! Bye, Star!

108
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,640
- Good-bye!
- So long, Star!

109
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:13,221
- What did the woman say then?
- She just got mad with me and went away.

110
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,588
Ah, forget about it.

111
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:18,821
She can't do anything
mean to us, can she?

112
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,829
Nah.

113
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,096
Remember, I work for the government.
I am the government here.

114
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:27,568
Maybe she's government too.

115
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,073
I heard Captain Juras say
she was some kinda officer.

116
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:35,168
Well, don't worry.

117
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,077
<i>Havin' trouble, Cap?</i>

118
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:40,650
- <i>Can</i> I <i>look now, Cap?</i>
- <i>Oh, no, no, no, no.</i>

119
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,050
Not yet. Uh, <i>I'll</i> have her
in trim in a minute.

120
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,284
Why do I have to work on this?

121
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,021
<i>All nice little girls
work on samplers.</i>

122
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:55,860
Don't seem like nothin'
I'll need in a seafarin' life.

123
00:15:55,955 --> 00:16:00,370
That's where you're wrong, Star. A good
sailor's gotta be able to steer a needle.

124
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:05,374
<i>Can I look now?</i>

125
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,135
Oh, it's Captain Nazro.

126
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,613
- Hello, honey.
- Well, blind my eyes.

127
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,879
Can't I even give a birthday party
around here without you bargin' in?

128
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,149
Pipe down, you catawampus.
I didn't come to see you.

129
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:22,191
Come on out, honey,
and see the present I brung ya.

130
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,798
Oh!

131
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:36,228
- Remember me?
- Why should the crane remember you?

132
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,304
Is it a crane?
I thought it was the stork.

133
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:45,013
No. It's a crane-

134
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,084
something you always wanted.

135
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,847
Wait. You ain't seen
nothin' yet, Star. Watch.

136
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:23,086
Nice work, Ichabod.

137
00:17:23,175 --> 00:17:26,384
Look at 'em.
Look at 'em.

138
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:30,016
- If it wasn't for the ribbon, you
couldn't tell 'em apart. -

139
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:33,892
You're gonna invite Captain Nazro
to stay for the party, aren't you?

140
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:37,332
- Well, I wasn't countin' on it,
but as long as he's here...

141
00:17:37,357 --> 00:17:39,221
Goody! I'll fix a place for him.

142
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:45,031
Whether you was counting on it or not,
I'm here, and I'm gonna stay for a while.

143
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,110
- Oh, you are, are ya?
- Yes, I are.

144
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,146
It's time I was doin' a little inspecting
around this here lighthouse.

145
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,648
They must be daft in Washington,
appointin' you an inspector.

146
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,583
You don't know the difference
between a telescope and a tar barrel.

147
00:17:56,675 --> 00:17:59,212
The way you handle 'em,
I guess there ain't any.

148
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:07,193
Come and get it, sailors.
Over there, Captain Nazro.

149
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,072
This don't dance around
when you play a harmonica...

150
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:24,738
and it may not be
what you always wanted...

151
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:27,340
but I thought maybe
you'd like it a little.

152
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:30,851
Like it, Cap?

153
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:35,153
It's the most tremendous
present I ever got.

154
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:38,285
Thanks, Cap.

155
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:41,626
- What is that?
- What do you think it is?

156
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,700
How many guesses do I get?

157
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:46,599
It's a cake.
Cap made it himself.

158
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:50,265
Oh, did he?
Then I guess I'll just eat the candles.

159
00:18:53,398 --> 00:18:57,744
Go on, Star. Make a wish and catch
her amidships with a spankin' breeze.

160
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:05,152
- You can have my wish.
- I can?

161
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,104
- Then I wish...

162
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,684
If you wish what I think you're going
to wish, <i>I'll</i> push your face in.

163
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,126
- Why you-
- I'm taking my wish back.

164
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:16,063
I only gave it away because last year
I couldn't blow out all the candles anyway.

165
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,227
All right, matey.
Blow!

166
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,773
What ya gonna call the doll?

167
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,170
Mother.

168
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:35,218
But if it was only an ordinary doll,
I'd call it Susie.

169
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,811
- Why Susie?
- After the captain's mermaid.

170
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,723
What? Has he got a mermaid?

171
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:44,816
Show him, Cap.
Show him!

172
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,989
- No. Go on. Eat your ice cream.
- Please show him.

173
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,260
- Please.
- Oh, all right.

174
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,969
Make Susie dance.

175
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,809
<i>Faster! Faster!</i>

176
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,343
Huh! just a minute.

177
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:10,113
That ain't nothin'.
Take a look at <i>this.</i>

178
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,954
- Can you make him dance?
- Dance?

179
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,049
Pipe down.

180
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:20,289
Do you think that's anything?

181
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,922
Huh! Stay out until
you get something.

182
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:30,135
Well, top that.

183
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,870
<i>It's a pleasure.</i>

184
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,748
What else you got?

185
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,880
Wait a minute.
<i>I'll</i> show you somethin'.

186
00:20:53,018 --> 00:20:55,123
That's stormy weather.

187
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,662
Which one of you
is Captain January?

188
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,808
I'm Captain January.

189
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:07,467
I'm Mrs. Morgan,
the new truant officer here.

190
00:21:07,566 --> 00:21:11,673
- Why isn't this child in school?
- Well, I was aimin' to send her next year.

191
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,943
What you were aiming to do
is of no importance.

192
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:17,748
There's a compulsory education law in
this state, and this child is old enough.

193
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:20,187
How does she know how old I am...

194
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,192
when we don't even know ourselves?

195
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:27,094
From what I have observed, this child is
being brought up entirely without control.

196
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:31,133
She's rude, disrespectful-being raised
like an ignorant little heathen.

197
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,829
Look at the kind of clothes she wears-
not even a dress.

198
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,337
Say, what business is that of yours?

199
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,432
- Star's mine, and I ain't listenin' to no-
- You will listen to me.

200
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:41,078
You forget this
child is adopted.

201
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:43,469
It's within the power of
the school authorities...

202
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:47,210
<i>to have her taken from you and sent to an
institution if you fail to raise her properly.</i>

203
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,685
Just a minute, Mrs. Morgan. Now I don't
hold none with this mildewed old pirate...

204
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:54,622
but you're talkin' through your crow's nest
when you say Star is being brought up ignorant.

205
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:58,525
Why, she can read writing and write down reading
better than any six-year-old on this coast.

206
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,857
What do ya mean, any six-year-old? Well,
there ain't no eight nor nine-year-old...

207
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:04,231
from here to Newfoundland
that knows as much as Star.

208
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:07,563
No! Nor any 10 or 11-year-old
as far as that goes.

209
00:22:07,588 --> 00:22:08,921
Or a 13 or a 14!

210
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:10,083
You talk about neglect.

211
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:13,091
Why I've been learnin' her from
the two best books there is;

212
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,635
- the Bible and Bowditch.
- Bowditch-a book on navigation.

213
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:19,011
Fine reading for a child of six.

214
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,482
Any objections to the Bible?

215
00:22:21,573 --> 00:22:24,554
There ain't better readin' in the world
than the Bible and Bowditch.

216
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:27,021
They both learn ya
to steer a straight course.

217
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:29,820
I didn't come here
to discuss reading matter.

218
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,987
Is she talking about
taking me away from you?

219
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,156
Yes, but just talkin'.

220
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:38,826
Have her report to the schoolhouse
for an examination next Tuesday.

221
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:41,495
My nephew is also taking
his examination.

222
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,574
And we'll determine then and there
whether or not she's been neglected.

223
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,234
There seems to be some doubt
as to the child's age...

224
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:50,211
but you say she has the intelligence
of a child of eight.

225
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,909
- Very well. We'll call her eight.
- Maybe I'm only six.

226
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,009
I'll stand on eight.
Now you get outta here.

227
00:22:57,109 --> 00:23:01,023
This is her birthday, and examination
or no examination, I've had enough of you.

228
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:03,593
We'll see about that.

229
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:13,867
What was that thing she was
talking about-a “instee“- “instee“-

230
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:16,735
Never mind, honey.
You'll never be in one.

231
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:20,799
Now you run outside and play.
I wanna talk to Nazro.

232
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:25,075
- I'll visit with “Ichybod“ the crane.
- All right, matey.

233
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:29,585
- You certainly are a lubber-puttin' your
foot in it that way. -

234
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,554
What's the idea, insisting
Star's as smart as a girl of eight?

235
00:23:33,645 --> 00:23:38,822
- Well, she is, ain't she?
- Sure, but why make it tough on yourself?

236
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:41,830
Would of been enough for her
to pass a six-year-old examination...

237
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,335
- but you have to insist on eight.
- I ain't afraid.

238
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:49,838
After all,
Star doesn't belong to you, you know.

239
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:54,339
- Doesn't belong to me?
- That's what I said.

240
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:58,609
You just took her without saying anything
to anybody or asking anybody anything.

241
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:02,617
You got no legal right to her.
Ya never even adopted her!

242
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,779
She's more than adopted.
She's part of me.

243
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:10,155
That's all right, but it ain't the law.
When ya fished her outta the water...

244
00:24:10,248 --> 00:24:14,628
you should have turned her over to the authorities
or tried to find out if she had any folks.

245
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,495
- I did try.
- Yes, you did.

246
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:20,126
Well, I tried for a little while.

247
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,138
Couldn't keep on tryin' forever.

248
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:26,539
I didn't wanna lose her.
I wanted to keep her.

249
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,101
Anyway, she has no folks.
They're all dead.

250
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:34,673
Are they? Did you ever look
through this album carefully?

251
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:39,313
“Mrs John Mason, 326 Boylston Street,
Boston, Massachusetts.“

252
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,391
They may be relatives, you know.

253
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,393
Just because they didn't answer
your letter doesn't mean they're dead.

254
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,554
They may have been away...

255
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,131
or you might have forgot
to mail the letter.

256
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,686
What business is that of yours?
Star's mine,

257
00:24:51,711 --> 00:24:54,285
and there ain't nobody
gonna take her from me.

258
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:05,543
- How does this look?
- Looks like a flag at half-mast.

259
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,016
Well, I can't quite make up my mind.

260
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:11,212
<i>That's just the thing for school.</i>

261
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,449
When I was a little girl, I had
one just like it.

262
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:19,217
Are you sure you haven't
got one with polka dots?

263
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:20,348
Hmm, let me see.

264
00:25:20,418 --> 00:25:23,228
Polka dots, polka dots.

265
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,029
4.50.
How 'bout this one?

266
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:30,732
There ain't no dots on that.
It's your astigmatism.

267
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,900
Oh, look!

268
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:39,112
Oh, I like this one.

269
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,582
<i>Say, that certainly is a beauty.</i>

270
00:25:41,673 --> 00:25:46,019
- Aw, I don't think so much of it.
- Why don't you try it on, Star?

271
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:50,617
- Can I try it on?
- Why, certainly. Come. I'll help you.

272
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,766
Nazro...

273
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,062
could you let me
have $50 till payday?

274
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,228
What do you do
with all your money?

275
00:26:01,326 --> 00:26:04,136
I'm puttin' it in a trust fund
for Star.

276
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,302
You just caught me a little short
of ready cash, January...

277
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,471
but I know where
you can get the 50.

278
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,778
- Where?
- The widder Croft will let you have it.

279
00:26:13,872 --> 00:26:16,045
The widder will
let you have anything.

280
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,748
Nah. She might start figurin'
somethin' I don't want her to figure.

281
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:24,418
Aw, belay that. No matter what you do, a
woman's gonna figure what she wants to figure.

282
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:27,963
<i>Isn't this pretty?
How do I look?</i>

283
00:26:28,053 --> 00:26:32,229
- Beautiful.
- I think so too. Don't you, Cap?

284
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:34,463
- Well, I uh-
- It fits her perfectly...

285
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,569
and the whole outfit
only amounts to $41.75.

286
00:26:37,594 --> 00:26:38,998
That settles it.

287
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:43,012
You wait here, Star.
You're gonna see the widder.

288
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,174
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

289
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,684
Now wait a minute.
Don't rush me.

290
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,186
Go on on in.
What ya scared of?

291
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:56,817
- She won't bite ya.
- How do you know she won't? Whew.

292
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,590
I'd rather face a 90-mile hurricane
in a leaky rowboat.

293
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:04,462
Say, why do “widders“
always wanna get married again anyway?

294
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:08,094
Are you going in and
ask her for that $50, or ain't ya?

295
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:13,040
I'll tell ya. Why don't we both
go in and borrow $25 apiece?

296
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:16,635
- Huh?
- All right. I'll do it for Star's sake.

297
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,772
Come on.

298
00:27:20,872 --> 00:27:23,580
<i>Lust a minute.</i>

299
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,113
Hello, Nazro.

300
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:31,626
Why, Captain January!
Come in, come in.

301
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,630
Oh, Captain, you should have let me know
you were coming. Why, I look a mess.

302
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,893
- Well, I, uh-
- Uh, Mrs. Croft...

303
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:41,096
Captain January here has something
very personal to say to you.

304
00:27:41,121 --> 00:27:42,155
Ah.

305
00:27:42,227 --> 00:27:45,572
So <i>I'll</i> just shove off
and leave you two alone.

306
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,470
Dirty, double-crossin',
barnacle-brained, scurvyjudas.

307
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:53,014
Oh.

308
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:06,857
What did you come
to ask me, Jan?

309
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:11,263
Well, uh, I-it ain't
so much for me, as for Star.

310
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,563
- Y-You see-
- Oh, I understand.

311
00:28:13,658 --> 00:28:17,105
The poor little dear
needs a mother's care.

312
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:21,575
There's nothing can take the place
of a mother... except another mother.

313
00:28:21,666 --> 00:28:25,204
Yes. Yes, of course.
No, no! No, I-I mean, no.

314
00:28:25,303 --> 00:28:27,374
Uh, it ain't so easy
for me to ask you.

315
00:28:27,472 --> 00:28:30,453
Ah!
Why, Jan!

316
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:35,457
Great, big, seafaring man like you
scared of little, old me.

317
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:39,257
If you'll only grant me
this one little favor...

318
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,058
- I promise-
- Yes, yes. You'll promise?

319
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:45,862
Lend me $50!

320
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:50,463
I've got to get Star a whole new outfit, so
she'll look nice at her school examination.

321
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,940
Why, certainly, Captain.

322
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:58,140
There's nothing you could ask
I could refuse you.

323
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,479
<i>I'll</i> make out a check for you
right now.

324
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,747
Whew!

325
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,889
- There you are.
- Well, thank you. Thank you.

326
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:18,730
You know, I've quite an account in the
bank-more than enough for one person.

327
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:22,464
Yes, uh, well, good-bye, Eliza.

328
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:26,634
Good-bye, Jan, clear.

329
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,003
Good-bye.

330
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:37,619
Don't you talk to me,
you lyin', crawfishin' river rat!

331
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,781
Did ya get it, Jan, dear?

332
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:43,257
That ain't none of your business.

333
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,385
Yes.

334
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:52,728
“I was. You were. He was.
We were. You were. They were.“

335
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,607
<i>“I</i> was. <i>You were.”</i>

336
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:03,008
That don't sound right. Hmm.

337
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:07,550
Gosh. I wish I'd have gone to school
instead of runnin' away to sea.

338
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:21,696
- I'm just polishin' up a bit.
- But you already polished up this morning.

339
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:25,324
Can't you stop now, Cap, and help me
some more for the 'zamination?

340
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:30,133
Pretty soon, honey. But ships and lives
depend upon this light bein' just so.

341
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:34,005
Suppose that light had been out of order
the night you came. Where would you be now?

342
00:30:34,098 --> 00:30:38,046
- Asleep in the deep.
- That's right.

343
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,208
- Remember the tables I learned ya? Huh?
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:45,516
Well, tell me the two table.

345
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,988
Two times one is two.

346
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,559
Two times two is four.

347
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:53,060
Two times three is six.

348
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:57,065
- Two times four is eight.
- That's right. Go on.

349
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:59,829
- Two times five is 10.
- Uh-huh.

350
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,427
- Remember any of the three table?
- Sure!

351
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,599
Three times one is three.

352
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,371
Three times two is six.

353
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,072
Three times three is nine.

354
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,706
Three times four is 12.

355
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,217
Three times five is 15.

356
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:18,981
Three times six is 18.

357
00:31:21,512 --> 00:31:25,221
- Now we'll do some more geography.
- All right.

358
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:29,355
- Captain Nazro says-
- Nazro, Nazro. Always Nazro.

359
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:32,924
- <i>Did</i> I hear <i>my name mentioned?</i>
- <i>What do you want?</i>

360
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:36,301
Nothing with you, you desiccated
old crawfish, but I thought I'd come...

361
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:40,399
and help get Star ready for the
examination-you being so illiterate.

362
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,718
Me illiterate?

363
00:31:41,743 --> 00:31:45,403
Why, I can spell you down, read you down,
write you down and figure you down.

364
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,835
And I can do it all with my
hands tied behind my back.

365
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,805
No, you couldn't.

366
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:51,410
- You'd need your fingers to count with.
- Yeah?

367
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:55,150
Well, I'll bet you couldn't count over 10
without takin' your shoes off.

368
00:31:57,815 --> 00:32:00,762
Quarreling ain't helpin' Star none
with her examination...

369
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,832
but this might.

370
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,629
You see, I thought it might
help things along...

371
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:08,226
if we knew the questions
they was gonna ask.

372
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:11,000
Gee, this is great.
Where'd you get 'em?

373
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,939
Paul “borried“ the key of the schoolhouse
from the schoolteacher...

374
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,774
and him and me paid it
a little visit.

375
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:22,079
Well, listen, Star. These are the questions
they're gonna ask you tomorrow.

376
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,278
Now, here's the first one:

377
00:32:24,375 --> 00:32:29,950
“What would be the area of a field 87 rods
long and 206 and a half yards wide...

378
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:35,020
and what would it cost
at 22 and a half cents a square foot?“

379
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,827
What's the answer?

380
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,603
How much is a rod?
How many fathoms?

381
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,970
I thought you wouldn't know.
Hmm. I'll figure this out for you later.

382
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:47,168
Now let's see what
the next question is:

383
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:52,044
“Name six animals that live
in very cold countries.“

384
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,640
I know!
Three bears and three seals.

385
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:01,814
No, Star.
They mean six different kind of animals.

386
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:06,555
That would be bears and seals
and walruses and foxes and polar bears-

387
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,089
But you've already used bears.

388
00:33:08,114 --> 00:33:11,181
Well, polar bears are different
kind of bears, ain't they?

389
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:16,728
Gonna act like that, you might just as well
say she-bears, he-bears and baby bears.

390
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:21,470
Now what other kind of animal did I see
when we were on that arctic expedition?

391
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:26,538
- Oh, I remember-a skunk.
- Don't look at me, you sea cow.

392
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,913
That's the wrong answer, Star.

393
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,420
What's the next question?

394
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,491
“Can you prove that heat expands?“

395
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,925
- What does “expand“ mean?
- “Gets bigger.“

396
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,861
Can you prove that heat
makes things bigger?

397
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:47,027
Of course it makes things bigger. The days
are longer in the summer, aren't they?

398
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,605
I guess that's the answer, all right.

399
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:53,366
“Write down
the 'quality of mercy' speech...

400
00:33:53,464 --> 00:33:55,444
<i>from The Merchant of Venice. "</i>

401
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:58,946
Bah! It's a put-up job
of that old hatchet face.

402
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:02,143
No child of eight or 80
could answer that riddle!

403
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,690
It's a mistake.

404
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:12,387
I must have picked up
the wrong paper.

405
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,089
This is a high school examination.

406
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:18,599
I just saw the word “examination“
and thought it was all right.

407
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,636
Bah! You can't even steal proper.

408
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,069
Come on, Star. Let's
get on with our lessons.

409
00:34:24,094 --> 00:34:25,163
More 'rithmetic?

410
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:27,479
No, I guess we've
finished with arithmetic.

411
00:34:27,504 --> 00:34:29,292
Does she know about fractions?

412
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,439
- Sure she does.
- How many halves in a whole, Star?

413
00:34:32,537 --> 00:34:34,949
How big a whole, Captain Nazro?

414
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,485
Every whole would have the same
number of halves, wouldn't it?

415
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,387
But wouldn't a bigger whole
have bigger halves than a little whole?

416
00:34:41,479 --> 00:34:44,892
Sounds reasonable.
Uh, how much does four quarters make-

417
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:48,725
Never mind that. They're not gonna
ask Star anything about fractions.

418
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,822
Now let's go on with
our geography again.

419
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,902
Tell me what
I learned you yesterday.

420
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,596
This is the Atlantic Ocean.
This is the Pacific Ocean.

421
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:01,575
- This is the equator. This is the
North Pole. This... N-Not so fast.

422
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:02,653
Not so fast.

423
00:35:02,678 --> 00:35:05,638
The world goes faster
than that, doesn't it?

424
00:35:05,703 --> 00:35:08,980
A mite.
Now, what's this I'm pointin' to?

425
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:11,485
- China.
- Mm-hmm. What comes from China?

426
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,578
- Tea.
- And what else?

427
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:18,320
Chinamen.

428
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,788
You're goin' at this all wrong, January.

429
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:25,197
Nobody's gonna ask a little girl
like Star anything about China.

430
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,361
How do you know? You never passed
an eight-year-old test, did ya?

431
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,532
- I could've passed one.
- Maybe-when you was full grown.

432
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,375
You know, with me tellin' that Morgan woman
I was teachin' Star from the Bible...

433
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:40,142
they're pretty apt to ask her
some questions about the Bible.

434
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:43,822
Well, there ain't many children
as up in the book as she is.

435
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,041
I know, but-

436
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,181
- What are the four gospels?
- Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.

437
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:52,125
Correct. Now remember the story
I read ya last week about the prodigal son?

438
00:35:52,216 --> 00:35:57,325
Mm-hmm. And the father said,
“Bring out the fatted calf and kill it...

439
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,492
and let us eat and be merry.“

440
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:03,231
That's fine.
But everyone wasn't merry, Star.

441
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,534
There was a brother
and some neighbors.

442
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,270
Now, who was sorry that
the prodigal son came back?

443
00:36:09,433 --> 00:36:11,640
The fatted calf!

444
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,019
Listen, Mary, you can give
Star a break if you want to.

445
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,845
It's impossible, Paul.

446
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:32,698
The examination must be conducted honestly.
You know I love Star as much as you do.

447
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,170
Gee, if I was in your place, I'd lean over
backwards to see that kid pass.

448
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:43,041
I'd like to, but I can't lean either way.
The test has got to be perfectly fair.

449
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:45,114
Remember when I was
in school once.

450
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,345
I missed every question on the examination,
but they promoted me anyhow.

451
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,717
I guess they needed your desk.

452
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:55,950
No, that wasn't it. But I did see
the teacher kissin' the principal.

453
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,620
Even if Star saw me kissing the principal,
I couldn't favor her.

454
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:04,598
Anyhow, Mrs. Morgan is no woman to trifle
with. She'll be watching me like a hawk.

455
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:10,640
I know, honey. I know, but-
oh, gee, I wish you'd give Star a break.

456
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:15,473
I wish you'd give me a break, Paul.

457
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,637
Oh, Mary?

458
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,573
I'll see you tomorrow, Mary.

459
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:31,118
- Here.
- Thanks, Cap.

460
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:33,661
- That's for the teacher.
- Why?

461
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,755
- I think it's a good idea.
- Excellent.

462
00:37:36,854 --> 00:37:41,098
- Well, lots a luck, honey.
- Aren't you coming too?

463
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:45,663
No, but we'll be around.
Now, listen, dear.

464
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,642
You've just got to pass this examination.
You've just got to.

465
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,907
It may mean that they'll try to take you
away from me if you don't.

466
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,328
Now-Now, I don't wanna make
you nervous or anything.

467
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:55,975
He don't wanna make you nervous.

468
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,145
You old fool!

469
00:37:58,242 --> 00:38:01,815
- I'll do my best, Cap.
- Now take it easy, and don't worry.

470
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,358
I'm not worried.

471
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:11,197
- There ain't nothin' to worry about.
- No. Course not.

472
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,574
You can't go in there now!

473
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,351
- I wish she was stronger on fractions.
- Oh, you and your fractions.

474
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:35,049
Come on.
Maybe we can see in the side window.

475
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:50,103
- You clumsy old son of a sea slug!
- Shh!

476
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:54,433
Why can't I go in now?

477
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:58,161
Cause the teacher's putting
the examples on the board.

478
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,482
- What's an example?
- Aw, you don't know nothin'.

479
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:07,488
I'll bet you don't even know
who discovered America.

480
00:39:07,578 --> 00:39:11,082
- Was it a sailor?
- I don't know. Guess so.

481
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,057
- Cap did!
- He didn't do no such thing.

482
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:21,933
Christopher Columbus discovered America.
And I know when he discovered it too.

483
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,337
It was in 1492.

484
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,841
<i>You don't</i> know <i>nothin'.</i>

485
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,606
Are you awful smart?

486
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,114
Sure. That's why I'm takin'
the examination today.

487
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:38,347
My aunt wants me to jump
from the first grade to the third grade.

488
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:42,015
I can jump from the first step
to the third step in the lighthouse.

489
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,593
Oh, it ain't that kind a jumpin'.

490
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:46,753
Come, children.

491
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,554
What's she doin'?

492
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:54,033
Nothing. They ain't started yet.
Quit shakin' this barrel!

493
00:39:56,293 --> 00:39:58,569
<i>We're ready to start now, Mrs. Morgan.</i>

494
00:39:58,662 --> 00:40:01,973
<i>That's fine. The sooner the better for me.</i>

495
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:04,273
<i>I'm sure my nephew is ready.</i>

496
00:40:04,368 --> 00:40:09,317
Uh, Cyril, you sit there,
and Star, you sit beside him.

497
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,490
What's this for?

498
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,821
- No talking, please.
- She's a problem.

499
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,158
Shame, shame, shame, shame,
shame, shame, shame.

500
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,726
We'll begin with arithmetic,
children.

501
00:40:25,823 --> 00:40:29,737
What did I tell ya?
Fractions! Let me up there.

502
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,339
Here are eight fishing schooners.

503
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,969
Those aren't schooners. They're ketches.

504
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,843
You're quite right, Star.
But let's go on.

505
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:44,977
Here are eight boats.
These five sailed away.

506
00:40:45,075 --> 00:40:47,487
Now, Star,
how many boats were left?

507
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:51,788
Why would they left?
Did they foul their anchors or something?

508
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,658
Is she havin' trouble?

509
00:40:54,752 --> 00:40:57,995
- Yes, and it's your fault.
- Who are you waving at?

510
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:06,371
Children raise their hands, Star, when they
know the answer. What is the answer, Cyril?

511
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,705
- Three.
- That's correct, Cyril.

512
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:11,006
Of course there were three.

513
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:15,550
Whew. Maybe she's nervous.
But maybe she'll get goin' good.

514
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,280
Bah! I guess Mrs. Morgan was right.
You ain't fit to look after a child.

515
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:21,686
- Who ain't?
- You ain't. You ain't fit for nothin'.

516
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:25,056
- Star oughta be took away from ya.
- Why, you lopsided old swab-

517
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,322
<i>- "When George'; father found-
- Listen.</i>

518
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:31,491
- “his favorite cherry <i>tree-</i> - Gimme your
hand. Maybe there's room for both of us.

519
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,569
<i>“Chopped down, he was very angry.</i>

520
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:38,538
“So the father said,
'Who chopped down the cherry tree?'

521
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:42,805
“George replied,
'Father, I cannot tell a lie.

522
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:47,042
“'I did it with my little ha-

523
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,208
<i>Ha...</i>

524
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:59,193
- Hatchet. Hatchet.
- Hatchet.'"

525
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,631
Shh! Not so loud.

526
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:09,693
You've both read very well.

527
00:42:09,793 --> 00:42:12,273
Now I want you
to make up a story...

528
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:15,833
about being left alone
to take care of a little brother.

529
00:42:15,933 --> 00:42:19,380
- You first, Cyril.
- But I haven't got a little brother.

530
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:22,508
I know, but make believe
that you have one...

531
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:25,086
and your mother has left you
to take care of him.

532
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:27,815
<i>What happened?</i>

533
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,818
I stayed home
with my little brother.

534
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:36,294
We played games.

535
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,731
We had a good time.

536
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:39,960
Yes?

537
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,367
That's all.

538
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,598
What can you make up, Star?

539
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,608
One night Cap went away...

540
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,872
and left me alone in the lighthouse
with my little brother.

541
00:42:50,968 --> 00:42:53,744
My little brother's name is Jimmy.

542
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:57,114
All of a sudden, the biggest wave
in the world came along.

543
00:42:57,207 --> 00:43:02,213
Jimmy was scared, but I wasn't.
Maybe I was a little scared...

544
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:06,159
but I held Jimmy's hand, and we said
our prayers the way Cap taught us.

545
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,390
<i>Well, the lighthouse-
with me and jimmy in it-</i>

546
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:12,729
<i>floated all the ways
over to China.</i>

547
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:13,984
China.

548
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:17,489
Yeah. They'll probably set
her down for lying so hard.

549
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,064
There were a lot of little
Chinese boys and girls there.

550
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,576
<i>We played games with them.</i>

551
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:27,137
One of the little girls gave me a nice
“kimona“ and give me some pretty toys.

552
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:33,085
We were very happy, till a lot of pirates
came off a ship and stole me and Jimmy.

553
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:38,855
Pretty soon a big storm came up, so Jimmy
and I locked the pirates in the hold.

554
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:42,260
<i>Then we sailed the boat
to darkest Africa.</i>

555
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,197
After that, we were wrecked
off the coast of Finland...

556
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:49,203
but we were picked up by a tramp steamer
on the way to Singapore.

557
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,001
There was a bosun on the boat
who scuttled the ship.

558
00:43:52,096 --> 00:43:55,703
- <i>That will be enough, Star.</i>
<i>- But</i> a <i>whole lot more happened.</i>

559
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,904
I know,
but you've told us enough.

560
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:11,492
But history is hardly a
third-grade subject.

561
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:15,553
I suppose you taught her
all you know about history.

562
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:19,328
- She don't know a thing about history.
- That's what I mean.

563
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:23,633
Very well.
Cyril, who discovered America?

564
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:27,174
Christopher Columbus!

565
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:30,575
That's correct.
When did he discover America?

566
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,410
In, uh-

567
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:41,486
- Yes, Star?
- In 1492!

568
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,320
Very good, Star.

569
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:47,862
I can do other things.
I can sing, and I can dance...

570
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,898
- and I can read a ship's compass,
and I can... Well, not now.

571
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:55,266
Come here, Cyril. Go back to your desks
and write the answers to these problems.

572
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:00,172
- This will finish the examination.
- I don't understand Cyril-

573
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:16,651
Well, what about my nephew?

574
00:45:16,676 --> 00:45:20,081
Cyril is a very bright child, Mrs.
Morgan...

575
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:24,189
but I don't think it would be advisable
for him to skip a grade at this time.

576
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:27,098
Did I pass the 'zamination?

577
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,468
Yes, you did, Star.
You may enter the third grade.

578
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:32,871
Whoopee!

579
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,944
- Hoo! She passed!
- She passed! She passed!

580
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,576
- What happened?
- Y-You passed, honey. You passed!

581
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:48,316
- Oh! This is the most flagrant piece of
favoritism I've ever seen. -

582
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:52,155
I'm sorry, Mrs. Morgan. I tried to be fair.

583
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,593
Goin' to put Star
in an institution, huh?

584
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:59,998
You better put that dumbbell
nephew of yours in one!

585
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:02,092
Come here!

586
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:05,901
If they think they're through with me,
they're very much mistaken.

587
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,413
You village people stick together,
but you forget...

588
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,820
I have my authority from the state board,
and I'll take steps-

589
00:46:24,414 --> 00:46:26,485
Oh, that's too bad.

590
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:28,927
- - All right?
- I'm going to-

591
00:46:29,019 --> 00:46:30,999
Oh, I'm so sorry.

592
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,371
Have some more cider, Nazro.
Yeah.

593
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,877
Pretty good for a fella
that didn't have much book learnin', huh?

594
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,143
What's book learnin'
got to do with cider?

595
00:46:46,168 --> 00:46:47,837
I ain't talkin' about cider.

596
00:46:47,905 --> 00:46:50,058
I'm talkin' about my
educatin' Star so good,

597
00:46:50,083 --> 00:46:51,900
she jumps right into
the third grade.

598
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,013
<i>You</i> educatin' her? Why, you couldn't
get into the third grade yourself.

599
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:57,490
Was the things I learned her
that put her through.

600
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,187
Quit your braggin', gooseneck,
and let's drink to Star.

601
00:47:00,284 --> 00:47:04,357
Ya don't think I'd drink to you,
ya blubber-headed blowfish.

602
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,798
- To Star!
- To Star!

603
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,638
<i>Hmm.</i>

604
00:47:12,729 --> 00:47:15,733
Do you think I look as good
in this dress as my mother did?

605
00:47:15,758 --> 00:47:16,758
I expect so.

606
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:20,145
It's been quite a job
of work cuttin' it down.

607
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:22,308
Well...

608
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:27,583
wouldn't you like for me to live here,
sol could cut 'em all down to fit ya?

609
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:31,490
No. I'd rather grow up
to fit the dresses.

610
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:35,223
Oh. You mean,
you wouldn't like me to live here?

611
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:39,665
Well, I like you, but you see,
I'm the lady of the house...

612
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:42,259
and we couldn't have
two ladies of the house.

613
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,206
Oh. Well, now, you tell Captain January
that I fixed this for ya.

614
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,335
- I'll remember.
- Ah. Here we go.

615
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,414
There.

616
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,816
Too high!

617
00:49:37,874 --> 00:49:41,378
Still too high!

618
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:22,242
Gosh, you look pretty in that.

619
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:24,920
Just like somethin'
out of a picture book.

620
00:50:24,988 --> 00:50:27,059
Did you fix that dress over?

621
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,797
Mrs. Croft helped me a little bit.

622
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,070
I've been lookin' all
over for you, Captain.

623
00:50:38,168 --> 00:50:42,025
I thought maybe this telegram
might be somethin' important.

624
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:43,335
Thanks, bud.

625
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:14,607
- Bad news?
- Nope, just department routine.

626
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:18,311
Oh, is that all. I thought maybe they
was gettin' wise down in Washington...

627
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:21,218
and throwin' you outta your job.

628
00:51:21,311 --> 00:51:25,521
No, not exactly.

629
00:51:35,192 --> 00:51:38,230
<i>What would you like me
to play, Captain Nazro?</i>

630
00:51:38,328 --> 00:51:42,777
Oh, uh, nothing, Star.
Not now. I got some work to do.

631
00:51:42,866 --> 00:51:45,506
Good night, dear.

632
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:50,142
- Good night, you old albatross.
- Good night, Captain Nazro.

633
00:52:41,124 --> 00:52:43,195
I got seven.

634
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:46,570
Fifteen-two, 15-4 and each
a dozen.

635
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:48,904
Well, I've been beatin' you
steady now for 10 years...

636
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:53,243
and it looks like <i>I'll</i> beat you
for the next 10.

637
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:59,048
Evenin', boys. Slocum told me
to drop this here on the way home.

638
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:01,713
Put it on the table over there.

639
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:07,021
I can't figure out what you're
layin' all these supplies in fer.

640
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:10,655
You won't need this much
fer just a week.

641
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:13,892
Automatic.
Automatic!

642
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:18,803
Pretty soon they'll have a machine to do
yer eatin' fer ya and yer chewin' too.

643
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:24,008
Go ahead January.
It's your deal.

644
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,273
What's he gabbin' about?

645
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,279
What's all this “automatic“ stuff?

646
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,580
Why, that new light
they're puttin' in here.

647
00:53:37,948 --> 00:53:41,293
- I couldn't get up the nerve to-
- When does it happen?

648
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,455
The 30th.

649
00:54:11,214 --> 00:54:15,458
Now see what you done?
Ya made me swallow my cud!

650
00:54:15,552 --> 00:54:20,865
I'll make ya swallow your cud,
ya lamebrain!

651
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:25,272
<i>Cap! Oh, Cap!</i>

652
00:54:29,366 --> 00:54:32,939
What's the matter, Cap?
Something wrong?

653
00:54:33,036 --> 00:54:37,485
No. No, nothin' at all, honey.
Nothin' at all.

654
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:41,522
I don't think I could fall asleep
unless you read to me.

655
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:46,351
In you go.

656
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:51,256
Now.

657
00:55:05,735 --> 00:55:09,478
The way you look,
I think I'd better read to you.

658
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:11,848
Here.
Let me have the book.

659
00:55:15,011 --> 00:55:20,552
I like this one,
because it tells just howl feel about you.

660
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:51,497
I can't understand why
I don't get no answer to that letter.

661
00:58:51,594 --> 00:58:53,938
In two days,
January'll be out of a job.

662
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,399
That's what old hatchet
face has been waiting for.

663
00:58:56,424 --> 00:58:57,424
Of course it is.

664
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:59,777
It's a shame January
can't get another job.

665
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,782
He's one of the best navigators
on the whole coast.

666
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,046
Jobs ain't to be had
for the askin' nowadays.

667
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:09,021
Maybe when the halibut
start runnin'-

668
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:11,649
or walkin' or somethin'.

669
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:15,127
Perhaps your letter was lost.
Why don't you send a telegram?

670
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:20,759
That's an idea. Do you think I'm doin'
right in sending for these people?

671
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:21,776
Of course you are.

672
00:59:21,801 --> 00:59:24,351
You never did anything
righter in your life.

673
00:59:24,427 --> 00:59:27,499
I hate to think what January's
gonna say when he finds out.

674
00:59:27,597 --> 00:59:31,977
I know. But if someone doesn't come to take
Star, Mrs. Morgan's going to have her way.

675
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:35,675
<i>The minute she can prove he has
ho "yob and ho means oi support...</i>

676
00:59:35,772 --> 00:59:37,911
she'll get a court order like that.

677
00:59:38,007 --> 00:59:41,511
But I don't know nothin' about these Mason
people, 'cept what I read in the album.

678
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:43,648
Maybe they ain't even related to Star.

679
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:47,159
Whoever they are, they're better
for Star than an institution.

680
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:50,697
Certainly better than any institution
Mrs. Morgan would pick out.

681
00:59:50,787 --> 00:59:53,529
That's right.

682
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,536
And Boylston Street's
a very tony neighborhood in Boston.

683
00:59:56,626 --> 01:00:00,096
Will you phone the telegram
to Salem for me? Here's the address.

684
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:03,473
We'll take care of it right away.
Come on, Paul.

685
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,657
I wish there weren't any
jobs in the whole world.

686
01:00:13,682 --> 01:00:14,876
Why, Star?

687
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,517
You worry about jobs,
and Cap worries about them.

688
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:24,531
He feels even worse than you. He sits in
his chair all day just looking and looking.

689
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:28,728
- Hello, Star. Hello, Paul.
- Hello, Captain.

690
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,212
Havin' a good time?

691
01:00:30,237 --> 01:00:33,958
Not really and truly.
I'm just pretending to.

692
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:39,207
Cap's feeling awful bad about having
to leave the lighthouse. Cheer him up!

693
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,316
- He looks worried too.
- He was born worried.

694
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,629
What do you want?

695
01:00:56,719 --> 01:00:59,063
Aw, come out of it.
They way you're acting...

696
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:03,331
you'd think I was responsible
for putting in those newfangled lights.

697
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:07,306
No, it ain't that.
I'm just plumb worried.

698
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,934
I can't seem to connect
with another job...

699
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:13,207
with all that ruction the Morgan woman's
stirring up about Star.

700
01:01:13,302 --> 01:01:18,945
I think everything's
gonna be all right with Star.

701
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:22,455
I've sent for those people.

702
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,889
People? What people?

703
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:29,452
Those people in that album,
the Masons.

704
01:01:29,552 --> 01:01:31,589
<i>I've asked them to come.</i>

705
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,499
You did that?

706
01:01:35,591 --> 01:01:37,935
You?

707
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:42,134
You and me have a lot of quarrels, but I
always thought deep down you were my friend.

708
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:44,768
- I am your friend.
- My friend!

709
01:01:44,867 --> 01:01:48,610
You help 'em to take Star away from me,
and you call yourself my friend.

710
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,515
Why, you dirty, double-crossin'-
I'll brain you! I'll-

711
01:01:51,607 --> 01:01:54,520
- It's for the best January! Don't you understand?
- I'll-

712
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:58,615
Yeah, I understand. I understand
I've been sold out by a man I trusted.

713
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,559
- You haven't been sold out January.
- I have been!

714
01:02:01,651 --> 01:02:04,689
You're a rotten creep
helpin' 'em to steal Star.

715
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:07,233
I suppose you've been
figurin' this out for a long time.

716
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:11,465
- You being without a job... I remember
you tellin' me at the schoolhouse...

717
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:14,838
that Mrs. Morgan was right,
that I wasn't fit to take care of Star.

718
01:02:14,931 --> 01:02:17,207
- I didn't think you meant it then.
- Oh, January-

719
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:18,887
But now I know you did mean it!

720
01:02:18,912 --> 01:02:21,932
You've been plottin' with 'em
to take Star away from me.

721
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:27,215
If you ever come near me again,
I'll break your lyin' carcass in two! I'll-

722
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,991
Did you cheer him up?

723
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,506
Better check up
on that switch box.

724
01:02:52,835 --> 01:02:57,682
All this stuff around here
should have been junked years ago.

725
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:02,018
I guess you don't know how many ships
Cap saved with this light.

726
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:03,704
What, that old Chinese lantern?

727
01:03:03,729 --> 01:03:06,709
You could do better with a
candle and a box of matches.

728
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:09,320
Come on, come on, boys.
It's getting late.

729
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:13,491
Yes, Star. It is gettin' late.
We better be going.

730
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,211
You get that way sticking around
alone in these lighthouses.

731
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:29,377
Where are we going, Cap?

732
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,782
Mrs. Croft's.

733
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,945
She's nice.

734
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:37,513
You know, Star,
I'm kind of glad we're goin'.

735
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:41,151
I ain't so young anymore, and this climbin'
up and down has been gettin' to my legs.

736
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:46,256
Mine too, and that's why I'm glad we're
gonna live with Mrs. Croft instead of here.

737
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:47,425
Eh?

738
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:50,657
It's nearer the school, and
I won't have to walk so far.

739
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:53,229
Oh, yeah. Huh.

740
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:02,607
Yep, I'm relieved to be
gettin' out of here.

741
01:04:02,705 --> 01:04:05,117
So am I.

742
01:04:05,208 --> 01:04:10,749
I'm tired of looking out here
and seeing nothing but the sea.

743
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:14,488
Nothin' but the sea.

744
01:04:23,826 --> 01:04:26,830
- Quick! It's happened!
- I told you not-

745
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:29,609
- But she's got the paper. She's got the order.
- Order? What order?

746
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,373
Order to produce Star in court.
Come on. You gotta beat it.

747
01:04:32,468 --> 01:04:34,948
Mrs. Morgan's on her way here now
with a deputy from Salem.

748
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,540
- You don't want him to take Star away, do ya?
- I'm not running away!

749
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:40,120
- I'm not afraid to appear in court.
- If they get a hold of Star...

750
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:42,348
you'll lose her as sure as
you're standing there.

751
01:04:42,445 --> 01:04:44,550
- What are they gonna do to me?
- Nothin'.

752
01:04:44,647 --> 01:04:47,719
Don't be stubborn. You can fight later.
In the meantime, take Star and hide.

753
01:04:47,817 --> 01:04:50,491
- Where? I got my boat in the cove.
Paul's aboard waitin' for ya.

754
01:04:50,586 --> 01:04:54,362
Run her out a mile or so
and stay there. Come on!

755
01:04:54,387 --> 01:04:55,821
Come on, Star.

756
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,469
Send the rest of
the things over to Slocum's.

757
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,242
- <i>I'll</i> come out and bring you some food in a little while.
- All right.

758
01:05:08,337 --> 01:05:10,408
<i>Hurry, Star!</i>

759
01:05:13,075 --> 01:05:16,147
Take her, January. Right.

760
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,953
Shove off, Paul!

761
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:36,667
Now everything's gonna
work out all right.

762
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,840
You won't let them take me
away from me, will you?

763
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:47,387
Don't you fret none.
I won't let 'em touch ya.

764
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:50,082
Now you better lie down for a bit.

765
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:07,539
It's not nearly as pretty
as your light.

766
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:12,136
Now don't you worry, honey.
You just close your little eyes and rest.

767
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:16,478
I brung you the things from Slocum's.

768
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,945
Hey, gimme a hand.

769
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,888
- Hello, Star.
- Hello.

770
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:35,334
Now, honey, you'd better go back.-

771
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:40,401
There they are!

772
01:06:42,431 --> 01:06:44,809
What's the matter, Cap?
What's the matter?

773
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:46,971
Nothin', honey, nothin'.

774
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,495
Time for runnin' away is over.

775
01:06:54,520 --> 01:06:56,947
I'm sorry, Cap. They
must have followed me.

776
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,324
<i>- Get your mooring lines ready</i>
<i>- Aye, aye,</i> sir.

777
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:03,260
- Take this line on board.
- Aye, aye, sir.

778
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:06,094
- Get out your stern line.
- Aye, aye, sir.

779
01:07:06,188 --> 01:07:08,259
I'm from the sheriff's office.

780
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:11,770
I have an order to produce that child
before judge Thompson at Salem.

781
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:14,705
- All right. When do you want us?
- Tomorrow afternoon at 3:00.

782
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:17,107
- <i>We'll be</i> there.
<i>- You take that child right no w!</i>

783
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,180
He's trying to sneak her
out of the jurisdiction of the court.

784
01:07:20,269 --> 01:07:22,977
- He ain't doin' nothin' of the sort!
- No?

785
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:26,781
What's he doing on this boat then?
Officer, just a minute please.

786
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:30,847
You're responsible for the custody of the
child. If he gets beyond the 12-mile zone-

787
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:34,416
Maybe you're right.
I can't take any chances.

788
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:38,727
- All right. Come on, bub.
- You let me alone! You let me alone!

789
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:41,995
- I won't go! Let me alone!
- Now, now, quit it! Cut that out!

790
01:07:42,091 --> 01:07:44,867
- <i>Quit that' Cut that out, I tel/ you!</i>
- <i>You keep your</i> hands <i>off her!</i>

791
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:47,270
- Ohh!
- You can't take her away from me!

792
01:07:47,363 --> 01:07:51,607
Hey, stop that!

793
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,382
- Oh, please, Cap. Don't
let them take me away.

794
01:07:54,407 --> 01:07:56,696
- Please, Cap!
- Take her'!

795
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:59,844
Come on, bub.
Come on, bub. Let's go.

796
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:02,422
Take her.

797
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:04,548
- Are you hurt?
- <i>I'll</i> be all right.

798
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:06,703
Go with Star. Don't let
her out of your sight.

799
01:08:06,728 --> 01:08:08,346
Go ahead. <i>I'll</i>
take care of him.

800
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:11,626
- You let me go! Cap, Cap!
- Cast off.

801
01:08:13,522 --> 01:08:15,593
Cap!

802
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,433
I don't wanna leave!
I don't want to!

803
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,508
That's all right, honey.
Don't cry.

804
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:25,204
You let me alone!
I want to stay with Cap!

805
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:28,578
I'll be with you soon.
Be a good girl, honey.

806
01:08:28,671 --> 01:08:32,050
Why are they taking me away from you?
What have I done?

807
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:34,178
Cap! Oh, Cap!

808
01:08:45,888 --> 01:08:47,959
Now take it easy, Star.

809
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,095
You see, you're just being shanghaied
by a lot of pirates.

810
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:56,267
But we'll get you away. Why, you'll be
back with January before you know it.

811
01:08:58,534 --> 01:09:01,242
<i>Captain Nazro!
They've come! They've come!</i>

812
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:05,376
They're up at the house looking for you.
The Masons-Star's Aunt.

813
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:08,580
So, that's who she is-
Star's Aunt.

814
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:11,157
Yes. They got your telegram
and came right away.

815
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:14,820
Oh! How dare you interfere?
This is some kind of a trick.

816
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,556
It's not a trick.
Those folks are Star's relatives.

817
01:09:17,653 --> 01:09:20,813
Well, they can tell it to the judge.
But according to the paper I've got here...

818
01:09:20,856 --> 01:09:23,427
- the child has no relatives.
- They've just been found.

819
01:09:23,526 --> 01:09:25,802
- How providential.
- Listen here.

820
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,172
You've got the authority to take Star away
from January. I ain't denying that.

821
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:32,337
But have you got the authority
to take her away from her relatives?

822
01:09:32,434 --> 01:09:34,675
- No, but how do I know they are her relatives?
- That's easy.

823
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:37,046
Drop in at my quarters
and have a talk with 'em.

824
01:09:37,139 --> 01:09:40,518
It's certainly strange that after
four years relatives suddenly appear.

825
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:43,613
It isn't strange at all.
I've had a long talk with them.

826
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:47,660
Mr. Mason is American consul in Morocco,
and they've just come back from abroad.

827
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:51,425
They're fine people, and they've got all
the proof and identification they need.

828
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:53,830
<i>- Well, I don 't know-</i>
- I <i>suppose you know...</i>

829
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:56,995
that under section three,
paragraph two of the penal code...

830
01:09:57,092 --> 01:10:00,266
you can get into a lot of trouble
takin' a child away from its kin.

831
01:10:00,362 --> 01:10:05,072
I guess there can't be any harm in talking
to those folks. Let's go see them.

832
01:10:07,136 --> 01:10:09,241
On my lap, honey-

833
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:12,270
I don't need that. I've
got to go after Star.

834
01:10:12,295 --> 01:10:14,334
Now, Cap, you take it easy.

835
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:16,419
You might be hurt worse
than you think you are.

836
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:17,472
I don't care.

837
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:18,970
I've got to go after Star.

838
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:21,677
Not now. Nothing can
happen to her tonight.

839
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:26,460
- Remember, Nazro is with her.
- I know, but she needs me.

840
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,731
You'll feel better tomorrow. First thing
in the morning, we'll run the boat in.

841
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:34,968
All right.
But the first thing in the morning.

842
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,485
I'm perfectly satisfied,
but maybe the judge would like-

843
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,149
We'll appear before him
anytime he wishes. Here's my card.

844
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,285
Well, good-bye.
Glad to have been of service.

845
01:10:54,383 --> 01:10:57,387
Do you like the doll, Star?

846
01:10:57,486 --> 01:11:01,059
That's a lovely name, Star.
I think I'll call you that.

847
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:04,365
Your real name is Helen.

848
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,566
She says “Mama“ if you squeeze her.

849
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:11,201
I know, but I like this one better.

850
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,371
She's a wonderful doll.

851
01:11:13,469 --> 01:11:17,281
Oh, we're going to try
to make you very happy, Star.

852
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,013
I'd rather be with Cap.

853
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:24,888
Besides, he needs me.
I always take care of him.

854
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,153
Why, he'd be lost without me.

855
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:30,822
I know. He must be a very,
very fine man.

856
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:35,129
Are you sure we shouldn't
see Captain January before we leave?

857
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:37,966
Not now, ma'am.
I don't think it would be a good idea.

858
01:11:38,060 --> 01:11:42,406
You see, he feels Star is his.
It might cause a lot of trouble.

859
01:11:42,498 --> 01:11:46,503
- Please, I want to see Cap!
- Oh, you do?

860
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:49,879
What do you think we'd better do?
The child feels so badly.

861
01:11:49,972 --> 01:11:53,749
She'll cry and feel bad for a few days,
but after that she'll be all right.

862
01:11:53,842 --> 01:11:56,049
You know children.
They forget quick.

863
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:58,591
Yes, but it's going to be
hard on Captain January.

864
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,924
No doubt of that.

865
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:03,677
But he'll see the right of it when I
tell him the kind of folks you are.

866
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:07,564
Better get it over.

867
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:27,851
Tell Cap-
Tell him that I love him. Tell him.

868
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,890
Oh, come now.

869
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:40,658
Well, I got her away from
that old reprobate anyway.

870
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:45,034
And as for you, young lady, you can rest assured
you'll be dismissed for your part in this.

871
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,937
Ooh! I beg your pardon.

872
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,067
Come on, Mary.

873
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:40,693
Come on.
It's time for your nap.

874
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:44,754
I love you better than
all the other things put together...

875
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:50,769
because you look like my mother, and
the captain made you with his own hands.

876
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:09,979
- - I guess you better get
Star ready. They're coming for her.

877
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:12,746
Thank you, dear.
Come on, Star.

878
01:15:15,377 --> 01:15:18,654
Well, Star, are you ready
for a nice surprise?

879
01:15:18,747 --> 01:15:23,025
- How would you like to take a lovely trip?
- Very much, Aunt Mary.

880
01:15:23,118 --> 01:15:24,213
Go on, dear.

881
01:15:24,238 --> 01:15:27,522
I think we've found a
toy you'll really like.

882
01:15:32,194 --> 01:15:35,471
And besides, we're fixing up
a playroom for you.

883
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:37,635
Thanks, Uncle John.

884
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:41,112
- Would you like to go up on the bridge?
- Yes, please.

885
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:44,207
