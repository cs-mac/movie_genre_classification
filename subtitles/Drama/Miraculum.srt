1
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,595
"Everyone who practices sin

2
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:55,681
is also practicing lawlessness."

3
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:00,812
Alas, the first humans
rebelled against God's authority.

4
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:06,317
By this betrayal
they became sinners.

5
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,404
For thousands of years,

6
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:13,783
Jehovah has let humans
make their own choices.

7
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,619
History

8
00:01:17,662 --> 00:01:19,789
shows they are unable to do so.

9
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,502
Every human government...

10
00:01:30,049 --> 00:01:33,302
Every human government
causes suffering.

11
00:01:33,428 --> 00:01:37,014
None has ever succeeded
in eradicating war,

12
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,644
<i>criminality, injustice or disease.</i>

13
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,443
<i>God is here, and will soon
put an end to all our suffering.</i>

14
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,738
<i>Some might think
that death is unjust.</i>

15
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:56,826
<i>But Jehovah tells us</i>

16
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,829
<i>it is not unjust.</i>

17
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,082
It is normal.

18
00:02:41,746 --> 00:02:44,165
Mrs. Simard? Your keys.

19
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:48,085
Mrs. Simard?

20
00:02:53,925 --> 00:02:56,719
Heard from Etienne?
He fell again.

21
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:58,721
No.

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,349
What's going on?

23
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:05,937
Don't worry.
I'm sure it's nothing.

24
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:27,124
Hello?

25
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,547
I'm fine. It's nothing.

26
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:38,261
Is everything OK?

27
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,137
Sure. I drove his car here.

28
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:44,183
His vision's blurry.
He fell from the ladder, right?

29
00:03:44,308 --> 00:03:46,894
Yes. I'm fine.
I grabbed the drainpipe.

30
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,604
- You're not hurt?
- No!

31
00:03:57,029 --> 00:03:58,364
Hi.

32
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,242
My nurse will treat my scratch.

33
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,286
- What scratch?
- It's nothing.

34
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:04,912
Leave it to me.

35
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:13,379
Michel, some tea?

36
00:04:13,504 --> 00:04:16,299
No, thanks. I should head home.

37
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:18,259
- You OK?
- Yeah. My back hurts.

38
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,942
She keeps suggesting I see a doctor.

39
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,445
I don't want to.

40
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,615
You should tell them.

41
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:42,283
No way.

42
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,285
No, I...

43
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,663
I don't want her to worry.

44
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:53,502
But tomorrow...

45
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:57,757
we'll pretend to go.

46
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,480
I need you.

47
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,526
<i>Help me.</i>

48
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,782
<i>I made your bed downstairs.</i>

49
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,039
You know I love you, right?

50
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,796
Etienne?

51
00:06:19,964 --> 00:06:21,882
- Etienne?
- Yes.

52
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:26,262
The hospital called.
There was a big plane crash.

53
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,556
<i>I'll take your car, OK?</i>

54
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,978
<i>A plane crashed?</i>

55
00:06:34,103 --> 00:06:35,271
<i>Yes.</i>

56
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,733
<i>Were many people killed?</i>

57
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,341
No one?

58
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:08,220
One.

59
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,879
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

60
00:07:51,055 --> 00:07:54,391
- You've been in Venezuela for...?
- Three years.

61
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:57,144
- Why three years?
- What?

62
00:07:57,686 --> 00:07:59,897
What did you do in that time?

63
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,442
Escaped the snow.

64
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:08,697
Do you come back often?

65
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,282
Never.

66
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,409
And you're here for...?

67
00:08:13,118 --> 00:08:14,703
My niece's birthday.

68
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,249
Are you bringing her a gift?

69
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,019
Have a good day.

70
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,522
Welcome home.

71
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:16,158
- Good morning, guys!
- Morning.

72
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,287
So, Henri, have a good night?

73
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,957
I'm down to my last 5 thou.

74
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,042
Today's the day
I begin a new life.

75
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,962
I can't go home.

76
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:33,342
Don't sweat it. You're not dead
till your last cent's gone.

77
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,658
I'm Kim.

78
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:03,497
Christ, it's early.
I haven't had a coffee yet.

79
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,749
First time?

80
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:10,629
So, are you digesting OK?

81
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,818
Who's that? You're supposed to
keep a low profile.

82
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,486
He's my brother.

83
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,196
Shit!

84
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,282
C'mon, let's go.

85
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:50,294
The night wasn't too long?

86
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:53,255
The usual. What about you?

87
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:56,675
I slept in the hotel.
Tonight I fly south.

88
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,427
Yeah? Where to?

89
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,263
Cuba. With my wife.

90
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:05,851
Same hotel, same beach umbrella
for 14 years.

91
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,103
Wow, you're lucky.

92
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:10,230
It'll do her good.

93
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:14,234
Each time we're in a hotel bed,
I dunno...

94
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,153
It's like the first time.

95
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:19,073
For a few days, we're honeymooners.

96
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,161
Ever been to Cuba?

97
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,788
Nope.

98
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,248
Want to go with my wife?

99
00:12:28,791 --> 00:12:30,167
She's still pretty.

100
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,046
Sorry. I'm already taken.

101
00:12:37,174 --> 00:12:39,134
Hi, it's Evelyne.

102
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,721
I just wanted to say hi
before leaving.

103
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,015
We're flying out tonight.

104
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,726
I wanted to know how you are,

105
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,729
how your belly's coming along.

106
00:12:51,772 --> 00:12:56,151
By the way, we meant it
when we offered to be godparents.

107
00:12:56,527 --> 00:12:59,488
I know we don't have any experience.

108
00:12:59,613 --> 00:13:03,408
But still,
I'm pretty sure we'd be good at it.

109
00:13:03,534 --> 00:13:04,576
I know we would.

110
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,954
Anyway, that's not why I...

111
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,831
Why I called.

112
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,458
I just wanted to say hi and that...

113
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:16,171
I'll be thinking of you,
my feet in the sand.

114
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,132
And...

115
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:24,263
That's all.
I just wanted to say hi

116
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,307
and that I'll call
when I get back, OK?

117
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,215
Already?

118
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,010
I'm going back soon.

119
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,888
You can do what you want.

120
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:08,348
Got the money?

121
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,398
After you crap.
I'll come and meet you.

122
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,817
They said I'd get it on arrival.

123
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,444
Who said that?

124
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:24,156
- Ramon.
- He's full of it.

125
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,075
You'll stay on the crapper
till it's out.

126
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:28,619
I got stuff to do.

127
00:14:29,161 --> 00:14:30,537
We good?

128
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:33,832
I'm hungry-

129
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,584
Shit first.

130
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:40,422
It'd be nice if you washed 'em
before I come back.

131
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,231
I'm on my break. You?

132
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:58,941
Everyone can see us.

133
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,489
You get more beautiful every day.

134
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,449
There are cameras all over.

135
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,202
So what?

136
00:15:14,498 --> 00:15:16,041
I'll be waiting.

137
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:33,100
The hotel reception
told me you'd left.

138
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:35,310
Where?

139
00:15:38,272 --> 00:15:40,565
What time's your meeting over?

140
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,486
We have to be at the airport
by 8:45, max.

141
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:49,616
Not much. I had a coffee,

142
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,035
hung out on Facebook.

143
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,039
The beach will be nice, huh?

144
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,960
Yeah.

145
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,629
Yeah, I imagine.

146
00:16:43,128 --> 00:16:45,964
What you did to me
with your fingers...

147
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,554
Took me two months of research
to find it.

148
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:54,222
Tell me about it.

149
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,267
Even I couldn't find it anymore.

150
00:17:00,812 --> 00:17:03,148
Never thought it would happen to me.

151
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,775
What?

152
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,402
Well, this... This here.

153
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,080
Want to go south with me
on vacation?

154
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,582
What?

155
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:27,672
My treat. We leave tonight.

156
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,716
Be serious.

157
00:17:30,801 --> 00:17:33,095
Head south, just like that?

158
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:35,138
Yeah. You...

159
00:17:36,473 --> 00:17:38,517
You go home and pack.

160
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:43,647
Tell him you're leaving.
I'll be waiting outside.

161
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,859
No, Raymond.

162
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,324
I want you, just for me.

163
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,660
Just us two.

164
00:17:57,411 --> 00:17:59,037
Think about it.

165
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,874
The two of us,
our feet in the sand.

166
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:16,221
So, what did the doctor say?

167
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,308
That I have two cracked ribs.
That's all.

168
00:18:20,434 --> 00:18:22,227
It'll heal by itself.

169
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,280
What about your dizzy spells?

170
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,201
He said I work too hard.

171
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:43,206
That I don't drink
enough water and...

172
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,543
But... Don't worry about it.

173
00:18:47,878 --> 00:18:49,671
I'll be fine.

174
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:56,136
I don't want you to worry.
I'm fine.

175
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:57,762
I'm fine.

176
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:01,057
Under Karine Tessier.

177
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:08,148
It's an old cell number.
How can I get her new one?

178
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,735
<i>There's no way?</i>

179
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:16,031
<i>Yeah. Thanks.</i>

180
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,904
- Marc-André?
- Yes.

181
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,031
I'm going to be sick.
For a week.

182
00:19:58,156 --> 00:19:59,699
Get real.

183
00:20:01,034 --> 00:20:03,662
I've never asked
for anything. Please.

184
00:20:03,787 --> 00:20:05,038
Raymond...

185
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,252
Please.

186
00:20:13,672 --> 00:20:15,298
You're not sick.

187
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:18,593
No, but I'm going to be.

188
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,431
If you're not here,
you're fired.

189
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,934
I'm sorry.

190
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,858
Then I'm fired.

191
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:07,267
<i>How's Etienne?</i>

192
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,983
Don't try, it's pointless.

193
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,321
What are you waiting for?

194
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:21,698
A miracle?

195
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,620
We told you.
We can't give or receive blood.

196
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:30,248
Julie, forget your religion
for two seconds.

197
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,000
You don't understand.

198
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,377
Using blood makes you impure.

199
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:35,795
I understand.

200
00:21:36,546 --> 00:21:38,465
He has no white blood cells.

201
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:42,594
The leukemia has destroyed
his immune system.

202
00:21:44,137 --> 00:21:46,264
You're back to transfusions.

203
00:21:47,682 --> 00:21:49,225
We can't.

204
00:21:49,601 --> 00:21:52,103
He has to come in. Right away.

205
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:55,649
Without chemo, he has no chance.

206
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:59,277
We are going to a better world.

207
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:02,656
Death is only a transition.

208
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,033
We return to Paradise on Earth.

209
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:09,120
All I want is to save him.

210
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:14,542
I guarantee that with transfusions,
he'll make it.

211
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,881
What'll happen to him afterward?

212
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,677
After what?

213
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,305
After. You can't guarantee him
a place in heaven.

214
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:31,017
I'm talking about
his life here, now.

215
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,228
For him, it's about eternity.

216
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:42,195
His chances are slim.

217
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,949
You don't understand.

218
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,662
What don't I understand?

219
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:57,085
It's not about chance.

220
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:03,591
Fucking hell!

221
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,428
I hear you.

222
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,642
Only Bed 6 is left.

223
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:18,815
Ten of morphine, burns on 60%...

224
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,359
thoracic bleeding...

225
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,779
I prayed for him all night.

226
00:23:25,822 --> 00:23:27,490
Are you alright?

227
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:29,951
He's the only one we saved.

228
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:33,496
- They were headed on vacation.
- Don't go there.

229
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,626
Why them?

230
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,590
Because man is impure.

231
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,762
Yes, but... Why did he make it?

232
00:23:49,345 --> 00:23:52,307
He was at the right place
at the right time.

233
00:23:53,475 --> 00:23:55,685
We have to work, sweetie.

234
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:00,899
My mom told me.

235
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,152
He fell at work?

236
00:24:06,321 --> 00:24:07,614
But he's OK.

237
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:12,494
I'm almost done.

238
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,420
It'll pull a bit, but I'm done.

239
00:24:28,301 --> 00:24:29,803
There.

240
00:24:44,526 --> 00:24:46,486
This will soothe you.

241
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,166
It'll feel cold.

242
00:25:03,878 --> 00:25:05,338
There.

243
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,931
We'll leave it half an hour.

244
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:18,059
Someone else will remove it.
I'm off.

245
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:21,020
See you tomorrow.

246
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:59,183
THE HOLY SCRIPTURES

247
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,505
What's wrong?

248
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,091
I have a niece.

249
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,137
Karine... Find her.

250
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,556
- Give her the money.
- What?

251
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,642
Say it's for her.

252
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:48,608
You swallowed 60.
That's not 60!

253
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,418
Listen to me, you fuck!

254
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,712
I don't know you, you're nobody.

255
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,881
But you're gonna shit 'em out!

256
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:18,179
Did one burst in you?

257
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:23,017
Christ! You're not gonna die on me?

258
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:25,603
Nathalie, get the cart!

259
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,112
Prepare the defibrillator.

260
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:38,533
He's coding! Call the doctor!

261
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,120
- One of adrenaline.
- Let me do it.

262
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:07,895
Keep I'! UP-

263
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:15,820
Keep going.

264
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,488
He's back!

265
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,491
He's back.

266
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,271
Tonight, I also have
Jamaica, 8:05 p.m.

267
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,399
Cuba, 10145...

268
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,733
Cuba?

269
00:28:56,694 --> 00:28:59,947
Holguin, on the northeast tip.

270
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,034
But it's a two-week minimum.

271
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,163
Do it.

272
00:29:07,622 --> 00:29:09,624
Two weeks... We'll live it up.

273
00:29:09,749 --> 00:29:12,877
You won't regret it.
The hotel's so romantic.

274
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:16,923
The other passenger's name?

275
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:20,259
Why do you need it?

276
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,637
To book her ticket.

277
00:29:24,764 --> 00:29:26,140
Louise...

278
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:29,560
Louise Carpentier. She's gorgeous.

279
00:29:33,147 --> 00:29:36,150
- I've never been on a plane.
- No?

280
00:29:36,776 --> 00:29:38,152
I was always scared.

281
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:42,406
Don't worry. Seriously,
it's safer than driving.

282
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:46,577
I know, but I'm still scared.

283
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:53,543
Nothing's wrong.

284
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:55,336
No, he's fine.

285
00:29:55,795 --> 00:29:58,214
Yeah. Room 509.

286
00:29:58,673 --> 00:29:59,673
Bye.

287
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:03,094
And?

288
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,596
- Won't come out.
- Christ!

289
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,225
And your cramps?

290
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,018
Great.

291
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:22,113
Listen. The exchange
is in another room.

292
00:30:22,238 --> 00:30:23,781
Do as I say.

293
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:28,411
Wait here with the stock.
I'll go see him so he doesn't freak.

294
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:30,997
He'll want his 60 packets.

295
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:34,542
Come down when I call you. Room 509.

296
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:38,129
You hand me the bag,
come back here and wait.

297
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:43,759
What about the money?
Who says you'll show?

298
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,345
Me. I say so.

299
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:55,396
You know I'll pay you back.
What's the problem?

300
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:57,356
It's a whack of cash.

301
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:59,901
Look, when your luck's down,
you lose.

302
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:03,070
You have to hit bottom
to bounce back.

303
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:07,533
It's always like that.
I'm a winner, a winner.

304
00:31:07,658 --> 00:31:09,702
Did I ever not bounce back?

305
00:31:12,914 --> 00:31:14,832
Parking B, 15 minutes.

306
00:31:14,957 --> 00:31:16,375
There!

307
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,742
<i>Why a new bikini?</i>

308
00:33:13,284 --> 00:33:15,911
I must've gained weight. I dunno.

309
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:19,999
- Where's the garage remote?
- <i>I loved</i> the old one.

310
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,086
I told you, I'm here till 6.

311
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,131
Samuel and I are
reviewing our strategy.

312
00:33:28,966 --> 00:33:32,094
<i>I'll check out
and meet you at the airport.</i>

313
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:37,725
<i>You bet. OK, bye.
Gotta go, Samuel's waiting.</i>

314
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,443
100,200, 300, 400, 500.

315
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,532
100,200, 300, 400, 500.

316
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:59,080
OK, keep going.

317
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,250
100,200, 300, 400, 500.

318
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:08,214
- Bonus.
- Thanks!

319
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,758
Some blow?

320
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:13,302
Why not?

321
00:34:19,475 --> 00:34:21,018
What was that?

322
00:34:21,727 --> 00:34:25,981
A loser. Every year,
a few decide not to go home.

323
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:30,111
- I'll put it on your bill?
- What do we do?

324
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:16,282
Crazy day. Late for daycare...

325
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:19,076
How are you?

326
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:23,122
- The man from the plane?
- Good. The bleeding's controlled.

327
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:27,334
Did you know he's O neg like you?
The doctors hate that.

328
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:33,674
You're so pretty!

329
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:38,304
- I love you.
- Me too.

330
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,100
Find your dad.
I think he's in the kitchen.

331
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,519
He had no passport.

332
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:48,606
- They don't know who he is.
- Sister!

333
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,651
I was there.
She wore a beige dress.

334
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:53,986
Yellow!

335
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,739
That's what I said.
Beige, yellow...

336
00:35:56,864 --> 00:35:59,617
- Brother?
- No, I think Michel's right.

337
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:03,662
You weren't there. Wait,
weren't you in Seattle to build...

338
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,415
Are you OK?

339
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,043
- Isn't Etienne here?
- No, he's not.

340
00:36:09,376 --> 00:36:11,670
No, no. You were in Seattle.

341
00:36:31,565 --> 00:36:34,527
Shut it!

342
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,575
So, Sister, when's the big day?

343
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,078
Second week of May.

344
00:36:45,412 --> 00:36:48,249
You know what I told
your father and mother

345
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,084
at least 10 years ago?

346
00:36:50,209 --> 00:36:52,962
- You're not going to start?
- Sure.

347
00:36:53,087 --> 00:36:57,967
I said, "Those two will get hitched
and have a slew of kids."

348
00:36:58,425 --> 00:37:02,012
- Brother, you can't contradict me.
- No, it's true.

349
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:05,599
Etienne, not eating?

350
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,102
No, I'm not hungry. Sorry.

351
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,146
It's her fault, of course.

352
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,066
I stuffed my face
with your muffins.

353
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,568
Again.

354
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:22,533
I bought the color for the hall.
The paint.

355
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:25,035
- It's a nice color, I think.
- Good.

356
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,330
Forgive me.

357
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:32,084
With the crash, I have to go.

358
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:36,130
- You're not working.
- No, I'll just drop by.

359
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,759
No more bets.

360
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,137
Eight.

361
00:37:44,054 --> 00:37:46,724
Twelve. Over.

362
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:49,435
Ten.

363
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:52,938
Sir? You have ten.

364
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,493
Yes?

365
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,625
No, your daddy's...
Your daddy's busy.

366
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:16,253
He went for a walk.

367
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,340
Yes.

368
00:38:20,382 --> 00:38:23,802
OK, yes, I'll tell him to call.

369
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,076
Hi.

370
00:39:17,106 --> 00:39:18,482
Yes?

371
00:39:19,692 --> 00:39:21,568
Where do you think I was?

372
00:39:23,237 --> 00:39:26,156
Sure. Don't freak out, I'm coming.

373
00:39:26,281 --> 00:39:28,242
I know, 509.

374
00:40:04,194 --> 00:40:05,696
Who's that man?

375
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:07,489
I don't know.

376
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,012
This is us.

377
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:36,059
Your bags!

378
00:40:36,435 --> 00:40:38,312
I nearly forgot. Thanks.

379
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,538
- Let me help.
- Thank you.

380
00:40:57,831 --> 00:40:59,625
Thanks. There we go.

381
00:41:00,334 --> 00:41:02,419
Hop, hop, hop!

382
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:07,508
That's OK, I'll...
I'll put them here.

383
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,134
- Police, open up!
- Thanks.

384
00:41:09,259 --> 00:41:12,888
Can I use the toilet?
I forgot my key. Sorry.

385
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,560
We know you're in there!

386
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:28,320
Police! Open the door!

387
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,116
We have a warrant! Open up!

388
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,038
We have the key. Open up!

389
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:42,751
- Look, you...
- Sorry. The pool?

390
00:41:42,876 --> 00:41:44,378
Please, go now.

391
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,046
Leave.Leave.

392
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:47,714
- Yeah, sure.
- Please.

393
00:41:48,465 --> 00:41:50,008
Thank you.

394
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:53,512
I didn't do anything! Let go!

395
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:57,641
Let go! I didn't do anything!
It's not me!

396
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:59,810
I didn't do anything!

397
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,354
Christ, I swear I didn't!
Get off me!

398
00:42:02,479 --> 00:42:05,440
- Who are you?
- Room 504.

399
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:07,484
This way, sir.

400
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:24,209
- What floor's the pool?
- No idea.

401
00:42:30,883 --> 00:42:32,426
Good bye.

402
00:42:51,194 --> 00:42:52,696
Can I help you?

403
00:42:53,155 --> 00:42:55,490
Yes, please. I'd...

404
00:42:56,825 --> 00:42:59,870
- I'm not sure.
- Is it for a bikini?

405
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:05,167
I can show you our one-piece suits.

406
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:11,048
Like to try one?
You have the body for it.

407
00:43:47,584 --> 00:43:48,877
What's on?

408
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:50,963
A dumb quiz show.

409
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,136
- I have something to tell you.
- Look at the guy.

410
00:43:58,887 --> 00:44:01,473
He's gonna lose everything he won.

411
00:44:19,491 --> 00:44:20,993
Madame?

412
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,621
What do you think?

413
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,623
It's no good.

414
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,209
What's the problem?

415
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:36,425
I have a great one-piece in black.
It's slimming.

416
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,635
Do you want to try it on?

417
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:42,889
Shall I get it?

418
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,560
Yes, I'll try it on.

419
00:44:49,938 --> 00:44:51,523
What are you doing?

420
00:44:53,734 --> 00:44:55,402
I'm taking a plane.

421
00:44:58,113 --> 00:44:59,823
You're taking a plane?

422
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,035
Yeah.

423
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,124
<i>I'm taking a plane.</i>

424
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,509
Madame, do you need any help?

425
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:25,891
What are you doing in there?

426
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:31,396
<i>I'll need the booth.
I don't understand.</i>

427
00:45:33,523 --> 00:45:34,733
<i>Are you alright?</i>

428
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,157
Madame?

429
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:44,951
Just leave me alone, OK?

430
00:45:45,077 --> 00:45:47,037
Madame, you have to come out.

431
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:16,733
How are you?

432
00:46:22,364 --> 00:46:26,576
This is my son,
8 months, 2 weeks.

433
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:32,165
Jonathan, this is Julie,
my best friend.

434
00:46:42,884 --> 00:46:45,762
<i>I found a job at Dony's,
the restaurant.</i>

435
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:57,482
I want you to know...

436
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,528
I had to leave.

437
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:06,032
You know I love Alexandre.

438
00:47:09,286 --> 00:47:10,954
This is my stop.

439
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:13,123
Tell my dad I miss him.

440
00:47:16,751 --> 00:47:18,378
Mr. Thibault?

441
00:47:19,129 --> 00:47:20,881
I saw Mélanie on the bus.

442
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,509
She's doing well.

443
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:38,148
Good for her.

444
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,697
Your grandson's name is Jonathan.

445
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:55,248
Yes?

446
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,509
Why did you bring that up?

447
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:17,854
Etienne can't work
with you tomorrow.

448
00:48:28,073 --> 00:48:29,783
What Will he do?

449
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:31,785
Nothing.

450
00:48:33,161 --> 00:48:34,746
He'll do nothing.

451
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,458
He should go to the hospital.

452
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:41,086
He'll be disfellowshipped.

453
00:48:41,628 --> 00:48:44,881
Even if he changes cities,
countries...

454
00:48:46,466 --> 00:48:48,969
The whole congregation will know.

455
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:55,183
You love him very much.

456
00:48:57,477 --> 00:48:59,020
But tell yourself that

457
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:02,023
Jehovah loves us just as much.

458
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,235
He watches over us.

459
00:49:07,612 --> 00:49:09,781
He left us His Word.

460
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:12,534
It can go fast.

461
00:49:13,952 --> 00:49:17,205
- He'll catch a virus.
- We must abstain from blood.

462
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,332
- Dad!
- He has no choice.

463
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,042
He has no choice.

464
00:49:22,294 --> 00:49:24,045
Etienne knows that.

465
00:49:28,008 --> 00:49:29,843
We have to keep the faith.

466
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:34,889
All we can do is
believe in His Word.

467
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,353
Get some sleep.

468
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,857
You need your strength.

469
00:49:45,442 --> 00:49:46,985
Hello?

470
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:49,487
Sorry to bother you, but...

471
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:54,200
I'm at the pharmacy.
I wanted to know what to buy.

472
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:57,579
Should I get some 30 or 45?

473
00:49:57,704 --> 00:49:59,497
<i>What do you prefer?</i>

474
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:01,666
Some 15.

475
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:06,671
The 15 is shit. It's useless.

476
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:10,425
You've been drinking, huh?

477
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:11,968
You've been drinking.

478
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:15,597
I'm not well.

479
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:21,227
<i>Now I have to start all over.</i>

480
00:50:21,353 --> 00:50:24,022
We're on vacation.
You'll stop after.

481
00:50:24,147 --> 00:50:27,233
I can't talk.
I have to wrap up my meeting.

482
00:51:41,099 --> 00:51:43,226
Fuck, Why'd you come back?

483
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:45,353
I can't sleep.

484
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,108
- How is she?
- None of your business.

485
00:51:53,445 --> 00:51:55,363
Can you lend me some cash?

486
00:51:56,573 --> 00:51:57,657
I'll pay you back.

487
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,536
No. Just go and don't come back.

488
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,793
- Is she a black belt now?
- Leave her alone.

489
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:12,881
- I have something for her.
- No!

490
00:52:14,382 --> 00:52:16,217
I'm going crazy there.

491
00:52:18,595 --> 00:52:22,765
She has her second dan.
She's aiming for the Olympics.

492
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:30,773
She's doing well.

493
00:52:30,899 --> 00:52:32,400
She is?

494
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:47,350
Yes?

495
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,812
Is Louise home?

496
00:53:52,188 --> 00:53:53,898
She's out.

497
00:53:55,567 --> 00:53:57,610
- You are...?
- Raymond.

498
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:00,029
Raymond. Sure.

499
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:04,200
You work at the casino, right?

500
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,079
Do you know where she is?

501
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:11,291
Doing errands.

502
00:54:13,293 --> 00:54:15,378
She shouldn't be long.

503
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,716
- Come in and wait.
- No, that's not...

504
00:54:23,511 --> 00:54:26,973
I have 223 days left
till I retire.

505
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:28,891
I counted.

506
00:54:31,436 --> 00:54:34,105
I work in debt collection.

507
00:54:35,148 --> 00:54:36,941
A sort of bailiff.

508
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:38,943
A shitty job.

509
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:43,031
Hitting people
when they're already down.

510
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:51,372
What do you do?

511
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:54,000
- Barman.
- Oh yeah?

512
00:55:01,841 --> 00:55:04,135
Louise can't stand the smell.

513
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:08,139
So I indulge while she's gone.

514
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:13,353
- Care for one?
- No, thank you.

515
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,730
Go on, these are good ones.

516
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:25,782
Enjoy life while we can.

517
00:55:41,506 --> 00:55:42,799
Like it?

518
00:55:43,466 --> 00:55:44,842
Yeah.

519
00:55:45,927 --> 00:55:49,305
Cuban, the best in the world.

520
00:55:55,395 --> 00:55:57,647
Blow toward the purifier.

521
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,032
I shouted, "Don't pull it out!"

522
00:56:08,157 --> 00:56:10,618
The swordfish was still
in the water.

523
00:56:10,743 --> 00:56:13,830
- But he wanted his trophy...
- Who's here?

524
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:33,391
You were gone a while,
so I offered him a cigar.

525
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:40,565
He likes Cuban cigars
even more than me.

526
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:46,696
I looked after your guest...

527
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,449
Raymond.

528
00:56:53,453 --> 00:56:55,663
Well then...

529
00:56:56,748 --> 00:56:59,333
I'll go to the park.
See you later.

530
00:56:59,459 --> 00:57:01,043
Why'd you do this?

531
00:57:03,379 --> 00:57:05,548
What else could I do?

532
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:12,054
It's your decision.

533
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,943
I'll be at the park.

534
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,882
Nothing will stop me.

535
00:57:49,383 --> 00:57:51,385
Holguin, Cuba.

536
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,807
I don't know.

537
00:57:57,642 --> 00:58:02,688
Look, I'm not interested in just
screwing you in the sun.

538
00:58:04,023 --> 00:58:06,108
I want to be with you.

539
00:58:07,276 --> 00:58:10,154
Not just for two weeks.

540
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,199
Every week.

541
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:16,786
All of them!

542
00:58:32,426 --> 00:58:35,179
I know who the guy
in the parking lot is.

543
00:58:35,763 --> 00:58:37,682
Aren't you in enough shit?

544
00:58:38,224 --> 00:58:40,268
Not in shit.
Today, I bounce back.

545
00:58:40,393 --> 00:58:43,145
I told you,
you're talking to a winner.

546
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,524
Forget the parking lot.

547
00:58:46,858 --> 00:58:48,943
Meet me in the toilet in five.

548
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,737
- But what...?
- You need to piss!

549
00:58:52,238 --> 00:58:54,240
<i>'</i> 3° YOU just...?
- Go piss!

550
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:56,659
It'll be better.

551
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,020
For now, we're calling him Jean-Guy.

552
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,662
OK, that's close enough!

553
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:25,122
You're Simon?

554
01:00:25,247 --> 01:00:27,667
Yeah. You, what's your name?

555
01:00:28,501 --> 01:00:30,252
Are you fuckin' with me?

556
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,755
That girl has a big mouth.

557
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,133
She'll spill all she knows.
You're screwed.

558
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:40,721
- The money.
- Gimme the stuff.

559
01:00:41,764 --> 01:00:42,974
The cash first.

560
01:00:43,099 --> 01:00:45,142
It's freezing. Hand it over.

561
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:47,103
I got nothing to lose.

562
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,406
C'mon, there are eyes everywhere.

563
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,742
Where's the rest?

564
01:01:01,867 --> 01:01:04,745
That's it.
Now hand over the stuff.

565
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,707
- It's double or nothing.
- Don't fuck with me!

566
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:10,209
Calm down. Not here, jerk.

567
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:14,088
I told you, I've nothing to lose.

568
01:01:15,006 --> 01:01:17,174
Dickwad!

569
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:25,850
So where's the stuff?

570
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:28,811
The table.

571
01:01:30,771 --> 01:01:32,356
Fuck you.

572
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:36,485
Grab it, Raphael.

573
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,279
- Shit.
- Go on!

574
01:01:43,034 --> 01:01:44,035
How many?

575
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,370
56. Sorry.

576
01:01:46,495 --> 01:01:48,247
Come on! We said 60!

577
01:01:48,372 --> 01:01:49,540
Yeah, but...

578
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,169
Soon as it comes out, I'll call.

579
01:01:58,966 --> 01:02:00,676
Been there myself.

580
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:09,268
Hello.

581
01:02:12,521 --> 01:02:17,526
The guy from the plane...
They've had problems with his BP.

582
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,996
I heard about his leukemia.

583
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:43,427
Why didn't you tell me
he was tested?

584
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:47,348
- Yes?
- Hello, sir.

585
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,267
Jehovah's Witnesses.

586
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:53,145
Sorry to disturb you.'
How are you today?

587
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:57,316
We're visiting the area
to answer your questions.

588
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:02,029
When you look around,
do you find things are going well?

589
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:06,325
We don't, which is why we're here.
To talk about it.

590
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:09,411
Let's not waste time.

591
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:14,625
If planes crash...

592
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:22,174
it's because your omnipotent god
doesn't exist.

593
01:03:24,593 --> 01:03:26,095
Think about it.

594
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:36,730
Let's go.

595
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:47,533
My mom wept all day.

596
01:03:50,035 --> 01:03:51,954
Why'd you tell your dad?

597
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:56,375
- I couldn't take it.
- Yeah.

598
01:03:57,251 --> 01:03:58,544
OK.

599
01:04:02,548 --> 01:04:05,551
People will talk, gossip.

600
01:04:06,969 --> 01:04:08,888
Everyone will know.

601
01:04:14,393 --> 01:04:16,312
Think it's easy for me?

602
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:34,580
I'm scared too.

603
01:04:42,046 --> 01:04:43,339
But...

604
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:46,592
I can't.

605
01:04:48,886 --> 01:04:50,179
We can't.

606
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:53,641
Understand?

607
01:04:55,809 --> 01:04:57,102
We can't.

608
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:00,231
Do we advance the wedding?

609
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,446
- Why?
- It's in 32 days.

610
01:05:07,571 --> 01:05:09,073
In 32 days

611
01:05:10,616 --> 01:05:12,326
we'll get married.

612
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:22,127
Trust me.

613
01:05:35,474 --> 01:05:37,393
"And wherever he entered...

614
01:05:39,144 --> 01:05:42,564
into villages or cities

615
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,276
or countryside...

616
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:51,156
they placed the sick ones
in the marketplaces,

617
01:05:52,241 --> 01:05:54,785
and pled with him
that they might touch

618
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,414
just the fringe
of his outer garment.

619
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,793
And as many as did touch it

620
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:06,338
were made well."

621
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:11,885
Exodus“.

622
01:06:13,304 --> 01:06:17,641
Chapter 15, verse 26.

623
01:06:20,102 --> 01:06:22,021
"And he went on to say,

624
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:27,860
'If you strictly listen
to the voice of Jehovah your God...

625
01:06:32,573 --> 01:06:35,075

<i>After..."</i>

633
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:17,034
Sorry.

634
01:07:32,883 --> 01:07:34,802
You were right to tell him.

635
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,349
It's another test.

636
01:07:42,226 --> 01:07:44,812
We love him.
We have to stand by him.

637
01:07:48,440 --> 01:07:50,651
He needs us, understand?

638
01:07:51,068 --> 01:07:52,694
Completely with him.

639
01:07:53,946 --> 01:07:55,239
Yes.

640
01:08:00,744 --> 01:08:02,371
There's a reason.

641
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,541
All we can do
is support him and pray.

642
01:08:06,417 --> 01:08:08,627
- Understand?
- Yes.

643
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,213
Will you?

644
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,090
- Yes.
- You'll do that?

645
01:08:13,215 --> 01:08:14,508
Yes.

646
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,932
Go away. lsabelle's in the shower.

647
01:11:51,058 --> 01:11:52,559
Is she home?

648
01:11:54,019 --> 01:11:55,937
No, she's at judo.

649
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:59,524
- I said I'd pay you back.
- Don't!

650
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,360
- It's for her.
- No.

651
01:12:01,943 --> 01:12:04,446
- Let me make amends.
- Christ, no!

652
01:12:05,572 --> 01:12:08,283
The cops are after me.
I have to fly south.

653
01:12:08,408 --> 01:12:09,868
Holy Christ!

654
01:12:10,202 --> 01:12:12,496
Help me leave. Anywhere.

655
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:14,581
<i>I'll never come back.</i>

656
01:12:19,169 --> 01:12:20,462
<i>OK.</i>

657
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,466
<i>I'll try to get you out.</i>

658
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:30,722
Be at the airport tonight.
Call me. I'll try something.

659
01:12:31,056 --> 01:12:32,474
But go away.

660
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:37,521
- For her studies.
- What were you thinking? What?

661
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:41,983
She tells us nothing.
What did you do?

662
01:12:42,609 --> 01:12:44,027
I told you.

663
01:12:44,569 --> 01:12:47,030
We don't understand.
She won't tell us.

664
01:12:47,155 --> 01:12:49,700
All she says is no.

665
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:56,498
No.

666
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:02,212
Don't forget to call me.

667
01:13:24,776 --> 01:13:26,278
Can I help you?

668
01:13:30,073 --> 01:13:31,616
I'd like to talk to...

669
01:13:32,576 --> 01:13:34,077
to Karine.

670
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,371
Karine!

671
01:13:59,144 --> 01:14:00,437
What?

672
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:03,982
What?

673
01:14:05,984 --> 01:14:07,486
Are you OK?

674
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,905
Sure. Top shape.

675
01:14:32,344 --> 01:14:33,470
Hello?

676
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:36,056
Samuel?

677
01:14:38,058 --> 01:14:39,768
No, Martin's not here.

678
01:14:41,728 --> 01:14:43,855
Yeah, we're flying out later.

679
01:14:47,317 --> 01:14:49,236
Isn't Martin with you?

680
01:14:52,072 --> 01:14:53,365
<i>Yeah.</i>

681
01:14:56,785 --> 01:14:58,078
<i>OK.</i>

682
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:24,456
When we're finished
moving the chairs over here...

683
01:16:25,290 --> 01:16:28,251
Mom, the wallpaper.
Can you look after it?

684
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:29,794
Diane?

685
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:34,174
Could you do the wallpaper
with my mother?

686
01:16:35,216 --> 01:16:38,011
- Michel and I will do the wiring.
- Etienne?

687
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:41,139
And then,
after, Mr. Thibault...

688
01:16:42,015 --> 01:16:43,308
Etienne?

689
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,186
Sorry...

690
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:50,315
- You OK?
- Mr. Thibault, here...

691
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:54,569
The airline called. They think
they've identified Jean-Guy.

692
01:16:55,445 --> 01:16:57,989
He's the only unaccounted passenger.

693
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:01,576
His wife will identify him.

694
01:17:02,702 --> 01:17:04,412
It won't be easy.

695
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,418
What's his name?

696
01:17:11,294 --> 01:17:12,796
I don't know.

697
01:17:16,341 --> 01:17:18,259
Dr. Sauvé, quick!

698
01:17:20,011 --> 01:17:22,514
He's 70/40, pulse 40.

699
01:17:35,986 --> 01:17:37,988
You just got your second dan?

700
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:43,743
You could've written.

701
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:50,417
This is for you.

702
01:17:51,835 --> 01:17:54,546
Maybe it can help
toward your studies.

703
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:55,797
Why?

704
01:17:59,259 --> 01:18:01,177
Well, for your training...

705
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,514
the Olympics.

706
01:18:05,223 --> 01:18:06,850
- It's a tidy sum.
- Why?

707
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:09,853
You won't have to worry.

708
01:18:12,689 --> 01:18:14,983
I have to change.
Will you wait?

709
01:18:20,655 --> 01:18:22,157
I'm going back.

710
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:24,576
When?

711
01:18:25,368 --> 01:18:26,870
Later tonight.

712
01:18:27,245 --> 01:18:28,496
You're leaving?

713
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:31,541
Why?

714
01:18:35,170 --> 01:18:36,671
You know why.

715
01:18:40,925 --> 01:18:42,844
I've something for you too.

716
01:18:44,387 --> 01:18:45,680
Letters.

717
01:18:46,931 --> 01:18:48,641
What kind of letters?

718
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:50,685
I missed you.

719
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:56,316
- I worry about you.
- You shouldn't.

720
01:18:59,819 --> 01:19:01,321
At the cottage...

721
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:04,115
What I did...

722
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,284
What did you do?

723
01:19:09,788 --> 01:19:11,456
What I did...

724
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,917
What <i>we</i> did.

725
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:19,255
I told them nothing happened.

726
01:19:24,302 --> 01:19:26,721
- Karine, I...
- Why give me money?

727
01:19:30,266 --> 01:19:31,559
You know.

728
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:34,187
What?

729
01:19:37,982 --> 01:19:39,275
You know.

730
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:43,071
What?

731
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:49,994
I'll get changed.

732
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:52,747
I'll be right back.

733
01:19:57,502 --> 01:19:59,003
Wait for me!

734
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:03,401
Now where?

735
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:16,497
The airport.

736
01:21:21,252 --> 01:21:22,545
Yes.

737
01:21:23,004 --> 01:21:26,090
She'll identify him
when he comes out of the OR.

738
01:21:26,716 --> 01:21:29,177
Yes. Complications.

739
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:31,721
Hemorrhaging.

740
01:21:32,263 --> 01:21:33,681
- Yes.
- Madame?

741
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:36,059
- What?
- Your cell, please.

742
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:40,605
Excuse me, is everything alright?

743
01:21:41,606 --> 01:21:43,149
Are you the wife of Patient 6?

744
01:21:43,274 --> 01:21:45,777
Yes.

745
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,820
Don't worry.

746
01:21:48,363 --> 01:21:51,699
Yes. OK, I have to go.

747
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:54,869
You have to turn off your phone.

748
01:21:57,705 --> 01:21:58,831
Etienne?

749
01:21:58,957 --> 01:22:01,042
- I brought you a coffee.
- Thanks.

750
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:04,504
- I want you to take a break.
- Put it on the table.

751
01:22:04,629 --> 01:22:07,173
- Take a break now, please.
- Hand me...

752
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:08,549
- Etienne?
- What?

753
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,051
Now.

754
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,076
We have an emergency in the OR.

755
01:22:35,201 --> 01:22:37,120
You're type O negative?

756
01:22:37,996 --> 01:22:39,831
It's in the hospital files.

757
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:43,084
I know your religious principles.

758
01:22:45,545 --> 01:22:46,754
The crash survivor?

759
01:22:46,879 --> 01:22:48,798
<i>O negative like him.</i>

760
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:52,677
<i>No, I can't do it.</i>

761
01:22:54,178 --> 01:22:55,888
<i>He needs your blood.</i>

762
01:22:57,265 --> 01:23:01,644
<i>He's still in surgery.
We'll lose him in the next hour.</i>

763
01:23:04,689 --> 01:23:06,190
But I can't.

764
01:23:07,734 --> 01:23:09,652
You're his last chance.

765
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,946
He's going to die.

766
01:23:12,780 --> 01:23:14,490
You can save him.

767
01:23:17,618 --> 01:23:19,954
- For Cuba?
- Yes, right here.

768
01:23:25,835 --> 01:23:29,922
- Where's Mr. Lemay?
- He's coming. It may be tight.

769
01:23:32,008 --> 01:23:33,384
Is he in the airport?

770
01:23:34,218 --> 01:23:36,220
Can I check him in anyway?

771
01:23:36,346 --> 01:23:39,223
He's at a meeting.
It'll be tight.

772
01:23:49,150 --> 01:23:51,652
Alright, but don't tell anyone.

773
01:23:52,362 --> 01:23:54,197
Thanks, it's kind of you.

774
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,326
The suitcase, under your name?

775
01:24:03,581 --> 01:24:06,834
Madame? ls the suitcase yours?

776
01:24:08,044 --> 01:24:10,004
No, it's his.

777
01:24:25,103 --> 01:24:26,813
Why are you doing it?

778
01:24:32,777 --> 01:24:34,070
Go ahead.

779
01:24:38,491 --> 01:24:39,784
Stop.

780
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:49,502
Julie.

781
01:24:51,295 --> 01:24:53,005
You'll be shunned.

782
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,404
Did the operation go alright?

783
01:25:58,738 --> 01:26:00,907
Yes. It went fine.

784
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:05,786
It has to be him.
He's the only one not identified.

785
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:08,956
He's burned, right?

786
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,089
I should've been with him.

787
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:21,886
I was sure he was dead.

788
01:26:23,095 --> 01:26:24,805
He'll make it.

789
01:26:25,389 --> 01:26:26,474
He Will?

790
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:28,851
He's saved.

791
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:41,030
Would you mind?

792
01:26:47,453 --> 01:26:50,706
<i>Once you pass security,
go to Gate 34,</i>

793
01:26:50,831 --> 01:26:53,042
<i>the flight to Holguin, Cuba.</i>

794
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:56,629
Someone else's place?

795
01:26:56,754 --> 01:26:58,714
Yeah, a passenger's late.

796
01:26:59,674 --> 01:27:01,425
Won't you get in trouble?

797
01:27:02,301 --> 01:27:06,013
No, when they realize the mistake,
you'll be in the air.

798
01:27:08,266 --> 01:27:10,643
- <i>Look,</i> I...
- <i>No, I don't have time.</i>

799
01:27:10,768 --> 01:27:12,061
Wait.

800
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:15,439
I won't come back.

801
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,693
I just wanted to say...

802
01:27:59,984 --> 01:28:01,902
Twice in one day...

803
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:04,739
That's a first.

804
01:28:10,411 --> 01:28:12,747
We can't miss the flight.

805
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:18,419
But your body's irresistible!

806
01:28:28,262 --> 01:28:29,972
Today was hell.

807
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,433
Hell.

808
01:28:40,900 --> 01:28:42,818
Did you take my sunglasses?

809
01:28:46,197 --> 01:28:47,490
I hope so.

810
01:28:49,742 --> 01:28:52,703
- What gate is it?
- 34.

811
01:28:53,954 --> 01:28:55,247
Oh yeah?

812
01:28:56,499 --> 01:28:58,000
You're right.

813
01:29:00,961 --> 01:29:03,381
What's that look all about?

814
01:29:12,014 --> 01:29:13,933
I'm not going with you.

815
01:29:19,689 --> 01:29:21,357
I don't love you.

816
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:25,277
It's all gone.

817
01:29:26,612 --> 01:29:29,198
I feel nothing for you.

818
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,204
I don't care where you were.

819
01:29:42,128 --> 01:29:44,255
I'll move out of the house.

820
01:29:47,049 --> 01:29:48,259
Have a good flight.

821
01:30:04,567 --> 01:30:05,651
Two minutes?

822
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:21,417
<i>I don't know how to tell you this...</i>

823
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:27,465
<i>It's not my husband, right?</i>

824
01:30:58,245 --> 01:30:59,747
Have a good flight.

825
01:32:04,770 --> 01:32:06,105
<i>Etienne?</i>

826
01:32:07,273 --> 01:32:09,733
- <i>Etienne?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

827
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:13,362
<i>The hospital called.
There was a big plane crash.</i>

828
01:32:13,988 --> 01:32:15,614
<i>I'll take your car, OK?</i>

829
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,785
<i>A plane crashed?</i>

830
01:32:19,910 --> 01:32:21,203
<i>Yes.</i>

831
01:32:22,329 --> 01:32:24,665
<i>A big pl...
Were many people killed?</i>

832
01:33:23,724 --> 01:33:28,771
<i>Attention, the following passengers

834
01:33:31,065 --> 01:33:32,775

835
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:34,985

836
01:33:35,110 --> 01:33:37,112
<i>Martin Lemay, Evelyne Lemay,</i>

837
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:39,782
<i>Raymond Samson
and Louise Carpentier.</i>..

838
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:44,703
Can't do it?

839
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:52,044
We don't have to leave.

840
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,546
We can just go to a hotel.

841
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,931
I'll tell them.

842
01:34:25,452 --> 01:34:26,954
Afraid to fly?

843
01:34:27,746 --> 01:34:29,123
I'm just terrified.

844
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:35,045
It's just for her...

845
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,677
Yeah.

846
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,891
Damn, I love her.

847
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,906
Have a nice day?

848
01:35:04,700 --> 01:35:07,202
- Where's Etienne?
- He's resting.

849
01:35:07,870 --> 01:35:09,496
Did something happen?

850
01:35:10,122 --> 01:35:13,417
He's fine. He works like crazy,
that's all.

851
01:35:16,003 --> 01:35:17,755
He's sleeping downstairs.

852
01:35:19,006 --> 01:35:20,466
Sit down.

853
01:35:20,591 --> 01:35:22,968
Madeleine's warming up some supper.

854
01:35:25,179 --> 01:35:26,472
Julie.

855
01:35:30,267 --> 01:35:31,769
Let him rest.

856
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:35,606
It'll be fine.

857
01:35:57,544 --> 01:36:00,380
- Don't touch me.
- You're burning.

858
01:36:00,923 --> 01:36:02,925
No, I'm cold. Stop it.

859
01:36:10,099 --> 01:36:13,268
- You know you're not OK.
- I said I'm fine.

860
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,646
You're getting pneumonia.

861
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,826
Go to the hospital.

862
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,705
I can't.

863
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:37,084
Yes, you can.
You just have to decide to.

864
01:36:41,004 --> 01:36:44,508
- Stop it. Stop.
- They can save you.

865
01:36:45,759 --> 01:36:46,802
No.

866
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:51,723
We must follow His Word.

867
01:36:53,350 --> 01:36:55,769
- Follow His Word.
- Etienne...

868
01:36:57,062 --> 01:36:58,981
We'll go to the hospital.

869
01:37:03,235 --> 01:37:04,736
Or I'll leave.

870
01:37:07,656 --> 01:37:09,366
You won't see me again.

871
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:12,578
What do you mean?

872
01:37:13,996 --> 01:37:15,497
Come with me.

873
01:37:20,419 --> 01:37:21,712
"Only...

874
01:37:24,298 --> 01:37:28,802
flesh with its soul-
its blood-

875
01:37:29,845 --> 01:37:31,847
you must not eat..."

876
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:34,349
"And...

877
01:37:35,601 --> 01:37:36,894
And...

878
01:37:38,520 --> 01:37:40,230
besides that,

879
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,151
your blood of <i>your</i> souls...

880
01:37:45,861 --> 01:37:47,571
shall I ask back."

881
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,956
I'll resurrect with the others.

882
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,378
'H..-

883
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:07,674
For sure, there'll be
a place for me...

884
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:20,604
I gave blood.

885
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,740
I'm leaving.

886
01:38:42,918 --> 01:38:44,836
You know I love you.

887
01:39:35,971 --> 01:39:38,557
What'll you do? Where'll you go?

888
01:39:38,932 --> 01:39:40,767
If you want him to die...

889
01:39:42,811 --> 01:39:44,938
I can't go on doing nothing.

890
01:39:56,116 --> 01:39:57,617
Hello, sir.

891
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:01,496
You OK?

892
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:04,958
Great. You?

893
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,142
You're still here?

894
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,437
You made your decision.

895
01:40:34,321 --> 01:40:35,489
I'm starving.

896
01:40:36,031 --> 01:40:38,325
- There's lasagna.
- OK.

897
01:40:46,625 --> 01:40:49,419
Seat D26. Have a good flight.

898
01:43:05,805 --> 01:43:07,516
He died yesterday.

899
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:42,676
<i>If planes crash...</i>

900
01:43:46,012 --> 01:43:49,766
<i>it's because your omnipotent god
doesn't exist.</i>
