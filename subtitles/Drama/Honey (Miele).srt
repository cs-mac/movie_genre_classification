1
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,248
I'm ready.

2
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:59,113
We can stop here.

3
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:06,050
- Let's carry on.
- As you wish.

4
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,422
I brought music,
or do you have your own?

5
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,522
- Yes, here.
- Sit next to me.

6
00:02:14,601 --> 00:02:17,092
I'll leave you alone now.

7
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,904
- Chilly today.
- No, it's fine.

8
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:07,604
Good-bye.

9
00:04:53,926 --> 00:04:55,416
What are you listening to?

10
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,931
- Bad music as usual.
- Why are you here so early?

11
00:04:59,532 --> 00:05:01,966
I have to pick the kids up
in 30 minutes.

12
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,832
- Want some coffee?
- No, I want you.

13
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:07,105
Do you want coffee?

14
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,803
- I want you.
- No way.

15
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:18,812
Let me take a look at the situation.

16
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,645
Just in time, I'm leaving tonight.

17
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,883
- Padua again?
- My professor's expecting me.

18
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,855
When do you get back?

19
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,227
Never.

20
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:42,039
HONEY

21
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,057
Hello?

22
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,689
Who's speaking?

23
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,068
Sorry, I can't talk right now.

24
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,474
But you should contact
our mutual friend for that info.

25
00:06:19,912 --> 00:06:21,812
That's right, call him.

26
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,018
No, I'm sorry, this is the procedure.

27
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:29,345
Have a good day.

28
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,513
Attention, please.

29
00:06:30,623 --> 00:06:35,651
This is the final call for flight MEXK256

30
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:36,956
for Los Angeles.

31
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,121
Please board immediately.

32
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,721
My dog is very sick.

33
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:47,857
I'd like to put him down myself.

34
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:52,195
My dog is very sick.

35
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:54,425
I'd like to put him down myself.

36
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,503
Good morning.

37
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:16,654
Hello.

38
00:09:21,794 --> 00:09:24,092
I need some Lamputal, please.

39
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:28,391
- Excuse me?
- Lamputal.

40
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,069
My dog is very sick.

41
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:37,665
I'd like to put him down myself.

42
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:42,914
Excuse me.

43
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:56,427
- How old is your dog?
- Fourteen.

44
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,730
Poor thing.

45
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,994
Two.

46
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,803
Last stop: Forli, Piazza Saffi.

47
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,602
Forli, Piazza Saffi.

48
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:20,670
Good morning, Honey.

49
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:50,103
- Has she been taking the Vaxolon?
- Of course.

50
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:55,442
Give her another so she doesn't vomit,
but give her 20 drops of this first.

51
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,142
It'll make her feel better, calmer.

52
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,411
Okay, I will.

53
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:34,109
I've put the written statement
on the table.

54
00:12:35,788 --> 00:12:38,689
Fine, though you won't need it.

55
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:54,831
Here she is.

56
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:04,411
- Carla.
- How are you, Honey?

57
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,553
Are you going to ask me again
if I've changed my mind?

58
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:14,991
Yes, Carla, you still have time.

59
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:18,257
I'll ask you one last time,
then I won't ask again.

60
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,197
- Do you want us to stop?
- No.

61
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,268
I haven't changed my mind.

62
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:25,526
All right.

63
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:29,170
Did you find the chocolate?

64
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,833
Yes.

65
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:34,106
- The one I asked for?
- Yes.

66
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,744
I'll leave you on your own a minute.

67
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,601
Ennio.

68
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,681
Ennio, listen carefully.

69
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,018
Listen carefully.

70
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:29,561
She has to drink all the Lamputal,
it's essential.

71
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:33,962
And remember, don't touch the glasses
once they're on the nightstand.

72
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:35,090
Understand?

73
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,794
Only Carla can touch them after that.

74
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:39,530
Understand?

75
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,503
She has to do it all herself.

76
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,905
Do you remember what we said?

77
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:46,838
Bring the tray.

78
00:15:58,257 --> 00:16:02,421
Ennio, Carla needs your help now.

79
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,723
You won't help her like this.

80
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,695
Be strong.

81
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,587
I'll put on the music you requested.

82
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:37,252
Thank you.

83
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,943
It's bitter.

84
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,771
Really bitter.

85
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,094
How long will it take?

86
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,538
Two, three minutes.

87
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,476
That's it?

88
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:08,226
Meet you there,
I have to get some lures.

89
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,728
I'll ask her.

90
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,065
It's Luciano, we're taking
the boat out on Sunday morning.

91
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,701
Then we can stop by your place
and eat some fish.

92
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,573
No, I'm in Padua on Sunday, Dad.

93
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:22,306
I told you.

94
00:21:22,414 --> 00:21:24,905
That's right.

95
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,453
No, Irene has to go see
her university professor.

96
00:21:29,354 --> 00:21:31,083
On a Sunday?

97
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,870
I have an appointment
early Monday morning.

98
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:40,187
Yes, me too.

99
00:21:40,732 --> 00:21:45,032
But I'll leave you my keys,
so you can eat your fish at my place.

100
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:48,268
Yes, thanks.

101
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,298
Yes, of course, yes.

102
00:22:16,968 --> 00:22:18,435
Here.

103
00:22:18,537 --> 00:22:21,938
His name's Grimaldi,
he's an engineer here in Rome.

104
00:22:23,442 --> 00:22:24,636
Rome?

105
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:26,711
Why are you sending me?

106
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:31,005
He'll be the only one at the meeting.

107
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:33,209
There will be no family.

108
00:22:33,318 --> 00:22:36,583
Just go there, give him the stuff,
and explain the procedure.

109
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,380
He wants to do it himself.

110
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,056
What do you mean?

111
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,388
We've never done it like that before.

112
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,436
It's too risky,
for the patient and for us.

113
00:22:52,971 --> 00:22:56,099
The "rabbit," as you call him,
is a reliable contact.

114
00:22:56,208 --> 00:23:00,076
He's a bit unusual as doctors go,
but he's sharp.

115
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:03,978
I gave him your number
so he could explain the situation.

116
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:13,881
What's wrong?

117
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,724
- What's up?
- Nothing.

118
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:21,925
I feel this thing, like a flutter,
a shiver, but it's nothing.

119
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:25,434
You're probably tired
from your trip and the jet lag.

120
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,806
Nothing happens for months,
and now everything at once.

121
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,242
How many have you got left?

122
00:23:42,354 --> 00:23:46,518
I had one, and I bought
two more on my last trip.

123
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,456
You are careful?

124
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,050
I am careful.

125
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,942
Mr. Grimaldi?

126
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,163
Hello?

127
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,137
Come in.

128
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,284
Good morning.

129
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,656
Come in, I don't bite.

130
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,797
Nice to meet you, I'm Honey.

131
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,958
Sorry?

132
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,299
Honey is my work name.

133
00:25:07,405 --> 00:25:10,306
- Take a seat.
- Thanks.

134
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,874
- Do you smoke?
- No, thanks.

135
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,640
Of course not.

136
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,878
So give me all the details.

137
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:21,382
I'm in your hands.

138
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:23,750
I've never died before.

139
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:27,547
Ask me questions,
and I'll try to answer them.

140
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,126
Right, questions.

141
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:31,995
Will it be very painful?

142
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,931
No, not at all.

143
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,501
If you decide to go ahead with it,

144
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:41,936
I'll give you instructions
that you must follow carefully.

145
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,134
Then I'll give you
a substance, tetrabamate.

146
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:48,701
It's a barbiturate,
you'll have to swallow it.

147
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:50,280
Is that the only way?

148
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,846
No, there is an alternative,
what we call method B.

149
00:25:55,954 --> 00:26:00,482
But in your case it's out of the question
since you don't want my help.

150
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:02,958
- Or am I mistaken?
- No, you're not mistaken.

151
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,995
But you see,
yours is an unusual case,

152
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,657
I always assist the patient
during the whole procedure.

153
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,827
I don't think it will be necessary
to meet again.

154
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,008
So what do I need you for?

155
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:23,005
My doctor could've prescribed
a ton of barbiturates.

156
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,676
Perhaps you don't know lethal barbiturates
have been taken off the market,

157
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,275
precisely because they're dangerous.

158
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,513
They can't be prescribed.

159
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,089
How do you get them?

160
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:34,420
Do you make them yourself at home?

161
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,426
Are you a little chemist?

162
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,354
I buy veterinary barbiturates.

163
00:26:39,464 --> 00:26:43,025
- In Switzerland?
- No, I get them in Mexico.

164
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:46,934
But I don't have to tell you all this,
you can check for yourself.

165
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:49,734
You told me to ask questions.

166
00:26:51,076 --> 00:26:53,340
Yes, I'm sorry, you're right.

167
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,347
I could jump out of the window,
we're on the fifth floor.

168
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,650
But then...

169
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:08,951
the onlookers, the neighbors...

170
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,652
Goodness, no.

171
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:19,300
My doctor said you also take care of...

172
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,799
the soundtrack.

173
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:27,072
- Is that true?
- Yes.

174
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:30,047
How thoughtful of you.

175
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:33,379
And do you have a repertoire?

176
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:38,388
It's a very personal choice,
so you would tell me what you'd like.

177
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,084
Can I play something for you?

178
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,602
Forgive me.

179
00:29:04,008 --> 00:29:07,409
Don't worry.
Listen, I can help you.

180
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:11,039
I mean it,
but only if you want me to.

181
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:14,346
Do you have it with you, this tetra...

182
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,745
Yes.

183
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:27,354
But if you don't mind me saying so,
you shouldn't do it alone.

184
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,068
Think it over.

185
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:33,433
You could use help.

186
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,440
Here are the instructions,
we can review them.

187
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:41,444
And, if you have
any questions, any doubts,

188
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:45,378
if you change your mind,
just let me know.

189
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:55,685
A Labrador.

190
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:55,511
- The "Happy Birthday" kit or the "I Love You"?
- Which is the biggest?

191
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,344
Both have five kg of helium,
but the number of balloons changes.

192
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:02,010
"Happy Birthday" has 50,
"I Love You" has 25.

193
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,587
These are heart-shaped.

194
00:32:03,688 --> 00:32:05,280
Which do you want?

195
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,240
Will I suffocate?

196
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,499
No, you won't suffocate.

197
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,943
You'll breathe easily
and immediately pass out.

198
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:08,581
You'll feel slightly dizzy,
like with altitude sickness,

199
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,317
because the helium brings
the oxygen level down.

200
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:15,791
You won't feel anything
after a few breaths.

201
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,994
Will this gas
be dangerous for my sister?

202
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:23,799
There's no risk,
helium is an inert gas.

203
00:33:23,901 --> 00:33:25,869
It disperses without doing any harm.

204
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:28,131
Or they wouldn't use it
at kids' parties.

205
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:30,002
What?

206
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:31,939
What did you say?
I didn't hear that.

207
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:36,173
You won't be in any danger
since helium is an inert gas,

208
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,771
it disperses without doing any harm.

209
00:33:40,618 --> 00:33:43,246
Read the...

210
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,919
No, you read it.

211
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:58,635
"Due to the rapid decline of my health,

212
00:33:58,736 --> 00:34:01,637
I can no longer call this living.

213
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:05,937
I have decided to speed things up.
Let it be known, I did it all on my own.

214
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,103
Filippo Porchielli."

215
00:34:12,316 --> 00:34:13,874
Perfect.

216
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:16,680
But you won't need it, you'll see.

217
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,348
I don't think I'll be seeing much.

218
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,857
- Will I?
- I'm sorry.

219
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,925
Any more questions?

220
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,227
Can I do it on the bed?

221
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:33,792
Yes, as long as you're not lying down.

222
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,306
Sitting up?

223
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,075
Okay.

224
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:44,012
Listen, we can stop at any time.

225
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,583
I'll ask you again, even tomorrow.

226
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,915
You can just say "stop" at any time.

227
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:53,513
- You can still change your mind.
- Tomorrow.

228
00:34:57,695 --> 00:35:00,994
- Good-bye.
- Come at 11:00.

229
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,966
Give me time to make myself pretty.

230
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:20,511
What a shitty job you have.

231
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,883
No, thanks, I'll take it tomorrow.

232
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:28,912
But she's leaving soon,
I'll have to find a new roommate.

233
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,250
Pity she's leaving.

234
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,346
She's pretty.
What's her name?

235
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,553
Her name's Bai Xing Xing.

236
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:44,063
That's why she's leaving.
Bye, Xing Xing!

237
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:45,965
Bye, Xing Xing.

238
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,207
What's up?

239
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:12,159
Aren't you jealous?

240
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,187
Of what?

241
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:19,199
Because you have to share me.

242
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:22,762
I wouldn't like it.

243
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:28,740
- Share what?
- What's that?

244
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:33,181
- Is that your phone?
- Mine doesn't vibrate.

245
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,550
- You've got another phone?
- It's not mine.

246
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,717
- It belongs to the department.
- Yeah.

247
00:37:42,827 --> 00:37:45,125
For dissertation interviews.

248
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,287
- Hello?
- Good morning.

249
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:47,864
One second.

250
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:51,293
- Who is it?
- Mr. Grimaldi.

251
00:37:51,402 --> 00:37:53,597
- Carlo Grimaldi, remember?
- Yes.

252
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:55,899
I'm sorry to disturb you again,

253
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,568
but I need to ask you something
about the procedure.

254
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,808
- Have you got a minute?
- Yes, of course. Go ahead.

255
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:05,973
I wanted to know...

256
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,450
- Well...
- Yes?

257
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:14,115
If there were to be an autopsy,
would the substance leave a trace?

258
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,319
No, absolutely not,
it leaves no trace.

259
00:38:17,428 --> 00:38:20,955
And as I told you before,
they rarely perform an autopsy.

260
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:27,026
In cases of terminal illness,
doctors certify natural death.

261
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:29,538
What terminal illness?

262
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,608
Why? Aren't you...

263
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,647
What?

264
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,614
No, I'm brimming with health.

265
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,989
Thanks for the information,
have a good day.

266
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,665
What the fuck were you thinking?

267
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,767
I help sick people!

268
00:38:57,868 --> 00:39:00,428
I'm not a hired killer!
You're crazy!

269
00:39:00,538 --> 00:39:02,199
Quiet.

270
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:04,900
Do you realize
what the rabbit has done?

271
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,443
That fucking spineless friend of yours.

272
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,172
Did you know about this or not?

273
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,807
Tell me!

274
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,182
If you don't know, let me tell you.

275
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,613
The old guy...

276
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,954
is healthier than
you and I put together.

277
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:24,994
He said, "I'm brimming with health"!

278
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:26,825
Understand, Rocco?

279
00:39:26,931 --> 00:39:28,956
So what?

280
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,132
I don't kill depressed people.

281
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,304
Irene...

282
00:39:36,173 --> 00:39:40,337
sometimes it's hard to know
where our limit lies.

283
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:42,207
- There are no rules.
- No?

284
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:44,941
- No, ma'am.
- I do have rules.

285
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:47,450
I thought you did too.

286
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,543
Give me the neurologist's number.

287
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:53,054
- Give me his number!
- Calm down and go home.

288
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:57,491
I'll call the neurologist. Don't ever
make another scene like this again.

289
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:20,340
- Good morning.
- Can I have a word with you?

290
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:27,323
We need to call it off,
there was a misunderstanding.

291
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:30,326
No, there wasn't, the deal is closed.

292
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:33,455
- Good-bye.
- No, you lied to me.

293
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:37,091
- You didn't ask me anything.
- Yes, but I just assumed you were sick.

294
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,998
You assumed.

295
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:42,368
Now if you don't mind,
Miss Honey, I'm busy.

296
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:43,906
Where are you going?

297
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,510
How dare you?

298
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,409
What are...

299
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,408
- What are you doing?
- Let go of me.

300
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:00,356
Yes.

301
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:02,255
No, I'll call you back.

302
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,488
Where are you going?

303
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,859
What are you doing?
Please, I want you out of here.

304
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:13,027
- Where did you put that fucking bottle?
- You have to leave!

305
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,900
Where are you going?

306
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,905
Let go of me!

307
00:41:20,177 --> 00:41:22,771
That's enough now.
Get out!

308
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,747
- You have to give it back!
- And if I don't?

309
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,579
Will you call the police?

310
00:41:28,118 --> 00:41:32,248
You're the one who sold me
an illegal substance.

311
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,519
I'll call the police if you want.

312
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:37,184
Get out!

313
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,258
Fuck off, you mangy old dog!

314
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,853
My friend's got a lot
of stamina, doesn't she?

315
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,658
I sometimes feel
I can't catch my breath.

316
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,756
It's hard to breathe.

317
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:23,069
My heart starts to beat so fast.

318
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,541
What's that there?

319
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,614
Why's it doing that?

320
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,777
Why's it doing that?

321
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,951
Everything's fine, Irene, don't worry.

322
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,956
Everything's fine.

323
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,845
Dad?

324
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:45,913
Dad.

325
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:47,684
It's me, don't be scared.

326
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:50,950
Seven.

327
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,796
- I could've done six plus one.
- You could have.

328
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:02,599
Don't be a nag.

329
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:05,300
Pick yours up, please.

330
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:15,111
Good evening, Professor.

331
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,443
The police came yesterday,
they asked about you.

332
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,210
What did they want?

333
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:23,377
They were checking
your change of address.

334
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:26,115
They checked on me
when I moved here too.

335
00:45:26,924 --> 00:45:29,017
They asked if I knew you,
they took notes.

336
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:33,825
- Everything's fine now.
- All right, thank you.

337
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:37,094
- Good-bye, Irene.
- Good evening, Professor.

338
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,000
The next day he sent me
a message on Facebook.

339
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,479
"I feel I saw a certain sparkle
in your eyes."

340
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:53,242
Can you call a number
from your cell?

341
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,874
Wait a minute.

342
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:56,782
Bella!

343
00:45:59,957 --> 00:46:03,484
If he answers, say you've got
the wrong number and hang up.

344
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,187
It's ringing.

345
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:12,034
Hello?

346
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,427
Is Chiara there?

347
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,599
What?

348
00:46:17,508 --> 00:46:19,373
I'm sorry,
I've got the wrong number.

349
00:46:19,476 --> 00:46:21,376
Good-bye, sorry.

350
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,303
He sounds like an old man.

351
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:26,315
Who is he?

352
00:47:07,457 --> 00:47:09,516
- Come in.
- Good morning.

353
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:16,261
Sorry about the other day,
can we talk about it calmly?

354
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,130
I just can't take my eyes
off the screen.

355
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:23,502
Today's contestants
are Gillian and Christina,

356
00:47:23,607 --> 00:47:27,270
and the fabulous prey is Jamie.

357
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:28,935
Have a seat.

358
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:32,313
Their parents participate too.

359
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,421
Daddy and Mommy.

360
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,457
They said, "No sex."

361
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,993
There she is.

362
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,585
Now the two girls
start smacking each other.

363
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,895
You see, Christina just said,

364
00:47:51,001 --> 00:47:54,528
"I'm a nice, funny girl."

365
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:59,473
And the blonde girl said,
"I'm sweet and passionate."

366
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,534
Isn't it funny?

367
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,443
"Sweet and passionate."
I watch it every day.

368
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:07,608
Sir, I came back here
so we could talk.

369
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,482
- So I could explain...
- Can you imagine?

370
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,420
"Hi, my name is Honey.

371
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:17,323
I'm bashful and solitary."

372
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,486
Isn't it wonderful?

373
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,327
What's your problem?
Ugly TV shows?

374
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:26,732
I don't give a shit about ugliness.

375
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:29,738
The uglier you are, the better.

376
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,364
Who's ugly?

377
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:34,467
That's why you want to end your life?

378
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,976
Not enough for you?

379
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,846
Is there a list of acceptable reasons?

380
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:45,079
Would you rather I told you
I have a terrible secret,

381
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,383
a crime to atone for?

382
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,551
I don't owe you an explanation.

383
00:48:51,128 --> 00:48:52,891
You sell, I buy.

384
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,328
That's not exactly the case. I help.

385
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,730
But not people like you,
you can live!

386
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,826
For all I know, not all your clients
are on the verge of death.

387
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,634
- You have no right to...
- Oh, please.

388
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:11,737
All in all, I've had a good life,
a successful career.

389
00:49:11,848 --> 00:49:14,976
I've been everywhere,
even Mexico like you.

390
00:49:15,085 --> 00:49:18,282
I got married and divorced,
I have friends.

391
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:19,878
What else?

392
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,959
- Kids?
- We didn't want any.

393
00:49:23,493 --> 00:49:26,985
That was the one thing
my wife and I agreed upon.

394
00:49:28,865 --> 00:49:34,735
Believe me,
I've lost interest in everything.

395
00:49:34,838 --> 00:49:37,807
It's all so boring and insignificant.

396
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:43,212
I can understand,
it's easier to help the terminally ill.

397
00:49:43,313 --> 00:49:47,977
Nobody can stand the sight
of a body falling apart.

398
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,452
It's natural to feel pity then.

399
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,959
But if the illness is invisible, then what?

400
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,323
Is it just a whim, heresy?

401
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:02,626
This thing you do for money,

402
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,794
everybody should be able to do it.

403
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,731
The sick don't have
more rights than me.

404
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,830
I disagree.

405
00:50:10,941 --> 00:50:13,239
I've already argued with your doctor.

406
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:16,574
This is not what we do,
or at least not what I do.

407
00:50:17,414 --> 00:50:22,681
Is saving me some sort
of redemption for all the others?

408
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:26,153
I don't need redemption,
I believe in what I do.

409
00:50:26,256 --> 00:50:29,714
But I don't want you on my conscience
'cause I disagree with your choice.

410
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:30,986
Is that clear?

411
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:37,527
I've worked up an appetite,
want to get some food?

412
00:50:40,937 --> 00:50:41,004
Then there's another legend
about Suleymaniye Mosque.

413
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:45,236
Then there's another legend
about Suleymaniye Mosque.

414
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:52,407
Apparently the architect took advantage
of the airstreams to support the dome.

415
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,246
- Everything okay?
- Yes, thanks.

416
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,549
- Since it's not crowded, can I smoke?
- Sure.

417
00:50:58,655 --> 00:51:00,282
No, thanks.

418
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:06,192
The upward air current which flows
along the flutes of the columns

419
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,692
helps to support the dome, understand?

420
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:10,733
Sort of.

421
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,426
Is that possible?

422
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:16,165
I doubt it,
but it's a fascinating story.

423
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:20,940
Actually, if you go to Istanbul one day...

424
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:25,745
place a sheet of paper
beneath the dome.

425
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,541
What will happen?

426
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,586
Perhaps nothing.

427
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:33,112
You'll let me know.

428
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:39,985
What were you studying before...

429
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:44,256
Medicine,
but just for a few years.

430
00:51:44,367 --> 00:51:47,564
Right, too many years, too hard.

431
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:55,176
So this, shall we call it "activity,"
of yours is your job?

432
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,238
You do nothing else?

433
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,710
You don't have any plans, ambitions?

434
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,917
What we do is important.

435
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,494
Okay, but don't start
getting all ideological.

436
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:17,397
What are you, a group
of combatants for euthanasia?

437
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:22,905
With the rates you charge,
not many people can afford a dignified end.

438
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:24,701
You don't know what you're saying.

439
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:29,541
You're free to consider me a mercenary,
I don't care what you think about me.

440
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:33,776
No, sorry, I'm intrigued,
that's why I ask.

441
00:52:33,884 --> 00:52:36,250
How do you do it, technically?

442
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,253
You live with your parents?

443
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:44,260
Do you hide the dog poison
in your room?

444
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:47,819
What do you tell your mom
when you return from Mexico?

445
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,225
My mother died 10 years ago.

446
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,835
An illness?

447
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,300
Yes.

448
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,813
What's that thing in your mouth?

449
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,979
- What?
- That.

450
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,513
A piercing.

451
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,352
What's it for?

452
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:22,227
It must have some meaning for you.

453
00:53:22,332 --> 00:53:24,800
- Yes.
- Such as?

454
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:28,803
I read that Aztec priests
pierced their tongues with agave thorns.

455
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,600
What for?

456
00:53:31,741 --> 00:53:35,302
New life bloomed from the blood
of the sacrifice, like an agave flower.

457
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:38,472
- Bullshit.
- Why?

458
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,508
There's no escaping contemporary idiocy.

459
00:53:44,287 --> 00:53:47,313
I have to go catch my train.

460
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:51,121
You can stay at my place,
I have an extra room.

461
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,320
No, thanks.

462
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:11,504
You'll have to make do.

463
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:25,392
If you need anything else,
it's all in there.

464
00:54:26,496 --> 00:54:27,520
Thanks.

465
00:54:27,631 --> 00:54:30,725
- Good night, Honey.
- Irene.

466
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,563
My name is Irene.

467
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,469
Much better.

468
00:55:36,566 --> 00:55:38,033
Sir?

469
00:56:21,811 --> 00:56:23,802
Find anything?

470
00:56:26,416 --> 00:56:28,509
Want breakfast?

471
00:56:29,319 --> 00:56:30,809
Yes, thanks.

472
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:35,090
All right, I'll call you later.

473
00:56:35,191 --> 00:56:37,887
Okay, bye.

474
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:45,100
What is it?

475
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:49,202
Still seeing her?

476
00:56:49,305 --> 00:56:51,933
- Who?
- Her.

477
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:53,872
Oh, her! No.

478
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,445
Yes, every now and then.

479
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,242
Why?

480
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:01,216
Are you still jealous?

481
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,018
Sometimes.

482
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:08,524
Let's talk about it.

483
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,286
Some other day.

484
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:12,827
Give me that number.

485
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:14,487
I have to go.

486
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,100
Here you go.

487
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,537
- 0422?
- It's in Treviso.

488
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,541
All right, bye.

489
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,672
Next week in Treviso,

490
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:33,373
it's a young guy.

491
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,808
Sorry, the batteries are dying.

492
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,921
Did you hurt yourself?

493
00:59:21,891 --> 00:59:23,381
Come on.

494
00:59:52,355 --> 00:59:57,725
I like Italians,
they're cheerful and friendly.

495
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:00,227
And the ladies are beauties!

496
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,196
Italian ladies are pretty.

497
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,462
I really like them, such happy people.

498
01:00:06,569 --> 01:00:09,299
I adore Italian ladies.

499
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:16,177
Sometimes I compare them
with Mexican women.

500
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:20,546
They're so affectionate, attentive.

501
01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:24,046
But most of all they're happy,
and they like dancing.

502
01:00:55,284 --> 01:00:59,243
Number 19. On the right.

503
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,492
Carlo Grimaldi,
leave a message. Thanks.

504
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,697
Good evening,
or rather, good morning.

505
01:03:41,184 --> 01:03:44,813
Carlo Grimaldi,
leave a message. Thanks.

506
01:04:13,316 --> 01:04:15,079
- Hello?
- Sir?

507
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:18,885
- Sir.
- Hello?

508
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:23,153
I called you a million times,
what the fuck?

509
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:26,660
When someone leaves a message,
you should call back.

510
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,125
Where are you?

511
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,434
Outside of your building.

512
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,340
Why?

513
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,670
I was worried.

514
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:51,519
As you can see,
I'm still in the world of the living.

515
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:53,680
Can I come up, please?

516
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,313
- No.
- Why?

517
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:57,289
I'll come down.

518
01:05:15,845 --> 01:05:19,110
What do you want from me?
Leave me alone.

519
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,348
Delete my number.

520
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:27,052
It's the third time in three weeks
that you've just shown up.

521
01:05:27,156 --> 01:05:29,522
What? You miss me?

522
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:33,490
You didn't answer,
so I got majorly anxious.

523
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,359
Majorly?

524
01:05:35,464 --> 01:05:37,398
How do you people talk?

525
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:39,730
Don't give me that "you people" shit.

526
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,964
What would you prefer I say?

527
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:45,837
I was concerned about you.
I was distressed. Is that better?

528
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,172
It doesn't fucking matter anyway.

529
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:49,369
Know what matters?

530
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:53,881
That I ran here like an idiot
because I thought you killed yourself.

531
01:05:56,352 --> 01:05:58,343
Do you feel better now?

532
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,446
Have you appeased
your girl-scout conscience?

533
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,386
Good-bye.

534
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,995
You're not going anywhere!

535
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,527
- Girl scout, my ass!
- Don't touch me.

536
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:13,398
- I came here for you.
- You're nobody to me.

537
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,134
You're full of shit.

538
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,604
Acting all stoic.

539
01:06:21,877 --> 01:06:25,005
You're all talk,
you don't have the guts to kill yourself.

540
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:28,372
You're scared, huh?

541
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:30,452
That's what you are, scared.

542
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:34,448
Get it over with.

543
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,618
This music is really great.

544
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,888
But it's making me so sleepy

545
01:08:53,996 --> 01:08:57,227
I think I'll go home and go to bed.

546
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:02,066
- I tired you out today.
- Tired me out?

547
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,163
You physically attacked me.

548
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:08,942
You deserved it.

549
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,378
Who else will be there?

550
01:10:29,658 --> 01:10:31,990
It's not that I don't feel like it.

551
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,425
I'll call you later, bye.

552
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:45,640
Dad?

553
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:52,242
Maybe I'll move back to Rome.

554
01:10:52,348 --> 01:10:54,646
It's up to you, your room is there.

555
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:03,449
- You're early.
- You're crazy.

556
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,356
The wet suit keeps me warm.

557
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,897
- Hi, Bella!
- Hurry up, they're waiting for us.

558
01:11:08,998 --> 01:11:11,990
- What's that thing?
- You'll see.

559
01:11:15,337 --> 01:11:17,271
Can I leave her in your yard?

560
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:18,965
Bella, wait!

561
01:11:19,675 --> 01:11:22,109
Oh, God, wait!

562
01:11:22,211 --> 01:11:24,338
- When do you leave?
- Tomorrow.

563
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,971
What a drag, you're always gone.

564
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:30,681
How's it going with Mr. WWF?

565
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,481
Whatever.

566
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,419
You met with him?

567
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,587
- Did you fuck?
- What do you think?

568
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:43,792
Does he want to leave his wife?

569
01:11:43,899 --> 01:11:47,266
Enough with the interrogation!
I don't know!

570
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:48,802
Okay, take it easy.

571
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:51,972
Sorry, I don't feel like coming anymore.

572
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,368
Why?

573
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:56,535
I'm tired.

574
01:11:57,713 --> 01:11:59,738
Tired from what?

575
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,212
Here you go.

576
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,189
Sorry!

577
01:13:50,692 --> 01:13:52,250
What are you saying?

578
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:05,903
He said he dreamt of you
last night, Honey.

579
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:08,834
Thanks.

580
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:13,338
What is it?

581
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,843
Want the window open?

582
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,445
What?

583
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,992
He wants to look out the window.

584
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:28,187
Would you help me?

585
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:29,297
There.

586
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,174
Lorenzo...

587
01:14:42,211 --> 01:14:45,612
you know we can stop at any time.

588
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:47,272
Just say the word.

589
01:14:56,992 --> 01:14:58,823
Ma'am, I don't understand him.

590
01:14:59,361 --> 01:15:01,488
Damn, was that the Lamputal?

591
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:03,360
No, the vodka.

592
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,525
It's no problem, I'll clean it up.

593
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,830
I'll move this and dry it up.

594
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,098
Mom will take care of it all.

595
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,640
I'll go get you another vodka.

596
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,232
I'll pour another glass.

597
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:18,703
- I'll pour another glass.
- No!

598
01:15:18,814 --> 01:15:21,078
- You don't want vodka?
- Do you want music?

599
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,810
What do you want?

600
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:29,947
You want us to stay with you.

601
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,288
We are with you.

602
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,684
I shouldn't have left like that.

603
01:17:14,496 --> 01:17:16,396
It's not right.

604
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:24,566
I should've waited till it was over.

605
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,673
There are rules.

606
01:17:35,584 --> 01:17:38,075
Each time I make some mistake.

607
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:44,787
We can't use certain words.

608
01:17:46,228 --> 01:17:50,324
We should never say,
"wish," or "see you later."

609
01:17:50,432 --> 01:17:54,129
We can't use future-tense verbs.

610
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:59,465
Nothing that might
remind them that after...

611
01:18:01,743 --> 01:18:04,268
We must be invisible.

612
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,981
They mustn't think we go back
to our normal life afterwards.

613
01:18:25,067 --> 01:18:27,160
He'd chosen a song.

614
01:18:28,904 --> 01:18:30,701
"Black."

615
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:36,002
A really long track,
it lasts seven minutes.

616
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:40,404
But he couldn't take it anymore.

617
01:18:40,515 --> 01:18:42,574
No more music.

618
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,481
No more vodka.

619
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:48,055
He did it all in a rush.

620
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:08,374
Nobody really wants to die.

621
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:14,239
None of the people
I assisted in these three years...

622
01:19:15,984 --> 01:19:18,316
wanted to kill themselves.

623
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,622
They want to live.

624
01:19:23,859 --> 01:19:26,054
They all want to live.

625
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,792
But they no longer can call it a life.

626
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:35,660
They can't take it anymore.

627
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:46,671
Come on, what's wrong?

628
01:20:46,775 --> 01:20:48,402
I don't feel like it.

629
01:20:51,246 --> 01:20:53,043
Shitty place.

630
01:20:53,148 --> 01:20:55,048
Not feeling well?

631
01:21:06,027 --> 01:21:07,619
You're full of shit.

632
01:21:09,931 --> 01:21:12,092
- You're fine.
- Whatever.

633
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,602
You keep lying all the time.

634
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:18,998
Nonstop bullshit.

635
01:21:19,107 --> 01:21:21,701
You don't go to Padua and never have.

636
01:21:23,678 --> 01:21:25,942
You don't have a Chinese roommate.

637
01:21:26,047 --> 01:21:28,106
You're not doing any research.

638
01:21:28,216 --> 01:21:31,208
- You know it all.
- Yes, why do you go to Mexico?

639
01:21:31,319 --> 01:21:33,719
Who do you go to see every month?

640
01:21:36,224 --> 01:21:37,953
Fucking spying on me?

641
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,857
Why do you go there every month?

642
01:21:40,962 --> 01:21:44,921
Be honest, is there someone else?

643
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:57,269
I go there to buy veterinary barbiturates.

644
01:21:58,613 --> 01:22:00,706
For putting down dogs.

645
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,951
You buy what?

646
01:22:04,653 --> 01:22:06,177
In Mexico.

647
01:22:08,156 --> 01:22:10,420
Get out, go!
You're crazy!

648
01:22:10,525 --> 01:22:12,789
- Piece of shit!
- Get out!

649
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,452
Get out of my damn car!

650
01:22:14,562 --> 01:22:17,497
Go!

651
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,864
You're nobody to me, understand?

652
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:40,906
If you need to stop for a while,
I can understand.

653
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,708
I'll hand this over to Diego.

654
01:23:46,988 --> 01:23:48,478
No.

655
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:51,591
I want to stop for good.

656
01:23:54,095 --> 01:23:56,154
I can't do it anymore.

657
01:24:24,926 --> 01:24:27,724
- Sir!
- There you are.

658
01:24:27,829 --> 01:24:32,630
I went to see the doctor,
professor, or whatever he is.

659
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:33,734
Dayal.

660
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:35,861
- I'll let you in.
- Lovely man.

661
01:24:35,970 --> 01:24:38,666
Is he a mathematician?
He offered me coffee.

662
01:24:38,773 --> 01:24:44,234
He said I shouldn't have taken a cab,
but a train, since it takes less time.

663
01:24:44,345 --> 01:24:45,903
Like you do, no?

664
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:55,846
What is this?
An excuse to see me again?

665
01:24:57,459 --> 01:25:00,553
Thanks, I would've come for it
if you'd told me.

666
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:03,495
Your ID is in there too.

667
01:25:03,598 --> 01:25:05,930
Who knew you were a scatterbrain?

668
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:09,299
- Want to come in?
- As you like.

669
01:25:12,740 --> 01:25:15,971
You never told me
you live right on the beach.

670
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:21,515
- Like it?
- Beautiful.

671
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,514
Too bright, though.

672
01:25:25,620 --> 01:25:29,920
Too much sun,
too much sea, too much wind.

673
01:25:30,458 --> 01:25:31,925
Too much.

674
01:25:32,894 --> 01:25:36,557
If it's nice, it's too nice,
if it's horrible, it's too horrible.

675
01:25:37,232 --> 01:25:39,291
I'm a bore, aren't I?

676
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:41,300
I am a bore.

677
01:25:47,742 --> 01:25:50,404
I don't have much to offer you,
want some tea?

678
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:52,673
Sure, tea is fine.

679
01:26:16,905 --> 01:26:18,930
Here's an ashtray.

680
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:29,478
What's with the sunglasses?

681
01:26:29,584 --> 01:26:32,849
I found them at home,
must've been my wife's.

682
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:40,657
Like them?

683
01:26:41,496 --> 01:26:43,589
Here, you can have them.

684
01:26:44,432 --> 01:26:46,024
Thanks.

685
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:59,706
I'll be in Rome tomorrow.
If you'd like, I could stop by.

686
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:03,841
Don't you have a boyfriend
to spend your Saturdays with?

687
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:08,818
An official boyfriend? No.

688
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:24,100
I'll smoke one last cigarette, and then
I'll be off to take this famous train.

689
01:27:28,276 --> 01:27:30,744
Enough. You should quit smoking.

690
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:32,903
Really?

691
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:35,811
Do you have a method to suggest?

692
01:27:35,917 --> 01:27:39,409
Or are you relying exclusively
on my willpower?

693
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,094
- Sir?
- Yes?

694
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:57,933
Where are you going?
It's that way.

695
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:01,436
Right, I...

696
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,337
I got confused.

697
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:06,413
Good-bye.

698
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:22,020
Don't shoot.

699
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,157
Pizza.

700
01:28:26,734 --> 01:28:28,201
Hi.

701
01:32:35,616 --> 01:32:37,481
...his longtime girlfriend

702
01:32:37,585 --> 01:32:41,578
and her super mom...

703
01:35:09,503 --> 01:35:14,497
HONEY
