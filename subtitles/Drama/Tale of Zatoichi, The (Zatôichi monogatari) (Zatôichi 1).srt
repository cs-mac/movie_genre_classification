1
00:00:51,709 --> 00:00:54,041
ZATOICHI

2
00:01:58,084 --> 00:01:59,666
Kid...

3
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,166
Bring us that blind masseur's cane.

4
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,708
We'll pay you if you succeed.

5
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:09,624
Be careful.
Do it quietly, so he won't hear.

6
00:02:27,167 --> 00:02:28,916
Thanks.

7
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,999
Scram!

8
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:34,999
Beat it, brat!

9
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,291
Ichi!

10
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,916
Even you, fooled by an innocent child!

11
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,541
Even a master is powerless
without his sword.

12
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,749
REST STOP

13
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:56,541
Drink up!

14
00:04:59,209 --> 00:05:00,874
What are you doing?

15
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,291
You were the Naruto family's clerk.
Don't you recognize us?

16
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:10,708
- The Naruto family?
- I'm the daughter!

17
00:05:39,292 --> 00:05:43,124
What now?
We already paid this month!

18
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,041
You didn't pay today!

19
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:50,624
Now you have to pay
each time we come by.

20
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:56,583
- We'll have nothing to live on.
- Stop complaining! Shut up and pay.

21
00:05:56,667 --> 00:05:59,999
Things weren't this bad
with the Funahachi gang.

22
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:03,583
- The Ginzo gang makes life hell!
- Damn you!

23
00:07:38,834 --> 00:07:42,583
This must be quite a sight!

24
00:07:42,667 --> 00:07:46,374
I'm guiding a masseur
who's carrying my vegetables.

25
00:07:49,084 --> 00:07:51,583
Wish I could see that!

26
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,666
You did me a big favor.

27
00:08:12,667 --> 00:08:14,499
Have some tea.

28
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,999
- It's hot.
- Thank you.

29
00:08:22,334 --> 00:08:28,583
Without your help,
I wouldn't have made it home.

30
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,083
Where will you sleep tonight?

31
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:39,291
Must be your first time around here.

32
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,583
You're welcome to stay here.

33
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,583
I live alone.

34
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,416
Don't get any ideas.

35
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,333
I don't have any.

36
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:13,958
- Too hard?
- No, it's just right.

37
00:09:17,584 --> 00:09:21,166
I hate thinking the town is doomed.

38
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:26,833
Ginzo and Ogi have teamed up.
They're running the town at will.

39
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:30,791
You really have such crooks?

40
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:33,666
They bully the farmers around.

41
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:37,083
And the townspeople, too.

42
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:41,749
They demand protection money
every day.

43
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:47,333
At this rate, the more we work,
the poorer we get.

44
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:51,541
You pay protection money daily?

45
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,916
Before, no.

46
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,541
We used to pay only monthly.

47
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:01,791
Big difference
between monthly and daily.

48
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,916
Exactly.

49
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,999
Are you all right?

50
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:34,041
We'll stay here a while.

51
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,624
I'll work as a bodyguard again.

52
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:40,333
You shouldn't worry about me.

53
00:10:40,417 --> 00:10:44,749
Don't do that kind of work
for my sake.

54
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,541
I'll get an official post again someday.

55
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,166
Stop worrying. You need rest.

56
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:17,749
Hey, Pops! Where's Gramps?

57
00:11:17,834 --> 00:11:21,416
He's sick in bed.
Won't be coming in today.

58
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,833
- You work him too much.
- Sorry.

59
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:27,749
Take better care of him.

60
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:32,249
- The saké is horrible as usual.
- Can't get anything better.

61
00:11:32,334 --> 00:11:35,791
Same story for ten years!

62
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:40,833
Can you hand this
to that guy over there?

63
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:43,916
I don't work for you!

64
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,333
What nerve!

65
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:52,708
Can't get it yourself?

66
00:11:52,792 --> 00:11:55,791
Drink at the counter!

67
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,208
W-w-welcome.

68
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:23,374
Welcome, my ass!
Where's this month's payment?

69
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:28,874
- Please give me more time.
- What a joke!

70
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,833
- We don't wait!
- I'll work things out.

71
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:34,999
My regards to your boss.

72
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,416
Your saké is disgusting!

73
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,499
Shut up!

74
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:52,458
What do you want?

75
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,833
Send a message to your boss.

76
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:05,958
Skilled ronin
seeks position as bodyguard.

77
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,249
Samurai...

78
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:34,541
It's late.
The Ginzo boss may not come.

79
00:14:02,834 --> 00:14:05,958
Masterless samurai,
are you the one?

80
00:14:06,042 --> 00:14:08,958
The one who seeks work
as a bodyguard?

81
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,666
Show me your skills.

82
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,458
That's very good.

83
00:14:39,917 --> 00:14:43,583
Not the cord.
Look at your foot.

84
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,583
Masseur, I'm going to the fields.

85
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:10,874
Tell me, ma'am.
Is there anything I can do to help?

86
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,416
Thank you for offering.

87
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:16,749
But I couldn't ask
a sight-impaired man to chop wood.

88
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:22,208
Don't worry. Relax.

89
00:15:42,542 --> 00:15:44,374
Dear...

90
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:50,208
You returned late last night.
Did something happen?

91
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,791
I found a good job.

92
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:00,249
Another position as a bodyguard?

93
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:04,708
I beg you, not for my sake.

94
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:09,874
I beg you, please stop taking such jobs.

95
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,416
Don't be silly.

96
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,791
With money, you could be cured.

97
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:36,708
Tell me...

98
00:16:37,209 --> 00:16:39,749
Did you hire that ronin?

99
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,291
Yes.

100
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,999
We have two problems to take care of.

101
00:16:45,917 --> 00:16:50,916
We must destroy both clans,
the Izutsu and the Funahachi.

102
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,166
Then this post town will be yours, boss.

103
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:59,874
Try not to be too rough.

104
00:16:59,959 --> 00:17:03,083
Understood. Don't worry.

105
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,208
By the way,
any news on Heihachi's murder?

106
00:17:14,209 --> 00:17:18,833
Some rumors.
They say a geisha killed him.

107
00:17:19,917 --> 00:17:23,249
That's all we know for now.

108
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:17,374
- Another bowl, masseur?
- No, thanks.

109
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:20,291
I'm full. Thank you very much.

110
00:18:23,834 --> 00:18:28,749
Ma'am, when I was chopping wood,

111
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,541
this guy ran around the house.

112
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,249
What was all that about?

113
00:18:34,334 --> 00:18:37,999
The neighbor’s son. A certified idiot.

114
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,916
Pay him no mind.

115
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,916
He dreams of being a samurai.
He runs around like that all day.

116
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,458
A samurai!

117
00:18:49,042 --> 00:18:49,999
Well...

118
00:18:51,917 --> 00:18:53,458
I'm going out a while.

119
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:57,833
- For work?
- Not exactly.

120
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,541
For this.

121
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:05,541
What? You're going gambling?

122
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,083
Better to stay away from that.

123
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:14,041
My nephew, he's addicted to gambling.

124
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:17,999
He refuses to work, plays all day.

125
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:20,208
Don't know...

126
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:22,624
He dropped out of sight.

127
00:19:22,709 --> 00:19:26,166
For me, it's just a pastime.

128
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:30,999
Some pastimes can become too serious.

129
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:52,999
What do you think?

130
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:57,083
This sword cost me a fortune.

131
00:19:57,167 --> 00:20:01,541
- Yes, Mr. Ogi, it's a fine sword.
- I'm giving it to Lord Sakai.

132
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:05,583
He'll be so pleased
that he'll do us business favors.

133
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:07,166
Of course.

134
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:12,583
Actually... try it out
on the first beggar who comes by.

135
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:15,249
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you!

136
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:18,083
Thanks, sir. But you go ahead.

137
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:20,958
Out of the question!
I won't dirty my kimono!

138
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:24,749
- You do it!
- Why not hire a ronin?

139
00:20:24,834 --> 00:20:25,791
Fool!

140
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,833
Hire a ronin just to test a sword?

141
00:20:28,917 --> 00:20:30,499
- Do as I say!
- But...

142
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:32,874
Someone's coming!

143
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,749
Slay that blind man.

144
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,999
Hurry up!

145
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,541
Scared of a blind man?

146
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:22,124
My... my sword!

147
00:21:22,209 --> 00:21:23,624
I'm so sorry!

148
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,749
You fool!

149
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:32,708
Game!

150
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,916
3 and 1, even.

151
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:45,583
New game!

152
00:21:45,667 --> 00:21:49,166
Any objections? Any objections?

153
00:21:54,917 --> 00:21:56,083
Ouch!

154
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:57,166
A blind man?

155
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,999
Sit here, blind man.

156
00:21:59,084 --> 00:22:02,124
I'm a masseur.

157
00:22:02,542 --> 00:22:04,083
Even.

158
00:22:04,167 --> 00:22:05,833
Bets are placed.

159
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:07,791
Game.

160
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:10,166
3 and 2, odd.

161
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,874
I'm out of luck.

162
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:23,749
New game.

163
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,666
Objections?

164
00:22:25,834 --> 00:22:27,999
Objections?

165
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:34,624
Odd.

166
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:43,291
- Aren't you betting?
- I'll just watch for now.

167
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:46,041
Watch? But you're blind.

168
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:48,499
1 and 1, even.

169
00:22:58,834 --> 00:23:00,916
Boss!

170
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,583
The bodyguard is here.

171
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:24,166
- Place your bets.
- Odd.

172
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,458
Even.

173
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,583
Even.

174
00:23:35,667 --> 00:23:37,249
Bets are placed.

175
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:39,333
Game.

176
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,499
4 and 2, even.

177
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:53,708
New game.

178
00:23:53,792 --> 00:23:55,583
Any objections?

179
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:57,208
Objections?

180
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:03,916
- Is that them?
- Yes.

181
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,499
Stop! Please don't!

182
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:34,166
It's done.
Mr. Ogi's worries are over for now.

183
00:25:59,834 --> 00:26:02,499
Welcome.

184
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:10,916
Some saké.

185
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,374
Yes.

186
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,958
Pops...

187
00:26:19,042 --> 00:26:21,249
Can I have more saké too?

188
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:22,833
Yes.

189
00:26:37,584 --> 00:26:39,249
Samurai...

190
00:26:41,417 --> 00:26:43,083
Masseur...

191
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:49,166
Your cane! I'm so sorry.

192
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:56,916
What a beautiful cane!

193
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:11,833
Well, masseur...

194
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:20,166
You're no ordinary masseur.

195
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,083
I smell blood on you, too.

196
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:31,791
It's a little cramped in here.

197
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,583
No use drawing your sword like that.

198
00:28:03,209 --> 00:28:04,708
Dear...

199
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:09,124
Did you have to kill again?

200
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,583
Idiot!

201
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:31,916
It's too early for this racket.

202
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,874
Go home. Battle time is over.

203
00:28:49,375 --> 00:28:53,916
The masseur didn't come home last night.

204
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,874
Maybe he got lucky.

205
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,083
Sir!

206
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,874
I'll take this to Lord Sakai.

207
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,791
Wait.

208
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:24,916
On your way back,

209
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,374
treat yourself to something tasty.

210
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,833
Thank you, sir!

211
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:20,791
Next! Kaneko Heishiro!

212
00:30:44,917 --> 00:30:48,499
Some ronin are very powerful.

213
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,374
Hattori will be the one to face them.

214
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,458
Coward!

215
00:31:56,542 --> 00:32:00,083
Using sticks isn't the art of combat!

216
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:03,749
A true samurai will use his sword!

217
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,499
You Yamaji Isaburo?

218
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,041
Yes.

219
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:26,749
And who are you?

220
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,874
Hattori Gennosuke.

221
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,874
I must slay you to regain my honor.

222
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:35,916
Get your sword!

223
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,833
Kill me, if you want.

224
00:33:41,834 --> 00:33:46,874
I don't have...
I have never had a sword.

225
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:51,374
Where is the glory...

226
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,166
in killing an invalid like me?

227
00:34:08,459 --> 00:34:11,999
Using sticks isn't the art of combat!

228
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,124
A true samurai will use his sword!

229
00:34:51,667 --> 00:34:55,208
He's as good as dead.
Not worth killing.

230
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,916
Hurry up!

231
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,416
- Why such a rush?
- Quiet! Show me what you have.

232
00:35:21,334 --> 00:35:23,791
Isn't that better?

233
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:30,333
2 and 3, odd.

234
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:43,291
New game.

235
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,041
Objections?

236
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,791
Place your bets.

237
00:35:54,125 --> 00:35:56,083
What should I bet?

238
00:35:56,167 --> 00:35:57,999
Odd.

239
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:02,958
Can I join you?

240
00:36:03,584 --> 00:36:06,666
- Odd!
- Bets are placed.

241
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,666
Game.

242
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,874
4 and 1, odd.

243
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,249
Yeah! Over here!

244
00:36:49,042 --> 00:36:52,541
Masseur, it's full of fine women.

245
00:36:55,375 --> 00:36:57,458
Sir!

246
00:36:57,542 --> 00:36:59,583
You look like a winner.

247
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:05,166
Thanks to this masseur,
I hit the jackpot.

248
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:07,916
So why not buy a night with us?

249
00:37:11,459 --> 00:37:14,583
Masseur, should we have a little fun?

250
00:37:18,209 --> 00:37:21,291
I'll talk to the madam.
I'll find five or six geishas.

251
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:26,083
I'll take care of it, young master.

252
00:37:26,167 --> 00:37:29,833
Stay here. I'll go.

253
00:37:30,834 --> 00:37:32,458
Ouch! That hurts!

254
00:37:32,542 --> 00:37:34,999
I'm not a bunny.

255
00:37:35,084 --> 00:37:36,958
Don't pull my ears!

256
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,208
No need to get violent!

257
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,666
Don't be naughty!

258
00:37:46,459 --> 00:37:49,249
So much? Impossible!

259
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:52,166
Ouch! That hurts!

260
00:37:54,959 --> 00:37:57,666
Could I stand a small needle?

261
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,249
No, the smaller the needle,

262
00:38:01,334 --> 00:38:04,958
the bigger the pain!

263
00:38:05,042 --> 00:38:07,666
Very funny! Come over here.

264
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:12,083
- Have a drink.
- Thank you.

265
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:16,083
Really funny!
See that, masseur?

266
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:19,624
I don't see much.

267
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:27,791
Osei, ready to dance?

268
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,874
Dance? Great!

269
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,083
Go on, dance!

270
00:38:39,209 --> 00:38:40,541
Miss Okinu,

271
00:38:41,542 --> 00:38:43,916
why did you loosen the strings?

272
00:38:47,125 --> 00:38:50,333
Are you after our money?

273
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,291
And you, Miss Osei.

274
00:39:00,292 --> 00:39:01,874
Aren't you a man?

275
00:39:04,959 --> 00:39:07,124
You don't smell like a woman.

276
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:13,249
The blind,
they're sensitive to such things.

277
00:39:16,959 --> 00:39:19,499
A hidden dagger?

278
00:39:20,667 --> 00:39:23,583
What's all this about?

279
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:50,083
Masseur...

280
00:39:51,084 --> 00:39:53,458
You may think I'm lying,

281
00:39:53,542 --> 00:39:56,624
but I will tell you the truth.

282
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:03,958
Our father,
he was a wealthy rice merchant.

283
00:40:19,334 --> 00:40:22,166
Come and see Cotton.

284
00:40:55,334 --> 00:40:57,666
Don't tell anyone.

285
00:41:31,209 --> 00:41:33,541
Heihachi...

286
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,624
You have endured seven long years.

287
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:44,666
- Heihachi, where is it hidden?
- This way.

288
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,708
- How many are there?
- The Naruto couple, their two children,

289
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:49,541
three maids and four clerks.

290
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:50,208
Tashichi, what did you find?

291
00:42:50,292 --> 00:42:54,374
Eight strongboxes of money.
They saved a fortune!

292
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:57,708
Inosuke, we're set for life!

293
00:42:57,792 --> 00:43:00,874
Get the Kuchinawa boss.

294
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:08,749
Did you kill everyone in the house?

295
00:43:08,834 --> 00:43:10,999
What about the kids?

296
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:14,208
They're nowhere to be found.

297
00:43:14,292 --> 00:43:15,583
Fool!

298
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:19,666
We're out of time. Let's go.

299
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,541
We tracked down Heihachi, the clerk...

300
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,958
What are you doing?

301
00:43:52,042 --> 00:43:57,208
You were the Naruto family's clerk.
Don't you recognize us?

302
00:43:58,209 --> 00:44:01,916
- The Naruto family?
- I'm the daughter!

303
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,833
As for the others, I only know names.

304
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,333
Tell me.

305
00:44:14,334 --> 00:44:17,166
Inosuke and Tashichi.

306
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:20,541
They also spoke of the Kuchinawa boss.

307
00:44:21,542 --> 00:44:23,624
That's all we know.

308
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:27,833
And you've searched all these years?

309
00:44:36,459 --> 00:44:37,958
Even.

310
00:44:39,959 --> 00:44:41,499
Wrong again!

311
00:44:44,042 --> 00:44:47,333
I'll try with my eyes closed, like him.

312
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,166
How does he do it by listening?

313
00:44:57,209 --> 00:44:59,499
I'm so unlucky!

314
00:45:08,084 --> 00:45:10,291
One rolled away!

315
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,708
That's the problem.

316
00:45:16,167 --> 00:45:17,833
Odd.

317
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:27,458
Even.

318
00:45:33,417 --> 00:45:35,249
Odd.

319
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,499
I think I got it.

320
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:45,124
My senses are sharper
with my eyes closed.

321
00:45:45,209 --> 00:45:46,458
OK!

322
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:50,166
Place your bets.

323
00:45:55,292 --> 00:45:59,791
Shinkichi! You're just
sitting with your eyes closed.

324
00:45:59,875 --> 00:46:02,083
Aren't you betting?

325
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,833
I'm listening.

326
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:10,249
What? Sitting up front just to listen?

327
00:46:11,834 --> 00:46:13,916
I have the right to listen.

328
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,458
- Are you looking for trouble?
- Don't put on airs!

329
00:46:18,542 --> 00:46:20,916
This dump needs all the clients
it can get.

330
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,124
Bastard!

331
00:46:22,209 --> 00:46:24,666
Easy, Shinkichi!

332
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:29,749
You can listen and bet at the same time.

333
00:46:30,167 --> 00:46:34,666
Calling me by my first name?
That's no way to speak to a client!

334
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,083
A client?

335
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:40,416
You used to work for me.

336
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,333
Shut up and bet!

337
00:46:43,417 --> 00:46:47,083
You asked for it.

338
00:46:49,334 --> 00:46:52,541
The last sound was...

339
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,791
OK...

340
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:03,291
Odd!

341
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:05,416
Odd.

342
00:47:06,334 --> 00:47:08,041
Game.

343
00:47:10,542 --> 00:47:13,041
4 and 2, even!

344
00:47:22,459 --> 00:47:24,333
So?

345
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:29,166
- A message for your boss.
- What?

346
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,958
Drop dead!

347
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,666
- Is Mrs. Izutsu in?
- One moment, please.

348
00:48:35,334 --> 00:48:39,708
May I ask what business you have here?

349
00:48:46,209 --> 00:48:50,083
Your dead husband has gambling debts
to my establishment.

350
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,666
- I'm taking your store.
- What?

351
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:54,791
You have three days to vacate.

352
00:48:54,875 --> 00:48:56,791
Not one day more.

353
00:48:56,875 --> 00:48:59,458
- This is madness!
- Shut up!

354
00:48:59,542 --> 00:49:01,833
Don't interfere!

355
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:22,583
See those beauties?

356
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:25,416
- Know them?
- Nope.

357
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,124
I wish! The one in red is hot.

358
00:49:36,959 --> 00:49:39,791
More saké, please.

359
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:42,999
Osei...

360
00:49:43,084 --> 00:49:46,083
Should we ask around for work?

361
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:49,999
Sir?

362
00:49:50,084 --> 00:49:52,749
Do you know a place
where we could offer our services?

363
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:54,916
Business has been slow
and we're available.

364
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,833
- Do you know of anyone?
- You should try Mr. Ogi.

365
00:49:58,917 --> 00:50:03,416
He runs everything now,
thanks to Ginzo.

366
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,083
This Mr. Ogi.
Can you introduce us to him?

367
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:11,166
Pops, give those ladies a hand.

368
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:17,208
Gramps, go and see Ogi.

369
00:50:17,292 --> 00:50:21,333
Go yourself, bastard!
Stop exploiting the old man!

370
00:50:21,417 --> 00:50:23,166
Hurry up!

371
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:29,291
Presenting "The Windmill"!

372
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,833
Watch it turn!

373
00:50:49,625 --> 00:50:51,041
Boss!

374
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,999
The tavern owner
recommends two geishas.

375
00:50:57,084 --> 00:50:58,958
They're available this evening.

376
00:50:59,042 --> 00:51:01,916
Excellent. Send them over!

377
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,749
You two, beat it!

378
00:51:04,834 --> 00:51:09,291
Lord Sakai, we'll soon be
in the company of two gorgeous women.

379
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:11,166
Hurry up.

380
00:51:15,959 --> 00:51:20,124
- What's next?
- Even.

381
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:25,249
Even!

382
00:51:25,334 --> 00:51:26,041
Bets are placed.

383
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:28,833
Game.

384
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:31,958
5 and 3, even.

385
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:33,999
A winner!

386
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,499
Watch!

387
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:09,583
Ogi!

388
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:12,083
Must I watch this much longer?

389
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:15,166
Let's have some dancing!

390
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:19,124
Show's over! Beat it!

391
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:21,333
Time to dance, girls!

392
00:52:21,417 --> 00:52:24,083
Hurry up! Dance!

393
00:52:27,584 --> 00:52:29,749
Place your bets.

394
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:38,458
Odd.

395
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:40,624
Bets are placed.

396
00:52:40,709 --> 00:52:42,166
Game.

397
00:52:43,834 --> 00:52:46,208
4 and 1, odd.

398
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:23,333
Masseur, should we bet it all?

399
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:26,374
OK.

400
00:53:33,334 --> 00:53:34,624
New game.

401
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:42,166
Objections?

402
00:53:47,125 --> 00:53:48,124
Hey!

403
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,958
The dice don't sound the same.

404
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:57,708
Damned masseur!

405
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:27,874
Master...

406
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,958
Some masseur is tearing up
the gambling house.

407
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,666
Boss wants you to go there.

408
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:42,416
A masseur?

409
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,666
Please, sir.

410
00:55:18,917 --> 00:55:22,416
- You're coming with me.
- Let me go.

411
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:25,416
- Come on.
- Do as he says!

412
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,874
Don't touch me!

413
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:07,083
You OK?

414
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:09,666
Watch your step.

415
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:12,499
Ouch!

416
00:56:13,917 --> 00:56:16,124
Be careful!

417
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,999
What are you looking at?

418
00:56:21,084 --> 00:56:23,083
Masseur...

419
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:29,416
Wait here.
I'll see what's happening.

420
00:56:33,375 --> 00:56:34,333
Ouch!

421
00:57:08,334 --> 00:57:11,958
Ladies, this way. Hurry!

422
00:57:16,792 --> 00:57:19,999
That Ogi is a horrible man!

423
00:57:20,084 --> 00:57:23,708
I hit him, and we took off
when the client tried to take Osei.

424
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,583
We ran into trouble at Ginzo's place.

425
00:57:29,667 --> 00:57:32,541
But the masseur floored them all.

426
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:37,333
It was unbelievable.
Who are you, anyway?

427
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:46,333
They'll track us down here soon.

428
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:53,541
- We should go to my aunt's house.
- Impossible. Ginzo's men are everywhere.

429
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:58,041
That's true.

430
00:58:17,917 --> 00:58:21,333
I have an idea.
Okinu, do you have some make-up?

431
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:22,249
Sure.

432
00:58:28,167 --> 00:58:30,749
Masseur, come here.

433
00:58:30,834 --> 00:58:32,624
- Don't move.
- What's that?

434
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:35,916
- I'm drawing eyes.
- Eyes for me?

435
00:58:46,834 --> 00:58:48,958
Aunt Oume!

436
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:54,083
- Who could it be at this hour?
- Open up!

437
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,333
- Who is it?
- Your nephew Shinkichi.

438
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:04,874
Shinkichi?
He must have lost everything again.

439
00:59:07,875 --> 00:59:11,416
- Come in.
- Who are these people?

440
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:13,249
Careful, masseur.

441
00:59:13,334 --> 00:59:15,624
- Masseur!
- Yes, it's me.

442
00:59:19,584 --> 00:59:21,416
Useless fools!

443
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,083
What about the bodyguard?

444
00:59:24,167 --> 00:59:29,874
It was all over by the time he arrived.
The masseur had already run off.

445
00:59:29,959 --> 00:59:36,666
- Who is this masseur?
- Don't know. Just some masseur.

446
00:59:36,750 --> 00:59:40,416
He had that punk Shinkichi with him.

447
00:59:40,959 --> 00:59:47,249
He's a regular at the joint.
He shouldn't be difficult to find.

448
00:59:47,334 --> 00:59:51,041
As for the masseur, we'll get him.

449
00:59:51,125 --> 00:59:56,708
First, we must wipe out
the Funahachi gang.

450
01:00:09,417 --> 01:00:11,666
It can't be...

451
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:19,749
We found ourselves travelling
from town to town,

452
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:24,666
tricking men and stealing their money.

453
01:00:26,917 --> 01:00:30,374
Ten years of that?

454
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:34,208
Those bandits must be living
different lives by now.

455
01:00:35,167 --> 01:00:38,833
Wait. Didn't Ogi settle here ten years ago?

456
01:00:39,334 --> 01:00:40,958
That's right.

457
01:00:41,875 --> 01:00:47,624
In fact, that Ogi...
There's something not right about him.

458
01:00:47,709 --> 01:00:53,958
I saw his arm.
He has a snake tattoo.

459
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:57,249
Wait a minute.

460
01:00:57,334 --> 01:01:02,124
Those names you mentioned...

461
01:01:02,209 --> 01:01:05,208
Something about a Kuchinawa?

462
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:09,041
Yes, that's right.

463
01:01:10,292 --> 01:01:15,874
"Kuchinawa" means "rotten rope".
And it's another name for a snake.

464
01:01:22,667 --> 01:01:25,041
Right?

465
01:01:26,834 --> 01:01:29,708
Masseur!

466
01:01:30,167 --> 01:01:33,083
Don't make those eyes at me!

467
01:01:38,959 --> 01:01:45,833
I heard about last night.
A masseur tore up your place.

468
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:47,583
That's right.

469
01:01:47,667 --> 01:01:53,541
We rushed over with the bodyguard,
but we got there too late.

470
01:01:54,542 --> 01:01:56,874
- Ogi...
- Yes?

471
01:01:58,042 --> 01:02:02,291
What were the women like?

472
01:02:03,834 --> 01:02:07,291
Lord Sakai tried to carry one away.

473
01:02:07,375 --> 01:02:11,208
But the other one hit me real hard.

474
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:16,958
Based on their moves,
they're no ordinary geishas.

475
01:02:17,042 --> 01:02:19,333
Listen...

476
01:02:20,334 --> 01:02:25,791
Find out everything you can
about that masseur and those geishas.

477
01:04:21,334 --> 01:04:24,166
- Game.
- Even.

478
01:04:24,250 --> 01:04:25,749
Odd.

479
01:04:27,459 --> 01:04:29,333
I won.

480
01:04:44,834 --> 01:04:49,499
This is my house!
Move! Go away!

481
01:05:15,334 --> 01:05:19,791
Are you still eating?
I told you to clean the house!

482
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:26,166
Little Seitaro,
the master would like to see you.

483
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,208
You, clean up that mess!

484
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,624
Come with me, Seitaro.

485
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,083
How adorable you are!

486
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,583
From now on, you'll be my boy.

487
01:06:31,584 --> 01:06:36,708
As long as you do as I say,
you and your sister can stay here.

488
01:06:39,125 --> 01:06:44,999
Would that make you happy?
I'll buy you beautiful kimonos.

489
01:06:48,584 --> 01:06:54,333
What are you doing?
Stay away from the master's room!

490
01:06:54,417 --> 01:06:56,083
No!

491
01:07:33,834 --> 01:07:35,541
Sir...

492
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:39,458
Don't you want to spend time with me?

493
01:09:08,292 --> 01:09:09,749
Osei?

494
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:13,749
It's time to practice.

495
01:12:11,334 --> 01:12:13,374
Sister?

496
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:16,541
What's wrong?

497
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,999
Sister?

498
01:12:25,334 --> 01:12:26,749
It's nothing.

499
01:12:26,834 --> 01:12:29,333
Are you all right?

500
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:51,083
Aunt, do you have an umbrella?

501
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:53,333
Over there.

502
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:58,458
I'll go see what's happening in town.

503
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:07,416
Thanks.

504
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:18,916
- Gramps, where's Pops today?
- He has other business to tend to.

505
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:21,833
That lazy bastard?

506
01:14:22,834 --> 01:14:27,249
Gramps, why do you work in this dump?
No family to care for you?

507
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:29,958
That's right.

508
01:14:30,042 --> 01:14:33,541
He took me off the streets
and gave me a job.

509
01:14:34,542 --> 01:14:40,249
He was good to me.
I'm thankful for all he did.

510
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:46,749
Better to beg than work in this dump!

511
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:51,624
Go out and sit on a straw mat
and you'll make more!

512
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:09,916
5 and 1, even.

513
01:15:17,542 --> 01:15:18,708
New game.

514
01:15:20,792 --> 01:15:22,708
Objections?

515
01:15:37,417 --> 01:15:43,749
- What are you bastards doing here?
- Pay up, if you want to gamble.

516
01:15:43,834 --> 01:15:48,124
Watch it!
This was our turf first.

517
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:51,624
You making a fuss, bastard?

518
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:02,333
You looking for trouble?

519
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:18,291
Ginzo wants a showdown.

520
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:44,333
Stay back.

521
01:17:36,959 --> 01:17:38,041
Wow!

522
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:10,249
Wait!

523
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:13,166
Wait!

524
01:18:15,792 --> 01:18:17,249
It's over.

525
01:18:36,250 --> 01:18:38,916
That masseur...

526
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:42,874
Could he be Zatoichi?

527
01:18:42,959 --> 01:18:45,666
And those geishas...

528
01:18:45,750 --> 01:18:49,499
They must be from the Naruto family.

529
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:52,916
The Naruto heist...

530
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,791
How long ago was that?

531
01:18:56,792 --> 01:18:59,166
Ten years ago.

532
01:19:00,125 --> 01:19:01,958
I see.

533
01:19:03,084 --> 01:19:09,166
If the children survived,
they would be of age by now.

534
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:13,916
I wonder...

535
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,999
That bodyguard.
Is he capable of defeating Zatoichi?

536
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:36,333
Where's Ogi?

537
01:20:10,292 --> 01:20:14,083
Boss Ginzo himself!
How nice of you to come!

538
01:20:14,167 --> 01:20:16,666
This way, please.

539
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:24,499
I hear your business is doing well.

540
01:20:24,584 --> 01:20:28,583
- I asked you never to come here.
- Don't worry.

541
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:33,208
Funahachi is history.
We run the show now.

542
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:36,916
Only thing left to do
is fill our pockets.

543
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,083
Clean this place up!

544
01:21:02,459 --> 01:21:03,749
Big news!

545
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:06,541
They wiped out the Funahachi gang.

546
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:11,916
The Ginzo gang and their bodyguard,
they slew every single one of them.

547
01:21:13,834 --> 01:21:19,291
Really, that Ginzo hired
one hell of a bodyguard!

548
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,874
Masseur, better stay away from town.

549
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:30,749
Shinkichi, is the bodyguard
really that strong?

550
01:21:30,834 --> 01:21:33,333
He's incredible.

551
01:21:34,375 --> 01:21:39,249
If he and I fought at night,
who would be stronger?

552
01:21:43,042 --> 01:21:47,791
If it's pitch black,
neither one of you would see anything.

553
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:51,041
You would probably be stronger.

554
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,666
What's so funny?

555
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:07,208
Let's see what you got.

556
01:22:07,292 --> 01:22:10,083
I'll train you. Come on!

557
01:22:10,167 --> 01:22:13,333
I'll teach you the art of combat.

558
01:22:15,250 --> 01:22:17,208
Concentrate.

559
01:22:18,209 --> 01:22:20,374
Let's begin.

560
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:24,583
Attack from any direction.

561
01:22:29,584 --> 01:22:32,083
Not all at the same time!

562
01:22:33,667 --> 01:22:37,583
Let's try again.
For safety's sake, let's plan the moves.

563
01:22:37,667 --> 01:22:39,083
Listen up.

564
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:41,333
First, me...

565
01:22:41,917 --> 01:22:43,833
Like this...

566
01:22:43,917 --> 01:22:46,708
You strike here.

567
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,333
Then...

568
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:50,958
you!

569
01:22:52,917 --> 01:22:54,416
And then you.

570
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:56,458
Good.

571
01:22:57,459 --> 01:23:00,291
Let's give it a try.

572
01:23:02,084 --> 01:23:03,499
See?

573
01:23:06,834 --> 01:23:08,333
See what you can do?

574
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,583
Now, faster.

575
01:23:14,917 --> 01:23:17,166
Good. That's it!

576
01:23:21,834 --> 01:23:24,541
Not like that!

577
01:23:27,792 --> 01:23:30,791
That hurts, idiots!

578
01:23:30,875 --> 01:23:34,874
Your lessons are over!
Assholes!

579
01:23:38,334 --> 01:23:40,624
What are you doing?

580
01:23:40,709 --> 01:23:42,708
Stupid boy! Go home.

581
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,208
- I'll have a bath.
- Me, too.

582
01:23:57,875 --> 01:23:59,791
No! Men first.

583
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,374
I am a man!

584
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,791
Masseur...

585
01:24:24,667 --> 01:24:30,041
I'm thinking of
paying Ogi another visit.

586
01:24:33,917 --> 01:24:38,541
I have to know if Ogi
was one of the bandits.

587
01:24:46,084 --> 01:24:49,458
The water's not hot enough.
Heat it up!

588
01:24:49,542 --> 01:24:52,708
Don't start! Bad enough,
taking a bath in broad daylight!

589
01:24:52,792 --> 01:24:54,416
Good-for-nothing!

590
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,333
It's no good cold.
Please, heat it up.

591
01:24:57,417 --> 01:24:59,833
That's what I'm doing!

592
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:08,874
I have to say it's incredible.

593
01:25:08,959 --> 01:25:12,791
You really look like a woman!

594
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:16,458
Does make-up make men beautiful?

595
01:25:17,209 --> 01:25:20,249
It doesn't work on everyone.

596
01:25:20,334 --> 01:25:23,166
It depends on the face!

597
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,583
Welcome...

598
01:26:11,250 --> 01:26:14,791
We would like to apologize to Mr. Ogi.

599
01:26:15,792 --> 01:26:20,416
He hired us to perform,
and we were very rude to him.

600
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,249
Really?

601
01:26:22,334 --> 01:26:25,708
Could you send him our apologies?

602
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:28,666
Have a seat.

603
01:26:29,959 --> 01:26:33,874
Ogi can't hold his liquor.
He probably forgot already.

604
01:26:33,959 --> 01:26:35,291
Don't worry.

605
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:37,916
I hope you're right.

606
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:42,749
You two haven't been around much lately.
Where have you been staying?

607
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:45,833
Mrs. Oume's place.

608
01:26:45,917 --> 01:26:47,666
Is the masseur with you?

609
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,749
Yes.

610
01:26:55,000 --> 01:26:57,499
- You all right, Gramps?
- Yes.

611
01:26:59,167 --> 01:27:01,666
Throw that out.

612
01:27:09,000 --> 01:27:11,249
Have a drink.

613
01:27:12,584 --> 01:27:13,583
Thank you.

614
01:27:13,667 --> 01:27:18,374
Ogi teamed up with Ginzo.
They must be up to something.

615
01:27:18,459 --> 01:27:23,166
But their business doesn't involve you.

616
01:27:24,167 --> 01:27:25,666
Would you like another?

617
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,583
Not yet.

618
01:27:31,667 --> 01:27:36,041
I'll go to Ogi's now.
It will take a while.

619
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:38,666
Wait here, ladies.

620
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,749
Ogi says he's not angry at all.

621
01:28:32,834 --> 01:28:36,041
He likes you two,
and wants to see you both now.

622
01:28:36,125 --> 01:28:36,958
Thank you very much.

623
01:28:37,792 --> 01:28:40,124
And thanks for the saké.

624
01:28:41,542 --> 01:28:43,916
Good luck.

625
01:28:53,959 --> 01:28:57,749
Where is everyone?

626
01:28:57,834 --> 01:29:01,624
They all went into town.

627
01:29:02,625 --> 01:29:06,458
What are you doing?

628
01:29:08,917 --> 01:29:11,749
Are you crazy?

629
01:29:11,834 --> 01:29:15,083
No. I want to be beautiful like Osei.

630
01:29:16,167 --> 01:29:17,458
What a shock!

631
01:31:04,334 --> 01:31:06,999
What's the racket?

632
01:31:07,084 --> 01:31:09,499
Back again, stupid boy?

633
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:13,416
- Where's the masseur?
- Who are you?

634
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:16,749
- We want the masseur.
- He's not here.

635
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:18,916
You can't hide him.

636
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:20,999
But he's not here.

637
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,416
Then we'll smoke him out.

638
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:26,666
Burn it down!

639
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:29,833
Stop!

640
01:31:32,584 --> 01:31:34,874
Aunt Oume! There's trouble!

641
01:31:35,542 --> 01:31:38,916
The house is on fire!
Wake up!

642
01:31:39,000 --> 01:31:41,541
There's trouble!

643
01:31:41,625 --> 01:31:42,916
Let's go!

644
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:45,999
- Hurry!
- Who are those men?

645
01:31:47,125 --> 01:31:49,291
Shinkichi!

646
01:31:57,917 --> 01:31:58,999
Damn!

647
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:26,208
She's a very beautiful woman.

648
01:33:26,292 --> 01:33:28,208
Woman?

649
01:33:29,209 --> 01:33:33,624
Things aren't always
what they seem, Inosuke.

650
01:33:33,709 --> 01:33:35,916
Don't call me by my old name.

651
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:38,749
You never know who might be listening.

652
01:33:38,834 --> 01:33:41,958
My name is Ginzo now.

653
01:33:47,709 --> 01:33:49,749
What are you looking at?

654
01:33:49,834 --> 01:33:52,083
Keep dancing!

655
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:54,666
We know everything.

656
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:58,208
You're the Naruto children!

657
01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:05,999
OK.

658
01:34:53,292 --> 01:34:56,958
- Masseur!
- Ladies, leave now.

659
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:15,041
Get the bodyguard.

660
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:59,458
Inosuke, where are you going?

661
01:36:51,917 --> 01:36:54,416
- Where's the bodyguard?
- At home.

662
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,666
Get him now!

663
01:37:37,417 --> 01:37:39,166
Give me that sword!

664
01:40:41,875 --> 01:40:44,083
Child turtle on its back.

665
01:40:44,167 --> 01:40:47,291
Grandchild turtle
on child turtle's back.

666
01:40:47,375 --> 01:40:51,416
Great-grandchild turtle
on grandchild turtle's back.

667
01:40:51,500 --> 01:40:53,291
If mother turtle falls,

668
01:40:53,375 --> 01:40:56,874
child, grandchild
and great-grandchild turtles fall, too.

669
01:41:58,667 --> 01:42:01,333
All the bandits are dead.

670
01:42:04,042 --> 01:42:07,124
Except the Kuchinawa boss.

671
01:42:08,125 --> 01:42:12,416
He must be pretty old by now.

672
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,166
He'll be dead soon enough.

673
01:42:17,167 --> 01:42:22,916
Don't think of him.
Better to think of your future.

674
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:28,374
You could settle down here.

675
01:42:29,375 --> 01:42:31,583
You could become a man again.

676
01:42:32,584 --> 01:42:35,499
This way suits me just fine.

677
01:42:40,667 --> 01:42:43,541
Where did the masseur go off to?

678
01:42:44,542 --> 01:42:47,208
He's off wandering somewhere.

679
01:42:51,209 --> 01:42:54,124
But the festival begins today.

680
01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:10,541
You found me out.

681
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,249
How did you know?

682
01:44:12,334 --> 01:44:15,124
The stench.

683
01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:20,874
Disguise yourself all you want,
your rotten stench will never go away.

684
01:44:21,667 --> 01:44:25,583
Stop blabbering, you blind bat!

685
01:44:25,667 --> 01:44:30,416
I'm proud to let it be known
that I'm the Kuchinawa boss.

686
01:44:30,500 --> 01:44:33,374
A blind man like you...

687
01:44:33,459 --> 01:44:36,458
You won't slay me easily!

688
01:44:42,084 --> 01:44:44,124
What the hell...?

689
01:44:44,209 --> 01:44:47,499
- You're not blind?
- Not at all.

690
01:44:47,584 --> 01:44:49,874
Why do you act blind?

691
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:55,958
Because the blind,
they sense people better.

692
01:46:57,167 --> 01:47:00,124
I knew you could see!

693
01:47:00,209 --> 01:47:04,083
I knew the first time you came here.

694
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:09,041
You're the one who killed my men.

695
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:13,083
Torakichi, too?

696
01:47:15,334 --> 01:47:17,833
You killed the tavern owner?

697
01:47:18,834 --> 01:47:24,291
He was just a street kid.
I took him in years ago.

698
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:31,416
I showed him the tricks of the trade
so he could become my successor.

699
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:34,333
My whole gang destroyed,

700
01:47:35,334 --> 01:47:39,166
by a wandering masseur like you!

701
01:47:41,209 --> 01:47:47,041
How did you know
I was the real Kuchinawa boss?

702
01:47:49,000 --> 01:47:54,249
When you knocked down my cane
to check out the sword.

703
01:47:54,334 --> 01:47:57,208
You're the worst crook of all.

704
01:47:58,250 --> 01:47:59,833
Is that so?

705
01:48:00,792 --> 01:48:06,833
Not much more I can do.
The time has come for me to retire.

706
01:48:06,917 --> 01:48:10,958
But I've lived a full life.

707
01:48:11,959 --> 01:48:15,374
I have no regrets.

708
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:18,624
Go on. Kill me!

709
01:48:25,834 --> 01:48:28,749
Death is too good for you.

710
01:48:28,834 --> 01:48:31,999
Finish your life as a blind man!

711
01:52:26,042 --> 01:52:28,666
Even with my eyes wide open,

712
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:31,999
I can't see a thing!
