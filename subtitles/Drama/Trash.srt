1
00:00:00,501 --> 00:00:02,450
<i>Previously on Stargate Atlantis.</i>

2
00:00:02,485 --> 00:00:04,840
They're not people.
They're machines.

3
00:00:04,875 --> 00:00:07,701
They've even built themselves
a version of Atlantis.

4
00:00:09,287 --> 00:00:11,412
The probes of your minds
uncovered the truth.

5
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:15,163
You only came to live there from
your original home, a planet called Earth.

6
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,900
Our intention is to destroy it.

7
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:21,255
They see humans as the favoured siblings
who receive all the parents' love.

8
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:23,605
They've been seeking revenge ever since.

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,834
Atlantis is under attack
from Replicators.

10
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,396
I'll be damned if I'm going to let a bunch of
replicators take our home away from us.

11
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,296
They emit a directional energy beam that
disrupts the connection between nanites.

12
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:37,600
So the Replicators literally
fall apart when you fire on 'em.

13
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:41,019
Well, we beat 'em this time,
maybe we scared them off.

14
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,376
Maybe.

15
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:48,560
Doctor Weir?

16
00:00:49,366 --> 00:00:52,056
Doctor Keller. How is
my Head of Medicine?

17
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:56,558
Uh, Acting Head of Medicine, actually, and
that's kinda what I wanted to talk to you about.

18
00:00:56,667 --> 00:00:58,219
What's up?

19
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:02,298
- I need to be replaced.
- Excuse me?

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,808
Look, after Carson

21
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,600
Someone had to step up and take over, and
I'm glad to help out, don't get me wrong. But.

22
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:13,662
I'm not qualified to run a
department of this size. You...

23
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:17,215
You need someone... better.

24
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:19,334
Everyone down there
says you're doing great.

25
00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:21,400
Well, (a) I'm not sure that's true,

26
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:25,908
and (b) it's been pretty smooth sailing over
the last few weeks. I think I've been lucky.

27
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,400
Well, the IOA are reviewing
candidates but,

28
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,814
to be honest, they're not
that great at making quick decisions.

29
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:34,113
Yeah. So, a week?
Two weeks?

30
00:01:34,148 --> 00:01:36,000
I just haven't been sleeping very well.

31
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:39,043
This whole being in control
thing kind of makes me anxious.

32
00:01:39,044 --> 00:01:41,312
Carson felt the same way
his first few months.

33
00:01:41,347 --> 00:01:43,534
I appreciate you trying to lie to me.

34
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:52,258
Look, I feel very comfortable with my life in
your hands; and at the end of the day.

35
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:54,600
That means you're
doin' a pretty good job.

36
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:58,702
Dealing with the pressure
it does get easier with time.

37
00:01:58,703 --> 00:02:02,645
Right. Uh,
how much time, exactly?

38
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:06,500
Like, it'll get easier over the next
two weeks and then you'll replace me,

39
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:09,415
so I can go back
to being a regular doctor?

40
00:02:09,416 --> 00:02:11,317
I'll keep you posted!

41
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:15,120
Thanks.

42
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:21,546
- Can I please have someone else do these?
- Performance evaluations?   - Yes.

43
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:24,500
No. Year-end employee
reviews are important.

44
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:26,800
They're how people
get promotions, and raises.

45
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:31,454
OK, look. Asking me to do performance evaluations
is ridiculous. I am the first person to admit.

46
00:02:31,454 --> 00:02:33,383
I don't know who these
people are, nor do I care to.

47
00:02:33,384 --> 00:02:35,900
Look, if you'd like, I could take
you down the hall to the labs and just

48
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:40,518
point at the people who annoy me more than
the rest, but that's about as useful as I get.

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,650
- All done.
- Oh, of course !

50
00:02:43,685 --> 00:02:44,920
That was quick!

51
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:50,650
Hey, John, wait a minute. You've just given
everyone excellent and above averages.

52
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,500
- Ooh! Can I do that?
- No!

53
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:54,950
I know this is not the most
glamorous part of your job

54
00:02:54,951 --> 00:02:57,100
but you are in
leadership positions and,

55
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:00,701
unfortunately, that comes
with administrative responsibilities.

56
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,540
Well, everybody who works for
me is excellent and above average.

57
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:07,158
You want me to lie? `Cause I don't
think leaders should lie, Elizabeth.

58
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,595
- Doctor Weir?
- Yes, Chuck?

59
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,765
The Apollo just came out of hyperspace.

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,351
They're ahead of schedule.

61
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:18,681
Probably just tryin' to show off you know,
bein' a new ship an' all.

62
00:03:18,873 --> 00:03:21,753
Colonel Ellis, you've made excellent
time on your first voyage here.

63
00:03:21,788 --> 00:03:25,200
- Thank you. I'm beaming down now.
- Very well. We'll meet ...

64
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:31,472
Set up in the Conference Room.

65
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:32,806
Doctor.

66
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,707
- Colonel. Welcome.
- Thank you.

67
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:39,000
Colonel Sheppard, Doctor McKay.

68
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:42,198
This is gonna make things easier.
I'll need to brief you all immediately.

69
00:03:42,233 --> 00:03:46,857
- What's going on?
- Well, I'd prefer to talk in private.

70
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,500
Ever since the human-form
Replicators made a play for the city.

71
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:03,486
We've had the Daedalus make regular
reconnaissance fly-bys of their home planet.

72
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:08,004
- Yes, we know.
- Two months ago, it took these pictures.

73
00:04:09,572 --> 00:04:11,928
I'm sorry, what am I supposed
to be looking at here?

74
00:04:11,963 --> 00:04:14,673
- Nothing.
- Excuse me?

75
00:04:15,926 --> 00:04:22,498
This image was taken about three
weeks ago in the very same location.

76
00:04:22,533 --> 00:04:27,434
- They're building ships a lot of them.
- Why weren't we made aware of this?

77
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:29,389
I'm making you aware of it now.

78
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:33,395
Well, if they're coming for us, we should start making
preparations to bolster the shield. I mean, we should...

79
00:04:33,395 --> 00:04:35,004
They're not gonna get here.

80
00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:40,253
I'm here to inform you that in precisely
twelve hours, the Apollo in consort with your team.

81
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:45,500
Will launch a surgical strike
on the Replicator planet.

82

http://projet-sg.net

105
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:55,735
- So, uh, you're gonna blow up their ships.
- That's right.

106
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,679
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

107
00:05:57,714 --> 00:05:59,337
How the hell do
you plan on doing that?

108
00:05:59,372 --> 00:06:01,700
A set of Mark Nine tactical nukes

109
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,932
housed in a custom-made
weapons platform codenamed Horizon.

110
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:07,153
How many nukes do you have?

111
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:10,300
The Horizon carries six warheads
and four decoys.

112
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:13,333
I'm gonna need you to do a final
inspection before we head out.

113
00:06:13,334 --> 00:06:15,901
- Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, wait. Six?
- That's right.

114
00:06:15,936 --> 00:06:21,913
- That's not enough.   -  The Replicators are
self-replicating robots, which means that they can...

115
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:25,808
I'm aware of that, thank you, Doctor, but
they're not like the Milky Way Replicators.

116
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:27,800
Their ships aren't built from nano-cells.

117
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:31,485
They're constructed of real material
that can be destroyed.

118
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,589
Six will be more than enough for now.

119
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:36,800
"For now"? Look, isn't this a bit
like poking a sleeping dragon?

120
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:40,456
Why don't we just wait `til
Area 51 finishes the PWARWs?

121
00:06:40,457 --> 00:06:43,600
- Which one's that, again?
- Planetary-Wide Anti-Replicator Weapons.

122
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:47,975
Look, the Asgard were capable of creating a satellite
that could wipe out an entire Replicator planet.

123
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,100
I mean, we've had some
trouble making one of our own but.

124
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:55,712
Look, would I prefer taking out
an entire planet at once? Absolutely.

125
00:06:55,713 --> 00:06:59,200
But this image is giving
the IOA a lot of sleepless nights.

126
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:04,376
The Replicators know the location of Earth and,
with these new ships, have the means to get there.

127
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:09,704
We can't just sit on our hands while the guys
at Area 51 try to come up with a solution.

128
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:15,564
This mission's primary objective
is to eliminate key military targets.

129
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,200
We'll come back and finish once
the new weapon is up and running.

130
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:21,700
Doctor, I'm gonna need you to start
your inspections as soon as possible.

131
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:24,540
- Well, yes, sure. I just...
- Doctor McKay is ready to beam.

132
00:07:24,575 --> 00:07:26,508
Well, he's not, actually...

133
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:30,800
OK.

134
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,000
We're finished here.

135
00:07:35,851 --> 00:07:36,923
Thank you.

136
00:07:41,448 --> 00:07:45,268
- Can you believe this?
- No.

137
00:07:45,303 --> 00:07:48,061
It all seems too good to be true.

138
00:07:48,574 --> 00:07:49,678
What?!

139
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:53,307
Well, if those nukes do
what Ellis says they do...

140
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:57,800
Since we won back the city, we haven't
heard so much as a peep from the Replicators.

141
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,897
Well, obviously
they haven't gone away.

142
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,370
No, but maybe they've decided that
we are more trouble than we're worth.

143
00:08:03,405 --> 00:08:06,790
That the threat of our AR weapons
is enough to keep them at bay.

144
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,310
You don't build that many ships
to make a run at Atlantis.

145
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:14,631
They're headed for Earth.

146
00:08:21,013 --> 00:08:22,300
Colonel.

147
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:26,211
- May I have a word?
- Sure.

148
00:08:32,844 --> 00:08:36,680
- This mission is a mistake.
- It most certainly is not.

149
00:08:36,715 --> 00:08:41,065
It is an ineffectual first strike. You've gotta
know how dangerous that could be for us.

150
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,184
All due respect, Doctor, it won't be ineffectual.
Besides, the IOA doesn't think we can wait.

151
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,500
I think we should stall them
try to open a round of negotiations.

152
00:08:49,535 --> 00:08:53,560
They're not a race of people.
They're a weapon. Try to keep that in mind.

153
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:55,600
Weapon or not, they're sentient.

154
00:08:55,601 --> 00:09:00,362
Negotiating with them could buy us
enough time to get the PWARW up and running.

155
00:09:00,554 --> 00:09:05,100
Usually I'd be more than happy to go twelve
rounds here about who's right and who's wrong,

156
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:06,263
but it wouldn't matter.

157
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:09,800
I have my orders, and you don't have
the authority to tell me to stand down,

158
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:14,235
so, again, with all due respect, ma'am,

159
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:16,674
I have a mission to execute.

160
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:31,179
Well, the specs check out. We've loaded
the target information. They're ready.

161
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:36,141
Yeah. It's good to go.
This is a bad idea, isn't it?

162
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:38,600
We could tell them
they're not ready you know,

163
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:40,898
there's a fault with the guidance
system or something.

164
00:09:40,933 --> 00:09:44,773
I thought about that. They're gonna have guys
here to contradict us pretty quickly.

165
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:49,886
Yep. But we're here alone. We could
make them not ready.

166
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:55,641
They're building an armada, Radek.
I saw them. They showed me the pictures.

167
00:09:56,193 --> 00:10:00,332
I'd feel pretty stupid if we break this thing, only
to have the Replicators show up and destroy the city.

168
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:04,400
Yeah. Yeah,
that would be bad.

169
00:10:07,284 --> 00:10:09,287
Tell the Colonel we're good to go.

170
00:10:13,267 --> 00:10:15,200
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:23,500
- Colonel Ellis has asked me
to join the mission.   - I know.

172
00:10:24,286 --> 00:10:27,600
I was gonna stay behind in a cloaked
Jumper after they launch the warheads;

173
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,294
do some battle damage assessment.

174
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,400
I know that too.

175
00:10:32,135 --> 00:10:36,548
He told me that you called Woolsey and General O'Neill
and tried to get the whole thing called off.

176
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:39,363
- Yes, I did.
- They didn't bite.

177
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:41,068
They did not.

178
00:10:42,097 --> 00:10:47,267
- Look, I know you think we're doing
the wrong thing here, but, uh...   - John...

179
00:10:49,486 --> 00:10:51,800
Good luck.

180
00:11:03,401 --> 00:11:03,902
<i>Alright.
Horizon is online.</i>

181
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:06,112
Alright.
Horizon is online.

182
00:11:06,401 --> 00:11:11,534
The warheads are armed and we
are ready for final sequencing

183
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:14,000
- as soon as we drop out of hyperspace.
- Start now.

184
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:15,016
<i>- as soon as we drop out of hyperspace.
- Start now.</i>

185
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:16,600
- Open the bomb bay doors.
- We're still in hyperspace.

186
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:17,996
<i>- Open the bomb bay doors.
- We're still in hyperspace.</i>

187
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:20,900
We're coming out of our jump
uncomfortably close to the planet.

188
00:11:20,901 --> 00:11:23,714
I don't wanna waste
any time. Just get it done.

189
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,688
Well, you're the boss.

190
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,700
Ready to launch
on your command.

191
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:45,543
You're sure about this, right?
I mean, like, this is the right thing to do?

192
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:48,471
Not the best time for
that kind of talk, Doctor.

193
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:50,689
Right. Sorry.

194
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,500
<i>Coming out of hyperspace in
five, four, three, two, one.</i>

195
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:56,100
Coming out of hyperspace in
five, four, three, two, one.

196
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,344
Launch the Horizon.

197
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,200
We have detonation confirmation
on all six warheads.

198
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,071
<i>We have detonation confirmation
on all six warheads.</i>

199
00:13:28,072 --> 00:13:31,362
- Sheppard, you have a go for launch.
- Copy that.

200
00:13:35,849 --> 00:13:38,200
<i>- Clear. Jump away. - Very well. We'll
pick you up in an hour. Pull us out of here.</i>

201
00:13:38,201 --> 00:13:41,124
- Clear. Jump away. - Very well. We'll
pick you up in an hour. Pull us out of here.

202
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:56,200
There is so much
radiation interference,

203
00:13:56,201 --> 00:13:59,047
it's hard to get an accurate yield
calculation from the scan telemetry.

204
00:13:59,048 --> 00:14:02,200
Please, there is more than enough data. It's not
like we're trying to take out a person here.

205
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:04,781
We're taking out massive chunks of a city.

206
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:08,384
Someone just please tell me
if we hit our targets or not.

207
00:14:08,385 --> 00:14:10,307
If this data is right,

208
00:14:10,706 --> 00:14:14,766
then all of your primaries and most of your
secondaries have been incinerated.

209
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:16,036
Excellent.

210
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:25,462
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

211
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:28,528
- I hear congratulations are in order.
- Yeah, you heard right.

212
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,894
- How was the mission? Was it a success?
- We did get all the ships.

213
00:14:32,895 --> 00:14:34,515
I wish I could've been there to see it.

214
00:14:34,516 --> 00:14:38,463
Well, space battles are always a lot more
exciting on TV than they are in real life.

215
00:14:38,464 --> 00:14:44,022
Doctor Weir? You're gonna wanna see this.
We've got a contact.

216
00:14:44,182 --> 00:14:46,989
- Just came out of hyperspace.
- Is it broadcasting IFF?

217
00:14:47,006 --> 00:14:48,634
- No, ma'am.
- Wraith?

218
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,644
Naah. It's very small. I doubt it.

219
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:55,165
- Raise the shield.   - It's taking up
a geosynchronous orbit above the city.

220
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,482
What is it?

221
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,034
Maybe we should have
the Apollo check it out.

222
00:15:00,294 --> 00:15:03,048
Tell the Colonel he needs
to get back to his ship.

223
00:15:22,104 --> 00:15:23,992
- Right ahead of us, sir.
- Shields?

224
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:25,950
Affirmative. Shields are up.

225
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:31,200
<i>OK, I've got a visual. Looks
like a satellite of some sort.</i>

226
00:15:31,201 --> 00:15:33,937
OK, I've got a visual. Looks
like a satellite of some sort.

227
00:15:43,934 --> 00:15:46,654
- It's a Stargate!
- A Stargate?

228
00:15:46,914 --> 00:15:48,075
<i>That's right.</i>

229
00:15:48,801 --> 00:15:50,700
I thought you said
it was a satellite.

230
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:51,600
<i>It's both. It's a satellite, but
in the middle there's a... Stargate.</i>

231
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:55,400
It's both. It's a satellite, but
in the middle there's a... Stargate.

232
00:15:55,782 --> 00:15:58,712
- What could be the purpose of that?
- I've no idea.

233
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:03,300
- It just activated.
- The Gate?!

234
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:04,400
<i>- It just activated.
- The Gate?!</i>

235
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,376
Get us away from it!

236
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,494
Sir, the satellite is turning again.

237
00:16:21,804 --> 00:16:23,259
It's hitting the planet.

238
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:38,505
- It's a sustained beam.
- That is bad for a dozen different reasons.

239
00:16:46,301 --> 00:16:47,800
It's protected by a shield.
Give me some options, McKay.

240
00:16:47,801 --> 00:16:49,715
<i>It's protected by a shield.
Give me some options, McKay.</i>

241
00:16:49,716 --> 00:16:52,141
The shield's taking
its power from the beam.

242
00:16:52,142 --> 00:16:54,400
Look, I registered a slight drop
in output when you fired on it.

243
00:16:54,401 --> 00:16:56,281
<i>Could I get a nuke past its shield?</i>

244
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:57,633
No, probably not.

245
00:16:57,634 --> 00:17:00,400
I'll get in the Chair and give it everything
we've got. Maybe that'll collapse the shield.

246
00:17:00,401 --> 00:17:02,800
I said "slight" as
in point zero zero two. Look,

247
00:17:02,801 --> 00:17:05,896
I doubt any amount of firepower is gonna
collapse it while that beam is active.

248
00:17:05,897 --> 00:17:07,100
- Then what do we do?   - We stand down
and let me think, is what we do.

249
00:17:07,101 --> 00:17:09,153
<i>- Then what do we do?   - We stand down
and let me think, is what we do.</i>

250
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,200
- Just give me five minutes to get my bearings.
I'll brief you.   - McKay, it's shooting at us.

251
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,200
<i>- Just give me five minutes to get my bearings.
I'll brief you.   - McKay, it's shooting at us.</i>

252
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,800
Yes, and the shields are holding.

253
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:17,503
Look, we've got plenty
of time... just give me five minutes.

254
00:17:30,947 --> 00:17:33,700
- What've you got?
- We're in trouble.

255
00:17:33,701 --> 00:17:37,062
It took you five minutes to figure that out?
You're slippin', buddy.

256
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:39,700
Look, the satellite is basically
just a stripped-down ship.

257
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:42,485
There's a hyperdrive engine,
a shield, and navigational systems.

258
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:45,800
There's a small power source that was
designed to take it to its intended target

259
00:17:45,801 --> 00:17:47,900
and power the shield
until the Gate can be dialled.

260
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:51,100
But once a wormhole has been established
to whoever's on the dialling side,

261
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:54,265
it fires a beam into their Stargate
and it comes out on our side,

262
00:17:54,266 --> 00:17:57,140
allowing them to fire on us
and to power the satellite.

263
00:17:57,141 --> 00:17:58,475
That's very clever.

264
00:17:58,476 --> 00:18:01,300
Yes. As long as they can keep
the beam powered from home,

265
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:02,962
the weapon remains operational.

266
00:18:02,963 --> 00:18:08,436
Oh, and one fun added side bonus is that because
their Stargate is in such close proximity to our planet,

267
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:12,195
- we can't dial our Stargate. We're stuck.
- Maybe that's a good thing.

268
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,059
The beam'll turn off at the end of
the Gate's thirty-eight minute cycle.

269
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,887
If we dial our Gate at that precise moment,
we can neutralise theirs.

270
00:18:19,888 --> 00:18:23,455
What, and if it's not pulling power
from the beam any more,

271
00:18:23,456 --> 00:18:25,600
then we can collapse
its shield and destroy it.

272
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:29,207
Sure. The problem is, I don't think it's gonna
shut down in thirty-eight minutes.

273
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:33,747
But I thought it was physically impossible for
an artificial wormhole to stay open any longer.

274
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,600
There is one exception to that rule.

275
00:18:35,601 --> 00:18:38,835
The SGC has encountered attacks
of this kind on their own Stargate

276
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:42,000
and sadly we've discovered that
if you pump enough energy into it,

277
00:18:42,001 --> 00:18:44,210
a Stargate can remain active indefinitely.

278
00:18:44,211 --> 00:18:47,200
That would require an insane
amount of power, wouldn't it?

279
00:18:47,201 --> 00:18:50,204
Like a black hole, or
an unlimited number of ZPMs.

280
00:18:50,205 --> 00:18:53,842
- So we can assume the Replicators
are behind this. - Well, I hope so.

281
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:57,635
- You hope so? - Well, otherwise, we've
discovered yet another super-powerful enemy.

282
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,615
If it is a normal Stargate, can we
still contact the dialling planet?

283
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:05,067
Well, I'll need to boost the signal considerably
to get through the interference, but, uh, yes.

284
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:07,204
- See what you can do, please.
- Right.

285
00:19:07,995 --> 00:19:11,166
- Why would you wanna contact them?
- To negotiate.

286
00:19:11,564 --> 00:19:15,064
It's a waste of energy. We need to
figure out how to destroy it.

287
00:19:15,341 --> 00:19:18,390
I'd love to go twelve rounds here
about who's right and who's wrong,

288
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:21,500
but at the end of the day I'm responsible
for the well-being of this city,

289
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:25,267
and you don't have the authority
to tell me to stand down.

290
00:19:25,268 --> 00:19:29,500
So with all due respect,
I think I'll place my call.

291
00:19:36,373 --> 00:19:39,630
Alright.
I think I've got it.

292
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,021
They're responding
to the transmission.

293
00:19:43,961 --> 00:19:45,400
- Oberoth!
- Doctor Weir.

294
00:19:45,401 --> 00:19:46,732
<i>- Oberoth!
- Doctor Weir.</i>

295
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,950
I must say I'm surprised
to see you.

296
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:53,628
<i>Each of us exists within the collective
and can be replicated many times.</i>

297
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:55,900
- You need to disable your weapon
immediately.   - That is not possible.

298
00:19:55,901 --> 00:19:57,249
<i>- You need to disable your weapon
immediately.   - That is not possible.</i>

299
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,800
We had no choice but to attack you.
You're building warships.

300
00:19:59,801 --> 00:20:01,300
- They need to be neutralised.
- And now, so do you.

301
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:03,500
<i>- They need to be neutralised.
- And now, so do you.</i>

302
00:20:03,501 --> 00:20:08,700
That assault was just the tip of the spear.
We were hoping it would bring you to your senses.

303
00:20:08,701 --> 00:20:13,100
If you don't stop this aggression,
we will be forced to launch an all-out attack.

304
00:20:13,101 --> 00:20:16,100
<i>Really? Why have you waited?</i>

305
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:19,900
The annihilation of
your people is not our goal.

306
00:20:19,901 --> 00:20:22,200
Ideally, we would like
a peace to exist between us,

307
00:20:22,201 --> 00:20:26,600
but we will not stand idly by while you build ships
and weapons that can be used to destroy us.

308
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:30,000
<i>Interesting. We feel
the same way about you.</i>

309
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:34,700
Perhaps I should remind you every time we've
met in battle, our side has been clearly victorious.

310
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:37,500
Elizabeth. They're attempting to upload
a virus on the comm bandwidth.

311
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:40,700
- I've been able to stop it for now but I'm not...
- Shut it down.

312
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:48,000
- Well, that went well!
- Yeah. Always been one of my favourites.

313
00:20:48,401 --> 00:20:52,300
What if the Gate doesn't shut down
at the end of its thirty-eight minute cycle?

314
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,700
Look, if they're able to maintain
the energy beam's intensity,

315
00:20:55,701 --> 00:20:59,400
- which I'm sure they will...
- And how long `til our shield fails?

316
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,700
It's twenty-nine hours.

317
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,300
Well, it was worth a shot.

318
00:21:22,301 --> 00:21:27,000
- Alright, we're gonna need another plan.
- Yeah, OK.

319
00:21:29,401 --> 00:21:31,700
<i>Look, stop dialling.
It's not working.</i>

320
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:34,000
Sir.

321
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,300
You two give us a minute.

322
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:41,000
What can I do for you, John?

323
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,900
We need to head back
to the Replicator planet.

324
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:49,000
- We do, do we?   - Yeah. If this satellite
weapon is powered by its homeworld,

325
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,600
maybe we can neutralise
it at the source.

326
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,800
Well, the Apollo is in no condition
to get in a battle right now.

327
00:21:54,801 --> 00:21:58,300
- That beam took a lot out of our shield.
- No, we've gotta do something.

328
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:03,500
- We did do something.   - I'm sorry, sir, but I can't
help but think that we're somehow responsible for this.

329
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:06,700
- Why, because Weir said so?
- No, sir.

330
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,900
John, listen to me.
I, uh,

331
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:11,900
I've been over your record.

332
00:22:11,901 --> 00:22:17,000
I know you have your detractors but personally
I think you've done a hell of a job here.

333
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:21,200
- Thank you, sir.
- You should be running Atlantis, not Doctor Weir.

334
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:27,800
Then I'd be The Man, and who
would I have to rage against?

335
00:22:28,101 --> 00:22:34,500
Listen. Because of us, Earth won't have
to deal with an armada of Replicator ships,

336
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:40,000
so whatever happens here,
we did the right thing today.

337
00:22:42,501 --> 00:22:43,150
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

338
00:22:43,151 --> 00:22:44,100
I'm sorry.

339
00:22:44,101 --> 00:22:46,750
It's just...
they didn't even consult me.

340
00:22:46,751 --> 00:22:49,700
I imagine they felt the need
for secrecy was great.

341
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:54,000
I have the highest level of
clearance humanly possible, Teyla. No.

342
00:22:54,001 --> 00:22:56,900
Tthey're trying to undermine me.
Some of the military doesn't like

343
00:22:56,901 --> 00:23:00,100
that a civilian, let alone a woman,
is in charge of this city.

344
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:02,400
Surely General O'Neill
doesn't feel that way.

345
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:05,200
And the IOA, they've backed you
several times. They believe in you.

346
00:23:05,201 --> 00:23:09,000
Yes, when things are going well, but
as soon as we run into a major problem,

347
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:12,400
the military steps in
and assumes absolute control.

348
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:17,900
- Certainly you don't wish to coordinate military
attacks.   - No, and that's not what I'm saying. Look,

349
00:23:17,901 --> 00:23:22,200
our current situation could have easily
been avoided. I told them as much,

350
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:26,700
but they put next to no weight behind my opinions
regarding the safety and protection of this city.

351
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:30,800
Yes, the IOA is happy
to have me as lead administrator,

352
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:34,500
but when it comes to the big decisions...

353
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:41,300
If we get out of this, I think
I may have to step down.

354
00:23:41,301 --> 00:23:44,150
Give it some time. You need
to step back and...

355
00:23:44,151 --> 00:23:46,600
<i>We've got something.</i>

356
00:23:55,301 --> 00:23:57,500
We were throwing some ideas
back and forth... well,

357
00:23:57,501 --> 00:23:59,300
he was throwing them forth
and I was throwing them back

358
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:02,700
and while he was droning on about some idea that
might have worked, it suddenly occurred to me:

359
00:24:02,801 --> 00:24:05,500
this city has encountered problems
like this before, so I...

360
00:24:05,501 --> 00:24:08,200
We don't need the history
of your idea, Doctor.

361
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll let that be a surprise when I read
your autobiography. Just tell me the plan.

362
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:16,400
- We submerge it.
- I'm sorry?

363
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:21,101
-We submerge the city.   - I thought you said
we couldn't submerge the city.

364
00:24:21,102 --> 00:24:24,900
That was two years ago before the Ancients came
and activated a number of new systems. See...

365
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:29,700
- The "how" is complicated, but I think it's possible.
Look, it's not a permanent solution... - but

366
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:33,100
- it'll buy us enough time
`til we come up with one.   - Exactly.

367
00:24:33,101 --> 00:24:35,300
- How much time?
- Some. As much as a week.

368
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:37,000
I don't understand. Why?

369
00:24:37,001 --> 00:24:39,600
Ah, you see, the history part
would have made that a lot clearer.

370
00:24:39,601 --> 00:24:43,700
- Had you been a little more patient, I would
have painted you a picture of...   - McKay.

371
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,250
Ten thousand years ago when the Ancients
were under siege from the Wraith,

372
00:24:48,251 --> 00:24:52,300
they sank the city in order to dissipate
the Wraiths' energy blasts in the water.

373
00:24:52,301 --> 00:24:56,900
This way, the shield was able to hold far longer
than it ever could on the surface. So, now,

374
00:24:56,901 --> 00:25:01,800
we submerge the city. The water attenuates the
satellite's beam intensity, buys us some more shield time.

375
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,650
We cannot predict how much
the Replicators' beam will be attenuated.

376
00:25:04,651 --> 00:25:07,800
- It might not buy us any time at all.
- There's no way to know for sure, yes,

377
00:25:07,801 --> 00:25:09,100
but it's not a reason not to try.

378
00:25:09,101 --> 00:25:12,600
- Alright, get it done.
- Yeah, I don't think that's your call.

379
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:17,800
Worst case scenario?
We lose some power from the ZPM?

380
00:25:17,801 --> 00:25:20,100
Oh, no – worst case scenario is that
we've both read the numbers wrong,

381
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:22,600
we use up a ton of power and
the city doesn't submerge at all.

382
00:25:22,601 --> 00:25:27,300
Look, as much as I hate to say it,
Zelenka's not infallible.

383
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:32,400
Still, I agree. It's worth the risk.

384
00:25:33,151 --> 00:25:36,200
Alright. The city has an automatic
submersion subroutine already in the system.

385
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:43,400
I'll need it to tweak it a bit to work with one ZPM
and disable some safety protocols. Give me an hour.

386
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,200
- It's been an hour.
- We're ready.

387
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:05,000
- No... you've got to do the, um...
- Oh, just, um...

388
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:10,500
- We are ready.
- Good.

389
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:12,700
Give me city-wide.

390
00:26:14,901 --> 00:26:19,500
Attention all personnel. We are about
to attempt to submerge the city.

391
00:26:19,501 --> 00:26:22,800
From what I understand,
it could get a little bumpy,

392
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:28,600
so this is your last chance to secure equipment
and get to the designated safe areas.

393
00:26:28,902 --> 00:26:34,400
- We've come full circle, eh?
- Yeah. Feels that way.

394
00:26:35,101 --> 00:26:38,900
OK. Take us down.

395
00:26:38,901 --> 00:26:42,700
Aye, aye, Captain. Shall we?

396
00:27:45,101 --> 00:27:47,700
That's it. We're down.

397
00:27:47,701 --> 00:27:51,700
- The beam still looks pretty serious, Rodney.
- Yeah, I know. Just give me a second to...

398
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:54,200
- Crap!
- I told you.

399
00:27:54,201 --> 00:27:57,200
- Thank you, Radek. Very helpful.
- What is it?

400
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:00,300
The beam is breaking through the water
much more efficiently than we thought.

401
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:04,400
- The water has no effect?   - It's having an effect
but just nowhere near what we wanted to. Look,

402
00:28:04,401 --> 00:28:10,500
- that plan took us three hours to execute and
bought us an additional... ten hours.   - Nine.

403
00:28:11,201 --> 00:28:13,200
Nine.

404
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:17,800
OK. What's the plan?

405
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:23,300
That was the plan.

406
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:35,400
I need to learn some science.

407
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:37,300
What for?

408
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,000
I'm not all that useful
in situations like these.

409
00:28:41,001 --> 00:28:47,400
If we get into a fight, or we need to break out
of somewhere, you know, kill someone, I'm your man;

410
00:28:47,401 --> 00:28:52,100
but a laser attacking the city's shield,
I don't know where to chip in.

411
00:28:52,101 --> 00:28:57,300
Well, that's why we're a team,
like the Fantastic Four.

412
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:03,000
It's a comic book where superheroes
fight crime and stuff.

413
00:29:04,001 --> 00:29:07,400
See, I'd be Mr Fantastic;
Ronon would be The Thing;

414
00:29:07,401 --> 00:29:11,200
McKay would be the Human Torch...
you'd be the Invisible Woman.

415
00:29:11,201 --> 00:29:13,400
I am not invisible.

416
00:29:14,101 --> 00:29:19,600
- No. No, and McKay's not a human torch.
- Well, how come you get to be Mr Fantastic?

417
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:22,000
Because he was the leader and I'm the...

418
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:32,000
I'm just saying that they were a cool team and we're a
cool team and they use their strengths to, you know...

419
00:29:34,201 --> 00:29:37,300
I'm gonna go check on McKay.

420
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,500
Shouldn't you guys be
bickering or something?

421
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:52,000
Ah, we've got nothing to bicker about.
He's run out of bad ideas... finally.

422
00:29:52,001 --> 00:29:54,500
If we survive this,
I'm putting in for a transfer.

423
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,400
Oh, please. We both know that
you've done your best work under me.

424
00:29:57,401 --> 00:30:02,300
- Under you?! I'm my own department head, you know.
- Please! We both know that department is a joke.

425
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,600
Why don't you two guys just
make out and get it over with, huh?

426
00:30:05,601 --> 00:30:11,001
I mean, we have, what? Under one day to figure out
how not to get destroyed by this satellite thing,

427
00:30:11,002 --> 00:30:13,800
and you guys are arguing
about who works for who.

428
00:30:13,801 --> 00:30:16,000
Every possible scenario ends in failure.

429
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:21,000
There is nowhere on the face of
this planet that that thing cannot kill us.

430
00:30:24,001 --> 00:30:25,900
- You don't think...?
- No.

431
00:30:25,901 --> 00:30:27,100
Old girl too banged up?

432
00:30:27,101 --> 00:30:30,400
No, the Replicators fixed all the damage we did
with the drones. We just don't have the power.

433
00:30:30,401 --> 00:30:34,500
- Yeah, but ideally...
- it may be the only way.   - What?

434
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:38,000
The drilling platform. You guys
have it operational down there, right?

435
00:30:38,001 --> 00:30:41,200
- Close enough, but we couldn't bring it with us.
- Bring it where?

436
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:44,500
- We don't need to. We just need a boost.
- You might be onto something here.

437
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:46,700
Hey! What's your idea?! Hey!

438
00:30:50,001 --> 00:30:52,700
Well, luckily the
umbilical's already in place.

439
00:30:52,701 --> 00:30:56,600
<i>Yes, I know. Look, are you capable of
outputting the power we need or not?</i>

440
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,450
We just started drilling into the crust.

441
00:30:58,451 --> 00:31:00,200
<i>I can get you nine
percent of the way there.</i>

442
00:31:00,201 --> 00:31:03,400
- There goes that plan.
- Can't the ZPM make up the difference?

443
00:31:03,401 --> 00:31:07,400
Ah, no. The ZedPM's a little busy
powering the shield at max.

444
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,800
What if it didn't have to?

445
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:15,400
What if we could take the strain
off the shield momentarily?

446
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:18,600
Well, we'd need about a minute.
Why? What do you have in mind?

447
00:31:19,001 --> 00:31:21,500
Lantea's moon has some 
sizeable satellites itself.

448
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:25,300
Asteroid-like chunks we think are left over
from a second moon that no longer exists.

449
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:30,700
I'd like you to beam up Lorne and get a flight
of F-302s close enough to nudge one our way.

450
00:31:30,701 --> 00:31:35,200
You wanna bring an asteroid
towards us? Is that wise?

451
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:37,500
Well, today it is.

452
00:31:45,601 --> 00:31:49,100
<i>Alright, guys. We need to get
close enough to clamp on to it.</i>

453
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:53,700
<i>Get enough of us drilled in, we can
fly it like a ship... a really slow ship.</i>

454
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:58,300
<i>It's probably gonna be a real pain
in the ass to steer, but a ship nonetheless.</i>

455
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:14,100
<i>OK, let's take this big gal for a stroll.</i>

456
00:32:14,101 --> 00:32:17,000
<i>Flights Three and Four,
begin your burn. Full thrust.</i>

457
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:34,600
<i>Son of a bitch! We might be able to pull this off
after all! Flights One and Two, begin your burn.</i>

458
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:35,900
It's working?

459
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:38,600
- It's slow going, but, uh, yes,
they're bringing it towards the planet.

460
00:32:38,601 --> 00:32:42,100
They should be able to get
here before our cut-off time.

461
00:32:42,101 --> 00:32:46,100
- So we can actually do this?
- I think so, yes.

462
00:32:47,401 --> 00:32:51,600
OK, time to tell people.
Patch me into the PA, please.

463
00:32:53,901 --> 00:33:00,300
May I have your attention? As you all know,
we have found ourselves in a spot of trouble.

464
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:04,200
The reality is that no matter where
we try to hide on this planet,

465
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:07,800
the Replicator satellite
will be able to track us.

466
00:33:07,801 --> 00:33:13,200
Therefore, Doctor McKay and Colonel Sheppard
have come up with a rather ingenious way for us

467
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:17,200
to escape the satellite's range altogether.

468
00:33:17,201 --> 00:33:23,300
In the next few hours, we will fire
the city's stardrive and head into space.

469
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:28,000
Atlantis is leaving this planet.

470
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:39,000
- May I come in?
- Of course.

471
00:33:39,501 --> 00:33:44,150
- All non-essential personnel have
been beamed to the Apollo.   - Good. Good.

472
00:33:44,151 --> 00:33:46,400
Has Doctor McKay located
your new home yet?

473
00:33:46,601 --> 00:33:48,600
Yes. M12-578.

474
00:33:48,601 --> 00:33:51,000
It's the closest
non-populated habitable planet

475
00:33:51,001 --> 00:33:54,900
with a large ocean. He's a bit nervous
about trying to land on solid ground.

476
00:33:54,901 --> 00:33:57,400
I can understand that.

477
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:04,100
- Listen, I know you don't like me very much...
- Colonel, that's nei...   - That's OK.

478
00:34:04,101 --> 00:34:08,200
To be honest, I'm not that
crazy about you either.

479
00:34:09,151 --> 00:34:10,800
OK!

480
00:34:10,801 --> 00:34:15,200
But if I've crossed the line here
or there in regards to your command,

481
00:34:15,201 --> 00:34:19,000
I apologise. I'm used to making the calls.

482
00:34:19,001 --> 00:34:22,400
But I don't want you to think
I don't respect you. I do, Doctor.

483
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:29,500
Thank you. I appreciate that. I wish
the rest of the military felt the same way.

484
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:36,000
Well, I can't speak to that. I do know
General O'Neill is awfully fond of you.

485
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,000
I'd better be heading out.

486
00:34:41,201 --> 00:34:46,800
- Good luck.
- Thanks. We're gonna need it.

487
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,700
Alright. Zelenka is doing a final
pass over all the coding we've done,

488
00:34:56,701 --> 00:34:59,000
but so far it's looking good.

489
00:34:59,001 --> 00:35:03,100
The underwater drilling platform's power output
has been dialled up as high as it'll go,

490
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,900
and the crew down there have
been beamed up to the Apollo.

491
00:35:05,901 --> 00:35:07,400
We're gonna wreck
that thing, aren't we?

492
00:35:07,401 --> 00:35:10,900
What, the drilling platform?
Oh, hell, yes! But

493
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:16,000
thirty percent of our total power requirements are
gonna be consumed in the first ten seconds of flight.

494
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:19,700
The station will provide us with that
power right up until we snap the umbilical,

495
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,700
at which point we switch
over to the ZPM. Now,

496
00:35:22,701 --> 00:35:28,300
if we can interrupt the satellite's beam,
which is greatly taxing our power levels

497
00:35:28,301 --> 00:35:32,900
we should be able to squeeze out just
enough power to actually do this thing.

498
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:37,400
- How's Lorne doin'?   - He's making good time.
He should be here in the next twenty minutes.

499
00:35:39,201 --> 00:35:41,800
Well, I guess it's showtime.

500
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:45,500
- You sure you can do this?
- Fly the city?

501
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,800
What else could I possibly
be talking about?

502
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:50,800
I flew a V22 Osprey once.

503
00:35:50,801 --> 00:35:52,400
Was it as big as a city?

504
00:35:52,401 --> 00:35:57,800
Well, you had to use your hands and feet with that one.
This one, you just have to sit down and think... "Fly."

505
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:02,200
OK, why don't you just get in
the Chair and start your pre-flight?

506
00:36:06,001 --> 00:36:08,400
Oh, I'm gonna head up
to the Control Room,

507
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:11,600
and Zelenka will monitor
output from the ZPM Room.

508
00:36:11,601 --> 00:36:15,600
And, uh, good luck.

509
00:36:15,601 --> 00:36:17,500
You too.

510
00:36:24,801 --> 00:36:26,700
<i>Doctor McKay,
can you read me?</i>

511
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,300
Five by five.
Lorne, you in position?

512
00:36:29,301 --> 00:36:31,700
<i>We're getting close.
You about ready?</i>

513
00:36:31,701 --> 00:36:33,600
Zelenka, I need a Go or No Go.

514
00:36:33,601 --> 00:36:36,500
<i>We're Go. All non-essential systems
have been shut down. We're in the green.</i>

515
00:36:36,501 --> 00:36:39,600
- Are you ready, Sheppard?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

516
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:42,500
OK, Major, make sure she's
moving as slow as possible.

517
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:45,000
<i>Are you sure we shouldn't
just lob this thing at the satellite?</i>

518
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,500
No, they'd easily be able to navigate
back into position. This is still our best bet.

519
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:49,700
<i>Copy that.</i>

520
00:36:58,601 --> 00:37:05,500
<i>Package is away and on course.
We're heading back to the Apollo. Good luck.</i>

521
00:37:05,901 --> 00:37:10,300
OK, calculating travel time
based on current speed.

522
00:37:10,301 --> 00:37:13,300
That's it. We're good.

523
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:17,400
Here goes nothing.

524
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:46,300
Asteroid is entering the beam.

525
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:15,000
<i>We're on the surface.
Fire the stardrive.</i>

526
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:33,600
We're not flying high enough.
It's stalling out!

527
00:38:34,601 --> 00:38:36,100
It's not working.

528
00:38:36,301 --> 00:38:37,600
What are you doing wrong?

529
00:38:37,601 --> 00:38:38,450
<i>Sure, blame me.
We don't have enough power.</i>

530
00:38:38,451 --> 00:38:40,400
Sure, blame me.
We don't have enough power.

531
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:45,400
- Oh, sure, blame me!   - It's not working.
What other reasons could there be?

532
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,400
I have no more power to give you!

533
00:38:47,401 --> 00:38:49,300
- Shut it off.
- What?

534
00:38:49,301 --> 00:38:54,200
- Lower the shield.   - We're about to go into space!
If you plan on breathing, we're gonna need the shield.

535
00:38:54,601 --> 00:38:56,400
Turn it back on at eighteen thousand feet.
We just need the boost to get started, no?

536
00:38:56,201 --> 00:38:59,200
<i>Turn it back on at eighteen thousand feet.
We just need the boost to get started, no?</i>

537
00:38:59,201 --> 00:39:00,401
That might work.

538
00:39:10,301 --> 00:39:13,000
<i>OK, I did it.
Give it all you've got.</i>

539
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,500
That's it!

540
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,500
We're flying!

541
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:57,700
That's it. Time's up.
Raising the shield.

542
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:24,000
Taking us into hyperspace.

543
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:36,800
We did it!

544
00:40:39,701 --> 00:40:41,500
McKay! Elizabeth!

545
00:40:41,501 --> 00:40:46,700
<i>I need a medical team to the
Control Room, stat! Multiple injuries!</i>

546
00:41:02,601 --> 00:41:06,400
- Keller, what happened?   - Apparently the beam
grazed the tower and blew out the...

547
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:09,700
Adams, that guy just has a cut. Tell him
to put pressure on it and move on.

548
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,400
There's a lot of people
worse off upstairs.

549
00:41:11,401 --> 00:41:13,900
Elizabeth? Is she gonna be OK?

550
00:41:13,901 --> 00:41:16,300
I don't know yet. She took quite a fall
and her pupils are sluggish.

551
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:20,700
I'm gonna have to get her
under a scanner. I'll know more in a bit.

552
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:29,500
Oh, God. Are you alright?

553
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,300
- Yeah, I've had worse.
- How come no-one's helping you?

554
00:41:32,301 --> 00:41:34,600
I told them I didn't need any help.
Other people need more.

555
00:41:34,601 --> 00:41:38,700
- I doubt that. Get this man to the Infirmary.
- Yes, sir.

556
00:41:38,701 --> 00:41:42,300
- You guys alright?
- All things considered.

557
00:41:42,301 --> 00:41:46,500
- What happened?   - The beam grazed the side
of the tower before the shield was completely closed.

558
00:41:46,501 --> 00:41:49,200
- Damage?
- Minimal, I think.

559
00:41:49,201 --> 00:41:53,100
Look, I was able to get the shield up
fairly quickly. It took the brunt of the blow.

560
00:41:53,101 --> 00:41:55,700
Oh, what now?

561
00:41:56,101 --> 00:41:57,900
What is happening?

562
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:04,300
- We just dropped out of hyperspace.
- Have we already reached M12-578?

563
00:42:04,301 --> 00:42:06,900
No. There's no way. It should have taken
at least another few hours.

564
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,900
- The hyperdrive just shut down.
- Why?

565
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,400
- I don't know.
- Get it back up.

566
00:42:10,401 --> 00:42:14,700
I just said I don't know what's wrong. I can't get
it back up if I don't know what happened.

567
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,800
- Where are we?
- In the middle of nowhere.

568
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:19,700
There's no planets,
no moons, no Stargates.

569
00:42:19,701 --> 00:42:22,500
How much power do we have?

570
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:27,400
- This can't be right.
- How much?

571
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:30,700
At current consumption, we've got
twenty-four hours of power left.

572
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:31,700
After that, there's no shield.

573
00:42:31,701 --> 00:42:35,300
- No shield, no atmosphere. No atmosphere,
we're...   - Can we use the Stargate?
