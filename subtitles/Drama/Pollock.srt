1
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,523
Who's the greatest drummer
in the world?

2
00:02:41,529 --> 00:02:42,882
Krupa.

3
00:02:43,929 --> 00:02:45,681
- You got it.
- That guy cooks.

4
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:48,807
You're damn right, I got it.

5
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:52,641
Fuck Picasso.

6
00:02:52,809 --> 00:02:54,720
That fucking guy.

7
00:02:55,289 --> 00:03:00,488
Fuck Picasso! Fuck Picasso--

8
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:07,560
Fucking guy...
Fucking guy's done it all.

9
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:15,122
- You're doing good work.
- No, I'm not. I'm not worth shit.

10
00:03:17,009 --> 00:03:21,525
- It's not worth shit, Sande.
- Get on your feet.

11
00:03:34,009 --> 00:03:36,728
We're having a child, Sande.

12
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:39,643
He's my brother.

13
00:03:39,809 --> 00:03:42,960
I'm not going to put up
with it anymore.

14
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:50,603
The government stated yesterday that
its patience with Japan was exhausted.

15
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:55,399
After two weeks of negotiations between
Japanese and American officials...

16
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,766
...Secretary of State Hull declared
that another Japanese move...

17
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:01,489
... into Thailand
would not be tolerated.

18
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,765
The effect of the statement
seemed to be...

19
00:04:03,929 --> 00:04:06,079
It's hot.

20
00:04:07,089 --> 00:04:10,365
In other news,
the first complete--

21
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:43,402
Jackson Pollock?

22
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:46,525
I'm Lee Krasner.

23
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:49,362
We're in John Graham's show together.

24
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,043
You're working?

25
00:05:53,969 --> 00:05:59,441
It's pretty big-time stuff to be hanging
with Picasso and Braque and that kind.

26
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:07,845
I thought I knew all the abstract artists
in New York, and I don't know Pollock.

27
00:06:08,009 --> 00:06:11,206
Here's a name I've never heard of.

28
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:13,929
So, being cheeky,
I just hoofed it over here.

29
00:06:14,089 --> 00:06:17,320
I could come back
another time.

30
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:22,045
- No, it's--
- Could I see your work?

31
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:41,766
I don't know what I expected,
but my God...

32
00:06:41,929 --> 00:06:44,238
- Who do you study with?
- Nobody.

33
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,888
Did you ever?

34
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,206
- Thom Benton.
- Benton?

35
00:06:49,369 --> 00:06:51,360
You don't paint like Benton.

36
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:55,721
Carl Jung and John Graham
helped me get over Benton.

37
00:06:56,769 --> 00:06:59,442
Which one are you showing?

38
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,688
That one.

39
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,285
- I'm not sure I'm finished with it.
- I don't think you should touch it.

40
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,318
I'd like it if you would come
to my studio. Would you?

41
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,288
Yeah. Sure.

42
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:27,926
- I'm just around the corner. Would you?
- Yeah. Thanks.

43
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:31,482
It's 23.

44
00:07:35,009 --> 00:07:40,288
Twenty-three East Ninth.

45
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:46,081
Really, yes. You don't have to
give me a "when." Just pop on over.

46
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:34,078
I didn't think it would take you
three weeks to come by.

47
00:08:34,249 --> 00:08:38,925
- It hasn't been three weeks.
- To the day.

48
00:08:47,009 --> 00:08:51,525
It's not mine.
I didn't do it. Ex- lover.

49
00:08:53,369 --> 00:08:55,758
That one I did 10 years ago.

50
00:09:11,849 --> 00:09:13,885
Interesting.

51
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:25,287
To whom shall I hire myself out?
What beast must I adore?

52
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:29,442
What holy image is attack ed?
What hearts must I break?

53
00:09:29,609 --> 00:09:32,646
What lie must I maintain?
In what blood tread?

54
00:09:32,809 --> 00:09:36,006
Part of Rimbaud's Season in Hell.

55
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:41,086
That's the one I'm putting
in the Graham show.

56
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:43,809
That's a damn good picture.

57
00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,402
That works. You're a damn good
woman painter.

58
00:09:51,929 --> 00:09:54,363
- You want coffee?
- Yeah, sure. Thanks.

59
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:57,282
- Well, let's go.
- What?

60
00:09:57,449 --> 00:10:00,486
You don't think I make it here?

61
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,561
I met you before, you know.

62
00:10:06,649 --> 00:10:12,007
It was maybe five years ago.
A loft dance.

63
00:10:12,169 --> 00:10:14,637
You were six sheets to the wind.

64
00:10:14,809 --> 00:10:17,243
You cut in and stepped
all over my feet.

65
00:10:17,409 --> 00:10:20,128
Yeah. Got it. Right.

66
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:25,317
- You were falling all over me.
- I'm sorry.

67
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,081
You were overseas, you know.
It's kind of vivid in my memory.

68
00:10:34,049 --> 00:10:38,964
I thought, if you remembered,
to let you know it was okay.

69
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:41,006
Thanks.

70
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:46,766
Really.

71
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:00,920
When did you study with Benton?

72
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,566
'31.

73
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:10,164
The Art Students League?

74
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:15,084
My brother Charles
was studying with Benton...

75
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:18,161
...and so I came out...

76
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:22,048
...and joined him.

77
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:28,565
Where are you from?

78
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:32,642
Arizona. Actually, California.

79
00:11:37,809 --> 00:11:38,958
I'm from Brooklyn.

80
00:11:39,129 --> 00:11:41,768
I was just gonna ask you
where you were from.

81
00:11:41,929 --> 00:11:46,366
My parents came over from Russia.
I'm from right here.

82
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:48,478
Russia.

83
00:14:28,609 --> 00:14:30,645
Potatoes.

84
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:33,684
Thanks.

85
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:54,278
Did you people eat
like this all the time?

86
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:07,044
How long will you be
in the city, Mrs. Pollock?

87
00:15:07,289 --> 00:15:09,564
For a spell.

88
00:15:09,729 --> 00:15:13,563
We've asked Mother to come
live with us in Connecticut.

89
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:18,118
Sande found out they're thinking of
drafting married men with children...

90
00:15:18,289 --> 00:15:21,759
...who aren't involved
in war production.

91
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,921
I took a job in Connecticut.
Deep River.

92
00:15:27,889 --> 00:15:31,120
Making gliders for the Army.

93
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:34,641
Gee, that's great, Sande.

94
00:15:37,249 --> 00:15:39,319
That's swell. Congratulations.

95
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:42,885
Not everyone can arrange
to be 4-F, Jack.

96
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,202
Benny Goodman, Gene Krupa...
No one greater.

97
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:51,321
- Harry James on trumpet.
- The apartment will be all yours.

98
00:15:51,489 --> 00:15:54,049
You'll have lots of space.

99
00:16:32,289 --> 00:16:34,245
Is this the best hotel
you could find?

100
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,048
- What's she doing here?
- Lee's gonna take you home.

101
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,078
- What's she doing here?
- You need to get cleaned up.

102
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:03,718
Feed him some milk
and some eggs.

103
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:16,287
- Okay.
- Come on.

104
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:19,449
It's okay. It's okay.

105
00:18:04,449 --> 00:18:07,009
Thank you.

106
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:24,561
You've gotta see his work.
No one is doing what Pollock is doing.

107
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:29,681
Yes, of course. It would be just great
if you could stop by.

108
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:33,808
Wonderful.
We'll look forward to it. Bye.

109
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:54,403
Jackson, breakfast is on the table.

110
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:01,801
Lee.

111
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:05,245
Reuben.

112
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:06,684
Hello.

113
00:19:06,889 --> 00:19:10,723
- Lee Krasner, Howard Putzel.
- How nice to meet you.

114
00:19:10,889 --> 00:19:14,768
Howard's been working
with Peggy Guggenheim.

115
00:19:15,009 --> 00:19:17,762
Howard, of course.

116
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:22,997
Reuben's here with Howard Putzel.
He works with Peggy Guggenheim.

117
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:30,282
When did you get back?

118
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:32,925
I thought you were in Los Angeles.

119
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,886
- They stationed me in Brooklyn.
- Look at you!

120
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:38,519
- This is Howard Putzel.
- I am so pleased to meet you.

121
00:19:38,689 --> 00:19:41,362
- I've known this guy since high school.
- I met Howard in L.A...

122
00:19:41,529 --> 00:19:44,885
...before he hooked up with Peggy.
We ran into each other yesterday.

123
00:19:45,049 --> 00:19:49,486
- How are Barbara and the kids?
- They're coming out in a couple weeks.

124
00:19:49,649 --> 00:19:52,561
- How long you here for?
- They're gonna ship me to India.

125
00:19:52,729 --> 00:19:55,482
- What about you?
- 4-F.

126
00:19:55,689 --> 00:19:59,841
- Too neurotic.
- You dog.

127
00:20:20,729 --> 00:20:22,799
Genius.

128
00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:26,079
Peggy must see this.

129
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:39,838
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi, Lee.

130
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:42,477
Come on, Jackson.

131
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:50,604
Come here, Jackson.
Peggy Guggenheim.

132
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:52,680
I'm so glad you made it.

133
00:20:52,849 --> 00:20:56,603
Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock,
James Sweeney from the Modern.

134
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,964
- Nice to meet you.
- Miss Peggy Guggenheim.

135
00:20:59,129 --> 00:21:00,608
Hello.

136
00:21:00,769 --> 00:21:03,806
Mr. Pollock, Howard
has been talking about you.

137
00:21:03,969 --> 00:21:06,483
Thank you, Howard.
You must see Jackson's work.

138
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,799
Yes. Well, enjoy yourself.

139
00:21:09,289 --> 00:21:12,122
- I like those earrings.
- Thank you.

140
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:16,688
It's great, Howard.

141
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,922
But there's not one American painter
in the whole goddamn show.

142
00:22:30,689 --> 00:22:33,203
What's this?

143
00:22:35,049 --> 00:22:39,759
I see the head, the body...

144
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:46,043
This isn't cubism. You're not breaking
down the figure into multiple views.

145
00:22:46,209 --> 00:22:49,599
You're just showing us one side.

146
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:54,524
Well, what is this?
Free association? Automatism?

147
00:22:54,689 --> 00:22:58,523
- I'm just painting, Lee.
- But what are you doing, Jackson?

148
00:22:58,689 --> 00:23:02,125
Don't tell me you don't know
what you're doing.

149
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:07,677
Are you experimenting
with surrealism?

150
00:23:08,449 --> 00:23:11,407
Is this a dream?

151
00:23:12,329 --> 00:23:16,402
Even if it's a dream, it's still
what you see. It's life.

152
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:19,242
You're not just randomly
putting paint on the canvas.

153
00:23:19,409 --> 00:23:21,206
You're painting something.

154
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:25,601
You can't abstract from nothing.
You can only abstract from life.

155
00:23:25,769 --> 00:23:28,567
- From nature.
- I am nature.

156
00:23:28,729 --> 00:23:32,358
If you only work from inside yourself,
you'll repeat yourself.

157
00:23:32,529 --> 00:23:35,362
Why don't you paint
the fucking thing.

158
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:43,126
O the moon shone bright on Mrs. Porter
And on her daughter

159
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:47,043
- They wash their feet in soda water
- What the hell's that?

160
00:23:47,209 --> 00:23:49,848
Eliot. T.S. Eliot.

161
00:23:50,009 --> 00:23:52,079
Gentlemen, T.S. Eliot.

162
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,086
T.S. Eliot.

163
00:23:57,009 --> 00:23:59,477
Did you hear Gorky
sold to the Modern?

164
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:02,038
Gorky's a cow.

165
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:06,037
They forage and eat, and they come back
to the stable and they're still chewing.

166
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:09,963
He'll look at a Picasso for hours,
go to his studio and spit it out.

167
00:24:10,129 --> 00:24:12,723
- Fuck him.
- But he's so good at it.

168
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,568
But we gotta break through this shit.

169
00:24:15,769 --> 00:24:19,398
- What do you think of Kline?
- Kline's a whore.

170
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,401
- Picasso?
- A has-been.

171
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,719
De Kooning?

172
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:30,002
He's all right. He's learning.

173
00:24:32,089 --> 00:24:35,286
What do you think
of Jackson Pollock?

174
00:24:38,329 --> 00:24:41,207
That's what we think.

175
00:24:47,129 --> 00:24:50,758
- Watch it.
- Jackson!

176
00:24:52,969 --> 00:24:54,960
Come on.

177
00:24:58,889 --> 00:25:00,481
Honey...

178
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:07,443
I've just climbed up and down five
flights of stairs. I'm Peggy Guggenheim.

179
00:25:07,649 --> 00:25:12,359
I do not climb up five flights
of stairs to nobody home. Not I.

180
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:16,442
- I do not climb five flights of stairs.
- We're sorry.

181
00:25:16,609 --> 00:25:19,806
"Sorry" is not the word for it.
I have weak ankles.

182
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:24,685
- My fault.
- My God, and you're drunk.

183
00:25:25,009 --> 00:25:26,488
You're drunk. Are you drunk?

184
00:25:26,689 --> 00:25:28,725
- No.
- No.

185
00:25:50,289 --> 00:25:54,567
" L.K."? Who the hell is L.K.?
I didn't come here to look at L.K.

186
00:25:54,729 --> 00:25:57,926
Peggy, this way.

187
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:16,800
Now, these show something.
This is better.

188
00:26:16,969 --> 00:26:19,278
The most powerful work
to come around the pike.

189
00:26:19,449 --> 00:26:22,009
There's no three ways about it.

190
00:26:22,169 --> 00:26:27,482
You're not really a surrealist
and, well, my few Americans are.

191
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:30,721
What's most impressed Jackson
about the European moderns...

192
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:36,282
...is their concept that the source
of art comes from the unconscious.

193
00:26:36,449 --> 00:26:37,768
Yes, yes. I'm sure.

194
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:51,527
Howard. Jackson, Howard's here.

195
00:26:51,689 --> 00:26:54,283
Do you want coffee?

196
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,002
- Jackson?
- Yeah.

197
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:00,364
Howard's here.

198
00:27:00,729 --> 00:27:02,162
Hi, Howard.

199
00:27:02,369 --> 00:27:06,078
You've got your first one-man show.
Art of This Century, November 7th.

200
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:09,127
- Bravo, Jackson.
- Congratulations.

201
00:27:09,329 --> 00:27:11,047
Here, have a seat.

202
00:27:12,849 --> 00:27:17,559
Peggy will give you a stipend
of $150 a month.

203
00:27:17,729 --> 00:27:21,039
" If at year's end the artist does not
sell equivalent to the advance...

204
00:27:21,209 --> 00:27:25,487
...plus one-third commission, he will
make up the difference in paintings."

205
00:27:25,649 --> 00:27:30,040
If you don't sell $2400 worth,
Peggy owns all the work. So sell.

206
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:33,685
In addition, Peggy has
commissioned you to paint...

207
00:27:33,889 --> 00:27:38,883
...a mural for the entrance hall to her
new townhouse on 61 st and Lexington.

208
00:27:39,049 --> 00:27:42,121
And it's big, Jackson.
Eight feet by 20 feet.

209
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,998
You have total artistic license.
Paint anything you like.

210
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:49,281
You will be the sensation
of the season.

211
00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:01,757
This is my new painter,
Jackson Pollock.

212
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:06,798
You know James Johnson.

213
00:28:07,129 --> 00:28:09,768
Tony, you know
Peggy Guggenheim, don't you?

214
00:28:09,929 --> 00:28:14,081
Tony Smith.
He's a wonderful architect.

215
00:28:15,809 --> 00:28:17,606
- Will.
- Hi.

216
00:28:17,769 --> 00:28:18,758
Mr. de Kooning.

217
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:20,448
- Jackson.
- Mom.

218
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:25,888
My, my, my. God is good.

219
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,762
- How are you, Mom?
- I'm fine.

220
00:28:29,929 --> 00:28:33,001
- Who is this?
- Peggy Guggenheim. This is my mother.

221
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,966
- How do you do?
- Lovely to meet you.

222
00:28:35,129 --> 00:28:38,246
- This is James Johnson Sweeney.
- You must be proud.

223
00:28:38,409 --> 00:28:39,762
Of all my boys.

224
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:42,727
Jack, it looks great.

225
00:28:42,889 --> 00:28:47,917
- Well, enjoy.
- Yes, I will. Thank you all.

226
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,248
I don't know what
he's trying to achieve.

227
00:29:01,569 --> 00:29:04,641
This isn't painting.

228
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:09,807
- Are you leaving?
- I don't think it's so hot.

229
00:29:09,969 --> 00:29:11,925
Well, go back and look again.

230
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:17,243
Lee, he's original. He's ambitious.
But there's a lot of mud...

231
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:23,723
...and the titles are pretentious.
Muddiness... Mud abounds.

232
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:26,562
Go back, Clem, and look again.

233
00:29:32,929 --> 00:29:35,397
- Read it. Read it.
- Wait a minute. Okay.

234
00:29:35,569 --> 00:29:40,404
"Jackson Pollock is participating
in his first one-man show.

235
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:45,199
Being young and full of energy,
he takes orders he can't fill."

236
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,007
- Thanks a lot, Clem.
- Listen.

237
00:29:47,169 --> 00:29:50,718
" Pollock has gone through
the influences of Miró, Picasso...

238
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:54,768
...Mexican painting and whatnot,
and has come out on the other side...

239
00:29:54,929 --> 00:29:57,397
...painting mostly
with his own brush."

240
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:00,083
- Not bad.
- " Mostly with his own brush"?

241
00:30:00,249 --> 00:30:02,717
- He's saying you're an original.
- Not one sale.

242
00:30:02,889 --> 00:30:04,641
Rome wasn't built in one day.

243
00:30:54,929 --> 00:30:58,239
What do you see there, Pollock?

244
00:30:59,529 --> 00:31:02,521
You've been looking at it for weeks.

245
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,807
Peggy's threatening to reconsider.

246
00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:26,918
Oh, my God.

247
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:13,638
Is he doing what I think he's doing?

248
00:35:20,169 --> 00:35:21,841
Sorry.

249
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:26,366
Happy New Year, everyone.

250
00:36:08,409 --> 00:36:13,927
That the mural goes on and on,
Clem says, is what makes it so good.

251
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,364
He thinks it's a great painting.

252
00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:20,084
I think you've found
yourself a champion.

253
00:36:20,249 --> 00:36:23,321
It's all bullshit anyway.

254
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:26,640
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

255
00:36:28,929 --> 00:36:32,126
You've had a lot of lovers.

256
00:36:32,409 --> 00:36:36,288
- My share. You want to talk about that?
- You want to go to bed.

257
00:36:36,449 --> 00:36:39,247
- I had something like that in mind.
- I'll take you up on it.

258
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:44,085
I don't think you realize how hard
I work to get people interested in you...

259
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:48,083
...to get you into the right hands,
and then you act so badly.

260
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:54,597
You remind me of a trapped animal.
Promise me, do not rip up my bedroom.

261
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,287
All right, wait a minute.

262
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:02,919
Wait. No, wait!

263
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:05,080
Shit.

264
00:37:07,129 --> 00:37:10,724
Shit. Shit.

265
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:45,480
I went out looking for you.

266
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:50,440
- What are you doing to yourself?
- Nothing.

267
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:53,328
You're doing more than that.

268
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:59,200
It's like a storm. It'll pass.

269
00:38:07,449 --> 00:38:09,724
- You hear about Howard?
- Putzel?

270
00:38:09,889 --> 00:38:12,528
Yeah, he's dead.

271
00:38:13,849 --> 00:38:16,443
Heart attack.

272
00:38:16,969 --> 00:38:19,688
I liked Howard.

273
00:38:23,729 --> 00:38:27,119
- To Howard.
- Yeah.

274
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:30,167
Here's to you, Howard.

275
00:38:38,409 --> 00:38:40,923
Barb and I and the kids...

276
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:45,207
...we're gonna rent a house
on Long lsland this summer.

277
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:49,883
We want you and Lee
to come out there with us.

278
00:38:50,609 --> 00:38:53,681
You gotta get out
of the city for a while.

279
00:38:53,849 --> 00:38:57,125
I ain't doing no harm here.

280
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:03,006
Come on, Jack,
let me take you home.

281
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:10,678
- Lee's gonna be worried sick.
- I'm doing no harm.

282
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,242
Take it easy.

283
00:40:26,569 --> 00:40:29,037
I've had enough.

284
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,919
Take me in.

285
00:40:58,009 --> 00:41:00,159
Deck of cards.

286
00:41:04,609 --> 00:41:06,122
Binoculars.

287
00:41:08,409 --> 00:41:10,479
I got it.

288
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:14,326
I want to get married, Pollock.

289
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:17,199
I suddenly want to.

290
00:41:17,369 --> 00:41:22,397
So either we marry
or we split, I think.

291
00:41:26,329 --> 00:41:29,480
I love you.
I think you're a great artist.

292
00:41:29,649 --> 00:41:32,482
I want you to paint.

293
00:41:33,489 --> 00:41:39,280
I want very much
to keep living with you...

294
00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:43,237
...but I want that commitment
from you too.

295
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:54,680
You'll have to make the decision.

296
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:03,840
Who's that girl you were so gaga over?
The one that played the banjo?

297
00:42:04,009 --> 00:42:05,078
Becky.

298
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:07,046
Becky Tarwater.

299
00:42:07,209 --> 00:42:12,567
- God, you were so crazy for her.
- I asked her to marry me.

300
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:16,517
- What did she say?
- No.

301
00:42:19,249 --> 00:42:23,686
You know that part of our lives
that's supposed to be so special...

302
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:28,445
...that growing up part?
It was damn hell for me.

303
00:42:28,609 --> 00:42:31,726
It's supposed to be lousy
so the rest is gonna seem easier.

304
00:42:31,889 --> 00:42:34,528
Yeah, only it isn't.

305
00:42:37,529 --> 00:42:39,167
Daddy, Uncle Jackson, come play.

306
00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:42,958
- What are you doing?
- Where are you going?

307
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:50,318
Oh, my God.

308
00:43:03,009 --> 00:43:06,319
Jackson, you want a sandwich?

309
00:43:09,849 --> 00:43:11,567
We could move out here.

310
00:43:12,449 --> 00:43:14,599
Leave New York?

311
00:43:14,769 --> 00:43:18,000
It would be good for us.

312
00:43:24,009 --> 00:43:26,842
Church wedding.

313
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:37,159
- Jackson, there's no need--
- Church wedding or nothing.

314
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:42,360
- No family, please.
- No family.

315
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:48,519
We'll need a witness.

316
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:50,247
May Rosenberg.

317
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:54,243
- And Harold.
- No Harold.

318
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:01,604
What church?

319
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:04,886
That's a good question.

320
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:45,406
- Come here.
- I'm coming.

321
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,722
You're gonna break your back, Jackson.

322
00:44:52,209 --> 00:44:55,201
Here, hold this for me.

323
00:45:02,649 --> 00:45:05,322
You can't find the keys?

324
00:45:05,489 --> 00:45:06,968
Come on.

325
00:45:09,329 --> 00:45:12,241
Be careful.

326
00:45:58,369 --> 00:46:00,439
Look at that.

327
00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:08,083
This is good.

328
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:10,519
Come on.

329
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:20,037
I don't think I've ever seen
a fox before.

330
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:24,168
- He was beautiful, wasn't he?
- His coat was gorgeous.

331
00:46:24,329 --> 00:46:27,685
I bet there's deer around here too.

332
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:22,167
I guess I'll paint in the house.

333
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:46,201
- You're all set. See you next time.
- Thank you.

334
00:47:52,449 --> 00:47:54,167
Howdy.

335
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:09,167
You're the fella moved
into the old Quinn place.

336
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:15,601
Morning.

337
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:53,927
You moved out from the city?

338
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:57,843
I don't blame you. In a world
where they can split a tiny atom...

339
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:00,762
...and blow up hundreds
of thousands of people...

340
00:49:00,929 --> 00:49:03,648
...there's no telling
where it's all gonna lead.

341
00:49:03,809 --> 00:49:07,404
Best to find a quiet place...

342
00:49:07,609 --> 00:49:09,679
...do what you have to do.

343
00:49:10,969 --> 00:49:13,324
You don't have to pay me now.
What's your name?

344
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:17,641
- Jackson Pollock.
- Jackson Pollock.

345
00:49:18,649 --> 00:49:20,207
Yeah.

346
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:08,644
We finally made it.
How are you braving the winter?

347
00:50:08,809 --> 00:50:13,246
- No coal, no hot water, no bathroom.
- Jack wants others to share the misery.

348
00:50:13,409 --> 00:50:17,243
- He loves it.
- How's he doing?

349
00:50:18,209 --> 00:50:22,088
It's good for him
to be away from the city.

350
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:25,002
I guess you're here
to get Jackson drunk again.

351
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:26,921
Lee.

352
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:29,127
Well, let me think.

353
00:50:29,329 --> 00:50:31,684
I never actually got Jack drunk.

354
00:50:31,849 --> 00:50:35,000
I mean, he never really
needed any help.

355
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:39,204
- He wrote us to spend the weekend.
- Rube--

356
00:50:39,409 --> 00:50:41,240
I'm sure you understand.

357
00:50:42,649 --> 00:50:44,526
Reuben.

358
00:51:28,649 --> 00:51:30,128
Come on.

359
00:51:37,169 --> 00:51:39,319
Okay.

360
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:46,284
Hey, how you doing, fella?
Are you lost?

361
00:52:53,329 --> 00:52:56,446
I'm gonna have to find
me more space.

362
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:14,207
How did it go in there today?

363
00:53:15,289 --> 00:53:19,487
I thought you might
make a table or something. Look.

364
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:24,600
Get yourself working again.

365
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,968
Hello, bub.

366
00:54:58,129 --> 00:55:02,088
- Let's make a baby.
- No.

367
00:55:03,169 --> 00:55:05,364
No?

368
00:55:08,209 --> 00:55:11,121
Am I missing something here?

369
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:13,564
Are you missing something?

370
00:55:13,729 --> 00:55:16,766
- We can't.
- We can't?

371
00:55:16,929 --> 00:55:20,046
My life is full enough
with you, Jackson.

372
00:55:20,209 --> 00:55:23,519
Where are you going?
We're husband and wife.

373
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:28,638
I want to have a baby, our baby.
That's what the progression is about.

374
00:55:28,809 --> 00:55:32,438
- That's what the union is about.
- That's not what the union is about.

375
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:35,328
- What else is there?
- That's not what it's about.

376
00:55:35,529 --> 00:55:38,168
- For me!
- The vows don't stipulate " baby."

377
00:55:40,769 --> 00:55:45,047
I am not going to bring
another life into that.

378
00:55:51,249 --> 00:55:53,524
We are painters, Jackson.

379
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:58,728
We don't have any money.
We don't get by. We struggle.

380
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:02,761
You are a great artist.

381
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:05,841
I believe in Jackson Pollock.

382
00:56:06,009 --> 00:56:11,686
There's you and there's the painting,
and you need! You need! You need!

383
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:21,682
And I don't want to be anywhere else.
I don't want to be with...

384
00:56:21,849 --> 00:56:24,841
...anyone else.

385
00:56:26,609 --> 00:56:29,681
But that's all I can handle.

386
00:56:46,249 --> 00:56:48,558
- This is it?
- Please.

387
00:56:48,729 --> 00:56:51,926
- Let's go inside for lunch.
- It's beautiful here.

388
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:55,604
- I want to see paintings.
- Let's go see the paintings.

389
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:57,168
We just moved to the barn.

390
00:56:58,169 --> 00:57:03,197
- Jackson, they're here. Can we come in?
- Sure.

391
00:57:04,729 --> 00:57:07,038
- Jackson.
- Now be careful.

392
00:57:07,209 --> 00:57:11,282
- Jackson!
- Hi, Peggy.

393
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:15,647
I want you to meet Alfonso Ossorio.
This is Jackson Pollock.

394
00:57:15,809 --> 00:57:19,165
And you know him.
Ted? Come on in.

395
00:57:19,689 --> 00:57:21,964
Ted Dragon,
this is Jackson Pollock.

396
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:26,168
They came up for a preview of the show,
and I expect them to buy something.

397
00:57:26,329 --> 00:57:31,084
- It's beautiful. You must be happy.
- Damn near. The country's wonderful.

398
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:35,003
Really, just enjoy.
Now this one I like very much.

399
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:38,286
This was in my last fall show.

400
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:41,885
You're retreating into
imagery again, Jackson.

401
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:46,964
Paint is paint, surface is surface.
That's all they should be.

402
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,882
Now this is...

403
00:57:54,049 --> 00:57:56,722
This is first-rate.

404
00:57:56,889 --> 00:58:00,677
Why don't you do
eight or 10 of those?

405
00:58:01,009 --> 00:58:05,207
Paint is paint, surface is surface.
That's all they should be.

406
00:58:05,409 --> 00:58:08,401
The surrealists confuse
literature with painting.

407
00:58:08,609 --> 00:58:11,965
I can't stand that.
They will not have their way.

408
00:58:12,169 --> 00:58:14,729
What you're doing out there
is better than anything...

409
00:58:14,889 --> 00:58:17,323
...I've seen from you
in a year or more.

410
00:58:17,489 --> 00:58:19,923
No, I gotta backtrack. Peggy's mural.

411
00:58:20,089 --> 00:58:23,240
That's when I thought,
" Here's a great painter."

412
00:58:23,409 --> 00:58:27,243
And people saying to me,
" It's wallpaper. It repeats itself."

413
00:58:27,449 --> 00:58:31,920
It's my plan to return to Europe. I don't
have the energy since Howard died.

414
00:58:32,089 --> 00:58:36,162
- But Jackson needs a gallery.
- Well...

415
00:58:43,849 --> 00:58:47,603
What was the one that missed?
The one that wasn't so good?

416
00:58:47,769 --> 00:58:51,921
You don't have colour yet. You're better
off when you keep your colour quiet.

417
00:58:52,089 --> 00:58:55,445
- Which one was it? I'll fix it.
- The one with all the blue.

418
00:58:55,609 --> 00:58:58,248
- It's predominantly blue.
- The wrong blue? Too much blue?

419
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,640
All I want art to be is good.
The picture misses.

420
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:05,484
- What do you think, Ted?
- It's interesting. I like blue.

421
00:59:05,649 --> 00:59:08,800
- What do you think, Alfonso?
- It's your painting.

422
00:59:08,969 --> 00:59:12,405
- You think it misses.
- Clem may have a point, and he may not.

423
00:59:12,569 --> 00:59:15,481
You think it misses?
You think it might miss?

424
00:59:15,649 --> 00:59:17,958
- You think it might miss?
- It might.

425
00:59:18,129 --> 00:59:20,962
It might. Well, I'll just
go fix it for you.

426
00:59:21,129 --> 00:59:24,166
- Is he all right, Lee?
- He's fine.

427
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,321
So it's all the blue
that's bothering you?

428
00:59:42,529 --> 00:59:44,565
What else?
You want the colour quiet?

429
00:59:44,729 --> 00:59:49,519
- It could be a little quieter.
- Let's just quiet the colour then.

430
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:12,441
Now this is something.

431
01:00:14,929 --> 01:00:18,046
- No matter how drunk you are--
- I'm not drunk.

432
01:00:18,249 --> 01:00:20,843
One thing's sacred for you.

433
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:24,922
Not anybody's feelings
or anything like that.

434
01:00:25,529 --> 01:00:27,281
It's your art.

435
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:31,485
You're not gonna destroy your art.

436
01:00:33,289 --> 01:00:36,042
This is something.

437
01:00:57,769 --> 01:01:01,284
He's had shows with you, Peggy.
He can't suddenly not have a gallery.

438
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:03,883
You owe him.

439
01:01:04,049 --> 01:01:09,077
Sam won't take him.
What did Betty Parsons say?

440
01:01:10,129 --> 01:01:14,327
Everyone drinks.
He's not the only one.

441
01:01:14,489 --> 01:01:18,721
I know, but he's a great painter.

442
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:22,479
Of course. Of course.
I'll call you back.

443
01:04:25,209 --> 01:04:28,007
I'll have supper ready in a jiffy.

444
01:04:28,169 --> 01:04:30,603
Looks like Betty Parsons
may take you in.

445
01:04:30,769 --> 01:04:33,966
Peggy's willing to continue the
monthly allowance through next year.

446
01:04:34,129 --> 01:04:36,438
She'll still own all
your unsold paintings...

447
01:04:36,609 --> 01:04:40,648
...but Betty will get a commission
on new work that sells.

448
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:17,361
You've done it, Pollock.

449
01:05:17,649 --> 01:05:19,765
You've cracked it wide open.

450
01:06:07,169 --> 01:06:08,841
Pass.

451
01:06:10,769 --> 01:06:12,680
A nickel.

452
01:06:14,489 --> 01:06:16,320
I'll see your nickel...

453
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:21,358
...and I'll raise you a quarter.

454
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:23,966
I don't like the look of that smile.

455
01:06:24,129 --> 01:06:27,963
There is a smile of love and
there is a smile of deceit. I'm out.

456
01:06:28,409 --> 01:06:30,718
I'm out.

457
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:34,245
- Too rich for my blood.
- Two twos.

458
01:06:34,769 --> 01:06:38,364
There is a smile of smiles
in which these two smiles meet.

459
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:40,804
- William Blake.
- Such a bluffer.

460
01:06:41,049 --> 01:06:45,884
Jackson, did you hear
de Kooning sold to the Modern?

461
01:06:46,969 --> 01:06:48,084
Want me to deal?

462
01:06:48,249 --> 01:06:51,525
"A singular concentration
of passion and technique...

463
01:06:51,729 --> 01:06:53,799
...fierce energy, virtuosity."

464
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:56,807
It doesn't hurt that his wife
is fucking the critic.

465
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:58,402
- Who?
- De Kooning.

466
01:06:58,569 --> 01:07:02,926
I don't know if I'd agree with
"virtuosity," but it was a hell of a show.

467
01:07:03,089 --> 01:07:07,207
- Did you see the show?
- We're not in Siberia, Clem.

468
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:09,166
So you're the critic now.

469
01:07:09,329 --> 01:07:11,797
No one knows I exist.
Who the hell's talking about me?

470
01:07:12,009 --> 01:07:15,479
- I write about every show you have.
- You're the only one.

471
01:07:15,649 --> 01:07:19,961
- What good does your praise do me?
- It's new stuff. Give it time.

472
01:07:20,129 --> 01:07:22,120
We're broke!

473
01:07:22,289 --> 01:07:25,565
I'm digging clams out of the bay.
I don't see de Kooning digging.

474
01:07:25,769 --> 01:07:28,567
Everyone is struggling.
It'll break for you soon.

475
01:07:28,729 --> 01:07:29,718
When?

476
01:07:29,929 --> 01:07:33,399
I just took part in a roundtable
on modern art...

477
01:07:33,569 --> 01:07:37,164
...held by LIFE magazine,
for God's sakes.

478
01:07:37,329 --> 01:07:40,321
America has become the centre
of Western civilization.

479
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:44,402
You're doing the most original
and vigorous art in the country.

480
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:49,962
- Other critics will catch on. Keep at it.
- Don't tell me to keep at it.

481
01:07:50,129 --> 01:07:52,085
I'm keeping at it!

482
01:07:52,249 --> 01:07:55,605
- Ante up.
- All right, I'm in.

483
01:07:57,409 --> 01:08:01,197
Did old Clem ruffle your feathers?

484
01:08:01,649 --> 01:08:04,607
- I love all women.
- You get off him!

485
01:08:04,769 --> 01:08:07,567
Get off me!
He can take care of himself!

486
01:08:07,729 --> 01:08:11,244
- This is my house, do you understand?!
- Crazy bitch.

487
01:08:11,409 --> 01:08:13,718
This is my house.

488
01:08:18,889 --> 01:08:20,845
Okay.

489
01:08:22,169 --> 01:08:24,683
Well, it's over. I'm glad that's over.

490
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:29,400
Jackson.

491
01:08:30,849 --> 01:08:32,840
Jackson.

492
01:08:55,049 --> 01:08:57,722
I'll be right there.

493
01:09:01,009 --> 01:09:05,400
- Hey, Jackson.
- We owe you $56?

494
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:09,039
That sounds about right.

495
01:09:42,689 --> 01:09:45,328
Hey there, Jackson.

496
01:10:03,849 --> 01:10:08,877
You ought to mind your own
fucking business, bub.

497
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:14,561
Sande, if I can do it, you can too.

498
01:10:14,729 --> 01:10:18,165
It's been three weeks now.
Not a drop.

499
01:10:18,329 --> 01:10:20,559
Hell, I quit for good.

500
01:10:20,729 --> 01:10:24,085
We're still struggling,
but Alfonso and Ted bought a painting.

501
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:28,242
We won't see any of the money till
I sell a bunch more, but guess what...

502
01:10:28,409 --> 01:10:32,880
Demarest Fund came through.
Fifteen hundred bucks.

503
01:10:33,049 --> 01:10:35,688
I bought a Model A.
Ninety bucks.

504
01:10:35,849 --> 01:10:39,364
No, I'm not kidding.
It's just like we used to have.

505
01:10:40,529 --> 01:10:44,807
Okay, would you put Mom back on?
I'd like to say good night.

506
01:10:45,369 --> 01:10:50,602
Okay, then. Well, tell them
good night from Uncle Jack.

507
01:11:44,209 --> 01:11:48,680
- I think the Macys are going to buy.
- Good.

508
01:11:49,649 --> 01:11:53,927
- Are you here?
- Well, that depends.

509
01:11:59,369 --> 01:12:04,489
I'm sorry, he's painting right now.
This is Lee Krasner, his wife.

510
01:12:06,129 --> 01:12:07,960
Yes.

511
01:12:12,409 --> 01:12:16,960
Of course. I'll let him know.

512
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:19,878
Okay, bye.

513
01:12:22,489 --> 01:12:26,607
LIFE magazine. They want
to do an article on you.

514
01:12:28,369 --> 01:12:30,246
Damn.

515
01:12:32,729 --> 01:12:36,199
I don't let the image
carry the painting.

516
01:12:36,369 --> 01:12:39,600
If it creeps in,
I try to do away with it...

517
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:42,488
...to let the painting come through.

518
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:44,958
Hold it a minute there, please.

519
01:12:45,129 --> 01:12:48,246
Pollock spends hours
contemplating a painting.

520
01:12:48,409 --> 01:12:52,084
It may be days or even months
before he tackles it again.

521
01:12:52,289 --> 01:12:54,007
Who are your favourite artists?

522
01:12:54,209 --> 01:12:58,760
De Kooning, Kandinsky...

523
01:13:01,729 --> 01:13:04,926
El Greco, Goya, Rembrandt.

524
01:13:05,249 --> 01:13:07,524
How do you respond
to your critics?

525
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:09,805
They have said,
"A mop of tangled hair."

526
01:13:09,969 --> 01:13:13,041
"A child's contour map
of the Battle of Gettysburg."

527
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:15,882
" Cathartic disintegration."
What do you say?

528
01:13:16,049 --> 01:13:18,802
- You forgot, " Baked macaroni."
- Well?

529
01:13:18,969 --> 01:13:21,881
Well, if people would just...

530
01:13:22,049 --> 01:13:25,485
...leave most of their stuff at home
and look at the paintings...

531
01:13:25,649 --> 01:13:28,846
...I don't think they'd have
any trouble enjoying them.

532
01:13:29,009 --> 01:13:31,239
It's like looking at flowers.

533
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:35,084
You don't tear your hair out
over what it means.

534
01:13:35,249 --> 01:13:39,208
How do you know when
you're finished with a painting?

535
01:13:39,809 --> 01:13:43,768
How do you know when
you're finished making love?

536
01:13:55,449 --> 01:13:57,758
That's better.

537
01:14:07,769 --> 01:14:10,363
Just be yourself.

538
01:14:30,729 --> 01:14:32,845
Delivery.

539
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:08,237
You saw this
LIFE magazine article?

540
01:15:08,409 --> 01:15:10,368
Well, I have plenty if you want
another one. Enjoy the show.

541
01:15:10,369 --> 01:15:12,328
Well, I have plenty if you want
another one. Enjoy the show.

542
01:15:36,649 --> 01:15:39,322
Take a look around, fellas.

543
01:15:39,489 --> 01:15:42,959
These are the big shots.
Jackson broke the ice.

544
01:15:43,529 --> 01:15:46,282
- Hi, how are you?
- Beautiful.

545
01:15:49,449 --> 01:15:52,043
- Do you know the Petersons?
- No.

546
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:55,087
- This is Betty Parsons.
- Thank you.

547
01:15:58,489 --> 01:16:00,161
Sande.

548
01:16:01,449 --> 01:16:04,202
How do you do, sir? Hi, Mom.

549
01:16:04,369 --> 01:16:07,645
- Thank you. Beautiful work.
- Thanks.

550
01:16:08,249 --> 01:16:11,878
Pollock showed 30 pictures
last fall and sold all but five...

551
01:16:12,049 --> 01:16:14,085
...and his collectors
are nibbling at those.

552
01:16:14,289 --> 01:16:18,441
Mr. Pollock, in your opinion,
what is the meaning of modern art?

553
01:16:23,249 --> 01:16:26,207
Modern art, to me...

554
01:16:26,369 --> 01:16:31,887
...is nothing more than the expression
of the contemporary aims...

555
01:16:32,049 --> 01:16:35,485
...of the age we're living in.

556
01:16:36,529 --> 01:16:40,841
Did the classical artists have
any means of expressing their age?

557
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:44,325
Yes, and they did it very well.

558
01:16:44,489 --> 01:16:50,837
All cultures have had means
and techniques of expressing their...

559
01:16:52,049 --> 01:16:55,041
...immediate aims.

560
01:16:57,089 --> 01:17:01,480
The thing that interests me
is that today...

561
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:07,804
...painters do not have to go to
a subject matter outside of themselves.

562
01:17:08,969 --> 01:17:12,882
They work from a different source.
They work from within.

563
01:17:15,049 --> 01:17:19,998
It seems to me that the modern artist
cannot express this age...

564
01:17:20,169 --> 01:17:24,845
...the airplane,
the atom bomb, the radio...

565
01:17:25,009 --> 01:17:30,686
...in the old forms of the Renaissance
or any other past culture.

566
01:17:30,889 --> 01:17:35,917
How do you get the paint on the canvas?
I understand you don't use brushes.

567
01:17:37,289 --> 01:17:40,406
I paint on the floor.

568
01:17:41,089 --> 01:17:46,117
That's not unusual.
The Orientals did that.

569
01:17:46,809 --> 01:17:50,438
Most of the paint I use is a liquid,
flowing kind of paint.

570
01:17:51,649 --> 01:17:55,881
The brushes I use
are used more as sticks.

571
01:17:56,049 --> 01:18:01,407
The brush doesn't actually touch
the canvas, but just above it.

572
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:09,758
Isn't it more difficult to control?
Isn't there more of a possibility of...

573
01:18:09,969 --> 01:18:13,518
...getting too much paint,
splattering, or any number of things?

574
01:18:15,169 --> 01:18:16,602
No, I don't think so.

575
01:18:19,809 --> 01:18:24,041
With experience,
it seems possible to control...

576
01:18:24,609 --> 01:18:30,047
...the flow of the paint to a great
extent, and I don't use--

577
01:18:31,129 --> 01:18:36,157
I don't use the accident
'cause I deny the accident.

578
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:38,485
Did you see
the Magazine of Art review?

579
01:18:38,649 --> 01:18:42,324
It was a public recant,
a complete switcheroo.

580
01:18:42,489 --> 01:18:46,004
Five years ago, he called
Pollock's work " baked macaroni."

581
01:18:46,169 --> 01:18:49,957
Now he says,
"An impregnable language of image...

582
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:54,327
...beautiful and subtle
patterns of pure form."

583
01:18:55,049 --> 01:18:58,678
Come on. Hold it, Mom.

584
01:19:03,089 --> 01:19:05,159
- You all made it.
- Yeah, we made it.

585
01:19:05,329 --> 01:19:06,808
How was it?

586
01:19:06,969 --> 01:19:08,197
- Hi, Elizabeth.
- Hi.

587
01:19:08,689 --> 01:19:10,441
You must be Jeremy.

588
01:19:10,609 --> 01:19:13,646
Dad drove 100 miles an hour
all the way from L.A.

589
01:19:14,329 --> 01:19:17,321
- How are you?
- How you doing? It's nice to see you.

590
01:19:17,489 --> 01:19:19,684
- Hi, Charles.
- Hi, Jack.

591
01:19:19,849 --> 01:19:22,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

592
01:19:22,569 --> 01:19:26,198
- How are you, Karen?
- Nice to meet you. Yes.

593
01:19:32,009 --> 01:19:32,998
Hi, Mom.

594
01:19:33,169 --> 01:19:36,878
It's so nice to have
all my boys together.

595
01:19:37,049 --> 01:19:39,085
I'm so glad everybody's here.

596
01:19:39,249 --> 01:19:42,127
How you doing?
How was the trip?

597
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:45,725
He's so heavy.
Thank you, here you go.

598
01:19:55,729 --> 01:20:00,849
I miss you, you son of a bitch.
I miss you. It's just not the same.

599
01:20:01,009 --> 01:20:04,046
Nothing was ever the same
to begin with.

600
01:20:04,209 --> 01:20:07,326
- What do you think?
- Shangri-la.

601
01:20:07,489 --> 01:20:11,402
- Everybody okay down there?
- You hit the big time, Jack.

602
01:20:11,569 --> 01:20:14,288
How many did you sell
from that November show?

603
01:20:14,449 --> 01:20:17,725
It was the best show I ever had.
It all goes to the house.

604
01:20:17,889 --> 01:20:21,484
I'm buying the acreage next door,
put up a studio for Lee.

605
01:20:21,649 --> 01:20:23,879
Free up the upstairs bedroom,
give her more space.

606
01:20:24,089 --> 01:20:27,479
He articulated the profundity
of Jackson's art...

607
01:20:27,649 --> 01:20:29,765
...more eloquently than anyone has.

608
01:20:29,929 --> 01:20:32,568
- How are they?
- Mother's reading Peter Pan.

609
01:20:32,729 --> 01:20:35,721
This one is from
the most recent Art News.

610
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:38,687
- Story about a boy who never grew up.
- Another rave.

611
01:20:38,849 --> 01:20:42,285
I can't wait to see what he
says about Jackson's next show.

612
01:20:42,809 --> 01:20:44,800
I'm not sure I always get it, Jack.

613
01:20:44,969 --> 01:20:48,564
I'm the only painter
worth looking at in America.

614
01:20:48,729 --> 01:20:51,801
- I expect that's true.
- This guy wants to make a film on me.

615
01:20:51,969 --> 01:20:55,723
- Why?
- Well, they made one on Calder.

616
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:58,323
I have a show coming up
at the Circle Gallery.

617
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:00,844
I'm exhibiting under the name
Charles Pima.

618
01:21:01,009 --> 01:21:03,807
What the hell you doing that for?
This is priced at 4000.

619
01:21:04,009 --> 01:21:07,365
Buy it for 1500.
It'll be worth 100,000 someday.

620
01:21:10,089 --> 01:21:12,762
- Just any kind for me.
- I'll have a cherry.

621
01:21:12,929 --> 01:21:16,604
Does anybody speak ltalian?
I need somebody who speaks ltalian.

622
01:21:21,089 --> 01:21:23,205
Do you speak ltalian?

623
01:21:24,769 --> 01:21:26,725
Here it is. Arte Moderna.

624
01:21:26,889 --> 01:21:31,838
We figured out that much: " Modern Art."
There's an article about me.

625
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:42,487
Anybody know
what that means?

626
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:45,965
- Does anybody wanna play anagrams?
- I do.

627
01:21:46,129 --> 01:21:51,044
- Here's something about " povro Picasso."
- " Povro Picasso." Did you hear that?

628
01:21:52,489 --> 01:21:56,641
- What do you think that means?
- I think it means " poor Picasso."

629
01:21:56,809 --> 01:22:01,837
" Poor Picasso"? Like, poor Pic--?
Did you guys hear that? Poor Picasso!

630
01:22:02,009 --> 01:22:05,843
Is Picasso more important
than your family?

631
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:22,528
I had this dream.

632
01:22:22,689 --> 01:22:26,125
I'm at the edge of a cliff,
and my brothers are there...

633
01:22:26,289 --> 01:22:29,326
...and they're trying
to push me off the cliff.

634
01:22:29,489 --> 01:22:32,845
Goddamn fucking nightmare.

635
01:22:39,409 --> 01:22:41,125
Okay, we're rolling.
Now come back in.

636
01:22:41,126 --> 01:22:42,841
Okay, we're rolling.
Now come back in.

637
01:22:43,009 --> 01:22:45,364
Don't stop.

638
01:22:45,929 --> 01:22:47,248
That's good.

639
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:52,164
Stop, stop.
Go to the chair, sit down.

640
01:22:52,329 --> 01:22:54,843
Put your shoes on.

641
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:02,600
Your head's too low.
Lift it up.

642
01:23:02,769 --> 01:23:08,560
Don't talk. We see your mouth moving.
You're supposed to be alone. Cut.

643
01:23:09,809 --> 01:23:12,277
We gotta do it again.
You can't talk.

644
01:23:22,489 --> 01:23:26,801
Now sit down.
Don't look at camera.

645
01:23:28,889 --> 01:23:31,926
That's good. Shoes.

646
01:23:34,849 --> 01:23:36,202
Yeah.

647
01:23:39,489 --> 01:23:41,605
That's better.
That looks good.

648
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:49,286
Cut. Cut. You need
to take more time looking.

649
01:23:49,449 --> 01:23:54,921
Like-- I don't know.
Like you're thinking or wondering or...

650
01:24:36,449 --> 01:24:38,167
Cut.

651
01:24:40,489 --> 01:24:42,923
Jackson, cut.

652
01:24:43,729 --> 01:24:45,526
Cut. We ran out of film.

653
01:25:05,329 --> 01:25:08,526
Just tell him you don't wanna do it.

654
01:25:09,129 --> 01:25:11,199
I can't.

655
01:25:11,929 --> 01:25:13,726
Not polite.

656
01:25:13,889 --> 01:25:16,244
It's been a month.

657
01:25:16,609 --> 01:25:19,806
He wants to get it right.

658
01:25:24,009 --> 01:25:26,398
It's not just that, anyway.

659
01:25:31,489 --> 01:25:33,684
I feel like a phoney.

660
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,363
You're a great painter, Pollock.

661
01:25:37,529 --> 01:25:39,884
Just paint.

662
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:14,325
He wants to shoot through glass
so he can see my face.

663
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:17,963
You're the star.

664
01:26:18,569 --> 01:26:22,084
I feel like a clam without a shell.

665
01:26:23,209 --> 01:26:25,165
Fuck him.

666
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:28,961
Fuck him. It's not for you.

667
01:26:31,809 --> 01:26:35,484
I think it's gonna be
your best show ever, Jackson.

668
01:26:35,689 --> 01:26:37,884
Everything works.

669
01:26:38,049 --> 01:26:40,119
The big pictures.

670
01:26:40,289 --> 01:26:42,883
The smaller ones. It's phenomenal.

671
01:26:48,729 --> 01:26:51,960
I don't think it's going
to sell, though.

672
01:27:02,649 --> 01:27:05,800
- Take care of yourself.
- Will do.

673
01:27:41,249 --> 01:27:45,879
I can't believe they're still
out there. He's gotta be frozen.

674
01:27:46,209 --> 01:27:51,078
- Hello.
- Hello. Happy Thanksgiving.

675
01:28:04,169 --> 01:28:07,445
Yeah. The light's gone.

676
01:28:07,609 --> 01:28:10,567
That's it, Jackson.

677
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:15,841
We're done. It's great.
It's marvellous.

678
01:28:21,449 --> 01:28:24,964
- Jackson.
- Jackson, where have you been?

679
01:28:38,209 --> 01:28:41,360
Jackson, please.

680
01:28:55,649 --> 01:28:57,799
Damn it, Hans, we need this.

681
01:28:59,529 --> 01:29:01,838
Come in here.

682
01:29:05,249 --> 01:29:08,002
Here, this one's for you.

683
01:29:08,169 --> 01:29:11,127
First drink I've had in two years.

684
01:29:11,289 --> 01:29:15,407
Don't be a fool, Jackson.

685
01:29:56,769 --> 01:29:59,681
Carve the turkey for me.

686
01:30:04,929 --> 01:30:07,489
- The gravy.
- Anybody wanna eat?

687
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:09,920
The turkey will be served.

688
01:30:10,129 --> 01:30:11,847
I'm not the phoney,
you're the phoney.

689
01:30:12,009 --> 01:30:14,398
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

690
01:30:14,569 --> 01:30:18,198
- I'm not the phoney, you're the phoney.
- Jackson, enough. Okay?

691
01:30:18,369 --> 01:30:21,839
I'm not the phoney, you're the phoney.

692
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:24,284
No, I want you sitting next to me.

693
01:30:24,449 --> 01:30:27,009
Come on, sit next to me.
Here you go.

694
01:30:27,169 --> 01:30:30,639
No, Herbert, I'm sitting
next to my buddy.

695
01:30:35,409 --> 01:30:37,206
I'm not the phoney,
you're the phoney.

696
01:30:37,409 --> 01:30:39,047
How about a toast
to our hostess?

697
01:30:39,249 --> 01:30:41,968
I'm not the phoney,
you're the phoney.

698
01:30:42,769 --> 01:30:45,158
- Should I do it now, Hans?
- Here we go.

699
01:30:45,369 --> 01:30:46,484
- Now?
- Stop it.

700
01:30:46,689 --> 01:30:48,202
Now, Hans?

701
01:30:48,409 --> 01:30:49,637
Now?

702
01:30:49,849 --> 01:30:51,680
Now!

703
01:33:43,289 --> 01:33:47,487
I understand there was a ruckus
over my Partisan Review article.

704
01:33:47,649 --> 01:33:50,083
Go find it, Lee.

705
01:33:50,249 --> 01:33:52,319
- Jackson.
- Jewish cunt.

706
01:33:52,489 --> 01:33:55,003
Lee's the one who wants you here.

707
01:33:55,169 --> 01:33:58,639
I call them the way I see them.
You want it any other way?

708
01:33:58,809 --> 01:34:03,280
You call them the way you see them?
I'm traded in for Clyfford Still.

709
01:34:03,449 --> 01:34:05,326
That's not what Clem's saying.

710
01:34:05,689 --> 01:34:08,487
Clyfford Still is one of the most
original painters around.

711
01:34:08,689 --> 01:34:10,998
- If not the best?
- If not the best.

712
01:34:11,169 --> 01:34:13,399
- Did you read the article?
- I read the whole thing.

713
01:34:13,569 --> 01:34:16,037
- Clem wasn't trading you for Still.
- What was he doing?

714
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:19,884
The article was about the direction
of modern art. It's not just about you.

715
01:34:20,049 --> 01:34:21,801
- I'm not talking to you.
- If you--

716
01:34:21,969 --> 01:34:25,166
I'm not talking to you! Shut up!

717
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:32,168
You didn't review '52, the '54 show
was "forced." Is that right?

718
01:34:32,369 --> 01:34:35,486
- As I saw it, yes.
- Have I lost my stuff, Clem?

719
01:34:35,649 --> 01:34:39,437
Everybody loses their stuff.
You had a good 10-year run.

720
01:34:40,089 --> 01:34:42,967
Everything's gorgeous.

721
01:34:43,169 --> 01:34:46,127
Gorgeous isn't good enough.

722
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:48,245
What do you want from me?

723
01:34:48,689 --> 01:34:51,761
I like Easter and the Totem.

724
01:34:51,929 --> 01:34:55,922
Is it as good as the Peterson
it was next to at the Carnegie exhibit?

725
01:34:56,089 --> 01:34:59,081
The Peterson was better.

726
01:35:00,129 --> 01:35:04,361
Yeah, well, I had something going
in that picture, but it missed.

727
01:35:05,329 --> 01:35:08,002
I had something going
in The Deep too, but it just missed.

728
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:10,683
- The Deep was a kiss-ass to Still.
- No one asked you!

729
01:35:10,849 --> 01:35:13,158
Clyfford Still couldn't
polish Jackson's shoes.

730
01:35:13,329 --> 01:35:15,047
Look what you painted
when you were sober.

731
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:17,484
Now that you're back on booze,
do you paint real pictures?

732
01:35:17,649 --> 01:35:20,004
- Climb off my back, bitch!
- You're a bum!

733
01:35:20,169 --> 01:35:24,401
- Open that mouth again, I'll kill you!
- You are killing me!

734
01:35:24,609 --> 01:35:27,169
Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch! Bitch!

735
01:35:27,329 --> 01:35:31,242
- You wouldn't have a child!
- That would have fixed everything.

736
01:35:31,449 --> 01:35:33,758
I never loved you!
Go fuck yourself!

737
01:35:33,929 --> 01:35:37,888
- I don't even wanna touch you!
- Your sex life is of no concern to me.

738
01:35:38,089 --> 01:35:40,887
Weekly trips to your therapist.
What a joke.

739
01:35:41,089 --> 01:35:44,968
And whatever trash you pick up at
the Cedar afterwards, I could care less!

740
01:35:45,129 --> 01:35:47,279
You don't wanna stay here.

741
01:35:47,449 --> 01:35:50,680
This is morning to night. This happens
over taking out the garbage!

742
01:35:50,849 --> 01:35:54,000
What are you looking for?
What are you pushing me for?

743
01:35:54,209 --> 01:35:55,881
Stop crying about it and paint!

744
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:58,762
You're Jackson Pollock,
and you don't paint!

745
01:35:58,969 --> 01:36:01,278
It's a tragedy, and I can't stand it.

746
01:36:01,489 --> 01:36:02,604
Paint!

747
01:36:28,009 --> 01:36:30,079
- Hi.
- Hi.

748
01:36:43,889 --> 01:36:47,325
- You look great.
- Thanks. I missed you.

749
01:37:06,409 --> 01:37:10,800
- Don't look at me that way.
- I'm not looking at you.

750
01:37:14,569 --> 01:37:19,040
I was thinking we could visit Peggy
in Venice, see the Biennale.

751
01:37:19,409 --> 01:37:23,641
Time to go to Europe is when
you're very young or very old.

752
01:37:23,809 --> 01:37:25,845
But you should go.

753
01:37:26,009 --> 01:37:29,319
Everybody should do
what the hell they wanna do.

754
01:37:39,049 --> 01:37:43,839
She left it in the car.
I'm surprised she hasn't missed it.

755
01:37:44,009 --> 01:37:46,523
You take her
where our friends are.

756
01:37:46,689 --> 01:37:50,318
They have the good grace
not to tell me.

757
01:37:50,489 --> 01:37:53,049
If you don't stop seeing her,
I'm going to leave you.

758
01:37:53,209 --> 01:37:56,645
- I love her.
- You don't.

759
01:38:00,049 --> 01:38:01,562
She's my last chance.

760
01:38:05,649 --> 01:38:09,847
I am not going
to give you a divorce.

761
01:38:30,809 --> 01:38:33,164
If you could be anybody...

762
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:40,567
...who ever lived in the history
of the whole world...

763
01:38:40,729 --> 01:38:43,448
...who would you be?

764
01:38:46,409 --> 01:38:48,206
You.

765
01:39:05,249 --> 01:39:08,207
I'd better get that.

766
01:39:34,689 --> 01:39:36,998
- Hello?
- I'm ridiculous.

767
01:39:37,169 --> 01:39:40,366
I think I left
my passport at the house.

768
01:39:40,529 --> 01:39:45,319
I suppose I'll have to wait
till the next sailing.

769
01:39:46,969 --> 01:39:48,960
Jackson?

770
01:39:51,489 --> 01:39:53,480
Pollock.

771
01:39:55,649 --> 01:40:00,769
Here it is.
I found it buried in my purse.

772
01:40:26,169 --> 01:40:29,559
I owe the woman something.

773
01:40:31,129 --> 01:40:34,041
I'd be dead without her.

774
01:40:35,009 --> 01:40:38,843
But I'm the one
who loves you, Jackson.

775
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:38,517
The roses were
the most beautiful, deep red.

776
01:41:40,369 --> 01:41:43,679
I miss you and wish
you were sharing this with me.

777
01:41:43,849 --> 01:41:47,728
It would be wonderful
to get a note from you.

778
01:41:47,889 --> 01:41:52,087
The painting here
is unbelievably bad.

779
01:41:52,969 --> 01:41:55,688
How are you, Jackson?

780
01:41:56,569 --> 01:42:00,198
Kiss Gyp for me.
Love, Lee.

781
01:43:58,089 --> 01:44:00,762
It's okay, buddy.

782
01:44:06,609 --> 01:44:09,521
What have you got
there, Mr. Pollock?

783
01:44:09,689 --> 01:44:12,726
I found him hit on the road.

784
01:44:12,969 --> 01:44:15,802
He's a beautiful dog.

785
01:44:16,369 --> 01:44:18,678
You gotta save him.

786
01:44:18,849 --> 01:44:21,727
He's a beautiful dog.

787
01:44:36,969 --> 01:44:40,405
Keep a girl waiting,
why don't you.

788
01:44:42,689 --> 01:44:45,886
This is my friend Edith Metzger.

789
01:45:08,009 --> 01:45:12,958
Just throw your stuff in the back.
We can all fit in the front, I think.

790
01:45:15,889 --> 01:45:17,845
Thanks.

791
01:45:19,449 --> 01:45:22,725
Edith wants to go
to the beach today.

792
01:45:42,409 --> 01:45:45,162
We're all set and ready to go.

793
01:45:47,569 --> 01:45:49,480
You go.

794
01:45:55,409 --> 01:45:58,082
We'll wait for you.

795
01:46:02,809 --> 01:46:04,401
Okay?

796
01:46:20,329 --> 01:46:21,967
Are we going?

797
01:46:22,129 --> 01:46:26,441
He's taking a little nap.
He'll be down in a little bit.

798
01:46:26,689 --> 01:46:29,203
- Is he sick?
- No, he's fine. Come on.

799
01:46:29,369 --> 01:46:32,122
Let's go see the studio.

800
01:46:56,169 --> 01:46:58,046
What's doing for tonight?

801
01:46:58,209 --> 01:47:00,723
I'm invited to Ossorio's...

802
01:47:00,889 --> 01:47:04,120
...for a musicale
or something or other benefit.

803
01:47:04,289 --> 01:47:06,484
That could be fun. Let's go.

804
01:47:06,649 --> 01:47:09,368
I don't want to see
all those people.

805
01:47:09,529 --> 01:47:12,487
Come on, I wanna take
a picture with you.

806
01:47:12,649 --> 01:47:16,688
Edith, take our picture.

807
01:47:25,409 --> 01:47:27,320
Good.

808
01:47:33,209 --> 01:47:35,803
Okay, here we go.

809
01:47:37,329 --> 01:47:39,968
Leave the dishes.

810
01:47:40,129 --> 01:47:43,326
- Get dressed.
- We don't have to go, Jackson.

811
01:47:43,489 --> 01:47:49,166
- Really, you don't have to amuse me.
- Leave the dishes. Get dressed.

812
01:48:08,129 --> 01:48:11,087
What's the matter, Jackson?

813
01:48:15,089 --> 01:48:17,683
Are you all right?

814
01:48:51,249 --> 01:48:54,321
- I'm gonna call for help.
- Don't go in there.

815
01:48:54,489 --> 01:48:57,242
- I don't wanna drive with him.
- Get her back in the car.

816
01:48:57,409 --> 01:49:01,118
Come on, he's fine. I promise.
We're gonna go home.

817
01:49:01,289 --> 01:49:06,522
- I don't wanna drive with him.
- Get her back in the car!

818
01:49:44,329 --> 01:49:46,763
You need to get him to slow down.

819
01:49:46,969 --> 01:49:48,641
Slow down.

820
01:49:48,809 --> 01:49:51,198
Jackson, please.

821
01:49:55,289 --> 01:49:58,440
Tell him he has got
to slow down this car!

822
01:49:58,609 --> 01:50:01,203
Jackson, slow down.

823
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:04,645
- Let me out of your car!
- Edith, shut up!

824
01:50:04,809 --> 01:50:07,721
- Let me out!
- Shut up! Jackson!

825
01:50:07,929 --> 01:50:09,328
No!

826
01:50:09,889 --> 01:50:12,528
- Jackson!
- Let me out of this car!

827
01:50:12,689 --> 01:50:17,399
Get back in the car! Jackson,
you stop this car right now, Jackson!

828
01:50:17,609 --> 01:50:20,521
- Stop, Jackson.
- Stop this car!

829
01:58:05,169 --> 01:58:06,158
