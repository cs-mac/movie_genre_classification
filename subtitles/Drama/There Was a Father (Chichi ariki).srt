1
00:00:08,007 --> 00:00:12,046
Come to me

2
00:00:13,207 --> 00:00:15,277
Come lie beside me

3
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:20,316
And don't deny me your love

4
00:00:23,807 --> 00:00:27,516
Make sense of me

5
00:00:28,887 --> 00:00:31,003
Walk through my doorway

6
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:35,046
Don't hide in the hallway
oh, love

7
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:41,884
Step over

8
00:00:48,287 --> 00:00:51,677
I'll follow you down

9
00:01:16,207 --> 00:01:18,004
In the name of whisky

10
00:01:18,647 --> 00:01:20,524
In the name of song

11
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,044
You didn't look back

12
00:01:23,927 --> 00:01:25,883
You didn't belong

13
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,558
In the name of reason

14
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,198
In the name of hope

15
00:01:31,887 --> 00:01:33,878
In the name of religion

16
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,318
In the name of dope

17
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:38,679
In the name of freedom

18
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,917
You drifted away

19
00:01:42,007 --> 00:01:44,760
To see the sun shining

20
00:01:44,847 --> 00:01:47,077
On someone else's day

21
00:01:57,927 --> 00:01:59,918
In the name of United

22
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:02,478
And the BBC

23
00:02:03,087 --> 00:02:05,078
In the name of Georgie Best

24
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:07,724
And LSD

25
00:02:08,407 --> 00:02:10,875
In the name of the Father

26
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:13,003
And His wife, the Spirit

27
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,523
You said you did not

28
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,163
They said you did

29
00:02:18,687 --> 00:02:20,678
In the name ofjustice

30
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:23,238
In the name of fun

31
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,958
In the name of the Father

32
00:02:26,527 --> 00:02:28,518
In the name of the Son

33
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:43,236
Call to me

34
00:02:44,527 --> 00:02:46,677
No one is listening

35
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:51,636
I'm waiting to hear from you, love

36
00:03:03,807 --> 00:03:04,922
Hello, hello.

37
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:09,159
Good. I never said "thank you''
for taking up our case.

38
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:11,442
Never thought I'd trust
an English person again...

39
00:03:11,527 --> 00:03:13,563
especially a lawyer.

40
00:03:13,647 --> 00:03:18,004
Anyhow, I'll be as accurate as I can
with names, dates and places...

41
00:03:18,087 --> 00:03:20,806
anything that might help
in our defence.

42
00:03:20,887 --> 00:03:23,560
To explain how I happened
to be in England in 1 97 4...

43
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,160
at the time of the bombing...

44
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,478
I'd better take you back
to Northern Ireland, where I come from.

45
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:32,321
Belfast in the early '70s was chaos.

46
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,238
It was strange to see
soldiers on the street--

47
00:03:34,327 --> 00:03:37,319
all of them terrified
of the civilian population...

48
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,477
any one of whom could be
an IRA gunman.

49
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:42,838
I was just a petty thief...

50
00:03:42,927 --> 00:03:44,963
stealing scrap metal.

51
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,515
In Belfast, that was
a dangerous occupation.

52
00:03:49,487 --> 00:03:51,603
Get down, Gerry,
for fuck's sake.

53
00:03:51,687 --> 00:03:52,836
Tommo!

54
00:03:54,327 --> 00:03:56,522
The IRA had already
given me three warnings...

55
00:03:56,607 --> 00:04:00,077
and when a British patrol mistook me for
a gunman, that got me into real trouble.

56
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:02,044
Is he trying to fucking shoot us?

57
00:04:10,607 --> 00:04:13,121
There's a sniper! He's up there!

58
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,120
I can't get a bead on him.

59
00:04:17,207 --> 00:04:19,482
Shoot him
before he fucking kills us!

60
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:37,085
Fucking bastards!

61
00:04:45,247 --> 00:04:48,080
All right, hurry up
and tell Mr Kelly, love.

62
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,841
Two suspects proceeding
back west--

63
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:54,881
Mr Kelly!

64
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:57,400
Bastards!

65
00:04:57,487 --> 00:05:00,365
We have to move the guns.
You go and move the gear.

66
00:05:00,447 --> 00:05:02,517
Right. Everyone out now!
Come on!

67
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:06,280
Get out of the fucking way.
The Brits is after us!

68
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:11,804
The Brits is after us!
The Brits are after us!

69
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:14,845
- In here, in here!
- Gerry!

70
00:05:15,927 --> 00:05:17,997
Come on, come on.
This way, lads.

71
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:21,685
Go! Go! Go, go!

72
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,641
Go on, Gerry!

73
00:05:44,807 --> 00:05:46,763
Looks like they're
coming out of everywhere.

74
00:05:48,207 --> 00:05:50,437
They're right in front of us, boys.

75
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,165
- Who is it?
- It's Conlon.

76
00:05:56,247 --> 00:05:57,316
Grab him!

77
00:06:15,687 --> 00:06:18,406
It's your brother!
Your brother Gerry!

78
00:06:20,367 --> 00:06:21,595
Oh, my God!

79
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,759
Fucking English bastards!

80
00:06:44,047 --> 00:06:46,515
They've started a riot
to cover the sniper.

81
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,404
If we can isolate him,
we can grab him.

82
00:06:48,487 --> 00:06:49,761
Let's go, lads.

83
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,117
Let's go, let's go!
Move it!

84
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:01,040
Get that child out of here now!

85
00:07:03,367 --> 00:07:05,198
Move that child!

86
00:07:12,607 --> 00:07:15,121
Shoot that fucking gas now!

87
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:26,075
Come and fucking get us now,
you bastards!

88
00:07:34,047 --> 00:07:36,356
Let him go, you bastards!

89
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:38,324
Fucking bitch!

90
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:54,399
You okay?

91
00:07:54,487 --> 00:07:56,478
- I got a friend wants to talk to you.
- Oh, fuck's sake.

92
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:59,365
Hey, come on. We can do this
the easy way or the hard way, all right?

93
00:07:59,447 --> 00:08:01,438
Let's be smart.
Come on.

94
00:08:03,767 --> 00:08:05,086
They're taking
your brother away!

95
00:08:07,527 --> 00:08:09,085
Where are you going now?

96
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:10,964
- We weren't robbing no houses.
- Don't fuck with me.

97
00:08:11,047 --> 00:08:12,685
Suddenly you're a good boy?

98
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:15,201
- Have you been robbing houses again?
- We weren't robbing houses.

99
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,596
Search him.
Did you get away all right?

100
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:19,518
- Aye.
- Who was it?

101
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:21,245
- It was those two.
- Those two?

102
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:24,603
- That isn't mine. It isn't.
- Peter?

103
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:27,360
Shoot the bastards!
They're always robbing our houses!

104
00:08:27,447 --> 00:08:28,596
Fuck you!

105
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,046
Daddy, Daddy,
the IRA has our Gerry.

106
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:37,878
Go on, show me.

107
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:40,356
Yo, give him that.

108
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:42,597
Right, Tommo, lad.

109
00:08:51,287 --> 00:08:55,644
Tommo, get their trousers down.
I fucking warned you, Danny.

110
00:08:55,727 --> 00:08:57,843
- Peter, we didn't do nothing, honestly.
- Give you a break?

111
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:00,236
What's she saying?
What are we supposed to have done?

112
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:02,477
This is what I'm gonna give you.
Now get your trousers down.

113
00:09:02,567 --> 00:09:04,956
You just ran into the house
where we had all that gear.

114
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:07,607
What was I supposed to know?
I was trying to get away from the Brits.

115
00:09:07,687 --> 00:09:09,439
'Cause you were
stealing lead again, weren't you?

116
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:10,960
You were stealing lead.

117
00:09:11,047 --> 00:09:13,242
- Shut up, Danny!
- They were shooting at us.

118
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,079
- Get the strides down now.
- Why?

119
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:17,965
'Cause you'll get cloth in the wound
and lose your leg, that's why.

120
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,163
Come on, Peter. Give us a few slaps.
You don't have to shoot us.

121
00:09:21,247 --> 00:09:23,078
- Fuck's sake.
- Fucking Tarzan.

122
00:09:23,167 --> 00:09:24,885
Look at the balls on him!

123
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,996
Jesus! Christ!
Peter! Peter!

124
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:32,601
They're only young.
Give 'em a chance.

125
00:09:32,687 --> 00:09:35,201
We were just trying
to scare some sense into them.

126
00:09:35,287 --> 00:09:37,084
He was stealing lead again.

127
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,283
He ran through one of our houses
and started all this shit.

128
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:41,005
Did you start all this?

129
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:45,885
He'll never survive
in this town. Never.

130
00:09:45,967 --> 00:09:47,844
This is the last time.
You two blow!

131
00:09:47,927 --> 00:09:49,519
And, Danny, it's the last time.

132
00:09:49,607 --> 00:09:51,325
- The same for you, Conlon.
- Pull up your trousers.

133
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,045
Come back here!

134
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:57,803
- We've never had a thief in our family.
- We've never had nothing in our family.

135
00:09:57,887 --> 00:10:01,277
- Will you get a job?
- You know we can't get jobs.

136
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,524
I have a job.

137
00:10:04,607 --> 00:10:06,723
Do you want me to work
as a bookie's clerk?

138
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:11,085
- I want you to have some respect.
- Aye, respect for who?

139
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:13,720
For yourself.

140
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,236
We're getting you out of here.

141
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,238
He'll do no growing up
in England, Giuseppe.

142
00:10:30,327 --> 00:10:32,682
No family life there.

143
00:10:32,767 --> 00:10:35,042
Oh, give over, Ma.

144
00:10:35,127 --> 00:10:37,846
I'm gonna miss the boat.
What's that?

145
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:40,487
- Sausages for your Aunt Annie.
-Jesus Christ, Ma!

146
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:42,364
- Here you are, son.
- Here, let me do that.

147
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:49,157
All right, I'm ready.
Where are you going?

148
00:10:49,247 --> 00:10:50,396
I'll walk with you.

149
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,125
Do you not trust me
to get on the boat?

150
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,001
I'm sure I'll be back
when I'm a millionaire, Gran.

151
00:10:56,087 --> 00:10:57,998
Good luck. God bless.

152
00:10:58,087 --> 00:10:59,839
I love you, son.

153
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,202
- Cheerio, Gerry.
- Behave yourself, Ann.

154
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,686
Cheerio, Gerry.

155
00:11:03,767 --> 00:11:05,041
Bye, Bridie.

156
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:21,078
He's gone now forever.

157
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:23,727
I'll be surprised if he lasts a month.

158
00:11:23,807 --> 00:11:27,117
Did I ever tell you
the time I jumped ship?

159
00:11:28,327 --> 00:11:30,602
Jumped overboard
about 200 yards out to sea...

160
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:32,837
swam back to this
godforsaken place.

161
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:39,962
Why did you swim back?

162
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:41,958
There was a woman involved.

163
00:11:43,567 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, aye?

164
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:49,484
It was when I was healthy,
before you were born.

165
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:01,918
What was her name?

166
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:04,475
Aye, you know her name.
You know your own mother's name.

167
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:08,321
Sarah.
Sarah Maguire she was.

168
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:11,205
Then she had the misfortune
to change it to Conlon.

169
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:23,916
Boarding all passengers.

170
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:26,805
All second-class passengers
boarding now.

171
00:12:38,327 --> 00:12:41,842
Go and live.
Go and live, son.

172
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,804
That's the best advice
I can give you.

173
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:53,723
Remember,
honest money goes further.

174
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:56,485
Honest money goes further.

175
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,239
A bird in the hand is worth
two in the bush.

176
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,636
Never look a gift horse
in the mouth.

177
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:03,241
He'd a cliche
for every occasion.

178
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:07,485
I'll give you a call.

179
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,159
Right, son.

180
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:14,204
I ran up the gangplank
to get away from him...

181
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:16,517
and then I suddenly
felt bad about it.

182
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:18,438
I decided to turn back...

183
00:13:18,527 --> 00:13:22,076
to call him Giuseppe
for the first time in my life.

184
00:13:23,127 --> 00:13:25,516
When I turned around,
he had already walked away.

185
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,556
- I just called after him.
- Good-bye, Da!

186
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:38,485
Then I met my old schoolmate,
Paul Hill.

187
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,321
Little did I know that after meeting him
my life would change forever.

188
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:49,919
You're under arrest.

189
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,803
Fuck's sake, Gerry!

190
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:58,197
- Still a head case.
-James Bond, license to kill.

191
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,878
Look at you-- you're a fucking nervous
wreck. What's the matter with you?

192
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:03,605
I'm glad to get outta Belfast.

193
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:11,084
Where're you going?

194
00:14:11,167 --> 00:14:13,965
- I'm going to London. What about you?
- The same.

195
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:16,083
I need a drink.

196
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:19,603
Aye, I'm skint.
I'll let you buy me one.

197
00:14:31,407 --> 00:14:34,240
Once upon a time
you dressed so fine

198
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:36,966
You threw the bums a dime
in your prime

199
00:14:38,047 --> 00:14:39,639
Didn't you

200
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,485
I arrived in London
on the 26th ofJune.

201
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:47,161
My mother had given me
the address of my Aunt Annie...

202
00:14:47,247 --> 00:14:50,319
but I had an invitation to a hippie
commune from my old friend...

203
00:14:50,407 --> 00:14:52,557
Paddy Armstrong.

204
00:14:52,647 --> 00:14:54,956
Jesus, Gerry, we've been
walking around for hours.

205
00:14:55,047 --> 00:14:57,402
- It's only that big on the map.
- But it's a map, Gerry.

206
00:14:57,487 --> 00:14:59,443
London's a big place, you know.

207
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:07,323
What I was really looking for
was free love and dope.

208
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:11,317
I think it's this way.

209
00:15:26,487 --> 00:15:28,557
Paddy?

210
00:15:29,367 --> 00:15:31,801
- Yeah, what is it?
- We're looking for Paddy.

211
00:15:31,887 --> 00:15:34,276
- Paddy who?
- Paddy from Belfast. Paddy Armstrong.

212
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:41,165
- There's some people here to see you!
- Who is it?

213
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:42,566
Some Irish boys.

214
00:15:42,647 --> 00:15:44,717
Jesus! Gerry Conlon.

215
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,365
What about you, Paddy?

216
00:15:46,447 --> 00:15:48,324
Thought you was the drug squad.
Come on in.

217
00:15:54,167 --> 00:15:55,441
There you go.

218
00:15:59,447 --> 00:16:01,244
Welcome to Xanadu.

219
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:04,201
Hi.

220
00:16:06,487 --> 00:16:08,478
Jesus fucking wept.

221
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,717
Neat, ain't it?

222
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,479
Deptford Jim.

223
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:14,922
- Paul Hill. Gerry Conlon from home.
- Right.

224
00:16:18,087 --> 00:16:19,918
Before you can enter the circle...

225
00:16:20,007 --> 00:16:23,716
you have to have
the rite of passage.

226
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:25,604
Open your mouth.

227
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,243
I enjoyed that.

228
00:16:40,967 --> 00:16:42,525
They can't stay.

229
00:16:42,607 --> 00:16:44,518
- There's not enough room.
-Jim!

230
00:16:44,607 --> 00:16:49,442
Our rule:
No property. No law.

231
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:51,483
-Just love.
- All right, let's vote on it.

232
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:52,841
If you want Gerry and--

233
00:16:52,927 --> 00:16:54,804
- What's your name?
- Paul.

234
00:16:56,407 --> 00:17:00,002
We're gonna call you
"Saddest Moon.''

235
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,317
- Fuck off.
- Right?

236
00:17:04,407 --> 00:17:07,046
If you want Gerry and Saddest Moon
to stay, raise your hands.

237
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:10,163
Four, five, six--

238
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:12,602
- Put your hand up, Paddy.
- Right.

239
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:15,121
- Eight.
- Looks like we're staying then.

240
00:17:22,247 --> 00:17:23,680
What shall we call you then?

241
00:17:25,207 --> 00:17:27,801
You can call me "Wild One.''

242
00:17:27,887 --> 00:17:30,401
Here, hold on. Come here.

243
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:32,159
Get off, all right?

244
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,238
What's the fucking problem?

245
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:37,803
They have dead pig in here.

246
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,166
Just some sausages.

247
00:17:40,247 --> 00:17:42,397
We're all vegetarians here.

248
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:44,637
I am a vegetarian.
We're both vegetarians.

249
00:17:44,727 --> 00:17:47,161
I was just taking them sausages
to me Auntie Annie's.

250
00:17:47,247 --> 00:17:50,796
I have to be around there now. I'll be
back in a few minutes, all right?

251
00:17:51,887 --> 00:17:53,445
Be back in a few minutes.

252
00:17:55,287 --> 00:17:56,515
Piggy.

253
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,199
And Porky.

254
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,321
Is she related to the
Royal Family or something?

255
00:18:06,407 --> 00:18:08,318
Aye, she's fifth in line
to the throne.

256
00:18:11,047 --> 00:18:14,483
Ferguson's sausages-- only good thing
that came out of that godforsaken place.

257
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,159
- Would you like some more?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

258
00:18:16,247 --> 00:18:19,364
- We better make tracks.
- Won't you stay? I've the bed made up.

259
00:18:19,447 --> 00:18:21,881
You're very kind, but we need
a bit of space, Auntie Annie.

260
00:18:21,967 --> 00:18:23,878
We're forming a band
and that there.

261
00:18:23,967 --> 00:18:26,162
Aye. A rock band.

262
00:18:28,767 --> 00:18:29,995
Where are you staying?

263
00:18:31,007 --> 00:18:33,646
- The address, you mean?
- Uh-huh.

264
00:18:35,567 --> 00:18:37,876
- Fillmore.
- Fillimore.

265
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:41,357
Fillimore Road.
It's number 60...

266
00:18:41,447 --> 00:18:44,757
something--
the number dropped off the door.

267
00:18:47,447 --> 00:18:49,324
What do you mean,
the number dropped off the door?

268
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,601
Well, would you let me have it
when you find out what it is?

269
00:18:53,687 --> 00:18:56,520
- Aye.
- And would you phone your mother?

270
00:18:56,607 --> 00:18:59,246
Aye.
There's only one problem.

271
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:03,519
It doesn't have a phone.

272
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:11,884
Hello, Marian. Any problems?

273
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:13,764
- Is it all there?
- Yeah.

274
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,837
Okay.
We're in business.

275
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:19,600
Watch the cracks.
Watch the cracks.

276
00:19:19,687 --> 00:19:22,440
It's not fair.
Their skirts are covering the cracks.

277
00:19:22,527 --> 00:19:24,199
He's cheating!

278
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,515
- I'm a referee!
- He's cheating.

279
00:20:13,487 --> 00:20:15,523
- That wasn't too far away, was it?
- Is that a bomb, Paddy?

280
00:20:15,607 --> 00:20:17,598
It's getting more like home.

281
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:21,480
Hello? Hold on, hold on.

282
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,922
Giuseppe. Giuseppe.
Long-distance call.

283
00:20:24,007 --> 00:20:25,918
- What?
- Long-distance call.

284
00:20:28,927 --> 00:20:30,246
- Go ahead.
- Hello?

285
00:20:30,327 --> 00:20:32,204
- Ask him for the money.
- Hey, Da.

286
00:20:32,287 --> 00:20:33,925
- It's Gerry speaking.
- Son.

287
00:20:34,007 --> 00:20:35,998
- Hi. How are you doing?
- I'm fine. How are you?

288
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:38,203
It's been six weeks
since you've been in touch.

289
00:20:38,287 --> 00:20:40,323
I know. Sorry about that.
I've been a bit busy.

290
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,763
It's just your ma's a bit worried,
you know. You still going to Mass?

291
00:20:43,847 --> 00:20:46,839
- Aye, every Sunday. Like clockwork.
- Good.

292
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:50,602
- Are you working?
- I have a couple of things going here.

293
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:52,279
Ah, good.
And are you safe?

294
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:55,200
- How do you mean?
- From all the bombs.

295
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,040
Aye, you could just hear them
in the distance like, but--

296
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:00,880
Sorry about that.

297
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:03,242
- Are you stuck?
- How do you mean, Da?

298
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,806
Are you short of cash?

299
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,447
Uh, no. No, I'm flush
at the moment.

300
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:10,041
No problem.
No, I have plenty of money.

301
00:21:10,127 --> 00:21:12,402
All right.
And, Gerry, keep in touch.

302
00:21:12,487 --> 00:21:15,797
- Aye. All right. Bye-bye, Da.
- All right, son. I'll tell your ma--

303
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,159
Bye.

304
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:22,839
Sorry about that.

305
00:21:22,927 --> 00:21:25,395
We've enough for chips.

306
00:21:28,447 --> 00:21:30,563
Sorry, we'd only
enough money for two chips.

307
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:32,160
Are you all right?

308
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:33,965
What?

309
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:35,878
There's bombs everywhere.
People have been hurt.

310
00:21:35,967 --> 00:21:39,004
There they are.
It's the Irish.

311
00:21:39,087 --> 00:21:40,918
Bringing all their troubles
over here again.

312
00:21:41,007 --> 00:21:45,637
Aye, it's all right when it happens
over in Belfast. You fucking prick!

313
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:49,402
I've seen people killed
in front of my fucking eyes!

314
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:53,082
- You stupid fucking prick!
- Go home! Fuck you!

315
00:21:53,167 --> 00:21:55,317
I don't fucking believe this.
I'm getting out of here.

316
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:57,716
- Are you coming, Paddy?
- Where are you gonna sleep?

317
00:21:57,807 --> 00:22:00,560
Ah, no problem. We'll sleep
in the park or something.

318
00:22:03,527 --> 00:22:05,245
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Take care.

319
00:22:05,327 --> 00:22:08,046
- Mind your fucking manners!
- Prick.

320
00:22:08,127 --> 00:22:11,483
Troops have entered
the Ardoyne area of West Belfast...

321
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:15,082
since the collapse of the provisional
IRA cease-fire over the weekend.

322
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,317
Yeah, I'm watching it.

323
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:22,083
Civilians have been evacuated, and there
are reports of casualties in many areas.

324
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:24,965
- Both sides are blaming each other--
- Okay, I'll take care of it.

325
00:22:26,847 --> 00:22:29,998
That's it. 8:00 tonight.

326
00:22:30,687 --> 00:22:32,120
No warning.

327
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:44,001
That's my place.
Youse are sitting there too long.

328
00:22:44,087 --> 00:22:48,763
CB-- Charlie Burke.
That's me.

329
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,600
I carved my initials
with this penknife.

330
00:22:51,687 --> 00:22:55,202
No problem, Charlie.
No problem. Whatever you say.

331
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:58,484
Closing the park.
Park closing now.

332
00:22:58,567 --> 00:23:01,081
- Easy with the feet there, Charlie.
- It's a big bench, you know?

333
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,283
There's room for three of us here.

334
00:23:04,527 --> 00:23:06,438
You're Irish too, aren't you?

335
00:23:08,647 --> 00:23:11,639
I come over here
when I was about your age.

336
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,161
Did you ever think
of going home, Charlie?

337
00:23:14,247 --> 00:23:16,317
Ah, shit.

338
00:23:16,407 --> 00:23:19,160
There's nothing for me
over there now.

339
00:23:22,127 --> 00:23:26,484
- Closing the park!
- Could you lend us a few shillings?

340
00:23:26,567 --> 00:23:28,364
I was gonna ask you the same.

341
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,842
- Gerry, we've no money left.
- It's all I have.

342
00:23:38,927 --> 00:23:41,760
Well, now, like I wouldn't like
to take all your money.

343
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:43,838
No problem.
Catch you again, Charlie.

344
00:23:43,927 --> 00:23:47,203
- Come on. It's not even 8:00 yet.
- All right, all right.

345
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:02,319
We must'vejust said good night
to Charlie Burke when the bomb went off.

346
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:06,036
All we were concerned about was
where we were gonna sleep that night.

347
00:24:06,127 --> 00:24:08,118
We'd no money
in our pockets.

348
00:24:08,207 --> 00:24:11,279
We hadn't even the bus fare to Guildford
even if we'd known where it was.

349
00:24:13,407 --> 00:24:16,365
No fucking way I'm going
back to Belfast.

350
00:24:16,447 --> 00:24:18,039
I tell you that.

351
00:24:21,447 --> 00:24:24,200
- Hey, blondie.
- Hey, sexy.

352
00:24:24,287 --> 00:24:26,357
- You dropped something.
- Back off, paddy.

353
00:24:26,447 --> 00:24:28,324
She's outta your league.

354
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:29,681
Here.

355
00:24:37,567 --> 00:24:40,035
It's her fucking keys.
I'm going in.

356
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,800
We should give 'em back, Gerry.
Put 'em through the letter box.

357
00:24:42,887 --> 00:24:45,082
Put the keys back
in the letter box, Gerry.

358
00:25:39,807 --> 00:25:41,798
Jesus Christ,
how much money is there?

359
00:25:45,487 --> 00:25:48,638
I got £700 from
the hooker's apartment.

360
00:25:48,727 --> 00:25:51,366
I did feel a little bit
guilty about that.

361
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:55,446
We spent that night
in a hotel.

362
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:59,679
The next day we went and bought
the same clothes-- the same trousers...

363
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:02,406
samejackets,
even the same shoes.

364
00:26:14,367 --> 00:26:16,927
Hey, mister,
has your coat got fleas?

365
00:26:40,687 --> 00:26:44,316
Who are those two gorgeous
women in the kitchen?

366
00:26:45,807 --> 00:26:50,642
- Did you miss me, Bridie?
- Look at Gerry. He's a hippie!

367
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:51,796
Daddy, look at the money!

368
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:53,843
- Do you want it?
- Oh, my God!

369
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:55,963
Do you wanna be in my gang?

370
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,323
Yes, Gerry, I wanna be in your gang.
I wanna be in your gang.

371
00:26:59,407 --> 00:27:01,477
- Over here.
- Take it easy.

372
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:05,082
Steady. Calm it down.
Just calm it down.

373
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:07,886
It's my money!
It's mine!

374
00:27:07,967 --> 00:27:09,719
Calm it down. Stop it.

375
00:27:09,807 --> 00:27:11,479
- It's my money! He gave it to me!
- Stop that!

376
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:12,886
Stop that!

377
00:27:18,407 --> 00:27:21,001
And they were always talking about
the troubles, were they?

378
00:27:22,287 --> 00:27:25,120
Yeah.
Especially Paul Hill.

379
00:27:25,207 --> 00:27:29,166
He was always talking about Belfast,
the IRA, all that stuff.

380
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:33,967
Look, all I'm saying is this:

381
00:27:34,047 --> 00:27:37,756
They had a lot of money,
and Conlon went back to Belfast.

382
00:27:37,847 --> 00:27:40,441
- Come along, into the car.
- What the fuck is going on?

383
00:27:42,567 --> 00:27:44,558
That was a bloody disgrace,
them shooting you.

384
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:46,922
- Aye.
- Did it hurt you, Danny?

385
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:50,317
It wasn't too bad. The bullet bounced
off the kneecap and out the other side.

386
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:51,840
Five people are dead...

387
00:27:51,927 --> 00:27:55,237
and 7 5 seriously injured
as a result of the IRA 's....

388
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:58,842
no-warning bomb attack
on a Guildford pub.

389
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:02,317
Parliament has passed
the Prevention of Terrorism Act...

390
00:28:02,407 --> 00:28:06,002
which allows terrorist suspects to be
held by police for up to seven days.

391
00:28:06,087 --> 00:28:08,760
Seven days. Geez.

392
00:28:08,847 --> 00:28:11,725
It's the same here.
Seven days. No difference.

393
00:28:11,807 --> 00:28:15,925
...around London
and arrested 1 9 suspects.

394
00:28:16,007 --> 00:28:18,123
Gerry, there's your shoes.

395
00:28:18,207 --> 00:28:20,767
Our reporter spoke to Commander Robert
Dixon of the antiterrorist squad...

396
00:28:20,847 --> 00:28:22,565
about those arrests.

397
00:28:22,647 --> 00:28:24,922
We can't pretend
people won't be inconvenienced.

398
00:28:25,007 --> 00:28:26,884
Some of them may not deserve it.

399
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:30,516
That's why we shall use these powers
as selectively as possible.

400
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:40,727
Get up out of bed,
you dirty, murdering bastard!

401
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:42,081
Hands above your head!

402
00:28:44,047 --> 00:28:46,003
I don't know what the fuck youse are
looking for, mister, but I'm not it.

403
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:49,602
Gerry, your coat.
He's done nothing.

404
00:28:49,687 --> 00:28:51,086
- Inside, sir.
- He's not political.

405
00:28:51,167 --> 00:28:52,964
I have a right to speak to my son.

406
00:28:55,167 --> 00:28:56,441
Keep calm, Gerry.

407
00:28:58,647 --> 00:29:01,115
Get back in.
Get back inside.

408
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:06,525
It's all right.
It's all right.

409
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,635
- Where are we going?
- You'll find out soon enough.

410
00:29:25,927 --> 00:29:29,522
- Where'd he get this money?
- I don't know.

411
00:29:31,567 --> 00:29:34,240
They have no right
to take him to England.

412
00:29:36,887 --> 00:29:38,479
Slow down a bit.

413
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:33,080
Look, I don't have a fucking clue
what this is about.

414
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,923
I've done nothing wrong.

415
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,763
When can I go back to Belfast?

416
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:02,645
Next time you see Belfast, they'll be
flying day trips to the moon.

417
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:05,562
I always wanted
to be an astronaut.

418
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,678
What are you charging me with?

419
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:21,440
You're being held
under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

420
00:31:21,527 --> 00:31:22,596
What?

421
00:31:22,687 --> 00:31:26,282
We can hold you for seven days
and seven nights without charging you.

422
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:29,757
- When was I a fucking terrorist?
- Were you part of that, Gerry?

423
00:31:32,047 --> 00:31:34,959
And that.
You proud of that?

424
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:39,279
- And that.
- Why are you showing me these people?

425
00:31:41,087 --> 00:31:43,806
No marks!
Don't mark him! Don't mark him!

426
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:45,479
Are you fucking proud of that?

427
00:31:46,687 --> 00:31:49,679
Look at that young,
pretty girl there!

428
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:53,077
- Now look at her!
- You're out of your fucking minds!

429
00:31:53,167 --> 00:31:54,964
- Do you?
- You're out of your fucking minds!

430
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,717
The children know there's
something terrible going on.

431
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:03,686
- And you're not making it easier.
- I haven't the strength for this.

432
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:06,758
If he killed innocent people,
I haven't the strength for it.

433
00:32:06,847 --> 00:32:09,122
Listen, I know that child.
I carried that child.

434
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:11,198
If you're not gonna
believe in him, I will.

435
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:13,039
You think he's innocent?

436
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:15,482
When your son walked through that door
looking like a bloody circus clown...

437
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,523
do you think he had murder
in his eyes?

438
00:32:18,567 --> 00:32:20,523
Happy birthday to you

439
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:23,724
- It's a surprise.
- Shut up. Shut up!

440
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,437
When will Daddy be back?

441
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:42,483
He'll be back
in a couple of days.

442
00:32:44,287 --> 00:32:46,198
Why did they put
Gerry in jail?

443
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:47,879
It's a mistake.

444
00:32:49,327 --> 00:32:52,046
I'm on my way over
to bring him back home.

445
00:32:52,127 --> 00:32:54,322
Why are you getting
narky again?

446
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:57,838
Are we touching a sore spot?

447
00:32:57,927 --> 00:33:00,043
Name all the places you stayed
while you were in England.

448
00:33:01,207 --> 00:33:02,925
I told you about 1 00 times.

449
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:04,281
Then tell us again!

450
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:10,886
I stayed at the squat
most of the time.

451
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:12,764
I was a couple of nights
at my Auntie Annie's...

452
00:33:12,847 --> 00:33:15,361
and one night at the hotel
after I robbed the money.

453
00:33:31,007 --> 00:33:33,567
Male. Late forties.

454
00:33:33,647 --> 00:33:36,036
Who taught you
how to make the bomb, Gerry?

455
00:33:37,207 --> 00:33:39,402
I never made any bombs.

456
00:33:39,487 --> 00:33:41,045
Did Annie make the bomb,
Gerry?

457
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:45,126
Is Annie Marian, Gerry?

458
00:33:47,287 --> 00:33:48,481
Is Annie Marian?

459
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:52,561
- Annie who?
- Annie Maguire!

460
00:33:52,647 --> 00:33:55,605
My Aunt Annie?

461
00:33:55,687 --> 00:33:58,645
Oh, aye, Annie made the bomb,
and Mother Teresa planted it.

462
00:33:58,727 --> 00:34:00,922
What was Carole Richardson's
part in this operation?

463
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,077
Are you Marian?

464
00:34:06,607 --> 00:34:08,802
What?

465
00:34:08,887 --> 00:34:10,115
Are you Marian?

466
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:13,802
She had nothing
to do with it.

467
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,520
This man comes into my house.
He puts a gun to my head.

468
00:34:20,607 --> 00:34:22,518
He says I done Guildford.

469
00:34:23,607 --> 00:34:27,361
I left Belfast to get away
from people like him.

470
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:30,996
Show me what you want me to sign.
I have an alibi for that night.

471
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:38,847
What are you showing me
these for?

472
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:43,439
Gerry told us you did it.

473
00:34:43,527 --> 00:34:45,438
Then he's a fucking liar.

474
00:34:45,527 --> 00:34:49,805
Armstrong drove the car.
Who was the woman in the back?

475
00:34:52,807 --> 00:34:54,604
I don't know.

476
00:34:54,687 --> 00:34:57,838
But you were
in the Ford Cortina.

477
00:34:57,927 --> 00:35:00,805
But you were
in the red Ford Cortina.

478
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:03,003
He'll get used to your methods,
and then he'll clam up.

479
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:08,597
I told you I was in the Cortina.
I told you it was a taxi.

480
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:10,962
No. The taxi was
a Toyota Corolla.

481
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:13,322
When can I ring home?

482
00:35:13,407 --> 00:35:17,844
- Let's start again. Who's Marian?
- Was it someone Irish?

483
00:35:17,927 --> 00:35:21,522
Why are you getting narky again?
Touching a sore spot? What was her name?

484
00:35:21,607 --> 00:35:25,156
- Nothing to do with what, Gerry?
- Talk to me.

485
00:35:25,247 --> 00:35:26,805
You're evading the truth, Gerry.
What was her name?

486
00:35:26,887 --> 00:35:31,403
Two little girls asked me,
"Why was Daddy blown up?''

487
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:33,478
Who taught you how
to make the bomb, Gerry?

488
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,041
Talk to me.

489
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:47,558
He'll do what he's told.

490
00:35:48,847 --> 00:35:50,678
Look at him.
He's a lying bastard.

491
00:35:50,767 --> 00:35:53,486
He's a right fucking comedian.
Aren't you, Gerry?

492
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,956
- Who's Marian?
- I don't know what--

493
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:59,164
I'm getting fucking bored with this.
Who is Marian?

494
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm gonna keep on asking until
you give me a fucking answer!

495
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:04,886
- Who is Marian?
- I don't know!

496
00:36:04,967 --> 00:36:07,606
Yes, you fucking do!
Bollocks! Who is Marian?

497
00:36:12,727 --> 00:36:14,399
We know who Marian is.

498
00:36:25,007 --> 00:36:27,601
- Are you the man in charge?
- Yes, I am.

499
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,440
For fuck's sake,
tell 'em to stop hurting me.

500
00:36:34,927 --> 00:36:36,838
I swear to God...

501
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,805
I know where I was
at the time of the bombings.

502
00:36:43,727 --> 00:36:47,959
I was with a madman
called Charlie Burke.

503
00:36:49,047 --> 00:36:50,719
Have you any other alibis?

504
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:54,038
I have told youse before...

505
00:36:54,127 --> 00:36:56,641
I was with Paul Hill
most of the day.

506
00:37:04,767 --> 00:37:06,917
Tell Gerry Conlon
like you said you would.

507
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:17,441
- Who's this?
- Gerry Conlon.

508
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:24,039
Have you anything
to say to him?

509
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:28,565
I've cleared my conscience.

510
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:30,797
I advise you to do the same.

511
00:37:45,287 --> 00:37:46,879
There's your statement.

512
00:37:49,407 --> 00:37:51,318
I didn't do this.

513
00:37:52,407 --> 00:37:55,001
I didn't fucking do this!

514
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,526
Please believe me.

515
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:05,724
What are you doing to me?

516
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:13,237
They wouldn't hold him
if he hadn't done something.

517
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:17,558
- Gerry is no angel.
- I know that.

518
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:19,558
He needs a strong hand.

519
00:38:23,927 --> 00:38:26,999
You're all under arrest.

520
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,521
- No, no, don't. Don't hurt the child!
- Put your hands up!

521
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,724
You're all being held under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

522
00:38:39,807 --> 00:38:44,039
- Is Hill leading us up the garden path?
- I don't know.

523
00:38:50,087 --> 00:38:52,317
I can make him confess.

524
00:38:52,407 --> 00:38:54,159
Why don't you have
a word in his ear?

525
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:57,080
You're from the same town.
He'll understand you.

526
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:59,078
Will you have the bomber?

527
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:01,317
Our job is
to stop the bombing.

528
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,843
I'm gonna shoot your da.

529
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:10,402
What did you say to me?

530
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:15,766
Little Bridie'll
have no daddy.

531
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:17,997
I'm gonna shoot Giuseppe.

532
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:29,998
He's threatening to shoot my da!

533
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:32,999
He's threatening to kill my da!

534
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:34,805
Look at him!
Look at him!

535
00:40:36,207 --> 00:40:37,845
He's a madman!

536
00:40:37,927 --> 00:40:41,715
I think you're hallucinating.
Nobody's gonna harm your father.

537
00:40:43,487 --> 00:40:46,001
Get him back.
Get him back.

538
00:40:47,087 --> 00:40:49,965
He threatened to kill my da.

539
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,003
Nobody's gonna kill your father.

540
00:40:52,087 --> 00:40:55,045
- You mad bastard!
- Take it easy, son. Take it easy.

541
00:40:56,807 --> 00:40:58,638
He's not gonna harm your father.

542
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:02,681
Come on, let it all out.

543
00:41:02,767 --> 00:41:04,678
Let it all out--
all that hatred.

544
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,357
You hate us, don't you?

545
00:41:11,447 --> 00:41:14,041
You hate us enough
to bomb and maim.

546
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:17,244
That is the trouble.
You let it all out. Come on.

547
00:41:17,327 --> 00:41:20,239
- I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do.

548
00:41:20,327 --> 00:41:23,717
I can see it in your face.
I can see all that hatred.

549
00:41:23,807 --> 00:41:26,275
So why don't you just
let it off your chest...

550
00:41:26,367 --> 00:41:28,801
before it starts to mess up
with your mind?

551
00:41:35,047 --> 00:41:36,844
Give me the fucking statement.

552
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:41,045
For fuck's sake,
give me the statement.

553
00:41:42,327 --> 00:41:45,000
Give me a fucking pen.

554
00:41:52,167 --> 00:41:56,638
Right, that's my fucking name there.
You can write what you like.

555
00:41:58,367 --> 00:42:01,120
All right, nice and easy.
Come on.

556
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:04,756
- Paul! What's going on?
- Gerry!

557
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:07,361
They stuck a fucking gun
in my mouth!

558
00:42:07,447 --> 00:42:09,165
So I told 'em
a lot of bullshit!

559
00:42:09,247 --> 00:42:12,319
- Why did you give 'em my fucking name?
- I'm sorry!

560
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:16,844
It's fucking mad!
It'll be laughed out of fucking court!

561
00:42:16,927 --> 00:42:19,282
It'll be laughed
out of fucking court!

562
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:22,086
The four of us were split up.

563
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,920
I was taken to
South London Remand Centre.

564
00:42:25,007 --> 00:42:27,521
You can check the dates, Gareth.

565
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:36,764
Kill that fucker!

566
00:42:39,247 --> 00:42:43,206
You fucking son
of an Irish cow!

567
00:42:47,247 --> 00:42:50,205
Kick that Irish fucking ass!

568
00:42:50,247 --> 00:42:52,238
- What is that?
- Delousing.

569
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:54,084
I don't have fucking lice.
I don't want that.

570
00:42:54,167 --> 00:42:56,078
You have no choice, mate.

571
00:42:56,167 --> 00:42:58,556
You'll never clean the scum
off that--

572
00:42:58,647 --> 00:43:01,798
Okay, Conlon.
Go see the room, shall we?

573
00:43:07,007 --> 00:43:09,043
Come on, Mr Conlon.

574
00:43:14,327 --> 00:43:16,238
We got your son.

575
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:19,566
Let's go.

576
00:43:21,247 --> 00:43:24,247
Da!

577
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:25,999
Is that you, son?

578
00:43:26,087 --> 00:43:30,763
- Da, here!
- Where are you?

579
00:43:34,207 --> 00:43:36,801
Don't harm my father.
Don't harm my father!

580
00:43:36,887 --> 00:43:38,320
- Are you all right, son?
- Don't kill him!

581
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:47,247
Come on, move along.
Move along. Come on, you.

582
00:43:47,247 --> 00:43:49,920
- Fuck you!
- Shut up, you!

583
00:43:51,247 --> 00:43:53,283
- Shut up!
- On the floor!

584
00:43:53,567 --> 00:43:57,242
You look fucking brave now.

585
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:07,247
What the fuck
are you doing here, Da?

586
00:44:07,247 --> 00:44:10,557
I come over to your Aunt Annie's
to get you a lawyer.

587
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:12,247
They arrested everybody
in the house.

588
00:44:12,247 --> 00:44:14,247
What?

589
00:44:14,247 --> 00:44:17,247
- What for, fuck's sake?
- Conspiracy to murder.

590
00:44:17,247 --> 00:44:19,636
Oh, no.
Oh, fuck's sake, no. Geez.

591
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:28,996
Did you do it?
Did you do it, son?

592
00:44:29,087 --> 00:44:30,600
No, I did not!

593
00:44:35,247 --> 00:44:38,045
Of course I fucking
didn't do it, fuck's sake!

594
00:44:48,927 --> 00:44:51,236
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- What?

595
00:44:55,607 --> 00:44:57,882
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Like what?

596
00:44:57,967 --> 00:44:59,923
Why do you always follow me?

597
00:45:03,007 --> 00:45:05,919
Why do you always follow me
when I do something wrong?

598
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,760
Why can't you follow me
when I do something right?

599
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:11,236
- What are you talking about?
- What am I talking about?

600
00:45:11,327 --> 00:45:13,795
- I'm talking about the medal.
- What medal?

601
00:45:13,887 --> 00:45:16,606
What fucking medal?
What fucking medal?

602
00:45:16,687 --> 00:45:20,965
The only fucking medal that was ever
in our house. That fucking medal.

603
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:23,766
The medal I won at football.

604
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,202
And you sat on the sidelines
shouting instructions...

605
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:27,680
like you could only see
what I was doing--

606
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,247
you couldn't even
fucking play football--

607
00:45:30,247 --> 00:45:32,966
and you could only see
what I was doing wrong.

608
00:45:33,047 --> 00:45:35,117
I could never do anything
good enough for you.

609
00:45:35,207 --> 00:45:38,005
And after the game,
you came up to me and said...

610
00:45:38,087 --> 00:45:41,124
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?''

611
00:45:41,207 --> 00:45:44,643
And I walked away from you, remember?
I walked away into the dressing room.

612
00:45:44,727 --> 00:45:48,003
You followed me in there and said again,
"Gerry, did you foul the ball?''

613
00:45:48,087 --> 00:45:50,317
All the other fathers were in there
laughing at you...

614
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:52,247
calling you "Poor Giuseppe.''

615
00:45:52,247 --> 00:45:55,956
And I ran out, and I hid,
and I wrote your name on the ground--

616
00:45:56,047 --> 00:45:57,639
your stupid Giuseppe fucking name--

617
00:45:57,727 --> 00:46:00,161
I wrote it in the dirt,
and I fucking pissed on it!

618
00:46:02,167 --> 00:46:04,247
I pissed on it...

619
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:06,966
because I did foul the ball.

620
00:46:07,047 --> 00:46:10,960
What did it matter? We won.
For once in our lives, we won.

621
00:46:11,047 --> 00:46:13,925
You ruined that medal for me! I took it
to the pawn, and they laughed at me.

622
00:46:14,007 --> 00:46:16,567
- They wouldn't give me 50 pence for it.
- This is shock.

623
00:46:16,647 --> 00:46:20,925
And that's when I started to rob,
to prove that I was no good.

624
00:46:21,007 --> 00:46:23,247
- Delayed shock.
- Never mind delayed shock.

625
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,239
I've been like this
since I was seven.

626
00:46:26,287 --> 00:46:29,040
I remember Mammy said to me,
"Don't upset Giuseppe. He's not well.''

627
00:46:29,127 --> 00:46:32,247
Oh, dear Lord, he's not well.
So we'd tiptoe around the house.

628
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:36,638
Like this, tiptoeing around the house.
"Not well, you know. He's not well.''

629
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:39,247
Then I got Holy Communion.
I thought I was eating you alive.

630
00:46:39,247 --> 00:46:42,125
Is it my fault you weren't well?

631
00:46:42,207 --> 00:46:44,846
Why did you have to be sick
all your life, Giuseppe?

632
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,043
What'd you have to be sick
all your life for?

633
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:50,676
When that mad bastard out there
threatened to shoot you, I was happy.

634
00:46:50,767 --> 00:46:52,837
I swear to God.
Honest to God, I was happy.

635
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:55,600
I was delighted! You know why?
Because finally it was all over.

636
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:58,804
It was over!
You see?

637
00:46:58,887 --> 00:47:01,162
And then I knew I was bad.

638
00:47:01,247 --> 00:47:04,125
I knew I was bad then, you see,
so I started to cry.

639
00:47:04,207 --> 00:47:06,247
I started to tell lies--
the same fucking lies...

640
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:09,239
I've been telling
all my gobshite fucking life.

641
00:47:15,247 --> 00:47:18,247
- That means words don't mean nothing.
- Stop this.

642
00:47:18,247 --> 00:47:20,920
Only this time,
I got everyone into trouble.

643
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:23,965
But it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm
no good anyhow. It doesn't matter.

644
00:47:24,047 --> 00:47:26,720
Keep away from me. You've been
following me all your life.

645
00:47:26,807 --> 00:47:31,005
- Are you here deliberately?
- No. Stop it.

646
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:33,999
You call that a fucking dig, huh?

647
00:47:34,087 --> 00:47:38,205
Do you call that a fucking dig?
Hit me harder. Hit me fucking harder!

648
00:47:38,247 --> 00:47:40,238
- Stop it. Calm down.
- For once in your fucking life!

649
00:47:40,327 --> 00:47:42,557
- Hit me like a real father!
-Just calm down. Stop it.

650
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:53,083
Just relax.

651
00:47:54,687 --> 00:47:56,245
Try to relax.

652
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:05,915
It's okay.

653
00:48:10,087 --> 00:48:12,965
It's not your fault,
son, all right?

654
00:48:13,047 --> 00:48:16,084
Everything's gonna be
all right.

655
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,965
Okay.
All right, son.

656
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:22,803
Visitor for Conlon!

657
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:27,203
Two on for visit!

658
00:48:36,007 --> 00:48:37,998
No touching.

659
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:42,603
- Everybody else was allowed to touch.
- IRA, closed visits. No contact.

660
00:48:53,647 --> 00:48:55,763
Why are you doing this to us?

661
00:48:58,007 --> 00:49:00,805
You have your father
locked up in prison for murder.

662
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:02,286
Speak up, please.

663
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:06,606
- It's not my fault, Ma.
- Take it easy, Sarah.

664
00:49:10,887 --> 00:49:13,879
I swear to God,
I've done nothing wrong.

665
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:16,242
Why did you sign
a confession, son?

666
00:49:16,327 --> 00:49:19,125
He did it
to protect me, love.

667
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:22,085
You have a good son there.
That's all you need to know.

668
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:25,079
You didn't sign anything
yourself, did you, Giuseppe?

669
00:49:25,167 --> 00:49:28,125
The only thing I said
was I wanted to see you.

670
00:49:28,207 --> 00:49:31,916
Look, they've no statement
nor evidence against me.

671
00:49:32,007 --> 00:49:36,239
I'll be out and home soon.
Sure I'm only visiting here myself.

672
00:49:37,687 --> 00:49:39,837
I'll be able to help out
Gerry while I'm in here.

673
00:49:42,687 --> 00:49:44,564
Danny's dead, Gerry.

674
00:49:45,887 --> 00:49:46,956
What?

675
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:52,239
They found his body
on waste ground.

676
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:55,319
The IRA said he was
an incurable thief.

677
00:49:58,327 --> 00:50:01,683
I sent a Mass card
from the family.

678
00:50:05,007 --> 00:50:08,124
This one'll not go to school
since you've been away.

679
00:50:08,207 --> 00:50:10,004
Hey, you go to school
for your mammy.

680
00:50:10,087 --> 00:50:11,759
Yes, Daddy.

681
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,236
Daddy, when will you be home?

682
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:20,557
I've pressed your Sunday suits
for the trial.

683
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:22,842
You make sure
and look your best now, son.

684
00:50:25,327 --> 00:50:28,876
But is there nitro
or was there not nitro?

685
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:32,039
Yes, there are
traces of nitro.

686
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:34,243
But are they all positive?

687
00:50:34,287 --> 00:50:37,723
Well, yes, on six of them.

688
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:41,846
- Who'd we miss?
- The aunt, Aggie-- Annie.

689
00:50:41,927 --> 00:50:44,566
But her rubber glove
showed a faint trace.

690
00:50:45,687 --> 00:50:47,245
And the children?

691
00:50:48,327 --> 00:50:49,680
Positive.

692
00:50:51,887 --> 00:50:54,560
The results may not
be good enough for court.

693
00:50:54,647 --> 00:50:57,923
Your word will be
good enough for the court.

694
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:01,606
Yes, sir.

695
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:08,156
Kill the bastards!
Kill 'em!

696
00:51:14,167 --> 00:51:15,839
Shoot the bastards!

697
00:51:29,887 --> 00:51:32,242
Call number one.

698
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:37,877
- Let's go.
-Jesus, it's a nightmare, Giuseppe.

699
00:51:37,967 --> 00:51:41,801
Just stay calm, be on your best
behaviour, and this'll be behind us soon.

700
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:44,125
That's it, come on.

701
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:50,839
It'll be all right.

702
00:52:00,687 --> 00:52:03,201
All rise.

703
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:26,244
Sir Michael Hagerty will present
the case on behalf of the Crown.

704
00:52:30,887 --> 00:52:34,641
There are two series of charges here,
ladies and gentlemen.

705
00:52:34,727 --> 00:52:38,037
The four defendants in front...

706
00:52:38,127 --> 00:52:43,121
are charged with 1 1 counts in relation
to the explosion of the Guildford pub...

707
00:52:43,207 --> 00:52:45,277
and the murders of five people.

708
00:52:45,567 --> 00:52:48,559
The Crown will show
that these were the bombers.

709
00:52:48,647 --> 00:52:50,797
The seven defendants behind...

710
00:52:50,887 --> 00:52:55,278
are charged with the possession
of explosives, not charged with murder.

711
00:52:55,567 --> 00:52:57,876
The Crown's case
against them is...

712
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:01,164
that they are a support network
for the bombers, and as such...

713
00:53:01,247 --> 00:53:05,240
- should be considered independent.
- Control yourself. Pay attention.

714
00:53:05,287 --> 00:53:09,724
My first witness is
Inspector Robert Dixon.

715
00:53:09,807 --> 00:53:13,247
I swear by Almighty God that the
evidence I give shall be the truth...

716
00:53:13,247 --> 00:53:15,238
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth.

717
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:22,726
Inspector, why do you believe
these four are the bombers?

718
00:53:24,247 --> 00:53:29,116
First Hill, then Conlon,
Armstrong, Richardson...

719
00:53:29,207 --> 00:53:31,084
confessed to the bombing.

720
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:32,839
They are the IRA's ASU.

721
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:35,600
Can you explain ASUs for us?

722
00:53:35,687 --> 00:53:38,599
Active Service Unit.
They are the elite of the IRA...

723
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:40,598
who carry out
the bombings and the shootings.

724
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:44,600
Often they are combat veterans with
experience of shooting at soldiers...

725
00:53:44,687 --> 00:53:46,837
and planting explosives.

726
00:53:46,927 --> 00:53:49,919
And the others--
Annie Maguire and her family?

727
00:53:50,007 --> 00:53:52,157
They are the IRA's support network.

728
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:57,116
Their families and friends store
the weapons and explosives...

729
00:53:57,207 --> 00:54:00,882
and they provide
what we call " safe houses.''

730
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:03,242
Thank you, Inspector.

731
00:54:05,087 --> 00:54:07,237
These people were arrested
two days...

732
00:54:07,287 --> 00:54:10,245
after the Prevention
of Terrorism Act was introduced.

733
00:54:10,327 --> 00:54:12,238
That's correct.

734
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:15,279
Can you explain, please, the powers
that this gives to the police?

735
00:54:15,567 --> 00:54:18,247
It permits us to hold
suspected terrorists...

736
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,000
for a period of up to seven days.

737
00:54:21,087 --> 00:54:23,157
Quite extraordinary powers
in a democracy.

738
00:54:23,247 --> 00:54:26,205
Quite difficult, I would think for
the police to resist the temptation...

739
00:54:26,247 --> 00:54:28,602
- to deal forcibly with people.
- Objection.

740
00:54:28,687 --> 00:54:32,247
People they suspect of the biggest
bombing campaign on British mainland...

741
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:35,239
- since the Second World War.
- Objection. My lord, I really must--

742
00:54:35,287 --> 00:54:38,962
- Get to the point!
- Now, this bombing campaign...

743
00:54:39,047 --> 00:54:42,881
struck deep into the British people's
sense of security.

744
00:54:42,967 --> 00:54:46,164
The people looked to you,
Inspector, to find those responsible.

745
00:54:46,247 --> 00:54:47,236
Yes.

746
00:54:48,247 --> 00:54:50,203
You must have been under
the most intense pressure.

747
00:54:50,247 --> 00:54:52,238
That's my job.

748
00:54:52,287 --> 00:54:55,245
Now, all of the defendants claim--

749
00:54:55,327 --> 00:54:59,081
including young Patrick Maguire,
aged just 1 4--

750
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,158
Patrick,
would you stand up, please?

751
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:05,715
Thank you.
All of the defendants claim...

752
00:55:05,807 --> 00:55:09,846
that they were subjected to physical and
mental abuse while in police custody.

753
00:55:11,847 --> 00:55:14,156
They were never harmed
in any way.

754
00:55:14,247 --> 00:55:16,886
He's fucking lying!
They beat the shite out of us!

755
00:55:19,247 --> 00:55:20,236
Silence!

756
00:55:22,887 --> 00:55:25,082
Please believe us!
They beat us!

757
00:55:25,807 --> 00:55:27,206
Just be quiet.

758
00:55:27,247 --> 00:55:29,247
Sit them down!

759
00:55:29,247 --> 00:55:31,203
Silence in the court!

760
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:36,317
Mr Conlon says...

761
00:55:36,607 --> 00:55:40,043
that you pulled him by the hair
and squeezed his testicles.

762
00:55:40,127 --> 00:55:42,766
I never even spoke to Mr Conlon.

763
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:44,838
I hope you burn in hell, Dixon.

764
00:55:44,927 --> 00:55:46,645
Silence!

765
00:55:46,727 --> 00:55:50,879
Mr Hill says the police sat astride him
and put a gun in his mouth.

766
00:55:52,247 --> 00:55:54,556
There was no pressure of any kind.

767
00:55:54,647 --> 00:55:57,320
You can go and fuck yourself,
you lying fucking bastard!

768
00:55:57,607 --> 00:55:58,835
Order! Order in court!

769
00:55:58,927 --> 00:56:02,283
Inspector, in the case
of the four main defendants...

770
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,683
you have no corroborating evidence
of any kind.

771
00:56:04,767 --> 00:56:08,123
I have the confessions of four obvious
terrorists. What more do you want?

772
00:56:08,207 --> 00:56:11,802
Well, nitroglycerine
is a highly toxic substance.

773
00:56:11,887 --> 00:56:13,923
It's when the substance
to be tested--

774
00:56:14,007 --> 00:56:16,567
After a few weeks,
we were bored out of our minds--

775
00:56:16,647 --> 00:56:18,558
just messed around
and that there.

776
00:56:20,087 --> 00:56:22,726
They must've been
desperate for evidence.

777
00:56:22,807 --> 00:56:27,119
They produced Annie's washing-up gloves
like a rabbit out of a hat at one point.

778
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:30,085
Then it was my turn
to take the stand.

779
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:33,204
Mr Conlon,
did you bomb Guildford?

780
00:56:34,247 --> 00:56:36,203
No, I didn't.

781
00:56:36,247 --> 00:56:39,080
The police claim that you were in
Guildford on the night of the bombing.

782
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,964
Can you tell us where you were?

783
00:56:41,047 --> 00:56:44,039
I was in a park in London
at that time.

784
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:46,925
- Who with?
- With Paul Hill sitting there.

785
00:56:48,167 --> 00:56:50,556
You met somebody else that night,
about 8:00 p.m.

786
00:56:50,647 --> 00:56:55,247
- Aye, I met a man called Charlie Burke.
- And who is he?

787
00:56:55,247 --> 00:56:59,604
He was just a fellow,
a homeless guy that we met in the park.

788
00:56:59,687 --> 00:57:01,917
Why do you remember
this man so clearly?

789
00:57:03,167 --> 00:57:06,955
I was thinking that if I didn't get out
of London fast, I would end up like him.

790
00:57:07,047 --> 00:57:10,247
- You told this to the police?
- Aye.

791
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:13,284
- What did they say?
- They said he didn't exist.

792
00:57:13,567 --> 00:57:18,004
Mr Conlon, why did you confess
to the Guildford bombing?

793
00:57:19,287 --> 00:57:22,247
They beat me...

794
00:57:22,247 --> 00:57:24,158
and then they threatened
to kill my father.

795
00:57:24,247 --> 00:57:28,923
- Will you repeat that please?
- They terrorized me for seven days.

796
00:57:29,007 --> 00:57:31,282
After that,
they threatened to kill my father.

797
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:34,127
I'd have fucking signed anything
after that.

798
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:37,681
- Excuse my language.
- Thank you.

799
00:57:39,927 --> 00:57:43,636
You expect this jury to believe
that decorated police officers...

800
00:57:43,727 --> 00:57:46,958
would risk their career
and their reputation...

801
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,247
by threatening your father?

802
00:57:49,247 --> 00:57:51,807
I don't expect them to believe it
by the time you finish with them...

803
00:57:51,887 --> 00:57:53,923
but it happens to be truth.

804
00:57:54,007 --> 00:57:56,237
You're an honest man,
aren't you, Mr Conlon?

805
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,839
I like to think so.

806
00:57:58,927 --> 00:58:03,159
You've told us you remember
this Charlie Burke very well.

807
00:58:04,207 --> 00:58:05,879
Aye.

808
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:09,721
Do you remember telling the police
anything else about that night?

809
00:58:10,967 --> 00:58:13,686
Let me refresh your memory.
You told Inspector Dixon...

810
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:16,281
that you had committed
a robbery on that night.

811
00:58:16,567 --> 00:58:18,637
Now do you remember?

812
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:23,126
Aye.

813
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:27,917
- Who did you rob?
- Robbed a hooker.

814
00:58:28,007 --> 00:58:31,238
- You robbed a prostitute?
- Aye.

815
00:58:31,287 --> 00:58:35,280
And we are expected to believe a man
who claims he stole from a prostitute...

816
00:58:35,567 --> 00:58:39,247
before we would believe ten police
officers who stood here on oath...

817
00:58:39,247 --> 00:58:41,044
and called you a liar?

818
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:44,836
That was the truth.

819
00:58:44,927 --> 00:58:48,247
I'm bound to say I don't find
you very convincing.

820
00:58:48,247 --> 00:58:50,238
Thank you, Mr Conlon.

821
00:58:54,567 --> 00:58:58,003
Why didn't you tell me
that you'd stole from that woman?

822
00:59:00,127 --> 00:59:02,243
You should've called me.
I would've sent the money.

823
00:59:09,607 --> 00:59:12,724
Are you gonna be a thief
and a liar all your life?

824
00:59:15,247 --> 00:59:19,240
Standing up in that witness box,
making faces to your mates.

825
00:59:31,607 --> 00:59:34,963
At least you told the truth
in there. That'll stand you.

826
00:59:41,287 --> 00:59:43,243
Are you not going
to eat that sausage?

827
00:59:48,007 --> 00:59:50,601
They put a gun in my mouth...

828
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:55,078
and made me confess
to a murder I didn't commit.

829
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:57,806
So I said I did the big bombing...

830
00:59:57,887 --> 01:00:01,247
and named anybody I knew
who was not in the IRA.

831
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:03,247
Not in the IRA?

832
01:00:03,247 --> 01:00:06,239
- Definitely not in the IRA.
- Why?

833
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,240
You know why.

834
01:00:14,167 --> 01:00:17,000
I just wanted to show
how ridiculous it all was.

835
01:00:17,087 --> 01:00:20,966
Inspector, the defendant Conlon
presented an alibi--

836
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,247
One Charlie Burke.

837
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:26,717
That name did appear in Mr Conlon's
statement. We investigated it.

838
01:00:26,807 --> 01:00:29,605
We couldn't find any trace
of such a person.

839
01:00:29,687 --> 01:00:32,121
And there was this question
of the robbery of a prostitute.

840
01:00:32,207 --> 01:00:35,244
No robberies were reported
in that area that night.

841
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:38,717
At the start of this trial,
I shook Gerry Conlon's hand.

842
01:00:40,247 --> 01:00:43,247
Subsequently, I was deeply shocked
when a fellow attorney came to me...

843
01:00:43,247 --> 01:00:45,807
and asked me if I was now
going to wash my hand.

844
01:00:47,327 --> 01:00:50,125
In my long legal career,
I cannot remember a case...

845
01:00:50,207 --> 01:00:52,243
where emotions have
been so charged.

846
01:00:53,247 --> 01:00:55,247
It falls to me now
to appeal to you...

847
01:00:55,247 --> 01:00:58,247
the members of the jury,
not to get caught up in this...

848
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:00,966
tide of mass hysteria.

849
01:01:01,047 --> 01:01:06,247
Inspector Dixon admits there are scores
of inconsistencies in the confessions.

850
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:09,603
My clients contend that
they were forced to confess...

851
01:01:09,687 --> 01:01:12,918
through brutality
and intimidation.

852
01:01:14,607 --> 01:01:16,247
Now, they may be foolish...

853
01:01:16,247 --> 01:01:20,320
petty thieves,
even drug abusers...

854
01:01:20,607 --> 01:01:25,920
but they are not the ruthless bombers
who have terrorized Britain for months.

855
01:01:27,207 --> 01:01:31,086
You should find these young people
not guilty.

856
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:34,284
- Bollocks!
- Okay, let's go.

857
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:37,081
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Move it!

858
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:39,044
- Move it!
- Hands off!

859
01:01:45,247 --> 01:01:46,805
Ladies and gentlemen...

860
01:01:49,007 --> 01:01:52,044
like my learned colleague
in the defence...

861
01:01:52,127 --> 01:01:55,915
I would caution you not
to be swayed by your emotions.

862
01:01:56,007 --> 01:02:00,046
The four people
you see in the front...

863
01:02:00,127 --> 01:02:04,040
are one of the most cunning and
cruel criminal conspiracies...

864
01:02:04,127 --> 01:02:07,247
ever to set foot on English soil.

865
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:10,876
Now, here are the facts
of this case:

866
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:12,923
Inspector Dixon...

867
01:02:13,007 --> 01:02:15,202
a decorated officer
of great expertise...

868
01:02:15,247 --> 01:02:18,247
acting on reliable information
and good detective work...

869
01:02:18,247 --> 01:02:21,247
arrested Paul Hill...

870
01:02:21,247 --> 01:02:25,877
who, guilt-ridden by the shame
of his crime, confessed.

871
01:02:25,967 --> 01:02:29,801
That confession led the police
to the ringleader, Conlon...

872
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:32,247
and his terrorist family--

873
01:02:32,247 --> 01:02:37,116
his aunt, Annie Maguire,
the experienced bomb maker...

874
01:02:37,207 --> 01:02:39,880
who wore rubber gloves
when handling explosives...

875
01:02:39,967 --> 01:02:42,879
in the kitchen
of her home in Harlesden.

876
01:02:42,967 --> 01:02:45,765
She even allowed her children
to handle explosives--

877
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:48,919
Vincent, aged 1 6,
Patrick, 1 4--

878
01:02:49,007 --> 01:02:53,842
who did not-- could not--
know any better.

879
01:02:53,927 --> 01:02:55,963
Giuseppe Conlon,
her brother-in-law...

880
01:02:56,047 --> 01:02:58,925
the courier who arrived
with more explosives.

881
01:02:59,007 --> 01:03:03,205
Armstrong and his dupe
Richardson, who carried the bomb.

882
01:03:03,247 --> 01:03:05,681
Now, these are the people who,
in a panic...

883
01:03:05,767 --> 01:03:09,999
had to dispose
of the nitroglycerine...

884
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,920
and that is what sealed
their fate.

885
01:03:13,007 --> 01:03:17,239
How do we know this?
Because the truth was on their hands.

886
01:03:20,807 --> 01:03:25,562
It is a story written
in the blood of their victims.

887
01:03:25,647 --> 01:03:28,605
You have seen some of those
who survived...

888
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:31,759
their callous disregard
for human life.

889
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:36,159
It is now your duty
to protect society from them.

890
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:40,240
I am confident that
that is what you will do.

891
01:04:16,247 --> 01:04:18,158
Have you reached a verdict?

892
01:04:19,687 --> 01:04:21,120
Yes, we have, my lord.

893
01:04:23,087 --> 01:04:26,716
- How do you find the defendants?
- Guilty as charged.

894
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:32,038
Hang the Irie bastards!

895
01:04:34,607 --> 01:04:37,041
Order! Silence!

896
01:04:38,927 --> 01:04:40,679
String 'em up!

897
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:50,247
Gerard Patrick Conlon.

898
01:04:51,607 --> 01:04:53,279
Stand up.

899
01:04:55,887 --> 01:04:59,880
I feel it is my duty
to wonder aloud...

900
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:04,757
why you were not charged
with treason to the Crown...

901
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:08,965
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging--

902
01:05:09,047 --> 01:05:12,596
a sentence I would have had
no difficulty in passing...

903
01:05:12,687 --> 01:05:15,281
in this case.

904
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:18,643
I sentence you
to life imprisonment...

905
01:05:20,167 --> 01:05:22,158
and I instruct
that you shall serve...

906
01:05:22,247 --> 01:05:25,239
a minimum of 30 years.

907
01:05:26,727 --> 01:05:28,240
Take him down.

908
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:41,640
Help me.

909
01:05:51,007 --> 01:05:53,237
Paul Michael Hill.

910
01:05:56,007 --> 01:06:00,205
In my view, your crime
is such that...

911
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:02,602
life shall mean life.

912
01:06:02,687 --> 01:06:07,078
Annie Maguire,
I recommend you serve 1 4 years!

913
01:06:07,167 --> 01:06:09,237
- What have I done, for Christ's sake?
- Take her down!

914
01:06:10,247 --> 01:06:13,956
- Giuseppe Conlon, 1 2 years.
- No, my husband's innocent!

915
01:06:14,047 --> 01:06:15,247
Lord have mercy on you!

916
01:06:15,247 --> 01:06:18,239
Patrick Joseph Armstrong,
30 years.

917
01:06:24,247 --> 01:06:27,762
Carole Richardson,
30 years.

918
01:07:23,887 --> 01:07:27,721
Our case was so insane that if you
made it up, nobody would believe it.

919
01:07:27,807 --> 01:07:30,924
Look, Gareth, I know people say
that I'm a compulsive storyteller...

920
01:07:31,007 --> 01:07:33,247
and nobody believed
a word I said in court...

921
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,922
but Charlie Burke did exist-- he's not
just a figment of my imagination.

922
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:43,795
Sorry.

923
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:58,247
We were shipped off
to Park Royal Prison...

924
01:07:58,247 --> 01:08:02,763
an old Victorian fortress where the
most dangerous criminals were held...

925
01:08:02,847 --> 01:08:05,247
in the maximum-security wing.

926
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,238
- Place of birth.
- Belfast.

927
01:08:07,287 --> 01:08:09,005
Then you're British.

928
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,247
This is your home
for the rest of your life.

929
01:08:10,247 --> 01:08:12,886
So accept it and get on with it.
Right, come this way.

930
01:08:12,967 --> 01:08:14,241
The chief warder, Barker...

931
01:08:14,327 --> 01:08:17,683
gave us blue denim uniforms
with yellow stripes.

932
01:08:17,767 --> 01:08:19,325
We were Category A--

933
01:08:19,607 --> 01:08:22,804
the highest-security class along
with the rapists and murderers.

934
01:08:22,887 --> 01:08:25,242
My father said
we'd fight for an appeal...

935
01:08:25,287 --> 01:08:27,323
but I didn't want to know
about the legal system.

936
01:08:28,927 --> 01:08:31,043
- I'm going back to the cell.
- Come on. Follow me.

937
01:08:42,247 --> 01:08:43,316
Come on, Gerry.

938
01:08:45,247 --> 01:08:48,717
Hey, Ronnie.
There's those Irish bastards, Ronnie.

939
01:08:50,647 --> 01:08:51,921
Irish scum.

940
01:08:52,007 --> 01:08:54,805
My name's Giuseppe Conlon.
I'm an innocent man.

941
01:08:54,887 --> 01:08:57,162
So is my son.

942
01:08:57,247 --> 01:08:58,885
We shouldn't even be in here.

943
01:08:58,967 --> 01:09:01,037
Get that fucking scum
off my floor.

944
01:09:04,727 --> 01:09:06,558
I said, knock it off!

945
01:09:25,247 --> 01:09:28,557
- They must know they've made a mistake.
- No, they don't.

946
01:09:28,647 --> 01:09:32,322
The proof of our innocence
must be there in the evidence.

947
01:09:32,607 --> 01:09:34,325
We have to fight 'em
to get an appeal.

948
01:09:36,247 --> 01:09:40,035
- I'll speak to Father Wilson.
- Speak to everybody.

949
01:09:40,127 --> 01:09:42,800
We'll write letters from in here.
Start a campaign.

950
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,242
Have they been
treating you all right?

951
01:09:45,287 --> 01:09:47,118
Aye, fine. Fine.

952
01:09:47,887 --> 01:09:49,240
Have they, son?

953
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,083
Aye. No problem.

954
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,681
Landing officers, exercise.

955
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:12,283
Forgot the dessert spoons.

956
01:10:14,167 --> 01:10:15,919
There we go.

957
01:10:26,327 --> 01:10:28,318
These chips are not bad.

958
01:10:35,047 --> 01:10:38,278
- Now don't you despair, son.
- Never mind about "don't despair.''

959
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:39,966
What?

960
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:42,800
I mean, we're innocent,
we can't even go out of the cell.

961
01:10:44,247 --> 01:10:49,196
You're better off being guilty.
At least you get some respect.

962
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,841
Landing officers
on the threes for exercise.

963
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:55,122
You can have my chips.

964
01:11:37,767 --> 01:11:40,247
Gerry, man.

965
01:11:40,247 --> 01:11:42,283
Problem? You all right?

966
01:11:45,247 --> 01:11:47,247
How you like your new home?

967
01:11:47,247 --> 01:11:50,239
Bombing of pillar-box,
Kensington High Street.

968
01:11:50,327 --> 01:11:52,247
Bombing of pillar-box,
Talbot Lodge.

969
01:11:52,247 --> 01:11:54,158
Bombing of naval club.

970
01:11:54,247 --> 01:11:57,247
Bombing of Aldershot Railway Station.
Attempted murder of Edward Heath.

971
01:11:57,247 --> 01:11:59,761
Murder of Ross McWhirter.

972
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:03,886
Possession of firearms,
Balcombe Street, December 6, 1 9 7 5.

973
01:12:03,967 --> 01:12:06,037
And the Guildford pub bombings.

974
01:12:07,887 --> 01:12:11,084
You have innocent people
in jail for that.

975
01:12:13,727 --> 01:12:15,240
Take him out.

976
01:12:39,127 --> 01:12:40,719
He did it.

977
01:12:40,807 --> 01:12:43,799
Where's all the missing pieces?

978
01:12:47,807 --> 01:12:50,685
We eat it up, man.

979
01:12:52,127 --> 01:12:54,197
Before my woman
send it in here, right...

980
01:12:54,247 --> 01:12:57,000
she have it dipped
in liquid acid--

981
01:12:57,087 --> 01:12:59,806
LSD, man.

982
01:12:59,887 --> 01:13:03,243
We've been dropping the British Empire
for the last six months.

983
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:05,887
You want to fly?
Pick a country.

984
01:13:05,967 --> 01:13:09,164
Fuck's sake, don't give me Northern
Ireland. I don't want a bad trip.

985
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:12,284
Try Nepal, man.
Take you to the Himalayas.

986
01:13:29,047 --> 01:13:31,880
See the dragon.

987
01:13:57,647 --> 01:14:00,764
Lights out in 1 5 minutes.
1 5 minutes.

988
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:14,115
Are you praying
for the Seventh Cavalry?

989
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:18,247
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

990
01:14:18,247 --> 01:14:21,956
Blessed art thou amongst women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb,Jesus.

991
01:14:22,047 --> 01:14:23,844
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners...

992
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:26,202
now and at the moment of our death.
Amen.

993
01:14:26,247 --> 01:14:28,158
That's not funny, Gerry.

994
01:14:29,967 --> 01:14:34,677
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

995
01:14:36,247 --> 01:14:38,238
Blessed art thou among women...

996
01:14:38,327 --> 01:14:41,046
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb,Jesus.

997
01:14:44,247 --> 01:14:46,078
Holy Mary, mother of God...

998
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:49,557
pray for us sinners, now and
at the hour of our death. Amen.

999
01:14:58,247 --> 01:15:00,238
Are you on drugs?

1000
01:15:12,247 --> 01:15:16,798
Look, Da, I'll be older than you are
now when I get out of this place.

1001
01:15:18,287 --> 01:15:20,118
If I get out.

1002
01:15:23,607 --> 01:15:27,600
- Are you listening to me?
- I'm not talking to you.

1003
01:15:27,687 --> 01:15:29,803
Now who's being childish?

1004
01:15:31,887 --> 01:15:34,720
I haven't had a sensible word
out of you for two weeks.

1005
01:15:36,807 --> 01:15:38,240
That stuff'll kill you.

1006
01:15:39,807 --> 01:15:41,604
Sure I'm dead anyway.

1007
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:50,604
Look, I'm sorry. I'll not
take it again so long as you live.

1008
01:15:51,767 --> 01:15:53,883
Are you happy now?

1009
01:15:55,687 --> 01:15:57,598
No.

1010
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:59,643
Why not?

1011
01:16:02,607 --> 01:16:05,075
I don't want you to take it
whether I live or die.

1012
01:16:09,247 --> 01:16:10,885
Jesus Christ.

1013
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,118
All right. I'll do nothing
to annoy you in your grave.

1014
01:16:21,287 --> 01:16:23,118
Now are you happy?

1015
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,237
Is that a promise?

1016
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:30,236
Aye.

1017
01:16:32,007 --> 01:16:33,235
Maybe.

1018
01:16:40,807 --> 01:16:44,004
Gerry, man,
check out your friend.

1019
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,163
He look like the real thing.

1020
01:16:51,247 --> 01:16:52,726
Come on.

1021
01:17:05,847 --> 01:17:07,246
- Excuse me.
- All right.

1022
01:17:11,647 --> 01:17:13,603
Let's have a talk.

1023
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,043
We have to eat in the cells.

1024
01:17:20,127 --> 01:17:21,879
See ya later.

1025
01:17:24,287 --> 01:17:26,243
Gerry, come on.

1026
01:17:51,607 --> 01:17:53,837
Morning, paddy.

1027
01:17:58,807 --> 01:18:00,081
Yes!

1028
01:18:07,847 --> 01:18:09,041
Come on!

1029
01:18:09,967 --> 01:18:11,241
Yes, man, Gerry!

1030
01:18:22,247 --> 01:18:26,001
This one, this one, this one,
1 4 days solitary! Lock up!

1031
01:18:27,127 --> 01:18:28,640
Lock up!

1032
01:18:28,727 --> 01:18:32,163
He'll be all right.
He'll be back in a couple of days.

1033
01:18:41,887 --> 01:18:43,798
I'm worried about Bridie.

1034
01:18:46,567 --> 01:18:47,795
Why?

1035
01:18:49,287 --> 01:18:52,006
She's dyed her hair blonde.

1036
01:18:53,327 --> 01:18:56,239
Well, she's only young.

1037
01:18:59,047 --> 01:19:01,641
She's wearing a dog collar.

1038
01:19:08,687 --> 01:19:12,043
There's a fella chained to it.
He's got one on too.

1039
01:19:15,687 --> 01:19:17,598
Well...

1040
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:20,155
as long as she's happy.

1041
01:19:31,087 --> 01:19:32,725
Lunch break.

1042
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:37,558
Yes, Gerry, man!
That's right!

1043
01:19:37,647 --> 01:19:39,842
Gerry's a bad boy!

1044
01:19:39,927 --> 01:19:42,316
Put the Englishman
under heavy, heavy manners.

1045
01:19:42,607 --> 01:19:46,998
Yes, sir. Go on, boy.
Kick out them clods, yes?

1046
01:19:47,087 --> 01:19:50,318
This is Joe McAndrew.
He has something important to tell you.

1047
01:19:50,607 --> 01:19:52,040
Hello, Mr Conlon.

1048
01:19:54,607 --> 01:19:56,598
I'm watching you.

1049
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:10,157
What is it?

1050
01:20:10,247 --> 01:20:13,000
I'm the one who planted
the Guildford bomb, Mr Conlon.

1051
01:20:16,727 --> 01:20:18,957
Did you tell the police that?

1052
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:22,084
Yes, I did.

1053
01:20:22,167 --> 01:20:26,240
- But we haven't heard a thing.
- See what he has to say, Da.

1054
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:28,721
Go on.

1055
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:32,959
I told them.
They know the truth.

1056
01:20:33,047 --> 01:20:35,800
They can't afford to face it.

1057
01:20:35,887 --> 01:20:39,084
It's a war.
You're one if its innocent victims.

1058
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,247
I'm sorry for your trouble.

1059
01:20:41,247 --> 01:20:43,317
Don't be sorry for us.

1060
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:45,882
You should be sorry
for the people you killed.

1061
01:20:47,647 --> 01:20:50,684
It was a military target,
a soldier's pub.

1062
01:20:50,767 --> 01:20:55,247
They were innocent people,
God's children.

1063
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:59,877
Look, I'll do all I can
to help you while you're in here.

1064
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:01,241
We don't need your help.

1065
01:21:03,127 --> 01:21:05,595
I'd appreciate it
if you'd leave us alone.

1066
01:21:06,967 --> 01:21:08,320
Whatever you say.

1067
01:21:11,247 --> 01:21:13,238
I'm sorry about that.

1068
01:21:17,207 --> 01:21:19,243
What was that all about?
You mind your fucking manners.

1069
01:21:19,287 --> 01:21:23,963
What? Manners to him? I don't want
any part of him, or his ways.

1070
01:21:24,047 --> 01:21:27,247
At least he fights back, which is
more than you ever did in your life.

1071
01:21:27,247 --> 01:21:29,841
- What are you talking about?
- Do you remember Lydon Hill?

1072
01:21:29,927 --> 01:21:32,725
You used to ride me up
on your bike up Lydon Hill.

1073
01:21:32,807 --> 01:21:34,798
And then one day
you couldn't make it to the top...

1074
01:21:34,887 --> 01:21:39,247
and I hopped off and looked back,
and your face was all red.

1075
01:21:39,247 --> 01:21:41,283
- Remember that?
- Aye.

1076
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:46,556
It was working in the paint shed
done that to you.

1077
01:21:46,647 --> 01:21:47,921
What?

1078
01:21:48,007 --> 01:21:51,602
It was the fumes from working
in the paint shed done that to you.

1079
01:21:51,687 --> 01:21:54,155
Never mind jumping off the ferry,
swimming back to Mammy.

1080
01:21:54,247 --> 01:21:57,762
It was the one job a Catholic can get,
and you wouldn't even fight back then.

1081
01:21:57,847 --> 01:22:02,967
Go on outside.
Play with your newfound friend.

1082
01:22:03,047 --> 01:22:07,199
All I'm saying is that you've been
a victim. It's time you fought back.

1083
01:22:07,247 --> 01:22:08,999
- Get out of my sight.
- I'm going.

1084
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:15,237
This is the only way it'll work.
We have no alternative.

1085
01:22:32,247 --> 01:22:35,284
- Well, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

1086
01:22:36,847 --> 01:22:39,645
- They didn't do it.
- They all did it.

1087
01:22:43,247 --> 01:22:45,238
I'm going back to Belfast.

1088
01:22:51,807 --> 01:22:55,641
After the fight, nobody stopped us
going out in the yard to exercise.

1089
01:22:55,727 --> 01:22:59,083
I felt brilliant.
Joe explained things to me.

1090
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:02,159
He explained how the Brits
never left anywhere without a fight...

1091
01:23:02,247 --> 01:23:05,637
how they had to be beaten out of
every country they ever occupied...

1092
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:09,083
how this prison was just
an extension of their system.

1093
01:23:09,167 --> 01:23:11,601
Calling for work
on the threes.

1094
01:23:11,687 --> 01:23:14,724
We had to confront the chief
prison officer, Barker.

1095
01:23:14,807 --> 01:23:16,247
Mr Smalls.

1096
01:23:16,247 --> 01:23:19,247
But to do that,
we had to take care of Ronnie Smalls.

1097
01:23:19,247 --> 01:23:22,239
Can I have a word
about 54 Halsley Road?

1098
01:23:26,007 --> 01:23:27,884
Take a walk.

1099
01:23:35,247 --> 01:23:38,956
If anything happens to me
or Gerry...

1100
01:23:39,727 --> 01:23:42,247
or any other Irish prisoner...

1101
01:23:42,247 --> 01:23:46,604
we'll have 54 Halsley Road
blown to smithereens...

1102
01:23:46,687 --> 01:23:49,565
with your family in it.

1103
01:23:50,887 --> 01:23:53,799
Threaten my family
and I'll cut your fucking head off.

1104
01:23:57,247 --> 01:23:59,158
I don't make threats.

1105
01:23:59,247 --> 01:24:03,240
I just carry out orders.
I don't want to hurt your family.

1106
01:24:08,247 --> 01:24:11,239
Your trouble is,Joe,
you want to rule the fucking world.

1107
01:24:13,727 --> 01:24:15,160
Paddy's all right.

1108
01:24:26,687 --> 01:24:28,245
Soon, we were all
one happy family.

1109
01:24:28,327 --> 01:24:30,079
Again!

1110
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:33,125
Even Kojak was ready to forgive.

1111
01:24:33,207 --> 01:24:36,247
- Live and let live.
- Barker began to panic.

1112
01:24:36,247 --> 01:24:39,159
He told us to take our socks
out of the window.

1113
01:24:39,247 --> 01:24:41,841
He thought we were signalling
to other prisoners.

1114
01:24:41,927 --> 01:24:45,158
We're not signalling.
We're drying our socks out.

1115
01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,646
- Take the socks out of the window.
- Who says?

1116
01:24:46,727 --> 01:24:47,842
Mr Barker.

1117
01:24:47,927 --> 01:24:51,886
- That was all the excuseJoe needed.
- Give us two minutes.

1118
01:24:51,967 --> 01:24:54,276
- Up and away we went.
- Are you with me?

1119
01:24:54,567 --> 01:24:56,000
What's he up to now?

1120
01:24:59,207 --> 01:25:02,597
All prison officers
to vacate the wing.

1121
01:25:02,687 --> 01:25:04,882
All officers
vacate the wing!

1122
01:25:10,767 --> 01:25:12,598
This'll damage the whole campaign.

1123
01:25:12,687 --> 01:25:15,121
Look, you do it your way,
and we'll do it ours, all right?

1124
01:25:15,207 --> 01:25:18,961
- You can read our demands.
- Go back to your cells.

1125
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:20,685
Blankets!

1126
01:25:21,567 --> 01:25:25,037
- For God's sake, put a stop to this.
- You're weakening my position.

1127
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:26,924
- It will end in violence.
- Good.

1128
01:25:27,007 --> 01:25:29,316
- What's good about it?
- It's all they understand.

1129
01:25:32,567 --> 01:25:34,319
Barker refused to negotiate.

1130
01:25:34,607 --> 01:25:36,643
But with the screws gone,
we'd a brief taste of freedom.

1131
01:25:36,727 --> 01:25:38,046
Check out Ronnie!

1132
01:25:40,087 --> 01:25:42,237
Him swallow half Africa.

1133
01:25:43,087 --> 01:25:44,884
I give him about an hour.

1134
01:25:51,247 --> 01:25:54,080
We found out later
our protest got on TV.

1135
01:25:54,167 --> 01:25:56,681
And that's when
the riot squad was ordered in.

1136
01:26:11,687 --> 01:26:14,247
We were singled out
as the ringleaders.

1137
01:26:14,327 --> 01:26:15,555
Now!

1138
01:26:41,247 --> 01:26:43,636
You just signed
your own death warrant, Barker.

1139
01:26:48,127 --> 01:26:49,276
Are you happy now?

1140
01:26:53,687 --> 01:26:56,155
And then you arrived, Gareth.

1141
01:26:56,247 --> 01:27:00,247
That's the first time I saw you,
under a raining shower of sparks.

1142
01:27:00,247 --> 01:27:04,247
It was the first time I'd seen a woman
in five years, other than my mother.

1143
01:27:04,247 --> 01:27:07,603
But to me, you were a lawyer first.
And I hated lawyers.

1144
01:27:07,687 --> 01:27:13,159
- Do you have a new isolation--
- Prisoners: Barth, Andrew.

1145
01:27:13,247 --> 01:27:16,247
Bailey, Benjamin.
McAndrew,Joseph.

1146
01:27:16,247 --> 01:27:19,159
- Sorry. Can you-- I can't hear.
- Conlon, Gerard.

1147
01:27:19,247 --> 01:27:22,205
O'Brien,John.

1148
01:27:22,247 --> 01:27:25,762
Lynch, Bernard.
Crisp, Quincy.

1149
01:27:25,847 --> 01:27:28,236
Lyon, Richard.
Burns, Delrow.

1150
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:32,240
What about Conlon?
Sorry. Giuseppe Conlon.

1151
01:27:32,327 --> 01:27:34,682
He's on the third floor.

1152
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:39,124
He has difficulty
getting down the stairs.

1153
01:27:39,207 --> 01:27:42,247
Well, I'll just have to
go up and see him then.

1154
01:27:42,247 --> 01:27:45,125
- The delegation has seen enough.
- Right-o. Sorry.

1155
01:27:45,207 --> 01:27:48,244
Well, I won't be a minute. I'll just--
Is that all right? Sorry.

1156
01:27:48,327 --> 01:27:51,842
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Sorry.

1157
01:27:57,967 --> 01:27:59,446
Sorry, I can't--

1158
01:27:59,527 --> 01:28:01,563
Pulmonary thrombosis.

1159
01:28:01,647 --> 01:28:04,605
- And he's getting proper medication?
- Aye.

1160
01:28:09,287 --> 01:28:10,561
Son?

1161
01:28:13,327 --> 01:28:15,318
That's-- Is it Gerry?

1162
01:28:15,407 --> 01:28:16,806
That's Gerry.

1163
01:28:16,887 --> 01:28:19,606
He's had a spot of bother
with lawyers in the past.

1164
01:28:23,447 --> 01:28:26,359
He's all yours.
Fifteen minutes.

1165
01:28:26,447 --> 01:28:28,244
- Thank you.
- Sit down.

1166
01:28:35,247 --> 01:28:37,238
You wanted to see me, Gerry?

1167
01:28:57,967 --> 01:29:00,640
Why are you giving
my father false hope?

1168
01:29:00,727 --> 01:29:02,399
Sorry?

1169
01:29:02,487 --> 01:29:05,445
He's been up and down
these stairs to see you.

1170
01:29:05,527 --> 01:29:07,643
He hasn't even seen
my mother in six months.

1171
01:29:07,727 --> 01:29:10,560
I hear you're getting on
very well with her, by the way.

1172
01:29:10,647 --> 01:29:12,877
Yes. She's a very brave woman.

1173
01:29:12,967 --> 01:29:14,878
You don't know the half of it.

1174
01:29:17,407 --> 01:29:19,318
The fucking stairs are killing him.

1175
01:29:19,407 --> 01:29:22,247
It's not the stairs that
are killing your father.

1176
01:29:22,247 --> 01:29:25,683
- What is it, then?
- It's your lack of faith.

1177
01:29:25,767 --> 01:29:28,486
Lack of faith?
Faith in what?

1178
01:29:28,567 --> 01:29:30,285
In yourself.

1179
01:29:30,367 --> 01:29:32,961
No, I have faith in myself.

1180
01:29:34,407 --> 01:29:38,036
Gerry Conlon, lifer,
30-year sentence.

1181
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:40,317
And I know how to survive it.

1182
01:29:41,807 --> 01:29:43,240
At what price?

1183
01:29:43,327 --> 01:29:45,682
I'll pay the fucking price.
Don't you worry about it.

1184
01:29:45,767 --> 01:29:48,486
The price for what?

1185
01:29:50,247 --> 01:29:53,762
You're very good at the English,
aren't you?

1186
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:56,566
You see, I don't understand
your language.

1187
01:29:58,567 --> 01:30:02,247
"Justice.'' "Mercy.'' "Clemency.''

1188
01:30:02,247 --> 01:30:05,876
I literally don't understand
what those words mean.

1189
01:30:05,967 --> 01:30:09,004
I'd like to put in an application
to get all my teeth extracted.

1190
01:30:09,247 --> 01:30:13,286
That way I could put my fist in my mouth
and never speak another word of English.

1191
01:30:13,367 --> 01:30:15,927
Do you see what I'm saying?
Mrs Peirce, is it?

1192
01:30:16,007 --> 01:30:18,646
Are you trying to impress me?

1193
01:30:20,487 --> 01:30:21,886
Visit's up.

1194
01:30:21,967 --> 01:30:24,925
Don't give my father
false hope, all right?

1195
01:30:28,367 --> 01:30:30,437
You've got to help him!

1196
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:35,844
In prison, you pray for anything
to break the monotony.

1197
01:30:35,927 --> 01:30:38,805
A snowstorm is like
a present from God.

1198
01:30:49,247 --> 01:30:51,044
Prison officers are not to be hit!

1199
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:53,639
You've asked for it.

1200
01:30:53,727 --> 01:30:55,524
Come along!

1201
01:30:55,607 --> 01:30:59,236
After the riot, my father's
health deteriorated badly.

1202
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:02,723
He couldn't make it down
the stairs to enjoy the snow.

1203
01:31:02,807 --> 01:31:06,436
I waved up to him, but he
was looking at something else.

1204
01:31:15,967 --> 01:31:18,925
My da always saw the good
in people.

1205
01:31:19,007 --> 01:31:22,556
He recognized it in you
the minute he saw you, Gareth.

1206
01:31:22,647 --> 01:31:26,959
Guv, guv, where you going?
Where's me letters? Guv'nor!

1207
01:31:30,407 --> 01:31:31,999
Thank you.

1208
01:31:36,527 --> 01:31:39,246
I see you've been mentioned
in Congress, Giuseppe.

1209
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:40,760
What's that?

1210
01:31:47,007 --> 01:31:48,918
How'd you come by that name?

1211
01:31:50,847 --> 01:31:52,644
An Italian ice cream maker.

1212
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:55,844
Had a shop on the corner
of the street where I was born.

1213
01:31:55,927 --> 01:31:58,043
Giuseppe Fusco.

1214
01:31:58,247 --> 01:32:00,681
My mother fell in love
with the name.

1215
01:32:00,767 --> 01:32:02,246
Were they--

1216
01:32:03,807 --> 01:32:05,320
- You know.
- What?

1217
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:08,444
- Lovers.
- Who?

1218
01:32:08,527 --> 01:32:10,324
My mother and the ice cream maker?

1219
01:32:11,367 --> 01:32:12,959
Oh, no, God.

1220
01:32:13,047 --> 01:32:15,242
Jesus, no.
No, they were not.

1221
01:32:17,287 --> 01:32:19,323
No, she just liked the name.

1222
01:32:19,407 --> 01:32:22,604
But it made my life hell.

1223
01:32:22,687 --> 01:32:26,726
All the other children laughing at you.
You have any kids yourself?

1224
01:32:31,287 --> 01:32:32,561
He's talking to Barker.

1225
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:36,037
Forget it. He can talk
to whoever he fucking likes.

1226
01:32:38,807 --> 01:32:40,286
Two.

1227
01:32:41,687 --> 01:32:43,882
Flown the nest now.

1228
01:33:00,607 --> 01:33:02,563
Whether Barker was
responsible or not...

1229
01:33:02,647 --> 01:33:05,764
for bringing in the riot squad,
Joe never forgave him.

1230
01:33:07,367 --> 01:33:09,403
Joe was still at war...

1231
01:33:09,487 --> 01:33:11,921
and to him,
Barker was the enemy.

1232
01:33:13,887 --> 01:33:15,366
Number?

1233
01:33:15,447 --> 01:33:17,244
The name is McAndrew.

1234
01:33:19,247 --> 01:33:21,363
Get out.
Get out of the light!

1235
01:33:23,247 --> 01:33:24,805
- Get out of the light.
- Number?

1236
01:33:24,887 --> 01:33:26,605
Name's Gerry Conlon.

1237
01:33:28,327 --> 01:33:30,887
Piss off out of the light.
Get out of the light!

1238
01:33:30,967 --> 01:33:32,798
You're 1 36.

1239
01:33:38,407 --> 01:33:39,999
There's someone sitting there.

1240
01:33:42,927 --> 01:33:44,679
Move when you're told.

1241
01:33:51,327 --> 01:33:52,840
Put it out.

1242
01:34:22,767 --> 01:34:25,361
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1243
01:34:25,447 --> 01:34:28,325
You know, he looks
more like you every day.

1244
01:34:28,407 --> 01:34:31,046
He's smarter than I am.

1245
01:34:31,247 --> 01:34:33,247
Three years old,
he can read the funny papers.

1246
01:34:33,247 --> 01:34:35,247
There's a hair
in the fucking projector!

1247
01:34:35,247 --> 01:34:38,557
Yeah, get the fucking hair
out the projector, will you?

1248
01:34:39,727 --> 01:34:42,639
- Come on. Get it out!
- Get it out!

1249
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:46,684
We're going fucking blind up here.

1250
01:34:46,767 --> 01:34:48,246
Lively.

1251
01:34:54,687 --> 01:34:56,359
- We'll get there, Pop.
- Quiet.

1252
01:34:56,447 --> 01:34:58,324
- I didn't say a fucking thing.
- You're blocking.

1253
01:34:58,407 --> 01:35:00,637
Shut it.

1254
01:35:02,407 --> 01:35:04,796
Now, listen.
Whoever comes to you...

1255
01:35:04,887 --> 01:35:06,479
with this Barzini meeting--

1256
01:35:12,007 --> 01:35:16,603
I knew that Santino was gonna
have to go through all this.

1257
01:35:16,687 --> 01:35:18,484
And Fredo, well--

1258
01:35:20,247 --> 01:35:21,965
Fredo was wrong.

1259
01:35:24,407 --> 01:35:27,319
And I never wanted this for you.

1260
01:35:30,727 --> 01:35:31,398
For you!

1261
01:35:45,327 --> 01:35:47,363
To the floor, mate! Get down!

1262
01:35:54,527 --> 01:35:58,361
Come on, mate, get a blanket!
For God's sake, he's burning!

1263
01:35:59,247 --> 01:36:01,761
Barker! Move back, Barker!

1264
01:36:01,847 --> 01:36:03,405
Get in there!

1265
01:36:04,847 --> 01:36:06,838
Get it out!

1266
01:36:28,367 --> 01:36:31,040
- Stretcher!
- Let's check it out.

1267
01:36:31,247 --> 01:36:33,044
All right, mate.
You're with us.

1268
01:36:33,247 --> 01:36:34,726
All right. Stretcher!

1269
01:36:36,327 --> 01:36:37,646
Gently.

1270
01:36:37,727 --> 01:36:39,240
All right, up!

1271
01:36:40,407 --> 01:36:43,319
That was a good day's work,
McAndrew.

1272
01:36:43,407 --> 01:36:44,886
That was a good day's work.

1273
01:36:44,967 --> 01:36:47,401
Get away from me.

1274
01:36:47,487 --> 01:36:49,842
Will you not look me in the eye
when I'm speaking to you?

1275
01:36:52,487 --> 01:36:56,241
I know how to look at people
without blinking as well.

1276
01:36:59,767 --> 01:37:02,281
In all my godforsaken life,
I've never known...

1277
01:37:02,367 --> 01:37:05,598
what it was like to want
to kill somebody until now.

1278
01:37:08,007 --> 01:37:10,999
You're a brave man,Joe,
a brave man.

1279
01:37:13,847 --> 01:37:16,247
Gerard Conlon, back on the threes.

1280
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:19,796
- Stand your ground.
- Hawkins, returning to his cell.

1281
01:37:19,887 --> 01:37:22,685
Benjamin Bailey, back to him cell!

1282
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,837
Burns, returning to his cell.

1283
01:37:24,927 --> 01:37:27,839
7 445, Casey, back to his cell.

1284
01:37:27,927 --> 01:37:30,487
6309,Johnston, level three.

1285
01:37:30,567 --> 01:37:33,365
Regis, 1 1 3,
going up to number two.

1286
01:37:50,887 --> 01:37:53,481
- Back to your cell now!
- Keep moving.

1287
01:37:54,487 --> 01:37:56,398
Barker was maimed for life...

1288
01:37:56,487 --> 01:37:58,955
and Joe was sent
to another prison.

1289
01:37:59,047 --> 01:38:00,958
He's in solitary confinement
somewhere.

1290
01:38:01,047 --> 01:38:03,561
We've had no news of him
since then.

1291
01:38:03,647 --> 01:38:05,877
The new chief screw
had the yard painted...

1292
01:38:05,967 --> 01:38:07,878
and I was back
walking in circles again.

1293
01:38:07,967 --> 01:38:09,639
Back to the cells.

1294
01:38:12,327 --> 01:38:14,636
Come on. Move.

1295
01:38:42,247 --> 01:38:45,239
I'd like to help you out
with the campaign, Da...

1296
01:38:46,447 --> 01:38:49,359
if that's all right with you.

1297
01:38:49,447 --> 01:38:51,039
Do you mean it?

1298
01:38:51,247 --> 01:38:52,680
Aye.

1299
01:38:53,607 --> 01:38:55,438
That's great.

1300
01:38:55,527 --> 01:38:58,997
What I need from you is
the whole story, your whole story...

1301
01:38:59,247 --> 01:39:01,715
in as much detail
as you can remember.

1302
01:39:01,807 --> 01:39:05,402
And I need you to write it down.
It's really important.

1303
01:39:11,767 --> 01:39:13,564
I can't do this.

1304
01:39:15,447 --> 01:39:17,483
I can't write this, Da.

1305
01:39:17,567 --> 01:39:19,956
Could your son
not give you a hand?

1306
01:39:20,047 --> 01:39:22,766
He's up in his cell writing away.

1307
01:39:34,727 --> 01:39:36,638
Tape recorder.

1308
01:39:36,727 --> 01:39:38,604
You're a good talker.

1309
01:39:38,687 --> 01:39:40,245
Talk.

1310
01:39:41,847 --> 01:39:43,803
The strange thing is--

1311
01:39:44,887 --> 01:39:47,247
the strange thing is sometimes
I think he's a littlejealous...

1312
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,841
of me taking over the campaign
and that there.

1313
01:39:49,927 --> 01:39:53,044
Going up and down the stairs
to meet you.

1314
01:39:53,247 --> 01:39:55,317
That's something
I never thought about Giuseppe.:

1315
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:57,238
that he could bejealous.

1316
01:40:00,247 --> 01:40:04,247
Anyhow, the main thing is
to get the case reopened...

1317
01:40:04,247 --> 01:40:07,922
because I don't know how long
he can survive in here.

1318
01:40:24,727 --> 01:40:28,686
- I'm tired of this.
- Come on. We have to do this.

1319
01:40:28,767 --> 01:40:30,280
You behave yourself.

1320
01:40:33,927 --> 01:40:35,724
Get your head down.

1321
01:40:43,007 --> 01:40:46,238
When I was a wee lad, I used to wonder
what you were doing under the towel.

1322
01:40:46,327 --> 01:40:49,763
One day when you and Ma were out,
I got a big bowl of boiling water...

1323
01:40:49,847 --> 01:40:53,247
whacked a big drop of Vick
and put the towel over my head.

1324
01:40:53,247 --> 01:40:56,922
I sat there trying to figure out what it
was about 'cause nothing was happening.

1325
01:40:57,007 --> 01:40:58,918
I figured you
must've been drinking it.

1326
01:40:59,007 --> 01:41:00,918
So I stuck my tongue in it.
Do you remember that?

1327
01:41:04,647 --> 01:41:06,603
How could I forget?

1328
01:41:07,447 --> 01:41:10,325
And your tongue
swelled up like a football.

1329
01:41:11,407 --> 01:41:13,523
Had to rush you to the hospital.

1330
01:41:13,607 --> 01:41:15,757
First time you'd stopped
talking in your life.

1331
01:41:19,367 --> 01:41:20,800
Give us that.

1332
01:41:21,927 --> 01:41:24,395
I'll do your chest for you, Da.

1333
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:33,563
Was I always bad, was I?

1334
01:41:34,847 --> 01:41:36,280
Not always.

1335
01:41:36,367 --> 01:41:39,245
I don't deserve to spend
the rest of my life in here, do I?

1336
01:41:40,247 --> 01:41:42,715
All they've done
is block out the light.

1337
01:41:42,807 --> 01:41:44,718
They can't block out
the light in here.

1338
01:41:44,807 --> 01:41:46,604
Listen.

1339
01:41:46,687 --> 01:41:48,325
Every night...

1340
01:41:48,407 --> 01:41:50,841
I take your mother's
hand in mine.

1341
01:41:50,927 --> 01:41:55,000
We go out the front door,
into Cyprus Street...

1342
01:41:55,247 --> 01:41:58,398
down to Falls Road,
up the Antrim Road...

1343
01:41:59,887 --> 01:42:01,878
to Cave Hill.

1344
01:42:01,967 --> 01:42:03,605
We look back down...

1345
01:42:06,007 --> 01:42:08,043
on poor, troubled Belfast.

1346
01:42:11,447 --> 01:42:14,247
I've been doing that every night...

1347
01:42:14,247 --> 01:42:16,044
for five years now.

1348
01:42:18,247 --> 01:42:20,317
As if I never left your mother.

1349
01:42:30,247 --> 01:42:32,807
What I remember most
about my childhood is...

1350
01:42:32,887 --> 01:42:34,878
holding your hand.

1351
01:42:34,967 --> 01:42:37,527
My wee hand in your big hand.

1352
01:42:37,607 --> 01:42:40,247
And the smell of tobacco.
I remember that...

1353
01:42:40,247 --> 01:42:43,444
I could smell the tobacco
off the palm of your hand.

1354
01:42:46,847 --> 01:42:50,681
When I want to feel happy, I try
to remember the smell of tobacco.

1355
01:42:54,407 --> 01:42:55,999
Hold my hand.

1356
01:42:56,247 --> 01:42:58,044
Get the fuck--

1357
01:42:59,247 --> 01:43:01,317
Don't go sentimental on me now.

1358
01:43:02,727 --> 01:43:06,481
Don't be upset, Da. Look,
I'll hold your hand if you like.

1359
01:43:09,047 --> 01:43:10,799
I'm going to die.

1360
01:43:12,047 --> 01:43:13,958
Don't be saying that.

1361
01:43:14,887 --> 01:43:16,320
I'm scared.

1362
01:43:18,487 --> 01:43:20,478
You've no reason to be scared.

1363
01:43:20,567 --> 01:43:25,243
Don't you be comforting me when I can
see the truth staring me in the face.

1364
01:43:25,327 --> 01:43:29,002
I'm scared I'm gonna die here
among strangers.

1365
01:43:29,247 --> 01:43:30,566
You're not fucking dying.

1366
01:43:30,647 --> 01:43:34,322
Can I not say a thing
without you fucking contradicting me?

1367
01:43:35,727 --> 01:43:40,881
I'm scared to leave
your mother behind.

1368
01:43:42,887 --> 01:43:46,243
Look, you are not going to die,
all right, Da?

1369
01:43:48,447 --> 01:43:52,042
Even if you do, sure I can
look after Ma all right.

1370
01:43:52,247 --> 01:43:55,319
You think I'd leave
Sarah in your care?

1371
01:43:56,847 --> 01:43:58,519
What do you mean?

1372
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:02,566
You haven't the maturity to take care
of yourself, let alone your mother.

1373
01:44:09,607 --> 01:44:12,247
I haven't much time between
appointments, Mrs Peirce.

1374
01:44:12,247 --> 01:44:14,442
- How can I help you?
- Thank you.

1375
01:44:14,527 --> 01:44:18,247
I'm the solicitor for the Conlons,
Chief Inspector.

1376
01:44:18,247 --> 01:44:22,001
Giuseppe Conlon is critically ill,
as you may know.

1377
01:44:22,247 --> 01:44:24,477
I've petitioned before the court
for his compassionate parole.

1378
01:44:24,567 --> 01:44:26,239
They want your clearance.

1379
01:44:27,327 --> 01:44:29,247
That'll be difficult, Mrs Peirce.

1380
01:44:29,247 --> 01:44:32,637
These people have committed
horrific crimes.

1381
01:44:32,727 --> 01:44:35,036
Society demands
that they serve their time.

1382
01:44:36,247 --> 01:44:38,556
But they didn't do it,
Chief Inspector.

1383
01:44:38,647 --> 01:44:40,247
Says who?

1384
01:44:40,247 --> 01:44:42,556
Say the real bombers.

1385
01:44:42,647 --> 01:44:45,286
They told you they did it,
Mr Dixon.

1386
01:44:45,367 --> 01:44:47,927
Gerry Conlon told me he did it,
Mrs Peirce.

1387
01:44:48,007 --> 01:44:50,601
These people are liars.

1388
01:44:50,687 --> 01:44:53,247
They're liars for a cause.
That's the worst kind.

1389
01:44:53,287 --> 01:44:55,517
But he's dying.
Giuseppe's dying.

1390
01:44:55,607 --> 01:44:58,644
A lot of people are dying.
It's a dirty war.

1391
01:45:03,247 --> 01:45:05,247
Well, I'll see what I can do.

1392
01:45:05,247 --> 01:45:07,283
Is this your family, Mr Dixon?

1393
01:45:08,487 --> 01:45:10,443
That's my wife and my son.

1394
01:45:10,527 --> 01:45:12,961
You have another appointment.

1395
01:45:13,047 --> 01:45:14,366
Yes.

1396
01:45:15,727 --> 01:45:18,799
I'll see you again, Mr Dixon.

1397
01:45:54,807 --> 01:45:56,684
Are you all right, Da?

1398
01:46:10,287 --> 01:46:12,482
Are you all right?

1399
01:46:15,287 --> 01:46:16,720
Wake up, Da.

1400
01:46:17,767 --> 01:46:21,043
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Giuseppe?

1401
01:46:22,247 --> 01:46:24,044
Come on, dear God in heaven,
don't do this to me.

1402
01:46:24,247 --> 01:46:25,521
Come on. Wake up.

1403
01:46:25,607 --> 01:46:27,837
Wake up! Fuck's sake, come on!

1404
01:46:27,927 --> 01:46:31,476
There you go. Thank you.
You're all right, Da.

1405
01:46:31,567 --> 01:46:33,523
I'm going to get some help.

1406
01:46:33,607 --> 01:46:36,247
Number 73! Number 73!

1407
01:46:36,247 --> 01:46:38,807
Please come quickly!
My father's sick!

1408
01:46:38,887 --> 01:46:40,479
Benbay, Giuseppe's taken bad!

1409
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:42,247
Put your arms around me.

1410
01:46:42,247 --> 01:46:45,364
I'm getting you out of bed.
Put your arms around me.

1411
01:46:48,247 --> 01:46:50,886
- Open the fucking door!
- He's number 73!

1412
01:46:50,967 --> 01:46:52,719
- Open the fucking door!
- Giuseppe!

1413
01:46:53,927 --> 01:46:56,600
Fuck, he can't breathe.
He can't fucking breathe!

1414
01:46:57,447 --> 01:47:00,917
He can't breathe!
Look, my father's fucking dying!

1415
01:47:01,007 --> 01:47:03,999
- He needs oxygen!
- Give him a fucking break!

1416
01:47:04,247 --> 01:47:06,966
Open the fucking gate!
I'm right here, Da.

1417
01:47:07,047 --> 01:47:08,958
Get him in here!

1418
01:47:09,047 --> 01:47:11,436
What the fuck is going on?

1419
01:47:15,847 --> 01:47:17,439
Hammersmith Hospital now.

1420
01:47:17,527 --> 01:47:19,279
I want to go with him.

1421
01:47:20,527 --> 01:47:23,644
I've got to get clearance first.
It's out of my hands.

1422
01:47:23,727 --> 01:47:25,922
You're gonna be all right, Da!

1423
01:47:26,007 --> 01:47:29,238
- I'll be with you as soon as I can.
- Take him back to his cell.

1424
01:47:34,807 --> 01:47:39,247
Leave him alone, you bastards!
Just let him be!

1425
01:47:39,247 --> 01:47:42,247
Stay strong, Gerry!
Stay strong, mate!

1426
01:47:42,247 --> 01:47:44,247
Keep your chin up, mate!

1427
01:47:44,247 --> 01:47:45,965
We're with you, Gerry!

1428
01:47:46,047 --> 01:47:48,242
We're with you all the way, mate!

1429
01:48:01,327 --> 01:48:02,919
He's still awake.

1430
01:48:17,847 --> 01:48:20,236
Your father passed away
an hour ago.

1431
01:48:21,327 --> 01:48:22,919
Thank you very much.

1432
01:48:25,447 --> 01:48:27,244
I'm sorry.

1433
01:48:58,687 --> 01:49:00,678
Giuseppe is dead, man!

1434
01:49:01,647 --> 01:49:03,717
They kill Giuseppe!

1435
01:49:09,487 --> 01:49:10,920
Gerry, man!

1436
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:17,764
They killed Giuseppe!

1437
01:50:06,367 --> 01:50:09,245
Well, I think they ought to take
the word " compassion''...

1438
01:50:09,287 --> 01:50:11,243
out of the English dictionary.

1439
01:50:14,327 --> 01:50:16,397
They fouled the ball, Gareth.

1440
01:50:19,367 --> 01:50:23,042
They fouled the fucking ball,
and they're as guilty as sin.

1441
01:50:24,247 --> 01:50:27,239
Believe me, if there's one thing
I know about, it's guilt.

1442
01:50:28,607 --> 01:50:32,282
Keep looking 'em in the eye,
and it's gonna reveal itself.

1443
01:50:32,367 --> 01:50:34,437
You have to keep up the pressure.

1444
01:50:37,487 --> 01:50:39,443
Do what you have to do.

1445
01:50:41,527 --> 01:50:44,246
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1446
01:51:03,367 --> 01:51:06,040
Those were meant to be here
three weeks ago.

1447
01:51:09,247 --> 01:51:12,683
"The Parade of Innocence.''
What do you think?

1448
01:51:12,767 --> 01:51:15,247
Thousands of people
lined the streets of Dublin...

1449
01:51:15,247 --> 01:51:16,839
London and Liverpool today
in demonstrations...

1450
01:51:16,927 --> 01:51:18,963
demanding the release
of the Guildford Four.

1451
01:51:19,047 --> 01:51:22,247
- Questions have been raised--
- Say good night to Daddy.

1452
01:51:22,247 --> 01:51:24,681
- Good night, Dad.
- Good night, son.

1453
01:51:24,767 --> 01:51:26,598
Free the Four!
Free the Four!

1454
01:51:39,567 --> 01:51:41,603
This was a mistake.

1455
01:51:42,567 --> 01:51:44,842
Why don't we let her
see the files?

1456
01:51:44,927 --> 01:51:47,236
What harm could it do?

1457
01:51:47,287 --> 01:51:49,881
- Mr Dixon!
- Yes?

1458
01:51:49,967 --> 01:51:51,878
Don't you get tired of this?

1459
01:51:51,967 --> 01:51:54,720
This is a court order that I be allowed
to see the Giuseppe Conlon case files.

1460
01:51:58,567 --> 01:52:01,320
- Good morning.
- There are a few rules to be observed.

1461
01:52:03,047 --> 01:52:05,356
Here's a complete list of
the Conlon, Giuseppe case files...

1462
01:52:05,447 --> 01:52:07,358
the only files you'll need to see.

1463
01:52:07,447 --> 01:52:09,677
I'll go to the file drawer
and bring it out.

1464
01:52:09,767 --> 01:52:12,486
You take a page at a time,
read it and then return it.

1465
01:52:12,567 --> 01:52:15,365
Sorry. Is there a problem,
Mr Dixon?

1466
01:52:15,447 --> 01:52:17,324
Problem?
Not at all, Mrs Peirce.

1467
01:52:17,407 --> 01:52:20,877
Our chief archivist, Mr Jenkins,
is here to assist you.

1468
01:52:21,887 --> 01:52:24,321
If you want to make a photocopy,
I alone will do it.

1469
01:52:24,407 --> 01:52:27,240
Use this pen at all times
for any notes.

1470
01:52:27,327 --> 01:52:30,876
If you deface any document, we can
trace it through the ink in this pen.

1471
01:52:30,967 --> 01:52:35,563
There are national security issues
involved here, Mrs Peirce.

1472
01:52:35,647 --> 01:52:37,603
We wouldn't want
police intelligence files...

1473
01:52:37,687 --> 01:52:40,918
leaked to the IRA now, would we?

1474
01:52:43,567 --> 01:52:45,364
Conlon, Giuseppe file.

1475
01:52:45,447 --> 01:52:47,358
Yes, sir.

1476
01:53:00,247 --> 01:53:02,715
Leave my kit on the bus,
'cause I'm not staying in your jail.

1477
01:53:02,807 --> 01:53:06,482
So, our new VIP prisoner.

1478
01:53:06,567 --> 01:53:07,966
Welcome to Scotland.

1479
01:53:08,047 --> 01:53:10,242
I'm an innocent man.
My father was an innocent man.

1480
01:53:10,287 --> 01:53:14,439
He died in one of your jails.
There's nothing you can do to hurt me.

1481
01:53:14,527 --> 01:53:16,438
They've moved me to a Scottish
jail to break my confidence.

1482
01:53:16,527 --> 01:53:19,917
- Put him in solitary.
- This is a peaceful protest.

1483
01:53:20,007 --> 01:53:21,565
We'll teach you manners.

1484
01:53:21,647 --> 01:53:23,399
Better men than you
have tried that already.

1485
01:53:23,487 --> 01:53:26,001
I have not seen my client
for two months.

1486
01:53:26,247 --> 01:53:29,717
He's been moved to Scotland, which has
impeded my investigation into his case.

1487
01:53:29,807 --> 01:53:33,482
So I'm filing this motion
to gain proper access--

1488
01:53:33,567 --> 01:53:35,239
Free the Four!

1489
01:53:51,047 --> 01:53:52,765
Here, thanks a lot.
Good day.

1490
01:53:52,847 --> 01:53:54,485
Thanks, thanks, thanks.

1491
01:54:12,247 --> 01:54:15,478
Sorry. Could you copy that
for me, please?

1492
01:54:16,447 --> 01:54:18,597
Thank you.

1493
01:54:28,047 --> 01:54:31,005
I just want my mother to be happy.

1494
01:54:32,407 --> 01:54:35,558
I'd like her to know...

1495
01:54:35,647 --> 01:54:39,322
that Giuseppe talked about her
every day of his life.

1496
01:54:41,807 --> 01:54:43,763
He missed her terribly.

1497
01:54:48,687 --> 01:54:51,599
It's strange to be in a cell
without him.

1498
01:54:54,247 --> 01:54:56,841
I can't seem to get his face
out of my mind.

1499
01:54:56,927 --> 01:54:58,838
Everywhere I look, I see him.

1500
01:55:06,247 --> 01:55:10,365
Strange what time does
when you're in prison.

1501
01:55:12,607 --> 01:55:16,441
Like, you can be staring
at the wall.

1502
01:55:16,527 --> 01:55:18,961
Drip, drip, drip.

1503
01:55:21,287 --> 01:55:22,686
It takes an eternity.

1504
01:55:22,767 --> 01:55:26,043
And then you blink,
and three years have gone by.

1505
01:55:31,047 --> 01:55:33,247
I mean, what I'm trying to--

1506
01:55:33,247 --> 01:55:36,284
I don't know what the fuck
I'm trying to say.

1507
01:55:38,687 --> 01:55:41,645
But I can't forget
what they did to my family.

1508
01:55:43,407 --> 01:55:44,920
I just can't forget.

1509
01:56:33,967 --> 01:56:35,320
Morning.

1510
01:56:36,607 --> 01:56:39,246
- Where's Jenkins?
- He telephoned in sick.

1511
01:56:39,287 --> 01:56:41,596
I'm afraid you're going
to have to come back tomorrow.

1512
01:56:41,687 --> 01:56:44,440
I can't. I'm in court tomorrow.
There's too much to get through.

1513
01:56:44,527 --> 01:56:46,006
I can't help you.

1514
01:56:46,247 --> 01:56:47,999
Please. I've got the court order.

1515
01:56:48,247 --> 01:56:50,477
You saw what Mr Jenkins did.
He just brings me the files.

1516
01:56:50,567 --> 01:56:53,035
I take the notes and give them
back to you. Please.

1517
01:56:53,247 --> 01:56:55,841
- What name is it?
- Conlon.

1518
01:56:55,927 --> 01:56:58,964
- All right.
- Thanks. Thank you very much. Cheers.

1519
01:57:04,887 --> 01:57:06,605
What name was that again?

1520
01:57:08,287 --> 01:57:10,437
We've got two Conlon boxes.

1521
01:57:10,527 --> 01:57:14,281
Is it Giuseppe Conlon
or Gerard Conlon?

1522
01:57:16,327 --> 01:57:17,760
Gerard.

1523
01:57:25,247 --> 01:57:27,238
Well, that's for starters.

1524
01:57:49,247 --> 01:57:50,521
Fuck 'em!

1525
01:57:53,287 --> 01:57:54,720
It's good news.

1526
01:57:55,887 --> 01:57:59,243
We're talking about
a piece of evidence...

1527
01:57:59,327 --> 01:58:02,717
that says they knew all along,
that they let my father die in prison?

1528
01:58:02,807 --> 01:58:05,765
Would you mind telling me
what's good about that?

1529
01:58:05,847 --> 01:58:07,758
We'll get them in court.

1530
01:58:07,847 --> 01:58:10,680
"We'll get them in court''?
Will you catch yourself on?

1531
01:58:10,767 --> 01:58:13,839
They've kept us in prison for 1 5 years.
They can keep us in for another 1 5.

1532
01:58:13,927 --> 01:58:15,838
This is the fucking
government, Gareth!

1533
01:58:15,927 --> 01:58:18,964
It's the fucking government!
What are they gonna say?

1534
01:58:19,047 --> 01:58:21,242
"We're sorry about that''?

1535
01:58:22,407 --> 01:58:25,365
"Made a wee bit of a mistake,
but you can be on your way now''?

1536
01:58:25,447 --> 01:58:27,597
What are they gonna say?
"Sorry we killed your da''?

1537
01:58:27,687 --> 01:58:30,599
"Sorry we fucked
your fucking life to hell''?

1538
01:58:48,047 --> 01:58:51,005
I am not putting my mother
through hell again.

1539
01:58:52,047 --> 01:58:53,799
Are you afraid of court?

1540
01:58:53,887 --> 01:58:56,242
I just don't wanna be
humiliated again.

1541
01:59:17,367 --> 01:59:18,925
I swear by Almighty God...

1542
01:59:19,007 --> 01:59:22,397
that the evidence I shall give
shall be the truth, the whole truth...

1543
01:59:22,487 --> 01:59:24,443
and nothing but the truth.

1544
01:59:31,487 --> 01:59:35,844
Mr Dixon, do you know
these young people...

1545
01:59:35,927 --> 01:59:38,282
known as the Guildford Four?

1546
01:59:40,927 --> 01:59:42,326
Yes, I do.

1547
01:59:42,407 --> 01:59:45,524
Do you know how long
they have spent in jail?

1548
01:59:46,567 --> 01:59:47,966
Fifteen years.

1549
01:59:50,727 --> 01:59:52,479
Do you know Annie Maguire...

1550
01:59:53,447 --> 01:59:56,644
who served her 1 4 years
without remission?

1551
01:59:57,687 --> 02:00:00,520
Do you know her son Vincent
who served five years?

1552
02:00:00,607 --> 02:00:03,360
Her son Patrick who served four?
Do you know her husband...

1553
02:00:03,447 --> 02:00:06,405
Paddy Maguire, who served 1 2 years?

1554
02:00:07,487 --> 02:00:11,400
Carole Richardson was 1 7
when she went to jail, Mr Dixon.

1555
02:00:11,487 --> 02:00:13,318
Now she is 32.

1556
02:00:15,247 --> 02:00:17,247
Do you know Carole Richardson?

1557
02:00:17,247 --> 02:00:21,525
- What is the point of this?
- Yes, come to the point.

1558
02:00:27,807 --> 02:00:31,243
Do you know who this is, Mr Dixon?

1559
02:00:35,047 --> 02:00:36,844
No, I don't.

1560
02:00:36,927 --> 02:00:38,724
Well, then would you be so kind...

1561
02:00:38,807 --> 02:00:42,247
as to read this statement
that you took from him...

1562
02:00:42,247 --> 02:00:45,239
on the third of November, 1 9 7 4?

1563
02:00:45,327 --> 02:00:49,036
A statement, My Lord, which
vindicates all of these people...

1564
02:00:49,247 --> 02:00:52,045
-all these innocent people.
-I need to see a copy of this statement.

1565
02:00:52,247 --> 02:00:55,683
Either that man or his superior
or his superior's superior...

1566
02:00:55,767 --> 02:00:58,839
ordered that these people
be used as scapegoats...

1567
02:00:58,927 --> 02:01:02,044
by a nation
that was baying for blood...

1568
02:01:02,247 --> 02:01:05,000
in return for the innocent blood
spilled on the streets of Guildford!

1569
02:01:05,247 --> 02:01:08,247
- You got your blood, Mr Dixon!
- She is making a political speech.

1570
02:01:08,247 --> 02:01:11,796
You got the blood of Giuseppe Conlon
and the lifeblood of Carole Richardson!

1571
02:01:11,887 --> 02:01:15,004
You got 1 5 years of blood and sweat
and pain from my client...

1572
02:01:15,247 --> 02:01:17,920
whose only crime
was that he was Irish...

1573
02:01:18,007 --> 02:01:20,646
and foolish, and he was in
the wrong place at the wrong time!

1574
02:01:20,727 --> 02:01:23,764
Mrs Peirce, I will have you
removed from the court.

1575
02:01:29,847 --> 02:01:32,441
And one of your colleagues,
My Lord...

1576
02:01:32,527 --> 02:01:35,599
who sat where you sit now said,
"It is a pity...

1577
02:01:35,687 --> 02:01:38,247
you were not charged
with treason to the Crown--

1578
02:01:38,247 --> 02:01:41,956
a charge that carries a penalty
of death by hanging--

1579
02:01:42,047 --> 02:01:45,278
a sentence I would have no difficulty
in passing in this case.''

1580
02:01:45,367 --> 02:01:48,279
Mrs Peirce, I am trying
to read this document.

1581
02:01:48,367 --> 02:01:51,598
I will not tell you again
to be silent...

1582
02:01:51,687 --> 02:01:55,236
or you will be removed
from the court.

1583
02:02:37,247 --> 02:02:39,477
My Lord, this document...

1584
02:02:39,567 --> 02:02:42,718
brings the entire British
legal system into disrepute.

1585
02:02:42,807 --> 02:02:45,367
My Lord, this is new evidence.

1586
02:02:45,447 --> 02:02:47,483
It is shocking new evidence.

1587
02:02:47,567 --> 02:02:49,247
My Lord, this evidence...

1588
02:02:49,247 --> 02:02:52,444
was not submitted at the trial
that is under appeal.

1589
02:02:52,527 --> 02:02:56,236
That, I believe, is the point
Mrs Peirce is trying to make.

1590
02:02:56,287 --> 02:02:58,960
- Proceed, Mrs Peirce.
- My Lord, I demand a recess.

1591
02:02:59,047 --> 02:03:03,040
There will be no demands made
in my court.

1592
02:03:03,247 --> 02:03:04,566
Stand back.

1593
02:03:09,247 --> 02:03:11,807
This alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1594
02:03:11,887 --> 02:03:13,639
was taken by Mr Dixon...

1595
02:03:13,727 --> 02:03:16,958
one month after
Gerry Conlon was arrested.

1596
02:03:17,047 --> 02:03:21,247
This note was attached to it
when I found it in police files.

1597
02:03:21,247 --> 02:03:24,603
It reads, "Not to be shown
to the defence.''

1598
02:03:30,567 --> 02:03:33,639
I have one question
to ask you, Mr Dixon:

1599
02:03:33,727 --> 02:03:35,877
Why was the alibi for Gerry Conlon...

1600
02:03:35,967 --> 02:03:40,245
who was charged with the murder
of five innocent people...

1601
02:03:40,327 --> 02:03:42,363
kept from the defence?

1602
02:03:50,247 --> 02:03:52,238
- Give us an answer!
- Answer the question!

1603
02:03:53,007 --> 02:03:54,918
Silence!

1604
02:03:55,007 --> 02:03:58,044
- It's about time!
- Order in the court!

1605
02:03:59,447 --> 02:04:02,245
My Lord, I would like
to approach the bench.

1606
02:04:02,287 --> 02:04:03,879
This is most irregular.

1607
02:04:03,967 --> 02:04:06,640
Yes. I am aware of that, My Lord.

1608
02:04:07,527 --> 02:04:09,404
Very well.

1609
02:04:24,847 --> 02:04:27,407
Mr Dixon, you may stand down.

1610
02:04:28,967 --> 02:04:32,277
This is the man
who should be under arrest!

1611
02:04:32,367 --> 02:04:34,562
Be silent, Mrs Peirce!

1612
02:04:34,647 --> 02:04:36,956
- This court is now in recess.
- Guards, get ready.

1613
02:04:37,047 --> 02:04:39,436
Don't try and make me
the fall guy...

1614
02:04:39,527 --> 02:04:42,485
for the whole
British legal establishment.

1615
02:04:46,567 --> 02:04:48,637
If I accept this mercy deal--

1616
02:04:48,727 --> 02:04:50,638
They have a flipping cheek,
offering me mercy.

1617
02:04:50,727 --> 02:04:52,638
They should be begging
for mercy themselves.

1618
02:04:52,727 --> 02:04:54,399
- You ready, Mr Conlon?
- Aye.

1619
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:56,557
I know the difference
between right and wrong.

1620
02:04:56,647 --> 02:04:59,247
The truth has to come out.
They may not want to hear it...

1621
02:04:59,247 --> 02:05:01,247
but there's people outside
who'll listen.

1622
02:05:01,247 --> 02:05:03,807
-Just think about it, will you?
- All right.

1623
02:05:03,887 --> 02:05:06,037
Aye. Give us three of them.

1624
02:05:21,767 --> 02:05:23,359
Silence!

1625
02:05:26,007 --> 02:05:28,646
In the matter of Her Majesty...

1626
02:05:28,727 --> 02:05:31,525
versus Gerard Patrick Conlon...

1627
02:05:31,607 --> 02:05:34,519
the case is hereby dismissed.

1628
02:05:39,247 --> 02:05:41,442
My husband died in your prison
an innocent man!

1629
02:05:41,527 --> 02:05:44,837
I'm going out the front door.
I'll see you outside.

1630
02:05:44,927 --> 02:05:46,963
- This way.
- I'm going out the front door.

1631
02:05:47,047 --> 02:05:48,321
What about Giuseppe Conlon?

1632
02:05:48,407 --> 02:05:51,240
Your Honour,
he was an innocent man!

1633
02:05:53,927 --> 02:05:55,679
Mr Conlon, that's not a good idea.

1634
02:05:55,767 --> 02:05:57,519
Use the back,
for security reasons.

1635
02:05:57,607 --> 02:05:59,677
I'm a free man,
and I'm going out the front door.

1636
02:06:00,807 --> 02:06:04,322
In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Paul Hill...

1637
02:06:04,407 --> 02:06:08,036
the case is hereby dismissed.

1638
02:06:14,847 --> 02:06:19,045
Leave me alone!
I'm going out the front door with Gerry!

1639
02:06:21,367 --> 02:06:26,361
In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Patrick Armstrong...

1640
02:06:26,447 --> 02:06:28,438
the case is hereby dismissed.

1641
02:06:30,607 --> 02:06:35,237
In the matter of
Her Majesty versus Carole Richardson...

1642
02:06:35,287 --> 02:06:38,757
the case is hereby dismissed.

1643
02:06:38,847 --> 02:06:40,360
I'm an innocent man!

1644
02:06:40,447 --> 02:06:44,281
I spent 1 5 years in prison
for something I didn't do!

1645
02:06:44,367 --> 02:06:46,278
I watched my father die...

1646
02:06:46,367 --> 02:06:49,245
in a British prison
for something he didn't do!

1647
02:06:49,287 --> 02:06:52,245
And this government
still says he's guilty!

1648
02:06:52,327 --> 02:06:53,999
I want to tell them...

1649
02:06:54,247 --> 02:06:57,239
that until my father
is proved innocent...

1650
02:06:57,287 --> 02:07:01,360
until all the people involved
in this case are proved innocent...

1651
02:07:01,447 --> 02:07:03,961
until the guilty ones
are brought to justice...

1652
02:07:04,047 --> 02:07:06,247
I will fight on...

1653
02:07:06,247 --> 02:07:09,876
in the name of my father
and of the truth!
