1
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,960
I was the hero of Hughes Creek.

2
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,200
I can still see the glint in me
da's eye as he looked down at me..

3
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,440
his hand on me shoulder.

4
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,200
What did he call me that day?
Ah, what did Da call me?

5
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,400
That's right. He
called me Sunshine.

6
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,760
You're a pretty girl.

7
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,320
You're Wild Wright's
horse, aren't ya?

8
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,840
I know whose ya are.
It's all right.

9
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,120
I'll look after ya.

10
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,760
Handsome-looking horse you got there, Ned.
You're cuttin'a flash, all right.

11
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,680
Ah, great.

12
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,640
You're Ned Kelly, aren't ya?
Red Kelly's boy?

13
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,960
Get down, Jane.

14
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,720
Fine animal you got there.

15
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,920
- Distinctive, wouldn't you say?
- She's Wild Wright's.

16
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,240
- That's the postmaster's mare.
- No, it isn't. It's Wild Wright's.

17
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,528
He lost her when she
bolted into the bushes.

18
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,760
You're a liar, Kelly.

19
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,368
No, I'm not. I found her
this morning, grazing.

20
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,920
She's been reported stolen.

21
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,680
- Stolen, me arse!
- A horse thief!

22
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,840
- Get your hands off me!
- You're under arrest.

23
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,320
Stand, Kelly, or I swear to
God, I'll shoot you down.

24
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,160
- I was only going after the horse.
- You were trying to escape.

25
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,600
You're just as thick
as your bloody father.

26
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,928
Jesus Christ! Now, what
are you trying to do?

27
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,320
I could've tanned
your hide for that.

28
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,808
Strike an officer, and
you'll bloody swing for it!

29
00:05:27,821 --> 00:05:30,240
Strike you down to the ground!

30
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,520
- No blows struck yet, Constable Hall!
- Help me, someone!

31
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,200
Help him! Help Constable Hall!
Poor Constable Hall!

32
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,588
He's such a fuckin' rat!

33
00:05:37,601 --> 00:05:38,920
He's trying to kill me,
the rascally blackguard!

34
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,880
- Help me, someone!
- Stand put! Go on! Put me down!

35
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,920
He tried to shoot me, for Christ's sake!
All right! All right!

36
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,000
Is that the best you can
do, you bloody coward?

37
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,280
Go on. I can take it.

38
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,320
That's enough!

39
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,080
Hello there! Please,
can you help me?

40
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,800
Hello! Hello there! Please!
Slow it down, please!

41
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Come on! Come on! Please!

42
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,200
Please, now! Oh, come on!
Give us a ride, you bastards!

43
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:53,160
Christ, it's muddy
enough to bog a dog.

44
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,120
- So, where'd you go after Beechworth?
- May Day Hills on a road gang.

45
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,000
Ah, you see Sean Gallagher?
I heard he was up there.

46
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,600
Yeah. I saw him for a while.

47
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,960
Hey. I think that's old man Wicks and..
What's his daughter called?

48
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,360
- Sarah.
- Sarah. That's right. She's a picture.

49
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,760
Oh, we could be in love, boys.

50
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,240
Mr Wicks, good mornin'.

51
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:24,880
Mr Wicks, I don't know if you remember me.
I'm Aaron Sherritt, Mr Wicks.

52
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,528
If you could just hold
up for one moment..

53
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:28,120
If anyone can persuade..

54
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,760
an old man to share his daughter with
three larrikins like us, it'll be hard.

55
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,640
So how's me ma?

56
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,468
What?

57
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,240
Ah, the coppers have been
giving her a hard time, Ned.

58
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,680
Something goes missin',
a bullock or anything..

59
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,208
they come round the
middle of the night, tear

60
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,680
the place apart, scarin'
the kiddies and all.

61
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
- She's had it hard.
- Come on, lads!

62
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,080
- Jump up!
- Well, will you look at that.

63
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,360
What did I tell ya?

64
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,600
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thanks a lot, Mr Wicks.

65
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:04,160
Thank you, Mr Wicks.

66
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:14,160
Dan!

67
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,520
Ma, there's someone coming.

68
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,200
Oh, God. It's Ned.

69
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,720
Neddy!

70
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,400
Mommy, I named
Hobson's kookaburra.

71
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,440
- What did you name him, darlin'?
- Beefy, 'cause he likes beef.

72
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,128
Well, that's a fine name
for a kookaburra, Grace.

73
00:08:44,141 --> 00:08:45,760
Who's the proud father, Ma?

74
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,800
Don't even ask. He's a long time gone.
That's all there is to it.

75
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,520
- The stinkin' Proddy.
- He was a Yank.

76
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,240
George the baker. We were
married, Ned, right and proper.

77
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,440
Well, that's grand, Ma.

78
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,880
Christ! Will you stop messin'?
I'm sick of the pair of ya.

79
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Give your mother some respect, or I'll give
ya a hidin', both of youse, ya hear me?

80
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,320
- And who are you, anyways?
- Steve Hart.

81
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,480
Well, seein' as how the two
of you are so full of beans..

82
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,360
you can both get off your asses
and help me fix up this place.

83
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,948
You haven't done a minute's
work to help your ma, have you?

84
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,480
Come on, everyone.

85
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,840
- Sit down, now.
- What kind of stew is it?

86
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,000
Wombat. A wombat's a marsupial,
and it lives in a hole.

87
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,640
I know, darlin; I put
one in the stew.

88
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,080
Shh. Da-da-da. La-la-la.

89
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,040
Ned, would you like
to say the grace?

90
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,440
All right.

91
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:41,000
Dear Lord, thank you for
looking after me mother..

92
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,840
me sister Grace, me sister
Kate and me brother Dan.

93
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,868
Thank you, Lord, for our
beautiful baby Ellen..

94
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:51,920
Shh, shh, shh.

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,640
And for this wonderful
stew made out of wombat.

96
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,840
- Amen.
- Amen.

97
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,080
Amen.

98
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,240
It's not easy for an Irishman
in Queen Victoria's colony..

99
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,320
to walk the straight
and narrow..

100
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,240
but I toed the line..

101
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,640
despite all temptations.

102
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,040
- With me fighting with
my fists for money.

103
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:13,080
And after all, I did three
years for that stolen horse.

104
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,120
Wild Wright only got 18 months. You
think I was gonna let that one slide?

105
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:27,440
I declare Ned the winner!

106
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:32,320
Bets are in.

107
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,840
So, are we square?

108
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,760
Course we are, you mad bugger.
Come here!

109
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,480
Thank Christ for that!

110
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:58,400
Could it be possible that the
Kellys were finally getting ahead?

111
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:03,680
That I could actually
better meself?

112
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,320
Steady.

113
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,720
Excuse me. You there.

114
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,388
Would you mind coming and
holding my horse's thing?

115
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:23,000
All right.

116
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,480
Steady.

117
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,800
Now, what thing are you
talkin' about, ma'am?

118
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,480
Are you gonna help me or not?

119
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,440
I've been riding him pretty
hard the last two days.

120
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,968
Poor thing's been holding
on since Saturday.

121
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:41,440
His bladder's paralyzed
with the colic.

122
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,160
- Good God.
- Have you got that?

123
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,800
- Right there. Good. Good.
- Just hold it there.

124
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,760
Keep still.

125
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:57,160
I'm glad that's not me. Christ.

126
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:02,320
- Steady.
- Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy.

127
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,360
Okay. All right.

128
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,400
Watch your boots, boys! Whoo!

129
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,508
It looks like you've done
this kind of thing before.

130
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:13,560
Only on horses.

131
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,880
Thank God for that.

132
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,200
My name's Ned Kelly.
Pleased to meet ya.

133
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,920
- Hello, Ned.
- Right.

134
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,720
Watch out, lads! Here he goes again!
Clear the way!

135
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,240
The horse is too wild.
It can't be broken.

136
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,120
A waste of damn money.
Fetch my rifle, please.

137
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:56,080
What? You can't just shoot
a horse 'cause it's wild.

138
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,968
What else can we do?
We can't keep it here.

139
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:01,800
Why don't you set it free?

140
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:06,120
I could break that horse
for you if you like.

141
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,828
I've broken horses before.
You can ask around.

142
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,640
I'd like to give it
a try, at least.

143
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,960
We know there's not much point.

144
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:23,040
The horse is bad.

145
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,480
You know, the Chinese say you should have
only one true love in your entire life..

146
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,360
otherwise you are no better than
a mangy dog or a loose woman.

147
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,439
What did he say? Good
thing I'm not Chinese.

148
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,600
What did he say?

149
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,560
He said what a lucky fellow I am
to be with such a beauty as you.

150
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,840
Too lucky, if you ask me.

151
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:41,240
Oh, hello, Kate. I
didn't see you there.

152
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,840
- Fancy seeing you here.
- I'm just having a swift pint after work.

153
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,120
It's not like I'm a regular or anything. A
man needs to relax after a hard day's work.

154
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,080
What would you know about
a hard day's work?

155
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,200
Sleeping and drinking and beatin' up
yellow fellows is all you ever seem to do.

156
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:01,240
That's not fair, now.
I'm only doing me job.

157
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,760
I get along with everybody.
Everybody gets along with me.

158
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,560
- Can I buy you a drink?
- No, thank you. I have money.

159
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,840
- I just wanna buy you a drink.
- I said I don't want one.

160
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,080
You're startin' to get
on me nerves now.

161
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,200
Think you're too good for me?
Is that it?

162
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,428
Who do you think you are?

163
00:17:32,441 --> 00:17:34,600
Let go of me bloody arm.
You're hurtin' me.

164
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,800
- Let go of her arm, you.
- I'm just bein' friendly, Ned.

165
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,320
Just offering the
young lady a drink.

166
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,128
She doesn't want one
from the likes of you.

167
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:46,880
A problem there, Fitzpatrick?

168
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,640
No. There's no problem
here, Constable.

169
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm sorry if I upset you.. Kate.

170
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,920
Right. This one's a
request from Ned Kelly.

171
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,400
Right. Follow me, lads.
One, two.

172
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,788
The nerve of the bloody knacker.
Look at him.

173
00:18:21,801 --> 00:18:24,440
Acts as if he owns the place.

174
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:30,200
Come here and dance with your sister!
Come on!

175
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,000
That fella needs taking down a
peg or two, that's for sure.

176
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,600
- Ned, the horses are gone.
- What?

177
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,840
The biggest thieves and liars
the sun ever shone on.

178
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,000
The Victorian police.

179
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,840
Well, I'm telling you
something now, boys.

180
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:36,600
I'm not gonna let these bloody
maggots put one over on me.

181
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,680
To change a horse's brand is
easy, easier than you'd think.

182
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:57,120
You just pluck the little hairs
and prick the skin with iodine.

183
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,720
A "C"or an "O" can become a "Q."

184
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,280
"Q"for "Quinn".. me
mother's maiden name.

185
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,880
Who's that at this
hour of the night?

186
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:42,120
- Dan, is Kate in?
- Yeah, she is.

187
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:47,480
Well, would you mind telling her I'd
like a word, please? In private, like.

188
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,308
No, I won't. She wants
nothing to do with you.

189
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,080
You know that full well.

190
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Well, I'd like to hear that
from her, if you don't mind.

191
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,160
Fitzpatrick, you've already heard
that from her many's the time.

192
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Will you do yourself a favour.
Take a ride home.

193
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,040
- You think you're so smart.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:07,840
- I've a warrant for you.
- You've no warrant, you fool.

195
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,440
A Kelly stole them horses. I know it
was, and I have a warrant for you.

196
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Ned and all. I've
warrants for both of ya.

197
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,760
I don't suppose I could see
them warrants, could I?

198
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,480
There's your warrants. Hmm?
There's your warrants.

199
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,680
Oh, hello.

200
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,320
I just came down to
find my riding jacket.

201
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,200
I thought I left
it here somewhere.

202
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,040
I haven't seen it.

203
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,560
I was sure it was here.

204
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,880
If I find it, I'll be sure to
bring it up to the house for ya.

205
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,720
- All right then.
- Right.

206
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,680
- You're from England?
- Yes.

207
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Surrey, actually. You're Irish?

208
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,808
Yeah. Me da was from Tipperary,
but I was born here.

209
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,800
I've never been to Ireland.

210
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,240
I came over when I was 17.

211
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,880
Richard acquired the land
through his family, and..

212
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,320
My da had to go to all the trouble of
stealing a sheep to get the trip over here.

213
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,200
He got a free fare then.
He was lucky.

214
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,520
Yeah.

215
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:42,640
- How are you tonight?
- Fine. Till you showed up.

216
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,160
Drink, boys?

217
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,120
- Steve?
- I don't drink with coppers.

218
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,920
Aye. There's no need for that.

219
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,480
So I'm leaving here tomorrow. The
work here for me is finished now.

220
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,960
Yes. I know.

221
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,560
So I won't be seeing
you any more.

222
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,080
You sure you don't want to have a
better look for that riding jacket?

223
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,800
No. I.. I must have left
it in the house somewhere.

224
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,720
Well, it was nice
to have met you.

225
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,760
I really should go.

226
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,640
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

227
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,188
You don't have any
warrants at all, do you?

228
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:16,680
Oh, I do, Mrs Kelly. I do.

229
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:20,360
I don't believe this. You
just plain thick or what?

230
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,160
Come on, Kate. I'm just having
a bit of fun, you know.

231
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,200
Now, let's see those
bloody warrants.

232
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,680
I've split me head open!
You bastards!

233
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,400
- It's your hand, you bloody idiot.
- Hey, Fitzpatrick.

234
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,200
- Bottom rung on top now, huh?
- Shoot him.

235
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,000
- Don't, Dan.
- Give him back his bloody gun.

236
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,600
Go on! Get!

237
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,640
I'll be back for
ya, ya bastards.

238
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,400
Can you believe the brass
neck on that idiot?

239
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,200
Trying to be all
friendly with the grog.

240
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,320
Yeah. He seemed sobered up when
you pointed the gun at him.

241
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,308
See his face?

242
00:27:21,321 --> 00:27:23,240
I'm glad you think
this is all very funny.

243
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:29,400
- Where have you been?
- Never mind where I've been.

244
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,068
What's happened?

245
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:35,480
Fitzpatrick couldn't hold
his brandy and lemonade.

246
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,600
- What are you talking about?
- We had a fight with Fitzpatrick.

247
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:41,320
- A fight? Why?
- He said he had warrants for me and you.

248
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,088
What warrants?

249
00:27:43,101 --> 00:27:44,800
Horse stealing, but there
was a load of shite in it.

250
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,588
Whether it was or wasn't,
there's trouble now either way.

251
00:27:46,601 --> 00:27:48,320
You can't take that seriously.

252
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,080
How can you stand there and act like this
is one big joke, after all the trouble..

253
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:56,240
we've had with coppers
in this family?

254
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,088
What are you thinking, Joe?

255
00:28:01,101 --> 00:28:03,560
You and Dan oughta clear
out for a day or two..

256
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,040
just to be safe.

257
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:09,560
God willing, it'll
all blow over.

258
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,440
What the hell happened to you?

259
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,400
- Ned Kelly shot me.
- He what?

260
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:43,960
Take your rotten hands
off me, you bastard!

261
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,068
Get off her!

262
00:28:46,081 --> 00:28:48,120
You're under arrest! I'm
taking you to the cells!

263
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,640
You filthy bastards!

264
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,000
Ned! Ned!

265
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,600
- Ned. Jesus, Ned, they've arrested Ma.
- They what?

266
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,640
Yeah. They've taken her to the cells,
charged her with attempted murder.

267
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,468
Attempted murder?

268
00:29:15,481 --> 00:29:17,240
And Fitzpatrick's saying
you took a shot at him.

269
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,008
I wasn't even there.

270
00:29:19,021 --> 00:29:20,720
We know that, but it's
your word against his.

271
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,840
Take the word of a drunken liar
and arrest an innocent woman?

272
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,120
Is that right?

273
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,040
I won't take this injustice!
I'm gonna kill him!

274
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,440
I swear I'll scatter his
blood and brains like rain!

275
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,200
- Ned! Ned! No!
- Stand aside!

276
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,600
- No, Ned! Don't make this worse for Ma!
- Stop it, Ned!

277
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,200
Take the children
inside, please.

278
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,120
- What are you doing here?
- They arrested me ma.

279
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,960
- What for?
- The copper says I tried to kill him.

280
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,320
Why?

281
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,040
'Cause he's a bastard liar,
like all coppers. That's why.

282
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,800
The thing is, I
wasn't even there.

283
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,400
I was here with you.

284
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,360
You could tell the truth, show the
swine up for the drunken liar he is.

285
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,000
- And then they'd have to release me ma.
- That's impossible.

286
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,080
I couldn't. Do you realize
what that would mean?

287
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,640
Yes.

288
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,320
I can't. I'd be disgraced.

289
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,880
He'd take away my
children, and..

290
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,520
It's all right. I understand.

291
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,440
- Ned.
- Go ahead. Go ahead.

292
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,880
Right.

293
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,480
I made them an offer
at the outset:

294
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,960
Charge me and let me mother go.

295
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,760
The answer came back: "We
don't bargain with outlaws.

296
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,240
We'll catch you anyway."

297
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:49,480
You see those stretchers?
You know what they're for?

298
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,360
The bastards ain't plannin' on
takin' prisoners, that's for sure.

299
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,800
There's another party down past
the neck of Bullock Creek.

300
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,680
Four of'em. They've hemmed us in on
either side, whether they know it or not.

301
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:10,440
We'll come back at dawn, hold up these
two, take their guns and horses.

302
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,240
At least then we'll have a
chance of making a run for it.

303
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,360
Right.

304
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,080
Drop your arms!

305
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,520
Christ, it's Lonigan, Ned.

306
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,400
You've killed Lonigan.

307
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,480
Do you want marmalade, Ned?

308
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,680
Are you gonna kill me or what?

309
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,028
I'll leave the force first
thing tomorrow morning.

310
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:35,920
I swear it on me mother's life.

311
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,440
Ned.

312
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,160
- Jesus Christ.
- Do as I said, and no one will get shot.

313
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,120
Sergeant, you'd better surrender.
You're surrounded.

314
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:23,200
You been into the whisky
again, you old sod?

315
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:27,360
- Get some toast on, Lonigan.
- Lonigan's gone, and you two'll be next..

316
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,760
If you don't get off
them damn horses.

317
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,000
Oh, Christ!

318
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,520
Give it up, man! It's over!

319
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,840
Will you stop running? I
won't shoot you. I swear.

320
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,440
Why didn't you surrender?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

321
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,400
I can't breathe!

322
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:47,680
- No! I can't breathe!
- Right, right, right.

323
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,440
Listen. It's okay.

324
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,280
I can't breathe.

325
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,560
One minute. One minute.
One minute.

326
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,920
- It's all right. It's all right.
- Oh!

327
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:11,120
Why did you have to run?
I wouldn't have shot ya.

328
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,360
God damn. Look. No.

329
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,240
- I don't wanna die like this.
- No. No. I'm sorry I shot you.

330
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,040
I don't wanna.. I got a
wife and two children.

331
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,040
What are they gonna do without me?
What are they gonna do without..

332
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,440
- No!
- Look at me. Look at me.

333
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,640
God forgive me!

334
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,760
God forgive me.

335
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,360
I don't know why I
took his watch.

336
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,240
It was something to do
with him not needing it.

337
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,560
Later, I thought about
sending it to his family.

338
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,480
But by then, the papers had me
down as some sort of monster..

339
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,400
so I thought, "No point now.

340
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:10,720
I'm damned anyway."

341
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,880
Is it true what they've been
saying about the three coppers?

342
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,040
Yeah, it's true.

343
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,360
Oh, God.

344
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,000
It was a fair fight, Ma.

345
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:38,440
Better them than Ned.

346
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:42,120
They'll kill him now.

347
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,400
They'll kill him for sure.

348
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,480
Don't shoot, lad. I'm unarmed.

349
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,440
Come on. Put that away.
There aren't any troops.

350
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,640
Aw.

351
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,528
You're bloody chirpy for
this hour of the morning.

352
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,360
Gotta keep your voice down.

353
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,480
- I've a visitor.
- Who?

354
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,080
- Mary Hegarty.
- Mary Hegarty!

355
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,760
- Mm.
- Jesus. She can be only 13.

356
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,640
I'm not superstitious. Well,
well, well, well, well.

357
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:44,040
I've never met a man whose lies are worth
€2,000 before, especially not Irishmen.

358
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,000
- It's €6,000.
- Is that what it's up to?

359
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,120
My cock alone's worth
more than that.

360
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,280
I could do with
the money meself.

361
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,320
I'd build a shed out the
back, buy a few horses.

362
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,680
In fact, I could buy half of
Beechworth with all that.

363
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,280
- That's very funny, Aaron.
- Clause two.

364
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:12,200
They've recalled parliament.

365
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:15,880
Passed something called "The
Felons Apprehension Act."

366
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,720
It means we're
listed as outlaws.

367
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,600
We can be shot on sight
by anyone who chooses.

368
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,560
They said I'd lost what
it meant to be human.

369
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,920
Maybe I never had it
in the first place.

370
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,560
But wasn't this about
protecting the ones I loved..

371
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:53,440
the ones who gave me food and
shelter, even the clothes on me back.

372
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:00,120
And therefore,
wasn't it now a war?

373
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:07,160
Dan, you see that wooden gate?

374
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:10,160
Around the back there is
their living quarters.

375
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,280
If anyone's there,
you keep 'em there.

376
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,640
- Can I help you?
- Yes, you can. Me name's Edward Kelly.

377
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:09,320
- His mates call him Ned.
- Ned Kelly?

378
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,328
I'm sure I've heard
that name somewhere bef..

379
00:44:11,341 --> 00:44:13,280
I'm sure you have, sir.

380
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,560
Stay where you are.

381
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:23,640
What do you think you're doing?
Who are you?

382
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,360
Going to a funeral, eh? Better do
as I say, or it'll be your own.

383
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,440
- Ma.
- Shh.

384
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:33,120
- Fanny Shaw, what are you doing here?
- I work here.

385
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,160
- I can't believe it.
- What are you doing here, Steve?

386
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:41,880
We're robbing the bank. Me and Fanny
used to go to school together.

387
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,280
Steve. Hello, kiddies.

388
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,480
- You're Ned Kelly.
- That's right.

389
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:58,040
What are you going
to do with us?

390
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,080
You're coming with us to Faithfulls Creek.
We can't leave anyone behind..

391
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
to raise the alarm, now, can we?

392
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,840
Mr Kelly, we are supposed to
be attending a funeral today.

393
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,600
As you can see, I'm
dressed in mourning wear.

394
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,040
Obviously unsuitable for a woman travelling
in the countryside, hostage or not.

395
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,760
- Even a blackguard like yourself..
- Susan!

396
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,800
I do apologize for
my wife's behaviour.

397
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,880
There is no need to apologize
on my account, Charles.

398
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,080
The man is wearing a magenta
cravat, for God's sake.

399
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,560
I have an outfit just
arrived from Melbourne.

400
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,920
L'eau du Nil silk.

401
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,400
Well, you'd better put it on then.
Go on.

402
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,648
Joe, you should follow
her, make sure she doesn't

403
00:45:45,661 --> 00:45:47,840
signal from the windows
with her bloomers.

404
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:59,000
- How dare you!
- Sure. I'm doing no harm.

405
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,480
What are these, these skulls?

406
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:11,240
- I collect them.
- Hello.

407
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,600
So you're Joe Byrne?

408
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:20,400
The papers say you have the facial
features of a creature born to crime.

409
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,160
I'm the handsome
one in the bunch.

410
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,608
They also said you married
a Spanish housemaid

411
00:46:25,621 --> 00:46:28,000
in Diniliquin with the
exotic name of Madela.

412
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,320
We were just good friends.

413
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,400
Mm. I suppose you have
a lot of good friends.

414
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:43,520
I'm sure there's no
harm in being friendly.

415
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:50,600
No, I don't suppose there is.

416
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Oh, you're a beast..

417
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:59,360
an absolute beast.

418
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,560
She's taking an
awfully long time.

419
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,600
He just fell off the other
side right into a puddle.

420
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,688
You'll never guess who
I ran into last week.

421
00:47:10,701 --> 00:47:11,720
Who?

422
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,188
Danny O'Reilly. He's working
on the new rail line.

423
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:16,600
He's got a wife and three kids.

424
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,560
Sure. That's grand. I haven't
seen him in at least three years.

425
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,920
That's like one kid every year.

426
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,160
Hey, Ned. Look at this.

427
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:34,360
Mortgages. One of'em's for
old man Wick's place.

428
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:37,880
- I recognize a couple of the others too.
- They're of no use to you.

429
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,748
They're the only records I
have of the bank's debtors.

430
00:47:39,761 --> 00:47:41,560
Can I have them back, please?

431
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,400
No.

432
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,360
So I killed their policeman,
and I robbed their bank..

433
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,520
but burning their mortgages.. well,
that was destroying Crown property.

434
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:05,800
It was like slappin' Queen
Victoria herself across the face.

435
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,880
So they send in Hare,
Superintendent Francis Hare..

436
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:14,040
late of Cape Town, South Africa.

437
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,760
And wasn't this the challenge of
your whole life, Superintendent?

438
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,960
A feather in your cap.
You can't catch me.

439
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,320
You don't have a hope of catching
me, so you take my friends instead.

440
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:29,360
Over a hundred men arrested, stuck
in stinkin'cells without trial..

441
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,440
while their crops
perish in the fields.

442
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:45,840
And guess what. Not one of'em caves
in and tries to claim the reward..

443
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,880
not one of'em.

444
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:51,040
They loved me just the same and hated
you all the more, didn't they?

445
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,440
Did you really think I was
gonna let 'em all rot?

446
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:01,948
Two and a half thousand pounds.
There's enough

447
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:04,040
to pay rent on the
leaseholds for lads in jail.

448
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,920
Thomas, you can take what you need for your
mother to pay off her debt to McTeague.

449
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:08,468
Thanks, Ned.

450
00:49:08,481 --> 00:49:09,960
And there's some for
McKinleys and Bill Skilling..

451
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:13,320
whatever he needs for his da.

452
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,640
Have you heard
anything about me ma?

453
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,400
They set a trial at the end of last month.
She's been given three years hard labour.

454
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,600
I'm sorry, Ned.

455
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,480
I say, give me that back.

456
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,040
That blackguard just
stole my watch.

457
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,048
They say the Lord helps
those who help themselves.

458
00:49:38,061 --> 00:49:40,000
Give him back his watch.

459
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:45,720
- What? - You heard what I said. I
said, give him back his damn watch.

460
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:49,920
Have you gone simple all of a sudden?
We're robbing the bank.

461
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,148
Listen here, kid. This is
the last time I tell ya..

462
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,320
Give him back his damn watch.

463
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:05,840
You're not innocent men. You're
a bunch of common criminals.

464
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,200
Did you hear that? If we act like common
thieves, that's just what they'll call us.

465
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,880
My mother is rotting
away in a prison cell..

466
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,200
because of the lies of a
policeman named Fitzpatrick.

467
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,360
She's an innocent woman, and
so are these boys here.

468
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,280
My Irish brethren have been
unlawfully imprisoned..

469
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:45,120
and blacklisted from
their selections.

470
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:51,080
How do you expect me to behave other
than to stand up against this treatment?

471
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:58,520
Any one of you here can take a shot
at me and not be charged for it.

472
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:01,720
There's me gun.

473
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,600
Any of you feeling brave
enough, go ahead.

474
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,800
No?

475
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,400
That's what I thought.

476
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:18,440
So if I can beg your patience,
this is my statement..

477
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:22,400
to the Premier of
Victoria, Graham Berry..

478
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,400
and you here are my witnesses.

479
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:28,000
Joe, take out a pen and paper.
We'll write ourselves a letter.

480
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,320
Dear Sir..

481
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,120
Dear Sir..

482
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,520
"Dear Sir..

483
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:48,040
"I wish to acquaint you with
some of the occurrences..

484
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,000
"of the present,
past and future."

485
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:57,240
"It will pay government to give
those people who are suffering.."

486
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,440
justice and liberty.

487
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,160
"..justice and liberty.

488
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:08,720
"I seek revenge for the evil
name given me and my relations.

489
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,720
By the light that shines,
this is my warning."

490
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,000
My brother and
sisters and mother..

491
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:19,640
have to put up with the brutal and
cowardly conduct of a parcel of..

492
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,360
- "..big, ugly.." ..big,
ugly, fat-necked..

493
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,120
- "..fat-necked.."
- Wombat-headed.

494
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:27,800
Wombat-headed.

495
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:30,440
"..wombat-headed, big-bellied.."

496
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,208
Magpie-legged!

497
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:33,920
Magpie-legged. Thank
you very much, ma'am.

498
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,520
Joe, write that down.
Magpie-legged.

499
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:39,920
"..narrow-hipped, splaw-footed..

500
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,600
sons of Irish bailiffs.."

501
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:46,280
Or English landlords better known as what?
Victorian police.

502
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:55,320
This section here you might find
less amusing, Superintendent.

503
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:58,720
I give fair warning to all those
who have reason to fear me..

504
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,200
not to attempt to
reside in Victoria.

505
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,720
Neglect this and abide
by the consequences..

506
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,600
which shall be worse than
than the rust in the wheat.

507
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:12,720
I do not wish to give this order
full force without timely warning..

508
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,280
but I am a widow's
son outlawed..

509
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:19,040
and my orders must be obeyed.

510
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,800
Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly.

511
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,560
- Look!
- Oh, my God.

512
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,000
It's Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne.

513
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,400
Can I get a kiss then?

514
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,600
Of course you can.

515
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,720
And a ladies' man, eh?

516
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,600
Where will you go, Ned?

517
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,720
The country belongs to us.

518
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,800
And we'll go wherever we like.

519
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,400
I hear you're planning on getting
married, starting a family.

520
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,640
Well, I'll tell you this, lad.

521
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,920
Lack of cooperation will
make it very hard for me..

522
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,520
to get you out of here and
back to that girl of yours.

523
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,920
I got nothing to tell you.

524
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,808
I don't need to tell you
about the reward out.

525
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:07,640
It's a lot of money.

526
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,320
You could put it to good use.

527
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:19,120
You're a friend of Joseph
Byrne, aren't you?

528
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,960
You've known each other
since childhood..

529
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,920
served time together,
isn't that right?

530
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,920
Aaron, it's the Kellys we want.

531
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:31,320
We don't care about Joe.

532
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,280
If we let this run its course..

533
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,280
he'll be shot down
like the others.

534
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:40,360
The only chance your
friend will have..

535
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,360
depends on you.

536
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,840
If you'll help me with this..

537
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,400
I'll guarantee his safety.

538
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,320
Ned!

539
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,520
Jesus Christ. Come on.

540
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,320
Let's go.

541
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,800
Sir.

542
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:13,080
They've poisoned it.

543
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,240
Lying low, living in caves,
you get to learn sometimes.

544
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:29,520
Eventually, you can read
soils and rocks like books.

545
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,800
I've watched gravel fade.

546
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,720
Dust settle into crust.

547
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,800
I've seen drips of water..

548
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:56,080
turn to stone that
defied gravity.

549
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:10,200
I've turned blood
red with cave mud.

550
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,720
I've been a bloody rock.

551
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,720
Aaah! Oh!

552
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:27,600
Sorry.

553
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:30,440
Wait.. Please.

554
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,880
Can you help..

555
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:36,680
to scrub my back?

556
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,160
I can't reach.

557
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:45,840
Where's your husband?

558
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,040
Out looking for you, like
the rest of the country.

559
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,720
You took a risk coming here.

560
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,200
Well, turn me in so.

561
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,488
You think God'll forgive
us for what we've done, Ned?

562
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:09,400
I don't know.

563
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,000
I suppose we're all
gonna find out one day.

564
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:19,320
Just thinking of Ma rottin'
away in that cell.

565
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:29,400
Where do you think Da
is, heaven or hell?

566
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,400
No. He wouldn't be
in hell, you know.

567
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,320
He wasn't such a bad fella. He..

568
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,400
He was just a dumb paddy who
got picked on his whole life.

569
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,920
And that does something
to your pride, you know?

570
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,280
Can't even picture him.

571
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:57,120
When I was 10 and they gave
me that green-and-gold sash..

572
01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:00,200
for saving that kid
from drowning..

573
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,520
that was the last
time I remember him.

574
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,680
He was proud of me that day.

575
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,440
We gonna be okay, Ned?

576
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,440
Of course we are, you
little gorn, you.

577
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,960
You're just gonna keep
running, aren't you?

578
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,840
They'll catch you eventually..

579
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,480
or shoot you down.

580
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,240
Did you know they pardoned Frank
Gardiner in New South Wales?

581
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,320
On condition he left the colony.

582
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,360
- He gave himself in.
- He wasn't an Irishman.

583
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,508
Then why don't you just
leave the county now,

584
01:03:58,521 --> 01:04:00,600
try for a new life
somewhere in Queensland?

585
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,920
No. I can't. It's not about me.

586
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,480
You know there's more
to it than that.

587
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,000
What would it take to make
you save yourself, Ned?

588
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:15,120
Hmm? My husband's best stallion? Take it.
It's yours. Forget the mares.

589
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:18,560
- More than that. Much more.
- What then?

590
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,720
The red one, too,
would be nice..

591
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,520
with you atop of it, beside me.

592
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:32,880
For that you'd save yourself,
leave your friends behind?

593
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:37,000
And you your children.

594
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:44,520
Look.

595
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,720
You and me had no business with one
another in the first place, did we?

596
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:52,080
Wasn't that the
whole point of it?

597
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,240
Don't make me grieve for you.

598
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:15,320
I ain't dead yet.

599
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,800
Rebel!

600
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,480
- Kate. It's all right! It's us!
- Oh.. Oh, you bloody swine!

601
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:45,720
It's Ned. I know. Come here.

602
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,320
- Oh, my God.
- Now, Gracie, look at you.

603
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,560
You've grown too much.
Give us a cuddle. Come on.

604
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:57,000
Rebel, come on. Come on.

605
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:05,640
So..

606
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:08,320
I saw that rascal Aaron
Sherritt the other night.

607
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,080
Oh, yeah? And what
did you give him?

608
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:13,120
Nothing, you little scoundrel.

609
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,348
Hmm.

610
01:06:15,361 --> 01:06:17,520
The thing is, I saw him
talking to this fella..

611
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,760
all friendly like
on the way out.

612
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:23,400
Then the fella comes back here and starts
asking me all sorts of questions about you.

613
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,320
Such as?

614
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:29,320
When did I see you last
and where you were now..

615
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,640
that sorta thing.

616
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:34,920
- Is he a copper, do you think?
- I don't know.

617
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:37,920
Well, it could've been nothing.

618
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,520
I just thought you
ought to know, like.

619
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,600
Thanks, Maggie.

620
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,800
Hello, Aaron.

621
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,080
Joe?

622
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,960
Ned.

623
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:10,040
So how's things, Aaron?

624
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:12,680
Not so bad. Well..

625
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,680
not too bad.

626
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:18,120
I've been reading a
lot about you, Ned.

627
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,920
You're a real terror
altogether, aren't you?

628
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,720
We've been meaning to
talk to you, Aaron.

629
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:26,120
We were wondering if you'd
consider acting as a scout for us.

630
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,720
We're heading into Beechworth
to rob a bank there.

631
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,800
A scout? Well, I'm flattered you'd
think of me, lads, but, uh..

632
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:37,640
- You're not interested?
- No. I-I'd love to.

633
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:41,720
If it was just up to me, I'd be in
there like a shot. You know that.

634
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:44,320
But I've got the missus
to think about now.

635
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,128
Because between you and me,
lads, she's up the spout.

636
01:07:46,141 --> 01:07:47,880
Ah, she isn't?

637
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:49,880
- Ah, sure, that's grand.
- Congratulations, Aaron.

638
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:53,720
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

639
01:07:53,800 --> 01:07:57,080
- How are Dan and Steve?
- They're fine.

640
01:07:57,160 --> 01:07:59,640
Say hello to them
for me, will you?

641
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:03,640
We will.

642
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,240
Well, I'd best get
back to the party.

643
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:10,120
Mary will be wondering
where I got to.

644
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,960
Sure. You go on and look
after that girl of yours.

645
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,320
Ahh.

646
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,400
I will indeed.

647
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,880
Sorry I can't help you out.
Good luck with it all anyways.

648
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:49,680
Aaron, what are you doing?

649
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,480
Some coppers on horses
followed me until Wangaratta..

650
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,720
but I met up with Tom Lloyd and Bill and
we gave 'em the slip easy as you please.

651
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,800
- That's good.
- Here we go.

652
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,600
That's great, Katie.

653
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,408
Yeah, well, I wish I'd
never bloody bothered.

654
01:10:18,421 --> 01:10:20,160
You're all gonna get
yourselves killed.

655
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:22,320
- We are not.
- You bloody well are!

656
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:26,000
No, we're not, Katie. We're gonna give 'em
a show like they've never seen before.

657
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,920
There's a certain type
of black tribesman..

658
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,040
that bends in the wind..

659
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,880
blends into the background.

660
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,800
Mostly he employs the
help of the dead..

661
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,000
to destroy other people.

662
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,560
The "Night Dancer,
" they call him.

663
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:08,920
God, when is someone gonna
give me some proper cards.

664
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,120
Who's in?

665
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:16,240
Ugh. Fold.

666
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,308
I'm turning in.

667
01:11:18,321 --> 01:11:20,320
I guess all that losin'
would make you tired.

668
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:25,120
- You in or you out?
- Gimme three.

669
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,400
- You?
- I'm out.

670
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:37,480
What's happening?

671
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,560
Go back to sleep, love.

672
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:42,600
Here. I call.

673
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,120
Three to the English queen.

674
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,800
It's blessed you are, Nigel.

675
01:11:49,120 --> 01:11:51,120
Aaron!

676
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,240
- Aaron!
- Who's that?

677
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,560
Who is it?

678
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:20,880
Another one of your
whores, it looks like.

679
01:12:20,960 --> 01:12:24,560
Just tell her to get lost, unless
she wants her head blown off.

680
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,560
Lizzie, is that you?

681
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:59,520
Joe.

682
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,120
Why do you think he did it?

683
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,800
Just for the money?

684
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:42,240
Maybe he started thinking he
was some kind of big shot..

685
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,680
instead of a shit-kicker's
son, like us.

686
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,400
We have received word that
one of our informants..

687
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,400
has been shot dead
by the Kelly gang..

688
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:08,560
over near Beechworth.

689
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,800
We will entrain immediately
and proceed to Wangaratta.

690
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,120
From there, you'll be
split up into units..

691
01:14:14,200 --> 01:14:16,120
and will fan out
across the country..

692
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,160
encircling the
immediate vicinity.

693
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,560
Stay close to your
troop commanders..

694
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,920
for your orders of march.

695
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:26,720
I would remind you all..

696
01:14:26,800 --> 01:14:29,760
the men we are hunting have not
only plundered two banks..

697
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,640
kidnapped men, women
and children..

698
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:35,720
but have murdered three
of your fellow officers.

699
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,840
They have outrun us
before, gentlemen.

700
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:43,320
Do not allow them
to do so again.

701
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:45,880
Don't you worry, sir. We'll
show the bloody animals.

702
01:14:45,960 --> 01:14:48,680
We'll blow 'em all
to kingdom come.

703
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:53,120
These are not
animals, Constable.

704
01:14:53,200 --> 01:14:57,320
These are men who have been glorified
as the leaders of a movement..

705
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:00,720
a movement that threatens the
stability of an entire country.

706
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:04,840
Underestimate them, and it will be you
who will be blown to kingdom come.

707
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:27,920
They say the trouble
with the Irish..

708
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,120
is that they rely too
much on dreams..

709
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:32,400
and not enough on gunpowder.

710
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,720
Whereas the English were
shy on dreams, as usual..

711
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,720
but had plenty of the other.

712
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,080
Now we had both.

713
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:51,880
- I suppose you're the Great Orlando.
- That I am.

714
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,920
Well, I'm the Great Ned Kelly, and
this here is the Fabulous Joe Byrne.

715
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:57,280
We'd like to join your circus.

716
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,920
Ohh.

717
01:16:15,080 --> 01:16:17,040
Mm.

718
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,920
That's right. You're not seeing things.
It's a camel.

719
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,968
I've got a lion and some
ponies back down the road.

720
01:16:32,981 --> 01:16:34,960
And the Great Orlando of course.

721
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:37,360
If you're here to rob the
train, you're too late.

722
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,680
We're not here to rob the train.

723
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,040
Joe, get this lot inside.

724
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,840
This good-looking fella over
here is me brother, Dan Kelly.

725
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,920
These are my friends:

726
01:17:45,000 --> 01:17:47,520
Joe Byrne at the bar there..

727
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:51,360
and Steve Hart there
in the back corner.

728
01:17:55,400 --> 01:17:57,400
And I'm Ned.

729
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:03,520
We're all Irish boys
and selectors'sons.

730
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,400
Had war declared on us..

731
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:12,800
by Victoria, by New South Wales.

732
01:18:15,680 --> 01:18:17,680
By the crown.

733
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,200
And by the London Times even.

734
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:31,000
The reward on our heads is the biggest
one yet offered in the world.

735
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:33,520
It's up to €8,000.

736
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:36,400
It's a lot of money.

737
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,920
We're the only four lads
in the whole country..

738
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,320
the entire empire, in fact..

739
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,800
that any one of you fine
citizens is allowed to kill..

740
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:54,000
no questions asked.

741
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,200
No, it's true. The
queen said so herself.

742
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:13,600
That's right. It's Regina
versus us, the Kelly gang.

743
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,080
So our plans were set.

744
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:28,920
One. The traitor,
Aaron Sherritt..

745
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,400
dead, as arranged.

746
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,280
Two.

747
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:40,480
The police special from
Benalla coming to meet us.

748
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,120
The line torn up to send the
train to hell, as arranged.

749
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,720
Three. Superintendent
Hare, if he lives..

750
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:53,520
easily worth an outlaw's mother.

751
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:57,520
And four. The townspeople
out of harm's way..

752
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,040
drinks on us, as arranged.

753
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,520
- Here you go.
- Oh, lamb! My favourite.

754
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,640
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

755
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,000
Now, cheer up there, Mr Curnow.

756
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:18,680
You're witness to history.

757
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,720
How many schoolteachers
dream of that?

758
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,040
Come on, Hare. Where
the hell are you?

759
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,480
Were you sleeping?

760
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,240
You thinking of using that?

761
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:28,920
I'm mulling it over.

762
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,520
Right.

763
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,240
You don't remember me, do you?

764
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,520
You were just a boy then.

765
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,400
You were riding a Palomino
mare with a white blaze.

766
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:55,440
Jane. Yeah.

767
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,200
Yeah.

768
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:02,840
Seems like a long
time ago, doesn't it?

769
01:22:06,200 --> 01:22:08,200
A lifetime.

770
01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:35,080
Where's the other fella?

771
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:47,640
Where's Curnow?

772
01:22:50,600 --> 01:22:52,520
Ned, Curnow's gone!

773
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,400
Come on! Give me a hand here!

774
01:23:03,360 --> 01:23:05,280
Quickly!

775
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:07,360
Get those horses off!

776
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:29,400
Knights in shining armour.

777
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:43,480
- Curnow stopped the train.
- Jesus.

778
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:47,480
- What does this mean?
- Hare's on his way.

779
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,120
You mean we didn't
get any of'em?

780
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,160
Not a soul.

781
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:58,000
There'll be a hundred of them..
at least.

782
01:24:11,640 --> 01:24:14,480
You okay, Dan?

783
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,480
Yeah, I'm okay, Ned.

784
01:24:23,240 --> 01:24:25,360
Steve?

785
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:28,600
Short life, but a merry one.

786
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,548
Joe?

787
01:24:33,561 --> 01:24:35,760
We're gonna give them a
good old fight, aren't we?

788
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,760
Well, that's that then.

789
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,280
All right. Everyone
listen to me!

790
01:24:44,360 --> 01:24:47,280
We're getting you out of here!

791
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:26,960
Hold your fire!

792
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,720
We've got women and
children coming out.

793
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:52,600
It's a trick!

794
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,560
Stop your fire! Cease fire!

795
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,000
Hold your fire!

796
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,840
Cease fire!

797
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:12,560
Get down on the floor!

798
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,120
Keep your heads down!
Stay on the floor!

799
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:20,400
They fired at us! They shot him!

800
01:26:20,480 --> 01:26:22,600
Keep as low as you
can, you hear?

801
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:25,040
All right. Let's give it to 'em.

802
01:26:25,120 --> 01:26:27,200
Hit the lights.

803
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:43,520
Fire!

804
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,920
They have armour
on their bodies!

805
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,880
Aim for their arms and legs!

806
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,160
- Ohhh! Ahhh.
- He's been shot!

807
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,320
- They've shot Hare!
- All right. Get back inside.

808
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,800
Get back inside. Come on.

809
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,480
Oh! Dan, reload me pistols!

810
01:28:02,680 --> 01:28:05,000
I got the bastard that shot me.

811
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:07,160
Give me that anyways. Rifle!

812
01:28:10,320 --> 01:28:12,720
Bullets. Come on.

813
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:39,040
Aw. The monkey's been shot!

814
01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:41,840
Poor little bugger!

815
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:46,000
Ah, dear God.

816
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,160
Oh! Shit.

817
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:57,080
Somebody help me,
for Christ's sake!

818
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,440
Keep low! Get around
the back of the bar!

819
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:15,800
Can you find me something
to stop the bleeding?

820
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,280
Get down!

821
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:22,800
To hell with all you bastards!

822
01:29:55,080 --> 01:29:59,000
Ned! Where the hell
are you going?

823
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,200
Get this lot around the back.

824
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:30,160
Ned?

825
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,480
Now's your chance. Quickly!

826
01:30:35,560 --> 01:30:37,800
Out that back door there!

827
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:45,640
Aaah!

828
01:30:45,720 --> 01:30:48,240
Ohhh!

829
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:10,080
Hands up, the lot of you, or
you'll be shot down like dogs!

830
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:12,120
Don't shoot!

831
01:31:16,120 --> 01:31:18,280
I got him! I got Dan Kelly!

832
01:31:19,360 --> 01:31:22,160
No, you bloody well haven't.

833
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,000
Jesus Christ, lads.

834
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,400
I think I need a drink.

835
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:49,360
What I best recall
is riding alone..

836
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:53,880
with the sun behind me..

837
01:32:53,960 --> 01:32:56,560
seeing me own shadow
cantering ahead..

838
01:32:56,640 --> 01:32:59,360
against the roadside
weeds and willows..

839
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,920
and leaving me
stretched far behind..

840
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:05,920
galloping to chase it..

841
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:12,400
Like a centaur in
the picture books.

842
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:06,840
Well done, Ned.

843
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,920
I wore it seriously..

844
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:18,400
me hero sash of green and gold.

845
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:26,240
Proof that I've saved
a life as well.

846
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,320
I'm out of rounds.

847
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,520
Do you have any left?

848
01:35:25,000 --> 01:35:27,000
Only two.

849
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:33,640
I guess that's all we
need then, isn't it?

850
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:36,800
We never stood a chance, did we?

851
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:14,000
No.

852
01:36:17,800 --> 01:36:19,800
Steve.

853
01:36:20,920 --> 01:36:23,000
No.

854
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:05,200
It's Ned Kelly. Christ
almighty, it's Ned Kelly.

855
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:37,400
Do you mind if I have this?

856
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:56,000
Hey! Look! It's Ned Kelly!

857
01:39:56,080 --> 01:39:58,840
Ned! Hey, Ned!

858
01:40:09,000 --> 01:40:11,400
Such is life.

859
01:40:11,480 --> 01:40:16,480
Despite petitions for a pardon that
bore a total of 32,000 signatures..

860
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:19,800
Ned Kelly was hanged on
11 th of November, 1880.

861
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:28,600
He was 25 years old.

862
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:08,800
