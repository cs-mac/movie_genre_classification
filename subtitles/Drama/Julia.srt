1
00:01:26,453 --> 00:01:29,980
<i>Old paint on canvas, as it ages...</i>

2
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,287
<i>sometimes becomes transparent.</i>

3
00:01:33,393 --> 00:01:35,987
<i>When that happens,</i>
<i>it is possible in some pictures...</i>

4
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,656
<i>to see the original lines.</i>

5
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:42,292
<i>A tree will show through a woman's dress.</i>

6
00:01:42,402 --> 00:01:45,701
<i>A child makes way for a dog.</i>

7
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:49,502
<i>A boat is no longer on an open sea.</i>

8
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,703
<i>That is called pentimento...</i>

9
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,042
<i>because the painter repented...</i>

10
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,673
<i>changed his mind.</i>

11
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:35,478
<i>I'm old now, and I wanna remember...</i>

12
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:38,148
<i>what was there for me once...</i>

13
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:40,726
<i>and what is there for me now.</i>

14
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:09,270
It's not working again, Dash.

15
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:11,646
It's falling apart again.

16
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,219
Put on your sweater.
Bring some whiskey.

17
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,413
I'll build a fire, and we'll start dinner.

18
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:18,513
Don't forget the smokes.

19
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,923
I'm not here to take orders. I want advice.

20
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:24,963
<i>You're a big-shot writer.</i>

21
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:29,558
<i> You're not a general,</i>
<i>Hammett, and I ain't the troops!</i>

22
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,381
If you really can't write,
maybe you should go find a job.

23
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:53,858
Be a waitress.

24
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,554
What about a fireman, eh?
You could be chief.

25
00:04:56,663 --> 00:05:00,155
It's not a bad idea, you know?
Little town somewhere...

26
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:03,133
find yourself a little fire station, a hat.

27
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:06,364
<i>- I'll be the mayor.</i>
- Why should you be the mayor?

28
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,531
<i>Well, someone has to appoint you if...</i>

29
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,543
I'm in trouble with my goddamn play,
and you don't care!

30
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,205
<i>Just because you stopped writing doesn't...</i>

31
00:05:39,205 --> 00:05:43,699
<i>Tell you what, Lilly.</i>
<i>I'll send you on a trip to Paris.</i>

32
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,176
<i>I don't wanna go to Paris.</i>

33
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,680
Why not? I hear it's a swell town.

34
00:05:49,782 --> 00:05:53,343
Finish the play there.
Have a little fun. Visit your friend Julia.

35
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:56,286
You know damn well Julia’s not in Paris.

36
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:59,324
<i>Well, wherever she is.</i>

37
00:05:59,425 --> 00:06:02,724
Go to Spain. There may be a civil war
in Spain. You'd help somebody win it.

38
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:06,822
- You're scrappy.
- I'm not scrappy. Don't call me scrappy.

39
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,924
You make me sound like
a neighborhood bulldog.

40
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,003
You <i>are</i> the neighborhood bulldog, Lilly!

41
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,164
'Cept you got some cockeyed dream
about bein' a cocker spaniel.

42
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:19,436
- I can't work here.
- Well, then don't work here.
Don't work anyplace.

43
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:22,571
It's not as if you've written
anything before, you know.

44
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:26,209
Nobody'll miss you.
It's a perfect time to change jobs.

45
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,083
You're the one who talked me
into being a writer, Dashiell.

46
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,820
You're the one who said,
"Stick with it, kid. You got talent, kid."

47
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,261
You soft-soaped me with all that crap!

48
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,301
- And now look at me.
- If you're gonna cry about it,
go stand on a rock.

49
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,530
Don't do it around me.

50
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:51,535
If you can't write here, go someplace else.

51
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:55,171
Give it up. Open a drugstore.

52
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,444
Be a coal miner.

53
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:01,452
Only just don't cry about it.

54
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:11,362
<i> I think I have</i>
<i>always known about my memory.</i>

55
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:16,458
<i>I know when the truth</i>
<i>is distorted by some drama or fantasy.</i>

56
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,534
<i>But I trust absolutely</i>
<i>what I remember about...</i>

57
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,542
<i>Julia.</i>

58
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,550
Happy New Year, Grandmother.

59
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:46,784
Happy New Year, Julia.

60
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,136
- Happy New Year, Grandfather.
- Hmm?

61
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:02,265
Why did we have sherbert
in the middle of the meal?

62
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,367
It clears the palate
between the fish and the meat.

63
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,341
- Who's that?
- It's my mother.

64
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:15,113
<i>- My God.</i>
<i>- She just got married again.</i>

65
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,951
<i>- Where does your mother live?</i>
- In Scotland.

66
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,787
- My mother owns a very fancy castle.
- Have you been there?

67
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,020
- Once.
- What's it like?

68
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,757
Full of fancy people with fancy titles.

69
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:29,198
- Who were they?
- I don't remember. They didn't interest me.

70
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:31,293
They're all very rich and famous.

71
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,770
They just said hello to me,
and I don't remember.

72
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:12,307
- Happy New Year, Julia.
- Happy New Year.

73
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:18,581
I am... Paris.

74
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:23,553
I am Paris, and I am a string of beads.

75
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:28,650
I am Paris,
and I am a string of beads on a hot dancer.

76
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,229
I am Paris,
and I am a string of beads on a hot dancer...

77
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,736
and a romantic Frenchman
comes into my room.

78
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,240
And he carries me
off into the dark Parisian night.

79
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,333
And takes me to his villa.

80
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,839
What happened?

81
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,546
- Oh, I'm in ecstasy!
- What happened?

82
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,590
You'll have to learn French.

83
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:06,260
<i>I am Paris.</i>

84
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:10,961
<i>I am Paris, and I am a string of beads.</i>

85
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,070
No, wait a minute. No.

86
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:22,546
I am Paris,
and I am a string of beads on a hot dancer.

87
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,912
I am Paris. I am a string
of beads on a hot dancer...

88
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,477
and outside it is Renoir and Degas.

89
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:33,786
I am Paris, and I am a string
of beads on a hot dancer...

90
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,953
- and outside it is...
<i>- Renoir.</i>

91
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:40,396
Renoir and Degas...

92
00:11:40,499 --> 00:11:44,595
and inside it is hard and hot.

93
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,434
I don't care.

94
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,203
I don't care.

95
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:57,244
- Happy New Year, Julia.
- Happy New Year, Lilly.

96
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,181
<i> I cannot say now</i>
<i>that I had ever used the words...</i>

97
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:07,691
<i>gentle or strong...</i>

98
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,660
<i>or delicate.</i>

99
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:13,027
<i>But I did think that night...</i>

100
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:16,295
<i>that it was the most beautiful face...</i>

101
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,371
<i>I had ever seen.</i>

102
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:57,208
Maybe I could do better work someplace else.

103
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,403
Dash?

104
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:03,175
If I were to go to Paris and work...

105
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:07,275
- Are you awake?
- Uh.

106
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:11,215
Dash, do I keep you from writing?

107
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:14,781
No. Sleeping, Lilly.
You keep me from sleeping.

108
00:13:24,837 --> 00:13:25,916
<i>But what about Paris? What about Rome?</i>

109
00:13:25,951 --> 00:13:26,995
<i>But what about Paris? What about Rome?</i>

110
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,768
<i>- You aren't listening!</i>
<i>- I</i> am <i>listening!</i>

111
00:14:55,594 --> 00:14:57,585
Please tell me what's the matter.

112
00:14:57,696 --> 00:15:00,324
I don't want to be here, not with them.

113
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:03,560
- I hate them.
- Why?

114
00:15:09,775 --> 00:15:12,209
They took me to see Cairo.

115
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:16,714
They told me how beautiful
Cairo would be, but it wasn't.

116
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:20,046
<i>I said to my grandfather,</i>
<i>"Look at those people. They're hungry.</i>

117
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:22,552
They're sick.
Why don't we do something?"

118
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:24,680
And he said, "Don't look at them."

119
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,781
I said, "But they're sick."

120
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:30,225
He said, "I didn't make them sick."

121
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,695
What about Paris?
What about Rome?

122
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:35,392
- You aren't listening!
- I <i>am</i> listening!

123
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,398
Where my mother lives,
the servants live under the ground...

124
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:44,875
18 people in three rooms,
no windows, one bathroom.

125
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:49,141
It's wrong. It's wrong, Lilly.

126
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:50,482
<i>Do you understand?</i>

127
00:15:50,517 --> 00:15:51,716
<i>Do you understand?</i>

128
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,814
<i>I heard from Oxford, from medical school.</i>

129
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:01,017
<i>- I was accepted!</i>
<i>- When will you go?</i>

130
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,720
<i>At the end of the summer!</i>

131
00:16:07,533 --> 00:16:10,627
<i>All ashore that's going ashore.</i>
You'd better go.

132
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:29,083
When are we gonna see each other again?

133
00:16:29,188 --> 00:16:31,156
It'll be so long.

134
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:37,924
Think of it this way... when we do
we'll have everything to talk about.

135
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:40,521
<i>- All ashore that's going ashore!</i>
- Please write me.

136
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,930
You know I will.

137
00:16:44,536 --> 00:16:47,562
Work hard. Take chances.

138
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,336
<i>Be very bold. Do you hear me?</i>

139
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:54,139
<i>- All ashore that's going ashore!</i>
- Good-bye.

140
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:56,214
<i>Good-bye.</i>

141
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,753
<i> I wasn't to see her</i>
<i>again for a very long time...</i>

142
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:05,312
<i>until I went to visit her at Oxford.</i>

143
00:17:11,597 --> 00:17:14,657
<i>There are women who reach</i>
<i>a perfect time of life...</i>

144
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:18,430
<i>when the face will never again be as good...</i>

145
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:22,303
<i>the body never as graceful or powerful.</i>

146
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,077
<i>It had happened that year to Julia.</i>

147
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,741
- Do you have lots of friends?
- Not many.

148
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,913
- Do you get to the theater?
- No, there isn't time.

149
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,685
But we always went to the theater.

150
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,627
When you write your play, then I'll go again.

151
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,530
- How is your writing?
- Oh, I'm still at the publishing house.

152
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,102
I wish I could write full-time.

153
00:17:51,203 --> 00:17:55,139
- Do you have a beau?
- No. Do you?

154
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,936
Well, I think maybe I found somebody.

155
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,171
- And you?
- I did, but it didn't work out.

156
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,215
- What are you reading now?
- Darwin, Engels...

157
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:07,945
Hegel, Einstein.

158
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,511
- Do you understand Einstein?
- Sure.

159
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:33,669
- Will you come home next summer?
- No, I'm going to Vienna.

160
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,838
I'll finish my medical studies there...

161
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,315
and then I'll apply to study
with Professor Freud.

162
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:41,852
Can you do that?
I mean, I know you can do that...

163
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,149
- but Jesus.
- I think so. There's a chance.

164
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,225
I think he will accept me.
Lilly, you have to come to Vienna.

165
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,920
Then you'll know what to write about.

166
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:54,021
People are coming alive there... working
people who've never had a chance before.

167
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,863
They've built their own
part of the city in Floridsdorf.

168
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:01,099
They've got their own orchestra.
The newspaper's the best in Vienna.

169
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:05,074
Lilly, finally there's
some real hope in the world.

170
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:08,237
Do you understand?

171
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:10,315
Yes, of course.

172
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,187
<i>But I didn't understand.</i>

173
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:20,384
<i>Not fully. Who of us did?</i>

174
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:26,397
<i>She wrote me from time to time. She went on</i>
<i>to study medicine at the university in Vienna.</i>

175
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:31,128
<i>And as the years went on,</i>
<i>she wrote angrily of the threat of fascism...</i>

176
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:35,764
<i>and of the Nazis, of Mussolini</i>
<i>and Adolf Hitler...</i>

177
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:39,708
<i>and of the holocaust</i>
<i>that was on the way.</i>

178
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:44,271
<i>She couldn't understand why the world</i>
<i>refused to see what was coming.</i>

179
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:53,858
<i>I decided to accept Hammett's offer...</i>

180
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,486
<i>to see if I could do</i>
<i>better work away from home.</i>

181
00:19:57,596 --> 00:20:01,225
<i>I went back to Europe, to Paris.</i>

182
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:13,739
<i>Julia? It's Lillian.</i>

183
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:19,780
Is that you? It doesn't sound like you.

184
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:23,685
I can't believe it. It's been so long.

185
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:28,351
Didn't you get my messages?
I've been trying to get you for weeks.

186
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,928
I'm fine. I'm in Paris.

187
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:33,190
When can I see you?

188
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:38,828
I'm finishing my play.
Didn't you get my letter?

189
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,373
Are you okay?

190
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,671
What's difficult?

191
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:48,541
H-Hello.

192
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,616
Well, I'll... I'll come to Vienna.

193
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,185
Why not?

194
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,550
Well, how... Well, how about halfway?

195
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:59,715
I'll meet you halfway.

196
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:04,057
Yes. Hotel Jacob.
I won't leave until I hear from you.

197
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:06,357
Are you all right?

198
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,456
Hello!

199
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:48,296
<i>Dear Dash,</i>
<i>I try to concentrate on my play...</i>

200
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,800
<i>but I... I feel sick.</i>

201
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:55,271
<i>There's no reason for my nausea</i>
<i>other than fright.</i>

202
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:58,036
<i>There's something very evil here, Dash.</i>

203
00:22:58,143 --> 00:23:02,045
<i>Something frightening and evil,</i>
<i>and I think it will affect all our lives.</i>

204
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:06,208
<i>- And it's not only in Paris.</i>
- Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

205
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:08,286
<i>What's gonna happen to Julia?</i>

206
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,550
<i>She's still studying in Vienna.</i>

207
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:21,724
<i>Ein, zwei, drei!</i>

208
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,407
No! They've got our friend!

209
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,879
No! Look at that!

210
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,438
Get out! Get out!

211
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,246
You... You bastards!

212
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:52,949
Get out!

213
00:24:54,526 --> 00:24:57,222
Julia.

214
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,599
<i>Telephone.</i>

215
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:42,901
<i>Mademoiselle, telephone!</i>

216
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:45,135
<i>They call from Vienna!</i>

217
00:25:45,243 --> 00:25:47,234
What happened?

218
00:25:47,345 --> 00:25:50,007
Oh, my God! How serious is it?

219
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:56,578
Of course I'm coming!
Please, tell her... Tell her I'm coming!

220
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,883
Yes, where do I go?

221
00:28:03,648 --> 00:28:05,616
Fräulein.

222
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,594
Your <i>Freundin.</i>

223
00:28:40,251 --> 00:28:42,913
What?

224
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:45,046
<i>Ja?</i>

225
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,292
Fräulein!

226
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,461
Hotel Imperial.

227
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,769
<i>- A reservation at the Hotel Imperial?</i>

228
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:05,308
<i>- Ja.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

229
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,488
So good to have you with us, Fräulein.

230
00:29:21,726 --> 00:29:24,661
- Who made the reservation?
- Oh, yes, uh...

231
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,323
Herr Von Fritsch, Fräulein Hellman.

232
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,492
He wants me to tell you
that everything is arranged...

233
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:33,332
<i>- and you will be comfortable and well.</i>
- Is, uh...

234
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,999
- Herr Von Fritsch in this hotel?
<i>- No, Fräulein. He's not.</i>

235
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,770
Well, how can I reach
this Mr. Herr Von Fritsch?

236
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,109
I do not know, Fräulein.
He came and went very quickly.

237
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,354
She's resting from the operation.

238
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,932
- Will you come tomorrow, please?
<i>- What operation?</i>

239
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,660
- Excuse me. What operation?
- She's resting.

240
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:09,069
- I don't understand what you mean.
- Come tomorrow, please.

241
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,699
- What operation?
- Come back tomorrow.

242
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,246
No, I will not come back tomorrow!
I will wait right here!

243
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,795
<i>Fräulein.</i>

244
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:19,734
I-I don't know what you mean.

245
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,173
I don't know what you mean.

246
00:33:21,432 --> 00:33:24,492
- Where is she?
- Treatment.

247
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,730
- What's happened?
- Treatment.

248
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,250
<i>Psst. Fräulein!</i>

249
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:48,349
<i>Danke.</i>

250
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:01,203
<i>Go back to Paris fast.</i>

251
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:03,398
<i>Leave your address at the hotel.</i>

252
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:05,567
<i>They will take me now to another place.</i>

253
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,839
<i>Love, Julia.</i>

254
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:12,143
<i> I stayed in Europe</i>
<i>for months trying to find her...</i>

255
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:15,310
<i>waiting for some word from her.</i>

256
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,411
<i>But there was no sign.</i>

257
00:34:17,522 --> 00:34:22,152
Please speak more slowly.
I cannot understand you.

258
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,388
Wa... Wait. <i>Attendez un instant.</i>

259
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:29,455
- Do you speak German? Uh, <i>parlez Deutsch?</i>
- Ah, no.

260
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,730
Excuse me, madam, but I speak German.

261
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:42,102
- They say she was never there, madam.
- They have to have her name!

262
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:45,114
Tell them I saw her. I was there.

263
00:34:53,357 --> 00:34:55,951
No, madam. She was never in that hospital.

264
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:58,790
But I saw her!
They have to know where she went.

265
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,430
<i>Madame, they do not even know the name.</i>

266
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,965
<i>Madame, they do not even know the name.</i>

267
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:09,199
<i> I gave up trying</i>
<i>to write the play and went back home.</i>

268
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:13,641
<i>Not long after that, I received a letter...</i>

269
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:16,212
<i>postmarked "Vienna."</i>

270
00:35:16,314 --> 00:35:20,512
<i>I could write her</i>
<i>in care of a post office box in London.</i>

271
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,483
<i>She said not to worry and that one day...</i>

272
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:24,349
<i>She said not to worry and that one day...</i>

273
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:28,050
<i>she knew we would see each other again.</i>

274
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:30,992
<i>I tried to finish my play.</i>

275
00:35:31,095 --> 00:35:33,461
It's gonna snow, Dash.

276
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,557
Dash?

277
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:39,153
Mmm.

278
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,524
You wanted to be a serious writer.

279
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,464
That's what I liked.
That's what we worked for.

280
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:53,264
I don't know what happened,
but you'd better tear that up.

281
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:58,940
Not that it's bad.
It's just not good enough.

282
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,375
Not for you.

283
00:40:31,295 --> 00:40:34,890
It's the best play anyone's written
in a long time.

284
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,867
Are you sure?

285
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:47,170
I'm positive.

286
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,585
But are you sure?

287
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,613
Congratulations, Miss Hellman.

288
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:49,902
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

289
00:41:54,945 --> 00:41:58,881
Lillian, it was beautiful.

290
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,749
This is Max.
I made him come down and see it.

291
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:05,947
<i>Bravo! Bravo!</i>

292
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,928
- That was a play to be proud of.
- Wonderful.

293
00:42:18,168 --> 00:42:20,261
Dash?

294
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,431
I hope I woke you up from a sound sleep.

295
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,942
Wanna hear the good news?

296
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,808
They think I'm wonderful.

297
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,509
I'm the toast of the town.

298
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:36,279
Everybody came.

299
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,982
And you had to go to Hollywood.

300
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,320
Of course I'm drunk.

301
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:46,453
Been drunk for two days. How the hell
do you think I got through this night?

302
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:50,963
Who's in bed with you, Dash?

303
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:54,435
No, I won't send you the reviews!

304
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:56,972
Ye... But... Dash.

305
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:01,170
The second act was fine!
You were right about everything.

306
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,940
But you know that.

307
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,175
When are you coming home?

308
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,852
<i> Dear Julia, I sent you a copy</i>
<i>of my play. Did you ever get it?</i>

309
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,518
<i>It opened on Broadway,</i>
<i>just as we always pretended it would.</i>

310
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,652
<i>They liked it.</i>

311
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,094
<i>I only wish you'd been there.</i>

312
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,564
<i>Maybe I wouldn't have had to get so drunk.</i>

313
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:28,237
<i>I haven't heard from you in such a long time.</i>

314
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,841
Royalties, Hammett!

315
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:42,382
More royalties!

316
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,854
- I could buy a sable coat.
- If that's what you want.

317
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,592
I have a right to have a sable coat.

318
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,537
Maybe I ought to give my money to Roosevelt.

319
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,404
You could do that too.

320
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:11,444
I'd look swell in a sable coat.

321
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:20,988
- Dash?
- Hmm?

322
00:44:21,091 --> 00:44:23,821
I like being famous.

323
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,391
You know what happens
when I go shopping for groceries now?

324
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,732
I'm famous.

325
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:37,068
I buy mayonnaise and I'm famous.

326
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,405
Get letters from people in Idaho.

327
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,775
I don't even know where Idaho is.

328
00:44:44,948 --> 00:44:48,611
- You're not listening to me.
- I'm listening to you, Lilly.

329
00:44:52,723 --> 00:44:56,318
Dash, I don't want you to think
I just care about sable coats.

330
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,664
I know that, Lilly.

331
00:45:04,735 --> 00:45:09,263
You've been famous a long time,
Dash, and it never seems to bother you.

332
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,740
<i>Ohh! Aargh!</i>

333
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,108
This is a dopey conversation!

334
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,445
It's only fame, Lilly.

335
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,643
Just a paint job.

336
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,913
If you want a sable coat, buy one.

337
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:28,924
Just remember, it doesn't have
anything to do with writing.

338
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,291
It's only a sable coat and doesn't
have anything to do with writing.

339
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,133
Well, you'll never
find anybody who fishes better than I do.

340
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,831
No. Never. Not as long as I live.

341
00:45:49,346 --> 00:45:51,780
Why won't you come to Russia
with me, Dash?

342
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:53,907
I don't wanna go to Russia.

343
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,352
Why not?
Don't you wanna see the Russian theater?

344
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:03,051
I don't give a damn
about the Russian theater.

345
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,185
Oh, come on.

346
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,695
Come with me to Russia, Dash.

347
00:46:07,798 --> 00:46:10,164
We could stay in Paris for a while first.

348
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,258
See the Eiffel Tower.

349
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:15,705
Come on.

350
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:29,642
Now you've been invited to Moscow?

351
00:46:29,753 --> 00:46:32,517
What is that, some sort of political thing?

352
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,353
Not exactly. No, Anne Marie, it's, uh...

353
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,723
It's only a theater festival.

354
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,797
Oh, did you know
about the McPhee boy, the little one?

355
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:45,164
He was killed in Spain. Imagine
having your brother die a Communist.

356
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:49,137
I'm sorry he lost his life,
but I wonder why they rush over there.

357
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,642
By the way, I tried to see Julia
in Vienna, but she wouldn't see me.

358
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:56,042
<i>She's leading a strange life,</i>
<i>pretending not to be rich...</i>

359
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:59,741
<i>doing something called anti...</i>
<i>uh, antifascist work.</i>

360
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,751
<i>Didn't she drop out of medical school?</i>

361
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,289
- Yes.
<i>- Do you ever hear from her?</i>

362
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,056
Well, I'm glad you had time to see me.

363
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,891
You look so very slim, Lillian.

364
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,261
Thank you, Anne Marie.

365
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:19,494
Imagine, Russia. My God, of all places.

366
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:45,155
Where is he now? He keeps moving.

367
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:47,196
<i>By the post.</i>

368
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:50,691
He just stands there! He doesn't wave.

369
00:47:50,801 --> 00:47:54,635
Let him stand there if he wants to.
We're goin' to Paris, Lilly!

370
00:47:54,738 --> 00:47:57,298
Where's the wine steward?

371
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:11,283
- He's waving. Look.
<i>- By God!</i>

372
00:48:11,388 --> 00:48:13,515
<i>He's tilting his hat!</i>

373
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,163
<i>Does Julia live there, or doesn't she?</i>

374
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,898
<i>Well, would you give her a message?</i>

375
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,906
Message! Oh!

376
00:48:31,008 --> 00:48:33,033
Does anybody there speak better English?

377
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,475
<i>Sprechen</i> better English?

378
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:39,948
No. No. I want somebody better than you.

379
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:43,781
All right. Yes. All right.
Would you please tell her Lillian...

380
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,755
Lillian is in Paris at the Hotel Meurice.

381
00:48:47,858 --> 00:48:50,258
- I'll be here for two weeks.
<i>- Lillian!</i>

382
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,887
Then I'm going to... Just a second, Alan!

383
00:48:53,997 --> 00:48:57,956
I'm going to Moscow,
and I can come to Vienna to see her.

384
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,093
Hello.

385
00:49:00,203 --> 00:49:03,866
Hello. Oh, uh... Just a...

386
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,465
Alan, just a minute!

387
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:08,567
God, why don't you break
the damn door down?

388
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,807
It's 20 after 8:00, and we're due
at the Murphys' for cocktails at 8:30.

389
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,906
- Oy vey.
- Hold on. You missed a button. Here.

390
00:49:14,017 --> 00:49:17,714
- Alan.
- Well, now, who were you talking to?

391
00:49:17,821 --> 00:49:19,880
- Dottie, would you button up this damn thing?
- Sure, darling.

392
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:23,118
We'll be half an hour late.
Supposed to have supper at the Rothschilds'.

393
00:49:23,226 --> 00:49:25,251
Would you tell him
to settle down, for God's sake?

394
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:27,330
He's afraid we're gonna miss Hemingway.

395
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,797
- Who were you talking to on the phone?
- Hemingway? Hemingway?

396
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,891
Yeah, he's coming up from Spain.

397
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,233
Say, you have an invitation
to Louise de Vilmorin's.

398
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:38,570
Dottie, did we get an invitation
to Louise de Vilmorin's?

399
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:42,111
- Would you tell him to get
out of my things, Dottie?
- Get out of her things, Alan.

400
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:46,706
- Hemingway, huh?
- Yes. Hemingway and Cocteau
in his red necktie...

401
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:51,277
<i>- and the crème de la crème.</i>
- Way down deep he's very superficial.

402
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,515
Oh.

403
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:00,521
Oh, my. I forgot to turn in my key again.

404
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:03,593
- Will you never stop doing that?
- I always forget.

405
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,661
- You go up.
- Huh?

406
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:09,220
You go ahead.
I'm gonna see if there's any messages.

407
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,328
<i>Bonsoir.</i> Or <i>bonjour.</i>

408
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:19,967
- Good morning, Madame.
- Hellman, <i>deux vingt-huit.</i>

409
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,011
<i>Merci... beaucoup.</i>

410
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,273
Don't overdo it, darling.

411
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:26,679
<i>- Bonjour, garçon.</i>

412
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:31,685
- Oh, <i>merci.</i>
- You are welcome, Madame.

413
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:39,761
- Madame Hellman?
- Yes?

414
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:42,058
I've come to talk to you about the tickets...

415
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:44,656
and your travel plans.

416
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,259
What?

417
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:50,305
Miss Julia has asked me to see you.

418
00:51:50,407 --> 00:51:52,637
I have your travel folders.

419
00:51:52,742 --> 00:51:56,678
What... What's the trouble?
Has something happened to Julia?

420
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,945
Do you think I could have
an egg, a hot milk and a roll?

421
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:04,782
<i>I could not pay for it, however.</i>

422
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,947
Um, yes.

423
00:52:15,432 --> 00:52:17,491
Uh, hello.

424
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:21,002
Yes. We'd like just some breakfast, please.

425
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:23,163
Thank you.

426
00:52:25,075 --> 00:52:27,134
Thank you very much.

427
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:42,757
<i>This is my friend, Johann.</i>

428
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:47,660
<i>He will tell you what I need,</i>
<i>but I tell you don't push yourself.</i>

429
00:52:47,764 --> 00:52:51,200
<i>If you can't, you can't. No dishonor.</i>

430
00:52:51,301 --> 00:52:53,360
<i>Love, Julia.</i>

431
00:53:18,395 --> 00:53:20,420
Oh, I'm sorry.

432
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:25,727
I'm sorry I could not pay for myself.

433
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,860
But someday perhaps.

434
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,633
Yes. Perhaps. I'm sure. Someday.

435
00:53:32,475 --> 00:53:35,103
Thank you for the fine breakfast.

436
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,477
Could we walk in the Tuileries now?

437
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,916
Yes. Waiter.

438
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:09,040
I cannot take long.
Time is too short, and there is much to do.

439
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,705
So if I'm not cordial, you will understand.

440
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,783
Yes. Of course.

441
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,443
You're very cordial.
I think you're very cordial.

442
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:19,613
You're going to Moscow by way of Vienna.

443
00:54:19,723 --> 00:54:23,181
- Yes.
- We would like to change your travel plans.

444
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:25,955
We would like you to travel by way of Berlin.

445
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:28,428
Why?

446
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:30,522
You would have to leave immediately.

447
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:32,693
You would need a German visa.

448
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:37,967
You would stay a short time in Berlin
and then change trains there to Moscow.

449
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,599
I'm sorry, but you're not being clear.

450
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:47,442
We would like you to carry for us $50,000.

451
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,609
We think you're safe...

452
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:53,416
but we cannot assure you of this.

453
00:54:53,523 --> 00:54:57,653
The money is Julia's money. With it
we can bribe out already many in prison...

454
00:54:57,761 --> 00:55:00,457
and many who soon will be.

455
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:14,943
I better explain. We are small group
who work against Hitler.

456
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,242
We are of no common belief or religion.

457
00:55:18,348 --> 00:55:20,908
The people who you will meet for the money...

458
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,815
if your consent is given,
were some small publishers.

459
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,252
We are Catholic, Communist... many beliefs.

460
00:55:26,356 --> 00:55:29,189
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yes. Yes.

461
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,817
We realize you are not the best person...

462
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:34,590
for this kind of mission because you’re Jewish.

463
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,657
But unfortunately
there's no one else we can ask.

464
00:55:38,768 --> 00:55:42,465
Julia said I must remind you for her...

465
00:55:42,572 --> 00:55:44,631
that you're afraid of being afraid...

466
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:47,972
and so you will do
what sometimes you cannot do.

467
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,842
That could be dangerous to you... and to us.

468
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:55,008
So, p-please, try not to be heroic.

469
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:57,746
I assure you,
I would never try to be heroic.

470
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,549
Please, could we get a drink?

471
00:56:02,659 --> 00:56:06,459
No. I'm sorry. Sorry. The time is too short.

472
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:09,361
So, will you help us?

473
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:16,035
I, uh...

474
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:20,337
I need a few hours... to think it through.
I need to think it through.

475
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:24,470
It is best not to be
too prepared for matters of this kind.

476
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:29,678
Yes, I know that, but I... I need to think it
over for a while. Julia would want it that way.

477
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:33,847
There is a train at 6:30 this evening...

478
00:56:33,957 --> 00:56:36,653
to Berlin from the Gare du Nord.

479
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:41,094
<i>I will be there. Gate number five.</i>

480
00:56:41,197 --> 00:56:44,223
<i>If you agree to carry the money for us...</i>

481
00:56:44,334 --> 00:56:46,598
<i>you will s-say hello to me.</i>

482
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:50,002
<i>If you decide it's not right for you...</i>

483
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:54,202
<i>No, I haven't decided that. I just need...</i>

484
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:56,904
I need time to think it over.

485
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,277
- If you decide that it is not right for you...
- For a while.

486
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:01,373
Then pass me by.

487
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,918
Otherwise, you will simply say hello...

488
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:06,250
and then I will tell you what is necessary.

489
00:57:06,356 --> 00:57:08,916
Hello? I just say hello?

490
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,516
Yes. Just hello.

491
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:13,653
Where will you be?

492
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,754
Don't worry. I will find you.

493
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,857
But please, Madame...

494
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:21,937
if you cannot do it, do not do it.

495
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,302
Please stop saying that.

496
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,475
Thank you... for the tour.

497
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,116
Thank you for the wonderful morning.

498
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:24,492
<i> Lilly, you don't have</i>
<i>to come this way. Go down under.</i>

499
00:58:24,601 --> 00:58:26,660
<i>Wade across.</i>

500
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,567
<i>Lilly, you don't have to come this way.</i>

501
00:58:59,669 --> 00:59:02,399
Go down under. Wade across.

502
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,606
<i>Just hold tight.</i>

503
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,947
Pull yourself.

504
00:59:53,056 --> 00:59:55,115
I can't.

505
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,457
Easy.

506
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,718
I'm sorry.

507
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:35,320
It's all right. You'll do it next time.

508
01:00:40,269 --> 01:00:42,328
<i>Why'd you change your plans?</i>

509
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:46,562
It was just an impulse. I...
I thought it would be pleasant to see Berlin.

510
01:00:46,672 --> 01:00:49,573
I thought I'd be able to stay
more than a few hours.

511
01:00:49,675 --> 01:00:54,977
You are going to Moscow. So regulations
permit only that you will have a transit visa.

512
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:57,106
Why is that?

513
01:01:07,293 --> 01:01:09,261
There you are.

514
01:01:09,362 --> 01:01:12,160
- Your train tickets, Madame.
- Thank you very much.

515
01:01:12,264 --> 01:01:15,529
- And where is my trunk?
- It's on the way to the station, Madame.

516
01:01:15,635 --> 01:01:17,603
It will be put on the train.

517
01:01:19,338 --> 01:01:22,034
- Did... Did the Campbells get my message?
- Yes, Madame.

518
01:01:22,141 --> 01:01:24,371
- Thank you very much. Here.
- Thank you very much.

519
01:01:24,477 --> 01:01:26,502
<i>Have a good trip, Madame Hellman.</i>

520
01:01:26,612 --> 01:01:28,637
Thank you.

521
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:36,853
Yes, yes. Here, here.

522
01:01:45,297 --> 01:01:47,265
Do you think you can be invisible?

523
01:01:47,366 --> 01:01:50,597
What does this mean, you're leaving us,
you'll find us again after Moscow?

524
01:01:50,703 --> 01:01:52,933
- I'm in a hurry. I can't explain.
- Lilly, what's wrong?

525
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,566
Nothing's wrong. I've changed my plans.
I've had enough partying, and I'm gonna leave.

526
01:01:56,676 --> 01:01:59,144
- It's not like you to be so mysterious.
- I'm late. I gotta go.

527
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:01,805
- Well, we'll see you to the station.
- No, Alan! No!

528
01:02:01,914 --> 01:02:04,212
I don't need you. I'll call you from Moscow.

529
01:02:04,316 --> 01:02:06,284
Alan, why are you doing this?

530
01:02:06,385 --> 01:02:10,014
Because our friend Lilly's gone berserk.
What am I supposed to do?

531
01:02:20,066 --> 01:02:22,364
Alan, please.

532
01:02:22,468 --> 01:02:24,766
- What gate?
- It's Gate 5.

533
01:02:24,870 --> 01:02:26,895
Where's your ticket? Let me have your ticket.

534
01:02:27,006 --> 01:02:29,839
- You don't need to come in with me.
- Let me have your ticket.

535
01:02:29,942 --> 01:02:32,103
Oh, God. I'm late already.
I'm gonna miss my train.

536
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:34,179
Attention. Attention.

537
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,113
Quai numéro 5. Départ imminent...

538
01:02:37,216 --> 01:02:41,243
du Nord-Express
à destination de Moscou via Berlin.

539
01:02:41,353 --> 01:02:45,153
By way of Berlin?
Why are you going by way of Berlin?

540
01:02:45,257 --> 01:02:48,351
I thought you wanted to go to Vienna
to see your friend Julia.

541
01:02:48,461 --> 01:02:50,452
- I-I never heard from her.
- Darling...

542
01:02:50,563 --> 01:02:52,588
- Say good-bye to me here.
- Now, Lillian...

543
01:02:52,698 --> 01:02:55,098
<i>you know what they do to Jews in Germany.</i>

544
01:02:59,038 --> 01:03:02,997
<i> Say, isn't that the man</i>
<i>I saw you with in the Tuileries today?</i>

545
01:03:03,109 --> 01:03:05,236
Is he a friend of yours or something?

546
01:03:07,313 --> 01:03:09,781
Mr. Johann. M-Mr. Johann.

547
01:03:09,882 --> 01:03:12,578
No, please! Don't go away.

548
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:18,654
I just wanted to say hello
to you, Mr. Johann. Hello.

549
01:03:18,758 --> 01:03:21,625
These are friends of mine.

550
01:03:21,727 --> 01:03:24,127
This gentleman says
he saw us today in the gardens.

551
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:27,199
Now he's gonna ask me who you are,
and he's gonna say he didn't know...

552
01:03:27,299 --> 01:03:30,359
we knew each other so well that you
would come say good-bye to me here.

553
01:03:30,469 --> 01:03:32,835
I wish I could say that it was true, but, uh...

554
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:36,567
I came here to seek for my nephew
who is en route to Poland.

555
01:03:36,675 --> 01:03:40,372
He's not in his coach.
He's late. This is his habit.

556
01:03:40,479 --> 01:03:43,710
His name is Walter Franz.
Coach 4, second class.

557
01:03:43,816 --> 01:03:48,378
<i>Since I could not find him, I would be</i>
<i>most grateful if you could say to him I came.</i>

558
01:03:48,487 --> 01:03:52,014
- What... What is his name?
- Walter Franz.

559
01:03:52,124 --> 01:03:54,422
Coach 4, second class.

560
01:03:54,527 --> 01:03:57,655
I'm most glad that I had this chance
to say hello to you.

561
01:03:57,763 --> 01:04:01,563
Oh, yes indeed, Mr. Johann.
Hello to you. Hello, Mr. Johann.

562
01:04:03,269 --> 01:04:07,069
What funny talk.
You're talking like a foreigner.

563
01:04:07,173 --> 01:04:11,041
I'm sorry, Alan. I'm sorry I don't talk
as good as you do in Virginia.

564
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:14,112
I've gotta say good-bye.

565
01:04:28,561 --> 01:04:31,189
<i>La monnaie est là.</i>

566
01:04:31,297 --> 01:04:34,266
<i>La monnaie est là.</i>

567
01:05:50,643 --> 01:05:53,510
Madame Hellman.

568
01:05:53,612 --> 01:05:58,675
I am Walter Franz. Nephew.
Car 4, second class.

569
01:05:58,784 --> 01:06:02,845
<i>This is your birthday present from Miss Julia.</i>

570
01:07:37,683 --> 01:07:41,210
<i>Open this box, and wear the hat.</i>

571
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:47,054
<i>When you reach the border,</i>
<i>leave the candy box on the seat. Julia.</i>

572
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:14,409
This is Compartment "F."

573
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,579
Do you not want "F"?

574
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,917
Yes, but I... I was...
I'm going to the washroom.

575
01:08:22,027 --> 01:08:24,461
Um...

576
01:08:24,563 --> 01:08:27,430
I guess I won't go to the washroom.

577
01:08:27,533 --> 01:08:29,558
Excuse me.

578
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:47,783
<i>- Ja.</i>

579
01:08:47,886 --> 01:08:49,979
- May I turn off the light?
- Yes.

580
01:08:50,089 --> 01:08:52,114
Thank you.

581
01:09:58,123 --> 01:10:00,921
Nice coat.

582
01:10:01,026 --> 01:10:04,427
Oh, yes. My coat is... is nice. Thank you.

583
01:10:04,530 --> 01:10:07,055
Warm. What fur it is?

584
01:10:07,166 --> 01:10:09,225
It's sealskin.

585
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:11,427
Yes. It's... It's warm.

586
01:10:11,537 --> 01:10:14,529
Your hat is also fur?

587
01:10:17,676 --> 01:10:20,372
I don't know.

588
01:10:20,479 --> 01:10:22,504
I'll look.

589
01:10:26,418 --> 01:10:28,784
- Yes.
- Ah.

590
01:10:28,887 --> 01:10:32,050
<i>Nice with coat. You would put on?</i>

591
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:39,998
You would put on.

592
01:10:40,098 --> 01:10:42,464
Yes.

593
01:10:42,568 --> 01:10:44,627
Yes, I will.

594
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:54,577
- Ah, yes. Nice.
- Nice. Very nice.

595
01:10:54,680 --> 01:10:57,205
- It's pretty.
- Yes.

596
01:10:59,017 --> 01:11:02,282
Thank you. I think I'll keep it on.

597
01:11:02,387 --> 01:11:06,153
<i>Dîner, premier service.</i>

598
01:11:06,258 --> 01:11:08,317
<i>Le diner, premier service.</i>

599
01:11:11,964 --> 01:11:13,989
<i>- Kommen sie mit?</i>
<i>- Danke. Nein.</i>

600
01:11:14,099 --> 01:11:17,091
I go to eat now. You would like dinner?

601
01:11:17,202 --> 01:11:19,466
But I... I don't know when
we cross the border.

602
01:11:19,571 --> 01:11:24,508
Border? We do not stop for the border
until morning. There is much time now.

603
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:29,138
<i>Do not worry about your things.</i>
<i>I stay here.</i>

604
01:11:29,248 --> 01:11:33,582
I eat here. It's too much money
to pay for food on train.

605
01:11:47,266 --> 01:11:50,201
I think the consommé is the best.

606
01:11:50,302 --> 01:11:52,702
Yes. Fine. Consommé. Thank you.

607
01:12:02,547 --> 01:12:05,880
<i>You see, I must have hot food for the lungs.</i>

608
01:12:05,984 --> 01:12:10,148
I study in Paris, and I get ill, you see?

609
01:12:10,255 --> 01:12:13,349
I am at the university. I am not well.

610
01:12:13,458 --> 01:12:17,155
I was at a concert one night,
and sudden I cannot breathe, you see?

611
01:12:17,262 --> 01:12:19,560
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

612
01:12:19,665 --> 01:12:21,724
<i>J... Je malade.</i>

613
01:13:26,131 --> 01:13:28,156
Something wrong?

614
01:13:29,901 --> 01:13:32,927
No. I...

615
01:13:33,038 --> 01:13:35,871
I'm just not hungry.

616
01:13:44,916 --> 01:13:47,612
Like some tea?

617
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:49,778
No, thank you.

618
01:14:29,394 --> 01:14:31,521
<i>"When as in silks my Julia goes...</i>

619
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:37,159
<i>"then, then methinks how sweetly</i>
<i>flows the liquefaction of her clothes.</i>

620
01:14:38,303 --> 01:14:40,771

621
01:14:40,872 --> 01:14:44,035
"that brave vibration each way free...

01:14:44,142 --> 01:14:48,203
oh, how that glittering taketh me."

623
01:14:52,250 --> 01:14:54,684
That's his tribute to me.

624
01:14:58,924 --> 01:15:01,017
I love you, Julia.

625

Douane française.
Vous n'avez rien à déclarer?

626
01:15:30,989 --> 01:15:34,220
It comes now, the border.
We'll be in Germany soon.

627

<i>Douane française.</i>

<i>Passeport, s'il vous plaît.</i>

Douane française.
Vous n'avez rien à déclarer?

631
01:15:55,881 --> 01:15:57,940
Merci.

632
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:39,687
You need your coat and hat.
It is very windy.

633
01:16:49,234 --> 01:16:51,566
You don't need the box.

634
01:16:54,339 --> 01:16:56,705
You forgot your hat. It's cold.

635
01:16:58,043 --> 01:17:00,068
Thank you.

636
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:10,672
If you have a temporary visa,
it could take more time than others.

637
01:18:10,782 --> 01:18:13,478
It is nothing. Do not worry.

638
01:18:13,585 --> 01:18:15,746
Nächste.

639
01:18:23,028 --> 01:18:25,656
Nächste.

640
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:42,473
<i>- Rauchen verboten.</i>
- No?

641
01:18:42,580 --> 01:18:44,571
Das rauchen ist verboten.

642
01:18:47,786 --> 01:18:50,118
<i>Nächste.</i>

643
01:18:50,221 --> 01:18:52,587
<i>- Danke schön.</i>
<i>- Nächste.</i>

644
01:19:03,635 --> 01:19:07,264
- Transit visa.
- Yes.

645
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:11,641
<i>- Hellman.</i>
- Yes.

646
01:19:15,046 --> 01:19:17,947
You are traveling to Moscow.
Why have you stopped in Berlin?

647
01:19:20,185 --> 01:19:22,779
Friends. To see friends. And to see it.

648
01:19:22,887 --> 01:19:24,946
I've never been in Berlin.

649
01:19:25,056 --> 01:19:27,149
<i>- Not business?</i>
- Oh, no.

650
01:19:29,394 --> 01:19:32,386
You cannot see much of Berlin
in a few hours.

651
01:19:33,832 --> 01:19:35,800
<i>What is your occupation?</i>

652
01:19:35,900 --> 01:19:38,164
<i>I'm a writer.</i>

653
01:19:38,269 --> 01:19:40,328
- Oh, a writer.
- Yes.

654
01:19:40,438 --> 01:19:44,340
<i>- So you would write of Berlin?</i>
- Oh, no. I wouldn't.

655
01:19:46,678 --> 01:19:49,238
Perhaps your impressions
you would write.

656
01:19:49,347 --> 01:19:52,373
My impressions.
Yes, I would write of my impressions.

657
01:20:04,729 --> 01:20:06,924
<i>All right.</i>

658
01:20:07,031 --> 01:20:09,659
Thank you very much. <i>Nächste.</i>

659
01:20:34,993 --> 01:20:37,291
<i>Heil Hitler.</i>

660
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:59,242
- The customs... they take
a long time with the luggage.
- Hmm.

661
01:21:04,589 --> 01:21:08,184
- What are you doing?
- Thank you. I would like a piece of chocolate.

662
01:21:08,293 --> 01:21:11,592
Pl-Please don't do that.
I'm bringing it to a friend. It's a gift.

663
01:21:11,696 --> 01:21:14,597
- Most kind.
<i>- Heil Hitler.</i>

664
01:21:25,677 --> 01:21:28,840
<i>Wollen sie Bonbon?</i>

665
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:32,075
<i>Nein danke.</i>

666
01:21:53,638 --> 01:21:55,663
<i>Ist gut.</i>

667
01:22:13,691 --> 01:22:16,683
<i>Ist gut. Heil Hitler.</i>

668
01:23:11,749 --> 01:23:14,411
Berlin...
Berlin, half an hour, Madame.

669
01:24:42,373 --> 01:24:45,604
<i>Lillian. Lillian!</i>

670
01:24:49,013 --> 01:24:52,414
<i>Lillian, how good it is to see you.</i>

671
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:56,453
But how naughty not to stay
for more than a few hours.

672
01:24:56,554 --> 01:24:59,387
Give her the candy box.

673
01:24:59,490 --> 01:25:02,516
I've brought a present for you.

674
01:25:16,007 --> 01:25:19,841
When you get outside, look to your left.
You will see a restaurant called Albert's.

675
01:25:19,944 --> 01:25:22,469
You will cross the street
and go into that restaurant.

676
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:24,605
Good luck. Enjoy yourself.

677
01:25:24,715 --> 01:25:26,706
Pleasant to see you again.

678
01:26:46,697 --> 01:26:48,688
Fine. Fine.

679
01:26:48,799 --> 01:26:50,767
I've ordered caviar. We'll celebrate.

680
01:26:50,868 --> 01:26:54,269
Albert had to send out for it,
but he won't be long.

681
01:26:54,372 --> 01:26:57,933
Oh, look at you. Just look at you.

682
01:26:58,042 --> 01:27:00,203
Tell me what to say to you.

683
01:27:00,311 --> 01:27:03,803
It's all right. Everything's fine.
Nothing will happen now.

684
01:27:05,383 --> 01:27:08,750
- How long do we have?
- Not long.

685
01:27:10,188 --> 01:27:12,349
You still look like nobody else.

686
01:27:18,162 --> 01:27:20,596
Why do you have crutches?

687
01:27:20,698 --> 01:27:23,531
I've got a false leg.

688
01:27:28,706 --> 01:27:31,072
- No tears, Lilly.
- I'm sorry.

689
01:27:31,175 --> 01:27:33,973
- It's done. It's what it is.
- When?

690
01:27:34,078 --> 01:27:36,546
You know when. You were there in Vienna.

691
01:27:38,716 --> 01:27:42,015
- No tears. There's no time.
- I'm sorry.

692
01:27:45,022 --> 01:27:47,286
Your fingers are cold. Here.

693
01:27:49,260 --> 01:27:52,024
They took the candy box...
a man and a woman.

694
01:27:53,831 --> 01:27:56,061
That's right. Everything's fine.

695
01:27:58,369 --> 01:28:03,397
Now, what I want you to do is take off
your hat as if it were too hot in here.

696
01:28:03,507 --> 01:28:06,533
Lilly, listen to me. You're not listening.

697
01:28:08,179 --> 01:28:10,306
I'm listening. I am.

698
01:28:10,414 --> 01:28:14,145
<i>Take off your hat, comb your hair,</i>
<i>and put the hat on the seat between us.</i>

699
01:28:15,286 --> 01:28:17,345
Do as I tell you.

700
01:28:22,026 --> 01:28:24,153
<i>Who were you with in Paris?</i>
<i>Good friends?</i>

701
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:28,358
Yes. Good friends.
They don't know anything about this.

702
01:28:28,466 --> 01:28:31,230
- Take out your comb.
- Oh, my comb.

703
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:36,767
Oh, I still carry too much.

704
01:28:36,874 --> 01:28:39,342
There it is. Take it out and use it.

705
01:28:41,379 --> 01:28:44,644
You look so very well.

706
01:28:44,749 --> 01:28:49,448
- I read your play.
<i>- Did you like it?</i> Children's Hour?

707
01:28:49,553 --> 01:28:52,522
I'm proud of you. It was wonderful.

708
01:28:52,623 --> 01:28:55,183
<i>- My second one failed.</i>
- I know. I heard.

709
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:57,853
- So you're writing your third.
- I'm writing it.

710
01:28:57,962 --> 01:29:00,157
I'm going to the toilet. You come with me.

711
01:29:00,264 --> 01:29:05,998
<i>If the waiter tries to come</i>
<i>and help me, you wave him away.</i>

712
01:29:06,103 --> 01:29:08,128
It's all right. I can do it.

713
01:29:08,239 --> 01:29:11,504
The leg doesn't fit properly.
I think it belongs to someone else.

714
01:29:11,609 --> 01:29:14,134
- It has their initials on it.
- Oh, my God.

715
01:29:14,245 --> 01:29:16,805
Act gay. Can you act gay?

716
01:29:17,915 --> 01:29:20,008
Ooh.

717
01:29:20,117 --> 01:29:23,678
<i>Albert, diese Dame</i>
<i>ist meine beste Freundin.</i>

718
01:30:27,351 --> 01:30:30,514
The German public toilets
are always so clean.

719
01:30:30,621 --> 01:30:33,146
So much cleaner than ours in America.

720
01:30:52,209 --> 01:30:55,667
I want you to know that you've been
better than a good friend to me.

721
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,771
You've done something important.

722
01:30:57,882 --> 01:31:00,476
We can save 500 people.

723
01:31:00,584 --> 01:31:02,916
Maybe...

724
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:06,319
Maybe a thousand if we can bargain right.

725
01:31:06,424 --> 01:31:09,416
- Jews?
- About half are Jews.

726
01:31:09,527 --> 01:31:12,360
Political people.

727
01:31:12,463 --> 01:31:16,263
We can only do today what we can do today.

728
01:31:16,367 --> 01:31:18,392
And today you did it for us.

729
01:31:23,441 --> 01:31:26,672
Do you need something stronger?

730
01:31:26,777 --> 01:31:29,302
No.

731
01:31:29,413 --> 01:31:31,938
Do you have a photograph of Hammett?

732
01:31:32,049 --> 01:31:35,348
Yes. I do. I have one.

733
01:31:35,453 --> 01:31:37,978
I wrote you about him.
Did you get that letter?

734
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:40,249
- You get my letters?
- Mmm. Some.

735
01:31:42,927 --> 01:31:44,952
Here.

736
01:31:47,832 --> 01:31:51,359
I like his face. Tell me what he is.

737
01:31:51,469 --> 01:31:53,994
He's remarkable, difficult.

738
01:31:54,104 --> 01:31:57,232
It's not simple together.

739
01:31:57,341 --> 01:31:59,400
I don't know how to describe him.

740
01:31:59,510 --> 01:32:01,842
He's an extraordinary kind of American man.

741
01:32:01,946 --> 01:32:05,245
- I want you to meet him.
- Mmm. I want to. I'm coming to New York.

742
01:32:05,349 --> 01:32:08,045
- When?
- I'll be coming in a few months.

743
01:32:08,152 --> 01:32:10,211
I have to get a better leg.

744
01:32:12,022 --> 01:32:14,650
We have to talk fast now.
There isn't much time.

745
01:32:16,026 --> 01:32:18,494
I need you to do something else for me.

746
01:32:19,697 --> 01:32:21,756
I have a baby.

747
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:28,832
I'll bring her with me
when I come to New York.

748
01:32:28,939 --> 01:32:30,907
I want to leave her with you.

749
01:32:32,776 --> 01:32:35,677
A little girl.

750
01:32:37,615 --> 01:32:41,051
<i>- Where is she?</i>
- She's across the border in Alsace.

751
01:32:41,151 --> 01:32:44,518
She lives with a baker's family.
I can see her whenever I can cross over...

752
01:32:44,622 --> 01:32:46,613
but she shouldn't be in Europe.

753
01:32:46,724 --> 01:32:49,158
It ain't a place for a baby these days.

754
01:32:51,962 --> 01:32:54,430
- What's her name?
<i>- Lilly.</i>

755
01:32:58,969 --> 01:33:01,904
She's fat. She's handsome.
She's very healthy.

756
01:33:02,006 --> 01:33:04,634
She's nearly one year old.

757
01:33:04,742 --> 01:33:07,643
And I don't even mind
that she looks like my mother.

758
01:33:15,519 --> 01:33:17,487
<i>I'll take care of her.</i>

759
01:33:17,588 --> 01:33:20,648
Well, I won't stay away long.
I can't last much longer in Europe.

760
01:33:20,758 --> 01:33:24,319
The crutches make me too noticeable.

761
01:33:24,428 --> 01:33:27,158
<i>You won't have to worry about anything.</i>
<i>There's enough money.</i>

762
01:33:27,264 --> 01:33:30,233
That doesn't matter. You know that.

763
01:33:30,334 --> 01:33:34,600
The father won't disturb you.
He doesn't want to have anything
to do with the baby or with me.

764
01:33:34,705 --> 01:33:39,335
I don't know why I did it.
I don't care. The baby's good.

765
01:33:51,789 --> 01:33:54,417
What is it? Why is it like this?

766
01:33:59,396 --> 01:34:01,830
Are you as angry now as you used to be?

767
01:34:03,467 --> 01:34:06,868
Mm-hmm.
Yes. I try not to be, but there you are.

768
01:34:06,971 --> 01:34:09,439
I like your anger.

769
01:34:09,540 --> 01:34:11,701
You're the only one who does then.

770
01:34:11,809 --> 01:34:14,175
<i>Don't you let anybody talk you out of it.</i>

771
01:34:19,450 --> 01:34:23,113
<i>The man who's going to take care</i>
<i>of you has just come into the street.</i>

772
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:25,814
He'll make sure you get on the train safely.

773
01:34:25,923 --> 01:34:30,223
And there'll be somebody who'll stay with
you till you get to Warsaw tomorrow morning.

774
01:34:31,729 --> 01:34:33,697
I don't want to leave you.

775
01:34:33,797 --> 01:34:36,197
I want to stay with you a few more minutes.

776
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,359
No. Something might still go wrong.

777
01:34:38,469 --> 01:34:41,529
We can't be sure who anyone is anymore.

778
01:34:43,140 --> 01:34:47,736
Now, I want you to stand up, take your hat...

779
01:34:47,845 --> 01:34:50,643
Listen to me. Put your hat back on.

780
01:34:50,748 --> 01:34:53,148
<i>Say good-bye to me and then go.</i>

781
01:35:06,430 --> 01:35:09,729
I'll take care of Lilly. It'll be wonderful.

782
01:35:11,001 --> 01:35:13,060
Put your hat on.

783
01:35:14,772 --> 01:35:16,933
Put the hat on.

784
01:35:19,309 --> 01:35:22,904
Yes. My beloved friend.

785
01:35:23,013 --> 01:35:25,072
Leave.

786
01:36:17,334 --> 01:36:20,064
Good night. Please follow me.

787
01:36:47,464 --> 01:36:49,455
<i>Your ticket, please.</i>

788
01:36:49,566 --> 01:36:51,693
Thank you.

789
01:36:51,802 --> 01:36:55,704
Take care of yourself. My best to everybody.

790
01:36:55,806 --> 01:36:59,333
Thank you very much.
My very best to you, sir. Thank you.

791
01:36:59,443 --> 01:37:02,037
My very best...

792
01:37:03,113 --> 01:37:05,172
Thank you.

793
01:37:21,365 --> 01:37:23,356
- Fräulein Hellman.
<i>- Oui?</i>

794
01:37:23,467 --> 01:37:26,095
You will be asleep
when the border is crossed to Poland.

795
01:37:26,203 --> 01:37:30,105
I will put your suitcase outside for
the customs. I will not wake you, hmm?

796
01:37:32,109 --> 01:37:34,873
Thank you. Do you have a trunk?

797
01:37:34,978 --> 01:37:39,642
- Uh, yes. I have a white trunk
in the baggage compartment.
- Ah. I will need the key, please.

798
01:37:42,386 --> 01:37:45,082
Thank you.

799
01:37:57,334 --> 01:38:00,963
<i> She's turned into a wild socialist,</i>
<i>giving away all her money.</i>

800
01:38:10,314 --> 01:38:14,148
I was with Anne Marie in Vienna,
and I was really in Elba most of the time.

801
01:38:14,251 --> 01:38:17,687
I'm doing a book on Napoléon.
I tried to kill myself in Elba.

802
01:38:20,090 --> 01:38:22,684
Well, you do that every few years, Sammy.

803
01:38:24,995 --> 01:38:27,896
I don't think you should
continue with Napoléon, Sammy.

804
01:38:27,998 --> 01:38:30,831
Why don't you try the Wright brothers?
Or one... one of them.

805
01:38:30,934 --> 01:38:33,334
Try Orville.

806
01:38:33,437 --> 01:38:35,564
What about marriage?

807
01:38:35,672 --> 01:38:39,005
- What about it?
- Still a virgin? Why don't you
marry my brother Eliot?

808
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:42,078
- I gotta go, Sammy.
- You're afraid of me.

809
01:38:42,179 --> 01:38:45,512
You still think I want to
get in your bloomers.

810
01:38:45,616 --> 01:38:48,346
God, Lilly, if you married Eliot,
I'd be your brother-in-law...

811
01:38:48,452 --> 01:38:51,421
- and Anne Marie would be your sister-in-law.
- Oy. Oy.

812
01:38:51,521 --> 01:38:54,786
Too late for horror stories, Sammy.

813
01:38:54,892 --> 01:38:57,952
- You drink too much.
- Hey, you're always so tough on Anne Marie.

814
01:38:58,061 --> 01:39:01,155
What did she ever do to you?
She's really warm and passionate.

815
01:39:01,265 --> 01:39:04,860
Ask me. I know. By the way,
she saw your old friend Julia.

816
01:39:06,603 --> 01:39:09,003
- Where?
- In Vienna.
She's turned into a wild socialist...

817
01:39:09,106 --> 01:39:11,267
giving away all her money.

818
01:39:11,375 --> 01:39:13,366
Listen, Sammy. You tell Anne Marie...

819
01:39:13,477 --> 01:39:17,777
that I don't want to hear any attacks
on Julia's belief or on Julia's life.

820
01:39:17,881 --> 01:39:21,510
Not from her or from you.

821
01:39:21,618 --> 01:39:24,883
- Good-bye, Sammy.
- Oh, come on, Lillian! Anne Marie
doesn't hold ill thoughts.

822
01:39:24,988 --> 01:39:26,979
You understand about relationships.

823
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:29,490
Why, Anne Marie and I were
a battleground all our lives.

824
01:39:29,593 --> 01:39:32,323
And here's something you don't know.
On my graduation day...

825
01:39:32,429 --> 01:39:34,397
my little sister cried like an infant.

826
01:39:34,498 --> 01:39:37,365
She took my arm and kissed me
and gave me a tender touch.

827
01:39:37,467 --> 01:39:40,732
And within minutes...
within minutes, Lillian, it was done.

828
01:39:40,837 --> 01:39:44,238
What I'd wanted to do all those years,
she had the same ideas as I had...

829
01:39:44,341 --> 01:39:46,309
- tucked up inside her someplace.
- Oh, God.

830
01:39:46,410 --> 01:39:49,868
And to this day, of all the girls
I've ever had, my sister was the best.

831
01:39:49,980 --> 01:39:53,541
She was thrilling, Lillian.
And did I ever suspect what she had in mind?

832
01:39:53,650 --> 01:39:56,676
Not for a minute. Don't look at me like that.

833
01:39:56,787 --> 01:39:59,312
She was 16. She was very complicated.

834
01:39:59,423 --> 01:40:01,891
Come on now. You're so slick, so unruffled.

835
01:40:01,992 --> 01:40:05,519
You have no right to turn up your nose.
Your life's no closed book.

836
01:40:05,629 --> 01:40:09,759
No one's scot-free, you know. After all,
the whole world knows about you and Julia.

837
01:40:13,136 --> 01:40:15,866
- What does the whole world know, Sammy?
- Oh.

838
01:40:15,973 --> 01:40:17,941
- What does the world know?
- Oh.

839
01:40:18,041 --> 01:40:20,771
Don't be that way. I'm a sophisticated man.

840
01:40:20,877 --> 01:40:25,041
If anybody understands the sex urge
of the adolescent girl, it's me.

841
01:40:25,148 --> 01:40:28,777
Did you know that in Paris the women
are wearing watches around their legs?

842
01:40:28,885 --> 01:40:30,978
Little garters with timepieces in them.

843
01:41:07,924 --> 01:41:11,223
Good morning. Just to say good-bye
to you and have a happy trip.

844
01:41:12,429 --> 01:41:14,897
You're across the border now.

845
01:41:14,998 --> 01:41:17,762
Your trunk was removed
by the Germans yesterday.

846
01:41:17,868 --> 01:41:21,599
They kept it. They must be suspicious,
but you're in no danger.

847
01:41:21,705 --> 01:41:24,936
Do not return from Moscow through Germany.

848
01:41:25,042 --> 01:41:27,101
Travel another way.

849
01:41:27,210 --> 01:41:30,805
My best regards to your family.
Take care of yourself. Bye-bye now.

850
01:43:18,655 --> 01:43:21,988
- Good night.
- Good night.

851
01:43:23,026 --> 01:43:25,119
Hellman.

852
01:43:32,903 --> 01:43:34,962
<i>Spasiba.</i>

853
01:44:47,344 --> 01:44:50,279
<i>Julia has been killed.</i>

854
01:44:50,380 --> 01:44:55,044
<i>Please advise Moore's Funeral Home,</i>
<i>Whitechapel Road, London...</i>

855
01:44:55,151 --> 01:44:57,381
<i>what disposition.</i>

856
01:44:57,487 --> 01:45:02,754
<i>My sorrow for you. My sorrow for all of us.</i>

857
01:45:02,859 --> 01:45:05,293
<i>Signed, John Watson.</i>

858
01:45:06,863 --> 01:45:10,526
And may I say how sorry I am, madam.

859
01:45:13,937 --> 01:45:17,498
These are the documents you will require.

860
01:45:27,717 --> 01:45:30,151
You wish to see her, madam?

861
01:45:30,253 --> 01:45:34,553
There is rather a deep slash on
her face, which was difficult to cover up.

862
01:45:35,625 --> 01:45:37,593
Yes.

863
01:45:39,963 --> 01:45:42,227
<i>This note was left for you.</i>

864
01:45:51,474 --> 01:45:53,499
<i>It is your right to know...</i>

865
01:45:53,610 --> 01:45:55,805
<i>that the Nazis found her in Frankfurt.</i>

866
01:45:55,912 --> 01:45:59,439
<i>She was in the apartment of a colleague.</i>

867
01:45:59,549 --> 01:46:04,384
<i>We got her to London</i>
<i>in the hope of saving her.</i>

868
01:46:04,487 --> 01:46:08,184
<i>None of us knows what disposition</i>
<i>her family wishes to make.</i>

869
01:46:08,291 --> 01:46:11,692
<i>We could not reach</i>
<i>the grandparents or the mother.</i>

870
01:46:11,795 --> 01:46:15,458
<i>I am sorry that I cannot be there to help you.</i>

871
01:46:15,565 --> 01:46:18,796
<i>It is better that we take our sorrow</i>
<i>for this wonderful woman...</i>

872
01:46:18,902 --> 01:46:22,531
<i>into action and perhaps revenge.</i>

873
01:46:22,639 --> 01:46:27,474
<i>Yours, John Watson,</i>
<i>who speaks here for many others.</i>

874
01:47:05,014 --> 01:47:07,107
<i>I see a gun.</i>

875
01:47:07,217 --> 01:47:10,618
<i> I see a gun,</i>
<i>and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it.</i>

876
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,553
<i> I see a gun,</i>
<i>and a handsome soldier's going to shoot it...</i>

877
01:47:13,656 --> 01:47:15,681
- but it won't shoot.
- I see a gun...

878
01:47:15,792 --> 01:47:18,761
and a handsome soldier's going
to shoot it, but it won't shoot...

879
01:47:18,862 --> 01:47:21,353
and the brave, handsome soldier
says, "I need another gun."

880
01:47:21,464 --> 01:47:25,264
I see a gun, and a handsome soldier's
going to shoot it, but it won't shoot...

881
01:47:25,368 --> 01:47:28,098
and the soldier says, "I need another gun,"

882
01:47:28,204 --> 01:47:30,399
and someone shouts back...

883
01:47:30,507 --> 01:47:34,603
"Sorry, soldier, that's the last gun!"

884
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:39,614
<i>- "That's the last gun!"</i>

885
01:47:39,716 --> 01:47:43,049
Where can I find, uh, John Watson?

886
01:47:43,153 --> 01:47:46,452
I don't know a John Watson, madam.

887
01:47:46,556 --> 01:47:48,717
Well, you gave me a note.
He wrote me a note.

888
01:47:48,825 --> 01:47:51,419
I picked up the note
when I collected the body, madam.

889
01:47:51,528 --> 01:47:54,053
Where did you collect the body?

890
01:47:54,164 --> 01:47:57,998
The house of a Dr. Chester Lowe...

891
01:47:58,101 --> 01:48:00,501
<i>- 18 Willoughby Road.</i>

892
01:48:02,705 --> 01:48:05,936
- Yes?
- Dr. Chester Lowe?

893
01:48:06,042 --> 01:48:08,442
There's no Dr. Chester Lowe here.

894
01:48:08,545 --> 01:48:10,638
This is 18 Willoughby Road.

895
01:48:10,747 --> 01:48:13,307
There's no Dr. Lowe. I'm sorry.

896
01:48:13,416 --> 01:48:16,510
Well, perhaps John Watson then.

897
01:48:16,619 --> 01:48:20,953
I'm sorry. You have the wrong address.

898
01:48:21,057 --> 01:48:23,924
- I'm Julia's friend.
- I'm sorry.

899
01:48:24,027 --> 01:48:28,896
- I have a letter from John Watson.
- You have the wrong address!

900
01:48:38,641 --> 01:48:41,940
<i>She's across the border in Alsace.</i>

901
01:48:42,045 --> 01:48:44,172
<i>She lives with a baker's family.</i>

902
01:48:57,393 --> 01:49:01,693
It's impossible, Madame. Alsace
is not a village. It is a big province.

903
01:49:19,182 --> 01:49:21,912
- Hi.
- Uh...

904
01:49:22,018 --> 01:49:24,543
<i>- Do you speak English?</i>
- Yes.

905
01:49:24,654 --> 01:49:28,750
I'm from America.
Uh, do you know any Americans?

906
01:49:28,858 --> 01:49:31,190
Americans?
What is it you want, madam?

907
01:49:31,294 --> 01:49:34,388
Well, I'm a friend of one that you
might know. I'm looking for her baby.

908
01:49:36,299 --> 01:49:38,358
I'm very busy, you see.

909
01:49:38,468 --> 01:49:40,436
If you don't want bread, I can't help you.

910
01:49:40,537 --> 01:49:44,735
Madam, I'm a friend of Julia’s.

911
01:49:46,543 --> 01:49:49,273
Do you know about a baby named Lilly?

912
01:49:52,882 --> 01:49:54,941
There's no baby here.

913
01:49:55,051 --> 01:49:57,679
<i>There's no baby. Just go and have a look.</i>

914
01:50:06,863 --> 01:50:09,889
<i>There's no baby. I'm sorry.</i>

915
01:50:22,712 --> 01:50:24,839
- Do you need this anymore?
- Ah, no. That's all right.

916
01:50:24,948 --> 01:50:26,916
Is this all you got?

917
01:50:28,217 --> 01:50:30,242
<i>Hey.</i>

918
01:50:55,645 --> 01:51:01,379
Mr. Johann!

919
01:51:07,390 --> 01:51:10,689
Mr. Johann! Hello!

920
01:51:10,793 --> 01:51:13,956
Mr. Johann!

921
01:51:14,063 --> 01:51:17,055
Lilly. Lilly.

922
01:51:17,166 --> 01:51:20,363
It's all right.

923
01:51:20,470 --> 01:51:24,566
All right. Go back to sleep.

924
01:51:30,246 --> 01:51:32,806
- Please, ma'am, you'll have to wait outside.
- I will <i>not</i> wait outside.

925
01:51:32,915 --> 01:51:34,883
What's the trouble, Anna?

926
01:51:34,984 --> 01:51:37,646
Raines, do you remember me?

927
01:51:37,754 --> 01:51:39,722
I used to come here
with Julia on weekends.

928
01:51:39,822 --> 01:51:41,983
Remember, when we were just little children?

929
01:51:42,091 --> 01:51:44,116
You remember, her friend, Lillian.

930
01:51:44,227 --> 01:51:47,594
- I'm afraid I don't.
- Of course, you do.

931
01:51:47,697 --> 01:51:50,359
- Please, to step outside, madam.
- I will not please...

932
01:51:50,466 --> 01:51:54,027
to step anywhere until I talk
to Julia’s grandparents.

933
01:51:54,137 --> 01:51:59,200
- They're on a cruise, madam. They will
not be returning for eight weeks.
- I don't believe you.

934
01:51:59,308 --> 01:52:01,776
- I will take the information...
- Julia has been murdered!

935
01:52:01,878 --> 01:52:04,403
It's not to be referred to as "information."

936
01:52:04,514 --> 01:52:07,950
I have her ashes, and I want them to tell
me what I'm supposed to do with them.

937
01:52:08,051 --> 01:52:10,212
<i>- If you don't leave, I shall have to call...</i>
- She has a child!

938
01:52:10,319 --> 01:52:13,083
- Don't they care about
their granddaughter's child?
- If you don't leave, madam...

939
01:52:13,189 --> 01:52:15,350
- I shall have to call the police.
- Hello!

940
01:53:09,579 --> 01:53:12,571
They never wanted to find the baby.

941
01:53:12,682 --> 01:53:15,150
I did.

942
01:53:15,251 --> 01:53:17,549
You tried.

943
01:53:17,653 --> 01:53:20,053
I didn't try hard enough.

944
01:53:21,491 --> 01:53:23,482
You hired detectives. You had lawyers.

945
01:53:23,593 --> 01:53:27,290
- You did what you could.
- I don't know.

946
01:53:27,396 --> 01:53:29,387
They never wanted to find the baby.

947
01:53:29,499 --> 01:53:31,558
They wanted Julia's money, and they got it.

948
01:53:31,667 --> 01:53:34,693
- I know, the bastards.
- So now let it be.

949
01:53:42,111 --> 01:53:44,909
There's something else now.
There's a war going on over there.

950
01:53:45,014 --> 01:53:47,414
Maybe she's alive in it.

951
01:53:47,517 --> 01:53:49,485
The baby's dead, Lilly.

952
01:53:49,585 --> 01:53:52,145
I won't believe that. You don't know that.

953
01:53:52,255 --> 01:53:55,122
Lillian! The baby is dead.

954
01:53:55,224 --> 01:53:58,193
Julia was and isn't. That's all.

955
01:54:05,968 --> 01:54:09,768
And when you die,
will you want me to feel that way about you?

956
01:54:11,107 --> 01:54:13,974
I'll outlive ya.

957
01:54:14,076 --> 01:54:16,601
Oh, maybe not. You're stubborn.

958
01:54:20,149 --> 01:54:23,607
<i>Hammett didn't outlive me.</i>

959
01:54:23,719 --> 01:54:28,452
<i>We lived together,</i>
<i>off and on, for... 30 years.</i>

960
01:54:28,558 --> 01:54:32,050
<i>And I've gone on</i>
<i>for a good many years since.</i>

961
01:54:32,161 --> 01:54:36,188
<i>Sometimes fine, not always.</i>

962
01:54:37,667 --> 01:54:41,660
<i>But he was right. I</i> am <i>stubborn.</i>

963
01:54:41,771 --> 01:54:44,467
<i>I haven't forgotten either of them.</i>
