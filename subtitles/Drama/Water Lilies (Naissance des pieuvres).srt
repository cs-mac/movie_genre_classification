1
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,717
WATER LILIES

2
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,154
This was the pupils' team.

3
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,990
This ballet was presented by the junior team,

4
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,395
with Hélène,

5
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,079
Marie,

6
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,992
Nina,

7
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,992
Joanna,

8
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,713
Aïda,

9
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,153
Manon,

10
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,596
and their captain...

11
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,032
Floriane.

12
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,431
I was nervous because of my parents.

13
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,755
Are you okay?

14
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,952
I'm waiting until my swimsuit is dry.

15
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,356
I forgot my briefs.

16
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,038
Sorry.

17
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,469
- You sure took your time.
- I had to wait for the hair dryer.

18
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,191
I am a bit scared.

19
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,953
What level?

20
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,151
I don't know. Low.

21
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,078
Beginners.

22
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,632
You can enrol in September.

23
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,156
- Hello.
- Hi, Floriane.

24
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,433
I can't join now?

25
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,157
Bring those in a month with a
medical attest and a cheque.

26
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,551
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

27
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,675
- One is heavier.
- My mum did the laundry.

28
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,996
There's a party tonight.

29
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,549
At one of the girls'.

30
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,678
Everyone is going.

31
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,031
The waterpolo guys...
The synchronized girls.

32
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,349
18.2 cm. That's half a centimetre more.

33
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,393
- Super.
- Shut up, that's good right.

34
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,953
It's nothing.

35
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,037
Want my 28 cm?

36
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,550
I don't know why I'm bothered,
I'm not normal.

37
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,910
Of course you are.

38
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,111
One arm is longer.

39
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,950
- Were you invited?
- Where?

40
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,559
For the swimmers' party.

41
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,637
I know where it is.

42
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:10,149
I'm not wearing too much lipstick.
Otherwise he'll be covered with it.

43
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:15,431
I don't wanna have sex straight away,
but I'm way behind on kissing

44
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,830
I think the countries where they marry off
14-year-old girls are cool.

45
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,315
Everything would be totally different then.

46
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,596
I want to kiss him.

47
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,239
What?

48
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,269
I saw your performance yesterday.

49
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,440
- It was beautiful.
- Really?

50
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,878
Why?

51
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,510
I'd like to see you train.

52
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,318
You got gum?

53
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,669
I need someone to let me in.

54
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,399
Come here.

55
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,516
Does my breath stink?

56
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,953
Sure?

57
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,469
Hello.

58
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,349
Hello.

59
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,959
You alright?

60
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,074
Wait.

61
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,356
- What do you want?
- To go inside.

62
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:13,552
- Why would you want that?
- I want to watch.

63
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,359
If you'll let me in,
I'll do something for you.

64
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,913
Do what?

65
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,879
Anything.

66
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,832
I don't need anything.

67
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,032
Did you bring your swimsuit?

68
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,070
After that we'll do the barracuda.
Or will we do that one last?

69
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,350
That one we will do later.

70
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,916
Shall we start again?

71
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,956
Come in. You'll see it better then.

72
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,274
How do you do it?

73
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,475
I always make a mess.

74
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,469
That's stupid.

75
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:59,389
Oh, no. Boys always look
when a girl is eating a banana.

76
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,272
Everyone knows that.

77
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:06,274
It doesn't bother you.
You're on the other side.

78
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,954
On the side of banana eating girls?

79
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,116
That's what they say...

80
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,118
That you've done it,

81
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,358
- with a lot of guys.
- Yeah, that's true.

82
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,832
And I love it.

83
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,595
I know what you can do for me...

84
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,079
What?

85
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,429
Come to my house this evening.

86
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,232
I don't know where you live.

87
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,797
It's Marie, from swimming.

88
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,393
- What are we going to do?
- We walk.

89
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,152
- Where are we going?
- Not far.

90
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,752
You did it.

91
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,318
Wait here for me.

92
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,434
Bring me home and we're even.

93
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,958
You were gone a long time.

94
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:40,029
You can come tomorrow.
At the pool, 7 o'clock.

95
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,876
Come on, get in. We're leaving.

96
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,599
Can I sit here?

97
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,678
Have you got the money?

98
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,389
Is it okay?

99
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,558
Don't worry.
He can't deny me anything.

100
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,435
- I told him you are my cousin.
- What did he say?

101
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,037
That we look alike.

102
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,670
- Would you like a massage, Floriane?
- No.

103
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,110
Come on, It will help you relax.

104
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,754
- There's no time.
- Yes there is.

105
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,512
You'd better go.

106
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,399
Your friend is being a slut again.

107
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,911
She's not my friend.

108
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,192
Good for you.

109
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,316
Come on. Get yourself ready.

110
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,916
Let's go.

111
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,271
Inspection, girls.

112
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,636
Untidy job, Natacha.

113
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,711
I didn't have enough time.

114
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:24,115
Are you going to tell your husband that?
'I didn't have the time'

115
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,991
In five minutes in the water.
Hurry up.

116
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,596
You can sit over there.

117
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,510
Waterballet number five.

118
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:39,915
7.3; 7.0; 7.0; 7.4; 7.2.

119
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,079
This ballet was presented
by the Stade Français swimmers.

120
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,791
No, the spiral formation
was terrific.

121
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,831
And the spin went well together.

122
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,150
Hey, Girls. 3, 4...

123
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,593
Satisfied?

124
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,910
You coming again tomorrow evening?
Same way as before.

125
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,029
Alright.

126
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,833
I'm mad at you.

127
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,838
I searched for you everywhere.
Where have you been?

128
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,315
Don't tell me you're not coming in.

129
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,751
I was at my cousin's.

130
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,236
So now you suddenly love your family?

131
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,358
I had to.

132
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,916
- Are you alone?
- Mum works in the evening.

133
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,152
Come in, bitch.

134
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,793
- You're slobbering.
- You too.

135
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,513
Take some more.

136
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,913
- Hi, ma'am.
- How are you?

137
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,873
I'm fine. Is Max in?

138
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,353
- I'll bring him back.
- Good.

139
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,313
François.

140
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,757
I am letting out my dog.

141
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,196
I'll be back in an hour.

142
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,358
I won't be here.

143
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,358
Where will you be?

144
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,114
Somewhere else.

145
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,151
I won't be fetching you again.

146
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,714
Take care of your own sex life.

147
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,109
Wait.

148
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:49,152
- I didn't sleep with him.
- I don't care.

149
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,156
Or with anyone else for that matter.

150
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,311
That's not what they say.

151
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,758
I swear it, Marie.

152
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,118
That swimming instructor
who gave me a massage...

153
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,148
He never leaves me
and he chases me in the dressingroom.

154
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,510
He tells me he loves me.
What a joker.

155
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,110
Seeing me half naked drives him crazy.

156
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,752
We kissed once,
which didn't help at all.

157
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,234
I only did it to bait
those stupid bitches.

158
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,158
So they're all bitches?

159
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,517
They don't like me,
so I don't like them.

160
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,557
Girls don't like me.

161
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,154
The guy from the pool...

162
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,916
One day I was training by myself,
and I held my breath under water,

163
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:09,078
Then two hairy legs appeared.

164
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:11,314
and...

165
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:17,077
he had his dick out,
and he showed it to me.

166
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,111
As if a stiff one in cold water
is attractive.

167
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,239
Disgusting.

168
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,712
That's life.

169
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,555
You must have similar stories.

170
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,392
Come on, tell me.

171
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:39,554
Really?

172
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:41,873
Nothing?

173
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,957
You're lucky, Marie.

174
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,592
Very lucky.

175
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,878
Okay, bye.

176
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,714
Bye.

177
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,038
I'm not tired.

178
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,153
Me neither.

179
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,319
Come in.

180
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,472
This is for you.

181
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,079
Try it on.

182
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,032
- In here?
- Don't be bashful.

183
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:53,677
The ceiling is probably
the last thing people see.

184
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:59,831
At least for 90% of the people who die.

185
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,633
Probably.

186
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,031
And if you die,

187
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,836
the last thing you see will be printed
in your eye. Like a photograph.

188
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,158
Imagine all those people
with ceiling in their eyes.

189
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:35,240
Ceilings will never be the same.

190
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,231
I was at François.

191
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,551
It's always the same.

192
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,833
When we get close doing it,
I run away.

193
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,237
- The poor boy doesn't understand.
- So tell him.

194
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,198
I can't.

195
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,239
If you don't wanna do it,
then don't.

196
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,159
I have to.

197
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,674
- Is written where?
- On my face, apparently.

198
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:28,319
If he finds out I'm not a slut,
it's over.

199
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:31,117
Go horseback riding.

200
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,915
That's what you do if you want
a miscarriage.

201
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:40,991
I'll look for an older guy
who doesn't know me.

202
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,157
Where are you going to find him?

203
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,159
I don't know.

204
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,913
In a club.

205
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:52,033
That's horrible.

206
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,595
It'll be over in 10 minutes.

207
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:03,999
You could go with me.

208
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,268
To see you hitting on an old man?

209
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,792
You look good when you wear
your hair like this.

210
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,869
I'm out of here.

211
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,037
My friend's gotta hurry,
her father is waiting.

212
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,749
- What?
- Yeah, her dad.

213
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,754
He was afraid that we would be
picked up by dirty old men.

214
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,314
Bye, daddy.

215
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,314
Thank you.

216
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,630
That stupid asshole was a horrible kisser.

217
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,469
Wait.

218
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,716
I want to ask you something...

219
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,550
- It's not a normal question.
- What does that matter.

220
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,236
I want it to be you, Marie.

221
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,511
I'd like you...

222
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,391
to be my first one.

223
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,236
That you will do it for me,

224
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:42,711
and release me from it.
Then, it will be real.

225
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,152
I can't do that.

226
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,832
Please, Marie.

227
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:33,792
This one is nice.

228
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,794
- And this one?
- Not bad.

229
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,992
- Cover me.
- You're by yourself in this one.

230
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,272
Hello.

231
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,237
Can I help you?

232
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,070
I also have some other models.

233
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,794
Goodbye.

234
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,720
It's like in the film "Peau d'Âne".

235
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,196
It has a horse that shits diamonds.

236
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,551
That nearly went wrong.
I almost swallowed it.

237
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,474
You walk strangely.

238
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,592
It's my new jeans,
they are a bit tight.

239
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,438
Hi.
I would like a Happy Meal.

240
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,278
- How old are you?
- Fifteen.

241
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:44,389
- You are too old.
- That's stupid. It's what I want.

242
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,272
- It's for children.
- Never mind.

243
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,993
But this is ridiculous.

244
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:51,158
You also need ID now to buy
a cheap hamburger?

245
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,510
- Let's go.
- No, I want the little toy.

246
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,950
It's a spyglass.

247
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:03,993
Super.

248
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:07,071
I can see your pores.

249
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,079
Fantastic.

250
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,312
- Are you coming to the swimmingpool later on?
- No.

251
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,753
You always say that, but you'll still be there.

252
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:27,472
- We don't have to do everything together.
- But neither everything apart.

253
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,069
I've had enough of your childish behaviour.

254
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,749
Says she; the little girl without breasts.

255
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,953
You've had breasts since primary school.
But they're not real.

256
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,753
It's all fat.

257
00:55:45,160 --> 00:55:46,832
You're mean.

258
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:51,437
I've had enough.

259
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:54,559
I'm fed up with you.

260
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:37,478
Good, guys.

261
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,109
Out.

262
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,916
Look what he gave me.

263
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,278
Will you put on?

264
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,790
I don't believe in this stuff anymore.
Do you?

265
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,789
No.

266
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,671
I'm in trouble.

267
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,077
He wants to see me tonight.
My parents are out.

268
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,232
I'll do it.

269
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,237
What you asked me.

270
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,559
Wait.

271
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,278
I have to go.

272
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,990
Thank you for everything, Marie.

273
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:27,355
- Hello.
- Hi.

274
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,596
- Thanks for the necklace.
- You're welcome.

275
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:39,312
Are you alone?

276
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,718
Can I come in?

277
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,035
We must not split up, Marie.

278
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,875
I do crazy stuff when I'm alone.

279
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:08,109
Are you going to the swim party tonight?

280
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:10,789
No.

281
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:13,113
Please come.

282
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:16,358
Stay with me.

283
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:19,235
No.

284
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,238
I have to go.

285
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,957
François is also going.

286
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,950
Stop daydreaming.

287
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,319
He is with her.

288
01:08:33,720 --> 01:08:35,836
They did it last night.

289
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,355
- Did not.
- Yes they did.

290
01:08:41,760 --> 01:08:46,470
Let it sink in.
Forget about those stupid princess dreams.

291
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:50,193
- It is not true.
- Yes, it is.

292
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,512
He told me.

293
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,637
As if he talks to you.

294
01:08:58,920 --> 01:09:00,876
We did it.

295
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,235
He stopped by and we did it.

296
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:10,830
He did it with me,
she didn't want to.

297
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:14,792
Maybe he loves me just a little bit.

298
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:19,592
It doesn't matter.

299
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:24,590
I have my first kiss.

300
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,075
Me too, you know...
I love someone as well.

301
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:39,632
Who is it?

302
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,313
Do I know him?

303
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:46,508
No.

304
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,559
Are you going?

305
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,439
Wait.

306
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:36,757
You're okay.

307
01:12:17,720 --> 01:12:21,474
- Come. Let's go.
- I can't leave yet.

308
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:24,353
- Come.
- I am staying.

309
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,272
All by yourself?

310
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:28,912
I am not alone.

311
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,596
Someone is waiting for me.

312
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,955
Are you sure she will?

313
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,150
Come home.
Nobody likes her.

314
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:47,630
Bye.

315
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:50,392
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

316
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:53,273
- Come with me.
- I like it here.

317
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:01,678
What's up?

318
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:10,996
I want to ask you something.

319
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,799
Come here.

320
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:30,789
Come, Marie.

321
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:19,559
You see...

322
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:22,755
That wasn't so hard.

323
01:14:38,920 --> 01:14:40,751
I'm going back.

324
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,591
He isn't half bad, eh?

325
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:59,717
If he turns out to be an ass,
will you come and save me?

326
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:05,000
