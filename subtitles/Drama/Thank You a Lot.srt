I'm here to say

168
00:08:51,296 --> 00:08:54,732
that when someone tries to act
like some sort of an expert,

169

you can respond, "Who says?"

So, cigarettes <i>are</i> good for you?

171
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,139
- No!
- No, that's not...

172
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:03,401
That's not what I'm getting at.

173
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,841
My point is that you have
to think for yourself.

174
00:09:05,944 --> 00:09:07,673
You have to challenge authority.

175
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:10,043
If your parents told you
that chocolate was dangerous,

176
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:11,673
would you just take their word for it?

177
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:12,875
KIDS: No.

178
00:09:12,985 --> 00:09:13,974
Exactly.

179
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:15,917
So perhaps instead of acting
like sheep

180
00:09:16,021 --> 00:09:16,988
when it comes to cigarettes,

181

you should find out for yourself.

every cigarette package

325
00:14:55,627 --> 00:14:58,653
sold in America
will carry this symbol.

326
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,993
Perhaps then, cigarettes
will finally be labeled

327
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:04,193
appropriately as poison.

328
00:15:04,302 --> 00:15:06,167
I will be holding
a congressional hearing

329
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:09,001

to big tobacco.

Perhaps this time they will
grace us with their presence.

334
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,181
And their answers.

335

I look down this table,
all I see are white flags.

Our numbers are down
all across the board.

340

Teen smoking-
our bread and butter,

00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,099
is falling like a shit from heaven.

We don't sell Tic Tacs,
for Christ's sake.

343
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:45,670
We sell cigarettes.

And they're cool and available
and addictive.

345

The job is almost done for us.

346

This environmentalist
is challenging us.

347
00:15:58,223 --> 00:16:00,783
We have to have an answer.

348
00:16:00,892 --> 00:16:02,587
I'm asking you,

349
00:16:02,694 --> 00:16:04,525
when this cocksucker puts
Captain Hook on our products,

350
00:16:04,629 --> 00:16:06,153
what the fuck are we going to do?

351
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:08,824
- BR.
- Yeah, Nick.

352
00:16:08,934 --> 00:16:10,128
If I may.

353
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:12,669
In 1910,

354
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:15,262
the U.S. was producing
ten billion cigarettes a year.

355
00:16:15,373 --> 00:16:16,499
By 1930,

356
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:18,576
we were up to 123 billion.

357
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:20,645
What happened in between?

358
00:16:20,745 --> 00:16:22,406
Three things.

359
00:16:22,514 --> 00:16:23,481
A world war,

360
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:27,450
dieting... and movies.

361
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,780
Movies?

362
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:31,913
1927-talking pictures are born.

363
00:16:32,023 --> 00:16:34,253
Suddenly, directors need to give
their actors

364
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,293
something to do
while they're talking.

365
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:39,090
Cary Grant, Carole Lombard
are lighting up.

366
00:16:39,197 --> 00:16:40,664
Bette Davis- a chimney.

367
00:16:40,765 --> 00:16:42,062
And Bogart-
remember the first picture

368
00:16:42,167 --> 00:16:43,225
with him and Lauren Bacall?

369
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,803
Well, yea... not specifically.

370
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,166
Oh, she sort

371
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,365

19 years old.

373
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,143
Pure sex.

374
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:54,142
She says,

00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,475
"Anyone got a match?"

376
00:16:56,581 --> 00:16:58,276
And Bogie throws
the matches at her...

377
00:16:59,784 --> 00:17:01,684
and she catches them.

378
00:17:01,786 --> 00:17:05,347
Greatest romance of the century.

379

How'd it start?
Lighting a cigarette.

380
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,194
These days when someone
smokes in the movies,

381
00:17:10,295 --> 00:17:13,526
they're either a psychopath
or a European.

382
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,532
The message Hollywood
needs to send out

383
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,602
is smoking is cool.

384
00:17:17,702 --> 00:17:20,000
We need the cast of <i>Will and Grace</i>

385
00:17:20,105 --> 00:17:21,470
smoking in their living room.

386

between his box of chocolates.

by buying her favorite brand-
her Virginia Slims.

389
00:17:31,816 --> 00:17:35,343
Most of the actors smoke already.

390
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:37,683
If they start doing it on-screen,

391
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:40,485
we can put the sex
back into cigarettes.

392
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,152
Well, it's a thought.

393
00:17:43,261 --> 00:17:45,058
I was hoping for something
a little more inspiring,

394
00:17:45,163 --> 00:17:46,187
but at least you're thinking.

1952 was the year

nailed us with
the whole health aspect.

451

As Churchill said,

just a little bit
of myself when I was your age.

465

You stayed loyal.

466
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:01,924
And you gave it
to that son of a bitch good.

- [ <i>chuckles</i> ]

Now, BR's come under the idea

469
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:13,766
that we should start bribing
producers in Hollywood

470
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:17,535
to make the actors smoke on screen.

471
00:21:17,642 --> 00:21:20,634
You know, like in the old days.

472
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:23,009
Say, that's, uh...

473

that's a great idea.

474
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:26,916
Mm-hmm.

Yes, sir?

These nicotine patches
