1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,620
This film was inspired by real events,
but characters have been ivented.

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,620
Any resemblance to any living or
missing person is accidental.

3
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,500
I'm scared.

4
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,420
Quiet! They'll hear us.

5
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:27,500
You'll see.

6
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,820
Don't move. If they see you,
they'll zap you.

7
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,020
How do you know?

8
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,620
Shh! Stay put
until I say coast's clear.

9
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,500
Is that a little green man?

10
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,620
They're armed, and really dangerous.

11
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:59,220
Wait, youll see.
They're leaving... now.

12
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,420
All right.

13
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,620
Careful.

14
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,220
They have lasers.

15
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,300
I've something in my boot.

16
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,900
An earthling?

17
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,820
A transmitter.

18
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,020
See his antenna?

19
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
Destroy it.

20
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,300
Let's go.

21
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,820
-And him?
- A little green spy. Can't miss.

22
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,820
Shit!

23
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:25,020
You see? Bull's eye!

24
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:56,020
<i>Peepee on the grass</i>
<i>to bug the ladybirds.</i>

25
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,420
<i>Peepee on the grass</i>
<i>to bug the ladybirds.</i>

26
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,100
Move!

27
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,700
Wait for me, Nadine.

28
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,300
You know, the school had
a big black door and a little window...

29
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,620
...we opened like this.

30
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:23,620
Mummy, when you were small
did you like school?

31
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,620
No. I'd pretend to be sick.

32
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,900
I'd walk barefoot on wet grass.

33
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,900
When it snowed,
I'd go out with wet hair.

34
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,020
So I'd be sick.

35
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,620
That's naughty!

36
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,420
I like school.

37
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,020
You're a model child.
I was only good at gym.

38
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,100
Oliver's terrible at gym.

39
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,020
He's only little.

40
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,620
Cleaned your teeth?

41
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,420
Wake up, Mummy!
I'm here.

42
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,100
Yes, go to sleep, darling.

43
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,100
Landed?

44
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,900
Landed. I'm here.

45
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,500
Both of you.

46
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,100
Read me a story too.

47
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:16,900
A fairy tale?

48
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,220
- Sing so I can hear.
- You prefer a song?

49
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,820
Which song?

50
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,700
"The Angels"?

51
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:53,900
<i>The angels are leaning</i>
<i>over your bed</i>

52
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:02,700
<i>Tired, they complain</i>
<i>Leave the crying dead</i>

53
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:11,420
<i>In heaven God laughs</i>
<i>to see you so peaceful</i>

54
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:20,620
<i>And the seven archangels</i>
<i>share his joy</i>

55
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:30,420
<i>I kiss you, I kiss you</i>
<i>My little chick</i>

56
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:40,100
<i>Oh, how I'll miss you</i>
<i>when you've grown up</i>

57
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,820
Sleep.

58
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,820
Sleep, my sweet little chick.

59
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:01,700
Good night, my little girl,
my big girl, sleep...

60
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,500
Oliver...

61
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,420
You asleep?

62
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,700
No.

63
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,620
Do you see them?

64
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,300
Turn your light off.

65
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,300
You'll see little lights
blinking on and off.

66
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,620
Blinking on and off.

67
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,500
Im scared.

68
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,100
They're flying around your bed,
they're heading for the door.

69
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,100
Watch out!

70
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,700
Stop!

71
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,220
You won't see them like that.

72
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,620
I'll tell Mummy you frightened me.

73
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,420
Do, and I'll won't play with you.

74
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,620
I'm worried about mother,
she's not well.

75
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,020
I had to yell at her.

76
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,420
She shouldn't be alone.

77
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,900
You have better idea?
She's stubborn.

78
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
You two together - no thanks.

79
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,300
She won't go into a home
without her dog.

80
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,300
The poor thing's too fat to move.

81
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,900
What's up?

82
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,620
Nothing, I thought I heard Olivier
crying.

83
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,820
You should see a doctor.
You worry me sometimes.

84
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:42,100
Epilepsy starts like that,
with black-outs and then...

85
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,500
You shouödn't drive.

86
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,420
That's stupid.

87
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,300
Take Mother her lunch tomorrow.

88
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Eggs and chopped liver for Mimi.
Mimi loves that.

89
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,300
Mimi?

90
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,700
Mimi, mother's dog.

91
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,900
The insurance is tomorrow.

92
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,620
Send Nadine, or the boy.
They won't mind.

93
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,220
What a country.
More holidays than school.

94
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,820
It's filthy down here.

95
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,220
You don't sweep under the bed?

96
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,700
What else do you have to do?

97
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,500
The house and the children.

98
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,300
Good night, Serge.

99
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,820
I thought we'd finished with all that.

100
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,100
I thought we'd finished with all that.

101
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:22,020
You're not helping him. He's nine,
you treat him like a baby.

102
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,820
That's enough play-acting.

103
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:34,820
He's not a girl, not a teddy bear,
he's a boy.

104
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,900
I won't let you turn him
into one of them.

105
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,500
Mummy's boy, a faggot!

106
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,100
Go to sleep.

107
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,700
Are you all nuts? Do you know
what time it is?

108
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,700
After a day I've had...

109
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,420
You could have some respect.

110
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,700
It's you I work for.

111
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,620
But it's me that gets the shit.

112
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:18,300
Come on, go to sleep.

113
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,900
Good night, darling.

114
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,700
-Can't you sleep?
-No, you win. I can't sleep.

115
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,300
Could you warm my legs?

116
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,020
Cold?

117
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:18,100
-I'm afraid.
-Afraid of what?

118
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,820
I saw a 'plane on television today.

119
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,820
The one that crashed. All those people
were ripped apart.

120
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,820
Torn to shreds.

121
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,220
Children too.

122
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,100
Stop, there are no pilots in the
family.

123
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,620
Let's sleep.

124
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:54,820
Hold my hand.

125
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,220
What?

126
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,620
Nothing.

127
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,900
Good morning, Elisabeth.

128
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,820
Good morning, Marcel.

129
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,220
What's happened to the eggs?

130
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,900
-I'm here.
-Where's here?

131
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,820
The lavatory.

132
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,220
You have been there for an hour.

133
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,100
Where's Nadine hiding?

134
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,700
At Babette's.

135
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,820
You'll take Grannie's lunch,
right? Please.

136
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,500
-Now what?
-You know.

137
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,620
You're too big for that.

138
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,700
Please, Mummy.

139
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,820
-What would Daddy say?
- He's not here.

140
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:50,620
I don'tknow why you can't do it
yourself.

141
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,700
-I don't like it.
-And me?

142
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,500
You always say I'm delicate.

143
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,020
-It's the last time.
-I promise.

144
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,500
Do extra-terrestrials go caca too?

145
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,820
Extra-terrestrials? Yes, theirs are blue.

146
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,020
Time to go to Grannie's.

147
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,620
Stand up. Does that still hurt?

148
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,500
Not at all.

149
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,620
Wait, sweetie.

150
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,420
-Can I take Nadine's bike?
-Why?

151
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:45,220
-My chain slips.
-Tell Daddy, he'll fix it.

152
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,500
Will Daddy fetch me?
-If you like.

153
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,700
Hands off my bike!

154
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,300
You'll pay for it tonight.
Stop, Oliver!

155
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,220
Come and see.

156
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,500
He's no better?

157
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,300
No, he coughs and then...

158
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,220
He hasn't eaten for days.

159
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,100
-Have you taken his temperature?
-He won't let me.

160
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,820
Back already?

161
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,900
It's too much.

162
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,220
Leaving an old woman without food.
You're careless, or nuts.

163
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:17,020
No food all day?

164
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,420
Olivier. Where is Olivier?

165
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,620
You didn't bring him?

166
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,300
Where from?

167
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,300
He took your mothers food.

168
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,420
When?

169
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,620
At one.

170
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,620
She hasn't see him?

171
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,700
He's gone, for ever!

172
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,300
Maybe he's with Jacques.

173
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,820
Jacques just phoned.

174
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,420
I knew it.

175
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,900
Then he's with someone else.

176
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,020
Take him.

177
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:14,300
Please don't go.

178
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
-Stay.
-I must watch Paul.

179
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,620
You haven't seen Olivier?

180
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:29,500
She sent him with your lunch.

181
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,620
If I knew, I wouldn't be asking.

182
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,620
Give me a break, don't be difficult.

183
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,020
Olivier, come back!

184
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,220
Go to bed.

185
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:30,020
Do you know any reason that
the child might have run away?

186
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,420
To avoid punishment?

187
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,420
Was he naughty?

188
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,620
Did he say anything?

189
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,100
I wonder if you had a little scrap?

190
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,620
I know you don't remember anything
today, but if you do...

191
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,220
You'll find him, won't you?

192
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Chief, this is Marcel.

193
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,500
When did you see the boy?

194
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,100
It must have been around one.
He rode past on his bike.

195
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,300
How far away was he?

196
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,020
About fifty metres.

197
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:38,500
I asked him to bring me some
cigarettes.

198
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,620
I gave him money for sweets.

199
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:47,620
He said "yes" then he went on,
that's all.

200
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,420
He's my sweetie.

201
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:56,420
You'll bring him back to me.

202
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,020
You must... promise me.

203
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,820
Promise!

204
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,820
I promise.

205
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,620
-Really?
- I promise.

206
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,500
Make them find him.
Make them find him.

207
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,220
Elisabeth, please...

208
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,500
Eat something, please.

209
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,700
I'll do as I like.

210
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,300
Jean-Pierre phoned.

211
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,220
They want vets in Chad.

212
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,620
In Africa?

213
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,700
-North of Cameroons.
-Can we come?

214
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,100
I've applied. It would be interesting.

215
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Taking your mother?

216
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,620
She's going into a home.
She finally understood.

217
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:10,900
Pitiy it wasn't sooner.

218
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,700
Please, Elisabeth.

219
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:28,220
I'm not leaving, or there'll be no
one here when he returns.

220
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,500
You've buried him already!

221
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,020
As if he didn't axist any more,
as if it were all over.

222
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,500
He's my son too.

223
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,820
<i>I kiss you, I kiss you, my sweet</i>

224
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:20,300
<i>Because I shall miss you so,</i>
<i>I shall miss you so</i>

225
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,420
<i>When you've grown up</i>

226
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,300
You've touched Oliver's things.

227
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,620
Not true!

228
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,300
Don't lie! Don't lie to me!

229
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,700
I borrowed a marker.

230
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,220
Dirty little selfish liar!

231
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,220
If only you'd taken the lunch
as I asked.

232
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,620
-He'd still be with us!
-It's not my fault!

233
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,300
It's your fault and your father's fault!

234
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,620
That's enough! Are you sick?

235
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,900
Look what you've done to her!

236
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:04,900
If it's not your böoody mother...
it's the goose!

237
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,500
Do you wish it had been her?

238
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,900
Yes, I do!

239
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,700
I wish it had been her!

240
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,620
I've had enogh of this!

241
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,100
I won't put up with it!

242
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:21,420
If you'd made an effort, for once...

243
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,420
You loser.

244
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,020
You're an impotent little country vet.

245
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,100
I loathe you.

246
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,100
I put up with it for Oliver's sake!

247
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,420
You won't have to put uo with me
much longer.

248
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,420
Did you cut yourself?

249
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,500
I'm sorry.

250
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,820
My little girl.

251
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:48,900
Forgive me... forgive me.

252
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,100
Leave me alone.

253
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,820
Don't.

254
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,020
Give me a child!

255
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,500
Give me a child!

256
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,020
Has something happened?

257
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,900
No, I just wanted to talk with you.

258
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,100
Ice-cream?

259
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,820
I'm not running away from you.

260
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,900
Look at me.

261
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:17,500
I thought it would be better.

262
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:22,220
Because I can't take any more.

263
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,620
Youll understand when you're older.

264
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,420
What is there to understand?

265
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,100
That it's better for us all.

266
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,700
You can choose...

267
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:41,900
WHen I'm settled, you can follow me.

268
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,500
You could go to school...

269
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,300
Live with me, have a great time.

270
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,900
You want to stay?

271
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,900
What's that?

272
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,500
What does it mean?

273
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,820
I hate you?

274
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,300
I've done all I can.

275
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,100
I've gone door to door.

276
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:22,900
I've put ads everywhere.
We couldn't have done more.

277
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,100
We couldn't face together.

278
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,300
It's not our fault.

279
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,220
-Understand?
-No.

280
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,900
You must understand.

281
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:36,820
Shit, this isn't a confessional!

282
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,620
Look at the state you put us in,
your mother and me!

283
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,420
I won't let you.

284
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,700
I'll stand up for myself.

285
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,900
Poor Daddy.

286
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,900
I'm staying.

287
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:51,020
I've come to say goodbye.

288
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:53,700
I'm moving to Paris.

289
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:12,020
I've been meaning to get rid of it,
it's full of dust.

290
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,620
Marcel's helping.

291
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,100
It's too much for me...

292
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,820
The children wanted a fish pond,
Serge didn't have time.

293
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,900
I did all I could.

294
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,620
You're abadoning us.

295
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,020
I won't abadon Olivier.

296
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,500
You know he was born twice?

297
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,900
He was born twice.

298
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,420
His sister was no problem, but
he was born at seven months.

299
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,900
They put him on me.

300
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,900
All pink and sweet...

301
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,620
Suddenly...

302
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:00,220
I wanted to cuddle him,
he turned blue...

303
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,500
First his little hands, then his feet...

304
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,020
Then his body.

305
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,700
Serge yelled for help.

306
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,220
They took him away.

307
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:15,700
Intensive care.

308
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,820
It seemed an age.

309
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,700
The nurse come back.

310
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,220
She said he'd live.

311
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,020
And Serge... Serge fainted.

312
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,620
He's a doctor: well, a vet.

313
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,100
He fainted, from joy.

314
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,220
He was delighted, afterwards...

315
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Youll catch cold.

316
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,620
Yes, my love.

317
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,300
It's turning cold.

318
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,220
Olivier only has a T-shirt.

319
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,020
PARIS, SIX YEARS LATER

320
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,900
Have you eaten women's eyes?

321
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,820
This one's for you.

322
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,900
Why not hug me?

323
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,620
You're a bore.

324
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,820
I'll kill you!

325
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,500
Let me go! I'll come clean.

326
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,700
It's a mistake. That whore planted it.

327
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:28,020
Mickey, I see you every week.
I'm tired of you.

328
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,220
I'll get you.

329
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,820
Calm down.

330
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,300
I don't do drugs!

331
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,900
It's that cheap tart.

332
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm innocent.

333
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,700
Believe me.

334
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:44,420
Believe me, man.
I'll kill you!

335
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,620
Don't move!

336
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,020
I'll have your hide!

337
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,820
I'll smash your face!

338
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,820
Fancy me?

339
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,220
Take the hat off.

340
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,620
I came to find Mother.

341
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,420
A Baltic princess,
ditched by the Emir.

342
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,500
She works as a cleaner.

343
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,820
She's Scandinavian.

344
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,100
What's her name?

345
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,420
Greta Garbo.

346
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,900
Barely fifteen.

347
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,020
Too young for you?

348
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,900
A bullshitter!

349
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,820
Should be on the stage.

350
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,220
I'll own up.
I'm Sebastian Blanche.

351
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,700
My stepfather screwed me
in the bathroom.

352
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,820
Now I go for urinals.

353
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,220
You'll be staying a while.

354
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:01,900
I don't take drugs, I don't steal.

355
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,100
I've money, I'm clean.

356
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,020
I live with a friend.

357
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,900
-I can...
- Wait.

358
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,500
Give me your hand.

359
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
May I?

360
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,020
I won't hit you.

361
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,020
I'll tell you a story.

362
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,820
Once upon a time a boy lived
with his daddy and mummy.

363
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,220
So what?

364
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,620
I don't care.

365
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,900
He had a big sister.

366
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,100
They had a big house.

367
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,700
They loved him,
they were all happy.

368
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:59,700
One day he put on his red cap,
took his bike...

369
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:05,620
...to take lunch to his sick grandmother
not far away.

370
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,620
He never came back.

371
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,900
Six years ago.

372
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,020
Now they all think the little boy's
dead.

373
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,500
Exept his mother,
because she's his mother.

374
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:31,300
Every year she buys him new clothes,
she thinks he's growing up.

375
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,500
One day he'll be back.

376
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Boss, got a second?

377
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,020
-Well?
-I don't know.

378
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,420
Come on, his reaction...
I'm sure.

379
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:58,700
It was my first case.

380
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:03,020
Ill send the files.
Let me deal with it.

381
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:05,820
What if it's not him?

382
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,220
It's him.

383
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,620
What happens now?

384
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,500
There are three options. One,
the judge and borstal.

385
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,820
Second, I put you back on the street
with your... friends.

386
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,700
Third...

387
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,620
Why did you scarper?

388
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,900
I don't remember.

389
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,900
Your mother's fantastic.

390
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:55,100
She couldn't deserve
what you've done to her.

391
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,420
If I say I am...
can I go?

392
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:01,020
I'm taking you to her,
arsehole.

393
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,500
O.K., Olivier?

394
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,620
It's ages since anyone called me that.

395
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,020
Olivier who?

396
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,300
-Another interrogation?
-Why not?

397
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,820
Olivier Duval.

398
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,620
Your mother first name?

399
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,020
Elisabeth.

400
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,420
Your brother's name?

401
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,420
Just a sister, Nadine.

402
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,540
You're not family.

403
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,220
It must be him.

404
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:57,620
He knowes names, dates.
The resemblance is striking.

405
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,620
If you have any doubts, we'll make him
talk some more.

406
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,620
You're joking. I'll know at once!

407
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:14,620
Don't rush him.
He's been through a lot.

408
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,820
He's like a wild cat,
you will have to tame him.

409
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,700
Luckily, he's not HIV positive.

410
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
What's he like?
Taller?

411
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,900
Taller than you.

412
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,100
Did he say why...?

413
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,620
Listen, don't rush him. Wait.

414
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:43,900
One day he might say what
happened, if he wants to.

415
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,020
This is it.

416
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,300
How do I look?

417
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:54,100
Fine.

418
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,020
I'll be quick.

419
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:17,820
Is that O.K.?

420
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:19,300
Fine.

421
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,620
Quickly.

422
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,020
Is this O.K.?

423
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:20,700
It's what you like,
what you used to like, I mean.

424
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,020
I thought you could choose.

425
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,500
There's rye...

426
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,220
Some cheese, where is it?

427
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:39,220
With strong mustard,
is that O.K.?

428
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,700
Forgive me?

429
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:16,820
You'll see, everything will be
normal.

430
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:23,020
I'll do my best, a normal life,
a normal home.

431
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,100
A real home with a real life.

432
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,620
Nadine!

433
00:49:49,420 --> 00:49:52,300
Do yiu want your daughter
or Oliver's sister?

434
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,020
Open up, Nadine.

435
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,500
We're closed.

436
00:49:56,020 --> 00:49:57,300
O.K..

437
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:03,100
Drop the gun.

438
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,500
Did you sleep well?

439
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:11,700
How's the Infant Jesus?

440
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,300
Cuddled him?
Breast-fed him?

441
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,820
Put him to bed?

442
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,020
Now, listen... what a pigsty
this room is!

443
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,900
It won't do. Bras in you notes!

444
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:28,220
Really, Nadine.

445
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,820
Get dressed.

446
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,620
Put this on. This would go well
with it.

447
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,820
Is thus the New order?

448
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,700
This room stinks like a zoo.

449
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,020
A young girl's room!

450
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,500
Close the window.

451
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,700
Why?

452
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:48,100
I'm cold. I hate draughts.

453
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,820
You need air.

454
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:51,700
Stop it!

455
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:55,020
-What you are doing?
-I'm cold.

456
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,820
Will you leave it shut?

457
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,100
You're hyped up.

458
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:06,300
Stop, you are overdoing it.

459
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:09,020
You're crazy.

460
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,300
Kiss each other.

461
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,420
Say hello.

462
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:32,220
Nadine, tell Marcel to bring two ducks.

463
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,220
Exploiting your slave?

464
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:37,020
Not me, your man Friday.

465
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,900
Take yor brother.
He'd like that.

466
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,020
Ask Marcel over.

467
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:30,620
Nadine!

468
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:54,220
Nadine!

469
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,300
Who's that?

470
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,900
Wipe your face.

471
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,700
It's a girl's.

472
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:29,700
-You haven't seen her?
-There are no girls here.

473
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,420
She came this way.

474
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,700
My sister.

475
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,820
It's me, Olivier.

476
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,700
Olivier disappeared.

477
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,100
I'm back.

478
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:56,500
Nadine! Wait!

479
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,700
Let's go.

480
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,220
This is yours.

481
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:08,900
Keep it as a souvenir.

482
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,620
Aren't we going to Marcel's?

483
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,620
For the duck?

484
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,220
That was him, with the shovel?

485
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:22,220
I can't remember.

486
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,420
It's not suprising. He moved
after you left.

487
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,420
You see.

488
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,300
For safety's sake.

489
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:37,500
If you hang yourself,
it won't be my fault.

490
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:14,220
Recognize me?

491
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:34,300
-You didn't question him?
- No. Do I question you?

492
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:38,300
-I've nothing to hide?
-Really?

493
00:55:43,900 --> 00:55:48,820
We have to, to find out where he was,
what he's done.

494
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,300
Why he didn't contact us.

495
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,300
I know, but I'm scared.

496
00:55:56,620 --> 00:56:00,020
He's so independent. He'll go
if we question him.

497
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,620
We have friends...

498
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:10,220
We can't pretend nothing happened.

499
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,220
He must live here.

500
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:16,300
He must go to school.

501
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,300
What do you care,
in Africa?

502
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,820
It's my business.

503
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:33,900
What of we came with you?
For appearances sake.

504
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:39,900
I'm not going back.
Chad is over.

505
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,300
I'm a loser there too.

506
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,100
You're not a loser.

507
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:12,100
Strange. We thought
he had no ear for music.

508
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,620
He's musical, like you.

509
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,900
Have you seen Nadine?

510
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,620
She's in the bath.

511
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:28,420
As usual. Nadine! I hope
you remembered to invite Marcel

512
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:33,900
Marcel was the last one
to see you.

513
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:42,980
Hello!
- Good afternoon.

514
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:45,820
-Are we desturbing you?
-No.

515
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,900
-Mummy baked a cake.
-How nice.

516
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,620
Good afternoon.

517
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:58,220
Pack your old clothes and toys.

518
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:03,500
Paul can have them.
Serge will come with you.

519
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:08,620
You've really chasnged.
You're pretty.

520
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,700
Did extra-terrestrials take you?

521
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,820
How did yiu know?

522
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,700
Nadine told me.

523
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,220
Were you in space?

524
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,500
Attention!

525
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,820
Here you are.

526
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:24,220
Keys.

527
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:26,020
In the hall.

528
00:59:33,220 --> 00:59:34,700
Shit!

529
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,220
Beautiful, isn't?

530
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,020
The neighbours!

531
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,220
Thank you.

532
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,020
Now something for Nadine.

533
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:27,220
From the Barbary Coast.

534
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:31,300
He wants the banana.

535
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:32,620
He's adopted you.

536
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:34,420
You'll have to name him.

537
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,100
He's cute.

538
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:41,700
He knew you at once.

539
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,900
She's happy.
Right champagne!

540
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,820
-He understood.
-Amazing.

541
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,300
He's not afraid, much...

542
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:07,420
Now we've had the presents,
what do you have to say?

543
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:09,220
I'll be off.

544
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,820
No, you're family.

545
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,500
Serge, please, not tonight.

546
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:16,020
Please

547
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,300
He has a voice. He's not intimidated,
are you?

548
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:25,300
No, it's O.K.. Well, to start with,
I was bought up by ET.

549
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,820
Ask Nadine, she knows.
Extra-terrestrials in a flying saucer.

550
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:38,020
Don't push it Dad.

551
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,100
Everything was so nice.

552
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:44,500
I'd rather know. I choose a test.

553
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,420
Look at my present.

554
01:01:53,020 --> 01:01:57,620
Is this: a) Mum's mother?
b) Dad's mother?

555
01:01:57,820 --> 01:01:59,900
c)aunt Rosalie from Grenoble?

556
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,700
Two, you had your appendix out:

557
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:06,620
a)at the age of two?
b)two months before you left?

558
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:08,220
c)never?

559
01:02:08,820 --> 01:02:11,620
Your favourite cap was:
green, red, yellow?

560
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,500
Your best friend at school was:
Jacques...?

561
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:16,220
Stop it, Nadine!

562
01:02:16,420 --> 01:02:17,500
You're diabolical!

563
01:02:18,020 --> 01:02:20,420
I'm not afraid of the truth.

564
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,420
-Say sorry!
-When he's passed.

565
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:27,420
Calm down, calm down!

566
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,100
If he wants, he can answer
tomorrow.

567
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:34,700
You're right to want to refresh his
memory, to get it out of him.

568
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,620
But Mum's right, it's not the time.
Come on, please.

569
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:43,900
It strikes me you resemble
a Biblical character...

570
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,620
This is news. Which one?

571
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:51,220
Pontius Pilate, for example.

572
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:57,420
Nadine! Nadine!

573
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:19,220
Nadine hates me.

574
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:23,020
She's jealous, she always has been.

575
01:03:26,620 --> 01:03:28,900
Come on, try the shirts.

576
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,420
I hope they're O.K..

577
01:03:37,020 --> 01:03:38,420
What was I like?

578
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,420
Affectionate, happy
during the day.

579
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,020
Afraid at night.

580
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:53,100
Wouldn't sleep alone.

581
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:58,220
You'd cry for nothing.

582
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,820
Nadine was more boyish.

583
01:04:04,220 --> 01:04:05,620
What's that?

584
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:07,860
That?
- Yes.

585
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:16,620
Serge! Serge!

586
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,020
She calmed down.

587
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,020
He's got the same appendix scar.

588
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,620
Not now, not yet.

589
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:12,300
Now, I want you now.

590
01:05:18,220 --> 01:05:20,220
I missed you!!

591
01:05:25,620 --> 01:05:29,700
You can't imagine how much
I missed you... I missed you.

592
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,700
Gently, my love.

593
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,420
Come and see!

594
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:45,620
What's the matter?

595
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:51,220
You shit!

596
01:06:53,500 --> 01:06:56,820
Flipping for the sweet little family?

597
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:59,420
Do you know what I could do to you?

598
01:06:59,700 --> 01:07:00,820
You shit!

599
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:04,820
What's going on?

600
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:09,420
What's wrong?

601
01:07:09,620 --> 01:07:11,100
Nothing.

602
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:19,500
Listen, Nadine. I'm warning you.

603
01:07:20,100 --> 01:07:23,500
You're not alone with your mother
any more.

604
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:40,900
Nadine, open up. Open this door.
Come on, open it.

605
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,420
It's me.

606
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:56,620
Shit!

607
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,500
You're overdoing it.

608
01:08:17,020 --> 01:08:21,420
<i>The worst grief is not knowing,</i>
<i>without love oe hate...</i>

609
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,020
<i>...my heart is full of pain</i>

610
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,020
<i>I remember</i>

611
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:31,900
<i>Remember the orphanage</i>
<i>of stations?</i>

612
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:38,020
<i>All day we passed through towns...</i>

613
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:44,420
<i>...turned and vomited.</i>
<i>Night, sun, days</i>

614
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:50,900
<i>Oh, sailor. Oh, somre women...</i>

615
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,300
<i>O, my companions!</i>

616
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:57,020
<i>Hey, Mickey. Remember them?</i>

617
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:05,900
<i>You don't want to break the peace?</i>
<i>Leave him alone, he didn't hurt you!</i>

618
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:35,300
Serge, come back. Listen,
I can't go on.

619
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,620
Nadine,'s growing up too fast.

620
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,700
I remember the last time
I sang "The Angels" to her.

621
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:49,900
You ask if I drink
a stupid question.

622
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,300
I've warmed them for you.

623
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:55,300
Is it nice?

624
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,420
Stop making crumbs.

625
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,500
You amaze me.

626
01:11:03,900 --> 01:11:06,220
I thought you had dignity.

627
01:11:07,620 --> 01:11:08,500
Stop.

628
01:11:08,820 --> 01:11:13,500
They dropped you like an old shoe.
True?

629
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:15,900
They left us alone.

630
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:20,020
They come back and
you wait on them.

631
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,500
You lick their boots, their arses...

632
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:24,420
Mind your language!

633
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:30,700
We were happy togetker,
you always said so.

634
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:32,620
What can I say?

635
01:11:34,020 --> 01:11:36,500
It was a nightmare,
I lived for you.

636
01:11:36,820 --> 01:11:39,220
Poor tart, you have your men now!

637
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:40,900
Screwing you!

638
01:11:43,420 --> 01:11:46,100
Wait till you love someone.

639
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:48,500
Never.

640
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,220
I'm not blackmailing you.

641
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:24,300
If you do it again,
I won't survive it.

642
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,900
Hello!

643
01:13:01,500 --> 01:13:02,900
It's yours?

644
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,020
The prodigal son's bribe.

645
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,020
Go for a ride?

646
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:09,060
Climb on.

647
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,700
It's not true.

648
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:02,020
What a mess!

649
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,100
You turn your back.

650
01:14:05,420 --> 01:14:07,220
Give me a hand.

651
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:17,900
Yep, there it is!
It's been there all this time.

652
01:14:18,620 --> 01:14:21,420
Look at that,
here it is.

653
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:25,900
I didn't want it in the house.

654
01:14:26,820 --> 01:14:28,820
You won't tell Mum?

655
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,500
It's our secret.

656
01:14:44,300 --> 01:14:45,900
You've got the knack.

657
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:48,700
I've got strong arms.
When I was small...

658
01:14:50,220 --> 01:14:52,020
It's good, want some?

659
01:15:00,900 --> 01:15:07,020
It's my uncke's Calvados. Uncle Jean,
do you remember him?

660
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:10,620
Why did you go?

661
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:17,820
It wasn't nice leaving them just then.
You ran away.

662
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,820
-You ran away too.
-I was a kid.

663
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:25,900
I thought things might chance.

664
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,900
You like to travel?

665
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:32,900
I like stations,
at least I used to.

666
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:36,220
You wanted things to change?

667
01:15:36,500 --> 01:15:38,300
Couldn't care less.

668
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:48,300
We think women are weak,
they're strong.

669
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:51,220
Take my mother,
your grandmother...

670
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,300
I put her into a home...

671
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:58,700
I thought I'd feel bad about it
for ever....

672
01:15:59,020 --> 01:16:02,020
She'd die in a month.
Did she hell!

673
01:16:03,220 --> 01:16:04,700
She lived for years.

674
01:16:05,020 --> 01:16:07,500
She died at Christmas.

675
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:12,220
She married again,
left him everything.

676
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,220
Except the house.

677
01:16:24,620 --> 01:16:26,500
Why did she remarry?

678
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:32,300
People are afraid of solitude,
women especially.

679
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,500
They need someone...
to crack.

680
01:16:36,820 --> 01:16:37,820
And Mum?

681
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,700
You left her alone.

682
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:43,220
She had Nadine.

683
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:45,620
A tough nut.

684
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:54,900
Hide, mind the bottle!

685
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:29,420
We've become famous.
The grocer's was packed.

686
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:33,500
They'd have bought anything...

687
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,420
Listen, this is a family history.

688
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,220
Molto did great business.

689
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,700
They wouldn't budge,
they were curious.

690
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,500
"Your husband's back".
"With a monkey", I said.

691
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:52,500
And then, they didn't actually dare...

692
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:57,500
Finally, they said "And the little one?"
And I said "He's grown up."

693
01:17:57,820 --> 01:18:01,500
Your teacher came over and said:
"We must talk..."

694
01:18:02,220 --> 01:18:04,620
"Is it true that he...?"

695
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:10,220
And she whispered: "Is it true
what they wrote in the papers?"

696
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:21,500
I said, "I don't know". I was really
embarrassed. Unbelievable!

697
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:24,500
Anything wicked turns her on...

698
01:18:25,100 --> 01:18:29,420
Like the time Babette turned up in a
see-through bra...

699
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:33,620
...a g-string and garters!

700
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:36,420
Whatever next!

701
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,700
"No time to change"!

702
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:43,100
That's not when her mother...

703
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:44,900
...said it was your idea?

704
01:18:45,500 --> 01:18:49,220
It was. Babette does anything I say.

705
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:53,220
You're unbelievable.
You go too far.

706
01:18:59,700 --> 01:19:01,300
Forgive me for this morning?

707
01:19:08,900 --> 01:19:10,300
I love you.

708
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,700
I really love you.

709
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:25,300
It was just all rather sudden.

710
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:37,900
Where did they go?

711
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:41,620
You miss them?

712
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,300
Did they take the bike?

713
01:19:59,820 --> 01:20:01,820
Perhaps something's happened?

714
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:09,900
Mum, if life scared me that much,
I'd kill myself.

715
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:14,300
Don't push!

716
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:19,420
We paid some visits...

717
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:24,620
Listen to him sing,
listen to that accent!

718
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:24,020
Serge, you are not thinking straight.
You know you can't take liquor.

719
01:21:32,100 --> 01:21:33,420
Better?

720
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,820
Let me by.

721
01:21:57,020 --> 01:22:00,220
We must talk. I want to know...

722
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:01,900
You're drunk!

723
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:05,020
Why don't you like me?

724
01:22:05,900 --> 01:22:09,620
You've seduced them all,
even the monkey.

725
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:12,100
I don't have to like you.

726
01:22:12,900 --> 01:22:14,820
You think I'm not your brother?

727
01:22:15,020 --> 01:22:16,020
No.

728
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:18,420
You always hated me.

729
01:22:18,700 --> 01:22:22,700
-You wanted me to go.
-No. Olivier was different.

730
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:25,700
Why would I pretend to be your
brother?

731
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,500
I don't know.

732
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,820
See?

733
01:22:44,820 --> 01:22:46,100
Are you...

734
01:22:48,180 --> 01:22:50,180
Nadine!

735
01:22:50,220 --> 01:22:52,100
What happened?

736
01:22:52,780 --> 01:22:54,780
Nadine!

737
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:55,900
Take it!

738
01:23:31,220 --> 01:23:32,620
What's up?

739
01:23:37,420 --> 01:23:38,700
Shall I call Mum?

740
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:44,900
Stop!

741
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,500
Are you really crying?

742
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,820
Drink makes me cry.

743
01:24:03,100 --> 01:24:04,620
Why?

744
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:06,700
I don't know.

745
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,700
That's Dad's mum.

746
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:27,220
I had my appendix out two months
before I left.

747
01:24:28,420 --> 01:24:30,420
My favourite hat was red.

748
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:37,100
-My best friend was Jacques.
-You've had time to find out.

749
01:24:44,900 --> 01:24:46,100
Why are you laughing?

750
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:49,300
-And you?
-I'm laughing at you.

751
01:24:52,900 --> 01:24:55,020
You're nuts.

752
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,300
Don't go, please.

753
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:06,620
Tell me about Paris...
about how gays live.

754
01:25:09,220 --> 01:25:13,900
You tell me how did you that
in the bathroom.

755
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,020
Watch.

756
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,420
Nadine!

757
01:25:45,420 --> 01:25:47,420
Nadine!

758
01:25:57,900 --> 01:25:59,620
Have you gone crazy?

759
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:03,500
I was afraid on my own.

760
01:26:04,100 --> 01:26:05,820
Warm me up.

761
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:10,820
You smell nice.

762
01:26:13,620 --> 01:26:17,900
Have you been able to do that
long? With the lamp?

763
01:26:22,700 --> 01:26:27,820
When I was little,
after you went...

764
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,220
...I was often cross.

765
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:35,100
I'd tear my clothes,
bang my head.

766
01:26:36,100 --> 01:26:37,820
Stamp my feet.

767
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:44,020
One day I noticed I could move
things, istead.

768
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,700
I stopped the tantrums.

769
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,420
At that time...

770
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:02,620
...we were happy.

771
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:06,900
Mum was happy.

772
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,900
Now she'd say she was suicidal then.

773
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:19,220
She decieved me,
do you see?

774
01:27:22,420 --> 01:27:27,220
Ot's just words, suicide...
I did too.

775
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,100
She could have done it.

776
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,420
What?

777
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:39,620
You've got a hard-on.

778
01:27:41,900 --> 01:27:45,100
Don't go. Turn the other way.

779
01:28:13,500 --> 01:28:16,220
This is a gay kiss.

780
01:28:47,700 --> 01:28:49,620
What's this?

781
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:52,620
A sacrifice.

782
01:29:10,500 --> 01:29:13,820
I did't know it would be so nice
with a man.

783
01:29:14,900 --> 01:29:17,420
I'm a boy, not a man.

784
01:29:28,820 --> 01:29:35,300
You know what I do when I'm sick of
someone? I piss on him. Like this.

785
01:29:36,300 --> 01:29:38,620
Me too. Wait for me.

786
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:46,020
<i>Peepee on the grass</i>
<i>To bug the ladybirds</i>

787
01:29:54,300 --> 01:29:55,700
What's the time?

788
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,420
Just after four.

789
01:29:59,700 --> 01:30:01,220
I didn't wake up.

790
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,100
Do you remember Oliver's
peeing contests?

791
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,220
Peeing contests?

792
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:13,420
He was so proud of himself.
Marcel taught him, do you remember?

793
01:30:16,420 --> 01:30:22,020
No. I don't remember.
Peeing?

794
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:30,700
It is him. It's Olivier!

795
01:30:32,420 --> 01:30:35,220
You didn't want to believe?

796
01:30:41,220 --> 01:30:43,020
My little girl!

797
01:30:45,820 --> 01:30:50,620
What did you write?
Let me guess.

798
01:30:51,900 --> 01:30:56,100
I love you.

799
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,420
I love you too.

800
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:06,300
You never understand.

801
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:33,420
Marcel!

802
01:31:43,220 --> 01:31:45,420
Marcel! I'm Olivier!

803
01:31:47,220 --> 01:31:50,900
Got any fags? The shop's shut.

804
01:31:53,900 --> 01:31:55,900
Marcel!

805
01:32:23,820 --> 01:32:26,300
I was going home, he called me...

806
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:30,420
He said he had something for me,
then...

807
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,500
It's over now. It'll be O.K..

808
01:32:33,900 --> 01:32:36,220
He said we'd play the trumpet.

809
01:32:36,900 --> 01:32:39,620
He won't hurt you now.

810
01:33:08,420 --> 01:33:10,020
Let's go to Paris?

811
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:13,020
Now, on thw bike?
Super!

812
01:34:00,420 --> 01:34:02,500
Your 'phone off the hook?

813
01:34:03,620 --> 01:34:06,820
Here, I've brought you a present.

814
01:34:07,900 --> 01:34:09,820
The kid wants the loo.

815
01:34:14,220 --> 01:34:16,020
What's this about?

816
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:23,420
What's up now? Scarpered again?
Who's the kid?

817
01:34:23,820 --> 01:34:26,500
Remember Marcel, the neighbour?

818
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,420
The last person to see...

819
01:34:32,700 --> 01:34:34,420
He's pervert.

820
01:34:34,820 --> 01:34:37,700
He had the kid,
it was a miracle I turned up.

821
01:34:38,420 --> 01:34:41,020
I came here because...

822
01:34:43,020 --> 01:34:45,300
I think he did the same thing
to Olivier.

823
01:34:47,900 --> 01:34:49,700
You mean?

824
01:34:51,500 --> 01:34:52,820
It wasn't me.

825
01:34:54,820 --> 01:34:57,900
I'm not the real one.

826
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:02,820
Shit, don't you see?

827
01:35:04,100 --> 01:35:06,020
I'm not the real one!

828
01:35:21,700 --> 01:35:23,100
I'm not the real one.

829
01:35:23,420 --> 01:35:25,820
O.K., I get the point.

830
01:35:46,220 --> 01:35:49,220
I thought cops would live...

831
01:35:49,700 --> 01:35:51,420
Better than this?

832
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:55,020
I'm not a successful cop.

833
01:35:55,900 --> 01:35:59,020
You were my first success.

834
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:01,700
Finish eating.

835
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:04,900
What should I do?

836
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:08,700
What should I do?

837
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:17,700
First we call the kid's parents.

838
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:22,900
And then the Duvals,
tell them you're here.

839
01:36:23,700 --> 01:36:26,900
Then we'll set wheels in motion.

840
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:34,820
I think you should stay put.

841
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,900
-I was thinking...
- Thinking what?

842
01:36:41,820 --> 01:36:47,420
I was thinking we needn't tell them...
they needn't know.

843
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,900
She couldn't take it.

844
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:54,220
Mum, Madame Duval.

845
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,020
Not so fast!

846
01:36:56,300 --> 01:36:59,220
You can't go on pretending
to be her son?

847
01:37:00,220 --> 01:37:03,700
No, that's true. Though, I thought...

848
01:37:06,620 --> 01:37:09,820
-Why did you do that?
-What?

849
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:14,820
Why did you pretend?

850
01:37:16,100 --> 01:37:18,900
It was what you wanted, wasn't it?

851
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:23,420
It was to please you.

852
01:37:47,700 --> 01:37:49,300
**********

853
01:38:26,900 --> 01:38:31,220
I swear, I just wanted to touch him.

854
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:36,700
He was afraid, he wanted to run away.

855
01:38:37,100 --> 01:38:40,700
The door was open,
he fell down the steps.

856
01:38:43,620 --> 01:38:49,500
He didn't move at all,
I had to do something.

857
01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:56,420
Afterwards... I saw his bike
and his hat.

858
01:38:57,500 --> 01:38:59,300
I buried them.

859
01:39:01,700 --> 01:39:06,500
I didn't know what to do...
I wanted to forget.

860
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:11,420
It wasn't my fault.

861
01:39:13,420 --> 01:39:15,300
I liked him.

862
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:22,300
And her... Elisabeth.

863
01:39:25,020 --> 01:39:30,820
So when, when he came back
it was as if I'd gone mad.

864
01:39:31,220 --> 01:39:34,700
As if someone...
it's not my fault.

865
01:39:41,420 --> 01:39:44,100
Could ou come here?

866
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,020
Careful!

867
01:40:03,900 --> 01:40:05,820
I felt something.

868
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:14,220
Father!

869
01:40:15,620 --> 01:40:17,500
Don't worry.

870
01:40:48,020 --> 01:40:50,020
You've got your truth.

871
01:40:50,900 --> 01:40:52,820
Is it what you wanted?

872
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:29,900
-Land, Mum, I'm here.
-Olivier...

873
01:41:35,100 --> 01:41:37,300
You're back?
