1
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,954
Before my father died, he said
the worst thing about growing old...

2
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,749
... was that other men stopped
seeing you as dangerous.

3
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,558
I've always remembered that...

4
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:52,358
... how being dangerous
was sacred, a badge of honor.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,878
You live your life
by a code, an ethos.

6
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:02,910
Every man does. It's your shoreline.
It's what guides you home.

7
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,635
And trust me, you're always
trying to get home.

8
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,710
Authorities say the ring
is centered in Costa Rica...

9
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,393
... with the primary export being...

10
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,869
... widely unknown if the war
on drugs is connecting them with...

11
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,909
... in the region have been
known to retaliate using a...

12
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,199
... 25,000 troops...

13
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,958
... flying from the US
to control that...

14
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,598
Can we get some ice cream?

15
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,274
- No, we gotta go.
- You always say no.

16
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,398
- Well, are you gonna buy?
- No, you buy.

17
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,959
Okay, what are we getting today?

18
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:49,436
- Passion fruit.
- Okay, passion fruit.

19
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,474
How about macadamia nut?

20
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,912
... claimed responsibility
for the attack...

21
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,872
... at the International School
in Manila.

22
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,559
Your father was a reader.

23
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,838
Churchill, of course, but also
Faulkner and books about Tecumseh.

24
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,874
He loved artists who painted people
with bodies that looked like boxes.

25
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,837
I'd give him hell about that.

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,831
He'd just say,
"You gotta look harder."

27
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,638
Ambassador Margullies had long
been a strong supporter...

28
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,997
... of joint counterterrorism operations
conducted within this region.

29
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,789
Not one group has yet claimed
responsibility for the attacks...

30
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,869
... on the International School.

31
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,792
- Here's your coffee, Rorke.
- Thank you, ma'am.

32
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,871
- How's it going?
- Hey, you want the usual?

33
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,349
- Sounds good, thank you.
- You're late again, Dave.

34
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,552
I didn't say anything.

35
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,836
What do you got
going on over here?

36
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,551
- Are you serious, man?
- We're not telling anyone yet.

37
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,253
You a little nervous though, huh?

38
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,753
Well, last time I checked,
they don't come with directions.

39
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,353
Yeah, tell me about it.

40
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,430
- Hey.
- Hey.

41
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,318
My man here is having a baby.

42
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,755
Hey, congratulations.

43
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,876
Hey, everybody,
Rorke's having a baby.

44
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,358
- Congratulations, Rorke!
- Whoo!

45
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,279
- What did I just say?
- Ah... don't worry about it, man.

46
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
You're gonna be awesome.

47
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,393
I'm so excited for you, man.
You're gonna be a good dad.

48
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,518
Hey, tomorrow Jackie and I
are heading down to the beach.

49
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,631
Bring Sandy and the kids.
I'll bring an extra board for you.

50
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,870
You know I don't surf.

51
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,070
I know you don't surf,
but it'll be good...

52
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,514
- ... to get the families together.
- All right.

53
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,475
But now that you've told
everyone in the bar...

54
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,275
... try and contain
yourself tomorrow.

55
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,348
I will try.

56
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,228
"Look harder,"
your father would say.

57
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,949
I always knew he wasn't just talking
about those boxy abstract paintings.

58
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,793
There's threats everywhere, and
the world is draped in camouflage.

59
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,829
Hey, I'll be right down, all right?

60
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,434
Whatever you say, Boss.

61
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,509
How was the ride?

62
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,153
I left Colombia this morning.

63
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,199
- Colombia to here in one day?
- Piece of cake.

64
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,896
Anyway, estimates say that
Christo is worth close to a billion.

65
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,895
That's with a "B"?

66
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,399
Yeah, and he gives back a lot
to this community over here...

67
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,995
... with medical clinics,
schools, political donations...

68
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,559
... you name it,
so this is the deal.

69
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,551
They are extremely
loyal to him over here.

70
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,188
When did the DEA
hand him over to us?

71
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,909
When they intercepted a 707
of his filled with Soviet weapons.

72
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,395
Listen, Langley says that
the boys over at NSA...

73
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,393
... they found some interesting
intercepts connecting Christo...

74
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,028
... to a jihadist network
out of Southeast Asia.

75
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,237
Apparently, Christo and one
of the guys running the network...

76
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,833
... they're childhood friends.

77
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,116
Your father's grandfather
gave up his life...

78
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,840
... flying a B-24 in World War II.

79
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,037
He kept the Liberator aloft just
long enough for everyone to jump...

80
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,430
... and then he went down
with the plane.

81
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,836
That's the blood
that courses in your veins.

82
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,917
- Daddy, can I come with you?
- You wanna come with me?

83
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,833
Did you feel how cold it is out there?
I'll tell you what...

84
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,639
... go hang out with Mommy for a
little while, help out with the baby.

85
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,788
When I come back in,
if you still want to go out...

86
00:08:40,829 --> 00:08:41,798
... I'll take you out with me.

87
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,752
- Promise?
- I promise. Hurry up, go.

88
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,551
- What's going on, sir?
- What's up, brother?

89
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,200
Nothing much, man.

90
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,797
Now, I know you got
the New York heritage...

91
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,269
... but this isn't exactly like
sitting back in Staten Island.

92
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,396
You gotta actually work hard
to get through the surf.

93
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,999
- Yeah, I know.
- Twelve-plus years on the Teams...

94
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,354
... and you don't know
how to do this?

95
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,357
Hey, wait till you
have five kids, man.

96
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,437
You'll see how much time
you got to play in the surf.

97
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,158
You ready to get
in the drink or what?

98
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,634
All right, man, lead the way.

99
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,677
- All right, don't embarrass us.
- All right.

100
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,913
Your father was my Boss,
and I was his Chief.

101
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:20,968
What we knew about each other
strengthened our bond as operators.

102
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,197
There was a brotherhood
between us...

103
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,158
... and we depended on each
other more than a family.

104
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,791
Tecumseh said, "Although
a single twig will break...

105
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,076
... a bundle of twigs is strong."

106
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,437
Okay, okay, gracias.

107
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,716
Wow, this is unbelievable.

108
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,016
I still can't believe you
ordered Chinese in this place.

109
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,389
It's really good.

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,194
Double word score, 18 points.

111
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,676
- "Dumb"?
- Read it and weep, sugar.

112
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,433
I'll try not to.

113
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,717
Look at this, look at this.
Thirty-eight points for me.

114
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,996
"Adumbrating,"
that's not even a word.

115
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,276
Okay, first of all,
it's pronounced "adumbrating"...

116
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,079
... and it means pretending,
foreshadowing.

117
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,392
Hmm...

118
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,709
Guess who's buying dinner
tonight, sugar.

119
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,016
Fine.

120
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,236
In most cases,
officers get tactical partners.

121
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,029
Langley sets me up with some
sort of Scrabble hustler.

122
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,878
Scrabble Yoda, okay?
Get it right.

123
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,273
- How much do I owe you?
- Nada.

124
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,389
Shit.

125
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,593
Our platoon
was headed downrange.

126
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,558
We had Weimy, our sniper.

127
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,678
He grew up in the middle
of the Mojave Desert.

128
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,613
Most excitement he found as
a kid was bowling frozen turkeys...

129
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,955
... down the aisle
at the grocery store.

130
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,512
Ray, our comms guy,
our radioman...

131
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,274
... he grew up in East LA gangland.

132
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,718
He had a Silver Star for pulling
a wounded teammate out of the fray.

133
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,633
Sonny, he was made of granite.

134
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,631
This guy didn't even
do push-ups...

135
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,951
... 'cause he was afraid
his chest was gonna get too big.

136
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,317
Ajay joined the Teams
late in his 30s.

137
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,710
He'd been a Muay Thai fighter
early in life.

138
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,997
Before that, he grew up
dirt-poor in Trinidad.

139
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,230
Mikey had 20 years in the Teams.

140
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,994
But as humble as he was,
you'd never even know it.

141
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,192
He kept a picture
of his wife in his helmet...

142
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,392
... and a lock of her hair
in his pocket.

143
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,437
Quiet as the breeze.

144
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,172
And finally, Senior Chief.

145
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,769
I couldn't really
tell you much about him...

146
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,025
... other than I'd rather
take a knife into a gunfight...

147
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,098
... than have to be
interrogated by him.

148
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,697
That last night at home...

149
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,135
... you think about how you could
have been a better dad...

150
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,131
... a better husband.

151
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,134
That bedtime story you should have
read or that anniversary you forgot.

152
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,053
You don't expect your family
to understand what you're doing.

153
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,972
You just hope they'll accept it.

154
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:13,053
When you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off.

155
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,288
What's up?

156
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,977
- You putting the wild bunch down?
- Yeah, yeah.

157
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,835
Hey, Senior, you mind giving
us a couple of minutes, man?

158
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,130
- Nah, you got 'em, Jefe.
- Thanks.

159
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,698
Hey, fellas, you know
I only got so many speeches...

160
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,977
... in a given work-up
or deployment, but, uh...

161
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,855
... it's like Chief and I said right
at the beginning of this platoon.

162
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,609
Once we step off on campaign, once
this bird's ready and we're downrange...

163
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,089
... everything back home
needs to be in balance.

164
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,978
We're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves...

165
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,778
... if we get over there
and something's out of whack.

166
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,711
I mean, if things
aren't right with the family...

167
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,778
... things aren't right with the
finances or something's off...

168
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,471
... it's gonna put us
all out of balance, so...

169
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,171
... we need to have that tight
before we launch.

170
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,171
If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.

171
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,177
Chief can take care of it,
I can take care of it.

172
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,377
Everybody's got each other's back.

173
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,174
Let's make sure we lock that down
so when we're ready to roll...

174
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,376
... all our focus
is on the mission.

175
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,635
For all those who have
been downrange...

176
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,236
... to us and those like us,
damn few.

177
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,277
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

178
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,153
I still like the name James.

179
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,993
I'll think about it, if it's a boy.

180
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,349
Come here.

181
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,718
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, baby.

182
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,995
Hey, little one, you make sure you
keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.

183
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,196
I don't like that
chain-smoking at all.

184
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,759
I got it, Lieutenant.

185
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,319
- Okay.
- It's gonna be okay.

186
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,417
- All right.
- It's gonna be fine.

187
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,469
Try to keep this as long
as you can for a while, yeah?

188
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,993
Anything else, Commander?

189
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,109
Yeah. I'd like to be able to look into
your eyes when our first child is born.

190
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,316
You know I'll do my best.

191
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,197
I love you, baby.

192
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,549
Love you.

193
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,196
War is a country of will.

194
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,510
There's no room for sympathy.

195
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:43,456
If you're not willing to give up
everything, you've already lost.

196
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,451
Tell me, what is it about
you Americans that makes...

197
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,080
... you feel entitled to fuck
with the way I make my living?

198
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,592
I know who you are, Miss Morales,
and I know who you work for.

199
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,109
So why don't you
save us both some time...

200
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:39,635
... and tell me exactly
what you think you know?

201
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,351
How did that feel, Miss Morales?

202
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,875
Have a great day at the spa.

203
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,771
Si, Jefe.

204
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,753
- Hey, fellas, what's up?
- Hey.

205
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,753
It's hotter than two rats screwing
in a wool sock out there, yeah?

206
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,990
Africa-hot... Tarzan
couldn't take this heat.

207
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,991
Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.

208
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,790
Lights.
Three days ago, two CIA agents...

209
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,618
... a Walter Ross and
a Miss Lisa Morales...

210
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,558
... were ambushed inside their
hotel room here in Costa Rica...

211
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,876
... by a unknown amount
of heavily armed assholes.

212
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,919
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Miss Morales has been abducted.

213
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,116
We believe that
this has been the work...

214
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,840
... of a guy named Mikhail
Troykavitch, aka Christo.

215
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,956
LT's going to give you
the skinny on him.

216
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,749
Thanks, Senior.
Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.

217
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,832
This guy is believed to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals...

218
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,949
... between the Russian mafia,
the FARC guerrillas...

219
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,517
... and the Mexican drug cartels
ever since the late 1990s.

220
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:26,195
Now, before she was captured,
Morales was working a possible link...

221
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,114
... between our boy Christo
and this guy Abu Shabal.

222
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,630
Glory to Allah,
Lord of the worlds...

223
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,318
... who has created us
as Muslims...

224
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,631
... and delivered us with
the Jihad on his direct path.

225
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,311
Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.

226
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,199
Let me explain this
to you Americans.

227
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,078
We are not separatists.

228
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,198
We Chechens are not
a legal part of anyone...

229
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,911
... but you Americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting...

230
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,790
... in the genocide of our people by
demanding that we obey certain rules...

231
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,397
... and by your continued
occupation of all Muslim countries.

232
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,348
With the grace of Allah,
glorious and exalted is he...

233
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,356
... America will never be safe until
safety becomes a reality for us.

234
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,636
Allahu Akbar.

235
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,910
Abu Shabal
is a Chechen terrorist...

236
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,389
... who's associated with
the Beslan School Massacre.

237
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,599
He's been jumping between training
camps in Indonesia and the Philippines.

238
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,330
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy...

239
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,073
... but if this was the lead
that Morales was working on...

240
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,674
... it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?

241
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,559
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss Morales.

242
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,352
All right, who's got questions?

243
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,750
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source intel...

244
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,593
... on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

245
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,672
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

246
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,612
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there...

247
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,750
... walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.

248
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,269
Senior, what kind of
weapons-on-target are we looking at?

249
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,456
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers...

250
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,836
... so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

251
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,753
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

252
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,937
So if there is a weapons'
emplacement up there...

253
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,137
... I suggest you guys
bring rockets.

254
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Of course, rockets and foliage
don't match...

255
00:20:08,001 --> 00:20:09,749
... so make sure
you got a clear shot.

256
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,095
All right, what else?

257
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,595
Any idea whether
she's ambulatory or not?

258
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,273
There was a ton of blood
on the scene...

259
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,869
... and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.

260
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,077
Miss Morales may have bled there
too, but these guys are savages...

261
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,794
... so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory...

262
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,269
... so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

263
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,791
Two minutes to drop.

264
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,634
Hey, LT.

265
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,997
You gotta let us know who
that guy is, so when we get back...

266
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,527
... we can kick his ass.

267
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,037
What guy?

268
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,714
The guy that gave you
that fucked-up haircut.

269
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,033
- Fuck.
- Damn, Sonny.

270
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,497
You should be the last guy to talk.
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

271
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,772
That means my head shines
like your gold teeth, huh?

272
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,756
Don't be like that.

273
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,750
- That's harsh.
- Ramp!

274
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,512
Mask up.

275
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,000
Man, I tell you what.

276
00:21:17,001 --> 00:21:19,838
The only thing better than this
right here is being a dad...

277
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,468
... except for that whole
changing diaper thing, but...

278
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,756
... Sandy does that
for me anyway, so...

279
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,717
I'm actually looking forward to it.

280
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,360
Blackbeard, green light in ten.

281
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,673
Five.

282
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,110
Blackbeard Main, Blackbeard Main,
this is Blackbeard Actual.

283
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,759
Radio check.
Over.

284
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:22,876
Blackbeard Main, Blackbeard Main,
this is Blackbeard Actual. Over.

285
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,958
Roger, Actual.
This is Main.

286
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,795
- We have you, Lima Charlie.
- Roger, Main.

287
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,475
All boots are on the ground.
I pass T-bird.

288
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,489
Any traffic for my station
at this time?

289
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,193
Actual, imagery picked up
an increase in traffic...

290
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,079
... at secondary location,
known to be enemy QRF...

291
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,151
... eight clicks from primary target.

292
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:48,834
The SWCC boats will insert
at 0600 for your extract.

293
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,753
- How copy?
- Roger, Main.

294
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,916
- You ready?
- Roger that, sir.

295
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,072
We got about 4.7 clicks
at three-five-five.

296
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,629
Take it out.

297
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,071
Whiplash, one minute out.

298
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,679
Thirty seconds.

299
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,273
Ten by ten.

300
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,454
Whiplash, go.

301
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,952
All boots on deck.

302
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,069
Line secure.

303
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,956
Whiplash, Bucket One
and Two are out.

304
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,749
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.
Radio check. Over.

305
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,957
Blackbeard, it's Whiplash.
Have you loud and clear.

306
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,593
Standing by on the set.

307
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,353
Roger, Whiplash.
What is your ETA to my pos?

308
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,317
ETA 20 mikes.

309
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,359
Be advised, Raven is in flight
and pushing to your location.

310
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,932
No!

311
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,113
No!

312
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,318
Hey, sir, we gotta go.

313
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,191
Roger.
Take it out.

314
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,193
I feel like we're pretty thin.
I'd like to take you guys with us.

315
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,114
Chief, I got a SBT coming up on-step.
I got a Raven pushing my pos.

316
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,713
Weimy and I are in good
overwatch position...

317
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,791
... and I got to keep reporting
back to Blackbeard Main.

318
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,871
- We're staying here.
- Roger that.

319
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,279
- Keep it tight.
- Got it.

320
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,932
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.

321
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,032
Assault force is moving
to the target early.

322
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,978
Request immediate fire support.

323
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,748
Blackbeard, it's Whiplash.
Good copy.

324
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,754
Requesting fire support.
Pushing to your location in 15 mikes.

325
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,833
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.
I have positive control of the Raven.

326
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,332
Chief, are you set?

327
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,349
Chief, Chief, hold it.

328
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,558
One o'clock, base of the tower.

329
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,878
You're clear to the door.

330
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,438
I've got two squirters
coming out the back door.

331
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,989
Going in!

332
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,750
- Clear!
- All clear!

333
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,670
Weimy, eleven o'clock.
Driver's side, truck.

334
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,832
Got him.

335
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:37,900
Fuck.

336
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,499
- Come on.
- Go in! Go in!

337
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,117
- Clear!
- All clear!

338
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,431
- Target secure.
- Chief, I'm going to get Mikey.

339
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,473
LT, this is Chief.
Target is secure.

340
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,438
Stand by for confirmation
of the package.

341
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:21,957
Be advised, Mikey is down.
Mikey is down. Status to follow.

342
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,832
Roger.
You have the package.

343
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,630
Chief, I got his cell phone.

344
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,759
LT, LT.

345
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:46,980
Chief, looks like you have
two aggressor vehicles...

346
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,483
... approaching from the north,
about one mike out.

347
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,231
You can take the truck
outside the west door.

348
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,010
Meet us at extract.

349
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,513
Miss Morales,
I'm bringing you home.

350
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,636
I just need to ask you
a few questions.

351
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,509
What's your mother's
maiden name?

352
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,359
Rosales.

353
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,476
What street you were born on?

354
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,390
Hot Springs.

355
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,030
All right.
Just hang on.

356
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,394
Whiplash, we have enemy QRF
approaching from the north.

357
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,394
Roger. You have enemy QRF
coming in from the north.

358
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,676
Chief, you need
to start your exfil now.

359
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,354
- We'll meet you at secondary extract.
- Roger that.

360
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,232
Hey, boys, we gotta roll!

361
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,880
Shit. Sir, it's those trucks
about 1,000 yards.

362
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:33,559
Yep.

363
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,072
Ma'am, I'm taking you out.

364
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,596
Hey, Chief, he took a round to the eye
with the exit wound behind the ear.

365
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,035
He's alive, but we gotta
get moving now!

366
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,392
Weimy, coming out.

367
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,352
We'll meet you at the rally point.

368
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,596
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it!

369
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,751
- Heads up! Fast movement on the left!
- Right turn! Right turn!

370
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,516
Hey, man, we're not going
to make it to secondary extract.

371
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,557
I got to find us a route.
Stay on this road.

372
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,598
- Left, left, left.
- Left turn! Left turn!

373
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,113
Mikey, come on, buddy.

374
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,353
Hey, Chief!

375
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,270
We're not gonna
make secondary extract!

376
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,423
You're gonna have to
figure it out, man!

377
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,273
Hold on!

378
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,396
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

379
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,155
Stay with us.

380
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,298
Come on, Mike. Wake up.
Wake up. Come on, man.

381
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,438
- Contact!
- Pick it up, pick it up.

382
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,068
Yo, Chief!
We can make it to rally point!

383
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,516
- Sounds good! Pass it to LT!
- Come on, man.

384
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,559
LT, LT, this is assault team.
We just lost the secondary extract.

385
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,109
I say again, we just lost
secondary extract.

386
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,038
Moving to rally point.
How copy, over?

387
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,912
- We're about a click out.
- Mikey, wake up.

388
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,869
One click out!

389
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,870
Let's go, Mike.
Wake up. Come on, buddy.

390
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,469
Come on, Mikey!
Wake up!

391
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,078
- Good?
- Backstage clear.

392
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,914
Rocket out!

393
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,638
He's not breathing!

394
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,597
- Breathe, Mikey!
- We're up! We're up!

395
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,111
Chief, let me get your M-4!

396
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,671
Sir, what's the status
on those boats?

397
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,552
I lost Whiplash on the run.

398
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,672
Told 'em you hit the target early.
They're coming in hot.

399
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,877
- Roger that.
- Fuck! Take this, man.

400
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,189
Breathe, Mikey.
Come on, Mikey.

401
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,496
- I got no pulse.
- Contact rear!

402
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,589
Contact rear!

403
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,989
- Holy shit!
- Taking rounds in.

404
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,230
Pick it up, pick it up.

405
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,050
Ajay!
QRF coming up the rear!

406
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,192
Whiplash! Whiplash!
Secondary extract is burnt.

407
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,038
Moving to tertiary extract.

408
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,112
I have eight packs,
seven Sierras, one package.

409
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,748
Package with multiple wounds.

410
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,154
The Sierra has gunshot wound
to the head.

411
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,390
This will be a hot extract.

412
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,159
What the fuck?

413
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,912
- Oh, shit!
- Mikey, stay down!

414
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,150
- Keep him down, man!
- Where the fuck am I?

415
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,073
- Calm down, brother.
- Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

416
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,198
Stay down, brother. Calm.
Be easy. We're almost out of here.

417
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,429
We're almost out of here.

418
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,559
Mikey!

419
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,199
- Hang on, buddy.
- Where are we?

420
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,078
- We're on our way to extract.
- What happened?

421
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,032
You're good to go.
You took one to the face, man.

422
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,259
You're a hard motherfucker.

423
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,395
- Did we get her?
- Yes.

424
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,834
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way to extract.

425
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,395
Ajay, splash it.
Splash it.

426
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,632
Water! Water!
Water!

427
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,675
Going in!
Going in!

428
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,715
I got her!
I got her!

429
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,995
It's fucking going under.

430
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,832
Out!
Get the fuck out!

431
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,999
It wasn't for nothing.

432
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:28,232
You know, from time to time...

433
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,088
... I get to see my old friends
from my old life.

434
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,271
And it's always,
always disappointing.

435
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:41,120
Some become assholes,
others boring...

436
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,317
... and I can't believe I tried to get
them in bed all those years ago.

437
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,831
Hey.

438
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,930
It is nice not to be
disappointed, Yuri.

439
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,710
- That's not my name.
- I know.

440
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,230
Mohammed Abu Shabal,
the son of Shabal.

441
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,298
Come on.
Your father's name is Yevgeny.

442
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:08,559
Things change.

443
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,192
Yeah, things have changed.

444
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,636
That's why this is the last time
we might have to see each other...

445
00:47:14,637 --> 00:47:15,636
... for quite some time.

446
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,917
For I might have
to find a hole to hide in.

447
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,519
I don't understand.

448
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,693
I'm being watched by the CIA,
and I'm not taking any chances.

449
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,435
As soon as the opportunity presents
itself, I'm taking my family south.

450
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,750
I neither have the energy
or the will to fight the Americans.

451
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,593
What about our deal, Mikhail?

452
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,194
My men have been training
for almost a year now.

453
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:43,318
- I have devoted much of my...
- The deal stands, Yuri.

454
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,630
Just because I've taken early
retirement does not mean...

455
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,114
... I'm not holding up
my end of the bargain.

456
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,269
There is so much to be done.

457
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:51,193
And it will be, just without me.

458
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,918
You'll have to use
my trusted associates.

459
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,798
That's not so good for me.

460
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,188
- Hey...
- Hey! Shut up!

461
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,035
Shut up!

462
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,589
Stop your fucking bullshit!

463
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,558
It's not good. Doesn't work.
You can't change it like that.

464
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,553
- Nothing changes. Nothing.
- You just told me everything's changed.

465
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,433
What... what is that?
What is that?

466
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:10,477
Do you know
what I do to get here?

467
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,074
Do you know the men who
I've had to sacrifice to get here?

468
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,555
Do you have any idea?

469
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,790
No, you shit! You live up here
in this ivory tower!

470
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,996
You have no... you don't care!

471
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,320
Hey, Chief, what's the status
on Mikey?

472
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,036
He's definitely gonna lose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.

473
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,671
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.

474
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,354
Great job smoke-checking those
assholes and getting Morales back.

475
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,512
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta
tell you what, that was solid work.

476
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,821
So, Chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.

477
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,129
- You hear me?
- Check.

478
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:01,988
All right. Now, Morales,
Morales was one tough chick...

479
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,469
... but she should've gotten
the stuff up the chain a lot faster...

480
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:06,790
... because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.

481
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,231
How is that? I thought this was
a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.

482
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,006
Yeah, it was until
we got into that phone...

483
00:49:12,007 --> 00:49:13,836
... that you guys picked up
in that shithole.

484
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,639
It turned me on to something
that just does not look right at all.

485
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,712
- And what's not right about it?
- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer...

486
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,553
... than I thought they were,
and Shabal is a wild card, man.

487
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,429
He is an old-school jihadi
that couldn't give a rat's ass...

488
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:26,429
... about money or drugs.

489
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:28,716
Yeah, and his childhood friend,
Christo, the dope dealer?

490
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,270
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.

491
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,716
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.

492
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,552
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

493
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,871
Christo knows how to get
fuckers inside America.

494
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,355
This could be big trouble
in little China, fellas.

495
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,033
They're gonna hit us at home.

496
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,520
I just got done talking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force...

497
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,033
... and this is what's
gonna go down.

498
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:53,953
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to launch for an SR in two hours.

499
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:56,395
They're gonna get some frequent
flyer miles on the way to Africa.

500
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,959
Why Africa?

501
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,395
We pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got...

502
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,039
and I think that Shabal
is gonna be there...

503
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:04,539
... doing a weapons transfer
on his way west.

504
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,360
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?

505
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:11,872
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.

506
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,951
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.

507
00:50:14,120 --> 00:50:15,196
You'll be the primary
assault force...

508
00:50:15,210 --> 00:50:17,396
... in case something goes down
anywhere near America.

509
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,357
- Check.
- Check.

510
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,476
You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?

511
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:25,918
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

512
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,951
So I'm gonna link up
with SEAL Team Four...

513
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,315
... and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.

514
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,948
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and palm trees for me, baby.

515
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:34,075
Yeah, brother.
Go get him.

516
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,434
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.

517
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,591
Good luck with that baby,
Lieutenant.

518
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,115
- Does everybody know?
- Only the important people.

519
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,669
The important people to who?
You?

520
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,479
I guess so.

521
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,598
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.

522
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,196
Hey, brother, I've never
written one of these before.

523
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,184
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir.
I am.

524
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,798
But to be honest with you...

525
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:03,236
... I was thinking of calling the
command and trying to get you home.

526
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,055
But now that work's
picked up so much...

527
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,155
... I feel like we really
need you here.

528
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,038
You remember our
last cruise to Al Anbar?

529
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,131
- Yeah.
- When you had that final...

530
00:51:13,150 --> 00:51:15,589
... turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?

531
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,436
I was laying in bed and
I realized the only thing...

532
00:51:17,454 --> 00:51:19,236
... I needed to do now
was go home.

533
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,073
But if something
went south on your op...

534
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,356
... I would always regret
not being there with you.

535
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,988
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave.

536
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,832
But I'm working some things
with the brass.

537
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,879
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

538
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:36,157
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.

539
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:39,557
But, if it doesn't, I'm gonna
take this piece of paper...

540
00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:42,017
... and I'm gonna make it
into a nice paper airplane.

541
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,638
Beat it.

542
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,037
We're good, we're good!

543
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,516
Chief of the Watch, submerge
the ship to one-six-zero feet.

544
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,477
Dive.
Dive.

545
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,433
Scope down.
All doors are green.

546
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,118
- Oh, good. Hey, guys.
- Sir.

547
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,599
- Thank you for getting here so fast.
- Sure.

548
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:23,392
- Grab a seat, please.
- Thank you.

549
00:53:23,560 --> 00:53:25,118
You'll have Bulldog overhead.

550
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,271
We need you to get in,
grab the intel...

551
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,432
... and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?

552
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,279
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.

553
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,471
What if the meeting doesn't
take place as scheduled?

554
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,870
How long do you
want us to stay on target?

555
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,794
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan
on being out there for a while.

556
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:44,110
- Check.
- Are we good?

557
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,469
- Think so, sir.
- Yes, sir.

558
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,155
Ray and Ajay are rigged up
and ready to check each other out.

559
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,633
Garage door clear.

560
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,993
- You got a visual?
- Yeah.

561
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:22,037
Got three trucks moving in.

562
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:26,159
A fuel truck, two jeeps,
some skinnies in the back.

563
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,958
One of them has a .50-cal.

564
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,335
Do you hear that?

565
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,595
- Yeah, I think that's our plane.
- Yeah, we got some inbound.

566
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,910
'Bout time these guys showed up.
Jesus. Let me get my camera.

567
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:15,838
Hey, Ray, we got two birds
down at the end of the field...

568
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,074
... southeast our pos, no tail IDs.

569
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:23,879
- You got that?
- Check, no tail IDs.

570
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,913
Ray, last time I checked,
we were in Africa, right?

571
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,878
Yeah.
Why, what's up?

572
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,989
Dude, there's, like,
16 Filipinos down there...

573
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,593
... all praying to Mecca right now.

574
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:47,558
- Filipinos?
- Filipinos. Definitely not skinnies.

575
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,837
I'm picking up the praying.
I'm also picking up some Russian.

576
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:25,669
Bulldog, Bulldog, Redrum,
radio check, over.

577
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:28,149
- Good check, copy.
- Roger, good check.

578
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,231
Be advised, we got
two sterile aircraft...

579
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,109
... departing to the east
from following location...

580
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,158
... Ten, Papa, Lima, Sierra.

581
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,595
Please advise
when tally target, over.

582
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,196
Roger. Copy, two aircraft,
location Ten, Papa...

583
00:57:43,360 --> 00:57:46,675
Hey, Chief, you are not
gonna believe this.

584
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,473
One of the planes
Ray and Ajay tagged...

585
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,870
... just landed on Cedros Island
off the coast of Mexico.

586
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,032
It has Shabal on it with an
unknown number of jihadis.

587
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:55,434
Are you kidding me?

588
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,352
No, looks like we're gonna
get to hit that target.

589
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,556
Well, Senior and the SWCC
boats are punching out.

590
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,439
They should pull a little more
intel for us, so we'll see.

591
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,079
All right.

592
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:34,032
I don't know how long we're staying.
Hold on, baby.

593
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,476
- Be safe.
- You know I will.

594
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:44,108
- I gotta go, honey.
- I love you.

595
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:46,111
I love you.

596
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:33,437
Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out.

597
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,671
Bravo, you have a Tango
on your starboard side.

598
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,512
Tango on the starboard side.

599
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,394
Whiskey Charlie,
we have a visual on Tango.

600
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,390
Bravo, you have a Viper
at twelve o'clock.

601
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,233
Get down!
Get down!

602
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:56,234
Clear!
Bridge secure.

603
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,279
Senior, you're clear.

604
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,640
- English okay? Let's do that.
- English is fine.

605
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:39,518
Can you cut him loose, please?

606
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,671
If you get cut loose, you're not
gonna do anything crazy, are you?

607
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,031
- A Crazy Ivan?
- So to speak.

608
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,475
So you're Russian, yeah?

609
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:50,148
- Yes, I am.
- Are you all right?

610
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,834
- Yes, I'm good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

611
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,353
I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.

612
01:01:54,560 --> 01:01:55,595
- I'm Otto.
- Otto.

613
01:01:55,760 --> 01:01:57,478
- Yes. And you are?
- Nice to meet you.

614
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:58,675
Christo.

615
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,592
- Crisco?
- Christo.

616
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,517
Troskawicz?

617
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,736
So how long am I gonna need
to keep busting your balls...

618
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,916
... about getting one
of those patches?

619
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,355
Ah... yeah, I think it was like,
a one-time deal, man.

620
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,353
After 9/11, my uncle sent
a bunch out for the platoon...

621
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,478
... but uh... after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.

622
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,471
No, no, I'm not gonna
take your family crest.

623
01:02:18,640 --> 01:02:21,154
All right, good. I didn't
want to give it to you anyway.

624
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,151
Besides, man,
I'm pretty sure I saw you...

625
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,231
... putting something in your
cargo pocket the other day.

626
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:29,129
- What's that?
- I know I've seen you carrying...

627
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,918
... something in that
pocket right there.

628
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,555
What is it?

629
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:35,989
That's my grandfather's flag.

630
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:37,752
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me...

631
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,558
... and now I'm gonna
give it to my boy someday.

632
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:41,711
All right.
I like that.

633
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,198
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

634
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:54,509
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.

635
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,989
- I believe it's called Starship.
- "Starship."

636
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:58,479
I love the way you say Starship.

637
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,154
It's like Russian.
That guy, uh... Star Trek.

638
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,390
What's his name, Scotty?
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.

639
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,915
- I wouldn't know.
- Yes. You've never seen Star Trek?

640
01:03:06,080 --> 01:03:07,752
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.

641
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:09,353
- So here's the problem, pal.
- Mm-hm?

642
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,356
You're worth a lot of money.

643
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:14,911
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.

644
01:03:15,080 --> 01:03:16,195
- You do?
- Yes.

645
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:20,069
All right. Let me tell you how
the world works there, Crisco.

646
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,798
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?

647
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:23,598
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.

648
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,688
It's okay.

649
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:26,559
Let me tell you
how the world really works.

650
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:27,914
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.

651
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:31,231
Since I walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.

652
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,597
You're just not. There's nothing
I can do to stop that...

653
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:37,718
... nothing I can do to help you right
now, unless you let me help you.

654
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:41,429
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.

655
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,509
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?

656
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,069
You're Jewish, right?

657
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:52,230
Shabal is what?

658
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:56,938
You got a friend, like,
you grew up with?

659
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:57,638
Sorry?

660
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,517
Have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?

661
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,175
- Yes.
- Had like, played interests...

662
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,671
... played soccer or...
what would you play?

663
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:03,871
Baseball, probably, right?

664
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,553
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.

665
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,039
And then you went
on your separate ways...

666
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,998
... and then some years later,
you meet up.

667
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:13,596
And you totally
didn't recognize the person.

668
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:15,751
And that's what happened
with Shabal.

669
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:18,559
We share a common interest.

670
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:22,952
So he came up with this incredible
idea because of his beliefs.

671
01:04:23,120 --> 01:04:27,398
I don't necessarily share his
beliefs, but he's a smart guy.

672
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:29,551
You know, it's almost like...

673
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:31,318
... you know, it's almost like...

674
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:32,595
... like this is me.

675
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,079
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?

676
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,196
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?

677
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:44,429
Yeah.

678
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,188
Cool concept, no?

679
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,879
- Right here?
- Yes.

680
01:04:50,360 --> 01:04:52,396
You think this is
some kind of game?

681
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:56,836
- Do you? Do you find this amusing?
- No. No.

682
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:57,956
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize...

683
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,056
... what you're doing here?

684
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,189
Blackbeard Actual,
this is Blackbeard Main.

685
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:04,669
Post nation counterpart.
Secured target Bravo.

686
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,991
Report to Tri-Hull. You're
clear to move on target Alpha.

687
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,833
Roger, Main.
Clear to target.

688
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:17,391
The only people
I answer to is my family.

689
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:22,070
To my wife and to my child.
And nobody else.

690
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,357
- Running late somewhere?
- Shit filter's full.

691
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,709
- Really?
- Yeah.

692
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,316
So here's the problem, pal.

693
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,311
You do love your family,
don't you?

694
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,550
- Yes, I do.
- And what about your daughter?

695
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,153
What about my daughter?

696
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,151
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?

697
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:40,958
Every minute of my life.

698
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,197
I wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously...

699
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,914
... because you're gonna be
sitting in a box somewhere.

700
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:14,868
You'll be treated properly
and humanely.

701
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:20,838
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married...

702
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,231
... and your wife is gonna
find someone else...

703
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,312
... and you're gonna
miss everything.

704
01:06:34,520 --> 01:06:37,956
If I had done something
that would endanger my family...

705
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,236
... I would feel just
like you do right now.

706
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:45,031
You promise not
to touch my family?

707
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,077
I would never touch your family.

708
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,509
I would not.

709
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,039
Are you familiar with...

710
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,953
... ceramic ball bearings?

711
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,413
No.

712
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,875
Just imagine 16 suicide vests...

713
01:07:07,080 --> 01:07:09,116
... filled with those
ceramic ball bearings...

714
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,751
... slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.

715
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,794
You think your economy
is fucked now?

716
01:07:19,240 --> 01:07:23,119
Just think what the media
is gonna do with this. Hm?

717
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:26,636
It's gonna make 9/11 look like
a fucking walk in the park.

718
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,711
The grand Central Park.

719
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,052
So you're telling me...

720
01:07:32,920 --> 01:07:38,916
... there's 16 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.

721
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,477
They're gonna walk
right across the border.

722
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,158
So where are they going?

723
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,758
San Diego, San Francisco,
Houston...

724
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,632
You pick a city, they'll be there.

725
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:56,078
- And this is happening now?
- It's happening as we speak.

726
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,314
Sorry, what?

727
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,914
It's happening as we speak.

728
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,197
How can you stop this?

729
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:10,238
I can't.

730
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:03,597
Blackbeard Lead,
containment element is set.

731
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:04,949
Roger.

732
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,952
Gun! Gun!
Gun!

733
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,955
Clear!

734
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,175
- Go.
- Coming out!

735
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:59,114
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard. We're in
contact, midtown, south of the church.

736
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,157
Contact!

737
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:26,838
Contact!

738
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,150
Changing!

739
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:39,037
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?

740
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:41,156
Overwatch.
You're clear to engage.

741
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,355
Go in hot.

742
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,678
Frag out!

743
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,197
Weimy, I've got two squirters
heading south in a pickup truck.

744
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:24,949
I see 'em.

745
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,072
Hit those two guys in the truck.

746
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:53,395
Rocket!

747
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:02,708
Frag out!

748
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,791
Sir?
Sir?

749
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:07,679
LT?
Are you all right?

750
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,749
Damn.

751
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,717
You check that box, huh?

752
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:18,199
Yeah.

753
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,178
Good thing that was a dud.
I might've gotten hurt.

754
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:24,957
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

755
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:28,599
Jesus.

756
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:35,197
This is not some bush-league
vest from an Iraqi hut.

757
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,679
This is some high-speed shit.

758
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,549
Maybe we should put this
somewhere else, huh?

759
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,710
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere
to put this, would you?

760
01:15:57,520 --> 01:16:00,318
Target secure.
Set security.

761
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,869
One's to the north, three south.

762
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:49,393
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

763
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:51,551
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.

764
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,678
Actual, mission not complete.
Stand by for follow-on.

765
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,677
You only got half that jihadist cell.

766
01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,031
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.

767
01:17:00,200 --> 01:17:03,033
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border...

768
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:06,510
... using a tunnel network
from Mexicali at 0700.

769
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,234
We're coordinating with State, but
for now the birds will drop you off...

770
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:12,710
... outside the city where your
POC is a Commander Pedros.

771
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:14,632
I'll give you more details en route.

772
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,916
- Actual, how do you copy?
- Roger, Main.

773
01:17:17,080 --> 01:17:19,071
Okay, we've got a helo
landing on the deck...

774
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:21,390
... we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

775
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:24,393
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

776
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,856
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

777
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:31,037
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

778
01:17:31,200 --> 01:17:32,792
All right.
And the rest of the boys...

779
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,115
... how are they getting
back to the ship?

780
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,554
Bon Homme Richard
stayed on station.

781
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,631
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

782
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:40,075
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

783
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:43,152
Okay. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

784
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:45,038
Perfect.
Squad Two stays here, buttons it up...

785
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:46,952
- ... pulls out with the Marines.
- Okay.

786
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:56,912
We're moving north of here
through town and crossing at sunrise.

787
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,433
The other group will get into Texas
the following day through Juarez.

788
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,233
Comprendes?

789
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,079
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared
us hot to go to Mexicali anyway?

790
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,435
This one's going all
the way up the flagpole.

791
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,238
State Department's on it.

792
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,834
Hey, sir.
Channel two.

793
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,632
Hey, this tempo
keeps up like this...

794
01:19:12,800 --> 01:19:15,314
... Jackie's gonna be squeezing
that kid out on her own.

795
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:18,916
However, we hit this target
quick enough...

796
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,916
... you jump on a burro
and ride that shit home.

797
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:24,595
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

798
01:19:26,120 --> 01:19:27,473
Did you get your two weeks?

799
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:29,870
All that time I was
spending on the sat phone...

800
01:19:30,040 --> 01:19:32,349
... it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home...

801
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,590
... it was to convince them
to leave your ass in charge.

802
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,470
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.

803
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,896
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?

804
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,353
All the way to the top,
from what I heard.

805
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,497
There is something
that you have to understand.

806
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:54,348
My superiors, they're very
fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

807
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,590
No Black Hawk Down
is what they're saying...

808
01:20:56,591 --> 01:20:58,352
... so we do need
to stay under the radar.

809
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,476
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.

810
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:03,473
Your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.

811
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:05,153
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.

812
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:06,505
Help piece this together for me.

813
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:08,039
- Okay.
- Our intel says...

814
01:21:08,040 --> 01:21:10,639
... they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.

815
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,396
This mean anything to you?

816
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,349
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.

817
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,192
Then that's where we're going.

818
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,157
Of all of the places in Mexicali...

819
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,311
... that you could have picked,
this is probably the worst.

820
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:23,511
The cartels control
that area from all angles.

821
01:21:23,680 --> 01:21:25,318
They have us heavily outgunned.

822
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:27,715
Simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.

823
01:21:27,880 --> 01:21:30,474
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

824
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:32,949
Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.

825
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:35,315
If they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.

826
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:37,630
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go...

827
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,792
... but prepare your men for a bigger
fight than what you had imagined.

828
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:42,157
You're not fighting eight men.

829
01:21:42,220 --> 01:21:44,157
You're also fighting the cartel
that's protecting them.

830
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:46,550
If your targets make it
into those tunnels...

831
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:48,711
... they'll disappear like ghosts.

832
01:23:31,120 --> 01:23:32,872
You enter the tunnels right here.

833
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,156
You will walk
seven miles to this fork.

834
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,218
My men will tell you
what tunnel to take.

835
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:41,596
Once you get to this point,
my job is done.

836
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,557
You're on your own.

837
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,253
- Lieutenant, we're going now!
- Roger that.

838
01:24:36,680 --> 01:24:40,639
Chief, we're not stopping.
We're rolling up on target, hard.

839
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:43,434
Roger that, sir.
We're about 30 seconds out.

840
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,912
One mike out from
the south entrance.

841
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,552
Jefe!
On the roof!

842
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,296
We gotta go.
Now.

843
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:26,358
- Sir!
- Leave two men here!

844
01:26:55,080 --> 01:26:56,069
Weimy!

845
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:00,909
Weimy!

846
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,535
I need you to lock this shit down!

847
01:27:12,080 --> 01:27:13,308
Frag out!

848
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,028
On me.

849
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,796
You guys got the gate!

850
01:27:44,960 --> 01:27:47,630
Call! You're going
to the front door!

851
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:51,538
Go!

852
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:20,234
Call!

853
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:12,468
Changing!

854
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,155
Damn it, sir.

855
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,639
How are you gonna explain
that one to my family?

856
01:30:55,840 --> 01:30:58,149
Get back there
so I don't have to, huh?

857
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:15,708
Clear!

858
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,610
Grenade!

859
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,068
LT!

860
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:46,379
Chief, I got him.

861
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,512
Keep going.
I'll cover you.

862
01:34:58,080 --> 01:34:59,274
Chief.

863
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,113
Chief!

864
01:35:09,280 --> 01:35:11,430
Assault Two,
this is Assault One.

865
01:35:11,640 --> 01:35:15,792
Be advised, tunnel is secure
and all threats are neutralized.

866
01:35:15,960 --> 01:35:18,110
LT and Chief are down.

867
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:21,272
I say again,
LT and Chief are down.

868
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,717
Your father was a good man.

869
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:22,314
Growing up without him
is gonna be hard.

870
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,471
It's gonna hurt.

871
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:28,599
You'll feel alone, out to sea,
with no shore in sight.

872
01:36:28,800 --> 01:36:32,793
You'll wonder,
"Why me? Why him?"

873
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:48,831
Remember, you have
warrior's blood in your veins.

874
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,912
The code that made your father
who he was is the same code...

875
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:55,834
... that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.

876
01:36:57,320 --> 01:37:00,630
Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.

877
01:37:00,800 --> 01:37:03,837
Like those people in the
paintings your father liked...

878
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:08,556
... we are men made up of boxes,
chambers of loss and triumph...

879
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:12,076
... of hurt and hope and love.

880
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,839
No one is stronger
or more dangerous...

881
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:18,218
... than a man who can
harness his emotions.

882
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:20,235
His past.

883
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:22,779
Aim!

884
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:27,670
Aim!

885
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:33,272
Use it as fuel,
as ammunition...

886
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,910
... as ink to write the most
important letter of your life.

887
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,437
On behalf of the President
of the United States...

888
01:37:41,600 --> 01:37:45,718
... and a grateful nation,
I present you this flag...

889
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:49,496
... in recognition of your
husband's heroic achievements.

890
01:37:53,400 --> 01:37:55,914
You have my
deepest condolences.

891
01:38:00,560 --> 01:38:03,015
One more flag to present.

892
01:38:03,080 --> 01:38:05,469
This one I think you know.

893
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:11,412
On every deployment,
Rorke carried this with him.

894
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:17,634
Again, my deepest condolences.

895
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,119
Lieutenant Engel!

896
01:38:29,280 --> 01:38:31,919
Hoo-yah, Lieutenant Engel!

897
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:41,758
Before he died, your father asked me
to give you this poem by Tecumseh.

898
01:39:41,920 --> 01:39:44,878
I told him I'd fold it
into a paper airplane.

899
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,799
And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing...

900
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,117
... sailing it from him to you.

901
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,231
Live your life
that the fear of death...

902
01:39:56,400 --> 01:39:58,550
... can never enter your heart.

903
01:39:58,760 --> 01:40:01,069
Trouble no one
about his religion.

904
01:40:01,240 --> 01:40:03,276
Respect others and their views.

905
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:06,079
And demand they respect yours.

906
01:40:06,240 --> 01:40:09,312
Love your life, perfect your life.

907
01:40:09,520 --> 01:40:12,239
Beautify all things in your life.

908
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:16,911
Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people.

909
01:40:17,080 --> 01:40:18,991
When your time comes to die...

910
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:22,596
... be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death.

911
01:40:22,760 --> 01:40:24,910
So that when their time comes
they weep and pray...

912
01:40:25,120 --> 01:40:28,908
... for a little more time to live their
lives over again in a different way.

913
01:40:29,120 --> 01:40:31,031
Sing your death song...

914
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,292
... and die like a hero going home.
