1
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:38,271
John venice beach...
A city built on contrast.

2
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:40,540
Decade old concrete buildings
layered...

3
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,342
Between million dollar homes.

4
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:45,078
Worn out beach bums litter
the same streets...

5
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:47,447
Your cousins from Oklahoma
visit every summer.

6
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:50,417
Every weird dive bar you love
is being pushed out...

7
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:52,719
By some shitbag tech company.

8
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,056
And somewhere between the
ruckus, you'll find this guy...

9
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,258
Venice's only licensed
detective.

10
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,692
You just gotta live your life.

11
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:02,762
It goes by so fast.
It's like a whisper.

12
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:04,531
John
that's my boss, Steve Ford...

13
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,766
A self-appointed figurehead
in the community.

14
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,536
Takes that job very seriously.

15
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,671
Before you know it,
you're 12 years old...

16
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,506
And then where are you?

17
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:16,109
I don't want you to make the
same mistakes that I made.

18
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,178
It starts like this, a little
bit of weed...

19
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:20,680
And then a little bit
of blow, okay?

20
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:23,316
And then a couple bottles
of Tequila every week.

21
00:01:23,317 --> 00:01:25,585
And hookers three times a week.

22
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,822
And yeah, it's fun, in the moment, it's
fun... But let me tell you something.

23
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,325
Those moments always end up when
your head feels like this big...

24
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,127
Like a bus ran over it.

25
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:37,730
You happy about that? No, you're
not happy about that.

26
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,632
Then not too long after that...

27
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:43,103
You're sitting on your kitchen
floor, buck naked...

28
00:01:43,104 --> 00:01:44,704
You got a gun in your mouth...

29
00:01:44,705 --> 00:01:48,308
And all you're thinking about
is, is today the day?

30
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:52,477
Is today the day I pull the
trigger? Bang!

31
00:01:54,681 --> 00:01:56,382
But you got a right to live...

32
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:02,754
And you gotta fuckin' live
right, you get me?

33
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:07,727
All right... let's go.

34
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:12,898
This is a skate park, come on.
Let's go skate.

35
00:02:30,584 --> 00:02:32,585
John I always wanted
to be a private detective...

36
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,754
And with Steve being the only
outfit in town...

37
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,689
I really had no other choice
but to work with him.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:39,259
Which is good... I think.

39
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,395
And seeing as he was busy
mentoring the local youth...

40
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:46,266
Of today, I was left to finally
get a shot at cracking...

41
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:52,539
My first case and it has led me
here, to Nola tuiasosopo...

42
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,307
At least, I believe I'm
pronouncing that right...

43
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,642
I don't know, she's samoan.

44
00:02:55,643 --> 00:02:57,343
Not that there's anything wrong
with that...

45
00:02:57,344 --> 00:03:01,214
Some of them have tricky
last names, some of them.

46
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:02,815
God, well, I'll edit that later.

47
00:03:02,816 --> 00:03:04,951
Missing since July...

48
00:03:04,952 --> 00:03:08,688
I just spotted her at the corner
of sixth and oakwood.

49
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:11,891
And, let me tell you,
Steve was not exaggerating...

50
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,960
Nola is very attractive.

51
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,763
Scratch that, she is very, very
insanely...

52
00:03:16,764 --> 00:03:20,266
Why isn't she a professional
model-attractive.

53
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:22,335
Anyway, by the looks of it...

54
00:03:22,336 --> 00:03:25,772
She's going into a support group
of some kind.

55
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:29,174
I'm guessing alcoholics
anonymous, just...

56
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:33,246
Shit. Dammit.

57
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,881
Agh!

58
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,650
John and my name's John,
Steve's partner.

59
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:39,552
Well, soon to be partner...

60
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,087
Just waiting for some paperwork.

61
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,493
Who'd like to go first?

62
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:59,672
Hello, my name's Rick
and I'm a sex addict.

63
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:01,941
Hi, Rick.

64
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:05,979
My poison's pornography. It
started back in catholic school...

65
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,681
And got progressively worse.

66
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:11,985
I'm currently logging
about 40 hours a week.

67
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:14,254
That's a full-time job.

68
00:04:14,255 --> 00:04:16,589
I've got premium subscriptions
to the big four...

69
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,592
Pornhub, redtube, reality kings
and brazzers.

70
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:26,498
Not to mention, eskimotube,
jizzhut...

71
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,735
God, I'm a monster!

72
00:04:34,807 --> 00:04:38,011
Jesus, right?

73
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:40,045
Would you like to share
with the group?

74
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,616
Would you like to
share with the group?

75
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,985
The group? No! No, I'm good.

76
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:47,920
I'm good to just listen.

77
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:50,290
That's not really how it works.

78
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,991
Everyone is required
to participate...

79
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,726
On their first night, please.

80
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,033
Well, if it's required.

81
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:04,537
Okay.

82
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:11,744
Um, I'm John and I'm
a sex addict.

83
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,178
Hi, John.

84
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:14,981
Hello.

85
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,750
Yeah, I just love sex.

86
00:05:17,751 --> 00:05:19,519
I love getting it,
i love giving it.

87
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,789
I love it too much
and I get it too much...

88
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,424
That's my main problem.

89
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:26,826
On that sex road, I've got
my thumb out...

90
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:29,095
Waiting to get on one
of the sex cars.

91
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:32,832
I am also logging
about 40 hours a week...

92
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:37,070
But on sex, not just jacki"
off like this guy, right?

93
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:39,005
Full-blown sex.

94
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:42,542
And, actually, come to think
of it, it's more than 40 hours.

95
00:05:42,543 --> 00:05:44,544
So, I'm doing time and a half.

96
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:46,846
I should get paid my overtime.

97
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,982
I mean, obviously I'm not
condoning sex for money.

98
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,451
That's bad, right?

99
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,986
We all agree, would you? Good.

100
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:58,991
I really just have sex with any
old thang that comes my way.

101
00:05:58,992 --> 00:06:02,862
There's some limits, obviously,
age, 18 and below is no...

102
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:04,731
No bueno, no good.

103
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:07,867
Upwards, though, is where
i really shine...

104
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,771
50, 60, 80, 90, centennials...

105
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,473
Okay!

106
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:16,274
Thank you for sharing, John.
All right, you got it.

107
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:33,092
Nola? Hey, Nola?

108
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:35,061
Are you following me?

109
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:38,030
No, no, no, I'm not following
you, no, no, don't mace me!

110
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,433
I'm not a stalker.

111
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:44,170
I am technically following you,
but not in a stalker way...

112
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:47,840
Just as a professional...
Strictly professional.

113
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:52,979
Look, your brothers hired my
boss to find you...

114
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,816
And that's where I come in.

115
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:59,985
They want you to come home,
okay, they miss you.

116
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:05,425
I could drive you, at least
to my boss' house.

117
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:07,193
In a professional way...

118
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:12,097
Not as a maniac or a pervert,
on either parts.

119
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:19,739
Yeah, I'll let her know.

120
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,176
All right, so you'll be safe
there till tomorrow...

121
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:25,912
And then in the morning
we can figure out...

122
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,880
How best to deal
with your brothers.

123
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,787
Well, how about that Rick guy?
40 hours a week?

124
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,858
I mean, that's a serious
commitment to masturbation.

125
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:41,494
Yeah, hopefully he's changing
hands every once in a while.

126
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:44,630
I mean, if you don't, that's
carpal tunnel syndrome...

127
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,165
And the blistering... Agh!

128
00:07:46,166 --> 00:07:48,167
And chafing. Yeah.

129
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:51,804
Let's just hope he's got a
little tub of like, neosporin.

130
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,841
Ew! Well, I'm just saying.

131
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,375
Sorry.

132
00:08:03,783 --> 00:08:06,819
Okay, well, this is it. Great.

133
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,223
Yeah. As you can see, it's
a very nice establishment.

134
00:08:10,224 --> 00:08:11,923
And you'll be home in no time.

135
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,560
Steve send her up.

136
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,596
There he is.

137
00:08:16,597 --> 00:08:18,130
Steve's a great guy.

138
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:20,833
All right, well, pleasure
to meet you.

139
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,268
You, too. Yeah.

140
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,836
Thanks for the ride.
No problem, just doing my job.

141
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:28,006
Goodbye. See ya.

142
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,915
She'll be fine.

143
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:41,119
Steve's a good guy.

144
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:43,755
She'll be fine.

145
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:51,257
Stay down! You're gonna wish
you never touched her!

146
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,925
Stop it, you're gonna kill him!

147
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,261
Nola, take your ass in the
goddamn room...

148
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,829
And don't you come out of there!

149
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,831
Listen, listen,
let's talk about this.

150
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,332
You're about to go through
a samoan storm.

151
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,436
Paid you to find her, Steve.
I did find her!

152
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,941
We told you to find her,
not fuck her.

153
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,143
She's our sister, you son
of a bitch.

154
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:13,178
Yeah.

155
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,424
You're dead, Steve!

156
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:32,363
Run, Steve, run!

157
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:53,119
Okay, hands, pal!
Let me see your hands!

158
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,954
I said hands, now, get them up!

159
00:10:56,856 --> 00:10:58,824
Aw, Jesus.

160
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:00,993
Bill, it's you.
Jesus, how you doing, man?

161
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,995
Steve, what the hell are you
doing out here?

162
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,431
Look, aren't you tired of this
Peter Pan bullshit?

163
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:08,367
This is no kind of life,
you're an old man.

164
00:11:08,368 --> 00:11:10,269
Now why don't you just meet
somebody your own age...

165
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,071
And make a life, for god sakes?

166
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,873
I will.

167
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:17,076
You know, someday, Steve, one of
these guys is gonna catch you...

168
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,911
And what are you gonna do then?

169
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:23,416
Call 9-1-1, come find you,
we're gonna eat a lot of donuts.

170
00:11:23,417 --> 00:11:25,718
Fuck you, Steve.
Take care of yourself.

171
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:26,986
Go home. Be careful.

172
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,988
This is not normal, okay?

173
00:11:28,989 --> 00:11:31,389
They hook electrodes up to
people when they do this.

174
00:11:35,928 --> 00:11:39,364
Well, that's what that feels
like.

175
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,782
There he is, get him!

176
00:11:56,783 --> 00:12:00,186
Turn, turn, hurry up! Hurry up!

177
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,020
Go, go, go!

178
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:04,757
Yeah, we got him now.

179
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:07,226
Faster.

180
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,261
Go, go, go, go, go!
Look at this asshole!

181
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,440
Shit!
Come on, let's go, let's go.

182
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,413
Excuse me.

183
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,014
Steve, you can't have a gun
in the bar!

184
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:33,484
You motherfucker!

185
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,425
Let's go, go, go!

186
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,265
Go, go, go, go!

187
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:59,545
Tino, tino. Let me in!

188
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:01,546
Where'd he go?

189
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:04,383
Yo, open up, man. Come on.

190
00:13:04,384 --> 00:13:05,851
You're naked.

191
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:07,887
What? Yeah, naked.
Please let me in.

192
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,488
I can't take another heart
break, Steve.

193
00:13:09,489 --> 00:13:11,924
The car? That's what this
is about?

194
00:13:11,925 --> 00:13:13,125
I loved that car, Steve.

195
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,827
Man, come on, tino.

196
00:13:14,828 --> 00:13:16,061
It was stolen and I asked
for your help.

197
00:13:16,062 --> 00:13:17,363
I'm sorry, all right?

198
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,964
I got feelings and I'm
sensitive.

199
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:22,034
I know you're sensitive.
I understand!

200
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:24,170
Alright, I'll get the car, I'll
get the car for you, alright?

201
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,971
Say you promise. I promise.

202
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,373
You're not saying it.
I promise you I'll get it.

203
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:28,941
No! Fingers up. I promise.

204
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,376
Let me in, man, all right!

205
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,944
Cover that dick, all right,
i got pizza here.

206
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,511
All right, yeah.

207
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,252
Fuck.

208
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,060
Orale. Pull, fucker!

209
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,266
I'm not going in there.
That's spyder's place.

210
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:57,570
My car's in that guy's garage,
Steve, you gotta get it for me.

211
00:13:57,571 --> 00:14:00,573
I'm not a repo man, okay,
I'm a fucking detective.

212
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,142
You promised, Steve. I saved
your ass, Steve.

213
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,444
Your word is your bond.
Okay, all right.

214
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:08,380
Your word is your bond!

215
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:12,284
All right, all right, just
relax. Give me the keys.

216
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,919
Thank you, Steve.

217
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,253
I got this.

218
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,526
Hell yeah, fool.

219
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:33,873
Hey. Two large pepperoni pizzas.
You ordered them, right?

220
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:37,142
Hey, spyder, pizza dude's here.

221
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:40,312
John Carlos Manuel
ochoa, goes by the name of...

222
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:43,249
Spyder, with a "y," with links
to the Sinaloa cartel.

223
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,885
Rumor has it he once killed
a barista at Starbucks...

224
00:14:45,886 --> 00:14:47,553
For misspelling his name.

225
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,122
Which is tricky, it's with a
"y." Not the point.

226
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,024
If there's drugs being sold
in venice...

227
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,257
They're coming from spyder.

228
00:14:55,461 --> 00:14:58,097
Two pepperoni pizzas. Didn't you
order that?

229
00:14:58,098 --> 00:15:00,098
No one ordered pizza, man.

230
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:03,936
2-0-0-4, this is your pizza,
right?

231
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,205
Kinda old to be delivering
pizzas, aye?

232
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:07,673
You're telling me, man...

233
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,174
My old lady gives me shit
all the time about it.

234
00:15:09,175 --> 00:15:10,541
How much?

235
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:14,512
$25.00.

236
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,983
Thanks, man, thank you,
that's plenty.

237
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:20,185
Hey, man, can I use your
restroom?

238
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,655
I've been in the car
a long time.

239
00:15:22,656 --> 00:15:24,123
One or two?

240
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,456
One.

241
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,393
All right, bro.

242
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,028
Where is it?

243
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,697
To the left. Don't piss on the
seat?

244
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:34,533
All right.

245
00:15:34,534 --> 00:15:36,669
Who the fuck are you, are you a
cop!?

246
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,337
No. Who are you?

247
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,638
St... Steve.

248
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:41,206
Is that right?

249
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,241
I'm spyder's friend.

250
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,342
Yeah?

251
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:45,843
That's the lavatory, right?

252
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,204
Whoa.

253
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:10,628
Hey, spyder, I think someone's
stealing your car.

254
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,776
Motherfucker.

255
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,094
You killed my car.

256
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,198
Aw, you can't kill a car like
this, man, look at it.

257
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:21,633
You know, a little hammer,
a little glass.

258
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:23,000
Tires still look fantastic.

259
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,476
Sorry.

260
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,482
Fuck!

261
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,434
John Dave Jones...

262
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:58,203
And no, not the lead singer
of the monkees.

263
00:18:58,204 --> 00:19:01,173
This guy's a local legend and
Steve's longtime best pal.

264
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:04,576
His claim to fame was surfing
the pier naked...

265
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:06,879
For 12 hours straight...
On acid.

266
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,381
Nowadays he's lost a lot
of that mojo...

267
00:19:09,382 --> 00:19:11,850
Mainly due to a pretty nasty
divorce.

268
00:19:11,851 --> 00:19:12,851
Hey, Dave.

269
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,924
Did you start working
at tino's pizza?

270
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:26,465
Yeah. You want my take on all
of this?

271
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,766
Yeah.

272
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,568
Never buy a surf shop,
look at this inventory.

273
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,307
She wants full assets
and alimony, too.

274
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:39,211
Sorry, man. You're gonna
be all right.

275
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:41,580
We'll figure something out.

276
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:43,382
Sun's gonna be up soon.

277
00:19:43,383 --> 00:19:47,252
Yeah, it is. Should probably
get some sleep.

278
00:19:47,253 --> 00:19:50,020
I just finished your new board.

279
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:08,407
This has been fun, but I gotta
go pick up my dog.

280
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,609
Why don't you just let
her have buddy?

281
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,247
She likes that I come by
to pick him up.

282
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:18,549
Makes her feel better,
safer I think.

283
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,752
Her?

284
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,805
John Steve's sister has
fallen on hard times...

285
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:42,307
After her husband took off and
emptied their bank account.

286
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:43,808
He's really been there for her.

287
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:45,711
Steve.

288
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:46,945
John
helping out as much as he can.

289
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:49,281
Hey, katey.
Thanks for the coffee.

290
00:20:49,282 --> 00:20:51,115
John it's pretty selfless
of him, actually.

291
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:56,321
John see? What a guy.

292
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:03,127
Taylor! Taylor! Uncle Steve's
here to pick up buddy.

293
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,434
Have you heard from him?

294
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,471
Still somewhere in Australia
and finding himself.

295
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,273
We can't afford to stay here.

296
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,875
He thinks there's something
more out there.

297
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:18,677
I mean, what the fuck
is out there?

298
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:22,713
Honey, I don't know.
You're gonna be all right.

299
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:30,822
John buddy Ford, 49 years old...

300
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:33,725
In dog years and 100 percent
parson Russell terrier.

301
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:35,759
Man, does Steve love that dog.

302
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,729
Uncle Steve.

303
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,465
Hi, Taylor. What are you
studying?

304
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,967
Chemistry.

305
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,601
Want some help with that?

306
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:45,669
A.P. Chemistry.

307
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,778
Will you bring buddy back
later tonight?

308
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:55,347
How about if I bring him back
every night and pick him up...

309
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,983
First thing in the morning,
until you tell me to stop?

310
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,551
Really?

311
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:00,784
Yeah.

312
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,422
That would be cool.

313
00:22:03,423 --> 00:22:07,459
He gets a little gassy.
I don't mind it.

314
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:14,031
Come on, buddy, here we go. Come
on, here you go, right out here.

315
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:45,664
Sorry, no dogs.

316
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:46,932
No, he's all right.

317
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,867
What does that mean?

318
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:51,436
That's just something I say when
i try to circumvent the rules.

319
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:53,972
Sometimes it works.

320
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:56,775
No? All right. Get out, pal.

321
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:58,842
Large coffee.

322
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,651
You're not in your office.

323
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,553
Lew the Jew.

324
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:11,857
John whoa, whoa, okay,
I know how that sounds.

325
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:15,127
It's not offensive, everyone
calls him that.

326
00:23:15,128 --> 00:23:16,995
I mean, he calls himself,
"lew the Jew."

327
00:23:16,996 --> 00:23:19,097
No, I'm not in my office.

328
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,433
I went by your office.
And you didn't find me there?

329
00:23:21,434 --> 00:23:23,068
Steve, I want to hire you.

330
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,536
John he's a savvy businessman...

331
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:26,004
And a little miserly...

332
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,407
But not in a Jewish way,
in a normal way.

333
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,442
Girl in the picture...
Hey, hey, Steve...

334
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,477
That's a lot of money for just
a few pictures, you know?

335
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:35,480
Yeah. Could've cost you a lot
more money.

336
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:37,716
Why are we arguing?
Let's talk business.

337
00:23:37,717 --> 00:23:39,117
Thank you.

338
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,853
I'll see you later, lew.

339
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,423
Let's go, buddy.

340
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,692
Some son of a bitch graffiti
punk has been spray-painting...

341
00:23:47,693 --> 00:23:50,695
The walls of my apartment
buildings.

342
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:52,898
Well, I could certainly help
you with that.

343
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:54,433
I know many of the taggers
in the neighborhood...

344
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:56,168
The only problem is,
you still owe me money.

345
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:57,869
Aw, Steve, I can't pay you
for that.

346
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,105
You understand, it's the
principle of the thing.

347
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:03,108
Steve! We're getting the band
back together, bro!

348
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,877
Great! My man!

349
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:09,481
Yeah! Taylor swift saved the
music industry!

350
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,149
Who the hell is that?

351
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,918
No clue.

352
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:14,685
I'll sell you the house back.

353
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,756
My parent's house?

354
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,157
Yeah.

355
00:24:19,158 --> 00:24:21,026
You'll sell it back to me?

356
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:23,762
At the same price they sold
it to you for?

357
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:27,065
Come on, Stevie, you're killing
me, man.

358
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,900
I mean, this is silicon beach
now.

359
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,469
You realize what I could get
for that house?

360
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,202
No deal.

361
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,673
Ten percent more.

362
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,114
I can see this is really
important to you, lew.

363
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:45,717
What gave it away?

364
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:47,953
I want it in writing.

365
00:24:47,954 --> 00:24:52,222
You're killin' me. Fine, let's
go. I gotta show it to you.

366
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:57,094
Holy Christ.

367
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,498
See what I mean?

368
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:00,966
I like it.

369
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:03,134
You could see how I might not.

370
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:05,203
He's really captured
your essence.

371
00:25:05,204 --> 00:25:07,873
Why don't you just
paint over it?

372
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,241
I painted over it four times.

373
00:25:09,242 --> 00:25:10,642
All right, you should have seen
the other shit...

374
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:11,977
It was filthier than this.

375
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,145
I can't imagine anything
filthier than this.

376
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:18,083
Just get it done, Steve, if you
want your parent's house back.

377
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,983
Just pay me.

378
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,456
Don't look at that, come
here, don't look at that.

379
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:35,267
How about this?

380
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:38,335
Cash only, no checks.
And that's on sale.

381
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:41,740
Great, thanks.

382
00:25:41,741 --> 00:25:46,176
She can take my shop, but I'm
not leaving her anything.

383
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,213
Yeah.

384
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:51,917
I'm letting it go.

385
00:25:51,918 --> 00:25:55,486
You do that, pal, let it all go.

386
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:09,801
John
now, normally by this time...

387
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:11,937
Steve's already had about eight
cups of coffee...

388
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:15,006
And he doesn't really handle
the caffeine all that well.

389
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:17,876
So, a little secret between you
and I is I switched the brew...

390
00:26:17,877 --> 00:26:21,246
In our office with decaf, you
know, to take the edge off.

391
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,315
John. Have you seen
a picture around here...

392
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:24,683
A picture of my house?

393
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,918
Wow, this is good coffee.

394
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:30,155
The samoans called
looking for you.

395
00:26:30,156 --> 00:26:33,358
I said that you were very sorry.

396
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,094
Good. You didn't give them the
address to the office, right?

397
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:37,729
No. Good.

398
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,865
Although, I'm sure if they were
to do any type...

399
00:26:40,866 --> 00:26:44,134
Of light investigating, they
could find out where it is.

400
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:49,874
Um... what about the picture?

401
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,844
It's a picture of my family's
house.

402
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:55,313
No. Look, the insurance company
said they won't pay...

403
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:59,050
Until you get a couple things
sorted out.

404
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:01,620
A picture of my parent's house.

405
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:03,054
Yeah, I haven't seen it.

406
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,156
It was on my desk.
Okay, still, no house.

407
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:07,192
The insurance company said that
we won't get paid...

408
00:27:07,193 --> 00:27:08,693
Until we, you know, file them.

409
00:27:08,694 --> 00:27:11,896
We're on a new case now.

410
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,264
Great.

411
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,333
Lew the Jew, all his apartment
buildings...

412
00:27:15,334 --> 00:27:17,402
You're getting graffiti
all over the place.

413
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,237
There's a month of my life
down the drain.

414
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,339
The house, it was on my
desk... it was right...

415
00:27:24,743 --> 00:27:26,878
Sorry, this is it right here.

416
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:30,782
Well, let's see what
this photo is all about.

417
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:33,918
This is me as a kid. Look, seven
years old right there.

418
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,020
I'm holding the dog.

419
00:27:35,021 --> 00:27:37,122
That's you? Yeah.

420
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,957
You're such a fat kid.

421
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:41,726
You know, my parent's fed me all
the wrong food, but...

422
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:43,395
Yeah, a lot of it, too.

423
00:27:43,396 --> 00:27:46,865
Looks like you might have had
a third brother that you ate.

424
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,900
Surprised you didn't eat
the dog.

425
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:51,202
Just because of how big you are.

426
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,705
But you're good now, so...

427
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:56,207
Do you know any graffiti
artists around here?!

428
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:57,742
No, not personally...

429
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,344
Well, then you should find some,
how about that!

430
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:02,446
Yeah, sure, definitely,
I'll find some graffiti artists.

431
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,285
You should get some more
of this coffee, too.

432
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:10,388
Yep, definitely.

433
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:13,992
Steve, I need you.

434
00:28:13,993 --> 00:28:17,095
I lost a lot of this weight
right away.

435
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:18,362
Come on, buddy.

436
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:25,136
You also lost a lot of that
hair right away, too.

437
00:28:25,137 --> 00:28:26,871
Steve. Hey.

438
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,006
I need your help.

439
00:28:28,007 --> 00:28:29,841
All right, when? Right now.

440
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:31,743
Right now? Right now.

441
00:28:31,744 --> 00:28:36,147
You know why. I'm desperate.

442
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:40,151
Okay. All right, buddy,
in the back, up we go.

443
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,486
Right now?

444
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,120
Yep.

445
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,055
Stay low, buddy.

446
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,295
Put this in your ear, you'll be
able to hear me...

447
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:52,062
Talking to you the whole time.

448
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,933
Okay.

449
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,935
You sure you want to go
through with this?

450
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,737
I have to, Steve.

451
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,105
The first sign of trouble,
you get the fuck out of there.

452
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:01,272
I know, I will.

453
00:29:01,273 --> 00:29:02,572
I'm not kidding.

454
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,088
Wish me luck.

455
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:31,035
- Dave may I?
- Anne hi, Dave.

456
00:29:31,036 --> 00:29:32,970
Dave Anne.

457
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,115
You need to sign the divorce
papers, Dave.

458
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:46,117
Steve don't sign anything.

459
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:50,487
Repeat, do not sign anything,
Dave.

460
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:15,445
Dave!

461
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:19,584
I'll give you the surf shop,
you can have it.

462
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:21,586
Steve don't do it.

463
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,321
Get up and walk away.

464
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,788
You won't reconsider?

465
00:30:27,091 --> 00:30:29,626
It's done.

466
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:48,613
Dave, it's done!

467
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,182
Steve careful, buddy.

468
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,984
I'm going to sign these
papers...

469
00:30:52,985 --> 00:30:55,019
Because I've learned
how to let go.

470
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,387
Steve no.

471
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:59,424
And if you think you deserve
everything...

472
00:30:59,425 --> 00:31:04,162
I've ever worked for, then i
want you to have it...

473
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,930
Including the surf shop.

474
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,332
Steve no, no, Dave...

475
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,400
Don't sign anything, stop, stop.

476
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,786
I told him.

477
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,299
I think I fucked up.

478
00:31:43,501 --> 00:31:46,103
It'll be okay.

479
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,781
Come on, buddy.

480
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:06,357
You're gonna be spending some
time with Taylor.

481
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,493
Not forever. Come on.

482
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:18,568
That a boy. Go knock
on the door.

483
00:33:24,102 --> 00:33:26,037
How ya doin'?

484
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:29,206
I'm okay. How are you?

485
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,677
You know that I think
of you as a son.

486
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:38,716
I did not know that, but
thank you.

487
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:43,121
I guess I feel like, sometimes
i think of you as a father...

488
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:47,325
In a way... a very
intimidating father.

489
00:33:47,326 --> 00:33:48,593
I'm gonna need your help, John.

490
00:33:48,594 --> 00:33:52,430
Okay, what, like out
in the field?

491
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:54,732
You're gonna go out there and
you're gonna find out...

492
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57,068
Whoever's painting these murals
on lew the Jew's walls.

493
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:00,505
I checked out all the taggers
in the city. I got nothing.

494
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,540
The guy doesn't leave
a signature.

495
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:06,477
Maybe he's not a tagger, maybe
this guy's a trained artist.

496
00:34:06,478 --> 00:34:08,813
Okay, yeah, sure, yeah,
that fits.

497
00:34:08,814 --> 00:34:12,282
And John... wear extra
underpants.

498
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:15,252
Why?

499
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,622
Why?

500
00:34:17,623 --> 00:34:20,725
Why do I have to wear
extra underpants?

501
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:23,528
That's the discipline.

502
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:26,564
I'm sorry, sorry, it's part
of being a detective...

503
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,500
To wear multiple pairs
of underwear?

504
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:33,470
Do you have multiple pairs
of underwear on right now?

505
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:36,273
That's my secret.

506
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:38,843
Cool.

507
00:34:38,844 --> 00:34:40,645
Get yourself ready.

508
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:43,980
Classic father figure.

509
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:08,873
Jesus Christ, Nola, no, this has
gotta stop, okay?

510
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:11,809
It really does. It's over.

511
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,844
I cannot see you anymore.

512
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:18,348
I just had to see you.

513
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,688
Baby...

514
00:35:28,861 --> 00:35:30,428
Steve, don't answer that.

515
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:32,130
This is Taylor. Who's Taylor?

516
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,764
Hold on. Hey, honey, hi,
how are you doing?

517
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,399
Taylor uncle Steve.

518
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,602
I want you right now.
Who's that?

519
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:39,837
That's the maid,
she slipped and fell.

520
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:41,439
Taylor we've been
robbed, they took everything!

521
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,809
You got what!

522
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,412
They took everything, the TV,
the stereo, Taylor's Xbox.

523
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,680
I can't believe it, they took
buddy!

524
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,653
Try to stay calm
and wait for the cops.

525
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,822
Well, where are you going?
I'm gonna go and get my dog.

526
00:35:57,823 --> 00:36:00,358
Our dog. Our dog!

527
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,359
Don't leave!

528
00:36:16,374 --> 00:36:18,409
Rajeesh. I didn't see anything.

529
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,944
See what? Anything.

530
00:36:19,945 --> 00:36:22,480
What the fuck you talking... No.

531
00:36:22,481 --> 00:36:24,248
Well, can i...
Doesn't matter what it is.

532
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:25,483
I'm not trying to get into any
more trouble, Steve.

533
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:28,586
Well, can i... No!

534
00:36:28,587 --> 00:36:30,688
Your security camera is pointing
right down my street.

535
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,490
They hate me in this
neighborhood, all right?

536
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:34,525
Who hates you? You are beloved.

537
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:37,427
Not all of them, okay,
but I'm the outsider.

538
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:41,465
They stole my dog, buddy.

539
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,367
A delicacy in my country, right?

540
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:44,769
I never said that.

541
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,971
You thought it. $200.

542
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,606
$200?

543
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:51,074
That's how much it costs
to betray my neighbor.

544
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:54,110
What is it coming to?

545
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:06,924
How about $80?

546
00:37:06,925 --> 00:37:08,725
Fine. Loser.

547
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:22,306
Two guys, druggies, they tried
to trade their stuff...

548
00:37:22,307 --> 00:37:23,975
For some beer,
they had your dog.

549
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:26,009
I've seen them hanging out
down by the boardwalk.

550
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,982
You're a good neighbor.

551
00:37:30,983 --> 00:37:32,215
Fuck you, Steve.

552
00:37:43,361 --> 00:37:46,596
Hey, dickhead, can I hit that?

553
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,634
What'd you call us?

554
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:52,470
Actually, what I meant to say
was, dickheads.

555
00:37:52,471 --> 00:37:53,804
Dickhead one, dickhead two.

556
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:56,340
Hey, fuck you, man!

557
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:57,975
How's that?
Hey, what's your problem, bro!

558
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,811
You're my problem.
You broke my nose, fag!

559
00:38:00,812 --> 00:38:03,681
Shut up, who cares?
Where's my fucking dog?

560
00:38:03,682 --> 00:38:06,417
He ran away.
Yeah, he ran away. He ran away.

561
00:38:06,418 --> 00:38:07,918
What do you mean, he ran away?

562
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:10,388
We gave him to our dealer,
our dealer has him.

563
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:12,423
What's his name?
I don't know the dog's name!

564
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:13,858
Not the dog's name, idiot!
What's your dealer's name?

565
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:16,993
Spyder, his name is spyder!

566
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:23,266
Buddy's collar?

567
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,173
Never fuck with a man's dog.

568
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:43,753
Fuck me sideways.

569
00:38:50,594 --> 00:38:51,861
Hey, guys.

570
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,538
Spyder? Hey, spyder, it's me,
Steve, you remember?

571
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,944
I felt really bad about
crashing the car...

572
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,512
Through your garage door.

573
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:11,080
Brought you this delicious
basket of muf...

574
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:23,060
You got some grandé fucking
cojones showing your face...

575
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,827
Around here again, bro.

576
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:28,566
What time is it?

577
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,166
Time to fuck you up again, yo.

578
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,009
That fucker knocked himself out.

579
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,789
Hey, what is this?

580
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,657
Banana walnut.

581
00:39:53,658 --> 00:39:58,162
It's got a hint of cinnamon, yo.

582
00:39:58,163 --> 00:40:01,399
So, why you here, loco?

583
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,071
There's this girl. It's my
niece, Taylor, just turned 15.

584
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,106
She's a sweet girl.

585
00:40:09,107 --> 00:40:11,509
Does good in school, she's
smart, she's happy, she's funny.

586
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,445
Out of nowhere, her dad picks
up and takes off.

587
00:40:14,446 --> 00:40:17,014
Just goes to try and find
himself, whatever that means.

588
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:20,418
So now, I just... I look after
Taylor and her mom, katey.

589
00:40:20,419 --> 00:40:22,987
What the fuck this gotta do
with anything?

590
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:24,422
Let him finish.

591
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:25,956
Go, bro.

592
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:30,528
Last night, their house
got robbed.

593
00:40:30,529 --> 00:40:34,498
They took that TV, that
stereo system and that Xbox.

594
00:40:34,499 --> 00:40:37,634
But the most important thing
that they took was my dog.

595
00:40:38,569 --> 00:40:40,037
Buddy.

596
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,139
This dog? That is my dog.

597
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,874
I didn't steal this dog, okay?

598
00:40:43,875 --> 00:40:45,176
Yeah, that dog is my dog.
I didn't steal this dog.

599
00:40:45,177 --> 00:40:46,977
Shut up.

600
00:40:46,978 --> 00:40:51,749
Yo, we didn't steal no dog.
The dog was a gift.

601
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:55,586
Nevertheless, this dog
is the only thing...

602
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:58,688
That my niece gets
any comfort from.

603
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,029
So, you want the dog back?

604
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:07,631
I'm not giving you the dog back!
Shut up.

605
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,999
It's the only thing I want.

606
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,902
Okay then, ese.
You can have the dog back.

607
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:14,103
No! Yes. Shh.

608
00:41:16,874 --> 00:41:19,076
It's only gonna cost you $3,000.

609
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:21,212
$3,000?

610
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:23,481
$4,000. You just said, $3,000.

611
00:41:23,482 --> 00:41:24,782
You just fucked up my window.

612
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:26,016
You gave that dog to me.

613
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:27,283
Cállate.

614
00:41:29,753 --> 00:41:33,924
You give me four grand
for the car, the window...

615
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,594
And the garage and I'll throw
the dog in...

616
00:41:36,595 --> 00:41:40,498
Because the story of the little
niña... touched my heart, bro.

617
00:41:40,499 --> 00:41:42,500
I don't have that kind of money.

618
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,802
Then I'll fucking kill you.

619
00:41:44,803 --> 00:41:46,036
Then I can get it.

620
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:49,740
You got 24 hours, Holmes.

621
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:52,141
That's my dog, spyder.

622
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:11,195
John Yuri, venice's
local loan shark...

623
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:13,230
And ruthless son of a bitch.

624
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,566
Everybody knows, he is the
last person...

625
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,167
You want to borrow money from.

626
00:42:17,168 --> 00:42:19,570
He's also the last person
you want to see...

627
00:42:19,571 --> 00:42:20,838
On a beach wearing a bikini.

628
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:22,706
I love this country.

629
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,909
John he only gives you
a day to pay him back.

630
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,011
I mean, what kind of person
borrows money from a guy...

631
00:42:27,012 --> 00:42:29,580
Who only gives you a day
to pay him back?

632
00:42:29,581 --> 00:42:31,682
- How's it going, Yuri?
- John

633
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:37,821
It takes Patience. So, how
much money you looking for?

634
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:39,690
$5,000.

635
00:42:39,691 --> 00:42:41,659
On the phone you said, $4,000.

636
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:45,162
I figured if I ask for four,
i should probably ask for five.

637
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,897
Right?

638
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:50,167
So, how you figure on paying
this monies back?

639
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:53,070
Yuri, it's me, Steve, you know
I'm good for it.

640
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,939
Whoa!

641
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:58,275
Wait, wait, wait.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

642
00:42:58,276 --> 00:43:03,045
A casio! I need this,
I'm awful with time.

643
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:10,788
Listen, you ever heard of the,
Belarus bowtie?

644
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,823
First you cut off the
testicles...

645
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:16,794
Then you shove them down throat.

646
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:19,096
Then you have incision here
and here.

647
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:25,002
You pop the balls out
and it looks like a...

648
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,136
Bowtie?

649
00:43:26,137 --> 00:43:28,371
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Very formal.

650
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,310
Listen, Stevie, I like you,
you're funny.

651
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:39,350
I loan you money, but you pay me
back or you have scrotum bowtie.

652
00:43:39,351 --> 00:43:41,017
"Ponimayu?"

653
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:45,756
Da. Scrotum bowtie.

654
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,360
Good luck. Thank you.

655
00:43:49,361 --> 00:43:51,227
See you soon.

656
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,301
So, Steve...

657
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,703
I just got off the phone with my
brokers and it turns out...

658
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:01,772
That the Chinese group that's
interested in buying...

659
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:04,308
My apartment complex is getting
a little skittish...

660
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:06,243
About the graffiti situation.

661
00:44:06,244 --> 00:44:09,647
Yeah... the graffiti situation
is getting skittishy.

662
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:13,217
They're cutting their offer
by half, Steve.

663
00:44:13,218 --> 00:44:15,185
So, here's the thing, okay?

664
00:44:15,186 --> 00:44:17,421
You find this graffiti kid
in the next two days...

665
00:44:17,422 --> 00:44:19,990
And you guarantee me no graffiti
through the end of escrow...

666
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,127
And I will sell you this house
for what I paid for it.

667
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:24,294
That's really generous, lew.

668
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,263
It is.

669
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:28,432
Look, the way I see it, you're
probably looking at a loss...

670
00:44:28,433 --> 00:44:32,069
Of eight figures if I don't
find this guy.

671
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,337
But if you don't want
my help, I understand.

672
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,972
Okay... I'm sure you...

673
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:37,274
Okay, okay, yeah, I get it,
okay.

674
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:40,177
Find the guy and I'll give
you the fuckin' house!

675
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:45,182
You see? Give, take, and
everybody's happy.

676
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:49,385
I'm not happy. This is not
happy. Catch the fucker.

677
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:04,034
Steve? Hi, it's John, sorry to
leave this on your voicemail...

678
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:07,137
But I'm just looking at a
picture of one of the murals...

679
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:11,809
From lew's building and, okay,
yes...

680
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:15,879
I give the piece as a whole,
seven out of ten.

681
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:19,083
The scrotum shading,
the veins...

682
00:45:19,084 --> 00:45:23,754
And it's like the whole thing
just follows you.

683
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,889
So, here's what I'm gonna do.

684
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,891
John I'm gonna go to all
the local art galleries...

685
00:45:27,892 --> 00:45:29,927
Show them the picture...

686
00:45:29,928 --> 00:45:32,930
Just try to absorb as much
cock as I can.

687
00:45:32,931 --> 00:45:37,968
In... ocularly, through my
eyes, not...

688
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:40,337
All right, well...

689
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:43,941
I'm gonna go hop on this and
I'll check in with you later.

690
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:46,676
Jesus, man, that was bad.

691
00:45:55,919 --> 00:46:00,457
Hey... I'm wondering if i
can ask you about an artist.

692
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,760
Sure. Okay.

693
00:46:02,761 --> 00:46:06,997
I gotta warn you,
it's a little racy.

694
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:10,968
Yes! Salvatore Lopez,
that's the artist.

695
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,970
Salvatore Lopez, are you sure?

696
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:14,538
I'm positive. You sure?

697
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:19,176
Yes. Look, you see how the
veins follow you?

698
00:46:19,177 --> 00:46:20,944
Yes, I do.

699
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:22,412
It's him.

700
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:25,382
And the, scrotal shading, it's...

701
00:46:25,383 --> 00:46:27,317
I mean, it's classic Salvatore.
Perfect.

702
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:29,086
Classic Salvatore?
Absolutely, yes.

703
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,455
Classic Salvatore... where can
i find him?

704
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:32,990
Why?

705
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:35,025
Just 'cause I'm a big fan...

706
00:46:35,026 --> 00:46:37,060
And I'm actually looking
to commission a mural.

707
00:46:37,061 --> 00:46:40,262
Okay, well, leave me your
number, I'll see what I can do.

708
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:47,337
Hey, spyder, got it, four grand.

709
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,473
Four grand. Where's my dog?

710
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:55,179
Bad news, fucker. Your dog's
gone.

711
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:58,115
Gone? How gone?

712
00:46:58,116 --> 00:47:00,484
All the way gone. Lupe, that
bitch, took him.

713
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:02,319
What are you talking about.
You just took my money!

714
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,555
Hey man, this was for the car,
the window and the garage.

715
00:47:04,556 --> 00:47:06,655
I was gonna throw the little
dog in for free.

716
00:47:09,226 --> 00:47:11,161
You think I'm some kind of
fucking idiot!?

717
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,429
Get me my dog or
I'm gonna go crazy!

718
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,337
The dog's just gone, is that it!

719
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:22,139
Hey, bro? Bro?

720
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:25,509
Don't think I don't have fucking
nice people in my house!

721
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,344
You really are crazy.

722
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,478
They've been to places that
you have never been to!

723
00:47:28,479 --> 00:47:29,580
I can see that, fucker.

724
00:47:29,581 --> 00:47:31,615
A lot of mental illness!

725
00:47:31,616 --> 00:47:33,383
Hey, that's Taylor's TV, bro.

726
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,854
What about Taylor!
What about Taylor!

727
00:47:36,855 --> 00:47:38,621
Yo. That's your little niece's
TV, bro.

728
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:43,526
Take a breath, bro.

729
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,871
Listen, that bitch lupe took
your dog?

730
00:47:53,872 --> 00:47:56,607
And a briefcase filled
with my cocaine.

731
00:47:56,608 --> 00:48:03,480
You find her, you get my shit,
I'll give you your money back.

732
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:09,386
How about this? How about I find
your girl and your briefcase...

733
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:14,324
Full of cocaine and you pay me
triple the money.

734
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,525
Psh!

735
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,566
Deal, fucker.

736
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:24,001
But you better do it now, before
my drugs find a new distributor.

737
00:48:24,002 --> 00:48:25,903
I'll get right on it.

738
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:29,538
Listen... wherever this bitch
is, your dog's there, too.

739
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:37,147
What? She likes knott's Berry
farms, Holmes.

740
00:48:37,148 --> 00:48:39,583
Knott's Berry farm's been closed
for a long time, hasn't it?

741
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,385
No, it's still open.

742
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:44,054
That other bitch in that picture
is her other sister, consuela...

743
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:47,057
She sometimes hangs out at my
cousin's bar, la patronca.

744
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:49,092
Got an address on that?

745
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,360
Fuckin' Google it, Holmes.

746
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,131
John I need you
to run some recon for me.

747
00:48:54,132 --> 00:48:55,365
Okay, pal?

748
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,134
The bar is la patronca...

749
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:58,702
We're looking for a girl
named consuela.

750
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:00,470
We find out where's she's
staying...

751
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:03,073
And that will lead us
to lupe and the coke.

752
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,407
And John, try not to stand out,
okay?

753
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:24,693
Hector! Goddammit, what'd I tell
you, you're not a fucking dj!

754
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:35,238
Hey there, amigo. Quite a
place you got here. Really nice.

755
00:49:35,239 --> 00:49:37,140
Um... to start...

756
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:40,744
I would like one of your finest
cervezas, por favor.

757
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:46,448
I believe $2.00 should do it.
I don't want no gringo prices.

758
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,893
My.

759
00:49:59,363 --> 00:50:00,963
Nice boots.

760
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:05,634
Thank you, thank you so much.

761
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:11,974
You can keep the change.

762
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:18,248
I'm also... I'm hoping
you know something...

763
00:50:18,249 --> 00:50:20,282
About this girl right here.

764
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:28,725
Jesus.

765
00:50:28,726 --> 00:50:31,728
Why you asking? You a cop?

766
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,663
No, no, I'm not a cop.

767
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,565
No, no, no, I'm just a friend,
I'm just looking for her.

768
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:39,902
She messing with you, too?

769
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,306
No, not that I know of.

770
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:46,642
No, it's nothing personal,
i just wanna talk to her.

771
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,679
Okay... just had to check.

772
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,284
Her name's consuela.

773
00:50:54,285 --> 00:50:56,420
She lives at the Hollywood
premiere motel...

774
00:50:56,421 --> 00:50:58,188
With her sister, lupe.

775
00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:04,728
Wow, okay... great,
that was a lot easier...

776
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:06,129
Than I thought it would be.

777
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,963
Thank you, gracias.

778
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,737
He spit that pit on your floor.

779
00:51:13,738 --> 00:51:18,075
You know what, that is
legitimately all I needed...

780
00:51:18,076 --> 00:51:20,077
To know, so... all right...

781
00:51:20,078 --> 00:51:22,813
I'm gonna let you keep that and
thank you so much for your time.

782
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:29,086
You can actually have the beer,
that's for you, my tip. Thanks.

783
00:51:29,087 --> 00:51:32,189
Be careful! She plays mind
games.

784
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,657
Okay.

785
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:35,492
Takes hours to respond to texts.

786
00:51:35,493 --> 00:51:37,327
Hello.

787
00:51:37,328 --> 00:51:40,464
One of the most annoying things
is that she'll make plans...

788
00:51:40,465 --> 00:51:42,599
And then cancel them, day of.

789
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,102
She'll invite you over to watch
a movie and then...

790
00:51:45,103 --> 00:51:46,503
Just wanna watch a movie!

791
00:51:46,504 --> 00:51:48,472
Okay. And she's a capricorn.

792
00:51:48,473 --> 00:51:50,240
Okay, I really, I gotta get
going.

793
00:51:50,241 --> 00:51:55,612
Yo, if you find her, tell her
rigaberto is thinking about her.

794
00:51:55,613 --> 00:52:00,884
I will. Good day, gentlemen.

795
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:03,453
John so, after my
stellar detective work...

796
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:04,855
I pointed Steve in the
direction...

797
00:52:04,856 --> 00:52:06,456
Of the Hollywood premiere
motel...

798
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:08,090
Where consuela was known
to frequent.

799
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,533
Damn! My god.

800
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:26,041
Hey, baby, I'm mocha.
You looking for a date?

801
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:30,647
I... I don't think so.

802
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:34,049
What... you some kind of fag
or something, sweetie?

803
00:52:34,784 --> 00:52:37,019
No! What would... how...

804
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,624
Mocha, maybe you could help me.

805
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,697
Have you seen this girl
right here?

806
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:50,233
What kind of Annie oakley
bullshit is that?

807
00:52:50,234 --> 00:52:52,802
Some kind of bullshit knott's
Berry farm picture.

808
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,437
I don't know.

809
00:52:54,438 --> 00:52:58,408
Well, that one's lupe,
I've seen her.

810
00:52:58,409 --> 00:53:00,243
Room 216.

811
00:53:00,244 --> 00:53:02,512
You didn't see a little dog,
too, did you?

812
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:04,781
That dog's got some
bowel problems.

813
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:06,416
He doesn't have any bowel
problems...

814
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:07,684
Well, he shits fuckin'
everywhere!

815
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,718
It's a nervous disorder.
Whatever.

816
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:15,725
Now, if you change your mind...
Mocha will turn you out.

817
00:53:15,726 --> 00:53:17,561
I will noodle on that.

818
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:20,197
I'm gonna noodle on you.
Trust me.

819
00:53:20,198 --> 00:53:22,831
You cute.

820
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,736
Okay, so, it is 8:36 P.M.

821
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:31,308
I've got my stakeout provisions
acquired...

822
00:53:31,309 --> 00:53:34,377
I am headed to the lookout
spot right now.

823
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:36,613
Time to kick the tires
and light the fire.

824
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:37,747
Hey. Hey.

825
00:53:37,748 --> 00:53:39,482
John, right? Yeah, hi...

826
00:53:39,483 --> 00:53:41,818
Hi.
I'm John, my name's John. Hello.

827
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:45,222
I know, we've met.
I just said your name.

828
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,224
Yeah, I'm sorry, I remember you,
I'm just...

829
00:53:47,225 --> 00:53:49,326
I'm not used to
people remembering me.

830
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,727
Well, how could I forget a guy
who followed me...

831
00:53:50,728 --> 00:53:52,295
Down a dark alley?

832
00:53:52,296 --> 00:53:55,298
I should have finished the job,
killed you there.

833
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:57,367
Sorry, I wouldn't kill you.

834
00:53:57,368 --> 00:54:01,004
By the way, were you just
talking to yourself?

835
00:54:01,005 --> 00:54:05,475
Yeah... no... no, I was talking
into my phone here.

836
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,277
I take field notes. Cool.

837
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,578
Yeah.

838
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,714
So, are you following
someone tonight?

839
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:15,752
Actually, yes.

840
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,554
I probably shouldn't be
mentioning this...

841
00:54:17,555 --> 00:54:21,558
But, yeah, I got a pretty sweet
case going on.

842
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:24,628
I'm following a graffiti artist
by the name of Salvatore Lopez.

843
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,263
Salvatore Lopez?

844
00:54:26,264 --> 00:54:27,497
Could be "salvatoré",
i don't really know.

845
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:29,799
I love him.

846
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,635
You do? You know him?

847
00:54:31,636 --> 00:54:34,638
Yeah, of course, he's like
the banksy of venice.

848
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:35,805
Right.

849
00:54:35,806 --> 00:54:37,507
I would love to see what
he looks like.

850
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:38,975
You and me both.

851
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:42,044
Do you want some company?

852
00:54:43,813 --> 00:54:47,651
Yes, but you know it's just...

853
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:49,786
I mean, it's a stakeout,
it's sitting in a car.

854
00:54:49,787 --> 00:54:52,722
I don't mind.

855
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:58,561
Okay. You have a very low bar
for a fun evening.

856
00:54:58,562 --> 00:54:59,929
Okay, my turn.

857
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:02,766
Fuck, marry, kill,
Ellen degeneres...

858
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:05,335
Oprah or Kelly ripa?

859
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:10,940
Okay, well, I'd fuck Oprah,
because she's beautiful.

860
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:16,479
She's a national treasure and if
i do it right, I'll get a car!

861
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,914
Look under your seats!

862
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:20,016
Then I guess I'd marry Ellen...

863
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,318
Just because of the sense
of humor...

864
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:22,986
You gotta want that in a wife.

865
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:26,423
And she's got an endless supply
of sneakers and suits.

866
00:55:26,424 --> 00:55:27,590
That's true.

867
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:29,926
And will dance the day away.

868
00:55:29,927 --> 00:55:34,898
And then, I guess, I'd have to
kill Kelly. Sweet, sweet ripa.

869
00:55:34,899 --> 00:55:38,868
Only because, that's the nature
of the game...

870
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:40,370
And someone's gotta die.

871
00:55:40,371 --> 00:55:41,738
It would probably scar me
for life...

872
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:43,940
It would ruin my marriage,
with Ellen, so...

873
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:46,108
That's fair.

874
00:55:50,348 --> 00:55:52,482
It's so crazy to me that you,

875
00:55:52,483 --> 00:55:55,518
That you know Salvatore
Lopez, that's...

876
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,955
Yeah, he's great, I mean, I love
the way he combines...

877
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:02,692
The Japanese theory of shuko
with a street-style aesthetic.

878
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:04,561
Yes, yes.

879
00:56:04,562 --> 00:56:08,498
Plus, his intimate knowledge
with the male anatomy.

880
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,799
It's very sensual.

881
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,320
And the way the veins follow
your eyes.

882
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,103
Yeah, yeah.

883
00:56:13,104 --> 00:56:15,771
And the scrotal shading.
Shut up.

884
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,344
You know, you're kind of cute.

885
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,851
Well, I've been told I'm a bit
of a young Roger daltrey...

886
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,018
If he spent a lot of time
with computers.

887
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:47,036
John...

888
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,271
Nola...

889
00:57:12,562 --> 00:57:14,664
Ooh, it's my little noodle.

890
00:57:14,665 --> 00:57:17,200
Hey. Ladies.

891
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:19,768
I like watching you walk away.

892
00:57:58,174 --> 00:58:03,213
Buddy! Aw, man, come on.
There you go.

893
00:58:03,214 --> 00:58:04,814
Did you miss me?

894
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:08,784
Aw, come here, pal...
Take a little rest.

895
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,192
What do you think you're doing
in my girl lupe's room?

896
00:58:16,193 --> 00:58:18,860
Dog Walker... they didn't
tell you?

897
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,165
You don't look like no dog
Walker to me.

898
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,434
Really?

899
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:30,238
That's all you got, baby?

900
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:38,715
See, I came to this town
with a dream...

901
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,750
Make-up artist to all the
stars and shit.

902
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:46,556
Then I got side-tracked
when I met Henry.

903
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:49,158
He was sweet as molasses.

904
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:52,060
He took good care of me.
Loved me for what I was.

905
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,267
Good man like that's
hard to find.

906
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:59,134
Don't I know it, girl.

907
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,872
What happened to him?

908
00:59:02,873 --> 00:59:04,873
I killed him.

909
00:59:07,877 --> 00:59:10,280
There... what do you think,
sugar?

910
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:12,982
I feel really special.

911
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,783
Yeah, I knew you would.

912
00:59:17,787 --> 00:59:21,991
You know what I think is next?

913
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,992
A ride home?

914
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,532
We gonna have to give you
a shave, baby.

915
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,605
I'll be right back.

916
00:59:35,606 --> 00:59:39,776
Come on, sweetness, let's move
little doggie to the bathroom...

917
00:59:39,777 --> 00:59:42,444
Before it shits all
over the bed.

918
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:57,961
Gonna have some fun...

919
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,929
Now, don't be wiggling
around on me...

920
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:04,166
'Cause I'd hate to cut off what
little you got down there, baby.

921
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,979
Here you go, buddy. Here boy,
here you go, pal, come here.

922
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,748
Come on, let's go. Here we go.

923
01:00:18,749 --> 01:00:21,283
Get your ass back here now!

924
01:00:22,218 --> 01:00:24,085
You broke my nose!

925
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:29,659
Girls!

926
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,828
Run, buddy, I'll find you!

927
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:33,061
Get him!

928
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:37,966
Bitch, come back here!
Come back here, motherfucker!

929
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:40,902
Let's get him!

930
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,273
Get that motherfucker!

931
01:00:54,283 --> 01:00:57,120
Come on, girls!
Let's get him! Get him!

932
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:59,487
We're gonna kick your ass!
Open that car!

933
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,591
Get out of that car right now!

934
01:01:11,434 --> 01:01:14,135
He was kinda cute.

935
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,084
Hey.

936
01:01:28,085 --> 01:01:30,053
Hello.

937
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:31,921
Hey, fellas, how you doing?

938
01:01:31,922 --> 01:01:34,257
You borrow money,
you pay money back.

939
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:36,259
Yeah, of course I do. So?

940
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,194
You gave me a week.
No, it's a day.

941
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:43,266
Yeah, but it's a week though,
right?

942
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:45,301
It's always a day.

943
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:46,969
It's one day, no?

944
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,304
It's always been a day.

945
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:51,040
Nice lipstick.

946
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,410
Yeah, it's my girlfriend's
lipstick.

947
01:01:54,411 --> 01:01:57,447
Brings out the color
in your eyes.

948
01:01:57,448 --> 01:01:59,749
So, a day? One day.

949
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,982
All right.

950
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,388
Remind him of the due date,

951
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:14,197
I'm pretty sure that's you,
lew...

952
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:16,132
I just don't know what
happened to you.

953
01:02:16,133 --> 01:02:18,167
I'm running out of time, okay?

954
01:02:18,168 --> 01:02:20,069
The Chinese are coming to visit
the building tomorrow.

955
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,505
It's a lucha libre wrestler...

956
01:02:22,506 --> 01:02:26,209
And I think he's tea-bagging
you, lew.

957
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,277
I'm gonna lose the sale, okay?

958
01:02:28,278 --> 01:02:30,813
Everything I worked for,
for fuck's sake!

959
01:02:30,814 --> 01:02:31,948
You said you were gonna take
care of this!

960
01:02:31,949 --> 01:02:33,216
All right, I got it, I got it...

961
01:02:33,217 --> 01:02:34,317
Okay? I'll take care of it.

962
01:02:34,318 --> 01:02:35,485
All right? Jesus Christ.

963
01:02:35,486 --> 01:02:37,120
Jesus Christ.

964
01:02:37,121 --> 01:02:42,492
Hey, lew, you think you could...
Loan me $5,000?

965
01:02:42,493 --> 01:02:44,961
You want me to lend you...
Fuck you!

966
01:02:44,962 --> 01:02:46,796
Steve!

967
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,498
And what happened to you?

968
01:02:48,499 --> 01:02:51,400
You were supposed to take care
of this.

969
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:56,037
Yeah, I know, I'm sorry,
i got... distracted.

970
01:02:58,341 --> 01:03:00,243
Just go find the graffiti
artist.

971
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:03,012
It's very creative.

972
01:03:03,013 --> 01:03:06,114
I've never even imagined
tea-bagging someone like that.

973
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,617
I'll...

974
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,977
Hey, Dave.

975
01:03:34,978 --> 01:03:39,148
You're drinking alone
and the sun's still up.

976
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:41,984
I've been evicted from my
own house.

977
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:44,053
I'm sorry to hear that.

978
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:46,122
You know I'm there for you.

979
01:03:46,123 --> 01:03:48,057
I know.

980
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,593
Promise me that you'll let
me be there.

981
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:55,430
Fine. I'll let you be there.

982
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:04,440
Listen, I count on you to be
the ballast in my life.

983
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:07,577
I need you to turn this
thing around.

984
01:04:07,578 --> 01:04:11,280
I'm there for you.

985
01:04:11,281 --> 01:04:13,850
So, about that five grand
plus interest I need...

986
01:04:13,851 --> 01:04:15,650
So Yuri doesn't kill me.

987
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:24,460
From the closing sale
at the shop.

988
01:04:24,461 --> 01:04:25,561
Wow.

989
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:28,331
Me dinero es su dinero.

990
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:31,167
Thanks, man. Thank you.

991
01:04:31,168 --> 01:04:34,470
Really, thank you.

992
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:36,939
So, you are learning to let go?

993
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,441
I'm letting go, all right.

994
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:44,145
Here... crash at my place.

995
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,148
Yeah. Thanks.

996
01:04:54,123 --> 01:04:55,658
Hey, Yuri.

997
01:04:55,659 --> 01:04:57,560
Hey.

998
01:04:57,561 --> 01:05:00,263
Thank you very much, very much.

999
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:01,497
You're welcome.

1000
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:03,532
You're a man of your word, da?

1001
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,534
You, too. I appreciate it.

1002
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:09,572
Listen, don't borrow any money
from me?

1003
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:11,240
It's dangerous.

1004
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,042
Right. Thank you.

1005
01:05:13,043 --> 01:05:15,677
All right, thanks again.
Come on, ladies.

1006
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:23,252
Hey, Steve? Hey, hold on.

1007
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:27,623
Hold on. Wait for it.
Yes, I got him!

1008
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:28,624
John I got Salvatore.

1009
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:30,192
What?

1010
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:31,260
Yeah, I was looking right
at him.

1011
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,362
And... just...

1012
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:37,300
I don't know if this changes
anything, but he's not latino.

1013
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,635
Well, 'cause Salvatore Lopez,
right?

1014
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:42,071
But he's not, he's black.

1015
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:43,572
All right, I'll see you
in a little bit.

1016
01:05:43,573 --> 01:05:45,174
That doesn't make me a racist...

1017
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:48,377
I just thought you might...
I'll be here.

1018
01:05:48,378 --> 01:05:50,211
Jesus.

1019
01:06:02,391 --> 01:06:06,429
You must be Salvatore. Yeah.

1020
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:08,264
So?

1021
01:06:08,265 --> 01:06:11,367
How much does this one go for?

1022
01:06:11,368 --> 01:06:13,369
$10,000.

1023
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:15,304
I'll tell you what, I'll give
you five dollars for this...

1024
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:17,473
And keep you from going to jail.

1025
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:19,175
Jail?

1026
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,710
Man, I think you should
get the fuck out of here.

1027
01:06:20,711 --> 01:06:22,310
What's that? What's that?

1028
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:25,680
Hold still, jerkoff.

1029
01:06:27,049 --> 01:06:28,651
You painted the top
of my head blue.

1030
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,319
You remember?

1031
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,520
Now you're gonna tell me
everything you know.

1032
01:06:39,028 --> 01:06:42,430
Hey, fuck you, man.
This paint don't come off.

1033
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:51,073
What... what... what'd you
write on his face?

1034
01:06:51,074 --> 01:06:53,042
Or did you just stomp him?

1035
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:55,044
Dude, what is with you
and all the violence?

1036
01:06:55,045 --> 01:06:56,779
Aw, shit.

1037
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,281
Hey, look who it is.

1038
01:06:59,282 --> 01:07:01,217
What's up, cholos?

1039
01:07:01,218 --> 01:07:03,486
Where's my shit?

1040
01:07:03,487 --> 01:07:04,787
Yeah, where's his shit?

1041
01:07:04,788 --> 01:07:08,224
Dude, I'm standing right here.

1042
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:09,558
I can hear every word he says.

1043
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,293
Shut the fuck up! Hey, hey...

1044
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:12,762
Don't talk to him like that...
You shut the fuck up!

1045
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:14,430
I'm cool, I'm cool.
We're all good.

1046
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:16,432
You and your dog's time
is running out.

1047
01:07:16,433 --> 01:07:18,434
You didn't find lupe yet,
did you?

1048
01:07:18,435 --> 01:07:20,036
You're the one that's supposed
to be looking.

1049
01:07:20,037 --> 01:07:21,270
I want my shit back!

1050
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:23,339
I want my dog back.

1051
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:26,342
Whoa, jeez. Great.

1052
01:07:26,343 --> 01:07:29,412
You got 24 hours, Holmes.

1053
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:31,180
I'm gonna come find you.

1054
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:33,149
Have fun.

1055
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,085
You probably don't care but,
um... you're saying, "24"...

1056
01:07:36,086 --> 01:07:39,088
But your hands are actually
saying, "42."

1057
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:41,690
I know when I do my gang
gestures...

1058
01:07:41,691 --> 01:07:43,426
I like to practice
in the mirror.

1059
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:46,861
See this watch? This watch is
shit. Fuck your watch!

1060
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:56,037
What's the matter with you?

1061
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,424
You might want to get out
of the house once in a while.

1062
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:17,460
I know.

1063
01:08:17,461 --> 01:08:19,261
What are you doing?

1064
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:21,630
I gotta go steal back some drugs
for these gang guys...

1065
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:23,466
So I can get my dog back.

1066
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:26,235
But first I gotta go shake up
these real estate assholes.

1067
01:08:26,236 --> 01:08:28,771
Cool.

1068
01:08:28,772 --> 01:08:29,872
Wanna come?

1069
01:08:29,873 --> 01:08:31,373
Yeah!

1070
01:08:31,374 --> 01:08:32,808
Sounds like fun.

1071
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:34,542
Could be dangerous.

1072
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,912
Maybe I'll die.

1073
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:47,423
Hi, we're here to see
Mr. Carter.

1074
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:48,791
Do you have an appointment?

1075
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:53,129
No, just tell him we represent
lew the Jew.

1076
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:54,430
Lew the Jew?

1077
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:57,333
Lew the Jew. Hurry up.

1078
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:59,367
Just a moment.

1079
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:02,338
Hurry up?

1080
01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:03,706
No more Patience.

1081
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:06,642
Have a mint.

1082
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:08,644
How can I help you, gentlemen?

1083
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,112
You are so fucked.

1084
01:09:13,749 --> 01:09:15,684
I'm sorry, excuse me?

1085
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:18,687
This about money?
It's always about money.

1086
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,457
It's lew the Jew,
come on, you need a few bucks?

1087
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,626
No, don't need money.

1088
01:09:23,627 --> 01:09:26,562
But here is the deal we are
gonna make you.

1089
01:09:26,563 --> 01:09:30,266
You are gonna make lew the Jew
a very generous offer...

1090
01:09:30,267 --> 01:09:33,235
For all the shit that you've
done to his apartment building.

1091
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,171
We were thinking $22 million.

1092
01:09:35,172 --> 01:09:38,407
22... $22 million?

1093
01:09:38,408 --> 01:09:43,279
And you are gonna give Dave
here a brand new condo.

1094
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:46,315
One bedroom and a den.

1095
01:09:46,316 --> 01:09:48,884
Right on the beach, for free.

1096
01:09:48,885 --> 01:09:52,288
Okay, this... is a moment
for me to call the police.

1097
01:09:52,289 --> 01:09:53,656
Excuse me.

1098
01:09:53,657 --> 01:09:55,691
Good, well, you can show
them this...

1099
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,961
Because right there,
that is a signed...

1100
01:09:58,962 --> 01:10:00,462
Notarized.

1101
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:04,200
Sworn affidavit by
a Salvatore Lopez...

1102
01:10:04,201 --> 01:10:07,469
The graffiti artist that
you hired to paint all over...

1103
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,272
Lew the Jew's buildings,
so the Chinese would drop...

1104
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:12,408
Their offer and you could buy
for less.

1105
01:10:12,409 --> 01:10:13,976
So, we have a deal, right?

1106
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:18,045
Or am I gonna have to put your
head through that fucking wall?

1107
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:26,589
There, there you go, fellas.
You have a good day, all right?

1108
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:28,055
Bye, bye.

1109
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:50,246
You're short.

1110
01:10:50,247 --> 01:10:52,248
What? You're short.

1111
01:10:52,249 --> 01:10:54,849
That's all prince gave me
for that stuff.

1112
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,654
I swear.

1113
01:10:58,655 --> 01:11:01,522
Oscar, I would never lie to you.

1114
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:10,832
I gotta get back to spyder's
before he suspects anything.

1115
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:16,838
What happens if spyder
finds out?

1116
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,674
Fuck spyder.

1117
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,447
Where are you taking my dog?
I found him out back.

1118
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,449
He's my dog now.

1119
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:28,584
What?

1120
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:30,352
Just stay here.

1121
01:11:30,353 --> 01:11:32,220
Pinche loco.

1122
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,897
Time to go.

1123
01:11:41,898 --> 01:11:46,200
Fuck Oscar and fuck spyder.

1124
01:11:56,045 --> 01:11:59,948
Bonus! What gives?

1125
01:11:59,949 --> 01:12:03,684
Some "just in case" stuff.
I guess.

1126
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,891
Wow, where'd you get this?
Some drug lord?

1127
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:11,927
Nah. You remember Dana kaminski?

1128
01:12:11,928 --> 01:12:13,028
Yeah.

1129
01:12:13,029 --> 01:12:14,797
Well, her old man was a cop.

1130
01:12:14,798 --> 01:12:16,098
Sweet.

1131
01:12:16,099 --> 01:12:17,733
Grenade? Yeah.

1132
01:12:17,734 --> 01:12:19,767
Cool. Thank you.

1133
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,339
Knuckle duster? Yep.

1134
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,040
Ninja throwing star? Yeah.

1135
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:28,610
You sure you want to do this?

1136
01:12:28,611 --> 01:12:31,847
What else have I got to do?
I'm with you.

1137
01:12:31,848 --> 01:12:35,249
To the hounds. Nice.

1138
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:06,982
You got a flat tire.

1139
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:08,550
What?

1140
01:13:08,551 --> 01:13:10,552
Are you kidding me?

1141
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,987
Well, fix the fucking thing.

1142
01:13:11,988 --> 01:13:14,423
Gigi don't fix no tires.

1143
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:15,791
Shit.

1144
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:19,461
Fix the fucking thing
or we're gonna be late.

1145
01:13:19,462 --> 01:13:22,765
Fine. Hurry up, okay?

1146
01:13:22,766 --> 01:13:24,533
Hurry up. Bitch.

1147
01:13:24,534 --> 01:13:27,068
- What?
- You heard me.

1148
01:13:33,876 --> 01:13:35,843
Awesome.

1149
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:39,847
What the hell's taking so long,
girl?

1150
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,686
I'll take that. Okay.

1151
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:48,590
Where's my dog?

1152
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:50,893
Spyder has him.

1153
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,827
I swear.

1154
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:56,698
Hi, I'm Dave.

1155
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:58,934
I just electrocuted the shit
out of your friend.

1156
01:13:58,935 --> 01:14:00,803
He's taking a little nap
in the trunk.

1157
01:14:00,804 --> 01:14:03,705
I want you to try these
bracelets on.

1158
01:14:03,706 --> 01:14:06,040
They're free.

1159
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:16,518
Where's the rest of the coke?

1160
01:14:16,519 --> 01:14:18,520
That's all there was.

1161
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:22,624
Ooh, a shot to the knee cap,
that's... that's gonna hurt.

1162
01:14:22,625 --> 01:14:24,526
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

1163
01:14:24,527 --> 01:14:27,529
I sold it to this guy,
black dude, prince.

1164
01:14:27,530 --> 01:14:30,098
Where can I find him?

1165
01:14:30,099 --> 01:14:34,068
He's always at this bar
called bird cage.

1166
01:14:39,808 --> 01:14:41,910
You're very cute.

1167
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:44,780
Where are you going?
You can't leave me here!

1168
01:14:44,781 --> 01:14:48,116
Don't worry, we're gonna
call the 9-1-1 for you...

1169
01:14:48,117 --> 01:14:49,751
As soon as we scamper off.

1170
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:52,020
Enjoy prison.

1171
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:54,590
What? Pinches gringos!

1172
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,424
Hey!

1173
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:06,235
Okay, you ready?

1174
01:15:06,236 --> 01:15:09,638
I've got a boner for the first
time in a year.

1175
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:14,341
I have no real response
to that statement.

1176
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:17,946
Hey, man, how you doing?

1177
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:19,081
Fuck you.

1178
01:15:19,082 --> 01:15:20,649
Is there a cover?

1179
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:22,117
Fuck you.

1180
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:24,520
Prince is expecting us.

1181
01:15:24,521 --> 01:15:26,188
What's in the case?

1182
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,356
A lot of money to buy cocaine.

1183
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:34,863
I was planning on using that
later.

1184
01:15:34,864 --> 01:15:36,765
Is there a back door
to this place?

1185
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,100
Man, fuck you.

1186
01:15:40,736 --> 01:15:42,571
Thanks very much.
You're really good.

1187
01:15:42,572 --> 01:15:44,872
Fuck you.

1188
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:00,956
Manhattan, neat,

1189
01:16:00,957 --> 01:16:02,857
vodka tonic.

1190
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:07,361
Do you need me to walk you
through that?

1191
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,333
Whoa... not so fast.

1192
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:15,903
We're here to see prince.
Spyder sent us.

1193
01:16:17,739 --> 01:16:21,809
Spyder? But Oscar
sent some girl over yesterday.

1194
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:24,979
Hang on.

1195
01:16:29,318 --> 01:16:33,088
He said they'd see you, but they
hope you know what you're doing.

1196
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:34,990
It's that door down at the end
of the hall.

1197
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:36,390
Thanks.

1198
01:16:42,332 --> 01:16:44,666
John prince is a
modern-day entrepreneur...

1199
01:16:44,667 --> 01:16:47,769
Money laundering,
prostitution, drug dealing...

1200
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,338
What doesn't this guy do?

1201
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:51,872
These two look the fuck
out of place.

1202
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,277
What the hell are these cats...

1203
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,183
Yo, yo, yo, who the fuck
are you?

1204
01:17:01,184 --> 01:17:02,284
I'm Steve.

1205
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:03,352
I'm Dave.

1206
01:17:03,353 --> 01:17:04,953
Okay, okay, first thing...

1207
01:17:04,954 --> 01:17:06,688
You gotta give me the card
for that dj, man.

1208
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:08,924
He is playing some
great music out there.

1209
01:17:08,925 --> 01:17:12,194
Came here to talk to me
about the motherfucking dj?

1210
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:13,996
You a crazy motherfucker.

1211
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:16,798
All right, well, so enough
with the talking and shit...

1212
01:17:16,799 --> 01:17:17,899
Open the case.

1213
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:20,068
Yeah, just show me the stuff.

1214
01:17:20,069 --> 01:17:21,703
Just open the case.

1215
01:17:21,704 --> 01:17:23,639
Show me the stuff.
Just open the case.

1216
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,873
Show us the stuff.
Open the case.

1217
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:26,241
Show us the fucking stuff!

1218
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:27,943
Motherfucker, open the
motherfucking case.

1219
01:17:27,944 --> 01:17:29,344
Show us the motherfucking stuff!

1220
01:17:29,345 --> 01:17:31,079
Open the motherfucking case,
Steve!

1221
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,320
What are... what are you doing?
Kill these motherfuckers.

1222
01:17:34,282 --> 01:17:36,183
Shit!

1223
01:17:38,120 --> 01:17:40,055
Now the thing you need to do
is sit there real quiet...

1224
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:41,690
And just sit back.

1225
01:17:41,691 --> 01:17:42,858
I'm just gonna hold this up
to your neck.

1226
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,326
Okay, be very cool.

1227
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:47,094
We're gonna stand up, you ready?
Come on.

1228
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:50,332
Shit just got real.

1229
01:17:50,333 --> 01:17:52,934
You, put your gun down,
put your gun down.

1230
01:17:52,935 --> 01:17:57,438
Take that cocaine, put it
in our case and shut it.

1231
01:18:01,143 --> 01:18:03,944
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

1232
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,183
Here we go, nice and easy.

1233
01:18:08,184 --> 01:18:11,186
Nice and easy, watch your step.
You're in control, boss.

1234
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:12,421
Fuck you.

1235
01:18:12,422 --> 01:18:13,455
Dave, you got this?

1236
01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:15,424
I got it.

1237
01:18:15,425 --> 01:18:19,426
Good, easy, don't move, don't
fucking move, you hear me?

1238
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:25,167
It was nice meeting you,
all of you!

1239
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,035
Hold on to this.

1240
01:18:27,036 --> 01:18:29,937
Shit! Shit!

1241
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,946
Fuck.

1242
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:53,228
The fuck y'all running to?

1243
01:18:53,229 --> 01:18:57,097
You motherfuckers fired!
All of y'all are fired.

1244
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:04,740
That's right,
it's the muffin man.

1245
01:19:04,741 --> 01:19:06,341
Oscar you find that cocaine?

1246
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:08,043
Just put spyder on the phone!
Go fuck yourself!

1247
01:19:08,044 --> 01:19:10,278
No, I will not go
fuck myself, Oscar.

1248
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,481
Just tell spyder that I got
his coke...

1249
01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:14,883
And I want my dog and my money,
all right?

1250
01:19:14,884 --> 01:19:18,987
So I'll be over there tonight.
All right, goodbye.

1251
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,889
Well, that was easy.

1252
01:19:20,890 --> 01:19:24,059
Yeah, easy getting in,
not so easy getting out.

1253
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,761
It sure smells like a set-up.

1254
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,028
You got a plan?

1255
01:19:27,029 --> 01:19:30,031
Of course, I got a plan.

1256
01:19:30,032 --> 01:19:32,167
You see what's happening here,
don't you?

1257
01:19:32,168 --> 01:19:36,138
For the first time in your life,
katey and Taylor...

1258
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:40,408
You're putting them and their
needs before your own.

1259
01:19:40,409 --> 01:19:43,979
Now me, I'm doing the totally
opposite thing.

1260
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:46,281
I'm putting my needs
before anyone else's...

1261
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:48,015
For the first time in my life.

1262
01:19:49,951 --> 01:19:54,121
I've become you, and you've
become me.

1263
01:19:55,824 --> 01:19:57,492
It's a little right on the nose,
isn't it, Dave?

1264
01:19:57,493 --> 01:19:59,693
Sure, but I didn't have much
time with it.

1265
01:20:01,998 --> 01:20:04,933
Great news! Jesus!
It's me, it's okay.

1266
01:20:04,934 --> 01:20:06,368
What the fuck are you doing
here, John?

1267
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:10,304
I have something for you guys.

1268
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,376
Hi, guys.

1269
01:20:14,377 --> 01:20:16,878
Fellas, you're a day early...

1270
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:19,314
The luau has been changed
'til tomorrow.

1271
01:20:19,315 --> 01:20:20,382
Fuck you!

1272
01:20:20,383 --> 01:20:22,317
Hey, manu? Just... please.

1273
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:23,819
Sorry. Okay?

1274
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,352
Sorry. It's okay.

1275
01:20:26,555 --> 01:20:31,059
Listen, we are here to apologize
to you, Steve...

1276
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,128
For kicking the shit out of you.

1277
01:20:33,129 --> 01:20:35,062
Yeah, little dude says we
should.

1278
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:39,201
Why are you listening to the
little dude?

1279
01:20:39,202 --> 01:20:41,635
He's dating our sister.

1280
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:45,540
How many sisters do you have?

1281
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:48,977
Only one.

1282
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:52,881
Yeah, yeah, it just happened,
just crazy chemistry...

1283
01:20:52,882 --> 01:20:54,616
Just right off the bat.

1284
01:20:54,617 --> 01:20:59,187
Just very... very heated, in a
respectable way, just modest...

1285
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:01,389
Modests, hot modests.

1286
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:03,525
Why didn't you just beat
the shit out of him?

1287
01:21:03,526 --> 01:21:05,360
Momma likes him.

1288
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,162
You met Nola's mom?

1289
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:11,199
Yeah, yeah, just yesterday,
actually... a very lovely lunch.

1290
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:14,202
Joan... is a wonderful cook.

1291
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:19,606
And it turns out, we both have a
passion for vintage cinema, so...

1292
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:24,613
So we're all good here?

1293
01:21:24,614 --> 01:21:26,581
Yeah, we're cool.

1294
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,483
And?

1295
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:33,321
We owe you, Steve, and if
there's anything you need...

1296
01:21:33,322 --> 01:21:35,089
You could come see us.

1297
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:39,494
What are you guys doing
right now?

1298
01:21:39,495 --> 01:21:41,029
John I know
I'm in the minority here...

1299
01:21:41,030 --> 01:21:42,464
But I don't love gun battles...

1300
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:44,966
At creepy, drug-cartel trap
houses.

1301
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:47,035
If anything, I'm more
of an "au natural"...

1302
01:21:47,036 --> 01:21:49,104
Hand-to-hand combat kind of guy.

1303
01:21:49,105 --> 01:21:52,974
So, I just sat this one out and
headed back to the office.

1304
01:21:52,975 --> 01:21:56,243
You know, to do office stuff.

1305
01:22:10,091 --> 01:22:14,229
Here you go, buddy. Hold tight,
okay, come on.

1306
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:16,296
Ssh, let's get out of here.

1307
01:22:33,581 --> 01:22:35,315
Right?

1308
01:22:38,654 --> 01:22:40,587
Whoa!

1309
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:46,628
Not much of a plan,
if I can say that.

1310
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:51,032
Stay here with the coke.
I'm gonna try and get buddy.

1311
01:22:51,033 --> 01:22:52,467
Keep your head down.

1312
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,801
Picked the right man
for the job.

1313
01:22:58,640 --> 01:23:00,240
Get some!

1314
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,850
Fuck you.

1315
01:23:15,023 --> 01:23:16,992
What the fuck, Holmes?

1316
01:23:16,993 --> 01:23:18,460
It's that muffin motherfucker,
man!

1317
01:23:18,461 --> 01:23:20,195
He's back, took a shot at me!

1318
01:23:20,196 --> 01:23:22,729
Watch the windows, I'll find
that muffinfucker!

1319
01:23:38,413 --> 01:23:41,582
Drop the gun.

1320
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:51,059
Does spyder know you and lupe stole all
the drugs? And you've been fucking her?

1321
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:52,559
Where's my coke, bitch?

1322
01:23:57,632 --> 01:24:03,637
You lying motherfucker.

1323
01:24:15,784 --> 01:24:18,453
Now what?

1324
01:24:18,454 --> 01:24:21,423
We had a deal... your doggie and
the money for my cocaine.

1325
01:24:21,424 --> 01:24:22,490
Yeah.

1326
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:24,459
You got my coke?

1327
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:26,260
It's on it's way.

1328
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:31,066
Bring it on, motherfucker!

1329
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:33,201
Dave, Dave!
What the fuck are you doing?

1330
01:24:33,202 --> 01:24:35,703
I'm completely out of control.

1331
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:40,408
All right, that's our guy.

1332
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,610
Is that for me?

1333
01:24:42,611 --> 01:24:46,280
Yes, here we go.
I got it, I got it.

1334
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:55,423
Dude... okay. Thank you.

1335
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:03,997
Hang on to that.

1336
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:27,789
There he is, come here.

1337
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:30,558
Buddy! I missed you so much!

1338
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:32,827
You been feeding my dog?

1339
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:36,197
Pedigree, lamb and rice blend,
he loves that shit.

1340
01:25:36,198 --> 01:25:39,567
Yeah, he does. Thanks for
looking after him.

1341
01:25:39,568 --> 01:25:42,370
No problem.

1342
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:43,705
We cool?

1343
01:25:43,706 --> 01:25:47,609
Cool. See you down the road,
Holmes.

1344
01:25:47,610 --> 01:25:50,178
All right, okay.

1345
01:25:50,179 --> 01:25:53,380
Not a bad fella, that spyder.

1346
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,722
John so, Steve got the job done.

1347
01:26:00,723 --> 01:26:03,491
Was it unorthodox in execution?
Sure.

1348
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:05,460
Should he see someone about
multiple concussions...

1349
01:26:05,461 --> 01:26:07,929
In a span of 24 hours?
Definitely.

1350
01:26:07,930 --> 01:26:10,598
Could he benefit from maybe
a therapist to help him...

1351
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:12,534
Sort out some of his many
issues?

1352
01:26:12,535 --> 01:26:13,935
That's not for me to say.

1353
01:26:13,936 --> 01:26:18,840
The main thing is... Steve got
his dog back.

1354
01:26:18,841 --> 01:26:23,678
Lew the Jew made good on his
deal, and me, I got the girl.

1355
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:26,414
Never thought I'd get
to say that.

1356
01:26:26,415 --> 01:26:28,749
She's all yours.

1357
01:26:30,451 --> 01:26:31,886
You, take good care of her,

1358
01:26:31,887 --> 01:26:33,488
I will, lew.

1359
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:34,622
Okay.

1360
01:26:34,623 --> 01:26:35,723
Thank you very much.

1361
01:26:35,724 --> 01:26:37,926
Yeah.

1362
01:26:37,927 --> 01:26:40,862
You did the right thing.

1363
01:26:40,863 --> 01:26:42,696
Nah.

1364
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,574
Hey. Hey.

1365
01:26:52,575 --> 01:26:57,979
Hi, baby. Do you like your new
room?

1366
01:26:57,980 --> 01:27:04,485
My new room is pretty amazing.
Thanks, uncle Steve.

1367
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:07,854
You're welcome. Have a good time
today.

1368
01:27:10,258 --> 01:27:13,560
Thought you might want that.

1369
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,131
Thank you.

1370
01:27:23,972 --> 01:27:25,740
Hot moo!

1371
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:29,377
Moo!

1372
01:27:29,378 --> 01:27:31,312
I'll take a steak.

1373
01:27:31,313 --> 01:27:37,184
John either way,
everyone is happy. Case closed.

1374
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,256
Hello.

1375
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:43,156
John Steve, it's me, it's John.

1376
01:27:44,826 --> 01:27:46,661
I can't hear you very well.
Here, I got you.

1377
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:48,930
Who is this? It's John.

1378
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:51,532
Yeah, look, I know everyone
is probably looking forward...

1379
01:27:51,533 --> 01:27:56,638
To my world-famous pasta salad,
but I won't be able to make it.

1380
01:27:56,639 --> 01:27:58,373
Steve
so I invite you to my party...

1381
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:00,008
And you're not gonna bring
anything?

1382
01:28:00,009 --> 01:28:02,043
No, no, I won't be able
to attend the barbeque...

1383
01:28:02,044 --> 01:28:03,711
Pasta salad's already made.

1384
01:28:03,712 --> 01:28:05,513
Okay, no worries, pal,
I'll see you tomorrow.

1385
01:28:05,514 --> 01:28:08,616
Well, yeah...

1386
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:13,720
Hello? Steve?

1387
01:28:16,024 --> 01:28:17,992
I believe he hung up.

1388
01:28:17,993 --> 01:28:21,462
That's terrible, because if
he's not gonna come to us...

1389
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:22,730
Now we gotta go to him...

1390
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:25,165
Which means you need
to tell us where he is.

1391
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:30,371
No... no, I won't.

1392
01:28:30,372 --> 01:28:33,441
So, you're just gonna have
to find him...

1393
01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:34,909
And you won't be able
to find Steve.

1394
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:37,512
Not in venice, he knows every
nook and cranny...

1395
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:39,447
In this neighborhood.

1396
01:28:39,448 --> 01:28:42,750
He'll disappear, he's got
friends in high places...

1397
01:28:42,751 --> 01:28:44,719
And got friends in low places.

1398
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,355
I didn't mean to quote that
country song right now...

1399
01:28:47,356 --> 01:28:50,358
But the point is, if he even
gets a whiff of trouble...

1400
01:28:50,359 --> 01:28:52,560
He'll turn into a ghost.

1401
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:54,562
Not literally, obviously, but...

1402
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:59,434
Hold on. Clancy, rewind that
shit back like a minute.

1403
01:28:59,435 --> 01:29:04,405
What's the address of that house
we scored from lew the Jew?

1404
01:29:04,406 --> 01:29:06,674
John I'm
standing in Steve's parents'...

1405
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,110
House at 845 Holland canal...

1406
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:11,379
The one with the white picket
fence.

1407
01:29:11,380 --> 01:29:13,381
I think it's mid-century.

1408
01:29:13,382 --> 01:29:15,416
Really? And you know,
it's perfect timing...

1409
01:29:15,417 --> 01:29:20,054
Because I'm starving... and
i really love pasta salad.

1410
01:29:20,055 --> 01:29:21,956
I hear yours is world-renowned.

1411
01:29:23,425 --> 01:29:25,693
You guys hungry? Y'all ready to
go eat?

1412
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,663
Yeah, okay? We're going to a
party, white boy.

1413
01:29:28,664 --> 01:29:30,830
God. Please don't.

1414
01:29:32,800 --> 01:29:34,936
Actually... let's go.

1415
01:29:34,937 --> 01:29:38,271
Thank you... thank you for not
shooting my balls.

1416
01:29:44,580 --> 01:29:47,747
Okay, well, I'll just be here.

1417
01:30:49,677 --> 01:30:51,645
No.
