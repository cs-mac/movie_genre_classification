1
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:39,770
The most high and mighty sovereign...

2
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:42,964
...Elizabeth, by the grace of God...

3
00:02:43,141 --> 00:02:45,268
...queen of England.

4
00:02:50,482 --> 00:02:52,643
Mary. Randolph.

5
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:57,581
Look alive, milord,
are you glued to the floor?

6
00:02:57,756 --> 00:02:59,587
Get up! Get up!

7
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,259
- Has something upset Your Majesty?
- Throckmorton, tell them.

8
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:13,665
Milords...

9
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:17,639
...Mary Stuart has sailed from France
for Scotland.

10
00:03:19,377 --> 00:03:21,106
What are we to do?

11
00:03:21,279 --> 00:03:24,180
Did Your Majesty grant her
England's safe conduct at sea?

12
00:03:24,349 --> 00:03:25,611
No!

13
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:28,446
She defied my ambassador, defied me...

14
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,589
...refused to acknowledge
that I am the rightful queen of England.

15
00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:36,751
- 'Tis true, milord.
- Now she shows her true colors.

16
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:41,926
Suppose she lands...

17
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,830
...what then?
- Her presence in Scotland will endanger...

18
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:50,464
...Your Majesty's throne, naturally.
But she is the legitimate heir of Henry Vll...

19
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:54,942
...and her claims to succeed Your Majesty
must be acknowledged.

20
00:03:55,113 --> 00:03:58,082
Not by me. Never.

21
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:03,244
I should fail in my duty to Your Majesty
if I did not state facts.

22
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:06,549
We must face the fact that,
in the eyes of Europe...

23
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:10,092
...you are a pretender
to the throne of England.

24
00:04:10,262 --> 00:04:14,028
Because the marriage of your father,
Henry Vlll...

25
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:17,657
...to your mother, Anne Boleyn...

26
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,861
...is deemed invalid.

27
00:04:20,505 --> 00:04:22,905
They call me "illegitimate. " Go on.

28
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:25,602
That being faced...

29
00:04:25,777 --> 00:04:30,009
...Mary Stuart must not be allowed
to land in Scotland.

30
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:34,414
She will use that throne
as a stepping stone to yours.

31
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:37,719
She must be seized at sea.

32
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,686
By English ships, Your Majesty?

33
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,122
But that would offend France,
offend all Europe.

34
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:46,959
Have I no captain who can raise
a black flag on occasion?

35
00:04:47,132 --> 00:04:49,930
They do it often enough when I forbid it.

36
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,707
- What happened, Randolph?
- Hawkins. Drake.

37
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,677
What did she say?

38
00:06:25,964 --> 00:06:28,364
Oh, Heavenly Father...

39
00:06:28,533 --> 00:06:32,128
...I give thee thanks
for the security of this voyage...

40
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,398
...which has brought us safely
to my native land.

41
00:06:37,108 --> 00:06:39,269
Counsel my heart.

42
00:06:40,211 --> 00:06:43,510
Guide my steps in this land of my birth...

43
00:06:43,682 --> 00:06:46,378
...that I may rule with piety...

44
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:48,382
...and wisdom.

45
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:10,502
The queen is coming! Prepare yourselves!

46
00:07:11,142 --> 00:07:14,839
The queen is coming!
The queen is coming!

47
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:32,964
- Quiet!
- No! I've had enough...

48
00:07:33,765 --> 00:07:34,993
Calm down!

49
00:07:47,712 --> 00:07:49,441
- Milord.
- Yes?

50
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:52,845
Your sister Mary, Queen of Scots,
she's on her way to Edinburgh.

51
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,410
You're daft, man!

52
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:59,079
But I've seen her. She landed at Leith.
She'll be here most any moment.

53
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:09,990
Your regency's over, Moray!

54
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:12,966
- You'll step down now.
- Aye.

55
00:08:13,171 --> 00:08:15,401
No longer you'll rule Scotland!

56
00:08:17,108 --> 00:08:18,336
Milords.

57
00:08:19,144 --> 00:08:22,602
We'd better go down and meet her.

58
00:08:22,781 --> 00:08:24,339
No.

59
00:08:24,516 --> 00:08:26,381
You'll wait here.

60
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:29,049
You've gathered here to welcome her.

61
00:08:29,354 --> 00:08:31,322
Understand?

62
00:08:35,226 --> 00:08:36,523
And another thing:

63
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:39,663
Remember, you lords are
the real power of Scotland.

64
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,958
You can afford to hold your tongues.

65
00:08:42,133 --> 00:08:46,900
I warn you, leave all speech to Lexington,
especially you, Ruthven and Morton.

66
00:09:40,825 --> 00:09:42,053
Your Majesty.

67
00:09:43,862 --> 00:09:45,227
James.

68
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,023
James Stuart.

69
00:09:49,534 --> 00:09:51,126
I would have known you anywhere.

70
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:55,570
And I you, my dear sister.

71
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,332
Welcome home.

72
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:59,841
Welcome to Scotland, Mary.

73
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:02,708
Thank you, James.

74
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,610
Frankly, I was worried.

75
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:08,183
- Thank heaven you crossed the sea safely.
- Oh, none too safely, James.

76
00:10:08,353 --> 00:10:09,877
We were pursued, nearly taken.

77
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:12,249
They did capture the ship
that carried our horses.

78
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,823
That's why I had to come
on that ridiculous horse.

79
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:17,325
A fine way to travel
for a triumphant homecoming.

80
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,258
Pursued at sea?

81
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:22,524
- By freebooters?
- A freebooter...

82
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,668
...with a skirt, I dare say.

83
00:10:26,604 --> 00:10:30,631
The lords of Scotland are waiting
to greet you. They're in the Great Hall.

84
00:10:30,808 --> 00:10:32,935
Will you...? Will you see them now?

85
00:10:33,111 --> 00:10:37,343
Oh, I'm a sight, and I did so want to look
my best after all these years.

86
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:46,580
Remember the old days
at Inchmahome, James?

87
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:49,921
I was a spoiled little girl,
and you seemed such a man.

88
00:10:50,094 --> 00:10:53,495
You'll never know how I admired
and looked up to you in those days.

89
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,526
You haven't changed at all, James.

90
00:11:26,931 --> 00:11:30,332
I wish to thank you for the welcome
you have given me, milords.

91
00:11:30,535 --> 00:11:33,003
I have been 13 years away.

92
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:35,867
It was not of my own choice
that I went away...

93
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,441
...but it is of my own choice
that I have returned.

94
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:43,479
You will find me young,
perhaps, inexperienced...

95
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:46,640
...but with the support of all of you...

96
00:11:46,818 --> 00:11:52,779
...and with the Earl of Moray at my side,
I shall rule fairly and justly.

97
00:12:10,942 --> 00:12:12,671
We thank Your Gracious Majesty.

98
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:19,008
The name of Stuart, of your father,
is loved and honored in Scotland...

99
00:12:19,183 --> 00:12:21,151
One moment, Lexington.

100
00:12:21,719 --> 00:12:26,452
Can't we welcome Her Majesty
without the presence of foreigners?

101
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:30,457
No, David.

102
00:12:31,729 --> 00:12:34,289
Rizzio is my secretary.

103
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:36,394
He will remain.

104
00:12:37,335 --> 00:12:39,030
Continue, Lexington.

105
00:12:39,203 --> 00:12:42,172
No affront is intended, Your Majesty.

106
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,274
I understand.

107
00:12:45,109 --> 00:12:48,567
On behalf of these lords and nobles
of your kingdom...

108
00:12:48,746 --> 00:12:53,206
...I wish to assure you
of our unwavering loyalty.

109
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:57,753
Differences we may have, aye...

110
00:12:57,922 --> 00:13:00,049
...but they shall not divide us.

111
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:04,156
Differences?

112
00:13:04,329 --> 00:13:05,796
What differences?

113
00:13:06,831 --> 00:13:10,631
Nothing that cannot be resolved,
Your Majesty.

114
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,929
What differences, milords?

115
00:13:13,104 --> 00:13:16,164
Lexington meant nothing
of any importance, my dear sister.

116
00:13:16,341 --> 00:13:18,935
Exactly what did he mean, James?

117
00:13:20,378 --> 00:13:24,815
He was mindful of your religion.

118
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:30,516
You call that "nothing of importance"?

119
00:13:30,688 --> 00:13:32,952
It's your religion, too, James.

120
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:35,693
Please try to understand...

121
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,091
...conditions are changing.
The old faith is passing.

122
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,254
This is John Knox's day in Scotland.

123
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:44,959
And you've gone over to his side?

124
00:13:45,136 --> 00:13:46,933
I've only followed my conscience.

125
00:13:47,105 --> 00:13:49,164
I hope you have one, James.

126
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,399
I had your own interest at stake.

127
00:13:51,576 --> 00:13:54,670
I was regent.
It was my duty to protect your throne.

128
00:13:54,846 --> 00:13:58,976
- By attacking what I hold most dear?
- By making friends with Knox.

129
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,675
Do you realize the power he holds
over the people?

130
00:14:01,853 --> 00:14:04,686
If you want the people behind you,
do as Moray has done.

131
00:14:04,856 --> 00:14:07,381
Aye, there's Elizabeth.

132
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,493
Where is Elizabeth?

133
00:14:10,661 --> 00:14:13,152
Born in the old faith like yourself,
milady.

134
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:15,662
But she gets off a ship when it sinks.

135
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,801
I don't like your tone, Ruthven.

136
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:21,461
My religion is no garment to be
put on and off with the weather.

137
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:25,075
You had better know that, all of you!
I shall worship as I please...

138
00:14:25,243 --> 00:14:28,701
...and hope for all men to worship
as they please in Scotland.

139
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,178
Good for you, lassie!

140
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:32,748
You're from the north, Huntly.

141
00:14:32,917 --> 00:14:35,613
- Are you a turncoat?
- No, no.

142
00:14:35,787 --> 00:14:39,621
And I'll defend to the death
your right to worship as you wish.

143
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,186
Thank you, Huntly.

144
00:14:45,263 --> 00:14:47,823
And now, let that be an end...

145
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:51,093
...of this unimportant matter.

146
00:14:51,803 --> 00:14:55,739
Is there anything else on your minds,
milords?

147
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,469
- We're to speak about your marriage.
- Ruthven!

148
00:14:58,643 --> 00:14:59,735
Aye!

149
00:14:59,911 --> 00:15:01,401
Go on, Lexington!

150
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:04,912
We have hesitated to mention this,
Your Majesty...

151
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:09,678
...but now, you have returned.
- Why mince words, Lexington?

152
00:15:11,355 --> 00:15:14,882
The King of France died when I was 18.

153
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:18,256
Naturally, I'm free to marry again...

154
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:19,691
...if I choose to.

155
00:15:19,864 --> 00:15:23,095
We realize the matter is delicate,
Your Majesty.

156
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,632
I'm glad you realize that.

157
00:15:24,802 --> 00:15:28,602
But the matter is of the gravest importance.
These are troubled times.

158
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:31,970
If you made a foreign alliance,
what would happen here?

159
00:15:32,143 --> 00:15:34,737
Until you are safely married
to a loyal Scot...

160
00:15:34,912 --> 00:15:38,473
...whom we can trust,
Scotland will be unsettled.

161
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:42,642
All we wish is to see you safe
on your throne.

162
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:46,187
It's true, my dear sister. Until men
know what alliance you will make...

163
00:15:46,357 --> 00:15:49,326
...the clans will sleep with their swords
in their hands.

164
00:15:49,494 --> 00:15:52,520
- I suppose you've decided on my husband?
- Aye.

165
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:56,189
- One of you?
- No, we wouldn't stand for that.

166
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,631
We've considered only your welfare
in choosing.

167
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:01,897
- Choosing whom?
- Lord Darnley.

168
00:16:02,073 --> 00:16:05,804
He is a Stuart, next heir after yourself
to the throne of England.

169
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:09,435
You yourself said that you would never
give up your claim to the succession.

170
00:16:09,614 --> 00:16:12,276
Marry Darnley and strengthen it.

171
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:15,310
Of course...

172
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:19,820
...I can't give myself out
to be a virgin queen...

173
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,516
...like our cousin, Elizabeth.

174
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:27,458
But suppose I don't choose
to marry at all.

175
00:16:27,632 --> 00:16:31,432
Then you'll do as you please,
and I'm behind you, lassie.

176
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:33,160
Thank you, Huntly.

177
00:16:33,337 --> 00:16:35,771
I see I have one friend here.

178
00:16:38,042 --> 00:16:40,442
Where is the other Bothwell? Is he here?

179
00:16:42,213 --> 00:16:45,011
- Why do you laugh, Morton?
- No offense, dear Majesty...

180
00:16:45,182 --> 00:16:46,774
It concerns the Earl of Bothwell?

181
00:16:46,951 --> 00:16:50,887
Something he said
about Your Majesty, yes.

182
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,687
And what did he say?

183
00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,159
Bothwell said, "You and Elizabeth rolled
together wouldn't make an honest woman. "

184
00:17:04,235 --> 00:17:08,638
And do milords allow my name
to be slandered?

185
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:10,933
Aye, Your Majesty, you're mistaken.

186
00:17:11,108 --> 00:17:13,702
There's no love lost
between us and Bothwell.

187
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:17,211
- Take no account of such speech.
- I shall take account of it.

188
00:17:17,381 --> 00:17:19,611
I shall take account
of all the veiled insults...

189
00:17:19,784 --> 00:17:22,719
...which have been flung at me tonight
under the guise of welcome.

190
00:17:22,887 --> 00:17:25,321
- Lassie...
- I realize now what kind of support...

191
00:17:25,489 --> 00:17:29,152
...I may expect from all of you,
even from my own half-brother.

192
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:31,522
- My dear sister...
- I know where you stand now.

193
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:33,186
I know where I stand.

194
00:17:33,364 --> 00:17:36,333
Go ahead, form your council,
do as you wish.

195
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,627
I'll have no hand in it.

196
00:17:38,803 --> 00:17:41,897
Up until now, I have never done
anything of my own wish.

197
00:17:42,073 --> 00:17:45,736
The ambition of other men carried me
to France when I was a child.

198
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,971
The ambition of other men married me
to a dying boy who became King of France.

199
00:17:50,147 --> 00:17:53,514
I wasn't asked. But I am through.

200
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:56,915
I'm going to live my own life,
do as I say.

201
00:17:57,088 --> 00:17:59,022
I refuse to marry.

202
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,351
I love no one,
and I shall marry no one.

203
00:18:01,525 --> 00:18:03,755
I'm going to begin to be myself...

204
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:05,896
...Mary Stuart.

205
00:18:47,004 --> 00:18:49,768
She sits on that throne
only so long as we maintain her there.

206
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,670
- Softly. Softly.
- Why? Do you curry favor with her?

207
00:18:52,843 --> 00:18:55,710
She'll find out we'll stand
for only so much!

208
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,180
She'll sit on the throne
only as long as we keep her there!

209
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:04,481
She is our queen,
and she'll remain our queen!

210
00:19:04,655 --> 00:19:07,089
- I'll back you in that, Huntly.
- I'll go with you.

211
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:09,089
Softly. Softly.

212
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,627
There'll be no throne nor Scotland,
if we fall out.

213
00:19:12,797 --> 00:19:16,858
- Who's going to keep her in hand?
- I will. She'll accept the council I propose.

214
00:19:17,034 --> 00:19:20,094
Have you already picked yourself
to be prime minister, Moray?

215
00:19:20,271 --> 00:19:23,866
Aye. And with Lexington the secretary
of state, what have you to fear?

216
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:26,475
I'll serve her faithfully, Moray,
I promise you that.

217
00:19:26,644 --> 00:19:29,545
Aye, as long as it serves
your own purposes.

218
00:19:29,714 --> 00:19:32,478
But who's to look after the rest of us?

219
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,447
I will.

220
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:36,779
I promise you.

221
00:19:40,825 --> 00:19:42,816
Madonna.

222
00:19:50,801 --> 00:19:55,397
<i>We hail from the burnside
The hills and the glen</i>

223
00:19:55,573 --> 00:20:00,169
<i>When the pipes O' the queen
Sound the call</i>

224
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:05,213
<i>And glad are the hearts
O' her loyal highland men</i>

225
00:20:05,382 --> 00:20:10,149
<i>Whether victory or death may befall</i>

226
00:20:10,321 --> 00:20:14,621
<i>Tho' the road be long and drear
When the pibroch's ringing clear</i>

227
00:20:14,792 --> 00:20:19,354
<i>With the skirl of Stuarts off to war</i>

228
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:24,194
<i>We will fight for our queen
She's the fairest ever seen</i>

229
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:28,895
<i>So the Scots may be free as of yore</i>

230
00:20:29,106 --> 00:20:33,600
<i>For chains shall not bind us
No English yokes shall drop</i>

231
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:38,374
<i>Let us free Scotland forevermore</i>

232
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:46,981
And a while ago, I...

233
00:20:47,158 --> 00:20:50,286
I wanted to run away,
it all seemed so hateful.

234
00:20:51,395 --> 00:20:53,158
But now...

235
00:20:54,632 --> 00:20:56,896
...I'll find a way to win.

236
00:20:57,434 --> 00:21:02,394
<i>Tho' the road be long and drear
When the pibroch's ringing clear</i>

237
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:06,976
<i>With the skirl of Stuarts off to war</i>

238
00:21:09,747 --> 00:21:14,047
<i>Scotia land, fresh and fair</i>

239
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:18,450
<i>Pine and heather fill the air</i>

240
00:21:18,622 --> 00:21:20,920
<i>Bonnie land</i>

241
00:21:21,091 --> 00:21:25,687
<i>That our forefathers bore</i>

242
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:32,168
<i>Our queen, we'll defend</i>

243
00:21:32,336 --> 00:21:36,773
<i>Stuart's cause will never end</i>

244
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:41,602
<i>Till we free Scotland</i>

245
00:21:41,779 --> 00:21:46,773
<i>Forevermore</i>

246
00:21:48,018 --> 00:21:52,921
<i>We will fight for our queen
She's the fairest ever seen</i>

247
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,424
<i>So the Scots may be free as of yore</i>

248
00:21:57,695 --> 00:22:04,066
<i>For chains shall not bind us
No English yokes shall drop</i>

249
00:22:06,704 --> 00:22:08,729
Singing, dancing, drinking...

250
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:11,898
...and all the vile
and evil uses of the flesh.

251
00:22:12,109 --> 00:22:18,048
They run before this jezebel of France
like a foul air!

252
00:22:18,215 --> 00:22:21,446
Aye, she's a Stuart on her father's side...

253
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:23,348
...but who was her mother?

254
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,852
Who was her mother?

255
00:22:26,023 --> 00:22:29,322
French Mary of Guise.

256
00:22:29,493 --> 00:22:35,227
She was regent when George Wishart
was burned alive for heresy.

257
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:37,264
And what was his heresy?

258
00:22:37,434 --> 00:22:40,369
Preaching the reformed religion...

259
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:46,203
...teaching me, John Knox,
the wisdom and the glory of God.

260
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:51,507
Aye, and the flames
that consumed my teacher...

261
00:22:51,682 --> 00:22:56,051
...ripped deep into this heart.

262
00:22:56,553 --> 00:22:58,418
Did Mary Stuart come to Scotia...

263
00:22:58,589 --> 00:23:02,821
...while she sat on the golden throne
of France? No! No!

264
00:23:02,993 --> 00:23:06,986
She was lost in luxury
and the sinful joys of the flesh.

265
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:08,756
And now, now...

266
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:12,733
...when fate has cast her down
from that throne of sin...

267
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:15,497
...she remembers another gem
in her crown...

268
00:23:15,673 --> 00:23:18,369
...the gem she was born with, Scotland!

269
00:23:18,542 --> 00:23:21,170
The time has come for all men...

270
00:23:21,345 --> 00:23:24,109
...to choose
between the kilt of Scotland...

271
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:26,010
...and this Jezebel of France!

272
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:28,117
Master Knox.

273
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:32,754
Aye.

274
00:23:32,923 --> 00:23:36,120
We Scots know who fought
for the mother.

275
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:39,922
Aye, and we Scots remember
who fought against her.

276
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,461
Mock me as you will.

277
00:23:41,632 --> 00:23:43,623
You can never silence me tongue.

278
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:46,801
I'm no such fool, Master Knox.

279
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:49,769
You can't silence 10,000 trumpets.

280
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,340
But I can match you with a better tune...

281
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,912
...and from a better bag of wind.
- I shall say what I have come to say.

282
00:23:57,114 --> 00:24:00,914
And neither rank nor station
shall avail mine enemies.

283
00:24:02,152 --> 00:24:03,915
Follow, my people!

284
00:24:04,088 --> 00:24:09,116
Have we not had enough of the Guises
and their followers? Aye!

285
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:12,295
Let them stick
to their warmer climates!

286
00:24:12,463 --> 00:24:15,023
And may they come
to a hundred plagues...

287
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:17,667
...before ever they should have
another standard here.

288
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:21,667
Back! Back, I say!

289
00:24:25,042 --> 00:24:28,239
Stop! Stop, I say!

290
00:24:28,445 --> 00:24:32,848
Stop, or I shall bring down the curse
of God upon you!

291
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:59,866
Stop, or I shall bring down the curse
of God upon you!

292
00:25:09,686 --> 00:25:11,347
Stop!

293
00:25:21,832 --> 00:25:25,962
Your Majesty, may I rid your presence
of this old goat?

294
00:25:26,637 --> 00:25:29,197
I wish to speak to this gentleman.

295
00:25:31,508 --> 00:25:33,840
Won't you come inside, Master Knox?

296
00:25:35,512 --> 00:25:37,503
Is there anything to fear?

297
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,294
Look at me, Master Knox.

298
00:25:52,463 --> 00:25:55,557
Can you believe in your heart
that I'm as wicked as you say?

299
00:25:55,732 --> 00:25:57,495
Do you not bring back the old faith...

300
00:25:57,668 --> 00:26:00,136
...that we've cast out of Scotland
as the work of Satan?

301
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:02,864
Is it a crime to be steadfast
in the faith of our fathers?

302
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:05,565
There is only one true faith,
and that I preach.

303
00:26:05,742 --> 00:26:09,439
Preach your faith, Master Knox. Preach it.
Let me practice mine.

304
00:26:09,613 --> 00:26:11,706
- Can I forget whose daughter...?
- It's true...

305
00:26:11,882 --> 00:26:13,816
...I'm the daughter of Mary of Guise.

306
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,316
It is true I keep my mother's religion.

307
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:21,117
Still, I'll respect your own and will give you
as much freedom as I'll demand for myself.

308
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:26,228
- Aye, they told me you spoke fairly.
- Can't you also? Can't you be tolerant?

309
00:26:26,597 --> 00:26:29,691
I want to be loved by my people.
I need their support.

310
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:31,334
Your support, your friendship.

311
00:26:31,502 --> 00:26:33,732
You heard my words out there
in the courtyard?

312
00:26:33,904 --> 00:26:36,737
I heard words that another sovereign
would call treason...

313
00:26:36,907 --> 00:26:40,001
...words another sovereign would punish
as my mother punished treason.

314
00:26:40,177 --> 00:26:42,611
I called ye "Jezebel of France"
out there...

315
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:45,441
...and I'll call it ye again.

316
00:26:45,616 --> 00:26:48,176
I believe in your sincerity, Master Knox.

317
00:26:49,386 --> 00:26:51,445
I only ask you to believe in mine.

318
00:26:52,022 --> 00:26:54,013
Can't we be friends?

319
00:26:54,191 --> 00:26:58,719
- I have said what I came to say.
- But you no longer mean it. You're...

320
00:27:00,464 --> 00:27:03,160
Well, blast his insolence.

321
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:06,628
The old ram, he ought to be hung.

322
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:13,908
- It will take more than love to rule this land.
- I haven't asked your opinion.

323
00:27:14,077 --> 00:27:15,510
Good.

324
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,513
Good, you've got a temper.
But don't curb it, Your Majesty.

325
00:27:19,683 --> 00:27:22,914
- Force your crown and fear your scepter.
- You the captain of the guard?

326
00:27:23,086 --> 00:27:24,451
No, I only arrived tonight.

327
00:27:24,621 --> 00:27:28,352
Then you'll leave again and not return
until you've learned to hold your tongue.

328
00:27:28,525 --> 00:27:30,789
I'm afraid that will be never,
Your Majesty.

329
00:27:31,228 --> 00:27:35,130
I see I've arrived too late.
Moray has already told you about me.

330
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:38,132
About you? You pride yourself.

331
00:27:38,302 --> 00:27:39,633
Aye.

332
00:27:39,803 --> 00:27:41,668
It's a way I have, Mary Stuart.

333
00:27:41,838 --> 00:27:45,706
- And who are you?
- You heard my pipers.

334
00:27:45,876 --> 00:27:48,242
- You don't remember my clan?
- Which clan?

335
00:27:48,412 --> 00:27:51,779
When you hear those pipes,
you know the Bothwells are about.

336
00:27:51,949 --> 00:27:56,682
- So you are the Earl of Bothwell.
- At Your Majesty's service.

337
00:27:57,854 --> 00:28:03,349
Did you say that Elizabeth Tudor and I rolled
together wouldn't make an honest woman?

338
00:28:03,527 --> 00:28:05,927
Oh, no, not at all.

339
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:09,862
What I really said was that the two of you
together wouldn't make a proper woman.

340
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,831
But that was years ago
when I saw you in France.

341
00:28:13,036 --> 00:28:15,197
Just a skinny little girl.

342
00:28:16,273 --> 00:28:18,138
I wouldn't say it now.

343
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:25,845
You're a very outspoken man,
Milord Bothwell.

344
00:28:26,016 --> 00:28:28,484
That's one privilege I've always retained.

345
00:28:28,652 --> 00:28:33,282
Oh, come now, you don't want flattery.
I've confessed. Forgive me.

346
00:28:34,024 --> 00:28:37,516
Well, you did fight in defense of my mother.
I thank you for that.

347
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:40,322
Don't thank me. It was a pleasure.

348
00:28:42,132 --> 00:28:44,430
I have found many enemies here.

349
00:28:45,636 --> 00:28:48,070
Have I also found a friend?

350
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:53,301
You'll only find out who's your friend
in Scotland by putting him to the test.

351
00:28:55,112 --> 00:28:57,706
Tonight, I need loyal backing
more than my mother did.

352
00:28:57,881 --> 00:29:01,078
So I imagine. And hearing Moray
and the lords were here...

353
00:29:01,251 --> 00:29:04,311
...to welcome you,
I rode over from the border.

354
00:29:04,488 --> 00:29:07,321
To stand with them against me?

355
00:29:08,325 --> 00:29:09,622
Where are they?

356
00:29:10,994 --> 00:29:13,428
They are forming my council...

357
00:29:13,897 --> 00:29:15,762
...in the hall.

358
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,057
- Bothwell, where have you been?
- Down to the border, Morton...

359
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,221
...hanging a few of your clansmen.

360
00:29:50,867 --> 00:29:52,562
Well, milords...

361
00:29:52,736 --> 00:29:54,397
...have you divided the spoils?

362
00:29:54,604 --> 00:29:56,697
We're forming Her Majesty's council.

363
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:59,398
You, Moray, as prime minister, I fancy.

364
00:29:59,576 --> 00:30:03,603
- Naturally.
- You, Morton, as secretary of state.

365
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:07,275
- Or is it Ruthven?
- No, Lexington.

366
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:11,251
- Aye, Lexington.
- Indeed.

367
00:30:11,421 --> 00:30:13,651
Who is to be the queen's
lieutenant general?

368
00:30:13,824 --> 00:30:15,291
That's for me!

369
00:30:16,326 --> 00:30:18,954
You're all wrong, gentlemen.

370
00:30:19,129 --> 00:30:23,498
I've decided to take charge
of Her Majesty's armed forces myself.

371
00:30:23,667 --> 00:30:26,397
- We'll not allow it, Bothwell!
- You're too late.

372
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:30,199
- I've just accepted the appointment.
- From whom?

373
00:30:30,974 --> 00:30:33,374
From Her Majesty, the queen.

374
00:30:47,758 --> 00:30:51,785
Didn't you say that Randolph was expected
to return from Scotland this morning?

375
00:30:51,962 --> 00:30:53,190
I did, Your Majesty.

376
00:30:58,335 --> 00:31:01,031
I wonder what's keeping him.

377
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:03,934
Some pretty face, I dare say.

378
00:31:05,842 --> 00:31:08,675
Are you growing jealous
of Randolph, Leicester?

379
00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:11,313
Is it any fault of mine, Your Majesty?

380
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:15,110
More and more now, you're giving your
important commissions to Lord Randolph.

381
00:31:15,285 --> 00:31:19,085
- There was a time when I basked...
- Don't say "bask. "

382
00:31:19,256 --> 00:31:21,486
It reminds me of a fish.

383
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:24,560
Your Majesty, you know my feelings.

384
00:31:24,728 --> 00:31:29,688
You must realize how they're torn
when you avert your gaze.

385
00:31:29,866 --> 00:31:31,561
Your Majesty...

386
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:34,067
...I beg you on my knees.

387
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:38,401
Milord Randolph,
ambassador to Scotland.

388
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,680
Get up!

389
00:31:54,858 --> 00:31:58,885
Did you convey my friendly greetings
to Mary Stuart...

390
00:31:59,062 --> 00:32:02,293
...tell her how I rejoiced
at her safe return from France?

391
00:32:02,466 --> 00:32:04,627
Most ardently, Your Majesty.

392
00:32:04,801 --> 00:32:06,393
Ardently.

393
00:32:07,237 --> 00:32:09,797
I begin to understand your dallying.

394
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,635
I've heard of her enchantment.

395
00:32:13,777 --> 00:32:15,176
Tell me...

396
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:18,307
...is she as pretty as they say?

397
00:32:24,554 --> 00:32:26,886
You may see for yourself.

398
00:32:27,324 --> 00:32:30,953
She sent you this token of her love.

399
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,150
A girl.

400
00:32:55,719 --> 00:32:57,277
Not a queen.

401
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,921
Tell me...

402
00:33:03,727 --> 00:33:07,356
...what's she like?
- Most charming, Your Majesty.

403
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:10,193
Already, she has many suitors...

404
00:33:10,367 --> 00:33:13,632
...chief among them is Lord Darnley.
- Darnley?

405
00:33:14,604 --> 00:33:16,765
Another thorn in my crown.

406
00:33:16,973 --> 00:33:18,634
Weakling.

407
00:33:18,808 --> 00:33:20,537
Drunkard.

408
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:24,477
He stands next to my throne...

409
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:28,351
...under her.

410
00:33:28,752 --> 00:33:31,414
I'd be in double jeopardy
if she married him.

411
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:35,456
In my opinion, Your Majesty,
the Earl of Bothwell removes that danger.

412
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,286
He leads her troops like a hurricane.

413
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,952
He's restored more order in a month
in the north than it's known for 10 years.

414
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:43,656
He's her mainstay now.
It's plain, he's in love with her.

415
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:47,132
You think I could sleep with Bothwell
on the throne beside her?

416
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:50,239
But, Your Majesty,
she's a creature of love.

417
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:52,568
Believe me, your fears are unfounded.

418
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:56,610
- She wins men to her side in gentle ways.
- Aye...

419
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:01,740
...and I see she has won our Randolph,
among others. You shall go north no more!

420
00:34:01,918 --> 00:34:05,615
- Your Majesty...
- Throckmorton, you're a cold fish.

421
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:08,155
You shall be
my ambassador to Scotland.

422
00:34:08,325 --> 00:34:11,852
- But, Your Majesty, I'm simply giving you...
- Leave us! Leave us!

423
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:15,795
And take care...

424
00:34:15,999 --> 00:34:19,162
...or your heart will fall off your sleeve.

425
00:34:25,508 --> 00:34:26,839
Darnley.

426
00:34:27,577 --> 00:34:29,067
Bothwell...

427
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:33,379
Am I never to have peace?

428
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:36,747
- She must be defeated.
- How?

429
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:41,721
- Declare war. Unite Scotland with England.
- War...

430
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,752
...is that all you men know?

431
00:34:45,195 --> 00:34:48,164
Unite Scotland against England,
you mean.

432
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:52,861
Unite Scotland under Mary Stuart.

433
00:34:53,036 --> 00:34:55,402
But how else is she to be defeated?

434
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,545
You know what it is
to be born illegitimate?

435
00:35:09,319 --> 00:35:12,186
To have royal blood in your veins...

436
00:35:12,956 --> 00:35:17,017
...and that one word standing
between you and the throne?

437
00:35:18,561 --> 00:35:20,961
How it makes ambition burn?

438
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,893
Who was it ruled Scotland
before she returned?

439
00:35:27,537 --> 00:35:29,801
Who wants to rule again?

440
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:31,235
The Earl of Moray.

441
00:35:31,408 --> 00:35:35,538
You shall ride north tonight
as my ambassador, Throckmorton...

442
00:35:36,346 --> 00:35:38,644
...and get in touch with Moray.

443
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:54,993
So, Lord Bothwell has put down
the rebellion on the border.

444
00:35:55,632 --> 00:35:57,759
Has he returned yet?

445
00:35:57,934 --> 00:36:00,801
- Not yet, madam.
- Why that tone?

446
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:05,003
I no longer have your confidence.

447
00:36:05,508 --> 00:36:07,100
That's not true.

448
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:11,338
You know you must secure your throne
by marrying, yet every time I mention it...

449
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,506
- You don't like Bothwell?
- He has been a good lieutenant general.

450
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:16,845
- His religion rules him out?
- He has no religion.

451
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,511
- All he believes in is this.
- I should be thankful.

452
00:36:19,689 --> 00:36:23,125
It's done more for me than your music
and your continual talk about marriage.

453
00:36:23,293 --> 00:36:27,229
- I'm sorry, David.
- I try only to serve you faithfully.

454
00:36:27,564 --> 00:36:31,056
Yes. You're as fanatical
in your way as John Knox is.

455
00:36:31,234 --> 00:36:34,795
I often wonder which you love the most,
myself or my religion.

456
00:36:34,971 --> 00:36:36,461
I would never betray either.

457
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,031
You imply that I would?

458
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,373
You are the sole defender
of our faith on these isles.

459
00:36:43,546 --> 00:36:46,174
What becomes of that
if you marry a heretic?

460
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:47,577
Meaning Bothwell?

461
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:51,551
Even Lord Darnley
is 100 times a better choice.

462
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,087
At least, he's of the faith.

463
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,058
Why must I marry at all?

464
00:36:57,227 --> 00:37:00,754
To have an heir,
to be true to your blood...

465
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,058
...to escape the tyranny of these lords
who laugh in your face.

466
00:37:05,168 --> 00:37:08,831
You're a worse tyrant in your loyalty
than they are in their disloyalty, David.

467
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:12,971
I have never urged
Your Majesty to marry a Scot.

468
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:15,668
Marry in Europe, where your destiny is.

469
00:37:15,845 --> 00:37:19,303
My destiny is here in Scotland.

470
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:22,944
Whom would you have me marry, David?
Tell me.

471
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:29,388
Look at these marriage proposals.
First and foremost, Don Carlos of Spain.

472
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:30,992
Onions.

473
00:37:32,028 --> 00:37:35,520
The archduke of Austria is not so good
a match, but he is eager to marry you.

474
00:37:35,698 --> 00:37:38,496
- No, no. Beer, not women.
- The king of Sweden?

475
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:40,135
But his ears...

476
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:42,931
- Don't forget the king of Denmark.
- Forget him? Lmpossible.

477
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:45,301
But would Scotland ever be quiet
if I married him?

478
00:37:45,475 --> 00:37:49,377
- I assure you, he's a very peaceable man.
- But they say he snores.

479
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:51,104
The duke of Anjou.

480
00:37:51,281 --> 00:37:52,646
The prince de Condé.

481
00:37:52,816 --> 00:37:54,181
The duke of Ferrara.

482
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:56,375
The duke d'Orléans.

483
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:10,929
Oh, no! Oh, David. David.

484
00:38:11,134 --> 00:38:12,897
David.

485
00:38:14,604 --> 00:38:16,799
I'm sorry.

486
00:38:17,273 --> 00:38:19,639
I didn't mean to make fun of you.

487
00:38:21,344 --> 00:38:25,303
I know you're right.
I can't put it off any longer.

488
00:38:25,481 --> 00:38:29,781
- But I vow I'll not marry in Europe.
- Marry Lord Darnley then.

489
00:38:29,953 --> 00:38:32,217
There is no one else.

490
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:35,255
Marry him, madam. I beg you.

491
00:38:38,294 --> 00:38:39,852
Very well, David.

492
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:44,998
You're not serious.

493
00:38:46,736 --> 00:38:48,567
Oh, yes, I am.

494
00:38:50,773 --> 00:38:53,435
Now it's over.

495
00:38:55,311 --> 00:38:56,903
Finished.

496
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,840
I knew it had to be, really.

497
00:39:00,016 --> 00:39:01,540
Go, summon Darnley.

498
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:03,413
I'll tell him at once.

499
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:06,548
No.

500
00:39:06,723 --> 00:39:08,384
No, David.

501
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,650
Lord Darnley.

502
00:40:28,037 --> 00:40:30,301
The four pretty wenches.

503
00:40:30,473 --> 00:40:31,963
Five, milord...

504
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:34,075
...now that you're here.

505
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:37,545
I say, you call me pretty?

506
00:40:37,981 --> 00:40:40,313
Well, as I always say, my dears...

507
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:44,078
...the fairest flower in Scotland
grows on the highest bough.

508
00:40:44,253 --> 00:40:45,982
Milord.

509
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,919
I've been waiting all day.
Am I never to see Her Majesty?

510
00:40:49,092 --> 00:40:51,720
You'll see her when she wants
to see you, milord.

511
00:40:52,462 --> 00:40:54,726
The four protective angels.

512
00:40:54,897 --> 00:40:56,626
Hello, Darnley.

513
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:59,359
Still hanging around, eh?
Where's Her Majesty?

514
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:01,628
In her study,
with the English ambassador.

515
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:05,171
And strict orders not to be disturbed.

516
00:41:05,341 --> 00:41:11,143
Don't shake your finger at me, snub-nose.
I'll spank you where you belong.

517
00:41:17,186 --> 00:41:19,677
I'm left out in the cold, too, Bothwell...

518
00:41:19,856 --> 00:41:23,121
...and these lassies have no time
for plain Scotsmen.

519
00:41:23,326 --> 00:41:26,818
- How long am I to be kept waiting?
- Oh, listen to the man.

520
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:28,588
You'd think he owned the place.

521
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:32,462
If I did, there'd be no Lord Throckmorton
around, I can tell you that.

522
00:41:32,635 --> 00:41:34,535
Oh, I forgot, Darnley...

523
00:41:34,704 --> 00:41:36,865
...he's a friend of yours.

524
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,440
I hear he's promised to back
your claim to England...

525
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:41,668
...if you take yourself out of Scotland.

526
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:44,307
Jealous, Bothwell?

527
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,416
On the contrary.
I think it's a first-rate idea.

528
00:41:50,887 --> 00:41:52,980
I shall wait for Her Majesty below.

529
00:41:54,724 --> 00:41:59,218
- Don't go on my account.
- I'm not going on your account, sir.

530
00:42:02,698 --> 00:42:04,825
I suppose you laugh at me, too,
behind my back.

531
00:42:05,001 --> 00:42:07,936
Oh, no, it's not safe to laugh
at a barbarian.

532
00:42:08,104 --> 00:42:10,163
For two farthings,
I'd put you over my knee.

533
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:11,499
Oh, milord.

534
00:42:11,674 --> 00:42:14,905
- Go tell Her Majesty I want to see her.
- What to do with a man like that?

535
00:42:15,078 --> 00:42:16,705
He won't take no for an answer.

536
00:42:16,879 --> 00:42:19,848
Someday you'll meet a man
who won't take no for an answer.

537
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:21,313
And?

538
00:42:21,818 --> 00:42:23,183
And I'll be the godfather.

539
00:42:24,787 --> 00:42:27,312
- Now will you tell the queen?
- No, I won't.

540
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,355
Then here I stay.

541
00:42:35,064 --> 00:42:38,795
For one hour, Lord Throckmorton,
you've been talking in circles.

542
00:42:38,968 --> 00:42:41,266
I still don't know what it is
Elizabeth wants.

543
00:42:41,437 --> 00:42:45,032
- Do I fail to speak fluently?
- Too fluently. You conceal your purpose.

544
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:46,800
Your Majesty...

545
00:42:47,376 --> 00:42:49,970
You tell me again and again
of Elizabeth's friendship.

546
00:42:50,146 --> 00:42:54,742
I, too, give her my friendship.
We're two rulers in two adjoining countries.

547
00:42:54,917 --> 00:42:56,976
We're related by blood ties.

548
00:42:57,153 --> 00:43:00,281
There's every reason for friendship
based on understanding.

549
00:43:00,456 --> 00:43:04,085
But how can there be understanding
without frankness?

550
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,855
- Be frank. What is it Elizabeth wants?
- Very well.

551
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:09,361
Marry the man she chooses...

552
00:43:09,532 --> 00:43:13,059
...and she'll recognize you
as the next heir to the throne of England.

553
00:43:13,236 --> 00:43:18,503
My succession was ordained
by circumstances out of her control.

554
00:43:19,442 --> 00:43:21,740
I don't need her acknowledgement.

555
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:25,438
My mistress only meant that
if you marry the man of her choosing...

556
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:27,606
...it would indicate no threat
to her throne.

557
00:43:27,783 --> 00:43:30,877
- She has someone in mind, I suppose.
- She...

558
00:43:31,053 --> 00:43:34,113
- She did mention a name, Your Majesty.
- Who?

559
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:35,814
The Earl of Leicester.

560
00:43:36,759 --> 00:43:38,522
She named him?

561
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:43,088
She had the temerity to name
the Earl of Leicester?

562
00:43:43,266 --> 00:43:45,894
No one stands higher in her esteem
than Leicester.

563
00:43:46,369 --> 00:43:49,634
Why, she's shown that.
She's flaunted him before all England.

564
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:52,074
Her favorite, her leavings...

565
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:54,334
...and now she wants
to cast him off on me...

566
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,444
...make me a laughingstock
before the world?

567
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:58,603
- Please...
- You told me what is in her mind.

568
00:43:58,781 --> 00:44:00,078
Let me tell you the rest.

569
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:04,151
My cousin Elizabeth has never taken
a single step that wasn't political.

570
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:08,222
She's afraid I will marry the one man
who embodies everything she fears...

571
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:11,758
...the man who is next heir after me
to her throne, Lord Darnley.

572
00:44:11,928 --> 00:44:13,555
That is sheer imagination.

573
00:44:13,729 --> 00:44:17,165
It is not in my nature to play politics,
but now I shall.

574
00:44:17,366 --> 00:44:21,962
There is no other course I can follow
and keep face with my faith...

575
00:44:22,138 --> 00:44:23,969
...and with the name I bear.

576
00:44:25,575 --> 00:44:27,668
Now I know what I shall do.

577
00:44:27,843 --> 00:44:30,835
Your Majesty,
I beg of you not to be rash.

578
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,282
Leave me. Go back to Elizabeth.

579
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:37,618
Tell her what I have said.

580
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,064
David...

581
00:44:56,772 --> 00:44:59,206
...go and find Lord Darnley.

582
00:45:15,858 --> 00:45:17,883
Have you seen Lord Darnley?

583
00:45:19,562 --> 00:45:23,293
- Why?
- Her Majesty wishes to see him.

584
00:45:23,699 --> 00:45:25,223
Privately.

585
00:45:36,045 --> 00:45:39,481
A room's a room, and a door's a door.
I've been waiting to see you for hours.

586
00:45:39,649 --> 00:45:41,947
Are you a man or a storm
not to be brought indoors?

587
00:45:42,118 --> 00:45:45,417
- When my girl won't see me, I'm a storm.
- Is that the way you speak of me?

588
00:45:45,588 --> 00:45:48,113
You expect me to bow and scrape
and make pretty speeches?

589
00:45:48,291 --> 00:45:51,158
- I'm a soldier. I love you.
- You wanna take everything by storm.

590
00:45:51,327 --> 00:45:53,818
- You know any better way?
- You forget I'm your queen.

591
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:57,523
Have I ever forgotten that? But I remember
you're a woman. Don't forget that.

592
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,793
- I won't be talked to that way.
- Yes, you will.

593
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:02,938
You're going to listen to me for once.
You know I love you.

594
00:46:03,105 --> 00:46:05,437
You've known it from
the first moment I met you.

595
00:46:05,608 --> 00:46:07,599
I command you to leave me.

596
00:46:08,077 --> 00:46:10,944
What's come over you, Mary?
What's happened? You're frightened.

597
00:46:11,113 --> 00:46:14,105
- You say you're a queen, be one.
- What else am I trying to do?

598
00:46:14,283 --> 00:46:15,682
Leave me, please.

599
00:46:15,851 --> 00:46:18,649
- While you go marry someone else?
- Yes.

600
00:46:18,821 --> 00:46:22,086
- Now, I'm in no mood for joking.
- I'm going to marry Lord Darnley.

601
00:46:22,258 --> 00:46:25,193
- You're what?
- Marry Lord Darnley.

602
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:28,655
- You're out of your mind.
- Let me go.

603
00:46:28,831 --> 00:46:30,492
- No. No, you can't do it.
- Let me go.

604
00:46:30,666 --> 00:46:33,260
- I'll never let you go! I love you.
- You have no right.

605
00:46:33,436 --> 00:46:35,666
I have a right.
Let's not pretend you don't care.

606
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:37,965
I know days when you did,
when you told me so.

607
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,541
Aye, with your eyes, with everything
you did. You can't lie to me, Mary.

608
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:43,906
I made up my mind.
I'm gonna marry Darnley.

609
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:45,570
Darnley.

610
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:48,749
Why didn't you pick a man?

611
00:46:50,653 --> 00:46:53,486
Tell me that you love him, Mary,
and I'll let you go.

612
00:46:53,656 --> 00:46:55,590
Aye, you can't do it.

613
00:46:56,559 --> 00:46:58,424
I can.

614
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:00,323
I do.

615
00:47:02,131 --> 00:47:05,032
Will you learn this isn't
your kingdom, but mine?

616
00:47:05,201 --> 00:47:08,602
- Yours for how long?
- You think I can't rule without you?

617
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:10,170
Try it.

618
00:47:10,339 --> 00:47:13,399
- You can't leave Scotland.
- You've seen the last of me, Mary.

619
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:17,171
- I won't let you leave.
- I don't need your leave nor leave-taking.

620
00:47:17,346 --> 00:47:19,280
I'm just going.

621
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:40,299
Lord Darnley, Your Majesty.

622
00:47:56,152 --> 00:47:58,086
Lord Darnley...

623
00:47:59,488 --> 00:48:03,390
...you have asked my hand in marriage.

624
00:48:04,727 --> 00:48:06,354
I have decided to grant it.

625
00:48:06,529 --> 00:48:07,928
Your Majesty!

626
00:48:08,097 --> 00:48:09,621
Oh, I've hardly hoped...

627
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:11,926
I haven't dared...

628
00:48:12,535 --> 00:48:15,629
I'll love you, keep you, defend you.

629
00:48:15,805 --> 00:48:18,638
We shall face troubled times.

630
00:48:18,808 --> 00:48:21,504
This is some dream, a jest.

631
00:48:21,677 --> 00:48:23,076
It can't be true.

632
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:24,940
And yet...

633
00:48:25,981 --> 00:48:27,676
...it is true.

634
00:48:31,454 --> 00:48:33,479
I never dreamed...

635
00:48:33,789 --> 00:48:36,383
...I'm to hold you in my arms.

636
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:41,122
They say a kiss seals the bargain.

637
00:49:16,365 --> 00:49:19,960
James, they're waiting for you to say it.

638
00:49:26,008 --> 00:49:27,942
The fact is, my dear sister...

639
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:31,341
...we're troubled by your apparent
lack of confidence in this council.

640
00:49:32,014 --> 00:49:33,447
"Apparent"?

641
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:36,813
Why not say "obvious," and be frank?

642
00:49:37,286 --> 00:49:41,620
It's our rightful duty to shape your policies
and for you to accept them.

643
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:46,523
Instead of which, you constantly take
the advice of your secretary, Rizzio.

644
00:49:46,695 --> 00:49:48,560
I begin to see.

645
00:49:49,798 --> 00:49:51,493
You want me to get rid of David.

646
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,158
Aye, send him back where he belongs.

647
00:49:57,206 --> 00:49:58,798
Well, I shan't.

648
00:49:59,241 --> 00:50:01,004
You'd better think twice about that.

649
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:04,946
Are you giving me orders?

650
00:50:05,114 --> 00:50:07,548
No, no. Ruthven only meant to say...

651
00:50:07,716 --> 00:50:09,581
I know what Ruthven means to say.

652
00:50:09,752 --> 00:50:11,743
He means to say that I'm a fool...

653
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:14,754
...though he never dares
put it quite that boldly.

654
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,589
Well, I have been a fool.

655
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:22,119
I lost Bothwell, who held you all in check.

656
00:50:23,832 --> 00:50:28,269
I thought I was ruling Scotland,
but it was only his strength behind me.

657
00:50:28,837 --> 00:50:31,101
But I still have David.

658
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,800
You can't take Scotland for yourselves
so long as he is by my side.

659
00:50:35,978 --> 00:50:39,744
- I shall never let him go.
- He may be sorry if you don't.

660
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:42,179
Someday, Ruthven,
you may be sorry for that tongue.

661
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:45,479
In spite of my mistakes,
I've won my people to me.

662
00:50:45,654 --> 00:50:48,179
You all know it and fear it.

663
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:01,364
Sit down, milords. Sit down.
It's only your king.

664
00:51:15,618 --> 00:51:18,610
Always holding council, eh, Moray?

665
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,914
Always talking, talking.

666
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,787
- You're late.
- I don't take orders anymore.

667
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,451
I'm king now.

668
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:34,803
Even if someone doesn't seem to know it.

669
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:41,075
You never can count on a woman.

670
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:44,679
Marry one, and she turns to ice.

671
00:51:46,782 --> 00:51:49,250
They're all alike, even a queen.

672
00:51:51,453 --> 00:51:54,388
Can't stand the sight of you.

673
00:51:54,823 --> 00:51:57,883
Say you're drunk
when you need a kiss or two.

674
00:52:01,330 --> 00:52:04,060
Would you believe it, Moray?

675
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,496
They lock doors at night.

676
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:13,332
And all the while,
they're thinking of someone else...

677
00:52:13,809 --> 00:52:17,245
...some fellow who's gone to France,
perhaps!

678
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,539
Mary!

679
00:52:55,350 --> 00:52:57,580
Where's the queen? Open that door!

680
00:52:57,753 --> 00:52:59,482
Open that door!

681
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,773
Well, Moray?

682
00:53:46,301 --> 00:53:48,565
Will Your Majesty sign these papers now?

683
00:53:48,737 --> 00:53:51,729
- Where's my wife?
- Alone with her ladies, sire.

684
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:54,535
But you have access to her, eh, Rizzio?

685
00:53:54,710 --> 00:53:57,406
Will you sign these papers now,
Your Majesty?

686
00:53:57,579 --> 00:53:59,672
Later. Later!

687
00:54:12,327 --> 00:54:13,954
Now you know.

688
00:54:14,129 --> 00:54:15,687
- Lf I thought...
- If, if, if!

689
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:17,354
Open your eyes, man.

690
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:21,902
- Who else is with her all the time?
- Day and night, alone.

691
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:25,733
Regain her favor.
Be king in fact as well as name.

692
00:54:25,908 --> 00:54:28,399
Show her you don't lack courage.

693
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:30,442
Who said I lack courage?!

694
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,807
How dare you address me...

695
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:50,002
Eight to the clock, and all's well!

696
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:55,668
The queen's guards.

697
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:58,840
All's well.

698
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:06,220
<i>My life is in the north</i>

699
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:11,919
<i>And my heart is in the south</i>

700
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:19,733
<i>False I've pledged with my hand</i>

701
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:25,170
<i>False I've kissed with my mouth</i>

702
00:55:26,143 --> 00:55:31,479
<i>With hand caught to hand</i>

703
00:55:31,648 --> 00:55:37,780
<i>And the rain driving blind</i>

704
00:55:37,955 --> 00:55:44,451
<i>As the new years have driven</i>

705
00:55:44,828 --> 00:55:51,165
<i>Old loves out of mind</i>

706
00:55:52,503 --> 00:55:58,965
<i>As the new years have driven</i>

707
00:55:59,409 --> 00:56:06,440
<i>Old loves out of mind</i>

708
00:56:13,023 --> 00:56:14,991
What is that song, David?

709
00:56:17,895 --> 00:56:20,363
It's a song I made up.

710
00:56:20,564 --> 00:56:23,931
He's always making up
some nonsense about love.

711
00:56:24,101 --> 00:56:26,126
Aren't you in love, Beaton?

712
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:28,636
Just a soldier.

713
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:30,363
Not a penny to his name.

714
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:32,600
Why don't you marry him?

715
00:56:33,177 --> 00:56:36,044
- And live on air?
- On anything.

716
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:44,051
What do you see in the fire, David?

717
00:56:45,155 --> 00:56:46,952
The sunshine of Italy?

718
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:50,718
You want to go home, don't you?

719
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,029
You're my only friend,
and they're driving you away.

720
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,928
I want you to go, David...

721
00:57:02,105 --> 00:57:04,335
...for your own sake.

722
00:57:05,409 --> 00:57:07,570
Though I don't know what
we'll do without you.

723
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:11,544
Milady...

724
00:57:11,715 --> 00:57:14,047
...why don't you recall
the Earl of Bothwell?

725
00:57:17,154 --> 00:57:19,714
Let's have no more talk of Bothwell.

726
00:58:09,273 --> 00:58:12,674
- You look surprised, my dear.
- I wish to be alone.

727
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:21,943
Alone?

728
00:58:27,791 --> 00:58:29,588
- Madonna!
- No!

729
00:58:31,361 --> 00:58:33,261
Ruthven, what are you doing here?

730
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:35,694
- Ask your husband.
- Do you know?

731
00:58:42,339 --> 00:58:43,601
Madonna!

732
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:45,605
Let me go! Get out! Get out, all of you!

733
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,971
We intend no harm to anyone
except that traitor.

734
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:50,739
- Traitor? My only friend!
- Aye, too good a friend.

735
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:54,145
- Your husband knows about that.
- I know who the traitors in Scotland are.

736
00:58:54,318 --> 00:58:57,913
Get out of my room! Lay one hand
on Rizzio, I'll see you all destroyed!

737
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:02,888
Quiet. When Scotland finds out we've killed
a rogue in your own bedroom...

738
00:59:03,193 --> 00:59:07,892
If David's done anything wrong, I'll deliver
him up for fair trial, but not to assassins!

739
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,499
After him!

740
00:59:19,743 --> 00:59:22,473
David! David!

741
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:24,712
Oh, no!

742
00:59:27,751 --> 00:59:29,412
David!

743
00:59:34,925 --> 00:59:37,359
Milords. Milords.

744
00:59:37,527 --> 00:59:40,257
Justice. Justice!

745
00:59:47,771 --> 00:59:49,432
Madonna...

746
01:00:05,322 --> 01:00:08,018
You've not only murdered poor David...

747
01:00:08,191 --> 01:00:10,523
...you've ruined me, ruined yourself...

748
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:14,425
...thrown a doubt on the child
I'm going to have, your child.

749
01:00:14,598 --> 01:00:16,896
I only wanted my rights.

750
01:00:17,067 --> 01:00:21,436
God forgive you.
I shall not forgive myself for marrying you.

751
01:00:30,781 --> 01:00:32,180
Am I to follow David?

752
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:35,512
- There's no fear if you do as we say.
- Do you hear that?

753
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:38,950
So long as I'm their prisoner,
and my husband backs them up...

754
01:00:39,122 --> 01:00:42,580
...I'm an unfaithful wife, and the people,
my strength, will turn against me.

755
01:00:42,759 --> 01:00:46,559
Enough. Before we go further,
you'll sign this...

756
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,198
...a full pardon for all of us.
- Never!

757
01:00:49,366 --> 01:00:50,765
- Sign it!
- Ruthven!

758
01:00:50,967 --> 01:00:53,197
She's better off dead
if she doesn't sign it.

759
01:00:53,403 --> 01:00:56,998
Aye, we're better off. If she got away
without signing it, we'd be done for.

760
01:00:57,174 --> 01:00:59,938
This proves our guilt. Sign it!

761
01:01:22,766 --> 01:01:24,165
Sign it.

762
01:01:27,337 --> 01:01:32,172
Ruthven, Bothwell's returned to Edinburgh.
He's marching here.

763
01:01:35,312 --> 01:01:37,177
- How many men has he got?
- Only a handful.

764
01:01:37,347 --> 01:01:39,679
- Let him come.
- He'll raise the country against us.

765
01:01:39,850 --> 01:01:42,375
He won't have a chance. Open the gates.
Let him come in.

766
01:01:42,552 --> 01:01:46,010
We'll post ourselves in the courtyard.
We'll deal a surprise.

767
01:01:46,189 --> 01:01:48,487
No, wait. I'll sign your pardon.

768
01:01:48,658 --> 01:01:51,422
Aye, you'll sign it well enough
with Bothwell in danger.

769
01:01:51,595 --> 01:01:54,029
Darnley, you'll stay here.

770
01:01:58,201 --> 01:01:59,600
Guards.

771
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:32,961
Don't you see what you've done?

772
01:02:33,703 --> 01:02:37,104
They'll kill Bothwell
as they killed poor David.

773
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:39,541
You're only their shield.

774
01:02:40,277 --> 01:02:43,713
How long will they tolerate you
when I'm out of the way?

775
01:02:44,414 --> 01:02:45,972
Why did you do it?

776
01:02:46,182 --> 01:02:49,413
- I wanted to win you back.
- Oh, you're blind.

777
01:02:49,586 --> 01:02:54,523
They had to have you in their scheme
to prove their lie, that I dishonored you.

778
01:02:54,691 --> 01:02:57,956
But once they've dragged me down
before the people...

779
01:02:58,128 --> 01:03:01,325
...what use will they have for you then?

780
01:03:01,498 --> 01:03:04,467
How long will you keep your crown?

781
01:03:05,468 --> 01:03:08,266
You'll find yourself a prisoner,
as I am now.

782
01:03:09,573 --> 01:03:12,565
You'll only be king as long as I'm queen.

783
01:03:13,843 --> 01:03:17,802
You still have a chance to save yourself,
to save us both.

784
01:03:17,981 --> 01:03:20,711
- How?
- Help me escape before they kill Bothwell.

785
01:03:20,884 --> 01:03:23,216
- I can't. They'd kill me.
- Not if you're with me.

786
01:03:23,386 --> 01:03:26,480
They'd run for their lives.
They'd leave Scotland, and you'd be safe.

787
01:03:26,656 --> 01:03:28,681
- With you, Mary?
- Yes, with me.

788
01:03:28,858 --> 01:03:32,692
- You'd forgive me? You wouldn't leave me?
- I swear, I'll never leave you.

789
01:03:35,265 --> 01:03:36,664
Madam.

790
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,436
Her Majesty has retired to her bedroom.

791
01:03:50,614 --> 01:03:53,082
- Stand guard there.
- Aye, milord.

792
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,388
Get Bothwell!

793
01:04:48,905 --> 01:04:50,133
Get her.

794
01:04:50,306 --> 01:04:52,297
Aye, the queen.

795
01:05:13,797 --> 01:05:16,766
- Where's the queen?
- In her bedroom, milord.

796
01:05:26,076 --> 01:05:27,634
Where's Darnley?

797
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:29,905
With the queen, milord.

798
01:05:33,516 --> 01:05:35,143
Will Huntly and his clan join them?

799
01:05:35,318 --> 01:05:38,446
Huntly? Aye, they'll have 10,000
at their backs before morning.

800
01:05:38,621 --> 01:05:41,351
- Aye, and they'll be after us.
- I'm getting out of Scotland.

801
01:05:41,524 --> 01:05:43,355
- I'm with you.
- We're done for, Ruthven.

802
01:05:43,526 --> 01:05:44,823
- Aye.
- She's tricked us.

803
01:05:44,994 --> 01:05:46,222
Never mind her.

804
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:49,593
- But if ever I lay my hands on Darnley...
- It's every man for himself.

805
01:05:49,766 --> 01:05:51,734
Get over the border while there's time.

806
01:07:19,923 --> 01:07:21,390
No.

807
01:07:55,825 --> 01:07:58,760
Mary Stuart has a son.

808
01:08:01,898 --> 01:08:04,628
And I am only a barren stock.

809
01:08:10,306 --> 01:08:12,171
- Where's Moray?
- Vanished...

810
01:08:12,342 --> 01:08:15,243
...with the other lords
who murdered David Rizzio.

811
01:08:15,778 --> 01:08:17,643
I failed.

812
01:08:22,385 --> 01:08:23,977
Failed.

813
01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:33,557
No, I'm not letting you hold the baby.
Now, you're not to touch him.

814
01:08:35,465 --> 01:08:38,525
Now, mind that you give him a bath...

815
01:08:46,242 --> 01:08:48,107
Careful, now. Careful, milady.

816
01:08:48,278 --> 01:08:51,475
- Jamie, Jamie.
- Keep your hand on his wee bit bottom.

817
01:08:52,782 --> 01:08:55,307
Havers, but he's a load, that boy is.

818
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:58,579
But the best man in Scotland,
if you ask me.

819
01:08:58,788 --> 01:09:01,154
He's a bubblyjock, that's what he is.

820
01:09:01,324 --> 01:09:04,555
He ought to be tucked up in bed,
that's what he ought to be.

821
01:09:04,727 --> 01:09:08,663
But being this is his birthday,
he's got to see his mother first.

822
01:09:09,299 --> 01:09:13,599
Of course.
If we don't spoil the bairn, it's a wonder.

823
01:09:13,770 --> 01:09:15,533
He'll grow up into a great big man...

824
01:09:15,705 --> 01:09:18,367
...and take care of me
when I'm an old woman.

825
01:09:18,541 --> 01:09:21,908
She's not much older now
than the wee man himself.

826
01:09:36,526 --> 01:09:38,426
Happy birthday!

827
01:09:43,733 --> 01:09:45,633
Your Majesty.

828
01:09:45,802 --> 01:09:47,667
Here's a present for him.

829
01:09:47,837 --> 01:09:50,465
Howt, man.
What would he do with a claymore?

830
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,542
Aye, wait till he grows up.
He'll need it.

831
01:09:54,711 --> 01:09:57,179
- It was your father's, Mary.
- My father's?

832
01:09:57,347 --> 01:09:59,338
I brought it from Inverness.

833
01:09:59,515 --> 01:10:02,109
Aye, he's a Stuart.

834
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:03,752
Aye.

835
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:06,286
I hope you won't need it, Jamie.

836
01:10:12,528 --> 01:10:15,463
His Majesty, the king.

837
01:10:20,536 --> 01:10:23,937
What a charming family scene.

838
01:10:24,974 --> 01:10:26,965
We were just admiring your son.

839
01:10:27,143 --> 01:10:29,737
Oh, were you, Bothwell?

840
01:10:29,912 --> 01:10:31,846
Yes, he's a year old today.

841
01:10:32,015 --> 01:10:34,210
Of course, that's why
you came back from Glasgow.

842
01:10:52,368 --> 01:10:54,097
I'll put him to bed, sire.

843
01:11:03,079 --> 01:11:05,570
Afraid my presence
will contaminate him?

844
01:11:05,748 --> 01:11:08,478
You know that's not true.
Why have you come back?

845
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:16,147
- Has Ruthven returned to Scotland?
- He wouldn't dare.

846
01:11:16,325 --> 01:11:19,886
- I'd only like to find him if he has.
- You'd like to have me out of the way too.

847
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:22,964
You'd have them all back.
You know what they'd do to me!

848
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:25,828
- You're not yourself. You're worried.
- Ruthven's in Scotland.

849
01:11:26,002 --> 01:11:27,936
- Morton too, secretly.
- They're not.

850
01:11:28,104 --> 01:11:31,005
Don't tell me. You know all about it.

851
01:11:31,174 --> 01:11:34,268
- And you, too, Bothwell.
- You're overwrought. You need sleep.

852
01:11:34,444 --> 01:11:36,503
Sleep?

853
01:11:36,913 --> 01:11:39,848
- Not here.
- What do you mean?

854
01:11:41,284 --> 01:11:46,381
I'll not tell you. You won't trick me again.

855
01:11:46,923 --> 01:11:51,223
- I'm gonna leave Scotland.
- You can't. You forget who you are.

856
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:53,726
What do I care for an empty title?

857
01:11:53,896 --> 01:11:56,660
It's my life. My life, I tell you.

858
01:11:58,101 --> 01:12:00,035
They were my friends...

859
01:12:00,670 --> 01:12:02,729
...Moray and Ruthven.

860
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:07,532
You tricked me...

861
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,610
...turned them against me.

862
01:12:09,779 --> 01:12:13,442
You've never forgiven me,
and never forgotten about Rizzio.

863
01:12:13,616 --> 01:12:16,915
- I kept my word.
- You've never loved me.

864
01:12:17,086 --> 01:12:21,250
I love your son. Think of him.
You can't desert your own son.

865
01:12:23,192 --> 01:12:24,887
I'll disown him.

866
01:12:27,163 --> 01:12:30,257
- I'll deny him his father.
- Your Majesty!

867
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:33,698
Try and make him
king of Scotland and England then!

868
01:12:44,614 --> 01:12:46,548
He doesn't mean it.

869
01:12:46,949 --> 01:12:48,644
He can't.

870
01:12:53,589 --> 01:12:55,318
I've...

871
01:12:55,992 --> 01:12:58,688
I've kept my word with him.

872
01:13:02,098 --> 01:13:04,464
I've endured every...

873
01:13:05,301 --> 01:13:08,862
...insult and every humiliation.

874
01:13:13,209 --> 01:13:15,609
I've done everything...

875
01:13:19,182 --> 01:13:20,774
...but love him.

876
01:13:23,619 --> 01:13:25,849
I've tried, but I...

877
01:13:26,389 --> 01:13:29,881
I can't. I can't.

878
01:13:30,059 --> 01:13:31,526
Mary.

879
01:13:33,362 --> 01:13:36,456
All I ask is to serve you...

880
01:13:36,766 --> 01:13:38,700
...be at your side.

881
01:13:44,073 --> 01:13:45,973
Talk to me about Inverness.

882
01:13:46,142 --> 01:13:49,805
Talk to me about something.
I have to hear somebody talk.

883
01:14:06,762 --> 01:14:11,995
Ten o'clock and all's well!

884
01:14:14,237 --> 01:14:17,229
All's well.

885
01:14:39,895 --> 01:14:41,419
Begone, quickly.

886
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:23,734
Oh, my people...

887
01:15:23,906 --> 01:15:28,570
...a king of Scotland cries out
from his grave...

888
01:15:28,744 --> 01:15:32,475
...for revenge against his murderer!

889
01:15:35,851 --> 01:15:39,685
And is the assassin's name not known?

890
01:15:40,656 --> 01:15:44,990
Those who have vanished
have told me his name.

891
01:15:45,861 --> 01:15:51,458
Aye, who was it that coveted
the hand of the queen?

892
01:15:51,934 --> 01:15:54,960
Bothwell's his name! Bothwell!

893
01:15:57,139 --> 01:16:00,006
Hear, all ye people...

894
01:16:00,543 --> 01:16:04,001
...the prayer of that infant prince...

895
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:07,708
...the child of him who was slain:

896
01:16:08,351 --> 01:16:10,012
"Judge...

897
01:16:10,586 --> 01:16:13,020
...and avenge my cause. "

898
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:18,624
Oh, lord.

899
01:16:48,591 --> 01:16:51,151
Aye, you're my prisoners, Huntly.

900
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:55,127
- Shall I make a fight for it, lassie?
- I want no blood shed on my account.

901
01:16:56,031 --> 01:16:57,498
Where are you taking us?

902
01:16:58,200 --> 01:17:00,498
Dunbar Castle, Your Majesty.

903
01:17:28,764 --> 01:17:30,061
Well, Huntly?

904
01:17:30,232 --> 01:17:32,359
Man, man, do you think I'm blind?

905
01:17:32,535 --> 01:17:35,231
- How so?
- This abduction, as you call it.

906
01:17:35,404 --> 01:17:38,840
- That's my way.
- No, no. 'Tis hers.

907
01:17:39,141 --> 01:17:44,078
If you cannot pull the wool over my eyes,
how do you expect to fool all of Scotland?

908
01:17:44,246 --> 01:17:47,272
I'll take care of myself, Huntly,
and of Mary.

909
01:17:49,518 --> 01:17:53,420
Scotland can point no finger at her
if I marry her this way, against her will.

910
01:17:53,589 --> 01:17:56,387
- Marry her?
- Aye, why not?

911
01:17:56,559 --> 01:17:57,958
You're mad.

912
01:17:58,127 --> 01:17:59,992
You're both mad.

913
01:18:00,629 --> 01:18:04,190
I'd rather be dead, lassie,
than see this night ever come.

914
01:18:04,366 --> 01:18:08,996
You're the Queen of Scotland, and you let
the woman in you blind your senses.

915
01:18:10,105 --> 01:18:12,300
Why, he's not even of our faith.

916
01:18:12,475 --> 01:18:15,000
You've always stood by that until now.

917
01:18:15,978 --> 01:18:19,607
If you go on with this make-believe,
there's naught but disaster ahead of you.

918
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:22,114
She has nothing to do with it, I tell you.

919
01:18:22,284 --> 01:18:25,117
If you feel that way, Huntly,
draw your sword against me.

920
01:18:25,287 --> 01:18:27,915
I'll not draw mine against any friend.

921
01:18:28,090 --> 01:18:29,614
You'll have no friend.

922
01:18:37,633 --> 01:18:39,897
Here, lassie, take this...

923
01:18:40,069 --> 01:18:42,731
...and turn it on yourself
if what you speak is true.

924
01:18:42,905 --> 01:18:45,135
There's honor in that escape.

925
01:18:46,642 --> 01:18:48,269
You may go, if you wish, Huntly.

926
01:18:48,444 --> 01:18:51,811
Go back to Edinburgh. Join Moray
and the rest. Stir up the clans against me.

927
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:53,539
No, no, they'll do that themselves.

928
01:18:53,716 --> 01:18:56,685
You'll put yourselves
in Moray's power again.

929
01:18:57,853 --> 01:19:03,223
Three of the clock, and all's well!

930
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:22,103
- Are you afraid, my Mary?
- No.

931
01:19:22,278 --> 01:19:25,509
- I'll send you back with Huntly.
- Why?

932
01:19:26,081 --> 01:19:28,982
From the very beginning,
I've always belonged to you.

933
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:31,045
I knew it.

934
01:19:49,204 --> 01:19:51,434
How vast the night is.

935
01:19:52,474 --> 01:19:55,534
How bright and wonderful.
I've never seen it like this.

936
01:19:55,711 --> 01:19:57,440
Nor I.

937
01:20:00,482 --> 01:20:02,006
Why, look there.

938
01:20:02,518 --> 01:20:04,884
- Make a wish.
- I have.

939
01:20:06,889 --> 01:20:09,619
They say there's a star for each of us.

940
01:20:10,693 --> 01:20:15,153
I used to imagine that when I was born,
God put a dark star in the sky...

941
01:20:15,331 --> 01:20:17,993
...a star nobody could ever see,
not even me.

942
01:20:19,134 --> 01:20:22,069
And then one night,
I'd see a flash of light...

943
01:20:22,237 --> 01:20:26,640
...and I'd see my star,
but it would be falling, and I'd be gone.

944
01:20:28,744 --> 01:20:32,009
Aye, dark or bright...

945
01:20:32,181 --> 01:20:35,116
...I'll always follow your star, Mary.

946
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:40,520
It was dark because I...
I didn't really exist at all.

947
01:20:40,689 --> 01:20:44,523
I was a dream,
and I was the one who was dreaming it too.

948
01:20:45,160 --> 01:20:47,424
That's absurd, isn't it?

949
01:20:49,865 --> 01:20:53,801
- Perhaps I didn't really exist until I met you.
- Aye.

950
01:20:56,271 --> 01:21:00,105
There was a memory of being a child
in a country like this.

951
01:21:00,275 --> 01:21:03,506
And then they told me
that my father was dead...

952
01:21:03,679 --> 01:21:05,544
...and I cried.

953
01:21:07,616 --> 01:21:11,575
When they told me
that I was Queen of Scotland...

954
01:21:11,754 --> 01:21:14,484
...it didn't mean as much
to me as my dolls.

955
01:21:14,657 --> 01:21:16,625
And then I was very important...

956
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:19,989
...not to myself,
but to grown-up people.

957
01:21:20,863 --> 01:21:24,492
And then, one day,
I caught a glimpse of my star...

958
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:27,996
...and they took me away,
at night, on a ship.

959
01:21:28,537 --> 01:21:30,471
It was all so strange.

960
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:33,005
The sea, vast, like this.

961
01:21:33,676 --> 01:21:36,008
The world seemed enormous.

962
01:21:36,578 --> 01:21:40,036
And then we came to another land,
and they told me it was France.

963
01:21:40,215 --> 01:21:43,946
Everything different.
People singing, laughing.

964
01:21:44,119 --> 01:21:47,748
They were all happier.
I learned to love it all.

965
01:21:47,923 --> 01:21:52,257
After a while, I began to think
that I'd only dreamed Scotland...

966
01:21:52,428 --> 01:21:55,056
...that I'd go on forever
playing in the garden...

967
01:21:55,230 --> 01:21:59,394
...learning French, studying,
hearing music...

968
01:21:59,568 --> 01:22:03,800
...talking to four wise old men
who were my uncles.

969
01:22:07,743 --> 01:22:10,143
One of them was the cardinal of Lorraine.

970
01:22:10,312 --> 01:22:11,677
I liked him best.

971
01:22:11,847 --> 01:22:17,217
He was always telling me I'd marry the son
of the King of France when I grew up.

972
01:22:17,386 --> 01:22:19,786
That seemed silly.
He was just a boy.

973
01:22:19,955 --> 01:22:23,482
We used to fight,
and then I'd chase him, and he'd run away.

974
01:22:24,126 --> 01:22:27,425
Aye, I was in France
when you married him.

975
01:22:27,596 --> 01:22:30,190
I've never forgotten,
all the pomp and ceremony...

976
01:22:30,365 --> 01:22:32,560
...and the great crowd
before the cathedral...

977
01:22:32,735 --> 01:22:35,397
...and the pages carrying your long train.

978
01:22:35,571 --> 01:22:38,836
You weren't even old enough
to be out of short dresses.

979
01:22:40,609 --> 01:22:42,406
I was 16.

980
01:22:43,112 --> 01:22:45,012
It was just an arrangement.

981
01:22:46,348 --> 01:22:47,872
And then, one day...

982
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,383
...his father was killed in a tournament.

983
01:22:51,553 --> 01:22:53,987
And everyone made a great fuss over me.

984
01:22:55,357 --> 01:22:57,655
And I was Queen of France.

985
01:22:59,128 --> 01:23:01,756
But before I could realize it all...

986
01:23:02,231 --> 01:23:04,461
...he died, too, poor boy.

987
01:23:05,134 --> 01:23:07,762
And then I was queen no longer.

988
01:23:09,705 --> 01:23:12,538
And then I came back to my old dream...

989
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,266
...to Scotland.

990
01:23:21,850 --> 01:23:23,442
I was never in love.

991
01:23:23,619 --> 01:23:25,314
You know that.

992
01:23:40,769 --> 01:23:42,498
Amen.

993
01:24:15,771 --> 01:24:20,799
So she summons old Scotland
to take up arms for her?

994
01:24:20,976 --> 01:24:22,204
Will they come?

995
01:24:22,377 --> 01:24:24,811
Only a rabble of moss-troopers
from the border...

996
01:24:24,980 --> 01:24:26,914
...where Bothwell's strength lies.

997
01:24:27,082 --> 01:24:30,483
Mercenaries.
They won't stand up and fight.

998
01:24:30,886 --> 01:24:34,583
- Where's the child?
- Abducted by Moray.

999
01:24:34,756 --> 01:24:36,553
They'll not harm her son.

1000
01:24:36,725 --> 01:24:38,886
Moray's strength depends
on making him king...

1001
01:24:39,061 --> 01:24:41,689
...and ruling as regent
till he comes of age.

1002
01:24:43,098 --> 01:24:47,398
The lords have won most of Scotland
to their cause by convincing John Knox...

1003
01:24:47,569 --> 01:24:50,231
...that Bothwell and the queen
murdered Darnley...

1004
01:24:50,405 --> 01:24:52,202
...to get him out of their way.

1005
01:24:52,374 --> 01:24:54,604
Knox thunders it into the people.

1006
01:24:55,577 --> 01:24:57,135
And after all...

1007
01:24:57,312 --> 01:25:00,873
...what greater proof of their guilty love
than this reckless marriage?

1008
01:25:04,386 --> 01:25:07,480
And I believed I'd failed.

1009
01:25:07,656 --> 01:25:09,624
We shall soon know, Your Majesty.

1010
01:25:09,791 --> 01:25:11,952
The lords are marching on Edinburgh...

1011
01:25:12,127 --> 01:25:15,927
...and they outnumber
Bothwell's defenders five to one.

1012
01:25:40,989 --> 01:25:44,049
Open your gate
for the hosts of the righteous!

1013
01:25:46,595 --> 01:25:47,823
Oh, my people...

1014
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:51,432
...into what pit of abomination
have you fallen?

1015
01:25:51,633 --> 01:25:54,761
'Tis not the true banner of Scotland
that you follow...

1016
01:25:54,937 --> 01:25:59,340
...but the blood-red banner
of murder and treason!

1017
01:25:59,508 --> 01:26:04,969
Remember, a king of Scotland cries out
from his grave to be avenged!

1018
01:26:05,147 --> 01:26:08,776
And will you defend
his murder, Bothwell?

1019
01:26:08,951 --> 01:26:12,011
And will you defend a guilty queen?

1020
01:26:12,187 --> 01:26:17,022
Open the gates
for the host of the righteous!

1021
01:26:17,192 --> 01:26:20,161
Open the gates!

1022
01:26:23,432 --> 01:26:25,662
Are you afraid, Mary?

1023
01:26:27,336 --> 01:26:30,396
Yes, terribly. Terribly.

1024
01:26:30,572 --> 01:26:32,665
That's not my Mary.

1025
01:26:33,508 --> 01:26:35,908
I'm only afraid for you.

1026
01:26:36,078 --> 01:26:38,478
Then you're not afraid at all.

1027
01:26:41,583 --> 01:26:43,278
Flag of truce!

1028
01:27:04,773 --> 01:27:08,834
Bowing comes with a bad grace
from traitors.

1029
01:27:09,011 --> 01:27:11,878
We are not in arms against you,
my sister...

1030
01:27:12,547 --> 01:27:13,775
...only him.

1031
01:27:13,949 --> 01:27:16,941
Before you state your conditions,
Moray...

1032
01:27:17,819 --> 01:27:19,582
...I'll state mine.

1033
01:27:22,224 --> 01:27:25,990
We'll decide the issue by single combat
between you and me.

1034
01:27:26,728 --> 01:27:30,528
Or anyone else you and the other traitors
wish to appoint.

1035
01:27:30,699 --> 01:27:32,690
No, they'll find some way to trick you.

1036
01:27:32,868 --> 01:27:36,463
Hear Moray's conditions.
I beg you, madam.

1037
01:27:36,638 --> 01:27:38,071
I beg you, sir.

1038
01:27:39,007 --> 01:27:40,941
You owe it to the queen.

1039
01:27:43,045 --> 01:27:46,037
Go ahead. What are they?

1040
01:27:48,116 --> 01:27:51,176
- First, that you leave Scotland forever.
- No.

1041
01:27:51,353 --> 01:27:52,786
What else?

1042
01:27:52,954 --> 01:27:56,390
That the queen bind herself
to act only with our consent.

1043
01:27:56,558 --> 01:27:57,786
- No more?
- No more.

1044
01:27:57,959 --> 01:27:59,893
Then here are my conditions!

1045
01:28:00,962 --> 01:28:03,760
You've wanted my earldom.
Well, you may have it.

1046
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:06,426
I'll leave Scotland...

1047
01:28:07,269 --> 01:28:08,702
...if you'll pledge your word...

1048
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:12,533
...that the queen's to keep her throne
and reign here as before.

1049
01:28:12,707 --> 01:28:14,436
But if you break your word...

1050
01:28:14,609 --> 01:28:17,772
...or encroach one inch
on her sovereignty...

1051
01:28:17,946 --> 01:28:22,280
...you guard your gates, for I'll be back.

1052
01:28:22,884 --> 01:28:27,787
I'll see if your terms are acceptable
to my lords.

1053
01:28:38,266 --> 01:28:40,734
Let me live or die at your side.

1054
01:28:40,902 --> 01:28:42,631
I'm your wife.

1055
01:28:42,804 --> 01:28:44,829
- I love you.
- I love you, my Mary.

1056
01:28:45,006 --> 01:28:47,941
What do I lose? Nothing.
You save your throne.

1057
01:28:48,110 --> 01:28:49,577
What's my throne?

1058
01:28:49,744 --> 01:28:53,009
I'd put a torch to it for any one of the days
I've had with you.

1059
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:55,843
- They've been so few.
- Aye, but wonderful days, Mary.

1060
01:28:56,017 --> 01:28:58,042
Twenty wonderful days.

1061
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,120
- Better than a lifetime.
- Take me with you.

1062
01:29:00,288 --> 01:29:03,451
No, no. You're Queen of Scotland.
That's your destiny.

1063
01:29:03,625 --> 01:29:07,117
And I'll love you till the day I die.
That's mine.

1064
01:29:16,071 --> 01:29:17,299
Well, Moray?

1065
01:29:18,473 --> 01:29:21,203
The lords of Scotland accept your terms.

1066
01:29:22,377 --> 01:29:23,810
Very well.

1067
01:29:24,946 --> 01:29:28,313
I wouldn't trust Ruthven's pledge
or Morton's...

1068
01:29:28,483 --> 01:29:32,783
...but after all, corrupt as you are,
you're a Stuart, the son of a king.

1069
01:29:32,954 --> 01:29:36,617
I'll take your word as a Stuart.
But remember, Moray...

1070
01:29:36,791 --> 01:29:38,816
...if you break your pledge...

1071
01:29:38,994 --> 01:29:43,624
...if you ever raise your hand against her,
I'll be back.

1072
01:30:02,083 --> 01:30:03,744
Donal!

1073
01:31:39,281 --> 01:31:41,647
I'll say it to her milk-white face.

1074
01:31:41,816 --> 01:31:43,340
Pluck down the murderers!

1075
01:31:43,518 --> 01:31:46,248
Pluck down this contaminator of men!

1076
01:31:46,421 --> 01:31:50,118
If there's to be a council here,
send out this raving maniac!

1077
01:31:50,292 --> 01:31:54,388
Though you be a queen
and have faith in thy gods and idols...

1078
01:31:54,562 --> 01:31:58,828
...yet in this night of reckoning,
they shall not avail thee.

1079
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:02,060
Moray, I demand his removal.

1080
01:32:03,872 --> 01:32:05,703
Why don't you answer me?

1081
01:32:05,874 --> 01:32:07,739
You shall have to leave your palace.

1082
01:32:07,909 --> 01:32:12,039
- That's at my choice, not yours.
- Not now.

1083
01:32:14,416 --> 01:32:17,010
I'm still your queen.

1084
01:32:17,786 --> 01:32:20,949
You gave your word
that I should rule as before.

1085
01:32:21,389 --> 01:32:23,516
That's impossible now.

1086
01:32:27,896 --> 01:32:29,523
Now...

1087
01:32:30,131 --> 01:32:32,759
...I see your treachery.

1088
01:32:34,803 --> 01:32:38,603
You not only betray your sovereign...

1089
01:32:38,773 --> 01:32:43,710
...you betray yourselves,
your own pledge.

1090
01:32:43,878 --> 01:32:46,813
<i>- We defend Scotland!
- Aye!</i>

1091
01:32:46,981 --> 01:32:49,472
You may remain here
if you'll sign what we dictate.

1092
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:54,286
And what do you dictate?

1093
01:32:55,390 --> 01:32:57,517
Your abdication.

1094
01:32:57,692 --> 01:33:00,718
And you consent to have
your son crowned king.

1095
01:33:00,895 --> 01:33:03,159
And appoint me regent
till he comes of age.

1096
01:33:04,899 --> 01:33:07,129
I refuse.

1097
01:33:07,869 --> 01:33:10,394
- We'll change your mind.
- Remember Bothwell's warning.

1098
01:33:10,572 --> 01:33:12,563
- He'll come back.
- With his army disbanded?

1099
01:33:12,741 --> 01:33:15,642
And the price of 1000 crowns
on his head?

1100
01:33:15,910 --> 01:33:17,400
So long as I live...

1101
01:33:17,579 --> 01:33:21,538
...no power on earth shall take my throne
away from me.

1102
01:33:21,716 --> 01:33:23,946
Come, lock me up.

1103
01:33:24,119 --> 01:33:27,555
I'll bide my time and wait for Bothwell.

1104
01:33:42,437 --> 01:33:46,271
Milord Throckmorton,
ambassador to Scotland.

1105
01:33:46,941 --> 01:33:49,307
What news from Scotland?

1106
01:33:52,213 --> 01:33:54,909
- Bothwell has been defeated.
- Was he taken?

1107
01:33:55,083 --> 01:33:57,347
No, Your Majesty.
He escaped to Denmark...

1108
01:33:57,519 --> 01:34:01,421
...where he hopes to raise arms and money
for a final blow against Moray.

1109
01:34:01,823 --> 01:34:04,291
But I have more important news for you.

1110
01:34:04,459 --> 01:34:07,292
The son of Mary Stuart
has been crowned king...

1111
01:34:07,462 --> 01:34:11,091
...and Moray rules again as regent.
- Then she's abdicated.

1112
01:34:11,266 --> 01:34:14,064
- So Moray claims.
- She's still in prison?

1113
01:34:14,235 --> 01:34:16,795
At Lochleven. I've seen her.

1114
01:34:17,005 --> 01:34:21,203
She asks for Your Majesty's support
of her cause against the rebels...

1115
01:34:21,376 --> 01:34:24,709
...and asks that you remember
that if you favor rebellion in Scotland...

1116
01:34:25,346 --> 01:34:27,871
...you may eventually see it in England.

1117
01:34:28,049 --> 01:34:29,949
"Rebellion. "

1118
01:34:31,085 --> 01:34:33,747
How I hate that word.

1119
01:34:33,922 --> 01:34:35,287
Remember, Your Majesty...

1120
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:39,927
...your security depends upon
her being behind bars.

1121
01:34:40,862 --> 01:34:43,490
But can I support rebellion...

1122
01:34:43,665 --> 01:34:46,759
...so near to my own throne?

1123
01:34:47,735 --> 01:34:48,963
Remember that.

1124
01:34:51,606 --> 01:34:56,305
Neither can I afford to take sides,
so long as Bothwell lives.

1125
01:34:56,478 --> 01:34:58,412
If Moray's plans succeed...

1126
01:34:58,580 --> 01:35:04,280
...he will be caged in Denmark for good,
on some pretext or other.

1127
01:35:05,186 --> 01:35:07,381
Return to Scotland.

1128
01:35:07,722 --> 01:35:11,852
Tell Moray that in the eyes of the world,
he is a rebel, a traitor!

1129
01:35:12,026 --> 01:35:15,518
- Therefore, I shall oppose him publicly...
- Your Majesty...

1130
01:35:15,697 --> 01:35:18,359
...yet support him privately.

1131
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:20,698
And Mary Stuart?

1132
01:35:28,276 --> 01:35:30,176
Give her this ring...

1133
01:35:30,345 --> 01:35:33,906
...as a token of my friendship
and support.

1134
01:35:34,082 --> 01:35:36,380
- But she will ask...
- I know what she will ask.

1135
01:35:36,551 --> 01:35:39,315
And we'll put her off. Procrastinate.

1136
01:35:39,487 --> 01:35:41,648
Months. Years.

1137
01:35:48,296 --> 01:35:51,732
There's security in that.

1138
01:37:34,736 --> 01:37:36,636
I won't say I wasn't frightened...

1139
01:37:37,972 --> 01:37:41,237
...when you tapped at the door before
daylight like a bird blown in off the sea.

1140
01:37:41,409 --> 01:37:43,934
Go and sit down, ma'am.
It's poor victuals for fine folks...

1141
01:37:44,112 --> 01:37:47,240
...but it's all we've got,
and you're welcome to it.

1142
01:37:56,057 --> 01:37:58,150
I have a little boy like you.

1143
01:37:58,326 --> 01:38:01,022
Does he sit in a highchair too?

1144
01:38:01,195 --> 01:38:04,096
He wants to know
if he sits in a highchair too.

1145
01:38:04,265 --> 01:38:06,028
Oh, yes...

1146
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,259
...in a very high chair.

1147
01:38:12,173 --> 01:38:16,200
For what we are about to receive,
may the Lord make us truly thankful.

1148
01:38:16,944 --> 01:38:18,172
Amen.

1149
01:38:27,321 --> 01:38:29,289
Thomas, who's that?

1150
01:38:41,636 --> 01:38:43,365
Your Majesty.

1151
01:38:43,538 --> 01:38:45,028
You come from Elizabeth?

1152
01:38:45,206 --> 01:38:49,404
Yes, Your Majesty. I've come
to conduct you to a place of security.

1153
01:38:49,577 --> 01:38:51,670
I thank Her Majesty.

1154
01:38:51,846 --> 01:38:54,644
I stand in need of her friendship now.

1155
01:39:03,558 --> 01:39:05,185
Thank you, my kind friend.

1156
01:39:16,170 --> 01:39:18,968
This will be your apartment,
Your Majesty.

1157
01:39:20,208 --> 01:39:22,039
Sir Francis Knollys...

1158
01:39:22,210 --> 01:39:23,643
...your host.

1159
01:39:23,811 --> 01:39:25,403
Thank you. Thank you.

1160
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,639
How wonderful to be free again.

1161
01:39:27,815 --> 01:39:30,875
Where is Elizabeth?
Am I to see her now, at last?

1162
01:39:31,085 --> 01:39:33,349
I want to thank her. Where is she?

1163
01:39:36,758 --> 01:39:40,353
I place this lady in your custody, sir.

1164
01:39:40,561 --> 01:39:41,994
Custody?

1165
01:39:42,163 --> 01:39:43,790
What do you mean?

1166
01:39:46,534 --> 01:39:50,061
England has no jurisdiction over me.

1167
01:39:50,238 --> 01:39:52,570
I asked Elizabeth for refuge.

1168
01:39:53,074 --> 01:39:55,008
She promised it.

1169
01:39:58,579 --> 01:40:00,308
Am I a prisoner?

1170
01:40:05,052 --> 01:40:07,384
I demand an answer!

1171
01:41:00,708 --> 01:41:03,176
- It's only the storm, sir.
- Listen, Donal.

1172
01:41:04,078 --> 01:41:06,842
It's my pipers. They're coming, I tell you!

1173
01:41:07,014 --> 01:41:10,381
- Lie down, sir, please, you're sick.
- No, Donal, they're marching up, man!

1174
01:41:10,551 --> 01:41:12,416
We'll win yet!

1175
01:41:20,995 --> 01:41:22,553
I thought I heard...

1176
01:41:22,730 --> 01:41:24,493
Sir, lie down, please.

1177
01:41:26,968 --> 01:41:28,265
Open up here!

1178
01:41:28,769 --> 01:41:32,000
Open up here! Open up!

1179
01:41:32,173 --> 01:41:36,974
Still out of his mind, eh? These Scotsmen
have the power of the devil in them.

1180
01:41:37,144 --> 01:41:39,977
Prison fever's a good match for the devil.

1181
01:41:40,348 --> 01:41:41,679
Open up here!

1182
01:41:41,883 --> 01:41:43,441
Open up!

1183
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:47,747
Sir, you're not yourself.
Please lie down, sir.

1184
01:41:47,922 --> 01:41:51,255
Now, Donal, I'm getting out.
I'll get out tonight.

1185
01:41:51,425 --> 01:41:53,120
Tonight, I tell you!

1186
01:41:56,063 --> 01:41:57,860
There it is again. You hear?

1187
01:41:58,032 --> 01:41:59,363
What, sir?

1188
01:41:59,533 --> 01:42:00,830
The pipes, Donal.

1189
01:42:01,002 --> 01:42:02,560
Listen.

1190
01:42:03,838 --> 01:42:05,931
Donal, go to England.

1191
01:42:06,107 --> 01:42:08,041
Find her, tell her I'm out.

1192
01:42:08,209 --> 01:42:10,336
I'm free. I'll free her too.

1193
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:14,208
Tell her... Tell her she'll hear the pipes
when I come to her.

1194
01:42:14,382 --> 01:42:15,849
Tell her to listen.

1195
01:42:16,017 --> 01:42:18,952
Tell her my pipers... My pipers...

1196
01:42:19,120 --> 01:42:20,815
My pipers are coming.

1197
01:42:23,157 --> 01:42:25,057
Sir. Sir.

1198
01:42:25,226 --> 01:42:28,059
Speak. Speak to Donal, sir.

1199
01:42:30,298 --> 01:42:32,766
My laddie, my laddie.

1200
01:42:40,274 --> 01:42:41,605
What's wrong with him?

1201
01:42:47,148 --> 01:42:49,309
You cannot hurt him now.

1202
01:42:51,085 --> 01:42:52,313
Aye...

1203
01:42:52,486 --> 01:42:54,545
...he spoke true.

1204
01:42:57,091 --> 01:42:59,184
He's free.

1205
01:43:52,346 --> 01:43:55,338
Bring in the prisoner.

1206
01:44:34,455 --> 01:44:36,548
Am I to see Elizabeth at last?

1207
01:44:36,724 --> 01:44:39,887
Her Majesty is present, symbolically.

1208
01:44:43,297 --> 01:44:46,095
The accused will be seated.

1209
01:44:49,770 --> 01:44:52,330
I prefer to stand...

1210
01:44:52,907 --> 01:44:54,340
...symbolically.

1211
01:44:56,177 --> 01:44:58,543
Do you acknowledge
the jurisdiction of this court?

1212
01:44:59,413 --> 01:45:01,813
Not of this court, nor of Elizabeth.

1213
01:45:01,982 --> 01:45:05,577
There are no examples of sovereigns
condemned by courts of law.

1214
01:45:05,753 --> 01:45:11,214
In Rome, the tetrarch Cajetanus
was put to death by a trial.

1215
01:45:11,392 --> 01:45:13,883
There is another precedent.

1216
01:45:14,061 --> 01:45:18,725
Licinius, brother-in-law
of the emperor Constantine.

1217
01:45:18,899 --> 01:45:22,357
Not to forget Joanna of Naples.

1218
01:45:22,536 --> 01:45:25,232
You go back 1500 years?

1219
01:45:25,739 --> 01:45:29,175
Go back to Pontius Pilate,
who condemned to the cross...

1220
01:45:29,343 --> 01:45:32,870
...a sovereign greater than the world
has ever known.

1221
01:45:33,681 --> 01:45:37,981
And remind Elizabeth what happened
to the memory of Pontius Pilate.

1222
01:45:38,152 --> 01:45:40,620
Please remember
that you are the accused.

1223
01:45:41,689 --> 01:45:43,418
Accused?

1224
01:45:43,858 --> 01:45:45,086
Of what?

1225
01:45:45,259 --> 01:45:48,160
Of attempting to take the life
of our sovereign lady...

1226
01:45:48,329 --> 01:45:49,762
...the Queen of England.

1227
01:45:51,565 --> 01:45:53,123
I have lain in prison...

1228
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:56,098
...ever since I came to this land.

1229
01:45:56,270 --> 01:45:59,467
Even had I wished it,
how could I make such an attempt?

1230
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:04,873
By conspiring with certain English subjects
of your religious persuasion...

1231
01:46:05,045 --> 01:46:08,606
...to wit, Anthony Babington.

1232
01:46:08,782 --> 01:46:13,742
A true friend who sought only to release me
from unjust imprisonment.

1233
01:46:14,655 --> 01:46:16,282
Where is he?

1234
01:46:16,457 --> 01:46:19,255
Executed for treason.

1235
01:46:20,961 --> 01:46:22,792
And his friends?

1236
01:46:22,963 --> 01:46:26,023
Executed for treason.

1237
01:46:32,039 --> 01:46:35,202
Poor, generous friends.

1238
01:46:39,480 --> 01:46:42,779
So the first step to prove me guilty...

1239
01:46:42,950 --> 01:46:46,977
...is to murder those who would prove
me innocent?

1240
01:46:47,154 --> 01:46:52,251
The accused will confine herself
to answering questions, not framing them.

1241
01:46:54,828 --> 01:46:56,853
I am the accuser here...

1242
01:46:57,031 --> 01:46:59,226
...not the accused.

1243
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:03,234
I accuse Elizabeth of treachery
and plotting against my life...

1244
01:47:03,404 --> 01:47:05,167
...not I against hers.

1245
01:47:05,339 --> 01:47:10,777
Do you deny secretly communicating
with the aforesaid Anthony Babington?

1246
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:18,912
Do any of you deny that you would try
to escape from unjust imprisonment?

1247
01:47:19,787 --> 01:47:24,884
Do you know what it means to be shut up
from everything you love...

1248
01:47:25,492 --> 01:47:27,858
...from your husband...

1249
01:47:28,028 --> 01:47:30,792
...your son, your own people...

1250
01:47:31,532 --> 01:47:34,296
...confined like an animal...

1251
01:47:35,536 --> 01:47:41,839
...until each day grows so long
that it seems a lifetime?

1252
01:47:45,312 --> 01:47:48,645
Yes, I smuggled out letters.

1253
01:47:48,816 --> 01:47:52,081
Isn't it true that you approved a plot
against the life of our queen?

1254
01:47:53,187 --> 01:47:57,283
As true as to say
that you are honest men.

1255
01:47:57,458 --> 01:48:00,586
Isn't this written
in your own handwriting?!

1256
01:48:01,362 --> 01:48:03,489
The way you shout, milord, tells me...

1257
01:48:03,664 --> 01:48:06,224
...even at this distance,
that it is a forgery.

1258
01:48:07,801 --> 01:48:10,929
Will you confine yourself
to answering questions?

1259
01:48:11,105 --> 01:48:13,665
I have heard no questions...

1260
01:48:14,575 --> 01:48:18,170
...only accusations phrased like questions.

1261
01:48:18,946 --> 01:48:22,382
But why prolong this mockery?

1262
01:48:23,083 --> 01:48:27,486
Elizabeth, fearing there might be a real plot
to take her life and put me on her throne...

1263
01:48:27,655 --> 01:48:32,991
...has invented a false plot
so that I may be condemned to death.

1264
01:48:34,194 --> 01:48:38,654
But, still, she fears to spring her trap
because of Bothwell.

1265
01:48:39,767 --> 01:48:43,828
She knows he wins support
for my cause abroad.

1266
01:48:44,004 --> 01:48:46,336
And when he returns this time...

1267
01:48:46,507 --> 01:48:50,944
...he'll carry the field in Scotland,
and I'll be queen again.

1268
01:48:51,111 --> 01:48:54,478
While he lives, I'll live.

1269
01:48:54,648 --> 01:48:57,515
Bring in the other prisoner.

1270
01:49:12,366 --> 01:49:13,890
Your Majesty.

1271
01:49:14,568 --> 01:49:16,195
Donal.

1272
01:49:16,370 --> 01:49:18,702
I tried my best to reach you, ma'am...

1273
01:49:18,872 --> 01:49:21,397
...but I couldn't get past your jailer.

1274
01:49:21,575 --> 01:49:22,974
And I was taken.

1275
01:49:23,677 --> 01:49:25,042
Donal...

1276
01:49:25,646 --> 01:49:27,443
...where is he?

1277
01:49:28,215 --> 01:49:29,773
Where's Bothwell?

1278
01:49:32,986 --> 01:49:34,613
No.

1279
01:49:35,789 --> 01:49:37,313
No.

1280
01:49:42,463 --> 01:49:46,194
He... He spoke of you at the last, ma'am.

1281
01:49:46,533 --> 01:49:48,194
He said...

1282
01:49:48,369 --> 01:49:51,304
He said he'd be waiting for you...

1283
01:49:53,040 --> 01:49:55,065
...with the bagpipes playing.

1284
01:50:09,523 --> 01:50:11,684
And all the time...

1285
01:50:13,327 --> 01:50:15,090
...you knew.

1286
01:50:20,667 --> 01:50:22,828
Now I see.

1287
01:50:24,905 --> 01:50:27,305
Now I understand.

1288
01:50:31,278 --> 01:50:32,905
Condemn me.

1289
01:50:34,548 --> 01:50:36,379
Kill me.

1290
01:50:38,252 --> 01:50:39,947
I don't care.

1291
01:51:37,411 --> 01:51:41,745
Ten of the clock, and all's well!

1292
01:51:42,583 --> 01:51:45,245
All's well.

1293
01:51:45,419 --> 01:51:47,478
All's well.

1294
01:51:51,158 --> 01:51:54,321
Strengthen me
as thou alone can strengthen.

1295
01:51:55,462 --> 01:51:59,262
Comfort me in this,
the hour of my agony...

1296
01:52:00,467 --> 01:52:02,662
...and may thy will be done.

1297
01:52:48,682 --> 01:52:50,240
Elizabeth.

1298
01:52:51,618 --> 01:52:54,314
I've only seen a poor likeness.

1299
01:52:56,089 --> 01:52:57,886
But, yes...

1300
01:52:58,559 --> 01:53:00,584
...you are Elizabeth.

1301
01:53:00,794 --> 01:53:02,056
At last.

1302
01:53:02,896 --> 01:53:04,625
Aye.

1303
01:53:05,265 --> 01:53:07,062
A Stuart.

1304
01:53:09,169 --> 01:53:11,535
I see now why men love you.

1305
01:53:12,072 --> 01:53:13,562
Even now...

1306
01:53:13,740 --> 01:53:17,437
...standing where I am,
my last night in this world...

1307
01:53:17,611 --> 01:53:20,774
...I wouldn't change places
with Elizabeth.

1308
01:53:22,649 --> 01:53:25,209
I might've known you'd come...

1309
01:53:25,552 --> 01:53:27,486
...to gloat like this.

1310
01:53:27,854 --> 01:53:29,321
Stealthily...

1311
01:53:29,489 --> 01:53:31,650
...under cover of night...

1312
01:53:32,025 --> 01:53:35,586
...as you've done everything
to destroy me.

1313
01:53:35,762 --> 01:53:37,923
And you've done nothing
to destroy me?

1314
01:53:38,098 --> 01:53:40,828
- When was I your enemy?
- Always.

1315
01:53:41,001 --> 01:53:45,335
- Always, your life was a threat to mine.
- How? Why?

1316
01:53:46,106 --> 01:53:49,542
You were born too close to my throne.

1317
01:53:49,910 --> 01:53:52,071
It was you or I.

1318
01:53:54,181 --> 01:53:57,810
A knife planted between my shoulders...

1319
01:53:58,085 --> 01:54:00,451
...and my kingdom was yours.

1320
01:54:00,621 --> 01:54:02,248
I never wished it.

1321
01:54:02,789 --> 01:54:05,257
But you'd have taken it if it came.

1322
01:54:05,425 --> 01:54:07,188
Ah, yes.

1323
01:54:08,595 --> 01:54:10,756
You're not even a woman.

1324
01:54:12,332 --> 01:54:14,300
I'm a queen.

1325
01:54:18,472 --> 01:54:20,406
You've been a woman.

1326
01:54:21,508 --> 01:54:23,100
See where it's brought you.

1327
01:54:23,944 --> 01:54:28,142
It has brought me happiness
you'll never know, Elizabeth.

1328
01:54:28,849 --> 01:54:32,649
I wouldn't give up the memory
of one day with Bothwell...

1329
01:54:32,819 --> 01:54:35,811
...for a century of your life.

1330
01:54:35,989 --> 01:54:39,254
What do you know of my life?

1331
01:54:39,426 --> 01:54:41,417
You were born a queen.

1332
01:54:41,595 --> 01:54:43,756
Honors, thrones...

1333
01:54:43,930 --> 01:54:46,421
...everything fell into your lap.

1334
01:54:47,067 --> 01:54:50,002
What do you know
of the struggle for power?

1335
01:54:50,203 --> 01:54:52,398
I started with nothing...

1336
01:54:52,572 --> 01:54:56,406
...robbed even of a name,
not acknowledged by my father.

1337
01:54:56,576 --> 01:55:00,034
My own mother, yes, Anne Boleyn...

1338
01:55:00,213 --> 01:55:02,010
...was executed.

1339
01:55:03,183 --> 01:55:06,914
And I learned how a woman
may be a queen one day...

1340
01:55:07,087 --> 01:55:10,352
...and stand on the scaffold the next.

1341
01:55:11,158 --> 01:55:14,184
I was sent to the tower
by my own sister.

1342
01:55:14,695 --> 01:55:16,925
I know what prisons are...

1343
01:55:17,297 --> 01:55:21,529
...being threatened month after month
with execution.

1344
01:55:23,437 --> 01:55:26,235
I died a thousand times.

1345
01:55:27,808 --> 01:55:30,436
But I fought my way upward...

1346
01:55:30,610 --> 01:55:32,601
...inch by inch...

1347
01:55:32,779 --> 01:55:35,145
...until I wore the crown.

1348
01:55:35,515 --> 01:55:38,313
I gave my love to no men...

1349
01:55:38,485 --> 01:55:42,080
...but to my kingdom, to England.

1350
01:55:42,255 --> 01:55:45,281
And you prate to me of love.

1351
01:55:45,525 --> 01:55:47,652
What do you know of my life?

1352
01:55:47,828 --> 01:55:51,559
I know it's been a failure,
a magnificent failure.

1353
01:55:51,732 --> 01:55:54,667
It's you who failed, not I.

1354
01:55:54,835 --> 01:55:57,702
You threw away a kingdom for love.

1355
01:55:58,505 --> 01:55:59,767
For Bothwell.

1356
01:56:00,707 --> 01:56:02,538
Aye.

1357
01:56:03,143 --> 01:56:06,408
And I'd do it again a thousand times.

1358
01:56:09,382 --> 01:56:12,010
You were always afraid of me.

1359
01:56:12,919 --> 01:56:15,319
You're afraid of me still.

1360
01:56:16,656 --> 01:56:21,218
You know my blood will stain you.
You'll never wash it off.

1361
01:56:22,162 --> 01:56:24,756
And the pity of it is, Elizabeth...

1362
01:56:25,499 --> 01:56:27,262
...that you and I...

1363
01:56:27,434 --> 01:56:29,732
...we might have been friends.

1364
01:56:31,638 --> 01:56:34,368
Do you think I want your death?

1365
01:56:34,741 --> 01:56:39,178
- Mary Stuart, save yourself.
- How?

1366
01:56:39,346 --> 01:56:41,974
Renounce your Stuart claim to my throne.

1367
01:56:42,149 --> 01:56:46,313
- Sign your name to it.
- Still driven by fear.

1368
01:56:46,486 --> 01:56:48,750
Fear of me even dead.

1369
01:56:48,922 --> 01:56:53,382
- So that's why you came here tonight.
- Renounce your claim and live.

1370
01:56:53,560 --> 01:56:57,519
You've always loved power,
cherished it fiercely.

1371
01:56:57,697 --> 01:57:01,098
I've loved as a woman loves,
lost as a woman loses.

1372
01:57:01,268 --> 01:57:03,293
But, still, I win.

1373
01:57:03,470 --> 01:57:05,199
You have no heir.

1374
01:57:05,372 --> 01:57:07,932
My son will inherit your throne.

1375
01:57:08,108 --> 01:57:10,736
My son will rule England.

1376
01:57:10,911 --> 01:57:14,244
Still, still, I win!

1377
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:26,284
Your Majesty...

1378
01:58:26,653 --> 01:58:28,883
...it is time.

1379
01:58:31,825 --> 01:58:33,816
Your Majesty...

1380
01:58:36,129 --> 01:58:38,029
...it is time.

1381
01:58:51,011 --> 01:58:52,444
Even...

1382
01:58:54,247 --> 01:58:58,308
Even as thine arms were spread
upon the cross...

1383
01:58:58,885 --> 01:59:02,343
...so receive me into the arms of mercy.

1384
01:59:06,693 --> 01:59:08,923
And forgive me my sins.

1385
02:03:25,451 --> 02:03:27,442
