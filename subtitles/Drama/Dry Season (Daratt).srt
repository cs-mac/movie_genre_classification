1
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,273
Atim...

2
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,149
Atim...

3
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,873
Where are you?

4
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,318
Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,755
You are listening
to national radio.

6
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,637
Everyone is waiting

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,713
for the results of the Commission
of Truth and Justice.

8
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,917
In precisely five minutes,
the President of the Commission

9
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,672
will address the nation.

10
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,197
Atim, where have you gone?

11
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,315
They're announcing the news
on the radio.

12
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,350
The President of the Commission
of Truth and Justice.

13
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,396
Fellow citizens,

14
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,278
the Commission of Truth and Justice

15
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,512
has finally finished its work
on crimes committed

16
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,989
during the civil war.

17
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,311
During our work,
which has taken six months,

18
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,516
we have interrogated

19
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,750
200 war criminals,

20
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,310
and heard over 600
victims and witnesses.

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:19,430
The Commission makes
a solemn appeal

22
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,069
to end the cycle of war
that has eaten away at our country

23
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,912
for more than 40 years.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,279
Thus the Commission
of Truth and Justice has decided

25
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,750
upon a general amnesty
throughout the land...

26
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:52,869
Grandfather, how could this happen?

27
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,036
Atim, where are you going?

28
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,634
This...

29
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,558
belonged to your father.

30
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,155
It hasn't been used in a long time.

31
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,713
My son...

32
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,435
was as brave as a lion.

33
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,392
Be cautious.

34
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,913
Be careful.

35
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,429
Nassara is a dangerous man.

36
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,158
I shall go into the desert.

37
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,073
I shall pray God to watch over you.

38
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,356
When your mission's over,

39
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,556
you'll find me under the jujube tree.

40
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,999
God protect you.

41
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,673
Be careful.

42
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,759
DRY SEASON

43
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,077
Who are you looking at?

44
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,072
Talk, fool. I asked you a question.

45
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,189
Scared, are you?

46
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,188
My father's killer was never charged.

47
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:16,510
He lives in total freedom.

48
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,114
I never knew my father.

49
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,634
He was killed before I was born.

50
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,871
That's why I'm called Atim,
the orphan.

51
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:42,033
Hey, that's enough. Stop, stop.

52
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,759
You want to kill him? That's enough.

53
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,274
- Watch it, you.
- Watch it!

54
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,839
Puppets!

55
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,394
Dear God!

56
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,156
You're not from N'djamena.

57
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,435
Where are you from, yokel?

58
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,988
Don't call me that again, OK?

59
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,878
I don't know you, you don't know me.

60
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,957
Wait! Let me talk to you.

61
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,793
You know what? I like you, kid.

62
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,359
No "kid", either.

63
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,149
All I wanted was... Wait!

64
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,039
You're bleeding.

65
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,673
Here.

66
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,633
My name is Moussa.

67
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,839
And you?

68
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,194
This is my aunt.

69
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,959
- Hello, Biba.
- Hello, son.

70
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,917
This is a friend.

71
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,877
He'll stay with us for a few days.

72
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,190
Hello, ma'am.

73
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:36,556
- He's from America.
- America?

74
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,359
- Yes.
- And I'm from Mars!

75
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,029
You're always bringing people home.

76
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,076
This isn't a hotel.

77
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:50,948
It's not every day
we get someone from America.

78
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,397
Come on.

79
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,229
Take it.

80
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,351
Is it dirty money?

81
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,959
Who are you, Mr Clean?

82
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,996
You're tiresome.

83
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,632
I'm tiresome? Simple country boy!

84
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,072
You know the story of the guy

85
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,038
who wants rid of his shadow
at any price?

86
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,798
This man runs everywhere.

87
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,791
All the time. Like a madman.

88
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,830
Each time he stops,
he turns around

89
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,480
and sees his shadow behind him.

90
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,790
One day his shadow says, irritably,

91
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,394
"Why tire yourself out?

92
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:49,439
"You'll only get rid of me the day
you accomplish your mission."

93
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,751
You lose. You lose.

94
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,069
Just what do you want?

95
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,438
Not charity.

96
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,592
If it's work you want, come back tomorrow.

97
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,957
Aïcha, bring me a glass.

98
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,312
This is my wife, Aïcha.

99
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,831
Making bread

100
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:31,879
requires love and attention.

101
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,712
Without love,

102
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,109
the bread is not good.

103
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,633
You see?

104
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,233
You like it here?

105
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,991
Then I'll make a great baker of you.

106
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,317
Are you from Moussoro?

107
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,754
No, Abéché. In the Wadday region.

108
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:51,354
Where did you get your scarification?

109
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,793
Will you come to the mosque?

110
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,078
You are Muslim, aren't you?

111
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,348
It doesn't matter, I was like that before.

112
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,759
Before what?

113
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,520
Going to the mosque won't redeem you.

114
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,838
Hello?

115
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:37,914
Hello?

116
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,394
Shit!

117
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,029
Hello?

118
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,553
Yes, Moussa.

119
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,155
No, no.

120
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,958
I don't want to carry on
with these little scams.

121
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,917
I didn't come here for that.

122
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,076
Yes, we can meet up.

123
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,355
OK.

124
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,839
So are you!

125
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,272
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

126
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,599
Sometimes I can't control myself.

127
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,036
I can even be dangerous.

128
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,033
You know, I've done a lot of harm
in my life.

129
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,633
Like what, for instance?

130
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,479
I go where I want, Nassara.

131
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:25,836
If you're not happy, complain to the WTO.

132
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,918
Why did you marry him?

133
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,631
He's too old, is that it?

134
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,040
It was my parents, I had no choice.

135
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,874
Tell me, what is this thing?

136
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,276
It was during the civil war.

137
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,033
He was sleeping.
Someone tried to slit his throat.

138
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:39,274
"Aïcha, bring me my shoes."

139
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,433
About the bread...

140
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,231
I forgot the yeast.

141
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,675
You still won't come to the mosque?

142
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:43,118
The unrest continues.

143
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,272
This morning, several
hundred people demonstrated

144
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,793
in front of the Ministry.

145
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,156
Our reporter gathered
some reactions.

146
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,878
This amnesty imposes total impunity.

147
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,793
As long as impunity
reigns in this country,

148
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,154
there'll be no peace.

149
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,869
The blood our families shed
must be paid back.

150
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:06,396
We will continue to demonstrate
our indignation...

151
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,399
Shit!

152
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,472
May God curse the electric company!

153
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,312
Nothing but trouble.

154
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,756
What is your father's name?

155
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,954
My father?

156
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,357
Do you really want to know?

157
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,438
Have you lost something?

158
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,598
Soon it is Ramadan.

159
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,710
I'll be alone in this great big house.

160
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,631
Breaking the fast alone is hard.

161
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,119
I want you to keep me company.

162
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,396
Come and live here.

163
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,991
My back is killing me!

164
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,272
God in heaven!

165
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,558
You like your room?

166
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,629
Yes.

167
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,239
You know the ropes now.
Today you can work alone.

168
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:06,870
Just don't forget the yeast.

169
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,395
Sorry.

170
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:46,039
Going to the mosque?

171
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,237
Is your back still bad?

172
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:56,792
Who's this young man?

173
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,279
This is my son.

174
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,193
Good old Nassara! You hid him well.

175
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,108
Listen, you.

176
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:10,156
You're not my father.

177
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,673
You got that?

178
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,552
Atim, please, don't leave me alone.

179
01:04:24,920 --> 01:04:28,469
Help me put on my support belt.

180
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,675
Take whichever you like, it'll come in useful.

181
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:48,149
A man needs a gun.

182
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,756
We're looking for Mr Abdallah Yussuf,
known as Nassara.

183
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,751
You must come to the police station
tomorrow at eight.

184
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:41,920
The new bakery reported you.

185
01:06:44,040 --> 01:06:46,395
You attacked the driver

186
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:48,391
and you broke his...

187
01:09:26,160 --> 01:09:27,912
Hey, kid,

188
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,195
it does you good to piss.

189
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:34,000
As the Italians say,

190
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,674
"Whosoever doesn't piss in company

191
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:40,957
"is a voyeur or a thief."

192
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:43,359
You get it?

193
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:50,669
But I know you.

194
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,159
I know you.

195
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,197
Hello, brother. Do you have a cigarette?

196
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,429
Thanks.

197
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:49,509
I'm Adoum Abatcha's son.
Remember him?

198
01:13:51,920 --> 01:13:54,957
My baby. My poor baby.

199
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:53,271
We're not working today.

200
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:08,790
Let's go home.

201
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:19,548
God has abandoned me, Atim.

202
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:27,918
Nobody around here likes me, I know that.

203
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:34,396
You hate me too. I can see it in your eyes.

204
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:44,314
Do you love me?

205
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:51,557
Not even a little bit?

206
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,039
Say something.

207
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:00,113
Let's go home.

208
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,988
I want to adopt you as my son.

209
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,996
For that, I need your parents' agreement.

210
01:20:01,080 --> 01:20:03,116
Your father's, especially.

211
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:14,197
Where is your father?

212
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,432
Atim, please wait.

213
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,672
He likes you a lot, you know.

214
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,876
He'd be so pleased.

215
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:51,351
Do it for me.

216
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:13,951
It's over, I'm going.

217
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:17,309
Going where?

218
01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:28,471
Can't it wait?

219
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,276
The feast of Ramadan is near.

220
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:38,478
Son, listen.

221
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:42,353
You're very important to me, you know.

222
01:22:46,440 --> 01:22:49,113
Since you've been here, I've felt alive.

223
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,748
I'll come with you.

224
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,592
To meet your family.

225
01:23:02,760 --> 01:23:04,478
You can't do that.

226
01:23:07,880 --> 01:23:10,838
I want your father's permission

227
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,960
to adopt you.

228
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,110
We'll live together.

229
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,149
Atim?

230
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,233
You're not alone?

231
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:41,792
You brought him?

232
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,795
He hasn't forgotten me, has he?

233
01:25:51,440 --> 01:25:53,351
I am Oumar Abatcha.

234
01:25:56,960 --> 01:26:00,316
May he suffer the same fate as my son.

235
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,914
May he feel the same humiliation.

236
01:26:07,200 --> 01:26:09,077
Have him undress!

237
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:00,633
Execute him.

238
01:27:01,760 --> 01:27:03,432
What are you waiting for?

239
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:10,230
Your hand must not tremble.

240
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:22,359
Finish him off.

241
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,550
Did your hand tremble?

242
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,392
No.

243
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,357
Then you are a man, my son.

244
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,628
