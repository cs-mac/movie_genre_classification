1
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:35,783
There.

2
00:03:36,224 --> 00:03:37,987
Technicals, nine o'clock.

3
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,179
Oh, shit! Did you see that?

4
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:09,482
Chief, we got unarmed civilians
getting shot down here at nine o'clock.

5
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:12,853
l got it, Matt.
l don't think we can touch this.

6
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:18,192
This food is the property
of Mohamed Farrah Aidid!

7
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,531
Go back to your homes!

8
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,300
Command, Super 64...

9
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:26,101
...we got militia shooting civilians
at the food distribution center.

10
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,442
Request permission to engage.

11
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,841
Super 64, are you taking fire? Over.

12
00:04:31,412 --> 00:04:32,845
Negative, command.

13
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,609
U.N.'sjurisdiction, 64.
We cannotintervene.

14
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:38,378
-Return to base. Over.
-Roger.

15
00:04:38,986 --> 00:04:40,715
64 returning.

16
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:30,264
Ready, Mr. Atto.

17
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:42,580
Leaving.

18
00:06:08,175 --> 00:06:09,142
Sir.

19
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:12,573
Keep Driving!

20
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:27,684
I'm going to be late.

21
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:30,129
Call you back.

22
00:06:47,715 --> 00:06:49,444
General Garrison?

23
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:50,882
No, thanks. l got one.

24
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:52,848
But these are Cuban.

25
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:55,087
Bolivar Belicoso.

26
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,512
So is this.

27
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,019
Miami, my friend, is not Cuba.

28
00:07:08,602 --> 00:07:11,571
l see not catching Aidid
is becoming a routine.

29
00:07:12,506 --> 00:07:15,441
We weren't trying to catch Aidid.
We were trying to catch you.

30
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:16,339
Me?

31
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:18,811
But am l that important?

32
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,772
l hardly think so.

33
00:07:20,948 --> 00:07:23,974
-You're just a businessman.
-Trying to make a living.

34
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:26,915
Yeah. Selling guns to Aidid's militia.

35
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:33,449
You've been here, what?

36
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,587
Six weeks?

37
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:41,827
Six weeks
you are trying to catch the general.

38
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:44,531
You put up reward posters.

39
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,305
$25,000. What is this?
Gunfight at the K.O. Corral?

40
00:07:50,544 --> 00:07:53,536
lt's the O.K. Corral.

41
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:58,212
Do you think bringing me in
will make him suddenly come to you?

42
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:00,614
Make him more agreeable?

43
00:08:03,157 --> 00:08:05,182
You know where he sleeps.

44
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:09,285
You pay for his beds, much less his militia.

45
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,159
We're not leaving Somalia till we find him.

46
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,998
And we will find him.

47
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,699
Don't think because l grew up
without running water...

48
00:08:19,774 --> 00:08:21,765
...l am simple, General.

49
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,176
l do know something about history.

50
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:30,183
See all this? lt's simply shaping tomorrow.

51
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:34,811
A tomorrow without a lot
of Arkansas white boys' ideas in it.

52
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:38,390
Well, l wouldn't know about that.
l'm from Texas.

53
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:42,722
Mr. Garrison,
l think you shouldn't have come here.

54
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,230
This is civil war.

55
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,031
This is our war.

56
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,031
Not yours.

57
00:08:51,772 --> 00:08:54,536
300,000 dead and counting.

58
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:58,108
That's not a war, Mr. Atto.
That's genocide.

59
00:08:59,613 --> 00:09:02,207
Now, you enjoy that tea, you hear?

60
00:09:07,888 --> 00:09:09,651
How'd he strike you?

61
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:12,918
Urbane, sophisticated, cruel.

62
00:09:12,993 --> 00:09:14,756
Yeah, he's a good catch.

63
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:17,595
lt'll take time, but Aidid will feel the loss.

64
00:09:17,665 --> 00:09:20,532
l'm not sure time is something we got
in great supply.

65
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,765
This isn't lraq, you know.
Much more complicated than that.

66
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:27,197
Boss, most of Washington might disagree.

67
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:31,438
They've been calling for situation reports
every morning this week.

68
00:09:32,513 --> 00:09:36,847
Well, tell them the situation is fragile.

69
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:46,025
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Cliff ''Elvis'' Wolcott.

70
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:47,854
I'll be yourpilot today.

71
00:09:47,928 --> 00:09:52,024
Federal regulations designate this
a non-smoking Black Hawk helicopter.

72
00:09:52,099 --> 00:09:56,433
Those in Mogadishu frequent flyer program
will earn 100 free credits.

73
00:09:56,637 --> 00:10:01,165
And as always, the air sickness bags
are in the seatback in front of you.

74
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,042
Number one indications are good, Cliff.
Put her on two.

75
00:10:05,346 --> 00:10:06,574
You're still clear.

76
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:25,060
61, this is 64. Go to UHF secure.

77
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:26,459
l've got some bad news.

78
00:10:27,635 --> 00:10:30,365
''Limo'' is a word, Durant.
l don't want to hear about it.

79
00:10:30,638 --> 00:10:33,300
Itis not a word.
It's an abbreviation of a word.

80
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,475
''Limo'' is a word in common usage.

81
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:39,340
That is the key phrase in Scrabble,
my good friend. Common usage.

82
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,505
lf it's not in the dictionary it doesn't count!

83
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,676
It doesn't have to be in the dictionary!

84
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:46,913
It does have to be in the dictionary!

85
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:50,320
When we get back to the base,
it's coming off.

86
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:54,023
You touch my ''limo''
and I'll spank you, Nightstalker.

87
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:56,220
Yeah, promises.

88
00:10:56,964 --> 00:10:58,727
That's a nice beach down there.

89
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,489
How's the water?

90
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:04,869
Yeah, it's nice and warm.
And it's loaded with sharks.

91
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,535
-Name.
-Todd.

92
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:14,676
-Last name.
-Blackburn.

93
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,178
First name, Todd.

94
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:21,318
-So, what's it like?
-What's what like?

95
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:22,750
Mogadishu. The fighting.

96
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,758
-Serial number.
-72163427.

97
00:11:27,962 --> 00:11:31,625
Firstly, it's ''the Mog'' or simply ''Mog.''
No one calls it Mogadishu here.

98
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:35,100
Secondly, l wouldn't know
about the fighting, so don't ask.

99
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:36,692
Why not?

100
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:38,796
Didn't l just say, ''Don't ask''?

101
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:45,006
You look like you're about 12,
so let me explain something to you.

102
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,640
l have a rare and mysterious skill
that precludes me from doing missions.

103
00:11:50,117 --> 00:11:51,084
Typing.

104
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,585
-Can you type?
-No.

105
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,050
-Date of birth.
-2-27-75.

106
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:05,896
Well, l'm here to kick some ass.

107
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:12,171
Let's bring itin.

108
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:29,618
Nice, man! Very smooth!

109
00:12:30,057 --> 00:12:31,888
Single shot through the engine block.

110
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:35,255
Shit, that's a shame. That was a nice jeep.

111
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:01,317
Cease fire! Cease fire!

112
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,013
Check your weapons!

113
00:13:03,257 --> 00:13:04,246
Sergeant Eversmann.

114
00:13:08,629 --> 00:13:10,096
Private First Class Blackburn.

115
00:13:10,431 --> 00:13:11,420
Yeah?

116
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:13,090
Reporting for duty.

117
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:18,101
Not to me. You're reporting to Lt. Beales.
He should be here somewhere.

118
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:19,398
Can l leave him with you?

119
00:13:20,441 --> 00:13:22,432
Yeah, go ahead.

120
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,710
-You brought your weapon.
-Yes, sir.

121
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:26,842
Want me to shoot? l'm rested.

122
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,082
-When did you get in?
-Just now, Sergeant.

123
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:36,114
Hey, who's hungry?

124
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,978
What is this, Sarg'nt?
Another taxpayer-funded Delta safari?

125
00:14:02,249 --> 00:14:05,241
-Not if General Garrison is asking.
-l'm asking.

126
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,644
Have a nice meal, Captain.

127
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,757
-Hey, man, there's a line.
-l know.

128
00:14:15,195 --> 00:14:18,596
-Well, this isn't the back of it.
-Yeah, l know.

129
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:22,128
Sergeant. Sergeant.

130
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:24,030
What's going on here?

131
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:27,130
Some aerial target practice, sir.
Didn't want to leave it behind.

132
00:14:27,207 --> 00:14:29,368
l'm talking about your weapon.

133
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:32,070
Delta or no Delta, that's a hot weapon.

134
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,545
You know better than that.
Safety should be on at all times on base.

135
00:14:35,616 --> 00:14:37,982
Well, this is my safety, sir.

136
00:14:40,788 --> 00:14:43,757
Let it go, sir.
The guy hasn't eaten in a couple of days.

137
00:14:43,824 --> 00:14:46,657
You Delta boys
are a bunch of undisciplined cowboys.

138
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,359
Let me tell you something, Sarg'nt.

139
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:53,329
When we get on a five-yard line,
you're going to need my Rangers.

140
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,459
Y'all better learn to be team players.

141
00:14:57,237 --> 00:14:58,727
We're done here.

142
00:15:08,348 --> 00:15:11,840
Speak up. You say this is your safety?

143
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,850
Well, this is my boot, son.

144
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:18,122
And it will fit up your ass
with the proper amount of force.

145
00:15:18,325 --> 00:15:21,954
-ls that a Jersey accent?
-l'm trying to do this, give me a break.

146
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:24,027
Take those sunglasses off.

147
00:15:24,164 --> 00:15:26,496
Delta wants to wear Oakleys,
that's their business.

148
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,797
l don't want to see them on you again.

149
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,266
Is that a hot weapon?

150
00:15:37,611 --> 00:15:38,976
ls that your move?

151
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:41,011
ls my hand on the piece?

152
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:43,815
l can mate you in three whatever you do.

153
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:48,584
l'd keep my eye on that queen
before counseling others.

154
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:51,191
Well, she's just lying in wait.

155
00:15:55,095 --> 00:15:56,084
Yikes.

156
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,324
lt's good. You're really improving.

157
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,429
lf l may make a suggestion-- Observation.

158
00:16:04,638 --> 00:16:05,627
Go ahead.

159
00:16:05,873 --> 00:16:08,205
-lt's a children's book, right?
-Right.

160
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:12,939
They are not supposed to scare
the living shit out of the children.

161
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,846
This is the part of the story
where our knight is slaying the dragon.

162
00:16:16,917 --> 00:16:19,579
That's scary.
Besides, my daughter loves this stuff.

163
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:21,644
Thought you finished that last week.

164
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:23,551
You done?

165
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:28,617
Hey, we are at the 10-yard line here, men.

166
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:30,285
You understand?

167
00:16:30,797 --> 00:16:33,288
Can you count? One, two, ten.

168
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,961
Okay? Where are my running backs?

169
00:16:36,169 --> 00:16:37,966
Where are my running backs?

170
00:16:39,473 --> 00:16:42,601
Hey, l didn't see you at church on Sunday.

171
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:44,743
You had something more important to do?

172
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:47,379
Not on Sunday, you don't. Not anymore.

173
00:16:47,447 --> 00:16:49,745
l will make you believe, you understand?

174
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:06,397
Pretty funny, hoo-ah?

175
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:12,963
lt was a good impression.
l recognize myself.

176
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,239
All right, carry on.

177
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,778
-l'd like a word, specialist.
-Sir.

178
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:24,940
You understand why we have
a chain of command, don't you?

179
00:17:25,118 --> 00:17:26,016
Roger that, sir.

180
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,578
lf you ever undermine me again,
you'll clean latrines with your tongue...

181
00:17:29,656 --> 00:17:32,682
...till you taste no difference
between shit and French fries.

182
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:33,885
-Are we clear?
-Hoo-ah, sir.

183
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:34,893
All right.

184
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:43,793
Listen to this:

185
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,637
lf one skinny kills another his clan owes
the dead guy's clan a hundred camels.

186
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:50,170
A hundred camels.

187
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,640
Camels. l wouldn't pay one camel.

188
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,080
Must be a lot of fucking camel debt.

189
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,781
ls that really true, Lieutenant?

190
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:00,010
Ask Sgt. Eversmann. He likes skinnies.

191
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,082
Sgt. Eversmann,
you really like the skinnies?

192
00:18:03,523 --> 00:18:07,254
lt's not that l like them or l don't like them.
l respect them.

193
00:18:07,427 --> 00:18:11,591
See, what you guys fail to realize
is the sergeant is a bit of an idealist.

194
00:18:12,232 --> 00:18:15,633
He believes in this mission
down to his bones. Don't you, Sergeant?

195
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,134
Look, these people, they have no jobs...

196
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:23,469
...no food, no education, no future.

197
00:18:23,543 --> 00:18:27,138
l just figure that, l mean,
we have two things that we can do.

198
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,738
We can help...

199
00:18:28,815 --> 00:18:32,251
...or we can sit back and watch
the country destroy itself on CNN.

200
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,308
Right?

201
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,623
l don't know about you guys,
but l was trained to fight.

202
00:18:36,823 --> 00:18:38,882
Are you trained to fight, Sergeant?

203
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:41,757
Well, l think l was trained
to make a difference, Kurth.

204
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,295
Like the man said, he's an idealist.

205
00:18:47,067 --> 00:18:49,126
Oh, wait. This is my favorite part.

206
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,540
Stay away from the cans!

207
00:18:56,777 --> 00:18:59,143
Die, gas-pumper!

208
00:18:59,813 --> 00:19:01,610
Stay away from those cans!

209
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,647
No, no, stay back.

210
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:11,714
He's having a seizure.
Put something in his mouth.

211
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:16,729
John, it's okay. John, it's okay. lt's okay.

212
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:05,943
Well, he'll be fine. But not in this army.

213
00:20:06,947 --> 00:20:09,609
He's out of the game.
He's epileptic, going home.

214
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:16,749
l'm putting you in charge of his chalk.

215
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:20,023
-You got a problem with that?
-No, sir.

216
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,186
lt's a big responsibility.

217
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:24,822
Your men will look to you
to make the right decisions.

218
00:20:24,898 --> 00:20:26,957
Their lives depend on it.

219
00:20:28,034 --> 00:20:29,262
All right.

220
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,905
-Rangers lead the way, sir.
-All the way.

221
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,539
Good luck.

222
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:22,851
A meeting ofAidid's senior cabinet
may take place today at 1500 hours.

223
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,420
l say ''may'' because we all know by now...

224
00:21:26,626 --> 00:21:29,891
...with the intel we get on the street,
nothing is certain.

225
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:32,929
This is actual intel
confirmed by three sources.

226
00:21:33,767 --> 00:21:36,827
Two tier-one personalities may be present:

227
00:21:37,304 --> 00:21:41,331
Omar Salad, Aidid's top political advisor...

228
00:21:41,408 --> 00:21:44,002
...and Abdi Hassan Awale, interior minister.

229
00:21:44,077 --> 00:21:46,068
These are the guys we're after.

230
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:48,312
Today we go.

231
00:21:48,882 --> 00:21:51,373
Same mission template as before.

232
00:21:51,618 --> 00:21:55,714
1545, Assault Force Delta
will infiltrate the target building...

233
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,117
...and seize all suspects within.

234
00:21:58,325 --> 00:22:02,227
Security Force Rangers: 4 Ranger chalks,
under command of Capt. Steele...

235
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:04,559
...will rope in at 1546...

236
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:08,065
...and hold a four-corner perimeter
around the target building.

237
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:09,933
No one gets in or out.

238
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,727
Extraction Force:

239
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:16,566
Lt. Colonel McKnight's humvee column
will drive in at 1547...

240
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:20,712
...on Hawlwadig Road
and hold just short of the Olympic Hotel.

241
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:22,381
Wait for the green light.

242
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,447
Now once Delta gives the word...

243
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:29,383
...McKnight's column will go to the target
and load the prisoners onto trucks.

244
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:32,356
lmmediately after
the prisoners are loaded...

245
00:22:32,525 --> 00:22:36,621
...the four Ranger chalks
will collapse back to the target building...

246
00:22:36,863 --> 00:22:38,228
...load up on humvees...

247
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:42,299
...and the entire ground force
will exfil the 3 miles back to base.

248
00:22:42,602 --> 00:22:45,833
Mission time, no longer than 30 minutes.

249
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:51,775
Now, l had requested light armor
and AC-130 Spectre gunships...

250
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:56,039
...but Washington, in all its wisdom,
decided against this.

251
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:58,080
Too high-profile.

252
00:22:58,318 --> 00:23:01,481
So Black Hawks and Little Birds
will provide the air cover...

253
00:23:01,721 --> 00:23:03,916
...with miniguns and 2.75 rockets.

254
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:05,522
Colonel Harrell.

255
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:10,059
ln the C-2 bird, Colonel Matthews
will coordinate the air mission...

256
00:23:10,563 --> 00:23:13,396
...and l will coordinate ground forces.

257
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,030
Colonel Matthews.

258
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:18,400
Mission launch code word is lrene.

259
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:19,861
Questions?

260
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,440
Which building is it, sir?

261
00:23:24,978 --> 00:23:28,573
We're confirming that now.
Somewhere near the Bakara market.

262
00:23:31,217 --> 00:23:34,209
l don't choose the time or place
of their meetings.

263
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:36,184
l didn't say a word, sir.

264
00:23:36,489 --> 00:23:39,890
Make no mistake,
once you're in the Bakara market...

265
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,360
...you're in an entirely hostile district.

266
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:45,262
Don't underestimate their capabilities.

267
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:49,093
We'll be in friendly neighborhoods
before we hit the market...

268
00:23:49,235 --> 00:23:53,934
...so remember the rules of engagement:
No one fires unless fired upon.

269
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:56,371
Now, let's go get this thing done.

270
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,104
Good luck, gentlemen.

271
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,985
What's the matter, Danny?
Something you don't like?

272
00:24:07,187 --> 00:24:09,382
No Spectre gunships,
daylight instead of night...

273
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:12,047
...afternoon when they're all fucked up
on khat...

274
00:24:12,225 --> 00:24:16,389
...only part of the city Aidid can mount
a counter-attack on short notice....

275
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:19,664
-What's not to like?
-Life's imperfect.

276
00:24:19,866 --> 00:24:23,597
For you two, circling above it at 500 feet,
it's imperfect.

277
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:27,500
Down in the street, it's unforgiving.

278
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:04,973
What the fuck, Smith?

279
00:25:05,945 --> 00:25:07,845
-Well?
-Well, what?

280
00:25:08,014 --> 00:25:09,481
We going?

281
00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:14,616
-Why should l tell you that?
-Because l'm me.

282
00:25:15,955 --> 00:25:19,652
Yeah. 3:00. Downtown.

283
00:25:19,859 --> 00:25:21,383
-Bakara market.
-All right.

284
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:25,462
Listen, Smith, l need you to back me up
out there today, all right?

285
00:25:25,665 --> 00:25:26,859
Keep sharp.

286
00:25:29,536 --> 00:25:31,663
Yes, sir, Sergeant Eversmann.

287
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:34,237
Ev, it's going to be nothing, man.

288
00:25:34,874 --> 00:25:36,171
Nothing.

289
00:25:39,045 --> 00:25:44,381
lt's all in the grind, Sizemore.
Can't be too fine, can't be too coarse.

290
00:25:44,984 --> 00:25:47,179
This, my friend, is a science.

291
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:50,887
You're looking at the guy
that believed the commercials.

292
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,218
About ''be all you can be.''

293
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:56,224
l made coffee through Desert Storm.

294
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:59,726
l made coffee through Panama,
while everyone else got to fight...

295
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,764
...got to be a Ranger.

296
00:26:02,469 --> 00:26:07,304
Now it's ''Grimesy, black, one sugar''
or ''Grimesy, got a powdered anywhere?''

297
00:26:11,177 --> 00:26:13,668
-What happened to you?
-Ping-Pong accident.

298
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:15,036
What?

299
00:26:16,015 --> 00:26:17,380
So guess what.

300
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,782
Your wish has been granted.
You're going out today.

301
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:22,614
You're fucking me.

302
00:26:22,856 --> 00:26:25,324
You're taking my place
assisting the 60 gunner.

303
00:26:25,525 --> 00:26:28,688
Sergeant Eversmann said
to get your stuff and get ready.

304
00:26:29,863 --> 00:26:31,831
lt's what you wanted, isn't it?

305
00:26:31,998 --> 00:26:33,329
Oh, yeah.

306
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,193
Hell, yeah.

307
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:40,065
Grimesy, stick with Waddell
and give him ammo when he needs it.

308
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,437
-Hoo-ah?
-Hoo-ah.

309
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:46,035
l wouldn't worry about that. Generally
speaking, Somalis can't shoot for shit.

310
00:26:46,246 --> 00:26:50,182
Just watch out for the sammys
throwing the rocks, and you'll be fine.

311
00:26:50,383 --> 00:26:51,509
Might even be fun.

312
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:55,486
D-boys do their thing now.
All we got to do is cover them.

313
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:58,456
Choppers going to cover us,
and we'll be all right.

314
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:03,193
Look, you guys,
this is my first time as chalk leader...

315
00:27:03,429 --> 00:27:06,830
...but, this isn't our first time out together.
This is serious.

316
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,436
We're Rangers, not some sorry-ass JROTC.

317
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,266
We're elite.

318
00:27:12,972 --> 00:27:15,099
Let's act like it out there. Hoo-ah?

319
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:17,937
Any questions?

320
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,011
We're going to be okay.

321
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,684
Grab your gear. Let's move out.

322
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:53,035
You're not going to need that, dude.
We're not out there long enough.

323
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,419
You won't need that, either.

324
00:28:02,956 --> 00:28:04,856
We'll be back before dark.

325
00:28:05,091 --> 00:28:07,651
You might as well take dope
and beer instead.

326
00:28:07,827 --> 00:28:09,124
What?

327
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,263
Ammo, dude. Take ammo.

328
00:28:18,805 --> 00:28:22,172
Let me tell you something, Grimes.
You got 50 pounds of gear.

329
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,467
You don't need another 12.

330
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:28,047
l don't know about you,
l don't plan on getting shot running away.

331
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:29,638
Well, l better keep mine in.

332
00:28:29,849 --> 00:28:30,713
Grimes.

333
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,975
Most important thing:

334
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:36,384
Remember, when everyone is shooting,
shoot in the same direction.

335
00:28:44,664 --> 00:28:48,361
Look at this.
He's taping his blood type to his boots.

336
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:52,061
-That's bad luck.
-No, it's smart.

337
00:28:52,372 --> 00:28:54,169
All Delta do that.

338
00:28:54,974 --> 00:28:56,965
That's bad luck too, man.

339
00:28:57,477 --> 00:28:58,603
Come on, let's go.

340
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:05,014
lt's a good thing
you're right-handed, Adonis.

341
00:29:07,153 --> 00:29:11,351
-lf not, l don't know what you'd do.
-You're a funny guy, man.

342
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:15,790
-l'm not taking no death letter.
-We have a deal.

343
00:29:18,598 --> 00:29:20,589
l'll give it to you back in an hour.

344
00:29:20,833 --> 00:29:25,031
-Blackburn, you okay?
-Excited.

345
00:29:26,506 --> 00:29:29,998
ln a good way.
l've been training my whole life for this.

346
00:29:30,376 --> 00:29:32,401
You ever shot at anybody before?

347
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,968
No, sir.

348
00:29:35,581 --> 00:29:36,809
Me neither.

349
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,517
Think he's reliable?

350
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:16,112
Well, we'll see. lt's his first time out.

351
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,665
-Tell him to turn his damn radio off.
-Yes, sir.

352
00:30:26,733 --> 00:30:28,564
Tell him to turn his radio off.

353
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:31,626
Abdi, you need to turn your radio off.

354
00:30:37,944 --> 00:30:42,608
Hi. You've reached Stephanie and Randy,
leave us a message. Thank you.

355
00:30:44,951 --> 00:30:47,385
Hey, baby, it's me. Are you there?

356
00:30:48,955 --> 00:30:50,946
Pick up ifyou're there.

357
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:54,793
l'm just calling
to make sure everything's all right.

358
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,829
l'll call you in a couple hours.

359
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,798
You'd better not be sleeping.

360
00:31:01,801 --> 00:31:03,098
Your move, Randy.

361
00:31:04,837 --> 00:31:06,361
I'm missing you.

362
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,170
l love you, baby.

363
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:11,941
Hello? Hello?

364
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,408
Thanks, bud.

365
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,684
You know, it's kind of funny.

366
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:23,414
Beautiful beach, beautiful sun.

367
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:27,055
Could almost be a good place to visit.

368
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:28,592
Almost.

369
00:31:32,198 --> 00:31:34,325
You don't think we should be here.

370
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:39,728
You know what l think?
lt don't really matter what l think.

371
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:45,442
Once that first bullet goes past your head,
politics and all that shit...

372
00:31:45,611 --> 00:31:47,738
...just goes right out the window.

373
00:31:48,381 --> 00:31:50,542
l just want to do it right today.

374
00:31:51,184 --> 00:31:55,018
Just watch your corner.
Get all your men back here alive.

375
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:24,080
Now, is this supposed to be the place,
or did his car just take a dump?

376
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,716
Abdi, come in.

377
00:32:26,219 --> 00:32:28,687
Abdi, can you hear me? ls this the place?

378
00:32:33,025 --> 00:32:34,219
Abdi, come in.

379
00:32:39,532 --> 00:32:42,126
Can you hear me? Abdi.

380
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:45,894
Abdi, come in. Is this the place?

381
00:32:46,105 --> 00:32:48,573
To my right side, above the cafe.

382
00:32:48,941 --> 00:32:51,205
He says this is the building.

383
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:52,877
He's certain?

384
00:32:53,479 --> 00:32:55,310
Abdi, you need to be sure.

385
00:32:55,548 --> 00:32:56,913
Are you sure?

386
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:02,918
Well, it's down the road,
two blocks over on my left.

387
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,756
But there's too many militia.

388
00:33:06,325 --> 00:33:08,657
If I go closer, they mightshoot me.

389
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:12,156
Now he's saying the building's
a couple blocks down...

390
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,731
...but if he's seen outside it, he'll be shot.

391
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,696
l'll fucking shoot him myself.

392
00:33:17,904 --> 00:33:21,431
Tell him l want his skinny ass
parked in front of the building.

393
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:24,670
He's not getting paid
till he does exactly that.

394
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:28,074
Three miles to the target.
We're never off the main roads.

395
00:33:28,147 --> 00:33:31,344
At K-four traffic circle, we turn north,
then east on National...

396
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:34,614
...and we wait until extraction of prisoners
is complete here.

397
00:33:34,687 --> 00:33:36,655
Then we roll up in force on Hawlwadig...

398
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:40,249
...load the prisoners, the assault-blocking
forces and bring them back.

399
00:33:40,993 --> 00:33:43,154
Home in an hour. Okay?

400
00:33:43,362 --> 00:33:46,661
There will be some shooting.
Bakara market is the Wild West.

401
00:33:46,732 --> 00:33:49,997
But be careful what you shoot at.
People do live there.

402
00:33:50,603 --> 00:33:51,865
Hoo-ah.

403
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:08,014
Last one of these guys shot himself
in the head playing Russian roulette.

404
00:34:21,701 --> 00:34:23,999
Sir, the vehicle is stopped.

405
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:28,205
So this is the real deal now.
He's sure this time.

406
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:33,304
-He sounds scared shitless.
-Good. That's always a good sign.

407
00:34:44,724 --> 00:34:46,885
That's it. That's oursignal.

408
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,390
All right.

409
00:34:48,894 --> 00:34:51,658
All QRF out of the airspace.

410
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:55,192
All QRF out of the airspace.

411
00:35:00,072 --> 00:35:04,532
All units, lrene. l say again, lrene.

412
00:35:12,084 --> 00:35:16,646
Check in when ready. Barber 51 up
and ready. Star 41 up and ready.

413
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:18,116
lrene!

414
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:20,258
Copy, Irene.

415
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:22,424
Fucking lrene!

416
00:35:36,308 --> 00:35:37,138
Come on.

417
00:35:43,883 --> 00:35:45,043
Good luck, boys.

418
00:35:45,117 --> 00:35:46,550
Be careful.

419
00:35:46,952 --> 00:35:49,045
No one gets left behind.

420
00:35:50,956 --> 00:35:52,287
What's wrong?

421
00:35:53,125 --> 00:35:56,288
Nothing. He's just never done that before.

422
00:35:57,296 --> 00:35:58,763
Aw, fuck!

423
00:36:02,902 --> 00:36:04,062
Let's go.

424
00:36:05,071 --> 00:36:07,835
Sergeant Struecker. Let's roll.

425
00:38:47,032 --> 00:38:48,363
Two minutes.

426
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:50,968
Two minutes.

427
00:39:36,115 --> 00:39:38,709
Why are they burning tires?

428
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,851
Signals to the militia that we're coming!

429
00:39:44,023 --> 00:39:47,356
Okay, 56, looks like there's some friendlies
on the ground.

430
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:50,485
Looks like I've got a tally on the voice.

431
00:39:57,002 --> 00:39:58,299
One minute.

432
00:39:59,672 --> 00:40:00,900
One minute.

433
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:06,642
What's that for?

434
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,916
Last rope, l almost bit my tongue off.

435
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:43,813
Touching base.

436
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,280
Two feet, one foot...

437
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,387
...clear.

438
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,484
Little birds touching down at target.

439
00:41:41,073 --> 00:41:42,131
Ropes!

440
00:41:43,409 --> 00:41:45,900
Go! Go! Go!

441
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:56,614
Chalk One troops are on the deck.
Chalk Two deployed.

442
00:41:56,789 --> 00:42:00,122
This is McKnight.
Uniform 64 approaching staging area.

443
00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:13,428
Down! Get down!

444
00:42:13,672 --> 00:42:15,401
Down! Stay down!

445
00:42:15,607 --> 00:42:17,336
Get down! Everybody down!

446
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,842
You, down!

447
00:42:19,044 --> 00:42:20,068
Get down!

448
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:21,169
On the floor.

449
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:28,952
Let's go, let's go!

450
00:42:30,355 --> 00:42:32,721
Grimesy! No fear!

451
00:42:32,958 --> 00:42:34,789
Oh, yeah, right!

452
00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:41,363
Rangers securing perimeter. Four corners.

453
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,294
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

454
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,961
Colonel, they're shooting at us!

455
00:42:47,039 --> 00:42:48,370
Well, shoot back!

456
00:42:52,177 --> 00:42:55,271
This is 64. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

457
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:58,145
This is 62, delivered chalks.
Going to coverpattern.

458
00:42:58,217 --> 00:43:02,313
Super 62, take up an overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

459
00:43:02,488 --> 00:43:05,889
This is Super 65. Chalks on the ground,
going into holding pattern.

460
00:43:12,064 --> 00:43:15,192
Go, Blackburn, go! Go!

461
00:43:15,534 --> 00:43:16,796
Go, Blackburn!

462
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:20,498
RPG!

463
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:22,173
Hold on!

464
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,338
No!

465
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:38,847
C-2, we got a man fallen.

466
00:43:39,458 --> 00:43:41,949
Super-61, you're a sitting duck.

467
00:43:42,361 --> 00:43:45,558
Take up overhead pattern
to provide sniper cover. Over.

468
00:43:45,797 --> 00:43:48,061
Roger that. 61 coming out.

469
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:53,635
13, go ahead. I need you to move to
the north of the street.

470
00:43:53,872 --> 00:43:56,466
Right to the north. Right there. Over.

471
00:43:57,776 --> 00:43:59,539
Doc! Doc Schmid!

472
00:43:59,945 --> 00:44:01,310
Come on!

473
00:44:01,547 --> 00:44:04,072
Schmid, we got a man hit.

474
00:44:06,051 --> 00:44:08,986
-Where's he hit?
-He's not. He fell.

475
00:44:09,054 --> 00:44:11,022
-What?
-He fell.

476
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:16,056
Why aren't you shooting?

477
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,092
We're not being shot at yet!

478
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:19,729
How can you tell?

479
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:21,490
A hiss means it's close.

480
00:44:21,567 --> 00:44:23,000
A snap means--

481
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:25,032
Now they're shooting at us!

482
00:44:33,779 --> 00:44:35,007
Galentine!

483
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,444
Get me Captain Steele!
Get me Captain Steele!

484
00:44:41,853 --> 00:44:45,152
Juliet 64, this is Juliet 25. Come in. Over.

485
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:47,121
Blackburn, can you hear me?

486
00:44:47,326 --> 00:44:50,454
Juliet 64, this is 25. Come in. Over.

487
00:44:50,762 --> 00:44:52,195
l can't get him!

488
00:44:53,198 --> 00:44:56,690
Juliet 64, this is Chalk Four!
We've got a man down!

489
00:44:56,802 --> 00:44:58,793
We need to get him out of here! Over.

490
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,964
This is 64. Say again, 25. Over.

491
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,232
We've got a man down! Over.

492
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:10,009
Take a breath, 25, and calm down. Over.

493
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:13,178
-Man down!
-Missed that, 25.

494
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,083
-Fuck it.
-Say again.

495
00:45:15,153 --> 00:45:17,383
Matt, it's a long way to the humvees!

496
00:45:17,456 --> 00:45:20,857
We'll get a stretcher in here.
Get him to the target building.

497
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,458
What did he say?

498
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:26,495
Super 61,
we got a man wounded on the ground.

499
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:30,267
-Stretcher!
-Get me a stretcher!

500
00:45:30,502 --> 00:45:32,333
Come on. Stretcher.

501
00:45:32,504 --> 00:45:33,869
Come on, come on!

502
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,331
Grab this end!

503
00:45:37,709 --> 00:45:39,336
Let's go!

504
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:42,146
-All right.
-Go.

505
00:45:42,447 --> 00:45:44,915
Get him to the humvees.
We'll hold down the corner.

506
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:46,780
Up to the humvees! Now!

507
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:52,516
Go! Go!

508
00:45:54,393 --> 00:45:56,520
Keep moving, Grimes! Run!

509
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:03,061
-Secure!

-Grimes, run!
-All right.

514
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:21,085
C-2, this is Super 61,
beginning my orbit of the target area.

515
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,585
Chalk Four, clear for a clear. Coming in.

516
00:46:25,857 --> 00:46:29,918
Kilo 11, this is 61,

517
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:31,857
Kilo 64, green light.

00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:35,496
-Ready for extraction. Over.
-Roger that. Will relay.

-Let's move out!
-Hold on.

523
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:11,361
-How much longer?
-Five minutes, sir.

524
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,028
-What?
-Five minutes.

525
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:14,732
Nothing takes five minutes!

526
00:47:20,245 --> 00:47:21,678
What happened to him?

527
00:47:21,747 --> 00:47:25,080
-He fell! Missed the rope!
-How'd he do that?

528
00:47:25,917 --> 00:47:29,080
Put him in that humvee!
Grimes, give him a hand!

529
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:31,421
Let's go! Let's move it!

530
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,751
Move, move! Come on! Move!

531
00:47:35,927 --> 00:47:37,292
Get him in there!

532
00:47:37,362 --> 00:47:38,852
Get ready to move!

533
00:47:39,431 --> 00:47:41,422
Go! Everybody move! Move!

534
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,063
Get the fuck up!

535
00:47:44,603 --> 00:47:46,628
Grimes! Come on!

536
00:47:47,539 --> 00:47:49,200
Grimes! Grimes!

537
00:47:57,115 --> 00:47:58,878
Fuck this!

538
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:23,233
Fuck!

539
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:30,141
Let's go.

540
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:31,943
Come on!

541
00:48:32,751 --> 00:48:34,184
Go! Move it!

542
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:35,408
Move!

543
00:48:35,587 --> 00:48:38,784
Romeo 64, l need to send out
three humvees with a casualty.

544
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:40,916
He looks real bad. l need to evac now.

545
00:48:41,092 --> 00:48:42,457
Roger that, Uniform 64.

546
00:48:42,694 --> 00:48:45,219
We'll chop a team of gun ships to you.
Over.

547
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,855
Roger that.

548
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,529
l need extra security on these humvees!

549
00:48:49,601 --> 00:48:52,695
l'll go. l'll take my team,
make sure they get back okay.

550
00:48:52,771 --> 00:48:53,795
Do it.

551
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:56,098
Struecker, you're lead humvee.

552
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,377
First three vehicles mount up,
we're moving back to base.

553
00:49:05,717 --> 00:49:06,979
Move out!

554
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,827
How are things going?
Things okay there, Struecker?

555
00:49:26,905 --> 00:49:29,169
l don't want to talk about it now, Colonel!

556
00:49:29,241 --> 00:49:30,606
I'm busy.

557
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:00,796
Sergeant Pilla's hit!

558
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:03,773
Christ, he's fucked up!

559
00:50:03,942 --> 00:50:05,307
Is anyone hit?

560
00:50:05,777 --> 00:50:07,210
Struecker, talk to me!

561
00:50:07,279 --> 00:50:08,974
lt's Sergeant Pilla!

562
00:50:09,447 --> 00:50:10,971
What's his status?

563
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,349
What's his status?

564
00:50:13,985 --> 00:50:15,282
He's dead.

565
00:50:16,321 --> 00:50:17,618
He's dead.

566
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,279
Pilla's dead, sir.

567
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:26,563
C-2, this is McKnight.
We have a KIA Dominick Pilla. Over.

568
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,555
Roger that.

569
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,225
Get on that 50!

570
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,664
Someone get on that 50!

571
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,304
lt's mine.

572
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,885
Three guys with RPGs,
coming up on your side now!

573
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,495
Stay with it!

574
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,162
This is 61. I'm hit. I'm hit.

575
00:51:37,836 --> 00:51:42,136
Super 61 is hit. He is hit.
Wolcott's bird is hit.

576
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,969
You want to pull those PCLs off-line
or what?

577
00:51:47,178 --> 00:51:48,475
Right, babe.

578
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,470
Come on.

579
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,820
61, going down.

580
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:00,252
61 going down.

581
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,759
61 is going down.

582
00:52:04,195 --> 00:52:06,527
Super 61 is going down.

583
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:09,033
Super 61 is going down.

584
00:52:09,267 --> 00:52:12,100
61 is going down.
I repeat, it's going down.

585
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,067
61's going down.

586
00:52:16,441 --> 00:52:17,965
Hold on!

587
00:52:40,598 --> 00:52:43,465
We got a Black Hawk down.
We got a Black Hawk down.

588
00:52:44,803 --> 00:52:47,966
Super 61 is down.
We got a bird down in the city.

589
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:50,141
Super 61 is on the deck now.

590
00:52:51,142 --> 00:52:53,736
Get an MH-six on site. Check for survivors.

591
00:52:53,978 --> 00:52:55,809
Send in the SAR bird.

592
00:52:56,014 --> 00:52:59,780
l want ground forces to move and secure
a new perimeter around that crash site.

593
00:52:59,851 --> 00:53:01,910
Can you guide the convoy in there?

594
00:53:01,986 --> 00:53:03,112
Roger that.

595
00:53:03,188 --> 00:53:04,519
Well, move quick.

596
00:53:05,623 --> 00:53:08,091
The whole city
will be coming down on top of them.

597
00:53:08,927 --> 00:53:12,761
Star 41, come inbound
and see if you can land at the crash site.

598
00:53:12,964 --> 00:53:15,296
Roger that. Star 41 inbound.

599
00:53:27,312 --> 00:53:29,109
We just lost the initiative.

600
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:37,320
25, this is 64. Over.

601
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:39,321
25. Over.

602
00:53:39,958 --> 00:53:43,223
25, Chalk Four is closest to the crash site.
Over.

603
00:53:43,461 --> 00:53:45,952
64, l can't see the crash site. Over.

604
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:49,460
25, it's due east of you. You will find it.

605
00:53:49,634 --> 00:53:53,434
Leave a security element in place.
Take the rest of your chalk to the crash.

606
00:53:53,505 --> 00:53:56,872
Check for survivors. Secure the area.
All other chalks will follow.

607
00:53:59,477 --> 00:54:01,570
25, do you read me? Over.

608
00:54:02,247 --> 00:54:04,579

Get Twombly.

611
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,917
Hey, there's a Black Hawk down.

612
00:54:10,088 --> 00:54:11,885
Twombly, Nelson, stay here.

613
00:54:12,023 --> 00:54:14,924
Hold this corner
and then exfil with the humvees.

614
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:18,960
Galentine, Schmid, you're coming with me.
Let's go.

615
00:54:19,464 --> 00:54:21,557
How come l got to stay back here?

616
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:23,428
Because you're dependable.

617
00:54:24,602 --> 00:54:25,864
All right...

618
00:54:27,572 --> 00:54:28,903
...let's go!

619
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,045
l hate being dependable, man.

620
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:54,022
Juliet 25, hostiles advancing,
parallel west to yourposition.

621
00:54:54,132 --> 00:54:56,396
Women and children among them. Over.

622
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,729
Hit the wall.

624
00:55:21,426 --> 00:55:22,859

Go.

626
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:52,982
We still got guys inside!

627
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:54,783
l'll go to the crash.

628

You take the rest of the team.
l'll finish loading the prisoners.

629
00:55:58,963 --> 00:56:01,295
No! We'll go to the crash site together.

630
00:56:01,366 --> 00:56:03,596
Secure the perimeter,
wait for the humvees.

631
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:05,499
-Roger that.
-Follow my lead.

632
00:56:06,070 --> 00:56:08,163
Sarg'nt, are you receiving me?

633
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:10,901
Yeah, l heard you.
We should be leaving soon.

634
00:56:12,777 --> 00:56:15,575
All right, we need to move out now!

635
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:18,878
l'll finish loading the prisoners
and pick you up at the crash site!

636
00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:20,178
Let's move out!

637
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,650
Moving out! Go!

638
00:56:28,793 --> 00:56:30,761
Get in! Get in!

639
00:56:30,962 --> 00:56:32,224
Move!

640
00:56:45,677 --> 00:56:47,201
Eight o'clock!

641
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:03,490
Grimes, stay away from the walls.

642
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:20,741
Grimes. You okay?

643
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,341
Yeah!

644
00:57:24,415 --> 00:57:25,780
Let's go, Maddox.

645
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:28,582
-C-2, convoy's moving out.
-Roger that.

646
00:57:28,753 --> 00:57:31,381
Maddox, look at these jerks! These idiots!

647
00:57:31,622 --> 00:57:34,182
Go, go! Right, Maddox, right!

648
00:57:43,768 --> 00:57:46,259
Twombly, the convoy is leaving!

649
00:57:46,637 --> 00:57:48,434
Hey, Twombly!

650
00:57:49,273 --> 00:57:50,262
What?

651
00:57:50,475 --> 00:57:52,966
-l think they've forgotten us.
-What?

652
00:57:53,177 --> 00:57:54,667
lt doesn't matter.

653
00:58:02,387 --> 00:58:07,154
63 confirm. Skinnies are moving in
on all sides. They need help now.

654
00:58:08,459 --> 00:58:12,225
Indigenous personnel
advancing to Wolcott crash site.

655
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,893
Say again. Over.

656
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:17,264
A lot ofpeople closing in.

657
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:22,164
How far is Chalk Four from the crash site?

658
00:58:22,407 --> 00:58:25,501
-Six blocks, sir.
-They need to haul ass.

659
00:59:19,263 --> 00:59:21,231
Get down! Get down!

660
00:59:22,333 --> 00:59:24,028
Scotty, are you okay?

661
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:27,537
No, don't go back!

662
00:59:37,281 --> 00:59:39,306
Get down! Get down!

663
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:43,016
Technicals!

664
00:59:43,354 --> 00:59:44,844
Got them!

665
00:59:52,063 --> 00:59:53,860
Six o'clock! Move, move!

666
01:00:15,887 --> 01:00:17,878
Go, go, go!

667
01:00:23,461 --> 01:00:24,655
Go, go!

668
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,466
Come on!

669
01:00:37,975 --> 01:00:39,670
Yurek, leaving!

670
01:00:42,647 --> 01:00:43,807
Come on!

671
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,898
Uniform 64, left turn. Left turn.

672
01:02:15,439 --> 01:02:19,466
Romeo 64, l need to know before l get to
the goddamn street!

673
01:02:19,677 --> 01:02:22,271
You have to slow down. There's a delay.

674
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,076
From the time directions are relayed
from surveillance to JOC, then to me.

675
01:02:27,351 --> 01:02:30,184
We can't slow down!
We're taking heavy enemy fire!

676
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:32,050
We can't slow down!

677
01:02:32,123 --> 01:02:35,991
Danny, I'm getting information
from Orion surveillance above.

678
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:38,923
So get me my fucking directions to
the crash site!

679
01:02:38,996 --> 01:02:43,023
Danny, hold on. I no longer have
the best view ofyour route.

680
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:45,792
Getyour ass in the rightplace,
goddamn it!

681
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,269
What in the hell is the status
of Struecker's humvees?

682
01:02:49,373 --> 01:02:52,308
Colonel Harrell, ETA to base,
Struecker's column.

683
01:02:52,476 --> 01:02:55,138
ETA to base momentarily.

684
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:03,419
Open the gate!

685
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,770
-Get him out! Let's go! Let's go!
-Come on.

686
01:03:30,448 --> 01:03:31,881
Watch his head.

687
01:03:31,949 --> 01:03:33,314
Easy.

688
01:03:41,225 --> 01:03:43,989
-Blackburn, can you hear me?
-Get him to a medic.

689
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:22,023
Star 41 is at the crash site
to evacuate the injured. Over.

690
01:04:22,099 --> 01:04:23,191
Roger that.

691
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,360
l got you.

692
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:06,120
Easy.

693
01:05:13,360 --> 01:05:15,200
Galentine, you all right?

694
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:19,120
Galentine, Kurth, with me!
Cover fire, now.

695
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:20,800
Full cover!

696
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,640
How many are in there?

697
01:05:36,720 --> 01:05:39,480
Two pilots are dead,
two crew chiefs are wounded!

698
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,160
-He's hurt bad. We must get out of here.
-All right. Go ahead.

699
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:19,200
26, this is 25.
ls that you shooting up the technicals?

700
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:21,880
This is 26. Roger that.

701
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,040
DiTomasso, take the southeast corner.
We're setting up a perimeter. Over.

702
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,960
This is 26. Roger that. Moving there now.

703
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:30,440
Move out!

704
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:35,600
Captain Steele, come in.

705
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,160
Go ahead, 25. This is 64.

706
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:44,160
We got two wounded and we got both
the pilots dead in the chopper!

707
01:06:44,520 --> 01:06:46,120
We need a medivac now!

708
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:51,920
lt's too hot to land a bird.
You must secure the perimeter first. Over.

709
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,920
Where are the humvees?

710
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Be advised, 25, the convoy will be there.

711
01:06:57,040 --> 01:07:00,160
They're encountering a lot of resistance.
64 out.
