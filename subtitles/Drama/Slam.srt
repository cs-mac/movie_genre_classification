1
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:43,607
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.
Can't nobody get me.

2
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,154
Can't nobody get me.

3
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,700
Can't nobody get me.

4
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:57,551
One, two, three, four, five,

5
00:02:57,657 --> 00:02:59,926
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve...

6
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:01,369
I want chocolate.

7
00:03:01,434 --> 00:03:03,508
You gonna get yours.
Everybody gonna get theirs.

8
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,515
- I want chocolate.
- All right. Here you go.

9
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,013
You got a rhyme or something?

10
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:10,744
I got a rhyme or something.

11
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:12,724
I kick rhymes automatic.

12
00:03:12,798 --> 00:03:14,490
Addicted to changes
like leaves.

13
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,803
My black is gold like bees.

14
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:18,590
So stingray on a sunny day,

15
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,137
while the little kids sit out
and play or converse.

16
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,577
Getting ready for
the ice cream truck...

17
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,340
You wrote somethin'?

18
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:31,267
No, I just know
a little something.

19
00:03:31,334 --> 00:03:34,084
- What you got?
- I got a little something.

20
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,500
My name is little Troy,
and I'm known as a big boy.

21
00:03:37,574 --> 00:03:41,470
I gotta put some more
at the end, though.

22
00:03:41,544 --> 00:03:43,618
I'll help you with it,
if you want.

23
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:49,030
So, yo, what's up with Keisha?

24
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:50,823
Yo, the chick is bugging yo.

25
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:52,997
She keeps hitting on me.

26
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:00,717
I need something to get my head right,
know what I'm saying?

27
00:04:00,784 --> 00:04:01,929
You gonna share
some blessing with me?

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,015
Oh, yeah. I got you.

29
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:06,701
- Please.
- Medicine for you.

30
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:09,487
This is my prescription.

31
00:04:09,553 --> 00:04:11,146
Ah, that's what I'm talkin'.

32
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:14,668
This is that Maui-Waui, right?

33
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,075
This is the truth.
So help you God.

34
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,076
So, uh, after smokin' this,

35
00:04:20,181 --> 00:04:23,029
I'll understand some of that shit you
be talkin' about in your rhymes, right?

36
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,326
Probably not.

37
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,528
- Good luck.
- Peace.

38
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,769
Them brothers is strong.
Them brothers is strong.

39
00:04:38,844 --> 00:04:44,956
- He pulled that trigger, too.
- He didn't pull that trigger.

40
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,453
Ain't nobody comin' up
in Dodge City like that, man.

41
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:49,886
If I have to go through there,
if I have to go through there,

42
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,774
somebody gonna
be like Biggie and Tupac.

43
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:53,750
Look, you handle your business.
Don't let your business handle you.

44
00:04:53,857 --> 00:04:55,483
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,933
- What's up, yo?
- Hey, what's up?

46
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:27,394
- Hey, what's up, man?
- What's going on?

47
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:30,627
So, I got some good things
I'm tryin' to invest in, you know?

48
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:33,287
- I hear. I know.
- I gotta make it big.

49
00:05:33,358 --> 00:05:35,977
- You know I'm writing everyday.
- Everyday. You gotta give me that.

50
00:05:36,047 --> 00:05:38,600
'Cause I'm going with you,
you know what I'm saying?

51
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,687
So, you gonna start the label?

52
00:05:39,792 --> 00:05:41,801
Yeah, I want you to
do that record label.

53
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,532
I got the money invested in it.

54
00:05:43,602 --> 00:05:45,294
Look, I want you to do me a favor.

55
00:05:45,363 --> 00:05:48,081
- What's that?
- I got this new chick, right?

56
00:05:48,148 --> 00:05:52,010
I want you to give me some good
shit to tell her, you know?

57
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:54,290
Slick shit to say to her.
You know what I'm saying?

58
00:05:54,358 --> 00:05:57,774
I'm serious, man.
You got to do that for me, man.

59
00:05:57,847 --> 00:05:59,505
You gotta give me the right
poems and shit.

60
00:05:59,575 --> 00:06:02,544
Man, look, I don't want
to read that junk, you know,

61
00:06:02,617 --> 00:06:04,504
I just want to remember
something.

62
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:05,911
I think if you write it,
you better read that shit.

63
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:09,241
I don't want you to write
no heavy poems and shit.

64
00:06:09,307 --> 00:06:10,681
I ain't gonna be sittin' there
singin' to the bitch.

65
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:13,268
I ain't no R. Kelly.
Know what I'm saying?

66
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,243
I want you to sit there
and give me a little something.

67
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,837
You know what I'm saying?
It's like that.

68
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:20,088
You my man.
You gotta look out for me.

69
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:22,429
- I got ya. Look...
- What's up?

70
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:24,471
Um, I'm runnin' low,
can you look out for me?

71
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:26,781
Yeah. I got that.
I'll look out for you.

72
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,605
But, look, come back later on,

73
00:06:28,705 --> 00:06:30,811
meet me at Dodge City,
around about 1O:3O.

74
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:33,948
- And I got you, okay?
- And I got you then, too.

75
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:36,025
- Bye.
- Okay.

76
00:07:34,424 --> 00:07:36,334
It's gonna be a hot one tonight.
I can feel it.

77
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,351
I'm gettin' too old for this shit.

78
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:42,040
Tell them to get some
additional units because,

79
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:44,343
they been actin' kind of silly,
know what I mean?

80
00:07:44,442 --> 00:07:45,621
These young boys, you know,

81
00:07:45,691 --> 00:07:49,402
that rap music they got
is drivin' 'em crazy.

82
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,680
Come in, EC-1.

83
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,979
Let all units know that...
be heads up.

84
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,257
You got it, EC-1.

85
00:07:57,151 --> 00:07:59,223
You remember that song,
"What's your name?"

86
00:07:59,295 --> 00:08:00,857
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Remember that one?

87
00:08:03,202 --> 00:08:04,959
Why don't you hit it? Hit it.

88
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:08,770
? What's your name??

89
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:12,862
- ? Have I seen you before??
- ? Have I met you before...

90
00:08:12,965 --> 00:08:14,142
You don't remember that song, man?

91
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:16,037
It's "I have seen you before,"
goddamn it.

92
00:08:16,103 --> 00:08:16,866
So, how does it go?

93
00:08:16,965 --> 00:08:19,203
Is it "What's your name?
I have seen you before?

94
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:20,383
May I walk you to your door?"

95
00:08:20,454 --> 00:08:24,068
Jesus Christ. What you talkin' about?
You know the damn song.

96
00:08:24,137 --> 00:08:27,815
? What's your name??

97
00:08:27,881 --> 00:08:31,658
? I have seen you before?

98
00:08:31,723 --> 00:08:35,237
? What's your name??

99
00:08:35,308 --> 00:08:39,052
? May I walk you to your door??

100
00:08:57,076 --> 00:08:58,768
- What's up?
- What's up?

101
00:08:58,837 --> 00:09:00,463
What's goin' on?

102
00:09:00,533 --> 00:09:03,250
How you doin', man?
Here you go.

103
00:09:03,317 --> 00:09:07,093
- Be careful with that.
- Thank you.

104
00:09:07,254 --> 00:09:09,143
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:09,207 --> 00:09:10,768
Look, I want you to do
what I asked you.

106
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,143
I got you.
This is what you're gonna say:

107
00:09:13,209 --> 00:09:15,121
"You massage
the universe's spine,

108
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:18,992
the way you twirl through time,
and leave shadows on the sun."

109
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,521
- You got that?
- You a bad motherfucker.

110
00:09:22,588 --> 00:09:24,596
I ain't got that though.
Give me that shit again.

111
00:09:24,668 --> 00:09:28,533
"You massage the universe's spine
the way you twirl through time,

112
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:31,062
and leave shadows on the sun."

113
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,893
That's all right.

114
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:17,800
I didn't do anything.

115
00:10:17,935 --> 00:10:19,594
- What's this?
- It's just weed.

116
00:10:19,664 --> 00:10:22,120
Just weed?
It's illegal weed.

117
00:10:22,224 --> 00:10:25,391
What makes you think you
can use drugs in our city?

118
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,368
- What's your name?
- Raymond Joshua.

119
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:30,094
- Raymond what?
- Raymond Joshua.

120
00:10:30,163 --> 00:10:32,619
Buddy, let me tell you.
You're in deep shit.

121
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:35,087
Let's go, man.

122
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:50,511
Matter before the court,
number 47 on the lock-up,

123
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:53,816
United States vs. Raymond Joshua.

124
00:10:53,884 --> 00:10:55,892
Your Honor, the defendant
was apprehended

125
00:10:55,996 --> 00:10:57,752
fleeing the scene of a shooting.

126
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:00,277
A man was shot in the head
during a drug transaction

127
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,260
in which this man was involved.

128
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:04,539
My God, what a way
to start a Monday morning.

129
00:11:04,607 --> 00:11:08,538
Here you have the Congress taking
a lot of power from the city counsel

130
00:11:08,609 --> 00:11:10,681
and the office of the Mayor,
the Board of Education,

131
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:15,327
and the people of Washington
and then we have Mr. Joshua.

132
00:11:15,395 --> 00:11:17,534
Without getting into whether
you're guilty or not,

133
00:11:17,605 --> 00:11:22,428
I just know that these drugs
are killing our community.

134
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:25,349
Mr. Prosecutor, what's the
government's position on bail?

135
00:11:25,414 --> 00:11:26,822
The government feels
that this defendant

136
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:29,286
poses a substantial risk
of flight, Your Honor.

137
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,750
He was apprehended fleeing
the scene of a shooting.

138
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:36,292
We would like to see the bond
set in the amount of $10,000 surety.

139
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:42,148
This court will enter a plea of
not guilty on behalf of Mr. Joshua.

140
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:44,806
And this proceeding is adjourned
until Monday morning, 11 o'clock.

141
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:46,339
Thank you, gentlemen.

142
00:11:46,413 --> 00:11:47,755
Thank you, Your Honor.

143
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:07,826
Watch your step.

144
00:12:10,326 --> 00:12:11,471
- Watch your step.
- Ow!

145
00:12:19,225 --> 00:12:22,095
Turn on the fucking air conditioner.

146
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,100
AC, motherfucker.
Give me some fucking AC.

147
00:12:26,172 --> 00:12:27,928
Man, will you
shut the fuck up back there?

148
00:12:27,996 --> 00:12:30,484
My name is fucking Jimmy Huang.

149
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,405
Get me the fuck out of this van.

150
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,181
Hey! You, up there in the front.

151
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:40,182
I shouldn't fucking
be in this van, man.

152
00:12:40,255 --> 00:12:42,011
You know who my dad is?

153
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,864
Shit. It's hot in this fucking van.

154
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,557
You scared, man?

155
00:12:46,627 --> 00:12:48,569
Shut the fuck up.

156
00:13:12,906 --> 00:13:14,915
It ain't nothing but sweat
inside my hands.

157
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,710
So I dig into my pockets...

158
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,436
There's an MC in the van.

159
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:22,918
There's an MC in the van.
Great.

160
00:13:22,991 --> 00:13:25,446
Another black rapper.

161
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:30,350
...thinking of the master plan.

162
00:13:30,674 --> 00:13:33,642
So I walk up the street,
whistling this,

163
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,919
feeling out of place,
'cause, man, do I miss,

164
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,152
a pen and a paper,
a stereo, a table...

165
00:13:40,148 --> 00:13:42,768
Would you shut the fuck up?
Would you shut the fuck up?

166
00:13:42,838 --> 00:13:45,741
Would you shut the fuck up?
Would you shut the fuck up?

167
00:13:45,815 --> 00:13:49,678
Would you shut the fuck up?
Would you shut the fuck up?

168
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:54,007
Get this guy to shut up.

169
00:14:16,161 --> 00:14:18,879
I'd like to find out who's
gonna keep this little thing quiet.

170
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:23,389
Shake his hand and say, thank you.

171
00:14:23,651 --> 00:14:28,706
Damn. I miss Italy.

172
00:14:28,902 --> 00:14:31,074
Do you miss Italy?

173
00:14:32,198 --> 00:14:34,916
You ever listen to Wu Tang?

174
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:09,739
All right.
Let's go. Let's go.

175
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:26,032
What's up, man?

176
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,953
- You heard about Mike?
- Yeah, I heard about it.

177
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,315
So, what happened?

178
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:32,912
I don't even know.

179
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:34,710
I can't call it.

180
00:15:34,938 --> 00:15:37,722
You know, the word in here is,
"watch your back."

181
00:15:39,742 --> 00:15:41,083
All right.

182
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:00,992
- What's wrong with me?
- China dog.

183
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,206
What's wrong with me,
China dog?

184
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:04,129
I shouldn't be in this
fucking jail, man!

185
00:16:04,261 --> 00:16:05,691
I don't want to be here!

186
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:08,253
I shouldn't be here
with you motherfuckers!

187
00:16:08,423 --> 00:16:11,806
Get the fuck away from me!
I'll get the fuck away from you!

188
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:14,084
Fuck you, motherfucker!

189
00:16:14,218 --> 00:16:16,356
Hey, man, y'all need to shut up!

190
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,914
Just get me some toilet paper.

191
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,756
What do you want with me, man?
Get off of me.

192
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:26,724
What's up, yo?
What's up, yo?

193
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:29,547
What, what the fuck
do you want with me, man?

194
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,557
I'll fuckin'
kill all of you! Shit!

195
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,290
Get the fuck off me,
I'll kill you!

196
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,183
- Sit the fuck down, man.
- Fuck you, man!

197
00:16:35,249 --> 00:16:36,972
Sit down. Sit down.
All right?

198
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:42,411
What's your fuckin'
problem, yo?

199
00:16:42,546 --> 00:16:45,711
You're about to get fuckin'
killed in this place.

200
00:16:46,323 --> 00:16:48,878
Yeah? I guess I am.

201
00:17:01,849 --> 00:17:04,817
What the fuck you tryin' to do?
Why don't you just sit down, all right?

202
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:08,852
If you're not supposed to be here,
then you won't be here.

203
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:11,703
Give it a second
and you'll disappear.

204
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:15,415
Hey, Mr. Huang, let's go.

205
00:17:15,486 --> 00:17:17,626
That's me.

206
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:20,183
I told you I was out of here, man.

207
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,313
Time to go.

208
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:32,062
I told you guys.

209
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:33,950
Remember when
you spit on my buddy?

210
00:17:34,085 --> 00:17:36,224
We got a
goin' away present for you.

211
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:38,115
- Let's go.
- A what?

212
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:40,037
A what? No!

213
00:17:51,658 --> 00:17:53,545
I'm your attorney.

214
00:17:53,642 --> 00:17:55,137
I've been assigned by the court
to represent you.

215
00:17:55,211 --> 00:17:58,508
I'm a public defender.
I've been asked by the prosecutor

216
00:17:58,605 --> 00:18:02,022
to see if we can cut a deal,
which means plead guilty or cop out.

217
00:18:02,095 --> 00:18:04,168
Let me ask you this:
Are you guilty?

218
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:09,261
- Of what?
- Of the marijuana,
possession of marijuana.

219
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:17,299
Uh, I mean, I don't know.

220
00:18:19,732 --> 00:18:21,904
I can't get a trial
or something?

221
00:18:21,972 --> 00:18:23,828
Well, you can get a trial.
They call that cop or rock.

222
00:18:23,893 --> 00:18:25,649
You can take the cop,
we plead,

223
00:18:25,717 --> 00:18:27,376
or you can rock,
which means we can take it to trial.

224
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:29,235
But if you lose,
you're looking at ten.

225
00:18:29,303 --> 00:18:32,500
Mandatory ten.
You have to do 85 percent of ten.

226
00:18:32,568 --> 00:18:34,675
Which means eight and a half years.

227
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:36,121
So wait. If I try to fight it,

228
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:38,674
I have to serve more time for
just trying to fight it?

229
00:18:38,747 --> 00:18:41,081
If you get found guilty, you would.

230
00:18:41,339 --> 00:18:45,203
And usually, the success ratio
of convictions on drug cases,

231
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,196
is about 9O to 95 percent.

232
00:18:47,261 --> 00:18:49,912
If you lock up ten people,
nine, nine and a half go to jail.

233
00:18:50,014 --> 00:18:53,911
But the chances of beating it,
is like trying to throw a...

234
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:55,871
a snowball into an elephant's
mouth at a hundred feet.

235
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,825
You can't make it.

236
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,476
You are in trouble.
You are a victim, a casualty of war.

237
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:02,269
You got two options, three:

238
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:04,346
You can plead guilty
to a simple possession,

239
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,321
which is two to three years,
eighteen months to two years.

240
00:19:07,395 --> 00:19:10,627
You can go to trial and run the
risk of doing ten years if guilty.

241
00:19:10,693 --> 00:19:14,338
Or, you can cooperate.
Which means you can rat, snitch,

242
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:17,756
blow the whistle on whoever you want
to blow it on, in order to get out.

243
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:20,614
Cooperate, which I'm not gonna do.

244
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:23,168
You say I can't even fight it
'cause I'll serve more time.

245
00:19:23,273 --> 00:19:26,920
This doesn't make any fucking sense.
None whatsoever, man.

246
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:28,330
It don't make any sense at all.

247
00:19:28,396 --> 00:19:29,737
There's niggas
out there doing mad shit.

248
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:33,896
My man is down, you know?
They shoot my man, they're running free.

249
00:19:33,965 --> 00:19:35,688
There's niggas out there
selling all types of shit.

250
00:19:35,758 --> 00:19:37,581
I got a quarter pound of weed,
and you're telling me here

251
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:40,582
I got to serve five to ten years
and there's not shit you can do for me?

252
00:19:40,656 --> 00:19:42,512
I don't have any choices?

253
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:44,999
Fuck this
old casualty of war shit, man.

254
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:48,783
I'm saying,
I'm just out there surviving.

255
00:19:48,851 --> 00:19:50,989
What can I do?

256
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,947
I know it sounds like a lot of time,

257
00:19:53,012 --> 00:19:55,249
but most guys get
a lot longer than that, man.

258
00:19:55,349 --> 00:19:59,343
The best or most I can do
is try to get you two or three.

259
00:19:59,446 --> 00:20:03,025
Even if you were innocent,
I could only get you two to three.

260
00:20:03,095 --> 00:20:05,682
You are a victim, brother.
You're black, you're young,

261
00:20:05,752 --> 00:20:07,346
you come from the Southeast,
you're in the inner city.

262
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,101
You don't have a chance.
Your best chance is to see

263
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:13,072
how little time you get
before you get back to society.

264
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,602
It ain't about beating it.
When they lock you up, you dead.

265
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:20,600
Raymond Joshua, step out.

266
00:20:25,246 --> 00:20:27,255
When you're in this building,
I want you to stay alive.

267
00:20:27,328 --> 00:20:30,491
So listen carefully to me.
Nobody in here is your brother.

268
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,593
I don't care if they're as black
as you are, or as light as daylight.

269
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,227
They are not your brother.

270
00:20:35,299 --> 00:20:37,340
You mind your business, son,
and you'll stay alive.

271
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:39,355
Every day somebody
gets shanked in here.

272
00:20:39,428 --> 00:20:41,283
Every day somebody
gets beaten up in here.

273
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:42,875
We got predators in here, son.

274
00:20:42,948 --> 00:20:46,047
We got people that'll cut your throat
for nothing but a pack of cigarettes.

275
00:20:46,117 --> 00:20:50,113
You mind your business in here, son.
Do you understand where you are?

276
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:53,575
Have a seat in here.

277
00:21:10,223 --> 00:21:11,784
Raymond Joshua.

278
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:21,295
Right over here, come on.
Put everything on the table.

279
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,985
Open your mouth.
Lift your arms.

280
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:37,518
Lift your tongue.

281
00:21:37,592 --> 00:21:39,446
Lift your balls.

282
00:21:39,512 --> 00:21:41,748
Turn around and spread your cheeks
with both hands at the same time.

283
00:21:41,816 --> 00:21:44,305
Show me the bottom
of your feet.

284
00:21:44,377 --> 00:21:46,201
Turn around and face me.
Bend over at the waist.

285
00:21:46,266 --> 00:21:48,984
Run your fingers
through your hair.

286
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:50,906
Hold this under your chin
just like this.

287
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:54,226
Your number is going to
be given to you.

288
00:21:54,301 --> 00:21:55,960
It's a sequential number.

289
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:58,037
It's not a random set
of numbers, son.

290
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,769
That number means something.
It's yo'number.

291
00:21:59,838 --> 00:22:02,907
It's yo' number now.
Know what that number represents?

292
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:05,760
276,000. Now listen carefully to me,

293
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,412
and you'll understand
what makes me so angry.

294
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:12,606
We have less than 500,000 people
in the District of Columbia.

295
00:22:12,675 --> 00:22:14,530
Now only 70 percent
of them are black.

296
00:22:14,596 --> 00:22:16,604
Now what's 7O percent
of 500,000?

297
00:22:16,677 --> 00:22:20,574
Do the math. We got about
350,000 black people in DC.

298
00:22:20,647 --> 00:22:23,167
Of the 350,000,
half of them are female, aren't they?

299
00:22:23,591 --> 00:22:25,959
What's that?
Do the math, son, do the math.

300
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:30,303
Less than 175,000 people
are males like yourself.

301
00:22:30,378 --> 00:22:34,405
Not all of 'em are over 21 years of age.
Half of 'em are kids.

302
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:37,772
How the devil, if we got only
75 to 80 thousand adult males

303
00:22:37,836 --> 00:22:41,350
in the District of Columbia,
is this number 276,000 today?

304
00:22:41,453 --> 00:22:42,916
Figure it out for yourself.

305
00:22:42,989 --> 00:22:46,057
We've exhausted the 21-year-olds,
20-year-olds, 19-year-olds.

306
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:47,982
We're working on 18.

307
00:22:48,047 --> 00:22:51,179
We're moving down the line.
By the time we cross 300,000,

308
00:22:51,248 --> 00:22:53,769
we'll be down to
16-and 17-year-olds.

309
00:22:53,841 --> 00:22:56,298
We're wiping out our race
in Washington, DC.

310
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,760
And here you are in here
playing these silly ass games.

311
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,935
Well, we got something for you.
Welcome to the DC jail.

312
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,682
You might make it outta here,
you might not.

313
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:19,802
Door three. One gate.

314
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:52,209
Well bakey bakes,

00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:02,964

only little fuckin' put put,

318
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:06,300

a bigger fuckin' case,

319
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:09,303
cuz my love the nigga's

320
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,376
what the fuck did they want,
it's a motherfuckin' gun,

321
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:16,444
from the G's APC's where the
fucker's from, niggas better run,

322
00:25:16,546 --> 00:25:18,401
if they don't catch up

323
00:25:18,466 --> 00:25:21,599
they just get fucked
by my motherfuckin' focus.

324
00:25:21,668 --> 00:25:25,281
Knock you off your motherfuckin'ass,
not afraid to pass,

325
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:28,317
get me all of that cash,
so I can quit my fuckin' gash.

326
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,457
Die, foci,
then the motherfuckin' gangs

327
00:25:31,527 --> 00:25:34,377
selling cocaine roll my fuckin'
brain like Jesse James...

328
00:25:34,441 --> 00:25:38,468
Yo sun, as in solar, simply,
because we are, we be,

329
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:40,775
the rising stars and the sun
that never set.

330
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:43,690
Word up, Jack.
Wanna make a bet, black?

331
00:25:43,787 --> 00:25:44,997
I got the formula.

332
00:25:45,067 --> 00:25:47,075
Throw me in the sky,
and I'll warm ya.

333
00:25:47,148 --> 00:25:50,217
Get your sun block.
Throw me in the cell block.

334
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:52,206
Indeed, I got the science you need.

335
00:25:52,303 --> 00:25:55,784
Lessons more ancient than Greece.
Apollo never my creed, my creed.

336
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,823
Obatala will battle you,
so bring your troops if you wanna.

337
00:25:58,896 --> 00:26:01,799
Satellites in the sky,
some selling clouds on the corner.

338
00:26:01,873 --> 00:26:04,721
But, we livin' for the land,
from the soil to the sand.

339
00:26:04,787 --> 00:26:07,570
And the water in the sea
be the essence of me.

340
00:26:07,636 --> 00:26:10,386
If you ain't ready for this fruit,
than put it back on the tree.

341
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:13,453
Uh. Give me the strength
to bend back these bars.

342
00:26:13,525 --> 00:26:16,592
Got the locks of Samson.
I'm Sam's son. He's my father.

343
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,574
Tried praying to the Father,
Son, but Holy Ghost.

344
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,535
I miss my motherfucking sanity.

345
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,542
Never been here
and never planned to be.

346
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:25,071
But my own plans had plans for me.

347
00:26:25,145 --> 00:26:28,048
And now that man's
hands got plans for me.

348
00:26:28,122 --> 00:26:31,122
And now that man's
hands got plans for me.

349
00:26:31,194 --> 00:26:33,815
And now that man had plans,
so I jetted and ran.

350
00:26:33,885 --> 00:26:36,952
The mike cord pulled me back.
I should have dropped it
from my hand

351
00:26:37,022 --> 00:26:39,957
and left it at the scene of the rhyme.

352
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:44,181
Now we all serving time.
Even my prose is on probation.

353
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:47,705
Refugees they ain't just Haitian.
Come on. Fucking shit. Come on.

354
00:26:47,777 --> 00:26:51,040
Keep it going now.
Ba bam, ba bam bam...

355
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:54,719
And what the fuck.
You're fuckin' with a psychopath nut.

356
00:26:55,107 --> 00:26:59,069
Put on my fucking glasses and 'bout
to bust a nut in your ass motherfucker,

357
00:26:59,365 --> 00:27:01,538
as I blast
in your motherfucking gut...

358
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:03,651
Put a motherfuckin'
mask on your face.

359
00:27:03,815 --> 00:27:06,533
You should of never fucked
with a nigga from the base.

360
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:09,666
So now I'm packing steel,
keeping the shit really real,

361
00:27:09,737 --> 00:27:12,552
motherfucka you ducked trying
to hop up in the truck.

362
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:13,991
Got blocked down.

363
00:27:14,187 --> 00:27:18,596
So motherfuckas really want the judge
to understand my motherfucking deal.

364
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,832
I'm packin' steel.
Slam dunkin' like Shaquille O'Neal.

365
00:27:21,901 --> 00:27:24,869
...bam, ba bam, ba bam bam.

366
00:27:24,973 --> 00:27:27,691
I had to be strong...
That shit is dope, yo.

367
00:27:27,758 --> 00:27:30,061
Damn, man. You got some
talent with you man.

368
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,950
- Oh, definitely.
- That shit was tight, yo.

369
00:27:32,112 --> 00:27:33,967
We are lookin' out, son.

370
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:06,740
What's up, partner?
Thanks for the tray, slim.

371
00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:07,574
I know you ain't want'n that shit.

372
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,629
Come on, nigga.
I ain't trying to play this shit.

373
00:28:09,726 --> 00:28:10,904
What's up, partner?

374
00:28:10,974 --> 00:28:13,309
I ain't eaten all day.
I ain't trying to play.

375
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:17,053
I ain't trying to play this shit.
Get the fuck off me, nigga.

376
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,640
It's my motherfucking tray.
It's my tray.

377
00:28:19,712 --> 00:28:22,200
I'm eating this tray.

378
00:28:22,305 --> 00:28:23,036
Nigga, you don't know me.

379
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:24,567
I ain't about to sit here
and let you eat my shit.

380
00:28:24,738 --> 00:28:26,080
I ain't got to know you.

381
00:28:26,147 --> 00:28:27,839
You ain't gonna eat
unless I say you eat.

382
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:30,592
This is my motherfucking tray.

383
00:28:31,141 --> 00:28:34,278
Any problems?

384
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:37,823
Nah. If I don't eat,
don't nobody fucking eat.

385
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:42,493
Oh shit. Here we go.

386
00:28:51,691 --> 00:28:53,578
Break it the fuck up.

387
00:29:14,515 --> 00:29:16,785
Get the fuck back to your cells.

388
00:29:16,884 --> 00:29:18,892
Shit. Lock it down.

389
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:37,943
Hey...

390
00:29:38,044 --> 00:29:39,899
Wakey, wakey.
Hands off snakey.

391
00:29:41,693 --> 00:29:43,548
Open 20.

392
00:29:47,775 --> 00:29:49,629
Grab your shit.
We're leaving.

393
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:54,107
Take care of yourself,
all right?

394
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,901
Peace, black.

395
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,302
- Keep it real, man.
- Mm-hm.

396
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:07,458
Some get by,
but they never get away.

397
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,641
First cell to your left.

398
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,931
- Stand right here.
- Yo.

399
00:30:25,003 --> 00:30:26,017
How ya' doin' G?

400
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:28,011
- Where the fuck's my paper at?
- Your man's here to see you.

401
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,412
- Who's that?
- I got a 32 ready for him.

402
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,123
What's happening?

403
00:30:40,081 --> 00:30:42,252
Come on in, man.

404
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:46,860
Take a seat.

405
00:30:46,931 --> 00:30:49,420
I'm Hopha, man.

406
00:30:49,524 --> 00:30:52,045
- What's going down?
- Mike told me a lot about you.

407
00:30:52,117 --> 00:30:53,873
He told me a lot
about you too, man.

408
00:30:53,941 --> 00:30:55,349
You know what I'm saying?

409
00:30:55,702 --> 00:30:57,677
So what the cops is
telling you, man?

410
00:31:00,119 --> 00:31:03,219
I know they been trying to
ask you questions about Mike.

411
00:31:03,641 --> 00:31:06,359
They asked me a few questions,
but I don't know shit, y'know.

412
00:31:06,426 --> 00:31:09,274
So I just told 'em
I don't know shit.

413
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:11,738
You sure
you ain't telling 'em nothing?

414
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:14,387
I didn't tell them shit, yo.

415
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:19,222
See, this is the problem, man.
People think you did.

416
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:22,524
- What?
- Tell them something.

417
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:25,973
That shit that happened, you probably
didn't know nothing about this,

418
00:31:26,497 --> 00:31:27,958
but you're the
center of attention now.

419
00:31:28,096 --> 00:31:31,327
- What do you mean?
- Everybody wants a piece of you, man.

420
00:31:31,394 --> 00:31:34,690
- How's that?
- Because they think you
set Mike up.

421
00:31:34,755 --> 00:31:36,543
I didn't do that shit, yo.
I didn't do that.

422
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,467
I know you didn't fucking do it.

423
00:31:38,533 --> 00:31:41,665
They don't know that shit.
They coming for you, man.

424
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:45,761
You got every motherfucker in here
ready to take a piece of your ass.

425
00:31:45,831 --> 00:31:49,345
And if I take the fucking veil down,
it's gonna fucking happen.

426
00:31:51,848 --> 00:31:54,697
You stepped right
into the frying pan now.

427
00:31:56,523 --> 00:31:59,754
So be ready to get down.
You want some treats?

428
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:01,511
I got some sweets.

429
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:05,387
Some cookies or something?
Here, let me hook you up.

430
00:32:05,645 --> 00:32:07,336
Take some of this.

431
00:32:07,438 --> 00:32:09,741
Where's the guard at?
Where's my fucking newspaper at?

432
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:13,040
That son of a bitch.

433
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:16,912
That nigga brings me some shit, too.
I ain't saying you're sweet,

434
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:20,012
want some baby powder?

435
00:32:20,435 --> 00:32:22,639
Here, get yourself some Kool-Aid,
or something, man.

436
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,392
Take what you want, man.
Take what you fucking want.

437
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,974
You home, man. You home, baby.
You know what I'm saying?

438
00:32:30,293 --> 00:32:32,662
You home here now.

439
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:34,768
You with us.

440
00:32:36,216 --> 00:32:41,007
Word. Let the boys know that we
got a new member now.

441
00:32:41,112 --> 00:32:43,481
Everything's gonna be
all right now.

442
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,085
You like that book?

443
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:49,980
Most of all, I must see to it

444
00:32:50,046 --> 00:32:53,908
that I do not lend myself
to the evils which I condemn.

445
00:32:58,656 --> 00:33:01,558
Yeah, well, you know what
I say about that?

446
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:04,447
Stay the fuck out our way.

447
00:33:04,641 --> 00:33:07,326
That's all I got to say
about that shit.

448
00:33:07,394 --> 00:33:09,369
You know what I mean?

449
00:33:09,507 --> 00:33:11,811
Hey, I love people,
but I don't tell them that shit.

450
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,726
You know what I mean?

451
00:33:14,021 --> 00:33:15,647
And when it comes to me and mine,

452
00:33:15,749 --> 00:33:18,979
I defend mine very well.
Fuck that.

453
00:33:19,046 --> 00:33:21,862
I want to get out of the game, yo.
For real. That's all I want.

454
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:25,442
Ain't no way out of this, man.
Ain't no way out of this, man.

455
00:33:25,514 --> 00:33:27,718
If you move into records,
if you move into shit, with us, man,

456
00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:31,234
you are taking the game with you.
It's all in sync, man.

457
00:33:31,306 --> 00:33:35,050
I ain't trying to be a part of
the whole game, gang bullshit...

458
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:37,385
- Listen, listen. Fuck that.
- I'm trying to write.

459
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:39,014
- I need a pen and some paper.
- I don't wanna hear that shit.

460
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:43,080
Nigga, you are in jail, man.
Bottom line.

461
00:33:43,247 --> 00:33:45,190
You down with us.

462
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,401
Ain't no coming out of this shit.

463
00:33:47,505 --> 00:33:50,888
This shit's the same shit
on the fucking street.

464
00:33:50,993 --> 00:33:53,548
The beef ain't gonna stop for you.

465
00:33:53,619 --> 00:33:55,790
Who the fuck is you?
You gonna stop this beef?

466
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,771
You can't stop it.

467
00:33:59,156 --> 00:34:00,946
You help us stop it.

468
00:34:02,741 --> 00:34:05,229
I'm trying to think straight, man.
I need a pen and a pad.

469
00:34:05,302 --> 00:34:08,173
I hear you, man. I hear you, man.
It's gonna be all right.

470
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:10,931
You know what I mean?
It's gonna be all right.

471
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,172
Don't worry about it.

472
00:34:13,242 --> 00:34:15,096
Just wait until you get here.

473
00:34:15,162 --> 00:34:17,846
Guess y'all gonna have to
make me secretary of state.

474
00:34:19,356 --> 00:34:22,008
Or secretary of defense.

475
00:34:22,077 --> 00:34:24,281
How's that?

476
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:27,317
What, you don't like that?
Minister of defense, then.

477
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:30,587
Minister of information,
but can fight. How's that?

478
00:34:30,655 --> 00:34:34,202
You know what I mean?
'Cause you gonna have to fight, cuz.

479
00:34:34,273 --> 00:34:37,341
Make no mistake about it.
This is jail.

480
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:41,977
Yeah, we got to handle that.

481
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:44,735
When he come out,
we got to take care of that.

482
00:34:44,803 --> 00:34:48,863
It's motherfucking personal.
It's personal.

483
00:34:48,932 --> 00:34:50,013
'Cause you know
that nigga we beat down?

484
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:53,022
Yeah, you know
he down with Hopha, right?

485
00:34:53,128 --> 00:34:54,983
- What?
- Yeah, and they going against us.

486
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,285
'Cause ain't nothing gonna stop
this motherfucking drug game.

487
00:34:57,352 --> 00:34:59,328
You know? Stop none
of my motherfucking business.

488
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,696
'Cause we ain't having that shit.
It's Thug Life for life.

489
00:35:02,762 --> 00:35:04,967
I got the word he's
down with Union Crew.

490
00:35:05,035 --> 00:35:07,523
We gonna get him.
He's down with Union Crew.

491
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:11,143
And I don't like no bitch-ass nigga
cutting into my motherfucking business.

492
00:35:11,214 --> 00:35:13,581
- You get what I'm saying?
- We get you. We down with you.

493
00:35:13,646 --> 00:35:14,661
Fuck that.

494
00:35:14,734 --> 00:35:17,288
If I got to push the steel
in the motherfucking nigga.

495
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,920
We gonna do that.

496
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:42,130
We got some problems.

497
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,273
- See them niggas over there?
- Check 'em out.

498
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:46,199
You know what I'm saying?

499
00:35:46,264 --> 00:35:47,159
Yeah, I see them, niggas.

500
00:35:47,226 --> 00:35:49,364
Man, there's a difference
with us and them, man.

501
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:51,322
You know what I'm saying?

502
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,067
We organized.

503
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:56,630
That bunch of
stupid motherfuckers, man.

504
00:35:56,732 --> 00:35:58,587
They can't handle no business.

505
00:35:58,652 --> 00:36:00,509
We already did that drug shit

506
00:36:00,574 --> 00:36:03,259
and that fucking
hand-to-hand bullshit, man.

507
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:06,395
I want cake, B.
Don't you want cake?

508
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:08,319
We want fucking cake, man.

509
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,209
If y'all want some cake, man.

510
00:36:13,282 --> 00:36:16,513
We do this shit, make this move
on these motherfuckers, man.

511
00:36:18,629 --> 00:36:20,320
I don't give a fuck what happens.

512
00:36:40,235 --> 00:36:43,203
Even your man don't
fucking like you, faggot.

513
00:36:43,276 --> 00:36:44,259
Fuck you.

514
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,603
Yeah, fuck y'all.

515
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,557
If you was fucking smart,
you'd be over here, too.

516
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:50,445
We wouldn't have to be doing this.

517
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:52,747
- Y'all trying to rap?
- We wouldn't have to
be doing this.

518
00:36:52,815 --> 00:36:56,810
Fuck these niggas, man.
Fuck them niggas, man.

519
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,785
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
You stay back. Lay back. Lay back.

520
00:36:59,891 --> 00:37:01,680
You make the choice who
the fuck you gone to be with.

521
00:37:01,747 --> 00:37:03,635
You get your ass
over there with Union Crew.

522
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:04,626
- Fuck Thug Life.
- Fuck you.

523
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,634
- Fuck Thug Life.
- Fuck you, nigga.

524
00:37:56,197 --> 00:37:58,053
Hey, how you doing?

525
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,273
Is it hot enough for you out there?

526
00:38:14,827 --> 00:38:16,683
Just my keys in my front pocket.

527
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,853
What's up, yo?

528
00:39:04,956 --> 00:39:06,005
What's up?

529
00:39:06,397 --> 00:39:08,286
You see him there?

530
00:39:08,382 --> 00:39:10,389
Man, I want you to do
the right thing, man.

531
00:39:10,495 --> 00:39:12,383
What the fuck is the right thing?

532
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:14,553
The right thing is for me
to just be my fucking self.

533
00:39:14,625 --> 00:39:16,479
You know what I'm saying?
Do you know what I'm saying?

534
00:39:16,545 --> 00:39:17,974
I mean, it's not about...

535
00:39:18,049 --> 00:39:20,636
It's hard to be yourself here, man.

536
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:22,714
Look around, man.

537
00:39:22,786 --> 00:39:24,925
It's hard to be yourself in here, man.

538
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:31,140
My crew gotta know where you stand.
I know where they standing at.

539
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:32,286
What the fuck?

540
00:39:32,358 --> 00:39:34,596
This ain't no rites
of passage or some shit.

541
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:38,206
You see them lined up?

542
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,648
We got our shit locked over here.

543
00:39:40,744 --> 00:39:42,720
Ain't nobody coming over here,
fucking with this shit.

544
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:44,386
There's a place for you over here.

545
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:46,401
If not, go the fuck over
there with your friend, then.

546
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:55,395
All right, look,

547
00:39:55,471 --> 00:39:56,877
let's not get too close,
you know what I mean?

548
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,334
- It's going down today.
- It's going down today.

549
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:09,362
It's going down today.

550
00:40:09,459 --> 00:40:11,728
He gots to go.

551
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:14,578
He gots to go.
He gots to go.

552
00:40:14,643 --> 00:40:16,532
Pass that joint.

553
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:18,769
I want everybody high.
Everybody high.

554
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:20,561
I want everybody high.

555
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:21,940
It's the thug in us.

556
00:41:07,622 --> 00:41:08,964
Fuck you.

557
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:13,950
I stand on the corner of
the block slinging amethyst rocks,

558
00:41:14,024 --> 00:41:17,703
drinking 40's of Mother Earth's
private nectar stock, dodging cops.

559
00:41:17,770 --> 00:41:19,331
'Cause five-oh be the 666.

560
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:21,476
And I need a fix of that purple rain,

561
00:41:21,548 --> 00:41:23,490
the type of shit that
drives membranes insane.

562
00:41:23,596 --> 00:41:26,913
Oh, yeah, I'm in the fast lane,
snorting candy yams

563
00:41:26,989 --> 00:41:29,805
that free my body and soul
and send me like Shazam.

564
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,741
Never question who I am.
God knows.

565
00:41:32,816 --> 00:41:36,647
And I know God personally.
In fact, he let's me call him me.

566
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:41,129
Yeah, I'm serious B.
Doggonned niggas plottin' shit, lovely,

567
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:44,050
but the Feds is also plottin' me.

568
00:41:44,115 --> 00:41:46,320
They're tryin'
to imprison my astrology.

569
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,388
Put our stars behind bars,
our stars in stripes,

570
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:52,113
using blood-splattered
banners as nationalist kites.

571
00:41:52,183 --> 00:41:55,412
But I control the wind.
That's why they call it the hawk.

572
00:41:55,479 --> 00:41:58,612
I am Horus, son of Isis,
son of Osiris,

573
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:00,983
worshipped as Jesus,
resurrected like Lazarus,

574
00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:03,318
but you can call me Lazzie, lazy,

575
00:42:03,417 --> 00:42:06,734
yeah, I'm lazy, cause I'd rather sit
and build than work and plow a field.

576
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,113
Worshipping a daily
yield of cash green crops.

577
00:42:09,179 --> 00:42:12,497
Stealing us was the smartest thing
they ever did.

578
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:15,414
Too bad they don't teach
the truth to their kids.

579
00:42:15,518 --> 00:42:18,136
Our influence on them
is the reflection they see

580
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:21,469
when they look into their minstrel
mirror and talk about their culture.

581
00:42:21,535 --> 00:42:24,089
Their existence is that
of a schizophrenic vulture.

582
00:42:24,255 --> 00:42:26,014
Yeah. There's no repentance.

583
00:42:26,114 --> 00:42:30,043
They are bound to live an infinite
consecutive executive life sentence.

584
00:42:30,115 --> 00:42:31,839
So what are you bound to live, nigga?

585
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,795
So while you're
out there serving the time,

586
00:42:33,795 --> 00:42:36,611
I'll be in sync with the sun
while you run from the moon.

587
00:42:36,676 --> 00:42:39,328
Life of the womb reflected by guns.

588
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:42,147
Worshiper of moons.
I am the sun.

589
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:44,743
And we are
public enemies number one.

590
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:50,596
One, one, one.
One, one, one.

591
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,150
I forgot what
the fuck I was thinking.

592
00:43:13,521 --> 00:43:15,344
Are you all right?

593
00:43:16,274 --> 00:43:18,643
- Are you okay?
- Um, yes.

594
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,845
I just saw what you
did out there.

595
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:24,178
Do you need any help?

596
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,252
- No.
- Cool.

597
00:43:28,534 --> 00:43:30,804
Um, hi.
My name is Lauren.

598
00:43:30,871 --> 00:43:33,971
Lauren Bell.
I teach writing here.

599
00:43:37,051 --> 00:43:38,906
Where did you get that from?

600
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,758
I'm sorry, um...

601
00:43:40,891 --> 00:43:44,340
The poem that you did out there.
Did you, did you write that?

602
00:43:44,443 --> 00:43:45,371
Yeah.

603
00:43:45,468 --> 00:43:46,962
- Excuse me.
- Um...

604
00:43:47,068 --> 00:43:49,208
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

605
00:43:49,277 --> 00:43:51,133
What are you doing
out here in the hall?

606
00:43:51,198 --> 00:43:52,891
He's just talking to me.
He's on his way to...

607
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,815
Okay. But he's not supposed
to be out here.

608
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,176
North three, let's go.
Right now. Right now.

609
00:43:58,273 --> 00:43:59,997
You have no right to be out here.
Let's go.

610
00:44:00,097 --> 00:44:02,301
All right you're in north three.
I'll put in a request for you.

611
00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:04,443
I'll put in a request for you.

612
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:06,686
You have to tell the CO
that you want to come to class,

613
00:44:06,756 --> 00:44:08,317
and he'll let you come down.

614
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:10,747
You are out of place.
Let's go.

615
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:22,049
I've been searching myself, man.

616
00:44:23,498 --> 00:44:26,215
I know you all have too.

617
00:44:26,314 --> 00:44:28,420
The world is fucking
leaving us behind, man.

618
00:44:28,491 --> 00:44:30,379
What Ray said was right.

619
00:44:30,443 --> 00:44:32,167
I didn't agree with his methods,
you know what I'm saying?

620
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:35,053
- You know...
- What the hell was that?

621
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:37,255
I still don't fuckin'
know entirely, man.

622
00:44:37,326 --> 00:44:41,899
But what that nigga did out there
was just fucking fascinating.

623
00:45:00,117 --> 00:45:02,869
I ain't fucking coming back here, man.

624
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:05,108
Fuck that shit.
I love y'all and all that shit.

625
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:07,608
I ain't coming the fuck back here.

626
00:45:07,608 --> 00:45:10,194
You know what I mean?
I ain't turning on y'all.

627
00:45:10,264 --> 00:45:11,858
Like I said, I love y'all,

628
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:14,035
but I'm telling it
the way it fucking is, man.

629
00:45:15,451 --> 00:45:19,577
Them motherfuckers outside
this place don't give a fuck about us.

630
00:45:19,645 --> 00:45:22,363
We started off fighting,
we gonna end off fighting.

631
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:25,431
But how we fight is the fight.

632
00:45:25,502 --> 00:45:27,925
That's the way it goes.

633
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,658
If I'm gonna die for something,

634
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,703
I'm gonna die for something
that's worth it, dig?

635
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:53,058
We've been discussing the
chapters as we've been going along,

636
00:45:54,921 --> 00:45:57,572
but now we've finished
the whole book.

637
00:45:57,705 --> 00:46:03,403
And what I want to know is...

638
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:08,140
what came to your mind last night

639
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:10,507
when you were lying in your cell

640
00:46:10,573 --> 00:46:13,194
and you were
reading the assignment?

641
00:46:13,264 --> 00:46:15,685
What was the first thing
that came to your mind?

642
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,478
I mean, sure,
I know I want to stay off the street.

643
00:46:18,545 --> 00:46:22,856
I know I want to be a positive
person to my family, right.

644
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,411
But I know that, me personally,
if the situation arose

645
00:46:26,483 --> 00:46:30,609
where it was either starve
or my children starving,

646
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:34,869
or doing the right thing,
then, you know, it's trey ball.

647
00:46:34,934 --> 00:46:37,206
Or Monster Cody got to
do what he got to do.

648
00:46:37,206 --> 00:46:40,054
I do not agree with Joseph.

649
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:44,730
Sadly, too many of our brothers
got the mentality of Joe,

650
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:46,804
and come here and say,
because of this and that,

651
00:46:46,875 --> 00:46:49,461
I'm gonna put this in my hand
using my family for an excuse.

652
00:46:49,532 --> 00:46:52,761
When all the time, like you said,
you got to be responsible for you.

653
00:46:52,828 --> 00:46:56,059
So you gonna use,
"My family was hungry so I went out
and shot a motherfucker for money."

654
00:46:56,126 --> 00:46:57,304
Fuck no.
You still coming to jail.

655
00:46:57,438 --> 00:47:00,406
I don't know whether
you know it or not, brother,
but we are capitalists.

656
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:03,229
Whether we're capitalists
on a small scale,

657
00:47:03,295 --> 00:47:05,239
we live in a capitalist country.

658
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:06,687
And that is what we are.

659
00:47:06,754 --> 00:47:10,072
We are born to learn how
to capitalize on whatever it is.

660
00:47:10,179 --> 00:47:11,259
It's about money.

661
00:47:11,363 --> 00:47:14,942
So Joe and John are saying that there
are not enough resources out there

662
00:47:15,012 --> 00:47:18,428
to help you change your life.
Is that true?

663
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:20,770
We just happened
to be born our color,

664
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:23,424
and we at the bottom of the ladder.
You understand?

665
00:47:23,495 --> 00:47:26,912
Now, if I could make it out,
and have me some real dough,

666
00:47:26,985 --> 00:47:28,774
yeah, then it wouldn't be like this.

667
00:47:28,841 --> 00:47:30,947
All right.
Y'all ready for the poetry reading?

668
00:47:31,018 --> 00:47:32,424
Yes.

669
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,084
I didn't hear everybody.

670
00:47:34,186 --> 00:47:35,430
I said are y'all ready
for the poetry reading?

671
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:37,025
Yes.

672
00:47:38,058 --> 00:47:40,003
- Ron, you ready?
- Yeah.

673
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,215
Let's go.

674
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,101
The name of
my little piece is, uh, "Why."

675
00:47:49,168 --> 00:47:55,083
I shot three motherfuckers,
but I didn't know why.

676
00:47:55,153 --> 00:47:58,384
I guess I just wanted
to see something die.

677
00:47:58,451 --> 00:48:02,643
You see,
I bought this gun for a few rocks

678
00:48:02,708 --> 00:48:07,315
just to get even, so I thought,
with those shit-eating cops.

679
00:48:07,414 --> 00:48:10,415
Holding the cold, blue steel
in the palm of my hand,

680
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:15,470
not quite sixteen, yet totally a man.

681
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:17,999
My only plan was money in my hand.

682
00:48:18,074 --> 00:48:21,621
I wore Falacci, Gucci,
Nikes, and Eddie B.

683
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:24,920
I was the coolest
motherfucker in Southeast DC.

684
00:48:26,748 --> 00:48:29,596
School? What the fuck.

685
00:48:29,661 --> 00:48:31,767
That was a thing
of the past.

686
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:36,412
Getting paid, school and all that
other square shit could kiss my ass.

687
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:39,580
Mad at my bun,
toying with my gun,

688
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:43,512
tipped on over to my favorite
poolroom just to have some fun.

689
00:48:43,586 --> 00:48:47,002
Rips was at full blast,
so I chalked up my cue,

690
00:48:47,106 --> 00:48:49,280
ready to kick some ass.

691
00:48:49,349 --> 00:48:52,513
I played a few hours,
beat all the old timers

692
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:54,655
and was about to go.

693
00:48:54,727 --> 00:48:57,116
Until the three-

694
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:00,356
one of the three bama
motherfuckers stepped on my toe.

695
00:49:01,607 --> 00:49:04,870
A split second later,
whip, bam, it was on.

696
00:49:04,938 --> 00:49:07,428
The ass kicking begun.

697
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:10,848
I ducked a few pool balls
and eased out my gun.

698
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:15,207
Ratta-tat-tat and that was that.
Three was whacked.

699
00:49:15,277 --> 00:49:16,869
Ten years later.

700
00:49:16,972 --> 00:49:19,658
As I sit here in my
jail cell about to cry,

701
00:49:19,727 --> 00:49:20,523
I'm thinking,

702
00:49:20,591 --> 00:49:23,177
I shot three motherfuckers
and I don't know why.

703
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:29,584
Thank you, Ron.

704
00:49:29,777 --> 00:49:34,420
Oh, I, um, I don't know
if all of you guys know,

705
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,196
but, um,
today's my last day here.

706
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,865
Oh, God.

707
00:49:43,031 --> 00:49:45,748
I'm gonna miss you guys.

708
00:49:45,847 --> 00:49:49,144
- We gonna miss you too.
- Especially me.

709
00:49:49,209 --> 00:49:52,406
Um, they, um,

710
00:49:52,666 --> 00:49:55,087
it's so wild that we had this
conversation today, because,

711
00:49:55,194 --> 00:49:58,261
they have,
they cut this program.

712
00:49:59,868 --> 00:50:02,936
And it's just brought home
the fact that, you know,

713
00:50:03,006 --> 00:50:05,789
it really isn't about
rehabilitation anymore, you know?

714
00:50:05,855 --> 00:50:07,415
And you were right, Joe.

715
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:08,700
Like I was trying to tell you earlier,

716
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:11,505
Yeah, it's gonna be hard
when you leave here.

717
00:50:11,572 --> 00:50:13,580
It's gonna be real hard.

718
00:50:13,652 --> 00:50:18,224
It's really fucked up that you were
born in Southeast, in the ghetto.

719
00:50:18,293 --> 00:50:20,943
It's really fucked up
that you were born black.

720
00:50:21,044 --> 00:50:23,695
It's really fucked up that you've
had a hard time in your life.

721
00:50:23,765 --> 00:50:25,620
Whatever your story is,

722
00:50:25,685 --> 00:50:27,540
whatever it is that brought
you here in your life,

723
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:29,460
that shit is really fucked up.

724
00:50:29,525 --> 00:50:33,268
If you keep shoving the anger
and the pain and the frustration down,

725
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,788
and you keep saying that's all right,
I'm gonna do what I gotta do

726
00:50:35,861 --> 00:50:39,090
and you don't let it come out,
that keeps pushing you down.

727
00:50:39,157 --> 00:50:40,368
That is your prison.

728
00:50:41,013 --> 00:50:44,079
You gotta let that shit out 'cause
once you let that frustration out,

729
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:47,630
it doesn't hold you back anymore.
It doesn't lock you down.

730
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:49,522
And then you can stand up
with some courage.

731
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,499
You can say, okay,
yeah, it's fucked up,

732
00:50:51,606 --> 00:50:53,679
but I am not gonna live like this.

733
00:50:53,782 --> 00:50:56,749
I am going to take my destiny
into my own hands.

734
00:50:56,854 --> 00:50:59,058
That's the only way to go now.

735
00:50:59,127 --> 00:51:02,705
I grew up with guys just like y'all.
All of y'all.

736
00:51:02,774 --> 00:51:05,589
My brother was sitting in your seat.

737
00:51:05,654 --> 00:51:07,509
My brother's not here anymore.

738
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:11,989
He grew up in your era,
Joe, in your era, Ronald,

739
00:51:12,055 --> 00:51:15,535
when everybody wanted to
be Superfly. Remember that?

740
00:51:15,607 --> 00:51:18,291
It was all about being Superfly
or the Mac, remember that?

741
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:20,814
Now it's about being
a gangsta or OG.

742
00:51:23,415 --> 00:51:26,230
He had a good heart just like y'all.
I know y'all are good guys.

743
00:51:26,295 --> 00:51:28,335
The people out there,
they see your face in the paper,

744
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:31,503
they think y'all,
they think you're monsters.

745
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:35,121
I know you're good guys inside.
My brother had a good heart.

746
00:51:38,616 --> 00:51:41,169
I know your dreams.
I've been there.

747
00:51:42,648 --> 00:51:48,049
But chasing them, thinking you
can achieve them by selling drugs...

748
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:52,311
that's just a part of the trap, y'all.
That's just a part of the trap.

749
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:56,239
And yeah, you're right, Ronald.
The cycle just keeps continuing.

750
00:51:56,313 --> 00:52:00,437
Who's gonna stop it?
Y'all got to stop it. Y'all been in.

751
00:52:00,505 --> 00:52:02,927
Y'all can go back out,
change your life

752
00:52:03,033 --> 00:52:06,895
and show the young brothers
that they don't have to
come back in here like this.

753
00:52:08,377 --> 00:52:11,574
Freedom isn't out here.

754
00:52:11,642 --> 00:52:14,325
It's in here.

755
00:52:14,650 --> 00:52:16,821
You can be free anytime you want.

756
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:20,569
Anytime.

757
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:27,737
Never give anyone the power
to take away your freedom.

758
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:31,729
That's yours.
It don't belong to nobody but you.

759
00:52:33,211 --> 00:52:35,153
Remember that.

760
00:52:38,043 --> 00:52:40,498
I'm not going to go
on and on.

761
00:52:40,571 --> 00:52:43,538
Besides, my tissue's
falling apart.

762
00:52:43,611 --> 00:52:46,099
- We gonna miss you, all right?
- I'm gonna miss you too, Red.

763
00:52:46,171 --> 00:52:48,440
And I'm gonna miss you too.
And I'm gonna miss you too.

764
00:52:48,507 --> 00:52:51,639
- Give me a hug.
- All right. All right.

765
00:52:56,092 --> 00:52:58,426
Ritchy, give me a hug, baby.

766
00:52:58,491 --> 00:53:00,280
- Okay.
- You gonna be okay?

767
00:53:00,380 --> 00:53:03,762
I'm gonna be all right.
You gonna be okay?

768
00:53:03,868 --> 00:53:06,257
I'm gonna be fine after
that poem you wrote me.

769
00:53:06,364 --> 00:53:08,339
You gonna write me now, right?

770
00:53:08,412 --> 00:53:10,867
Okay. Good.
All right, now.

771
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,882
Take care, baby. Bye-bye.

772
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:16,693
Ray, you hangin'
back for a minute?

773
00:53:19,581 --> 00:53:21,435
So what did you think of the class?

774
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:25,976
I think you're a wonderful teacher.

775
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:31,348
- Ray, what are you doing in here?
- I sold weed.

776
00:53:31,453 --> 00:53:34,268
So you just
happened to be selling weed?

777
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:36,220
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know.

778
00:53:36,285 --> 00:53:37,747
I got caught.

779
00:53:37,853 --> 00:53:41,050
Yeah, I know you got caught.
I know you got caught.

780
00:53:41,118 --> 00:53:43,322
I mean, it's not that simple.
It's not...

781
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:47,734
- I mean...
- What, are you in school?

782
00:53:47,806 --> 00:53:49,464
No.

783
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:52,633
So you sell weed for a living?
That's it?

784
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:54,774
And you write poetry.
And you read books.

785
00:53:54,846 --> 00:53:56,701
I never really thought of
myself as writing poetry.

786
00:53:56,766 --> 00:54:00,062
You know, I write,
I'm here on,

787
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:03,192
I'm really here on a
petty weed charge.

788
00:54:04,415 --> 00:54:08,987
Although, I've been told
that I have to cop a plea.

789
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,780
And if I do,

790
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:17,204
I may be looking at
like a couple of years,

791
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:19,996
but... I don't know.

792
00:54:24,543 --> 00:54:28,024
- I don't know how to say...
- Just stay in touch.

793
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:31,391
Just stay in touch.

794
00:54:31,744 --> 00:54:35,454
You never know.
You never know, you know?

795
00:54:39,808 --> 00:54:41,401
I gotta go.

796
00:54:58,849 --> 00:54:59,863
You got me thinking.

797
00:54:59,937 --> 00:55:01,847
You remember that book
that was in my cell?

798
00:55:01,922 --> 00:55:06,078
The Art of War?
Man named Sun Tzu?

799
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:09,658
Some old guy.
Chinese guy a long time ago.

800
00:55:09,761 --> 00:55:12,445
The man said it's about
learning to lead people.

801
00:55:12,578 --> 00:55:17,335
It's about being able
to win wars without violence.

802
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:19,198
You know what I mean?

803
00:55:19,266 --> 00:55:23,063
He wasn't no sucker, now,
he'd get ready to get down, you know?

804
00:55:23,139 --> 00:55:26,717
But he won wars from the beginning

805
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:28,826
without ever having to use violence.

806
00:55:28,899 --> 00:55:30,971
He said that's where
the real power is.

807
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:32,919
Shit bugged me the fuck out.

808
00:55:33,027 --> 00:55:34,750
I thought what the fuck's
this nigga talkin' about?

809
00:55:34,819 --> 00:55:36,859
I mean, I thought about it.

810
00:55:36,963 --> 00:55:38,938
But how many people
really do that, you know?

811
00:55:39,043 --> 00:55:43,298
How many people really do that?
You did that.

812
00:55:44,003 --> 00:55:45,280
I'm telling you, man,

813
00:55:45,380 --> 00:55:47,714
you got more talent
than maybe even you know.

814
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,666
You got a hell of a lot of decisions.

815
00:55:49,731 --> 00:55:52,153
I can't help you
with the decisions, man.

816
00:55:52,228 --> 00:55:54,235
You know,
but I'm always there for you.

817
00:55:54,308 --> 00:55:57,624
I've made my decisions, yo.
You can see.

818
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,318
There's no fear in my heart no more.
There's no fear.

819
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:02,013
I don't give a fuck.

820
00:56:02,084 --> 00:56:04,255
I'm scared every day,
but I'm not afraid.

821
00:56:04,325 --> 00:56:07,772
You dig?
To me there's a difference.

822
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:12,667
To you there's a difference.
You showed that.

823
00:56:12,772 --> 00:56:15,740
You gonna be a great man.
You got great things to fucking do.

824
00:56:16,325 --> 00:56:21,954
And one of them is to pass
this to an old friend of mine.

825
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:25,282
This is something a friend of
mine gave me a long time ago.

826
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,804
I'm gonna get you out of here.
All right?

827
00:56:27,877 --> 00:56:32,579
- How you gonna get me outta here?
- You're not listening to me, man.

828
00:56:32,645 --> 00:56:34,500
You're not listening to me, man.

829
00:56:34,565 --> 00:56:36,802
I'm gonna put up
the bail for you. All right?

830
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:40,001
If you do this piece
of work for me, I'm here.

831
00:56:43,398 --> 00:56:45,252
- What's your name?
- Raymond Joshua.

832
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,238
Okay. You're being released
on cash collateral.

833
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:52,485
Take your suit off
and put it in the basket.

834
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:12,833
- Yo, where's my shirt?
- It got lost. Shit happens.

835
00:57:15,751 --> 00:57:17,694
Take that.
You going home in these.

836
00:57:29,544 --> 00:57:31,486
Let's see your arm band.

837
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:34,430
Hold it right there
so I can see it. Okay.

838
00:57:34,504 --> 00:57:39,294
Hey, Ray, this is your
last time in here, right?

839
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:41,278
I want you to take something out
the door with you when you leave.

840
00:57:41,352 --> 00:57:43,654
Those six digits
on that band I told you about,

841
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,695
they'll be there waiting
for you if you ever come back.

842
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,518
Now get your ass out of my jail.

843
00:57:48,617 --> 00:57:50,854
Door.

844
00:58:10,538 --> 00:58:12,513
All right,
going out with one.

845
00:58:12,586 --> 00:58:15,303
- What's your name?
- Raymond Joshua.

846
00:58:15,370 --> 00:58:18,501
- Your number?
- 274001.

847
00:58:18,602 --> 00:58:20,773
Okay. Officer, what's
he going out on?

848
00:58:20,874 --> 00:58:22,729
He's going out
on cash collateral.

849
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,249
- Good luck. Take care.
- Thanks a lot.

850
00:58:33,323 --> 00:58:34,665
All right.

851
00:59:56,047 --> 00:59:59,309
- How you doing, Ray?
- Hey, Ray, where you been?

852
00:59:59,375 --> 01:00:01,285
- What's up?
- Where you been, Ray?

853
01:00:01,391 --> 01:00:04,261
- I saw a police car, Ray.
- Yeah?

854
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,822
- What's happening?
- Nothin' much.

855
01:00:06,895 --> 01:00:09,067
Where you been at
for a couple of days?

856
01:00:09,136 --> 01:00:13,064
- We ain't seen you.
- Bye, Ray.

857
01:00:21,071 --> 01:00:22,894
Everything cool, man?

858
01:00:26,736 --> 01:00:28,045
How did they treat
you in camp, man?

859
01:00:28,112 --> 01:00:30,119
- All right.
- Just hold on for a second.

860
01:00:30,224 --> 01:00:32,231
- I got something for ya.
- All right.

861
01:00:47,697 --> 01:00:51,112
- What's up, man?
- Yooo.

862
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:53,583
What's up, man?

863
01:00:53,841 --> 01:00:55,696
What's up?

864
01:00:57,778 --> 01:01:01,739
- I'm alive, man.
- I cannot believe this shit.

865
01:01:01,841 --> 01:01:03,729
You been all right
in there?

866
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:08,681
Yeah, I been cool.
You... I been great.

867
01:01:08,786 --> 01:01:10,826
Well, I'm all right, man.

868
01:01:10,898 --> 01:01:12,840
You know what?

869
01:01:12,914 --> 01:01:15,303
I'm blind now, man.

870
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:17,648
I can't see shit, man.

871
01:01:17,714 --> 01:01:20,431
Somebody in Dodge City gonna
have to take care of that.

872
01:01:22,483 --> 01:01:26,509
- Take care of what?
- Man, I'm hurtin', man.

873
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,586
And the only thing I can do

874
01:01:28,659 --> 01:01:32,074
to feel better is to know that
somebody else is hurtin'.

875
01:01:32,179 --> 01:01:34,350
What we gonna do is
handle this.

876
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:37,068
Handle this how, nigga?
What the fuck are you talking about?

877
01:01:37,139 --> 01:01:38,994
- Are you fucking real or what?
- No, no, no, no. What...

878
01:01:39,091 --> 01:01:40,946
I got a motherfucking
bullet in my head,

879
01:01:41,011 --> 01:01:42,767
and whoever put it there,
they gonna pay.

880
01:01:42,835 --> 01:01:45,039
Now is you with that or what?

881
01:01:45,107 --> 01:01:47,922
Man, we've been doing
this for years. For what?

882
01:01:47,988 --> 01:01:49,842
I don't understand it.
I understood it before,

883
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:51,882
but I don't understand that shit.

884
01:01:51,956 --> 01:01:53,385
'Cause you know what?

885
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:55,184
When I was inside,
I realized something.

886
01:01:55,252 --> 01:01:58,252
I was blind for a long time, yo.

887
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,886
I see now. And I see that
this shit has to end.

888
01:02:04,052 --> 01:02:06,387
There's not shit you can do.

889
01:02:06,453 --> 01:02:10,065
There is no one you can shoot,
not even the fucking doctor,

890
01:02:10,197 --> 01:02:12,107
that would give you your
fucking vision back.

891
01:02:13,717 --> 01:02:15,921
There's nothing,
no one you could shoot.

892
01:02:16,021 --> 01:02:17,908
You could shoot the sun,

893
01:02:19,477 --> 01:02:22,511
and everybody else
would just be blind.

894
01:02:23,798 --> 01:02:25,903
I spoke to your man inside, yo.

895
01:02:25,973 --> 01:02:29,388
- You what?
- I spoke with your man, yo.

896
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:32,145
- Hopha.
- What'd he say?

897
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:33,675
What'd he say?

898
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,565
He said the same shit I'm saying.
That this shit is silly.

899
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:38,736
He don't want any type of retaliation.

900
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,173
Man, that's bullshit.
Fuck that bullshit you talking.

901
01:02:41,238 --> 01:02:42,929
It's not bullshit.

902
01:02:42,999 --> 01:02:44,854
Man, Hopha ain't
say nothing like that, man.

903
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:48,465
He know Dodge City
sticks together no matter what.

904
01:02:48,535 --> 01:02:51,382
Anybody in Dodge City go down,

905
01:02:51,446 --> 01:02:53,454
the motherfucker's being dealt with.

906
01:02:53,527 --> 01:02:55,698
- What's this?
- What is this?

907
01:02:55,767 --> 01:02:57,261
Where the fuck you get this from, man?

908
01:02:57,335 --> 01:03:02,518
Your boy. He knew you wouldn't
believe shit I was telling you.

909
01:03:02,583 --> 01:03:05,366
And what the fuck
are we retaliating for?

910
01:03:05,432 --> 01:03:07,319
We don't need this shit any more.

911
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,271
So what are you saying?
Dodge City is breaking up?

912
01:03:09,335 --> 01:03:12,117
What the fuck you talking about?
This ain't the temptations or some shit.

913
01:03:12,184 --> 01:03:13,875
We ain't breaking up.

914
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:17,878
What makes you think
me and you can go talk to somebody

915
01:03:17,976 --> 01:03:20,626
that tried to kill me, man,
and tried to kill you?

916
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:22,638
The fucking mayor can't
even talk to these people.

917
01:03:22,712 --> 01:03:24,338
The government can't even
talk to these people.

918
01:03:24,408 --> 01:03:26,263
I ain't talking about the mayor.
I ain't talking about the government.

919
01:03:26,328 --> 01:03:28,947
Nigga, I love you.
I love you.

920
01:03:29,017 --> 01:03:32,595
I just don't wanna see you go out
like a million other niggas before you.

921
01:03:37,721 --> 01:03:39,576
Man, I'm scared.

922
01:03:39,641 --> 01:03:43,864
- I know you're scared.
- Can you help me out, man?

923
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:46,132
- I'll help you, Jack.
- Help me, man.

924
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:04,757
Time is running out tick-tock
like grains of sand?

925
01:04:04,826 --> 01:04:08,088
Every man's sharpest man,
like steel's sharpest steel?

926
01:04:08,154 --> 01:04:09,780
The threat of a war is real?

927
01:04:09,851 --> 01:04:13,167
Where my soldiers
fought on the battlefield?

928
01:04:24,699 --> 01:04:25,812
- What's up, man?
- What's up, babe?

929
01:04:25,883 --> 01:04:29,112
- What's up, man?
- What's up with you?

930
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,146
Man, look, man.
What the fuck is up, dude?

931
01:04:32,219 --> 01:04:34,488
I'm trying to get back.
I'm trying to get back.

932
01:04:34,556 --> 01:04:37,109
Motherfuckers.
Man, they blinded you, man.

933
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:39,035
I'm trying to blind
one of them other niggas.

934
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:42,395
- They drew first blood, baby.
- I understand.

935
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:43,986
And they know me.
You know what I'm saying?

936
01:04:44,092 --> 01:04:46,328
They know all of us.
They know how we go.

937
01:04:46,396 --> 01:04:47,672
They know how we go.

938
01:04:47,740 --> 01:04:49,464
You gonna go over there
and take one of them out, right?

939
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:51,441
- Pow pow baby.
- Pow pow baby.

940
01:04:51,516 --> 01:04:53,371
Live by the sword,
I'm gonna die by the sword.

941
01:04:53,436 --> 01:04:55,258
- You know what I'm saying?
- For who?

942
01:04:55,325 --> 01:04:57,267
Who the fuck you fighting for?
What are you fighting to protect?

943
01:04:57,341 --> 01:04:59,031
For my man.
Dodge City.

944
01:04:59,196 --> 01:05:01,498
You live in the motherfucking projects.
It's an experiment.

945
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:03,834
Projects, experiment.
Government experiment.

946
01:05:03,901 --> 01:05:06,552
You serving time outside
of the penitentiary

947
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:09,436
doing exactly what they
want you to do. Pow pow all day.

948
01:05:09,501 --> 01:05:11,388
That's the motherfucking
master plan, nigga.

949
01:05:11,453 --> 01:05:14,235
That's the motherfucking master plan.

950
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:17,171
Let's see what Mike got to say about it.

951
01:05:17,277 --> 01:05:19,382
- Mike, make the house call.
- I'm making the call, man.

952
01:05:19,453 --> 01:05:22,072
You know, I want the guns down.
I want the guns down.

953
01:05:22,142 --> 01:05:25,851
- You heard what he said.
- Let's put the guns down.
- Put the guns down.

954
01:05:25,917 --> 01:05:28,635
There was one last bullet
that was shot around here,

955
01:05:28,702 --> 01:05:30,807
and that was the bullet in my head.

956
01:05:45,310 --> 01:05:48,725
? Time is running out tick-tock
like the grains of sand?

957
01:05:48,894 --> 01:05:51,415
? My man's sharpest man,
like steel's sharpest steel?

958
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,306
? The threat of a war is real?

959
01:05:53,471 --> 01:05:55,860
? Where my soldiers
fought on the battlefield?

960
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:23,965
- I can't believe you made it.
- I did.

961
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:26,016
Well, come on in.

962
01:06:33,441 --> 01:06:36,288
Hey, lmani, hold on.
Ray, meet lmani.

963
01:06:36,353 --> 01:06:38,971
- Hi.
- How ya' doing?

964
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,896
- Ray. Ray, this is DJ.
- Yo, what's up

965
01:06:40,961 --> 01:06:43,809
- This is Ray, a friend of mine.
- I'm DJ Renegade.

966
01:06:43,873 --> 01:06:46,939
DJ's a phat poet.
You got to hear his work.

967
01:06:47,009 --> 01:06:48,602
Actually, tonight you probably
hear some of his work because

968
01:06:48,706 --> 01:06:50,561
we're gonna do
a little poetry reading.

969
01:06:50,626 --> 01:06:53,975
Brothers and sisters, love will leave
you melancholy as a muted trumpet.

970
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:57,377
Bluer than a cloudless sky,
bluer than a Viking's eye.

971
01:06:57,474 --> 01:07:01,216
You see, love is a blue-bottle
fly flitting between blue and green.

972
01:07:01,282 --> 01:07:04,348
Wings raggedy as a pair of old jeans.

973
01:07:04,418 --> 01:07:07,386
Merci beaucoup.
Love is Winnie the Pooh

974
01:07:07,459 --> 01:07:09,914
doing voodoo in corrective shoes.

975
01:07:12,418 --> 01:07:16,379
- Yo, you write?
- Um, a little bit.

976
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:18,338
Oh, okay.
You gonna kick a piece later?

977
01:07:18,403 --> 01:07:21,534
- Um, I don't know.
- Yeah, He's gonna kick
a piece later.

978
01:07:21,603 --> 01:07:24,637
I have a million
things going on in my head.

979
01:07:24,739 --> 01:07:26,976
Oh, okay.
Oh, so you gonna free-style?

980
01:07:27,043 --> 01:07:28,385
No.

981
01:07:29,411 --> 01:07:34,365
His intergalactic free-style
jazz licks... my ears.

982
01:07:35,075 --> 01:07:38,818
As I ride his tongue and groove

983
01:07:38,884 --> 01:07:43,619
to the sound of chords
no man has ever touched.

984
01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,881
His touch tempts me to taste

985
01:07:46,948 --> 01:07:51,138
flesh of my flesh
from which he is made.

986
01:07:51,204 --> 01:07:52,960
His invisible strokes are felt

987
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,672
as he stands on
the stage in front of me.

988
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:01,280
A mike and a million
miles away from me.

989
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:03,235
Everything is kind of new now.

990
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,210
Like I wouldn't want to read
anything I'd written before.

991
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:06,878
It's too old.

992
01:08:08,101 --> 01:08:10,141
It's nice to have
you on the outside, truly.

993
01:08:10,213 --> 01:08:12,156
It's good to be on
the outside. Truly.

994
01:08:12,229 --> 01:08:14,368
It's all right. I'm not tripping.

995
01:08:14,437 --> 01:08:16,641
You massage the universe's spine

996
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:19,328
the way you twirl through time

997
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:23,164
and leave shadows on the sun.

998
01:08:25,414 --> 01:08:27,836
My love is the wind song.

999
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:31,205
If it is up to me, I'll never die.

1000
01:08:31,302 --> 01:08:34,117
If it is up to me,
I'll die tomorrow a thousand times

1001
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:36,102
in an hour
and live seven minutes later.

1002
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:39,038
If it is up to me,
the sun will never cease to shine

1003
01:08:39,175 --> 01:08:41,030
and the moon will
never cease to glow

1004
01:08:41,095 --> 01:08:43,845
and I'll dance a million tomorrows
in the sun rays of the moon waves

1005
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:46,661
and bathe in the
yesterdays of days to come,

1006
01:08:46,727 --> 01:08:49,989
ignoring all of my afterthoughts
and preconceived notions.

1007
01:08:50,055 --> 01:08:54,398
If it is up to me,
it is up to me.

1008
01:08:54,471 --> 01:08:57,919
And thus, is my love.
Untainted.

1009
01:08:58,023 --> 01:08:58,971
Eternal.

1010
01:09:00,807 --> 01:09:04,036
The wind is the moon's imagination.
Wandering.

1011
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:08,324
It seeps through cracks,

1012
01:09:08,392 --> 01:09:12,516
ripples the grass,
explores the unknown.

1013
01:09:14,312 --> 01:09:16,549
My love is my soul's imagination.

1014
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:19,975
How do I love you?

1015
01:09:21,001 --> 01:09:22,211
Lmagine.

1016
01:09:24,008 --> 01:09:26,245
I can't believe you actually came.

1017
01:09:28,552 --> 01:09:31,814
Glad I came.
Very glad I came.

1018
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,953
I have thought of you.

1019
01:09:34,057 --> 01:09:39,076
Um, and, um...

1020
01:09:39,146 --> 01:09:41,633
What else?

1021
01:09:41,705 --> 01:09:43,615
What else is there?

1022
01:09:47,178 --> 01:09:49,120
Today, now.

1023
01:09:49,226 --> 01:09:51,713
There's tomorrow.

1024
01:09:51,882 --> 01:09:53,890
And the next day and the next.

1025
01:09:53,961 --> 01:09:56,580
Not today.

1026
01:09:56,714 --> 01:09:59,813
- Not now.
- Yeah. Well...

1027
01:09:59,978 --> 01:10:02,880
Tomorrow and the next day
and the next for me

1028
01:10:02,954 --> 01:10:06,118
is not exactly like...

1029
01:10:09,963 --> 01:10:11,719
I'm sorry, I mean...

1030
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:13,892
- Ray...
- lf, if you want me to go...

1031
01:10:13,963 --> 01:10:18,666
I don't know what I want you to
do to be quite honest with you.

1032
01:10:18,731 --> 01:10:20,673
Um, today you're here.

1033
01:10:20,747 --> 01:10:23,496
Tomorrow and the next day,
I mean, you still,

1034
01:10:23,564 --> 01:10:25,386
you still have to go to court.

1035
01:10:25,451 --> 01:10:31,267
I mean, you still have to possibly,
um, go away.

1036
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,334
I still have to try to get back
into prison to do my job...

1037
01:10:35,404 --> 01:10:39,779
No. I really can't.

1038
01:10:39,884 --> 01:10:42,273
I can't go there right now.
I just can't.

1039
01:10:44,077 --> 01:10:46,378
It's really difficult, Ray.

1040
01:10:46,828 --> 01:10:48,235
Who you telling?

1041
01:10:48,332 --> 01:10:51,561
You made an
impression on me.

1042
01:10:51,628 --> 01:10:54,084
And, um, it's funny,

1043
01:10:54,157 --> 01:10:58,183
I wasn't certain of when
I'd be able to see you again.

1044
01:10:59,149 --> 01:11:00,392
But...

1045
01:11:02,829 --> 01:11:06,658
this is all I'm asking for, now.

1046
01:12:30,609 --> 01:12:32,551
Look at the little one
with the ponytail.

1047
01:12:58,931 --> 01:13:00,524
So you coming to
the slam tonight?

1048
01:13:00,690 --> 01:13:04,433
Um, I don't know.
I may.

1049
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:06,418
- You should.
- I want to.

1050
01:13:06,578 --> 01:13:09,775
You should. You should.
I can get you up on stage.

1051
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:12,941
I just, yeah. I'm not trying,
I not thinking about performing.

1052
01:13:14,067 --> 01:13:17,515
I need to think.
You know, I just...

1053
01:13:18,195 --> 01:13:20,050
I have to go
to court on Monday.

1054
01:13:21,620 --> 01:13:23,758
Wow, that soon?

1055
01:13:23,827 --> 01:13:25,999
Damn, you just got out.

1056
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:32,783
Have you thought about
what you're gonna do?

1057
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:36,907
I have no clue.
I need time to think it over,

1058
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:40,176
'cause I can't see what it is
I'm supposed to be doing now.

1059
01:13:40,244 --> 01:13:42,633
None of this makes sense to me.

1060
01:13:47,893 --> 01:13:49,748
You only have until
Monday though, right?

1061
01:13:49,813 --> 01:13:51,406
- Yes. I only have...
- What did your lawyer say?

1062
01:13:52,949 --> 01:13:54,804
My lawyer told me to cop a plea.

1063
01:13:54,901 --> 01:13:56,756
He told me that's
the best thing I should do.

1064
01:13:56,821 --> 01:13:58,479
He said if I fight it,

1065
01:13:58,549 --> 01:14:00,654
I'll probably just end up
getting more time.

1066
01:14:00,725 --> 01:14:04,021
- It's...
- What's, what's your charge?

1067
01:14:05,526 --> 01:14:07,762
Possession of illegal substance.

1068
01:14:07,829 --> 01:14:10,285
Are you guilty?
Did you do it?

1069
01:14:11,446 --> 01:14:12,908
I had it on me.

1070
01:14:15,126 --> 01:14:17,265
What's going to be is going to be.

1071
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,635
You stand up and you face it.

1072
01:14:19,702 --> 01:14:21,589
It's a lot to face.

1073
01:14:21,686 --> 01:14:24,021
It's a hell of a lot to face...

1074
01:14:25,143 --> 01:14:27,412
...for some weed, you know.

1075
01:14:27,478 --> 01:14:29,202
Man, they caught you with the shit
red-handed.

1076
01:14:29,271 --> 01:14:32,467
- What are you gonna do? Run?
- No, I...

1077
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:34,389
I think there has
to be another way out.

1078
01:14:34,454 --> 01:14:36,789
I pray there has
to be another way out.

1079
01:14:36,855 --> 01:14:41,263
Copping a fucking plea?
That shit is not my way.

1080
01:14:41,335 --> 01:14:43,244
I can't, I can't feel that shit.
I can't see that shit.

1081
01:14:43,319 --> 01:14:45,491
Wait a minute. You acting
like you did not do this shit.

1082
01:14:45,559 --> 01:14:48,112
Like copping a plea would
be like lying to yourself.

1083
01:14:48,215 --> 01:14:49,939
Well, you...
you did that shit, Ray.

1084
01:14:50,007 --> 01:14:52,341
I did do the shit,
but I don't feel guilty about it.

1085
01:14:52,408 --> 01:14:54,098
I don't feel guilty.

1086
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:56,022
I'm sorry,
but I don't feel guilty.

1087
01:14:56,119 --> 01:14:57,432
But you did it.

1088
01:14:57,432 --> 01:14:59,058
So the fuck what?
I don't care.

1089
01:14:59,192 --> 01:15:01,461
- I did it. I did it.
- Yeah.

1090
01:15:01,527 --> 01:15:05,073
But what the fuck did I do?
And what are they doing to me?

1091
01:15:05,144 --> 01:15:07,894
What the fuck is the punishment
for that shit?

1092
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:09,716
There, there has to be magical doors.

1093
01:15:09,816 --> 01:15:12,238
I'm looking for the fucking
magical doors.

1094
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,448
That's what I need.
That's what I need.

1095
01:15:14,584 --> 01:15:17,105
That's what's gonna get me out
of this shit, you know?

1096
01:15:17,177 --> 01:15:21,617
I mean, yesterday,
I woke up in a fucking prison.

1097
01:15:21,721 --> 01:15:24,820
I woke up on a fucking ship.
I woke up there, you know?

1098
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:27,954
I woke up there.
And then I went home.

1099
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:30,293
And I saw that for what it was.

1100
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:32,663
And then, I came here,

1101
01:15:33,817 --> 01:15:37,265
and it was like, it was like
a fucking new world to me.

1102
01:15:37,338 --> 01:15:39,705
It was a new world.

1103
01:15:39,770 --> 01:15:41,680
And I was like, ah,
this is fucking home.

1104
01:15:41,753 --> 01:15:42,735
This is where I need to be.

1105
01:15:42,809 --> 01:15:45,079
This is the shit that I've
dreamt about, you know?

1106
01:15:45,146 --> 01:15:48,659
This is the shit that I can feel.
This is the new world that I want.

1107
01:15:48,730 --> 01:15:52,374
But I don't want to have to
go through the fucking middle
passage to get to the new world.

1108
01:15:52,474 --> 01:15:54,384
That's not for me.

1109
01:15:59,675 --> 01:16:02,228
Look, Ray, all I'm saying
is you made a mistake, baby,

1110
01:16:02,555 --> 01:16:04,410
I mean we all make mistakes.
I've made mistakes.

1111
01:16:04,955 --> 01:16:06,711
All you got to do is
just walk up in that court

1112
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,665
with your head up high.

1113
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:12,058
Accept responsibility
for what you've done. Go to jail.

1114
01:16:12,123 --> 01:16:14,457
Do your time.
Make the most of your time.

1115
01:16:14,523 --> 01:16:16,312
You read, write,
do whatever it is you gotta do...

1116
01:16:16,379 --> 01:16:18,768
What the fuck are you saying?
What are you saying?

1117
01:16:18,876 --> 01:16:21,723
No, no, no, no, no.
This isn't class now.

1118
01:16:21,883 --> 01:16:24,883
My only responsibility
is to my fucking dreams.

1119
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:27,159
You know what I'm saying?
That's my responsibility.

1120
01:16:27,612 --> 01:16:31,158
Not to no other shit like that.
You know, l...

1121
01:16:31,260 --> 01:16:33,595
This is a part of your dreams, Ray.
You cannot have your dreams
if you don't-

1122
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:36,026
This is not
a part of my fucking dreams.

1123
01:16:36,124 --> 01:16:38,546
This is not no fucking metaphor.
This is my life.

1124
01:16:38,620 --> 01:16:40,693
Motherfucker,
who you think you jumping up on?

1125
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:44,697
You don't know this.

1126
01:16:56,413 --> 01:16:59,064
I know about your dreams.

1127
01:16:59,165 --> 01:17:02,427
And I know about not
being able to get your dreams

1128
01:17:02,493 --> 01:17:04,915
and wanting them and having them and
seeing all these roadblocks in your way.

1129
01:17:05,021 --> 01:17:07,323
I know something about that shit, Ray.
It doesn't... -

1130
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:09,594
I haven't been in jail.

1131
01:17:09,662 --> 01:17:12,051
I haven't done time,
but I know something about that, Ray.

1132
01:17:12,126 --> 01:17:15,323
And all I'm saying is,
this thing that you're going through

1133
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:20,409
right now is what is going
to catapult you into a fucking dream.

1134
01:17:20,734 --> 01:17:23,123
You can't see that right now
because you haven't been there.

1135
01:17:23,295 --> 01:17:25,149
- I've been there.
- You haven't fucking been there.

1136
01:17:25,246 --> 01:17:27,327
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Don't you fucking tell me

1137
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:30,109
I haven't been there before.
You don't know me.

1138
01:17:30,207 --> 01:17:32,596
You don't know my fucking
life story, motherfucker.

1139
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,261
And you know mine?

1140
01:17:34,367 --> 01:17:38,012
Oh, yeah.
You just spilled it all right here.

1141
01:17:38,111 --> 01:17:40,319
You don't know what kind of
prisons I've been a part of.

1142
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,134
You don't know what
it's like to sell your ass

1143
01:17:43,199 --> 01:17:45,469
on the street for a hit of crack.

1144
01:17:45,567 --> 01:17:47,128
You don't know what that's
like, motherfucker.

1145
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:49,151
I've been a slave.
Fuck being a prisoner.

1146
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:51,103
Oh, don't come for me,
motherfucker.

1147
01:17:51,103 --> 01:17:52,827
Let me tell you something.

1148
01:17:52,896 --> 01:17:55,481
You don't know me.
Remember that.

1149
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:56,925
You don't know
where I come from.

1150
01:17:56,992 --> 01:17:59,676
But everything you telling
me right now? I know it.

1151
01:17:59,904 --> 01:18:02,325
I know it like the back
of my motherfucking hand.

1152
01:18:02,465 --> 01:18:04,319
What the fuck do you mean
I don't know?

1153
01:18:04,481 --> 01:18:06,717
You've been a fucking slave?
What do you think I've been?

1154
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:07,612
You don't know.

1155
01:18:07,776 --> 01:18:10,198
Where did you think I was
in that fucking metaphor?

1156
01:18:10,272 --> 01:18:13,469
Where do you think I was, huh?
When you were the fucking slave,

1157
01:18:13,569 --> 01:18:16,154
who was the fucking overseer?
Where did you think I was then?

1158
01:18:17,089 --> 01:18:18,496
Who was the one giving it to you?

1159
01:18:18,592 --> 01:18:20,960
Who was the one selling that shit?

1160
01:18:21,025 --> 01:18:22,967
- That was me.
- Oh, oh. Awareness.

1161
01:18:23,137 --> 01:18:26,071
Bing. Say that shit again.
Say it again, goddamn it.

1162
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:28,731
Say it again. Who was it?
Who was it?

1163
01:18:28,801 --> 01:18:30,688
Who was it that put
me in my prison?

1164
01:18:30,754 --> 01:18:34,234
Who was it that enslaved me?
Who was it, goddamn it?

1165
01:18:34,305 --> 01:18:36,672
Who the fuck was it, huh?

1166
01:18:36,737 --> 01:18:39,356
Who was it? Huh?

1167
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:43,713
It was you.
It was you.

1168
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:47,290
It was you.
You wanted to be there.

1169
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:52,128
It ain't easy, baby,
escaping it.

1170
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,904
It hasn't been easy.
It hasn't been easy for none of us.

1171
01:18:59,203 --> 01:19:03,676
You ain't the first motherfucker
to be up in this piece, like this.

1172
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,021
And you won't be the last.

1173
01:19:07,587 --> 01:19:12,344
All I'm trying to do, Ray,
is help you, baby.

1174
01:19:12,451 --> 01:19:14,240
'Cause I've been there.
That's all.

1175
01:19:14,435 --> 01:19:16,672
That's all I'm trying to say.
That's all that was.

1176
01:19:16,836 --> 01:19:18,778
That was just to show you
that I've been there.

1177
01:19:18,883 --> 01:19:21,818
I know what it's like.
I know what the fear is like.

1178
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:25,023
I know what the pain is like.
I know what it's like.

1179
01:19:25,156 --> 01:19:27,360
I know what it's like
to be cornered.

1180
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,631
I know what it's like.

1181
01:19:29,796 --> 01:19:32,284
Just trust me, baby.
Just trust me.

1182
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:35,769
All you gotta do is go through it.
Don't fall into their traps.

1183
01:19:35,908 --> 01:19:39,257
Don't fall into their game.
Please, just go.

1184
01:19:39,365 --> 01:19:42,813
'Cause if you run away from it,
you just gonna get caught up later.

1185
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:46,144
Trust me.

1186
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:48,384
Your freedom is there.
It's waiting for you.

1187
01:19:48,453 --> 01:19:51,617
It's waiting for you.
And oddly enough, baby,

1188
01:19:51,685 --> 01:19:54,882
it's waiting for you
in the goddamned prison.

1189
01:19:54,949 --> 01:19:57,153
It is.

1190
01:20:00,005 --> 01:20:01,532
I know you can't see it.

1191
01:20:01,606 --> 01:20:04,061
I know you can't see it,
but it's there.

1192
01:20:04,134 --> 01:20:05,989
It's there. It's there.

1193
01:20:07,974 --> 01:20:09,949
Ray...

1194
01:20:10,022 --> 01:20:12,924
Ray. Ray.

1195
01:20:13,030 --> 01:20:13,924
Ray!

1196
01:20:16,294 --> 01:20:17,188
Damn.

1197
01:20:58,088 --> 01:20:59,517
Come on, let's hear
it from you tonight.

1198
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,531
Welcome to the Poetry Club,

1199
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:05,414
where the words you say
are the thoughts you live

1200
01:21:05,481 --> 01:21:08,612
and where nothing ever happens
unless you say it first.

1201
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,168
Tonight, let's see
who our first poet is.

1202
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:13,346
Who's gonna be coming up
here for the slam tonight?

1203
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:16,548
Please bring up
Liza Jesse Peterson.

1204
01:21:18,537 --> 01:21:20,577
Ice cream.

1205
01:21:22,953 --> 01:21:25,223
Ice cream.

1206
01:21:25,290 --> 01:21:29,283
I used to be an ice cream fiend.

1207
01:21:37,386 --> 01:21:42,689
You see it all started when I had
a large scoop of Rain Forest Crunch

1208
01:21:42,762 --> 01:21:45,413
with extra walnuts.

1209
01:21:45,514 --> 01:21:47,881
Would you like a cup
or cone, Miss?

1210
01:21:47,946 --> 01:21:51,295
Cup or cone?

1211
01:21:51,403 --> 01:21:53,989
Cup or cone.

1212
01:21:54,059 --> 01:21:55,335
Cup or cone.
I was in a zone

1213
01:21:55,403 --> 01:21:58,185
where I had to make a wise
choice between a cup or a cone.

1214
01:21:58,251 --> 01:22:00,640
You see,
it's more fun with a cone,

1215
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:03,049
because I lick the tip

1216
01:22:03,115 --> 01:22:06,563
and then I crunch
and munch the cone.

1217
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:08,522
And then I lick the tip again,

1218
01:22:08,588 --> 01:22:10,497
and I crunch
and I munch on the cone

1219
01:22:10,571 --> 01:22:12,578
until there's one sip
at the bottom tip

1220
01:22:12,651 --> 01:22:15,204
and I pop it in my mouth and
grin because I like that game.

1221
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:24,875
You never cared about my mother...

1222
01:22:51,182 --> 01:22:53,386
I'm writing the poem
that will change the world.

1223
01:22:53,454 --> 01:22:57,513
And it's "like Lilly,
like Wilson" at my office door.

1224
01:22:57,582 --> 01:23:00,615
Lilly Wilson, a recovering
"like" addict.

1225
01:23:00,686 --> 01:23:02,628
The worst I've ever seen.

1226
01:23:02,702 --> 01:23:04,873
So "like-bad"

1227
01:23:04,942 --> 01:23:07,429
that the entire eighth grade

1228
01:23:07,502 --> 01:23:11,758
started calling her,
"like Lilly like Wilson like".

1229
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:17,580
Until I made my classroom
a "like-free" zone,

1230
01:23:17,647 --> 01:23:21,291
and she could not speak for days.

1231
01:23:30,927 --> 01:23:33,382
Another perfect score.
A ten to the fifth power.

1232
01:23:36,079 --> 01:23:39,876
Another 9.5. Don't tell me
there's synchronization here.

1233
01:23:46,512 --> 01:23:48,268
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

1234
01:23:48,336 --> 01:23:50,278
I'm supposed to be
meeting someone here.

1235
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:55,500
Every slam is a finality.

1236
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,967
Every slam is the end.

1237
01:23:58,064 --> 01:24:00,944
And tonight there's
no other way

1238
01:24:00,944 --> 01:24:05,418
to end this slam,
but to bring up here

1239
01:24:05,489 --> 01:24:08,358
one of the true
heroes of poetry.

1240
01:24:10,577 --> 01:24:13,130
Do y'all remember

1241
01:24:13,201 --> 01:24:16,496
when Lauren started out here?

1242
01:24:16,561 --> 01:24:18,350
Yeah.

1243
01:24:21,201 --> 01:24:26,384
Let's please bring Lauren up here

1244
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:30,224
to make it happen for us right now.

1245
01:24:30,322 --> 01:24:34,032
There's nothing else
that can happen in the word

1246
01:24:34,098 --> 01:24:38,441
but to make the word
be the word itself.

1247
01:24:38,994 --> 01:24:40,969
Something that you've heard before.

1248
01:24:41,202 --> 01:24:42,511
Come on, Lauren.

1249
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:47,564
This is, um, a poem that
I found when I was drowning one day.

1250
01:24:48,018 --> 01:24:50,571
This is, um, for a friend
of mine who's um,

1251
01:24:50,931 --> 01:24:53,779
goin' through
a hard time right now.

1252
01:24:59,859 --> 01:25:01,899
I feel like my back
is against a brick wall,

1253
01:25:02,004 --> 01:25:05,037
and I've got a Mac truck
two inches from my face.

1254
01:25:05,107 --> 01:25:09,647
Every cell in my body
is screaming run.

1255
01:25:09,716 --> 01:25:11,887
But I can't.

1256
01:25:11,956 --> 01:25:14,127
I'm kicking and stomping
and running and jumping,

1257
01:25:14,196 --> 01:25:17,098
wreaking all kinds of havoc,
creating a bloody mess

1258
01:25:17,172 --> 01:25:19,822
and I'm going nowhere.

1259
01:25:19,892 --> 01:25:22,162
Somewhere in my mind
I think I am moving.

1260
01:25:22,228 --> 01:25:24,050
Somewhere in reality
I am running.

1261
01:25:24,116 --> 01:25:27,946
Somewhere inside myself
I am oh-so-still.

1262
01:25:28,021 --> 01:25:29,777
Quiet, dead.

1263
01:25:29,877 --> 01:25:32,844
My soul is not rising.
My spirit is not lifting.

1264
01:25:32,948 --> 01:25:35,916
My life is not living.
But I am running.

1265
01:25:36,020 --> 01:25:39,184
Moving through the universe,
a whirling dervish with no end,

1266
01:25:39,253 --> 01:25:41,260
no purpose, no means,
no life left to live.

1267
01:25:41,333 --> 01:25:43,821
And yet still I want to go
to that place where I can run.

1268
01:25:43,894 --> 01:25:46,544
Run free my mind tells me.

1269
01:25:46,614 --> 01:25:50,291
But those two words cannot
occupy the same space in reality.

1270
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:53,009
Run, free.

1271
01:25:53,078 --> 01:25:57,137
My back is against a brick wall.
I got a Mac truck two inches
from my face!

1272
01:25:57,206 --> 01:25:59,627
Well run free, baby.
Run now.

1273
01:25:59,702 --> 01:26:03,379
It just looks hard,
but it's so easy.

1274
01:26:03,478 --> 01:26:05,234
Just turn around and go.
Clip all the wires,

1275
01:26:05,302 --> 01:26:07,506
hookups and hangups,
and then you're home free.

1276
01:26:07,574 --> 01:26:09,941
You can give birth
to an excuse so easily,

1277
01:26:10,038 --> 01:26:11,565
you'll believe
it's always been there.

1278
01:26:11,671 --> 01:26:14,802
Part of the natural order, made
to order by your forever clever mind.

1279
01:26:14,870 --> 01:26:18,580
Constantly protecting you
against things you no longer
need to be protected from.

1280
01:26:18,647 --> 01:26:22,771
And I believe.
I believe like a Holy Roller,

1281
01:26:22,839 --> 01:26:25,206
singing, sweating, preaching,
go tell it on the mountain,

1282
01:26:25,271 --> 01:26:26,580
while speaking in twenty
different tongues,

1283
01:26:26,647 --> 01:26:29,549
while diving
in ten thousand feet of baptismal
water without a life preserver.

1284
01:26:29,624 --> 01:26:32,373
I believe like my bullet-ridden
brother out there somewhere

1285
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,960
right now gurgling blood
through his last breath,

1286
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:38,064
spitting out a red ripe prayer
so new, so sweet, so baby fresh,

1287
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:41,015
so full of truth, he thinks
it can save his life.

1288
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,596
God does not exist
in desperation

1289
01:26:44,664 --> 01:26:47,566
and hope is lying dead somewhere
in the sewer down the street,

1290
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:49,331
around the corner, in the alley,
underneath the feet of somebody,

1291
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:52,434
itching, scratching, trembling,
jonesing for their next hit

1292
01:26:52,505 --> 01:26:55,123
and sucking somebody's dick.

1293
01:26:55,192 --> 01:26:57,614
I got two minutes, ya'll.
I got two motherfucking minutes

1294
01:26:57,688 --> 01:27:00,558
before I run free or die, ya'll.

1295
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:05,041
Two minutes before I smash
my face into the grill of a Mac truck.

1296
01:27:05,113 --> 01:27:08,342
Before I get ten thousand
bricks shoved up my ass.

1297
01:27:08,409 --> 01:27:11,758
Before I run free or die.

1298
01:27:22,841 --> 01:27:25,558
Lauren Bell. Lauren Bell.

1299
01:27:25,626 --> 01:27:28,047
Get her back up here.
I need an encore.

1300
01:27:28,122 --> 01:27:30,872
I need an encore.

1301
01:27:30,938 --> 01:27:35,029
You know, it's about
spreading love.

1302
01:27:35,130 --> 01:27:37,781
And I met somebody recently
who, um,

1303
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:40,217
who touched my, who moved me.

1304
01:27:40,314 --> 01:27:43,511
And I hope he does
the same thing for you.

1305
01:27:43,610 --> 01:27:47,320
Um, this is his first time
reading,

1306
01:27:47,387 --> 01:27:49,722
and he's a big, big talent,

1307
01:27:49,787 --> 01:27:52,209
and he needs our love
and our support.

1308
01:27:52,283 --> 01:27:54,585
And I give you, Ray.

1309
01:27:54,651 --> 01:27:56,539
Come on up here.

1310
01:27:59,004 --> 01:28:01,011
Yeah, come on, Ray.

1311
01:28:01,083 --> 01:28:02,610
Everybody, come on.

1312
01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:09,048
Yeah, come on, Ray.

1313
01:28:28,765 --> 01:28:30,870
- Do it, now.
- Take your time.

1314
01:28:35,741 --> 01:28:38,360
If I could find the spot
where truth echoes,

1315
01:28:38,429 --> 01:28:41,974
I would stand there and whisper
memories of my children's future.

1316
01:28:43,485 --> 01:28:45,307
I would let their future
dwell in my past

1317
01:28:45,373 --> 01:28:48,341
so that I might live
a brighter now.

1318
01:28:48,797 --> 01:28:52,824
Now is the essence of my domain and
it contains all that was and will be

1319
01:28:52,894 --> 01:28:54,487
because I am and I will...

1320
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:57,848
I'll try it again.

1321
01:29:13,950 --> 01:29:15,445
If I could find the spot
where truth echoes,

1322
01:29:15,518 --> 01:29:19,032
I would stand there and whisper
memories of my children's future.

1323
01:29:19,135 --> 01:29:21,045
I would let their future
dwell in my past

1324
01:29:21,151 --> 01:29:23,901
so that I might live
a brighter now.

1325
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:26,269
Now is the essence of my domain,

1326
01:29:26,335 --> 01:29:28,190
and it contains all that was
and will be.

1327
01:29:28,255 --> 01:29:32,117
And I am as I was and will be because
I am and always will be that nigga.

1328
01:29:32,191 --> 01:29:34,558
I am that nigga.
I am that nigga.

1329
01:29:34,623 --> 01:29:38,301
I am that timeless nigga that
swings on pendulums like vines

1330
01:29:38,368 --> 01:29:41,684
through minds of booby-trapped
minds that are enslaved by time.

1331
01:29:41,760 --> 01:29:44,826
I am the life that
supersedes lifetimes, I am.

1332
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:47,766
It was me with serpentine hair
with a timeless stare

1333
01:29:47,872 --> 01:29:50,840
that with immortal glare turned
mortal fear into stone time capsules.

1334
01:29:50,944 --> 01:29:53,879
They still exist as the walking
dead as I do,

1335
01:29:53,984 --> 01:29:56,952
the original suffer-head, symbol
of life and matriarchy's severed head.

1336
01:29:57,025 --> 01:29:58,716
Medusa, I am.

1337
01:29:58,785 --> 01:30:00,825
I am that nigga.
I am that nigga.

1338
01:30:00,897 --> 01:30:02,653
I am that niggga.
I am the Negro.

1339
01:30:02,721 --> 01:30:04,314
Yes, Negro.
Negro from necro.

1340
01:30:04,385 --> 01:30:06,806
Meaning death. I overcame it,
so they named me after it.

1341
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:08,540
And I've been spittin' at death
from behind

1342
01:30:08,610 --> 01:30:10,170
and putting "kick me" signs
on its back.

1343
01:30:10,241 --> 01:30:12,794
Because I am not the son
of sha clack clack.

1344
01:30:12,865 --> 01:30:15,102
I am before that.
I am before.

1345
01:30:15,201 --> 01:30:18,518
I am before before.
Before death is eternity.

1346
01:30:18,594 --> 01:30:20,023
After death is eternity.
There is no death.

1347
01:30:20,130 --> 01:30:23,261
There's only eternity.
And I be riding on the wings
of eternity like,

1348
01:30:23,330 --> 01:30:25,980
ya, ya, ya,
sha clack clack.

1349
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:27,479
But my flight doesn't go
undisturbed

1350
01:30:27,554 --> 01:30:31,166
because time makes dreams defer
and all of my time fears

1351
01:30:31,234 --> 01:30:32,478
are turning my days
into daymares.

1352
01:30:32,546 --> 01:30:36,191
And I live daymares reliving
nightmares that once haunted
my past sha clack clack.

1353
01:30:36,258 --> 01:30:37,338
Time is beatin' my ass.

1354
01:30:37,411 --> 01:30:39,964
And I be having dreams of
chocolate-covered watermelons

1355
01:30:40,035 --> 01:30:41,922
filled with fried chickens
like pinatas.

1356
01:30:41,987 --> 01:30:44,354
With little pickaninny sons and
daughters standing up under
them

1357
01:30:44,419 --> 01:30:45,979
with big sticks and aluminum foil,

1358
01:30:46,051 --> 01:30:49,019
hittin' them trying to catch
pieces of fallen fried chicken wings.

1359
01:30:49,091 --> 01:30:50,781
And Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben
are standing in the corners

1360
01:30:50,883 --> 01:30:53,054
with rifles pointing at the
heads of the little children.

1361
01:30:53,155 --> 01:30:54,584
"Don't shoot the children!"
I shout.

1362
01:30:54,692 --> 01:30:56,547
"Don't shoot the children!"
But they say,"It's too late.

1363
01:30:56,643 --> 01:30:58,269
They've already been infected
by time."

1364
01:30:58,339 --> 01:31:01,536
But this shit is before my time.
I need more time.

1365
01:31:01,604 --> 01:31:04,670
But it's too late.
They start shooting at the
children and killing them.

1366
01:31:04,740 --> 01:31:06,398
One by one, two by two,

1367
01:31:06,468 --> 01:31:07,995
three by three, four by four,

1368
01:31:08,068 --> 01:31:10,272
Five by five, six by six.

1369
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,057
But my spirit is growing
seven by seven.

1370
01:31:13,124 --> 01:31:14,783
Faster than the speed of light

1371
01:31:14,853 --> 01:31:18,235
because light only penetrates
the darkness that's already there.

1372
01:31:18,372 --> 01:31:20,991
And I'm already there.
I'm here at the end of the road,

1373
01:31:21,061 --> 01:31:22,948
which is the beginning of the
road beyond time.

1374
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:25,532
But where my niggas at?

1375
01:31:26,565 --> 01:31:29,315
Oh, shit. Don't tell me
my niggas got lost in time.

1376
01:31:31,525 --> 01:31:33,981
My niggas are dying
before their time.

1377
01:31:34,565 --> 01:31:38,209
My niggas are serving
unjust time.

1378
01:31:38,405 --> 01:31:41,601
My niggas are dying
because of time.

1379
01:32:22,343 --> 01:32:24,135
Look, um...

1380
01:32:24,135 --> 01:32:26,502
I just, uh...

1381
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:29,731
I just want to apologize
for what happened earlier.

1382
01:32:29,895 --> 01:32:32,710
I didn't, you know,
mean for it to get out of hand.

1383
01:32:34,695 --> 01:32:37,248
Look, no, no, look,

1384
01:32:37,352 --> 01:32:41,542
I just want to you know that,
um...

1385
01:32:41,608 --> 01:32:44,904
no matter what happens
on Monday...

1386
01:32:45,032 --> 01:32:47,656
no matter what you decide to do,

1387
01:32:47,656 --> 01:32:50,210
I'm gonna be here for you.

1388
01:32:52,488 --> 01:32:55,271
Go home and write your own
goddamn poems. Goddamn it.

1389
01:32:55,368 --> 01:32:58,216
You better get back out there.
Can't you hear them?

1390
01:32:58,313 --> 01:33:01,379
Just one more.

1391
01:33:02,313 --> 01:33:03,590
I need to get some air.

1392
01:33:05,289 --> 01:33:07,656
- Then you'll come back?
- Yeah.

1393
01:33:07,753 --> 01:33:13,089
Okay. Well, I'll hold the fort
down till you get back.

1394
01:33:13,546 --> 01:33:14,691
Thank you.
