We're looking at architectural drawings

85
00:03:21,464 --> 00:03:22,730
of a residential bunker

86
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:24,599

87
00:03:24,601 --> 00:03:26,420
used to build 'em for Saddam.

88
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,636
As you can see, the plans call

89
00:03:28,638 --> 00:03:30,738
for four barracks-style guardrooms

90
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,607
between two sets of blast doors.

91
00:03:32,609 --> 00:03:34,909
Behind the second door,
there's a utility closet

where he was planning to build.

101
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:54,629
Look, a guy works as a
fixer in that neighborhood,

102
00:03:54,631 --> 00:03:56,130
of course he's gonna have a fortress,
right?

103
00:03:56,132 --> 00:03:58,712
We don't think he was building
the place for himself.

00:04:16,886 --> 00:04:18,152
MANDY: You're looking at a limestone

113
00:04:18,154 --> 00:04:20,421
ridge in the Asir Mountains,

114
00:04:20,423 --> 00:04:24,258
about 50 miles northeast of Abha,
in Saudi Arabia.

115
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,327
We believe these shapes correspond

116
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,830
to the guard emplacements
on the architectural plan.

117
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:31,466
And that would mean that this line

118
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:33,868
would be the ramp down to
the exterior blast doors.

119

make a hit inside Saudi Arabia.

I'm sorry, that supplies

we import from the Persian Gulf.

Is there any chance you're gonna tell us

123
00:04:44,948 --> 00:04:46,347
that the Saudis are on-on board,

124
00:04:46,349 --> 00:04:48,116
th-they're gonna help
us with the snatch?

125
00:04:48,118 --> 00:04:49,517

126
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,019
our Saudi allies in this operation.

127
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:53,354
Well, they're not gonna
be our allies for long.

129
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:57,558
Not sure,
but we can't assume they aren't.

130
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,227
GARCIA: Needless to say,

131
00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,864
the diplomatic and economic
considerations are considerable.

132
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:04,599
But Hassan was Khalid Sheik Mohammed's

133
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:06,100
senior operational commander.

134
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:08,269
And he's still directing
al-Qaeda operations in Yemen.

135
00:05:08,271 --> 00:05:11,039
Makes him the biggest fish we've
gone after since bin Laden,

136
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:13,107
and now, we believe we know where he is.

137
00:05:13,109 --> 00:05:15,476
But to get DOD approval,
we need to demonstrate

138
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:18,880
an assault plan that doesn't
risk a geopolitical catastrophe.

I'm sorry, we're gonna "demonstrate"?

140
00:05:20,216 --> 00:05:21,616
We built a full-size replica

141

00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,834

153
00:05:48,645 --> 00:05:49,911
Last week, while you were in Africa,

154
00:05:49,913 --> 00:05:51,379
we got Charlie Team up and running.

155
00:05:51,381 --> 00:05:53,114
Chief Fuller's gonna be running
you through our operation

156
00:05:53,116 --> 00:05:54,382
as soon as our guests arrive.

157
00:05:54,384 --> 00:05:56,017
I'm sorry.
Is that our plan or your plan?

158
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,386
Because if we were involved
in this whole process,

159
00:05:58,388 --> 00:06:00,288
first thing we would do,
we'd get an intel brief,

160
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,457
then we would all put
our heads together...

161
00:06:02,459 --> 00:06:03,991
- Afraid there's no time for that.
- There's no time for that.

162
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:05,193
I'm confident Chief Fuller's plan

163
00:06:05,195 --> 00:06:06,594
will get us our green light.

164
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:08,129
Thank you, sir.
I'd say we've got a real shot,

165
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:10,531
assuming you fellas are able to keep up.

166
00:06:10,533 --> 00:06:14,035
(CHUCKLES) Wow. Garcia has a
comedian here, ladies and gentlemen.

167
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,241
Gentlemen, I'm not gonna mince words.

168
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,272
This has the potential to be

169
00:06:18,274 --> 00:06:19,874
the defining op of our lives.

170
00:06:19,876 --> 00:06:22,086
This is the one you'll
tell your grandkids about.

171
00:06:22,283 --> 00:06:24,879
Bottom line,
I simply cannot stress enough

172
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:27,582
the importance of
getting this one right.

173
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:29,617
Get your game faces on.

174
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:42,335
This is General Tinsdale from CENTCOM.

175
00:06:42,461 --> 00:06:44,499
Ms. Burgess from State.

176
00:06:44,974 --> 00:06:46,297
We want this op green-lit,

177
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,246
these are the people
we need to convince.

178
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:51,403
Now, as with all multi-team operations,

179
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:55,005
cooperation and communication
will be essential.

180
00:06:55,007 --> 00:06:58,041
Now, as you can see,
the exterior blast doors

181
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,143
are only approachable via the kill zone,

182
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,578
right between the two guard positions.

183
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:06,116
The door, 4,000 pounds of solid,
reinforced steel.

184
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:09,152
Far as what we can expect
to find behind that door,

185
00:07:09,154 --> 00:07:10,454
I'm gonna turn it over to Ms. Ellis.

186
00:07:10,456 --> 00:07:12,389
Hassan's bodyguard force consists

187
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:14,858
of a dozen or so of his
most loyal fighters.

188
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,994
These appear to be
their living quarters,

189
00:07:16,996 --> 00:07:19,596
past which,
we come to an interior blast door.

190
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,566
On the other side of that
should be our target,

191
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,105
Abu Hassan al-Qatal.

192
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:25,536
Chief Fuller will now run us through

193
00:07:25,538 --> 00:07:27,438
our current thinking for the infil.
Chief.

194
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,039
Thank you, sir.

195
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,641
We're looking at a direct helo assault.

196
00:07:30,643 --> 00:07:32,843
Quick and dirty land right on the "X."

197
00:07:32,845 --> 00:07:35,012
25 yards from the blast door.

198
00:07:35,014 --> 00:07:36,580
What we lose in surprise, we make up for

199
00:07:36,582 --> 00:07:38,048
in speed and violence of action.

200
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,516
RAY: Look, uh, listen, seriously.

201
00:07:39,518 --> 00:07:41,418
No offense, but we-we're not
talking Afghanistan here,

202
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,653
we're talking Saudi Air Defense.

203
00:07:42,655 --> 00:07:44,254
What's the alternative?

204
00:07:44,256 --> 00:07:46,557
- A low vis drive in, drive out?
- It'd be a lot quieter.

205
00:07:46,559 --> 00:07:48,258
BEAU: Yeah, more risky.

206
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,727
Look,
we have to assume we'll be compromised

207
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:51,428
as soon as we hit the guards, anyway.

208
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,731
At most,
the helo gives the Saudis another, what,

209
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,100
90 seconds more warning?

210
00:07:56,102 --> 00:07:57,634
Mandy, nearest Saudi force, how close?

211
00:07:57,636 --> 00:07:58,669
Oh, here.

212
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:00,838
Eight klicks east of the target,

213
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,073
special police battalion in Tabab.

214
00:08:03,075 --> 00:08:05,843
We estimate the minimum
response time is 14 minutes.

215
00:08:05,845 --> 00:08:07,945
Chief Fuller. I trust you understand

216
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:09,480
that we cannot engage the Saudis

217
00:08:09,482 --> 00:08:11,381
- under any circumstances.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

218
00:08:11,383 --> 00:08:13,617
We are aware, but we feel
comfortable with that margin.

219
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,819
Some of us do.

220
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,688
SONNY: If we engage the Saudis,

221
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,256
it's gonna get ugly real quick.

222
00:08:19,258 --> 00:08:20,424
Again,

223
00:08:20,426 --> 00:08:23,160
under no circumstances
can we cause damage

224
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:25,562
or injury to any local forces.

225
00:08:25,564 --> 00:08:27,965
Bottom line, however we do this,
we got to be gone 14 minutes

226
00:08:27,967 --> 00:08:30,000
after our friends in Tabab get the call.

227
00:08:30,002 --> 00:08:32,136
Further demonstrate
our actions on target,

228
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,171
I suggest we move to the full-size mock.

229
00:08:34,173 --> 00:08:35,973
I'll have some
refreshments brought down.

230
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:37,608
- If you'll please follow me.
- Showtime.

231
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,976
WOMAN: Mmm, refreshments.

232
00:08:41,247 --> 00:08:43,413
Yeah,
so I never knew you to buck for rank.

233
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:44,782
That what I'm doing?

234
00:08:44,784 --> 00:08:46,250
Oh, come on.
I know you know how many team leaders

235
00:08:46,252 --> 00:08:48,051
there are for every troop chief slot.

236
00:08:48,053 --> 00:08:49,486
Preacher's getting close to retirement,

237
00:08:49,488 --> 00:08:50,721
you want to take his place.

238
00:08:50,723 --> 00:08:51,989
Figure it's not a bad idea

239
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,091
to show up the competition
in front of Command, right?

240
00:08:54,093 --> 00:08:55,359
Wow, you know what?

241
00:08:55,361 --> 00:08:57,261
- That never crossed my mind.
- Yeah.

242
00:08:57,263 --> 00:08:59,263
That's what... well,
there's a difference between me and you.

243
00:08:59,265 --> 00:09:01,064
- Oh, that's just one of many.
- Yeah.

244
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:02,332
I guess so.

245
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:05,836
You want to tell me what that was about?

246
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:08,238
History, man. A lot of history.

247
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,840
Want to catch me up?

248
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,909
- On Beau and Jason?
- Yeah.

249
00:09:11,911 --> 00:09:13,310
They went through Green Team together.

250
00:09:13,312 --> 00:09:14,878
And Jason made team leader first.

251
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,013
So much for the brotherhood.

252
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:17,948
Come on, now,
who fights more than brothers?

253
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:19,183
Plus,

254
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:20,484
now, there's always,

255
00:09:20,486 --> 00:09:22,119
"How many black team
leaders does it take

256
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:23,353
to screw in a light bulb?"

257
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:24,388
I'm not gonna touch that one.

258
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,923
- Both of them.
- Ugh.

259
00:09:25,925 --> 00:09:27,925
I'm just saying,
I'm sure it hasn't been easy for him.

260
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:28,992
I can imagine.

261
00:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,828
But that does not excuse the fact

262
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:34,198
that he is a little bit of a dick.

263
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,732
CLAY: You done a lot of these?

264
00:09:35,734 --> 00:09:37,401
ADAM: Next-of-kin notifications?

265
00:09:37,403 --> 00:09:38,602
Done four.

266
00:09:38,604 --> 00:09:42,673
I guess I could tell you it gets easier,
but, uh...

267
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:44,775
So what do you say?

268
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,826
(CAR ALARM CHIRPS) Ah,
you're overthinking.

269
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:50,480
There's no predicting what
a parent'll want to hear.

270
00:09:51,309 --> 00:09:54,551
Only thing you can do is go in,
make the best of it.

271
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,521
"You never really know
what's behind the door

272
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:58,856
until you breach it."

273
00:10:02,262 --> 00:10:04,848
ADAM: <i>How much you, uh,
know about Brian's family?</i>

274
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,664
Just what he told me.

275
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:11,365
Their dad sells insurance,
mom's a librarian.

276
00:10:11,615 --> 00:10:15,739
Cul-de-sac, white picket fence,
swing in the yard.

277
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,211
I guess someone's got to have that life.

278
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,645
You know where we're going?

279
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,648
Uh, yeah, got an address for his mom.

280
00:10:25,132 --> 00:10:27,951
Lucy Denise, 113 High Street.

281
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:36,727
There, uh, is there any chance
you want to do all the talking?

282
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:40,264
JASON: <i>Hope they like the show.</i>

283
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,065
As long as they leave some
refreshments for the rest of us.

284
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,301
A shame we can't afford to build
one of these ahead of every hit.

285
00:10:44,303 --> 00:10:46,041
BEAU: To continue...

286
00:10:48,612 --> 00:10:52,276
However we infil, this is the
first door we have to breach.

287
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:54,578
Once we're on target,
Charlie Team will engage both guards,

288
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,013
then be primary to the breach.

289
00:10:56,015 --> 00:10:57,481
- Naturally.
- Bravo will

290
00:10:57,483 --> 00:10:59,416
hang back to provide overwatch and,
if necessary,

291
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,617
support by fire.

292
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,752
Wow, keeping us really safe.

293
00:11:01,754 --> 00:11:03,387
That's very thoughtful of you.

294
00:11:03,389 --> 00:11:05,313
Well,
we'll try to leave something for you.

295
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,991
As I was saying,
after we breach and make entry,

296
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,460
half of Bravo Team stays outside
to maintain rear security,

297
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:12,496
rest of Bravo falls on Charlie
to clear the structure.

298
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:14,498
So, not only is Bravo Team split,

299
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,967
but half of it is now with Charlie Team?

300
00:11:16,969 --> 00:11:18,769
BEAU: Yeah, don't worry about it.
I'll take good care of 'em.

301
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:20,003
Really?
Because, you know what, in my book,

302
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:21,338
I don't think you
should split the teams.

303
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,673
BEAU: So what? You worried your scouts

304
00:11:22,675 --> 00:11:23,907
can't handle being away

305
00:11:23,909 --> 00:11:26,343
- from their scout leader?
- (CHUCKLES): Oh. Right. Scouts.

306
00:11:26,345 --> 00:11:28,178
All right.
Once we're through the blast door,

307
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,780
we move on to the next stage

308
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:32,665
of our presentation.
If you'll follow me, please.

309
00:11:33,127 --> 00:11:35,385
JASON: This just keeps getting better.

310
00:11:35,387 --> 00:11:37,187
This is the area where we're most likely

311
00:11:37,189 --> 00:11:38,789
to encounter resistance,

312
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:40,090
the second blast door.

313
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:41,425
We clear this section,

314
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,093
get set to blow the internal blast door,

315
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:44,294
we figure we still got

316
00:11:44,296 --> 00:11:45,862
eight minutes to get
in and out with Hassan.

317
00:11:45,864 --> 00:11:48,632
- Another explosive breach?
- Why not?

318
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:51,094
How many noncombatants do we have
on the other side of that door?

319
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:53,739
Hassan has three wives, six children.

320
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:55,405
A couple lieutenants have families.

321
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,240
We have no idea

322
00:11:57,242 --> 00:11:59,242
what kind of security
Hassan'll have in there.

323
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,111
I mean, could be half-dozen guys
in S-vests behind this door.

324
00:12:01,113 --> 00:12:03,246
I want 'em on their knees,
seeing stars when we come through.

325
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:04,748
RAY: Could also be a bunch of kids.

326
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,117
Or there could not be. Rules of
engagement say, unless we see them,

327
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,936
we have no obligation to assume they're
there.

328
00:12:09,015 --> 00:12:10,401
JASON: Or there could be.

329
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,222
I don't know about you,
but I really don't want to see

330
00:12:12,224 --> 00:12:14,324
half a dozen kids dead on CNN.

331
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:16,927
TINSDALE: I believe I have a solution.

332
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:19,262
See, I was concerned
about the children myself,

333
00:12:19,264 --> 00:12:20,998
thought we might find a way

334
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,533
to distract them, keep them busy,
out of harm's way.

335
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,102
So I had my staff pull stats

336
00:12:25,104 --> 00:12:28,005
on the most popular
candies in Saudi Arabia.

337
00:12:28,007 --> 00:12:30,807
The Galaxy bar seems to be
a consistent top seller.

338
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,444
Figure if we issue each
operator a dozen or so,

339
00:12:34,446 --> 00:12:37,427
you can pass 'em out whenever
you come across the children.

340
00:12:37,651 --> 00:12:38,682
That's good thinking, sir.

341
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:40,717
SONNY: Good-Idea Fairies drive
all the way down here from D.C.

342
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:42,019
to break our balls in person?

343
00:12:42,021 --> 00:12:44,187
No matter how popular the candy is, sir,

344
00:12:44,189 --> 00:12:45,989
we're not gonna be able to
have that option till we get

345
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:46,790
through that door.

346
00:12:46,851 --> 00:12:49,126
Yeah, and we're not gonna be able to get
through that door unless we blow it.

347
00:12:49,128 --> 00:12:50,160
No, we cut it.

348
00:12:50,162 --> 00:12:51,762
We don't have time to cut it.

349
00:12:51,764 --> 00:12:53,397
How much time's that gonna cost us?

350
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,098
Let's see, four-inch tempered steel?

351
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,000
Take the Broco torch two, three minutes.

352
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,935
Doesn't seem to leave a lot of
time to get you all back out

353
00:12:58,937 --> 00:13:01,238
- before the Saudis arrive.
- Look, the torch

354
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,173
is too slow. We got to blow it.

355
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:04,541
JASON: Sir, I'm confident my guys

356
00:13:04,543 --> 00:13:06,243
can make initial assault,
get to this door,

357
00:13:06,245 --> 00:13:09,135
have plenty of time to burn it,
secure HVT,

358
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:12,015
and make exfil without
killing noncombatants

359
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,673
on the other side of that door.

360
00:13:13,887 --> 00:13:15,052
You got two minutes.

361
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:16,420
We'll run it with the torch.

362
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,288
Let's do this.

363
00:13:22,149 --> 00:13:23,894
ADAM: <i>Maybe Brian got the address wrong.</i>

364
00:13:23,896 --> 00:13:25,395
His mom's name is Lucy Denise.

365
00:13:25,397 --> 00:13:27,904
Maybe she owns the place.

366
00:13:28,534 --> 00:13:31,068
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

367
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,335
Excuse me.

368
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:35,005
Any chance you know
somebody called Lucy Denise?

369
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:38,208
Is this some kind of joke?

370
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,643
Not that we know of.

371
00:13:39,645 --> 00:13:42,512
How-how is it a joke, Lucy Denise?

372
00:13:42,514 --> 00:13:44,815
Well, place is called Lucy's.

373
00:13:44,817 --> 00:13:46,750
Been here going on 40 years.

374
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,086
One of the waitresses been
here almost that long.

375
00:13:49,088 --> 00:13:50,887
Name's Denise.

376
00:13:51,975 --> 00:13:54,391
DENISE: <i>So, that thing where
cops are required to admit</i>

377
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,326
who they are,
you ask 'em straight out...

378
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:58,571
That's just in the movies, right?

379
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:00,931
- Uh, as we said, ma'am...
- Yeah, yeah.

380
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:03,681
You're with the navy. I remember.

381
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:06,670
"Lucy Denise," huh? Well,

382
00:14:06,672 --> 00:14:07,971
guess that's me.

383
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,073
Oh, unless she's wanted for something

384
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:11,408
or she owes you money. In that case,

385
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,511
I have never heard of her. (CHUCKLES)

386
00:14:14,513 --> 00:14:15,812
Well, you found me.

387
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:18,281
So, you want to tell me
now why you're looking?

388
00:14:18,283 --> 00:14:20,016
Brian Armstrong.

389
00:14:20,412 --> 00:14:22,226
You know him?

390
00:14:22,441 --> 00:14:23,386
CLAY: I swear, ma'am, we're not...

391
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:25,937
we're not trying to jam anybody up here,
okay?

392
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:27,791
Brian...

393
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,944
Brian is a friend.

394
00:14:31,824 --> 00:14:34,698
Brian's mom used to use this
place as free babysitting.

395
00:14:35,435 --> 00:14:37,767
She'd drop Brian off
whenever she was out doing...

396
00:14:37,769 --> 00:14:39,503
whatever it was she was doing.

397
00:14:39,505 --> 00:14:43,054
He'd sit in a corner booth
with a stack of books.

398
00:14:43,351 --> 00:14:45,008
Would never drink a soda though,

399
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,277
no matter how many times we offered.

400
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,963
Strictly water or milk.

401
00:14:50,227 --> 00:14:51,481
Do you, uh... do you have any idea

402
00:14:51,483 --> 00:14:53,886
where we might be able to find his mom?

403
00:14:54,546 --> 00:14:56,525
Oh, she passed away.

404
00:14:56,954 --> 00:14:59,222
Brian couldn't have
been more than eight,

405
00:14:59,224 --> 00:15:02,092
nine. Went to live with his dad.

406
00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:04,261
Use some coffee?

407
00:15:04,263 --> 00:15:05,795
Yeah. We both could.

408
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,430
Long flight.

409
00:15:07,432 --> 00:15:09,444
Well, have a seat over there.

410
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,604
That's where Brian used to sit.

411
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,937
I'll go fetch you some fresh.

412

00:18:28,364 --> 00:18:31,766
We're-we're looking for a man named,
uh, Samuel Armstrong.

479
00:18:31,768 --> 00:18:34,001
- Any chance that rings a bell?
- Friends of his?

480
00:18:34,003 --> 00:18:35,569
His son, Brian.

481
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:38,706
Good. Sammy was a son of a bitch.

482
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:40,908
The boy was a good egg, though.

483
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,444
Used to wonder about him sometimes,
what happened to him.

484
00:18:43,446 --> 00:18:45,646
He join the Navy?

485
00:18:45,648 --> 00:18:48,349
I hope you all can keep him
from turning into his old man.

486
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:50,959
You happen to know where Samuel
went after he left here?

487
00:18:50,975 --> 00:18:53,354
Sure. Son of a bitch finally got himself

488
00:18:53,356 --> 00:18:54,955
sent up to the penitentiary

489
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:57,191
- in Salinas.
- Salinas.

490
00:18:57,193 --> 00:18:59,326
- He still there?
- No idea.

491
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:01,996
Child Services shipped the
boy off to a state home.

492
00:19:01,998 --> 00:19:03,497
Never heard from either one of
'em again.

Why have I been
undermining you this whole time?

Because you have one tool
that you use for every job.

- Yeah, it is also my opinion

that you devised a plan that
would kill innocent people.

I don't, okay? I was a 3IC back then.

587
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,944
Okay. All right, well,
let me ask you something.

588

You ever consider the color of my skin?

It is not about that,
do you understand me?

591

Yeah,
but this particular jackass is black.

with no sense of humor,

597
00:24:50,063 --> 00:24:51,662
and he won't think outside the box.

598
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,531
I get it. He drives you crazy.

599

Good. I'm glad that we see the same way.

600

side-by-side on the beach,

salt and sand.

614

Every time a wave comes in,

615

everybody's trying to cheat, right?

616
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,631
Keep their head up

go back in your nose.

you to get back down.

620
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:36,207
it's hard to tell one
white face from another.

621
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:38,909

they call out by name?

622
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,377

head back down in that sand!"

624

you're a great operator.

625

No, you chose me because
I was the<i> best</i> operator.

626
00:25:49,627 --> 00:25:51,655
It's what you're not understanding,
brother.

627
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:54,178
For me, for Beau,
being great's not good enough.

628
00:25:54,458 --> 00:25:56,093
You go outside the box,

629
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:58,028
you're innovative, a self-starter.

630
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:00,664
If we do it, we can't follow the rules.

631
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm not saying that excuses
the way Beau is at all.

632
00:26:03,102 --> 00:26:04,235
I'm just saying it's something

633
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:05,636
you ought to at least take into account.

634
00:26:09,646 --> 00:26:10,908
Got it, man. I got it, all right?

635
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,843
Look, I appreciate you talking to me,

636
00:26:12,845 --> 00:26:14,945
but did you hear what
he said about Nate?

637
00:26:14,947 --> 00:26:16,918
You know what? You were actually
the one who brought up Nate.

638
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:19,583
Really? Somebody gets killed
'cause I can't stick to the script?

639
00:26:19,585 --> 00:26:21,218
You don't think that's what he meant?

640
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,820
You know what I think? (SIGHS)

641
00:26:22,822 --> 00:26:25,022
I think Nate's death has been
eating at you for months now,

642
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:26,624
and I think it's time you
talked to somebody about it

643
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:27,892
'cause it's not going away.

644
00:26:27,894 --> 00:26:30,227
Therapy. Therapy...
Yeah, that's never gonna happen.

645
00:26:30,229 --> 00:26:32,433
Maybe not a shrink, necessarily.

646
00:26:34,181 --> 00:26:36,867
But me, Alana, somebody.

647
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:39,436
- That's not what we do, Ray.
- Yeah?

648
00:26:39,438 --> 00:26:41,639
Well, we also don't get into
scraps in front of the brass

649
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,973
and risk getting bounced out of command.

650
00:26:42,975 --> 00:26:44,842
Look, how many friends have we lost?

651
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:46,076
We never talk about them.

652
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:47,711
Why is Nate so different?

653
00:26:47,713 --> 00:26:50,237
You know what? Honestly,
I really don't care about the why.

654
00:26:50,748 --> 00:26:53,436
All I care about is
figuring out how to fix it.

655
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:56,489
I told Naima we got scrapped.

656
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:59,210
She's making lunch.

657
00:26:59,837 --> 00:27:00,791
You hungry?

658
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:01,959
No. I'm good. I'm fine.

659
00:27:01,961 --> 00:27:03,531
I got something I got to do.

660
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:05,696
Somewhere I need to be, okay?

661
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,462
- I'm good.
- Okay.

662
00:27:08,577 --> 00:27:10,201
Yeah.

663
00:27:21,813 --> 00:27:23,579
Hey, Pete.

664
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:24,710
What's going on?

665
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,798
Thanks for coming by, man.

666
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,284
Well, after all we've been through,

667
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:28,885
hard to see turning
you down for a drink.

668
00:27:28,887 --> 00:27:30,654
Man, it's a little thick in here,
isn't it?

669
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:31,955
Yeah, probably the AC's broken.

670
00:27:31,957 --> 00:27:33,430
Well, you want to go somewhere else?

671
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:34,758
Hell, no. Drink in the heat.

672
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,927
- Let's pretend we're back in Kabul.
- Hey, what can I get you?

673
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:39,496
Can I get a beer and a shot of tequila?
You in?

674
00:27:39,498 --> 00:27:41,698
- Yeah, make it two.
- Got it. Okay.

675
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,500
How long you been back in Virginia?

676
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:45,769
Oh, a couple months.

677
00:27:45,771 --> 00:27:47,471
Sorry about Nate.

678
00:27:47,473 --> 00:27:49,406
Yeah, I wanted to get
back for the funeral. I...

679
00:27:49,408 --> 00:27:52,142
had to stay in JBad, finish a contract.

680
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:53,561
Yeah.

681
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,084
Um...

682
00:27:58,217 --> 00:28:00,450
(INDISTINCT CHATTER,
POOL BALLS CLICKING)

683
00:28:00,452 --> 00:28:01,985
Where'd you get that?

684
00:28:01,987 --> 00:28:03,787
Found that in Nate's burn box.

685
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:06,084
What do you know about her?

686
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:09,459
Marjan.
You know that 'terp that you had,

687
00:28:09,461 --> 00:28:11,543
the one that disappeared?
That's his wife.

688
00:28:12,186 --> 00:28:13,130
Oh, yeah, I know that.

689
00:28:13,132 --> 00:28:15,465
Well, after her husband disappeared,

690
00:28:15,467 --> 00:28:16,900
she assumed he was
picked up by the Taliban,

691
00:28:16,902 --> 00:28:18,731
thought she was next.

692
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:20,137
- Right.
- Here you go.

693
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,939
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

694
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,311
Thanks.

695
00:28:29,782 --> 00:28:31,215
So...

696
00:28:32,979 --> 00:28:35,419
she comes to you, right?

697
00:28:35,907 --> 00:28:38,288
And she asks you to get
her out of Afghanistan.

698
00:28:38,512 --> 00:28:40,357
Nate knew I had contacts at the border.

699
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,491
Right.

700
00:28:41,493 --> 00:28:43,126
How'd she get to Virginia?

701
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:46,096
Bad idea, Pete.

702
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:47,798
Well, what was I gonna do? Say no?

703
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,065
You know what I owed Nate.

704
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:51,334
(SIGHS)

705
00:28:51,336 --> 00:28:53,069
Anybody else know about her?

706
00:28:53,071 --> 00:28:54,932
No, just my guys.

707
00:28:55,427 --> 00:28:56,873
Now what are you worried about?

708
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,408
You think the DOD'd go
after Molly's pension?

709
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,410
All it takes is one cake-eater

710
00:29:00,412 --> 00:29:02,600
to make an example out of somebody, man.

711
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:05,682
Must be nice, you know? Be an officer,

712
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:08,051
seeing everything from 30,000
feet where it all makes sense.

713
00:29:08,053 --> 00:29:09,352
Never having to be on the ground,

714
00:29:09,354 --> 00:29:12,022
see where people live,
how messy it gets.

715
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:18,895
Right. On the ground where people live,

716
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,364
sweat.

717
00:29:21,366 --> 00:29:23,066
Especially in the desert.

718
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,404
Thanks, Pete.

719
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,973
Thank you all for coming
back at this late hour.

720
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:31,608
On a hunch, Jason asked me

721
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,443
to check the thermal
imaging of the compound,

722
00:29:33,445 --> 00:29:35,011
and we discovered that

723
00:29:35,013 --> 00:29:37,147
because the German
design firm didn't know

724
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:39,149
where this bunker would be constructed,

725
00:29:39,151 --> 00:29:40,917
there were unable to anticipate

726
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:43,186
the challenges particular
to the desert environment.

727
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:46,490
The extreme heat of the location
appears to have forced Hassan

728
00:29:46,492 --> 00:29:48,124
to install a pair

729
00:29:48,126 --> 00:29:50,927
of AC ducts that don't appear

730
00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:52,996
on the plans we used
to design our models.

731
00:29:52,998 --> 00:29:55,065
Our analysis of the
imagery suggests that

732
00:29:55,067 --> 00:29:56,366
two vertical ducts were drilled

733
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,034
directly into the limestone cliffs,

734
00:29:58,036 --> 00:30:01,071
and connect to horizontal
ducts inside the compound,

735
00:30:01,073 --> 00:30:03,306
and therefore,
lack the secure countermeasures

736
00:30:03,308 --> 00:30:05,242
of the rest of the bunker's vent system.

737
00:30:05,244 --> 00:30:07,377
So, by dropping through the air ducts,

738
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:09,613
we bypass all sentries and blast doors,

739
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:11,948
arriving here without alerting anyone

740
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,283
to our presence.

741
00:30:13,285 --> 00:30:15,318
Easy to beat the clock
if it never starts.

742
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,153
- That's right.
- GARCIA: How big are the ducts?

743
00:30:17,155 --> 00:30:18,955
MANDY:
We estimate three feet by three feet.

744
00:30:18,957 --> 00:30:20,757
Crawl a few hundred
feet with all that gear?

745
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:23,260
- It's gonna be tight.
- Nobody said it was gonna be easy.

746
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:24,628
TINSDALE: What about the exfil?

747
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,229
I hope you're not planning
to climb back up that rope

748
00:30:26,231 --> 00:30:27,264
with your prisoner.

749
00:30:27,266 --> 00:30:29,966
Well, once we secure the package inside,

750
00:30:29,968 --> 00:30:31,501
we will communicate with Charlie Team,

751
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:34,204
they will clear inward
as we clear outward.

752
00:30:34,206 --> 00:30:36,940
We'll open the interior blast
door and exfil together.

753
00:30:36,942 --> 00:30:37,874
Chief Fuller,

754
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,943
any objections?

755
00:30:44,615 --> 00:30:47,098
Well, that's damn right
it ain't gonna be easy.

756
00:30:49,454 --> 00:30:51,521
But at least this way it's possible.

757
00:30:51,523 --> 00:30:53,256
I say we give it a shot.

758
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,322
Yeah, we'll give it a shot.

759
00:30:58,691 --> 00:31:00,964
EMORY: <i>Some of the children
are only with us a few weeks.</i>

760
00:31:00,966 --> 00:31:03,633
Just long enough for their
parents to get clean,

761
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:06,369
or get their act together
enough to regain custody.

762
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:08,204
A lot of them end up coming back.

763
00:31:08,206 --> 00:31:09,606
Any ever get adopted out?

764
00:31:09,608 --> 00:31:10,807
EMORY: Uh, once in a while.

765
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,609
Mostly the younger ones.

766
00:31:12,611 --> 00:31:15,645
Couples in the market for
a little bundle of joy

767
00:31:15,647 --> 00:31:17,380
to jazz up the Christmas card

768
00:31:17,382 --> 00:31:20,717
aren't real eager to
bring a surly teenager

769
00:31:20,719 --> 00:31:23,086
into their home,
doesn't even share their DNA.

770
00:31:23,088 --> 00:31:25,755
Most part,
you're here after your tenth birthday,

771
00:31:25,757 --> 00:31:28,091
you're here for the duration.

772
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:31,561
CLAY: (CLEARS THROAT) What about, uh,

773
00:31:31,563 --> 00:31:32,896
what about foster care?

774
00:31:32,898 --> 00:31:33,997
That's a dice roll.

775
00:31:33,999 --> 00:31:35,231
Department does what they can

776
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:38,034
on their budget, but never weed out

777
00:31:38,036 --> 00:31:40,136
all the crazies,
entrepreneurs in it for the check.

778
00:31:40,138 --> 00:31:42,439
You ask me, kids are better off with us.

779
00:31:42,441 --> 00:31:45,375
At least here, they know they're safe.

780
00:31:45,377 --> 00:31:47,077
Our "library."

781
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:51,348
Obviously,
no one's giving us money for books.

782
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,149
Barely give us enough for food.

783
00:31:53,151 --> 00:31:55,852
So, the older kids leave
theirs here when they move out.

784
00:31:55,854 --> 00:31:58,888
Uh, Brian's dad, we called Salinas...
place he did time...

785
00:31:58,890 --> 00:32:00,991
But they had no idea where he
might've gone after he got out.

786
00:32:00,993 --> 00:32:02,459
Any chance you got
some records somewhere

787
00:32:02,461 --> 00:32:03,593
might help us find him?

788
00:32:03,595 --> 00:32:04,594
Uh, I can check.

789
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:06,375
You want to come back to the office?

790
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:54,811
You, uh... haven't asked

791
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:56,846
what I found out about Brian's dad.

792
00:32:57,946 --> 00:32:59,683
I figured nothing.
Otherwise you would've told me.

793
00:32:59,685 --> 00:33:01,384

for a few months, and...

816

I was about six

when she sent me to
live with her parents.
