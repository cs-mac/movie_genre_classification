1
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,373
This hallowed home of ours...

2
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,184
we hold sacred

3
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,556
Here we dreamt our dreams

4
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:13,388
Like a prayer in a temple

5
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,166
Like a ray from the skies

6
00:02:16,603 --> 00:02:19,163
Here we find succor

7
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:23,375
We sing to the glory of our Lord

8
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,976
"Unto to Redeemer of His flock,
we pray"

9
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,447
You won't get this

10
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:53,519
Lord, take care of Ma.
Take care of Om and Jagadish too

11
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,571
9:30. Get to the factory.
10:30. Cassette distribution meeting

12
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,566
11 am meeting with Rehman.
Agenda, piracy

13
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,241
2pm. Recording the new album
3:30pm. Shekhar

14
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,983
Put my agenda on that list.
Got to find a girl for you

15
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:26,522
Ma, there's a time for everything.
It'll happen in it's own time

16
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,325
At times, one must take
the initiative...

17
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,995
and in yesterday's newspapers
I have placed an advertisement...

18
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,165
along with our phone numbers

19
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,963
Looks like the calls are coming in.
Not my call, Not yet

20
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:44,905
Yes Saraswati Batra speaking.
Three daughters?

21
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:49,575
They have taken computer courses?
Floral arrangements too?

22
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,883
Wonderful!
Fair

23
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:54,586
Great!
Tall

24
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:02,355
Gulmohar Villa on Juhu beach?
That huge old mansion?

25
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,957
Grand!
- I see. Let's talk later

26
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:09,291
Why don't you use this car?
I will, of course I will

27
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:12,637
When?
All in good time

28
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:22,571
Namaste, sir. (Greeting)
How are you Ramprasad?

29
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,143
To that usual everyday question
I usually lie everyday

30
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,386
You lie?
About being fine

31
00:06:28,654 --> 00:06:30,178
You aren't fine

32
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:33,391
How could I?
I want to become a singer

33
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:39,164
I took up the liftman's job here
in hope that you'd notice me someday

34
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:42,361
I sing extremely well.
Would you like to hear...?

35
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:45,394
Not now.
Only in-between floors

36
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,962
That was folk,
but I can change it to rap

37
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,902
Let's talk later

38
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,644
I told you. Try to understand.
I'll try to put in a word

39
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:35,153
Mr Om, why did you lodge
a police complaint? He's a poor guy

40
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:43,659
Because you are a traitor
who pirates my music

41
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:51,059
So what's wrong? It's only business.
If I make a few cents pirating...

42
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:54,569
I can spare a bit for you too.
Fast-forward your life, Mr Om

43
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,307
Don't you ever step into
this office.

44
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,306
Peace Mr Om, peace

45
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:03,106
Let me know if you ever need me

46
00:08:03,449 --> 00:08:05,644
It's a treacherous world
and I'm honest

47
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,729
Like that, Shekhar?

48
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:34,974
These KK-Mix guys are trying to
pass off a re-mixed old number

49
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,789
This song isn't working

50
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:24,396
Shekhar, he says KK's mix
won't work!

51
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,127
Better give him on anotherjob

52
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,360
What's wrong with my number?
Not one, several

53
00:09:33,606 --> 00:09:36,837
The original is a classic.
And you...

54
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,437
Rape...?

55
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:44,181
I have raped so many songs but
all my rapes are super-duper hits

56
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,248
My liftman can sing better

57
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,861
Then call your liftman

58
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,905
Yes sir?
- Here's the moment...

59
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:21,010
you've awaited all your life.
If you can sing today...

60
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,754
you'll be singing
for the rest of your life

61
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:49,243
This is an insult to KK-Mix!
I have mixed a superhit

62
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,630
Om, you have proved
your marketing genius

63
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,976
Ramprasad is transformed into
the latest singing sensation RP

64
00:11:56,749 --> 00:12:00,310
All this my friend,
by dint of money

65
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,580
Not because of money. He's capable

66
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:12,987
Oh yes, I know your philosophy.
Love is mightier than money

67
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:18,964
But love cannot beget you money;
yet money can buy love

68
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:24,373
That's why my family is with me
and that's why you're a loner

69
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:30,982
You are with me.
Because of Love, Not for money

70
00:12:36,055 --> 00:12:37,989
How's Jai?

71
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:43,995
I hope he gets his degree
and settles down

72
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,031
Come in with the chequebook

73
00:12:49,802 --> 00:12:53,465
We've been childhood friends.
Don't hesitate about money...

74
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,571
if it concerns Jai's education.
He's my brother too

75
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,046
Please sign there

76
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:12,785
Here's a million. ForJai.
Repayable when able

77
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,565
You have taken God's place for me
on earth

78
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:41,047
How's Jagadish?
- Jagadish? Oh, he's fine

79
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:45,655
I'm sure he's going to make it bigger
than Jai, despite his education here

80
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,854
He's so fast!

81
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:51,858
Not even I can catch up with him.
He wants to outpace time

82
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:09,497
You'll know more once the principal
has noted your attendance record

83
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,376
Do you know how many classes
you attended this semester?

84
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,672
What a brilliant record!

85
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:28,919
You will see the principal
at nine am tomorrow

86
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:38,195
Stop going around with that bunch.
- I'll try to, sir

87
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:47,034
Jags! I'm dead! Dad will kill me!
Why...?

88
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,703
Only you can do something!

89
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,513
We'll see tomorrow

90
00:17:00,652 --> 00:17:03,052
Where are you going?
To class

91
00:17:17,636 --> 00:17:20,537
Latest printout
of the class attendance

92
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,030
Something's wrong with the computer!
Who got the printout? You or I...?

93
00:18:01,613 --> 00:18:06,312
Jags! Guess what happened?
- My attendance is 90 percent

94
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:13,987
Never mind and pay up
the internet cafe. 150 bucks

95
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,988
You took pocket money five days ago.
Pay your obeisances

96
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,806
Hold on... here's a fifty

97
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,315
Also keep this coin

98
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,821
What do I do with this buck?
Son, that coin...

99
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:47,024
was the first token your father
placed at our shrine

100
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:52,658
You're always running out of money.
Keep the coin. It augur well for you

101
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,568
Good-luck coin...?
Yes

102
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,770
Hi Jai! How are you?

103
00:19:14,186 --> 00:19:16,882
How is Om? How is Ma?

104
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,092
She must be standing right there
to hear my letter

105
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,725
Stop chattering. Read on

106
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,766
America is a great country.
People here are very hard-working

107
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,441
This is a land full of opportunities
if you want to make it in life

108
00:19:47,786 --> 00:19:52,382
All I miss are Ma's love
and home-cooked food

109
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:59,122
Tell Ma that my taste buds are always
tingling to memories of her dishes

110
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:08,998
Jags, take a look, is Ma in tears?
Is she wiping her tears?

111
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,038
If it's evening now,
Om must've changed into casuals

112
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:21,047
Yes Ma...

113
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,253
Om... Jai sends you his regards.
May he be happy

114
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:31,055
Anyway Jags, I can't write anymore.
Any more of this and I'll cry

115
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:35,456
Take care of yourself.
My regards to everyone

116
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,302
Jagadish, tell him
I'll mail him his money soon

117
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:05,085
What else did Jai write?
Ma, the letter is over

118
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,572
Are you forgetting something...?
Om... girl... wedding...?

119
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:19,108
Come on

120
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:25,512
Son, you won't refuse me, will you?
Refuse what, Ma?

121
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:29,850
I have chosen a girl for you.
What...?

122
00:21:30,389 --> 00:21:32,220
No refusing

123
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:36,788
She will see you tomorrow
at the club

124
00:21:36,995 --> 00:21:38,929
You will see her, won't you?

125
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,576
After my life

126
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:12,630
Isn't he looking cute?

127
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,635
Give me that hand

128
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,574
What are you upto, Ma?

129
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,630
Are you here to see Shanti?
Yes

130
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,047
Ma ends up choosing this one for me?

131
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,593
I was shocked
when I heard your name

132
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:27,435
You too aren't what
your name suggests (Shanti: Peace)

133
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,638
What to do?
God paired us off, did He?

134
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:46,054
That's a colourful dress

135
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:50,922
You look like a movie hero

136
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:57,667
I wanted to wear a suit. But little
brotherJagadish forced me into this

137
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:05,100
We're three of us. Jai is the other
brother. He's studying in America

138
00:24:06,578 --> 00:24:09,046
Om-Jai-Jagadish!
It's like a prayer

139
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,374
Our photo

140
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:16,987
When we were kids

141
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:20,987
Have you ever fallen in love
at first sight?

142
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:33,170
I have just chosen my mate for life!
And his name is Om

143
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:35,439
What are you doing, Shanti?

144
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:40,508
He promotes new singers

145
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,709
So I think I'll sing for him

146
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:52,723
I tell you, I love you

147
00:24:53,525 --> 00:24:56,050
What have I landed myself in?
So horribly out of tune

148
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:08,139
Now I'd like to hear Om saying that
to me in front of everyone

149
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,717
If I must, I must

150
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:35,722
How do you feel?
I feel like a scapegoat

151
00:25:45,577 --> 00:25:48,774
I welcome students
from all over the country...

152
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,514
who are participating
in this finale of...

153
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:56,446
Best of Best
Generation Next

154
00:25:56,855 --> 00:25:59,119
Two teams have made it to the finals

155
00:25:59,658 --> 00:26:03,788
The girls' team from Bangalore.
And the boys from our college

156
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:11,969
The theme is something your
generation doesn't believe in

157
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,632
Marriage

158
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:12,854
I'll marry you

159
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,559
I'll be yours forever

160
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:21,300
Whatever you want...

161
00:27:21,706 --> 00:27:25,233
I'll always do, I swear

162
00:27:26,611 --> 00:27:28,977
Oh how I wish...

163
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:32,273
"you'd make love to me
all your life..."

164
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:34,211
endless love

165
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,648
I'll marry you

166
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,850
I'll be yours forever

167
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,257
Whatever you want...

168
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,867
I'll always do, I swear

169
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,897
Oh how I wish...

170
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,331
"you'd make love to me
all your life..."

171
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,676
endless love

172
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:57,967
"My first romance,
my first love..."

173
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:01,965
"without you, my love
life's miserable"

174
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:06,237
In the pursuit of desires...

175
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:10,772
"I too have learnt
how to wake sleepless nights"

176
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:17,977
My love, my darling...

177
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:26,258
I'll marry you

178
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,226
I'll be yours forever

179
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:08,831
Any girl will die for me

180
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:13,104
Every girl pines for me

181
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:19,450
"Day and night, I chant your name
I pine..."

182
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,785
I'm dying to take you in my arms

183
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,453
Then tell me, why this distance?

184
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:37,061
I'll marry you

185
00:30:37,969 --> 00:30:41,405
I'll be yours forever

186
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,921
Oh how I wish...

187
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,128
"you'd make love to me
all your life..."

188
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,591
endless love

189
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,528
Puja from Bangalore... where is she?
In the other bus, maybe

190
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,593
Sorry, I missed my bus

191
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,502
You're going to be on that bus
before it reaches Bangalore

192
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,512
Somehow I don't know
what held me back

193
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,359
You've taken a liking to me

194
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,185
I know, from that line in your song

195
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:49,030
Any girl will die for me

196
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,704
At least 15 romances spring up
at every college fest

197
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,572
Yes, and by the end of every fest,
every romance has dried up

198
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:03,046
Not necessarily

199
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:29,239
What wish did you make?
- Can't tell you that

200
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,242
Okay...

201
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:38,848
I just wished some love stories
wouldn't end with these fests

202
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:55,899
Hey stop

203
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:59,302
Didn't I tell you? You'd get the bus
before it gets to Bangalore

204
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,252
Goodness! The prayers

205
00:34:38,376 --> 00:34:39,968
Lovely place

206
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,108
Just imagine... right here...

207
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,839
a skyscraper with a flat
on every floor

208
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:50,320
Sea-facing balconies on
every storey...

209
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:55,316
making every passer-by wish
he was here

210
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:00,927
But would you take away someone
else's dream...

211
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:03,366
to make your dream come true?

212
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:07,364
Whose dream am I taking away?
- My late father's

213
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,171
Ms Tanya, in 20 years
since my father died...

214
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:16,639
not for 20 seconds
have we felt his absence

215
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:23,911
Our home is our temple. No one
in this family ever forgets that

216
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:30,554
So no one gave you
a chance to forget?

217
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,328
How about me giving you one chance?

218
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:42,967
I've only written in the figure "1".
Fill in as many zeros as you fancy

219
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:46,170
Then you'll see
how easy forgetting is

220
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,320
Are you joking?
Or are you illiterate?

221
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:09,432
I'm lettered, but not for sale

222
00:36:10,601 --> 00:36:13,434
Is it the wrong time on a wrong day?

223
00:36:14,605 --> 00:36:17,438
No, you're welcome anytime.
My decision won't change

224
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:29,642
Nice knowing a man who can't be
bought whatever the price

225
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:33,389
But if you want to sell...

226
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:41,397
Are you responding to our ad?
Not quite what you assume

227
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,968
I'll see her out

228
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,336
Om, how did you find her?
Forget it, Ma

229
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,710
Your exams are around the corner
and you're keeping up at nights

230
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,047
What are you upto? Studies?
Or are you at the computer?

231
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:11,125
I make my grade, don't I?
In studies, in sports, entertainment

232
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,499
You ask my principal
what I mean to the college

233
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,104
I need a loan to buy a software.
Loan...?

234
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,167
Yes. Loan. I'll pay it back

235
00:37:25,509 --> 00:37:28,103
You will...?
First, prove something to me

236
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:31,037
Prove...?
What did Jai prove to you?

237
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:38,444
You're spending millions on him.
- Cunning! He's using Jai

238
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,654
Jai knows where he's headed.
He's focussed, he's ambitious

239
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,452
What do you want to do
with your life?

240
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,499
What I want to do?

241
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:53,165
I want to beat you

242
00:37:55,673 --> 00:38:01,509
For me, that will be a happy day.
- Don't get sentimental

243
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,981
Who can beat you? My loan, please.
Get lost

244
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,180
You won't marry me without a dowry?
Goodness! Help me... someone help

245
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:14,113
What's going on?
- Let's take a look

246
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,153
She's the one who fooled Om

247
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,061
Watch, I'll give her a taste of fun!

248
00:38:21,432 --> 00:38:25,869
Right at the wedding altar!
How dare you ask for dowry?

249
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:33,510
What happened, lady?
I had To run away from my wedding

250
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:36,379
My fiance's father is greedy!

251
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:39,515
At the eleventh hour, he demanded
a million from my father!

252
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,680
No, only 800,000

253
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,248
800,000...?
- Okay, 400,000 will do

254
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:47,321
And the sad part is, he kept mum

255
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,527
Don't cry, come with me.
Oh no... no...

256
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,922
Come with me.
- Let go of my wife's arm!

257
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:59,366
Let go of her. This is a shoot.
Let her sit on the pillion

258
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:03,869
I'll miss out on my tv programme.
Don't you watch Mtv? Drop me, please

259
00:39:11,649 --> 00:39:13,583
Where have you brought me?

260
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,592
Why here... in a haunted house?
Haunted house! Come in

261
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:26,587
I told you, it's a tv programme.
It's all a sham! I'm faking

262
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:30,391
I'm for real, my mother's for real
and my brother is for real

263
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:37,232
Om went and got married?
Wrong

264
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:45,148
I warned Cyrus...
Who Cyrus... what Cyrus?

265
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,216
What happened, Ma...?

266
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:55,925
He knows me!

267
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,654
My brother's bride.
Bride...?

268
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,162
Do you like her?
- Bride!

269
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,402
But why have you eloped?

270
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:10,138
Did your parents object?
Only Om objected

271
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:16,575
Who are these guys?
- You're watching MTV Scapegoat

272
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,376
You are the scapegoat

273
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,651
I want you to meet Agesha
my sister-in-law to-be

274
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:26,316
Scapegoat

275
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:31,358
Scapegoat

276
00:40:37,067 --> 00:40:39,661
Om! My sister-in-law is here

277
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,371
Whose sister-in-law?
Agesha, your bride

278
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,038
Be seated

279
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:51,114
Your only daughter?
Yes

280
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:13,362
Lovely...
What...?

281
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:15,431
Tree

282
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:22,205
That tree is about
a hundred years old

283
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,378
And this is a lovely house

284
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,713
And this house is also
about a hundred years old

285
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,255
Even my brother
is hundred years old

286
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:45,324
Can I ask you something?
Straight from the heart...

287
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:57,447
Love's no tv show for fun

288
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:05,311
Love is life. Love is an emotion...

289
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:13,596
that touches hearts, enthralls
for a lifetime, forever

290
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:23,331
Sorry, did I say something wrong?
How do you manage that candour?

291
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:30,439
I remember the sincerity with which
you showed me your childhood photo

292
00:42:30,848 --> 00:42:33,442
That sincerity I liked.
I see that candour in you again

293
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,192
Can I ask you one more thing?

294
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,995
What will it be for you?

295
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,630
An arranged marriage or
love marriage?

296
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,102
Love marriage

297
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,254
One day, I met her...

298
00:43:47,925 --> 00:43:52,453
and she enthralled me

299
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:57,897
When she held my gaze...

300
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,303
I was spellbound...

301
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,303
but she said it all...

302
00:44:03,774 --> 00:44:08,302
I even tried to get away...

303
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:13,306
"but when I looked back,
there she was, right in front of me"

304
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:18,853
"Then I smiled and she smiled back;
when I took a step, she came along"

305
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,851
"Then we became breathless,
and a moment stood stilled"

306
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:33,860
And then, we were in love

307
00:44:34,772 --> 00:44:39,573
That's our love-story

308
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:49,917
That's our life-story

309
00:45:37,134 --> 00:45:42,970
3 months, 28 days and 8 hours ago
we fell in love

310
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,979
You're crazy

311
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:57,987
Why do you drag him everywhere?
He won't leave us alone

312
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:02,492
What does that mean?
- You're bananas

313
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:14,002
I'll be home by eight. Yes, I'm
with Jai. Brian is also with us

314
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:21,135
Why talk to your mother like that?
Like how?

315
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:24,539
So irritably...?
Because she irritates me

316
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:30,382
At times, I hate her.
Maybe Because of the familiarity?

317
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,994
When you're far from home,
you realise...

318
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,790
what mother means,
what a family means

319
00:46:52,176 --> 00:46:55,043
This monkey is hovering around
all the time...

320
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,246
particularly when I'm with you

321
00:46:59,283 --> 00:47:01,217
Yes, because of you

322
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,723
You're seeing my parents today

323
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,727
After we drop Brian.
Won't take long

324
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:18,828
Now smile and give an okay

325
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:26,273
Watch! The poor thing will fall off

326
00:48:19,930 --> 00:48:22,057
Just flatter Mummy...
it'll do just fine

327
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:27,227
Go on, I'll be right back.
Come soon

328
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,103
Giri should be here soon.
Let me show you around

329
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,449
We built this house a decade ago,
outside the city

330
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:54,287
We're just 20 minutes away from town

331
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,128
And Giri loves the hustle-bustle

332
00:49:04,007 --> 00:49:05,941
Say, what's your favourite dish?

333
00:49:09,246 --> 00:49:10,770
Indian

334
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:17,176
You turn out to be exactly like Giri

335
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,984
Who's Giri?

336
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:26,694
Giri Saxena. Nitu's Papa.
Jai Batra

337
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,566
That's your Mummy?

338
00:49:32,369 --> 00:49:34,701
I took her for your sister

339
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:39,832
You know Giri hasn't changed
in these 25 years

340
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:56,258
In my stupidity, I took
your simplicity for sex appeal

341
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,432
Wonderful names.
Om, Jai and Jagadish

342
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:08,100
Why Om-Jai-Jagadish?
Daddy wanted names that...

343
00:50:08,372 --> 00:50:13,036
could be said all in one breath.
Therefore... Om, Jai and Jagadish

344
00:50:13,477 --> 00:50:17,573
Jai wants to build the fastest car
in the world

345
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:23,748
And where would you drive your
fastest car? On Indian roads?

346
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,253
Let's think about that
once the car has been designed

347
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:33,262
Is this flat of yours on Juhu
sea-facing?

348
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:36,255
Not flat. Villa.
Yes, it's sea-facing

349
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,801
How big is it?

350
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:46,835
Nothing too large. Some are hard put
to make out what's larger...?

351
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,306
Our home, or our hearts?

352
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:52,969
One day, I found her

353
00:51:53,977 --> 00:51:58,380
"She looked at me
and she blossomed like a flower"

354
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:03,819
"In my wondrous seasons,
it was an exotic thing to happen..."

355
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:08,655
"a mild drizzle
under a mellow sun"

356
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:16,763
"Then I hid under a church awning
and she stood under a tree..."

357
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,236
when lightning struck...

358
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:29,371
"she ran to me,
in fear of thunder"

359
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:39,650
And then, we were in love

360
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:45,190
That's our love-story

361
00:52:45,795 --> 00:52:50,061
That's our life-story

362
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,945
Landed the job!
My project is through

363
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,753
I'm elated

364
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:21,122
You'll see Jai here. Look into
the camera when you speak

365
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:40,778
Hi Om

366
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:44,443
Jai... how are you?

367
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:52,121
I'm fine, how are you?
- Okay, I'm okay

368
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:59,126
What about your results?
- They're out

369
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,173
Hi sister-in-law

370
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:13,516
How have you been?
Fine. Tell us About your results

371
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,512
Results? As expected

372
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:23,119
I topped the college

373
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:29,464
Is this how you deliver great news?
Yes! Why are you underplaying?

374
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:39,504
I'm so happy, I could hug you!
Get back to India right away

375
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,515
One more good news.
Tell me

376
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:53,183
An automobile giant has offered me
a job. It's about my project

377
00:54:56,693 --> 00:55:01,255
I don't want to lose out
on this opportunity

378
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,905
So returning home will be
a bit difficult

379
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,673
You have bagged such a good offer
and that's just as well

380
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,846
People with education go out
to serve that country

381
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:30,025
I'd rather that you returned
to serve your country

382
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:35,129
Daddy used to say, lose your land,
and you have lost everything

383
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:41,703
We ought to be together, Jai.
Right now, I need you, Jai

384
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:47,838
E-mail from Jai?

385
00:55:53,049 --> 00:55:59,249
Jai has topped his college.
Congratulations, son. Bless you

386
00:56:00,256 --> 00:56:04,590
Enough of it, now come home.
For five years...

387
00:56:04,894 --> 00:56:11,595
I have only seen you growing up
in pictures. Now I want to see you

388
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,975
Om, why did it black out?

389
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,111
Broken connection, happens sometimes

390
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:36,055
Ma told me,
at the end of the story...

391
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:37,291
everything works out fine

392
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:44,257
If not, the story isn't over yet

393
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,051
I'm home, Ma

394
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:04,371
Bless you, son

395
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:00,168
Mummy, why is everybody screaming?

396
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:05,774
"Through the coming and going
of times, of seasons..."

397
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:13,942
"may love never fade
from hearts"

398
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,550
"Unto each other
yive strength..."

399
00:59:25,862 --> 00:59:28,330
"if need be
die for each other"

400
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,793
"In joy and sorrow
let us come together..."

401
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:33,830
may we never part

402
00:59:34,904 --> 00:59:38,169
"Unto each other
grant succour"

403
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,652
This hallowed home of ours...

404
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:26,453
we hold sacred

405
01:00:26,823 --> 01:00:31,851
Here we dreamt our dreams

406
01:01:16,372 --> 01:01:19,569
3 large white rums.
With Pepsi

407
01:01:21,711 --> 01:01:25,704
With Om...?
Shut up. I got To talk To him...

408
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:29,281
about Nitu. Besides, we brothers
are meeting up after years

409
01:01:52,208 --> 01:01:57,510
It's a new drink. I ordered it.
Yes, give it a try

410
01:01:57,947 --> 01:02:00,973
But I don't take cold drinks.
Yive it a try, for our sakes

411
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:13,995
Cheering a cold drink?

412
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,567
What drink is this?

413
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,830
This drink will become popular

414
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:12,550
Isn't she beautiful?

415
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,059
Very beautiful

416
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:23,496
Jagadish, just look.
She's exquisite

417
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:27,030
What are you staring at, Jags?
So beautiful

418
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:31,039
She and Agesha would
yo along well. I'll talk to Ma

419
01:03:37,113 --> 01:03:38,637
To Nitu

420
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:55,061
I would like to introduce you
to my little brothers

421
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,459
This is Jai

422
01:03:58,167 --> 01:03:59,896
That's Jagadish

423
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:07,772
I tried to evade them,
but they forced me to drink some rum

424
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,119
Friends, in our times...

425
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:21,051
where will you find brothers
who love so dearly?

426
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:27,059
My brothers are like my limbs

427
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:36,570
Get out

428
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:39,898
Time to buy a bigger car.
This is the one that stays

429
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:44,442
Jagadish...
- Take care of that kid. He's high

430
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:49,777
Playing big brother.
Jagadish, you knock

431
01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:08,930
What's up?

432
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:17,178
Tonight, we're happy!
Reason being...

433
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,706
Jai has found a daughter-in-law
for you

434
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,116
I even okayed her

435
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:31,590
But who is she?

436
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:35,925
She's a foreigner. But she's Indian

437
01:05:36,232 --> 01:05:38,166
Say yes, Ma.
- Ma's over there

438
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:40,501
Say yes, Ma

439
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,166
Say yes

440
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:52,574
Say yes, Ma...
one minute! Happy days! Here again

441
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,957
Ornate bangles on her arms

442
01:07:14,997 --> 01:07:19,229
Wedding music on the shehnai

443
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,243
Ornate bangles...

444
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:39,577
and the wedding shehnai...

445
01:07:40,089 --> 01:07:43,252
and henna-dyed feet...

446
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:49,058
it'll be a happy wedding

447
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:55,101
Happy days are here again

448
01:09:00,936 --> 01:09:04,963
"Somewhere between
refusing and relenting..."

449
01:09:05,574 --> 01:09:09,977
I fell for this marriage

450
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:15,379
"Sweetheart, she was yours
until yesterday..."

451
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:19,981
"now she's a sister-in-law
to me"

452
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:26,153
"There's someone, somewhere for you.
Marriages are made in heaven"

453
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:31,124
"Somewhere, sometime,
loving hearts come close"

454
01:09:31,567 --> 01:09:36,436
"The goddess of fortunes has come
to make a heaven out of my home"

455
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:41,434
"To weave glittering, golden dreams
of joys into my life"

456
01:10:26,755 --> 01:10:31,249
My mother is blessing you

457
01:10:31,594 --> 01:10:35,860
May we never part

458
01:10:36,865 --> 01:10:41,461
"God spare our home
the evil eye"

459
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:46,237
"May never God's face be turned
away from us"

460
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,669
I swear...

461
01:10:49,945 --> 01:10:52,243
by my mother's love for me...

462
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:54,908
we'll love each other so much...

463
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,517
"everyone in the world
will be jealous of us"

464
01:10:57,987 --> 01:11:02,515
"Whatever anyone says,
your writ runs in the family"

465
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:07,529
"We'll stay together forever,
you and I have promised each other"

466
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:17,569
Happy days are here again

467
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:51,432
Jai, say hi to the guests

468
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:56,574
Excuse me Mrs Saxena,
may I have a word with you?

469
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:04,218
Ma was saying that you hired
this huge Mercedes?

470
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:09,248
We have some guests who have flown
in from America, some from Delhi

471
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:14,320
Nitu can't possibly take this car...
it's going to be very embarrassing

472
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:20,192
I would've conceded but...

473
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:26,973
that car is part of many memories,
of my Daddy, Ma

474
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:32,580
And it's our lucky car.
I took Agesha home in that car

475
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,918
But this one little thing
will break Nitu's heart

476
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,386
Nitu is mature, she'll understand.
Try and understand, Om

477
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:46,594
Jagadish, tell Ma to go home
and prepare for the reception

478
01:12:49,098 --> 01:12:51,589
Take Nitu home in our car.
That car...?

479
01:12:58,907 --> 01:13:00,841
Brother! Your turn now

480
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,646
Your brother-in-law-cum-chauffeur
at your service, dear sister-in-law

481
01:13:15,758 --> 01:13:18,056
Drive carefully.
- I'll try

482
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,589
Move it! Batra family on the move

483
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:37,645
Stalling...

484
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:41,649
Let's take a look

485
01:13:48,257 --> 01:13:50,191
Jagadish, take a look

486
01:13:53,328 --> 01:13:55,262
Can't make out a thing

487
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:58,198
Here's hoping it isn't clogged dirt.
Come on...

488
01:13:58,767 --> 01:14:02,100
put to the real test your five years
of American education. Get going

489
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:10,438
Nitu, stay inside.
It won't look too nice

490
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:18,112
What about fixing a junk car on your
wedding day? Does that look nice?

491
01:14:19,888 --> 01:14:22,652
My Ma had another car waiting
didn't she?

492
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:26,990
Oh come on, it's okay.
- No it isn't okay Jai

493
01:14:34,770 --> 01:14:37,034
Sister-in-law, Jai is jacked

494
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:49,312
Never expected you to be up so early

495
01:14:49,785 --> 01:14:52,083
But I am an early-riser

496
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:55,722
Early to bed, then early to rise

497
01:14:56,225 --> 01:15:00,719
And the dark circles under his eyes
tell us he hasn't slept all night

498
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:08,403
Which firm have you decided to join?
All three offers are equally good

499
01:15:09,204 --> 01:15:12,139
But I'm thinking in terms of...
Choose the job that gives you...

500
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,308
the best scope of advancement.
- I'm waiting for the day...

501
01:15:16,578 --> 01:15:18,910
when you'll build the fastest car
in the world

502
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:22,116
Jai, just do it

503
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,979
What's all this?
Nothing much

504
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:34,726
Just my stuff, my stock
of mineral water, juices

505
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:39,232
My exercise kit, etc.
Mamma sent it

506
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:43,364
Did you have to get it
from your Mummy?

507
01:15:43,639 --> 01:15:46,267
We would've bought it for you

508
01:15:47,509 --> 01:15:52,173
I guess, that's a mother's love.
Like when Jai was in America...

509
01:15:52,581 --> 01:15:55,175
his mother would send over...
what do you call those...

510
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:58,313
those sweet gramflour-balls
and the mango pickle

511
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,518
So my Ma sent me this stuff

512
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,166
Careful. Juice cartons on the right

513
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:29,444
Changing lifestyles

514
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:42,193
Sorry, I had to change my dress

515
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:45,633
Rice, please.
Mummy sends you her regards

516
01:16:53,609 --> 01:16:58,103
The food also looks too spicy.
It's no good for your health

517
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:01,849
Sister-in-law...

518
01:17:02,317 --> 01:17:05,115
I hear your Dad runs
a roadside Indian eatery in America

519
01:17:06,922 --> 01:17:09,857
Not roadside eatery, a restaurant.
And it's his business

520
01:17:13,028 --> 01:17:17,556
You wouldn't know, because you've
never stepped outside this town

521
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,233
Isn't that so, Jagadish?
Will you please pass the salad?

522
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,537
Nitu, I made pasta for you

523
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:37,844
Drink it up, nothing will go wrong.
That's the water we drink

524
01:17:40,622 --> 01:17:43,853
I think she can't digest our waters,
reminds her of American waters

525
01:17:47,596 --> 01:17:52,898
One gets accustomed to habits and
habits can only be changed slowly

526
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,899
Only bad habits

527
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:04,573
Good habits need not be changed, Om

528
01:18:05,981 --> 01:18:09,417
What is habit?
Habit has two meanings...

529
01:18:09,985 --> 01:18:12,317
one in India, one in America

530
01:18:13,388 --> 01:18:16,516
In America, when youngsters butt
into discussions between elders...

531
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:21,457
it's called freedom.
Freedom is Nothing bad

532
01:18:22,097 --> 01:18:26,033
But freedom is different
from decency

533
01:18:26,568 --> 01:18:29,230
What was that...?
Not indecency

534
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:33,903
Decency. Which means, manners.
Manners...?

535
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:42,916
I don't need to learn manners
from you

536
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,085
At least, not here in India

537
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:49,023
No matter. Manners apart...

538
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:52,522
there's much you may pick up.
Just make a beginning

539
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:56,430
Jagadish, enough! Can we eat now?
Sure, when did I forbid you...?

540
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:13,378
Come off it Jagadish

541
01:19:19,654 --> 01:19:21,986
Changing circumstances

542
01:19:37,839 --> 01:19:44,039
I can't take family politics.
I speak my heart and you know it

543
01:19:45,113 --> 01:19:49,311
I can't pull off
this typical Indian-bride-act

544
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:57,558
But I'll still tell you like
a typical Indian husband, I love you

545
01:20:03,298 --> 01:20:07,860
My family members love me dearly.
But naturally, they love you too

546
01:20:14,176 --> 01:20:16,508
Let's all go for a Sunday picnic

547
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:04,116
When does love happen?

548
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:18,703
"Love happens,
when it has to happen"

549
01:21:22,978 --> 01:21:26,505
What means love?

550
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,565
Love is...

551
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:50,164
God

552
01:22:37,986 --> 01:22:41,183
Just feel love

553
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,521
"It's more exotic
than the most exotic"

554
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:52,559
"Like a fragrance,
love suffuses your breath"

555
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,236
"Love is what
the restless heart needs"

556
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:29,736
"Love's rhythm is mysterious;
love-pangs are strange"

557
01:23:33,641 --> 01:23:38,578
Them what is love?

558
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:44,444
Love is...

559
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:47,051
God

560
01:24:15,383 --> 01:24:20,411
"On listless days,
restless nights..."

561
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:25,824
love's passion is intoxicating

562
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:29,922
And it's the truth...

563
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:37,271
"believe it or not, at least
for once, it's everyone's folly"

564
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:07,925
"The thirst for love,
you will know..."

565
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:13,767
when love is on your lips

566
01:25:14,342 --> 01:25:19,302
So what is love?

567
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:24,783
Love is...

568
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,648
God

569
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:14,392
We are about to present our
weekly programme, "Monkey Capers"

570
01:26:15,970 --> 01:26:19,030
You got to identify the one
I'm mimicking. The right answer...

571
01:26:19,541 --> 01:26:24,376
gets a chance to dine with me
at a world famous roadside inn

572
01:26:26,381 --> 01:26:28,178
First character...

573
01:26:29,717 --> 01:26:32,379
"Ma I told you not to ask for money
when I'm going to work"

574
01:26:32,787 --> 01:26:33,981
Om

575
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:45,194
Number Two: "What...? Over...? But
I gave you pocket money yesterday"

576
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:49,561
Number Three...

577
01:26:50,505 --> 01:26:53,997
"How old is this house?
How old is that tree?"

578
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:57,605
No... not like that!
Agesha

579
01:26:57,979 --> 01:27:03,110
Number Four: "I want to make
the world's fastest car"

580
01:27:03,851 --> 01:27:05,113
Jai

581
01:27:20,635 --> 01:27:23,195
"Don't even talk about the
food here!"

582
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:28,002
"The urchins are terrible!
They stare"

583
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:32,912
"The food is so oily, so spicy!

584
01:27:33,514 --> 01:27:35,948
Nothing like mineral water"
in America"

585
01:27:43,524 --> 01:27:46,186
Personal conversations
with my Mamma?

586
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:50,190
Ridiculing me in public!
How degrading

587
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,733
Jagadish, that was in bad taste

588
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:56,764
Shut up! That was bad

589
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:10,083
He's walking out

590
01:28:28,569 --> 01:28:36,499
We sing to the glory of our Lord

591
01:28:37,578 --> 01:28:45,508
"Unto to Redeemer of His flock,
we pray"

592
01:28:54,295 --> 01:28:57,560
Om, has Jai taken up a job?
Not yet

593
01:28:59,634 --> 01:29:04,071
I'm asking because I lent you
12.5 million for his education

594
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,163
Amounting now, to 17.5 million
including interests

595
01:29:07,675 --> 01:29:09,939
And I'm charging you only bank rates

596
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:11,440
I know Shekhar

597
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:14,773
As soon as Jai takes up a job,
I'll pay you back, first of all

598
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:20,777
Relax, you're a friend,
not a stranger. No tensions

599
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,959
The chairman of Maruti and I
are good friends. If you say so...

600
01:29:26,127 --> 01:29:28,425
I can talk to him
about a job forJai

601
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:30,889
Jai has several job offers

602
01:29:31,165 --> 01:29:34,100
All he has to do, is select.
I'll talk to him right away

603
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:48,143
You aren't doing this for yourself.
You're brilliant. And we're duds

604
01:29:48,750 --> 01:29:51,685
You can use computers to dig out
the exam papers for us

605
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:54,680
As morals say,
one ought to help pals

606
01:29:55,757 --> 01:29:58,453
All right. See me at home tonight

607
01:30:00,762 --> 01:30:03,697
Inside the university's mainframe!
What frame...?

608
01:30:04,098 --> 01:30:08,694
We're inside the university bank.
We just got to break into the papers

609
01:30:09,504 --> 01:30:12,496
Just got to figure out the password.
Of course you will

610
01:30:12,974 --> 01:30:14,737
Let's concentrate

611
01:30:21,749 --> 01:30:23,683
Go on, smoke. It's okay

612
01:30:27,889 --> 01:30:30,687
Give me some passwords you know.
I'll give it a try

613
01:30:31,459 --> 01:30:33,393
Shakespeare?
Madhya Pradesh...?

614
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:41,695
Have you met the managing director?
Yes, but he wants me To sign up...

615
01:30:41,969 --> 01:30:45,370
on an 8-year bond.
Then sign up

616
01:30:46,908 --> 01:30:50,537
You're staying here, aren't you?
Why eight? Sign up for 10 years

617
01:30:51,813 --> 01:30:54,748
It'll be over in no time, just like
your five years in college

618
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:06,359
Thanks to your foolishness,
we've lost two chances

619
01:31:06,694 --> 01:31:08,855
Last chance! Please give
sensible suggestions

620
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:35,954
Remember! I'm doing all this only
for you. No one must know, okay?

621
01:31:37,892 --> 01:31:45,298
Shekhar needs cash. Immediately.
- I'll sign up tomorrow

622
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:01,815
What do you mean, you'll sign up?
Aren't we going back?

623
01:32:02,283 --> 01:32:04,274
But Om borrowed the money
for my education

624
01:32:04,685 --> 01:32:09,281
Out there you can earn lots more.
Just mail the money home

625
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:15,023
No American company will give me a
loan. And Om wants cash, immediately

626
01:32:15,663 --> 01:32:19,497
This urgency was never the point.
The decision to borrow was his own

627
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,902
You knew nothing about it

628
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:29,474
And you're forgetting something.
Only a few weeks to go...

629
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:33,813
before your work permit expires.
And you got to return before that

630
01:32:35,883 --> 01:32:41,515
Is everything all right? What was
that about the work permit?

631
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:52,292
It's nothing, Ma. You haven't gone
to bed yet? Go to sleep

632
01:32:58,739 --> 01:33:03,870
He must return to America
before his work permit expires

633
01:33:12,787 --> 01:33:15,051
Jai, will you step outside
for a minute?

634
01:33:18,693 --> 01:33:20,820
Whatever you got to say,
say it in front of Nitu

635
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:28,897
Have you informed Om about this?
About what?

636
01:33:29,403 --> 01:33:35,035
About your returning to America.
- I haven't told him

637
01:33:35,843 --> 01:33:38,311
You ought to.
But he insists...

638
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:41,544
on returning the money right away
and that's impossible

639
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:44,543
Then make it possible.
To keep This family together...

640
01:33:44,952 --> 01:33:49,252
throw yourself into the fires.
Om threw himself in the fires too

641
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:52,353
But I never heard him complain.
When did I talk About Om?

642
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:56,696
Ma says, in this country those who
put up with suffering are deified

643
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,899
Not Gods, we want to
live human lives

644
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,531
At least, be a brother to him

645
01:34:04,739 --> 01:34:09,540
He gave you strength, made a man out
of you. Do your duty as a brother

646
01:34:10,011 --> 01:34:17,349
I will do my duty, but I'll do it
my way. Not the way Om wants

647
01:34:21,956 --> 01:34:24,288
I must go back to America

648
01:34:47,815 --> 01:34:56,416
One man. He bore everyone's burden,
wouldn't let anyone bear the brunt

649
01:34:57,591 --> 01:35:05,521
Come the time when we ought to share
his burdens, it's each to his own?

650
01:35:13,641 --> 01:35:18,010
No Ma! You don't understand!
- True son

651
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:22,609
When you were an infant,
before you learnt how to speak...

652
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:30,116
I knew your every need.
Now you're grown up...

653
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:36,622
now you can speak out for yourself;
but I understand not a word you say

654
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:02,813
The justification of your demand is
not in question. Money, we haven't

655
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:05,724
Just 200,000.
Only to pay for my studies

656
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:14,029
The buck stops just in time
when it's my turn

657
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:18,069
The money was there forJai
before he could ask

658
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,241
Jagadish, I never discriminated
between you and Jai

659
01:36:22,076 --> 01:36:25,011
I still haven't been able to repay
what I borrowed forJai's education

660
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:30,406
Wouldn't make a difference to borrow
another 200,000 for my education

661
01:36:30,818 --> 01:36:33,787
It will make a difference!
But I'm not refusing you

662
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:36,679
I'm only asking for time.
In a day or two...

663
01:36:37,091 --> 01:36:40,686
once Jai has signed his service
bond, all our problems are solved

664
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:42,060
No

665
01:36:44,532 --> 01:36:47,433
I've worked out another way
to solve all our problems

666
01:36:49,136 --> 01:36:51,070
Sell this house

667
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:03,442
Sell the house and all our problems
are automatically taken care of

668
01:37:03,851 --> 01:37:08,754
Yours, Om's and mine.
- I didn't send you to America...

669
01:37:09,156 --> 01:37:13,092
to lose your values.
Talk of selling the house?

670
01:37:14,161 --> 01:37:15,890
Ma has spent a lifetime here

671
01:37:16,163 --> 01:37:18,097
The souls of my father,
my grandfather rest here

672
01:37:18,799 --> 01:37:22,735
I respect your feelings. But that's
your way of thinking, not mine

673
01:37:23,137 --> 01:37:26,538
Why is America on the ascent? People
over there don't think like you

674
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:34,074
What's this America-America about?
A short stay changes your attitude?

675
01:37:35,149 --> 01:37:37,083
With time, everything must change

676
01:37:37,484 --> 01:37:39,884
Dispositions, demeanours
and dwellings

677
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:43,882
What are you saying, Jai? Quiet!
Why? Before This place was built...

678
01:37:44,291 --> 01:37:48,091
our ancestors must've lived
elsewhere. Given our disposition...

679
01:37:48,495 --> 01:37:51,896
would our house ever been built?
- Please, don't fight

680
01:37:52,299 --> 01:37:54,767
I don't want 200,000.
I'll take the course later

681
01:37:55,202 --> 01:38:00,333
No Jagadish, the mistake was mine!
For him, this is a house. Not home

682
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:06,138
I sent him away to boarding school
to give him a good education

683
01:38:06,547 --> 01:38:10,244
I sent him to America, to make a man
out of him. He never stayed at home

684
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:12,482
He can't comprehend
what a home means

685
01:38:12,786 --> 01:38:14,720
You're being sentimental
for no reason

686
01:38:15,122 --> 01:38:19,456
But maybe you are against progress.
After you've given me an education...

687
01:38:19,860 --> 01:38:24,297
you want me to sign an 8-year bond!
Aren't you impeding my growth?

688
01:38:25,165 --> 01:38:27,463
For 200,000 aren't you impeding
Jagadish's career?

689
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:33,306
How does it matter if we sell this?
In your place, I would've sold it

690
01:38:35,209 --> 01:38:40,146
This house was Daddy's dream. Om has
made sacrifices to preserve it

691
01:38:42,016 --> 01:38:45,315
Jagadish, am I impeding
your progress?

692
01:38:46,887 --> 01:38:48,821
Am I against Jai making progress?

693
01:38:50,357 --> 01:38:55,659
This is the India, where son fulfills
his father's dream! He forgets

694
01:38:57,231 --> 01:39:00,962
When he lights his father's pyre
the son takes the vow of...

695
01:39:01,402 --> 01:39:05,202
fulfilling his father's obligations
and that is what I'm trying to do

696
01:39:28,095 --> 01:39:32,532
I know, you do not concur with me.
But can I tell you something?

697
01:39:35,336 --> 01:39:38,567
I do not concur
with your philosophy

698
01:39:42,343 --> 01:39:44,607
I have great respect for you,
my brother

699
01:40:11,638 --> 01:40:15,005
I hate carelessness.
No, if you can't handle it...

700
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:20,676
why didn't you tell me? No I can't
discuss this now. I'll call later

701
01:40:25,052 --> 01:40:26,952
What would you like? Tea, coffee...?

702
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:31,515
Ms Tanya, you wanted to buy my house.
Of course, I remember

703
01:40:36,063 --> 01:40:38,293
I have still preserved
this cheque

704
01:40:41,368 --> 01:40:45,998
How many more zeros will you add?
Sorry

705
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:58,352
I must sell my house,
else my family will break up

706
01:41:02,222 --> 01:41:05,350
Are you still interested
in buying my house?

707
01:41:06,627 --> 01:41:11,030
Had you not sold it already
I'd love to buy it out

708
01:41:14,234 --> 01:41:17,169
Had I not sold it...?
I don't understand

709
01:41:19,306 --> 01:41:22,002
Mr Batra, your house is no longer
your property

710
01:41:22,409 --> 01:41:24,673
You've sold it already

711
01:41:25,279 --> 01:41:28,476
To whom...?
To my fiance

712
01:41:29,483 --> 01:41:32,475
If you're interested,
you can see the papers

713
01:41:33,487 --> 01:41:36,684
Take a look...
your signatures, aren't they?

714
01:41:43,464 --> 01:41:48,026
Yes... these are receipts I wrote out
when I borrowed money from Shekhar

715
01:41:48,469 --> 01:41:53,202
Yes. But you mortgaged your house
when you took the loan, didn't you?

716
01:41:58,479 --> 01:42:00,606
How did these papers reach you?

717
01:42:03,484 --> 01:42:07,648
Shekhar is my fiance.
And your house is my wedding gift

718
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:12,217
Don't tell me you want
to make a singer out of Tanya

719
01:42:12,626 --> 01:42:16,221
She can't sing. All she knows
is how to make money

720
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:26,264
Shekhar, you deceived me...?
What deception...?

721
01:42:26,773 --> 01:42:32,405
I never imagined! For the money
you were grabbing my house

722
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:44,520
As long as I was giving,
I was a god?

723
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:48,120
And now I'm a cheating scoundrel?

724
01:42:51,498 --> 01:42:53,966
As long as you're a do-yooder,
everything's hunky dory...

725
01:42:54,368 --> 01:42:57,804
as long as I deny myself,
as long as I give away millions...

726
01:42:58,238 --> 01:43:02,140
without a word! Am I to apologise
because I'm rich, moneyed?

727
01:43:02,543 --> 01:43:04,602
Mr Om is saying nothing of the sort.
Why are you getting upset?

728
01:43:05,012 --> 01:43:07,606
I'm upset because I considered him
my friend

729
01:43:08,115 --> 01:43:09,878
He's more than a brother to me

730
01:43:10,250 --> 01:43:13,947
And he says I have deceived him?
Well all right, I have deceived you

731
01:43:14,421 --> 01:43:16,355
Why don't you return my money?

732
01:43:16,690 --> 01:43:19,716
Why not prove that love
is stronger than money?

733
01:43:20,928 --> 01:43:23,089
The three of you,
Om, Jai and Jagadish

734
01:43:23,497 --> 01:43:25,431
Come on, get together!
Pay me back

735
01:43:26,600 --> 01:43:32,869
Else, vacate your house in 48 hours.
I'm going to get a court order

736
01:43:34,641 --> 01:43:36,802
And don't come to work
from tomorrow onwards

737
01:43:39,546 --> 01:43:43,209
They will vacate the house.
You told me, they're men of word

738
01:43:52,559 --> 01:43:55,187
Papa, Uncle Jai is leaving

739
01:44:06,707 --> 01:44:10,643
Brother...
Yes Jai...?

740
01:44:13,413 --> 01:44:20,148
I want to talk to you.
You are returning?

741
01:44:24,358 --> 01:44:26,485
Yes, I'm leaving

742
01:44:29,363 --> 01:44:31,490
If I don't leave, there will be
a big problem

743
01:44:36,303 --> 01:44:39,795
Do you have your green card?
I have it

744
01:44:40,474 --> 01:44:46,538
But I might lose my job.
You got my go-ahead

745
01:45:01,395 --> 01:45:06,059
Besides, what can you achieve
living in this country? Go away

746
01:45:07,534 --> 01:45:13,564
At every step lies deceit,
friends will stab you in the back

747
01:45:18,812 --> 01:45:20,746
Oh, my room is downstairs

748
01:45:21,181 --> 01:45:28,553
Leave, as soon as you can.
You have my consent

749
01:45:35,629 --> 01:45:38,826
I'll send money.
- That won't be needed

750
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:41,267
No, I will send money

751
01:46:27,414 --> 01:46:30,178
Anil Khanna. I'm the principal
in the college Jagadish goes to

752
01:46:30,584 --> 01:46:33,417
I know.
We would like To see his room

753
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:42,954
The principal.
He wants to see Jagadish

754
01:46:46,466 --> 01:46:48,297
What is the matter...?
- I don't know

755
01:46:55,876 --> 01:46:57,173
Sir... you...?

756
01:46:59,746 --> 01:47:02,044
We must check your computer

757
01:47:07,521 --> 01:47:11,821
What is your password?
Why sir...?

758
01:47:12,926 --> 01:47:15,019
He wants to know your password

759
01:47:16,797 --> 01:47:18,958
Saraswati.
What...?

760
01:47:19,699 --> 01:47:22,133
Saraswati. Our mother's name

761
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:54,491
Our suspicion is true. The papers
were stolen by Jagadish's computer

762
01:47:57,904 --> 01:47:59,235
Atul...

763
01:48:02,509 --> 01:48:05,740
Did Jagadish use this computer
to give you the question papers?

764
01:48:17,691 --> 01:48:19,556
Why did you have to do this?

765
01:48:20,927 --> 01:48:26,695
Someone tell me what he has done.
- I'll tell you Mrs Batra

766
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:30,495
Jagadish used his computer...

767
01:48:30,937 --> 01:48:35,738
just like a burglar
who enters homes and steals

768
01:48:38,545 --> 01:48:44,074
But this is thievery of
the educated, done for easy money

769
01:48:45,519 --> 01:48:49,319
Mrs Batra, I might report him to
the police. But I haven't the heart

770
01:48:50,690 --> 01:48:54,091
But he will never gain admission into
any university. That's his punishment

771
01:48:55,195 --> 01:48:58,187
He will never find employment
in any computer company

772
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:06,428
His future... I'm very sorry.
But Why did he steal?

773
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:12,106
Whatever the reason might've been
only Jagadish can tell

774
01:49:47,747 --> 01:49:49,681
You have betrayed my faith in you!

775
01:49:50,850 --> 01:49:53,876
Not you, all of us bear
the punishment

776
01:49:54,955 --> 01:49:57,890
How much money did you make
out of selling papers?

777
01:49:59,826 --> 01:50:05,321
Even you think I'd do such a thing?
I was just helping a friend

778
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:09,032
At least you'd understand that,
I learnt it only from you

779
01:50:11,738 --> 01:50:16,198
Learnt from me? What? Thieving?
What am I? A thief?

780
01:50:17,777 --> 01:50:22,305
Helping friends! Is this how
you help friends? By robbing?

781
01:50:23,116 --> 01:50:26,108
You haven't a degree,
you have no future. You're ruined

782
01:50:27,187 --> 01:50:32,318
You are a thief! I am a thief's
brother. And that's the truth

783
01:50:36,963 --> 01:50:39,898
You will achieve nothing in life

784
01:50:41,668 --> 01:50:44,694
Jai was my weakness,
you were my strength

785
01:50:45,138 --> 01:50:49,131
But today, you make me weak.
You have left me crippled

786
01:51:07,027 --> 01:51:08,961
Jagadish, my son...

787
01:51:16,936 --> 01:51:20,667
Mamma, where have Uncle Jai
and Uncle Jagadish gone away?

788
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:24,269
They have gone out for a while,
they're going to be back

789
01:51:24,911 --> 01:51:26,742
Don't lie to the child

790
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:35,617
Om... my son, this house
is rooted on rock-solid foundation

791
01:51:36,923 --> 01:51:39,949
Jai and Jagadish will be back.
Surely

792
01:51:42,028 --> 01:51:47,295
Only if we have this house.
What does that mean?

793
01:51:51,137 --> 01:51:53,765
As of now, this house
belongs to Shekhar Malhotra

794
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:58,007
What...?
- I borrowed forJai's education

795
01:51:58,411 --> 01:52:02,006
Then I couldn't repay.
Now he has claimed this house

796
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:09,020
Joys you have always shared

797
01:52:10,090 --> 01:52:15,027
Will you keep your sorrows
to yourself? Why...?

798
01:52:16,863 --> 01:52:21,960
Because he is Om and he wishes
to become a god among men

799
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:28,137
High time that you thought
about yourself, my son

800
01:52:32,779 --> 01:52:38,115
When must we leave this house?
Tomorrow morning

801
01:52:51,464 --> 01:52:54,695
Rita, they're married. Let them
take their decisions in life

802
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:57,365
Like her decision
about getting married

803
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:02,237
Mamma, I'm happy I married Jai.
- Great! I'm elated

804
01:53:04,944 --> 01:53:06,878
Your mother will never change

805
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:47,236
Work with their research teams?
Give up my claim to my design?

806
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:53,277
Then don't. But what will you do?
Think it over once again Jai

807
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,754
Are you making a mistake?
Grave mistake

808
01:54:58,224 --> 01:55:04,823
Will you go back to India and prove
that Om was right and we were wrong?

809
01:55:05,365 --> 01:55:07,299
I'm not going back to India

810
01:55:15,475 --> 01:55:20,310
I came to this city because this is
a midway place. Not fast like Mumbai

811
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:25,146
Nor slow, like our Satna.
As of now, I'm working in Pizza Hut

812
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:29,711
But someday, I'll build myself
a fast food chain

813
01:55:40,967 --> 01:55:45,563
So I got to find myself a job soon.
Yes, I talked up a computer firm

814
01:55:46,005 --> 01:55:49,941
They order pizzas from us.
When Can I meet up?

815
01:55:50,376 --> 01:55:53,368
Tonight. Actually, they start
working from 10 in the night

816
01:56:02,989 --> 01:56:04,217
G Four

817
01:56:05,291 --> 01:56:07,020
Heard lots about you

818
01:56:07,427 --> 01:56:10,225
Hacking papers from
Mumbai University is no mean task

819
01:56:16,936 --> 01:56:21,771
We're entering a bank account.
The one who pulls off the heist...

820
01:56:22,275 --> 01:56:25,210
is entitled to 50 percent
of the loot

821
01:56:25,945 --> 01:56:28,971
The rest is ours. G Four's

822
01:56:31,684 --> 01:56:35,780
So... you are professional hackers?

823
01:56:37,490 --> 01:56:42,450
What are you? Baby hacker?
One thing for Sure

824
01:56:42,862 --> 01:56:45,023
If we're thieves,
you're a thief too

825
01:56:49,335 --> 01:56:52,532
Grandma, why have we left our home?
Why have we come here?

826
01:56:54,440 --> 01:57:00,037
It was too large a house
for so few of us

827
01:57:00,446 --> 01:57:03,472
Grandma, I don't like it here

828
01:57:04,417 --> 01:57:08,285
If you and Arnav would like to
live with your Daddy for a while...

829
01:57:10,456 --> 01:57:12,390
now that he has school holidays...?

830
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:18,228
Are you trying to send me away?
Like you sent Jai and Jagadish away?

831
01:57:20,366 --> 01:57:25,998
I've no qualms about living with you.
I value your sense of integrity

832
01:57:26,439 --> 01:57:31,376
Om, I can put up with everything
but I can't bear to see you sad

833
01:57:32,345 --> 01:57:34,074
Papa, I'm ready

834
01:57:48,795 --> 01:57:51,559
Papa, where are we going?
To see Uncle Ramprasad

835
01:57:57,603 --> 01:58:00,299
Uncle Ramprasad...
- Ramprasad, it's me

836
01:58:02,408 --> 01:58:04,899
Stay back.
- Why don't you understand?

837
01:58:05,411 --> 01:58:06,844
He knows me

838
01:58:07,213 --> 01:58:12,412
The Minister for Culture has invited
me to sing at his son's wedding

839
01:58:14,420 --> 01:58:17,981
Well, what brings you here?
You know Shekhar and I...

840
01:58:18,357 --> 01:58:21,554
Have split. What next?
- I'm producing an album

841
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:26,958
And I want you to sing.
Who me...? How Can I sing?

842
01:58:27,366 --> 01:58:30,961
You know, I'm on a 5-year contract
with Shekhar. I can't break that

843
01:58:31,404 --> 01:58:36,307
But I gave you your break.
- I got a recording. Can't talk much

844
01:59:08,474 --> 01:59:10,601
Nitu, it's only a matter of a while

845
01:59:12,478 --> 01:59:18,417
Are you bonkers? Something like this?
Or, am I just love-crazed about you

846
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:26,421
No one's crazy. Not you. Not I.
You are my strength, my family

847
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:30,227
Else, how long does it take for a man
to break under these circumstances?

848
01:59:31,497 --> 01:59:35,490
You have reposed trust in me,
I'm grateful. Thank you

849
02:00:42,268 --> 02:00:44,202
I'll deliver that order

850
02:00:51,410 --> 02:00:52,843
I'll deliver this one

851
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:11,222
Pizza delivery.
Over there

852
02:01:30,149 --> 02:01:32,879
Sir, please give me one chance.
I came to Bangalore...

853
02:01:33,286 --> 02:01:36,881
hoping I'd work for this company.
Given a job, I'll prove...

854
02:01:37,290 --> 02:01:39,554
how profitable I can be
for this company

855
02:01:41,627 --> 02:01:44,562
Perseverance and perspective
leads to success...

856
02:01:44,964 --> 02:01:46,898
not impetuousness and impatience

857
02:01:50,836 --> 02:01:54,602
I've read much about you
in the papers. I know your story

858
02:01:55,374 --> 02:01:58,002
I'm a fan of yours.
For me, you are an ideal

859
02:01:59,211 --> 02:02:04,615
I only ask for 100 seconds to prove
my capabilities. Please...

860
02:02:10,389 --> 02:02:19,058
I know I can develop a software
which can be bigger than windows

861
02:02:24,370 --> 02:02:30,605
I want to write a software
that prevents hacking

862
02:02:43,689 --> 02:02:44,815
Stop

863
02:02:56,602 --> 02:02:59,002
Father and son,
together on the street?

864
02:02:59,839 --> 02:03:02,433
Son, have you quit school?
Holidays

865
02:03:03,743 --> 02:03:05,677
Papa is on holiday too?

866
02:03:06,746 --> 02:03:09,340
Om, we might not be
working together

867
02:03:09,749 --> 02:03:11,683
Doesn't mean
our friendship is over?

868
02:03:13,652 --> 02:03:19,113
From the new house, I can't watch
the sea. I haven't friends anymore

869
02:03:21,694 --> 02:03:25,687
You never scolded me before.
Without me...

870
02:03:26,098 --> 02:03:29,761
you got no standing on the market.
Everywhere, you will get a no

871
02:03:30,236 --> 02:03:36,368
And what's this? Do I see anger?
Are you taking it out on the baby?

872
02:03:39,211 --> 02:03:41,008
Change of philosophy?

873
02:03:42,415 --> 02:03:45,680
Love isn't more powerful
than money. Brothers...

874
02:03:48,754 --> 02:03:52,485
one left for America,
one for Bangalore

875
02:03:53,893 --> 02:03:56,259
You called me a loner, didn't you?

876
02:03:57,930 --> 02:04:01,696
And how long have I been telling you
that brothers never stick together

877
02:04:03,502 --> 02:04:07,404
Brothers together. Just verbiage,
not in real life

878
02:04:10,810 --> 02:04:12,971
Yes honey, coming

879
02:04:15,714 --> 02:04:17,739
Tanya and I are going
to see the architect

880
02:04:19,552 --> 02:04:23,682
We're building a five star hotel
in place of your house

881
02:04:37,570 --> 02:04:41,233
Day after day, trying to piece
my life together...

882
02:04:41,807 --> 02:04:47,268
resolving to start life anew... but
what can I do? It all lies in ruins

883
02:04:51,050 --> 02:04:55,077
With my five-year old son,
I wander the streets. Aimlessly

884
02:04:57,089 --> 02:05:02,288
I told you! KK-Mix is dead!
Now get out

885
02:05:02,828 --> 02:05:06,958
Have you come to pay me tributes?
Where are the garlands, the bouquets?

886
02:05:07,633 --> 02:05:10,761
We'd like to know why you haven't
scored an album in four years?

887
02:05:12,037 --> 02:05:20,103
Four years ago... I was a star.
I was a thief, I stole songs

888
02:05:20,513 --> 02:05:25,746
At least I have the satisfaction
of not being a thief anymore

889
02:05:27,086 --> 02:05:30,954
That was KK-Mix
superhit singer and music director

890
02:05:35,728 --> 02:05:38,094
No, you haven't come
congratulating me...

891
02:05:38,831 --> 02:05:41,026
you've come to rub salt
into my wounds

892
02:05:41,834 --> 02:05:49,764
You want to make me realise that my
success was my illusion. Right...?

893
02:05:51,877 --> 02:05:56,610
I've been sitting at home and rotting
these four years. Only because of you

894
02:06:05,925 --> 02:06:11,227
Sitting at home doesn't kill art.
- I'm finished! I can't sing

895
02:06:20,539 --> 02:06:21,471
Go away

896
02:06:22,875 --> 02:06:24,809
You're superstitious, KK

897
02:06:28,581 --> 02:06:30,947
I never under-rated your voice,
I still don't

898
02:06:31,550 --> 02:06:34,815
You can sing a great song again.
And you'll outdo yourself...

899
02:06:35,220 --> 02:06:39,816
scoring your own music,
instead of stealing. I'm sure

900
02:06:42,895 --> 02:06:49,391
How...? How can a mind bent on
thieving score original music?

901
02:06:50,803 --> 02:06:56,139
Two lines for you to remember, KK.
Spring follows autumn

902
02:06:57,509 --> 02:06:59,443
And what use living
if you have accepted defeat?

903
02:07:05,618 --> 02:07:06,880
Hey, you said what...?

904
02:07:42,955 --> 02:07:47,892
What's life lived in defeat?

905
02:07:50,696 --> 02:07:59,900
"Lived to the last breath,
Life lives not in Death's fear"

906
02:08:15,721 --> 02:08:18,212
The Earth...

907
02:08:18,724 --> 02:08:21,352
the skies...

908
02:08:21,960 --> 02:08:28,092
"my heart... all resonate
with the resolve..."

909
02:08:28,901 --> 02:08:32,894
"to sing the song of love
even when I'm heartbroken..."

910
02:08:33,338 --> 02:08:36,899
the song of love...

911
02:08:44,249 --> 02:08:49,949
for what is life lived in defeat?

912
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:56,085
Dense black nights...

913
02:09:56,855 --> 02:09:59,415
will be bathed in moonlight

914
02:10:00,325 --> 02:10:04,887
"Somewhere in the dark,
you will find a ray"

915
02:10:09,868 --> 02:10:15,807
"Your life is no journey
through misery..."

916
02:10:16,341 --> 02:10:21,540
"pick from the thorns on your path
the path leading to your goal"

917
02:10:28,153 --> 02:10:33,750
For what is life lived in defeat?

918
02:10:54,746 --> 02:10:56,680
Mr Om, you've started
a music company?

919
02:10:56,849 --> 02:10:59,044
Yes, I'm offering you distribution

920
02:10:59,218 --> 02:11:01,948
Forgive me, I don't stock
new labels or small labels

921
02:11:02,354 --> 02:11:06,814
KK-Mix burnt out four years ago.
And what an album, "What's Life?"

922
02:11:07,226 --> 02:11:10,957
These songs don't sell.
And I won't annoy Mr Shekhar

923
02:11:11,997 --> 02:11:15,558
Mr Om! You...? Hello...

924
02:11:17,269 --> 02:11:21,262
You don't recognise me?
I remember you very well

925
02:11:22,007 --> 02:11:25,499
Can I ever forget a pirate?
- That's just as well

926
02:11:26,211 --> 02:11:32,548
Market news is, no one's willing to
distribute your label with KK-Mix

927
02:11:34,920 --> 02:11:36,854
But I can sell

928
02:11:39,291 --> 02:11:43,250
Until now, you only
trusted gentlemen

929
02:11:43,662 --> 02:11:45,596
For once, try out a scoundrel

930
02:11:49,968 --> 02:11:53,460
I will, if you stop pirating music

931
02:11:56,541 --> 02:12:01,706
Stipulating terms? Even in distress?
That makes me feel like agreeing

932
02:12:02,281 --> 02:12:06,012
Okay, God be my witness.
No more piracy

933
02:12:34,279 --> 02:12:35,746
How are you Papa?
Fine

934
02:12:36,148 --> 02:12:37,740
Shopping?
Not really

935
02:12:38,083 --> 02:12:39,880
Where's Jai?
At work

936
02:12:40,285 --> 02:12:42,014
In the junkyard?

937
02:12:42,988 --> 02:12:46,480
Are you cooking?
Just trying

938
02:12:49,161 --> 02:12:55,896
Just look at the way she looks.
Can you see beyond looks?

939
02:12:56,401 --> 02:12:59,893
I see a bad future for my daughter.
How are you returning?

940
02:13:00,339 --> 02:13:04,002
Jai's picking her up in a helicopter.
- We'll drop you

941
02:13:21,059 --> 02:13:27,020
I'm ashamed! He claims he's building
the fastest car in the world! Here?

942
02:13:43,582 --> 02:13:47,279
What's lacking here?
- We needn't suffer like this

943
02:13:49,354 --> 02:13:52,949
Problem is, you've lived comfortably.
You got no idea how difficult life is

944
02:13:53,358 --> 02:13:56,691
Why should I care? My parents
can give us a life of comfort

945
02:13:57,095 --> 02:14:02,397
For your comforts, not mine.
- You don't care for me

946
02:14:05,070 --> 02:14:08,335
If my determination is selfishness
do whatever you wish

947
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:12,605
Are you giving me an ultimatum?
- I'm trying to make you see reason

948
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:14,945
I don't want to see reason
I'm not living in this junkyard

949
02:14:15,347 --> 02:14:18,510
This is home! Not junkyard!
- Even that line is your brother's

950
02:15:16,641 --> 02:15:17,699
Hello Shekhar

951
02:15:19,111 --> 02:15:21,045
I'm Jai. From America

952
02:15:22,414 --> 02:15:24,678
Yes Jai, yo on.
Is Om in?

953
02:15:26,418 --> 02:15:27,942
Not right now

954
02:15:30,422 --> 02:15:37,351
I'll pay you back whatever
Om borrowed for my studies

955
02:16:26,478 --> 02:16:30,039
For you, free.
I Take Nothing for free

956
02:16:32,551 --> 02:16:34,416
Not even from me?

957
02:16:57,542 --> 02:17:02,980
I have disgraced my brother.
I'll try my best...

958
02:17:03,548 --> 02:17:09,487
to make him proud of me.
And only then will I go home

959
02:17:11,556 --> 02:17:16,493
I'm sure you will succeed
in your endeavours

960
02:17:17,429 --> 02:17:21,422
I know it sounds dramatic,
but I'm with you

961
02:17:21,866 --> 02:17:28,169
No use. Only a professional hacker or
some computer genius can solve this

962
02:17:36,248 --> 02:17:39,877
I'd like to see Mr Pillai.
He is in an important meeting

963
02:17:40,285 --> 02:17:44,278
This is regarding that meeting.
- No sir, you can't see him

964
02:17:45,223 --> 02:17:47,885
Tell him I'll take no more than
a hundred seconds

965
02:17:48,293 --> 02:17:50,488
Call him, he knows me.
Okay...

966
02:17:51,096 --> 02:17:56,500
The best of our engineers couldn't
protect our site from hackers. Why?

967
02:18:09,314 --> 02:18:12,545
So how can you help me
all in a hundred seconds?

968
02:18:12,984 --> 02:18:15,214
If I may use your computer...?

969
02:18:54,793 --> 02:18:58,559
He takes this for a pizza shop,
not a software company

970
02:19:20,418 --> 02:19:22,181
My job's over too

971
02:19:24,556 --> 02:19:33,328
All in a hundred seconds, this system
can track hackers and stop them

972
02:20:06,765 --> 02:20:11,702
Puja, I am certain I will succeed
in whatever I'm attempting

973
02:20:13,605 --> 02:20:15,698
One minute... it's a wish

974
02:20:23,882 --> 02:20:30,685
Jagadish, today's a lucky day.
Whatever you wish will come true

975
02:20:48,506 --> 02:20:50,406
What wish did you make?

976
02:20:53,711 --> 02:21:00,310
May Om and Jai be given every wish
they make today

977
02:21:01,519 --> 02:21:03,214
What about yourself?

978
02:21:11,596 --> 02:21:13,496
I've been given my wish

979
02:21:17,635 --> 02:21:21,696
This is the rose you gave me

980
02:22:32,277 --> 02:22:34,404
Secretly, I stole one look at you

981
02:22:35,446 --> 02:22:37,414
Secretly, I have loved you

982
02:22:38,182 --> 02:22:40,446
Secretly, I have prayed for you

983
02:22:41,052 --> 02:22:45,386
Secretly, I have worshipped you

984
02:22:46,591 --> 02:22:50,357
But you wouldn't know...

985
02:22:52,463 --> 02:22:56,524
how dearly I have loved you

986
02:23:04,275 --> 02:23:08,109
Oh how do I tell you...

987
02:23:10,214 --> 02:23:14,344
"how, when and where
I gave you my heart"

988
02:23:22,026 --> 02:23:25,587
You wouldn't know...

989
02:23:27,899 --> 02:23:32,836
how dearly I have loved you

990
02:23:39,844 --> 02:23:43,678
Oh how do I tell you...

991
02:23:45,617 --> 02:23:49,178
"how, when and where
I gave you my heart"

992
02:24:28,192 --> 02:24:32,128
Did you hear what I said?

993
02:24:33,731 --> 02:24:35,995
My love...

994
02:24:36,834 --> 02:24:43,637
"it's you I've chosen.
- I love those words"

995
02:24:45,877 --> 02:24:50,940
"My dream seems to be
coming true"

996
02:24:52,283 --> 02:24:55,946
Oh how do I tell you how I feel?

997
02:24:58,156 --> 02:25:01,421
"You've taken the peace
out of my life"

998
02:25:49,073 --> 02:25:50,335
Secretly...

999
02:25:50,775 --> 02:25:55,678
"do not steal glances at me
from afar..."

1000
02:25:56,781 --> 02:26:01,013
make me yours

1001
02:26:02,687 --> 02:26:07,021
In my obsession, I know...

1002
02:26:08,793 --> 02:26:13,196
"now we will be together,
forever"

1003
02:26:15,266 --> 02:26:18,963
"Darling, how can I keep
this a secret from you?"

1004
02:26:20,972 --> 02:26:25,170
You are my lover

1005
02:26:33,084 --> 02:26:37,020
But you wouldn't know...

1006
02:26:38,790 --> 02:26:43,022
how dearly I have loved you

1007
02:28:18,189 --> 02:28:21,420
Many thanks, many many thanks

1008
02:28:22,360 --> 02:28:24,453
Congratulations Mr KK.
Congratulations Mr Om

1009
02:28:24,862 --> 02:28:27,330
Asha Bhosle has agreed to sing
for our company

1010
02:28:29,166 --> 02:28:31,760
Nearly every artiste
is with us

1011
02:28:43,214 --> 02:28:48,151
What worse a blow for Shekhar?
In one fell sweep...

1012
02:28:49,220 --> 02:28:51,814
This is fun!
Rehman...

1013
02:28:53,224 --> 02:28:58,218
enjoy your victories. Don't compare
your successes with others' failures

1014
02:28:59,363 --> 02:29:06,201
But the man took your house...
- I've stopped turning to look back

1015
02:29:10,608 --> 02:29:15,875
Inform all the singers. They'll get
a share of 25 percent of our profits

1016
02:29:24,355 --> 02:29:27,415
I'm here to congratulate you
on your success

1017
02:29:27,992 --> 02:29:31,928
But I won't lie. It hurt.
After all, I'm human

1018
02:29:33,297 --> 02:29:36,323
Kavita wants to talk.
Kavita Krishnamurthy

1019
02:29:37,101 --> 02:29:40,229
I'll call her back.
- He'll call her back

1020
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:46,737
The man who worked for me,
the man who was my friend...

1021
02:29:47,144 --> 02:29:49,942
the man whom I financed...

1022
02:29:50,348 --> 02:29:55,081
is the man who invades my business
and makes me lose money, betrays me

1023
02:29:57,221 --> 02:30:02,682
But he will always talk
of being cultured! Outrageous

1024
02:30:03,527 --> 02:30:09,090
And what has he got to show for
valuing love more than money?

1025
02:30:09,500 --> 02:30:13,596
Slap-on-the-face
from his brothers

1026
02:30:14,105 --> 02:30:17,438
And what do the brothers come out
to be? Self-seeking scoundrels

1027
02:30:18,342 --> 02:30:22,073
I'm right, am I not Om?
Tell me, isn't that true?

1028
02:30:45,569 --> 02:30:49,335
There are two parties
to the truth

1029
02:30:50,141 --> 02:30:53,508
One, who can speak the truth
and one, who can hear the truth

1030
02:30:55,279 --> 02:30:59,682
The truth is, love and friendship
are words that mean nothing to you

1031
02:31:00,418 --> 02:31:03,353
All you know is money's might
because...

1032
02:31:03,754 --> 02:31:07,019
you are devoid of humane feelings.
The truth is...

1033
02:31:07,425 --> 02:31:11,361
men like us can pick up their lives
from anywhere

1034
02:31:11,896 --> 02:31:15,059
Because we're unafraid of ourselves
for we do not lie to ourselves

1035
02:31:16,967 --> 02:31:20,334
But men like you live
only in the realm of lies

1036
02:31:23,407 --> 02:31:27,605
You are afraid of yourself,
afraid of your failures

1037
02:31:29,413 --> 02:31:33,679
The truth is also, that my brothers
still live in my heart

1038
02:31:34,452 --> 02:31:40,413
What we share isn't only blood ties.
What binds us together is emotion

1039
02:31:41,325 --> 02:31:45,352
Of love, of togetherness,
and our upbringing

1040
02:31:47,431 --> 02:31:51,367
I will destroy your dreams
of magnanimity. I'll show you...

1041
02:31:52,203 --> 02:31:58,665
what money's might means.
You slapped Shekhar Malhotra's ego

1042
02:32:06,183 --> 02:32:10,586
I will put to auction
in the marketplace your temple

1043
02:32:14,492 --> 02:32:16,756
Advertise the auction

1044
02:32:18,596 --> 02:32:21,793
I will destroy Saraswati Audio.
I'll make a pauper out of Om Batra

1045
02:32:23,434 --> 02:32:30,101
Slash prices. I don't care.
We have money, he has nothing

1046
02:33:07,244 --> 02:33:09,769
I've done it, Om

1047
02:33:13,717 --> 02:33:17,175
This is Jai Batra.
He has designed the fastest car

1048
02:33:27,331 --> 02:33:29,231
Sure, I'm ready
for the engine tests

1049
02:34:08,606 --> 02:34:13,339
Shekhar, Jai here.
I'm returning to India

1050
02:34:14,311 --> 02:34:18,247
To pay back what Om owes you.
Sure Jai. Welcome back To India

1051
02:34:19,350 --> 02:34:27,018
But don't come to return my money,
come and save your house

1052
02:34:27,558 --> 02:34:29,492
I'm auctioning your house

1053
02:35:14,571 --> 02:35:16,505
He was hiding this all along

1054
02:35:20,611 --> 02:35:22,670
He thinks his brother is worthless?

1055
02:35:25,316 --> 02:35:27,250
He wants to fight it himself?

1056
02:35:27,685 --> 02:35:29,619
Why were you hiding this from me?

1057
02:35:30,621 --> 02:35:33,988
Om! You were a father to me!
You were my father

1058
02:35:36,894 --> 02:35:39,624
Why did you tear yourself from me?

1059
02:35:42,800 --> 02:35:44,734
I'm yourJagadish

1060
02:35:50,441 --> 02:35:52,375
I'm yours! Jagadish

1061
02:36:39,790 --> 02:36:41,724
I got something to tell you

1062
02:36:45,863 --> 02:36:49,629
I have sold my engine design
for 2 million dollars

1063
02:36:55,539 --> 02:36:57,473
Don't you want to know
why I sold it?

1064
02:36:59,743 --> 02:37:04,680
For my sake? I mean... for our sake
for the sake of our future

1065
02:37:05,482 --> 02:37:09,475
Yes Nitu. But the future for us
lies in India

1066
02:37:09,987 --> 02:37:16,153
In India...?
Our house is being auctioned

1067
02:37:21,465 --> 02:37:23,399
I'm going back to India

1068
02:37:27,538 --> 02:37:29,472
Will you come with me?

1069
02:37:59,503 --> 02:38:01,437
Jai, take care of yourself

1070
02:38:12,816 --> 02:38:15,512
Nitu, you never wanted
to marry...

1071
02:38:15,953 --> 02:38:20,356
someone who was weak,
a man without a backbone

1072
02:38:23,427 --> 02:38:25,952
All along I knew, you were
hinting at me

1073
02:38:28,432 --> 02:38:32,869
But what are you doing now?
Jai is a man of substance

1074
02:38:34,505 --> 02:38:39,408
You'd like him to become like me?
Feeble, spineless...?

1075
02:38:41,712 --> 02:38:47,742
Look, someone who doesn't
value relationships remains a loner

1076
02:38:48,852 --> 02:38:55,758
You want to be lonely all your life?
- Lonely...? Why, we're with her

1077
02:39:06,870 --> 02:39:07,996
Jai...

1078
02:39:10,574 --> 02:39:11,802
son...

1079
02:39:17,548 --> 02:39:19,482
like you make cars...

1080
02:39:19,950 --> 02:39:21,884
now make a life for yourself

1081
02:39:22,753 --> 02:39:25,153
The streetcar called life
doesn't run on a lone wheel

1082
02:39:26,890 --> 02:39:28,824
Takes two wheels

1083
02:40:14,004 --> 02:40:18,839
Once quality is approved, we'll
send it to the purchase department

1084
02:40:21,044 --> 02:40:24,241
Have you thought up a name for this?
Yes sir

1085
02:40:24,648 --> 02:40:27,879
What?
Om

1086
02:40:28,752 --> 02:40:32,244
Making money isn't so easy Tanya,
particularly in our times

1087
02:40:32,656 --> 02:40:35,250
Now is the time when making money
has become easier

1088
02:40:35,659 --> 02:40:38,890
Not labour, all it takes is brains
to make money

1089
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:41,564
And the three brothers
have ample of brains

1090
02:40:41,965 --> 02:40:46,334
What if they turn up with the money?
- Then I'll do a volte face

1091
02:40:49,006 --> 02:40:53,238
I own the house. What I sell it for,
20 million or 200 million is upto me

1092
02:41:02,019 --> 02:41:04,044
What are you doing here
so late at night?

1093
02:41:05,722 --> 02:41:12,025
After your Daddy passed away,
I never pieced my life together

1094
02:41:12,763 --> 02:41:19,430
It's a feeling. In only I could die
in that house...

1095
02:41:20,003 --> 02:41:23,564
maybe I would be re-united
with your father

1096
02:41:25,709 --> 02:41:30,271
Can that ever be?
If that can't be...

1097
02:41:31,882 --> 02:41:33,816
nothing else can be

1098
02:41:48,031 --> 02:41:51,091
KK... - Yes, tell me

1099
02:41:52,069 --> 02:41:56,802
How much is our bank balance?
- About 65 million

1100
02:42:08,318 --> 02:42:11,719
Friends, thank you for attending
this auction

1101
02:42:13,623 --> 02:42:18,754
Amidst Juhu's concrete jungle is
Gul Mohar Villa. Like a blossom

1102
02:42:19,763 --> 02:42:27,329
Given the money, a priceless piece
of real estate can be yours

1103
02:42:28,271 --> 02:42:35,473
Satya Prakash Batra, a Pakistani
refugee, bought it for 25000 in 1942

1104
02:42:36,079 --> 02:42:41,016
I would like the bidding
to start from 25,000

1105
02:42:42,786 --> 02:42:45,482
Let the auction begin

1106
02:42:46,890 --> 02:42:47,822
One minute

1107
02:42:51,862 --> 02:42:53,727
Mr Shekhar Malhotra's floor price...

1108
02:42:54,097 --> 02:42:58,693
is in keeping with his paucity
of ideas as well as his lowly status

1109
02:42:59,636 --> 02:43:03,299
What the value of this house is
no one knows better than I do

1110
02:43:07,043 --> 02:43:08,271
50 million

1111
02:43:16,052 --> 02:43:17,417
55 million

1112
02:43:19,156 --> 02:43:20,418
60 million

1113
02:43:25,962 --> 02:43:27,361
65 million

1114
02:43:36,940 --> 02:43:38,032
70 million

1115
02:43:43,980 --> 02:43:49,077
Well Mr Om Batra...?
Is your status lowlier than yours?

1116
02:43:51,154 --> 02:43:53,418
If you can't bid,
why are you still here?

1117
02:43:59,162 --> 02:44:00,424
70 million

1118
02:44:04,167 --> 02:44:05,498
75 million

1119
02:44:44,207 --> 02:44:45,469
85 million

1120
02:44:54,985 --> 02:44:56,452
You're back...?

1121
02:44:56,953 --> 02:44:57,544
90 million

1122
02:44:57,888 --> 02:45:01,153
Jai has to come back, hasn't he?
Sorry, I'm a bit late

1123
02:45:01,658 --> 02:45:05,685
No, not at all.
Not at all, Jai

1124
02:45:12,269 --> 02:45:14,965
You're thin.
Me?

1125
02:45:15,605 --> 02:45:16,537
95 million

1126
02:45:17,007 --> 02:45:20,670
Maybe because
I missed the meals Ma cooks

1127
02:45:22,345 --> 02:45:23,539
How's Ma?

1128
02:45:25,081 --> 02:45:27,777
Ma is all right

1129
02:45:30,220 --> 02:45:34,316
She doesn't know angthing
about this house being auctioned

1130
02:45:38,128 --> 02:45:39,493
100 million

1131
02:45:47,037 --> 02:45:48,299
110 million

1132
02:45:55,011 --> 02:45:56,410
115 million

1133
02:46:00,083 --> 02:46:01,209
120 million

1134
02:46:06,056 --> 02:46:11,790
How did you make so much money?
- Sold my design. For 2m dollars

1135
02:46:16,399 --> 02:46:21,666
You sold your dream
to give us our dreams?

1136
02:46:24,274 --> 02:46:28,176
Dreams... reality...
I've come to know the difference

1137
02:46:30,146 --> 02:46:31,204
125 million

1138
02:46:35,452 --> 02:46:36,646
130 million

1139
02:46:39,990 --> 02:46:40,922
140 million

1140
02:46:41,291 --> 02:46:43,020
140 million and One Rupee

1141
02:47:01,044 --> 02:47:02,272
145 million

1142
02:47:34,244 --> 02:47:35,472
150 million

1143
02:47:44,487 --> 02:47:45,613
155 million

1144
02:47:46,056 --> 02:47:48,684
Jai! You still look like
you're only from Mumbai

1145
02:47:54,431 --> 02:47:57,093
I want to touch your feet

1146
02:47:57,367 --> 02:47:58,629
160 million

1147
02:48:07,410 --> 02:48:08,741
170 million

1148
02:48:13,750 --> 02:48:15,342
200 million

1149
02:48:44,114 --> 02:48:48,710
I have something special for you.
I would like you to receive...

1150
02:48:49,119 --> 02:48:52,020
the papers from the hands of
the original owner of this property

1151
02:48:52,422 --> 02:48:55,357
Mrs Saraswati Batra

1152
02:49:23,486 --> 02:49:25,215
Ma, forgive us

1153
02:49:26,256 --> 02:49:29,589
We couldn't save our home, not even
the three of us put together

1154
02:49:55,552 --> 02:49:59,784
I'm sorry, but your house
is no more yours

1155
02:50:06,629 --> 02:50:14,536
Be it lives, be it property,
one day it all ends

1156
02:50:16,606 --> 02:50:19,803
What survives is love

1157
02:50:21,678 --> 02:50:29,016
Love, that I see in the eyes
of my sons

1158
02:50:33,623 --> 02:50:41,052
My three sons and their love
for each other. Exemplary

1159
02:50:43,633 --> 02:50:48,002
Today, it isn't a home
that I lost...

1160
02:50:48,471 --> 02:50:51,201
it's a home that
I've found once again

1161
02:50:54,510 --> 02:51:00,210
Shekhar, my home isn't in those
pieces of paper

1162
02:51:03,086 --> 02:51:05,213
There is my home...

1163
02:51:06,489 --> 02:51:12,359
where my sons stand, wherever
they stand... is home for me

1164
02:51:14,797 --> 02:51:23,535
To the world outside, they are
three. To me, they are the same...

1165
02:51:26,609 --> 02:51:36,109
three names I gave to my love,
Om, Jai and Jagadish

1166
02:51:44,627 --> 02:51:49,121
Mr Sabharwal, receive your papers
from Mrs Saraswati Batra

1167
02:51:49,565 --> 02:51:55,026
If you insist that the real owner
must hand over the papers...

1168
02:51:55,471 --> 02:52:00,170
let the real owner collect them.
- You aren't the real bidder?

1169
02:52:00,576 --> 02:52:04,410
No, I was only bidding for him.
Who is he

1170
02:52:30,506 --> 02:52:33,600
But how did you make so much money?
Allow me to tell you

1171
02:52:41,684 --> 02:52:45,814
MrJagadish Batra has developed Om
a software to prevent hacking

1172
02:52:49,258 --> 02:52:55,629
His price was the bid price
for buying the house back

1173
02:53:06,976 --> 02:53:12,278
So MrJagadish Batra, now I own Om.
The house is yours

1174
02:53:13,750 --> 02:53:15,240
I knew...

1175
02:53:16,619 --> 02:53:19,315
someday, even my bad pennies
would pay me off

1176
02:53:59,762 --> 02:54:01,389
Om was right

1177
02:54:03,833 --> 02:54:07,496
Love is mightier than money

1178
02:54:14,710 --> 02:54:16,143
Om...
Yes

1179
02:54:16,579 --> 02:54:21,016
I'm not too fluent in Hindi.
But there's a saying about...

1180
02:54:21,417 --> 02:54:24,875
the return of a prodigal child.
- Who's this child...?

1181
02:54:27,490 --> 02:54:28,479
Nitu
