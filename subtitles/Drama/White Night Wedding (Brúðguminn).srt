1
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:38,664
Do you, Jon Jonsson,

2
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:44,075
take Thora to be your
lawful wedded wife?

3
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,141
Yes.

4
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:53,851
Will you, with God's help,
be faithful to her,

5
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:59,917
honor and respect her
through all that God may bring?

6
00:00:59,959 --> 00:01:01,017
Yeah, sure.

7
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:08,591
Do you, Thora Larusdottir,

8
00:01:08,635 --> 00:01:12,935
take Jon to be
your lawful wedded...

9
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:13,996
Yes.

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,337
...husband?
- Yes

11
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:20,202
The rings are a token
of your love and devotion.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,012
It's the left hand.

13
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:38,054
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

14
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:40,066
You may kiss the bride.

15
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,707
Jon...

16
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,744
Excuse me,
I have to take this.

17
00:01:57,317 --> 00:01:59,148
Jon! It's Dad.

18
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:00,979
Dad...

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,387
Your mother is completely lost.

20
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,825
- Where did you say we were?
- Kerlingarskard.

21
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:12,231
Dad, hold on a second...
Can we proceed?

22
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:14,323
- You may kiss the bride.
- Right.

23
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:16,928
Dad, I'll call you back.

24
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,631
We've just gone
a little bit too far...

25
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:22,701
You have no idea where we are.

26
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,836
I'm in the church.
I have to kiss the bride.

27
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:32,507
You said Midsummer night.
That's tomorrow.

28
00:02:32,552 --> 00:02:35,282
It's a rehearsal.
I'll call back later.

29
00:02:37,423 --> 00:02:38,549
Sorry.

30
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,750
Mom, stop it.

31
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,261
- I didn't say a word!
- Just stop it.

32
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,763
Where were we?

33
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,290
You may kiss the bride.

34
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,300
Thanks.

35
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,105
...and all that.

36
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:00,744
What did he say?

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,944
He was in the church...
rehearsing.

38
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:06,915
Rehearsing?

39
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,745
It's not like he is doing it
for the first time.

40
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,755
On one hand we have
the persona of the doctor,

41
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,757
the honest man.

42
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,760
In his mind there are no 'ifs' -

43
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:59,027
It is simply wrong
to betray your wife.

44
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:03,363
That's the moral 'absolutism'
of Kant.

45
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:08,363
Betrayal is wrong...

46
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,706
No matter what
the circumstances.

47
00:05:14,447 --> 00:05:16,915
The other guy thinks
he's doing what's best,

48
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,644
what leads to the best consequences.

49
00:05:18,685 --> 00:05:20,175
It's possible.

50
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:23,450
The end justifies the means
is the author's point then?

51
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:27,983
We shouldn't assume
we know the author's point...

52
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,793
but we definitely
have two opposites.

53
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,734
The doctor and then
the protagonist, the landowner,

54
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:43,140
who betrays his wife
in hope of a better life.

55
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,907
A consequientialist, if you will...

56
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:49,915
The end justifies the means.

57
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:55,717
We could also define it
as graded absolutism.

58
00:05:55,755 --> 00:06:01,489
Things aren't right or wrong,
as the doctor says.

59
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,724
They are relatively wrong
or relatively right,

60
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:08,200
depending on the circumstances.

61
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:13,035
It is wrong to steal,
but worse to starve your child.

62
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:44,662
The landowner
intends to save his life

63
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:47,036
even if it means
he has to betray his wife.

64
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,773
To save a man's life,
in this case his own,

65
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:57,840
is more important to him
than being faithful to his wife.

66
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Does it have to be
so complicated?

67
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,885
Isn't love always justifiable?

68
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:07,358
That's an oversimplification...

69
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,061
I just think your explanation

70
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,326
is unnecessarily
long and complicated.

71
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:20,731
Maybe you are right,
perhaps it is...

72
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:24,209
long and unnecessary.

73
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:46,125
Do you need saving?

74
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,030
What?
No. I'm safe.

75
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,557
Are you sure?

76
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,626
Sure of what?

77
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:52,765
My love

78
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:06,919
Yes?

79
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,677
Why don't you answer?

80
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,155
The phone was off.
What is it?

81
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,715
Oh, God...

82
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,953
I had an accident.

83
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,961
An accident?

84
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,896
I didn't see him,
I was driving and...

85
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:20,626
Calm down, Anna.

86
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,361
Don't start with that.
I am calm.

87
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:24,028
I was driving down...

88
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,402
I can't hear you when you shout.

89
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:30,739
I am not shouting!
Just listen to me - I hit a swan!

90
00:08:30,776 --> 00:08:33,836
- Hit what?
- Or a goose or something!

91
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,747
A swan? A bird?
And are you all right?

92
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,943
Yes, but...

93
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:41,553
Could I have a quick word?

94
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,447
You're all right, aren't you?

95
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,849
Yes, I'm fine.

96
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,995
All right, darling.
See you when I get home.

97
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,129
Bye, sweetheart.

98
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,749
Thank you, Reverend.

99
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:15,454
Well, say your goodbyes for now.

100
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,079
Yes.

101
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:19,921
- You'll make the house cozy for us?
- Sure.

102
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:22,086
And you can't see me
until tomorrow.

103
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:23,861
Makes it more fun.

104
00:09:26,465 --> 00:09:29,263
It'll be just like the first time.

105
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:40,868
- Tell him to come and see me.
- I will. Just take it easy.

106
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:43,871
Mom!

107
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:49,052
Sisi wants you to stop by today.

108
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,283
We have to settle things
before the wedding.

109
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:56,053
I have to pick up
a friend from the ferry.

110
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,022
We're just waiting
for that subsidy.

111
00:09:59,065 --> 00:10:01,033
That's great,
see you later today then.

112
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:04,400
Come in through the kitchen
so Thora won't run into you.

113
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,404
Right.

114
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:13,409
Thanks...
See you tomorrow.

115
00:10:13,913 --> 00:10:16,905
I suppose so.

116
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,367
Thanks for dinner.

117
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,969
Wild game?

118
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,059
- Anna...
- I want to go home.

119
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:18,230
- What do you mean?
- Home.

120
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,991
I love you.

121
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:55,231
For having the courage.

122
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,643
For sacrificing.

123
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,180
Sacrificing?

124
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:10,088
Resigning and starting all over again.

125
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,590
Hi, Malla. Are you sure
you picked the right numbers?

126
00:13:53,632 --> 00:13:55,361
I'm not talking to you.
You're bad luck.

127
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,570
Congratulations on the new wife.

128
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,697
Thanks.

129
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:02,366
Coming on strong into second- half!

130
00:14:02,408 --> 00:14:04,774
It was time to get back into the game.

131
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,710
How much younger than you?

132
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,875
- Eighteen years.
- Ouch, you're such a bad boy!

133
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,214
She is an old soul
and I'm young at heart.

134
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:18,313
So no hope there either?

135
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,984
You haven't changed a bit.

136
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,721
- You're graying.
- And you've lost weight.

137
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,194
- Do you think so?
- No.

138
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,665
All dressed up already?

139
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,601
The wedding is tomorrow.
We're not going to sleep, are we?

140
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,066
- No luggage?
- What for?

141
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:40,277
- Get in.
- Wow, nice!

142
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,507
There are no cars on the island.

143
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,415
- Do you think it will hold?
- Sure. It's American.

144
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:48,420
Made for heavyweight
burger bottoms.

145
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,381
Take it easy though.

146
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:55,889
Thanks for coming.

147
00:14:55,928 --> 00:14:58,761
Somebody has to play the organ
at your wedding.

148
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,424
What are you playing?

149
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,525
I don't know, maybe...

150
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,197
He's got the gray hair blues!

151
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:10,265
He's got the gray hair blues...

152
00:15:24,823 --> 00:15:28,725
- Who's the nutter?
- Who? Malla?

153
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,922
I saw her spend a fortune
on lottery tickets.

154
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,396
She's kind of fixed
on the lottery.

155
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,989
She's a freak!

156
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,397
- Freak!
- Stop it!

157
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,667
- You're staying at my place.
- Oh?

158
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:45,075
Thora is staying at
her mother's guesthouse tonight.

159
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,442
Already staying at her mother's?

160
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,073
It's a tradition.
I can't see her until the wedding.

161
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,905
Cute...

162
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:56,251
So we can share
a few old stories.

163
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,415
We sure can.

164
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:00,357
Remember the year
we left college?

165
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,416
Yeah.

166
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,361
Must have been the same year
your wife got potty trained.

167
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:21,806
So your roots lie here in Flatey,
like mine?

168
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:24,145
My parents grew up here.

169
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:27,983
So you're related to
Anna of Hvammur,

170
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,048
who was married to Gudberg,
father of Asberg the magistrate,

171
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:39,793
who married Gudfinna and
then later her sister Gudmunda!

172
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,322
That's possible.

173
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:44,200
I'll say. Welcome back home, cousin.

174
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:49,201
If there is anything I can do
just let me know.

175
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:54,235
I have plenty of time
to attend to my parish.

176
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,473
Thank you.

177
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,745
And you know about
the collection box.

178
00:16:58,784 --> 00:17:01,753
We are raising money
to fix the altarpiece...

179
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,522
My piano!
It's here!

180
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,465
Good day to you all.

181
00:17:36,688 --> 00:17:37,916
Howdy, Reverend.

182
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:39,919
Thanks so much.

183
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,983
Faith moves mountains.
I take care of the rest.

184
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,628
I've got to get going.

185
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:49,896
- Reverend!
- Yes.

186
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,532
A new helmet?

187
00:17:55,374 --> 00:17:57,205
Pure ecstasy.

188
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,933
I'll only be a minute.

189
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,173
Do they sell cigarettes here?

190
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,573
I think so.

191
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,429
Jesus Christ!

192
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,396
I'm sorry...
Larus said you wanted to see me.

193
00:19:06,512 --> 00:19:08,377
What is there to discuss?

194
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,673
Unless you're here
to pay your debt.

195
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:16,948
- I was about to bring that up.
- Really?

196
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:22,927
- Are four jars of jam enough?
- No, it's not enough!

197
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:26,221
Tell Thora to stay out of the kitchen
while Jon is here.

198
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,626
Right.

199
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,901
- Want to buy something?
- Just cigarettes.

200
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:38,868
How many?

201
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:41,675
Many? Two packets.

202
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,548
Two times twenty...

203
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,654
You do sell cigarettes in packets,
don't you?

204
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,187
Just taking down
the numbers you use.

205
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:58,924
1200.

206
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:00,295
What? 1200?

207
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,206
Wow!
What's your shoe size?

208
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:11,669
Fifty, why?

209
00:20:12,344 --> 00:20:13,936
Half and half is one.

210
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:17,007
- Excuse me?
- A meter.

211
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,073
What?

212
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:21,347
Each foot is half a meter
so together they are one meter.

213
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,480
Freak.

214
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,456
The tourist board...

215
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:31,587
Have you lost your mind?

216
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,120
...promised us a subsidy.

217
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,531
If you think you can
take advantage of us

218
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,297
the day before
marrying my daughter!

219
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,736
This is not the best time...

220
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,329
This is completely unacceptable.

221
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:46,675
I am trying to run a business.
I was expecting this money.

222
00:20:53,685 --> 00:20:58,213
Any decent man
would have settled the debt

223
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,225
before proposing to my daughter!

224
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:03,087
Is it such a big deal?

225
00:21:03,128 --> 00:21:06,586
Honor our agreement
or I'll get a lawyer.

226
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,700
Why not get someone
to rough me up, make me pay?

227
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:13,535
I'll do it if I have to.

228
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,670
If you don't pay by tomorrow...

229
00:21:17,709 --> 00:21:21,509
the wedding will be called off!

230
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:28,778
- Is everything all right?
- I'm having a hard time breathing.

231
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:32,182
- I'm sorry, I just...
- Mom!

232
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:41,728
He seduces our daughter
and then tries to swindle us.

233
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,261
- That womanizer from hell.
- What's going on?

234
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,567
Ask your father!

235
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,677
Hello...

236
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:56,474
Yes, I can hear you.

237
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:02,779
What? I can't hear you now.

238
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,288
Dad?

239
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,787
Damn!

240
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,799
Do you mind
if I smoke in the car?

241
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,800
Suit yourself.

242
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,938
Nine holes?
A golf course has eighteen, right?

243
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:32,270
It's half a course.
You just go two rounds.

244
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,477
This is quite a project?

245
00:23:35,514 --> 00:23:39,883
Not that big -
thirty, forty maybe.

246
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,715
- Thirty, forty?
- Million.

247
00:23:42,854 --> 00:23:47,882
You'll get your money back
in about five years and after that,

248
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,053
pure ecstasy.

249
00:23:51,997 --> 00:23:55,933
You start on the reef,
hit over to the second hole.

250
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,894
This is the graveyard,
two bunkers, sand traps...

251
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,738
So you have to shoot
over the graveyard?

252
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:07,643
Or over the church.
No challenge, no fun!

253
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,749
The third hole
is on Lalli and Sisi's land.

254
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,082
Lalli and Sisi?

255
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,115
Sisi and Lalli.

256
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,157
That's our land, isn't it?

257
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,966
That's the idea.
Jon will be renting your land.

258
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:34,671
- Me?
- Really?

259
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,401
Isn't that so?

260
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:41,375
Well, a man has got
to keep himself busy, right?

261
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:47,346
He'll cut the grass for you,
you get the hay and also the rent.

262
00:24:47,385 --> 00:24:52,118
The guesthouse fills up with golfers
and everybody profits!

263
00:24:53,124 --> 00:24:55,354
We have to make a toast to that!

264
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,624
What do you think you're doing?

265
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:04,328
Put it on Jon's tab.
We have to celebrate.

266
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:05,700
Jon's tab?

267
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:08,906
Pure ecstasy.

268
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,772
It's a birdie!

269
00:25:18,884 --> 00:25:21,751
What a stupid place
to start a golf course.

270
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:25,813
This isn't for beginners, you know.

271
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:34,064
I've been trying to help Jon
make some money.

272
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,932
But no, he won't have that.

273
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:40,734
- Why don't you want to make money?
- We're getting there.

274
00:25:40,772 --> 00:25:45,300
Getting where?
So when do I get paid?

275
00:25:45,343 --> 00:25:52,511
- Pay you?
- We have to advertise, put up a website.

276
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,520
When we get the subsidy.

277
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:59,922
Grants and handouts!
Just like in the Soviet, Comrade Jon.

278
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:05,128
He's against tourists.
They are the future.

279
00:26:09,935 --> 00:26:15,032
- What are you doing, darling?
- Just touching up the wedding dress.

280
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,770
- Do you like it?
- It's nice.

281
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:29,987
It feels like I just got married yesterday.
How time flies.

282
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,980
Your dad was so cute, tall and thin.

283
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,352
We were so young.

284
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:47,062
Doing everything together,
the first apartment,

285
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,902
our first loan.

286
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:04,049
Darling, are you sure
you're doing the right thing?

287
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:13,720
You're missing out on so much.
Just stepping into his old life.

288
00:27:13,765 --> 00:27:18,099
I don't have to do everything like you.
It's not the only way.

289
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,764
- The man is turning gray.
- So what?

290
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:24,172
Maybe it's all right now.
But then you get to my age.

291
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:29,235
- What about children?
- Stop it, please.

292
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:35,377
I'm close to blowing
the whole thing off.

293
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,753
What's wrong with you?
You can't cancel my wedding.

294
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:41,350
We'll just go to Reykjavik
and get married there.

295
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,139
What did I say wrong now?

296
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:04,245
We have enough goddamn tourists.
Naked Germans all over the place.

297
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,979
There's more of them
than the bloody sheep.

298
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,316
Hairy old German hags
in every hotspring.

299
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:12,450
We can just as well
skin them, can't we?

300
00:28:12,891 --> 00:28:14,825
Skin the hide of their backs!

301
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,157
You guys are lacking...

302
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:21,859
What do you call it?
Entre... preneur... thing!

303
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:26,032
Entrepreneurship!

304
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:28,599
That's what I said!

305
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,837
I may not have a diploma
to wipe up my ass

306
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:38,144
but I've sure got...
the entrepreneur... shit working.

307
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:42,213
Please give me some
of that entrepreneurshit!

308
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,853
Start by taking a sea bath.

309
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:57,266
Learn to swim,
to get rid of that lifesaver.

310
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:59,270
Don't get him all worked up.

311
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,035
It's freezing!

312
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,444
Just wait for the tide.

313
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:35,663
- Guys...
- What?

314
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,301
- I can't find...
- What?

315
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:41,201
I can't find...

316
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:43,305
my willy.

317
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,644
It's gone!

318
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,379
Free Willy!

319
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:01,493
- Hi, darling.
- Hi.

320
00:30:01,533 --> 00:30:04,001
- Still awake?
- Just blogging.

321
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,733
- I just wanted to say good night.
- Good night.

322
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:18,348
- Is something wrong?
- No, just...

323
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:22,080
- Just what?
- Nothing.

324
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:26,287
- All right, good night then.
- Dad?

325
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:27,450
Yes.

326
00:30:33,131 --> 00:30:34,894
It's just Jon...

327
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,634
He's been acting strange lately.

328
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:45,336
What if he... doesn't love me?

329
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,338
My dear little girl.

330
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,813
Don't get mad, but...

331
00:30:57,488 --> 00:31:01,424
it's been such a short time since Anna.

332
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,096
And he's so much older than you.

333
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,325
Why is it impossible
to talk to you all?

334
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:11,563
He's having a hard time
and he needs me.

335
00:31:11,603 --> 00:31:13,332
But you don't need him.

336
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,033
I've made up my mind.
I'm marrying him.

337
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:19,738
I've known it
since I first met him.

338
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:34,083
Well, darling, of course
you have to follow your heart.

339
00:31:34,125 --> 00:31:37,993
- Yes, of course.
- Right.

340
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,199
What was I thinking?

341
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,642
- The terns are quiet tonight.
- Yes... Thank you.

342
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:39,957
- Are all the drawings yours?
- Yes.

343
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,656
Well, they're really...

344
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:47,153
really... something.

345
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,213
Are you going to pay or not?

346
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:15,089
- Not now, later.
- We want our money now.

347
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:18,061
No money, money tomorrow,
plenty of money tomorrow.

348
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:19,063
Wait a moment.

349
00:33:19,097 --> 00:33:21,463
- Bloody hell!
- Bloody hell yourself!

350
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,131
- Help me out here?
- What do you want me to say?

351
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,602
Just something.
You're a professor.

352
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,040
Isn't that what you
do for a living?

353
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:33,737
Hey, Polish guys, talk to my friend.
He is the boss.

354
00:33:33,978 --> 00:33:36,503
Careful, it's brand new!

355
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:46,486
- Are you paying us, Mr. Big Boss?
- It's a little bit...

356
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,187
- Hi! Is everything all right?
- One moment.

357
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,626
Yeah, fine!

358
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,433
- Hi...
- Thora.

359
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,595
- Yes, Thora...
- Don't you remember me?

360
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:04,441
- Yeah sure... from...
- From your class.

361
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,943
- What are you doing here?
- Coming to your rescue.

362
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:08,871
Just kidding.

363
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,780
- We've got everything.
- OK. Dad's picking us up.

364
00:34:18,022 --> 00:34:21,651
- Are you in a band?
- Not really, I'm a groupie.

365
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:26,228
They're playing
at the guesthouse tonight.

366
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:29,866
- You should come, they're really good.
- Yeah.

367
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,268
Darling!

368
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:38,569
Do you know each other?

369
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:40,440
He was my teacher
at the University.

370
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,911
This lad is the best thing
that has landed on this island.

371
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:45,313
Lad! How cute.

372
00:34:46,684 --> 00:34:49,209
He's opening a golf course.

373
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,687
And he has promised us
a lot of golfers this summer.

374
00:34:51,722 --> 00:34:55,624
- A golf course? No kidding!
- Actually, it's not a joke.

375
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:59,528
- Jon, help me out here.
- We want money now or we go.

376
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:09,163
Guys, please, one more day.

377
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:11,175
I will pay you tomorrow.

378
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:13,775
Come on!

379
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:22,881
Thanks a million, Jon.
You didn't say a word!

380
00:35:24,388 --> 00:35:26,982
Is this the guided tour of Flatey?

381
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,321
Yes.

382
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,424
Welcome to Flatey!

383
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,528
Almost the northest island
people are living on... in.

384
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:57,777
And here, as you can see,
we have the fish freezing plant

385
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:02,919
where 200 people were working,
when it was working!

386
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,396
And here on our right
we have Mr. Mill-Jon.

387
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:21,708
I just had a great idea.
A new piece, out of seaweed.

388
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:29,551
It comes from the sea, you know,
the uterus of the world.

389
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:36,757
Where all life comes from.
Mother, Mare, the sea, Maria.

390
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:39,661
Like my old pieces
but three dimensional.

391
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,962
I'll hang up a net
and let it hang, like an octopus,

392
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:49,132
or veins, new life.
Or a new planet...

393
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,534
Is that really necessary?

394
00:36:54,512 --> 00:36:55,706
What?

395
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,344
Never mind.

396
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:46,293
- Evening, Jon.
- Hi.

397
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:52,398
- Is Anna not coming?
- No, she wasn't feeling well.

398
00:37:53,471 --> 00:37:58,033
- She's out of this world.
- Who? What do you mean?

399
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:04,346
- Hildur, the girl on the saw.
- Right.

400
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,599
So you've stopped teaching?

401
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:31,806
I took a leave.

402
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,547
Because of your wife?

403
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,277
Yes...

404
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:47,483
You could say that.

405
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,654
Why did you move to Flatey?

406
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,664
My wife is from here.

407
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,667
We came to try something new.

408
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:14,310
A wonderful, Icelandic folksong...

409
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,047
You should be an opera singer!

410
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,816
I studied in Vienna.

411
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:22,315
- Really, then why are you here?
- To sing for you, my friend!

412
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:33,370
Here comes Dad's tourist show.

413
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,672
Yes?

414
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,335
I'm sorry for...

415
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:13,935
What?

416
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:16,538
Sorry I asked
about your wife back there.

417
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,548
That's all right.

418
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,415
I just feel like I know you...
from school.

419
00:40:24,054 --> 00:40:26,215
- Jon.
- Yes

420
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:31,617
Why don't you relax a little.
You're off duty.

421
00:40:33,397 --> 00:40:38,357
- Want one?
- Why not? Thanks.

422
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:46,100
- The sunset is beautiful.
- Yes.

423
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,212
I don't know what happened,
if anything at all.

424
00:40:54,251 --> 00:40:56,879
I was living a nightmare.

425
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:02,859
Same students year after year.
Same books, same authors.

426
00:41:03,694 --> 00:41:08,188
Same questions, same answers,
and, of course, the same jokes.

427
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,663
I was teaching people
to teach other people -

428
00:41:12,703 --> 00:41:15,433
after becoming the teachers
they never wanted to be.

429
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,168
Like yourself?

430
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,070
Yeah, like myself.

431
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:20,440
Bummer.

432
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:26,642
You've worked your ass off
for years with no real results...

433
00:41:26,684 --> 00:41:29,653
Exhausted, but nothing to show for it.

434
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:35,648
I thought I couldn't love anyone
the way I love you.

435
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:41,063
I thought I could only love myself
the way I love you.

436
00:41:41,098 --> 00:41:42,656
Where did you dig this up?

437
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,497
Did you write it to your wife?

438
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,500
I can't remember.

439
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,268
Prick! Don't you remember
whom you loved like yourself?

440
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,456
- Stop it.
- I'm freezing!

441
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,694
You'll wake up everyone.
Thora asked me...

442
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:12,628
I know Malla's window.

443
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,492
What?

444
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,025
Come down. We need your help.

445
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,627
You're just making fun of me.

446
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:21,695
I'm off to bed.

447
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:24,197
You know me better than that!

448
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,939
Why isn't he
wearing any clothes?

449
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,575
He fell in the sea.

450
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:32,605
Get him some clothes
before he freezes to death.

451
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:37,610
Out of the way.
What the hell is going on!

452
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:39,680
I told you to stay away from Malla!

453
00:42:40,257 --> 00:42:41,485
And Jon!

454
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:44,588
Is that the mother-in-law?

455
00:42:50,167 --> 00:42:53,762
You should be at home
thinking of a way to pay us back

456
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,864
instead of getting drunk
the night before your own wedding...

457
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,000
If there's going to be
a wedding at all!

458
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,541
Maybe you're being
a little rough on him, dear.

459
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:07,948
Are you going to make
your daughter homeless?

460
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:09,883
What do you mean?

461
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:12,722
He'll never pay us
once they are married.

462
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:15,691
Are you getting a lawyer
to go after your daughter?

463
00:43:17,561 --> 00:43:20,086
And have him auction their house?

464
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:25,900
We don't have to go that far.

465
00:43:27,371 --> 00:43:31,865
How could you lend money
to a man we hardly know?

466
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:38,737
Money? We simply leased
land we never use.

467
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:42,482
Let's be good, darling.

468
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:45,511
Now come here and cuddle
your big old polar bear.

469
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,152
Stop it!

470
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,838
What do we know about this man?

471
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,666
We don't even know
what happened to his wife.

472
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,619
- Hello.
- What got into you?

473
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,188
Sjonni.

474
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:25,161
I travel across
the country to see you

475
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:26,924
and then you ditch me?

476
00:44:26,964 --> 00:44:29,956
Don't you care
about anyone but yourself?

477
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,902
- I have to tell you something.
- What is it?

478
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,932
There is something wrong
with my heart.

479
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:39,033
It beats so irregularly.

480
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,703
Listen.

481
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:46,743
You're just too drunk.

482
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:51,314
Did you hear that?

483
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:57,921
I could drop dead any moment.

484
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,165
What would you do
if I had a heart attack?

485
00:45:07,604 --> 00:45:10,095
What's wrong with the connection
on this godforsaken island!

486
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:12,872
Just go to the phonespot
and try again.

487
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,004
Sorry, lost the connection.

488
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:52,679
I'm telling you because
you're my only friend.

489
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,484
You've told me this a hundred times -
and everyone else too.

490
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,851
Of course you have
a heart condition.

491
00:45:57,888 --> 00:46:01,085
You're an obese, alcoholic pothead.

492
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:02,649
Now get some sleep.

493
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:06,060
We'll get you a doctor tomorrow.

494
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,295
Bloody hell!

495
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,428
Where are you going?

496
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,771
I have to run down
to the guesthouse.

497
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,037
I'll come along.

498
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,510
Just take it easy.
I'll be right back.

499
00:46:55,546 --> 00:46:57,514
I can walk down
to the guesthouse.

500
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:03,447
All right then, go. Have fun.

501
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:08,389
I am going to get an extension
on the rent for the golf course.

502
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:09,449
Not to have fun.

503
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,062
You don't have to justify yourself.
Who's stopping you?

504
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:17,361
Don't be silly, Anna.
I'll be right back.

505
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:20,268
- Darling, please.
- Please what, my love?

506
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:23,300
- Don't go.
- Anna...

507
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,902
Stay home.
Let's talk, like we used to.

508
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:32,838
We can cook something.
You can read me your poems.

509
00:47:32,883 --> 00:47:34,373
Please don't go.

510
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:36,511
- Anna...
- Are you ashamed of me?

511
00:47:36,553 --> 00:47:37,918
No, that's not it.

512
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:46,123
I'm sorry.

513
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,563
When I feel like I'm feeling now
it's like I'm suffocating.

514
00:47:54,605 --> 00:47:57,199
I have to go out
to catch my breath.

515
00:47:58,008 --> 00:47:59,134
Let's try.

516
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:04,737
I'll play the piano.

517
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:06,942
- We can roll naked in the dew.
- Anna.

518
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:11,613
I'm sorry.

519
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,724
I have to go.

520
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,631
Then go.

521
00:48:35,612 --> 00:48:36,943
I won't be long.

522
00:48:40,217 --> 00:48:41,844
I'll be back before one.

523
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,255
Don't forget
to take your medication.

524
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,010
Jon!

525
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:12,846
Can I have a quick word?

526
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,918
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

527
00:49:22,326 --> 00:49:29,425
It's been a pleasure
to get to know you and your wife.

528
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,956
Thanks, likewise.

529
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:34,260
Naturally you've been busy,

530
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,637
and all couples
have their differences.

531
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:40,370
Did Anna say that?

532
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,308
I don't know how to put this, but...

533
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,785
your support is very important...

534
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,450
to her... now...

535
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:57,119
for her.

536
00:50:02,632 --> 00:50:04,657
I think you're absolutely right.

537
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,249
- It's a classic joke...
- No...

538
00:51:55,312 --> 00:51:56,939
What the... Anna!

539
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:11,391
What's going on?

540
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:23,864
My God.

541
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:25,670
- You know what!
- What?

542
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,674
It's Midsummer night!

543
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:33,483
Anna, don't do this.
Not now.

544
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,543
It's bright all night and nature
is bursting with power.

545
00:52:36,586 --> 00:52:41,148
We have to go out, roll naked
in the dew and... fuck.

546
00:52:42,192 --> 00:52:44,023
Let's go.
Let's go out and fuck.

547
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,724
Come on.
You're not dead yet.

548
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:54,334
If you don't come,
you're a faggot.

549
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,804
Stop it.

550
00:52:57,741 --> 00:52:58,708
Faggot!

551
00:53:01,878 --> 00:53:03,675
Catch me if you can!

552
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,410
Listen to the terns.
They are mocking you!

553
00:53:09,452 --> 00:53:11,181
Anna, keep quiet.

554
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:13,917
I'm going down to the village...

555
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,117
I'm coming!

556
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,789
...to tell everyone

557
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,794
you're too lazy
to fuck your wife!

558
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,335
Let's go inside.

559
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:46,516
I'm so pathetic.
I'm so ugly and disgusting...

560
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:49,491
You won't even...

561
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:33,564
Where's all the furniture?

562
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:36,063
What?

563
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,144
What the hell is this!

564
00:54:48,184 --> 00:54:50,015
When are you paying me?

565
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:55,091
Paying you?
What the hell are you talking about?

566
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,149
Stop it!

567
00:54:56,192 --> 00:55:00,219
I've been working for you more than
a year now, without getting paid.

568
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:01,662
Working for me?

569
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,630
This stupid golf course
was your idea!

570
00:55:05,669 --> 00:55:09,605
Exactly! So how about
paying me for the design?

571
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,007
Are you out of your mind?

572
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:18,175
Come outside, we'll settle this
once and for all.

573
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:27,319
- What's gotten into your head?
- Wait, I forgive you.

574
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:32,590
- Forgive what?
- Everything and I love you.

575
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:36,622
You can just keep the golf course.
It's my gift to you.

576
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:46,134
I'm getting married
in a couple of hours.

577
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,336
Exactly.

578
00:55:47,377 --> 00:55:51,245
That's why we decided
to take you out for dinner.

579
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,740
- You idiots.
- I love you too.

580
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,394
And now we invite you
to experience, only in Flatey,

581
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,624
the latest in adventure tourism.

582
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:12,123
Midnight arctic sun
golfball shooting!

583
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:38,717
Have a seat, Lalli boy.
Perfect timing!

584
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:41,254
Bringing the proper
12-year-old whiskey.

585
00:56:41,297 --> 00:56:43,561
It's the only thing
you didn't take.

586
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:48,699
The only thing you left.

587
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,136
Did you guys empty the guesthouse?

588
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,609
A proper toast...

589
00:56:58,214 --> 00:57:01,775
To the architect who designed
this wonderful restaurant.

590
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,950
Cheers!

591
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,012
To the dear old chap.

592
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:23,963
Then on my second year
at the university,

593
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,494
I was... completely bald.

594
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,275
Autoimmune disease, they call it.

595
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:35,671
Autoimmune?

596
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:39,113
Yes. I'm allergic to myself,
or my own hair.

597
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:41,548
The immune system rejects it.

598
00:58:42,952 --> 00:58:46,115
Of course I got to hear
all the jokes.

599
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:49,955
He's so boring,
he's even allergic to himself.

600
00:58:49,993 --> 00:58:57,024
But at least I've never
had a bad hair day...

601
00:59:06,643 --> 00:59:10,977
Maybe Jon is allergic to me.

602
00:59:13,316 --> 00:59:15,750
He used to dream of
changing the world with words.

603
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:20,017
He had an opinion on everything.
Now he never says a word...

604
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,785
unless I make him.

605
00:59:21,824 --> 00:59:24,793
And then he says
he doesn't love me anymore.

606
00:59:27,330 --> 00:59:30,299
At least not in the evenings.

607
00:59:31,834 --> 00:59:33,324
How sick is she?

608
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:37,834
It's hard to say.

609
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,006
Nothing ever heals.

610
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:50,609
She gets slightly better,
then it's back to the way it was.

611
00:59:55,792 --> 00:59:57,225
Well...

612
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,125
Are you sure
you've gone far enough?

613
00:59:59,562 --> 01:00:01,029
What do you mean?

614
01:00:01,864 --> 01:00:03,855
When you decided
to change your life.

615
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:08,737
You don't fix a marriage
by moving to a new place.

616
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:13,206
What if he stops loving me
in the daytime too?

617
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,012
What if he
stops loving me at all?

618
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:22,983
All I want is to be happy
with the man I love.

619
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,917
That's all I ask for.

620
01:00:29,125 --> 01:00:31,855
Maybe you should have
started all over again.

621
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,331
I don't get you.

622
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:42,633
No, but I get you!

623
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,470
What?

624
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:53,539
The terns.

625
01:01:45,101 --> 01:01:48,127
One is obsessed with money.
The other one can't stand it...

626
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:51,403
And I'm caught between them.

627
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:57,776
I've tried to explain this to your wife...

628
01:02:05,922 --> 01:02:10,291
- I have a favor to ask.
- What is it?

629
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:27,341
Take this...
Sisi doesn't know anything about it.

630
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,436
I've been putting
a little aside for years.

631
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,075
It's enough for what you owe us.

632
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:44,489
Are you lending me money
to pay you back?

633
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:48,896
Take it.
It's mine and I'm giving it to you.

634
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:52,264
Go down to the guesthouse,

635
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:56,567
shove it down her throat
and tell that fat bitch

636
01:02:56,606 --> 01:03:00,064
to choke on it.

637
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:07,543
Please, do me this favor.
I'm begging you.

638
01:03:11,387 --> 01:03:12,911
I can't.

639
01:03:12,955 --> 01:03:15,253
Nonsense. Of course you can.

640
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:21,759
What's wrong with me?

641
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:29,263
There is nothing wrong with you.
You're a little drunk, like me...

642
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:31,671
but other than that, you're fine.

643
01:03:31,707 --> 01:03:37,703
I was going... to change my life.

644
01:03:39,215 --> 01:03:41,012
But I...

645
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:51,152
It wasn't supposed to go this way.

646
01:03:55,965 --> 01:04:01,460
You know something?
My dream was to become an opera singer.

647
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,669
Yes.

648
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:16,242
Maybe things didn't turn out
the way we dreamt.

649
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,113
I guess not.

650
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,188
But let me tell you something.

651
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:28,222
You have changed your life
and I am an opera singer.

652
01:04:30,566 --> 01:04:32,261
To hell with all of them.

653
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,562
- Lalli.
- Yes?

654
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:38,236
Can you do me a favor in return?

655
01:04:38,274 --> 01:04:40,435
Anything, my friend.

656
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,407
Give this to your wife.

657
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,673
You're going to
the guesthouse anyway.

658
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:47,376
Yes.

659
01:04:49,585 --> 01:04:55,080
Then give this to her and tell her
I'm sorry for paying late.

660
01:04:55,124 --> 01:04:56,148
OK.

661
01:05:00,296 --> 01:05:03,129
No. I can't do that.

662
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,360
She'll know right away
that it's coming from me.

663
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,301
You'll have to do this yourself.

664
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:24,851
Aren't churches supposed
to be open at all times?

665
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:28,579
What if you have an urge to pray
in the middle of the night?

666
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:34,318
And what if the bloody organist
has to practice the wedding march?

667
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:51,636
That's it.

668
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:57,218
Who the hell...

669
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,420
Crap!

670
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:02,854
Who made these arrangements?

671
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,558
Walk down the aisle
like you just got married -

672
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,329
to find the rhythm.

673
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:14,233
No problem.

674
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,969
Malla, will you marry me?

675
01:06:23,012 --> 01:06:23,910
Yes.

676
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,364
What the hell is going on!

677
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:48,935
He had to try out the organ.

678
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:50,804
At four o'clock in the morning?

679
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:55,542
I think the organ needs tuning.

680
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:57,773
Out! Get out!

681
01:06:57,813 --> 01:07:00,611
How about joining us
in the hot tub, Reverend?

682
01:07:00,649 --> 01:07:01,707
Out!

683
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:49,223
A new beginning, a new life...

684
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:55,696
but still the same old fool.

685
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,112
Whats going on here?

686
01:09:06,509 --> 01:09:08,500
Anna said you wanted to talk to me.

687
01:09:10,012 --> 01:09:11,138
Yes...

688
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:15,782
Your wife is sick, she needs you.

689
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:18,844
If you love her
you can't go on like this.

690
01:09:18,888 --> 01:09:20,685
This isn't that simple.

691
01:09:20,723 --> 01:09:24,659
How convenient.
Nothing in this world is good or bad.

692
01:09:24,693 --> 01:09:27,924
No right or wrong,
just complex and difficult.

693
01:09:27,963 --> 01:09:31,626
What do you want from me?
Why are you obsessed with us?

694
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,464
- Don't make this about me.
- Jon!

695
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:39,766
Well, then!

696
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:41,639
And I will not accept this
in the graveyard.

697
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,474
What the hell are you
talking about?

698
01:09:58,694 --> 01:10:00,821
I'm sorry, but I haven't seen you
since... you know.

699
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,024
I can't do this.
The guilt is killing me.

700
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:04,123
Why do you feel guilty?

701
01:10:04,166 --> 01:10:05,133
What?

702
01:10:05,167 --> 01:10:06,225
What did you do?

703
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:08,327
What do you mean?
You know what we did.

704
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,201
We were saving a man's life.

705
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,799
What on earth
are your talking about?

706
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:14,866
You said it yourself.
It's acceptable to cheat on your wife,

707
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,775
if it is to save a man's life.

708
01:10:16,812 --> 01:10:18,541
I am beginning to understand.

709
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:21,247
You're a pathetic man, Jon.

710
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,341
Stop it.

711
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:25,978
You lied to me when you said
you loved me and I believed you.

712
01:10:26,789 --> 01:10:30,350
You can start over.
Make your dreams come true.

713
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,251
To write, to dream again.

714
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,627
I don't even remember
my dreams.

715
01:10:36,665 --> 01:10:38,257
You didn't dream about
running a golf course.

716
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:43,996
We came here to get better
and then you lie to me.

717
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:48,939
I may be ill, but you're sick.

718
01:10:49,345 --> 01:10:51,813
I don't want to see you
end up like Dad.

719
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:54,907
Having lost his dreams and
stuck with a woman he never loved -

720
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,781
because he didn't have
the guts to leave.

721
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,884
What did she want?

722
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,261
I want to know.
What did she say?

723
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:08,863
Don't ask, please.

724
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,165
Tell me, what did she want?

725
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:33,251
I heard it.

726
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:39,994
The terns told me.
I heard them.

727
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:41,953
He's lying.

728
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:43,761
He's lying.

729
01:11:45,934 --> 01:11:47,162
Come and see.

730
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:55,943
I'm gone. I can't do this.

731
01:11:59,815 --> 01:12:01,180
He's lying!

732
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,974
Stop it.

733
01:12:04,119 --> 01:12:06,314
He's lying!

734
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,150
Shut up!

735
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,221
You fucking lunatic!

736
01:12:27,242 --> 01:12:28,106
Sorry.

737
01:12:29,778 --> 01:12:30,745
I'm leaving.

738
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:32,871
I'm gone.

739
01:12:59,942 --> 01:13:01,967
My God,
how I despise the man!

740
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:06,540
Why do you do this to me?

741
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:14,179
How am I supposed to bless
a marriage I don't believe in?

742
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,418
Forgive me. Forgive me.

743
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:26,494
That's it.

744
01:13:57,132 --> 01:13:59,327
Thank you.

745
01:14:27,663 --> 01:14:28,823
Sorry.

746
01:14:30,132 --> 01:14:31,497
I've lost my shoe.

747
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:37,403
Fuck, how am I going to play
with only one shoe on?

748
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,135
Shit!
The wedding.

749
01:14:58,794 --> 01:15:03,959
I have to pick up guests from the ferry.

750
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,193
Oh?

751
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:06,599
Get going!

752
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:10,196
When are we getting married?

753
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:14,231
What? We?

754
01:15:14,643 --> 01:15:16,543
That's what you said yesterday.

755
01:15:16,912 --> 01:15:18,243
No, I didn't.

756
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,907
Yes, you did.
In the church.

757
01:15:30,025 --> 01:15:33,324
Jon, you've got to wake up.
I've lost my shoe.

758
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,461
I passed out...

759
01:15:43,505 --> 01:15:44,767
But now you're born again.

760
01:15:44,806 --> 01:15:46,740
It's a new day, a new life...

761
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:50,336
and you're getting a new wife.
Not a bad day!

762
01:15:54,349 --> 01:15:56,010
I can't do this.

763
01:15:56,051 --> 01:15:57,814
I want my old life back.

764
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:04,459
As you can see there is sea
all around this island.

765
01:16:05,694 --> 01:16:09,357
The man is a proper priest, I hope.

766
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:11,229
It looks like he is.

767
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,498
She's not moving in
with Anna's old furniture.

768
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:21,999
Good for her.

769
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:25,540
- Thora. Darling.
- Yes?

770
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:30,382
- Maybe I've been a bit unfair.
- Mom!

771
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,822
Your father promised you
a new kitchen as a wedding gift.

772
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:36,585
I was thinking...

773
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:38,820
if we don't give you
the new kitchen,

774
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:43,422
but subtract it from Jon's debt,
and give you instead...

775
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:44,796
a refrigerator.

776
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,298
Why are you doing this?

777
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:52,706
Because I'm trying
to find a compromise.

778
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:54,773
We don't need any gifts.

779
01:16:54,810 --> 01:16:56,778
Jon's old refrigerator
works just fine.

780
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,379
Of course we have
to give you something.

781
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:07,286
We give you the feast
and the refrigerator.

782
01:17:07,322 --> 01:17:10,814
You are obsessed with money.
I didn't ask for any presents...

783
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:13,851
and we can just skip the feast
if it's such a big deal.

784
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,295
Wouldn't that be just perfect!

785
01:17:17,332 --> 01:17:19,994
I've been preparing
this feast for weeks.

786
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,627
I made twenty kilos
of rhubarb jam.

787
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,934
I don't give a damn!

788
01:17:23,972 --> 01:17:26,202
You don't care about
anything but yourself!

789
01:17:26,241 --> 01:17:30,974
I'm not getting married
to eat your fucking jam!

790
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,704
How do I pee
in this fucking thing!

791
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,114
But why is he marrying you?

792
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,515
Because he loves me!

793
01:17:40,956 --> 01:17:42,423
Coffee, we need coffee.

794
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:46,654
Where do you keep the coffee?

795
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:48,562
What am I doing?

796
01:17:49,197 --> 01:17:50,721
What do you mean?

797
01:17:50,766 --> 01:17:52,131
This wedding.

798
01:17:52,734 --> 01:17:57,034
She's almost 20 years younger.
It will never work.

799
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,107
Why are you asking me?

800
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:02,702
The only woman
I have lived with is my mother.

801
01:18:03,545 --> 01:18:05,103
I can't do it...

802
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:12,553
Do you realize how lucky you are
to have someone who loves you?

803
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:23,131
Dear old chap...

804
01:18:24,866 --> 01:18:28,199
I don't care if your wife
is 18 or 80...

805
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:33,936
if only you promise to be happy
and stop this bloody moaning.

806
01:18:36,044 --> 01:18:38,376
Who the hell
invented the cufflink!

807
01:18:39,848 --> 01:18:42,180
What about
all the money he owes us?

808
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:46,586
Maybe he's doing this
to get out of the debt?

809
01:18:46,621 --> 01:18:48,646
What do you have
in common after all?

810
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:52,952
Are you marrying him
just to get back at me?

811
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,291
Can I pee in private?

812
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:00,993
I give up. I can't do this anymore.

813
01:19:02,003 --> 01:19:04,267
You and your father
bully me around.

814
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:05,398
Close the door.

815
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,771
You're so pushy!

816
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:09,110
Jesus!
I'm having a heart attack.

817
01:19:09,144 --> 01:19:11,942
Do that somewhere else,
so I can pee.

818
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:18,110
- So you're all right with the refrigerator?
- Mom!

819
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,722
Coming!

820
01:19:32,467 --> 01:19:34,435
- What's your shoe size?
- What?

821
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:40,807
- Malla.
- No.

822
01:19:52,954 --> 01:19:54,251
Where have you been?

823
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:57,216
Around.

824
01:19:58,994 --> 01:20:01,986
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from Borkur?

825
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:04,225
- Why?
- What do you mean why?

826
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:06,427
Why can't I be with Borkur?

827
01:20:06,468 --> 01:20:08,459
It's not good for you.

828
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:12,206
- Is it because I'm different?
- Malla, darling...

829
01:20:13,241 --> 01:20:14,799
Is it dangerous?

830
01:20:15,777 --> 01:20:18,439
And why can't Thora be with Jon?
Is that also dangerous?

831
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,744
It's better for people
to be with their own kind.

832
01:20:23,118 --> 01:20:25,245
So why can't Lalli be with you?

833
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,389
Is it because he is always
kind and you are...

834
01:20:30,358 --> 01:20:31,757
And I am what?

835
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,336
Yes, thank you.

836
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:44,300
Did they have my size?

837
01:20:44,339 --> 01:20:47,240
- Yes, they found a pair of shoes.
- Brilliant!

838
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:49,038
They'll be on the ferry...

839
01:20:49,077 --> 01:20:54,242
and should arrive
just in time for the ceremony.

840
01:20:54,282 --> 01:20:55,476
Great, I love you!

841
01:20:56,751 --> 01:20:58,116
Thanks for the help.

842
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:07,125
- Isn't that Sjonni?
- It looks like him.

843
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:11,658
Let's go to the church.

844
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,091
I'm Kristin,
the mother of the groom.

845
01:21:38,126 --> 01:21:39,787
Hi, I'm Sisi.

846
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:44,962
Oh, my God.

847
01:21:45,634 --> 01:21:48,102
- Where is he?
- He'll be here.

848
01:22:30,512 --> 01:22:34,039
What is she doing on that boat?
Where is she going?

849
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:41,152
Oh, my God.

850
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:59,201
We have to get some help.
Hurry!

851
01:23:21,763 --> 01:23:23,060
All right, darling?

852
01:23:41,349 --> 01:23:44,113
The guests are here and
the ceremony is about to start.

853
01:23:44,152 --> 01:23:46,677
Everyone is waiting for you.
Pull yourself together.

854
01:23:53,661 --> 01:23:54,821
No...

855
01:23:56,865 --> 01:23:59,493
What's happening?
Damn!

856
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:05,539
You have to run!

857
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,207
Don't go! Hey!

858
01:24:10,812 --> 01:24:13,076
Ferry! Don't go!

859
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:32,791
This has to be a joke.

860
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,421
- She's so young.
- I know.

861
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:13,233
Do something, Daddy.

862
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:13,901
I can't do this to you.
Let's step outside.

863
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,577
What the hell are you doing?

864
01:26:32,620 --> 01:26:34,850
- I can't marry you.
- What?

865
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,584
Get right back in there.

866
01:26:36,891 --> 01:26:40,850
Can't this wait
until after the wedding?

867
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:41,919
Shut up!

868
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,195
I have no right
to ruin your life too.

869
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:48,161
Since we met
you've aged ten years.

870
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,568
You don't laugh anymore.

871
01:26:50,271 --> 01:26:52,000
Dear guests, just sit still.

872
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,008
The happy couple
has something to discuss.

873
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,600
We are in no hurry.

874
01:26:55,643 --> 01:26:57,235
Nobody is going anywhere.

875
01:26:57,278 --> 01:26:59,838
There isn't another ferry
until tomorrow.

876
01:27:00,915 --> 01:27:02,678
- I've infected you.
- With what?

877
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:08,246
With boredom, self pity,
anxiety, obsession...

878
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,281
I'm burnt out, a wreck!

879
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,691
Stop it!

880
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,128
A complete burnout!

881
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:18,291
Maybe we could get some music.

882
01:27:24,372 --> 01:27:29,105
My conscience is bad enough
without ruining your life too.

883
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:37,917
He's got the gray hair blues,
He's got the gray hair blues

884
01:27:42,557 --> 01:27:44,320
- Don't step on...
- Sorry.

885
01:27:47,328 --> 01:27:48,795
I killed Anna.

886
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:55,226
I thought that by marrying you...

887
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:57,397
I could justify what I did to her.

888
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:03,733
That I did it in the name of love.
For a reason.

889
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,177
- But I'm just not a good man.
- Yes you are.

890
01:28:22,196 --> 01:28:24,289
What's going on?
Everyone is waiting.

891
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:27,199
- He wants to cancel the wedding.
- What?

892
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,770
You can't do this to us.
Not now.

893
01:28:36,077 --> 01:28:38,978
Do I have to drag you to the altar?

894
01:28:39,013 --> 01:28:41,982
I've said all there is to say.
There won't be any marriage.

895
01:28:42,016 --> 01:28:43,313
Mom, do something!

896
01:28:43,351 --> 01:28:45,785
You can't treat my girl this way.

897
01:28:46,254 --> 01:28:48,381
People are here for a wedding.

898
01:28:48,423 --> 01:28:49,856
If it's because of the money...

899
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,188
What money?

900
01:28:51,225 --> 01:28:53,318
It's not about money,
it's a question of conscience.

901
01:28:53,361 --> 01:28:55,488
What money are you talking about?

902
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:57,964
The money I gave him
so he could pay you.

903
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:00,524
- What money did you give him?
- Mom!

904
01:29:00,568 --> 01:29:01,967
What is going on?

905
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,130
He's not doing it. What money?

906
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:08,131
That's out of the question.
The church is reserved for a wedding

907
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,803
and by God there will be
a wedding in this church today.

908
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:13,177
Maybe he's hyper-anxious.
He got this as a child.

909
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:14,841
Answer me!

910
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:17,112
It's none of your
bloody business, woman!

911
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:21,986
That's it, this man is
a no-good, irresponsible bastard.

912
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,048
Now you've gone too far.

913
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,890
You don't say this to a man
who's about not to get married.

914
01:29:28,963 --> 01:29:30,931
Don't touch me,
you filthy bastard.

915
01:31:08,663 --> 01:31:09,857
Let me go.

916
01:31:09,897 --> 01:31:11,159
Never.

917
01:31:15,303 --> 01:31:20,263
If it's the last thing I do, I'm going
to get you back on your feet.

918
01:31:21,742 --> 01:31:23,175
Have you settled this?

919
01:31:23,644 --> 01:31:27,011
Bring the bloody priest!
We're doing this here!

920
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:54,399
I ask you bridegroom,
do you take Thora...

921
01:31:54,442 --> 01:31:58,378
to be your lawful,
wedded wife?

922
01:32:02,016 --> 01:32:03,108
Yes.

923
01:32:04,452 --> 01:32:09,549
- I ask you bride, do you take...
- Yes!

924
01:32:22,403 --> 01:32:24,894
But he shoots himself
at the end of the play.

925
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:29,171
Does it mean that the love affair
he had wasn't justifiable?

926
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:31,906
Of course love in itself
is always justifiable.

927
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:34,506
But it does not justify
our wrongdoings.

928
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:38,243
So what's the author's point then?

929
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:40,720
That life offers no simple answers -

930
01:32:40,755 --> 01:32:42,416
just complex questions.

931
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:49,657
The purpose of life isn't death,
even if it's the end result.

932
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:59,530
Just as love or happiness isn't
the purpose of life, as such.

933
01:33:00,975 --> 01:33:04,706
Rather the quest.
The quest for love, the quest for happiness.

934
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:09,106
Hi, darling.

935
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,953
Sorry I'm late. I got held up.

936
01:33:18,893 --> 01:33:20,451
Have you eaten already?

937
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,697
Are you coming along tonight?

938
01:33:35,009 --> 01:33:36,704
Do you feel like going?

939
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,109
I think you should go.

940
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:49,386
I'm going to stay in and write.

941
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:57,394
Constant love and happiness
is simply Utopia.

942
01:33:57,431 --> 01:34:01,060
It's much rather something
to be constantly pursued.

943
01:34:02,436 --> 01:34:07,533
If you are completely happy
for more than ten minutes...

944
01:34:07,575 --> 01:34:09,805
you must be an idiot.
