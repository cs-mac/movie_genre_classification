1
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,523
Phaedra!

2
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,070
Stravos!

3
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,720
Thank you, Thanos, here's to number 60.

4
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:37,827
Drink to 61, she's
already in construction.

5
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,893
Thank you.

6
00:03:42,089 --> 00:03:43,126
Thank you.

7
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:44,323
Thank you.

8
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,595
Thank you.

9
00:03:49,029 --> 00:03:50,037
<i>Dime'.!</i>

10
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,603
Everyone says she's a beauty.

11
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,040
Here's your present.

12
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,044
I be! It's a cigarette case.

13
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,237
How did you know?

14
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:00,544
A! Every baptism of a ship I design,

15
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,586
he gives me the same present,
a gold cigarette case.

16
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,415
That's not to break my luck.

17
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,612
Don't you like them?

18
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,920
I love them, but I keep
telling you I don't smoke.

19
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,262
Congratulations.

20
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:24,465
Thank you, Ariadne.

21
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:25,717
Uncle, is my present beautiful?

22
00:04:25,732 --> 00:04:27,111
For you, only beautiful presents.

23
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,811
No, no, this one is for your mother.

24
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:30,410
Ariadne.

25
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:31,709
Thank you.

26
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:32,774
Here's yours, Ercy.

27
00:04:32,806 --> 00:04:33,926
Mommy, may I open it now'?

28
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:35,015
Yes.

29
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,108
Andreas.

30
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:40,886
Thank you and congratulations, but, uh,

31
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,287
aren't you going too fast'?

32
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,553
Not fast enough.

33
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,870
I want to catch up with you.

34
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,588
Ah?

35
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:46,763
Then between the two of us,

36
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,960
we could destroy any monster
of the sea and elsewhere.

37
00:04:49,156 --> 00:04:50,567
Are you proposing a merger?

38
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:52,100
I'm proposing a merger.

39
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,828
Well, suppose you catch up first.

40
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,164
Uncle Thanos!

41
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,439
Put it on me.

42
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,474
When I baptize my next ship,

43
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,408
maybe I'll name it after you.

44
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,673
Would you like that, hmm?

45
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:05,905
SS Ercy.

46
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,509
Mommy, did you hear?

47
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08,412
. Hey!

48
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:11,418
Come on, they want a picture
of the old sea monster

49
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:12,851
and his sons-in-law.

50
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,752
Did you give Grandpa his present'?

51
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,958
The first one.

52
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:20,525
Come on, come on, it's time.

53
00:05:20,787 --> 00:05:21,787
Come on.

54
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,832
Just a minute.

55
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,500
Phaedra.

56
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:34,934
Phaedra,

57
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,677
your present.

58
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,386
It's perfect.

59
00:05:44,611 --> 00:05:45,611
Anna.

60
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,349
LOOK.

61
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:52,956
Open your bag.

62
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:55,693
Take these.

63
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,409
1 <i>3333 rial I;'; Ilfl 'ii</i>

64
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,007
1 <i>3333 rial I;'; Ilfl 'ii</i>

65
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,310
I have the most beautiful
daughters in all of Athens

66
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,488
and my sons-in-law are the most powerful.

67
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:19,247
And you the strongest of us all.

68
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,479
Of course.

69
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,067
I christen this ship Phaedra.

70
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:46,042
May God bless her and all
those who sail with her.

71

1 <i>3333 rial I;'; Ilfl 'ii.</i>

72
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,153
Ercy, you look pretty tonight.

73
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,385
Thank you.

74
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:44,302
They are powerful.

75
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:46,238
They speak many languages

76
00:07:46,433 --> 00:07:48,777
and they celebrate with fire in the sky.

77
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,485
Oh, no, it is I who open the dance.

78
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,959
1 <i>3333 rial I;'; Ilfl 'ii.</i>

79
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,870
Pardon.

80
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:01,008
Andreas, business during my party'?

81
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,311
Just a minute.

82
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:05,649
I'm sending someone a birthday telegram.

83
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:07,984
Ah, a birthday telegram.

84
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:10,024
Yes.

85
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,719
What time is it now in Brussels?

86
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,023
In Brussels?

87
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:17,093
Only an hour earlier than here.

88
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,825
Yes, of course.

89
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:21,699
Well, say happy birthday from me, too.

90
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,537
It's a lovely party, Mr. Karillis.

91
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,169
Thank you, your Highness.

92
00:09:29,369 --> 00:09:31,371
If you decide to stay
in Greece for a while,

93
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,517
we'll have reason for another party.

94
00:09:41,848 --> 00:09:42,918
Let's dance.

95
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,692
It's your night, Phaedra.

96
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,422
You look beautiful.

97
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,237
Mother is more jealous of you than ever.

98
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,564
. EFCY-

99
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,263
- Really, Phaedra, I know everything.

100
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:57,271
About what?

101
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,967
About how Uncle Thanos
was crazy about Mommy first,

102
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,880
and he divorced the English woman for her,

103
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,612
and then you came back from Switzerland,

104
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:05,036
and he fell madly in love with you,

105
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,751
and the son of the English woman hates you

106
00:10:06,873 --> 00:10:07,908
instead of Mommy.

107
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,610
Will you dance with me, Ercy'?

108
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:11,413
You came just in time.

109
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,715
Take her away.

110
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:17,422
Phaedra, I'm going to do the same thing.

111
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,121
I'm going to lure all the
men away from their women.

112
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,438
That's Renee Felere.

113
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,740
He owns all those uranium mines.

114
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:59,502
Do you know any girl
who wants a uranium mine?

115
00:11:00,426 --> 00:11:02,633
They accepted, all of them.

116
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,536
The prince, too'?

117
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,107
They're all on my payroll.

118
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,937
The power you have over people,

119
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,045
it must be exciting to you.

120
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:12,375
From time to time.

121
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,211
And the power you have over men,

122
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,852
is it exciting to you'?

123
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:18,613
From time to time.

124
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,150
Come with me.

125
00:11:24,784 --> 00:11:27,628
She has everything she could want.

126
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,231
But so do you.

127
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,025
Of course.

128
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,865
Psst!

129
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,543
Listen, I'm going to disappear.

130
00:11:43,736 --> 00:11:44,339
What HOW?

131
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:46,882
Brussels, something big.

132
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:47,710
Tonight?

133
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:48,511
Now.

134
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,516
I'll be back for lunch tomorrow.

135
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,313
Make it on the yacht and invite Andreas.

136
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:53,320
I want to see the expression on his face.

137
00:11:53,513 --> 00:11:55,322
Will you never be satisfied?

138
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,515
No.

139
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,493
They're exploring (hose
other planets just for me.

140
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:32,551
I'm tired.

141
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:35,788
I'm worried.

142
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:38,766
Talk to me, Anna, talk to me.

143
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,939
All of Athens is at
your fee! And you're sad.

144
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,300
Anna.

145
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:45,202
What am I worried about?

146
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:46,741
Mr. Thanos?

147
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:48,378
I don't know.

148
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,409
It's Thanos!

149
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,247
How many helicopters does he own?

150
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,152
Even he doesn't know.

151
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,735
I said happy birthday in person.

152
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:20,932
Bravo.

153
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,238
Bravo, bravo.

154
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,777
You're beautiful, I love you!

155
00:13:26,973 --> 00:13:28,975
Come on up,
we've already finished.

156
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,775
I'm not hungry, just throw me a grape.

157
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,151
I could take you to court.

158
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,619
The Belgians and I had a deal.

159
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,587
Did they sign?

160
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,781
We shook hands.

161
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,317
Maybe it was to say goodbye.

162
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,087
We shook hands on a deal.

163
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:41,322
We shook hands on a deal, too,

164
00:13:41,521 --> 00:13:42,625
but after they signed.

165
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:43,425
Bravo.

166
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,261
You told me to catch up, didn't you?

167
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,438
Yes, bu! Not so fast!

168
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,129
Thanos, you're a pirate.

169
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,673
One day you'll be hung
by your own ambition.

170
00:13:51,864 --> 00:13:54,276
I'm ambitious, my queen, only for you.

171
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:58,108
Why do men dedicate all
their crimes to women?

172
00:13:58,304 --> 00:13:59,612
I can't anymore.

173
00:13:59,806 --> 00:14:02,184
Congratulations, Phaedra,
your new cook is a wonder.

174
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:06,380
You steal her and there will
really be war in the family.

175
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,296
Come on up.
Thanos, but I've forgotten

176
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,527
to congratulate for your son, Alexis.

177
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,043
He didn't get married, did he'?

178
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:20,694
Didn't you see the Sunday Observer?

179
00:14:20,893 --> 00:14:25,342
At an exhibition of young
painters he got very nice reviews.

180
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,910
That's worse than getting married.

181
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:30,239
But it can'! Be.

182
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,882
Alexis goes to the London
School of Economics.

183
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,983
We spent the weekend
in London 10 days ago.

184
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,211
He never said a word about painting.

185
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,221
I think they even
mentioned you, wait a minute.

186
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,316
Ercy, did you keep the
copy of the Observer?

187
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:43,034
It's in my cabin, but I remember it.

188
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:45,025
I was thrilled for you, Uncle Thanos.

189
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,178
It said, "if young Alexis
Karillis keeps working",

190
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,927
"he may well become lo painting"

191
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:51,761
"what is illustrious
father is to shipping."

192
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:52,662
Damn!

193
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,100
Tomorrow I'm going to London.

194
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,865
F' I

195
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:02,046
I've got to be in Rotterdam tomorrow.

196
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,238
Phaedra,

197
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,581
you'll go to London for me.

198
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:10,413
BM I...

199
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,720
You're going to Paris for your dresses,

200
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,417
you'll go by way of London.

201
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:15,388
Bring him to Paris, I'll meet you there.

202
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,254
But he's always refused to see me.

203
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,622
It's different now.

204
00:15:18,851 --> 00:15:21,559
His mother remarried and he's grown up.

205
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,358
He'll like you.

206
00:15:23,556 --> 00:15:26,799
Just get him away from London
and these young painters,

207
00:15:27,026 --> 00:15:28,737
then between us, we'll
persuade him to spend

208
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,001
the wonderful summer in Greece.

209
00:15:30,196 --> 00:15:32,972
You're very anxious to
have him here, aren't you?

210
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,304
I love my son, and you know it.

211
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,037
Of course,

212
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,978
but is that the only reason?

213
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:41,206
No,

214
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,448
it's not the only reason.

215
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:08,268
This time I buy every
dress in the collection.

216
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:11,506
Don't go, I had a bad dream.

217
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:12,977
Don't be ridiculous.

218
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,449
Don't pack that ring,
I wear it on the trip.

219
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:19,746
Anna, what's wrong?

220
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,086
Give it to me.

221
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:30,956
Anna.

222
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,334
I don't want you to go.

223
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:41,273
In my dream, two boys
were fighting with spears.

224
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:42,775
One was your son,

225
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,874
the other the son of the foreigner.

226
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:53,151
Why do you want to frighten me'?

227
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,837
Protect his fortune, he's only a child.

228
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:13,844
Your husband will put the
son of the English woman

229
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,239
in the shipping.

230
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:17,004
He's building an empire.

231
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,204
He needs a prince.

232
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,351
And my father, he sees everything.

233
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,983
He sees in the dark.

234
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,387
Do you think he let everything go

235
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,687
to the son of the foreigner?

236
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,929
All my dowry went into those ships.

237
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:36,491
I'm afraid.

238
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,869
I'm afraid.

239
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,574
I have a message
for you Mrs. Karillis.

240
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,013
Mr. Karillis is detained.

241
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,881
He would like you to pick
him up at the British Museum.

242
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,921
He will wait for you in the entry room.

243
00:19:07,613 --> 00:19:08,648
Are you all right?

244
00:19:08,848 --> 00:19:10,418
Yes, I'm sorry, I.

245
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,026
You're Alexis.

246
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,257
<i>Mes,</i>

247
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,504
and you're Phaedra.

248
00:19:22,695 --> 00:19:23,867
Yes.

249
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:39,047
Never let them photograph you.

250
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,655
They'd make you look pretty,

251
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,655
and you're not pretty.

252
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,794
Your face is unique.

253
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:47,965
I never saw a face like yours.

254
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:49,861
Don't turn away.

255
00:19:50,056 --> 00:19:54,505
We're here to know each
other, Father's orders.

256
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,641
Do you always obey your father's orders?

257
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,707
They are sacred.

258
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:03,745
Well, he commands you to
like me and me to like you.

259
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,973
And do you always obey his orders?

260
00:20:07,173 --> 00:20:08,345
I write them.

261
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,148
Aphrodite, headless,

262
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,592
reclining on the lap of her mother.

263
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,818
Aphrodite.

264
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,865
I need some air.

265
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,363
Please, let's go.

266
00:20:24,557 --> 00:20:26,036
Come on.

267
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:29,734
I don't call you Mother, do I'?

268
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:32,170
If you do, <i>I'll</i> kill you.

269
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:40,343
You know,

270
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,610
in London one can walk
and talk at the same time.

271
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,412
What should we talk about?

272
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,610
Me.

273
00:20:47,046 --> 00:20:48,787
When did you being to paint?

274
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,015
A few years ago.

275
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:53,197
Does I! Mean a lot to you'?

276
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,591
I don't know yet.

277
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,596
And the London School of Economics?

278
00:20:56,789 --> 00:20:59,065
Ah, I'm mad for it, I'm
glad you brought it up.

279
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,498
Must drop in one of these days,

280
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,732
I haven't set foot there
the whole semester.

281
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,100
Good morning?

282
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,631
Good evening?

283
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,139
Good.

284
00:21:09,368 --> 00:21:10,813
Eyes?

285
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,708
Hands?

286
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,612
Uh,.

287
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:16,616
Bravo, and when I say

288
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,879
my body hurts,

289
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,250
that means in Greek my feet hurt.

290
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,646
I thought you liked walking.

291
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,660
Not in these shoes.

292
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:25,487
Well, come on, I'll buy you others.

293
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:27,459
Thank you.

294
00:21:28,554 --> 00:21:29,328
Thank you.

295
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,124
Goodbye.

296
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,096
Goodbye, sir.

297
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,769
Goodbye.

298
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,169
I look funny.

299
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,276
You look funny all right.

300
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,069
Sir,

301
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:48,474
don't stare at my mother.

302
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:55,649
I beg your pardon?

303
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:59,285
That means thank you in Greek.

304
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:00,828
Uh-huh, very welcome, sir.

305
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,020
Yes.

306
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,329
Didn't your father teach you any Greek?

307
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,166
No, Mother wouldn't let him.

308
00:22:11,363 --> 00:22:14,037
She thinks all Greeks are savages.

309
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,943
Where is your mother now?

310
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,945
In Hong Kong, her new husband's there.

311
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:20,640
He's with the diplomatic corps.

312
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:24,947
You must love her very much
to hate me as much as you did.

313
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:27,888
Well, you know how kids are,

314
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,184
intolerant little puritans.

315
00:22:31,317 --> 00:22:33,228
But now I know their marriage was wrong

316
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,695
and that you're the perfect
woman for my father.

317
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,335
Shall we talk about him now'?

318
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:40,526
We have serious things...

319
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,966
Later.

320
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,676
And you have lot of friends here?

321
00:22:54,874 --> 00:22:56,234
Oh, yes, hundreds, nice friends.

322
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,308
Girls?

323
00:22:58,711 --> 00:22:59,711
<i>. One,</i>

324
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:04,854
one beautiful, miraculous girl.

325
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:10,357
Well that may complicate things.

326
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:13,696
Your father doesn't know about her.

327
00:23:13,893 --> 00:23:15,065
You're gonna tell him.

328
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,672
. Me?

329
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:17,862
Yes.

330
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:20,233
You're gonna meet her right now.

331
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,432
It's impossible.

332
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,374
Why'?

333
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,514
Not in these flat shoes.

334
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,377
Oh, she won't notice
the shoes, I swear it.

335
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,779
Please-.

336
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,385
Come meet my girl.

337
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,026
Stop, there she is.

338
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,100
There's my girl.

339
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,142
Excuse me, please.

340
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,441
I haven't kissed her today.

341
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:39,454
Make my father give her to me.

342
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,124
Tell him I'll give up painting.

343
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,816
Tell him I'll give up breathing.

344
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:48,128
He's half Greek, very impulsive.

345
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:50,792
It's his girl.

346
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,420
Now, we talk seriously.

347
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,026
You are my prisoner,
I'm taking you to Paris.

348
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,567
Your father wants to talk
to you about your future.

349
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:01,430
You are young.

350
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:02,660
Yes, Mommy.

351
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,436
I hate giving advice.

352
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:06,664
I'm not your mother, I...

353
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:07,869
You're my stepmother,

354
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,240
as wicked and ugly as
a fairytale stepmother,

355
00:26:10,436 --> 00:26:12,780
and I adore you, and will
you tell him about the car?

356
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,450
You're a child.

357
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,175
Yes, Mommy.

358
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,376
Will you talk to him?

359
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,046
I will, and don't call me Mommy.

360
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,246
No, ma'am.

361
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,094
You like your father?

362
00:26:31,723 --> 00:26:32,895
Uh, he's mad,

363
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:37,908
but maybe he's a great man,
I like him when I see him.

364
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,099
He wants to see more of you-.

365
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,779
He wants you to come to Greece-.

366
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,749
Greece, to stay'?

367
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,740
Forever?

368
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,153
Your father stays in no place forever.

369
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:53,447
He's a meteor.

370
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,124
Why didn't he ask me before?

371
00:26:57,316 --> 00:26:58,316
Why now?

372
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:01,997
Probably because of me.

373
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:03,825
He knew you hated me.

374
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:07,461
Why are you helping him?

375
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,965
I was going to Paris
to buy some dresses.

376
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,940
He asked me to come by way of London

377
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,136
and give you the message.

378
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,007
I did.

379
00:27:18,237 --> 00:27:19,237
. Please,

380
00:27:20,405 --> 00:27:21,440
be forgiving.

381
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,112
I only hated you until I met you.

382
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,482
Now I'm crazy about you.

383
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,059
And now I'd like you to dance with me,

384
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:35,156
so that everyone will look
at me with dark jealousy.

385
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,668
Please?

386
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:08,224
I made up a poem for you.

387
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,625
Would you like to hear it?

388
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:11,391
Of course.

389
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:20,041
Do you like it?

390
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,368
Very much.

391
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,004
Very much.

392
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:40,728
Let's stay here for a few minutes.

393
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:41,752
All right.

394
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:44,030
Driver?

395
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,531
Yes, sir?

396
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,702
We're gonna stay
here for a few minutes.

397
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,672
Just go around once and then pick us up.

398
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,898
Very good, sir.

399
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:55,276
Please come to Greece-.

400
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,504
At least come to Paris
to talk to your father.

401
00:29:03,875 --> 00:29:06,685
I would like you to
want me to come to Greece,

402
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:10,416
because you would like
me to come to Greece.

403
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:15,898
I do, I wish it with all my heart.

404
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:19,557
LOOK.

405
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,707
In ancient Greece when they
wished something very hard,

406
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,933
they would make a sacrifice.

407
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:29,043
They used to carry a pig into the water

408
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,145
and offer it to the gods.

409
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,041
A <i>pig'?</i>

410
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:34,148
. A Pig,

411
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,977
but I have no pig.

412
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:38,779
Then sacrifice something else.

413
00:29:43,248 --> 00:29:45,057
I could sacrifice this ring.

414
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,593
You could not.

415
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,172
Hey!

416
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,002
Hey.

417
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:01,232
Touch it.

418
00:30:05,737 --> 00:30:06,737
Look at it.

419
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,678
It's beautiful, is it not'?

420
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,787
Yes, it's beautiful.

421
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:17,685
Now give it to me.

422
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,263
I wish that you come to Greece.

423
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:32,499
- Hey!
- You're crazy!

424
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:35,941
You're crazy!

425
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,478
7,000 pigs into the Thames!

426
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,344
Seven million pigs into the Thames!

427
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,951
For you.

428
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:44,141
For me.

429
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:49,886
Come on, you sluggard!

430
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:52,220
We're going to Paris!

431
00:31:14,172 --> 00:31:17,085
P.

432
00:31:38,597 --> 00:31:40,042
I missed you.

433
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,269
This time was the longest.

434
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:45,045
But you did well.

435
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,342
You brought me my da Vinci.

436
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,617
I never said I was da Vinci.

437
00:31:50,842 --> 00:31:53,686
Can you become a da Vinci?

438
00:31:53,879 --> 00:31:54,879
Well,

439
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:57,284
I'd say the odds are against it.

440
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58,551
Then don't paint.

441
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,750
Stop.

442
00:32:01,887 --> 00:32:03,560
I don't have to be da Vinci.

443
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,133
Sometimes little painters
can get as much satisfaction

444
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:07,701
as big ship owners.

445
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:10,533
Don't be so sure.

446
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,970
The bristles on your
paintbrush come from India,

447
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,371
could be one of my
ships that brought them.

448
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,444
This coffee from Brazil.

449
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:20,981
I have 22 ships that carry
trade from South America.

450
00:32:21,206 --> 00:32:25,746
This wood from Sweden,
maybe on one of my ships.

451
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,448
Tell him if that give satisfaction.

452
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:34,461
My ships cross every ocean
and bring life lo the world.

453
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,653
And a fortune to you.

454
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:38,633
That's right, and I earn it.

455
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:40,633
I love this woman.

456
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,897
I'd like to stay with her tonight,

457
00:32:43,094 --> 00:32:45,074
but in a few hours I be in the air.

458
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:45,934
ThHHOS.

459
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:47,633
Can't help it.

460
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,835
And tomorrow in New York.

461
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:54,014
Where's my beautiful ring?

462
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,412
Where's my beautiful ring?

463
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,252
I throw it into the Thames.

464
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:08,658
Don't be angry, my queen.

465
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,268
I've got to go.

466
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,094
Nico!

467
00:33:13,291 --> 00:33:14,964
How are you going to travel?

468
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,264
Nico is driving me.

469
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,132
<i>“In!</i>

470
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,172
The car is ready, sir.

471
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,604
But if Nico goes?

472
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,643
Keep the house closed, go to a hotel.

473
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:31,280
I can still get a
plane for London tonight.

474
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:35,158
I have classes tomorrow.

475
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,048
All right.

476
00:33:45,156 --> 00:33:47,295
Stay, don't go tonight.

477
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,800
Darling, it's impossible.

478
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:50,564
A million people are wailing for me.

479
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,866
Find an excuse, say you are ill.

480
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:54,805
Who would ever believe that'?

481
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,480
I've never been ill in my life.

482
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,710
It's raining.

483
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:07,352
And now, it's important for him, too.

484
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:08,752
Please-.

485
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,257
If I make this project
happen, it's an atom bomb.

486
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,758
Andreas will die.

487
00:34:18,423 --> 00:34:19,493
Come on.

488
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:26,876
So long, da Vinci.

489
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,243
You made me very happy.

490
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,878
I promise you a wonderful summer.

491
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,691
See you soon.

492
00:34:42,881 --> 00:34:44,019
So long.

493
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,421
See ya soon.

494
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,818
Ah, reservations, please.

495
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,457
Uh, hello, you still have a
flight for London tonight,

496
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:24,600
can you get me on?

497
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,789
Damn!

498
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:27,891
Excuse me.

499
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:31,901
Can you see about another line, please?

500
00:35:32,097 --> 00:35:34,839
Alexis Karilliss at 12-23-18-.

501
00:35:35,066 --> 00:35:37,239
Call me back as soon as you can, will you?

502
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,435
Thank you.

503
00:36:03,528 --> 00:36:05,439
They're calling me back

504
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,807
about the plane.

505
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:20,479
There may still be a flight on Olympic.

506
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,732
You needn't wait.

507
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,466
You must be tired.

508
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,012
Please help me.

509
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:02,422
I'm sorry you hate me again.

510
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,654
I love you.

511
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:05,690
Thank you.

512
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:10,333
When I say I love you,

513
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,031
that means I'm in love with you.

514
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,798
I'm cold.

515
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,802
I'm a little cold.

516
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:15,751
You're my first love.

517
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,300
Wait, I have to pick up a
lady, I'll be out in a minute.

518
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,324
A lady'?

519
00:41:34,459 --> 00:41:35,529
Out in a minute from Dior?

520
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,798
Please pay, I can't wait, I'm too old.

521
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,631
Ah!

522
00:41:45,703 --> 00:41:47,944
I'm looking for Mrs. Karillis, please.

523
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,277
Right upstairs.

524
00:41:49,474 --> 00:41:50,474
Thank you.

525
00:42:18,836 --> 00:42:19,836
Phaedra?

526
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:25,749
Phaedra?

527
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:27,979
Did you call me'?

528
00:42:29,147 --> 00:42:30,148
No, no, uh.

529
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,490
I'm looking for Mrs. Karillis.

530
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:37,927
I'll show you.

531
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,933
She'll be right out.

532
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:53,542
Do you like it?

533
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:57,580
It's magnificent.

534
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,379
Wait, there are others.

535
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,783
Just a minute.

536
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:03,721
Come a little closer.

537
00:43:07,852 --> 00:43:08,852
Closer.

538
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:15,692
Closer.

539
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:21,605
We're leaving.

540
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,437
I want to make love to you now.

541
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:25,739
I'll give you two minutes.

542
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:35,579
Ah, just let me...

543
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,556
Not another step.

544
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,992
Not another second.

545
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:55,570
That's pretty.

546
00:43:56,734 --> 00:43:58,680
Do you want to go out'?

547
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,517
Do you know for how many
days you haven't gone out?

548
00:44:07,111 --> 00:44:08,852
What does that mean'?

549
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,457
My love.

550
00:44:14,585 --> 00:44:15,791
Sounds funny.

551
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,523
Oh, no, it's pretty.

552
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,257
A happy word.

553
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:23,496
I'm happy,.

554
00:44:23,694 --> 00:44:25,264
Can I have a kiss'?

555
00:44:26,631 --> 00:44:27,631
Yes.

556
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,043
. New?

557
00:44:30,268 --> 00:44:31,268
Yes.

558
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:33,770
Well?

559
00:44:46,551 --> 00:44:49,498
P

560
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:17,754
I like it.

561
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,002
What's it about'?

562
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,540
Like all Greek songs,
about love and death.

563
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,453
What's it say?

564
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,796
His beloved is watching in the doorway.

565
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,645
I give you milk and honey.

566
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,756
In return you give me poison.

567
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:50,142
He loves her cold nose.

568
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:51,820
Falcon of solitude.

569
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,080
Phaedra,

570
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,028
what are we gonna do'?

571
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:02,252
Not yet.

572
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,633
We have to talk.

573
00:47:05,456 --> 00:47:06,935
Please, not yet-.

574
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:47,564
Yes.

575
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:54,571
YES.

576
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,041
YES.

577
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,379
YES.

578
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:22,506
J1 Da da da da da da da.

579
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,712
<i>I1 Ba dada da da.</i>

580
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:29,544
J1 da da.

581
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,880
J1 La la la la da da da.

582
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:38,090
<i>I1 Ba da da da da dum da dum.</i>

583
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:40,626
J1 Da da da da.

584
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,703
<i>I1 Ba ba barn ha ba barn</i>

585
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:54,970
flLa la la la la la la.

586
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:05,108
What's the matter?

587
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:06,209
Nothing.

588
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,121
What's the matter?

589
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:14,625
Don't touch me.

590
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,734
I don't recognize you.

591
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:20,994
I don't know you.

592
00:49:21,225 --> 00:49:22,829
So much the better.

593
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:27,231
Phaedra, listen, whatever it is.

594
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:36,247
It's New York.

595
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,421
They announced the call
when you were in the shower.

596
00:49:44,615 --> 00:49:48,461
Don't answer it.

597
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:56,095
Don't answer!

598
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,639
Hello, yes?

599
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:13,318
Yes, yes, I'll take it.

600
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,120
Don't.

601
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:23,890
Yes, Thanos.

602
00:50:26,223 --> 00:50:27,223
Fine.

603
00:50:28,826 --> 00:50:30,999
Yes, yes, I hear you well.

604
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:33,837
Congratulations.

605
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,300
What?

606
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:41,314
He went back to London.

607
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,909
The night you left.

608
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:47,748
He didn't say.

609
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:53,260
I know he promise, but he didn't say when.

610
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:55,486
No, I'm fine.

611
00:50:57,988 --> 00:51:00,662
No, I didn't spend too much money.

612
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:05,428
When'?

613
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:08,665
All right.

614
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:11,234
All right.

615
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,706
I look forward to seeing you.

616
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,075
YES.

617
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:22,412
YES.

618
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,588
Goodbye, Thanos.

619
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:31,881
You're coming to London with me.

620
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:33,056
That's impossible.

621
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,364
Anything else is impossible.

622
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,196
Anything else is horrible!

623
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:37,531
Don't come to Greece.

624
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:40,902
Don't come to Greece!
Anything else is ugly!

625
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,100
Don't come to Greece.

626
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,813
What does that make me'?

627
00:51:57,881 --> 00:52:00,384
What does that make you?

628
00:52:00,584 --> 00:52:02,427
What does that make you?

629
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,140
Don't come to Greece.

630
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:38,762
Welcome back, Mrs. Karillis,
I hope you had a good trip.

631
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:40,162
Very good, thank you.

632
00:52:40,357 --> 00:52:41,631
Welcome, Mrs. Karillis.

633
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,136
Mr. Karillis asked me to meet you.

634
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,160
Thank you, Stravos.

635
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:46,137
Welcome back, Mrs. Karillis, good trip?

636
00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:47,775
Very good trip, Anna, thank you.

637
00:52:47,965 --> 00:52:48,773
May I congratulate you'?

638
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:51,126
Everyone says that Mr.
Karillis' conference in New York

639
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:51,939
will bring great results.

640
00:52:52,136 --> 00:52:52,807
- Thank you.
- Do you want me to go

641
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:53,708
to go to the island

642
00:52:53,937 --> 00:52:54,608
or stay in Athens?
Stay here.

643
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:56,082
If you give me your
passport and tickets,

644
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:58,143
I'll get your through quickly.
Thank you.

645
00:52:58,342 --> 00:53:00,020
The others
waiting at the terminal.

646
00:53:00,044 --> 00:53:01,284
Welcome, Mrs. Karillis!

647
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:02,047
Thank you.

648
00:53:02,279 --> 00:53:03,289
Welcome back, Mrs. Karillis.

649
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:04,690
Thank you.

650
00:53:24,968 --> 00:53:26,345
It's Mr. Karillis!

651
00:54:15,385 --> 00:54:17,023
Phaedra!

652
00:54:41,311 --> 00:54:43,985
Poor thing, she looks so tired.

653
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,750
Somethings wrong.

654
00:54:47,084 --> 00:54:48,757
Somethings wrong.

655
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,597
Oh, my present!

656
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:09,751
Give me your hand.

657
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,424
Thanos, it's so beautiful.

658
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:22,685
Thank you.

659
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:28,095
Such a pitiful little thank you.

660
00:55:34,665 --> 00:55:37,043
Let me sleep, I'm so tired.

661
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,110
No.

662
00:55:49,813 --> 00:55:50,813
I'm tired.

663
00:56:01,325 --> 00:56:02,998
See you tomorrow.

664
00:56:22,246 --> 00:56:23,884
I'm crazy about you.

665
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:41,699
Alexis.

666
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,669
My baby, what's wrong?

667
00:57:53,603 --> 00:57:56,015
Give me a cigarette.

668
00:58:05,782 --> 00:58:07,284
What's wrong?

669
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:13,699
I hurt.

670
00:58:20,430 --> 00:58:21,430
Where?

671
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,476
Everywhere.

672
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:26,443
What is it?

673
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:27,636
Tell me.

674
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,547
Tell me like you always do, I help you.

675
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:35,354
I live only for you.

676
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,855
I don't wan! To live.

677
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:45,663
And your husband and your child,

678
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:52,167
only now in the cards I saw
a boy trampled by horses.

679
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,573
If you disappear,

680
00:58:54,798 --> 00:58:57,642
the son of the foreigner
will take everything.

681
00:58:57,834 --> 00:58:59,814
He will do evil to your son.

682
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,880
Quiet, quiet!

683
00:59:02,072 --> 00:59:05,485
Don't talk like that about him ever, ever!

684
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,822
. Baby,

685
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:13,252
turn around.

686
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,066
Let me see your face.

687
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,537
LOOK.

688
00:59:28,498 --> 00:59:29,704
LOOK.

689
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:37,873
LOOK.

690
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,409
I love him.

691
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:42,611
I love him.

692
00:59:44,681 --> 00:59:45,681
I love him!

693
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:56,069
No, I, I said I won't wait!

694
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,136
Get the number and get it now.

695
00:59:58,361 --> 01:00:00,534
And don't talk to me that way.

696
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:01,800
I don't care what!

697
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,478
Well, well then, do your job!

698
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:07,238
You had enough time to get me Bombay.

699
01:00:07,404 --> 01:00:09,441
Give me the Athens operator.

700
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:10,777
Phaedra!

701
01:00:10,974 --> 01:00:12,419
Hello, hello, Operator?

702
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,748
I've been trying for, all
right, give me Chelsea,

703
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:16,424
one, two, one, eight-.

704
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,959
This time of morning should
get London in few minutes.

705
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:22,562
Don't argue with me.

706
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:23,924
Get the number.

707
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,903
What does this telegram mean?

708
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,005
The lakes of Scotland'?

709
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:38,641
He must have said something to you.

710
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:42,510
I'd rather vacation on
the lakes of Scotland.

711
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:46,277
What the hell kind of nonsense is that?

712
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,353
You kept him away.

713
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,251
Your father called you, didn't he?

714
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,859
Your father wants to
swallow the whole world.

715
01:00:53,083 --> 01:00:54,083
All right!

716
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:55,457
He helped me in the beginning,

717
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,292
but I am not at the beginning anymore.

718
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,525
He doesn't want my son
in business with me,

719
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:01,767
and it's because of your son!

720
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:02,831
Isn't my son yours too'?

721
01:01:02,859 --> 01:01:05,430
He is, and no one wants to hurt him,

722
01:01:05,629 --> 01:01:06,801
but no more!

723
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,841
I don't want to hear anymore
Alexis dishonor the foreigner.

724
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,343
He's my son, and you'll
call him by that name,

725
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:14,209
and your father will
call him by that name!

726
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:16,508
My father knows nothing about it.

727
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:18,982
Alexis would just rather go to Scotland.

728
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:20,553
I said nonsense!

729
01:01:24,214 --> 01:01:25,352
I need him.

730
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,187
I asked for you help.

731
01:01:30,620 --> 01:01:31,655
Forgive me.

732
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:34,828
I wasn't able.

733
01:01:37,727 --> 01:01:38,727
Forgive me.

734
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,540
Ah,

735
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:54,647
I'm a bull, I make noise.

736
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,829
No, don't spoil my beautiful eyes.

737
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,725
I adore you.

738
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:13,700
If somebody talked to
you like I did just now,

739
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:15,501
I'd kill him.

740
01:02:15,699 --> 01:02:16,699
Wouldn't I?

741
01:02:17,534 --> 01:02:18,534
<i>“Mm?</i>

742
01:02:23,673 --> 01:02:25,516
My queen, my beautiful.

743
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:30,417
Phaedra?

744
01:02:30,614 --> 01:02:31,614
THBHOS!

745
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,384
Forgive me.

746
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,731
The next time I shout at you,

747
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,891
don't stop, just, just
scratch out my eyes.

748
01:02:43,059 --> 01:02:44,538
Just let me rest!

749
01:02:47,097 --> 01:02:48,097
Let me TESL.

750
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,310
Hello, yes?

751
01:02:58,541 --> 01:02:59,747
Yes!

752
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:00,943
Phaedra.

753
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:06,421
Alexis, what the hell
does that telegram mean?

754
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:08,653
You promised, boy.

755
01:03:08,885 --> 01:03:11,764
All the way from New York,
I kept saying to myself

756
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:15,493
that this summer Alexis will be with us.

757
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:17,432
More than I can tell you.

758
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:21,667
Sure, for
business, but more for you.

759
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:24,835
Are you crazy?

760
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:27,947
Wait, she wants to talk to you.

761
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,138
Please-.

762
01:03:30,006 --> 01:03:32,680
Just a second, she's coming.

763
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:33,909
Please-.

764
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,525
How are you, Alex'?

765
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:48,965
I'm all right.

766
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:52,436
Tell him how much we want him.

767
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:53,664
Please come-.

768
01:03:55,532 --> 01:03:56,532
Please-.

769
01:03:57,434 --> 01:04:00,472
Tell him I've ordered
his car, it's coming here.

770
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,946
Your car will be here,

771
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,277
your dream car.

772
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:07,644
Come quickly.

773
01:04:12,115 --> 01:04:15,460
Alexis, ah, you see?

774
01:04:15,652 --> 01:04:18,292
Yes, yes, you just call
Fergus at my office.

775
01:04:18,488 --> 01:04:20,331
He'll take care of everything.

776
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,059
After the exams.

777
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:23,292
Wonderful!

778
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,060
Wonderful!

779
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:27,129
Wonderful!

780
01:04:36,206 --> 01:04:39,050
Hurry, witch, tell me.

781
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,690
<i>Mommy!</i>

782
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,327
I see two whales and a spy submarine.

783
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:50,657
Poor little boy, and he's so amusing,

784
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,826
but I think I was condemned
to some punishment

785
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:56,003
before I was born.

786
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,934
I have no sense of being a mother.

787
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:00,698
You rememberl could never hold him,

788
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,434
afraid that his little hands would break'?

789
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:05,839
Maybe it's the mother
that's coming out now.

790
01:05:09,072 --> 01:05:11,951
Oh, no, you found the one thing

791
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:14,382
I don't have to worry about.

792
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,684
I don't have to think that
when I'm 45 he'll be 35.

793
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:23,789
We, we last like this.

794
01:05:24,020 --> 01:05:26,432
Oh, no, I'm not afraid of that.

795
01:05:28,858 --> 01:05:30,735
He'll never see me old.

796
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,199
That's my girl.

797
01:05:34,397 --> 01:05:36,240
Now I know you.

798
01:05:36,433 --> 01:05:37,935
You're laughing again.

799
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:42,640
Yes, I'm laughing, laughing.

800
01:05:52,615 --> 01:05:53,992
Quickly, quickly,

801
01:05:56,085 --> 01:05:57,085
quickly.

802
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:15,249
Got here before he did, connections.

803
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:16,576
He'll be so happy-

804
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:19,117
You don't know how much he love that car.

805
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,979
Okay-

806
01:06:22,178 --> 01:06:24,317
- Uh, Mr. Karillis?

807
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:25,857
What is it?

808
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:28,119
Don't you know, Cristo?

809
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:30,355
To me, it looks like a big coffin.

810
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:33,033
It's the fastest coffin you ever <i>saw,</i>

811
01:06:33,256 --> 01:06:36,260
driven by hundreds of horses.

812
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:39,695
Horses?

813
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,270
Don't try to figure it out, Cristo,

814
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:45,036
just let me know when
my coffin is open, huh?

815
01:07:42,025 --> 01:07:43,026
I love you.

816
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,370
Why did you make me come here?

817
01:07:46,563 --> 01:07:48,873
How did you plan it?

818
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,545
How much time in my father's bed'?

819
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,577
How much time in mine?

820
01:07:58,007 --> 01:07:59,008
You're ugly.

821
01:07:59,943 --> 01:08:00,944
You're ugly.

822
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:23,570
Hey!

823
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:26,935
. Hey!

824
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:07,012
You keep a promise.

825
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:08,483
I keep a promise.

826
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:16,322
Phaedra, what are you doing?

827
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:18,328
Go to hell!

828
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:43,686
Come on, girl.

829
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:47,049
Now we go.

830
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:50,229
(engine revs}.

831
01:09:51,621 --> 01:09:53,862
That's a good girl.

832
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:56,401
(engine revs}.

833
01:12:09,292 --> 01:12:11,169
I have got to admit.

834
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,362
You are both very amusing.

835
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:19,445
Come on, we're going out.

836
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:20,773
I arranged a little party.

837
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:21,970
We need company.

838
01:12:22,138 --> 01:12:23,811
I've invited people.

839
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,006
<i>'</i> Who?

840
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,477
Surprise.

841
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,461
Darling, they're here!

842
01:12:38,654 --> 01:12:40,656
Darling, I'm so happy to see you!

843
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,857
Uncle Thanos!

844
01:12:43,059 --> 01:12:45,733
Ercy, this is my son, Alexis.

845
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,669
Oh, wonderful to have a handsome cousin.

846
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:51,710
Not your cousin, Ercy, but
I let you kiss him anyway.

847
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:52,572
Andreas.

848
01:12:52,802 --> 01:12:54,179
Thanos, you look fine.

849
01:12:54,370 --> 01:12:56,543
Arianda, you're beautiful.

850
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:58,514
This is my son Alexis.

851
01:12:58,708 --> 01:12:59,846
Alexis.

852
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,715
You're looking well, Phaedra.

853
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:03,481
You, too, Ariadne.

854
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:06,226
Andreas.

855
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:08,019
Phaedra, Ercy.

856
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:09,184
Thanos, next lo me.

857
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:10,318
Alexis.

858
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,729
Ah, the young people together.

859
01:13:11,921 --> 01:13:13,161
Good.

860
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:15,827
There you are, speak to Alexis.

861
01:13:16,025 --> 01:13:18,904
You are your father's favorite subject.

862
01:13:19,095 --> 01:13:20,540
More than ships?

863
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,437
He's not English, he's Greek!

864
01:13:26,002 --> 01:13:27,174
Do you like the beach?

865
01:13:27,370 --> 01:13:29,008
What I've seen so far is beautiful.

866
01:13:29,205 --> 01:13:30,205
Now he's English.

867
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:35,279
Ercy, do you want to see the jukebox?

868
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,189
So then we have to go
all the way over there,

869
01:13:37,213 --> 01:13:38,624
and everyone can hear.

870
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:41,020
Pick me!

871
01:13:41,217 --> 01:13:42,217
After jukebox.

872
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:43,696
He's definitely English!

873
01:13:46,455 --> 01:13:47,525
Come on.

874
01:13:53,296 --> 01:13:56,140
Come on, Phaedra, dance with me.

875
01:13:57,133 --> 01:14:00,080
Phaedra, will you dance with me'?

876
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:13,886
Half close your eyes
like this and look at them.

877
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:14,788
Why'?

878
01:14:14,984 --> 01:14:15,984
Go ahead.

879
01:14:18,054 --> 01:14:19,499
What do you see?

880
01:14:19,722 --> 01:14:21,326
I half see the children.

881
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:24,970
And I half see us
when we were like them.

882
01:14:29,298 --> 01:14:31,141
Instead of cruising around,

883
01:14:31,334 --> 01:14:35,146
why don't you all come to
the house for a while, hmm?

884
01:14:35,338 --> 01:14:36,338
Maybe.

885
01:14:42,745 --> 01:14:43,745
Alexis,

886
01:14:46,015 --> 01:14:47,085
dance with me.

887
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,707
He's delicious, I could eat him up.

888
01:15:04,967 --> 01:15:06,947
Andreas, I'll buy you a cigar.

889
01:15:07,136 --> 01:15:08,945
I got a cigar.

890
01:15:09,138 --> 01:15:10,981
I'll buy you another one.

891
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,173
Come on.

892
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:15,953
The last time we danced,
you made up a poem.

893
01:15:16,145 --> 01:15:17,145
Do you remember?

894
01:15:17,179 --> 01:15:18,179
No.

895
01:15:18,314 --> 01:15:20,123
I do, do you want to hear it?

896
01:15:20,316 --> 01:15:21,316
No.

897
01:15:22,785 --> 01:15:24,059
Speaking of eating,

898
01:15:24,286 --> 01:15:26,994
what do you think of the
appetite of our father-in-law?

899
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:27,963
. Big-

900
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:29,157
. Big-

901
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:34,239
Separately, one by one,
he can swallow us whole,

902
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,875
but if we get together,

903
01:15:37,066 --> 01:15:38,067
indigestible.

904
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:51,513
Phaedra,

905
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,255
please help me.

906
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:56,996
Let me go.

907
01:16:00,423 --> 01:16:01,423
I can't.

908
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:32,032
Get in, come on.

909
01:16:32,221 --> 01:16:33,221
Come on.

910
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:36,636
Hey!

911
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,377
I'm not gonna be blase,
it's exciting, tremendous.

912
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:46,979
Ah, this is only the repair yard.

913
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:47,943
. Hey!

914
01:16:48,137 --> 01:16:49,548
. Hey!

915
01:16:49,738 --> 01:16:52,548
Somebody told them I
get my feet pedicured.

916
01:16:52,741 --> 01:16:54,721
I'll never live it down.

917
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,618
Hey, take your foot out of my sky!

918
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:03,093
To me, you used to be
a name in a newspaper,

919
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,822
but here I can see you and touch you.

920
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:11,134
That's a wonderful process.

921
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:14,672
You take an older ship
and cut off both ends,

922
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,774
then we make new ones, much larger,

923
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,468
and attach them to the middle.

924
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:20,613
The same ship is twice as big.

925
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,115
Extraordinary.

926
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:24,978
All this makes me feel very foolish

927
01:17:25,141 --> 01:17:27,018
with my paint box and my exams.

928
01:17:27,243 --> 01:17:29,985
I'm thinking of putting
this yard in your hands.

929
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,146
No, don't!

930
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,851
I, I mean, what would I do with it?

931
01:17:34,083 --> 01:17:36,529
You'll build it, you'll make it bigger,

932
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,663
then you'll give I! To your son.

933
01:17:38,854 --> 01:17:40,492
And when I'm old,

934
01:17:40,689 --> 01:17:43,260
you'll name a little tanker after me.

935
01:17:59,942 --> 01:18:01,478
Ercy, Emy!

936
01:18:02,778 --> 01:18:05,554
Alexis, come on, we'll
be the last ones there.

937
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:08,022
- Ercy, Ercy!
- One moment!

938
01:18:08,217 --> 01:18:09,662
One, one, one, two, three,

939
01:18:09,852 --> 01:18:11,456
one, one, remember,

940
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:13,725
we don't hold hands when
we do the cha-cha-cha,

941
01:18:13,956 --> 01:18:15,196
but always look in my eyes.

942
01:18:15,391 --> 01:18:16,802
That's what makes it sexy.

943
01:18:16,992 --> 01:18:18,062
Ercy,

944
01:18:18,294 --> 01:18:20,467
I hear every word you say.

945
01:18:20,663 --> 01:18:23,507
Mommy, you know who's
going to die of jealousy?

946
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:24,370
Who'?

947
01:18:24,567 --> 01:18:26,808
Eleni, she asked me about Alexis.

948
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:29,983
I got very mysterious and said,
I don't tell you anything,

949
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:32,709
so naturally she thinks
we're at least engaged.

950
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:34,319
Alexis,

951
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:36,421
a girl named Eleni will be at the party.

952
01:18:36,645 --> 01:18:39,558
She's old, about 24, and a man-eater.

953
01:18:39,748 --> 01:18:41,091
Yeah, yeah.

954
01:18:41,317 --> 01:18:43,160
Keep away from her.

955
01:18:43,352 --> 01:18:45,559
Mommy, may I take some of your records?

956
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:46,754
Go ahead.

957
01:18:46,855 --> 01:18:47,855
Thanks.

958
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,602
They're charming together.

959
01:18:55,698 --> 01:18:57,939
What do you think of the idea of Thanos?

960
01:18:58,167 --> 01:18:59,339
Which idea?

961
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:03,711
You know which one,
to marry the children.

962
01:19:03,906 --> 01:19:05,908
What did you say?

963
01:19:06,108 --> 01:19:07,781
You mean he didn't tell you?

964
01:19:08,010 --> 01:19:09,455
Oh, the sly one.

965
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:15,450
What is it?

966
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,517
Nothing.

967
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:21,766
Why do they play that music so loud'?

968
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:24,768
Oh, let them play, they're young.

969
01:19:26,128 --> 01:19:27,937
Well, what do you think?

970
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:30,041
It can't be, they're related.

971
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:31,232
Why'?

972
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:33,440
Alexis is not your son.

973
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,104
Ercy's a child.

974
01:19:38,073 --> 01:19:39,575
You're mad, all of you.

975
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,449
She's ripe, Phaedra, she's ripe,

976
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:45,824
and it would make us
the most powerful family

977
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,259
in Greece.
Mommy, do you think

978
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:48,283
I should wear this'?

979
01:19:48,450 --> 01:19:50,054
. <i>L</i> come up!

980
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,131
Anna, help me.

981
01:19:58,560 --> 01:20:00,631
I'm losing my mind.

982
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,604
Put that boy out of your heart,

983
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:04,607
or everything will fall.

984
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:14,849
There will be no marriage.

985
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:40,771
Hi, Mommy.

986
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:43,040
Ah, I lost a buck.

987
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,452
I wouldn't be afraid
of Eleni if I were you.

988
01:20:46,642 --> 01:20:48,212
Phaedra, he's a shark.

989
01:20:49,278 --> 01:20:50,552
Come and bring me luck.

990
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:52,383
Soon, Thanos, soon.

991
01:20:53,782 --> 01:20:55,622
That's no
way to dress for a party.

992
01:20:55,718 --> 01:20:58,392
How do you think the
others will be dressed?

993
01:21:02,191 --> 01:21:03,226
Come in.

994
01:21:07,830 --> 01:21:10,709
Your father is planning
for you to marry Ercy.

995
01:21:10,899 --> 01:21:12,071
I warn you.

996
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:13,837
I will not allow it.

997
01:21:14,036 --> 01:21:16,880
I can just imagine
what Eleni will be wearing.

998
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:23,553
'If l_, ll .3:, 1»,

999
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,712
Phaedra,

1000
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:28,353
I didn't hear what you said.

1001
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,550
Say it again.

1002
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:31,986
Clearly.

1003
01:21:32,855 --> 01:21:34,499
I said your father is planning

1004
01:21:34,523 --> 01:21:36,400
for you to marry Ercy.

1005
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:38,162
I will not allow it.

1006
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:40,232
Why'?

1007
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:42,500
How long is Eleni staying?

1008
01:21:46,068 --> 01:21:48,275
Don't provoke me, Alexis.

1009
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:53,945
I don't care if the
whole world burns down.

1010
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,679
Please, may I stay another week?

1011
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:00,523
I love you.

1012
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,272
Remember the ring?

1013
01:22:13,962 --> 01:22:16,909
I'd sacrifice anything to kiss you.

1014
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:19,934
Go on.

1015
01:22:21,804 --> 01:22:22,908
Kiss me now.

1016
01:22:25,474 --> 01:22:27,044
Here.

1017
01:22:56,939 --> 01:22:58,475
I'll kill ya.

1018
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:01,018
Let me alone or I'll kill you.

1019
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,619
I wouldn't be
afraid of Eleni if I were you.

1020
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,761
Who said I was afraid?

1021
01:23:18,126 --> 01:23:19,196
Ercy, ready'?

1022
01:23:19,428 --> 01:23:20,634
Ready, Alexis.

1023
01:23:20,829 --> 01:23:22,206
I'll kill you.

1024
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,206
Come on.

1025
01:23:33,275 --> 01:23:34,276
Phaedra.

1026
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:36,786
He loves me, Anna.

1027
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:38,890
I swear to you, he loves me.

1028
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:44,519
He loves me.

1029
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:50,691
Shh.

1030
01:24:05,340 --> 01:24:07,047
How did you know I was Eleni

1031
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:09,916
even before we were introduced'?

1032
01:24:10,145 --> 01:24:12,853
Oh, you couldn't be anyone else.

1033
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:17,652
You're the first
Englishman I ever liked.

1034
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:19,059
Fee-fi-fo-fum.

1035
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:22,699
What?

1036
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,926
I'm a woman-eater.

1037
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,866
' Change.

1038
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,539
Do I know you well enough to kiss you'?

1039
01:24:32,601 --> 01:24:33,671
No.

1040
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:35,439
Should I let that stop me'?

1041
01:24:35,671 --> 01:24:37,082
Yes.

1042
01:24:37,272 --> 01:24:38,876
Why do you want to kiss me'?

1043
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,417
I want to kiss all the girls.

1044
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:42,385
That's not very complimentary.

1045
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:45,889
I mean, uh, I wanna kiss
you because you're beautiful.

1046
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,081
' Change.

1047
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,387
Too late.

1048
01:24:58,894 --> 01:25:00,874
I saw you kiss Eleni.

1049
01:25:02,731 --> 01:25:03,971
Do you like her?

1050
01:25:05,367 --> 01:25:06,744
I don't like you.

1051
01:25:08,070 --> 01:25:10,050
Then come closer.

1052
01:25:10,238 --> 01:25:12,115
Why don't you kiss me'?

1053
01:25:13,375 --> 01:25:15,377
Because you're different

1054
01:25:15,577 --> 01:25:18,456
and because you have a buck tooth.

1055
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:19,847
Phaedra won't let me fix it.

1056
01:25:20,048 --> 01:25:21,721
She says it's charming.

1057
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,556
It is charming.

1058
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:29,592
You're a sweet, little girl.

1059
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:31,351
I'm not sweet, I'm not a little girl,

1060
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,404
and on night I'll come to
your room and seduce you

1061
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:34,771
and don't laugh.

1062
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:56,952
Hello.

1063
01:26:06,928 --> 01:26:09,966
Why are you drinking so much'?

1064
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,668
Because, little cousin, I'm thirsty.

1065
01:26:12,868 --> 01:26:15,007
You want to get drunk'?

1066
01:26:15,203 --> 01:26:16,203
<i>Mm-Hmm.</i>

1067
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:19,341
Please-.

1068
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,855
Whiskey.

1069
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,618
An Englishman is what he wears.

1070
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:30,160
In those clothes you could be Greek.

1071
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:33,688
I am Greek.

1072
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:36,223
Throw it.

1073
01:26:43,965 --> 01:26:45,911
Form fair, throw feeble.

1074
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,693
Let's try it in English.

1075
01:27:27,409 --> 01:27:29,355
Would you do this, please?

1076
01:27:29,544 --> 01:27:30,955
Would you?

1077
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:34,024
I declare myself the winner.

1078
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:41,961
A winner should get a reward.

1079
01:27:42,190 --> 01:27:44,261
I'm going down to the cabin.

1080
01:27:51,767 --> 01:27:52,767
Drink?

1081
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:53,934
No.

1082
01:27:54,069 --> 01:27:54,774
DEUCE?

1083
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:55,970
No.

1084
01:27:56,071 --> 01:27:57,414
I see you and Eleni.

1085
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:58,949
I see everything.

1086
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,319
Little cousin, you don't own me.

1087
01:28:03,545 --> 01:28:05,491
Why does everybody think they own me'?

1088
01:28:05,714 --> 01:28:06,714
Nobody owns me.

1089
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:34,852

Don't worry.

I'll be going away soon.

Kiss me-.

01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,526
Try to fall in love with me.

1106

Phaedra!

1107
01:29:57,492 --> 01:29:58,197
Phaedra!

1108
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,667
Don't call her.

Don't call her.

Go on!

Phaedra.

1114
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:05,894
I don't have time to
talk to you now, Ercy.

1115
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:07,402
I'm going to Athens.

1116
01:31:07,595 --> 01:31:08,595
Athens?

1117
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:09,401
At this time of the...

1118
01:31:09,597 --> 01:31:11,838
Don't bother me now, Ercy.

1119

Don't be angry with me.

1120
01:31:17,072 --> 01:31:21,145
It's the first time in my life
that I stayed out all night.

1121
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:24,845
I love him.

1122
01:31:26,281 --> 01:31:28,090
I want him to love me.

1123
01:31:30,251 --> 01:31:31,251
Help me.

1124
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:35,861
Tell me how to be attractive to him.

1125
01:31:36,091 --> 01:31:37,798

I don't like my perfume on other people.

Please, the child wants
to sleep a little more.

1130

It's still so early.

01:31:51,639 --> 01:31:53,676
I said

1132
01:31:53,875 --> 01:31:54,875
wake him up.

1133
01:31:58,146 --> 01:32:00,717
Oh, Phaedra, such a surprise.

1134
01:32:01,683 --> 01:32:04,357
We don't see each other enough.

1135
01:32:06,488 --> 01:32:07,990
And the little Dimitri.

1136
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:08,860
Give me a kiss.

1137
01:32:09,057 --> 01:32:10,127
Kiss your grandfather.

1138
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:14,698
I don't like it here.

1139
01:32:16,297 --> 01:32:18,004
You see that child?

1140
01:32:19,234 --> 01:32:20,804
He doesn't like me.

1141
01:32:21,903 --> 01:32:23,177
He adores you.

1142
01:32:25,040 --> 01:32:27,077
Why don't you kiss your grandfather?

1143
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:28,651
I don't like it here.

1144
01:32:28,843 --> 01:32:31,016
It's all right, all right.

1145
01:32:32,213 --> 01:32:33,851
What is it, Phaedra'?

1146
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:36,421
ThHHOS.

1147
01:32:36,651 --> 01:32:39,063
That's funny.

1148
01:32:39,254 --> 01:32:41,200
I have a call in for him now.

1149
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:43,096
He's ordered special new ships.

1150
01:32:43,324 --> 01:32:44,564
He needs capital.

1151
01:32:44,759 --> 01:32:45,499
. <i>So'?</i>

1152
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:46,763
Give it to him-.

01:32:46,995 --> 01:32:47,666
And why?

1154
01:32:47,862 --> 01:32:50,035
If you don't, Andreas will.

1155
01:32:50,231 --> 01:32:52,006
And what's wrong with that?

1156
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,613
They want to make a marriage
between Ercy and Alexis.

1157
01:32:55,837 --> 01:32:57,748
What's wrong with that?

1158
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:04,087
Everything would go to
the son of the foreigner.

1159
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:05,781
What happens to him?

1160
01:33:06,014 --> 01:33:07,049
Dimitri?

1161
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:08,955
I don't like it here, it's hot.

1162
01:33:09,184 --> 01:33:11,926
Next year, we put in air conditioning.

1163
01:33:12,120 --> 01:33:14,726
You know what air conditioning is?

1164
01:33:17,192 --> 01:33:19,297
That child never liked me!

1165
01:33:21,396 --> 01:33:22,396
Ah.

1166
01:33:25,867 --> 01:33:29,371
You have Mr. Karillis.

1167
01:33:29,571 --> 01:33:32,643
Thanos, did you change your name'?

1168
01:33:32,874 --> 01:33:34,285
Because a Mr., uh,

1169
01:33:36,111 --> 01:33:40,287
a Mr. Sarossa just bought a lot
of shares in Union Shipping.

1170
01:33:41,783 --> 01:33:44,787
I was interested in those shares.

1171
01:33:44,986 --> 01:33:47,557
Mr. Sarossa was acting for me.

1172
01:33:47,755 --> 01:33:49,598
You're nuts!

1173
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:55,231
Of course, of course you can come in.

1174
01:33:55,430 --> 01:33:57,774
Just a minute, I get a pencil.

1175
01:34:06,107 --> 01:34:07,677
Americans have an expression.

1176
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:10,412
If you can't lick them, join them!

1177
01:34:26,594 --> 01:34:29,336
Andreas, I'm formally
asking your daughter's hand

1178
01:34:29,497 --> 01:34:32,171
in marriage with my son.

1179
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:33,437
Given.

1180
01:34:33,635 --> 01:34:34,272

1181
01:34:34,469 --> 01:34:35,106
. Hey!

1182
01:34:35,303 --> 01:34:37,183
Call my house, tell
Alexis to go to my office!

1183
01:34:37,272 --> 01:34:38,272
Okay!
<i>'</i> Aye!

1184
01:34:45,113 --> 01:34:46,113
How many?

1185
01:34:47,782 --> 01:34:48,782
Of course.

1186
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:49,883
Good, good.

1187
01:34:50,952 --> 01:34:51,952
What?

1188
01:34:53,454 --> 01:34:54,489
Bravo, bravo.

1189
01:35:04,465 --> 01:35:06,206
Phaedra, listen to me.

1190
01:35:08,036 --> 01:35:11,347
Andreas has just promised Ercy to Alexis.

1191
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,748
And, Phaedra, I think it's a good thing.

1192
01:35:23,184 --> 01:35:24,184
Phaedra!

1193
01:35:25,486 --> 01:35:26,664
Take the boy home.

1194
01:35:26,688 --> 01:35:28,861
Phaedra, Phaedra!

1195
01:35:29,057 --> 01:35:30,058
Let him alone.

1196
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:33,672
What he's building is very big.

1197
01:35:33,861 --> 01:35:35,704
It will fall,

1198
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:36,897
everything.

1199
01:35:39,534 --> 01:35:41,445
Better come to the
office right away, Thanos.

1200
01:35:41,669 --> 01:35:43,945
One of our ships has been lost.

1201
01:35:44,172 --> 01:35:45,913
There are casualties.

1202
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:48,883
Thanos, come by the back entrance.

1203
01:35:49,077 --> 01:35:51,353
The families of the crew
are coming from everywhere.

1204
01:35:51,546 --> 01:35:54,049
They are all over the building.

1205
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,022
It's the SS Phaedra.

1206
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,624
Tell me.

1207
01:36:38,893 --> 01:36:41,237
It was not far from the coast of Norway,

1208
01:36:41,429 --> 01:36:43,136
a violent squall.

1209
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:45,607
She was dragged against a reef.

1210
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:49,179
The whole crew was magnificent, but.

1211
01:36:49,404 --> 01:36:50,404
The list'?

1212
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:05,689
Many friends.

1213
01:37:07,955 --> 01:37:09,935
It's terrible.

1214
01:37:15,463 --> 01:37:18,467
It was not for this I asked you to come.

1215
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:21,112
It was for another reason,

1216
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:23,009
a happy reason.

1217
01:37:26,607 --> 01:37:28,314
What did you tell the families?

1218
01:37:28,509 --> 01:37:30,352
What could I tell them?

1219
01:37:30,545 --> 01:37:33,185
They want to know about the missing.

1220
01:37:33,381 --> 01:37:35,827
We don't have any details yet.

1221
01:37:55,303 --> 01:37:57,214
We have no names yet.

1222
01:37:57,405 --> 01:37:59,078
We are waiting.

1223
01:37:59,307 --> 01:38:01,378
There was a terrible storm.

1224
01:38:02,677 --> 01:38:06,750
The crew without exception
showed a great courage.

1225
01:38:06,981 --> 01:38:09,018
As soon as we have the names,

1226
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,561
we'll notify you at your home.

1227
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:14,430
Please, go home.

1228
01:38:18,993 --> 01:38:19,993
Please-.

1229
01:38:59,467 --> 01:39:01,538
Oh, Mrs. Karillis, I
can'! Open this door.

1230
01:39:01,736 --> 01:39:05,377
Go next door to Mr.
Karillis' private office.

1231
01:39:11,913 --> 01:39:13,551
I want to see Mr. Karillis.

1232
01:39:13,748 --> 01:39:15,025
I don't think he can come now, I...

1233
01:39:15,049 --> 01:39:16,049
At once-.

1234
01:39:17,418 --> 01:39:19,295
There is no authority
for an investigation

1235
01:39:19,487 --> 01:39:20,591
outside of Greece.

1236
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,188
She was sailing under a Greek flag.

1237
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:24,497
The whole crew was Greek.

1238
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:26,365
What the hell do I care about the press'?

1239
01:39:26,561 --> 01:39:27,561
Mrs. Karillis is here.

1240
01:39:27,628 --> 01:39:29,437
I can'! Now.

1241
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,735
What, what repairs?

1242
01:39:31,933 --> 01:39:33,344
That ship was brand new.

1243
01:39:33,568 --> 01:39:34,568
She insists.

1244
01:39:34,602 --> 01:39:35,602
Damn!

1245
01:39:36,237 --> 01:39:37,580
Just a minute.

1246
01:39:37,772 --> 01:39:38,773
Alexis, please.

1247
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,146
Tell him I want the bodies sent to Athens.

1248
01:39:41,342 --> 01:39:42,822
Mr. Karillis can't talk to you now.

1249
01:39:44,278 --> 01:39:45,484
Thanos, don't.

1250
01:39:46,681 --> 01:39:47,761
Of course he's emotional.

1251
01:39:47,915 --> 01:39:48,484
Wouldn't you be?

1252
01:39:48,683 --> 01:39:50,403
Listen, as soon as (he
bodies are recovered,

1253
01:39:50,585 --> 01:39:51,359
send them to Athens.

1254

but I can't talk to you now.

1257

Only a minute.

1258
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:58,769
I tell you it's impossible.

1259
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:02,263
Thanos, the marriage
will not take place.

1260
01:40:02,463 --> 01:40:03,168
What marriage?

1261
01:40:03,364 --> 01:40:05,139
What the devil are you talking about?

1262
01:40:05,333 --> 01:40:08,109
The marriage between Ercy and Alexis.

1263
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:09,975
Is that what you came to tell me now?

1264

I love Alexis.

I didn't touch her.

Explain to me!

1281
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:53,304
Why didn't you leave me where I was?

And your finance?

And your business?

And your taxes'?
