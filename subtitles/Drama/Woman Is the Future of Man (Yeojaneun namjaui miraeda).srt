- Quite a climb...
- Kind of

10
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,218
Luckily, the bus stop isn't far

11
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,222
- How are you keeping?
- We're on a hill

12
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,474
Cab drivers get lost up here

13
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,976
The bus is better

14
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:42,478
Yes

15
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:47,942
ls this your house?
It's beautiful!

16
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,486
Sorry to have brought you so far

17
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:54,698
No, don't apologize
This way, I get to see your place

18
00:01:54,824 --> 00:01:56,659
That's true

19
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:02,123
Actually
the house is a real mess

20
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:04,583
my wife wants us
to go elsewhere

21
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,965
- Do you mind?
- All right

22
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:16,554
- So, how are you doing?
- Good

23
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,514
I have a present for you

24
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,849
A present?

25
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:24,395
It's not much
Now you're here

26
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,980
you may as well take a look

27
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:42,413
You're a rich man now!

28
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,792
My wife is
a very determined woman

29
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:51,046
We've settled here for good

30
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,676
but a 200-million-won mortgage
the loans from relatives...

31
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:58,304
It will take forever to pay that off

32
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:02,600
Well, you've certainly changed

33
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:04,476
I haven't

34
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,105
The present that I mentioned

35
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:13,736
- ls this snow, the first...
- It's a little late this year

36
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,738
You can walk on it

37
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,910
It's beautiful
I kept the dog off it

38
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:22,661
You even have a dog

39
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:28,667
- Walk on it?
- If you'd like to

40
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,920
All right

41
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:52,107
It will look like someone walked
just one way

42
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,485
When you went in and back out

43
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,660
- Shall we go?
- All right

44
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:04,745
Let's go

45
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:17,925
- This is great
- You don't have a mobile?

46
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:21,095
- I got rid of it
- Why?

47
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:25,432
I've forgotten my wallet
I'll be right back

48
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:26,934
I'll wait here

49
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:46,495
- Who is it?
- It's me, open up

50
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,247
- Munho?
- Yes

51
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:50,457
Munho, is that you?
Just a second

52
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:00,718
- Thank you, good-bye
- Thanks

53
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,229
- Thank you
- Good-bye

54
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,529
- What was university like there?
- Hm...

55
00:05:21,322 --> 00:05:23,282
How can I put it...

56
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,412
It's a good university
they all say so

57
00:05:28,579 --> 00:05:31,040
On the staff, they have

58
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,584
one particularly good lecturer

59
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:35,919
I took his class in the end

60
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,173
Know what he said about my film?

61
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,301
That it's a "gem"

62
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:46,555
A "gem"? What's that?

63
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,558
A "gem"?
A precious stone

64
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:51,518
A precious stone?

65
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:54,521
Isn't the word "treasure"?

66
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,566
Treasure can mean stones too

67
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,611
But a lot of them

68
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:04,406
Gem is one stone
and "treasure" is a lot

69
00:06:13,332 --> 00:06:16,418
You were wise
to change your main subject

70
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,879
You're a smart one

71
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:24,968
- Smart, me
- Every university has a film department

72
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:29,390
Dozens have opened
in the last few years

73
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:31,266
University?

74
00:06:32,184 --> 00:06:35,104
I don't want to teach
I want to make films

75
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:40,859
You're right
Make films

76
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,865
So, you're not going to teach?

77
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:49,868
Well...

78
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:53,247
if a university in Seoul asks me to
why not?

79
00:06:54,415 --> 00:06:55,999
I need to make a living

80
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:03,715
Exactly, all these film students
what will they do?

81
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,428
Korean and English film isn't alike

82
00:07:09,638 --> 00:07:13,600
It will be hard for them
I pity them

83
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:22,734
I'll write a screenplay first
I'll need time to adjust here

84
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:28,991
This will make you laugh
When I went back for my wallet

85
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:33,829
my wife was smoking
in the bathroom

86
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,832
Does she smoke?

87
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:41,211
Usually, no!
I caught her red-handed

88
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:43,380
Really?

89
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,759
But I didn't say anything

90
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:50,762
Before, I'd have kicked up a fuss

91
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,806
Now...

92
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:57,436
I see her
less as a woman or a wife

93
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:00,981
and more as a human being

94
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:06,653
I tell her, "Live your life!"
Something like that

95
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:14,578
You're kind to her
Then again, it's best not to smoke

96
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,748
When she sleeps by our kid

97
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:20,125
she looks so beautiful

98
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:27,966
I believe that proves
that she's a good wife

99
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:35,474
True, you made a good match
You're lucky to have met her

100
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:43,273
By the way, if you hug my wife again
you'll hear from me!

101
00:08:45,484 --> 00:08:46,568
What do you mean?

102
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,530
Remember when we visited you
in the USA

103
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,783
you hugged her "American-style"

104
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,910
- I didn't say anything...
- Hey, that's just...

105
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:56,453
I didn't hug her...

106
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,247
- That's hello
- Shut your mouth!

107
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:05,045
Just don't do that!
You're not a Yankee!

108
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,431
Chili pepper noodles

109
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,102
- Here you are
- Just a second, please

110
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:21,728
- I'm sorry but...
- Huh?

111
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,232
I make films

112
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,859
Are you interested in acting?

113
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:30,028
- Films?
- Yes

114
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:35,993
I'm a director

115
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,746
I'm looking for real people

116
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:43,375
to play parts in my film

117
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:46,670
Not for a documentary
but for a real film

118
00:09:47,588 --> 00:09:49,756
I don't think so

119
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,552
Why not? Don't I seem honest?

120
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,056
You have an interesting face

121
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:00,559
That's why I'm insisting

122
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:06,565
I'll give you my number
You'll think about it?

123
00:10:06,982 --> 00:10:10,444
No, really
I couldn't do it

124
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,195
I'll leave you now

125
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,199
Come here

126
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,202
ls something wrong?

127
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,121
What did he say?

128
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:23,123
He's a director

129
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,335
- He wants me to be in a film
- What kind of director?

130
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,755
- I don't know
- He's a director?

131
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,633
- So he says
- He asked you to act?

132
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,136
The idea of it!

133
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,891
You lack ambition
That's why life disappoints you

134
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:43,769
Look, he's watching you

135
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,076
Hello

136
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:45,455
What are you doing here?
What's up?

137
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,708
Are you well?

138
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:51,586
If you're not busy, we can talk...

139
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,298
I'd like to but...

140
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,008
ls your military service over now?

141
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,096
You didn't know?

142
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,975
I didn't know
So, how are you?

143
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:09,479
Why don't we go somewhere
to talk?

144
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:15,360
What about?
I'm supposed to meet a friend

145
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,238
You'll meet your friend

146
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:21,867
This won't take long, come on

147
00:12:27,164 --> 00:12:29,249
I just got out of the army

148
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,172
You really don't have a minute?

149
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:40,635
I know but...
Can't it wait a day?

150
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,929
I have to meet a friend

151
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,057
Sunhwa!

152
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,188
Look at me!

153
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,815
It's me!

154
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,696
Snap out of it!

155
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,619
Don't do this to me

156
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:08,622
I'll bring you back in no time

157
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,170
Quickly, then

158
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,207
Why do you always
keep me waiting?

159
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,085
Sorry

160
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,090
What's wrong?

161
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,885
Have you been waiting long?

162
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:15,146
It's a beautiful day

163
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:19,818
Sorry, I'm late again

164
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,822
What's the matter?

165
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,704
Yesterday...

166
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,374
I was kidnapped

167
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:41,006
I'm really sorry

168
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:43,884
I was kidnapped

169
00:14:44,718 --> 00:14:47,137
and taken by force to Puchon

170
00:14:50,599 --> 00:14:51,808
By whom?

171
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:58,356
A guy I know
He turned up out of the blue

172
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,027
He found me
after he got out of the army

173
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:04,863
He knew we see each other

174
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:08,617
He knew what time
I go to the hospital

175
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:10,493
He was waiting for me

176
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,499
Who is this guy?

177
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,672
We used to be in the same club
at high school

178
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:27,677
And then...

179
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,685
Well? What happened?

180
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:43,735
In Puchon, he took me to a hotel

181
00:15:45,987 --> 00:15:49,950
And there, he raped me

182
00:16:13,223 --> 00:16:17,560
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay...

183
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,580
- Not too hot?
- It's ok

184
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:10,739
That's enough

185
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:37,724
I'm making love to you to cleanse you
You understand?

186
00:18:04,042 --> 00:18:06,878
I'll really be clean again?

187
00:18:16,221 --> 00:18:17,806
Of course

188
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,726
I'll make you clean

189
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:26,272
You'll be clean again

190
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:32,695
- You understand?
- I want to be clean

191
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:36,491
Make me clean

192
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,724
- Why are you here, Dad?
- You're here?

193
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,812
- You mustn't smoke
- Just one cigarette

194
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:10,817
- ls there time?
- Yes

195
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,736
Remember what I said

196
00:19:13,862 --> 00:19:18,408
You must be
both daring and reliable

197
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:19,784
- Yep
- You understand?

198
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:21,161
I understand

199
00:19:21,452 --> 00:19:22,912
What are you doing here?

200
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,664
- Hello, sir
- You're here!

201
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,665
- How are you, sir?
- Good

202
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:29,711
- Why are you all alone?
- I need to talk to you

203
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:30,920
What about?

204
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:34,549
I'll leave you two to talk
Don't be too long

205
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,050
We'll catch up

206
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:37,802
You can talk inside

207
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,429
We won't be long

208
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,555
Okay

209
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:48,062
- I have to talk to you
- What's the matter?

210
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,191
One thing bothers me

211
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:55,195
Sunhwa should be here
to see you off to the USA

212
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:56,905
Sunhwa?

213
00:19:57,113 --> 00:20:00,700
She knows you're leaving
You have to see her

214
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,494
You can't just leave like this!

215
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,999
What's it to do with you?

216
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,085
That's what you had to tell me?

217
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,631
I told her to come here
It's the right thing to do

218
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,507
What?

219
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:20,220
She's on her way
She'll be here soon

220
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,107
Come here

221
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,242
Take care
You'll wait for me, right?

222
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:37,380
I'll call you
Look after yourself, won't you?

223
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:41,676
I'll wait
I'll wait for your call

224
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,053
All right

225
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:54,897
Why are you crying?
Don't be silly!

226
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,359
All right, I'll stop crying

227
00:22:03,698 --> 00:22:04,741
I love you

228
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:07,952
Me too

229
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:46,324
Munho!
Do you remember Sunhwa?

230
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:51,704
How could I forget her?

231
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:53,831
Right

232
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,711
What's she doing these days?

233
00:22:59,921 --> 00:23:02,882
I don't know
How could I know?

234
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,928
That's right
It's been ages

235
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,561
You want to know?

236
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,692
I heard she runs a bar in Puchon

237
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:23,569
What?

238
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:30,076
A friend said he saw her
in Puchon

239
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,537
It's probably true
Why would he lie?

240
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:36,332
- You said you didn't know
- You wanted to know

241
00:23:39,544 --> 00:23:45,591
She was working in that kind of place
when she was a student

242
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:49,053
She dropped out of university

243
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:51,264
Really? Why?

244
00:23:51,806 --> 00:23:53,015
I don't know

245
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:58,521
I don't think
she's a waitress anymore

246
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:01,607
She runs a bar in a hotel

247
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:06,320
How did she come to that?

248
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:08,948
I wonder

249
00:24:13,411 --> 00:24:14,829
I can't believe it...

250
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:20,376
- It all started from then
- What?

251
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:23,212
These so-called "club rooms"

252
00:24:23,337 --> 00:24:27,925
Half the girls are students
More than two thirds even!

253
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:29,969
I see

254
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:36,476
A real job is tough
and doesn't pay well

255
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:41,355
The myth of virginity means
girls have a high price on them

256
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,983
Koreans are too fond of sex

257
00:24:44,734 --> 00:24:46,777
They have nothing better to do

258
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:50,865
- There's no real culture
- Right

259
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,660
Excuse me
I have to fetch my photos

260
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:58,581
- They're already done?
- It's an express service

261
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:16,349
Can I have a quick word with you?

262
00:25:16,516 --> 00:25:17,850
Yes

263
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,482
I teach Western art
I was wondering...

264
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,443
would you like to model for me?

265
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,487
Model for you?

266
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,074
Yes, I teach at the university

267
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,243
You can trust me

268
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:39,956
I'm looking for
non-professional models

269
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:41,415
I see...

270
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,420
However, I must warn you
you'd have to pose nude

271
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:48,881
Could you do that?

272
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,426
No, I couldn't

273
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:56,264
Because of the nudity?
I understand

274
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:01,269
Let me give you my number
Think about it

275
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,482
You'd make an excellent model

276
00:26:08,025 --> 00:26:12,238
No, really
I couldn't do it

277
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:13,990
I'll leave you now

278
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,912
Come here

279
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,540
ls something wrong?

280
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,626
What's he saying?

281
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,129
That he's a teacher

282
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:31,632
- He wants me to model
- A teacher needs a model?

283
00:26:31,966 --> 00:26:34,802
- He's a painter
- ls he really?

284
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:36,762
Apparently

285
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:40,391
- That's all he said?
- I'm not going to model for him

286
00:26:41,767 --> 00:26:45,479
They don't look
like close friends

287
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,441
But they're knocking the drink back

288
00:26:48,524 --> 00:26:50,484
That's why
they talk such rubbish

289
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,194
You think so?

290
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:37,198
- Hello
- Hello

291
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,700
Go on in

292
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:42,453
Are you going out?

293
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,538
We won't be long

294
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:47,541
Good-bye

295
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,477
- Where shall I put this?
- Over there

296
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,611
What is that?

297
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,490
An imaginary being

298
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:29,959
What beautiful flowers!

299
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:36,590
In autumn
when I see chrysanthemums

300
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:40,010
I feel that they have bloomed
just for me

301
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:42,972
I see

302
00:28:44,432 --> 00:28:47,643
They're really beautiful
aren't they?

303
00:28:50,813 --> 00:28:52,148
By the way...

304
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:56,569
May I call you by your first name?
I'm sorry?

305
00:28:59,363 --> 00:29:00,740
If you want

306
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,326
All right

307
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:31,812
Stop it! Not so fast!

308
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,906
Get off me!

309
00:29:43,115 --> 00:29:44,325
What did I just say?

310
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,702
I told you to stop!

311
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,747
I didn't understand

312
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:57,713
Was it unpleasant?

313
00:29:58,255 --> 00:30:00,216
Couldn't you have just held me?

314
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:04,053
Men are all alike

315
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:11,560
If you'd simply held me
I could have let myself go

316
00:30:23,906 --> 00:30:25,241
I'm sorry

317
00:30:26,242 --> 00:30:27,952
It's my fault

318
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,625
You're all animals

319
00:30:35,459 --> 00:30:37,628
You and that bastard
just want sex

320
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,338
Real animals!

321
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,914
- Hello
- Hello

322
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,876
You're here?
Do you know the bride?

323
00:31:17,001 --> 00:31:19,211
The groom is an old friend

324
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:22,506
- Are you close?
- Yeah

325
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:26,594
This morning, I was in a cafe

326
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,846
and I called Sunhwa

327
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:35,227
She said she'd be at the wedding
I was coming anyway

328
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:37,396
so it was a chance to see her

329
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:42,526
- That's a good idea
- Shall we fetch her?

330
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:43,986
Will you do that for me?

331
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:45,529
Thank you

332
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:48,032
She's over there

333
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:49,283
Sunhwa!

334
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,785
Congratulations
You look so pretty

335
00:32:02,463 --> 00:32:03,881
They're intrigued

336
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:06,508
The groom is a friend...

337
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:11,805
- It's a pretty wedding
- The bride's pretty too

338
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:16,393
I find you much prettier

339
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,563
Don't exaggerate

340
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:24,234
- Seen the chrysanthemums?
- I see

341
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,571
They attract the bees

342
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,576
Are you staying?
Are you going to the reception?

343
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,995
- Aren't you?
- No

344
00:32:35,204 --> 00:32:37,539
I have to go to see my tutor

345
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,875
Really?

346
00:32:40,042 --> 00:32:43,754
- Do you go there often?
- No

347
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:49,134
I'm sorry you can't come

348
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:56,517
Could I see you tomorrow?

349
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,857
- What day is it tomorrow?
- What day?

350
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:08,320
- It's Sunday
- That's right

351
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,408
All right, let's meet tomorrow

352
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,577
- Really?
- Really!

353
00:33:15,703 --> 00:33:16,912
Thank you

354
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,542
You're not using my first name?

355
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:25,004
I don't really feel like it

356
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:58,620
- Did it go well yesterday?
- Yes, sit down

357
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:08,297
Your face is puffy

358
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:14,678
- It is?
- Yes, very puffy

359
00:34:16,346 --> 00:34:17,890
Do you feel all right?

360
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,684
Yes...

361
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,983
What's that new hairstyle?

362
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,944
Is it horrible?

363
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:34,448
No

364
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,718
Isn't anyone else home?

365
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:58,388
My father's in Japan
My mother will be home late

366
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,682
Your father's in Japan?

367
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:05,896
He goes there
about ten times a year

368
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,690
And your mother?

369
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:12,444
When he's away
she comes home late

370
00:35:12,694 --> 00:35:16,532
There's no one else here?

371
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:21,829
My little brother
will be home late too

372
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,123
You needn't worry about him

373
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:28,085
It's better
when there's no one else

374
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:30,712
Well, there isn't

375
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:39,847
What's that?

376
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:43,600
That? It's just for fun

377
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:46,937
What's inside it?
What is it?

378
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:51,191
- Are they stones?
- Pebbles

379
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,778
Are they for your work?

380
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:59,158
No, It's to toughen my fist

381
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:02,744
- Toughen your fist?
- My fist

382
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,831
I punch it
every morning and evening

383
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:09,001
You do that?

384
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:13,255
To make me stronger

385
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,718
Every morning and evening?

386
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,804
Yes, Like this

387
00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:01,428
Your skin is so soft

388
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,684
Can I moan?

389
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:13,523
Go ahead
You can

390
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:26,787
Your moaning sounds so sweet

391
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,629
ls that good?

392
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,174
Very good

393
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:08,078
Sorry
I came too soon

394
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,582
Are you always like that?

395
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,450
What?

396
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,037
Your legs are hairy

397
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:37,417
I haven't shaved them for a while

398
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:40,087
Shaving makes the hair thicker

399
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,385
I didn't know
that women shaved their legs

400
00:39:50,263 --> 00:39:52,432
True, it has grown

401
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:31,012
I hear there's even more snow
in Kangwon province

402
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,056
It snows often

403
00:40:35,892 --> 00:40:39,229
Shall we go and see Sunhwa?

404
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,730
- Now?
- Yep

405
00:40:41,231 --> 00:40:44,568
Ask your friend for the address

406
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,738
- You want to go to Puchon?
- Since it's snowing...

407
00:40:50,282 --> 00:40:53,368
Let's go and see Sunhwa

408
00:40:53,952 --> 00:40:57,414
- You go I'm not going
- Why not?

409
00:40:57,539 --> 00:41:02,794
I enjoyed drinking with you
but we're pretty drunk now

410
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:04,796
So what?

411
00:41:05,088 --> 00:41:08,300
Your face isn't even flushed

412
00:41:08,425 --> 00:41:12,262
I have some papers to mark
Sorry

413
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,765
Go by yourself
Why not?

414
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,811
How can you treat
an old friend like this?

415
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,609
You go!
My wife doesn't feel well

416
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,488
- I didn't tell you before
- She doesn't feel well?

417
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,990
She's a bit ill

418
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,659
I don't know...

419
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,957
I'll tell you the hotel's name

420
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,673
ls she really ill?

421
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,428
All this is just an excuse

422
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,138
Shall I call her to check?

423
00:41:55,305 --> 00:41:58,266
Asshole!
What are you talking about?

424
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,273
I'm sorry but...
you're fishing for an excuse!

425
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,737
If I were you, I'd come

426
00:42:10,779 --> 00:42:13,240
We've just met up again

427
00:42:13,406 --> 00:42:14,991
You can't do this to me

428
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:18,954
It's snowing, we're drunk
where can we go like this?

429
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,998
Bastard

430
00:42:31,091 --> 00:42:34,344
- Do you want a sweet?
- Yes, thank you

431
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,437
- Munho
- Huh?

432
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:47,524
What is it that you want
more than anything?

433
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:49,985
Me?

434
00:42:53,738 --> 00:42:55,240
There is one thing I want...

435
00:42:57,033 --> 00:43:01,788
It's an old dream
Perhaps it won't come true

436
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:06,585
But I like having it

437
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:11,298
I'll succeed, even if it's tough

438
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,675
Hunjoon

439
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:18,680
I think our university
is the best in all of Korea

440
00:43:18,888 --> 00:43:21,349
And I want to get tenure there

441
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:25,103
That's my dream

442
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,029
Won't that come true soon?

443
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:38,992
I have no idea

444
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:43,288
No one can really say
until it actually happens

445
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,457
I can imagine

446
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:52,339
But it will come true
You'll make a good teacher

447
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:58,970
Thank you

448
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,348
Sure

449
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:44,224
It's on the ground floor, isn't it?

450
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,433
Yes

451
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,727
It must be just inside

452
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,146
It's stupid arriving together

453
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,857
I'll go, wait here for me

454
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,487
- Let's see if she's there
- That's why I'm going in

455
00:44:57,529 --> 00:44:58,988
It's stupid going in together

456
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,658
Wait, I'll come back

457
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:46,911
You aren't too cold?

458
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,040
Let me see!
Are they from the bar?

459
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,335
Do you want to look inside?

460
00:45:55,837 --> 00:45:58,631
Is it anything special?

461
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:01,384
It's just a bar
without windows

462
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:05,138
Forget it, then

463
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:08,057
Sunhwa told me to wait for her

464
00:46:08,141 --> 00:46:12,103
- She hasn't finished yet
- Only natural for a bar

465
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:15,690
Where did she say to wait?

466
00:46:16,733 --> 00:46:18,818
Apparently, she lives nearby

467
00:46:19,861 --> 00:46:25,325
I think I should wait for her
Will you be all right?

468
00:46:25,825 --> 00:46:28,036
I think I should wait for her

469
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,330
What can I do? She insisted

470
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:32,791
Let's wait, then

471
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:37,670
How long will she be?

472
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,881
She could be a while

473
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,384
Will you be okay?

474
00:46:49,766 --> 00:46:51,601
Let's wait for her

475
00:46:51,768 --> 00:46:52,852
You want to?

476
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,230
Okay...

477
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,276
Give me the matches

478
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,799
Good-bye

479
00:47:51,744 --> 00:47:53,204
Have you seen the time?

480
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,338
What's the matter?

481
00:48:03,214 --> 00:48:04,299
What?

482
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:06,885
You must be tired

483
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:09,804
You can go

484
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,016
It's late

485
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:18,646
What the hell
do you mean?

486
00:48:18,813 --> 00:48:22,692
Eat some chicken
Come on, drink up!

487
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:42,045
I used to drink
liquor with chicken every day

488
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,505
That's all Sunhwa and I ever had

489
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:46,799
Sunhwa and you?

490
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:54,015
Every day liquor and chicken

491
00:48:58,144 --> 00:49:00,396
It's not very important...

492
00:49:02,774 --> 00:49:05,109
But there's stuff you don't know

493
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:07,654
What?

494
00:49:08,988 --> 00:49:11,824
When you left for the USA

495
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:14,285
Sunhwa suffered a great deal

496
00:49:16,788 --> 00:49:17,830
She did?

497
00:49:18,498 --> 00:49:20,708
Everyone blamed you

498
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:23,878
For dumping her so cruelly

499
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:28,216
That's all crap spread by assholes!

500
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:31,177
Fucking morons!

501
00:49:33,846 --> 00:49:36,808
- Know what she told me?
- What?

502
00:49:37,016 --> 00:49:43,356
That you're the worst kind of animal
She told me that one day

503
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:49,946
Here you are!

504
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:55,910
- Been waiting long?
- You've come!

505
00:49:56,369 --> 00:50:00,248
- You're here!
- Shall we go? Come on

506
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:03,793
Where? You just got here

507
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:05,420
Have a drink

508
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:12,218
I'm tired, I'm happy to see you
but let's get out of here

509
00:50:12,802 --> 00:50:14,262
Are you tired?

510
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:17,682
Get up, I'm tired

511
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,019
I hate the smell of chicken

512
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:22,395
Really?

513
00:50:23,771 --> 00:50:25,606
Let's go, then

514
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:41,956
- How much do we owe?
- Just a second

515
00:50:42,582 --> 00:50:47,170
Squid
Three bottles of Soju

516
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:51,215
four beers, chicken...

517
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:05,646
You really went there
this morning?

518
00:51:06,314 --> 00:51:12,528
Yes, I woke up way too early

519
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,574
Why did you photograph this?

520
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:23,581
Because that's the place
where I treated you so badly

521
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:35,593
I wanted to go back
and confront the past

522
00:51:35,968 --> 00:51:38,054
and see that place again

523
00:51:41,182 --> 00:51:43,518
So you admit it?

524
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:48,481
I treated you badly

525
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:55,238
So you took these photos?

526
00:51:55,947 --> 00:51:57,657
To show them to me?

527
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,660


528
00:52:01,661 --> 00:52:05,206
It made me realize
how much I miss you

529
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:11,838
Munho helped me

530
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:21,389
The teashop hasn't changed

531
00:52:21,514 --> 00:52:24,725
It has, a little...

532
00:52:24,934 --> 00:52:28,896
It's the same outside
but the inside has changed

533
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:32,650
It looks the same

534
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:39,031
I've been back there too

535
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,576
Really?

536
00:52:44,412 --> 00:52:50,126
I knew it before
but you're a funny man

537
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:55,506
Me? Funny?

538
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:58,759
Good

539
00:53:01,304 --> 00:53:03,139
What's wrong with your tooth?

540
00:53:04,557 --> 00:53:06,142
My tooth?

541
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,229
- It's chipped
- He's right

542
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:17,361
You have sharp eyes
You noticed it?

543
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,907
- How did that happen?
- Not so long ago...

544
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:24,327
That's my neighbor

545
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,621
She's a yoga instructor

546
00:53:31,083 --> 00:53:32,418
You're here!

547
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:33,878
Here's my baby...

548
00:53:36,547 --> 00:53:38,758
Come to mommy

549
00:53:39,592 --> 00:53:40,301
Come here!

550
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,845
Isn't my baby beautiful?

551
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,223
Is she yours?

552
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,850
- My baby... Isn't she beautiful?
- She's big

553
00:53:48,017 --> 00:53:50,478
You have to obey mommy

554
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:57,109
- You peed in her house?
- Yes, I scolded her

555
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,571
- What's her name?
- Mary

556
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,657
- She's excited
- Mary...

557
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:06,827
- Mary, come here
- Be careful

558
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:08,704
- Mary
- Be good

559
00:54:08,871 --> 00:54:11,082
She's excited

560
00:54:14,794 --> 00:54:16,212
She's so dark black dog!

561
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,589
Mary, the black dog

562
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:22,260
Hey, that hurts
Let go

563
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:43,781
Sunhwa

564
00:54:46,742 --> 00:54:48,411
Are you happy?

565
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:54,166
I have no idea
What does that mean?

566
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:02,633
It's been a while, you and me

567
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:07,013
You must be happy

568
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:12,643
You look good
Have you put on weight?

569
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,695
Did you bring Hunjoon here?

570
00:55:23,863 --> 00:55:28,409
I was the one
who wanted to come

571
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:30,828
Why?

572
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:35,833
I don't know

573
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:42,715
It was snowing and...
that made me sentimental

574
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,470
Stop it

575
00:55:50,639 --> 00:55:53,809
- Sunhwa
- What?

576
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,855
I'll buy some food
There's nothing left here

577
00:55:58,397 --> 00:56:01,359
Are you going alone?

578
00:56:02,568 --> 00:56:04,904
Hunjoon is drunk

579
00:56:05,071 --> 00:56:08,532
- Hunjoon, are you okay?
- I'm okay

580
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,660
Put him to bed I won't be long

581
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:36,727
Stop drinking!

582
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:40,481
Yeah

583
00:56:46,654 --> 00:56:49,240
What are you trying to prove?

584
00:56:52,952 --> 00:56:54,370
Give me that

585
00:57:02,211 --> 00:57:03,754
Burn me

586
00:57:05,464 --> 00:57:06,799
Burn me!

587
00:57:08,968 --> 00:57:11,804
Burn me!

588
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:15,474
Somebody burn me!

589
00:57:16,225 --> 00:57:20,438
Burn me! Burn me!

590
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:26,694
You want me to do it?

591
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,843
You know how I waited for you?

592
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:57,725
Do you have any idea
how I waited?

593
00:58:04,106 --> 00:58:05,691
You waited for me?

594
00:58:10,863 --> 00:58:11,906
Is that true?

595
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:02,850
Are you awake?

596
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:05,102
Give me a minute

597
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,585
Did I wake you?

598
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,143
Will you suck me off?

599
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,251
That felt so good

600
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:53,544
Thank you

601
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:59,091
You like the way it feels?

602
01:02:02,136 --> 01:02:03,178
Yes

603
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,307
It's my tooth

604
01:02:58,942 --> 01:03:00,569
You're awake?

605
01:03:00,736 --> 01:03:02,571
You're already up

606
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:07,326
- What's that?
- Do you like kimchi stew?

607
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,787
I've added some tuna to it

608
01:03:10,037 --> 01:03:13,207
My favorite dish!
How did you know?

609
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,875
Is that so?

610
01:03:17,169 --> 01:03:21,882
I don't remember

611
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:26,887
You're up?

612
01:03:30,766 --> 01:03:32,351
I'm making stew

613
01:03:35,395 --> 01:03:36,855
Give me some water

614
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:39,900
Are you hung over?

615
01:03:45,531 --> 01:03:46,949
Me too

616
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,377
ls this really you?

617
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:08,428
Mary, come and eat

618
01:04:34,746 --> 01:04:36,331
It's cold today

619
01:04:37,624 --> 01:04:39,334
It's warmer than yesterday

620
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,729
- Kick the ball
- Can you kick it?

621
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:05,110
Sir! What a surprise!

622
01:05:05,360 --> 01:05:08,196
- What are you doing?
- Playing soccer

623
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,865
What brings you here?

624
01:05:10,866 --> 01:05:13,785
They're all on the stands

625
01:05:14,369 --> 01:05:18,373
- What are you here for?
- I'm here with friends

626
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:20,375
- Are they my students?
- Yes

627
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:24,004
They've come for
my son's birthday

628
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,048
- They came with me
- ls that so?

629
01:05:26,381 --> 01:05:29,801
I have to go
Let's have a drink after

630
01:05:29,843 --> 01:05:31,803
Wait for us
They'll be pleased

631
01:05:32,638 --> 01:05:35,307
Quite a crowd

632
01:05:35,891 --> 01:05:37,100
Sungwoon, come on!

633
01:05:38,226 --> 01:05:40,187
Excuse me, I have to go

634
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:42,481
Wait for us
Go and say hello to them

635
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:43,482
All right

636
01:05:46,568 --> 01:05:48,654
- Are they your students?
- Yes

637
01:05:52,491 --> 01:05:54,952
I'm not coming to the spring

638
01:05:55,202 --> 01:05:56,620
Go ahead without me

639
01:05:57,788 --> 01:05:59,081
If you want

640
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:05,712
- You're staying?
- Yep

641
01:06:07,756 --> 01:06:10,592
We'll bring you back
some spring water

642
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:44,918
- Sir, put this on
- I don't need it

643
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:46,670
I pinched it for you

644
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:49,756
Why are you staying here, sir?
Go with them

645
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,551
Shall I send them over?

646
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:55,804
No, it's okay, I'm fine

647
01:06:56,138 --> 01:06:58,598
Go and play I'll see them later

648
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:00,142
Okay

649
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:38,138
- You took your time
- Why are you alone?

650
01:07:38,263 --> 01:07:40,098
Sir, you're very elegant

651
01:07:40,432 --> 01:07:42,851
I have to go
My friends are waiting

652
01:07:43,351 --> 01:07:47,689
- Having fun? Not too cold?
- I'm not cold, sir

653
01:07:47,773 --> 01:07:49,483
Sir, buy us a drink!

654
01:07:49,649 --> 01:07:53,236
- A drink? It's too early
- Come on!

655
01:07:53,361 --> 01:07:56,698
- Come and sit down
- All right

656
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,870
- Sir, sit here
- Thank You

657
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:15,217
- Thank you
- What brings you here?

658
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,762
- I had to come here yesterday
- What?

659
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,431
You saw my friends earlier?

660
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,724
No

661
01:08:23,683 --> 01:08:27,646
They wanted to return to their past

662
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,565
I helped them

663
01:08:31,483 --> 01:08:33,068
Do you have a problem?

664
01:08:33,360 --> 01:08:36,822
No, If you're here
everything's fine

665
01:08:39,699 --> 01:08:42,536
- Do I sound stupid?
- Not at all

666
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:46,540
You're the most intelligent person
I know

667
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,792
Really? You flatter me

668
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:52,546
- Sir, put this on
- Keep it

669
01:08:52,712 --> 01:08:54,923
I'm not cold

670
01:08:55,090 --> 01:08:56,800
For a second, then

671
01:09:05,517 --> 01:09:07,519
It smells nice

672
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,984
Very nice

673
01:09:19,114 --> 01:09:20,782
Really very nice

674
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:44,431
Sir, come on
they've already left

675
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:47,058
- ls it over?
- Yes

676
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:50,937
The cold made them hungry
They've left, forgive them

677
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,610
Kim Wook! What are you doing?
Our teacher's here

678
01:09:57,777 --> 01:10:02,240
Come with us
What about your friends?

679
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:06,494
I won't bother waiting
Are you eating now?

680
01:10:06,703 --> 01:10:08,663
Yes, to start with

681
01:10:09,414 --> 01:10:11,750
I'll come with you, then

682
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,252
- Hello
- Are you well?

683
01:10:14,419 --> 01:10:15,879
- Yeah
- Hi

684
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,380
Hello

685
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:51,998
We took too long
Isn't that his bottle?

686
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,918
He has left

687
01:10:57,337 --> 01:10:59,798
He must have been angry

688
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,717
Does he have a reason to wait?

689
01:11:04,261 --> 01:11:08,265
What's the matter with you?

690
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,476
Why are you being so mean?

691
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:17,399
I'm being mean?

692
01:11:20,277 --> 01:11:23,238
Okay, I'll go
See you later

693
01:11:23,321 --> 01:11:26,283
Hunjoon! Hunjoon!

694
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:32,580
Isn't that a bit easy?

695
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:40,672
It's not easy
You treated me badly

696
01:11:40,839 --> 01:11:43,633
I didn't sleep, not a wink!

697
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:52,517
- Hunjoon!
- Stop it!

698
01:12:01,735 --> 01:12:02,819
You should do that

699
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:08,616
- Can you read palms?
- When I drink, it happens

700
01:12:09,284 --> 01:12:11,119
A fortune-teller told me

701
01:12:11,286 --> 01:12:13,872
I had to obey men

702
01:12:14,789 --> 01:12:15,999
Really?

703
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:22,255
People read palms their own way

704
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,507
According to who they are
and the lines change...

705
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,718
Who hasn't answered?

706
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:28,762
Your turn, Kyunghee

707
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:34,768
Here's my question
It's always the same

708
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:40,607
The last time you had sex
when was that?

709
01:12:40,774 --> 01:12:43,610
Who with?
What was it like?

710
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:46,071
Always the same questions

711
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,323
- What?
- I'm not criticizing you

712
01:12:48,615 --> 01:12:53,828
- Ask something else
- Answer, now that I've asked

713
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,919
It was two days ago

714
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:04,506
I had been drinking

715
01:13:04,589 --> 01:13:08,510
He really seemed to want it
I followed him

716
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:13,681
I didn't feel much
The place was pretty filthy

717
01:13:13,765 --> 01:13:15,183
I envy him

718
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,562
Drink up and ask a question

719
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,564
You're being pretty coarse

720
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:27,987
So what are you?
You're not coarse?

721
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,992
You're classy?
What does that mean?

722
01:13:33,159 --> 01:13:36,246
I just wanted to say

723
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:39,833
that you're being coarse

724
01:13:39,916 --> 01:13:42,127
not that I'm classy

725
01:13:42,335 --> 01:13:46,673
What does classy mean?

726
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,716
I'm classy

727
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:51,761
Asshole!

728
01:13:53,096 --> 01:13:56,307
You think you're classy
with your borrowed ideas?

729
01:13:58,518 --> 01:14:02,772
Have you read a lot?

730
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,859
The books you've read
are the remains of the dead

731
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,195
They're their self-justification

732
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:11,364
Their self-promotion!

733
01:14:13,032 --> 01:14:14,617
At least know

734
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,787
what you're talking about!

735
01:14:17,829 --> 01:14:20,415
What do you know?
What do we know?

736
01:14:20,498 --> 01:14:22,333
What are we sure of?

737
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:26,504
Shit, why act so smart?

738
01:14:26,921 --> 01:14:29,883
Fucking admit you know nothing!

739
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:35,722
You think you're the only one
who thinks that?

740
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:37,015
What?

741
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:43,855
I'm not saying that

742
01:14:44,397 --> 01:14:47,609
How can you believe in nothing?

743
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:54,115
Believing in nothing
is nothing to be proud of!

744
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,912
Is there another way to be happy?

745
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,666
How do you think
we can be happy?

746
01:15:05,293 --> 01:15:09,005
Sir! Why are you so pompous

747
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:12,091
when girls are around?

748
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:19,307
I didn't mean to annoy you

749
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:23,019
but you have a problem

750
01:15:59,597 --> 01:16:00,932
Sir!

751
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:13,820
It's you! Why did you leave?

752
01:16:14,445 --> 01:16:16,155
It's over anyway

753
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:20,535
I thought you'd come this way
I was right

754
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:24,872
You've had a lot to drink

755
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:29,752
No, I want to have a drink
with you

756
01:16:29,961 --> 01:16:33,965
Now? More drinking?

757
01:16:34,132 --> 01:16:38,970
Just tonight I promise
I'd like that

758
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:45,935
What am I going to do with you?

759
01:16:50,148 --> 01:16:55,361
No, not like that
I like honesty

760
01:16:58,031 --> 01:17:00,658
You're an honest man

761
01:17:01,075 --> 01:17:05,788
Determined
I like that

762
01:17:10,460 --> 01:17:11,669
Are you coming?

763
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:24,932
Just tonight I promise

764
01:17:40,198 --> 01:17:41,741
That's a motel

765
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:44,661
Kyunghee!

766
01:17:47,914 --> 01:17:52,085
I want to go in there
What about you?

767
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,714
That suits me, sir

768
01:17:57,757 --> 01:17:58,841
Really?

769
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:01,678
Well then...

770
01:18:03,805 --> 01:18:05,014
Let's go

771
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,386
This isn't what I imagined

772
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,391
It's really tiny

773
01:18:56,149 --> 01:19:00,278
It's really filthy
You can't even sit down

774
01:19:04,907 --> 01:19:10,580
Sir, do you want me
to suck you off?

775
01:19:14,417 --> 01:19:15,877
Actually...

776
01:19:21,841 --> 01:19:24,677
I'll suck you off

777
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:24,589
No one's there, who was it?

778
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:30,428
I think it was him
I think it was Minsoo

779
01:21:31,846 --> 01:21:35,182
Minsoo?
Who's Minsoo?

780
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:39,186
The one who annoyed you earlier

781
01:21:41,230 --> 01:21:44,567
Him? His name's Minsoo?

782
01:21:46,027 --> 01:21:47,862
He came this far?

783
01:21:48,988 --> 01:21:53,701
When my phone rang
it was him

784
01:22:02,084 --> 01:22:03,878
Why did he do that?

785
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:10,259
That's the way he is
He's a shit-stirrer

786
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:16,057
Really?

787
01:22:17,141 --> 01:22:18,976
I think so, anyhow

788
01:22:20,269 --> 01:22:23,731
He's weird
always following me around

789
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:57,598
What do we do now?
It's a problem for you

790
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:04,772
If you see him
at university tomorrow

791
01:23:05,022 --> 01:23:07,858
Perhaps you'll find out more

792
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:14,365
He'll end up mentioning it
You'll let me know?

793
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:17,576
Of course
Only natural

794
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:24,917
If you don't see him tomorrow
and you call him

795
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:28,587
Do you think he'd find that odd?

796
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:31,007
Probably

797
01:23:31,173 --> 01:23:34,760
I never call him

798
01:23:35,553 --> 01:23:37,513
But don't worry

799
01:23:37,763 --> 01:23:41,475
I'll see him in class
tomorrow or the day after

800
01:23:42,518 --> 01:23:47,898
But what if he tells someone
before then?

801
01:23:48,691 --> 01:23:53,029
Would he do that
knowing that I'm involved?

802
01:23:55,406 --> 01:23:58,242
I think he'll talk to me first

803
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:00,536
What's his name again?

804
01:24:00,911 --> 01:24:04,498
Minsoo
He has attended your class

805
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,417
I don't remember

806
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,545
My memory's not very good

807
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,803
Here's a taxi I'll go first

808
01:24:21,599 --> 01:24:24,810
Go ahead
Take care

809
01:24:24,894 --> 01:24:26,395
Good-bye
