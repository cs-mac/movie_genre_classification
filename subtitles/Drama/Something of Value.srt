01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,716
[IN ENGLISH] Lathela, get some kerosene
and dry wood.

963
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:31,553
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.

964
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,233
I am the messenger of god.

965
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:34,515
Did god create Mau Mau?

966
01:20:34,680 --> 01:20:35,999
Mau Mau is the will of god.

967
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:39,072
Did god tell you
to mutilate innocent children?

968
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:42,232
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi
ever violate animals?

969
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,992
Since the creation of Mount Kenya...

970
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:47,038
...has god ever told you
to steal and murder and burn and hate?

971
01:20:47,200 --> 01:20:49,794
Is it the will of god that you eat
human flesh and blood?

972
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:51,518
- I swear that...
- Wait.

973
01:20:51,680 --> 01:20:54,513
Let your swearing have value
in the eyes of god.

974
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:57,911
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.

975
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,200
Hold this symbol of God
in your hands and swear.

976
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,510
Then I'll believe you.

977
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,117
Now begin at the beginning.

978
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,271
Did you ever take the
Mau Mau blood oath yourself?

979
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:10,793
- No.
- I believe you.

980
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,712
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.

981
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:13,869
- By force?
- Yes.

982
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:16,634
You swore to drive the white men
out of Africa, didn't you?

983
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:20,156
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?

984
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:26,072
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.

985
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:34,112
I've said enough.

986
01:21:34,280 --> 01:21:35,998
You are afraid to face your god.

987
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:38,994
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.

988
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,116
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.

989
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:42,395
How? What faith?

990
01:21:42,560 --> 01:21:44,357
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?

991
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,273
Will god take back the people
who've eaten the blood oath?

992
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,273
That's why you didn't take
the oath yourself, isn't it?

993
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:53,512
Because you wanted to be able
to come back to god.

994
01:21:57,400 --> 01:22:01,791
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful...

995
01:22:01,960 --> 01:22:03,757
...with no other gods before you.

996

HENRY:
But you've broken every law of your god.

997
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:07,354
Tell him that too.

998
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:10,398
Tell him you gave the blood oath
to others by night, by force.

999
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,711
That you gave it before witnesses,
gave it to women and children.

1000
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:15,757
These are the worst violations.

1001
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:18,878
How can you lead your people
back to god?

1002
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:24,314
Even tonight, more of your people
are being oathed...

1003
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:26,232
...banished from the house of god...

1004
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:29,790
...cursed to live through eternity
as a broken-spined hyena.

1005
01:22:29,960 --> 01:22:32,030
Is that the future for your people?

1006
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,078
Is it? Is that what you want?

1007

No.

1008

Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?

1009
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,748
Who is he?

1010
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:45,994
If god cannot accept Mau Mau,
Mau Mau cannot lead your people.

1011
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,709
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.

Come back with me.

1278
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:09,872
No.

1279
01:47:11,520 --> 01:47:13,192
We'll start over again.

1280
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:15,032
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.

1281
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:16,994
It is too late.

1282
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,116
For you and me.

1283
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:20,713
It is too late.

1284
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,194
Must I kill you?

1285
01:47:27,520 --> 01:47:29,238
Yes.

1286
01:47:45,560 --> 01:47:47,676
[YELLS]

1287
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,119
Give me the child and bury us both.

1288
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:09,315
No.

1289
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:11,797
Please.

1290
01:48:19,680 --> 01:48:21,318
He is dead.

1291
01:48:36,840 --> 01:48:39,400
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.

1292
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,074
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.

1293
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:44,949
Maybe for them, it'll be better.

1294
01:48:45,720 --> 01:48:47,358
It's not too late.
