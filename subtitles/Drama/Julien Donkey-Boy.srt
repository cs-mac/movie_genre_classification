1
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,997
Come on.

2
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,034
Babes?

3
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,396
Let me in. I'll help you.

4
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,034
Open up, Tams.

5
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:17,358
- St Tropez in here?
- Shit.

6
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:18,707
You all right?

7
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:22,989
Come on, you're gorgeous.
I'm a bit of a mess.

8
00:02:23,119 --> 00:02:25,792
I swear, you're gonna love this place.
Trust me.

9
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,557
I reckon Ibiza
woulda been better.

10
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,115
Don't wear that. It's not really
my colour. It'll look great on you.

11
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,231
You'll look gorgeous.

12
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,230
Where's my phone?

13
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:38,590
Ryan? Fucking twat.

14
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,155
- Here, pass it.
- Why doesn't he just leave you alone?

15
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,035
- Kim, you wouldn't dare...
- He's toxic, babe.

16
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:56,270
I don't believe you.

17
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,198
You promised.
No more contact.

18
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,915
Here's to Tammi, for being brave.

19
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,191
- And a wicked girlie weekend together.
- Three of us.

20
00:03:06,321 --> 00:03:07,913
Three of us.

21
00:03:08,361 --> 00:03:09,998
Cheers!

22
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:24,153
I can't believe we're here finally...

23
00:03:55,598 --> 00:03:57,555
This is gonna be so cool.

24
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,510
- Right, what's everyone drinking?
- Champagne.

25
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,469
Champagne. Right.

26
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,431
- You don't have to...
- Might as well buy a bottle, right?

27
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:12,312
- Bring it on, my good man.
- Don't posh boys drink this all the time?

28
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,431
I have it on my cornflakes.
I'm Marcus by the way.

29
00:05:15,558 --> 00:05:17,230
- Kim.
- Pleased to meet you.

30
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:19,076
Pleased to meet you.

31
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,553
Just do one thing for me?

32
00:05:26,238 --> 00:05:27,307
Please.

33
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:30,351
- What?
- Game on.

34
00:05:43,078 --> 00:05:45,228
Excuse me.
He wants his drink back.

35
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:48,111
Oh, shit, man! Let's...

36
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:11,632
- Come on, ladies.
- Are we going now?

37
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:14,754
So, all right...

38
00:06:16,638 --> 00:06:18,117
Ptchaa!

39
00:06:18,198 --> 00:06:19,916
- Fuck off.
- What?

40
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:21,596
- That's shit.
- It's not, it's good.

41
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:24,994
Is that supposed to be a trick?
Like, you're some sort of a magician?

42
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,552
It's not a trick, my dear.
It's an illusion.

43
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:39,357
Can you believe that yesterday
we was in Leeds in the sodding rain?

44
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:42,073
- And now we're here.
- I know, babe.

45
00:06:43,238 --> 00:06:47,151
- I told you we'd look after you.
- We'll see yet.

46
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:53,475
What now, ladies?
Hit another bar or something?

47
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:56,191
Can't we get a bottle of wine
and drink it here?

48
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:59,549
You're welcome to come back
to the yacht and have a drink with us.

49
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:01,315
Yeah.

50
00:07:01,437 --> 00:07:04,794
Right. You were nicking drinks,
but you've got a yacht?

51
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:08,115
We just wanted you to like us
for who we really are.

52
00:07:09,318 --> 00:07:12,515
- You do not have a boat.
- Kim, they do.

53
00:07:12,638 --> 00:07:14,947
I saw a dinghy parked over there!

54
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:18,876
- Daddy's boat!
- Course it is.

55
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:21,558
No, we're crew.
You know those boats in the marina?

56
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:24,875
- We crew one of those.
- You're sailors?

57
00:07:24,998 --> 00:07:26,988
We just came back off
a three-month stint.

58
00:07:27,118 --> 00:07:29,187
The owner flew out yesterday,
as did the skipper.

59
00:07:29,277 --> 00:07:32,508
- And left you in charge?
- Absolutely. I'm the second mate.

60
00:07:32,637 --> 00:07:35,198
- Josh here's the deckie.
- Skivvy, more like.

61
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:38,115
Well, what are you, then?
The onboard hairdresser?

62
00:07:38,237 --> 00:07:40,147
International playboy.

63
00:07:40,277 --> 00:07:43,074
Just flew in from 'biza to check out
my old mucker, the 'coose.

64
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:45,188
Look, the new crew arrive on Monday.

65
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:48,468
This is our last weekend together.
What do you say?

66
00:07:57,357 --> 00:07:59,188
Lead the way.

67
00:08:05,237 --> 00:08:07,671
- Here?
- Yeah, sure.

68
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,154
Ladies first. Then fellas.

69
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:34,189
It's just up here on the right.

70
00:08:34,317 --> 00:08:37,229
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, easy...

71
00:08:39,717 --> 00:08:42,389
- How about this?
- Relax. It's going according to plan.

72
00:08:42,516 --> 00:08:45,031
Wicked.
Right, you ready?

73
00:08:47,997 --> 00:08:49,554
Is everyone ready?

74
00:08:50,116 --> 00:08:52,107
You guys ready?
Yeah.

75
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:54,910
You lot.
I think we should go back.

76
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,551
- You what?
- No offence, but...

77
00:08:57,677 --> 00:09:01,556
I thought it was just like
a girlie weekend, like the three of us.

78
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:06,273
Babe, if you want to chill at the beach,
then, we can catch up later, yeah?

79
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:14,027
Come on, Tam. Don't be mardy, yeah?
We'll just go for one drink.

80
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:16,465
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
I'm just...

81
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,594
This lot are a laugh.

82
00:09:20,717 --> 00:09:25,550
Ladies and gentlemen, please
allow me to introduce to you the boat.

83
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:29,146
Seventy-six feet of pure luxury
motor yacht and may I say...

84
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,153
- Sean! Let us on!
- Oi, Sean! Oi, Sean!

85
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,595
Hey.

86
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:41,990
- Come on, Tam.
- Mmm, all right. One drink.

87
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,675
Wicked.

88
00:09:45,676 --> 00:09:48,430
- I'm Kim, nice to meet you.
- Sean. Nice to meet you.

89
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:50,433
- All right, mate.
- All right, Blue.

90
00:09:52,317 --> 00:09:55,514
- This is Sean, our engineer.
- Lisa.

91
00:09:57,677 --> 00:09:59,348
- Tammi.
- Sean.

92
00:09:59,477 --> 00:10:00,990
Nice one.

93
00:10:04,717 --> 00:10:09,393
- So... you're Josh's brother?
- For my sins, yeah.

94
00:10:09,517 --> 00:10:11,394
- He been misbehaving?
- A little.

95
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:13,235
No, bless him.
He's a right sweetheart.

96
00:10:13,317 --> 00:10:15,547
- Kim, check it out.
- What?

97
00:10:15,676 --> 00:10:17,507
What is it?

98
00:10:17,636 --> 00:10:20,788
Marcus and Bluey, man, unstoppable.
We're so on it.

99
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,112
We? Right, what am I supposed
to be doing?

100
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:25,112
I don't know. Serve drinks?

101
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,107
- What do you think then, eh?
- Hmm, yeah.

102
00:10:29,236 --> 00:10:31,306
- Impressive, or?
- It's not bad.

103
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:35,429
- You been on a boat before?
- Yeah. Ferry to Ireland.

104
00:10:35,556 --> 00:10:39,674
I think this is a bit bigger.
You gonna give us a tour, then?

105
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:44,308
All right, yeah. Come on, then.

106
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:48,032
- Come on.
- Check it out. It's like the Tardis.

107
00:10:50,716 --> 00:10:52,354
Oh, my gosh.

108
00:11:00,355 --> 00:11:02,950
This is the stateroom.
The owner's bedroom.

109
00:11:03,076 --> 00:11:05,465
Bloody heck.
This is bigger than my flat.

110
00:11:06,955 --> 00:11:08,308
It's all right this, isn't it?

111
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,907
- Come on.
- Come on.

112
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:26,427
This is the master guest room.
For VIPs.

113
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:30,795
That will be us, then.

114
00:11:30,915 --> 00:11:33,032
Come on. Show us the rest.

115
00:11:43,676 --> 00:11:46,031
All right!

116
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:52,070
Check out these beauties.
They crank out 1,000 horsepower each.

117
00:11:52,196 --> 00:11:55,029
OK...

118
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:59,186
Shoulda seen your brother, man.
He rounded them kittens up.

119
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:03,911
- Yeah, I'm very proud. Marcus...
- Shame he didn't bring one for you.

120
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:08,348
- Three into four don't go.
- Think I'll have to sit this one out, eh?

121
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:11,353
Suit yourself.
I'm on Kim like butter on toast.

122
00:12:11,474 --> 00:12:13,909
Marcus has that other one.

123
00:12:14,035 --> 00:12:16,071
- Lisa.
- Yeah, Lisa.

124
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:18,026
Funbags fitted as standard.

125
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,827
Funbags?

126
00:12:19,955 --> 00:12:23,106
That leaves you and little Josh
fighting for bronze.

127
00:12:23,235 --> 00:12:26,193
Get in there.
That Tammi's a peach.

128
00:12:26,315 --> 00:12:28,909
Nah. Josh is after her. It's fine.

129
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:32,949
Real, man. You gonna let
your kid brother chew your grass?

130
00:12:35,076 --> 00:12:36,953
I don't even know what that means.

131
00:12:37,075 --> 00:12:40,386
He's been learning skills, mate.
Skills at the hands of the Bluemaster.

132
00:12:40,515 --> 00:12:43,314
Oh, really?
So he knows how to talk shit now?

133
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:45,233
Mate, he's going to law school.

134
00:12:47,354 --> 00:12:50,233
Euuurgh. It smells of boy!

135
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,504
- Is this where you stay?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:54,634 --> 00:12:56,989
- What, the three of you?
- Yeah.

137
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:58,467
Very cosy.

138
00:13:00,675 --> 00:13:02,551
Hope you've been careful.

139
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:04,551
Ooh!

140
00:13:04,674 --> 00:13:06,346
- Wicked.
- Babe.

141
00:13:07,634 --> 00:13:09,546
Let's 'ave it.

142
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:23,673
Easy-peasy.
Just have to count to four, all right?

143
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:28,151
- Here we go!
- Just slip it in.

144
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:38,347
Oi, guys, guys, guys. I'm sorry
but you cannot pump the music like that.

145
00:13:38,476 --> 00:13:40,114
Don't cock-block me, boss.

146
00:13:40,235 --> 00:13:44,115
Mate, if one of the other skippers hears,
we're on the next flight home.

147
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:46,112
Blues, he's right. Be subtle about it.

148
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:50,114
Oh, man.
You leave your balls in Customs?

149
00:13:50,234 --> 00:13:52,544
- Erm, is there a problem?
- Don't worry.

150
00:13:52,675 --> 00:13:55,314
We'll be back on the road shortly, OK?

151
00:13:56,275 --> 00:14:00,950
- Nice meeting you, but gotta go...
- Guys, guys. Look relax, yeah?

152
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:04,306
New plan, all right? Fuck the marina.
We party on the high seas.

153
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,948
That's really not a good idea.
Don't worry about it.

154
00:14:07,034 --> 00:14:09,993
Drinking fine champagne,
watching the sunset over the Med?

155
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,070
- Can't do that in no club.
- Marcus...

156
00:14:12,195 --> 00:14:14,503
Anyone says anything, we'll say
we're emptying the bilge tanks.

157
00:14:14,635 --> 00:14:17,546
Sounds like a plan.
Come on, Sean.

158
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,945
Fine.

159
00:14:24,594 --> 00:14:26,346
Game on!

160
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,987
Wicked!

161
00:14:58,354 --> 00:14:59,912
You want a go?

162
00:15:00,034 --> 00:15:03,424
- Don't know how to do it.
- It's easy. Just unwind it. Here you go.

163
00:15:03,554 --> 00:15:06,307
You keep holding it, then.

164
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:11,663
- Now just throw it over there.
- Oh, I can't do that. I can't.

165
00:15:13,714 --> 00:15:15,194
You can do it.

166
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:10,552
Did someone say they were seasick?
Cos I've got a very special cure.

167
00:16:10,674 --> 00:16:15,111
- E's on the house!
- Yeah, but are they dud?

168
00:16:15,234 --> 00:16:18,112
It's not the drugs you wanna
worry about. It's Bluey on the drugs.

169
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,951
I'm 100% dependable, mate.

170
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:23,145
- I'm a fucking Volvo, mate.
- Promise? We've got guests.

171
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,629
These are the shiznits, baby.
Give you a nice lickle tingle.

172
00:16:27,312 --> 00:16:28,665
Give us one, then.

173
00:16:43,233 --> 00:16:46,066
- Joshie?
- Know what, Blue, I'm fine. I'm good.

174
00:16:46,193 --> 00:16:48,104
Josh, mate...

175
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:51,270
Mate, mate, mate, mate,
mate, mate, mate, mate...

176
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:55,349
Don't take that one! Ha!

177
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:58,546
- Do you just want to do half of that?
- Is that all right?

178
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:02,311
I cracked a nail!

179
00:17:27,553 --> 00:17:30,191
This... is what it's all about.

180
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:32,031
Whoo!

181
00:17:35,193 --> 00:17:38,185
- What's it like?
- 8.7!

182
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:41,345
- Oi!
- Aim lower!

183
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:43,270
Leave him alone!

184
00:17:44,993 --> 00:17:47,302
It's a clay pigeon.
Marcus is teaching the owner to shoot.

185
00:17:48,673 --> 00:17:50,583
Show us your gun, then.

186
00:17:50,713 --> 00:17:53,432
Please. We hardly even
know each other.

187
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,307
Whoo!

188
00:17:57,514 --> 00:17:59,185
10.0!

189
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:01,907
He's joined the Marines.
He's gonna be a lieutenant.

190
00:18:02,034 --> 00:18:04,103
- Really?
- Really.

191
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:12,347
Oh, my God, I'm so happy.

192
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:17,262
Come on in. It's perfect.

193
00:18:19,032 --> 00:18:22,024
- What?
- I've never been out to sea like this.

194
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,551
What?

195
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:26,549
- You can swim?
- Yeah.

196
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:32,901
Come on.

197
00:18:33,032 --> 00:18:34,943
You lot, I swear...

198
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:39,986
- Wait for the E to hit, it'll be amazing.
- Better bloody be.

199
00:18:40,113 --> 00:18:42,023
Ah! Friggin' heck!

200
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:52,983
- Come on, Blue, in you get.
- Come on, Blue! Get in here!

201
00:18:55,673 --> 00:18:57,709
Kim, you gonna go clubbing
when we're back?

202
00:18:57,993 --> 00:19:00,985
Yeah. Pasha. Do you want to come?

203
00:19:01,993 --> 00:19:02,949
What?

204
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:05,985
Nothing. A mate who DJs there
told me the maddest story...

205
00:19:06,113 --> 00:19:08,182
- Ah, who?
- Not saying.

206
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,509
But you'd know him, whatever
this geezer I'm talking about.

207
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,225
Tell us.

208
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:16,070
- I don't know. It's a bit full on.
- Go on. Tell us.

209
00:19:16,192 --> 00:19:18,467
Oh... All right.

210
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:23,908
- He got tarmac'd.
- Tarmac'd?

211
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:28,389
It's well grubby. He pulled
this goth bird after a set, right?

212
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:31,072
Goes back to her place.
So she's on top, yeah?

213
00:19:31,192 --> 00:19:33,342
All of a sudden,
she sits up on his chest...

214
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:36,544
- Blues, abort now. Seriously.
- No man. You gotta hear it!

215
00:19:36,672 --> 00:19:41,109
She drops her load right on him.
Which is bad enough, right?

216
00:19:41,232 --> 00:19:46,067
But then she rolls her butt up and down
like a steamroller. Tarmac'd.

217
00:19:47,472 --> 00:19:51,146
That is fuck all.
Ain't you lot heard of a "Dirty Sanchez"?

218
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:53,023
Yeah!

219
00:19:53,152 --> 00:19:57,144
Oh, my God. Turkey slapping?
You know what it is, right?

220
00:19:57,232 --> 00:19:59,506
You take your dick,
and slap it round a girl's face.

221
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,622
Or a boy's!

222
00:20:01,711 --> 00:20:03,986
You need a bit of length
to get a good swing on it.

223
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:06,221
Rules little Josh out, then.

224
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:15,266
- Anyone heard of a Donkey Punch?
- Yeah, man, sweet.

225
00:20:17,551 --> 00:20:20,908
- Oh, you know it do you?
- Know it? I've done it.

226
00:20:21,031 --> 00:20:23,465
OK, genius. Tell us.

227
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:29,150
Nah, man. You know, ladies present.

228
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:36,863
Basically, right, you're taking
a loved one from behind,

229
00:20:36,992 --> 00:20:38,664
and just when you're about
to blow your load...

230
00:20:40,312 --> 00:20:44,100
...back of the neck,
involuntary muscle spasm.

231
00:20:45,232 --> 00:20:47,587
Ooh, man.

232
00:20:48,432 --> 00:20:51,504
The clench?
You've never felt anything like it, mate.

233
00:20:53,031 --> 00:20:56,228
- Still reckon you've done it?
- Fuck off.

234
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,109
What's in it for the girl?

235
00:21:06,311 --> 00:21:10,020
- Don't understand the question.
- You're a wrong 'un.

236
00:21:12,591 --> 00:21:14,183
The sky's incredible.

237
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,586
I love it out here.

238
00:21:17,711 --> 00:21:20,669
- So, do you want to go back to Leeds?
- Not really.

239
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:24,909
There's too many people
I don't want to see any more.

240
00:21:25,032 --> 00:21:26,987
So why stay? Make a leap.

241
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:29,342
- What?
- Oh, wait, come here.

242
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,191
- What are you doing?
- Back flip.

243
00:21:32,312 --> 00:21:33,711
You idiot.

244
00:21:53,671 --> 00:21:55,342
What's that?

245
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:59,860
Russian Ice, man. Huge in 'biza.

246
00:21:59,991 --> 00:22:03,187
But the doctor recommends
just a baby hit.

247
00:22:03,311 --> 00:22:05,188
It's proper hardcore.

248
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,467
I am hardcore.

249
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:29,908
Ooh, ooh.

250
00:22:31,912 --> 00:22:34,061
Ah, it makes your chest go all cold.

251
00:22:34,191 --> 00:22:35,624
Go on, then.

252
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,061
Come on, little Josh, suck it down.
Yeah, baby.

253
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,429
You're funny, man.

254
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:58,228
Why don't we take this downstairs, huh?

255
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,345
I'll take you...

256
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:01,467
Don't worry.
He won't do anything unless he's told.

257
00:25:29,469 --> 00:25:31,983
Oh, yeah.

258
00:25:39,709 --> 00:25:42,542
Pretty ladies, come to Bluey...

259
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:47,221
Naughty. Gimme.

260
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,063
OK, now you two.

261
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,427
Why not? You went to public school,
didn't you?

262
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:07,462
Shit, I got kicked out for being straight.

263
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:26,060
Who's got the best butt?

264
00:26:29,068 --> 00:26:31,218
Ooh. It's not bad.

265
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,020
Now the other one.

266
00:26:40,989 --> 00:26:42,263
Nice and firm.

267
00:26:46,509 --> 00:26:48,022
Oi!

268
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:53,825
I was seeing someone
before we left, but it ended.

269
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:57,021
- Badly?
- She messed me about.

270
00:26:59,468 --> 00:27:00,981
What about you?

271
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:04,986
Yeah, I was with someone
but people grow apart, don't they?

272
00:27:10,948 --> 00:27:13,940
In fact, that's bollocks.

273
00:27:14,068 --> 00:27:16,946
I caught him cheating
with a really old friend of mine.

274
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:18,387
That's horrible.

275
00:27:18,508 --> 00:27:20,624
I felt like such a fucking idiot
for not realising...

276
00:27:20,708 --> 00:27:23,700
No. He's the fucking idiot.

277
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:26,342
Wait a minute.

278
00:27:44,669 --> 00:27:46,899
Them lot have all gone.

279
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,665
- Josh, too?
- All of 'em.

280
00:27:53,309 --> 00:27:55,504
Leave him. He'll be all right.

281
00:29:49,028 --> 00:29:51,303
Oi, mate, make yourself useful.

282
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:07,027
Back up, back up.
Get us all in, man.

283
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:33,664
Slow... slow down...
better not come yet.

284
00:30:36,267 --> 00:30:39,064
How about my boy here gets involved?

285
00:30:46,066 --> 00:30:47,545
Oi, mate.

286
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:50,938
Come here.

287
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:03,704
You're up, bro. Break off a piece.

288
00:32:51,226 --> 00:32:54,059
'Harder, mate.
Harder. Fucking pound her.

289
00:32:55,026 --> 00:32:56,664
'She loves it.

290
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:01,178
'Oi, mate, slap her arse.

291
00:33:01,307 --> 00:33:02,625
'She loves it.

292
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:07,301
'She loves it.

293
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,979
- 'Gonna come? '
- 'Yeah. Yeah.'

294
00:33:12,106 --> 00:33:15,497
- 'You know what to do, yeah? '
- 'Yeah. Oh, fuck! '

295
00:33:17,306 --> 00:33:19,661
'Do it. Do it.'

296
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:23,097
- Do it!
- Ah!

297
00:33:30,985 --> 00:33:32,544
Lisa? Lisa?

298
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:34,304
Lisa? Lisa?

299
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:44,141
Did you get it over here?

300
00:33:44,626 --> 00:33:47,220
Sean? W... will you come
downstairs please?

301
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:17,224
- Wish I could fucking find it.
- Let me.

302
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:29,221
- Mate, I think she's dead.
- Oh, God... Lisa!

303
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:34,538
- Lise!
- No, Lise... Lisa.

304
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,224
What happened?

305
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:45,984
We were just...

306
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:59,100
She must have OD-ed.

307
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,540
Look, I'm calling it in.

308
00:35:02,666 --> 00:35:05,225
- The coastguard can pick us up...
- Look, don't...

309
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:07,939
- Kim, come on.
- Don't.

310
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:09,703
Just... she's...

311
00:35:10,346 --> 00:35:14,940
Th... they're not going to get here...
By the time they're here, we'll be gone.

312
00:35:15,064 --> 00:35:16,861
There's no point.

313
00:36:04,703 --> 00:36:08,697
We've just got to keep it together
and we'll be back, OK?

314
00:36:28,944 --> 00:36:30,856
What the fuck, man?

315
00:36:30,984 --> 00:36:34,341
- What have you done?
- Me? I haven't done anything.

316
00:36:37,184 --> 00:36:39,415
Mate. I saw you.

317
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:42,184
Wh... what the fuck?

318
00:36:42,305 --> 00:36:44,773
What did you do?

319
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:47,466
This fucking mong donkey-punched her.

320
00:36:48,665 --> 00:36:50,143
No...

321
00:36:51,104 --> 00:36:54,063
Sh... she OD-ed or she...
had an allergic reaction.

322
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:56,335
To what, my cock?

323
00:36:58,344 --> 00:37:00,460
He donkey-punched her. For real.

324
00:37:02,103 --> 00:37:03,423
I thought...

325
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,534
- You said...
- I didn't say shit, mate!

326
00:37:07,664 --> 00:37:09,574
It was a joke, you dick.

327
00:37:09,704 --> 00:37:14,459
A story. No one fucking does it,
you stupid fucking cunt.

328
00:37:17,465 --> 00:37:21,094
- This is not fucking happening.
- No?

329
00:37:24,345 --> 00:37:26,176
Check the replay.

330
00:37:30,144 --> 00:37:31,464
I just...

331
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:37,295
Bluey and Josh...

332
00:37:39,024 --> 00:37:40,696
...acting weird.

333
00:37:44,463 --> 00:37:46,101
Weird?

334
00:37:48,463 --> 00:37:50,658
How do you mean weird?

335
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:58,893
They were shouting and...

336
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:01,942
...filming.

337
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:06,139
Bluey had a camera.

338
00:38:14,423 --> 00:38:17,143
'Do it! '

339
00:38:27,184 --> 00:38:28,981
We are in so much shit.

340
00:38:46,462 --> 00:38:48,454
Did you call it in?

341
00:38:56,223 --> 00:38:58,896
Your brother has something
he needs to tell you.

342
00:39:02,663 --> 00:39:04,142
I erm...

343
00:39:06,664 --> 00:39:08,619
I... I didn't mean to...

344
00:39:14,224 --> 00:39:16,943
It's all right, babe, we're almost home.

345
00:39:19,902 --> 00:39:21,700
Lisa OD-ed, babe.

346
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:25,214
It were an accident.

347
00:39:27,183 --> 00:39:28,934
It weren't.

348
00:39:34,942 --> 00:39:36,216
You have to help me.

349
00:39:38,222 --> 00:39:39,621
Please.

350
00:39:40,942 --> 00:39:43,411
What the fuck are you doing?

351
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:49,022
We're all going down for this.
For a long time.

352
00:39:49,143 --> 00:39:51,134
- We just explain...
- Explain?

353
00:39:51,262 --> 00:39:54,335
There's a girl downstairs with a broken
neck, and our DNA's all over her!

354
00:39:54,463 --> 00:39:56,454
Doesn't look good.

355
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:00,813
The best thing for all of us,

356
00:40:00,943 --> 00:40:03,935
and especially your fucking stupid
prick of a brother, is if...

357
00:40:04,063 --> 00:40:06,452
We could say she fell overboard.

358
00:40:09,183 --> 00:40:11,219
No body. No case.

359
00:40:23,423 --> 00:40:24,856
What the fuck's going on?

360
00:40:24,982 --> 00:40:27,133
It's all right.
I'm calling the police back home.

361
00:40:28,623 --> 00:40:30,420
- 'Emergency response... '
- Shit!

362
00:40:30,543 --> 00:40:33,579
What are we telling them?
What the fuck is going on?

363
00:40:38,582 --> 00:40:40,300
Can you hear me?

364
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:47,421
Listen to me!

365
00:40:57,903 --> 00:40:59,176
I know it sounds callous...

366
00:40:59,303 --> 00:41:01,100
The girls'll never agree to this.

367
00:41:01,223 --> 00:41:03,531
Girls? Are you gay? They're lucky
we don't dump them, too.

368
00:41:03,663 --> 00:41:06,222
Fuck is your problem?
It's your fault we're in this mess!

369
00:41:06,302 --> 00:41:10,056
I'm the bad guy? I didn't snap
a girl's neck like a fucking twig.

370
00:41:10,182 --> 00:41:13,891
You gave him the drugs, you fed him
those fucking fairy stories!

371
00:41:14,022 --> 00:41:16,330
He's a big boy.
Didn't do anything he didn't want to.

372
00:41:16,461 --> 00:41:20,659
Shut up. Shut your face.
Don't push your luck.

373
00:41:25,302 --> 00:41:29,090
You're going to chuck that tape
and keep your mouth shut. All right?

374
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:32,259
All right, then. I'll get it.

375
00:41:39,302 --> 00:41:41,611
- Throw the fucking thing!
- Bluey!

376
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:58,897
What about when we get back?
They'll just go straight to the police.

377
00:41:59,023 --> 00:42:02,059
And say what?
"We were E'ed up, fucking these lads,

378
00:42:02,183 --> 00:42:04,093
"but it weren't our fault."

379
00:42:04,223 --> 00:42:08,420
We don't need their consent.
Not anymore.

380
00:42:10,422 --> 00:42:12,538
Someone needs to tell them.

381
00:42:19,221 --> 00:42:22,179
Why aren't we going home?
We are.

382
00:42:22,301 --> 00:42:24,940
- I'm not an idiot.
- Sit down.

383
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:35,855
Look, a really shit thing has happened
and everything's fucked.

384
00:42:35,982 --> 00:42:40,020
Now, it's in everyone's best interests
that we do the right thing.

385
00:42:41,261 --> 00:42:42,820
The right thing?

386
00:42:42,942 --> 00:42:47,060
We just feel, like,
the best thing would be if we...

387
00:42:51,622 --> 00:42:54,182
...bury Lisa at sea. Here. Now.

388
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,219
Why would you do that?

389
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:04,459
Because as far as the coastguard's
concerned, Lisa fell overboard.

390
00:43:06,221 --> 00:43:08,336
You're all fucking mental.

391
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,573
Look, how long
have you actually known Lisa?

392
00:43:13,701 --> 00:43:16,898
Do you want to be the one
who has to tell her parents

393
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,330
exactly what she was doing
when she died?

394
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:33,134
Look, I'm acting skipper of this ship.
I just want what's best for everyone.

395
00:43:34,021 --> 00:43:35,977
We bury Lisa at sea.

396
00:43:36,942 --> 00:43:39,376
We call it in,
when the coastguard comes,

397
00:43:39,501 --> 00:43:43,414
we tell them she had too much to drink
and fell overboard. It happens.

398
00:43:43,542 --> 00:43:45,533
But she didn't, did she?

399
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:51,652
You killed her. It's on that tape.

400
00:43:53,142 --> 00:43:54,972
What tape?

401
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:58,899
Sean, you better tell them they can't.

402
00:43:59,021 --> 00:44:01,490
Tell them. It's wrong.

403
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,578
- When they find the body, what then?
- They're not going to find the body.

404
00:44:13,661 --> 00:44:17,290
The decision's been made.
This will all be over, very soon.

405
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:01,212
Marcus?

406
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:10,295
We have to be in International Waters
before we do this.

407
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,139
This ship is registered in Panama,

408
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:17,889
so once we're over that line
in International Waters,

409
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:19,976
we're under Panamanian law.

410
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:26,414
If it ever went to court...
we'd be in Panama.

411
00:45:26,541 --> 00:45:28,771
Shut up, Josh!

412
00:45:28,901 --> 00:45:33,292
It's the most corrupt place on earth.
There's no way they'd convict.

413
00:45:33,421 --> 00:45:36,413
We do it now.
We call it in after we cross the line.

414
00:45:36,541 --> 00:45:39,772
- I just... you know... Sorry.
- We need to do this now.

415
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:42,016
While those girls are still scared.

416
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,292
All right, Kim.

417
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,493
No, please. Please, no...

418
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,049
Don't you dare touch her.

419
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:21,132
Don't you dare fucking touch her!

420
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,251
Now why don't you sit down?

421
00:46:26,179 --> 00:46:28,489
I'm not asking. Sit.

422
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,136
I'm not your dog.

423
00:46:37,499 --> 00:46:39,137
Good girl.

424
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,489
Josh, go and stop the boat.

425
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,331
Now!

426
00:47:15,060 --> 00:47:17,494
Sean, get the anchor out of the RIB.

427
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:21,169
If we don't weigh her down,
she'll be ashore before we are.

428
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,936
This is not right.

429
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:40,930
Look. I've worked too fucking hard
to let your brother fuck it all up.

430
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,529
This way,
everyone gets their lives back.

431
00:47:47,379 --> 00:47:48,732
Not everyone.

432
00:48:15,499 --> 00:48:17,251
Oi!

433
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:22,409
- Get off!
- You killed her!

434
00:48:22,538 --> 00:48:25,371
- That's what I'll say when we get out!
- Yeah? Go tell the police.

435
00:48:25,498 --> 00:48:27,296
Tell them about the drugs
you were taking,

436
00:48:27,378 --> 00:48:29,653
how you were fucking a stranger
when your friend died.

437
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:30,932
Shut up!

438
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:33,971
Cos you've got no tape, no body,
no proof of anything.

439
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:35,736
It's your word against ours.

440
00:48:40,099 --> 00:48:42,851
Right! Tie them up!

441
00:48:42,979 --> 00:48:44,571
Fuck you!

442
00:49:04,219 --> 00:49:05,494
Leave her!

443
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:09,731
Go on. You fuckers,
I swear to God I'll cut you!

444
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,054
So you're going to cut me, yeah?

445
00:49:22,938 --> 00:49:26,487
Bluey, hold her.
Fucksake, Sean, let's just do it now!

446
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,454
No! No!

447
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,488
Fucking bastards!

448
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:39,129
- Do you want to join her?
- Do you want to fucking join her?

449
00:49:39,259 --> 00:49:41,693
How would you fucking like it?

450
00:49:52,059 --> 00:49:53,333
Fuck!

451
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:21,973
- Marcus!
- Go in there and find him!

452
00:50:22,098 --> 00:50:24,487
- Quick.
- Where the fuck is he?

453
00:50:27,618 --> 00:50:29,687
Marcus!

454
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:47,735
Oh, fuck! How do you?

455
00:50:54,059 --> 00:50:55,208
Whoa!

456
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,574
Don't you fucking touch her!

457
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:09,967
Josh, get back here and help me!

458
00:51:28,937 --> 00:51:32,692
- Fucking trying to kill me!
- The girls moved the boat.

459
00:51:34,338 --> 00:51:36,215
I almost got through.

460
00:51:36,338 --> 00:51:38,568
Fuck that. There's a gun here.
We've got to find it.

461
00:51:38,698 --> 00:51:42,737
No, we need to get flares or something.
Someone's got to be able to help us.

462
00:51:49,577 --> 00:51:51,329
Kim!

463
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:04,206
Where the fuck are those girls?

464
00:52:04,337 --> 00:52:06,214
Downstairs.

465
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:09,252
Why? What are you going to do?

466
00:52:12,097 --> 00:52:14,487
I'm going to go and have a hot shower.

467
00:52:15,497 --> 00:52:18,455
You want to check whether that's OK
with our guests?

468
00:53:01,737 --> 00:53:04,045
So you want to shoot me now?

469
00:53:25,297 --> 00:53:26,730
We found Marcus.

470
00:53:29,057 --> 00:53:30,933
Dead?

471
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:34,651
'Fraid not.
Here. Come on. It's freezing.

472
00:53:50,096 --> 00:53:52,610
All this crazy shit is not helping.

473
00:53:53,576 --> 00:53:57,091
- And what you're doing is really helpful?
- Look, you and me...

474
00:53:57,216 --> 00:53:59,366
We're the only ones
with our heads screwed on.

475
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:02,215
You helped them throw Lisa!

476
00:54:02,336 --> 00:54:05,294
You helped them throw her
like she were a...

477
00:54:09,336 --> 00:54:11,248
Look, I just need...

478
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:15,495
...just need you
to keep Kim under control.

479
00:54:28,617 --> 00:54:30,573
Fuck, man.

480
00:54:32,976 --> 00:54:34,251
Marcus...

481
00:54:36,217 --> 00:54:38,047
Thought we'd lost him.

482
00:54:40,376 --> 00:54:43,128
Got to look out for each other.

483
00:54:43,255 --> 00:54:44,608
Yes.

484
00:54:50,056 --> 00:54:52,012
We're in the clear, right?

485
00:54:52,136 --> 00:54:55,048
It's just their word
against ours?

486
00:54:56,216 --> 00:54:57,490
Yeah.

487
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:04,608
Well, not quite...

488
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,968
Josh. What're you saying?

489
00:55:10,096 --> 00:55:12,327
I dressed it up in legalese, but...

490
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:15,129
...basically it's all bullshit.

491
00:55:15,257 --> 00:55:17,929
Wouldn't stand up in court.
The girl was off her face.

492
00:55:18,055 --> 00:55:20,091
So there was no informed consent.

493
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:24,087
They'll say it was rape.

494
00:55:25,935 --> 00:55:28,164
- But there's no body.
- Right.

495
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:31,332
Conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice.

496
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,009
Those girls get in front of a jury...

497
00:55:36,616 --> 00:55:40,449
So, basically... we're fucked?

498
00:55:45,696 --> 00:55:47,334
We're not.

499
00:55:49,975 --> 00:55:51,455
Marcus is.

500
00:55:52,696 --> 00:55:58,611
As acting skipper, anything that happens
aboard is... his responsibility.

501
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:03,327
He takes all the heat.

502
00:56:08,056 --> 00:56:10,616
Legally, he's 100% liable.

503
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:18,131
Right word in the wrong ear...

504
00:56:30,575 --> 00:56:34,409
You tricky little bastard.

505
00:56:34,534 --> 00:56:36,173
What?

506
00:56:36,295 --> 00:56:38,684
You think I'd shaft the 'coose?

507
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:43,124
- I'd never...
- Damn right.

508
00:56:43,255 --> 00:56:46,292
Cos I've got a few tricks of my own.

509
00:56:49,936 --> 00:56:52,051
Suck on that, bitch.

510
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:11,932
- Where's Sean?
- Dunno.

511
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:14,170
- Marcus wants you.
- What?

512
00:57:14,294 --> 00:57:17,684
He's in the shower. Dropped the soap.
Needs some help picking it up.

513
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,445
Think you can take the piss?

514
00:57:34,335 --> 00:57:37,008
Sean. I need to...

515
00:57:45,735 --> 00:57:50,206
Right, play time's over.
We've got 45 minutes left.

516
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,372
We reach the International Line,
we call it in.

517
00:57:54,016 --> 00:57:55,608
Well, why aren't we going now?

518
00:57:55,735 --> 00:57:58,568
Until that moment, everyone stays
right here where I can see them.

519
00:58:11,654 --> 00:58:15,203
Why don't you fix us a meal?
I'm starving.

520
00:58:15,334 --> 00:58:18,485
- Starvin' Marvin.
- You are joking.

521
00:58:18,614 --> 00:58:21,924
That's about the only sensible
suggestion I've heard all evening.

522
00:58:22,054 --> 00:58:23,885
Thank you, Marcus.

523
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:26,893
- You're tired...
- Fucking paranoid.

524
00:58:27,015 --> 00:58:28,925
We need to get
some food inside us,

525
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:31,045
before any more accidents happen.

526
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:37,369
Right, then. Why don't we take a look
what's in the kitchen?

527
00:58:45,695 --> 00:58:48,050
Watch them.

528
00:59:14,253 --> 00:59:16,484
Fuck, man. This all there is?

529
00:59:25,734 --> 00:59:27,213
Josh?

530
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:33,167
You know what? This is really tasty.

531
00:59:37,695 --> 00:59:40,050
So what's everyone doing
when we get back?

532
00:59:42,255 --> 00:59:45,133
Reckon it's time for the Bluester
to move on.

533
00:59:45,255 --> 00:59:48,327
Can't face Blighty. Quite fancy Goa.

534
00:59:51,014 --> 00:59:52,527
Ever been?

535
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,050
- No.
- You should.

536
00:59:57,734 --> 01:00:00,088
You're quite a goer yourself.

537
01:00:07,014 --> 01:00:09,209
- Going home, Marcus?
- Am I fuck.

538
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,167
I've still got three months of freedom
before I get badged.

539
01:00:17,334 --> 01:00:19,404
- Marcus...
- Not now Josh.

540
01:00:19,534 --> 01:00:21,728
- We've only got 20 minutes left.
- Leave it.

541
01:00:24,574 --> 01:00:27,133
Bluey didn't chuck the tape.

542
01:00:28,694 --> 01:00:31,367
He lied. He kept it.

543
01:00:36,693 --> 01:00:38,923
Someone's got a big mouth.

544
01:00:43,734 --> 01:00:46,372
Marcus, we had an understanding.

545
01:00:48,052 --> 01:00:50,009
Yeah, well, understand this.

546
01:00:50,132 --> 01:00:53,045
I'm not your brother's
get-out-of-jail free card.

547
01:00:55,093 --> 01:00:56,571
What are you going to do with it?

548
01:00:56,693 --> 01:01:00,572
First edit me and 'coose out, then post it
on the web. A pound a pop. Kerching!

549
01:01:00,692 --> 01:01:03,253
- Bluey...
- Josh will be a YouTube superstar.

550
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:07,571
Don't wet your panties, Josh.
Stay in line, yeah?

551
01:01:08,493 --> 01:01:11,371
You girlies wouldn't get out of line,
would you?

552
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:15,530
No, they're gonna say the right thing.
Aren't you?

553
01:01:18,333 --> 01:01:20,927
Lisa always partied a bit too hard.

554
01:01:26,173 --> 01:01:28,324
Everyone knew it.

555
01:01:28,454 --> 01:01:30,729
So it was an accident?

556
01:01:36,654 --> 01:01:39,008
She had too much to drink.

557
01:01:40,733 --> 01:01:43,327
Went outside to clear her head.

558
01:01:46,053 --> 01:01:48,612
That were the last that I saw of her.

559
01:01:49,613 --> 01:01:53,207
- Marcus, I trusted you...
- Those two hate my guts, fair enough.

560
01:01:53,333 --> 01:01:56,483
Now I've got your fucking little weasel of
a brother trying to turn Bluey against me.

561
01:01:56,572 --> 01:02:00,201
Think I don't like all this fussing
and fighting. Why can't we all just?

562
01:02:00,333 --> 01:02:04,292
- I'm warning you. Do not touch me.
- Come on. You girlies are so tense.

563
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:08,006
Let the Bluester work you
with his magic fingers.

564
01:02:08,133 --> 01:02:10,010
Leave her alone.

565
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:12,931
I know what this is about.
She's jealous.

566
01:02:13,053 --> 01:02:15,931
Kim gets all the attention.
You're too uptight.

567
01:02:16,054 --> 01:02:17,725
That's why your boyfriend
shagged around.

568
01:02:18,013 --> 01:02:20,972
- Wanker!
- Bet he shagged Kim, too, didn't he?

569
01:02:21,093 --> 01:02:24,607
Oh...
I don't blame you sweetheart.

570
01:02:24,732 --> 01:02:28,566
- I myself am a diagnosed sex addict.
- Yeah, well, try cold turkey!

571
01:02:28,693 --> 01:02:31,046
Tried it, mate. Prefer hot pussy.

572
01:02:34,492 --> 01:02:37,085
Right. Let's do it.

573
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:40,409
No one calls it in until I have that tape.

574
01:02:40,532 --> 01:02:42,921
- Sean, just call it!
- "Sean, just call it!"

575
01:02:43,052 --> 01:02:44,690
Who cares?
We've got a beautiful boat...

576
01:02:44,972 --> 01:02:46,644
- You promised!
...a bag full of drugs...

577
01:02:46,733 --> 01:02:48,688
...two lovely ladies...
- That's enough!

578
01:02:48,972 --> 01:02:51,406
We could do it again.
You and Kim, a little double act?

579
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:53,125
- Email it to your ex?
- Bluey!

580
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:56,450
Show him what he's missing.
Come on, give us a kiss, huh?

581
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,325
Don't you fucking touch me!

582
01:03:13,693 --> 01:03:17,402
Get it out... get it out of me!

583
01:03:17,533 --> 01:03:19,649
Do not touch that knife!

584
01:03:20,493 --> 01:03:24,610
Marcus! Let go of her!
You're choking her!

585
01:03:30,333 --> 01:03:33,449
Give me the Special K.
Give me the Ketamine, man!

586
01:03:40,972 --> 01:03:43,725
- Shall I give him Special K?
- Just give it to him for fucksake!

587
01:03:44,012 --> 01:03:45,650
Here.

588
01:03:51,332 --> 01:03:53,129
You're gonna be fine.

589
01:03:53,252 --> 01:03:56,006
Your lungs are filling up with blood
but that's why God gave you two.

590
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:58,210
Tammi, open up!

591
01:03:59,012 --> 01:04:02,608
Tammi, please open the door!
What the fuck is going on?

592
01:04:08,731 --> 01:04:12,007
Josh, back up. Open the door!

593
01:05:05,093 --> 01:05:06,366
Kim.

594
01:05:07,492 --> 01:05:10,961
Kim, where's the fucking motor?

595
01:05:12,051 --> 01:05:13,325
No! No!

596
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:17,365
Where the hell are they?
We've got to find those girls!

597
01:05:17,492 --> 01:05:19,163
Josh, where are they?

598
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,042
The flare.

599
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:29,525
They've got that fucking tape, Tammi.

600
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:31,846
We can't prove nothing
without that tape.

601
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:35,122
- Well, do you wanna go and get it?
- No! Fuck that!

602
01:05:35,251 --> 01:05:38,607
We'll have to find help.
Tell them what happened.

603
01:05:38,731 --> 01:05:41,803
There has to be something in here.

604
01:05:41,932 --> 01:05:44,445
Which of these flares? Red or blue?

605
01:05:44,572 --> 01:05:46,368
Kim?

606
01:05:48,972 --> 01:05:53,124
If we wait out here till tomorrow,
no one'll find us. We can die out here!

607
01:05:59,331 --> 01:06:02,323
What are you doing?
They'll see us!

608
01:06:11,690 --> 01:06:13,682
Oh, no, they've seen us.

609
01:06:21,251 --> 01:06:23,560
Fucking seen us, ain't they?

610
01:06:46,011 --> 01:06:48,400
I'll throw you down the rope, OK?
Grab it.

611
01:06:48,532 --> 01:06:51,443
Fuck off.
We're not getting on your fucking boat!

612
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:53,527
- What are you doing?
- Kim, just...

613
01:06:55,492 --> 01:06:57,447
Hold on!

614
01:07:01,611 --> 01:07:03,203
OK, I've got it.

615
01:07:08,050 --> 01:07:10,086
Marcus!

616
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,159
- Get back on this fucking boat.
- Fuck you!

617
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:25,368
Get on the boat. Now!

618
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:29,199
If you don't get on this boat, I'm going
to shoot that thing from under you.

619
01:07:29,331 --> 01:07:31,970
- Marcus, put it down.
- Back off!

620
01:07:34,971 --> 01:07:37,928
- You fucking stabbed Bluey.
- He asked for it.

621
01:07:38,051 --> 01:07:41,247
- Get on the boat.
- Back off or I swear to fucking God...!

622
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,040
Aaargh! Fuck!

623
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:52,000
Aaargh! Fucking hell! Help!

624
01:07:52,129 --> 01:07:54,086
Fucking help me, please!

625
01:07:55,609 --> 01:07:57,521
Jump in the water!

626
01:08:01,329 --> 01:08:03,002
It's alight in the fucking water!

627
01:08:03,129 --> 01:08:05,041
Do something!

628
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:11,480
You shot him!
You fucking shot him!

629
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:47,160
You. Stay here.

630
01:08:50,691 --> 01:08:53,124
Fucking let us out!

631
01:09:01,970 --> 01:09:03,243
Shit.

632
01:09:11,370 --> 01:09:14,248
What the fuck's going on?

633
01:09:16,569 --> 01:09:19,368
What the fuck have we done?

634
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:22,129
This is all your fault.

635
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:23,923
What?

636
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:25,961
You stabbed Bluey.

637
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:29,244
Got on a stupid dinghy.

638
01:09:29,369 --> 01:09:31,486
Let the flare go.
The boys come back to us.

639
01:09:31,609 --> 01:09:33,486
We wouldn't even be in Spain
if it weren't for you!

640
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,440
Shut up!

641
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:53,797
Oh, fuck.

642
01:09:53,929 --> 01:09:55,806
Marcus is dead.

643
01:09:55,929 --> 01:09:57,521
Yeah, I know.

644
01:09:58,649 --> 01:10:00,719
But what are we gonna do?

645
01:10:04,929 --> 01:10:06,727
Where the fuck are the keys?

646
01:10:07,690 --> 01:10:10,044
- I... I don't...
- Look downstairs.

647
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:39,519
Sean! Let us out! Sean?

648
01:10:41,088 --> 01:10:42,919
Fucking let us out!

649
01:10:45,448 --> 01:10:47,325
Marcus must have had them.

650
01:10:49,529 --> 01:10:51,167
Shit.

651
01:10:55,048 --> 01:10:56,926
- Right, call it.
- And say what?

652
01:10:57,049 --> 01:10:59,927
Call it! We need the Medevac now
or he will die.

653
01:11:00,049 --> 01:11:03,086
Please, man... I don't wanna die.

654
01:11:06,049 --> 01:11:08,005
OK. Yeah. I'll call it.

655
01:11:42,329 --> 01:11:43,921
Come on.

656
01:11:44,929 --> 01:11:46,282
Come on.

657
01:11:49,449 --> 01:11:51,325
There we go. I've got you.

658
01:11:52,288 --> 01:11:55,361
I've got you.
There we go. You OK?

659
01:11:55,489 --> 01:11:58,367
Come on. I've got you.

660
01:12:02,329 --> 01:12:03,682
There we go.

661
01:12:05,569 --> 01:12:07,207
That's right.

662
01:12:11,249 --> 01:12:14,161
Just through in the other room.
Just through here.

663
01:12:17,488 --> 01:12:18,967
There we go.

664
01:12:20,328 --> 01:12:21,681
Just here.

665
01:12:24,047 --> 01:12:25,925
In you go. In here.

666
01:12:31,327 --> 01:12:33,637
OK? I'm just going to sit you down,
all right?

667
01:12:35,168 --> 01:12:38,638
We can chat in here. All right,
I've got you. All right? I've got you.

668
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:41,482
OK?

669
01:13:23,367 --> 01:13:25,324
I just need to know...

670
01:13:26,608 --> 01:13:29,121
Where's the tape, Bluey?

671
01:13:31,727 --> 01:13:33,319
My sister...

672
01:13:35,128 --> 01:13:39,246
- I need to call my sister.
- OK. OK.

673
01:13:40,288 --> 01:13:43,246
- Just tell me...
- I need to speak to her.

674
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:46,285
Where's the tape?

675
01:13:54,648 --> 01:13:56,366
It's gonna fucking take forever.

676
01:13:59,248 --> 01:14:02,284
Oh, fuck it hurts. Give me K.

677
01:14:05,007 --> 01:14:07,043
I need K.

678
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:22,680
One of us is gonna
have to go at it, Kim.

679
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:28,440
You want me
to run through a glass door?

680
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:34,086
Babe?

681
01:14:35,368 --> 01:14:37,199
You're heavier.

682
01:15:07,127 --> 01:15:09,594
Oh, my God, Tam, you did it.

683
01:15:21,327 --> 01:15:22,680
Are you OK?

684
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:27,606
- You want to find out if he's all right?
- I don't care about him. Are you OK?

685
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:34,356
No tape. No drugs.

686
01:16:59,685 --> 01:17:01,323
In the bedroom.

687
01:17:03,166 --> 01:17:05,043
Under the bed.

688
01:17:05,166 --> 01:17:06,918
Please.

689
01:17:07,046 --> 01:17:08,445
Please...

690
01:17:43,045 --> 01:17:44,637
Fuck!

691
01:18:05,445 --> 01:18:06,720
Oh, you prick.

692
01:18:12,246 --> 01:18:15,682
You're 30 minutes from dying.
We're an hour from shore.

693
01:18:17,566 --> 01:18:19,044
Mate, I told you...

694
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:51,678
Ah!

695
01:18:57,485 --> 01:18:58,964
Ah!

696
01:18:59,685 --> 01:19:01,164
Fuck!

697
01:19:06,925 --> 01:19:08,245
I told you!

698
01:19:14,205 --> 01:19:15,639
Fuck!

699
01:19:21,685 --> 01:19:23,164
Fuck!

700
01:19:23,725 --> 01:19:26,842
Fucking told you,
it's in the fucking bed...

701
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:30,161
Where the fuck is it? Where is it?

702
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:39,318
Stupid, inbred fuckwit.

703
01:19:41,245 --> 01:19:44,317
- Where is it?
- It's under the bed...

704
01:19:45,485 --> 01:19:48,283
No. Stop it! Leave him alone!
He hasn't got it!

705
01:20:32,325 --> 01:20:34,155
Kim!

706
01:20:57,445 --> 01:20:59,242
He's dead.

707
01:21:01,245 --> 01:21:03,600
He was losing too much blood.

708
01:21:05,206 --> 01:21:07,480
There's nothing I could have done.

709
01:21:12,325 --> 01:21:14,918
Yeah. It's not my fault.

710
01:21:15,043 --> 01:21:16,317
You liar.

711
01:21:27,124 --> 01:21:28,443
The tape.

712
01:21:30,044 --> 01:21:32,239
You knew he didn't have it.

713
01:21:35,605 --> 01:21:37,435
Why aren't you taking us home?

714
01:21:38,444 --> 01:21:40,560
I can't find the keys.

715
01:21:45,325 --> 01:21:47,361
Get away from her.

716
01:21:51,723 --> 01:21:53,954
Now back the fuck off.

717
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:58,283
He's got the keys.

718
01:21:59,523 --> 01:22:01,002
Move.

719
01:22:02,523 --> 01:22:04,514
Fucking move!

720
01:22:17,124 --> 01:22:19,683
Get in there. Fucking move.

721
01:22:27,044 --> 01:22:28,363
Kim.

722
01:22:28,484 --> 01:22:30,236
Kim, give me that.

723
01:22:33,204 --> 01:22:36,594
- Where is Sean?
- Shut up! Fucking take me home!

724
01:23:02,083 --> 01:23:03,914
Josh! What's going on?

725
01:23:04,443 --> 01:23:05,717
Open the door!

726
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:11,356
- Call for help.
- I can't.

727
01:23:12,123 --> 01:23:14,034
Sean reset the channels.
I don't know how.

728
01:23:14,163 --> 01:23:15,915
Liar.

729
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:21,203
Where the fuck is he?

730
01:23:21,723 --> 01:23:25,603
- He's with his precious engines, safe.
- Not when we're running...

731
01:23:25,723 --> 01:23:27,362
- Liar!
- He'll die down there.

732
01:23:27,483 --> 01:23:30,123
Open the door! Open the door!

733
01:23:30,243 --> 01:23:33,554
Everything that comes
out of your mouth is a lie.

734
01:23:34,684 --> 01:23:36,322
Tammi!

735
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:40,154
You stay...

736
01:23:41,443 --> 01:23:46,470
Have you thought about what you're
gonna say... when we get back?

737
01:23:48,962 --> 01:23:51,476
Yeah. You're going to prison.

738
01:23:53,242 --> 01:23:54,561
You, too.

739
01:23:54,682 --> 01:23:56,240
Fuck you.

740
01:23:56,362 --> 01:23:59,035
What I did... was an accident.

741
01:24:00,683 --> 01:24:03,322
But you're both up for murder.

742
01:24:04,523 --> 01:24:08,311
And if your friend goes to court
with that tape...

743
01:24:10,483 --> 01:24:13,520
Let me out, Josh, please!

744
01:24:17,123 --> 01:24:19,114
Sean, you've got to help me.

745
01:24:19,243 --> 01:24:20,835
You talk a load of shit.

746
01:24:20,963 --> 01:24:24,160
I promise you,
you don't want that tape getting out.

747
01:24:27,683 --> 01:24:31,562
- We can help each other.
- You want me to help you?

748
01:24:31,683 --> 01:24:36,963
Listen. Marcus, Bluey and Lisa
were fooling around.

749
01:24:38,524 --> 01:24:41,037
One of them killed Lisa.

750
01:24:41,162 --> 01:24:45,361
Bluey argued with Marcus,
and they killed each other.

751
01:24:45,483 --> 01:24:47,439
We stick to that story...

752
01:24:48,682 --> 01:24:50,513
...clean the knife...

753
01:24:51,642 --> 01:24:53,360
...dump the tape...

754
01:24:54,682 --> 01:24:56,912
...and we all walk.

755
01:25:11,483 --> 01:25:14,122
- Sean. Thank God.
- What the fuck hap?

756
01:25:14,243 --> 01:25:17,552
- What have you done to her?
- The crazy bitch was gonna kill me.

757
01:25:17,683 --> 01:25:19,798
Josh, don't! What the fuck?

758
01:25:19,923 --> 01:25:21,436
- She's got it.
- What?

759
01:25:21,563 --> 01:25:24,201
- Sean...
- Bluey's tape.

760
01:25:24,322 --> 01:25:26,438
Just give it to me.

761
01:25:26,562 --> 01:25:31,556
Give me that gun, now.
I want that gun. Josh...

762
01:25:31,682 --> 01:25:34,320
- Don't!
- Please don't make me do this.

763
01:25:34,441 --> 01:25:37,002
- Josh. It's over!
- Get out of my way!

764
01:25:39,521 --> 01:25:42,513
This is enough! Fuck!

765
01:25:45,001 --> 01:25:46,354
It's over!

766
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:49,437
It's over!

767
01:26:12,323 --> 01:26:13,915
Oh, fuck!

768
01:26:15,243 --> 01:26:16,800
Oh, fuck!

769
01:26:16,922 --> 01:26:18,481
Sean! Sean!

770
01:26:25,922 --> 01:26:27,958
Sean. Sean.

771
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,674
Sean...

772
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:35,518
He had the gun.

773
01:26:37,161 --> 01:26:39,470
He was gonna kill you...
He had a gun.

774
01:26:48,281 --> 01:26:52,275
Kim!
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry...

775
01:26:58,002 --> 01:26:59,993
What have you done?

776
01:27:00,122 --> 01:27:02,636
He was trying to help us!

777
01:27:08,682 --> 01:27:10,114
Kim...

778
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:15,441
Babe, don't!

779
01:27:19,041 --> 01:27:21,235
Don't leave me here.

780
01:27:25,041 --> 01:27:26,519
Kim, no!

781
01:27:32,041 --> 01:27:33,554
No!

782
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,520
Kim, no!

783
01:28:06,682 --> 01:28:08,718
They're dead.

784
01:28:11,241 --> 01:28:12,913
They're all dead.

785
01:28:16,641 --> 01:28:18,518
What are we gonna do?

786
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:24,034
Josh, we have to get off this thing,
cos if they find us here...

787
01:28:27,681 --> 01:28:30,035
Come on. I am not staying here.

788
01:28:30,161 --> 01:28:32,469
I'm getting off this fucking boat
right now.

789
01:28:34,161 --> 01:28:36,834
OK. OK...

790
01:28:36,961 --> 01:28:39,111
Yeah. I'll come, too.

791
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:31,887
Right,
come on.

792
01:29:39,321 --> 01:29:40,674
Hurry up.

793
