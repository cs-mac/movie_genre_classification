1
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,320
Thank you very kindly.

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,000
Ladies and gentlemen,
right now we'd like to introduce...

3
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,560
the star of our show, the young man
you've all been waiting for.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,640
So let's all get together and welcome
him to the stage with a great big hand.

5
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,760
How about it for Sam Cooke?

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
Before we do anything, we'd like
to say how are you doing out there?

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,240
- Is everyone feeling all right?
- Yeah!

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,800
How are you doing?

9
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,400
- You doing okay?
- Yeah!

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,760
- You two doing okay?
- Yeah!

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,440
Well, I ask you one more time.
How you doing?

12
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, yeah

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,920
I said oh, yeah

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,920
Oh, yeah!

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh, yeah

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,960
Oh, yeah!

17
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,480
I believe we're gonna have
a goodtime tonight

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,240
It's good to have somebody
you can twist the night away with

19
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,320
Right now

20
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,720
Oh, yes, it is

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,800
I said it feels good
when you got somebody

22
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,360
To twist the night away
with right now

23
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,680
- Lord have mercy.
- What you running from, son?

24
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,800
We got a call.

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,920
Don't fight the feelin'
Don't fight the feelin'

26
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,520
Got to feel the feelin' now
Got to feel the feelin'

27
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,920
'Cause it make you groove right
when you feel the feelin'

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,120
Oh, make me want you now

29
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,440
Got to feel the feelin'

30
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,040
'Cause it make you groove right
when you feel the feelin'

31
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,520
Make me want ya
when I got the feelin', baby

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,720
So don't fight it

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,640
No, don't fight it

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,200
Baby, just feel it

35
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,920
I'm gonna bust you up.

36
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,480
Beat your ass
like I was your daddy.

37
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,400
I said I'm beginning
to feel allright now

38
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,000
I feel can tell you
about my baby right now

39
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,880
I said I feel
you're in the mood right now

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,600
I said I feel
you're in the mood

41
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,360
Some times me and my baby
we fuss and fight

42
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,240
And my baby leave home
'cause things ain't right

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,640
For those of you
who think you came here today...

44
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,320
to hear us tell you
like these Negro leaders do...

45
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,880
that your times
will just get better...

46
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,760
that we shall
overcome someday...

47
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,760
I say to you,
you came to the wrong place.

48
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,000
Because your times will never
get better unless you make them better.

49
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,960
Those of you who think you came here
to hear us tell you...

50
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,480
to turn the other cheek
to the brutality of the white man...

51
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,280
and this system of injustice
that's in place right here in America...

52
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,600
you think you're gonna come here
and hear us tell you...

53
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,520
to go out there and beg
for a place at their lunch counter...

54
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,360
again, I say you came
to the wrong place.

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,680
We don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the South.

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,400
And we don't teach you
to turn the other cheek in the North.

57
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,120
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad
teaches you to obey the law...

58
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,840
to Cary yourselves
in a respectable way...

59
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,360
in a proud
Afro-American way.

60
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,480
But at the same time,
we teach you...

61
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,800
that anyone puts
their hand on you...

62
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,760
brother, you do your best to see they
don't put their hand on anybody else...

63
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,040
again.

64
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,600
Time.

65
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,080
Just like that, Daddy.

66
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
Never jump in one place.
Bad for the heart.

67
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,680
Forwards, backwards, sideways.

68
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,560
That's the most important thing.

69
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,280
I'm called Bundini.

70
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,760
Rhymes with Houdini.
He was a Jew too.

71
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,400
Some people call me Fast Black.
Some call me Daddy Mac.

72
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,080
Gave Sugar Ray Robinson
my power for seven years.

73
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,520
My voodoo. My magic.

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,400
Now Shorty done sent me here
to work for you.

75
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,560
- Who's Shorty?
- I call him Shorty.

76
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,720
Call him Shorty
'cause he like 'em circumcised.

77
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,400
Original people. Like Moses.
And I was a babe in a basket too.

78
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,520
Born on a doorstep with a note
across my chest that read...

79
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,520
"You do the best
you can for him, world. "

80
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,440
I wanna be your inspiration.

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,080
Your motivator in your corner.

82
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,400
Can I be in your corner,
young man?

83
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,880
Time!

84
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,960
Got to tell you
how I feel right now

85
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,760
This song gonna tell you
howl feel

86
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,640
Baby, if you ever

87
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,680
Change your mind

88
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,880
Know that leaving

89
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,640
Leaving me behind

90
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,440
Bring it tome

91
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,520
Bring that good lovin', baby

92
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,640
Bring it on home to me

93
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,000
Yeah, yeah

94
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,600
Listen, I got to be a man
to tell you this, honey, look

95
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,640
I'll give you jewelry

96
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,680
I'll give you some
of that money too

97
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,240
But listen
That ain't all

98
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,920
That ain't all
Sam will do for you

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,120
All you got to do
is bring it tome

100
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,000
Bring that good lovin' baby

101
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,960
Be the invisible man
as soon as he swings.

102
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,680
Get personal with him.

103
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,080
This is important
Listen tome

104
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,240
Don't you know
that I'll always

105
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,240
I'll always be your slave

106
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,840
Till I'm buried

107
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,200
Buried in my grave

108
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,200
While I'm livin'

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,360

Bring that good lovin', baby

Bring it on home to me

111
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,560
One more thing
I gotta tell you

112
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,280
Listen to me right now

113
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,440
You know that I try

114
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,440
To treat you right
What did you do

115
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,440
You stayed up

116
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,640
You stayed up late at night

117
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,600
I don't care
who you was with

118
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,480
Bring it tome

119
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
Bring all that good lovin', baby

120

Bring it on
Everybody's with me

121
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,520
Everybody's with me tonight

122
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
Listen, let me hear you
say yeah

123
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,760
Yeah, oh, yeah

124
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
Sonny Liston,
you ain't no champ! You a chump!

125
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,440
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

126
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,400
Oh!
Rumble, young man, rumble.

127
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
Y'all wanna lose y' all money?
Then you bet it on Sonny.

128
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,920
He know I'm great.
He will fall in eight.

129
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,640
Come on, you big, ugly bear.
I'll whup you right now.

130
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:43,520
Two-ten and a half.
Two-ten and a half!.

131
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,240
The challenger, Cassius Clay,
two hundred and ten and a half pounds.

132
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,800
- Man, you sure that's right?
- That's what the weight is.

133
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,360
Old, ugly bear, come on.
Let's go.

134
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,720
You got these folks fooled. I ain't
scared of ya! I ain't scared of ya!

135
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,640
Two hundred and eighteen.
Two hundred and eighteen.

136
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,480
Sonny Liston,
the champion of the world.

137
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,760
Two hundred and eighteen pounds.

138
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,800
- Pounds of what?
- Pounds of ugly.

139
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,280
That man's so ugly,
when he sweat...

140
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,000
the sweat run backwards off his forehand
just to stay away from his face.

141
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,920
Come on, you big, ugly bear!
I'll turn you into a rug!

142
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,360
Keep talkin'.
I'm gonna fuck you up.

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,000
If you whup me...

144
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,840
I'll crawl out of the ring and take
the first jet airplane out the country.

145
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:37,920
- Is that a promise, Mr. Clay?
- You'll eat his words first.

146
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,680
- Cassius, you're a 7-1 underdog.
- Liston says he talks with his fists.

147
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,640
- What do you say?
- You scared of him?

148
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,880
I'm gonna give Sonny Liston
talkin' lessons...

149
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,320
boxin' lessons
and fallin' down lessons.

150
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,080
Cassius, are you a black Muslim?
Pat Putnam says in the Miami Herald--

151
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,600
A man's religion is his own business.
What kind of question is that?

152
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,680
- Angelo, tell me--

153
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,800
Was that so
he wouldn't embarrass you?

154
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,680
- Yeah, Howard?
- Liston doesn't like you.

155
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,480
Really can't stand you.
Says he wants to kill you.

156
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
Howard Cosell, you ain't
nothin' but an instigator.

157
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,040
- Man, how you get that way?
- Cassius, now you're being truculent.

158
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,520
If it's good, I'm that.

159
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,400
You next. Soon as I'm done with Sonny
Liston, I'm fightin' Howard Cosell.

160
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,360
Y'all write that down right now.

161
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,520
That's good?

162
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,040
Wanna check that out?

163
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,320
Hey, man, when you get back?

164
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,040
I just got here.
I'm front row, seat seven.

165
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,480
I'll be sittin'
with Mom and Dad.

166
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,640
You should've stayed in the first place.
Nobody gotta hide when they're with me.

167
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,960
There's nothing wrong
with being cool, my brother.

168
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,920
He's right.

169
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,000
- ...and challenger, Cassius Clay.
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

170
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
Brought to you
by the City Service Oil Company...

171
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,560
and its dealers
in 37 states and Canada...

172
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
known to millions of motorists
for Big Gallon gasoline...

173
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,560
and by new Wildroot,
totally new Wildroot in a new tube...

174
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:15,520
with a great formula that grooms hair
to look neat and natural, never greasy.

175
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,840
Another boxing milestone
is at hand.

176
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,680
In just a few minutes,
Louisville's Cassius Marcellus Clay...

177
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,760
will be facing
the devastating punching power...

178
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:26,960
of the heavyweight champion,
Charles "Sonny" Liston.

179
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,000
...for the heavyweight championship
of the world.

180
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,280
Introducing, on my right--

181
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,120
And now the time has come.

182
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,600
Both challenger and champion
are in the ring.

183
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,960
The heavyweight championship
of the world is on the line.

184
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,680
I fit goes past the first round,
there will be surprises already.

185
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,680
Sonny Liston wrapped in that
terry cloth towel of his...

186
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,320
wrapped around his head
swami fashion...

187
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,120
Looking as malevolent
and baleful as ever.

188
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,400
But this man
is a professional prizefighter.

189
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,440
Make no mistake about it.

190
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,360
I want a clean fight.

191
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,720
When I say break,
stop punching and step back.

192
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,800
Do you have
any questions, champ?

193
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,640
Any questions, challenger?

194
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,320
We're fine.
Touch gloves, gentlemen. Good luck.

195
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,880
Good evening,
sports fans across the nation.

196
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,440
Liston in the white trunks
with the black stripes.

197
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,480
Clay, an inch and a half taller, in
the white trunks with the red stripes--

198
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,680
And Cassius Clay
is sidestepping.

199
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,960
There it is, champ.
Stay on your toes now.

200
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,120
And we can see that the champion
is the aggressor.

201
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,640
There's a shot under the heart.

202
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,720
Cassius Clay slips away.
And now Clay pounds a left.

203
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,680
Another left. A straight jab.

204
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,720
It seems to have stunned him.
And that's the bell.

205
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,080
And they're fighting after the bell.
And they're still fighting.

206
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,640
This round is over.

207
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,440
Break it up, ref.

208
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,480
There is no love lost between
the two contenders at this time.

209
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,240
Cassius goes back to his corner.

210
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,720
You can beat this guy.

211
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,520
I'm still here.

212
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,840
And Sonny Liston
is not taking the stool.

213
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,800
He's anxious to get back
into the challenger's face.

214
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,680
Take it to the body.
Kill the body, the head will follow.

215
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,680
This is a totally different fight
than Liston expected...

216
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,520
and anyone in this arena
will tell you.

217
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,800
There's a long, looping left hand.
Clay's eyes are wide open now.

218
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:18,320
- Come on, Cass! Move!
- Step back.

219
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,000
- Come on, Cassius!
- Come on, Chi-Chi!

220
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm not prognosticating
anything...

221
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,840
but merely his survival
to this juncture--

222
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,720
Cass, hit him!

223
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,320
Break.

224
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,520
Let him go.

225
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,320
Sonny Liston is hurt.
He's bleeding from his eye.

226
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,440
He's defying the experts early.

227
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,160
We have to take a look at this man and
say he is not in awe of the champion.

228
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,720
He ain't nothin' to me.
And he know it.

229
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,160
This is it now.

230
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,760
Let me have that, John.

231
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,160
And now they're ready.

232
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,640
You gonna knock
the ugly off of him.

233
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,880
That's gonna take a long time,
but you can do it.

234
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,040
There he is. Get him off.
Do your job, ref.

235
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,040
Shake him.
Do your job, ref.

236
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,800
There it is.

237
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,080
Come on, ref.

238
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,760
Break.

239
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,960
- There he is.
- Clay slips around and out.

240
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,440
Up against the ropes.
Right above me now.

241
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,840
Too tight. Get in there.

242
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,720
My eyes. There's something in my eyes.
I can't see nothin'.

243
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,840
Come on.

244
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,480
- What's going on?
- Nothin'.

245
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,960
The guy's punchin' on the breaks.
Just take care of it. We're fine.

246
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,200
I can't see nothin', man.
Just go and cut 'em off, Angie.

247
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,960
No, no. You can't fight
with no gloves on.

248
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,640
Just get up. Get up.
Try and do it. Come on.

249
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,040
I can't see, man.

250
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
- Come on, Cass!
- Dance!

251
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
Liston crouching,
hitting to the body.

252
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,880
It's like he's blinking,
like he doesn't see Liston.

253
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,440
Ref, you gotta do your job.

254
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,760
Hold it.

255
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,920
Stay away from him, Clay.
Stay away from him.

256
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,958
The champion, you can see,
is the aggressor.

257
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,000
- Get him, Cass!
- Come on, Cass!

258
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,440
- Knock him up!
- Clay looks all done.

259
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,440
Hold on to him!

260
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,160
- Stop it. Stop. Break.
- Knock him up.

261
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,720
Get on him.
Get on him, man.

262
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,040
- You can see him now.
- You go get him, man.

263
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,120
Clay lands a left,
but Liston ducked under it...

264
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,360
and took it high
on the forehead.

265
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,400
It's Clay coming on.

266
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,720
And Liston backs away.

267
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,080
And all the predictions
are going down the drain...

268
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,000
as Liston is listless.

269
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,000
And there's the bell.

270
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,640
We're coming up
to round seven.

271
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
Wait a minute!

272
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,440
Liston's not coming out.

273
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,560
The winner and new heavyweight
champion of the world is Cassius Clay.

274
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,520
Eat your words!
Eat your words!

275
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:32,200
Les, I'm going up into the ring.
Get back.

276
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,640
I'm the greatest thing
ever happened to boxing.

277
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,480
Cassius. Cassius.

278
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,000
I shook up the world!

279
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,200
It's a scene of
absolute bedlam in the ring!

280
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,360
I am the greatest.
I'm a bad man. I shook up the world!

281
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,080
Did he ever hurt you?

282
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:52,040
I'm only 22 years old.
I ain't got a mark on my face.

283
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,958
- I must be the greatest.
- And you're pretty.

284
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,880
I must be the greatest.

285
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,080
Wait. Hold on. Hold on one second.
That's Sam Cooke back there.

286
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,000
- Come on, Sam Cooke.
- Let Sam Cooke in here.

287
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,840
The greatest rock-and-roll singer,
and I'm the world's greatest boxer.

288
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,360
Hello, Sam.

289
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,000
That mummy's
gonna get him, baby.

290
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,120
- That mummy ain't gonna get him.
- Yeah, he is.

291
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,280
He ain't scared of that mummy.
That mummy too slow to catch anybody.

292
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,720
- What's going on, Sam?
- How you doing, Cassius?

293
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,080
Don't believe that stuff on TV.
Don't listen to him.

294
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,160
- Hey, congratulations, Clay.
- Hey, thank you, Jim.

295
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,120
- Hell of a fight.
- You next, man. You next.

296
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,360
- Go ahead and get some food, brother.
- Cassius Clay versus Jim Brown.

297
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,800
Biggest fight in history.

298
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,880
- The mummy only has one eye.
- One eye and a limp.

299
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,440
That mummy's 643 years old.

300
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,360
He can't catch nobody.
Look at him.

301
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,480
You gotta fall down 'cause that's
the only way the mummy could catch you.

302
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,920
Way to go, champ!

303
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,760
- Yeah, you the greatest.
- Thank you, brother. Thank you.

304
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,720
- I'll see your next fight.
- You'll see the next one?

305
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,520
- Oh, yeah.
- Well, you better get there very early.

306
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,480
You better get there very early
'cause that man's going down.

307
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,600
If he talk a little jive,
he's going down in five.

308
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,280
He talk a little more,
I might drop him in four.

309
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,440
If you wanna have more fun,
do it in round one.

310
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,080
The people really look up to you. You
plan on being a champ like Joe Louis?

311
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:52,000
Well, yeah, I'm gonna be
the people's champ.

312
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,360
Not like Joe Louis.
Well, you know, not exactly.

313
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,760
My name is not Clay.

314
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,280
Clay is the name of the people
that owned my ancestors...

315
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,240
and I no longer wanna be called
by that slave name.

316
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,480
- I am Cassius X.
- Minister Malcolm.

317
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,720
What about the divisions
in the Nation of Islam?

318
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,640
This is the champ's time. I'm here
as a friend to support his victory...

319
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,080
so I have nothing you want.

320
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,040
I'm definitely gonna be
the people's champion...

321
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,440
but I just ain't gonna be the champ
the way you want me to be the champ.

322
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,840
I'm gonna be the champ
the way I wanna be.

323
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,080
...for no home is immune

324
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,120
no matter how well
it is built or maintained.

325
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,080
- Hey, brother.
- I was leaving.

326
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,280
I saw your light on.
What you doing up at this hour, champ?

327
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,960
Oh, man, I'm watching this program
on termites.

328
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,120
And them little itsy-bitsy things is
eatin' these people's whole house down.

329
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,800
Oh, man, look.

330
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,360
I've been invited to speak
at Ibadan University in Nigeria.

331
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,000
- You wanna go with me?
- Hey, look, man.

332
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,040
You can have six million termites
in your house and don't even know it...

333
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,920
till you going to get something to eat
and you bust through the floor.

334
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,320
- What'd you say? Where?
- Africa. You been?

335
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,240
Africa.

336
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,560
All right, come on.
Let's go.

337
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,440
What is it?

338
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
You ever thought
you'd lose it?

339
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,958
I mean, really lose it?

340
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,240
When I was little, I tore out
this picture of Emmett Till.

341
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,160
They put the barbed wire
around his neck...

342
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,240
and strapped him
to that 75-pound cotton gin fan.

343
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,000
And they cut out one of his eyes
'cause he looked at some white lady.

344
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,640
Man.

345
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,640
I couldn't take my eyes to it,
couldn't throw it away.

346
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,840
When I heard about those...

347
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,760
four little girls who got bombed
in that Birmingham church...

348
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,440
the prohibitions of the Honorable
Elijah Muhammad prevented me...

349
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,680
from speaking
my thoughts in action.

350
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,720
Because Birmingham was part
of the civil rights struggle.

351
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:26,840
You know, begging for our place
at the white man's table.

352
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:29,480
But dead children
are dead children.

353
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:33,918
So the anger I felt
I had to contain.

354
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,720
I locked it up so tight...

355
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,640
my muscles seized.

356
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,560
I lost control
over the right side of my body.

357
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,960
My leg gave out.

358
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,640
Right arm gave out.
"I'm having a stroke," I thought.

359
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:54,160
But I had to hold it in
'cause all I wanted--

360
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:58,520
Brother, all I wanted to do
was find something and break it.

361
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,640
Break a part--
Break any part of this system...

362
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:05,760
because you are so provoked
in your heart...

363
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,880
and your spirit
as a human being...

364
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,600
at dead children.

365
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
And I could do...

366
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,360
nothing.

367
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,040
Everyone knows
I can't do nothing...

368
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,480
anymore.

369
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,200
So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me
as a minister in the Nation of Islam.

370
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,080
Man...

371
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,600
you can fix that.

372
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:55,440
I don't know.

373
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,680
I'll try when we get back.

374
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,520
You get some rest, champ.

375
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,440
All right, brother.

376
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,200
Sit.

377
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,520
You know, only after
long service and high merit...

378
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,840
in the spiritual and physical rebirth
of Afro-American people...

379
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,040
is one granted an original name.

380
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,760
But you are special.

381
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,240
A world champion.

382
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,200
So there is a gift
I wish to give you.

383
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,160
From this day forward...

384
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:22,520
you will be known
as Muhammad Ali.

385
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,800
- What?
- That's right.

386
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,720
You what?

387
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,680
Well, what's wrong with our name?
My name?

388
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,960
We-- We made you.

389
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,440
Ain't nobody made me.

390
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,560
No bow tie-wearin',
Arab-talkin' nigger gonna change that.

391
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,480
Ain't nobody in that ring but me.
I made me.

392
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,960
You don't know who you are.

393
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,680
I know who I ain't.
I ain't drinkin'.

394
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,960
I ain't going back on my wife
and for sure I ain't prayin'...

395
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,120
to no blond-haired,
blue-eyed Jesus.

396
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,960
Paintin' those blue-eyed, blond-haired
Jesuses is what put food in you.

397
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,600
- Steak and vegetables on the table.
- It's dinner!

398
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,840
Go ahead.

399
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,200
Go ahead.

400
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,440
Hello?

401
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:35,760
Here you go, Daddy.

402
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,320
Thank you, baby.

403
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,720
- Yeah?
- Brother Malcolm.

404
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,640
The Honorable Elijah Muhammad has given
the Muslim name of Muhammad Ali...

405
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,360
to Cassius X.

406
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,720
Herbert Muhammad has been put
in charge of his training.

407
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,960
He will not be traveling
with you to Africa.

408
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:54,560
He also asked me
to inform you...

409
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,520
that your suspension
will be extended indefinitely.

410
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,080
Brother Cassius
won't be coming to Africa.

411
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,400
Not with me.

412
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,240
Don't put it off.

413
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,120
We'll be fine.

414
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,360
I will.

415
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,480
I got a little doll
for Atallah.

416
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,560
Really?

417
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,200
Yeah, it's beautiful.

418
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,958
I've got so much
to show the girls when I get back.

419
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,320
- I'm taking a lot of pictures.
- Yeah?

420
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,600
Yeah, I got some good stuff
I want to show you.

421
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,520
Are you eating?

422
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,960
Well, you're not cooking, so--

423
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,560
- What's going on? Anything?
- Nothing.

424
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,520
He's on the phone,
talking to his wife.

425
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,640
She's having a hard time sleeping,
the baby's kicking a lot...

426
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,920
what are they gonna
name the baby.

427
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,520
I just wake up a couple of times
in the night, but it's okay.

428
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,880
Would you like to take a seat?

429
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,800
Sure, thank you.

430
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,440
What y'all done did
with the real pilot?

431
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,280
I am the pilot.
He's the copilot.

432
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,200
Here. Sit down, Mr. Clay.

433
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,560
Oh, man.

434
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,400
In Louisville, where I growed up,
they barely let black folks drive buses.

435
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,320
Muhammad!

436
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,280
Hey, brother.
What's going on, man?

437
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,160
- What you doing here?
- I was just going to the airport.

438
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,720
We just got here now.
So where you going?

439
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,680
Liberia.

440
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,040
Say hello to Maya Angelou right here
and Ambassador Huang Hua.

441
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,800
And that is Taher Kaid.
He's the ambassador from Algeria.

442
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,920
Oh, man. Where should I go?
I wanna go all over this place.

443
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,040
Go to Algeria.
See Ben Bella.

444
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,240
Then go to see Mecca and Medina.
I just came from there.

445
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,560
Made my seven circuits
around the Kaaba.

446
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,640
I prayed at sunrise. Two million people.
Pilgrims from all over, man.

447
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:04,480
Blond-haired, blue-eyed Muslims,
Arabs, Africans, Indonesians.

448
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,480
Seeing brothers just like us,
praying together, it was beautiful.

449
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,480
I drank water
from the well of Zem Zem.

450
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,400
I prayed in the ancient city of Mena.
I prayed on Mount Arafat.

451
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,800
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

452
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:34,200
Walking in their footsteps.

453
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,840
All of us together.

454
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,640
You shouldn't have quarreled
with the Honorable Elijah Muhammad.

455
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,000
What?

456
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,400
You shouldn't have quarreled
with Elijah Muhammad.

457
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,880
Hey, Brother Muhammad,
look here.

458
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,880
Brother Muhammad!

459
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,120
Listen, I'm sorry
to keep you waiting.

460
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,200
Into each life...

461
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,240
a little rain must fall.

462
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,080
And, you know,

463
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,720
Every smile is not
a smile of happiness.

464
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,200
And every tear that is shed--

465
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,400
Sonji, Sonji, Sonji.

466
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,040
- What you keep saying my name for?
- 'Cause I love it, girl.

467
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,400
- How long you been working with Herbert?
- About a year.

468
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,240
I sell Muhammad Speaks
over the phone.

469
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,958
- What kind of name is that?
- My father named me after Sonja Henie.

470
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,920
What's your father do?

471
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,920
He was shot in a poker game
when I was two, so he don't do nothing.

472
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,320
And my mother died
when I was eleven.

473
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,120
- Who raised you?
- My godparents.

474
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,040
But I been off on my own
for a long time.

475
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,000
What you doing tomorrow?
Go for a ride with me.

476
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,440
- Oh, no, no. I gotta work.
- I'm gonna square it with Herbert.

477
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,280
- Herbert said you met the Beatles.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

478
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,240
Only one of 'em is smart, though.
The fella with the glasses.

479
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,360
Oh, he is my favorite.

480
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,960
Yeah, folks was screaming
and fainting.

481
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,360
I said, "Man, is this how they act
when you get big?"

482
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,958
- What did he say?
- He said, "Champ...

483
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:36,760
the more real you get,
the more unreal it's gonna get."

484
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,560
Wow.

485
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,640
Your

486
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Precious love

487
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,560
Love

488
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,320
Means more tome

489
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:03,320
More, more

490
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,480
Than any love

491
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,880
Can ever bring me

492
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:11,720
Never came true

493
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,240
Oh, and I

494
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,958
I wanted you

495
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,560
Let me tell ya
I was so lonely

496
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:25,400
So lonely, lonely
So lonely and so blue

497
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,720
Good God All mighty

498
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,880
That's what love will do

499
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,360
Do

500
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,280
Let's go.

501
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,800
Yeah.

502
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,840
Where you live?

503
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,760
I'm gonna take you there.

504
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,200
And you know I got a man somewhere
out there that I don't mind crawling to.

505
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,480
Sometimes I wake up in the midnight
hour, tears rolling down my face.

506
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,400
And if I look around for my man
and I can't find him...

507
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,840
I follow the Lord,
look a little higher.

508
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,560
Kind of pray to the Lord.

509
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,680
Because I always believed that the Lord
could help me if nobody else could.

510
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,600
But sometime
I think he don't even hear me.

511
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,000
So I have to fall a little lower
on my knees, look a little higher.

512
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,080
Kind of raise my voice
a little higher.

513
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,200
And this is what I say
when I call on my man.

514
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:13,600
I especially want you ladies to listen
to me 'cause maybe you can try this.

515
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,600
It might help you
every once in a while.

516
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,040
This is what you say
when you call on your man.

517
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,958
Get in tune to--

518
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,960
Darlin'

519
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,360
Darlin', don't you know

520
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,160
That I love you so much, yeah

521
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,920
Fall down on my knees

522
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,000
Beg my baby, please

523
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,480
I got to tell the man
that I love him, yes, I will

524
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,440
For your precious love

525
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,600
For your precious love

526
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:57,000
There’s nothing
There’s nothing, nothing

527
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,200
In this whole wide world
I wouldn’t do for you, darling

528
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,880
I'll walk all night
out in the rain

529
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,440
Lord, I got to see
my baby again

530
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,000
I got to tell the man
that I love him

531
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:13,080
One more time, yeah

532
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,080
You ain't no Muslim, huh?

533
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,840
Cover my hair, wear no makeup
and wear those long dresses?

534
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,360
Honey, please.

535
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:39,918
Were you a virgin?

536
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,640
A virgin? How you gonna--
What you saying?

537
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:47,918
Well, you were just so gone,
off on a little good time.

538
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,958
Well, no,
I ain't no virgin.

539
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,440
But I may as well be.

540
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,600
I ain't joking.

541
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,280
I always know when I know.

542
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,480
You see this face?

543
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:04,520
You got a pretty face
for a lady's face...

544
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,920
but you ever seen anything
as pretty as me?

545
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,560
Who wouldn't want
to be with me?

546
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,680
What, you five foot three
or something like that?

547
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,200
That's too small for me,
but I'm gonna make an exception.

548
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,520
- Oh, well, thank you.
- Because of your spirit.

549
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,080
- My spirit?
- Yeah, girl. You too much fun.

550
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,640
- But you got to be a Muslim.
- A Muslim?

551
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,120
And how you do that? You jump over
a broom and, shazam, you're a Muslim?

552
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,920
I ain't never been
with nobody like you.

553
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,918
And, baby...

554
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,200
baby, you ain't never
gonna be with any other.

555
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,120
- What?
- That's right.

556
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,320
I wanna marry her.

557
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,800
True love.

558
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:03,720
Have some fun.

559
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,360
She's not your wife.
You don't marry this girl.

560
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,760
Here's some management papers.
I need you to sign right there.

561
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,440
My father would kill me.

562
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,320
Watch what you're signing, Ali.

563
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,240
This ain't got nothing
to do with you.

564
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Anything's to do with me I say is to do
with me, fat boy. I'm still a Christian.

565
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:25,320
And get me a kosher cook. I want
that lady over at Malcolm's temple.

566
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:27,360
- Lana Shabazz.
- And put my brother on payroll.

567
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,880
Fifty G a year
just for drivin' and jivin'.

568
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,760
What do you say, Howard?
Come on full-time as my photographer?

569
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,480
I'm not gonna be on the payroll.
I'm freelance. Emphasis on "free."

570
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,120
Muhammad, she's not for you.

571
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,160
When I met her,
she worked in a cocktail lounge...

572
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,240
with a bunny tail
on her backside.

573
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:46,080
What the hell was you doing
in a bunny tail lounge anyway, Herbert?

574
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,918
Sellin' Muhammad Peeks?

575
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,240
- You been saving it up training, Ali.
- Your ass.

576
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,920
You should spread that stuff around
a little bit before you settle down.

577
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,880
No, man. Marriage is
the cornerstone of Muslim life.

578
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,880
- Yeah, well, Sonji Roi is not a Muslim.
- Well, she's gonna be now.

579
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,240
You just fix it up, Herbert.

580
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,480
Yeah. Okay.

581
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,320
So, why we meeting?

582
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,400
I got Malcolm shoulder to shoulder
with Martin Luther King.

583
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,240
And we got Malcolm traveling all over
the world, getting Ben Bella and Nasser.

584
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,440
We were better off before
with Malcolm inside the Nation.

585
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,960
So we've decided
we want you...

586
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,320
to get Elijah Muhammad
to take Malcolm back.

587
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,360
That's a joke, Joe.

588
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,120
When am I being reimbursed
for my expenses?

589
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,440
Dry-cleaning all these suits
is not free.

590
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,520
We gotta talk about this guy too.

591
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:27,400
Get me receipts, I'll reimburse you
for your dry cleaning.

592
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,520
- What you drinking?
- What I'm drinking?

593
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:41,400
Come on, champ. This is water.
You know I'm a natural man.

594
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,840
You know.

595
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:45,720
- What's going on? We're late.
- I'm changing my damn clothes.

596
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,120
You gave me that look,
so I know you don't like what I had on.

597
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,000
- What is this?
- What you wanted, isn't it?

598
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,200
- A water glass with vodka in it.
- No, that was before.

599
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,560
- Before what, sir?
- Before you showed up. Get out of here.

600
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,918
I'm fine running around here
in these cute, short things for you.

601
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,640
I am submissive to you.

602
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,918
I ain't gonna be submissive to them
Brother X's and Z's...

603
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,800
about what they think.

604
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,320
They ask me a bunch
of questions all the time anyway.

605
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,280
- What questions?
- About you and us.

606
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,958
- And I ain't telling them shit.
- You tell it like it is, sugar.

607
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,440
Took away my boy's name.
What they give him back?

608
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,760
Bad style.

609
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:31,520
I think you drunk.
Daddy Clay, you're something else.

610
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:34,918
Now, that's a firecracker right there.
We're gonna have to work with that.

611
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,880
- A scale of one to ten.
- That's right.

612
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,000
I have one-- I had a ten--
Well, I didn't have a ten.

613
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,640
I had a five--
five good twos.

614
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,640
I don't drink. I don't smoke.
I converted to Islam for you.

615
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,480
Okay? l--
All except the dress.

616
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,520
What you doing in my pockets, man?
Get your hand out of my pocket!

617
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,760
- Hold it, my brothers.
- We got a thief in here!

618
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,840
Just be cool.

619
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,440
Be cool.

620
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:25,920
Brother, you crazy?

621
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:29,240
They killed Malcolm!
They shot Malcolm! They shot Malcolm!

622
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,160
They shot Malcolm!

623
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:37,280
...wash it seven times
in the chest and body...

624
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,840
and one in the lower
right shin.

625
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:43,360
Apparently, the unknown man...

626
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:46,800
walked up
to the speaker's platform...

627
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,520
at the time
Malcolm X was speaking...

628
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,400
opened fire at him
at very short range.

629
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,840
The arena is surrounded by FBI.

630
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,320
The stands are only half full.

631
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:09,240
The promoter has taken out
a million-dollar insurance policy...

632
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,280
due to Cassius Clay's membership in
the militant and radical black Muslims.

633
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:18,280
And, oh, by the way,
Sonny Liston is here too.

634
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:20,840
Touch gloves
and come out fighting.

635
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,640
Come on, son.

636
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,320
- Come on, Chi-Chi.
- Put a whupping on him now.

637
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,080
Ain't nothing changed.

638
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,440
Whup on him now.
Whup up on him.

639
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,720
Way to go!

640
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,480
Yes!

641
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,080
Get up!
Ain't nobody gonna believe this.

642
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Get up!

643
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,360
Yes!

644
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,840
Confused.
We're confused.

645
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,720
- Check his time.
- Timekeeper's sounding it's over.

646
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,640
Check his time!

647
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:53,720
It is over!

648
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:07,920
I think the champ
was in a hurry.

649
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,600
Are you okay?

650
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,600
What's wrong?

651
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,480
Why you all done up like that?

652
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,520
I'm out there dying for you
out of worry.

653
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,040
- Worry?
- Yes.

654
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,440
And all you can think about
is if I look dull enough?

655
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:37,200
What if I straightened my hair
and moved into some white suburb?

656
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,240
How I am says something.

657
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,640
You want me to go get her?

658
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,840
Not now.

659
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,760
- Not right now, fellas.
- Not now.

660
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,520
- What I got to do?
- About Sonji?

661
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,760
Have no contact with her
for 90 days.

662
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:33,000
Make a public statement
of divorce at the mosque...

663
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,160
and Islamic law
will be satisfied.

664
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,560
Satisfaction is not making it with
the woman who send you to the moon?

665
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:40,520
I'm the only normal person
left around here.

666
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:43,080
I'm a black Jew, I can't read
and I'm half drunk.

667
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:46,560
I need to talk to you.

668
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,920
- No, you can stay, Brother Herbert.
- Brother? He ain't your brother.

669
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,080
Your brother's taking your wife back
to Chicago. She's crying like a widow.

670
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,720
- Well, I ain't dead.
- Well, you may as well be.

671
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:59,240
You don't remember your name
or who you are.

672
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:12,280
You gonna try for Germany?

673
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,000
You gonna try to get
stationed in Germany?

674
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:18,640
- Everybody is trying to avoid Vietnam.
- What you talkin' about, man?

675
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,600
They changed your classification.
It's in the paper.

676
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,400
- What?
- Champ. Eskridge.

677
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,840
You're 1 A.

678
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,120
They tryin' to draft me in the army?
You know about this?

679
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,360
Okay, here we go.

680
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,320
All right, all right.
Hey, I got to go.

681
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,000
They started runnin'.

682
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,200
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

683
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:46,640
You know, so I went down there,
I did everything I was supposed to do...

684
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:48,560
and I flunked
their draft board test.

685
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,560
Then without testing me again,
to see if I'm any wiser or worser...

686
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:54,960
they decide
I can go in the army?

687
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,200
- Cassius, in my opinion--
- My name ain't Cassius Clay.

688
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,720
That is a slave name,
and I am a free man.

689
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,320
I am Muhammad Ali.

690
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:06,440
You know, I apologize.
I apologize to you on the air.

691
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:08,640
Your name is Muhammad Ali.

692
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:10,760
You have a right to be called
whatever you want.

693
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,720
I apologize to you.

694
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:16,200
You sure make a lot of mistakes
for a so-called educated man.

695
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:18,600
- You really went to law school?
- Yes, Muhammad.

696
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:22,280
And to think I gave up a lucrative
practice for the likes of you.

697
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:24,240
I'm the best thing
ever happened to you, Cosell.

698
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:28,000
Without me, you'd be a tall white man
with a microphone in his mouth.

699
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:31,200
And without me,
you'd be a mouth.

700
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,680
We'll be right back.

701
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,520
- You want some food for that thing?
- How could you do such a thing?

702
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,120
- 'Cause it's funny.
- To someone you revere.

703
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,000
- That thing almost bit my finger off.
- Mr. Bundini...

704
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,120
I'm glad you were here
to witness this-- this assault.

705
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,280
Have a little coffee
with your sugar.

706
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,040
They're coming after you...

707
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:08,520
because they're scared of
black militancy in the inner cities.

708
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:14,160
I ain't no H. Rap Brown.
I ain't no Stokely Carmichael.

709
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,480
You're the heavyweight
champion of the world.

710
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,680
Here's the deal the government offered.
You do six weeks in basic.

711
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,160
You go to the reserves.
You don't go to Vietnam.

712
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,040
Now, the messenger would not object
if you joined under those terms.

713
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,840
I stay out of jail and keep boxing.

714
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:45,120
If you accept the induction,
life goes on.

715
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:59,080
Marvin Decker Anderson,
US Army.

716
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:04,160
Juan Raymondo Benitez,
US Army.

717
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,200
Pryce Marshall Benson,
US Marines.

718
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,480
Cassius Marcellus Clay,
US Army.

719
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,958
Mr. Clay,
I'm required to inform you...

720
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:32,880
that refusal to accept
a lawful induction order...

721
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,760
constitutes a felony...

722
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:39,400
under the Universal Military
Training and Service Act...

723
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:43,360
punishable by
five years imprisonment...

724
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,160
and a $10,000 fine.

725
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,760
Do you understand?

726
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,600
Yes, sir.

727
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,160
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

728
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,958
Mr. Clay, you're under arrest
for refusing induction.

729
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,440
Yeah.

730
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:55,640
Yeah, this is me.

731
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:59,280
No, you got to ask Chauncey Eskridge.
That's my lawyer. He's in Chicago.

732
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,880
No, I'm out on bail.

733
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:08,120
No, man, I ain't never
shot nothin' in my life.

734
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,958
No ducks, no geese,
no deer, no nothin'.

735
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:15,520
Yeah, I know where Vietnam is.
It's on TV.

736
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:20,640
Southeast Asia?
What, it's there too?

737
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,520
What do I think about who?

738
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,080
The Vietcong?

739
01:03:30,320 --> 01:03:33,360
Man, I ain't got no quarrel
with them Vietcong.

740
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:38,080
Ain't no Vietcong
ever called me nigger.

741
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:40,960
Yeah, that's right.

742
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:48,280
You know what you're doin', Ali?

743
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:51,240
You know what you just said?

744
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:53,840
Everyone, Europe to China,
every home in America...

745
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,880
everyone’s gonna know what the
heavyweight champion of the world...

746
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,958
said about the US war.

747
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:02,560
So what? So what?
I ain't got to be...

748
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:04,520
what nobody else
want me to be...

749
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,120
and I ain't afraid to be
what I wanna be...

750
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,120
think how I wanna think.

751
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,160
I got almost nowhere I can
promote a fight for you.

752
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:32,560
Plus I think they're gonna
vacate you from the crown.

753
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,800
- What?
- Yeah, if you're convicted.

754
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:39,480
Oh, so they're gonna take from me
what no fighter in the world can.

755
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:41,440
And New York may revoke
your boxing license.

756
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:44,360
You sure you wanna do this?

757
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:47,400
The next three to four years
are every heavyweight's prime.

758
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,240
There are few of those years.

759
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:55,880
- What about Terrell?
- We'll know about that this afternoon.

760
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:59,080
I gotta find us some venues fast.
I'll call you later.

761
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:08,840
You understand the issue is your
license to fight Terrell in Illinois?

762
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,440
Yes.

763
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,680
Then are you prepared
to apologize...

764
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,360
about your unpatriotic remarks
about the war?

765
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,958
- You say you're the people's champion.
- Yes, sir.

766
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,440
Do you think you're acting
like the people's champion?

767
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,440
Yes, sir.
I'm not gonna apologize to you.

768
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,918
This is not a courtroom, and I do not
have to answer your questions.

769
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,240
- What about Terrell?
- We'll fight in another state!

770
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,600
- Are you gonna dodge the draft?
- I ain't draft-dodgin'...

771
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,040
I ain't burnin' no flag,
and I ain't runnin' to Canada.

772
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,958
I'm stayin' right here.
You wanna send me to jail?

773
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:57,240
Fine. You go right ahead.
I've been in jail for 400 years.

774
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,160
I can be there
for four or five more.

775
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,080
But I ain't going'
no 10,000 miles...

776
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,560
to help murder and kill
other poor people.

777
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:07,760
If I wanna die, I'll die right here
right now, fightin' you, if I wanna die.

778
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:11,600
You my enemy. Not no Chinese,
no Vietcong, no Japanese.

779
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,640
You my opposer
when I want freedom.

780
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:17,280
You my opposer when I want justice.
You my opposer when I want equality.

781
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:19,000
You want me to go somewhere
and fight for you.

782
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:21,000
You won't even stand up for me
right here in America...

783
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,918
for my rights
and my religious beliefs.

784
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,200
You won't even stand up for me
right here at home.

785
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,600
- Which guy you want to go first?
- You, sir.

786
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,520
Tell Clay he gettin' on after me.
I'm the champ.

787
01:06:32,560 --> 01:06:35,320
- What?
- I said you can get on after me.

788
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,520
You will announce it from right here,
from flat on your back.

789
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:42,520
What's my name?
What's my name?

790
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:48,200
What's my name? Say my name!
You gonna say my name!

791
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:50,800
Your mama called you Clay!
I'm gonna call you Clay!

792
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,840
I want you all to tell
all their aunts...

793
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:54,800
and all their uncles
and cousins and friends...

794
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:57,240
get to your television set,
get to your radio...

795
01:06:57,320 --> 01:06:59,760
'cause I never wanted
to whup a man so bad!

796
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:15,960
What's my name?
What's my name?

797
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:13,280
What's my name, motherfucker?
What's my name?

798
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:18,080
What's my name?

799
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,240
The jury has found you guilty
of refusing induction...

800
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,480
into the United States
Armed Forces.

801
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,520
Does the defense have anything
it wants to say?

802
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,880
Yeah, I'd appreciate if the court would
just give me my sentence right now...

803
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,120
rather than waitin' and stallin'.

804
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,680
Very well.

805
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:58,640
I sentence you to
the maximum sentence allowable:

806
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,800
five years imprisonment
and a fine of $10,000.

807
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,320
Doubtless your lawyer
will lodge an appeal...

808
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:08,520
so while you're free on bond, I order
that your passport be surrendered.

809
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:13,800
I'll not have you benefiting yourself
by fighting abroad.

810
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,880
This court is adjourned.

811
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:53,880
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

812
01:09:53,880 --> 01:09:57,320
Hold on. Watch this.
I've been working on this at home.

813
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,320
Just relax.

814
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:02,640
See? 'Cause it's spooky and sometimes
people get scared and run.

815
01:10:02,680 --> 01:10:04,840
Pay attention.
This is very spooky.

816
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,640
Go ahead.
Blow on that for me.

817
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,320
See, you don't need
to fight no more.

818
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:23,440
You don't remember me, do you?

819
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:29,280
Yeah. I remember somethin'.
What's your name?

820
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:31,560
- You know my name.
- I know your name.

821
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:34,918
You came to my school
right before you won the title.

822
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:37,520
I interviewed you
for my school paper.

823
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,720
I was eleven.

824
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:43,080
You had a long braid.

825
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,040
Yeah.

826
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,880
- You called me "Little Indian Girl."
- Wow.

827
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:51,240
- Man, that was you.
- That was me.

828
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,600
And I loved you then,
just like all them kids did.

829
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,840
I never stopped.
I still do.

830
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,320
Hey, did you see
that Ellis-Quary fight?

831
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,200
Yeah.

832
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:09,200
We're gonna be in front of
the US Court of Appeals next month.

833
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:10,280
We're gonna lose.

834
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,160
- We'll appeal to the Supreme Court.
-Jimmy Ellis, the champ.

835
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,800
Man, I've been whupping on that boy
since I was 16.

836
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:18,400
All that's gonna happen,
they gonna give Ellis to Frazier...

837
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:21,000
Frazier's gonna kill him,
then what?

838
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,000
Where's the gate?
Then they got to let me fight.

839
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:29,160
Jimmy Ellis.
Fight that boy in a phone booth.

840
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:33,080
Fight him in the middle of Times Square.
You think that'd draw a crowd?

841
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:36,560
Champ, draw a crowd
or not draw a crowd...

842
01:12:36,640 --> 01:12:39,240
it's not gonna make a difference
with your boxing licenses.

843
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:45,320
The ACLU's handling your case
against the New York Boxing Commission.

844
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:48,040
They've discovered that New York's
got actual ex-murderers...

845
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,600
and ex-rapists
currently licensed to fight.

846
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,040
But revoke yours?

847
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:56,200
They don't want you to fight.

848
01:12:56,280 --> 01:12:57,560
- Tijuana.
- No.

849
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,400
State Department refuses permission
for the one-hour visa.

850
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,080
No fight in Tijuana.

851
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:06,400
Can't fight here.
Can't fight outside the country.

852
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,320
I know people
in the restaurant business.

853
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,800
They want to start a chain.
Muhammad Ali Champ Burgers.

854
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:13,120
Muhammad Malts,
Fistful of Fries.

855
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:14,960
All of that.

856
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,280
'Cause you need the money.

857
01:13:18,360 --> 01:13:21,160
- How much all this gonna cost?
- Too much.

858
01:13:22,921 --> 01:13:25,200
They do that to you too, you know.

859
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:27,160
They bust you out.

860
01:13:39,761 --> 01:13:40,721
All right.

861
01:13:44,562 --> 01:13:46,961
Go get me some
Champ Burgers.

862
01:13:56,922 --> 01:13:58,801
Did y'all see that?
That man just hit me.

863
01:13:58,843 --> 01:14:02,242
Oh, you done messed up now, sucka.
You done messed up--

864
01:14:02,323 --> 01:14:04,522
I don't wanna do nothin'
in front of your daughters, though.

865
01:14:04,563 --> 01:14:06,642
I can't beat you up
in front of your daughters.

866
01:14:06,723 --> 01:14:10,362
- Hey, champ, good to see you.
- All right, ladies. Take care now.

867
01:14:10,444 --> 01:14:12,403
All right now.
All right now.

868
01:14:22,844 --> 01:14:26,323
You called me "Little Indian Girl"
'cause I wore my hair in a braid.

869
01:14:28,604 --> 01:14:30,483
And then I said,
"Man, you scribble.

870
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,443
You can't even write.

871
01:14:33,524 --> 01:14:35,883
Need to go back to school
till you learn how to do it better."

872
01:14:35,925 --> 01:14:39,205
Now, why you just havin'
a fresh mouth talkin' to me.

873
01:14:39,285 --> 01:14:41,164
So you think that's funny, huh?

874
01:14:41,245 --> 01:14:43,924
Telling me I can't write,
that I scribble.

875
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:46,724
Now you wanna try
to make up with me.

876
01:14:46,805 --> 01:14:49,805
- This will make everything better.
- Shut up.

877
01:15:07,806 --> 01:15:10,285
Mommy and Daddy
moved to Mexico!

878
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:29,527
Come on, baby.

879
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:32,607
Oh, sweetie, come on.

880
01:15:46,409 --> 01:15:49,808
We will give you five minutes
to leave this area.

881
01:15:52,569 --> 01:15:55,048
Who is the heavyweight champion
of the world?

882
01:16:05,970 --> 01:16:07,890
What's happenin'?

883
01:16:22,211 --> 01:16:24,570
- Hey, man.
- We lost on the appellate level...

884
01:16:25,891 --> 01:16:28,610
- We’re heading to the Supreme Court.
- We already got turned down there.

885
01:16:28,692 --> 01:16:33,291
I'm petitioning on a conscientious
objection basis. Religious belief.

886
01:16:33,332 --> 01:16:36,371
I believe that they'll hear that.

887
01:16:36,452 --> 01:16:39,371
Where the money
gonna come from, Chauncey?

888
01:16:39,412 --> 01:16:42,931
Herbert say I’m runnin' on empty.
Now, just put aside...

889
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:44,691
"How did that happen?"

890
01:16:44,772 --> 01:16:49,451
License all revoked, passport gone,
can't fight here, can't fight nowhere.

891
01:16:49,492 --> 01:16:51,491
Then what happen if I lose
at the Supreme Court?

892
01:16:53,893 --> 01:16:56,092
Then you go to jail for five years.

893
01:18:08,697 --> 01:18:11,376
Oh, I saw Bundini
when I was in Europe.

894
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:15,696
- Yeah? How is he?
- He's bad. He's in bad shape, man.

895
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:18,536
You better get your belt back

896
01:18:22,538 --> 01:18:25,217
Look at this.

897
01:18:25,298 --> 01:18:27,657
Joe Frazier.
He can't up no gate.

898
01:18:27,738 --> 01:18:30,618
Can't fill no arena.
They got to let me fight.

899
01:18:30,698 --> 01:18:32,177
Fight.

900
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:40,538
If that happens, promise me you'll
put some new people around you.

901
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,018
What you talkin' about?

902
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:48,298
Where Herbert and them
when we need 'em?

903
01:18:48,379 --> 01:18:52,538
Gene Kilroy's dropping off groceries
like charity.

904
01:18:54,620 --> 01:18:57,659
We borrow money from my folks.

905
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:01,980
They're all over you when you got it,
and then they just drop off you...

906
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,700
when you don't.

907
01:19:16,581 --> 01:19:19,380
Norton, he's big and strong,
but he ain't nothin'.

908
01:19:19,461 --> 01:19:22,540
Hold on a second, Joe.
They're telling me we have a caller.

909
01:19:22,621 --> 01:19:25,820
- Go ahead, please.
- Cosell, this is Muhammad Ali.

910
01:19:25,901 --> 01:19:27,100
It's Muhammad Ali.

911
01:19:27,181 --> 01:19:29,180
Everybody knows
that I am the champ.

912
01:19:29,261 --> 01:19:32,500
The crown is a lie. I know it's a lie.
Joe Frazier knows it's a lie.

913
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:34,861
And it's time for everybody
to stop lying and tell the truth.

914
01:19:34,902 --> 01:19:38,141
Let's tell it like it is.
With your court and boxing problems...

915
01:19:38,222 --> 01:19:40,142
can you get a fight promoted?

916
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:42,341
I would fight Joe Frazier for free
in a phone booth...

917
01:19:42,422 --> 01:19:44,701
in the middle of Times Square
if I wasn't broke.

918
01:19:44,782 --> 01:19:46,861
Did you say you were broke?
How can you be broke?

919
01:19:46,942 --> 01:19:50,261
You made more money than all previous
heavyweights champions combined.

920
01:19:50,303 --> 01:19:52,742
What about your management?
Surely they have provided for you.

921
01:19:52,823 --> 01:19:55,823
All I'm trying to say is it's time
for everybody to stop lyin'.

922
01:19:55,903 --> 01:19:57,543
Muhammad Ali is the champ.

923
01:19:57,624 --> 01:20:00,543
Get my son Herbert
on the telephone.

924
01:20:00,624 --> 01:20:03,343
Muhammad, thank you for calling in.
I'll relay that to Joe.

925
01:20:03,384 --> 01:20:07,383
And tell Joe I said
he is very ugly.

926
01:20:08,743 --> 01:20:11,822
Muhammad says that he will
fight you anywhere, anytime...

927
01:20:11,903 --> 01:20:16,462
and that the championship really is his
until that battle ensues.

928
01:20:29,145 --> 01:20:32,425
Mr. Ali has sporting blood.

929
01:20:32,505 --> 01:20:35,464
Mr. Ali wants a place
in this sports world.

930
01:20:35,545 --> 01:20:38,184
He loves it too much.

931
01:20:38,265 --> 01:20:42,544
I am therefore suspending Mr. Ali
from the practice of Islam.

932
01:20:42,625 --> 01:20:46,624
He may no longer appear in temple,
pray or teach...

933
01:20:46,706 --> 01:20:51,545
or have any conversation
with any Muslim whatsoever.

934
01:20:55,067 --> 01:20:56,586
Why didn’t you call
an ambulance or a doctor?

935
01:20:56,666 --> 01:20:59,185
Because he gave me your number
when he checked in.

936
01:20:59,226 --> 01:21:01,345
Normally, he's up there
making a lot of noise.

937
01:21:01,426 --> 01:21:03,785
But now he hasn't answered the door
in three days.

938
01:21:07,107 --> 01:21:08,786
- What's that?
- It's daylight.

939
01:21:10,267 --> 01:21:12,146
Get me that short dog.

940
01:21:14,548 --> 01:21:16,787
Give it to me.

941
01:21:19,387 --> 01:21:20,466
What's wrong with you?

942
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,267
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.
My head ain't bad.

943
01:21:23,348 --> 01:21:25,187
- Leave me alone.
- Leave you alone. You called me!

944
01:21:25,268 --> 01:21:27,747
Yes, but that was a week ago.

945
01:21:27,828 --> 01:21:29,947
- Why are you shamin' yourself?
- Let me go, man.

946
01:21:30,028 --> 01:21:31,707
Why you doin' that
to yourself?

947
01:21:31,788 --> 01:21:34,388
- Why you shamin' yourself?
- Ain't nobody shamed.

948
01:21:34,429 --> 01:21:36,628
Ain't nothin' wrong with me.

949
01:21:36,668 --> 01:21:38,427
I'm flyin'.

950
01:21:38,509 --> 01:21:40,508
The Sky Chief talk through me.
I know the word.

951
01:21:40,589 --> 01:21:41,908
- You know low.
- Yeah?

952
01:21:41,949 --> 01:21:44,108
I know low where the king
is goin' back to his throne!

953
01:21:44,189 --> 01:21:46,868
- From the root to the fruit!
- Them rhymes is old, Bundini.

954
01:21:46,909 --> 01:21:48,788
You need to get some new ones.

955
01:21:52,510 --> 01:21:56,190
God don't care about you.
Don't care about me.

956
01:21:56,270 --> 01:21:59,349
In all of everything, we don't mean
nothin'. He don't owe us.

957
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,070
We be.

958
01:22:01,150 --> 01:22:04,309
And that's the onliest thing He did.

959
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:07,349
But that's good.
That's why we free.

960
01:22:07,391 --> 01:22:11,071
But free ain't easy. Free is real
and real is a motherfucker.

961
01:22:13,231 --> 01:22:15,870
It eats raw meat.

962
01:22:15,951 --> 01:22:18,390
It walk in its own shoes.

963
01:22:20,911 --> 01:22:22,310
Yeah.

964
01:22:28,032 --> 01:22:30,791
I-- I sold your belt.

965
01:22:32,112 --> 01:22:34,951
I sold your belt to a barber
for $500 on Lenox Avenue.

966
01:22:35,032 --> 01:22:38,391
That's how low I did you.
I couldn't help it. I got a crazy mind.

967
01:22:40,592 --> 01:22:42,631
That belt say you the heavyweight
boxing champion of the world...

968
01:22:42,712 --> 01:22:45,511
and I took that $500...

969
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:47,913
and I put it in my arm.

970
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:51,632
That's what I called to tell you.

971
01:22:58,593 --> 01:23:01,752
I heard about the Nation stuff,
the courtroom.

972
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:05,473
What you gonna do?

973
01:23:16,034 --> 01:23:17,793
Take me back.

974
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:28,914
I could go down there and get the belt.
I can go get the belt.

975
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,997
Hey, champ.

976
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:46,880
$1,000 to the man that bring me
Howard Cosell's toupee dead or alive!

977
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,440
Don't bother me.
I'm a world-famous sportscaster...

978
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:51,680
and you're an ex-champion
with diminished skills.

979
01:24:51,760 --> 01:24:53,440
I can't be seen with you.

980
01:24:56,680 --> 01:24:59,360
- How's it goin', champ?
- Pretty good, man.

981
01:25:04,881 --> 01:25:08,080
Muhammad, I'd do anything for you.
You know that.

982
01:25:08,161 --> 01:25:13,400
But I've got bosses who only
give a damn about Nielsen ratings.

983
01:25:13,481 --> 01:25:16,000
I guarantee...

984
01:25:16,081 --> 01:25:19,720
it will be a historical
and a momentous night.

985
01:25:25,522 --> 01:25:28,802
If they came to me tomorrow and say,
"We want you to fight Joe Frazier.

986
01:25:28,842 --> 01:25:31,722
Madison Square Garden.
Millions and millions of dollars.

987
01:25:31,762 --> 01:25:34,241
Here's your license back."
I will tell them...

988
01:25:34,322 --> 01:25:36,001
"I will never fight again."

989
01:25:36,082 --> 01:25:39,401
Frankly, Muhammad, I'm surprised,
because unless you--

990
01:25:39,443 --> 01:25:41,802
or until you fight Frazier--

991
01:25:41,883 --> 01:25:45,682
Cosell, are you losin' your hearing
along with your hair?

992
01:25:45,763 --> 01:25:48,682
Don't put no question to it, man.
I done told you, I'm through fightin'.

993
01:25:48,763 --> 01:25:51,042
I got a much bigger contender,
a much heavier opponent.

994
01:25:51,123 --> 01:25:52,962
I'm fightin'
the entire US government.

995
01:25:54,163 --> 01:25:56,562
Do you think
you're going to jail?

996
01:25:56,643 --> 01:25:59,202
I don't know. I don't know.

997
01:25:59,243 --> 01:26:04,642
Joe Frazier told me on this show
that he could knock you out.

998
01:26:04,684 --> 01:26:06,883
See, there you go agitatin'.

999
01:26:06,924 --> 01:26:10,643
You should've asked Smokin' Joe
what have he been smokin'?

1000
01:26:10,725 --> 01:26:14,324
That boy even dream he whupped me,
he better wake up and apologize.

1001
01:26:14,405 --> 01:26:16,364
If I was to get in the ring with Joe...

1002
01:26:16,445 --> 01:26:18,284
here's what you might see.

1003
01:26:18,365 --> 01:26:22,885
Ali comes out to meet Frazier,
but Frazier starts to retreat.

1004
01:26:22,925 --> 01:26:27,004
If Joe goes back an inch farther,
he'll wind up in a ringside seat.

1005
01:26:27,085 --> 01:26:30,085
Ali swings with his left,
Ali swings with his right.

1006
01:26:30,166 --> 01:26:32,245
Just look at the kid
carry the fight.

1007
01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:34,804
Frazier keeps backin',
but there's not enough room.

1008
01:26:38,286 --> 01:26:40,965
Ali swings with his right.
What a beautiful swing.

1009
01:26:41,046 --> 01:26:43,845
But the punch lifts Frazier
clean out of the ring.

1010
01:26:43,886 --> 01:26:46,565
Frazier's still risin',
and the referee wears a frown...

1011
01:26:46,647 --> 01:26:49,886
'cause he can't start countin'
till Frazier comes down.

1012
01:26:49,966 --> 01:26:53,165
Frazier's disappeared from view.
The crowd is getting frantic.

1013
01:26:53,247 --> 01:26:57,046
But our radar stations picked him up.
He's somewhere over the Atlantic.

1014
01:26:57,127 --> 01:26:59,286
Now, who would've thought
when they came to the fight...

1015
01:26:59,367 --> 01:27:03,166
they was gonna witness the launchin'
of a black satellite.

1016
01:27:03,248 --> 01:27:05,647
But don't wait for that fight.

1017
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,807
It ain't never gonna happen.

1018
01:27:07,888 --> 01:27:09,887
Only thing you could do...

1019
01:27:09,968 --> 01:27:13,327
is wonder and imagine.

1020
01:27:13,888 --> 01:27:19,488
This has been another
sports exclusive from ABC.

1021
01:27:19,569 --> 01:27:21,489
- Two. Go two.
- Over to Jim McKay...

1022
01:27:21,568 --> 01:27:23,727
in Bern, Switzerland.

1023
01:27:23,809 --> 01:27:25,928
- How you gonna go from me to Jim McKay?
- Listen, uh--

1024
01:27:27,089 --> 01:27:30,608
- Did your wife leave you yet?
- No, she hasn't left me yet.

1025
01:27:30,689 --> 01:27:32,928
She's going to, 'cause I
told your wife when I seen her...

1026
01:27:33,009 --> 01:27:36,128
I said, "Listen, why you
doin' this to yourself?"

1027
01:27:44,890 --> 01:27:48,329
Oh, man, Joe.
Who dresses you?

1028
01:27:48,409 --> 01:27:51,168
You look like the heavyweight
champion of pimps.

1029
01:27:51,250 --> 01:27:53,209
Hey, shut up and get in.

1030
01:27:54,450 --> 01:27:55,929
That jacket’s a mess, man.

1031
01:28:00,051 --> 01:28:02,450
What you in Philly for?
Philly's my town.

1032
01:28:02,530 --> 01:28:05,410
Well, I just wanted to get
a little closer to you, honey.

1033
01:28:05,491 --> 01:28:06,451
Man, fuck you.

1034
01:28:08,691 --> 01:28:12,010
There'll be two undefeated heavyweight
champions, and they ain't fightin'.

1035
01:28:12,051 --> 01:28:14,651
- What about your license?
- I can fight in Atlanta.

1036
01:28:14,732 --> 01:28:17,291
There ain't no state boxing commission
in Georgia.

1037
01:28:17,332 --> 01:28:20,491
It's all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta
against Jerry Quary...

1038
01:28:20,531 --> 01:28:23,050
but we got to get this
steamroller movin' right now.

1039
01:28:23,092 --> 01:28:24,651
So what do I have to do?

1040
01:28:24,692 --> 01:28:27,972
All you got to do is announce
that after I whup Jerry Quary...

1041
01:28:28,052 --> 01:28:30,451
you gonna give me a title shot.

1042
01:28:30,532 --> 01:28:33,051
Come on, man.
Say it! Say it!

1043
01:28:41,453 --> 01:28:44,812
What I got and all I got,
I got with these right here.

1044
01:28:44,893 --> 01:28:47,052
Hell, man, I already got the title.

1045
01:28:47,133 --> 01:28:51,493
So I ain't got nothin' to win,
but I got everythin' to lose.

1046
01:28:53,013 --> 01:28:55,292
Yeah, but you know
you ain't the real champ yet.

1047
01:29:04,054 --> 01:29:06,093
You beat Quary...

1048
01:29:06,134 --> 01:29:09,134
I'm gonna get you in the ring.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

1049
01:29:19,615 --> 01:29:21,894
By the way...

1050
01:29:21,975 --> 01:29:26,174
you need any money
or anything to tide you by?

1051
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,375
No, I'm fine.

1052
01:29:43,696 --> 01:29:46,055
Time!

1053
01:29:53,297 --> 01:29:55,816
What you want?

1054
01:29:58,257 --> 01:30:00,136
Take me back, boss.

1055
01:30:01,818 --> 01:30:03,657
I'm clean.

1056
01:30:03,738 --> 01:30:07,937
This is a resurrection.
This is God's act.

1057
01:30:08,018 --> 01:30:11,057
And the prophet is goin' home.

1058
01:30:11,138 --> 01:30:13,377
Take me with you, boss.

1059
01:30:14,378 --> 01:30:16,377
I'll do anything.

1060
01:30:26,459 --> 01:30:30,178
Your hands can't hit
what your eyes can't see.

1061
01:30:33,059 --> 01:30:36,739
Float like a butterfly,
sting like a bee.

1062
01:30:36,820 --> 01:30:39,140
Rumble, young man, rumble.

1063
01:30:56,941 --> 01:31:00,340
God ain't watching'!
Ain't nobody but us!

1064
01:31:07,181 --> 01:31:09,900
There it is!
Stay in his face!

1065
01:31:13,621 --> 01:31:15,380
Go, Muhammad!

1066
01:31:26,422 --> 01:31:27,701
There it is!

1067
01:31:33,662 --> 01:31:35,181
Now for the right. Boom!

1068
01:31:41,303 --> 01:31:43,182
Prophet is goin' home
to the throne.

1069
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:01,423
That's how you do it, Ali.

1070
01:32:01,504 --> 01:32:03,663
That's how you do it.

1071
01:32:10,465 --> 01:32:12,944
You okay?
You're a goddamn Superman.

1072
01:32:13,025 --> 01:32:15,184
Ain't no kryptonite
in this ring tonight.

1073
01:32:57,747 --> 01:32:59,866
- We want Joe Frazier!
- We want him!

1074
01:32:59,947 --> 01:33:04,307
- We want Joe Frazier!
- And you deserve it. You deserve it.

1075
01:33:07,868 --> 01:33:10,787
This prophet is comin' home,
goin' from the darkness to the light.

1076
01:33:13,469 --> 01:33:15,628
Soak it in this
for about 20 minutes.

1077
01:33:17,668 --> 01:33:20,387
We don't need their management.

1078
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:24,548
Hey, Herbert, we did good.
Doin' good tonight.

1079
01:33:35,749 --> 01:33:37,428
All praise to Allah.

1080
01:33:40,830 --> 01:33:43,269
The messenger has lifted
your suspension.

1081
01:33:43,350 --> 01:33:45,189
Congratulations.

1082
01:33:45,270 --> 01:33:47,190
So you’re sayin'
I can be a Muslim again.

1083
01:33:47,270 --> 01:33:48,789
- Yes.
- I ain't never stopped.

1084
01:33:48,871 --> 01:33:50,750
Just like I ain't never stopped
bein' the champ.

1085
01:33:52,870 --> 01:33:54,469
I begged my father
to reinstate you.

1086
01:33:54,550 --> 01:33:57,229
When? When you do that, Herbert?

1087
01:33:57,311 --> 01:33:59,631
After I promoted this Quary fight
or after I won it?

1088
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:02,510
- We can get Frazier.
- Man, I done already got Frazier.

1089
01:34:02,592 --> 01:34:04,951
We can get $5 million for Frazier.

1090
01:34:05,031 --> 01:34:08,031
We talkin' management,
talkin' money or talkin' religion?

1091
01:34:08,072 --> 01:34:10,952
When I got leery
and talked up why I'm broke...

1092
01:34:11,032 --> 01:34:12,511
then come the suspension.

1093
01:34:12,592 --> 01:34:15,991
Now you explain that one to me,
my brother.

1094
01:34:16,072 --> 01:34:18,151
That was my father.

1095
01:34:20,592 --> 01:34:22,471
Your father.

1096
01:34:22,512 --> 01:34:26,472
I love your father, Herbert.
I swear, man. I love the Nation.

1097
01:34:26,553 --> 01:34:28,912
But it don't own me.

1098
01:34:37,673 --> 01:34:40,312
You go on out there
and you make that Frazier deal.

1099
01:34:45,354 --> 01:34:47,193
My brother.
Yeah, your brother Herbert.

1100
01:34:47,274 --> 01:34:49,073
Go on somewhere,
make that deal.

1101
01:34:59,235 --> 01:35:02,394
And he accepts me.
I’m Jewish, but yet he's Muslim...

1102
01:35:02,475 --> 01:35:03,874
and we still get along.

1103
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:07,313
He understands me. He understands me
and he still allows me to hang with him.

1104
01:35:07,395 --> 01:35:10,714
He knows I like pork and white women,
but still allows me to be here with him.

1105
01:35:10,795 --> 01:35:12,674
Now, I can give up pork...

1106
01:35:12,715 --> 01:35:15,394
but them white women,
goddamn it!

1107
01:35:15,475 --> 01:35:17,434
How you deal with it, boy?

1108
01:35:30,756 --> 01:35:33,915
Hello?
Muhammad, it's for you.

1109
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:40,316
Thank you, Lana.

1110
01:35:40,397 --> 01:35:43,397
- Yeah?
- Muhammad? Howard Cosell.

1111
01:35:43,436 --> 01:35:46,915
- You TKO'd them.
- Hey, what you talkin' about, Howard?

1112
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:48,917
- With Quary?
- No.

1113
01:35:48,997 --> 01:35:50,836
The Supreme Court ruled today...

1114
01:35:50,917 --> 01:35:54,116
in the case of The United States
vs. Cassius Clay...

1115
01:35:54,157 --> 01:35:57,796
aka Muhammad Ali.

1116
01:35:57,880 --> 01:36:01,677
You won an eight-to-zero
unanimous decision.

1117
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:04,437
You're free.

1118
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,397
Congratulations.

1119
01:36:22,120 --> 01:36:23,520
I'm free.

1120
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,040
The Supreme Court
just set me free.

1121
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:38,080
What are you talkin' about?

1122
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:40,800
Eight-to-oh, unanimous decision.

1123
01:36:40,880 --> 01:36:43,480
The Supreme Court
just overturned my conviction.

1124
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:47,800
- Yes!
- All right. All right.

1125
01:36:47,881 --> 01:36:49,280
- Did we get 'em, Ali?
- We got 'em, man.

1126
01:36:51,121 --> 01:36:53,160
Hey, man.

1127
01:36:54,480 --> 01:36:57,760
- Did we do it?
- We did it, man.

1128
01:36:57,841 --> 01:37:01,160
They wanna be on your side now because
the truth has shown itself to the power.

1129
01:37:01,241 --> 01:37:03,960
Now the power's comin' to the truth.
That's what it is.

1130
01:37:04,042 --> 01:37:06,362
And the truth tastes good
when there's a belly full of lies.

1131
01:37:06,441 --> 01:37:09,441
- What you talkin' about?
- It don't matter. It don't matter.

1132
01:37:17,882 --> 01:37:20,482
Ladies and gentlemen,
15 rounds of boxing...

1133
01:37:20,562 --> 01:37:25,082
for the undisputed heavyweight
championship of the world.

1134
01:37:25,163 --> 01:37:29,842
In this corner, the contender and former
heavyweight champion of the world...

1135
01:37:29,923 --> 01:37:33,922
weighing in at 213 pounds...

1136
01:37:34,003 --> 01:37:37,683
with a record of31 and 0
with 25 knockouts...

1137
01:37:37,763 --> 01:37:40,322
Muhammad Ali!

1138
01:37:45,523 --> 01:37:50,043
His opponent,
weighing in at 2051/2 pounds...

1139
01:37:50,124 --> 01:37:54,084
with a record of26 and 0
with 23 knockouts...

1140
01:37:54,164 --> 01:37:57,563
the current heavyweight
champion of the world...

1141
01:37:57,644 --> 01:38:01,723
Smokin' Joe Frazier!

1142
01:38:03,685 --> 01:38:06,965
I want a good, clean fight.
Protect your self at all times.

1143
01:38:07,045 --> 01:38:10,124
Gentlemen, touch gloves.
Good luck to both of you.

1144
01:38:47,367 --> 01:38:48,486
Come on!

1145
01:38:48,568 --> 01:38:50,488
Stick him! Come on!

1146
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:33,369
That's okay, champ.
Don't stop fightin'.

1147
01:39:35,370 --> 01:39:36,609
What's comin'?

1148
01:39:36,690 --> 01:39:39,889
Lean back, man.
Move back. Work, legs.

1149
01:39:51,931 --> 01:39:53,090
Ain't nobody hurt.

1150
01:39:53,171 --> 01:39:55,530
That's all right.
Ain't no--

1151
01:40:12,732 --> 01:40:14,051
Keep puttin' out.
Come on.

1152
01:40:25,373 --> 01:40:28,052
- Move, Ali!
- Back, back, back!

1153
01:41:00,014 --> 01:41:01,853
Muhammad, you said
you were gonna win the fight.

1154
01:41:01,934 --> 01:41:03,854
How do you account
for the beating you've taken?

1155
01:41:03,935 --> 01:41:06,535
- Did he hurt you?
-Joe said you don't wanna fight again.

1156
01:41:06,615 --> 01:41:09,054
Oh, how wrong he is.

1157
01:41:09,135 --> 01:41:10,614
- Why would it be different?
- Muhammad, wait!

1158
01:41:15,496 --> 01:41:18,655
- But I wanna ask him something!
- We all wanna ask him something.

1159
01:41:18,736 --> 01:41:21,215
- Sons of bitches! Get outta here!
- When are you gonna get a hairpiece?

1160
01:41:21,296 --> 01:41:23,216
Don't worry about it.
You lost all of yours.

1161
01:41:23,296 --> 01:41:25,175
You cue ball head motherfucker.
Get outta here!

1162
01:41:25,216 --> 01:41:27,495
-Just one more question.
- Let me talk to him.

1163
01:41:27,577 --> 01:41:29,736
We're close to the start
of round one.

1164
01:41:29,816 --> 01:41:31,575
Now that Smokin' Joe
done run outta tomato cans...

1165
01:41:31,657 --> 01:41:35,096
I got Yank to commit to a rematch
with you in about six months.

1166
01:41:35,136 --> 01:41:37,255
Frazier said he'd be happy
with three mil.

1167
01:41:37,337 --> 01:41:41,577
I'll fly to Jamaica, get Yank to sign
right after Joe beats this big stiff.

1168
01:41:42,977 --> 01:41:45,416
I think he hurt Joe Frazier.

1169
01:41:45,498 --> 01:41:48,057
I think Joe is hurt.

1170
01:41:48,098 --> 01:41:51,537
Down goes Frazier!
Down goes Frazier!

1171
01:41:53,377 --> 01:41:56,816
The heavy weight champion is
taking the mandatory eight count...

1172
01:41:56,898 --> 01:41:59,737
and Foreman
is poised as can be.

1173
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:06,258
And Frazier is down again!

1174
01:42:06,339 --> 01:42:08,778
He maybe--
No, he's rising.

1175
01:42:10,619 --> 01:42:11,898
It's over! It is over!

1176
01:42:11,939 --> 01:42:15,138
It'd be easy to get a fight
with Frazier now.

1177
01:42:15,219 --> 01:42:19,298
Only thing he's champion of
is gettin' knocked down.

1178
01:42:19,379 --> 01:42:23,178
George Foreman is
the heavyweight champion of the world.

1179
01:42:24,900 --> 01:42:28,699
The Rumble in the Jungle.
That is the name that I've given it.

1180
01:42:28,780 --> 01:42:33,140
Muhammad Ali and George Foreman
in Kinshasa, Zaire.

1181
01:42:33,220 --> 01:42:35,140
- Don, Zaire?
- Yeah, Don.

1182
01:42:35,220 --> 01:42:37,499
I mean, why not Antarctica,
somethin' like that?

1183
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:39,579
What's wrong with New York City?

1184
01:42:41,380 --> 01:42:43,339
Because you miss the significance.

1185
01:42:43,421 --> 01:42:47,460
See, I dream of overcoming
400 years of racial depression...

1186
01:42:47,541 --> 01:42:51,580
to the dawn of a new day of liberation,
financial and otherwise.

1187
01:42:51,662 --> 01:42:54,662
It will raise up the spirits
of our inner cities.

1188
01:42:54,741 --> 01:42:57,140
It will rise up and fill with hope,
the souls...

1189
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:59,700
the unrequited needs
of the black proletariat.

1190
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:02,500
That is, the discouraged, dispirited,
denigrated denizens...

1191
01:43:02,582 --> 01:43:05,462
of the demimonde
that is called the ghetto.

1192
01:43:05,542 --> 01:43:08,221
Man, Don, you crazy.

1193
01:43:08,263 --> 01:43:12,062
You must've studied the whole
"D" section of the dictionary.

1194
01:43:35,664 --> 01:43:37,503
Good morning, sister.

1195
01:43:39,864 --> 01:43:41,463
Hi, brother.

1196
01:43:43,384 --> 01:43:45,183
How you doin', champ?

1197
01:44:11,265 --> 01:44:13,264
Why they saying that?
What they sayin'?

1198
01:44:17,426 --> 01:44:19,425
What that mean?
I don't understand.

1199
01:44:19,506 --> 01:44:20,985
- It means--
- What?

1200
01:44:21,066 --> 01:44:24,346
It mean, "Ali, kill him.
Ali, kill him."

1201
01:45:09,029 --> 01:45:11,668
The champ is here!

1202
01:45:11,749 --> 01:45:15,388
Ladies and gentlemen, the heavyweight
champion of the world has arrived!

1203
01:45:16,910 --> 01:45:18,869
The champ is here!

1204
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:25,789
Hey, man.

1205
01:45:25,870 --> 01:45:27,909
He's quite younger than you.
How you feeling about that?

1206
01:45:27,990 --> 01:45:30,549
He's quite younger than me?
Well, we quite younger than you.

1207
01:45:30,631 --> 01:45:34,910
What you talkin' about? Thirty-two
years old. Best shape of my life.

1208
01:46:29,994 --> 01:46:32,513
Hey, stop!
All right, back up.

1209
01:46:39,034 --> 01:46:42,153
Did you see Muhammad Ali?

1210
01:50:51,688 --> 01:50:55,087
- Here's your water.
- Oh, thank you, hon.

1211
01:50:55,169 --> 01:50:58,449
Bottled water.
Frozen steaks.

1212
01:50:58,529 --> 01:51:01,048
Brought all that stuff in
like Africa's ain't got no steaks.

1213
01:51:01,129 --> 01:51:04,888
- You could pick up parasites.
- Mobutu eats it.

1214
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:07,409
Mobutu's takin' care of Mobutu.

1215
01:51:07,489 --> 01:51:10,008
He steals all the wealth
and sends it to Switzerland.

1216
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:13,609
What that got to do
with any of why we here?

1217
01:51:13,690 --> 01:51:18,849
We are here 'cause Don King
got Mobutu to put up $10 million.

1218
01:51:18,930 --> 01:51:22,569
Don King don't care about Africa.
He's worse than Herbert.

1219
01:51:23,250 --> 01:51:25,529
Here come Herbert.

1220
01:51:25,611 --> 01:51:28,211
And Don King fit right in too.

1221
01:51:28,290 --> 01:51:30,489
Now he's a dashiki-wearin' rip-off.

1222
01:51:30,571 --> 01:51:32,491
Don King delivered the first-ever...

1223
01:51:32,571 --> 01:51:34,730
black-promoted
championship fight in Africa.

1224
01:51:34,811 --> 01:51:38,570
Don King talks black,
lives white and thinks green.

1225
01:51:38,651 --> 01:51:40,890
And you're defending him
and Brother Herbert?

1226
01:51:40,931 --> 01:51:43,770
'Cause clean-cut Muslims in a parade
on the South Side of Chicago...

1227
01:51:43,811 --> 01:51:46,770
ain't gonna get this done!

1228
01:51:47,611 --> 01:51:50,370
I got to put honkies with connections
and bad-ass niggas to it.

1229
01:51:50,452 --> 01:51:52,291
And now they matched you up
against George Foreman.

1230
01:51:52,372 --> 01:51:55,211
Do you think they give a damn
if you get killed?

1231
01:52:01,293 --> 01:52:03,252
So that's what you think?

1232
01:52:12,133 --> 01:52:15,013
I just wanna know why
my Muslim husband...

1233
01:52:15,093 --> 01:52:18,012
is allowing himself
to get strung up on a cross.

1234
01:52:18,093 --> 01:52:20,013
Just tell me why.

1235
01:52:28,014 --> 01:52:29,613
Mayum's sick.

1236
01:52:34,814 --> 01:52:37,613
Maybe I ought to go back
to Chicago and look after her?

1237
01:52:40,414 --> 01:52:41,813
Sure.

1238
01:52:48,335 --> 01:52:50,854
Well, then I guess
I'll be back before the fight.

1239
01:52:52,335 --> 01:52:54,614
If that’s all right, my husband.

1240
01:53:19,657 --> 01:53:21,536
This fight is no contest!

1241
01:53:21,617 --> 01:53:23,496
He is entirely too slow to fight me.

1242
01:53:23,577 --> 01:53:25,976
I say that George Foreman
is a mummy.

1243
01:53:26,058 --> 01:53:28,817
He's too slow.
You know I name all my fighters.

1244
01:53:28,897 --> 01:53:30,976
I'm gonna call George Foreman
"The Mummy."

1245
01:53:31,017 --> 01:53:33,176
He fight like a mummy.

1246
01:53:36,858 --> 01:53:39,577
And when I see George throwin' punches,
this is what I hear:

1247
01:53:39,657 --> 01:53:41,936
Here come the left.

1248
01:53:42,018 --> 01:53:44,177
Here come the right.

1249
01:53:44,258 --> 01:53:46,817
But the mummy can't hit
what the mummy can't see...

1250
01:53:46,899 --> 01:53:48,698
'cause I'm too fast for him.

1251
01:53:50,219 --> 01:53:52,898
I'm too fast.

1252
01:53:52,978 --> 01:53:56,777
I'm too fast. I'm too fast.
I move too good for him.

1253
01:53:56,859 --> 01:53:59,739
I'll hit George Foreman so many times,
he'll think he's surrounded.

1254
01:54:00,939 --> 01:54:04,219
He gonna say, "Call the police!
It's five of 'em in here!"

1255
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:07,939
I'm bad, man. I'm bad!

1256
01:54:07,980 --> 01:54:11,699
Muhammad, I'm sorry.
I have to ask.

1257
01:54:12,340 --> 01:54:14,299
Are you really
fast enough anymore...

1258
01:54:14,380 --> 01:54:16,539
to beat George Foreman?

1259
01:54:16,580 --> 01:54:21,220
If he gets you against the ropes,
he can knock you out with either hand.

1260
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:25,699
Many people believe you’re not the man
you used to be ten years ago.

1261
01:54:28,621 --> 01:54:30,261
See, now, Howard...

1262
01:54:30,341 --> 01:54:33,540
I didn't even want to talk
about this, man.

1263
01:54:34,981 --> 01:54:38,620
Especially not out here
in front of all these people.

1264
01:54:38,661 --> 01:54:41,220
But I talked to your wife...

1265
01:54:41,301 --> 01:54:45,380
and she said you not the man
you used to be two years ago!

1266
01:55:06,943 --> 01:55:08,822
Champ.

1267
01:55:12,743 --> 01:55:15,542
- Champ, George had an accident.
- He-- He had what?

1268
01:55:15,624 --> 01:55:18,303
- What are you talking about?
- He got cut right above his right eye.

1269
01:55:18,384 --> 01:55:20,783
His sparring partner's elbow
split it open.

1270
01:55:20,864 --> 01:55:23,263
- Can he fight?
- Not for six weeks.

1271
01:55:25,143 --> 01:55:27,142
This is not a humorous situation,
my champ.

1272
01:55:27,224 --> 01:55:30,703
This postponement could be long,
especially if George leaves.

1273
01:55:30,784 --> 01:55:32,903
You tying to
pull something here, Don?

1274
01:55:32,984 --> 01:55:35,543
If George leaves, he ain't comin' back.
George don't like it here.

1275
01:55:36,585 --> 01:55:40,064
How right you are, my suspicious
and short Italian brother.

1276
01:55:40,104 --> 01:55:42,743
Look here, man,
my fiduciary responsibility...

1277
01:55:42,825 --> 01:55:45,145
to this first all-black promotion...

1278
01:55:45,225 --> 01:55:48,584
is analogous to a garden in the African
sun-- it must grow, it must bloom.

1279
01:55:48,665 --> 01:55:52,905
Cannot flower in the gloom and shade
of postponement to the Astrodome...

1280
01:55:52,946 --> 01:55:55,625
or any dome out of Zaire where it be
deprivileged of light and bled of water.

1281
01:55:55,666 --> 01:55:59,185
'Cause what gonna be bleedin' out of
there is money-- a hemorrhage of cash.

1282
01:55:59,266 --> 01:56:01,105
I'm talkin' about blood on the floor.

1283
01:56:01,186 --> 01:56:04,545
Double hotel costs, airplane,
travel costs, food and beverage.

1284
01:56:04,627 --> 01:56:08,346
- So what do you want us to do?
- Muhammad Ali. The people's champion.

1285
01:56:08,426 --> 01:56:09,625
My black brother.

1286
01:56:09,707 --> 01:56:12,386
I need you.
I need your strength.

1287
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:15,585
I need you to find a way
to get George to stay.

1288
01:56:15,626 --> 01:56:17,946
Be Moses in reverse.

1289
01:56:18,027 --> 01:56:21,946
Do not let my people go.
Keep them the fuck right here in Egypt.

1290
01:56:22,027 --> 01:56:24,186
- If you’ll pardon my Swahili.
- Lingala.

1291
01:56:24,267 --> 01:56:26,466
- Say what?
- They speak Lingala.

1292
01:56:27,508 --> 01:56:30,747
Ali wants his title,
and he wants it in Zaire.

1293
01:56:34,548 --> 01:56:37,148
Okay, all right, okay.
Let's take it back.

1294
01:56:37,228 --> 01:56:40,267
George go, George go.
Hell, I can get you Joe Frazier.

1295
01:56:40,348 --> 01:56:43,307
Ali-Frazier 3.
That's the fight everybody want to see.

1296
01:56:43,388 --> 01:56:47,147
- We don't want Frazier, we want George.
- Hell, I don't control George Foreman.

1297
01:57:32,471 --> 01:57:34,190
The truth is...

1298
01:57:34,271 --> 01:57:35,950
George knocked his self out.

1299
01:57:36,952 --> 01:57:38,351
That's right.

1300
01:57:38,391 --> 01:57:41,350
He did three rounds, realized
he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali...

1301
01:57:41,391 --> 01:57:42,790
and knocked his self out.

1302
01:57:43,752 --> 01:57:46,391
I predict that when the fight is set,
he might not show.

1303
01:57:46,472 --> 01:57:47,551
Oh, you bad.

1304
01:57:47,632 --> 01:57:50,471
- That's right, I'm a bad man.
- Ain't no doubt about that.

1305
01:57:50,552 --> 01:57:52,751
Yeah, but you tell George
the same thing.

1306
01:57:52,833 --> 01:57:54,672
I heard you.
I been watching you.

1307
01:57:54,753 --> 01:57:58,593
I know he's your man, I know you got
him picked, but the man is in trouble.

1308
01:57:58,672 --> 01:58:01,591
The whole world was gonna know,
but now he ain't gonna show.

1309
01:58:02,352 --> 01:58:05,391
In order to ensure that George is ready,
we are thinking of postponing...

1310
01:58:05,433 --> 01:58:08,272
from September 24 to October 30.

1311
01:58:08,354 --> 01:58:10,233
What about the concert?

1312
01:58:10,313 --> 01:58:14,592
The concert will go on as planned.
Those dates are September 20, 21 --

1313
01:58:14,674 --> 01:58:18,793
I want all the helicopters guarded,
all the private planes, private boats.

1314
01:58:18,834 --> 01:58:20,713
I'm serious.
I want the airports--

1315
01:58:20,754 --> 01:58:22,873
I want President Mobutu
and all his paratroopers--

1316
01:58:22,954 --> 01:58:25,593
All you Zaireans,
y'all be on guard too.

1317
01:58:25,674 --> 01:58:29,153
Any strange boats creeping away,
they might be taking him out.

1318
01:58:29,234 --> 01:58:30,553
Bus stations.

1319
01:58:30,634 --> 01:58:32,073
And bus stations!

1320
01:58:32,114 --> 01:58:33,993
Right.
Watch the bus stations.

1321
01:58:34,034 --> 01:58:37,353
The elephant caravans-- They might be
tying to take him out on an elephant.

1322
01:58:37,435 --> 01:58:39,755
- What'd you say?
- Hell, I ain't talking to you.

1323
01:58:39,795 --> 01:58:41,354
Hey. Hey, man.

1324
01:58:42,395 --> 01:58:44,474
Don't you never talk
to Angelo like that.

1325
01:58:44,556 --> 01:58:48,075
Don't you never talk to Angie
like that again.

1326
01:58:48,116 --> 01:58:49,875
Something wrong with you, man?

1327
01:58:51,436 --> 01:58:54,716
Think you callin' some shots here?
You ain't callin' nothin'.

1328
01:58:56,636 --> 01:58:58,915
They all know.

1329
01:58:58,996 --> 01:59:01,835
All them ladies out there,
they know I'm ready.

1330
01:59:01,876 --> 01:59:04,955
I see fear in the eyes
of his followers.

1331
01:59:05,036 --> 01:59:08,515
This was supposed to be the fight
that Muhammad Ali was ended.

1332
01:59:08,596 --> 01:59:13,116
Supposed to be Muhammad was gonna fall.
Supposed to be my destruction.

1333
01:59:13,197 --> 01:59:15,596
Well, they miscalculated.
They misjudged.

1334
01:59:15,677 --> 01:59:17,236
They got it wrong.

1335
01:59:39,320 --> 01:59:40,997
Hold on a second.

1336
01:59:42,200 --> 01:59:43,277
What's your name?

1337
01:59:44,720 --> 01:59:45,840
Veronica Porche.

1338
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:47,760
Porche. Like the sports car.

1339
01:59:47,800 --> 01:59:50,640
- Yes.
- With just a little something extra.

1340
01:59:50,680 --> 01:59:52,120
Hey, you with Don?

1341
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,800
Don brought me here,
but I'm not with anybody, no.

1342
01:59:56,880 --> 01:59:59,160
- Where you come from?
- LA.

1343
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:01,480
- LA?
- But my people are from Louisiana.

1344
02:00:01,560 --> 02:00:02,840
Louisiana.

1345
02:00:02,920 --> 02:00:04,800
What, you Creole?

1346
02:00:04,880 --> 02:00:09,720
We're Creole,
so I'm African, French and Spanish.

1347
02:00:09,800 --> 02:00:11,760
My mother's grandfather was Jewish.

1348
02:00:12,440 --> 02:00:15,600
Well, they mixed all that stuff up
in there real nice.

1349
02:00:15,641 --> 02:00:18,400
I'm the only witch doctor here.
Bundini Brown.

1350
02:00:18,481 --> 02:00:20,600
Bundini Brown
is an authentic witch doctor.

1351
02:00:20,681 --> 02:00:23,480
- You tell 'em.
- The only one in the United States.

1352
02:00:25,041 --> 02:00:28,280
I'm real glad
you said what you did.

1353
02:00:28,321 --> 02:00:31,480
You made sure the fight stays here.

1354
02:00:34,521 --> 02:00:37,480
You know all them reporters
and writers in there...

1355
02:00:38,721 --> 02:00:41,080
they say George

1356
02:00:42,122 --> 02:00:43,441
What you think?

1357
02:00:47,322 --> 02:00:49,242
Mr. Ali? Mr. Ali?

1358
02:00:49,322 --> 02:00:51,321
- We want thank you.
- Hey, fella.

1359
02:00:51,402 --> 02:00:53,201
Y'all wanna thank me?

1360
02:00:54,362 --> 02:00:56,441
Y'all gonna thank me?
What I did?

1361
02:00:59,323 --> 02:01:01,722
They thanking me for something.

1362
02:01:01,803 --> 02:01:05,882
Hey, you ever been down to Hong Kong?
Thailand? Taiwan?

1363
02:01:05,963 --> 02:01:08,762
- No.
- No? I can't go there.

1364
02:01:09,404 --> 02:01:12,723
- Hi, Ruthie. How are you?
- Hi, champ.

1365
02:01:15,284 --> 02:01:17,163
What's going on?
I'm great. How you feeling?

1366
02:01:17,244 --> 02:01:19,483
When I go to sleep,
this closes up.

1367
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:23,804
That's what happens. When I go
to sleep, all this rests together.

1368
02:01:23,884 --> 02:01:26,083
During the day, I got to think.

1369
02:01:26,165 --> 02:01:29,404
Get me out of this county.
All the women so pretty.

1370
02:01:29,484 --> 02:01:34,524
All of 'em, they got hair come all
the way down to the back of their knees.

1371
02:01:34,605 --> 02:01:38,044
All of 'em-- All of 'em
about Veronica's complexion.

1372
02:01:38,125 --> 02:01:40,404
Every single one of 'em.
Bad, man.

1373
02:01:42,005 --> 02:01:44,164
But ain't nothing like the sisters.

1374
02:01:45,285 --> 02:01:47,964
Ain't nothing like the sisters.

1375
02:01:51,646 --> 02:01:54,805
Come on. Why don't we go
take a ride or something?

1376
02:01:54,846 --> 02:01:56,365
Wanna come with me?

1377
02:02:05,807 --> 02:02:09,206
Ruth, tell us the truth.
Is this your kind of guy?

1378
02:02:09,887 --> 02:02:11,486
More cushion for the pushin'.

1379
02:02:14,647 --> 02:02:15,806
What'd he say?

1380
02:02:17,087 --> 02:02:19,007
So why you so glad
we still here?

1381
02:02:22,608 --> 02:02:25,888
Making the fight stay here

1382
02:02:27,488 --> 02:02:31,007
Anybody can fight in Vegas.

1383
02:02:36,649 --> 02:02:39,008
Well, that's one job.
I got two.

1384
02:02:39,048 --> 02:02:40,927
Got to whup George.

1385
02:02:48,769 --> 02:02:50,808
Islamic faith help you do that?

1386
02:02:52,049 --> 02:02:55,648
Listen, girl, as a Muslim
I am failed in the eyes of God.

1387
02:02:55,690 --> 02:02:59,809
I should've discovered Islam at 50,
'cause I'm weak on women.

1388
02:03:01,010 --> 02:03:03,089
First they take my eyes.

1389
02:03:03,170 --> 02:03:05,529
My heart follow.

1390
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:07,649
Making me the lovingest husband
in the world...

1391
02:03:07,730 --> 02:03:10,529
and the most terriblest husband
at the same time.

1392
02:03:13,050 --> 02:03:14,690
Look at you.

1393
02:03:14,731 --> 02:03:17,010
Green eyes.

1394
02:03:17,091 --> 02:03:18,810
Cocoa skin.

1395
02:03:19,851 --> 02:03:22,050
Okay, rest of me, let's go.

1396
02:04:12,734 --> 02:04:14,973
- Mrs. Ali.
- Hello, Muhammad, Mr. Cosell.

1397
02:04:15,014 --> 02:04:17,733
- Hey, when you get in?
- Today.

1398
02:04:17,814 --> 02:04:21,094
And I learned we now have this suite
at the intercontinental Hotel.

1399
02:04:22,535 --> 02:04:24,814
Muhammad, may I have
a word with you, please?

1400
02:04:24,895 --> 02:04:26,254
Yeah.

1401
02:04:34,815 --> 02:04:36,014
What's goin' on?

1402
02:04:36,095 --> 02:04:38,415
What do you mean,
what's goin' on?

1403
02:04:38,495 --> 02:04:40,854
Do you have to throw it
in my face?

1404
02:04:40,936 --> 02:04:44,375
Do I have to read about it? Do people
have to call me on the phone to tell me?

1405
02:04:44,456 --> 02:04:46,295
I didn't mean for that
to come out.

1406
02:04:46,376 --> 02:04:49,975
And I live with the casual ones.
I live with 'em.

1407
02:04:50,056 --> 02:04:52,775
So why do you
disrespect me like this?

1408
02:04:52,856 --> 02:04:56,335
I respect you.
I will always respect you.

1409
02:05:05,737 --> 02:05:07,296
Do you love her?

1410
02:05:12,618 --> 02:05:14,017
I don't know.

1411
02:05:20,498 --> 02:05:22,977
So what is supposed to happen now?

1412
02:05:24,738 --> 02:05:26,577
I fight George.

1413
02:05:28,098 --> 02:05:30,657
I didn't come all this far to lose.

1414
02:05:33,218 --> 02:05:34,577
Neither did I.

1415
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:01,139
Belinda.

1416
02:09:33,272 --> 02:09:34,471
There it is.

1417
02:09:47,873 --> 02:09:50,152
Hey, Zack, where's George?

1418
02:09:50,233 --> 02:09:51,632
What's he pulling?

1419
02:09:51,673 --> 02:09:53,472
Where's George?
Where'd he go?

1420
02:09:54,514 --> 02:09:57,633
I just wanna make sure
you're gonna control the evening.

1421
02:09:58,354 --> 02:10:01,153
George is jerking us off,
making us wait.

1422
02:11:35,520 --> 02:11:39,080
It's all over for you, man.
You don't have a chance.

1423
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:42,080
You don't have no chance.

1424
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:44,120
The rumble in the jungle!

1425
02:11:44,200 --> 02:11:46,200
You don't have no chance, man.

1426
02:11:46,280 --> 02:11:47,320
Okay, let's go.

1427
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:50,600
You guys know the rules.
I want a good, clean fight.

1428
02:11:50,680 --> 02:11:53,120
Ali, be quiet
and listen to the instructions.

1429
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:55,120
You been hearing about me
ever since you was a boy.

1430
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:57,520
Ali, be quiet.
Listen to the instructions.

1431
02:11:57,600 --> 02:11:59,760
- Now you got to face me.
- No hitting low.

1432
02:11:59,840 --> 02:12:02,160
- When I tell you to break--
- You got to face me now.

1433
02:12:02,240 --> 02:12:04,120
Be quiet,
or I'll disqualify you.

1434
02:12:04,201 --> 02:12:07,040
When I tell you to break,
I want a clean break. Understand?

1435
02:12:07,081 --> 02:12:10,520
- You shoulda never came to Africa.
- All right, shake hands.

1436
02:12:10,601 --> 02:12:12,480
Take your corners.

1437
02:12:12,521 --> 02:12:14,520
Okay. All right.
No problem.

1438
02:12:56,524 --> 02:12:57,923
Break!

1439
02:13:07,204 --> 02:13:09,243
All right, break. Step back.

1440
02:13:39,526 --> 02:13:42,325
Take it to him!
That's what we came to do, Daddy!

1441
02:13:53,727 --> 02:13:55,606
The heavyweight championship fight...

1442
02:13:55,687 --> 02:13:58,206
- That's all you got?
- live via satellite...

1443
02:13:58,247 --> 02:14:00,126
direct from Zaire, Africa.

1444
02:14:02,528 --> 02:14:05,327
- There we go.
- That's it, Daddy.

1445
02:14:05,408 --> 02:14:08,008
You just keep dancing
around him, okay?

1446
02:14:08,808 --> 02:14:10,367
Just keep moving.

1447
02:14:17,768 --> 02:14:19,527
Legs hurting.

1448
02:14:20,568 --> 02:14:21,967
Air heavy...

1449
02:14:22,048 --> 02:14:23,968
like I'm in water.

1450
02:14:44,050 --> 02:14:45,970
Get away from the rope!

1451
02:14:47,490 --> 02:14:50,370
Get off the rope!
Get off there! Move it!

1452
02:14:52,650 --> 02:14:55,250
Get off there! Get off there!

1453
02:15:03,411 --> 02:15:05,250
Get off the rope!

1454
02:15:09,171 --> 02:15:10,370
Get off them ropes!

1455
02:15:11,211 --> 02:15:15,010
Come on now, Ali,
get off the ropes!

1456
02:15:15,052 --> 02:15:16,451
Come on, baby!

1457
02:15:17,492 --> 02:15:19,251
Come on, Ali!

1458
02:15:21,012 --> 02:15:23,851
That's it?
That's all you got? That's it?

1459
02:15:29,333 --> 02:15:31,653
Move him out to the center!

1460
02:15:31,692 --> 02:15:33,251
There he goes!

1461
02:15:35,173 --> 02:15:38,372
Get away from the ropes!
Get off the ropes!

1462
02:16:10,654 --> 02:16:13,133
Been here before.

1463
02:16:13,215 --> 02:16:15,135
Little greenroom.

1464
02:16:15,215 --> 02:16:17,654
Open that door.
Gonna get out this place.

1465
02:16:17,735 --> 02:16:20,214
Come on, man,
get up and get out.

1466
02:16:34,856 --> 02:16:37,575
They said you could punch, George.

1467
02:16:37,616 --> 02:16:40,216
You ain't hittin'.
You hittin' like a sissy, George.

1468
02:16:41,777 --> 02:16:43,936
You can't lay up on the ropes
like that.

1469
02:16:44,937 --> 02:16:49,136
You're letting him beat on you.
You can't do that, champ. Come on, now.

1470
02:16:49,177 --> 02:16:52,776
-You wanna explain that to me?
-Jab, then go to the middle of the ring.

1471
02:16:52,817 --> 02:16:56,056
- You had your fight going, then--
- You gotta dance, baby.

1472
02:16:56,137 --> 02:16:59,376
Shut up! Just be quiet!
You let me take care of this!

1473
02:16:59,417 --> 02:17:02,536
Got to dance.
You can't come out there like that.

1474
02:17:02,578 --> 02:17:04,457
- You can't back up.
- You got to respect the man.

1475
02:17:04,498 --> 02:17:08,257
What is with the ropes? Something
going on you wanna talk to me about?

1476
02:17:08,338 --> 02:17:11,177
Tell me what's going on with you.
What are you doing?

1477
02:17:11,258 --> 02:17:14,897
Put the jab on him.
You got to let him go and dance.

1478
02:17:14,939 --> 02:17:18,338
Don't let him get in your corner.
He's tying to cut the ring off you.

1479
02:17:18,418 --> 02:17:22,098
He's tying to cut you off the ring.
You can't let that happen.

1480
02:17:23,218 --> 02:17:25,377
Just take care of it!

1481
02:17:27,979 --> 02:17:31,058
And there's the bell.
The fighters meet in mid-ring.

1482
02:17:40,660 --> 02:17:42,099
Get off the ropes!

1483
02:17:42,139 --> 02:17:43,938
Stay off the ropes!

1484
02:17:45,580 --> 02:17:48,779
Foreman again
pushing him against the ropes.

1485
02:17:48,820 --> 02:17:53,099
And Ali laying back, fighting those
blows against the sides of his body.

1486
02:17:53,140 --> 02:17:55,659
Get back in the middle
of the ring, Ali!

1487
02:17:56,661 --> 02:17:58,860
Muhammad, get off the ropes!

1488
02:18:29,622 --> 02:18:33,101
You're punching like a sissy, George.
Punching like a sissy.

1489
02:18:44,784 --> 02:18:46,863
What the hell's going on?
Come on.

1490
02:18:58,424 --> 02:19:01,903
George, get him back.
What the hell's going on? Come on.

1491
02:19:13,505 --> 02:19:16,144
You got to get off the ropes!

1492
02:19:16,185 --> 02:19:17,704
Get off the ropes!

1493
02:19:17,785 --> 02:19:20,584
Eight rounds to go.
Running out of gas, big fella?

1494
02:19:21,706 --> 02:19:23,065
Let him go.

1495
02:19:35,506 --> 02:19:39,265
Can't let you get that second wind which
you don't even know is there for you.

1496
02:19:39,346 --> 02:19:42,385
You want the title?
Want to wear the heavyweight crown?

1497
02:19:42,427 --> 02:19:45,466
Nose broke, jaw smashed,
face busted in.

1498
02:19:45,547 --> 02:19:47,386
You ready for that?
Is that you?

1499
02:19:47,467 --> 02:19:50,747
'Cause you facing a man who will die
before he lets you win.

1500
02:20:02,588 --> 02:20:05,387
Ali, don't let him beat on you
on the inside.

1501
02:20:06,468 --> 02:20:08,347
Don't let him beat on you
on the inside.

1502
02:20:16,669 --> 02:20:17,948
Come on, Ali.

1503
02:20:19,869 --> 02:20:21,988
Let's go, Ali.

1504
02:20:22,069 --> 02:20:25,148
Let's go, baby!
Stay off the ropes!

1505
02:20:25,189 --> 02:20:26,468
Get off the ropes!

1506
02:20:26,549 --> 02:20:28,748
There it is.
Keep 'em in his face.

1507
02:20:30,310 --> 02:20:31,270
Break!

1508
02:20:31,350 --> 02:20:33,389
Oh, you missed him, George!

1509
02:20:33,469 --> 02:20:35,508
You gotta go to work on him, Ali!

1510
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:46,549
I thought you could punch, George.
They said you could punch.

1511
02:20:46,591 --> 02:20:47,990
Come on, Ali!

1512
02:20:49,150 --> 02:20:51,789
Get away from the rope!
Get off the rope!

1513
02:20:51,870 --> 02:20:53,229
He got him!

1514
02:20:59,471 --> 02:21:01,310
Move him around! Take him!

1515
02:21:02,471 --> 02:21:03,870
Come on, Ali!

1516
02:21:10,632 --> 02:21:13,711
Get off the ropes!
Get off the ropes!

1517
02:21:14,832 --> 02:21:16,151
Get off the ropes!

1518
02:21:59,394 --> 02:22:02,233
George Foreman is hit
by a combination of punches...

1519
02:22:02,275 --> 02:22:03,714
and down he goes!

1520
02:22:03,754 --> 02:22:05,433
George Foreman is down!

1521
02:22:08,515 --> 02:22:11,714
He is felled by a combination of blows
from Muhammad Ali!

1522
02:22:29,116 --> 02:22:32,195
Okay, this fight's over!
This fight's over!

1523
02:22:44,077 --> 02:22:46,556
I told you! I told you!

1524
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:59,477
Referee Zack Clayton is counting.
Seven, eight!

1525
02:22:59,557 --> 02:23:01,436
And he's on his knee.
It is over!

1526
02:23:01,520 --> 02:23:03,477
It is over! It is over!

1527
02:23:03,560 --> 02:23:04,957
It is over!

1528
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:08,877
George Foreman has been knocked out
by Muhammad Ali!

1529
02:23:08,960 --> 02:23:11,360
Muhammad Ali
has done the impossible!

1530
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:13,720
He has regained
the heavyweight crown...

1531
02:23:13,800 --> 02:23:18,080
that was taken unjustly
from him in 1967.

1532
02:23:20,840 --> 02:23:23,360
What a moment of history
in this arena...

1533
02:23:23,440 --> 02:23:25,800
in Zaire, Africa!

1534
02:23:35,360 --> 02:23:37,760
A tremendous, tremendous moment.

1535
02:25:08,007 --> 02:25:18,965
THE END
