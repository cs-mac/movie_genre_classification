1
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,215
Keep an eye out...
-Okay.

2
00:01:05,505 --> 00:01:07,302
Shmaya, where are you?

3
00:01:08,705 --> 00:01:11,014
Is it over?
Can I go home?

4
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,100
Home?

5
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:17,025
You know what you have
to do first...

6
00:01:29,345 --> 00:01:32,576
They’re moving him again.

7
00:01:34,025 --> 00:01:35,538
I don’t know.

8
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:38,814
Maybe we shouId act...

9
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,901
or keep watching...

10
00:02:00,105 --> 00:02:01,936
Watch your head...

11
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:04,414
Hurry...

12
00:02:35,145 --> 00:02:36,180
Arnav!

13
00:02:37,905 --> 00:02:39,497
What’s the damage?

14
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,377
You had two araks
and three cognacs?

15
00:02:41,705 --> 00:02:42,854
The araks are on me

16
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:46,417
75 shekeIs.
-75?!

17
00:02:46,905 --> 00:02:48,702
AIcohoI prices went up, Arnav.

18
00:02:49,465 --> 00:02:52,821
We shouId start an action committee.

19
00:02:52,945 --> 00:02:57,939
CRAP - The Committee for
Reduction of AIcohoI Prices.

20
00:02:58,465 --> 00:03:00,933
I’m ten shekeIs short...

21
00:03:01,185 --> 00:03:03,141
You’re kiIIing me CaviIio...

22
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:07,144
I spend aII my tips on you.

23
00:03:07,265 --> 00:03:09,335
I end up Ieaving you a tip.

24
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:11,695
You’re a saint, Arnav. A saint.

25
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,623
BIess your souI.
-Good night. -Good night.

26
00:03:17,785 --> 00:03:20,345
Check, pIease...

27
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:21,739
Coming

28
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:29,143
Makes me mad that peopIe here
feeI free to grab you.

29
00:03:29,265 --> 00:03:31,540
This is a bar,
not a convent.

30
00:03:31,665 --> 00:03:33,576
TabIe 4 wants
a Iast round of beer.

31
00:03:33,705 --> 00:03:36,742
WiII do,
your hottie hoIiness.

32
00:03:36,865 --> 00:03:38,776
Stop staring at me.

33
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:41,457
I’m serious about turning reIigious.

34
00:03:41,585 --> 00:03:44,019
You were serious as
a punk rocker...

35
00:03:44,145 --> 00:03:45,863
When you studied
Chinese medicine...

36
00:03:46,065 --> 00:03:47,896
You’re so annoying.

37
00:03:48,025 --> 00:03:49,140
I’m gonna start cIeaning up.

38
00:03:50,585 --> 00:03:55,613
Wanna come over for coffee?
-’’Wanna come over for coffee’’?

39
00:03:55,825 --> 00:03:59,420
If you want to Iead me astray,
you’II have to do better than that.

40
00:03:59,905 --> 00:04:02,055
You think I’m that easy?

41
00:04:02,185 --> 00:04:05,416
Makes me mad when you try
to distance me from sainthood.

42
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:07,058
On the contrary.
When you come over,

43
00:04:07,185 --> 00:04:09,460
sainthood is in the hood.

44
00:04:09,585 --> 00:04:11,894
And Peter Piper picked
pickIed peppers. -Not funny.

45
00:04:12,025 --> 00:04:13,822
And Suzy seIIs seashore seasheIIs.

46
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:15,981
Stop it.
It won’t get you anywhere.

47
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:19,616
Check out that car.

48
00:04:19,745 --> 00:04:21,861
You’II never have a car Iike that.

49
00:04:22,025 --> 00:04:23,697
Why?
I’II puII doubIe shifts at the bar...

50
00:04:23,825 --> 00:04:27,659
Forget it, you’re a penniIess
graffiti artist with no prospects.

51
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,104
What’s the probIem?

52
00:04:29,225 --> 00:04:31,864
What’s the probIem?
There’s no peace in the MiddIe East.

53
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:35,062
I’m overdrawn at the bank.
I have pigeons in my window...

54
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,698
Buzz off.

55
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:39,658
What? -Вon’t get me started.
Just buzz off.

56
00:04:48,345 --> 00:04:50,381
The kitchen is the other way.

57
00:04:50,505 --> 00:04:51,938
Weird...

58
00:04:52,065 --> 00:04:53,862
A fancy car Iike that
in our neighborhood?

59
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:56,493
Great, that means I’m the one
making coffee.

60
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,900
I can’t beIieve
I used to Iive with you.

61
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,820
So strange...

62
00:05:20,025 --> 00:05:21,856
Mr. Buzz Off and his friends

63
00:05:21,985 --> 00:05:23,896
just went into the abandoned apartment.

64
00:05:28,305 --> 00:05:29,215
Vax?

65
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:31,780
What?

66
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:35,103
What’s that bIue Iight?

67
00:05:35,905 --> 00:05:38,100
What are they,
Hassidic aIiens?

68
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:41,303
What bIue Iight?
-Up there.

69
00:05:41,425 --> 00:05:43,461
CouId be
their ceII phone Iights...

70
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:46,145
They’re probabIy
just deaIers or junkies.

71
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:48,694
Say goodnight to the aIiens...

72
00:05:48,825 --> 00:05:51,100
I don’t know what’s with me IateIy.

73
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,817
I see things...

74
00:05:54,545 --> 00:05:57,742
I’m such a pathetic Ioser...

75
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,975
Sex with your ex is the Iowest...

76
00:06:00,105 --> 00:06:01,663
Sorry, I didn’t mean to...

77
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:03,980
If I don’t repent,
I’II never find true Iove.

78
00:06:04,105 --> 00:06:05,424
I’m putting on some music.

79
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,379
Good morning.
-Good morning.

80
00:07:18,945 --> 00:07:20,776
Top of the morning, Mr. Weinberg.

81
00:07:20,905 --> 00:07:22,304
Top of the morning.

82
00:07:24,705 --> 00:07:27,139
JoIt me with java

83
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:31,457
and egg on an egg sandwich.

84
00:07:57,065 --> 00:07:58,054
How’s it going?

85
00:07:58,905 --> 00:08:00,702
Good morning, Mr. Aharonov.

86
00:08:01,225 --> 00:08:04,023
Good morning.
-I hate to cut you off, but...

87
00:08:04,145 --> 00:08:05,976
Cut... Get it?
-Very funny.

88
00:08:06,105 --> 00:08:08,061
Is ChoIera...
Is Chaim out back?

89
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:09,379
He’s out back.

90
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:14,257
Como estas, ChoIera?

91
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:18,094
Praise the Lord.
Brown or green?

92
00:08:18,305 --> 00:08:19,863
What’s the dish of the day?

93
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:23,500
We have green from Sinai, cheap,

94
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,577
but for our speciaI cIients
we have hydro from Amsterdam.

95
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:29,856
One puff and you’II be speaking Вutch.
-Of course I wanna speak Вutch...

96
00:08:43,985 --> 00:08:47,216
Greetings and saIutations...
-HeIIo, how are you?

97
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,495
BakIava, pIease.

98
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:51,943
Here you go.

99
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:54,940
How much is that?
-Sixty.

100
00:08:55,585 --> 00:08:58,019
Two vodkas, neat.
-With pIeasure, your hoIiness.

101
00:08:58,145 --> 00:08:59,373
Arnav, don’t forget me.

102
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:01,018
Arak? Cognac? Whisky?

103
00:09:01,145 --> 00:09:02,260
You decide which order.

104
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,658
What wiII you have?

105
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:18,818
Shandy, pIease?

106
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:22,096
Shandy?

107
00:09:22,585 --> 00:09:24,701
My bIood sugar’s Iow.

108
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,738
Вo you have anything eIse sweet?
BakIava or something?

109
00:09:28,905 --> 00:09:32,614
BakIava?
You came to the right pIace.

110
00:09:32,985 --> 00:09:35,453
Not just any bakIava, it’s EiffeI!

111
00:09:35,585 --> 00:09:39,294
Whoa, you mean
EiffeI SuItan SuIeiman?

112
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:41,934
In its fuII EiffIeness...

113
00:09:42,105 --> 00:09:44,096
Respect to the bakIava meister.
-Respect.

114
00:09:46,305 --> 00:09:48,580
You drive aII the way
to SuItan SuIeiman for bakIava?

115
00:09:48,705 --> 00:09:50,900
Вrive? I Iive here in Musrara,
across the street,

116
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:53,983
you know where the art schooI is?
-You go to schooI there?

117
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:57,063
I did -
painting and muItimedia.

118
00:09:57,225 --> 00:10:00,661
But aII that sitting in cIass,
discipIine, raising your hand,

119
00:10:00,785 --> 00:10:01,774
not for me.

120
00:10:01,945 --> 00:10:04,505
Arnav!
There’s a hoIe in my gIass.

121
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:07,104
What did he caII you?

122
00:10:07,705 --> 00:10:09,058
Arnav. Nice to meet you.

123
00:10:09,185 --> 00:10:10,903
Your name is Arnav (rabbit)?

124
00:10:11,065 --> 00:10:13,784
Long story.
My birth certificate says ArieI Navon,

125
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:18,416
in 1st grade I was Arnavon,
Arnaviko, Arnaviyahu...

126
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,422
Arnav!
-Yeah, what now?

127
00:10:20,585 --> 00:10:24,942
What now? I had my arak,
and what comes after arak?

128
00:10:25,065 --> 00:10:27,101
Cognac!
-Cognac

129
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,299
Arnav, wait a second!

130
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,944
It’s you?

131
00:11:10,705 --> 00:11:12,104
What’s wrong with you?

132
00:11:12,945 --> 00:11:14,219
You scared me.

133
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,694
Isn’t it against the Iaw
to deface waIIs?

134
00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:19,101
Paragraph 9 of the PenaI Code:

135
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:22,104
’’He who writes, paints,
or draws iIIegaIIy

136
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,903
’’on another’s property

137
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,619
’’is IiabIe to one year’s imprisonment.’’
Is it worth it?

138
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,178
You a cop or something?

139
00:11:28,545 --> 00:11:30,422
LuckiIy for you, not anymore.

140
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:32,342
So what do you want from me?

141
00:11:32,465 --> 00:11:34,057
I have a proposition for you.

142
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:36,023
I couIdn’t say it
with peopIe around.

143
00:11:36,145 --> 00:11:40,821
Man, bakIava is no probIem,
but there are things I’m not into.

144
00:11:40,945 --> 00:11:43,095
I need your apartment
for a week’s surveiIIance.

145
00:11:43,225 --> 00:11:46,217
So it wasn’t just my imagination.

146
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:48,381
Are they stiII
in the abandoned apartment?

147
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,257
Вoes it matter?

148
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,341
I don’t want any troubIe.

149
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,217
Someone’s Iocked in there,
and needs heIp.

150
00:11:54,345 --> 00:11:57,815
So, caII your oId job
and have them send a cruiser?

151
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,663
It’s not that simpIe.

152
00:12:00,785 --> 00:12:03,857
What do you say?
1 0,000 shekeIs, cash in hand.

153
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:05,498
Can I be straight with you?

154
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:09,144
You don’t Iook Iike someone
who wants to heIp.

155
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,414
1 5,000 shekeIs. See?

156
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,775
I just heIped you
to an extra 5,000 shekeIs.

157
00:12:14,905 --> 00:12:16,099
Think about it.

158
00:12:16,385 --> 00:12:17,784
Give me a caII.

159
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:18,335
Good morning.
-Good morning.

160
00:14:58,585 --> 00:15:00,257
What’s happening?

161
00:15:01,065 --> 00:15:04,375
I saw you and your ’’buddies’’
come in here Iast night,

162
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,661
I thought I’d check on you

163
00:15:07,305 --> 00:15:08,579
Is everything okay?

164
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:16,460
I feIt Iike having
a Ioquat, so I picked some,

165
00:15:16,585 --> 00:15:18,416
and I figured since I’m...

166
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,138
Want a Ioquat?

167
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:24,778
Take it.

168
00:15:33,545 --> 00:15:37,936
’’BIessed are You, Lord our God,
Creator of the fruit of the tree.’’

169
00:15:38,345 --> 00:15:39,334
Amen.

170
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,777
Want some more?

171
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:04,778
No, keep it...
-I can’t.

172
00:16:04,905 --> 00:16:06,463
Keep it for Iater.

173
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:08,816
No, I’m not aIIowed. Take it.

174
00:16:08,945 --> 00:16:11,584
Why not?
It’s a fruit. It’s kosher...

175
00:16:15,785 --> 00:16:17,776
PIease take the pits with you.

176
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:19,816
It isn’t stoIen,
the tree beIongs to everyone.

177
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,861
I know it’s none
of my business, but...

178
00:16:24,785 --> 00:16:26,616
You wanna caII somebody?

179
00:16:28,065 --> 00:16:30,101
Want me to caII somebody for you?

180
00:16:30,225 --> 00:16:31,738
No, thanks.

181
00:16:31,905 --> 00:16:33,133
You sure?

182
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:34,939
FamiIy?

183
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:36,460
The poIice?

184
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,940
What the heII are you doing?

185
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:05,422
What’s in your head,
brains or bakIava?

186
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,899
I didn’t do anything!

187
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:08,981
You think this is some
drunken brawI at the bar?

188
00:17:09,105 --> 00:17:10,504
Вo you know
what you’re getting into?

189
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:13,822
This is a bad, bad story.

190
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,663
I’m not getting into anything.

191
00:17:15,865 --> 00:17:18,015
I asked you to heIp,
not get in the way.

192
00:17:18,145 --> 00:17:21,455
I’m sorry.
Now pIease Iet me go.

193
00:17:22,105 --> 00:17:25,222
I need your apartment,
I asked you niceIy.

194
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,256
I offered to pay you.

195
00:17:27,585 --> 00:17:29,303
You offered and I refused.

196
00:17:29,545 --> 00:17:31,661
I don’t owe you anything.

197
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:35,622
Wait.
You’re right, I’m sorry.

198
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:39,537
I need your heIp.

199
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:42,862
Okay, but teII me what’s going on.

200
00:17:42,985 --> 00:17:44,384
I can’t.

201
00:17:44,825 --> 00:17:47,214
I’m a private investigator,
I have a cIient,

202
00:17:47,345 --> 00:17:50,496
I must keep this confidentiaI.

203
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:54,819
If the cIient’s the probIem,
bring him here and expIain.

204
00:17:55,065 --> 00:17:57,863
Listen here, bunny-boy,
you mess with me

205
00:17:57,985 --> 00:18:00,340
and I’II caII the cops
and teII them who’s defacing the waIIs

206
00:18:00,545 --> 00:18:03,013
with his chiIdish doodIes,
understand?

207
00:18:03,265 --> 00:18:04,903
ChiIdish doodIes?

208
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:07,224
Thanks a Iot.

209
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:10,738
Wait, I didn’t mean to...

210
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:18,456
PeopIe in this city are
aIways Iooking for troubIe.

211
00:18:18,585 --> 00:18:21,258
We shouId start an action committee.

212
00:18:21,425 --> 00:18:26,340
The CUNT - ’’Committee against
UItra NationaIistic Tendencies.’’

213
00:18:28,505 --> 00:18:31,702
I’m accepting donations,
I’II take money or arak...

214
00:18:32,665 --> 00:18:34,018
Who’s the hunk?

215
00:18:34,265 --> 00:18:35,175
Nobody...
-’’Nobody’’?

216
00:18:35,305 --> 00:18:37,296
You met a Mad Hatter...

217
00:19:35,905 --> 00:19:40,820
Mr. Shmaya Knafo
is stiII pIaying for time.

218
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,417
Can’t you see we’re out of patience?

219
00:19:47,905 --> 00:19:53,582
With aII due respect
for fasting and penance.

220
00:19:53,705 --> 00:19:56,173
You yourseIf taught us
that true contrition

221
00:19:56,305 --> 00:20:00,423
must come through
written confession.

222
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:04,140
so your mortaI memory
won’t betray you in the future,

223
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:06,733
you must write
your own confession.

224
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:11,575
I hate myseIf so much I even
contempIated suicide, I swear.

225
00:20:26,705 --> 00:20:30,254
I’m sure I heard something.

232
00:21:18,585 --> 00:21:22,260
He is a prophet.

He has devoted himseIf

He is the chosen one...

237
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,298
Everybody has to donate money.

238
00:21:44,505 --> 00:21:47,019
Ordinary foIks and big businesses.

239
00:21:48,345 --> 00:21:50,301

240
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,904
sociaI justice!

241
00:21:53,825 --> 00:21:56,385
But it’s not onIy our request...

242
00:21:56,505 --> 00:22:01,021
It’s God’s request!
You must donate...

243
00:22:19,745 --> 00:22:21,701
Where’s the cIient?

244
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:24,578
The cIient is inside.
Вo you have a ceII phone?

245
00:22:26,905 --> 00:22:28,543
What are you doing?

246
00:22:29,865 --> 00:22:31,742
You’II get the battery back
after the meeting.

247
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:35,414
You suspect everybody -
your kids must Iove you.

248
00:22:45,065 --> 00:22:46,737
What is this pIace?

249
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:52,744
Is this where we’re meeting him?
-Her.

250
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:59,259
Arnav, this is EIIa Gorsky.
Shmaya Knafo’s sister-in-Iaw.

251
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:01,656
Mr. Knafo and my sister
have been together

252
00:23:01,785 --> 00:23:03,457
since they met
in a kibbutz.

253
00:23:03,985 --> 00:23:05,941
After about 6 months

254
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:08,454
aII the kibbutzniks
started fighting over him.

255
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:12,944
He had a strange abiIity
to predict the future...

256
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:14,823
What do you mean ’’predict’’?

257
00:23:14,945 --> 00:23:16,458
Like a weatherman?

258
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:19,224
Yes, but not just the weather.

259
00:23:19,825 --> 00:23:22,385
In the cowshed, he knew
which cows were going to get sick.

260
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:24,143
AIso, which tractors
were going to break down...

261
00:23:24,265 --> 00:23:27,063
Let’s get to the point,
if you don’t mind.

262
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,301
PeopIe started begging him

263
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:34,582
to read their future.

264
00:23:34,985 --> 00:23:39,825
Then three wise guys
reaIized Knafo’s ’’startup’’ potentiaI

265
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:43,056
They branded him ’’rabbi’’
though he has no ’’rabbinicaI’’ credentiaIs...

266
00:23:43,185 --> 00:23:45,779
They started a media hype campaign -

267
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:48,419
Knafo can make the bIind see,
the crippIes waIk...

268
00:23:48,505 --> 00:23:51,542
He became known for his powers...
-His ’’powers’’?

269
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,697
The donations
got Iarger every year

270
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:56,861
The wise guys
paid themseIves fat saIaries...

271
00:23:56,985 --> 00:23:59,215
before you know it

272
00:23:59,385 --> 00:24:03,094
the ’’startup’’ had 60 miIIion
donation shekeIs in the bank...

273
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:06,023
60 miIIion shekeIs
and he’s Iocked up in a dump?

274
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:08,818
Why not a fancy hoteI?

275
00:24:08,945 --> 00:24:11,061
That’s exactIy what
we’re trying to find out.

276
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:15,255
Something went wrong...
between the wise guys and Mr. Knafo.

277
00:24:16,865 --> 00:24:18,981
A few months ago
my brother-in-Iaw disappeared.

278
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:21,539
My sister was toId he
feIt his powers fading

279
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:23,496
and he needed to get away

280
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:25,980
and purify himseIf in JerusaIem.

281
00:24:26,105 --> 00:24:28,460
because if we have a probIem
with ’’powers’’

282
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,860
we’II soIve it in the city of powers...

283
00:24:30,985 --> 00:24:34,819
A month passed, then another,
and we didn’t hear from him.

284
00:24:34,945 --> 00:24:39,461
With aII due respect
for ’’powers’’ - he couId caII, right?

285
00:24:39,585 --> 00:24:42,782
My sister got very worried

286
00:24:42,945 --> 00:24:46,415
and asked me to hire someone
to find out what’s going on, quietIy.

287
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:48,975
What do they want from him?
-We don’t know.

288
00:24:49,145 --> 00:24:51,864
PeopIe wiII go far
when 60 miIIion shekeIs are at risk...

289
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:54,096
Mr. Knafo’s Iife may be in danger.

290
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:57,584
But if they’re making
so much money off him,

291
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,337
why wouId they kiII him?

292
00:24:59,745 --> 00:25:03,181
Sometimes a hoIy man’s gravesite
is worth more than the man aIive...

293
00:25:03,865 --> 00:25:07,414
That’s why we need your heIp.
UrgentIy.

294
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:14,817
I need to think it over...
I’m going to the bathroom...

295
00:25:24,065 --> 00:25:26,499
I suggest you try to convince him

296
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:28,616
Let him show you around

297
00:25:28,745 --> 00:25:30,463
Spend time together.

298
00:25:30,665 --> 00:25:32,860
You’II get more
out of him than I wiII.

299
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:36,701
JerusaIem makes me nervous...

300
00:25:36,905 --> 00:25:39,658
Is it 1 00% safe here?
-97%.

301
00:25:39,785 --> 00:25:41,980
I try to be nice
so others wiII be nice to me.

302
00:25:42,105 --> 00:25:44,175
Suicide bombers know that?

303
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,820
Sorry, I got scared...

304
00:25:51,945 --> 00:25:53,503
97%.

305
00:25:54,145 --> 00:25:55,817
Here, this is the pIace.

306
00:26:00,465 --> 00:26:01,500
WeII?

307
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:05,578
I know you JerusaIemites
cIaim your hummus is the best

308
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:08,896
regrettabIy, I must admit
you have a case.

309
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:11,903
Thanks. I know Iots of
good pIaces Iike this.

310
00:26:21,865 --> 00:26:27,019
So, your sister reaIIy beIieves
Knafo has ’’powers’’?

311
00:26:27,225 --> 00:26:29,580
It’s a nightmare...

312
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:33,260
she is married
to someone who represents

313
00:26:33,385 --> 00:26:35,979
the dark forces that
threaten progress in this country.

314
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,455
My sister means
the worId to me,

315
00:26:39,865 --> 00:26:42,060
and I’m here to heIp her
save her famiIy.

316
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,255
CarefuI...
-Sorry.

317
00:26:48,225 --> 00:26:51,854
Are you okay? -I’m fine. That’s
the second time you saved me...

318
00:26:52,385 --> 00:26:55,024
I’m just your average superhero.

319
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:58,098
Thank you. For everything.

320
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:14,980
Here’s haIf.

321
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:17,096
You’II get the other haIf
when this is over.

322
00:27:17,225 --> 00:27:19,261
When’s ’’over’’?
-When it’s over.

323
00:27:21,385 --> 00:27:26,584
Take this, it’s a bump key,
it’II open any pin tumbIer Iock.

324
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:30,863
You put it in the Iock,
bump it on the side

325
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:33,260
untiI the teeth Iock,
and you’re in.

326
00:27:33,865 --> 00:27:36,857
Where did you get it?
-The key fairy gave it to me.

327
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:39,979
Anyway, if Knafo asks you
what you want,

328
00:27:40,105 --> 00:27:43,256
teII him you saw them beating him up,
and since you’re a good neighbor

329
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:45,416
and in Musrara
peopIe don’t caII the poIice,

330
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:48,457
you asked the IandIord, who happens
to be a friend, for the key,

331
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:50,541
and you came in to heIp.
Okay?

332
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:52,018
Then he Ieaves with me
and it’s over.

333
00:27:52,145 --> 00:27:53,737
I don’t think
he’II Ieave with you.

334
00:27:56,665 --> 00:27:59,054
Why not? He’s hungry,
he’s aII beaten up,

335
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:00,857
of course he’II come out.
WouIdn’t you?

336
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:05,183
I’m not him. Besides,
our job isn’t to get him out,

337
00:28:05,465 --> 00:28:06,784
our job is to pIant a camera.

338
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:09,658
HoId on, hoId on.
A camera?

339
00:28:09,785 --> 00:28:11,457
You said you wanted to use
the apartment for surveiIIance...

340
00:28:11,585 --> 00:28:14,019
You toId Ms. Gorsky
you’re wiIIing to heIp, didn’t you?

341
00:28:14,145 --> 00:28:18,423
Yeah, but pIanting a camera?
-You aren’t pIanting a forest.

342
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:20,775
It’s just a camera,
what’s the big deaI?

343
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:24,864
You go in, Iook for something smaII,
a picture or something,

344
00:28:24,985 --> 00:28:27,135
that you can see the whoIe room from,

345
00:28:27,265 --> 00:28:29,825
and pIant the camera.
-Are you serious?

346
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:31,936
Вo I Iook Iike a funny guy?
-ShouIdn’t we just teII him

347
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:33,942
we came to rescue him?
That his sister-in-Iaw sent us?

348
00:28:34,065 --> 00:28:36,101
That’s the Iast thing
we shouId teII him.

349
00:28:36,705 --> 00:28:40,061
Use your hare brain.
The guy’s Iocked in an apartment,

350
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,540
they’re beating him up
and he doesn’t ask for heIp. Why?

351
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:44,257
These peopIe found out
something about him.

352
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:46,853
If you teII him
you’re there to rescue him

353
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:48,577
he might panic...

354
00:28:48,745 --> 00:28:51,259
I toId you, this thing couId end up
in a gravesite...

355
00:28:51,745 --> 00:28:54,339
What are you doing?

356
00:28:55,465 --> 00:28:57,501
InhaIing seIf-confidence.

357
00:28:58,105 --> 00:28:59,902
You think whatever’s iIIegaI
is fun, huh?

358
00:29:00,025 --> 00:29:02,141
And you think that whatever’s fun
is iIIegaI, huh?

359
00:29:34,545 --> 00:29:36,217
Rabbi Knafo?

360
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:41,055
It’s Arnav, the fruit picker...

361
00:29:43,385 --> 00:29:44,534
Anybody home?

362
00:29:44,665 --> 00:29:46,257
What are you doing here?

363
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:50,900
Sorry, but Iast night
I got home from work

364
00:29:51,065 --> 00:29:53,101
and heard yeIIs
coming from here

365
00:29:53,265 --> 00:29:55,017
and I wanted to make sure
you’re okay.

366
00:29:57,185 --> 00:30:00,097
Why do you care about me?

367
00:30:00,225 --> 00:30:02,785
If your neighbor is in troubIe
shouIdn’t you heIp him?

368
00:30:02,945 --> 00:30:07,621
So I got a key and...
Let’s get out of here...

369
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:11,899
I can’t...
-Look at you,

370
00:30:12,025 --> 00:30:15,461
you’re aII bIack and bIue,
and it stinks in here.

371
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:16,984
What’s the probIem?

372
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:21,897
How do you know my name?

373
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:26,462
I heard them say your name,
I googIed you,

374
00:30:26,785 --> 00:30:29,538
saw your website,

375
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:34,254
peopIe who say you saved
their Iives with your powers.

376
00:30:34,785 --> 00:30:37,743
PersonaIIy, I don’t know
about supernaturaI powers...

377
00:30:37,865 --> 00:30:39,537
You are not a beIiever?

378
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:44,702
You don’t beIieve in the Creator?
Lord have mercy, you need heIp...

379
00:30:45,625 --> 00:30:48,503
CIearIy, you’re the one
who needs heIp.

380
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:50,817
Is that what you think?

381
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:54,336
Can I ask you a few questions?

382
00:30:54,865 --> 00:30:57,823
Such as?
-What do you do for a Iiving?

383
00:30:57,985 --> 00:31:01,455
I paint a IittIe, write a IittIe...

384
00:31:01,585 --> 00:31:03,416
A IittIe of this
and a IittIe of that

385
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:05,695
is it enough,
or is it too IittIe?

386
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:08,061
Sometimes it’s enough,
and sometimes...

387
00:31:08,185 --> 00:31:10,141
I’m not sure
where it’s going, but...

388
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:12,381
I can teII you...

389
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:14,502
How exactIy
do you do that?

390
00:31:17,905 --> 00:31:19,418
I use my imagination...

391
00:31:20,465 --> 00:31:24,219
I have a pipeIine to God.
He Iets me see the future.

392
00:31:24,705 --> 00:31:28,618
Ask a question.
Work, reIationships, you name it.

393
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,497
I have a job.

394
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:32,338
ReIationship...

395
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:35,895
ReIationship.
-ReIationship.

396
00:31:54,425 --> 00:31:59,863
I see... your Iove interest
is at odds with herseIf.

397
00:32:02,105 --> 00:32:04,903
Be carefuI,
it couId get compIicated.

398
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:08,822
There’s an unsoIved issue
with turning reIigious...

399
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,495
and a dark secret...

400
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:17,262
that has to do with...

401
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,579
me?

402
00:32:25,105 --> 00:32:26,857
I don’t know how...

403
00:32:29,865 --> 00:32:32,584
You know what
I am taIking about?

404
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:40,580
I don’t know how
but he had me aII confused.

405
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:44,015
Confusing peopIe is his business.

406
00:32:44,585 --> 00:32:48,498
If you’d inhaIed
Iess seIf-confidence

407
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:50,536
you wouIdn’t be so confused.

408
00:32:50,665 --> 00:32:53,259
By tomorrow I’II have a repIica
and you can pIant the camera.

409
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:55,660
Me? That’s iIIegaI!

410
00:32:55,785 --> 00:32:58,618
And painting graffiti is IegaI?
Eh, Bugs Bunny?

411
00:32:58,745 --> 00:33:01,418
Listen, I’m sick of pIaying
see-saw with you.

412
00:33:01,545 --> 00:33:04,537
You got your money, didn’t you?
Then do your job.

413
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:10,904
You know what?

414
00:33:11,265 --> 00:33:13,335
Take the money.
I don’t need it.

415
00:33:13,465 --> 00:33:16,901
It’s there, on the tabIe.
I don’t want it. Take it.

416
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:18,694
Вon’t get aII sensitive on me...

417
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:20,941
Leave me aIone.
I don’t want to be invoIved in this.

418
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:23,260
What’s your probIem?
-TeII your cIient I’m sorry

419
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,296
but this isn’t for me.
-Arnav!

420
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:26,974
Arnav!

421
00:33:49,185 --> 00:33:51,699
Hey.
-Thanks for coming, I...

422
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:54,140
I wasn’t sure
you’d be wiIIing to see me.

423
00:33:55,105 --> 00:33:57,494
Gittis said you have a probIem
and you want to return the money...

424
00:33:57,625 --> 00:33:59,104
Listen, he’s a reaI paranoid...

425
00:33:59,225 --> 00:34:02,661
and nasty and vioIent and strange...

426
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:04,582
It’s scary to have
a guy Iike him around.

427
00:34:04,705 --> 00:34:06,696
You’re right.
-And he carries a gun.

428
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:09,214
I’m reaIIy sorry
you have to go through this.

429
00:34:09,385 --> 00:34:12,934
But the peopIe who recommended him
said he doesn’t have a Iife,

430
00:34:13,065 --> 00:34:15,454
so he’s totaIIy committed
to his work.

431
00:34:16,865 --> 00:34:19,015
There’s nothing to be afraid of,
trust me.

432
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,378
PIease.

433
00:34:26,825 --> 00:34:28,941
I don’t want
to sound hystericaI, but...

434
00:34:30,385 --> 00:34:32,296
it’s a matter of Iife and death.

435
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:35,297
I don’t know
what eIse I can do...

436
00:34:37,745 --> 00:34:39,781
It’s not Iike I don’t understand,
I do.

437
00:34:39,985 --> 00:34:42,863
But I have a bad feeIing
about that Gittis guy.

438
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:46,615
On the other hand,

439
00:34:46,745 --> 00:34:50,181
maybe I automaticaIIy hate him
because he used to be a cop.

440
00:34:57,985 --> 00:35:01,421
WeII, if I buckIe under now
Iike a wimp you’II have come here

441
00:35:01,545 --> 00:35:03,297
to taIk for a minute and a haIf.

442
00:35:05,225 --> 00:35:07,136
It probabIy took you Ionger
to find parking.

443
00:35:07,265 --> 00:35:09,574
It took haIf an hour
-HaIf an hour?

444
00:35:09,705 --> 00:35:10,615
Yeah.

445
00:35:13,665 --> 00:35:15,974
As I’m aIready here

446
00:35:16,225 --> 00:35:18,420
and as you did so weII
with the hummus,

447
00:35:18,545 --> 00:35:22,618
you can show me JerusaIem
isn’t as duII as I thought...

448
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:28,425
ActuaIIy, there’s a new
hip-hop cIub...

449
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:31,940
I don’t know
if that’s for you...

450
00:35:32,145 --> 00:35:33,578
Is that an insuIt?

451
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:39,818
Something to drink?

452
00:35:41,665 --> 00:35:43,701
A vodka chaser?
-Sure.

453
00:35:44,505 --> 00:35:46,336
Two vodka chasers...

454
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,813
See? JerusaIem isn’t onIy hummus.
-CooI.

455
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:57,534
To the city and its powers
and its superheroes.

456
00:35:57,665 --> 00:36:00,657
This superhero is aIways
at your service. -Cheers.

457
00:36:01,865 --> 00:36:04,060
CIassy company, Arnav.

458
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:07,780
Can I offer you a bargain?

459
00:36:07,905 --> 00:36:09,736
You’re working nights, ChoIera?

460
00:36:09,905 --> 00:36:11,577
Not reaIIy,
I just came to Iook around.

461
00:36:11,705 --> 00:36:14,139
But I might as weII do some business.

462
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,820
I offered to go in with the owner,
but he got aII snooty on me

463
00:36:17,945 --> 00:36:19,537
and said,
’’This isn’t a barbershop...’’

464
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:22,975
Not nice. -Never mind.
How about a feeIgood?

465
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:27,174
Want some?
-I feeI good aIready, thanks.

466
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:29,176
And I have to drive back
to TeI Aviv,

467
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:30,943
so I don’t think I’II even drink...

468
00:36:33,185 --> 00:36:34,584
What did you caII him? ChoIera?

469
00:36:34,705 --> 00:36:37,777
An acronym for
CHOim LERia Aharonov.

470
00:36:38,265 --> 00:36:40,938
He’s a mega-geek,
but he Iikes to be caIIed ChoIera,

471
00:36:41,105 --> 00:36:42,902
it sounds tougher.

472
00:36:47,665 --> 00:36:51,180
They want me to paint on the waII,
mind if I Ieave you for a minute?

473
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:52,658
What? Um...

474
00:36:53,025 --> 00:36:57,143
Go ahead. Вon’t worry about me,
I’II manage.

475
00:37:25,825 --> 00:37:28,897
Just a minute...

476
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,458
You crazy?
Just woke up...

477
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:34,540
You aIive?

478
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,179
I was worried.

479
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:41,182
CaIIed you Iate Iast night
but you didn’t answer...

480
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,500
I didn’t hear it. I crashed.

481
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:45,741
God heIp us,
put on some cIothes.

482
00:37:45,865 --> 00:37:48,379
HaIf the day is gone...

483
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:51,144
Вon’t you want your Iife
to go anywhere?

484
00:37:51,265 --> 00:37:54,541
You must do something,
you aren’t 1 7 anymore...

485
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:55,854
What a mess.

486
00:37:56,065 --> 00:38:00,138
You know what’s good
about turning reIigious? Order.

487
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:02,256
You wake up knowing
exactIy what to do...

488
00:38:02,385 --> 00:38:05,775
Your saintIiness, isn’t it
a IittIe earIy for bibIe cIass?

489
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:07,620
Come on...

490
00:38:13,385 --> 00:38:15,376
Nice drawing.
-Thanks.

491
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:18,295
What’s with the aIiens
in the abandoned apartment?

492
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:19,940
You won’t beIieve it.

493
00:38:21,625 --> 00:38:24,298
We can’t.
-What do you mean, we can’t?

494
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,815
You know how difficuIt it is
to get a reading from him?

495
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:29,936
Six months wait if you’re Iucky.

496
00:38:30,065 --> 00:38:31,384
He traveIs paths above the cIouds...

497
00:38:31,505 --> 00:38:33,780
So do airIine stewardesses...
FIy on in.

498
00:38:37,305 --> 00:38:39,421
Maybe he can teII me
when I’II find true Iove...

499
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:42,457
PIease.

500
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:48,099
It can change my whoIe Iife. PIease.

501
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,344
What?

502
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:04,255
Sorry the conditions aren’t
ideaI for consuItations...

503
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,262
It’s fine with me.

504
00:39:08,225 --> 00:39:10,102
Go away...
-Fine.

505
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:12,504
You owe me one...

506
00:39:24,545 --> 00:39:25,580
I’m shaking.

507
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:28,784
He toId me things
that sound impossibIe, but...

508
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:30,054
I beIieve him...

509
00:39:30,905 --> 00:39:32,497
What did he say?

510
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:34,422
A week from now
my Iife is going to change.

511
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,774
’’Going to change...’’

512
00:39:35,905 --> 00:39:39,420
Вon’t spoiI it with skepticism.
-I’m not spoiIing it. Let’s go.

513
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,813
Where are we going?
-To Weinberg’s.

514
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:42,856
I haven’t had my morning coffee yet.
Come on.

515
00:39:50,425 --> 00:39:51,699
Where are you?

516
00:39:55,425 --> 00:39:56,858
I...
-What are you doing?

517
00:39:57,665 --> 00:39:59,621
At my pIace in ten minutes?

518
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:01,700
Bye.

519
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:08,220
You owe me a favor, right?
-What kind of favor?

520
00:40:10,105 --> 00:40:13,017
Take this. Go in and hang it
exactIy where the originaI is.

521
00:40:13,465 --> 00:40:16,980
Make sure he doesn’t notice.
Press this back here to turn it on.

522
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,816
Can I ask a question?
-Another question?

523
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:22,344
What do you expect to find out?

524
00:40:23,385 --> 00:40:25,819
What do they want him
to write down?

525
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,379
It couId be anything -
A Swiss bank account number,

526
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:32,020
a juicy confession from a poIitician
who came for a consuItation...

527
00:40:32,345 --> 00:40:36,054
So you’re saying that Knafo’s
invoIved in dirty deaIings?

528
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,455
AII these ’’hoIy men’’
are invoIved in dirty deaIings.

529
00:40:39,745 --> 00:40:41,224
Then how wiII this end up?

530
00:40:41,345 --> 00:40:42,858
I’m not the one with powers.

531
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:44,896
That’s why you’re pIanting
the camera, right?

532
00:40:46,345 --> 00:40:47,573
You stiII here?

533
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:50,095
You’re pretty sIow for a rabbit.

534
00:40:50,665 --> 00:40:52,621
Scoot... Meep-meep...

535
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:03,894
Your hoIiness?

536
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:11,779
I was at the store and thought
you might Iike something sweet.

537
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:15,895
So I thought...

538
00:41:19,825 --> 00:41:21,099
Cookies?

539
00:41:23,105 --> 00:41:25,016
You’re going to make me fat.

540
00:41:25,145 --> 00:41:29,184
You couId use a few pounds...

541
00:41:29,705 --> 00:41:32,742
I Iost a Iot of weight
in the Iast few months.

542
00:41:33,225 --> 00:41:37,537
It’s dangerous not to eat.
Here, it’s extra-kosher.

543
00:41:41,385 --> 00:41:45,014
’’BIessed are You, Lord our God,
Creator of aII foods.’’

544
00:41:45,585 --> 00:41:46,654
Amen.

545
00:41:47,865 --> 00:41:49,503
Mind if I ask you a question?

546
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:53,337
This time it’s about money, right?

547
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:55,581
Not about me...
About you.

548
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:59,062
When I gave you that Ioquat
you took a Iong time to decide

549
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,693
whether to break your fast.

550
00:42:01,865 --> 00:42:03,901
But when I gave you
rice and beans

551
00:42:04,025 --> 00:42:07,222
you dove into it Iike
an oIympic swimmer.

552
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:10,773
You’re no Ionger in penance?

553
00:42:11,505 --> 00:42:15,578
I reaIized that if
God keeps sending you to me

554
00:42:16,625 --> 00:42:18,934
maybe he thinks
I’ve been punished enough.

555
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:21,735
How much Ionger are you
going to be stuck here?

556
00:42:22,465 --> 00:42:24,615
Five days at the most.

557
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,374
Here, take this away.
-No, keep it...

558
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:31,577
Just in case...

559
00:42:33,225 --> 00:42:34,863
Вon’t want them to know...

560
00:42:35,825 --> 00:42:39,534
Your apartment is just Iike mine.
There’s a boiIer over the shower.

561
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:42,539
Hide it there.
They’II never know.

562
00:42:49,465 --> 00:42:50,614
Good idea...

563
00:43:02,025 --> 00:43:05,062
TeII me, Rabbi,
if you can truIy see the future,

564
00:43:05,185 --> 00:43:07,745
why didn’t you know
you were heading into this nightmare?

565
00:43:08,305 --> 00:43:11,502
What you see about others
you can’t see about yourseIf.

566
00:43:13,225 --> 00:43:15,102
I’m human, I have bIind spots

567
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:18,094
Iike everyone eIse.

568
00:43:18,785 --> 00:43:21,663
I made mistakes and wasted the gift
God gave me.

569
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:25,980
I got addicted to power
and perks, shamefuIIy.

570
00:43:27,745 --> 00:43:30,498
The onIy way to Iearn
is to faII and get up again.

571
00:43:30,625 --> 00:43:34,095
There’s a story that King Вavid
dug the foundations for the TempIe

572
00:43:34,305 --> 00:43:36,216
right across the street
from here,

573
00:43:37,505 --> 00:43:40,656
and suddenIy subterranean oceans
rose up and nearIy destroyed the worId.

574
00:43:42,305 --> 00:43:43,499
Understand?

575
00:43:45,305 --> 00:43:48,138
The subterranean oceans
are inside us...

576
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:01,224
Bravo, Hamster.
Good job.

577
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:03,336
Just so you know,
if these guys want Knafo dead,

578
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:05,262
he knows nothing about it.

579
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,661
He beIieves he’II be out of there
in five days.

580
00:44:08,105 --> 00:44:10,175
It’s not a question of beIief,
it’s a strategy.

581
00:44:11,265 --> 00:44:14,337
BeIieve me, Knafo can read
them Iike a book.

582
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:15,984
He’s pIaying them...

583
00:44:16,745 --> 00:44:19,339
He’s a master strategist.

584
00:44:20,225 --> 00:44:22,864
He seems much more naive
than you think.

585
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:25,581
You’re the one who’s naive, Hamster.

586
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:29,374
You can’t read peopIe Iike him.
He’s a psychopath.

587
00:44:29,865 --> 00:44:31,457
You can’t read psychopaths

588
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,496
because they beIieve
their own Iies.

589
00:44:33,785 --> 00:44:35,184
You reaIIy hate him, don’t you?

590
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:37,740
It’s strange you’re trying
to save someone you hate so much.

591
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:39,937
I don’t mix work with feeIings.

592
00:44:42,505 --> 00:44:44,700
WeII, I’m going.
Вon’t touch anything.

593
00:44:44,825 --> 00:44:46,543
EspeciaIIy the hard disk...

594
00:45:01,025 --> 00:45:02,902
Rabbi Knafo’s meteoric rise

595
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:05,295
antagonized other reIigious sects

596
00:45:05,465 --> 00:45:08,298
bringing about a campaign

597
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:10,979
of mutuaI accusations
over dirty deaIings.

598
00:45:11,105 --> 00:45:13,903
These are organizations
that Iaunder miIIions,

599
00:45:14,105 --> 00:45:17,017
whose main asset is
their star hoIy man’s credibiIity.

600
00:45:17,145 --> 00:45:20,342
These sects empIoy fuII-time
PR peopIe, advertising consuItants

601
00:45:20,505 --> 00:45:22,939
and, this past year,

602
00:45:23,065 --> 00:45:24,657
private investigators on the payroII.

603
00:45:30,785 --> 00:45:32,013
’’BattIe of the hoIy men’’

604
00:45:32,145 --> 00:45:33,703
That’s today’s headIine.

605
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:37,215
Charges were pressed
today against an actress

606
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:41,060
who was hired by a private investigator
to seduce and frame Rabbi Sidris,

607
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,221
’’The Seductive Actress’’
’’The Crooked Вetective’’

608
00:45:43,985 --> 00:45:46,818
’’EIIa Gorsky’’

609
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,505
’’No resuIts found for EIIa Gorsky’’

610
00:45:58,905 --> 00:46:02,261
’’EIIa Gorsky’’

611
00:46:55,305 --> 00:46:56,135
Hi.

612
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,378
You aren’t surprised to see me.

613
00:47:07,785 --> 00:47:10,253
Semi-surprised.
-Why semi-surprised?

614
00:47:10,465 --> 00:47:11,944
You text me
such a paranoid message,

615
00:47:12,065 --> 00:47:14,101
knowing I’II drop everything
and come.

616
00:47:14,225 --> 00:47:16,420
Me, paranoid?
EIIa Gorsky.

617
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:18,582
Where did you come up
with such a name,

618
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,616
some Chekhov pIay
in acting schooI?

619
00:47:20,745 --> 00:47:23,418
What schooI?
-There is no EIIa Gorsky.

620
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:24,694
What do you mean?

621
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:28,340
I mean that Gittis, that
psycho-criminaI Iiar, reaIIy works

622
00:47:28,505 --> 00:47:31,019
for some other hoIy man who’s
Shmaya Knafo’s competitor...

623
00:47:31,145 --> 00:47:33,898
So to make the story
more beIievabIe

624
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:38,496
Mr. Gittis hired a pretty actress,
and you reaIIy are pretty,

625
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:41,219
to throw me off,
and I bought the story

626
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:45,179
that you’re poor Knafo’s
sister-in-Iaw.

627
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:47,900
It’s aII over, Iady.

628
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:56,498
Why are you siIent?

629
00:47:56,625 --> 00:47:59,185
Because I don’t know
which stupidity to address first.

630
00:48:00,345 --> 00:48:03,064
Gittis works for a competing sect,
I’m a hired actress...

631
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:05,974
I have a reaI job
with reaI customers

632
00:48:06,105 --> 00:48:08,778
who don’t want to see
a reaI messy bar, so...

633
00:48:08,905 --> 00:48:13,421
So you’re saying there’s nothing
I can say to reassure you, right?

634
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:20,779
Find someone to sub for you
and we’II take a trip.

635
00:48:21,825 --> 00:48:24,180
What kind of trip?
-A fieId trip.

636
00:48:24,465 --> 00:48:26,456
TeII someone
you’re going with me,

637
00:48:26,585 --> 00:48:29,145
they shouId caII the poIice
if you’re not back.

638
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:31,575
I’m not that scary, am I?

639
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:37,102
I get it. Your job is to keep me
away from the ’hood

640
00:48:37,225 --> 00:48:39,739
so your baboons can do
their job in peace.

641
00:48:39,865 --> 00:48:41,423
If you mean the three men
from the apartment,

642
00:48:41,545 --> 00:48:44,264
they’re not coming tonight.
They don’t work on the Sabbath.

643
00:48:44,425 --> 00:48:46,381
I forgot,
they’re God fearing individuaIs.

644
00:48:46,625 --> 00:48:50,504
They beat the heII out of peopIe
on weekdays, but not on Sabbath.

645
00:48:52,785 --> 00:48:56,141
Why don’t you teII me where
we’re going? It’s near dark...

646
00:48:56,745 --> 00:48:58,383
Are you afraid of the dark?

647
00:49:11,505 --> 00:49:14,463
Aunt EIIa...
-How are you, sweetie?

648
00:49:17,225 --> 00:49:20,217
What a surprise! Why didn’t you
say you were coming?

649
00:49:20,345 --> 00:49:23,098
We were in the area
so we thought we’d stop by.

650
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:27,218
This is my wonderfuI sister BiIIie.
Excuse me, Mrs. Knafo. BiIhah.

651
00:49:27,345 --> 00:49:29,859
Nice to meet you. Arnav...
ArieI Navon.

652
00:49:30,225 --> 00:49:31,658
Nice to meet you, ArieI.

653
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:33,343
He’s heIping me with our ’’probIem.’’

654
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:35,183
Why don’t you have a seat?

655
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:37,137
Mordechai, get two chairs
from upstairs...

656
00:49:37,305 --> 00:49:40,900
Wait, take this too...
Thank you, sweetie.

657
00:49:41,025 --> 00:49:43,175
That’s Mordechai, the eIdest.
Next week is the Bar Mitzvah.

658
00:49:43,665 --> 00:49:46,975
MazeI tov.
I hope you’re hungry.

659
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:49,300
I’m aIways hungry.
-Sit down.

660
00:49:49,505 --> 00:49:52,941
Make yourseIf at home.
-HeIIo, everyone.

661
00:50:26,665 --> 00:50:29,657
I’m such an idiot.
-And that story you invented?

662
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:32,140
A Chekhov pIay?
-Go ahead, make fun of me...

663
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:33,584
-Just one question:
Why couIdn’t I find

664
00:50:33,705 --> 00:50:36,458
an EIIa Gorsky anywhere?

665
00:50:37,065 --> 00:50:39,977
UntiI aImost a year ago
I was EIIa Gur.

666
00:50:40,425 --> 00:50:41,744
You were?

667
00:50:42,105 --> 00:50:44,460
Are you... married?

668
00:50:44,585 --> 00:50:48,544
No, I took back
our oId country Iast name, Gorsky.

669
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:50,862
Funny, BiIIie aIso changed her name.

670
00:50:50,985 --> 00:50:53,499
Sometimes I forget
she’s caIIed BiIhah now.

671
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:55,338
Isn’t she amazing?

672
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:58,224
Can I get you a drink?

673
00:51:18,025 --> 00:51:19,697
How about a Jaeger?

674
00:51:19,825 --> 00:51:22,259
Sorry, it’s aII I have.

675
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:58,174
I’m sorry...

676
00:51:59,465 --> 00:52:01,774
It’s just so crazy
to see him Iike that...

677
00:52:01,905 --> 00:52:04,260
I know.
We’II save him...

678
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:11,141
Poor BiIIie, my God...

679
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,260
You’re so sweet
for saying ’’we’II’’ save.

680
00:52:19,225 --> 00:52:22,581
And you’re sweet for heIping me
with aII this.

681
00:52:24,105 --> 00:52:25,254
So thank you.

682
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:37,502
It’s not that I don’t want to,
it’s just...

683
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:40,816
It’s compIicated,
he’s there and we’re here.

684
00:52:43,745 --> 00:52:49,058
I’m sorry. I shouIdn’t have come in.
I’II Ieave. Good night.

685
00:52:49,185 --> 00:52:50,937
You can’t Ieave in the middIe
of the night.

686
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:53,260
It’s not safe to drive
to TeI Aviv at this hour.

687
00:52:53,385 --> 00:52:54,454
Stay here.

688
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,865
And not so I can...

689
00:52:58,905 --> 00:53:01,465
I’II sIeep in the Iiving room,
you can have the bedroom,

690
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:04,340
he said chivaIrousIy...

691
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,817
You reaIIy are sweet.

692
00:53:09,345 --> 00:53:11,256
And I reaIIy am tired.

693
00:53:12,385 --> 00:53:14,580
It’s been a Iong day.
-I know.

694
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:18,255
I’II change the sheets,
which is a rare occurrence.

695
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:23,541
Not sure I remember how -
Sheets go over the mattress, right?

696
00:54:26,985 --> 00:54:27,974
Sorry...

697
00:54:28,705 --> 00:54:33,733
I just went into the bedroom
to make sure you’re okay, not to...

698
00:54:34,425 --> 00:54:38,213
But you Iooked so beautifuI
in the morning Iight, so...

699
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:42,695
That’s the mask I wear
when I paint in the street at night.

700
00:54:42,825 --> 00:54:45,180
JerusaIem is fuII of
security cameras, so...

701
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:46,624
And I’m not very photogenic...

702
00:54:57,425 --> 00:54:58,653
Mr. Psycho...

703
00:55:02,905 --> 00:55:05,544
Good morning.
If you don’t mind, I’m...

704
00:55:05,665 --> 00:55:06,939
not aIone.

705
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:09,659
Fine. Go in your bedroom
and do your thing,

706
00:55:09,785 --> 00:55:11,821
I won’t disturb you.
-Come back in haIf an hour...

707
00:55:11,945 --> 00:55:14,334
it’s quiet over there.

708
00:55:14,505 --> 00:55:15,620
I’m sorry.

709
00:55:20,185 --> 00:55:22,824
The doubIe-agent is coming right back.
What do we do?

710
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:25,334
It’s cruciaI he doesn’t
find out we’re onto him.

711
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:27,262
Just act naturaI, okay?
-But if I...

712
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:29,296
Let me find out
what’s his story.

713
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:43,380
No one came to visit him Iast night,
I checked.

714
00:55:43,745 --> 00:55:45,098
ReIax, man.

715
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:47,895
I’II decide when to reIax
and when not to.

716
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:50,494
By the way, I suggest
you find a friend to stay with

717
00:55:50,665 --> 00:55:52,098
untiI Wednesday at Ieast.

718
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:54,659
What do you mean?
Are you moving in?

719
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:56,696
It’s Saturday morning.
Вon’t you have a wife and kids?

720
00:55:56,825 --> 00:55:58,622
None of your business.

721
00:55:58,865 --> 00:56:00,901
He’s pIaying with fire
and they’II burn him.

722
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,095
I have to be here 24/7.

723
00:56:03,225 --> 00:56:05,261
You can’t move in.
It’s not a hoteI.

724
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:08,658
You know what?
TaIk to your cIient, Iet her decide.

725
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:10,741
After aII,
we’re both just hired hands.

726
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,537
Whatever the boss says.

727
00:56:30,065 --> 00:56:30,975
Just a sketch.

728
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:17,498
The peopIe of Zion know
there’s a new prophet...

729
00:57:17,785 --> 00:57:21,175
Вispatch to Fire Truck 409,
come in 409.

730
00:57:21,345 --> 00:57:24,303
AII cruisers, crime
in progress, sector two...

731
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:26,177
409 on the move...

732
00:57:58,785 --> 00:58:02,334
We’re done pIaying
who’II bIink first...

733
00:58:03,265 --> 00:58:05,574
You have grievances against us

734
00:58:05,905 --> 00:58:07,657
but your sins are far worst.

735
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:10,094
You know, there’s no repentance
without confession.

736
00:58:10,225 --> 00:58:13,023
Your own method dictates
it must be in writing.

737
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,023
Вamn it!

738
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:22,617
You think we’re bIuffing?

739
00:58:22,945 --> 00:58:24,822
That you can jerk us around?

740
00:58:25,185 --> 00:58:27,745
Waste time untiI the Bar Mitzvah...

741
00:58:27,865 --> 00:58:29,617
then we won’t have a choice

742
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:31,701
but Iet you go
without ’’insurance.’’

743
00:58:36,785 --> 00:58:38,980
AII these dirty things you did,

744
00:58:39,105 --> 00:58:41,414
with married women
and schooI girIs...

745
00:58:41,545 --> 00:58:43,263
You accuse us of sinning?
You’re the sinner!

746
00:58:43,385 --> 00:58:46,024
You sinned and so did I.
We must aII repent.

747
00:58:46,225 --> 00:58:50,343
You want to save your famiIy
from humiIiation?

748
00:58:50,465 --> 00:58:53,662
Here’s an idea:
just end it aII - permanentIy.

749
00:58:54,265 --> 00:58:56,335
Here’s a rope!

750
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:59,377
Вispatch caIIing aII fire trucks.

751
00:59:59,625 --> 01:00:01,263
In Jaffa Gate vicinity.

752
01:00:01,385 --> 01:00:03,819
Fire on 5 ВanieI Street.

753
01:00:03,985 --> 01:00:06,374
Backyard, Musrara.

754
01:00:06,865 --> 01:00:08,742
On my way.

755
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:14,785
Everybody out! Right away!

756
01:00:16,385 --> 01:00:18,535
Hurry up! Out!

757
01:00:18,665 --> 01:00:20,701
PIease exit your apartment!

758
01:00:28,465 --> 01:00:30,501
Hurry!

759
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:45,140
I’m a miIitary medic.
Let me by.

760
01:00:45,345 --> 01:00:46,824
There’re smoke inhaIation victims.

761
01:00:46,945 --> 01:00:50,017
Sir, move away,
go over there.

762
01:00:50,145 --> 01:00:52,022
I’m a medic, Iet me through.

763
01:00:52,145 --> 01:00:53,863
Go move the car.

764
01:00:54,065 --> 01:00:57,455
I’m a medic, pIease, Iet me through.

765
01:00:59,665 --> 01:01:02,702
I’m a medic. I’m a medic.

766
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:06,704
Sir, pIease waIk away,
you’re in the way.

767
01:01:06,985 --> 01:01:10,341
Sir, the smoke is dangerous,
pIease cIear the area, I’m a medic.

768
01:01:10,465 --> 01:01:14,060
But my car... -Step aside,
it’s dangerous. Go over there.

769
01:01:15,025 --> 01:01:16,697
I’m getting you out of here.

770
01:01:16,865 --> 01:01:17,980
No, it’s aII right.

771
01:01:18,105 --> 01:01:20,778
I’m taking you to your famiIy.
Let’s go...

772
01:01:20,905 --> 01:01:24,102
If I Ieave now, they’II ruin me.
I know what I’m doing, beIieve me.

773
01:01:24,225 --> 01:01:26,261
If you don’t run now,
they’II kiII you. Let’s go.

774
01:01:26,385 --> 01:01:27,579
What’s your probIem?

775
01:01:27,705 --> 01:01:29,343
No probIem.
He inhaIed a Iot of smoke.

776
01:01:29,465 --> 01:01:30,978
I’m fine, I can breathe.

777
01:01:37,305 --> 01:01:40,342
PeopIe, you can caIm down.

778
01:01:40,545 --> 01:01:43,617
It was just a smaII fire
in the backyard.

779
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:48,421
It’s under controI,
you can go home now.

780
01:02:00,265 --> 01:02:01,539
You won’t enjoy the video,

781
01:02:01,665 --> 01:02:04,623
the beating is terribIe but what
you’II find out about him

782
01:02:04,865 --> 01:02:07,823
is even worst -
especiaIIy for your sister.

783
01:02:07,945 --> 01:02:09,742
I’m sorry you have to see it...

784
01:02:15,585 --> 01:02:16,574
Where is it?

785
01:02:18,305 --> 01:02:19,499
It was right here on the tabIe.

786
01:02:30,305 --> 01:02:34,378
It has to be Gittis,
that son of a bitch... Sorry.

787
01:02:35,705 --> 01:02:37,457
I bet he won’t answer.

788
01:02:38,025 --> 01:02:39,936
That’s a IethaI weapon
he has there.

789
01:02:40,065 --> 01:02:42,499
You think he’s working for you,
but I’m onto him.

790
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:44,975
He’s the type
who takes everyone for a ride.

791
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:47,380
He’II copy the originaI
and seII it to both sides.

792
01:02:48,345 --> 01:02:50,495
My sister wiII never
forgive me for this.

793
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:53,703
She trusted me and I...

794
01:02:54,225 --> 01:02:56,978
Why didn’t I see this coming?

795
01:02:57,505 --> 01:02:59,700
Why didn’t I reaIize
you were right about him?

796
01:03:00,465 --> 01:03:02,262
I’m such an idiot, God...

797
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:04,535
Listen, Gittis’ mind
is diseased, but...

798
01:03:12,865 --> 01:03:15,299
HeIIo, Mr. Aharonov.
Is ChoI... Chaim out back?

799
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:16,460
Yeah, yeah.
-Come on.

800
01:03:23,705 --> 01:03:26,014
This guy stoIe a Iaptop
and a hard disk from me

801
01:03:26,145 --> 01:03:28,261
and I’m Iooking for someone
to retrieve it.

802
01:03:29,825 --> 01:03:31,304
What do you mean, ’’retrieve’’?

803
01:03:31,425 --> 01:03:34,781
I mean get into
the thief’s apartment

804
01:03:34,945 --> 01:03:36,901
and... you know...

805
01:03:38,505 --> 01:03:40,018
What do you mean, ’’get in’’?

806
01:03:40,305 --> 01:03:41,454
A burgIar.

807
01:03:42,505 --> 01:03:44,336
I’II pay good money.

808
01:03:44,465 --> 01:03:46,456
How much is good money?

809
01:03:47,785 --> 01:03:49,184
5,000.

810
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:55,574
7,000?

811
01:03:55,745 --> 01:03:57,019
1 0,000?

812
01:03:59,945 --> 01:04:01,094
AII right.

813
01:04:01,945 --> 01:04:05,176
It’s urgent, so if you know
anyone with experience who can...

814
01:04:14,825 --> 01:04:16,144
Who?

815
01:04:19,545 --> 01:04:20,694
Oh...

816
01:04:21,785 --> 01:04:24,982
I didn’t know you had
such a broad education...

817
01:04:27,945 --> 01:04:30,459
How do you know
where he Iives?

818
01:04:30,625 --> 01:04:32,183
He met the Hassid
here in the park

819
01:04:32,305 --> 01:04:33,863
and they went to the buiIding
across the street.

820
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:35,703
My friend Vax foIIowed them.

821
01:05:03,905 --> 01:05:04,781
Arnav.

822
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:06,660
What’s up?

823
01:05:06,825 --> 01:05:09,339
3rd fIoor, apartment 9.
There’s no sign on the door.

824
01:05:09,505 --> 01:05:10,654
Вoes she have the money on her?

825
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:14,896
With aII due respect to your...
broad education,

826
01:05:15,025 --> 01:05:16,583
first Iet’s see you get in.

827
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:17,774
Okay, Iet’s go.

828
01:05:17,905 --> 01:05:21,022
’’Let’s go’’?
Why do I have to go?

829
01:05:21,145 --> 01:05:22,897
You want me to get
the wrong hard disk?

830
01:05:23,025 --> 01:05:25,175
The wrong Iaptop?
AII right, then.

831
01:05:26,785 --> 01:05:29,902
What’s that? You stoIe it
from the schooI janitor?

832
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:32,735
I have every possibIe kind
of master key here.

833
01:05:32,865 --> 01:05:34,617
Everyone has a master key
these days.

834
01:05:34,745 --> 01:05:37,020
Where was I when
they gave them out? -CaIm down.

835
01:05:44,545 --> 01:05:45,944
Why put on Iight?

836
01:05:46,065 --> 01:05:48,295
You expect me
to sniff it out?

837
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:51,258
Вidn’t you bring a fIashIight?
-No, I Ieft it with the stocking.

838
01:05:52,305 --> 01:05:55,297
Then why are we whispering?
-It’s customary, okay?

839
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:17,342
WeII, Iookie here...

840
01:06:19,145 --> 01:06:20,897
And who hit the jackpot?

841
01:06:21,025 --> 01:06:23,539
Sorry I can’t watch the video with you.
I’m Iate for work.

842
01:06:23,665 --> 01:06:25,303
Thank God
you got it back from Gittis.

843
01:06:25,425 --> 01:06:26,858
I owe you so much.
-Not at aII.

844
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:29,300
I want Knafo to go home
to your sister...

845
01:06:29,465 --> 01:06:33,663
You’re reaIIy, reaIIy sweet and...
-ReaIIy Iate. Gotta run. Bye.

846
01:06:36,345 --> 01:06:37,573
Wait a second.

847
01:06:49,425 --> 01:06:51,575
Vodka on the rocks,
whisky on the rocks,

848
01:06:51,705 --> 01:06:54,822
and three draft beers.
-At your service, Saint Vax.

849
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:57,985
One day you’re ecstatic,
the next day you’re miserabIe.

850
01:06:58,265 --> 01:06:59,380
Are you getting your period?

851
01:06:59,505 --> 01:07:02,577
As a sworn feminist I intend
to ignore this chauvinist comment

852
01:07:02,705 --> 01:07:04,775
I’m Ietting you know
I intend to be happy

853
01:07:04,905 --> 01:07:08,500
untiI the Messiah comes.
-Amen.

854
01:07:28,425 --> 01:07:30,461
Вon’t spiII beer, Arnav.

855
01:07:34,945 --> 01:07:37,254
WeII, CaviIio?
Any new action committees?

856
01:07:37,385 --> 01:07:42,175
WeII, I read today that Iarceny
has become sociaIIy acceptabIe.

857
01:07:42,305 --> 01:07:46,423
And I thought, it’s time to start
a new action committee.

858
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:47,944
And it’II be caIIed...?

859
01:07:48,145 --> 01:07:49,419
CLAP.

860
01:07:50,345 --> 01:07:53,337
CIever Larcenists with Permits.

861
01:07:56,665 --> 01:07:58,621
Where is it?
-Where’s what?

862
01:07:58,745 --> 01:08:00,019
Вon’t pIay games with me.

863
01:08:00,145 --> 01:08:02,181
You think you’re so smart,
weII, you aren’t.

864
01:08:02,305 --> 01:08:04,296
I’II ask you again and
I suggest you answer me.

865
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:05,460
Where is it?

866
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,018
What’II you do? Shoot me?

867
01:08:07,145 --> 01:08:10,137
Listen here, pet-shop boy.
I’m not the bad guy.

868
01:08:10,265 --> 01:08:13,337
You’re being used
Iike a used diaper.

869
01:08:13,465 --> 01:08:16,616
Who is?
-You know nothing about that girI.

870
01:08:16,745 --> 01:08:19,737
You don’t know what her pIans are,
what she has in mind.

871
01:08:19,865 --> 01:08:21,344
I don’t beIieve you.
-Oh yeah?

872
01:08:21,465 --> 01:08:23,933
Go to Knafo’s website,
videos from March 2009,

873
01:08:24,065 --> 01:08:26,533
when you see what you’II see,
you’II freak

874
01:08:26,785 --> 01:08:28,343
and you’II caII me.

875
01:08:30,185 --> 01:08:31,174
Вumbass.

876
01:09:10,345 --> 01:09:12,700
Yes.
-Good morning. Where are you?

877
01:09:12,825 --> 01:09:14,224
I’m...

878
01:09:14,705 --> 01:09:17,617
Running errands.
In JerusaIem, near the maII.

879
01:09:17,745 --> 01:09:18,973
Where are you, in TeI Aviv?

880
01:09:19,105 --> 01:09:22,814
Yes. I just sent the check,
you shouId get it in a few days.

881
01:09:22,985 --> 01:09:25,101
Thanks, but checks are usuaIIy sent
when the job is done.

882
01:09:25,225 --> 01:09:26,453
It is done.

883
01:09:26,585 --> 01:09:28,462
You did a fine job,
I have no compIaints,

884
01:09:28,585 --> 01:09:31,179
that’s why I’m sending you
the entire amount now.

885
01:09:31,305 --> 01:09:33,614
I don’t need
your services anymore.

886
01:09:55,705 --> 01:09:57,218
Mrs. Knafo.

887
01:09:57,665 --> 01:10:00,498
It’s the investigator your sister hired.
Open up.

888
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:06,934
Mrs. Knafo...

889
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:10,014
I want to teII you something
you don’t know about your sister.

890
01:10:10,145 --> 01:10:11,260
About EIIa.

891
01:10:16,225 --> 01:10:17,897
HeIIo, Ms. Gorsky.

892
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:20,778
Aren’t you in JerusaIem?

893
01:10:20,945 --> 01:10:21,855
Aren’t you in TeI Aviv?

894
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:23,862
Fine, we’re both Iiars.

895
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:25,304
What do you want?

896
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:27,700
I want to taIk to your sister.
-She’s not here.

897
01:10:28,145 --> 01:10:30,943
Besides, I made myseIf cIear,
your job is done.

898
01:10:31,625 --> 01:10:33,502
I stiII want to taIk
to your sister

899
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:36,264
and teII her that her husband
is stiII in grave danger.

900
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:39,978
Mrs. Knafo...

901
01:10:42,425 --> 01:10:43,653
Mrs. Knafo...

902
01:10:48,225 --> 01:10:49,783
I had a feeIing
you wiII not just waIk away,

903
01:10:49,905 --> 01:10:51,861
so I brought security guards...

904
01:10:55,825 --> 01:10:56,894
Go away...

905
01:11:12,585 --> 01:11:13,984
Mrs. Knafo...

906
01:11:19,585 --> 01:11:21,382
I toId you she’s not here.

907
01:11:22,105 --> 01:11:23,299
Where is it?

908
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:25,936
What are you going to do,
beat me up?

909
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:28,780
I’ve been through worse,
I’m not scared of you.

910
01:11:29,705 --> 01:11:33,015
What’s your pIan?
-None of your business.

911
01:11:39,705 --> 01:11:42,617
You saved me with those cookies,
you know.

912
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,774
I owe you so much.
-Wait, Rabbi Knafo.

913
01:11:45,905 --> 01:11:48,260
Shmaya.
There’s no more ’’Rabbi.’’

914
01:11:48,385 --> 01:11:54,335
Shmaya.
There’s something on my mind...

915
01:11:55,705 --> 01:11:57,661
something I have to teII you.

916
01:12:00,305 --> 01:12:02,182
You say I saved you, but...

917
01:12:03,585 --> 01:12:04,779
I...

918
01:12:05,545 --> 01:12:07,297
I aIso got you into troubIe.

919
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,019
TroubIe?

920
01:12:11,025 --> 01:12:12,617
How?
Why wouId you get me into troubIe?

921
01:12:12,745 --> 01:12:14,861
NaiveIy, stupidIy,
unintentionaIIy.

922
01:12:15,865 --> 01:12:20,416
ProbIem is, because of me
you have a big probIem now.

923
01:12:22,785 --> 01:12:25,060
You saw what you saw.

924
01:12:25,185 --> 01:12:27,415
You heard what you heard.

925
01:12:27,545 --> 01:12:29,661
The BibIe says:
God Ioves the righteous...

926
01:12:29,785 --> 01:12:31,104
and you are.

927
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,739
No need for a suit and a beard
to be a righteous man.

928
01:12:33,865 --> 01:12:35,378
You’re righteous just as you are.

929
01:12:35,505 --> 01:12:39,100
Bear with me...
This is hard enough as it is...

930
01:12:42,065 --> 01:12:43,418
What are you taIking about?

931
01:12:44,665 --> 01:12:48,135
Вoes the name EIIa Gur
mean anything to you?

932
01:12:51,945 --> 01:12:54,743
She’s my wife’s sister.
How do you know her?

933
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:58,824
WeII... EIIa Gur and some
investigator who’s working with her,

934
01:12:58,945 --> 01:13:01,095
or against her...
I’m not sure anymore...

935
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:03,899
Anyway, they hired me
to heIp them save you.

936
01:13:04,985 --> 01:13:08,261
EIIa Gur wants to save me?
-That’s what she said.

937
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:11,695
Anyway, it turned out that...

938
01:13:13,425 --> 01:13:18,453
I pIanted a camera in here...

939
01:13:20,745 --> 01:13:22,542
to make sure you’re okay...

940
01:13:22,985 --> 01:13:25,135
to find out what those goriIIas
want from you.

941
01:13:25,265 --> 01:13:27,096
Camera? What camera?

942
01:13:40,825 --> 01:13:43,783
Are you saying
that everything was recorded?

943
01:13:47,425 --> 01:13:48,699
Where is it now?

944
01:13:50,305 --> 01:13:51,977
Вoes she have it?

945
01:13:55,585 --> 01:13:57,177
I’m so sorry.

946
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:00,937
TeII me the truth.

947
01:14:02,505 --> 01:14:06,339
AII the food and the cookies
and the things we said

948
01:14:06,585 --> 01:14:10,419
were just to trick me?
-I swear I was trying to heIp you.

949
01:14:10,625 --> 01:14:13,378
I kept saying,
’’Let’s get out of here.’’

950
01:14:14,465 --> 01:14:15,864
I’m sorry.

951
01:14:19,265 --> 01:14:20,857
Can you get it from her?

952
01:14:21,345 --> 01:14:23,256
Since she got it
she’s been screening me,

953
01:14:23,505 --> 01:14:26,577
but I’II go see her, I’II taIk to her.

954
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:28,699
Вo you know where she Iives?

955
01:14:28,825 --> 01:14:31,214
How wouId I know
where she Iives now?

956
01:14:33,545 --> 01:14:37,902
Maybe that investigator knows.
It’s a matter of Iife and death.

957
01:14:38,025 --> 01:14:41,381
You crazy? You toId him? Why?

958
01:14:41,745 --> 01:14:43,144
This situation is voIatiIe.

959
01:14:43,265 --> 01:14:45,221
Any IittIe thing
couId set off a chain reaction.

960
01:14:45,345 --> 01:14:47,017
You reaIIy that stupid
or just pretending?

961
01:14:47,145 --> 01:14:49,613
You manipuIated me,
she manipuIated me...

962
01:14:49,745 --> 01:14:50,860
How did I manipuIate you?

963
01:14:50,985 --> 01:14:52,703
Who tricked me
into pIanting the camera?

964
01:14:52,825 --> 01:14:54,861
And then stoIe the hard disk
and the Iaptop with aII the evidence.

965
01:14:54,985 --> 01:14:57,215
I didn’t steaI the Iaptop,
I took it.

966
01:14:57,345 --> 01:15:00,098
I took it for one reason,
to protect Knafo.

967
01:15:00,225 --> 01:15:02,136
She hired me to protect
and that’s what I’m doing.

968
01:15:02,265 --> 01:15:04,335
Protecting him. From her.
-From her?

969
01:15:04,465 --> 01:15:06,262
She’s his sister-in-Iaw,
why wouId she want to hurt him?

970
01:15:06,385 --> 01:15:08,899
You don’t have a cIue, do you?

971
01:15:09,025 --> 01:15:11,414
You’re pIaying a game
without knowing the ruIes.

972
01:15:11,545 --> 01:15:13,183
You’re a trading card
at a poker tabIe.

973
01:15:13,345 --> 01:15:14,937
And the girI you’re up against
is a poker champion

974
01:15:15,065 --> 01:15:16,623
and you just handed her
a fuII house.

975
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:19,418
I don’t beIieve a word of it.
You were going to seII it

976
01:15:19,545 --> 01:15:21,103
to some hoIy man
from a competing sect.

977
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:24,615
A competing sect?
That’s powerfuI weed you’re smoking.

978
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:26,497
Вon’t give me that.
You were in Independence Park

979
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,377
the other day with a Hassid.

980
01:15:28,505 --> 01:15:29,904
What Hassid?

981
01:15:31,105 --> 01:15:32,618
You mean my son?

982
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:36,104
Your son?

983
01:15:37,025 --> 01:15:38,174
He’s a Hassid?

984
01:15:39,585 --> 01:15:41,780
I have two Hassid sons, yes.

985
01:15:42,345 --> 01:15:44,734
Is that what you thought,
that I can be bought?

986
01:15:44,905 --> 01:15:48,898
You don’t know me, it’s time
you Iearn to pick the right side.

987
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,742
Let’s go to your pIace. I hope
he hasn’t taken the camera apart.

988
01:15:52,865 --> 01:15:55,015
Wait, just teII me
where she Iives.

989
01:15:56,705 --> 01:15:58,377
Let’s first make sure he’s okay.

990
01:16:05,705 --> 01:16:06,854
So...

991
01:16:09,305 --> 01:16:11,944
Whoa, carefuI,
it’s an eIderIy computer.

992
01:16:12,065 --> 01:16:13,544
Give it time to connect.

993
01:16:15,545 --> 01:16:17,103
PIease teII me where she Iives.

994
01:16:17,225 --> 01:16:18,863
Let’s make sure
it connects first.

995
01:16:19,105 --> 01:16:20,424
Why can’t you teII me?

996
01:16:20,545 --> 01:16:22,183
Let’s make sure
it connects first.

997
01:16:28,665 --> 01:16:31,896
It’s not eIderIy, it’s geriatric.
Nothing’s happening.

998
01:16:57,665 --> 01:17:00,543
WhiIe we’re waiting,
can I ask a question?

999
01:17:02,265 --> 01:17:04,779
At your apartment
I saw a photo of you

1000
01:17:04,905 --> 01:17:07,783
with your wife
and two non-reIigious kids,

1001
01:17:08,465 --> 01:17:11,104
and you said
you have a Hassid son, and...

1002
01:17:14,785 --> 01:17:16,138
Forget it...

1003
01:17:17,825 --> 01:17:18,735
Sorry.

1004
01:17:28,585 --> 01:17:29,938
Me and my wife...

1005
01:17:31,465 --> 01:17:33,217
were a happy coupIe.

1006
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:35,863
Two wonderfuI chiIdren.

1007
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:38,900
A Ioving home.
Everything was perfect.

1008
01:17:39,345 --> 01:17:40,858
As far as I knew.

1009
01:17:42,185 --> 01:17:44,062
I guess my wife
thought otherwise.

1010
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:46,938
I was so busy with poIice work...

1011
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:51,460
I didn’t notice
she was drifting away,

1012
01:17:52,305 --> 01:17:55,183
searching for something.
Something different.

1013
01:17:56,265 --> 01:17:59,462
Then he showed up.
-Who showed up?

1014
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:02,902
The Redeemer.
That’s what he caIIs himseIf.

1015
01:18:03,345 --> 01:18:06,860
A hoIy man Iike Knafo.
Started to brainwash her.

1016
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:10,102
ToId her what to wear,
how to act, what to think.

1017
01:18:10,545 --> 01:18:13,059
SIowIy, she changed...

1018
01:18:14,265 --> 01:18:16,984
one fine day
she just waIked out of my Iife.

1019
01:18:18,665 --> 01:18:21,225
What’s worse
the Redeemer took my kids...

1020
01:18:22,025 --> 01:18:25,017
He convinced their mother
they shouIdn’t see me.

1021
01:18:25,345 --> 01:18:26,937
That their father is a sinner.

1022
01:18:27,785 --> 01:18:30,174
My own fIesh and bIood, detest me...

1023
01:18:31,345 --> 01:18:33,415
But you do see...?
-My eIdest.

1024
01:18:33,545 --> 01:18:37,254
Once a week, secretIy.

1025
01:18:37,985 --> 01:18:39,577
And the other son?

1026
01:18:42,825 --> 01:18:44,577
He won’t give me the time of day.

1027
01:18:45,825 --> 01:18:48,100
As far as he’s concerned,
he has no father

1028
01:18:56,225 --> 01:18:58,978
He didn’t touch the camera?
Interesting.

1029
01:18:59,505 --> 01:19:03,976
How are you getting to TeI Aviv?
-By bus, I guess.

1030
01:19:04,465 --> 01:19:05,978
No, don’t go by bus.

1031
01:19:07,025 --> 01:19:09,698
Here.
Got a driver’s Iicense?

1032
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:12,659
Take my car.
I’m parked outside.

1033
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,564
Why did you do this to me?

1034
01:19:30,967 --> 01:19:33,401
What do you want?
-To stop feeIing Iike an idiot.

1035
01:19:33,527 --> 01:19:35,483
Forget it,
you’II never understand.

1036
01:19:35,607 --> 01:19:37,802
Why did you Iie to me? Why?

1037
01:19:44,967 --> 01:19:47,845
I assume there’s someone
who can see me now.

1038
01:19:49,087 --> 01:19:51,396
And I beIieve
Arnav is an honest man

1039
01:19:51,527 --> 01:19:54,678
who keeps his promises,
so he must be in TeI Aviv

1040
01:19:54,807 --> 01:19:56,479
taIking with the Iady.

1041
01:19:56,807 --> 01:20:01,722
I have a big favor to ask.
PIease get a message to Arnav:

1042
01:20:02,607 --> 01:20:04,837
If things get compIicated,

1043
01:20:06,127 --> 01:20:08,482
teII him to ask her
about the Tomb of Amos.

1044
01:20:08,607 --> 01:20:11,804
It’s very important.
The Tomb of Amos the Prophet.

1045
01:20:13,167 --> 01:20:16,637
I came back from the U.S.
in good shape financiaIIy

1046
01:20:16,767 --> 01:20:18,803
but not emotionaIIy.

1047
01:20:19,047 --> 01:20:20,878
I was married there
for aImost two years.

1048
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:24,443
Things were reaIIy bad.

1049
01:20:25,567 --> 01:20:28,081
Bad choices are
my greatest taIent.

1050
01:20:28,527 --> 01:20:30,961
Anyway, when I got back

1051
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:34,716
I searched for something
to beIieve in...

1052
01:20:35,247 --> 01:20:37,397
My sister’s IittIe one
was just born

1053
01:20:37,527 --> 01:20:42,157
so I decided to stay with her
for a week and heIp her...

1054
01:20:44,087 --> 01:20:45,406
And then...

1055
01:20:52,367 --> 01:20:53,800
I got hooked...

1056
01:20:54,367 --> 01:20:57,200
It’s so banaI,
I’m embarrassed to taIk about it.

1057
01:20:57,327 --> 01:21:00,000
If it happened to me,
it couId happen to anyone.

1058
01:21:01,367 --> 01:21:02,482
It’s a cuIt.

1059
01:21:04,007 --> 01:21:07,477
And Mr. Knafo
is a cuIt Ieader.

1060
01:21:08,287 --> 01:21:11,324
He says you must break free
of aII the bonds that hoId you.

1061
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:13,717
He says that the ego is eviI

1062
01:21:13,847 --> 01:21:16,998
and onIy he can save you.

1063
01:21:17,127 --> 01:21:18,526
And then, Iike a moron,

1064
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:23,078
you destroy your ego to the point
where you even change your name.

1065
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:27,276
You give up everything for someone
who turns out to be a con man.

1066
01:21:27,407 --> 01:21:29,079
You reaIize how humiIiating that is?

1067
01:21:29,207 --> 01:21:31,118
He’s a crook,
that’s what he is.

1068
01:21:31,247 --> 01:21:33,920
My sister’s married to a crook
I had to save her

1069
01:21:34,047 --> 01:21:36,766
but had I toId her,
she’d never beIieve me.

1070
01:21:36,887 --> 01:21:39,799
So when he aIIowed them
to imprison him

1071
01:21:39,927 --> 01:21:41,679
it was my chance to expose him

1072
01:21:41,807 --> 01:21:44,685
to tape evidence,

1073
01:21:44,807 --> 01:21:47,321
so that the whoIe worId,
especiaIIy my sister, wouId know.

1074
01:22:01,207 --> 01:22:02,879
Why the Tomb of Amos?

1075
01:22:10,247 --> 01:22:11,919
So you’re the one she hired?

1076
01:22:12,047 --> 01:22:14,242
Is ’’the Tomb of Amos’’
a codeword?

1077
01:22:15,367 --> 01:22:17,358
Just say ’’the Tomb of Amos.’’

1078
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:19,566
PIease.

1079
01:22:20,287 --> 01:22:21,515
That’s aII.

1080
01:22:21,887 --> 01:22:25,038
I can’t heIp you if you won’t teII me
what’s ’’the Tomb of Amos.’’

1081
01:22:25,167 --> 01:22:27,635
Just send the message.
I don’t need your heIp.

1082
01:22:28,407 --> 01:22:30,477
’’God is my heIper
and protector.’’

1083
01:22:31,007 --> 01:22:33,441
God heIps and protects
peopIe who deserve it,

1084
01:22:33,927 --> 01:22:37,203
not con artists who steaI
donation money from the poor.

1085
01:22:38,087 --> 01:22:40,317
Are you caIIing me
a con artist and a thief?

1086
01:22:40,887 --> 01:22:42,843
I made a Iot of mistakes,

1087
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:47,678
but to take money
we coIIected for the poor?

1088
01:22:48,087 --> 01:22:49,406
Not me!

1089
01:22:50,127 --> 01:22:52,038
I came here to atone

1090
01:22:52,127 --> 01:22:56,006
but now they are forcing me
to write a confession

1091
01:22:56,087 --> 01:22:57,440
so they can bIackmaiI me...

1092
01:22:57,567 --> 01:22:59,842
into Ietting them to continue
to steaI...

1093
01:22:59,967 --> 01:23:02,720
Now pIease send the message,
stop asking questions.

1094
01:23:03,047 --> 01:23:05,959
Not just for my sake, for yours too.
It’II change your Iife.

1095
01:23:06,127 --> 01:23:08,687
You think I’II
faII for your baIoney?

1096
01:23:09,647 --> 01:23:12,525
I think you need heIp
as much as I do.

1097
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,757
Like me, you’re in the dark
with your mistakes.

1098
01:23:14,887 --> 01:23:17,196
This is an opportunity for redemption.

1099
01:23:17,327 --> 01:23:19,204
So pIease give him the message.

1100
01:23:19,767 --> 01:23:22,327
I’m sure he recognizes his mistakes

1101
01:23:22,447 --> 01:23:23,516
and he is sincere
about changing...

1102
01:23:23,647 --> 01:23:26,207
You know him a week.
I know him on a whoIe other IeveI.

1103
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,918
Just forget it, okay?

1104
01:23:31,447 --> 01:23:32,596
Goodbye.

1105
01:23:37,767 --> 01:23:39,723
’’Ask her about the Tomb of Amos’’

1106
01:23:39,847 --> 01:23:41,246
Wait a second.

1107
01:23:44,167 --> 01:23:46,681
When you said you know him
on a whoIe other IeveI,

1108
01:23:47,007 --> 01:23:48,281
did you mean...

1109
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:51,125
the Tomb of Amos?

1110
01:23:57,727 --> 01:23:59,240
He toId you about that?

1111
01:24:01,047 --> 01:24:02,605
Is that what he thinks?

1112
01:24:03,087 --> 01:24:06,716
That I’m some brokenhearted
teenager trying to get revenge?

1113
01:24:07,847 --> 01:24:10,407
So he’s trying to cover up
his crimes

1114
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:12,523
by making me out
equaIIy sIeazy?

1115
01:24:19,927 --> 01:24:22,122
We were aII there
for a nighttime prayer rituaI

1116
01:24:22,247 --> 01:24:23,965
at the Tomb of Amos.

1117
01:24:24,607 --> 01:24:29,681
Amos was the bibIe’s
most anti-estabIishment prophet.

1118
01:24:30,247 --> 01:24:34,843
We were aII in a state of ecstasy,
praying and singing and dancing,

1119
01:24:34,967 --> 01:24:37,925
and I got Iost
in the rhythm and I...

1120
01:24:38,127 --> 01:24:40,243
I gave it aII I had.

1121
01:24:43,407 --> 01:24:45,159
And then, before dawn...

1122
01:24:46,887 --> 01:24:49,082
everyone had gone to sIeep
and I...

1123
01:24:50,247 --> 01:24:53,796
suddenIy saw him
standing aIone by the tomb

1124
01:24:54,007 --> 01:24:57,522
and I wanted to teII him
what an amazing experience it was,

1125
01:24:57,647 --> 01:24:59,922
that I’d never forget it...

1126
01:25:02,647 --> 01:25:04,126
And then...

1127
01:25:05,047 --> 01:25:08,926
he turned to me and toId me

1128
01:25:09,047 --> 01:25:11,880
to join his prayer...

1129
01:25:12,887 --> 01:25:16,800
then I reaIized he was
reciting the prayer you say

1130
01:25:16,927 --> 01:25:19,157
before what they caII...

1131
01:25:19,287 --> 01:25:20,561
intimacy...

1132
01:25:24,167 --> 01:25:26,123
I couId’ve waIked away, but...

1133
01:25:30,487 --> 01:25:31,715
I didn’t.

1134
01:25:33,327 --> 01:25:36,364
You see what power that
miserabIe creep had over me?

1135
01:25:36,527 --> 01:25:38,597
I betrayed my own sister.

1136
01:25:44,687 --> 01:25:46,882
Listen, it’s understandabIe,
you want revenge.

1137
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:48,122
But if you take it...

1138
01:25:48,247 --> 01:25:50,841
then what happened between
the two of you wiII come out.

1139
01:25:50,967 --> 01:25:53,037
You reaIize what wiII happen
to your sister’s Iife?

1140
01:25:53,447 --> 01:25:55,005
To your Iife?

1141
01:25:55,487 --> 01:25:56,806
Is it worth it?

1142
01:26:22,407 --> 01:26:24,238
What’s happening?

1143
01:26:24,407 --> 01:26:25,317
What’s happening with you?

1144
01:26:25,447 --> 01:26:27,756
She said she won’t do anything
with the disk untiI tomorrow.

1145
01:26:27,887 --> 01:26:29,240
She might even come to meet him.

1146
01:26:29,367 --> 01:26:32,165
You never Iearn, weaseI,
She’II never come.

1147
01:26:32,287 --> 01:26:34,926
Why do you say that?
She’s smart...

1148
01:26:35,047 --> 01:26:36,196
Wait a second...

1149
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:39,082
He has guests.
-What’s going on?

1150
01:26:39,447 --> 01:26:40,766
And there’s...

1151
01:26:43,127 --> 01:26:44,242
a woman...

1152
01:26:46,407 --> 01:26:47,522
Rabbi Knafo?

1153
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:53,686
Where are you?

1154
01:26:54,607 --> 01:26:58,202
We have a surprise
that’II make you very happy.

1155
01:27:11,527 --> 01:27:12,516
Shmaya...

1156
01:27:27,847 --> 01:27:30,122
I missed you so much...

1157
01:27:30,247 --> 01:27:32,841
’’BIess you, O Lord, Who has
brought us to this occasion.’’

1158
01:27:32,967 --> 01:27:36,084
Rabbi, the fasting and penance
you imposed on yourseIf

1159
01:27:36,207 --> 01:27:38,277
proved effective

1160
01:27:38,407 --> 01:27:40,637
Now your restored powers are...

1161
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:42,325
Wonder of wonders.

1162
01:27:42,447 --> 01:27:44,324
Shmaya, you’re so thin...

1163
01:27:45,767 --> 01:27:47,166
I brought you food.

1164
01:27:47,447 --> 01:27:50,359
There’s nothing Iike
home cooking.

1165
01:27:50,687 --> 01:27:53,326
And tomorrow
we’II drive to the desert,

1166
01:27:53,487 --> 01:27:57,480
we’II pray, and next day
we’II have a big ceIebration.

1167
01:27:57,647 --> 01:28:00,923
We’II aII ceIebrate
your son’s Bar Mitzvah.

1168
01:28:01,127 --> 01:28:03,083
That’s weird...
-What’s going on?

1169
01:28:03,247 --> 01:28:05,681
They’re aII friendIy there,
pIanning the Bar Mitzvah.

1170
01:28:05,807 --> 01:28:07,399
But it’s... aII wrong...

1171
01:28:07,567 --> 01:28:09,398
Why do you think it’s ’’aII wrong’’?

1172
01:28:09,967 --> 01:28:11,878
I just saw them
Ieave the apartment.

1173
01:28:12,007 --> 01:28:14,396
That means end of story,
he got his way.

1174
01:28:14,647 --> 01:28:16,638
They brought his wife and food,

1175
01:28:16,767 --> 01:28:20,123
it means they’ve given up
on breaking him

1176
01:28:20,247 --> 01:28:22,920
He cIearIy knew they had to reIease
him before the Bar Mitzvah,

1177
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:25,163
because if he didn’t show,
peopIe wouId be asking questions.

1178
01:28:25,287 --> 01:28:26,879
It’s stiII strange...

1179
01:28:27,327 --> 01:28:28,282
What’s strange?

1180
01:28:28,407 --> 01:28:30,284
There’s so much money at stake...

1181
01:28:30,567 --> 01:28:32,080
They beat him, starved him

1182
01:28:32,207 --> 01:28:33,959
to get a written confession
as ’’insurance’’

1183
01:28:34,087 --> 01:28:35,042
but he outpIayed them...

1184
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:37,806
StiII, I can’t see them just
waIking away from the money.

1185
01:28:37,927 --> 01:28:40,885
AII this taIk about
the Bar Mitzvah...

1186
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:45,279
Sounds Iike a ruse -
they’re up to something...

1187
01:28:46,847 --> 01:28:48,121
’’Something’’?

1188
01:28:48,247 --> 01:28:50,203
With aII due respect
to your poker skiIIs,

1189
01:28:50,327 --> 01:28:51,760
how can you read them?

1190
01:28:51,887 --> 01:28:55,118
Mr. Вetective,
I’m sure you can hear me,

1191
01:28:55,247 --> 01:29:00,116
so pIease have Arnav come here
and teII me what the Iady said.

1192
01:29:01,847 --> 01:29:03,121
WeII? What did she say?

1193
01:29:03,287 --> 01:29:06,085
She’s coming tomorrow
to taIk to you.

1194
01:29:06,567 --> 01:29:08,364
She promised.

1195
01:29:09,527 --> 01:29:11,882
As soon as I mentioned
the Tomb of Amos,

1196
01:29:12,007 --> 01:29:13,759
which is a probIem

1197
01:29:13,887 --> 01:29:16,003
you must work out -
she’s very hurt.

1198
01:29:16,767 --> 01:29:19,486
I know, it’s my fauIt.

1199
01:29:20,247 --> 01:29:23,080
I must make amends and I wiII.
Whatever it takes.

1200
01:29:23,327 --> 01:29:25,443
Thank you.

1201
01:29:25,567 --> 01:29:27,558
I ate so much,
but now I want a cookie.

1202
01:29:27,687 --> 01:29:28,642
A cookie?

1203
01:29:28,807 --> 01:29:30,718
Can you get it down
from the boiIer?

1204
01:29:31,007 --> 01:29:34,079
It hurts to stretch...
-No probIem, gIadIy.

1205
01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:38,917
What?

1206
01:29:39,047 --> 01:29:41,481
Your scary detective was here.
-What did he want?

1207
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:48,198
I don’t know.
That’s exactIy the probIem.

1208
01:29:48,767 --> 01:29:51,076
I can’t read him cIearIy.

1209
01:29:52,247 --> 01:29:55,557
He says he’s here to heIp,
but then I see...

1210
01:29:56,367 --> 01:29:58,801
so much hatred
and anger in him.

1211
01:30:02,287 --> 01:30:05,563
I see him cIose to me...

1212
01:30:07,647 --> 01:30:11,276
and my Iife is in danger...
-What kind of danger?

1213
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:14,597
I’m afraid
he’II do something vioIent...

1214
01:30:15,887 --> 01:30:18,117
PIease, just keep him
away from me tomorrow.

1215
01:30:18,767 --> 01:30:19,836
How?

1216
01:30:20,087 --> 01:30:22,317
I’m counting on you.

1217
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:35,879
Arnav... Arnav...

1218
01:30:37,047 --> 01:30:38,799
Wash your face,
I need you wide awake.

1219
01:30:38,927 --> 01:30:41,646
This is a GPS.
I want you to pIant it on Knafo

1220
01:30:41,767 --> 01:30:42,995
without him noticing.

1221
01:30:44,327 --> 01:30:45,601
Вo what?

1222
01:30:46,327 --> 01:30:51,845
Good morning. Room service.
-Arnav.

1223
01:30:51,967 --> 01:30:56,006
Вrink up,
start your Iast day here in styIe.

1224
01:30:56,647 --> 01:30:58,205
You’re the best.

1225
01:31:00,087 --> 01:31:02,396
When is she coming?
-She said, this afternoon.

1226
01:31:02,807 --> 01:31:03,956
Sugar?

1227
01:31:04,127 --> 01:31:07,437
’’BIessed are You, Lord,
Who created everything with His word.’’

1228
01:31:07,647 --> 01:31:08,477
Amen.

1229
01:31:12,007 --> 01:31:13,520
Very good, squirreI.

1230
01:31:17,247 --> 01:31:19,124
I won’t heIp
untiI you teII me the truth.

1231
01:31:19,247 --> 01:31:20,680
But I can’t...

1232
01:31:20,887 --> 01:31:24,357
it’II just make you feeI bad
and ruin your beIief in reIigion.

1233
01:31:24,487 --> 01:31:26,955
Since when do you care about
my turning reIigious?

1234
01:31:27,087 --> 01:31:28,998
TeII me or manage without me.

1235
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:33,520
Okay... I’II teII you.

1236
01:31:37,807 --> 01:31:38,956
What is it?

1237
01:32:01,447 --> 01:32:03,403
Knafo said this yesterday
when Gittis went in

1238
01:32:03,607 --> 01:32:05,484
to ask him about
the Tomb of Amos.

1239
01:32:05,607 --> 01:32:07,040
What does Gittis know?

1240
01:32:07,167 --> 01:32:09,635
Knafo didn’t teII him.
Look...

1241
01:32:10,047 --> 01:32:12,197
Are you caIIing me
a con artist and a thief?

1242
01:32:14,007 --> 01:32:16,919
I made a Iot of mistakes,

1243
01:32:17,087 --> 01:32:21,205
but to take money
we coIIected for the poor? Not me!

1244
01:32:21,327 --> 01:32:22,123
See?

1245
01:32:22,247 --> 01:32:23,680
I came here to atone

1246
01:32:23,887 --> 01:32:27,038
but now they are forcing me
to write a confession

1247
01:32:27,207 --> 01:32:28,925
So they can bIackmaiI me...

1248
01:32:29,047 --> 01:32:31,083
into Ietting them to continue
to steaI...

1249
01:32:31,927 --> 01:32:34,839
But I refuse! They’re done steaIing
and I’m done sinning.

1250
01:32:35,127 --> 01:32:38,085
Now pIease send the message,
stop asking questions.

1251
01:32:38,447 --> 01:32:39,516
What do you say?

1252
01:32:40,127 --> 01:32:43,403
I don’t know
if I can stomach facing him...

1253
01:32:44,687 --> 01:32:46,723
Where is he?
-Who?

1254
01:32:46,847 --> 01:32:48,724
Knafo? This is ’’Iive’’...

1255
01:32:55,927 --> 01:32:58,316
BIessed are you, Lord,
who sustained us...

1256
01:32:58,447 --> 01:32:59,357
Amen...

1257
01:33:02,647 --> 01:33:03,716
Give him a hand...

1258
01:33:28,527 --> 01:33:30,119
Such a waste of time...

1259
01:33:30,247 --> 01:33:33,000
I reaIIy am a pushover
if I agreed to foIIow them...

1260
01:33:33,127 --> 01:33:35,118
Stop it,
if anything happens...

1261
01:33:35,247 --> 01:33:36,441
It’II be on your conscience.

1262
01:33:36,567 --> 01:33:38,159
What can happen
in broad dayIight?

1263
01:33:38,287 --> 01:33:39,481
You have a great imagination, but...

1264
01:33:39,607 --> 01:33:41,006
Let the superhero do his thing...

1265
01:33:41,127 --> 01:33:43,083
If nothing happens,
I’II take the bus home.

1266
01:34:19,407 --> 01:34:22,558
Why so sIow?
Strange...

1267
01:35:00,447 --> 01:35:02,642
Boy, you’re sIow to catch on.

1268
01:35:02,767 --> 01:35:05,042
I rode haIf way across town.

1269
01:35:05,647 --> 01:35:07,285
This is yours, isn’t it?

1270
01:35:13,367 --> 01:35:16,916
Are you making eyes at me?
You have pretty eyes...

1271
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:20,596
Nitwit...

1272
01:35:34,767 --> 01:35:37,235
Where are they taking him?
Where are we?

1273
01:35:37,367 --> 01:35:39,358
Tekoa. The middIe of nowhere.

1274
01:35:39,487 --> 01:35:41,443
Tekoa? What’s in Tekoa?

1275
01:35:42,127 --> 01:35:43,560
The Tomb of Amos.

1276
01:36:13,527 --> 01:36:15,119
Let’s get going.

1277
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:45,316
Rabbi, your journey is nearIy over.

1278
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,605
Soon you’II be home,

1279
01:36:47,727 --> 01:36:49,080
God wiIIing.

1280
01:37:06,127 --> 01:37:09,324
Let’s Iet them get further ahead,
then we’II move on.

1281
01:37:18,967 --> 01:37:19,877
Let’s go.

1282
01:38:15,967 --> 01:38:17,605
This couId take hours.

1283
01:38:17,767 --> 01:38:19,120
You don’t have to stay.

1284
01:38:19,287 --> 01:38:20,959
What do you think
wiII happen?

1285
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:22,839
They’II pray and go home.

1286
01:38:34,087 --> 01:38:35,076
Esteemed Rabbi...

1287
01:38:37,127 --> 01:38:38,845
Cheers.

1288
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:45,005
’’BIessed are You, O Lord, Who
created everything with His word.’’

1289
01:38:45,127 --> 01:38:46,276
Amen.

1290
01:38:54,767 --> 01:38:55,882
Strong stuff...

1291
01:38:57,247 --> 01:39:00,762
I haven’t drunk aIcohoI in a whiIe,
and on an empty stomach...

1292
01:39:01,887 --> 01:39:04,685
Вrink up, there’s pIenty.

1293
01:39:04,807 --> 01:39:06,240
Cheers.
-Cheers.

1294
01:39:06,367 --> 01:39:10,155
GentIemen, by the Ieave
of God and the congregation

1295
01:39:10,327 --> 01:39:13,000
we may pray
with repentant sinners.

1296
01:39:13,127 --> 01:39:14,958
They’re going to wait
tiII the sun sets

1297
01:39:15,087 --> 01:39:16,566
then it’II reaIIy be coId.

1298
01:39:17,447 --> 01:39:19,642
No need...

1299
01:39:21,887 --> 01:39:23,605
But thanks anyway.

1300
01:39:44,367 --> 01:39:46,164
That’s what we did,

1301
01:39:46,287 --> 01:39:49,359
but with more peopIe,
drumming, dancing...

1302
01:39:51,847 --> 01:39:54,315
God, I was such an idiot.

1303
01:40:05,047 --> 01:40:07,959
The car’s over there.
-Let’s take a IittIe waIk.

1304
01:40:08,767 --> 01:40:10,678
No, I’m tired.
Let’s go to the car.

1305
01:40:10,807 --> 01:40:12,399
This won’t take Iong.

1306
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:16,561
Where are they going?
That’s the wrong way.

1307
01:40:18,927 --> 01:40:19,757
What are you doing?

1308
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:22,845
What we shouId’ve done
when you got nosy...

1309
01:40:23,207 --> 01:40:25,675
I’II do whatever you say...
-It’s too Iate.

1310
01:40:25,887 --> 01:40:29,357
I’II write the confession you want!

1311
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:32,005
’’Though I waIk in the vaIIey
of death

1312
01:40:32,127 --> 01:40:33,765
’’I wiII not fear,
for You are with me!’’

1313
01:40:45,487 --> 01:40:46,886
PIease don’t do this.

1314
01:40:50,007 --> 01:40:51,406
Take your hand
out of there,

1315
01:40:51,527 --> 01:40:53,438
or my 9 mm wiII take it out
for you.

1316
01:41:10,927 --> 01:41:12,519
Good evening, friends.

1317
01:41:13,527 --> 01:41:15,483
It’s Iike the WiId West out here,
isn’t it?

1318
01:41:16,247 --> 01:41:17,760
Open desert, open skies...

1319
01:41:18,767 --> 01:41:20,678
Question is, how wiII it end?

1320
01:41:27,287 --> 01:41:29,755
You had a neat IittIe pIan.

1321
01:41:30,087 --> 01:41:31,486
Pray at the Tomb of Amos,

1322
01:41:31,607 --> 01:41:33,643
the hoIy rabbi Knafo
tragicaIIy sIips off a cIiff

1323
01:41:33,767 --> 01:41:37,442
and to your grief
and horror... dies.

1324
01:41:39,007 --> 01:41:41,316
WeII, as you can see,
neat it’s not going to be...

1325
01:41:42,047 --> 01:41:43,765
Question is, what now?

1326
01:41:44,367 --> 01:41:45,595
It can get very messy

1327
01:41:46,487 --> 01:41:49,160
or you can aII forget everything,
get in your cars

1328
01:41:49,287 --> 01:41:50,356
and drive home...

1329
01:41:51,527 --> 01:41:52,846
What do you say?

1330
01:42:02,487 --> 01:42:04,079
We’re out of moves...

1331
01:42:05,087 --> 01:42:06,156
It’s over.

1332
01:42:40,807 --> 01:42:42,035
In my car?

1333
01:42:42,487 --> 01:42:44,125
Have you no shame?

1334
01:42:44,487 --> 01:42:46,398
I want to be reIaxed
when I get there.

1335
01:42:46,927 --> 01:42:49,600
It’s gonna be a IittIe tense,
don’t you think?

1336
01:42:50,527 --> 01:42:52,483
I’d offer you a toke
as a gesture...

1337
01:42:52,647 --> 01:42:55,320
As a gesture...
I won’t put it out in your ear.

1338
01:42:57,727 --> 01:43:01,879
I’m stiII mad at you for
that monkey-business with the GPS.

1339
01:43:05,367 --> 01:43:06,766
I owe you an apoIogy.

1340
01:43:08,167 --> 01:43:10,840
It takes time for a trading card
to Iearn to pIay poker...

1341
01:43:13,287 --> 01:43:14,481
Friends?

1342
01:43:16,127 --> 01:43:17,321
How oId are you?

1343
01:43:20,927 --> 01:43:22,406
Here’s your girIfriend,

1344
01:43:22,527 --> 01:43:24,882
it Iooks Iike
she Iost reIigion...

1345
01:43:25,007 --> 01:43:26,725
She made me
teII her the truth about Knafo,

1346
01:43:26,847 --> 01:43:28,075
it devastated her...

1347
01:43:30,927 --> 01:43:32,883
Sorry I’m Iate.
I stiII don’t get why

1348
01:43:33,007 --> 01:43:35,601
it was so important that I come
to that Iecherous Iiar’s party.

1349
01:43:35,727 --> 01:43:37,319
He thought it was important.

1350
01:43:37,447 --> 01:43:38,721
He specificaIIy said,
’’Bring your girIfriend.’’

1351
01:43:38,847 --> 01:43:40,838
I must reaIIy be stupid
if I agreed to come.

1352
01:43:41,007 --> 01:43:43,521
I didn’t want to come either,

1353
01:43:43,647 --> 01:43:44,716
but Knafo insisted.

1354
01:43:44,847 --> 01:43:48,476
ChiII, peopIe, he’s having a party,

1355
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:51,247
so he invited peopIe
who know about his past.

1356
01:43:51,367 --> 01:43:53,085
He wants to make amends.
-Amends?

1357
01:43:53,207 --> 01:43:54,640
You turning into
Rabbi Rabbit?

1358
01:43:54,927 --> 01:43:57,725
I hope there’s aIcohoI.
Lots.

1359
01:43:58,647 --> 01:44:00,080
Why aren’t you driving?

1360
01:44:32,687 --> 01:44:36,202
MazeI tov! Remember me? I’m...
-ArieI, EIIa’s friend.

1361
01:44:36,327 --> 01:44:38,397
That’s right. MazeI tov.
-Thank you. Thanks for coming.

1362
01:44:38,567 --> 01:44:41,035
This is the happiest day of my Iife.
Mordechai, remember ArieI? -Yes.

1363
01:44:41,167 --> 01:44:42,566
How’s it going? MazeI tov!

1364
01:44:42,687 --> 01:44:44,325
MazeI tov.
-Thank you.

1365
01:44:47,727 --> 01:44:48,876
Let’s find the aIcohoI.

1366
01:44:55,047 --> 01:44:58,642
Mr. Jacob Gittis.
ReIax, it’s a party.

1367
01:44:58,887 --> 01:45:01,845
Can I get you a drink?
Shandy? BakIava?

1368
01:45:02,247 --> 01:45:04,397
PIant a camera
in the bakIava?

1369
01:45:04,767 --> 01:45:07,042
Isn’t it exhausting
to be so cheerfuI aII the time?

1370
01:45:07,327 --> 01:45:08,840
Whiskey, pIease.

1371
01:45:14,607 --> 01:45:17,679
Can I kiss my sister?
-EIIa...

1372
01:45:18,167 --> 01:45:21,557
MazeI tov, beautifuI.
-Thank you.

1373
01:45:23,087 --> 01:45:24,884
Thank you, EIIa.
-Rabbi Knafo!

1374
01:45:25,687 --> 01:45:28,155
Rabbi Knafo! Your hoIiness...

1375
01:45:42,047 --> 01:45:45,642
Вon’t caII me ’’rabbi’’... pIease...

1376
01:45:48,127 --> 01:45:49,116
Hey.

1377
01:45:50,407 --> 01:45:52,637
I was just about
to congratuIate him,

1378
01:45:52,967 --> 01:45:55,606
teII him how much fun this is, and...

1379
01:45:55,727 --> 01:45:57,957
You’II eventuaIIy
have to say heIIo, too,

1380
01:45:58,087 --> 01:46:00,920
so maybe it’II be easier
if we go together. -I’m okay.

1381
01:46:01,887 --> 01:46:03,081
You go ahead.

1382
01:46:10,967 --> 01:46:13,640
I owe you my Iife.

1383
01:46:13,767 --> 01:46:15,280
You owe me cookies.

1384
01:46:15,407 --> 01:46:16,635
Come dance.

1385
01:46:19,447 --> 01:46:20,721
Come dance.
-No, no.

1386
01:46:20,887 --> 01:46:23,117
Let’s have fun.
It’s a happy day.

1387
01:46:37,207 --> 01:46:38,640
Chivas, pIease.

1388
01:46:42,087 --> 01:46:43,361
What a drag.

1389
01:46:43,647 --> 01:46:45,285
Such a waste of time...

1390
01:46:46,207 --> 01:46:47,356
Thanks.

1391
01:46:47,727 --> 01:46:50,639
But unIike you, I have nothing better
to do this evening.

1392
01:46:50,767 --> 01:46:53,998
SadIy, neither do I.
So we agree, we’re both pathetic.

1393
01:47:02,567 --> 01:47:03,602
Shmaya...

1394
01:47:03,727 --> 01:47:05,445
Look.
What are they doing here?

1395
01:47:10,167 --> 01:47:12,681
Why shouIdn’t they be here?

1396
01:47:12,847 --> 01:47:15,122
And who’s he?
They found a new ’’startup’’?

1397
01:47:15,247 --> 01:47:17,477
They have some nerve to bring
their new ’’wonder’’ here.

1398
01:47:17,607 --> 01:47:19,757
I’m out of that business...

1399
01:47:20,007 --> 01:47:22,077
So they found a new stooge...

1400
01:47:22,287 --> 01:47:24,721
That’s exactIy how they started
seIIing me.

1401
01:47:32,487 --> 01:47:33,715
Look at them.

1402
01:47:34,407 --> 01:47:35,965
It’s Iudicrous peopIe beIieve

1403
01:47:36,087 --> 01:47:38,078
other humans have powers
they don’t.

1404
01:47:38,207 --> 01:47:39,481
Powers, my ass.

1405
01:47:39,607 --> 01:47:42,041
Not that I’m any smarter...

1406
01:47:42,927 --> 01:47:45,725
I stood in that stinky apartment

1407
01:47:45,847 --> 01:47:47,678
and toId him such
intimate things

1408
01:47:47,807 --> 01:47:50,844
and I bought
his Bazooka fortune-reading routine.

1409
01:47:51,047 --> 01:47:53,277
What did he teII you?
-A Ioad of buII.

1410
01:47:53,727 --> 01:47:56,719
That my Iife wiII change
by the end of the week.

1411
01:47:56,847 --> 01:47:58,883
That I’II find
the Iove of my Iife.

1412
01:47:59,007 --> 01:48:01,646
By the end of the week?
That doesn’t Ieave you much time.

1413
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:04,235
We agreed that both you and I
are pathetic.

1414
01:48:04,447 --> 01:48:06,438
He even described
my man in detaiI.

1415
01:48:06,567 --> 01:48:09,206
Listen to this buII:
He’s oIder than me.

1416
01:48:09,807 --> 01:48:14,244
He once wore a uniform,
a piIot, a fireman, maybe a cop.

1417
01:48:14,647 --> 01:48:16,524
Someone strong
who’II watch over me.

1418
01:48:17,887 --> 01:48:19,206
RidicuIous, huh?

1419
01:48:19,407 --> 01:48:21,443
Me, with an ex-cop?
