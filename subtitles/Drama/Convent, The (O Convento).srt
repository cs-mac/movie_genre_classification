This Film is based on ''La religieuse'' by
Denis Diderot

10
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,257
Where is the fruit, Ceso?

11
00:02:56,496 --> 00:02:58,361
Your Eminence will be here soon

12
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,463
I am sorry Sister Marta, it has happened
again

13
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:07,706
It was him.

14
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,882
Nonsense, I don't want to hear those
superstitions

15
00:03:17,216 --> 00:03:18,012
do you understand?

16
00:03:19,418 --> 00:03:20,146
Yes.

17
00:03:21,087 --> 00:03:23,385
Go now, they are coming.

18
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,065
My apologies, your Eminence

19
00:03:33,065 --> 00:03:37,024
we try not to let news from the outside
reach us.

20
00:03:38,738 --> 00:03:41,474
Mother Superior, these are noble words.

21
00:03:41,474 --> 00:03:44,375
I am aware what I ask is not easy.

22
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:46,708
The father of the countess Isabella

23
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,849
was a pious and righteous man

24
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:51,180
Just before passing away

25
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:56,347
he asked me to protect Isabella from her
uncle, Don Ascanio.

26
00:03:57,356 --> 00:03:59,688
I heard he is a heartless person.

27
00:04:00,626 --> 00:04:04,892
He is worse than that. He is vicious and
corrupt

28
00:04:05,064 --> 00:04:07,055
and unfortunately Isabella is very close
to him.

29
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,890
Your Eminence thinks her uncle

30
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:11,503
will try to influence her negatively?

31
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:17,074
I brought her here because I think we
can still save her soul.

32
00:04:18,277 --> 00:04:21,474
I am at your service, Your Eminence.

33
00:04:21,747 --> 00:04:25,148
I know goodness guides your actions.

34
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:30,652
Thank you Mother. Isabella is a proud
and lofty woman

35
00:04:30,723 --> 00:04:34,056
my hope is that she will decide to take
her vows

36
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,559
obviously with your help.

37
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:39,561
Against her will? With no authentic
call?

38
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,700
This would offend God, Your Eminence.

39
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:44,861
Not necessarily, Sister Angela.

40
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:50,573
This will protect her from Don Ascanio's
attempts to abduct her.

41
00:04:52,011 --> 00:04:59,144
When things calm down, we would
release her from her vows

42
00:05:00,353 --> 00:05:01,217
if she wishes.

43
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:05,456
My obedience is to the church of God,
Your Eminence

44
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:09,925
but you are asking me to obey the
church of the world.

45
00:05:11,397 --> 00:05:15,265
Unfortunately in my position I am
required to deal with this.

46
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:21,296
I have no doubts the peacefulness of
this place

47
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:23,768
will work the miracle.

48
00:05:25,344 --> 00:05:28,336
Now I have to rush to Milan.

49
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:30,576
As you wish, Your Eminence

50
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:33,915
please tell your coachman to avoid the
forest

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,618
it is dangerous to travel across,
especially at night.

52
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:46,291
Welcome to Santa Fiora, My name is
Sister Giulia

53
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:47,525
and she is Sister Consolata.

54
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,028
And I am Isabella, countess of Lignate.

55
00:05:52,872 --> 00:05:54,601
What do you want? Are you my
servants?

56
00:05:55,074 --> 00:05:58,407
No, we are to help you as sisters.

57
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:01,612
The Mother Superior wants you to wear
this.

58
00:06:02,515 --> 00:06:05,348
Do you really think I will wear this?

59
00:06:07,053 --> 00:06:08,452
It is not good for my skin.

60
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:14,851
Two underskirts, four shirts and

61
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:19,427
two pairs of socks and 1, 2, 3 ...

62
00:06:23,536 --> 00:06:27,131
Mother, Isabella is here

63
00:06:30,443 --> 00:06:34,038
Sister Giulia, Sister Veronica you may
leave now.

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,853
Welcome to Santa Fiora, Isabella. In this
peaceful place ...

65
00:06:47,827 --> 00:06:50,591
Cover up, I said cover up.

66
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:04,042
I won't judge your insolence, daughter

67
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:08,711
it is my duty to forgive and to
understand.

68
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:20,551
You are here to find peace in the
serenity of this convent

69
00:07:21,293 --> 00:07:23,523
Is this the reason you are keeping me
prisoner?

70
00:07:25,631 --> 00:07:27,360
You are here because of your father's
will

71
00:07:27,466 --> 00:07:28,728
and the church recommendation

72
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:32,631
aren't those good reasons for
obedience?

73
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,229
Why don't you admit that I am here

74
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,604
because of Cardinal Dell'Aio's plot.

75
00:07:38,978 --> 00:07:42,277
Daughter, how dare you to speak like
that of a pious person?

76
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:43,942
I warn you Mother.

77
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,874
My uncle will not tolerate such an abuse

78
00:07:47,353 --> 00:07:49,344
and he will do everything to take me
away from here.

79
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,786
I will not ask you to take the vows,
Isabella

80
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:56,324
becoming a nun is a struggle against
nature

81
00:07:57,563 --> 00:08:01,556
The sacrifices are inhumane and are
worthy

82
00:08:02,668 --> 00:08:10,575
only if done with humility, love and
charity of the heart.

83
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:14,740
This is something you cannot possibly
achieve.

84
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,608
It would mean to sacrifice your pride.

85
00:08:20,019 --> 00:08:21,486
What do you know about love

86
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:22,678
about the kisses of a man that loves
you

87
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:24,652
of the arms of a man that hold you?

88
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:28,888
I have tried all these and I will not forget
them.

89
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,423
And how would I forget?

90
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:31,996
With your useless prayers?

91
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:36,895
Daughter, you are cursing, I am not
going to listen to you

92
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:39,999
go back to your cell, that's an order.

93
00:15:48,767 --> 00:15:49,893
Ascanio.

94
00:19:31,923 --> 00:19:34,949
Sister Marta, please forgive me

95
00:19:36,194 --> 00:19:39,686
I cannot forgive your lust, come with me

96
00:20:10,395 --> 00:20:11,828
What you have done is terrible.

97
00:20:17,302 --> 00:20:20,169
I repent, I repent with all my soul,
forgive me.

98
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:26,205
Oh no.

99
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:54,578
Calm down, sisters. Please don't panic.

100
00:24:54,913 --> 00:24:56,471
It is nothing, stay calm. Stay calm

101
00:24:59,017 --> 00:25:01,451
I am sure there is nothing to worry
about.

102
00:25:01,953 --> 00:25:02,817
Calm down sisters, please.

103
00:25:03,054 --> 00:25:03,611
Where is Sister Marta?

104
00:25:03,755 --> 00:25:04,847
In her cell.

105
00:25:04,956 --> 00:25:06,321
Let's call her, Sister Veronica.

106
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:08,051
Yes.

107
00:25:13,064 --> 00:25:16,966
I am ashamed, Lord, but I did not intend
to do that

108
00:25:17,168 --> 00:25:19,568
something that I can't explain happened
inside me.

109
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:23,065
Something I couldn't resist, please
forgive me.

110
00:25:34,219 --> 00:25:34,844
Sister Marta, where were you?

111
00:25:34,986 --> 00:25:37,147
In the chapel, what's happening?

112
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:39,450
I don't know, something serious has
happened.

113
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:06,211
Oh lord! Is he dead?

114
00:26:06,518 --> 00:26:07,280
I don't know.

115
00:26:12,757 --> 00:26:15,191
He is breathing, go back with the
others.

116
00:26:21,232 --> 00:26:22,096
Careful.

117
00:26:28,172 --> 00:26:29,605
Sister, are we in danger?

118
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:31,469
No, don't worry.

119
00:26:31,643 --> 00:26:34,237
Blessed Virgin, thank you. What was
that noise?

120
00:26:34,379 --> 00:26:35,676
There is a young man injured in the
garden

121
00:26:35,813 --> 00:26:37,212
Sister Angela is taking care of him.

122
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:33,837
Mother, our Rule forbids us to host a
man under our roof.

123
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,370
I know, Sister Marta.

124
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,030
But we also have the duty of charity

125
00:27:37,241 --> 00:27:39,266
and we are bound to respect the right of
asylum.

126
00:27:39,477 --> 00:27:41,968
The convent is too far from a village

127
00:27:42,313 --> 00:27:44,941
who else would rescue that poor man?

128
00:27:46,684 --> 00:27:49,016
You are right, Mother. Isn't it strange
what has happened?

129
00:27:49,153 --> 00:27:50,780
Oh no, unfortunately it is not the first
time

130
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:53,253
brigands assault those who travel
across the forest.

131
00:27:54,192 --> 00:27:56,922
Still, I don't understand what brought
the young man this far

132
00:27:57,362 --> 00:27:59,626
there is only our convent in these hills.

133
00:27:59,831 --> 00:28:02,095
Maybe he was lost, who knows?

134
00:28:03,101 --> 00:28:06,901
Go now, and do as I ordered.

135
00:28:16,314 --> 00:28:18,248
Mother, you asked for me?

136
00:28:19,517 --> 00:28:25,149
Yes, Sister Veronica, ask Ceso to come
and see me.

137
00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:28,181
Also, we have to bring some food to
that man

138
00:28:30,061 --> 00:28:32,461
I want you to do that.

139
00:28:32,997 --> 00:28:34,021
At your service, Mother.

140
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:36,923
I am old enough not to be led into
temptation.

141
00:28:37,168 --> 00:28:41,298
Sister Veronica, I will not tolerate such
language.

142
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:43,400
I am sorry Mother.

143
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:02,623
They say he is very handsome and
gentle

144
00:29:02,894 --> 00:29:05,124
and that he fought against the brigands
like a lion

145
00:29:05,963 --> 00:29:07,328
maybe the brigands are still around.

146
00:29:08,232 --> 00:29:09,324
Why do you want to scare me?

147
00:29:09,467 --> 00:29:10,661
No, I want you to be ready.

148
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:13,597
What would you do if those sons of
Satan appeared here?

149
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:16,232
I would be dead scared, what else?

150
00:29:16,607 --> 00:29:18,734
No, I meant, what if they would rape
you?

151
00:29:19,277 --> 00:29:20,369
I'd rather die.

152
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:22,511
I'd rather be a martyr.

153
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,611
Oh Virgin Mary, what are you saying?

154
00:29:34,158 --> 00:29:35,250
Take it.

155
00:29:35,993 --> 00:29:36,482
Thanks.

156
00:29:37,128 --> 00:29:38,891
Do you want some, Sister Marta?

157
00:29:39,097 --> 00:29:41,622
It's so kind of you to bring this to me.

158
00:29:42,266 --> 00:29:43,062
No thank you.

159
00:29:43,668 --> 00:29:46,569
I told you that I have learned to repress
all pleasures of the flesh.

160
00:29:47,338 --> 00:29:50,364
I know, you even refused a necklace

161
00:29:50,475 --> 00:29:54,070
that would be envied by any woman, sit
here next to me.

162
00:29:56,514 --> 00:29:58,709
Your friendship is the best present for
me.

163
00:30:00,985 --> 00:30:02,452
You deserve more, Sister Marta.

164
00:30:03,554 --> 00:30:05,112
When I get out of here and you'll see.

165
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:08,491
I'll convince the cardinal that this
convent

166
00:30:08,693 --> 00:30:11,355
would have no better Superior than you.

167
00:30:11,896 --> 00:30:14,387
Do you want me to commit the sin of
pride?

168
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:19,392
Oh no, I just want to be your friend.

169
00:30:23,107 --> 00:30:24,369
You have to get rid of that

170
00:30:24,709 --> 00:30:28,406
the Rule forbids us to keep profane
images in our cell.

171
00:30:31,182 --> 00:30:32,479
There is nothing wrong with it.

172
00:30:33,551 --> 00:30:36,418
He is Don Ascanio, my dear uncle

173
00:30:36,888 --> 00:30:39,823
He can not help if he doesn't know that I
am here.

174
00:30:40,158 --> 00:30:41,022
I was thinking of that young man

175
00:30:41,392 --> 00:30:42,723
tell me what do you know about him?

176
00:30:43,261 --> 00:30:45,422
Only what I've said. His name is Guido
Bencio

177
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:47,291
he is an artist or something like that.

178
00:30:49,801 --> 00:30:52,235
Sister Marta, please do your best so I
can meet him

179
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,098
speak to him.

180
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:55,399
No, that's impossible.

181
00:30:55,506 --> 00:30:56,768
I would do everything for you

182
00:30:56,908 --> 00:30:58,500
but Mother Superior gave strict orders

183
00:30:59,010 --> 00:30:59,669
I am sorry.

184
00:30:59,811 --> 00:31:02,041
In this case, let's make something up,
an excuse

185
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,477
I absolutely have to speak to him.

186
00:31:10,054 --> 00:31:11,885
Magnificent, celestial

187
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:14,185
they should canonize you for the way
you cook.

188
00:31:14,425 --> 00:31:16,222
Shut up! You are not an atheist, are
you?

189
00:31:17,862 --> 00:31:18,658
Quite the opposite

190
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,464
I would be more devoted than you

191
00:31:21,699 --> 00:31:22,825
but I am scared of the idea of paradise

192
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,331
it is probably an extremely boring
place.

193
00:31:24,902 --> 00:31:26,028
Oh Jesus

194
00:31:30,508 --> 00:31:31,770
I can always change my mind.

195
00:31:33,644 --> 00:31:35,635
Maybe it is not by chance that I ended
up here

196
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,874
you could treat my soul as you treat my
body.

197
00:31:39,183 --> 00:31:40,411
No doubt, Sir.

198
00:31:40,651 --> 00:31:43,814
There is only one problem; I would have
to stay close to you

199
00:31:44,388 --> 00:31:46,618
if only I could get a room in the
convent.

200
00:31:47,558 --> 00:31:49,185
This is impossible, that's the Rule.

201
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,757
Maybe I can convince the Mother
Superior, who knows?

202
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:53,326
She is an extraordinary woman

203
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,397
and she is inflexible with her principles.

204
00:31:55,766 --> 00:31:56,755
You can say that.

205
00:31:58,736 --> 00:32:01,864
She hasn't come to see me, tell her I
want to speak to her.

206
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:05,065
Believe me Isabella, this is not the right
thing.

207
00:32:05,343 --> 00:32:08,039
Isabella, don't at impulsively.

208
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:11,042
By pretending to follow the Mother
Superior

209
00:32:11,249 --> 00:32:13,774
you would get what you want.

210
00:32:15,119 --> 00:32:16,177
You speak better than a woman of the
world

211
00:32:16,254 --> 00:32:17,585
considering that you are a nun.

212
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:23,353
Careful Isabella, do not forget what I
wear.

213
00:32:24,028 --> 00:32:26,462
Sorry Sister Marta, believe me

214
00:32:26,998 --> 00:32:28,590
if I stay here any longer I will go crazy.

215
00:32:28,733 --> 00:32:30,291
All right. I will help you.

216
00:32:30,635 --> 00:32:32,865
But what tells you we can trust that
man.

217
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:35,302
You said that he is a gentleman.

218
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,106
This is what I think, but looks can be
deceiving.

219
00:32:41,045 --> 00:32:43,275
We are not going to have another
opportunity like this.

220
00:32:43,447 --> 00:32:44,539
Please, let me speak to him.

221
00:32:45,883 --> 00:32:49,284
No Isabella, I won't leave you alone with
that man

222
00:32:50,087 --> 00:32:51,850
I will speak to him, I promise

223
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,357
but I have to wait for the right moment

224
00:32:54,992 --> 00:32:55,481
if Mother Superior finds out

225
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:59,427
we will be in trouble. Isabella, I am
doing this only for you.

226
00:33:27,124 --> 00:33:28,455
You asked to speak to me, Sir.

227
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:30,854
I wanted to see you again.

228
00:33:33,931 --> 00:33:35,626
Speak, I don't have much time.

229
00:33:36,434 --> 00:33:39,403
I am dying. No, not because of my
injury.

230
00:33:40,404 --> 00:33:45,364
Your hands worked a miracle. I am
dying of loneliness.

231
00:33:46,844 --> 00:33:48,436
Sister Veronica told me of your request

232
00:33:50,281 --> 00:33:51,805
what you ask is impossible.

233
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:57,086
Impossible is a cruel word and you are
not cruel, I am sure.

234
00:33:58,389 --> 00:34:00,619
Do you know why I asked for a room in
the convent?

235
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:07,261
We will do our best to treat you here as
well.

236
00:34:08,165 --> 00:34:10,633
It is not that, it is to be next to you.

237
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:15,002
Sir, I will not tolerate your language any
further.

238
00:34:15,973 --> 00:34:19,431
No, please, do not get me wrong,
danger lurks out there

239
00:34:20,745 --> 00:34:24,442
and I am the only one who can protect
the convent.

240
00:34:26,217 --> 00:34:28,344
Our fate is in God's will.

241
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,815
There is no wealth here to attract
criminals

242
00:34:33,424 --> 00:34:37,383
other than a few silver candlesticks in
the chapel.

243
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:42,557
You have more than that, Mother. Your
virtues, for example.

244
00:34:44,268 --> 00:34:45,166
What do you mean?

245
00:34:46,037 --> 00:34:49,029
I mean, I am a man, and you, under the
vest, you are a woman.

246
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,263
Sir

247
00:34:50,374 --> 00:34:54,401
No, be honest, why did you asked the
gardener to leave?

248
00:34:54,612 --> 00:34:55,909
You wanted us to remain alone?

249
00:34:56,047 --> 00:34:57,071
How dare you?

250
00:34:58,849 --> 00:34:59,315
Mother

251
00:35:00,951 --> 00:35:01,940
Are you Ok?

252
00:35:03,854 --> 00:35:06,482
Please don't leave me, I need you ...

253
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:09,319
I need to feel your body

254
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:15,556
Leave me, please

255
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:20,995
No, do not resist

256
00:35:21,105 --> 00:35:24,871
I need to feel your body against mine.

257
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:28,812
Leave me

258
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,643
Do not say what you are not feeling in
your heart.

259
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:34,910
Calm down, I won't hurt you.

260
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,050
Mother, Sister Marta.

261
00:35:37,288 --> 00:35:37,947
Help me.

262
00:35:38,222 --> 00:35:39,655
Leave her, are you crazy, come Mother

263
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,525
let's get out of here.

264
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,338
Sister Marta, is that you?

265
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:12,817
Isabella!

266
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,723
I understand your surprise.

267
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:16,725
I know whom you were waiting for.

268
00:36:17,795 --> 00:36:19,319
I bet the Superior doesn't imagine

269
00:36:19,497 --> 00:36:21,431
what is happening in this bed

270
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:22,591
is that right Sister Lacinia?

271
00:36:23,667 --> 00:36:26,261
Think what would happen if she found
out?

272
00:36:27,972 --> 00:36:30,839
No, please, please, don't tell her

273
00:36:31,175 --> 00:36:32,403
I won't do it again, I swear

274
00:36:33,777 --> 00:36:37,804
What do I are of your repentance? I will
not say anything.

275
00:36:38,516 --> 00:36:40,916
Thank you, you have my eternal
gratitude.

276
00:36:42,019 --> 00:36:44,544
Sister Lacinia, you have to prove me it
to me.

277
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:47,423
Anything, ask me anything.

278
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:50,953
I want you to bring a message to that
man.

279
00:36:51,395 --> 00:36:52,327
That's impossible.

280
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:56,091
It is impossible for me but not for you,
they keep an eye on me.

281
00:36:57,434 --> 00:37:00,494
I was hoping that Sister Marta would
help me, but she won't.

282
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:07,903
So you'll do it. You have to, otherwise I
will speak.

283
00:38:05,202 --> 00:38:05,998
Sister Lacinia.

284
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:09,972
Sister Marta, I don't ...

285
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:13,504
No, don't say anything, I know why you
are here

286
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:16,611
does it still hurt?

287
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,081
Yes, it is all burning.

288
00:38:20,818 --> 00:38:24,777
A purifying burn, Sister that will keep
hellfire away.

289
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:55,111
Thank you Sister Marta

290
00:38:56,086 --> 00:38:58,850
when you touch me the pain vanishes.

291
00:39:01,792 --> 00:39:03,054
That's because I love you, sister.

292
00:39:03,827 --> 00:39:05,488
Because you are the sweetest

293
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,931
and I want to rescue you from desire
and sin.

294
00:44:22,045 --> 00:44:26,209
Sister Consolata, wake up, the devil is
here, in the convent.

295
00:45:08,492 --> 00:45:09,754
Mother, hurry up.

296
00:45:13,497 --> 00:45:15,590
Sister Veronica, what's happened?
Speak.

297
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:19,033
Sacrilegious, Mother, in the church,
hurry up.

298
00:45:22,706 --> 00:45:24,003
What's happened?

299
00:46:12,856 --> 00:46:16,724
Hurry up, look, over there, by the altar,
look.

300
00:46:19,129 --> 00:46:25,967
No, no, look here he is again, look.

301
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:34,670
Lord help us.

302
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:40,783
Oh God.

303
00:46:44,187 --> 00:46:45,415
Lord.

304
00:47:24,594 --> 00:47:25,652
Sister Marta, is terrible,

305
00:47:26,496 --> 00:47:29,863
we are all victims of a nightmare or God
has abandoned us.

306
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,258
That was not a hallucination, Mother. .

307
00:47:32,803 --> 00:47:35,966
We have all seen those Sacrilegious
images

308
00:47:41,144 --> 00:47:43,009
I have to face the facts, Sister Marta.

309
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:45,411
I don't know what we did wrong

310
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:49,642
but we have to get rid of this curse.

311
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:52,846
What you want to do, Mother?

312
00:47:53,557 --> 00:47:56,025
I will call Padre Arnaldo, the exorcist.

313
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:00,186
Please go to the Abbey and ask for him.

314
00:48:01,731 --> 00:48:03,028
With his help, God willing

315
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,468
we will restore calm and serenity in the
convent.

316
00:48:07,671 --> 00:48:10,162
I will speak to the cardinal

317
00:48:11,141 --> 00:48:13,302
I will give back the authority he gave
me

318
00:48:14,311 --> 00:48:19,408
and I will refer you, Sister Marta, as
worthy to succeed in this ...

319
00:48:20,383 --> 00:48:22,146
What are you saying, Mother? I am not
worthy.

320
00:48:23,987 --> 00:48:27,184
Please, obey, you will leave at dawn.

321
00:48:28,258 --> 00:48:30,055
But be careful, Sister Marta

322
00:48:31,228 --> 00:48:33,526
I would not forgive myself if something
were to happen to you.

323
00:48:34,297 --> 00:48:35,264
Thank you Mother.

324
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:38,534
I will walk through the hills to avoid any
nasty experience.

325
00:48:39,502 --> 00:48:42,335
You can leave, Sister Marta. I am going
to pray.

326
00:48:57,587 --> 00:48:59,782
Countess Isabella is waiting for you.
Here.

327
00:48:59,856 --> 00:49:01,289
Tell her I will be there in one hour.

328
00:49:01,625 --> 00:49:03,388
I will wait for everyone to be asleep.

329
00:49:04,461 --> 00:49:07,658
Remember, second aisle, first door to
the left.

330
00:49:07,797 --> 00:49:10,459
First door, thank you sister. One
moment

331
00:49:11,668 --> 00:49:14,330
You see? It looks like the unknown god
is spying on us.

332
00:49:14,671 --> 00:49:16,161
Do you also know the legend?

333
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:19,706
The convent was built on top of pagan
temple ruins

334
00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:21,739
and this angered him

335
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:23,876
and lots of things have happened over
the centuries:

336
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:26,577
fires, pestilences, plunder.

337
00:49:27,517 --> 00:49:32,648
I am an artist, I make sculptures and I
came over here to see him.

338
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:35,290
I had heard it was a masterpiece

339
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:38,655
but it is more than that. It seems alive,
cruel

340
00:49:38,929 --> 00:49:43,389
with a terrifying strength. Look at its icy
eyes.

341
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:45,299
Leave me please.

342
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:47,167
Can it be the devil?

343
00:49:53,877 --> 00:49:56,209
You gave an idea, my old friend, the
devil.

344
00:49:56,613 --> 00:49:58,979
They will be so scared nobody will try to
stop me.

345
00:50:23,506 --> 00:50:23,972
Yes.

346
00:50:29,479 --> 00:50:30,844
So, how did it go, tell me.

347
00:50:31,147 --> 00:50:31,977
He will come in one hour.

348
00:50:32,315 --> 00:50:32,804
How is he?

349
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:34,041
He is handsome like an angel.

350
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:36,015
No, it is not what I asked.

351
00:50:36,553 --> 00:50:37,542
Did you tell him what I want from him?

352
00:50:38,021 --> 00:50:39,818
Yes, of course and he will help.

353
00:50:40,123 --> 00:50:43,388
Was he honest? I mean, is he really a
gentleman?

354
00:50:43,927 --> 00:50:47,226
How stupid, how can you tell if he is a
gentleman or not?

355
00:50:47,497 --> 00:50:48,122
There was something, though ...

356
00:50:48,898 --> 00:50:49,762
What? Tell me.

357
00:50:51,434 --> 00:50:52,560
The way he looks at you

358
00:50:53,003 --> 00:50:54,231
there is an evil gleam in his eyes, false

359
00:50:54,838 --> 00:50:58,535
it scares you, like the eyes of the
unknown god.

360
00:51:01,511 --> 00:51:04,742
If he does not help, it will be the end for
me.

361
00:51:20,296 --> 00:51:21,160
Please, no, no.

362
00:51:21,531 --> 00:51:22,862
Don't be stupid.

363
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:35,367
For me? Oh, it is wonderful but I can't.

364
00:51:37,447 --> 00:51:40,245
Why? I want to prove to you

365
00:51:41,751 --> 00:51:43,343
that I am your friend and I am not as
proud as you think.

366
00:51:45,688 --> 00:51:47,986
Thank you, I have never seen
something so beautiful

367
00:51:48,191 --> 00:51:49,123
but I cannot accept

368
00:51:49,459 --> 00:51:52,553
the Rule forbids us to own anything, it
would be a sin.

369
00:51:54,831 --> 00:51:56,696
It would be if you were already a nun

370
00:51:57,434 --> 00:51:59,061
but you are not, like me.

371
00:51:59,836 --> 00:52:02,703
When I get out of here, you will come
with me. Think Giulia.

372
00:52:03,606 --> 00:52:07,098
In my palace, as my lady and my friend.

373
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:09,538
You would have beautiful dresses

374
00:52:09,646 --> 00:52:12,137
jewelry like this one. Men will court you.

375
00:52:12,515 --> 00:52:13,209
No, please.

376
00:52:14,317 --> 00:52:17,252
Do not lie, I know that you want it.

377
00:52:17,487 --> 00:52:22,049
Listen to me, you will do something for
me, for both of us.

378
00:53:51,214 --> 00:53:54,012
At your service countess. Or sister if
you prefer.

379
00:53:56,953 --> 00:53:59,922
My name is Guido Bencio, but you
should know that

380
00:54:00,056 --> 00:54:01,853
since you asked for my help.

381
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:06,721
It seems like they are holding you
prisoner. You don't talk?

382
00:54:08,064 --> 00:54:09,122
I understand, you don't trust me.

383
00:54:10,099 --> 00:54:14,365
It is normal, you don't know me, but I
myself have to trust you.

384
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,703
It is a great risk, a kidnapping and a
sacrilege

385
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:18,772
means ending up on the gallows...

386
00:54:19,042 --> 00:54:20,407
and I do are about my neck,

387
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:22,473
unless the stakes are worth the risk.

388
00:54:30,587 --> 00:54:34,921
Let me see. Is this my price?

389
00:54:36,593 --> 00:54:38,788
I have to admit it is a beautiful piece of
jewelry

390
00:54:40,163 --> 00:54:40,993
but it is not enough.

391
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:45,461
There is another gem that could
convince me to take a risk:

392
00:54:45,602 --> 00:54:46,330
your beauty.

393
00:54:48,304 --> 00:54:49,737
You have to give if you want to receive

394
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,269
and you have a lot to offer.

395
00:54:54,043 --> 00:54:54,634
You can't.

396
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:59,008
Finally I hear your voice. They told me
you were a tiger

397
00:54:59,282 --> 00:55:00,647
but you tremble like a lamb.

398
00:55:03,419 --> 00:55:04,249
No please.

399
00:58:46,843 --> 00:58:51,803
Free us from temptation,
deliver us from evil.

400
00:58:57,320 --> 00:58:57,979
Let's go.

401
00:59:07,864 --> 00:59:08,888
I am Isabella di Lignate.

402
00:59:09,866 --> 00:59:10,230
You?

403
00:59:12,535 --> 00:59:14,560
Yes, and I am not the whore you think I
am

404
00:59:14,837 --> 00:59:16,862
ready to rub myself against the first
man.

405
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:20,537
That's too bad, although I doubt this is
true.

406
00:59:23,246 --> 00:59:24,645
And now that we have introduced
ourselves

407
00:59:24,747 --> 00:59:27,045
could you explain what this game is
about?

408
00:59:27,183 --> 00:59:29,208
I wanted to be sure that I could trust
you.

409
00:59:29,519 --> 00:59:30,451
So?

410
00:59:30,786 --> 00:59:32,515
You are a dirty, insolent man.

411
00:59:32,922 --> 00:59:35,482
More, I am a sinner and a heartless
man.

412
00:59:36,058 --> 00:59:37,184
Are you on sale?

413
00:59:37,493 --> 00:59:39,290
Yes, it is only a matter of price.

414
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:40,929
Someone is coming.

415
00:59:41,931 --> 00:59:42,522
Hurry up.

416
00:59:46,736 --> 00:59:47,828
You know where to look for me.

417
01:00:09,559 --> 01:00:12,494
The devil, Lord save us.

418
01:01:10,786 --> 01:01:11,775
Go back to your cell

419
01:01:11,954 --> 01:01:14,252
not a word about what's happened or
you will regret it.

420
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:16,290
The same for you.

421
01:01:47,757 --> 01:01:51,625
Jesus, why do I have to see such things
at my old age.

422
01:01:52,328 --> 01:01:56,025
How can you not believe in the
unknown god's curse.

423
01:01:56,499 --> 01:01:59,400
Shut up, Sister Veronica. You are
cursing?

424
01:02:00,236 --> 01:02:01,498
Hurry up, Sister Marta

425
01:02:02,104 --> 01:02:05,073
I hope that pious man will purge the
devil out.

426
01:02:05,307 --> 01:02:06,296
Praise the Lord.

427
01:02:06,709 --> 01:02:07,539
Amen.

428
01:03:04,233 --> 01:03:06,292
What is that nun doing in the forest?

429
01:03:06,402 --> 01:03:07,027
I don't' know.

430
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:09,001
Is she taking a walk?

431
01:03:10,206 --> 01:03:11,002
What is she doing then?

432
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,702
Maybe she is going to the village.

433
01:03:18,814 --> 01:03:19,405
What should we do?

434
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,378
Maybe the man that ran away told them
about us

435
01:03:23,619 --> 01:03:25,746
and she is bringing the money to the
village.

436
01:03:53,282 --> 01:03:56,342
Don't move sister, don't scream or I'll
kill you.

437
01:04:01,757 --> 01:04:02,587
Is she dead?

438
01:04:02,925 --> 01:04:06,361
No, let's move her out of the path and
search her.

439
01:04:09,999 --> 01:04:11,091
She is heavy.

440
01:04:11,467 --> 01:04:14,925
Of course, nuns eat every day, not like
us.

441
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:16,896
They eat well.

442
01:04:28,717 --> 01:04:34,246
Here is fine, let's see what she has.

443
01:04:51,006 --> 01:04:54,703
There is nothing here, no money.

444
01:04:55,544 --> 01:04:56,511
Nice tits.

445
01:04:57,012 --> 01:04:58,104
Let's see what she has in here

446
01:05:00,683 --> 01:05:02,048
she is like any other woman

447
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,587
not bad.

448
01:05:09,291 --> 01:05:10,223
Look at her legs

449
01:05:10,526 --> 01:05:11,754
Tell me, have you ever screwed a nun?

450
01:05:12,628 --> 01:05:16,257
When I was with the Squinter we
screwed the whole convent.

451
01:05:23,739 --> 01:05:24,763
Let's look how she is down there.

452
01:05:35,117 --> 01:05:36,175
She is a virgin.

453
01:05:36,352 --> 01:05:36,943
Really?

454
01:05:37,686 --> 01:05:40,587
She is a virgin, a virgin.

455
01:05:43,459 --> 01:05:45,086
She must be a recent nun.

456
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:47,655
We really have to fuck her, or it will be
bad for our reputation.

457
01:05:47,796 --> 01:05:48,091
You are right.

458
01:05:48,564 --> 01:05:54,230
You fucked the whole convent so I go
first...

459
01:06:12,454 --> 01:06:13,443
Leave me.

460
01:06:18,627 --> 01:06:19,457
Stop.

461
01:06:25,734 --> 01:06:27,065
Stop or it will hurt.

462
01:06:39,949 --> 01:06:41,678
Be quiet, hold her.

463
01:06:51,226 --> 01:06:52,193
Hold her, let me do it.

464
01:06:58,133 --> 01:06:59,794
Be quiet, don't scream.

465
01:07:07,343 --> 01:07:09,004
Be quiet, here, take this.

466
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:28,923
Be quiet, we are not killing you,

467
01:07:29,565 --> 01:07:30,623
take this

468
01:08:03,699 --> 01:08:05,098
a bit more, like that

469
01:08:33,996 --> 01:08:35,190
Come here.

470
01:08:35,464 --> 01:08:36,260
Leave me, leave me.

471
01:08:36,799 --> 01:08:37,697
Don't let her go, follow her.

472
01:08:39,802 --> 01:08:40,234
I can't.

473
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:42,428
Let her go, she is going crazy.

474
01:08:42,738 --> 01:08:44,603
Follow her, go.

475
01:11:25,801 --> 01:11:29,032
Sister, you are saying that those
infernal apparitions

476
01:11:29,538 --> 01:11:32,302
started with the arrival of the young
lady.

477
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:37,702
Yes, maybe they were called up by her
tormented soul.

478
01:11:39,214 --> 01:11:41,512
If she was already
holding a sin in her heart

479
01:11:41,717 --> 01:11:45,983
it was your duty to punish her
immediately.

480
01:11:47,189 --> 01:11:51,250
Unfortunately, father, it is hard to realize

481
01:11:52,027 --> 01:11:56,020
how weak charity and piety can be
sometimes.

482
01:11:58,367 --> 01:12:03,862
That's why Satan wins.

483
01:12:08,377 --> 01:12:12,973
We have to be strong in front of sin.

484
01:12:17,886 --> 01:12:20,286
I am the only one to blame for all this.

485
01:12:21,323 --> 01:12:22,620
Do you think this is enough?

486
01:12:22,891 --> 01:12:24,688
Mother Superior, your faith is a wall of
pride

487
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:27,694
You, with your foolish actions

488
01:12:27,863 --> 01:12:31,924
you have allowed lust and sin to enter
this house of God

489
01:12:32,734 --> 01:12:35,294
There is no doubt the devil is here in the
convent.

490
01:12:36,972 --> 01:12:39,202
Even if there was any doubt

491
01:12:40,142 --> 01:12:46,479
did you ask yourself why I was already
on my way to the convent?

492
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:56,280
That's true, Sister Marta never reached
the village to call you.

493
01:12:56,858 --> 01:13:04,094
I had a feeling, it was the devil
challenging me, but I will win.

494
01:13:08,937 --> 01:13:10,063
God be with you.

495
01:13:10,706 --> 01:13:15,040
Shut up, Mother, you offended Him with
your actions

496
01:13:15,577 --> 01:13:19,274
I believe the devil is using Isabella .

497
01:13:20,415 --> 01:13:22,883
and he is also using the man

498
01:13:23,085 --> 01:13:26,452
whom you imprudently offered asylum

499
01:13:36,865 --> 01:13:41,234
Have you Mother, how can I say?
Fornicated with that man?

500
01:13:50,479 --> 01:13:52,811
Sister, my sister

501
01:13:55,317 --> 01:14:00,584
I feel guilty for what has happened to
you, forgive me

502
01:14:03,725 --> 01:14:05,818
Maybe God was kind with you

503
01:14:07,062 --> 01:14:09,121
granting you this madness

504
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:13,991
and letting you forget the men's cruelty.

505
01:14:15,771 --> 01:14:20,834
For me, for all of us, it will be worse

506
01:14:23,578 --> 01:14:27,105
we will have to pay for our sin day by
day

507
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:34,718
and maybe all our prayers would not be
enough.

508
01:15:36,351 --> 01:15:40,117
Listen to me, whoever you are, I am not
scared of you.

509
01:15:40,455 --> 01:15:42,582
I don't want others to pay for me

510
01:15:43,592 --> 01:15:44,752
I am the one who is challenging you

511
01:15:45,494 --> 01:15:48,156
take me if you can, unknown God.

512
01:15:55,003 --> 01:15:57,096
I will exorcize the whole convent

513
01:15:58,006 --> 01:16:01,999
everybody has to remain in the cells
until I am done.

514
01:16:02,444 --> 01:16:04,935
As you wish father, we will pray.

515
01:16:05,614 --> 01:16:09,607
No prayers. That will be worse since
God is angry with you.

516
01:16:10,552 --> 01:16:13,919
But father, we have to pray to ask for
forgiveness.

517
01:16:15,357 --> 01:16:18,053
Do what I ordered, no discussion, now
you can leave.

518
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:18,918
Amen.

519
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:42,817
I trust in you God, to defeat the prince
of hell

520
01:16:47,489 --> 01:16:51,050
here I am, beast, with God's help you
will soon be defeated.

521
01:18:12,674 --> 01:18:13,606
So they believe that?

522
01:18:16,044 --> 01:18:18,512
Trust me, the devil does not exist.

523
01:18:19,014 --> 01:18:21,539
If he did he would not be worst than
men

524
01:18:23,418 --> 01:18:24,715
The devil was fabricated by man

525
01:18:24,919 --> 01:18:28,855
like religion or laws, to put a leash on
human nature.

526
01:18:29,991 --> 01:18:32,221
You are not worried about your soul.

527
01:18:33,061 --> 01:18:37,896
No, I have only one rule, take what you
like when you like.

528
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:40,897
Never put off till tomorrow the sin you
can do today.

529
01:18:45,407 --> 01:18:47,637
Strange, you say you don't believe in
the devil

530
01:18:49,177 --> 01:18:51,407
but you at like you have the devil in
you.

531
01:18:51,780 --> 01:18:54,613
What? Don't tell me that a smart girl like
you

532
01:18:54,849 --> 01:18:56,111
believes those things...

533
01:18:56,484 --> 01:18:59,942
It's a question of name, definition, but
evil exists.

534
01:19:05,460 --> 01:19:06,620
Here I am, Satan.

535
01:19:30,452 --> 01:19:33,615
You will go back to hell defeated.

536
01:19:33,855 --> 01:19:38,451
Who can win over the power of God's
army.

537
01:19:39,728 --> 01:19:46,759
Because I am the Lord of the Universe,
evil will not prevail.

538
01:19:49,404 --> 01:19:58,608
I am ordering you to return to hell, leave
the house of God.

539
01:20:14,863 --> 01:20:18,128
It is exiting, but it is too risky, my
darling.

540
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,459
I've already slept with two nuns

541
01:20:23,037 --> 01:20:25,938
to kidnap a third, a noble one, will be
too much

542
01:20:26,875 --> 01:20:31,175
Governments like to hang a freethinker.

543
01:20:32,313 --> 01:20:33,974
But tell me, have you decided...

544
01:20:34,616 --> 01:20:35,708
To remain in the convent?

545
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:39,852
Absolutely not, I never had a all

546
01:20:41,356 --> 01:20:42,721
although I was expecting something, a
feeling

547
01:20:43,024 --> 01:20:43,820
but it has not happened.

548
01:20:45,093 --> 01:20:49,655
What is it Signor Bencio?

549
01:21:21,729 --> 01:21:25,631
Is it because you are not satisfied with
my offer?

550
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:30,367
I want you Isabella.

551
01:22:04,472 --> 01:22:05,166
Help me.

552
01:27:13,714 --> 01:27:14,544
You are so beautiful.

553
01:27:32,567 --> 01:27:34,558
Come here.

554
01:33:10,804 --> 01:33:16,606
Ceso, the cardinal will be here soon.
Where is the fruit?

555
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:22,308
It has happened again, it was him.

556
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:29,647
Ceso, when will you stop with those
superstitions?
