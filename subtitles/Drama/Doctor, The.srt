1
00:07:36,883 --> 00:07:38,509
What are they like, these girls?

2
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:43,281
They're very good. A bit wild.
Spend their money quickly. Work hard.

3
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:45,288
- Are they literate?
- Some of them.

4
00:07:45,554 --> 00:07:48,271
In and out of reformatories
from the day they were picked up.

5
00:07:48,338 --> 00:07:50,640
Jobs like this. It's degrading.

6
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:53,386
They shouldn't use human beings
to move earth.

7
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,352
No.

8
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,977
And it's not efficient.

9
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,058
If they were to give me
two more excavators...

10
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:59,625
...I'd be a year ahead of the plan by now.

11
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:01,325
You're an impatient generation.

12
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:02,375
Weren't you?

13
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,305
Yes, we were. Very.

14
00:08:05,204 --> 00:08:09,295
Don't be too impatient, Comrade Engineer,
we've come very far, very fast.

15
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,825
Yes, I know that, Comrade General.

16
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,355
Yes, but do you know what it cost?

17
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:17,233
There were children in those days
who lived off human flesh.

18
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,347
Did you know that?

19
00:08:27,059 --> 00:08:29,678
What is your interest in this girl,
Comrade General?

20
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,458
She may be my brother's child.

21
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:34,157
- Yuri Andreyevich?
- Yes.

22
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:37,356
My half-brother, I should say.

23
00:08:38,483 --> 00:08:39,825
If she is...

24
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,575
...she's also Lara's child.

25
00:08:44,563 --> 00:08:45,840
The Lara?

26
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,496
The Lara, yes.

27
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:54,574
This is a new edition of the "Lara Poems."

28
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:58,188
Yes, I know.
We admire your brother very much.

29
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:00,780
Yes, everybody seems to, now.

30
00:09:01,716 --> 00:09:05,196
Well, we couldn't admire him
when we weren't allowed to read him.

31
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:06,986
No.

32
00:09:22,132 --> 00:09:23,309
Come in.

33
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:30,125
I sent for you, Comrade.

34
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:32,717
You're not in any trouble.

35
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:46,835
I'm General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago.

36
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,253
I'm looking for someone.

37
00:09:51,572 --> 00:09:53,197
Do you understand?

38
00:09:56,724 --> 00:09:59,570
The person I'm looking for
would be my niece.

39
00:10:03,668 --> 00:10:04,977
Please sit down.

40
00:10:07,924 --> 00:10:09,134
Your name is--

41
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:11,407
Tonya Komarova, Comrade General.

42
00:10:11,827 --> 00:10:13,802
They found you in Mongolia, didn't they?

43
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:17,550
- Yes, Comrade General.
- What were you doing there?

44
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:19,081
I was lost, Comrade General.

45
00:10:19,155 --> 00:10:21,064
How did you come to be lost?

46
00:10:21,843 --> 00:10:22,825
I've forgotten.

47
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:25,070
Was Komarovsky your father's name?

48
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,081
I suppose so, Comrade General.

49
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,595
You suppose so?

50
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:30,388
It's a common name.

51
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:32,339
Do you remember your father?

52
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,674
No.

53
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,718
Do you remember your mother?

54
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,667
Yes, I remember my mother.

55
00:10:39,956 --> 00:10:41,385
What was her name?

56
00:10:42,164 --> 00:10:43,211
"Mammy."

57
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,306
What was she like?
I mean, what did she look like?

58
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,388
Big.

59
00:10:50,195 --> 00:10:51,275
Big?

60
00:10:51,988 --> 00:10:55,119
I was little. She looked big.

61
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:04,207
- Can you read?
- Yes.

62
00:11:05,588 --> 00:11:09,416
"Lara. A Cycle of Poems, by Y.A. Zhivago."

63
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:12,171
Not me. My half-brother.

64
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:16,398
The person I'm looking for...

65
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,628
...would be this man's daughter.

66
00:11:23,924 --> 00:11:25,550
This would be her mother.

67
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,836
"Lara."

68
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:34,992
Did anybody ever call your mother Lara?

69
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:38,612
I don't know. I don't think so.

70
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,118
She's nice.

71
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,761
I'm not your niece, Comrade General.

72
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,196
Well, I'm nobody's idea of an uncle.

73
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,522
But if this man were my father,
I should want to know.

74
00:11:54,068 --> 00:11:56,850
Did your mother ever tell you
your father was a poet?

75
00:11:56,916 --> 00:11:58,956
Comrade General, my father wasn't a poet.

76
00:11:59,028 --> 00:12:00,522
What was your father?

77
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:01,966
Not a poet.

78
00:12:06,485 --> 00:12:08,241
Did you like your father?

79
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:09,934
I've forgotten.

80
00:12:10,005 --> 00:12:12,045
But you liked your mother?

81
00:12:12,629 --> 00:12:14,035
Yes, of course.

82
00:12:17,332 --> 00:12:20,627
Does the name "Strelnikov"
mean anything to you? "Strelnikov"?

83
00:12:23,668 --> 00:12:24,879
"Varykino"?

84
00:12:25,524 --> 00:12:27,597
That's a place, not a person.

85
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:29,873
"Gromeko"?

86
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,758
- Gromeko?
- Yes.

87
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,600
You see...

88
00:12:36,404 --> 00:12:38,292
...he lost his mother...

89
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,783
...at about the same age you were...

90
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:44,754
...when your mother lost you.

91
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,806
And, in the same part of the world.

92
00:14:14,741 --> 00:14:17,905
Now is life's artful triumph
of vanities destroyed...

93
00:14:18,229 --> 00:14:21,131
...for the spirit has vanished
from its tabernacle...

94
00:14:21,332 --> 00:14:22,958
...its clay groweth black.

95
00:14:23,189 --> 00:14:27,083
The vessel is shattered, voiceless,
emotionless, dead.

96
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:31,379
Committing which unto the grave,
let us beseech the Lord...

97
00:14:32,117 --> 00:14:35,434
...that He will give her eternal rest.

98
00:15:41,461 --> 00:15:42,508
Yuri?

99
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:15,123
You and your husband will dine with us,
Madame Gromeko.

100
00:16:15,221 --> 00:16:16,531
Thank you, Father.

101
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,004
Will you lie down, then, Yuri?

102
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:25,999
Your mammy and I were great,
great friends, you know...

103
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,787
...so now we are going to look after you.

104
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,992
Thank you.

105
00:16:35,446 --> 00:16:36,722
That's mother's.

106
00:16:36,918 --> 00:16:38,325
It's yours now.

107
00:16:38,422 --> 00:16:40,210
Yes, Yuri. Mammy left it to you.

108
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:41,809
In her will.

109
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,591
Do you know what a will is, old chap?

110
00:16:45,077 --> 00:16:46,091
Money.

111
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:50,381
No, Yuri, just this.
Your daddy has all the money.

112
00:16:50,741 --> 00:16:52,432
Can you play it?

113
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,113
I thought all the people in this part
of the world could play the balalaika.

114
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,254
You don't live here, do you?

115
00:16:58,358 --> 00:16:59,667
No, we live in Moscow.

116
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,701
That's a long way from here,
but you will like Moscow.

117
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,006
- Won't he?
- In a bit.

118
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,598
It takes time
to get used to things, doesn't it?

119
00:17:07,798 --> 00:17:09,522
Mother could play it.

120
00:17:10,454 --> 00:17:13,137
Well, your mother was an artist, Yuri.

121
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:17,845
She could make this common
little instrument sound like two guitars.

122
00:17:18,198 --> 00:17:19,888
Your mother had a gift.

123
00:17:19,989 --> 00:17:21,713
Perhaps Yuri's got a gift.

124
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,154
Would you like lessons?

125
00:17:23,221 --> 00:17:24,683
I can't play it.

126
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:31,569
Say good night to Yuri, Tonya.

127
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:36,428
He's your brother, now.

128
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,164
Good night, Yuri.

129
00:17:42,677 --> 00:17:44,139
Good night, old chap.

130
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,423
Good night.

131
00:18:55,797 --> 00:18:58,318
The Gromekos dldn't know
what to make of hlm.

132
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:03,028
He made hls reputatlon as a poet
whlle he was studylng to be a doctor.

133
00:19:03,574 --> 00:19:06,476
He sald that poetry was no more
of a vocatlon than good health.

134
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:08,851
What he needed was a job.

135
00:19:09,078 --> 00:19:10,026
Pretty?

136
00:19:10,806 --> 00:19:11,754
Very.

137
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:18,957
Yeah. It's their right to be pretty.

138
00:19:21,046 --> 00:19:22,835
What will you do next year, Zhivago?

139
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,692
I thought of doing general practice.

140
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:26,766
Think about doing pure research.

141
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:29,300
It's exciting, important, tender, beautiful.

142
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:30,928
General practice.

143
00:19:31,062 --> 00:19:33,396
Life. He wants to see life. Well...

144
00:19:34,038 --> 00:19:37,333
You'll find that pretty creatures
do ugly things to people.

145
00:21:10,871 --> 00:21:12,180
What's your name?

146
00:21:13,591 --> 00:21:14,518
Antipov.

147
00:21:14,582 --> 00:21:15,564
Address?

148
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,068
15 Patrofka.

149
00:21:17,271 --> 00:21:18,318
I'll have these.

150
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,846
We have permission
from the chief of police.

151
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,538
- Well, you claim them at the station.
- When?

152
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:25,711
Now if you like.

153
00:21:25,814 --> 00:21:26,992
Very well.

154
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:29,172
He's my brother.

155
00:21:30,454 --> 00:21:33,750
Well, take him home, Miss.
Before he gets into trouble.

156
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,462
Pasha, please!

157
00:21:41,527 --> 00:21:43,119
It's got to be done.

158
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:44,945
Pasha, why has it got to be done?

159
00:21:45,014 --> 00:21:47,021
For them. For the Revolution.

160
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:50,613
- Pasha, they don't want a revolution.
- Yes, they do.

161
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:52,534
They don't know it yet,
but that's what they want.

162
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,192
Give me some of those, Comrade.

163
00:21:56,119 --> 00:21:59,086
Pasha, are you a Bolshevik?

164
00:21:59,254 --> 00:22:02,484
No. The Bolsheviks don't like me.
And I don't like them.

165
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,625
They don't know right from wrong.

166
00:22:04,727 --> 00:22:07,574
Pasha Antipov, you're an awful prig.

167
00:22:13,527 --> 00:22:15,566
Why did you tell him I was your brother?

168
00:22:16,215 --> 00:22:18,451
Well, what else could I have told him?

169
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:21,103
You could have told him I was your fiance.

170
00:22:21,367 --> 00:22:23,440
Pasha, don't be silly. I'm--

171
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:31,341
Monsieur Komarovsky has come to see
my mother on business.

172
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:34,613
People gossip around here.

173
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:36,140
It's the system, Lara.

174
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,700
People will be different
after the Revolution.

175
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,872
Will you come?

176
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,252
No, Pasha.

177
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:48,685
I've got exams to take, Pasha.
I've got to get my scholarship.

178
00:23:12,919 --> 00:23:14,228
Hello, Auntie.

179
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,786
There's a letter for you.

180
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:18,326
From Paris.

181
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:21,804
Lovely writing.

182
00:23:21,879 --> 00:23:23,405
She's coming home next month.

183
00:23:23,478 --> 00:23:26,031
Tonya? Oh, that's good!

184
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,820
He does seem to be very well informed.

185
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,313
And such a handsome figure of--

186
00:23:39,863 --> 00:23:42,002
Good evening, Mama. Madame.

187
00:23:42,168 --> 00:23:43,412
Larissa.

188
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:46,900
You can work in there, dear.
Monsieur Komarovsky's here.

189
00:24:06,071 --> 00:24:07,500
Good evening, Larissa.

190
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,782
Good evening, Monsieur.

191
00:24:15,447 --> 00:24:17,619
He advises some very important people.

192
00:24:17,688 --> 00:24:18,899
Yes, I know.

193
00:24:18,968 --> 00:24:20,942
I believe he has government connections.

194
00:24:21,016 --> 00:24:22,609
I don't know, I'm sure.

195
00:24:22,872 --> 00:24:25,261
Isn't he very expensive?

196
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:29,232
Monsieur Komarovsky advises me
out of kindness, Baroness.

197
00:24:29,495 --> 00:24:31,252
He was a friend of my late husband.

198
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,629
Oh, I see.

199
00:24:32,728 --> 00:24:33,840
Allow me.

200
00:25:02,648 --> 00:25:04,687
Tuesday, if I can, my dear. Goodbye.

201
00:25:21,815 --> 00:25:23,309
Where did you get this?

202
00:25:23,383 --> 00:25:25,423
A friend gave it to me,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

203
00:25:25,495 --> 00:25:27,600
You're not to go
to this peaceful demonstration.

204
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:28,303
No, Monsieur.

205
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:30,514
It may not be as peaceful as they think.

206
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:34,006
That's all I have to say.
Tell your friend that she's a silly creature.

207
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:36,627
Yes, Monsieur.

208
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:48,845
How old are you now?

209
00:25:49,944 --> 00:25:51,406
Seventeen, Monsieur.

210
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,133
A hundred and three.

211
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,989
Oh, dear.
And I was so looking forward to it.

212
00:27:09,304 --> 00:27:11,825
Oh, never mind. I'll be all right here.

213
00:27:12,249 --> 00:27:14,966
You will take Lara, won't you,
Victor Yppolitovich?

214
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:17,846
It is so stupid of me!
It's her first long gown.

215
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:23,214
I think you'd better call it right off.

216
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:24,662
Yes. I'll stay with you.

217
00:27:24,728 --> 00:27:27,696
Nonsense! I'll be perfectly all right.
I've got a book.

218
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:30,190
It's so disappointing for her,
Victor Yppolitovich.

219
00:27:30,264 --> 00:27:33,712
There's so little opportunity
to mix with good society.

220
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:37,294
Very well. Get your coat.

221
00:27:38,873 --> 00:27:40,367
We're late, if we're going.

222
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:42,132
I want to avoid Kropotkin Street.

223
00:28:18,456 --> 00:28:21,970
"Brotherhood and freedom."
Yuri, what splendid words.

224
00:28:23,768 --> 00:28:25,972
"Justice, equality and bread."

225
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:28,885
Don't you think they're splendid?

226
00:28:28,953 --> 00:28:30,000
Yes, I do.

227
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:32,179
"Brotherhood and freedom."

228
00:28:32,249 --> 00:28:35,664
Brotherhood and fiddlesticks!
You're frozen through.

229
00:28:36,025 --> 00:28:38,895
You've no right, Annushka. It isn't fair.

230
00:28:43,897 --> 00:28:45,784
We'd given you up, Monsieur.

231
00:28:46,617 --> 00:28:48,722
My niece. Coat, Lara.

232
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:54,767
Charmante.

233
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:56,370
Come, my dear.

234
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,373
How's the Foie de Veau, Gascoigne?

235
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:25,935
As always, Monsieur.

236
00:29:26,041 --> 00:29:28,944
- All right. Not too much--
- Not too much mustard, Monsieur.

237
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:34,606
- Jambon Farcl en Crote.
- Oul, Mademolselle.

238
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:36,882
Wine, Monsieur?

239
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,583
A little light wine, yes.

240
00:29:38,649 --> 00:29:40,471
Oul, Monsleur. Mademolselle.

241
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:44,725
This place must be dreadfully expensive,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

242
00:29:46,297 --> 00:29:47,409
It is.

243
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,095
Why not "Victor Yppolitovich"?

244
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,104
I can't.

245
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,650
Mother made this dress.

246
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:23,218
Very nice.

247
00:30:24,153 --> 00:30:25,811
She's clever, isn't she?

248
00:30:26,073 --> 00:30:28,757
Your mother? Yes. Fine little woman.

249
00:31:09,914 --> 00:31:12,531
No doubt they'll sing in tune
after the Revolution.

250
00:32:13,049 --> 00:32:14,194
Prepare!

251
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:37,040
Mount!

252
00:33:47,674 --> 00:33:49,332
Tote sabers!

253
00:35:11,322 --> 00:35:12,784
What, what?

254
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:14,195
What?

255
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:47,735
- Good night, dear.
- Good night...

256
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:49,656
...Victor Yppolitovich.

257
00:36:03,354 --> 00:36:05,591
Go inside your houses, please.

258
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,208
All these people will be taken care of.

259
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,128
Go inside, please.

260
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:13,109
All these people will be taken care of.

261
00:36:13,434 --> 00:36:14,896
Go inside, please.

262
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:22,260
Get inside.

263
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,860
Yuri, please. No trouble.

264
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:30,675
Take him inside, sir,
or I'll put him under arrest.

265
00:36:30,811 --> 00:36:34,488
Yuri, I beg you.
Tonya's coming home tomorrow.

266
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:01,399
Daddy!

267
00:38:07,292 --> 00:38:08,917
There, now, that's enough.

268
00:38:09,755 --> 00:38:11,861
Your mother, your mother.

269
00:38:14,587 --> 00:38:15,635
Mammy!

270
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:25,014
Mammy, how are you?

271
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,470
Me? Fit as a fiddle.

272
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:30,713
Turn 'round.

273
00:38:33,947 --> 00:38:36,086
Well, they've taught her something.

274
00:38:44,378 --> 00:38:46,997
- Look at that!
- Isn't Yuri looking well, Tonya?

275
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:49,936
Yes. Well, let's get along, dear.

276
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:51,866
Yes. Run along, you two.

277
00:38:56,476 --> 00:39:00,087
I brought you this. It has a piece in it
about young Russian poets.

278
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:02,740
Oh, good! Thank you.
Does it mention me?

279
00:39:03,612 --> 00:39:05,751
It begins with you. You're the best.

280
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:09,173
Very intelligent nation, the French.

281
00:39:09,339 --> 00:39:11,227
They have their heads together.

282
00:39:11,292 --> 00:39:13,332
Yes. They're looking at the paper.

283
00:39:13,884 --> 00:39:15,509
They're head over heels--

284
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,106
Annushka, stop it!

285
00:39:17,979 --> 00:39:20,848
Good marriages are made in Heaven,
or some such place.

286
00:39:30,332 --> 00:39:31,990
Victor Yppolitovich?

287
00:39:35,962 --> 00:39:37,457
I want to talk to you.

288
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:40,274
No, Pasha.

289
00:39:40,379 --> 00:39:41,841
It's important.

290
00:39:43,644 --> 00:39:44,659
All right.

291
00:39:54,588 --> 00:39:56,115
How did you do it?

292
00:39:56,379 --> 00:39:57,525
I didn't.

293
00:39:58,716 --> 00:39:59,992
A Dragoon did.

294
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:03,669
Oh, Pasha, darling!

295
00:40:04,253 --> 00:40:05,529
Come, come.

296
00:40:08,603 --> 00:40:10,643
- Where's your mother?
- Asleep.

297
00:40:27,707 --> 00:40:30,009
Pasha, I can't deal with this.

298
00:40:30,172 --> 00:40:31,766
Have you got any iodine?

299
00:40:31,868 --> 00:40:33,527
- Yes, but--
- Get it.

300
00:40:46,139 --> 00:40:47,481
Will it hurt?

301
00:40:49,692 --> 00:40:51,350
Pasha, darling!

302
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:56,314
Pasha, you must go to a hospital!

303
00:40:57,563 --> 00:40:59,734
I daren't for a day or two.

304
00:41:01,276 --> 00:41:03,927
- Will you do something for me?
- Oh, yes. What?

305
00:41:05,532 --> 00:41:06,939
Hide this.

306
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,684
Oh, throw it away!

307
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:14,714
No.

308
00:41:15,644 --> 00:41:18,065
There'll be no more
peaceful demonstrations.

309
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:21,436
There were women and children, Lara,
and they rode them down.

310
00:41:22,076 --> 00:41:24,465
Starving women asking for bread.

311
00:41:24,637 --> 00:41:28,434
On Tamskaya Avenue, the pigs
were eating and drinking and dancing!

312
00:41:29,053 --> 00:41:30,262
Hide it for me.

313
00:41:34,236 --> 00:41:35,895
Thanks, Comrade.

314
00:41:36,188 --> 00:41:38,610
Pasha, darling, I'm not your comrade.

315
00:41:38,716 --> 00:41:39,829
Lara?

316
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,686
- Yes?
- Who is there?

317
00:41:45,757 --> 00:41:47,349
It's only Pasha.

318
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:51,611
You came in very late last night, dear.

319
00:41:51,708 --> 00:41:53,781
The time went so quickly.

320
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:55,218
Good.

321
00:41:56,316 --> 00:41:57,909
Are you going to church?

322
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,282
Yes.

323
00:42:10,435 --> 00:42:13,501
You know what our Lord said
to the woman taken in adultery?

324
00:42:14,211 --> 00:42:15,421
Yes, Father.

325
00:42:15,716 --> 00:42:17,538
He said, "Go and sin no more."

326
00:42:17,603 --> 00:42:18,781
And, did she?

327
00:42:20,067 --> 00:42:22,521
- I don't know, Father.
- Nobody does, child.

328
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:25,182
The flesh is not weak.

329
00:42:25,378 --> 00:42:28,640
It is strong. Only the sacrament
of marriage will contain it.

330
00:42:28,995 --> 00:42:30,173
Remember that.

331
00:42:58,019 --> 00:42:59,099
Monsieur...

332
00:43:00,195 --> 00:43:03,992
It's Number Six, this evening, sir.
The most important person here.

333
00:43:15,203 --> 00:43:16,610
Sorry, I'm late.

334
00:43:17,091 --> 00:43:19,458
I've been waiting nearly an hour, Victor.

335
00:43:19,811 --> 00:43:21,088
Have you ordered?

336
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:22,720
No.

337
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:25,208
Well, you should have done.

338
00:43:46,595 --> 00:43:48,024
You chose it, Victor.

339
00:43:52,164 --> 00:43:54,204
You've grown up a lot, haven't you?

340
00:43:55,044 --> 00:43:55,993
Yes.

341
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,049
What did you tell your mama tonight?

342
00:43:58,116 --> 00:43:59,425
Victor, don't!

343
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:03,394
- May I smoke?
- Yes, of course.

344
00:44:08,067 --> 00:44:11,101
You like it, don't you? Cigar smoke?

345
00:44:12,899 --> 00:44:14,306
Come along, my dear.

346
00:44:15,683 --> 00:44:16,861
Sant!

347
00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:19,168
Sant!

348
00:44:23,171 --> 00:44:24,447
Drink, drink.

349
00:44:25,219 --> 00:44:27,161
Up, up, up.

350
00:44:43,715 --> 00:44:46,715
Where did you tell her
we were going, your mama?

351
00:44:48,164 --> 00:44:49,440
She didn't ask.

352
00:44:49,796 --> 00:44:51,868
- That's because she knows.
- No, she doesn't.

353
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,361
You'd both take an oath she doesn't.
But she does.

354
00:44:54,435 --> 00:44:56,159
And you both know she does.

355
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:57,501
Victor, don't!

356
00:44:57,859 --> 00:44:58,688
What?

357
00:44:58,756 --> 00:44:59,868
Torment me.

358
00:44:59,939 --> 00:45:03,136
Torment? Oh, what a little hypocrite it is.

359
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,902
I'm going, now, Victor.

360
00:45:08,483 --> 00:45:10,076
Whatever you like, dear.

361
00:45:13,283 --> 00:45:15,617
You see, you'll always come back.

362
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,544
Stay, darling.

363
00:45:27,556 --> 00:45:28,766
Stay.

364
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,177
Wake up! Here, take this.

365
00:46:26,373 --> 00:46:28,445
You show it to someone
if you lose your way.

366
00:46:28,516 --> 00:46:31,679
Professor Boris Kurt. And, you find him.
Now, go on.

367
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:33,726
Professor Boris Kurt.

368
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:51,259
But, Boris, this is genius.

369
00:46:51,459 --> 00:46:54,808
Really, I thought it was Rachmaninoff?.
I'm going for a smoke.

370
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:07,103
And how's the general practitioner?

371
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:08,991
A bit scared of his finals.

372
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:11,097
Well, I don't think he need be.

373
00:47:11,332 --> 00:47:14,464
How do you like the idea of marrying
a general practitioner?

374
00:47:14,981 --> 00:47:17,850
I like it very much.
But no general practitioner has asked me.

375
00:47:17,924 --> 00:47:18,720
No?

376
00:47:19,205 --> 00:47:21,310
I thought you nomads were hot-blooded.

377
00:47:21,381 --> 00:47:23,354
A slow lot, these general practitioners.

378
00:47:23,427 --> 00:47:25,849
How do you fancy
a professor of pathology?

379
00:47:26,564 --> 00:47:27,993
Does he write poetry?

380
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:29,533
Alas, no.

381
00:47:29,956 --> 00:47:32,706
Then I'm afraid it's out of the question.
Excuse me.

382
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:44,827
That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.

383
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,977
Yes, I'd noticed.

384
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,050
It's for you.

385
00:48:08,452 --> 00:48:11,136
How would the poet like to see
a bit of general practice?

386
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:18,305
Boris, thank God you've come.
This is very good of you, Boris.

387
00:48:18,372 --> 00:48:20,576
Yes, I know it is. My assistant.

388
00:48:20,676 --> 00:48:22,170
- How do you do?
- Where is she?

389
00:48:22,244 --> 00:48:23,357
This way.

390
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:39,229
When did she do it?

391
00:48:39,301 --> 00:48:41,309
About eight o'clock this evening.

392
00:48:46,116 --> 00:48:47,458
Do you know what it was?

393
00:48:52,549 --> 00:48:54,273
Why didn't you get a local doctor?

394
00:48:54,341 --> 00:48:56,381
- I couldn't.
- No, I suppose you couldn't.

395
00:48:56,453 --> 00:48:57,500
Come on in.

396
00:48:59,461 --> 00:49:00,738
Turn her over.

397
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:07,003
All right.

398
00:49:09,444 --> 00:49:10,338
Water.

399
00:49:25,316 --> 00:49:28,099
Now, Yuri. Come on, dear. Come on.

400
00:49:29,157 --> 00:49:30,368
Now, Yuri.

401
00:49:32,006 --> 00:49:33,216
Come on, dear.

402
00:49:34,118 --> 00:49:35,100
Come on, Yuri.

403
00:49:35,174 --> 00:49:36,155
Sorry.

404
00:49:37,605 --> 00:49:40,322
Well, my dear, that's it.

405
00:49:41,221 --> 00:49:42,682
That's it. Good.

406
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:43,836
Good.

407
00:49:45,093 --> 00:49:46,304
Good.

408
00:49:53,604 --> 00:49:55,131
Is she going to live?

409
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,788
Water.

410
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,917
- She is, isn't she?
- Yes.

411
00:50:07,237 --> 00:50:08,316
Funny thing.

412
00:50:08,389 --> 00:50:11,291
There's a man, speaks on public platforms.

413
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:15,101
In with the government.
In with the Liberals. In with everybody.

414
00:50:15,396 --> 00:50:16,804
And he risks it all.

415
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,399
For that!

416
00:50:19,429 --> 00:50:21,535
That's not how poets see them, is it?

417
00:50:21,606 --> 00:50:23,460
That's how GPs see them.

418
00:50:23,942 --> 00:50:25,349
That's how they are.

419
00:50:26,309 --> 00:50:28,676
You know, from here, she looks beautiful.

420
00:50:29,285 --> 00:50:31,521
Zhivago, I think you're a hard case.

421
00:50:36,838 --> 00:50:39,685
There's a child in the case.
A child. Her daughter.

422
00:50:39,749 --> 00:50:41,637
Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris--

423
00:50:42,086 --> 00:50:44,987
She might have thought about "Lara"
before she did it.

424
00:50:45,444 --> 00:50:46,590
Does the girl know?

425
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:48,068
I'm afraid she does.

426
00:50:48,772 --> 00:50:50,496
- Is she here?
- Yes.

427
00:50:51,429 --> 00:50:53,851
Tell her that her mother's going to live.

428
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:57,315
Wait a minute, Victor. Yurian.

429
00:50:57,541 --> 00:50:58,818
Yes, of course.

430
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:03,071
What are we going to say about this?

431
00:51:04,324 --> 00:51:05,951
- Must we say anything?
- I'm afraid so.

432
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:08,956
I'm taking her to the hospital.
We'll have to say something.

433
00:51:09,062 --> 00:51:11,451
You know that needn't be difficult, Boris.

434
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:39,839
- What is the name of your assistant?
- Zhivago.

435
00:53:40,070 --> 00:53:41,248
Andreyevich?

436
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:43,390
Yes, why? Do you know him?

437
00:53:43,975 --> 00:53:46,244
No, I knew his father slightly.

438
00:53:46,662 --> 00:53:47,610
Fine.

439
00:53:57,286 --> 00:54:00,635
Cheer up, Yuri. I'll have the poor bitch
in hospital tonight.

440
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:02,180
What's his name?

441
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:05,892
That's Victor Komarovsky.
He says he knows you.

442
00:54:06,214 --> 00:54:08,188
He executed my father's will.

443
00:54:08,838 --> 00:54:10,626
Uncle Alex turned it down.

444
00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:13,251
By Komarovsky's account
there wasn't much in it.

445
00:54:13,318 --> 00:54:15,390
And what there was
belonged to Komarovsky.

446
00:54:15,462 --> 00:54:17,470
Oh, he's a very good businessman.

447
00:54:17,958 --> 00:54:19,781
But I doubt that he's crooked.

448
00:54:20,134 --> 00:54:22,501
Very good company. Knows life.

449
00:54:23,622 --> 00:54:25,532
He's had a bad scare tonight.

450
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,918
You don't mind coming here, do you,
Victor Yppolitovich?

451
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:48,543
No, no. It reminds me of my youth.

452
00:54:51,526 --> 00:54:53,631
- I went to the hospital again.
- And?

453
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:58,044
She wants you to go and forgive her.
For her suspicions.

454
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:00,419
You can tell her the truth
if you like, Larissa.

455
00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:08,030
Is this him?

456
00:55:08,262 --> 00:55:09,278
Yes.

457
00:55:09,703 --> 00:55:11,524
- He knows nothing about--
- No.

458
00:55:17,895 --> 00:55:20,382
Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.

459
00:55:23,526 --> 00:55:25,119
Please.

460
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,725
- Will you eat?
- No, thank you.

461
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,272
I hope you don't think this is impertinent,
Pavel Pavlovich.

462
00:55:38,342 --> 00:55:39,324
Not at all.

463
00:55:39,398 --> 00:55:42,879
I am...I have been advising
Larissa's mother for many years.

464
00:55:43,207 --> 00:55:44,994
I'm interested in what happens to her.

465
00:55:45,061 --> 00:55:47,134
There's something I have to tell you.
And that is this:

466
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,882
I am committed to the Revolution.

467
00:55:51,238 --> 00:55:52,350
Nothing...

468
00:55:53,190 --> 00:55:56,703
...not even Lara,
has more importance for me.

469
00:55:58,695 --> 00:56:00,069
You misunderstand.

470
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,716
Your political views do not concern me.

471
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:06,107
So far as that goes, I'm probably
more in sympathy than you suppose.

472
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:09,216
I have a few contacts of my own,
which might surprise you.

473
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,238
How do you propose to live?

474
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:13,026
I've been offered a teaching post.

475
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:15,877
- May I know where?
- Gradov. It's in the Urals.

476
00:56:15,943 --> 00:56:18,146
I know it. Not much of a place.

477
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:20,644
It's beautiful country,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

478
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,685
It'll be a quiet life, won't it?

479
00:56:23,078 --> 00:56:24,507
That's what we want.

480
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,942
Well, you'll excuse me.
Will your salary be adequate?

481
00:56:28,039 --> 00:56:29,632
Adequate. If not more.

482
00:56:33,287 --> 00:56:37,443
Pavel Pavlovich, my chief impression is,
and I mean no offense...

483
00:56:37,958 --> 00:56:39,518
...is that you're very young.

484
00:56:39,590 --> 00:56:42,143
Monsieur Komarovsky,
I hope I don't offend you.

485
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:43,968
Do people improve with age?

486
00:56:44,582 --> 00:56:46,274
They grow a little more tolerant.

487
00:56:46,343 --> 00:56:48,732
Because they have more
to tolerate in themselves.

488
00:56:48,871 --> 00:56:51,870
If people don't marry young,
what do they bring to their marriage?

489
00:56:52,102 --> 00:56:54,110
A little experience.

490
00:56:54,503 --> 00:56:58,180
I'm 26. My mother died, needlessly,
when I was eight.

491
00:56:58,343 --> 00:57:01,474
My father died in prison.
I have fended for myself.

492
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,129
I've worked my way
through higher school and university.

493
00:57:04,199 --> 00:57:07,134
I am familiar with things
that you can hardly guess at.

494
00:57:07,399 --> 00:57:09,886
All this is an experience
of a kind, certainly.

495
00:57:10,502 --> 00:57:12,924
I've no amorous experience,
if that's what you mean.

496
00:57:12,999 --> 00:57:16,708
None whatever. Lara's 17.
That speaks for itself.

497
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:20,291
You probably find this situation comic.
We don't.

498
00:57:20,455 --> 00:57:22,756
We're going to be married next year.

499
00:57:30,182 --> 00:57:32,550
I hope I haven't offended you
by speaking plainly.

500
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:34,142
Not at all. Admirable.

501
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:43,781
A young crusader.

502
00:57:43,911 --> 00:57:45,089
Oh, he's not--

503
00:57:45,159 --> 00:57:48,093
He's a very fine young man.
That's obvious.

504
00:57:49,319 --> 00:57:51,686
You're very generous,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

505
00:57:54,727 --> 00:57:56,637
Larissa, I want to talk to you.

506
00:58:05,670 --> 00:58:07,613
Monsieur Komarovsky, will you--

507
00:58:08,294 --> 00:58:09,855
I beg you.

508
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:13,156
Drop this affectation of addressing me
as "Monsieur Komarovsky"!

509
00:58:13,447 --> 00:58:16,380
Under the circumstances,
I find it rather ridiculous.

510
00:58:16,582 --> 00:58:20,194
Lara, I am determined to save you
from a dreadful error.

511
00:58:20,711 --> 00:58:24,509
There are two kinds of men, and only two.
And that young man is one kind.

512
00:58:24,615 --> 00:58:26,884
He is high-minded. He is pure.

513
00:58:27,208 --> 00:58:31,101
He is the kind of man that the world
pretends to look up to and despises.

514
00:58:31,911 --> 00:58:36,286
He's the kind of man who breeds
unhappiness, particularly in women.

515
00:58:36,455 --> 00:58:37,764
- Do you understand?
- No.

516
00:58:37,831 --> 00:58:38,976
I think you do.

517
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,343
There's another kind.

518
00:58:41,543 --> 00:58:44,859
Not high-minded. Not pure, but alive.

519
00:58:45,576 --> 00:58:49,536
That your tastes at this time should incline
toward the juvenile is understandable.

520
00:58:49,607 --> 00:58:52,607
But, for you to marry that boy
would be a disaster.

521
00:58:52,871 --> 00:58:55,042
Because, there are two kinds of women.

522
00:58:56,391 --> 00:59:00,450
There are two kinds of women and you,
as we well know, are not the first kind.

523
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:08,006
You, my dear, are a slut.

524
00:59:09,223 --> 00:59:10,717
I am not!

525
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:13,218
We'll see.

526
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,492
And, don't delude yourself
that this was rape.

527
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,389
That would flatter us both.

528
01:00:43,719 --> 01:00:45,507
The master's not at home, Miss Lara.

529
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:46,720
Not at home?

530
01:00:46,791 --> 01:00:49,792
No. He went to
the Sventytskis' Christmas party.

531
01:00:52,264 --> 01:00:54,053
Are you going there, Miss?

532
01:00:55,081 --> 01:00:56,903
Please don't say I told you.

533
01:00:57,128 --> 01:00:58,557
No, thank you, Piotr.

534
01:00:58,761 --> 01:01:00,703
Merry Christmas, Miss Lara.

535
01:01:01,928 --> 01:01:04,099
Oh, thank you,
and Merry Christmas to you.

536
01:01:09,928 --> 01:01:12,001
Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.

537
01:01:52,264 --> 01:01:53,573
What's the matter?

538
01:01:57,576 --> 01:02:00,195
We had an appointment this evening.
Where are you going?

539
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:02,402
Haven't you got the letter? I left a letter--

540
01:02:02,472 --> 01:02:04,742
I've not been home. I'm going home, now.

541
01:02:06,665 --> 01:02:09,314
Where're you going, Lara?
I've a right to know.

542
01:02:09,704 --> 01:02:11,198
What's in this letter?

543
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:14,303
What's in this letter?

544
01:02:17,672 --> 01:02:18,784
Are you breaking--

545
01:02:18,855 --> 01:02:20,546
- It's all in the letter.
- What is?

546
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:21,761
Everything.

547
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:23,489
Don't!

548
01:03:25,833 --> 01:03:28,550
Yuri, there's an extraordinary girl
at this party.

549
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:30,823
I know. I'm dancing with her.

550
01:03:33,192 --> 01:03:34,752
You're keen tonight, Victor.

551
01:03:34,824 --> 01:03:36,101
I like to win.

552
01:03:36,488 --> 01:03:37,503
Silence!

553
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,640
Silence, everybody! Silence, please!

554
01:03:41,449 --> 01:03:44,482
I have a very delightful announcement
to make.

555
01:03:47,176 --> 01:03:48,671
Oh, Madame Sventytski!

556
01:03:48,905 --> 01:03:50,081
Yes. Why not?

557
01:03:51,272 --> 01:03:54,206
I have to announce that Dr. Yuri Zhivago--

558
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:57,666
Doctor Zhivago,
he came third in all Moscow.

559
01:04:00,201 --> 01:04:02,208
Now, listen, please!

560
01:04:02,377 --> 01:04:04,799
Dr. Zhivago is betrothed in marriage to--

561
01:04:27,337 --> 01:04:28,798
My dear Victor!

562
01:04:30,088 --> 01:04:31,266
My dear man!

563
01:04:31,465 --> 01:04:32,675
Get her out.

564
01:04:33,225 --> 01:04:34,173
What?

565
01:04:34,281 --> 01:04:36,550
Get her out. Get her out!

566
01:04:37,096 --> 01:04:38,984
Yes. Yes. I'll get the police.

567
01:04:39,049 --> 01:04:40,030
No!

568
01:04:40,488 --> 01:04:42,244
I don't want you to get the police.

569
01:04:42,888 --> 01:04:45,922
I do not want the police.
I just want you to get her out!

570
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:05,187
Let her go!

571
01:05:28,617 --> 01:05:29,565
Please!

572
01:05:29,672 --> 01:05:32,160
Quiet, please. Please. Give way.

573
01:05:32,232 --> 01:05:34,120
Please, would you mind?

574
01:05:35,145 --> 01:05:37,250
Would you mind? Thank you, thank you.

575
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:51,686
Our destinies seem to be interwoven,
don't they?

576
01:05:51,753 --> 01:05:52,615
Yes.

577
01:05:53,321 --> 01:05:55,460
I was a close friend of your father.

578
01:05:56,169 --> 01:05:58,308
I knew you were his business partner.

579
01:05:58,378 --> 01:06:01,476
Rather more than that.
I was present at his death.

580
01:06:03,656 --> 01:06:06,023
Also, I am in contact with your brother.

581
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:07,428
Yevgraf?.

582
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:10,246
I should say I'm in contact with those
who are in contact with him.

583
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:12,419
Oh, I disagree with Bolshevism.

584
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:13,824
Thank you.

585
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:16,968
You seem to know your trade.

586
01:06:17,130 --> 01:06:20,227
But, I can still admire Bolsheviks, as men.

587
01:06:21,896 --> 01:06:23,969
Shall I tell you why?

588
01:06:24,201 --> 01:06:25,216
Yes.

589
01:06:27,144 --> 01:06:28,421
They may win.

590
01:06:31,274 --> 01:06:33,478
I'd like to meet him, Yevgraf.

591
01:06:33,866 --> 01:06:35,753
He sent me a marvelous letter.

592
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:37,791
He likes my poetry.

593
01:06:38,697 --> 01:06:40,836
That would have pleased your father.

594
01:06:41,417 --> 01:06:44,833
Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.
If I may call you Yuri?

595
01:06:45,193 --> 01:06:46,720
I hardly knew him.

596
01:06:48,329 --> 01:06:50,402
You perhaps may not credit this...

597
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:53,860
...but he was devoted to your mother.

598
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:10,717
I suppose I may continue to rely
on your professional discretion?

599
01:07:14,536 --> 01:07:18,759
You mean, will I tell anyone the truth
about that girl?

600
01:07:19,594 --> 01:07:21,317
That's what I mean, yes.

601
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:27,266
You may continue to rely
on my professional etcetera.

602
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:29,886
You are fastidious, aren't you?

603
01:07:31,177 --> 01:07:34,593
What happens to a girl like that,
when a man like you is finished with her?

604
01:07:35,882 --> 01:07:37,092
Interested?

605
01:07:38,122 --> 01:07:39,431
I give her to you.

606
01:07:42,602 --> 01:07:45,089
You shouldn't smoke. You've had a shock.

607
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:54,369
I give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.

608
01:07:55,465 --> 01:07:56,872
A wedding present.

609
01:09:07,434 --> 01:09:09,408
Where have you seen that girl before?

610
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:12,162
What makes you think
I've seen her before?

611
01:09:12,234 --> 01:09:13,444
Haven't you?

612
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,036
- Yes.
- Where?

613
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:19,718
I'm not supposed to say.
It was on a case. Not very nice.

614
01:09:19,883 --> 01:09:22,600
No, don't tell me,
if you're not supposed to say.

615
01:10:01,002 --> 01:10:04,351
In bourgeols terms It was a war
between the Allles and Germany.

616
01:10:04,907 --> 01:10:09,031
In Bolshevlk terms It was a war between
the Allled and the German upper classes.

617
01:10:09,451 --> 01:10:12,550
And, whlch of them won was
a matter ofIndlfference.

618
01:10:29,034 --> 01:10:33,540
I was ordered by the Party to enllst.
I gave my name as Petrov.

619
01:10:34,346 --> 01:10:36,768
They were shoutlng for vlctory
all over Europe...

620
01:10:36,843 --> 01:10:39,461
...praylng for vlctory, to the same God.

621
01:10:40,267 --> 01:10:44,708
My task, the Party's task,
was to organlze defeat.

622
01:10:45,419 --> 01:10:47,785
From defeat would sprlng the Revolutlon.

623
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:50,501
And, the Revolutlon would be
vlctory for us.

624
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:53,824
The Party looked
to the conscrlpt peasants...

625
01:10:54,186 --> 01:10:57,034
...most of them wearlng
thelr flrst good palr ofboots.

626
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:00,234
When the boots wore out,
they'd be ready to llsten.

627
01:11:00,587 --> 01:11:04,383
When the tlme came, I was able to take
3 battallons wlth me out of the Front Llne.

628
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:06,597
The best day's work I ever dld.

629
01:11:07,146 --> 01:11:09,797
But, for the moment,
there was nothlng to be done.

630
01:11:09,866 --> 01:11:12,517
There were too many volunteers llke me.

631
01:11:12,938 --> 01:11:14,945
Mostly, It was mere hysterla.

632
01:11:15,274 --> 01:11:18,853
But there were men wlth better motlves,
men who saw the tlmes were crltlcal...

633
01:11:18,923 --> 01:11:20,679
...and wanted a man's part.

634
01:11:20,905 --> 01:11:22,432
Good men, wasted.

635
01:11:23,371 --> 01:11:24,865
Unhappy men, too.

636
01:11:25,258 --> 01:11:27,047
Unhappy In thelr jobs.

637
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:29,674
Unhappy wlth thelr wlves.

638
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:31,941
Doubtlng themselves.

639
01:11:32,811 --> 01:11:34,699
Happy men don't volunteer.

640
01:11:35,371 --> 01:11:39,298
They walt thelr turn and thank God
If thelr age, or work, delays It.

641
01:11:40,330 --> 01:11:44,160
The ones who got back home wlth
the prlce of an arm or an eye or a leg...

642
01:11:45,355 --> 01:11:47,592
...these were the lucky ones.

643
01:11:52,619 --> 01:11:54,081
Even Comrade Lenln...

644
01:11:54,474 --> 01:11:58,664
...underestlmated both
the angulsh of that 900- mlle- long front...

645
01:11:59,466 --> 01:12:01,954
...and our cursed capaclty for sufferlng.

646
01:12:04,682 --> 01:12:07,301
By the second wInter of the war...

647
01:12:07,787 --> 01:12:09,674
...the boots had worn out...

648
01:12:10,955 --> 01:12:12,646
...but the llne stlll held.

649
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:16,490
Thelr great coats fell to pleces
on thelr backs.

650
01:12:17,483 --> 01:12:19,491
Thelr ratlons were Irregular.

651
01:12:20,427 --> 01:12:22,980
Half of them went lnto actlon
wlthout arms...

652
01:12:23,371 --> 01:12:25,281
...led by men they dldn't trust.

653
01:12:25,355 --> 01:12:27,527
Come on, you bastards!

654
01:12:29,003 --> 01:12:30,628
And, those they dld trust--

655
01:12:30,698 --> 01:12:32,641
Come on, Comrades. Come on!

656
01:12:33,451 --> 01:12:34,433
Come on!

657
01:12:44,075 --> 01:12:45,448
Come on!

658
01:12:47,851 --> 01:12:48,963
Come on!

659
01:12:49,419 --> 01:12:52,004
Comrades! Earthshakers!

660
01:12:52,266 --> 01:12:54,274
Show them!

661
01:12:56,395 --> 01:12:58,337
Charge!

662
01:13:18,923 --> 01:13:23,047
At last they dld what all the armles
dreamed of dolng:

663
01:13:24,043 --> 01:13:25,952
They began to go home.

664
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:38,498
That was the beglnnlng of the Revolutlon.

665
01:14:02,508 --> 01:14:03,937
Deserters.

666
01:14:04,363 --> 01:14:05,792
Replacements.

667
01:14:18,027 --> 01:14:21,376
Tote arms!

668
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:29,924
Come back.

669
01:14:31,147 --> 01:14:32,805
Stick together!

670
01:14:35,787 --> 01:14:37,991
Stick together and we'll be all right.

671
01:14:39,117 --> 01:14:40,775
And be ready for them.

672
01:15:05,419 --> 01:15:06,729
Turn around, lads!

673
01:15:06,988 --> 01:15:09,409
- Don't go any farther.
- Come on, lads. Turn around.

674
01:15:09,484 --> 01:15:11,721
Pigs to the slaughter! Look at you!

675
01:15:11,948 --> 01:15:13,377
Turn around, lads.

676
01:15:34,444 --> 01:15:35,654
Listen, lads.

677
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:38,762
Ten miles up that road are the Germans!

678
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:42,248
- Rubbish.
- Not rubbish.

679
01:15:42,348 --> 01:15:45,217
They're coming. And they're coming fast.

680
01:15:46,156 --> 01:15:47,683
You've let them in.

681
01:15:49,900 --> 01:15:51,809
They're coming for your wives...

682
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,151
...your houses, your country.

683
01:15:54,284 --> 01:15:56,618
Your country, Officer!

684
01:15:57,387 --> 01:16:00,289
Yes, my country! And proud--

685
01:16:14,764 --> 01:16:16,390
Get back in your ranks!

686
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:18,756
Get back in your ranks!

687
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:25,739
Get back!

688
01:16:28,524 --> 01:16:30,596
Get back in the ranks!

689
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:44,841
Are you a nurse?

690
01:17:45,644 --> 01:17:46,537
Yes.

691
01:17:46,635 --> 01:17:48,228
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

692
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,282
Then help me.

693
01:18:17,261 --> 01:18:20,489
Doctor, I ought to tell you,
I'm not a trained nurse, I'm a volunteer.

694
01:18:20,556 --> 01:18:21,701
I see. Right.

695
01:18:22,604 --> 01:18:24,130
Why did you volunteer?

696
01:18:24,812 --> 01:18:27,627
- I came here to find my husband.
- Very gently.

697
01:18:28,045 --> 01:18:30,314
- Have you ever seen an operation?
- Yes.

698
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:31,687
We'll manage.

699
01:18:43,757 --> 01:18:47,106
They're in the next village, brothers.
The Germans.

700
01:18:48,301 --> 01:18:49,927
- Your Honor--
- Keep still.

701
01:19:18,765 --> 01:19:20,619
Did you find your husband?

702
01:19:21,997 --> 01:19:22,945
No.

703
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:24,329
Your Honor...

704
01:19:24,461 --> 01:19:26,054
Yes, we'd better be off.

705
01:19:41,806 --> 01:19:44,619
You know, you often look at me
as though you knew me.

706
01:19:44,812 --> 01:19:47,846
I have seen you.
Four years ago. Christmas Eve.

707
01:19:50,125 --> 01:19:51,619
Were you there?

708
01:19:52,525 --> 01:19:54,151
No wonder you look at me.

709
01:19:56,045 --> 01:19:57,955
Did you know Victor Komarovsky?

710
01:19:58,573 --> 01:20:01,638
Yes, I did. That young man,
who took you away--

711
01:20:01,740 --> 01:20:02,601
My husband.

712
01:20:02,668 --> 01:20:05,702
A lot of courage.
He made the rest of us look very feeble.

713
01:20:05,772 --> 01:20:08,292
As a matter of fact, I thought you both did.

714
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:10,279
Good man to shoot at.

715
01:20:11,277 --> 01:20:13,579
I'd give anything never to have met him.

716
01:20:42,606 --> 01:20:44,231
The tsar's in prison.

717
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,587
Lenin's in Moscow.

718
01:20:49,006 --> 01:20:50,695
Civil war has started.

719
01:20:51,085 --> 01:20:52,012
Good!

720
01:20:52,076 --> 01:20:53,571
Civil war, good?

721
01:20:54,444 --> 01:20:56,550
Not good, Comrade Nurse, inevitable.

722
01:20:58,124 --> 01:21:00,994
But Lenin in Moscow!

723
01:21:01,645 --> 01:21:04,994
This Lenin, will he be the new tsar then?

724
01:21:06,061 --> 01:21:09,356
Listen, Daddy.
No more tsars, no more masters.

725
01:21:09,645 --> 01:21:12,907
Only workers in a worker's state.
How about that?

726
01:21:14,189 --> 01:21:15,618
Are you a doctor?

727
01:21:15,821 --> 01:21:17,447
- Yes.
- Follow me, please.

728
01:22:02,382 --> 01:22:04,237
I can't deal with this.

729
01:22:04,750 --> 01:22:08,099
Order of the Provisional Government.
You'll have to try, friend.

730
01:22:15,917 --> 01:22:18,471
"If you could see how hard
we have been working here...

731
01:22:18,541 --> 01:22:21,858
"...I feel sure you'd forgive me, dear,
for not writing more regularly."

732
01:22:21,934 --> 01:22:23,243
When was that written?

733
01:22:23,342 --> 01:22:24,552
July 20th.

734
01:22:24,621 --> 01:22:25,734
Eight weeks!

735
01:22:26,286 --> 01:22:28,872
"But now the war seems
really to have stopped.

736
01:22:28,942 --> 01:22:32,072
"The hospital is emptying,
and I shall have more time.

737
01:22:32,173 --> 01:22:36,330
"I may even get time to write some verse,
if I've not forgotten how to."

738
01:22:36,909 --> 01:22:38,316
Oh, I do hope so!

739
01:22:40,493 --> 01:22:43,908
"Larissa Antipova is still here,
and I admire her more and more.

740
01:22:45,582 --> 01:22:49,772
"She seems to have the strange gift
of healing, which doctors don't believe in.

741
01:22:50,478 --> 01:22:54,253
"She often does the wrong things,
but it always seems to work out right.

742
01:22:55,822 --> 01:22:57,229
"How is Uncle Alex?

743
01:22:57,390 --> 01:23:00,652
- "Can he still get his English tobacco?"
- Would that he could!

744
01:23:00,718 --> 01:23:03,752
"Can Sasha say his letters yet?
And how is Auntie Anna?"

745
01:23:05,293 --> 01:23:07,082
He didn't get my letter.

746
01:23:08,206 --> 01:23:10,595
"Most of all, my dearest, how are you?"

747
01:23:11,182 --> 01:23:13,735
Strangely upsetting.
He doesn't know she's dead.

748
01:23:14,958 --> 01:23:16,998
Can't see what difference it makes.

749
01:23:18,318 --> 01:23:19,725
They're at it again!

750
01:23:20,398 --> 01:23:22,786
I wish they'd decide once and for all...

751
01:23:23,373 --> 01:23:27,945
...which gang of hooligans constitutes
the government of this country!

752
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,917
Cheer up, Sergei.

753
01:23:36,751 --> 01:23:38,408
Don't you want to go home?

754
01:23:39,149 --> 01:23:41,899
There's fighting at home, Your Honor.
I've had enough.

755
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:46,307
Red Guards and White Guards,
this old man's had enough.

756
01:23:47,726 --> 01:23:49,636
Your Honor is a kind gentleman.

757
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:54,441
And, the nurse is a kind lady.

758
01:24:08,846 --> 01:24:09,959
Finished?

759
01:24:10,190 --> 01:24:11,466
Just about.

760
01:24:20,077 --> 01:24:22,630
In a couple of weeks
you'll be with your little girl.

761
01:24:22,701 --> 01:24:24,295
If I can get on a train.

762
01:24:27,183 --> 01:24:30,216
I want to be with Katya
more than anything in the world.

763
01:24:30,478 --> 01:24:31,689
Yes, of course.

764
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:35,338
But, now that we're going, I feel sad.

765
01:24:37,422 --> 01:24:38,371
Sad.

766
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:40,710
Really sad.

767
01:24:41,327 --> 01:24:43,563
- Well, we've been here some time.
- Yes.

768
01:24:46,126 --> 01:24:48,515
This must have been a lovely house, once.

769
01:24:49,422 --> 01:24:50,535
Don't you think?

770
01:24:50,606 --> 01:24:52,297
What are you going to do?

771
01:24:52,974 --> 01:24:54,021
In Gradov?

772
01:24:54,094 --> 01:24:55,042
Yes.

773
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:57,286
I'll be all right.

774
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:58,952
I wish I could think so.

775
01:25:04,622 --> 01:25:06,215
You could run a laundry.

776
01:25:07,821 --> 01:25:09,250
What will you do?

777
01:25:09,358 --> 01:25:11,594
I suppose I'll go back to the hospital.

778
01:25:12,622 --> 01:25:14,630
It's funny to think of you there.

779
01:25:18,382 --> 01:25:20,618
I used to pass it on my way to school.

780
01:25:21,902 --> 01:25:23,812
Do you ever come to Moscow?

781
01:25:24,046 --> 01:25:25,159
From Gradov?

782
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:28,614
If only there were someone
to look after you.

783
01:25:28,687 --> 01:25:31,884
Of course, if there were,
I'd be destroyed by jealousy.

784
01:25:31,982 --> 01:25:33,292
Zhivago, don't.

785
01:25:37,326 --> 01:25:39,945
My dear, don't, please!

786
01:25:45,614 --> 01:25:47,621
Now, look what you've made me do.

787
01:25:54,926 --> 01:25:58,122
We've been together six months,
on the road and here...

788
01:25:59,246 --> 01:26:02,760
...and we've not done anything
you'll have to lie about to Tonya.

789
01:26:03,919 --> 01:26:06,308
I don't want you to have to lie about me.

790
01:26:07,503 --> 01:26:09,128
You understand that, Yuri?

791
01:26:12,462 --> 01:26:14,088
You understand everything.

792
01:26:23,887 --> 01:26:25,959
Come on, Comrades! I'm in a hurry.

793
01:26:26,542 --> 01:26:27,971
Going home, Kuril?

794
01:26:28,238 --> 01:26:29,733
Home, Your Excellency?

795
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:32,236
Petrograd. I'm joining the Red Guard.

796
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:33,828
What about your wife?

797
01:26:34,574 --> 01:26:37,029
Sometimes, Comrade Nurse,
women have to wait.

798
01:26:37,903 --> 01:26:38,852
Right!

799
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:40,745
Goodbye, honored Doctor.

800
01:26:41,838 --> 01:26:43,180
Want some advice?

801
01:26:43,278 --> 01:26:45,995
- Said the millstone to the barley.
- That's right.

802
01:26:46,062 --> 01:26:47,272
Adapt yourself!

803
01:26:55,088 --> 01:26:56,364
Goodbye, Durinev.

804
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:58,021
Goodbye, Your Honor.

805
01:26:59,438 --> 01:27:00,813
Goodbye, Andr.

806
01:27:01,839 --> 01:27:03,115
Goodbye, Simyon.

807
01:27:06,607 --> 01:27:08,430
I'll never forget Your Honor.

808
01:27:09,295 --> 01:27:10,277
Never!

809
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:13,003
Goodbye, Zhivago.

810
01:27:14,894 --> 01:27:16,323
Goodbye. Thank you.

811
01:27:19,822 --> 01:27:20,771
Pilenko.

812
01:27:57,807 --> 01:27:59,912
Goodbye, brothers!

813
01:28:43,695 --> 01:28:45,321
The doctor is a gentleman.

814
01:28:45,647 --> 01:28:47,141
Right. Written all over him.

815
01:28:47,215 --> 01:28:48,841
He's a good man.

816
01:28:49,199 --> 01:28:50,661
God rot good men.

817
01:29:07,055 --> 01:29:08,038
Yuri!

818
01:29:38,672 --> 01:29:42,021
This is Comrade Yelkin,
our local delegate. He lives here.

819
01:29:43,855 --> 01:29:45,033
How do you do?

820
01:29:45,903 --> 01:29:46,885
Welcome.

821
01:29:47,823 --> 01:29:49,252
Comrade Kaprugina--

822
01:29:49,455 --> 01:29:50,251
Welcome.

823
01:29:50,319 --> 01:29:52,490
It's not for you to welcome us, Comrade.

824
01:29:52,559 --> 01:29:56,171
Comrade Kaprugina is the chairman
of the Residents' Committee.

825
01:29:56,911 --> 01:29:59,181
- Yes, of course.
- Your discharge papers?

826
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,582
Oh, yes.

827
01:30:02,223 --> 01:30:04,197
I signed them myself, I'm afraid.

828
01:30:09,936 --> 01:30:11,048
Holy Cross?

829
01:30:11,792 --> 01:30:12,806
What?

830
01:30:13,072 --> 01:30:16,421
- Holy Cross Hospital. It's on--
- The Second Reformed Hospital.

831
01:30:18,895 --> 01:30:20,652
Good. It needed reforming.

832
01:30:26,351 --> 01:30:29,068
Medicals report
to their place of work at once.

833
01:30:29,264 --> 01:30:31,174
Yes. I believe there's typhus?

834
01:30:32,911 --> 01:30:35,399
You've been listening
to rumormongers, Comrade.

835
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:37,381
There is no typhus in our city.

836
01:30:38,287 --> 01:30:41,037
Well, that's good news.
I'll report tomorrow.

837
01:30:41,583 --> 01:30:44,301
When you've started work,
you'll get a ration book.

838
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,479
I've always worked.

839
01:30:52,048 --> 01:30:53,641
Whatever is the matter?

840
01:30:54,000 --> 01:30:54,948
You are.

841
01:30:57,936 --> 01:31:01,929
There was living space for 13 families
in this one house.

842
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:08,357
Yes. This is a better arrangement,
Comrades.

843
01:31:08,752 --> 01:31:09,766
More just.

844
01:31:17,456 --> 01:31:20,805
Well, it is more just, Tonya.
Why did it sound so funny?

845
01:31:30,637 --> 01:31:32,164
Is it good to be home?

846
01:31:41,739 --> 01:31:42,689
Sasha?

847
01:31:42,796 --> 01:31:43,908
Who else?

848
01:31:46,444 --> 01:31:47,938
It's your daddy, Sasha.

849
01:31:48,012 --> 01:31:48,960
Sasha!

850
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:51,519
Sasha!

851
01:31:53,067 --> 01:31:54,015
Naughty boy!

852
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:55,520
No, don't say that.

853
01:31:57,514 --> 01:31:58,791
May I come in?

854
01:32:01,386 --> 01:32:02,761
Watch carefully.

855
01:32:03,691 --> 01:32:07,367
I am about to ignite the last half
of the last cigar in Moscow.

856
01:32:09,993 --> 01:32:11,106
Good meal?

857
01:32:11,370 --> 01:32:13,060
- Very.
- Say something.

858
01:32:15,337 --> 01:32:17,028
That was very good, Tonya.

859
01:32:17,129 --> 01:32:18,144
That was nothing.

860
01:32:18,217 --> 01:32:20,453
She's been saving that salami
for three months.

861
01:32:20,521 --> 01:32:21,568
Have you, darling?

862
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,917
I got it for a clock.

863
01:32:23,785 --> 01:32:26,337
She's a marvel. Coffee, you observe.

864
01:32:26,729 --> 01:32:29,347
Stop it, Daddy. He knows I'm a marvel.

865
01:32:30,888 --> 01:32:32,316
Did you write any poetry?

866
01:32:32,392 --> 01:32:33,603
Quite a lot.

867
01:32:34,056 --> 01:32:35,104
Is it good?

868
01:32:36,168 --> 01:32:37,923
Yes, I think so.

869
01:32:38,823 --> 01:32:39,969
Can I see it?

870
01:32:40,711 --> 01:32:42,140
Well, of course.

871
01:32:43,847 --> 01:32:47,524
What happened to Nurse Antipova?
Your letters were full of her.

872
01:32:48,455 --> 01:32:50,081
Yes, I suppose they were.

873
01:32:51,079 --> 01:32:53,947
That's the girl who shot
friend Komarovsky, isn't it?

874
01:32:54,151 --> 01:32:55,906
Yes, Daddy. You know it is.

875
01:32:56,262 --> 01:32:58,334
She's gone home to her little girl.

876
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:01,275
- Oh, we shan't see her then?
- No.

877
01:33:02,245 --> 01:33:03,358
What a pity!

878
01:33:11,749 --> 01:33:13,921
Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.

879
01:33:15,364 --> 01:33:19,041
What I don't understand is
how we're going to stay alive this winter.

880
01:33:23,908 --> 01:33:26,176
You have no right whatever
to call me from work.

881
01:33:26,243 --> 01:33:27,618
As a Soviet deputy, I--

882
01:33:27,683 --> 01:33:29,985
That gives you the power, not the right.

883
01:33:30,243 --> 01:33:33,276
It's noticed, you know.
Your attitude is noticed.

884
01:33:33,475 --> 01:33:36,028
You should have called the area doctor.

885
01:33:36,290 --> 01:33:38,146
I want this done quietly.

886
01:33:38,562 --> 01:33:40,472
Why, what is it, typhus?

887
01:33:50,273 --> 01:33:52,826
I'll take him away. Get me some transport.

888
01:33:53,345 --> 01:33:54,839
It isn't typhus.

889
01:33:55,585 --> 01:33:58,618
It's another disease
we don't have in Moscow: starvation.

890
01:33:59,040 --> 01:34:00,829
That seems to give you satisfaction.

891
01:34:00,897 --> 01:34:03,101
It would give me satisfaction
to hear you admit it.

892
01:34:03,169 --> 01:34:05,438
- Would it? Why?
- Because it is so.

893
01:34:06,912 --> 01:34:10,294
Your attitude is noticed, you know.
Oh, yes, it's been noticed.

894
01:34:14,655 --> 01:34:15,604
Hello.

895
01:34:20,158 --> 01:34:21,435
The stove's out!

896
01:34:25,982 --> 01:34:27,259
The stove's out!

897
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:31,156
What's the matter with you?
No wonder he's losing weight!

898
01:34:39,293 --> 01:34:43,604
She lets it out as soon as you've gone,
and she lights it before you come home.

899
01:34:56,572 --> 01:34:58,165
We haven't enough fuel.

900
01:35:16,570 --> 01:35:21,655
I told myselflt was beneath my dlgnlty
to arrest a man for pllferlng flrewood.

901
01:35:24,346 --> 01:35:27,510
But nothlng ordered by the Party
Is beneath the dlgnlty of any man...

902
01:35:27,578 --> 01:35:28,984
...and the Party was rlght.

903
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:32,079
One man desperate for a blt of fuel
Is pathetlc.

904
01:35:32,408 --> 01:35:35,792
Flve mllllon people desperate for fuel
wlll destroy a clty.

905
01:35:36,921 --> 01:35:39,506
That was the flrst tlme
I ever saw my brother.

906
01:35:39,577 --> 01:35:43,635
But, I knew hlm,
and I knew that I would dlsobey the Party.

907
01:35:44,504 --> 01:35:47,701
Perhaps It was the tle ofblood
between us, but I doubt It.

908
01:35:47,992 --> 01:35:51,537
We were only half-tled, anyway,
and brothers wlll betray a brother.

909
01:35:51,768 --> 01:35:54,833
Indeed, as a pollceman, I would say
"Get hold of a man's brother...

910
01:35:54,904 --> 01:35:56,496
"...and you're half way home. "

911
01:35:57,047 --> 01:35:59,829
Nor was It admlratlon
for a better man than me.

912
01:36:00,727 --> 01:36:04,240
I dld admlre hlm, but I dldn't thlnk
he was a better man.

913
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:08,139
Besldes, I've executed better men than me
wlth a small plstol.

914
01:36:39,220 --> 01:36:41,903
Now you'll have to live
like the rest of us, Doctor.

915
01:36:41,972 --> 01:36:44,045
Bring that! Bring that back!

916
01:36:44,115 --> 01:36:46,537
Oh, listen to His Excellency!

917
01:36:48,435 --> 01:36:49,897
I want no anarchy!

918
01:36:50,707 --> 01:36:52,714
I want this carried out correctly.

919
01:36:55,795 --> 01:36:56,907
What are you doing?

920
01:36:56,978 --> 01:36:58,986
Re-allocation of living space,
Comrade Doctor.

921
01:36:59,058 --> 01:37:01,807
Fifty square meters
for a family of less than five persons.

922
01:37:01,874 --> 01:37:03,882
Dammit, whose house is this, anyway?

923
01:37:04,146 --> 01:37:05,575
Father, be quiet!

924
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:08,966
All right, 50 square meters.
What're you doing with my things?

925
01:37:09,042 --> 01:37:10,219
They're being stored.

926
01:37:10,289 --> 01:37:11,718
They're being stolen.

927
01:37:12,752 --> 01:37:13,997
Just a minute!

928
01:37:23,536 --> 01:37:25,227
And where did you get this?

929
01:37:25,392 --> 01:37:27,279
I pulled it out of a fence.

930
01:37:54,062 --> 01:37:55,949
I told them who I was.

931
01:37:56,301 --> 01:38:00,097
The old man was hostlle, the glrl cautlous.

932
01:38:01,005 --> 01:38:02,150
My brother...

933
01:38:04,076 --> 01:38:05,603
...seemed very pleased.

934
01:38:09,389 --> 01:38:12,737
I think the girl was the only one
who guessed at thelr position.

935
01:38:14,412 --> 01:38:17,707
You're just as I imagined you.
You're my political conscience.

936
01:38:17,804 --> 01:38:19,942
I asked hlm hadn't he one of hls own.

937
01:38:20,204 --> 01:38:22,407
And so he talked about the Revolutlon.

938
01:38:22,475 --> 01:38:26,731
You lay life on a table and you cut out
all the tumors of injustice. Marvelous.

939
01:38:26,796 --> 01:38:29,893
I told hlm If he felt llke that
he shouldjoln the Party.

940
01:38:30,315 --> 01:38:33,631
Cutting out the tumors of injustice,
that's a deep operation.

941
01:38:33,898 --> 01:38:36,037
Someone must keep life alive
while you do it.

942
01:38:36,106 --> 01:38:37,283
By living.

943
01:38:37,738 --> 01:38:39,014
Isn't that right?

944
01:38:39,082 --> 01:38:41,122
I thought then It was wrong.

945
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:45,217
He told me what he thought
about the Party and I trembled for hlm.

946
01:38:45,322 --> 01:38:49,696
He approved of us, but for reasons
whlch were subtle, llke hls verse.

947
01:38:50,345 --> 01:38:52,866
Approval such as hls
could vanlsh overnlght.

948
01:38:52,936 --> 01:38:53,951
I told hlm so.

949
01:38:54,025 --> 01:38:57,341
Of course, I can't approve this evening
something you may do tomorrow.

950
01:38:57,417 --> 01:39:01,475
He was walklng about wlth a noose
round hls neck and dldn't know.

951
01:39:01,992 --> 01:39:05,669
So I told hlm what I had heard
about hls poems.

952
01:39:07,528 --> 01:39:08,772
Not liked?

953
01:39:09,864 --> 01:39:11,270
Not liked by whom?

954
01:39:12,711 --> 01:39:13,889
Why not liked?

955
01:39:13,959 --> 01:39:15,485
So I told hlm that.

956
01:39:24,550 --> 01:39:28,325
Do you think it's "personal,
petit-bourgeois and self indulgent"?

957
01:39:29,702 --> 01:39:30,717
I lled.

958
01:39:31,398 --> 01:39:32,958
But he belleved me.

959
01:39:33,638 --> 01:39:36,933
And It struck me through to see
that my oplnlon mattered.

960
01:39:38,629 --> 01:39:41,247
The glrl knew what It meant,
what It was golng to mean.

961
01:39:41,317 --> 01:39:44,252
They couldn't survlve
what was comlng In the clty.

962
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:47,423
I urged them to leave and llve obscurely
somewhere In the country...

963
01:39:47,492 --> 01:39:49,564
...where they could keep themselves allve.

964
01:39:49,637 --> 01:39:53,117
We have, used to have,
an estate at Varykino, near Yuriatin.

965
01:39:55,461 --> 01:39:57,347
The people know us there.

966
01:39:57,636 --> 01:39:58,913
He dldn't reslst.

967
01:39:59,204 --> 01:40:02,139
I offered to obtaln permlts,
passes, warrants...

968
01:40:02,467 --> 01:40:05,314
...told them what to take
and what to leave behInd.

969
01:40:08,771 --> 01:40:12,032
I had the Impertlnence to ask hlm
for a volume of hls poems.

970
01:40:13,314 --> 01:40:14,841
And so we parted.

971
01:40:15,170 --> 01:40:18,585
I thlnk I even told hlm
that we would meet agaln In better tlmes.

972
01:40:19,202 --> 01:40:20,827
But perhaps I dldn't.

973
01:42:14,553 --> 01:42:15,829
Fifty persons!

974
01:42:15,961 --> 01:42:17,390
Fifty persons only!

975
01:42:17,560 --> 01:42:18,836
Fifty persons!

976
01:42:22,424 --> 01:42:23,634
Tonya, here!

977
01:42:23,736 --> 01:42:25,808
Fifty persons only!

978
01:42:26,135 --> 01:42:27,248
Get back!

979
01:42:29,623 --> 01:42:31,412
Fifty persons only!

980
01:42:31,799 --> 01:42:33,424
Fifty persons!

981
01:42:34,678 --> 01:42:36,085
Fifty persons!

982
01:42:36,215 --> 01:42:38,516
Only 50 persons!

983
01:42:50,806 --> 01:42:52,464
Charming accommodation.

984
01:42:52,693 --> 01:42:54,482
Charming accommodation.

985
01:42:55,157 --> 01:42:56,466
That's very good.

986
01:42:56,949 --> 01:42:58,356
I'm an intellectual.

987
01:42:58,421 --> 01:43:00,941
Shut up, you "intellectual."

988
01:43:02,612 --> 01:43:04,270
Shut up, you lickspittle.

989
01:43:11,444 --> 01:43:12,393
Forced labor.

990
01:43:22,931 --> 01:43:24,359
Attention, Comrades.

991
01:43:24,499 --> 01:43:26,767
Your train will leave tomorrow morning.

992
01:43:26,995 --> 01:43:29,035
Health regulations for the journey:

993
01:43:29,458 --> 01:43:32,077
Night soil will be emptied
every morning without fail.

994
01:43:32,147 --> 01:43:35,855
Straw to be replaced at ten day intervals
and the old straw burned.

995
01:43:36,017 --> 01:43:39,563
In the event of fresh straw
being unavailable, old straw to be turned.

996
01:43:40,498 --> 01:43:42,353
This is disinfectant. Use it.

997
01:43:44,305 --> 01:43:46,639
In this wagon is a detachment
of Voluntary Labor.

998
01:43:46,705 --> 01:43:47,687
Liar.

999
01:43:52,592 --> 01:43:55,854
You are required by Military Committee
to show them all assistance.

1000
01:43:55,952 --> 01:43:59,814
One carriage is occupied by sailors
of the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet.

1001
01:44:01,583 --> 01:44:02,991
So you'll be in good hands.

1002
01:44:03,056 --> 01:44:04,299
They're idiots.

1003
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:07,566
Attention, Comrades.

1004
01:44:07,984 --> 01:44:11,399
In approximately 11 days' time
you'll pass through the Urals province...

1005
01:44:11,470 --> 01:44:14,438
...where White Guard units,
aided by foreign interventionists...

1006
01:44:14,511 --> 01:44:17,859
...and other criminal reactionary elements,
have recently been active.

1007
01:44:18,575 --> 01:44:20,549
The Military Committee assures you...

1008
01:44:20,718 --> 01:44:23,718
...that the criminals have been
completely routed in that area...

1009
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:27,533
...by Red Guard units under the command
of People's Commander Strelnikov.

1010
01:44:29,422 --> 01:44:30,599
There's a man.

1011
01:44:31,085 --> 01:44:32,067
Clap him.

1012
01:44:33,965 --> 01:44:36,169
The line is definitely clear.

1013
01:44:36,845 --> 01:44:38,219
Long live the Revolution!

1014
01:44:38,285 --> 01:44:39,594
Long live anarchy!

1015
01:44:39,884 --> 01:44:42,023
Lickspittle! Bureaucrat!

1016
01:44:51,243 --> 01:44:52,618
Is that necessary?

1017
01:44:53,675 --> 01:44:57,188
Six volunteers I've signed for,
and six I'll deliver.

1018
01:44:58,635 --> 01:45:00,937
I'm a free man, lickspittle.

1019
01:45:01,931 --> 01:45:04,103
There's nothing you can do about it.

1020
01:45:09,802 --> 01:45:12,223
I'm the only free man on this train.

1021
01:45:13,450 --> 01:45:15,272
The rest of you are cattle.

1022
01:50:15,154 --> 01:50:17,455
Help me, brothers, for the love of God.

1023
01:50:32,720 --> 01:50:34,280
Come on!

1024
01:50:53,166 --> 01:50:55,022
Yuri, the child is dead.

1025
01:51:04,430 --> 01:51:06,218
It wasn't my child, dear...

1026
01:51:06,477 --> 01:51:09,412
...and his little soul's in Heaven now,
that's certain.

1027
01:51:10,893 --> 01:51:12,998
Who did it, Comrade, the Whites?

1028
01:51:13,453 --> 01:51:14,565
The Whites?

1029
01:51:16,685 --> 01:51:18,506
No, Strelnikov.

1030
01:51:20,204 --> 01:51:22,625
Well, then, you must have done something.

1031
01:51:23,244 --> 01:51:24,967
It wasn't us, Comrade.

1032
01:51:25,228 --> 01:51:27,595
The commander said
we'd sold horses to the Whites.

1033
01:51:27,660 --> 01:51:29,864
It wasn't us, it was those pigs in Kuniko.

1034
01:51:29,996 --> 01:51:31,883
We told him, but he didn't believe us.

1035
01:51:31,947 --> 01:51:33,573
I expect you were lying.

1036
01:51:33,642 --> 01:51:35,715
- As God's my witness.
- But he isn't.

1037
01:51:37,675 --> 01:51:39,748
Commander Strelnikov is a great man.

1038
01:51:41,354 --> 01:51:44,737
A commander, Sasha,
and he lives on bread and water.

1039
01:51:45,322 --> 01:51:46,336
Does he?

1040
01:51:47,211 --> 01:51:48,617
I don't know. They say so.

1041
01:51:48,682 --> 01:51:49,630
It's true.

1042
01:51:49,707 --> 01:51:51,681
No one knows where he comes from.

1043
01:51:52,169 --> 01:51:54,079
And they never know where he is.

1044
01:51:54,217 --> 01:51:56,356
- He's back up the line.
- Yes?

1045
01:51:59,273 --> 01:52:00,647
Someone's for it.

1046
01:52:03,113 --> 01:52:04,738
Oh, really, not again!

1047
01:52:06,279 --> 01:52:07,556
What this time?

1048
01:52:17,384 --> 01:52:19,937
Never mind, Father.
Get a good night's sleep.

1049
01:52:24,935 --> 01:52:26,658
I know what I'm going to do.

1050
01:52:48,485 --> 01:52:49,467
Look!

1051
01:52:50,597 --> 01:52:51,774
The Urals.

1052
01:52:53,573 --> 01:52:56,441
Look, Sasha, look.
That's where we're going, darling.

1053
01:52:56,772 --> 01:52:59,161
Through the mountains and into the forest.

1054
01:52:59,396 --> 01:53:01,305
Then it'll be much warmer still.

1055
01:53:02,500 --> 01:53:04,889
Will there be wolves in the forest?

1056
01:53:28,674 --> 01:53:30,201
Strelnikov!

1057
01:53:37,953 --> 01:53:39,382
That's Strelnikov.

1058
01:58:19,427 --> 01:58:20,425
Daddy!

1059
01:58:23,427 --> 01:58:24,903
What's that noise?

1060
01:58:26,113 --> 01:58:27,704
It's only a waterfall.

1061
01:58:27,906 --> 01:58:29,343
No, the other noise.

1062
01:58:33,507 --> 01:58:34,745
Guns, Sasha.

1063
01:58:35,588 --> 01:58:36,990
Are they fighting?

1064
01:58:37,190 --> 01:58:39,665
They must be. It's a long way away.

1065
01:58:40,345 --> 01:58:41,630
Let's go to sleep.

1066
01:59:29,984 --> 01:59:31,029
Get him!

1067
01:59:37,187 --> 01:59:38,271
Look!

1068
01:59:46,345 --> 01:59:47,430
Is that all?

1069
01:59:47,507 --> 01:59:48,790
That's all.

1070
01:59:56,588 --> 01:59:57,863
Bring him.

1071
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:11,711
Who sent you here, Zhivago?

1072
02:00:12,142 --> 02:00:14,185
No one sent me here, Commander.

1073
02:00:14,310 --> 02:00:16,467
I'm going to Yuriatin
with my wife and child.

1074
02:00:16,544 --> 02:00:18,225
They're on the train from Moscow.

1075
02:00:18,312 --> 02:00:19,864
Yes, we've checked that.

1076
02:00:20,391 --> 02:00:20,987
Then?

1077
02:00:21,072 --> 02:00:24,745
You put your knife with a fork and a spoon
and it looks quite innocuous.

1078
02:00:24,831 --> 02:00:28,150
Perhaps you travel with a wife and child
for the same reason?

1079
02:00:30,192 --> 02:00:31,151
No.

1080
02:00:31,429 --> 02:00:35,264
Yuriatin is occupied by White Guards.
Is that why you're going there?

1081
02:00:35,744 --> 02:00:38,189
No. We're going on to Varykino.

1082
02:00:38,543 --> 02:00:41,069
Not through Yuriatin. It's under shellfire.

1083
02:00:41,585 --> 02:00:43,667
Commander, I'm not a White agent.

1084
02:00:45,104 --> 02:00:46,830
No, I don't think you are.

1085
02:00:47,071 --> 02:00:49,910
All right, Kolya. Thank you, Comrades.
Sit down, Doctor.

1086
02:00:49,986 --> 02:00:50,906
Take it.

1087
02:00:52,469 --> 02:00:55,990
It's not as silly as it seems.
There have been one or two attempts.

1088
02:01:01,591 --> 02:01:02,868
Are you the poet?

1089
02:01:03,623 --> 02:01:04,583
Yes.

1090
02:01:04,948 --> 02:01:06,788
I used to admire your poetry.

1091
02:01:06,865 --> 02:01:07,863
Thank you.

1092
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:10,107
I shouldn't admire it now.

1093
02:01:10,145 --> 02:01:13,022
I should find it absurdly personal.
Don't you agree?

1094
02:01:13,991 --> 02:01:17,346
Feelings, insights, affections.
It's suddenly trivial, now.

1095
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:20,789
You don't agree. You're wrong.

1096
02:01:21,029 --> 02:01:23,149
The personal life is dead in Russia.

1097
02:01:24,186 --> 02:01:25,710
History has killed it.

1098
02:01:26,986 --> 02:01:28,905
I can see how you might hate me.

1099
02:01:30,583 --> 02:01:33,909
I hate everything you say,
but not enough to kill you for it.

1100
02:01:36,423 --> 02:01:37,784
You have a brother?

1101
02:01:37,871 --> 02:01:38,704
Yevgraf?.

1102
02:01:38,782 --> 02:01:40,709
Yevgraf. Yes. The policeman.

1103
02:01:40,987 --> 02:01:42,385
I didn't know that.

1104
02:01:42,502 --> 02:01:45,630
Perhaps not. A "secret" policeman.
Did he send you here?

1105
02:01:45,669 --> 02:01:46,742
Yevgraf?.

1106
02:01:46,943 --> 02:01:48,582
No, Yevgraf's a Bolshevik.

1107
02:01:52,908 --> 02:01:55,669
I don't know anything about these things.

1108
02:01:55,745 --> 02:01:57,463
Oh, you know a great deal.

1109
02:01:58,625 --> 02:02:00,666
When you came in you recognized me.

1110
02:02:01,144 --> 02:02:02,179
How?

1111
02:02:02,507 --> 02:02:04,347
Has someone shown you photographs?

1112
02:02:04,424 --> 02:02:05,424
No.

1113
02:02:05,702 --> 02:02:07,869
I am certain that you recognized me.

1114
02:02:10,305 --> 02:02:12,386
I've seen you before, Commander.

1115
02:02:13,182 --> 02:02:14,151
When?

1116
02:02:14,506 --> 02:02:15,790
Six years ago.

1117
02:02:16,423 --> 02:02:17,546
Go on.

1118
02:02:17,986 --> 02:02:19,385
Christmas Eve. You--

1119
02:02:20,585 --> 02:02:21,784
You were there?

1120
02:02:22,426 --> 02:02:24,268
Or, has someone told you this?

1121
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:27,789
I attended to the man
who was injured by your wife.

1122
02:02:28,625 --> 02:02:30,464
Why do you call her my wife?

1123
02:02:31,749 --> 02:02:33,064
I met her again.

1124
02:02:33,428 --> 02:02:35,949
We served together on the Ukranian Front.

1125
02:02:36,140 --> 02:02:38,749
If she's with you,
I'm sure she'd vouch for me.

1126
02:02:39,104 --> 02:02:41,147
I haven't seen her since the war.

1127
02:02:42,144 --> 02:02:43,466
She's in Yuriatin.

1128
02:02:46,708 --> 02:02:47,909
Yuriatin!

1129
02:02:49,384 --> 02:02:54,029
The private life is dead,
for a man with any manhood.

1130
02:02:55,186 --> 02:02:58,141
We saw a sample of your manhood
on the way, a place called Mink.

1131
02:02:58,228 --> 02:03:00,020
They were selling horses to the Whites.

1132
02:03:00,068 --> 02:03:00,940
No.

1133
02:03:01,267 --> 02:03:03,059
It seems you burned the wrong village.

1134
02:03:03,107 --> 02:03:05,066
They always say that.
And what does it matter?

1135
02:03:05,143 --> 02:03:07,865
A village betrays us, a village is burnt.
The point's made.

1136
02:03:08,181 --> 02:03:10,063
Your point, their village.

1137
02:03:10,503 --> 02:03:11,663
Kolya!

1138
02:03:17,984 --> 02:03:21,225
And what will you do
with your wife and child in Varykino?

1139
02:03:21,302 --> 02:03:22,425
Just live.

1140
02:03:24,065 --> 02:03:25,942
Take him away. He's innocent.

1141
02:03:36,828 --> 02:03:38,027
You're lucky.

1142
02:04:11,104 --> 02:04:13,625
We've been diverted.
Do you know where we're going?

1143
02:04:13,702 --> 02:04:14,941
Varykino Halt.

1144
02:04:28,903 --> 02:04:29,900
Hello?

1145
02:04:33,745 --> 02:04:34,745
Hello?

1146
02:04:38,821 --> 02:04:40,105
How lovely!

1147
02:04:44,784 --> 02:04:46,222
Oh, how lovely!

1148
02:04:48,583 --> 02:04:49,627
Hello?

1149
02:04:50,624 --> 02:04:51,621
Hello?

1150
02:04:57,588 --> 02:04:59,306
Alexander Maximiovich?

1151
02:04:59,468 --> 02:05:00,427
Yes.

1152
02:05:01,299 --> 02:05:02,663
It's me, Petya.

1153
02:05:04,387 --> 02:05:05,185
Your Honor!

1154
02:05:05,261 --> 02:05:07,821
Now, now, now,
that's all done with, you know.

1155
02:05:10,141 --> 02:05:12,184
How do we get to the house, Petya?

1156
02:05:12,625 --> 02:05:14,140
As you always did, Your Honor.

1157
02:05:35,507 --> 02:05:36,783
Look, Sasha!

1158
02:05:41,389 --> 02:05:43,948
What is it, Petya? Forest fire?

1159
02:05:44,465 --> 02:05:46,499
Forest fire, Your Honor?

1160
02:05:46,584 --> 02:05:47,984
That's Yuriatin.

1161
02:05:48,742 --> 02:05:51,619
Poor souls.
First the Reds, then the Whites.

1162
02:05:52,023 --> 02:05:53,422
Now, the Reds again.

1163
02:05:54,065 --> 02:05:56,778
That's Strelnikov. His heart must be dead.

1164
02:06:00,740 --> 02:06:02,417
We'll soon be there, now, Sasha.

1165
02:06:02,466 --> 02:06:03,906
Another five miles.

1166
02:06:04,057 --> 02:06:07,703
Is it that far? One forgets.
How is the place?

1167
02:06:08,182 --> 02:06:11,981
Oh, well enough, Your Honor.
It's all locked up, you know.

1168
02:06:29,062 --> 02:06:30,182
Varykino!

1169
02:07:19,783 --> 02:07:21,624
All locked up, you see.

1170
02:07:27,979 --> 02:07:29,545
A body, styling itself.

1171
02:07:30,457 --> 02:07:33,304
The Yuriatin Committee
of Revolutionary Justice...

1172
02:07:33,985 --> 02:07:37,343
...has expropriated my house
in the name of the people.

1173
02:07:38,340 --> 02:07:39,625
Very well.

1174
02:07:39,739 --> 02:07:42,137
I'm one of the people, too!

1175
02:07:44,306 --> 02:07:46,865
Don't, Your Honor!
They'd call it counterrevolution.

1176
02:07:46,942 --> 02:07:48,860
- Get out of my way!
- Father, don't!

1177
02:07:48,937 --> 02:07:50,262
Petya brought us here.

1178
02:07:50,338 --> 02:07:52,744
That makes him
a counterrevolutionary, too.

1179
02:07:53,022 --> 02:07:55,066
They shoot counterrevolutionaries.

1180
02:08:07,618 --> 02:08:10,696
It's not the Reds in the town,
it's the Reds in the forest.

1181
02:08:10,936 --> 02:08:12,663
- Partisans.
- Here?

1182
02:08:12,778 --> 02:08:15,858
Who knows? They go where they want,
and they do what they want.

1183
02:08:15,943 --> 02:08:17,738
All we need is a roof, Petya.

1184
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:20,585
And a bit of garden. Is there nowhere?

1185
02:08:25,379 --> 02:08:27,182
They didn't lock the cottage.

1186
02:08:37,302 --> 02:08:39,056
Oh, yes, we can manage here.

1187
02:08:43,140 --> 02:08:44,580
Oh, the stove works.

1188
02:08:45,904 --> 02:08:47,860
I'll find you a few sticks of furniture.

1189
02:08:47,936 --> 02:08:49,459
And some seed potatoes?

1190
02:08:50,420 --> 02:08:53,143
I'm afraid the garden is dreadfully run back.

1191
02:09:03,540 --> 02:09:04,817
Yes. Thank you.

1192
02:09:33,297 --> 02:09:34,582
Well done, my boy.

1193
02:09:34,901 --> 02:09:37,739
I must say, scratch a Russian
and you'll find a peasant.

1194
02:09:37,817 --> 02:09:39,265
I've always said so.

1195
02:09:39,418 --> 02:09:40,779
Well, you're wrong.

1196
02:09:40,818 --> 02:09:43,541
He works like a peasant,
but he isn't a peasant.

1197
02:09:43,618 --> 02:09:45,700
I don't mind, Tonya. Really.

1198
02:09:46,016 --> 02:09:48,096
- It's a good life.
- It certainly is.

1199
02:09:48,183 --> 02:09:52,460
I wouldn't be surprised if you two didn't
look back on this time as one of your best.

1200
02:09:53,697 --> 02:09:56,419
Awfully glad about the expected
new arrival, Yuri.

1201
02:09:57,139 --> 02:09:58,983
Anna was born here, you know.

1202
02:09:59,539 --> 02:10:01,217
Oh, no, I didn't know that.

1203
02:10:01,380 --> 02:10:02,981
Well, I'm terribly glad.

1204
02:10:03,776 --> 02:10:05,379
Here's winged Mercury.

1205
02:10:07,777 --> 02:10:09,741
Looks a bit down in the mouth.

1206
02:10:11,737 --> 02:10:12,896
Enter.

1207
02:10:13,337 --> 02:10:15,014
What news from Yuriatin?

1208
02:10:15,138 --> 02:10:18,735
There's no lard, no sugar.
Oil, next week, perhaps.

1209
02:10:18,975 --> 02:10:22,459
There's flour, salt, coffee and nails.

1210
02:10:27,417 --> 02:10:28,463
Bad news?

1211
02:10:29,383 --> 02:10:31,981
Oh, Lord, not another purge!

1212
02:10:32,096 --> 02:10:33,180
No.

1213
02:10:33,256 --> 02:10:34,579
Strelnikov's gone.

1214
02:10:35,337 --> 02:10:36,497
That's not bad news.

1215
02:10:36,536 --> 02:10:39,662
No. He's in Manchuria, they say.

1216
02:10:44,297 --> 02:10:45,744
That's the news.

1217
02:11:05,940 --> 02:11:07,495
They've shot the tsar.

1218
02:11:10,016 --> 02:11:11,455
And all his family.

1219
02:11:14,859 --> 02:11:17,092
Oh, that's a savage deed.

1220
02:11:20,334 --> 02:11:21,695
What's it for?

1221
02:11:24,573 --> 02:11:26,743
It's to show there's no going back.

1222
02:12:36,502 --> 02:12:38,573
Yuri, why don't you go to Yuriatin?

1223
02:12:39,496 --> 02:12:42,534
Yes, why don't you, my boy?
It'd do you good.

1224
02:12:44,020 --> 02:12:45,938
Why? What's in Yuriatin?

1225
02:12:46,494 --> 02:12:48,173
It isn't Petersburg.

1226
02:12:48,258 --> 02:12:50,253
A very decent little library...

1227
02:12:50,378 --> 02:12:51,895
...if it's still there.

1228
02:12:52,375 --> 02:12:53,622
I wish you would.

1229
02:12:55,538 --> 02:12:57,015
No, I don't think so.

1230
02:12:57,859 --> 02:12:59,700
Anyway, the roads are blocked.

1231
02:14:59,250 --> 02:15:00,211
Zhivago?

1232
02:15:04,258 --> 02:15:05,217
Yes.

1233
02:15:10,770 --> 02:15:11,893
How are you?

1234
02:15:13,532 --> 02:15:15,133
What are you doing here?

1235
02:15:15,576 --> 02:15:16,850
We're at Varykino.

1236
02:15:18,978 --> 02:15:19,975
Varykino?

1237
02:15:26,616 --> 02:15:27,775
Why Varykino?

1238
02:15:28,533 --> 02:15:30,614
Why not? We had to go somewhere.

1239
02:15:30,815 --> 02:15:32,253
But, here!

1240
02:15:33,298 --> 02:15:36,576
I came here to find my husband.
The one who was reported killed.

1241
02:15:36,652 --> 02:15:38,811
Strelnikov. I met him.

1242
02:15:40,413 --> 02:15:41,497
Met him?

1243
02:15:41,651 --> 02:15:42,656
Yes.

1244
02:17:11,857 --> 02:17:13,929
How long have you been living here?

1245
02:17:15,175 --> 02:17:16,374
About a year.

1246
02:17:21,056 --> 02:17:22,014
Alone?

1247
02:17:22,138 --> 02:17:23,174
With Katya.

1248
02:17:24,257 --> 02:17:25,572
Where's Katya now?

1249
02:17:26,330 --> 02:17:27,336
At school.

1250
02:18:15,779 --> 02:18:17,128
Is Tonya with you?

1251
02:18:18,454 --> 02:18:19,499
All of us.

1252
02:18:20,294 --> 02:18:21,253
Sasha?

1253
02:18:21,454 --> 02:18:22,576
Of course.

1254
02:18:27,448 --> 02:18:29,049
What are we going to do?

1255
02:18:29,690 --> 02:18:30,850
I don't know.

1256
02:19:42,770 --> 02:19:43,768
Yuri?

1257
02:19:45,649 --> 02:19:47,449
It's awfully early, isn't it?

1258
02:19:48,094 --> 02:19:49,291
Half past six.

1259
02:19:50,049 --> 02:19:51,448
What are you doing?

1260
02:19:52,129 --> 02:19:53,770
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.

1261
02:19:54,575 --> 02:19:56,089
Is anything the matter?

1262
02:19:56,493 --> 02:19:57,413
No.

1263
02:20:02,335 --> 02:20:03,774
Shall I get some tea?

1264
02:20:06,094 --> 02:20:07,131
Yes, do.

1265
02:21:25,087 --> 02:21:27,927
Hello. You are silly. We called and called.

1266
02:21:28,014 --> 02:21:30,371
- Did you? I didn't hear.
- Well, we did.

1267
02:21:32,885 --> 02:21:34,573
- Hello, Lara.
- Hello.

1268
02:21:37,134 --> 02:21:39,052
How's Olya Petrovna?

1269
02:21:39,130 --> 02:21:40,892
She gets worse and worse.

1270
02:21:41,047 --> 02:21:43,644
She gave us C.I. and arithmetic
all morning.

1271
02:21:43,846 --> 02:21:44,891
C.I.?

1272
02:21:45,286 --> 02:21:46,810
Civic Instruction.

1273
02:21:47,126 --> 02:21:48,133
Look.

1274
02:21:50,811 --> 02:21:52,968
- That's very good, Katya.
- Thank you.

1275
02:21:53,370 --> 02:21:54,771
It's the tsar.

1276
02:21:56,815 --> 02:21:58,935
The tsar was an enemy of the people.

1277
02:22:00,332 --> 02:22:03,373
Well, he didn't know he was an enemy
of the people, you know.

1278
02:22:03,449 --> 02:22:05,693
Well, he should have known, shouldn't he?

1279
02:22:05,769 --> 02:22:07,170
Yes, he should.

1280
02:22:07,727 --> 02:22:11,296
Fancy not knowing C.I.
Doesn't your little boy go to school?

1281
02:22:11,650 --> 02:22:12,608
Lunch.

1282
02:22:13,327 --> 02:22:14,372
Good.

1283
02:22:14,928 --> 02:22:16,330
Come on, you.

1284
02:22:46,605 --> 02:22:47,611
Smell.

1285
02:22:52,447 --> 02:22:54,414
This one's a prize-fighter.

1286
02:22:55,008 --> 02:22:55,965
Yuri!

1287
02:22:58,249 --> 02:22:59,448
Wait a minute.

1288
02:23:00,329 --> 02:23:01,289
There.

1289
02:23:19,605 --> 02:23:21,570
I'm going in to Yuriatin, darling--

1290
02:23:21,647 --> 02:23:22,732
What? Now?

1291
02:23:22,809 --> 02:23:26,012
Yes, I want to get some morphine,
disinfectant...

1292
02:23:26,164 --> 02:23:27,728
I shan't need morphine.

1293
02:23:27,843 --> 02:23:29,003
You never know.

1294
02:23:29,091 --> 02:23:30,568
Well, I shan't need it today.

1295
02:23:30,645 --> 02:23:33,367
No. But, it's pretty close.
I hadn't realized it.

1296
02:23:35,525 --> 02:23:37,972
- You'll be back before it's dark?
- Long before.

1297
02:23:50,813 --> 02:23:53,449
Yes, yes, my darling. Do what's best.

1298
02:23:54,090 --> 02:23:55,684
I'm not coming back.

1299
02:23:55,847 --> 02:23:57,131
I understand.

1300
02:23:57,610 --> 02:23:59,013
But, never, Lara.

1301
02:24:00,364 --> 02:24:01,728
Do you understand?

1302
02:24:03,165 --> 02:24:04,487
Do you believe me?

1303
02:25:04,370 --> 02:25:06,728
Comrade Doctor, I need a medical officer.

1304
02:25:06,766 --> 02:25:09,328
Sorry. I have a wife and child in Varykino.

1305
02:25:09,605 --> 02:25:11,371
And a mistress in Yuriatin.

1306
02:25:13,883 --> 02:25:16,481
Comrade Medical Officer,
we are Red Partisans...

1307
02:25:16,644 --> 02:25:18,563
...and we shoot deserters. Up!

1308
02:25:31,251 --> 02:25:32,209
Up!

1309
02:26:06,043 --> 02:26:08,288
- Where are you taking me?
- To the Front.

1310
02:26:09,286 --> 02:26:11,809
- And where is the Front?
- Good question.

1311
02:26:11,848 --> 02:26:14,571
The Front is wherever there are
enemies of the Revolution.

1312
02:26:14,647 --> 02:26:16,564
Wherever there is one gang
of White Guards...

1313
02:26:16,642 --> 02:26:19,528
...one battalion of foreign interventionists,
that is the Front.

1314
02:26:19,606 --> 02:26:23,009
Wherever there is one resentful
bourgeois, one unreliable schoolmaster...

1315
02:26:23,047 --> 02:26:25,446
...one dubious poet hugging his private life.

1316
02:26:25,962 --> 02:26:27,564
That, too, is the Front.

1317
02:26:29,283 --> 02:26:31,010
How long are you going to keep me?

1318
02:26:31,047 --> 02:26:32,486
For as long as we need you.

1319
02:27:20,686 --> 02:27:21,645
Now!

1320
02:27:30,564 --> 02:27:31,648
Charge!

1321
02:28:26,726 --> 02:28:30,203
Well, that was easy. Come on, Doctor,
let's see what we've done.

1322
02:29:14,281 --> 02:29:16,526
"St. Michael's Military School."

1323
02:29:22,407 --> 02:29:24,690
You old bastard!

1324
02:29:36,167 --> 02:29:37,520
It doesn't matter.

1325
02:29:41,124 --> 02:29:43,284
Did you ever love a woman, Razin?

1326
02:29:43,687 --> 02:29:45,921
I once had a wife and four children.

1327
02:29:58,648 --> 02:29:59,807
He has been a good comrade.

1328
02:29:59,845 --> 02:30:01,562
He's been a good medical officer.

1329
02:30:01,602 --> 02:30:04,326
We took him from his wife,
we took him from his child.

1330
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:06,042
None of this matters.

1331
02:30:07,328 --> 02:30:09,686
What does matter, Comrade Commissar?

1332
02:30:10,079 --> 02:30:11,441
Tell me, I've forgotten.

1333
02:30:11,527 --> 02:30:13,646
This is contemptible. The doctor stays.

1334
02:30:13,724 --> 02:30:14,884
I command this unit!

1335
02:30:14,960 --> 02:30:17,684
We command jointly.
The "Party Bulletin" expressly states--

1336
02:30:20,524 --> 02:30:22,719
I could have you taken out and shot.

1337
02:30:23,639 --> 02:30:26,048
And could you have the Party
taken out and shot?

1338
02:30:26,566 --> 02:30:27,879
Try to understand.

1339
02:30:28,118 --> 02:30:31,648
As the military struggle nears its close,
the political struggle intensifies.

1340
02:30:32,002 --> 02:30:35,003
In the hour of victory
the military will have served its purpose.

1341
02:30:35,042 --> 02:30:37,201
All men will then be judged politically...

1342
02:30:37,805 --> 02:30:40,085
...regardless of their military record.

1343
02:30:41,437 --> 02:30:44,804
Meanwhile, there are still White units
in this area.

1344
02:30:44,880 --> 02:30:46,167
The doctor stays.

1345
02:30:46,886 --> 02:30:48,564
That concludes the meeting.

1346
02:31:38,644 --> 02:31:40,437
Comrade, where are you going?

1347
02:31:41,119 --> 02:31:42,958
Are you running away, Comrade?

1348
02:31:44,283 --> 02:31:45,404
Soldiers.

1349
02:31:45,760 --> 02:31:47,525
Red soldiers or White soldiers?

1350
02:31:47,602 --> 02:31:48,762
Soldiers.

1351
02:33:33,841 --> 02:33:34,955
Tonya!

1352
02:33:35,999 --> 02:33:37,034
Tonya!

1353
02:33:37,198 --> 02:33:38,195
Sasha!

1354
02:33:41,276 --> 02:33:42,196
Tonya!

1355
02:33:45,841 --> 02:33:46,799
Tonya!

1356
02:33:49,437 --> 02:33:50,358
Tonya!

1357
02:33:54,721 --> 02:33:55,680
Tonya!

1358
02:33:55,995 --> 02:33:56,955
Tonya!

1359
02:34:44,678 --> 02:34:45,963
This is Yuriatin?

1360
02:34:46,117 --> 02:34:47,716
Yes. Yuriatin.

1361
02:34:49,039 --> 02:34:50,881
What's happened at Varykino?

1362
02:34:50,958 --> 02:34:52,397
The Moscow folks?

1363
02:34:53,116 --> 02:34:53,921
Yes.

1364
02:34:53,960 --> 02:34:57,316
They've gone away. Gone away.
There's nobody at Varykino.

1365
02:35:48,318 --> 02:35:51,521
Lord what happiness!
They say you are alive.

1366
02:35:51,676 --> 02:35:53,479
Someone saw you near the Town.

1367
02:35:53,919 --> 02:35:57,716
I take it you have gone to Varykino,
so I'm going there myself with Katya.

1368
02:35:57,879 --> 02:36:01,361
But just in case, I've left a little food,
boiled potatoes mostly.

1369
02:36:01,437 --> 02:36:04,275
Put the lid back on the pan
or the rats will get it.

1370
02:36:04,361 --> 02:36:06,673
Oh, I'm mad with joy.

1371
02:37:19,674 --> 02:37:20,595
Tonya!

1372
02:37:22,311 --> 02:37:23,318
Tonya!

1373
02:37:24,201 --> 02:37:25,112
Yuri.

1374
02:37:25,160 --> 02:37:26,196
Tonya!

1375
02:37:26,475 --> 02:37:29,437
Yuri. Yuri, darling.

1376
02:37:44,198 --> 02:37:46,999
It's all right, Yuri. They're safe.

1377
02:37:47,956 --> 02:37:49,279
They're in Moscow.

1378
02:37:49,471 --> 02:37:50,919
- In Moscow?
- Yes.

1379
02:37:51,677 --> 02:37:53,154
- Tonya?
- All of them.

1380
02:37:53,719 --> 02:37:54,832
They're safe.

1381
02:37:56,356 --> 02:37:57,356
Safe.

1382
02:38:00,318 --> 02:38:01,718
Firing squad--

1383
02:38:38,439 --> 02:38:39,437
Better.

1384
02:38:48,319 --> 02:38:49,352
What?

1385
02:38:50,715 --> 02:38:52,912
I've got a letter for you.

1386
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,600
I've had it three months.

1387
02:38:56,795 --> 02:38:58,916
And it was three months getting here.

1388
02:38:59,317 --> 02:39:00,591
It's from Moscow.

1389
02:39:03,076 --> 02:39:04,679
I think it's from Tonya.

1390
02:39:05,121 --> 02:39:07,192
It's addressed to you. Care of me.

1391
02:39:09,599 --> 02:39:12,638
She came into Yuriatin to find you
when you vanished.

1392
02:39:13,953 --> 02:39:15,477
Someone sent her here.

1393
02:39:15,795 --> 02:39:16,916
You met?

1394
02:39:20,034 --> 02:39:21,317
She's very fine.

1395
02:39:31,552 --> 02:39:33,037
My dearest dear...

1396
02:39:33,680 --> 02:39:36,115
...I am sending this to Larissa Antipova...

1397
02:39:36,317 --> 02:39:38,992
...because if you are alive,
which God grant...

1398
02:39:39,471 --> 02:39:41,397
...I think that is where you will go.

1399
02:39:42,310 --> 02:39:44,872
We have a little daughter, Yuri,
did you know?

1400
02:39:45,918 --> 02:39:47,317
Her name is Anna.

1401
02:39:47,834 --> 02:39:49,399
Father sends greetings.

1402
02:39:50,032 --> 02:39:51,796
Sasha has grown quite a lot.

1403
02:39:52,035 --> 02:39:53,435
He is quite big now.

1404
02:39:54,395 --> 02:39:57,875
Whenever we speak of you
he weeps and won't be comforted.

1405
02:39:58,911 --> 02:40:00,840
This is what I have to tell you.

1406
02:40:00,954 --> 02:40:02,998
We are being deported from Russia.

1407
02:40:03,675 --> 02:40:06,517
We can't make out
if you would be allowed to join us.

1408
02:40:07,072 --> 02:40:09,519
An organization in Paris
which I mustn't name...

1409
02:40:09,595 --> 02:40:11,110
...will know where we are...

1410
02:40:11,197 --> 02:40:13,798
...but nothing is certain
and there is very little time.

1411
02:40:13,874 --> 02:40:15,551
I am writing this in haste.

1412
02:40:16,356 --> 02:40:18,073
They are coming for us now.

1413
02:40:18,437 --> 02:40:19,635
God bless you.

1414
02:40:20,709 --> 02:40:23,749
I must honestly admit
that Antipova is a good person.

1415
02:40:34,558 --> 02:40:37,753
Yuri, when they got away to Moscow,
she left something here.

1416
02:41:13,313 --> 02:41:14,359
Yuri!

1417
02:41:38,871 --> 02:41:40,118
May I come in?

1418
02:41:42,477 --> 02:41:44,912
Yuri Andreyevich, you've changed, I think.

1419
02:41:46,352 --> 02:41:47,953
Oh, yes, decidedly.

1420
02:41:49,715 --> 02:41:50,713
Larissa...

1421
02:41:52,756 --> 02:41:54,274
...remarkably the same.

1422
02:42:01,754 --> 02:42:03,154
I came from Moscow.

1423
02:42:04,429 --> 02:42:06,233
I'm on my way to Vladivostock.

1424
02:42:13,750 --> 02:42:15,592
I'm here to offer you my help.

1425
02:42:15,668 --> 02:42:17,069
We don't want it.

1426
02:42:17,272 --> 02:42:18,556
Speak for yourself.

1427
02:42:18,633 --> 02:42:19,918
We don't want it.

1428
02:42:20,272 --> 02:42:23,831
Yuri Andreyevich, you spent two years
with the Partisans, Fifth Division.

1429
02:42:23,918 --> 02:42:26,352
You have no discharge
so you are a deserter.

1430
02:42:26,554 --> 02:42:30,150
Your family in Paris is involved
in a dangerous migr organization.

1431
02:42:30,352 --> 02:42:32,307
Now all these are technicalities.

1432
02:42:33,277 --> 02:42:34,915
But your style of life...

1433
02:42:34,991 --> 02:42:36,836
...everything you say and think...

1434
02:42:36,912 --> 02:42:40,191
...your published writings
are all flagrantly subversive.

1435
02:42:40,469 --> 02:42:41,996
Your days are numbered.

1436
02:42:42,551 --> 02:42:43,837
Unless I help you.

1437
02:42:44,555 --> 02:42:46,107
Do you want my help?

1438
02:42:47,029 --> 02:42:47,951
No.

1439
02:42:48,956 --> 02:42:50,030
Wait, Yuri.

1440
02:42:55,228 --> 02:42:57,068
Larissa, three glasses.

1441
02:42:57,673 --> 02:42:58,674
No!

1442
02:42:59,354 --> 02:43:02,077
Yuri, you must see how serious this is.

1443
02:43:05,549 --> 02:43:07,352
Please don't underestimate me.

1444
02:43:07,677 --> 02:43:11,032
Practically, or morally,
I am not the man you take me for.

1445
02:43:13,151 --> 02:43:15,272
How do you know all this about Yuri?

1446
02:43:15,674 --> 02:43:16,950
How can you help?

1447
02:43:17,430 --> 02:43:19,675
I do and I can. Isn't that sufficient?

1448
02:43:20,030 --> 02:43:20,991
No.

1449
02:43:23,156 --> 02:43:24,353
Sant, Larissa.

1450
02:43:34,749 --> 02:43:37,147
Our eastern seaboard is
an undeveloped area.

1451
02:43:38,355 --> 02:43:42,672
The Commissariat of Foreign Affairs wants
to establish an independent state there.

1452
02:43:43,190 --> 02:43:47,110
It affords us a temporary channel
of communication with the outside world.

1453
02:43:47,869 --> 02:43:50,506
I've good contacts in the Far East.

1454
02:43:51,793 --> 02:43:54,228
I've been appointed the minister of justice.

1455
02:43:54,670 --> 02:43:56,031
The Bolsheviks trust you?

1456
02:43:56,108 --> 02:43:59,473
They trust no one.
They've found me useful.

1457
02:44:04,357 --> 02:44:05,996
Here's how I can help you.

1458
02:44:06,752 --> 02:44:07,712
You...

1459
02:44:08,557 --> 02:44:10,752
You come with me
as far as the Pacific Coast.

1460
02:44:10,830 --> 02:44:13,150
And from there you can go where you like.

1461
02:44:13,957 --> 02:44:15,355
To Paris.

1462
02:44:15,433 --> 02:44:16,392
Or not.

1463
02:44:17,349 --> 02:44:18,952
I think you'd better go.

1464
02:44:19,556 --> 02:44:23,507
Your rarified selfishness is intolerable.

1465
02:44:24,430 --> 02:44:26,068
Larissa's in danger, too.

1466
02:44:26,874 --> 02:44:28,428
By association with me?

1467
02:44:28,552 --> 02:44:31,514
No. Not by association with you.
You're small fry.

1468
02:44:32,588 --> 02:44:34,593
By association with Strelnikov.

1469
02:44:35,034 --> 02:44:36,549
I've never met Strelnikov.

1470
02:44:36,626 --> 02:44:39,071
You're married to Strelnikov.
They know that.

1471
02:44:39,513 --> 02:44:41,354
I was married to Pasha Antipov.

1472
02:44:41,430 --> 02:44:44,787
I understand, I understand.
But they don't.

1473
02:44:45,593 --> 02:44:46,994
You're being watched.

1474
02:44:48,193 --> 02:44:49,469
Do you know why?

1475
02:44:50,869 --> 02:44:54,272
A husband is a sticky commodity, my dear.

1476
02:44:55,635 --> 02:44:56,747
Go away!

1477
02:44:59,508 --> 02:45:02,672
More of your high-minded lunacy.

1478
02:45:04,073 --> 02:45:05,866
You have a child to think of.

1479
02:45:06,433 --> 02:45:07,471
Look here.

1480
02:45:08,468 --> 02:45:09,514
Here.

1481
02:45:09,993 --> 02:45:11,470
That's sugar for the child.

1482
02:45:11,557 --> 02:45:12,832
I don't want it.

1483
02:45:14,193 --> 02:45:15,995
You'd refuse my sugar?

1484
02:45:17,433 --> 02:45:19,427
Who are you to refuse me anything?

1485
02:45:19,667 --> 02:45:20,713
Now you go!

1486
02:45:24,788 --> 02:45:26,073
- I came--
- Go!

1487
02:45:27,108 --> 02:45:28,105
Go!

1488
02:45:29,709 --> 02:45:31,867
I came to you in good faith.

1489
02:45:37,026 --> 02:45:39,384
You stay here then and get your desserts!

1490
02:45:42,953 --> 02:45:44,793
Your desserts, do you hear me?

1491
02:45:48,630 --> 02:45:50,434
You think you're immaculate.

1492
02:45:54,637 --> 02:45:56,111
You're not immaculate!

1493
02:45:58,392 --> 02:45:59,554
I know you!

1494
02:46:01,434 --> 02:46:03,027
Do you hear me?

1495
02:46:03,830 --> 02:46:08,186
We're all made of the same clay, you know.

1496
02:46:09,833 --> 02:46:10,832
Clay!

1497
02:46:12,310 --> 02:46:13,912
Clay!

1498
02:46:18,669 --> 02:46:19,713
Lara.

1499
02:46:22,713 --> 02:46:24,104
He's rubbish, Lara.

1500
02:46:25,629 --> 02:46:27,031
Yes, rubbish.

1501
02:46:29,666 --> 02:46:31,345
I wish he'd never happened.

1502
02:46:32,188 --> 02:46:33,467
Does it matter?

1503
02:46:34,433 --> 02:46:35,671
Doesn't it?

1504
02:46:36,112 --> 02:46:37,108
Not to me.

1505
02:46:46,632 --> 02:46:48,952
What shall we do? Can we get on a train?

1506
02:46:49,508 --> 02:46:51,466
No, they'd arrest us on the spot.

1507
02:46:52,347 --> 02:46:54,429
I don't want to stay here and wait.

1508
02:46:54,708 --> 02:46:55,668
No.

1509
02:46:58,314 --> 02:46:59,273
Listen.

1510
02:47:00,750 --> 02:47:02,590
- We could go to--
- Varykino.

1511
02:47:05,151 --> 02:47:07,070
They'd find out sooner or later.

1512
02:47:07,588 --> 02:47:08,785
Yes, but later.

1513
02:47:09,593 --> 02:47:11,624
And if our days are really numbered, Yuri--

1514
02:47:11,711 --> 02:47:13,992
Yes. We'd better live them.

1515
02:47:16,785 --> 02:47:18,423
Before we're parted.

1516
02:47:19,191 --> 02:47:20,152
Yes.

1517
02:49:52,905 --> 02:49:56,270
Anna taught me to write at this desk.

1518
02:53:41,418 --> 02:53:42,858
This isn't me, Yuri.

1519
02:53:44,184 --> 02:53:45,220
Yes, it is.

1520
02:53:46,188 --> 02:53:47,146
No.

1521
02:53:48,459 --> 02:53:49,419
It's you.

1522
02:53:54,741 --> 02:53:55,786
"Lara."

1523
02:54:43,978 --> 02:54:44,984
Yuri!

1524
02:54:46,059 --> 02:54:47,861
Yuri, there's a wolf howling!

1525
02:54:48,065 --> 02:54:49,703
Oh, yes.

1526
02:54:53,625 --> 02:54:56,616
I've seen them. They're frightened.
They won't harm us.

1527
02:54:57,060 --> 02:54:58,900
Yes. I know.

1528
02:55:00,300 --> 02:55:01,347
I'm sorry.

1529
02:55:10,027 --> 02:55:12,942
Oh, Lord, this is an awful time to be alive.

1530
02:55:13,546 --> 02:55:14,505
No.

1531
02:55:14,581 --> 02:55:15,942
It is. Oh, it is!

1532
02:55:15,982 --> 02:55:16,940
No. No.

1533
02:56:20,065 --> 02:56:22,344
Wouldn't it have been lovely
if we'd met before?

1534
02:56:22,383 --> 02:56:23,621
Before we did?

1535
02:56:24,705 --> 02:56:25,664
Yes.

1536
02:56:28,137 --> 02:56:30,861
We'd have got married
and had a house and children.

1537
02:56:34,065 --> 02:56:37,739
If we'd had children, Yuri,
would you have liked a boy or a girl?

1538
02:56:39,138 --> 02:56:42,984
I think we may go mad,
if we think about all that.

1539
02:56:43,616 --> 02:56:45,496
I shall always think about it.

1540
02:56:46,895 --> 02:56:49,063
- Will you write today?
- No, not today.

1541
02:57:07,976 --> 02:57:08,945
Katya!

1542
02:57:10,738 --> 02:57:12,176
Come to me, darling.

1543
02:57:24,703 --> 02:57:25,661
Victor!

1544
02:57:27,340 --> 02:57:28,738
We thought it was--

1545
02:57:30,176 --> 02:57:31,137
Quiet.

1546
02:57:33,545 --> 02:57:35,500
I wonder if you'd mind, Comrades?

1547
02:57:39,900 --> 02:57:42,854
There's a train belonging
to my government standing in Yuriatin.

1548
02:57:42,942 --> 02:57:45,463
It has a carriage for myself
and my assistants.

1549
02:57:45,578 --> 02:57:48,303
You would travel in comfort and safety.

1550
02:57:48,582 --> 02:57:50,701
There's no question.
I'm not going with you.

1551
02:57:50,779 --> 02:57:53,702
I'm not going without you.
So, there's an end to it.

1552
02:57:54,334 --> 02:57:57,374
Well, then, I'll have to speak
to Yuri Andreyevich in private.

1553
02:58:12,425 --> 02:58:13,861
Strelnikov is dead.

1554
02:58:14,657 --> 02:58:15,501
What?

1555
02:58:15,540 --> 02:58:17,620
Spare me your expressions of regret.

1556
02:58:17,736 --> 02:58:21,102
He was a murderous neurotic
and no loss to anyone.

1557
02:58:21,982 --> 02:58:24,057
Do you see how this affects Larissa?

1558
02:58:24,382 --> 02:58:25,380
You don't.

1559
02:58:26,462 --> 02:58:27,622
You're a fool.

1560
02:58:32,140 --> 02:58:33,579
She's Strelnikov's wife.

1561
02:58:33,656 --> 02:58:36,781
Why do you think they haven't
arrested her? Is this the usual practice?

1562
02:58:36,858 --> 02:58:39,216
Why do you think
they had her watched in Yuriatin?

1563
02:58:39,293 --> 02:58:41,297
They were waiting for Strelnikov.

1564
02:58:41,662 --> 02:58:44,338
If they thought that he would
come running to his wife...

1565
02:58:44,414 --> 02:58:45,739
...they didn't know him.

1566
02:58:45,816 --> 02:58:47,179
They knew him well enough.

1567
02:58:47,216 --> 02:58:50,103
He was only five miles from here
when they caught him.

1568
02:58:50,296 --> 02:58:53,297
He was arrested on the open road.
He didn't conceal his identity.

1569
02:58:53,383 --> 02:58:56,613
Throughout the entire interview,
he insisted they call him Pavel Antipov...

1570
02:58:56,661 --> 02:59:00,181
...which is his right name, and refused
to answer to the name of Strelnikov.

1571
02:59:00,296 --> 02:59:03,137
On his way to execution,
he took a pistol from one of the guards...

1572
02:59:03,176 --> 02:59:04,776
...and blew his own brains out.

1573
02:59:05,419 --> 02:59:06,704
Oh, my God!

1574
02:59:08,624 --> 02:59:09,821
Don't tell Lara this.

1575
02:59:10,138 --> 02:59:12,699
I think I know Lara at least as well as you.

1576
02:59:12,775 --> 02:59:15,977
But don't you see her position?
She's served her purpose.

1577
02:59:16,179 --> 02:59:18,539
These men that came with me today
as an escort...

1578
02:59:18,578 --> 02:59:21,540
...will come for her and the child tomorrow,
as a firing squad.

1579
02:59:21,980 --> 02:59:24,501
Now, I know exactly what you think of me.

1580
02:59:24,617 --> 02:59:25,614
And why.

1581
02:59:26,256 --> 02:59:28,982
But if you're not coming with me,
she's not coming with me.

1582
02:59:29,903 --> 02:59:31,783
So, are you coming with me?

1583
02:59:32,339 --> 02:59:34,898
Do you accept the protection
of this ignoble Caliban...

1584
02:59:34,974 --> 02:59:37,738
...on any terms that Caliban cares to make?

1585
02:59:38,139 --> 02:59:43,617
Or, is your delicacy so exorbitant that you
would sacrifice a woman and a child to it?

1586
02:59:52,814 --> 02:59:55,057
There are some bags to carry, Comrades.

1587
03:00:11,179 --> 03:00:12,216
Get in!

1588
03:00:16,943 --> 03:00:17,853
Come.

1589
03:00:21,939 --> 03:00:23,177
- How many?
- All of us.

1590
03:00:23,253 --> 03:00:24,536
Sorry, not enough room.

1591
03:00:24,615 --> 03:00:26,378
Comrade, there's got to be room.

1592
03:00:26,416 --> 03:00:28,498
It's all right, I have to bring our sledge.

1593
03:00:28,574 --> 03:00:31,538
Hurry. This train can't wait.
There are important people on it.

1594
03:00:31,614 --> 03:00:33,295
You start, I'll catch you up.

1595
03:00:39,173 --> 03:00:40,460
Right, Comrades!

1596
03:00:42,855 --> 03:00:44,141
We'll see you.

1597
03:00:45,100 --> 03:00:46,222
Hurry!

1598
03:02:18,058 --> 03:02:21,251
I'm afraid that's it, my dear.
Your young man's not coming.

1599
03:02:21,817 --> 03:02:22,776
You fool!

1600
03:02:24,050 --> 03:02:26,536
Did you really think
he would come with you?

1601
03:02:35,617 --> 03:02:37,017
The man's an idiot.

1602
03:02:39,012 --> 03:02:41,054
From Mongolia
he could have gone to China.

1603
03:02:41,131 --> 03:02:42,658
He'll never leave Russia.

1604
03:02:42,734 --> 03:02:45,296
Let him stay.
You've come with me, haven't you?

1605
03:02:46,733 --> 03:02:47,655
Yes.

1606
03:02:49,255 --> 03:02:51,655
To be sure, it was your duty as a mother.

1607
03:02:52,852 --> 03:02:54,338
That's right, Victor.

1608
03:02:57,054 --> 03:02:58,981
I'm carrying Yuri's child.

1609
03:03:04,457 --> 03:03:07,661
I was born out there,
in the Far East, somewhere.

1610
03:03:08,101 --> 03:03:10,575
I think it was Mongolia. I don't remember.

1611
03:03:10,651 --> 03:03:13,412
You were born in Mongolia.
And you were born that very year.

1612
03:03:13,500 --> 03:03:15,292
So were a lot of other children.

1613
03:03:15,330 --> 03:03:18,698
Not many called Tonya, bearing the name
Komarov, or Komarovsky.

1614
03:03:18,937 --> 03:03:20,817
Komarov's a common name. So is Tonya.

1615
03:03:20,893 --> 03:03:23,414
With fair hair and blue eyes,
lost at the age of eight...

1616
03:03:23,492 --> 03:03:25,738
...when the civil war broke out
in the Far East.

1617
03:03:25,814 --> 03:03:27,695
There's something you haven't told me.

1618
03:03:27,781 --> 03:03:29,574
How did you come to be lost?

1619
03:03:30,177 --> 03:03:31,338
I can't remember.

1620
03:03:31,414 --> 03:03:33,371
I don't believe that.
You must remember something.

1621
03:03:33,459 --> 03:03:34,253
No!

1622
03:03:35,980 --> 03:03:38,136
Shall I tell you
how I first met your mother?

1623
03:03:38,213 --> 03:03:40,093
If she was my mother, Comrade General.

1624
03:03:40,132 --> 03:03:41,139
You doubt it?

1625
03:03:41,292 --> 03:03:44,535
I picked my brother up, literally picked
him up, on a Moscow street.

1626
03:03:44,611 --> 03:03:47,938
He had a fourth-class ration book
and he was undernourished.

1627
03:03:48,178 --> 03:03:50,539
He didn't seem to mind that, or anything.

1628
03:03:50,931 --> 03:03:53,251
I thought he was a happier man than me.

1629
03:03:54,574 --> 03:03:56,732
He suffered me to buy him a new suit.

1630
03:03:57,490 --> 03:03:59,859
And to get him a job at his old hospital.

1631
03:04:00,654 --> 03:04:02,899
I saw him off for his first day's work.

1632
03:04:03,292 --> 03:04:07,617
This was eight years
after he and Lara parted.

1633
03:04:09,096 --> 03:04:10,620
So, he never saw her again?

1634
03:04:15,538 --> 03:04:17,811
Thank you. You've been very kind to me.

1635
03:04:24,611 --> 03:04:28,456
He must have known how ill he was.
The walls of his heart were like paper.

1636
03:04:28,898 --> 03:04:32,734
But, he kept it to himself.
He kept a lot to himself.

1637
03:04:56,652 --> 03:04:57,612
Please!

1638
03:06:01,177 --> 03:06:04,214
I was astonished at the extent
of his reputation.

1639
03:06:05,049 --> 03:06:09,097
His work was unobtainable at the time.
It was disapproved ofby the Party.

1640
03:06:09,893 --> 03:06:12,453
But, ifpeople love poetry, they love poets.

1641
03:06:13,412 --> 03:06:15,253
And nobody loves poetry like a Russian.

1642
03:06:25,333 --> 03:06:26,695
Excuse me, Comrade.

1643
03:06:27,932 --> 03:06:29,208
Are you Yevgraf?.

1644
03:06:30,368 --> 03:06:31,578
My name's Lara.

1645
03:06:31,894 --> 03:06:33,851
I knew her name from the Lara poems...

1646
03:06:33,888 --> 03:06:36,449
...which I'd found
among my brother's manuscripts.

1647
03:06:37,169 --> 03:06:38,656
I knew your brother.

1648
03:06:40,335 --> 03:06:41,694
I need your help.

1649
03:06:42,251 --> 03:06:44,774
She'd come to Moscow
to look for her child.

1650
03:06:45,214 --> 03:06:47,094
I helped her as far as I could.

1651
03:06:50,692 --> 03:06:52,415
But, I knew it was hopeless.

1652
03:06:58,055 --> 03:07:00,375
I think I was a little in love with her.

1653
03:07:08,577 --> 03:07:10,974
One day she went away
and didn't come back.

1654
03:07:11,492 --> 03:07:14,013
She died, or vanished, somewhere...

1655
03:07:14,091 --> 03:07:15,971
...in one of the labor camps...

1656
03:07:16,374 --> 03:07:20,053
...a nameless number on a list
that was afterwards mislaid.

1657
03:07:21,256 --> 03:07:23,490
That was quite common in those days.

1658
03:07:33,491 --> 03:07:35,333
How did you come to be lost?

1659
03:07:37,212 --> 03:07:39,331
- We were running in the street.
- We?

1660
03:07:39,408 --> 03:07:41,853
- My father.
- Not your father, Komarovsky.

1661
03:07:41,931 --> 03:07:43,092
I don't know.

1662
03:07:43,696 --> 03:07:45,375
The street was under fire.

1663
03:07:45,576 --> 03:07:48,933
There were explosions
and the houses were falling down...

1664
03:07:50,936 --> 03:07:52,654
...and he let go of my hand.

1665
03:07:54,407 --> 03:07:55,854
He let go of my hand.

1666
03:07:57,850 --> 03:07:59,049
And I was lost.

1667
03:08:02,607 --> 03:08:04,450
Would a father have done that?

1668
03:08:04,929 --> 03:08:07,768
Oh, yes, people will do anything.

1669
03:08:08,132 --> 03:08:09,455
It was Komarovsky.

1670
03:08:12,975 --> 03:08:16,255
This man was your father.

1671
03:08:18,690 --> 03:08:20,330
Why won't you believe it?

1672
03:08:21,567 --> 03:08:23,331
Don't you want to believe it?

1673
03:08:24,214 --> 03:08:25,857
Not if it isn't true.

1674
03:08:29,530 --> 03:08:30,814
That's inherited.

1675
03:08:31,256 --> 03:08:34,773
Comrade General, when I was a child,
I wanted parents.

1676
03:08:35,973 --> 03:08:38,208
You can imagine how I wanted parents.

1677
03:08:39,732 --> 03:08:43,289
I wanted to die when I was a child,
you know?

1678
03:08:46,846 --> 03:08:48,171
Now, I don't know.

1679
03:08:50,330 --> 03:08:52,851
I can't be of any use to them, now, can I?

1680
03:08:53,772 --> 03:08:56,169
I was hoping I might be
of some use to you.

1681
03:08:58,489 --> 03:09:00,092
Will you think about it?

1682
03:09:00,168 --> 03:09:01,129
Yes.

1683
03:09:06,852 --> 03:09:08,330
It's all right, David.

1684
03:09:11,686 --> 03:09:12,733
Do you work here?

1685
03:09:12,809 --> 03:09:14,536
Yes, Comrade General. I'm an operator.

1686
03:09:14,612 --> 03:09:16,051
And what do you operate?

1687
03:09:17,412 --> 03:09:18,335
That!

1688
03:09:33,611 --> 03:09:35,374
You've promised to think about it.

1689
03:09:47,964 --> 03:09:48,924
Tonya!

1690
03:09:50,765 --> 03:09:52,370
Can you play the balalaika?

1691
03:09:52,609 --> 03:09:53,769
Can she play?

1692
03:09:54,249 --> 03:09:55,534
She's an artist!

1693
03:09:55,735 --> 03:09:57,933
An artist? Who taught you?

1694
03:09:58,689 --> 03:10:00,213
No one taught her.

1695
03:10:02,208 --> 03:10:03,494
Then, it's a gift.
