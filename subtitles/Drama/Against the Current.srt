1
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,117
Good morning.

2
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,413
Hi.

3
00:02:29,596 --> 00:02:30,621
You sleep all right?

4
00:02:34,652 --> 00:02:35,646
You?

5
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,694
Not really.

6
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:42,594
Ah... There's more Cokes,
and l could get you a coffee if you'd like.

7
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,505
Want to go for some pancakes or something?

8
00:02:45,886 --> 00:02:47,328
l'm totally starving.

9
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:52,322
Actually, l already had one of those...

10
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,241
Maybe l should get going, anyway.

11
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:04,802
l gotta take care of some stuff.

12
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:17,512
What the hell do you want?

13
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,784
An incredibly complicated
and elaborate drink

14
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:21,800
that takes you about 10 minutes to make.

15
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,842
Then l'd like to complain about
how there's no alcohol in it.

16
00:04:24,935 --> 00:04:26,312
That's our best seller.

17
00:04:27,144 --> 00:04:29,515
You want a massage
and manual release with that?

18
00:04:30,664 --> 00:04:31,977
Maybe later.

19
00:04:32,392 --> 00:04:34,506
- l wanted to ask you something.
-Yes?

20
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,329
You have any plans
for the next month or so?

21
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,715
You mean other than going on auditions that
will lead nowhere and babysitting drunks?

22
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:43,146
l want to do the river swim.

23
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:44,778
What river swim?

24
00:04:45,064 --> 00:04:47,628
The river swim, the one l've been
talking about since high school,

25
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,611
the entire length of the lower Hudson,

26
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,973
all the way from Troy
to the Verrazano Bridge, 150 miles.

27
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,859
Why?

28
00:04:54,954 --> 00:04:56,012
Just because.

29
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:57,516
-Just because?
- Right.

30
00:04:58,218 --> 00:05:00,621
You accompany me in a boat,
like we talked about.

31
00:05:00,843 --> 00:05:01,964
What do you say?

32
00:05:03,338 --> 00:05:05,004
Not many people have swam the whole river.

33
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:08,911
Not many people have dug up
Babe Ruth and driven around

34
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:10,957
with his skeleton in their car either,

35
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:13,806
which was another idea
that we had one drunken night.

36
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,820
l know, but l mean it.

37
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:18,541
l want to swim the river.

38
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,263
We can leave Monday
and be back by the 28th.

39
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:23,533
Why now?

40
00:05:23,853 --> 00:05:25,006
Why not?

41
00:05:29,165 --> 00:05:30,349
Sarah's not going to like it.

42
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:32,110
Hi.

43
00:05:32,494 --> 00:05:33,710
Hey.

44
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:35,759
Liz... Hi. You remember Paul.

45
00:05:35,854 --> 00:05:38,352
Sure. You're a financial writer or something?

46
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:42,065
Or something, right. And you waitressed
here a couple of summers ago.

47
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,375
Never again.

48
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,296
A sentiment shared by the management.

49
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:46,543
l wasn't that bad.

50
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:47,888
Nor were you any good.

51
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,097
You're actually a teacher, right?

52
00:05:50,191 --> 00:05:51,248
Yeah.

53
00:05:51,343 --> 00:05:52,945
For retarded kids or something.

54
00:05:53,327 --> 00:05:55,056
No, regular ones.

55
00:05:55,151 --> 00:05:56,497
Oh. Don't know where l got that.

56
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:59,859
May l have a very strong
vodka and soda, please, Jeff?

57
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:03,123
One Alcoholic's Special coming up.

58
00:06:03,536 --> 00:06:06,451
So, what are you boys up to tonight?

59
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,948
Talking about 19-year-old girls
with big tits or something?

60
00:06:09,042 --> 00:06:10,674
Maybe. What's it to you?

61
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:15,893
Actually, it looks like
we're going on a swimming trip.

62
00:06:16,913 --> 00:06:18,258
A swimming trip?

63
00:06:18,354 --> 00:06:19,731
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

64
00:06:20,467 --> 00:06:23,349
Paul's gonna swim the entire length
of the Hudson River.

65
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,267
Why would you do that?

66
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,444
Why do people climb Everest?

67
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:28,531
Most people don't.

68
00:06:30,163 --> 00:06:32,405
l didn't realize you were a big-time swimmer.

69
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:36,246
l'm not. It's iust an idea l had long ago
and it's just kind of stayed with me,

70
00:06:36,339 --> 00:06:40,311
to swim all the way down the river
to where it meets the ocean.

71
00:06:41,268 --> 00:06:42,901
Don't you think you'd get a little pooped?

72
00:06:42,996 --> 00:06:45,013
l don't swim it all at once.

73
00:06:45,302 --> 00:06:48,217
lt's more a psychological challenge
than a physical one.

74
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,525
Anyone could do it if they wanted to.

75
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:52,599
Totally eccentric, l like it.

76
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:54,167
Then come with us.

77
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,990
-Right, right.
- Really.

78
00:06:56,086 --> 00:06:57,558
Or just go instead of me.

79
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,818
Come on.
You're asking me to take a couple weeks off

80
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:04,761
and drive a boat,
slowly, down the Hudson river

81
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,327
while you're in the water all day?

82
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:08,633
lf she wants to come, thank God.

83
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:11,353
lt'll give me someone
to make fun of you with to pass the time.

84
00:07:14,071 --> 00:07:17,851
Well, l don't want to interfere if it's gonna...
If it's some sort of male bonding thing.

85
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:20,634
Please. If we were any more bonded,
we'd be 69-ing each other.

86
00:07:20,727 --> 00:07:22,552
-You should come with us.
-l actually could come.

87
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,338
l don't start school till after Labor Day.

88
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:28,058
We could spend a night at my mom's house
in Rhinebeck,

89
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:29,819
along the way, if you want. Free beds.

90
00:07:29,913 --> 00:07:33,276
See? She's from the Hudson Valley, too.
She's one of us.

91
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,426
l'm not sure.

92
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,850
What kind of bathing suits do you have?

93
00:07:38,714 --> 00:07:40,956
'Cause we usually wear a two-piece.

94
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:45,339
l don't think it'd be very much fun.

95
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:47,164
-lt might be.
-l don't know.

96
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,362
You finally take some time off...

97
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,501
l think it's really important to him
for some reason.

98
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,773
So you and Paul get to spend
three weeks alone together

99
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:57,660
and l get to sit here all by myself.

100
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:01,373
Liz is coming with us, too.

101
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:05,150
The girl from the bar? Are you kidding me?

102
00:08:05,245 --> 00:08:06,174
She wants to come.

103
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:08,157
What?
Is Paul sleeping with her or something?

104
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:09,276
No.

105
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,902
-Are you?
-No.

106
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:15,007
-Then why is she coming?
-Just for fun.

107
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,559
Why didn't you ask me if l wanted to come?

108
00:08:18,653 --> 00:08:20,222
-Do you?
-No, it's stupid.

109
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:21,822
Then don't come.

110
00:08:23,005 --> 00:08:24,191
Fuck you.

111
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:26,591
Right.

112
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,863
- What?
-Hmm? Nothing.

113
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,494
What?

114
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:32,800
Nothing.

115
00:08:51,201 --> 00:08:53,794
Because l feel like getting out of the city, l...

116
00:08:54,624 --> 00:08:55,874
Neither of them.

117
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,138
No.

118
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:04,676
l'll, uh... l'll call you when we get close.

119
00:09:06,018 --> 00:09:07,395
Three weeks or so.

120
00:09:10,946 --> 00:09:15,079
Yeah, l guess it is a three-week vacation,
if you want to call it that.

121
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:57,447
Yeah, we'll probably get there
around about 1:00.

122
00:09:57,543 --> 00:10:00,425
We can drop off the car, head down
to the waterfront and find a boat.

123
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:01,895
You're really gonna buy a boat?

124
00:10:02,598 --> 00:10:05,931
Yeah, it's easier than trying to rent one.
We'll get a used one or something.

125
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:07,433
What are you gonna do with it
when we get to the city?

126
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,347
l don't know.
Try to sell it or something, l guess.

127
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,265
How much do boats cost?

128
00:10:14,119 --> 00:10:15,881
l'm not sure. Don't worry about it.

129
00:10:16,328 --> 00:10:19,178
l didn't realize l was traveling
with John D. Rockefeller here.

130
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,155
Which way to the boatyard?

131
00:10:45,194 --> 00:10:46,827
-Can l help you?
-We're looking to buy a boat.

132
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,139
Well, you sure can't have one for free!

133
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:11,406
-What kind of boat?
-What?

134
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,456
What kind of boat are you looking for?

135
00:11:13,645 --> 00:11:15,726
Oh, uh, the smallest one you got.

136
00:11:15,821 --> 00:11:17,487
Like a canoe?

137
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:18,574
A motor boat.

138
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,663
With a weak motor.

139
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,775
-A weak motor?
-Weakest one you got.

140
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:24,432
He's gonna swim down the river to the city
and we need to ride next to him.

141
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:26,802
So iust, you know,
anything that can putter along beside.

142
00:11:26,895 --> 00:11:28,848
-You're swimming to New York City?
-Yeah.

143
00:11:29,327 --> 00:11:33,427
ls it some sort of charity-type of thing,
or a dollar-a-mile or something?

144
00:11:33,615 --> 00:11:34,544
Not really.

145
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:36,209
Hmm.

146
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:41,173
Well, l got an old whaler with
an old 70-horsepower engine.

147
00:11:41,266 --> 00:11:42,706
Couldn't outrun a turtle.

148
00:11:55,794 --> 00:11:57,266
2,400 bucks.

149
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,419
Sounds reasonable.

150
00:11:58,961 --> 00:12:02,485
Yeah, l believe that's the going rate
for old boats with weak engines.

151
00:12:02,578 --> 00:12:03,507
Right.

152
00:12:04,274 --> 00:12:06,421
You folks done much boating before?

153
00:12:09,682 --> 00:12:10,996
Hmm...

154
00:12:11,538 --> 00:12:14,005
l have.
l went to summer camp on Lake George,

155
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,871
and we had waterskiing, we...
Sometimes they let us steer the boat.

156
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:22,774
Well, this boat couldn't pull a turtle,
much less a skier.

157
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,469
What's with the turtles?

158
00:12:28,054 --> 00:12:31,096
Piloting a boat is a lot different
from driving a car.

159
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:34,007
But it, um, starts with a key, right?

160
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,752
Yeah. But it's got no brakes, for starters.

161
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:40,184
Neither did my last car. l think we'll be fine.

162
00:12:49,814 --> 00:12:50,807
How do l look?

163
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:54,073
Like a total dick. What'd that getup run you?

164
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,697
-Uh, not much. l bought it used.
-Ew.

165
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:02,586
Let's head up to the very beginning
of the river.

166
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,434
To the dam where the first lock is.
We'll start from there.

167
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,628
Okay, then.

168
00:13:45,723 --> 00:13:47,165
Don't drink the water.

169
00:13:55,517 --> 00:13:57,085
-Damn it!
-What?

170
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,557
lt's freezing!

171
00:13:58,653 --> 00:14:01,664
Really? Isn't that, uh, your...
Like, your thing?

172
00:14:02,045 --> 00:14:03,359
Doesn't your thing keep you warm?

173
00:14:03,454 --> 00:14:04,543
What thing?

174
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:06,239
Your outfit.

175
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:09,471
You know what? l think it's broken.
l'm getting out. It's too cold.

176
00:14:09,566 --> 00:14:12,641
Bullshit you're getting out!
Get used to it and start swimming.

177
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:15,041
-lt's freezing!
-Your idea, pal.

178
00:14:15,134 --> 00:14:16,992
We didn't come all this way
to get jerked around,

179
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,168
so tuck your cock in your ass
and get moving.

180
00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,891
Salvador Sanchez

181
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,628
Arrived and vanished

182
00:14:55,908 --> 00:14:58,277
Only 23

183
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,452
With so much speed

184
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:04,518
Owning the highway

185
00:15:13,764 --> 00:15:16,134
Mexico City

186
00:15:18,597 --> 00:15:20,904
Bred so many

187
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,775
But none quite like him

188
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:26,983
Sweet warrior

189
00:15:27,077 --> 00:15:31,530
Pure magic matador

190
00:15:40,295 --> 00:15:43,274
Pancho Villa

191
00:15:44,807 --> 00:15:46,889
Would never rest

192
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:51,691
Till 1925

193
00:15:52,071 --> 00:15:53,800
He closed his eyes

194
00:15:53,895 --> 00:16:00,109
Till Manila stars would rise

195
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:13,163
Maybe you should stop for the day.

196
00:16:17,578 --> 00:16:18,603
You think so?

197
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,555
Yes.

198
00:16:21,258 --> 00:16:22,218
Okay.

199
00:16:37,132 --> 00:16:38,251
Thanks.

200
00:16:42,925 --> 00:16:44,365
How much ground do you think we covered?

201
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:47,310
Maybe three miles.

202
00:16:48,749 --> 00:16:50,125
lt's not enough.

203
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:53,104
lt's only the first day.
Plus we got a late start, so...

204
00:16:53,869 --> 00:16:55,119
Gotta do better tomorrow.

205
00:16:55,245 --> 00:16:58,480
Maybe you could smoke in the water.
Save time on the smoking breaks.

206
00:16:58,573 --> 00:16:59,791
The cigarettes would get wet.

207
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:03,537
Not if you smoke the waterproof cigarettes.
They're all the rage with the kids today.

208
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:04,720
You guys are weird.

209
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,153
What do you mean ''you guys''?
He's the one that wants to swim all day.

210
00:17:07,246 --> 00:17:08,431
l don't want to swim all day.

211
00:17:08,878 --> 00:17:10,223
l want to swim the Hudson.
There's a difference.

212
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,523
lt's not like l'm going back and forth
in a pool all day, like Stevie Brennan.

213
00:17:14,864 --> 00:17:17,458
He was a mentally retarded boy
we went to school with.

214
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,639
Autistic.

215
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:21,907
Whatever.
That young man gave one hell of a blowjob.

216
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:24,882
-Mmm...
-You guys are truly demented.

217
00:17:25,232 --> 00:17:27,025
l don't know what you mean by that.

218
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:32,438
Now, let's head back to shore
so l can get a high colonic and a bite to eat.

219
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:58,389
It's okay.

220
00:18:07,475 --> 00:18:10,904
lt's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

221
00:18:14,165 --> 00:18:16,823
It's okay.

222
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:00,089
l haven't had sex in a year.

223
00:19:02,714 --> 00:19:03,771
No?

224
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:06,747
You should get married then.

225
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:11,806
l have sex like, God, almost six times a year.
It's hard to keep up.

226
00:19:12,411 --> 00:19:13,500
What's that about?

227
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:18,079
l don't know. Marriage, l guess.
Lots of little resentments.

228
00:19:23,643 --> 00:19:26,077
You're single.
You ought to be having sex all the time.

229
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:27,548
Get it while you can. You know?

230
00:19:29,051 --> 00:19:30,044
l guess.

231
00:19:30,332 --> 00:19:32,030
So what's this
haven't-had-sex-for-a-year business?

232
00:19:32,123 --> 00:19:34,687
A girl like you should be getting
some serious dick action.

233
00:19:36,188 --> 00:19:39,103
Yeah, l don't know.
l think l've had too many lovers already.

234
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,342
-Too many lovers?
-Yeah.

235
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:44,384
Not too much sex. But too many lovers.

236
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,414
Paul! Hey, Paul!

237
00:19:48,509 --> 00:19:50,463
You think you've slept with
too many women in your life?

238
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:51,550
Too many?

239
00:19:51,647 --> 00:19:53,280
Yeah. Think you had too many lovers?

240
00:19:53,374 --> 00:19:55,969
Oh, yeah. Way too many.

241
00:19:56,063 --> 00:19:57,761
Wish l could turn back the clock.

242
00:19:58,622 --> 00:20:00,704
Where do l sign up for
the too-many-lovers program?

243
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,394
-You don't understand.
-Yeah, apparently.

244
00:20:56,676 --> 00:21:01,065
l haven't slept in a sleeping bag
since camp. Inside a teepee.

245
00:21:02,405 --> 00:21:03,911
The famous camp.

246
00:21:04,356 --> 00:21:07,495
Waterskiing. Teepees.

247
00:21:08,581 --> 00:21:11,175
l wish l could go to camp now.

248
00:21:11,621 --> 00:21:12,774
lt was fun.

249
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,433
lt had all sorts of old-school activities.

250
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:18,185
Archery, water polo, capture the flag.

251
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:22,476
Oh! l would love to play water polo.

252
00:21:22,567 --> 00:21:26,282
Paul, how much would you pay
to play a real game of water polo?

253
00:21:29,191 --> 00:21:31,433
-Ten bucks?
-Wrong! Fifty bucks.

254
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,889
Wow. Water polo.

255
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,000
What didn't they have at that camp?

256
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:40,428
Adequate adult supervision. It was great.

257
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:44,106
Any lesbian experimentation going on?

258
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:46,218
A little.

259
00:21:52,873 --> 00:21:54,923
Why are you swimming down the river, Paul?

260
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:57,419
lt's a charity stunt.

261
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:00,844
Why is it so important to get there
by August 28th?

262
00:22:00,938 --> 00:22:02,315
He has Yankee tickets that night.

263
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,124
You don't remember what the 28th is?

264
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,454
lf you're talking about the day
you came out to me,

265
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:12,975
l'm pretty sure that, that was
the spring of senior year...

266
00:22:14,091 --> 00:22:16,012
And we never really celebrate that.

267
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:18,542
This stuff never stops, does it?

268
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:22,095
Nope.
The older l get, the more immature l get.

269
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:25,328
lt's an odd phenomenon.
It's not one l claim to understand.

270
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:28,623
Enough about me.
What's the deal with the 28th?

271
00:22:29,805 --> 00:22:31,086
Amy's anniversary.

272
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:36,464
August 28th is the fifth anniversary
of her death.

273
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,056
To prepare for the occasion,
l thought l'd do something interesting,

274
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,270
something unique,

275
00:22:40,366 --> 00:22:44,081
to distinguish myself in some small way
before l go.

276
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,768
Go where?

277
00:22:53,168 --> 00:22:54,865
lt's been five years.

278
00:22:55,695 --> 00:22:57,328
Motherfucker!

279
00:22:57,583 --> 00:22:58,607
What?

280
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:00,976
What?

281
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,298
Jeff!

282
00:23:21,107 --> 00:23:23,572
What's happening?
What... What was that about?

283
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:27,349
He's gonna kill himself
when we finish the swim.

284
00:23:29,779 --> 00:23:30,932
What's going on here? What...

285
00:23:31,026 --> 00:23:33,524
When Amy was killed, Paul was a wreck.

286
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:35,220
He was completely destroyed.

287
00:23:35,315 --> 00:23:38,358
Um... One night, after not being able
to reach him for a couple days,

288
00:23:38,452 --> 00:23:41,046
l went over to their apartment
to see how he was.

289
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,784
And when l got there, the door was open
and there was a suicide note on the desk.

290
00:23:45,973 --> 00:23:48,792
And l remember
we hung out on his roof sometimes,

291
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,165
so l run up there.

292
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:53,176
And there he was on the edge of the roof,

293
00:23:54,582 --> 00:23:56,342
-about to iump.
-Jesus.

294
00:23:56,694 --> 00:23:58,712
Yeah. But l start talking to him.

295
00:23:58,805 --> 00:24:00,181
We start talking
and l'm trying to convince him

296
00:24:00,277 --> 00:24:01,687
that he will feel better sometime.

297
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:05,657
Amy had iust died three months earlier
and he just had to give it some time.

298
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:09,017
And l told him to think about
the people that care about him.

299
00:24:09,111 --> 00:24:11,513
And what about our friendship?
That kind of thing.

300
00:24:11,606 --> 00:24:14,265
And l give him reason after reason
not to do it,

301
00:24:14,358 --> 00:24:16,986
not the least of which
is my car's parked below,

302
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:18,359
l don't want him to land on it.

303
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:19,415
Really?

304
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:22,041
No, but l did say that at one point
and he actually laughed.

305
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:25,691
l got a laugh out of him,
in spite of everything, and, uh,

306
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:28,441
just kept him talking.

307
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:31,961
Finally, after what seems like an hour,

308
00:24:32,985 --> 00:24:34,970
l say, ''l'll tell you what.

309
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:38,394
''You absolutely have to give this more time.

310
00:24:41,081 --> 00:24:42,746
''Give it five years,

311
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:46,460
''and if at the end of those five years
you still want to die,

312
00:24:46,555 --> 00:24:50,943
''l promise not only not to interfere,

313
00:24:51,034 --> 00:24:53,341
''l'll kick in for a pack of razor blades,

314
00:24:53,435 --> 00:24:57,951
''and l'll give a eulogy at your funeral,
telling 'em you did the right thing for you,

315
00:24:58,043 --> 00:25:00,862
''and l'll defend your decision
to anybody who has a problem with it.''

316
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:05,918
But he didn't want to wait five years.
He didn't want to wait five minutes.

317
00:25:06,011 --> 00:25:08,990
Thing is, he would've asked for
the exact same thing

318
00:25:09,083 --> 00:25:11,774
if the situation was reversed,
to give it more time.

319
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:15,808
And when he realized that, l knew l had him.
l knew he wasn't going to jump.

320
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,185
We actually shook hands on it,
and he seemed to gradually get better.

321
00:25:22,268 --> 00:25:25,953
And after a couple years,
l put it in the back of my mind,

322
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:28,960
and, uh, kind of forgot about it,

323
00:25:30,302 --> 00:25:32,319
until about two minutes ago.

324
00:25:33,246 --> 00:25:35,809
So, it's five years later and, uh...

325
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:38,688
The time is actually here,

326
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,729
and he still wants to die.

327
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,026
Hi.

328
00:26:27,011 --> 00:26:28,004
Hi.

329
00:26:32,069 --> 00:26:33,445
Good morning.

330
00:26:37,861 --> 00:26:39,045
Where'd you get that?

331
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,849
A little store up there.
l got one for Jeff, too, and a Coke for you.

332
00:26:43,941 --> 00:26:47,881
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

333
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,153
l also found out
we're camping on private property.

334
00:26:55,078 --> 00:26:57,063
Well, we're private people.

335
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:11,146
Rise and shine, captain.
We got swimming to do.

336
00:27:11,623 --> 00:27:12,999
The missus brought you some coffee.

337
00:27:13,095 --> 00:27:14,409
Really?

338
00:27:15,687 --> 00:27:16,744
Fantastic.

339
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:20,715
Need to do six miles today, at least.
You guys up for that?

340
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:23,562
Considering all we have to do is
sit in the boat drinking Mai Tais

341
00:27:23,656 --> 00:27:28,782
while you do the actual swimming,
l'd say, yeah, l think we can swing it.

342
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:21,841
l can't believe we're iust...
We're just gonna go along like this?

343
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:23,118
What would you prefer we do?

344
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:26,577
Stop the trip. Take him to a hospital.
Get him committed or something.

345
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:31,091
lf we stop the trip and say,
''No, we're not going along with this,''

346
00:28:31,183 --> 00:28:32,111
what's that going to accomplish?

347
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:34,673
He wants to kill himself, he'll find a way.
Maybe sooner rather than later.

348
00:28:34,766 --> 00:28:36,048
You guys talking about me?

349
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:37,071
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

350
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:39,024
Please don't.

351
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:40,112
Okay.

352
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,873
We'll chat about the weather instead.

353
00:28:41,968 --> 00:28:44,209
Pretty nice day, huh?
Yeah. How's the water?

354
00:28:44,304 --> 00:28:45,585
Not as bad as yesterday.

355
00:28:45,681 --> 00:28:47,700
Ah! Probably getting used to it.
Probably.

356
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:49,906
Water's always freezing
when you first get in.

357
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,858
Ain't that the truth.

358
00:28:51,952 --> 00:28:54,515
Well, keep on trucking.

359
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,042
Will do, buddy.

360
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:01,619
l don't know
what the hell to do, okay?

361
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:05,044
l don't know what to do.

362
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:11,767
lf he kills himself,
maybe he'll give me his television.

363
00:29:12,947 --> 00:29:14,740
lt's got a huge screen.

364
00:31:16,606 --> 00:31:18,400
What's he swimming for?

365
00:31:18,494 --> 00:31:19,903
Just for fun.

366
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:21,792
Don't know how clean the water is.

367
00:31:21,886 --> 00:31:24,032
There's a freshwater lake
a few miles inland.

368
00:31:24,127 --> 00:31:27,394
l don't think
pollution's a top priority of his.

369
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:41,473
Let's get some hot dogs.

370
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,417
Damn it!

371
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:52,899
All right.

372
00:31:56,834 --> 00:31:58,596
Put that around there.

373
00:32:19,204 --> 00:32:20,870
We're looking for hot dogs.

374
00:32:20,964 --> 00:32:22,084
l don't have any.

375
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,812
Fair enough.

376
00:32:24,228 --> 00:32:25,638
Anybody know where we can
get something to eat?

377
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,231
Town's about a quarter-mile down the road.

378
00:32:28,325 --> 00:32:30,022
Perry's has hot dogs.

379
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,487
-No, they don't.
-Yeah, they do.

380
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:35,144
-They're iust not on the menu.
-Yeah, you have to ask for 'em.

381
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:36,518
Bullshit!

382
00:32:36,613 --> 00:32:38,727
It's true. You just have to ask for 'em.

383
00:32:38,823 --> 00:32:41,416
-Who told you that?
-Nobody told me. l just know.

384
00:32:41,509 --> 00:32:44,585
Don't worry, we'll get to the bottom of it.

385
00:32:44,998 --> 00:32:46,951
Knock some heads together, if we have to.

386
00:32:47,046 --> 00:32:49,801
Mmm-hmm.
Will you keep an eye on her for me?

387
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:57,705
Mmm! Mmm!

388
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:03,019
l saw this thing on TV once,
a special about the death penalty,

389
00:33:03,112 --> 00:33:06,796
and they were talking about
prisoners' last meals, and this...

390
00:33:06,888 --> 00:33:12,204
This chaplain was saying
in his 30 years at Sing Sing,

391
00:33:12,296 --> 00:33:14,635
never once did he actually see
a prisoner eat his last meal.

392
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:17,419
They always ended up
giving it to the other prisoners.

393
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:18,986
We'll be passing Sing Sing.

394
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:21,389
l know. That's why l mentioned it.

395
00:33:24,362 --> 00:33:26,155
Why did you mention it?

396
00:33:26,698 --> 00:33:31,054
Well, how can you be eating so happily
if you know you're going to die soon?

397
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:35,310
Well, A, this isn't my last meal,

398
00:33:37,163 --> 00:33:38,957
B, l'm hungry, and C, l love food.

399
00:33:39,723 --> 00:33:43,183
Okay. Good. You love food.

400
00:33:43,277 --> 00:33:45,262
That... Isn't that one reason
not to kill yourself, right there?

401
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,669
l mean, not to mention
the millions of other reasons.

402
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:50,223
l mean, you were like a little kid
when we got those donuts on the drive up.

403
00:33:50,605 --> 00:33:52,782
l'm sure they'll have donuts in heaven.

404
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:54,896
-What?
-l'm sure they'll have donuts in heaven.

405
00:33:54,989 --> 00:33:57,583
-They have donuts in heaven.
-Right.

406
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:01,744
l mean, if one believes in the concept
of heaven as a paradise,

407
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:04,463
not really a stretch to believe
they have donuts there.

408
00:34:04,558 --> 00:34:05,486
-Right.
-Well, A,

409
00:34:05,582 --> 00:34:07,216
even if they do have donuts in heaven,

410
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,361
and l can't believe l'm actually
discussing these issues seriously,

411
00:34:09,454 --> 00:34:11,728
what about B,
which is the fact that most people

412
00:34:11,822 --> 00:34:13,841
don't believe suicides go to heaven,
they go to hell?

413
00:34:13,936 --> 00:34:16,849
l don't believe in hell, or that suicides
would necessarily end up there.

414
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:20,337
l'm not saying l believe that either
but l'm certainly not sure there's a heaven.

415
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:21,553
Me neither.

416
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:24,691
Yet you're sure there's donuts there,
if it does exist?

417
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:25,841
Willing to find out.

418
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,169
Paul, you've got to get some therapy.
You can't just...

419
00:34:29,265 --> 00:34:30,450
l tried therapy, Liz.

420
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:34,932
All kinds. Groups, Prozac, Zoloft.

421
00:34:36,528 --> 00:34:37,713
l tried praying

422
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:41,074
and then one day l just stopped.

423
00:34:41,778 --> 00:34:42,770
Why?

424
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:47,923
Because Amy and the baby were still dead.

425
00:34:51,315 --> 00:34:52,916
Okay. l understand that.

426
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:58,328
But that doesn't mean that
you can't find a way to go on, somehow.

427
00:34:58,835 --> 00:35:04,408
Lots of people have suffered
terrible tragedies and horrific losses

428
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:08,536
and continued with their lives.
They found a way to go on.

429
00:35:09,396 --> 00:35:10,965
Not all of them.
Some of them killed themselves.

430
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,360
But most do go on, Paul. They find a way.

431
00:35:15,605 --> 00:35:16,628
Maybe they were stronger than me,

432
00:35:16,724 --> 00:35:18,774
but it was their choice to go on
and not someone else's.

433
00:35:18,868 --> 00:35:22,359
l'm sorry, but, like, grief
or despair or whatever

434
00:35:22,485 --> 00:35:26,744
is iust not a good reason to kill...
To commit suicide. It's just not.

435
00:35:26,838 --> 00:35:28,311
Not a good enough reason for you, you mean.

436
00:35:28,406 --> 00:35:31,738
lt's not a good enough reason for anyone!
It's selfish to kill yourself.

437
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,463
lt's a hostile act.

438
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:37,402
l don't have any siblings,
my parents are dead,

439
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,922
my wife and child are dead,
so why can't l join my family?

440
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,872
What about Jeff?
What about your other friends?

441
00:35:43,767 --> 00:35:46,618
Why should l be forced
to stay alive for them?

442
00:35:47,032 --> 00:35:51,292
l wouldn't stop Jeff from killing himself,
if that's truly what he wanted to do.

443
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,474
You want to kill yourself,
it's your absolute right.

444
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:59,195
Thanks. But who would drive the boat?

445
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:02,075
Good point. Hang in there, buddy.
Things will start looking up.

446
00:36:02,168 --> 00:36:03,737
You're an asshole.

447
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:05,274
And you're an idiot.

448
00:36:06,553 --> 00:36:07,866
What'd l do?

449
00:36:30,172 --> 00:36:33,982
l'm pretty sure ''slack tide'' means... It's like...

450
00:36:35,165 --> 00:36:38,752
Slack. It's calm. It's not moving either way.

451
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:42,881
Remember, the Hudson is an estuary
where the water flows in, then flows out.

452
00:36:42,972 --> 00:36:45,695
Right, so ideally you want
to be swimming at ebb tide, right?

453
00:36:45,788 --> 00:36:49,856
Maximum ebb best of all, where you'd be
just coasting along practically.

454
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:53,152
l know, so why was l fighting tides
half the morning?

455
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:55,999
l don't know how to read the chart.

456
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:04,161
Well, we were beginning to think
you killed yourself.

457
00:37:07,551 --> 00:37:08,737
You okay?

458
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:10,560
Went window shopping.

459
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:56,646
l'm cold and sore and everything aches.

460
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,846
What do you care?
You'll be dead soon anyway.

461
00:38:16,645 --> 00:38:20,169
Cigarettes don't help with
your circulation, you know?

462
00:38:20,454 --> 00:38:22,407
What do l care? l'll be dead soon anyway.

463
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:23,910
Douché.

464
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:28,297
Maybe we should take tomorrow off.
Rest a day.

465
00:38:29,126 --> 00:38:30,408
We could...

466
00:38:31,207 --> 00:38:34,602
l don't know,
take a factory tour or something.

467
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:35,911
See where plastic's made.

468
00:38:36,008 --> 00:38:37,128
Can't fall behind.

469
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:40,265
Then we'll motor down the river
for a few miles at the end of the day

470
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:42,314
and nobody will know the difference.

471
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:45,066
l'll know the difference.
l want to do this right.

472
00:38:46,728 --> 00:38:49,129
l'd like to accomplish
this one thing in my life.

473
00:38:51,752 --> 00:38:54,827
l want to actually do something
instead of just talking about doing things.

474
00:38:54,921 --> 00:38:56,619
You know what l mean?

475
00:39:06,186 --> 00:39:07,948
Let's get a milkshake.

476
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,685
This guy really didn't get enough time
in the mixer.

477
00:39:12,779 --> 00:39:14,828
Neither of them, Mom. Right.

478
00:39:16,235 --> 00:39:17,228
Yes.

479
00:39:18,283 --> 00:39:19,692
Maybe tomorrow.
When are we getting there?

480
00:39:19,787 --> 00:39:20,876
When do you think we'll get there?

481
00:39:20,971 --> 00:39:23,822
-Uh, hard to say.
-We'll be there tomorrow afternoon.

482
00:39:23,915 --> 00:39:25,677
- Probably tomorrow.
-l want to do 10 miles tomorrow.

483
00:39:25,771 --> 00:39:26,828
-No.
-Okay.

484
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:29,230
-l'm serious. l want to do 10 miles.
-l heard you the first time.

485
00:39:30,285 --> 00:39:32,270
Neither of them, Mom! Okay?

486
00:39:33,548 --> 00:39:36,207
Uh, sometime tomorrow afternoon, probably.

487
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:40,591
Will Pasthule be there?

488
00:39:41,966 --> 00:39:44,272
l'm just asking. Suzanne?

489
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,912
All right, well, we'll all have dinner. Okay.

490
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,529
Okay. Okay!

491
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,239
Bye.

492
00:39:59,151 --> 00:40:01,329
All set. She's looking forward to it.

493
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:04,880
Faggots!

494
00:40:39,763 --> 00:40:41,140
Good morning.

495
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:44,436
Hey, did you sleep okay?

496
00:40:46,709 --> 00:40:47,958
Yeah.

497
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:53,206
We need to get going.
The current's really moving.

498
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:58,455
Maximum ebb, people!
Let's go while we got it!

499
00:41:01,942 --> 00:41:03,895
He's out of his mind!

500
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:06,937
No kidding.
And we're going right along with it.

501
00:41:08,406 --> 00:41:10,039
l made him a promise.

502
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:13,016
-You don't have to honor it.
- Says who? You?

503
00:41:13,142 --> 00:41:15,608
What good is giving your word
to a friend if you don't plan on keeping it?

504
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:31,161
-Shit!

505
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:03,163
You all right?

506
00:42:05,532 --> 00:42:06,972
Just swimming down the river.

507
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,925
What do you mean?

508
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:11,453
l'm swimming down to the Verrazano Bridge.

509
00:42:11,548 --> 00:42:14,142
Verrazano Bridge? It's like 90 miles.

510
00:42:14,812 --> 00:42:17,311
Not all at once. You know, day by day.

511
00:42:19,388 --> 00:42:20,445
Everything okay?

512
00:42:22,908 --> 00:42:24,607
Everything okay here?

513
00:42:28,157 --> 00:42:29,823
l'm fine. Really.

514
00:42:30,302 --> 00:42:34,273
He wants to swim the entire river.
It's one of those, uh, endurance things.

515
00:42:34,365 --> 00:42:38,113
Kind of, like, that Iditarod dog sled race
they have in Alaska.

516
00:42:39,742 --> 00:42:41,280
Except there's no other racers.

517
00:42:42,623 --> 00:42:43,551
Right.

518
00:42:44,414 --> 00:42:45,439
You got a permit for this?

519
00:42:48,415 --> 00:42:49,375
No.

520
00:42:49,951 --> 00:42:51,136
Do l need one?

521
00:42:54,527 --> 00:42:55,744
Just be careful, okay?

522
00:42:57,056 --> 00:42:58,306
Thank you.

523
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,621
-Do you know what we're eating tonight?
-Nope. My aunt will be making dinner.

524
00:43:15,714 --> 00:43:19,589
-There'll be an aunt there?
-Yep. My cousin, also. The whole gang.

525
00:43:20,577 --> 00:43:23,332
You don't sound too enthused.
You sure you want to do this?

526
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:26,181
We can always stay at a motel, if you want.

527
00:43:26,275 --> 00:43:27,395
We'll be fine.

528
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:31,491
Fuck me!

529
00:43:32,196 --> 00:43:35,527
What are the chances your mother
will have homemade sticky buns

530
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,118
-waiting for us at the house?
-Near zero.

531
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:41,639
-What are the chances your stepfather will...
-Mother's boyfriend!

532
00:43:41,732 --> 00:43:45,384
What are the chances your mother's
boyfriend will commit homosexual rape

533
00:43:45,477 --> 00:43:46,597
upon my person?

534
00:43:50,053 --> 00:43:51,334
Your taxi's here!

535
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:54,886
Hi, Mom!

536
00:43:55,525 --> 00:44:00,202
Now, that one was built by a prosperous
Dutch merchant in the 1800s.

537
00:44:00,357 --> 00:44:02,375
Made an absolute fortune in imports.

538
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:08,395
Unfortunately, his grandson frittered it all
away and it had to be sold a few years back.

539
00:44:08,486 --> 00:44:10,567
-That's too bad.
-Yes, a shame.

540
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,121
You used to play with his grandson, Liz.
Do you remember?

541
00:44:14,214 --> 00:44:17,001
We used to smoke pot by the river
in high school, if that's what you mean.

542
00:44:17,095 --> 00:44:18,793
Oh, don't be sassy!

543
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,674
And what about you, Seth?
What does your family do?

544
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:24,905
-Jeff.
-What?

545
00:44:25,576 --> 00:44:26,985
-Jeff.
-Jeff.

546
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:29,930
Forgive me, Jeff.
So what does your family do?

547
00:44:30,857 --> 00:44:35,598
My mother's a college professor, retired,
and my father is a physician.

548
00:44:35,689 --> 00:44:39,180
Oh! A doctor. That must've come in handy
when you got the flu.

549
00:44:39,369 --> 00:44:43,309
Ha! Actually, he was the kind of guy
who was so wrapped up in his work

550
00:44:43,401 --> 00:44:45,355
and research and whatever else,

551
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,622
you could be walking around the house
with a bloody stump and he wouldn't notice.

552
00:44:49,803 --> 00:44:54,543
My aunt had a leg amputated
and believe me, Jeff, you'd notice.

553
00:44:55,531 --> 00:44:58,510
Right. l mean, he probably would have
noticed something like that.

554
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,204
And what do you do?

555
00:45:00,459 --> 00:45:02,284
Actor. Bartender.

556
00:45:06,156 --> 00:45:07,309
Et vous?

557
00:45:09,036 --> 00:45:10,189
Et vous?

558
00:45:10,701 --> 00:45:14,063
Hey! Hello? What's your background?

559
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:17,424
My father was a lawyer.
My mother was a homemaker.

560
00:45:18,157 --> 00:45:19,247
They both died.

561
00:45:19,628 --> 00:45:22,319
Aw, lord. Plane crash?

562
00:45:22,413 --> 00:45:24,815
No, no. Cancer. Natural causes.

563
00:45:25,486 --> 00:45:27,055
They both had good lives.

564
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,360
Thank goodness for small favors, huh?

565
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:30,959
Yeah.

566
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:32,880
That house is amazing.

567
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:34,992
The Williams.

568
00:45:35,087 --> 00:45:38,675
More divorce and alcoholism in that family
than l care to discuss.

569
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:40,112
Troubled family, huh?

570
00:45:40,558 --> 00:45:42,544
l don't want to discuss it. Please.

571
00:45:43,503 --> 00:45:46,097
The youngest is in jail, if you can believe it.

572
00:45:46,608 --> 00:45:49,523
And the middle one is a... A gay.

573
00:45:52,017 --> 00:45:54,451
Oh, look at that one. That is huge!

574
00:45:54,576 --> 00:45:57,780
The Vanderhooks.
Their money came from the railroads.

575
00:45:57,873 --> 00:45:59,441
They had nine children.

576
00:46:00,081 --> 00:46:01,105
Seven.

577
00:46:01,201 --> 00:46:05,077
Well, l never counted.
Mostly boys, it seemed.

578
00:46:05,169 --> 00:46:08,789
And poor Emily.
Oh, she died so tragically young.

579
00:46:09,681 --> 00:46:14,166
Not that the father seemed to mind.
No, he had a new wife by the end of the year.

580
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:16,885
She couldn't have been a day over 21.

581
00:46:17,427 --> 00:46:19,572
She did not wear a bra.

582
00:46:22,386 --> 00:46:23,444
You think that's funny?

583
00:46:24,339 --> 00:46:28,119
Not wearing a bra is ha-ha funny?

584
00:46:28,404 --> 00:46:30,806
No, not the lack of bra, in and of itself, no.

585
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:34,038
Well, let me tell you,
there was nothing funny about it.

586
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:38,105
Teenage wife,
prancing around in front of 12 boys

587
00:46:38,197 --> 00:46:40,470
with no bra on all day!

588
00:46:56,757 --> 00:46:58,968
So when does school start, dear?

589
00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:01,625
The Wednesday after Labor Day.

590
00:47:02,647 --> 00:47:05,114
l heard they were making
the children in New York City

591
00:47:05,206 --> 00:47:06,840
start school in August these days,

592
00:47:06,935 --> 00:47:10,298
because they were so hopelessly
behind in their studies.

593
00:47:11,544 --> 00:47:13,146
-lt's not true.
-Hmm.

594
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,699
Do you think they should start in August?
Or even July?

595
00:47:17,111 --> 00:47:19,897
Right, like she's really going to be
in favor of teaching all summer.

596
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:23,963
Paul, we never did get to what it is you do.

597
00:47:24,537 --> 00:47:27,100
That is, when you're not
swimming the Amazon,

598
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:29,339
or crossing the Great Ponds.

599
00:47:30,041 --> 00:47:32,700
l've been writing for a business magazine.

600
00:47:32,794 --> 00:47:37,631
Mostly personal investments,
money markets, IRAs, that kind of thing.

601
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:40,380
That sounds like a drag.

602
00:47:40,475 --> 00:47:42,011
Suzanne...

603
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:45,918
No. Actually, she's right. It's... It isn't fun.

604
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:48,412
Well, maybe this little vacation

605
00:47:48,507 --> 00:47:52,479
will re-energize you and you can go back
to work with a whole new attitude.

606
00:47:53,019 --> 00:47:55,999
Not that l would want to write
a financial column.

607
00:47:56,316 --> 00:47:57,853
Or even read one.

608
00:47:58,844 --> 00:48:01,631
-l'm not going back to work.
- No?

609
00:48:01,948 --> 00:48:05,150
Oh? Well, what's next?
Riding a bicycle to the Yukon?

610
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:08,350
Uh...

611
00:48:10,525 --> 00:48:11,965
Nothing, really.

612
00:48:12,477 --> 00:48:14,143
Nothing?
Not really.

613
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:18,591
People don't just do nothing, Paul.

614
00:48:19,421 --> 00:48:21,502
You have to do something.

615
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,080
Well, actually, if you really want to know,
l'm going to kill myself.

616
00:48:29,311 --> 00:48:30,977
He's joking. He's...

617
00:48:31,295 --> 00:48:33,633
These guys have a real
deadpan sense of humor.

618
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:34,815
Bedpan?

619
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:36,257
Deadpan.

620
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,279
Bedpan, too.

621
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,944
Oh, l'm not joking.

622
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,468
But if you'd rather not discuss it, which is
more than fine with me, let's not.

623
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,097
Please. Let's do.

624
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:49,862
What is all this nonsense
about killing yourself?

625
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,170
Why?

626
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,642
Because l've lived my life.

627
00:48:52,993 --> 00:48:55,652
Uh-huh. You're all of 21 years old!

628
00:48:56,258 --> 00:48:57,763
Thirty-five, actually.

629
00:48:57,857 --> 00:49:02,246
Well, l don't care if you're 36.
It's still a poor reason to commit suicide.

630
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:06,885
She's right, Paul.
Suicide is not the answer to anything.

631
00:49:06,978 --> 00:49:08,804
Particularly growing older.

632
00:49:08,931 --> 00:49:10,467
lf it was, we'd all be dead.

633
00:49:11,779 --> 00:49:16,935
Look, l'm way over 21,
and you don't see me committing suicide.

634
00:49:17,251 --> 00:49:19,750
l'm no spring chicken either,
and l'm still here.

635
00:49:20,484 --> 00:49:23,142
You know what? l'm...
l'm sorry l brought this up.

636
00:49:23,588 --> 00:49:24,677
l'm sorry.

637
00:49:24,772 --> 00:49:26,726
Good luck closing that barn door.

638
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:30,824
lt actually was a ioke, okay?
l'm not going to kill myself.

639
00:49:30,918 --> 00:49:36,491
l'm sorry l said that. l'm sorry.
Um... l was just making conversation.

640
00:49:40,773 --> 00:49:42,535
l do not like those boys.

641
00:49:43,429 --> 00:49:44,806
Which one are you dating?

642
00:49:44,902 --> 00:49:47,177
l'm not dating either of them, Mom.

643
00:49:47,909 --> 00:49:52,330
l iust hate to see you throw yourself into
the arms of the first man who smiles at you

644
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,728
just because you're getting older.

645
00:49:55,174 --> 00:49:56,840
Do yourself a favor.

646
00:49:57,063 --> 00:50:01,034
Forget about marriage and children.
It's not worth the sacrifice.

647
00:50:02,023 --> 00:50:04,041
-Thanks.
-Oh, stop with that!

648
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:06,185
You know what l'm saying.

649
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:09,675
You gotta look out for number one,
which is you,

650
00:50:10,473 --> 00:50:11,849
not some man.

651
00:50:12,904 --> 00:50:14,795
l'll tell you something.

652
00:50:15,336 --> 00:50:18,667
l don't give Pasthule a thing, until l got my...

653
00:50:19,818 --> 00:50:21,386
You know what.

654
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:23,596
l really don't want to discuss this.

655
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:28,301
Uh, yeah, l think she does some good work
with the right roles.

656
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:31,148
l didn't say she was better than you,

657
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:34,092
just she does what she does.

658
00:50:35,722 --> 00:50:38,637
And no, l don't think she's prettier than you.

659
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:42,382
Well, yeah, she's younger.
l mean, that's just a fact.

660
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:43,563
Right.

661
00:50:44,139 --> 00:50:45,260
No, she's not.

662
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:47,309
We'll talk about this when l get home, okay?

663
00:50:47,404 --> 00:50:49,357
Yes, l gotta get off the phone.

664
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:54,032
'Cause it's not polite to talk for an hour
on the phone at someone's house.

665
00:50:54,125 --> 00:50:55,566
Yeah, whatever, 20 minutes.

666
00:50:56,109 --> 00:50:57,615
Yes, definitely.

667
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:00,527
Uh, no, nothing's wrong.

668
00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:04,241
l don't know what you perceive in my voice,
but everything's fine.

669
00:51:04,334 --> 00:51:06,671
l'll call you soon. Bye.

670
00:51:07,854 --> 00:51:09,391
High maintenance!

671
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:17,426
So you're an actor, huh?

672
00:51:18,895 --> 00:51:20,913
Have l seen you in anything?

673
00:51:22,063 --> 00:51:24,625
Other than the dining room during dinner?
l doubt it.

674
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,689
Unless you happened to be living
in the Phoenix-Scottsdale area

675
00:51:28,783 --> 00:51:31,314
a few years back,
where you would certainly recognize me

676
00:51:31,408 --> 00:51:34,387
from the Lem's Auto Insurance ad

677
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:37,426
as the poor bastard
who slams his car into a hearse.

678
00:51:37,521 --> 00:51:38,737
lt ran all the time.

679
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,010
l think l missed that one.

680
00:51:41,105 --> 00:51:42,771
Well, l have it on tape.

681
00:51:42,865 --> 00:51:47,861
Be happy to send it to you.
l could even autograph the, uh, tape sleeve.

682
00:51:49,297 --> 00:51:51,859
You know that self-deprecating humor
is usually used

683
00:51:51,954 --> 00:51:55,926
as a defense mechanism for those
with actual low self-esteem, right?

684
00:51:56,306 --> 00:51:57,843
That would be me.

685
00:51:57,970 --> 00:52:00,276
Which doesn't mean it isn't funny.

686
00:52:01,234 --> 00:52:02,355
Thanks.

687
00:52:03,634 --> 00:52:05,620
But what l'm really good at

688
00:52:07,058 --> 00:52:08,468
is bartending.

689
00:52:10,803 --> 00:52:13,494
Hmm, someone's gotta make the drinks, huh?

690
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:16,822
Yeah, l guess so.

691
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:21,974
So, uh...

692
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:26,486
What do you study in college?

693
00:52:26,582 --> 00:52:28,279
Actually, l'm a drama major.

694
00:52:29,205 --> 00:52:30,807
Another actor.

695
00:52:30,902 --> 00:52:33,176
No, l'm just kidding. l'm pre-med.

696
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,415
Really? So, you want to be a doctor?

697
00:52:35,509 --> 00:52:37,367
No. l'm fucking with you.

698
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:43,227
l'm iust a regular liberal arts,
nothing special, no-real-skills-learned major.

699
00:52:44,695 --> 00:52:46,520
You'll make a great temp someday.

700
00:52:46,615 --> 00:52:47,865
Thank you.

701
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:55,258
So, um, your friend in there,

702
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:58,363
he sounded serious about
wanting to kill himself.

703
00:52:59,193 --> 00:53:00,122
He is.

704
00:53:01,784 --> 00:53:04,956
Hmm, interesting. It's his life.

705
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,938
You think so?

706
00:53:07,737 --> 00:53:09,370
No, it's your life.

707
00:53:16,697 --> 00:53:18,265
Let's take a walk.

708
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:20,540
Where to?

709
00:53:22,714 --> 00:53:24,027
l don't know.

710
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:35,677
l'm gonna go for a walk.

711
00:53:36,988 --> 00:53:38,909
Come join me, if you like.

712
00:53:50,652 --> 00:53:50,652
And that's when l knew, right then and there,
that l could never eat another tomato!

713
00:53:50,877 --> 00:53:56,098
And that's when l knew, right then and there,
that l could never eat another tomato!

714
00:53:58,494 --> 00:54:01,152
She's not on the porch.
Tell her she'll just have to walk home.

715
00:54:01,246 --> 00:54:04,962
Oh, dear, l'm not going to tell her anything.
l'm going to bed.

716
00:54:05,182 --> 00:54:08,033
Why don't you pin a note to Pasthule's shirt?

717
00:54:08,384 --> 00:54:10,049
-Nice meeting you, Paul.
-Good night.

718
00:54:10,142 --> 00:54:12,418
Good night, Aunt Karen.
We'll tell Suzanne you left.

719
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:15,170
No, let her figure it out the hard way.

720
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,658
Let's roll him for his billfold.

721
00:54:22,753 --> 00:54:24,193
lf only he had one.

722
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,314
God, l'm sorry l brought you here.

723
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,291
l'm sorry l brought me here.

724
00:54:32,386 --> 00:54:35,043
-Why?
-My family is weird.

725
00:54:36,384 --> 00:54:37,505
All families are weird.

726
00:54:40,034 --> 00:54:41,602
Do you miss yours?

727
00:54:42,978 --> 00:54:44,227
Of course.

728
00:54:46,626 --> 00:54:48,163
They good to you?

729
00:54:52,162 --> 00:54:54,051
Amy was great.

730
00:54:55,234 --> 00:54:56,868
And the baby, well...

731
00:54:57,763 --> 00:55:00,901
Um, l wasn't... l wasn't talking about...

732
00:55:01,636 --> 00:55:03,974
l was talking about your parents.
Wow, l'm sorry.

733
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:05,189
Oh, no.

734
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,349
Of course.

735
00:55:10,661 --> 00:55:12,198
l miss them, too.

736
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:34,248
l want you to taste me.

737
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,192
l want you to taste me
and then l want you to fuck me.

738
00:55:37,287 --> 00:55:39,400
Wanna taste me? Do you wanna fuck me?

739
00:55:44,393 --> 00:55:45,578
Taste me.

740
00:57:33,779 --> 00:57:34,963
Hi.

741
00:57:37,138 --> 00:57:38,514
Good morning.

742
00:57:41,778 --> 00:57:42,771
Wow.

743
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:44,564
Mmm.

744
00:57:55,475 --> 00:57:56,981
What time is it?

745
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:59,895
Um, almost 11:00.

746
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:03,253
Really?

747
00:58:04,212 --> 00:58:05,718
Yeah.

748
00:58:09,302 --> 00:58:10,967
We should get going.

749
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,926
Do you think there's any Cokes in the house?

750
00:58:16,342 --> 00:58:17,334
Probably Pepsi.

751
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:18,487
Pepsi?

752
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:20,311
What kind of flophouse
is your mother running here?

753
00:58:27,127 --> 00:58:28,280
Bonjour.

754
00:58:30,903 --> 00:58:32,472
l'm such an idiot!

755
00:58:33,336 --> 00:58:34,329
Yup.

756
00:58:37,145 --> 00:58:38,426
How was it?

757
00:58:42,456 --> 00:58:44,026
She's kinda nutty.

758
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,618
ln a good way or a bad way?

759
00:58:46,713 --> 00:58:48,249
A little of both.

760
00:58:52,889 --> 00:58:55,003
Was our absence remarked upon?

761
00:58:55,705 --> 00:58:57,339
Pasthule went nuts.

762
00:58:57,977 --> 00:58:59,291
ls that, that guy's name?

763
00:59:00,506 --> 00:59:01,882
l don't know.

764
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:06,493
Yeah, he nodded off.
Mom went to bed, the aunt went home.

765
00:59:06,586 --> 00:59:09,724
-And what'd you guys do?
-Nothing. Just went to bed.

766
00:59:20,796 --> 00:59:25,088
You're really going back into that water
and swim all the way to New York?

767
00:59:26,236 --> 00:59:28,190
Or are you just gooing on me?

768
00:59:29,533 --> 00:59:30,461
Goofing.

769
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:33,856
-What?
-The word you mean, it's... It's goofing.

770
00:59:33,950 --> 00:59:38,048
Oh, who cares what the word is, dear?
l'm asking him a question.

771
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:42,081
Yes, l'm going to swim
all the way to New York.

772
00:59:42,591 --> 00:59:44,127
What do you do when you finish?

773
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:48,416
Look for a new job, l guess.

774
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:49,726
There you go!

775
00:59:50,207 --> 00:59:53,249
Can't hurt to see what's out there,
now, can it?

776
00:59:53,343 --> 00:59:54,272
Nope.

777
00:59:54,944 --> 00:59:56,480
Keep my options open.

778
00:59:58,143 --> 00:59:59,905
Ah, there's Renny Van Cort.

779
01:00:00,352 --> 01:00:02,562
The sorrow that man has known.

780
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,196
Wish l could have grabbed
a shower this morning.

781
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:51,399
There's my favorite

782
01:00:56,293 --> 01:00:58,792
Rollercoaster

783
01:01:03,238 --> 01:01:09,003
Next to the blue water

784
01:01:18,535 --> 01:01:21,290
There's the sun

785
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:28,937
Going down

786
01:01:33,576 --> 01:01:38,926
Creating that fluorescent glow

787
01:01:47,817 --> 01:01:54,512
Reminding me I'll never be able

788
01:02:03,691 --> 01:02:06,862
To relive this day

789
01:02:10,668 --> 01:02:13,806
Except in memory

790
01:02:34,446 --> 01:02:38,097
There's those big

791
01:02:41,935 --> 01:02:45,362
Barking fish

792
01:02:49,648 --> 01:02:54,646
ln the concrete stream

793
01:03:02,385 --> 01:03:06,004
But where's Dad?

794
01:03:09,521 --> 01:03:15,095
And where is Mom?

795
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,958
Looks like from here on out

796
01:03:28,915 --> 01:03:32,310
lt's me and you

797
01:03:38,678 --> 01:03:43,097
Looks like from here on out

798
01:03:43,188 --> 01:03:45,013
lt's iust me and you

799
01:03:49,238 --> 01:03:51,609
Can l sleep with you tonight?

800
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:54,488
Tie our sleeping bags together or something?

801
01:03:55,477 --> 01:03:57,463
What are we gonna tell him?

802
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:05,881
Don't worry about it.
l know how to handle it.

803
01:04:06,038 --> 01:04:09,306
Liz and l are shacking up tonight.
You're on your own.

804
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,897
When did this develop?
l wasn't on the phone that long.

805
01:04:11,991 --> 01:04:13,272
Last night.

806
01:04:14,327 --> 01:04:16,729
Christ!
It was one big orgy back at the house, huh?

807
01:04:18,424 --> 01:04:20,987
She knows. l can hear it in her voice,
she knows.

808
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:24,411
l cannot believe you slept with Suzanne.
She's 20 years old.

809
01:04:24,504 --> 01:04:26,138
l didn't find that part to be a problem.

810
01:04:26,232 --> 01:04:28,122
What are you going to do?

811
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:31,067
-l might not go home.
-What?

812
01:04:31,545 --> 01:04:33,210
l might not go home.

813
01:04:34,585 --> 01:04:36,699
l'm tired of living like this.

814
01:04:37,657 --> 01:04:38,778
Oh, man.

815
01:04:40,314 --> 01:04:41,851
l feel so drained.

816
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:45,595
And l do not want to do this anymore.

817
01:04:45,754 --> 01:04:47,324
-But you need to.
-What?

818
01:04:47,418 --> 01:04:50,109
Make it work somehow. It's not impossible.

819
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,732
You could have a future, a child.

820
01:04:52,826 --> 01:04:54,331
You iust need to hang in there
and make it work.

821
01:04:54,716 --> 01:04:56,188
You're giving me advice?

822
01:04:58,651 --> 01:04:59,676
Yeah.

823
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:05,118
What are you gonna do?

824
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,646
l don't know. Keep swimming, l guess.

825
01:05:30,814 --> 01:05:32,095
lt's a rainout!

826
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:34,464
Let's go get some breakfast.

827
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:37,634
Take in a movie or something.
Maybe it'll clear up later.

828
01:05:38,911 --> 01:05:40,320
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Look at the current.

829
01:05:40,415 --> 01:05:41,665
We can make excellent time.

830
01:05:41,952 --> 01:05:43,809
-Are you kidding?
-What? The rain?

831
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,665
Who cares?

832
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,740
The people who normally stay dry
on this swimming trip, genius.

833
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:51,843
lt may not matter to you in the water,
but l'll take a dildo in my ass-pussy

834
01:05:51,936 --> 01:05:54,627
before l sit on a boat going
two miles an hour while it's raining.

835
01:05:54,721 --> 01:05:55,906
Let's go.

836
01:05:56,257 --> 01:05:57,217
No.

837
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:00,931
We're gonna wait till it clears up.

838
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:03,202
lf you guys don't want to, that's fine.

839
01:06:06,338 --> 01:06:09,957
But l want to reach New York by August 28th,
so l'm swimming.

840
01:06:10,529 --> 01:06:12,740
You can meet me downriver later.

841
01:06:41,189 --> 01:06:44,937
You know, it actually feels kind of warmer.

842
01:07:01,414 --> 01:07:05,226
What are you doing? Stop it! Stop it!

843
01:07:46,155 --> 01:07:47,083
Hey.

844
01:07:48,491 --> 01:07:50,669
The library in this town sucks.

845
01:07:51,181 --> 01:07:53,935
They have, like, two books and a newspaper.

846
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:56,621
What are you doing?

847
01:07:57,676 --> 01:08:01,072
ls it true, if you cut a worm in half,
you get two worms?

848
01:08:02,702 --> 01:08:04,463
l think you get three.

849
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,254
How's he doing?

850
01:08:11,885 --> 01:08:15,377
Hey, sorry about that, uh, you know, that
whole attempted murder thing this morning,

851
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:17,359
but l'm over it.

852
01:08:38,416 --> 01:08:41,971
It's amazing here.
It's really... It's amazing here!

853
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:45,714
l was on Staten Island once
near this big dump,

854
01:08:45,809 --> 01:08:50,454
where l saw these huge rats fighting
with these seagulls over the rancid garbage.

855
01:08:51,121 --> 01:08:54,709
Let me tell you, this definitely beats that.

856
01:09:00,882 --> 01:09:03,445
Have you ever seen such a lovely sight?

857
01:09:04,434 --> 01:09:06,068
Not in a long time.

858
01:09:06,964 --> 01:09:11,160
There's... There's so much more beauty
in the world, too, you know? There's...

859
01:09:12,947 --> 01:09:16,759
There's visual, artistic, emotional.

860
01:09:20,244 --> 01:09:21,430
And love.

861
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:42,231
l can't believe we don't have
any weenies to roast.

862
01:09:42,326 --> 01:09:43,480
Or marshmallows.

863
01:09:43,574 --> 01:09:45,559
We could throw Paul in the fire.

864
01:09:45,654 --> 01:09:47,960
Watch him iump out so fast
it'll make our heads spin.

865
01:09:50,775 --> 01:09:54,203
So, how are you planning on killing yourself?
You don't live in that tall building anymore.

866
01:09:55,703 --> 01:09:57,850
l'm not sure, really. Maybe a gun.

867
01:09:59,256 --> 01:10:02,298
We're not gun people.
You're not gonna shoot yourself.

868
01:10:11,801 --> 01:10:12,858
You don't understand.

869
01:10:13,657 --> 01:10:15,001
Help me understand.

870
01:10:16,090 --> 01:10:18,012
lt's not your fault, Liz,

871
01:10:18,106 --> 01:10:21,181
and it's not your responsibility
to try and save me, please.

872
01:10:23,418 --> 01:10:25,372
Look after your own lives, guys, not mine.

873
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:27,260
Well, here's the problem, butt-plug.

874
01:10:27,354 --> 01:10:30,045
You're a part of my life,
an important part of it,

875
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:31,932
and you've become a part of Liz's life, too,

876
01:10:32,026 --> 01:10:36,415
so, uh, we are worrying about our own lives.
Got it?

877
01:10:36,507 --> 01:10:39,069
Look, l'm not asking you to agree with me
on this or anything.

878
01:10:39,164 --> 01:10:42,718
l'm just asking you to respect my wishes.

879
01:10:43,867 --> 01:10:44,989
We all have to die sometime,

880
01:10:45,084 --> 01:10:48,319
so what's wrong with choosing
how and when we die ourselves?

881
01:10:48,412 --> 01:10:52,641
lf l were a quadriplegic with burns
over 90% of my body,

882
01:10:52,733 --> 01:10:55,199
you wouldn't try and make me
stay alive, would you?

883
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:59,105
But you're not even close to being like that.
You're fine.

884
01:10:59,198 --> 01:11:00,864
l'm not fine at all!

885
01:11:04,669 --> 01:11:07,232
Nobody's saying emotional suffering
isn't valid, Paul.

886
01:11:07,326 --> 01:11:12,643
It... 'Cause it is,
and clearly you're not fine,

887
01:11:12,736 --> 01:11:15,746
but the difference between
a quadriplegic and you

888
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:18,432
is that you can heal someday.

889
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:21,537
That's your opinion.

890
01:11:21,632 --> 01:11:24,098
No, Paul, that's a fact,
whether you think it is or not.

891
01:11:24,192 --> 01:11:29,701
People can and do heal from emotional pain,
and l'm sick of you saying it's hopeless.

892
01:11:29,888 --> 01:11:31,457
You want us to let you die?

893
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:33,986
You want us to drive this boat
down the river for you?

894
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:35,745
Then make us a promise,

895
01:11:35,842 --> 01:11:40,070
and that is to at least consider the possibility
that you still haven't given this enough time,

896
01:11:40,161 --> 01:11:41,539
that you could be wrong about everything.

897
01:12:14,341 --> 01:12:15,845
What was he like as a kid?

898
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,021
He was shorter.

899
01:12:20,101 --> 01:12:21,798
He was unusual, actually.

900
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:26,859
Um... One part of him was
confident, fun, adventurous.

901
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:30,249
Then there was always this other side,
for as long as l can remember.

902
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:32,424
This vulnerability, this, uh,

903
01:12:35,525 --> 01:12:37,191
fragile part of him.

904
01:12:42,822 --> 01:12:44,585
Good old Indian Point.

905
01:12:44,871 --> 01:12:48,234
Hey, wanna get a move-along there?
Uh, we wanna get past these things.

906
01:12:48,327 --> 01:12:49,993
l'm no Mark Spitzer.

907
01:12:50,791 --> 01:12:52,968
Or Stevie Brennan for that matter.

908
01:12:53,063 --> 01:12:55,305
ls it true the water is warmer
near these plants

909
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,707
'cause of the crap they discharge
into the river?

910
01:12:57,801 --> 01:12:59,722
No. It's freezing!

911
01:13:01,737 --> 01:13:03,563
Should be in Hastings soon.

912
01:13:03,657 --> 01:13:07,854
We can crash at my parents',
'cause they're in Nantucket for the summer.

913
01:13:08,873 --> 01:13:10,698
At their other house that they can afford,

914
01:13:10,794 --> 01:13:13,741
'cause they worked hard
and made the right choices in life,

915
01:13:13,834 --> 01:13:18,478
while l didn't, and therefore live
in a small, no-AC apartment.

916
01:13:19,402 --> 01:13:22,542
But whatever.

917
01:13:46,765 --> 01:13:49,199
''One should always carry
a set of keys to their parents' house.''

918
01:13:49,295 --> 01:13:50,735
lt's just my life philosophy.

919
01:13:50,829 --> 01:13:52,654
Think your mother
still keeps Nestlé's Quik around?

920
01:13:52,749 --> 01:13:54,031
l know she does.

921
01:13:54,126 --> 01:13:56,240
-Nilla wafers, too.
-Jackpot!

922
01:13:56,334 --> 01:13:58,255
- Nice house.
-Yes.

923
01:13:58,541 --> 01:14:00,462
Welcome to my former home.

924
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:02,864
Wish l had appreciated it more at the time.

925
01:15:03,221 --> 01:15:05,496
Don't leave us.

926
01:15:06,260 --> 01:15:08,310
Don't leave us, Paul.

927
01:15:09,910 --> 01:15:11,350
Don't leave me.

928
01:15:12,276 --> 01:15:14,678
You're so lovely.

929
01:15:28,118 --> 01:15:30,873
That ought to clear things out for a while.

930
01:15:33,463 --> 01:15:35,256
lt's nice up here, huh?

931
01:15:37,655 --> 01:15:40,667
Remember how we used to build
forts in the woods?

932
01:15:41,175 --> 01:15:43,353
We spent weeks on those things.

933
01:15:43,448 --> 01:15:46,298
l loved building those forts.

934
01:15:46,584 --> 01:15:48,377
They were so elaborate.

935
01:15:53,272 --> 01:15:54,778
You know, you could stay here
for a while, if you want.

936
01:15:54,873 --> 01:15:57,692
My parents won't be back till October.
You could just hang around up here.

937
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:02,847
Take walks in the woods,
eat Nilla wafers, just hang out and relax.

938
01:16:18,556 --> 01:16:21,053
We should get back to the river.

939
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:05,985
If l find you messing
with my dad's gay porn stash,

940
01:17:06,080 --> 01:17:08,162
there's gonna be hell to pay.

941
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:09,473
Liz.

942
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:13,153
You okay?

943
01:17:16,065 --> 01:17:17,827
He wants to get going.

944
01:17:20,482 --> 01:17:21,922
Mmm. l know.

945
01:18:04,101 --> 01:18:06,760
Amy. Olivia.

946
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:53,900
l'm sorry, l'm sorry.

947
01:19:27,149 --> 01:19:28,494
Time

948
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:36,402
All the long, red lines

949
01:19:38,863 --> 01:19:41,713
That take control

950
01:19:44,686 --> 01:19:49,779
Of all the smokelike streams

951
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:54,195
That flow into your dreams

952
01:19:57,423 --> 01:20:01,715
The big, blue, open sea

953
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:07,731
That can't be crossed

954
01:20:11,217 --> 01:20:14,932
That can't be climbed

955
01:20:17,649 --> 01:20:19,699
Just torn between

956
01:20:23,793 --> 01:20:28,759
Oh, the two white lines

957
01:20:29,427 --> 01:20:33,078
Distant gods and faded signs

958
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:41,656
Of all those blinking lights

959
01:20:42,101 --> 01:20:45,751
You had to pick the one tonight

960
01:21:36,633 --> 01:21:38,490
Holes

961
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:45,918
Dug by little moles

962
01:21:48,058 --> 01:21:50,877
Angry, jealous spies

963
01:21:54,107 --> 01:21:58,655
Got telephones for eyes

964
01:22:00,892 --> 01:22:03,806
Come to you as friends

965
01:22:07,260 --> 01:22:11,745
All those endless ends

966
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,542
That can't be tied

967
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:24,417
Oh, they make me laugh

968
01:22:26,589 --> 01:22:29,120
And always make me cry

969
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:38,083
Till they drop like flies

970
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:42,530
And sink like polished stones

971
01:22:46,015 --> 01:22:50,820
Of all the stones l throw

972
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:55,715
How does that old song go?

973
01:23:05,601 --> 01:23:08,356
How does that old song go?

974
01:23:13,314 --> 01:23:15,012
Congratulations, man.

975
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:18,692
-Good work.
-Thank you.

976
01:23:20,354 --> 01:23:21,604
Thank you.

977
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:24,741
Some rough waters at the end there.

978
01:23:27,683 --> 01:23:28,708
Yeah.

979
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:32,421
Well, you made it through.

980
01:23:35,172 --> 01:23:38,310
Let's get back in the boat,
motor over to Chinatown,

981
01:23:38,404 --> 01:23:40,967
get some celebration dinner. All right?

982
01:23:42,341 --> 01:23:44,134
Come on, man. My treat.

983
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,919
l'm not getting back in the boat.

984
01:23:47,013 --> 01:23:48,038
What?

985
01:23:49,478 --> 01:23:51,751
l'm not getting back in the boat.

986
01:23:52,614 --> 01:23:54,376
What are you gonna do?

987
01:24:09,095 --> 01:24:10,537
Aw, Jesus, man.

988
01:24:11,144 --> 01:24:13,033
Thank you for everything.

989
01:24:14,344 --> 01:24:15,464
Really.

990
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:23,880
Paul.

991
01:24:23,976 --> 01:24:25,608
Don't get back in that water.

992
01:24:30,281 --> 01:24:31,850
Do not get back in that water!

993
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:37,321
Paul, please.

994
01:24:37,834 --> 01:24:41,229
Just get back into the boat. We'll iust...
We'll go home.

995
01:24:43,659 --> 01:24:44,908
l'm sorry.

996
01:25:06,604 --> 01:25:08,942
Where are you going?
Where the hell are you going?

997
01:25:13,453 --> 01:25:14,478
Paul.

998
01:25:15,341 --> 01:25:17,776
lt's okay, Jeff. It really is.

999
01:25:18,382 --> 01:25:22,162
You've done all you can.
You've been a good friend, a great one.

1000
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:24,879
Please, keep the deal we made.

1001
01:26:22,739 --> 01:26:24,438
l'm gonna go get him.

1002
01:26:30,900 --> 01:26:33,302
lf he wants to turn around, he will.
