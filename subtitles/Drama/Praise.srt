1
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,441
Do you remember the names?

2
00:00:42,175 --> 00:00:43,984
Maybe nothing was said.

3
00:00:49,816 --> 00:00:51,591
The end of a demonstration.

4
00:00:53,353 --> 00:00:56,994
She's with a male friend.

5
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:58,932
To make him happy

6
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,370
- she wears a yellow star.
- A trinity of stories

7
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,769
The beginning

8
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,877
The end

9
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,204
Then she writes something...

10
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,482
SOMETHING

11
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:15,749
"You jobless,

12
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,151
use this time to start thinking"?

13
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,317
Then these guys arrive,

14
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:25,055
see the yellow star,
try to tear it off,

15
00:01:25,185 --> 00:01:26,721
telling her:

16
00:01:26,853 --> 00:01:30,130
"Wanna see some fascists?
Well, here they are."

17
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:33,169
Then they beat her unconscious.

18
00:01:35,528 --> 00:01:36,666
Time passes.

19
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:39,542
Don't move.

20
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,479
What times!

21
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,144
Humans remain.

22
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,380
And if you were to be asked:

23
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,252
film, play, novel or opera?

24
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:56,318
Which would you choose?

25
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,429
Novel, I guess.

26
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,122
We have a project.

27
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:30,694
It relates something of the story

28
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,160
of three couples:

29
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,698
young, adult,

30
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,130
and old.

31
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:40,597
And this something

32
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,142
is one of the four moments of love.

33
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:56,916
The meeting,

34
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:59,045
the physical passion,

35
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:02,558
the separation...

36
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,593
then the reconciliation.

37
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:07,592
So what will you play?

38
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:19,666
I think I'll play the young girl.

39
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:21,608
I'm thinking of something.

40
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,573
His name is Perceval.

41
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:28,811
And her name will be Eglantine.

42
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,325
I'm Eglantine.

43
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:48,833
Do you understand it's not
Eglantine's story,

44
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,499
but a moment in history...

45
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:54,840
History moving through Eglantine?

46
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:57,107
The moment of youth.

47
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,989
Let's call it a sociological study.

48
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,057
For example,
when the old man and woman meet,

49
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,629
it'll be in a soup kitchen.

50
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:17,531
In this project, in fact,

51
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,160
we can't help but depict...

52
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,904
depict the down-and-out.

53
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,338
They're everywhere nowadays.

54
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:28,503
The ones Victor Hugo...

55
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,810
You know Victor Hugo?

56
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:38,851
Take a seat.

57
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,993
You can smoke if you want.

58
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,892
What are you thinking about?

59
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:58,940
I was wondering if my cigarette
would hold out 'til tonight.

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,578
And if my laces would hold out
'til tomorrow.

61
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:09,384
And if my breath

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,381
would hold out 'til next week.

63
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:17,258
Do you work?

64
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:18,953
Yes, a lot.

65
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:20,930
At night, too?

66
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,590
Especially at night.

67
00:05:23,956 --> 00:05:25,799
And in the night of day.

68
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,035
Do you ever cry?

69
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,208
At first glance, you can see
why children cry.

70
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,783
While people are walking by.

71
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:46,418
That's how Albert
and Albertine loved each other.

72
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,062
I don't know.

73
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:58,991
It all depends
on how I still see myself.

74
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:07,505
Someone who plans
to keep moving ahead

75
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:13,145
implies that his previous self

76
00:06:15,808 --> 00:06:17,754
is a self that no longer exists,

77
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,620
and he loses interest in it.

78
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,958
On the other hand,
the plans of others

79
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,360
reject time...

80
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,041
and thereby create a strong bond
with the past.

81
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:47,140
It's true of almost all old people.

82
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:54,023
They can't abide time

83
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,888
for fear of wasting away.

84
00:07:01,954 --> 00:07:02,932
Everyone,

85
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,904
in his heart of hearts...

86
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:26,982
There are the poor.

87
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,491
I don't know how memory

88
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,323
can help us

89
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,598
reclaim our lives.

90
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:42,164
It's not whether man will endure,

91
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:45,005
but whether he has the right to.

92
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,784
Here comes the little fellow.

93
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:08,888
In ancient times
they emphasized relationships.

94
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,069
That's the fundamental question.

95
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:15,128
Who's this one by?

96
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,062
When will we have an answer?

97
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,002
We still need a green light
from the national bank.

98
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:51,237
You seem very fond
of that young man.

99
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,900
Too fond, in my opinion.

100
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:59,406
That's your opinion, dear fellow.

101
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:07,286
A thief is a thief, museum or not.

102
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,818
They apologized.

103
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,356
- Then neither did I.
- You're different.

104
00:09:15,588 --> 00:09:18,797
What if they only return
the Braque and Vlamincks.

105
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:20,336
We know how they are.

106
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,134
The Louvre curator wants
to protect the Winged Victory,

107
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:28,505
but as author of this protection
on equal terms with Phidias.

108
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,647
Times have changed.

109
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,611
There's a feeling of yesteryear.
It's discouraging.

110
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:40,788
Too many changes are in the air

111
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,689
that still lack a means of expression.

112
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:48,058
We make fun of 1900 but our age

113
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:52,192
will probably seem just as ridiculous.

114
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:55,001
And maybe just as charming.

115
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:58,508
I don't know.
Memory is a complex thing.

116
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,579
When they were arrested
in the '42 roundup,

117
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:08,048
Edgar's grandfather was
the same age as Dad.

118
00:10:08,574 --> 00:10:11,350
They were partners in the gallery.

119
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:15,256
I was 10. I'd play in the park
with his daughter.

120
00:10:20,553 --> 00:10:22,499
I was madly in love.

121
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,333
She preferred someone else.

122
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,701
So I said to her,

123
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,841
quoting Jouvet:

124
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,006
"Happy with that hapless man?"

125
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,205
What became of him?

126
00:10:38,337 --> 00:10:39,782
With her 50%,

127
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:43,180
Héléne bought him
a Gordini, then a Talbot.

128
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:48,448
He killed himself at Indianapolis.
The same year as Ascari.

129
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:51,193
Then your debt is paid.

130
00:10:53,853 --> 00:10:55,855
But there's still memory.

131
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:08,644
Yes, the obligations of memory.

132
00:11:08,768 --> 00:11:10,941
No, the right.

133
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,809
Memory has no obligations.
Read Bergson.

134
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,713
Or else I must

135
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:21,750
still be in love.

136
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:28,423
She looked like that girl
in the Boubat photo,

137
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,025
staring into the distance,

138
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,105
wearing a black bra
under her white blouse.

139
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,834
- You've kept in touch with her?
- No, she committed suicide.

140
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,570
Luckily she had no signature power.

141
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,441
I found 2 Corots at Vollard's,

142
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,916
a Lichtenstein at Castelli's in NY,
but too late.

143
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,856
I managed to buy back
the little Breughel,

144
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,291
but I think it's a copy.

145
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:02,464
All that remains of this business

146
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:07,827
is that the boy make something
more than money.

147
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,272
I got to know him

148
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:15,208
by chance at the Soulages' home.

149
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:20,010
Antoinette Sach's daughter
introduced us.

150
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,211
I think she's Edgar's godmother.

151
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,857
Maybe he's aware of the situation,
but he said nothing.

152
00:12:31,217 --> 00:12:34,221
It's still a lot.
Even if it's a fine project.

153
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,959
I have no idea what it's about.

154
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:39,191
An opera, maybe. A film.

155
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,967
A film in the documentary tradition.

156
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:45,368
But I don't understand the term.

157
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,040
And what's it called?

158
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:54,242
Something "to Love."

159
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,543
"Ode," I think.

160
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:01,989
Isn't it strange

161
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:06,756
how works of an demand titles,

162
00:13:06,886 --> 00:13:09,492
- Like in the days of nobility.
- And Wall St.

163
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,836
Speaking of films,
did you know Henri Langlois?

164
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,371
Not really.

165
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,041
Meerson's wife, yes.

166
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:25,176
But not him. Maybe once,
at a lunch at the Raphael,

167
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,215
in '58 or '59.

168
00:13:30,576 --> 00:13:33,716
It seems he founded
the Archive Federation here

169
00:13:35,447 --> 00:13:38,792
with a German and a New Yorker.
I forgot her name.

170
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:42,229
In 1938. Iris Barry.

171
00:13:48,594 --> 00:13:50,369
See Counselor Forlani out.

172
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:02,318
The Americans are everywhere,
aren't they, sir?

173
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:09,216
Who remembers
Vietnam's resistance?

174
00:14:14,386 --> 00:14:15,922
Explain it better.

175
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,062
It's like this...

176
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:24,607
With young people it's obvious.

177
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:27,469
You pass them in the street

178
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:31,239
and the first thing you say is:
they're youngsters.

179
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:34,445
With old people,

180
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,819
same thing.

181
00:14:36,942 --> 00:14:38,853
Before anything else,

182
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,616
you think:

183
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,915
that's an old man.

184
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,324
But with adults,
it's anything but obvious.

185
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:49,831
They're never entirely naked,
so to speak.

186
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:53,960
They have to have a story,
even in porno movies.

187
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:55,504
I understand.

188
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:58,939
We have to examine this business
more closely,

189
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,544
but I see the point you're making.

190
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:13,045
We need the three ages, you see.

191
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,283
Or else the project's dead.

192
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:20,554
It becomes a story with Julia Roberts...

193
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,694
Hollywood.

194
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:28,399
Not History.

195
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,132
Yes, I understand. It's hard.

196
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,302
But you'll find something.

197
00:15:45,878 --> 00:15:48,882
And that young lady
Philippe told me about.

198
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,925
Still haven't seen her?

199
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,221
I've seen so many.

200
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,167
On top of it, she acted in a TV series.

201
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:00,560
That depresses me.

202
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,705
I hear she refused to speak her lines.

203
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:05,536
Wasn't she fired?

204
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,672
That counts for something these days.

205
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,077
True.

206
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:14,941
I'll make an effort.

207
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,678
Don't have a photo on you?

208
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,584
She wouldn't give us one.

209
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,704
I don't seek, I find.

210
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,617
Most people have the guts
to live their life,

211
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,421
but not to imagine it.

212
00:17:31,817 --> 00:17:34,525
So how I can do it for them?

213
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:46,669
Two years ago I met someone.

214
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,006
I didn't tell you, did I?

215
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,673
Not very attractive,

216
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,149
but she dared speak her mind.

217
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,547
I wonder what became of her.

218
00:17:57,776 --> 00:18:01,189
What's your definition of an adult?

219
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:07,828
She really had something to say
about the State.

220
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,731
And the impossibility of the State
falling in love.

221
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:14,461
Actually, I'm dreaming.

222
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,700
What'd I like is someone

223
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:21,409
like Simone Weil and Hannah Arendt.

224
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:24,546
A shame you gave up your cantata.

225
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:28,081
- Was the music the problem?
- It was me.

226
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,848
Know what she earns as a waitress?

227
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:33,420
3000 or 4000 francs.

228
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,883
She also works elsewhere.

229
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:43,327
When they earn more
than 10,000 francs a month,

230
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,030
the French let themselves
be led by the nose.

231
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:53,399
- Don't you agree, Philippe?
- I don't know, sir.

232
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:30,238
The strangest thing is

233
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,542
the living dead of this world

234
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,049
are modeled on the world as it was.

235
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,777
The way they think and feel
comes from before.

236
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,015
So, did you find the line?

237
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:15,857
"Jeanne, what a strange path
led me to you." But I'm not sure.

238
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,436
I'll check the bookshop.

239
00:21:11,036 --> 00:21:15,075
I was right. She's working
at a railroad depot tonight.

240
00:21:19,811 --> 00:21:21,518
Things are right in front of us.

241
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:25,155
Why make them up?

242
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,477
We're looking for a girl
with big eyes who works here.

243
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:25,341
Go see the girls outside.

244
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,377
You again? I said no.

245
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,311
- You're killing yourself.
- It's my business.

246
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,586
Maybe not.

247
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,528
How are you, otherwise?

248
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,265
I have work to do. Leave me alone.

249
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:27,843
And how are you?

250
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,769
I'm fine.

251
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,776
How'd it go with the Americans?

252
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,062
Which Americans?

253
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:53,795
The Americans of North America.

254
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,703
You have some memory.

255
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,202
I think I do.

256
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,706
Too much of it, even.

257
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,582
I wouldn't know.

258
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:13,147
It's no longer my business.

259
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,890
Can we talk a minute?

260
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:20,557
Please.

261
00:25:27,726 --> 00:25:29,933
Can't you see I'm working?

262
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,235
So am I.

263
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:34,474
I can wait.

264
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:38,004
I noticed an Arab restaurant.

265
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,210
It was still open.

266
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,079
I'll wait for you there.

267
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:44,177
No, I said.

268
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,913
I have to clean offices after this.

269
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,796
We can give you a lift.

270
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,632
I don't want you to.

271
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,428
Next week, then.

272
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,970
You must have a day off.

273
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:10,206
I have to drive my son to Dijon.

274
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,674
So long. It's all right.

275
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:16,047
I want to discuss a project.

276
00:26:16,274 --> 00:26:17,947
Maybe better than that.

277
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:25,060
Sure, but I already said no.

278
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,308
You prefer never?

279
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:57,756
- What did she say?
- Maybe.

280
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,908
When young people break up,
things become incomprehensible.

281
00:27:13,331 --> 00:27:14,833
Take them.

282
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:16,610
They're at the pool.

283
00:27:16,835 --> 00:27:19,406
She watches him swim
with a girlfriend.

284
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,912
She shivers.

285
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:23,448
Why doesn't he love her now?

286
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:25,780
"You didn't get my letter?" he asks.

287
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:27,615
"I don't understand it."

288
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,892
"But it's simple enough.

289
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,757
I love you so much, you're so present,

290
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:35,455
you're so real for me

291
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:39,125
it's useless to see you
as you'll always be there,

292
00:27:39,257 --> 00:27:40,702
whatever happens."

293
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,897
She tugs anxiously on her necklace.

294
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,531
It breaks.

295
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,541
The beads fall into the pool.

296
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,210
He dives in and brings one back.

297
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:58,246
He says something else.

298
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,989
She cries.

299
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:14,827
"Why run after something
you have already?

300
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:22,110
In a word, you're too lovely
to be desired,

301
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:26,146
and I placed you too high
for you to satisfy me.

302
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,140
I love you, you're mine.

303
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:33,448
But since you're mine
I don't have to see you."

304
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:35,756
You see what's going on?

305
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:37,451
And you?

306
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,989
Could you say that
to the person you love?

307
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,360
Would you accept it
from someone you love?

308
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,337
That's why Eglantine
and Perceval broke up.

309
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:03,179
We'll wait 5 more minutes.

310
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,146
You have time?

311
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:11,887
Someone said that two years ago.

312
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,063
I remembered it, but not clearly.

313
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:21,234
Once, at a book stall
I found the text.

314
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,671
It's a short novel by Georges Bataille.

315
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,579
You heard of him?

316
00:29:33,571 --> 00:29:37,212
On the Spanish Civil War
people always cite "Man's Hope,"

317
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,422
never "Blue of Noon."

318
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:42,982
True, it came out after the Liberation.

319
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,058
I think it sold 300 copies.

320
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:54,169
- Philippe, do it with him?
- Yes, sir.

321
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,610
"Love of a mortal being."

322
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,807
"You say love,

323
00:30:05,937 --> 00:30:08,577
but the antithesis of the loved one

324
00:30:08,706 --> 00:30:10,276
is the State,

325
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,117
whose role negates
the sovereign value of love.

326
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:18,421
The State has not, or has lost,
the power to embrace

327
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,552
the world in its totality.

328
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:24,030
This totality of the universe
offered both

329
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,431
in the beloved, as an object,

330
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:29,437
and in the lover,
as the subject."

331
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,038
This is no good.

332
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,209
Why not?

333
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,479
I told you why.

334
00:30:39,704 --> 00:30:41,809
There's no such thing as an adult.

335
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,550
Do you ever think about death?

336
00:30:52,984 --> 00:30:55,464
I mean, your own death?

337
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:04,069
Then you haven't made a will?

338
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:12,514
A man was executed at the Liberation
50 years ago.

339
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:15,907
He wrote this the night before.

340
00:31:16,641 --> 00:31:18,018
Read it to us.

341
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,750
"In Year 35 of my years,
Like Villon, a prisoner."

342
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:25,684
- "Like Cervantes..."
- That won't do.

343
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:30,125
Learn how to read, ma'am. Or recite.

344
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,493
Or learn how to listen.

345
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:35,269
Isn't that so, Philippe?

346
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,369
I didn't say, look.

347
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,547
I said, listen.

348
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,879
Hear.

349
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,630
"In the awkward scrawl of these pages

350
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,729
I begin my last will and testament.

351
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,510
By court order, my worldly goods

352
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:19,343
And heritage they'll take from me.

353
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,479
That's easy, I had neither

354
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,748
Land or money in my patrimony.

355
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,919
As for my books and images

356
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,022
Let them be dispersed to the wind.

357
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,730
Neither tenderness nor courage

358
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,667
Are things a court can rescind."

359
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,776
The minister gave his green light.

360
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:50,712
Thank you, counselor.

361
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,709
Strolling or working?

362
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:57,078
We're going to a talk on Kosovo.

363
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,219
Mark Hunter just came back from there.

364
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,685
You've been following this business?

365
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,528
A little.

366
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,071
And the young lady, Edgar?

367
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,043
We went to see her. Not great.

368
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:30,451
She's no Berthe Morisot.

369
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,615
You knew I'd met her before?

370
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,648
Two years back, on the coast.

371
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:06,354
"I knew how history would be told.

372
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:09,424
The Serbs committed horrors

373
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,529
in their frightful persecution

374
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:15,822
of the Albanians of Kosovo.

375
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,173
No journalist noted
that most of the refugees

376
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:28,639
were in their homes
when the war broke out

377
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,677
and that the Serbs warned
they'd settle the Albanians' score

378
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,282
if NATO attacked Yugoslavia."

379
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,634
"I recognize their fear.

380
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:05,143
The radio said that the Serbs
had the right to kill at will.

381
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,911
Even women, children and old people.

382
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:15,214
But I cannot hide my shame at learning

383
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,858
that for the first time in our history

384
00:35:18,082 --> 00:35:20,494
we, the Albanians of Kosovo,

385
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,924
are equally capable of acts
just as monstruous."

386
00:35:25,156 --> 00:35:26,829
Your nationality?

387
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,594
I have none.

388
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:35,574
Kurd, but stateless.

389
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:43,108
I'm from Madrid.

390
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,936
There are good Americans, too.

391
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:05,930
Mark left his country
during the Reagan era.

392
00:36:06,464 --> 00:36:10,310
There can be no resistance
without memory or universalism.

393
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,409
"No peace without justice,"
it was said at Sarajevo.

394
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:17,813
What do we do?

395
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:20,882
We're stupid.

396
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,717
The American accent's awful.

397
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:28,330
You wanted America, you got it.

398
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,590
Not me, I didn't ask for anything.

399
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,326
And your parents, in 1944?

400
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,605
And your grandparents, in 1918?

401
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,667
What are you talking about?

402
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,639
Nothing. It's history.

403
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,677
He's looking for someone

404
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:50,183
to edit his book
and correct the proofs.

405
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:08,394
There can be no resistance
without memory

406
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,506
or universalism.

407
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:55,740
Isn't it strange how history
has been replaced by technology?

408
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,419
But why politics by gospel?

409
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,155
The church is in step with time.

410
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:11,225
Drop Mr. Forlani
at the Intercontinental.

411
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,505
If you don't object, Paul,

412
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,541
pan of your fees
will be paid in kind.

413
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:22,008
What do you mean?

414
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,340
Weren't you looking
for a Balzac edition?

415
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,609
Absolutely.

416
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:30,946
"A Harlot High and Low."

417
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,214
The 1844 edition.

418
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:34,914
Where did you find it?

419
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,649
Better than the original.

420
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:42,229
The living copy. Living.

421
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:44,691
"She had hair

422
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:48,392
"that no coiffeur's hand could hold,
so thick was it,

423
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:53,075
"and so long that it fell
to the floor in rings."

424
00:39:02,606 --> 00:39:04,449
Living Esther, Paul.

425
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:14,753
- A Jewess?
- As only Raphael could draw them!

426
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,805
The church is in step with time.

427
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,973
Like troops moving
through unfamiliar territory

428
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,813
where normal provisioning
is impossible.

429
00:39:39,744 --> 00:39:41,849
How can it bequeath to the meek,

430
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,786
the legitimate heirs of God,

431
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:46,153
a kingdom not of this world?

432
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,760
You never think of it,

433
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:59,300
but the truth may turn out to be sad.

434
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,016
What are you after?

435
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,783
With me?

436
00:40:15,446 --> 00:40:16,948
I have papers to sign.

437
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,821
"Here peace officer Revel
was shot by the Germans..."

438
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:22,291
I don't understand the lawyers.

439
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:28,537
I need people for this project.

440
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,035
I don't like that world.

441
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,534
Same here.

442
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,471
I'm full of doubts.

443
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:46,221
- Shall we walk?
- l walk home anyway.

444
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,082
You'll tire before me.

445
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,496
They shouldn't phrase it like that.

446
00:41:01,325 --> 00:41:03,999
Neither "officer" nor "peace"

447
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:06,073
nor "Germans."

448
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,046
People often say something
in a discussion.

449
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:19,345
They don't agree, so they say,

450
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,682
"And you? What are you doing here?"

451
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:26,060
The other answers,
"That's another story."

452
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,297
But they never tell that other story.

453
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,865
They never start from there.

454
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,473
Maybe because it has to be told
another way

455
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,579
and they haven't the guts.

456
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,244
That's what happened to my parents.

457
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,380
They committed suicide.

458
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,752
I don't know about Mother,

459
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,318
but my father left a letter.

460
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:01,289
He never said "globalization."
He said "the universal stage."

461
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,231
I was 5 years old.

462
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,270
I was born 3 years before May '68.

463
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:14,232
What are you thinking about?

464
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:20,342
The empty fortress.

465
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,456
That sounds familiar.

466
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,324
I was thinking
of the Communist trade union.

467
00:42:38,422 --> 00:42:40,095
There is no emptiness.

468
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,963
There's always a voice somewhere.

469
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,774
What about silence?

470
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:51,140
Even in silence.

471
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,483
- What about death?
- There is no death.

472
00:42:58,075 --> 00:43:01,545
When it comes, there's always
a sense of self.

473
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,074
When I said "empty fortress,"

474
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:29,477
I was actually thinking
of workers' struggles.

475
00:43:30,474 --> 00:43:32,215
And the ephemeral.

476
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,091
We haven't really discussed
your project.

477
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,490
It keeps jumping the track.

478
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:48,603
But which track?

479
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:53,206
The one from childhood to old age.

480
00:43:55,332 --> 00:43:57,369
You referring to adulthood?

481
00:43:58,602 --> 00:43:59,876
If you want.

482
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:03,684
Am I wrong

483
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,580
or you don't have children?

484
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,288
You're right. I live alone.

485
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:15,861
And you?

486
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,932
I have a 3-year-old boy.

487
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,100
After you got married?

488
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,033
My boyfriend left me.

489
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,738
Since our breakup,

490
00:44:29,366 --> 00:44:32,245
and when I think about it,
and only then,

491
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,113
things start making sense.

492
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,624
What you're saying is interesting.

493
00:44:43,614 --> 00:44:46,458
Things beginning,
things coming to an end.

494
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:57,836
Not your story or mine,

495
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,236
but, whatever happens, our story.

496
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:04,141
Even if we aren't acquainted.

497
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:07,341
History.

498
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:13,320
When we met in Brittany
and talked a bit,

499
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:17,315
you had nothing to say
about what was going on.

500
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,625
Even if it didn't concern you.

501
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:22,755
How you really felt.

502
00:45:23,754 --> 00:45:25,358
The principle of it, I mean.

503
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,932
I think you were right.

504
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,932
- Americans have no real past.
- Those in the north.

505
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,344
Not the Mexicans. Not Brazil.

506
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,638
Yes, the Americans of the north.

507
00:45:40,871 --> 00:45:42,873
They have no memory of their own.

508
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,554
Their machines do,
but they have none personally.

509
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,688
So they buy the past of others.

510
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,823
Especially those who resisted.

511
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,686
Or they sell talking images.

512
00:45:54,184 --> 00:45:55,959
But an image never talks.

513
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,801
That's what they want.

514
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,971
I agree with you.

515
00:46:15,806 --> 00:46:17,649
When I think about something,

516
00:46:18,475 --> 00:46:22,082
I'm really thinking of something else.

517
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,591
You can only think about something

518
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:31,999
if you think of something else.

519
00:46:34,158 --> 00:46:35,364
For instance,

520
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:38,036
you see a landscape new to you.

521
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:40,600
But it's new to you

522
00:46:40,831 --> 00:46:43,573
because you mentally compare it

523
00:46:44,668 --> 00:46:46,614
to another landscape,

524
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,842
one which you know.

525
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:24,743
Is that Auteuil over there?

526
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:28,719
Way down there.

527
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,550
It was near the Mirabeau Bridge,

528
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:33,819
in 52 B.C.,

529
00:47:34,051 --> 00:47:36,622
that Caesar's general
crossed the Seine

530
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,596
into the Grenelle plain to attack

531
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:41,825
the Gallic troops of Lutetia.

532
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,232
There was forest there, all round.

533
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:50,477
What remains today

534
00:47:51,568 --> 00:47:53,138
is the Bois de Boulogne.

535
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,728
"Drancy Future"

536
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,644
Who ever connected Drancy
with the future?

537
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:08,413
Oh, some upright family man.

538
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:12,857
He came home from the office,
kissed his children

539
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:16,029
and told his little girl
he'd worked well.

540
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:22,537
You're right.

541
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,373
The truth may turn out to be sad.

542
00:49:28,832 --> 00:49:30,834
I'll lend you a book on the subject.

543
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,087
No, I won't tell you where I live.

544
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:44,957
At the bookshop.

545
00:49:47,250 --> 00:49:48,752
They hold on to my mail.

546
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:00,038
Why don't you talk
about your project anymore?

547
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,541
I'm not right for it now.

548
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,313
I'm not beautiful enough.

549
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,623
I think, though, that you think so.

550
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:22,797
My grandfather, 3 years ago...

551
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,467
You asked why he still
belonged to the Communist Party.

552
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,462
He would never say "women,"

553
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:31,800
he would say, "persons of sex."

554
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:36,299
Good, I made you laugh.

555
00:50:37,968 --> 00:50:39,311
Yes, true.

556
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:45,245
We can never know
what a thought is all about.

557
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,588
You win. I was smiling.

558
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:55,919
Say it again, slowly?

559
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,631
"Every thought

560
00:51:01,191 --> 00:51:02,864
"should recall

561
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,535
the debris

562
00:51:07,197 --> 00:51:08,471
of a smile."

563
00:51:12,335 --> 00:51:13,609
I hope so.

564
00:51:15,172 --> 00:51:16,378
Goodbye.

565
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,852
After your meeting
with Jean Lacouture,

566
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,820
I left, too.

567
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,528
I never kept in touch.

568
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:31,832
I took the same train you did.

569
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:35,525
I figured I shouldn't stop them.

570
00:51:37,027 --> 00:51:39,303
No, just things.

571
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,501
Things just.

572
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:20,247
Not very cheerful here.

573
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:22,507
Happiness is never cheerful.

574
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,746
You didn't make that up.

575
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,614
No, sir. It was Max Ophuls.

576
00:52:49,866 --> 00:52:51,607
Come on. You, mister.

577
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,813
- "I think: If He came back...
- Who?

578
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,549
You know who. The Galilean hobo.

579
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:08,426
The redhead with a heart
larger than life.

580
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,092
If the spotless lamb returned..."

581
00:53:11,321 --> 00:53:12,925
They're waiting for us.

582
00:53:13,223 --> 00:53:14,463
And Edgar?

583
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,165
He's here.

584
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,808
And they say Daumier isn't a painter.

585
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,756
So you dropped the play idea.

586
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,521
Yes, too much shouting.

587
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:45,995
Remember what you said to me?

588
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,362
Nothing is lost now but our honor.

589
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:50,265
So, the honor is yours, sir.

590
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:53,875
- What must I do?
- You just say, "Go on."

591
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,818
So Eglantine and Perceval met again.

592
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,307
What are you doing here?

593
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:09,836
A friend.

594
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:15,675
We were visiting Mr. Rosenthal.

595
00:56:23,246 --> 00:56:24,691
How's he been?

596
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:28,418
Since you left he's let himself go.
His memory's going.

597
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,627
And you, how are you?

598
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:35,027
I'm fine, now.

599
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,611
I've taken up boxing again,
and my cantata.

600
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,284
It's turning into an opera.

601
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,146
"Joy of Man's Desiring."

602
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:55,114
That's right.

603
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:57,282
I heard you got married.

604
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,156
You must be joking.

605
00:57:02,685 --> 00:57:04,995
True, in time she became pathetic.

606
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:10,728
You know how things go, I think.

607
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:15,471
Every thought should recall
a capsized smile.

608
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,201
- Where'd you hear that phrase?
- Nowhere.

609
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:20,005
I just made it up.

610
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,647
Philippe, the days of phrases are over.

611
00:57:24,908 --> 00:57:27,582
- How's she been?
- I'm about to find out.

612
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:30,320
I have an appointment next door.

613
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,218
- Good luck.
- Yes, sir.

614
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,164
Is that Edgar?

615
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:42,063
Why call him "sir"?
He's younger than you.

616
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:46,069
Maybe, but he's the only person
trying to become an adult.

617
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,993
We got a letter from Amsterdam.

618
00:58:44,287 --> 00:58:47,427
They have people there
who help others end it all.

619
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:52,103
You know about her parents,
don't you?

620
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,403
Yes, she told me.

621
00:58:57,066 --> 00:58:58,340
Recently?

622
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,641
Or when you came that time?

623
00:59:02,005 --> 00:59:03,279
Recently.

624
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:06,916
She was working here?

625
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,855
We were only told
she still had some things here.

626
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,353
And that she wanted to leave you
one of her books.

627
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,161
Take your pick.

628
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,132
How did you get my address?

629
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:24,133
She didn't have it.

630
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,967
Apparently, she did.

631
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:30,204
You shouldn't have dropped
that project.

632
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,444
She told you about it?

633
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,308
Early last fall.

634
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:40,516
We'd had no news for 3 years.
She believed in it, you know.

635
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,351
That's no reason to commit suicide.

636
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:53,693
Maybe it's none of my business,
but how'd it go with those Americans?

637
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:55,496
No, it's none of your business.

638
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:03,736
There was also her tuberculosis.

639
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,178
I didn't know.

640
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:08,416
She hid it, like her mother did.

641
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,018
What about her little boy?

642
01:00:13,209 --> 01:00:15,382
Did you know her well?

643
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,356
I don't even know her name.
Or yours.

644
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:23,254
At your hotel
we hardly talked 10 minutes.

645
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:26,333
Not much more when we met again.

646
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,835
Her tone of voice interested me.

647
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,505
It often brought ideas to life.

648
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,703
As for the rest...

649
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:38,041
she was a letdown.

650
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:42,381
- I'll take this one.
- You're the letdown.

651
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:43,879
Good luck.

652
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,885
What luck?

653
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:14,380
TWO YEARS EARLIER

654
01:01:36,893 --> 01:01:38,133
You're Edgar?

655
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,307
You've come to see Jean Lacouture.

656
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,339
He asked me to fetch you.

657
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:03,354
I'm in charge of culture for the city.

658
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,328
You're writing on Catholics
in the Resistance.

659
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,126
It's just a study.

660
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,462
I have some interesting records.

661
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:14,197
My great-uncle left many papers.

662
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,804
"Memoirs of a Free France Agent"

663
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,314
And all the "Confrérie
de Notre-Dame" archives.

664
01:02:23,773 --> 01:02:27,050
Actually, I'm composing a cantata.

665
01:02:28,010 --> 01:02:29,819
A cantata for Simone Weil.

666
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,373
I wonder if they're
who I think they are.

667
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:52,671
- Who do you mean?
- Pain-in-the-ass Americans.

668
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,258
As Péguy said

669
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,186
on June 17, 1940:

670
01:03:43,419 --> 01:03:45,524
"in war, I side with he who won't

671
01:03:45,755 --> 01:03:47,530
surrender the citadel."

672
01:03:51,527 --> 01:03:53,438
Catholics and the Resistance.

673
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:59,940
But right now I'm doing
background research.

674
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,485
I'm writing a cantata
for Simone Weil.

675
01:04:07,310 --> 01:04:10,154
You know what she said
about the Bible?

676
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:15,257
That it wasn't a theory about God
but a theory about Man.

677
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:26,307
Do you think the people in London
pondered those things?

678
01:04:26,429 --> 01:04:31,811
Christianity is definitely part
of the spirit of resistance.

679
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:40,180
There's that dimension
that was experienced

680
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:45,154
among French resistance fighters
on home soil.

681
01:04:53,022 --> 01:04:56,868
Look, half of Shakespeare
is set in France.

682
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:00,370
Can this war be said
to have been a religious war?

683
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:03,440
One of drama's great love scenes

684
01:05:03,666 --> 01:05:06,840
is in "Henry V,"
when the French princess

685
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:11,040
learns a few words of English.

686
01:05:11,173 --> 01:05:13,551
The most erotic ones.

687
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,848
I think, if the Catholics
and the monarchists

688
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,650
were generally the first
to go to London,

689
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:23,193
it's because they originally
came from there.

690
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:29,335
We were coming out of
a totally strange period...

691
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:38,675
Stay two more days.

692
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:46,050
To see the two Resistance veterans
who sold their memory to Hollywood.

693
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:07,941
What's going on?

694
01:06:08,564 --> 01:06:11,238
Berthe looked at the contract.
We've been had.

695
01:06:11,667 --> 01:06:14,671
Are you quite sure?
You can always negotiate.

696
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:16,281
She's crazy.

697
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:22,082
We had to close the restaurant.

698
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,386
What if we have to return the money?

699
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:27,053
Winter's coming.

700
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,626
What does Francoise think?

701
01:06:29,852 --> 01:06:33,026
I'll do what she wants.

702
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:35,402
Who's that guy with the bag?

703
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:39,697
A student working on de Gaulle
and the Catholics.

704
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:22,312
Tragedy is convenient.

705
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,145
It runs on its own.

706
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:30,824
Death, despair, and betrayal
are on the march,

707
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,961
and the storms, the tears,

708
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:37,926
the stillness, all stillness...

709
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:41,599
Tragedy is clean.

710
01:07:41,924 --> 01:07:43,835
It is restful.

711
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:48,606
With melodrama, with its traitors
and wicked villains,

712
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:50,209
A LONG TIME AGO

713
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:52,942
its avengers,

714
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:57,279
its glimmers of hope,
death becomes horrible,

715
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,147
like an accident.

716
01:07:59,275 --> 01:08:02,347
In tragedy, there's no problem.

717
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:05,722
First, we're among friends.

718
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,788
We're all innocent, in short.

719
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:13,526
60 years ago,
I crossed the Channel in that thing.

720
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,532
- The sad hope...
- Free France.

721
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,300
We're trapped,

722
01:08:19,061 --> 01:08:20,506
finally trapped.

723
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,731
We rebuilt it identically.

724
01:08:24,033 --> 01:08:25,376
You're right:

725
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:29,978
when the fact becomes legend,
print the legend.

726
01:08:36,545 --> 01:08:38,149
And who's the gentleman?

727
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,028
Why Washington?

728
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:06,786
What's he talking about?

729
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:10,784
They're saying that trade follows films.

730
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:15,019
What should we do?

731
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,561
We'll think it over, I'm taking notes.

732
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:21,063
You think it over.
We'll talk again.

733
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:24,133
Basically,

734
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:27,873
the Resistance had

735
01:09:28,664 --> 01:09:29,938
its youth...

736
01:09:33,936 --> 01:09:35,745
And it had its old age...

737
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:41,485
but it never went through adulthood.

738
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:50,262
Who's to decide if your past
is alive or not?

739
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,498
It depends on how you see yourself.

740
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:02,906
Someone who plans
to keep moving ahead

741
01:10:03,232 --> 01:10:06,941
defines his former self
as a self that no longer exists.

742
01:10:12,575 --> 01:10:16,113
But some people's plan
implies rejecting time.

743
01:10:18,514 --> 01:10:20,926
They have a strong bond
with the past.

744
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,632
It's true of almost all old people.

745
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:36,472
They can't abide time
for fear of wasting away.

746
01:10:37,933 --> 01:10:42,507
Each clings to the conviction
that he is unchanging.

747
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:52,689
But to what extent does memory
help us reclaim our lives?

748
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,962
I can't find the tape
that you recorded...

749
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:01,897
"The Secret War."

750
01:11:30,219 --> 01:11:33,063
ls that you, during the war?

751
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:37,901
Is that you, there?

752
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:44,774
That one is when Intelligence
asked me to work for the Gestapo.

753
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:49,348
Many people died because of that.

754
01:11:50,572 --> 01:11:52,518
I was acquitted twice.

755
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,253
I remained a Communist,
so they said I was a Russian spy.

756
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:03,593
True, I knew someone
in the Orchestre Rouge.

757
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,696
And who's that?

758
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:08,865
You just said hello to her.

759
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:12,905
It was an amateur opera production.

760
01:12:13,996 --> 01:12:17,375
Berthe was 19 years old.
A fabulous swimmer, too.

761
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,035
Then...

762
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,974
she fell ill and quit.
- And now?

763
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:26,249
She works in a Paris law firm.

764
01:12:27,142 --> 01:12:29,418
A LONG TIME AGO

765
01:12:29,645 --> 01:12:31,784
That was with my wife at the beach

766
01:12:33,282 --> 01:12:34,659
in '45.

767
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:38,158
We thought it was starting.

768
01:12:39,655 --> 01:12:41,430
In fact, it was ending.

769
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:45,664
I realize that it takes

770
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:49,774
- 50 years for it to end.
- It skips over the parents

771
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:53,837
and it lands on the grandchildren.

772
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,246
Maybe you're right:

773
01:13:01,477 --> 01:13:02,683
Adulthood

774
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,957
doesn't exist.

775
01:13:06,415 --> 01:13:09,328
We can't go on discussing for hours.

776
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,195
Let me start again:

777
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,638
"Our company, Spielberg Associates,

778
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:24,337
has acquired the right,
signed by Mrs. Bayarde..."

779
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:25,772
Bayard!

780
01:13:26,034 --> 01:13:28,310
Mrs. Bayard here present...

781
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,351
By this agreement

782
01:13:32,274 --> 01:13:34,652
that Mr. Bayard has also signed,

783
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:38,484
our company has acquired the rights
to their story

784
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:42,958
during the terrible years
of '41, '42, '43 and '44.

785
01:13:44,853 --> 01:13:48,357
The film's title will be
'Tristan and Isolde,'

786
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:52,330
the name of the network
the couple founded in 1941.

787
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:57,573
Mrs. Bayard as the young resistant,

788
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,041
will be played by Juliette Binoche,

789
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,044
who has just won an Oscar.

790
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:05,147
Miss Binoche was unable to come,

791
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:08,685
but will call Mrs. Bayard
this very evening.

792
01:14:10,412 --> 01:14:13,359
We have hired a top American writer

793
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:15,687
to do the screenplay.

794
01:14:19,922 --> 01:14:21,902
You say "American writer."

795
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:24,170
What "Americans" do you mean?

796
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,895
South America?

797
01:14:26,128 --> 01:14:28,608
The United States, of course.

798
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:29,935
Of course,

799
01:14:30,332 --> 01:14:32,835
but Brazil's states are united, too.

800
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,548
In Brazil they're called Brazilians.

801
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:40,245
No, I said the United States
of North America.

802
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:43,583
The United Mexican States
are N. America,

803
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,416
and they're Mexicans.

804
01:14:45,647 --> 01:14:47,888
In Canada they're called Canadians.

805
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:50,187
Which united states do you mean?

806
01:14:50,652 --> 01:14:53,394
I just said:
the United States of the North.

807
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:55,524
Well, then,

808
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:58,033
an inhabitant of your united states,

809
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,534
what's he called?

810
01:15:03,298 --> 01:15:04,777
See? You don't have a name.

811
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,778
This man signed for a country

812
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:10,881
whose inhabitants have no name.

813
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:15,049
No wonder they need
other peoples stories,

814
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,021
other peoples legends.

815
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:19,784
You're like us.

816
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,828
You're looking for the origin:
parents, siblings, cousins...

817
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:26,958
Nothing original about that.

818
01:15:28,190 --> 01:15:30,568
But we seek it inside ourselves.

819
01:15:30,993 --> 01:15:34,770
Poor you! With no history,
you have to seek it elsewhere,

820
01:15:35,898 --> 01:15:38,174
in Vietnam, Sarajevo...

821
01:15:40,536 --> 01:15:43,073
Okay, but you can do it gently...

822
01:15:44,339 --> 01:15:45,613
Nicely.

823
01:15:47,843 --> 01:15:49,948
Know the origin of the word "OK"?

824
01:15:51,647 --> 01:15:53,183
One of your generals,

825
01:15:53,815 --> 01:15:56,489
during the Civil War,
used it in his report:

826
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,288
- "0 killed."
- Let me finish.

827
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,796
The first check for 50,000 USD

828
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,435
was remitted as agreed on signature.

829
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,206
This check was cashed two days later.

830
01:16:09,698 --> 01:16:10,768
Nude scenes!

831
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,001
So we see no reason to rework

832
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:16,045
- the present agreement.
- They didn't notice.

833
01:16:16,338 --> 01:16:18,215
Today, in all films

834
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:22,787
girls must undress
and roll all over their lovers.

835
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,657
Was that really
yours and grandpa's story?

836
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:37,701
Mrs. Schindler was never paid.
She's in poverty in Argentina.

837
01:16:37,960 --> 01:16:39,962
Don't stay outside.

838
01:16:57,879 --> 01:17:00,723
I'm looking for a videotape
grandpa recorded.

839
01:17:02,484 --> 01:17:04,088
It shows terrible things:

840
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,196
the guilty's gaze on the innocent.

841
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:16,838
SO LONG AGO

842
01:17:26,842 --> 01:17:28,515
You say "State,"

843
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:34,351
but the State is the very antithesis
of the image of a loved one,

844
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,864
whose sovereign reason
negates that of love.

845
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:11,555
Thank you, Father,
for showing the babes

846
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:15,234
what you hid from the wise
and the intelligent.

847
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,245
Listen to this:

848
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,674
"October '45." It's still true.

849
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:36,781
"Today,

850
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,586
August 20, 1945,

851
01:18:40,882 --> 01:18:43,158
in this deserted and starving Paris,

852
01:18:44,519 --> 01:18:46,260
the war has ended,

853
01:18:47,989 --> 01:18:50,469
peace has not yet begun."

854
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:54,465
And this...

855
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:58,136
"But we're back in the Year 1000.

856
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:02,247
Each day is the eve
of the end of time,

857
01:19:02,370 --> 01:19:06,546
the eve of the day
when our honesty and courage

858
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,882
will no longer have meaning
for anyone.

859
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:12,619
Henceforth my freedom is purer."

860
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:16,551
And this...

861
01:19:18,019 --> 01:19:20,659
"But we, born in France,
what can we say?

862
01:19:22,124 --> 01:19:25,731
It's not much to say
it is our homeland. It's vague.

863
01:19:28,196 --> 01:19:30,506
It's our concrete situation,

864
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:33,511
our chance, and our fate.

865
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:40,245
'Until now, I lived in fear,'
said Tristan Bernard

866
01:19:40,742 --> 01:19:42,415
when they came to arrest him,

867
01:19:43,645 --> 01:19:45,852
'From now on, I will live in hope.'"

868
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:55,164
Tristan Bernard is the one who said

869
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:58,264
"If you can see Le Havre, it will rain.

870
01:19:58,860 --> 01:20:01,739
- If you can't see it anymore...
- "...It's raining."

871
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,078
- How's it going downstairs?
- You should've come.

872
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:47,552
ALREADY TWO YEARS EARLIER

873
01:21:17,906 --> 01:21:19,579
I want to tell you something.

874
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:31,858
You wanted to say something?

875
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:36,268
When did the gaze collapse?

876
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,339
10 years ago?

877
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,505
15 years?

878
01:21:45,367 --> 01:21:46,812
Maybe 50.

879
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:49,772
Before TV.

880
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:55,013
Who knows?

881
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:56,686
Be more precise.

882
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,959
Before TV took precedence.

883
01:22:03,285 --> 01:22:04,525
Over what?

884
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,369
Over current events?

885
01:22:13,194 --> 01:22:14,639
Over life.

886
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,234
Yes.

887
01:22:18,199 --> 01:22:22,011
I feel our gaze has become
a program under control.

888
01:22:23,305 --> 01:22:24,682
Subsidized.

889
01:22:26,608 --> 01:22:28,053
The image, sir,

890
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:31,185
alone capable of denying nothingness,

891
01:22:32,881 --> 01:22:35,418
is also the gaze of nothingness on us.

892
01:22:36,384 --> 01:22:37,886
I hope not.

893
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:38,791
What bothers me is not
success or failure.

894
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:42,595
It's the reams and reams
written about it.

895
01:23:42,984 --> 01:23:45,555
So it's the literature that bothers you.

896
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:48,567
Not necessarily,

897
01:23:49,290 --> 01:23:53,830
but why bother saying or writing
that "Titanic" is a global success?

898
01:23:55,897 --> 01:23:57,774
Talk about its contents.

899
01:23:57,899 --> 01:23:59,742
Talk about things,

900
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,905
but don't talk around things.

901
01:24:02,137 --> 01:24:03,241
Let's talk

902
01:24:04,239 --> 01:24:05,912
on the basis of things.

903
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:08,519
- Did you see it?
- No, not yet.

904
01:24:09,244 --> 01:24:11,121
I may agree to some extent.

905
01:24:11,746 --> 01:24:14,590
At Marrakesh, they discussed
the fate of the world.

906
01:24:15,517 --> 01:24:18,691
In fact, they use others
to talk of themselves.

907
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:22,765
It's deadly, you're right.

908
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:28,036
They confuse existence with life.
ls that it?

909
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,937
I'm no philosopher
but in my opinion, yes.

910
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:38,183
Look at a cell.
There's a nucleus of an atom, as well.

911
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:41,353
It's the basis of existence.
Around it is life.

912
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:45,684
They treat life like a whore

913
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,554
which they use to improve
their existence.

914
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:51,523
The extraordinary
to improve the ordinary.

915
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,061
That's right.

916
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:58,132
One can enjoy existence, not life.

917
01:24:58,393 --> 01:24:59,531
Exactly.

918
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:04,911
I didn't quite follow their discussions.

919
01:25:05,366 --> 01:25:07,346
This business about a film.

920
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:11,849
What do the grandmother
and her husband want?

921
01:25:12,207 --> 01:25:14,744
Jean wants money to save the hotel.

922
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:16,412
I don't know about her.

923
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:19,821
I think she wants to be star
like she was 60 years ago.

924
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:25,029
The Tristan network
was an ugly business.

925
01:25:25,987 --> 01:25:28,593
The English weren't very "orthodox."

926
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:33,500
He turned her in under orders.

927
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:39,037
No one knows what either of them
knew of the other.

928
01:25:39,434 --> 01:25:41,744
- I know.
- You know nothing at all.

929
01:25:42,337 --> 01:25:43,839
Then I can guess.

930
01:25:44,105 --> 01:25:45,345
So they got married?

931
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:48,343
When she returned from Ravensbruck.

932
01:25:51,012 --> 01:25:53,959
In the camp
she met Geneviéve de Gaulle.

933
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,254
She embraced Catholicism.

934
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,724
That's right.

935
01:25:58,086 --> 01:25:59,963
Heaven and Earth shall pass.

936
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:03,192
My words shall not pass.

937
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:53,786
For 4 years,
during the organized Resistance,

938
01:26:54,075 --> 01:26:57,579
money was reduced to a means.
No longer an end.

939
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:59,917
Listening to your music?

940
01:27:01,716 --> 01:27:04,595
"Spiegel im spiegel."
What's that mean?

941
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:06,821
"The mirror in the mirror."

942
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:08,500
It's late.

943
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:11,167
Where were you?

944
01:27:11,693 --> 01:27:14,537
With Godfather and the man
interviewing him.

945
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,799
Did I go overboard this morning?

946
01:27:17,332 --> 01:27:19,107
That's your business, sweetie.

947
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,677
True, I'm ignorant about movies.

948
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:26,144
Godfather told me
to give you this book.

949
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:27,785
What is it?

950
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:31,850
Robert Bresson,
"Notes on the Cinematograph."

951
01:27:37,118 --> 01:27:38,188
Listen to this...

952
01:27:39,387 --> 01:27:41,367
"Director:

953
01:27:41,756 --> 01:27:44,293
It's not a question
of directing someone

954
01:27:44,525 --> 01:27:46,402
but of directing oneself."

955
01:27:54,102 --> 01:27:55,240
And this...

956
01:27:56,471 --> 01:27:59,350
"Be sure to exhaust
what can be communicated

957
01:27:59,574 --> 01:28:01,884
by stillness and silence."

958
01:28:09,083 --> 01:28:10,221
And this...

959
01:28:10,918 --> 01:28:14,058
"Let feelings bring about events,

960
01:28:14,656 --> 01:28:16,033
not the contrary."

961
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:20,839
You and Grandpa made a decision.

962
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:23,899
Is it for the money?

963
01:28:25,767 --> 01:28:27,610
If it goes through, what's it for?

964
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,511
Obviously anything I can say
is pointless.

965
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,726
What are you thinking about,
Grandma?

966
01:28:41,916 --> 01:28:46,422
When I was in the U.S. and they
asked me, the young French student,

967
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:50,363
to speak about wartime France
and the concentration camps,

968
01:28:50,591 --> 01:28:53,367
I think I did so without any trouble.

969
01:28:53,628 --> 01:28:56,302
I always rattled off the same memories.

970
01:28:56,531 --> 01:29:00,638
People reacted like they do now
in front of their TV sets.

971
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:02,939
My words weren't heartfelt.

972
01:29:08,776 --> 01:29:10,449
Want to hear the record again?

973
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,120
You know,

974
01:29:17,618 --> 01:29:19,996
there's a question
I never dared ask you.

975
01:29:20,955 --> 01:29:22,628
Nor Grandpa.

976
01:29:26,561 --> 01:29:30,065
Why did you keep your code name,
and not your real one?

977
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,804
My name is Samuel.

978
01:29:34,736 --> 01:29:36,738
Dad's was, too.

979
01:29:37,138 --> 01:29:39,448
Why do you still call yourself Bayard?

980
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,990
During the war, sure, but afterward?

981
01:29:51,319 --> 01:29:52,662
I'm going to bed.

982
01:30:22,917 --> 01:30:26,296
Every desire must meet its lassitude,

983
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:28,665
its truth.

984
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:31,498
We're all jesters.

985
01:30:31,726 --> 01:30:34,798
We outlive our problems.

986
01:30:36,130 --> 01:30:38,007
Action and reaction,

987
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,137
the oldest couple in history.

988
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:46,251
You told the Americans that?

989
01:30:46,474 --> 01:30:50,547
And also that we originated
our search for origins.

990
01:30:50,678 --> 01:30:53,557
And that was
the Resistance's originality.

991
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:57,686
- You said that?
- And that I held to Péguy's plan:

992
01:30:57,819 --> 01:31:00,390
Not to relax too soon.

993
01:31:16,437 --> 01:31:18,178
I'm also thinking about love.

994
01:31:18,906 --> 01:31:20,579
Courtly love.

995
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:24,679
They say it was the French
but it went on at court,

996
01:31:26,981 --> 01:31:30,793
the court of the king of England,
Henry ll.

997
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:33,929
Essentially in Anjou,

998
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:37,036
in Normandy,
in the duchy of Aquitaine.

999
01:31:38,693 --> 01:31:40,604
Alienor was his wife.

1000
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:45,700
Again, the originality of modern France
is defined by its origins.

1001
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:48,637
In any case,

1002
01:31:48,769 --> 01:31:51,716
its highly original ties with England...

1003
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:55,014
Hence,

1004
01:31:56,043 --> 01:31:58,284
perhaps, despite what everyone says,

1005
01:31:58,513 --> 01:32:00,254
with America as well.

1006
01:32:00,882 --> 01:32:03,055
England is the refuge

1007
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:07,661
for everything that is
resistance to revolution.

1008
01:32:07,889 --> 01:32:12,304
The England of Pitt and Burke,
yes, it's natural.

1009
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,473
The ties are historical, geographic,

1010
01:32:15,696 --> 01:32:17,835
and political.

1011
01:32:18,733 --> 01:32:21,646
Brittany, Great Britain. There's a tie.

1012
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,849
I'll see what I can do.

1013
01:32:25,506 --> 01:32:28,180
A petition to dub "Matrix"
into Breton.

1014
01:32:28,409 --> 01:32:31,185
Image and sound are vital to History,

1015
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:35,121
and most important
is that basic element:

1016
01:32:35,349 --> 01:32:38,353
not knowing how History will end.

1017
01:32:53,701 --> 01:32:55,612
You're not very talkative.

1018
01:32:57,104 --> 01:32:59,448
I'm going through a hard time.

1019
01:33:00,374 --> 01:33:02,217
I broke up with my girlfriend.

1020
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,321
We'd been together for 10 years.

1021
01:33:07,214 --> 01:33:09,524
It's strange, in fact,

1022
01:33:10,585 --> 01:33:13,725
how things take on meaning
when the story ends.

1023
01:33:14,855 --> 01:33:17,301
It's because history is coming in.

1024
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:20,238
With a big H.

1025
01:33:35,376 --> 01:33:38,152
The fairy struck the frog
with her wand

1026
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:41,192
and suddenly the princess appeared.

1027
01:33:43,384 --> 01:33:45,660
The preterit creates a present image.

1028
01:33:53,260 --> 01:33:55,570
Every problem defiles a mystery.

1029
01:33:56,430 --> 01:33:59,570
In turn, the problem is defiled
by its solution.

1030
01:34:06,307 --> 01:34:08,014
It's not by chance.

1031
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:09,446
What do you mean?

1032
01:34:09,677 --> 01:34:14,023
There's the service entrance
and the main entrance.

1033
01:34:14,782 --> 01:34:18,025
They use the latter
for the apartment of the world

1034
01:34:19,186 --> 01:34:21,723
and leave us
the service entrance, sir.

1035
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:26,964
Words.

1036
01:34:28,696 --> 01:34:30,039
Through our use of speech,

1037
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:34,109
we come to realize how words
present us with ideas.

1038
01:34:34,335 --> 01:34:36,212
Man manufactures ideas.

1039
01:34:36,837 --> 01:34:38,942
He is an intrepid maker of ideas.

1040
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:46,652
A current condition results
from this faculty, Miss.

1041
01:34:47,348 --> 01:34:49,589
Do you know that saying
by Saint Augustine:

1042
01:34:50,785 --> 01:34:53,823
"The measure of love
is to love without measure"?

1043
01:35:05,566 --> 01:35:07,568
I'm thinking about something.

1044
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:12,810
When I think about something,

1045
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:15,782
in fact,

1046
01:35:16,977 --> 01:35:18,854
I'm thinking of something else.

1047
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,994
You can only think about something

1048
01:35:27,221 --> 01:35:29,827
if you think of something else.

1049
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:34,270
For instance,

1050
01:35:35,596 --> 01:35:38,099
I see a landscape that is new to me

1051
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:42,338
but it's new to me

1052
01:35:43,604 --> 01:35:46,380
because I mentally compare it

1053
01:35:47,074 --> 01:35:48,815
to another landscape,

1054
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:52,652
an older one,

1055
01:35:54,415 --> 01:35:55,553
one that I knew.

1056
01:36:35,923 --> 01:36:38,494
"Thus everything in my story wanes.

1057
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:44,440
As I am left with only images
of what happened so quickly,

1058
01:36:46,233 --> 01:36:48,440
I will go down to the Elysian Fields

1059
01:36:49,003 --> 01:36:51,677
with more shades than a man
has ever taken

1060
01:36:51,906 --> 01:36:53,214
with him."

1061
01:37:15,362 --> 01:37:18,206
And then these guys arrive.

1062
01:37:19,266 --> 01:37:20,939
Then she writes something.

1063
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:25,751
And if you were to be asked,
if you had the choice:

1064
01:37:26,106 --> 01:37:27,642
film, play, novel,

1065
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:30,382
or opera, which would you chose?

1066
01:37:37,284 --> 01:37:39,787
We have a project.

1067
01:37:40,721 --> 01:37:42,962
It relates something of the history...

1068
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,602
And this something

1069
01:37:47,027 --> 01:37:49,268
is one of the moments...

1070
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:53,940
And the first moment.

1071
01:37:54,501 --> 01:37:56,276
Do you remember the names?

1072
01:37:57,805 --> 01:37:59,307
Maybe nothing was said.

1073
01:38:01,175 --> 01:38:02,916
Maybe nothing was said.
