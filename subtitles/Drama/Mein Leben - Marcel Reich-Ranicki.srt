RAYNE:
MY MOTHER,

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,500
RAPED SEVERAL TIMES
BY MY FATHER,

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,700
A MONSTER WHO TRIED
TO RULE THE WORLD

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,900
FROM THE SHADOWS.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,200
A MONSTER I TRACKED THROUGH
THE DARKNESS, AND SLAUGHTERED.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,800
A MONSTER WHO UNWILLINGLY
PASSED HIS UNDEAD CURSE

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,300
TO HIS DAUGHTER.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,100
I AM THE ONE WHO WALKS
THROUGH THE WORLDS

10
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,300
OF THE HUMANS
AND THE VAMPIRES.

11
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,900
IN THE EARLY HALF
OF MY SECOND CENTURY,

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,700
THE WORLD ALLOWED ANOTHER
MONSTER TO RISE TO POWER.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,100
A MAN WHO WALKED
AMONG THE HUMANS,

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:46,000
BUT WHOSE SOUL SNAKED
AMONGST THE DEMONS.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,500
FUELLED BY DESPERATION AND
THE RANTS OF AN IDEOLOGUE,

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,500
THE MAN'S POWER GREW QUICKLY
INTO A FORCE

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:57,100
THAT COULD NOT BE CONTAINED.

BUTCHERING MILLIONS,

20
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,600
WHILE HIS EVIL MANDATE
WAS CARRIED OUT

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,200

AS A CAUSE FOR MURDER.

THEY ARE SAFE
TO CARRY OUT THEIR PLANS.

NO ONE.

134
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,300
I NEED YOU TO STAY FOCUSED
RIGHT NOW.

CAN I COUNT ON YOU TO DO
AS I SAY AND STAY CLEARHEADED?

I MEAN,
HE'S SITTING THERE

138

AND BY ALL RIGHTS UNDER
THE SKY OF GOD

139
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,600
HE SHOULD BE DEAD-
SIR?

140
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,800

AND I SUGGEST
YOU USE THEM.

148
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,400
ARE WE EATING?
TONIGHT?

149
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,400
THE HEAT IS FINE.

150
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,700
YOU CAN'T RUSH BEANS
AND AS I SAID,

151
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
I REFUSE TO BURN
YOUR SUPPER.

152
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,900
EVEN WHEN
IT'S PIGS BLOOD?

153
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,300
YES-YES-YES-YES-YES.

154
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,200
I MEAN YOU DID GET ME BLOOD,

155
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,500
I DON'T MEAN TO BE
UNGRATEFUL.

156
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,500
WELL, THEN IT CERTAINLY
COMES EFFORTLESSLY TO YOU.

OH, A CRACK IN THE VENEER.

159
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,700
AND HERE WE WERE,

WORRIED OUR DHAMPHIR

161
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,100
WOULD BE JUST A HUMORLESS
KILLING MACHINE.

162
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,400
HOW MANY TRAINS,
DO YOU FIGURE?

163
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,200
AS MANY AS THEY FEEL
ARE NECESSARY.

164
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:29,000
I'VE HEARD THEY'VE COMPLETELY
EMPTIED SOME OF THE GHETTOS.

165
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,500
DO YOU KNOW THE ODDS
ARE AGAINST US, NATHANIEL,

166
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,700
THAT THE GERMANS GET STRONGER
WHILE WE DWINDLE AWAY?

167
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,200
WE'RE LOSING.

168
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,300
WHILE WE'RE OUT HERE BEING
PICKED OFF

169
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
LIKE RATS IN CAGE.

170
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,000
WELL, THAT'S A PARTICULARLY
CHEERFUL THOUGHT.

171
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,300
I KEEP THINKING ABOUT
THE PEOPLE ON THE TRAIN.

172
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,200
WHO WE SAVED.

173
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
AND WHAT ABOUT THE NEXT ONE
AND THE ONE AFTER THAT?

174
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,100
IT NEVER ENDS.

175
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,100
WE DO WHAT WE CAN,
IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

176
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,700
THE REST YOU
HAVE TO LET IT GO.

177
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,500
I'VE NEVER BEEN THE ONE
TO 'LET THINGS GO'.

178
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,600
NO,
YOU CERTAINLY HAVEN'T.

179
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,300
MY SAUCE IS GETTING HOT.

180
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,100
IS OUR DHAMPHIR
NOT STAYING?

181
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,500
I'VE LOST MY APPETITE.

182
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,100
RIGHT.

183
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,700
APPARENTLY I BURNED
THE BLOOD.

184
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,400
(MACHINE WHIRS)

185
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:25,000
SHIT.

186
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,700
GET OUT!

187
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,600
(ENGINE WHIRS)

188
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,800
THIS IS AN HONOR.

189
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,900
YOUR CAMP IS TOO DARK.

190
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
DIRECTOR:
SLOVAKIAN GENERATORS,
OR SOME SUCH NONSENSE.

191
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,800
I TRUST YOU RECEIVED
MY COMMUNIQUE?

192
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,300
OF COURSE,

193
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,700
SILLY MAN.

194
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,000
JUST A MOMENT.

195
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
(GUNSHOT)

196
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,300
THE DOCTOR IS IN HIS LAB.

197
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,600
(PAINED GRUNT)

198
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,400
LIEUTENANT:
DOCTOR?

199
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,600
OH MY GOD!

200
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.

201
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,400
THERE ARE A PLETHORA
OF USELESS DEITIES

202
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,900
TO WORSHIP,
LIEUTENANT,

203
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,300
IF YOU'RE SO INCLINED.

204
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,500
THIS IS CERTAINLY
NOT ONE OF THEM.

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,900
(EXHALES)

206
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,200
IS THAT A VAMPIRE?

207
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
DOCTOR:
INDEED.

208
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,000
OUR NIGHT PATROL
CAUGHT IT SCROUNGING

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,300
NEAR THE WEST FENCE
A COUPLE OF NIGHTS AGO.

210
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,500
UNPRECEDENTED HAPPENSTANCE.

211
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,000
I BELIEVE IT WAS A GYPSY
AT ONE TIME,

212
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,900
BUT WHO'S TO SAY?

213
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,400
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE.

214
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,200
WHICH IS WHY
YOU'RE ALIVE.

215
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,600
THESE CREATURES
NO LONGER HAVE ANY BONDS

216
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,200
TO THE MORAL LAWS OF MAN,

217
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,700
WHICH IS WHY
YOU NEVER TRUST A VAMPIRE.

218
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,500
(PAINED GRUNTING)

219
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,100
MUST YOU SAVAGE HIM
IN MY PRESENCE?

220
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,600
"IT", LIEUTENANT.
"IT".

221
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:17,500
I AM JUST TESTING
ITS RESILIENCY.

222
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,200
AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
I BELIEVE,
THIS CREATURE,

224
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,600
IS ONE RESILIENT SPECIMEN.

225
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,700
(SNARLING)

226
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,100
OUTSIDE! NOW!

227
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,400
I'LL BE BACK.

228
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,100
(EXHALES)

229
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,800
I HAVE NO AUTHORITY
IN THESE MATTERS,

230
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,900
BUT I WON'T STAND IDLY
BY WHILE YOU KILL THAT,

231
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,600
CREATURE, AS PART OF SOME
MANDATED EXPERIMENT OF YOURS,

232
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,400
DOCTOR!

233
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,300
THE FASCINATING CAVEAT,
LIEUTENANT,

234
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,000
IS THAT THEY ARE VERY
DIFFICULT TO KILL.

235
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,900
ONLY BY STAKE, FIRE,
SUNLIGHT, OR HOLY WATER.

236
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,000
THE VAMPIRE WILL STAY
RESPONSIVE FOREVER.

237
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,200
IT'S A MARVEL OF SCIENCE.

238
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,700
I AM ON THE CUSP
OF GREAT DISCOVERIES

239
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,500
IN THE AVENUES OF LONGEVITY.

240
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,200
DISCOVERIES WHOSE APPLICATION

241
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,100
WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE
BETTERMENT OF THE REICH,

242
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,400
TO THE LEADERS OF THE REICH.

243
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:14,700
YOU SEE, I BELIEVE I CAN
MAKE HITLER IMMORTAL.

244
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,800
THERE'S BEEN
AN INCIDENT.

245
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,900
PACK A TRAVEL BAG,
WE LEAVE IN TWENTY MINUTES.

246
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,600
I'M SORRY MY WORK HERE
NEEDS ME TO PERSEVERE.

247
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,600
I HAVE TRY-

248
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,800
MY DEAR BOY!

249
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,400
WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND?

250
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,300
TWENTY MINUTES.

251
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,800
(LOUD WHOOSH)

252
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:57,300
(CROWS CROW)

253
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,400
WELL, IT IS DONE.
NOW WE WAIT.

254
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,100
"WE WAIT?"

255
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,800
NEED RESOLVE, DOCTOR!

256
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,500
WHAT CAN I TELL YOU?

257
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,600
IT'S A SCIENCE I DON'T
UNDERSTAND -

258
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,000
THAT'S WHAT I CAN
TELL YOU!

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,100
I NEED TO KNOW
HOW THAT MAN -

260
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,300
A MAN I'VE WORKED WITH
FOR THREE YEARS, I'LL ADD,

261
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,300
HOW THAT MAN COULD HAVE BEEN
IMPALED STRAIGHT THROUGH

262
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,400
AND STILL BE ALIVE!

263
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,500
HE'S NOW A VAMPIRE!

264
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,500
I KNOW HE'S A VAMPIRE!

265
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:41,200
THEN YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
ALTHOUGH IT'S BADLY INJURED,

266
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,600
IT WILL EVENTUALLY HEAL
FROM HAVING THE BAR REMOVED.

267
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:47,400
I WOULD SUGGEST BEFORE
THAT HAPPENS

268
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,400
YOU HAVE IT IN RESTRAINTS.

269
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,300
OR CUT IT'S HEAD OFF.
OR BOTH.

270
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,700
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

271
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:57,500
HE'S VAMPIRE, LIEUTENANT.
NOSFERATU.

272
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,000
I'M RATHER SHOCKED A LIEUTENANT
IN THE FUHRER'S ARMY

273
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,800
IS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME
UNDERSTANDING THIS BASIC FACT.

274
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
HE'S BEEN INFECTED,

275
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,900
AND THE QUICKER YOU SAY GOODBYE
TO YOUR OLD FRIEND

276
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,300
AND DISPOSE OF IT -

277
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,100
THE SAFER YOU
AND YOUR MEN WILL BE.

278
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,200
IT WILL BE UP AND MOVING
SOONER THAN LATER.

279
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
NOW I CAME HERE -

280
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,300
I PUT MYSELF OUT TO COME
HERE ON THE PREMISE

281
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,400
THAT YOU HAD FOUND
SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY.

282
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,200
EXTRAORDINARY, LIEUTENANT!

283
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,000
NOW WHOEVER THAT WAS IN
ITS PREVIOUS LIFE

284
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
IS NOW A COMMON VAMPIRE.

285
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,900
AND THAT IN ITSELF
IS NOT EXTRAORDINARY.

286
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,500
NEEDLESS TO SAY,
I EXPECT A CAR, IMMEDIATELY!

287
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,100
LIEUTENANT:
DOCTOR!

288
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,300
THE ASSAULT ON THE TRAIN...

289
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
IT HAPPENED IN DAYLIGHT.

290
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,900
(SWARDS CLANK)

291
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,800
DOCTOR:
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION,
LIEUTENANT.

292
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:20,800
THIS CREATURE THAT RAVAGED
YOUR MEN AT THE TRAIN,

293
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,500
DID IT MOVE
LIKE A VAMPIRE?

294
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,000
WELL, I DIDN'T SEE HER -
I WASN'T THERE,

295
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,400
BUT YES,
FROM ALL ACCOUNTS.

296
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,800
THEY LEFT TWO MEN ALIVE,

297
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,700
ALIVE LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE US
THE INFORMATION WE HAVE.

298
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,800
THIS CREATURE
PERPLEXES ME.

299
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,500
I SUGGEST WE FOCUS
ON THE MORE PRESSING MATTER.

300
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,100
BUT DON'T YOU SEE?
THEY'RE LINKED.

301
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:39,000
IF THIS DAYWALKER SIRED
OUR COMMANDANT,

302
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,500
THERE IS A GREATER
LIKELIHOOD HE SHARES

303
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,500
SOME OF ITS CAPABILITIES.

304
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,600
THIS WILL CARRY MY RESEARCH
AHEAD TENFOLD.

305
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,200
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
YOUR RESEARCH, DOCTOR.

306
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,300
I'M GOING IN.

307
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,100
CAUTION, ABOVE ALL.

308
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,300
THE CREATURE HAS HAD
MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME

309
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,600
TO REGAIN ITS STRENGTH

310
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:00,200
MY STUDIES INDICATE THEY BECOME
INSTINCTUALLY AGGRESSIVE.

311
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,700
YOU EXPECT THAT TO WORK?

312
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,300
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT WILL WORK.

313
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
INTO THE BREACH.

314
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
I HAVE NO IDEA.

315
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
COMMANDER?

316
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,200
COMMANDANT:
(GROWLS)

317
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,800
I CAN HELP YOU
WITH YOUR TRANSITION!

318
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:53,300


319
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
(LAUGHING)

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,000
(CHATTER AND LAUGHING)

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,500
YOU ARE A MAGICIAN,
NINOSLAVA.

322
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,500
MASSEUSE:
(SCREAMING)

323
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,600
HELP ME!

324
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,100

MASSEUSE:

327
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,400
I WAS RELAXED!

00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
GET OUT!

329
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,200

00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
SOLDIER:
I SAID GET THE HELL

RAYNE :
YOU MEAN HERS,
DON'T YOU?

332
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,800
YOU'RE JUST A NAZI TOURIST.

333
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,300
YOU FILTHY CUNTS,
YOU NEVER LISTEN!

(FIGHTING, PAINED GRUNTS)

336
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,500
AGH!

337
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,800
I CAN'T PUNISH YOU
FOR THE LEGIONS OF WOMEN

338
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,900
WHO HAVE BEEN BRUTALIZED
BY MEN,

339
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,200
BUT I WILL GIVE IT
MY BEST SHOT.

340
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,600
(PAINED GRUNT)

341
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,700
LET'S GO.

342
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,600
YOU'LL WANT TO LOCK
THAT DOOR.

343
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,200
GO, SHUT THE FRONT DOOR,
WE'RE CLOSING EARLY TODAY.

344
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,500
GO!
BUT THE GERMANS WILL KNOW
SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED.

345
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:29,300
YOU WILL LISTEN WHEN I ASK
YOU TO DO SOMETHING!

346
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
YOUR AGGRESSIVE ENCOUNTER

347
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,600
HAD BETTER NOT BE
PROBLEMATIC FOR ME.

348
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,900
PLEASANT.

349
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:51,900


350
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500

353
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,900
YOU TOLD ME,

YOU GAVE ME YOUR ASSURANCES!

356
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,500
IT'S UNKNOWN!

357
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,200
I ONLY KNOW
WHAT I'VE LEARNED.

358
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,100
COMMANDANT:
LOOK AT ME.
LOOK AT ME!

359
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,900
WE HAVE TO MAKE
A DECISION.

(DOOR SLAMS)

361
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,800
WE WILL TAKE ACTION,

362
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,300
IF AND WHEN I AUTHORIZE IT.

363

IF AND WHEN I AUTHORIZE IT!

NO, NO, NO,

I ALREADY HAD MY MASSAGE.

369

384
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,700
THE WHORE FROM
THE BORDELLO, SIR.

385
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,500
WELL, SPIT IT OUT, GIRL.

386
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,500
THIS INFORMATION IS
FOR THE COMMANDANT HIMSELF.

387
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,500
I WILL DECIDE WHAT INFORMATION
PASSES TO THE COMMANDANT.

388
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,400
I'M SORRY TO HAVE
BOTHERED YOU.

389
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,700
UNLESS YOU'RE PREPARED
TO BE SHOT

390
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,000
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD
BY MY FRIEND I'D STOP!

391
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
GOOD.

392
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,500
I MAY HAVE UNDER
ESTIMATED YOUR VALUE.

393
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,500
I'M SURE THE COMMANDANT
WILL BE QUITE EAGER

394
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,700
TO HEAR WHAT
YOU HAVE TO SAY.

395
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,000
AND WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
FOR THIS DO DOUBT

396

00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:23,400
AT THE BORDELLO,
THERE IS A WOMAN I WORK FOR.

398
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,800
AND I HATE HER.

399
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,100
I WANT TO RUN
THE BUSINESS.

400
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,300
I WANT HER TO GO AWAY.

401
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200

(GROANS)

404
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,600
YOU ONLY GET ONE KICK
AT THE CAN IN THIS LIFE.

405
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,900
(MOANING)

406
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,300
OH YEAH, RIGHT THERE.

SVETLANA:
IS THE COMMANDANT
NOT ALL RIGHT?

411
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,300
COMMANDANT:
I AM MORE THAN ALL RIGHT.

412
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
YOUR COMMANDANT
IS MERELY GOING THROUGH

413
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,500
A METAMORPHOSIS OF LATE.

414
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,800
A TRANSITIONAL PHASE.

415
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,000

THE PLEASURE OF YOUR...

416
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,700
THE PLEASURE OF YOUR VISIT,

417
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:05,500
HERR COMMANDANT, I HAVE
NEWS OF THE WOMAN YOU SEEK.

418
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,100
I SEEK MANY WOMEN,
MY CHILD.

419
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,000
THERE'S TALK OF AN ATTACK
AT THE RAIL DEPOT YESTERDAY,

420
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
AND NOW THE GERMAN SOLDIER...

421
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,200
I KNOW SHE'S OF INTEREST.

422
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,400
SOLDIER?

423
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,100
AT THE BORDELLO,
WHERE I WORK.

424
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,300
I SEE.

425
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,100
HE NEARLY RAPED
A MASSEUSE,

426
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,600
AND THIS WOMAN HURT HIM.

427
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,300
DID SHE?

428
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,800
YES.

429
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,900
QUITE BADLY.
THE WORST, REALLY.

430
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:30,800
I SEE.

431
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,500
AND YOU KNOW WHERE

432
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:38,900
SHE'S STILL AT THE BORDELLO,
MEIN COMMANDANT.

433
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,600

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,000

438
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,900

439
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,600
MY CHILD THERE IS ONE MORE
THING YOU CAN DO TO HELP ME.

00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:17,200

00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,500

(FIGHTING GRUNTS)

446
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,200
COMMANDANT
SO, WE MEET AGAIN,
MY DEAR GIRL.

447
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,300
OR WOULD IT BE MORE
ACCURATE TO SAY,

448
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,700
DEAR MOTHER.

449
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,000
AGH!

450
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,200
STOP!

451
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,500
(GUNFIRE)

452
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,100
STOP!
SHE MUST NOT DIE!

453
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,500
WE NEED HER ALIVE!

454
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,500
I THINK WE GOT HER.

455
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,800
INSIDE!

456
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,700
I'VE GOT IT.

457
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,300
GOOD.

458
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,900
WHAT IS THAT?

459
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,500
THE COMMANDANT DRAINED
YOU AN HOUR AGO.

460
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,600
AN HOUR, GYPSY.

461
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,400
(HISSES)

462
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,000
YES, REMARKABLE HEALING
ABILITY.

463
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,500
I FEEL... DIFFERENT...
STRONGER...

464
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,800
DOCTOR:
OH, IMAGINE HOW POWERFUL
YOU'D FEEL

465
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,000
IF YOU WERE IMPERVIOUS
TO THIS.

466
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:08,400
A SIMPLE TEST.

467
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,300
YOU'VE INHERITED HIS IMMUNITY,
HOWEVER SLIGHT.

468
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,600
IF YOU WERE A REGULAR VAMPIRE,

469
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,200
THE HOLY WATER WOULD
HAVE CRUSHED YOU HAND

470
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,900
LIKE PAPER-MACHE.

471
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,000
BUT IMAGINE IF HOLY WATER
HAD ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT,

472
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,900
OR FIRE, OR WOODEN STAKE.

473
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,900
IMAGINE THE POSSIBILITIES.

474
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,300
YOUR BLOOD NOURISHED
THE COMMANDANT,

475
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,800
HELPED HIM WITH HIS HEALING.

476
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
A NECESSARY EXCHANGE.

477
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:41,200
WE MUST ALL MAKE SACRIFICES
TO BENEFIT THE FUHRER.

478
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,700
TIMES THEY ARE A-CHANGING
GYPSY.

479
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,700
WHY JUST YESTERDAY I THOUGHT
THE DAYWALKER WAS A MYTH,

480
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,600
A FIGMENT OF SCIENTIFIC
CONJUNCTURE.

481
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
BUT TODAY THE WORLD,
AS THEY SAY,

482
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,600
THE WORLD IN OUR OYSTER.

483
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,300
CHANGE IS INEVITABLE.

484
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,200
EVOLUTION, INEVITABLE.

485
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,500
THE FATHERLAND, INEVITABLE.

486
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,800
ROOK TAKES KNIGHT.

487
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,800
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO,
HERR DOCTOR?

488
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,700
DOCTOR?

489
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,900
DOCTOR?

490
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,300
I CAN'T HELP MYSELF,
DOCTOR...

491
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
IT'S THE DEVIL IN ME.

492
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,000
IT'S CURIOUS TO ME,
THIS CHANGE YOU'VE ENDURED.

493
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,300
I'VE STUDIED IT,

494
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,000
BUT I DON'T COMPREHEND
THE SCIENCE.

495
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,800
WHAT IF IT'S NOT SCIENCE?

496
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,700
WHAT IF IT'S SOMETHING
BIGGER THAN SCIENCE.

497
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,500
SCIENCE IS EVERYTHING!

498
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,000
AM I STILL YOUR FAVOURITE
SUBJECT?

499
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,000
YOU ARE CERTAINLY
THE MOST VERBOSE.

500
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:23,500
YOU'VE JETTISONED
YOUR HUMAN FOIBLES,

501
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,000
YOUR MORTAL COIL,
AS SHAKESPEARE CALLED IT.

502
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,800
SVETLANA:
HE SOUNDS LIKE A SMART MAN.

503
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,500
YOU'VE MANAGED TO SOMEHOW
BOTH EVOLVE

504
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
AND REGRESS AT THE SAME TIME.

505
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
SVETLANA:
YOU'RE CONFUSING TO ME,

506
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,500
I LIKE IT.

507
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,900
ON THE OTHER HAND,

508
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,100
YOU'VE BECOME SUBSERVIENT
TO YOUR PRIMORDIAL INSTINCTS.

509
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,700
WHAT ARE THOSE?

510
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,200
DOCTOR:
HUNGER, THIRST,

511
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,100
BLOODLUST,
SEXUAL URGE.

512
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:58,600
WITH MY NEW LIFE,
YOU'VE OBSERVED THREE

513
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
OF THE FOUR.

514
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,700
ARE YOU A GAMBLING MAN,
DOCTOR?

515
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,400
IT APPEARS THAT I AM.

516
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,300
SVETLANA:
TURN IT.

517
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,700
I KNOW,
YOU'RE DYING TO SEE

518
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,000
WHAT I AM CAPABLE OF,
DOCTOR.

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,000
(HISSES)

520
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
DOCTOR:
DON'T BE A FOOL.

521
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,500
(FIGHTING GRUNTS)

522
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,400
(HOLY WATER SIZZLES)
(SVETLANA SCREAMS)

523
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,000
AGH!

524
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,300
AHHHHH!

525
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,200
EVENTS BECAME UNRULY.

526
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,700
YEAH, SO IT SEEMS.

527
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,400
COMPOSE YOURSELF,
JOIN ME UPSTAIRS.

528
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,100
NATHANIEL:
IT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND.

529
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,100
RAYNE:
I NEED GRENADES.

530
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,500
I WAS SURE THAT YOU GUYS
HAD GRENADES.

531
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,500
NATHANIEL:
IT'S A FOOL'S ERRAND AND YOU'LL
ONLY GET YOURSELF KILLED.

532
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,800
RAYNE:
OKAY FORGET THE GRENADES,
I-I CAN USE DYNAMITE.

533
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,400
WHERE IS THE DYNAMITE?
WHERE IS THE DYNAMITE?

534
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,900
NATHANIEL:
RAYNE, STOP!

535
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:22,000
YOU'RE NOT GETTING DYNAMITE.

536
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,000
I'M GOING HOME,
TO SHARPEN MY KNIVES!

537
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,400
NATHANIEL:
YOU CAN'T RUSH
INTO A HORNETS' NEST

538
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
WHEN YOUR ONLY STRATEGY
IS TO CUT OFF HEADS.

539
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I CREATED HIM,
NATHANIEL!

540
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,200
BELIEVE ME WHEN I'VE
NEVER SIRED ANOTHER

541
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,400
I WILL NOT START
WITH A NAZI!

542
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,400
YOU DON'T KNOW WHETHER
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

543
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,900
WHEN I LEFT HIM,
HE WAS A KRAUT-KEBOB.

544
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,100
THIS MORNING HE WENT
TO THE BORDELLO

545
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,800
TO CAUSE AN ASSAULT
TO FIND ME!

546
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
I DRAINED HIM.

547
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,500
MY BLOOD MUST HAVE MIXED
WITH HIS.

548
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,900
THERE IS NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND

549
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:46,600
THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE
AND NOW I NEED TO DO

550
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,900
WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE.

551
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,800
HE ENDS TONIGHT!

552
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,500
LISTEN, I'M THE FIRST ONE
TO JUMP INTO A TEMPEST,

553
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT.

554
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,600
HE'S NOT JUST A VAMPIRE,
RAYNE, NOW HE'S A VAMPIRE

555
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,100
WITH AN ENTIRE GERMAN
ARMY BEHIND HIM.

556
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:01,200
NOW DESPITE HOW YOU DID
THINGS IN THE PAST,

557
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,800
WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER.

558
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,200
WORKING WITH A TEAM USUALLY
MEANS THE TEAM DIES.

559
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
THEN THAT'S OUR DECISION
TO MAKE.

560
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
NAZI DOGS!

561
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,300
WE HAVE SCOUTS WATCHING
THEIR MOVEMENTS AS WE SPEAK.

562
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,600
WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING SHORTLY.

563
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,300
WE WILL HANDLE THIS.

564
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,000
NATHANIEL I NEED YOU TO
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING,

565
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,300
I NEED YOUR MEN TO UNDERSTAND,

566
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,000
THAT I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE
LIFE HUNTING DOWN THE UNDEAD,

567
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,100
AND I PROMISE YOU

568
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,000
THAT IT'S ABOUT TO GET
SERIOUSLY FUCKING COMPLICATED.

569
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,000
GOOD.

570
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,100
I WAS SICK OF KILLING
JUST NAZIS.

571
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,400
AN UNDEAD'LL FIRE THINGS UP
AROUND HERE.

572
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,600
BE CAREFUL
WHAT YOU WISH FOR.

573
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,100
VASYL:
MAGDA WILL BE
IN POSITION SOON.

574
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,200
AND WHAT'RE YOU TWO UP TO?

575
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,100
NATHANIEL:
EFFORTS TOWARD
THE GREATER GOOD.

576
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,100
AND WHO'S MAGDA?

577
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:51,800
MAGDA:
(LAUGHS)

578
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,000
I KNOW YOU MISSED ME.

579
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,900
HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING
A LONG TIME?

580
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,400
(LAUGHS)

581
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,300
ARE YOU AFRAID
I STOLE SOME TISSUES?

582
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,100
DISTRICT LEADER:
COME COME, BE A GOOD GIRL.

583
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:16,800
DOES HE REALLY HAVE TO FEEL
ME UP EVERY TIME I NEED TO PEE?

584
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,900
THESE ARE TRYING MONTHS,
DEAR.

585
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,800
MY ASSOCIATE WANTS ME
TO ENJOY MY EVENING

586
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,400
WITH YOU AS MUCH I DO,

587
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,700
BUT THERE ARE SOME UNSAVORY
ELEMENTS LURKING ABOUT.

588
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,900
ELEMENTS WHO MIGHT HIDE
A WEAPON IN THAT TOILET,

589
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,900
(LAUGHS)

590
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,100
ELEMENTS WHO WOULD KILL
THE PAIR OF US

591
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,000
BECAUSE OF THE CLOTHES
ON OUR SKIN.

592
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,300
AND CLOTHES,
RARELY MAKE A MAN.

593
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,600
(LAUGHS)

594
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,500
AM I RIGHT? HUH?

595
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,700
(LAUGHS)

596
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:54,200
BARTENDER! MORE DRINKS.
WE'RE CELEBRATING.

597
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,700
BARTENDER:
ON THE HOUSE.

598
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,700

601
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,000
DROP IT! NOW!

602
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,600
I SUPPOSE TWO THOUGHTS
ARE VYING

603
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,800
FOR YOUR ATTENTION
RIGHT NOW.

604
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,300
ONE, "HOW IS MY NIGHT
GOING TO END?",

605
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,600
AND TWO,

606
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,800
"WHERE EXACTLY DID
SHE HAVE THAT GUN?"

607
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,000
L'CHAIM.

608
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,400
DURING THE DAY,
WE HAVE A BUSINESS TO RUN.

609
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,100
YOU UNDERSTAND.

610
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,900
NOW, WE WOULD VERY MUCH
LIKE TO TALK TO YOU,

611
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:16,100
ABOUT THESE CODES.

612
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
SO SHE'S A CODE BREAKER?

613
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,700
SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST
I'VE EVER SEEN.

614
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,600
HAVE YOU HEARD OF THE GERMAN'S
ENIGMA MACHINE?

615
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,800
SHOULD I HAVE?

616
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,800
NOT UNLESS YOU'RE IN
THE COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS.

617
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,200
SHE CRACKED AN ENIGMA CODE,

618
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,000
WHICH MEANS NOTHING UNLESS
YOU FOLLOW THAT SORT OF THING.

619
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,400
BUT AT ANY GIVEN MINUTE,

620
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,800
MAGDA KNOWS THE WHERE,
THE WHEN, AND THE HOW.

621
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,700
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE
GOT THINGS TIED UP.

622
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,100
I HAVE TO GO.

623
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,900
LOOKS LIKE WE BOTH
HAVE SOMEWHERE TO BE.

624
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,200
SEE YOU AROUND, RAYNE.

625
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,600
YEAH.

AGHHHHH!

639
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,200
AGH!

640
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,100
HELP ME TO CHANGE
THE WORLD.

DON'T I HAVE TO INVITE
YOU IN?

645
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:45,700
I DON'T BELIEVE IT WORKS
THAT WAY, LIEUTENANT.

I DON'T HAVE THE THIRST FOR IT
I ONCE HAD, LIEUTENANT.

648
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,300
NOW WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
MEIN COMMANDANT?

649
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,600
AS YOU KNOW, RECENT EVENTS
HAVE RE-DIRECTED

650
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
MY EFFORTS IN THIS WAR.

651
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,900
WHAT ONCE WAS IS NO LONGER.

652
00:44:04,900 --> 00:44:07,200
WE ARE NOW ABLE TO BRING
A NEW ARSENAL OF SKILLS

653
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,800
TO OUR STRATEGIES.

654
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,600
STRATEGIES THAT WE NEED
TO MOBILIZE

655
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,600
FOR THE DIFFICULT
ROAD AHEAD.

656
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,900
AND HOW AM I ABLE
TO BETTER ASSIST THE CAUSE?

657
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,700
YOUR TRACKING SKILLS,
LIEUTENANT, ARE UNSURPASSED.

658
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:20,000
I HAVE WITNESSED FANTASTIC
RESULTS

659
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,700
FROM YOU OVER THE YEARS.

660
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,200
NOT TO SOUND ABRUPT, SIR,

661
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,200
BUT WHAT IS IT
ABOUT MY ABILITIES,

662
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,900
TRACKING OR OTHERWISE,

663
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,800
THAT LENDS ITSELF TO A VISIT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

664
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:33,100
LIEUTENANT,

665
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,300
YOU CAN BE SO MUCH MORE.

666
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,500
NEVER!

667
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,600
AGH!

668
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,900
(PANTING)

669
00:44:57,700 --> 00:44:59,800
(PANTING)

670
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,500
CHRIST!

671
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,900
DON'T YOU KNOW NOT TO SNEAK
AROUND A DHAMPHIR'S LAIR?

672
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,900
OKAY.

673
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:13,000
HOW DID YOU KNOW
I WAS HERE?

674
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,900
DON'T HAVE TO BE A BLOOD-HOUND
TO FIND YOU.

675
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,400
I CAN'T GET WARM.

676
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,400
THAT WILL PASS.

677
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,700
IS IT DONE?

678
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,500
IN A FEW MINUTES,
WE WILL BE ONE,

679
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,900
THE LIEUTENANT AND I.

680
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,400
CAN HE BE TRUSTED?

681
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,100
(SNIFFS)

682
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,800
NOW MORE THAN EVER.

683
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,000
(SNIFFS)

684
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,200
THIS IS THE DHAMPHIR'S SCENT,
LIEUTENANT.

685
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,200
FIND HER, TONIGHT.

686
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,800
ALIVE.

687
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:46,500
FASCINATING TRANSFORMATION.

688
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,200
HEIL HITLER.

689
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:09,400
THAT WAS QUITE A COLD-HEARTED
EXECUTION BACK THERE.

690
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
HAD THAT IN YOU.

691
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
YES.

692
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,400
HE PUT HIMSELF IN THAT
SITUATION

693
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:19,200
AS SOON AS HE DONNED JACKBOOTS
AND FELL INTO RANK AND FILE.

694
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,200
"DONNED"?

695
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,200
YES, DONNED.

696
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:25,500
I AM CONSIDERABLY OLDER
THAN YOU, NATHANIEL.

697
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,900
YES, BUT STILL...
DONNED...

698
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,000
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

699
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,200
WHO'S THAT?

700
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,300
IT'S VASYL,
ONE OF OUR MEN.

701
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,400
YOU INVITED VASYL
HERE TO MY HIDEOUT?

702
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:48,500
HE MISSES YOU.

703
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:51,400
I'M SURPRISED YOUR KIND
HAS SURVIVED THIS LONG.

704
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,300
AS LONG AS YOU ARE HERE,

705
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,900
I THINK THAT WE HAVE
A MAJOR PROBLEM.

706
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:01,800
VASYL:
STAY THERE.

707
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,600
RAYNE:
I BELIEVE THE COMMANDANT
IS BRINGING

708
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,400
HIS FREAK SHOW TO BERLIN.

709
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:09,500
VASYL:
TO CREATE AN ARMY.

710
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,000
RAYNE:
AN UNDEAD ARMY RUN
BY THE MAN HIMSELF.

711
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:13,600
NATHANIEL:
THEY'LL BE LUCKY TO MAKE IT
TO BERLIN.

712
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,600
RAYNE:
WE CAN'T JUST RELY
ON LUCK ITSELF.

713
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,500
(SIGHS)
WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?

714
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,200
WE'VE GOT COMPANY.

715
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,600
DHAMPHIR!

(FIGHTING GRUNTS)

717
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:29,400
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO US?

718
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,400
TO ME?

719
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,500
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

720
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:33,900
(FIGHTING GRUNTS)

721
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,600

WHAT AM I?

00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,800
(FIGHTING GRUNTS)

723
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,100
NATHANIEL,
GET OUT OF HERE!

724
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:55,400
AGH!

725
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,100
(HISSES)

726
00:49:02,100 --> 00:49:04,100
NATHANIEL:

727
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,100
AGH!

(EFFORT GRUNTS)

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,200
NATHANIEL:
HEY VASYL!

730
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:16,700
RAYNE:
STOP IT!

731
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,300
WE NEED HIM
IN LESS PIECES.

732
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,300
SPEAK IF YOU CAN.

733
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:29,900
THEY WANTED ME TO FIND YOU,

734
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,800
TO FIND ALL OF YOU.

735
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:34,600
HE FED ON ME.

736
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,700
THE COMMANDANT?

737
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,500
HE WAS MY FRIEND...

738
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,300
WHY WOULD HE TAKE
YOUR BLOOD

739
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,800
WHEN HE HAS TRAINS
FULL OF VICTIMS

740
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:44,500
IF HE WANTED THAT?

741
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,300
I'M THE TRACKER.

742
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,900
HOW MANY HAS HE TURNED?

743
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,000
LIEUTENANT: I FOLLOWED HIM...
NATHANIEL: HOW MANY?!

744
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,100
WHERE DID YOU FOLLOW
HIM FROM?

745
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:54,100
FROM THE WHORE.

746
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,500
HIS SMELL WAS ON
THE WHORE'S CLOTHING.

747
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,200
TO THE CODE-BREAKER,
AND NOW TO YOU DHAMPHIR.

748
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,200
NATHANIEL:
MAGDA! MAGDA!

749
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,400
YOU FUCKING MURDERING
BASTARDS!

750
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,200
HOLD IT! WE WON'T GET
ANYTHING ELSE FROM HIM

751
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,400
IF HE'S DEAD!
"IF" HE DIES?!

752
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:12,200
IF THEY'VE GOT MAGDA,

753
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,100
THEY'VE THEY'VE GOT
EVERYTHING, RAYNE!

754
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,800
THEY'VE GOT ALLIED
TROOP POSITIONS,

755
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,600
THEY'VE GOT FUCKING
SAFE HOUSE ADDRESSES,

756
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:19,700
THEY'VE GOT FUCKING
AGENT NAMES!

00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,600
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,

758
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,100
HOW ARE YOU GOING
TO MAKE IT TO BERLIN

759
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,300
IF I CUT OFF
YOUR HEAD?!

760
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:27,300
WHERE DID THEY TAKE HER?

761
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,200
NOWHERE YET,

762
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:31,100
BUT THEY WILL BE
SENDING HER

763
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,300
WHERE THEY ARE SHIPPING
ALL OF THE REST OF THEM.

764
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:36,900
GO! THE TAVERN!
SEND THE ALERT!

765
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,000
IS THAT EVERYTHING?

766
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,500
YEAH.

767
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,900
AGH!

GETS UGLY.

772
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,300
STOP!

00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,000

00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,600
HA!

776
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,300
FALL BACK!

777
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,100
NATHANIEL:
FALL BACK!

778
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,100
MAGDA:
WHO'S THERE?

779
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,400
LET'S GET THIS OVER
WITH NAZI FILTH!

780
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,800
COMMANDANT:
I'VE BEEN RATHER
PHILOSOPHICAL LATELY.

781
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:59,200
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GREAT ARTISTS

782
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,300
LIKE WAGNER, OR BACH,

783
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:06,000
OR, MAYBE THE MAN WHO DESIGNED
THE CHURCH FOR THIS TOWN.

784
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,700
THESE GREAT ARTISTS,

785
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,300
THEY TRICKED THE GODS INTO
GRANTING THEM IMMORTALITY.

786
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,200
THEY TRICKED THE GODS.

787
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:19,500
IMMORTALITY, THAT ELUSIVE HARE
THAT OUTWITS US ALL.

788
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,600
BUT IN TWO HUNDRED YEARS,

789
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:25,800
I MIGHT RETURN TO THIS TOWN
AND TO GAZE UPON THAT CHURCH,

790
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,100
BECAUSE I AM NOW IMMORTAL,
CODE-BREAKER.

791
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:32,300
I, AM NOW THE TRICK
PERSONIFIED,

792
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,900
THAT HAS BEEN PLAYED
ON THE GODS.

793
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:39,000
IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO SCARE ME?

794
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,200
AGH!

795
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:49,500
NATHANIEL:
THIS SHOULDN'T
HAVE HAPPENED!

796
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,400
WE LET OUR GUARD DOWN!

797
00:52:58,200 --> 00:52:59,600
WE SHOULD HAVE FUCKING
HAD HER!

798
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:00,900
RAYNE:
WE MISSED HER, NATHANIEL!

799
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,900
IT HAPPENS IN WAR!
PEOPLE DIE!

800
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:04,700
NATHANIEL:
DON'T YOU LECTURE ME
ON THE PRICE OF THIS WAR

801
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,400
AND ON HUMAN LIVES, VAMPIRE!

802
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,200
AND DO NOT YOU LECTURE ME
ON UNDEAD VERMIN

803
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,800
THAT I'VE HUNTED
ALL MY LIFE!

804
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,000
EMOTIONS RUN HIGH,
AND THEY SHOULD.

805
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,300
BUT UNLESS THE LIEUTENANT
WAS PLAYING GAMES,

806
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:18,800
I SUGGEST WE GET
TO THE RAIL DEPOT

807
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,300
BEFORE THE TRAIN LEAVES
WITH YOUR MAGDA

808
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,900
AND THOSE NAZI FUCKS
GAIN MORE GROUND.

809
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,700
NATHANIEL:
THE THREE OF US AND SIX MEN?

810
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,900
WE HAVE ONE SHOT AT THIS,
YOU KNOW.

811
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,700
THEN LET'S MAKE IT
UNFORGETTABLE.

812
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:35,500
HOW MANY HAVE I CUT DOWN?

813
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:39,100
HOW MANY OF THE UNHOLY
HAVE I SLAUGHTERED?

814
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,400
I HAVE STAINED THE CENTURIES
WITH THEIR BLOOD.

815
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,700
NOW THE CREATURES OF THE DARK
HAVE EMERGED

816
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,300
FROM THE SHADOWS,

817
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,700
NOW THEY WALK AMONG US,

818
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,700
AND TAKE THEIR VICTIMS
ON A WHIM - MAGDA.

819
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,700
THE INNOCENT ARE PULLED
INTO THE DARK ABYSS

820
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,500
BY THE WRETCHED,

821
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:59,400
AND THE CYCLE OF BLOODSHED
CONTINUES THROUGH THE AGES.

822
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:03,600
WHEN WILL WE FINALLY
COMPREHEND OUR INHUMANITY?

823
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,200
AS WE GAZE ACROSS
OUR BATTLEFIELDS,

824
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,700
FLUSH WITH CORPSES AND HEADY
WITH THE SPOILS OF WAR,

825
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:14,200
CAN WE EVER HOPE TO REALIZE
THAT WHICH WE HAVE LOST?

826
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,300
THE UNHOLY LURCH THROUGH
THE COUNTRYSIDE

827
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,500
IN SEARCH OF THEIR PREY.

828
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,800
PERHAPS OUR SALVATION,
OUR PEACE,

829
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,800

830
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:27,600
FOR IT IS ALL THEY
HAVE EVER KNOW.

831
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,000
IT IS ALL THAT I HAVE
EVER KNOWN.

832
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:32,000
