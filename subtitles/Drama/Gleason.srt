...going on with me recently. Um....

165

I've been having some
muscle twitching in my arms.

Mostly my upper arms,
shoulders on both sides.

a little bit concerned about it.

He spoke about these types
of symptoms on three levels.

00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,464
It could be some type
of molecular problem...

of mechanical problem...

He was a reader, pretty cerebral.

391
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:57,108
He wasn't an introvert,
but he was more on the quiet side.

392
00:22:57,275 --> 00:22:59,073
I can remember he was
about 6 years old...

393
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:01,212
...and I had him in the backyard.

394
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,940
He was at the farthest end
of the lot in the backyard.

395
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:06,881
I bought him a Wiffle ball
and a bat.

396
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,214
I said, "Now, Steve,
keep your eye on the ball...

397
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,654
...and watch the ball hit the bat."

398
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:14,349
So I tossed it to him.

399
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:17,553
First time he swung the bat,
he hit the ball over the house.

are the fuel for the fire.

I just want to say
I feel like I'm exploding on the inside.

1865
01:50:12,272 --> 01:50:14,503
I love you so much, man...

1866
01:50:14,674 --> 01:50:18,668
...and that's a great thing...

1867
01:50:18,845 --> 01:50:21,110
...and I hope...

1868
01:50:21,281 --> 01:50:23,773
...you love me
as much as I love you...

I hope you love your children...

1871
01:50:29,055 --> 01:50:32,958
...as much as I love you.
