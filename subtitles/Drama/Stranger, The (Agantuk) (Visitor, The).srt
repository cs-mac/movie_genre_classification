ආයුබෝ වේවා!

<i>Time: Sengoku Era (~1493 - 1598),
a time when Japan was divided

4
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,270
<i>into many warring providences
each ruled by a feudal lord

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,900
<i>Location: AKAIKE 
a small and poor providence by the sea

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,550
<i>which was ruled by the Ming at the time.

8
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,600
Doshi, Kamou, the crates!

9
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,800
Keep firing!  Keep firing!

10
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:03,100
Against those numbers, 
<i><b><u>Lord Rarou (Luo-Lang)</b></u> alone is enough.

11
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
Both crates are safe.

12
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,900
Is this the level of
swordsmen in this country?

13
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,300
Akaike Providence

14
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,600
Why don't you draw?

15
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Is your blade a fake?

16
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:56,610

<i>Akaomi</i> Nanashi  [Nanashi=Nameless]

18
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,700
It's taken many years...

19
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,000
To get Byakuran before us,

20
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,200
When the source of
immortality is in his hands,

21
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:23,800
The Emperor will be most pleased.

22
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:17,000
That was a long wait... we finally meet.

23
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,900
Afraid?

24
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:06,800
Pretending that you don't understand?
Or are you so afraid you can't speak?

25
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:08,500
Everyone eventually dies.

26
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:14,100
There's no one with infinite
time in this world.

27
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,700
Even you'll live strongly in
the time that's left for you.

28
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,000
If you're going to kill
me, hurry up and do it!

29
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:24,200
Don't rush to your death, I
have something I must ask you.

30
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,900
When you were taken from the temple,
there was a man who tried to save you.

31
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,500
A friend?

32
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:32,800
No idea.

33
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,900
Answer honestly.

34
01:09:35,700 --> 01:09:37,800
I don't have any friends!

35
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:42,300
It seems like I won't
get an answer from you.

36
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,300
It doesn't matter... that man
was killed by my comrades.

37
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:35,800
Bastard!

38
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,500
That's what you deserve!

39
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,100
I wouldn't try.

40
01:19:12,900 --> 01:19:14,900
I'm enough of an
opponent for all of you!

41
01:22:36,900 --> 01:22:38,800
That guy...

42
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:46,700
Use this....

This is the first time
I've ever been cut.

52
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,500
The pain of a sword,

53
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:36,500
Somehow... strange...

54
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:39,000
Strange!..

55
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:46,000
