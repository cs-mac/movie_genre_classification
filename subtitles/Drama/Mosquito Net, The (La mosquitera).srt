1
00:01:07,508 --> 00:01:10,602
Well, thanks for the information.
I appreciate it.

2
00:01:10,678 --> 00:01:14,307
There's no chance a mistake
could've been made? A misreading?

3
00:01:14,382 --> 00:01:17,010
Human error? It happens.

4
00:01:17,085 --> 00:01:21,385
Oh. Well, that sort of
rules that out then, doesn't it?

5
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:24,084
So this really is reality.

6
00:01:27,795 --> 00:01:30,923
Mr. Secretary, your car.

7
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:33,365
Oh, yes. Thank you.

8
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,746
Eddie, let's take the parkway.

9
00:01:55,623 --> 00:01:58,751
Okay, buddy. Final offer.
Nonnegotiable.

10
00:01:58,826 --> 00:02:01,522
For every buckle-down hour
you give Algebra Two...

11
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:05,032
you get two with quality time
with Nintendo and Sega.

12
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:09,832
Deal? Just whatever you do,
don't tell your mother.

13
00:02:09,904 --> 00:02:12,395
Good. Now, put her back on.

14
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:19,206
Okay, hon. Number-one son
back on the straight and narrow.

15
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,683
Me? Fine. Just needed
a little field trip to clear the head.

16
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:26,242
Bit of a nightmare day.

17
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,620
I'll see you in a bit.
You bet.

18
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,626
I love you, Liz.

19
00:04:05,353 --> 00:04:08,220
This is a very dynamic game,
Mr. Dapina.

20
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,554
You can be honest, Angela.
This game is as bloody as it gets.

21
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,992
Believe me,
the kids will eat this up.

22
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:16,621
First, tell me what keeps crashing
the damn thing.

23
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:24,861
You have been virused, Mr. Dapina,
and a not so very nice one.

24
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:27,339
You're the best.
I knew I could count on you.

25
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:29,000
What should we do?

26
00:04:29,076 --> 00:04:32,011
Don't hit the escape key
on any of your systems for a while.

27
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,013
One keystroke will wipe out
your whole system.

28
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:37,448
I don't know how these things happen.
I just ordered that security program.

29
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:40,043
What's it called?
Gatekeeper?

30
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,646
That's what they all say.
Did you install it?

31
00:04:42,723 --> 00:04:45,954
Absolutely.
The minute we got it, I think.

32
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,621
Everything's under control.
It's gonna be okay.

33
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:52,894
You're the best. Will we be able
to get this in stores by week's end?

34
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:55,231
Absolutely.
Everything but the virus.

35
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:58,795
A friend of mine collects them.
I don't know, some people save string.

36
00:04:58,873 --> 00:05:02,365
You are a genius, Angela.
I can't thank you enough.

37
00:05:02,443 --> 00:05:05,173
You might think differently
once you get my bill from Cathedral.

38
00:05:05,246 --> 00:05:09,080
Whatever it is, it's worth it.
I'd love to show you my appreciation.

39
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,516
Take you out to dinner tonight,
some drinks.

40
00:05:11,586 --> 00:05:13,611
Get you out of the house.

41
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,213
Oh, I'm very flattered
and appreciative, but I...

42
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,281
You gotta eat.

43
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,658
Unfortunately, I already
have dinner plans, so...

44
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:24,926
How about tomorrow?
The next day?

45
00:05:24,999 --> 00:05:28,457
These plans are kind of
a standing arrangement.

46
00:05:28,536 --> 00:05:31,528
But I appreciate it.
Thank you.

47
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:33,904
- You're still the best.
- I'll speak to you soon. Bye-Bye.

48
00:05:47,188 --> 00:05:48,416
Large.

49
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:51,583
Garlic?

50
00:05:54,462 --> 00:05:56,259
Thank you.

51
00:06:43,177 --> 00:06:45,771
No one leaves the house anymore.

52
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:48,110
No one has sex.

53
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:50,912
The net is ultimate condom.

54
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,250
Come on.
Talk like that, Iceman...

55
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:59,088
could lead to the eventual
extinction of our species.

56
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:03,096
My sympathies exactly, Angel.

57
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,291
Let's have a date and procreate.

58
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:08,961
Not me. In two days,
I'm off on vacation.

59
00:07:09,036 --> 00:07:14,338
Just me, the beach and a book.

60
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,445
I'm there, babe.
Look no further.

61
00:07:19,513 --> 00:07:22,073
Sorry. Not my type.

62
00:07:23,417 --> 00:07:27,183
I'm crushed.
So what do you want in a man?

63
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:32,949
Butch.

64
00:07:33,027 --> 00:07:34,585
Beautiful.

65
00:07:37,865 --> 00:07:39,355
Brilliant.

66
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,560
Captain America...

67
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:48,131
meets Albert Schweitzer.

68
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:53,413
Spends all day dashing into fray...

69
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:57,247
while making world...

70
00:07:57,318 --> 00:08:00,549
safe for democracy.

71
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:05,991
At night, playing Bach cantatas...

72
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,394
while curing cancer.

73
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:14,127
Settle for a guy
who puts the seat down?

74
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,031
Listen, Angel, you're dreaming.

75
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:21,040
- You're one of us.
- We accept you.

76
00:08:21,108 --> 00:08:23,303
We accept her.
You're one of us.

77
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,571
One of us.

78
00:08:26,213 --> 00:08:28,909
Yeah, I know.

79
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:04,283
It's beautiful.

80
00:09:04,351 --> 00:09:07,548
- I love Chopin.
- You know this piece?

81
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,454
Well, I should.
You taught it to me.

82
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,789
Brought you something.

83
00:09:18,866 --> 00:09:21,994
Just don't let the nurses
eat it all this time.

84
00:09:22,069 --> 00:09:25,402
My favorite.
How did you know?

85
00:09:31,245 --> 00:09:34,373
Do you wanna...
We could play it together.

86
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,911
I'm going on vacation
for about a week to the Yucatan.

87
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,383
If for any reason
you need to get in touch with me...

88
00:10:11,452 --> 00:10:15,388
I don't know if they have phones there,
but you can talk to one of the nurses...

89
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:17,583
You must be one of my students.

90
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,354
No, Mom.
My name's Angela.

91
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,396
Can you bring me some candy
when you come again?

92
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:34,941
- My favorites are those...
- Almond Roca.

93
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,443
Yeah, I know
what your favorites are.

94
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,218
- Angela Bennett!
- Who is it?

95
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:54,625
- FedEx.
- Coming.

96
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,654
Thank you for using our reservation
service. Have a pleasant flight.

97
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,874
Line five, please.

98
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:13,638
- Oh, I have another one going out.
- Okay. Here you go, ma'am.

99
00:11:18,586 --> 00:11:21,077
And here's your virus, Dale.

100
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:29,185
- Can I use your pen?
- Yeah, sure.

101
00:11:29,263 --> 00:11:30,730
This is a nice place.

102
00:11:32,533 --> 00:11:34,660
Thanks.

103
00:11:39,807 --> 00:11:42,799
- Have a nice day, ma'am.
- You too.

104
00:12:10,404 --> 00:12:13,703
Mozart's Ghost!
The hottest band on the Internet.

105
00:12:22,683 --> 00:12:25,083
- Cathedral Software.
- Dale Hessman, please.

106
00:12:25,152 --> 00:12:26,414
Please hold.

107
00:12:27,488 --> 00:12:29,683
- Hello.
- Hi, it's Angela.

108
00:12:29,757 --> 00:12:33,989
Angela? FedEx had you signing
for that disk three minutes ago.

109
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:36,461
- What took you so long?
- I was having way too much fun...

110
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,930
with this Mozart's Ghost.

111
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,436
By the way, I sent you a whopper
of a virus for your hall of fame.

112
00:12:43,504 --> 00:12:45,995
Just be a little careful
with the escape button.

113
00:12:46,073 --> 00:12:50,567
Look, here's the problem.
Pop yourself into concert information.

114
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:51,975
All right.

115
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:57,844
Houston Utilities. Dale, I think
you took a wrong turn here.

116
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:01,479
Not quite Ticketmaster, is it?
See anything unusual?

117
00:13:02,856 --> 00:13:05,984
No, looks like a normal web page to me,
except for that...

118
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,255
little icon at the bottom
of the screen.

119
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,763
Click on it, and then
press control-shift.

120
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,198
- My God.
- So, what do you make of all this?

121
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,505
Simple.
It's a programming glitch.

122
00:13:23,577 --> 00:13:26,637
It's a futzed keystroke that sent you
the wrong Internet address.

123
00:13:26,714 --> 00:13:30,775
Last night it sent me to Amtrak's
central mainframe and the Mayo Clinic.

124
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,842
Neither of them
are on the same subnet.

125
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,821
Angela, I've accessed
a system I shouldn't have.

126
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,188
If someone gets ahold of that disk,
they'd have an awful lot of power.

127
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:41,989
Why don't you just crawl in there,
find the program error and delete it?

128
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:44,530
Not quite ready to do that yet.

129
00:13:44,598 --> 00:13:47,795
Look, what's your day like tomorrow?

130
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,961
Oh, no. No.

131
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,131
I'm going on my first vacation
in six years.

132
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,233
I just confirmed my reservation.
There are no refunds.

133
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,871
- What time is your flight?
- 12:00. But I have to pack.

134
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,472
I'm gonna be a complete madwoman.

135
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:05,848
- Why don't you wait till I get back?
- I don't think so.

136
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,411
- Just tell me what this is about.
- I'd rather not on the phone.

137
00:14:10,457 --> 00:14:13,483
I can fly down tonight in my Cessna,
be there by breakfast.

138
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,824
We'd have five hours.

139
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:18,126
You know this shit
better than anyone.

140
00:14:20,834 --> 00:14:23,860
Fine. Fine.
I'll see you at 7:00.

141
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,238
Great. So,
they finally get to meet.

142
00:14:28,308 --> 00:14:30,469
I'll be the tall guy.

143
00:14:30,544 --> 00:14:35,345
I'm gonna be the one with "Spineless
Simp" tattooed to her forehead.

144
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,112
Bye. See you tomorrow.

145
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,984
Why do I do this?

146
00:14:44,825 --> 00:14:49,228
Burbank Tower.
Cessna 739 Mike Bravo.

147
00:14:49,296 --> 00:14:53,392
Intercepting approach course
I. L. S., runway eight.

148
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:58,604
Three-nine Mike Bravo,
we've lost radar contact.

149
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,765
Say your position and altitude.

150
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:04,641
Just passing the middle marker
at 1,300 feet.

151
00:15:04,711 --> 00:15:07,612
Three-nine Mike Bravo,
that's a negative.

152
00:15:07,681 --> 00:15:10,081
Verify your position
and check your instruments.

153
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,176
All normal, for crying out loud.
You must be able to see my lights.

154
00:15:13,253 --> 00:15:17,155
That's a negative.
Execute a missed approach immediately.

155
00:15:17,224 --> 00:15:19,658
Contact approach control on 124.5.

156
00:15:19,726 --> 00:15:22,786
Okay, Burbank, but still
everything looks ok...

157
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:24,421
Shit!

158
00:15:24,498 --> 00:15:26,489
God!

159
00:16:13,947 --> 00:16:16,313
- Cathedral Software.
- Hi. Russ Melbourne, please.

160
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,183
- One moment, please.
- Mozart's Ghost!

161
00:16:20,254 --> 00:16:22,188
- Russ Melbourne here.
- Hi. It's Angela.

162
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:24,315
I thought you'd be long gone.

163
00:16:24,391 --> 00:16:26,552
No, I was getting ready to leave.
That's why I'm calling.

164
00:16:26,627 --> 00:16:29,892
I'm glad you're still going,
but when you get back, we need to talk.

165
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:33,330
We're really desperately short
of your genius up here.

166
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,766
Oh, please. I'm far
from being a genius, Russ...

167
00:16:35,836 --> 00:16:38,771
especially with a room full of people
looking over my shoulder.

168
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,569
- That's not the reason I called.
- Just think about it, will ya?

169
00:16:41,642 --> 00:16:44,509
The honchos up here aren't
gonna let me replace Dale...

170
00:16:44,578 --> 00:16:48,708
on such short notice, not with all the
security breaches we've had in the past.

171
00:16:48,782 --> 00:16:51,945
Replace Dale. Okay.
What? You're kidding, right?

172
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,681
Oh, God, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd heard.

173
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,556
What? What happened?

174
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:02,521
Angela, Dale's dead. His plane
crashed last night outside L. A.

175
00:17:02,596 --> 00:17:07,056
I just talked to him yesterday.
He was coming to see me.

176
00:17:07,134 --> 00:17:09,694
Kind of puts things
in perspective, doesn't it?

177
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:13,464
Let's talk when you get back, huh?

178
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,032
And try to have a good vacation.

179
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:20,307
Okay. I'll talk to you soon, Russ.

180
00:17:43,303 --> 00:17:47,535
Plenty of time. Ain't nothin' comin' in
or goin' out for the last hour.

181
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:52,807
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention, please.

182
00:17:52,879 --> 00:17:54,813
We are sorry to announce...

183
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:58,180
there is a computer malfunction,
and all flights have been temporarily...

184
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:01,118
- The whole airport is down.
- When we get further information...

185
00:18:01,188 --> 00:18:02,712
we will advise you.

186
00:18:02,789 --> 00:18:04,757
Thank you very much.

187
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,666
- We will let you all know.
- Excuse me.

188
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:19,865
I understand.
We're doing the best we can.

189
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,636
A blood test taken last week...

190
00:18:26,713 --> 00:18:29,546
at Bethesda Naval Hospital
did in fact reveal...

191
00:18:29,616 --> 00:18:32,710
that Undersecretary of Defense
Mike Bergstrom...

192
00:18:32,786 --> 00:18:35,152
was infected with the AIDS virus.

193
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:37,782
You okay?

194
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:41,123
Yeah. It's all these people.

195
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:44,960
No, I meant are you okay with your soda?
Would you like a refill?

196
00:18:45,032 --> 00:18:47,865
- No, I'm fine. I've had three.
- The malfunction has been repaired.

197
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,801
One more, and I'll be able
to fly myself to Mexico.

198
00:18:50,871 --> 00:18:54,136
Looks like you won't have to.
Enjoy your flight.

199
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:44,189
- Mozart's Ghost!
- Waiter, I'd like a gibson, please.

200
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:48,250
It's a martini with an onion
instead of an olive.

201
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:51,889
Is that okay?
Thanks.

202
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:56,700
Excuse me.
Could I have one too, please?

203
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,000
I'll take mine up at the bar.

204
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,370
Didn't think anybody else
drank those anymore?

205
00:20:04,444 --> 00:20:09,108
I guess I'm not as unfashionable
as I once thought I was.

206
00:20:13,954 --> 00:20:16,388
Is that business or pleasure?

207
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:18,788
Is there a difference?

208
00:20:18,859 --> 00:20:21,453
Not a great deal
if you're a hacker.

209
00:20:25,165 --> 00:20:28,896
That's a nice piece of hardware.
I assume you're in the business.

210
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:31,494
Isn't everybody?

211
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:33,402
Nope.

212
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,476
God, we're pathetic, aren't we?

213
00:20:41,181 --> 00:20:43,649
Excuse me?

214
00:20:44,551 --> 00:20:46,314
Well, we're here.

215
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:50,815
We're sitting on the most
perfect beach in the world...

216
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,724
and all we can think about
is where...

217
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:56,729
Where can I hook up my modem?

218
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,731
Yeah, exactly.

219
00:21:04,404 --> 00:21:07,168
Um, I'm Jack Devlin.

220
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:13,669
- Angela Bennett.
- Angela?

221
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:25,250
My most embarrassing secret.

222
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,494
You know Breakfast At Tiffany's?

223
00:21:28,562 --> 00:21:31,588
- Very well. It's my favorite film.
- Right.

224
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,895
I wore out my membership renting it.

225
00:21:33,967 --> 00:21:36,959
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Yes. Very much so.

226
00:21:37,037 --> 00:21:38,800
When I was about 13...

227
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,504
I had this sort of
identity crisis.

228
00:21:45,745 --> 00:21:48,475
I used to think
I was one of the characters.

229
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:50,675
You thought
you were Audrey Hepburn?

230
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:55,352
- No, I used to think I was the cat.
- The cat?

231
00:21:55,422 --> 00:21:57,583
I'd sit there...

232
00:21:57,657 --> 00:22:01,218
and I'd play out
the last scene of the movie.

233
00:22:01,294 --> 00:22:04,627
I'd just play it
over and over again.

234
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,498
- You know the last scene?
- Yes, I know the last scene.

235
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,969
Out in the pouring rain,
out in the alleyway.

236
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:14,666
I'm soaked to the bone,
and I'm scared.

237
00:22:16,443 --> 00:22:18,411
And I'm...

238
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,777
abandoned.

239
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:24,817
I'm alone.

240
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,212
That's it.

241
00:22:34,828 --> 00:22:37,888
Moon River

242
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:40,558
Wider than a mile

243
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:50,042
Would you have dinner
with me tonight?

244
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:55,781
Come on.
It's your last night.

245
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:57,282
You know what?

246
00:22:58,852 --> 00:23:01,787
I would... I would actually
really love to.

247
00:23:01,855 --> 00:23:03,789
Great.

248
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:09,719
- It's a company perk.
- God, this is a company perk?

249
00:23:09,796 --> 00:23:11,764
- Yeah.
- Some perk.

250
00:23:11,831 --> 00:23:14,732
I think I got a calendar
one year from Cathedral.

251
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,441
Where are you from?
Colorado?

252
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:35,613
Yes, it has to be.
The eastern...

253
00:23:35,689 --> 00:23:39,455
Maybe it's the southeastern part
of the state.

254
00:23:39,526 --> 00:23:42,689
The teeming metropolis
of La Junta, population 50.

255
00:23:42,762 --> 00:23:46,095
- La Junta?
- That's pretty good.

256
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:49,294
Is my accent that strong
after all these years?

257
00:23:49,369 --> 00:23:52,566
- No, it's just a trick I do.
- Oh.

258
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,371
Why "after all these years"?
How long have you been gone?

259
00:23:57,444 --> 00:24:00,743
Oh, boy.
It seems like a lifetime.

260
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,078
Let's see. I was, uh...

261
00:24:03,149 --> 00:24:05,982
I was 15 going on 10...

262
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:10,853
and we moved from La Junta
to San Jose...

263
00:24:10,924 --> 00:24:12,858
Tulsa, um...

264
00:24:12,926 --> 00:24:14,860
So your father
got transferred a lot?

265
00:24:14,928 --> 00:24:18,694
No, not really. No. He, um...

266
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:23,532
I don't know. He just, you know...
He just transferred out one day.

267
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,869
What? What are you looking at?

268
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:35,145
You.

269
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:38,146
Me?

270
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:44,546
Computers are your life,
aren't they?

271
00:24:45,492 --> 00:24:48,154
Yes. Perfect hiding place.

272
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,863
Thanks.

273
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,460
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Nice one of you.

274
00:24:58,772 --> 00:25:01,332
I have one or two other interests,
I'll have you know.

275
00:25:01,408 --> 00:25:05,367
Such as? What's your speciality
in computers?

276
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:07,572
Oh, anything, pretty much.

277
00:25:07,647 --> 00:25:10,241
Beta testing, mostly,
but pretty much anything.

278
00:25:11,785 --> 00:25:14,310
- That's way over my head, I'm afraid.
- No, no.

279
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:19,086
You just go into people's systems,
you find the faults and you fix it.

280
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:21,821
What happens if they don't
have any faults?

281
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,659
Don't believe I've met one yet.

282
00:25:28,134 --> 00:25:30,068
You must be a bit cold.

283
00:25:30,136 --> 00:25:33,003
Not really.
Well, yeah, a little bit.

284
00:25:37,477 --> 00:25:40,105
- Here.
- What?

285
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,205
It goes around here.

286
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,354
Better?

287
00:26:02,902 --> 00:26:06,633
- Want one?
- Oh, God, I used to smoke those.

288
00:26:06,706 --> 00:26:08,901
But you quit, right?

289
00:26:11,644 --> 00:26:13,578
Well, I refuse to.

290
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:18,675
I reckon you gotta try a few things
in life without a safety net...

291
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,015
or how else you gonna know
you're alive?

292
00:26:21,087 --> 00:26:23,749
Well, I take my share of risks.

293
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,758
I don't always floss.

294
00:26:26,826 --> 00:26:30,023
I rip the tags off my pillows
when they're new.

295
00:26:32,665 --> 00:26:35,031
- My kind of woman.
- Yeah, well...

296
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,937
Pretty adventurous?

297
00:26:39,005 --> 00:26:42,736
I don't know.
What did you have in mind?

298
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,868
Dare you risk it?

299
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,670
Shit! My purse!

300
00:26:48,748 --> 00:26:50,682
- Fuck!
- No! Don't!

301
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,809
- It's not worth getting killed over!
- Come back!

302
00:26:52,886 --> 00:26:54,945
- Jack, come back here!
- You! Stop!

303
00:27:01,928 --> 00:27:03,987
- It's not here.
- It's not in hotel.

304
00:27:04,063 --> 00:27:05,690
I look everywhere.

305
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:08,598
So I come here. I do like you say.
Whoosh, like magician.

306
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,899
Oh, yeah.
You're the midget Houdini.

307
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:13,734
Okay. Now the dinero.

308
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:03,451
God, I had everything in that bag.
I had my passport, my credit cards.

309
00:28:03,523 --> 00:28:05,684
- Ow.
- Sorry.

310
00:28:05,758 --> 00:28:07,783
Thanks for doing this.

311
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,454
Well, you're the one
bleeding to death.

312
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:14,591
I am the one crying
about my MasterCard.

313
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:17,295
I apologize
for having been a jerk.

314
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:21,170
What do you mean?
I'm the jerk.

315
00:28:22,675 --> 00:28:24,609
Only trying to impress you.

316
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:28,611
Well, for future reference...

317
00:28:28,681 --> 00:28:32,412
you should know that the living tend
to interest me more than the dead do.

318
00:28:32,485 --> 00:28:34,976
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:35,054 --> 00:28:37,420
I suppose that's quite healthy.

320
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:49,631
I suppose we ought to call up
the Cancun police on the ship-to-shore.

321
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:57,738
It's not working.
We'll have to head further out.

322
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:02,747
You can head to Morocco for all I care.
It's beautiful out here.

323
00:29:19,098 --> 00:29:20,463
How we doing?

324
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,765
Still no dice.

325
00:29:45,258 --> 00:29:50,161
I'm just going down below.
I won't be a minute.

326
00:30:17,557 --> 00:30:19,787
Maybe we didn't go out far enough.

327
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,054
No, this should do it.

328
00:30:28,634 --> 00:30:32,035
Tonight's been
so out of control, huh?

329
00:30:32,105 --> 00:30:33,538
Yeah.

330
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,734
I hope you don't
take this the wrong way...

331
00:31:04,804 --> 00:31:07,500
but this isn't exactly my style.

332
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,604
I thought you liked taking risks.

333
00:31:13,379 --> 00:31:17,213
Well, yes, but I mean...

334
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:20,218
- You know what I mean.
- What?

335
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:22,481
- You know, first date.
- Yeah.

336
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:24,819
- Sex, one-night stand.
- Oh, sex.

337
00:31:24,891 --> 00:31:27,223
Yes, that sort of thing.

338
00:31:27,293 --> 00:31:30,126
You've always been
a relationship kind of girl.

339
00:31:30,196 --> 00:31:32,596
Absolutely.
Both times.

340
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,464
So when was the last time?

341
00:31:38,538 --> 00:31:41,473
Um, 1933.

342
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:43,031
Oh, I see.

343
00:31:45,578 --> 00:31:48,206
And who was he?
Your college boyfriend?

344
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,078
Yeah, I bet he was the...

345
00:31:54,153 --> 00:31:57,122
He was the captain
of the drinking team.

346
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,816
Wasn't ready for a relationship.

347
00:32:00,893 --> 00:32:03,953
Oh, I wish I had been that lucky.

348
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,999
No, it was my shrink, actually.

349
00:32:09,001 --> 00:32:10,901
You know the story.

350
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:15,236
I thought I was lonely,
and he forgot he was married.

351
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,668
That's okay.
It didn't last very long.

352
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:25,173
My mom developed Alzheimer's
around then, so it was really...

353
00:32:28,187 --> 00:32:30,655
You know what?
I'm gonna shut up right now.

354
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:34,352
- I'm just gonna be quiet.
- It's okay.

355
00:32:34,427 --> 00:32:38,420
No, actually, it's me
who doesn't want to hear it.

356
00:32:40,066 --> 00:32:45,299
Sorry. I'm rambling a little bit
because I'm a little nervous.

357
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,837
You want a drink?

358
00:32:51,911 --> 00:32:54,846
Yes. That'd be greatly appreciated.
Thank you.

359
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,661
So, what's this for?

360
00:33:46,666 --> 00:33:49,965
It's, uh...
It's for shark fishing.

361
00:33:50,036 --> 00:33:53,836
Shark fishing?
With a silencer?

362
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,101
Yeah.

363
00:33:59,512 --> 00:34:01,412
You certainly
seem to know your ordnance.

364
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,074
Colorado.
You grow up with guns.

365
00:34:05,685 --> 00:34:07,243
Yeah.

366
00:34:08,187 --> 00:34:11,953
So, who are you, Jack?

367
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:15,690
Who am I?

368
00:34:15,761 --> 00:34:18,161
I'll tell you who I am.

369
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:21,256
I'm Captain Goddamn America
meets Albert Schweitzer.

370
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:24,132
That's who I am.
Isn't that what you always wanted?

371
00:34:24,203 --> 00:34:25,864
It is. I remember.

372
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,406
It was butch...

373
00:34:28,474 --> 00:34:29,771
beautiful...

374
00:34:29,842 --> 00:34:31,434
brilliant,
spends all day...

375
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,704
dashing into the fray...

376
00:34:32,778 --> 00:34:35,246
fists flying.

377
00:34:35,314 --> 00:34:38,909
Sorry, I don't know
any organ cantatas.

378
00:34:38,985 --> 00:34:40,282
Was that it?

379
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,779
And if you'll excuse me...

380
00:34:45,725 --> 00:34:48,216
it's time to make the world
safe for democracy.

381
00:34:59,238 --> 00:35:01,069
Where's the clip?

382
00:35:02,341 --> 00:35:04,571
Give me that!

383
00:35:08,514 --> 00:35:09,446
Bitch.

384
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:17,185
Somebody, I need help.

385
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:18,780
Somebody? Hello?

386
00:35:18,858 --> 00:35:20,758
Please, somebody,
I need help.

387
00:35:24,897 --> 00:35:26,421
Keys. Okay.

388
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,307
What? No.
How did I get here?

389
00:37:18,844 --> 00:37:20,402
How'd I get here?

390
00:37:20,479 --> 00:37:23,107
A fisherman found you.
He brought you here.

391
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,084
You were very lucky
they came by.

392
00:37:26,152 --> 00:37:28,086
How long have I been here?

393
00:37:28,154 --> 00:37:30,213
Three days.
Try not to talk too much.

394
00:37:31,524 --> 00:37:33,458
Oh, we found a man's wallet...

395
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,926
filled with pesos
and a lot of U. S. dollars.

396
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:38,725
- We tried to contact him...
- No. He...

397
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,892
No. There was no luck
finding this man.

398
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:44,959
There was a disk.

399
00:37:45,037 --> 00:37:48,234
Green square, plastic disk.

400
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:49,774
Ah, yes.

401
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,870
The disk was ruined by the sun.

402
00:37:53,946 --> 00:37:56,642
You relax now, hmm?
Get well.

403
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,376
- No. I need...
- In a few days.

404
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:03,114
Look at you now.
You haven't got the strength. Please.

405
00:38:03,189 --> 00:38:05,453
My clothes.
How much do I owe you?

406
00:38:05,524 --> 00:38:08,425
Please. You have to relax now.
You have to rest.

407
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:10,792
- You need a few days.
- I need my clothes.

408
00:38:10,863 --> 00:38:12,956
I have to go.
I just need my clothes.

409
00:38:22,775 --> 00:38:26,973
In national news, we go
to WNN correspondent Daniel Schorr.

410
00:38:27,046 --> 00:38:30,015
- Hi. I need...
- Wall Street panicked when prices...

411
00:38:30,082 --> 00:38:33,574
appeared to tumble at a rate
reminiscent of the Black Tuesday crash.

412
00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:36,177
Officials suspended trading
when it became clear...

413
00:38:36,255 --> 00:38:39,986
that the losses were fictitious
and caused by computer pranksters.

414
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:43,790
- I need my room key for 2806, please.
- What is the name?

415
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,388
-Angela Bennett.
-Wall Street expects to open tomorrow...

416
00:38:46,465 --> 00:38:51,402
with its computers protected by Gregg
Microsystems' latest security program...

417
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,166
aptly nicknamed the Gatekeeper.

418
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,174
What about that prank downtown?

419
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:59,973
Pranks? Short-sheeting
someone's bed is a prank.

420
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:03,412
These Praetorians could've done
serious damage to our economy...

421
00:39:03,482 --> 00:39:05,677
just as the actions
recently at LAX.

422
00:39:05,751 --> 00:39:09,346
No, I'm sorry. Angela Bennett
checked out last Saturday night.

423
00:39:09,421 --> 00:39:12,356
No. Sorry, you don't understand.
I'm Angela Bennett.

424
00:39:12,424 --> 00:39:14,449
I'm standing right here.
I didn't check out.

425
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:17,689
It's not on the computer here.
Let me check one more thing.

426
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,234
No Angela Bennett.
She checked out last Saturday night.

427
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:27,734
No, I didn't check out.
I would know if I checked out.

428
00:39:27,806 --> 00:39:30,639
- I didn't check out.
- According to the computer, you did.

429
00:39:30,709 --> 00:39:33,303
There's nothing I can do for you.
Okay? I'm sorry.

430
00:39:33,379 --> 00:39:36,348
- Excuse me, sir?
- Step here, sir, please.

431
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,145
That room is fine.
We'll take it.

432
00:39:39,218 --> 00:39:43,245
That's for you. Okay.
This one. Excuse me, ma'am.

433
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,723
- There you go.
- Thank you.

434
00:39:48,794 --> 00:39:51,786
Please dial
your card number again now.

435
00:39:51,864 --> 00:39:54,924
The card number you have just dialed
is not valid.

436
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,361
Miss Marx?

437
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:02,229
Please dial
your card number again now.

438
00:40:02,308 --> 00:40:04,708
- Ruth Marx? Excuse me.
- The card number you have just dialed...

439
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:07,268
- Are you Ruth Marx?
- No.

440
00:40:08,814 --> 00:40:11,647
You're not the woman who was here
about a temporary visa?

441
00:40:11,717 --> 00:40:13,651
No, I am here about a visa, but...

442
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,782
Is your Social Security number
915-30-1717?

443
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:23,260
You live at 407 Finley Avenue,
Venice, California?

444
00:40:24,096 --> 00:40:25,154
Yeah.

445
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,164
Well, then according
to the computers...

446
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:29,462
of the California Department
of Motor Vehicles...

447
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:31,662
you're Ruth Marx.

448
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:34,836
So if that's who you are...

449
00:40:34,907 --> 00:40:37,876
you need to sign your name there,
and we'll issue your visa.

450
00:40:37,943 --> 00:40:41,504
- But I'm not...
- You're not what?

451
00:40:45,317 --> 00:40:48,081
I'm not clear about something.

452
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:52,783
Without this, I can't get back
into the United States. Is that correct?

453
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:54,223
That's correct.

454
00:40:54,293 --> 00:40:58,923
So all I would have to do
is just sign Ruth Marx and...

455
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,465
Right there.

456
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,651
Okay. Think, think.

457
00:42:35,861 --> 00:42:37,385
Oh, my God.

458
00:42:39,531 --> 00:42:40,896
Oh, my God.

459
00:42:44,236 --> 00:42:47,228
Where're you runnin'?
Don't run. Take your time. Relax.

460
00:42:47,306 --> 00:42:50,833
My name is Stan Whiteman,
Whiteman Realty. Let me show you around.

461
00:42:50,909 --> 00:42:52,342
You'll like it.

462
00:42:52,411 --> 00:42:54,902
Oh, I definitely saw her move out.

463
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:56,971
Okay, when was this?

464
00:42:57,049 --> 00:43:00,041
Three days ago. Moving van,
moving men, furniture.

465
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,488
I've been in Mexico for over a week.
How could I be in L. A. selling my house?

466
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:08,322
It wasn't your house to sell!
It's not her! It's not Angela Bennett!

467
00:43:08,393 --> 00:43:10,827
- Calm down.
- I am Angela Bennett!

468
00:43:10,896 --> 00:43:13,592
The real Angela Bennett
had the deed and the mortgage papers!

469
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:17,294
I got 20,000 in computers.
I checked every record. It's not her!

470
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:22,272
Ma'am, it would help if you could
produce some form of identification.

471
00:43:22,341 --> 00:43:24,275
You know what?
I agree with you.

472
00:43:24,343 --> 00:43:26,607
But as I have told you
1,000 times today...

473
00:43:26,678 --> 00:43:28,612
I had everything stolen in Cozumel.

474
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,911
Please. Ask her how she got
across the border without a passport.

475
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,316
- I had a temporary issued.
- Do they do that?

476
00:43:34,386 --> 00:43:39,153
- I don't think they do that.
- Oh, my God. This is ridiculous.

477
00:43:39,224 --> 00:43:41,556
Here. Here it is.
This is it.

478
00:43:41,627 --> 00:43:44,221
It's just that
it's under a different name.

479
00:43:44,296 --> 00:43:47,459
- Why's that?
- Because they think I'm not me.

480
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:49,763
- Is this your signature?
- Well, no.

481
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:53,896
It's my handwriting, but I just signed
a different name that they gave me.

482
00:43:53,972 --> 00:43:55,940
It's a federal offense
to forge a visa.

483
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,068
Oh, really? It is?
And what is it to steal an entire house?

484
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:02,602
- Yo, Mike. You wanna run this?
- I'll be right back.

485
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,774
It's not gonna make any difference,
because what they've done is...

486
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:07,580
they've screwed with my information
and my fingerprints.

487
00:44:07,653 --> 00:44:10,816
- Who's they?
- I have no idea.

488
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:14,120
Where do you work?
Do you work around here?

489
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,822
Yeah, I work in my house,
but my office is in San Francisco.

490
00:44:17,896 --> 00:44:21,024
But I've never been there.
I work out of my house.

491
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:24,830
You don't know one person in a town
you've lived in for four years...

492
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:27,929
who can vouch you're Angela Bennett...
not a mother, a father?

493
00:44:28,006 --> 00:44:31,339
My mother is not well.
My father is...

494
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,742
No.

495
00:44:33,812 --> 00:44:38,681
There's, uh...
There's my therapist Alan Champion.

496
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,548
- Your therapist?
- My ex-therapist, all right?

497
00:44:53,932 --> 00:44:56,901
Yeah, we've got a Ruth Marx
trying to run a scam at a house.

498
00:44:56,969 --> 00:45:00,166
She's wanted for prostitution
and narcotics.

499
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,072
We're gonna bring her in.

500
00:45:03,141 --> 00:45:05,837
Um, would you excuse me?

501
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:09,779
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm just gonna use...

502
00:45:13,218 --> 00:45:15,686
Mrs. Raines...

503
00:45:16,488 --> 00:45:18,956
is she or isn't she?

504
00:45:19,024 --> 00:45:21,424
She kept to herself,
didn't talk to anybody.

505
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,729
- Where's the girl?
- She's...

506
00:45:24,796 --> 00:45:27,128
Where's my phone?
Anybody seen my phone?

507
00:45:44,049 --> 00:45:47,041
Excuse me, sir. Did you see
a young woman running out of here?

508
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,145
- No, sir. I haven't seen anyone.
- Thanks.

509
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,274
- Yeah?
- What the hell happened, Devlin?

510
00:46:16,348 --> 00:46:20,444
Don't worry. We'll get hold of the disk.
We'll find who she's been speaking to.

511
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,716
She's out here on her own.
She's feeling pretty vulnerable.

512
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:27,589
We don't want another Cozumel, Devlin.
She's your responsibility. Deal with it.

513
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,423
I said I'd take care of her,
all right?

514
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,207
- Cathedral Software.
- Russ Melbourne.

515
00:46:42,242 --> 00:46:43,174
- Cathedral Software.
- Russ Melbourne.

516
00:46:43,241 --> 00:46:46,074
Mr. Melbourne is no longer
with the company.

517
00:46:46,144 --> 00:46:47,702
What do you mean?

518
00:46:47,779 --> 00:46:50,805
May I connect you
to someone who could help you?

519
00:46:50,882 --> 00:46:52,941
I've never dealt with anybody
in operations.

520
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,579
- I don't know anybody else.
- Who may I connect you with?

521
00:46:56,655 --> 00:46:59,681
Head of Security Systems.
Tell them that it's Angela Bennett.

522
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:01,988
Thank you. I'll put you through
to Miss Bennett.

523
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,325
What? No.
I am Angela Bennett.

524
00:47:07,799 --> 00:47:09,699
This is Angela Bennett.

525
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:19,840
- Who is this?
- This is Angela Bennett. Hello?

526
00:47:25,117 --> 00:47:28,678
This is someone that can help you.
Give us the disk, Angela.

527
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:32,554
You have the wrong person.
I don't know what you're talking about.

528
00:47:32,624 --> 00:47:35,559
Just give us the disk,
and we'll give you your life back.

529
00:47:35,627 --> 00:47:40,087
I don't understand. I don't have
your disk. I don't know what you mean.

530
00:47:40,165 --> 00:47:42,599
Give us the disk, Angela.

531
00:47:54,479 --> 00:47:57,312
- What's the number?
- 555-7605.

532
00:47:57,382 --> 00:48:00,545
- Did you get the address?
- It's 3100 California.

533
00:48:09,661 --> 00:48:11,959
Hi. This is Dr. Alan Champion.
I can't come to the phone right now.

534
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:14,794
- Please be home.
- Please leave your name, your number.

535
00:48:14,866 --> 00:48:16,800
You know the drill.

536
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,170
Are you screening?
Please be screening.

537
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,436
- Hello? Hello. I'm home.
- Hi. It's me.

538
00:48:26,478 --> 00:48:29,072
I need your help.
I'm in a lot of trouble.

539
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:33,777
- Shit.
- I'm not sure what you want me to do.

540
00:48:33,852 --> 00:48:37,015
Hold on.
This is a cell phone, right?

541
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,613
Yeah, so we can't put
a normal trace on it.

542
00:48:39,691 --> 00:48:42,421
Listen. There's no problem. No.

543
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:44,428
- Just get the number.
- Right.

544
00:48:44,496 --> 00:48:47,021
But don't dial it.
Just send out a signal.

545
00:48:47,098 --> 00:48:49,032
- Send it from the base?
- Yeah.

546
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:52,365
Then find me two repeater cells
that can pick it up.

547
00:48:52,437 --> 00:48:55,964
Give me the bisect, and it'll find it
within a few hundred yards.

548
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:57,975
- Okay.
- Go.

549
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,932
- Go, go.
- Nice to see you too.

550
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,476
- I'm sorry. Just go.
- Come on. I'm not a cab.

551
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:34,978
- Say hi.
- Hi. Can we go now?

552
00:49:35,046 --> 00:49:37,378
Yeah, now we can go.

553
00:49:37,449 --> 00:49:40,680
Listen, do you still have
that laptop that I gave you?

554
00:49:40,752 --> 00:49:42,982
- Uh-huh. I'm wearing it.
- I'm serious. Do you have it?

555
00:49:43,054 --> 00:49:46,956
- Yes, I have it.
- We need to get it and go to a hotel.

556
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,550
- Now that's doable.
- Alan, just go.

557
00:49:49,628 --> 00:49:52,791
Just go, go, go.

558
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:56,300
I swear to God. I asked for a quarter,
and she gave me a telephone.

559
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:59,030
Yeah, that's right.
I'm calling everybody.

560
00:49:59,104 --> 00:50:00,696
Clever girl.

561
00:50:02,607 --> 00:50:04,768
Voila. Ouch.

562
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:11,380
Alan, you don't have to stay
if you don't want to.

563
00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:14,213
I'm sure that...
God, what's her name?

564
00:50:14,286 --> 00:50:17,585
Amy. Don't worry.
It's over with Amy.

565
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,926
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be, dearie.

566
00:50:23,995 --> 00:50:26,520
We're not.
This is bizarre.

567
00:50:26,598 --> 00:50:29,260
I haven't seen you in so long.
What are we even doing here?

568
00:50:29,334 --> 00:50:31,564
I just figured you would be safe.

569
00:50:31,636 --> 00:50:35,629
Oh, great. So I've gone from being
a self-centered asshole to safe.

570
00:50:35,707 --> 00:50:38,369
Thank you very much.

571
00:50:38,443 --> 00:50:42,641
No, I just figured that they couldn't
trace me to you and that your...

572
00:50:43,715 --> 00:50:45,774
Your patient records
are confidential, right?

573
00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:49,479
My patient records.
Yeah, I knew I had my subtle charms.

574
00:50:49,554 --> 00:50:52,648
It's just you're the only person
I have to turn to right now.

575
00:50:52,724 --> 00:50:57,787
And you know what, Angie?
I'm gonna take that as a big compliment.

576
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:00,922
Guess what time it is.
Gibsons.

577
00:51:00,999 --> 00:51:03,832
Almost. We have no onions,
so we'll have to use these.

578
00:51:03,902 --> 00:51:07,429
Seldane, the antihistamine
of champions.

579
00:51:08,473 --> 00:51:10,532
I could always make you laugh,
couldn't I?

580
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,543
You know what?
I'm gonna pass.

581
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,078
- No drink?
- No drink.

582
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:17,881
All right.
I come bearing gifts.

583
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:20,611
Some of Amy's clothes for you here.
Try these on.

584
00:51:29,194 --> 00:51:32,129
This is such a nightmare.
It's like I'm not even me anymore.

585
00:51:32,197 --> 00:51:34,188
Hey, come here.

586
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:37,359
Come on. Look at me.
You're freaking me.

587
00:51:37,435 --> 00:51:39,630
You gotta take a breath,
take a pause.

588
00:51:40,705 --> 00:51:44,641
Okay, if you're not you,
tell me who you think you are.

589
00:51:44,709 --> 00:51:47,007
- Christ, you're not even listening.
- I am listening.

590
00:51:47,078 --> 00:51:49,342
But come on.
Somebody stole your purse.

591
00:51:49,414 --> 00:51:52,440
- I didn't expect you to believe me.
- I do believe you.

592
00:51:52,517 --> 00:51:55,179
That's not true.
You know what I believe?

593
00:51:55,253 --> 00:51:57,653
I believe you're
a very frightened woman.

594
00:51:57,722 --> 00:51:59,656
In general, you're disconnected
from the human race.

595
00:51:59,724 --> 00:52:02,056
I think you're way out there
on your own.

596
00:52:02,127 --> 00:52:04,493
- You mix in your father leaving...
- Oh, no.

597
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:08,191
My father has nothing to do
with the fact that my car's missing.

598
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:10,996
It has nothing to do with the fact
that my house is empty.

599
00:52:11,069 --> 00:52:13,435
It has nothing to do with the fact
that the police department...

600
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,973
is chasing after me and that
somebody out there wants to kill me.

601
00:52:16,041 --> 00:52:19,306
I believe something happened,
but that just doesn't make sense.

602
00:52:19,377 --> 00:52:22,141
I don't want to be simplistic...

603
00:52:22,213 --> 00:52:25,307
but I think you're reaching out.

604
00:52:25,383 --> 00:52:27,874
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

605
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:30,045
I'm reaching out
to anybody who knows me...

606
00:52:30,121 --> 00:52:32,521
anybody who will listen to me
and believe me...

607
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:35,024
be my friend
and somebody to trust.

608
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:37,323
Hey, Angie, I'm sorry.

609
00:52:37,395 --> 00:52:41,559
Sometimes it's easier for me
to play doctor than it is to listen.

610
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:45,899
I just don't understand. Why me?
I am nobody. I am nothing.

611
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:48,097
But they knew everything about me.

612
00:52:48,173 --> 00:52:51,438
They knew what I ate, what I drank,
what movies I watched.

613
00:52:51,509 --> 00:52:55,343
They knew where I was from. They knew
what cigarettes I used to smoke.

614
00:52:55,413 --> 00:52:58,940
And everything they did,
they must have watched on the Internet.

615
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:01,144
I don't know.
Watched my credit cards?

616
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:04,347
Our whole lives are on the computer,
and they knew that I could be vanished.

617
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:07,687
They knew that nobody would care
and it wouldn't matter.

618
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:11,422
It's going to be okay.
What can I do?

619
00:53:11,496 --> 00:53:14,294
I need for you to take my mom
and just put her anywhere.

620
00:53:14,365 --> 00:53:16,356
I don't care where.
Just put her under a different name.

621
00:53:16,434 --> 00:53:20,131
I don't know what these people will do.
You can do that 'cause you're a doctor?

622
00:53:20,205 --> 00:53:23,299
I can put your mom
in a sanitarium for observation.

623
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:25,308
How's that?

624
00:53:25,376 --> 00:53:29,540
That would mean a lot to me,
'cause she's all I got left right now.

625
00:53:29,614 --> 00:53:31,548
All that you have left?

626
00:53:31,616 --> 00:53:35,382
Christ, Angie, they've really
gotten into your head with this.

627
00:53:35,453 --> 00:53:39,753
Put yourself in my shoes.
I don't hear from you for a long time.

628
00:53:39,824 --> 00:53:42,759
I get a phone call,
this convoluted story. Come on.

629
00:53:43,661 --> 00:53:46,789
I'm not buying the whole package,
but I'll tell you what I can do.

630
00:53:46,865 --> 00:53:49,356
I have a friend in the federal building.
His name's Ben Phillips.

631
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,664
He's an FBl agent.
Why don't I...

632
00:53:51,736 --> 00:53:55,263
I've been running from the police
ever since I got back in this country.

633
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:58,275
- That's the last thing that I need.
- Well, that's great, Angela.

634
00:53:58,343 --> 00:54:01,938
Why don't you just live the rest
of your life in this hotel room?

635
00:54:03,181 --> 00:54:05,342
Well, do you trust him?

636
00:54:05,416 --> 00:54:08,442
Yeah. I used to hold his head
over the toilet at frat parties.

637
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:10,613
Come on. I'm serious.
Do you trust him?

638
00:54:10,688 --> 00:54:12,849
Yeah, I trust Ben. I do.

639
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:17,123
Let's formulate our plan.
I'm gonna go back to my place.

640
00:54:17,195 --> 00:54:20,596
I'll figure out the best way
to transfer your mom to the sanitarium.

641
00:54:20,665 --> 00:54:23,634
Then I'll calI Ben. If I get any
information, I'll get back to you.

642
00:54:25,436 --> 00:54:28,633
Don't be so down. Come here.
It's gonna be okay.

643
00:54:28,706 --> 00:54:30,640
I'm on watch now.

644
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:34,508
You know, this would've never happened
if you had stayed with me.

645
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:39,709
Hey, Alan, thank you...

646
00:54:39,784 --> 00:54:41,877
for everything.

647
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:45,853
You're welcome.
You stay put, kiddo.

648
00:55:43,815 --> 00:55:46,807
Merci. Now prompt me, please.

649
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:51,015
Okay, you carried this around, Devlin,
because it was important.

650
00:56:00,798 --> 00:56:02,891
Bethesda Naval Hospital.

651
00:56:02,967 --> 00:56:04,730
Password.

652
00:56:06,204 --> 00:56:09,571
Okay, password.
We're gonna try you.

653
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:14,903
No. Okay.

654
00:56:14,979 --> 00:56:18,176
Well, you look familiar.
Let's try you again.

655
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,079
Come on. Okay.

656
00:56:33,364 --> 00:56:35,525
Bergstrom? What?

657
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,233
Oh, my God.

658
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:00,550
Yeah.

659
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,856
- Someone's on.
- Think it's our girl?

660
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:07,125
Whoever it is is covering their tracks.
A dozen hops so far.

661
00:57:07,198 --> 00:57:09,962
A pop in Switzerland, a Unix box
in the University of Montana...

662
00:57:10,034 --> 00:57:12,559
five different routers
at Berkeley.

663
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,697
- They know what they're doing.
- How long will it take to track her?

664
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:20,608
Depending how long she stays on,
15 minutes, half hour at most.

665
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:22,737
Call me the second you find her.

666
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:24,941
And that other matter?

667
00:57:26,084 --> 00:57:28,314
That's free of charge.

668
00:57:45,436 --> 00:57:46,698
Thanks.

669
00:58:59,677 --> 00:59:01,269
Praetorians?

670
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:05,976
What? I need more information.

671
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,644
"The Big Bad Wolf, Cyberterrorists..."

672
00:59:13,324 --> 00:59:15,417
I need more information.

673
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:20,822
"LAX, Wall Street, Atlanta.
Dangerous. Don't mess with them."

674
00:59:20,898 --> 00:59:23,492
They've already
started messing with me.

675
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,896
"Meet in IRL. In Private.

676
00:59:29,674 --> 00:59:32,234
In real life."

677
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,710
No, no.
It's gotta be a public place.

678
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:40,517
Where it's safe
with a lot of people.

679
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,520
The Santa Monica Pier by...

680
00:59:46,591 --> 00:59:48,115
Where?

681
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:49,989
The Ferris wheel.

682
01:00:02,607 --> 01:00:06,338
- Any luck?
- 8833 Rosewood in West Hollywood.

683
01:00:06,410 --> 01:00:09,470
Remind me to buy you guys
something nice.

684
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:01,463
Hello?

685
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,207
Angie!

686
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:15,272
Come on, let me in.
I'm dying out here with this food.

687
01:01:15,346 --> 01:01:17,075
Sorry.

688
01:01:18,683 --> 01:01:20,981
- I thought, you know.
- Forget it.

689
01:01:22,587 --> 01:01:26,114
I figured you'd be hungry
so I stopped on the way over.

690
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:29,216
I got your favorite.
Chinese.

691
01:01:29,293 --> 01:01:33,127
It's your favorite.
I never cared for it, remember?

692
01:01:33,197 --> 01:01:35,427
That's immaterial. I knew
it was somebody's favorite.

693
01:01:35,499 --> 01:01:37,592
- How's my mom?
- Mom is fine.

694
01:01:37,668 --> 01:01:41,069
She's safely ensconced at the
county sanitarium. Everything's good.

695
01:01:41,138 --> 01:01:43,072
- Great. Thank you.
- Listen.

696
01:01:43,140 --> 01:01:46,303
About the Chinese.
Let me make it up to you.

697
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:49,039
Let's go to that Greek restaurant.

698
01:01:49,113 --> 01:01:51,343
- I can't. I gotta go.
- Really?

699
01:01:51,415 --> 01:01:54,282
Every time I see you now
you're running away.

700
01:01:54,352 --> 01:01:57,446
I'm not. There's a guy
from the Internet...

701
01:01:57,521 --> 01:01:59,751
who might know something
about what's going on.

702
01:01:59,824 --> 01:02:03,817
Can I tell you about Ben Phillips,
the guy you wanted me to talk to?

703
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:08,888
I told him your story. He wants
to see you first thing in the morning.

704
01:02:08,966 --> 01:02:10,433
Can't you wait...

705
01:02:10,501 --> 01:02:13,698
Does he know about LAX and Wall Street,
and what happened in Atlanta?

706
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:19,641
Of course. Kids black out part of
a power grid and spell "Braves Suck."

707
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:21,644
Is that a national emergency?

708
01:02:21,712 --> 01:02:24,272
Cyberbob's figured it out,
and he knows what he's doing.

709
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:27,579
- If we don't talk, it'll be too late.
- Listen to you! Cyberbob!

710
01:02:27,652 --> 01:02:32,783
You're meeting a guy named Cyberbob!
Have you ever even seen him?

711
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:35,325
- I don't want you going alone.
- Come with me.

712
01:02:35,393 --> 01:02:39,295
- Sure. Where are we to meet him?
- Santa Monica Pier.

713
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:58,808
- Yeah?
- Hi. Bob Fox?

714
01:02:58,883 --> 01:03:02,444
These people are dangerous. They killed
Dale because of what he knew.

715
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:05,785
- They think I have this program.
- I'm with you.

716
01:03:05,856 --> 01:03:08,518
But first, somebody tries to kill you,
now this guy Dale...

717
01:03:08,592 --> 01:03:12,050
They put somebody in my place
at Cathedral to get rid of any traces.

718
01:03:12,129 --> 01:03:15,565
Why would anybody want to do this?

719
01:03:15,633 --> 01:03:19,467
They would want somebody
in Cathedral's mainframe to set traps...

720
01:03:19,537 --> 01:03:23,166
to make sure
this doesn't happen again.

721
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:25,970
That would take weeks!
You cannot do that from the outside.

722
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:29,410
Remember that Internet number
that Devlin guy had?

723
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:33,314
I plugged it in, and I'm staring
at the personaI medical files...

724
01:03:33,384 --> 01:03:35,682
of the Undersecretary of Defense
Michael Bergstrom.

725
01:03:35,753 --> 01:03:38,017
- The guy who blew his head off.
- Yeah.

726
01:03:38,089 --> 01:03:41,490
They said a computer blood test
told him he had AIDS, right?

727
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:44,426
When they did the autopsy,
there was no HIV found.

728
01:03:46,597 --> 01:03:49,760
Maybe when they do my autopsy,
I can finally prove I'm not Ruth Marx.

729
01:03:49,834 --> 01:03:53,201
What's frightening me is I'm starting
to think you're not delusional.

730
01:03:53,270 --> 01:03:55,363
I need to get back to Cathedral...

731
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:57,907
get on that Mozart's Ghost program,
'cause that's gotta be it.

732
01:03:57,975 --> 01:04:01,467
They've got this echo system
on their computers...

733
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:05,606
where you can retrace your keystrokes
in case you made a mistake.

734
01:04:05,683 --> 01:04:08,174
Are you all right?
Alan, what's the matter?

735
01:04:08,252 --> 01:04:10,584
Pull over.

736
01:04:10,654 --> 01:04:12,679
You're scaring me. Come on!

737
01:04:12,757 --> 01:04:14,247
Talk to me.

738
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:17,294
-Pills.
-What pills? What are you talking about?

739
01:04:17,361 --> 01:04:19,386
Get over here.
We'll go to the hospital.

740
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,056
Be okay, isn't he?

741
01:04:24,135 --> 01:04:26,399
He's allergic to penicillin.

742
01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:29,962
They have him intubated and pumped
full of epinephrine.

743
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,203
- I have no idea what you said.
- He's going to be fine.

744
01:04:33,277 --> 01:04:35,939
If you like, you can go see him now.

745
01:04:36,013 --> 01:04:38,846
I would like that. Thank you.

746
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,188
How do you feel?

747
01:04:55,833 --> 01:04:58,768
- I'm starving.
- Yeah?

748
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:03,934
Well, the minute you get out...

749
01:05:04,008 --> 01:05:07,671
I'll cook you the best microwave meal
you've ever had.

750
01:05:08,846 --> 01:05:10,837
How long they gonna keep me here?

751
01:05:10,915 --> 01:05:14,544
I think just another day.

752
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:18,816
And will you be handling
the outpatient care, nurse?

753
01:05:18,889 --> 01:05:21,153
Do you mind?

754
01:05:23,027 --> 01:05:28,124
Visions of sponge baths
dance in my head.

755
01:05:38,442 --> 01:05:40,569
I gotta go.

756
01:05:42,112 --> 01:05:43,704
You gonna be okay?

757
01:05:43,781 --> 01:05:48,980
I'll be fine.
I'm more worried about you.

758
01:05:50,087 --> 01:05:52,282
I'll be fine.

759
01:05:53,824 --> 01:05:56,315
Wish it was over,
but I'll be fine.

760
01:05:56,393 --> 01:05:58,088
I know.

761
01:06:00,865 --> 01:06:04,096
Come here.
I wanna tell you something.

762
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:06,932
Come closer.

763
01:06:19,116 --> 01:06:22,108
I've wanted to do that
since yesterday.

764
01:06:24,421 --> 01:06:26,582
Yeah, well...

765
01:06:26,657 --> 01:06:30,093
when you get better,
I might let you do it again.

766
01:06:33,697 --> 01:06:37,690
- Do you still think I'm crazy?
- Sure, I do.

767
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,402
Always have.

768
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:12,025
Get your cotton candy, fifty cents.

769
01:07:12,102 --> 01:07:14,036
Great picture!

770
01:07:14,104 --> 01:07:15,537
Bye.

771
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:19,238
How you doin'?
Howdy.

772
01:07:19,310 --> 01:07:23,406
Everybody's a winner!
Step right up.

773
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:27,814
Honey, wanna dance?
Give Benny a big hug.

774
01:07:27,885 --> 01:07:29,819
Come back here.

775
01:08:54,471 --> 01:09:00,068
It's safer to stay right here.
Sorry, Bob couldn't make it.

776
01:09:01,378 --> 01:09:06,315
Hey! I hope this isn't how you greet
all your old lovers.

777
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:08,715
That's not exactly the category
you fit into.

778
01:09:08,786 --> 01:09:11,254
I'm surprised you didn't kill me,
then fuck me.

779
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,954
It was difficult, right?

780
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:18,654
I was genuinely attracted to you.
I still am.

781
01:09:18,729 --> 01:09:21,493
I'm gonna genuinely attract
the Santa Monica Police...

782
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:23,829
if you don't let go of me now.

783
01:09:25,102 --> 01:09:27,866
You've been avoiding them
since you ran out of that house.

784
01:09:29,473 --> 01:09:31,941
They'd still be very interested
in hearing...

785
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:36,002
how you crashed Dale Hessman's plane,
how you tried to kill me.

786
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:39,174
- They'd love to hear about that.
- Go ahead. Feel tree.

787
01:09:39,249 --> 01:09:41,217
They'd be happy
to make your acquaintance.

788
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:45,984
Do you know that Ruth Marx
has a criminal record?

789
01:09:46,056 --> 01:09:48,251
For drugs...

790
01:09:48,325 --> 01:09:50,054
prostitution.

791
01:09:50,127 --> 01:09:55,895
- You've got quite a record.
- Almost as good as Bergstrom has.

792
01:09:55,966 --> 01:10:00,494
I know about Bergstrom's suicide
and I know alI about the Praetorians.

793
01:10:00,571 --> 01:10:02,971
I'm sure they'd love
to hear about that.

794
01:10:04,374 --> 01:10:06,535
Everybody has their button...

795
01:10:07,845 --> 01:10:11,144
and Bergstrom's just happened
to be homophobia.

796
01:10:12,883 --> 01:10:16,410
You have to know people well enough
to know...

797
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:18,284
which button to push.

798
01:10:20,023 --> 01:10:24,084
I don't have your disk.
If I had it, I would give it to you.

799
01:10:24,161 --> 01:10:26,629
- It was ruined in Mexico.
- It's okay.

800
01:10:28,332 --> 01:10:32,462
But all we need now is what's up here,
so you come with me.

801
01:10:34,004 --> 01:10:36,973
I promise you I'll look after you.
Come on.

802
01:10:41,712 --> 01:10:43,805
I don't understand.
What do you want?

803
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:49,376
It's not about what I want.
It's about what my employers want.

804
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:51,580
Take a look around you.

805
01:10:51,655 --> 01:10:54,783
Think things are working?
I don't think so.

806
01:10:54,858 --> 01:10:58,191
-They think they can make things better.
-By killing people?

807
01:10:58,262 --> 01:11:01,197
I don't ask too many questions.
I suggest you do the same.

808
01:11:01,265 --> 01:11:02,994
Big boy, dance.

809
01:11:08,205 --> 01:11:12,266
Don't push!
Hey, you, jerk! Jeez!

810
01:13:39,589 --> 01:13:42,057
Dr. Henry to ICU.

811
01:13:46,163 --> 01:13:49,098
Dr. Garcia,
stat to ambulance bay.

812
01:14:00,243 --> 01:14:03,974
Code blue, 515 west.

813
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:16,282
Everybody clear? Three hundred.
Let's go.

814
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,726
Everybody, clear.
He's got no pulse.

815
01:14:18,795 --> 01:14:21,662
Get her outta here!

816
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:23,791
He's my friend.

817
01:14:23,867 --> 01:14:26,301
- Please help me.
- Let me go!

818
01:14:28,638 --> 01:14:32,074
- Hit him again. Clear.
- Alan, no.

819
01:14:32,142 --> 01:14:34,576
Get off of me!

820
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:43,209
- Mrs. Champion, I'm sorry.
- I'm not Mrs. Champion.

821
01:14:43,286 --> 01:14:46,050
There were complications.

822
01:14:46,123 --> 01:14:48,057
Would you like me
to call you a cab?

823
01:14:48,125 --> 01:14:51,424
You're very upset.
Can someone pick you up?

824
01:14:51,495 --> 01:14:53,793
Ma'am?

825
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:56,389
Would you like to talk
with a counselor?

826
01:14:57,934 --> 01:15:00,402
Maybe you should lie down for a while.

827
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:03,564
I don't understand.
You said he was gonna be fine.

828
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,699
I know I did. I'm sorry.

829
01:15:05,776 --> 01:15:09,678
- We think the insulin caused...
- No, he was on penicillin.

830
01:15:09,746 --> 01:15:13,182
Dr. Champion was being held
for the treatment of diabetes.

831
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:17,414
- He went into insulin shock at 9:25.
- He was not a diabetic.

832
01:15:17,487 --> 01:15:20,513
I'm afraid he was.
I can pull up his files.

833
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:15,968
Hello?

834
01:17:16,039 --> 01:17:20,408
You've no idea what it does to me
hearing the sound of your voice.

835
01:17:20,477 --> 01:17:24,470
Don't hang up. Please.
This is important.

836
01:17:24,548 --> 01:17:26,140
If you would...

837
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:29,049
just take a step back
from all of this...

838
01:17:29,119 --> 01:17:32,850
you'd see that you and I,
we're really not so very different.

839
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:37,053
We're both loners.
We're both isolated.

840
01:17:37,127 --> 01:17:39,652
We're both really untrusting.

841
01:17:39,729 --> 01:17:44,689
We're both looking
for the same clarity.

842
01:17:44,768 --> 01:17:47,328
You've come to mean
a great deal to me.

843
01:17:47,404 --> 01:17:49,463
You mean shit to me.

844
01:17:49,539 --> 01:17:50,904
Look...

845
01:17:50,974 --> 01:17:55,172
I have to admit an arrogance
in my perceptions of you.

846
01:17:55,245 --> 01:17:57,736
I've come to visit a friend of mine.

847
01:17:58,748 --> 01:18:01,512
An old piano teacher friend
of mine.

848
01:18:01,585 --> 01:18:03,519
You leave my mother alone.

849
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:06,055
It seems I have no choice.

850
01:18:06,122 --> 01:18:10,058
She's being moved by Dr. Champion.

851
01:18:10,126 --> 01:18:13,755
The late Dr. Champion.

852
01:18:33,717 --> 01:18:35,776
Shit!

853
01:18:36,953 --> 01:18:40,389
Driver, this is the Highway Patrol.
Reduce speed.

854
01:18:40,457 --> 01:18:43,153
Pull over to the side of the highway
and turn off your engine.

855
01:19:14,724 --> 01:19:16,658
There it is.

856
01:19:24,868 --> 01:19:27,462
There she is! Police!

857
01:19:29,105 --> 01:19:30,766
Stop!

858
01:19:37,447 --> 01:19:40,541
My name is Angela Bennett.

859
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:46,045
Freeze! Police!

860
01:19:46,122 --> 01:19:48,056
My name's Angela Bennett.

861
01:19:49,259 --> 01:19:53,491
Get down! Get down!
Get your hands around the back.

862
01:19:53,563 --> 01:19:55,997
"You have the right to remain silent.
If you give up that right...

863
01:19:56,066 --> 01:19:59,126
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

864
01:19:59,202 --> 01:20:02,968
You have the right to an attorney and
to have him present during questioning."

865
01:20:34,738 --> 01:20:37,298
Look, I wanna help you.

866
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:41,105
I've been appointed to help you,
but everything you say is so farfetched.

867
01:20:41,177 --> 01:20:46,740
They've changed your name,
your friend's medical records because-

868
01:20:46,816 --> 01:20:49,478
Just think about it.

869
01:20:49,552 --> 01:20:52,988
Our whole world
is sitting there on a computer.

870
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:55,081
It's in the computer.
Everything.

871
01:20:55,158 --> 01:20:59,060
Your DMV records,
your Social Security...

872
01:20:59,129 --> 01:21:02,292
your credit cards,
your medical history.

873
01:21:02,365 --> 01:21:05,027
It's all right there.
Everyone is stored.

874
01:21:05,101 --> 01:21:08,229
And there's this little
electronic shadow on each of us...

875
01:21:08,304 --> 01:21:11,705
just begging for somebody
to screw with.

876
01:21:11,775 --> 01:21:15,404
They've done it to me,
and they're gonna do it to you.

877
01:21:15,478 --> 01:21:17,639
Look, Miss Marx.

878
01:21:17,714 --> 01:21:20,046
I'm not Ruth Marx.
They invented her.

879
01:21:20,116 --> 01:21:22,243
They put her on your computer
with my thumbprint.

880
01:21:22,318 --> 01:21:26,914
I hate to tell you this, but the
California Criminal Justice computers...

881
01:21:26,990 --> 01:21:31,256
all of them, have been protected
by the Gatekeeper security programs...

882
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:33,352
for the last six months...

883
01:21:33,430 --> 01:21:36,831
so nothing that you're describing
could possibly happen.

884
01:21:42,472 --> 01:21:44,770
Oh, my God.
It's the program then.

885
01:21:44,841 --> 01:21:49,505
It's... The Gatekeeper program,
it has a flaw.

886
01:21:49,579 --> 01:21:54,175
If they changed my identity and it has
a flaw, then the Praetorians know this.

887
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:57,913
- That solves it.
- Yeah. Think about it.

888
01:21:57,987 --> 01:22:01,252
You want to tell me again
how you ended up in a stolen car?

889
01:22:01,324 --> 01:22:03,417
Okay, listen to me.

890
01:22:03,493 --> 01:22:05,688
It's like a Trojan horse,
this thing.

891
01:22:05,762 --> 01:22:10,131
The Praetorians hack into computers,
and they cause this chaos.

892
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,862
LAX. Wall Street.

893
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:16,428
The Department of Water and Power
in Atlanta.

894
01:22:16,506 --> 01:22:19,168
They do this so
the people buy this program.

895
01:22:19,242 --> 01:22:22,234
They buy this program,
and they get a false sense of security.

896
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,940
Only to find out that they've
unwittingly allowed the Praetorians...

897
01:22:25,014 --> 01:22:27,949
free and exclusive access
to the system.

898
01:22:28,017 --> 01:22:31,646
Imagine what they can do with
this power. They can do anything.

899
01:22:31,721 --> 01:22:34,986
This is absolutely fascinating,
Ms. Marx.

900
01:22:35,058 --> 01:22:37,026
Please, my name is Bennett.

901
01:22:37,093 --> 01:22:39,527
Write it down if you want.
It's Bennett.

902
01:22:39,596 --> 01:22:44,363
B-E-N-N-E-T-T.
Bennett.

903
01:22:44,434 --> 01:22:47,403
I have no reason
to make any of this up.

904
01:22:47,470 --> 01:22:49,904
As your court-appointed attorney...

905
01:22:49,973 --> 01:22:52,464
I'm obligated to do what you wish...

906
01:22:52,542 --> 01:22:56,410
so I will call you "Cleopatra,
Queen of the Nile" if you want.

907
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:58,777
But take some advice.

908
01:22:58,848 --> 01:23:01,373
If you go before the judge
with this craziness...

909
01:23:01,451 --> 01:23:05,820
I guarantee you will be found
incompetent to stand trial...

910
01:23:05,889 --> 01:23:09,416
and they will hold you indefinitely.

911
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:26,738
Hi. This is her daughter.

912
01:23:32,782 --> 01:23:35,683
Hi, Mom.

913
01:23:35,752 --> 01:23:37,344
It's me.

914
01:23:38,621 --> 01:23:41,283
How're you doing?
You doing okay?

915
01:23:42,392 --> 01:23:45,520
How's that new nurse treating...
Is she...

916
01:23:48,798 --> 01:23:51,062
It's Angela.
Mom.

917
01:23:53,770 --> 01:23:55,738
It's Angela.

918
01:23:56,873 --> 01:23:59,433
Mom, listen.

919
01:23:59,509 --> 01:24:01,602
I need you to do something for me.

920
01:24:01,678 --> 01:24:05,205
There's a lady here
that I need for you...

921
01:24:05,281 --> 01:24:10,810
She's gonna get on the phone.
I need you to tell her that I'm me.

922
01:24:10,887 --> 01:24:13,583
'Cause she doesn't believe me.

923
01:24:13,656 --> 01:24:17,353
Can you tell her that?
Mom?

924
01:24:17,427 --> 01:24:19,622
Mom, don't. No.

925
01:24:20,797 --> 01:24:22,788
Are you there?

926
01:24:25,535 --> 01:24:29,062
I just want you to know
that I love you and...

927
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,376
Lady?

928
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:45,811
What?

929
01:24:52,996 --> 01:24:55,726
- Would somebody answer the damn phone?
- Here she is.

930
01:24:55,798 --> 01:24:59,029
Who's come to get me.
Can you just... I just...

931
01:24:59,102 --> 01:25:03,801
Special Agent Ben Phillips, FBl.
I'm Alan's triend.

932
01:25:03,873 --> 01:25:06,103
It's a terrible thing
what happened to him.

933
01:25:06,175 --> 01:25:09,804
I'm so glad that you're here.

934
01:25:09,879 --> 01:25:12,439
Two seconds after
Alan told me your story...

935
01:25:12,515 --> 01:25:15,712
the Computer Crimes Division
hit the bricks chasing this down...

936
01:25:15,785 --> 01:25:20,313
beating every bush from here
to eternity trying to find you.

937
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:23,018
Sorry it ended up
being a place like this.

938
01:25:23,092 --> 01:25:24,821
Me too.

939
01:25:24,894 --> 01:25:27,328
Let's get outta here,
get you someplace safe.

940
01:25:27,397 --> 01:25:30,332
We've got a field office
about 40 minutes from here.

941
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,334
Then what do we do?

942
01:25:32,402 --> 01:25:35,428
Then I'm going fishing.
A shark named Jack Devlin.

943
01:25:35,505 --> 01:25:37,700
- Ring any bells?
- Yeah.

944
01:25:37,774 --> 01:25:42,871
He's their one-man dirty-duty squad.
Smart, efficient, lethal.

945
01:25:42,945 --> 01:25:45,812
Moral conscience of a chain saw.

946
01:25:45,882 --> 01:25:50,376
Scary son of a bitch as he is,
the guys behind the keyboards are worse.

947
01:25:50,453 --> 01:25:51,920
The Praetorians.

948
01:25:51,988 --> 01:25:55,014
Our first good lead.
We've been chasing them for years.

949
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:59,994
Look, we have to move A. S. A. P. so
start sketching me a quick background.

950
01:26:00,063 --> 01:26:02,031
All right?

951
01:26:02,098 --> 01:26:03,827
Like for instance...

952
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:06,664
how the hell did you access
their system in the first place?

953
01:26:06,736 --> 01:26:10,433
I didn't. A programmer at Cathedral
sent the disk to me.

954
01:26:12,341 --> 01:26:15,970
Goddamn disk. That's what
kick-started all this, huh?

955
01:26:18,114 --> 01:26:20,776
Angie. Tell me.

956
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:24,809
Did you make a copy of the disk
before it was ruined in Mexico?

957
01:26:36,933 --> 01:26:38,901
Damn!

958
01:26:38,968 --> 01:26:42,096
The disk is only hope we have
of catching these bastards.

959
01:26:42,171 --> 01:26:44,105
Did you talk to anyone?

960
01:26:44,173 --> 01:26:46,198
Give copies of the disk to anyone?

961
01:26:47,310 --> 01:26:49,437
You guys are amazing sons of bitches.

962
01:26:49,512 --> 01:26:52,242
- Excuse me?
- Amazing. Amazing, amazing.

963
01:26:52,315 --> 01:26:55,614
How'd you know it was ruined?

964
01:26:55,685 --> 01:26:59,086
I only told Devlin it was ruined.
How'd you know it was ruined?

965
01:26:59,155 --> 01:27:03,148
What's your name? You're not with
the FBl. It doesn't even matter.

966
01:27:03,226 --> 01:27:06,923
Since I touched that disk, I've been
running from one nightmare to the next.

967
01:27:06,996 --> 01:27:10,397
I'm tired. I am out of it.
I'm so out of it.

968
01:27:12,668 --> 01:27:14,898
What are you doing?
Get off the gas!

969
01:27:14,971 --> 01:27:17,906
Let go! You're gonna kill us both!

970
01:27:17,974 --> 01:27:19,271
Let go!

971
01:27:22,211 --> 01:27:24,577
My seat belt!

972
01:29:07,984 --> 01:29:12,512
After what appeared to be playful
but costly computer tampering...

973
01:29:12,588 --> 01:29:14,954
an incident today
has taken a darker turn.

974
01:29:15,024 --> 01:29:18,460
We go live to Dermot Conley
in Chicago with that report.

975
01:29:18,527 --> 01:29:22,588
Police were called in as the recent
comedy of computer errors turned ugly...

976
01:29:22,665 --> 01:29:26,192
when six Chicago banks were forced
to shut their doors...

977
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:30,763
due to computer tampering bringing
the city's economic life to a halt.

978
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,774
It's a desperate situation.

979
01:29:32,842 --> 01:29:37,302
City services will be conducted through
the one bank unaffected by the glitches.

980
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:39,610
That bank, National Fidelity,
sources say...

981
01:29:39,682 --> 01:29:43,812
was protected by Gregg Systems'
aptly named Gatekeeper program.

982
01:29:43,886 --> 01:29:48,152
- Reporting live, Dermot Conley.
- Thank you, Dermot.

983
01:29:48,224 --> 01:29:51,284
In related news, Jeff Gregg,
billionaire founder of Gregg Systems...

984
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,294
was in Washington
for today's announcement...

985
01:29:53,362 --> 01:29:56,490
by newly appointed Undersecretary
of Defense Calvin Shoemaker...

986
01:29:56,565 --> 01:29:59,932
that the Pentagon will be outfitting
the entire federal government...

987
01:30:00,002 --> 01:30:01,936
with Gregg's touted
Gatekeeper program.

988
01:30:02,004 --> 01:30:06,304
Remember, in this day and age,
information is sacred, is power.

989
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:10,675
And society must protect that
from terrorists.

990
01:30:10,746 --> 01:30:14,011
Ironically, today's announcement
came two weeks to the day...

991
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:17,519
of the recent suicide of Shoemaker's
predecessor Michael Bergstrom...

992
01:30:17,586 --> 01:30:20,419
a vocal opponent
of the Gatekeeper program.

993
01:30:20,489 --> 01:30:24,983
In local news, a spectacular car crash
leaves one unidentified man dead.

994
01:30:25,061 --> 01:30:28,326
We go live to Lynn Blades
at the scene of the crash.

995
01:30:28,397 --> 01:30:32,128
Thank you. I am just yards away
from where the body was found...

996
01:30:32,201 --> 01:30:35,102
with a gangland-style gunshot wound
to the head.

997
01:30:35,171 --> 01:30:38,163
Police are searching
for the passenger of that car...

998
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,574
a young woman in her 20s, brunette,
going under the name of Ruth Marx...

999
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:45,808
and believed to be wanted on federal
charges of car theft.

1000
01:31:31,927 --> 01:31:34,487
All Cathedral employees,
this is a reminder...

1001
01:31:34,563 --> 01:31:36,793
that the Cathedral booth
at the Moscone Center...

1002
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:39,926
is in the northwest corner
of the convention hall.

1003
01:32:26,715 --> 01:32:28,774
Okay. All right.

1004
01:32:32,088 --> 01:32:34,750
Mozart's Ghost!
The hottest band...

1005
01:32:34,824 --> 01:32:38,555
Don't do this to me. Do not
do this to me. I am Angela Bennett.

1006
01:32:38,627 --> 01:32:40,390
Me.

1007
01:32:55,811 --> 01:32:59,303
- Cathedral Software.
- Angela Bennett, please.

1008
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:06,251
Programing. Angela Bennett.
Hello?

1009
01:33:06,322 --> 01:33:07,789
Hello?

1010
01:33:08,858 --> 01:33:11,418
Who the hell is this?

1011
01:33:13,829 --> 01:33:17,424
- You got something to say? Otherwise...
- Don't hang up.

1012
01:33:27,610 --> 01:33:29,100
Angela?

1013
01:33:56,438 --> 01:33:59,305
All right, Miss Bennett,
now that I know where you are...

1014
01:33:59,375 --> 01:34:02,071
let's see if we can get you
away from your machine.

1015
01:34:07,816 --> 01:34:10,341
How about I start a little fire...

1016
01:34:10,419 --> 01:34:12,683
right here?

1017
01:34:15,624 --> 01:34:17,421
This is a fire alarm.

1018
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:20,223
Please proceed
to the nearest emergency exit.

1019
01:34:30,839 --> 01:34:32,830
- Angela.
- What?

1020
01:34:32,908 --> 01:34:36,275
- There's a fire in the building.
- Yeah, just a sec.

1021
01:34:36,345 --> 01:34:39,712
Don't give me a sec.
Let's go!

1022
01:34:42,952 --> 01:34:44,886
Now! Come on!

1023
01:35:04,506 --> 01:35:06,770
Mozart's Ghost!
The hottest band on the Internet.

1024
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:08,537
About time.

1025
01:35:23,058 --> 01:35:24,047
Password.

1026
01:36:19,615 --> 01:36:22,311
If there's a fire, where's the smoke?
There's no smoke.

1027
01:36:22,384 --> 01:36:24,818
We're looking into it, ma'am.

1028
01:36:32,728 --> 01:36:34,127
What's this?

1029
01:36:34,196 --> 01:36:38,189
"Terminate all Mozart's Ghost files now
and terminate..."

1030
01:36:39,301 --> 01:36:40,734
Gotcha, don't I?

1031
01:36:42,271 --> 01:36:45,035
Who is Praetorian?

1032
01:36:53,916 --> 01:36:57,181
Okay, let's search you out.

1033
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:03,014
It's Gregg.

1034
01:37:03,092 --> 01:37:07,392
All Cathedral employees,
return to your workstations.

1035
01:37:07,463 --> 01:37:11,661
The fire department has advised us
this was a false alarm.

1036
01:37:15,771 --> 01:37:18,331
All clear.

1037
01:37:34,490 --> 01:37:37,584
Where are you?
There you go.

1038
01:37:56,979 --> 01:37:59,470
You did do this, didn't you?

1039
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:06,246
Come on!

1040
01:38:06,321 --> 01:38:08,755
You gotta go to the john too?

1041
01:38:13,662 --> 01:38:16,654
Disk, where are you?
Where are your disks?

1042
01:38:24,373 --> 01:38:27,240
Virus.
Thank you, Dale.

1043
01:38:56,505 --> 01:38:58,496
Save. Come on, come on.

1044
01:39:00,676 --> 01:39:01,938
Yes!

1045
01:39:05,848 --> 01:39:08,976
Thank you.
We are going to the convention.

1046
01:39:22,764 --> 01:39:23,992
Oh, my God!

1047
01:39:26,635 --> 01:39:28,569
Security.

1048
01:39:29,938 --> 01:39:32,202
Had a break-in on the fifth floor
at Cathedral.

1049
01:39:32,274 --> 01:39:37,041
You're looking for a female,
about 5'7", brunette.

1050
01:39:54,963 --> 01:39:57,693
Did you see a brunette?
Did she come by here?

1051
01:39:57,766 --> 01:40:02,032
- Sorry, nobody came by here.
- Only people are firemen.

1052
01:40:03,105 --> 01:40:04,367
Devlin.

1053
01:40:25,160 --> 01:40:27,424
- Where is she?
- She's gotta be with the firemen.

1054
01:40:27,496 --> 01:40:30,158
We have to find her now.
She's copied the disk.

1055
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:33,963
How the hell did that happen? You were
supposed to get rid of everything.

1056
01:40:34,036 --> 01:40:36,231
You were to put a bullet in her head.

1057
01:40:36,305 --> 01:40:38,569
She should never have been alive
to make that copy.

1058
01:40:42,110 --> 01:40:44,943
Smart. Better call Gregg.

1059
01:41:50,045 --> 01:41:53,037
She's gone to the Moscone Center.

1060
01:42:08,363 --> 01:42:10,991
Jesus! She could be anywhere.
Are you sure she's out there?

1061
01:42:11,066 --> 01:42:13,057
She's out there.

1062
01:42:13,135 --> 01:42:15,865
She won't be hiding in some corner.

1063
01:42:15,937 --> 01:42:18,132
She came here to use a computer.

1064
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:08,913
Get away from the computer.

1065
01:44:11,052 --> 01:44:14,920
What did you think you were trying
to do? Save the world?

1066
01:44:14,990 --> 01:44:17,288
Not the world, just myself.

1067
01:44:17,359 --> 01:44:20,954
It's too late for that.
The offer's been withdrawn.

1068
01:44:21,029 --> 01:44:23,122
Look at the screen.

1069
01:44:23,198 --> 01:44:27,464
Everything on that disk was just sent
to the FBl. Everything.

1070
01:44:27,536 --> 01:44:29,629
So?

1071
01:44:29,704 --> 01:44:32,605
Proof that the Gatekeeper program
has a back door.

1072
01:44:34,409 --> 01:44:35,842
My, my.

1073
01:44:35,911 --> 01:44:39,506
Proof that Bergstrom and Dale's murder
were orchestrated by Gregg.

1074
01:44:39,581 --> 01:44:41,981
Watch her.

1075
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:45,178
The beauty of the Gatekeeper system
is that we can get in the FBl...

1076
01:44:45,253 --> 01:44:48,051
like it's the public library.

1077
01:44:48,123 --> 01:44:50,318
It's a beautiful system.

1078
01:44:51,726 --> 01:44:54,388
Let's finish and get out.
These people make me nervous.

1079
01:44:57,299 --> 01:44:59,130
No harm done.

1080
01:44:59,201 --> 01:45:03,228
Everything you've done will be wiped out
by just escaping the system.

1081
01:45:03,305 --> 01:45:04,738
Really?

1082
01:45:16,084 --> 01:45:19,918
Goddamn it, you're in the mainframe.
It's eating through Gregg's system.

1083
01:45:19,988 --> 01:45:21,353
Do something.

1084
01:45:22,724 --> 01:45:25,158
It's a virus eating through
the Gatekeeper program.

1085
01:45:25,227 --> 01:45:28,390
There's gonna be nothing left.
Everything will be destroyed.

1086
01:45:31,066 --> 01:45:33,261
Take the far side!

1087
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:06,294
Stop!

1088
01:46:28,857 --> 01:46:29,949
Shit!

1089
01:47:31,186 --> 01:47:33,120
It's just you and me now.

1090
01:47:35,090 --> 01:47:37,786
Do you realize
you've changed everything?

1091
01:47:39,728 --> 01:47:43,255
Yeah. One little stroke of the key...

1092
01:47:43,331 --> 01:47:46,858
and you've wiped out my employer.

1093
01:47:48,770 --> 01:47:51,534
You've canceled my contract.

1094
01:47:51,606 --> 01:47:54,905
You've reversed everything
they've done to you.

1095
01:47:54,976 --> 01:47:58,468
Taken back your life.
That's what you wanted, wasn't it?

1096
01:48:18,666 --> 01:48:20,896
I knew you'd do the right thing.

1097
01:49:06,714 --> 01:49:09,649
- It's not responding to anything.
- Try a new password.

1098
01:49:52,994 --> 01:49:55,462
Excuse me, Miss.

1099
01:49:56,564 --> 01:49:59,761
I can't remember
what you told me to plant.

1100
01:50:01,202 --> 01:50:04,694
Why don't I come outside
and help you?

1101
01:50:08,343 --> 01:50:11,005
The law caught up with billionaire
Jeff Gregg today...

1102
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:15,311
as FBl agents escorted him
from his exclusive New York penthouse.

1103
01:50:15,383 --> 01:50:19,615
Gregg will be arraigned tomorrow
on nine counts of conspiracy, fraud...

1104
01:50:19,687 --> 01:50:24,715
and complicity in the death of
Undersecretary of Defense Bergstrom.

1105
01:50:24,792 --> 01:50:28,387
An FBl spokesperson attributes
the surprising arrest...

1106
01:50:28,463 --> 01:50:33,400
to a transmission sent over the Internet
by an Angela Bennett...

1107
01:50:33,468 --> 01:50:36,733
a program systems analyst
from Los Angeles.

1108
01:50:36,804 --> 01:50:40,604
In other news, San Francisco police
are investigating...

1109
01:50:40,675 --> 01:50:44,805
two mysterious deaths
at the Pan-Pacific computer convention.

1110
01:50:44,879 --> 01:50:48,280
A young woman found shot to death
in a back-room area...

1111
01:50:48,349 --> 01:50:52,080
has been identified
as 28-year-old Ruth Marx.

1112
01:50:52,153 --> 01:50:56,886
The other deceased, a male
in his 30s, is as yet unidentified.

1113
01:50:56,958 --> 01:50:59,358
Turning now to weather,
the forecast for the weekend...

1114
01:50:59,427 --> 01:51:02,157
is bright and sunny
with patchy early-morning clouds.

1115
01:51:02,230 --> 01:51:05,631
It seems like summer
is finally here.
