1
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:41,078
- Dr. Merivel.
- In a moment.

2
00:01:41,127 --> 00:01:43,197
- Doctor!
- In a moment!

3
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:45,443
- Merivel, we must move on.
- I've sprinkled the lavell in to heal.

4
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:48,604
This will strengthen the hand. We must
not allow the tendons to atrophy.

5
00:01:48,687 --> 00:01:50,564
- Merivel!
- I'll return this afternoon.

6
00:01:50,647 --> 00:01:53,719
Old Mr. Parr is suffering from
an extreme shortness of breath.

7
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:58,318
- What do you prescribe?
- Let's try some syrup of sage flower.

8
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,801
- Doctor! Doctor!
- Citron pills to relieve coughing.

9
00:02:00,887 --> 00:02:03,321
- Doctor! - I shall be with you
presently, Mr. Watchurst.

10
00:02:05,327 --> 00:02:07,158
- I'm starving.
- You can't be.

11
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:09,078
- I am.
- You've already eaten.

12
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:11,476
I had a piece of bread
and scarcely any cheese.

13
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,398
There's no time to eat!

14
00:02:13,447 --> 00:02:16,325
For the five years we've worked here,
there is never time to eat.

15
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:19,598
There is no time to drink. There is no
time, even, to look after our patients.

16
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:22,360
Doctor! Doctor Merivel!

17
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:24,403
Samuel needs you.

18
00:02:24,447 --> 00:02:27,325
Sam-Samuel! Samuel!
Look... Look at me!

19
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:32,236
It's Robert. It's Robert. Quiet now.
Be quiet. Be quiet.

20
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:36,764
Merivel! You must see to Parr.
He'll only accept comfort from you.

21
00:02:36,847 --> 00:02:39,884
Give him a complice for his head
and some chamomile.

22
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,361
Mr. Parr!

23
00:02:42,447 --> 00:02:46,122
Mr. Parr, tell me
how you're feeling.

24
00:02:46,247 --> 00:02:49,922
Is there hope
I will get well again?

25
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:52,316
There is always hope.

26
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:58,201
You must rest and allow
my medicines to do their work.

27
00:02:58,287 --> 00:03:02,565
Dr. Merivel!
Doctor!

28
00:03:02,647 --> 00:03:04,478
I-I do what I can
to treat them.

29
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,400
But our science gives us no hope
of curing most of them,

30
00:03:07,447 --> 00:03:09,483
and I am frustrated!

31
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,206
No, I'm... frightened.

32
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,124
Of what?

33
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:17,005
Their faith
and my ignorance.

34
00:03:17,087 --> 00:03:20,159
That is why you prefer
a life of debauchery.

35
00:03:20,287 --> 00:03:23,438
Your mother died believing
you were a man of honor.

36
00:03:23,527 --> 00:03:27,759
And I beg her pardon every night, and
I am at the hospital every day for her.

37
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,561
You mean your whoring is interrupted
daily by the care of the sick.

38
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:34,605
You've not come to me for money
to spend on your medicines.

39
00:03:34,647 --> 00:03:37,286
Indeed I have, in a sense.

40
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:39,927
The five shillings
I require are for...

41
00:03:40,007 --> 00:03:43,238
well, for a pawnbroker so I can
redeem my case of instruments.

42
00:03:43,287 --> 00:03:45,403
Father, I am sorry
to confess it.

43
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,876
- You should be damned for it.
- I should.

44
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,487
Look. Look at these hands.
Look at them.

45
00:03:50,567 --> 00:03:53,001
Worked to the bone for
your case of instruments,

46
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:55,925
for your teachers and for
the books on your table.

47
00:03:56,007 --> 00:03:58,362
Or have they
been pawned too?

48
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,081
So that the son of a glove maker...

49
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,965
should not be denied
the use of those gifts...

50
00:04:04,007 --> 00:04:07,556
which marked you as a physician
before you could spell "physic".

51
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:09,404
My gifts?

52
00:04:09,487 --> 00:04:11,318
Your gifts, Robert.

53
00:04:11,407 --> 00:04:13,238
Oh, yes, my gifts.

54
00:04:13,327 --> 00:04:16,239
My first patient was a frog.
I cured him of jumping.

55
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,477
Now I can cure people
of breathing.

56
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:21,127
My gifts, Father, bring me
to dark despair in dark rooms...

57
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,237
so I can hear joy
in the street.

58
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:26,245
The King is restored to us,
the theaters are open,

59
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:29,006
the tailors and wig makers
are happy as whores...

60
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:31,681
and rich men
go to heaven again.

61
00:04:31,767 --> 00:04:34,235
I would like to shake
the King's hand.

62
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:36,363
Take the hand of your
friend Pearce, Robert.

63
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,443
He is the example
to follow.

64
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:40,717
He may dress like a crow,

65
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:43,122
but he once infected himself
with scarlet fever,

66
00:04:43,207 --> 00:04:45,038
the better to study
the disease.

67
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:48,642
Well, in my own small way,
I'm doing the same for the clap.

68
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,564
Look at this glove.
Touch it.

69
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:01,399
This glove
is for the King.

70
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:04,559
And that is the closest
you will ever get...

71
00:05:04,607 --> 00:05:08,316
to touching the hand
of the King of England.

72
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:14,001
Here are your
five shillings.

73
00:05:15,527 --> 00:05:18,041
Redeem your case
of instruments.

74
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:21,523
And if you've a heart,

75
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:23,882
redeem your gift, Robert.

76
00:05:23,967 --> 00:05:27,198
Thank you, Father.

77
00:05:27,287 --> 00:05:29,039
And don't spend
the money on women.

78
00:05:34,927 --> 00:05:37,725
Merivel! I must prevail on you...

79
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,837
to come to the examining
theater this instant.

80
00:05:39,927 --> 00:05:42,521
I won't be
a moment, Pearce.

81
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,684
Merivel!

82
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:51,360
He's probably fled
because of your antics.

83
00:05:51,407 --> 00:05:54,444
Pearce, you must not take
my romping as an affront to you.

84
00:05:54,487 --> 00:05:56,557
I simply answer
the call of nature.

85
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,525
Yes, well, your nature,
like mine, is very much fallen.

86
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:02,604
That awful truth ought to go somewhere
towards discouraging your unsightly...

87
00:06:02,727 --> 00:06:04,683
bouts of debauchery.

88
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:08,555
I suppose you're right.
But I do very much enjoy them.

89
00:06:08,687 --> 00:06:11,485
This is the fellow.

90
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:21,798
Shall I unbuckle?

91
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:24,117
Please, yes.

92
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:35,721
Good God!

93
00:06:35,847 --> 00:06:37,838
A fracture of the ribs occasioned
by a fall from his horse...

94
00:06:37,927 --> 00:06:39,918
was brought to
a terrible suppuration.

95
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:42,322
The doctors feared
it would never heal.

96
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:45,120
You can see the sconce of
the old ulcer at the edge here.

97
00:06:45,207 --> 00:06:47,038
Yes.

98
00:06:47,127 --> 00:06:51,120
Merivel, we are witnessing
a living, beating heart.

99
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:54,159
Might a man touch it
with his hand?

100
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,602
No one has ever dared.

101
00:06:57,807 --> 00:07:01,004
Yes. Yes?

102
00:07:14,007 --> 00:07:15,838
Sir?

103
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,523
I cannot.

104
00:07:24,607 --> 00:07:27,997
- Pearce, it's just...
- Please! I mean... Just please...

105
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:29,958
Perhaps your friend.

106
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:46,237
Are you not afraid?

107
00:07:46,327 --> 00:07:49,205
I'm beyond fear, sir.
Are you?

108
00:08:07,247 --> 00:08:10,683
You're touching
the organ, sir?

109
00:08:10,767 --> 00:08:13,327
Can you not feel my grip?

110
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:16,126
I feel nothing at all.

111
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:18,038
No pain?

112
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:20,004
Nothing.

113
00:08:25,327 --> 00:08:28,842
Tell me, who is
the young doctor?

114
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,158
Robert Merivel,
Your Majesty.

115
00:08:33,687 --> 00:08:36,997
You will summon him to the palace
this very afternoon.

116
00:08:45,407 --> 00:08:48,319
Watch where you're going,
you fool!

117
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:50,844
Your stockings.

118
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:03,157
It's the young doctor,
Your Majesty.

119
00:10:05,047 --> 00:10:07,322
Do you know why
I've summoned you here?

120
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,198
I...

121
00:10:20,007 --> 00:10:22,237
A great heaviness
hangs over me...

122
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,717
causing me a most
abject desperation.

123
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:31,126
Someone very close to me
is dying.

124
00:10:31,207 --> 00:10:33,641
Someone without whom
I cannot live.

125
00:10:35,447 --> 00:10:38,245
My doctors have
bled her repeatedly;

126
00:10:38,287 --> 00:10:41,962
have tried, without success,
lesions, emetics and purges.

127
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,596
Shaved the hair off her body
in order to cup her.

128
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:47,956
But she does not rally.

129
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:53,565
You are my final hope,
Merivel.

130
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:57,600
If you can cure her, I will offer you
a place here as a court physician.

131
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:59,757
And if I fail?

132
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:04,442
You must not fail.

133
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:10,719
Her name is Lou Lou.

134
00:11:10,767 --> 00:11:13,440
"Lou Lou", Your Majesty?

135
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:16,240
Your own name, by the way,
has a very pleasing cadence.

136
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:18,158
Thank you, Sire.

137
00:11:18,247 --> 00:11:21,523
Merivel.
Very pretty to the ear.

138
00:11:27,207 --> 00:11:29,084
Lou Lou?

139
00:11:31,527 --> 00:11:33,836
Oh, my darling is not well.

140
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:37,841
Come, Merivel.

141
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:44,646
Call for any medicines,
anything you deem suitable.

142
00:11:48,247 --> 00:11:50,920
You will stay until the
little creature recovers.

143
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,878
Of course.

144
00:11:56,447 --> 00:11:58,483
Do not disappoint me,
Merivel.

145
00:11:58,527 --> 00:12:00,438
I shall not, Sire.

146
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:12,765
There was a time
she would've answered me.

147
00:12:22,847 --> 00:12:25,156
What have they done to you?

148
00:12:50,127 --> 00:12:52,163
My dear Pearce,

149
00:12:52,207 --> 00:12:55,358
by the time you read this letter
my fate will be sealed.

150
00:12:55,447 --> 00:12:58,598
This morning, my future
never glowed so bright,

151
00:12:58,687 --> 00:13:02,362
and now it is sputtering out
in the life of a sick spaniel.

152
00:13:02,447 --> 00:13:05,996
If I save her, my life
will be changed utterly.

153
00:13:06,047 --> 00:13:09,596
If she dies,
I may as well go with her.

154
00:13:09,687 --> 00:13:12,201
I think of our great teacher,
William Harvey.

155
00:13:12,247 --> 00:13:15,319
Though I was often drunk at his
lectures, I remember his cry:

156
00:13:18,327 --> 00:13:21,444
"Trust in the power of nature."

157
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:26,124
Is that the best hope now,
for Lou Lou and me?

158
00:13:26,207 --> 00:13:30,564
To let her sleep and give nature
a chance to work quietly within her?

159
00:13:30,647 --> 00:13:33,400
But what if I'm wrong?

160
00:13:33,447 --> 00:13:37,918
How will I explain this
prescription to His Majesty?

161
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:30,595
This is well done.
I like you, Merivel.

162
00:14:30,727 --> 00:14:33,560
Yours is a curious
and original mind.

163
00:14:33,647 --> 00:14:36,923
And in this new age,
originality is of great value.

164
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,995
We shall open our palace
to you, Merivel...

165
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,123
its treasures
and temptations...

166
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,601
and we shall see
what you make of yourself.

167
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,877
Thank you, Sire.

168
00:14:53,007 --> 00:14:55,885
You have been given an extraordinary
opportunity for one of your rank.

169
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,804
Haven't I?
I have...

170
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,964
- You must at every moment
please the King. - That would mean...

171
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:03,840
- If you do not, suffice it to say,
I shall be watching. - Good.

172
00:15:03,927 --> 00:15:07,203
Now it is my task to lay out for you
your life in this place.

173
00:15:10,007 --> 00:15:13,158
This shall be your lodging.

174
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,398
The royal tailors will be
continually at your disposal.

175
00:15:17,807 --> 00:15:21,402
And these shall be
your playfellows.

176
00:15:35,327 --> 00:15:40,003
This paper sets forth the following
duties for one Robert Merivel, physician:

177
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:43,796
The daily care and comfort
of the 18 royal dogs...

178
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:47,721
with, as required, the right
to perform operations upon them.

179
00:15:47,767 --> 00:15:52,204
It's ten years wasted. I'm warning you,
your life will be undone.

180
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:56,081
No, not wasted, Pearce, for those years
have brought me to this new life.

181
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,920
I'm to the palace,
and that's an end of it.

182
00:16:05,127 --> 00:16:08,005
My dear, we must be
pleased for each other.

183
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:10,243
You must be pleased
for my appointment...

184
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:14,843
as I am pleased that you have,
uh, given up drinking sack.

185
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:17,566
And found my peace
in Quakerism.

186
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:20,326
Even so, Pearce.
Even so.

187
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,958
My dear Pearce,

188
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,197
a year has passed
most profitably and pleasurably,

189
00:16:30,287 --> 00:16:32,517
leaving me no moment
in which to write to you.

190
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,922
All day I am thick
in the affairs of state,

191
00:16:34,967 --> 00:16:37,401
yet I manage to employ
my medical knowledge...

192
00:16:37,447 --> 00:16:40,041
especially in anatomy...
in the services of the King,

193
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:43,796
who's particularly fond
of my trick of farting at will.

194
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,084
I am Aeolius,

195
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:49,761
King of the Winds!

196
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,882
That my dear departed father
could see me now,

197
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:59,162
for the King shows me
a flattering affection...

198
00:16:59,247 --> 00:17:02,478
that stems, I suspect,
from my ability to amuse him.

199
00:17:26,247 --> 00:17:30,001
Our physician
has become our fool.

200
00:17:45,327 --> 00:17:48,125
What do you make
of the preparations, Merivel?

201
00:17:48,207 --> 00:17:50,926
Oh, sir. Most wondrous, Sire!
What is it for?

202
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,237
- A wedding.
- Ohh!

203
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:55,437
- A most lavish affair!
- Yes.

204
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,202
- Who's to be married?
- Celia Clemence.

205
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:03,360
Um... I understood
she was your mistress.

206
00:18:03,407 --> 00:18:05,557
Then you understood
right, Merivel.

207
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:07,638
That is generosity indeed.

208
00:18:07,727 --> 00:18:09,763
Merivel, let me explain.

209
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,843
Celia Clemence's
presence in my bed...

210
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:14,236
continues to be necessity.

211
00:18:14,287 --> 00:18:17,836
So, too, does that of my grand amour,
Barbara Castlemaine.

212
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:20,760
But her tantrums on the
subject of Miss Clemence...

213
00:18:20,887 --> 00:18:22,878
are making me edgy.

214
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:26,357
So... Miss Clemence
is to be married...

215
00:18:26,447 --> 00:18:30,042
and seemingly dispatched
out of London with her husband,

216
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:33,597
while, in fact, I secret her
near the river in Kew,

217
00:18:33,687 --> 00:18:35,882
the better to sport
with her unobserved.

218
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:40,681
And for her husband, I need a man...

219
00:18:40,727 --> 00:18:42,843
who is far too enamored
of women in general...

220
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:44,679
to make the mistake of
loving one in particular.

221
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:47,600
Ah! Again, a most superior
aspect of the plan.

222
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:50,485
And whom has Your Majesty chosen
for this particular honor?

223
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,162
Yes, in fact I've decided that you
should be the one to marry her, Merivel.

224
00:18:55,327 --> 00:18:57,158
Marry, Your Majesty?

225
00:18:57,247 --> 00:19:00,239
"Marry Merivel." The phrase
is very pretty to my ear.

226
00:19:00,287 --> 00:19:02,482
But, Sire,
I do not wish to marry...

227
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,519
I'm not asking you to wish it.
I'm asking you to do it.

228
00:19:06,887 --> 00:19:09,401
Merivel, have I not done you
very many favors in the past?

229
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,318
Yes, Sire,
many favors, but...

230
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:14,843
- Voila. You owe me
at least one in return.

231
00:19:16,287 --> 00:19:19,006
I shall, of course,
reward you for it.

232
00:19:19,087 --> 00:19:23,638
Make you a knight, give you
a most agreeable estate in Suffolk...

233
00:19:23,687 --> 00:19:26,599
- and my second best bed.
- I would prefer to stay at court.

234
00:19:26,687 --> 00:19:28,837
No, no.
You will go to Suffolk...

235
00:19:28,927 --> 00:19:31,236
and you will make something
of the house.

236
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:33,357
And, perhaps,
if the time is right,

237
00:19:33,447 --> 00:19:35,722
we shall favor you
with a visit.

238
00:19:35,767 --> 00:19:38,076
- Aye.
- Go now.

239
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:42,763
Only remember this, Merivel:
If she's over there with you,

240
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:47,005
there will be no intimacy
of any kind between you.

241
00:19:47,087 --> 00:19:50,875
Though she is your wife,
she is yours in name only.

242
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:54,397
You are to be
a paper bridegroom.

243
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:59,157
Voila, mademoiselle.

244
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:04,316
Un, deux,

245
00:20:04,407 --> 00:20:06,284
troix.

246
00:20:09,287 --> 00:20:12,563
"Sir Robert Merivel, Bidnold".

247
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,883
Nova vel noviter inventa.

248
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:20,004
Observationes proprias
et alienas recensere...

249
00:20:20,047 --> 00:20:23,244
ad considerandum
propriam opinionem...

250
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,597
vel obsignatis tabulis...

251
00:20:25,647 --> 00:20:29,765
in aliis animalibus agere
secundum Socratis regulam.

252
00:20:29,847 --> 00:20:34,238
Unde observationes exoticas...

253
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,602
I've come to give you these.

254
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:43,481
- These are... These are your medical books.
#HIV!
- I know.

255
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:47,355
- Your copy of Harvey.
- I know.

256
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:50,479
I have resolved
to abandon medicine.

257
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,684
The King has made
other plans for me.

258
00:20:53,767 --> 00:20:57,555
I have been given a knighthood,
an estate and a wife.

259
00:20:57,607 --> 00:21:01,236
This is my time of preferment, Pearce.
This is my time.

260
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,477
What?

261
00:21:03,527 --> 00:21:05,404
Nothing.

262
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:07,278
Merivel!

263
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:11,765
When you stood in this room...

264
00:21:11,847 --> 00:21:14,156
and put your hand
around that man's heart...

265
00:21:14,247 --> 00:21:17,319
something I did not dare do
that day...

266
00:21:17,407 --> 00:21:20,638
your vital flame
was burning.

267
00:21:20,687 --> 00:21:25,442
Now, you see, the light
has gone out of your eyes.

268
00:21:25,487 --> 00:21:28,479
No, my study of medicine
has given me nothing...

269
00:21:28,607 --> 00:21:31,280
but a perpetual and visible
awareness of mortality;

270
00:21:31,327 --> 00:21:35,036
that were I to continue, it would
very shortly bring me to despair.

271
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,357
- Very well.
- I must see to my dogs.

272
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:39,602
Very well!

273
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,398
Merivel!

274
00:21:45,647 --> 00:21:47,478
Merivel!

275
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:49,398
Merivel!

276
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:53,196
Harvey revealed his work to us
so that treading in the same path...

277
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:55,926
we might discover very many things
as yet unknown to others.

278
00:21:56,007 --> 00:21:58,885
- You have a gift for healing, Merivel.
- I do not!

279
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:02,880
Yes. Oh, yes, you do.
For understanding sickness.

280
00:22:02,967 --> 00:22:05,720
Death is a terrible thing, Pearce.

281
00:22:05,767 --> 00:22:08,759
I need color and light,
not darkness and death.

282
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:11,566
I feel I've had quite enough
of dark things.

283
00:22:11,607 --> 00:22:14,565
I want bright things
and decorative things.

284
00:22:14,647 --> 00:22:17,923
I am, after all,
a creature of the new age.

285
00:22:19,647 --> 00:22:21,603
I shall pray for you.

286
00:22:24,207 --> 00:22:26,880
Come along, Mr. Bung.

287
00:22:43,207 --> 00:22:45,516
Your bride.

288
00:24:07,207 --> 00:24:10,119
He filled your jar with spice!

289
00:24:10,247 --> 00:24:13,045
To the wedding chamber!

290
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:25,318
- Bed her well, Merivel!
Bed her well, Merivel!

291
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:27,403
Bed her well, Merivel!

292
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:30,320
Bed her well, Merivel!
Bed her well!

293
00:24:30,407 --> 00:24:33,956
Bed her well, Merivel!
Bed her well, Merivel!

294
00:24:34,007 --> 00:24:38,717
Bed her well, Merivel!

295
00:24:43,167 --> 00:24:44,998
Fair thee well!

296
00:24:48,807 --> 00:24:52,004
- I believe our kiss
convinced them, Lady Celia.

297
00:25:07,207 --> 00:25:10,722
Well done, Merivel.

298
00:25:10,847 --> 00:25:14,078
Well done!
We fooled 'em all.

299
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:20,437
You are a most useful fellow, Merivel.
Most useful!

300
00:25:22,047 --> 00:25:25,278
And at the moment you
are most useful to me...

301
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:27,562
in Suffolk.

302
00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,962
Oh. Yes.

303
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:40,238
Your disguise is behind the pillar.

304
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,845
Pearce, this will make no sense to you,

305
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:13,997
as it makes no sense to me,

306
00:26:14,087 --> 00:26:17,921
but the moment I saw Lady Celia
I was captivated by her.

307
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:20,919
When I think of her,
I feel faint, my heart aches...

308
00:26:21,007 --> 00:26:23,521
and I fear
there is no cure for me,

309
00:26:23,607 --> 00:26:26,565
for I cannot stop thinking
of her, even in my sleep.

310
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:45,162
Sir Robert!

311
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:49,280
Welcome to Bidnold.

312
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:56,956
Ah, Will Gates
at your service.

313
00:27:04,407 --> 00:27:06,637
You are alone, sir?

314
00:27:06,727 --> 00:27:10,083
Yes. Lady Merivel desired
that I act as a vanguard...

315
00:27:10,127 --> 00:27:12,163
and see the lay of the land.

316
00:27:12,207 --> 00:27:14,801
I trust that the wedding
went off as planned.

317
00:27:16,247 --> 00:27:20,320
Yes, most well.
Um, I shall now retire.

318
00:27:24,607 --> 00:27:27,326
Oh, could you send up
some strong liquor?

319
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:29,238
Yes, sir.

320
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,797
Good morning, Sir Robert.

321
00:27:40,807 --> 00:27:43,719
Mr. Gates, I find
the house induces in me...

322
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:45,962
a most melancholy
frame of mind.

323
00:27:46,047 --> 00:27:48,641
And exceeding dark.

324
00:27:48,687 --> 00:27:51,042
The King confiscated it
from a Puritan.

325
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:52,998
Oh.

326
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,597
Mr. Gates.

327
00:27:56,687 --> 00:27:59,076
I must be straight
with you.

328
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:04,195
We shall not expect
Lady Merivel's arrival for some time.

329
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:08,564
Well...

330
00:28:10,287 --> 00:28:13,279
one cannot stay in bed
indefinitely.

331
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:17,525
What one needs
is a diversion.

332
00:28:17,607 --> 00:28:20,644
The King told me to make
something of the house.

333
00:28:20,727 --> 00:28:24,959
Oh! And you
are monarch here.

334
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:29,762
We shall have color and light!

335
00:28:29,887 --> 00:28:32,606
With purples and golds
and crimsons and scarlets and carmines.

336
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:35,480
- What, all together in one place, sir?
- Yes, Mr. Gates.

337
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:38,326
We will make this house
so beautiful that if Lady Celia

338
00:28:38,327 --> 00:28:41,085
were to pay us a visit,
she would never want to leave.

339
00:28:41,167 --> 00:28:43,317
Ah, the Dutchman.

340
00:28:43,407 --> 00:28:45,238
Yes!

341
00:28:46,567 --> 00:28:48,558
All of it!

342
00:28:51,927 --> 00:28:53,838
Yes!

343
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,206
Mr. Gates, to divert myself further...

344
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,881
and to display
our lavish decoration,

345
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:07,441
I feel the urge for company.

346
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:09,557
Perhaps a visit
from the neighbors...

347
00:29:09,647 --> 00:29:12,400
will restore my old
uncontainable nature.

348
00:29:12,487 --> 00:29:15,081
A pox on wisdom!

349
00:29:15,127 --> 00:29:17,960
Let us all be
mares and stallions.

350
00:29:24,287 --> 00:29:26,357
Sir Robert,
someone at the door.

351
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:31,123
What? At the door? Another man come
to whinny in our festivities!

352
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,840
Why do you not have
a turban?

353
00:29:33,887 --> 00:29:36,481
Guy, supply Mr. Gates
with a turban!

354
00:29:40,607 --> 00:29:43,280
Sir Robert Merivel.

355
00:29:50,407 --> 00:29:52,557
Oh, Lady...

356
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:54,763
Would you show me
immediately to my rooms?

357
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:57,281
Yes, of course,
and without delay.

358
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:59,483
Without delay.

359
00:30:21,647 --> 00:30:23,478
Where am I?

360
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:26,718
I attempted to take you back
to your room last night, sir,

361
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:30,203
but you were most
insistent to sleep here.

362
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,637
What...
What's the bird?

363
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:36,804
A gift from Lady Violet.

364
00:30:39,127 --> 00:30:42,324
Oh, Mr. Gates, I've just had
a most extraordinary dream.

365
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,963
I dreamed that Lady Celia did arrive
at Bidnold in the most foul humor.

366
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm afraid she did, sir, and she
has now repaired to the garden room.

367
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:53,805
All right, now, gently. Gently.

368
00:31:00,087 --> 00:31:01,918
Careful! Careful!

369
00:31:02,007 --> 00:31:03,884
I've got it.

370
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:05,798
Keep it to your left.

371
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:11,962
Lady Celia.

372
00:31:12,007 --> 00:31:15,044
I have come to bid you
welcome to Bidnold.

373
00:31:15,127 --> 00:31:17,595
No, I do not desire
to be made welcome.

374
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:21,566
- The King will very soon ask me
back to him. - I'm sure he will.

375
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:25,162
I'm sure he has of late been
most distracted by the foreign wars.

376
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:27,926
But in the meantime,
if there's any comfort...

377
00:31:28,007 --> 00:31:30,237
I might provide here at Bidnold
for Your Ladyship...

378
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:33,120
No, there is nothing.
Nothing.

379
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:39,441
Well... um, well, then
together we shall wait...

380
00:31:39,527 --> 00:31:42,644
for the return
of the King's love.

381
00:31:42,687 --> 00:31:45,963
Love?
You use that word?

382
00:31:46,047 --> 00:31:48,686
The King and his love for me
made use of you.

383
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:52,163
He looked around for the stupidest man
he could find, and he found you.

384
00:31:52,247 --> 00:31:55,284
I begged him not to marry me
to such a fool.

385
00:31:55,367 --> 00:31:59,280
I have brought a...

386
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:02,040
Stay away from me.

387
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:08,523
"Celia, my loneliness consumes me,

388
00:32:08,647 --> 00:32:12,435
but I see your unhappiness
is as great as mine."

389
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:40,596
Well, come in, please.

390
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:43,485
I hope my playing
isn't disturbing you.

391
00:32:43,527 --> 00:32:46,246
No, it is I
who am disturbing you.

392
00:32:46,327 --> 00:32:48,966
I... No.

393
00:32:49,047 --> 00:32:51,083
What is the bird?

394
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:55,718
I am told it is an Indian nightingale.
It was a gift.

395
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,327
- From the King?
- Yes, from the King.

396
00:33:05,247 --> 00:33:08,364
- It's most beautiful.
- Mmm.

397
00:33:08,447 --> 00:33:11,200
- Only it does not sing.
- No.

398
00:33:11,287 --> 00:33:13,437
Perhaps it wants
encouragement.

399
00:33:13,567 --> 00:33:17,526
Now, if it were to hear you play,
for your playing, as I recall,

400
00:33:17,567 --> 00:33:20,604
has about it an exceeding sweetness.

401
00:33:23,087 --> 00:33:26,159
Would it be asking too much
if I were to keep the bird in my room?

402
00:33:26,247 --> 00:33:28,636
No, nothing would be
too much. Will!

403
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:31,287
No, no. I'll...

404
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:34,882
And let the garden room
be my private habitation,

405
00:33:34,927 --> 00:33:38,522
where I shall perhaps
from time to time invite you.

406
00:33:41,207 --> 00:33:42,560
Um...

407
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,121
I find much of the decoration
here rather disturbing.

408
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:47,641
Yes, certain of the servants
regularly complain of it.

409
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:51,476
Merivel, forgive me if I spoke before
of matters that do not regard me.

410
00:33:51,527 --> 00:33:56,078
We live in an age where many
are made fools and many are deceived.

411
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,921
I, in my faith for the King's love,
am probably as foolish as you.

412
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:16,038
Oh.

413
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:20,286
It's from my old friend,
Mr. Pearce.

414
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:24,525
It seems he's now working
in a hospital with his Quakers.

415
00:34:28,247 --> 00:34:31,956
Will, will you sit down?
Please.

416
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,078
Is there a Mrs. Gates?

417
00:34:42,127 --> 00:34:44,925
Oh, no, sir.

418
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:50,405
The messy constellations
I see through my telescope...

419
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:52,518
offer me no clue
to my destiny.

420
00:34:52,607 --> 00:34:56,600
There is, I fear, a great deal
about the world and my role in it...

421
00:34:56,687 --> 00:35:00,521
which, despite all my early learning,
I have utterly failed to understand.

422
00:35:03,487 --> 00:35:07,844
I must restrain my thoughts and do
something altogether more constructive.

423
00:35:07,887 --> 00:35:09,798
What is the matter, sir?

424
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:13,402
I have done the one thing
forbidden by the King:

425
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:16,206
I have fallen in love
with my wife.

426
00:35:32,607 --> 00:35:35,599
Merivel, there is
someone to see you.

427
00:35:35,687 --> 00:35:38,440
This is Mr. Finn,
a painter.

428
00:35:39,767 --> 00:35:41,723
A painter?

429
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,321
A painter! Welcome!

430
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:47,837
A painter! Most excellent.

431
00:35:47,887 --> 00:35:49,843
- Did I send for a painter?
- No, sir.

432
00:35:49,927 --> 00:35:53,283
Never mind.
I'm a keen painter myself.

433
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:07,446
I call it
"Le Matin de Merivel I'Automne."

434
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:12,800
What do you make of it,
honestly?

435
00:36:14,527 --> 00:36:17,280
It is an excrescence.

436
00:36:17,327 --> 00:36:20,922
Ah! Perhaps that is
the word for it.

437
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:24,039
But to me it's a rather
memorable rendering...

438
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:27,603
of all the colors
I have in my park.

439
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:29,882
You must not show
this painting to anyone.

440
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:32,162
- You must, I think, burn it.
- Oh.

441
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:34,477
Merivel, Mr. Finn has arrived
with a commission.

442
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,206
A commission!
From whom?

443
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:41,116
Robin Hood?

444
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:45,280
Robin Hood? Oh, yes.
My Lincoln green.

445
00:36:45,327 --> 00:36:47,682
How funny.

446
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:50,560
Now, if I may,
this letter commands...

447
00:36:50,607 --> 00:36:53,075
the following commission
by one Elias Finn, myself,

448
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:56,039
a noble and beautiful
portrait of Lady Merivel.

449
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,921
"An excellent painting will earn
Mr. Finn a small place at court."

450
00:37:00,007 --> 00:37:02,760
So, you see,
not Robin Hood... the King.

451
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:04,678
Shall we go?

452
00:37:06,087 --> 00:37:09,602
My imprisonment is over.
The King means me to return.

453
00:37:19,167 --> 00:37:21,078
- Aw, cherubs.
- Uh-huh.

454
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,398
The King has often told me
he cannot abide the cherub.

455
00:37:24,487 --> 00:37:27,399
I would not depend upon this
for your future, either of you.

456
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:30,325
- Why not, Merivel?
- It is a commission from the King.

457
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,597
My dear Flinn...
No, Finch...

458
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:35,406
- Uh, "Finn".
- Oh.

459
00:37:35,487 --> 00:37:38,843
Many portraits are
commissioned by the King,

460
00:37:38,927 --> 00:37:41,964
and most of the poor artists
are still waiting to be paid.

461
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:45,317
Yes, well, we shall have to make the
painting too beautiful to be resisted.

462
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:48,643
And, Celia, there seems to be
no mention of your returning to court.

463
00:37:48,687 --> 00:37:52,123
- But why else would he ask for a portrait?
- Souvenir, perhaps.

464
00:37:52,207 --> 00:37:54,357
A letter, Sir Robert.

465
00:37:54,407 --> 00:37:56,284
Mmm.

466
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:01,084
From the King.

467
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,117
If I may!
If I may!

468
00:38:05,247 --> 00:38:08,045
What mention does the King
make of the painting in his letter?

469
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,436
Oh, it's... None.

470
00:38:10,487 --> 00:38:13,320
I would frame some message to him,
but I don't know what to say.

471
00:38:13,367 --> 00:38:16,837
Celia, if I do not set sail now,
I shall not reach London by morning.

472
00:38:16,887 --> 00:38:21,005
And we both know the King regards a
betrayal of time as a betrayal of faith.

473
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:53,957
...there is a void...

474
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,644
Ah, Merivel.
Is it you?

475
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:13,247
It is me.

476
00:39:13,287 --> 00:39:16,120
It-It is in fact I, Sire.

477
00:39:30,087 --> 00:39:32,157
Time has changed you,
Merivel.

478
00:39:32,247 --> 00:39:37,002
As with many of my people, some
vital part of you appears to be asleep.

479
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:44,596
Something has arrived,
Merivel.

480
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:47,485
Something that may rouse
even you from sleep.

481
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:52,396
The plague.
La peste.

482
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:56,400
Deptford, four people
have died. It will spread.

483
00:39:56,487 --> 00:39:59,718
Some of us will be spared
and some will die.

484
00:39:59,767 --> 00:40:02,565
But all of us will awake.

485
00:40:10,887 --> 00:40:14,038
Come along, Merivel.
There is much to discuss.

486
00:40:14,127 --> 00:40:17,164
You see, I have started work
upon this toad.

487
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:19,397
- Ah.
- Will you help me to dissect it?

488
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:21,517
Yes, if you
wish me to, Sire.

489
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:24,081
Yes, I do wish you to,
Merivel.

490
00:40:24,127 --> 00:40:28,564
I have summoned you
to talk about your wife.

491
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:32,526
Pin, Merivel.

492
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:36,960
When I married her to you,
it was to hide her...

493
00:40:37,047 --> 00:40:41,962
from the intelligent gaze
of my mistress, Lady Castlemaine.

494
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:47,958
Now, observe the sheen of the gut.
It's like a jewel.

495
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:53,360
You may imagine, then, my fury
when she commanded me...

496
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:56,080
to end my liaison
with Lady Castlemaine...

497
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:59,079
and likewise
to terminate my amours...

498
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:02,603
with certain actresses
of the playhouse.

499
00:41:04,447 --> 00:41:07,519
So I banished her
to Suffolk.

500
00:41:07,607 --> 00:41:10,075
Now the grosser part of me...

501
00:41:10,207 --> 00:41:13,199
is uncommonly sensible
to her absence.

502
00:41:13,287 --> 00:41:17,041
The royal tool is waving about
in search of her.

503
00:41:18,367 --> 00:41:22,326
She is skillful and enthusiastic
in these matters.

504
00:41:23,887 --> 00:41:27,641
Merivel, I desire you
to impress upon Celia...

505
00:41:27,727 --> 00:41:31,083
to be content
with what she has.

506
00:41:31,127 --> 00:41:34,597
Tell her to come to me in humility
and she may have it all again:

507
00:41:34,687 --> 00:41:38,885
Her house, servants, money and the King
in her bed from time to time.

508
00:41:38,967 --> 00:41:42,004
I desire her
penitent return...

509
00:41:42,087 --> 00:41:44,317
when the portrait
is finished.

510
00:41:44,407 --> 00:41:49,083
Um... he's a slow painter,
Your Majesty, what with all the cherubs.

511
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:51,920
What is a painting
without cherubs? Hmm?

512
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,923
Precisely, Sire.

513
00:41:54,007 --> 00:41:55,918
Make this clear, Merivel:

514
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:00,040
I expect her in my bed
when the portrait is complete.

515
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:06,517
The King would give no promise
whatsoever with regard to you.

516
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,643
But he must
have said something.

517
00:42:08,687 --> 00:42:10,882
He desired that you
stay here at Bidnold...

518
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:13,999
until you became aware
of the changeful nature of all things.

519
00:42:15,607 --> 00:42:17,757
But how long does he say
this will take?

520
00:42:17,887 --> 00:42:20,242
Months? Years?

521
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:23,160
Am I to grow old
and see my beauty vanish...

522
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,880
and all that once pleased him
turn to decay?

523
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:28,401
I'm sure he does not
intend that,

524
00:42:28,487 --> 00:42:31,126
but he has put the matter
into your hands and into mine.

525
00:42:31,207 --> 00:42:33,198
Into your hands?

526
00:42:33,247 --> 00:42:35,078
Yes.

527
00:42:35,167 --> 00:42:38,318
For I am to judge
when you are ready.

528
00:42:38,407 --> 00:42:41,843
And the King has promised to correspond
with me regularly over the matter.

529
00:42:41,927 --> 00:42:44,395
And how shall I arrive
at this wisdom?

530
00:42:44,487 --> 00:42:46,717
He has suggested, perhaps,
that we together...

531
00:42:46,847 --> 00:42:49,236
exercise our gifts
for music.

532
00:42:56,607 --> 00:42:59,565
- Just arrived, sir.
- Will, I need you to do something for me.

533
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:03,486
- Anything, sir. - You must
forge a letter to me from the King.

534
00:43:03,567 --> 00:43:06,035
Sir.

535
00:43:07,287 --> 00:43:10,597
And, uh, the King makes
no mention of a date...

536
00:43:10,647 --> 00:43:13,719
for me to have, uh,
completed the painting?

537
00:43:13,767 --> 00:43:15,803
- My dear Finch.
- "Finn."

538
00:43:15,847 --> 00:43:17,758
Ah!

539
00:43:17,807 --> 00:43:21,197
He has no interest, it seems,
in the painting whatsoever...

540
00:43:21,287 --> 00:43:24,518
but for his continued
suspicion of cherubs.

541
00:43:24,607 --> 00:43:26,962
So it seems to me
that it is to music...

542
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:29,322
that His Majesty owes
his greatest affection.

543
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,126
- We are all mere pawns.
- Mmm! Prawns, yes.

544
00:43:32,207 --> 00:43:35,005
No, no, "pawns."
"Pawns"!

545
00:43:40,127 --> 00:43:42,004
Hmm.

546
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:50,360
Merivel, wake up.
There is something I must tell you.

547
00:43:50,447 --> 00:43:52,597
Celia!

548
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:54,564
The bird is ill.

549
00:43:54,687 --> 00:43:56,678
The bird. The bird.
Oh, the bird!

550
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,280
Please, we must do something.

551
00:43:58,367 --> 00:44:00,562
Birds are not really
my specialty...

552
00:44:00,607 --> 00:44:02,484
But, Merivel,
it is dying!

553
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:14,444
Merivel, why are you
no longer a physician?

554
00:44:15,727 --> 00:44:17,080
Um...

555
00:44:17,167 --> 00:44:20,239
When I asked the King why
he was marrying me to such a fool,

556
00:44:20,327 --> 00:44:23,205
he said that you had
a great gift for healing.

557
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:29,883
Perhaps I should stay.
We should watch over the bird together.

558
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,401
Yes, I would like that.

559
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:57,884
It's dead.

560
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:19,876
Are you not putting
yourself at terrible risk, sir?

561
00:45:19,927 --> 00:45:23,044
Forging the King's seal
is a hanging offense.

562
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:25,521
I love her, Will.
I must do all I can...

563
00:45:25,607 --> 00:45:28,041
to discourage
completion of the portrait.

564
00:45:33,087 --> 00:45:35,123
Sir Robert?

565
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,362
I'm sure your wife
is greatly dismayed...

566
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,477
at the loss
of her favorite bird.

567
00:45:39,567 --> 00:45:41,398
Inconsolable, I fear.

568
00:45:41,487 --> 00:45:43,921
Which must, in turn,
cause you much distress.

569
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:46,919
Of course.
I did all that I could.

570
00:45:47,007 --> 00:45:49,805
Sir Robert, now that the painting
is nearly complete,

571
00:45:49,887 --> 00:45:53,436
I feel it is my duty to thank you for
your hospitality during my stay here.

572
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:56,160
Th-Th-The desire
to finish the work...

573
00:45:56,207 --> 00:45:58,596
has perhaps made me
less than an ideal guest.

574
00:45:58,727 --> 00:46:01,161
- For that I am sorry.
- No, matter, Finn. No matter.

575
00:46:01,287 --> 00:46:04,120
I understand better than
most the lure of court.

576
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:06,203
- Sir Robert.
- Hmm?

577
00:46:06,287 --> 00:46:08,676
May I be forward with you?

578
00:46:08,767 --> 00:46:11,520
During my stay here,
I-I've noticed...

579
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,757
that a certain bond
has formed...

580
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:16,884
between yourself
and Lady Merivel.

581
00:46:16,927 --> 00:46:19,487
A-And that you are perhaps...

582
00:46:19,567 --> 00:46:22,240
although she has warmed
considerably...

583
00:46:22,287 --> 00:46:24,801
unsure how to further
the matter.

584
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:30,166
Perhaps i-i-i-if I were
to broach the subject with her,

585
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:34,035
her natural shyness
might find some release?

586
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:39,156
My God, it's a most
delicate situation.

587
00:46:39,207 --> 00:46:41,516
But that might be
the very thing.

588
00:46:41,607 --> 00:46:45,202
I think. Well, I'll do what I can.

589
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:50,436
I will, of course,
act most subtly.

590
00:47:09,527 --> 00:47:11,358
Merivel!

591
00:47:13,007 --> 00:47:15,760
I have spoken to Lady Celia,
and my impression is...

592
00:47:15,847 --> 00:47:18,645
that your advances
would not be unwelcome.

593
00:47:51,127 --> 00:47:55,598
Voila! Venus!
Uncommonly bright!

594
00:47:55,687 --> 00:47:59,726
A good portent. Venus being the
brightest of all the evening stars...

595
00:47:59,807 --> 00:48:02,446
and the reigning planet
of earthly love.

596
00:48:02,527 --> 00:48:04,438
Come and look.

597
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:11,121
Uh, uh...
Here. Here.

598
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,358
Ah.

599
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,878
- You're right, Merivel. It really
is a beautiful star. - Yes.

600
00:48:19,927 --> 00:48:22,964
And it smiles on us
from on high.

601
00:48:24,727 --> 00:48:26,558
We are blessed.

602
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:54,558
Merivel?

603
00:48:55,727 --> 00:48:58,161
Merivel!

604
00:48:58,247 --> 00:49:00,522
No!

605
00:49:00,567 --> 00:49:03,240
No! No!

606
00:49:06,647 --> 00:49:08,956
Celia, you must think
no more of the King.

607
00:49:09,047 --> 00:49:12,164
If he is not weary of you now,
he soon will be.

608
00:49:14,207 --> 00:49:17,165
- You're wrong, Merivel.
The King wants me back.

609
00:49:17,247 --> 00:49:21,638
Do you think he will curtail his amours
with the actresses of the playhouse? Never.

610
00:49:21,687 --> 00:49:25,839
He is a loose fish!
He cannot be held or kept.

611
00:49:25,927 --> 00:49:30,921
I am your husband, and all that I ask
is that you allow me to love you.

612
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:06,642
It just arrived
from the palace, sir.

613
00:50:08,807 --> 00:50:10,718
Mr. Finn
has betrayed us.

614
00:50:10,807 --> 00:50:13,765
I-I shall leave for
court in the morning.

615
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:20,560
And, Will, pack
one of our pineapples.

616
00:50:20,647 --> 00:50:23,286
I shall take it
as a gift to the King,

617
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:25,921
though I fear that...

618
00:50:26,007 --> 00:50:27,884
What, sir?

619
00:50:27,927 --> 00:50:30,600
That no offering of this
kind will be enough.

620
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:44,442
Ah, Merivel!

621
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:50,883
This is my new plan
for our native city, Merivel.

622
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:53,401
Yes, come along, Merivel.

623
00:50:53,527 --> 00:50:56,246
See how Fleet Street
is thus straightened.

624
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:59,563
And there is here one straight view
from Ludgate Circus...

625
00:50:59,607 --> 00:51:02,360
past St. Paul's
and on to the Royal Exchange.

626
00:51:02,447 --> 00:51:06,440
And here's another street from, uh...
from Smithfield down to the river...

627
00:51:06,527 --> 00:51:08,995
where, perhaps, the halls
of the lesser companies...

628
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:11,726
might be built
along Thames Quay.

629
00:51:13,727 --> 00:51:18,198
All for the beauty, ornament
and convenience of the city.

630
00:51:18,247 --> 00:51:20,203
Sit down, Merivel.

631
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:22,158
Ohh!

632
00:51:23,527 --> 00:51:26,087
I-It is a brave
new plan, Sire.

633
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,998
Now, I have...

634
00:51:28,087 --> 00:51:31,796
Do you remember we once
made a plan together, Merivel?

635
00:51:31,887 --> 00:51:34,765
And in that plan,
love was not asked of you.

636
00:51:34,807 --> 00:51:38,356
Indeed, it was the only thing
specifically forbidden of you.

637
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:41,007
By ignoring what we agreed,

638
00:51:41,047 --> 00:51:44,278
you have driven yourself
out of paradise.

639
00:51:45,447 --> 00:51:47,358
Out of paradise?

640
00:51:47,407 --> 00:51:49,716
Well, yes.
For what is your role now?

641
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:54,119
I had not intended to love Celia.
I do not know how it happened.

642
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:56,926
It happened because
you allowed it to happen.

643
00:51:57,007 --> 00:52:00,317
By trying to be the thing that you were
charged with pretending to be,

644
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:03,245
you have rendered yourself
useless to me.

645
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,279
I'm taking Bidnold from you.

646
00:52:11,727 --> 00:52:14,082
What'll I do?

647
00:52:14,127 --> 00:52:17,437
Hmm. What did you do before?

648
00:52:17,487 --> 00:52:21,116
I was... I worked
as a physician.

649
00:52:21,207 --> 00:52:23,596
Ah, yes.
In the hospital.

650
00:52:23,687 --> 00:52:26,247
Well, you can use
that skill again.

651
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:30,121
- I cannot!
- Why not, Merivel?

652
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,277
Because I'm afraid.

653
00:52:34,327 --> 00:52:38,605
Precisely.
So, au revoir, Merivel.

654
00:52:38,647 --> 00:52:42,117
I shall not say adieu,
for who knows,

655
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:45,961
perhaps in the future, history may have
another role for you.

656
00:52:47,287 --> 00:52:50,518
Your Majesty, you took me
from the Royal College,

657
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:55,038
gave me your dogs to look after,
liked me for my foolishness.

658
00:52:55,127 --> 00:52:57,038
No, Merivel.

659
00:52:59,167 --> 00:53:01,362
I liked you for your skill,

660
00:53:01,407 --> 00:53:03,762
for then the two were in you...
light and dark.

661
00:53:03,807 --> 00:53:06,162
But now, your skill
is fallen away...

662
00:53:06,247 --> 00:53:09,796
and you are one foolish,
quivering mass.

663
00:53:12,887 --> 00:53:15,162
The plague is coming,
Merivel,

664
00:53:15,247 --> 00:53:18,398
and the plague rouses men
from their sleep.

665
00:53:44,447 --> 00:53:46,915
You know, Will,
in my time at Bidnold...

666
00:53:47,007 --> 00:53:50,477
I have grown
uncommonly fond of you.

667
00:53:50,567 --> 00:53:55,083
And I... if I may say so, sir...
am uncommonly fond of you.

668
00:53:55,167 --> 00:53:59,001
So you're off to Mr. Pearce
and the Quakers, sir?

669
00:53:59,087 --> 00:54:01,203
I've nowhere else to go.

670
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:36,605
Ah! How may I
help you, friend?

671
00:54:36,687 --> 00:54:39,520
I-I've come to visit
my friend, Pearce.

672
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:42,207
You must be Robert.

673
00:54:42,287 --> 00:54:44,198
Please, enter.

674
00:54:49,127 --> 00:54:50,958
Daniel!

675
00:54:51,047 --> 00:54:55,120
Ah, John told us one day
you would like to join us.

676
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:58,677
- Ah, did he?
- Get some oats for the horse.

677
00:54:58,727 --> 00:55:00,763
I do not intend
staying long.

678
00:55:00,807 --> 00:55:03,480
I hate being housed up
anywhere for too long, sir.

679
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,478
Robert!

680
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,206
Robert!

681
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,847
Pearce! Pearce!

682
00:55:10,927 --> 00:55:14,044
- John.
- John?

683
00:55:14,127 --> 00:55:16,641
Here in Whittlesea,
I'm John and you're Robert.

684
00:55:16,727 --> 00:55:20,436
I'm bound, after all these years,
to find that difficult.

685
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:25,157
Come on. Let's get you out of the wet
and up to your room.

686
00:55:25,207 --> 00:55:28,563
It's the size
of one of my linen cupboards.

687
00:55:28,647 --> 00:55:31,366
Here we give prominence
to other things, Robert.

688
00:55:31,447 --> 00:55:35,156
When I saw your life before among the
terrible luxuries of the courts, I, uh...

689
00:55:35,247 --> 00:55:38,603
well, I prayed you
would be taken out of it.

690
00:55:40,607 --> 00:55:44,077
And yet I was uncommonly
fond of it, Pearce.

691
00:55:46,047 --> 00:55:48,117
This is our new
friend Robert.

692
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:50,243
This is Ambrose,

693
00:55:50,327 --> 00:55:52,238
Daniel...

694
00:55:52,287 --> 00:55:54,357
and our dear sisters,

695
00:55:54,447 --> 00:55:57,166
Hannah and Eleanor.

696
00:55:57,207 --> 00:55:59,323
Robert is well qualified
to help us.

697
00:55:59,407 --> 00:56:02,399
He claims to have forgotten
medicine, but I know he has not.

698
00:56:02,487 --> 00:56:04,921
- I have. Sadly, I have.
- Not.

699
00:56:04,967 --> 00:56:07,435
- Well, regrettably, but in fact...
- Stop it.

700
00:56:07,527 --> 00:56:11,600
Lord, send a light
to show Robert the way.

701
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:15,242
Dear Jesus, be with Robert.

702
00:56:15,327 --> 00:56:18,763
God in heaven,
take Robert's hand.

703
00:56:18,807 --> 00:56:20,923
Be at his side.

704
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:24,283
And even when night comes,
still be at his side.

705
00:56:24,367 --> 00:56:26,801
Amen.

706
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:31,403
The inmates are looked after
in a series of barns.

707
00:56:31,447 --> 00:56:33,597
This is the men's barn.

708
00:56:33,647 --> 00:56:37,401
And in the women's barn, the
invalid friends weave sailcloth.

709
00:56:42,527 --> 00:56:44,995
The keepers must never
enter the barns alone.

710
00:56:45,087 --> 00:56:47,396
Yes, I certainly
understand.

711
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,523
This is alarming.

712
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:51,518
This is our work now.

713
00:56:51,607 --> 00:56:54,167
But how has madness
undone so many?

714
00:56:54,247 --> 00:56:56,158
By a hundred different ways.

715
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:58,397
Madness is a brother
and sister to misfortune.

716
00:56:58,447 --> 00:57:01,200
Poverty and abandonment
are prime causes.

717
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:05,166
This is Robert!
He's come to help us in our work.

718
00:57:05,247 --> 00:57:07,363
Say the name to yourselves...

719
00:57:07,407 --> 00:57:10,717
and keep it precious
because he is your friend.

720
00:57:10,807 --> 00:57:12,638
- Robert.
- Robert.

721
00:57:12,727 --> 00:57:16,322
We have one here, a young
Irish woman... Katharine.

722
00:57:16,407 --> 00:57:19,956
She was abandoned one night
by her husband.

723
00:57:20,007 --> 00:57:22,237
And now,
she will not sleep.

724
00:57:22,327 --> 00:57:24,887
Are you another man
sent to do me injustice?

725
00:57:26,327 --> 00:57:29,876
Katharine, this is our new friend
Robert. He won't hurt you.

726
00:57:37,847 --> 00:57:42,318
Red may now, having passed under
the hoop, endeavor to roquet black.

727
00:57:42,407 --> 00:57:45,240
May we not play
a little croquet here, Robert?

728
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:48,438
Um. No. No. The sight
of a croquet hoop...

729
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:52,446
would produce in John
a most extraordinary reaction.

730
00:57:53,687 --> 00:57:55,598
What is she doing?

731
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:57,723
She calls it her leaving step.

732
00:58:03,727 --> 00:58:05,604
That's some kind of dance?

733
00:58:07,767 --> 00:58:09,598
- Hello, Robert.
- Hello.

734
00:58:12,007 --> 00:58:15,238
Every man on earth
has his leaving step.

735
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:18,245
If my husband had been
a small man,

736
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:20,198
he would not have been
able to leave.

737
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:24,166
He was a large man.
Stepped over me as I slept,

738
00:58:24,247 --> 00:58:27,045
in one giant stride.

739
00:58:29,607 --> 00:58:34,078
The king, too, being plagued by fools
from whom he wishes to walk away,

740
00:58:34,127 --> 00:58:37,756
has perfected his leaving step
to a walk of unsurpassed elegance.

741
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:42,476
Show me then that walk.

742
00:58:44,807 --> 00:58:47,196
Um...

743
00:58:47,287 --> 00:58:49,118
Well, sort of...

744
00:58:53,247 --> 00:58:55,124
Uh... I cannot.

745
00:58:55,167 --> 00:58:58,603
My imitation is too poor.
The shoes are all wrong and, uh...

746
00:58:58,647 --> 00:59:02,322
But you, too, are a man.
Have you not your own leaving step?

747
00:59:02,367 --> 00:59:05,165
No. It is others
who leave me.

748
00:59:10,127 --> 00:59:14,405
Lunacy is a devilish liquid thing.

749
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:19,766
It can only be coaxed out
by blood, vomit or feces.

750
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:22,441
Do you not smell
the choler?

751
00:59:22,527 --> 00:59:24,483
See. She's quiet now.

752
00:59:24,607 --> 00:59:27,565
Of course. She's lost
a lot of blood.

753
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:35,601
Do you honestly believe that
the bleeding is necessary?

754
00:59:35,687 --> 00:59:38,201
I hope to make her sleep.
Sleep is the best thing for her.

755
00:59:38,287 --> 00:59:40,118
Is there not
some other way?

756
00:59:40,207 --> 00:59:42,596
Robert, you've not seen
the nature of her madness.

757
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:45,844
She marches up and down at night,
shouting and crying.

758
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:49,283
- What does she shout?
- That she is not mad.

759
00:59:49,327 --> 00:59:51,397
Perhaps she is not mad.

760
00:59:51,527 --> 00:59:54,837
On two occasions she tried
to take her own life.

761
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:57,083
Mightn't that be despair?

762
00:59:57,127 --> 01:00:00,881
What you and I would feel
were we locked away with the mad.

763
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,036
Why do you tear
your clothes?

764
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,759
I'm making windows
for my limbs to see through.

765
01:00:12,847 --> 01:00:16,317
Clothes make me blind and I must
be watchful at all times,

766
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:19,040
lest someone come
to hurt me again.

767
01:00:19,127 --> 01:00:22,597
This is for you.
The robe of sleep.

768
01:00:22,727 --> 01:00:26,003
To comfort you,
as you comfort your doll.

769
01:00:26,047 --> 01:00:28,641
Robert.

770
01:00:28,727 --> 01:00:30,797
I shall be along shortly.

771
01:00:46,767 --> 01:00:48,723
Why are you afraid
to sleep?

772
01:00:51,607 --> 01:00:54,599
Once I fell asleep,

773
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:56,877
but the evil in me was wakeful.

774
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,844
And I let slip my little girl.

775
01:00:58,887 --> 01:01:01,276
Your daughter?

776
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:08,759
My man was an English soldier.
One of Cromwell's.

777
01:01:08,847 --> 01:01:13,079
He was good to my family.

778
01:01:13,167 --> 01:01:15,601
And I was green as a goose.

779
01:01:15,687 --> 01:01:18,599
And fair looking.

780
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,198
It was he who took
you to London?

781
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,481
A little girl was born to us and lived
three years before she was taken.

782
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:32,676
She liked to see the boats.

783
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:38,602
We watched the river
and the river watched us...

784
01:01:38,647 --> 01:01:41,798
until one day
I closed my eyes...

785
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:44,680
and the river took her
for drownin'.

786
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,517
You must be watchful
always, Robert.

787
01:01:50,127 --> 01:01:53,005
Do not sleep.

788
01:01:53,087 --> 01:01:56,284
We will be watchful
for each other.

789
01:01:56,327 --> 01:01:58,557
You can sleep.
I will take the first watch.

790
01:02:00,687 --> 01:02:02,518
I cannot.

791
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:18,957
Across the sea,
in the Land of Mar...

792
01:02:19,047 --> 01:02:22,960
there is a valley where are kept
all the things lost on earth.

793
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:28,885
Lost kingdoms,
lost riches,

794
01:02:28,967 --> 01:02:32,084
lost hours,
lost loves.

795
01:02:33,607 --> 01:02:37,043
The people go there to discover
their lost days and lost deeds.

796
01:02:45,047 --> 01:02:48,881
And often they are surprised
to come across a few of their lost wits.

797
01:02:51,087 --> 01:02:54,284
Simply because they'd never
in the least missed them.

798
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:11,436
Robert, if you're seen to be
overattentive to one,

799
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,479
you'll be seen to be less than attentive
to the others.

800
01:03:14,527 --> 01:03:17,121
I helped her to sleep.
So perhaps I was near a cure for her.

801
01:03:17,207 --> 01:03:18,959
That is somewhat arrogant.

802
01:03:19,047 --> 01:03:22,323
Cures are not performed by us.
Only Jesus cures.

803
01:03:22,407 --> 01:03:24,238
We are merely His agents.

804
01:03:24,327 --> 01:03:27,399
But may we not, as His agents,
look to ourselves?

805
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,240
To our own experience
to aid in a cure?

806
01:03:32,327 --> 01:03:35,285
When I am ill,
I will seek out...

807
01:03:35,367 --> 01:03:37,722
at the first sign or footstep
of that illness...

808
01:03:37,807 --> 01:03:41,686
the services of a physician
to help me to a cure.

809
01:03:41,767 --> 01:03:43,917
And the insane man,
on the contrary,

810
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:47,482
is not brought to any bedlam or
hospital until the disease is far advanced.

811
01:03:50,407 --> 01:03:53,797
For all our inmates
there was a time before.

812
01:03:53,887 --> 01:03:55,764
When there was
no madness in them.

813
01:03:55,847 --> 01:04:00,204
We should try to ask each
one of those in our care...

814
01:04:00,247 --> 01:04:03,319
to try to remember how it was
to be in the time before.

815
01:04:03,367 --> 01:04:05,517
And to return them there.

816
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:08,838
Perhaps as sleep returns
Katharine to her time before,

817
01:04:08,927 --> 01:04:10,838
in times of joy,

818
01:04:10,967 --> 01:04:16,121
and in this way
we might discover...

819
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:19,324
the imprint of the steps
to madness.

820
01:04:19,407 --> 01:04:22,956
There, just
under the surface,

821
01:04:23,007 --> 01:04:26,317
there could be cures
by dancing and laughter.

822
01:04:26,407 --> 01:04:28,238
I see Daniel playing
a tarantella.

823
01:04:28,327 --> 01:04:30,158
I see the women dancing
like happy children.

824
01:04:30,247 --> 01:04:33,045
I see... I see...

825
01:04:36,327 --> 01:04:39,285
all the things lost on earth.

826
01:04:39,367 --> 01:04:41,403
Robert!

827
01:04:41,487 --> 01:04:43,443
This is not
the Court Masque.

828
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:45,836
I know that!

829
01:04:48,567 --> 01:04:51,764
But you cannot banish joy,
for that is the road to madness.

830
01:04:51,847 --> 01:04:54,759
And, and all this...

831
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,843
has come to me
from the Lord...

832
01:04:59,007 --> 01:05:00,838
I suspect.

833
01:05:05,767 --> 01:05:09,362
Today, instead of walking round
the tree, we're gonna dance.

834
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:12,996
Or skip. Or gallop.
Anything.

835
01:05:13,087 --> 01:05:16,284
And your keepers
will dance with you.

836
01:05:18,687 --> 01:05:21,599
Um, this is
a twirling dance...

837
01:05:21,687 --> 01:05:25,236
so why do you not twirl
and turn and dance?

838
01:05:49,447 --> 01:05:51,324
Hello, Robert.

839
01:06:15,127 --> 01:06:17,766
One, two and three and four.

840
01:06:25,607 --> 01:06:27,438
Yes! Yes!

841
01:06:27,527 --> 01:06:29,518
Ha ha!

842
01:06:43,607 --> 01:06:46,838
- Dance with me!
- Oh, I cannot.

843
01:06:46,927 --> 01:06:49,043
Robert cannot, for he is the music.

844
01:06:49,127 --> 01:06:51,322
Perhaps, uh, John will ask you
to dance with him.

845
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,158
Come on!

846
01:07:21,647 --> 01:07:23,717
Why was this music
not always with us?

847
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:33,324
Aha!

848
01:07:44,967 --> 01:07:46,844
John?

849
01:07:51,847 --> 01:07:53,724
John?

850
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:55,962
John.

851
01:07:57,767 --> 01:07:59,644
Robert.

852
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:02,963
For a month now,

853
01:08:03,007 --> 01:08:06,158
and I'm telling this
to you and nobody else,

854
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:08,602
I've felt certain symptoms
come upon me.

855
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,364
First, you must rest.

856
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:15,278
Only then, Pearce,
can I prescribe my remedy.

857
01:08:15,367 --> 01:08:17,198
- John.
- Ah, John, then,

858
01:08:17,287 --> 01:08:19,881
but you'll be neither one nor the other
if you allow yourself to die.

859
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:21,878
I cannot stay in bed,
there's so much work to do...

860
01:08:21,927 --> 01:08:23,838
Please do not make me
lose my temper!

861
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,800
Have I not a hundred times since
we've met allowed you to command me...

862
01:08:26,887 --> 01:08:28,764
and done this or that
thing at your bidding?

863
01:08:28,807 --> 01:08:31,082
I have. So do not even consider
contradicting me!

864
01:08:40,447 --> 01:08:42,278
What do you prescribe?

865
01:08:45,927 --> 01:08:49,715
Syrup of roses to warm your blood
and soothe your coughing.

866
01:08:49,767 --> 01:08:52,122
A burdock poultice
for your head.

867
01:08:52,167 --> 01:08:55,842
- And for the slime in the lung?
- Sal ammoniac.

868
01:08:55,927 --> 01:08:57,758
And a balsam.

869
01:08:57,847 --> 01:09:01,965
Yes, we shall try several dissolved
in boiling water and inhaled.

870
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:06,563
It's all come back
to you then, Robert?

871
01:09:06,647 --> 01:09:09,445
The right knowledge
at the right time.

872
01:09:10,607 --> 01:09:12,916
Perhaps.
We shall see.

873
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:52,525
Tell me more tales
of the Land of Mar.

874
01:09:56,967 --> 01:10:00,277
In the woods there lived
great families of badger.

875
01:10:00,407 --> 01:10:03,444
And people liked to bring
their children there to see them.

876
01:10:16,487 --> 01:10:19,763
The children are always told that if
they are very quiet, they will see them.

877
01:10:22,807 --> 01:10:24,638
As far as I know,

878
01:10:24,727 --> 01:10:27,036
they are never quiet enough.

879
01:11:01,447 --> 01:11:04,200
This shall be
our meeting place.

880
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:07,165
Yes.

881
01:11:07,207 --> 01:11:09,084
And I'll wait for ya.

882
01:11:14,167 --> 01:11:17,045
And you'll come to me.

883
01:11:17,127 --> 01:11:18,958
I will.

884
01:11:38,567 --> 01:11:41,035
Merivel?

885
01:11:43,087 --> 01:11:44,918
Why had you go out?

886
01:11:45,007 --> 01:11:47,646
Oh, when I cannot sleep,
sometimes I walk...

887
01:11:47,727 --> 01:11:49,558
in the air at night.

888
01:11:51,367 --> 01:11:53,198
Let's see.

889
01:11:59,567 --> 01:12:01,398
Hmm.

890
01:12:01,447 --> 01:12:03,324
You're burning up.

891
01:12:07,687 --> 01:12:09,518
You called me Merivel.

892
01:12:11,247 --> 01:12:14,762
Since this fever I've...

893
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:17,600
I've forgotten
your other name.

894
01:12:17,687 --> 01:12:19,518
Robert.

895
01:12:19,607 --> 01:12:21,916
Robert. That's it.

896
01:12:27,127 --> 01:12:29,960
What I do remember is...

897
01:12:30,007 --> 01:12:33,716
how I witnessed
the beating heart.

898
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:35,644
Yes, I remember.

899
01:12:37,007 --> 01:12:40,204
You put your hand in
and touched it, but I could not.

900
01:12:41,247 --> 01:12:43,477
I remember.

901
01:12:45,727 --> 01:12:48,036
And yet the man
felt nothing.

902
01:12:49,207 --> 01:12:51,038
No, he felt nothing.

903
01:12:55,567 --> 01:12:58,843
Pray for me that I might become
that man and feel no pain.

904
01:13:00,167 --> 01:13:02,761
I shall.

905
01:13:10,967 --> 01:13:13,037
It is not
the plague then?

906
01:13:13,127 --> 01:13:16,597
No. It's his lung.
A potent consumption.

907
01:13:16,687 --> 01:13:20,566
Let us pray for our friend John
in his time of trouble...

908
01:13:20,647 --> 01:13:23,719
that his pain
may be the less.

909
01:13:41,127 --> 01:13:42,958
Stay with me.

910
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:48,924
The pain is less
when you stay with me.

911
01:13:57,127 --> 01:13:58,958
Blessed be the name of the Lord...

912
01:13:59,047 --> 01:14:02,005
from this time forth
and forever more.

913
01:14:02,087 --> 01:14:04,043
From the rising
of the sun...

914
01:14:04,087 --> 01:14:06,362
and the going down
of the same,

915
01:14:06,447 --> 01:14:09,644
the Lord's name
is to be praised.

916
01:14:09,727 --> 01:14:14,721
It troubles me to take with me
to my grave so much that I do not know.

917
01:14:14,807 --> 01:14:18,516
I'd rather you did not talk
about the grave, John.

918
01:14:18,607 --> 01:14:21,405
Of course you would.

919
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:23,842
There are many matters,
ever since I met you,

920
01:14:23,927 --> 01:14:27,681
upon which you would prefer me
to remain silent.

921
01:14:28,887 --> 01:14:30,718
But it has
never been my way.

922
01:14:37,007 --> 01:14:38,838
Here.

923
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:46,727
Your copy of Harvey.

924
01:14:46,847 --> 01:14:50,283
You have a gift,
Merivel. Use it.

925
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:52,597
Robert!

926
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:56,597
Robert!

927
01:14:56,687 --> 01:14:59,918
Robert!

928
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:01,923
Robert!

929
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:07,286
Robert is my lover!

930
01:15:07,367 --> 01:15:09,198
Robert!

931
01:15:09,287 --> 01:15:12,836
He is my lover!

932
01:15:12,927 --> 01:15:15,805
Robert!

933
01:15:15,847 --> 01:15:17,758
Robert!

934
01:15:20,887 --> 01:15:23,606
He is my lover!

935
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:34,886
Farewell, my friend.

936
01:15:52,967 --> 01:15:57,757
When the time is right,
Robert shall leave us.

937
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,843
And he will take
Katharine with him.

938
01:15:59,927 --> 01:16:01,758
Why?

939
01:16:01,847 --> 01:16:04,645
Because, Daniel,
she is carrying his child.

940
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:19,921
- Good-bye, Hannah.
- Good-bye, Robert.

941
01:16:20,007 --> 01:16:22,567
- Good-bye, Ambrose.
- Good-bye, Robert.

942
01:16:24,527 --> 01:16:26,358
Walk on.

943
01:16:41,327 --> 01:16:44,160
He will never teach
me croquet now.

944
01:16:52,327 --> 01:16:55,683
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

945
01:16:55,807 --> 01:16:59,561
To see a fine lady
ride on her white horse

946
01:16:59,647 --> 01:17:03,401
With rings on her fingers
and bells on her toes

947
01:17:03,487 --> 01:17:05,364
And she shall have
music wherever...

948
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,602
Are you content now?

949
01:17:07,687 --> 01:17:10,042
Why should I not be?

950
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:12,925
Will you be Quakerish
all the way to London?

951
01:17:15,967 --> 01:17:18,401
You know, in Ireland,
a man with a horse, a cart,

952
01:17:18,447 --> 01:17:21,564
and a book he knows how to read
is the catch of the county.

953
01:17:21,607 --> 01:17:23,757
Well, perhaps when we have
made fire of the cart,

954
01:17:23,847 --> 01:17:26,725
and eaten the horse,
wiped our asses with the book,

955
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:29,645
you'll have become acquainted
with what you have caught.

956
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:42,238
Oy! Hop it!

957
01:17:42,327 --> 01:17:44,841
Find the lady.

958
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:48,715
She's here, she's there,
you seek her everywhere.

959
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:51,082
She's floating in the air.

960
01:17:51,127 --> 01:17:53,436
Where is she?
Find the lady.

961
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:00,238
That was my sixpence
if I had played.

962
01:18:00,287 --> 01:18:03,757
- Here is our chance of money.
- Here's your chance

963
01:18:03,847 --> 01:18:06,281
- to be shorn like a sheep.
- Ho, fellow!

964
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:08,323
Move on or you'll
lose your breeches.

965
01:18:08,407 --> 01:18:12,036
Thank you, but I'm not one
of your bog- dwelling Irish bumpkins.

966
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,726
I have had some traffic
with the affairs of men.

967
01:18:14,807 --> 01:18:16,684
We must have money.

968
01:18:16,767 --> 01:18:19,884
There's money
inside my skirt.

969
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:21,838
Sarah!

970
01:18:21,927 --> 01:18:24,157
She is simple.

971
01:18:26,527 --> 01:18:28,358
We are doctor
and patient.

972
01:18:30,767 --> 01:18:32,837
I am the doctor.

973
01:18:32,927 --> 01:18:34,804
Show me the cards.

974
01:18:38,607 --> 01:18:40,404
Find the lady.

975
01:18:51,847 --> 01:18:54,566
I have lost everything.

976
01:18:54,607 --> 01:18:58,646
Not quite everything, sir.

977
01:18:58,727 --> 01:19:01,002
I cannot. That was
a gift from the King.

978
01:19:01,087 --> 01:19:04,397
Pity.

979
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:11,558
Once more.

980
01:19:13,687 --> 01:19:15,518
"Sir Robert Merivel.

981
01:19:15,607 --> 01:19:18,075
Master of Bidnold."

982
01:19:18,167 --> 01:19:20,203
- Show me the cards.

983
01:19:20,247 --> 01:19:22,966
Find the lady.

984
01:19:23,047 --> 01:19:26,323
She's here, she's there,
she's floating in the air.

985
01:19:26,407 --> 01:19:28,238
Find the lady.

986
01:19:30,887 --> 01:19:32,718
Nooo!

987
01:19:35,567 --> 01:19:38,320
Oh, I've made her mad again.

988
01:19:41,247 --> 01:19:43,397
Ah, gold!

989
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:47,878
Heavy as a hen egg
against everything he's lost.

990
01:19:47,927 --> 01:19:51,124
- And breakfast.
- She's simple.

991
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:54,279
It's gold.
Even-Stevens, then.

992
01:19:54,327 --> 01:19:56,204
And breakfast.

993
01:19:56,247 --> 01:19:58,715
Oh, shame. To rob
an idiot girl.

994
01:19:58,767 --> 01:20:00,644
That's not kind, Robert.

995
01:20:00,687 --> 01:20:02,564
Find the lady.

996
01:20:09,407 --> 01:20:11,363
No!

997
01:20:13,207 --> 01:20:15,721
Ha!

998
01:20:22,087 --> 01:20:23,918
But, how?

999
01:20:24,007 --> 01:20:26,726
Simple.

1000
01:20:28,807 --> 01:20:31,685
Ride a cockhorse to Banbury Cross

1001
01:20:31,727 --> 01:20:35,356
To see a fine lady
ride on her white horse

1002
01:20:35,447 --> 01:20:39,486
With rings on her fingers
and bells on her toes

1003
01:20:39,607 --> 01:20:43,486
She shall have music
wherever she goes

1004
01:21:33,727 --> 01:21:35,558
Hello?

1005
01:21:42,327 --> 01:21:44,158
Hello?

1006
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:46,078
Hello!

1007
01:21:55,767 --> 01:21:57,644
I once lived here.

1008
01:22:04,527 --> 01:22:06,836
Put your hand
on my belly.

1009
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:15,641
I'm frightened that something
might happen to take it away.

1010
01:22:19,127 --> 01:22:22,437
We'll build him a big strong castle
in the Land of Mar,

1011
01:22:22,527 --> 01:22:25,041
and put him in a high tower
where he will be safe.

1012
01:22:27,447 --> 01:22:30,917
Where he will feel
none of the unkindness of the world;

1013
01:22:30,967 --> 01:22:34,004
scheming, ugliness.

1014
01:22:34,087 --> 01:22:36,885
And should he pass
through the valley of lost things,

1015
01:22:36,967 --> 01:22:39,356
nothing of him
will ever be lost.

1016
01:22:41,607 --> 01:22:44,326
And we shall
call him John.

1017
01:22:45,687 --> 01:22:49,202
No one will ever be able
to take him from you.

1018
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,796
Do not enter, sir.

1019
01:23:03,487 --> 01:23:05,318
I've come looking for work.

1020
01:23:05,407 --> 01:23:07,762
I, uh, I attended the college.

1021
01:23:07,847 --> 01:23:11,078
That ward is struck, and once a ward
or a house is struck,

1022
01:23:11,127 --> 01:23:14,642
then all the people
therein are quarantined for 40 days.

1023
01:23:16,087 --> 01:23:19,045
- Both sick and well?
- Both together.

1024
01:23:19,127 --> 01:23:20,958
What happens?

1025
01:23:21,047 --> 01:23:24,517
We leave them.
Mostly they die.

1026
01:23:28,487 --> 01:23:30,318
What about the physicians?

1027
01:23:30,407 --> 01:23:33,240
All fled. Physicians have become
the men most despised.

1028
01:23:37,327 --> 01:23:39,158
Perhaps you'd
like that, sir.

1029
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:43,081
Physicians used to wear them
to purify the air against the plague.

1030
01:23:43,127 --> 01:23:45,846
Well, you can keep it.

1031
01:23:45,927 --> 01:23:49,442
The physician who wore it
comes here no more.

1032
01:23:49,487 --> 01:23:51,318
Nor does he go anywhere.

1033
01:23:51,447 --> 01:23:54,245
Nor has breath.

1034
01:24:29,447 --> 01:24:31,278
John.

1035
01:24:53,007 --> 01:24:56,522
You have a gift, Merivel. Use it.

1036
01:25:05,887 --> 01:25:07,764
For the child.

1037
01:25:13,087 --> 01:25:15,396
Why do you stay
with me?

1038
01:25:18,487 --> 01:25:22,082
Because the child has weaved
our lives together.

1039
01:25:22,127 --> 01:25:24,880
I know you don't love me
as you've loved others.

1040
01:25:27,207 --> 01:25:31,644
Um, perhaps I do not recognize
love, Katharine. I'm not a wise man.

1041
01:25:46,287 --> 01:25:48,323
In the Land of Mar,

1042
01:25:48,367 --> 01:25:51,086
which lies
just above Africa...

1043
01:25:55,047 --> 01:25:57,561
To help you sleep.

1044
01:25:57,607 --> 01:25:59,643
You must sleep, Robert,

1045
01:25:59,727 --> 01:26:02,605
if you are to heal others
as you've healed me.

1046
01:26:15,447 --> 01:26:18,439
It's all right.
It's all right.

1047
01:26:29,567 --> 01:26:31,956
We can only
wait and pray.

1048
01:26:32,007 --> 01:26:35,317
And then, if she should
start to slip away?

1049
01:26:35,367 --> 01:26:38,200
Then there is only
one thing can be done.

1050
01:26:38,327 --> 01:26:42,445
Katharine. Katharine.

1051
01:26:42,487 --> 01:26:44,364
The baby is large.

1052
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:46,967
You cannot
push it out of you.

1053
01:26:49,167 --> 01:26:51,840
Is there nothing
can be done to save it?

1054
01:26:51,887 --> 01:26:54,242
I must cut into the womb.

1055
01:26:55,967 --> 01:26:58,322
But if I do,
I shall lose you.

1056
01:26:58,407 --> 01:27:01,205
And I don't want
to lose you, Katharine.

1057
01:27:03,127 --> 01:27:05,277
You must save the child.

1058
01:27:18,487 --> 01:27:20,478
Are you not afraid?

1059
01:27:20,527 --> 01:27:22,882
You're leaving me, I fear.

1060
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:26,884
Nothing else.

1061
01:27:34,327 --> 01:27:36,636
Be with me now, Pearce.

1062
01:27:43,767 --> 01:27:46,486
Now, help me.
Hold back the flesh...

1063
01:27:46,567 --> 01:27:49,320
while I gently lever
the child out.

1064
01:27:58,527 --> 01:28:01,280
Ah! Oh! Huh!

1065
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:05,318
Katharine.

1066
01:28:05,407 --> 01:28:07,284
Katharine!

1067
01:28:07,327 --> 01:28:09,204
Katharine!

1068
01:28:23,327 --> 01:28:25,636
There's nothing
more I can do.

1069
01:28:27,247 --> 01:28:29,124
Sir!

1070
01:28:32,087 --> 01:28:33,918
Robert.

1071
01:28:40,087 --> 01:28:42,999
It is no John,
it is our little girl.

1072
01:28:45,807 --> 01:28:48,844
We shall call her Margaret.

1073
01:28:49,847 --> 01:28:52,315
Margaret.

1074
01:28:55,487 --> 01:28:58,285
I love you, Robert.

1075
01:28:58,367 --> 01:29:00,198
I love you.

1076
01:29:05,927 --> 01:29:07,997
Keep her safe.

1077
01:29:08,087 --> 01:29:10,282
I will.

1078
01:29:54,247 --> 01:29:58,604
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust,

1079
01:29:58,647 --> 01:30:02,799
in sure and certain hope
of resurrection to eternal life...

1080
01:30:02,887 --> 01:30:05,799
the Lord, Jesus Christ
who shall...

1081
01:30:11,367 --> 01:30:13,437
I write this for you, dear Margaret,

1082
01:30:13,527 --> 01:30:15,643
to tell you something
of my life.

1083
01:30:15,767 --> 01:30:17,883
Whatever is good in it
I owe to two people...

1084
01:30:18,007 --> 01:30:20,316
whom I could not save.

1085
01:30:20,407 --> 01:30:23,558
Your mother loved you
and gave her life for yours.

1086
01:30:23,607 --> 01:30:26,440
She was the bravest spirit
I ever knew.

1087
01:30:30,127 --> 01:30:34,086
The most compassionate
was my friend John Pearce.

1088
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:37,403
Now I know I must return
to our work in the hospital,

1089
01:30:37,487 --> 01:30:40,285
and take on the role
that was always meant for me.

1090
01:30:40,327 --> 01:30:42,443
I have arranged
for your safekeeping.

1091
01:30:42,527 --> 01:30:46,406
For if I become ill,
I will not return.

1092
01:31:22,207 --> 01:31:24,038
But they are
tied to the bed.

1093
01:31:24,127 --> 01:31:26,960
Those already affected
with the plague are tied...

1094
01:31:27,087 --> 01:31:30,875
to prevent them going into the streets
like madmen and infecting other people.

1095
01:31:30,967 --> 01:31:33,686
But the sick and the well
must be separated.

1096
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:35,917
Open it!

1097
01:31:36,007 --> 01:31:39,602
I can't, sir.
The proclamation. The plague!

1098
01:31:39,687 --> 01:31:41,518
Then I shall open it.

1099
01:32:13,887 --> 01:32:16,799
The sick and
the well they keep quarantined together.

1100
01:32:16,887 --> 01:32:20,357
If I were merely to separate them,
a great many lives would be saved.

1101
01:32:22,447 --> 01:32:25,405
Who do I have to thank
for this kindness?

1102
01:32:25,527 --> 01:32:27,802
One John Pearce.

1103
01:32:28,927 --> 01:32:30,804
The sick I can offer no cure.

1104
01:32:30,847 --> 01:32:33,202
But my presence among them
may bring with it some hope.

1105
01:32:35,487 --> 01:32:37,364
Fear is our greatest enemy.

1106
01:32:37,407 --> 01:32:39,716
And hope our best weapon
against the disease.

1107
01:32:53,447 --> 01:32:55,722
They have mistaken me
for John Pearce.

1108
01:32:55,807 --> 01:32:58,037
A mistake to which
I have contributed.

1109
01:32:58,127 --> 01:33:01,278
I allow them to continue
to honor my friend.

1110
01:33:02,807 --> 01:33:04,684
Dr. Pearce.

1111
01:33:08,887 --> 01:33:10,764
Excellent.

1112
01:33:17,487 --> 01:33:19,955
There you are.
Mary will show you out.

1113
01:33:31,167 --> 01:33:32,805
Margaret.

1114
01:33:33,087 --> 01:33:35,885
- Dr. Pearce.
- Who calls?

1115
01:34:21,447 --> 01:34:24,439
Pearce.

1116
01:34:24,487 --> 01:34:27,524
I give her
into your hands.

1117
01:34:27,567 --> 01:34:30,798
Call for any medicines.
Anything you deem suitable.

1118
01:35:16,687 --> 01:35:18,882
Why have they sent
another doctor to me?

1119
01:35:18,927 --> 01:35:21,760
You must want to live,
Lady Celia.

1120
01:35:21,807 --> 01:35:24,275
No.

1121
01:35:24,367 --> 01:35:26,722
Not in so wretched a state.

1122
01:35:38,847 --> 01:35:40,803
Tell me, Doctor,

1123
01:35:40,927 --> 01:35:42,804
why is it that
those that we love...

1124
01:35:42,927 --> 01:35:44,758
do not love us
in return?

1125
01:35:47,447 --> 01:35:51,406
I once loved a woman
who did not love me.

1126
01:35:51,447 --> 01:35:54,280
Yet I believed
that she did.

1127
01:35:56,607 --> 01:36:00,077
Is it not
equally possible...

1128
01:36:00,167 --> 01:36:03,921
to mistakenly
feel unloved?

1129
01:36:04,007 --> 01:36:09,001
I am one of many. I know
no special place in the King's heart.

1130
01:36:09,087 --> 01:36:11,885
The King does love
you, Lady Celia.

1131
01:36:13,287 --> 01:36:16,120
Why would he reveal such intimacies
to you and not to me?

1132
01:36:16,247 --> 01:36:19,683
He told me nothing,
but I recognized in him...

1133
01:36:19,767 --> 01:36:22,327
the very feelings
I myself have known.

1134
01:36:26,127 --> 01:36:29,358
How may I arrive
at such an understanding?

1135
01:36:29,447 --> 01:36:32,325
I used to look to the constellations
for some explanation...

1136
01:36:32,407 --> 01:36:35,240
in mysterious times
of my own life.

1137
01:36:35,327 --> 01:36:38,922
But the stars hold only
part of the answer, Lady Celia.

1138
01:36:39,007 --> 01:36:40,884
Now I look toward myself
and those who believed in me

1139
01:36:40,927 --> 01:36:43,157
and loved me
for the man I was.

1140
01:36:43,207 --> 01:36:46,085
Now I know we have
the power to shape our own destiny.

1141
01:36:46,207 --> 01:36:49,279
Your voice
sounds familiar.

1142
01:36:49,367 --> 01:36:53,042
Perhaps from some other time
in my life, when I was a child.

1143
01:36:53,127 --> 01:36:54,958
Yes.

1144
01:36:55,047 --> 01:36:58,119
Perhaps when
we were children.

1145
01:37:11,007 --> 01:37:14,682
Sire, I am familiar with
the many symptoms of the plague.

1146
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:17,565
Lady Celia suffers
from a different illness, a fever,

1147
01:37:17,647 --> 01:37:20,241
which I have treated
and from which she will recover.

1148
01:37:20,287 --> 01:37:22,881
And something else...
She is with child.

1149
01:37:27,167 --> 01:37:29,362
Good Doctor,

1150
01:37:29,447 --> 01:37:31,915
you have made my heart
exceeding glad.

1151
01:37:32,007 --> 01:37:35,044
But she is still haunted
by a profound melancholy.

1152
01:37:35,127 --> 01:37:38,756
It can be relieved only
by some assurance of love.

1153
01:37:42,087 --> 01:37:44,396
I do believe
I understand you.

1154
01:37:44,447 --> 01:37:46,836
I believe I do.

1155
01:37:46,887 --> 01:37:50,323
And now you must
remove your headdress...

1156
01:37:50,407 --> 01:37:52,841
and make yourself
known to us.

1157
01:37:52,887 --> 01:37:55,082
That, if Your Majesty will
forgive me, I cannot do.

1158
01:37:56,087 --> 01:37:58,442
I only hope
I've proved useful.

1159
01:38:06,687 --> 01:38:09,997
A large part of the city
is on fire.

1160
01:38:12,007 --> 01:38:14,919
Boatsman!

1161
01:38:26,487 --> 01:38:28,364
Go in!

1162
01:38:28,407 --> 01:38:30,318
All right.

1163
01:38:30,367 --> 01:38:32,403
I must find
my daughter.

1164
01:38:32,487 --> 01:38:34,717
Now, go in closer!

1165
01:39:00,407 --> 01:39:03,843
- Am I not near Cheapside?
- Save yourself, sir.

1166
01:39:03,887 --> 01:39:05,957
Cheapside is gone.

1167
01:39:22,767 --> 01:39:25,406
- Where am I?
- Get away from me!

1168
01:39:25,487 --> 01:39:28,923
- What street is this?
- I don't know!

1169
01:39:29,007 --> 01:39:30,838
Margaret!

1170
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:42,601
Margaret!

1171
01:40:52,007 --> 01:40:53,884
Someone in there.

1172
01:41:26,807 --> 01:41:29,082
Where am I?

1173
01:41:29,127 --> 01:41:32,085
Where am I?

1174
01:41:32,167 --> 01:41:35,443
You have come back
to Bidnold.

1175
01:41:35,527 --> 01:41:37,358
Will.

1176
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:43,003
I remember the journey.

1177
01:41:43,087 --> 01:41:44,918
I think not, sir.

1178
01:41:45,007 --> 01:41:47,680
You were asleep
for the most part of it.

1179
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:51,679
They found you
15 miles from here.

1180
01:41:51,767 --> 01:41:54,964
Stuck fast under a tree.

1181
01:41:58,407 --> 01:42:00,284
Margaret?

1182
01:42:00,327 --> 01:42:03,364
No word of Margaret?

1183
01:42:03,487 --> 01:42:05,318
Sir?

1184
01:42:08,567 --> 01:42:10,762
I wish you might
have known her, Will.

1185
01:42:10,807 --> 01:42:14,482
I had a little daughter.
A most beautiful little girl.

1186
01:43:03,967 --> 01:43:07,755
I feel as though old age has
come upon me in the space of a moment.

1187
01:44:00,007 --> 01:44:01,884
I fear I'm dreaming.

1188
01:44:01,927 --> 01:44:04,725
No, Merivel.
You are awake.

1189
01:44:08,607 --> 01:44:12,520
- Lady Celia has recovered.
- She was ill, Sire?

1190
01:44:12,607 --> 01:44:15,405
Yes, and I was led to believe
that a colleague of yours,

1191
01:44:15,447 --> 01:44:18,917
a certain John Pearce,
was responsible for her recovery.

1192
01:44:18,967 --> 01:44:22,004
However, Celia
thinks differently.

1193
01:44:22,087 --> 01:44:24,157
And her suspicions
were confirmed...

1194
01:44:24,207 --> 01:44:26,767
when a midwife carrying
a very young child...

1195
01:44:26,847 --> 01:44:30,556
came to our palace
in search of one...

1196
01:44:30,607 --> 01:44:32,484
Robert Merivel.

1197
01:44:32,567 --> 01:44:35,843
Your child, I believe.

1198
01:45:08,127 --> 01:45:09,958
Merivel.

1199
01:45:16,447 --> 01:45:19,120
I am not mistaken,
am I, Merivel,

1200
01:45:19,207 --> 01:45:21,038
about your love
for this place?

1201
01:45:21,127 --> 01:45:25,325
No, Sire. There are here in Bidnold
certain combinations of color...

1202
01:45:25,367 --> 01:45:27,562
I do not think exist
anywhere else in the world.

1203
01:45:27,607 --> 01:45:30,167
Yes, quite.

1204
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:32,681
Yes, your man Gates sent to us
and told us that...

1205
01:45:32,727 --> 01:45:35,764
you had returned
to your house.

1206
01:45:35,847 --> 01:45:37,917
My house, Sire?

1207
01:45:38,007 --> 01:45:39,838
Yes.

1208
01:45:39,927 --> 01:45:42,316
I am giving you Bidnold...

1209
01:45:42,407 --> 01:45:46,082
until my reign is over
and another age comes.

1210
01:45:46,167 --> 01:45:49,398
What was taken from you
is restored to you...

1211
01:45:49,447 --> 01:45:52,564
in return for the lives
you've saved...

1212
01:45:52,647 --> 01:45:55,320
and the man that
you have become.

1213
01:45:56,367 --> 01:45:58,676
It is your house, Merivel.

1214
01:45:58,767 --> 01:46:01,076
And I shall never
take it from you.

1215
01:46:06,767 --> 01:46:09,122
And I have commissioned
a portrait of you.

1216
01:46:13,287 --> 01:46:16,120
And it shall be called
"A Physician."

1217
01:46:20,767 --> 01:46:24,077
The fire in its
fury has consumed the great plague.

1218
01:46:24,167 --> 01:46:26,806
Misfortune may leave behind
unlooked-for blessings,

1219
01:46:26,887 --> 01:46:29,447
none dearer than you,
my little Margaret.

1220
01:46:32,807 --> 01:46:36,004
I will return to the city
to my work as a doctor,

1221
01:46:36,047 --> 01:46:39,084
and the rebuilding
of the King's hospital.

1222
01:46:39,167 --> 01:46:40,998
The stars that
once confused me...

1223
01:46:41,087 --> 01:46:43,647
seem now to light a path
that is clear,

1224
01:46:43,687 --> 01:46:46,520
that I have in truth been traveling
for all these days.

1225
01:46:48,607 --> 01:46:52,759
Where I met what came
and left behind my sorrows.

1226
01:46:52,807 --> 01:46:55,116
And I'm traveling still.
