00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:06,329
J.J. Madeleine,
I'd likeyou to meetJack Dawson.

- How doyou do?
- Pleasure.

3
00:00:08,503 --> 00:00:11,597
Hello,Jack.
Areyou ofthe Boston Dawsons?

4
00:00:11,673 --> 00:00:15,234
No-- the Chippewa Falls Dawsons,
actually.

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:17,005
Oh,yes. Yes.

6

Theyassumed
he wasone ofthem--

8
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:29,482
Heir to a railroadfortune,
perhaps.

9
00:00:29,558 --> 00:00:34,552
Newmoney, obviously,
butstilla memberofthe club.

10
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:37,928
Mother, ofcourse,

11
00:00:37,999 --> 00:00:41,025
Tell us ofthe accommodations
in steerage, Mr. Dawson.

12
00:00:41,103 --> 00:00:43,469
I hearthey're quite good
on this ship.

13
00:00:43,538 --> 00:00:48,100
The best I've seen, ma'am.
Hardly any rats.

14

( Laughter)

15
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:53,880
Mr. Dawson isjoining us
from the third class.

16
00:00:53,949 --> 00:00:57,112
He was ofsome assistance
to myfiancee last night.

17
00:00:57,185 --> 00:00:59,915
It turns out that Mr. Dawson
is quite a fine artist.

18
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:02,752
He was kind enough to show me
some of his worktoday.

19
00:01:02,824 --> 00:01:05,918
Rose and I differ somewhat
in our definition offine art.

20
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,962
Not to impugn yourwork, sir.

21

( Clears Throat)

22
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:15,602
Ismay:
She may be mine on paper

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,434
but in the eyes ofGod,
she belongs to Thomas Andrews.

24
00:01:18,507 --> 00:01:20,441
( Whispering):
Are these all for me?

25
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:22,704
Just start from the outside
and workyourway in.

26
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:25,008
He knows every rivet
in her, don'tyou, Thomas?

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,481
- Your ship is a wonder, truly.
- Thankyou, Rose.

28
00:01:31,353 --> 00:01:34,720
- And how doyou takeyour caviar, sir?
- No caviarfor me, thanks.

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:36,724
Never did like it much.

30
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:41,224
And where, exactly,
doyou live, Mr. Dawson?

31
00:01:41,296 --> 00:01:44,459
Well, right now, my address
is the R.M.S. Titanic.

32
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,933
Afterthat,
I'm on God's good humor.

33
00:01:47,002 --> 00:01:49,334
And how is it
you have means to travel?

34
00:01:49,404 --> 00:01:51,565
I work myway
from place to place--

35
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,870
You know,
tramp steamers and such.

36
00:01:53,942 --> 00:01:56,240
But I won myticket
on Titanic here

37
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:58,472
at a lucky hand at poker.

38
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:01,607
A very lucky hand.

39
00:02:01,683 --> 00:02:04,083
- All life is a game of luck.
- Mmm.

40
00:02:04,152 --> 00:02:06,086
A real man makes
his own luck, Archie.

41
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:08,645
- Right, Dawson?
- Mmm.

42
00:02:08,723 --> 00:02:13,524
And you find that sort of
rootless existence appealing, doyou?

43
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,355
Well,yes, ma'am, I do.

44
00:02:17,432 --> 00:02:21,163
I mean, got everything I need
right here with me.

45
00:02:21,236 --> 00:02:24,171
Got air in my lungs
and a few blank sheets of paper.

46
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,107
I mean, I love waking up in the morning
not knowing what's going to happen

47
00:02:28,176 --> 00:02:32,340
orwho I'm going to meet,
where I'm going to wind up.

48
00:02:32,414 --> 00:02:36,145
Just the other night, I was sleeping
under a bridge, and now here I am

49
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:39,381
on the grandest ship in the world
having champagne with you fine people.

50
00:02:39,454 --> 00:02:42,048
- ( Laughter)
- I'll take some more ofthat.

51
00:02:42,123 --> 00:02:45,251
I figure life's a gift,
and I don't intend on wasting it.

52
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:49,559
You never know what hand
you're going to get dealt next.

53
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:53,397
You learn to take life
as it comes atyou. Hereyou go, Cal.

54
00:02:53,468 --> 00:02:56,232
To make each day count.

55
00:02:56,304 --> 00:02:59,398
- Well said,Jack.
- Hear, hear!

56
00:02:59,474 --> 00:03:01,942
To making it count.

57
00:03:03,545 --> 00:03:06,639
- All: To making it count.
- Archie: Bravo.

( MollyLaughing)

59
00:03:13,655 --> 00:03:16,283
Mr. Brown had no idea
I'd hidden the money in the stove.

60
00:03:16,358 --> 00:03:18,292
( Laughter)

61
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,820
So he comes home drunk as a pig,
celebrating and he lights a fire.

62
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:25,662
( Laughter)

63
00:03:25,734 --> 00:03:28,532
( Softly): Next it'll be
brandies in the smoking room.

64
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:32,733
Archie:
Well,join me in a brandy, gentlemen?

65
00:03:32,807 --> 00:03:34,672
( MenAgree)

66
00:03:34,743 --> 00:03:37,007
Now they retreat into a cloud ofsmoke
and congratulate each other

67
00:03:37,078 --> 00:03:39,103
on being masters ofthe universe.

68
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,307
Ladies, thankyou for
the pleasure ofyour company.

69
00:03:41,383 --> 00:03:44,250
Rose, may I escortyou
backto the cabin?

70
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,982
- No, I'll stay here.
- Hereyou go, Molly.

71
00:03:48,056 --> 00:03:50,388
Archie:
Joining us, Dawson?

72
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:52,858
You don't want to stay out here
with the women, doyou?

73
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:54,725
No, thanks.
I've got to be heading back.

74
00:03:54,796 --> 00:03:56,730
- Ah.
- Probably best.

75
00:03:56,798 --> 00:03:59,392
It'll be all business
and politics, that sort ofthing--

76

Wouldn't interestyou.

77
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:04,431
But Dawson, good ofyou to come.

Jack, mustyou go?

79
00:04:11,413 --> 00:04:13,938
Time for me to go row
with the other slaves.

00:12:07,221 --> 00:12:09,314
You remind me every day.

156
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:15,090
Yourfather left us nothing but a legacy
of bad debts hidden by a good name.

157
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:18,064
That name is the only card
we have to play.

158
00:12:18,132 --> 00:12:22,466
I don't understand you.
It is a fine match with Hockley.

159
00:12:22,537 --> 00:12:27,998
- It will ensure our survival.
- How can you put this on my shoulders?

160
00:12:28,075 --> 00:12:32,375
- Why areyou being so selfish?
- I'm being selfish?

161
00:12:35,616 --> 00:12:38,881
Doyou want to see me
working as a seamstress?

162
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:42,982
Is that whatyou want?

163
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:48,987
To see ourfine things
sold at auction?

164
00:12:49,063 --> 00:12:51,327
Our memories
scattered to the winds?

165
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:04,071
( Sighs)
It's so unfair.

166
00:13:05,313 --> 00:13:08,441
Ofcourse it's unfair.

167
00:13:08,516 --> 00:13:10,450
We're women.

168
00:13:12,153 --> 00:13:14,781
Our choices are never easy.

169
00:13:21,729 --> 00:13:23,663
Hmm?

170
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:40,179
Congregation:
" Protect them byThy guardian hand "

171
00:13:40,248 --> 00:13:46,847
" From every peril
on the land. "

00:14:06,107 --> 00:14:10,305
"And keep them
byThywatchful... "

177
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,080
- Hello, Mr. Andrews.
- Hello,Jack.

178
00:14:23,991 --> 00:14:27,154
- Sir.
- I need to talkto somebodyfor a sec.

179
00:14:27,228 --> 00:14:29,719
You're not supposed
to be in here.

180
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:33,324
" ...fire and foe
Protect them... "

181
00:14:33,401 --> 00:14:35,301
I wasjust here last night.
You don't remember me?

182
00:14:35,369 --> 00:14:37,894
No, I'm afraid I don't.
Nowyou're going to have to turn around.

183
00:14:37,972 --> 00:14:40,372
He'll tell you.
I just-- I just need--

184
00:14:40,441 --> 00:14:43,808
Mr. Hockley
and Mrs. Dewitt Bukater

185
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:46,813
continue to be appreciative
ofyour assistance.

186
00:14:46,881 --> 00:14:50,578
They asked me to, uh...
giveyou this in gratitude.

187
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:53,711
- I don't wantyour money. Please, l--
- And also to remind you...

188
00:14:53,788 --> 00:14:55,847
thatyou hold
a third-class ticket

189
00:14:55,923 --> 00:14:58,448
and thatyour presence here
is no longer appropriate.

190
00:14:58,526 --> 00:15:00,460
Please, I just want
to speakto Rose for--

191
00:15:00,528 --> 00:15:04,464
Gentlemen, will you please see that
Mr. Dawson gets to where he belongs

192
00:15:04,532 --> 00:15:06,727
and that he stays there?

193
00:15:06,801 --> 00:15:09,736
Yes, sir.
Come along,you.

194
00:15:11,539 --> 00:15:14,702
" Oh, hear us
when we cryto Thee "

195
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:20,577
" Forthose in peril
on the sea. "

196
00:15:20,648 --> 00:15:22,673
Ruth: And why doyou have
two steering wheels?

197
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,684
We really only use
this near shore.

198
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:27,983
Excuse me, sir. Another ice warning.
This one's from the Noordam.

199
00:15:28,055 --> 00:15:30,649
Thankyou, Sparks.

200
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:35,485
Oh, not to worry.
Quite normal forthis time ofyear.

201
00:15:35,563 --> 00:15:37,622
In fact, we're speeding up.

202
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:40,462
I'vejust ordered
the last boilers lit.

203
00:15:44,238 --> 00:15:47,298
Man: Okay, son,
wind it up tight like I showed you.

204
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,809
Okay, now, let it go.

205
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:54,638
- Was good, wasn't it?
- Quite nice.

206
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:57,240
That's excellent, son.

207
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:04,658
Rose:
Mr. Andrews, forgive me...

208
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:08,092
I did the sum in my head
and with the number of lifeboats

209
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:10,596
times the capacityyou mentioned

210
00:16:10,665 --> 00:16:14,260
forgive me, but it seems that there
are not enough for everyone aboard.

211
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,361
About half, actually.

212
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:22,034
Rose,you miss nothing, doyou?
ln fact, I put in these new type davits

213
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,976
which can take an extra row
of boats inside this one

214
00:16:25,046 --> 00:16:29,380
but it was thought by some
that the deckwould looktoo cluttered

215
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:32,510
so I was overruled.

216
00:16:32,586 --> 00:16:35,749
Waste ofdeck space as it is
on an unsinkable ship.

217
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:40,453
Sleep soundly,young Rose. I have built
you a good ship, strong and true.

218
00:16:40,528 --> 00:16:42,462
She's all the lifeboatyou need.

219
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:46,022
Just keep heading aft.
The next stop will be the engine room.

220
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,295
Come on.

221
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:55,367
Jack, this is impossible.
I can't seeyou.

222
00:16:55,443 --> 00:16:59,903
- I need to talktoyou.
- No,Jack, no.

223
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:03,040
Jack, I'm engaged.

224
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:07,178
I'm marrying Cal.
I love Cal.

225
00:17:09,457 --> 00:17:13,257
Rose,you're no picnic.

226
00:17:13,327 --> 00:17:16,125
All right,you're a spoiled
little brat, even

227
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:20,998
but underthatyou're the most
amazingly astounding

228
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:25,198
wonderful girl-- woman--
that I've ever known and...

229
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:27,763
-Jack, l...
- No, let me try and get this out.

230
00:17:27,842 --> 00:17:31,573
You're,you're ama--

231
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:34,978
I'm not an idiot.
I know how the world works.

232
00:17:35,049 --> 00:17:36,983
I've got ten bucks
in my pocket.

233
00:17:37,051 --> 00:17:39,849
I have nothing to offeryou
and I know that.

234
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,616
I understand.

235
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:46,820
But I'm too involved now.
Youjump, I jump, remember?

236
00:17:46,894 --> 00:17:51,024
I can't turn away
without knowingyou'll be all right.

237
00:17:51,098 --> 00:17:53,692
That's all that I want.

238
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:56,202
Well, I'm fine.

239
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:59,398
I'll be fine, really.

240
00:17:59,473 --> 00:18:01,873
Really?

241
00:18:03,277 --> 00:18:07,976
I don't think so.
They've gotyou trapped, Rose

242
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:09,845
and you're going to die
ifyou don't breakfree--

243
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:13,478
Maybe not right away
becauseyou're strong, but

244
00:18:13,554 --> 00:18:17,149
sooner or laterthat fire
that I love aboutyou, Rose...

245
00:18:17,224 --> 00:18:19,954
that fire is going to burn out.

246
00:18:24,565 --> 00:18:26,624
It's not up toyou
to save me,Jack.

247
00:18:28,803 --> 00:18:33,206
You're right.
Onlyyou can do that.

248
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,477
I'm going back.
Leave me alone.

249
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,162
Countess: Tell Lucille about the
disasteryou had with the stationer's.

250
00:18:57,231 --> 00:19:00,325
Well, ofcourse, the invitations
had to be sent back twice.

251
00:19:00,401 --> 00:19:03,393
- Oh, my dear!
- And the dreadful bridesmaid's gowns--

252
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:05,768
Let me tell you what an odyssey
that has been.

253
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,207
Rose decided
she wanted lavender.

254
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:12,143
She knows I detest the color,
so she did it onlyto spite me.

255
00:19:12,213 --> 00:19:14,545
Lucille:
lfonlyyou'd come to me sooner.

256
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:17,584
Ruth saw some of my designs
in "La Mode Illustree."

257
00:19:17,651 --> 00:19:21,052
Theywere forTrousseau ofthe Duchess
of Malborough'syoungest daughter.

258
00:19:21,121 --> 00:19:24,454
Theywere quite charming, but I think
you'll agree, my dear, that together

259
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:26,789
we've created something ofa phoenix
from the ashes.

260
00:19:26,861 --> 00:19:28,795
( Women Laugh Politely)

261
00:19:42,276 --> 00:19:44,244
Hello,Jack.

262
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:51,083
I changed my mind.

263
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:58,258
- They said you might be--
- Shh.

264
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,556
Give meyour hand.

265
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,698
Now closeyour eyes.

266
00:20:12,773 --> 00:20:14,707
Go on.

267
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,272
Step up.

268
00:20:22,316 --> 00:20:24,250
Now hold on to the railing.

269
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:27,412
- Keepyour eyes closed, don't peek.
- I'm not.

270
00:20:28,856 --> 00:20:31,290
Step up onto the rail.

271
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:38,161
Hold on. Hold on.
Keepyour eyes closed.

272
00:20:38,232 --> 00:20:41,258
- ( Giggles)
- Doyou trust me?

273
00:20:41,335 --> 00:20:43,565
I trustyou.

274
00:20:52,413 --> 00:20:56,042
All right, open your eyes.

275
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:05,823
I'm flying!Jack!

276
00:21:29,149 --> 00:21:33,483
( Softly):
" Come,Josephine, myflying machine "

277
00:21:33,554 --> 00:21:36,421
" Going up, she goes "

278
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:39,357
" Up, she goes... "

279
00:22:26,073 --> 00:22:29,270
That was the last time Titanic
ever saw daylight.

280
00:22:29,343 --> 00:22:33,439
So we're up to dusk
the night ofthe sinking.

281
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,005
- Six hours to go.
- Incredible.

282
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:38,677
There's Smith and he's standing there
and he's got the iceberg warning...

283
00:22:38,752 --> 00:22:43,155
in his fucking hand-- excuse me--
his hand, and he's ordering more speed.

284
00:22:43,223 --> 00:22:46,056
26years ofexperience
working against him.

285
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:48,617
He figures anything big enough
to sinkthe ship

286
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:50,856
they're going to see
in time to turn

287
00:22:50,931 --> 00:22:53,798
but the ship's too big
with too small a rudder.

288
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:56,563
Doesn't cornerworth a damn.

289
00:22:56,637 --> 00:22:59,572
Everything he knows is wrong.

290
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:13,886
( Laughing)
It's quite proper, I assureyou.

291
00:23:13,954 --> 00:23:17,355
This is the sitting room.

292
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:19,517
- Will this light do?
- What?

293
00:23:19,593 --> 00:23:21,754
Don't artists need good light?

294
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:23,763
( ln French Accent):
That is true

295
00:23:23,831 --> 00:23:26,629
but I'm not used to working
in such horrible conditions.

296
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,464
Monet!

297
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:32,630
- Doyou know his work?
- Ofcourse.

298
00:23:32,706 --> 00:23:34,867
Look at his use ofcolor here.
Isn't he great?

299
00:23:34,942 --> 00:23:36,876
I know, it's extraordinary.

300
00:23:38,879 --> 00:23:43,145
Cal insists on carting
this hideous thing everywhere.

301
00:23:43,217 --> 00:23:46,482
Should we be expecting him
anytime soon?

302
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:50,512
Not as long as the cigars
and brandy hold out.

303
00:23:52,292 --> 00:23:56,922
- That's nice.
- What is it, a sapphire?

304
00:23:56,997 --> 00:24:00,660
A diamond,
a very rare diamond.

305
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:09,668
Jack, I wantyou to draw me like one
ofyour French girls... wearing this.

306
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:12,576
All right.

307
00:24:12,646 --> 00:24:14,841

your clothes back on, dear.

( DistantShouting)

779
01:06:19,183 --> 01:06:21,117
Pull!

780
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,120
Now, there's something
you don't see every day.

781
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,622
Pull!

782
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:32,427
( DistantExplosion)

783
01:06:34,298 --> 01:06:37,131
( Shouting)

784
01:06:46,444 --> 01:06:48,776
Crewman:
What's this luggage doing here?

785
01:06:48,846 --> 01:06:53,783
- Get rid of it, we need the room.
- (Crewman Giving Orders)

786
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:55,819
( Crying)

787
01:06:55,886 --> 01:06:57,820
Keep calm.

788
01:06:57,888 --> 01:07:00,015
No!

789
01:07:04,295 --> 01:07:07,594
-Lovejoy.
-She's not on the starboard side either.

790
01:07:07,665 --> 01:07:10,225
We're running out oftime
and this strutting martinet

791
01:07:10,301 --> 01:07:12,235
isn't letting
any men on at all.

792
01:07:12,303 --> 01:07:14,897
There's one on the other side
letting men on.

793
01:07:14,972 --> 01:07:19,671
Well, then, that's our play. We'll need
some insurance first. Come on.

794
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:21,769
- ( Pounding)
- This way.

795
01:07:21,846 --> 01:07:25,441
- All the way down here.
- (Jack Yelling)

796
01:07:25,516 --> 01:07:29,816
Steward:
Here! What doyou thinkyou're doing?

797
01:07:29,887 --> 01:07:33,288
You'll have to payforthat,you know.
That's White Star Line property.

798
01:07:33,357 --> 01:07:36,224
Both:
Shut up!

799
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:40,491
Will you hold the boat a moment?
I just have to run backto my room--

800
01:07:40,564 --> 01:07:44,125
Sit down! She's the last.
All right to lower.

801
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:47,295
Mr. Lightoller, why are the boats
being launched halffull?

802
01:07:47,371 --> 01:07:50,465
- Not now, Mr. Andrews.
- There, look, 20 or so

803
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:54,238
in a boat built for 65,
and I saw one boat with only 1 2-- 1 2!

804
01:07:54,311 --> 01:07:58,645
Well, we weren't sure ofthe weight,
Mr. Andrews. These boats may buckle.

805
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:03,119
Rubbish! Theywere tested in Belfast
with the weight of70 men!

806
01:08:03,187 --> 01:08:06,714
Now, fill these boats,
Mr. Lightoller, for God's sake, man!

807
01:08:12,763 --> 01:08:15,994
Please, I need more women
and children, please.

808
01:08:20,004 --> 01:08:22,996
Crewman: Get back in there.
This is not an exit.

809
01:08:23,074 --> 01:08:25,702
Get back in there.
This is not an exit.

810
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:31,543
You can't keep us locked in here like
animals. The ship's bloody sinking!
