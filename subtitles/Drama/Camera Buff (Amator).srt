1
00:00:27,752 --> 00:00:30,710
CAMERA BUFF

2
00:01:20,435 --> 00:01:22,313
Filip, it's starting!

3
00:01:32,236 --> 00:01:33,236
He's drunk

4
00:01:51,317 --> 00:01:52,636
Irenka!

5
00:01:54,997 --> 00:01:56,829
Guess what?

6
00:01:57,877 --> 00:02:01,632
- I think it's a girl
- That's great!

7
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:11,033
- Where's my wife's ward?
- First floor

8
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,911
Is that her?

9
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:17,789
No, it's not her.
It's some young girl

10
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,991
You won't be a father for hours

11
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,668
Irenka!

12
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,951
I'll have 320kg ready for you
next week

13
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,549
Thank you for ringing. 'Bye

14
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:53,273
I know it's against the rules, sir.
But I've brought this little snack

15
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,799
- Already?
- Well, she's at the hospital

16
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:00,550
All right, as a symbolic
gesture then

17
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,399
She's gone into labour

18
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:24,962
It'll be a while yet,
my first took 20 hours

19
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:28,155
OK folks, run along now

20
00:03:29,363 --> 00:03:33,323
Take my keys. There's food
in the fridge

21
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:35,833
Here's the drink

22
00:03:38,924 --> 00:03:40,880
No. I've got some more

23
00:03:55,165 --> 00:03:56,883
You're here, Witek

24
00:04:02,245 --> 00:04:04,760
I never drank so much in my life

25
00:04:05,365 --> 00:04:06,560
Mr. Mosz!

26
00:04:34,327 --> 00:04:35,681
It's a girl!

27
00:04:43,928 --> 00:04:46,396
Wait, I can't go in like this

28
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,205
A girl!

29
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,689
Mr. Mosz...

30
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:21,761
We came here, saw your new flat,
had a few drinks...

31
00:05:22,011 --> 00:05:25,970
We saw how moved you were
at becoming a father...

32
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:28,366
I'm getting old now

33
00:05:29,131 --> 00:05:32,806
All I can say is that I envy you

34
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:38,363
Now I know what human
happiness looks like

35
00:05:38,892 --> 00:05:39,960
Filip!

36
00:05:49,332 --> 00:05:50,652
Call me Stanislaw

37
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,768
- May I call you Stasiu?
- You must!

38
00:06:00,373 --> 00:06:02,409
Why didn't you take her these?

39
00:06:02,533 --> 00:06:07,971
I forgot. I had a dressing gown,
cream and a comb. I'll go now

40
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:12,964
It's 10 o'clock. Tomorrow will do.
Where shall I put them?

41
00:06:18,774 --> 00:06:22,734
It's a mess now, but
it'll be a super flat

42
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:27,087
We'll put the cot here,
with a table next to it

43
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:31,333
Here we'll keep the nappies,
clean ones... dirty ones...

44
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,006
And baby's toilet things

45
00:06:36,015 --> 00:06:37,734
All painted white

46
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,254
What are you doing?

47
00:06:41,376 --> 00:06:45,163
- What's this?
- Nothing special

48
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:54,255
- It's a camera
- A film camera?

49
00:06:54,376 --> 00:06:59,576
I want to take pictures of
the child month by month

50
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:01,773
How much did it cost?

51
00:07:01,897 --> 00:07:06,175
Two months' pay.
Irenka was a bit cross

52
00:07:06,298 --> 00:07:10,336
- Moving pictures?
- Yes, like in the cinema

53
00:07:10,537 --> 00:07:12,574
It's a great idea

54
00:07:12,817 --> 00:07:14,809
She can see herself grow up

55
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,288
Wrong way round. Like this

56
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:32,977
Turn the volume up

57
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:06,892
He was marvellous

58
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,692
Irenka plays this

59
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:25,021
I need flowers. These will do!

60
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:33,494
- Filip, it's the boss's house!
- Oh hell!

61
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:45,862
- Name?
- Mosz

62
00:08:47,343 --> 00:08:51,496
Your wife has mastitis.
We'll have to keep her in...

63
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:53,860
...unless she can get help
at home

64
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:57,216
Her sister might, but she works

65
00:08:57,424 --> 00:08:59,892
Is it dangerous, doctor?

66
00:09:00,384 --> 00:09:03,103
- No
- What a pity!

67
00:09:04,345 --> 00:09:06,734
I wanted to film the baby

68
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:15,213
- Is it Russian?
- Yes, a Kwarc 2

69
00:09:15,345 --> 00:09:16,937
May I have a look?

70
00:09:33,227 --> 00:09:36,105
OK. But only for a few minutes

71
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,303
Ours?

72
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:51,902
Irenka

73
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,504
Have you touched her?

74
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,341
Of course!

75
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:02,664
They bring her to me for feeds

76
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:06,026
From a bottle

77
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,698
See what a mother I am

78
00:10:14,509 --> 00:10:17,467
I can't even feed my own baby

79
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,060
I love you, Irenka

80
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,982
I love you

81
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,503
She's smiling.
Can I film her now?

82
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,909
She's wet herself

83
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,824
No, not naked

84
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,909
- Why not?
- She's a girl

85
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:16,344
Has someone died?

86
00:11:16,473 --> 00:11:20,022
No, Piotrek drives a hearse.
He brought the cot

87
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,144
It gave me quite a turn

88
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:29,432
Irena Mosz

89
00:11:43,114 --> 00:11:47,154
Oh! I forgot to film you
coming in

90
00:11:47,715 --> 00:11:51,424
- I'll do it when she wakes up
- No, it'd be a bad omen

91
00:11:56,596 --> 00:12:01,271
Halt! Turn! Form up into
two lines

92
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,873
Masks off!

93
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,349
Good morning

94
00:12:16,556 --> 00:12:19,707
- You're fit!
- No, I was late

95
00:12:19,957 --> 00:12:22,551
The exercise has been
carried out, Commander

96
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:27,188
Drop in with Osuch
when this is over

97
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:28,750
Masks on!

98
00:12:32,357 --> 00:12:34,588
If anyone calls, I'm out

99
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:48,551
I asked you both so you couldn't
deny that you own a camera

100
00:12:51,158 --> 00:12:52,353
I do

101
00:12:52,599 --> 00:12:54,749
I believe it makes films

102
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,915
So the instructions say

103
00:13:00,039 --> 00:13:03,032
Did you know that our Jubilee
is imminent?

104
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,589
Yes, the 25th anniversary

105
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,119
We expect...

106
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,839
...a lot of VIP's

107
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,520
Yes, we've booked the artists

108
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,594
This occasion can't just
come and go

109
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:20,201
We must record it

110
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:24,394
I want you to film it

111
00:13:26,241 --> 00:13:31,554
I've only just bought the camera.
I wouldn't know how

112
00:13:31,681 --> 00:13:36,039
You'll learn. How did I learn
about gardening?

113
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,318
From books. And Stasiu?

114
00:13:38,562 --> 00:13:41,440
He learnt about stamps
from books

115
00:13:42,082 --> 00:13:43,721
You have a camera

116
00:13:44,682 --> 00:13:47,037
- And film?
- No, sir

117
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:49,638
What's our Culture budget?

118
00:13:49,883 --> 00:13:53,636
113,000 zlotys.
We could start a club

119
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:57,512
We tried amateur theatre.
It didn't work

120
00:13:58,603 --> 00:14:03,757
Theatre! Cinema is
the supreme art

121
00:14:04,444 --> 00:14:07,003
- Who said that?
- Lenin

122
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:09,995
So, is it a deal?

123
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,472
It's a deal

124
00:14:15,044 --> 00:14:17,194
Stasiu, you're the witness

125
00:14:28,405 --> 00:14:31,158
Do you always go that fast?

126
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:35,837
Are you kidding? When I'm working
I crawl along

127
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,796
Do you want a lift, Irenka?

128
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:07,244
She's lovely!

129
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,997
Look at this equipment:
a projector, a stand, film...

130
00:15:14,248 --> 00:15:16,159
Did you buy it?

131
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:20,524
The plant bought it.
Director's orders

132
00:15:21,248 --> 00:15:25,925
Piotrek, how can I pay you for
the lift? I'll buy you a bottle

133
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:28,367
Don't bother

134
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:31,763
Just film me by the van

135
00:15:31,969 --> 00:15:34,437
Mum will watch it three times

136
00:15:37,449 --> 00:15:39,565
He's going to film me!

137
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,965
Take me driving down the slope

138
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,890
Why did they buy it?

139
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:55,798
The director wants to film
the Jubilee

140
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,927
He wants me to make the film.
Quite a challenge!

141
00:16:00,051 --> 00:16:01,961
Does it have to be you?

142
00:16:02,091 --> 00:16:04,524
I'm the only one with a camera

143
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:10,847
You bought it to film the baby

144
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:12,923
Damn, he's driving too fast

145
00:16:18,412 --> 00:16:21,529
- Did you get it?
- In technicolour!

146
00:16:32,333 --> 00:16:34,449
Do you know what Witek asked me?

147
00:16:34,693 --> 00:16:37,969
How come I had everything?

148
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:41,928
The baby, you, this place...

149
00:16:42,613 --> 00:16:46,049
I said it was all I wanted

150
00:16:46,614 --> 00:16:50,084
If you want something badly,
you get it

151
00:16:51,054 --> 00:16:53,932
It's a form of justice,
I suppose

152
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:56,646
You're a good man

153
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:27,052
Look at him! You'd think he was
born holding a camera

154
00:17:51,818 --> 00:17:54,378
1,600 zlotys for you. 20 % tax

155
00:17:57,258 --> 00:18:00,614
Name? That'll be 2,340 zlotys
for you

156
00:18:03,139 --> 00:18:05,255
Oh, leave it on the chair

157
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:10,859
- This is for you
- Thanks. See you next time

158
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,619
Still here?

159
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:28,779
- You're sweating
- Of course. How did you like me?

160
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:32,529
- You really want to know?
- Actually, take it off

161
00:18:50,661 --> 00:18:55,053
You can't go in there.
Film them as they come out

162
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,374
I'll call you

163
00:20:01,186 --> 00:20:03,780
- Watch out!
- You idiot!

164
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,416
What are you filming?

165
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:17,023
Anything that moves

166
00:20:17,427 --> 00:20:22,421
- Where are they?
- In there. I missed them going in

167
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:27,017
Shoot my feet going down
the corridor

168
00:20:27,148 --> 00:20:30,423
Then my hand on the door handle.
We'll edit it later

169
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:32,140
Don't be silly

170
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:18,267
Are you filming people
going to the toilet?

171
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,859
I thought they were all coming out

172
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:25,030
Why not hide in the toilet?
That's enough!

173
00:21:32,872 --> 00:21:34,385
What was that about?

174
00:21:34,512 --> 00:21:37,948
He wanted it nice and formal,
the idiot

175
00:22:15,715 --> 00:22:17,113
She's asleep

176
00:22:18,675 --> 00:22:20,266
What happened?

177
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:23,152
To the mirror?

178
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:26,868
- It broke
- How?

179
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,784
- I broke it
- Why?

180
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:34,751
What were you going to say
earlier?

181
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:38,148
- Come here
- No

182
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,312
Why did you break it?

183
00:22:40,516 --> 00:22:43,906
I hit it with my hand
and it broke

184
00:22:44,036 --> 00:22:45,264
Which one?

185
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:08,116
I saw you leaving the plant.
You looked so tiny

186
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:11,676
I'll never forget the way
you looked

187
00:23:17,798 --> 00:23:21,587
- No, it's too soon
- It's a month now

188
00:23:21,719 --> 00:23:25,155
- It might hurt
- Then we'll stop

189
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,718
Look how I've cut the film:
first the artists...

190
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,598
Then the boss. Is it clear
he's listening?

191
00:23:58,121 --> 00:24:00,430
I'll run it backwards.
The artists...

192
00:24:00,681 --> 00:24:02,160
...the boss

193
00:24:02,521 --> 00:24:04,477
The artists... the boss

194
00:24:10,802 --> 00:24:12,757
My mum's fainted

195
00:24:12,881 --> 00:24:13,997
What is it?

196
00:24:14,122 --> 00:24:18,513
I don't know. Help me take her
to the hospital

197
00:24:22,322 --> 00:24:24,883
You can't take her in a hearse

198
00:24:25,322 --> 00:24:29,396
- You're right. I'll get a doctor
- I'll go

199
00:24:32,643 --> 00:24:37,763
- She can't go in a hearse
- I'm calling a doctor. You go up

200
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:43,397
I must get the baby to sleep.
She's thrown up again

201
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:57,964
She's come round,
but she can't move

202
00:24:58,085 --> 00:25:00,599
- At all?
- Only her eyes

203
00:25:05,645 --> 00:25:07,363
Get an ambulance

204
00:25:09,125 --> 00:25:12,242
- I have a stretcher
- I'll wait here

205
00:25:15,125 --> 00:25:17,765
- Does he mean the hearse?
- Yes

206
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:26,044
- How's the baby?
- Fine, thanks

207
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:29,876
- What do you call her?
- Irenka

208
00:25:49,607 --> 00:25:53,203
- Terrible, going in that
- She won't come back

209
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:14,482
That's all there is

210
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,799
You've done very well

211
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:22,168
I like the bit with the pay-out

212
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,886
- Why not add a commentary, though?
- What kind?

213
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,570
It's up to you, of course

214
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,847
But I'd like to know who spoke...

215
00:26:34,691 --> 00:26:36,726
...what the occasion was

216
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,729
- It's obvious
- Music would help

217
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:44,329
Music... a commentary.
Like on the TV news

218
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:50,965
Congratulations.
Come back and see me later

219
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:54,571
Now we're alone...

220
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:58,282
Why showthe fellow with glasses?

221
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,805
He was just there

222
00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:04,601
I want to see less of him

223
00:27:05,732 --> 00:27:07,451
Less of him?

224
00:27:07,972 --> 00:27:12,171
Better still, I don't want to see
him at all. And the pigeons?

225
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:14,566
Let's have them out

226
00:27:15,493 --> 00:27:18,087
Three things are out:

227
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:23,130
The fellow with the glasses, the two
going for a pee, the pigeons...

228
00:27:23,373 --> 00:27:26,410
- And the pay-out
- That's four things

229
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:30,093
Let's make it four, then

230
00:27:31,414 --> 00:27:34,771
I'll leave the pay-out and
cut the pigeons

231
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:36,373
If I were you...

232
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:41,450
...I'd leave the pigeons and
cut the pay-out. OK?

233
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:45,015
You've been making notes, sir?

234
00:27:45,615 --> 00:27:48,493
I take this seriously. Look

235
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,290
I bought a pen

236
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,574
With a light?

237
00:27:54,535 --> 00:27:56,174
Watch this

238
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:06,329
You'll like it here

239
00:28:06,457 --> 00:28:09,335
- A bit cold in winter
- In winter?

240
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:13,646
The boiler room is next door

241
00:28:15,137 --> 00:28:17,014
What's in there?

242
00:28:19,537 --> 00:28:23,815
You can use that as a cupboard

243
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:32,136
I like it here

244
00:28:35,019 --> 00:28:38,216
It's funny howthings work out

245
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:40,614
Will I be doing something?

246
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:45,896
- A film, I mean
- You most certainly will

247
00:28:48,619 --> 00:28:51,258
I must go to the cinema
more often

248
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:57,689
There's this silence
in the cinema

249
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:05,013
She starts throwing things at him,
but you can't see it

250
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:10,095
It's clever. You don't see him,
just things whizzing past him

251
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,096
- I'll comb her hair
- No, don't

252
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,730
Does she have to look a mess?

253
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:21,374
The child is the most moving during
the row. When she picks it up...

254
00:29:21,621 --> 00:29:23,373
...and it's crying

255
00:29:23,621 --> 00:29:28,775
That bit sticks in your mind.
Not the happy scenes

256
00:29:33,302 --> 00:29:35,975
Leave it! Nowtake her

257
00:29:39,983 --> 00:29:41,973
Go to the window

258
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,296
Beautiful!

259
00:29:48,903 --> 00:29:52,942
If she'd fallen over, would you
have shot that as well?

260
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:57,854
- You should be ashamed of yourself
- Why? Nothing happened

261
00:29:58,424 --> 00:30:00,778
They're digging up the pavement

262
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:03,777
They're always doing that

263
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:07,983
- I'll go down and get a few shots
- Can't you do it from here?

264
00:30:08,104 --> 00:30:10,743
You're right. I'll get the tripod

265
00:30:14,905 --> 00:30:16,941
That was smart thinking

266
00:30:26,505 --> 00:30:28,735
It'll be a documentary film

267
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:02,224
What are you reading?

268
00:31:02,907 --> 00:31:06,138
I'm just looking at pictures

269
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:23,105
- What's the matter?
- I dreamt a hawk killed a chicken

270
00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:25,539
It's just a dream

271
00:31:25,669 --> 00:31:28,706
I heard its beak hammering
the skull

272
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,745
I'll get myself some bread

273
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,950
I always wanted to ask you,
why do you eat at night?

274
00:31:58,511 --> 00:32:02,390
It's a habit I picked up
at the orphanage

275
00:32:05,871 --> 00:32:08,101
What's it all about, Filip?

276
00:32:09,792 --> 00:32:12,226
I mean the films, the club...

277
00:32:12,432 --> 00:32:14,309
I don't know

278
00:32:15,992 --> 00:32:18,904
One thing led to another

279
00:32:20,073 --> 00:32:22,029
And now you're hooked

280
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:24,905
I suppose I am

281
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,787
Promise me one thing?

282
00:32:32,834 --> 00:32:35,826
That you'll give it up

283
00:32:36,513 --> 00:32:38,311
Go to sleep

284
00:32:40,834 --> 00:32:44,304
I was just in time.
I got it all

285
00:32:45,954 --> 00:32:50,152
- There's someone to see you
- A beautiful woman

286
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:51,907
She's in the office

287
00:32:52,154 --> 00:32:53,986
She wanted to smoke

288
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:56,953
I'll be off then

289
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:11,110
Here he is!

290
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:16,068
This is Filip Mosz,
our film-maker

291
00:33:16,316 --> 00:33:20,514
Anna Wlodarczyk. I'm from the
Amateur Film Federation

292
00:33:20,636 --> 00:33:25,108
Your boss suggested that we include
your film in our festival

293
00:33:25,237 --> 00:33:27,797
We show films of people at work

294
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:31,314
I don't think that's wise.
It was meant...

295
00:33:31,557 --> 00:33:32,751
...only for us

296
00:33:32,997 --> 00:33:34,908
I'm impressed!

297
00:33:35,877 --> 00:33:40,508
Most people make films
only to win prizes

298
00:33:40,638 --> 00:33:42,070
Take a seat

299
00:33:45,918 --> 00:33:49,115
Here are the rules
and an entry form

300
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:52,236
I'll expect you in Lodz
next month

301
00:33:52,478 --> 00:33:54,628
We're not members of
the Federation

302
00:33:54,758 --> 00:33:56,636
Didn't you apply?

303
00:33:57,598 --> 00:33:58,918
Of course

304
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:03,589
Then you're members.
Can we see the film?

305
00:34:04,879 --> 00:34:06,870
I'll take the call in there

306
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,711
Excuse me. I won't be long

307
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,073
- Cigarette?
- No, thanks

308
00:34:30,561 --> 00:34:32,516
Come in a moment, Filip

309
00:34:34,681 --> 00:34:38,356
Shut the door. Is it finished?

310
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:42,633
- Just the commentary
- And the matter we discussed?

311
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:45,321
No. We'd better not show it

312
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,201
Go downstairs

313
00:34:57,122 --> 00:34:58,841
Does it make sense?

314
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,602
Yes, but why is it hacked
to pieces?

315
00:35:04,923 --> 00:35:06,435
You ran out of film?

316
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,160
Well, it's early days

317
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:19,682
Sure, practice makes perfect.
We'll take the film

318
00:35:43,246 --> 00:35:45,520
It's great, isn't it?

319
00:35:46,765 --> 00:35:48,357
Look at this, Stasiu

320
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:52,524
You've really got carried away,
Filip

321
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,125
We're getting a phone

322
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:56,322
It's been rubber-stamped

323
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:06,565
- Like it?
- That's not what I meant

324
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:08,604
You pay, I deliver

325
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:14,446
My brother-in-law found God
at the age of 30

326
00:36:15,287 --> 00:36:17,324
So what? I'm 30 myself

327
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:22,037
- He came to a bad end
- What happened?

328
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:24,000
He became a priest

329
00:36:29,848 --> 00:36:34,080
Everyone has a hobby.
You've got your stamps

330
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:36,760
That's all I have

331
00:36:37,048 --> 00:36:38,846
Nothing else

332
00:37:54,174 --> 00:37:55,606
Don't win!

333
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:44,412
With those additions,
we're in business

334
00:38:44,537 --> 00:38:47,005
You'll get top marks

335
00:38:47,217 --> 00:38:49,890
I wouldn't know.
I had to come out

336
00:38:50,017 --> 00:38:51,848
You're too sensitive

337
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:56,411
But you know what you want

338
00:38:56,618 --> 00:39:02,329
I've brought bits from a new film.
I'd like your advice

339
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,927
We'll look at them later

340
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,896
Leave it with me

341
00:39:13,978 --> 00:39:15,537
Do you know her?

342
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:20,096
She's got a lot of pull.
Do you know who's screwing her?

343
00:39:23,179 --> 00:39:25,739
This is a load of shit!

344
00:39:25,939 --> 00:39:30,410
That freak! He was thrown out of
film school in the first year

345
00:39:32,819 --> 00:39:35,697
He'll boo the verdict,
you'll see

346
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,414
How did you get those pigeons?

347
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,499
They just happened to be there,
so I filmed them

348
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:47,011
What an idea!

349
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:51,048
You just film what's there?

350
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,010
- Well, yes
- I like that

351
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:57,772
How about first names?

352
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:02,253
- Czeslaw!
- Filip

353
00:40:03,062 --> 00:40:05,940
Let me introduce the jury

354
00:40:06,381 --> 00:40:09,419
Anna Wlodarczyk,
from our Federation

355
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:11,578
Teresa Smigielowna, actress

356
00:40:11,782 --> 00:40:14,740
Andrzej Jurga, Warsaw Television

357
00:40:14,862 --> 00:40:18,094
Tadeusz Sobolewski,
The Weekly Film

358
00:40:18,303 --> 00:40:23,013
Stanislaw Niemiaszek, representing
the Trade Unions

359
00:40:23,143 --> 00:40:25,417
And myself, as chairman

360
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:29,260
I would like to recommend
for the award...

361
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:34,339
...The Jubileeby Filip Mosz,
from the Wielice Film Club

362
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:38,141
For its originality

363
00:40:38,383 --> 00:40:43,060
The way it captures the solemnity
of the occasion...

364
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:46,342
...while peering behind the scenes

365
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:50,259
People in private, pigeons
on the windowsill...

366
00:40:50,384 --> 00:40:53,456
...the actors being paid
backstage

367
00:40:53,864 --> 00:40:58,859
It shows great powers
of observation...

368
00:40:59,466 --> 00:41:03,219
...and reflects an interesting
modern approach...

369
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:05,536
...to film narrative

370
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:10,183
- Isn't it his first film?
- Yes, it is

371
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:12,741
It'd be a shame to spoil...

372
00:41:12,986 --> 00:41:16,661
...such a promising young
film-maker

373
00:41:16,786 --> 00:41:20,256
He isn't that young.
Let's see you...

374
00:41:20,507 --> 00:41:21,939
...Mr. Mosz

375
00:41:40,987 --> 00:41:43,421
My fellow jurors...

376
00:41:44,388 --> 00:41:48,347
...have spoken very eloquently
of the films shown

377
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:53,666
They talk of "social commitment",
"modern narrative"...

378
00:41:53,788 --> 00:41:56,143
...and "documentation of the times"

379
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:59,021
But I saw nothing of the sort

380
00:42:00,509 --> 00:42:02,022
These films...

381
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,827
...were all terrible

382
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:09,546
They reveal a knowledge of life
drawn from TV and newsreels

383
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:11,819
Not from personal experience

384
00:42:12,069 --> 00:42:17,098
It is the duty of television
to broadcast certain things

385
00:42:17,749 --> 00:42:19,900
Amateurs have no such duty

386
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:23,182
You can do what you like

387
00:42:23,391 --> 00:42:26,269
That's where your strength lies

388
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,787
I can't believe your life
consists solely of meetings...

389
00:42:32,071 --> 00:42:35,188
...ovations, presentations...

390
00:42:35,431 --> 00:42:39,709
...parades and civil defence
exercises

391
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:44,304
On the other hand, I'm sure
you could make films...

392
00:42:44,752 --> 00:42:46,822
...about yourselves...

393
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:52,022
...and about your workmates
who really work hard...

394
00:42:52,272 --> 00:42:54,503
...to keep us all fed

395
00:42:54,793 --> 00:42:56,703
My colleague has got carried away

396
00:42:56,952 --> 00:43:01,504
We're here to give awards to films,
not to make speeches

397
00:43:01,752 --> 00:43:05,109
That's precisely my point

398
00:43:07,393 --> 00:43:10,386
These films don't deserve
an award

399
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:13,904
I propose this festival
gives none

400
00:43:18,834 --> 00:43:23,147
The jury has decided not
to award the Grand Prix

401
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:31,069
The second prize and

402
00:43:31,315 --> 00:43:34,546
...Stanislaw Miklosz for
The Verdict

403
00:43:38,836 --> 00:43:43,955
The third prize and 4,000 zlotys
go to Filip Mosz...

404
00:43:44,196 --> 00:43:46,584
...for The Jubilee

405
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:08,552
Anna says you have
something to show me

406
00:44:08,677 --> 00:44:10,110
If I may

407
00:44:41,959 --> 00:44:47,353
- That's all there is
- The idea is good

408
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:52,754
- Taken from the roof of the plant?
- No, from my balcony at home

409
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:56,116
Why only overhead shots?

410
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:00,319
Yes, I suppose it's monotonous

411
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,557
My wife won't let me film
outside

412
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,792
She's done you a favour

413
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:11,475
The only way to do it is
from one angle overhead

414
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:17,753
It'll win you all the top prizes

415
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:19,077
Let's hope so

416
00:45:21,762 --> 00:45:26,756
I must go. I want to buy
a heater for my flat

417
00:45:27,242 --> 00:45:31,202
- It gets very cold in the winter
- 'Bye. Thank you

418
00:45:31,443 --> 00:45:34,321
- Good luck, Mr. Mosz
- Thank you

419
00:45:35,762 --> 00:45:40,154
- Everybody's gone
- Will you buy me a coffee?

420
00:45:40,283 --> 00:45:44,640
Whatever you like. I've never
earned so much in my life

421
00:45:45,403 --> 00:45:47,359
Know who was right today?

422
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:49,998
Jurga?

423
00:45:51,843 --> 00:45:55,553
Yes, those films were bad.
Including yours

424
00:45:56,124 --> 00:45:58,592
You don't have to tell me

425
00:46:01,444 --> 00:46:04,163
Why did you vote for it?

426
00:46:04,364 --> 00:46:08,358
To encourage you to go on.
It's important for me

427
00:46:09,804 --> 00:46:13,161
I know so little about you

428
00:46:13,365 --> 00:46:15,276
What exactly do you do?

429
00:46:16,765 --> 00:46:18,596
I'm a buyer

430
00:46:19,245 --> 00:46:23,524
I travel a lot in Poland
buying supplies for the plant

431
00:46:23,766 --> 00:46:25,676
It's not bad work

432
00:46:29,886 --> 00:46:32,036
What about you?

433
00:46:46,726 --> 00:46:47,727
Me?

434
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:52,922
I get by. Doing quite nicely

435
00:46:54,928 --> 00:46:56,645
Know what they call me?

436
00:46:59,048 --> 00:47:02,085
The Amateur. And they're right

437
00:47:03,928 --> 00:47:07,204
I've never been able
to settle down

438
00:47:07,328 --> 00:47:10,560
I can't commit myself to
anyone or anything

439
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,359
Time to say goodbye, Filip

440
00:47:19,929 --> 00:47:22,318
But we'll meet again?

441
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,602
We'll see

442
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,810
Yes

443
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:18,651
- I'm blending her food
- You'll wake her up

444
00:48:19,453 --> 00:48:23,207
I'm sorry. Look, all creamy!

445
00:48:26,654 --> 00:48:27,688
What's wrong?

446
00:48:29,174 --> 00:48:30,367
Irena...

447
00:48:32,974 --> 00:48:34,930
What did you shout
at the station?

448
00:48:36,373 --> 00:48:38,330
That you were not to win

449
00:48:39,894 --> 00:48:45,527
Glad you're here, Stefan.
There are quite a few of us now

450
00:48:45,774 --> 00:48:49,814
One thing the festival
has taught me...

451
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,444
...is to stop filming jubilees

452
00:48:52,655 --> 00:48:55,215
- You got a prize though
- So?

453
00:48:55,415 --> 00:48:57,646
We need a different approach

454
00:48:57,776 --> 00:49:00,130
We should make films
about people

455
00:49:00,256 --> 00:49:03,646
About our feelings,
our own experiences

456
00:49:08,976 --> 00:49:10,455
Yes, Stasiu

457
00:49:12,456 --> 00:49:13,855
Right now?

458
00:49:14,696 --> 00:49:17,051
The boss has invited us round

459
00:49:18,577 --> 00:49:22,047
They also gave me a diploma, sir

460
00:49:23,296 --> 00:49:25,936
Well done. Third prize

461
00:49:26,137 --> 00:49:30,096
Second, really, since there
was no first prize

462
00:49:31,377 --> 00:49:36,497
Now I can congratulate you
officially, Filip

463
00:49:37,018 --> 00:49:38,576
Can I keep the diploma?

464
00:49:40,858 --> 00:49:42,496
Yes, of course

465
00:49:43,618 --> 00:49:48,851
I planted this tree when my son
was born. He died when he was five

466
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:51,129
This one was for the girl

467
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:55,855
These apple trees... were
for the twins

468
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:59,293
You see, that's the way it goes

469
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:02,969
Good buyer, good film-maker.
Cheers!

470
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,174
No, thanks. I've got too much
to do. Well, what next?

471
00:50:07,299 --> 00:50:11,259
We're finishing the film
about that invention

472
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:16,852
That'll be two films for the plant.
Then we must make one for ourselves

473
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:20,768
- What do you mean?
- Well, not about the plant

474
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:24,052
- What about, then?
- Life

475
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:32,171
- What did he want?
- To know our plans

476
00:50:32,301 --> 00:50:35,134
- What did you say?
- I told him

477
00:50:35,261 --> 00:50:40,894
- Why did you give him the diploma?
- No use to me. Things will work out

478
00:50:41,022 --> 00:50:44,935
I've just had a word with
Mr. Osuch

479
00:50:45,142 --> 00:50:50,739
We'll let you do what you want.
But we must keep a record

480
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:53,741
We'll give you a copy of
the film

481
00:50:53,982 --> 00:50:57,531
We must have something in writing,
a sort of memo

482
00:50:57,662 --> 00:51:02,179
For instance: "I'm making a film
about such and such..."

483
00:51:02,303 --> 00:51:04,453
You mean a script?

484
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:06,295
Call it a script

485
00:51:12,544 --> 00:51:16,696
- Where were you?
- The boss asked us round

486
00:51:24,865 --> 00:51:27,220
Has the doctor seen her?

487
00:51:27,345 --> 00:51:28,379
He has

488
00:51:33,985 --> 00:51:35,623
Go away. Go!

489
00:51:42,586 --> 00:51:44,496
Slam it harder!

490
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:55,262
What's this key doing here?

491
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:56,859
It's a new one!

492
00:52:00,146 --> 00:52:03,219
Do you really want to know
about me?

493
00:52:34,508 --> 00:52:37,899
What have you done?
Clear it up!

494
00:52:44,149 --> 00:52:46,709
Is that how it was in that film?

495
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:52,587
Have you gone mad?

496
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:04,503
For God's sake,
what's the matter?

497
00:53:08,031 --> 00:53:09,589
I don't know

498
00:53:13,231 --> 00:53:15,984
You wanted me and you got me

499
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:19,468
You wanted a daughter
and I gave you one

500
00:53:20,991 --> 00:53:23,267
You were meant to be happy

501
00:53:23,472 --> 00:53:26,544
- I am happy
- No, you're not

502
00:53:28,632 --> 00:53:31,066
I can see what's going on

503
00:53:32,753 --> 00:53:34,948
Will you let me explain?

504
00:53:37,072 --> 00:53:39,223
I did want all those things

505
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:41,389
And now I have them

506
00:53:43,913 --> 00:53:47,269
I'm really happy, honestly

507
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:53,222
Then came this film business

508
00:53:54,674 --> 00:53:57,188
You know how it happened

509
00:53:57,314 --> 00:53:58,952
I realised...

510
00:54:00,394 --> 00:54:06,265
...there could be things worth more
than peace and quiet

511
00:54:08,675 --> 00:54:12,031
That a man needs, thatln eed...

512
00:54:12,355 --> 00:54:14,949
...more than peace and quiet

513
00:54:16,155 --> 00:54:20,512
That some things can matter more
than a home and a family

514
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:22,748
What can that be?

515
00:54:23,276 --> 00:54:27,155
I don't know, but it can
matter more

516
00:54:29,116 --> 00:54:32,825
- Do you understand?
- More or less

517
00:54:34,116 --> 00:54:38,315
But so what? Everything's
coming apart

518
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:48,552
Piotrek's mother died,
on top of it all

519
00:54:50,798 --> 00:54:53,790
- When?
- This morning

520
00:55:06,479 --> 00:55:08,230
God, we're late

521
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,912
- Why are they waiting?
- Piotrek's not here

522
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,273
Piotrek hasn't come

523
00:55:56,842 --> 00:55:58,035
Piotrek!

524
00:56:29,403 --> 00:56:30,883
Boys...

525
00:56:31,883 --> 00:56:32,999
All over?

526
00:56:34,564 --> 00:56:35,565
Yes

527
00:56:37,364 --> 00:56:42,358
Can you show me the bit of film
you took that time?

528
00:56:43,765 --> 00:56:45,163
Piotrek...

529
00:56:46,645 --> 00:56:48,761
Why didn't you show up?

530
00:56:52,645 --> 00:56:54,124
I couldn't

531
00:56:54,245 --> 00:56:58,079
I couldn't watch her
being buried

532
00:57:06,285 --> 00:57:09,722
- What's wrong with him?
- Nothing

533
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,724
What did he say?

534
00:57:11,927 --> 00:57:15,601
He asked to see the film
Filip made

535
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:33,206
Can I keep the film?

536
00:58:33,891 --> 00:58:35,530
Yes, of course

537
00:58:41,772 --> 00:58:44,240
I admire what you're doing

538
00:58:46,532 --> 00:58:50,890
A person is dead, but
she lives on here

539
00:58:52,732 --> 00:58:54,325
That's beautiful

540
00:59:02,293 --> 00:59:03,772
What's this?

541
00:59:13,294 --> 00:59:15,330
Can I leave this order with you?

542
00:59:16,454 --> 00:59:18,888
We'll see what we can do

543
00:59:19,134 --> 00:59:22,605
I feel like going to the cinema.
What's on?

544
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:30,411
Camouflage, with Zanussi
discussing the film later

545
00:59:31,015 --> 00:59:33,529
- Where?
- In Freedom Square

546
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,772
I hope you deserve
my talking to you

547
00:59:37,896 --> 00:59:40,011
I act as I do...

548
00:59:40,736 --> 00:59:43,125
...because it's convenient

549
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:54,126
You can say I'm a cynic

550
00:59:55,376 --> 01:00:00,576
- That's obvious
- What's wrong with that?

551
01:00:03,697 --> 01:00:06,609
For you, or for other people?

552
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:09,047
For me, let's say

553
01:00:09,258 --> 01:00:12,011
As you may have guessed...

554
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:16,168
...I don't care much
for other people

555
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:23,018
- That's too bad
- In what way? Be more specific

556
01:00:27,098 --> 01:00:29,487
It would be pointless

557
01:00:30,018 --> 01:00:33,614
Your arguments are much
too sophisticated for me

558
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:38,887
Who's ducking the issue now?
We've changed roles

559
01:00:39,099 --> 01:00:43,092
I'd like to talk to you again

560
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,409
Meanwhile, if I were you...

561
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:50,930
...I'd keep a sharp look-out
for the rector

562
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:56,330
It's always a good idea to
be the first to greet him

563
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,332
Don't you think a film...

564
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:10,618
...about a successful man...

565
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:13,057
...would have more impact?

566
01:01:13,261 --> 01:01:17,255
If I could create a character
in a universal mould...

567
01:01:17,382 --> 01:01:21,853
...I'd make a film about him,
and no doubt I will one day

568
01:01:22,102 --> 01:01:25,379
I made this film because I feel...

569
01:01:25,582 --> 01:01:30,338
...that the odds in the world today
are against honest people

570
01:01:30,463 --> 01:01:32,100
They seldom succeed

571
01:01:32,342 --> 01:01:37,098
Too many of them fall
by the wayside

572
01:01:37,343 --> 01:01:41,132
Is it enough for a director
to believe...

573
01:01:41,383 --> 01:01:43,180
...he's telling the truth?

574
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:47,337
Or should he try to verify it?

575
01:01:49,144 --> 01:01:53,695
He must. And there lies
our eternal dilemma

576
01:01:53,824 --> 01:01:59,741
Wondering if what we're saying
is objectively true, or wise...

577
01:01:59,865 --> 01:02:04,814
...without being able to specify
how it can be tested

578
01:02:05,065 --> 01:02:09,217
Each of us hopes that his film
will help someone

579
01:02:09,345 --> 01:02:11,859
That it will change society

580
01:02:11,985 --> 01:02:13,941
But let's face the facts

581
01:02:14,065 --> 01:02:18,025
We are no longer alchemists
of the soul...

582
01:02:18,146 --> 01:02:21,502
...capable of changing the world

583
01:02:21,985 --> 01:02:24,261
Criteria are relative

584
01:02:24,386 --> 01:02:27,105
There are no hard and fast rules

585
01:02:27,346 --> 01:02:31,544
We don't know. And this uncertainty
is our strength

586
01:02:31,786 --> 01:02:36,019
It's what drives us to say things
over and over again

587
01:02:36,147 --> 01:02:39,776
Differently, more tellingly,
more precisely

588
01:02:40,067 --> 01:02:44,140
- Did you study another subject?
- Physics

589
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:48,787
- Is it true what you said?
- At what point?

590
01:02:48,988 --> 01:02:51,023
What you said about films

591
01:02:51,227 --> 01:02:54,026
Yes, though it's more complicated

592
01:02:54,308 --> 01:02:57,186
But basically I meant what I said

593
01:02:57,588 --> 01:03:01,217
Would you visit us in Wielice?

594
01:03:01,749 --> 01:03:04,866
- Where is it?
- Near Cracow

595
01:03:05,069 --> 01:03:10,097
We've an amateur film club.
They'd like to hear you speak

596
01:03:10,669 --> 01:03:15,697
Why don't you call me?
I'll come if I can

597
01:03:28,030 --> 01:03:31,420
Can I haveFilma ndPolityka?

598
01:03:39,391 --> 01:03:41,347
Any kind of razor blades,
please

599
01:04:16,073 --> 01:04:20,828
- I met Zanussi. I talked to him
- And what?

600
01:04:21,753 --> 01:04:24,028
He said he'd come to our club

601
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:29,144
He explained why he makes films

602
01:04:29,554 --> 01:04:30,828
Why?

603
01:04:32,834 --> 01:04:36,191
I can't say. It's difficult

604
01:04:37,914 --> 01:04:41,624
Know what? I feel good
when you're here

605
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:59,630
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm sorry, sir

606
01:05:00,156 --> 01:05:01,508
I'd like to know...

607
01:05:01,755 --> 01:05:03,235
...what's going on

608
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:07,509
It's in the script. A film about
an old worker of merit

609
01:05:09,236 --> 01:05:11,625
Couldn't it be someone else?

610
01:05:11,876 --> 01:05:13,151
Why him?

611
01:05:13,717 --> 01:05:18,313
Perhaps because it's harder
for him to work well

612
01:05:18,517 --> 01:05:22,305
Very clever! But a bit dishonest

613
01:05:22,557 --> 01:05:23,706
Why?

614
01:05:24,237 --> 01:05:26,990
Making a cripple the subject

615
01:05:27,637 --> 01:05:31,756
You're using him
to make fun of him

616
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:33,151
No, we're not!

617
01:05:33,398 --> 01:05:34,797
Sir, wait till...

618
01:05:35,038 --> 01:05:36,517
...you see the film

619
01:05:38,478 --> 01:05:40,753
Was that all right, Mr. Mosz?

620
01:05:40,998 --> 01:05:42,590
Yes, thank you

621
01:05:42,838 --> 01:05:44,716
Very good, Mr. Wawrzyniec

622
01:05:45,198 --> 01:05:49,158
You won't be showing this
at any film festival

623
01:05:51,558 --> 01:05:54,027
- Did you do it?
- Yes

624
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:59,428
Warsaw on the line!
Booth No. 1

625
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,114
Hello? Yes, this is Filip Mosz

626
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:07,198
What a surprise! I've been
thinking about you

627
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,356
Anything the matter?

628
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,632
No, I just felt like calling you

629
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:16,040
No reason

630
01:06:16,241 --> 01:06:17,275
I'm glad

631
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:19,834
- Honestly?
- Honestly

632
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,360
So am I

633
01:06:21,841 --> 01:06:25,470
- Doing anything?
- You mean a film?

634
01:06:25,682 --> 01:06:29,117
Yes. It's about this man...

635
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:33,280
...who has worked in our plant
for 25 years

636
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:37,920
You'll have to see it.
It sounds silly over the phone

637
01:06:50,803 --> 01:06:52,031
Filip?

638
01:06:53,883 --> 01:06:56,078
- Is something wrong?
- No

639
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:59,794
I just saw... my wife

640
01:07:00,643 --> 01:07:03,283
- She was standing there
- So?

641
01:07:03,763 --> 01:07:06,119
- She's gone
- Run after her

642
01:07:09,524 --> 01:07:12,038
- Are you running?
- No

643
01:07:31,725 --> 01:07:34,797
What do you do in your
spare time?

644
01:07:35,005 --> 01:07:37,566
We stay at home

645
01:07:37,805 --> 01:07:40,956
My wife cooks dinner

646
01:07:44,246 --> 01:07:46,316
We play rummy...

647
01:07:46,967 --> 01:07:52,724
- Do you ever go out?
- Sometimes we go to the cinema

648
01:07:53,287 --> 01:07:57,803
A cafe, more often.
Especially on Sundays

649
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:01,598
My wife likes fruit jellies

650
01:08:01,847 --> 01:08:04,645
I haven't much of a sweet tooth

651
01:08:04,888 --> 01:08:09,358
One way or another,
we pass the time

652
01:08:13,608 --> 01:08:15,917
- When will you be back?
- Don't shout

653
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:23,287
It's my sister's Saint's Day

654
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:25,527
Damn, I forgot

655
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:30,447
So what if that's not where
I'm going?

656
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35,567
Don't worry. I'll say hello
from you

657
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,565
They've taken all the ladders

658
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:55,445
The train to Katowice
will arrive in ten minutes

659
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:03,523
We invite you to come to our
cinema on Thursday at 4 p.m...

660
01:09:03,651 --> 01:09:05,642
...to see Camouflage...

661
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,850
...followed by a discussion with
the distinguished professor...

662
01:09:09,971 --> 01:09:13,089
...and film director,
Krisztof Zanussi

663
01:09:15,131 --> 01:09:18,647
The showing is at 4 o'clock.
The film is Camouflage

664
01:09:18,892 --> 01:09:21,964
It will finish at 5.45 p.m.

665
01:09:22,172 --> 01:09:26,724
He's due at 5. Maybe he should
have coffee with the director

666
01:09:27,732 --> 01:09:31,931
No, Stasiu. We want to show him
the club and my film

667
01:09:32,173 --> 01:09:36,212
And the audience? I expect
about 100

668
01:09:36,414 --> 01:09:40,725
- Go on! With 20 posters in town!
- And the announcement

669
01:09:40,853 --> 01:09:44,050
We'll need extra chairs,
you'll see

670
01:09:56,214 --> 01:09:59,126
Zanussi is coming tomorrow

671
01:09:59,254 --> 01:10:02,611
Will you come? I want to
show him my films

672
01:10:02,735 --> 01:10:05,568
I hear you slapped posters
all over town

673
01:10:18,336 --> 01:10:20,770
- I'll get Wiesia to baby-sit
- She can't

674
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:26,933
- Will you come?
- And you'll mind the baby?

675
01:10:33,736 --> 01:10:36,204
- What are you looking for?
- I've found it

676
01:10:36,336 --> 01:10:40,649
- Why do you need that shirt?
- You want me to look like a tramp?

677
01:10:41,698 --> 01:10:44,131
- I'll wash it
- Don't bother

678
01:10:55,818 --> 01:11:00,529
This is a friend from the club,
filming for the first time today

679
01:11:02,538 --> 01:11:04,256
A girl I work with

680
01:11:05,379 --> 01:11:09,736
With these everywhere, we should
get a good turnout

681
01:11:09,939 --> 01:11:12,658
Shall we go into the club?

682
01:11:21,340 --> 01:11:25,572
People seem to like us. I get on
well with everyone at work

683
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,536
Does he work here in the plant?

684
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,008
Yes, he does

685
01:11:31,821 --> 01:11:33,890
Full-time. For 25 years

686
01:11:34,541 --> 01:11:36,132
He's retiring soon

687
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,574
My relations with the management
are very good

688
01:11:43,301 --> 01:11:46,338
I've received a few important
awards

689
01:11:47,662 --> 01:11:51,859
Worker of Merit, for instance

690
01:11:52,061 --> 01:11:55,054
A watch... they seem to value me

691
01:12:03,702 --> 01:12:04,737
That's it

692
01:12:06,463 --> 01:12:08,658
I like the idea

693
01:12:08,943 --> 01:12:12,458
A man who finds things
harder than others

694
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:16,935
That's how I see it.
But everyone says...

695
01:12:17,183 --> 01:12:19,378
...I'm making fun of a cripple

696
01:12:19,503 --> 01:12:21,972
You're not making fun of anyone

697
01:12:22,184 --> 01:12:24,140
Who funds you?

698
01:12:24,384 --> 01:12:25,532
The plant

699
01:12:26,183 --> 01:12:27,936
They vet the scripts!

700
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:33,257
Someone has to approve the scripts.
Mine too

701
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:38,501
Do you know Jurga at TV?

702
01:12:38,864 --> 01:12:41,253
Have you been in touch with him?

703
01:12:41,384 --> 01:12:45,219
No, nobody has seen the film yet

704
01:12:45,825 --> 01:12:48,293
Why don't you write to him?

705
01:12:51,545 --> 01:12:53,775
This is our director

706
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:58,261
This is Mr. Zanussi, sir

707
01:12:59,466 --> 01:13:01,422
Pleased to meet you

708
01:13:03,266 --> 01:13:05,382
What have you been watching?

709
01:13:05,507 --> 01:13:07,656
Mr. Mosz showed me his films

710
01:13:07,946 --> 01:13:11,303
The one about the cripple
is interesting

711
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:14,745
I thought I'd made myself clear,
Mr. Mosz

712
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:18,826
- May I invite you to my office?
- It's a bit late

713
01:13:18,947 --> 01:13:22,019
- Just a small welcome
- People are waiting

714
01:13:22,867 --> 01:13:26,177
- Have you seen Irena?
- I haven't

715
01:13:30,468 --> 01:13:35,258
Does a Mosz live here? A telegram.
Sign here, please

716
01:13:36,148 --> 01:13:39,265
- I have no change
- Don't worry

717
01:13:51,149 --> 01:13:55,462
I thought it was for me.
It had only the surname

718
01:13:55,710 --> 01:13:59,066
"Letter received. Will call
Thursday, Jurga"

719
01:14:00,109 --> 01:14:01,384
I've read it

720
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:08,426
- Is she the girl you rang?
- Who?

721
01:14:09,550 --> 01:14:10,550
Jurga!

722
01:14:10,630 --> 01:14:14,987
Jurga is a man, and he's bald.
He selects amateur films for TV

723
01:14:16,271 --> 01:14:18,465
- What's today?
- Wednesday

724
01:14:18,671 --> 01:14:21,310
It's Thursday tomorrow.
I'll wash up

725
01:14:21,431 --> 01:14:23,821
No, thanks. Go on reading

726
01:14:25,671 --> 01:14:28,868
This is Jurga. Zanussi told me
you've got something new

727
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,505
Yes, I showed him

728
01:14:30,631 --> 01:14:35,262
I'm doing a programme on amateurs.
I want to see your new film

729
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:39,510
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, very well

730
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,065
Good

731
01:14:41,192 --> 01:14:45,152
I've finished the film
you saw at the festival

732
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:47,992
The one Zanussi mentioned

733
01:14:48,113 --> 01:14:50,502
And I'm working on a new project

734
01:14:50,633 --> 01:14:53,591
When will it be ready?

735
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:59,190
- In about a month
- OK. But no later

736
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:01,265
What's the new film about?

737
01:15:01,913 --> 01:15:03,347
An outing

738
01:15:03,594 --> 01:15:05,744
- A work outing
- What?

739
01:15:05,874 --> 01:15:06,989
An outing!

740
01:15:07,114 --> 01:15:09,230
Good. See you soon

741
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:12,069
Thank you. Goodbye

742
01:15:14,994 --> 01:15:16,872
Why are you yelling?

743
01:15:17,115 --> 01:15:20,993
- It's a good line
- I don't know. He started

744
01:15:22,075 --> 01:15:24,873
What outing were you
talking about?

745
01:15:25,475 --> 01:15:29,070
We want to film the trip
to Ojcow and Auschwitz

746
01:15:29,716 --> 01:15:33,344
- A documentary
- Good idea

747
01:15:34,836 --> 01:15:37,396
I might go with you

748
01:15:43,076 --> 01:15:44,794
Lucky the boss didn't come

749
01:15:45,037 --> 01:15:47,471
We've got ourselves a film!

750
01:15:47,597 --> 01:15:51,670
- When you shot those bottles...
- Were you scared?

751
01:15:51,917 --> 01:15:52,986
Yes

752
01:15:53,277 --> 01:15:54,790
Don't worry

753
01:15:55,757 --> 01:16:00,069
We'll get the sack. I'm sure

754
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:05,955
In Kafka, this bus would
fly over the fields...

755
01:16:06,718 --> 01:16:08,674
...and no one would get out

756
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:12,150
- But it won't?
- Probably not, Witek

757
01:16:33,999 --> 01:16:37,390
Shit! I'm scared, Witek

758
01:16:37,880 --> 01:16:42,396
You'll manage. If I were going,
I'd never come back

759
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,520
Look!

760
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,393
Shit, you're in for some journey

761
01:17:10,281 --> 01:17:12,876
I'm worried about you, Mr. Mosz

762
01:17:13,082 --> 01:17:14,310
Why?

763
01:17:15,602 --> 01:17:17,558
You could be heading for a fall

764
01:17:19,682 --> 01:17:22,151
But you know what I'm doing

765
01:17:22,283 --> 01:17:25,911
Of course. You don't fool me

766
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:29,080
- You're on your way to the TV?
- Yes

767
01:17:29,202 --> 01:17:33,082
- What are you taking them?
- Everything

768
01:17:34,123 --> 01:17:35,397
The dwarf as well?

769
01:17:37,724 --> 01:17:42,319
Yes. I want to showthem
what things are like in our plant

770
01:17:44,124 --> 01:17:49,403
Let me tell you, then.
We're buying a new camera

771
01:17:51,044 --> 01:17:54,354
- A bit bigger than yours
- 16mm?

772
01:17:55,284 --> 01:17:59,961
Yes. The girl from the Federation
helped me

773
01:18:01,045 --> 01:18:03,036
She's very fond of you

774
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:23,076
I thought I recognised Pieczka
in the hall

775
01:18:23,206 --> 01:18:25,561
The doorman wouldn't let him in!

776
01:18:26,206 --> 01:18:28,561
Did you bring all your films?

777
01:18:28,686 --> 01:18:31,406
The three I mentioned
on the phone

778
01:18:31,526 --> 01:18:33,677
Are they finished?

779
01:18:33,807 --> 01:18:37,083
I was up all night editing them

780
01:18:37,288 --> 01:18:42,315
Just a second. Our Current Affairs
producer would like a word with you

781
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:53,767
Mr. Mosz, Mr. Kedzierski
from Current Affairs

782
01:18:53,968 --> 01:18:56,324
I think we should sit down

783
01:18:56,928 --> 01:18:59,159
- You'll see me there?
- Of course

784
01:19:11,209 --> 01:19:16,158
Mr. Mosz, we've had
the following idea

785
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:19,962
We want to do some features...

786
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:23,400
...on small towns and
their inhabitants

787
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:31,087
We're interested in culture, housing,
community schemes, and so on

788
01:19:31,290 --> 01:19:36,240
You've already done our town
on television

789
01:19:36,451 --> 01:19:38,840
Onlt's a Knock-Out

790
01:19:39,891 --> 01:19:42,246
That's even better

791
01:19:43,052 --> 01:19:46,600
We go back to the town
after a year

792
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:49,405
How does it look today?

793
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:53,804
Which of the then future plans
have come to fruition?

794
01:19:54,492 --> 01:19:56,608
You want me to do that?

795
01:19:57,052 --> 01:20:01,569
No harm in trying. At first,
just short reports

796
01:20:02,332 --> 01:20:06,292
We'll supply the film.
You've got a 16mm camera?

797
01:20:08,452 --> 01:20:09,453
Yes, I have

798
01:20:09,653 --> 01:20:12,690
Good. Come back after
you've seen Jurga

799
01:20:17,614 --> 01:20:20,731
- Is the material here?
- Yes

800
01:20:20,933 --> 01:20:23,084
I'll be back in the evening

801
01:20:41,015 --> 01:20:42,289
Very good

802
01:20:43,175 --> 01:20:47,487
Was it all your own idea,
Mr. Mosz?

803
01:20:48,336 --> 01:20:53,045
- No help from the wife?
- No, it was mine

804
01:20:53,776 --> 01:20:58,008
The outing is a bit overdone

805
01:20:58,936 --> 01:21:02,292
Drunks and Auschwitz...
it's too strong

806
01:21:03,977 --> 01:21:08,766
I'll buy the pavement. But you
must let me have the dwarf

807
01:21:08,977 --> 01:21:11,616
The boss isn't too keen

808
01:21:11,737 --> 01:21:14,774
He's forbiddem me to show it

809
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:21,165
But it's not just about the plant.
It's a broader issue

810
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:26,257
- Well, yes or no?
- Yes

811
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,891
Doing business with Kedzierski?

812
01:21:37,138 --> 01:21:40,096
You know, for that TV show...

813
01:21:40,539 --> 01:21:44,976
...they did up the front of the town.
The back remained as it was

814
01:21:45,179 --> 01:21:50,048
Here's your stock.
Film whatever you want

815
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,248
I'll take only what suits me

816
01:21:59,860 --> 01:22:02,658
- Does that seem cynical?
- No

817
01:22:04,180 --> 01:22:06,136
Itisc ynical

818
01:22:06,701 --> 01:22:10,659
A film director once joked
that he was a civil servant

819
01:22:10,780 --> 01:22:12,737
Actually... he was right

820
01:22:22,302 --> 01:22:25,817
Give me 25 minutes, OK?

821
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,420
A nut-case. You know him?

822
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:32,778
Yes. I've met him

823
01:22:32,982 --> 01:22:37,498
He was at the festival. Throwing
bits of film all over the place

824
01:22:37,943 --> 01:22:40,297
Maybe you'd like to be an artist?

825
01:22:40,543 --> 01:22:43,774
- I don't think so
- Thank God!

826
01:22:50,984 --> 01:22:53,703
Ania? It's Filip

827
01:22:54,144 --> 01:22:56,578
Could we meet? I'm in town

828
01:22:58,103 --> 01:23:02,222
What a pity! Can I call you
some other time?

829
01:23:02,704 --> 01:23:03,704
Yes, OK

830
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:43,901
Hello

831
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:48,181
- Where is the baby?
- With my mother

832
01:23:54,747 --> 01:23:55,975
What's going on?

833
01:23:58,227 --> 01:24:01,185
Nothing. Did you bring a present?

834
01:24:01,428 --> 01:24:05,706
- What's going on?
- I told you. Nothing

835
01:24:09,308 --> 01:24:10,821
I'm moving to mother's

836
01:24:13,828 --> 01:24:16,103
- Where's the kid?
- Which kid?

837
01:24:16,348 --> 01:24:20,308
- How many do I have?
- When did we last make love?

838
01:24:21,069 --> 01:24:23,185
- Six months ago
- Five

839
01:24:23,429 --> 01:24:24,782
I'm five months pregnant

840
01:24:26,309 --> 01:24:28,345
- Shall I call him?
- No

841
01:24:28,469 --> 01:24:29,469
Who?

842
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:31,983
A friend

843
01:24:32,629 --> 01:24:35,428
A friend! That's what's going on

844
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,149
No, not that

845
01:24:49,910 --> 01:24:52,266
You've broken her toys

846
01:24:55,351 --> 01:25:00,471
Why now? When things are finally
working out for me

847
01:25:01,151 --> 01:25:03,585
When I'm beginning to understand
what this shitty life is about

848
01:25:06,511 --> 01:25:08,900
I did it for you two

849
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:13,064
Why now?

850
01:25:14,352 --> 01:25:17,390
- I want something else
- What?

851
01:25:17,593 --> 01:25:20,585
What we both wanted
at the beginning

852
01:25:20,713 --> 01:25:23,466
A bit of peace and quiet

853
01:25:24,273 --> 01:25:26,787
Rubbish! You just don't love me

854
01:25:29,153 --> 01:25:31,064
I wish I didn't

855
01:25:35,514 --> 01:25:36,788
What's that?

856
01:25:38,274 --> 01:25:39,753
Go away!

857
01:26:11,515 --> 01:26:14,826
"Your film will be shown
on television...

858
01:26:15,076 --> 01:26:17,352
"...next Saturday. Regards, Jurga".

859
01:26:23,916 --> 01:26:27,226
I told you you'd be all right

860
01:26:27,997 --> 01:26:30,191
There's more to come

861
01:26:30,437 --> 01:26:32,712
I'm now working for them...

862
01:26:34,917 --> 01:26:37,477
...on a follow-up to that TV show

863
01:26:38,598 --> 01:26:39,871
Look at that

864
01:26:41,998 --> 01:26:45,785
Beautiful! Know what it is?
A zoom lens

865
01:26:46,718 --> 01:26:50,711
Look, you screw it on like this...

866
01:26:54,439 --> 01:26:56,349
You put the hood on...

867
01:26:56,599 --> 01:27:00,558
- How much does it cost?
- 16,000 zlotys

868
01:27:00,759 --> 01:27:03,068
Shit, that's amazing!

869
01:27:04,599 --> 01:27:06,396
Now I zoom in...

870
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:11,199
Like the professionals, man!

871
01:27:11,399 --> 01:27:14,197
- Look, the hearse!
- Piotrek!

872
01:27:25,080 --> 01:27:28,517
It's three months
since he went away

873
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:34,197
Well, let's get cracking

874
01:27:38,121 --> 01:27:40,681
I hope no one interferes

875
01:27:49,362 --> 01:27:51,000
Lead me!

876
01:28:13,563 --> 01:28:15,634
That was terrific

877
01:28:16,763 --> 01:28:18,322
Isn't it awful here?

878
01:28:20,204 --> 01:28:23,913
Look! Here she is in a long shot

879
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:26,516
And in close-up

880
01:28:26,884 --> 01:28:31,879
In order for it to match,
I'll have to edit it

881
01:28:32,644 --> 01:28:35,238
That kid of yours is pretty

882
01:28:47,206 --> 01:28:49,162
When you edit this...

883
01:28:50,246 --> 01:28:54,205
...remember that when a long shot
is followed by a close-up...

884
01:28:54,406 --> 01:28:58,797
...the subject must face
the same way. Understand?

885
01:29:07,847 --> 01:29:10,441
It's starting!
I'll pour the drinks

886
01:29:11,847 --> 01:29:15,806
I'd like to show you a film by
Filip Mosz of Wielice

887
01:29:16,047 --> 01:29:19,596
He told me he started
the club himself...

888
01:29:19,847 --> 01:29:24,968
...thanks to the council and
management at his work

889
01:29:33,529 --> 01:29:39,081
26 years have passed since
I came to work here

890
01:29:39,329 --> 01:29:43,481
It just so happens that
I love my work

891
01:29:44,809 --> 01:29:47,607
I've never been late...

892
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:54,207
...or missed a single day's work
in all these years

893
01:29:54,930 --> 01:29:57,728
Things were rough at first

894
01:29:57,850 --> 01:30:00,808
My first pay packet consisted...

895
01:30:01,050 --> 01:30:04,885
...of 500 zlotys. Later
it went up to 720

896
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:09,404
Things are all right now

897
01:30:09,610 --> 01:30:15,368
I've just had an increase
of 400 zlotys

898
01:30:15,611 --> 01:30:17,408
Clearly, I'm appreciated

899
01:30:21,451 --> 01:30:23,124
On Sundays we sleep late

900
01:30:24,931 --> 01:30:29,130
My wife cooks lunch
and we play rummy

901
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:33,525
Sometimes we go to a cafe

902
01:30:33,773 --> 01:30:38,129
My wife has a sweet tooth
so she always has a jelly

903
01:30:38,372 --> 01:30:40,602
I'm not very fond of sweets

904
01:30:40,812 --> 01:30:43,043
But we get on, anyway

905
01:30:43,332 --> 01:30:45,767
We have a little chat

906
01:30:50,573 --> 01:30:54,533
People seem to like us, though
we're not from these parts

907
01:30:56,894 --> 01:30:59,692
Could you go to him, Mr. Mosz?

908
01:31:01,974 --> 01:31:06,843
It's been so long we feel
part of the family

909
01:31:08,694 --> 01:31:10,287
Are you all right?

910
01:31:12,254 --> 01:31:15,052
You've done it beautifully, Filip

911
01:31:15,735 --> 01:31:17,726
Really beautifully!

912
01:31:17,935 --> 01:31:21,086
I was so moved I had to come out

913
01:31:30,495 --> 01:31:35,570
I want you to knowthis is
only the beginning

914
01:31:35,776 --> 01:31:40,452
On Sunday you'll see another
of Filip's documentaries

915
01:31:40,656 --> 01:31:45,685
He's dragged everything out
into the open as it really is

916
01:31:45,896 --> 01:31:48,855
Here's to you, Mr. Wawrzyniec!

917
01:31:51,097 --> 01:31:53,816
Why has your wife left you?

918
01:31:54,938 --> 01:31:57,213
You're so famous now

919
01:31:58,777 --> 01:32:02,453
I don't know. She's probably right

920
01:32:03,378 --> 01:32:05,016
It was inevitable

921
01:32:05,138 --> 01:32:07,857
- Did she take the TV set?
- No

922
01:32:08,098 --> 01:32:10,976
I'm sure she'll come back

923
01:32:13,339 --> 01:32:15,330
Come on, Filip, sing!

924
01:32:27,419 --> 01:32:31,811
Hello, gate! You'll be on the box
on Sunday

925
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:39,180
Filip, you're so clever.
My God, how clever you are!

926
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:43,653
Six months ago you had nothing

927
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:47,217
Now you have everything

928
01:32:47,941 --> 01:32:52,332
- You make films. You're free
- In what way?

929
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:56,659
You're on your own. You've got rid
of Irenka and the kid

930
01:33:00,022 --> 01:33:02,216
You're so clever, Filip!

931
01:33:04,181 --> 01:33:08,653
They're beginning to showthe facts
on TV nowadays

932
01:33:08,862 --> 01:33:12,822
To think that first film on our town
was for TV too!

933
01:33:13,023 --> 01:33:14,660
It's the trend

934
01:33:15,663 --> 01:33:17,573
We all watched

935
01:33:17,782 --> 01:33:21,822
Kryska's mum lives there.
She almost dropped dead

936
01:33:22,023 --> 01:33:25,220
- Have a cheese sandwich
- Thanks

937
01:33:41,864 --> 01:33:45,698
As we were saying, Mosz.
We've got problems

938
01:33:47,665 --> 01:33:51,418
- Will you be in later, sir?
- In half an hour

939
01:34:01,665 --> 01:34:04,816
Stasiu, will you wait for me?

940
01:34:06,466 --> 01:34:08,184
All my life!

941
01:34:13,637 --> 01:34:15,594
He'll have to go

942
01:34:16,157 --> 01:34:18,672
- Who?
- Osuch

943
01:34:20,237 --> 01:34:23,274
Who's responsible for
cultural activities?

944
01:34:23,398 --> 01:34:26,868
- The Works Council. Osuch
- Oh, my God!

945
01:34:28,038 --> 01:34:30,393
We won't do anything drastic

946
01:34:30,598 --> 01:34:33,590
He just won't get re-elected

947
01:34:34,199 --> 01:34:36,154
He'll retire early

948
01:34:36,278 --> 01:34:40,431
Because of the film on the dwarf?
Or the documentary?

949
01:34:40,559 --> 01:34:44,677
The documentary, of course.
Though the dwarf didn't help

950
01:34:45,159 --> 01:34:48,993
Let me be responsible
for what I do

951
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:52,912
You're young. You can
make mistakes

952
01:34:53,120 --> 01:34:58,069
It wasn't a mistake, sir.
I did it because it's the truth

953
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:00,631
Come for a drive?

954
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:04,194
- Where to?
- Just a drive

955
01:35:16,041 --> 01:35:20,239
Sir, did you bring me here
to admire the view?

956
01:35:22,561 --> 01:35:26,874
Why are you sacking
an honest man?

957
01:35:27,082 --> 01:35:29,038
Because of my films?

958
01:35:29,242 --> 01:35:32,234
You didn't improve the back
of the buildings

959
01:35:32,362 --> 01:35:36,321
People can live in pigsties
as long as the front looks good

960
01:35:36,442 --> 01:35:40,402
For drunken outings and inviting
the artists, you're first in line

961
01:35:40,522 --> 01:35:45,233
But to give Wawrzyniec more than
a fruit jelly would be too much

962
01:35:45,363 --> 01:35:48,400
- Stop shouting
- I want to shout!

963
01:35:48,523 --> 01:35:51,196
Go on, then. I'm all ears

964
01:36:01,284 --> 01:36:03,320
You're sacking Osuch

965
01:36:04,044 --> 01:36:06,797
It's more serious than you think

966
01:36:07,444 --> 01:36:09,878
Osuch would retire anyway

967
01:36:12,324 --> 01:36:17,319
The works clerk and the architect
will have to go, too

968
01:36:17,565 --> 01:36:21,683
The money we received for
that TV competition...

969
01:36:21,885 --> 01:36:27,596
...was needed for other things
than to smarten up the town

970
01:36:27,805 --> 01:36:33,164
We had to rebuild the slaughterhouse.
And we needed a nursery school

971
01:36:33,406 --> 01:36:38,719
We started building it. But because
of your film, we'll have to stop

972
01:36:40,486 --> 01:36:45,003
Unfortunately, our needs and
what we are allocated...

973
01:36:45,127 --> 01:36:46,923
...don't tally

974
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:50,723
- But one can't voice these opinions
- Maybe

975
01:36:51,887 --> 01:36:55,926
Definitely. Community affairs...

976
01:36:56,167 --> 01:36:58,204
...can't always be made public

977
01:36:58,448 --> 01:37:01,326
Before opening your mouth...

978
01:37:01,448 --> 01:37:05,839
...you must think of the damage
you can do

979
01:37:06,088 --> 01:37:10,560
- You must be well informed
- I want to be. People ought to be

980
01:37:13,769 --> 01:37:15,839
They're not mature enough

981
01:37:16,089 --> 01:37:18,363
So it's back to square one

982
01:37:19,969 --> 01:37:23,006
I'm doing a doctorate
in economics

983
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:28,078
I've had to study law,
two languages, sociology...

984
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:30,845
One must be informed

985
01:37:31,049 --> 01:37:34,167
What's your next film about?

986
01:37:34,370 --> 01:37:36,930
The brickworks. It's good

987
01:37:37,650 --> 01:37:41,006
They haven't made a brick
for months

988
01:37:41,130 --> 01:37:43,086
I'll tell you why

989
01:37:43,290 --> 01:37:48,649
It's a small plant. Local supplies
of materials have run out

990
01:37:48,770 --> 01:37:52,764
But jobs must remain.
So the men are employed...

991
01:37:53,011 --> 01:37:54,683
...cleaning the town

992
01:37:54,811 --> 01:38:00,603
I know. But why build the factory
there in the first place?

993
01:38:10,892 --> 01:38:13,691
Have a look

994
01:38:14,932 --> 01:38:19,290
It's so simple. The world
can be beautiful

995
01:38:20,212 --> 01:38:23,046
People live and love

996
01:38:24,173 --> 01:38:26,164
You should look at that, too

997
01:38:27,213 --> 01:38:31,924
Your films are so bleak
and gloomy

998
01:38:38,094 --> 01:38:39,413
I see

999
01:38:40,094 --> 01:38:44,053
Only nature can be shown
as it really is

1000
01:38:46,494 --> 01:38:47,644
Maybe

1001
01:38:57,775 --> 01:39:00,892
- Is Witek in?
- No, just Mr. Osuch

1002
01:39:18,697 --> 01:39:21,769
Would you like some coffee?

1003
01:39:35,297 --> 01:39:36,936
What can I say?

1004
01:39:39,097 --> 01:39:42,647
Nothing. I know how you feel

1005
01:39:43,058 --> 01:39:48,610
I could tell you it's not
your fault, but I won't

1006
01:39:49,698 --> 01:39:53,533
The matter is far more serious

1007
01:39:54,338 --> 01:39:57,728
You must realise that
this will happen again

1008
01:39:57,979 --> 01:39:59,935
And you must carry on

1009
01:40:00,059 --> 01:40:04,018
If you feel you're right,
nothing else matters

1010
01:40:04,139 --> 01:40:08,178
You'll never know who
you're helping

1011
01:40:08,420 --> 01:40:10,535
Who you're working against

1012
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:15,859
Like you didn't know now.
You'll help some, harm others

1013
01:40:16,059 --> 01:40:19,132
You're sensitive,
so it'll be tough

1014
01:40:19,340 --> 01:40:22,537
But you must obey your instincts

1015
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:26,176
Something good has awoken in you

1016
01:40:26,621 --> 01:40:28,850
Hang on to it

1017
01:40:32,141 --> 01:40:34,530
I've grown very fond of you

1018
01:40:35,141 --> 01:40:37,258
I'm proud of you

1019
01:40:39,421 --> 01:40:42,573
We've all come to believe in you

1020
01:40:43,102 --> 01:40:46,060
You can't do anything for me

1021
01:40:46,422 --> 01:40:49,812
It's beyond you. Forget about it

1022
01:40:56,822 --> 01:40:58,814
Oh, here's Witek!

1023
01:40:59,502 --> 01:41:01,494
Witek, wait!

1024
01:41:09,743 --> 01:41:14,864
Witek, where's the film?
The one about the brickworks

1025
01:41:15,064 --> 01:41:17,020
I put it on the train

1026
01:41:17,144 --> 01:41:20,341
- What time does it leave?
- 3.30

1027
01:41:24,784 --> 01:41:26,536
Hey, there's a chain!

1028
01:41:28,904 --> 01:41:31,657
You'll have to sign a chit

1029
01:41:32,345 --> 01:41:35,621
- The one who sent it
- You sign it

1030
01:41:43,305 --> 01:41:47,457
- What did the boss tell you?
- Nothing

1031
01:42:03,987 --> 01:42:05,578
You'll expose it!

1032
01:42:07,467 --> 01:42:09,025
You'll ruin it!

1033
01:42:12,187 --> 01:42:14,747
Go on! Get it!

1034
01:42:17,787 --> 01:42:19,665
You've ruined it!

1035
01:42:34,028 --> 01:42:36,496
You stupid bastard!

1036
01:43:02,150 --> 01:43:04,506
You forgot to put out the bottle

1037
01:43:22,752 --> 01:43:25,744
- What's today?
- Sunday

1038
01:45:24,640 --> 01:45:27,200
She woke up at 4 in the morning

1039
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:29,752
I was eating bread

1040
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,869
That was a year ago

1041
01:45:33,760 --> 01:45:36,149
It must have hurt a lot

1042
01:45:36,360 --> 01:45:38,237
She was all wet

1043
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,635
I had to carry her

1044
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:44,276
I could hardly walk

1045
01:45:44,920 --> 01:45:48,470
I left her in the hospital

1046
01:45:49,361 --> 01:45:54,355
Some woman in labour screamed.
That frightened her

1047
01:45:56,202 --> 01:46:00,399
I walked up and down outside
the hospital for hours

1048
01:46:01,282 --> 01:46:07,039
Then she opened a window and
we talked, but not for long

1049
01:46:07,562 --> 01:46:10,838
In the morning I bought some vodka
and went to work
