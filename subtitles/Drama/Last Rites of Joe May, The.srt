1
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:26,802
Don't! Don't come!

2
00:00:26,803 --> 00:00:29,803
Death, that's what you want, isn't it?

3
00:00:29,852 --> 00:00:32,352
No! I don't want to die!

4
00:00:38,212 --> 00:00:39,852
You're my assistant aren't you?

5
00:00:39,852 --> 00:00:41,852
I'll die with you!

6
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:45,600
Let's go to heaven

7
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,833
where your mom and dad
are waiting for you

8
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,566
"Sakajo Ryotarou"

9
00:02:06,375 --> 00:02:07,836
Amane Misa

10
00:02:08,906 --> 00:02:11,710
Your life's been extended

11
00:02:17,973 --> 00:02:20,918
Are you an ... angel?

12
00:02:21,196 --> 00:02:23,809
No, I'm the Reaper

13
00:02:24,338 --> 00:02:25,746
The Reaper£¿

14
00:02:32,138 --> 00:02:33,592
Cool!

15
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:38,708
The human whose name is written in the note shall...

16
00:02:39,899 --> 00:02:40,899
die.

17
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:18,820
Akino SHiori was shot and killed by a woman at the museum

18
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:21,820
Misora Naomi, the murderer, also killed herself there

19
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Did they know each other?

20
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,820
I don't know

21
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,830
Yagami Light, the boy who saw it, was Shiori's boyfriend, wasn't he?

22
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:31,824
Were they involved in a love triangle?

23
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:34,814
That's enough! Where do you think you are!

24
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:37,756
Are you from their college? Can I ask you couple questions?

25
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,335
No, we're not!

26
00:04:39,336 --> 00:04:42,117
Ah, you're detectives! Then I want to ask some...

27
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:42,949
Get out of here!

28
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,652
The Police...?

29
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,379
I feel sorry for both Shiori and Light

30
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
Who said that Misora was an excellent FBI agent?

31
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,820
She was too obsessed with catching the one who killed her fiance

32
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,830
I don't understand why she suspected Light

33
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,800
They're here

34
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:18,820
Yagami Light

35
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,820
the hero of this tragedy who lost his girlfriend

36
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,820
His father is the director of the detective team

37
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,830
And his sister... must still be in high school

38
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,830
I heard Kira has something to do with this case

39
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,800
Don't say such nonsense

40
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,830
Kira didn't kill her

41
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:38,840
Light must be hurt by such a heartless rumor

42
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,810
You're right..

43
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:49,492
Everyone feels sorry for you, Light

44
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,408
Dad, I will avenge Shiori

45
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,779
Sorry, I didn't want you involved

46
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:22,848
I'll definitely make Kira pay

47
00:06:23,107 --> 00:06:25,014
You ARE the Kira, aren't you?

48
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,840
5 seconds!

49
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,810
Opening!

50
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:50,638
Good evening

51
00:06:51,427 --> 00:06:53,454
Welcome to Evening Spot, I'm Nishiyama Saeko

52
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,610
Nakayama Kiyohiko, who murdered a girl, just died of heart attack

53
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:05,393
Nakayama was wanted for murder

54
00:07:06,172 --> 00:07:11,525
But today in Shibuya he suddenly fell

55
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,325
and died of heart attack

56
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:19,490
Today was the 10th birthday of Aoki Takuma, the victim's brother

57
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:23,810
My sister asked Kira-sama from heaven to do this

58
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,820
I think this was a gift from her

59
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,830
Currently, L, the mysterious detective ICPO invited to investigate

60
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:43,320
has concluded that Kira lives in Kanto, Japan, but has not achieved any further result

61
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:10,497
This is Kira's handy work

62
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:16,454
The police has not admitted though

63
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,840
You must leave everything communication device, including mobile phone here

64
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,860
Ryuzaki, here is Mr. Yagami Light

65
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,830
Ryuzaki£¿

66
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,870
I see, a false name to protect you from Kira

67
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,870
You're so sharp. How did you see it?

68
00:09:35,870 --> 00:09:38,870
You can see it easily if you think of the cases logically

69
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,850
I've heard about your extraordinary ability

70
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,810
Not sure if they were being sarcastic..

71
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,499
I suspect you to be Kira

72
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,387
Are you joking?

73
00:09:58,387 --> 00:10:01,397
I don't like to joke

74
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:02,398
Then why did you invite such a dangerous person?

75
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,870
Because if I die, you'll be suspected the most

76
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,903
You mean, if you die, I'm Kira

77
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,880
How did you came up with that?

78
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,880
Our investigation status has leaked out to Kira

79
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,820
so I had the FBI team investigate our members and their family

80
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:21,282
including you, Light

81
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,596
I felt like someone's been following me

82
00:10:25,779 --> 00:10:27,779
As a result, we've lost

83
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,820
Every member of the team was killed. This is a shame

84
00:10:32,688 --> 00:10:35,688
But we succeeded in profiling the most suspicious person

85
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:39,988
out of the people we have investigated

86
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:41,371
You mean me?

87
00:10:41,331 --> 00:10:45,686
Yes, and we set cameras and taps in your room

88
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,850
That's illegal...!

89
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,265
Did my father agree too?

90
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,860
It was a special case

91
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,860
If so, it must've proved that I'm innocent

92
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,172
I bet you can outwit them easily

93
00:11:01,366 --> 00:11:05,809
Besides, Misora Naomi reached you although we didn't give her any information

94
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,355
Hey, Wait!

95
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:13,537
You're too mean... Light just lost his grilfriend!

96
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:15,326
because Misora Naomi killed her!

97
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,297
Kira can control the dying situations

98
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,820
You think that I controlled Shiori and Misora and killed them...

99
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,567
What for£¿

100
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,860
To make people feel sorry for you and to join our team

101
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:30,112
to approach me and...

102
00:11:29,913 --> 00:11:31,476
to kill me

103
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,870
You bastard!

104
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,164
You may have a superior intelligence, but you don't have a heart!

105
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:42,100
Mr. Matsuda, I can prove my innocence on my own

106
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:47,423
So, how do you thik I killed those people?

107
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,890
That's the only think I want to know

108
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:55,820
It will give the answer to every mystery

109
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:59,860
If all the mysteries were solved and it told that I'm Kira...

110
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:05,227
Unfortunately, death penalty

111
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,840
Checkmate

112
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
bravo

113
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,890
We don't suspect you Light

114
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:25,969
Ryuzaki too. He examined you just to know the probability

115
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:28,054
You need to suspect, when you're investigating

116
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:32,906
But the more important thing is to stop Kira from killing people as soon as possible

117
00:12:33,396 --> 00:12:35,118
I also hope...

118
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:39,470
that you're not Kira

119
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:43,242
If you get the Reaper's eye, you can see his real name

120
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,880
by giving me half of your lifetime

121
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,912
You can kill him when you want!

122
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,890
The Diet has stopped the regular council by the speech from the PM

123
00:12:56,479 --> 00:12:59,273
that crime rate is decreasing because of Kira

124
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,152
but many of the citizens and the young members of the Diet

125
00:13:02,187 --> 00:13:05,840
rather seem to support his opinion

126
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,880
Killing is bad, but

127
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,880
a nation often kills criminals under the law

128
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,350
The matter is whether it is a "right killing" or not

129
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:23,686
from this point of view, Kira's killing seems to be justified

130
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:28,752
Who? Who made this idiot in charge of the government?

131
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,900
We must not allow this situation to happen, sir

132
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,900
Yagami, what are you thinking?

133
00:13:34,435 --> 00:13:36,901
Where and what is your team doing?

134
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,320
Everything we do is based on L's directions

135
00:13:43,682 --> 00:13:45,682
What kind of person is L?

136
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,850
Is he American?

137
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,928
I can't tell you, sir

138
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:51,380
You!

139
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,754
L is risking his own life

140
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:56,735
We believe his will and follow him

141
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,900
I understand

142
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,633
You can have request money or staff as much as you need, so...

143
00:14:03,017 --> 00:14:04,687
catch Kira right away!

144
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,562
Nothing exciting at the Sakura TV festival

145
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,890
Isn't there any entertainment?

146
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,890
TV stars for example?

147
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,890
That'll cause a riot!

148
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,626
No, I don't think it's gonna happen

149
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,900
I beg you Mr. Demegawa! We might lose Saeko's life

150
00:14:34,572 --> 00:14:37,212
You must leave it to me as I've been doing research on Kira

151
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:39,405
I understand him the most

152
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,880
You are kind of..

153
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,880
unattractive

154
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,880
Morning!

155
00:14:47,642 --> 00:14:49,612
Not attractive?

156
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:54,890
-Saeko, this is our chance!
-I'm so excited

157
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,890
Are you sure it's ok to broadcast it without boss's permission?

158
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,900
Protect me even it gets you fired!

159
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,900
If we can get the ratings, they'll put hundreds of testimonials on the wall!

160
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,910
It's going to be the true Sakura TV festival

161
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,423
News isn't a comedy show!

162
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,910
Who do you think you are?

163
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,850
Your head and here should both be a little softer

164
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,890
Save the sexual harassment..

165
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,850
This is a case of kill or cure

166
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,900
What?

167
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Director

168
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,910
We've got information that Sakurat TV

169
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:38,493
will broadcast a message from Kira

170
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,920
3 days ago

171
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,890
We received two videotapes from somone who called himself the Second Kira

172
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,890
The Second Kira?

173
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,890
In the first videotape

174
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,850
there was a notice that the murderer who was arrested recently would die

175
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
and yesterday, he did die of heart attack

176
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,910
Ms. Sagami, confirm it please

177
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,910
Yes

178
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,910
Also, the Second Kira

179
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,870
requested us to broadcast the other video from 2:59 pm today

180
00:16:16,927 --> 00:16:19,397
We have not watched this video

181
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,890
As I said in the beginning

182
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:26,325
the Second Kira demanded us to broadcast the video

183
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,077
or he would kill all of our staff from the top

184
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,897
Please understand that we are hostages of Kira

185
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,860
As journalists, we risk our lives to broadcast this

186
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,004
Everyone should stay calm

187
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:54,944
Is this.. really happening here?

188
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,717
I don't want to goto Sakura TV festival anymore

189
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,900
It's now 2:59. Please watch this video

190
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,870
Here it is

191
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,910
I am the Second Kira

192
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,910
Just like Kira, I also hate evil

193
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,870
and I want to create an ideal world where there's no crime

194
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,640
Anyone who opposes Kira is my enemy

195
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Anyone who disturbes Kira is letting brutal criminals go free

196
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:28,766
so they must die so the society can become peaceful

197
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:36,206
Hibima Kazuhiko, one of the opposers who's now appearing on Taiyo TV

198
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,298
Will die of heart attack

199
00:17:40,034 --> 00:17:42,611
Kira's judgement is autocratic.

200
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,910
He is just a cruel murderer.

201
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:43,758
But..

202
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:48,870
What's wrong with Taiyo TV?

203
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,645
-Hurry!

204
00:17:52,530 --> 00:18:00,161
He certainly is an autocrat
We might be slaves of Kira

205
00:18:07,691 --> 00:18:09,717
Mr. Hibima?

206
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:11,880
Somebody.. Help

207
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:14,880
Someone please help

208
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,920
You alright¡­

209
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,920
Can you hear me

210
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,890
Still breathing?

211
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:29,930
Mr. Hibima unfairly insisted that Kira was evil and criticized him

212
00:18:32,338 --> 00:18:33,694
He deserves death

213
00:18:33,694 --> 00:18:35,572
Stop it!

214
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,860
You must accept Kira so we can create a future together

215
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,910
What are you doing?

216
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,910
Make them stop showing it now!

217
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,920
The producer of the program doesn't answer the phone

218
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:50,920
They just want the audience rating

219
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,890
Mr. Mogi arrived at the scene?

220
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,890
The furture is with Kira

221
00:18:58,097 --> 00:19:03,252
If you agree with Kira's justice, gather in from of Sakura TV

222
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:07,440
Let's raise our voices for Kira

223
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,910
Only Kira can purify this unclean world

224
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:13,910
He's right!

225
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,880
Kira is doing the right thing!

226
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Crime is decreasing thanks to Kira

227
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,920
That critic sure deserves it!

228
00:19:22,587 --> 00:19:25,415
Today's the Kira festival!

229
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,612
I'm scared! Let's go!

230
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:30,360
Come one, let's see what'll happen.
I'm actually a Kira supporter

231
00:19:30,395 --> 00:19:31,557
What?

232
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,900
Kira¡­

233
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,910
I won't let anyone interfer with what Kira's doing

234
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,910
Anyone does will die

235
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
Police!

236
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,999
Mr. Mogi

237
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:49,179
Stop!

238
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,920
Don't support Kira's justice

239
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,930
Do you defend the cruel mass murderer?

240
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,603
Don't forgive him!
Get away from here now!

241
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,930
What are you talking about? The police is totally useless

242
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,900
ya¡­

243
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,177
Kira is now protecting the world

244
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,684
No, Kira is a cruel murderer!

245
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,950
Wake up and disperse!

246
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:13,950
Kira taught us...

247
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,920
Disperse¡­

248
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,574
You are in danger too!

249
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,880
.... that the laws never help us

250
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:29,930
Do you hear the cries of the people?

251
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:35,286
People who lose their love can never be healed

252
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,351
Stop it

253
00:20:38,351 --> 00:20:39,701
Mr. Mogi!

254
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,910
Mr. Mogi¡­

255
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,920
Mr. Mogi¡­

256
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,890
Mr. Mogi¡­

257
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,235
Do you hear the murderer's laugh?

258
00:20:52,535 --> 00:20:56,457
Who took lives of innocent people, and live without being punished

259
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,930
You're in danger!
Get away from here!

260
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,940
Step aside!

261
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,910
Let me through

262
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,910
Disperse¡­

263
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,950
Get back

264
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,792
What are you doing?

265
00:21:14,663 --> 00:21:15,806
You must stay away from here

266
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,906
Kira has begun to act

267
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,940
for a bright, ideal world

268
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,610
Camera no. 1, zoom in on the fallen policemen

269
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,910
Great! He's dead!

270
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,571
You'll be dead if you go there

271
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
We can't just sit here and watch TV!

272
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,463
This Kira might be able to kill just by seeing the faces

273
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,142
The the policemen near the scene to keep away

274
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:03,900
Yes

275
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,910
Ryuzaki...!

276
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:12,900
We must fight with Kira

277
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,950
But

278
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:17,950
We must rescue Sayu!

279
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,960
This Kira's targets

280
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,960
are people who interrupt the broadcasting

281
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,960
Sayu should be safe

282
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,960
And Kira, if you're watching TV,

283
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,970
Come here now

284
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:32,616
I promise I will help you

285
00:22:33,827 --> 00:22:37,385
As you see, I have the eye

286
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,900
Let me see your Reaper, then I'll show you mine

287
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,920
Reaper£¿

288
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:49,371
Do you expect me to believe that such things really exist?

289
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,681
It must mean the ability of killing

290
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,721
And let's create a new world together!

291
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,940
What do you mean by the new world!

292
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,940
You murderer!

293
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,940
How can you kill people so easily?

294
00:23:08,572 --> 00:23:10,821
What did they do to you£¿

295
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,910
Murderer!

296
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,950
Murderer!

297
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,949
Sayu...! Don't upset him!

298
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,930
Murderer

299
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,930
Murderer¡­

300
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,930
Murderer

301
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,920
Murderer!

302
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,297
What are you doing!

303
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,920
A car just crashed into the station

304
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:48,950
We don't know yet what exactly happened

305
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,920
Is that..

306
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,966
really?

307
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:57,425
Sayu!

308
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,116
Dad?

309
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,592
Cover your face with this

310
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,940
go inside

311
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,920
Mogi..

312
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:38,169
We'll inform you as soon as we find out what is happening at the entrance

313
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:44,980
Alright, cut to commercials

314
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,990
The ratings will be 30... no, 40 at least

315
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,920
L's message earned 35%

316
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
You can't go in

317
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,930
Step aside

318
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,970
Is that you?

319
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:00,970
You're the producer£¿

320
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,238
You can't enter without...

321
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,887
The police£¿Stop broadcasting now!

322
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,190
If we do that, we're gonna die

323
00:26:08,885 --> 00:26:10,308
You want to see innocent people...

324
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:11,974
forced to get involved and killed?

325
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,898
I got it!

326
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:15,479
Calm down¡­

327
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:19,262
Got it..

328
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:21,994
Hello?

329
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:23,362
Thank you

330
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:30,055
Ryuzaki, I told them to stop broadcasting

331
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,449
I go the videotapes too

332
00:26:32,756 --> 00:26:33,618
This is as I thought

333
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:34,678
It was Mr. yagami!

334
00:26:35,451 --> 00:26:37,546
I can't do this in such as way

335
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:39,438
Dad, where is Sayu? Is she alright?

336
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,115
Light..

337
00:26:42,542 --> 00:26:44,627
Yes, we're both fine

338
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,158
Mr. Yagami, are you still wearing a helmet?

339
00:26:48,986 --> 00:26:50,776
No, I took it off

340
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,402
I'll go pick them up

341
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,424
Please arrange for the permission to enter the studio

342
00:26:54,425 --> 00:26:55,594
You'll be Kira's target!

343
00:26:55,792 --> 00:26:57,801
Dad and Sayu will not be harmed inside the studio

344
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:08,855
The Second Kira surely has the Reaper's eye

345
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,773
You've got a nice buddy huh?

346
00:27:11,808 --> 00:27:12,980
No

347
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:15,490
There's no proof that he's not my enemy

348
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:17,931
Then isn't it dangerous to go?

349
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:21,656
If he truely supports me, he'll be a strong weapon to wipe out L

350
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:23,901
I must find him before L does

351
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,970
Move out

352
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:39,930
Sakura TV has stopped broadcasting, following the order from the police

353
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,980
Taiyo TV

354
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,980
is protesting against Sakura TV

355
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,990
According to Taiyo TV

356
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:50,950
Mr. Hibima died because of Sakura TV

357
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,584
Misa, the recording is cancelled

358
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
yeah, alright

359
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,560
It can't be helped

360
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:03,722
I need to change clothes

361
00:28:13,577 --> 00:28:16,278
The Kira didn't show up

362
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,940
-Sayu
-Light

363
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,628
I was worried about you

364
00:28:41,628 --> 00:28:42,489
Mr. Mogi..

365
00:28:42,912 --> 00:28:43,950
He was killed¡­

366
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes, I will report it

367
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,960
Excuse me

368
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,950
Kira...?

369
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,622
I found you

370
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,633
I knew he'd come to me

371
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,795
Yagami...

372
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,095
Tsuki?

373
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:39,010
The videotapes were dispatched

374
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:42,363
at a post office in Kita-ku Osaka

375
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:43,980
The fingerprints are so small

376
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,990
so 'he' might be 'she'

377
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:50,990
Are you sure that these are from the Second Kira?

378
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,990
It may be a fake

379
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,000
You mean, this might be a fake by Kira that there are more Kiras?

380
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,085
Light, what do you think?

381
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:02,692
That's impossible

382
00:30:03,065 --> 00:30:05,354
And this Kira can kill only by seeing the faces

383
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,010
The video images were childish,

384
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,010
trying to use the media slyly

385
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:13,010
This Kira is way stupid and different from the first Kira

386
00:30:13,409 --> 00:30:17,127
Besides, the first Kira doesn't kill innocent people

387
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:18,974
You're right

388
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:22,212
If I were Kira, I'd get angry

389
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:26,000
This Kira tried to make us believe that he was outside the studio

390
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Had the studio on surveillance

391
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
He could be hidden inside the studio

392
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,023
Check everyone in the studio

393
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:37,936
If the first Kira joins the second Kira

394
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,344
It will be a huge threat

395
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:43,513
We must prevent it. Mr Yagami..

396
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:46,446
Is it possible to send Kira a message through TV?

397
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,414
What kind of message?

398
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:57,014
Nishiyama Saeko is the No. 1 anchorwoman in Japan

399
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,799
Thank you so much

400
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:02,446
That's clever... You're the man, Demegawa

401
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,201
How can they be so blind?

402
00:31:07,571 --> 00:31:10,652
The Second Kira trusted and sent the tapes to us

403
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,486
because you've been reporting on the First Kira's activities

404
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:18,586
They should appreciate you

405
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,693
Irritating¡­

406
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,717
Why didn't you become an anchor?

407
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,138
See how Saeko behaves?

408
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:30,099
To be an anchor, you have to sell youself as a 'female'

409
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,900
I can't stand it

410
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,440
You're prettier than her

411
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:37,282
Give me a break

412
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:39,578
Demegawa!

413
00:31:40,145 --> 00:31:41,685
Did you survive the torture by the police?

414
00:31:42,342 --> 00:31:44,483
Yeah, and more than that

415
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,821
I got a sweet gift from them

416
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,680
What's that?

417
00:31:47,683 --> 00:31:50,051
That's a message from the police to the Second Kira

418
00:31:50,637 --> 00:31:51,795
We can expect high ratings

419
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,990
Great job!

420
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,455
This is a message for the Second Kira

421
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Stop trying to approach the First Kira

422
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,970
It's not too late if you haven't met him

423
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:07,010
You must never get involved in Kira just because you're curious

424
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,010
You'll be used

425
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,010
and definitely killed by Kira

426
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,980
Yagami Light....

427
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,436
It's written "Moon"
but read "Light"

428
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:24,030
"...please provide us with any information regarding Kira"

429
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:26,030
"... save those living under Kira's terrorist acts"

430
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,062
"... and save the world"

431
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,976
Reating the message...

432
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:37,010
Here is the data for every staff at Sakura TV

433
00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:39,767
and the list of people who entered the studio that day

434
00:32:39,993 --> 00:32:41,311
What a huge amount

435
00:32:42,746 --> 00:32:43,882
That total...

436
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:46,484
8000 people. approximately.

437
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:47,670
Let's start

438
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,980
Oh, good evening!

439
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,947
Nice to meet you, I'm Amane Misa

440
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,435
You're a friend of Sayu?

441
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,087
Oh, no

442
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,966
I was watching TV and... I thought you must be worried.

443
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:22,951
I couldn't help come to see you

444
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:27,010
to show you this notebook

445
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,494
Here, touch it

446
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,317
Light, you're back!

447
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
She's my friend.

448
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,073
She'll come to my room for a while

449
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,076
Hello

450
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,599
Light, did you invite a friend?

451
00:33:57,862 --> 00:33:59,186
Nice to meet you

452
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,202
Her face looks familiar...

453
00:34:11,237 --> 00:34:14,506
She's Misa-misa! of the Happy Sweets!

454
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,405
Yeah! Amane Misa!

455
00:34:30,621 --> 00:34:31,782
How did you know it?

456
00:34:32,771 --> 00:34:33,907
Ah, that's what I thought!

457
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,352
You haven't done 'the deal'

458
00:34:36,931 --> 00:34:40,131
You know, you can see people's names and their lifespan

459
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,729
but you can't see the lifespan of a person who has the notebook

460
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:48,682
I couldn't answer unless you ask me

461
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,173
Are you... working in the studio or something?

462
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:59,990
um... I... I think I'm kind of famous..

463
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:05,727
A singer?

464
00:35:05,727 --> 00:35:07,737
Oh, actually, this is my first CD.

465
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,050
I also appear on magazine and TV.

466
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,747
Oh, there's a new movie too

467
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,716
How did you find out where I live?

468
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:19,020
From the internet,

469
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:21,020
You gave a speech at the entrance ceremony of college

470
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:23,030
I found a photo of you there

471
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,030
If you were arrested,

472
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,419
Kira's secrets would come out!

473
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:30,030
I'm sorry!

474
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,040
But I haven't been arrested

475
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,767
and I won't be if I follow your orders from now on

476
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,420
Right?

477
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,886
I can find out L's name

478
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:47,050
I'll be your eyes. So...

479
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,990
So what?

480
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:55,043
Let me be your girlfriend

481
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,224
I can't

482
00:35:59,511 --> 00:36:00,672
Why not?

483
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,244
There are your fingerprints on the tapes

484
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:06,474
If the police take fingerprints directly from you,

485
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,466
they'll find out you're the Second Kira.

486
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,955
Those weren't mine!

487
00:36:11,801 --> 00:36:13,776
I'm not that stupid

488
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,050
I have a friend in Osaka who's into the occult

489
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:19,060
and I showed her fake pictures of ghosts

490
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:22,060
and asked her to send videos to TV stations together...

491
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:24,677
And what is she doing now?

492
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,976
If you want, I'll kill her right now

493
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:32,876
No, The police'll easily link her to you

494
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,567
If you don't believe me...

495
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,538
You can keep my Death Note

496
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:45,050
I'm still the owner of the notebook even if you keep it.

497
00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:48,050
So I can still work my eyes for you.

498
00:36:48,538 --> 00:36:49,934
Right Remu?

499
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:52,056
Yes, you're right

500
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,542
Now, I can't kill you

501
00:36:58,908 --> 00:37:01,328
and you can kill me if you don't need me

502
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,029
I'm happy...

503
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,632
...even if you're just going to use me

504
00:37:15,874 --> 00:37:17,290
Trust me

505
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,805
Why are you doing this?

506
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,097
Misa lost all of her family members 3 years ago

507
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:31,180
They were killed by a burglar

508
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,450
Since Misa had seen his face

509
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,355
The suspect was soon arrested

510
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,460
But Misa was the only witness so it wasn't enough to convict him

511
00:37:54,534 --> 00:37:58,182
Tamura Yoichi, the suspect was soon released

512
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,400
She was caught in a deep empty darkness in her mind

513
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:12,488
Everyone gave up on Misa's future

514
00:38:13,038 --> 00:38:14,965
But one day,

515
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:18,159
Something happened

516
00:38:23,224 --> 00:38:25,406
"Tamura Yoichi Found Dead"

517
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,718
"Is This Kira?"

518
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:34,509
Kira punished him

519
00:38:35,542 --> 00:38:39,093
Misa was grateful to the God named Kira

520
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:49,807
Please

521
00:38:52,942 --> 00:38:55,114
Trust me

522
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,464
You are everything to me

523
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:03,267
But you killed innocent policemen

524
00:39:04,292 --> 00:39:07,805
Don't you think it's the same as the burglar who killed your family?

525
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:10,805
Don't say such things to me?

526
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:15,450
You also think that..

527
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:18,902
...sacrifices for the good of all can't be helped

528
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,420
It was the only thing I could do

529
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:30,069
I really wanted to see you

530
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,345
I understand

531
00:39:43,054 --> 00:39:44,745
For me...

532
00:39:45,479 --> 00:39:47,510
You shortened your own life...

533
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:50,908
Your eyes became my weapon

534
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:52,915
Thank you...

535
00:39:58,191 --> 00:39:59,853
I'll do my best

536
00:40:01,905 --> 00:40:03,875
to be loved by you..

537
00:40:17,625 --> 00:40:19,406
I'll arrange a chance for you to see L.

538
00:40:19,595 --> 00:40:22,595
And you'll see L's real name

539
00:40:22,595 --> 00:40:24,508
Can you do it?

540
00:40:25,497 --> 00:40:28,374
You don't have to ask me, just say "do it"

541
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:32,090
I'll do anything you want me to

542
00:40:32,457 --> 00:40:34,937
If one of us gets arrested

543
00:40:34,605 --> 00:40:37,615
we'll never talk about the other one and the Death Note

544
00:40:37,615 --> 00:40:39,822
Can you swear?

545
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:42,354
Yes, I swear

546
00:40:42,615 --> 00:40:44,054
Good

547
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,771
Then... It's my turn

548
00:40:51,625 --> 00:40:55,039
We're gonna date at least once a week

549
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:58,588
You don't understand what I said

550
00:40:58,605 --> 00:41:00,605
But once L dies,

551
00:41:00,605 --> 00:41:02,371
There won't be no difficulty between us, right?

552
00:41:02,605 --> 00:41:05,015
You underestimate L

553
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:07,024
Besides L is already...

554
00:41:07,615 --> 00:41:09,996
Suspecting that I am Kira

555
00:41:09,997 --> 00:41:10,997
What?

556
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,304
L is so smart

557
00:41:15,326 --> 00:41:19,170
Everybody says L hasn't figured out anything yet...

558
00:41:19,205 --> 00:41:22,564
Now I've reached a position where I can contact him directly,

559
00:41:22,625 --> 00:41:25,205
L and Kira are getting closer...?

560
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:29,891
I'm impressed by both!

561
00:41:29,892 --> 00:41:31,287
It's so exciting

562
00:41:31,605 --> 00:41:33,763
And of course, I need you to kill L.

563
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:36,233
So I wanted to contact you as quickly as possible

564
00:41:36,233 --> 00:41:39,001
If so, why just can't we date?

565
00:41:39,036 --> 00:41:40,615
If you want to date once a week

566
00:41:40,615 --> 00:41:44,615
I'll have to date other girls

567
00:41:44,615 --> 00:41:46,625
to avoid being suspected that we have a special relationship

568
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,585
You can't do that

569
00:41:49,625 --> 00:41:51,625
If I see you dating other girl..

570
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,124
I'll kill her!

571
00:41:54,635 --> 00:41:57,058
I'm the only one who'll date you!

572
00:41:57,635 --> 00:42:00,149
If you don't obey me, I have to kill you

573
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,605
I won't let you kill her, Yagami Light!

574
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:08,615
If you harm this girl,

575
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:10,437
I won't forgive you

576
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:13,253
I see her lifespan

577
00:42:14,123 --> 00:42:17,550
If she dies, I'll think it's because you killed her. I'll have to kill you

578
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:20,570
If I find you trying to kill her..

579
00:42:20,625 --> 00:42:23,650
I'll kill you before that happens

580
00:42:41,615 --> 00:42:42,973
Ryuzaki...?

581
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:48,234
Since that, there's no new action by the Second Kira

582
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:53,471
I'm afriad the FIrst and the Second Kira have made contact already

583
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,799
Isn't it careless to expose your face?

584
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,722
Yes, it's dangerous if you're Kira

585
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:04,296
You're the only one outside who knows that I'm L, so

586
00:43:05,388 --> 00:43:09,041
If you told the Second Kira about me, it's "the end." To avoid it,

587
00:43:09,615 --> 00:43:11,585
I brought this

588
00:43:14,256 --> 00:43:15,422
That'll work

589
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,105
Did you come to watch over me?

590
00:43:19,625 --> 00:43:22,226
You think Kira is a college student. don't you?

591
00:43:22,625 --> 00:43:25,635
I have an important job here

592
00:43:25,635 --> 00:43:26,927
About Kira?

593
00:43:29,082 --> 00:43:31,052
Light

594
00:43:33,645 --> 00:43:35,868
I had a recording nearby so I came to see you

595
00:43:35,868 --> 00:43:36,715
Here I am

596
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:39,514
You

597
00:43:45,798 --> 00:43:46,840
Oh?

598
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,778
Are you Light's friend?

599
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:51,167
Yeah

600
00:43:53,635 --> 00:43:55,579
His name is Ryuzaki

601
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,380
Why're you wearing such as stupid mask?

602
00:44:00,635 --> 00:44:03,028
Why don't you take it off?

603
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:06,588
Hi there!

604
00:44:08,645 --> 00:44:10,393
Are you... Ryuzaki...?

605
00:44:18,694 --> 00:44:21,114
Nice to meet you.
I'm Amane Misa

606
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:25,920
Um... Light?
Your friend is a little weird

607
00:44:26,635 --> 00:44:28,115
He's just shy

608
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:34,368
I envy you Light

609
00:44:38,645 --> 00:44:40,331
I listen to your Heaven's Door!

610
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:43,397
Really?
I'm so glad!

611
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:48,212
Light, why can you date with such a cute pop star?

612
00:44:48,625 --> 00:44:50,733
I approached him first

613
00:44:50,768 --> 00:44:52,198
Misa!

614
00:44:52,199 --> 00:44:53,971
Look, isn't that Misa-Misa?

615
00:44:55,635 --> 00:44:57,102
She really is!

616
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:00,605
Why! Why is she here?

617
00:45:02,645 --> 00:45:04,645
This is great

618
00:45:04,645 --> 00:45:06,615
It's real

619
00:45:11,318 --> 00:45:15,349
You're the most intelligent students in Japan, right?

620
00:45:15,384 --> 00:45:16,803
Please shake hands with me

621
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:21,740
Oh! Someone touched my bottom!

622
00:45:22,635 --> 00:45:24,093
Can't forgive him!

623
00:45:25,083 --> 00:45:27,951
I, the greatest detective, will definitely catch the pervert!

624
00:45:28,635 --> 00:45:29,436
Here you go

625
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:32,823
Ryuzaki, you're funny

626
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:35,833
Then, don't you want to date with me?

627
00:45:36,645 --> 00:45:39,337
Too bad, here's my only sweet heart

628
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,282
Whaaat?

629
00:45:41,797 --> 00:45:44,047
I have a class, so go back to your work

630
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:45,293
Right

631
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:48,227
Sorry, but I'm glad to see you

632
00:45:48,655 --> 00:45:50,063
See you soon, Light

633
00:45:58,635 --> 00:46:00,635
It's good...

634
00:46:00,635 --> 00:46:02,605
She's so cute

635
00:46:06,645 --> 00:46:07,934
Ryuzaki

636
00:46:08,645 --> 00:46:10,296
She's my girlfriend

637
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:12,249
bye

638
00:46:13,094 --> 00:46:14,609
It was lucky to see Misa-Misa.

639
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,625
I'll go back to the office

640
00:46:17,655 --> 00:46:18,488
Take care

641
00:46:25,635 --> 00:46:26,594
I won...!

642
00:46:30,776 --> 00:46:33,148
"Misa"

643
00:46:47,655 --> 00:46:48,741
Hello

644
00:46:53,665 --> 00:46:56,075
What are you doing?

645
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:03,595
Someone dropped this cell phone and I picked it up

646
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:06,226
It belongs to Misa

647
00:47:07,344 --> 00:47:08,666
Give it to me

648
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:23,550
Calling her just after you said goodbye?

649
00:47:24,084 --> 00:47:26,149
You really are in love with her
Or,

650
00:47:26,731 --> 00:47:29,729
Was there anything you had to ask her immediately

651
00:47:38,350 --> 00:47:39,498
Hello

652
00:47:39,751 --> 00:47:41,367
We have the target.

653
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:44,407
It wasn't the place we expected

654
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,071
since she moved around so much

655
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:49,094
We'll send her to the office

656
00:47:49,297 --> 00:47:52,289
I got it
Thank you for the hard work

657
00:47:54,665 --> 00:47:55,776
Just now

658
00:47:55,777 --> 00:47:59,786
We arrested Amane Misa for the suspicion to be the Second Kira

659
00:48:00,675 --> 00:48:01,638
What?

660
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:09,095
She is an enthusiastic supporter of Kira and she was in the studio that day

661
00:48:10,063 --> 00:48:11,588
From her room,

662
00:48:10,655 --> 00:48:13,655
We found material evidences such as a cosmetic powder

663
00:48:13,655 --> 00:48:16,655
and fibers matching her clothes

664
00:48:17,181 --> 00:48:20,538
We're not going to announce so please cooperate for awhile

665
00:48:21,768 --> 00:48:24,810
You have to stay away from the office

666
00:48:25,665 --> 00:48:27,048
What are you going to do to her?

667
00:48:27,452 --> 00:48:31,448
I can't tell you.
Can I take her phone too?

668
00:48:34,187 --> 00:48:35,951
I can't believe she's the Kira

669
00:48:37,685 --> 00:48:37,879
It can't be

670
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:44,601
Awwww, Light

671
00:48:44,890 --> 00:48:48,528
The goddess of the luck is gone

672
00:48:50,098 --> 00:48:51,227
See you

673
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:39,365
Ryuzaki

674
00:49:40,785 --> 00:49:43,432
Do we really have to do this?

675
00:49:44,198 --> 00:49:46,631
Second Kira can kill by seeing the face

676
00:49:46,631 --> 00:49:50,580
It's reasonable to restrain her with a 24 hour surveillance

677
00:49:51,776 --> 00:49:54,776
If she isn't Kira...

678
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:56,318
This will violate human rights

679
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:58,202
We've got the evidence!

680
00:49:58,675 --> 00:50:01,675
Besides she stays silent even in this situation

681
00:50:01,675 --> 00:50:04,675
If she's innocent, why doesn't she just say so

682
00:50:06,244 --> 00:50:08,244
Tell her agent to announce

683
00:50:06,685 --> 00:50:10,167
that she's in hospital

684
00:50:10,857 --> 00:50:12,279
It's already done

685
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:14,824
Mr. Yagami

686
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:19,064
Amane and Light have a close relationship

687
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:21,425
What?

688
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:26,065
She's even visited your home, Mr. Yagami

689
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,326
Light...

690
00:50:32,733 --> 00:50:34,733
I have to contact Rem

691
00:50:37,229 --> 00:50:37,229
before Misa talks them about the secrets...

692
00:50:37,733 --> 00:50:39,686
It's gonna get worse

693
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:44,133
We can't part from the owner of the Death Note

694
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:50,006
Unless the owner abandons the right of possession or...

695
00:50:50,655 --> 00:50:52,301
dies

696
00:51:08,743 --> 00:51:12,389
She hasn't eaten anything in 2 days

697
00:51:13,568 --> 00:51:16,094
She has a lot of guts..
She doesn't even complain

698
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:19,741
I'm... becoming a fan of her

699
00:51:21,753 --> 00:51:22,389
I'm going to buy her CD

700
00:51:22,904 --> 00:51:23,724
Idiot!

701
00:51:25,382 --> 00:51:26,878
Toilet...

702
00:51:28,146 --> 00:51:30,003
I want to use the toilet

703
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:37,922
Even after she got caught,

704
00:51:37,923 --> 00:51:40,304
Kira hasn't stopped punishing

705
00:51:45,416 --> 00:51:46,158
Here

706
00:51:49,426 --> 00:51:50,750
Misa

707
00:51:53,926 --> 00:51:55,936
Please...

708
00:51:55,936 --> 00:51:57,896
Say something...

709
00:51:59,906 --> 00:52:01,566
We don't want to..

710
00:52:01,567 --> 00:52:04,253
make you suffer anymore

711
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:09,099
What do you...

712
00:52:09,913 --> 00:52:11,762
know about Kira?

713
00:52:14,916 --> 00:52:16,506
I can't stand this anymore

714
00:52:16,926 --> 00:52:18,447
kill me

715
00:52:19,926 --> 00:52:21,754
kill me

716
00:52:23,926 --> 00:52:25,867
We must release her!

717
00:52:26,936 --> 00:52:29,161
Amane Misa, do you hear me?

718
00:52:29,936 --> 00:52:31,906
Please

719
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:34,876
kill me

720
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:42,289
Do you mean that you admit you're the Second Kira?

721
00:52:42,799 --> 00:52:45,001
It doesn't matter if I'm Kira or not

722
00:52:46,926 --> 00:52:49,388
If I have to live like this...

723
00:52:52,425 --> 00:52:53,975
I'd rather die

724
00:52:58,305 --> 00:52:58,871
Hey!

725
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:03,039
kill me now

726
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:08,629
You're able to kill me easily!

727
00:53:11,977 --> 00:53:15,834
I should have died that time anyway

728
00:53:18,926 --> 00:53:21,219
I'm happy even if I die now

729
00:53:24,521 --> 00:53:27,308
kill me before I get old and lose my beauty

730
00:53:29,936 --> 00:53:31,906
kill me right now

731
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:48,926
Rem..

732
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:52,494
Misa abandoned the possessive right of the Death Note

733
00:53:54,436 --> 00:53:57,484
She asked me to kill her

734
00:53:58,154 --> 00:54:00,222
because she didn't want you to get in trouble

735
00:54:00,257 --> 00:54:02,927
Do you understand, Yagami Light?

736
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,488
Everything she did was to be loved by you

737
00:54:07,916 --> 00:54:08,854
Did she...

738
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:13,640
lose all the memory about the Death Note?

739
00:54:13,831 --> 00:54:14,907
Of course

740
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:17,249
She forgot that she has killed people

741
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:20,291
or that you are Kira

742
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:24,000
I told her that she'd never see me anymore

743
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:29,168
and all she'd remember is that she loves Yagami Light

744
00:54:29,986 --> 00:54:33,063
Misa answered it would be fine

745
00:54:37,946 --> 00:54:40,608
Save her at all cost!

746
00:54:40,946 --> 00:54:43,869
If you don't, I'll kill you

747
00:54:44,956 --> 00:54:47,540
With a Death God being so nice to her..

748
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,161
Misa must be very happy

749
00:54:50,196 --> 00:54:54,369
I am just trying to keep the promise with Jealous

750
00:54:56,936 --> 00:54:58,405
Jealous£¿

751
00:54:58,936 --> 00:55:02,733
Jealous was always looking down on Misa

752
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:07,877
He had a father-like sympathy towards the girl who lost her parents

753
00:55:08,644 --> 00:55:12,626
However, when the time comes when Misa would die

754
00:55:14,064 --> 00:55:18,387
Eventually, he broke the rules of the Death Gods

755
00:55:18,926 --> 00:55:21,926
He wrote the name of the man

756
00:55:21,926 --> 00:55:25,540
and extended Misa's lifespan

757
00:55:25,936 --> 00:55:31,390
The Death Gods exist only to take lives of humans

758
00:55:31,936 --> 00:55:33,946
It's a serious taboo to save a human

759
00:55:33,946 --> 00:55:37,124
and extend her lifespan

760
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:40,550
Jealous fell to pieces and died

761
00:55:41,697 --> 00:55:44,808
asking me to take care of her

762
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,370
Therefore

763
00:55:46,959 --> 00:55:49,328
Jealous's Death Note was given to Misa

764
00:55:50,966 --> 00:55:54,896
A Death God who falls in love with a human shall die...

765
00:55:58,936 --> 00:56:00,936
a great story, indeed

766
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,969
If you won't save Misa,

767
00:56:02,946 --> 00:56:04,906
I will kill you

768
00:56:05,946 --> 00:56:08,934
Don't give me the same phrase over and over again, Rem

769
00:56:09,707 --> 00:56:11,967
Imagine how she feels if I die

770
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,317
She'll definitely kill herself

771
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,025
Can't you even imagine that?

772
00:56:23,794 --> 00:56:25,166
There's a way

773
00:56:28,549 --> 00:56:30,393
It needs a lot of work though..

774
00:56:35,946 --> 00:56:38,016
Are you really sure that it will save Misa

775
00:56:38,051 --> 00:56:40,764
if only I follow your direction

776
00:56:40,946 --> 00:56:42,887
Can't you trust me even a little?

777
00:56:42,887 --> 00:56:46,348
He's smarter than you think

778
00:56:46,956 --> 00:56:49,139
Ok, I trust you

779
00:56:49,956 --> 00:56:51,372
Yagami Light

780
00:56:51,984 --> 00:56:53,631
I leave Misa to you

781
00:57:01,936 --> 00:57:04,714
What are you doing with my Death Note?

782
00:57:05,112 --> 00:57:06,639
I'm just hiding it

783
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:11,229
When I discard its possession, I'll say...

784
00:57:12,767 --> 00:57:14,093
"I discard it"

785
00:57:15,950 --> 00:57:18,628
"I discard it"...
hum....

786
00:57:20,966 --> 00:57:22,966
Hey stalker

787
00:57:22,966 --> 00:57:24,966
If you quit now,

788
00:57:24,966 --> 00:57:27,049
I won't accuse you!

789
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:31,790
I'll give you my autograph and a kiss!

790
00:57:33,636 --> 00:57:35,636
Oh please!

791
00:57:34,946 --> 00:57:36,946
Let me out of here!

792
00:57:38,102 --> 00:57:39,731
What happened to her during the blackout

793
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:40,731
She kept repeating..

794
00:57:43,276 --> 00:57:45,823
We are not stalkers.

795
00:57:45,823 --> 00:57:46,795
We are the police

796
00:57:47,618 --> 00:57:50,628
The police can't do such a thing!

797
00:57:50,628 --> 00:57:53,628
Pop stars are wiser than you think!

798
00:57:53,628 --> 00:57:55,628
If you think we are stalkers,

799
00:57:55,628 --> 00:57:57,628
why did you keep silent?

800
00:57:57,628 --> 00:57:59,557
I don't know!

801
00:57:59,638 --> 00:58:01,638
You suddenly caught me

802
00:58:01,638 --> 00:58:04,638
when I was just going to have lunch with Light

803
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:07,649
Do you admit the relationship between Yagmai Light?

804
00:58:07,684 --> 00:58:08,608
Of course...

805
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:10,683
Of course I do. He's my boyfriend.

806
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:14,332
Is she really the same person?

807
00:58:15,098 --> 00:58:17,250
Then how, did you and Light know each other?

808
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:20,772
I fell in love with him at first sight at Sakura TV station

809
00:58:21,283 --> 00:58:23,917
I found his address and went to his home

810
00:58:25,671 --> 00:58:26,802
Anything wrong?

811
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,359
You know how she acted before

812
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:34,741
Now she frankly admitted about Light

813
00:58:35,451 --> 00:58:36,456
I'm confused

814
00:58:44,977 --> 00:58:47,446
Who said that we can't bring cellphones into the office?

815
00:58:47,481 --> 00:58:48,277
ya..

816
00:58:49,012 --> 00:58:49,925
Hello

817
00:58:52,114 --> 00:58:53,903
I got it, please come in

818
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:59,126
Keep recording and shut down the screen

819
00:58:59,161 --> 00:58:59,598
Yes

820
00:59:04,594 --> 00:59:06,564
Is someone coming?

821
00:59:08,648 --> 00:59:10,716
Light!

822
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:15,465
I've told Ryuzaki but...

823
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,095
As L said, I might be the Kira

824
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,497
What on earth are you talking about?

825
00:59:22,628 --> 00:59:24,520
I've been thinking that..

826
00:59:25,573 --> 00:59:28,734
It may be better if people who committed serious crimes die

827
00:59:29,579 --> 00:59:30,869
So it's possible that I may become Kira

828
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:33,675
You're not the only one who thinks so!

829
00:59:33,789 --> 00:59:35,312
Are you trying to cover Misa?

830
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:40,954
I don't know much about her yet since we've just started dating

831
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,324
I can't believe that she's Kira

832
00:59:44,156 --> 00:59:46,076
Of course, I'm not conscious of Kira in me

833
00:59:46,077 --> 00:59:47,413
but,

834
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:50,265
I might have a multiple personality

835
00:59:51,409 --> 00:59:52,635
I want you to figure it out

836
00:59:52,636 --> 00:59:55,064
We investigated you, but couldn't find anything suspicious

837
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,965
But we watched over him only when he was home

838
00:59:58,486 --> 01:00:01,174
We don't know exactly what he did outside

839
01:00:01,772 --> 01:00:05,445
Then tie his arms and legs and keep him under surveillance

840
01:00:05,445 --> 01:00:06,357
This time

841
01:00:08,094 --> 01:00:10,371
It's an around-the-clock surveillance

842
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,355
That'll be fine with me

843
01:00:14,387 --> 01:00:15,943
But if,

844
01:00:16,434 --> 01:00:19,473
new crimes are committed while I'm under surveillance...

845
01:00:19,911 --> 01:00:21,811
and Kira punishes the criminals

846
01:00:22,657 --> 01:00:23,773
When it happens

847
01:00:24,436 --> 01:00:26,575
We'll certainly free you

848
01:00:29,534 --> 01:00:30,377
Thank you

849
01:00:38,854 --> 01:00:39,460
Light...

850
01:00:41,055 --> 01:00:42,171
Do you really mean it?

851
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:05,222
Where's Light?

852
01:01:06,995 --> 01:01:09,400
What happened to our son?

853
01:01:09,998 --> 01:01:11,980
Dad, why don't you say something?

854
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,280
Dear

855
01:02:03,986 --> 01:02:06,719
"Celebrating LIght's 18th birthday"

856
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:12,223
"This is a rulebook which was based on human wisdom"

857
01:02:12,258 --> 01:02:14,891
"which still struggles to answer what justice is"

858
01:02:15,296 --> 01:02:16,360
"Thanks, dad!"

859
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,982
"I want to study and think about what justice is"

860
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:29,030
Amane Misa: Surveillance Day 8

861
01:02:30,502 --> 01:02:31,505
Yagami Light: Surveillance Day 3

862
01:02:33,835 --> 01:02:35,290
How is it, Ryuzaki?

863
01:02:36,985 --> 01:02:39,533
Has kira killed anyone yet?

864
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:44,660
There's no activities so far

865
01:02:46,310 --> 01:02:48,386
No criminals have been killed

866
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:50,645
Is that so...

867
01:02:53,001 --> 01:02:56,389
Then I'm getting even more suspicious.

868
01:02:57,468 --> 01:02:59,583
I'm soooo bored!

869
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:01,571
I can't eat apples

870
01:03:02,010 --> 01:03:04,176
and I can't even talk with you.

871
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:07,742
I wonder how Rem's doing now

872
01:03:43,985 --> 01:03:47,757
Where's my ID card?

873
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:50,022
Does anyone know?

874
01:04:29,427 --> 01:04:31,040
Don't make a sound

875
01:04:31,758 --> 01:04:34,438
I brought a little gift for you

876
01:04:38,006 --> 01:04:40,008
Misa. Day 12
Light: Day 7

877
01:04:40,008 --> 01:04:41,976
I want to see Light

878
01:04:43,011 --> 01:04:45,013
I want to see Light, stalkers!

879
01:04:45,013 --> 01:04:46,947
Dad, mom

880
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:50,037
Light,

881
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,253
You look exhausted

882
01:04:54,481 --> 01:04:55,741
Are you okay?

883
01:04:57,993 --> 01:05:00,568
Yeah, I know I look so miserable right now

884
01:05:01,997 --> 01:05:04,721
But I don't care about such as useless pride..

885
01:05:06,957 --> 01:05:07,676
"I discard it"

886
01:05:09,004 --> 01:05:11,071
You "discard" it?

887
01:05:11,693 --> 01:05:13,797
You'll lose your memory

888
01:05:14,009 --> 01:05:15,977
Alright, Light.

889
01:05:17,012 --> 01:05:18,946
Goodbye

890
01:05:41,828 --> 01:05:42,650
Ryuzaki...

891
01:05:44,462 --> 01:05:45,307
What's wrong?

892
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:49,995
I know I asked you to do this to me

893
01:05:51,012 --> 01:05:52,954
But now I surely know..

894
01:05:54,893 --> 01:05:56,297
This is a waste of time

895
01:05:57,647 --> 01:05:59,218
I'm not Kira

896
01:05:59,977 --> 01:06:03,108
I'll be the judge of that, not you

897
01:06:04,171 --> 01:06:06,173
It's totally impossible to do such cruel things

898
01:06:06,173 --> 01:06:07,968
without being conscious

899
01:06:09,579 --> 01:06:10,506
Don't you think so?

900
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:14,289
It was you who said that you might be Kira

901
01:06:15,024 --> 01:06:16,843
without being conscious

902
01:06:17,184 --> 01:06:19,177
While I'm here, I clearly saw my goal

903
01:06:19,887 --> 01:06:22,677
I won't let Kira go free, he drove me into a corner

904
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:24,398
Ryuzaki!

905
01:06:24,399 --> 01:06:27,243
Let's cooperate and find a way to reach Kira!

906
01:06:27,871 --> 01:06:31,618
We can get him!

907
01:06:32,791 --> 01:06:35,962
Light...
suddenly became so positive

908
01:06:53,187 --> 01:06:55,744
Misa: Day 19
Light: Day 14

909
01:06:55,965 --> 01:06:58,661
Since he offered to do it, but

910
01:06:59,345 --> 01:07:00,997
I'm worried about Misa

911
01:07:05,351 --> 01:07:06,792
She's a tough kid

912
01:07:07,353 --> 01:07:09,224
If I were her, I'd go insane

913
01:07:17,198 --> 01:07:17,801
Ryuzaki!

914
01:07:19,537 --> 01:07:20,485
Kira is back!

915
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:23,831
Criminals are dying of heart attack one after another

916
01:07:26,544 --> 01:07:27,103
Light!

917
01:07:28,099 --> 01:07:30,847
There's been no action from Kira for 2 weeks.

918
01:07:32,101 --> 01:07:33,331
It's time you admit that you're Kira

919
01:07:33,331 --> 01:07:34,049
Hey!

920
01:07:36,168 --> 01:07:39,460
If you see only the current situation, I'm guilty. But this is a trap...

921
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:43,550
I said I'm not Kira!
Believe me!

922
01:08:07,778 --> 01:08:10,325
Why did Kira... choose me as his replacement?

923
01:08:11,522 --> 01:08:15,400
You often predicted who'll be the next target of Kira

924
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:19,630
You must have noticed the reason through your reports

925
01:08:27,838 --> 01:08:29,840
Kira's punishment...

926
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:32,843
...is nearly the same as my view on justice

927
01:08:33,349 --> 01:08:34,428
That's what I thought

928
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:44,274
Kira is just trying to make the world a better place

929
01:08:44,821 --> 01:08:48,221
It's my mission to tell the people that he's doing the right thing

930
01:08:49,131 --> 01:08:51,732
If I were Kira, I would use the media more efficiently!

931
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:57,853
That makes you the most suitable person as Kira's partner

932
01:08:58,681 --> 01:08:59,791
That is the reason

933
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,866
Kira chose me as his partner...

934
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:18,777
Misa: Day 23
Light: Day 18

935
01:09:20,837 --> 01:09:24,387
Criminals are constantly being killed

936
01:09:25,829 --> 01:09:27,831
Even the ones they never knew

937
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:31,653
It's impossible to kill them in this situation

938
01:09:34,838 --> 01:09:36,254
For example,

939
01:09:36,961 --> 01:09:38,837
if the Kira's ability has been transferred to another person

940
01:09:39,659 --> 01:09:41,602
and the person has become the Third Kira

941
01:09:42,167 --> 01:09:44,625
and they've lost their memories

942
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:46,483
It explains everything

943
01:09:47,327 --> 01:09:48,158
Even if you were right,

944
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,433
there's no way to prove it

945
01:09:56,537 --> 01:09:57,305
Ryuzaki

946
01:10:00,579 --> 01:10:03,144
Why don't we try a different approach?

947
01:10:20,048 --> 01:10:21,813
How do you feel?

948
01:10:25,053 --> 01:10:26,803
Good, thanks

949
01:10:27,055 --> 01:10:28,962
I'm impressed with your courage

950
01:10:31,059 --> 01:10:34,380
Still, we have the evidence found in Amane's room

951
01:10:34,987 --> 01:10:39,300
You can't go outside until we solve the case

952
01:10:40,068 --> 01:10:41,873
If I have to stay here anyway

953
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:45,824
Let me go back to the team and help you find Kira

954
01:10:46,074 --> 01:10:49,561
Yes, I was thinking about the exact same thing

955
01:10:50,614 --> 01:10:55,709
You have to stay with me all day and assist me

956
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:58,452
Thanks, Ryuzaki

957
01:10:59,754 --> 01:11:01,280
Let's find Kira together

958
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:11,132
I love you...

959
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,591
Light

960
01:11:28,095 --> 01:11:29,797
Ms Wakita!
Are you okay?

961
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:31,038
What happened to you?

962
01:11:31,723 --> 01:11:32,635
Get an ambulance!

963
01:11:39,060 --> 01:11:40,116
She's dead

964
01:11:41,433 --> 01:11:44,836
Her name is Wakita Masako and she was wanted for

965
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:47,666
killing her colleague when she was working in a nightclub

966
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:49,874
Is this another case

967
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:52,338
of punishment from Kira?

968
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:59,223
We found Wakita's address and tried to interview her

969
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:01,215
but she died in front of us

970
01:12:01,967 --> 01:12:04,372
Ms. Takada, you must be shocked

971
01:12:05,053 --> 01:12:07,055
She did not have any health problem

972
01:12:07,055 --> 01:12:11,014
so it is natural to think that she was killed by Kira

973
01:12:12,451 --> 01:12:14,378
Now please look at this graph

974
01:12:15,353 --> 01:12:18,535
This is the result of a poll taken from 1000 people in Japan

975
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:21,069
According to the result,

976
01:12:21,069 --> 01:12:23,550
60% of them are supporting Kira

977
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:25,038
This is surprising isn't it?

978
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:26,409
I don't think so

979
01:12:27,075 --> 01:12:29,077
Considering that the crime rate has been decreasing

980
01:12:31,884 --> 01:12:34,038
by the appearance of Kira, this result is expected

981
01:12:37,052 --> 01:12:39,020
Not bad

982
01:12:40,603 --> 01:12:43,430
This is a fact that Kira is fighting against evil

983
01:12:44,830 --> 01:12:47,007
What is the true justice?

984
01:12:47,953 --> 01:12:50,126
Does the police, or L, really can help us?

985
01:12:50,932 --> 01:12:52,585
Kira is trying to make us thing.

986
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,659
She's good

987
01:12:57,072 --> 01:12:59,092
We can't blame her because

988
01:13:00,340 --> 01:13:03,536
We haven't found any clues to go on

989
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,024
What's wrong Ryuzaki?
It's not like you

990
01:13:08,574 --> 01:13:10,542
Oh, great work!

991
01:13:12,105 --> 01:13:13,118
Thank you for supervising

992
01:13:13,406 --> 01:13:14,893
Your comments were witty

993
01:13:16,845 --> 01:13:17,843
Thank you so much!

994
01:13:19,010 --> 01:13:20,420
The director said that...

995
01:13:21,062 --> 01:13:22,966
you'd be a good anchor

996
01:13:23,642 --> 01:13:24,286
Really?

997
01:13:25,088 --> 01:13:28,222
for being critical towards the society through Kira's case...

998
01:13:28,645 --> 01:13:31,778
Your brave, intelligent attitude has attracted the viewers.

999
01:13:33,699 --> 01:13:35,841
You're becoming more attractive

1000
01:13:36,943 --> 01:13:37,930
Mr. Demegawa!

1001
01:13:41,026 --> 01:13:43,022
Could you ask your boss?

1002
01:13:44,032 --> 01:13:46,048
to spray pesticide in the studio

1003
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:49,016
since a noisy bug's flying around here

1004
01:13:49,637 --> 01:13:50,786
Saeko!

1005
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:52,391
Let's go have dinner?

1006
01:13:54,908 --> 01:13:55,737
Kiyomi

1007
01:13:56,655 --> 01:13:58,741
You know, each employee has an appropriate role, right?

1008
01:13:59,028 --> 01:14:00,367
What is your role, then?

1009
01:14:01,531 --> 01:14:03,824
No one's listening to your trashy comments!

1010
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:05,444
Let's go

1011
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,110
I say she's too fugly to be the anchor for our show!

1012
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:17,711
Oh, come on

1013
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,873
We employees can't say no to your boss, you know.

1014
01:14:21,590 --> 01:14:22,835
Are you kidding me?

1015
01:14:23,058 --> 01:14:25,821
You're the one who said no to your boss and showed Kira's video!

1016
01:14:26,906 --> 01:14:28,321
You slept with her, didn't you?

1017
01:14:29,578 --> 01:14:32,898
There's nobody but you who got a job by sleeping with me

1018
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:35,863
Stop the car

1019
01:14:35,864 --> 01:14:36,832
Huh?

1020
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:38,499
Stop the car now!

1021
01:14:47,465 --> 01:14:48,824
I'll never forgive her!

1022
01:14:50,074 --> 01:14:50,814
Hey, wait!

1023
01:14:51,803 --> 01:14:52,722
Calm down!

1024
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:55,458
What's the matter with you!

1025
01:14:59,419 --> 01:15:01,594
You can't catch a taxi here!

1026
01:15:17,617 --> 01:15:18,711
Good evening

1027
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:22,913
Good evening

1028
01:15:23,360 --> 01:15:26,733
Welcome to Evening Spot,
I'm Takada Kiyomi, the new anchor

1029
01:15:28,528 --> 01:15:29,470
First of all,

1030
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:32,754
I have to announce a sad news

1031
01:15:34,566 --> 01:15:38,570
Last night, Nishiyama Saeko, our excellent former anchor,

1032
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:40,631
died of a car accident

1033
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,038
She was, for me..

1034
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,685
a few years senior than me

1035
01:15:47,075 --> 01:15:50,496
and one of the person I respected the most

1036
01:15:52,488 --> 01:15:55,457
It is very sad that...

1037
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:58,418
my first job as an anchor is

1038
01:15:59,910 --> 01:16:01,621
to announce about Saeko's death

1039
01:16:06,412 --> 01:16:09,058
This feels like being on a honeymoon!

1040
01:16:11,065 --> 01:16:14,068
If I can always spend my time with you like this

1041
01:16:14,068 --> 01:16:16,184
I won't want to go back to work

1042
01:16:19,073 --> 01:16:24,131
But, if they lock me up again, I'll die!

1043
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:26,536
Oh, sorry!

1044
01:16:31,052 --> 01:16:32,405
Light

1045
01:16:33,054 --> 01:16:33,694
Are you studying?

1046
01:16:33,694 --> 01:16:36,107
Sorry Misa, can you please leave me alone for a while?

1047
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:55,491
I'll go downstairs

1048
01:16:56,424 --> 01:16:57,399
Dont leave me alone

1049
01:17:03,573 --> 01:17:05,533
Light, come back soon, okay?

1050
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:08,856
I'm sorry, but I'll set you free soon

1051
01:17:23,448 --> 01:17:25,316
Ryuzaki is a little depressed

1052
01:17:26,004 --> 01:17:28,484
Yeah, because he lost all his clues...

1053
01:17:30,540 --> 01:17:31,968
You're too loud

1054
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:33,331
Ryuzaki!

1055
01:17:34,048 --> 01:17:35,061
Please be honest

1056
01:17:35,519 --> 01:17:37,653
What is the percentage that I'm Kira?

1057
01:17:39,053 --> 01:17:42,173
The percentage that you are Kira is...

1058
01:17:42,944 --> 01:17:43,934
nearly zero

1059
01:17:44,842 --> 01:17:45,320
I see

1060
01:17:47,061 --> 01:17:47,802
Great

1061
01:17:48,446 --> 01:17:49,197
I'm so happy

1062
01:17:50,064 --> 01:17:54,068
I'm also happy that you don't seem to be Kira, but

1063
01:17:55,234 --> 01:17:57,577
at the same time I lost all the clues

1064
01:17:59,028 --> 01:18:00,655
There's a vital clue

1065
01:18:01,622 --> 01:18:02,505
What if I said so?

1066
01:18:04,176 --> 01:18:05,735
When will you come back?

1067
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:07,266
Are you serious?

1068
01:18:08,049 --> 01:18:08,901
Look at this

1069
01:18:13,054 --> 01:18:15,720
The red one is Kira's action before I was confined

1070
01:18:16,439 --> 01:18:17,742
and the blue one is his new action.

1071
01:18:17,058 --> 01:18:20,909
I profiled them statistically

1072
01:18:21,062 --> 01:18:24,060
Are these the same person?

1073
01:18:24,065 --> 01:18:25,049
No

1074
01:18:25,385 --> 01:18:27,060
They have some differences

1075
01:18:33,446 --> 01:18:34,643
Oh, they really do!

1076
01:18:36,077 --> 01:18:39,080
Even if you try to imitate someone's movement

1077
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:40,998
you can't hide your habits or personality

1078
01:18:42,014 --> 01:18:44,551
They appear to be a remarkable tendency

1079
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:46,230
Ryuzaki...

1080
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:48,088
He's got the energy again!

1081
01:18:48,283 --> 01:18:49,218
I bet you know it

1082
01:18:50,334 --> 01:18:53,271
If Kira before and after the restraint were the same person

1083
01:18:53,271 --> 01:18:55,545
THe distribution wouldn't be so different

1084
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,998
It means that they are different person and

1085
01:18:59,067 --> 01:19:01,673
we can see the distinct characterists that show their tendencies

1086
01:19:03,071 --> 01:19:04,016
How is it , Ryuzaki?

1087
01:19:05,031 --> 01:19:05,789
Doesn't it give you some motivation?

1088
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:08,871
Yes Light, that you so much

1089
01:19:10,331 --> 01:19:11,574
By the way, what are the characteristics?

1090
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:15,529
Well, the first characteristic is publicity

1091
01:19:15,763 --> 01:19:20,392
I mean, the new Kira cares slightly more about cases featured by the media

1092
01:19:21,326 --> 01:19:22,999
And the second factor is

1093
01:19:23,034 --> 01:19:24,577
gender

1094
01:19:24,772 --> 01:19:29,414
The new one focuses on more cases related to women

1095
01:19:30,315 --> 01:19:31,893
This Kira may be a woman

1096
01:19:32,596 --> 01:19:34,065
And the third factor is...

1097
01:19:35,483 --> 01:19:37,956
which might be the answer already

1098
01:19:38,486 --> 01:19:39,816
What? Oh come one Light, tell us

1099
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:43,322
frequency of the cases reported by one broadcasting company

1100
01:19:44,167 --> 01:19:45,865
Which company?

1101
01:19:47,462 --> 01:19:48,654
It's Sakura TV

1102
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:54,469
To sum up

1103
01:19:55,339 --> 01:19:58,432
compared to the First Kira, this new Kira is

1104
01:19:59,151 --> 01:20:04,342
more media-oriented, feminine, and Sakura TV...

1105
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:09,743
The anchor died of accident and the new one is female!

1106
01:21:21,219 --> 01:21:24,256
Does she keep a diary in such an old notebook?

1107
01:21:21,219 --> 01:21:22,875
That's not snobbish people do

1108
01:21:23,274 --> 01:21:24,566
She must have a lot of money

1109
01:21:25,019 --> 01:21:28,748
I don't think it's a diary. SHe's copying down from the PC screen

1110
01:21:29,929 --> 01:21:31,749
Can you zoom in the surface of the notebook?

1111
01:21:31,784 --> 01:21:33,434
Okay, wait a second

1112
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:46,431
What are these£¿

1113
01:21:47,988 --> 01:21:51,690
Names of the criminals who've just been killed by Kira

1114
01:21:51,725 --> 01:21:56,146
Ms. Sagami, capture them and confirm that they are

1115
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:57,734
Yes

1116
01:22:00,461 --> 01:22:03,432
Killing one after another everyday

1117
01:22:03,871 --> 01:22:06,465
Are there any left to kill?

1118
01:22:07,367 --> 01:22:09,661
It tells you how sinful human beings are

1119
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:13,388
Look who's talking

1120
01:22:13,388 --> 01:22:14,407
I know

1121
01:22:15,354 --> 01:22:17,556
Punishing the sinful people, I'm even more sinful

1122
01:22:18,693 --> 01:22:21,263
But even those sins burden me for my entire life

1123
01:22:21,589 --> 01:22:23,018
I have to fulfill my duty

1124
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:25,068
Is she talking to herself?

1125
01:22:25,244 --> 01:22:25,814
No,

1126
01:22:26,659 --> 01:22:28,246
She's definitely talking to someone else

1127
01:22:34,004 --> 01:22:35,226
It's confirmed

1128
01:22:36,363 --> 01:22:38,616
Names of the left page belong to the criminals

1129
01:22:39,467 --> 01:22:41,881
who died of heart attack yesterday

1130
01:22:42,622 --> 01:22:44,177
Accurate details of when and how they died..

1131
01:22:43,471 --> 01:22:46,660
including the unannounced cases

1132
01:22:47,322 --> 01:22:48,719
We got it!

1133
01:22:49,270 --> 01:22:51,321
Boss! Let me arrest her!

1134
01:22:51,495 --> 01:22:54,576
She can make an excuse that she was just researching their deaths

1135
01:22:55,898 --> 01:22:56,925
You're right...

1136
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:57,842
One more thing

1137
01:22:58,790 --> 01:23:01,980
What she's writing down on the right page now..

1138
01:23:02,337 --> 01:23:04,029
are also names of the criminals

1139
01:23:05,006 --> 01:23:06,938
but they are still alive

1140
01:23:08,994 --> 01:23:11,346
They must be the next targets

1141
01:23:12,644 --> 01:23:15,483
If they really die tomorrow, we can conclude that she's Kira

1142
01:23:16,225 --> 01:23:19,611
or she has some kind of relationship with Kira

1143
01:23:20,224 --> 01:23:22,279
We can't just wait until those people die!

1144
01:23:23,266 --> 01:23:24,996
Damn it, what should we do!

1145
01:23:25,504 --> 01:23:27,046
We can use Kira's cruelty

1146
01:23:30,063 --> 01:23:31,546
Hello, Ms. Takada

1147
01:23:32,511 --> 01:23:36,425
You keep getting scoops about Kira as a supporter

1148
01:23:37,717 --> 01:23:40,355
I found out the reasons

1149
01:23:40,720 --> 01:23:41,920
What do you mean?

1150
01:23:42,688 --> 01:23:45,085
I peeked in your room

1151
01:23:46,692 --> 01:23:48,063
It's illegal!

1152
01:23:48,063 --> 01:23:51,443
Every secret is hidden in your black notebook, right?

1153
01:23:52,022 --> 01:23:53,786
I want you to buy the tapes

1154
01:23:54,504 --> 01:23:55,446
for 5 million yen

1155
01:24:36,252 --> 01:24:38,254
All the names she wrote down yesterday...

1156
01:24:38,474 --> 01:24:40,485
matches the criminals who died today.

1157
01:24:41,012 --> 01:24:42,779
Takada Kiyomi is the Kira!

1158
01:24:43,014 --> 01:24:44,142
She definitely is!

1159
01:24:54,993 --> 01:24:56,146
I'm the one who called you

1160
01:25:03,293 --> 01:25:04,283
"Miatsuo Yosuke"

1161
01:25:04,318 --> 01:25:08,592
If I die, the tapes will automatically go public

1162
01:25:09,332 --> 01:25:12,335
Are you doing this with someone else?

1163
01:25:12,010 --> 01:25:13,605
No, I'm alone

1164
01:25:16,769 --> 01:25:19,734
There's my account number on the back of the card

1165
01:25:20,018 --> 01:25:22,994
Transfer 5 million yen to my account

1166
01:25:23,988 --> 01:25:25,990
Once payment is confirmed

1167
01:25:25,990 --> 01:25:27,703
I'll give you the tapes

1168
01:25:28,993 --> 01:25:30,459
Thank you

1169
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:39,069
It's me. Kiyomi. turn on the TV

1170
01:25:39,299 --> 01:25:40,311
Sakura TV

1171
01:25:41,005 --> 01:25:41,962
Why?

1172
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:44,118
No reason, just turn on the TV

1173
01:25:50,105 --> 01:25:52,461
Kira is a woman?

1174
01:25:53,017 --> 01:25:55,488
Wow, I couldn't think of it

1175
01:25:55,726 --> 01:25:56,445
"Special Program: Chasing Kira's Identity"

1176
01:25:56,878 --> 01:25:59,178
I have the tapes as evidence

1177
01:25:59,386 --> 01:26:01,860
Wait, It's too soon to show them

1178
01:26:02,994 --> 01:26:05,858
We'll show you the videos at the end of the program

1179
01:26:06,998 --> 01:26:08,646
You'll see Kira's identity

1180
01:26:09,819 --> 01:26:12,374
1 hour 25 minutes and 40 seconds left

1181
01:26:13,004 --> 01:26:15,414
until then, we'll ask our guests some more questions

1182
01:26:15,449 --> 01:26:17,687
We were scooped by other guys

1183
01:26:18,620 --> 01:26:20,946
I'm sorry...
I'll call you back

1184
01:26:22,013 --> 01:26:22,949
"that female..."

1185
01:26:26,619 --> 01:26:27,826
I did it as you said

1186
01:26:28,870 --> 01:26:29,885
You're a good actor

1187
01:26:38,934 --> 01:26:39,948
Now, what do we do next?

1188
01:26:45,578 --> 01:26:48,008
"Matsuo Yosuke suicide"

1189
01:26:49,006 --> 01:26:51,598
22:36, refuses to appear on the program

1190
01:26:54,032 --> 01:26:57,602
after cleaning out all the evidences he has

1191
01:26:58,488 --> 01:27:00,910
jumps from the roof of the building

1192
01:27:03,578 --> 01:27:05,048
she's writing down how he's going to die

1193
01:27:05,990 --> 01:27:08,473
Kira can control the action of the people she's going to kill!

1194
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:12,359
It's safe, Rem

1195
01:27:13,900 --> 01:27:14,893
"Now it's safe"

1196
01:27:16,371 --> 01:27:17,393
what is she talking about?

1197
01:27:18,452 --> 01:27:23,695
Does she really believe that Matsuda will act according to what she's written?

1198
01:27:28,267 --> 01:27:32,302
Are you for or against Kira's actions?

1199
01:27:33,162 --> 01:27:34,119
Don't you see?

1200
01:27:34,798 --> 01:27:37,433
If I supported Kira, I wouldn't appear on TV like this

1201
01:27:38,701 --> 01:27:40,007
Don't you think it's dangerous?

1202
01:27:40,007 --> 01:27:41,346
It's a minute past the time....

1203
01:27:41,902 --> 01:27:42,989
Rem, what's going on?

1204
01:27:44,512 --> 01:27:45,023
"Rem.."

1205
01:27:46,628 --> 01:27:47,929
What is "Rem"?

1206
01:27:48,345 --> 01:27:49,031
Who is she talking to?

1207
01:27:53,256 --> 01:27:54,507
A Death God?

1208
01:27:56,987 --> 01:28:00,542
"Matsuo Yosuke"
It must be a false name!

1209
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:04,024
Rem! You must've known it since you're the Death God!

1210
01:28:04,059 --> 01:28:05,983
You didn't tell me!

1211
01:28:06,725 --> 01:28:10,198
She often says "Death God"

1212
01:28:10,233 --> 01:28:11,723
Is it a code or something?

1213
01:28:12,990 --> 01:28:14,958
The most logical way is to think that

1214
01:28:16,386 --> 01:28:17,759
the Death God exists

1215
01:28:18,911 --> 01:28:19,570
What?

1216
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:20,863
Okay

1217
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:23,254
Let's make a deal

1218
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:25,610
Give me the Death God's eyes!

1219
01:28:30,593 --> 01:28:32,711
The Death God's eyes...?

1220
01:28:36,351 --> 01:28:37,918
The Second Kira said the same thing

1221
01:28:39,602 --> 01:28:41,583
The Second Kira has the ability to kill only by the faces

1222
01:28:43,371 --> 01:28:44,824
That's "the Death God's eye"

1223
01:29:59,262 --> 01:29:59,726
Roll down the window

1224
01:30:05,593 --> 01:30:06,486
Show me your ID

1225
01:30:08,783 --> 01:30:09,612
You don't have it?

1226
01:30:11,224 --> 01:30:13,927
Don't look at me like that, the rule is the rule

1227
01:30:15,579 --> 01:30:17,625
Shidohara Genta

1228
01:30:19,596 --> 01:30:20,552
How did you know my name?

1229
01:30:24,732 --> 01:30:25,500
Wait!

1230
01:30:26,536 --> 01:30:28,515
Do you appear on TV?

1231
01:30:30,223 --> 01:30:31,726
Something TV...

1232
01:30:32,738 --> 01:30:33,893
You're an anchor, right?

1233
01:30:35,266 --> 01:30:36,167
What are you doing?

1234
01:30:36,846 --> 01:30:37,769
Wait!

1235
01:31:11,930 --> 01:31:15,017
A policeman fell down, but I can't help him!

1236
01:31:15,744 --> 01:31:16,405
Got it

1237
01:31:17,746 --> 01:31:18,551
Did she use "the eye"?

1238
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:21,425
It's too dangerous to let her go any further

1239
01:31:22,397 --> 01:31:26,788
We don't know how she did it, but it's better to catch her

1240
01:32:19,260 --> 01:32:20,401
Freeze!

1241
01:32:26,629 --> 01:32:27,931
Let me go!

1242
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:42,612
Let me go!

1243
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:54,149
We have watched every single action you made

1244
01:32:56,391 --> 01:32:58,556
The TV program was a fake

1245
01:33:00,227 --> 01:33:01,033
It was a trap!

1246
01:33:01,395 --> 01:33:02,300
Takada Kiyomi!

1247
01:33:04,329 --> 01:33:05,870
How did you do that?

1248
01:33:07,401 --> 01:33:08,564
Are you a detective?

1249
01:33:08,871 --> 01:33:09,348
As Kira..

1250
01:33:10,561 --> 01:33:11,934
How did you kill those people?

1251
01:33:14,375 --> 01:33:16,153
You wrote the names on the notebook

1252
01:33:21,382 --> 01:33:23,931
After writing them down.. what did you do?

1253
01:33:26,187 --> 01:33:27,016
I just write them down

1254
01:33:27,388 --> 01:33:28,921
I said what did you do after!

1255
01:33:31,391 --> 01:33:32,675
Then why don't you try it?

1256
01:33:38,399 --> 01:33:40,401
You write names down and...

1257
01:33:40,904 --> 01:33:42,254
the person whose name is written dies

1258
01:33:43,077 --> 01:33:44,050
The notebook of the Death God

1259
01:33:57,805 --> 01:33:59,729
What the...

1260
01:34:01,389 --> 01:34:02,796
Dad, what's wrong?

1261
01:34:12,400 --> 01:34:15,211
When you touch it, you can see the Death God?

1262
01:34:23,164 --> 01:34:25,025
Ryuzaki, let me touch it!

1263
01:34:41,582 --> 01:34:43,673
Light... are you okay?

1264
01:34:45,399 --> 01:34:47,367
yeah

1265
01:34:52,282 --> 01:34:53,044
I won!

1266
01:34:53,963 --> 01:34:55,440
Everything's under control

1267
01:34:59,380 --> 01:35:03,654
If only I touch the Death Note, my memory will come back

1268
01:35:04,385 --> 01:35:05,344
Is this really true?

1269
01:35:06,114 --> 01:35:06,759
Yes, but

1270
01:35:07,294 --> 01:35:11,048
you can remember it only when you touch the Death Note

1271
01:35:11,048 --> 01:35:14,418
if the Note wasn't the one you used before

1272
01:35:14,606 --> 01:35:18,883
But if I keep the ownership, the memory won't be lost right?

1273
01:35:20,706 --> 01:35:22,285
How can I keep the ownership?

1274
01:35:22,370 --> 01:35:26,622
While you have the memory, kill the former owner

1275
01:35:27,272 --> 01:35:30,238
Good.
That explanation is enough

1276
01:35:30,965 --> 01:35:31,682
Rem

1277
01:35:32,214 --> 01:35:34,182
Give this to the Third Kira

1278
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:37,416
If you're the Death God, you can find a suitable one

1279
01:35:38,134 --> 01:35:42,060
And after 13 days, let that person resume Kira's job

1280
01:35:42,714 --> 01:35:44,151
I can choose anyone?

1281
01:35:45,177 --> 01:35:49,829
As you won't remember, you can't reach the new owner

1282
01:35:50,642 --> 01:35:53,470
I know about my ability more than anyone else

1283
01:35:54,402 --> 01:35:57,392
I will definitely try hard to find the new Kira

1284
01:35:57,865 --> 01:35:58,884
and catch the person!

1285
01:36:00,043 --> 01:36:03,694
I'll touch the Note before L, or at the same time

1286
01:36:05,379 --> 01:36:06,373
And one more thing

1287
01:36:07,381 --> 01:36:09,878
I have something I want you to write down on the Note

1288
01:36:10,384 --> 01:36:11,602
What is it?

1289
01:36:13,387 --> 01:36:14,416
I've made up

1290
01:36:16,329 --> 01:36:17,995
a false rule of the Death Note

1291
01:36:31,142 --> 01:36:32,715
The Death God exists

1292
01:36:32,715 --> 01:36:34,120
That explains everything

1293
01:36:34,317 --> 01:36:37,009
Now I know how they kill

1294
01:36:37,963 --> 01:36:39,570
If you write down a person's name on the notebook

1295
01:36:40,382 --> 01:36:42,010
that person dies!

1296
01:36:43,172 --> 01:36:44,712
Is this correct. Takada Kiyomi?

1297
01:36:47,388 --> 01:36:50,366
The Death God...
The killer notebook...

1298
01:36:51,392 --> 01:36:54,293
Who will believe this?

1299
01:36:55,091 --> 01:36:57,873
We can't judge her with the current laws!

1300
01:36:58,399 --> 01:36:59,461
That's right

1301
01:36:59,695 --> 01:37:01,414
I didn't kill anybody

1302
01:37:02,308 --> 01:37:03,943
I just wrote down the names

1303
01:37:04,851 --> 01:37:05,302
No

1304
01:37:06,434 --> 01:37:08,777
If we can prove that the notebook kills people

1305
01:37:09,862 --> 01:37:11,003
You'll be guilty

1306
01:37:11,821 --> 01:37:12,498
Death Penalty

1307
01:37:20,387 --> 01:37:22,389
Humans, listen!

1308
01:37:23,933 --> 01:37:26,354
I'm the Death God, Rem

1309
01:37:27,124 --> 01:37:30,033
Only the humans who touched the Death Note can see me

1310
01:37:30,474 --> 01:37:33,168
I can see your lifespan

1311
01:37:34,029 --> 01:37:36,872
And I can take your lives away

1312
01:37:38,372 --> 01:37:42,331
So you'd better not make me angry

1313
01:37:43,985 --> 01:37:47,371
The Death Note has the power of the Death God

1314
01:37:48,382 --> 01:37:50,377
That woman is correct

1315
01:37:50,384 --> 01:37:54,434
the humans whose name is written on the Death Note shall die

1316
01:37:55,064 --> 01:37:56,397
"Takada Kiyomi"

1317
01:37:56,602 --> 01:38:00,909
With so called Death Note you can control the dying situations, can't you?

1318
01:38:03,604 --> 01:38:05,634
Why don't you try it yourself

1319
01:38:06,402 --> 01:38:08,570
by writing her name on the Note?

1320
01:38:09,404 --> 01:38:11,014
Rem, what do you...

1321
01:38:31,001 --> 01:38:31,414
Takada!

1322
01:38:39,927 --> 01:38:40,812
She's dead...

1323
01:38:45,222 --> 01:38:47,225
Light, hand me the notebook

1324
01:39:05,392 --> 01:39:06,719
Overall

1325
01:39:07,261 --> 01:39:09,611
Why did Takada Kiyomi die?

1326
01:39:10,397 --> 01:39:12,816
Accidental heart attack or...

1327
01:39:13,283 --> 01:39:14,000
suicide...?

1328
01:39:15,654 --> 01:39:16,764
Killed by other Kira?

1329
01:39:18,372 --> 01:39:20,340
What do you think, Death God?

1330
01:39:20,988 --> 01:39:22,247
Don't ask me

1331
01:39:25,579 --> 01:39:29,108
The name on the notebook and the dead criminals are the same, but

1332
01:39:29,314 --> 01:39:31,277
there's no name before Light's confinement

1333
01:39:33,387 --> 01:39:34,558
What do you think?

1334
01:39:35,067 --> 01:39:39,291
The owner of the Note might die when the ownership moves to the other

1335
01:39:40,233 --> 01:39:42,244
The First and the Second Kira might have already...

1336
01:39:43,397 --> 01:39:45,043
I see. Now Takada has died

1337
01:39:45,893 --> 01:39:49,109
and the ownership of this notebook has transferred to someone else

1338
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:50,727
What do you think, Death God?

1339
01:39:51,526 --> 01:39:52,474
Don't ask me

1340
01:39:53,624 --> 01:39:55,998
Who owns the Note now?

1341
01:39:56,858 --> 01:39:57,858
I cannot answer

1342
01:39:59,084 --> 01:40:01,463
Is that the only thing you can say?

1343
01:40:02,115 --> 01:40:02,966
By the way

1344
01:40:05,311 --> 01:40:08,193
about the last rule of this Death Note

1345
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:14,788
"If the owner does not write any name for 13 days"

1346
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,328
"the owner shall die"

1347
01:40:17,898 --> 01:40:21,857
Considering this rule, the former Kiras have died

1348
01:40:22,414 --> 01:40:24,879
Then Light, who was under surveillance for 18 days?

1349
01:40:25,068 --> 01:40:29,166
and Amane, which was 23 days, are completely innocent

1350
01:40:29,698 --> 01:40:30,777
Death God!

1351
01:40:32,866 --> 01:40:36,331
Are all the rules on this notebook true?

1352
01:40:38,847 --> 01:40:40,544
Yes, they are

1353
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:47,123
I got it, Light and Misa are free now

1354
01:40:48,927 --> 01:40:51,430
Light, call your mother and go home

1355
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:51,948
Dad!

1356
01:40:52,402 --> 01:40:55,530
I'd like to stay here and continue working..

1357
01:40:56,437 --> 01:40:57,516
I think I have to

1358
01:40:59,241 --> 01:40:59,797
Ryuzaki

1359
01:41:01,496 --> 01:41:02,752
You need me, don't you?

1360
01:41:04,445 --> 01:41:08,650
I got it.
Light, stay here and help us

1361
01:41:09,637 --> 01:41:11,860
This looks like a common notebook

1362
01:41:12,561 --> 01:41:15,269
I can't believe this thing can kill people

1363
01:41:16,118 --> 01:41:16,804
What?

1364
01:41:17,152 --> 01:41:19,064
Why don't you come with me?

1365
01:41:19,256 --> 01:41:20,684
You can come whenever you want

1366
01:41:21,266 --> 01:41:22,292
Ryuzaki will allow us

1367
01:41:22,984 --> 01:41:24,371
to just talk at the entrance

1368
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,121
Right, I'll come see you everyday

1369
01:41:27,824 --> 01:41:28,564
Be prepared!

1370
01:41:35,429 --> 01:41:36,225
Misa...

1371
01:41:36,784 --> 01:41:37,867
Listen quietly

1372
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,543
Will you do me a favor?

1373
01:41:45,173 --> 01:41:46,243
What is it?

1374
01:41:59,505 --> 01:42:00,485
It's here!

1375
01:42:41,175 --> 01:42:42,862
Light is the Kira...

1376
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:46,551
He's my God!

1377
01:42:49,928 --> 01:42:51,343
So happy

1378
01:42:52,670 --> 01:42:54,275
My Light is the Kira...!

1379
01:42:57,279 --> 01:43:00,201
I'm back at last!

1380
01:43:01,990 --> 01:43:02,828
Ryuk!

1381
01:43:04,613 --> 01:43:05,713
Why are you here?

1382
01:43:06,615 --> 01:43:08,870
That Death Note is mine

1383
01:43:09,911 --> 01:43:11,857
So this time I'll follow you

1384
01:43:13,164 --> 01:43:16,002
Don't worry, your memory won't be gone

1385
01:43:16,285 --> 01:43:19,659
If you become the owner of this Note

1386
01:43:22,173 --> 01:43:23,611
Okay, I'll be the owner

1387
01:43:25,176 --> 01:43:26,444
Oh, I almost forgot!

1388
01:43:31,182 --> 01:43:31,909
Here

1389
01:43:32,266 --> 01:43:33,266
A gift from Light!

1390
01:43:35,186 --> 01:43:36,535
App.. Apple

1391
01:43:36,879 --> 01:43:38,946
Oh Light... !
He's more generous than he looks!

1392
01:43:42,489 --> 01:43:43,070
"Dear Misa"

1393
01:43:44,162 --> 01:43:49,066
"When you read this letter, you must've remembered everything."

1394
01:43:50,168 --> 01:43:52,680
"To create an ideal world together."

1395
01:43:53,319 --> 01:43:55,850
"You must resume punishing instead of me."

1396
01:43:57,651 --> 01:43:58,343
"And one more thing."

1397
01:43:59,143 --> 01:44:03,575
"do you remember the guy named Ryuzaki I introduced you at my college?"

1398
01:44:04,688 --> 01:44:07,617
"He's our enemy, L"

1399
01:44:09,187 --> 01:44:10,102
That guy is L?

1400
01:44:11,082 --> 01:44:15,018
"You must've seen his real name with your Death God's eye."

1401
01:44:16,161 --> 01:44:18,432
"Write down the name on the Death Note"

1402
01:44:18,803 --> 01:44:20,150
"and eliminate L."

1403
01:44:24,855 --> 01:44:26,253
Elminate L...

1404
01:44:40,184 --> 01:44:40,859
Damn it!

1405
01:44:42,187 --> 01:44:44,045
I can't remember it!

1406
01:44:46,011 --> 01:44:49,947
I saw names of hundreds of people everyday

1407
01:44:51,452 --> 01:44:55,411
Once you discard the ownership, you lose the ability of "the eye"

1408
01:44:56,167 --> 01:44:58,253
I'm sorry, Misa

1409
01:45:01,672 --> 01:45:03,037
Ryuk

1410
01:45:05,392 --> 01:45:06,885
Make the eye-deal again

1411
01:45:07,458 --> 01:45:08,394
Are you sure?

1412
01:45:09,767 --> 01:45:11,880
You've already lost half of your lifespan

1413
01:45:12,554 --> 01:45:14,218
You'll lose the half of if

1414
01:45:14,685 --> 01:45:16,810
I know!

1415
01:45:18,159 --> 01:45:21,043
I don't want to lose my face!

1416
01:45:21,659 --> 01:45:22,199
Face....

1417
01:45:23,652 --> 01:45:25,054
but you have the face.

1418
01:45:25,813 --> 01:45:27,250
Don't take it literally!

1419
01:45:29,338 --> 01:45:31,844
Well, I don't understand human mind really...

1420
01:45:32,290 --> 01:45:34,205
You want the Death God's eye

1421
01:45:38,676 --> 01:45:40,756
I have to obey Light...

1422
01:45:51,538 --> 01:45:53,381
Just one week after Takada's death...

1423
01:45:55,595 --> 01:45:57,198
The new Kira has appeared!

1424
01:45:58,492 --> 01:45:59,729
Criminals are being killed again

1425
01:46:00,448 --> 01:46:03,344
It means there are more notebooks

1426
01:46:04,669 --> 01:46:05,593
Just after,

1427
01:46:07,008 --> 01:46:08,460
Amane Misa was freed

1428
01:46:09,642 --> 01:46:10,232
Ryuzaki!

1429
01:46:11,190 --> 01:46:12,060
Don't give me that again!

1430
01:46:12,305 --> 01:46:14,716
Don't you remember the 13 day rule?

1431
01:46:15,306 --> 01:46:15,944
Mr Yagami

1432
01:46:17,236 --> 01:46:18,035
What?

1433
01:46:18,070 --> 01:46:21,632
Let's inspect this notebook

1434
01:46:23,531 --> 01:46:27,231
I'll ask FBI and have them provide us with two prisoners from the death row

1435
01:46:27,692 --> 01:46:30,034
We'll make the prisoners A write the name of the B

1436
01:46:30,484 --> 01:46:31,484
to see if B will die

1437
01:46:33,555 --> 01:46:37,514
then leave A from the Note for 13 days to see if A will die

1438
01:46:38,669 --> 01:46:42,585
I can't believe you treat human lives like bugs

1439
01:46:43,674 --> 01:46:45,342
It can't be helped

1440
01:46:46,210 --> 01:46:48,472
It's to protect thousands of people's lives

1441
01:46:48,679 --> 01:46:49,900
Isn't there any other way?

1442
01:47:10,652 --> 01:47:11,458
Today, again!

1443
01:47:11,797 --> 01:47:13,822
A numerous number of criminals are killed

1444
01:47:19,677 --> 01:47:20,337
Ryuzaki

1445
01:47:21,286 --> 01:47:23,445
You may be right to stop Kira from killing people

1446
01:47:24,829 --> 01:47:27,488
I'll take responsibility for the experiment

1447
01:47:27,685 --> 01:47:29,116
I'll supervise

1448
01:47:30,425 --> 01:47:30,981
Dad..

1449
01:47:32,131 --> 01:47:33,975
Thank you for understanding

1450
01:47:34,692 --> 01:47:36,513
I'll goto the States

1451
01:47:36,661 --> 01:47:38,028
Are you going alone?

1452
01:47:39,067 --> 01:47:40,432
Let me go with you

1453
01:47:40,665 --> 01:47:41,699
No, you can't

1454
01:47:42,667 --> 01:47:45,107
Stay here with Ryuzaki and wait until I contact you

1455
01:47:46,599 --> 01:47:47,811
I'll be fine

1456
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:50,564
Others will come with me, little to worry

1457
01:47:51,130 --> 01:47:52,745
Wait, am I worrying?

1458
01:47:55,152 --> 01:47:55,838
How about here?

1459
01:47:56,261 --> 01:47:57,257
Yes, it is worrying

1460
01:48:02,687 --> 01:48:06,643
First, goto the Tokyo Bay heliport by car

1461
01:48:08,480 --> 01:48:13,804
Then fly to the Yokota Camp. The US army will carry you by plane to Washington D.C.

1462
01:48:15,361 --> 01:48:16,901
Watari has arranged for everything

1463
01:48:17,420 --> 01:48:18,024
I got it

1464
01:48:18,669 --> 01:48:19,997
See you later

1465
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:50,501
Now, we're all alone

1466
01:48:51,669 --> 01:48:53,525
What are you thinking about?

1467
01:48:54,672 --> 01:48:55,888
Right now

1468
01:48:56,415 --> 01:48:58,507
Watari is coming here Amane

1469
01:48:59,936 --> 01:49:01,564
It was your plan!

1470
01:49:02,920 --> 01:49:03,790
Why Misa?

1471
01:49:04,682 --> 01:49:09,399
For some reason, the 13 day rule didn't work for Amane

1472
01:49:10,603 --> 01:49:12,773
Amane is the Second Kira

1473
01:49:13,543 --> 01:49:15,831
And she has another Death Note

1474
01:49:16,263 --> 01:49:18,052
This is what I'm thinking about

1475
01:49:18,993 --> 01:49:24,585
Then why she didn't write your name when she was freed?

1476
01:49:25,097 --> 01:49:29,190
Probably, she forgot my name she saw at the college

1477
01:49:29,759 --> 01:49:31,880
while she was restrained

1478
01:49:33,630 --> 01:49:35,825
Forgetting things is a girl's nature

1479
01:49:39,378 --> 01:49:40,812
I am going to

1480
01:49:40,812 --> 01:49:43,064
show my face to Amane

1481
01:49:45,528 --> 01:49:46,604
What?

1482
01:49:47,321 --> 01:49:48,718
If you do that, she'll...

1483
01:49:49,219 --> 01:49:51,064
Yes, she'll definitely write my name..

1484
01:49:51,064 --> 01:49:53,639
We can catch her when she's done it

1485
01:49:54,157 --> 01:49:57,588
Let's get her Note

1486
01:49:58,622 --> 01:50:00,664
We never know when and when she'll write

1487
01:50:01,068 --> 01:50:04,589
There are millions of cameras in this building

1488
01:50:04,628 --> 01:50:06,679
What if she didn't bring the Note?

1489
01:50:06,679 --> 01:50:08,489
She'll definitely bring it. This is a huge chance

1490
01:50:09,293 --> 01:50:10,663
to kill me

1491
01:50:14,638 --> 01:50:15,454
All right!

1492
01:50:16,282 --> 01:50:18,438
Then we'll catch her, and restrain her again

1493
01:50:18,438 --> 01:50:20,280
until she tells us about the First Kira

1494
01:50:20,783 --> 01:50:21,845
Is that alright?

1495
01:50:22,613 --> 01:50:24,719
We can definitely make her confess

1496
01:50:25,253 --> 01:50:26,253
as we have the evidence

1497
01:50:27,058 --> 01:50:29,867
You shut out the crew to do this, didn't you?

1498
01:50:30,621 --> 01:50:32,498
If she'll be tied like that again

1499
01:50:33,187 --> 01:50:35,292
She may die this time

1500
01:50:36,447 --> 01:50:38,415
I know I feel sorry, but it can't be helped

1501
01:50:48,869 --> 01:50:50,578
What's the matter Death God?

1502
01:51:03,314 --> 01:51:05,568
Ryuzaki asked me to come

1503
01:51:06,326 --> 01:51:09,552
does it mean he doesn't suspect me as Kira anymore?

1504
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:11,277
Of course, he doesn't

1505
01:51:25,642 --> 01:51:26,591
But if...

1506
01:51:27,665 --> 01:51:29,979
I couldn't save your life...

1507
01:51:30,614 --> 01:51:33,046
If my heart stops

1508
01:51:33,617 --> 01:51:35,731
this sensor will automatically alert Mr. Yagami

1509
01:51:36,620 --> 01:51:39,167
I've asked him to burn the Death Note

1510
01:51:39,588 --> 01:51:41,880
to never be used again

1511
01:51:47,081 --> 01:51:49,672
Misa's lifespan has been shortened again

1512
01:51:51,883 --> 01:51:52,723
Lifespan?

1513
01:51:53,439 --> 01:51:54,067
What do you mean?

1514
01:51:54,523 --> 01:51:55,096
Ryuzaki

1515
01:51:56,640 --> 01:51:58,955
If you risk your life I'm prepared too

1516
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,629
Let's catch Amane Misa

1517
01:52:01,664 --> 01:52:04,190
...the Second Kira in the act!

1518
01:52:10,328 --> 01:52:11,000
Here she comes

1519
01:52:33,644 --> 01:52:35,598
Yagami Light....

1520
01:52:36,326 --> 01:52:38,979
You've known that this would happen

1521
01:52:40,035 --> 01:52:44,345
Since when I told you that if a Death God expands lifespan of a human

1522
01:52:44,908 --> 01:52:45,739
the Death God will die

1523
01:52:49,096 --> 01:52:51,110
You drove her intoa a corner

1524
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:52,761
to make me save her

1525
01:52:53,565 --> 01:52:55,716
It will expand her lifespan

1526
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:57,400
and I will die instead

1527
01:52:58,914 --> 01:53:02,465
That's been your plan from that day

1528
01:53:03,621 --> 01:53:06,081
You'll succeed in killing a Death God!

1529
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:09,569
You are the true devil

1530
01:53:11,453 --> 01:53:14,498
But still, Misa loves you

1531
01:53:16,424 --> 01:53:17,604
Yagami Light!

1532
01:53:18,418 --> 01:53:21,488
I'll never let you use my Note!

1533
01:53:22,909 --> 01:53:23,681
Misa...

1534
01:53:24,939 --> 01:53:26,299
Even if a short while...

1535
01:53:26,299 --> 01:53:27,667
be happy...

1536
01:53:44,158 --> 01:53:45,002
Watari...!

1537
01:53:45,608 --> 01:53:46,604
Checkmate..!

1538
01:54:11,591 --> 01:54:12,592
Did you use...

1539
01:54:12,592 --> 01:54:13,564
that Death God...?

1540
01:54:16,287 --> 01:54:18,703
Rem has a gentle heart

1541
01:54:20,897 --> 01:54:22,199
Yagami Light...

1542
01:54:25,622 --> 01:54:26,349
I knew it...

1543
01:54:26,546 --> 01:54:27,750
You are the Kira

1544
01:54:27,965 --> 01:54:29,697
I wanted to know your name

1545
01:54:32,216 --> 01:54:32,973
Loser

1546
01:54:35,216 --> 01:54:36,566
I am

1547
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:39,818
not a...

1548
01:54:48,714 --> 01:54:50,682
Goodbye, L

1549
01:54:52,305 --> 01:54:55,204
You were the best rival

1550
01:54:55,690 --> 01:54:57,157
of me, Kira, the God of the new world.

1551
01:54:58,576 --> 01:55:00,007
If I made a single mistake

1552
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:02,850
I might've been dead too

1553
01:55:04,526 --> 01:55:06,754
It was a high risk to release Misa

1554
01:55:07,996 --> 01:55:12,792
and let her use Death Note instead of me

1555
01:55:15,631 --> 01:55:18,697
Keep watching me achieving the revolution

1556
01:55:20,334 --> 01:55:23,133
Farewell, L.

1557
01:55:25,648 --> 01:55:26,369
I see...

1558
01:55:26,370 --> 01:55:31,563
She burnt the Note with her

1559
01:55:36,469 --> 01:55:37,427
Light!

1560
01:55:37,427 --> 01:55:38,306
You made it!

1561
01:55:38,306 --> 01:55:39,191
Misa, where's the Note?

1562
01:55:45,532 --> 01:55:47,701
So, you killed L!

1563
01:55:47,702 --> 01:55:49,576
Ryuk! How have you been?

1564
01:55:50,158 --> 01:55:51,761
I won, L is dead

1565
01:55:52,344 --> 01:55:53,589
But I still have a job

1566
01:55:59,391 --> 01:56:01,693
"Yagami Soichiro"

1567
01:56:05,245 --> 01:56:06,666
"Heart attack"

1568
01:56:08,081 --> 01:56:09,768
That's your own father's name, Light!

1569
01:56:10,486 --> 01:56:11,914
To create the new world

1570
01:56:13,491 --> 01:56:14,302
But

1571
01:56:17,617 --> 01:56:18,981
He's your father!

1572
01:56:19,827 --> 01:56:20,735
Why!

1573
01:56:20,736 --> 01:56:22,629
Just shut up!

1574
01:56:23,747 --> 01:56:25,202
No matter how you love something,

1575
01:56:26,170 --> 01:56:27,768
there's the time you have make sacrifices

1576
01:56:29,859 --> 01:56:31,503
I cannot be what I used to be

1577
01:56:36,993 --> 01:56:42,203
"Comes back with the Death Note, gives it to Light and dies"

1578
01:57:13,902 --> 01:57:14,617
Dad...

1579
01:57:24,390 --> 01:57:26,195
Give the Death Note back to me

1580
01:57:30,254 --> 01:57:30,983
Dad

1581
01:57:33,303 --> 01:57:35,354
Since we were young

1582
01:57:36,043 --> 01:57:37,609
You don't forgive even the most insignificant injustice

1583
01:57:38,721 --> 01:57:40,215
and try to be our model father

1584
01:57:41,624 --> 01:57:43,637
I respect you so much

1585
01:57:45,378 --> 01:57:47,200
So I'm sure you'll understand

1586
01:57:48,621 --> 01:57:50,148
What I'm going to do

1587
01:57:52,221 --> 01:57:53,285
What I will achieve

1588
01:57:57,583 --> 01:57:58,192
Dad...

1589
01:58:01,587 --> 01:58:04,606
I'm sorry

1590
01:58:05,531 --> 01:58:06,520
It's your time

1591
01:58:19,096 --> 01:58:20,230
Where's the Death Note?

1592
01:58:20,512 --> 01:58:21,041
Light

1593
01:58:23,187 --> 01:58:24,439
I saw everything

1594
01:58:28,958 --> 01:58:30,261
I watched you through the cameras

1595
01:58:32,138 --> 01:58:33,321
and I heard your voice

1596
01:58:34,319 --> 01:58:35,076
What?

1597
01:58:45,464 --> 01:58:46,447
Light!

1598
01:58:48,056 --> 01:58:49,124
Light!

1599
01:58:50,787 --> 01:58:51,679
You're...

1600
01:58:52,897 --> 01:58:53,745
under arrest

1601
01:58:57,576 --> 01:58:59,177
Light,

1602
01:59:01,165 --> 01:59:02,195
I'm so sad

1603
01:59:03,082 --> 01:59:03,824
we couldn't be friends

1604
01:59:07,586 --> 01:59:08,741
Ryuzaki...?

1605
01:59:11,627 --> 01:59:12,583
You...

1606
01:59:14,277 --> 01:59:15,025
Why...

1607
01:59:21,883 --> 01:59:23,245
A fake notebook!

1608
01:59:25,132 --> 01:59:26,159
Misa, you betrayed me!

1609
01:59:27,902 --> 01:59:28,882
No, I didn't

1610
01:59:30,597 --> 01:59:32,548
How can I betray you?

1611
01:59:33,579 --> 01:59:37,149
No matter how evil you are

1612
01:59:38,676 --> 01:59:39,977
I love you!

1613
01:59:43,223 --> 01:59:45,661
She didn't betray you

1614
01:59:47,401 --> 01:59:50,310
It was unexpected that the Death God acted that way

1615
01:59:53,415 --> 01:59:54,885
This is the real one

1616
01:59:55,417 --> 01:59:57,810
Amane Misa digged out

1617
02:00:00,408 --> 02:00:01,361
And this

1618
02:00:02,357 --> 02:00:05,371
is my real name, which you wanted to know

1619
02:00:09,431 --> 02:00:12,876
You can't change what is written in the Death Note

1620
02:00:13,435 --> 02:00:16,728
which means you won't die until the day written first

1621
02:00:17,439 --> 02:00:20,649
I'll die 20 days later

1622
02:00:21,839 --> 02:00:23,894
so you can't kill me now

1623
02:00:25,414 --> 02:00:26,633
when did you switch them?

1624
02:00:27,416 --> 02:00:30,133
The criminals I punished died as planned

1625
02:00:31,420 --> 02:00:32,911
Yes, on the first day

1626
02:00:33,878 --> 02:00:37,504
Then I concluded that you are the Second Kira

1627
02:00:38,427 --> 02:00:40,908
The 13 day rule is also false

1628
02:00:41,430 --> 02:00:44,261
From the second day, Watari switched it into the fake one

1629
02:00:44,983 --> 02:00:47,076
We were watching it

1630
02:00:47,937 --> 02:00:50,219
and told you a false information

1631
02:00:51,150 --> 02:00:54,708
as if the criminals were killed by Kira

1632
02:00:55,251 --> 02:00:57,408
The biggest goal was, Light

1633
02:00:57,684 --> 02:01:00,836
to confirm that you're Kira

1634
02:01:01,666 --> 02:01:03,199
You're a smart boy

1635
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:05,339
You didn't give me any clue

1636
02:01:05,897 --> 02:01:06,921
So I decided

1637
02:01:08,910 --> 02:01:10,868
to give up my own life

1638
02:01:11,674 --> 02:01:15,128
This plan couldn't succeed without Mr. Yagami's cooperation

1639
02:01:16,363 --> 02:01:19,061
He is a very sincere person. At first he refused to do it

1640
02:01:19,873 --> 02:01:22,199
But when I showed him my name written in the Note

1641
02:01:22,654 --> 02:01:24,973
I think he understood that I was serious

1642
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:27,380
Then he finally said yes

1643
02:01:28,311 --> 02:01:30,203
to cooperate with my plan

1644
02:01:32,371 --> 02:01:32,954
He said

1645
02:01:34,354 --> 02:01:35,354
you're not Kira

1646
02:01:36,598 --> 02:01:38,497
he would believe so

1647
02:01:38,940 --> 02:01:40,242
until the last moment

1648
02:01:41,683 --> 02:01:43,578
The cars didn't go to the heliport

1649
02:01:43,578 --> 02:01:45,861
and everyone was watching

1650
02:01:46,492 --> 02:01:48,278
what was happening here

1651
02:02:02,834 --> 02:02:03,873
The saddest thing is

1652
02:02:04,867 --> 02:02:06,510
Watari's death

1653
02:02:07,387 --> 02:02:10,569
I couldn't predict that the Death God would write his name

1654
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:14,096
That was my last mistake

1655
02:02:15,048 --> 02:02:15,974
Light

1656
02:02:16,644 --> 02:02:18,155
I will understand

1657
02:02:19,133 --> 02:02:21,112
what you are going to do

1658
02:02:21,465 --> 02:02:22,410
you said so

1659
02:02:23,988 --> 02:02:24,596
I'm sorry

1660
02:02:25,426 --> 02:02:26,793
I cannot understand at all

1661
02:02:26,794 --> 02:02:28,474
This isn't justice at all

1662
02:02:33,258 --> 02:02:35,114
Before I got the Death Note

1663
02:02:37,029 --> 02:02:40,417
the world was dead, with tons of criminals that current laws can't punish!

1664
02:02:42,764 --> 02:02:44,146
It was so unreasonable!

1665
02:02:46,013 --> 02:02:46,984
You know what happened

1666
02:02:47,822 --> 02:02:50,930
After Kira appeared, the crime rate decreased 70%

1667
02:02:52,444 --> 02:02:54,568
Isn't that what you want?

1668
02:02:56,013 --> 02:02:57,819
to live in such a peaceful world?

1669
02:03:10,774 --> 02:03:12,416
Light!

1670
02:03:17,781 --> 02:03:19,959
A sheet of the Death Note

1671
02:03:19,959 --> 02:03:21,362
I knew you have it

1672
02:03:22,655 --> 02:03:24,092
You killed Takada with that

1673
02:03:26,010 --> 02:03:27,282
At last,

1674
02:03:27,968 --> 02:03:28,910
I found the last piece

1675
02:03:52,006 --> 02:03:54,006
You're right, I'm the Kira

1676
02:03:55,588 --> 02:03:57,634
I'm God of the new world

1677
02:03:58,735 --> 02:03:59,819
No, you're not

1678
02:04:00,548 --> 02:04:02,367
You are just a murderer

1679
02:04:03,604 --> 02:04:05,002
And this notebook is

1680
02:04:05,950 --> 02:04:08,195
The most horrible lethal weapon ever

1681
02:04:09,288 --> 02:04:09,975
L...

1682
02:04:11,604 --> 02:04:14,471
You don't know, since you don't go out of your cozy room

1683
02:04:15,693 --> 02:04:19,649
You don't know that good people are suffering because of evil people in the world!

1684
02:04:20,358 --> 02:04:22,258
There are tons of evil human beings

1685
02:04:22,792 --> 02:04:24,849
who should disappear for the rest of the people!

1686
02:04:25,207 --> 02:04:28,133
It's impossible to save them with the power of the laws

1687
02:04:30,218 --> 02:04:31,398
Yes, it's impossible

1688
02:04:31,917 --> 02:04:33,001
Laws aren't perfect

1689
02:04:34,445 --> 02:04:36,514
because humans, who created laws that aren't perfect

1690
02:04:37,208 --> 02:04:38,285
It's impossible to be perfect

1691
02:04:40,248 --> 02:04:41,349
However,

1692
02:04:41,349 --> 02:04:45,298
the lawas are evidence of human's struggle to be righteous

1693
02:04:47,574 --> 02:04:48,915
You are egotistical

1694
02:04:50,354 --> 02:04:54,342
It must never be allowed to rob someone's life based on ego!

1695
02:04:58,928 --> 02:05:01,005
It's wasteful to talk with you!

1696
02:05:04,171 --> 02:05:04,962
Ryuk!

1697
02:05:07,522 --> 02:05:09,390
Ryuk, where are you

1698
02:05:11,189 --> 02:05:12,325
Hi there

1699
02:05:14,820 --> 02:05:16,144
Oh, another Death God

1700
02:05:17,565 --> 02:05:19,500
Can everyone see it, as you all have touched the Note?

1701
02:05:24,268 --> 02:05:25,058
Ryuk...

1702
02:05:28,190 --> 02:05:30,196
I'll show you something fun

1703
02:05:32,230 --> 02:05:33,585
Kill them all

1704
02:05:35,612 --> 02:05:37,345
Kill them all right now!

1705
02:05:40,054 --> 02:05:40,932
Light!

1706
02:05:41,792 --> 02:05:45,751
What are you waiting for?
Write their names, hurry

1707
02:05:48,381 --> 02:05:50,349
All right, I'll write it down

1708
02:05:51,802 --> 02:05:52,803
Don't!

1709
02:05:52,803 --> 02:05:54,346
Stop!

1710
02:06:12,466 --> 02:06:13,686
It's no use...

1711
02:06:15,515 --> 02:06:16,442
Ryuk...

1712
02:06:16,442 --> 02:06:18,213
Are you done yet?

1713
02:06:18,618 --> 02:06:19,640
yep

1714
02:06:21,752 --> 02:06:22,542
Show me

1715
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:25,439
See

1716
02:06:27,648 --> 02:06:28,648
"Yagami Light"

1717
02:06:36,779 --> 02:06:37,897
Too bad!

1718
02:06:38,558 --> 02:06:40,204
You've been too much

1719
02:06:40,787 --> 02:06:42,305
dependent on me

1720
02:06:43,047 --> 02:06:44,069
Wait...

1721
02:06:44,376 --> 02:06:46,632
I said...
I'd show you something fun!

1722
02:06:49,793 --> 02:06:52,694
You've shown me enough

1723
02:06:53,785 --> 02:06:54,910
You've enjoyed enough too

1724
02:06:55,799 --> 02:06:57,312
What are you talking about!

1725
02:06:57,801 --> 02:06:59,412
Nothing has started yet!

1726
02:07:00,274 --> 02:07:01,898
Oh, I almost forgot to say

1727
02:07:02,853 --> 02:07:04,549
A human who used the Death Note

1728
02:07:05,171 --> 02:07:08,208
cannot goto heaven nor hell

1729
02:07:09,143 --> 02:07:11,247
After you die, you'll see

1730
02:07:13,614 --> 02:07:14,614
nought!

1731
02:07:24,795 --> 02:07:26,485
Light!

1732
02:07:27,798 --> 02:07:29,713
Why, Ryuk, why?

1733
02:07:30,396 --> 02:07:32,080
I can't die here!

1734
02:07:32,593 --> 02:07:34,211
Light!

1735
02:07:37,069 --> 02:07:38,138
Why?

1736
02:07:39,201 --> 02:07:42,318
I was always trying to do the right thing

1737
02:07:43,157 --> 02:07:46,098
You tought me what justice is, Dad

1738
02:07:46,133 --> 02:07:49,743
Why do I have to die like this!

1739
02:08:04,194 --> 02:08:06,433
Kira is, the justice...

1740
02:08:09,182 --> 02:08:09,953
Dad..

1741
02:08:11,822 --> 02:08:14,210
Please understand me...

1742
02:08:19,869 --> 02:08:20,634
Light?

1743
02:08:31,733 --> 02:08:32,797
You idiot..

1744
02:09:07,623 --> 02:09:09,601
I will clean out

1745
02:09:10,506 --> 02:09:12,474
every Death Note

1746
02:09:13,245 --> 02:09:15,096
You don't want to use it?

1747
02:09:16,372 --> 02:09:18,705
Oh, I'm soooo bored!

1748
02:09:48,980 --> 02:09:50,465
I reported the eveen to the superiors

1749
02:09:52,162 --> 02:09:54,481
I couldn't say anything about the Death Note though

1750
02:09:54,934 --> 02:09:57,153
I reported everything to ICPO

1751
02:09:57,853 --> 02:09:59,826
They couldn't understand

1752
02:10:00,934 --> 02:10:03,936
Kira's death won't be announced

1753
02:10:06,342 --> 02:10:08,548
Light was killed by Kira...

1754
02:10:09,035 --> 02:10:10,911
It's the truth

1755
02:10:11,428 --> 02:10:14,334
I told Sachiko and Sayu

1756
02:10:16,230 --> 02:10:18,619
Amane has lost her memory about the Death Note again

1757
02:10:20,022 --> 02:10:22,971
Because we burned both notebooks

1758
02:10:24,197 --> 02:10:25,469
Ryuzaki

1759
02:10:27,805 --> 02:10:29,716
I can't say a word for you

1760
02:10:31,140 --> 02:10:32,009
I'm sorry

1761
02:10:33,548 --> 02:10:34,548
It's me

1762
02:10:35,990 --> 02:10:37,826
who has to apologize

1763
02:10:39,125 --> 02:10:41,011
I couldn't even save Light

1764
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,205
Ryuzaki,

1765
02:10:44,696 --> 02:10:46,374
I'm happy to fight along with you

1766
02:10:47,012 --> 02:10:48,067
I"m proud of you

1767
02:10:50,293 --> 02:10:53,218
It's my time, let me be alone

1768
02:10:56,048 --> 02:10:57,219
I don't know

1769
02:10:59,184 --> 02:11:00,934
What kind of people my parents are

1770
02:11:02,642 --> 02:11:03,783
But I know, Mr. Yagami

1771
02:11:04,504 --> 02:11:06,150
You are a great father

1772
02:11:06,373 --> 02:11:07,148
also to me

1773
02:11:09,161 --> 02:11:10,326
Ryuzaki...

1774
02:11:13,888 --> 02:11:15,635
Goodbye, Mr. Yagami

1775
02:11:17,159 --> 02:11:18,363
And thank you

1776
02:11:59,290 --> 02:12:01,258
One year later

1777
02:12:13,030 --> 02:12:15,891
It's the first time we baked a birthday cake for Light

1778
02:12:16,380 --> 02:12:18,026
after he graduated kindergarten

1779
02:12:19,964 --> 02:12:22,763
After he entered elementary school, I started buying it every year

1780
02:12:23,280 --> 02:12:25,229
I remembe that I blew out the candles

1781
02:12:25,282 --> 02:12:26,866
I asked him right?

1782
02:12:27,410 --> 02:12:30,200
Your brother let you do it

1783
02:12:31,157 --> 02:12:32,667
even though it was his birthday

1784
02:12:33,266 --> 02:12:35,013
He was so kind to you

1785
02:12:40,264 --> 02:12:42,185
Mom, look!
It's snowing

1786
02:12:43,877 --> 02:12:44,878
Sayu, bring an umbrella to the station for Dad

1787
02:13:05,121 --> 02:13:06,170
Dad!

1788
02:13:06,760 --> 02:13:08,465
Oh, thanks

1789
02:13:13,112 --> 02:13:14,685
Shall we share it?

1790
02:13:17,522 --> 02:13:21,158
After Kira disappeared, is the crime rate increasing?

1791
02:13:22,273 --> 02:13:24,961
Do you think the world still needs Kira?

1792
02:13:25,276 --> 02:13:26,550
No, I don't

1793
02:13:26,947 --> 02:13:28,302
Kira... killed my...

1794
02:13:36,287 --> 02:13:39,920
Light fought against Kira, until the very last moment

1795
02:13:40,933 --> 02:13:42,140
I know...

1796
02:13:43,349 --> 02:13:44,723
I know, Dad

1797
02:13:56,979 --> 02:13:58,702
Happy birthday

1798
02:14:01,278 --> 02:14:03,397
I feel like I...

1799
02:14:04,197 --> 02:14:06,217
forgot something very important

1800
02:14:09,085 --> 02:14:09,867
But...

1801
02:14:11,678 --> 02:14:14,287
I can't remember anything!

1802
02:14:22,266 --> 02:14:24,047
Light....
