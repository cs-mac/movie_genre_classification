1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,999
(Birdsong)

2
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:19,319
(Church bells)

3
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,239
Take your hands out of your pockets.

4
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,279
(Music plays from wireless)

5
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,399
(Static crackles and retuning)

6
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,559
(Sudden blast of speech)

7
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,959
Sorry about that.

8
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,239
This is London. You will now hear
a statement by the Prime Minister.

9
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,279
I am speaking to you

10
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,119
from the Cabinet Room
at 10 Downing Street.

11
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:53,119
This morning,
the British Ambassador in Berlin

12
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,519
handed the German government a final note.

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,999
Stating that, unless we heard from them
by 1 1 o'clock,

14
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,399
that they were prepared, at once,

15
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,079
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

16
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,959
a state of war would exist between us.

17
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,199
I have to tell you now,

18
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,999
that no such undertaking
has been received,

19
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,319
and that consequently

20
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,719
this country is at war with Germany.

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,559
Give them an inch, they take a yard.

22
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,479
Excuse me.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,199
Oh, um...Mr Oakley?

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,359
I thought I spotted you at the back there.

25
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,279
You've heard our choirmaster,
Walter Wingate, has been called up?

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,359
No.

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,039
Which does present us with a problem.

28
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,399
Oh.

29
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,599
I have it on good authority
that you're something of a musician yourself.

30
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,879
I used to play the organ,
if that's what you mean.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,639
Doesn't mean I know about choirs,
or would want to.

32
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,319
We all have to do our bit, you know.
It's your duty.

33
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,919
When I need you to tell me
what my duty is, Mrs Ford,

34
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,039
I'll let you know.

35
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,639
At least tell me
you'll think about it, Mr Oakley.

36
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,319
I'll think about it.

37
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,839
(Steam whistle)

38
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,479
(Barking)

39
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,519
(Train whistle)

40
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,639
Now, wait here.

41
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,759
(Knock at door)

42
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,719
Well?

43
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,919
You realise I am the Billeting Officer
for this area.

44
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,879
What's that to do with me?

45
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,439
William Beech's mother
will only let him be evacuated

46
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,959
to someone religious
or who lives near a church.

47
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,439
The Home Office says
it is obligatory to take one.

48
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,239
I'm sorry,
but he just has to go somewhere.

49
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,159
You'd best come in, then.

50
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,119
Come on.

51
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,239
Take your mac off.

52
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,239
Look...

53
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,839
if you've had enough, leave it.

54
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,119
(Slurps)

55
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,719
So, where are you from?

56
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,159
(Clears throat)

57
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,279
London.

58
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,839
Look, er... I have to go out.

59
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,719
You all right for a bit on your own?

60
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,239
- Yeah.
- Right.

61
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,359
Have a look outside, if you want.

62
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,279
(Door slams)

63
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,199
(Church bells)

64
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,679
(Bicycle bell)

65
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,999
I'm not having him. And that's that.
What do I know about kids at that age?

66
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,999
Excuse me, Mr Oakley.

67
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,559
You have got him, whether you like it or not.

68
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,199
And if you don't,
you'll have to lump it, won't you?

69
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,879
For what it's worth, I wasn't happy
about leaving the child with you.

70
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,279
But it's a case of needs must, Mr Oakley.

71
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,919
There's not a spare bedroom
going in the entire village.

72
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,039
Then try another village.

73
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,999
That is out of the question.

74
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:32,799
We all have to put our shoulders to the wheel,
Mr Oakley. Even you.

75
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,159
There is a war on, you know.

76
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,759
Mr Oakley, about the choir practice...

77
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,479
Yes, I've said I'll try and be there.

78
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,599
Hello, you're one of the London lot,
aren't you?

79
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,719
- Yes, Miss.
- A regular wild bunch, too, I've heard.

80
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,079
- What's your name, then?
- William Beech.

81
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,039
Well, William Beech,

82
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,679
I expect I'll be seeing you in my class shortly.

83
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,799
And it's not Miss, it's Mrs.

84
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,039
Mrs Hartridge, all right?

85
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,559
- Who are you billeted with?
- He lives there.

86
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,839
Oh... you mean Tom.

87
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,399
Well... Goodbye, William.

88
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,039
(Barking)

89
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,079
Get away!
Get away, or I'll kill you!

90
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,239
We'll have no talk about killing.
All right?

91
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,879
I reckon we've got enough of that already.

92
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,919
(Barking)

93
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,679
Now, as far as the dog's concerned,

94
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,679
it's my dog, that.

95
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,799
His name's Sammy.

96
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,959
And he's soft as my pocket, really.

97
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,719
So, don't you go
taking no more sticks to him.

98
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,919
Do you hear?

99
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,759
Well, now what?

100
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,359
(Sizzling)

101
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,639
(Barking)

102
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,159
Well, surely he never thought...

103
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,359
(Church clock chimes)

104
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,359
WOMAN: Dear Sir or Madam.

105
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,719
I asked if Willie could go and stay with
God-fearing people.

106
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,599
So I hope he has.

107
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,799
Like most boys, he's full of sin.

108
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,959
But he has promised to be good.

109
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:17,799
But just in case, I've put the belt in.

110
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:18,679
Good night, then.

111
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,799
Good night, Mister.

112
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,559
You can... call me Tom.

113
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,319
Good night, Mr Tom.

114
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,439
Sorry, Mister.

115
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,919
Get them wet things off.

116
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,159
And the jacket.

117
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,679
Now, here's the post office.

118
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,679
If you just get a stamp,

119
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:40,199
and post this for me,
while I have a quick word with the doctor.

120
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,919
Your mum won't be able to read that.

121
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,879
Yes, she will.
She's got one of these, too.

122
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,679
And this way,
you get twice as much on.

123
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,359
Thank you.

124
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,799
You see... when I got him up this morning,
I found he'd wet the bed.

125
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,439
A not uncommon occurrence, Tom.

126
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,479
The child has been ripped
out of his home by the roots,

127
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,559
and dumped in some alien place.

128
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,959
What am I supposed to do about it?

129
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,439
- What we all have to do these days.
- Oh?

130
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,319
The best we can
under the circumstances.

131
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,679
So, what's your name?

132
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,679
William. William Beech.

133
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,919
What's yours?
Zacharias Wrench.

134
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,119
My parents' idea of a joke, I think.
But you can call me Zack.

135
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,199
- Who've they put you with?
- Mr Tom.

136
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,079
I'm with the doctor and his wife.
My parents' friends.

137
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,559
It'll come in handy, I suppose,
if I'm ever ill.

138
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,519
- All right? Come on, then.
- See you around.

139
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,559
Yeah. Bye.

140
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,119
Good lads.

141
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,199
Have you got your Anderson up yet?

142
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,199
It's been delivered.

143
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,359
I'll send the lads round,
give you a hand.

144
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,719
- I can manage, thanks.
- Who said you couldn't?

145
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,959
You still a member of
that knitting circle at the church?

146
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,999
Of course.

147
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,119
Only, um...

148
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,679
you'll have heard I've been landed with
one of these evacuees.

149
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,679
Talk of the village.

150
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,799
I'll bet.

151
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,959
Only, the only clothes he's got
are what he's standing up in, you see.

152
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,199
You haven't got to clothe them, you know.

153
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,279
I wasn't planning to.

154
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,879
It's just that...

155
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,159
I was wondering if, between you,

156
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,399
you could rustle him up a couple of things.

157
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,239
I'll think about it.

158
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,079
What's all this?

159
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,199
My mam sent 'em for young William.

160
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,359
There's no way our George
can get into 'em any more.

161
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,479
Right, thanks.

162
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,799
- See you later, Mr Oakley.
- Will you?

163
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,439
Give you a hand with the Anderson.

164
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,679
Oh, yeah.

165
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,319
For me?

166
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,439
Well, who else?

167
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,199
Well, come on. Let's see if they fit.

168
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,479
Never mind.

169
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,239
Come on, then.

170
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,199
(Sammy whines)

171
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,519
Now, I thought
you were supposed to be helping.

172
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,599
- My new shirt'll get dirty.
- Then take it off.

173
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:54,039
Go and change it, then.

174
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,519
Aren't you roasting
in that jumper, William?

175
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,639
- No.
- He's got a temperature, hasn't he?

176
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,959
Sweating it out of himself,
if you must know.

177
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,039
Come on, chop chop!
Want this finishing by tonight.

178
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,719
I'm going over to the church for a bit.

179
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,999
- Back in about an hour, all right?
- All right.

I mean...

185
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:14,639
Have I been wasting my time
these last months, or what?

186
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,919
It's uplifting people want,
not burying!

187
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:23,039
Now, start again.
Let's put a bit of beef into it this time.

188
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,199
Some sort of problem,
is there, Mr Oakley?

189
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,519
Nothing I can't sort out.

190
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,519
If left to get on with it.

191
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,879
Right.

192
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,039
Now...

193
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,959
this time I want to hear you.

194
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,039

195
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,319
So!

William?

216
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,999
Have you no more sense
than to be out here at this time of night?

217
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:23,999
- Do you want to catch your death?
- You said we had to finish it tonight.

218
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,839
What?

219
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,759
All right, come inside, then.

220
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,079
Come on.

221
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,559

(Notes from organ)

223
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:38,319
Don't you ever touch that instrument again
without my permission.

224
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,959
Is that clear?

225
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,479
(Barking)

226
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,959
Look...

227
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,519
I'm going fishing this afternoon,
if you want to come.

228
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,919
Need any help?

229
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,839
I think I can just about manage,
thanks.

230
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,759
- Is Will about?
- Will?

231
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,439
William.
Only, I think Willie sounds silly, don't you?

232
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,159
So, is Will in?

233
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,799
We were just off out, actually.

234
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,879
Oh. Going somewhere nice?

235
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,919
Fishing.

236
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,319
Really? Can I come?

237
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,639
(Excited chatter)

238
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,879
Afternoon.

239
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,239
Zack, is your dad really an actor?

240
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,119
And my mum.

241
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,439
Course, Dad's an auxiliary farmer now.

242
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,959
(Engine roars)

243
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,799
Wow!

244
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,839
Mrs Hartridge's husband's a pilot.

245
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,079
I wish I was.

246
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,039
(Engine roars)

247
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,359
Well, cheer up.

248
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,319
It's only school you're going off to, you know,

249
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,639
not your own hanging.

250
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,119
Got everything, have you?

251
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,399
Right.

252
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,119
Off you go, then.

253
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,159
(Children playing)

254
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,999
Will!

255
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,319
I'm sorry, William.

256
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,559
It's the door just across the hall.

257
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,839
William?

258
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,959
(Thump)

259
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,159
Now, what's the matter?

260
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,919
They put me with the babies.

261
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,639
(Laughter and screaming)

262
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,079
Can we have a word?

263
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,559
Of course, Mr Oakley.

264
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,879
William tells me
you've put him in the babies' class.

265
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,919
That's right, Mr Oakley.

266
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:55,719
Would you mind telling me why,
when all his friends are in your class?

267
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,839
Because they can read and write.

268
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,399
Now, join up the dots,

269
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,719
and see what you end up with.

270
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,679
(Lead snaps)

271
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,719
Never mind.

272
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,839
Now... try again,

273
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,039
only, this time... take your time.

274
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,639
Don't try stabbing it to death.

275
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,199
There you are.

276
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,319
Have another go.

277
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,679
It's bad, isn't it?

278
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,919
No, it isn't.

279
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,599
Not bad at all.
Now, just get on with the next one.

280
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,039
That's it.

281
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:09,999
There you are, you see.
You've written your own name!

282
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,239
Oh, Mr Tom!

283
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,159
Now...

284
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,879
draw a line under that and get it copied.

285
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,359
Before you do,
just you draw me another line.

286
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,599
Them's straighter
than I can do with a ruler.

287
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,439
Wherever did you learn to do that?

288
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,399
Just did it.

289
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,279
Go on, then. Get it copied.

290
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,599
- Won't I go to hell?
- Hell?!

291
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,239
You go to hell if you copy, don't you?

292
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,599
It's cheating.

293
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,599
Whatever lunatic told you that?

294
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,279
Never mind... Just do it.

295
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,719
And if a chap with horns and
a pitchfork comes looking for you,

296
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,919
we'll blame me, all right?

297
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,839
The Tinderbox.

298
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,199
A soldier was
marching along the high road,

299
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,119
right, left... right, left.

300
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,759
And everybody used to mock him

301
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,879
and make fun of him.

302
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,159
The eldest son wanted
to go and cut wood.

303
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,159
The kingdom was...

304
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,279
cer... cer... cer-tain...

305
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,439
cer-tain-ly... very...

306
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,119
(Cock crowing)

307
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,479
What does it say, Mr Tom?

308
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,119
In loving memory...

309
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,559
of Rachel Oakley,

310
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,679
aged 27 years.

311
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,399
A dearly beloved wife.

312
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,159
Also, John Oakley,

313
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,279
aged 5 years.

314
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,119
A dear son...

315
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,239
now with God.

316
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,319
And did they just die?

317
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,959
No. They caught Scarlatina.

318
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,359
What's Scarlatina?

319
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,399
A disease.

320
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,439
A killer.

321
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,559
At least, in them days.

322
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,439
Two weeks, it was all over,

323
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,079
or so I'm told.

324
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,479
- Why didn't you catch it?
- Because I wasn't here, was I?

325
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,719
No, I was on a ship on convoy duty.

326
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,719
Fighting for king and country,
as they say.

327
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,399
No way of getting home, of course.

328
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,239
In fact, by the time I did,

329
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,439
they was already in the ground.

330
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,639
What was he like - John?

331
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,959
Oh, he was bright as a button.

332
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,519
Sharp as sixpence.

333
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,879
He was naughty sometimes, but...

334
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,919
full of life... to the brim.

335
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,399
In fact, very much like her, really.

336
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,199
Anyway, what's this?

337
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,039
Out here in your 'jamas
and not even dressed yet.

338
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,319
- I wanted to show you something.
- What?

339
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:34,319
Come on!

340
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,479
(Panting)

341
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,599
Well?

342
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,719
Dry, Mr Tom! It's dry!

343
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:46,319
(Laughs) Hey, that's great, William!

344
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,879
That's really great!

345
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,759
Somebody's birthday, is it?

346
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,319
Been steaming them open again,
have you, Matthew?

347
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,959
Any from London?

348
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,679
Never noticed any London postmarks.

349
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,799
You do surprise me.

350
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,119
- Two and six?
- This is quality stuff, Mr Oakley.

351
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,039
Well, I suppose it was only a matter of time,
once the war had started,

352
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,239
before the profiteers started
coming out the woodwork.

353
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,479
Thank you.

354
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,839
(Rumble of thunder)

355
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,279
So this is where you've been hiding yourself.

356
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,919
You do realise your tea's been on the table
for half an hour, do you?

357
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,039
Sorry, Mr Tom.

358
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,719
I should think you are!

00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:52,199
you you get to make a wish,
only, you can't tell anybody...

365
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:55,359
Just blow the damn things out, William.

367

Come on, now. Who wants some more?

368
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,919
Have the very last bun.

369
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,039
Anybody want the last rock cake?

370
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:19,319
- So, didn't she even send him a card?
- Nothing.

371
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,359
Shame on her.

372
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,199

Come on, Alice.
You know better than to ask that.

374
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,759
Rachel wouldn't have liked it
rotting away

375
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,319
just cos she's not here to play it any more.

376
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,799
You can't grieve for ever, Tom.

Good night!

00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:27,319
Oh, and er... this is for you,
as well, by the way.

393
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,239
Nearly forgot to give it to you.
Happy Birthday.

394
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,359
Thanks, Mr Tom.

395
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:52,479
This has been the best time
I've had in my whole life.

396
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,079
(Retching)

397
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,559
(Vomiting)

398
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,679
Obviously.

399
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,479
(School bell)

400
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,759
Come in.

401
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,959
Mrs Black said I were to see you,
before I went home.

402
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:29,079
That's right, William.

403
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,799
I've got a bit of news for you.

404
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,559
Mr Tom! I've been moved up
to Mrs Hartridge's class!

405
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,559
She says I can read and write
good enough now!

406
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,999
It's from your mum, William.

407
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,479
Seems she's not been very well.

408
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,479
Wants you back.

409
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,119
Whoa.

410
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,399
Where've they come from, Mr Tom?

411
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,959
A place called Dunkirk.

412
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,479
Lucky to get out alive, I heard.

413
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:58,159
Walk on.

414
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:00,239
(Hooves clop)

415
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,279
(Train whistle)

416
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,999
Now, don't forget to write.
And, er...

417
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:37,199
If you do change your mind
about them paintings of yours,

418
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:41,319
you just let me know
and I'll post them to you, all right?

419
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,599
They belong here with you.

420
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,759
Anyway, they'll still be here
when I get back, won't they?

421
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,879
Course they will.

422
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,519
I will be coming back... won't I?

423
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,479
Of course you will.

424
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,639
Now, you just take
good care of yourself, you hear?

425
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:08,119
You just... take your time.

426
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,519
You haven't seen your mother
for a few months,

427
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:15,679
so, it's bound to be a bit awkward at first.

428
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:24,319
I'll miss you.

429
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,839
You'll make sure he gets off all right.

430
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,079
Don't worry.

431
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,759
(Train whistle)

432
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,759
Here you are, then, son.
Rise and shine!

433
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,839
Willie?

434
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,279
You look different.

435
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,839
Put weight on.

436
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,399
I'll take that for you.

437
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,119
I'll say what to take and not to take.

438
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,199
So, how are you feeling now?

439
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,319
Fine... I'm fine.

440
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,519
Only, they said you was ill.

441
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,599
Did they?

442
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:21,159
So... what you got in the bag, then?

443
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,639
Just my things,
and a present for you from Mr Tom.

444
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:25,839
Mr Tom?

445
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:28,719
Mr Oakley.
The man I stays with down there.

446
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:30,239
I don't need charity, thank you!

447
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:32,239
It's just some bed socks.

448
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:35,999
Mrs Little, the doctor's wife,
sent some tonic wine.

449
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:39,639
Wine?! Haven't I told you
about the evils of drink?

450
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,519
It ain't a real drink, Mum, like in a pub.

451
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:45,679
It's got iron in it,
to help get your strength back.

452
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,359
And what would you know
about what you get in a pub?

453
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:08,039
Now, when we get home,
I want no noise from you, all right?

454
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,079
Why?

455
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,879
Cos nobody has to know
that you're here, that's why.

456
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:15,719
And when we get inside,

457
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,839
I've got a surprise for you.

458
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,999
- What's that smell?
- What smell?

459
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,839
Doesn't matter.

460
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,839
Not a dog, is it, this surprise?

461
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,879
What surprise?

462
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,799
The surprise you got for me?

463
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,599
It's over there. In the box.

464
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,639
- It's a baby!
- It's a present from Jesus.

465
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,359
Don't you dare!

466
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,759
A bit of discipline, that's all she needs.

467
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,879
She's just a baby, Mam.

468
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,279
Sit down!

469
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,879
Now!

470
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,319
My God, but isn't my life
bad enough as it is?

471
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,439
Stuck here on my own,
night after night.

472
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:45,959
Frightened out of my head half the time,
without you starting!

473
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,959
What are you frightened of, Mum?
The air raids, is it?

474
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,999
The air raids.

475
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,199
Look, if we're killed, we're killed.
And that's God's will, right?

476
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:57,679
So, what are you frightened of, then?

477
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,439
What's going on out there, of course.

478
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,479
Oh, Willie, if you knew...

479
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,919
If you only knew
what's going on out there.

480
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,039
The filth...

481
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,039
The rising tide of filth.

482
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,999
Perhaps you should see somebody, Mum.

483
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:15,999
Like who?

484
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,479
A head doctor?
That's what you think, is it?

485
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:23,199
Perhaps I'm off my head,
cos I know what's going on out there?

486
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:28,119
You just keep a civil tongue in your head,
my lad... or else.

487
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:33,439
You have brought it back, haven't you?

488
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,759
The belt.

489
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,599
I forgot.

490
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,879
Liar.

491
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,279
Liar!

492
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,319
You left it behind on purpose, didn't you?
Didn't you?

493
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:50,399
- No, Mum! Honest!
- I can get another. I know a shop that sells 'em.

494
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:52,679
Get upstairs, out of my sight!

495
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,839
(Baby cries)

496
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,879
And you can shut up, an' all!

497
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:05,599
(Crying continues)

498
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,839

(Baby grizzles)

500
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,279
Your favourite.

501
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,799
Certainly got your appetite back, anyway.

502
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,519
Must be all that fresh air, I expect.

503
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,999
Ohh.

504
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,239
Such a beautiful baby you were, though.

505
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,839
Proud as punch, I was.

506
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:41,239
Wheeling you out in your pram,
sun shining, people stopping.

507
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,319
Stopping just to look at you.

508
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:47,079
"Where'd you get him from, then, missus?
Heaven?"

509
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,639
Happiest days of my entire life, them, Willie.

510
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,399
Finished?

511
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:17,839
Mum...

512
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:19,399
What's this?

513
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,439
My present to you.

514
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,479
It was Mr Tom's idea.

515
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,319
Mr Tom?

516
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,359
I told you.
The man I stay with down there.

517
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,959
Well, go on, open it.

518
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,799
It's where I live down there.

519
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,719
Did you steal this?

520
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,359
I did it myself.

521
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,279
- Liar.
- I did, Mum. Honest I did.

522
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:52,359
And these. Where did these come from?
Did you steal these as well?

523
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,919
They were presents
from Ginnie and Carrie.

524
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,199
Girls? You've been mixing with girls?

525
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:02,159
But they're nice, Mum. They all go to church,
except Zack, of course.

526
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,439
- He's my best friend.
- Why doesn't he go to church?

527
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,679
They ain't got one there,
a synagogue, I mean.

528
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,719
Synagogue?

529
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,279
That's their church - the synagogue.

530
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:17,119
He's Jewish? You mean you've been
consorting with Jews down there?

531
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:21,759
What's wrong with Jews?
Like Zack says, Jesus was a Jew, wasn't he?

532
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,359
Blasphemer. Blasphemer!

533
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,159
You know what we do
with blasphemers in this house!

534
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,279
No, Mum, please!

535
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,599
Not that! Please, Mum! Not that!

536
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,239

♪ It's A Long Way To Tipperary

538

WIRELESS: Across the city, German raiders
leave blazing, destroyed buildings.

539
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,919
Overhead, I can hear the pulsing drone
of the circling bombers.

Below ground, in the shelters,

men, women and children listen to the sounds
of bombs and anti-aircraft fire.

Mr Oakley!

543
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:33,559
Still no news, then?

544
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:35,559
Afraid not.

545
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:46,719
Sorry, Tom.
Still nothing from London, I'm afraid.

546
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,919
What's it been? Weeks, now, eh?

547
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:55,239
A bit of bad news for Mrs Hartridge,
up at the school.

548
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,719
That young husband of hers,
the one who flies Spits...

549
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,399
Missing... Believed dead.

550
01:01:01,960 --> 01:01:03,959
Ah.

551
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,559
Contact him?

552
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,439
Only, I thought I'd have heard from him
by now, you see.

553
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,399
It's been over a month.

554
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:18,279
It tends to happen like that, you know.

555
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:21,559
Once they get back
into the home environment.

556
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:25,839
And, after all, only natural
for a boy that age, I suppose,

557
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:28,519
to prefer to be with his own.

Lost, are we, sir?

563
01:02:56,320 --> 01:02:58,199
Looks like it.

564
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:01,999
Never mind about that now.
Let's get down in the shelter. Come on.

565
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:05,039
Come on!

566
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,999
Come on, hurry up!

567
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:23,279
I'm sorry, mate.
No dogs allowed in the shelter.

568
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,959
So what am I supposed
to do with him, eh?

569
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,759
Leave him out here
to be blown to bits?

570
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,159
Oh, come on, then.

01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,439
Only, it's happening all the time.

01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,959
Kids just taking off,
coming back to London.

575

No question of that.

576
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:57,199
Look, I just want to make sure
he's all right, that's all.

577
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:59,999
And you've got an address for him round here,
have you?

578
01:04:05,560 --> 01:04:10,679
Well, tomorrow morning, God willing,
we'll try and find him, shall we?

Young couple, just married.

583
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,799
He was home on embarkation leave.

584
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:11,639
And are they both...

585
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:13,759
Oh, yeah.

586
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,999
Bloody, bloody war.

587
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,639
Well, I suppose you'll be wanting
to find this kid of yours, right?

588
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,679
- If it's not...
- Just give me ten minutes, will you?

589
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:29,039
Of course.

590
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:58,799
If it's Mrs Beech you want, she's not here.

591
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:01,999
- Do you know where she's gone?
- Gone to the coast, she said.

592
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:04,719
And what about the boy?
Did he go with her?

593
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,599
Can't remember ever seeing any boy.

594
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,159
Little lad, ten years old.

595
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,719
Oh, young Willie, you mean!

596
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:15,559
Evacuated to the country, last I heard.
Just as well.

597
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:20,279
Quiet boy, no friends.
Bullied a lot. Sitting target, really.

598
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,839
I mean, this house - a real house of mystery,
you know.

599
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:28,639
You don't half hear some funny things
sometimes.

600
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,679
What sort of things?

601
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,759
Well, whimpers sometimes.

602
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,799
Bumps.

603
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:36,039
Bumps?

604
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,359
Like somebody humping furniture about.

605
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,719
People do move furniture about.

606
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,839
At three o'clock in the morning?

607
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,599
So, when did you last see her?

608
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:50,759
About a week ago. I nearly dropped dead
when she condescended to speak to me.

609
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:52,639
Talk about la-di-da.

610
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,039
- (Sammy whines)
- There's nobody in there, Rover.

611
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:02,239
Not like him to make
a fuss over nothing, though.

612
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:05,559
Smell something, do you?

613
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,879
Look, I'll see if I can find a copper.

614
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,639
Oi! Hang on a minute!

615
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:26,359
(Sniffs) Cor! What died in here, then?

616
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:29,039
(Dog whines)

617
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,759
Quiet, Sam!

618
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:40,359
Here, let me.

619
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,959
Phooer!

620
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,239
God almighty.

621
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,879
What the hell's been going on here?

622
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,599
(Coughs)

623
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:25,599
All right, let me have the baby, son.

624
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,719
Get away!

625
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:30,039
Let me.

626
01:08:35,840 --> 01:08:38,079
What's his name, then, William?

627
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,079
It's an 'er.

628
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,199
I call her Trudie.

629
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,079
Trudie.

630
01:08:45,200 --> 01:08:47,199
That's a nice name.

631
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:54,319
Are you going to
let me have a hold, then?

632
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:37,199
Why didn't you come?

633
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:40,119
I kept calling for you,
but you didn't come.

634
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,599
(Ambulance bell)

635
01:10:14,400 --> 01:10:16,799
Are you related to this child?

636
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,559
- No.
- Then who are you?

637
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:21,959
- The one who found him.
- Just in time, I'd say.

638
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:27,479
All right, take him to Children's
and get him a tetanus.

639
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,159
What the hell is that dog doing here?

640
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,839
Sorry, you will have to
get that animal out of here.

641
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,399
I won't be far away.
Don't you worry.

642
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,919
Tom! How is he?

643
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:52,919
Any news about the mother?

644
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,439
No, but it'll be prison for her, I reckon,
when they catch up with her.

645
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:00,319
And is there a husband?

646
01:11:00,440 --> 01:11:02,439
There was once, apparently.

647
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:05,879
Died in an alley, years ago.
Choked on his own vomit.

648
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:08,759
His idea of family life was getting drunk,

649
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,639
coming home
and using her as a punch bag.

650
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:14,439
The kid, as well, I shouldn't wonder.

651
01:11:14,720 --> 01:11:17,559
So, you'll be going back home, will you?

652
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,879
Not without William, I won't.

653
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,999
(Murmurs)

654
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:39,399
Argh-h-h!

655
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,159
(Screams)

656
01:11:43,120 --> 01:11:45,039
Stop it!

657
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:52,479
Keep an eye on him, will you? Thanks.

658
01:11:56,240 --> 01:11:58,239
(Whimpering)

659
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,119
He's in deep shock, Mr Oakley.

660
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,239
We've had to keep him well sedated,
I'm afraid.

661
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,679
Well...

662
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,359
It saves combing, I suppose.

663
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,039
(Bell rings)

664
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:32,159
How are you feeling now?

665
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:35,039
I had a nightmare.

666
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:37,359
They stuck this needle in me.

667
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:40,199
Can't I come home with you, Mr Tom?

668
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:42,839
I'm afraid you have to leave now.

669
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:46,239
Don't go! Stay a bit more.

670
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,519
Now you just concentrate on
getting yourself better, all right?

671
01:12:56,040 --> 01:13:00,439
Not something I have a lot of faith in, myself -
drugging them.

672
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,639
You'll be Mr Tom, then.

673
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,599
Tom Oakley.

674
01:13:04,720 --> 01:13:07,399
My name is Stelton.
I'm a psychiatrist.

675
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:09,599
I work with a children's home.

676
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:13,639
We feel that he'd benefit
from treatment there.

677
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:15,639
What sort of treatment?

678
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,639
Psychiatric treatment.

679
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,759
I'd like him to come back home with me.

680
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:25,199
You aren't related to him, Mr Oakley.

681
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:28,599
Are there any other relatives
who'd take him in?

682
01:13:28,720 --> 01:13:30,639
That is something
we would have to go into.

683
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,639
And if there aren't?

684
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,439
As I said,
there is the children's home.

685
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:38,879
(Barks)

686
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:40,999
Good boy.

687
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:37,999
I won't be long.

688
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,999
(Whimpers)

689
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,839
(Door closes)

690
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,119
(Barks)

691
01:15:34,240 --> 01:15:36,879
(Whispers) Quiet! Quiet!

692
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,999
(Barks)

693
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:01,719
Mr Tom,

694
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,879
how did I get here?

695
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:06,319
I kidnapped you.

696
01:16:06,440 --> 01:16:08,439
Oh.

697
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:11,479
That's what I did, boy.
I kidnapped you.

698
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:18,559
I kidnapped you! (Laughs)

699
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,359
(Shouts) I kidnapped you!

700
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:31,999
They patched you up well
in hospital, William.

701
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:36,279
Just settle down.
I'll call in again tomorrow, all right?

702
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:45,999
The sores will soon heal, of course.

703
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:49,319
It's the wounds inside
we need to worry about.

704
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:53,279
You do realise that, sooner or later,
they'll come looking for him.

705
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:57,359
No... They're far too busy
to go chasing evacuees.

706
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:02,599
Besides, they didn't even know
he was in London. She saw to that.

707
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,839
- Good night, then, Tom.
- Good night, Doctor.

708
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,999
Oh, and er...you will
let young Zack know he's back.

709
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:13,519
You mean he hasn't been round yet?

710
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:18,479
No! No! No! No! No!

711
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,959
No! No! Get away!

712
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,439
Hey! Hey!

713
01:17:24,680 --> 01:17:27,279
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, now. Come on.

714
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,399
It's him, Mr Tom! It's him!

715
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,279
How are you feeling?

716
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:47,119
I want to come down.

717
01:17:47,400 --> 01:17:49,399
Yeah, all right.

718
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,679
- Aagh!
- Oh, dear.

719
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,639
That's all right.
All right, get back in.

720
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,679
There we are.

721
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,439
Don't worry... don't worry.

722
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,559
They'll get stronger.

723
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:20,839
There we are.

724
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,119
Don't you ever knock?

725
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:29,879
Sorry.
So, can I see him to day, Mr Oakley?

726
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:31,519
When he's had his breakfast.

727
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:35,519
He takes ages. You know what he's like.
He chews everything.

728
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:37,639
- I thought we all did.
- Not everybody.

729
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,479
I just take a quick bite and swallow.

730
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,519
Mr Tom?

731
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,519
Y-e-s?

732
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,639
Is that Zack down there?

733
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:49,999
Go on, then. And take that up.

734
01:18:50,880 --> 01:18:52,879
Thanks, Mr Oakley.

735
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:59,079
What's been happening
while I've been away?

736
01:18:59,200 --> 01:19:01,639
Not a lot. Been dead boring, really.

737
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:06,039
Oh, except Mrs Hartridge's husband
got shot down and killed.

738
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:08,639
At least, they never found him.
But she had the baby OK.

739
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,279
Baby?

740
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,479
- You did know she was having a baby?
- No.

741
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:15,719
You saw how big she'd got!

742
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,199
You do know about sex and stuff,
don't you?

743
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,119
Only it's something dirty
and you go to hell for it.

744
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:26,199
That's rubbish, Will.

745
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,359
Dad says sex is a man and a woman's way
of showing how much they love each other.

746
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,319
We wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for sex.

747
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:36,879
But can't a lady have a baby
on her own?

748
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:40,399
Of course not.
There has to be a man involved.

749
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,759
Right, Zack.
Home time now, I think.

750
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,519
I don't want William overdoing it.

751
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:51,639
But I can come and see him tomorrow,
Mr Oakley?

752
01:19:51,760 --> 01:19:52,879
Of course you can.

753
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:56,439
In that case,
I'll see you tomorrow, then, Will.

754
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,719
So, what was all that about, then?

755
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:07,479
Zack says a lady can't have a baby
without a man.

756
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:08,879
Oh, yeah?

757
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,679
Is that right?

758
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,599
Yeah.

759
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,999
Trudie's dead, isn't she?

760
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:19,079
I think you knew that already.

761
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,559
- And I killed her.
- You killed her?

762
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,639
I should have got out. I did try!

763
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,919
- Honest I did!
- Well, of course you did.

764
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:29,799
Only, you were tied up... Right?

765
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:32,919
Only, what you have to remember,

766
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:37,999
is the way she treated you and the baby
was because your mum was sick.

767
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,679
In fact, very sick, I'd say,

768
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,919
to do what she did.

769
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,919
The trouble was,

770
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:50,439
with this war on, people are so busy
surviving themselves to even notice.

771
01:20:50,560 --> 01:20:53,359
So there was no-one to help.

772
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:57,079
Now, you tell me something, William.

773
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,759
This nightmare you keep having.

774
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:03,399
It's always the same one, right?

775
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,399
And it's always the same man.

776
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,879
Who is he, this man?

777
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:14,479
Just this man.

778
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,159
And what does this man do in your dream?

779
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:21,159
Just keeps saying I have to go with him.

780
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:41,999
Hello! What are you doing here?

781
01:21:42,120 --> 01:21:44,239
I've come to see Mrs Hartridge.

782
01:21:44,360 --> 01:21:46,359
She's round the back.

783
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:00,759
Hello, William.

784
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:07,519
Now...

785
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,599
This is my Peggy,

786
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:14,439
who looks just like her dad,
they reckon.

787
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,879
So, how are you feeling now?

788
01:22:20,640 --> 01:22:21,719
I'm all right.

789
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:25,399
Oh, well.
At least you're back safe and sound, eh?

790
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,799
So... how about a glass of lemonade?

791
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,799
Yeah, please.

792
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,999
Then you just hold on to my Peggy, will you?
While I get it.

793
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:38,959
That's where my dad's based.

794
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:41,079
In the East End.

795
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,359
He'll be all right.

796
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:46,639
Course he will.

797
01:24:30,760 --> 01:24:34,159
I'm afraid we have some bad news for you,
William.

798
01:24:34,280 --> 01:24:37,959
- It's about your mother.
- She don't want me back again, does she?

799
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,319
She's dead, William.

800
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,079
Dead?

801
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,799
I'm afraid she drowned herself, son.

802
01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:51,519
Now, Dr Stelton's here from a children's home
in Sussex.

803
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:55,599
Lovely place, from what I'm told,
right out in the country.

804
01:24:55,720 --> 01:24:58,639
I'm sure you're going to like it there, William.

805
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:00,919
I want to stay here, with Mr Tom.

806
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:03,119
Tell them, Mr Tom!
I want to stay with you!

807
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:04,919
That's enough of that.

808
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:07,159
Mr Oakley's in trouble.

809
01:25:07,280 --> 01:25:10,879
- It's a serious offence, kidnapping.
- I weren't kidnapped, I were rescued.

810
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:13,679
Why doesn't William wait upstairs?

811
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:20,719
Go on, then. Up you go.

812
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,919
William!

813
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:45,559
The man in your dream. Is that him?
The one with the moustache?

814
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:48,319
Right.

815
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,479
This er...children's home
you're on about taking him to...

816
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,519
Oh, yes?

817
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:10,559
- You're in charge there, are you?
- That's right.

818
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:14,199
Only, he's been having these nightmares,
you see,

819
01:26:14,320 --> 01:26:16,439
ever since I got him back here.

820
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:18,319
It's not surprising. After all...

821
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:21,119
About you, apparently.

822
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:22,399
Me, Mr Oakley?

823
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:25,399
That you're going to take him away again.

824
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:29,359
In fact, he wakes up regularly,
screaming about it.

825
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,599
That bears out what I've been saying.

826
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,599
The lad needs specialist treatment.

827
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:38,919
What the lad needs is love, Dr Stelton.

828
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,319
Something he hadn't seen a lot of, apparently,
before he came to me.

829
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:47,319
Are you people really trying to tell me

830
01:26:47,440 --> 01:26:52,999
he'll get more of that where you're on about
taking him to, than here?

831
01:26:53,120 --> 01:26:56,879
Because, if you are,
you're talking a load of rubbish!

832
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,279
Mr Oakley, Dr Stelton is one of the best people
in his field.

833
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,279
And you can take it from me,

834
01:27:03,400 --> 01:27:07,799
like the rest of us, his only concern
is for the boy's own welfare.

835
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,999
Let's get a spot of fresh air,
shall we, Mr Oakley?

836
01:27:16,360 --> 01:27:18,319
(Door opens)

837
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:25,279
It isn't the boy's welfare this is all about, really,
is it, Mr Oakley?

838
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:29,439
- Isn't it?
- No, it's about you, I'd say. Your welfare.

839
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,439
Me?

840
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:36,919
A lonely, and from what I hear,
embittered old man,

841
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,999
facing a lonely and bitter old age?

842
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:43,159
You really think that's the only reason
I want him back?

843
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,919
Just to be company for me
when I'm past it?

844
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:48,559
Well, isn't it, basically?

845
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:52,679
No, it bloody well isn't!
And I resent the implication!

846
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:01,639
Doesn't it bother you at all,

847
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:04,639
that when you're 70,
he'll still be in his teens?

848
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:07,199
Of course it bothers me. I'm not stupid!

849
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,719
There's not a lot
we can do about that, is there?

850
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:15,639
Look, I know it's not an ideal situation,
anything but.

851
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,599
But... well, put it this way,

852
01:28:18,720 --> 01:28:21,279
it's got to be a damn sight more ideal

853
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:26,079
than your Dr Stelton in there turning him into
some sort of human guinea pig.

854
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:30,799
Just tell me one thing... Mr Oakley.

855
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:34,079
Why is the boy
suddenly so important to you?

856
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,119
He's an evacuee, for God's sake.

857
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:42,879
And one you took violent exception
to having foisted on you in the first place.

858
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,559
- Isn't it obvious?
- Not to me, no.

859
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:48,999
Nor to Dr Stelton.

860
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:51,679
Because I love him, of course.

861
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:54,839
As if he was
my own flesh and blood, I do.

862
01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,679
And for what it's worth,
I think he loves me, as well.

863
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,999
And is that really enough,
do you think,

864
01:29:02,120 --> 01:29:04,119
in this day and age?

865
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:07,119
It has to be,
hasn't it, Mr Greenway?

866
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:09,759
In this day and age, or any other.

867
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,479
Because if it isn't,

868
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,519
what else is there, eh?

869
01:29:17,360 --> 01:29:19,239
I won't go with them, Mr Tom!

870
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,839
I won't go with them!

871
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:24,559
- Oh, won't you?
- No, I won't!

872
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:26,759
Just as well, then, isn't it?

873
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:28,959
Cos nobody's asking you to.

874
01:29:32,120 --> 01:29:34,119
What?

875
01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:36,319
Come 'ere.

876
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,319
You see that one in the dark suit?

877
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:43,159
Yeah.

878
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,919
Well, he's from something
called The Home Office.

879
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:50,519
He reckons, after all the trouble
you've caused,

880
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,959
he don't want you back, thanks.

881
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,039
So...

882
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,719
as long as I adopt you,
all legal and proper, like,

883
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:01,479
it looks like
I'm stuck with you, don't it?

884
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,599
Oh, Mr Tom!

885
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:20,999
Mrs Little, can I see Zack?
I've got some really great news to tell him.

886
01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:23,079
Of course you can, William.

887
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:26,399
He's upstairs... packing.

888
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:27,839
Packing?

889
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:31,199
Yes. You see,
he's just had some news himself.

890
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,799
And not very good news, I'm afraid.

891
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:41,839
I got a phone call from my mum.

892
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:44,919
They bombed the docks
and my dad was there.

893
01:30:47,520 --> 01:30:50,199
I'm sure he'll be all right, of course.

894
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,519
It'd take more than a German bomb
to stop him.

895
01:30:55,120 --> 01:30:57,199
Only, I have to go and see him.

896
01:30:58,160 --> 01:31:00,159
Just in case he's...

897
01:31:02,240 --> 01:31:04,239
(Drone of bombers)

898
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:09,279
Are they going to bomb us, Mr Tom?

899
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:12,639
They're saving 'em for London,
I expect.

900
01:31:12,760 --> 01:31:14,999
(Deep drone)

901
01:31:21,200 --> 01:31:23,799
This is the BBC Home Service.

902
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:25,839
Here is the news.

903
01:31:25,960 --> 01:31:28,559
Last night's mass air raid on London

904
01:31:28,680 --> 01:31:32,039
is estimated to have been
the heaviest ofthe warso far.

905
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:37,279
At least 400 people have been killed,
and 1 ,400 seriously injured.

906
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:40,439
Fires are still burning all over the city,

907
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:44,519
and many homes in the East End
have been razed to the ground.

908
01:31:44,640 --> 01:31:46,639
The fire and the rescue...

909
01:32:14,800 --> 01:32:16,959
Still no word from Zack, then?

910
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,879
Afraid not.

911
01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:23,039
That poor child.

912
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,879
Stop pushing.

913
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,999
Come along.

914
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,839
Oh... William.

915
01:33:08,040 --> 01:33:09,999
William...

916
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,639
Has anybody any idea
where William is today?

917
01:33:32,760 --> 01:33:35,239
ALL: No, Mrs Hartridge.

918
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,479
William?

919
01:33:51,160 --> 01:33:53,159
(Cycle bell)

920
01:33:55,360 --> 01:33:57,839
Y-a-a-a-y!

921
01:34:00,440 --> 01:34:02,319
W-o-o-o!

922
01:34:02,440 --> 01:34:04,319
Y-a-a-a-y!

923
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:07,199
W-o-o-o! (LAUGHS)

924
01:34:12,960 --> 01:34:14,919
I hate you, God!

925
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:17,039
I hate you! I hate you!

926
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,439
I really hate you!

927
01:34:25,880 --> 01:34:28,199
Is William all right, Mr Oakley?

928
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,439
Well...

929
01:34:31,560 --> 01:34:35,439
He's er...still very upset,
of course, but...

930
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,879
Why?

931
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:40,279
Only that he didn't turn up at school today.

932
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,319
Or rather, he did, then...

933
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,479
(Door opens)

934
01:34:56,520 --> 01:34:58,519
Where have you been?

935
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,319
Are you all right?

936
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:03,079
Yeah.

937
01:35:04,040 --> 01:35:05,999
Up you go and wash, then.

938
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,919
- Tea'll be on the table in five minutes.
- I'm not hungry.

939
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,759
(Knock at door)

940
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,799
Can we have a word, Doctor?

941
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:26,919
Of course, Tom. Come in.

942
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:49,159
Dr Little sent it round for you.

943
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:53,079
Thought you might like
to learn to ride it.

944
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:56,399
I'm sure Zack would've wanted you
to have it.

945
01:36:07,920 --> 01:36:10,599
Now, you just come with me for a minute.

946
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:14,639
Come on!

947
01:36:19,880 --> 01:36:23,879
You think you're the only person
that ever lost anybody?

948
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:26,719
It's happening to people all over.

949
01:36:27,200 --> 01:36:29,079
This very minute.

950
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,919
And all because some maniac
wants to rule the world.

951
01:36:34,680 --> 01:36:38,239
How do you think I felt, eh,
when it happened to me?

952
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:41,039
Not just my wife I lost, you know.

953
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,839
She was my best pal, as well.

954
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:46,759
My very best.

955
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,039
And my lad.

956
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:52,159
And me not even here.

957
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,599
Except I didn't lose 'em, you see.

958
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:01,039
Not really.

959
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:04,039
Because they're still here.

960
01:37:04,920 --> 01:37:06,919
Inside here.

961
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,599
And always will be.

962
01:37:10,680 --> 01:37:12,679
Just like Zack'll be to you.

963
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:17,439
In every little thing
you'll ever remember about him.

964
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:22,799
And that is something that
nobody can ever take away from you. Nobody.

965
01:37:23,600 --> 01:37:25,599
Ever.

966
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,959
(Bell)

967
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:47,439
William! William!

968
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:52,599
- What's wrong, Mrs Hartridge?
- Nothing's wrong, William.

969
01:38:52,720 --> 01:38:55,559
It's just... Well, I had to tell somebody.

970
01:38:55,680 --> 01:39:00,159
I've just had this telegram about my David.
He isn't dead after all!

971

972
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:06,159
Isn't that wonderful, William?
Isn't that absolutely wonderful?

Yes, Mrs Hartridge.

Really wonderful.

981
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,439
W-o-o-o!
