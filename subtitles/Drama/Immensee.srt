THE WATER LILY
Lyric Suite

11
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,805
We have about an hour, right?

12
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,240
Drive ahead with the luggage and
wait for me at the gate with my ticket.

13
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,499
- When's the plane to Amsterdam
going?    - At 10:20.

14
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:53,880
Water lilies, as Mister Torsten
explicitly wished for.

15
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:59,230
We had put orchids on the table.
Something personal, I suppose.

16
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,616
- Elisabeth.
- Reinhardt.

17
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:15,585
- That was fast, Reinhardt!
- It has to be fast...

18
00:03:15,775 --> 00:03:18,380
in an hour I will be
on the plane again.

19
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,797
But we don't want to rush
at this very hour, Reinhardt.

20
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,700
When I said I'd have an appointment
with the General Music Director,

21
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,570
they made deep bows
all the way to the floor.

22
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:34,485
A little of your light is even
shining on me now, Reinhardt.

23
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,120
You've become a great man...

24
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,950
Don't embarrass me, Elisabeth.

25
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,625
It's just the time... the long time
we haven't seen each other.

26
00:03:45,115 --> 00:03:47,485
I thank you for
the water lily, Reinhardt.

27
00:03:47,881 --> 00:03:51,253
The water lily... Elisabeth...

28
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,595
When you played the
suite for me, I thought

29
00:03:55,715 --> 00:04:00,440
it is for me alone, and not
for all the strangers around.

30
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,212
And so it was.

31
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,963
...The water lily.

32
00:04:05,285 --> 00:04:08,215
What would the water lily
be without you, Elisabeth?

33
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:13,185
It is... it really is
the symbol of our youth.

34
00:04:13,608 --> 00:04:14,957
Yes...

35
00:04:15,485 --> 00:04:17,630
It was beautiful, your concert,
Reinhardt.

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,290
I haven't been out
since Erich's death.

37
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:24,085
"Since Erich's death"...
how that sounds...

38
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,855
I was on the passage
at that time...

39
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,065
when I came to Buenos I got my
father's letter... all was already over.

40
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,570
And I didn't even write to you.

41
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,490
That's how I recognize you, Reinhardt...
you haven't changed at all.

42
00:04:37,725 --> 00:04:39,670
But I have a letter for you.

43
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:42,506
Actually, I wanted to send it
to you for the concert.

44
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:45,207
But I'm happy to be able
to give it to you now.

45
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,145
To give it back, that is.

46
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,995
It was painful for me
at the time you sent it to me.

47
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:54,380
Because...

48
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,168
this is not how our parting
was meant to be.

49
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:01,580
Look... people are
connected by more things

50
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:05,392
than just that what we had
to say goodbye to then.

51
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,909
O Lord, how long ago!

52
00:05:08,089 --> 00:05:09,617
<i>To my dear Reinhardt, faithfully
Elisabeth.</i>

53
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,133
Like a thousand years.

54
00:05:12,565 --> 00:05:14,985
And suddenly, at a
fleeting hour...

55
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:18,748
in between hotel and airport,
everything comes back again.

56
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,218
As if it were today.

57
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,989
The sun is rising.

58
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,972
The sun rises...

59
00:06:11,465 --> 00:06:14,135
...over our entire life.

60
00:06:14,413 --> 00:06:16,158
Yes, Reinhardt...

61
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:27,890
I was waiting the whole time
for the bird to start singing.

62
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,562
A bullfinch!

63
00:06:29,952 --> 00:06:31,680
Until now I woke you up.

64
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,510
Early in the morning
with my whistle.

65
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,416
And when I'm gone now
he will do it for me.

66
00:06:36,645 --> 00:06:39,455
And every time he whistles,
you should think it's me.

67
00:06:39,575 --> 00:06:42,380
- What's his name?
- No name... just bullfinch!

68
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,126
- But he needs a name...
- Name him Reinhardt!

69
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:48,095
Reinhardt is your name only.

70
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:50,880
Nevermind,
we'll find something.

71
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,950
- Haven't your mother heard you?
- She's still asleep.   - Come!

72
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,565
We put the bird down here -
I have to show you something.

73
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,210
I finished it
just the other night.

74
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:11,450
- You made it yourself?
- Yes.

75
00:07:12,085 --> 00:07:14,975
What a prospective
musician is able to do!

76
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,550
You shall sit here...

77
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:18,480
...in the evening...

78
00:07:18,758 --> 00:07:21,847
- Marvelous!
- ...or in the morning if you like...

79
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,520
...and then think of me.

80
00:07:23,821 --> 00:07:26,047
If you still want to
think of me, that is.

81
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:30,160
All right, then.

82
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:32,777
...in the morning and evening.

83
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:36,440
And then we will
write each other.

84
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,380
And we'll appoint
a day and an hour...

85
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,540
...and then...

86
00:07:40,864 --> 00:07:44,496
...we'll point out a spot in
the sky, the moon, or Mars...

87
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,454
...or Venus.

88
00:07:46,574 --> 00:07:47,647
Yes...

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,425
That one suits best.

90
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:54,278
Then I will look up
from my music desk...

91
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:57,991
...and our gazes will meet
each other up there, on Venus.

92
00:07:58,327 --> 00:08:00,509
Our hearts, Reinhardt.

93
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:16,227
Look over there...

94
00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:17,580
...the sun.

95
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:22,504
I would like to be there,
where the sun now rises...

96
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,991
And when you'll be there,
where you think the sun rises...

97
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,765
it will go on the same way.

98
00:08:28,885 --> 00:08:33,190
And you'll be saying again:
"I'd like to be where the sun rises..."

99
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:36,692
That way we'll be
separated more and more.

100
00:08:36,812 --> 00:08:39,900
Do you think I could
stay here, all my life?

101
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:44,155
That's not for me.
Perhaps for Erich...

102
00:08:44,465 --> 00:08:45,884
...but not for me.

103
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:48,080
Nah, I have to get out!

104
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,975
Out into the world.

105
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:52,870
Other countries, other people,
something new all the time.

106
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,212
I don't want to hear this...

107
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:58,441
You're frightening me -
my mother would say...

108
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,625
Now what would she say?

109
00:09:03,733 --> 00:09:06,075
"That's how gypsies are,"
she'd say.

110
00:09:06,884 --> 00:09:08,783
"Gypsies"?

111
00:09:09,513 --> 00:09:11,250
What you're saying...

112
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:14,758
I don't say that.
I mean, my mother says that.

113
00:09:14,878 --> 00:09:17,576
Don't make that angry look.

114
00:09:18,951 --> 00:09:21,860
I want to come along
to where you're going.

115
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,541
Be very quiet.

116
00:09:28,721 --> 00:09:34,023
It's so beautiful to look at the
rising sun, and be quiet together.

117
00:09:42,595 --> 00:09:46,550
- You'll get cold, Elisabeth.
- Erich, you scare us.

118
00:09:46,605 --> 00:09:49,423
I didn't mean to. I just
wanted to surprise you.

119
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,180
This is Reinhardt's last free day,
you must make use of that.

120
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,790
I wanted to invite you to the
Immensee estate this afternoon.

121
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,748
- Are you coming?
- Oh.. no, we won't be able to.

122
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:00,460
I see... well.

123
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,255
Don't be upset Erich, but later,
after Reinhardt is off to the city,

124
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,803
I will have enough time
to come to Immensee.

125
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:11,418
This afternoon we'll drive past the
lake once more, with Reinhardt's dad

126
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:16,042
...towards Rehwiese, you know,
the road we always took.

127
00:10:16,162 --> 00:10:18,416
Now kids, you can tell me
whatever you like...

128
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:22,533
If one wants to enjoy a ride like
this, one shouldn't be in a car.

129
00:10:22,653 --> 00:10:25,507
Of course, a car is nice when
one needs to get somewhere fast

130
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:29,565
but over here, one should
take time, and look around.

131
00:10:29,685 --> 00:10:35,140
Mr. Torsten, being a violin maker
and Bach friend, you aren't modern.

132
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:39,065
You rather belong to the old...
I mean to the good old times.

133
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,885
Don't say that, Mrs. Uhl,
I'm quite modern already,

134
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:44,219
at least I hope so. But...

135
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:47,951
the haste, you know,
the haste doesn't suit me.

136
00:10:48,071 --> 00:10:51,466
The young people of today
have found a quite distinct,

137
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:56,051
sometimes rather formal
word for "tempo."

138
00:10:56,171 --> 00:10:58,751
I prefer the word "diligence."

139
00:10:58,871 --> 00:11:01,481
Ah father, one with
a one hundred horse power

140
00:11:01,601 --> 00:11:03,557
gets you much farther
than this carriage.

141
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:07,581
<i>Yes of course, farther,
but not closer.</i>

142
00:11:07,701 --> 00:11:10,627
You know... not close enough...

143
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:14,774
so you can have the leaves
of the trees you love

144
00:11:14,894 --> 00:11:17,776
sliding through your fingers,
when one drives by...

145
00:11:18,027 --> 00:11:22,020
Ah, Reinhardt wants to go to
China, or Honolulu, or wherever...

146
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:24,169
Hear, Reinhardt?
She doesn't agree at all.

147
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,849
But Elisabeth..
people aren't all the same!

148
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:30,832
One likes to stay in the homeland,
and the other wants to see the world!

149
00:11:31,075 --> 00:11:31,821
Exactly!

150
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,604
Leave it, dear Elisabeth,
he will soon learn otherwise.

151
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:40,506
I think Elisabeth is more like us,
a homely girl.

152
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:42,044
Isn't that true, Elisabeth?

153
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:45,119
I don't know what I am.

154
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,740
Dad, with all due respect
to your coach, but I'm quite glad

155
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:04,410
we can sit on the meadow
and have a coffee for now.

156
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,984
Where are you going?
We're already at the Rehwiese.

157
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,725
Yes, but shouldn't we
go down to the lake?

158
00:12:08,845 --> 00:12:12,605
No please, it's too humid down there.
One's not getting younger.

159
00:12:13,308 --> 00:12:16,691
Of course. Well then, let's
stay up here where it's dry.

160
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:00,984
Stop it!

161
00:13:01,592 --> 00:13:03,551
You know I don't like this.

162
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,206
There's climbing plants
underwater all over the place.

163
00:13:08,036 --> 00:13:11,285
It's creeping me out when
you're away for so long.

164
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:14,510
"Away for long"? You'll soon
have to get used to that.

165
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,144
Come, let's swim
to that drift wood.

166
00:13:23,565 --> 00:13:26,730
Actually, it isn't very nice of us

167
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,711
to swim right in front
of the Immensee estate.

168
00:13:28,831 --> 00:13:30,347
Why not?

169
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:34,123
If Erich sees us
he'll be sad.

170
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:39,050
- Don't turn the log around!
- Scaredy cat!

171
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:40,580
Ah, scaredy cat...

172
00:13:40,763 --> 00:13:43,876
I can't come to the afternoon tea
with my hair all wet.

173
00:13:43,996 --> 00:13:45,525
By the way, we have to go back.

174
00:13:45,645 --> 00:13:47,939
Just leave the old folks
amongst each other.

175
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:50,528
We're going to swim
into the wide world,

176
00:13:50,648 --> 00:13:52,788
and the first stop
will be water lily island.

177
00:13:52,908 --> 00:13:55,012
<i>No, not  to the water lilies!</i>

178
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:59,650
I don't want to. They wrap
around one's legs and cling on.

179
00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:01,140
Goodbye!

180
00:14:01,556 --> 00:14:04,175
Don't swim towards
the water lilies!

181
00:14:04,531 --> 00:14:05,910
Do you worry about me?

182
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,105
That's sweet of you. Water lilies
are your favorites, I know,

183
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,369
and today is our last day.

184
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:17,875
If you don't return immediately
I will swim back.

185
00:14:18,168 --> 00:14:22,338
I will join the others by myself.
Come back already!

186
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:25,040
Not without a water lily!

187
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:26,551
Shame on you!

188
00:14:27,552 --> 00:14:29,245
You're mean.

189
00:14:37,082 --> 00:14:40,245
What stupidity!
Stubborn rascal...

190
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,867
Dammit...

191
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:46,141
I can't... get on...

192
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:03,640
Yes... they're holding me...

193
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,250
The twines are holding me...

194
00:15:19,728 --> 00:15:23,205
I'm sorry Elisabeth, but I'm
coming without water lily.

195
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:38,635
Well, Erich,
what are you looking at?

196
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,713
Just at the Rehwiese over there.

197
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:42,480
What's there to see?

198
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,478
Not much, Dad.
Just Reinhardt and Elizabeth,

199
00:15:45,598 --> 00:15:46,863
celebrating farewell.

200
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:49,250
And you're not there?

201
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,531
Guess they don't want me there.
They want to be alone.

202
00:15:52,651 --> 00:15:55,240
You're watching them like
knight Toggenburg...

203
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:58,351
I wouldn't look out for one
who doesn't want me.

204
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:00,790
One needs to stay proud.

205
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:05,840
Won't be long till I finally
can put all this behind me...

206
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,135
...then I will be
pushing up the daisies.

207
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:11,368
- But Dad, sometimes you're...
- Well should I cry?

208
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:14,360
And then you'll be master
of the Immensee estate.

209
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:18,034
- Stay proud, Erich.
- But Dad, why talk about dying?

210
00:16:18,154 --> 00:16:21,186
- It is not the time yet.
- Unfortunately it is.

211
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,121
- I really don't want to leave this
beautiful earth.     - But Daddy...

212
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:31,088
What's the saying again?

213
00:16:31,374 --> 00:16:36,306
People are getting older,
legs are getting colder,

214
00:16:36,611 --> 00:16:43,901
after dying life is dust,
young ones can, old ones must.

215
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:52,375
I'm angry.

216
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:56,955
Don't be angry Elisabeth.
We don't have time for that today.

217
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,597
Same time tomorrow I will be
in Hamburg, at the conservatory.

218
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,716
Life begins tomorrow!

219
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:07,810
Life begins tomorrow...
without me.

220
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,448
I'll take you to the train station.

221
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,318
No Elisabeth, little girls should
still be in bed that early.

222
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,943
I can't stand farewells
at train stations.

223
00:17:16,063 --> 00:17:19,188
Where father, mother and brothers
stand there with their handkerchiefs,

224
00:17:19,308 --> 00:17:21,723
and waving and all that,
"Please write a postcard!",

225
00:17:21,843 --> 00:17:25,138
you know all that...
that's not for me.

226
00:17:26,944 --> 00:17:29,581
We'll say each other
goodbye on our own.

227
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:33,653
We will say each other
"see you again..."

228
00:17:33,773 --> 00:17:34,833
...don't we?

229
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,005
Don't cry...
you don't have to cry, Elisabeth.

230
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,854
I may, just a little bit...

231
00:17:42,974 --> 00:17:44,335
It eases it.

232
00:17:45,101 --> 00:17:47,396
Thinking that you won't
wake me up tomorrow morning

233
00:17:47,516 --> 00:17:49,427
as always, with your whistle...

234
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:53,500
As of tomorrow someone
else will do that, Elisabeth.

235
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:55,994
See, you're already awake, too.

236
00:18:56,114 --> 00:18:58,145
A bird like that doesn't
belong into the bedroom.

237
00:18:58,645 --> 00:19:00,165
His screaming
wakes up everybody.

238
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:02,587
Don't be sad Elisabeth,
nothing against that bird,

239
00:19:02,707 --> 00:19:04,902
but he has to
go down to the living room.

240
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:10,231
You don't have to hide Elisabeth,

241
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:12,255
I know what's the matter.

242
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:15,780
But believe me,
it is good he's gone.

243
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:18,296
See, one should not
commit oneself too early.

244
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,956
You don't know much
of the world and of life yet,

245
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,691
and perhaps something
better is awaiting you.

246
00:19:23,965 --> 00:19:28,452
I don't want anything better.
There's nothing better than Reinhardt.

247
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:31,969
Yes... one always
thinks that.

248
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:36,457
But believe your mother, such
a separation has its good sides.

249
00:19:36,577 --> 00:19:39,760
First wait what Reinhardt will think
of it when he's back for holidays.

250
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,100
He will come - for Christmas,
or the summer holidays...?

251
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:44,627
No...

252
00:19:44,978 --> 00:19:47,585
No? He won't come?

253
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:50,590
But yes... he will come, earlier.

254
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,037
He promised me
he will come on his birthday.

255
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:25,159
Check...

256
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:27,611
What is it?

257
00:20:28,248 --> 00:20:30,374
I see my father before me.

258
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:33,127
He didn't think sadly about dying.

259
00:20:33,377 --> 00:20:37,590
He always looked at me
so... peculiar lately.

260
00:20:38,082 --> 00:20:39,880
Did he actually like me?

261
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,358
I think so.

262
00:20:42,052 --> 00:20:46,445
He just didn't like me looking out
for you all the time, Elisabeth.

263
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:49,560
Did Reinhardt write to you?

264
00:20:52,024 --> 00:20:54,638
He wants to come
for his birthday.

265
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,276
<i>When we're apart...</i>

266
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:10,358
<i>and I live without you...</i>

267
00:21:11,042 --> 00:21:17,071
<i>just be content...</i>

268
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:24,398
<i>you are my other self.</i>

269
00:21:24,673 --> 00:21:30,823
<i>Elisabeth...</i>

270
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:40,389
<i>Go, oh winds,
and deliver this kiss...</i>

271
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:50,874
<i>to the beautiful child far away,
who has to wait for me.</i>

272
00:21:52,765 --> 00:21:57,754
<i>Elisabeth...</i>

273
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:20,686
<i>Kiss her cheeks, is what
my desire tells me...</i>

274
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:28,194
<i>deliver her my message...</i>

275
00:22:31,791 --> 00:22:39,834
<i>...I will always remain faithful.</i>

276
00:22:40,046 --> 00:22:44,361
<i>Elisabeth...</i>

277
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:09,727
You are really moving me.
You're only mistaken on the date.

278
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,445
My birthday is tomorrow.

279
00:23:11,565 --> 00:23:13,076
In two minutes it will be "tomorrow".

280
00:23:13,196 --> 00:23:15,185
Good heavens, it's already midnight?

281
00:23:15,305 --> 00:23:17,849
But you are making everyone
rebellious here with your singing.

282
00:23:17,969 --> 00:23:22,020
Don't worry Mr. Torsten. Where people
sing so beautifully no one complains.

283
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,164
And we talked to the porter before.
It was meant to be a surprise.

284
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:30,285
I thank you.
But I have nothing to offer you now.

285
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:32,627
That's what we expected. Max!

286
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:36,925
It's about time.

287
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:39,510
Heavens - don't miss out on the time!

288
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:43,218
On your birthday today...
we,  your classmates...

289
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:45,714
...congratulate you most sincerely .

290
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:47,830
How sweet you sung.

291
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,089
But tell me, where
did you get the score?

292
00:23:51,547 --> 00:23:56,225
The professor gave it to us.
He used your song as an example!

293
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:57,777
- See?
- Gosh!

294
00:23:57,897 --> 00:24:04,180
Enough serious talking. It's time to
get terribly drunk, to Elisabeth!

295
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,371
Burnt punch...

296
00:24:06,888 --> 00:24:10,400
...mixed with piquant conversations
about art and love...

297
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,973
that's what I like.

298
00:24:13,153 --> 00:24:14,892
Flames go up!

299
00:24:15,012 --> 00:24:16,358
By the way...

300
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:20,105
...who, actually, is this Elisabeth?

301
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,828
Please stop about Elisabeth.
You see, he doesn't really like it.

302
00:24:27,088 --> 00:24:28,800
Doesn't mean you have to go now.

303
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,125
I want to put at least
a bath robe on.

304
00:24:31,245 --> 00:24:34,332
Maybe you're so friendly
to let off steam in my absence.

305
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,920
Children, I know who Elisabeth is.

306
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,790
Here, "only to be
opened on birthday."

307
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,835
<i>The cute hostess wanted to give it
tomorrow, but I said today is the day.</i>

308
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,948
<i>Sender: Elisabeth, or rather
Elisabeth Uhl, Immensee.</i>

309
00:24:53,068 --> 00:24:55,860
- But Werner...   - Play a little
louder, so he won't hear us!

310
00:24:56,374 --> 00:24:57,368
Wait...

311
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,443
"Twelve Songs to Elisabeth"...?

312
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:01,966
- What?
- That's hot...

313
00:25:02,086 --> 00:25:04,449
Even twelve at once?
Cheaper by the Dozen?

314
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:08,552
"The Wooden Bench at the Lake",
"Elisabeth, a Bullfinch and I",

315
00:25:08,796 --> 00:25:10,720
"When I tried to break the Water Lily"

316
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,095
Rosie, Rosie, Rosie white,
Rosie on the water...

317
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,955
I told you this is hot stuff.

318
00:25:15,075 --> 00:25:18,246
Kids, don't lose your manners,
that's indiscreet. Put it back!

319
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:21,150
Why indiscrete?
These aren't love letters...

320
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,515
Maybe they are?

321
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,864
Why?

322
00:25:24,128 --> 00:25:27,265
- No need to become jealous, Jesta.
- Keep your hands off.

323
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:28,386
What a pity.

324
00:25:28,506 --> 00:25:29,600
Play.

325
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:38,922
<i>Should these songs, love, as they fleet,
Chance again to reach thy hand,</i>

326
00:26:02,726 --> 00:26:05,428
- Give me the album!
- Noooo!

327
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:09,490
Come 'ere...
Now it's getting hot!

328
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:12,295
But Reinhardt, take
it good-humouredly!

329
00:26:12,415 --> 00:26:14,810
Damn it, you shouldn't
bite you beast!

330
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,165
Say... is this a fight,
or a love scene?

331
00:26:19,565 --> 00:26:23,693
I think they both take it differently.
For Jesta at least it's a love scene.

332
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,975
But gentlemen, you are
embarrassing me too much.

333
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,295
Mr. Torsten...!

334
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,511
- Let go of the album!
- No!

335
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,541
Hot stuff...!

336
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:35,731
Stop being silly!
Give me the book!

337
00:26:37,719 --> 00:26:39,800
I think the fun
is getting out of hand.

338
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:41,540
I think so too.

339
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,005
- Here... better open your package.
- What?

340
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:53,820
The birthday child has
his solo party next door...

341
00:26:54,289 --> 00:26:55,835
Jesta's crying...

342
00:26:56,385 --> 00:26:58,573
...a birthday celebration
full of atmosphere.

343
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,575
But we won't let our
good mood get disturbed.

344
00:27:01,419 --> 00:27:02,678
Burnt punch...

345
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:05,281
for everyone!

346
00:27:14,024 --> 00:27:16,157
To our son

347
00:27:16,277 --> 00:27:18,418
To Reinhardt

348
00:27:28,205 --> 00:27:30,370
Dear Reinhardt!
The water lily on the cake

349
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,809
shows you that I assisted
your mother with baking.

350
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,442
Think of me when you're eating it.
Think of our day of farewell.

351
00:27:37,131 --> 00:27:40,020
It is very lonesome here without you.
Why didn't you write me?

352
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,873
The fact that we had to send you
the package shows me

353
00:27:42,993 --> 00:27:45,795
that I must not count on you
to come as you promised.

354
00:27:46,372 --> 00:27:49,098
Greetings, with all my heart
Your Elisabeth.

355
00:28:19,404 --> 00:28:22,844
It is sad, yes...
but don't be sinful,

356
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:24,975
after all it's just a bird.

357
00:28:25,782 --> 00:28:27,092
No.

358
00:28:28,251 --> 00:28:29,883
It is more.

359
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:32,127
Anyway, it has to leave.

360
00:28:32,247 --> 00:28:33,595
It's unreasonable.

361
00:28:33,715 --> 00:28:35,450
Furthermore, how's it look like -

362
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,695
we're expecting Erich -

363
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:40,968
when he comes, and you're still
standing there crying for a dead bird.

364
00:28:41,276 --> 00:28:42,635
But I'm not crying...

365
00:28:43,021 --> 00:28:46,085
Now finally go outside
and bury him.

366
00:28:46,205 --> 00:28:47,637
Or I will do it.

367
00:28:48,165 --> 00:28:49,725
I'm on my way.

368
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:27,786
Our love's little grave.

369
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,435
She was so sad about the
little bird. She'll be right back.

370
00:30:37,907 --> 00:30:41,561
But I'm happy to have you here
alone with me for a second.

371
00:30:41,681 --> 00:30:43,206
I'll just look for her.

372
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:52,563
You could do me a
big favor, Mr Jürgens.

373
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:56,805
I would love to have a picture of
Elisabeth, and you draw so fine...

374
00:30:57,798 --> 00:31:00,204
One could have her
photographed of course...

375
00:31:00,324 --> 00:31:05,760
...but a drawing is more personal -
an artistic adornment for a room.

376
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,085
But sure Mrs. Uhl,
if it gives you pleasure...

377
00:31:08,205 --> 00:31:11,955
I suggest you come over here
once or twice a week.

378
00:31:12,576 --> 00:31:17,378
I'd also appreciate if you'd become
a visiting friend to our house.

379
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,081
That child's too often on her own
in my view.

380
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:21,650
You mean,
since Reinhardt left.

381
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:25,009
Oh well you know,
it's only puppy love,

382
00:31:25,129 --> 00:31:27,029
and it's a good thing
you know about it.

383
00:31:27,149 --> 00:31:29,003
But will it be
all right for Elisabeth?

384
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:34,159
No reason to be modest.
It should be a great joy for her.

385
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:35,200
You think so?

386
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,763
Now don't hesitate
to speak out, Mr. Jürgens.

387
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:41,250
And be sure I'll be
a motherly friend to you.

388
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:45,583
There's not much to say what the
three of us - you, Elisabeth and me -

389
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:47,300
wouldn't already know.

390
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,376
I'm all by myself down there
at the Immensee estate

391
00:31:50,496 --> 00:31:52,305
since my father passed away.

392
00:31:52,699 --> 00:31:57,075
And I cannot think of any better
partner for my life than Elisabeth.

393
00:31:57,524 --> 00:31:58,547
Is that so?

394
00:31:59,325 --> 00:32:02,294
But I know Reinhardt and Elisabeth
made each other a promise.

395
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:05,018
I don't think much of it,
to be honest.

396
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:08,805
Reinhardt's surely a lovely person,
but he is too restless...

397
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:11,836
...and he certainly
won't make Elisabeth happy.

398
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:15,180
Reinhardt has no qualities to
built a marriage on.

399
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:19,109
With me she would have a quiet
happiness, on the Immensee estate.

400
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,423
And no one else in this world
can love her more than I love her.

401
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,954
There she is.

402
00:32:26,848 --> 00:32:29,514
Look, how thoughtful of Erich.

403
00:32:30,111 --> 00:32:31,055
Yes...

404
00:32:33,021 --> 00:32:35,190
I don't understand you, Mama.

405
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:36,978
Wasn't it right?

406
00:32:37,543 --> 00:32:41,845
Your mother told me you're so sad
about losing the bullfinch, and...

407
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:44,517
...so I thought it appropriate...

408
00:32:44,825 --> 00:32:48,354
That's very sweet of you Erich, but...

409
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,323
...where's the wooden cage
for my bullfinch?

410
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:04,715
- Yes, Reinhardt!
- But where is he?

411
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,075
Now where could he be, mother?

412
00:33:07,195 --> 00:33:09,350
Finish off, five o'clock, closing time.

413
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,437
- Now please...
- Wait until they have left.

414
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:16,055
My boy comes home on his birthday
and doesn't even say Hello to his mom?

415
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:20,684
Mom, now he's not just your boy
anymore. Some day that's over.

416
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:22,441
But Papa, I don't get you.

417
00:33:22,561 --> 00:33:26,325
Well it seems so... but it'd be
better for you to understand...

418
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:29,890
- Even if you don't, it is like that.
- I am apalled.

419
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:34,278
You're not apalled, you're jealous.
But that's alright, mommy.

420
00:33:34,535 --> 00:33:37,503
Just don't let our boy take notice,
it's his birthday today.

421
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:41,385
I am so happy you're back now
and that you kept your promise.

422
00:33:42,364 --> 00:33:45,450
But you aren't happy at all.
Something wrong?

423
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:48,286
I can't stand that yellow bird.

424
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:53,804
I also did like
the bullfinch more, but...

425
00:33:53,924 --> 00:33:57,187
mother likes the yellow one better.

426
00:33:57,768 --> 00:34:00,281
That's because
of the golden cage.

427
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:02,516
The Immensee estate.

428
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:12,315
It's so sad that you have to
leave again so soon.

429
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:17,880
Now Erich should come visit us
twice a week to draw me.

430
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:21,429
Mother wishes a portrait
of me so much...

431
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,439
I don't like it...

432
00:34:23,819 --> 00:34:25,693
What is it you don't like?

433
00:34:26,343 --> 00:34:30,940
That someone else gets
to know my face so... by heart.

434
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:39,792
I often complained to your
father about your unfaithfulness.

435
00:34:39,986 --> 00:34:42,385
What are you telling me now?

436
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:49,698
Your father thinks you now don't have
no more time for such... childishness.

437
00:34:52,034 --> 00:34:54,070
Why haven't you written me?

438
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:58,452
I have written you. Often...

439
00:34:58,572 --> 00:35:02,829
..but only in the way I can write.

440
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,962
But that's no letter...

441
00:35:08,371 --> 00:35:10,985
"Twelve Songs for Elisabeth"

442
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,590
"To Elisabeth"...

443
00:35:20,072 --> 00:35:24,055
"Elisabeth, a Bullfinch and I"

444
00:35:24,799 --> 00:35:26,640
Beautiful!

445
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:35,869
Now I have a birthday wish to you.

446
00:35:36,406 --> 00:35:38,744
Will you sing them tonight?

447
00:35:38,864 --> 00:35:41,977
[Dedication to Elisabeth]

448
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:54,591
<i>Should these songs, love,
as they fleet,</i>

449
00:35:54,999 --> 00:36:02,851
<i>Chance again to reach thy hand,</i>

450
00:36:03,652 --> 00:36:11,877
<i>At the piano take thy seat</i>

451
00:36:12,377 --> 00:36:21,099
<i>Where thy friend was wont to stand!</i>

452
00:36:24,231 --> 00:36:30,561
<i>Sweep with finger bold the string,</i>

453
00:36:30,681 --> 00:36:38,129
<i>Then the book one moment see:</i>

454
00:36:38,458 --> 00:36:47,678
<i>But read not! do nought but sing!</i>

455
00:36:48,128 --> 00:37:01,188
<i>And each page thine own will be!</i>

456
00:37:01,911 --> 00:37:09,959
<i>Ah, what grief the song imparts</i>

457
00:37:10,281 --> 00:37:18,600
<i>With its letters, black on white,</i>

458
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:28,992
<i>That, when breath'd by thee,
our hearts</i>

459
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:41,589
<i>Now can break and now delight!</i>

460
00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:48,210
Nice.

461
00:37:52,941 --> 00:37:55,994
This is for the singer, Elisabeth.

462
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:58,585
And who is the composer
of the the song?

463
00:37:58,705 --> 00:38:03,660
Ah father, your old organ
doesn't have the range it takes...

464
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,173
At our conservatory
it sounded much better.

465
00:38:06,293 --> 00:38:08,018
Don't be so cheeky, boy.

466
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:11,407
What was good enough for Johann
Sebastian will be good for you too.

467
00:38:11,527 --> 00:38:14,848
Don't you think so? But you made
that quite nicely! Show it to me...

468
00:38:14,968 --> 00:38:16,300
- What?
- Show me, the sheet music.

469
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,949
These are mine.

470
00:38:20,287 --> 00:38:24,385
I don't want to take them away.
I only want to take a look.

471
00:38:25,472 --> 00:38:27,970
Or should I not
see what's in it?

472
00:38:28,329 --> 00:38:29,860
Yes, but...

473
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:32,427
I see!

474
00:38:32,983 --> 00:38:34,091
Oh I see.

475
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,600
Well...

476
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:38,770
And now you think
they belong to you alone?

477
00:38:38,991 --> 00:38:40,393
Well, these are...

478
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:44,025
- These are Reinhardt's letters to...
- To you, Elisabeth?

479
00:38:44,691 --> 00:38:46,615
Yes.
And...

480
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:50,927
One doesn't want
anyone else reading it.

481
00:38:51,385 --> 00:38:53,053
I understand that.

482
00:38:53,173 --> 00:38:57,289
Now, put away
your private correspondence...

483
00:38:57,409 --> 00:38:59,172
...and come sit with me.

484
00:38:59,292 --> 00:39:02,660
Elisabeth's mom and Erich
will be there soon too.

485
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:08,272
Take your time.

486
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:15,795
How sweet of you, to want my
songs for yourself alone.

487
00:39:16,746 --> 00:39:19,285
Never shall anyone
else have them.

488
00:39:19,656 --> 00:39:21,588
They're our's alone.

489
00:39:23,716 --> 00:39:27,565
When we will be sitting at
the table with the others...

490
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:32,619
...it will feel almost as if
you're already gone again.

491
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,705
This time I will
bring you to the station.

492
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:41,362
One more time the two of
us together...

493
00:39:41,677 --> 00:39:43,222
tomorrow morning.

494
00:39:52,595 --> 00:39:54,534
I want to tell you something.

495
00:39:54,654 --> 00:39:58,849
Something important. Our very
future will depend on it, but...

496
00:39:58,969 --> 00:40:03,185
Don't stop. It strikes six o'clock
already. You will be late.

497
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:06,121
We won't see each
other for a long time.

498
00:40:06,765 --> 00:40:09,890
Will you love me as much as
you do now when I will be back?

499
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:12,693
- Sure...
- Yes?

500
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:15,935
- I defended you.
- Me?

501
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:17,682
Against whom did you need to?

502
00:40:17,802 --> 00:40:19,663
Against my mother.

503
00:40:19,783 --> 00:40:22,452
We talked about you
last night for a long time.

504
00:40:22,738 --> 00:40:25,880
- She said you've changed.
- What?

505
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,795
She thinks, not like
you were before.

506
00:40:28,915 --> 00:40:31,369
You think so too?

507
00:40:31,899 --> 00:40:33,408
No...

508
00:40:34,216 --> 00:40:36,175
Come, we have to go now.

509
00:40:36,295 --> 00:40:39,375
- There's your train!   - So what...
It will hold on for a while.

510
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:55,897
I wanted to tell you something.

511
00:40:56,133 --> 00:40:58,515
Something very important,
I mean...

512
00:40:58,635 --> 00:41:01,526
...that's important
for our whole life.

513
00:41:01,998 --> 00:41:03,825
I already know it
from your songs!

514
00:41:03,945 --> 00:41:06,961
Yes, you know it
and you should know, but...

515
00:41:07,081 --> 00:41:09,020
one has to say it as well.

516
00:41:09,907 --> 00:41:13,840
And that's what I want,
but only when I have finished.

517
00:41:14,364 --> 00:41:18,380
Only when I have advanced,
when I know where all this leads to.

518
00:41:19,138 --> 00:41:23,000
When I can face your mother
and tell her: I am somebody.

519
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:27,045
I want to take Elisabeth with me,
out there into the world.

520
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:30,513
- Ah...?
- Yes...

521
00:41:31,051 --> 00:41:35,149
See, then we won't have to part
at the station.

522
00:41:35,269 --> 00:41:37,480
Then you will come along.

523
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,310
All aboard!

524
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,845
Are you looking forward to that?

525
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:52,054
Wait, see me at the window.

526
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:16,608
Oh, I thank you, Elisabeth.

527
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:21,006
Farewell, Elisabeth.

528
00:42:21,285 --> 00:42:22,787
Farewell, Reinhardt!

529
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,520
In two years!

530
00:42:49,395 --> 00:42:53,285
[To my dear Reinhardt
faithfully, Elisabeth]

531
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,955
Three years went by...

532
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,585
Do you believe it now?

533
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,350
Come...

534
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,256
You don't have think
of the worst, Miss Uhl.

535
00:44:33,376 --> 00:44:34,949
There's not much
more to think.

536
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:39,247
Well they're artists, and somewhat
more free in how they conceive this.

537
00:44:39,512 --> 00:44:42,377
And I always wondered
why he doesn't write me.

538
00:44:42,497 --> 00:44:44,860
It won't be as bad
as it looks like.

539
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:47,768
See, yesterday they had
a shindig, as they call it...

540
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:52,166
...a large party, many people,
it got late, and so she stayed over.

541
00:44:52,510 --> 00:44:54,055
- Not nice.
- No.

542
00:44:54,388 --> 00:44:59,012
If you knew what troubles I already had
with other lodgers about this foolery.

543
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:01,052
But he won't become reasonable.

544
00:45:01,172 --> 00:45:03,046
"Philistines" is what he says then...

545
00:45:03,166 --> 00:45:04,883
...though he's such a nice person.

546
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:08,659
It's all the fault of those darned
females who all run after him.

547
00:45:08,779 --> 00:45:11,112
No wonder, he is a handsome boy.

548
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:17,773
- Is it often like this?
- What?

549
00:45:18,524 --> 00:45:21,155
Don't ask me,
I'm so bad at telling lies.

550
00:45:21,539 --> 00:45:22,698
It's alright.

551
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:27,096
Where is he now?

552
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:30,979
He is rehearsing in the conservatory.
For his final exams.

553
00:45:31,099 --> 00:45:32,002
I see...

554
00:45:33,887 --> 00:45:35,875
I want to ask you a favor.

555
00:45:37,215 --> 00:45:39,852
Don't tell Mr. Torsten that I was here.

556
00:45:39,972 --> 00:45:43,257
But... are you leaving
without seeing him?

557
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,524
Of course.

558
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,847
The board of trustees of the
conservatory grants Reinhardt Torsten

559
00:46:50,967 --> 00:46:55,930
after completing his three year studies
the predicate Master Student.

560
00:46:58,235 --> 00:47:03,200
As reward for the best composition, he
will be the first out of three laureates

561
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,532
who are also amongst us,

562
00:47:05,652 --> 00:47:08,079
in acknowledgment
of his special talents

563
00:47:08,199 --> 00:47:12,282
who will be awarded a scholarship
for the conductor's academy in Rome.

564
00:47:12,785 --> 00:47:14,355
Congratulations!

565
00:48:21,468 --> 00:48:23,880
At your age, my dear son

566
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,409
almost every year
still has its own face,

567
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:30,813
because youth doesn't
let itself be impoverished.

568
00:48:30,933 --> 00:48:33,690
Many a thing has
changed over here, too,

569
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:38,418
what will probably hurt you
if I understood you well.

570
00:48:38,538 --> 00:48:42,190
But Dad, do you have to tell him
now, after he got his scholarship?

571
00:48:42,310 --> 00:48:43,947
He needs to know.

572
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:46,981
Imagine him coming home and
learning it from someone else...

573
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:49,368
Elisabeth would've written him.

574
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,667
But Mama, how do you
think this should go?

575
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:55,717
Of course Elisabeth did not write him.
Leave it to me, I know what to do.

576
00:48:55,837 --> 00:48:58,905
Yesterday Erich and Elisabeth
had their wedding.

577
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:01,715
He asked her twice
before, to no avail...

578
00:49:01,835 --> 00:49:05,510
since he became head of the
Immensee estate after his father's died.

579
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:10,885
As much as I can imagine how much
your work must have captivated you,

580
00:49:11,005 --> 00:49:15,500
you nevertheless shouldn't have
forgotten about Elisabeth entirely.

581
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:19,940
I'm very proud of the
high award you have received...

582
00:49:20,141 --> 00:49:22,110
Your loving father.

583
00:50:06,541 --> 00:50:10,510
At the Elbe I did write my songs.

584
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:34,902
<i>Flow, oh songs
I loved so well...</i>

585
00:50:35,422 --> 00:50:40,027
<i>...into the ocean of oblivion.</i>

586
00:50:44,453 --> 00:50:49,759
<i>No enraptured youth
will ever sing you now...</i>

587
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,940
<i>...nor maiden in the time of bloom...</i>

588
00:51:00,945 --> 00:51:04,985
<i>You were the songs
that witnessed of my love...</i>

589
00:51:08,702 --> 00:51:13,050
...but now she holds my
faithfulness to scorn.

590
00:51:22,466 --> 00:51:26,890
<i>You were written on the water...</i>

591
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:36,085
<i>...now flow away
as the water flows.</i>

592
00:51:50,788 --> 00:51:52,470
How far is it to Immensee?

593
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,375
Not far, five minutes left.

594
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:56,642
Then I will take
down your suitcase.

595
00:51:56,762 --> 00:51:59,158
Does anyone have an envelope?

596
00:51:59,401 --> 00:52:00,259
Yes.

597
00:52:00,924 --> 00:52:02,512
Want a sheet too?

598
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:04,986
No!

599
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:09,213
- What's that about?
- Tcha...

600
00:52:09,635 --> 00:52:11,495
I've made up my mind...

601
00:52:11,615 --> 00:52:13,633
...I will travel on with you.

602
00:52:13,847 --> 00:52:15,045
Gentlemen, now that's hot stuff...

603
00:52:15,255 --> 00:52:18,445
Yesterday you drove us mad, we begged
you to go straight to Italy with us...

604
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,015
...and now suddenly not?

605
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:21,135
No...!

606
00:52:49,224 --> 00:52:52,251
To Mrs. Elisabeth

607
00:52:52,371 --> 00:52:54,902
...Jürgens

608
00:52:56,948 --> 00:52:59,540
Hey boy... come here.

609
00:53:03,209 --> 00:53:04,755
Here's two mark.

610
00:53:05,545 --> 00:53:09,685
Take this letter, put a stamp on it,
and put it into the mailbox.

611
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:12,043
- You can keep the change.
- Thank you!

612
00:53:32,205 --> 00:53:34,590
Thank God, we made it,
we're rolling on.

613
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,910
Sit down, leave the window
down, don't be so curious.

614
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,680
Perhaps he did got off.

615
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,995
Nonsense. Suitcase, hat,
and jacket are still here.

616
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:45,620
Perhaps he's running there,
shouting to drop him his stuff.

617
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:47,308
I wouldn't put it past him!

618
00:54:50,082 --> 00:54:53,652
Outrageous.
What buildings!

619
00:54:53,772 --> 00:54:58,028
All built with a... zeal of faith.

620
00:54:58,736 --> 00:55:01,330
- We don't have that anymore.
- Why not?

621
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,660
We have our own kind of faith, Werner.

622
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,670
You are right.

623
00:55:07,335 --> 00:55:09,402
I believe in Bach...

624
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:12,286
...Beethoven...

625
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:16,178
...in the Ninth,
in the 'Song To Joy'.

626
00:55:28,132 --> 00:55:31,193
And in that tiny bit
that God gave me.

627
00:55:48,506 --> 00:55:50,651
You sang heavenly today.

628
00:55:50,866 --> 00:55:53,955
<i>Today you sang divinely.</i>

629
00:55:54,638 --> 00:55:58,121
My dearest,
my dear blonde boy...

630
00:55:58,414 --> 00:56:01,475
<i>Why didn't you come to my
dressing room this evening?</i>

631
00:56:01,595 --> 00:56:04,173
Why didn't you come
to my dressing room?

632
00:56:04,293 --> 00:56:05,640
It was full of flowers.

633
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,355
<i>- Lots of flowers.
- Yes.</i>

634
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:12,635
<i>I love you very much. Every hour
without you seems a lost hour to me.</i>

635
00:56:12,755 --> 00:56:14,910
<i>But it's better if you
learn Italian, you know.</i>

636
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:19,305
<i>The language of my fatherland, and
above all of my heart... understand?</i>

637
00:56:19,492 --> 00:56:21,290
- Yes, yes...
- "Yes yes..."

638
00:56:21,410 --> 00:56:23,304
<i>Not understand.</i>

639
00:56:24,941 --> 00:56:27,856
I wanted to be proud for you.

640
00:56:27,976 --> 00:56:30,382
You should have with
nessed my triumph.

641
00:56:30,502 --> 00:56:32,759
- "witnessed".
- witnessed...

642
00:56:32,879 --> 00:56:36,481
And how they all love me -
much more than you do!

643
00:57:19,765 --> 00:57:21,424
Did you know it?

644
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:25,504
She really wanted it.
I didn't want to deny...

645
00:58:20,905 --> 00:58:22,994
Your song appears
entirely changed!

646
00:58:23,114 --> 00:58:26,169
It is much more Italian now.

647
00:58:26,289 --> 00:58:29,546
That's no longer you,
that's Verdi!

648
00:58:29,666 --> 00:58:34,585
That she would change it so much,
she didn't tell me anything about it.

649
00:58:36,018 --> 00:58:37,813
That's pretty steep.

650
00:58:38,095 --> 00:58:40,524
But the woman sings fabulous.

651
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:43,935
But this is not my song anymore.
This is not Elisabeth.

652
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:47,170
No... that's Loretta.

653
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:21,133
What's the matter with you?
You seem so nervous.

654
00:59:21,253 --> 00:59:25,290
Nothing so fortunate how I want
to see you, when you're with me.

655
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:27,368
Not really nervous, just...

656
00:59:27,488 --> 00:59:31,158
if you only had told me earlier
we'd have dinner together.

657
00:59:31,278 --> 00:59:32,968
Earlier?

658
00:59:33,088 --> 00:59:35,113
I wanted to surprise you.

659
00:59:35,342 --> 00:59:38,173
You succeeded in that...
It's... too bad,

660
00:59:38,681 --> 00:59:42,051
I already am meeting some
friends at a German restaurant.

661
00:59:42,171 --> 00:59:45,038
Where are you appointed?
Which restaurant?

662
00:59:45,274 --> 00:59:49,191
Well, at the German restaurant,
near the Spanish Steps...

663
00:59:55,780 --> 00:59:58,033
<i>What a joyful night.</i>

664
01:00:03,535 --> 01:00:06,460
Nicer than in a German restaurant...

665
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,479
The Italian night, the Italian sky.

666
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:27,255
<i>You are my soul.</i>

667
01:00:31,397 --> 01:00:32,715
<i>I love you.</i>

668
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:38,197
Yes...

669
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:42,480
The stars here are lower in the sky.

670
01:00:43,015 --> 01:00:45,727
One thinks one could grasp them.

671
01:00:48,827 --> 01:00:50,078
Venus...

672
01:00:51,266 --> 01:00:52,396
<i>Yes...</i>

673
01:00:53,182 --> 01:00:57,231
Venus... is so beautiful.

674
01:00:58,626 --> 01:01:00,410
So close...

675
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:09,077
It's hard to believe this is the same
Venus as the one in Germany.

676
01:01:09,484 --> 01:01:14,865
Is not the same. Is another Venus.

677
01:01:15,994 --> 01:01:19,280
Is the star of love.

678
01:01:42,771 --> 01:01:43,736
Well?

679
01:01:44,616 --> 01:01:47,085
Better put on a hood,
or don't come too close.

680
01:01:47,205 --> 01:01:49,729
The bees are angry today,
buckwheat is flowering.

681
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:52,278
The bees won't do me no harm.

682
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,074
Wherever you are is paradise, no?

683
01:01:55,939 --> 01:02:00,106
You are right. Here the lion
lays down with the lamb.

684
01:02:00,349 --> 01:02:03,768
Well, that's not what I meant.

685
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:14,075
Something is depressing
me here in my peace.

686
01:02:14,567 --> 01:02:16,598
What is it, Erich?

687
01:02:17,485 --> 01:02:21,676
Whether you... I mean... whether
you are as happy as I am?

688
01:02:21,796 --> 01:02:24,985
But Erich...
Why do you ask this?

689
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:30,430
See, loosely speaking... You are
doing the household all day long...

690
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:33,900
...then you give me that
little sisterly glance...

691
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:38,285
- Still, I often wonder...
- What do you wonder about?

692
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:43,527
Now what is it?
I want to answer you.

693
01:02:45,402 --> 01:02:49,710
Look, up on the wheel,
some bird stood there yesterday

694
01:02:49,954 --> 01:02:54,616
on one leg, and he pondered
starting to build here.

695
01:02:54,974 --> 01:02:58,106
You're a foreign bird
anyway, I thought...

696
01:02:58,226 --> 01:03:01,238
and then he reconsidered
and moved on,

697
01:03:01,552 --> 01:03:03,880
the long stilted Egyptian.

698
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:07,502
I ordered the wheel
up there myself.

699
01:03:07,622 --> 01:03:11,010
One day he will stay, if not
this year then the next one.

700
01:03:11,865 --> 01:03:14,000
Mr. Jürgens, I braced it.

701
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,814
I must go to the factory,
are you coming?

702
01:03:15,934 --> 01:03:20,242
Go without me and come back soon.
I've got hands full of work.

703
01:03:40,925 --> 01:03:43,695
I'd expected everything,
but not that...

704
01:03:43,815 --> 01:03:47,460
- Where do you come from?
- I've been here for three days.

705
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:51,191
What? And you haven't been to
Immensee yet, you unfaithful one?

706
01:03:51,311 --> 01:03:52,935
I'm on my way to you now.

707
01:03:53,251 --> 01:03:56,197
What a fortunate day,
what a joy.

708
01:03:56,402 --> 01:03:58,465
It's been more than three years, no?

709
01:03:58,880 --> 01:04:00,895
You've become a little slender.

710
01:04:01,015 --> 01:04:05,090
- Is it really you?
- Of course, it's you too!

711
01:04:05,501 --> 01:04:07,281
- It's only you who changed.
- Do I?

712
01:04:07,401 --> 01:04:09,899
You look much
more cheerful now.

713
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:11,318
Oh, I see...

714
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:12,821
...well...

715
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,554
But we will still stay
good friends, no?

716
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,450
Eh.... and Elisabeth will
be glad, for heaven's sake...

717
01:04:44,500 --> 01:04:47,310
We sold the house... Reinhardt.

718
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,451
My mother lives with us now.

719
01:04:57,430 --> 01:04:58,615
The bench...

720
01:05:05,261 --> 01:05:07,846
I think we've seen
enough photos now.

721
01:05:07,966 --> 01:05:09,303
I think so too.

722
01:05:09,423 --> 01:05:12,580
We've told enough about ourselves -
you don't tell anything about yourself!

723
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:15,020
Haven't you seen anything, in Italy?!

724
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:17,415
I could tell you a lot about Italy...

725
01:05:17,964 --> 01:05:20,839
...but we'd need
a whole evening for that.

726
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:23,900
I think we have to postpone
this for some other time.

727
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:28,165
I believe I already
stretched my visit quite a bit.

728
01:05:28,730 --> 01:05:31,374
At home they must be waiting
for me for dinner.

729
01:05:31,582 --> 01:05:33,734
But you're not about
to leave already?

730
01:05:33,854 --> 01:05:36,518
That's out of the question!
Elisabeth, say something!

731
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:38,793
We didn't even
have a toast on his visit.

732
01:05:38,913 --> 01:05:41,353
I will dish you up something
you surely haven't drunk before.

733
01:05:41,473 --> 01:05:42,655
Right, Elisabeth?

734
01:05:42,775 --> 01:05:45,830
Here, try it. That is, first you
have to take a sniff.

735
01:05:46,032 --> 01:05:49,721
Well, you world wandering soul
who nibbled at all wells, what is it?

736
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:52,760
- A liqueur...
- Yes, but which one, what brand?

737
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,233
I'm no expert... a good
old Benedictine I'd think.

738
01:05:55,353 --> 01:05:58,129
Hear this Elisabeth? Reinhardt
knows what he's talking about.

739
01:05:58,249 --> 01:05:59,751
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

740
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:01,884
Now I will tell you
what you just drank.

741
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:05,660
- A real Jürgens.    - Jürgens?
- Yes, a real Erich Jürgens.

742
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:06,831
- Another one?
- No thanks.

743
01:06:06,951 --> 01:06:10,236
Where the old barn used to be,
we're building our new liquor factory.

744
01:06:10,356 --> 01:06:12,593
We already installed
a small distillery.

745
01:06:12,713 --> 01:06:14,510
These are the first tests.

746
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,878
I tell you this good drop has a future,
we will become well-known.

747
01:06:17,998 --> 01:06:20,117
Don't think you're the only
one to become famous.

748
01:06:20,237 --> 01:06:23,187
How eloquent you are,
I haven't known you like this.

749
01:06:23,307 --> 01:06:26,980
Well, in the meantime I hit
the jackpot, but you know that.

750
01:06:27,212 --> 01:06:29,058
How long do you want
to stay at Immensee?

751
01:06:29,178 --> 01:06:31,602
My first concert contracts
start not until fall.

752
01:06:31,722 --> 01:06:33,691
Until then you
will have to bear me...

753
01:06:33,811 --> 01:06:36,830
And until then you're on vacation?
That's great.

754
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,097
No vacation... I have to work!

755
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:42,631
But for that there's no place better
than here with us!

756
01:06:42,751 --> 01:06:45,463
What nonsense to squat
down there in the crowded town.

757
01:06:45,583 --> 01:06:50,247
Move up here. We will set up the
old surveyors house in the garden,

758
01:06:50,531 --> 01:06:54,340
we'll bring down the piano, you
may compose as much as you like!

759
01:06:54,664 --> 01:06:57,005
No one will bother you.

760
01:06:58,716 --> 01:07:03,624
Very kind of you Erich, but my
parents are around as well.

761
01:07:03,858 --> 01:07:05,805
They can come up here
as often as they want.

762
01:07:05,925 --> 01:07:07,564
See, that's a great idea!

763
01:07:07,811 --> 01:07:11,635
Elisabeth, you say nothing. Now
invite him and ask him to stay with us.

764
01:07:13,855 --> 01:07:16,500
As you think, Erich...

765
01:07:18,018 --> 01:07:22,846
Reinhardt, if you want to stay
with us we would be very happy.

766
01:08:25,258 --> 01:08:29,050
Water lilies... do you remember?

767
01:08:40,361 --> 01:08:43,314
Why do you look
at the water all the time?

768
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:46,913
Look at me for once.

769
01:08:53,757 --> 01:08:58,515
Our silence is dangerous,
don't you think so too?

770
01:09:08,831 --> 01:09:12,187
These are the bells of Marien, no?

771
01:09:12,307 --> 01:09:15,335
How clear they sound today...

772
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:17,910
...your wedding bells.

773
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,319
Why did you do this?

774
01:09:27,175 --> 01:09:28,880
Don't ask.

775
01:10:15,661 --> 01:10:17,842
Why don't you knock
before coming in?

776
01:10:17,962 --> 01:10:20,424
I did, but you did not hear.

777
01:10:21,203 --> 01:10:24,450
You were so immersed in
our letters and in the picture?

778
01:10:24,794 --> 01:10:27,083
That image of course doesn't
belong in your album.

779
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:30,995
Neither does the bullfinch.
Doesn't fit in the golden cage.

780
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:33,171
To whom belongs my image now?

781
01:10:33,494 --> 01:10:35,630
- I don't know.
- Where's Erich?

782
01:10:36,762 --> 01:10:40,616
- In town.   - And we're
all on our own now, like before?

783
01:10:41,296 --> 01:10:42,590
He has courage...

784
01:10:44,188 --> 01:10:46,725
Can he be so assured, Elisabeth?

785
01:10:48,429 --> 01:10:50,274
We must not do this anymore.

786
01:10:52,302 --> 01:10:54,175
What were you looking for
in my letters?

787
01:10:55,921 --> 01:11:00,550
- I just saw how few they are.
- But what were you looking for?

788
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:03,166
Our youth.

789
01:11:03,286 --> 01:11:05,810
Not also our love?

790
01:11:07,994 --> 01:11:10,820
- Our youth.
- They are the same.

791
01:11:12,047 --> 01:11:15,050
"In faithfulness, Elisabeth"

792
01:11:17,296 --> 01:11:19,499
Did you want to give me
back the picture?

793
01:11:21,158 --> 01:11:22,309
No.

794
01:11:24,047 --> 01:11:27,050
Over our heads, in the
woodwork of the new building

795
01:11:27,170 --> 01:11:30,525
today the ribbons are crowning
the topping-out ceremony.

796
01:11:30,645 --> 01:11:34,615
And we, who erected these walls...

797
01:11:34,735 --> 01:11:40,295
want today - revered constructor
and revered constructoresse...

798
01:11:40,415 --> 01:11:44,008
...following an old tradition,
recite the topping out speech.

799
01:11:44,045 --> 01:11:45,591
Let me put this down.

800
01:11:46,292 --> 01:11:49,811
Just as it's standing here
now in miniature,

801
01:11:49,931 --> 01:11:53,558
it will once stand there
large and completed -

802
01:11:53,930 --> 01:11:55,390
You may sit down again.

803
01:11:55,726 --> 01:12:00,415
...and it will tower high over the
Immensee as a sign of diligence...

804
01:12:00,535 --> 01:12:04,710
...and development, by giving
to the holy fruits of your fields...

805
01:12:04,830 --> 01:12:08,170
...a new purpose -
I mean the potatoes.

806
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:14,374
You acknowledged the spirituality
of this fruit! Spirit!

807
01:12:14,494 --> 01:12:16,704
And it's spirit that counts!

808
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:19,595
And once we get
the machines in here...

809
01:12:19,715 --> 01:12:23,962
...then it's not only a matter of
squeezing the spirit out of the potato...

810
01:12:24,082 --> 01:12:31,237
...no - it will be your duty to carry
out the fruits of our labor...

811
01:12:31,357 --> 01:12:35,681
... in barrels and bottles,
as the machines' real engine.

812
01:12:35,801 --> 01:12:39,290
And, and, very important,
if I may say so...

813
01:12:39,410 --> 01:12:43,018
in refined condition
in the form of brandy!

814
01:12:43,138 --> 01:12:44,396
Bravo!

815
01:12:44,516 --> 01:12:48,828
Also as an engine
for happy people in happy hours!

816
01:12:48,948 --> 01:12:50,459
Bravo!

817
01:13:22,386 --> 01:13:26,725
What do you say about Elisabeth?
I haven't seen her so lively before.

818
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:45,120
Don't you dance, Erich?
No. I can't dance.

819
01:13:45,753 --> 01:13:47,984
I never danced in my life.

820
01:13:56,536 --> 01:13:59,404
Anything wrong, Erich?

821
01:13:59,695 --> 01:14:01,642
What? ... Why?

822
01:14:02,458 --> 01:14:03,301
No.

823
01:14:12,212 --> 01:14:14,336
I know what I'm doing, Mama.

824
01:14:15,373 --> 01:14:17,018
What are you doing?

825
01:14:31,225 --> 01:14:35,183
See, so lively,
I never can be like that.

826
01:14:36,592 --> 01:14:40,640
Reinhardt is an artist.
He can express his joy very well.

827
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:42,725
And Elisabeth...

828
01:14:45,968 --> 01:14:48,235
...it seems to suit her well.

829
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:51,188
So why did you invite him?

830
01:14:52,563 --> 01:14:55,939
- Am I not allowed to?
- Sure, of course.

831
01:14:56,990 --> 01:14:59,035
- Of course...
- See, Mama...

832
01:14:59,755 --> 01:15:01,367
I also think so.

833
01:15:10,807 --> 01:15:14,792
Elisabeth is more beautiful
when she is happy like that.

834
01:15:16,115 --> 01:15:19,833
All people are more beautiful
when they're happy...!

835
01:15:26,999 --> 01:15:28,730
I'm getting dizzy.

836
01:15:36,843 --> 01:15:40,256
Too much turmoil for me here,
I have to prepare some things...

837
01:15:40,376 --> 01:15:42,405
...if we want to go
over there afterwards...

838
01:15:42,515 --> 01:15:43,902
That's alright mama.

839
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,104
You're running away
from me Elisabeth?

840
01:16:03,224 --> 01:16:06,980
I got too warm from dancing.
I'm afraid of getting a cold.

841
01:16:07,945 --> 01:16:10,636
But it's so warm, Elisabeth.

842
01:16:10,756 --> 01:16:13,080
Yes... that's why.

843
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,905
Now, what are you then?
Warm or cold?

844
01:16:16,627 --> 01:16:20,100
- I don't know.   - I think
you don't know lots of things.

845
01:16:20,645 --> 01:16:24,087
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Why do you want to go home suddenly?

846
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:27,910
The others already went ahead.
They'll be waiting!

847
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,041
Let them wait - doesn't matter!

848
01:16:30,735 --> 01:16:34,185
Are you afraid of...
being alone with me?

849
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:40,335
- You should know if I should be
afraid!    - Oh yes... I do know that.

850
01:16:41,135 --> 01:16:45,770
When I just held you in my arms while
dancing, it all was just like then.

851
01:16:46,192 --> 01:16:49,500
- You must not think of that.
- I have to think of it!

852
01:16:49,620 --> 01:16:51,880
- Let me go  - You think of it too!
- No!

853
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:55,970
Yes you do. You had wished
for this dance to never end.

854
01:16:56,090 --> 01:16:57,880
It must have an end, Reinhardt.

855
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,084
- Why, Elisabeth?
- Oh, Reinhardt.

856
01:17:02,128 --> 01:17:05,834
Elisabeth, if I would ask you...

857
01:17:06,149 --> 01:17:08,605
Elisabeth, do you
want to come with me?

858
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:11,910
Out into the world,
just as you once promised me.

859
01:17:12,149 --> 01:17:15,634
I have a right to ask you this.

860
01:17:15,754 --> 01:17:18,701
What would your answer be?

861
01:17:20,190 --> 01:17:21,949
Mother is calling!

862
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:34,530
Is this how you wanted it?

863
01:17:36,125 --> 01:17:39,048
He always stood between us.

864
01:17:40,178 --> 01:17:42,659
Even when he wasn't here.

865
01:17:44,105 --> 01:17:45,385
Isn't it so?

866
01:17:47,895 --> 01:17:48,682
See...

867
01:17:50,965 --> 01:17:53,920
One cannot enforce
one's own happiness.

868
01:17:55,164 --> 01:17:58,985
But it's not about my happiness...
it's all about yours.

869
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:06,624
In the last few days I've seen lights
shining in your eyes for the first time.

870
01:18:08,160 --> 01:18:09,810
Because of Reinhardt.

871
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,518
I let you go, Elisabeth.

872
01:18:19,185 --> 01:18:21,296
You can do that?

873
01:18:23,807 --> 01:18:26,488
You can really do that?

874
01:18:30,826 --> 01:18:32,972
Because I love you...

875
01:18:34,473 --> 01:18:36,762
...I want your happiness.

876
01:19:15,451 --> 01:19:17,204
Watching the bees?

877
01:19:17,482 --> 01:19:22,132
Yes... I enjoy it, seeing how...

878
01:19:22,252 --> 01:19:27,069
<i>...they come and go... the hive-bees
of Immensee. [ lit. Bees' Lake ]</i>

879
01:19:27,189 --> 01:19:29,490
There on the lime tree,
there's an entire swarm.

880
01:19:29,610 --> 01:19:32,910
Yes it is time to swarm.
High time of  the bees...

881
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:35,584
Now the struggle
for the queen begins.

882
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:40,011
The one who flies highest with her,
the strongest, will conquer her.

883
01:19:40,333 --> 01:19:44,860
To be free for the strongest, that's
the right of the hive-bee queen.

884
01:19:45,236 --> 01:19:46,158
See?

885
01:19:47,675 --> 01:19:49,334
Nature is just!

886
01:19:50,342 --> 01:19:53,152
Can't you be clear about
what you want to say?

887
01:19:53,985 --> 01:19:55,775
Not anymore.

888
01:19:56,933 --> 01:19:59,129
I am not allowed anymore.

889
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:11,878
- Why didn't you take the yellow coach?
- Madam prefers the black one.

890
01:20:14,748 --> 01:20:16,350
I'm going to town alone.

891
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:19,091
Shouldn't I ask Madam if
there's anything to do?    - No!

892
01:20:19,211 --> 01:20:21,644
...whether there's anything to get
from the butcher or the grocer?

893
01:20:21,764 --> 01:20:24,240
Nevermind, I'll do it myself.
You can stay here.

894
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:27,062
I'll be back home
in the evening.

895
01:20:28,385 --> 01:20:30,061
<i>I am free.</i>

896
01:20:30,759 --> 01:20:34,149
Erich let me go, last night.

897
01:20:34,799 --> 01:20:36,266
Forever.

898
01:20:40,929 --> 01:20:43,088
Do you know what you just said?

899
01:20:44,547 --> 01:20:45,956
Oh yes...

900
01:20:47,654 --> 01:20:50,595
<i>Then... you are my Elisabeth?</i>

901
01:20:53,232 --> 01:20:54,648
No.

902
01:20:56,007 --> 01:20:58,469
<i>He is the stronger one.</i>

903
01:20:59,263 --> 01:21:00,857
Now I know.

904
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,840
You want to sacrifice yourself?

905
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:11,916
Your happiness? Your life?

906
01:21:12,646 --> 01:21:13,890
Me?

907
01:21:14,934 --> 01:21:16,666
Your love?

908
01:21:34,324 --> 01:21:37,879
<i>- But it's not about Jesta.
- But apparently it was...</i>

909
01:21:38,336 --> 01:21:41,297
...at least for you.
Never for me.

910
01:21:41,941 --> 01:21:44,070
- Never?
- Never!

911
01:21:47,056 --> 01:21:48,043
I see...

912
01:21:48,415 --> 01:21:51,807
If I had known that
at that time, then...

913
01:21:51,927 --> 01:21:53,292
What then?

914
01:21:57,327 --> 01:22:00,284
What would have been
if you had known it back then?

915
01:22:00,869 --> 01:22:01,877
Then...

916
01:22:02,799 --> 01:22:07,400
it would have made me
very ... happy, back then.

917
01:22:09,452 --> 01:22:13,587
But Reinhardt, do you think
that in these circles,

918
01:22:13,707 --> 01:22:18,390
among these people, in this kind of
freedom, I could have been living?

919
01:22:18,912 --> 01:22:22,052
I don't want to rise above them,
it all may be very nice, but...

920
01:22:22,172 --> 01:22:24,220
that's not my world!

921
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:29,445
Do you think I could have lived up
to what you experienced in Italy?

922
01:22:30,882 --> 01:22:34,310
See? I am right, isn't it?

923
01:22:38,870 --> 01:22:41,919
I was on my way home, back then...

924
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:45,351
...I was on the train coming
from Hamburg...

925
01:22:45,664 --> 01:22:50,221
I was so embarrassed when people
looked at me me because I was crying.

926
01:22:51,230 --> 01:22:54,225
I was saying farewell
to you, Reinhardt.

927
01:22:55,520 --> 01:23:00,952
I was saying goodbye
to what was dearest to me.

928
01:23:02,475 --> 01:23:06,838
See, I realized in everything
that we don't belong together...

929
01:23:06,958 --> 01:23:10,375
that our roads through life
don't match.

930
01:23:10,495 --> 01:23:15,400
See, you belong out into the world.
You have to be in Hamburg today...

931
01:23:15,520 --> 01:23:18,804
...and in Rome tomorrow, and
after that in Athens, or wherever...

932
01:23:18,924 --> 01:23:20,000
...and I...

933
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:21,435
And you?

934
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:26,731
I became... rooted... here.

935
01:23:29,345 --> 01:23:32,794
Rooted... here...
I see.

936
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,585
And now?

937
01:23:37,485 --> 01:23:38,350
Yes...

938
01:23:38,668 --> 01:23:41,430
Now I love Erich.

939
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:45,355
When he let me go yesterday,

940
01:23:45,475 --> 01:23:49,224
letting me go because
he loves me, for you...

941
01:23:49,546 --> 01:23:53,049
I knew that I belong to him,

942
01:23:53,169 --> 01:23:56,024
indissoluble, forever.

943
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:59,755
And that's why we
have to say farewell.

944
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,804
I'm not sleeping, Elisabeth.

945
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,060
Forgive me.

946
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:01,130
I love you, Erich.

947
01:25:03,345 --> 01:25:04,997
Do you believe me?

948
01:25:05,906 --> 01:25:08,280
I believe everything you say.

949
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:13,621
But you're crying.

950
01:25:15,108 --> 01:25:18,960
Even happiness has its tears.

951
01:25:40,205 --> 01:25:44,021
"To my dear Reinhardt -
faithfully, Elisabeth"

952
01:25:47,508 --> 01:25:52,935
No, it is not appropriate
to take the picture back.

953
01:25:54,070 --> 01:25:55,779
But yes, Reinhardt.

954
01:25:57,567 --> 01:26:00,220
We were faithful, both of us...

955
01:26:00,577 --> 01:26:04,099
...you to your work, to the
star that was guiding you...

956
01:26:04,219 --> 01:26:07,410
...to the whole world
you belong to.

957
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:12,613
And I... to my small world,

958
01:26:12,733 --> 01:26:15,545
where I became rooted in...

959
01:26:16,145 --> 01:26:20,279
...and to my duties that I accepted
since Erich passed away...

960
01:26:20,722 --> 01:26:25,336
...to conserve and expand what
he started to build at Immensee.

961
01:26:28,340 --> 01:26:31,960
So let us remain
faithful, both of us,

962
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:34,930
even if we don't hear from
each other for years...

963
01:26:35,070 --> 01:26:39,718
...and when the oceans and
continents separate us.

964
01:26:39,965 --> 01:26:45,775
Faithful to our youth,
faithful to ourselves.

965
01:27:35,524 --> 01:27:42,569
<i>I will always remain faithful...</i>

966
01:27:43,819 --> 01:27:47,738
<i>Elisabeth...</i>

967
01:27:52,718 --> 01:27:55,007
End
