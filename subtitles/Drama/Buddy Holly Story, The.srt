Episode 23

5
00:02:57,904 --> 00:03:00,812
Didn't you say that it is an occassion worth congratulating?

6
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,311
The person that said that it is worth congratulating to even be nominated..

7
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:08,405
sure doesn't look like he's having fun.

8
00:03:08,505 --> 00:03:09,937
Really?

9
00:03:10,079 --> 00:03:11,818
I'm sorry.

10
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:15,255
I guess I'm not the partying type.

11
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:24,452
Are you sure you are really sick?

12
00:03:24,452 --> 00:03:26,888
I need to eat to get stronger!

13
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:29,189
I cannot really taste the food...

14
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,086
but I need to eat to get better

15
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,467
But still, shouldn't you have gone to the awards?

16
00:03:34,467 --> 00:03:37,239
You should go to those award ceremonies.

17
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:39,700
Wearing a dress, and taking pictures, how great that would be.

18
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,688
I also thought about it but...

19
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:46,750
but if I went like this and get no awards... and get even more sick...

20
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,122
it's embarassing.

21
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:52,316
Let us now begin the

22
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:54,584
2010 KLPGA

23
00:03:54,584 --> 00:03:58,003
Awards Ceremony.

24
00:03:59,855 --> 00:04:07,207
First we will announce the rookie award to the player that stood out from all the other rookies.

25
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:12,169
This year the nominees for rookie of the year are Min Hae Ryung and Sung Mi Soo.

26
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,048
I believe they're both nervous seeing it's an award you can only receive once in your life.

27
00:04:15,048 --> 00:04:17,270
I believe they're both nervous seeing it's an award you can only recieve once in your life.

28
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:21,919
Then let's see who the winner is...

29
00:04:22,077 --> 00:04:24,241
This year's rookie of the year goes to...

30
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:28,346
Sung Mi Soo!

31
00:04:28,346 --> 00:04:30,186
Congratulations!

32
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:43,654
Due to personal obligations, Sung Mi Soo wasn't able to attend.

33
00:04:43,654 --> 00:04:47,572
Therefore her coach, John Lee, will be accepting the award on her behalf.

34
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,737
Please give a round of applause.

35
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:02,897
Rewards and trophy, also flower is being given.

36
00:05:02,897 --> 00:05:05,805
Once again, please give him a big round of applause.

37
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,848
Yes, thank you very much.

38
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:14,770
Sung Mi Soo even prepared a dress for this day

39
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,321
because of her bad cold, she couldn't attend today's ceremony.

40
00:05:19,267 --> 00:05:23,972
Personally, rather than the fact that she herself couldn't get this award

41
00:05:23,972 --> 00:05:27,548
but the fact that we couldn't see her in a dress

42
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:30,116
makes me really sad.

43
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,292
I think she would really like this.

44
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:36,071
I will make sure she gets this safely. Thank you.

45
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,618
Yes, thank you very much.

46
00:05:37,618 --> 00:05:40,635
Please give him a round of applause.

47
00:05:44,965 --> 00:05:47,020
Should I call Gong Sook and Jun Gi

48
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,039
for some beer?

49
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,472
Oh, I'm freaking bored!

50
00:06:03,066 --> 00:06:05,248
What do I do?

51
00:06:10,289 --> 00:06:12,168
Yes..?

52
00:06:13,679 --> 00:06:15,312
I'm okay

53
00:06:15,629 --> 00:06:18,237
If I rest a bit, i'll get better

54
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,922
You want me to make you get well right away?

55
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,640
Pardon?

56
00:06:22,804 --> 00:06:26,232
The rookie award.

57
00:06:26,232 --> 00:06:28,098
They say that you got it.

58
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:29,977
Sung mi...

59
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,553
Sung mi soo...

60
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,166
Me?!

61
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,467
See?

62
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,148
I told you you would feel better right away.

63
00:06:40,458 --> 00:06:44,652
I got it for you. We should have a conveying ceremony.

64
00:06:44,752 --> 00:06:46,349
You owe me a meal!

65
00:06:46,349 --> 00:06:48,111
Sure!

66
00:06:53,229 --> 00:06:55,919
Let's look at the news.

67
00:06:56,186 --> 00:06:57,654
Just look at the midnight news.

68
00:06:57,654 --> 00:07:01,140
Did you buy TV to watch drama?

69
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,146
Mom!

70
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:03,741
Yes, why?

71
00:07:03,741 --> 00:07:05,536
Dad!

72
00:07:06,463 --> 00:07:12,235
I... got the Rookie Awards!!

73
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,971
Wh..wha...Mi Soo!!

74
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,075
That's great!

75
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:21,713
So we should have gone no matter what!

76
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:23,732
You got the award?

77
00:07:23,732 --> 00:07:25,916
Of course!! Who am I?

78
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:37,561
You were in LA?

79
00:07:37,561 --> 00:07:41,146
This is a very famous place for sports agency!

80
00:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,799
I am in the golf department.

81
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:47,137
I go around all the games around the world to look for a great player.

82
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:51,808
I came in to take a look at Korean players... but all the games seems to be over by now.

83
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:54,378
There are a lot of good players in LPGA.

84
00:07:54,378 --> 00:07:56,246
I'm looking for new players.

85
00:07:56,246 --> 00:08:00,951
All the good players are already in a long term contract, so I can't do anything.

86
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:04,204
I see...

87
00:08:04,621 --> 00:08:07,958
Oh, I can take YOU with me!

88
00:08:08,425 --> 00:08:11,394
I don't know if you can pay that much...

89
00:08:11,728 --> 00:08:13,564
You now even make a joke!

90
00:08:13,564 --> 00:08:15,966
Are you the old Min Hae Ryung?

91
00:08:15,966 --> 00:08:18,535
You changed a lot.

92
00:08:18,869 --> 00:08:20,938
Let's have a meal together before I go in.

93
00:08:20,938 --> 00:08:22,272
Call me!

94
00:08:25,976 --> 00:08:27,344
Where were you?

95
00:08:27,344 --> 00:08:29,746
I just gave a call to Mi Soo.

96
00:08:31,615 --> 00:08:34,351
I am tired... let's just go home.

97
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,228
You look happy.

98
00:08:45,228 --> 00:08:47,097
Really?

99
00:08:47,598 --> 00:08:52,102
Of course you are happy since your player who went through a lot just got the award.

100
00:08:52,248 --> 00:08:55,238
You don't have to read me.

101
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,240
Are you okay?

102
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,476
I feel a little bit...unsatisfied...

103
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:03,647
Probably its because of the intentional putting miss on the Il Rose game.

104
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:08,151
It would have been hard for them to just ignore that.

105
00:09:08,652 --> 00:09:11,054
Right...

106
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,124
Should I rather be thankful?

107
00:09:14,124 --> 00:09:16,560
for making a player like me a nominee ..

108
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,462
I will give you your own rookie award.

109
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:23,265
You can count on it.

110
00:09:23,265 --> 00:09:25,001
Really?

111
00:09:26,474 --> 00:09:28,438
Really.

112
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:45,889
Change it into something into high class even if that means a lot of money.

113
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,092
Just changing some of this and that wouldn't do anything.

114
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,928
We will make a draft and give it to you.

115
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:52,362
Okay.

116
00:09:58,535 --> 00:10:00,837
You seem to be in a good mood.

117
00:10:01,327 --> 00:10:03,740
Not good... not bad...

118
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,208
I guess the weather is just okay.

119
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,511
I thought you would be all down...

120
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:10,113
It feels good to see you smiling.

121
00:10:10,669 --> 00:10:12,415
Thank you.

122
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,253
Do you have an appointment tonight?

123
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,457
John seemed to be making reservations for tonight at the restaurant.

124
00:10:20,457 --> 00:10:24,861
Stop hanging around with just the two of you but invite your old mom once in a while.

125
00:10:28,699 --> 00:10:31,535
I will give you your own rookie awards.

126
00:10:31,535 --> 00:10:33,336
You can count on it.

127
00:10:38,976 --> 00:10:43,313
It will all get off in a day... no need for all this...

128
00:10:47,256 --> 00:10:50,921
I also made a food in the kitchen with you.  Well that was because you asked me to help you.

129
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:55,058
I can't even cook since I'm afraid the nails will get dirty...

130
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:58,161
Then just take care of your hands.

131
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,200
Come once in a while.

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,561
Your hand is very rough.

133
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:08,171
It is, right?

134
00:11:08,705 --> 00:11:10,941
That hand is not just a hand.

135
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:15,579
It's the hand that made the rookie of the golf industry, Sung Mi Soo.

136
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,782
Oh, are you Sung Mi Soo's mother?

137
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,251
Wow...

138
00:11:21,251 --> 00:11:25,923
Then we are taking care of Min Hae Ryung and Sung Mi Soo's mothers!!

139
00:11:25,923 --> 00:11:27,991
Come often!

140
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,626
Yes...

141
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,696
You two seem close.

142
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,498
We are friends.

143
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,667
I see.

144
00:11:41,905 --> 00:11:44,507
Sung Mi Soo likes it, right?

145
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:49,145
The rookie awards? Yes of course.

146
00:11:49,245 --> 00:11:52,516
It would have been better if both of them could get it...

147
00:11:52,516 --> 00:11:55,052
Why aren't there any double prize winners.

148
00:11:55,052 --> 00:11:57,621
How can two people get rookie awards.

149
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:02,058
My Hae Ryung can get the Best Player of the Year award next year.

150
00:12:04,595 --> 00:12:06,129
Yes...

151
00:12:11,678 --> 00:12:28,385
<i>Subtitles brought to you by Birdy Buddy Team @ viki.com</i>

152
00:12:28,385 --> 00:12:29,953
Should we give a toast?

153
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:34,958
To congratulate Sung Mi Soo's winning of the Rookie Prize.

154
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:35,825
Cheers!

155
00:12:35,825 --> 00:12:37,093
Cheers!

156
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,176
Oh, what's up Hae Ryung?

157
00:13:12,062 --> 00:13:14,613
What are you doing right now?

158
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:16,132
I'm...

159
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:18,468
Eating dinner with Mi Soo

160
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:20,403
Also to give her her trophy.

161
00:13:20,403 --> 00:13:22,090
Did you eat yet?

162
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,840
Of course I ate already.

163
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,875
look at what time it is

164
00:13:26,876 --> 00:13:28,345
Enjoy your meal

165
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:31,414
Give Mi Soo my congratulations

166
00:14:03,513 --> 00:14:06,016
I wanted to see some Korean players.

167
00:14:06,016 --> 00:14:08,018
But all the games seems to be over.

168
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:10,820
There are a lot of good players in LPGA.

169
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:12,555
I'm looking for new players.

170
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:16,626
All the good players are already in a long term contract, so I can't do anything.

171
00:14:23,566 --> 00:14:26,636
Do you still sleep with your 8 iron?

172
00:14:28,672 --> 00:14:30,674
I just did that that time!

173
00:14:30,674 --> 00:14:33,343
It looked very natural to me!

174
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:36,513
Now you will hold onto that trophy when you sleep...right?

175
00:14:37,113 --> 00:14:38,314
You are jealous.

176
00:14:38,314 --> 00:14:39,649
What?

177
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:42,752
I also got a present to give you!

178
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,587
I should just return it.

179
00:14:44,587 --> 00:14:46,456
Why return it!

180
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,514
It was just a joke...

181
00:15:09,505 --> 00:15:11,181
Wow!

182
00:15:14,651 --> 00:15:16,853
It's pretty

183
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,090
Do you like it?

184
00:15:26,629 --> 00:15:28,331
It's ok, it's ok

185
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,970
Compared to that guy, I'm not that great but...

186
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,705
but still..

187
00:15:35,705 --> 00:15:38,208
I still don't understand why you won't accept me

188
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:41,084
That's your problem

189
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:44,414
You start of by saying that you are worse off than others.

190
00:15:44,414 --> 00:15:45,715
The guy Gong Sook met

191
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:48,190
how do you know that he is a good guy or a bad guy?

192
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:50,887
He might have a good job or a good family background.

193
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:54,391
You were mad that I messed up her set up date...

194
00:15:54,391 --> 00:15:55,759
You know that!

195
00:15:56,626 --> 00:15:58,094
and pork is all you give me?

196
00:15:58,094 --> 00:16:00,171
You should have at least ordered korean beef!

197
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:01,131
Should I order korean beef?

198
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,332
Aigoo..

199
00:16:02,332 --> 00:16:05,953
How can I communicate with you..

200
00:16:19,885 --> 00:16:20,717
You...

201
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:24,320
do you want to marry Gong Sook?

202
00:16:24,788 --> 00:16:26,289
Yes.

203
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:27,624
If you allow me too

204
00:16:32,238 --> 00:16:33,263
Gong Sook...

205
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:35,498
Can you keep her happy?

206
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,479
She...

207
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:53,902
I can't promise that I will make her live like a princess.

208
00:16:53,902 --> 00:16:57,687
I can't lie that she won't ever have to wash the dishes.

209
00:16:57,687 --> 00:16:59,089
But,

210
00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:02,124
I will not make her cry because we have no money to feed on.

211
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:05,228
I won't make her cry because I am sick.

212
00:17:05,228 --> 00:17:07,184
I won't make her cry

213
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:09,666
because of myself.

214
00:18:03,453 --> 00:18:05,055
Let's eat

215
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,560
America?

216
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,629
Your talent is too good

217
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:15,265
just to be used in Korea.

218
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:17,500
Thank you for the compliment.

219
00:18:18,134 --> 00:18:21,571
But I am not experienced with real games that much.

220
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:23,506
and also that...

221
00:18:23,506 --> 00:18:27,143
I want to stay with my friends and family

222
00:18:27,143 --> 00:18:31,581
How long do you think you can survive in Won Resort?

223
00:18:31,581 --> 00:18:34,607
As long as you stay here,

224
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:38,355
how much you try, you will always feel like a adopted child here.

225
00:18:38,888 --> 00:18:41,157
Don't misunderstand my intentions.

226
00:18:41,157 --> 00:18:44,267
Who ever was in that position would feel the same.

227
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:46,629
Why did you...

228
00:18:46,629 --> 00:18:47,982
Come to be particularily?

229
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:51,568
Sung Mi Soo?

230
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,371
Isn't she in your company?

231
00:18:54,371 --> 00:18:58,008
All the contracts are not completed until it ends.

232
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:01,077
Penalty and everything...

233
00:19:01,077 --> 00:19:03,013
I don't want anything complicated.

234
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:06,983
It won't be complicated.

235
00:19:06,983 --> 00:19:09,819
I am going to plea not to the president of the Won Resort

236
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:12,756
but my mother.

237
00:19:14,557 --> 00:19:17,827
This is what I do.

238
00:19:17,827 --> 00:19:19,896
I am doing this so that I can live

239
00:19:19,896 --> 00:19:24,925
but making good players play in much better condition

240
00:19:24,925 --> 00:19:26,002
makes me feel good.

241
00:19:27,603 --> 00:19:30,440
When I was in the worst situation

242
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,742
when the world was against me

243
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:37,324
the only company that held out their hand was Won Resort.

244
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:41,954
What if the Resort would just let you go easily?

245
00:19:41,954 --> 00:19:43,653
Then would you go to the States?

246
00:19:45,021 --> 00:19:47,691
It might be a little bit uncomfortable

247
00:19:47,691 --> 00:19:50,293
it can be a little bit slow

248
00:19:50,293 --> 00:19:52,929
I won't leave Won Resort.

249
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:09,379
There is no game for a while since its season off

250
00:20:09,379 --> 00:20:11,548
So I was thinking of going to Australia or New Zealand.

251
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:13,049
You going to come with me, right?

252
00:20:13,049 --> 00:20:15,719
I should also ask Mi Soo.

253
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,488
Why Mi Soo?

254
00:20:18,488 --> 00:20:20,223
You are both Won Resort players

255
00:20:20,223 --> 00:20:23,226
I don't think I can just send one player for training abroad.

256
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:28,464
What I meant by going abroad was not for the training.

257
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:29,532
Hae Ryung.

258
00:20:29,532 --> 00:20:32,936
If you don't get ready right now, games next year will get hard.

259
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:35,002
You know that better than me.

260
00:20:35,002 --> 00:20:40,777
Then I can just try harder next year and get ready for the next next year's game.

261
00:20:42,846 --> 00:20:45,782
If you are in a bad state, we should consider that.

262
00:20:45,782 --> 00:20:47,350
But Mi Soo can't just rest

263
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:49,953
because you are taking a rest.

264
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:54,391
Did you not hear?

265
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,793
Mi Soo will soon get a new coach.

266
00:20:56,793 --> 00:20:59,660
You don't have to care for her anymore.

267
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,497
What?!

268
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:03,666
New coach?

269
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,669
Mom said that she will tell you in person.

270
00:21:05,669 --> 00:21:07,103
I guess I went ahead...

271
00:21:07,103 --> 00:21:08,204
Does Mi Soo know?

272
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:11,207
Mi Soo, Mi Soo, Mi Soo...

273
00:21:11,207 --> 00:21:13,109
Now I'm really getting sick of it.

274
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:15,578
Is your head just full of Mi Soo?

275
00:21:51,047 --> 00:21:52,615
New coach...

276
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,684
then I can just find a new coach...

277
00:21:54,684 --> 00:22:00,678
<i>Subeam @ viki.comtitles brought to you by Birdy Buddy T</i>

278
00:22:08,831 --> 00:22:10,933
What exactly are you trying to do?

279
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,788
I know I did wrong

280
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:13,531
I want to be alone

281
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:15,505
If you're going to be like this, it will be difficult

282
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,142
What will be difficult?

283
00:22:19,142 --> 00:22:20,977
Difficult for you and Sung Mi Soo?

284
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,345
Stop it right now!

285
00:22:24,213 --> 00:22:26,482
Untill when are you going to be like this?

286
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:30,053
I...

287
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:31,587
am not stupid.

288
00:22:31,587 --> 00:22:33,723
I know what's right and wrong.

289
00:22:33,723 --> 00:22:36,025
I know really well that I shouldn't do this to her.

290
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:38,061
I know that she is a great person.

291
00:22:38,061 --> 00:22:39,562
But it's not going well.

292
00:22:39,562 --> 00:22:41,698
I just can't control myself when I see you two together.

293
00:22:41,698 --> 00:22:43,670
Then are you still...

294
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:46,102
going to make such a energy consuming fight?

295
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:48,671
That's why

296
00:22:48,671 --> 00:22:49,972
we should leave.

297
00:22:49,972 --> 00:22:52,108
America or anywhere!

298
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:56,209
I really didn't know you would be this selfish.

299
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:58,314
Min Hae Ryung.

300
00:22:58,815 --> 00:23:00,383
John.

301
00:23:01,484 --> 00:23:03,353
John!

302
00:23:20,961 --> 00:23:22,587
Hae Ryung!

303
00:23:22,587 --> 00:23:23,806
Mom..

304
00:23:24,273 --> 00:23:26,109
Did something happen?

305
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,444
Sung Mi Soo will go to the States.

306
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:30,546
Just let her go without saying anything.

307
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:32,482
What happened?

308
00:23:32,482 --> 00:23:36,085
Nothing happened, she will just go. So you just

309
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:38,888
let her go when she says she wants to go.

310
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:39,589
Okay?

311
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,524
Calm down and talk to me.

312
00:23:41,524 --> 00:23:44,794
I cannot undersatnd what you are trying to say.

313
00:23:45,728 --> 00:23:47,630
All you have to do is

314
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,933
just letting her go with no conditions.

315
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,768
Just do that.

316
00:23:52,768 --> 00:23:56,873
There is no reason why I should stop her from leaving to a big company in America.

317
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:59,776
I have no reason to keep the pride of the current company.

318
00:23:59,776 --> 00:24:01,044
But,

319
00:24:01,044 --> 00:24:04,781
If this is not her own choice

320
00:24:04,781 --> 00:24:06,649
I cannot agree.

321
00:24:06,649 --> 00:24:07,784
I will hold on to it.

322
00:24:07,784 --> 00:24:08,785
Min Hae Ryung!

323
00:24:08,785 --> 00:24:10,119
Why is that so hard?

324
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,288
It's a good chance for her as well.

325
00:24:13,523 --> 00:24:14,857
I will look for a new coach right away.

326
00:24:14,857 --> 00:24:16,159
New coach?

327
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,427
It won't matter.

328
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:20,563
As long as she is in Won Resort, John won't let her go!

329
00:24:20,563 --> 00:24:23,132
Why do they have to be seperated?

330
00:24:23,132 --> 00:24:25,635
The things they went through together, the relationship they have...

331
00:24:25,635 --> 00:24:28,971
those things exist but how can they act like they don't know each other?

332
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,043
Mom..

333
00:24:34,043 --> 00:24:37,332
You know what?

334
00:24:37,332 --> 00:24:39,782
I know that all.

335
00:24:39,782 --> 00:24:42,618
So every morning I tell myself in the mirror

336
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:44,787
that I shouldn't be like this today.

337
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:48,524
That Mi Soo is a good co worker.

338
00:24:48,524 --> 00:24:51,060
That John loves me only.

339
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:53,363
But it's so hard.

340
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,264
If I see John smiling at Mi Soo

341
00:24:55,264 --> 00:24:56,699
it drives me crazy!

342
00:24:56,699 --> 00:25:00,436
It kills me to see them looking at each other!

343
00:25:00,436 --> 00:25:25,294
<i>Subtitles brougt to you by Birdy Buddy Team @ viki.com</i>

344
00:25:25,294 --> 00:25:29,765
If... Won Resort just sends you off easily

345
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:31,567
would you go to America?

346
00:25:57,794 --> 00:25:59,662
You are my player, right?

347
00:25:59,662 --> 00:26:01,130
Sung Mi Soo!

348
00:26:02,765 --> 00:26:05,001
Yes, coach.

349
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:08,598
This is Sung Mi Soo.

350
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,267
I...

351
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:13,803
want to go.

352
00:27:14,504 --> 00:27:16,673
But there are some conditions.

353
00:27:17,507 --> 00:27:19,475
I want to...

354
00:27:19,475 --> 00:27:21,477
move as fast as I can.

355
00:28:38,963 --> 00:28:39,931
Really?

356
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,366
Of course!

357
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:42,833
All of a sudden?

358
00:28:42,833 --> 00:28:44,369
The manager

359
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,437
was in the awards ceremony by chance.

360
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,806
She saw me getting the rookie award

361
00:28:48,806 --> 00:28:50,842
and she had interest in me even before that.

362
00:28:50,842 --> 00:28:54,145
The world is so small you know. The president and they know each other somehow.

363
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:55,413
What did the president say?

364
00:28:55,413 --> 00:28:57,448
She obviously said okay.

365
00:28:57,448 --> 00:28:59,217
She said that it would be a good opportunity.

366
00:28:59,217 --> 00:29:03,555
But still... you didn't play much game after you became a Won Resort player.

367
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:06,290
Is it possible to change companies like this?

368
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,626
Others are suffering because they can't go.

369
00:29:08,626 --> 00:29:10,895
Why does she have to read other people's minds.

370
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,196
The president

371
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,766
also likes it better if she goes.

372
00:29:15,366 --> 00:29:17,268
What is he saying?

373
00:29:17,268 --> 00:29:18,570
Hey Sung Tae Gap!

374
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,405
He is making no sense at all.

375
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:21,606
I don't know.

376
00:29:24,108 --> 00:29:25,677
You can't even speak English!

377
00:29:25,677 --> 00:29:27,345
Are you fearless

378
00:29:27,345 --> 00:29:28,913
or

379
00:29:28,913 --> 00:29:31,364
is it that you have no other choice!

380
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:38,957
He is...

381
00:29:38,957 --> 00:29:41,226
he sometimes thinks that he is older than me.

382
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,100
Aren't you hungry?

383
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,269
Let's go out for some noodles!

384
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:00,778
I need to go on a diet!

385
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:03,281
Where do you need to loose weight?

386
00:30:03,281 --> 00:30:05,650
I'm worried the plane won't fly.

387
00:30:08,586 --> 00:30:10,655
Are you really going to go?

388
00:30:11,556 --> 00:30:13,558
Can I not go?

389
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:15,727
That's not true...but

390
00:30:15,727 --> 00:30:17,028
why do I feel...

391
00:30:17,028 --> 00:30:18,363
so bad?

392
00:30:18,363 --> 00:30:20,331
They say that chances come without notice.

393
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:22,901
I need to hold onto that chance when its here.

394
00:30:24,135 --> 00:30:26,404
What did the coach say?

395
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:28,873
Oh..

396
00:30:29,908 --> 00:30:32,977
I didn't tell him yet...

397
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:36,648
Did Min Hae Ryung ill-treat you?

398
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:38,917
Mom!

399
00:30:38,917 --> 00:30:40,385
If not,

400
00:30:40,385 --> 00:30:43,555
did coach not care of you much since he met his old lover?

401
00:30:43,555 --> 00:30:44,322
Mom!

402
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:46,124
It's either one of them!

403
00:30:46,124 --> 00:30:47,926
I am your mother! You think I won't know?

404
00:30:47,926 --> 00:30:49,961
You are my mom, but why don't you know?

405
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,596
They are both not true...

406
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,599
Mom,

407
00:30:54,599 --> 00:30:58,002
I want to just concentrate on golf.

408
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,072
If I'm here, it reminds me of master

409
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,110
bad memories of Jay Park...

410
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,247
mom, dad, and Tae Gap...

411
00:31:09,247 --> 00:31:10,815
all of them.

412
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:15,453
I just want to forget them

413
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:18,990
I want to concentrate on golf where noone is there.

414
00:31:19,624 --> 00:31:21,025
Really?

415
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,361
You...

416
00:31:23,361 --> 00:31:25,229
just...

417
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:28,266
not running away because you are hurt?

418
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:29,467
Of course!

419
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:35,940
And mom...

420
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:37,942
to coach,

421
00:31:37,942 --> 00:31:41,746
don't tell him that the president knows this company.

422
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:43,915
He might misunderstand the situation.

423
00:31:45,116 --> 00:31:47,718
Okay...

424
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:52,957
Okay so just go on and tell him for sure. He might be disappointed to know later.

425
00:31:52,957 --> 00:31:54,559
Okay.

426
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,494
I will tell him tomorrow.

427
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:07,161
I wanted to discuss with you about being a coach.

428
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:09,374
Rather than finding one all of a sudden

429
00:32:09,374 --> 00:32:11,576
I want to make a training program abroad

430
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:14,479
for both Mi Soo and Hae Ryung each.

431
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:17,749
While the winter passes as they are in the training

432
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:20,151
when a good coach comes out

433
00:32:20,151 --> 00:32:22,420
then it would be better to bring him in.

434
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:25,956
That sounds good.

435
00:32:25,956 --> 00:32:27,525
And the coach...

436
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:31,396
please look for two of them.

437
00:32:33,164 --> 00:32:34,532
I want to...

438
00:32:34,532 --> 00:32:36,201
take a rest.

439
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,008
We will take a look at bring in the new coach.

440
00:32:44,008 --> 00:32:45,577
Something might happen.

441
00:32:46,244 --> 00:32:48,237
Something?

442
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:52,483
Sung Mi Soo wants to move to a company in America.

443
00:32:52,784 --> 00:32:53,952
What?

444
00:33:02,239 --> 00:33:05,196
Did you think over it?

445
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,998
Yes.

446
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:12,337
I have the tendency to think quickly.

447
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,009
Is there anything that I can do?

448
00:33:20,478 --> 00:33:23,439
I was in America for quite long

449
00:33:23,439 --> 00:33:25,049
I might be able to help you.

450
00:33:25,049 --> 00:33:28,753
I will call you when I get there.

451
00:33:28,753 --> 00:33:32,402
I can just call you when something comes up.

452
00:33:32,402 --> 00:33:34,759
You can pay for the phone calls.

453
00:33:44,314 --> 00:33:46,704
It's coach!

454
00:33:50,341 --> 00:33:53,011
I didn't tell him yet...

455
00:33:57,317 --> 00:33:58,950
Yes coach.

456
00:34:04,622 --> 00:34:06,524
You surprised me!

457
00:34:08,493 --> 00:34:09,861
Right now?

458
00:34:11,362 --> 00:34:13,231
Where are you?

459
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,970
Okay.

460
00:34:27,745 --> 00:34:29,747
I need your

461
00:34:29,747 --> 00:34:31,583
support.

462
00:34:32,483 --> 00:34:34,385
Both coach and you

463
00:34:34,385 --> 00:34:36,287
have a lot of experience abroad

464
00:34:36,287 --> 00:34:39,057
so you might say that it's really nothing...

465
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:44,762
I really want to go.

466
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:47,966
Please say good things about all this.

467
00:34:49,601 --> 00:34:51,236
I should go.

468
00:34:53,638 --> 00:34:55,206
Bye.

469
00:34:59,244 --> 00:35:00,945
I think love is

470
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:06,050
love is important.

471
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,956
To me it is.

472
00:35:23,434 --> 00:35:27,138
I heard it in the radio

473
00:35:29,107 --> 00:35:31,342
It is hard for a person

474
00:35:32,143 --> 00:35:34,579
to find someone to love

475
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:37,081
when capable of loving someone..

476
00:35:37,649 --> 00:35:40,051
Really hard...

477
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:43,788
How good is it to you then?

478
00:35:47,325 --> 00:35:49,694
I will support you.

479
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:14,619
How can you decide so easily without talking to me?

480
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,288
So I was going to tell you now...

481
00:36:17,288 --> 00:36:19,123
It is hard for you to go right now.

482
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:21,092
If you really want to go

483
00:36:21,092 --> 00:36:22,493
I will find a place for you.

484
00:36:25,163 --> 00:36:26,864
What's the difference...

485
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:31,202
The one that you look for

486
00:36:31,202 --> 00:36:34,438
and the one that agency finds for me...

487
00:36:34,438 --> 00:36:37,708
It will be hard for you if you go out like this without any preperation.

488
00:36:37,708 --> 00:36:40,478
Did you go out with preperation?

489
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,980
In the old days...

490
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,783
Did Hae Ryung go out with preperation?

491
00:36:47,218 --> 00:36:49,187
All the golf players

492
00:36:49,187 --> 00:36:51,756
They were not fully armed

493
00:36:51,756 --> 00:36:54,425
when they went out.

494
00:36:54,425 --> 00:36:58,262
What makes you think that it will be impossible for me?

495
00:36:58,997 --> 00:37:00,698
Really...

496
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:03,134
is it really your won choice?

497
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:10,375
I want to play in a bigger stage.

498
00:37:13,244 --> 00:37:15,413
Honestly...

499
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:19,350
I really don't want to care for all the little emotional troubles...

500
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:22,520
I have nothing with me

501
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,288
and there is a very long way to go.

502
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:28,192
Ther is no time to wait...

503
00:37:29,861 --> 00:37:32,030
The surrounding is

504

505
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,570
Then let's go together.

506
00:37:40,905 --> 00:37:42,840
Until you get settled.

507
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:50,114
The three of us?

508
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,983
You want all of us to go?

509
00:37:59,057 --> 00:38:02,360
Cheers!

510
00:38:04,862 --> 00:38:08,900
Wow you are the best among us, you are even going to America!

511
00:38:09,334 --> 00:38:12,036
I know. With talent now you even get scouted.

512
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:13,404
You are awsome.

513
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:16,641
Why are you doing this?

514
00:38:16,641 --> 00:38:19,477
You know what I dream of these days?

515
00:38:19,477 --> 00:38:22,947
I dream of going to a supermarket being very hungry but not being able to speak a word

516
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:26,217
being lost and not being able to speak a word and sweating myself...

517
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,934
Wow... it really sucks.

518
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:29,787
Hey, we have our own bodies!

519
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:31,055
Body language!

520
00:38:31,055 --> 00:38:33,057
Don't try too hard to learn English

521
00:38:33,057 --> 00:38:35,293
just work on your looks!

522
00:38:35,793 --> 00:38:36,728
Looks?

523
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:39,330
Pretty women are international language itself.

524
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,233
The beauty itself...

525
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,502
You are crazy!

526
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,204
Come back as soon as you think something's wrong.

527
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:47,839
Don't try too hard on your own.

528
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:49,540
Take care of parents well.

529
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,009
Don't just date around, okay?

530
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:53,444
I will take care of them. Don't worry.

531
00:38:53,444 --> 00:38:54,979
If it's his parents

532
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:57,048
they are my parents as well.

533
00:38:57,048 --> 00:38:58,082
Hey!

534
00:38:58,082 --> 00:39:00,418
One day you would have to call Mi Soo 'Hyung Nim (a term used to call one's husbands older sister in Korea)'.

535
00:39:00,418 --> 00:39:02,487
Oh really? Should I call her that now?

536
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:03,955
Hyung Nim!

537
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:06,791
Wow!! Don't do that!

538
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,826
Hyung Nim! Nice shot in America as well!

539
00:39:10,728 --> 00:39:11,863
Let's eat now.

540
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,965
Wow!

541
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:29,681
I'm just going to go now.

542
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:31,615
I saw you yesterday.

543
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:33,951
I will call you when I get there.

544
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:35,586
Take care of what you eat.

545
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:37,422
They will take a good care after you.

546
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:38,289
Don't worry.

547
00:39:39,991 --> 00:39:42,026
Okay.

548
00:39:42,026 --> 00:39:43,394
Good bye.

549
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,332
Then...

550
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:49,567
Please take a good care of Sung Mi Soo.

551
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,569
Of course. I'll see you again.

552
00:39:56,574 --> 00:39:59,344
Sung Mi Soo is leaving today...

553
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:00,445
Did you get to see her?

554
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:01,612
I saw her yesterday.

555
00:40:01,612 --> 00:40:03,948
I hear that the manager will take her to the airport.

556
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:07,819
The person who was just with me is the manager of Sung Mi Soo's agency.

557
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:09,320
Oh...

558
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,421
I see.

559
00:40:10,421 --> 00:40:11,990
Don't worry too much.

560
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:15,860
Sung Mi Soo is much stronger than us.

561
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,794
Yes.

564
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,073
This is a famous place for a sports agency.

565
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,609
I take care of golf industry.

566

I am around all the games around the world to find a great player.

Now I am really sick of it...

571
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:22,760
Is she all that is in your head?

572
00:41:24,862 --> 00:41:28,299
I don't want to get bothered by little emotions here.

573
00:41:28,299 --> 00:41:30,468
I have a very long way to go.

Shall we go now?

They are now getting on board.

579

Of course.

580
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:08,833
Coach!

What are you doing?

582
00:43:16,808 --> 00:43:18,276
There is something I need to check.

583
00:43:19,577 --> 00:43:21,212
This isn't right.

584

Please call Hae Ryung.

That things got a little bit wrong.

Let's go.

590
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:20,738
Things got more complicated.

591
00:44:20,738 --> 00:44:23,140
I will go on a evening plane.

592
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:24,825
You can't.

593
00:44:24,825 --> 00:44:26,544
Why are you doing this to me?

594
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:28,846
What is the reason for you going to America all of a sudden?

595
00:44:28,846 --> 00:44:30,915
Did someone ask you to move out?

596
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:32,984
Your hometown, your family...

597
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:34,986
Why are you leaving by leaving all this behind?

598
00:44:34,986 --> 00:44:35,920
Why?!

599
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:39,691
I am going because I want to.

600
00:44:39,691 --> 00:44:42,192
Because you want to go?

601
00:44:42,192 --> 00:44:45,696
You knew that Hae Ryung was behind that manager.

602
00:44:45,696 --> 00:44:48,232
You knew that but why did you go?

603
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:54,605
If you smile, that's enough for me.

604
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:59,176
Do you know that?

605
00:44:59,176 --> 00:45:02,280
Rather than me smiling, when you feel good

606
00:45:03,047 --> 00:45:05,216
and when you can smile, that is enough for me.

607
00:45:05,216 --> 00:45:06,250
Why?

608
00:45:06,784 --> 00:45:08,882
Why?

609
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,417
What am I to you?

610
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:12,764
What am I that makes you sacrifice all this?

611
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:19,860
'Cause I love you..

get the great triumph this year?

623
00:47:00,927 --> 00:47:02,763
The motive?

624

disappear like that?

633
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:58,352
