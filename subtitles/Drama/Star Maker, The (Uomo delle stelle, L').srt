1
00:00:02,437 --> 00:00:03,967
(K-Pop Star 6)

2
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,567
(Last week)

3
00:00:07,367 --> 00:00:10,137
(We watched the heated performances of six unique vocalists.)

4
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:14,467
(The competition is tight, as they are all talented.)

5
00:00:16,297 --> 00:00:17,967
(The results are announced!)

6
00:00:17,967 --> 00:00:20,337
(Yoo Jin, Bo Mi, Seo Jin, Da On, Myeong Seong, Yoon Ji)

7
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:24,567
(Up to Seo Jin, who was third best...)

8
00:00:25,497 --> 00:00:27,807
(will go onto round 3.)

9
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:30,937
(Three contestants are eliminated, including Seo Myeong Seong.)

10
00:00:32,237 --> 00:00:36,697
(Half of them passed and the other half were eliminated.)

11
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:40,697
(Their stage comes to an end with sad good-byes.)

12
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,667
(The second round of performances will come up next.)

13
00:00:47,474 --> 00:00:50,204
The winner of K-Pop Star will be awarded 300,000 dollars,

14
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:09,851
(Which group is up next?)

15
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:13,791
(It's the Children's group, which caused a sensation.)

16
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:17,051
(The contestants are focused as they practice.)

17
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:19,651
We've had several talented children on the other seasons,

18
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:22,221
but the contestants on this season are the most talented.

19
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:25,551
It's not just potential I see.

20
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:27,751
They're already very good.

21
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,691
I was surprised at how good they are.

22
00:01:31,691 --> 00:01:33,921
I've spotted some amazing acts.

23
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:37,121
(The young contestants were highly praised during the first round.)

24
00:01:37,121 --> 00:01:40,321
It'll be a fierce competition among these children.

25
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,591
They're like the Avengers.

26
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:47,151
(Knowing how good the others are, there is tension in the air.)

27
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:59,491
(Lee Ga Do was praised for her great voice.)

28
00:02:00,151 --> 00:02:03,861
She goes beyond your imagination. She's scarily good.

29
00:02:07,321 --> 00:02:10,721
(11-year-old Kim Jong Seob showed off his dance and an original rap.)

30
00:02:10,721 --> 00:02:14,091
It's unbelievable that he can rap like that at 11 years old.

31
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,621
I feel like I'm watching a young Zico.

32
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:25,651
(10-year-old Han Byeol mesmerized the judges with her dance moves.)

33
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,251
I've been a dancer for 40 years...

34
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:32,951
and the fact that I was captivated by her dance...

35
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,821
means she's amazingly talented.

36
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,351
(11-year-old Park Hyun Jin showed off his original rap full of swag.)

37
00:02:39,351 --> 00:02:41,521
He's good, he has talent.

38
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,351
He has charisma.

39
00:02:46,821 --> 00:02:50,791
(12-year-old Hong Jung Min was acknowledged for her clear voice.)

40
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:53,791
She is gifted in singing.

41
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,351
Her tune, beat and the emotions she shows...

42
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,021
surprise me.

43
00:03:00,921 --> 00:03:03,151
Who do you think is the best?

44
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:06,791
Frankly, I think Ga Do is the best.

45
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:08,851
I think Ga Do is very good.

46
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:12,591
She doesn't have any trouble hitting high notes.

47
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,921
Her voice is perfect.

48
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:17,721
How well do you think you will do?

49
00:03:17,721 --> 00:03:21,451
I'm cautious when I make assumptions,

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,651
but I'd like to be second best.

51
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,951
You'd like to be second best?

52
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:25,951
No.

53
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,351
I want to be better than Ga Do.

54
00:03:30,651 --> 00:03:31,651
Do you want to be in first place?

55
00:03:31,651 --> 00:03:32,651
Yes.

56
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,621
Dance!

57
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:37,591
I think I can beat Jong Seob in dancing.

58
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,751
- With your dance? - Judge Yang Hyun Suk said...

59
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:42,791
I was a better dancer.

60
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:45,651
All the contestants were so good,

61
00:03:45,651 --> 00:03:48,451
so that motivated me.

62
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:52,491
Let's have the next group on stage.

63
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:58,421
(They have high expectations for the skilled children.)

64
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:08,221
(The talented young contestants walk onto the stage.)

65
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:16,051
Could you introduce yourselves?

66
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:17,621
In 1, 2, 3.

67
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:21,221
Hi, we're small but strong...

68
00:04:22,021 --> 00:04:23,091
Strong...

69
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,221
Small...

70
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,791
bean...

71
00:04:27,051 --> 00:04:28,521
bullets!

72
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:31,251
(Sighing)

73
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:35,251
(The judges look pleased.)

74
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:36,691
They're the small bean bullets.

75
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:39,251
They're so cute.

76
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:42,721
Ga Do looks like a small bean bullet.

77
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:44,891
(Cute)

78
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:51,721
They're so cute, but one interesting thing...

79
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:54,251
about the young contestants this season...

80
00:04:54,751 --> 00:04:56,351
is that they are very talented.

81
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,421
- Compared to other seasons. - They are the most talented...

82
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:00,021
out of all the seasons.

83
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:03,521
The audience will be shocked as they watch these children.

84
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:07,451
They're better than those in their twenties.

85
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:10,451
I think one of them might even be the winner.

86
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:12,221
- I wouldn't be surprised. - You're right.

87
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,621
- It isn't about age. - Seeing how gifted they are,

88
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:16,551
there is a high possibility that might happen.

89
00:05:16,551 --> 00:05:20,121
Have confidence and show us a good performance.

90
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:23,591
We'll begin with the first act...

91
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,151
of Small Bean Bullet.

92
00:05:26,991 --> 00:05:30,451
(Who will be performing first in the fierce competition?)

93
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:34,621
Hi, I'm 12-year-old Kim Jong Seob.

94
00:05:35,391 --> 00:05:37,751
(All the judges are focused.)

95
00:05:40,051 --> 00:05:41,921
- How are you? - Okay.

96
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,851
Last time you performed,

97
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:47,221
the guest judges that are here again...

98
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:51,221
all gave you a yes.

99
00:05:51,221 --> 00:05:52,221
Right.

100
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,551
(He not only performed an original rap, but also danced.)

101
00:05:57,551 --> 00:05:59,991
I feel like he's shown us his talent and smart brain.

102
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,121
He's good at writing lyrics and a gifted dancer.

103
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:06,391
It's a great combination if you have both.

104
00:06:06,391 --> 00:06:08,021
(The judges unanimously gave the 11-year-old a yes.)

105
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:10,351
I thought I'd mess up because I was nervous,

106
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,791
but I had fun, once I was on stage.

107
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,251
I wasn't very nervous.

108
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,951
I felt good.

109
00:06:16,391 --> 00:06:20,291
When you told your parents you wanted to rap and dance,

110
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:21,751
were they against it?

111
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:24,291
- Didn't they tell you to study? - No, they weren't against it.

112
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,121
My parents are musicians, too.

113
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,151
My dad is a modern dancer...

114
00:06:31,151 --> 00:06:34,621
and my mom is a jazz dancer.

115
00:06:35,891 --> 00:06:39,021
I think I take after them.

116
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:40,391
I got my dancing skills from them.

117
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,551
Are you going to dance today?

118
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:47,851
Yes, I'm dancing to "Take You Down" by Chris Brown.

119
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:50,821
I've never been in love,

120
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:55,221
but I'm going to imagine that I am while I dance.

121
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:58,591
Do you think about the lyrics when you dance?

122
00:06:58,591 --> 00:07:02,191
Dancing isn't just about the beat...

123
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:05,751
and moving to the rhythm, but you have to think about the lyrics.

124
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:09,491
You have to deliver emotions through your dance moves.

125
00:07:09,491 --> 00:07:11,191
That's what I think.

126
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:13,691
I'd say it's more difficult than singing.

127
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,251
If you add emotion to each move,

128
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:19,721
the audience can see the sincerity behind it.

129
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,591
I believe emotions are involved in dancing.

130
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,391
(Wow.)

131
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:27,251
(The 11-year-old boy has a deep insight of music.)

132
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:32,091
What have you prepared for us today?

133
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:35,191
It's an original rap I wrote...

134
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:37,491
called "Destiny".

135
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:39,991
All right, let's hear it first.

136
00:07:39,991 --> 00:07:40,991
Okay.

137
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,591
(Will he be able to put on a stage more surprising than the last time?)

138
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,491
("Destiny")

139
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:04,291
("Destiny" by Kim Jong Seob)

140
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:41,761
(He did well.)

141
00:09:42,991 --> 00:09:46,291
(People passionately applaud him.)

142
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,221
Why are the kids so good?

143
00:09:53,891 --> 00:09:56,651
What's shocking is that he dances well too.

144
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,021
- Really? - Yes.

145
00:09:58,451 --> 00:09:59,691
- Let's see it. - Can you dance for us?

146
00:09:59,691 --> 00:10:02,351
(They're just as excited for his dance.)

147
00:10:06,951 --> 00:10:08,351
Kids are good.

148
00:10:09,991 --> 00:10:15,121
I think when you dance, every move has to convey emotion.

149
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:16,421
(This 11-year-old boy has his own philosophy on dancing.)

150
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:42,091
(Jin Young screams.)

151
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,191
(Deeply moved, they cheer and applaud him.)

152
00:11:46,621 --> 00:11:47,821
He's really good.

153
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:52,391
- He's very good. - He's unbelievable.

154
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:57,651
(Everyone can't believe how good this 11-year-old can dance.)

155
00:11:58,751 --> 00:11:59,991
(He's awesome.)

156
00:12:06,651 --> 00:12:07,691
This is crazy.

157
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:10,021
(They can't calm down easily.)

158
00:12:15,451 --> 00:12:17,021
What do we do with him really?

159
00:12:24,451 --> 00:12:26,551
Why is my heart fluttering because of the 11-year-old?

160
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:28,521
It was his last move.

161
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,891
This is how it feels.

162
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:39,151
I want to take him and run away from K-Pop Star.

163
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,551
- You want to snatch him away. - I want to disappear with him.

164
00:12:45,321 --> 00:12:48,391
(Jong Seob seems dazed.)

165
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,891
Where should I begin?

166
00:12:51,921 --> 00:12:53,121
First of all, he raps...

167
00:12:54,121 --> 00:12:57,821
- There's a rap competition TV show. - Yes.

168
00:12:58,451 --> 00:13:03,751
When you watch it, you can see that even professionals forget lyrics.

169
00:13:04,321 --> 00:13:05,721
- There's too much to remember. - They make mistakes too.

170
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,651
He's so young, and he's been performing in front of many cameras,

171
00:13:09,951 --> 00:13:13,621
but he's never made a mistake with the lyrics in the two rounds.

172
00:13:17,621 --> 00:13:20,021
Even if we disregard everything else, that's something on its own.

173
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,951
And yet he's also got a great flow and delivery.

174
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:26,791
They are not done by the book though.

175
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,351
When he rides the rhythm, he does it on his own way.

176
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,451
Whether it's triplet or sixteenth note...

177
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:34,021
He doesn't know what those are, but he totally owns them.

178
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:36,791
When he sings a song, he absorbs it completely and makes it his own.

179
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,221
Did you see the pose?

180
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:40,951
After saying "my destiny", he took a break and did this.

181
00:13:40,951 --> 00:13:42,221
(He continues to comment with much excitement.)

182
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:43,751
He's got composure,

183
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,291
great dance...

184
00:13:46,991 --> 00:13:51,691
It's really funny. When Jin Young was complimenting Jong Seob,

185
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:52,951
Hyun Jin in the back went...

186
00:13:53,191 --> 00:13:54,351
"yes".

187
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,891
- I was saying... - He's nodding his head.

188
00:13:58,291 --> 00:13:59,351
It's like he's thinking...

189
00:13:59,351 --> 00:14:01,721
"He's pretty good."

190
00:14:05,851 --> 00:14:08,121
The most shocking thing about his rap and dance is that...

191
00:14:08,121 --> 00:14:11,121
he takes little breaks. He's just 11 years old,

192
00:14:11,121 --> 00:14:16,191
and he knows to give a little space in between his moves.

193
00:14:16,621 --> 00:14:17,821
I don't understand how relaxed he is.

194
00:14:20,021 --> 00:14:21,921
I think when it comes to dancing,

195
00:14:22,551 --> 00:14:24,991
he doesn't measure up to me and Jin Young yet.

196
00:14:26,851 --> 00:14:29,521
When it comes to rapping, he's much better than us.

197
00:14:30,091 --> 00:14:31,151
Thank you.

198
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:33,991
You look like you're not approving it.

199
00:14:33,991 --> 00:14:35,791
That's not it. We're not even rappers.

200
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,921
- It's not a compliment for him. - Right.

201
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,951
It's a compliment if you say he's better than Eminem.

202
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:44,391
Jin Young and I...

203
00:14:45,221 --> 00:14:48,191
are not looking at Lee Jong Seob as he is now but we are...

204
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,551
- His name is Kim Jong Seob. - I am sorry.

205
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:51,621
We are not looking at how talented Kim Jong Seob is now...

206
00:14:51,621 --> 00:14:56,391
but how he will be in two to three years. We've been seeing...

207
00:14:56,721 --> 00:14:58,191
many people, and we are very surprised.

208
00:14:58,191 --> 00:15:02,651
Your dance is unbelievable.

209
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:06,891
You did so well today that I can't wait for your next performance.

210
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:08,591
- Thank you. - Thank you.

211
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:16,551
There was a reason why the guest judges all passed him.

212
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:19,121
They are very precise.

213
00:15:19,421 --> 00:15:20,821
More than anything...

214
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:26,591
I wrote things like this on my diary when I was 10 years old.

215
00:15:26,851 --> 00:15:28,221
"I went to school today."

216
00:15:29,191 --> 00:15:30,751
"I played with Jin Young."

217
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,021
"It was really fun."

218
00:15:32,621 --> 00:15:35,751
That was the level of my writing.

219
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:38,551
But Jong Seob's rap is...

220
00:15:39,251 --> 00:15:40,291
Goodness.

221
00:15:41,451 --> 00:15:43,691
"It's like a nightmare virus, your talent is minus".

222
00:15:43,691 --> 00:15:46,121
"I gained a lot of weight because of you but I'll go on a diet now".

223
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:48,551
It goes on and on like this.

224
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,151
First of all, his writing is impressive.

225
00:15:52,151 --> 00:15:56,191
He didn't just write. He got all the rhymes.

226
00:15:56,391 --> 00:15:59,391
Also, you have to restrain the word count for the flow.

227
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:01,021
He manages to do all that.

228
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:02,551
It means he was born to be a rapper.

229
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:05,891
If he's a high school student, I'd say he tried hard.

230
00:16:05,891 --> 00:16:08,421
But it's a different story when he's a 11-year-old.

231
00:16:08,721 --> 00:16:10,391
This is your natural talent.

232
00:16:10,651 --> 00:16:12,451
Five years later...

233
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:14,321
After five years, he will only be a middle school student.

234
00:16:14,321 --> 00:16:16,151
Who will he be in the future?

235
00:16:16,151 --> 00:16:19,391
He dances so well, and he writes amazing lyrics.

236
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:21,351
You got an unbelievable talent.

237
00:16:21,351 --> 00:16:23,721
(We're excited to see him grow even more.)

238
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:27,021
In the future, you will rap and dance effortlessly.

239
00:16:27,851 --> 00:16:29,851
- You got an amazing talent. - He already does it effortlessly.

240
00:16:30,021 --> 00:16:31,291
You got an amazing talent.

241
00:16:32,921 --> 00:16:35,091
- Thank you. - Thank you.

242
00:16:35,691 --> 00:16:38,521
(The first performer Jong Seob got the highest compliments.)

243
00:16:39,121 --> 00:16:42,721
(The amazing first performance raises the expectation.)

244
00:16:44,021 --> 00:16:47,591
(Who is the second contestant?)

245
00:16:49,451 --> 00:16:53,351
Hello, I am Lee Ga Do from Changwon. I am 10 years old.

246
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,451
(She's cute.)

247
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:01,891
The previous contestant was praised so much...

248
00:17:01,891 --> 00:17:04,021
that she must be pressured. How do you feel?

249
00:17:04,821 --> 00:17:08,191
- I am a little pressured. - I see.

250
00:17:08,521 --> 00:17:11,221
She's got something.

251
00:17:11,251 --> 00:17:15,391
Last time, all the guest judges passed her.

252
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,021
(She was the first one to get a yes from all the guest judges.)

253
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:20,351
Are you more nervous than you were on the first round?

254
00:17:20,751 --> 00:17:22,391
I am all right now.

255
00:17:23,191 --> 00:17:24,351
I don't think she's nervous.

256
00:17:24,351 --> 00:17:25,821
All right. Enjoy it then.

257
00:17:25,821 --> 00:17:29,091
The real star does even better in this situation.

258
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,791
- Let's give it a go. - Okay.

259
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:39,691
(Everyone in the Children group chose her to rank No. 1.)

260
00:17:39,821 --> 00:17:42,521
(Will she surprise us again?)

261
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:49,851
("Domino" by Jessie J)

262
00:19:41,891 --> 00:19:45,021
(Everyone cheers passionately.)

263
00:19:53,551 --> 00:19:56,021
Can you play the keyboard?

264
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:57,421
What was the key?

265
00:19:59,391 --> 00:20:00,851
Flat.

266
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,621
- Do sharp. - D flat.

267
00:20:02,961 --> 00:20:06,461
The note she kept hitting...

268
00:20:07,121 --> 00:20:09,221
was D flat, do sharp.

269
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:13,651
Usually, girl group vocalists...

270
00:20:14,121 --> 00:20:17,021
can sing as high as do.

271
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:19,121
Someone who can sing a little higher manages to sing as high as do sharp.

272
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:23,621
She didn't hit that note just sometimes. She kept hitting it.

273
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:26,961
She didn't bend the notes. She hit them precisely.

274
00:20:27,421 --> 00:20:29,791
That's really hard to do.

275
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,851
Goodness. She doesn't have any bad habits.

276
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:37,551
Her voice, vocalization, and breathing are all very good.

277
00:20:37,751 --> 00:20:39,121
Her interpretation, feeling,

278
00:20:39,121 --> 00:20:41,121
and sense of rhythm are amazing as well.

279
00:20:41,551 --> 00:20:44,491
She's unbelievable. Her singing is truly shocking.

280
00:20:45,251 --> 00:20:46,621
Her singing is shocking.

281
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,651
The only problem was...

282
00:20:51,721 --> 00:20:53,821
(The only problem was)

283
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:56,821
that you were a little more nervous than the first round.

284
00:20:56,821 --> 00:20:59,291
(Jin Young points out that she was nervous.)

285
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:03,221
You were enjoying the performance a little less.

286
00:21:05,021 --> 00:21:07,321
That was the only problem. As far as your singing ability...

287
00:21:08,021 --> 00:21:09,791
is concerned, you got an unbelievable talent.

288
00:21:10,991 --> 00:21:12,091
Thank you.

289
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:22,321
I thought it wasn't the best choice of a song.

290
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:26,021
The song is in repetition.

291
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:28,821
You could have showed us more what you are capable of.

292
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,851
(Hyun Suk wanted to see more of what she could do.)

293
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:36,021
I was so surprised by you on the last round.

294
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,621
She's like someone...

295
00:21:38,921 --> 00:21:42,591
who can measure 10 meters.

296
00:21:43,021 --> 00:21:46,491
However, today she only got to measure 10cm.

297
00:21:47,191 --> 00:21:48,551
You didn't get to use all your talents.

298
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:53,121
Jin Young said that...

299
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:54,891
you hit high notes very well.

300
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:57,391
That's very important too,

301
00:21:57,391 --> 00:21:59,451
but you could've chosen a song with a more interesting development...

302
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:01,551
and shown us more things.

303
00:22:01,951 --> 00:22:03,821
Personally, I feel sorry.

304
00:22:03,951 --> 00:22:06,151
If I were your producer,

305
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:09,191
I'd be sorry that you didn't get to show everything you got.

306
00:22:09,351 --> 00:22:10,351
Okay.

307
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,151
(Compared to the first round,)

308
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:16,291
(she's not getting as much compliments as she did.)

309
00:22:16,521 --> 00:22:18,321
I don't know if it was just me.

310
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:21,851
When Ga Do sing the first note,

311
00:22:23,151 --> 00:22:26,651
she doesn't sound like a young contestant at all.

312
00:22:29,721 --> 00:22:32,221
If we did a blind test...

313
00:22:32,221 --> 00:22:34,021
or if we were turned back,

314
00:22:34,551 --> 00:22:35,551
we would guess her...

315
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:38,691
to at least be a high school student.

316
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:40,851
Her voice has been ripened.

317
00:22:41,621 --> 00:22:44,991
That's what I would think.

318
00:22:45,821 --> 00:22:49,191
Other contestants in this show were born with...

319
00:22:49,191 --> 00:22:51,291
dancing and entertaining talents,

320
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:54,151
and she was born with a full voice.

321
00:22:54,151 --> 00:22:56,291
- She's got other talents too. - She's got other talents.

322
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,991
You were gifted with a rich voice.

323
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:03,021
But the song you chose...

324
00:23:03,391 --> 00:23:07,521
didn't show your singing ability delicately.

325
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:11,721
It's a song designed for a performance.

326
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:14,451
It's not designed to emphasize your singing.

327
00:23:14,451 --> 00:23:18,951
Next time, you should choose a song that can show your singing more.

328
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:19,991
Okay.

329
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,651
At first, we thought this group was a bean bomb.

330
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,851
But I now think they are a nuclear bomb.

331
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:30,221
- Thank you. - Thank you.

332
00:23:30,221 --> 00:23:31,221
Thank you.

333
00:23:33,021 --> 00:23:36,921
(The Children group are armed with a variety of talents.)

334
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,351
She did well.

335
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:44,451
(What would be the result for Ga Do?)

336
00:23:44,891 --> 00:23:46,391
Next contestant, please.

337
00:23:52,151 --> 00:23:54,991
Hello. I am Park Hyun Jin. I am from class 2 of fifth grade...

338
00:23:54,991 --> 00:23:57,321
from Youngseo Elementary School.

339
00:23:58,591 --> 00:24:00,991
- Hello. Have you been well? - Yes.

340
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,391
How have you been?

341
00:24:02,391 --> 00:24:05,251
I practiced a lot,

342
00:24:05,251 --> 00:24:07,351
and I practiced breathing a lot.

343
00:24:07,591 --> 00:24:09,551
I think I just played when I was his age.

344
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:12,021
I played with the stones.

345
00:24:12,591 --> 00:24:14,021
- We played Squid. - Right.

346
00:24:14,021 --> 00:24:15,321
That's what we did when we were their age.

347
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,551
(The young children these days don't know those games.)

348
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:17,821
Which song will you be singing today?

349
00:24:17,821 --> 00:24:21,921
I will sing Kim Gun Mo's "The Day We Broke Up".

350
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:24,721
Mr. Kim Gun Mo's "The Day We Broke Up".

351
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:26,551
What was the focus of your practice?

352
00:24:26,721 --> 00:24:30,991
The key was higher than the key of the original song,

353
00:24:31,251 --> 00:24:32,691
so I practiced singing high.

354
00:24:32,691 --> 00:24:35,021
I couldn't sing high clearly,

355
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:38,221
so I tried to study how to sing high clearly.

356
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:39,551
(He's amazing.)

357
00:24:39,551 --> 00:24:43,121
You prepared to dance too. How did you practice dancing?

358
00:24:43,121 --> 00:24:45,491
I practiced dancing while thinking about...

359
00:24:45,491 --> 00:24:48,291
where to make big moves and where to make small moves.

360
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:49,591
Did you study at a dancing academy?

361
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:50,891
- No. - Then?

362
00:24:50,891 --> 00:24:52,021
I did it alone.

363
00:24:52,321 --> 00:24:54,191
Did you do the choreography?

364
00:24:54,191 --> 00:24:57,021
No, I came up with the hat performance.

365
00:24:57,121 --> 00:25:00,021
I copied the original dance.

366
00:25:00,321 --> 00:25:02,191
- You copied it. - Yes.

367
00:25:02,491 --> 00:25:03,821
Goodness.

368
00:25:03,951 --> 00:25:05,921
Like how you copy codes, we often...

369
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,651
copy dances too.

370
00:25:07,651 --> 00:25:11,151
- When you see dancers, - Right.

371
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:12,991
- they copy other performers. - Right.

372
00:25:12,991 --> 00:25:14,251
You two started like that too, didn't you?

373
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:15,291
Right.

374
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:18,621
It's just strange to hear it from such a young person.

375
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:21,591
He talks about studying and analyzing music.

376
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:24,991
He must be very smart.

377
00:25:27,321 --> 00:25:31,191
(On the first round, he did his own rap.)

378
00:25:36,321 --> 00:25:38,391
Does he have potential as a rapper?

379
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:40,191
He does. He has a lot of potential.

380
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:43,191
But will he be able to rap like this on the upcoming rounds?

381
00:25:43,191 --> 00:25:44,951
Will his rap be as good as this?

382
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:46,491
I don't think so.

383
00:25:48,091 --> 00:25:49,121
But...

384
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:51,551
I think he will sing very well.

385
00:25:52,591 --> 00:25:53,621
His voice is...

386
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:55,551
(Jin Young must've found something about his voice.)

387
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:59,221
I hope you will just sing on the upcoming rounds.

388
00:25:59,451 --> 00:26:01,651
(Jin Young trusted his potential and gave him a pass.)

389
00:26:02,851 --> 00:26:04,591
Hyun Jin is next.

390
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:09,491
(He accepted Jin Young's advice and prepared to sing.)

391
00:26:14,221 --> 00:26:15,891
What's this key?

392
00:26:15,891 --> 00:26:16,891
E?

393
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:19,851
Is this B?

394
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,551
(Even Hyun Jin didn't know he could sing this high.)

395
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:27,791
In the far future Will you be able go this high?

396
00:26:27,791 --> 00:26:29,151
What is it? Is it re?

397
00:26:29,151 --> 00:26:31,221
Even girls can't sing that high. All right.

398
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,521
Let's do this. Just hit the highest note you can.

399
00:26:34,521 --> 00:26:37,921
In the far future Like this.

400
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:39,351
In chest voice.

401
00:26:39,951 --> 00:26:41,521
He rapped when he could sing like this.

402
00:26:41,521 --> 00:26:42,851
- He almost got eliminated. - I know.

403
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,651
He's a multi-player.

404
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:48,791
I've been rapping a lot,

405
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,891
and I've been practicing to rap.

406
00:26:50,891 --> 00:26:54,221
I haven't been singing as much as I have been rapping.

407
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:57,921
I practiced rapping hard, but I couldn't do it.

408
00:26:57,921 --> 00:27:01,391
So I felt quite sad that day,

409
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:04,791
but I think this is the time when I can improve myself with feedbacks.

410
00:27:05,121 --> 00:27:08,551
I started by practicing the breathing and then...

411
00:27:08,551 --> 00:27:13,191
I practiced how to sing with the proper shape of my mouth.

412
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,091
In your group, there's a contestant...

413
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:20,551
named Jong Seob, and he will be rapping.

414
00:27:20,551 --> 00:27:23,551
Would you be sad when you see him rap?

415
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:27,721
When I saw Jong Seob rap,

416
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:30,721
I envied him.

417
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,021
I envy him that he gets to rap.

418
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:39,351
(How will the 11-year-old Hyun Jin convey his emotions?)

419
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:42,821
I initially joined the competition as a rapper,

420
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,891
and I won't get to rap for a while now.

421
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,791
I will sing while thinking about that.

422
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:50,191
So it's a breakup with rap.

423
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,221
Yes.

424
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:55,691
We will listen to your singing and talk more.

425
00:27:55,691 --> 00:27:56,721
Okay.

426
00:27:56,891 --> 00:28:00,191
(He will sing with sad emotion of breaking up with rap.)

427
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:04,121
(The 11-year-old boy's first on-stage performance)

428
00:28:06,791 --> 00:28:11,621
("The Day We Broke Up" by Kim Gun Mo)

429
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:36,621
How lovely.

430
00:28:39,691 --> 00:28:43,751
(He sings with the innocence of his age.)

431
00:30:39,451 --> 00:30:40,451
He's good.

432
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:41,721
That was great.

433
00:30:42,451 --> 00:30:43,551
He's so pure.

434
00:30:45,991 --> 00:30:47,921
(His first attempt is over.)

435
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:55,491
Jin Young's making this raspy sound...

436
00:30:55,551 --> 00:30:58,221
as if he's been drinking.

437
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,621
He really studied the song.

438
00:31:01,021 --> 00:31:03,091
He sang it so well.

439
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:04,421
(Isn't he great?)

440
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:07,121
Shall we see his dance?

441
00:31:07,521 --> 00:31:09,091
I don't think we need to.

442
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:11,291
- He's slays it. - Does he really slay it?

443
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:12,991
- He is fantastic. - Does he?

444
00:31:14,391 --> 00:31:16,251
He better slay it.

445
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:18,621
Put your mic down and get ready to dance.

446
00:31:20,151 --> 00:31:21,351
How old are you guys?

447
00:31:21,351 --> 00:31:23,651
You're talking about slaying and being slayed.

448
00:31:24,821 --> 00:31:26,821
You both will turn 50 soon.

449
00:31:30,651 --> 00:31:31,891
Show us what you can do.

450
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:26,391
(Wow.)

451
00:32:26,391 --> 00:32:27,821
Well done. Well done.

452
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:40,091
(They watched it while holding their breath.)

453
00:32:41,451 --> 00:32:43,721
This is what you call a dance.

454
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:50,791
He's a great dancer.

455
00:32:50,991 --> 00:32:53,821
It's not the kind of dance where he learned...

456
00:32:53,821 --> 00:32:56,121
when and how to move.

457
00:32:56,121 --> 00:32:58,591
Real dancing is lip syncing the words...

458
00:32:58,591 --> 00:33:01,491
to a song as you enjoy it.

459
00:33:01,651 --> 00:33:04,491
Since we're judging, let me add to this.

460
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:08,491
Some people will think his singing and dancing was just so-so.

461
00:33:08,921 --> 00:33:11,251
He didn't scream when he sang...

462
00:33:11,421 --> 00:33:13,591
and he didn't pop any joints when he danced.

463
00:33:14,391 --> 00:33:15,391
It's just...

464
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,491
It's so organic.

465
00:33:19,021 --> 00:33:20,891
There were no additives whatsoever.

466
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:22,851
He just danced naturally with the lyrics.

467
00:33:22,851 --> 00:33:24,851
He just moved however he wanted.

468
00:33:25,121 --> 00:33:28,721
When I tell people to sing and dance without trying too hard,

469
00:33:28,721 --> 00:33:30,121
this is what I want.

470
00:33:30,151 --> 00:33:33,491
He didn't go overboard to impress us or show off...

471
00:33:33,491 --> 00:33:35,851
and that alone was still enough.

472
00:33:36,651 --> 00:33:38,721
Once you start teaching someone like him,

473
00:33:38,721 --> 00:33:41,391
the speed at which they absorb things is incredible.

474
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,551
Can I ask you something? Do you not have a dance teacher?

475
00:33:45,551 --> 00:33:47,321
- I don't. - This kid...

476
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:48,851
Did you teach yourself?

477
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:50,951
Yes, I copied the dancers.

478
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,621
Copying a dancer's choreography...

479
00:33:55,621 --> 00:33:57,691
- is something you can learn. - Anyone can do that.

480
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:00,721
Most instructors teach specific moves but this boy...

481
00:34:00,721 --> 00:34:04,691
ignored that and freestyled his way through.

482
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:08,321
That is why Jin Young and I are so shocked.

483
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:09,321
He slayed it, right?

484
00:34:10,021 --> 00:34:11,191
Honestly, yes or no?

485
00:34:11,191 --> 00:34:12,791
- He slayed it. - Right?

486
00:34:12,991 --> 00:34:14,621
Let me tell you why.

487
00:34:14,861 --> 00:34:18,151
I have no other option but to compare him to G-Dragon.

488
00:34:18,151 --> 00:34:20,751
G-Dragon signed with me when he was 13.

489
00:34:21,521 --> 00:34:24,751
When he was that age, he wasn't this good of a dancer.

490
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:29,121
He was a rapper, so he couldn't sing this well, either.

491
00:34:29,321 --> 00:34:32,591
What really surprised me is that in the first round...

492
00:34:32,591 --> 00:34:34,551
this kid rapped.

493
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,221
At the in-depth audition...

494
00:34:36,921 --> 00:34:38,821
I suggested he sing a song...

495
00:34:39,091 --> 00:34:41,151
and he was incredibly good.

496
00:34:41,151 --> 00:34:42,921
You were there, Jin Young.

497
00:34:42,921 --> 00:34:45,251
Hyun Jin, who told you to sing in the first round?

498
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:48,391
You did, Jin Young.

499
00:34:49,321 --> 00:34:50,651
Don't you forget that.

500
00:34:50,651 --> 00:34:51,651
Okay.

501
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:56,361
I will...

502
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:58,221
guarantee you this.

503
00:34:59,521 --> 00:35:03,121
This boy will become the future of K-pop.

504
00:35:03,121 --> 00:35:05,121
The future of K-pop.

505
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:07,291
He can. He really can.

506
00:35:07,621 --> 00:35:08,621
I mean it.

507
00:35:12,521 --> 00:35:16,361
If being a K-pop star means to lead...

508
00:35:16,651 --> 00:35:18,491
the next Korean Wave,

509
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,821
he will become a K-pop star.

510
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,621
I'd love it if you'd become...

511
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,551
the future of K-pop and of JYP.

512
00:35:27,651 --> 00:35:29,151
Who told you to sing?

513
00:35:29,151 --> 00:35:30,621
You did.

514
00:35:32,861 --> 00:35:34,791
I feel like I'm at a disadvantage.

515
00:35:37,021 --> 00:35:39,521
You said your favorite singer is Big Bang.

516
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:43,151
Does YG still stand a chance?

517
00:35:45,091 --> 00:35:48,091
I think you can become the future of YG.

518
00:35:48,491 --> 00:35:50,151
That's all I have to say.

519
00:35:56,291 --> 00:35:58,721
The question that I kept on asking him was...

520
00:35:58,721 --> 00:36:02,121
if he has a dance instructor and he said he didn't, it was choreography.

521
00:36:02,121 --> 00:36:04,221
Did you ever take singing lessons?

522
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:07,951
No. I just listen to songs and sing along.

523
00:36:07,951 --> 00:36:09,891
- You just sing along? - Yes.

524
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,861
I asked that for a reason.

525
00:36:12,191 --> 00:36:14,861
When a child shows promise in a certain field,

526
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:17,921
especially music or art,

527
00:36:17,921 --> 00:36:20,751
and they even enjoy doing it,

528
00:36:20,991 --> 00:36:22,991
parents send them to classes.

529
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:26,421
What's most important for kids Hyun Jin's age...

530
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:29,391
is to let them do what they like and play.

531
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,791
Are your parents like that?

532
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,991
Yes. They leave me alone and...

533
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:35,651
told me to do what I like.

534
00:36:36,691 --> 00:36:38,721
That's not an easy thing for parents to do.

535
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:42,361
I think he's so natural because he had no teachers.

536
00:36:42,421 --> 00:36:44,021
Because he had fun.

537
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:45,551
Why?

538
00:36:50,621 --> 00:36:52,951
The artists at Antenna...

539
00:36:53,021 --> 00:36:55,651
never took a music lesson in their lives.

540
00:36:56,121 --> 00:36:59,921
That is why I believe Hyun Jin can become Antenna's future.

541
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:02,361
Thank you.

542
00:37:03,491 --> 00:37:04,591
Thank you.

543
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:06,121
Hyun Jin.

544
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:08,451
Let's think about this.

545
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:10,791
You are 11 years old...

546
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:12,821
and Jong Seob is 10.

547
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:15,751
The next round is a team challenge.

548
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:20,791
Imagine one rapping, the other singing...

549
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:22,861
and both of them dancing at the same time.

550
00:37:24,221 --> 00:37:25,291
That would be awesome.

551
00:37:29,451 --> 00:37:30,451
That would be...

552
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:32,321
I'm just so...

553
00:37:32,321 --> 00:37:33,721
(What combination will they bring?)

554
00:37:33,721 --> 00:37:36,321
I really think this is your year.

555
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,821
He's good.

556
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,591
Thank you.

557
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,521
(Hyun Jin was lauded as the future of K-pop.)

558
00:37:45,251 --> 00:37:50,821
(Will he be able to survive the intense competition?)

559
00:37:52,251 --> 00:37:54,691
Hello, I'm from Incheon.

560
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:56,621
I'm 12 and my name is Hong Jung Min.

561
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:58,921
- Hello. - Her eyes are so clear.

562
00:37:58,921 --> 00:37:59,951
Just look at...

563
00:37:59,951 --> 00:38:01,191
Her eyes sparkle.

564
00:38:01,251 --> 00:38:04,151
- Try to perform with confidence. - Okay.

565
00:38:04,151 --> 00:38:05,521
(Will she give a great performance like last time?)

566
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:11,691
("Marry You" by Bruno Mars)

567
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:10,191
Thank you.

568
00:39:11,791 --> 00:39:13,951
(She receives a storm of applause.)

569
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,921
- You sing very well. - Thank you.

570
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:18,121
Aside from everything else, you know how to sing.

571
00:39:19,251 --> 00:39:21,221
I think you have a lot of potential.

572
00:39:21,651 --> 00:39:24,521
As the viewers were watching her singing on TV,

573
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:26,191
they must've thought the song is easy to sing.

574
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:28,721
But in fact, this song is very difficult to sing.

575
00:39:28,721 --> 00:39:31,021
It's shocking how effortlessly she can sing it.

576
00:39:31,991 --> 00:39:33,121
She's unbelievable.

577
00:39:33,951 --> 00:39:37,091
The inside of her body is opened like a pipe.

578
00:39:37,391 --> 00:39:39,251
You can play the pipe only by blowing into it.

579
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,921
Her entire body is opened like a pipe.

580
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:45,321
Jin Young compared her to a pipe.

581
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:48,121
- You're wearing pink today, right? - Yes.

582
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:51,021
I think of her like a pink notebook.

583
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:53,021
She's like a notebook with a pink cover...

584
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:56,651
whose pages are all blank.

585
00:39:57,021 --> 00:40:01,321
I would like to fill the notebook with her from the first page.

586
00:40:01,951 --> 00:40:03,651
I have high hopes for her.

587
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:05,751
I liked your today's performance, too.

588
00:40:05,751 --> 00:40:07,221
- Good job. - Thank you.

589
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:09,921
(Jung Min is in the midst of praise.)

590
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:18,721
(Who is the last participant?)

591
00:40:21,751 --> 00:40:22,921
(Hui Yeol laughs.)

592
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,021
I'm worried about her.

593
00:40:25,091 --> 00:40:26,151
(Hyun Suk exclaims.)

594
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,251
(Han Byeol seems more nervous than last time.)

595
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:30,921
Hello.

596
00:40:31,221 --> 00:40:33,891
Hello, I'm Han Byeol from Seoul.

597
00:40:38,591 --> 00:40:39,751
(She's extremely nervous.)

598
00:40:46,551 --> 00:40:49,991
I said she is my favorite contestant.

599
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:54,361
I promised that I'll help her make it to the top 20.

600
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:58,521
I believe everyone will understand why when they see her performance.

601
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:00,361
Are you nervous?

602
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:01,551
Yes.

603
00:41:06,251 --> 00:41:08,391
Byeol, you need to relax yourself.

604
00:41:08,651 --> 00:41:11,121
- Or else, you won't do well, right? - Yes.

605
00:41:14,491 --> 00:41:16,621
(It's 10 days earlier at the in-depth audition venue.)

606
00:41:19,591 --> 00:41:21,721
- Hi, everyone. - Hello.

607
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,391
(Jin Young and Hyun Suk enter the room.)

608
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:28,391
- This room is more colorful. - Exactly.

609
00:41:31,621 --> 00:41:32,991
Congratulations on passing the first round.

610
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,861
They look even younger in here.

611
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:43,021
(They start the in-depth audition with the youngest Ga Do.)

612
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:49,421
(Her jaw drops.)

613
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:57,151
(Byeol is intimidated by Ga Do.)

614
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:03,721
(She looks more and more worried as the audition goes on.)

615
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,021
(She's impressed.)

616
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:14,151
(She becomes more nervous.)

617
00:42:15,821 --> 00:42:17,151
- Next up is Byeol. - Me?

618
00:42:19,451 --> 00:42:20,921
(Me?)

619
00:42:21,091 --> 00:42:22,191
It's Byeol's turn.

620
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,251
(She stands before the judges feeling daunted.)

621
00:42:30,121 --> 00:42:32,391
- Is your face always that red? - No.

622
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:33,791
- Are you embarrassed now? - Yes.

623
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,521
(How did you feel at the in-depth audition?)

624
00:42:35,521 --> 00:42:37,921
I was afraid and nervous.

625
00:42:38,651 --> 00:42:40,021
Why were you afraid?

626
00:42:40,921 --> 00:42:42,491
The judges were too close to me.

627
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:47,691
Did their facial expressions scare you?

628
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:50,021
- Like this. - Did Jin Young...

629
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:51,191
(They made this face.)

630
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:53,551
Like this.

631
00:42:54,821 --> 00:42:56,861
Is that how they looked at you?

632
00:42:57,421 --> 00:42:58,451
Yes.

633
00:43:01,321 --> 00:43:03,421
(She performs feeling intimidated.)

634
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:05,521
Can you dance to another song? What's wrong?

635
00:43:05,521 --> 00:43:06,551
Okay.

636
00:43:07,021 --> 00:43:09,291
Can you dance to another song? What's wrong?

637
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:10,521
My stomach hurts.

638
00:43:10,861 --> 00:43:12,491
I think she's too nervous today.

639
00:43:13,721 --> 00:43:15,191
What's the matter with you today?

640
00:43:15,991 --> 00:43:19,391
You shouldn't feel nervous in such a situation like this to be a star.

641
00:43:20,251 --> 00:43:21,451
You dance much better than this.

642
00:43:22,421 --> 00:43:24,361
I fell in love with you last time.

643
00:43:24,921 --> 00:43:26,621
You are too nervous today.

644
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:29,591
How are you feeling today?

645
00:43:31,521 --> 00:43:33,721
I'm under a lot of pressure,

646
00:43:34,491 --> 00:43:36,321
but I think I can do this.

647
00:43:38,391 --> 00:43:39,721
I don't know.

648
00:43:45,291 --> 00:43:47,491
Shake your body like this and loosen up.

649
00:43:47,551 --> 00:43:49,351
Smile and just relax.

650
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:52,121
- You need to enjoy performing. - Okay.

651
00:43:52,121 --> 00:43:53,851
- Try to enjoy it. - Okay.

652
00:43:54,151 --> 00:43:55,291
Don't be afraid.

653
00:43:55,291 --> 00:43:56,391
Okay, let's do it.

654
00:44:03,021 --> 00:44:04,521
- She's adorable. - She looks like a lead actress.

655
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:06,391
- She's so cute. - Indeed.

656
00:44:07,751 --> 00:44:10,821
(Will she able to overcome her nervousness and perform well?)

657
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:19,551
("Lullaby of Birdland" by Nikki Yanofsky)

658
00:45:24,591 --> 00:45:27,421
(It's hard to read the judges' faces.)

659
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:31,691
Let's watch her dance.

660
00:45:32,721 --> 00:45:33,851
We'll watch you dance now.

661
00:45:35,351 --> 00:45:36,721
(It's time to show her dance moves.)

662
00:45:44,391 --> 00:45:46,151
- Look at her pose. - Goodness.

663
00:45:47,351 --> 00:45:48,821
She already impressed me with her pose.

664
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:52,821
She looks gorgeous.

665
00:47:48,091 --> 00:47:49,321
(Hyun Suk exclaims.)

666
00:47:49,321 --> 00:47:50,351
(Jin Young shrieks with joy.)

667
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:55,451
(A big round of applause fills the studio.)

668
00:48:03,551 --> 00:48:05,921
She's good at expressing emotions.

669
00:48:05,921 --> 00:48:07,821
She's really good at it.

670
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:13,121
- What will she become? - Exactly.

671
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:14,791
I wonder that, too.

672
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,721
She's unbelievable.

673
00:48:19,451 --> 00:48:23,221
When a young contestant comes up with a musical instrument...

674
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:26,321
and performs amazingly, I get really surprised.

675
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:29,151
While I was watching you dance, I felt...

676
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,521
as if you were creating...

677
00:48:31,521 --> 00:48:33,551
amazing music through your dance...

678
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:38,151
except that you didn't have a musical instrument.

679
00:48:39,191 --> 00:48:41,391
That's such a great talent.

680
00:48:42,021 --> 00:48:43,651
Aside from everything else...

681
00:48:43,951 --> 00:48:46,791
Since I'm not an expert, I don't know much about the techniques,

682
00:48:46,791 --> 00:48:49,551
but your facial expressions...

683
00:48:50,121 --> 00:48:53,521
and the vibe you exuded were...

684
00:48:53,921 --> 00:48:57,351
were very natural. You're good at expressing emotions.

685
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,351
Thank you.

686
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:00,721
I can't believe my own eyes.

687
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:02,551
Good job.

688
00:49:02,551 --> 00:49:03,751
Thank you.

689
00:49:09,521 --> 00:49:12,521
(Hui Yeol is in the midst of praise.)

690
00:49:12,521 --> 00:49:15,151
(How will Jin Young evaluate her performance?)

691
00:49:16,091 --> 00:49:18,621
She is a descendant of two different lineages...

692
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:22,751
that stand out the most in the pop music industry across the world.

693
00:49:23,121 --> 00:49:25,521
She's half Swedish and half Korean.

694
00:49:25,521 --> 00:49:28,191
ABBA might be the only Swedish musician people think of,

695
00:49:28,191 --> 00:49:31,151
but there are many other famous Swedish musicians.

696
00:49:31,321 --> 00:49:33,851
They're the best when it comes to EDM.

697
00:49:33,851 --> 00:49:35,251
There are many great hip hop artists, too.

698
00:49:35,251 --> 00:49:37,021
- That's right. - Right.

699
00:49:37,821 --> 00:49:41,351
Probably because she's a descendant of the two great lineages,

700
00:49:43,151 --> 00:49:47,251
I can't criticize her techniques or strengths and weaknesses.

701
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,151
Thank you.

702
00:49:49,151 --> 00:49:50,191
Even before...

703
00:49:51,591 --> 00:49:54,391
she started dancing,

704
00:49:55,091 --> 00:49:57,221
she impressed me by her pose.

705
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:01,821
(The audience members exclaim.)

706
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:08,521
She didn't even start to dance.

707
00:50:09,391 --> 00:50:10,651
Seriously...

708
00:50:12,121 --> 00:50:15,351
Sadly, you need a natural-born talent to become an artist.

709
00:50:15,351 --> 00:50:16,951
That is absolutely true.

710
00:50:19,791 --> 00:50:22,091
I think there is a strong possibility...

711
00:50:22,821 --> 00:50:26,451
that she will become a great star like Beyonce.

712
00:50:26,591 --> 00:50:28,321
- Thank you. - As for your song,

713
00:50:28,491 --> 00:50:30,391
you chose a difficult song for you.

714
00:50:33,451 --> 00:50:36,191
When the notes in the melody ascend and descend with large leaps,

715
00:50:36,191 --> 00:50:37,951
it's hard to sing in tune.

716
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,521
The song that you just sang, there are large space...

717
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:43,351
between the notes in the melody.

718
00:50:43,351 --> 00:50:45,951
It's a hard song even for professional singers to sing,

719
00:50:45,951 --> 00:50:48,691
and you are only 10 years old.

720
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:51,221
Your pitch was very unstable. Other than that,

721
00:50:51,391 --> 00:50:54,451
it was good that you sang the song in your own style.

722
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:56,551
You also dance in your own style.

723
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,921
That's the most shocking thing about you.

724
00:51:00,251 --> 00:51:01,591
(He hesitates.)

725
00:51:01,721 --> 00:51:02,721
Also...

726
00:51:06,751 --> 00:51:08,491
(He's so touched that he's lost for words.)

727
00:51:08,491 --> 00:51:11,191
What should I say? I have so many things I want to say.

728
00:51:11,591 --> 00:51:14,251
Hyun Suk, please go ahead. I'll continue when I remember.

729
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:18,421
I just want to say...

730
00:51:19,791 --> 00:51:22,551
I'm mesmerized and fascinated by her.

731
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:29,021
Since I didn't know this song,

732
00:51:29,021 --> 00:51:31,021
I asked the other judges if they knew the song.

733
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:33,851
None of them did. You chose a very difficult song.

734
00:51:34,021 --> 00:51:35,991
- You speak Korean well, right? - Yes.

735
00:51:35,991 --> 00:51:39,151
You sang Mehgan Trainor's song in the first round, right?

736
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:42,191
- No, I didn't. - What song did you sing last time?

737
00:51:42,191 --> 00:51:43,321
She sang Mehgan Trainor's song.

738
00:51:43,321 --> 00:51:46,321
Right. You sang Mehgan Trainor's song in the first round, right?

739
00:51:47,351 --> 00:51:48,751
Mehgan Trainor.

740
00:51:49,151 --> 00:51:50,291
Oh, that's right.

741
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:52,491
Mehgan Trainor.

742
00:51:53,021 --> 00:51:54,221
Oh, that's right.

743
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:03,351
If you join YG Entertainment, it'd be hard to communicate with him.

744
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:05,121
You see what I'm saying, right?

745
00:52:05,421 --> 00:52:07,621
Would it be good or bad if it's hard to communicate with him?

746
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:11,121
It wouldn't be good, right?

747
00:52:11,121 --> 00:52:12,191
Right.

748
00:52:17,621 --> 00:52:19,521
You danced to Janet Jackson's song.

749
00:52:20,691 --> 00:52:21,791
That's right.

750
00:52:21,791 --> 00:52:23,691
It's Janet. This is how to pronounce her name.

751
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:25,391
You should pronounce it correctly.

752
00:52:28,421 --> 00:52:31,251
I watched each and every dance move...

753
00:52:31,421 --> 00:52:34,151
from the beginning to the end.

754
00:52:36,821 --> 00:52:38,221
I really liked your dance.

755
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,291
- You did a great job. - Thank you.

756
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,421
Thank you for your performance.

757
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:41,491
How adorable.

758
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,851
(All the contestants' performances are over.)

759
00:52:42,851 --> 00:52:44,151
That was funny.

760
00:52:47,751 --> 00:52:50,351
We will discuss now.

761
00:52:50,351 --> 00:52:52,891
Please wait for a short while.

762
00:52:53,891 --> 00:52:56,151
(All the contestants in the children group finished their performances.)

763
00:52:56,151 --> 00:52:59,821
(The judges are discussing to rank their performances.)

764
00:53:01,521 --> 00:53:06,851
(All five of them were acknowledged for their talents.)

765
00:53:09,221 --> 00:53:13,821
(It was a neck to neck competition. What will be the result?)

766
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:16,521
All right.

767
00:53:17,091 --> 00:53:20,391
So many contestants in this group received a lot of praise.

768
00:53:20,391 --> 00:53:22,621
It was hard to make a decision.

769
00:53:22,621 --> 00:53:26,921
But we have to follow the rules. So we've ranked your performances.

770
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:32,351
The contestant who did the best is...

771
00:53:33,491 --> 00:53:37,091
(Who could be the winner of the children group?)

772
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:42,521
Hyun Jin. Congratulations.

773
00:53:42,521 --> 00:53:46,991
(11-year-old Park Hyun Jin takes the first place.)

774
00:53:49,421 --> 00:53:52,921
The second best contestant is...

775
00:53:53,291 --> 00:53:56,291
(Who could be the second best?)

776
00:53:56,291 --> 00:53:57,991
Jong Seob.

777
00:53:57,991 --> 00:54:00,321
(Kim Jong Seob takes the second place.)

778
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:05,151
(Hyun Jin and Jong Seob take the 1st and 2nd places.)

779
00:54:05,151 --> 00:54:07,391
How will the two of them perform next time?

780
00:54:08,351 --> 00:54:11,991
(The two 11-year-old boys receive high expectations.)

781
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:17,021
(There are three girls left.)

782
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:20,451
The third best is Byeol.

783
00:54:20,451 --> 00:54:22,551
(Han Byeol takes the third place.)

784
00:54:25,921 --> 00:54:29,391
The 4th place goes to Ga Do, and Jung Min takes the 5th place.

785
00:54:35,221 --> 00:54:37,351
The two people at 4th and 5th places in this group...

786
00:54:37,351 --> 00:54:40,691
would take the 1st or 2nd in another group.

787
00:54:40,851 --> 00:54:43,521
(Will the two of them make it to the next round?)

788
00:54:43,521 --> 00:54:46,021
We've never seen any young children who did as well as they did.

789
00:54:46,021 --> 00:54:48,251
- This is the first time. - Exactly.

790
00:54:48,821 --> 00:54:50,651
I will announce the result with joy.

791
00:54:50,951 --> 00:54:52,691
All of you are qualified for the next round.

792
00:54:53,021 --> 00:54:59,021
(All five contestants make it to the next round.)

793
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,551
- Thank you. - Thank you.

794
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:04,351
Good luck. We'll see you in the next round.

795
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,251
You all did a great job.

796
00:55:06,451 --> 00:55:08,691
- Thank you. - Thank you.

797
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:13,791
(No one in the group got eliminated.)

798
00:55:13,791 --> 00:55:15,621
(Well done.)

799
00:55:15,921 --> 00:55:17,821
- This has never happened. - That's right.

800
00:55:17,821 --> 00:55:19,851
Only one in the group made it to the next round, right?

801
00:55:19,851 --> 00:55:21,451
Especially the young children didn't make it very far.

802
00:55:21,621 --> 00:55:23,491
I had a thought.

803
00:55:24,291 --> 00:55:26,621
I wondered how much money...

804
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:29,121
their performances would have been worth.

805
00:55:29,991 --> 00:55:33,451
If you think of the added value after they become stars,

806
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:36,091
how much would their performance have been worth?

807
00:55:36,091 --> 00:55:38,221
You're the true slave of capitalism.

808
00:55:41,491 --> 00:55:45,451
(Many contestants who are older than them cried while passing here.)

809
00:55:47,351 --> 00:55:51,951
(They're smiling while leaving the studio.)

810
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:56,821
(They share the joy with their families.)

811
00:55:56,921 --> 00:56:00,521
(They were serious on stage,)

812
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:02,491
(but they act their ages in front of their families.)

813
00:56:02,491 --> 00:56:03,991
- She is shy. - Is that so?

814
00:56:05,021 --> 00:56:06,691
- Give her a hug. - Give Ga Do a hug.

815
00:56:10,191 --> 00:56:12,351
- Go, Tiny Bullet! - Go, Tiny Bullet!

816
00:56:18,091 --> 00:56:20,351
Did we really see this contestant in the first round?

817
00:56:20,751 --> 00:56:22,251
How can you sing so effortlessly?

818
00:56:22,251 --> 00:56:23,691
It's game over.

819
00:56:23,691 --> 00:56:25,321
I think this contestant might win this competition.

820
00:56:25,851 --> 00:56:27,991
This is a team challenge. It's "Survival Match".

821
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:29,751
This group's match will be intense.

822
00:56:30,921 --> 00:56:33,021
I feel like I'm going crazy.

823
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,591
They are strong competitors.

824
00:56:35,951 --> 00:56:37,691
This is how a girl group should be.

825
00:56:37,751 --> 00:56:39,121
It's hard to make a decision.

826
00:56:39,121 --> 00:56:40,351
This is a big twist.

827
00:56:40,551 --> 00:56:43,551
The team to make it to the next round is...

828
00:56:44,421 --> 00:56:46,851
(K-Pop Star 6)
