1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,901
<i>Previously, on "Preacher."</i>

2
00:00:02,143 --> 00:00:03,536
_

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:04,540
I don't hate you.

4
00:00:04,605 --> 00:00:06,299
Odin Quincannon, this is Gary Cutler,

5
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,300
President of the bank.

6
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,874
<i>Oh!</i>

7
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:09,575
<i>Ahh!</i>

8
00:00:09,677 --> 00:00:10,842
<i>Ahh!!</i>

9
00:00:12,146 --> 00:00:13,445
Are we going steady now?

10
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:14,547
Even better!

11
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:18,317
Where is he?

12
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:20,418
<i>You are in possession...</i>

13
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,754
of an enormous power.

14
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:23,855
<i>We need it back!</i>

15
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,625
Where, exactly, are you guys from?

16
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:28,696
We're from Heaven.

17
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:33,631
No, no, no, no,
no, you don't understand.

18
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,633
What's inside of you, it isn't God.

19
00:00:38,103 --> 00:00:39,503
It isn't God?

20
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:40,837
No.

21
00:00:42,508 --> 00:00:43,508
What is it, then?

22
00:00:43,542 --> 00:00:44,508
It's a mistake.

23
00:00:44,543 --> 00:00:45,609
What's that mean?

24
00:00:45,644 --> 00:00:47,210
None of your business.

25
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:50,747
Just give it back.

26
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,182
Back into the coffee can?

27
00:00:52,217 --> 00:00:53,949
That's right. The domicile.

28
00:00:55,553 --> 00:00:57,687
Take care, preacher. See you Sunday.

29
00:00:57,722 --> 00:01:00,356
Oi, oi. You listenin'?

30
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:03,025
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on here.

31
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,259
We told you what's going on.

32
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:05,994
No, you have not.

33
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,531
Not much, anyway.

34
00:01:08,566 --> 00:01:09,566
What is it?

35
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,034
If it isn't God, tell me what it is.

36
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:16,471
Like we said, it's none of your business.

37
00:01:16,506 --> 00:01:18,105
I could make you tell me.

38
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:19,474
Well, don't.

39
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:20,687
You mustn't use it. Do you understand?

40
00:01:20,711 --> 00:01:22,310
Never, under any circumstances.

41
00:01:22,346 --> 00:01:24,212
Tell me what it is.

42
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,182
It's called Genesis.

43
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:32,586
Genesis.

44
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:35,357
What is that?

45
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:37,123
Deblanc.

46
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:40,627
It began with Heaven and Hell.

47
00:01:40,663 --> 00:01:43,163
Two armies fighting, two sides hating

48
00:01:43,198 --> 00:01:45,297
for as long as we can remember.

49
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,399
Heaven and Hell?

50
00:01:46,434 --> 00:01:50,035
That's right. The Endless War.

51
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:53,038
One day... thought to be impossible...

52
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:55,875
but somehow, a soldier from one side

53
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:59,746
and one from the other became
drawn to each other.

54
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:01,580
Here you go. Can I get you some coffee?

55
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:04,883
An angel and a demon... fell in love?

56
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,184
Traitors.

57
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,187
Strictly forbidden. They didn't care.

58
00:02:09,222 --> 00:02:11,256
Snuck off.

59
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,693
Met in secret and conjoined.

60
00:02:14,728 --> 00:02:16,928
Disgusting.

61
00:02:16,963 --> 00:02:19,329
Traitors.

62
00:02:19,365 --> 00:02:21,866
And then after a time, Genesis,

63
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,334
a thing never meant to be...

64
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:27,237
ya know.

65
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,139
Came to be.

66
00:02:31,811 --> 00:02:36,379
So, you're saying this Genesis

67
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:38,281
is some sort of...

68
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:44,253
angel/demon baby?

69
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,055
If by "baby," you mean

70
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,591
the most powerful entity ever known,

71
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,960
the singular force that
could shift the balance of power,

72
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:52,528
threaten all of creation,

73
00:02:52,563 --> 00:02:55,263
then, yeah, it's a baby.

74
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:04,740
Now do you understand
why we need it back?

75
00:03:06,143 --> 00:03:07,643
Okay, so...

76
00:03:07,678 --> 00:03:09,395
Seraphim.

77
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,646
Going for her phone.

78
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,681
We'll be right back.

79
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:24,091
Excuse me. Excuse me.

80
00:03:24,126 --> 00:03:25,660
Sorry.

81
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:27,093
Hello.

82
00:03:30,532 --> 00:03:33,467
Don't fool us.

83
00:03:33,502 --> 00:03:36,570
We just need one more day.

84
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,137
You got a phone in there?!

85
00:03:38,173 --> 00:03:39,940
Yeah, we're not messing about.

86
00:03:47,114 --> 00:03:49,014
Hey! Hey!

87
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:54,119
You all right, ma'am?

88
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,126
No. Let go.

89
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,071
See her?

90
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,274
Not yet.

91
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:20,844
Okay, body in the car.

92
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:26,984
Wait! Wha-What's goin' on here?

93
00:04:29,187 --> 00:04:30,353
Get her phone.

94
00:04:30,389 --> 00:04:32,656
Guys! Guys!

95
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:37,159
What the hell just happened?

96
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:40,563
Time to go. Come on.

97
00:04:40,598 --> 00:04:42,832
Go where? We... You just killed her.

98
00:04:42,867 --> 00:04:45,200
- No, we didn't.
- I left my car keys inside.

99
00:04:45,236 --> 00:04:46,702
What?

100
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:49,338
Yes, you did. There's a
dead woman right there!

101
00:04:53,577 --> 00:04:55,977
Do you have your car keys?

102
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:18,398
What the hell was that?

103
00:05:18,434 --> 00:05:21,001
It was one of the Seraphim,
Angels of the First Order.

104
00:05:21,037 --> 00:05:22,937
Angels?

105
00:05:22,972 --> 00:05:25,005
Seriously? What's it want?

106
00:05:25,041 --> 00:05:28,507
What all Seraphim want, order
and control. "Peace."

107
00:05:28,543 --> 00:05:29,703
How'd it come back like that?

108
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:31,010
It's called reinvigoration.

109
00:05:31,046 --> 00:05:32,222
Lubbock's the nearest phone for us.

110
00:05:32,246 --> 00:05:33,846
We've got two, maybe three hours.

111
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,726
Lubbock? There's phones a
lot closer than Lubbock.

112
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,117
Not like this. This one's a direct line.

113
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:39,886
Direct line to what?

114
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:43,789
Wait... you're saying
if I picked up that phone

115
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:45,757
in my hand right
now, I could call Heaven?

116
00:05:45,793 --> 00:05:47,225
No. You couldn't.

117
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,226
Why not?

118
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,762
You need angel hands.

119
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:53,364
God damn.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Angels.

121
00:06:00,506 --> 00:06:02,239
Someone left their keys.

122
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:04,775
Eh, just leave 'em there.

123
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:43,838
_

124
00:06:44,181 --> 00:06:46,915
But if you're an
angel, and she is an angel...

125
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:49,417
There are rules for
coming down here to Earth.

126
00:06:49,453 --> 00:06:51,052
We don't have permission.

127
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:56,490
We don't have much time
before she calls in reinforcements.

128
00:06:56,526 --> 00:06:57,870
Right now, they're just looking for us,

129
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:59,927
but if they find Genesis, too...

130
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:02,429
I'll just use it.

131
00:07:02,465 --> 00:07:04,465
- What?
- I have the power.

132
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,934
Worked on you, right? It'll work on...

133
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,501
Genesis isn't a power.

134
00:07:08,537 --> 00:07:12,005
It's a scandal, embarrassment
to both sides.

135
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,041
An agreement was made...

136
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,678
What is that?

137
00:07:17,713 --> 00:07:20,947
That's just Annville.

138
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:24,617
An agreement was made
at the highest levels.

139
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:27,319
Genesis must remain a secret.

140
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:29,066
The other angels and
demons find out about it,

141
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,355
they'll want it for themselves.

142
00:07:30,391 --> 00:07:31,891
It's not for you...

143
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:34,126
or anyone else to have or use.

144
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,528
Do you understand?

145
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,866
It was our first time.

146
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:43,201
We didn't know what we'd need.

147
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:44,969
How's it work?

148
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,805
How do you get Genesis to come out?

149
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,206
I sing to it.

150
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:49,808
Or...

151
00:07:49,843 --> 00:07:52,177
I'll sing to it. It will come.

152
00:08:10,863 --> 00:08:12,596
Probably just the towels.

153
00:08:20,538 --> 00:08:21,570
It's not.

154
00:08:25,643 --> 00:08:27,877
Here's a phone.

155
00:08:27,912 --> 00:08:30,046
See?

156
00:08:30,081 --> 00:08:32,648
Told him don't got to go to Lubbock.

157
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:36,051
Go ahead.

158
00:08:37,888 --> 00:08:39,587
Make your call.

159
00:08:44,327 --> 00:08:47,362
Now, dialing only takes a second,

160
00:08:47,397 --> 00:08:49,930
but you're gonna have to look away.

161
00:09:10,685 --> 00:09:11,685
Ugh!

162
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,372
Don't!

163
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,113
You dying?

164
00:09:42,148 --> 00:09:43,148
No.

165
00:09:44,984 --> 00:09:46,150
What the hell?!

166
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,621
If we don't die, we can't come back.

167
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,493
Watch out. She'll be back.

168
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,433
How do you do that?

169
00:10:03,468 --> 00:10:05,068
Just happens.

170
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,139
What's it feel like?

171
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:11,708
Don't feel like anything.
We just come back.

172
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:15,711
Sometimes immediately in
the exact same place.

173
00:10:15,746 --> 00:10:16,812
Other times...

174
00:10:16,848 --> 00:10:19,215
Shh. Shh.

175

176
00:10:25,356 --> 00:10:26,989
Oh!

177
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:30,659
Ugh!

178
00:10:30,694 --> 00:10:33,194
My dentist.

179

180
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,999
Restrain it.

181
00:10:38,034 --> 00:10:40,235
Restrain it?

182
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,103
- How do we...
- Shh!

183
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,039
Ugh!

184

185
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,755

186
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,258
Damn.

187
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:08,660

Stab her gently.

194
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:38,890
I said stab her gently
you... Fiore, don't.

195
00:11:38,926 --> 00:11:40,090

196

Oh, Jaysis, what'd you do?

212

Ugh.

214
00:13:52,169 --> 00:13:54,403
We need Genesis back now.

215
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:57,339
Genesis? What? Like the bloody band?

216
00:13:57,374 --> 00:13:59,341
That's a terrible name.

217
00:13:59,376 --> 00:14:02,476
- Back into hiding?
- Correct.

218

You're what... Genesis' jailers?

219
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,582
No, no. We're its custodians.

220
00:14:08,618 --> 00:14:10,484
We take care of it.

221
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,719
You let it get away.

222
00:14:13,556 --> 00:14:15,589
It escaped.

224
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,225
We dunno.

Why me?

226
00:14:24,065 --> 00:14:25,198
Why did it choose me?

227
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:26,800
We don't know that, either.

228

I'm sorry.

I'm keeping it.

231
00:14:39,747 --> 00:14:40,979
What?

232
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,715
You can't keep it.

233
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,450
I think I have to.

234
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,884
Listen, please, we need it back.

235
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,353
We'll give you anything you want.

236
00:14:47,388 --> 00:14:49,388
I have what I want...

237
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,056
What God wants.

238
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:52,657
God does not want this.

239
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,626
How do you know? Like you
said, you're just custodians.

240
00:14:55,662 --> 00:14:59,964
And you're just a
person... a sinful human being.

241
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:02,533
True.

242
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:06,237
So if I'm wrong and
God wants Genesis back...

243
00:15:06,272 --> 00:15:08,672
he can come and take it.

244
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,841
Till then, I've still got a job to do.

You're not letting me do anything.

251

Unwelcome, unforeseen consequences.

That's my tulip.

339
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:32,622
Oh. It's lovely.

340
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,660
What are you gonna do, man?

341
00:22:36,695 --> 00:22:39,029
- About what?
- About Genesis.

342
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:40,964
Honestly, I mean, what a terrible name.

343
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,065
It's just awful.

344
00:22:42,101 --> 00:22:44,968
I'm keeping it, like I said.

345
00:22:45,004 --> 00:22:47,304
I dunno, Padre.

346
00:22:47,339 --> 00:22:48,659
Now, those fellers might not seem

347
00:22:48,673 --> 00:22:50,139
the sharpest shivs in Heaven's shed,

348
00:22:50,175 --> 00:22:51,786
but still, I mean, you
said they were bloody angels.

349
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:52,909
Yeah, and?

350
00:22:52,944 --> 00:22:54,410
And I don't know how it works,

351
00:22:54,445 --> 00:22:56,612
but don't... I don't know...
don't they outrank you?

352
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:58,414
Don't you kind of
have to listen to them?

353
00:22:58,449 --> 00:23:01,284
I don't have to
listen to anyone but God.

354
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,553
Oh. Forgot about his
plan for you and all that.

355
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:07,655
You still doubt that?

356
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,757
After everything that's happened?

357
00:23:09,793 --> 00:23:11,893
I doubt everything all
the time, all right?

358
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:13,328
It's the only way to live.

359
00:23:13,363 --> 00:23:14,908
Well, that's where you
and I part company.

360
00:23:14,932 --> 00:23:16,929
Now look, I'm just
sayin', if it was up to me,

361
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,977
I wouldn't be messin' about with it.

362
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:20,268
Well, it's not up to
you, Cassidy. It's up to me.

363
00:23:23,806 --> 00:23:26,106
All right.

364
00:23:26,142 --> 00:23:27,774
All right, so what are you gonna do?

365
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,109
Come on.

366
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,181
Same as before.

367
00:23:34,217 --> 00:23:37,751
Nothing's changed.

368
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,831
There's a still a lot more
goin' on 'round here needs doin'.

369
00:23:39,855 --> 00:23:42,488
Like what? More what?

370
00:23:44,692 --> 00:23:46,425
More.

371
00:24:00,552 --> 00:24:03,184
Hey, Eugene. Can we sit here?

372
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:06,286
_

373
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:08,714
_

374
00:24:09,627 --> 00:24:11,560
Come on. He's okay.

375
00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:16,931
I got the chicken fingers here.

376
00:24:18,235 --> 00:24:19,833
You can't just crap on people.

377
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:21,402
I don't care who you are.

378
00:24:21,437 --> 00:24:23,036
Wow.

379
00:24:23,072 --> 00:24:25,839
Elizabeth Taylor... you
really slashed her tires?

380
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:28,709
Mm, I punctured one with a wine opener.

381
00:24:29,912 --> 00:24:31,879
Pretty nice lady, actually.

382
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:34,682
Just a super-shitty tipper.

383
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:38,385
Los Angeles and Hollywood... that's cool.

384
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,888
Well... they're pretty
much the same place.

385
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,892
Oh, I-I... I know.

386
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:47,694
Right? Of course.

387
00:24:49,298 --> 00:24:51,030
L.A.'s stupid.

388
00:24:51,065 --> 00:24:52,365
We weren't there long.

389
00:24:52,401 --> 00:24:55,066
Ran around the southwest, mostly...

390
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:58,136
New Mexico, Arizona... Texas, of course.

391
00:24:58,172 --> 00:24:59,638
In the end, Dallas.

392
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:01,106
We were all over the place.

393
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,344
- Mommy!
- Excuse me.

394
00:25:13,152 --> 00:25:16,053
- You thirsty?
- Yes.

395
00:25:16,088 --> 00:25:18,155
- Yes.
- Yes.

396
00:25:20,527 --> 00:25:21,793
Okay.

397
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:25,396
Here you go, now. Drink some water.

398
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:29,065
Your hands broken?

399
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,436
Have some more.

400
00:25:32,471 --> 00:25:34,137
Okay.

401
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:36,807
Go back to sleep.

402
00:25:37,976 --> 00:25:39,443
You'll be okay.

403
00:25:46,183 --> 00:25:49,318
Made 200. I hope it's enough.

404
00:25:49,354 --> 00:25:50,820
200 people? Really?

405
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:54,189
Imagine so... maybe more.

406
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:56,325
Can't believe Jesse's,
like, any good at it.

407
00:25:56,361 --> 00:25:59,895
Yep. No, he's all of a
sudden really popular.

408
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,167
Can I ask you something about him?

409
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:07,168
Sure.

410
00:26:07,203 --> 00:26:08,803
Mommy!
- What?!

411
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:11,272
God. Driving me crazy.

412
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:12,774
Sorry.

413
00:26:12,809 --> 00:26:14,354
It's just, I have, like,
10,000 things to do

414
00:26:14,378 --> 00:26:17,178
before Sunday, and sick days just...

415
00:26:17,213 --> 00:26:19,646
Well, I can watch her...
if you got stuff to do.

416
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:22,983
Thanks. I'll be okay.

417
00:26:23,018 --> 00:26:24,385
I mean, I seriously don't mind.

418
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,654
I-I can read to her, bring
her juice... whatever.

419
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:30,557
Let her sleep.

420
00:26:30,593 --> 00:26:32,025
Yeah.

421
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:33,827
I just worry.

422
00:26:33,863 --> 00:26:37,162
Go do your thing. We'll be fine.

423
00:26:37,198 --> 00:26:38,998
Have you ever watched kids before?

424
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:41,166
I mean, do you have any experience?

425
00:26:41,202 --> 00:26:43,636
I had a kid once.

426
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:44,937
That count?

427
00:26:47,041 --> 00:26:50,543
Oh. That's, uh...

428
00:26:50,578 --> 00:26:52,011
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:52,046 --> 00:26:53,046
It's fine.

430
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,383
Of if you want, I can
take the church stuff,

431
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,318
and... you can stay here.

432
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:02,521
Whatever, if it'll help.

433
00:27:02,556 --> 00:27:04,088
Thanks.

434
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,156
That'd be great.

435
00:27:05,191 --> 00:27:07,258
Mm-hmm.

436
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:09,360
Mommy!

437
00:27:23,543 --> 00:27:25,409
Now, look, I ain't one to back down

438
00:27:25,445 --> 00:27:27,777
from losing a fight or
making a bad decision,

439
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,579
but there's asking for trouble,

440
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,481
and there's bloody beggin' for it.

441
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,851
Now, listen, even...
even to myself, right,

442
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,320
even I'm saying
this looks like a mistake.

443
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:42,124
This is why Genesis
was given me, Cassidy.

444
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,759
This is what it's for.

445
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,964
God doesn't make mistakes.

446
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:54,536
Grab the ladder.

447
00:27:54,572 --> 00:27:56,137
God may not make mistakes,

448
00:27:56,173 --> 00:27:58,239
but people are bloody famous for it!

449
00:28:06,616 --> 00:28:08,449
Ugh.

450
00:28:11,354 --> 00:28:12,820
Gowns are paid for.

451
00:28:12,856 --> 00:28:14,333
You just need to pick
'em up from the cleaners,

452
00:28:14,357 --> 00:28:16,090
and I told Javier
to expect you before 3:00.

453
00:28:16,125 --> 00:28:17,557
Mm-hmm.

454
00:28:17,593 --> 00:28:19,893
Macro Mart has
paper towels, toilet paper,

455
00:28:19,928 --> 00:28:21,227
plastic cups, paper plates.

456
00:28:21,262 --> 00:28:22,896
Don't get the flimsy ones, but don't get

457
00:28:22,931 --> 00:28:25,899
the too-firm ones, either,
'cause they're expensive.

458
00:28:25,934 --> 00:28:28,502
Candles and cleaning supplies,
you'll put in the storage closet

459
00:28:28,537 --> 00:28:29,970
with the bulletins and the wine.

460
00:28:30,005 --> 00:28:31,471
Right.

461
00:28:31,507 --> 00:28:32,984
My number's there
in case you need anything

462
00:28:33,008 --> 00:28:37,009
or anything comes up, so... questions?

463
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:39,177
Nope.

464
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:41,847
Um... what's that word?

465
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:43,782
"Ammonia."

466
00:28:43,818 --> 00:28:44,818
Hmm.

467
00:28:46,554 --> 00:28:48,521
Are you sure about
this? It's just, it's a lot,

468
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:49,822
and I can always call Miles.

469
00:28:49,857 --> 00:28:51,189
- No, I got it.
- No?

470
00:28:51,225 --> 00:28:53,190
I mean, it's just errands.

471
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:57,629
Yeah. You're right. Thanks.

472
00:29:10,342 --> 00:29:12,042
T-Testing.

473
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:13,977
One, two, three. Testing.

474
00:29:16,409 --> 00:29:19,611
Hey, Eugene? Want to
see something awesome?

475
00:29:19,646 --> 00:29:21,078
Come on!

476
00:30:29,879 --> 00:30:32,045
Spooky, huh?

477
00:30:32,738 --> 00:30:33,976

480
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,718
Check this out.

481
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:44,824
See? Awesome, right?

482
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:45,992
Wow.

483

Mr. Mayor?

498
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:16,210
Everything all right?

499
00:32:19,548 --> 00:32:23,417
I'm thinking about doing
something really wrong.

500
00:32:23,453 --> 00:32:25,619
I can't tell you what it is, but...

501
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:31,024
I just wanted to know whether
or not I should do it.

502
00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:33,393
Well...

503
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:37,530
based on what I'm hearing,
I'd probably say "No."

504
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:41,301
Well, what if doing
what's right is worse?

505
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:44,703
In a sense that it hurts more people.

506
00:32:44,738 --> 00:32:46,905
You wanna give me
a little more to go on here?

507
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:52,878
How do you know what's
the right thing to do?

508
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:54,079
You pray.

509
00:32:55,616 --> 00:32:56,882
For what?

510
00:32:56,917 --> 00:33:00,585
Direction, what's the next best action.

511
00:33:00,621 --> 00:33:04,788
How do you know it's
God... giving you the direction?

512
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:06,891
You know, not just the
voice in your own head

513
00:33:06,926 --> 00:33:08,826
telling you what you
already want to hear?

514
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,629
Miles, unless you tell
me what's wrong, I can't...

515
00:33:11,664 --> 00:33:16,100
In my head... it all
sounds the same, you know?

516
00:33:16,136 --> 00:33:18,402
God, he-he's telling me to do one thing,

517
00:33:18,437 --> 00:33:20,570
and I-I'm saying something else.

518
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:22,906
How do you know o-one
voice from the other?

519
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:24,307
It's not the same.

520
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,478
You know which is which.

521
00:33:28,514 --> 00:33:30,180
I don't know.

522
00:33:30,215 --> 00:33:32,849
They're really similar.

523
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:35,484
Either you and God are
saying the exact same thing...

524
00:33:38,289 --> 00:33:40,622
Either that or you're
not hearing God at all.

525
00:33:42,693 --> 00:33:44,293
What is that?

526
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:47,696
Emily asked me to drop some stuff off.

527
00:33:47,731 --> 00:33:49,131
What stuff?

528
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:52,133
Programs, plates, wine.

529
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:53,268
Church stuff.

530
00:34:11,187 --> 00:34:12,486
So...

531
00:34:12,521 --> 00:34:14,955
You tried to forget about me, huh?

532
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,690
You tried to put me out of your head.

533
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,626
But the craving came on so strong,

534
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:20,894
you couldn't help yourself.

535
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:22,629
You had to hunt me down like a wild...

536
00:34:22,664 --> 00:34:24,331
Wait. What are you doing here?

537
00:34:24,366 --> 00:34:25,732
I work here.

538
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:30,403
What are you doing here?

539
00:34:30,438 --> 00:34:33,206
Tulip?

540
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:34,907
Tulip?

541
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:37,876
You're his Tulip?

542
00:34:37,912 --> 00:34:40,713
Of course. I should have known that.

543
00:34:40,748 --> 00:34:43,582
So what do we do now?

544
00:34:48,222 --> 00:34:49,222
What you doing?

545
00:34:49,256 --> 00:34:50,755
Putting stuff away.

546
00:34:50,790 --> 00:34:55,927
Emily asked me to help
out, so, uh... I'm helping out.

547
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,162
Emily did?

548
00:34:57,197 --> 00:34:58,763
Mm-hmm. Been helping her all day.

549
00:34:58,798 --> 00:35:01,198
Pretty much folded
all these program things,

550
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:02,466
did a bunch of errands.

551
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:08,372
You kept this.

552
00:35:10,276 --> 00:35:14,278
No, I just... forgot to throw it out.

553
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:17,180
No, you kept it.

554
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,814
Put it back.

555
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,939
What's going on?

556
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,508
Everyone's waiting.

557
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,843
I was just about to open up.

558
00:36:09,879 --> 00:36:12,199
Eugene's outside, wants to talk
to you. Says it's important.

559
00:36:12,214 --> 00:36:13,380
I'll talk to him later.

560
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,381
Okay.

561
00:36:14,417 --> 00:36:17,050
- Hey.
- Hmm?

562
00:36:18,821 --> 00:36:21,888
This is good, right?

563
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:24,123
It's a lot of people.

564
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:26,959
Lot of people coming to get saved.

565
00:36:26,994 --> 00:36:28,327
Nothing wrong with that.

566
00:36:29,664 --> 00:36:31,597
Didn't even need to
bet your daddy's land

567
00:36:31,633 --> 00:36:33,232
or bribe 'em with a TV, neither.

568
00:36:36,337 --> 00:36:37,736
You disapprove.

569
00:36:39,473 --> 00:36:41,139
I understand.

570
00:36:41,174 --> 00:36:45,477
This is all working now, right?

571
00:36:45,512 --> 00:36:46,978
This is all good.

572
00:36:47,013 --> 00:36:49,915
Good. Yeah. It's good.

573
00:36:53,653 --> 00:36:55,419
I think so, too.

574
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:04,428
Thanks for all this, Em...

575
00:37:04,464 --> 00:37:06,163
for everything.

576
00:37:06,198 --> 00:37:08,332
You're welcome.

577
00:37:10,002 --> 00:37:13,169
You and Tulip done a
great job setting this up.

578
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:17,139
Tulip? Yeah.

579
00:37:23,648 --> 00:37:25,414
I'll send in Eugene.

580
00:37:37,862 --> 00:37:39,227
Everyone's waitin'.

581
00:37:41,966 --> 00:37:43,565
What's goin' on?

582
00:37:46,819 --> 00:37:47,869
_

583
00:37:50,956 --> 00:37:53,363
_

584
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:55,543
Take what back?

585
00:37:57,285 --> 00:37:58,576
_

586
00:38:00,381 --> 00:38:01,833
_

587
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:04,822
_

588
00:38:07,092 --> 00:38:08,675
_

589
00:38:11,426 --> 00:38:13,159
I see.

590
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:21,213
_

591
00:38:26,743 --> 00:38:28,393
_

592
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:31,154
Don't want to be forgiven?

593
00:38:31,727 --> 00:38:34,391
_

594
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:36,920
_

595
00:38:39,675 --> 00:38:41,719
- _
- Cheating?

596
00:38:45,892 --> 00:38:47,058
You know, Eugene...

597
00:38:49,029 --> 00:38:51,295
you're a hard kid to please.

598
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,198
Sometimes I wonder,

599
00:38:55,233 --> 00:38:57,634
"What's it gonna
take to make him happy?"

600
00:38:58,563 --> 00:39:00,194
_

601
00:39:00,195 --> 00:39:02,873
Do you even want to be happy?

602
00:39:02,908 --> 00:39:04,953
'Cause I'm starting to
think you got a big investment

603
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:07,444
in feeling bad all the time.

604
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:10,379
This is God's will... what I've done.

605
00:39:10,414 --> 00:39:15,618
What I've done for
you, what I'm about to do.

606
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:17,386
Understand?

607
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:20,389
It is not "cheating."

608
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:24,430
_

609
00:39:24,431 --> 00:39:26,595
I'm gonna save the damn town!

610
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:32,100
Jesus.

611
00:39:36,406 --> 00:39:37,672
Eugene.

612
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:45,079
I don't understand
why you keep coming to me.

613
00:39:45,832 --> 00:39:47,016
_

614
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,410
_

615
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,490
That's right.

616
00:39:59,595 --> 00:40:02,161
I am.

617
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:04,797
I made a promise.

618
00:40:04,833 --> 00:40:06,933
That's what this is for.

619
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:08,267
I'm gonna open those doors.

620
00:40:08,302 --> 00:40:09,736
I'm gonna make them see the light

621
00:40:09,771 --> 00:40:11,403
and fulfill my promise.

622
00:40:11,439 --> 00:40:13,305
Then I will be free.

623
00:40:16,044 --> 00:40:18,309
That's what I'm gonna do.

624
00:40:24,934 --> 00:40:26,672
_

625
00:40:26,673 --> 00:40:28,020
Oh, yes, I can.

626
00:40:28,516 --> 00:40:29,559
_

627
00:40:30,026 --> 00:40:31,846
_

628
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:34,848
Well, I'll choose for them, and
unlike you, they won't complain.

629
00:40:35,718 --> 00:40:38,010
_

630
00:40:38,011 --> 00:40:40,298
I don't need to hear someone
like you lecture me on sin.

631
00:40:40,332 --> 00:40:42,329
It's a blessing.

632
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,170
_

633
00:40:44,171 --> 00:40:45,550
- Eugene.
- _

634
00:40:45,551 --> 00:40:46,771
- _
- This is not a sin!

635
00:40:46,806 --> 00:40:49,306
- _
- Go to hell, Eugene!

636
00:41:07,325 --> 00:41:10,559
Hi, Cynthia. It's Miles
Person calling you back.

637
00:41:10,594 --> 00:41:14,396
I apologize, but something's been
going on with my voicemail.

638
00:41:14,431 --> 00:41:16,565
You know, well, o-one minute,

639
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,867
it's totally empty, and then the next...

640
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:23,038
Right, exactly. I have 30 messages.

641
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:24,074
Yep.

642
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:26,874
No, I-I-I know... annoying.

643
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:29,210
I'm sorry to call on a Sunday, uh,

644
00:41:29,245 --> 00:41:31,579
but I just got a call
myself from Highway Patrol

645
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:36,084
about 20 minutes ago to
come down here, and...

646
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:39,486
Well, officers, they off-offered
to reach out to you,

647
00:41:39,522 --> 00:41:41,488
uh, which is the usual
way of doing things,

648
00:41:41,524 --> 00:41:44,057
but, um, well, I said no.

649
00:41:44,093 --> 00:41:49,596
I wanted you and your company
to hear it from me first.

650
00:41:49,631 --> 00:41:52,232
Yeah.

651
00:41:52,267 --> 00:41:55,235
Well, you see, Cynthia,
I'm afraid there's been...

652
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:57,303
a terrible accident.
