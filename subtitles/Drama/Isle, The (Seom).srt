What is all that crap
on the windshield?

33
00:03:56,183 --> 00:03:58,166
It's ash
from the fire.

34
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:01,837
This is where
you're bringing me?

35
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,822
It's rent-free.

36
00:04:04,107 --> 00:04:06,141
Before or after
it burns down?

37
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:07,526
There's nothing
to worry about.

38
00:04:07,594 --> 00:04:11,046
The fire's way
on the other side
of the lake.

That's Al Kaiser.

There's Don Burke.

42
00:04:17,654 --> 00:04:19,688
He lives here
full-time.

43
00:04:19,756 --> 00:04:23,209
Could use a little more lift
in that jump shot.

CHARLOTTE:
Girls, go in the house.

45
00:04:25,512 --> 00:04:27,612
Fill up all the pots with water
and bring it on the front porch.

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,248
We're on it!

47
00:04:29,382 --> 00:04:31,750
It's essential we remain
calm in a crisis.

48
00:04:31,818 --> 00:04:34,169
I'd hardly call it
a crisis, Mother.

49
00:04:34,237 --> 00:04:36,422
This house has been
in my family for 83 years,

50
00:04:36,489 --> 00:04:38,857
and it's not gonna
burn up on my watch.

51
00:04:39,092 --> 00:04:42,027
It can burn up
on my watch.

52
00:04:42,094 --> 00:04:43,562
Hey, it's not that often

53
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:46,665
that you see a beautiful
woman on the roof.

54
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:49,768
Not nearly enough.

55

Mom loves this stuff.

56
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:54,923
So do I.

57
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:57,042
You're both crazy.

58
00:04:58,545 --> 00:04:59,962

you're dead!

water on Willow.

Girls, I don't want you
to play with the water.

62
00:05:18,181 --> 00:05:19,998
All right.

63
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:21,283
This is it.

64
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:23,602
Does it have
indoor plumbing?

65
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,904
It's a nice place.

66
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,506
Dog Dave wanted
to sell it,

67
00:05:27,574 --> 00:05:29,808
but I convinced him
to wait a couple months.

68
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:30,876
"Dog Dave"?

69
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,228
Yeah, he used to
have four dogs.

70
00:05:33,296 --> 00:05:36,781
There's only one left,
but the name stuck.

71
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,785
Anyway, he said
you could stay here
for the summer.

72
00:05:40,853 --> 00:05:42,720
My good fortune.

73
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:44,323
Come on,
Uncle Monte.

74
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,075
It'll be good for you.

75
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:49,812
You can spend
the whole summer relaxing,

00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:51,279
taking in the beauty.

77
00:05:52,415 --> 00:05:55,283
Nothing to do except
for look after the dog.

78
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,357
Make that nothing to do.

79
00:06:01,424 --> 00:06:03,892
Well, he'll come back
when he's hungry.

80
00:06:04,144 --> 00:06:05,460
Hopefully not.

81
00:06:05,528 --> 00:06:08,046
My mother has the blazing
inferno under control.

82
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,431
It's okay to stand down,
Mrs. O'Neil.

83
00:06:09,498 --> 00:06:11,233
The fire's
been contained.

Thanks for your
cooperation, as always.

Thank you, Captain.

Well, I'm sure
she'll be a good
firefighter someday.

MONTE:
Just leave it there.

89
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:23,761
I can do it myself.

keeping your spirits up.

Is that all right?

I need a drink.

99
00:07:15,365 --> 00:07:17,182
I'll get the typewriter.

100
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,017
Toss it in the garbage.

101
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,919
This might be
a good place to write.

102

She's a black-hearted whore,
and I'm done with her.

Aaah!

00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:51,399
What's he yelling at?

106

All righty.

What, does this

provide its patrons

with a proper glass?

00:08:44,453 --> 00:08:45,870
Why bother?

the last vestige
of propriety

remaining in my life.

120
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:59,083
And I shall,
by all accounts,

121
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:01,786
consider myself
a lost cause.

122

Well, God knows
we don't want that.

123
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,692
I stocked the pantry
for the summer,

about when you're
supposed to feed Ringo.

And who is Ringo?

That's the dog.

What kind of name
is that for a dog?

132
00:09:23,842 --> 00:09:26,578
Well, it was John, Paul,

It's Joe Viola.
We need to talk.

142
00:09:40,643 --> 00:09:44,696
All right. I confess.
I gave Joe the number.

I think you should
hear what he has to say.

And what might be the topic
of that conversation?

148
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:56,792
Nobody cares about
a writer nobody reads.

149
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,911
Nobody reads you
because you don't write.

150
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,264
Drinking is a very
demanding profession.

And I can't hold down

You have always been

Well...

when they gave it to you.

157
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:23,101
And how you brought it
to the hospital

158
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:24,453
and hung it on the wall
for her to see

She left me!

164
00:10:34,464 --> 00:10:35,497
Well, there's
more to life

165
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:37,532
than the way
you're living it.

166
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,901
Stuff your ideas
in the suggestion box

167
00:10:39,969 --> 00:10:40,735
on your way out.

168
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,438
I'll be by
to check on you.

169
00:10:43,506 --> 00:10:46,508
And when you do, you'll
find me dead by my own hand,

170
00:10:46,575 --> 00:10:49,410
a smoking Navy Colt Revolver
by my side,

171
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:50,612
and a note of farewell,

172
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,580
to no one in particular.

173
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:54,032
Sounds like a plan.

174
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:58,937
He screams a lot
'cause he's crazy.

175
00:10:59,004 --> 00:11:02,090
I seen him swallow a rat
and then puke it up.

176
00:11:02,325 --> 00:11:04,108
He likes to puke.

177
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:05,877
He sounds bulimic.

178
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:08,080
Stay outta my story.

179
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:11,033
He likes to chew on
spiders and cockroaches,

180
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,035
so he can puke his guts out
all over the floor.

181
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:16,388
But his favorite...

182
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:19,140
is big, fat, juicy worms.

183
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,226
Finn, don't scare her.

184
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:23,811
Shut up, Willow Tree.
I'm looking out
for my family.

185
00:11:24,714 --> 00:11:26,631
Whatever.
Now...

186
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:27,815
if he even looks at you,

187
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,668
you just make the sign
of the cross,

188
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:31,703
just like with vampires.

189
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,971
Perfect.

190
00:11:33,106 --> 00:11:35,157
You know what he likes
to do late at night?

191
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:36,725
What?

192
00:11:36,792 --> 00:11:39,444
He looks for an open window,
sneaks in,

193
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,880
crawls right up
to where you're sleeping,

194
00:11:42,014 --> 00:11:45,116
sticks out
his long, slimy tongue,

195
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:47,319
and licks your feet.

196
00:11:47,386 --> 00:11:48,653
Finn, stop it!

197
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,840
If you catch him licking
your feet, do not,

198
00:11:51,907 --> 00:11:55,377
I repeat,
do not open your eyes.

199
00:11:55,445 --> 00:11:57,095
If he sees that you're awake,

200
00:11:57,163 --> 00:11:59,797
he'll bite off a toe
and swallow it whole!

201
00:11:59,865 --> 00:12:01,382
CHARLOTTE:
Dinner's ready.

202
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,735
Mother, Finn's
scaring Flora again.

203
00:12:03,887 --> 00:12:06,121
She keeps making up stuff
about the man at Dog Dave's,

204
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:07,422
says he eats worms.

205
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,140
Well, maybe
he was hungry.

206
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,012
WOMAN: Poor Don.

207
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,447
MAN: Yeah, with
all that basketball,

208
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:17,065
he was in such
good shape.

209
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,652
That is why I always refrain

210
00:12:20,719 --> 00:12:23,155
from any form of exercise.

211
00:12:51,534 --> 00:12:52,551
You'll get
to see him again.

212
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:54,586
He'll visit soon.

213
00:12:54,653 --> 00:12:56,454
What's going on?

214
00:12:56,522 --> 00:12:58,289
Flora misses Daddy.

215
00:13:00,393 --> 00:13:03,762
Oh...I know, sweetie.

216
00:13:05,164 --> 00:13:08,666
This has been hard
on all of us.

217
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:10,968
But you know he's
gonna visit soon.

218
00:13:11,036 --> 00:13:14,406
Why can't you and Daddy
get married again?

219
00:13:14,473 --> 00:13:18,693
Oh...
I wish we could.

220
00:13:18,761 --> 00:13:20,561
You know, sometimes
mommies and daddies

221
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,664
just can't
be happy together.

222
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:26,618
I tried to explain
that to her, but...

223
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:29,270
Are you happy now?

224
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,807
Oh...
[laughs quietly]

225
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,644
I have my
three girls...

226
00:13:36,712 --> 00:13:40,281
and that's all
I ever want.

227
00:13:56,148 --> 00:13:58,933
Aaaah!

228
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:01,752
Mmm...

229
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,788
kindred spirit.

230
00:14:08,294 --> 00:14:09,727
Ahh...

231
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:15,050
Ah, you must be the dog.

232
00:14:15,117 --> 00:14:16,350
Be seated.

233
00:14:16,418 --> 00:14:18,336
We have some things
to discuss.

234
00:14:18,403 --> 00:14:20,105
[woof]

235
00:14:20,172 --> 00:14:23,925
Dog Dave has left
you in my care
for the summer.

236
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:26,762
Right off, we're gonna
change your name.

237
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:31,266
You are not some
rock 'n' roll icon
from Liverpool.

238
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:34,436
You're a dog, and
you shall be named
appropriately.

239
00:14:35,521 --> 00:14:38,472
You will take pride
in this name,

240
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,775
and one day,
thank me.

241
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:45,113
I shall call you...

242
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:47,131
Spot.

243
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,567
It's a good name...

244
00:14:48,634 --> 00:14:51,552
even though you
don't have spots.

245
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,921
It's not about spots,

246
00:14:52,989 --> 00:14:55,423
as you will come
to understand.

247
00:14:56,359 --> 00:14:58,376
Now,
I expect to witness

248
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:00,529
the finer side
of your character.

249
00:15:00,596 --> 00:15:03,882
If one of the local
bitches is in heat,

250
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:05,516
she will remain so,

251
00:15:05,584 --> 00:15:07,752
without any assistance
on your part

252
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,420
to alleviate
her condition.

253
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:16,244
That's generally
a good way to handle it.

254
00:15:16,312 --> 00:15:18,095
[snuffles]
Oh.

255
00:15:18,331 --> 00:15:21,198
One more thing:
no farting.

256
00:15:21,266 --> 00:15:22,434
[woof]

257
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,092
Peace and love.

258
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,528
Not now, Carl.
I've got work to do.

259
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:34,912
Me, too.

260
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:48,710
I hope you're ready
for me, Belle Isle,

261
00:15:48,777 --> 00:15:51,029
'cause I'm coming for you.

262
00:16:17,072 --> 00:16:19,341
Is this the Dollar Ride?

263
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,527
Good.

264
00:16:22,595 --> 00:16:24,763
Does your transportation
services

265
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,898
accommodate
the handicapped?

266
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:30,168
Excellent, sir,

267
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:33,972
because if you did not
accommodate the handicapped,

268
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,408
I would sue
your unaccommodating ass.

269
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,677
[music playing]

270
00:16:55,745 --> 00:16:57,478
Buenas días, señoritas.

271
00:16:57,546 --> 00:16:59,163
I don't know about you,

272
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:02,200
but this music makes me
feel like dancing.

273
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,580
Two Ding Dongs...

[cash register

275
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:20,217

[beeping]

277
00:17:23,388 --> 00:17:28,860
and a box
of gluten-free
Fruity Pebbles.

278
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,665
Will that be all?

279
00:17:33,732 --> 00:17:38,102
Uh, I'll have another
bottle of your finest
sour mash whiskey.

[beeping]

That will be $37.42.

283
00:17:49,898 --> 00:17:51,416
Take it out of that.

284
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:54,502
So, it's Mahmoud,
is it?

285
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,037
Yes, sir.

286
00:17:56,104 --> 00:17:58,239
Here is your change.

287
00:17:58,307 --> 00:17:59,908
Uh-oh.

288
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:01,826
What?

289
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:05,329
Classic check-out stand
blunder.

290
00:18:05,397 --> 00:18:06,648
What is?

291
00:18:06,715 --> 00:18:09,033
In a word,
Slim Jims.

292
00:18:09,101 --> 00:18:13,054
Isn't that...
two words?

293
00:18:13,122 --> 00:18:16,273
You're taking your eye
off the ball, Mahmoud.

294
00:18:16,341 --> 00:18:18,293
What ball?

295
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:22,880
I realize that it is
considered by many

296
00:18:22,948 --> 00:18:26,050
to be an on-the-way-out
kind of item,

297
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:29,721
but I believe that
to be a rural myth.

298
00:18:29,788 --> 00:18:31,956
Don't get me wrong.

299
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,691
If you have a hankering
for Slim Jims,

300
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:34,926
you'll hunt the store over,

301
00:18:34,993 --> 00:18:36,711
but if not,

302
00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:38,579
a desperate display
like this

303
00:18:38,647 --> 00:18:40,815
improves no one's life.

304
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,334
What do you suggest?

305
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:44,635
Sunflower seeds.

306
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:46,754
Just a thought.

307
00:18:46,989 --> 00:18:49,690
Good day.
Good day.

CHARLOTTE:
Come on.

309
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,897
You're
such a good boy.

310
00:18:58,633 --> 00:18:59,567
Hi.

311
00:19:00,902 --> 00:19:02,570
We haven't formally met.

312
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:04,105
I'm Charlotte O'Neil.

313
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:07,959
Pleasure, Mrs. O'Neil.
Monte Wildhorn.

314
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:11,796
I should explain. I have
a rather long-standing
arrangement with Dave,

315
00:19:12,098 --> 00:19:14,149
since he's away
a lot with his band.

316
00:19:14,216 --> 00:19:17,485
And, while he's gone,
I take care of Ringo.

317
00:19:17,552 --> 00:19:20,905
You're not, by any chance,
referring to Spot, are you?

318
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:24,291
Oh, a new name?

319
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,093
Well, I've known him
since he was a pup.

320
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:27,545
Well, there's a lot
to be said

321
00:19:27,612 --> 00:19:30,014
for enduring
associations,
Mrs. O'Neil,

322
00:19:30,082 --> 00:19:31,515
but in the future,

323
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,585
I'd appreciate it
if you wouldn't walk
my dog.

324
00:19:34,653 --> 00:19:35,920
He's Dave's dog.

325
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,856
I'm not claiming to be
his biological father.

326
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:41,993
Oh... um...

327
00:19:42,061 --> 00:19:44,211
This is Flora,
my youngest.

328
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:48,983
Well, as long as you think
you can manage, Mr. Wildhorn.

329
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,487
And why wouldn't I be able
to manage, Mrs. O'Neil?

330
00:19:52,555 --> 00:19:54,222
No reason.

331
00:19:55,657 --> 00:19:57,175
Come here.

332
00:19:57,927 --> 00:20:00,845
Oh, um, just so you know.

333
00:20:00,913 --> 00:20:02,847
Uh, Ringo--

334
00:20:02,915 --> 00:20:06,250
Um, sorry, Spot.

335
00:20:06,318 --> 00:20:08,653
He tends to get stiff
in his hindquarters.

336
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,671
He needs daily exercise.

337
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,440
I'll take it
under advisement.

338
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:19,414
Now, I'm willing
to meet you halfway.

339
00:20:19,482 --> 00:20:22,350
You miss Dave.
I understand that.

340
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:24,352
But your friend
Mrs. O'Neil

341
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,755
had no right
to take you for a walk

342
00:20:26,822 --> 00:20:28,823
without asking me first.

343
00:20:28,891 --> 00:20:30,258
In the future,

344
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:33,695
you will politely decline
all such invitations.

345
00:20:33,763 --> 00:20:34,696
Is that clear?

346
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:39,968
Now that cannot
be the response

347
00:20:40,035 --> 00:20:41,669
to every admonishment.

348
00:20:41,737 --> 00:20:42,587
[Spot/Ringo snorts]

349
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:44,305
[knock on door]

350
00:20:44,373 --> 00:20:45,840
Al Kaiser!

351
00:20:45,908 --> 00:20:46,974
I'm just down the road.

352
00:20:47,042 --> 00:20:49,293
Got the old outboard
in the driveway.

353
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:51,763
Oh, where are
my manners?

354
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,748
Do come in,
Mr. Kaiser.

355
00:20:53,816 --> 00:20:56,116
Can I offer you
a Ding Dong?

356
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,601
Uh, sorry. I can't stay.

357
00:20:57,669 --> 00:21:00,071
I'm having a memorial
for Don at my house.

358
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:02,389
Ah, the basketball
aficionado.

359
00:21:02,457 --> 00:21:04,275
Yes.
It was quite a shock.

360
00:21:04,343 --> 00:21:06,043
Yeah, well, not to me.

361
00:21:06,111 --> 00:21:08,279
Well, I hope
you can make it.

362
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:10,197
Uh, I didn't know
the man.

363
00:21:10,266 --> 00:21:11,766
Everybody's bringing
something.

364
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:14,018
You know, potluck.
See you around 5:00.

365
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:15,904
I didn't know
the man.

366
00:21:15,971 --> 00:21:17,388
See you then!

367
00:21:19,892 --> 00:21:22,526
WILLOW: Did I
miss Daddy's call?

368
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:23,661
Daddy will call you

369
00:21:23,729 --> 00:21:25,529
as soon as he has
time, Willow Tree.

370
00:21:25,597 --> 00:21:27,999
Daddy promised to
help me finish my raft.

371
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:30,267
I'm going to the island
this summer.

372
00:21:30,335 --> 00:21:32,370
What's so important
about that stupid
island, anyway?

373
00:21:33,388 --> 00:21:34,838
That's where
the magic is.

374
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:36,507
You're delusional.

375
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:37,925
Willow.

376
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:39,444
I just don't understand

377
00:21:39,511 --> 00:21:41,162
why I couldn't have
stayed with Dad.

378
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:43,248
I'd like the two of you
to take the salad

379
00:21:43,315 --> 00:21:44,849
down the block
to Don's memorial.

380
00:21:44,916 --> 00:21:46,517
I'm busy.

381
00:21:46,585 --> 00:21:48,386
I'll go, Mama.

382
00:21:48,453 --> 00:21:50,037
Thank you, Finn.

383
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:51,589
What do I do?

384
00:21:51,656 --> 00:21:54,742
You offer our family's
condolences,

385
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,011
and then you leave the salad
and come straight home.

386
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,412
What's condolences?

387
00:21:58,647 --> 00:22:02,150
You say, "We're very sorry
that Don has passed,

388
00:22:02,218 --> 00:22:03,985
but now he's
with all of us."

389
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,620
He is?

390
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:08,238
Just drop off the salad
and look sad.

391
00:22:08,306 --> 00:22:11,426
Ah, I'm so glad
you made it.

392
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:13,311
I brought you Cheetos.

393
00:22:13,478 --> 00:22:15,429
Nice touch. Welcome.

394
00:22:17,098 --> 00:22:18,232
Uh, thanks.

395
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,767
There's plenty to eat,

396
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:21,068
and the beer is on ice,

397
00:22:21,136 --> 00:22:24,004
just the way Don
would have wanted.

398
00:22:24,072 --> 00:22:26,174
A lot of nice
people here.

399
00:22:26,241 --> 00:22:27,741
I think you'll
like everybody.

400
00:22:29,911 --> 00:22:31,111
I must say,

401
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,881
I'm a big admirer
of your work.

402
00:22:33,948 --> 00:22:35,449
Thank you.

403
00:22:35,517 --> 00:22:37,317
I haven't been a dog-sitter
for very long.

404
00:22:37,385 --> 00:22:38,452
No, I'm talking about

405
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,755
those Western novels
you write.

406
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,824
I've got a copy of
Showdown at Red Rock

407
00:22:42,891 --> 00:22:44,792
around somewhere.

408
00:22:44,859 --> 00:22:46,210
It's been out of print
for years.

409
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:48,279
Uh, you mentioned beer?

410
00:22:48,346 --> 00:22:49,664
Beer.
Indeed I did.

411
00:22:51,683 --> 00:22:52,967
Hi, Finn.

412
00:22:53,035 --> 00:22:55,136
Sorry Don died.
Here's a salad.

413
00:22:55,203 --> 00:22:57,271
Don would've
appreciated that.

414
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,073
And thank
your mother for me.

415
00:22:59,141 --> 00:23:00,775
You can add the salad
to that table,

416
00:23:00,843 --> 00:23:03,811
and be an angel
and drop that off, too.

417
00:23:03,879 --> 00:23:06,714
One of the O'Neil
girls.

418
00:23:06,782 --> 00:23:08,032
Sweet kids.

419
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:09,767
Monte Wildhorn,
may I present

420
00:23:09,835 --> 00:23:12,804
Miss Finnegan O'Neil
of Belle Isle.

421
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,373
Pleased to make
your acquaintance.

422
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,307
Can I get more beer?

423
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,642
Ah.

424
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:20,811
Mr. Wildhorn
writes about cowboys

425
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,080
in the Wild West.

426
00:23:22,147 --> 00:23:24,349
Boy, I'll say one thing.

427
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,568
That Jubal McLaws
sure is quick on the draw.

428
00:23:27,636 --> 00:23:30,988
Many cross his path.
Few live to tell about it.

429
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:32,272
Now, that's right,

430
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,674
like when Jubal
had that shootout

431
00:23:33,742 --> 00:23:36,543
with Deadshot Jim Watson
of Albuquerque.

432
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:37,979
Whoo!

433
00:23:38,046 --> 00:23:39,714
Say, if I could find my copy

434
00:23:39,781 --> 00:23:42,216
of Showdown at Red Rock,
would you sign it for me?

435
00:23:42,283 --> 00:23:43,868
I would not, Mr. Kaiser.

436
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:48,139
I've always resisted becoming
part of the cult of celebrity.

437
00:23:48,207 --> 00:23:50,374
However...

438
00:23:50,442 --> 00:23:51,675
I will accept
another beer.

439
00:23:51,827 --> 00:23:54,862
Ah! All right.
I respect that.

440
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,573
I'm not really
from Belle Isle.

441
00:24:06,642 --> 00:24:09,309
We only come here
for the summers.

442
00:24:10,245 --> 00:24:11,595
Is that so?

443
00:24:12,264 --> 00:24:13,615
I live in Manhattan.

444
00:24:15,283 --> 00:24:17,418
At least, I used to.

445
00:24:17,486 --> 00:24:18,953
My dad and mom are
getting divorced,

446
00:24:19,021 --> 00:24:20,187
so now my mom says

447
00:24:20,255 --> 00:24:21,789
we have to live
here all the time.

448
00:24:21,857 --> 00:24:22,606
Hmm...

449
00:24:24,526 --> 00:24:26,828
How come your mom let you
come to an event like this

450
00:24:26,895 --> 00:24:28,312
all by your lonesome?

451
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,447
'Cause I'm 9 1/2 years old.

452
00:24:30,515 --> 00:24:33,367
Hmm, that's pretty old.
I know.

453
00:24:33,435 --> 00:24:35,653
My mom even lets me have
my own pocket knife.

454
00:24:35,787 --> 00:24:38,122
You don't have
no pocket knife.

455
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:40,825
I do so.
Do not.

456
00:24:45,697 --> 00:24:47,231
My, my.

457
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,834
Look at that.

458
00:24:50,902 --> 00:24:53,003
That must be about
the finest pocket knife

459
00:24:53,072 --> 00:24:55,005
I have ever seen.

460
00:24:56,608 --> 00:24:57,875
You know,
you can tell a lot

461
00:24:57,943 --> 00:24:58,959
about a person's
character

462
00:24:58,944 --> 00:25:01,162
by the condition
of their pocket knife.

463
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:04,315
I'd say
you were fearless.

464
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,492
What's his problem?

465
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,396
Oh, he's just
being Carl Loop.

466
00:25:18,463 --> 00:25:21,215
Willow says he's retarded,
but Mom says he's special.

467
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:23,384
Hmm. Well,
whatever he is,

468
00:25:23,452 --> 00:25:25,286
he's a fine dancer.

469
00:25:27,189 --> 00:25:28,488
You write stories?

470
00:25:30,892 --> 00:25:32,326
I used to.

471
00:25:32,393 --> 00:25:35,412
My favorite story is about
aliens from outer space.

472
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:38,900
Mm. Extraterrestrials
have their place,

473
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:41,201
and I've met a few,

474
00:25:41,269 --> 00:25:43,004
but you don't have
to leave this planet

475
00:25:43,071 --> 00:25:44,705
to tell a good story.

476
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,142
How...

477
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,276
How do you make 'em up?

478
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:51,128
Imagination.

479
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:52,563
The most powerful force

480
00:25:52,631 --> 00:25:55,032
ever made available
to humankind.

481
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:57,985
Here you go.

482
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:03,040
Hey, Monte,
I'm no professional,

483
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:05,376
but I wrote this speech
for Don,

484
00:26:05,444 --> 00:26:08,446
but I'll never be able
to get through it.

485
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:10,181
I was gonna ask you
to read it out loud.

486
00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:11,849
I've always
had a disdain

487
00:26:11,916 --> 00:26:14,902
for public displays
of sentimentality,
Mr. Kaiser.

488
00:26:14,969 --> 00:26:18,005
Hey, who doesn't?
Don would be so pleased.

489
00:26:18,073 --> 00:26:18,872
Didn't know the man.

490
00:26:18,941 --> 00:26:21,341
Monte has something
he wants to read to us

491
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,710
about Don.

492
00:26:22,911 --> 00:26:24,345
So, if you would,
just step outside

493
00:26:24,413 --> 00:26:25,879
as quickly as you can.

494
00:26:25,947 --> 00:26:28,799
Thank you so much.
He's very excited about this.

495
00:26:28,867 --> 00:26:30,868
Hi, nice to see you. I didn't
get a chance to say hello.

496
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:33,237
Oh, I didn't know you were
here. Hi. Welcome.

497
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:36,057
All right, people, this is
a sad and happy occasion.

498
00:26:36,125 --> 00:26:37,458
Thanks for coming here.

499
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,111
Everybody please say hello
to Monte Wildhorn.

500
00:26:56,294 --> 00:26:58,479
"'Jesus H. Christ.'"

501
00:27:00,565 --> 00:27:02,933
"According to our friend
Karen Loop,

502
00:27:03,001 --> 00:27:05,019
"that's how most people
around the lake reacted

503
00:27:05,087 --> 00:27:08,239
"when they heard the news
of Don's passing.

504
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:11,042
"That's not such a bad obit.

505
00:27:11,109 --> 00:27:14,478
"Concise.
Even rather eloquent.

506
00:27:14,779 --> 00:27:16,898
"Don would've approved.

507
00:27:16,965 --> 00:27:19,901
"There are people in life
you avoid,

508
00:27:19,968 --> 00:27:22,870
"and others you go
out of your way to bump into.

509
00:27:22,938 --> 00:27:26,173
"Don had that bump-into
quality about him,

510
00:27:26,341 --> 00:27:30,711
"which is why nobody ever ducked
when they saw Don coming.

511
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:34,414
"He took beer very seriously.

512
00:27:34,482 --> 00:27:37,284
"It had to be Pabst Blue Ribbon.

513
00:27:37,352 --> 00:27:39,820
"If it couldn't be Pabst,

514
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:41,588
"it at least had to be cold.

515
00:27:41,656 --> 00:27:44,158
"As good as Don was,

516
00:27:44,226 --> 00:27:48,829
"I think he only got better
once he found the Belle.

517
00:27:48,897 --> 00:27:52,082
"There just might be something
special about this place.

518
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:55,686
"It don't happen too often,
but sometimes

519
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:59,590
"we do bring out
the best in each other.

520
00:27:59,657 --> 00:28:02,226
"We'll miss you, Don.

521
00:28:02,294 --> 00:28:04,962
Watch over us."

522
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,902
Don't change a word.

523
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,437
The man at Dog Dave's
writes stories

524
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:15,722
about cowboys
in the Wild West.

525
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,358
He does?

526
00:28:17,425 --> 00:28:19,526
Yeah...
not about space aliens.

527
00:28:19,594 --> 00:28:21,095
No aliens?

528
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:22,796
Mm-mm.

529
00:28:22,864 --> 00:28:24,598
You know, you don't have
to go off this planet

530
00:28:24,665 --> 00:28:26,867
to tell a good story.

531
00:28:26,935 --> 00:28:30,170
Mama, when we get home,
can I work on my raft?

532
00:28:30,238 --> 00:28:33,507
No, you promised
you'd clean your room.

533
00:28:33,574 --> 00:28:36,043
Well,
Jesus H. Christ!

534
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:38,078
Ms. O'Neil.

535
00:28:38,146 --> 00:28:41,782
That is a most unbecoming
use of language.

536
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:44,185
Mr. Kaiser wrote it
about Don.

537
00:28:44,252 --> 00:28:46,286
You're not Mr. Kaiser.

538
00:28:46,354 --> 00:28:48,288
Am I in trouble?

539
00:28:48,356 --> 00:28:50,024
You most certainly are,

540
00:28:50,091 --> 00:28:51,191
and your punishment

541
00:28:51,259 --> 00:28:52,759
is to memorize
three new words

542
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:55,595
and define them for me
by dinner Friday.

543
00:28:55,663 --> 00:28:57,614
And I expect
to be impressed.

544
00:28:57,682 --> 00:28:59,683
You will be.
I promise.

545
00:29:01,203 --> 00:29:02,236
Hmm.

546
00:29:10,445 --> 00:29:12,596
Who does your taxes?

547
00:29:12,664 --> 00:29:14,931
I am currently
without an accountant,

548
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:16,133
Mrs. Loop.

549
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:17,768
Karen.

550
00:29:17,835 --> 00:29:19,503
I have aspired
for years

551
00:29:19,571 --> 00:29:21,938
to someday attain
the poverty level.

552
00:29:22,006 --> 00:29:24,608
Having recently
achieved my goal,

553
00:29:24,676 --> 00:29:27,811
I'm not in need of
such services just now.

554
00:29:27,879 --> 00:29:31,081
I always get my clients
a big refund.

555
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:35,419
You have a positive
outlook on life, Karen.

556
00:29:35,487 --> 00:29:37,321
This is our place.

557
00:29:37,389 --> 00:29:40,090
Thanks for
walking us home.

558
00:29:40,158 --> 00:29:42,693
You and the boy
on your own out here?

559
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,379
My old man took off
after Carl was born.

560
00:29:45,447 --> 00:29:47,197
I'm sorry to hear that.

561
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,567
It's no great loss.

562
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:53,737
Well, if there's
anything I can do.

563
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:56,957
Carl never gets
any phone calls.

564
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:00,644
It would be nice for him
to get a phone call.

565
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:02,846
Here's my business card.

566
00:30:04,632 --> 00:30:07,151
It's got our
home number on it.

567
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:10,353
Telephone's
a damn nuisance.

568
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:13,307
Ain't got
no use for it.

569
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:14,775
And them people
on cell phones

570
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,844
oughta be shot dead
in the street.

571
00:30:25,369 --> 00:30:26,920
Hey, Carl.

572
00:30:33,878 --> 00:30:36,580
How'd you like to be
my faithful sidekick,

573
00:30:36,648 --> 00:30:37,948
Diego Santana?

574
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:41,185
Wanted for train robbery
in three territories.

575
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:42,853
I am?

576
00:30:42,921 --> 00:30:46,973
Railroad Pinkertons are
hot on our trail, amigo.

577
00:30:48,843 --> 00:30:50,110
How do I be Diego?

578
00:30:50,212 --> 00:30:53,813
Well, for starters,
lose the bunny hop.

579
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,204
[chuckling]

580
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:11,147
[snoring]

581
00:31:20,358 --> 00:31:23,960
Yeah, I'm touched
by your concern.

582
00:31:24,028 --> 00:31:25,962
Thank God
I'm still drinking.

583
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:28,532
Saves me the humiliation
of falling off the wagon.

584
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,700
FINN:
I need three words.

585
00:31:30,768 --> 00:31:33,336
Have we met?

586
00:31:38,442 --> 00:31:40,377
Did I extend an invitation?

587
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:41,812
No.

588
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,047
I didn't think so.

589
00:31:45,383 --> 00:31:48,418
You know a lot of good words
'cause you write stories.

590
00:31:48,486 --> 00:31:50,387
I need three good ones
for my mom.

591
00:31:50,454 --> 00:31:53,256
I lost all my good
words a long time ago.

592
00:31:53,324 --> 00:31:55,275
What about imagination?

593
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:57,244
Should I use that one?

594
00:31:57,312 --> 00:32:00,147
Last time I checked,
it was still available.

595
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:03,084
Can you teach me
to write stories?

596
00:32:03,151 --> 00:32:06,770
You are
awfully demanding.

597
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,440
All right, Spot.

598
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,977
Time for
our morning dose.

599
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:17,298
[stirring mixture]

600
00:32:19,801 --> 00:32:21,134
There you go.

601
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,004
That's a good boy.

602
00:32:24,072 --> 00:32:26,173
How come you
give him aspirin?

603
00:32:26,241 --> 00:32:27,841
Uh, it seems Spot
has developed

604
00:32:27,908 --> 00:32:29,843
some stiffness
in his hindquarters.

605
00:32:30,995 --> 00:32:32,646
And aspirin helps that.

606
00:32:34,732 --> 00:32:35,865
I'm not exactly sure,

607
00:32:35,933 --> 00:32:38,202
but long as
he thinks it does,

608
00:32:38,269 --> 00:32:39,969
that's half
the battle, isn't it?

609
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,860
How come you don't
write on a computer?

610
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,432
I'm gonna
answer your question

611
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,767
in return
for blessed silence.

612
00:32:59,508 --> 00:33:01,175
Look at that machine.

613
00:33:01,926 --> 00:33:03,644
I like that you
have to write

614
00:33:03,711 --> 00:33:05,945
a bit slower
on a manual.

615
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:08,114
I like the way
it sounds.

616
00:33:08,216 --> 00:33:11,802
I like
the way the letters

617
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,470
bite into the paper.

618
00:33:15,173 --> 00:33:17,675
I like that you can feel
there's a genuine human being

619
00:33:17,742 --> 00:33:19,509
doing the work--
Hands off.

620
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,265
What's that?

621
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:29,252
Buckaroo.
What's a Buckaroo?

622
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,272
It's an award
for literary excellence.

623
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,393
"Western Authors Academy.
Best Western novel.

624
00:33:36,461 --> 00:33:37,961
'The Saga of Jubal McLaws.'

625
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:41,031
Presented
to Monte Wildhorn. 1975."

626
00:33:41,099 --> 00:33:44,034
Cool. Did you give
a speech when you won?

627
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,453
Yes, ma'am, I did.

628
00:33:46,521 --> 00:33:48,255
Who'd you thank?

629
00:33:48,322 --> 00:33:51,024
My one true love
and three bartenders.

630
00:33:53,694 --> 00:33:55,595
How come you can't walk?

631
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:59,516
Who says I can't?

632
00:34:02,571 --> 00:34:04,405
Why are you
in a wheelchair?

633
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:07,391
Can you keep a secret?

634
00:34:10,828 --> 00:34:12,212
Even if they torture me.

635
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:16,250
I'm attempting to defraud

636
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:18,619
the Liberty Mutual
insurance conglomerate

637
00:34:18,687 --> 00:34:20,387
out of a million dollars.

638
00:34:21,706 --> 00:34:22,873
What's defraud?

639
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:26,710
Cheat, snooker,
fleece, bamboozle.

640
00:34:26,778 --> 00:34:29,579
So you can walk?

641
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:31,431
I can run.

642
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,034
But I have to be careful.

643
00:34:34,185 --> 00:34:35,819
If those Liberty Mutual
boys catch me

644
00:34:35,887 --> 00:34:39,156
while I'm out
for a quick jog,
it's all over.

645
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:41,108
I can kiss
that million bucks good-bye

646
00:34:41,175 --> 00:34:43,160
and say hello
to Yuma State Prison.

647
00:34:43,227 --> 00:34:45,228
You could go to jail?

648
00:34:45,296 --> 00:34:46,763
Oh, yeah.

649
00:34:46,998 --> 00:34:48,916
But what's jail?

650
00:34:48,984 --> 00:34:53,320
As John Milton once said,
"The mind is its own place."

651
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:01,428
So what do those, uh,

652
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:03,196
Liberty Mutual boys
look like?

653
00:35:04,749 --> 00:35:05,883
Suits.

654
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:07,718
Suits, huh?

655
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:10,437
I'll make you a deal.

656
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,942
You teach
me about imagination,

657
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:17,010
and I'll keep a lookout.

658
00:35:17,078 --> 00:35:21,198
That might be asking
too much.

659
00:35:21,265 --> 00:35:25,568
I can pay you,
$34 and 18 cents in cash.

660
00:35:25,636 --> 00:35:27,204
I saved it up.

661
00:35:27,271 --> 00:35:28,505
[chuckles]

662
00:35:28,573 --> 00:35:31,208
And what exactly would
you want for your money?

663
00:35:31,275 --> 00:35:33,777
I wanna know
where stories come from.

664
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:35,745
Ah...

665
00:35:35,813 --> 00:35:37,664
you want a mentor.

666
00:35:38,866 --> 00:35:40,334
A what?

667
00:35:40,402 --> 00:35:42,485
You absolutely sure
you want to set foot

668
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:44,688
into such a mysterious realm?

669
00:35:44,756 --> 00:35:45,989
I'm sure.

670
00:35:46,056 --> 00:35:47,057
You may get lost in there

671
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,975
and not be able to find
your way back.

672
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:51,878
You said I'm fearless.

673
00:35:51,946 --> 00:35:53,329
That I did.

674
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,583
So, we got a deal?

675
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:57,884
My word is my bond.

676
00:35:57,952 --> 00:36:00,654
Great. So, when's
my first lesson?

677
00:36:00,722 --> 00:36:02,005
You just had it.

678
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:06,627
Huh?

679
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,128
I can't walk.

680
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:11,882
What do you mean?

681
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:15,335
I mean, I can't walk.
I just made up a story.

682
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:17,370
Really?

683
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:18,705
Really.

684
00:36:18,772 --> 00:36:21,124
You're kind of a jerk.

685
00:36:21,191 --> 00:36:23,576
Did you picture me running?

686
00:36:25,763 --> 00:36:27,164
Yeah.

687
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,534
Did you see those men
in suits coming after me?

688
00:36:30,601 --> 00:36:32,719
Yeah.

689
00:36:32,786 --> 00:36:34,955
So did I.

690
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:36,457
That's imagination.

691
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:40,844
But you--

692
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:42,012
Class dismissed.

693
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,915
We'll have
another lesson tomorrow.

694
00:36:44,982 --> 00:36:47,417
Okay.

695
00:36:51,239 --> 00:36:53,624
I still think you're a jerk.

696
00:36:54,825 --> 00:36:56,426
Fair enough.

697
00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:16,713
Jubal McLaws.

698
00:37:19,834 --> 00:37:21,852
You got
my last Wildhorn there.

699
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,437
It's gonna run you
35 cents.

700
00:37:23,505 --> 00:37:26,039
It's discounted
because it's missing
the last page.

701
00:37:26,107 --> 00:37:28,225
Somebody tore it right
out of the book.

702
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,493
That's okay.
I'll take it.

703
00:37:36,084 --> 00:37:39,453
What would you say
if we extend a dinner
invitation this evening

704
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,920
to our local author?

705
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,989
Yes, Mama, please!
Oh, God.

706
00:37:43,057 --> 00:37:44,842
But he only eats
worms, Mama.

707
00:37:44,909 --> 00:37:46,877
Flora,

708
00:37:46,945 --> 00:37:48,444
Finn was just teasing you.

709
00:37:48,512 --> 00:37:49,879
I think it would be good
for you ladies

710
00:37:49,947 --> 00:37:51,398
to experience
a literary man.

711
00:37:51,466 --> 00:37:52,966
WILLOW: How do you expect
that to happen?

712
00:37:53,268 --> 00:37:54,084
He needs a ramp.

713
00:37:54,151 --> 00:37:55,936
We're not exactly
handicap-friendly.

714
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:57,086
I'll build it.

715
00:37:57,154 --> 00:37:57,938
Thank you, Finn.

716
00:37:58,006 --> 00:37:59,289
Let me know
if I can help.

717
00:37:59,357 --> 00:38:01,875
[cell ring tone sounding]
It's Dad.

718
00:38:01,943 --> 00:38:03,760
Maybe he'd like
to come to dinner tonight.

719
00:38:03,827 --> 00:38:05,745
I wanna talk.

720
00:38:05,813 --> 00:38:07,647
After me. Hi, Dad.

721
00:38:07,715 --> 00:38:10,433
When am I gonna see you?

722
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:12,335
Dad's coming the weekend
of Flora's birthday.

723
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:13,570
Tell Dad he has
to finish my raft.

724
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:15,071
When's the weekend
of my birthday, Mama?

725
00:38:15,139 --> 00:38:16,289
It's in August, baby.

726
00:38:16,357 --> 00:38:18,241
When's that?
Soon.

727
00:38:18,308 --> 00:38:20,043
Tell your father
I'll call him back.

728
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,811
No, he wants
to talk to you now.

729
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:24,331
Not while I'm driving.

730
00:38:24,499 --> 00:38:27,967
Today, I will introduce
our summer athletic program.

731
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:30,754
The traditional game
of fetch,

732
00:38:30,821 --> 00:38:33,724
which I'm sure
you are familiar with.

733
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:37,594
I hold in my hand
a Major League baseball.

734
00:38:37,729 --> 00:38:40,263
You might be interested
to know, sir,

735
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,832
that before I lost
the use of my left arm,

736
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,570
I was known to possess
a mean cut fast ball.

737
00:38:46,637 --> 00:38:49,973
Therefore, my affinity
for this wondrous sphere

738
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:52,209
should come as no surprise.

739
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,545
Fetch.

740
00:38:58,432 --> 00:39:01,150
I see the concept
of fetch eludes you.

741
00:39:02,386 --> 00:39:04,203
I blame Dave for that.

742
00:39:04,271 --> 00:39:08,208
For the record,
this will be the last time

743
00:39:08,276 --> 00:39:10,110
I fetch the ball.

744
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:13,329
When do we start?

745
00:39:17,801 --> 00:39:18,835
Start what?

746
00:39:18,902 --> 00:39:20,119
My imagination.

747
00:39:20,187 --> 00:39:22,555
$34 and 18 cents.
It's all there.

748
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,324
Uh, yeah.

749
00:39:26,077 --> 00:39:28,845
Well, no time
like the present.

750
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:32,382
What do you see
up this street?

751
00:39:35,153 --> 00:39:37,287
Nothing.
Just a street.

752
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,925
Okay, try telling me
what you don't see.

753
00:39:43,011 --> 00:39:44,077
Huh?

754
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:46,380
What don't you see?

755
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:47,197
I just told you.

756
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:49,716
Work with me.

757
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,284
See with
your mind's eye.

758
00:39:55,273 --> 00:39:57,807
Well, I sure don't see
no cowboy riding a horse.

759
00:39:57,875 --> 00:39:59,309
Well, if you're
looking for Jubal,

760
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:00,844
you'll never see him.

761
00:40:00,911 --> 00:40:02,061
Why not?

762
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:03,963
Gotta look
for your own things.

763
00:40:04,031 --> 00:40:05,431
How do I do that?

764
00:40:07,068 --> 00:40:08,334
Keep lookin'.

765
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,541
I paid you.

766
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:17,394
There's a mystery to
making things up, kiddo,

767
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:20,497
and life offers
no guarantees.

768
00:40:20,564 --> 00:40:22,381
You got till
the end of the summer,

769
00:40:22,449 --> 00:40:23,850
or I want my money back.

770
00:40:25,252 --> 00:40:26,519
Well, I've always
done my best

771
00:40:26,588 --> 00:40:28,655
when working
under a deadline.

772
00:40:34,445 --> 00:40:36,062
You're invited over
for dinner tonight,

773
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,330
precisely at 7:00.

774
00:40:41,051 --> 00:40:42,886
Oh, dear.

775
00:40:48,692 --> 00:40:49,742
Hey, Finn.

776
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,661
Oh, hi, Carl.

777
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:55,998
I'm not Carl.

778
00:40:56,066 --> 00:40:57,867
I'm Diego Santana...

779
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,304
train robber
and faithful sidekick.

780
00:41:01,371 --> 00:41:03,139
Whose sidekick?

781
00:41:03,207 --> 00:41:05,191
The man at Dog Dave's.

782
00:41:05,259 --> 00:41:07,293
What are you doing?

783
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:08,895
Building a ramp for Monte.

784
00:41:08,963 --> 00:41:10,213
Who's Monte?

785
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:11,881
The man at Dog Dave's.

786
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:13,533
I'm his sidekick.

787
00:41:13,601 --> 00:41:16,002
Good, then you can
help me build this.

788
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:17,336
I can do that.

789
00:41:17,404 --> 00:41:19,405
[telephone rings,
machine beeps]

790
00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:21,524
Hey, Uncle Monte.
It's Henry.

791
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:23,794
Just calling to see
how that whole killing
yourself thing

792
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:25,228
is working out for you.

793
00:41:27,364 --> 00:41:31,167
It's temporarily postponed.

794
00:41:31,436 --> 00:41:33,553
Oh. Well,
the summer's young.

795
00:41:33,621 --> 00:41:37,390
An invitation has been
extended for dinner.

796
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:39,176
Next door.

797
00:41:39,243 --> 00:41:41,445
I've accepted.

798
00:41:41,512 --> 00:41:43,146
What, the beautiful woman
from the roof?

799
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:43,996
The very same.

800
00:41:44,064 --> 00:41:45,982
Well, that's great!

801
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:46,750
You know what to do?

802
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:47,851
Eat?

803
00:41:47,919 --> 00:41:49,802
Just bring her something nice.

804
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:50,453
Pick some flowers.

805
00:41:50,521 --> 00:41:52,104
Too conventional.

806
00:41:52,172 --> 00:41:53,873
Well, you'll figure it out.

807
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:56,893
I'm guessing you didn't
call Joe Viola back.

808
00:41:56,961 --> 00:41:58,344
Correct.

809
00:41:58,412 --> 00:42:00,129
Why don't you just listen
to what he has to say?

810
00:42:00,197 --> 00:42:01,514
Not interested.

811
00:42:01,582 --> 00:42:03,366
You take care
of yourself, Uncle Monte.

812
00:42:03,434 --> 00:42:05,251
Not interested.

813
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:07,019
Okay, bye, Uncle Monte.

814
00:42:07,087 --> 00:42:09,705
Bye, young Henry.

815
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:47,377
Oh.

816
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:50,864
As I recall, it's improper
to arrive empty-handed.

817
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:52,014
A mirror?

818
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:53,115
I figure a house
full of ladies

819
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:54,934
could always
use another one.

820
00:42:55,002 --> 00:42:56,403
Well, thank you.

821
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,004
This is quite
a unique gift.

822
00:43:00,374 --> 00:43:01,441
Do come in,
Mr. Wildhorn.

823
00:43:01,508 --> 00:43:02,725
Thank you.

824
00:43:04,011 --> 00:43:06,129
I didn't think you'd mind
if Spot came along.

825
00:43:06,196 --> 00:43:07,330
He's always welcome.

826
00:43:07,398 --> 00:43:10,066
May I take your hat,
Mr. Wildhorn?

827
00:43:10,134 --> 00:43:11,535
Why, thank you, Flora.

828
00:43:11,602 --> 00:43:15,138
Ladies, please see
Mr. Wildhorn to the table.

829
00:43:15,206 --> 00:43:16,656
I hope you like chicken.

830
00:43:16,724 --> 00:43:18,758
Never had a chicken
do me wrong.

831
00:43:18,959 --> 00:43:20,976
Finn tells me
you write books.

832
00:43:21,044 --> 00:43:22,778
It's been a while.

833
00:43:22,846 --> 00:43:25,415
No texting at the table,
okay, Willow?

834
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:28,284
I always felt
like a book is...

835
00:43:28,352 --> 00:43:31,254
a friend that does
what no friend can do.

836
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:33,373
Stay quiet when you wanna think.

837
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,559
[chuckles]

838
00:43:35,626 --> 00:43:37,844
Would you care for
some wine, Mr. Wildhorn?

839
00:43:37,912 --> 00:43:40,814
Ordinarily, I don't indulge,
Mrs. O'Neil,

840
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:44,184
but since I may
work my way up to a toast,

841
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:45,451
I think maybe
a glass of wine

842
00:43:45,519 --> 00:43:47,788
might be in order,
just this once.

843
00:43:47,855 --> 00:43:50,073
You'll have to excuse me
if I don't get up.

844
00:43:50,141 --> 00:43:53,276
I started
reading The Saga
of Jubal McLaws.

845
00:43:53,544 --> 00:43:54,578
It's really cool.

846
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:57,914
Oh, one
of my kinder reviews.

847
00:43:57,982 --> 00:43:59,516
I got it cheap
'cause it didn't have
the last page.

848
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,400
Oh, you're not missing much.

849
00:44:01,468 --> 00:44:04,370
I always meant to rewrite
that page anyway.

850
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:06,239
Are all your books
about the West?

851
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:07,857
Pretty much.

852
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:11,344
I love horses. I used
to ride when I was a child.

853
00:44:11,412 --> 00:44:13,296
Can you pass the gravy,
please?

854
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:15,214
Good horse
is half the dream.

855
00:44:15,282 --> 00:44:17,383
What's the other half?

856
00:44:17,451 --> 00:44:20,170
Your knight in shining armor.

857
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:24,307
Do you know any stories
about elephants?

858
00:44:24,374 --> 00:44:26,610
Flora loves elephants.

859
00:44:26,677 --> 00:44:28,444
I'm afraid I'm not
a reliable source

860
00:44:28,512 --> 00:44:30,730
when it comes
to pachyderms.

861
00:44:32,049 --> 00:44:34,150
How did Jubal come to be
the man who rides alone?

862
00:44:34,218 --> 00:44:36,970
He didn't have much choice.

863
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,057
The end of the Civil War,

864
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:44,627
Jubal rode home to Texas
to be reunited with his family.

865
00:44:44,695 --> 00:44:45,795
It took
a good many years

866
00:44:45,862 --> 00:44:47,614
before he
could bring himself

867
00:44:47,681 --> 00:44:49,048
to mention
the ghastly sight
that awaited him

868
00:44:49,116 --> 00:44:51,518
when he arrived back
at the old homestead.

869
00:44:51,585 --> 00:44:52,769
What happened?

870
00:44:52,836 --> 00:44:55,505
Comanche raiding party.

871
00:44:55,573 --> 00:44:58,575
His papa's horse
had been gut shot,

872
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:01,645
pin-cushioned with arrows
and left to suffer.

873
00:45:01,712 --> 00:45:03,863
He found
his beloved mother

874
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:07,049
outside the cabin,
her head nearly severed,

875
00:45:07,117 --> 00:45:08,818
her stomach ripped open.

876
00:45:08,886 --> 00:45:10,737
Remember, girls,
it's just a story.

877
00:45:10,804 --> 00:45:12,071
Just a story?

878
00:45:12,139 --> 00:45:14,723
I only meant
that it didn't really happen.

879
00:45:14,959 --> 00:45:18,161
It happened to Jubal.

880
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,216
Mashed potatoes, Mr. Wildhorn?

881
00:45:25,169 --> 00:45:29,021
MONTE: Sweet old place
you've got here, Mrs. O'Neil.

882
00:45:29,090 --> 00:45:32,324
Belonged to my grandparents,
then my mom.

883
00:45:32,392 --> 00:45:34,126
I spent my summers here
growing up.

884
00:45:34,194 --> 00:45:36,179
Well, I prefer growing up
in the city,

885
00:45:36,246 --> 00:45:38,782
but instead,
I'm being held prisoner here.

886
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,286
Are you ready
for my three words, Mama?

887
00:45:43,353 --> 00:45:45,588
If you're prepared.

888
00:45:45,656 --> 00:45:47,490
Can I be excused?

889
00:45:47,558 --> 00:45:50,009
You may not.
Go ahead, Finn.

890
00:45:50,077 --> 00:45:52,078
One, imagination:

891
00:45:52,146 --> 00:45:54,647
the process of forming
a mental image of something

892
00:45:54,715 --> 00:45:57,917
never before perceived
by the imaginer in reality.

893
00:45:57,985 --> 00:46:00,770
Besides being
the most powerful force

894
00:46:00,838 --> 00:46:03,406
ever made available
for humankind.

895
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,258
Two,

896
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:06,909
bamboozle:

897
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:09,479
to deceive or get the better
of somebody by trickery.

898
00:46:09,547 --> 00:46:12,165
Cheat, fleece, or snooker.

899
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:13,148
[laughs]

900
00:46:13,467 --> 00:46:15,334
And your third word?

901
00:46:15,636 --> 00:46:17,687
Mentor:

902
00:46:17,754 --> 00:46:21,891
a trusted counselor
or guide, tutor or coach.

903
00:46:23,777 --> 00:46:25,995
Interesting choices.

904
00:46:26,063 --> 00:46:28,564
I'm gonna be seven
this summer.

905
00:46:28,632 --> 00:46:29,699
You can
come to my party.

906
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:31,451
Flora, he doesn't want to.

907
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:33,820
Finnegan.
It's August 15th.

908
00:46:33,888 --> 00:46:35,354
And you're under
no obligation.

909
00:46:35,422 --> 00:46:37,824
To the contrary.

910
00:46:37,892 --> 00:46:39,893
I greatly appreciate
being included

911
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:42,028
in your celebratory plans

912
00:46:42,095 --> 00:46:45,731
and I will be sure to mark
that special day on my calendar.

913
00:46:48,418 --> 00:46:50,053
Who plays the piano?

914
00:46:50,121 --> 00:46:52,938
I've been trying
to teach these three,
to no avail.

915
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:55,492
Do you appreciate music,
Mr. Wildhorn?

916
00:46:55,559 --> 00:46:57,477
Oh, yes, ma'am, I do.

917
00:46:57,545 --> 00:47:01,914
In my younger days, I was often
complimented for my voice.

918
00:47:01,982 --> 00:47:04,384
Would you like
to sing for us?

919
00:47:04,452 --> 00:47:06,586
It's the least I can do.

920
00:47:06,653 --> 00:47:08,421
Now may I be excused?

921
00:47:08,488 --> 00:47:12,125
No. Mr. Wildhorn's
going to favor us with a song.

922
00:47:13,043 --> 00:47:15,978
¶ Oh, a captain
born in Halifax ¶

923
00:47:16,046 --> 00:47:18,114
¶ Who dwelt
in country quarters ¶

924
00:47:18,182 --> 00:47:19,899
¶ Seduced a maid
who hanged herself ¶

925
00:47:19,967 --> 00:47:21,734
¶ Next morning
in her garters ¶

926
00:47:21,802 --> 00:47:22,835
I don't think
I know that one.

927
00:47:23,037 --> 00:47:26,238
Well, okay...
play something you do know.

928
00:47:28,342 --> 00:47:31,560
Um, well...

929
00:47:31,829 --> 00:47:33,563
it's not a song, exactly.

930
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:36,666
But...here goes.

931
00:47:37,901 --> 00:47:41,154
[playing Beethoven's
Pathetique Sonata]

932
00:48:14,788 --> 00:48:17,774
Mmm, I would leave
all my windows open

933
00:48:17,841 --> 00:48:20,242
to hear that kind of playing.

934
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:24,830
That would be
one of my kinder reviews.

935
00:48:24,898 --> 00:48:26,699
[Spot barking]

936
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:29,918
He's telling me
I've outstayed my welcome.

937
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:33,122
All right, girls. Let's say
good night to Mr. Wildhorn.

938
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:36,759
Good night, Monte.

939
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:38,093
Oh, good night, Flora.

940
00:48:40,197 --> 00:48:41,764
I'll be ready first thing
in the morning.

941
00:48:41,832 --> 00:48:43,399
For what?

942
00:48:43,467 --> 00:48:45,000
You know.

943
00:48:45,068 --> 00:48:46,669
Oh, oh, oh. All right.

944
00:48:46,737 --> 00:48:48,705
Yeah, thanks
for the reminder.

945
00:48:50,106 --> 00:48:52,509
Girls, you can
clear the table.
You too, Willow.

946
00:48:55,645 --> 00:48:57,313
Mrs. O'Neil,

947
00:48:57,414 --> 00:49:00,483
I want to thank you
for a very lovely evening.

948
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,984
I don't believe I have ever

949
00:49:02,052 --> 00:49:03,803
heard Beethoven's
Pathetique Sonata

950
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,805
played with such affection.

951
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:07,857
You know the piece.

952
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:10,426
Well, when I was writing,

953
00:49:10,494 --> 00:49:12,545
I listened
to all kinds of music.

954
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:18,467
Mr. Wildhorn.

955
00:49:22,839 --> 00:49:27,026
Why did you stop writing?

956
00:49:27,093 --> 00:49:30,145
Same reason
I gave up religion.

957
00:49:30,213 --> 00:49:34,166
God confided in me
that he's an atheist.

958
00:49:36,186 --> 00:49:39,121
Did your Jubal McLaws
ever love a woman?

959
00:49:41,191 --> 00:49:43,158
Well, Jubal
always got the girl,

960
00:49:43,226 --> 00:49:47,430
but he only
fell in love once.

961
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:49,899
That's more than some.

962
00:49:49,966 --> 00:49:52,268
Did they live
happily ever after?

963
00:49:52,335 --> 00:49:53,903
No.

964
00:49:54,104 --> 00:49:58,324
He lost her
to the influenza
in Cattle Wars.

965
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:01,410
And he never fell in love
after that?

966
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:05,964
How could he?

967
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:12,555
I think Jubal
has quite a hold on you.

968
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:19,161
Well, all the things
I couldn't do
in the real world,

969
00:50:19,229 --> 00:50:21,430
Jubal let me do
on the page.

970
00:50:24,568 --> 00:50:26,502
Good night, Mrs. O'Neil.

971
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:28,537
Thanks for
the chicken dinner.

972
00:50:33,961 --> 00:50:36,412
You owe me a toast,
Mr. Wildhorn.

973
00:50:36,479 --> 00:50:38,247
I'm good for it.

974
00:50:44,071 --> 00:50:46,606

Fetch.

981
00:51:06,293 --> 00:51:09,945
Maybe it's the word "fetch"
that doesn't resonate.

982
00:51:10,014 --> 00:51:13,249
Perhaps "retrieve"
will stimulate

983
00:51:13,317 --> 00:51:16,452
some long-dormant instinct.

984
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,188

Oh, hi, Monte?

It's a phone call,
for you.

1008
00:53:15,522 --> 00:53:17,423
It is? Who is it?

1009
00:53:17,491 --> 00:53:18,741
Well, find out.

1010
00:53:18,809 --> 00:53:21,093
This is Carl Loop.

Do you always wear

00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:48,320
I wear
a white hat, Diego,

1020
00:53:48,388 --> 00:53:50,523
so the folks
can tell the good guys

Then no one
knows I'm Carl.

'Cause I'm a drunk,

Get drunk enough,
you'll cry over anything.

How?

1063
00:56:15,501 --> 00:56:16,518
She runs to her neighbor,
Al Kaiser's house

1064
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:18,254
and disappears
around the back.

When the bad guy
gets there,

of an open door that leads
down to the cellar.

When the bad guys goes down
the stairs to grab her,

1069
00:56:26,613 --> 00:56:28,230
she jumps out from
behind the big oak tree

1070
00:56:28,298 --> 00:56:29,998
where she's been hiding
and lifts

1071
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:31,200
that heavy door
off the ground

1072
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:32,567
and closes it
on top of him,

1073
00:56:32,669 --> 00:56:33,752
and before
he can escape,

1074
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:36,088
she grabs
the rake Al Kaiser
keeps by the door

1075
00:56:36,156 --> 00:56:37,289
and slides it
through the handles,

1076
00:56:37,357 --> 00:56:38,557
which traps the bad guy

1077
00:56:38,625 --> 00:56:40,492
until the cops
come to take him away.

1135
01:00:34,895 --> 01:00:36,295
All my friends
are in the city.

1136
01:00:36,362 --> 01:00:37,729
You know,
he can't even show up

1137
01:00:37,797 --> 01:00:39,231
for his own daughter's
birthday party.

1138
01:00:39,499 --> 01:00:41,850
Maybe he just didn't
want to see you.

1139
01:00:41,918 --> 01:00:43,051
That's enough.

1140
01:00:54,914 --> 01:00:58,317
Why don't I just go and talk
to Flora for a minute?

1141
01:00:59,268 --> 01:01:00,685
Okay.

1142
01:01:03,106 --> 01:01:05,541
I'm looking for
the birthday girl.

1143
01:01:05,742 --> 01:01:07,659
You know where
I can find her?

1144
01:01:08,445 --> 01:01:10,262
I'm the birthday girl.

1145
01:01:10,329 --> 01:01:11,947
Oh, good.

1146
01:01:12,015 --> 01:01:14,449
'Cause I got
something for you.

1147
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:16,218
What is it?

1148
01:01:16,286 --> 01:01:17,652
It's your birthday present.

1149
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,804
I think it's here.
Where'd I put it?

1150
01:01:19,872 --> 01:01:21,973
Ah, there it is.

1151
01:01:22,042 --> 01:01:23,308
Happy birthday.

1152
01:01:23,543 --> 01:01:25,310
What is it?

1153
01:01:25,378 --> 01:01:26,311
It's a story.

1154
01:01:26,379 --> 01:01:27,696
About what?

1155
01:01:27,764 --> 01:01:30,115
About an elephant
named Tony.

1156
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:32,685
Well, he said he was
a friend of yours,

1157
01:01:32,752 --> 01:01:36,288
and he asked me
to write it down for him.

1158
01:01:36,356 --> 01:01:37,706
Is Tony a real elephant?

1159
01:01:37,974 --> 01:01:39,558
Yes, ma'am, he sure is.

1160
01:01:39,625 --> 01:01:41,677
Thank you so much!

1161
01:01:41,745 --> 01:01:44,013
Mom! Look what I got!

1162
01:01:52,355 --> 01:01:54,606
Man, that is one hot lady.

1163
01:01:54,674 --> 01:01:58,494
If she was my woman,
I'd never let her leave the bed.

1164
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:00,863
You know
what I'm talking about.

1165
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,184
Time to go to work.

1166
01:02:05,252 --> 01:02:07,186
Hey, you like magic tricks?
I'll do one for ya.

1167
01:02:07,254 --> 01:02:09,755
Can you make yourself
disappear, Mr. Clown?

1168
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:12,925
Don't call me "Mr. Clown."

1169
01:02:12,992 --> 01:02:14,593
I happen
to be The Amazing Ted.

1170
01:02:14,661 --> 01:02:16,661
Whatever you say,
Mr. Clown.

1171
01:02:18,147 --> 01:02:19,080
Asshole.

1172
01:02:19,148 --> 01:02:20,616
You got my name right.

1173
01:02:20,684 --> 01:02:22,067
It's magic time!

1174
01:02:22,135 --> 01:02:25,954
Hey! Come on, kids.
Gather 'round.

1175
01:02:26,022 --> 01:02:27,922
Magic time!

[laughing]

1177
01:02:29,442 --> 01:02:30,876
Pay close attention,

1178
01:02:31,077 --> 01:02:35,030
because at no point
do my hands ever leave my arms.

1179
01:02:35,097 --> 01:02:36,898
Huh? [laughs]

1180
01:02:36,966 --> 01:02:40,235
Now who here likes rabbits?

1181

CLOWN: Son of a bitch!

1186
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:51,179
Hey! Hey!
You spoiled little brat!

1187
01:02:51,247 --> 01:02:53,749
Hey! That castle's
how I make my living.

Everybody get away from there
before you make it worse!

1190
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,972
Somebody get
that fat kid outta there!

1191
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,508
What the hell's he doing
in there in the first place?

1192
01:03:03,576 --> 01:03:06,545
It's for little kids.
He weighs, like, 900 pounds!

1193
01:03:06,612 --> 01:03:08,013
Let me tell you something.

1194
01:03:08,081 --> 01:03:09,364
You haven't heard
the last of this.

1195
01:03:09,432 --> 01:03:10,632
I got stuck.

1196
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:12,251
You don't think
clowns have lawyers?

1197
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:13,819
You better think again,

1198
01:03:13,887 --> 01:03:15,504
'cause you're about to be
hearing from my lawyer.

1202
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:25,547
All right, Jesus.

1203
01:03:25,615 --> 01:03:27,115
Easy, man.
Shit, don't shoot.

1204
01:03:27,183 --> 01:03:29,334
I'm so gonna hear from
the parents on this one.

1205
01:03:29,402 --> 01:03:31,286
The Amazing Ted,

1206
01:03:31,353 --> 01:03:33,038
or Mr. Clown?

1207
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:36,341
Which do you prefer
on your tombstone?

1208
01:03:36,476 --> 01:03:38,960
Oh, tombstones?
Why's he talking
about tombstones?

1209
01:03:39,028 --> 01:03:41,663
If you wanna continue
your useless existence,

1210
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:43,848
I strongly urge
a sincere apology

1211
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,283
to Miss Finnegan O'Neil.

1212
01:03:45,551 --> 01:03:47,803
Okay. Okay.

1213
01:03:47,870 --> 01:03:50,556
I'm sorry.
I'm really,
really sorry.

1214
01:03:50,623 --> 01:03:52,691
Apology accepted.

1215
01:03:52,758 --> 01:03:54,510
Now, git!

1216
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:56,678
Oh!

1217
01:03:56,745 --> 01:03:59,647
Well, birthday cake, anyone?

1218
01:03:59,715 --> 01:04:01,849
KIDS: Me!

1219
01:04:04,988 --> 01:04:06,738
Did you have fun today?

1220
01:04:06,806 --> 01:04:09,340
I liked it when
Monte shot my clown.

1221

Oh, well, baby,

1222
01:04:11,077 --> 01:04:13,312
Mr. Wildhorn didn't
really shoot your clown.

1223
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:16,949
He just, well, wanted
to get his attention.

1224
01:04:17,016 --> 01:04:18,934
Can you read me
the elephant story?

1225
01:04:19,002 --> 01:04:22,020
I don't see why not.
You ready?

1226

Ready.

1294
01:08:11,618 --> 01:08:13,384
[recording] Hi, it's Dave.

1295
01:08:13,452 --> 01:08:15,621
That's me on drums.
Leave a message.

1296
01:08:15,688 --> 01:08:16,822
[beep]

1297
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:18,223
Monte, it's Joe again.

1298
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:20,558
It's really important
you call me back.

1299
01:08:23,963 --> 01:08:26,064
Important for who?

1300
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:37,592
Willow...

1301
01:08:37,659 --> 01:08:39,311
No, thanks.

1302
01:08:39,378 --> 01:08:40,646
Come on, Willow.
This is gonna be

1303
01:08:40,713 --> 01:08:42,864
the adventure
of a lifetime.

1304
01:08:42,931 --> 01:08:43,698
Of a lifetime.

1305
01:08:44,016 --> 01:08:45,550
Finnegan is not going
to that island

1306
01:08:45,618 --> 01:08:47,319
without her big sister.

1307
01:08:48,303 --> 01:08:49,321
Fine.

1308
01:08:50,990 --> 01:08:57,328
[music]

1309
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:29,511
A swing.

1310
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:31,813
Will you push me, Willow?

1311
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,648
Sure, Carl. Hop on.

1312
01:09:37,537 --> 01:09:39,087
Whee-hee!

1313
01:09:40,673 --> 01:09:41,640
Whoo!

1314
01:09:41,874 --> 01:09:43,658
Higher. Whee-hee.

1315
01:09:44,726 --> 01:09:46,328
Hang on!

1316
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:47,546
Push harder.

1317
01:09:47,613 --> 01:09:49,564
Fun?
Yeah!

1318
01:09:49,632 --> 01:09:51,633
Oh!

1319
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:56,104
I think I'm drowning!

1320
01:09:56,171 --> 01:09:59,908
Carl! Carl, it's shallow.
Just stand up.

1321
01:09:59,976 --> 01:10:01,326
Help me!

1322
01:10:01,977 --> 01:10:03,961
Carl, it's shallow.

1323
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:06,531
You're not drowning.

1324
01:10:10,903 --> 01:10:12,670
That was close.

1325
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,665
Whoa.

1326
01:10:42,885 --> 01:10:44,352
FLORA:
What is it, Finn?

1327
01:10:44,419 --> 01:10:47,488
It's a lunchbox.
I found it on the island.

1328
01:10:47,556 --> 01:10:48,723
What's inside?

1329
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:49,758
I haven't
opened it yet.

1330
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:51,309
Why not?

1331
01:10:51,377 --> 01:10:53,144
Because there might not
be anything good in it.

1332
01:10:53,212 --> 01:10:55,146
This way, I can think
there's something good
even if there's not.

1333
01:10:55,214 --> 01:10:57,048
Do you know how stupid
that sounds?

1334
01:10:57,116 --> 01:10:58,799
No. It's
like what Monte says,

1335
01:10:58,868 --> 01:11:00,134
seeing
what's not there.

1336
01:11:00,402 --> 01:11:02,754
I'll open it.
I wanna see
what is there.

1337
01:11:02,988 --> 01:11:04,422
Maybe it's money.

1338
01:11:04,490 --> 01:11:07,692
Might be a chopped
off hand, Willow Tree.

1339
01:11:07,759 --> 01:11:08,543
Don't open it!

1340
01:11:12,398 --> 01:11:14,015
Wow...
Look at all this stuff.

1341
01:11:14,083 --> 01:11:15,550
Look, it's a diary.

1342
01:11:15,685 --> 01:11:18,035
"Property
of Charlotte Reilly,
Seventh Grade."

1343
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:19,771
Who's that?

1344
01:11:19,839 --> 01:11:21,339
That's Mama!

1345
01:11:21,406 --> 01:11:22,941
Probably everything
we wanna know about her

1346
01:11:23,008 --> 01:11:24,909
when she was
a kid is in here.

1347
01:11:24,977 --> 01:11:26,578
What do we wanna
know about her?

1348
01:11:26,646 --> 01:11:28,279
We should probably
give it back to her.

1349
01:11:28,347 --> 01:11:29,881
I think she'd
want it back.

1350
01:11:30,149 --> 01:11:32,734
We should make
her a sandwich.

1351
01:12:07,019 --> 01:12:08,319
Lovely day, Mr. Wildhorn.

1352
01:12:08,521 --> 01:12:10,021
Yes, ma'am.
It's shaping up to be

1353
01:12:10,089 --> 01:12:13,357
a considerably lovely day.

1354
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:18,780
More Tony?

1355
01:12:18,847 --> 01:12:20,264
Yes, ma'am.

1356
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:21,832
I'm sure Flora
will be delighted,

1357
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:24,435
and I will read this to her
tonight at bedtime.

1358
01:12:24,503 --> 01:12:25,603
Good.

1359
01:12:28,123 --> 01:12:29,307
Thank you.

1360
01:12:32,194 --> 01:12:34,679
Spot, that lady has a way

1361
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:37,582
of making me
sit taller in the saddle.

1362
01:12:40,136 --> 01:12:43,187
Flora, look what
Mr. Wildhorn gave me.

1363
01:12:43,255 --> 01:12:45,156
Tony the Elephant?

1364
01:12:45,224 --> 01:12:46,290
Who's Tony
the Elephant?

1365
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,109
Mr. Wildhorn wrote a story

1366
01:12:48,177 --> 01:12:49,277
for Flora's birthday.

1367
01:12:49,344 --> 01:12:51,112
He did what?

1368
01:12:51,180 --> 01:12:53,381
Read Tony, Mommy.

1369
01:12:53,515 --> 01:12:56,484
Let me see that!
No, no. We'll
read it tonight.

1370
01:12:56,551 --> 01:12:59,020
Today, I want
all of you girls
to go outside

1371
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:00,872
and play
in the fresh air.

1372
01:13:00,940 --> 01:13:03,457
Come on.
We can ride into town.

1373
01:13:05,077 --> 01:13:07,228
Monte! Monte!

1374
01:13:07,296 --> 01:13:10,782
Monte! I'm calling you out!

1375
01:13:12,418 --> 01:13:14,502
You gave up Jubal McLaws
for an elephant?

1376
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:16,320
You told me
Jubal saved your life!

1377
01:13:16,388 --> 01:13:17,255
Then you shoot him
in the back!

1378
01:13:17,323 --> 01:13:19,573
Oh, now, hold on.

1379
01:13:19,641 --> 01:13:21,842
I don't call writing
about an elephant

1380
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:23,177
shooting Jubal
in the back.

1381
01:13:23,245 --> 01:13:25,764
Jubal hasn't come
calling in years.

1382
01:13:25,831 --> 01:13:28,032
I ca-- I can't
write what's not there.

1383
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:29,968
You tell me to see
what's not there.

1384
01:13:30,035 --> 01:13:32,403
Why can't you write
what's not there?

1385
01:13:34,556 --> 01:13:36,841
You're a no-good drunk
and a liar!

1386
01:13:36,909 --> 01:13:38,376
Finnegan!

1387
01:13:38,661 --> 01:13:40,562
He's a damn
bamboozler, Willow!

1388
01:13:47,870 --> 01:13:49,371
Mr. Wildhorn?

1389
01:13:49,438 --> 01:13:52,289
My sister believes
you're something special.

1390
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,108
Are you something special?

1391
01:13:54,176 --> 01:13:58,245
Can't say that I ever
thought of myself
like that.

1392
01:13:58,313 --> 01:14:00,298
Well, you'd better be.

1393
01:14:00,366 --> 01:14:02,033
'Cause otherwise,
you don't deserve Finnegan.

1394
01:14:03,636 --> 01:14:04,936
I really hope you two make up,

1395
01:14:05,004 --> 01:14:08,372
because I'd hate to see you
lose a friend like her.

1396
01:14:20,786 --> 01:14:24,522
[voice of Monte]
"Sometimes, talking to people
wasn't easy for Tony.

to Mrs. Mouse,

[knocking on door]

1407
01:15:05,213 --> 01:15:06,514
It's open!

1408
01:15:16,057 --> 01:15:18,159
Hello, Joe.
Been expecting you.

1409
01:15:18,226 --> 01:15:21,596
You might want to
return a phone call
every once in a while,

1410
01:15:21,664 --> 01:15:23,898
especially to someone
you've known so long.

1411
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:27,252
How's the book business, Joe?

1412
01:15:27,319 --> 01:15:31,339
Nobody reads unless
they can download.

1413
01:15:31,406 --> 01:15:34,208
Why wouldn't you
want to hold a book?

1414
01:15:34,276 --> 01:15:36,377
You've got a dog!

1415
01:15:36,445 --> 01:15:39,897
Yeah, I'm dog-sitting
for the summer.

1416
01:15:39,965 --> 01:15:40,848
You seem different.

1417
01:15:42,868 --> 01:15:46,337
You're not, uh...
yourself.

1418
01:15:46,105 --> 01:15:47,421
Sober, you mean?

1419
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:50,691
Well, I've stopped before.

1420
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:52,927
And I'll probably
start up again.

1421
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:55,363
But right now,
I'm seeing things
with a clear eye.

1422
01:15:55,431 --> 01:15:57,732
And quite frankly,
I like the view.

1423
01:15:57,799 --> 01:15:59,234
What can I do
for you, Joe?

1424
01:15:59,301 --> 01:16:02,020
I've come here today
to change your life.

1425
01:16:03,589 --> 01:16:05,857
You'll collect your usual
commission for that?

1426
01:16:05,924 --> 01:16:07,258
I certainly do.

1427
01:16:07,325 --> 01:16:08,943
I brought
Luke Ford with me.

1428
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:10,144
He's waiting outside.

1429
01:16:10,212 --> 01:16:11,545
The Luke Ford?

1430
01:16:11,613 --> 01:16:13,497
The Luke Ford.

1431
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:14,933
You mind
if I invite him in?

1432
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:15,900
Be impolite not to.

1433
01:16:15,968 --> 01:16:18,652
That's what I was
thinking. Luke?

1434
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,572
Luke, why don't
you join us?

1435
01:16:22,675 --> 01:16:25,009
Come meet the great
Monte Wildhorn.

1436
01:16:27,513 --> 01:16:29,113
Sorry, for just
showing up like this,

1437
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:31,348
but Joe said it was the only way
I might get to meet you.

1438
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:32,483
I'm Luke Ford.

1439
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,819
You certainly are.

1440
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:37,521
I'm really pleased
to make your acquaintance.

1441
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:40,558
Have a seat.

1442
01:16:44,646 --> 01:16:46,747
Luke is the reason
that I've been trying

1443
01:16:46,815 --> 01:16:49,250
to get a hold of you
all summer.

1444
01:16:49,318 --> 01:16:53,254
I know you wanted your space,
but he's been rather insistent

1445
01:16:53,322 --> 01:16:55,957
on acquiring the rights
to Jubal McLaws.

1446
01:16:56,024 --> 01:16:58,109
Is that right?

1447
01:16:58,177 --> 01:16:59,460
How about that, huh?

1448
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:01,679
Well, Jubal's
not for sale.

1449
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:05,033
Oh, come on now.
Hear him out.

1450
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:07,535
He is just trying to make you
a rich son of a bitch.

1451
01:17:07,602 --> 01:17:09,337
I'm already
a son of a bitch.

1452
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:13,607
And I don't care to
be rich, but thanks
for thinking of me.

1453
01:17:13,675 --> 01:17:15,209
This could be
a real fresh start for you.

1454
01:17:15,277 --> 01:17:17,478
Granted, you'll have to take a
sabbatical from the dog-sitting.

1455
01:17:17,546 --> 01:17:18,897
I like dog-sitting.

1456
01:17:18,964 --> 01:17:21,348
Monte, I'm a huge fan
of the old Westerns,

1457
01:17:21,416 --> 01:17:24,351
and I'm convinced that
there's still some life
left in the genre.

1458
01:17:24,620 --> 01:17:28,255
The Saga of Jubal McLaws

1459
01:17:28,323 --> 01:17:30,024
is the best Western novel
I ever read.

1460
01:17:30,091 --> 01:17:31,759
If you allow me,

1461
01:17:31,826 --> 01:17:33,744
I'd be honored to be the one
to bring Jubal to life.

1462
01:17:33,979 --> 01:17:36,014
All due respect, Mr. Ford,

1463
01:17:36,081 --> 01:17:40,051
but my late wife has already
pulled off that miracle.

1464
01:17:40,185 --> 01:17:43,237
Then consider your readership--
this movie gets produced,

1465
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:45,607
they'll increase
a thousand fold.

1466
01:17:45,674 --> 01:17:47,441
Isn't that what
you always wanted?

1467
01:17:47,509 --> 01:17:48,792
I thought it was.

1468
01:17:50,763 --> 01:17:53,197
Mr. Ford, I appreciate
your taking the time

1469
01:17:53,265 --> 01:17:55,700
to come out here,
I really do.

1470
01:17:55,768 --> 01:17:59,103
If ever there was a man
to play Jubal, you'd be him.

1471
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:02,790
But right now,
I'm in a pretty good...

1472
01:18:06,161 --> 01:18:10,865
Most times, real life
doesn't measure up
to what's in our heads,

1473
01:18:10,933 --> 01:18:14,335
but every now and then,
it comes pretty close.

1474
01:18:14,403 --> 01:18:18,923
You happened
to catch me in one
of those rarefied moments.

1475
01:18:18,991 --> 01:18:21,492
So if it's
all the same to you,

1476
01:18:21,560 --> 01:18:24,178
I'll stick with real life
for a spell.

1477
01:18:26,031 --> 01:18:28,182
You're making a big mistake,
and I gotta tell you,

1478
01:18:28,249 --> 01:18:29,550
this could be your last chance.

1479
01:18:29,785 --> 01:18:31,835
I don't believe
in last chances, Joe.

1480
01:18:31,904 --> 01:18:33,137
I've had too many of them.

1481
01:18:33,205 --> 01:18:34,822
Monte!
Joe...

1482
01:18:34,889 --> 01:18:36,040
meeting's over.

1483
01:18:41,914 --> 01:18:43,347
It's real nice
meeting you.

1484

[piano playing]

1485
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:49,320
That's pretty.

1486
01:18:49,387 --> 01:18:51,138
It's Mrs. O'Neil,

1487
01:18:51,206 --> 01:18:52,490
next door.

1488
01:18:52,558 --> 01:18:54,325
Real fine lady.

1489
01:18:55,810 --> 01:18:59,130
Right now,
she's talking to me.

1490
01:18:59,197 --> 01:19:00,264
And if you don't mind,

1491
01:19:00,332 --> 01:19:01,999
it's a personal
conversation.

1492
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:05,719
Mr. Wildhorn,

1493
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:08,672
it's a pleasure
not doing business with you.

1494
01:19:15,814 --> 01:19:18,199
How much longer
are you here?

1495
01:19:18,266 --> 01:19:19,434
Couple of weeks.

1496
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:22,403
Fixed all right for cash?

1497
01:19:22,470 --> 01:19:24,255
Same as always.

1498
01:19:24,323 --> 01:19:25,006
That's what I thought.

1499
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:26,891
No, thanks, Joe.

1500
01:19:30,296 --> 01:19:32,062
You take care.

1501

[playing Beethoven's

CHARLOTTE:
I believe you owe me
a toast, Mr. Wildhorn.

1503
01:20:14,756 --> 01:20:19,243
Here's to you,
Mrs. O'Neil, and a face

1504
01:20:19,311 --> 01:20:22,947
that gives the moonlight
something worth shining on.

1505
01:20:30,155 --> 01:20:32,823
What do you want
out of life, Mr. Wildhorn?

1506
01:20:33,975 --> 01:20:36,444
I'd settle for
more nights like this.

1507
01:20:38,714 --> 01:20:41,281
I told my girls
that one of the great pleasures

1508
01:20:41,349 --> 01:20:44,284
life has to offer is their
own search after the heart.

1509
01:20:46,071 --> 01:20:47,205
Yes, ma'am.

1510
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:52,125
What would the woman who
captures your heart be like?

1511
01:20:52,193 --> 01:20:55,329
She'd have your way
of walking into a room.

1512
01:20:58,550 --> 01:20:59,883
How do I do that?

1513
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:06,707
It's sunny outside.
There's a light rainfall.

1514
01:21:08,376 --> 01:21:12,079
You know how it feels
when a warm breeze
comes with the rain?

1515
01:21:15,183 --> 01:21:18,052
That's how you walk
into a room.

1516
01:21:22,006 --> 01:21:23,724
That's some kind of walking
I'd have to do

1517
01:21:23,792 --> 01:21:26,059
to be worthy
of such lovely words.

1518
01:21:26,127 --> 01:21:28,629
And I'd like her
to have your ears.

1519
01:21:28,697 --> 01:21:30,631
[laughing]

1520
01:21:30,699 --> 01:21:32,299
My ears?

1521
01:21:32,367 --> 01:21:35,837
If you don't mind me
saying so, Mrs. O'Neil,

1522
01:21:35,904 --> 01:21:39,841
your ears look like they
can handle the soft whisper.

1523
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:44,562
And if you don't mind
my inquiring, Mr. Wildhorn,

1524
01:21:44,629 --> 01:21:46,863
what would the whisper be?

1525
01:21:47,099 --> 01:21:49,634
Well, it would be
different every night.

1526
01:21:53,004 --> 01:21:55,273
Maybe you could whisper
it in my ear while we dance.

1527
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:59,826
I have it on good authority
that you love to waltz.

1528
01:22:01,429 --> 01:22:02,730
And so I do.

[porch door opens]

01:22:45,357 --> 01:22:46,657
Uh, I'll be right there!

1533
01:22:46,992 --> 01:22:49,426
Just a minute.
Just a minute.

1534
01:22:49,495 --> 01:22:50,728
I'll be right there.

1535
01:22:50,796 --> 01:22:53,397
If it's too early,
I can come back.

1536
01:22:53,465 --> 01:22:54,599
Oh, no, no, no.

1537
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:57,117
Not at all. Not at all.

1538
01:22:59,287 --> 01:23:03,757
Ah, Mrs. O'Neil.
What a pleasant surprise.

1539
01:23:03,825 --> 01:23:04,992
What can I do for you?

1540
01:23:05,059 --> 01:23:06,861
I have something
of a favor to ask you

1541
01:23:06,928 --> 01:23:08,646
if it wouldn't be too
much of an imposition.

1542
01:23:08,714 --> 01:23:12,499
After the way you played
the piano last night,
no favor is too big.

1543
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:13,984
Thank you.

1544
01:23:14,052 --> 01:23:15,286
It's just that
I have to go into the city

1545
01:23:15,353 --> 01:23:17,337
for the day
to meet with the lawyers.

1546

Jack and I have
a few final things
to work out.

1547
01:23:20,058 --> 01:23:22,810
I was wondering
if you might

1548
01:23:22,877 --> 01:23:24,678
stay with the girls
until I get back.

1549
01:23:24,947 --> 01:23:27,031
It shouldn't be too late.

1550
01:23:29,952 --> 01:23:31,635
You want me to baby-sit?

1551
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:34,004
If you wouldn't mind.

1552
01:23:37,692 --> 01:23:39,559
No, no.

1553
01:23:39,628 --> 01:23:41,294
No, I accept the challenge.

1554
01:23:41,362 --> 01:23:44,815
Wonderful. Thank you,
Mr. Wildhorn.

1555

There's a casserole
in the fridge for dinner.

the girls have my cell number.

Okay, now, I should be home
before you go to bed,

1558
01:23:56,844 --> 01:23:59,813
but Mr. Wildhorn
agreed to stay with you.

1559
01:23:59,881 --> 01:24:01,949
It's okay, Mom.
I can take care
of everything.

1560
01:24:02,016 --> 01:24:04,068
Yeah, Mom.
We don't need any help.

1561

Willow can watch us.

1562

I know, this is just in case.

And I expect you to behave
like ladies while I'm gone.

Oh, good luck.

Oh, don't worry about us.

Is Dad gonna be there?

1575
01:25:02,861 --> 01:25:05,996
Or is it
just the lawyers?

1576
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:08,332
Dad will be there.

1577
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:12,303
Will you say
hello for me?

1578
01:25:12,370 --> 01:25:14,355
Of course.

I love you, too.

Come on, Flora!
Jump.

1582
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:50,173
Whoo!

1583
01:26:06,491 --> 01:26:08,776
That's quite an arm
you got there.

1584
01:26:13,581 --> 01:26:15,466
You ever play any ball?

1585
01:26:23,709 --> 01:26:25,776
When I was 17 years old,

1586
01:26:25,843 --> 01:26:28,879
I could throw a baseball
90 miles an hour.

1587
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:31,548
Had a real live arm.

1588
01:26:33,218 --> 01:26:34,835
Got me
a minor league contract

1589
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:38,105
for the St. Louis Cardinals.

1590
01:26:38,173 --> 01:26:40,640
I played eight years
with the Memphis Chickasaws

1591
01:26:40,708 --> 01:26:42,943
and the Portland Beavers.

1592
01:26:43,011 --> 01:26:46,113
Double A, Triple A.

1593
01:26:46,181 --> 01:26:50,301
Even worked my way up
to the bigs at the end
of a couple of seasons.

1594
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:56,206
One summer day,
we were playing a doubleheader.

1595
01:26:58,009 --> 01:26:59,510
I was pitching the opener.

1596
01:27:01,312 --> 01:27:05,015
First batter steps into the box.

1597
01:27:05,083 --> 01:27:07,817
I leaned in to get the sign,

1598
01:27:07,885 --> 01:27:09,719
and out of the corner of my eye,

1599
01:27:09,787 --> 01:27:14,691
I saw the most beautiful girl
I'd ever seen in my life.

1600
01:27:16,410 --> 01:27:20,464
She takes a seat right
behind the catcher,

1601
01:27:20,532 --> 01:27:23,967
and I can't
take my eyes off her.

1602
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:26,937
I was knocked out
in the first inning.

1603
01:27:27,005 --> 01:27:30,791
But it was
worth it.

1604
01:27:30,859 --> 01:27:33,110
Her name was Mary,

1605
01:27:33,177 --> 01:27:36,213
and we were married
eight months later.

1606
01:27:36,415 --> 01:27:40,217
She wanted to have
a lot of kids.

1607
01:27:40,284 --> 01:27:44,622
I was all right
with that.

1608
01:27:44,689 --> 01:27:47,173
Two days before
my 25th birthday,

1609
01:27:47,241 --> 01:27:49,710
I got a call from the Cardinals.

1610
01:27:49,777 --> 01:27:51,077
They needed a new starter.

1611
01:27:53,548 --> 01:27:56,016
I was on my way home
from the ballpark

1612
01:27:56,083 --> 01:27:57,518
to tell Mary the good news...

1613
01:27:58,686 --> 01:28:00,754
when a drunk driver
ran a red light...

1614
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:05,325
I ended up in this chair.

1615
01:28:09,630 --> 01:28:13,066
I was sure Mary would leave me.

1616
01:28:13,134 --> 01:28:15,569
There were times
when I almost wished she would.

1617
01:28:18,139 --> 01:28:20,440
But she never gave up on me.

1618
01:28:22,343 --> 01:28:24,110
She used to tell me,

1619
01:28:24,178 --> 01:28:26,747
one door closes,
another one opens.

1620
01:28:28,332 --> 01:28:31,234
I didn't buy into it
until one day I looked up

1621
01:28:31,302 --> 01:28:33,870
and there was Jubal McLaws,

1622
01:28:33,938 --> 01:28:38,742
a half smile on his face,
staring right back at me.

1623
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:45,799
Jubal and Mary
gave me my life back.

1624
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:52,573
Six years ago, Mary died...

1625
01:28:55,377 --> 01:28:56,810
and Jubal went with her.

1626
01:28:58,846 --> 01:29:01,014
All doors closed,

1627
01:29:01,082 --> 01:29:02,383
bolted shut.

1628
01:29:04,753 --> 01:29:07,688
Until one day,

1629
01:29:07,756 --> 01:29:10,557
a nine year-old girl
named Finnegan O'Neil

1630
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:16,330
showed up at my door
and gave me back my legs.

1631
01:29:23,171 --> 01:29:24,604
How did I do that?

1632
01:29:27,075 --> 01:29:29,843
By believing with me.

1633
01:29:29,911 --> 01:29:32,880
That's how I was able
to dance in the moonlight.

1634
01:29:35,817 --> 01:29:36,917
You danced?

1635
01:29:36,985 --> 01:29:40,303
In my mind, I sure did.

1636
01:29:47,312 --> 01:29:48,645
Can't they fix you?

1637
01:29:49,881 --> 01:29:51,531
No, Finn, they can't.

1638
01:29:56,921 --> 01:29:58,855
Maybe you'll get a miracle.

1639
01:30:00,725 --> 01:30:05,562
The way I see it,
I already got my miracle.

1640
01:30:12,604 --> 01:30:14,371
Okay, so first you
go to "contacts."

1641
01:30:14,438 --> 01:30:15,705
What's "contacts"?

1642
01:30:15,774 --> 01:30:17,707
It's the thing
that looks like a book.

1643
01:30:17,776 --> 01:30:19,276
I see a clock.

1644
01:30:19,343 --> 01:30:20,360
It's next to
the clock, see?

1645
01:30:20,428 --> 01:30:22,262
All right.
How do I get there?

1646
01:30:22,329 --> 01:30:23,063
See the little ball
in the middle?

1647
01:30:23,130 --> 01:30:24,148
Yeah.

1648
01:30:24,215 --> 01:30:26,166
Roll it.
Roll it.

1649
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:27,234
With your thumb.

1650
01:30:27,302 --> 01:30:29,603
With my thumb, okay.

1651
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,139
Oh! There it is.
Now what?

1652
01:30:32,206 --> 01:30:33,974
[together] Press it.

1653
01:30:35,994 --> 01:30:37,795
Now it's showing me the time.

1654
01:30:37,862 --> 01:30:39,045
That's because you rolled it
while pressing it.

1655
01:30:39,113 --> 01:30:40,330
Go back one.

1656
01:30:40,398 --> 01:30:42,532
Ah, I don't believe I will.

1657
01:30:42,601 --> 01:30:45,636
Like I stated at the outset,
it's not for me.

1658
01:30:45,704 --> 01:30:49,056
Now, who can I interest
in a Mr. Pibb?

1659
01:30:49,124 --> 01:30:50,507
[together] Me.

1660
01:30:50,575 --> 01:30:51,909
Come on.

1661
01:30:55,780 --> 01:31:00,467
Uh... you let me know
if I'm doing something wrong.

1662
01:31:00,535 --> 01:31:04,004
I never put kids
to bed before.

1663
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:05,271
We'll help you, Monte.

1664
01:31:05,339 --> 01:31:07,407
Oh...

1665
01:31:07,475 --> 01:31:09,776
Shouldn't Mama be home now?

1666
01:31:09,843 --> 01:31:10,828
She just texted me.

1667
01:31:10,895 --> 01:31:12,646
She'll be home
in a couple of hours.

1668
01:31:17,818 --> 01:31:18,952
Well, now.

1669
01:31:24,108 --> 01:31:25,942
All right, then...

1670
01:31:28,913 --> 01:31:29,946
get some shuteye.

1671
01:31:47,865 --> 01:31:50,100
We're in Dog Dave's bed.

1672
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:52,702
[giggling]

1673
01:32:01,446 --> 01:32:03,880
I couldn't agree more.

1674
01:32:03,948 --> 01:32:06,967
A night like this
certainly puts you in the mood.

1675
01:32:08,536 --> 01:32:10,503
Good evening,
Mr. Wildhorn.

1676
01:32:10,571 --> 01:32:12,188
I'm sorry
I'm so late.

1677
01:32:12,256 --> 01:32:13,590
Oh, that's all right.

1678
01:32:15,059 --> 01:32:16,393
I didn't know what to do,

1679
01:32:16,461 --> 01:32:18,695
so I put the little ones
in Dog Dave's bed.

1680
01:32:18,763 --> 01:32:20,196
[laughing]

1681
01:32:20,365 --> 01:32:23,033
That'll be
all they remember
about this summer.

1682
01:32:24,735 --> 01:32:26,403
Willow fell
asleep on the couch.

1683
01:32:26,470 --> 01:32:27,571
I hope they weren't
too much trouble.

1684
01:32:27,638 --> 01:32:29,639
Oh, just the opposite.

1685
01:32:32,893 --> 01:32:35,862
Well, I guess I better
take 'em off your hands.

1686
01:32:35,930 --> 01:32:37,331
I don't mind

1687
01:32:37,398 --> 01:32:39,666
if you wanna
leave 'em for the night.

1688
01:32:39,733 --> 01:32:40,950
Are you sure?

1689
01:32:41,018 --> 01:32:43,203
It'd be a shame
to wake 'em at this hour.

1690
01:32:43,471 --> 01:32:46,690
Oh. Okay. Thanks.

1691
01:32:50,512 --> 01:32:52,345
Well, uh...

1692
01:32:52,413 --> 01:32:54,848
I better be
getting back.

1693
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:58,351
If you don't feel too tired,
you might wanna sit a spell.

1694
01:32:58,419 --> 01:33:01,054
Okay.

1695
01:33:09,513 --> 01:33:11,898
I'm gonna miss this place.

1696
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:14,684
Where will you go?

1697
01:33:15,987 --> 01:33:18,454
Not quite sure.

1698
01:33:18,522 --> 01:33:21,557
I have some cat-sitting
prospects in Mexico.

1699
01:33:24,678 --> 01:33:27,280
I thought I'd try
Nueva Rosita.

1700
01:33:27,548 --> 01:33:29,666
It's a little town
I wrote about

1701
01:33:29,734 --> 01:33:32,186
when Jubal was holed up
down in those parts

1702
01:33:32,253 --> 01:33:34,588
hiding out from a posse.

1703
01:33:34,656 --> 01:33:36,756
Figured it'd be
a good place to write.

1704
01:33:36,824 --> 01:33:40,627
I'm glad you're
writing again.

1705
01:33:41,829 --> 01:33:45,732
Flora just loves
the Tony stories.

1706
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:49,686
So you said.
What about you?

1707
01:33:53,340 --> 01:33:55,776
[sighing]

1708
01:33:55,843 --> 01:33:59,078
I'm greatly fond of them
as well.

1709
01:34:06,671 --> 01:34:08,906
This has been
a wonderful summer.

1710
01:34:11,609 --> 01:34:16,813
There's only one thing
that I know I'll wish
I had done.

1711
01:34:18,216 --> 01:34:19,649
What's that?

1712
01:34:21,719 --> 01:34:24,620
Had our waltz
in the moonlight.

1713
01:34:32,647 --> 01:34:34,481
I know what you mean.

1714
01:34:42,039 --> 01:34:43,606
Sure you don't want
me to take the girls?

1715
01:34:43,674 --> 01:34:45,158
I mean, where
are you gonna sleep?

1716
01:34:45,226 --> 01:34:48,979
Ah, sleeping under the stars
has never been a hardship.

1717
01:34:51,099 --> 01:34:52,132
Well...

1718
01:34:54,736 --> 01:34:57,237
I guess I'll just come back
and get them in the morning.

1719
01:34:59,023 --> 01:35:01,124
Good night, Mrs. O'Neil.

1720
01:35:11,518 --> 01:35:13,053
Good night,
Mr. Wildhorn.

1721
01:35:31,255 --> 01:35:33,190
[snoring]

1722
01:35:36,327 --> 01:35:38,461
He's sleeping.

1723
01:35:44,802 --> 01:35:46,285
[door banging]

1724
01:35:46,354 --> 01:35:47,854
[Spot barking]

1725
01:35:47,921 --> 01:35:51,207
Sorry, Monte.
We were sneaking out.

1726
01:35:51,276 --> 01:35:52,842
We want to surprise Mama.

1727
01:35:52,910 --> 01:35:56,880
Well, your sneaking skills
could use a little work.

1728
01:36:05,156 --> 01:36:07,173
FLORA, WHISPERING: Should we
wake her up?

1729
01:36:07,241 --> 01:36:09,275
WILLOW: No, I think we
should let her sleep.

1730
01:36:09,343 --> 01:36:12,646
When do you think
she'll wake up?

1731
01:36:12,713 --> 01:36:14,931
FINN: Oh, good, you're up.

1732
01:36:17,652 --> 01:36:19,536
Oh, good morning,
girls.

1733
01:36:21,839 --> 01:36:24,641
To what do I owe
this lovely intrusion?

1734
01:36:24,709 --> 01:36:28,111
Here. This is for you.

1735
01:36:28,179 --> 01:36:31,348
Oh, wow!

1736
01:36:35,202 --> 01:36:37,337
[gasping]

1737
01:36:37,405 --> 01:36:40,390
My goodness.
Where...?

1738
01:36:41,241 --> 01:36:42,258
I found it on the island.

1739
01:36:42,526 --> 01:36:46,212
Oh...

1740
01:36:46,280 --> 01:36:48,147
Eat the sandwich.

1741
01:36:48,215 --> 01:36:51,017
I haven't
seen this since--

1742
01:36:51,085 --> 01:36:52,436
Eat the sandwich.

1743
01:36:52,503 --> 01:36:54,287
Okay.

1744
01:36:57,158 --> 01:36:58,724
Mmm...

1745
01:36:58,792 --> 01:37:00,293
Do you like it?

1746
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,495
I love it.

1747
01:37:01,562 --> 01:37:03,796
Come here.
Come here, you three.

1748
01:37:11,822 --> 01:37:14,290
Was the alcohol
defective?

1749
01:37:14,358 --> 01:37:16,626
Changing my ways,
Mahmoud.

1750
01:37:16,694 --> 01:37:18,995
Uh, two Slim Jims, please.

1751
01:37:28,089 --> 01:37:30,924
You know, I'm leaving
tomorrow, Carl.

1752
01:37:30,992 --> 01:37:31,992
Okay.

1753
01:37:35,863 --> 01:37:37,780
Does that mean
I can't be Diego anymore?

1754
01:37:37,848 --> 01:37:41,217
No, you can be anybody
you want to be.

1755
01:37:41,285 --> 01:37:44,421
But I gotta tell you, I kind
of miss that Carl fella.

1756
01:37:44,488 --> 01:37:45,788
He's very special.

1757
01:37:47,625 --> 01:37:49,759
I'm Carl.

1758
01:37:50,694 --> 01:37:52,896
Danged if you're not.

1759
01:37:52,963 --> 01:37:55,799
I wanted to
give you something
to remember me by.

1760
01:38:02,056 --> 01:38:03,623
Fits good.

1761
01:38:03,691 --> 01:38:05,792
A little sweaty.

1762
01:38:07,394 --> 01:38:08,695
So long, partner.

1763
01:38:24,161 --> 01:38:25,462
What are you planting?

1764
01:38:25,530 --> 01:38:27,514
Pumpkins.

1765
01:38:27,581 --> 01:38:30,550
Thought it'd be nice if we grow
our own for Halloween.

1766
01:38:30,618 --> 01:38:32,151
Need some help?

1767
01:38:32,219 --> 01:38:33,303
Sure.

1768
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:41,711
What do you do?

1769
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:42,979
Well, it's easy.

1770
01:38:43,047 --> 01:38:47,016
You just dig a little hole
and drop one in.

1771
01:38:47,085 --> 01:38:49,219
I think I can
handle that.

1772
01:38:53,591 --> 01:38:55,658
How is Dad?

1773
01:38:55,726 --> 01:38:57,710
He's okay.

1774
01:38:59,546 --> 01:39:00,680
How are you doing?

1775
01:39:02,550 --> 01:39:03,616
I'm okay.

1776
01:39:03,884 --> 01:39:06,119
What about you?

1777
01:39:06,187 --> 01:39:08,421
What's going on with you,
Willow Tree?

1778
01:39:10,291 --> 01:39:13,426
I never thought about your
parents getting divorced.

1779
01:39:17,265 --> 01:39:18,782
I read your diary.

1780
01:39:22,469 --> 01:39:23,753
I kind of figured.

1781
01:39:25,640 --> 01:39:30,243
It's weird, Mom,
but the fact that
you felt so bad...

1782
01:39:31,846 --> 01:39:33,179
kind of made me
feel better.

1783
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:38,301
Is that wrong?

1784
01:39:38,369 --> 01:39:39,302
No.

1785
01:39:42,440 --> 01:39:43,640
I'm glad you read it.

1786
01:39:48,779 --> 01:39:52,898
All right, big guy,
Last Chance Saloon.

I respect consistency.

Well, just the person
I wanted to see.

1790
01:40:26,300 --> 01:40:28,501
Come on in.
I got a couple
of things for you.

1791
01:40:33,240 --> 01:40:34,407
There you go.

1793
01:40:36,276 --> 01:40:39,178
I'm afraid I'll have
to owe you the 18 cents.

1794
01:40:39,246 --> 01:40:41,747
But you taught me what
you said you would.

1795
01:40:41,815 --> 01:40:45,551
Yeah, but I wasn't
counting on you
teaching me a whole lot.

1796
01:40:45,619 --> 01:40:47,386
Go on, take it.

1797
01:40:49,807 --> 01:40:50,740
Thanks.

1798
01:40:50,808 --> 01:40:53,443
Wait. I ain't done.

What's this?

1800
01:41:02,970 --> 01:41:06,122
I don't like it
when my fans get short-changed.

1801
01:41:06,190 --> 01:41:08,958
You said you were
missing the last page
of the saga.

1802
01:41:09,026 --> 01:41:12,411
That's what I meant to write
in the first place.

1803

Wow...

1804
01:41:16,216 --> 01:41:18,518
Now you have
to promise me something.

1805
01:41:18,585 --> 01:41:20,219
Okay.

1806
01:41:20,287 --> 01:41:24,908
Never stop looking
for what's not there.

1807
01:41:27,311 --> 01:41:29,278
I promise.

1808
01:41:29,346 --> 01:41:32,882
Good.

1809
01:41:32,950 --> 01:41:34,684
I'm leaving
early in the morning,

1810
01:41:34,752 --> 01:41:40,323
so we'd best say
our proper good-byes
here and now.

Do you have to go?

If I ever had me
a little girl...

1813

I guess I'd want her to be you.

Ah...
I think it's about time

we dispensed
with the formalities.

It's nice to be
on a first-name basis.

Well, I think
that's everything.

But I'll give it
one last look.

Do you like it?

Oh... it's a surprisingly
accurate rendering,

and I shall cherish it.

you owe me 18 cents.

go up and talk to him?

to master this e-mail

I've been pretty busy lately.

I'm happy to report
that I've found

the perfect place
to write.

I went ahead and bought it.

Oh, I should say
Jubal bought it.
