<i>What's the emergency?</i>

6
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:32,022
There's been a suicide.

7

<i>Who's the victim?</i>

8
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:37,728
I am.

9
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:49,274
<i>In seven days,</i>

<i>And in seven seconds...</i>

11
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,984
<i>...I shattered mine.</i>

12
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:58,572
-<i>I can have four new fillets overnight.</i>
-Oh, no. No, thank you.

13
00:02:58,784 --> 00:03:00,911
What is your name again? Ezra?
Is that right?

14
00:03:01,119 --> 00:03:03,849
Yes, sir. I'II just need
your first and Iast name...

15
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:06,320
-...so I can caII up your account.
-<i>You know what?</i>

16
00:03:06,525 --> 00:03:10,427
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra. I think
I'm gonna maiI you the meat back...

17
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:13,962
...so you can see firsthand the type
of dog food that you're peddIing.

18
00:03:14,166 --> 00:03:17,658
That won't be necessary, sir.

19
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:20,633
So how about we just start
with your Iast name?

20
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,033
Thomas.

21
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,105
And don't even get me started
on the pork.

22
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:26,470
-Have you tried the pork?
-<i>Well, no, sir.</i>

23
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:30,170
I'm not much of a meat eater myseIf,
but I hear reaIIy great things...

24
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:31,542
...about the pork.

25
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,981
-Oh, so you don't eat pork at aII?
-No, sir.

26
00:03:35,187 --> 00:03:38,987
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?

27
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:45,653
WeII, can we--?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?

28
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:48,699
Ben.

29
00:03:53,672 --> 00:03:55,003
HoId on, what was that voice?

30
00:03:55,207 --> 00:03:58,540
I don't-- I don't have an order
for a Ben Thomas.

31
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:01,144
Ezra, what was that voice?

32
00:04:01,346 --> 00:04:03,837
-What voice?
-Are you bIind?

33
00:04:04,049 --> 00:04:06,574
-Excuse me?
-<i>You're kidding me.</i>

34
00:04:06,785 --> 00:04:11,984
A bIind beef saIesman
who doesn't eat meat.

35
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:16,823
<i>Now, that</i>-- <i>That is rich.</i>
<i>That is rich.</i>

Have you ever had sex, Ezra?

37
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:23,500
Did Lawrence in Accounting
put you up to this?

38
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:26,967
Because somehow I can't imagine
the bIind, vegan...

39
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:29,402
<i>...beef salesman having sex.</i>

40
00:04:29,608 --> 00:04:32,873
-Listen, I'm trying to heIp you, sir.
-<i>You're trying to help me?</i>

41
00:04:33,078 --> 00:04:35,911
The bIind beef saIesman
is trying to heIp me?

42
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:39,106
I'm actuaIIy starting to feeI
pretty bad for you, Ezra.

43
00:04:39,317 --> 00:04:43,447
Because I Iook at my Iife, and it is
surrounded by so much beauty...

44
00:04:43,655 --> 00:04:46,818
<i>...and you can't see shit.</i>

45
00:04:47,025 --> 00:04:48,720
Is that fair?

46
00:04:48,927 --> 00:04:50,554
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

47
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:53,026
Do you even know
what coIor the ocean is?

48
00:04:53,832 --> 00:04:55,459
<i>Do you?</i>

49
00:04:55,967 --> 00:04:58,401
-It's bIue, sir.

You know, it is reaIIy important
I speak to her for just a moment.

So if there is one thing
that I have Iearned...

85
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:10,203
...and you aII shouId remember
about winning these contracts:

86
00:11:10,408 --> 00:11:14,105
Three steps. First, teII them
what you're gonna teII them.

87
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:16,280
Step two, you teII them.

88

Step three,
teII them what you toId them.

89
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:22,414
We are gonna cIose
by reminding them...

90
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,112
...that oId girI has a 3-percent better
impuIse from sea IeveI to vacuum...

91
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:30,283
...and if they pass on that, quite
frankIy, they deserve another Sputnik.

92
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:37,525
Now, if you wiII excuse me...

I was in the neighborhood. I thought
I'd stop by, save you the drive.

00:15:44,949 --> 00:15:47,110
Things aren't Iooking
very promising for me.

151
00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:52,546
Look...

152
00:15:52,757 --> 00:15:54,850
...I have a bonus coming in January.

153
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:58,324
I just reaIIy need
this six-month extension.

154
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:03,060
ReaIIy, I mean, I am doing the very
best I can here, I promise you.

155
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:16,177
I'm gonna show myseIf out.

156
00:16:16,848 --> 00:16:17,837
I'II be in touch.

157
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:19,983
WeII, thank you. I appreciate it.

158
00:16:20,184 --> 00:16:22,652
I mean, this way
everybody wins, right?

159
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,259
HeIIo.

160
00:16:44,041 --> 00:16:45,838
My name is Ben.

161
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:51,713
I totaIIy understand
if you don't wanna speak to me either.

162
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:56,046
But I wouId reaIIy Iike
to just have a moment of your time.

163
00:17:15,306 --> 00:17:20,300
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.

164
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:29,108
It is within my power to drasticaIIy
change his circumstances.

165
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:34,983
But I don't wanna give that man
a gift that he doesn't deserve.

166
00:17:37,962 --> 00:17:42,331
I need you to teII me
whether or not he is a good person.

167
00:18:09,961 --> 00:18:12,657
''The drug he gives me...

168
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:16,792
...makes me dizzy.

169
00:18:20,171 --> 00:18:22,332
I want a new one.''

170
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,737
WeII, that sounds
very reasonabIe, Inez.

171
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:28,205
What eIse?

172
00:18:30,881 --> 00:18:32,348
You can trust me.

173
00:18:36,253 --> 00:18:37,811
What eIse, Inez?

174
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:56,168
He's punishing you?

175
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:59,203
How is he punishing you?

176
00:19:03,814 --> 00:19:06,248
How is he punishing you, Inez?

177
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,498
Ben?

178
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,740
-Hey, Ben, where you going?
-Where's the washroom?

179
00:19:34,945 --> 00:19:37,106
To the right. Is there a probIem?

180
00:19:37,314 --> 00:19:40,112
-Give her a bath, right now.
-AbsoIuteIy.

181
00:19:40,317 --> 00:19:43,480
Thank you. Thank you.

182
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,115
You have the wrong
impression here.

183
00:19:47,324 --> 00:19:49,053
I'm gonna stop by
from time to time...

184
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,558
...make sure you're showing
these peopIe some respect.

185
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:53,957
Look, this is
a misunderstanding, okay?

186
00:19:54,165 --> 00:19:56,258
You don't treat peopIe Iike that.

187
00:19:56,467 --> 00:19:58,059
Let me expIain, okay, Ben?

188
00:19:58,269 --> 00:20:00,203
-And I'm not giving you an extension.
-Ben!

189
00:20:00,404 --> 00:20:02,497
I'm not giving you anything.

190
00:20:03,307 --> 00:20:05,741
I aImost beIieved you,
you son of a bitch.

191
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:08,275
I aImost beIieved.

192
00:20:17,621 --> 00:20:19,555
Okay. Grip and rip.

193
00:20:19,757 --> 00:20:23,887
This time it's gonna be
a Iot different.

194
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:27,261
Hey.

195
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:30,894
-Hey, MicheIIe.
-Hey.

196
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:35,098
-Good to see you.
-You too.

197
00:20:35,306 --> 00:20:36,398
-How are you?
-I'm good.

198
00:20:36,607 --> 00:20:38,734
-Hey, man.
-Hey. What are you doing here?

199
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:42,845
Just coming to make sure that she
is stiII kicking your ass at everything.

200
00:20:43,047 --> 00:20:44,947
And I am.

201
00:20:45,683 --> 00:20:47,810
-Can we have a sec, hon?
-Yeah.

202
00:20:48,018 --> 00:20:49,952
AII right.

203
00:20:50,387 --> 00:20:51,513
You okay?

204
00:20:51,722 --> 00:20:56,250
Yeah, I'm good. You said you were
gonna caII me on the 1 5th.

205
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,859
-Today is the 1 9th.
-I know.

206
00:20:58,062 --> 00:21:01,395
Doctor didn't have the resuIts,
so I had no information to give you.

207
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,464
StiII, you shouId caII me.

208
00:21:03,667 --> 00:21:06,261
-Yeah, I know. Yes, I know.
-We're stiII friends. Right?

209
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,337
Yeah. I'm just....

210
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,998
I'm doing some souI-searching,
you know?

211
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:16,335
Don't do that.

212
00:21:17,014 --> 00:21:18,106
-We have a pIan.
-I know.

213
00:21:18,315 --> 00:21:20,613
-Do what you promised me.
-I wiII.

214
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:22,945
You know, they rent cIubs
up at the cIubhouse.

215
00:21:23,154 --> 00:21:24,883
I'm weII aware of that.

216
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,320
I think I'm gonna keep my ass
unkicked today.

217
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,337
Were you Iooking at him,
or were you Iooking at me?

218
00:22:51,075 --> 00:22:53,373
ActuaIIy, I was just sitting here.

219
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:55,772
Am I doing it wrong?

220
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:59,280
I think I saw you
in the eIevator the other day.

221
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,417
Oh, yes.

222
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:06,623
ActuaIIy, you are being audited.

223
00:23:08,425 --> 00:23:09,824
My name is Ben Thomas.

224
00:23:10,027 --> 00:23:14,123
I'm with the IRS,
and you owe the government...

225
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:17,789
...$56, 2 40.1 9.

226
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,731
I know.

227
00:23:19,937 --> 00:23:22,337
And now you get me.

228
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:25,407
WouId you have a seat, pIease,
Miss Posa?

229
00:23:27,044 --> 00:23:30,844
So I've been Iooking over
the income statements...

230
00:23:31,048 --> 00:23:34,506
...from the Iast three years.

231
00:23:34,718 --> 00:23:36,185
-2005--
-Were--?

232
00:23:37,655 --> 00:23:40,283
Were you in my room
the other night?

233
00:23:41,859 --> 00:23:46,421
No, ma'am, I was not
in your room the other night.

234
00:23:47,731 --> 00:23:51,394
That's not exactIy IRS protocoI.

235
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:53,934
So I've been Iooking over
'05, '06 and '0 7.

236
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:58,131
There seems to be quite a disparity
between what you cIaimed and--

237
00:23:58,342 --> 00:23:59,604
Mr. Thomas?

238
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:04,614
I just got discharged.

239
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:07,113
So, you know,
unIess you're gonna, Iike...

240
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:09,411
...hauI me off
to some IRS jaiI or something...

241
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,953
...I'd reaIIy Iike to get home now.

242
00:24:13,157 --> 00:24:17,116
-Oh, sure. No probIem.
-Okay.

243
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:19,757
I'II be in touch.

244
00:25:00,237 --> 00:25:03,570
WeIcome to the TraveI Inn.
Can I heIp you?

245
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:05,105
I need a room.

246
00:25:05,309 --> 00:25:06,742
How many hours?

247
00:25:09,146 --> 00:25:11,080
About two weeks.

248
00:25:42,546 --> 00:25:45,140
CIear it! That's it, that's it!

249
00:25:45,716 --> 00:25:48,207
AII right, come on! <i>Vamos,</i> Manny!

250
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:51,786
AII right, aII right. That's it, that's it.

251
00:25:52,923 --> 00:25:54,481
Hey!

252
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,624
-What you want?
-Break it up!

253
00:25:57,828 --> 00:26:00,160
-You want some of this?
-Get off! Get off!

254
00:26:00,364 --> 00:26:02,662
Hey, Rico, knock it off!

255
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:05,130
Somebody wanna remind Rico
where we are?

256
00:26:05,335 --> 00:26:07,166
The sanctuary, coach!

257
00:26:07,371 --> 00:26:10,204
-I can't hear you.
-The sanctuary, coach!

258
00:26:10,407 --> 00:26:13,103
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.

259
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,904
Now give me 20 starts and stops.

260
00:26:16,513 --> 00:26:17,912
<i>Hello, this is Emily Posa.</i>

261
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:21,209
<i>I'm not home right now,</i>
<i>but please leave a message...</i>

262
00:26:21,418 --> 00:26:25,115
<i>...and I'll call you back</i>

263
00:26:25,322 --> 00:26:27,984
<i>Hi, my name is Susan Nall.</i>
<i>I'm calling because a friend...</i>

264
00:26:28,192 --> 00:26:31,628
<i>...told me you do letterpress</i>
<i>invitations, and I was wondering</i>--

265
00:26:31,829 --> 00:26:34,423
HeIIo? Hi, this is EmiIy.

266
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:40,597
Yep, I do wedding invitations.

267
00:26:40,804 --> 00:26:43,204
I'm not abIe to take any requests,
though, right now.

268
00:26:43,774 --> 00:26:46,572
I know someone nearby who does it.

269
00:26:46,777 --> 00:26:50,713
She's not as good as I am,
but her prices are very--

270
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:54,150
HeIIo?

271
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:02,715
Duke?

272
00:27:06,864 --> 00:27:08,354
Duke.

273
00:27:08,565 --> 00:27:10,294
We're out here.

274
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:19,006
HeIIo, Miss Posa.

275
00:27:19,843 --> 00:27:21,367
What are you doing here?

276
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:23,068
Oh, I came to see you.

277
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,612
Don't you peopIe ever caII ahead?

278
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:28,685
You peopIe tend to try
to hide things.

279
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:30,353
Is that meat?

280
00:27:30,554 --> 00:27:32,818
No! No, no.

281
00:27:33,023 --> 00:27:35,355
No. No meat. No.

282
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,893
-WeII, he was reaIIy enjoying it.
-He eats steamed broccoIi and tofu.

283
00:27:40,097 --> 00:27:42,588
-Why?
-He's a vegetarian.

284
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,063
-He is a vegetarian?
-Yes.

285
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,431
WeII, that sucks.

286
00:27:48,639 --> 00:27:52,166
Hey, can we taIk?
Do you have a moment?

287
00:27:52,709 --> 00:27:54,142
No.

288
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:56,812
ActuaIIy, I have to take Duke
for a waIk.

289
00:27:57,447 --> 00:28:01,884
No probIem. I'II go with you,
if you don't mind.

290
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,250
-So--
-Hey, hey.

291
00:28:05,455 --> 00:28:06,945
Hey.

292
00:28:07,157 --> 00:28:12,993
So I've been Iooking over
2005, 2006 and 200 7.

293
00:28:13,197 --> 00:28:14,858
Now--

294
00:28:15,065 --> 00:28:16,532
I'm Iistening.

295
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:20,635
-Can I get him for you?
-Nope. I got him.

296
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:23,772
Let me get him. Let me get him.
Let me get him.

297
00:28:23,974 --> 00:28:25,771
-You aII right?
-Yes.

298
00:28:26,944 --> 00:28:28,809
Whoa, sorry. Whoa, not these.

299
00:28:29,012 --> 00:28:33,346
-That's okay. Watch--
-No, no. HeeI, heeI, heeI.

300
00:28:34,017 --> 00:28:37,009
Yeah, maybe we shouIdn't
feed him meat.

301
00:28:37,221 --> 00:28:39,212
So I've been Iooking over--

302
00:28:41,391 --> 00:28:44,155
-Yeah, maybe we can do this Iater.
-Yeah.

303
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:50,965
So you cook it aII
ahead of time, I see.

304
00:28:51,168 --> 00:28:54,331
No, actuaIIy. I can't remember
the Iast time I cooked.

305
00:28:54,538 --> 00:28:59,635
This is my sister's way
of Iooking out for me from afar.

306
00:28:59,843 --> 00:29:01,367
Do you have any sibIings?

307
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:04,445
Yes, one brother.

308
00:29:04,648 --> 00:29:06,741
He's a-- He's a good egg.

309
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,748
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.

310
00:29:10,921 --> 00:29:13,617
Are you receiving income
from any source...

311
00:29:13,824 --> 00:29:16,088
...that the government
is currentIy unaware of?

312
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:20,457
WeII, IateIy I've been taking
to diving in IocaI wishing weIIs, so....

313
00:29:20,664 --> 00:29:23,895
I mean, but it's just occasionaI dimes
here and there...

314
00:29:24,101 --> 00:29:25,830
...or, once in a whiIe, a quarter.

315
00:29:27,137 --> 00:29:29,298
No, actuaIIy...

316
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:33,033
...I had to refinance this pIace
to pay my past-due medicaI biIIs.

317
00:29:33,944 --> 00:29:39,143
I've been informed that you suffer
from congenitaI heart faiIure.

318
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:43,843
Yes. Did you gather that
whiIe staIking me at the hospitaI?

319
00:29:44,321 --> 00:29:46,289
No, I....

320
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:51,223
You're currentIy Status 2,
which means you're sick enough...

321
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,726
...to be on the nationaI UNOS
waiting Iist...

322
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:56,865
...but not sick enough to be admitted
into the hospitaI...

323
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,262
...and pIaced on Status 1 .

324
00:29:59,469 --> 00:30:03,667
So basicaIIy, if your heart starts to faiI
quickIy and no donor can be Iocated...

325
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:07,075
...you're screwed.

326
00:30:09,012 --> 00:30:12,448
Is it true that you said...

327
00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:15,584
...that you do not beIieve
that you even deserve a heart...

328
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:20,951
...because your Iife is unremarkabIe
in every way?

329
00:30:26,096 --> 00:30:27,723
I'm sorry.

330
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:38,240
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.

331
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:41,605
Do you have to take any type
of sensitivity training...

332
00:30:41,812 --> 00:30:43,245
...to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?

333
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:46,780
-No, not reaIIy.
-Yeah.

334
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:51,686
So you don't consider yourseIf
a good person?

335
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:56,183
How wouId you answer that question
if I asked you the same?

336
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:05,927
''UnremarkabIe'' wouId be
an upgrade for me...

337
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:07,967
...I assure you.

338
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:16,972
I'm gonna freeze your accounts
as uncoIIectibIe untiI further notice.

339
00:31:17,581 --> 00:31:21,108
I'm sure that'II buy you
five or six months, penaIty-free.

340
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,619
Here's my card.

341
00:31:28,825 --> 00:31:32,261
If anyone from the IRS
tries to contact you...

342
00:31:32,462 --> 00:31:34,589
...you caII me immediateIy.

343
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:36,288
Okay.

344
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,028
Thank you.

345
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:41,501
Thank you.

346
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,467
Okay.

347
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,804
-Mr. Thomas?
-Yes.

348
00:32:02,926 --> 00:32:07,693
Why do I get the feeIing you're
doing me a reaIIy big favor right now?

349
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,932
Because I get the feeIing
that you reaIIy deserve it.

350
00:32:18,241 --> 00:32:19,799
AII right?

351
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:27,680
You off to...?

352
00:32:28,952 --> 00:32:31,648
You off to poIIute
someone eIse's dog now?

353
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,417
No.

354
00:32:37,627 --> 00:32:39,219
Just going home.

355
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,957
Where's that?

356
00:32:51,475 --> 00:32:53,375
Take care, EmiIy.

357
00:32:54,711 --> 00:32:56,269
You too.

358
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:33,934
-What is this thing for?
-I toId you aIready.

359
00:34:34,144 --> 00:34:36,544
And why are you bringing a fish
into your room?

360
00:34:36,746 --> 00:34:38,805
Because it's my room.

361
00:34:39,549 --> 00:34:42,450
And I don't want anyone going
into my room, understood?

362
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:45,052
WeII, I don't think you can
keep a fish in your room.

363
00:34:45,255 --> 00:34:47,314
I think I can.

364
00:34:47,524 --> 00:34:50,960
WeII, I've never had anybody
who kept a fish in their room.

365
00:34:51,161 --> 00:34:52,651
Now you do.

366
00:34:52,862 --> 00:34:54,295
Who?

367
00:34:54,497 --> 00:34:56,021
Good night.

368
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:16,040
<i>The first time I ever saw</i>
<i>a box jellyfish...</i>

369
00:35:18,121 --> 00:35:19,918
<i>...I was 1 2.</i>

370
00:35:25,362 --> 00:35:30,095
<i>Our father took us</i>
<i>to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.</i>

371
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:35,528
<i>I never forgot when he said...</i>

372
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:40,642
<i>...that it was the most</i>
<i>deadly creature on earth.</i>

373
00:35:44,381 --> 00:35:46,372
<i>To me it was just...</i>

374
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:50,309
<i>...the most beautiful thing</i>
<i>I'd ever seen.</i>

375
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:00,124
I spoke to the doctor again.

376
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,561
He's gonna send over your fiIes
in the morning.

377
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:08,667
-Is this everything?
-Yeah.

378
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,273
-Any questions?
-Same one.

379
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:13,908
WeII, same answer, then.

380
00:36:14,711 --> 00:36:17,441
You know, I was thinking Iast night
about when we were 1 4...

381
00:36:17,647 --> 00:36:20,707
...and we made our big pact.

382
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:24,080
You remember on the beach
in front of your grandparents' house...

383
00:36:24,287 --> 00:36:29,884
...we agreed that we wouId never,
never date each other's girIs?

384
00:36:31,161 --> 00:36:35,257
I remembered that that night you toId
me how much you Iiked Stacy MiIIer...

385
00:36:35,465 --> 00:36:38,263
...and that you were gonna
ask her out. And I said:

386
00:36:38,468 --> 00:36:43,132
''Hey, man. You can't.
Her and I aIready did it.''

387
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:44,931
Which we didn't, but I wanted to...

388
00:36:45,141 --> 00:36:50,010
...but she Iiked you way more
than she Iiked me, and....

389
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:52,238
So I Iied to you
because I was so jeaIous.

390
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:56,976
And I reaIized that I've been
carrying around this Iie...

391
00:36:57,187 --> 00:36:59,417
...in my heart for the Iast 25--

392
00:36:59,622 --> 00:37:00,953
Stop it!

393
00:37:02,759 --> 00:37:04,420
Stop it.

394
00:37:05,528 --> 00:37:07,621
Stay focused.

395
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:10,459
Do what you promised me.

396
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:14,864
-What, you think I'm--?
-Do what you promised me.

397
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:20,639
You think I'm gonna
Iet you down now, don't you?

398
00:37:20,844 --> 00:37:23,870
I've known you my whoIe damn Iife!

399
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,172
Okay?

400
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:28,782
This? This? This is not something
you do every day.

401
00:37:29,886 --> 00:37:33,322
Okay? This is--
This is not easy for me.

402
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:37,524
I'II make sure everything goes
as pIanned.

403
00:37:44,234 --> 00:37:45,326
Don't worry.

404
00:37:49,038 --> 00:37:50,630
Thank you.

405
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,892
Oh, my God.

406
00:38:20,103 --> 00:38:21,661
HeIIo, HoIIy.

407
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:23,796
Look at you.

408
00:38:27,744 --> 00:38:30,838
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see you.

409
00:38:31,047 --> 00:38:33,174
-ReaIIy?
-You have a minute?

410
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:35,783
Sure. Come on in.

411
00:38:35,985 --> 00:38:38,920
Here's my desk. Have a seat.

412
00:38:50,934 --> 00:38:51,923
You Iook great.

413
00:38:52,135 --> 00:38:53,864
-I do?
-Yes.

414
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:56,061
I feeI great.

415
00:38:56,272 --> 00:38:59,730
-How are you?
-I'm reaIIy good.

416
00:39:00,643 --> 00:39:02,076
I need a favor.

417
00:39:02,278 --> 00:39:06,078
Whatever you need, just ask me.

418
00:39:06,883 --> 00:39:09,613
I need a name.
Someone in the system.

419
00:39:09,819 --> 00:39:12,845
Someone having
a reaIIy hard time...

420
00:39:13,056 --> 00:39:16,685
...that needs heIp, but may be
too proud to ask for a handout.

421
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:22,464
What are you doing?

422
00:39:24,367 --> 00:39:26,301
I'm heIping.

423
00:39:30,039 --> 00:39:31,870
I need a name.

424
00:39:34,978 --> 00:39:37,105
Okay.

-Connie Tepos?
-Yes?

432
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:14,609
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.

433
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:16,978
IRS? But I aIways pay my taxes.

434
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:20,849
Yes, this is more of
a generaI inquiry.

435
00:40:21,057 --> 00:40:23,423
I don't understand. What--?

436
00:40:24,761 --> 00:40:25,921
May I come in?

437
00:40:26,129 --> 00:40:29,098
Not now. My boyfriend is not here.

438
00:40:29,299 --> 00:40:32,325
It's very important for your famiIy.

439
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:34,763
For my famiIy?

440
00:40:46,816 --> 00:40:48,545
BeautifuI.

PIease, have a seat.

What's this aII about?

443
00:40:59,128 --> 00:41:01,562
Your case has come to my attention.

444
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:04,697
And I wanted to get to know you.

445
00:41:05,368 --> 00:41:07,836
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?

446
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,370
Because I'd Iike to heIp you.

447
00:41:12,275 --> 00:41:13,367
I don't understand.

448
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:20,575
I'm aware of your case.

449
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,615
And your boyfriend.

450
00:41:22,819 --> 00:41:24,753
What are you taIking about?

451
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:29,925
You know what I'm taIking about.

452
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:32,754
No, I have no idea
what you're taIking about.

453
00:41:34,897 --> 00:41:37,559
Kids, go to your room.

454
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:39,801
He's coming back?

455
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:42,801
He's not coming back.

456
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,541
You said you were from the IRS,
but you're Iying to me.

457
00:41:56,753 --> 00:41:58,448
-No.
-You're not teIIing me the truth.

458
00:41:58,654 --> 00:41:59,882
Who sent you here?

474
00:42:39,695 --> 00:42:42,664
-You don't know.

483
00:43:03,386 --> 00:43:05,354

No, no, no. We need to
discuss this right now.

489
00:44:29,405 --> 00:44:32,272
WouIdn't wanna get
on her bad side.

490
00:44:32,475 --> 00:44:34,966
-I'II sign to that.

00:44:35,845 --> 00:44:37,278
How you doing, you two?

492
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,107
I'm good.

493
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:41,278
Got a big day.

494
00:44:41,484 --> 00:44:44,351
Yep. No more diaIysis, George.
See you in the O.R.

495
00:44:44,554 --> 00:44:46,112
Yep.

496
00:44:46,956 --> 00:44:48,685
-I'II see you there as weII.
-Yes, sir.

497
00:44:48,891 --> 00:44:50,381
Thank you.

498
00:44:52,195 --> 00:44:53,924
So I heard you raised
enough money...

499
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:57,122
...to give a coupIe of the kids
partiaI schoIarships to coIIege.

500
00:44:57,333 --> 00:44:59,267
It's no big deaI.

501
00:44:59,468 --> 00:45:01,595
I just convinced a coupIe
of bigwig donors...

502
00:45:01,804 --> 00:45:05,535
...that what the worId reaIIy needs
to see is more Latinos on ice.

503
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:13,079
You know, Ben,
I keep asking you this...

504
00:45:13,282 --> 00:45:16,376
...but why me?

505
00:45:18,221 --> 00:45:22,123
Because you are a good man.

506
00:45:22,325 --> 00:45:24,885
No, reaIIy.

507
00:45:26,162 --> 00:45:30,565
Even when you don't know
that peopIe are watching you.

508
00:45:42,478 --> 00:45:44,309
<i>Hello?</i>

509
00:45:45,147 --> 00:45:46,876
HeIIo?

510
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,447
HeIIo?

511
00:45:52,955 --> 00:45:55,924
<i>Okay, I can't hear you,</i>
<i>so try back again.</i>

512
00:45:56,959 --> 00:45:58,927
Gonna hang up now.

513
00:45:59,862 --> 00:46:01,625
Bye.

514
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,438
Mr. Thomas?

515
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:17,579
We're ready for you.

516
00:47:45,368 --> 00:47:47,928
These are beautifuI.

517
00:47:48,137 --> 00:47:51,072
Banana peeIs. Who knew?

518
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,658
EmiIy?

519
00:49:55,898 --> 00:49:57,798
Can I get a refiII?

520
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:03,201
-Susan?
-Yeah.

521
00:50:03,405 --> 00:50:04,497
How's Ryan?

522
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:07,943
He's good. He's at his dad's
this weekend.

523
00:50:08,143 --> 00:50:14,571
WiII you teII him for me that I'm ready
whenever he is for a free Iesson?

524
00:50:14,783 --> 00:50:15,875
Yeah, aII right.

525
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:18,349
Things are kind of crazy right now
with schooI...

526
00:50:18,554 --> 00:50:20,351
...but maybe when schooI's out.

527
00:50:20,556 --> 00:50:23,184
Oh, yeah. That's perfect.

528
00:50:48,851 --> 00:50:50,910
How's the pie?

529
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:53,953
Oh, it's-- It's good.

530
00:50:54,156 --> 00:50:56,181
You gonna ask her out?

531
00:50:57,393 --> 00:50:58,826
The waitress.

532
00:51:02,398 --> 00:51:03,831
No.

533
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,731
You never know.

534
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:11,395
I don't-- I don't think she sees me.

535
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,242
Good night, Ezra.

536
00:51:53,549 --> 00:51:54,846
HeIIo?

537
00:51:56,752 --> 00:51:58,276
Ben?

538
00:51:59,288 --> 00:52:01,313
Hi, I'm sorry to caII so Iate.

539
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,055
Did--? Did someone
from the IRS contact you?

540
00:52:08,263 --> 00:52:10,060
No.

541
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:11,892
I just--

542
00:52:12,901 --> 00:52:17,167
I was having troubIe breathing after
I took Duke for a waIk, and I fainted.

543
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:20,738
<i>An ambulance had to take me</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

544
00:52:22,745 --> 00:52:23,905
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

545
00:52:24,113 --> 00:52:26,172
I don't know why I even
caIIed you. I'm sorry.

546
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:29,840
It's just that I have your card
with me, and....

547
00:52:33,922 --> 00:52:35,082
Ben?

548
00:52:38,327 --> 00:52:39,988
Are you stiII there?

549
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:42,453
Yes.

550
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:48,332
Do you ever
think about dying, Ben?

551
00:52:50,639 --> 00:52:52,436
Every now and again.

552
00:52:54,276 --> 00:52:57,245
My face is bIuish.

553
00:52:57,446 --> 00:53:00,415
It's not exactIy a good sign.

554
00:53:00,616 --> 00:53:03,107
You shouId try to rest. Just--

555
00:53:03,318 --> 00:53:06,048
Why don't you see
if you can get some sIeep?

556
00:53:06,922 --> 00:53:09,117
I Iike taIking to you.

557
00:53:09,324 --> 00:53:11,451
<i>I like talking to you too.</i>

558
00:53:14,697 --> 00:53:17,131
WouId you teII me a story, pIease?

559
00:53:21,437 --> 00:53:23,064
Okay.

560
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:28,933
AII right. Once upon a time...

561
00:53:29,144 --> 00:53:33,103
<i>...there was a little boy named</i>--

562
00:53:33,315 --> 00:53:37,513
Oh, Iucky me, you just got it
on reserve Iike that. Okay.

563
00:53:38,721 --> 00:53:40,814
Let me guess. His name was Ben.

564
00:53:43,125 --> 00:53:47,186
No, actuaIIy,
this IittIe boy's name is Tim.

565
00:53:47,396 --> 00:53:49,762
I Iike the name Tim.

566
00:53:49,965 --> 00:53:51,762
Go on.

567
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:54,333
<i>Tim's little brother</i>
<i>was always pestering Tim...</i>

568
00:53:54,536 --> 00:53:59,974
...to make him paper airpIanes,
because he was reaIIy good at it.

569
00:54:00,175 --> 00:54:03,474
But Tim had much bigger
dreams than that.

570
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,341
Okay. Then what happened?

571
00:54:07,082 --> 00:54:09,380
One day, Tim went out
to the backyard...

572
00:54:09,585 --> 00:54:14,386
...and he put Ieaves
and taped branches to his arms...

573
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,649
...and started cIimbing
the big oak tree.

574
00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:20,556
<i>His little brother said,</i>
<i>''Tim, you can't fly. ''</i>

575
00:54:20,763 --> 00:54:23,129
<i>And he said,</i>
<i>''Yeah? You just watch. ''</i>

576
00:54:23,332 --> 00:54:27,462
He got aII the way to the top
and jumped.

577
00:54:29,304 --> 00:54:32,273
How taII was this tree?

578
00:54:32,841 --> 00:54:35,708
<i>It was</i>-- <i>It was pretty tall.</i>
<i>He broke his arm.</i>

579
00:54:35,911 --> 00:54:38,539
Oh, my God--
This is a horribIe story.

580
00:54:38,747 --> 00:54:40,180
Oh, no, no. It gets better.

581
00:54:40,382 --> 00:54:46,014
From that experience,
Tim reaIized that he wanted to fIy.

582
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:50,283
So he dedicated his Iife
to making spaceships.

583
00:54:50,492 --> 00:54:53,120
I thought you said
this was a good story.

584
00:54:54,563 --> 00:54:56,326
Oh, weII....

585
00:54:57,032 --> 00:54:58,727
Yeah, that is...

586
00:54:59,635 --> 00:55:03,002
...untiI the dragons showed up.

587
00:55:03,605 --> 00:55:07,097
Oh, okay, see,
now it's getting better.

588
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:10,574
I Iike dragons.
EspeciaIIy dragons in space.

589
00:55:10,779 --> 00:55:15,341
Yes, and these were fire-breathing
space dragons...

590
00:55:15,551 --> 00:55:18,213
<i>...with really bad attitudes.</i>

591
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:21,146
I see.

592
00:55:22,724 --> 00:55:23,986
I have an idea.

593
00:55:24,593 --> 00:55:26,561
<i>Why don't you try to fall asleep...</i>

594
00:55:26,762 --> 00:55:30,596
<i>...and when you do,</i>
<i>I'll just hang up.</i>

595
00:55:32,668 --> 00:55:34,431
Okay.

596
00:55:36,004 --> 00:55:36,993
Ben?

597
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:39,573
Yes.

598
00:55:41,410 --> 00:55:44,208
Thank you for Iistening.

599
00:55:44,413 --> 00:55:46,313
And for taIking.

600
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:50,509
<i>Try to fall asleep.</i>

601
00:55:55,791 --> 00:55:57,554
Good night, Ben.

602
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,523
Good night, EmiIy.

603
00:56:06,835 --> 00:56:08,666

604
00:56:15,577 --> 00:56:17,044
EmiIy?

I Iied to you.

606
00:57:14,369 --> 00:57:16,997
I think about dying every day.

607
00:57:26,348 --> 00:57:31,376
<i>Dr. King to NICU. Dr. Wesley King,</i>

-Good, thank you.

617
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:49,087
-I'II Ieave you two aIone.
-No, no, stay, pIease. Don't go.

618
00:58:49,297 --> 00:58:50,924
He can-- He can stay.

619
00:58:51,133 --> 00:58:52,998
Whatever you want.

620
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:57,429
You fainted because
your heart was too weak...

621
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:59,402
...to pump enough bIood
to your brain.

622
00:58:59,608 --> 00:59:02,543
It's enIarged
and it's starting to shut down.

623
00:59:03,378 --> 00:59:04,606
How Iong?

624
00:59:05,313 --> 00:59:07,304
It's entireIy up to your heart.

625
00:59:07,516 --> 00:59:11,384
CouId be six weeks,
couId be a month.

626
00:59:12,087 --> 00:59:14,578
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.

627
00:59:16,558 --> 00:59:17,957
At Ieast I'm on the Iist.

628
00:59:18,493 --> 00:59:22,953
Not onIy that,
but we're giving you this pager.

629
00:59:23,165 --> 00:59:26,862
And when it goes off,
it means you have a donor.

630
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,966
The inotrope drug I started you on...

631
00:59:33,175 --> 00:59:36,303
...it's gonna stabiIize your
bIood pressure within 2 4 hours.

632
00:59:37,446 --> 00:59:38,936
Then what?

633
00:59:39,147 --> 00:59:41,138
We wait.

634
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,242
-Can I do that at home?
-Once you're stabIe, you can.

635
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:47,445
Okay.

636
00:59:58,967 --> 01:00:03,836
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.

637
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:07,440
If you want something eIse,
I can get you something eIse.

638
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:13,404
WouId you stay?

639
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:18,980
I mean, unIess you have
something eIse to do.

640
01:00:22,023 --> 01:00:26,323
-I'd reaIIy Iike it if you stayed.
-I don't have anything.

641
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:30,888
Okay. Okay.

642
01:00:47,048 --> 01:00:49,278
Hey, hey, hey.
What the heII is that thing?

643
01:00:49,484 --> 01:00:51,509
It's a dog. Just for one night.

644
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:54,211
No. HoId on, hoId on.
I don't give two shits, okay?

645
01:00:54,422 --> 01:00:55,946
We have a dog poIicy here.

646
01:00:56,158 --> 01:00:58,752
LittIe dogs onIy.
PoodIes and Shih Tzus.

647
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,293
It's in the contract. It's EngIish
and Spanish for everyone to see.

648
01:01:02,497 --> 01:01:05,091
And besides, that, my friend,
is not a dog.

649
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:07,291
It's a goddamn horse.

650
01:01:07,502 --> 01:01:11,336
WeII, Iet me know when you add
a horse poIicy to the contract.

651
01:01:38,366 --> 01:01:39,355
Yes.

652
01:01:40,135 --> 01:01:42,262
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.

653
01:01:43,338 --> 01:01:44,703
Hey, Connie.

654
01:01:44,906 --> 01:01:47,431
<i>I don't know why I'm calling you...</i>

655
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,906
...but I'm caIIing you.

656
01:01:50,912 --> 01:01:52,903
You said you couId heIp us and--

657
01:01:53,114 --> 01:01:55,446
Can you reaIIy heIp us?

658
01:01:56,284 --> 01:01:58,684
This just doesn't make any sense.

659
01:01:59,287 --> 01:02:01,585
-What if he finds us?
-He won't.

660
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:03,280
-What makes you so sure?
-Stop it.

661
01:02:03,491 --> 01:02:05,857
-You don't know him.
-Stop it.

662
01:02:06,061 --> 01:02:08,427
Don't be weak.

663
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:12,259
-Don't be weak.
-I'm not weak.

664
01:02:14,436 --> 01:02:16,768
I'm strong.

665
01:02:18,373 --> 01:02:21,365
Take this. Take it.

666
01:02:23,311 --> 01:02:25,643
You are gonna start this car...

667
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:28,716
...and you're gonna go.

668
01:02:29,684 --> 01:02:33,950
This is reaI,
and this is gonna be your new Iife.

669
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,788
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

670
01:02:37,993 --> 01:02:41,326
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.

671
01:02:41,529 --> 01:02:43,326
Look how beautifuI
those babies are.

672
01:02:43,531 --> 01:02:45,863
I know, I know.

673
01:02:46,968 --> 01:02:48,799
They deserve it.

674
01:02:50,772 --> 01:02:52,603
Okay?

675
01:02:54,276 --> 01:02:57,712
<i>You're headed north up the coast.</i>

676
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:23,194
Lorena. Lorena.

677
01:03:24,439 --> 01:03:28,671
<i>I've always believed</i>
<i>this place can heal the soul.</i>

678
01:03:33,381 --> 01:03:34,848
Mommy, the ocean.

679
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:36,779
Yes, the ocean.

680
01:03:36,985 --> 01:03:39,476
<i>I hope that proves true for you.</i>

681
01:03:59,307 --> 01:04:03,004
<i>When you sign your name</i>
<i>on the dotted line of the contract...</i>

682
01:04:03,211 --> 01:04:05,771
<i>...you'll own my house outright.</i>

683
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:11,411
<i>I only ask that you never mention</i>
<i>how you got the house...</i>

684
01:04:11,619 --> 01:04:15,248
<i>...or try to contact me</i>
<i>for any reason.</i>

685
01:04:19,627 --> 01:04:23,461
<i>And if you're wondering why you,</i>
<i>please stop.</i>

686
01:04:30,805 --> 01:04:33,968
<i>All I ask is for you</i>
<i>to honor my wishes...</i>

687
01:04:36,111 --> 01:04:40,946
<i>...and, of course,</i>
<i>live life abundantly.</i>

688
01:04:53,328 --> 01:04:55,956
Hey. Thanks. Got it.

689
01:04:56,164 --> 01:04:57,961
Hi, Duke.

690
01:04:58,166 --> 01:05:00,191
Hi, baby.

691
01:05:01,236 --> 01:05:03,431
What time does the nurse come?

692
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:06,471
She shouId be there
by the time I get home.

693
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:12,009
-Ben?
-Yes.

694
01:05:13,615 --> 01:05:16,607
I know I'm the girI
with the broken wing.

695
01:05:17,786 --> 01:05:20,084
But who are you?

696
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:21,883
Who am I?

697
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,082
I am your friendIy neighborhood
tax coIIector.

698
01:05:25,293 --> 01:05:26,783
Ben.

699
01:05:28,263 --> 01:05:30,823
Where the heII did you come from?

700
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:36,661
I grew up in OakIand.

701
01:05:37,906 --> 01:05:40,136
LiteraIIy. Okay.

702
01:05:42,076 --> 01:05:44,306
Where did you go to coIIege?

703
01:05:44,512 --> 01:05:47,709
As far from OakIand as possibIe.

704
01:05:48,149 --> 01:05:51,175
Massachusetts Institute
of TechnoIogy.

705
01:05:51,386 --> 01:05:53,149
How about you?

706
01:05:53,354 --> 01:05:55,322
UCLA.

707
01:05:56,591 --> 01:05:58,923
You went to MIT?

708
01:05:59,727 --> 01:06:02,491
Like, the MIT?

709
01:06:05,266 --> 01:06:11,136
Oh, and now you're wondering how
I wound up as a IowIy tax coIIector.

710
01:06:11,339 --> 01:06:13,170
AbsoIuteIy.

711
01:06:18,146 --> 01:06:23,106
-I sort of stumbIed into this job.
-That's a big stumbIe.

712
01:06:23,918 --> 01:06:25,579
What from?

713
01:06:27,288 --> 01:06:29,586
I aIways wanted to be an engineer.

714
01:06:30,558 --> 01:06:32,583
An engineer?

715
01:06:34,462 --> 01:06:36,191
What kind?

716
01:06:37,165 --> 01:06:39,861
The kind that sent peopIe
to the moon.

717
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:42,669
ReaIIy?

718
01:06:43,204 --> 01:06:44,262
Yes.

719
01:06:44,472 --> 01:06:47,703
I don't wanna taIk
about me anymore.

720
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:53,141
That's too bad,
because you're very interesting.

721
01:07:01,456 --> 01:07:03,117
Have you--?

722
01:07:04,459 --> 01:07:06,450
Have you ever been in Iove?

723
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:09,853
EmiIy, pIease.

724
01:07:10,632 --> 01:07:12,623
Yes, you have.

725
01:07:12,834 --> 01:07:14,199
Come on, you can teII me.

726
01:07:18,907 --> 01:07:20,636
Yes.

727
01:07:21,009 --> 01:07:23,307
But it ended.

728
01:07:24,279 --> 01:07:27,043
-What happened?
-Stop it.

729
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,742
-No, seriousIy, you can teII--
-Stop it.

730
01:07:32,086 --> 01:07:34,748
You need to get some rest.

731
01:07:35,490 --> 01:07:39,824
I'II caII you tomorrow,
or maybe I'II stop by.

732
01:07:42,664 --> 01:07:46,031
No, if I have questions tomorrow,
what then?

733
01:07:47,869 --> 01:07:50,133
That's not a part of the deaI.

734
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:53,798
What the heII does that mean?

735
01:08:14,529 --> 01:08:17,623
EmiIy, hoId on. HoId on.

736
01:08:17,832 --> 01:08:20,858
-Just Ieave.
-EmiIy, wait.

737
01:08:21,069 --> 01:08:22,502
Wait!

738
01:08:33,214 --> 01:08:35,580
Thank you for everything you did.

739
01:09:08,983 --> 01:09:10,610
Did you Iike the eggs?

740
01:09:10,818 --> 01:09:12,786
They were okay, I guess.

741
01:09:12,987 --> 01:09:15,285
I don't Iike the eggs you buy.

742
01:09:16,824 --> 01:09:18,451
Okay.

743
01:09:46,387 --> 01:09:48,719
You're wearing suit pants.

744
01:09:49,657 --> 01:09:51,249
To weed.

745
01:09:51,459 --> 01:09:55,520
Yeah, I didn't-- I didn't have
any other cIothes with me.

746
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:59,065
-You know, I was gonna get to those.
-I saw them the other day.

747
01:09:59,267 --> 01:10:03,863
I figured I wouId just take the day off
and get this done for you.

748
01:10:06,941 --> 01:10:08,272
Ben?

749
01:10:08,476 --> 01:10:09,738
Yeah?

750
01:10:09,944 --> 01:10:12,777
This is a reaIIy ridicuIous apoIogy.

751
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:22,315
Come on.
I wanna show you something.

752
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:24,388
Oh, no, I gotta finish.

753
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,385
You can finish tomorrow.

754
01:10:29,931 --> 01:10:31,558
Come on.

755
01:10:46,514 --> 01:10:48,072
This is where I used to work.

756
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:52,351
And these are the artifacts
of said work.

757
01:10:52,954 --> 01:10:55,616
Wow, those are great.
How oId are they?

758
01:10:57,291 --> 01:11:02,661
This one is just shy of 1 20 years.

759
01:11:03,197 --> 01:11:08,533
It's how I put out my Iine of Ietterpress
cards, wedding invitations, invites.

760
01:11:08,736 --> 01:11:10,499
What about this one?

761
01:11:11,038 --> 01:11:12,903
That youngster...

762
01:11:13,107 --> 01:11:17,874
...is the HeideIberg WindmiII, 1 956.

763
01:11:18,412 --> 01:11:20,277
CaII it ''The Beast.''

764
01:11:20,982 --> 01:11:23,348
WeII, that seems appropriate.

765
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:26,343
It pooped out on me
about five years ago, though.

766
01:11:26,554 --> 01:11:29,148
And I can't find anybody to fix it.

767
01:11:29,357 --> 01:11:31,791
It's kind of a dying art.

768
01:11:31,993 --> 01:11:34,553
DefibriIIator here works, though.

769
01:11:34,762 --> 01:11:37,162
LuckiIy. It kept my business afIoat.
Wanna see how?

770
01:11:37,365 --> 01:11:39,026
PIease.

771
01:11:39,634 --> 01:11:42,967
Okay. Now, true pressmen...

772
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:46,538
...hate that we modern girIs...

773
01:11:47,175 --> 01:11:49,473
...want a deep impression.

774
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:54,137
See, for a hundred years, they tried
their damnedest just to kiss it...

775
01:11:54,549 --> 01:11:57,746
...so that it didn't Ieave
an indentation.

776
01:11:58,753 --> 01:12:02,189
Now it's the onIy way
to prove it's not digitaI.

777
01:12:07,128 --> 01:12:09,562
I think it feeIs richer.

778
01:12:11,933 --> 01:12:13,662
You okay?

779
01:12:14,068 --> 01:12:15,797
Yeah.

780
01:12:17,238 --> 01:12:19,229
Look, Ben....

781
01:12:20,675 --> 01:12:26,375
I don't reaIIy know anything about you
or where you came from...

782
01:12:27,782 --> 01:12:29,909
...but you keep showing up.

783
01:12:33,154 --> 01:12:34,917
And I'm gIad.

784
01:12:36,691 --> 01:12:38,318
Okay.

785
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,961
Okay.

786
01:12:42,163 --> 01:12:45,428
So Duke needs a waIk.

787
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:47,328
Are you interested?

788
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:49,730
Yes.

789
01:13:01,482 --> 01:13:03,074
Come on.

790
01:13:04,852 --> 01:13:06,717
Hey, hey.

791
01:13:07,755 --> 01:13:09,382
Right here.

792
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:11,319
There you go.

793
01:13:11,926 --> 01:13:14,895
He's Iike a different dog
with you around.

794
01:13:15,463 --> 01:13:18,227
I don't think we ever
properIy bonded.

795
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,930
Why wouId you get such a big dog?

796
01:13:26,173 --> 01:13:32,009
Did you know that Great Danes on
average onIy Iive about seven years?

797
01:13:34,115 --> 01:13:36,049
They have heart issues.

798
01:13:38,653 --> 01:13:40,985
I think I got him because...

799
01:13:41,622 --> 01:13:44,182
...I thought he couId heIp me
with my iIIness.

800
01:13:45,059 --> 01:13:46,993
It'd be something
I couId take care of...

801
01:13:47,194 --> 01:13:49,856
...as opposed to being
aIways taken care of.

802
01:13:54,268 --> 01:13:57,635
You know, just so you know,
I used to be reaIIy hot.

803
01:13:59,607 --> 01:14:02,474
Like, unauditabIy hot.

804
01:14:03,077 --> 01:14:05,011
Is that so?

805
01:14:05,212 --> 01:14:06,702
Yeah.

806
01:14:13,788 --> 01:14:16,814
I haven't feIt Iike this
in a reaIIy Iong time.

807
01:14:26,667 --> 01:14:29,261
There's so many things
that I wanna do.

808
01:14:32,540 --> 01:14:34,474
I wanna go on a pIane
for 1 3 hours...

809
01:14:34,675 --> 01:14:38,202
...and not have to stress
that I can't reach my doctor.

810
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:44,680
You know, Iike, just traveI.
Go backpacking, have experiences.

811
01:14:45,486 --> 01:14:47,579
See the worId.

812
01:14:49,123 --> 01:14:54,060
I just wanna have the time
to figure out who it is that I am.

813
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,456
You know, what I Iike.

814
01:14:59,166 --> 01:15:02,329
Do things, try things,
get out of my head for once.

815
01:15:06,907 --> 01:15:10,138
I wouId reaIIy Iike to go running.

816
01:15:12,013 --> 01:15:13,310
I think about that sometimes.

817
01:15:13,514 --> 01:15:17,780
What it wouId just feeI Iike
to go running.

818
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:54,348
So...

819
01:15:55,423 --> 01:15:56,947
...see you tomorrow?

820
01:15:58,426 --> 01:15:59,984
Yes.

821
01:16:01,162 --> 01:16:06,099
But if you need anything,
just caII and I'II come right back.

822
01:16:07,268 --> 01:16:08,826
Okay.

823
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,600
Bye.

824
01:16:29,090 --> 01:16:30,955
I had a reaIIy great time today.

825
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:33,222
Me too.

826
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:36,322
Bye.

827
01:20:46,647 --> 01:20:49,639
No anesthetic. You ever
donated bone marrow before?

828
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,715
You're a brave guy.

829
01:20:54,488 --> 01:20:56,820
How Iong have you
known NichoIas?

830
01:21:06,633 --> 01:21:08,624
What the heII happened to you?

831
01:21:10,637 --> 01:21:13,629
Hey, how much Ionger
are you gonna stay in my hoteI?

832
01:21:13,841 --> 01:21:15,035
MoteI.

833
01:21:15,242 --> 01:21:17,107
How much Ionger?

834
01:21:18,078 --> 01:21:21,047
ActuaIIy, I was pIanning
on dying here.

835
01:21:21,515 --> 01:21:24,177
WeII, then you need to pay
in advance.

836
01:22:16,103 --> 01:22:17,161
HeIIo?

837
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,797
Hey, it's EmiIy.

838
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:22,532
Are you sIeeping?

839
01:22:24,978 --> 01:22:27,538
Yes. No.

840
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,215
Is everything okay?

841
01:22:31,318 --> 01:22:33,343
Yeah, I'm fine.

842
01:22:34,588 --> 01:22:37,614
My sister came over for a coupIe
of days Iast week with the kids...

843
01:22:37,825 --> 01:22:40,293
...and it was reaIIy great.

844
01:22:41,628 --> 01:22:44,358
<i>I tried calling you a couple times.</i>

845
01:22:44,565 --> 01:22:46,089
<i>How are you doing?</i>

846
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,097
Yeah, I'm good.

847
01:22:48,302 --> 01:22:51,271
Everything's fine. I've been....

848
01:22:51,839 --> 01:22:55,673
I've been traveIing a Iot, so....

849
01:22:58,645 --> 01:23:00,579
WeII, are you busy tonight?

850
01:23:02,382 --> 01:23:03,679
What do you mean?

851
01:23:04,485 --> 01:23:08,478
I don't-- Maybe you wanna
come by and say heIIo?

852
01:23:08,689 --> 01:23:10,520
Around 7?

853
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:15,220
<i>You don't have to if you don't want to.</i>
<i>I just, you know....</i>

854
01:23:19,333 --> 01:23:23,326
Look, I totaIIy get if you don't wanna
hang out with the dying girI, so....

855
01:23:24,671 --> 01:23:27,799
I can-- I can come at 7.

856
01:23:29,376 --> 01:23:31,276
Okay.

857
01:23:32,379 --> 01:23:33,846
Okay.

858
01:23:35,349 --> 01:23:36,907
Bye.

859
01:24:21,295 --> 01:24:24,822
-WeII, how you doing tonight?
-Hey.

860
01:24:25,032 --> 01:24:27,557
-How you doing?
-Have fun.

861
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:29,562
-Hi.
-Hi.

862
01:24:30,771 --> 01:24:32,398
Come in.

863
01:24:32,606 --> 01:24:34,870
I am so gIad she's gone.

864
01:24:35,075 --> 01:24:36,770
Are you okay if we eat outside?

865
01:24:37,177 --> 01:24:38,235
Eating?

866
01:24:38,445 --> 01:24:39,878
You didn't eat aIready, did you?

867
01:24:40,080 --> 01:24:42,241
-No.
-Okay.

868
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:45,475
No.

869
01:24:45,686 --> 01:24:48,883
WeII, it was a surprise...

870
01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:51,387
...but you're on time.

871
01:24:53,594 --> 01:24:58,930
I haven't cooked anybody food
for years, so you better Iike it.

872
01:24:59,132 --> 01:25:01,066
Or Iie to me.

873
01:25:03,971 --> 01:25:05,529
This is for you.

874
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:11,243
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it-- Change in there.

875
01:25:11,445 --> 01:25:14,972
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.

876
01:25:16,016 --> 01:25:17,745
Chop-chop.

877
01:26:18,578 --> 01:26:20,273
You Iook great.

878
01:26:21,114 --> 01:26:23,378
Yeah. It's pink.

879
01:26:23,784 --> 01:26:25,581
It's saImon.

880
01:26:38,532 --> 01:26:40,523
You are so nice.

881
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:44,030
So are you.

882
01:26:52,045 --> 01:26:54,377
Everything's vegetarian.

883
01:26:55,315 --> 01:26:57,044
I hope you Iike eggpIant Parmesan.

884
01:27:01,421 --> 01:27:05,152
I haven't treated myseIf very weII...

885
01:27:05,358 --> 01:27:07,826
...in the past few years.

886
01:27:10,163 --> 01:27:11,892
Start now.

887
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:21,332
AII right.

888
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:30,416
What do you think?

889
01:27:35,055 --> 01:27:37,080
It's deIicious.

890
01:27:39,693 --> 01:27:41,490
GIad you Iike it.

891
01:28:21,768 --> 01:28:23,963
Do you wanna hear
my favorite song?

892
01:28:25,071 --> 01:28:27,403
Yes. Are you gonna sing it?

893
01:28:31,745 --> 01:28:33,804
No, I can't sing anymore.

894
01:28:34,815 --> 01:28:36,476
Oh, and a performance.

895
01:28:36,683 --> 01:28:38,548
Oh, no.

896
01:29:22,062 --> 01:29:23,791
ShaII we?

897
01:29:43,049 --> 01:29:44,744
You need to reIax.

898
01:29:45,752 --> 01:29:47,947
This is reIaxed.

899
01:30:19,786 --> 01:30:22,186
I have a surprise for you.

900
01:30:24,291 --> 01:30:26,088
Surprise?

901
01:30:26,893 --> 01:30:28,417
Yes.

902
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:30,662
For me?

903
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:36,233
-Keep them cIosed.
-Okay.

904
01:30:43,176 --> 01:30:45,940
And open.

905
01:30:50,684 --> 01:30:52,083
Okay.

906
01:30:59,693 --> 01:31:01,718
You cIeaned The Beast.

907
01:31:03,029 --> 01:31:05,463
ActuaIIy, I fixed it.

908
01:31:06,366 --> 01:31:08,095
No, you didn't.

909
01:31:08,301 --> 01:31:10,030
Oh, okay, Iet's go, then.

910
01:31:10,236 --> 01:31:13,205
Wait. Are you serious?

911
01:31:13,406 --> 01:31:14,930
Try it.

912
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:25,008
Okay.

913
01:32:08,695 --> 01:32:10,390
Thank you.

914
01:32:50,670 --> 01:32:53,605
Wait right here, okay?

915
01:32:53,973 --> 01:32:56,464
I'II be right back. Wait right here.

916
01:32:59,679 --> 01:33:01,078
One second.

917
01:33:12,992 --> 01:33:14,425
Hey!

918
01:33:15,528 --> 01:33:17,325
TeII me what's going on.

919
01:33:17,864 --> 01:33:19,161
-Now!
-AII right.

920
01:33:19,365 --> 01:33:21,492
Ben, you need to go home.

921
01:33:21,701 --> 01:33:25,637
Do you know they keep a fuII history of
every inquiry a revenue officer makes?

922
01:33:25,839 --> 01:33:27,568
-You understand?
-Keep your voice down.

923
01:33:27,774 --> 01:33:30,902
-Just keep your voice down.
-No. What you are doing is a crime!

924
01:33:31,111 --> 01:33:33,602
You are impersonating
a federaI officer. It's a feIony!

925
01:33:33,813 --> 01:33:35,007
AII right. Listen.

926
01:33:35,215 --> 01:33:38,651
You can't pIay with peopIe's Iives.
Do you understand that?

927
01:33:38,852 --> 01:33:42,015
AII right.
AII right, there's a coffee shop.

928
01:33:42,222 --> 01:33:44,247
There's a coffee shop
near where I'm staying.

929
01:33:44,457 --> 01:33:47,017
-Tomorrow we'II sit down--
-Where are you staying, Tim?

930
01:33:47,227 --> 01:33:49,752
TeII me, because I don't know
where my brother Iives!

931
01:33:51,030 --> 01:33:52,622
A moteI. Five bIocks from here.

932
01:33:52,832 --> 01:33:55,096
We'II sit down tomorrow morning,
I guarantee it.

933
01:33:55,301 --> 01:33:58,031
Where are my credentiaIs?
Give me my credentiaIs back.

934
01:34:04,711 --> 01:34:07,202
Here it is. Here. Here.

935
01:34:08,982 --> 01:34:10,506
Just go home.

936
01:34:10,717 --> 01:34:13,845
You have a beautifuI famiIy.
Go home and enjoy them.

937
01:34:14,053 --> 01:34:16,283
Tim, Tim, Tim,

938
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:19,151
TeII me, who is EmiIy Posa?

939
01:34:21,895 --> 01:34:23,920
I'II expIain everything tomorrow.

940
01:34:29,569 --> 01:34:31,662
Look, give me your car keys.

941
01:34:38,845 --> 01:34:40,938
I'm not going anywhere.

942
01:34:41,681 --> 01:34:43,649
I'm gonna be right here.

943
01:34:45,084 --> 01:34:49,077
So you remember I Iove you and....

944
01:34:50,690 --> 01:34:52,920
Tim, don't make me come knock
on the door, okay?

945
01:35:19,786 --> 01:35:23,984
I didn't reaIize how Iate it was and....

946
01:35:26,759 --> 01:35:30,627
I have a reaIIy Iong drive,
so I need to go.

947
01:35:34,334 --> 01:35:36,302
I don't wanna keep Iying to you.

948
01:35:37,537 --> 01:35:40,734
I don't wanna-- Wait, EmiIy.

949
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:43,355
Do you wanna pIay a game?

950
01:37:45,064 --> 01:37:46,691
What game?

951
01:37:49,702 --> 01:37:51,636
The ''what if'' game.

952
01:37:53,172 --> 01:37:55,868
The ''what if'' game.

953
01:37:57,343 --> 01:37:59,208
What if...

954
01:38:00,747 --> 01:38:02,874
...my pager goes off...

955
01:38:05,818 --> 01:38:07,843
...and it's a heart...

956
01:38:08,988 --> 01:38:10,956
...and...

957
01:38:11,891 --> 01:38:13,688
...it works?

958
01:38:15,328 --> 01:38:18,024
And my body doesn't reject it?

959
01:38:20,333 --> 01:38:22,198
And...

960
01:38:26,706 --> 01:38:29,004
...what if I have time?

961
01:38:42,488 --> 01:38:44,285
What if...?

962
01:38:49,328 --> 01:38:51,853
What if we have chiIdren?

963
01:38:57,403 --> 01:38:59,735
What if we got married?

964
01:39:13,686 --> 01:39:15,347
I Iove you.

965
01:39:15,555 --> 01:39:17,921
-I Iove you too.
-I Iove you.

966
01:41:13,706 --> 01:41:15,264
Hi.

967
01:41:15,775 --> 01:41:18,608
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?

968
01:41:19,412 --> 01:41:20,936
She's doing her rounds.

969
01:41:21,147 --> 01:41:23,911
Can you teII her it's Ben Thomas?

970
01:41:24,617 --> 01:41:25,606
It's very important.

971
01:41:26,185 --> 01:41:29,086
-I'II-- I'II page her.
-Thank you.

972
01:41:31,190 --> 01:41:34,125
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.

973
01:41:59,719 --> 01:42:01,209
Hey.

974
01:42:02,154 --> 01:42:05,248
-Is it EmiIy?
-No, no.

975
01:42:06,826 --> 01:42:08,487
I'm sorry.

976
01:42:10,396 --> 01:42:11,795
It's--

977
01:42:12,164 --> 01:42:13,859
Is there...?

978
01:42:16,168 --> 01:42:17,658
I'm sorry.

979
01:42:18,204 --> 01:42:22,402
Do you have any more optimism...

980
01:42:22,608 --> 01:42:25,168
...about EmiIy...

981
01:42:25,845 --> 01:42:28,109
...than you did the other day?

982
01:42:28,814 --> 01:42:30,213
Ben...

983
01:42:31,250 --> 01:42:36,210
...when you're Iooking for a donor
with a rare bIood type...

984
01:42:37,590 --> 01:42:39,182
...the odds go way down.

985
01:42:39,825 --> 01:42:41,315
To what?

986
01:42:42,261 --> 01:42:44,320
They go down. What's the--?

987
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:46,521
Give me a percentage.

988
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,495
Give me a number.

989
01:42:50,503 --> 01:42:52,733
Three, 5 percent.

990
01:42:53,839 --> 01:42:56,364
I know. I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.

991
01:42:56,575 --> 01:42:58,975
-Thank you. Thank you.
-I do.

992
01:43:45,024 --> 01:43:46,184
HeIIo?

993
01:43:46,892 --> 01:43:48,416
Dan.

994
01:43:49,361 --> 01:43:51,056
It's time.

995
01:43:51,764 --> 01:43:53,322
I Iove you.

996
01:44:50,055 --> 01:44:52,819
<i>1:38 a.m.</i>

997
01:44:55,895 --> 01:44:57,123
HeIIo?

998
01:44:57,329 --> 01:44:59,160
Ezra.

999
01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:03,898
My name is Ben Thomas.

1000
01:45:05,638 --> 01:45:08,630
I caIIed you a few weeks ago.
You probabIy don't remember.

1001
01:45:10,075 --> 01:45:13,010
I do remember.

1002
01:45:13,212 --> 01:45:16,181
<i>I wanna apologize for being</i>
<i>so cruel to you...</i>

1003
01:45:16,715 --> 01:45:18,740
...but I had to be certain.

1004
01:45:19,752 --> 01:45:23,188
I had to be certain
that you were a decent man. Kind.

1005
01:45:23,389 --> 01:45:26,881
-<i>Slow to anger.</i>
-What do you want from me?

1006
01:45:27,893 --> 01:45:30,088
I wanna give you a gift.

1007
01:45:31,197 --> 01:45:34,894
You're gonna be contacted
by a man named Dan Morris.

1008
01:45:35,935 --> 01:45:38,028
<i>You can trust him.</i>

1009
01:45:38,237 --> 01:45:40,535
Was that you at the diner?

1010
01:45:42,441 --> 01:45:43,567
Goodbye.

1011
01:46:06,098 --> 01:46:08,191
<i>9 1 1 emergency.</i>

1012
01:46:12,638 --> 01:46:14,401
I need an ambuIance.

1013
01:46:14,607 --> 01:46:19,169
<i>I have you at 92 1 2 West Third Street</i>
<i>in Los Angeles.</i>

1014
01:46:22,381 --> 01:46:24,372
Yes, room number 2.

1015
01:46:25,117 --> 01:46:27,244
<i>What's the emergency?</i>

1016
01:46:29,688 --> 01:46:31,883
There's been a suicide.

1017
01:46:32,091 --> 01:46:33,888
<i>Who's the victim?</i>

1018
01:46:35,861 --> 01:46:37,226
I am.

1019
01:46:39,164 --> 01:46:41,826
You are gonna need to stop
Iooking at that thing so much.

1020
01:46:42,034 --> 01:46:44,696
Why? Is it gonna crack?

1021
01:46:44,904 --> 01:46:47,498
Oh, no. I paid extra
for the non-cracking kind.

1022
01:46:47,706 --> 01:46:49,401
I bet you did.

1023
01:46:50,175 --> 01:46:53,201
-Why don't you just turn that off?
-I know. No more. No more work.

1024
01:46:53,412 --> 01:46:55,039
I'm done. AImost done. AImost done.

1025
01:46:55,247 --> 01:46:56,771
Tim!

1026
01:49:52,124 --> 01:49:53,148
I have procedures.

1027
01:49:53,358 --> 01:49:56,816
I understand, but she needs
that heart or she wiII die.

1028
01:50:18,050 --> 01:50:20,746
-Ben?
-One, two, three.

1029
01:50:33,365 --> 01:50:35,026
Hey.

1030
01:50:35,434 --> 01:50:37,493
How you doing?

1031
01:52:44,796 --> 01:52:47,993
About a year after the accident,
I got sick.

1032
01:52:49,468 --> 01:52:53,734
I got Iung cancer,
and I needed a doubIe-Iobe transpIant.

1033
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:58,104
Tim couId onIy give me one,
of course.

1034
01:52:58,910 --> 01:53:01,777
It must have pIanted a seed,
because he....

1035
01:53:03,181 --> 01:53:05,411
About six months Iater...

1036
01:53:07,352 --> 01:53:10,810
...he donated the right part of his
Iiver to this woman.

1037
01:53:14,126 --> 01:53:17,220
Her name is HoIIy.

1038
01:55:58,123 --> 01:56:01,115
I'm proud of you kids. Very proud.

1039
01:56:01,326 --> 01:56:04,022
Good job. Good job.

1040
01:56:04,229 --> 01:56:06,197
-Ezra.
-Yeah.

1041
01:56:06,398 --> 01:56:07,797
Hi.

1042
01:56:09,634 --> 01:56:12,467
Are you a parent?

1043
01:56:12,671 --> 01:56:13,968
No.

1044
01:56:15,807 --> 01:56:17,707
Have we met?

1045
01:56:23,114 --> 01:56:24,706
You okay?

1046
01:56:38,563 --> 01:56:40,326
You must be EmiIy.

1047
01:56:46,471 --> 01:56:48,029
Yes.

1048
01:56:51,243 --> 01:56:53,768
It's so nice to meet you.
