A COUPLE OF KIDS, 17.

164
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,236
I HEARD THE DRUM AND
FIFE YESTERDAY, MAC,

165
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,238
MARCHING PAST.

166
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,241
IT MADE MY HAIR
STAND ON END.

167
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,243
THERE WE GO.

168
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,246
THERE WE GO, MOLLY.

169
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,748
WE'VE BEEN ASLEEP
FOR 20 YEARS!

170
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,249
AW, GO TO HELL!

171
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,751
COME ON!

172
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:21,751
COME ON!

173
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,254
GOOD NIGHT, 
MOLLY.

174
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,256
GOOD NIGHT.

175
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,760
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT TIME IT IS?

176
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,261
GO TO BED
THIS MINUTE!

177
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:32,762
GO TO BED
THIS MINUTE!

178
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:37,767
DON'T WORRY,
SUE.

179
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,770
WE'RE NOT GOING 
TO BE LIKE THEM

180
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,271
WHENWEGROW UP.

181
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,774
WE'RE NOT EVEN
LIKE THEM NOW.

182
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:45,274
WE'RE NOT EVEN
LIKE THEM NOW.

183
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,781
[STATIC]

184
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,283
WE'RE STANDING
IN THE POURING RAIN

185
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:57,286
OUTSIDE OF A ROAD
SQUELCHING WITH MUD

186
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,790
AND LINED WITH THE INEVITABLE
DOUBLE ROW OF POPLARS.

187
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,793
A FEW LORRIES ONLY
ARE SPLASHING BY

188
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,295
TO AND FROM
THE FORWARD AREAS,

189
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,298
BUT COMING DOWN THE ROAD
TOWARDS US

190
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,303
IS A BATTALION THAT I KNOW TO
BE OF A FAMOUS IRISH REGIMENT.

191
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,305
THEY'RE MARCHING IN THREES,

192
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,308
AND, IN THEIR FULL
BATTLE DRESS AND KIT,

193
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:23,813
THEY BLEND WITH THE BLOOMING
GREEN GRASS OF THE ROADSIDE...

194
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,814
FORWARD!

195
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,817
I RODE INTO BATTLE
WITH DRAWN SWORD

196
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,318
AGAINST THE TURKS.

197
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,321
WE DID OUR BIT
IN THE LAST LOT.

198
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,824
I HEARD THE DRUM
AND FIFE YESTERDAY

199
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:36,325
MARCHING PAST.

200
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:39,328
IT MADE MY HAIR
STAND ON END.

201
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,830
WHAT DID WE KNOW?

202
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,332
A COUPLE OF KIDS, 17.

203
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:46,335
I FOUGHT AGAINST THE TURKS,
MACHETES AGAINST ARTILLERY.

204
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,837
UNTIL VICTORY IS WON...

205
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,839
DAD!

206
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,340
DAD!

207
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:51,340
DAD!

208
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,853
UNCLE MAC!

209
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:03,853
UNCLE MAC!

210
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,864
DAD.

211
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,366
[LAUGHTER]

212
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,868
DAD!

213
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:20,369
BOYS!

214
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,371
IT'S LOVELY
TO SEE YOU.

215
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,873
SMASHING
TO SEE YOU.

216
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:25,875
YOU TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

217
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,376
I'LL SEE YOU.

218
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:28,878
TAKE CARE.

219
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,379
TAKE CARE.

220
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:30,379
TAKE CARE.

221
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,883
HELLO, KIDS!

222
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:33,883
HELLO, KIDS!

223
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,386
OH, SORRY, KIDS!

224
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:37,386
OH, SORRY, KIDS!

225
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,891
I JOINED UP. WHOO!

226
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:41,891
I JOINED UP. WHOO!

227
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:47,897
I NEEDED SOME DUTCH COURAGE
TO TELL YOUR MOTHER.

228
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:50,399
NEVER SAY DIE!

229
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,901
STEADY, THE BUFFS!

230
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:53,402
ARM THE ARSENAL!

231
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:54,403
HA HA HA!

232
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:54,904
HA HA HA!

233
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,419
OH, HE'S
ONE OF THE BEST.

234
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:10,419
OH, HE'S
ONE OF THE BEST.

235
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,427
GET AWAY!

236
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:18,427
GET AWAY!

237
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,433
HA HA HA!

238
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:24,433
HA HA HA!

239
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,439
YOU SHUT HIS HAND
IN THE DOOR.

240
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:30,940
YOU SHUT HIS HAND
IN THE DOOR.

241
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,442
YOU SILLY BEGGAR!

242
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:34,944
AHH!

243
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,947
WE'RE TRYING
TO WIN A WAR,

244
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,951
AND YOU SHUT YOUR
FINGERS IN A CAR DOOR!

245
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,954
AHH! MY HAND!

246
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,956
SORRY.

247
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:46,956
SORRY.

248
00:11:53,462 --> 00:11:54,964
THAT'S IT,

249
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,465
FOR THE DURATION.

250
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:56,465
FOR THE DURATION.

251
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,470
POP IN AND GIVE HER
A POLISH, BILLY BOY,

252
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,972
JUST NOW AND THEN.

253
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,474
A CAR NEEDS
TO BE CHERISHED.

254
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:05,474
A CAR NEEDS
TO BE CHERISHED.

255
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,978
HAS SUE
GOT IT RIGHT?

256
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,479
WHAT'S THAT?

257
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:13,482
YOU JOINED UP.

258
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,984
OH, THAT!

259
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,987
I WISH YOU COULD HAVE
TOLD ME YOURSELF.

260
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:20,990
OH, GRACE. IT'S 
NOT FOR LONG.

261
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,993
THEY SAY IT'LL
BE OVER BY CHRISTMAS.

262
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:24,994
HEY!

263
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,495
NO. NO, LEAVE--

264
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,997
YES.

265
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,498
I DON'T WANT TO--

266
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,000
COME ON.

267
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,501
STOP IT!

268
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:32,501
STOP IT!

269
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,504
DON'T BE DAFT!

270
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,006
ACT YOUR AGE!

271
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,507
HA HA HA!

272
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:38,507
HA HA HA!

273
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:48,017
I CAN'T COPE
ON MY OWN.

274
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:48,017
I CAN'T COPE
ON MY OWN.

275
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,521
I'D BETTER LET
THE CHILDREN GO.

276
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:52,521
I'D BETTER LET
THE CHILDREN GO.

277
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,526
OH!

278
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,028
NICE CATCH, 
BILLY.

279
00:12:59,028 --> 00:12:59,028
NICE CATCH, 
BILLY.

280
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,534
OOH! OH!

281
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,036
HIYA!

282
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,537
OH!

283
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:08,537
OH!

284
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,044
BILLY,
BEFORE I GO,

285
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:18,047
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

286
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,549
YOU'RE NOT QUITE
OLD ENOUGH, BUT...

287
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,551
WELL...

288
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:22,551
WELL...

289
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:28,557
IT'S THE GOOGLIE.

290
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,560
YOUR HAND IS TOO
SMALL TO MASTER IT,

291
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,562
BUT YOU CAN
MAKE A START.

292
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,064
ANYWAY...

293
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:38,067
I'M GOING TO PASS
ON THE SECRET NOW,

294
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,069
FATHER TO SON,
IN CASE...

295
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:42,571
IN CASE ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME.

296
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:42,571
IN CASE ANYTHING
HAPPENS TO ME.

297
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,574
ALL RIGHT?

298
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:45,574
ALL RIGHT?

299
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,078
NOW...

300
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:52,081
YOU KNOW
THE LEG BREAK, RIGHT?

301
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:52,081
YOU KNOW
THE LEG BREAK, RIGHT?

302
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,085
AND THE OFF BREAK?

303
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:56,085
AND THE OFF BREAK?

304
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,589
NOW, THE GOOGLIE
LOOKS LIKE A LEG BREAK,

305
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,092
BUT IT'S REALLY
AN OFF BREAK.

306
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,593
GOT IT?
LIKE THIS.

307
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,095
THAT'S LIKE
TELLING FIBS.

308
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,097
WHEN YOU
TELL A LIE,

309
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,100
YOU WANT TO
GET AWAY WITH IT.

310
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,102
BUT WHEN
SOMEONE ELSE DOES,

311
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,604
YOU WANT TO
FIND THEM OUT.

312
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,607
A GOOD BATSMAN
WILL SPOT A GOOGLIE.

313
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,110
A GOOD BOWLER WILL
HIDE IT.

314
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,112
ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT, SON.

315
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:23,612
ALWAYS REMEMBER
THAT, SON.

316
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,116
GOOD-BYE, GRACE.

317
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,118
OH, GRACE.

318
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,619
TAP'S
RUNNING.

319
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:30,619
TAP'S
RUNNING.

320
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,127
MUST GO.

321
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:38,127
MUST GO.

322
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,633
BE GOOD.

323
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,135
BYE-BYE,
DADDY.

324
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,637
GOOD-BYE,
DAWN.

325
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,139
TAKE CARE
OF SUSIE.

326
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:50,139
TAKE CARE
OF SUSIE.

327
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,643
BYE, BILLY.

328
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:54,643
BYE, BILLY.

329
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,148
BILLY...

00:54:58,211 --> 00:54:59,713
MAYBE THEY
PLANTED IT.

1174
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,215
THEY KNOW WE
ARE MAD ON JAM.

1175
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:04,217
THEY COULD POISON
THE COUNTRY!

1176
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:04,718
THEY COULD POISON
THE COUNTRY!

1177
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,725
COME AWAY.

1178
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:14,227
I DON'T WANT YOU
STANDING TOO CLOSE.

1179
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:15,729
COME HERE, SUSIE.

1180
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:15,729
COME HERE, SUSIE.

1181
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,741
WELL?

1182
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:28,241
WELL?

1183
00:55:34,247 --> 00:55:35,248
IT LOOKS...
FOREIGN.

1184
00:55:35,749 --> 00:55:36,750
JAM IS JAM!

1185
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,251
IT'S JUST...

1186
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,753
JAM!

1187
00:55:40,253 --> 00:55:41,254
I'M NOT
HAVING ANY,

1188
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,256
EVEN IF IT'S
NOT POISONED.

1189
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:44,758
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

1190
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,259
IT'S NOT
PATRIOTIC.

1191
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,761
YOU DON'T
LIKE JAM.

1192
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:49,262
YOU NEVER
EAT JAM.

1193
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,764

1194
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:52,265
THAT'S NOT
THE POINT.

1195
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:53,767
TASTE IT!

1196
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,769
WHY DON'T
YOU TASTE IT?

1197
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,270
YOUTASTE IT.

1198
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:57,771
YOUTASTE IT.

1199

THAT'S IT!
COME ON.

1202
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,808
YOU MEAN
THEY LET YOU GO

1203
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,810
THROUGH THE OFFICER'S
TRAINING COURSE,

1204
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:40,814
AND THEN SAID YOU WERE
TOO OLD FOR A COMMISSION?

1205
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,315
THAT'S IT.

1206
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:45,318
WHY DIDN'T THEY
SAY THAT BEFORE?

1207
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,821
I WASN'T TOO OLD
WHEN I STARTED IT,

1208
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,823
JUST WHEN
I FINISHED IT.

1209
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:51,324
WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO BE, THEN?

1210
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,326
A CLERK.

1211
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,829
I'LL DO
A TYPING COURSE.

1212
00:56:56,329 --> 00:56:58,832
I SHALL BE
TYPING FOR ENGLAND.

1213
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:01,334

NEARLY AS NICE
AS ENGLISH JAM.

I ALWAYS SAY?

NOT TILL CHRISTMAS,
I DON'T SUPPOSE.

IN CUMBERLAND,
WE NEVER SEE AN AIR RAID.

1268
00:58:54,382 --> 00:58:55,883
MY WORST PROBLEM IS

1269
00:58:55,883 --> 00:58:57,885
GETTING A NEW
TYPEWRITER RIBBON.

1270
00:58:57,885 --> 00:59:00,388
WHEN I RODE
AGAINST THE TURKS,

1271
00:59:00,388 --> 00:59:02,890
I KNEW
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

1272
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,392
DID YOU?

1273
00:59:04,392 --> 00:59:05,893
YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

1274
00:59:06,394 --> 00:59:06,394
YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

1275
00:59:07,895 --> 00:59:10,898

NO ROSES, NO HILL,

00:59:17,405 --> 00:59:19,907
AND IT'S CERTAINLY
NOT AN AVENUE.

1280
00:59:19,907 --> 00:59:21,409
WHY NOT?

1281
00:59:21,409 --> 00:59:23,911
YOU NEED TREES
FOR AN AVENUE.

1282
00:59:23,911 --> 00:59:25,913
THERE WAS TALK
OF PLANTING SOME

IS THERE NO POINT TO IT?

01:23:31,858 --> 01:23:34,360
CAN YOU HANDLE
ANOTHER SHOCK?

1829
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,863
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A GRANDMA.

1830
01:23:36,863 --> 01:23:38,364
HELLO, GRANDMA!

01:23:38,364 --> 01:23:38,364
HELLO, GRANDMA!

I JUST DON'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING!

1833
01:23:43,369 --> 01:23:44,871
IT'S ONLY A HOUSE--

1834
01:23:44,871 --> 01:23:46,873
A GHASTLY ONE, AT THAT.

1835
01:23:47,373 --> 01:23:50,376
THEY SHOULD BE BURNED,
AND THE BUILDER HANGED!

1836
01:23:50,376 --> 01:23:54,380
WHAT DID I DO
TO DESERVE THAT?

1837
01:23:54,380 --> 01:23:57,383
YOU MARRIED THAT FOOL
CLIVE, THAT'S WHAT!

1838
01:23:57,383 --> 01:23:59,385
NEVER MIND,
NEVER MIND.

1839
01:23:59,385 --> 01:24:01,387
YOU CAN STAY WITH US.

1840
01:24:01,387 --> 01:24:02,889
HOW LONG?

1841
01:24:02,889 --> 01:24:04,390
THREE AND A HALF
MONTHS.

1842
01:24:04,891 --> 01:24:07,894
AS LONG AS THAT?
ALL RIGHT, WHY NOT?

1843
01:24:07,894 --> 01:24:10,897
IT'S NEARLY SUMMER.
LET THE NIPPERS RUN WILD.

1844
01:24:10,897 --> 01:24:10,897
IT'S NEARLY SUMMER.
LET THE NIPPERS RUN WILD.

WHA--

1847
01:24:20,907 --> 01:24:24,410
WHAT WOULD I HAVE DONE
WITHOUT YOU?

1848
01:24:24,410 --> 01:24:26,913
YOU MIGHT STILL
HAVE A HOUSE.

1849
01:24:27,413 --> 01:24:30,416
I WISH IT ALL COULD
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

1850
01:24:30,416 --> 01:24:30,917
I WISH IT ALL COULD
HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT.

01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:05,952
IS IN THIS LITTLE BOAT.

1859
01:25:05,952 --> 01:25:08,955
CAN I HAVE A TRY?

1860
01:25:08,955 --> 01:25:10,957
PUT YOUR HAND ON MINE.

1861

I SHALL TEACH YOU
THE WAYS OF THE RIVER.

HEAR ANYTHING.

1874
01:26:22,528 --> 01:26:24,530
OOH! YOU'RE
FREEZING COLD!

1875
01:26:24,530 --> 01:26:27,033
A SHOCK LIKE THAT

1876
01:26:27,033 --> 01:26:30,036
COULD GIVE ME
A MISCARRIAGE!

1877
01:26:30,036 --> 01:26:30,036
COULD GIVE ME
A MISCARRIAGE!

THAT'S AN IDEA.

1991
01:32:03,703 --> 01:32:05,204
AFTERNOON, FAITH.

1992
01:32:05,204 --> 01:32:05,204
AFTERNOON, FAITH.

1993
01:32:06,706 --> 01:32:09,208
AH, ALL HENS
AND NO COCKS.

1994
01:32:09,208 --> 01:32:11,711
TOO MANY WOMEN
IN OUR FAMILY.

1995
01:32:11,711 --> 01:32:14,714
THEY'RE A DIFFERENT
SPECIES FROM US, BILL.

1996
01:32:14,714 --> 01:32:16,716
DON'T YOU LOVE THEM?

1997
01:32:16,716 --> 01:32:18,718
OH, YES, LOVE THEM,

1998
01:32:18,718 --> 01:32:21,220
BUT DON'T TRY
TO UNDERSTAND THEM.

1999
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:23,222
THAT ROAD LEADS TO RUIN!

2000
01:32:23,222 --> 01:32:26,726
YOU SAID WE COULD
HAVE A GAME OF CRICKET.

2001
01:32:26,726 --> 01:32:28,728
SO I DID. COME ON.

2002
01:32:28,728 --> 01:32:28,728
SO I DID. COME ON.

2003
01:32:35,735 --> 01:32:38,237
YOU DON'T WANT IT?

2004
01:32:38,738 --> 01:32:40,740
YOU LOOK FRUSTRATED,
FAITHIE.

2005
01:32:40,740 --> 01:32:42,241
THAT HUSBAND OF YOURS

2006
01:32:42,241 --> 01:32:44,744
STILL CAN'T RISE
TO THE OCCASION?

2007
01:32:44,744 --> 01:32:46,746
HE SHOULD BE
LOCKED UP.

2008
01:32:46,746 --> 01:32:49,749
DON'T LET HIM
GET HOLD OF BILLY.

2009
01:32:49,749 --> 01:32:52,251
I WON'T HAVE
THE HUSBANDS HERE.

2010
01:32:52,251 --> 01:32:56,756
ALL FOUR GIRLS MARRIED DUDS,
INCLUDING YOUR MOTHER.

2011
01:32:56,756 --> 01:32:59,258
THEY'LL TAME YOU
IF THEY CAN,

2012
01:32:59,258 --> 01:33:01,761
CAGE YOU,
FEED YOU TIDBITS.

2013
01:33:01,761 --> 01:33:03,763
I BAT FIRST.

2014
01:33:03,763 --> 01:33:03,763
I BAT FIRST.

2015
01:33:05,765 --> 01:33:09,268
COME ALONG, MY DEARS.
TEA'S READY.

2016
01:33:09,268 --> 01:33:10,770
MIDDLE OF THE LANE?

2017
01:33:11,270 --> 01:33:11,270
MIDDLE OF THE LANE?

2018
01:33:41,300 --> 01:33:44,303
6 AND OUT
IN THE RIVER, GRANDPA?

2019
01:33:44,303 --> 01:33:45,805
CERTAINLY NOT!

2020
01:33:45,805 --> 01:33:45,805
CERTAINLY NOT!

2021
01:33:57,316 --> 01:33:59,318
YES!

2022
01:33:59,318 --> 01:34:00,820
THAT WAS A GOOGLIE!

2023
01:34:00,820 --> 01:34:03,322
I KNOW.

2024
01:34:03,322 --> 01:34:04,824
YOU'RE A DARK HORSE,

2025
01:34:04,824 --> 01:34:06,826
BOWLING GOOGLIES
AT YOUR AGE.

2026
01:34:06,826 --> 01:34:09,328
TOSS ME UP ANOTHER.

2027
01:34:09,328 --> 01:34:09,328
TOSS ME UP ANOTHER.

2028
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,832
NO, GRANDPA.
YOU'RE OUT.

2029
01:34:12,832 --> 01:34:13,833
IT'S MY TURN.

2030
01:34:14,333 --> 01:34:18,337
AAH. MAY
A THOUSAND CURSES...

2031
01:34:18,337 --> 01:34:18,337
AAH. MAY
A THOUSAND CURSES...

2032
01:34:34,854 --> 01:34:35,855
READY?

2033
01:34:36,355 --> 01:34:36,355
READY?

2034
01:34:42,361 --> 01:34:43,362
ARRGH!

2035
01:34:43,362 --> 01:34:43,362
ARRGH!

2036
01:34:45,364 --> 01:34:46,866
UH!

2037
01:34:47,366 --> 01:34:47,366
UH!

2038
01:34:50,369 --> 01:34:51,871
2!

2039
01:34:52,371 --> 01:34:52,371
2!

2040
01:34:54,874 --> 01:34:56,375
HAH! HOO! OH!

2041
01:34:56,375 --> 01:34:57,877
4!

2042
01:34:57,877 --> 01:35:00,379
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY THEY'RE CALLED

2043
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:03,883
FAITH, HOPE, GRACE, 
AND CHARITY?

2044
01:35:03,883 --> 01:35:06,385
6. WHY?

2045
01:35:06,385 --> 01:35:10,890
YOUR GRANDMOTHER NAMED THEM 
AFTER THE VIRTUES I LACK.

2046
01:35:10,890 --> 01:35:12,391
8!

2047
01:35:12,391 --> 01:35:13,392
8?

2048
01:35:13,893 --> 01:35:15,895
ARRR! DAMNED IMPOSSIBLE,
LAD.

2049
01:35:15,895 --> 01:35:18,397
MUMMY, CAN I HAVE
THE YELLOW CAKE?

2050
01:35:18,898 --> 01:35:19,899
YES, DARLING.

2051
01:35:20,399 --> 01:35:21,400
WHATEVER YOU'D LIKE.

2052
01:35:21,901 --> 01:35:25,404
IT'S SO WONDERFUL
TO HAVE YOU ALL HERE.

2053
01:35:25,404 --> 01:35:25,404
IT'S SO WONDERFUL
TO HAVE YOU ALL HERE.

2054
01:35:31,911 --> 01:35:32,411
YAAH!

2055
01:35:32,912 --> 01:35:32,912
YAAH!

2056
01:35:33,913 --> 01:35:35,915
AH!

2057
01:35:36,415 --> 01:35:40,419
BLAST YOU, I AIN'T
DONE WITH THIS!

2058
01:35:40,920 --> 01:35:41,921
2.

2059
01:35:42,421 --> 01:35:44,423
DAMNED CHILD!

2060
01:35:44,423 --> 01:35:44,423
DAMNED CHILD!

2061
01:35:46,425 --> 01:35:47,927
4.

2062
01:35:48,427 --> 01:35:50,429
UH! UH!

2063
01:35:50,429 --> 01:35:50,429
UH! UH!

2064
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:03,943
LOST BALL!
STOP RUNNING!

2065
01:36:03,943 --> 01:36:06,445
IT'S ONLY A GAME,
GRANDPA.

2066
01:36:06,445 --> 01:36:06,946
IT'S ONLY A GAME,
GRANDPA.

2067
01:36:08,447 --> 01:36:11,951
6 AND OUT! 6 AND OUT!

2068
01:36:11,951 --> 01:36:14,954
AND THOSE CLOTHES
ARE REALLY GOOD.

2069
01:36:14,954 --> 01:36:18,457
THIS IS JUST
LIKE OLD TIMES.

2070
01:36:18,457 --> 01:36:18,457
THIS IS JUST
LIKE OLD TIMES.

2071
01:36:48,988 --> 01:36:50,489
WHERE'S THE FISH?

2072
01:36:50,489 --> 01:36:52,491
WE GOT SOME EGGS,
GRANDPA.

2073
01:36:52,491 --> 01:36:53,993
NEVER MIND THE EGGS.

2074
01:36:54,493 --> 01:36:57,496
CATCH SOME FISH!
BE OFF WITH YOU!

2075
01:36:57,496 --> 01:36:59,498
AND DON'T COME BACK
EMPTY-HANDED,

2076
01:36:59,999 --> 01:37:01,500
OR THERE'S NO SUPPER.

2077
01:37:02,001 --> 01:37:02,001
OR THERE'S NO SUPPER.

2078
01:37:04,003 --> 01:37:06,505
RRR...

2079
01:37:06,505 --> 01:37:06,505
RRR...

2080
01:37:23,022 --> 01:37:25,024
DID YOU GET
A BITE, BILL?

2081
01:37:25,524 --> 01:37:26,525
NO. DID YOU?

2082
01:37:27,026 --> 01:37:28,027
NO.

2083
01:37:28,527 --> 01:37:28,527
NO.

2084
01:37:59,558 --> 01:38:03,062
I'M SCARED TO GO BACK
WITHOUT ANY FISH.

2085
01:38:03,562 --> 01:38:04,563
IHATEGRANDPA!

2086
01:38:05,064 --> 01:38:05,064
IHATEGRANDPA!

2087
01:38:11,070 --> 01:38:12,571
[AIRPLANE]

2088
01:38:12,571 --> 01:38:12,571
[AIRPLANE]

2089
01:38:17,576 --> 01:38:19,078
A STRAY BOMBER!

2090
01:38:19,578 --> 01:38:23,082
GERMAN. MUST HAVE LOST
HIS SQUADRON.

2091
01:38:23,082 --> 01:38:23,082
GERMAN. MUST HAVE LOST
HIS SQUADRON.

2092
01:38:26,585 --> 01:38:28,587
[BOOM!]

2093
01:38:28,587 --> 01:38:28,587
[BOOM!]

2094
01:38:35,594 --> 01:38:38,097
FISH! BELLY UP
OUT THERE!

2095
01:38:38,597 --> 01:38:38,597
FISH! BELLY UP
OUT THERE!

2096
01:38:52,111 --> 01:38:54,613
THIS IS GOING TOO FAR,
YOUNG MAN.

2097
01:38:55,114 --> 01:38:56,615
BUT YOU SAID,
GRANDPA!

2098
01:38:57,116 --> 01:39:01,620
I CONCEDE
I WAS INSISTENT,

2099
01:39:01,620 --> 01:39:03,622
BUT HOW THE DEVIL--

2100
01:39:04,123 --> 01:39:05,124
DADA, IT'S WONDERFUL!

2101
01:39:05,624 --> 01:39:07,626
LOOKS A BIT FISHY
TO ME.

2102
01:39:08,127 --> 01:39:10,629
COULD WE SALT THEM
OR SMOKE THEM, DO YOU THINK?

2103
01:39:10,629 --> 01:39:13,632
IT'S LIKE THE FEEDING
OF THE 5,000.

2104
01:39:14,133 --> 01:39:15,134
IT'S A MIRACLE!

2105
01:39:15,634 --> 01:39:18,137
SO IT'S MIRACLES NOW,
IS IT?

2106
01:39:18,637 --> 01:39:19,638
IT'LL STINK!

2107
01:39:20,139 --> 01:39:23,142
WHY DON'T YOU INVITE YOUR
FRIENDS ROUND, GRANDPA?

2108
01:39:23,642 --> 01:39:25,644
I HAVE NO FRIENDS,
ONLY RELATIONS.

2109
01:39:26,145 --> 01:39:28,147
OH, DADA!

2110
01:39:28,147 --> 01:39:28,147
OH, DADA!

2111
01:39:35,154 --> 01:39:36,655
DAWN!

2112
01:39:36,655 --> 01:39:40,159
DAWN, IT'S ME!

2113
01:39:40,159 --> 01:39:40,159
DAWN, IT'S ME!

2114
01:39:42,661 --> 01:39:44,663
JUST IGNORE HIM.

2115
01:39:44,663 --> 01:39:46,665
BILL!

2116
01:39:46,665 --> 01:39:46,665
BILL!

2117
01:39:49,668 --> 01:39:50,669
BILL!

2118
01:39:51,170 --> 01:39:53,672
BILL, WILL YOU BRING
THAT CANOE OVER HERE?

2119
01:39:54,173 --> 01:39:57,676
KEEP GOING, BILLY.
STICK TO THIS BANK.

2120
01:39:57,676 --> 01:39:57,676
KEEP GOING, BILLY.
STICK TO THIS BANK.

2121
01:40:01,180 --> 01:40:03,182
COME ON!

2122
01:40:03,182 --> 01:40:07,686
WILL YOU GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN?

2123
01:40:07,686 --> 01:40:07,686
WILL YOU GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN?

2124
01:40:10,689 --> 01:40:13,692
FASTER, BILLY, FASTER.

2125
01:40:13,692 --> 01:40:13,692
FASTER, BILLY, FASTER.

2126
01:40:19,698 --> 01:40:22,701
DAWN! SUSIE!

2127
01:40:22,701 --> 01:40:22,701
DAWN! SUSIE!

2128
01:40:25,204 --> 01:40:28,207
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU,
SUE ROWAN.

2129
01:40:28,707 --> 01:40:28,707
I'M GOING TO KILL YOU,
SUE ROWAN.

2130
01:40:37,216 --> 01:40:38,717
DAWN!

2131
01:40:39,218 --> 01:40:39,218
DAWN!

2132
01:40:41,220 --> 01:40:44,223
I COULDN'T WRITE.
IT WAS A SECRET POSTING.

2133
01:40:44,223 --> 01:40:48,227
I CAME AS SOON AS
I HEARD ABOUT THE BABY.

2134
01:40:48,227 --> 01:40:49,728
GO AWAY!

2135
01:40:49,728 --> 01:40:50,729
I'VE DESERTED.

2136
01:40:50,729 --> 01:40:53,232
I WENT AWOL
TO BE WITH YOU.

2137
01:40:53,232 --> 01:40:54,733
I HATE YOU!

2138
01:40:54,733 --> 01:40:54,733
I HATE YOU!

2139
01:40:56,735 --> 01:40:58,737
BRUCE!

2140
01:40:58,737 --> 01:41:00,739
BRUCE!

2141
01:41:00,739 --> 01:41:03,242
BRUCE! BRUCE, WHAT
HAVE I DONE?

2142
01:41:03,242 --> 01:41:07,246
NOBODY CAN HOLD
THEIR BREATHTHATLONG.

2143
01:41:07,246 --> 01:41:10,749
OH! BRUCE!

2144
01:41:11,250 --> 01:41:11,250
OH! BRUCE!

2145
01:41:17,756 --> 01:41:20,259
I'VE MISSED YOU.
I'VE MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

2146
01:41:20,259 --> 01:41:22,261
I'VE MISSED YOU, BABY.

2147
01:41:22,261 --> 01:41:22,261
I'VE MISSED YOU, BABY.

2148
01:41:24,763 --> 01:41:26,265
OH...

2149
01:41:26,265 --> 01:41:26,265
OH...

2150
01:41:27,266 --> 01:41:29,268
[CHEERING]

2151
01:41:29,268 --> 01:41:29,268
[CHEERING]

2152
01:41:30,769 --> 01:41:32,771
SO GLAD
YOU COULD COME.

2153
