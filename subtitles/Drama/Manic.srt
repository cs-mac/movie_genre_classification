1
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,033
Go ahead and turn your head
a little bit.

2
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,545
I'm going
to clean this off.

3
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:55,420
And let me just take a look
at it a little bit closer here.

4
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,046
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,984
I'm going to put
a little bandage on that.

6
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:07,492
Does this hurt?

7
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,232
I'm fine.

8
00:01:14,441 --> 00:01:16,170
- Got it?
- Yeah.

9
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:21,012
How you doing, Lyle?

10
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,845
I'm David Monroe.
I'm the staff psychologist here.

11
00:01:25,985 --> 00:01:26,952
Punk.

12
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,045
Did you get your ass kicked?

13
00:01:29,122 --> 00:01:30,919
- No.
- No?

14
00:01:35,628 --> 00:01:38,392
What's that?
Was it cigarettes?

15
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,963
You smoke out, huh?

16
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:44,765
Yeah. I've done that before.

17
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,408
- Angel dust?
- Never.

18
00:01:49,476 --> 00:01:51,171
Speed? Methamphetamine?

19
00:01:51,244 --> 00:01:53,337
- Crank? 'Shrooms?
- No, no, no.

20
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:55,347
So, were you high today?

21
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:57,713
- No.
- Didn't get high today?

22
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,513
Get up.

23
00:01:59,586 --> 00:02:00,848
Fuck off!

24
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,512
You just pissed?

25
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,428
Kind of like
how you feel right now?

26
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:12,465
It's kind of coming off
of you in waves, Lyle.

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,762
Where's my mom?

28
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,204
OK. I'll be back in a second.

29
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:29,105
What the fuck is this?

30
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:30,444
Just stay cool
for a minute, Lyle, OK?

31
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:32,678
Let me explain. You committed
criminal assault today.

32
00:02:32,752 --> 00:02:34,379
No, that's bullshit.

33
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:36,422
What were going to do right now
is take a trip to the unit.

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,751
Now, how you get there
is up to you.

35
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,951
- I'm not fucking crazy.
- I'm not saying that...

36
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:41,152
but you can walk
with Charlie...

37
00:02:41,227 --> 00:02:43,218
- Mom, what the hell?
- Or they can carry you.

38
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:44,923
Mom, just tell them
I'm not crazy!

39
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,932
- That's the way it's gonna go.
- Mom!

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,092
- Guys...
- Mom!

41
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,192
Come on, just relax.
Come with us.

42
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,201
Come on, chief.

43
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,202
- Hey, fuck you!
- Take it easy!

44
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,795
- Take it easy!
- Hey, fuck you!

45
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,066
- Come on!
- Fuck off!

46
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,438
Mom, tell them I'm not crazy!

47
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,669
Mom!

48
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,041
- Mom!
- Sorry, Lyle.

49
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:01,740
Don't fucking touch me!
Don't fucking touch me!

50
00:03:01,814 --> 00:03:02,906
Mom!

51
00:03:06,152 --> 00:03:09,144
No! Get off me!

52
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,253
Get off me!

53
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,995
No problem.

54
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,482
Who are you?

55
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:32,830
Kenny.

56
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,592
Everything OK?

57
00:05:49,282 --> 00:05:51,409
What is that?

58
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:56,717
It's a medicine pouch
my dad gave me...

59
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:00,850
to protect me from evil,
bad things.

60
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:04,959
How old are you?

61
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,824
Almost thirteen.

62
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:12,166
Why am I fucking shoeless?

63
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:15,173
We get them back
for recreation.

64
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,782
And so my mom said
we couldn't go downstairs...

65
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,116
and I said, you know,
"Why not? What's the problem?"

66
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,018
You know?
She said, "Oh, well...

67
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,319
"you know, young ladies
don't hang out on the streets...

68
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,826
"at 5:00 in the morning."

69
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,124
So, I was like, "Fuck that,"
you know? "I'm going outside."

70
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:40,222
And so I went to go outside,
and she grabbed me.

71
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,096
And I said, "I want
to get the fuck out of here."

72
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:46,366
And she went pfft!
And smacked me across the face.

73
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,532
And, you know, what,
just because she's my mom...

74
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,269
I'm not supposed
to hit her back?

75
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:54,780
So... you know, I turned around,
and I went crack.

76
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:57,213
And then, you know,
she threw me into the wall...

77
00:06:57,283 --> 00:07:00,411
and I slammed my head
and fell on the floor.

78
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:01,976
And she was just like...

79
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:06,388
Is this the first time that you
and your mother had a fight...

80
00:07:06,459 --> 00:07:07,824
where it became physical?

81
00:07:07,894 --> 00:07:11,990
Yeah. That was the first time
she actually, like, hit me.

82
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,998
- And you hit back?
- And the last time.

83
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,226
- And the last time?
- Yeah.

84
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:16,233
Why do you say that?

85
00:07:16,302 --> 00:07:18,702
Well, because I don't think
she expected me to hit her back.

86
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,103
You know?

87
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,540
I mean,
an eye for an eye, right?

88
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:27,045
I mean, if somebody hit you,
you'd hit them back, right?

89
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:31,049
I have. It hasn't always
solved the problem.

90
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,984
All right, but at that moment,
you're not thinking that.

91
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,851
That's what we're talking about,
though, is, in those moments...

92
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:41,257
how to, you know,
apply your brain.

93
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,989
I mean, that's why you're here
with us right now, right?

94
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,364
Does that sound like
anything that's happened...

95
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:48,923
with anybody else
at their house?

96
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,094
- It's happened with everybody.
- Yeah.

97
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,104
You got to stand up
for yourself.

98
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,504
- Parents included.
- Parents are the worst.

99
00:07:55,575 --> 00:07:57,736
You know, I do one little thing
and the motherfucker gets mad.

100
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,971
Next thing I know, I'm in here
with you crazy motherfuckers.

101
00:08:00,046 --> 00:08:01,411
You know what I'm saying?
It's bullshit.

102
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,574
I'll knock a motherfucker out.
I don't give a fuck.

103
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,776
Bitch, I swear to God.
Don't look at me like that.

104
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,821
- Why don't you lick me, dyke?
- You guys. Hey, Mike...

105
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,617
I don't want to hear that
out of your mouth again.

106
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:13,386
I don't care what
the excuse is, all right?

107
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:17,790
You all know we have
someone here new with us.

108
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,300
This is Lyle Jensen.
He's going to be here with us.

109
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,232
Just show him the ropes.

110
00:08:23,302 --> 00:08:25,133
Let him know
how we do things here.

111
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,535
Show him your arm.

112
00:08:26,606 --> 00:08:28,005
This is bad-ass.

113
00:08:28,074 --> 00:08:29,769
That shit is nasty.

114
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,309
That's fucking sweet.

115
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:34,141
- You like it?
- It's fucking gross, yo.

116
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,738
OK, OK. Tracey...

117
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,011
you want to talk to us today?

118
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:47,549
- I'm Tracey.
- No shit, genius.

119
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:50,255
Shut the fuck up.
What is wrong with you, OK?

120
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,490
OK, who wants to level drop?

121
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:58,604
Go ahead, Tracey.

122
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:03,103
I'm working on my self-esteem.

123
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:05,143
Thank you, Tracey.

124
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,736
Lyle, you want to try it?

125
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:10,304
Why are you here?

126
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,174
You want to tell us
why you're here?

127
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,918
Lyle is working on
his anger management.

128
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,515
I heard Lyle got
in a fucked-up fight...

129
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,754
with a baseball bat
and, like, killed some kid.

130
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:25,058
- Hell, no.
- Yeah, I heard that, too.

131
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,826
That's bullshit. Look at him.

132
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,264
What you weigh,
about a buck twenty?

133
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,098
You had to get a baseball bat?
Did they take your lunch money?

134
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,661
Mike. You want
to talk about it, Lyle?

135
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,432
Big bad-ass fighting machine.

136
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,636
Do you know how close you are
to a level drop, Mike?

137
00:09:38,711 --> 00:09:40,042
You've gotten one
already last week.

138
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:42,842
You want one this week, too?
Come on, Lyle.

139
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,212
I'll fucking kill you.

140
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:45,580
Come on. Come on, then.
Get the fuck up.

141
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:47,619
- Guys.
- Baby.

142
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,145
- Mike.
- All right.

143
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:54,317
OK. Maybe later.

144
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,945
Give it up.

145
00:10:25,091 --> 00:10:26,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,373
Go ahead.

147
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,706
What?

148
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,974
That's what I thought.

149
00:11:00,926 --> 00:11:02,086
I'm not crazy.

150
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,419
I'm not crazy. I'm...

151
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,500
Here, here, here.

152
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:28,446
- Traveling. Give it up.
- It went out.

153
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,318
Bullshit. Give me the ball,
you little faggot punk.

154
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,949
- Yo, dude, Mike, relax, dude.
- Are you calling me a liar?

155
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,585
- It hit the fence. It's out.
- Man, give me the fucking ball.

156
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,060
It went the fuck out.

157
00:11:37,129 --> 00:11:38,187
All right,
let's go, little man.

158
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:43,759
Dudes, dudes, like techs
all over the place. Relax.

159
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,996
Come on.

160
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:47,005
Fucking relax.

161
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:48,233
Let's play. Come on.

162
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,935
OK, let's play.

163
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,251
Hey, be cool.

164
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,084
Break it up.

165
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,384
Hey, break it up,
break it up, break it up.

166
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,085
I'm gonna fucking
kill you, bitch!

167
00:12:07,159 --> 00:12:08,820
What the fuck was that, huh?

168
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,361
You want to fight,
let's fucking fight!

169
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,829
- He started it!
- Come on! I don't care!

170
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,866
Fucking bitch shit, huh?
You fuck...

171
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:18,028
All right. Just chill. Goddamn.

172
00:12:18,104 --> 00:12:19,662
Damn it!

173
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,671
He fucking started it, man.

174
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,537
I don't care who started
this shit, man.

175
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,633
Get up against the...

176
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:26,041
Get the fuck off!

177
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,977
- Relax.
- Get the fuck off!

178
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,044
Yeah, come in. It's open.

179
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:35,011
Hey, Lyle,
you mind sitting down?

180
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,559
Did you lock him up?

181
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:45,563
Yeah. We'll give him
a couple hours to cool off.

182
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,335
Are you going to lock me up?

183
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:52,836
I wasn't planning on it.

184
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,372
Michael's a big guy.

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,374
You're lucky the staff
showed up when they did.

186
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,741
He's a fucking pussy.

187
00:13:01,747 --> 00:13:02,839
How'd you feel
during the fight?

188
00:13:02,915 --> 00:13:05,850
I mean, you must've had
a pretty good rush.

189
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:06,885
Can I get out of here soon?

190
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,920
You got work to do, Lyle.

191
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:11,422
You don't think you chose
the actions that caused you...

192
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:13,185
to be in this room right now
sitting in front of me?

193
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,248
I didn't choose to be here.

194
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:15,793
You didn't choose to bash
that kid's head in...

195
00:13:15,861 --> 00:13:17,055
with a baseball bat?

196
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,168
Yeah, you can give me the silent
treatment if you want to, and...

197
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:26,602
you know how to do it.
You're good at it.

198
00:13:26,672 --> 00:13:29,573
I'm sure you've done it before,
and it's worked for you.

199
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,772
Sooner or later, you're going
to have to think about yourself.

200
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:36,337
There's not much else
to do here.

201
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,679
Lyle jumps up,
flies over to them...

202
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,549
and he's just, like,
boom! Boom! Boom!

203
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,056
Fucked him up, man.
Fucked him up.

204
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:50,790
Ladies and gentlemen...

205
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:54,355
the ultimate fighting champion
of the Northwood psycho ward.

206
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:55,832
That was bad-ass.

207
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:02,606
Did he bust you down?
Did he give you a drop?

208
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,007
Because I was totally
arguing your case.

209
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:23,954
Foosball anarchy!

210
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:26,088
What are you...

211
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:35,767
Bad-ass.

212
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:18,339
Rumble!

213
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:19,975
Get up.

214
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,076
Get up.

215
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:22,245
Fuck off!

216
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,166
Get him off me!

217
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,708
Oh, shit!

218
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:11,899
Fuck! Let me go!

219
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:40,022
Dude, this one time, a girl
got put into isolation, right?

220
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,999
They juiced her up bad.

221
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,035
But when she woke up,
she was pissed...

222
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,264
and she started
kicking the door, right?

223
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:48,169
And they didn't even care
at first 'cause, like...

224
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,434
they didn't think
anything of it.

225
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,306
But she just kept kicking
the door and ramming into it...

226
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:54,209
and she knocked it
off the hinges, dude.

227
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:55,439
Bullshit.

228
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,981
- It opened, dude.
- No way.

229
00:16:57,049 --> 00:16:58,482
Yeah, dude,
she just ran out.

230
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:00,245
- Seriously?
- She knocked it off.

231
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:03,049
Is she, like,
Big Bertha or something?

232
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,181
Do you just cut yourself
for no reason?

233
00:17:05,257 --> 00:17:07,657
No, there's always a reason.

234
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:10,695
It probably had to be
seventh grade.

235
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:13,231
I remember.
I was taking a shower.

236
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,267
And I tried O.D.'ing
before that.

237
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,362
I was taking a shower, you know,
just shaving, and I cut...

238
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:22,407
and I didn't stop.

239
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,533
I just let it keep going
up my leg.

240
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,408
And it was the most relief
I'd ever felt in my life...

241
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:31,006
and so I just kept cutting
since then.

242
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,778
On your thighs?

243
00:17:37,423 --> 00:17:39,391
I have an anarchy sign
right there.

244
00:17:45,197 --> 00:17:49,293
It looks like someone
branded your leg.

245
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:47,249
Get back in your room.

246
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,964
Honey, wake up.

247
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,764
Tracey, you're dreaming.

248
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:03,638
Come on.

249
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,267
Come on.

250
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:26,796
OK, you can go.
I got her.

251
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,968
Get back to your room.

252
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,061
All right.

253
00:19:35,274 --> 00:19:38,869
OK, there you go.

254
00:19:41,813 --> 00:19:44,077
There you go.

255
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:45,741
There you go.

256
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,512
It's OK to cry.

257
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:52,384
Mike, do we dare venture
into Mike world?

258
00:19:52,457 --> 00:19:53,549
What's goin' on?

259
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,684
What's up? Why are you here?

260
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,820
Mainly 'cause my dad's a bitch.

261
00:19:57,896 --> 00:19:59,056
What are you workin' on?

262
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:03,761
I get into fights.
I like to fight. You know?

263
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,700
I like to smoke.
I like to drink.

264
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,299
I smacked this fool
over the head with a bottle...

265
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,171
gave him six stitches.

266
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:14,110
You don't think you have
anything to work on?

267
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:16,807
No, other than getting rid
of my parents.

268
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,780
I friggin' have
the responsibility...

269
00:20:20,852 --> 00:20:24,083
of a 20-year-old, but my parents
still cram shit down my throat.

270
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,350
Yeah.

271
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,415
Like, they want to make
me do all these things...

272
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,187
that I shouldn't
be doing at sixteen...

273
00:20:29,261 --> 00:20:31,286
paying bills and shit...

274
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,354
but they still treat me
like a sixteen-year-old...

275
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:35,992
"Be home at 10:00 at night."
I'm, like...

276
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,263
Kenny.

277
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:39,531
Yeah?

278
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:43,740
You want to talk?
Why are you here?

279
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,778
I did stuff
that I shouldn't have done.

280
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:50,314
Chester the molester.

281
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,044
Shut your big,
fat fucking mouth...

282
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:55,279
- Why don't you make me?
- I'll fucking make you.

283
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,322
Yeah? Go ahead. Why don't
you get on your knees...

284
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,549
and suck
my motherfuckin' balls?

285
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,956
Get up, motherfucker.
Come on, get up.

286
00:21:01,026 --> 00:21:02,891
Sara, what are you doing?

287
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,826
Come on.
What are you, a pussy? Get up.

288
00:21:04,896 --> 00:21:08,662
I'm not fucking scared.
Go ahead, bitch. Go ahead!

289
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:10,463
What you gonna do?

290
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:11,968
What are you,
so fucking tough...

291
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,969
Kenny!

292
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,063
Kenny!

293
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,712
I found out that even though
this kid was only fourteen...

294
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,978
he already tried
to kill himself twice.

295
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,576
That means that...

296
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:31,248
OK, you're so depressed,
you're gonna kill yourself.

297
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:34,156
It's, like, yeah,
we've all been there.

298
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,387
But then you actually do it.

299
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,397
Right? You try it... twice.
And you still fuck it up.

300
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,490
You're gonna realize
you're such a loser...

301
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,091
you can't even get it right
on the second try.

302
00:21:44,169 --> 00:21:46,763
Fuck, man.
That's some fucked up shit.

303
00:21:46,838 --> 00:21:49,966
I was happy for the kid
after I heard that shit.

304
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,240
Wake up.

305
00:22:05,424 --> 00:22:07,255
Kenny.

306
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,297
It's Chad.
Tell me you're not naked.

307
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,929
Yeah. What?

308
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:55,905
Dude, you wanna go
play some ball?

309
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:59,808
Hey, can you
tell this fuck to get up?

310
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:01,311
He's fuckin' depressing me.

311
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,541
Nah, he's gonna
be there all day.

312
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:06,311
You're going, right?

313
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,319
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

314
00:23:16,128 --> 00:23:19,461
Kenny, we're gonna
go play ball.

315
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:20,896
You want to play?

316
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,397
Hey.

317
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:29,835
Get up.

318
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:33,071
Ken, get up!

319
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,010
All right.

320
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,677
I'm gonna count to three...

321
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,790
and if you don't get up...

322
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,053
I'm gonna kill you.

323
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:51,288
Don't think
I won't do it, either.

324
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:55,032
One...

325
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,692
two...

326
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:03,304
Did they tell you?

327
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,040
Did you write
these questions, Dave?

328
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:15,553
These questions were handed down
to me by Yoda, actually.

329
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:18,216
Sara?

330
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,989
"How do you deal
with your anger?"

331
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:28,757
Well, obviously,
not very well.

332
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:31,359
That's why I'm here, but...

333
00:24:31,436 --> 00:24:34,872
Is there anything that makes you
feel calm when you're angry?

334
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,568
Now it's painting...

335
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,543
that relaxes me.

336
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:44,104
That's good. That's productive.

337
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:46,150
Mike?

338
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,883
"If I had a million dollars,
I would..."

339
00:24:52,023 --> 00:24:54,355
Bitches and hos.

340
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:57,554
I'd buy myself
a big old fat house...

341
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,259
just throw a big-ass party
for me and all my homeboys.

342
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,824
Hope I can come.

343
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:07,771
Kenny?

344
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,104
"What do I like the best
about myself?"

345
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,205
I don't know.

346
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,717
"What's your favorite word,
and why?"

347
00:25:24,723 --> 00:25:26,953
My favorite word is "why."

348
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:28,959
The word never ends.

349
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,892
That's what I like about it.

350
00:25:30,962 --> 00:25:34,056
Like, my uncle told me that
I was gonna come back in here.

351
00:25:34,132 --> 00:25:36,259
And I was just, like, "Why?"

352
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,064
And he would say, "Well,
because blah blah blah blah."

353
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:41,196
And I said, "Why?"
And he said...

354
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:43,605
"Well, because
this and this and that."

355
00:25:43,675 --> 00:25:46,405
You know? It's just...
there's no answer.

356
00:25:46,478 --> 00:25:48,969
I think it's a fun word.

357
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,311
Yeah, when used properly...

358
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,682
and I bet you get a lot
of mileage out of that.

359
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:57,881
It's always used properly.

360
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,287
Why?

361
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,860
Fuck you.

362
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:04,122
Lyle?

363
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:10,190
"Who is the most important
person in your life?"

364
00:26:13,371 --> 00:26:17,307
I don't really think...

365
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,367
I've met that person yet.

366
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:24,108
But honestly, I think
it's just as well 'cause...

367
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,814
I mean, I almost hope that...

368
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,880
I almost hope that I never do
meet him 'cause if I do...

369
00:26:33,959 --> 00:26:36,860
I know they'll just
fuck me over.

370
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,121
Lauren?

371
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:42,325
"What is your family like?"

372
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:48,965
My family is like people
who live in a hotel.

373
00:26:50,408 --> 00:26:53,002
We don't know anything
about each other.

374
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,239
When we see each other,
we're cordial...

375
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:59,340
and we say hi,
but that's about it.

376
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,513
Tracey.

377
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,554
"What's the last dream
you can remember...

378
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,023
"and what do you think
it means?"

379
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,926
I was floating
in the ocean...

380
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:15,558
and it seemed like I'd been
shipwrecked or something...

381
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,829
but there was no other people.

382
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:21,861
And I couldn't move.

383
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,636
So, it was like
I was an inanimate object.

384
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,044
I was just floating...

385
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:35,280
with the swirls
of the ocean, and...

386
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:41,292
the ocean was filling in
the big cavity...

387
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,726
and I just went down with it.

388
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,732
Ended up in this mud slide...

389
00:27:49,801 --> 00:27:51,735
and I just was, like...

390
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:56,467
part of this massive force.

391
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,550
Tracey, can I talk to you
for a second?

392
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:07,983
Yeah.

393
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,618
You're still not smoking,
are you?

394
00:28:18,963 --> 00:28:21,056
All right. I'm just
checking on you, man...

395
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:22,690
because you said you quit.

396
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:24,496
You know I quit.

397
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:25,934
You got everything
in your head.

398
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:29,064
- Don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried about it, man.

399
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:32,337
- Oh, yeah? How's he doing?
- He's doing all right.

400
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,243
Everybody's angry nowadays.

401
00:28:35,313 --> 00:28:37,679
You OK with this whole
roommate situation?

402
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:42,083
I mean, it doesn't freak
you out or anything?

403
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,348
It's pretty serious stuff,
actually.

404
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,413
He was in a youth ward
for a while...

405
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:48,982
and they had
to transfer him here.

406
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,223
Wandering hands,
you know what I'm saying?

407
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,037
Lyle? You up?

408
00:29:07,178 --> 00:29:08,406
Yeah.

409
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,749
Do you like The Undertaker?

410
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,281
What, the wrestler?

411
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,457
He's the...

412
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:23,119
the scary one, right?
Like, the goth dude?

413
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,822
That's who he used to be.

414
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:27,159
Then he changed.

415
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:28,995
I think he's, like,
a Harley guy now.

416
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,557
Yeah.

417
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,647
Boys.

418
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:47,378
How's everybody feeling today?

419
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,114
Anything I can do for you guys?

420
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:53,584
Damn. The whole fucking bottle?

421
00:29:53,658 --> 00:29:55,922
Did you pass out?

422
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:59,395
No, I just started hooking up
with this guy I didn't know.

423
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,692
Open up.

424
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:03,325
Let's see, Chad.

425
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:04,698
Open.

426
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,569
I didn't even like him.

427
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,041
So, why did you fuck him
if you didn't like him?

428
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,103
Chad. Open your mouth, Chad.

429
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,346
That's a good job.

430
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:33,028
This place sucks ass.

431
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,565
It's, like,
ignorance is bliss...

432
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,897
and this place
is fucking Disneyland.

433
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,975
What do you listen to?

434
00:30:51,049 --> 00:30:55,042
Slipknot, Korn.

435
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,643
I like some punk, though.

436
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,416
I like Minor Threat. Right?

437
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:02,585
I hate ravers.
I can never go to those things.

438
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:07,154
Man, they're all this tall
and have really big clothes on.

439
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,962
That's one of the best
fucking shows I've ever seen.

440
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:13,663
Zach was, like,
going off, man.

441
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:16,070
Were you in the pit?

442
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,402
Were you in there?

443
00:31:17,475 --> 00:31:18,942
I've never seen a pit like that.

444
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,910
I saw people putting
mouth guards in...

445
00:31:20,979 --> 00:31:22,344
before that show started.

446
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,472
I was just, like,
"Yeah, man, that's L.A.!"

447
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,574
You know?
Rage Against the Machine show.

448
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:27,948
You know what
I'm talking about, right?

449
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,351
Those big, huge pacifiers
they have around their neck.

450
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,982
They look like idiots. I swear.

451
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,685
That was, like,
the baddest ending.

452
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,786
Everybody was thinking they were
gonna do "Freedom" last.

453
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,763
And then they did
"New Years Day"...

454
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,163
and it was, like...

455
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,861
God, people were just
getting nuts, man.

456
00:31:44,936 --> 00:31:46,426
Like that end part, right?

457
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:48,131
With the guitar, right?
And it's...

458
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,749
The place was just, like...

459
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,449
It was so fucking...

460
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,785
Dude, I'd be so fucking dead
without music.

461
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,091
Man, I miss getting high.

462
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:22,004
I would rather feel like
total shit sometimes...

463
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:23,870
and God the rest of the time...

464
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:27,537
than just, like, OK
all the time, you know?

465
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,074
Fuck mediocrity.

466
00:32:38,222 --> 00:32:41,020
So, what, your parents
make you come here?

467
00:32:41,092 --> 00:32:43,458
No, I don't live
with my parents.

468
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:49,699
My dad's gone, and my mom
has the same thing I do.

469
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:55,467
She's, like, fucked up,
manic-depressive, agoraphobic.

470
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,735
Right?

471
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,241
All right?

472
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:07,909
Yeah, go ahead.

473
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,648
Like, I live with
my uncle now...

474
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:13,316
Uncle Cole.

475
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,451
He's, like, this
fucking rich asshole.

476
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,052
He has all this money
and no kids...

477
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:22,156
so he thinks if he puts me
in here enough...

478
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:23,666
it'll fix whatever's broken...

479
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,694
'cause he doesn't want some
freak inheriting all his money.

480
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,605
What?

481
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:35,305
You're inheriting
a bunch of money from him?

482
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,940
How much?
Like what, a million dollars?

483
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:41,543
Yeah, something like that.
I don't know.

484
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:45,953
I can't believe
you're fucking rich, man.

485
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:51,519
We could fucking
take that money...

486
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,928
and just get the fuck
out of here.

487
00:33:56,234 --> 00:33:59,499
You're so fucking stoned.

488
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,198
No, I'm serious.

489
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:06,642
Just... you and me
just, like, go...

490
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,178
travel the world.
I don't know.

491
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:09,577
Just get the fuck
away from here...

492
00:34:09,647 --> 00:34:12,138
and get away from, like...

493
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:16,084
my mom and your uncle, right?

494
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:21,358
Go to Europe, right?

495
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,590
Dude, you and me
could go to Europe.

496
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,291
We could go to fucking Paris...

497
00:34:28,366 --> 00:34:30,334
and just fuck hookers
or something.

498
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,961
Go to Amsterdam.

499
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:36,768
Dude, you know how fucking cool
it'd be to live in Amsterdam?

500
00:34:36,841 --> 00:34:40,299
Just wake up,
do whatever you want.

501
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:43,939
No one to tell you
any kind of bullshit.

502
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:45,710
It's, like...

503
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,183
This shit's legal there.
Did you know that?

504
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:53,349
You can just go to cafes
on the street and buy it.

505
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,823
Go there and, like...

506
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:00,255
and have, like,
a real life, you know?

507
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,669
Are you scared?

508
00:35:10,741 --> 00:35:12,333
No.

509
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:16,005
Then why not?

510
00:35:20,351 --> 00:35:22,751
OK. Fine.

511
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,380
You mean, go live in Europe?

512
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:29,516
- Yeah.
- Fuck, yeah!

513
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:35,496
What?

514
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:37,625
- Nothing.
- Dude...

515
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,406
why are you smiling like that?

516
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,907
Are you fucking lying?

517
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:48,002
I turn eighteen next week,
you know?

518
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,516
I get a good chunk
of my trust fund.

519
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,383
Like, a hundred grand, dude.
No bullshit.

520
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,421
A hundred grand.

521
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,185
Don't fucking
tell anybody that.

522
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:02,419
OK.

523
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:06,827
Jesus. Put that in here.
We got to get out of here.

524
00:36:06,898 --> 00:36:09,458
It's community music hour.

525
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,593
I hate that fucking song.

526
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,489
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

527
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,067
These just came.

528
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,235
Look at those. They're pretty.

529
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:49,711
She's not even here anymore.

530
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,988
Hey, Chad?

531
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,328
What's goin' on?

532
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:12,392
Did you take your meds today?

533
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,481
I definitely think that
Amsterdam is the way to go.

534
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,350
We can live there cheap,
stay there until we get bored...

535
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:37,655
and then move on, right?

536
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,961
Hey, I'm using that.

537
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:48,601
Do you like it?

538
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,470
Yeah, I do. Yeah.

539
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:56,304
They need a credit card.

540
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:58,109
1973...

541
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,173
1737...

542
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:08,920
The name on the card
is Cole Merritt.

543
00:42:10,828 --> 00:42:12,819
What are you drawing?

544
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,065
It's this guy on a cross.

545
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:19,102
Is his name Jesus?

546
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,466
No.

547
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,269
It's not Jesus. See? He's got
all that hair on his chest.

548
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,673
Jesus didn't have
any hair on his chest.

549
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:35,309
She makes me wear really big
clothes and sweaters and stuff.

550
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:37,013
It's so fucked up.

551
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,317
I mean,
she's your mother, right?

552
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,551
It's not a competition.

553
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,192
You know, Calabasas is full
of fucking JAPs...

554
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:47,628
and little daddy's girls.

555
00:42:47,698 --> 00:42:52,431
I didn't exactly have
the debutante thing goin' on.

556
00:42:52,503 --> 00:42:55,495
One day I saw her at McDonald's
with the nose job crew.

557
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:56,665
Amsterdam.

558
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,935
That was before I knew my place,
so I sat down.

559
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:03,844
My friend rolls her eyes,
and she says, "What?

560
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:06,041
"You actually think
you're good-Iooking?

561
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,947
"'Cause you walk around
like you're all hot...

562
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,246
"and you're really not."

563
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,223
Then the whole table
started to laugh.

564
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,020
And I cried
for about three days...

565
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:19,722
and then I fuckin' resurrect.
You know?

566
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:24,860
I just realized that everyone
I knew was fucking full of shit.

567
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,834
And that's when I started
doing whatever I wanted...

568
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:31,374
and not giving a flying fuck
what people thought.

569
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,542
Fuck!

570
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,273
So I don't really have
any friends.

571
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,039
I don't need any.

572
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,019
We're friends.

573
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,488
Yeah.

574
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:55,690
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

575
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:57,393
Don't fucking call me stupid.

576
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:58,799
I didn't say
you were stupid, butch.

577
00:43:58,869 --> 00:44:00,996
I said your opinion was stupid,
because it is.

578
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:03,562
Wolverine has got steel plates
in his bones...

579
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:04,903
So what?!

580
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:06,943
And Batman has just
a little fucking belt...

581
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:08,239
and a little fucking cape.

582
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,745
What the hell
is he gonna do with that?

583
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,246
Batman is so much smarter...

584
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,976
and so much more intelligent
a fighter...

585
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:14,347
Who gives a fuck?

586
00:44:14,418 --> 00:44:17,148
He knows eight different
martial arts.

587
00:44:17,221 --> 00:44:18,688
He's, like, a ninja.

588
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:21,623
- Batman is a fucking homo.
- Batman is not a homo!

589
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:27,255
Batman bangs the hottest chicks
in Gotham City left and right.

590
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,525
He's a player!

591
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,226
Superman could
take them all down.

592
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,324
Really.

593
00:44:31,402 --> 00:44:33,302
You all need
to check your heads.

594
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:34,894
Shut up.

595
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:38,169
Hold it. I think that Lyle
brings up a good point.

596
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:41,040
Let's talk about this logically
for a second, OK?

597
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,636
Now, Batman is
an intelligent cat. No doubt.

598
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:46,205
And he is a damn good fighter.

599
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:47,978
I'll give you that.
But he's just human.

600
00:44:48,052 --> 00:44:50,987
- Oh, my God.
- Wait a minute. Let me finish.

601
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:55,287
Now, Wolverine is a flat-out
animal when he fights...

602
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,758
and he's got the skills
to pay the bills.

603
00:44:56,827 --> 00:44:58,419
He's got unbreakable
adamantium bones...

604
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,430
razor-sharp retractable
adamantium claws...

605
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,432
he's got mutant healing powers.
He's a bad-ass.

606
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,129
No doubt. He would kill Batman.
I'm sorry. Every time.

607
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,696
But, in a straight-up brawl,
Sara, toe to toe...

608
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:12,708
you know who's gonna
take home all the cookies...

609
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:13,936
if Superman's involved.

610
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,945
It's gonna be the big blue
boy scout every time.

611
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,981
No doubt. He would tear
Wolverine's head off...

612
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,572
he would tear
Batman's head off...

613
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,481
and use them
like ka-nick-ka-nacks.

614
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,180
These guys aren't even real.
What the fuck? God!

615
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:27,655
OK, OK. Well,
let's jump into reality, then.

616
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,319
You want to talk about reality?
Let's talk about real fights.

617
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,861
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

618
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:32,987
Oh, you like that?

619
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:35,122
- Yeah, dawg.
- Why?

620
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,632
I don't know. It's kinda
like fucking, you know?

621
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,792
It's just fun.

622
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,859
It's fun?
What's so fun about it?

623
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:44,704
I can't explain it, y'all.
You know, or you don't.

624
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,642
I guess that's fair enough.

625
00:45:47,711 --> 00:45:50,043
What do you think
about fights, Lyle?

626
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,243
I think you're an expert
on the subject.

627
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:54,784
He's totally an expert.

628
00:45:54,852 --> 00:45:56,149
Just ask that kid
from his school, man.

629
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:58,688
- 52 stitches, broken arm...
- Shut the fuck up, man.

630
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,485
Jaw's wired shut.
Might never see...

631
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:02,548
Hey! Shut the fuck up.

632
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:07,655
You want to talk about it?

633
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:10,165
There's nothing to say.

634
00:46:10,234 --> 00:46:14,364
You certainly had something
to say on that day.

635
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:16,133
Don't you think
that's why you're here?

636
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:17,230
I don't know why I'm here.

637
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:19,138
You tell me,
'cause I feel fine.

638
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:21,871
Please. If you were fine,
you wouldn't be sitting here.

639
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,412
Why don't you just
tell us what happened...

640
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,641
so we can stop assuming?
I mean, what...

641
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,911
did you just freak out?
It's not a big deal.

642
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,475
I did that one time.
I took a hammer...

643
00:46:29,553 --> 00:46:31,180
and I smashed all the windows
on the minivan.

644
00:46:31,255 --> 00:46:33,746
No, I had a reason. I don't
just do shit for no reason.

645
00:46:33,824 --> 00:46:35,018
What was your reason?

646
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,753
It's none of your
fucking business.

647
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,058
You know, I sure can't
make you tell me, Lyle...

648
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,064
but I would really
like to know...

649
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,430
what you think justifies
hurting someone...

650
00:46:44,501 --> 00:46:47,436
to the point where
you almost kill them.

651
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:52,738
I'm just curious
how someone...

652
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,438
as seemingly
intelligent as you...

653
00:46:55,512 --> 00:46:57,810
could hurt another
human being that bad...

654
00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:00,577
and have no remorse
for it whatsoever.

655
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,415
He deserved it.

656
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:05,546
Well, I bet Chris Woods
would say it differently...

657
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:07,613
if his jaw wasn't wired shut.

658
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,929
What did he say?

659
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:18,434
He said something mean.

660
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:31,105
My dad beat me up a few times
when I was a kid.

661
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:37,350
And this guy Chris
knew about it.

662
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:39,753
He thought
it was really funny.

663
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:42,792
Now he doesn't think
it's so funny.

664
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:49,424
If you say you wouldn't
do the same thing...

665
00:47:49,499 --> 00:47:51,091
you're fucking lying.

666
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,193
Or just a pussy.

667
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:56,802
Do you remember your dad, Lyle?

668
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,808
Yeah.

669
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:04,644
How did you feel about him?
Did you love him?

670
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,478
He was my dad.

671
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,347
No feeling
one way or the other?

672
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:14,049
Just a genetic bond?

673
00:48:14,124 --> 00:48:18,527
My mom never hits me.
She just is always saying...

674
00:48:18,595 --> 00:48:20,825
really, really
horrible things to me.

675
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:27,364
It sounds kind of stupid
next to Lyle's, but...

676
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,564
if anyone said
anything about it...

677
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:32,268
I'd want to hurt them, too.

678
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:34,310
That's not stupid.

679
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,878
Go ahead.
Say more about that, Tracey.

680
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:45,249
She tells me how stupid I am,
how I'm a slut...

681
00:48:45,322 --> 00:48:48,189
and she wishes I wasn't born.

682
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:55,391
Anyways, I kind of understand
what Lyle means.

683
00:48:55,465 --> 00:48:59,526
It's really none of
anybody else's business.

684
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,844
I wasn't sure if that was a bird
or that crazy dude over there.

685
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,477
That guy is insane.

686
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:21,217
That's what they say
about all of us though.

687
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,665
What happens to you at night?

688
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:45,541
It's like I'm...

689
00:49:45,615 --> 00:49:48,812
surrounded with...

690
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,018
badness, like in a war
or something.

691
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:56,184
In here?

692
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,429
It happens everywhere.

693
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,259
Did you get raped?

694
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:13,270
If you ever want someone
to kill him, I'll do it.

695
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,775
Thanks.

696
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,678
I'm scared of you sometimes.

697
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:55,809
Does that make sense?

698
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,491
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

699
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,920
I'm scared of myself sometimes.

700
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:11,457
This one time,
my mom and I were in a fight.

701
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:16,234
And we were just yelling
at each other, and, like...

702
00:51:16,306 --> 00:51:17,796
she was standing
with her back...

703
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,638
to a cabinet in the kitchen.

704
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,268
And I just...

705
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,685
I kind of like
punched through it.

706
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:33,288
You know, beside her.

707
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:38,123
I didn't want to do that.

708
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:41,790
Then she started crying.

709
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,301
She said,
"You look just like him."

710
00:51:54,010 --> 00:51:55,807
I'm not.

711
00:51:58,482 --> 00:51:59,471
I'm not.

712
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,252
It's OK.

713
00:52:06,523 --> 00:52:08,753
I'll never hurt you.

714
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:21,265
Then, boom... I'm just standing
right in front of myself...

715
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,772
except it's not totally me.

716
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,569
And I look down...

717
00:52:25,642 --> 00:52:29,043
and I'm holding,
like, this bad-ass knife,

718
00:52:29,112 --> 00:52:31,512
and it's all, like,
sharp and everything...

719
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,209
and clean.
I can, like, see myself in it.

720
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:36,149
And all of the sudden,
like, Chad 2 turns around...

721
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,052
and takes off running,
so I take off after him.

722
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:40,953
And then I get him,
and I fucking jump on him...

723
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:43,219
and I pounce on his ass, and
I get him down on the ground.

724
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:48,595
And now he's got a knife, too,
so I'm just like...

725
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,997
And there's fucking blood
all over the place.

726
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,262
And he smiles at me.

727
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,737
And all the blood
goes back in his body...

728
00:52:56,806 --> 00:53:00,298
and all the stab wounds,
like, all close up and shit.

729
00:53:00,377 --> 00:53:02,641
He gives me a second
to catch my breath...

730
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:06,705
takes off running again,
so I go after him again...

731
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,978
stab him, like, 200 times.

732
00:53:09,052 --> 00:53:11,350
The cuts all close up,
blood all goes away.

733
00:53:11,421 --> 00:53:16,120
I just know it's going
to go on forever.

734
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:20,092
That's it.

735
00:53:21,264 --> 00:53:23,425
What do you guys
think it means?

736
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:27,197
I think it means Chad needs
to be on 24-hour watch.

737
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:29,295
It means your shit
is fucked up, yo.

738
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,863
No, that's not what it means.

739
00:53:31,942 --> 00:53:33,773
What does it mean, Lyle?

740
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,172
It means nothing changes.

741
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,183
Lyle, things change
all the time.

742
00:53:41,251 --> 00:53:44,516
Yeah. When you have a problem,
you fix it.

743
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,818
Then you get another problem.
You fix that.

744
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,585
Then another problem.
You fix that.

745
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,421
It's like this place,
you know what I'm saying?

746
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,462
You get out, you come back.
You get out, you come back.

747
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:56,761
It's true. The same shit just
keeps happening over and over...

748
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:01,167
and then we die.
That's just the way it is.

749
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,705
Is that the consensus?

750
00:54:07,877 --> 00:54:10,277
OK, look, let's cut to it.

751
00:54:10,347 --> 00:54:12,076
I want each of you to tell me
something right now...

752
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:14,241
that gives your life meaning.

753
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,946
Something that excites you,
that turns you on...

754
00:54:20,023 --> 00:54:22,719
that you find value in.
Anything but drugs...

755
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,521
I don't want to hear
any drug stories.

756
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,757
Anybody can jump in.

757
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:36,298
Sara, please help me out.
I'm dying over here.

758
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,765
Freedom.

759
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:46,344
Doing whatever you want and not
giving a fuck what people think.

760
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,816
OK.

761
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:50,512
I play Playstation.

762
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:53,488
Any particular game you like?

763
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,887
I like "Resident Evil 2."

764
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:59,054
Anything where you can use
your imagination, right?

765
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,063
That could give
your life meaning.

766
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:04,032
Just keeping it real,
you know what I'm saying?

767
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:05,226
Looking out for my boys...

768
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,327
and fucking up punks
who get in the way.

769
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:10,896
So, friendship, camaraderie.

770
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,135
Yeah.

771
00:55:13,209 --> 00:55:14,608
Or love.

772
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:17,806
Love? Thank you, Tracey.

773
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:20,281
Boom. OK?

774
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,580
Love. That's very important.

775
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:25,678
- Sex is meaningful.
- You've had sex?

776
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,931
What about you, Lyle?

777
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,263
What gives your life meaning?

778
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:50,941
I don't know.

779
00:56:00,223 --> 00:56:04,751
So, what kind of progress do
you feel you've made since you...

780
00:56:04,828 --> 00:56:06,056
Come on, man, give me a break.

781
00:56:06,129 --> 00:56:07,960
You know I got to ask this.

782
00:56:08,031 --> 00:56:11,330
I've learned how to jerk off
with little or no privacy.

783
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:15,604
So, Sara,
what kind of progress...

784
00:56:15,672 --> 00:56:17,867
do you feel you've made
since you've been here?

785
00:56:17,941 --> 00:56:20,136
Fine progress.

786
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,580
Big Mike.

787
00:56:24,647 --> 00:56:27,138
- My nigga.
- What's going on?

788
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,878
So, what kind of progress
do you think you've made...

789
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,214
since you've been here, buddy?

790
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:32,117
Just bangin', yo.

791
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:38,316
You're going to turn eighteen
in a couple days.

792
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:40,158
That means you're going to be
responsible for yourself...

793
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,061
more or less.

794
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:45,363
- How do you feel about that?
- Great.

795
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:49,301
Is this what you think
being black is, Michael?

796
00:56:49,372 --> 00:56:53,900
Wearing baggy clothes and
talking a lot of shit...

797
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:55,968
fucking up?

798
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,605
Can I get out of here
this week or what?

799
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:03,780
You getting along
with Lyle OK?

800
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:08,555
So, what kind of progress
do you think you've made...

801
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,718
since you've been here, Lyle?

802
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:17,526
Well, I'm recommending
that you go home Friday.

803
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,500
Good.

804
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:23,599
So, what kind of progress
do you think you've made...

805
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:24,731
since you've been here?

806
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:29,478
None whatsoever.

807
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,948
So, what, you think
you're the only one...

808
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,177
who's ever been
fucking depressed?

809
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:38,118
Look, this is freedom.

810
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,587
See these birds?

811
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,146
They're flying away.

812
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:43,454
I mean, look at the color.

813
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:45,687
How can you call it suicidal?

814
00:57:45,762 --> 00:57:48,458
Because he killed himself
right after he painted it.

815
00:57:48,531 --> 00:57:50,226
You have no idea
of the kind of color...

816
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,528
that can come out
of depression.

817
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:53,865
All the great artists
are fucked up.

818
00:57:53,937 --> 00:57:55,632
Boo-fucking-hoo.

819
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,297
Look at the birds.

820
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:59,170
Look at the sky.
Look at the yellows.

821
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,972
This painting, it has borders.

822
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,014
It ends here, here,
here, and here.

823
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:07,549
All paintings are like that.

824
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:10,245
So what?

825
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,721
You're just seeing what
you wanna see, and that's it.

826
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:17,248
That road is going nowhere.

827
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,531
Lyle?

828
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,742
Yeah. What's up?

829
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,816
Does your dad buy you
a lot of things?

830
00:58:44,888 --> 00:58:46,822
My dad's dead.

831
00:58:50,593 --> 00:58:52,220
Do you have a stepdad?

832
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:56,821
Why?

833
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,193
My stepdad's coming tomorrow.

834
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,262
Oh, yeah?

835
00:59:04,574 --> 00:59:06,269
Is he cool?

836
00:59:08,144 --> 00:59:10,908
He buys me stuff sometimes.

837
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,346
I'm getting Playstation 2.

838
00:59:14,918 --> 00:59:17,182
Cool, cool.

839
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:23,991
My dad...

840
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,826
Well, I broke my arm
pretty badly...

841
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:31,298
and I had to go to the hospital
for a few days.

842
00:59:31,367 --> 00:59:34,393
He came and picked me up.

843
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:38,065
And...

844
00:59:38,141 --> 00:59:41,770
he drove me right to the bike
store and got me a bike.

845
00:59:41,844 --> 00:59:43,675
What kind of bike was it?

846
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:46,442
It was a Mongoose BMX.

847
00:59:46,516 --> 00:59:48,984
It was a cool bike.

848
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:53,887
There was this one day I got
on it and just kept going...

849
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:56,425
riding on it
till I got to the beach.

850
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,256
The bike had this squeak
in the chain...

851
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,661
that was really annoying.

852
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,632
I was just listening to
the squeak the whole trip.

853
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,828
When I got to the beach...

854
01:00:06,903 --> 01:00:10,771
I was just cruising along,
like, looking at the ocean.

855
01:00:14,577 --> 01:00:16,568
The squeak...

856
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,274
it kept getting louder.

857
01:00:21,084 --> 01:00:24,247
And I just got off the bike...

858
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,982
and I smashed it
into a street lamp.

859
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,286
Broke the shit out of it.

860
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,744
Kenny.

861
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,942
Have a seat.

862
01:00:59,889 --> 01:01:02,380
As you know,
this meeting today...

863
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:03,982
is so that
your stepdad can see...

864
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,051
what kind of progress
you've been making...

865
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:11,226
and see how close you are
to actually going home.

866
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,895
You do wanna go home,
don't you, pal?

867
01:01:14,971 --> 01:01:17,769
You know, your mother and I
have been thinking.

868
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,400
We'd like to take you
up to Pine Bluff...

869
01:01:20,476 --> 01:01:22,967
maybe do a little waterskiing.

870
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,446
Can I wake board?

871
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:27,881
Absolutely.

872
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:32,412
OK, I'm gonna
leave you two alone.

873
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:35,753
Kenny, I'll be right outside
the door if you need anything.

874
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:38,916
Dave?

875
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,293
Yeah.

876
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,098
What's going on?

877
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,314
You wanna tell me something?

878
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:06,954
Is there something
you wanna say to your stepdad...

879
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,253
while I'm still in the room?

880
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,633
Can I talk to you outside
in the hallway for a moment?

881
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:22,237
I spent a lot of fucking
money on this place.

882
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:23,863
Mr. Jenkins, please.

883
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,703
I think it would be best
if we talk outside.

884
01:02:25,775 --> 01:02:28,573
I would at least like to be able
to talk to my son.

885
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:29,668
I appreciate that...

886
01:02:29,746 --> 01:02:31,611
and I would like for that
to happen as well...

887
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,478
but this may not be
the proper time for...

888
01:02:33,549 --> 01:02:35,346
- What do you people do here?
- Mr. Jenkins...

889
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,750
Look at him. Is this
what you call mental health?

890
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,015
- I've took him out of a bad...
- Mr. Jenkins!

891
01:02:40,089 --> 01:02:42,284
I believe
I've made a mistake...

892
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:45,452
so let's do this
at another time.

893
01:02:45,528 --> 01:02:49,157
Would you please
accompany me to my office?

894
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,894
Fine.

895
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:55,028
It's just not the day for it.

896
01:02:58,641 --> 01:03:00,973
Sorry, Dad.

897
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,584
Mr. Jenkins.

898
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:13,953
Mr. Jenkins!
Mr. Jenkins!

899
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,014
- Mr. Jenkins!
- Let go!

900
01:03:16,092 --> 01:03:17,821
Get off of him! Come here!

901
01:03:17,894 --> 01:03:20,658
Get off me...
get out of here!

902
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:22,721
Go on, get out of here
right now!

903
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:24,994
Get out of here right now.
Get off the premises.

904
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:27,900
Get off the premises right now!

905
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,608
Kenny?

906
01:03:33,676 --> 01:03:36,270
He's gone, OK, Kenny?
He's gone.

907
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,912
Hey.

908
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:53,292
I'm really sorry.

909
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,794
What are you sorry for?

910
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:04,228
Just, like,
about Kenny and all.

911
01:04:06,375 --> 01:04:08,172
Yeah?
Why are you sorry about that?

912
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,007
Are you his dad?

913
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,240
Did you rape him?

914
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:17,141
- I'm just sorry.
- That's a stupid thing to say.

915
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,552
Sorry doesn't mean anything.

916
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,112
You think sorry
means anything at all?

917
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,987
You think it does anything?

918
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:25,960
Are you that fucking stupid,
you think sorry does anything?

919
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:27,120
No.

920
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,823
Maybe if you got
some fucking sleep at night...

921
01:04:28,898 --> 01:04:30,593
instead of screaming...

922
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,634
you'd realize that everything
is just fucked...

923
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,001
and sorry doesn't mean anything!
Sorry doesn't mean shit!

924
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:39,405
It doesn't mean fucking shit!
What do you think about that?

925
01:04:39,475 --> 01:04:41,773
Answer me! I said,
what do you think about that?

926
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:46,281
I said what the fuck do you
think about that? Answer me!

927
01:06:35,358 --> 01:06:39,522
Well, you all know
what happened with Kenny.

928
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:42,087
You probably have
some strong opinions...

929
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,359
emotions about it, so...

930
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:47,262
as always, this is
the place to air them.

931
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,894
How the hell are we supposed
to trust you guys...

932
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:50,768
when shit like this happens?

933
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,306
That's a valid question.

934
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,279
All I can say
is that sometimes...

935
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,372
things happen
that are beyond our control.

936
01:07:00,449 --> 01:07:01,939
So, where is he?

937
01:07:02,018 --> 01:07:03,781
He's in another wing
of the hospital.

938
01:07:03,853 --> 01:07:06,048
He's being taken care of.

939
01:07:06,122 --> 01:07:08,113
You didn't have
to let his dad in.

940
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:16,958
Well, it obviously went about
as badly as it could've gone.

941
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,967
No shit.

942
01:07:19,035 --> 01:07:22,004
Just shut up, Lyle.
It's not his fault.

943
01:07:22,071 --> 01:07:26,064
It's OK. Lyle can be upset.
It's all right.

944
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:29,871
Kenny's a sweet guy. It hurts.

945
01:07:29,945 --> 01:07:32,311
He never hurt anybody.

946
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:35,043
Nigga, please. He used to fuck
around with little kids, yo.

947
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:38,086
That's just payback,
you know what I'm saying?

948
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,152
No, Lyle, no! Wait a minute!

949
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,284
No! Stop! No! Mike! Mike!

950
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,819
- Let go. I got him.
- No, no. Sit down. Sit down!

951
01:07:48,898 --> 01:07:51,264
Sit down right now, Lyle!

952
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:57,128
OK. Do you feel better now?
Did you fix Kenny now?

953
01:07:57,206 --> 01:07:58,537
Is Kenny all better now?

954
01:07:58,607 --> 01:08:01,906
How about you,
you all better now?

955
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,467
Do you think you're the only
one who gets pissed off...

956
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:06,208
and wants to fucking rage?
I can break shit.

957
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:09,274
I can scream
like a motherfucker!

958
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:12,013
All day long!

959
01:08:12,088 --> 01:08:13,578
Now what?

960
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,180
Kenny's still fucked up,
and I'm still miserable.

961
01:08:15,257 --> 01:08:16,349
I guess I gotta
break some more shit.

962
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:20,225
Get up, Lyle.
Get up right now, Lyle. Get up!

963
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:26,466
OK?

964
01:08:26,535 --> 01:08:28,935
Didn't work.
I'm still pissed off.

965
01:08:29,004 --> 01:08:31,302
Maybe I need to fuck
something else up now, huh?

966
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,034
Maybe I need to punch somebody
in the fucking face!

967
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:34,736
Is that the solution?

968
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,705
No, that ain't
the solution, man.

969
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:41,375
So what do I do?

970
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:43,350
I just get on
with my fucking life...

971
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:46,650
and I try to make
something of it.

972
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,849
Why are you here, man?

973
01:08:48,924 --> 01:08:50,619
Why are you alive?

974
01:08:50,693 --> 01:08:54,060
Do you want to be alive?

975
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:56,394
Life is a struggle, Lyle.
That's it.

976
01:08:56,465 --> 01:08:59,957
It's a struggle.
That's the way it fucking is.

977
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,265
Can you handle that?

978
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:06,272
Can you handle that, Lyle?

979
01:09:09,378 --> 01:09:10,845
I'm gonna be in my office.

980
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:13,279
You guys sit here
and figure out why you're here.

981
01:09:58,661 --> 01:10:00,151
Who wants some?

982
01:10:02,498 --> 01:10:04,261
There's one player.

983
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:08,333
Aw, yeah.

984
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,308
That's a good block.

985
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,010
Oh, good pass!

986
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:25,611
Good pass.

987
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,883
It don't get
no sweeter than that.

988
01:10:27,957 --> 01:10:29,788
Yeah, Mike.

989
01:10:33,028 --> 01:10:35,155
It was on the way down.

990
01:10:35,231 --> 01:10:37,893
All right, first of ten,
by one. Peace.

991
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,026
Since y'all like to bang bodies.

992
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:41,467
No fouls.

993
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,605
Time, time, time...

994
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:50,804
Go ahead, man.
Work it out.

995
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,748
Yo, Braveheart, can we play?

996
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,116
Play. Play the game.

997
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:02,813
Shit. What? Man. Good job.

998
01:11:02,891 --> 01:11:04,825
Yeah!

999
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:10,224
I got Lyle, you got Chad.
Let's do this.

1000
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,800
That's not legal.

1001
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,130
What the fuck's
wrong with you, man?

1002
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,364
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

1003
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:29,006
Give me some!

1004
01:11:32,154 --> 01:11:34,952
Great game, tough guy.

1005
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:35,956
Sorry about that.

1006
01:11:36,025 --> 01:11:37,014
It's all right.

1007
01:11:40,162 --> 01:11:43,290
It was a good day
today, huh? Fun?

1008
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,291
I had fun.

1009
01:11:49,271 --> 01:11:51,535
Sorry I freaked out on you, man.
That wasn't cool.

1010
01:11:51,607 --> 01:11:53,507
It's fine.

1011
01:11:53,575 --> 01:11:57,204
So, you still think you're ready
to walk out of here at any time?

1012
01:11:58,314 --> 01:11:59,542
Yeah.

1013
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:03,278
Well, what was that
in group today?

1014
01:12:03,352 --> 01:12:06,515
You're so full of shit.
You wanted to hit him, too.

1015
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:09,614
That's totally
irrelevant, Lyle.

1016
01:12:09,692 --> 01:12:13,651
Everybody wanted to smack him
upside the head, but you did it.

1017
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:14,787
He deserved it.

1018
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:19,425
No. Fuck that, man. Come on.

1019
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:23,938
The way your dad treated you,
did you deserve that?

1020
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,098
That was different.

1021
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:28,371
'Cause the people
that you beat deserve it?

1022
01:12:30,979 --> 01:12:32,037
Lyle, what about you?

1023
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:33,274
You burn yourself
with cigarettes.

1024
01:12:33,349 --> 01:12:34,839
You cut yourself.

1025
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,078
You slam your head into walls.

1026
01:12:37,152 --> 01:12:40,883
We both know
you don't deserve that, man.

1027
01:12:40,956 --> 01:12:44,016
Lyle, wherever you're going,
you are still gonna be there.

1028
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:45,788
Then what?

1029
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,055
What am I supposed to do?

1030
01:12:47,129 --> 01:12:48,255
Come sit down.

1031
01:12:48,330 --> 01:12:49,854
No.

1032
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:53,197
Lyle, I'm not gonna give you
some hokey bullshit speech...

1033
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:56,431
and tell you that if you come to
some epiphany about your dad...

1034
01:12:56,505 --> 01:12:57,699
you're gonna make
a breakthrough...

1035
01:12:57,773 --> 01:13:00,071
and everything's gonna be
pizzas and blow jobs.

1036
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,734
Because the fact
of the matter is...

1037
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,402
it's quite possible that
you're gonna have this rage...

1038
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:07,074
within you somewhere
until you die, man.

1039
01:13:07,149 --> 01:13:09,947
Either you're gonna learn
how to live with it...

1040
01:13:10,018 --> 01:13:11,542
or you're just gonna go on
like you've been doing...

1041
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,987
until you kill yourself
or kill somebody else...

1042
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,026
maybe somebody
that you care about.

1043
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,230
It'd be like couples that got,
you know, hooked up...

1044
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:24,788
and they've been together.

1045
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,859
No techs, no nurses or anything
in the whole place...

1046
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:30,097
and so all the kids
are going crazy...

1047
01:13:30,172 --> 01:13:32,834
and all the little couples
are sitting there making out...

1048
01:13:32,908 --> 01:13:34,671
while they have the chance
and everything...

1049
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,267
'cause there's
no one around watching.

1050
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,973
At Vista, they had,
like, little sensors...

1051
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,947
they put in the halls,
so if you opened your door...

1052
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,280
it went, like...

1053
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:44,979
and you couldn't
get out of the room.

1054
01:13:45,053 --> 01:13:46,953
When I was at Vista,
this girl...

1055
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,890
her friends snuck in a lighter,
and, at 2:00 in the morning...

1056
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:54,360
she went by one of the doors,
and she lit the match.

1057
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:58,264
And the fire escape went off,
and the doors unlocked...

1058
01:13:58,333 --> 01:13:59,766
and she got out.

1059
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:04,499
Chad, do you remember
how you were feeling...

1060
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,235
when your uncle admitted you
in the hospital?

1061
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,368
I do.

1062
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:13,279
And I don't wanna see you going
through that same thing again.

1063
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:14,838
Tegretol or Depakote?

1064
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:16,441
Same program. Tegretol.

1065
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:17,712
Just give me pills, right?

1066
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:19,447
And that'll just
take care of everything...

1067
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:21,386
and just solve
all my problems...

1068
01:14:21,457 --> 01:14:23,220
and all the problems
of the world.

1069
01:14:23,292 --> 01:14:24,281
Give everybody pills.

1070
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,350
We can all fucking be
the exact same person.

1071
01:14:26,428 --> 01:14:30,194
This is
a treatable disorder, OK?

1072
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,062
But not if
you don't want it to be.

1073
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,226
Come on.

1074
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,068
It's not up to debate.
You're taking your meds.

1075
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,834
That's it.

1076
01:14:40,676 --> 01:14:42,268
All right.

1077
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,841
Blow them out.
Make a wish, man.

1078
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,519
What about that one?

1079
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:57,581
You gonna blow that one out?

1080
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:02,059
It's still lit.
Go on and try it again.

1081
01:15:07,970 --> 01:15:10,438
- Happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, Chad.

1082
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,565
Happy birthday.

1083
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,165
Here you go, man.

1084
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:15,733
Happy birthday.

1085
01:15:23,218 --> 01:15:24,207
Happy birthday.

1086
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:12,731
Tracey, you gotta
let her go, honey.

1087
01:16:34,957 --> 01:16:37,255
You got my number, right?

1088
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:40,124
- Yeah.
- OK.

1089
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,526
Take care of yourself.

1090
01:16:41,597 --> 01:16:42,529
Bye.

1091
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:43,758
OK.

1092
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:07,716
It's OK, Tracey.

1093
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,452
You'll be OK.

1094
01:17:11,526 --> 01:17:13,221
OK?

1095
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,275
Happy birthday.

1096
01:17:29,344 --> 01:17:31,244
You all right, man?

1097
01:17:34,049 --> 01:17:35,073
Yeah, man.

1098
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,744
Thirteen blackbirds
baked in a pie

1099
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,810
Baked in a pie,
baked in a pie

1100
01:17:39,888 --> 01:17:42,049
So, we're still cool, right?

1101
01:17:42,124 --> 01:17:43,489
You and me?

1102
01:17:43,558 --> 01:17:45,856
What do you mean?
Are you talking about the trip?

1103
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:49,727
'Cause the thing is,
dude, like...

1104
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,358
who gives a fuck
about Amsterdam, you know?

1105
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,493
What are you talking about?

1106
01:17:54,569 --> 01:17:56,662
I mean, do you think
that's gonna change anything?

1107
01:17:56,738 --> 01:18:01,175
Do you really think that's gonna
make things any different?

1108
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,370
I mean, what are you
gonna be doing?

1109
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:05,436
You're gonna be
breathing different air?

1110
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,175
You're gonna be
eating different food?

1111
01:18:07,249 --> 01:18:08,307
Of course there's a difference.

1112
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:11,716
Here you wake up
in a fucking bullshit place.

1113
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:12,845
You can't go anywhere.

1114
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,946
You're trapped here.

1115
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,355
This is fucking hell, man.

1116
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:18,984
So what, then,
you're gonna go over there...

1117
01:18:19,061 --> 01:18:21,222
and then everything
is gonna be cool?

1118
01:18:21,296 --> 01:18:24,424
Even if you are as happy
as you could possibly be...

1119
01:18:24,499 --> 01:18:26,592
pretty soon you gotta
let go of it all...

1120
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,397
because that's just
what happens.

1121
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,402
What?

1122
01:18:29,471 --> 01:18:30,403
Come on.

1123
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:33,032
Why don't you just go, man?

1124
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:35,133
It's a gift, man. Just go.

1125
01:18:36,378 --> 01:18:38,642
Thirteen blackbirds
baked in a pie

1126
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,342
We're going, you and me.
You and me are going.

1127
01:18:49,091 --> 01:18:50,752
So...

1128
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,357
guess what?

1129
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:55,919
I ain't getting released
this week.

1130
01:18:55,997 --> 01:18:57,760
You want to know why?

1131
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:02,268
Because you suck cock.

1132
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:07,365
Think you're pretty
fucking funny, don't you?

1133
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:10,843
You and Chad, you think
you're pretty fucking funny.

1134
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:14,211
I ain't getting released
because of your punk ass.

1135
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:18,446
If we were outside,
I'd just bust a cap in your ass.

1136
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,147
Game.

1137
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,416
But now I'm stuck in here
for another week.

1138
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:26,290
Nigga, I should
kill you right now!

1139
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:30,295
Do it.

1140
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:34,999
Come on.

1141
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:36,628
Just you and me, yo.

1142
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,799
No little faggot friends
to help you, huh?

1143
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,314
Suck that.

1144
01:19:59,027 --> 01:20:00,824
Hey, where you going?

1145
01:20:01,997 --> 01:20:05,763
Come on.
It's just me and me in here.

1146
01:20:16,244 --> 01:20:18,769
That's what I thought. Pussy.

1147
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:54,045
What are you doing?

1148
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:55,377
Reading.

1149
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:56,712
No, this.
What are you doing with this?

1150
01:20:56,785 --> 01:20:58,719
Don't touch me.

1151
01:20:58,787 --> 01:21:02,314
Cut this shit out, man.
You're gonna blow everything.

1152
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:05,752
Blow what?

1153
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,695
I'm gonna be dead in 60 years,
and so are you.

1154
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:12,289
That's stupid, man.

1155
01:21:12,367 --> 01:21:14,562
You're getting
out of here tomorrow.

1156
01:21:16,605 --> 01:21:17,537
You're getting
out of here tomorrow...

1157
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:19,267
and you're gonna
fuck everything up now?

1158
01:21:20,775 --> 01:21:22,208
Leave.

1159
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:25,804
That's fine, but you know that
it doesn't have to be that way.

1160
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:26,973
Guys.

1161
01:21:27,048 --> 01:21:28,777
I'm sorry.

1162
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:31,784
It's your choice.

1163
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:39,783
Fuck you, then.

1164
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:50,131
Chad's all fucked up.
He's cutting on his arm.

1165
01:21:52,841 --> 01:21:54,809
Oh, my God.

1166
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:57,976
Hey, buddy.

1167
01:21:58,046 --> 01:21:59,673
How we feeling today, huh?

1168
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,876
It looks like you're
having a bummer of a day.

1169
01:22:03,952 --> 01:22:07,012
I'd hate for you
to leave us like that, man.

1170
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:08,521
Chad?

1171
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:11,821
Anything I can do for you?

1172
01:22:11,893 --> 01:22:13,656
You can admit that you hate us.

1173
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,659
Maybe you need
a little time alone, Chad.

1174
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:20,496
Good.

1175
01:22:20,568 --> 01:22:22,798
Jesus Christ!

1176
01:22:22,871 --> 01:22:24,964
Get J.C. right now!

1177
01:22:32,747 --> 01:22:35,682
Get the fuck off!

1178
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:38,810
Charlie, Charlie!
Come on, go outside!

1179
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:44,189
Go outside!
Get out of here!

1180
01:22:44,259 --> 01:22:47,422
Go! Charlie, go!
Get out of here!

1181
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:49,190
Get the fuck off me!

1182
01:22:55,570 --> 01:22:56,764
Chad.

1183
01:22:56,838 --> 01:22:59,033
Chad.

1184
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:00,574
You don't wanna do this.

1185
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,633
- Chad.
- Fuck!

1186
01:23:02,711 --> 01:23:04,406
Chad.

1187
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:08,747
How we doing today, Charlie?

1188
01:23:10,752 --> 01:23:12,310
You seem to be having
a down day.

1189
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:14,617
Chad, don't...

1190
01:23:16,291 --> 01:23:17,485
OK.

1191
01:23:17,559 --> 01:23:19,527
Chad, look at me.

1192
01:23:19,594 --> 01:23:21,528
Don't do that, OK?

1193
01:23:23,131 --> 01:23:24,928
What's going on?

1194
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,093
Chad, talk to me.

1195
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,328
What's going on?

1196
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:30,371
Chad, wait a minute.
Chad, Chad.

1197
01:23:32,307 --> 01:23:36,573
Chad... don't.

1198
01:23:41,282 --> 01:23:43,045
Don't!

1199
01:23:43,118 --> 01:23:45,052
Chad!

1200
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:52,722
Oh, God.

1201
01:23:52,794 --> 01:23:55,126
Oh, shit.

1202
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:00,359
Charlie, hold on.

1203
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,027
Oh, shit.

1204
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,532
Tracey, wake up.

1205
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:14,575
It's just me.

1206
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,234
OK, I'm sorry.

1207
01:25:30,391 --> 01:25:31,756
Are you cold?

1208
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:37,756
A little bit.

1209
01:26:05,827 --> 01:26:07,727
Did you see it?

1210
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:13,962
Fucking Chad.

1211
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:10,210
There's ten...
and I'm out.

1212
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:12,048
What you got in your hand?

1213
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:15,214
That's the game.

1214
01:28:16,891 --> 01:28:18,984
Let's go again, man.

1215
01:28:19,060 --> 01:28:21,051
You plan on going home tonight?

1216
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:24,963
You know,
if I get in that car...

1217
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:27,160
I'm not gonna stop
until I run out of gas, man.

1218
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:33,371
He almost cut
his head off, man.

1219
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:35,703
On my watch.

1220
01:28:37,612 --> 01:28:39,671
It was my watch, too.

1221
01:28:39,747 --> 01:28:44,081
Well, we fucked up today.

1222
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,916
That kid wasn't taking
his medication.

1223
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:48,751
Did we know that?

1224
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,522
It wasn't your fault.

1225
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:57,257
You're good at this job, man.

1226
01:29:48,082 --> 01:29:50,243
What's up?

1227
01:29:50,318 --> 01:29:52,809
How you been?

1228
01:29:56,057 --> 01:29:57,081
Wake up.

1229
01:30:02,363 --> 01:30:03,330
I can't stay long.

1230
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:06,765
I just wanted to
stop by and say hey...

1231
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:11,538
see how you're doing.

1232
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:18,803
So I'm gonna take off.

1233
01:30:20,148 --> 01:30:22,275
I'm going to Europe...

1234
01:30:22,350 --> 01:30:24,784
Amsterdam.

1235
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:28,785
It should be
pretty cool, right?

1236
01:30:38,366 --> 01:30:39,355
Ken!

1237
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:43,793
Kenny!

1238
01:30:45,873 --> 01:30:47,738
Dude, I know you can hear me.

1239
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,801
I can tell.
I can tell you can hear me.

1240
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:58,813
All right.

1241
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:02,148
I'm going to count
to three, OK?

1242
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:03,884
And if you don't say
something to me...

1243
01:31:03,958 --> 01:31:06,791
by the time I get to three...

1244
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,988
I'm going to kill you.

1245
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:12,763
One...

1246
01:31:15,736 --> 01:31:17,363
two...

1247
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,438
two and a half...

1248
01:31:35,590 --> 01:31:37,285
I brought you something.

1249
01:31:47,101 --> 01:31:50,798
Come on, dude, I know
you were looking for this.

1250
01:32:09,423 --> 01:32:10,754
I'm sorry.

1251
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:19,324
I'll see you again, OK?

1252
01:33:15,456 --> 01:33:17,515
Hey, have you seen Tracey?

1253
01:33:17,592 --> 01:33:18,524
Naw, dog.

1254
01:33:18,593 --> 01:33:21,460
You rape that
screaming ass bitch yet?

1255
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:24,726
You know she wants some.

1256
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:54,778
I was just looking for you.
