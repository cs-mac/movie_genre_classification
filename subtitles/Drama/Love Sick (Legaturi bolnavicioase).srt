1
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,271
LOVE SICK

2
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,711
I met Alex on the first day
in college.

3
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,316
At first,
it was only a background

4
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,190
with a thousand questions,
requests and stupid.

5
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,316
I was somehow indifferent to it,

6
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,517
and I had no idea,
that was going to happen.

7
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,431
Caution!

8
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,311
Do not forget to tell mom

9
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,472
sent me to summer
clothes next week.

10
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,279
Good.

11
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,078
We will contact you via Mrs. Penes.

12
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,435
It is not Penes, Dad.
This is Mrs. Benes.

13
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,317
I would still catch Christine.

14
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,199
Bucharest crazy city!

15
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,715
What floor?
On 3rd.

16
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,633
Useless. If they were at home,
they would say.

17
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,677
I think I heard something.

18
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:38,157
Interestingly, this building
aseismic.

19
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,438
Even higher I die.

20
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,632
Hello. This is us.
Hello, welcome.

21
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,633
Its my father. He brought me here.
Nice to meet you.

22
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,314
Do not leave them in the hallway.
Take them into the room.

23
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,597
We have two garment bag
and several books and all.

24
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,193
Come on.
And the table.

25
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,074
Come into the room

26
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,352
Straight from the bags.
I'll put them in a corner.

27
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,750
They will not bother you.
It consumes a lot of electricity.

28
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,797
If this is a problem,
Dad can take back.

29
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,838
God forbid! Why it back?
This is a decent house, after all.

30
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,319
Yes, it's very nice.

31
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,550
Can we put these bags
in the room?

32
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,039
Of course. Over there.

33
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,350
My God, what I was thinking!

34
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,596
Where do you want to put the table?

35
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,469
It is needed for the reception?
This is just a small table.

36
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,313
I need for the exams.
Who will suffer?

37
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,596
You will help?
It is better to bring it together.

38
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,070
My daughter is a good girl.
It does not cause any problems.

39
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,912
I've never rented out rooms.

40
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:18,152
But my pills consumed me,
so that wriggle as I can.

41
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,673
That's life.

42
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,072
Alexander, my girl.

43
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,710
Your mother did not want you to
I lived on campus.

44
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,919
Never mind. I'm just happy that I got rid
cockroaches in my dorm.

45
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,589
Lord, Bucharest dirty city!

46
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:42,150
Let's just bring the table,
and then let's go eat.

47
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,437
Look, here's what the doctor
at the clinic gave me.

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,989
Look.
They are absolutely useless.

49
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,628
I did a survey
tests, x-rays, a whole lot.

50
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,438
You can not get them
free at your clinic?

51
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,559
The tests are expensive.
We can go to the table?

52
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,436
Come, my dear.

53
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,830
It is better to carry through the main entrance.
There's more space.

54
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,912
I do not want the neighbors to see you.

55
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,195
But what can you do?

56
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,112
Nothing.

57
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,389
Higher.

58
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:20,790
All is ready?

59
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:21,756
Hey!

60
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,354
I called you.

61
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,511
I'm Kristina,
friend of Alexandra.

62
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,079
You're her father.
Yes.

63
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,798
Let me help you.

64
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,958
Now it is easier?
Oh yeah.

65
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,350
Why does not the elevator?
He does not work.

66
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,593
Similarly, elevator repair.

67
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,239
Higher.

68
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,754
It's you again.

69
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,152
I have to lock the door.
There are so many bullies.

70
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,117
Come in.

71
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,915
It's not as cool as in a dormitory.

72
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,072
I've never lived in a dormitory,
because I'm from Bucharest,

73
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,912
but it was not easy for Alexandra.

74
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,548
We never told you,
but my mother was crying all day,

75
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,709
when we visited you.

76
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,472
She said that you live in the mud.

77
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,677
Kiki, you do not ask Ms. Benes,
to make room for me?

78
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,354
You have not agreed to?

79
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,869
Aunt Lucretia!

80
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,793
At least it's a decent house.

81
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,949
You need a whole wardrobe?

82
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,758
It is enough for clothes.
Oh, what a mess!

83
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,388
Aunt Lucretia,
Could you do a wardrobe?

84
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,596
Okay, honey.
I will take things.

85
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,036
And still it is necessary to release the shelf for books.

86
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,120
We will carry out old documents
to another room.

87
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,272
Women's magazine
Flacara for 1966.

88
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,795
Just lure for any insects!

89
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,394
You're lucky, Christina
recommended for you.

90
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,835
If not for her, I would not
take the room.

91
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,471
You are going home today?

92
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,791
Yes, but I do not want to go at night.

93
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,872
My brother, as usual.

94
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,869
Well, Alexander, if you do not want,
so I took some things,

95
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,759
I have to go.
I'd like to see your village.

96
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,797
Although I am not a family member.

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,315
Please anytime.
Kiki!

98
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,833
Who's there?

99
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,113
Kiki! You are welcome!

100
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,953
Tell him to quit.
I do not even know it.

101
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,680
Why did not you tell him?

102
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,040
Kiki, go out, please!

103
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,428
Let's bury the hatchet!

104
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,433
Sandhu, give it to me!
Come to me, and I will kill you!

105
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,113
What is this noise?

106
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,874
Sandu. We bickering with him.

107
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:51,034
Look a layer of dust.

108
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,033
Wait a minute. I think we
We have to decide in the first place ...

109
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,872
I asked Christine to tell a girl

110
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,793
I want to pay
for the six months ahead.

111
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:01,349
By October.
Like this?

112
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,193
May June July August,
September October.

113
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,874
In November.
November, right.

114
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,239
I was so angry with him.
I'm glad you came.

115
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,959
How about I finish here
and then we'll go have a drink?

116
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,075
No, I'll go to your father.

117
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,629
I said I wanted to go
to your parents.

118
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,199
What for?
We will go there in the summer.

119
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,113
Okay. We'll talk tomorrow.

120
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,795
You want me to I went with you?
I will not come at the first workshop.

121
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,637
We paid for the six months ahead,
so do not worry about it.

122
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,313
You did not help me
expand the book?

123
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,516
I'll get a scolding from her mother,
if you arrive late.

124
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,194
Well, I can not do it alone.

125
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,791
You'll be fine here.

126
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,079
Heavy student life.

127
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,310
But good, too!

128
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,597
This is French. Dubois.

129
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,918
Say, that girl ...
Is it not strange?

130
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,629
I do not know.
I do not think so.

131
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,595
It was the first night when
I slept at Alex with her. 

132
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,876
I fell asleep drunk
from drinking beer, 

133
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,712
and I dreamed that we were both
running in the rain, 

134
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,348
as it were a race. 

135
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:28,592
In the morning I woke up
and I looked at her. 

136
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,318
She slept peacefully. 

137
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
I smelled,
the smell of her sleep, 

138
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,079
and I wanted
to see her every morning. 

139
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,794
I'm leaving,
so I do not spoil your plans.

140
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,870
Stop.

141
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,190
I'm talking about your boyfriend Alex.
Alexandra is a girl!

142
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,998
Oh yes?
Well, then I'll wait and see.

143
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,479
Perfectly!

144
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,470
Are you happy?

145
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,551
I understand,
Why are you doing this.

146
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,870
As my mother said, it will take time,
to heal those wounds.

147
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,075
And what says the Pope?

148
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,391
You can sneer all you like,
but it will not change my feelings for you.

149
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,390
My feelings
We have changed.

150
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,959
If you want, let's start from the beginning.

151
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,476
I want you to leave me alone
and ceased to complicate my life.

152
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,756
I'm sorry, but it is not so simple?

153
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,593
I said,
we no longer see,

154
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,829
so be it.

155
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,468
Here is how? Why
we do not see?

156
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,598
Because I
sick of you.

157
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,673
I'm worried about how to
exam. And all red.

158
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,749
Do not touch my shirt.

159
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,950
This friendship is very important to me.

160
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:37,556
Alex - that's all that I
Now you need.

161
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,599
I like her.
She's really special.

162
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,318
I'm not interested.

163
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,994
You do not care what I want?

164
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,152
Do not call me more.
I want it all to stop.

165
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,710
And if you love me,
You will do as I ask.

166
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,397
Do you want this?
Yes.

167
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,869
Promise me that
perform my request.

168
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,076
If this is what you want,
I just disappear.

169
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,912
I asked you to stop all this.

170
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,672
I understood you.

171
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,070
The question is, are you ready
to the consequences?

172
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,390
Hey.
Hey.

173
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,470
I hope I'm not late.

174
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,995
This is Alex.
Alexandra.

175
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,878
And this is my brother, Sandu.

176
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,871
Did you call me?
It was hard to hear.

177
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,395
I was on Kogalniceanu Square.
I took a taxi.

178
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,358
What are you drinking?
I will drink tea.

179
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,636
We drank some poison.

180
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,792
To what?
No, stay. I'm going.

181
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,678
So what do you want tea.
And you, Kiki?

182
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,400
You said that you go to work?

183
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,790
Your brother is also named
Alexander?

184
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,598
Why is too?
Your name is Alexander.

185
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,274
Did you quarrel?
No.

186
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,795
You look upset.

187
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,997
no need to complicate things.
We have no quarrel. We buried the hatchets.

188
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,994
Good. Here's what I bought you.
I hope, you like it.

189
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,559
I think they are beautiful.

190
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,872
I saw this and thought, earrings
about you. And I bought myself a ring.

191
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,078
What ring?

192
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,310
They are worn in the nose Indians
from Papua New Guinea.

193
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,311
This is my glass.
Too late.

194
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,711
So what? When I see you again?
on Sunday.

195
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,232
When?

196
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,230
Sandu.

197
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,996
You're cruel. Can I call
your birthday?

198
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,229
So far, Sanda.

199
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,233
That's how it should be worn.
That's cool.

200
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,435
Let's see fit
Does it to you.

201
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,989
That's great, but it does not go
the fact that I wear.

202
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:40,359
You do not like the earrings?
They do not fit in my clothes.

203
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:43,512
I do not want to go home.
Where shall we go?

204
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,148
To the cinema?

205
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,630
Let's take the cake.
Would you?

206
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,473
Are you still upset?
Why?

207
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,473
You look sad.
No. I'm happy that you came.

208
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,995
And I feel that I want
something sweet.

209
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,075
Wow, this old lady!
what happened?

210
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,912
I wanted to boil water for tea,

211
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,435
and she began to show me
how to turn off the faucet.

212
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,669
What I should not delay
it too much

213
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,239
otherwise I can rip it
and then flooded the bottom neighbors

214
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,469
and they are your friends.

215
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,868
I do not care who I flooded.

216
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,235
I have to boil the water.

217
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,550
I do not want to go home today.

218
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,597
You do not mind,
today if I stay with you?

219
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,036
Of course.
One moment, I'll make tea.

220
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,998
No, forget about the tea.
Stay here.

221
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,436
Then I just turn off the stove,
otherwise I will kill Benes.

222
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,316
Oh, you still made the tea.

223
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,232
Yes.
Careful, it's hot!

224
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,109
You're so thoughtful!
You'll make a good wife.

225
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,788
You have fun here!

226
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,470
How nice!

227
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,876
Let's just close
home for a week.

228
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,031
I did that.

229
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,315
When I lived with parents

230
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,436
summer, I spend days
I read in the garden.

231
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,874
Do not you bored?

232
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,917
Do not you want to go
the club with the guys?

233
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,798
No.

234
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,394
Where are your earrings?
You do not want to wear them?

235
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,118
Look in my bag.

236
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,192
In fact, I prefer the ring.

237
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,635
Take him.

238
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,438
Will you wear earrings.

239
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,068
They will approach you.
Your face is rounder.

240
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,958
My ears are not pierced.

241
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:59,430
What do you mean?
All the girls pierced ears.

242
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,149
And you did not wear earrings?

243
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,474
Never worn!
You're not allowed to?

244
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,155
No, my mother did not want to do
it hurts me when I was little.

245
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,709
And you want to look good
without earrings?

246
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,348
You know, I can
pierce your ears.

247
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,238
I do not want to pierce your ears!

248
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,356
As you want.

249
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,317
It can not hurt.

250
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,549
Calcined needle lighter,

251
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,280
Immerse yourself in the spirit, and
I quickly made a hole.

252
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,714
You do not even feel it!

253
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,110
No I do not want.
They did not fit.

254
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,840
I have a round face,
and I'll be like a monkey.

255
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,718
I'd rather admire them
on you.

256
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,440
And you really know how to do it?
what?

257
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,637
To pierce ears?
You've done this before?

258
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,268
Go find the needle!

259
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,475
Come on.

260
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,875
Well, if I do not die from this ...

261
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,837
Leave thread.

262
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,558
I did not find alcohol.

263
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,870
Why and thread?
You'll find out.

264
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,155
Lie down.

265
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,109
Wait, I do not see.

266
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,918
It does not hurt.

267
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,150
Do you have wool here?

268
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,279
Done.

269
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,351
Wait a bit!
Firmly hold. Come on.

270
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,191
No more.

271
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,793
Do you want to there was only one hole?

272
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,871
I do not want more earrings.
Look at me.

273
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,350
Everything will be fine. Tomorrow you will come
college these assholes get.

274
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,157
Come on!

275
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:10,756
I do not want them to
fell.

276
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,709
What is this noise?

277
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,314
Mother of God!
What are you doing over there?

278
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,959
Alex pierces ears.

279
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,917
Go to your room.
All is well.

280
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,911
Christine, my dear,
ears pierced now?

281
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,071
You could not wait until tomorrow?

282
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,719
Take your shit out of my ears.

283
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,438
Hold on tight!
Do you have any alcohol?

284
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,953
You many want?

285
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,509
Just moisten a bit
cotton wool.

286
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,238
God, why did I agree?

287
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,076
You were very brave.
I did not think I was so brave.

288
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,198
It should be wet with alcohol.
Otherwise it may fester.

289
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,318
Thank you, Aunt.
You were very nice.

290
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,031
Now I'll put Alexander to bed.
See you tomorrow morning.

291
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,792
Attach it.

292
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,117
that still hurts?
It was not even hurt.

293
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,953
Oh, how are you.
That you are now so brave.

294
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,759
You should see your face.

295
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,790
Are you sleepy?

296
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,596
Come on, put your head on my knees.

297
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,153
Hello.

298
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,708
I have not done.
What time is it now?

299
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,429
10:20
We still have half an hour.

300
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,194
I think we will go
in the movie 1 1:00.

301
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,033
You said today
we go to a lecture Mihailescu.

302
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,235
Come next week.

303
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,231
Next week
you say the same thing.

304
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,631
I want some more work here.

305
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,793
What it is?

306
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,236
Lecture on folklore.
We have to write a report for the workshop.

307
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,595
But it's not your handwriting?

308
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,275
I took it from the fat woman,
which is terribly painted.

309
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,591
What?

310
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:52,435
You smell nice.
What kind of perfume?

311
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,673
I do not know what kind of perfume.
I gave them to my mother.

312
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:59,798
And I use Love me.

313
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,188
Smell the smell?

314
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,591
I thought it was your natural smell.

315
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,310
Let's take the book home.
I will help you in the evening to write.

316
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:24,598
And you can ask
pick up this book?

317
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,513
Mom needs this Alexandra
book tomorrow.

318
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,593
Well, I'll write.
But tomorrow bring.

319
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,552
I talked to Sandu.
Sends you greetings.

320
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,269
He will come for lunch on Sunday.
Good.

321
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,829
Bye.
Good luck. Good luck!

322
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,829
You lose that?
Nothing.

323
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,117
I do not really want to.
You want to go to a lecture?

324
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,191
Why are you doing it?
Come with me.

325
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,749
Did not We decided to go to the movies?
Let's not quarrel.

326
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,672
Now you make me
do what you want,

327
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,590
and it is right?

328
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,830
Why did not you tell me,
you do not want to go?

329
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,514
I will not go. I arrived in Bucharest
to go to university.

330
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,318
Look at you!

331
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,869
I am guilty because I want to,
that we were together?

332
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,998
I am guilty, because let me
depend on you.

333
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:27,754
Why are you angry?

334
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,751
Do you want us to
Mihailescu went to a lecture?

335
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,478
No, I'll go to the movies.

336
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,599
No, we will go to a lecture
and write down all that he says.

337
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,910
We can go to the movies
at 2:00 hours.

338
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,439
From this control and the next two
hours diligent note-taking

339
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,874
I wanted to climb the walls.

340
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,875
From anger, I am ready
I was screaming.

341
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,034
I could not understand how so
It happened that I fell in love with her.

342
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,639
Look, Alexander.

343
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,190
If this man card
Management appear here,

344
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,669
please tell him that you
my niece.

345
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,239
I do not want us to have a problem.

346
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,029
What management department?
Say you are my niece.

347
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:42,035
You're as niece to me,
Christina.

348
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,395
I just know
you less than her.

349
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,028
It may appear
Anytime.

350
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,351
Just as 30 years ago,
when I was here with my Nick,

351
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,238
who had just returned
from a business trip,

352
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,595
and the guy card
just knocked on the door.

353
00:24:54,760 --> 00:25:02,633
He wanted to check our documents.
And he recorded us as lovers!

354
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,791
He wrote us a penalty,

355
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,633
and we were forced to cancel
That year our trip to the resort.

356
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,351
A year later,
Nick returned to his wife

357
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,909
and left me alone to pay
these penalties.

358
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,878
That is why I warn you.

359
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:23,068
Oh, you are so elegant. yours
parents can be proud of you.

360
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,276
You're not like the vulgar
girls I see on the street,

361
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,876
they wear these pants,
showing her navel.

362
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,634
Mrs. Parvulescu
He invited me to dinner.

363
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,677
Well, it means we have agreed.

364
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,515
You say that you are my niece,
just came to visit.

365
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,274
Yes, Aunt Lucretia, do not worry.
I will not let you down.

366
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,749
Bye, honey.

367
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,878
Hello!

368
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,554
I'll take it to the kitchen.

369
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,994
They are almost ready.
Come to my room.

370
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:27,708
what?
you have to change your shirt.

371
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,788
Strange bathroom.

372
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,272
What is that?
I want to open a haberdashery.

373
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,158
No, really!

374
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,517
When I was little, I had
girlfriend, I really liked.

375
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,399
We loved to climb under the desk,
marshaled armies of buttons

376
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,709
and fought with each other.

377
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,713
One day she took a manicure
scissors, lifted his shirt,

378
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,359
and I wanted to cut off my nipples.

379
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,509
Why?

380
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,831
I do not know. She said she wanted
give them to me.

381
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,437
However, her nipples
It looked like two small hearts.

382
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,353
Why do you have two beds?

383
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,991
One was Sandu.
I was afraid to sleep alone.

384
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,948
Christina! Lunch is ready!

385
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,431
Hello.

386
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,876
Hello! I'm so glad you came,
Alexandra.

387
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,995
Sit down.

388
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,593
Take it, please.

389
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,797
Oh, no! This place Sandu.
You sit next to Christina.

390
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,758
My father would sit at the end of
table, and I'll sit next to the door.

391
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,353
I have not done everything.

392
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,433
So how do you like in Bucharest?
It is already a year ago came.

393
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,115
I lived in a dormitory.
And why did you move?

394
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,759
I did not like it.

395
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:52,469
Girls, you would have seen,
situation in the '70s,

396
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,119
when we went to college.

397
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:57,750
If we could get a bed
and a table to cut sausage,

398
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,955
we were delighted.

399
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,473
Now other times.

400
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,598
Christina, what is this fat sack
on the sink?

401
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,550
That I brought. There's eggs and a little
larded meat from my parents.

402
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,199
They do it very well.

403
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,191
Oh, dear, you should not do.

404
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:16,399
They sent it to you, not
for us. Please take it back.

405
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,677
In addition, we do not eat fatty foods.

406
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,400
Kristina, bring it back,
Alexander did not forget to pick up.

407
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,471
Your parents do
agriculture?

408
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:27,791
No, my father is a veterinarian,
and my mother a teacher.

409
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,359
Christina, please.

410
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,956
But they keep chickens, and last year,
Dad decided to have pigs.

411
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,432
Then I might have met your mother
when he led inspection of the schools.

412
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,989
We then spent a great job.
I know the area by heart.

413
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,115
Where are you from?

414
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,431
PetroSiti.
Well, so far I have not been.

415
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,353
It Sandu.

416
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:48,916
Hello!

417
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:54,313
Sandhu, my boy, put
slippers, for God's sake?

418
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,792
what are you watching?
And you can not keep silent.

419
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,509
What are you doing?

420
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,148
Sandhu, do not take food hands
in front of a guest!

421
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,470
Relax, mom
OK, eat.

422
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,871
I'll leave at 5:00 o'clock.

423
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,680
It's poisonous swill
we drank the last time?

424
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,353
Why do you call it
This poisonous swill?

425
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,875
You did it like that.
Sam then drank half a bottle.

426
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,871
No, he is not an alcoholic.
He drinks in moderation.

427
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,235
He's not an alcoholic.
He just drank without measure.

428
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,630
Leave the boy alone.

429
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,037
Toast!

430
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,634
During the visit of Alexandra
Bucharest.

431
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,078
Yes, Miss Alexander.

432
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,388
And for my new passport.
what is it?

433
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,632
And you thought I was going
abroad under the bus pass?

434
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:53,950
You can not help but dig
hands in a bowl?

435
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,758
Just put the food itself to the plate.

436
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,115
I do not want to eat after you.
I do not want to be infected with herpes.

437
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,271
What we are sensitive!

438
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,228
Interestingly, and where are you going
go with your passport?

439
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,719
In Pitesti.

440
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,632
Do not be rude to his father!

441
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,791
I do not want to talk...
but I had already guessed.

442
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,916
You're acting like a little boy.

443
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,150
Salad of eggplant is very tasty.
How did you do?

444
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,799
I'm glad you liked it.

445
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,589
I added a little onion and
mayonnaise, for a more delicate taste.

446
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,478
Delicious!

447
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,238
This blouse.
This was Christine.

448
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,037
Correctly?

449
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,955
I bought for her.
This is Christina.

450
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,477
I borrowed it. It suits her,
is not it? She's beautiful.

451
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,758
On you it looks better than
my sister. You can have it.

452
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,831
She went without a bra.

453
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,878
Why are you kicking me, Mom?

454
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,076
How strong!

455
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,549
This is because you are not used to
to such.

456
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,518
Of course!
Yes, it is already used to everything.

457
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,671
Do not exaggerate!

458
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:14,231
Although,
Here is proof of courage.

459
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,073
Christine, did you do it?
Yes.

460
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,800
It is better to consult a doctor.
It infected.

461
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,748
She did not need a doctor.
A week later, they are completely healed.

462
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,469
This must be one of those
trinkets that you wear in your ears.

463
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,915
Girls go through hell
for the sake of beauty.

464
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,152
We need to spread antiseptic.

465
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:40,952
A weakly You get pierced?
what do you mean?

466
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,189
Your phone is ringing!

467
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,718
Stop arguing with each other.

468
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,472
You behave as if you do not
brother and sister.

469
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,629
This Coca-Cola?

470
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,994
No, do not open it.

471
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,752
I will take it,
drink later with Alex.

472
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,477
As you wish.

473
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,110
Christine, tell me the dish,
you are welcome.

474
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,876
I forgot to tell you, I was talking to
Mrs. Negulesko recently.

475
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,439
She arranged for me

476
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,910
visit to her cousin
in Switzerland for two months.

477
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:12,750
You want to leave?

478
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,390
Yes, I'm leaving, as
I realized I could not do the piercing.

479
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,430
And you go with the old woman?

480
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,034
Christina, please
Mrs. Negulesko not old.

481
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,350
It looks good,
Lord have mercy.

482
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,034
What luck, it will be
wonder boy in her company.

483
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,192
What other services
you will perform?

484
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,428
Stop grinning.
You know, I hate it.

485
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,431
Stop grinning idiot!

486
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,239
What are you accept, say,
nonsense in front of everybody?

487
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,755
Shame on you,
say nasty things to her sister.

488
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,831
Do not honk me that it is time to
stay. I know what I am saying.

489
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,028
What are the signals?
Just calm down and sit down.

490
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,429
If you ate, I'll take
plates and bring the soup.

491
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,597
Christina, you do not want
sleep tonight at home?

492
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,873
No, I do not want to bother.
What if Ms. Negulesko come?

493
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,508
You're going to sleep at home.

494
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:13,034
Have We not your family?
No, I'll sleep in Alexandra.

495
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,076
You get up and leave right now.

496
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,355
I'm already ...

497
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,557
Get up and go away, you bastard.
This concerns you.

498
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,875
Alexander, you help me?
Christina, you too.

499
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,954
We wanted more
time to spend together. 

500
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,998
We loved to wander
around these buildings 

501
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,958
with peeling plaster
and old balconies, 

502
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,951
sagging with age. 

503
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,315
I have not told her
I love her. 

504
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,917
In fact, I do not know yet
what I feel. 

505
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,792
We went to the movies
and we spent the whole day there. 

506
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,190
We did not go out into the street.
And turns sleeping. 

507
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,158
I only remember the smell of her skin. 

508
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,348
When we are bored city
we just went to the mountains. 

509
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,512
We rent a room with faded sheets 

510
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,398
and looked out the window at the passers-by. 

511
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,672
I liked to listen to her, lying on
stomach, his head in his hands, 

512
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,353
watch it 

513
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:39,470
perfectly manicured fingers,
with neatly trimmed nails. 

514
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,189
We did not think that parted and
We did not think about the bad, 

515
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,272
since then we have lived with ease. 

516
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,032
We were like carefree children 

517
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,111
and just had fun, 

518
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:52,236
We lived to the fullest. 

519
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,037
Where are you going?
Take a shower.

520
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,591
Good. And how long?
You want to go first?

521
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,194
I have a meeting at 11 o'clock.

522
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,750
I saw a cool swimsuit,
Sandu has to buy it for me.

523
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,753
You go away for a long time?

524
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,351
Why you do not want
go to the sea?

525
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,988
My parents will kill me,
if I do not go home.

526
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,752
You want to go in that hole!

527
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,354
It's not quite a hole. It is beautiful there.

528
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,796
There is a large courtyard garden behind the house
and the forest on the mountain,

529
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,030
even the river, where you can swim.

530
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,952
A milk-honey river there?

531
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,633
Do not laugh at me!

532
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,273
You are angry at me?

533
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:54,035
If you loved me,
you would not say that.

534
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,953
what?
Nevermind.

535
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,350
Do you want your parents
I guessed that we're together?

536
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,635
They did not guess.

537
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,994
And what we will have a vacation?

538
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,832
Hiding from parents
for the trees?

539
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,195
Hide in the corners?
Why hide?

540
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,590
You want to see your mother,
I shove my tongue in your mouth?

541
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,159
Why do you say that?

542
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,311
No, really,
What is a vacation?

543
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,358
If kissing in front of my parents
make you happy,

544
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,748
we could do it.

545
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,153
I need to pee.
Close the door.

546
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,753
Hi, this is Sandu.
Leave your message.

547
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,038
Today, June 10, I called
say, Happy Birthday.

548
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,476
Although you no longer love me,
I still love you,

549
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,949
and I want you to call me too
on my birthday.

550
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:55,513
But love is not that
remember someone's birthday.

551
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,912
I love that I can not live without you.

552
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:05,154
Why are you torturing me?
Why are you afraid?

553
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:12,556
You want to kill me, do you want,
that I bled for you?

554
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,871
You're just a beast.

555
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,715
And I have nothing for you!

556
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,758
I am your shadow!

557
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,073
Although not the first my congratulations,

558
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,915
you know perfectly well,
that it has value only.

559
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,638
Happy Birthday, my dear!

560
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:48,076
I wish you happiness!
Till. I love you.

561
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,037
Till!

562
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,080
You can go.

563
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,198
If you hurry,
we have time to time.

564
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:04,319
You said that you have a meeting
with your brother?

565
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,311
We can not go together?

566
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,835
I thought, what do you want
one go.

567
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,877
You want me to go with you?

568
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,918
Do not I mean it?

569
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:17,152
I'll buy it
and you, too, something good.

570
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,435
I dont know!

571
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,875
Whenever I see your brother,
I want to escape.

572
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,316
I promise that we will not last long.

573
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,993
Surprisingly, as yet
later you can not come?

574
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,469
I'm not too late.
We were late because of me.

575
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:39,598
You do with it.
As if you do not know it. Let's go to.

576
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,909
Did you get my message?

577
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,798
I thought we agreed ...

578
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,476
You changed my mind.
I do not know what to say.

579
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,791
I can not wait for you
until you svistnesh.

580
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,554
I can not bear it!
Let's talk later.

581
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,678
As you want.
This.

582
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,795
Want to see how
it will be on me?

583
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,155
Go. I'll wait.

584
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,678
what are you doing? Bored?
I do not like shopping.

585
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,353
And she loves.

586
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,273
I once waited for her for over an hour,
yet she chose shoes.

587
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,590
She has strange tastes.

588
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,070
I like.
She's special.

589
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,718
Yes, it is true.

590
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,232
Christina? Christina!

591
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,116
What?

592
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,840
Are you ready?
Give me a sec!

593
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,797
So how is it? What do you think?

594
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,871
Great!
I'll get it to you.

595
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,191
Seriously, it suits you.

596
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,069
Come on, tell me how you?
I do not believe him.

597
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,073
I dont know.
These beads on ...

598
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,558
Now so fashionable!

599
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,790
Although you're right.

600
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,518
If a bead come off,
then all the rest followed her.

601
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,591
Just buy it and all.
He is beautiful.

602
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:17,593
Okay, I'll pay.

603
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,749
Straight ahead, on the left
and at the end.

604
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,068
Still far?
No, almost there.

605
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,112
I'll be right back.
Only it is listed.

606
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:30,671
I'm at.
I will wait.

607
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,314
Number 47, reception.

608
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,077
It is on the way.

609
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,429
Already dizzy.
I did not eat anything today.

610
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,388
This Becks, it is normal.
From his head does not hurt.

611
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,599
Let's drink, then sleep.
Tomorrow to get up early.

612
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:32,354
Do you regret that we were going?

613
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,114
silly,
Why should I regret?

614
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:39,034
I've been thinking ...
My house is not so good.

615
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,509
The main thing that
no one will bother us.

616
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,830
You're right.

617
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,753
Why we used to
We did not think about it.

618
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,230
About what?
About everything.

619
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,709
I told you my dream?

620
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,429
I dreamed that we moved
in my dorm room,

621
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,875
and we had a cat.

622
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:03,350
One day someone knocked
and you opened the door.

623
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,431
There was a guy.

624
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,794
Sandu, I guess.

625
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,953
No, not Sandu. What a strange guy.
I do not know how to describe it.

626
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,394
Anyway, he came

627
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,199
and began to demand that we
get rid of the cat.

628
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,511
It should be managed.
Probably.

629
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,876
Go on.

630
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:22,995
What?

631
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,799
What happened next?

632
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,397
Nothing. The cat ran away
between the legs,

633
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,154
but we have been assured,
that he would return.

634
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,709
He was a tramp.

635
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,757
Rolling Stone is usually returned.

636
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,239
Yes.

637
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:43,996
Like us?

638
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,156
Tomorrow I'll pick you up,
when I'm ready.

639
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,036
Here are a few sandwiches
and coffee.

640
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,397
I could not find a thermos.

641
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,357
So many packages!
What is it?

642
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,475
A little bit of cheese...

643
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,790
God knows
what they will feed you there.

644
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,190
No, I have no place. We just
stop somewhere to eat.

645
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,952
And you shall eat all the small stuff!

646
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,599
This is Dad.
Ready?

647
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,670
I took the keys.

648
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,558
Without the key, it will not start.

649
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,518
Did you check the oil, gasoline?
No.

650
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,875
Christina, now the car
on your account.

651
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:06,076
Mom, mobile
it does not work.

652
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,470
I'll call you.
Or call Sandu ...

653
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,473
Dad brought a little low-fat cheese.
Take it.

654
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,550
Mom, I will not take it!

655
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,154
Check gasoline and oil.

656
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:17,709
And do not leave the car
unattended.

657
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:18,596
I understood everything.

658
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,670
Till!

659
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,434
Be careful on the road.

660
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:23,999
Good luck!

661
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:36,076
what are you doing?
Benes asked me to make tea.

662
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,799
what happened to you, Aunt?
I can not get up, Christine. Look.

663
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,589
what's the matter?
My legs do not obey me.

664
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,830
We must go now.
But what exactly does it hurt?

665
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,878
I felt some weakness,
when she got up from the bed.

666
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:57,838
I would have fallen,
if I had not leaned against the wall.

667
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,468
But you fell.
No, I came here to watch TV.

668
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,277
God bless you.

669
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,032
Drink diclofenac.

670
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,236
Does he help me?
Yes.

671
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:06,833
Well, come, my dear.

672
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,356
I talked to my nephew,
he will come to take care of me.

673
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:13,671
You are a long time?
Until the beginning of August.

674
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,673
See you when you get back,
if I do not die at that time.

675
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:19,229
Do not worry, you probably
just ate something not fresh.

676
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:21,960
Maybe mackerel?
Mackerel! Of course!

677
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,271
All right, we're leaving.
And turn off the light in the hallway!

678
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,317
It would be great if she died
and we would be living here alone.

679
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,870
She will not die.
Leave him alone, she shut down.

680
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,194
Two hours later, I knew everything about Alex,
when she was a little girl. 

681
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:56,710
I imagined her, awkward,
shy, dreaming about the future. 

682
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:14,120
This cultural center
and the supermarket together.

683
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:18,990
Like the shopping center,
there is also a night club with a disco.

684
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,030
Turn right.

685
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,474
Here?
Yes.

686
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,796
Hello!

687
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,871
Welcome!

688
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:10,353
This is Christine.
Hello! Welcome!

689
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,671
Hey. Good to see you home, baby.

690
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,116
Nice to meet you.
Welcome.

691
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,794
Petrik, let me help you.

692
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,757
Well, girls, let's go into the house.

693
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:27,358
Petrik, we will be in the house.
You bring luggage.

694
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,878
You ate something?
Yes.

695
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:33,395
Rosie, feed the girls.
They drove for a long time.

696
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:36,120
We already ate.
And I would drink coffee.

697
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,589
Of course.
Thank you.

698
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,149
As the road?

699
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,072
Perfectly.
It took about two hours.

700
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,958
When you went from Bucharest?
Somewhere in the 11 hours.

701
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,348
But we traveled
around Targoviste

702
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,999
because of one-way traffic.

703
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:49,879
And Alex Did not show the way?
I showed I did so.

704
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,431
Well, the road Targovishte
generally a nightmare, bumps, potholes and all.

705
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:57,034
Cold?
Little.

706
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,315
I kindle the fire.

707
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,550
Kiki will sleep in my room ...
Christina.

708
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:03,909
We have prepared the guest room.
Nothing Petrik.

709
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:05,672
They will be so comfortable.

710
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:08,115
All is well. Cabbage will be ready
after half an hour.

711
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,669
Go until unpack things.
And come back.

712
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:13,552
Voila!

713
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,992
I want to sleep.

714
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,479
Let's go to drink coffee.

715
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:23,394
Forget the coffee.
I sleep better.

716
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,630
What about my room?

717
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:29,952
Fine, how are you.

718
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,636
Can?

719
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,759
Dad, there was light.

720
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,915
I'll bring you our.
Where is my?

721
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,991
Your mother took when control
I checked out of school.

722
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:47,712
You can bring it to me?
Of course. Now.

723
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:55,592
Your parents are so funny,
like taking Prozac.

724
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:03,996
Let's hear the tale.
Let's see what you have here.

725
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:10,838
Little Fairy,
Grain of rice ...

726
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,272
This one.

727
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,396
The player works?
I forgot to ask.

728
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,075
Naturally. In this house
everything works like clockwork.

729
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,599
Once upon a time lived
the Emperor and Empress.

730
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,590
LOCAL FIRE STATION

731
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,153
Both were young and beautiful.

732
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:46,038
But one thing was sad,

733
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,316
they could not have children.

734
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:51,315
After a long search,
they found the wise wizard,

735
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,710
who gave the Empress
magic potion.

736
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:01,116
And one day, in the palace
there was a child's cry.

737
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,716
We felt like two
inseparable sisters, 

738
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:13,599
spending holidays
in the house of her ancestors. 

739
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:15,398
We do not think about nothing. 

740
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,792
We did not know jealousy,
bitterness and envy. 

741
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:24,351
We just wanted to be together. 

742
00:52:15,560 --> 00:52:17,755
Let's go to.

743
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,394
Cute Chick.
in my ears ringing.

744
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,269
Where are we going?
to the bar to drink.

745
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,477
What'll you have?

746
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:54,632
There is a menu? No, wait.
What do you have to drink?

747
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,075
We have all.
I see you city.

748
00:52:57,240 --> 00:53:01,199
We have all,
What would you like.

749
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:02,793
You want to see the menu?

750
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,871
And do you have?

751
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,752
Look cocktail Christina.
10,000 lei.

752
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,990
He has 12,500.

753
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,720
Let it.
What does it look like?

754
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,237
No? Then let two Becks.
How about a cigarette?

755
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,595
Snagov, Carpathians or imported?

756
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,672
I think we could Snagov
and in Bucharest to take.

757
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,476
Do you want to Snagov?
No, the Carpathians.

758
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,596
The first time I came
in this bar.

759
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:40,115
It's just cool.
I want to move to your town.

760
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:42,953
Everything here is so cool.

761
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,748
A cigarette?
I forgot.

762
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,229
Can you bring them?
Now.

763
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,511
Firework!
Firework!

764
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:09,516
On this glass lip prints
all those who ever drank out of it!

765
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,196
people used to
not care about hygiene.

766
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,793
Cleanliness has made us weaker.

767
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,996
It suppresses our desires.

768
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:21,712
At first, you feel the smell of a loved one,
and then everything else.

769
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,957
And the smell of my skin?
Strong.

770
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,031
Here.

771
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,438
What does it mean much?

772
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:40,916
You smell like torn
flower in a vase,

773
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:44,072
which has long been one
I did not change the water.

774
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:49,591
You smell like a dream, like
in the morning when you wake up

775
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,752
after a very long sleep.

776
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,349
Do you like Sandhu?
I mean, as a woman?

777
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,479
He's a nice guy.
Good looking.

778
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:06,994
He is my brother.

779
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,549
Brothers and sisters
sometimes they fall.

780
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,073
Like Rene.

781
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,514
Like what?

782
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:18,312
Rene at Chateaubriand.
History of hopeless love.

783
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:21,517
This is the story of hopeless love,
it is not real.

784
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,477
If the writer believed in it,

785
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:25,676
that Rene and his sister
We would have had a chance.

786
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,239
But he wrote a story

787
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,516
for all
it was sad.

788
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,432
No you're wrong.

789
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:34,319
Although, it seems doomed,

790
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,118
his love for his sister

791
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,033
It could be the same,
as in any normal relationship,

792
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,191
if he was willing to accept,

793
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,874
in happiness as in misfortune,
there are some nuances.

794
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,554
You speak as if this
Rene was a real story.

795
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,792
I do not think it's even
not a love story.

796
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:51,791
This is just an example
romantic virtues

797
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,428
with a simplified look
the world.

798
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,397
Just remember, it's all nonsense.

799
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,835
Freud is already analyzed.

800
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,549
His mother died in childbirth,
sister committed suicide.

801
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:05,075
And wherein,
God is just.

802
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,470
There are either black or white.

803
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,315
The story of love has no chance,
if the author does not believe in it.

804
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,550
And besides, if you tell
the story monk

805
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,312
it becomes a confession,

806
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,835
and it means to
morally

807
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,231
that you condemn him,
in spite of your feelings.

808
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:23,834
Understood?

809
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:40,314
But, leaving the author
abstraction,

810
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,871
do you think the relationship
between Renee and Emily

811
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:48,430
based on a true story
or invented?

812
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,556
What do you think?

813
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,868
I was wondering if

814
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,759
we analyze and condemn
these relations,

815
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,309
in fact they can not be
somewhat dirty.

816
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:01,312
You think like a saint!

817
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,835
Let's go to.

818
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,436
You can not look for an excuse

819
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,830
relations
that are considered indecent.

820
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,355
It should be remembered in history

821
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:18,317
her biographical elements,
because from the moment of birth,

822
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,152
heroes lived
under the shadow of death.

823
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,276
And his sister took over
the role of mother.

824
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:23,919
This ultimately leads us

825
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,514
for older
and more beautiful stories.

826
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:28,955
I like this story.

827
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,158
Want to take a walk
or play football?

828
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,799
Previously, I played well!

829
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:40,190
Look, here home
not far away.

830
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:41,634
I see you have a romantic
mood today.

831
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,028
You do not care Chateaubriand?

832
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,715
In fact, this story
very obscene.

833
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,233
It angers you,

834
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,472
but you can not judge, because
it is based on noble feelings.

835
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,632
Go on.

836
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,749
I like their recklessness,
irresponsibility,

837
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,673
in which they justify
their sexual impulses

838
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:18,628
seeking answers to them
a change in their nature.

839
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,109
It is as if I said,
that city life

840
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:24,829
It made me love you.

841
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,549
There's nothing real
of Rene and Emilia.

842
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,759
I know from experience,
all very different.

843
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,151
You mean your experience
with Sandu?

844
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:37,150
As with any relationship,

845
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:39,788
one person can be
normal, and the other immoral.

846
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,032
But this does not make
immoral relations in general.

847
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:46,636
Who among you is immoral?

848
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,112
Sandu.

849
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,793
You do not know how he is.

850
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:56,509
He is capable of anything,
if he wants something.

851
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,717
Tomorrow he leaves for Switzerland
and leave me alone,

852
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,916
because he wants to.

853
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,719
Okay it does not matter.

854
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:09,590
But you're not alone.
Are you with me.

855
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,310
And along with it.

856
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:25,319
Can you take off your jacket?

857
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:28,358
I want to see your chest
in the moonlight.

858
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,273
I was very hurt when
You went with your brother.

859
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,634
When?

860
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,669
When I waited for 20 minutes
you are in a taxi.

861
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,990
Did I do something,
that upset you?

862
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:59,870
No. Today I am very happy.

863
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:18,479
You do breast augmentation surgery,
if I ask you?

864
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,313
You mean to increase them?

865
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:26,076
More less...
I just want to know you'll do it.

866
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,913
Come on, Sanduta!

867
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,594
You want me to have
They have big breasts?

868
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:36,390
No, because I have a little.
But still?

869
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:43,159
Maybe for you. But I will
unpleasant if someone else will touch me.

870
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,795
And how do you go
to the gynecologist?

871
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,951
Never he was not.

872
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:57,273
It's horrible.
It is not nice ...

873
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:07,428
For me, the breast, as accessories.
The same as earrings.

874
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,948
It is a pity that we had not met before.

875
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:48,276
Alexandra!
There's someone at the gate.

876
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,871
There Sandu.

877
01:01:57,760 --> 01:01:59,159
I gave the address of your parents.

878
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:02,630
Maybe they told him,
where to find me.

879
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:03,796
Kiki!

880
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,951
Would you call it here?

881
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:11,471
Come on! He is calling you.

882
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,312
I will not go.
Tell him I'm not here.

883
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,914
Tell him that I went to Bucharest
yesterday.

884
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,390
Why?
I do not want to see him.

885
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,158
Hey.
Good afternoon.

886
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:30,117
Hey.
Hey.

887
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:32,635
This is my mom.
This brother of Christina.

888
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,870
Rosalia Dragneya. Nice to meet you.
Sandu.

889
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,429
Where is my sister?
I have a week trying to get through to her.

890
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,828
She is not responding.

891
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:41,230
She's here, but asked me to
say that it is not.

892
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,549
Very funny.

893
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,631
True,
she does not want to see you.

894
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:46,916
Well, call it a minute.

895
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:49,719
Kiki, come out!

896
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,359
Christina!

897
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:53,397
Kiki, let's talk!

898
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,836
Do not make a scene.
Come here for a minute.

899
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:58,595
Speak!

900
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:01,035
I came to pick you up in Bucharest.

901
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,350
What for?
Why You turned off the phone?

902
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,192
If I have important news?
What kind?

903
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:08,432
Maybe I died or became ill.

904
01:03:08,600 --> 01:03:11,353
Sandhu, we agreed,
and you break the contract.

905
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,398
You have come here with no warning,
and even accusing me of something.

906
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,551
And you bring it all with you.

907
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:19,109
Mrs. Negulesko lent
me his car,

908
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:20,474
because you took my dad's.

909
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,915
It does not matter.
Why did you come here?

910
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,069
Hello!

911
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:26,470
Why do we stand here.
Come into the house.

912
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:29,108
Say what you want to say.

913
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:32,913
I asked you not to come.

914
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:46,517
Why did they quarrel?
I do not know, Mom.

915
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:49,069
Brother and sister
cursing, bad ...

916
01:03:49,240 --> 01:03:51,754
Hello. Excuse me.
Do you have a toilet?

917
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,911
Yes.
Where?

918
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:57,675
behind the house.
Thank you. I hope you do not mind.

919
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,273
Of course.

920
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,755
And who is it?
The chief of her brother.

921
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,434
Good morning!

922
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:10,513
I would now be sat omelette
with dill and pepper.

923
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,193
Girls Have you had breakfast?
Yes.

924
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,998
Good morning.

925
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,034
Good morning.

926
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,919
I'm sorry to trouble you.
We talked and decided everything.

927
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,072
You must forgive Christina.
She rides with me.

928
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:24,229
You are leaving?
No!

929
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,913
that means no?
I do not go anywhere.

930
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,354
What do you say to me
a minute ago?

931
01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:29,272
Even less than a minute?
You're crazy?

932
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:33,035
You sick pervert
are you not in control.

933
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:36,272
Do you think I was driving 200 km in this hole,
that you made a fool of me?

934
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,192
Why did you come?
Just a quarrel with me?

935
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,873
Go away and leave me.
what?

936
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:42,156
Pack your bags
or I'll knock you out of this shit!

937
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,355
Yeah, right now! Get out from here!

938
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,397
You know, you can not do without me
a month to live.

939
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:47,312
Take your old woman
and the wali in his Syrlandiyu!

940
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,835
Get your things, or I swear to God,
You get away from me!

941
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:52,190
Who the hell are you?
Get away!

942
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:54,430
Mind your own business!
Who is this hell?

943
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:57,239
Kiki, I'm a pervert?
Tell everyone, even listen to!

944
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,914
Am I first touched your pussy
or you first grabbed my cock?

945
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,230
Well, tell me!
Who started it?

946
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,839
You dare curse in my yard?

947
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:12,515
Dont touch me,
farmer!

948
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,830
You talk with me
in my own backyard?

949
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:18,276
Get out, you pervert!
Your daughter is a pervert!

950
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,113
She was just a lesbian,
they fuck with my sister!

951
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:22,269
Who is it?

952
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:26,797
I am a brother of Christine, you asshole!
Dont touch me!

953
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:29,679
Sorry for the noise.

954
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,118
Look at you. Until then
you down? Below is nowhere to go.

955
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,599
Go.

956
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,112
Christina! You are welcome!

957
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,748
Let's go, I said. Now!

958
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,635
Kiki, come out.
They left.

959
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,119
Leave me alone.

960
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,032
Oh please.

961
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,351
I can not. Leave me.

962
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:31,592
Alexander, baby,
Who are these people?

963
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,313
This is Christine.
And Sandhu, her brother.

964
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:36,913
I know who she is.

965
01:06:37,080 --> 01:06:40,550
What I want to know how
did you meet such people.

966
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:43,393
You're our girl,
and we trust you.

967
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,437
I did not do anything.

968
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,114
We think you'll be okay
behave in Bucharest.

969
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,316
you will not be friends
with bad people.

970
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:54,075
I can not take it anymore.
You made us a laughing stock!

971
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:57,437
Leave it now.
It's enough.

972
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:01,438
We raised you as best they could.

973
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:04,876
And you went to Bucharest and
pierced ears.

974
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,953
Why Alexander? Just say
me why? I do not understand!

975
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,750
I gather things.

976
01:07:16,920 --> 01:07:19,878
Petrik, go down.

977
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:27,433
I will go, or this crazy
anything will do.

978
01:07:27,600 --> 01:07:30,239
You want me to go with you?

979
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,952
No, that's my business.

980
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,355
You are free?
Yes. Where are you going?

981
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,432
Lipskani.
Sit down.

982
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,629
I can not get to Lipskani.
Where do you land?

983
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:25,509
I thought about it and let you know.
Good.

984
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:31,555
You can drive
through Drumul Taber?

985
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,032
I can drop off you to the slopes,
if you want to.

986
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,909
And where in the Drumul Taber?
Poiana Montelui.

987
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:41,911
Good.

988
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,790
Who's there?

989
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:17,957
Hello, Aunt Lucretia.

990
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:21,590
Hi, honey. what happened?
I'm back.

991
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,716
You scared me to death.

992
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:27,111
I heard a noise outside the door,
and I thought it was thieves.

993
01:10:27,280 --> 01:10:28,713
I greeted him loudly.

994
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:30,836
You said you come back
a month later?

995
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,115
He returned earlier.

996
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:35,477
Good. I did not touch anything in the
your room, everything is the same.

997
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,189
Christine did not come?
No, I am also waiting for her.

998
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:41,349
To report it,
I almost died,

999
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:43,476
because it took diclofenac,
she said.

1000
01:10:43,640 --> 01:10:44,993
I had terrible diarrhea.

1001
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,630
I was lucky that his nephew came,
He took me to the hospital, otherwise ...

1002
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,948
I can put products
in the refrigerator?

1003
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:54,839
Of course, luggage.

1004
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:00,714
So you were in the hospital?
No, God forbid!

1005
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,474
If I'll go to the hospital,
I'm just going to die.

1006
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:05,153
My longest visit to the hospital
I was 70,

1007
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,630
when I had an operation on his legs,
I could hardly walk.

1008
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,916
Otherwise, I would have died.

1009
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:15,198
Tell me, what about the money?

1010
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,316
But my father paid
October?

1011
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,153
Yes, but I struck out you
from the list in the public service.

1012
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:23,756
Bring me to the list.
And then striking out again?

1013
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:25,148
Why delete?

1014
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,916
My mom put me a cake.
Want to?

1015
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:35,235
I sugar may rise.

1016
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,870
But you will not leave again?
I'll stay here till the end of the period.

1017
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:40,189
You can stay and after the deadline.

1018
01:11:40,360 --> 01:11:43,432
I'm talking about vacation. You do not
dogulivat collect them?

1019
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,192
I dont know.

1020
01:11:45,360 --> 01:11:48,670
I watched when you were here.

1021
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,150
You are a good girl.
Never drive a boy.

1022
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,390
And if you
pay money,

1023
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:56,278
regularly every month,

1024
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:59,159
I can make you an offer.

1025
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,673
I will think about it.

1026
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:04,913
I know it's expensive for you,
but I can do a little bit cheaper.

1027
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,311
You and Christine
such a cute girl,

1028
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,391
I feel good with you.

1029
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,278
I will think about it.

1030
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:35,798
Hey.

1031
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:37,234
Hey.

1032
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:45,718
You are alone?

1033
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,470
You will die in the stench.

1034
01:12:53,640 --> 01:12:56,234
I am a country girl.
To all familiar.

1035
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:59,073
Stop saying that you
rustic, you do not like that.

1036
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,038
What are you doing?

1037
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:06,398
Chicken with vegetables
and kiwi sauce.

1038
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:09,028
Where did this come from?

1039
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,760
On TV I saw.
I'm tired of all this crap.

1040
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:13,751
What the shit?

1041
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,999
Delicious.

1042
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,674
So, what are you doing?

1043
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:32,071
What did I do?
I do not even want to remember.

1044
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:34,231
It was a nightmare for me.

1045
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,517
I was with my brother,
I put up with his bad mood.

1046
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,478
You know, it's hard.

1047
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,195
Do you realize how awful
it was for him

1048
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:44,759
go, God knows where, and miss

1049
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,558
all their chances
on the future life?

1050
01:13:46,720 --> 01:13:48,711
Anyway, it is still
calmed down.

1051
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,668
It is good that you have everything in order.
I was worried about you.

1052
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:01,111
And you do not want
ask how I'm doing?

1053
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:05,068
I do not blame you,
but your indifference kills.

1054
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,037
You will be surprised to learn,
I was looking for you.

1055
01:14:07,200 --> 01:14:08,633
I came for you in Bucharest.

1056
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,234
I went to your brother,
to your parents.

1057
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,995
Your mother did not tell you,
I'm asking about you every day?

1058
01:14:15,160 --> 01:14:17,151
However, it does not matter.

1059
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:22,952
I do not communicate with their parents.
We had a falling out.

1060
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:24,633
You could call me.

1061
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,236
I wanted to see you.
Well, it does not matter.

1062
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:29,879
You're right.
It is important that I came back.

1063
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:31,837
And we can go there,
where you left off.

1064
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:36,198
There's nothing to go on.
I packed your things.

1065
01:14:36,360 --> 01:14:38,954
They are bagged in the room.

1066
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:41,509
Why are you doing it?

1067
01:14:42,840 --> 01:14:44,831
Here they are.

1068
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:50,470
Do not do this.

1069
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:53,473
I had things to do.

1070
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:56,393
I'm sorry, really.

1071
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,312
Perhaps I was wrong.
I know that was wrong.

1072
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:01,597
I wanted to call you,
Sandu but he's just come into a rage.

1073
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:04,593
Let's continue, please.

1074
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,113
I do not believe you anymore.

1075
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:16,150
You lied to me
and continue to lie.

1076
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:22,555
As you no honesty drop.
You have no idea what it is.

1077
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,679
Benes also at home?

1078
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:29,158
Let's go somewhere to talk?

1079
01:15:30,920 --> 01:15:34,037
There is nothing to talk about.

1080
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:37,795
I've been thinking about this.

1081
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:39,234
I was an idiot.

1082
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:43,109
It was clear from the outset,
I just love you too.

1083
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:48,035
I love you!
Why are you angry?

1084
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,634
A month ago, I was wrong.
That's what you left me.

1085
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:54,190
I mean, I left you?
I'm telling you, I had a problem.

1086
01:15:54,360 --> 01:15:58,035
You will always be problems.
You can not live without them.

1087
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:02,671
And now you want to ruin everything?
Do you want me to suffer?

1088
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:07,311
Why do you want to leave me,
if you know how it hurts?

1089
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,278
Please, go away.

1090
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:17,232
I can not go! I do not want!

1091
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,278
I do not believe you. I do not believe,
that you really want it.

1092
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,112
You want that I
I asked for forgiveness?

1093
01:16:22,280 --> 01:16:24,714
I promise I will not, I swear,
this will not happen again.

1094
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,279
You want that I
I knelt?

1095
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:29,034
Look, I'm on my knees.

1096
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:36,191
How can you say,
that it will not happen again?

1097
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:44,993
You look me in the eye
while lying.

1098
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,435
Can not you see?

1099
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,397
You are welcome...

1100
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,788
You have broken my heart,
you know?

1101
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:01,997
I have emptiness inside.
There is nothing there.

1102
01:17:02,160 --> 01:17:07,712
And whatever you say
not correct the situation.

1103
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:10,838
I want to forget you.
Take your things and go.

1104
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,230
If I'm gone, I'm not going back.

1105
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,514
You are threatening me?

1106
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:22,355
You and so do not come back.
You're somewhere else.

1107
01:17:22,520 --> 01:17:26,229
You can not be honest.

1108
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:29,949
I was honest with you.

1109
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:33,112
I said I love you,
I love you too.

1110
01:17:33,280 --> 01:17:36,397
I'm still loving you.

1111
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,028
When we arrived
in your parents' house,

1112
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:42,431
Do you think it was a lie,
everything I told you?

1113
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:48,915
I told you that?
And you remember?

1114
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:51,310
There's nothing to remember.

1115
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:54,278
I could not get back to you
after all that happened there.

1116
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,910
I had to leave,
so that later it was easier.

1117
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,358
You do not have to suffer.

1118
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,670
What has happened does not matter.

1119
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:08,389
You know perfectly well that this is not so.

1120
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:15,590
Take your things.
It pains me to see them.

1121
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:38,435
Now what do I do?

1122
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,789
We will not see each other again?

1123
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:48,157
You want to
I promised it to you?

1124
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,039
Okay. While you're here,
I move to Sandu.

1125
01:18:52,280 --> 01:18:54,874
If you do not want to see,
then we will not.

1126
01:18:55,040 --> 01:18:58,237
I promise, you will not see me,
I will keep my promise.

1127
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:04,279
You want to end it all,
as if nothing had happened.

1128
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:10,834
You say that you forget everything,
Do you think we really forget?

1129
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,834
I thought, you know
what I'm doing.

1130
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,310
I did everything that we could
be happy together.

1131
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:23,109
Tell me you do not want,
that we were together?

1132
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:26,477
You do not want to see me?

1133
01:19:28,120 --> 01:19:30,839
Well, we do not see each other again.

1134
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,991
Never.

1135
01:19:42,840 --> 01:19:45,991
Take things.

1136
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:53,868
For most people, we just
good friends, 

1137
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:56,474
who were able to find their place
in this world, 

1138
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:59,393
only some
know something about us. 

1139
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:03,075
And only we, only,
who knows all about us. 

1140
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:06,789
We have no idea,
that was between us, 

1141
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,474
but it was something good. 

1142
01:21:33,720 --> 01:21:36,314
In memory of my grandmother Lila

1143
01:21:36,680 --> 01:21:39,399
