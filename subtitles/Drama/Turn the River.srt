1
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,126
Hi, Mr. Quinette.

2
00:02:08,194 --> 00:02:09,495
Whoa!

3
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,729
Come here!

4
00:02:10,796 --> 00:02:13,566
Come on back up!
I got one for you.

5
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,567
Really?

6
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:16,569
Yeah!

7
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,243
Here.

8
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:24,611
Thanks.

9
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:26,612
<i>No problem, hombre.</i>

10
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:32,819
Nope, still fours.

11
00:02:32,887 --> 00:02:34,354
Pair of kings.

12
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:36,089
Who knows? And... crap.

13
00:02:36,157 --> 00:02:38,426
Kings bet.

14
00:02:38,494 --> 00:02:40,427
Five.

15
00:02:47,102 --> 00:02:49,237
God, what the fuck are
you doing in this hand?

16
00:02:49,305 --> 00:02:50,506
What?

17
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:51,607
For the last three hours,

18
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:53,742
you've been playing
cards like a moron.

19
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,077
Yeah, I know.

20
00:02:55,145 --> 00:02:58,080
Hey, uh... what does
"cotillion" mean?

21
00:02:58,148 --> 00:03:00,383
I don't know.
A flower?

22
00:03:00,451 --> 00:03:01,651
Yeah? I don't know.

23
00:03:01,719 --> 00:03:02,852
Dance, it's
a dance class.

24
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,321
Can we have the
next card, please?

25
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:06,923
Take it easy,
Randolph.

26
00:03:10,428 --> 00:03:11,695
Twenty.

27
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,698
Call.

28
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,508
Twenty.

29
00:03:22,575 --> 00:03:24,542
Up 20.

30
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,479
Up 20 again.

31
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,815
Up 60.

32
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:32,184
Fine.

33
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,621
Full house.
Kings full.

34
00:03:38,225 --> 00:03:40,225
Four fours.

35
00:03:40,293 --> 00:03:42,195
Oh, for fuck's sake!

36
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,564
You should never go
up against her.

37
00:03:44,632 --> 00:03:45,733
She's already got
your new truck.

38
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,166
No, she does not
have my truck.

39
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:48,167
Well, she's driving it.

40
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,335
All right, cash me.

41
00:03:49,403 --> 00:03:50,871
She rivered the four,
for fuck's sake!

42
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,006
Yeah.

43
00:03:52,073 --> 00:03:53,274
Well, that is fucking
ridiculous.

44
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,109
I know, I'm not proud of it,
but there it is.

45
00:03:57,646 --> 00:03:58,779
I gotta go.

46
00:03:58,847 --> 00:04:00,015
Oh, great, now she scats.

47
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:02,283
No, I said I was going
an hour ago.

48
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,021
Okay, thanks for the game,
and thanks for the vocab help.

49
00:04:06,088 --> 00:04:07,556
Play a few more hands
and I'll go with you.

50
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,157
I can't; I got
to go to the city.

51
00:04:09,225 --> 00:04:10,325
Right.
Drive safe.

52
00:04:10,393 --> 00:04:11,326
Yep.

53
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:12,661
Take care
of my truck.

54
00:04:12,728 --> 00:04:14,664
It's not your truck.

55
00:04:55,542 --> 00:04:56,475
Hi, Sal.

56
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:57,476
Hey!

57
00:04:57,544 --> 00:04:58,778
Still open?

58
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:01,347
Not really, but I'll
get you a beer.

59
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:02,748
Thanks.

60
00:05:08,789 --> 00:05:10,290
Thanks.

61
00:05:13,128 --> 00:05:16,229
How are things?

62
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,533
Tired.

63
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,167
You going to the city?

64
00:05:20,235 --> 00:05:22,803
Yeah, got a little
ahead of myself.

65
00:05:45,396 --> 00:05:46,496
You keep watching us.

66
00:05:46,564 --> 00:05:48,798
Yeah.

67
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,367
You want to play?

68
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,136
What do you
usually play for?

69
00:05:53,204 --> 00:05:54,538
Five bucks a rack.

70
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:59,543
You know what?

71
00:05:59,611 --> 00:06:03,315
I got to be in the city soon,
so, uh, how about 20 a rack?

72
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:05,116
And I'll give a lot of weight.

73
00:06:28,742 --> 00:06:31,211
Dad, I got to go
to school early today.

74
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:35,582
What time is it?

75
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,717
Morning, Gulls.

76
00:06:36,784 --> 00:06:38,919
Morning.
It's like 7:00, but remember,

77
00:06:38,987 --> 00:06:41,389
I told you we have to do
a project in English class?

78
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:42,624
Yeah.

79
00:06:42,691 --> 00:06:43,957
So, I gotta go.

80
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:44,993
Okay.

81
00:07:10,488 --> 00:07:12,056
Oh!

82
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,891
Crap, Mom.

83
00:07:17,796 --> 00:07:19,463
Hi, Gulls.

84
00:07:19,531 --> 00:07:21,299
Get off the
sidewalk, will ya?

85
00:07:21,366 --> 00:07:24,268
Yeah, in a couple years,
when you're taller.

86
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:27,638
But not yet.

87
00:07:27,706 --> 00:07:29,240
What's this?

88
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:30,976
I just
busted my hand.

89
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:32,377
How'd you do that?

90
00:07:32,445 --> 00:07:34,645
Just fell.

91
00:07:34,713 --> 00:07:36,114
You didn't
write me about it.

92
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:37,416
It's not a big deal.

93
00:07:37,483 --> 00:07:39,986
What, don't kids
sign casts anymore?

94
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:42,421
Not really.

95
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:44,357
And this is what
you have to wear?

96
00:07:44,425 --> 00:07:46,426
Yeah, sixth grade.

97
00:07:46,493 --> 00:07:48,294
Coming down the street, I
thought maybe you'd become

98
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:50,129
a lawyer
or something.

99
00:07:51,332 --> 00:07:53,734
So, how's sixth grade?

100
00:07:53,802 --> 00:07:56,237
You know, now I'm the youngest
in middle school,

101
00:07:56,304 --> 00:07:59,640
instead of the oldest in lower,
so... you know, it's cool.

102
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,642
You mean, you're
picked on a bit?

103
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,211
Yeah, sometimes.

104
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:05,646
Is that how you got
your hand busted?

105
00:08:05,714 --> 00:08:07,682
Nuh-uh.
I just fell.

106
00:08:09,952 --> 00:08:14,823
Okay, well, uh... don't pick
back too much, okay?

107
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:16,259
I got a letter for you.

108
00:08:16,326 --> 00:08:18,327
Oh, that's great, Gulls.
You know that I had to

109
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:19,961
look up "Cotillion"
from your last one.

110
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,297
Yeah? That's horrible.

111
00:08:21,365 --> 00:08:24,834
So, what else... what else
is middle school like?

112
00:08:24,902 --> 00:08:27,236
Well, it's
kind of the same.

113
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:30,240
<i>It's boring. I have to read
Johnny Tremain.</i>

114
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,376
What's that about?

115
00:08:32,443 --> 00:08:34,243
This kid who makes silver bowls
with Paul Revere

116
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:36,313
and gets his hand burned.

117
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,350
You like it?

118
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:40,884
It's okay. Not really.

119
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,219
I can't finish it.

120
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,923
Yeah, and anyway,
silversmithing

121
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:47,725
will probably get in the
way of your lawyering.

122
00:08:47,793 --> 00:08:49,060
Yeah.

123
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:53,699
How's your dad and Ellen?

124
00:08:53,767 --> 00:08:56,034
Fine.

125
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:58,270
Yeah, you like her
any better now?

126
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,772
She's okay.

127
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,106
She's a pretty good cook,

128
00:09:01,174 --> 00:09:04,243
but she gets angry
about the weirdest things.

129
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,978
Like what?

130
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,882
Like sometimes, after
I wash my hands,

131
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,516
she says I leave
the soap dirty.

132
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:11,785
What does that mean?

133
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,287
I know. It means I'm supposed
to wash the soap

134
00:09:14,355 --> 00:09:16,924
after I wash my hands.

135
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,060
Well...

136
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,933
But sometimes when she talks to
her friends, she says things.

137
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:26,400
Like what?

138
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:29,470
Like once I heard her say--
about you, I guess--

139
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,908
that they wanted you
to get a... annulment?

140
00:09:33,976 --> 00:09:35,477
That who wanted?

141
00:09:35,545 --> 00:09:38,480
I guess Dad and Grandma.

142
00:09:38,548 --> 00:09:39,982
Oh.

143
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,984
And I asked Eric
Muftie what that was,

144
00:09:42,051 --> 00:09:43,887
and he said it was
something dirty.

145
00:09:43,954 --> 00:09:44,888
A sex thing.

146
00:09:44,955 --> 00:09:47,090
Who's Eric Muftie?

147
00:09:47,157 --> 00:09:48,958
A kid in my class.

148
00:09:49,026 --> 00:09:51,060
Well, Eric is wrong.

149
00:09:51,128 --> 00:09:52,563
Good.

150
00:09:52,631 --> 00:09:54,265
It's-It's not a...
it's not a sex thing at all.

151
00:09:54,332 --> 00:09:55,265
Good.

152
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:58,335
It's sort of like a...

153
00:09:58,403 --> 00:10:00,104
Sort of the same
thing as a divorce.

154
00:10:00,171 --> 00:10:02,039
Oh.

155
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:04,308
You already got one.

156
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:08,580
You don't really need to worry
about it, okay?

157
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:09,813
Okay.

158
00:10:09,881 --> 00:10:11,650
I promise you,
Eric is wrong.

159
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:12,651
Good.

160
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:14,452
It's not a dirty
thing at all.

161
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,522
Okay.

162
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,722
Here's your letter.

163
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:21,160
Thanks, Gulls.
Got to get going.

164
00:10:27,534 --> 00:10:29,369
Why can't you just
write to me at home?

165
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:30,837
Why? You don't
like Mr. Quinette?

166
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:33,272
He's nice, but sometimes
he isn't there.

167
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:34,841
So I think maybe
I missed one.

168
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:36,543
No, if there's a
letter, he'll be there.

169
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:38,278
Okay.

170
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,214
I think it's a pretty cool
system, don't you?

171
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:41,215
I guess.

172
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:42,216
A secret system.

173
00:10:42,283 --> 00:10:43,351
Yeah.

174
00:10:43,419 --> 00:10:46,653
Gulls, you got to keep it
a secret, okay?

175
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:47,989
I know.

176
00:10:48,057 --> 00:10:49,490
And after you read
one of my letters,

177
00:10:49,558 --> 00:10:50,992
make sure to just
throw them away, okay?

178
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,528
I do.

179
00:10:52,596 --> 00:10:54,162
Good.

180
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,396
Okay, tell me more.

181
00:10:55,464 --> 00:10:57,399
Are you on a team?
- Yeah.

182
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,567
Soccer, but B team.

183
00:10:58,635 --> 00:10:59,969
What position?
- Left wing.

184
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,135
Left wing. Really?

185
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,404
That's pretty hard, right?

186
00:11:02,472 --> 00:11:05,274
You got to be kicking
with your left foot a lot.

187
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:06,643
Yeah.
- How are you?

188
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:09,478
Okay. I mean, it's B team,
so it's mostly 'tards.

189
00:11:09,546 --> 00:11:12,349
Well, better to be a big
fish in a small pond.

190
00:11:12,416 --> 00:11:14,751
Even if all the other fish
are 'tard fish?

191
00:11:14,819 --> 00:11:19,189
Yeah. Even then.

192
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:20,892
I, uh...

193
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,727
I should stop here.

194
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:24,929
When are you coming back?

195
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:27,498
Well, it'll be sooner
than last time.

196
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:28,867
Probably a couple of weeks.

197
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,135
Two weeks?

198
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:31,669
Probably three.
- No, four.

199
00:11:31,737 --> 00:11:33,037
No, definitely not four.

200
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:34,606
But send me
letters, okay?

201
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:36,174
Okay.

202
00:11:40,914 --> 00:11:42,949
Okay.

203
00:11:45,451 --> 00:11:47,119
Keep your nose
clean, kid.

204
00:11:47,186 --> 00:11:49,122
Okay.

205
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:51,926
Okay. I love you, Gulls.

206
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:53,126
Me, too.

207
00:11:53,193 --> 00:11:54,761
Mm. Okay.

208
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:56,062
Now, go on.

209
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:58,532
I'll see you soon, okay?

210
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,767
Couple of weeks?

211
00:11:59,834 --> 00:12:00,934
Yeah, a couple.

212
00:12:01,002 --> 00:12:02,269
<i>And try reading that
Johnny, uh,</i>

213
00:12:02,337 --> 00:12:04,405
what's-his-face book
one more time, okay?

214
00:12:04,472 --> 00:12:06,441
I can't, Mom.
I swear, it's horrible.

215
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:09,777
Forget it. Forget it.

216
00:12:09,844 --> 00:12:11,580
Go on, don't be late.

217
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,648
Okay.

218
00:13:13,546 --> 00:13:16,549
Kailey, Jesus.

219
00:13:16,617 --> 00:13:18,485
Look at you.

220
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:23,858
I know, I know,
I know.

221
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:25,693
I've been up for a few days.

222
00:13:25,761 --> 00:13:27,228
I'm not so sure

223
00:13:27,296 --> 00:13:29,797
it's the long
hours hurting you.

224
00:13:29,865 --> 00:13:31,799
Yeah.

225
00:13:33,369 --> 00:13:35,304
Well, I see Gulley
every day.

226
00:13:35,371 --> 00:13:37,338
He looks good.

227
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,975
I saw him
this morning.

228
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:42,912
His arm's broken.

229
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,546
I saw that.

230
00:13:44,614 --> 00:13:45,714
It's okay.

231
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:47,750
Yeah. He's
doing great.

232
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,019
He's a good kid.

233
00:13:53,324 --> 00:13:54,624
Is there a game around?

234
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:56,227
You see anything?

235
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:59,929
Even if there
were, I mean...

236
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,865
you're a mess.

237
00:14:01,933 --> 00:14:03,667
You got enough
for hotel room?

238
00:14:03,735 --> 00:14:07,605
Yeah, but, uh, I'd rather
use it to get a game.

239
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:08,906
Want to sleep here a bit?

240
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:10,275
You mind?

241
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:11,776
Go ahead.

242
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:13,611
Thanks.

243
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:18,016
Come get me if there's something
I should be awake for, okay?

244
00:14:18,084 --> 00:14:20,085
Got you.

245
00:15:12,642 --> 00:15:15,478
How was that
English project?

246
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:17,080
The what?

247
00:15:17,148 --> 00:15:19,583
That thing
you had to be in early for.

248
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:21,518
Oh. It was good.

249
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,521
Yeah? What book
was it on?

250
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,057
Gulley?

251
00:15:27,124 --> 00:15:29,427
It wasn't
a book.

252
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,429
It was...

253
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,198
We had to make
an advertisement.

254
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,466
Oh. For what?

255
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:37,202
Well, everybody got
different things.

256
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:38,370
What did you get?

257
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,538
Hot chocolate.
- Huh.

258
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:40,706
In English class?

259
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,040
Why would they do that?

260
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:43,408
I don't know.

261
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,043
They didn't
give you a reason?

262
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,980
No, they did.

263
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:52,952
Well, what was it?

264
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,153
Gulls, your dad's
talking to you.

265
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,356
Don't call me Gulls.

266
00:15:55,423 --> 00:15:56,456
Hey.

267
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,024
Lose the tone, young man.

268
00:15:58,092 --> 00:16:00,027
Now, what was
the reason?

269
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:03,329
My teacher says

270
00:16:03,397 --> 00:16:07,134
that poets sometimes make
advertisements for money.

271
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:10,838
So, instead of writing
a poem, we could do an ad.

272
00:16:10,906 --> 00:16:12,239
Hmm.

273
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:14,676
Swear to God,
if it was up to me,

274
00:16:14,744 --> 00:16:17,145
you'd be in
public school so fast.

275
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,947
So, how'd you do?

276
00:16:19,015 --> 00:16:20,548
We won.
- You did?

277
00:16:20,616 --> 00:16:22,117
With hot chocolate?
- Yeah.

278
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,986
Well, what
was your ad?

279
00:16:24,054 --> 00:16:26,121
We made a picture
of some mountains

280
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:28,591
with a cottage and smoke
coming out of the chimney,

281
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,393
and we called it
Jungfrau Hot Chocolate.

282
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:33,095
Jungfrau. What's that?

283
00:16:33,163 --> 00:16:34,730
It's a mountain in Switzerland.

284
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,067
No, it isn't.

285
00:16:37,135 --> 00:16:38,268
Yes, it is.

286
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,236
Jungfrau?

287
00:16:40,304 --> 00:16:41,538
Yeah.

288
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,518
It's nice you won.

289
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,102
It's not pronounced that way.

290
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,135
But it's real?

291
00:17:10,203 --> 00:17:12,438
But it's pronounced Yung Frow.

292
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:14,241
But it exists.

293
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:15,709
Not pronounced that way,
it doesn't.

294
00:17:25,786 --> 00:17:27,388
Hey.

295
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:29,390
Hi.

296
00:17:32,561 --> 00:17:34,495
Do me a favor, okay?

297
00:17:34,563 --> 00:17:35,997
Sure.

298
00:17:36,065 --> 00:17:38,667
Maybe don't lecture me
on mountains in Switzerland.

299
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,736
I-I didn't think...

300
00:17:40,803 --> 00:17:42,938
You might think you know
everything under the sun,

301
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:44,172
but trust me, you don't.

302
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,441
I know.

303
00:17:46,509 --> 00:17:47,776
Just don't
lecture me.

304
00:17:47,844 --> 00:17:49,411
Think you can
handle that?

305
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:52,248
Okay.

306
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:55,818
Terrific.

307
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:07,498
Well, good morning.

308
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:09,033
Hey.

309
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,601
How'd you sleep?
- Terrific.

310
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,707
Place looks a little better.

311
00:18:16,775 --> 00:18:18,043
Oh, yeah.

312
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,878
It's great for
a week night.

313
00:18:22,883 --> 00:18:24,716
There a game here?

314
00:18:24,784 --> 00:18:26,686
Yeah, maybe.

315
00:18:26,753 --> 00:18:28,220
That kid in the
stupid track suit--

316
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,689
he'll play you.

317
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:33,759
But he only plays
ten dollar racks.

318
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:35,829
That won't even be gas money.

319
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:39,365
Who are the guys
playing one pocket?

320
00:18:39,433 --> 00:18:41,535
The older guy

321
00:18:41,603 --> 00:18:43,470
is Duncan.

322
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,672
The other fella--
I don't know his name.

323
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,873
He's gonna quit soon.

324
00:18:46,941 --> 00:18:49,242
I ain't never seen him
won a game yet.

325
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,545
Okay. I'll try for Duncan.

326
00:18:50,613 --> 00:18:52,846
That's gonna
be a hard

327
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,282
game to get.

328
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,483
He's good.

329
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,519
He'll also try
to negotiate weight.

330
00:18:58,587 --> 00:19:01,089
Should I give him any?

331
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:02,323
No! He's good.

332
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,659
All right, I'll be

333
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,760
back in an hour.

334
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:06,395
Keep him here
if he wants a game.

335
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,752
Hey, is Markus there?

336
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:00,753
You got a number for him?

337
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:05,292
Okay, well, uh,
maybe if you run into him.

338
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,162
I know, but maybe
if you just happen to see him,

339
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,531
can you tell him
that Kailey's in the city,

340
00:20:10,599 --> 00:20:12,200
and to keep an eye out?

341
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:16,036
Kailey. K-A-I-L-E-Y.

342
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,106
He'll know.

343
00:20:24,313 --> 00:20:26,248
For Gulls tomorrow.

344
00:20:35,993 --> 00:20:37,159
You Duncan?

345
00:20:37,227 --> 00:20:38,661
I am, yeah.

346
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:40,764
Kailey.

347
00:20:40,832 --> 00:20:42,132
It's nice to meet you.

348
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,066
Want to play
some one pocket?

349
00:20:44,134 --> 00:20:45,502
Maybe. For what?

350
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,938
I don't know.

351
00:20:48,006 --> 00:20:49,807
20 a game.

352
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,709
Okay. Give me two balls.

353
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,079
No. Can't.

354
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:57,348
Quinn says I can't
give any weight.

355
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:58,616
He does, huh?

356
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:01,052
He does, and
he's a fair guy.

357
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,721
Is he staking you?

358
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:05,124
No.

359
00:21:05,191 --> 00:21:07,125
Okay.

360
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,094
Maybe. But he's wrong.

361
00:21:09,162 --> 00:21:10,729
I don't know.

362
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:12,998
Seemed to play okay
earlier tonight.

363
00:21:13,066 --> 00:21:14,600
I was playing
against Mike Simms.

364
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:15,834
Play him every week.

365
00:21:15,902 --> 00:21:17,404
Beat him every week.

366
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:19,539
He's a degenerate.
He loves to lose.

367
00:21:19,607 --> 00:21:21,541
It's no reflection.

368
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,844
How about no weight,

369
00:21:24,912 --> 00:21:27,547
but a guaranteed renegotiation
after five games?

370
00:21:27,615 --> 00:21:29,649
Okay, but we play
for a hundred a rack.

371
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:32,119
Okay.

372
00:21:32,187 --> 00:21:34,588
Lack for break.

373
00:21:34,656 --> 00:21:36,490
No, I'll give you the break.

374
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:38,025
I'll take
the right pocket.

375
00:22:21,907 --> 00:22:23,108
Seven ball.

376
00:24:10,357 --> 00:24:11,558
Nice games.

377
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:13,560
Maybe you should be
giving me a ball.

378
00:24:13,628 --> 00:24:15,697
Nope.
- But out, Quinn.

379
00:24:15,765 --> 00:24:17,097
I'll give her a ball.

380
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:18,399
Nope, she's gonna quit.

381
00:24:21,137 --> 00:24:23,038
What the fuck Quinn?!

382
00:24:23,105 --> 00:24:24,939
You pull me off a game
just when the dipshit's

383
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:26,574
about to give me a ball?!

384
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:28,443
Jesus fucking shit!

385
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,813
He ain't a dipshit.
He still would've took ya.

386
00:24:30,881 --> 00:24:32,414
Fuck you.

387
00:24:32,481 --> 00:24:33,648
Oh, fuck yourself.

388
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:35,518
You're playing like shit, Kai.

389
00:24:35,585 --> 00:24:36,919
I know it. You know it.

390
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:37,987
You're wrong.
- No.

391
00:24:38,055 --> 00:24:39,956
I easily had the last game.

392
00:24:40,023 --> 00:24:42,058
You barely got the last game.
I don't know what's

393
00:24:42,125 --> 00:24:44,061
on your mind, but,
you know, you're not

394
00:24:44,128 --> 00:24:45,829
playing half-way decent.

395
00:24:45,897 --> 00:24:46,929
Where are you going?

396
00:24:46,997 --> 00:24:48,298
To find a fucking game.

397
00:24:48,366 --> 00:24:50,600
Well, go get it.

398
00:24:54,572 --> 00:24:56,606
Kai! Kai!

399
00:25:01,513 --> 00:25:02,914
I thought you
hated this city.

400
00:25:02,982 --> 00:25:05,083
More and more
every fucking day.

401
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,318
How are you Markus?

402
00:25:06,386 --> 00:25:07,553
I'm all right.

403
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:09,654
Uh, I'm not really a
running kind of guy, so...

404
00:25:11,024 --> 00:25:12,625
Thank you.

405
00:25:12,692 --> 00:25:15,428
Oh, what are you doing in town?

406
00:25:15,496 --> 00:25:17,029
Trying to get out.

407
00:25:17,097 --> 00:25:20,300
Oh, that should be easy enough.
- No.

408
00:25:20,368 --> 00:25:22,502
Really out.
Oh.

409
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,971
I'm thinking Canada out.

410
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,141
Oh.
You could do that, right?

411
00:25:28,209 --> 00:25:29,977
I could, yeah.

412
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,978
How much would that be?

413
00:25:32,046 --> 00:25:33,146
$10,000, thereabout...

414
00:25:33,214 --> 00:25:34,382
There'll be two of us.

415
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,484
Twenty.

416
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,853
He's a kid.

417
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:41,389
Oh, that's...
that's different, Kai.

418
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,724
Yeah, I figured.

419
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:44,960
No, I mean, that's
really different.

420
00:25:45,028 --> 00:25:46,694
I can get you
a passport,

421
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,997
get you into Canada,
no problem, but...

422
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:50,365
traveling with a kid?

423
00:25:50,433 --> 00:25:52,368
<i>That is way different.</i>

424
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:55,470
They look hard-- single
adults traveling with kids.

425
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:58,041
Passport'd have to be
fucking bomb-proof.

426
00:25:58,108 --> 00:26:00,108
Can you still do it?

427
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,614
Maybe, uh...

428
00:26:04,682 --> 00:26:06,016
the price goes up.

429
00:26:06,084 --> 00:26:07,750
How much up?

430
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:08,851
Fifty, at least.

431
00:26:14,859 --> 00:26:16,160
How long?

432
00:26:16,227 --> 00:26:18,162
Couple of weeks.

433
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,135
Let's do it.

434
00:26:24,203 --> 00:26:26,004
Where are you going?

435
00:26:26,072 --> 00:26:27,973
To raise your fucking money.

436
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,808
What about Mexico?

437
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:32,077
I don't speak Spanish, Markus.

438
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:34,080
Mexico's nice.

439
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:08,583
Hey, uh...

440
00:27:08,651 --> 00:27:10,185
Jameson neat, water back.

441
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,463
Thanks.

442
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,474
Four Buds.

443
00:27:33,211 --> 00:27:34,745
Are those guys your boyfriends?

444
00:27:36,213 --> 00:27:38,149
What?

445
00:27:38,216 --> 00:27:39,784
Why don't you invite
me on your team?

446
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:41,987
What?

447
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:42,988
Invite me on your team.

448
00:27:43,056 --> 00:27:44,255
Why?

449
00:27:44,323 --> 00:27:45,856
Because it might
be fun to beat them.

450
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:52,164
Take my place.

451
00:27:52,231 --> 00:27:53,899
Really?

452
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:56,569
Yeah. Fucking hate this game.

453
00:27:58,071 --> 00:28:00,606
That guy your boyfriend?

454
00:28:00,674 --> 00:28:02,608
Depends on who you ask.

455
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:04,677
I suppose I'll ask you.

456
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:07,013
Nope.

457
00:28:07,081 --> 00:28:09,550
Okay, then.

458
00:28:13,153 --> 00:28:15,022
She's playing for Kat.

459
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,156
What?

460
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:18,125
She's on my team.
Okay.

461
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:19,928
No, no, who the
fuck is this?

462
00:28:19,996 --> 00:28:22,029
Come on, let's play.
It'd be fun.

463
00:28:22,097 --> 00:28:23,999
Lady, this isn't, uh...

464
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:25,166
like, you know,
an open thing.

465
00:28:25,234 --> 00:28:27,335
Come on. It'll be fun.

466
00:28:28,738 --> 00:28:30,305
Seriously.
Fuck off.

467
00:28:30,373 --> 00:28:31,673
No, Brad.

468
00:28:31,741 --> 00:28:33,843
Let her play.

469
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,810
Okay. Here's, uh...

470
00:28:35,878 --> 00:28:37,480
hundred dollars.

471
00:28:37,547 --> 00:28:38,814
I'm gonna play you

472
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:41,150
or the both of you.
I'm gonna play with--

473
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,351
sorry, what's your name again?
Charlotte.

474
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:44,120
Charlotte here...
and we'll beat you.

475
00:28:45,589 --> 00:28:48,091
Okay.

476
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,859
But, uh, both
of us play you.

477
00:28:49,926 --> 00:28:52,396
Sure. Do you
have a hundred dollars?

478
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,831
Bitch.

479
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,000
Nice talk.

480
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,134
Go ahead and break.

481
00:29:14,854 --> 00:29:16,855
Fuck!

482
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,357
Do you want to go?

483
00:29:18,426 --> 00:29:20,192
You can.

484
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,560
Nah, go for it.

485
00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:34,240
Uh, take the three.
Which one?

486
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:35,809
Just hit it right there,

487
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,045
and it'll roll down the side.

488
00:29:44,786 --> 00:29:46,722
Sorry.

489
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:52,361
Don't fucking choke.

490
00:29:52,428 --> 00:29:54,196
Just sink
a fucking ball.

491
00:29:58,067 --> 00:30:00,003
Oh!

492
00:30:43,850 --> 00:30:45,786
Fuck you!

493
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:48,087
Fuck!

494
00:30:48,155 --> 00:30:49,922
Don't worry.
Just aim for my finger.

495
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,925
Okay.

496
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:57,664
Just aim for my finger.

497
00:31:08,277 --> 00:31:09,677
You're a fucking bitch.

498
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:10,712
Take it easy, man.

499
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:12,613
Get the fuck out of here.

500
00:31:12,681 --> 00:31:14,650
You owe me a hundred dollars.

501
00:31:17,486 --> 00:31:19,154
You missed that shot on purpose.

502
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:20,556
Probably.

503
00:31:20,623 --> 00:31:23,560
You still owe me
a hundred dollars.

504
00:31:23,627 --> 00:31:25,294
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

505
00:31:25,362 --> 00:31:27,097
You fucking bitch!

506
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,210
Is she here?

507
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:41,445
No, why?

508
00:31:41,513 --> 00:31:43,381
Because it was
not mailed.

509
00:31:43,448 --> 00:31:46,051
Well, she gave me
that before she left.

510
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,888
Oh. Hang around
if you'd like, kiddo.

511
00:31:52,125 --> 00:31:54,559
Okay.

512
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:06,272
What time is it?

513
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,774
About 6:00.

514
00:32:07,841 --> 00:32:09,842
When?

515
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,844
Wednesday afternoon.

516
00:32:16,083 --> 00:32:17,651
What are you looking at?

517
00:32:17,719 --> 00:32:20,020
I'm just checking you out.

518
00:32:21,289 --> 00:32:22,657
I heard you're
not supposed

519
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:24,391
to let someone
hit in the head

520
00:32:24,459 --> 00:32:26,260
sleep for very long,
but every time I try

521
00:32:26,328 --> 00:32:28,330
to wake you up,
you take a swing at me.

522
00:32:28,397 --> 00:32:29,597
So I thought I'd just...

523
00:32:29,665 --> 00:32:32,767
sit here and watch you.

524
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:35,437
To see if I'd just
stop breathing?

525
00:32:41,478 --> 00:32:43,112
Don't need any stitches,
but I'd leave

526
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,115
the bandage on.

527
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:51,221
So what was that
about last night?

528
00:32:52,290 --> 00:32:54,224
I just wanted a game.

529
00:32:54,292 --> 00:32:55,926
You win?
- Yup.

530
00:32:55,994 --> 00:32:57,294
How much?

531
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:00,964
You didn't win shit.

532
00:33:01,032 --> 00:33:02,299
Give me a break.

533
00:33:05,504 --> 00:33:07,071
What's that?

534
00:33:07,139 --> 00:33:09,007
About two thou.

535
00:33:09,074 --> 00:33:12,210
Enough for you
to get out of here and...

536
00:33:12,277 --> 00:33:14,079
catch a little rest.

537
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:16,014
You're a mess.

538
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:18,550
I know I'm a mess.

539
00:33:20,086 --> 00:33:22,821
I got coldcocked
by some dipshit frat boy.

540
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:24,857
I can't hustle a game
to save my life,

541
00:33:24,924 --> 00:33:26,459
I got blood all over my clothes,

542
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:28,328
and I seem to be
throwing up a lot.

543
00:33:28,396 --> 00:33:29,596
I know I'm a mess, Quinn.

544
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:32,365
What's that throwing up about?

545
00:33:32,433 --> 00:33:34,367
Nervous, I guess.

546
00:33:34,435 --> 00:33:36,504
What are you nervous about?

547
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,275
I'm going to get him back.

548
00:33:42,544 --> 00:33:44,912
Kai, you don't even have
visitation rights

549
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,881
let alone custody.

550
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,049
I know.

551
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:49,651
It would be kidnapping.

552
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:50,886
I know.

553
00:33:50,953 --> 00:33:52,286
Eventually,
they'll come looking for you.

554
00:33:52,354 --> 00:33:53,554
Not eventually.

555
00:33:53,622 --> 00:33:55,424
I'll be the first person
they come looking for.

556
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,826
I'm his mother.

557
00:34:00,763 --> 00:34:02,397
And I have a record.

558
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:03,666
You do?

559
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:06,336
Yep.
- What for?

560
00:34:06,403 --> 00:34:08,371
Running a card room.

561
00:34:08,439 --> 00:34:10,239
They put you in jail for that?

562
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:11,474
180 days.

563
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:12,776
Fuck!

564
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,010
Small town.

565
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:16,346
And one bitch came in
and made a huge racket.

566
00:34:16,413 --> 00:34:18,749
Who?

567
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:21,485
Gulley's grandmother, Abigail.

568
00:34:23,321 --> 00:34:24,555
I worked in
a town bar,

569
00:34:24,622 --> 00:34:27,792
and I, uh...
had a card game in back.

570
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,663
One side of town
was a little college

571
00:34:31,731 --> 00:34:33,298
with a bunch of rich kids

572
00:34:33,366 --> 00:34:36,034
who couldn't play for shit,
but they could drink.

573
00:34:36,102 --> 00:34:38,803
And the other side
was a... seminary

574
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:41,507
with a few young men
who could do both,

575
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:43,508
usually pretty well.

576
00:34:45,312 --> 00:34:48,381
Gulley's dad was from
the seminary side.

577
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,050
You were dating a priest?

578
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:52,585
He got kicked out.

579
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:55,889
I got pregnant,

580
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:59,159
and he proposed and...

581
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:02,496
For a couple weeks
it was fantastic.

582
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:07,468
I had this...

583
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:10,171
funny, handsome
19-year-old husband,

584
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:13,875
and I was going to be a mother.

585
00:35:16,145 --> 00:35:20,448
Then a shitstorm named
Abigail rolled in.

586
00:35:20,516 --> 00:35:22,384
Next thing I know,
David disappears,

587
00:35:22,452 --> 00:35:24,853
I get brought up
on a whole load of charges,

588
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,257
and I'm now three months
pregnant.

589
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:34,464
And Abby made me a deal.

590
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:36,566
Give up the baby,
get a divorce,

591
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,538
she'd do whatever she could
to make things easier.

592
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:44,975
I couldn't say no.

593
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:47,411
I mean, I was 25 years old.

594
00:35:47,479 --> 00:35:50,214
I was going to lose the kid
either way.

595
00:35:52,284 --> 00:35:55,921
So while I appreciate the cash,
it isn't going to be enough.

596
00:36:02,596 --> 00:36:04,529
You can't tell me
anymore about this.

597
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,498
I know.

598
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,507
I own the pool hall,

599
00:36:14,575 --> 00:36:16,577
the rent here is cheap.

600
00:36:16,644 --> 00:36:19,379
I'm just too old to start
fucking things up now.

601
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:24,785
Can you help me
set up some games?

602
00:36:24,853 --> 00:36:26,820
How much you need?

603
00:36:26,888 --> 00:36:27,988
I-I don't know yet.

604
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:29,757
I, uh...

605
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:32,560
thinking around $60,000.

606
00:36:32,628 --> 00:36:34,128
Jesus!

607
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:36,097
You going to offer me
a drink, or what?

608
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,243
You can't raise that
by just grabbing games.

609
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,678
Okay.

610
00:36:48,745 --> 00:36:50,012
Did you think
you could?

611
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,847
I hadn't really
thought that far.

612
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:53,850
Ah, crap.

613
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:00,991
What about that guy I you off?

614
00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:02,860
Duncan.

615
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:04,027
Yeah.

616
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:05,395
Maybe him.

617
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:06,898
Okay.
- Yeah.

618
00:37:06,965 --> 00:37:08,232
Maybe.

619
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,636
Listen, I don't want to know
anymore about it.

620
00:37:12,738 --> 00:37:15,340
Okay.

621
00:37:19,011 --> 00:37:21,113
Gulley, come set the table.

622
00:37:21,181 --> 00:37:22,281
Okay.

623
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:23,482
Use the nice napkins.

624
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,783
Your grandma's
coming over.

625
00:37:24,851 --> 00:37:26,752
I know.

626
00:37:28,088 --> 00:37:30,256
I'm coming.

627
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:34,794
Abby hasn't seen you for awhile
so maybe put on a nice shirt.

628
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:36,296
Okay.

629
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:38,498
Remember how I had
to work last weekend?

630
00:37:39,601 --> 00:37:41,201
I don't know.

631
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:43,371
Well, I did
and we couldn't get to mass.

632
00:37:43,438 --> 00:37:44,538
Yeah.

633
00:37:44,606 --> 00:37:47,208
Well, Abby may ask,
and let's just...

634
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:49,377
avoid it, okay?

635
00:37:49,444 --> 00:37:51,412
Sure.

636
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,415
Okay.

637
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:56,751
Go help Ellen.

638
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:58,687
Okay.

639
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,874
Ellen, this is good.

640
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:17,974
What is this?

641
00:38:18,042 --> 00:38:19,175
It's called escarole.

642
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:28,052
How's the world
of real estate?

643
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,488
Busy. People always want
to buy new apartments.

644
00:38:32,123 --> 00:38:34,592
I wouldn't want people coming
and going through my house.

645
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,795
It feels like snooping.

646
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:38,497
I don't go through
their drawers.

647
00:38:38,565 --> 00:38:39,664
You look in their
closets, I bet.

648
00:38:39,732 --> 00:38:41,132
That's not snooping, Mom.

649
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,636
I'm just doing my job.

650
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,875
And school for you, Gulley?

651
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:51,377
It's good.

652
00:38:51,445 --> 00:38:53,180
Good.

653
00:38:56,717 --> 00:38:59,353
He won an English thing the
other day, didn't you, Gulls?

654
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,520
Yeah.

655
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:01,822
Well, I like that school.

656
00:39:01,889 --> 00:39:03,223
It's good, yeah.

657
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,958
How are your catechism classes?

658
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:06,494
They're fine.

659
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:09,062
You work hard there, too.

660
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:13,468
Remember what your grandfather
used to say?

661
00:39:13,535 --> 00:39:16,704
"You got to take the bitter
with the lousy."

662
00:39:19,475 --> 00:39:21,510
Jesus!

663
00:39:21,578 --> 00:39:24,145
What a thing to remember.

664
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:27,649
No.

665
00:39:27,717 --> 00:39:31,353
"Eternity is a hell
of a long time."

666
00:39:31,421 --> 00:39:32,988
Right.

667
00:39:33,056 --> 00:39:35,892
Seriously, Gulley,
apply yourself.

668
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,361
I do.

669
00:39:38,429 --> 00:39:40,463
He could work harder.

670
00:39:44,903 --> 00:39:47,505
How was, uh, late
mass last week?

671
00:39:47,572 --> 00:39:49,040
It was fine.

672
00:39:49,107 --> 00:39:50,374
Who did the early?

673
00:39:50,442 --> 00:39:51,709
Cavanaugh.

674
00:39:51,777 --> 00:39:52,711
Really?

675
00:39:52,779 --> 00:39:54,678
We got Smoltz.

676
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:56,948
Were there guitars?

677
00:39:57,016 --> 00:39:58,350
No.

678
00:39:58,418 --> 00:40:00,618
God, I hate those guitars.

679
00:40:00,686 --> 00:40:03,922
And then they start
singing the Lord's Prayer.

680
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,659
I mean, what in hell do these
people think they're doing?

681
00:40:06,727 --> 00:40:07,859
I don't know.

682
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:11,064
Gulley, remember,

683
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:13,566
just because a thing is new

684
00:40:13,634 --> 00:40:15,134
it doesn't
make it good.

685
00:40:15,202 --> 00:40:16,536
Okay.

686
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:19,640
It makes my skin crawl to hear
that stupid, damn singing.

687
00:40:19,708 --> 00:40:21,475
I know.

688
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:24,878
So let's all go together
to Cavanaugh on Sunday.

689
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:26,580
Okay.

690
00:40:26,648 --> 00:40:29,417
When the three of you
go on your own,

691
00:40:29,485 --> 00:40:32,853
Gulley, do you go by yourself
to get Communion?

692
00:40:32,921 --> 00:40:34,222
Of course.

693
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,324
I'm asking Gulley.

694
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,093
Sure. It's not that hard.

695
00:40:39,195 --> 00:40:40,929
But it's important.

696
00:40:40,996 --> 00:40:43,766
I know.

697
00:40:43,834 --> 00:40:45,467
She's just never
going to let it go.

698
00:40:45,534 --> 00:40:46,801
Snooping? Jesus.

699
00:40:46,869 --> 00:40:49,238
She has, it's just her way.

700
00:40:49,306 --> 00:40:50,473
Well, it ridiculous.

701
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,907
You left the seminary
12 years ago.

702
00:40:51,975 --> 00:40:53,342
Give it a fucking rest.

703
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:54,844
It's not that, Ellen.

704
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:56,813
If there's one thing that
woman adores, it's Gulley,

705
00:40:56,881 --> 00:40:58,448
and he wouldn't even
exist if you...

706
00:40:58,516 --> 00:40:59,648
That's not what it is.

707
00:40:59,716 --> 00:41:01,051
Then what, the divorce?
Yes.

708
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:02,619
It's not a big deal.

709
00:41:02,687 --> 00:41:05,255
It is to her
and to everybody in there.

710
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,023
It's a big deal.

711
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:08,692
Every time she takes Gulley
for Communion,

712
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,762
and I just stay there
in the pew...

713
00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:14,031
it is a big deal, Ellen.

714
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:15,666
I'm standing there with you.

715
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:17,502
No, it's different.

716
00:41:17,569 --> 00:41:21,273
And don't say
he's the only thing she adores.

717
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:25,010
Really, who's next on the list,
her housecleaner?

718
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:42,797
Who are you writing letters to?

719
00:41:42,864 --> 00:41:44,831
What?

720
00:41:44,899 --> 00:41:46,466
I saw a letter
on your desk before.

721
00:41:46,534 --> 00:41:48,035
Who are you writing letters to?

722
00:41:48,103 --> 00:41:49,970
It's not a letter.

723
00:41:50,038 --> 00:41:51,572
Don't lie to me.

724
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,108
So who the hell are you writing
our business to?

725
00:41:54,176 --> 00:41:55,476
"Grandma's coming
for dinner tonight."

726
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:57,546
Uh, "I'm trying to keep
the soap clean."

727
00:41:57,613 --> 00:41:58,846
I mean, what the hell is that?

728
00:41:58,914 --> 00:42:00,549
I said it's not a letter.

729
00:42:00,616 --> 00:42:02,084
Gulley...
- It's not.

730
00:42:02,151 --> 00:42:04,586
Then what is it?

731
00:42:04,654 --> 00:42:06,655
A diary.

732
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:09,926
A diary?

733
00:42:09,993 --> 00:42:11,060
Yeah.

734
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,995
Jesus.

735
00:42:14,063 --> 00:42:17,567
What are you,
a nine-year-old girl?

736
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:48,034
Hello, Gulley.

737
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,135
How's school?

738
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:50,235
It's good.

739
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,405
Here you go.
- Great. Thanks.

740
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:10,892
Well, holy shit,
where have you been?

741
00:43:10,959 --> 00:43:12,859
I got stuck
in the city for a bit.

742
00:43:12,927 --> 00:43:14,228
How was it?

743
00:43:14,296 --> 00:43:15,596
It was good.

744
00:43:15,664 --> 00:43:17,532
How have things been here?

745
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,300
Same ol'.

746
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:20,868
Game tonight?

747
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:22,003
Sure.

748
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:25,074
Probably go easier
on Randolph though.

749
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:26,442
He still pissed?

750
00:43:26,509 --> 00:43:29,044
Just doesn't like
getting rivered is all.

751
00:43:29,112 --> 00:43:30,479
No one does.

752
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:32,515
You want a beer?

753
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:33,683
Uh, yeah.

754
00:43:33,751 --> 00:43:35,517
Yeah, and maybe a whiskey.

755
00:43:35,585 --> 00:43:37,454
You sure you want to
be double-fisting?

756
00:43:37,521 --> 00:43:38,922
You've looked
better, you know.

757
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:40,423
Yeah, I hear that.

758
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:43,426
Hi, Abby. It's Ellen.

759
00:43:43,494 --> 00:43:45,729
Um, you probably aren't
back from mass yet,

760
00:43:45,796 --> 00:43:47,398
but we couldn't make it.

761
00:43:47,466 --> 00:43:49,699
Um, Gulley had
a fever this morning,

762
00:43:49,767 --> 00:43:51,368
so I just put him
back in bed.

763
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:54,472
But, uh, we'll try and swing by
later this afternoon.

764
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,541
Okay? See you soon.

765
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:10,590
Are you feeling
better?

766
00:44:10,657 --> 00:44:11,923
I am, yeah.

767
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:13,860
What was it
you think?

768
00:44:13,927 --> 00:44:16,729
Just a kid thing.

769
00:44:16,797 --> 00:44:18,664
So, not the escarole.

770
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:20,366
No, I don't think so.

771
00:44:20,434 --> 00:44:21,401
Well,

772
00:44:21,468 --> 00:44:23,404
you missed Father Cavanaugh.

773
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:25,406
He was good,

774
00:44:25,473 --> 00:44:27,641
but it was Sunday

775
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:30,978
so he was playing
to the Sunday only.

776
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:35,015
Lots of Galilee
and "fisher of men."

777
00:44:35,083 --> 00:44:39,220
Do you know why Christ
is a fisher of men, Gulley?

778
00:44:39,288 --> 00:44:42,891
'Cause he likes
catching people.

779
00:44:42,958 --> 00:44:44,526
Are you being wise?

780
00:44:44,593 --> 00:44:46,495
No.

781
00:44:46,563 --> 00:44:48,329
I might be wrong
about that school.

782
00:44:48,397 --> 00:44:50,666
David!

783
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:52,068
You have a nosebleed.

784
00:44:52,135 --> 00:44:53,569
He's been getting
these sometimes.

785
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:54,737
Here, hon.

786
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:58,107
Thanks.

787
00:44:58,175 --> 00:45:00,444
Have you been to a doctor
for God's sake?

788
00:45:00,511 --> 00:45:02,446
It's just a bloody nose, Mom.

789
00:45:02,512 --> 00:45:04,181
I'm fine.

790
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:29,608
That was even less than a week.
- I know.

791
00:45:29,676 --> 00:45:31,443
That's better right?
Come on.

792
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:32,945
Got to get
our picture take.

793
00:45:33,012 --> 00:45:34,813
Why?
- 'Cause the only one I have of you

794
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,483
you're like two day old
or something.

795
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:37,584
Okay.

796
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,052
Oh, uh, I wrote down
what I do everyday.

797
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,055
It's pretty
boring.

798
00:45:42,123 --> 00:45:44,057
Thanks, Gulls.
- Sure.

799
00:45:44,125 --> 00:45:46,327
See your grandma
yesterday?

800
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:47,894
Yeah.
How was that?

801
00:45:47,962 --> 00:45:49,930
Okay. It gave me a headache.
- Yeah?

802
00:45:49,998 --> 00:45:52,433
Yeah and dad got
a bloody nose.

803
00:45:52,501 --> 00:45:54,468
How?
- I don't know, it just happened.

804
00:45:54,536 --> 00:45:56,804
You sure your grandma
didn't punch him?

805
00:45:59,609 --> 00:46:01,709
Do I look like that?

806
00:46:01,777 --> 00:46:04,045
Still look
like a lawyer.

807
00:46:04,113 --> 00:46:06,715
Hey, how's
the Paul Revere guy?

808
00:46:06,783 --> 00:46:08,718
It's done.
- You finished it?

809
00:46:08,786 --> 00:46:10,886
No, but we had the test
already.

810
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:12,822
How'd it go?
- I don't know yet.

811
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:14,891
I got Eric Mufti
to tell me how it ended,

812
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,491
so that helped.

813
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:19,028
Well, I can tell this
Mufti guy ain't much of a genius.

814
00:46:19,096 --> 00:46:21,164
Yeah, but he's okay.

815
00:46:21,231 --> 00:46:23,167
Yeah?
- Yeah.

816
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:27,838
I have to ask you
a question.

817
00:46:27,906 --> 00:46:29,840
Okay.

818
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:32,009
It's not really
a fair question.

819
00:46:32,077 --> 00:46:33,677
What do you mean?

820
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:36,114
Uh, I think you're too
young to ask it to.

821
00:46:36,182 --> 00:46:39,116
That's okay.

822
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:42,120
How would you like
to come live with me for a bit?

823
00:46:46,325 --> 00:46:48,593
Uh, it'd be very
different, you know.

824
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:50,096
Lots a, a lot
of changes.

825
00:46:50,163 --> 00:46:51,931
Yeah.
- I mean different school, different city,

826
00:46:51,998 --> 00:46:54,065
all of that.
- I know.

827
00:46:54,134 --> 00:46:56,235
What about missing Eric?

828
00:46:56,303 --> 00:46:59,239
I wouldn't miss him
that much.

829
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,541
What about missing
your dad?

830
00:47:07,515 --> 00:47:09,449
Dad found the letter.

831
00:47:09,517 --> 00:47:10,617
Oh.

832
00:47:10,685 --> 00:47:12,787
But he didn't know
it was to you.

833
00:47:12,855 --> 00:47:14,789
Oh, well, that's
okay then.

834
00:47:14,857 --> 00:47:17,458
Yeah, but still,
he was mad about it

835
00:47:17,526 --> 00:47:20,461
and this is going
to make him really, really mad.

836
00:47:20,529 --> 00:47:22,297
Yeah.

837
00:47:22,365 --> 00:47:23,464
No, I know it will.

838
00:47:23,532 --> 00:47:24,899
And it will make
Abby mad, too,

839
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,067
but you know what?

840
00:47:26,135 --> 00:47:27,536
You won't be around
to see it

841
00:47:27,604 --> 00:47:29,638
so you don't have to
worry about it, okay?

842
00:47:29,706 --> 00:47:31,673
Okay.

843
00:47:31,741 --> 00:47:34,710
Okay-Okay you want
to do it?

844
00:47:34,778 --> 00:47:36,880
Uh-huh.

845
00:47:36,947 --> 00:47:38,580
You gotta make sure

846
00:47:38,648 --> 00:47:40,216
you see Mr. Quinette
every single day, okay.

847
00:47:40,284 --> 00:47:41,551
'Cause we can't
see each other.

848
00:47:41,619 --> 00:47:43,553
Yeah.

849
00:47:45,222 --> 00:47:47,157
And listen...

850
00:47:47,224 --> 00:47:50,161
if we do this,
where we're going,

851
00:47:50,228 --> 00:47:53,596
there might not be any
cotillions or any of that fancy stuff.

852
00:47:53,664 --> 00:47:55,599
Is that going
to be okay?

853
00:47:55,667 --> 00:47:57,601
Yeah.
- Okay.

854
00:47:57,669 --> 00:48:00,204
Try and keep your
nose clean, okay.

855
00:48:10,950 --> 00:48:12,885
How was the trip?
- Good.

856
00:48:12,953 --> 00:48:14,886
Coffee?
- Yeah, please.

857
00:48:14,954 --> 00:48:16,555
Got any money left?

858
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:18,724
I made a couple hundred
in a card game.

859
00:48:18,792 --> 00:48:20,393
Okay!

860
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:23,396
Come on, I got somebody
I want you to meet.

861
00:48:25,833 --> 00:48:27,000
This is Ralph.

862
00:48:27,068 --> 00:48:28,168
Uh...

863
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:29,335
hey, Ralph.

864
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:31,638
I want you

865
00:48:31,706 --> 00:48:33,640
to play him.

866
00:48:33,708 --> 00:48:35,810
Okay, uh, what do you
want to play, Ralph?

867
00:48:37,912 --> 00:48:40,515
One pocket.

868
00:48:40,583 --> 00:48:42,517
$100 a rack.

869
00:49:49,491 --> 00:49:51,424
How you doing?

870
00:49:51,492 --> 00:49:52,926
Good. I'm up.

871
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:54,929
How much?
$600.

872
00:49:54,996 --> 00:49:56,931
Out of how many racks?

873
00:49:58,433 --> 00:50:00,401
14.

874
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,769
I got to say the
kid's good,

875
00:50:01,837 --> 00:50:03,371
but I'm shooting the
lights out of him.

876
00:50:05,474 --> 00:50:07,576
It was nice meeting
you, ma'am.

877
00:50:07,643 --> 00:50:10,078
You're a good shot.

878
00:50:10,146 --> 00:50:12,080
What the fuck was that?

879
00:50:12,148 --> 00:50:14,116
That was an audition.

880
00:50:14,183 --> 00:50:16,119
For him or me?

881
00:50:16,186 --> 00:50:17,553
For him.

882
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:19,288
Remember Billy Victor?

883
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:21,290
California guy.

884
00:50:21,358 --> 00:50:23,459
That's his kid,
Ralphie.

885
00:50:23,527 --> 00:50:26,863
I gave him a grand.

886
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,865
Out of the two
that I offered you.

887
00:50:28,932 --> 00:50:30,100
I told him,

888
00:50:30,168 --> 00:50:33,937
"You lose $600 exactly.

889
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:35,939
"Don't tip your hand

890
00:50:36,007 --> 00:50:38,075
"and get your best game,

891
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:41,246
you can keep the $400."

892
00:50:41,313 --> 00:50:43,347
That kid was laying down?

893
00:50:45,151 --> 00:50:46,284
Bullshit!

894
00:50:46,352 --> 00:50:47,852
There's no way that
kid could beat me.

895
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:49,220
Oh, I don't know
whether he can

896
00:50:49,288 --> 00:50:52,925
or he can't, but I do know
that he can lose to you.

897
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:55,928
And that's better
for us.

898
00:50:55,996 --> 00:50:58,264
Why?
-'Cause you're not going to get this game

899
00:50:58,331 --> 00:51:01,100
for 60 K all by yourself.

900
00:51:01,168 --> 00:51:03,103
You need a stalking horse

901
00:51:03,171 --> 00:51:06,238
and I believe we got him.

902
00:51:06,306 --> 00:51:08,708
Jesus Christ, Quinn, could you
at least give me a head's up

903
00:51:08,776 --> 00:51:10,377
when you're doing
shit like this?

904
00:51:10,445 --> 00:51:11,711
Why?

905
00:51:11,779 --> 00:51:14,181
If he can take
a fall to you,

906
00:51:14,248 --> 00:51:15,749
he can convince
anybody.

907
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:17,752
So give me
my $600 back.

908
00:51:19,353 --> 00:51:21,322
Oh, listen to me,

909
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:24,325
there's no way he could
take you straight up.

910
00:51:24,393 --> 00:51:27,929
Controlled losing
is not winning.

911
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:32,701
Hey, see that guy
over there.

912
00:51:32,769 --> 00:51:33,868
Is that guy lurking around
for you?

913
00:51:33,936 --> 00:51:35,270
Yeah.

914
00:51:35,338 --> 00:51:36,905
He's clearly not here
for the pool.

915
00:51:36,973 --> 00:51:37,940
He's just

916
00:51:38,007 --> 00:51:39,542
drawing attention
to himself.

917
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,410
Would you get him
the hell out of here?

918
00:51:41,478 --> 00:51:43,413
Yeah.

919
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:49,519
This is a ridiculous game.

920
00:51:49,587 --> 00:51:51,588
'Cause you suck at it.
- Yeah, I do, I know.

921
00:51:51,655 --> 00:51:53,457
But I mean, it doesn't
even have the appeal

922
00:51:53,525 --> 00:51:54,925
to try to get
better for it.

923
00:51:54,993 --> 00:51:57,194
I mean, it's just,
it's irritating.

924
00:51:57,262 --> 00:51:58,863
That's 'cause
you suck at it.

925
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,865
Come on.

926
00:52:04,002 --> 00:52:05,970
<i>Don't get too excited.</i>

927
00:52:06,037 --> 00:52:07,506
It's just the photos.

928
00:52:07,573 --> 00:52:08,673
Okay.

929
00:52:08,741 --> 00:52:10,007
I'll have
the money soon.

930
00:52:10,075 --> 00:52:11,343
I'm not worried,
uh, you know.

931
00:52:11,410 --> 00:52:12,978
They'll be ready in
a couple of days.

932
00:52:13,045 --> 00:52:14,980
Come here.

933
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:18,417
What?
- Look, I need you to do something,

934
00:52:18,484 --> 00:52:20,420
besides get me
my money.

935
00:52:20,487 --> 00:52:23,589
I want you to figure out
where you're going to cross.

936
00:52:23,657 --> 00:52:24,824
What do you mean?

937
00:52:24,892 --> 00:52:26,692
Well, these are going
to be good.

938
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,961
They're going to be as good
as anything you've ever seen.

939
00:52:29,029 --> 00:52:31,365
But, since you've got a kid,

940
00:52:31,433 --> 00:52:33,032
you try to go through
a major airport,

941
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:34,868
like, uh, Toronto
or Vancouver,

942
00:52:34,936 --> 00:52:36,103
you're just asking

943
00:52:36,171 --> 00:52:38,005
for trouble.
- We're driving.

944
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:39,673
Yeah, but still, um...

945
00:52:39,741 --> 00:52:42,676
like Niagara Falls,
still stupid.

946
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,679
Okay.
- Okay.

947
00:52:44,747 --> 00:52:46,581
Uh, you taking your own car?

948
00:52:46,649 --> 00:52:48,583
No, no, I won it
in a card game.

949
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:50,151
But the guy keeps
holding the paper

950
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:51,553
thinking he can
get it back.

951
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:53,189
That's a dumb guy.

952
00:52:53,256 --> 00:52:54,222
Hey, uh...

953
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,623
Markus...

954
00:52:55,691 --> 00:52:57,726
What? What?
- I need one more thing.

955
00:52:57,794 --> 00:52:59,028
A gun.

956
00:52:59,096 --> 00:53:01,864
Look,

957
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:05,468
that's not the kind of thing you
say in just like a talky voice.

958
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:07,070
Doesn't have to work.

959
00:53:07,138 --> 00:53:08,572
In fact, I don't
even need bullets.

960
00:53:08,639 --> 00:53:10,005
But it should look good.
- No.

961
00:53:10,073 --> 00:53:12,209
There's reason in the world
you need a pretend gun.

962
00:53:12,276 --> 00:53:14,244
You either need a real one
or you don't.

963
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:17,180
No, I need a real looking
pretend one.

964
00:54:02,631 --> 00:54:04,565
Hey, Quinn!

965
00:54:05,635 --> 00:54:07,902
Quinn, get up!

966
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:10,739
I got breakfast.

967
00:54:10,807 --> 00:54:12,574
Quinn!

968
00:54:12,642 --> 00:54:14,911
...I don't eat
breakfast!

969
00:54:14,978 --> 00:54:16,912
Go away!

970
00:54:16,979 --> 00:54:18,580
Oh, for God's sakes.

971
00:54:18,648 --> 00:54:20,917
You have to... oh.
Kailey, don't!

972
00:54:20,984 --> 00:54:23,218
Oh...
- Sorry.

973
00:54:37,601 --> 00:54:39,269
Uh...

974
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:40,337
sorry again.

975
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:41,505
You're making
my retirement

976
00:54:41,573 --> 00:54:44,342
difficult in many, many ways.

977
00:54:44,410 --> 00:54:45,375
It just...

978
00:54:45,443 --> 00:54:46,978
What?

979
00:54:49,081 --> 00:54:52,017
I don't know, it just...

980
00:54:52,085 --> 00:54:54,185
sorry.

981
00:54:54,253 --> 00:54:57,189
Why the early morning
enthusiasm?

982
00:54:57,257 --> 00:54:59,225
Here.

983
00:54:59,292 --> 00:55:01,293
What's this?

984
00:55:01,361 --> 00:55:03,662
Just some things to remember
when people come asking.

985
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,897
People?

986
00:55:04,965 --> 00:55:06,366
Police people?

987
00:55:06,434 --> 00:55:08,033
Probably.

988
00:55:08,101 --> 00:55:10,036
Okay.

989
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:16,176
"She slept on top of
the table for a few days,

990
00:55:16,244 --> 00:55:18,245
"and then
was gone.

991
00:55:18,312 --> 00:55:21,082
She played
lots of pool."

992
00:55:21,150 --> 00:55:24,252
You could have slipped this
under the door.

993
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,520
I already said I'm sorry.

994
00:55:25,587 --> 00:55:27,722
Okay.

995
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:31,926
I need to set up the game soon.

996
00:55:31,994 --> 00:55:34,563
Well, all we
can do is try.

997
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:44,606
Duncan plays this...
this guy Mike Simms every week,

998
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:47,644
and he beats him every week,
without fail.

999
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,045
First step,

1000
00:55:49,113 --> 00:55:52,549
we got to get rid of
this degenerate Simms,

1001
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,451
and get
Duncan to play

1002
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:55,953
Ralphie Victor, and if

1003
00:55:56,021 --> 00:55:58,555
Ralphie does his job
the way we know he can,

1004
00:55:58,622 --> 00:56:00,925
Duncan should have a
good taste in his mouth

1005
00:56:00,992 --> 00:56:02,893
when you come around.

1006
00:56:02,961 --> 00:56:05,464
Okay. I'll get Markus
to distract Simms for us.

1007
00:56:05,531 --> 00:56:07,031
Yeah, but you got

1008
00:56:07,098 --> 00:56:08,766
to keep your eye
on me, because...

1009
00:56:08,834 --> 00:56:10,902
if you don't play
him just right,

1010
00:56:10,970 --> 00:56:13,637
he'll slip the hook.

1011
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,707
Okay. There's more
on the back. The letter.

1012
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:16,875
On-On the back.

1013
00:56:28,555 --> 00:56:30,256
"Don't lie for me.

1014
00:56:30,324 --> 00:56:32,626
At all."

1015
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:34,628
You got it.

1016
00:56:36,663 --> 00:56:38,565
It's not a sex thing.
- Yes, it is.

1017
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:39,967
It's not. I asked.

1018
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:41,803
It is. Your mother
wanted an abortion.

1019
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:43,003
It's not that.

1020
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:44,605
It's like an annuls.

1021
00:56:44,672 --> 00:56:46,674
It's the same thing.
It's not.

1022
00:56:46,742 --> 00:56:48,777
It's like a divorce,
but for the church.

1023
00:56:48,844 --> 00:56:50,077
A divorce from God?

1024
00:56:50,145 --> 00:56:51,513
I guess.
- That's even worse then.

1025
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,414
Shut up, and she
didn't even get it.

1026
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:54,249
But she wanted to.
- Shut up!

1027
00:57:53,914 --> 00:57:56,150
Nice games.

1028
00:57:56,218 --> 00:57:58,151
No more?

1029
00:57:58,219 --> 00:58:00,154
No.

1030
00:58:05,227 --> 00:58:06,327
You want to play again?

1031
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:09,431
Come on.

1032
00:58:09,499 --> 00:58:10,532
I'll give you the ball

1033
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,999
I offered you before.

1034
00:58:12,067 --> 00:58:13,400
No.

1035
00:58:13,468 --> 00:58:14,903
I'll give you two balls.

1036
00:58:14,971 --> 00:58:17,072
What were we
playing before?

1037
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:18,573
A hundred a rack.

1038
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,709
Okay.

1039
00:58:20,777 --> 00:58:22,712
Why don't we do five a rack,

1040
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:24,714
and I'll still take the weight.

1041
00:58:25,816 --> 00:58:28,084
Okay.

1042
00:58:28,152 --> 00:58:30,953
But I'm not going
to give you the first break.

1043
00:58:31,021 --> 00:58:33,389
So we'll lag.

1044
00:58:43,468 --> 00:58:45,402
Nice.

1045
01:00:26,546 --> 01:00:28,481
We got to play
straight up.

1046
01:00:28,549 --> 01:00:29,982
No more giving you weight.

1047
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:32,552
Okay. Let's go a
thousand a rack.

1048
01:00:32,619 --> 01:00:34,554
Sure.

1049
01:00:34,621 --> 01:00:36,390
This can't be
a cash game anymore.

1050
01:00:39,326 --> 01:00:41,261
Hey,

1051
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:43,997
go down and lock the door.

1052
01:00:58,481 --> 01:01:00,449
I thought you might like this.

1053
01:01:00,517 --> 01:01:01,916
What is it?

1054
01:01:01,984 --> 01:01:05,054
It's a book of poems
by Sherwood Anderson.

1055
01:01:05,121 --> 01:01:07,990
He was a poet, but he worked
in advertising first.

1056
01:01:08,058 --> 01:01:09,725
Oh.

1057
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:13,163
I just... I thought
you might like it.

1058
01:02:32,683 --> 01:02:35,152
That it?

1059
01:02:35,220 --> 01:02:37,954
How much am I down?

1060
01:02:38,021 --> 01:02:39,388
How much am I down?

1061
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,858
7500.

1062
01:02:40,925 --> 01:02:43,527
That's a lot.

1063
01:02:45,296 --> 01:02:48,265
You should quit.

1064
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:57,008
I'll play you
for $10,000 a rack,

1065
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:59,244
but I need a break first.

1066
01:02:59,311 --> 01:03:01,346
I'll be back in an hour or so.

1067
01:03:01,413 --> 01:03:03,349
You be here?

1068
01:03:03,416 --> 01:03:05,184
I'll be here.

1069
01:03:05,252 --> 01:03:07,953
It's back to being a cash game
from now on.

1070
01:03:08,021 --> 01:03:09,722
Okay.

1071
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:15,494
Okay.

1072
01:03:17,598 --> 01:03:19,132
Here. Give him
one of these.

1073
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,300
No, no.

1074
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:22,135
Come on, eat it.
You'll need it.

1075
01:03:22,203 --> 01:03:24,237
And try to get a
rest, will you?

1076
01:03:24,305 --> 01:03:25,572
Just stretch
out right here.

1077
01:03:25,641 --> 01:03:26,874
What about you?

1078
01:03:26,942 --> 01:03:28,308
Well, I'm fine.

1079
01:03:28,376 --> 01:03:31,179
I chewed most the enamel
off my teeth, but I'm fine.

1080
01:03:31,246 --> 01:03:32,513
What have you
got there?

1081
01:03:32,581 --> 01:03:33,915
11, five.

1082
01:03:33,982 --> 01:03:38,052
Okay. Plus,
that's seven, five he owes.

1083
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,055
This is, uh...

1084
01:03:42,392 --> 01:03:45,727
...25, 600 something.

1085
01:03:45,795 --> 01:03:48,865
Shit.

1086
01:03:48,933 --> 01:03:50,732
Lose two in a row,
we're through.

1087
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:52,067
What if he doesn't come back?

1088
01:03:52,135 --> 01:03:53,369
Oh, he's coming back.

1089
01:03:53,437 --> 01:03:55,305
How do you know?
- Because he wants

1090
01:03:55,372 --> 01:03:57,273
to beat your brains in,
that's why.

1091
01:03:57,341 --> 01:03:59,576
It's almost 5:00
in the morning.

1092
01:03:59,643 --> 01:04:02,646
Now, listen, you
don't need to win

1093
01:04:02,714 --> 01:04:04,014
six games.

1094
01:04:04,082 --> 01:04:06,249
Win four.

1095
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:09,954
I'll make the
rest up in bets.

1096
01:04:10,021 --> 01:04:11,088
And don't be surprised

1097
01:04:11,156 --> 01:04:13,290
if he don't try
to fuck with you.

1098
01:04:13,358 --> 01:04:15,893
Like how?
- I don't know,

1099
01:04:15,961 --> 01:04:20,598
but he'll do something to try
to knock you off your rhythm.

1100
01:04:40,889 --> 01:04:41,988
Ten grand a rack.

1101
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:43,156
Yup.

1102
01:04:43,223 --> 01:04:44,324
Cash.

1103
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:45,459
Quinn's got mine.

1104
01:04:45,527 --> 01:04:46,793
And Quinn's
friend has mine.

1105
01:04:50,865 --> 01:04:52,799
Your dad would be sick.

1106
01:04:55,371 --> 01:04:56,770
And we're playing
nine ball.

1107
01:04:56,838 --> 01:04:58,306
Raise to seven.

1108
01:04:58,374 --> 01:05:00,575
What happened to one pocket?

1109
01:05:00,643 --> 01:05:03,379
It went away. Problem?

1110
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:09,952
No problem.

1111
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:15,291
What?

1112
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:18,528
Just seems a chumpy game for us.

1113
01:05:22,466 --> 01:05:24,401
You want to quit me?

1114
01:05:27,205 --> 01:05:29,139
No, I'll play you.

1115
01:05:30,576 --> 01:05:32,510
Just think
it's beneath us is all.

1116
01:05:35,547 --> 01:05:38,817
Well... I'll learn
to live with it.

1117
01:05:39,919 --> 01:05:41,853
Lag for the break.

1118
01:06:07,449 --> 01:06:10,017
Nobody's going
to bet on this.

1119
01:06:10,085 --> 01:06:11,652
This is his game.

1120
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:13,687
You'll be lucky
to sink even one nine ball.

1121
01:06:13,755 --> 01:06:15,322
Fuck off, will you?

1122
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,902
I need a minute.

1123
01:08:29,970 --> 01:08:31,236
No way.

1124
01:08:31,304 --> 01:08:32,571
I need a minute.
- No!

1125
01:08:32,638 --> 01:08:33,873
Then it's a forfeit.

1126
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:34,874
The hell you say!

1127
01:08:34,942 --> 01:08:36,175
You took a three-hour break
earlier!

1128
01:08:36,243 --> 01:08:38,878
That wasn't in the middle
of a fucking game.

1129
01:08:38,946 --> 01:08:41,681
She can take a
break at the end.

1130
01:08:41,748 --> 01:08:43,383
She wants a break now,
it's a forfeit.

1131
01:08:43,451 --> 01:08:45,051
All right.

1132
01:08:45,118 --> 01:08:46,052
You guys, move.

1133
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:48,856
You okay?

1134
01:08:48,923 --> 01:08:49,857
Yeah.

1135
01:08:49,924 --> 01:08:51,659
You sure?
- Yeah.

1136
01:08:53,161 --> 01:08:56,029
Okay.

1137
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,736
And this isn't the middle
of the fucking game.

1138
01:09:37,743 --> 01:09:38,876
Who did that?

1139
01:09:38,944 --> 01:09:39,977
It's okay.

1140
01:09:40,045 --> 01:09:40,978
Your dad do that?

1141
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:43,015
No, just a kid at school.

1142
01:09:43,082 --> 01:09:44,649
That Muftie kid?

1143
01:09:44,716 --> 01:09:45,683
Yeah.

1144
01:09:45,751 --> 01:09:47,920
I told you that
kid was bad news.

1145
01:09:47,987 --> 01:09:49,922
Yeah, but you were great.

1146
01:09:49,989 --> 01:09:51,156
Yeah?

1147
01:09:52,258 --> 01:09:55,527
Well... it worked out.

1148
01:09:55,595 --> 01:09:56,763
All right, get out of here.

1149
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,598
Okay?

1150
01:09:58,665 --> 01:09:59,831
Hey, uh, Gulls.

1151
01:09:59,899 --> 01:10:03,036
Uh, tomorrow, when
you leave for school,

1152
01:10:03,103 --> 01:10:05,339
uh, pack some extra clothes
in your backpack, okay?

1153
01:10:05,407 --> 01:10:09,008
And find some excuse to get
what's-her-face to walk you

1154
01:10:09,076 --> 01:10:11,612
and leave the apartment
door unlocked.

1155
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,613
Okay.

1156
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:14,748
Oh, and meet me here.

1157
01:10:33,537 --> 01:10:36,338
That should do you and give
you a little something extra.

1158
01:10:36,405 --> 01:10:39,041
You reimburse yourself
a thousand?

1159
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:40,977
It was $400.

1160
01:10:41,044 --> 01:10:43,646
You're going to need
all you can get.

1161
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,518
You should take it.

1162
01:10:47,585 --> 01:10:50,220
Nah.

1163
01:11:14,147 --> 01:11:16,081
Hey.

1164
01:11:18,753 --> 01:11:19,985
What are you doing?

1165
01:11:20,053 --> 01:11:21,720
I just want
the broth.

1166
01:11:21,788 --> 01:11:22,988
Okay.

1167
01:11:23,057 --> 01:11:25,325
It's all in here.

1168
01:11:25,393 --> 01:11:27,526
Thanks.

1169
01:11:27,594 --> 01:11:29,396
There you go.

1170
01:11:29,463 --> 01:11:30,397
All right, look.

1171
01:11:30,464 --> 01:11:32,300
I took you at your word.

1172
01:11:32,367 --> 01:11:34,968
It's a fake gun,
but it looks real,

1173
01:11:35,036 --> 01:11:37,305
and if you put bullets
in it,

1174
01:11:37,372 --> 01:11:40,341
it's going to blow up
in your face.

1175
01:11:40,409 --> 01:11:41,510
Thanks.

1176
01:11:41,578 --> 01:11:43,377
And do me a favor, will you?
What's that?

1177
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:46,982
When you get there,
just, uh, you know,

1178
01:11:47,050 --> 01:11:50,418
send me a postcard
of a pool table or something

1179
01:11:50,485 --> 01:11:52,421
just to tell me
that you made it safe.

1180
01:11:53,489 --> 01:11:54,857
Thanks, Markus.

1181
01:12:00,364 --> 01:12:02,298
Okay.

1182
01:12:02,366 --> 01:12:03,299
Take care.

1183
01:12:05,903 --> 01:12:08,738
It's locked, it's locked.

1184
01:12:16,047 --> 01:12:18,883
David.

1185
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:21,752
David?

1186
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:23,488
David.

1187
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:24,756
David.

1188
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,929
Kai?

1189
01:12:33,432 --> 01:12:34,466
What are you doing here?

1190
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:37,637
I was in town,
thought I'd say hi.

1191
01:12:37,704 --> 01:12:39,539
How'd you get in?

1192
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:40,972
Door was open.

1193
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,608
You have to buzz.

1194
01:12:42,676 --> 01:12:44,610
Just followed
somebody in.

1195
01:12:44,678 --> 01:12:45,746
Where's Gulley?

1196
01:12:47,849 --> 01:12:50,717
He's at school.

1197
01:12:52,754 --> 01:12:53,754
Jesus.

1198
01:12:56,524 --> 01:12:58,525
What are you doing here, Rings?

1199
01:13:01,664 --> 01:13:03,597
Don't call me that.

1200
01:13:03,665 --> 01:13:06,000
Sorry.

1201
01:13:06,068 --> 01:13:08,737
So what are
you doing here?

1202
01:13:08,805 --> 01:13:10,172
Told you,
I was just in town.

1203
01:13:10,240 --> 01:13:11,239
Here,
brought you a coffee.

1204
01:13:11,307 --> 01:13:12,240
You what?

1205
01:13:12,308 --> 01:13:13,842
A coffee.

1206
01:13:18,348 --> 01:13:20,382
Look at you.

1207
01:13:20,450 --> 01:13:21,517
All grown up.

1208
01:13:24,822 --> 01:13:26,755
You want to know
what I've been up to?

1209
01:13:26,823 --> 01:13:29,759
What, like, the last, I don't
know, 11 years have been like?

1210
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:30,760
No.

1211
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:33,063
Yeah, you do.

1212
01:13:33,130 --> 01:13:37,435
How's Abby?

1213
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:40,303
Well, give her my best.

1214
01:13:43,342 --> 01:13:45,944
He's been writing
to you, hasn't he?

1215
01:13:46,012 --> 01:13:47,812
Those letters
were, were to you?

1216
01:13:49,481 --> 01:13:50,415
That lying brat.

1217
01:13:50,483 --> 01:13:51,850
David,
do me a favor.

1218
01:13:51,918 --> 01:13:54,586
C-Can we just,
just sit here for a sec?

1219
01:13:54,654 --> 01:13:56,655
Please.

1220
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:00,994
He wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

1221
01:14:01,061 --> 01:14:02,261
Yeah?

1222
01:14:02,328 --> 01:14:03,262
Like what?

1223
01:14:03,329 --> 01:14:05,064
Well... for one,

1224
01:14:05,132 --> 01:14:07,901
you're making him take dancing
lessons, for God's sakes.

1225
01:14:07,968 --> 01:14:09,302
Give me a break.

1226
01:14:09,370 --> 01:14:11,371
And how he has to lie
about going to church

1227
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:13,240
and how he gets
into fights.

1228
01:14:13,308 --> 01:14:14,508
Every kid gets
into fights.

1229
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:15,609
Yeah.

1230
01:14:15,677 --> 01:14:18,612
Not every kid has
to lie for his dad.

1231
01:14:20,515 --> 01:14:22,617
How'd he break his hand?

1232
01:14:22,685 --> 01:14:24,585
He fell down.
- How?

1233
01:14:24,653 --> 01:14:27,122
Kids fall down-- enough
with the fucking grilling.

1234
01:14:27,189 --> 01:14:28,123
Seriously,
David,

1235
01:14:28,191 --> 01:14:29,724
I need you to stay in bed.

1236
01:14:29,792 --> 01:14:31,159
Shut up, Rings, okay?

1237
01:14:31,228 --> 01:14:32,394
Where the fuck is my watch?

1238
01:14:32,461 --> 01:14:33,395
David.

1239
01:14:34,497 --> 01:14:36,866
I need you to stay in bed

1240
01:14:36,934 --> 01:14:41,704
and don't call me Rings
even one more goddamn time!

1241
01:14:41,772 --> 01:14:42,772
Lay back down.

1242
01:14:42,839 --> 01:14:46,242
Lay back down.

1243
01:14:47,311 --> 01:14:48,311
What are you doing?

1244
01:14:48,378 --> 01:14:50,647
I'm taking him with me.

1245
01:14:50,715 --> 01:14:51,648
Well, he's
not here.

1246
01:14:51,716 --> 01:14:52,649
I know.

1247
01:14:52,717 --> 01:14:53,983
Oh, Jesus.

1248
01:14:54,051 --> 01:14:57,421
Now, tell me,
how did he fall down?

1249
01:14:59,525 --> 01:15:02,059
We just bumped
into each other.

1250
01:15:08,234 --> 01:15:10,702
Like I said... he wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

1251
01:15:10,769 --> 01:15:11,970
What do you think
you're doing, Kailey?

1252
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:13,038
How Abby is the same.

1253
01:15:13,106 --> 01:15:16,074
You know the one thing
I'm gonna miss

1254
01:15:16,141 --> 01:15:18,177
is not being able
to tell her what a true

1255
01:15:18,245 --> 01:15:20,179
and hateful bitch...

1256
01:15:20,247 --> 01:15:22,182
Ow!

1257
01:15:24,484 --> 01:15:26,419
Fuck you.
- Like I said,

1258
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,555
he wrote me
about a lot of stuff.

1259
01:15:28,623 --> 01:15:33,260
But the thing in his letters
that's the clearest

1260
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:34,594
is what he never says.

1261
01:15:34,662 --> 01:15:35,763
Yeah, what's that?

1262
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:38,765
He's scared of you.

1263
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:41,736
'Cause you're angry all the
time and he doesn't know why.

1264
01:15:41,803 --> 01:15:43,337
And so you're taking him?

1265
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,506
Right.
So why are you telling me?

1266
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:48,175
You could have just taken
him without all this.

1267
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:49,878
'Cause I want you to know
he's going to be okay.

1268
01:15:49,946 --> 01:15:51,313
You're pointing
a gun at me.

1269
01:15:51,381 --> 01:15:52,713
Doesn't inspire
confidence.

1270
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,151
He's going to be fine.

1271
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:57,786
He's going to be better.

1272
01:15:57,854 --> 01:16:00,856
He might actually have a couple
of fucking friends.

1273
01:16:00,924 --> 01:16:03,259
You can get up now.

1274
01:16:11,535 --> 01:16:12,937
Hey, Rings?

1275
01:16:13,004 --> 01:16:14,571
You don't want to be
doing this, Rings!

1276
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,541
It's why you're sick.

1277
01:16:18,643 --> 01:16:20,644
You know
it's wrong.

1278
01:16:20,712 --> 01:16:22,646
Ow!

1279
01:16:22,714 --> 01:16:24,315
God!

1280
01:16:24,382 --> 01:16:25,950
I told you to stop
calling me that.

1281
01:16:26,018 --> 01:16:28,954
Find yourself a little
nickname for Ellen.

1282
01:16:29,021 --> 01:16:29,954
I don't have one.

1283
01:16:30,021 --> 01:16:31,122
I know.

1284
01:16:31,190 --> 01:16:32,557
I don't know when
she'll be back.

1285
01:16:32,625 --> 01:16:34,626
Hopefully, she'll have a nice,
long breakfast somewhere

1286
01:16:34,694 --> 01:16:36,162
and linger a bit,

1287
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:40,266
but until then...
just think about how I'm right.

1288
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:42,168
He can't be
here anymore.

1289
01:16:42,236 --> 01:16:43,903
Something bad
will happen.

1290
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:46,572
Abby will push harder,
you'll drink more,

1291
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:49,543
something else will get broken.

1292
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:55,449
Just...

1293
01:16:55,516 --> 01:16:58,085
just give me a chance.

1294
01:16:58,153 --> 01:16:59,620
Okay? I'll take
care of him.

1295
01:16:59,687 --> 01:17:01,622
Rings,
you don't

1296
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:02,623
want to do this.

1297
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:04,893
Rings.

1298
01:17:07,997 --> 01:17:10,198
If you feel like you have
to call the police,

1299
01:17:10,266 --> 01:17:13,135
just wait as long as you can.

1300
01:17:36,093 --> 01:17:37,193
You drive a truck?

1301
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:38,962
That's great.

1302
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:40,731
Come on, Gulls.

1303
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:42,733
We've got to go.

1304
01:17:46,138 --> 01:17:48,640
But why do this to you?

1305
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:50,975
She wanted me to know
that he'd be okay.

1306
01:17:51,043 --> 01:17:52,510
What?

1307
01:17:52,578 --> 01:17:53,912
She said...

1308
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:57,649
he'd be better off
with her than with us.

1309
01:18:00,453 --> 01:18:03,256
Is she right?

1310
01:18:05,892 --> 01:18:10,029
David? Is she right?

1311
01:18:12,300 --> 01:18:14,300
Call the police.

1312
01:18:18,907 --> 01:18:21,242
Is there anything
I can do to help?

1313
01:18:21,309 --> 01:18:22,743
Nope.

1314
01:18:22,811 --> 01:18:24,245
Stay strapped in.

1315
01:18:24,312 --> 01:18:26,681
Okay.

1316
01:18:26,749 --> 01:18:29,650
I could help you drive.

1317
01:18:29,718 --> 01:18:31,620
You know how to
drive standard?

1318
01:18:31,687 --> 01:18:33,321
Yeah.

1319
01:18:33,389 --> 01:18:35,557
No, you don't.

1320
01:18:37,493 --> 01:18:38,760
Did you pack any
other clothes?

1321
01:18:38,828 --> 01:18:40,529
Some, yeah,
but they're in the back.

1322
01:18:40,597 --> 01:18:42,497
Okay, well, uh,
stay buckled in,

1323
01:18:42,565 --> 01:18:45,234
but lose the lawyer
outfit, will you?

1324
01:18:45,302 --> 01:18:47,236
Sure.

1325
01:18:50,841 --> 01:18:51,974
No, you're not listening--

1326
01:18:52,042 --> 01:18:53,644
she doesn't have
visitation rights.

1327
01:18:53,711 --> 01:18:55,846
Nobody's seen
that woman in 11 years.

1328
01:18:55,914 --> 01:18:58,081
Not even your grandson?

1329
01:18:58,149 --> 01:18:59,383
Absolutely not him.

1330
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:01,418
She hasn't seen him
since he was born.

1331
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:02,754
Where was that?

1332
01:19:02,821 --> 01:19:04,922
Ohio, near Columbus.

1333
01:19:06,024 --> 01:19:09,160
Where was that town?

1334
01:19:09,228 --> 01:19:11,095
David?

1335
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:15,700
They may have been
writing each other.

1336
01:19:15,768 --> 01:19:17,603
Oh, for Christ sake, David!

1337
01:19:17,671 --> 01:19:19,571
I only just found out.

1338
01:19:19,638 --> 01:19:21,006
How?

1339
01:19:21,074 --> 01:19:22,341
What do you mean?

1340
01:19:22,409 --> 01:19:23,976
You said you don't
know where she was,

1341
01:19:24,044 --> 01:19:25,612
so how's your son
going to write her?

1342
01:19:26,713 --> 01:19:28,781
I-I don't know.

1343
01:19:28,848 --> 01:19:29,950
Okay.

1344
01:19:30,017 --> 01:19:31,117
Anything else?

1345
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:33,320
She has a gun.

1346
01:19:33,487 --> 01:19:35,889
You keep telling us that.

1347
01:19:35,957 --> 01:19:37,893
At least let me shift.

1348
01:19:38,861 --> 01:19:40,461
No.

1349
01:19:41,029 --> 01:19:42,529
I'll roshambo you for it.

1350
01:19:42,597 --> 01:19:43,698
You'll what?

1351
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:45,900
Rock, paper, scissors?

1352
01:19:45,968 --> 01:19:48,469
Oh, for God sakes.

1353
01:19:48,537 --> 01:19:50,338
All right, fine.

1354
01:19:50,405 --> 01:19:53,208
I'm going to throw a rock.

1355
01:19:53,276 --> 01:19:54,910
Really?

1356
01:19:54,978 --> 01:19:56,911
Promise.

1357
01:19:56,979 --> 01:19:59,248
Okay. On four, all right?

1358
01:19:59,316 --> 01:20:02,552
Okay, one, two, three.

1359
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:04,419
I lied.

1360
01:20:04,487 --> 01:20:06,054
Oh!
- Now teach me.

1361
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:10,994
Okay, up and towards
me is first.

1362
01:20:11,061 --> 01:20:12,428
Down is second.

1363
01:20:12,496 --> 01:20:13,863
Up and towards
you is third.

1364
01:20:13,931 --> 01:20:14,998
Down is fourth.

1365
01:20:15,065 --> 01:20:16,300
Okay, that's pretty much it.

1366
01:20:16,368 --> 01:20:18,635
But you gotta do it
when I push in the clutch,

1367
01:20:18,702 --> 01:20:21,005
otherwise it's going to make
a terrible noise and we crash.

1368
01:20:21,072 --> 01:20:22,006
Okay?
Okay.

1369
01:20:22,073 --> 01:20:23,741
First.

1370
01:20:25,744 --> 01:20:27,478
Second.

1371
01:20:29,916 --> 01:20:31,783
Third.

1372
01:20:33,318 --> 01:20:35,220
That's fourth.

1373
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:37,055
I can't believe
you cheated.

1374
01:20:45,532 --> 01:20:47,299
No letters.

1375
01:20:47,366 --> 01:20:48,601
All of it's
schoolwork.

1376
01:20:51,538 --> 01:20:53,473
I looked through
those already.

1377
01:21:06,589 --> 01:21:09,090
Where the hell is
Chasm Falls, New York?

1378
01:21:09,158 --> 01:21:10,490
We'll find out.

1379
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,427
But Quinn's Billiards
should be pretty easy.

1380
01:21:15,097 --> 01:21:17,098
Goddamn it.

1381
01:21:31,514 --> 01:21:33,817
You know some woman
named Kailey Sullivan?

1382
01:21:33,884 --> 01:21:34,951
Oh, fuck.

1383
01:21:35,019 --> 01:21:36,186
Did she wreck my truck?

1384
01:21:36,254 --> 01:21:39,256
Why would she wreck your truck?

1385
01:21:39,323 --> 01:21:40,924
Because she thinks it's hers.

1386
01:21:40,992 --> 01:21:44,629
Excuse me.
You Mr. Quinette?

1387
01:21:51,803 --> 01:21:53,905
Hey, Gulls.

1388
01:21:53,972 --> 01:21:55,873
You try to get
some sleep, okay?

1389
01:21:55,941 --> 01:21:57,409
We've still got a ways.

1390
01:21:57,477 --> 01:21:59,611
No, I'm okay.

1391
01:22:05,518 --> 01:22:09,288
What do you think Dad's
doing right now?

1392
01:22:09,355 --> 01:22:12,825
I think he's
worried about you.

1393
01:22:14,963 --> 01:22:19,332
I just hope he
isn't mean to Ellen.

1394
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:22,836
You want to write
him a letter?

1395
01:22:22,904 --> 01:22:26,106
No. Maybe some time
but not right now.

1396
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:28,008
Why not?

1397
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:30,145
It would just make
him even madder.

1398
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:34,549
Well, we'll write
him a letter

1399
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:37,485
whenever
you want, okay?

1400
01:22:37,553 --> 01:22:39,554
Go to sleep, Gulls.

1401
01:23:04,415 --> 01:23:05,883
How far is Canada?
It's not far.

1402
01:23:05,951 --> 01:23:08,585
Probably about 20
miles up there.

1403
01:23:08,653 --> 01:23:10,989
We've got to catch a bus.

1404
01:23:11,056 --> 01:23:13,057
Let's just drive.

1405
01:23:13,125 --> 01:23:14,392
We can't.

1406
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,227
Hey, Gulls, listen.

1407
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:20,132
On the bus, if anyone asks,
you're a very sick kid.

1408
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,600
Like a cold?

1409
01:23:22,668 --> 01:23:25,170
No, maybe even
worse than that.

1410
01:23:25,238 --> 01:23:26,772
Escarole poisoning?

1411
01:23:26,840 --> 01:23:28,007
What is that?

1412
01:23:28,074 --> 01:23:30,676
I guess like food poisoning.

1413
01:23:30,744 --> 01:23:34,114
No. Uh, worse than that.

1414
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,774
I've got to get my bag first.

1415
01:24:04,781 --> 01:24:06,648
What time is it?

1416
01:24:06,716 --> 01:24:07,816
Almost 5:30.

1417
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:12,855
And remember, worse than
escarole poisoning, okay?

1418
01:24:26,471 --> 01:24:27,705
Morning.

1419
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:28,806
Morning.

1420
01:24:28,873 --> 01:24:29,907
You're new.

1421
01:24:29,975 --> 01:24:31,809
Yeah.

1422
01:24:34,046 --> 01:24:36,046
Mom, I'm starving.

1423
01:24:36,114 --> 01:24:37,782
The bus will
be here soon.

1424
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:41,119
No, it'll be late.
It always is.

1425
01:24:43,623 --> 01:24:46,659
Uh, I'll go get us
some donuts, okay?

1426
01:24:46,727 --> 01:24:47,827
Stay here.

1427
01:25:04,512 --> 01:25:08,148
Can I get, uh, four
plain cake donuts,

1428
01:25:08,216 --> 01:25:09,550
a milk and a large coffee?

1429
01:25:09,618 --> 01:25:11,152
I don't have any
regular coffee.

1430
01:25:11,220 --> 01:25:12,186
I just have decaf.

1431
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:14,155
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

1432
01:25:16,525 --> 01:25:17,458
I drank it all.

1433
01:25:17,526 --> 01:25:20,261
Fine. Just, uh,
give me a decaf.

1434
01:25:24,935 --> 01:25:27,303
Mom?

1435
01:25:27,369 --> 01:25:29,471
Gull, I told you
to stay in line.

1436
01:26:03,810 --> 01:26:04,876
Kailey? Kailey?

1437
01:26:04,944 --> 01:26:07,012
I need you
to stop running now.

1438
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,314
Kailey?

1439
01:26:08,683 --> 01:26:11,317
Look at me.
Look at me.

1440
01:26:12,318 --> 01:26:13,352
Kailey!

1441
01:26:15,122 --> 01:26:18,359
No, no, no, leave the bag!
Leave the gun!

1442
01:26:18,426 --> 01:26:19,626
Kailey! No!

1443
01:26:21,996 --> 01:26:23,397
Mom!

1444
01:26:23,465 --> 01:26:25,199
Okay. Get in the truck.

1445
01:26:33,242 --> 01:26:35,209
No, it's okay.

1446
01:26:35,277 --> 01:26:37,779
Okay. It's okay.
I'm fine, Gulls.

1447
01:26:37,847 --> 01:26:43,184
I just... I just need you
to shift again, okay?

1448
01:26:43,252 --> 01:26:46,055
Just... I'll get you into first,

1449
01:26:46,123 --> 01:26:49,190
but from then on,
it's all you, kid. Okay?

1450
01:26:49,358 --> 01:26:50,627
Okay, come on.

1451
01:26:50,794 --> 01:26:52,067
That's my boy.

1452
01:28:05,775 --> 01:28:08,378
Hey. You Gulley?

1453
01:28:08,745 --> 01:28:10,313
Yeah, I am.

1454
01:28:11,281 --> 01:28:12,932
I got a letter for you.
