1
00:02:38,554 --> 00:02:41,723
Time for action!

2
00:02:42,724 --> 00:02:46,979
Gangrene, you slimeball!

3
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,440
Hands up!

4
00:03:10,252 --> 00:03:14,422
Gangrene, you slimeball!

5
00:03:18,593 --> 00:03:21,179
- Hey, Thomas.
- Hi, Brian.

6
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:23,807
- How was school, eh?
- Fine.

7
00:03:23,848 --> 00:03:26,142
good.

8
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,908
Time's up, you slimeball.

9
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,203
- Let's go outside.
- I'm almost done.

10
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:48,540
Come on, mom, you promised.

11
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:51,084
I know
and I am a terrible mother.

12
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,337
- You're horrible.
- Horrible?

13
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:57,507
- You're dreadful.
- Dreadful? Oh!

14
00:03:57,548 --> 00:04:01,302
Well, I知 gonna be horrible
and I知 gonna be dreadful

15
00:04:01,344 --> 00:04:03,471
if I don't finish
this chapter.

16
00:04:03,513 --> 00:04:06,474
So I need at least...

17
00:04:06,516 --> 00:04:09,435
- five minutes.
- Three.

18
00:04:09,477 --> 00:04:10,436
Four.

19
00:04:10,478 --> 00:04:14,607
Deal. We're escaping outside!
Whoosh!

20
00:04:34,418 --> 00:04:37,713
- Hey.
- Hey.

21
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:42,218
What did they say?

22
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,179
Not interested.

23
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:49,433
What do they know?
They rejected my first novel anyway.

24
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,437
It's Tabitha king
syndrome.

25
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:54,605
Stephen King's wife.

26
00:04:54,647 --> 00:04:59,360
She's a good enough writer,
but no one knows her.

27
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:03,322
All they know is Stephen King.

28
00:05:04,823 --> 00:05:06,867
They'll know you
one day.

29
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:09,870
Look at all the help
you've given me.

30
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:13,290
That's editing, darling.
It's not the same thing.

31
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:17,836
See? "not sufficiently
mysterious for a mystery,

32
00:05:17,878 --> 00:05:22,299
nor sufficiently thrilling
for a thriller."

33
00:05:25,677 --> 00:05:29,389
You know, it wouldn't
be the worst thing

34
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:33,101
to add a few thrills
and resubmit it.

35
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:35,145
Throw in some more blood?

36
00:05:35,187 --> 00:05:38,315
Psychopath jumping
out of the closet with an axe?

37
00:05:38,357 --> 00:05:41,860
No, it's not
the English tradition.

38
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:45,405
I thought a sort of style, wit...

39
00:05:45,447 --> 00:05:47,658
imagination.

40
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,160
Darling, you have wit?

41
00:05:50,202 --> 00:05:51,286
Very good.

42
00:05:51,328 --> 00:05:55,457
You're the best editor in London
is that so bad?

43
00:05:55,499 --> 00:05:57,793
Max Perkins saved Hemingway.

44
00:05:57,834 --> 00:05:59,920
Yes, well, no one
remembers max Perkins,

45
00:05:59,961 --> 00:06:04,257
and he's right up there
with Tabitha what's-her-face.

46
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:08,595
Well, I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

47
00:06:09,596 --> 00:06:12,849
Well, you do realize,
darling, that...

48
00:06:15,101 --> 00:06:18,647
that I知 supposed to be
saying that to you?

49
00:06:21,691 --> 00:06:24,945
Hey, when can I read some?

50
00:06:24,986 --> 00:06:28,740
About three minutes.
That's all Thomas has given me.

51
00:06:28,782 --> 00:06:32,243
Okay, three minutes it is.

52
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:57,227
Action alert!

53
00:06:57,268 --> 00:06:59,646
Hand's up!

54
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,957
Action alert!

55
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:47,336
Hands up!

56
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:23,705
Brian, dinner's ready.

57
00:09:23,747 --> 00:09:26,416
Yeah, coming.

58
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,004
Thomas.

59
00:09:33,965 --> 00:09:36,968
Thomas?

60
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:07,540
Thomas?

61
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,585
Thomas?

62
00:10:18,968 --> 00:10:21,137
Thomas?

63
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:56,630
Thomas! No!

64
00:10:56,672 --> 00:10:59,216
Oh, baby.

65
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:02,636
Brian! Come on.

66
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:07,600
Come on! Breathe!

67
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:10,186
Brian!

68
00:11:40,632 --> 00:11:42,801
no...

69
00:11:42,843 --> 00:11:46,263
no no...

70
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:50,309
no!

71
00:12:57,292 --> 00:12:59,377
I searched
every website.

72
00:12:59,419 --> 00:13:02,380
This is everything you want.

73
00:13:02,422 --> 00:13:04,299
It's remote, quiet,

74
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,718
- no one around for miles.
- Ingonish cove.

75
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,347
You'll get so much writing done
it's got the boats we used in Suffolk

76
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:13,975
do you know how long
you might want it for?

77
00:13:14,017 --> 00:13:15,268
I don't know.

78
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:18,980
Just whatever it takes
for me to finish this book.

79
00:13:19,022 --> 00:13:21,441
It looks great.

80
00:13:21,482 --> 00:13:24,152
Well, Brian hasn't
been any help.

81
00:13:24,193 --> 00:13:26,821
He should have been
there for you.

82
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:30,700
Yeah, weli...
he tried.

83
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:34,829
Look, whatever we had,
we lost a long time ago.

84
00:13:34,871 --> 00:13:36,330
Yeah, I know.

85
00:13:36,372 --> 00:13:40,042
But are you really gonna
be okay out there, all by yourself?

86
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:44,213
- It's only been eight months.
- Yeah, I知 fine.

87
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:49,302
Would you like to get some tea?

88
00:13:49,343 --> 00:13:51,512
Yeah.

89
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:01,939
I'll get you wherever you are!

90
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:48,253
If you're really gonna go,
take these with you.

91
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:53,091
You know I was wanting to try
it without it for awhile, Robert.

92
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,593
It's just in case.

93
00:16:01,474 --> 00:16:03,935
Rachel.

94
00:16:09,107 --> 00:16:10,441
Shall I call Bartlett?

95
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:14,404
I'm not up for divorce
lawyers right now.

96
00:16:14,445 --> 00:16:18,408
Let's just deal with all that
when I get back.

97
00:16:22,704 --> 00:16:25,581
So how did it go?
All this time,

98
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:28,251
she's never talked
to me about Thomas.

99
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:32,797
She won't open up to me at all.

100
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:35,383
You've got to remember it's not
the same for you.

101
00:16:35,425 --> 00:16:37,135
What, because he's not my son?

102
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:40,930
Because you weren't
the one who left the gate open.

103
00:16:48,771 --> 00:16:51,816
- Hello.
Rachel, how are you?

104
00:16:51,857 --> 00:16:54,860
You should see where
I am right now.

105
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:57,363
- You're there already?
- It's beautiful,

106
00:16:57,405 --> 00:16:59,573
and there's not another
house around for miles.

107
00:16:59,615 --> 00:17:01,701
They said there
was a lighthouse
there as well?

108
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:04,745
- Mm-hmm.
- You've got one in your book
haven't you?

109
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:06,372
You can do some research.

110
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:09,500
It's perfect.
It's exactly what I wanted.

111
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,920
If I can't write here,
I can't write anywhere.

112
00:17:12,962 --> 00:17:16,298
Ah. At least you're
not stuck writing crap

113
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,301
for a crap paper,
like I am.

114
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:21,095
It's not that bad.

115
00:17:21,137 --> 00:17:23,514
It keeps the bills at bay.

116
00:17:23,556 --> 00:17:27,059
- Almost
- yeah, which is good for you.

117
00:17:27,101 --> 00:17:30,813
Which I don't
need reminding.

118
00:17:30,854 --> 00:17:32,523
Hey, remember...

119
00:17:32,565 --> 00:17:35,359
if you want me to come out there,
you just say the word.

120
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:39,405
Thanks.
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna be okay.

121
00:17:39,446 --> 00:17:45,035
I really... I really think
I知 gonna be okay.

122
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:02,636
Excuse me...

123
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,681
excuse me? Am I headed the
right way into town?

124
00:18:05,722 --> 00:18:08,308
Sorry?

125
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,894
Am I...

126
00:18:10,936 --> 00:18:13,438
am I headed the right
way into town?

127
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,358
Yeah, you just follow up the beach.
You can't miss it.

128
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,443
Okay, I wasn't sure.

129
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:19,820
Are you traveling through?

130
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:24,157
Oh, no no, actually, I致e just
moved into foster road, number 1.

131
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:25,700
Foster road, number 1?
Are you sure?

132
00:18:25,742 --> 00:18:29,579
I think so.
It's the only house on the road.

133
00:18:29,621 --> 00:18:31,623
Yeah, that's it.

134
00:18:31,665 --> 00:18:33,625
I'm Finlay Murray,

135
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:36,294
what passes for a police
sergeant round here.

136
00:18:36,336 --> 00:18:39,923
- And I知 Mary.
- Hello. Rachel Carlson.

137
00:18:39,965 --> 00:18:42,384
- So you here
on your own?
- Yeah.

138
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,929
Well, if you hang on,
I値l give you a lift in.
It's a wee bit of a hike.

139
00:18:45,971 --> 00:18:49,975
Thank you,
but this is what I知 here for.

140
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:51,977
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

141
00:18:52,018 --> 00:18:53,687
- Okay.
- To the beach.

142
00:18:53,728 --> 00:18:58,400
- Yep.
- All right. Thank you.

143
00:19:50,576 --> 00:19:53,538
Your son's waiting for you.

144
00:19:55,122 --> 00:19:57,041
On the swings.

145
00:19:57,083 --> 00:20:00,670
He's been waiting for you.
He told me.

146
00:20:02,046 --> 00:20:04,006
My son?

147
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:08,469
I'm sorry.

148
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:13,474
It must have been
someone else's little boy.

149
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:19,230
Wait. Can I talk to you?

150
00:20:19,271 --> 00:20:23,234
I was mistaken,
that's all.

151
00:20:27,947 --> 00:20:30,866
It's a beautiful day,
isn't it?

152
00:21:15,035 --> 00:21:20,666
Mom? We're escaping outside
come with us.

153
00:21:22,584 --> 00:21:27,130
You promised,
but you never came.

154
00:22:56,844 --> 00:23:00,640
It's impressive,
don't you think?

155
00:23:00,681 --> 00:23:01,349
Quite.

156
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:04,769
I didn't realize that there was
anyone else around.

157
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,229
Carry on.

158
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:08,940
Lighthouses are a dying breed.

159
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:17,531
I'm Angus McCulloch,
the lighthouse keeper.

160
00:23:17,573 --> 00:23:19,450
Rachel.

161
00:23:19,492 --> 00:23:21,077
Sorry, I just assumed

162
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:24,622
that all lighthouses
were automated now.

163
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:26,207
Well, most of them are.

164
00:23:26,248 --> 00:23:29,001
In a few years,
I値l be gone, too.

165
00:23:30,878 --> 00:23:33,255
So what brings
you out here?

166
00:23:33,297 --> 00:23:35,382
I'm researching
lighthouses for a book.

167
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:38,844
It's a long way from America
just to see a lighthouse.

168
00:23:38,886 --> 00:23:42,640
No no, I live in London
actually.

169
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:46,393
I'm just out here
doing some writing.

170
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:48,896
Oh, you're in
the cottage.

171
00:23:48,937 --> 00:23:50,939
It's about time
someone moved in.

172
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:52,983
It's been empty for years.

173
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:56,779
Well, you've certainly
come to the right place

174
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,239
to write a book.

175
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:02,534
Did you meet the horses yet?

176
00:24:03,952 --> 00:24:06,121
That's a story for you.

177
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:08,791
A Spanish galleon shipwrecked,

178
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:11,585
right there, 1754.

179
00:24:11,627 --> 00:24:14,338
The entire crew died,

180
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:17,549
but a few horses
swam here to safety,

181
00:24:17,584 --> 00:24:20,719
and they've been here
ever since.

182
00:24:20,761 --> 00:24:23,847
And they've never
been off the island?

183
00:24:26,016 --> 00:24:28,644
I can think of worse.

184
00:24:30,228 --> 00:24:30,937
Yeah.

185
00:24:30,979 --> 00:24:35,567
Listen, I知 just
putting some dinner on.
You're welcome to stay,

186
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:36,818
have something to eat.

187
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,072
I can tell you
everything you need
to know about lighthouses.

188
00:24:40,113 --> 00:24:42,908
Thanks, I need to get back.

189
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,494
I'm still unpacking boxes.

190
00:24:45,535 --> 00:24:48,038
Well, look, maybe next week.

191
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:49,998
Same time?

192
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,751
I'll cook some extra
and if you don't show,

193
00:24:52,792 --> 00:24:55,337
I値l eat with the horses.

194
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,965
We should be friends.

195
00:24:59,674 --> 00:25:01,968
We're neighbors now.

196
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,971
We should.

197
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,061
"to my love in
honor of what we decided yesterday."

198
00:26:36,103 --> 00:26:39,565
"Forever yours, k."

199
00:26:39,607 --> 00:26:43,068
"Page 145, line 7."

200
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:48,115
"Today I begin to understand
what love must be,

201
00:26:48,157 --> 00:26:50,451
if it exists.

202
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:51,410
When we are parted,

203
00:26:51,452 --> 00:26:55,998
we each feel the lack
of the other half of ourselves.

204
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,083
We are incomplete,

205
00:26:58,125 --> 00:27:00,794
like a book
in two volumes

206
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:04,214
of which the first
has been lost.

207
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:07,593
This is what
I imagine love to be...

208
00:27:07,634 --> 00:27:11,305
incompleteness in absence."

209
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:33,452
I'll get you wherever you are!

210
00:28:10,238 --> 00:28:12,574
Thomas.

211
00:28:25,753 --> 00:28:28,756
Thomas.

212
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:32,302
Mama.

213
00:28:33,636 --> 00:28:36,639
It's okay, mom.

214
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:37,974
Don't go.

215
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,978
- Don't run, don't go.
- I won't.

216
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:51,029
Come. Be with me.

217
00:30:43,974 --> 00:30:46,018
Ah!

218
00:30:51,189 --> 00:30:53,900
Hello.

219
00:30:53,942 --> 00:30:55,610
You turned up at last.

220
00:30:55,652 --> 00:30:59,072
Good timing
I知 just burning the fish.

221
00:30:59,114 --> 00:31:00,699
It's good to see you.

222
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,701
How's your research coming?

223
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:04,786
Well, it's all right.
Could be better.

224
00:31:04,828 --> 00:31:08,748
That's why I知 here.
I was hoping I could get a tour.

225
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:10,834
Okay.

226
00:31:11,126 --> 00:31:14,254
How about some lunch
before the tour?

227
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:18,341
Is there anything
else on the menu?

228
00:31:18,383 --> 00:31:20,969
Why is it that everyone
paints their boats

229
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,596
the exact same color
as their houses?

230
00:31:24,973 --> 00:31:28,017
Well, that's actually
a tradition here.

231
00:31:28,059 --> 00:31:31,938
The wife needs to be able
to look out on the water

232
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:34,107
and know her
husband's okay.

233
00:31:34,149 --> 00:31:37,110
That's very romantic.

234
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:41,364
And we also
get a tax break
on the paint.

235
00:31:42,365 --> 00:31:45,618
Which is also very romantic.

236
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:48,329
Very romantic.

237
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,961
I can't make it!

238
00:31:59,424 --> 00:32:01,426
Quick.

239
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:08,599
Do you ever get lonely
working out here?

240
00:32:08,641 --> 00:32:12,562
You never get lonely
sitting at your typewriter?

241
00:32:15,189 --> 00:32:17,483
Sometimes.

242
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:20,486
I like being alone.

243
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:24,365
Do you really
like it?

244
00:32:24,407 --> 00:32:28,244
Or do you think it's
just something you've
gotten used to?

245
00:32:28,286 --> 00:32:33,374
Or maybe I like it
because I致e gotten used to it.

246
00:32:33,708 --> 00:32:37,920
- I love it out here.
- Who do you talk to?

247
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:40,506
Who do
you
talk to?

248
00:32:40,548 --> 00:32:43,884
Isn't that what you
love about writing?

249
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:46,971
The solitude?

250
00:32:47,012 --> 00:32:49,431
I write because...

251
00:32:50,391 --> 00:32:54,395
well, I don't function
very well as a human being

252
00:32:54,436 --> 00:32:56,355
unless I知 writing

253
00:32:56,397 --> 00:33:00,818
well, what are you writing now?

254
00:33:05,114 --> 00:33:07,866
I'm not.

255
00:33:13,956 --> 00:33:16,792
Don't tell me
you paint as well!

256
00:33:16,834 --> 00:33:20,462
Oh, no.

257
00:33:22,464 --> 00:33:25,843
Kate, my wife.

258
00:33:25,884 --> 00:33:27,886
She...

259
00:33:28,428 --> 00:33:33,600
we haven't seen each
other for a long time.

260
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:36,186
She loved it out here at first.

261
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:41,441
But in the end,
the isolation was too much for her.

262
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:47,280
Loneliness
can make you
a little crazy, I think.

263
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:53,412
Come on.

264
00:34:01,002 --> 00:34:01,461
Wow!

265
00:34:01,503 --> 00:34:06,341
Kate could never understand
why I wouldn't leave here.

266
00:34:08,134 --> 00:34:10,845
But my father lived here

267
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:13,557
and his father before him.

268
00:34:15,392 --> 00:34:17,644
My great-grandfather,

269
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,896
he built the balcony

270
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:24,109
from wood that was washed
ashore from a shipwreck.

271
00:34:26,486 --> 00:34:29,197
This is him.

272
00:34:30,573 --> 00:34:33,493
I could never leave here.

273
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:36,538
You'll see why.

274
00:34:36,579 --> 00:34:38,790
Come on.

275
00:35:31,342 --> 00:35:35,554
By the way,
I致e brought you something

276
00:35:35,596 --> 00:35:38,057
as a thank you for the tour.

277
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,559
It's one of my books.

278
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:42,645
- I had it sent.
- Thanks.

279
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:47,650
"Dreamers awake,"
by Rachel Carlson.

280
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:49,443
I'm impressed.

281
00:35:49,485 --> 00:35:51,612
Is it a comedy or a tragedy?

282
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:54,240
Well, it's a mystery.

283
00:35:54,281 --> 00:35:59,411
But please be kind... it is
the first novel I had published.

284
00:35:59,453 --> 00:36:01,205
Weli...

285
00:36:01,247 --> 00:36:04,083
I値l find out
all about you.

286
00:36:04,124 --> 00:36:06,460
Maybe.

287
00:36:11,006 --> 00:36:14,593
If you need any help,
just send out a flare.

288
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:18,681
- I'll keep an eye out for you.
- Thank you. I really...

289
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:21,809
I really enjoyed that today.

290
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,561
Aye. Me too.

291
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:01,824
So have you
slept with him yet?

292
00:38:01,866 --> 00:38:04,869
It's just nice to have
someone to talk to.

293
00:38:04,911 --> 00:38:07,038
Meaning you haven't
slept with him.

294
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,165
You know,
you're starting to sound

295
00:38:09,207 --> 00:38:13,378
like you're conducting
a tabloid interview, my friend.

296
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:15,088
You know me, always working,

297
00:38:15,129 --> 00:38:16,756
always looking for the angle.

298
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:19,634
And you know I rely
on you for my kicks.

299
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:23,763
Is that the sea I can hear?

300
00:38:23,805 --> 00:38:27,892
Yes, it's less
than 10 feet away.

301
00:38:27,934 --> 00:38:31,103
- Can you hear the crashing?
- Wow, look at you.

302
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:32,813
Number one best sellers,

303
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:35,858
waves at your feet,
romance on a deserted island.

304
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,402
Tough life.

305
00:38:40,446 --> 00:38:44,325
Rachel, I知 sorry.
That came out wrong.

306
00:38:44,367 --> 00:38:47,703
Sharon, forget it.
It's okay.

307
00:38:47,745 --> 00:38:50,581
Look, I wouldn't have made it
this far without you.

308
00:38:50,623 --> 00:38:54,794
I mean it.
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

309
00:38:54,835 --> 00:38:57,171
Okay.

310
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:11,769
Okay, don't peek.

311
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:17,149
Qu... qu... qu-quick quick quick.

312
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,068
Ready?

313
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:21,904
Smile.
- Okay.

314
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:27,409
And no faces this time.

315
00:39:27,451 --> 00:39:30,245
Hurry hurry,
come on, come on.

316
00:39:30,287 --> 00:39:32,873
Wait wait wait.
It's gonna come.

317
00:39:32,915 --> 00:39:35,417
- You smiling?
You promise? - Yes.

318
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,711
- Yes.
- You promise?

319
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:45,030
Rachei...

320
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:47,387
are you okay?

321
00:39:47,429 --> 00:39:50,349
Rachel?

322
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,894
Is something wrong?

323
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:57,105
What's wrong?

324
00:39:57,147 --> 00:40:00,317
I think I need to get back.

325
00:40:02,611 --> 00:40:04,654
Why?

326
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,994
I'm sorry.

327
00:40:34,601 --> 00:40:36,895
- Afternoon, Rachel.
- Afternoon.

328
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:39,189
Are we gonna see you
here on Sunday?

329
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:43,068
I don't think so.
Your man and I aren't
on very good terms.

330
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:46,946
Don't you worry about
that.
All the more
reason to come.

331
00:40:47,947 --> 00:40:50,909
Your cross is broken.

332
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,160
I know.

333
00:40:52,202 --> 00:40:55,538
It's this
weekend's chore.

334
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:18,227
It's the gate, isn't it?

335
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,522
What?

336
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:24,650
Why you're so sad.

337
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:28,070
You left the gate open.

338
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,172
You haven't been able
to go out there since
he died, have you?

339
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:49,008
All right, ready?

340
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:51,761
All right, here we go.

341
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:54,430
Now face this way.
Okay, good.

342
00:41:54,472 --> 00:41:58,309
Okay, let's smile.

343
00:41:58,350 --> 00:41:59,268
Smile.

344
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,271
He's beside you,
your son.

345
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:04,815
He's dripping wet.

346
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:08,777
He follows you everywhere.

347
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:12,698
He's trying to hold your hand.

348
00:42:25,294 --> 00:42:27,004
What's she been saying?

349
00:42:27,046 --> 00:42:28,797
More of her psychic
mumbo-jumbo?

350
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:33,010
Listen, don't worry,
she'll say anything to get
somebody to talk to her.

351
00:42:33,052 --> 00:42:37,848
Watch your fingers. Jim,
get us that dustpan and brush.

352
00:42:45,647 --> 00:42:48,066
Yes yes, I can hear her.
I'm not answering.

353
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:52,821
Is anybody here?
- I should have never
have gone to see her.

354
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:02,205
I don't want to talk
about it anymore.

355
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,373
I'm not listening.

356
00:43:03,415 --> 00:43:06,835
You can keep talking,
but I知 not listening.

357
00:43:06,877 --> 00:43:09,087
I'm not getting out
of this chair

358
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:12,007
for the love of god or money.

359
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:14,968
I can't save her.

360
00:43:16,386 --> 00:43:18,513
I can't save anyone.

361
00:43:18,555 --> 00:43:23,059
Things are gonna get worse.

362
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:04,559
Rachel. Come in.

363
00:44:06,811 --> 00:44:09,731
Do you think it's possible?

364
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,109
Do you think I could be
getting messages from him?

365
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:17,280
I don't know.

366
00:44:17,322 --> 00:44:18,906
Maybe.

367
00:44:18,948 --> 00:44:21,492
Maybe the dead miss us

368
00:44:21,534 --> 00:44:24,704
even more than we miss them.

369
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:27,874
I've replayed it so many times.

370
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:32,587
If I壇 only gone out to play
with him like I said I would,

371
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,756
that this never would
have happened.

372
00:44:38,426 --> 00:44:40,178
And I keep thinking of him

373
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:45,099
in the water, struggling,
and I wasn't there.

374
00:44:46,976 --> 00:44:48,185
I'm the mother.

375
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:52,231
I'm supposed to be there to
protect him, and I wasn't.

376
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,159
I came here thinking
that I could write,

377
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,244
and that everything
would be okay.

378
00:45:05,286 --> 00:45:07,621
And you know what?
It's not okay.

379
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:09,957
It's not okay,
and I知 not okay.

380
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:12,751
Rachel, shh.

381
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:15,546
Shh shh shh.

382
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,797
What is this?

383
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,841
It's an old Celtic ballad.

384
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:45,135
"Caileag an stoirm."

385
00:46:45,176 --> 00:46:47,429
"Girl in the storm."

386
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,055
It's beautiful.

387
00:46:49,097 --> 00:46:53,351
I finished your book.

388
00:46:54,894 --> 00:46:58,898
Did you learn all about me?

389
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:00,984
Maybe.

390
00:47:03,069 --> 00:47:05,238
Here.

391
00:47:07,198 --> 00:47:09,993
I made something for you.

392
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,663
To inspire you.

393
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:28,261
I'll leave a key out for you...

394
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,933
so you can come up
whenever you want to,

395
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:36,936
in case I知 out
fishing or something.

396
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:53,369
Look,
it's mother-of-pearl.

397
00:47:55,121 --> 00:47:55,913
I love these.

398
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:59,750
Do you know the old
Celtic legend about them?

399
00:47:59,792 --> 00:48:03,671
- About those?
- Yeah.

400
00:48:03,713 --> 00:48:05,589
No.

401
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:07,925
Come on.

402
00:48:11,887 --> 00:48:17,101
First,
we have to bury it together.

403
00:48:20,604 --> 00:48:22,731
- Together.
- Right.

404
00:48:22,773 --> 00:48:26,235
And then if one
of us ever returns

405
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:29,196
and digs it up, then...

406
00:48:29,238 --> 00:48:32,449
then we were meant
for each other?

407
00:48:32,491 --> 00:48:37,371
Well, actually,
I don't know because
I just made it up.

408
00:48:37,413 --> 00:48:38,747
Very Celtic of you.

409
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:43,419
You know, I was thinking
that exact same thing.

410
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,696
Do you know Mary,
Finlay's wife?

411
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:52,553
She's having a little
birthday thing

412
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:53,762
in the village tomorrow,

413
00:48:53,804 --> 00:48:58,725
and I was thinking
that maybe you'd like to go.

414
00:49:01,895 --> 00:49:06,045
I'd love to go.

415
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:10,195
So like, 2:00?

416
00:49:10,237 --> 00:49:13,407
2:00

417
00:49:20,706 --> 00:49:23,834
hey, Rachel.

418
00:49:29,965 --> 00:49:32,342
I'll see you tomorrow.

419
00:49:47,565 --> 00:49:49,818
2:00, right?

420
00:50:33,695 --> 00:50:35,780
"she lay there

421
00:50:35,822 --> 00:50:37,865
in the half light of the cabin

422
00:50:37,907 --> 00:50:40,952
unable to sleep.

423
00:50:40,993 --> 00:50:44,205
In the morning,
she told him she had,

424
00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:46,165
for there were still
some limits

425
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:49,252
to the things she could
say to him then.

426
00:50:49,293 --> 00:50:52,046
But most of the night,
she watched his eyelids

427
00:50:52,088 --> 00:50:54,840
and his lips and his face.

428
00:50:54,882 --> 00:50:59,095
And in the stillness,

429
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:02,431
she felt peace."

430
00:51:50,687 --> 00:51:52,749
- Hey, Rachel, how you doing?
- Hello.

431
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:54,812
- Are you all right?
- Oh, I知 all right.

432
00:51:54,854 --> 00:51:57,023
Rachel, you made it!

433
00:51:57,065 --> 00:51:57,940
Oh, great.

434
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:01,861
- There you go, honey.
- I've got something for you.
Happy birthday.

435
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:05,281
That's so sweet of you.
Thanks very much.

436
00:52:05,323 --> 00:52:07,158
Would you like a drink?

437
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:11,496
- A lager.
- It's on the way.

438
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,331
Rachel, your glass is empty.

439
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,960
Happy birthday to you

440
00:52:59,001 --> 00:53:02,797
happy birthday to you

441
00:53:02,839 --> 00:53:06,676
happy birthday, dear Mary

442
00:53:06,717 --> 00:53:09,846
happy birthday to you.

443
00:53:13,057 --> 00:53:15,143
Happy birthday.

444
00:53:40,168 --> 00:53:43,463
Excuse me, Mary,
I知 sorry to interrupt.

445
00:53:43,504 --> 00:53:46,758
I'm meeting a friend here
Angus McCulloch.

446
00:53:46,799 --> 00:53:50,511
- I thought you might
have seen him.
- What are you talking about?

447
00:53:50,553 --> 00:53:54,640
Well, he was supposed
to be here an hour ago.

448
00:53:54,682 --> 00:53:56,976
The lighthouse keeper.

449
00:53:57,018 --> 00:53:59,228
Aye, I know who he is.

450
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,232
What does he look like,
your Angus?

451
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:05,151
Um...

452
00:54:05,193 --> 00:54:07,528
dark hair, nice blue eyes.

453
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:09,864
Aye, that sounds like Angus.

454
00:54:09,906 --> 00:54:12,617
I've not seen him
these seven years,

455
00:54:12,658 --> 00:54:15,328
and neither have you,
'cause he's dead.

456
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:18,664
No, there must be some mistake.

457
00:54:18,706 --> 00:54:21,667
Oh, he's dead all right,
him and the wife.

458
00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:24,504
I chose the dress
we buried her in.

459
00:54:24,545 --> 00:54:29,383
No, you're kidding,
right?

460
00:54:33,346 --> 00:54:38,142
Reverend, you've been
out to the lighthouse,
haven't you?

461
00:54:38,184 --> 00:54:39,394
No, not for years.

462
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:44,023
- Nobody goes out there anymore.
- But you know Angus McCulloch.

463
00:54:44,065 --> 00:54:46,401
I used to, aye, but...

464
00:54:46,442 --> 00:54:51,072
he's been dead for six...
no, seven years.

465
00:54:54,617 --> 00:54:56,494
Is this a joke?

466
00:54:56,536 --> 00:54:59,372
Rachel, this isn't funny.

467
00:54:59,414 --> 00:55:02,542
People here don't
laugh about this.

468
00:55:13,261 --> 00:55:15,638
What is this?

469
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:22,061
Why... why are you doing this?

470
00:55:22,103 --> 00:55:26,441
Why... why are you doing this?

471
00:56:54,487 --> 00:56:56,614
Angus?

472
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:32,608
Loneliness can make you
a little crazy, I think.

473
00:57:50,042 --> 00:57:52,420
Kate could never understand

474
00:57:52,462 --> 00:57:55,506
why I wouldn't leave here.

475
00:57:55,548 --> 00:57:58,718
But my father lived here,

476
00:57:58,753 --> 00:58:01,888
and his father before him.

477
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,853
I could never leave here.

478
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:22,784
Maybe the dead miss us
even more than we miss them.

479
00:58:35,797 --> 00:58:38,091
Rachel.

480
00:58:40,093 --> 00:58:41,803
What are you doing here?

481
00:58:41,844 --> 00:58:44,222
You're gonna stir up trouble.

482
00:58:44,263 --> 00:58:46,891
I came to look for Angus.

483
00:58:46,933 --> 00:58:49,560
Angus McCulloch is dead

484
00:58:49,602 --> 00:58:51,771
and buried.

485
00:58:52,146 --> 00:58:55,525
I saw him jump off
that cliff over there.

486
00:58:55,566 --> 00:58:58,945
I was with him, right here,
last night.

487
00:58:58,986 --> 00:59:01,322
You couldn't have been.

488
00:59:01,364 --> 00:59:03,866
Seven years ago

489
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:06,077
I came out to visit Angus,

490
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:11,666
just as I had done
dozens of times before.

491
00:59:13,209 --> 00:59:16,963
There was a tape playing...
"caileag an stoirm"...

492
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:20,466
Angus's favorite song.

493
00:59:20,508 --> 00:59:23,970
I found Kate inside.

494
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:31,060
Angus came home early
from the village,

495
00:59:31,102 --> 00:59:34,772
caught her in bed
with a local fisherman...

496
00:59:34,814 --> 00:59:37,817
Gordon McCloud.

497
00:59:37,859 --> 00:59:40,903
It had been going on
for months.

498
00:59:40,945 --> 00:59:45,283
Angus was the only
one that didn't know
anything about it.

499
00:59:45,324 --> 00:59:47,827
I caught a glimpse of him,

500
00:59:47,869 --> 00:59:49,662
through the window.

501
00:59:49,704 --> 00:59:52,248
I followed him up to the balcony,

502
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:54,917
but I was too late.

503
00:59:56,377 --> 00:59:58,963
I felt for him.

504
00:59:59,005 --> 01:00:01,507
We all did.

505
01:00:01,549 --> 01:00:03,760
He just worshipped Kate.

506
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:06,637
When he caught her with Gordon,

507
01:00:06,679 --> 01:00:09,515
he must have just snapped.

508
01:00:09,557 --> 01:00:12,351
I heard all this from Kate.

509
01:00:12,393 --> 01:00:15,438
She lived long enough
to tell me that Angus
didn't kill her.

510
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,525
She came between them
in the struggle.

511
01:00:19,567 --> 01:00:21,235
Just before she died,

512
01:00:21,277 --> 01:00:25,907
she prayed that Angus
would forgive her.

513
01:00:28,743 --> 01:00:31,496
We all knew what was going on.

514
01:00:31,537 --> 01:00:33,372
Nobody said anything.

515
01:00:33,414 --> 01:00:38,294
Those three deaths are
as much on our hands
as they are on his.

516
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:44,008
It just can't be the same man.

517
01:00:48,221 --> 01:00:49,722
I...

518
01:00:49,764 --> 01:00:53,267
I can prove he was here.

519
01:00:58,898 --> 01:01:02,235
If I can just get
this film developed.

520
01:01:02,276 --> 01:01:05,613
There's a photo
of us together, and...

521
01:01:09,033 --> 01:01:13,454
well, I... I must
have just misplaced
the film somewhere.

522
01:01:13,496 --> 01:01:16,249
You couldn't have met
anyone out there.

523
01:01:17,959 --> 01:01:20,002
He also did
a carving
for me that...

524
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:22,255
- Rachel.
...was right here.

525
01:01:22,296 --> 01:01:25,049
Rachel, nobody goes
out there anymore.

526
01:01:25,091 --> 01:01:27,593
The lighthouse was automated
after the murders

527
01:01:27,635 --> 01:01:29,053
so we wouldn't have to.

528
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:31,931
And nobody's lived
in this house since then, either.

529
01:01:31,973 --> 01:01:34,976
What do you mean,
this house?

530
01:01:35,017 --> 01:01:38,771
Well, this was
Gordon McCloud's house.

531
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:43,985
He and Kate used to signal
each other with lights

532
01:01:44,026 --> 01:01:46,446
when Angus was away.

533
01:01:56,539 --> 01:01:59,083
This who you mean?

534
01:02:13,431 --> 01:02:17,018
This just doesn't make any sense.

535
01:02:17,727 --> 01:02:20,855
I've been with him practically
every day this last month.

536
01:02:20,897 --> 01:02:25,902
We've eaten together,
we've walked on the beach,
we've been with the horses.

537
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:27,904
It's not like
I致e been out there

538
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:29,822
talking to myself all this time.

539
01:02:29,864 --> 01:02:34,035
Well, if you've been flirting
with Angus McCulloch,

540
01:02:34,077 --> 01:02:39,248
who's that buried
in Ingonish cemetery?

541
01:03:44,605 --> 01:03:46,566
You didn't believe us, eh?

542
01:03:46,607 --> 01:03:50,903
I don't know what
to believe anymore.

543
01:03:52,530 --> 01:03:56,117
You still haven't
fixed the cross.

544
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:00,830
No. No, I haven't.

545
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:12,049
It's this weekend's chore.

546
01:04:43,539 --> 01:04:45,792
Excuse me.

547
01:04:45,833 --> 01:04:48,544
You have some newspapers
missing on the microfilm.

548
01:04:48,586 --> 01:04:51,005
It's a miracle we have
any there at all.

549
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:52,215
What you looking for?

550
01:04:52,256 --> 01:04:56,677
Anything around
February 12th or 13th, 1998.

551
01:04:56,719 --> 01:04:58,179
The McCulloch murder.

552
01:04:58,221 --> 01:05:00,681
Kids probably pinched them.

553
01:05:00,723 --> 01:05:03,142
Gory murders... kids love 'em.

554
01:05:05,478 --> 01:05:08,376
What about internet access?

555
01:05:14,195 --> 01:05:17,740
The computer's being fixed.

556
01:05:17,782 --> 01:05:19,283
Sorry.

557
01:05:23,913 --> 01:05:27,417
Look. I just need anything

558
01:05:27,458 --> 01:05:30,795
that has a photo
of Angus McCulloch.

559
01:05:30,837 --> 01:05:34,215
Try Ullapool public library.

560
01:05:44,308 --> 01:05:46,227
You have reached
Ullapool public library.

561
01:05:46,269 --> 01:05:51,107
We are closed at this time and
will reopen on Monday at 9:00.

562
01:06:02,702 --> 01:06:04,662
- He wasn't there?
- No.

563
01:06:04,704 --> 01:06:06,831
I don't understand.
His stuff, his boat...

564
01:06:06,873 --> 01:06:10,626
- something must have been there.
- No no, nothing was there.

565
01:06:10,668 --> 01:06:12,670
It was like he never existed.

566
01:06:12,712 --> 01:06:15,214
There must be some explanation.

567
01:06:15,256 --> 01:06:17,759
Yeah.
Heck, I知 losing it,

568
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:20,303
that's the explanation.

569
01:06:21,596 --> 01:06:23,806
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

570
01:06:23,848 --> 01:06:25,933
Have you spoken to Robert?

571
01:06:25,975 --> 01:06:27,977
No. Maybe he was right

572
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:30,688
and I shouldn't have
gone off the medication.

573
01:06:30,730 --> 01:06:32,774
Rachel, just come home.

574
01:06:32,815 --> 01:06:35,902
Just get out of there
and come back.

575
01:06:35,943 --> 01:06:40,114
You know what?
Maybe I did imagine Angus.

576
01:06:40,698 --> 01:06:44,202
He seemed so perfect.

577
01:06:44,243 --> 01:06:46,829
And there isn't
anything that perfect.

578
01:06:46,871 --> 01:06:49,457
- Is there?
- Listen, I知 coming to you.

579
01:06:49,499 --> 01:06:50,958
I'll get on the next plane

580
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:53,377
and I値l be there in a few hours.

581
01:06:53,419 --> 01:06:55,713
You just sit tight.

582
01:06:55,755 --> 01:06:58,007
You stay there, okay?

583
01:06:58,049 --> 01:06:59,801
Okay.

584
01:06:59,842 --> 01:07:03,054
I'll see you soon.

585
01:10:06,696 --> 01:10:10,450
Rachel!
What are you doing here?

586
01:10:10,491 --> 01:10:13,619
I knew you'd be here!

587
01:10:15,955 --> 01:10:20,835
Rachel!
Come down
and meet me inside.

588
01:10:25,006 --> 01:10:27,967
Sharon, he's here... Angus.

589
01:10:28,009 --> 01:10:29,719
- What?
- He was on the balcony.

590
01:10:29,761 --> 01:10:32,221
I saw him, then I saw you,
and then he was gone.

591
01:10:32,263 --> 01:10:35,058
You didn't see him.
You didn't see anything.

592
01:10:35,099 --> 01:10:37,852
- Your mind is playing
tricks on you. - No no.

593
01:10:37,894 --> 01:10:40,980
- No.
- Come on, let's go home.

594
01:10:43,441 --> 01:10:45,985
Sharon, he's right there,
in the doorway.

595
01:10:46,027 --> 01:10:48,529
- There's no one there.
- Turn around.

596
01:10:48,571 --> 01:10:50,198
I am not gonna turn around.

597
01:10:50,239 --> 01:10:51,949
I'm not buying into this fantasy.

598
01:10:51,991 --> 01:10:54,243
There's nobody there.

599
01:10:54,285 --> 01:10:56,537
Listen to me.

600
01:10:56,579 --> 01:10:58,831
I want you to do something for me.

601
01:10:58,873 --> 01:11:01,250
Close your eyes.
Do this.

602
01:11:01,292 --> 01:11:03,920
Close your eyes
and when you open them again,

603
01:11:03,961 --> 01:11:07,006
he'll be gone.
You have to do this.

604
01:11:07,048 --> 01:11:11,844
You make him go away
now,
and he'll never come back again.

605
01:11:11,886 --> 01:11:14,931
Close your eyes.

606
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:17,975
Close your eyes.

607
01:11:18,017 --> 01:11:21,396
And now he'll be gone.

608
01:11:26,984 --> 01:11:29,529
He's coming towards us.

609
01:11:33,324 --> 01:11:36,202
He's right behind you.

610
01:11:38,079 --> 01:11:40,123
See?

611
01:11:40,164 --> 01:11:42,166
Nothing.

612
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,127
Nothing.

613
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:48,339
Can we go now?

614
01:12:11,237 --> 01:12:14,824
Legs, 11.
We have legs, 11.

615
01:12:14,866 --> 01:12:18,619
Now what about 1 and 6?
It's sweet 16.

616
01:12:18,661 --> 01:12:22,331
We'll not see that again,
will we?

617
01:12:22,373 --> 01:12:26,461
And the next number is 88...
two fat ladies.

618
01:12:26,502 --> 01:12:28,838
Bingo, bingo!

619
01:12:28,873 --> 01:12:31,174
Where's Finlay?

620
01:12:33,092 --> 01:12:35,219
Is he in here?

621
01:12:39,182 --> 01:12:42,101
Would you come with me? I want
you to come with me right now.

622
01:12:42,143 --> 01:12:45,354
What are you talking about?
I can't come with you.

623
01:12:45,396 --> 01:12:47,732
Rachel, what are you doing?

624
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:10,213
He stabbed her right here.

625
01:13:10,254 --> 01:13:14,258
So there'd be blood everywhere.

626
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:17,011
She was right here.

627
01:13:17,678 --> 01:13:20,515
Well, she's not here now.

628
01:13:21,599 --> 01:13:24,060
Come on, let's go.

629
01:13:25,728 --> 01:13:28,022
She was here.

630
01:13:30,441 --> 01:13:33,611
We need to do something.
Get more police here.

631
01:13:33,653 --> 01:13:35,071
I'm not taking
anyone else out there.

632
01:13:35,113 --> 01:13:38,324
I'm telling you,
someone must have moved the body.

633
01:13:38,366 --> 01:13:39,742
Rachel, Rachel.

634
01:13:39,784 --> 01:13:42,245
I want you to listen to me.

635
01:13:42,286 --> 01:13:44,705
Angus McCulloch is dead.

636
01:13:44,747 --> 01:13:47,959
And I値l bet your friend
is at home right now

637
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:52,255
reading the newspaper
and eating scones.

638
01:14:09,731 --> 01:14:13,359
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after the beep.

639
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:17,530
She's not there.

640
01:14:17,572 --> 01:14:20,804
Yes, but that doesn't
mean she came up here.

641
01:14:20,839 --> 01:14:24,036
Wherever she is, I知 sure
she's absolutely fine.

642
01:14:27,832 --> 01:14:29,834
I want you to spend tonight

643
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:31,377
with Mary and me.

644
01:14:31,419 --> 01:14:34,464
I don't think
you should be alone.

645
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,677
What do you think,
I知 making this up?

646
01:14:39,719 --> 01:14:42,638
Nobody's out to get you.

647
01:14:43,473 --> 01:14:46,267
Listen,
if this was one of your books,

648
01:14:46,309 --> 01:14:47,852
which would you believe?

649
01:14:47,894 --> 01:14:50,271
That the heroine fell in love

650
01:14:50,313 --> 01:14:54,484
with a ghost who
then murdered her best friend,

651
01:14:54,525 --> 01:14:56,444
or...

652
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:00,156
that she imagined it

653
01:15:00,198 --> 01:15:02,492
and she needs some help?

654
01:15:05,828 --> 01:15:08,748
I'm not crazy.

655
01:15:11,042 --> 01:15:12,877
Weli...

656
01:15:12,919 --> 01:15:14,545
the offer's there.

657
01:15:14,587 --> 01:15:18,257
I'm at the other end of the phone.

658
01:15:20,843 --> 01:15:24,514
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after the beep.

659
01:15:24,555 --> 01:15:27,016
Hi, it's me.

660
01:15:27,058 --> 01:15:29,435
I don't know where you are.

661
01:15:29,477 --> 01:15:31,854
I don't know if you came out here.

662
01:15:31,896 --> 01:15:33,523
I don't know what's going on,

663
01:15:33,564 --> 01:15:38,820
but if you could call me
when you get this...

664
01:15:38,861 --> 01:15:40,738
okay?

665
01:15:42,657 --> 01:15:46,244
Hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message after...

666
01:15:46,285 --> 01:15:49,872
hi, it's Sharon.
Leave a message a...

667
01:15:49,914 --> 01:15:51,833
leave a message
after the beep.

668
01:15:51,874 --> 01:15:55,044
Leave a mes...

669
01:16:01,509 --> 01:16:05,471
Dr. Freedman, table for four.

670
01:16:05,513 --> 01:16:06,347
This way, sir.

671
01:16:06,389 --> 01:16:09,100
- Hello.
Robert, it's me.

672
01:16:09,142 --> 01:16:11,436
Rachel, listen,
I知 just in a restaurant,

673
01:16:11,477 --> 01:16:13,563
- can I call you back?
- No no no.

674
01:16:13,604 --> 01:16:17,233
Listen, I don't know
how to explain this,

675
01:16:17,275 --> 01:16:20,903
but I think that Sharon
came out here

676
01:16:20,945 --> 01:16:23,531
and that she may have been hurt.

677
01:16:23,573 --> 01:16:26,075
What?
What are you talking about?

678
01:16:26,117 --> 01:16:28,473
I need you to do me a favor,
okay?

679
01:16:28,508 --> 01:16:30,830
Rachel, slow down.
What's happening?

680
01:16:30,872 --> 01:16:34,959
I don't know what's happening.
That's just it.

681
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:39,338
Can you please just
go to Sharon's?

682
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:42,300
She's not answering
her phone or her cell.

683
01:16:42,341 --> 01:16:43,760
What for?

684
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:45,928
I just need you
to go there, okay?

685
01:16:45,970 --> 01:16:47,805
And then call me, okay?

686
01:16:47,847 --> 01:16:49,265
Well, why shouldn't she be there?

687
01:16:49,307 --> 01:16:53,019
Look, I just need you to
go there and then call me.

688
01:16:53,061 --> 01:16:54,479
Listen, Rachel,
can't this wait?

689
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,981
- I've got friends here.
We're about to... - no.

690
01:16:57,023 --> 01:17:00,359
Please, can you just
do this for me? Okay?

691
01:17:00,401 --> 01:17:03,696
Okay. I'll go there,
and I値l call you.

692
01:17:03,738 --> 01:17:06,741
Okay, I知 gonna
be waiting.

693
01:17:06,783 --> 01:17:08,868
Okay.

694
01:17:13,039 --> 01:17:17,043
All right, sorry about that.
Thanks very much.

695
01:17:17,085 --> 01:17:19,253
Thank you. Okay.

696
01:18:06,718 --> 01:18:10,054
I need to talk to you.

697
01:18:10,096 --> 01:18:12,265
Come in.

698
01:18:13,933 --> 01:18:16,644
The Scots call it
"da-shealladh."

699
01:18:16,686 --> 01:18:18,730
"Second sight."

700
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:20,773
It's been my ruin.

701
01:18:21,858 --> 01:18:24,944
You think the living
are full of regrets?

702
01:18:24,986 --> 01:18:28,364
You ought to hear the dead
endlessly lamenting.

703
01:18:28,406 --> 01:18:32,368
"Never made up with my children."

704
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,787
"Ignored my parents."

705
01:18:34,829 --> 01:18:36,998
"Never told anyone I love them."

706
01:18:37,039 --> 01:18:41,043
This isn't some kind
of game, is it?

707
01:18:41,085 --> 01:18:45,048
I mean, you just
wouldn't make this up.

708
01:18:45,089 --> 01:18:47,884
My son drowned.

709
01:18:47,925 --> 01:18:51,596
I just want to
know that you...

710
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:55,600
that this isn't something
you would take lightly.

711
01:18:55,641 --> 01:18:58,352
He follows you everywhere.

712
01:18:58,394 --> 01:19:01,105
He's trying to warn you.

713
01:19:01,147 --> 01:19:04,692
About what? What?

714
01:19:04,734 --> 01:19:06,402
Angus?

715
01:19:06,444 --> 01:19:07,695
What are you saying?

716
01:19:07,737 --> 01:19:10,865
- Are you saying he's not dead?
- Oh, he's dead.

717
01:19:10,907 --> 01:19:13,993
His ghost's out there
wandering the island.

718
01:19:14,035 --> 01:19:16,245
Suicides are
forever trapped

719
01:19:16,287 --> 01:19:18,414
between our world and the next.

720
01:19:18,456 --> 01:19:22,168
When I cross, I don't want
anything on my conscience.

721
01:19:22,210 --> 01:19:25,129
Don't go back to the island.

722
01:19:25,171 --> 01:19:27,131
Leave Ingonish cove tonight.
Your life's in danger.

723
01:19:27,173 --> 01:19:31,052
That's what Thomas has
come back to tell you.

724
01:19:31,094 --> 01:19:34,972
I have to go back to
get Thomas's things.

725
01:19:35,014 --> 01:19:37,058
Well, do it quickly.

726
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:49,695
Would you like some of mine?

727
01:19:49,737 --> 01:19:52,532
Yeah, one second. Hello.

728
01:19:52,573 --> 01:19:56,702
- Have you gone to Sharon's?
- I called her.
She's not answering.

729
01:19:56,744 --> 01:20:00,915
What's this
all about?

730
01:20:01,833 --> 01:20:06,504
- Would you excuse me a second?
- Yeah, sure.

731
01:20:06,546 --> 01:20:08,131
Can I try a bit?

732
01:20:08,172 --> 01:20:09,716
Are you awake?

733
01:20:09,757 --> 01:20:12,176
Robert.
What a surprise.

734
01:20:12,218 --> 01:20:15,138
I'm sorry to call you so late.
Do you have a second?

735
01:20:15,179 --> 01:20:18,057
Yes, I知 just doing a little
late-night editing.

736
01:20:18,099 --> 01:20:22,770
- What's going on?
- Something strange is
going on with Rachel.

737
01:20:22,812 --> 01:20:23,855
She's called me twice.

738
01:20:23,896 --> 01:20:27,024
She's going on about Sharon
being hurt somehow.

739
01:20:27,066 --> 01:20:28,651
She's not
making sense.

740
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:31,612
I knew she shouldn't have
gone out there by herself.

741
01:20:31,654 --> 01:20:34,532
You don't think she's gonna
do anything stupid, do you?

742
01:20:34,574 --> 01:20:37,577
The way she sounded,
nothing would surprise me.

743
01:20:37,618 --> 01:20:40,204
Christ.

744
01:20:40,246 --> 01:20:43,583
I-I was worried about this.

745
01:20:43,624 --> 01:20:45,168
Well, listen,
I知 gonna call her now.

746
01:20:45,209 --> 01:20:48,463
I think you should,
and get Sharon to also.

747
01:20:48,504 --> 01:20:50,631
Yes, of course, of course.

748
01:20:50,673 --> 01:20:52,759
Well, thanks for calling.

749
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:57,221
Okay, tell me how it goes.
I hope everything's okay.

750
01:20:57,263 --> 01:20:59,515
Yes, I will.

751
01:22:02,078 --> 01:22:04,455
Back from the dead?

752
01:22:10,044 --> 01:22:12,588
You look good for a corpse.

753
01:22:25,560 --> 01:22:26,853
Where's the rest
of it?

754
01:22:26,894 --> 01:22:31,190
- You get it when we get it.
- Well, my price just doubled.

755
01:22:33,151 --> 01:22:34,819
Four million,

756
01:22:34,861 --> 01:22:37,613
slightly more than you told me.

757
01:22:39,073 --> 01:22:42,326
Do you know what the funny
thing about you and Brian is?

758
01:22:42,368 --> 01:22:45,955
You always talk about him.

759
01:22:45,997 --> 01:22:49,959
All the ways the two
of you are going to...

760
01:22:50,001 --> 01:22:51,961
enjoy the money.

761
01:22:52,003 --> 01:22:53,963
But Brian,

762
01:22:54,005 --> 01:22:56,090
he never talks about the money,

763
01:22:56,132 --> 01:22:58,092
and he never talks about you.

764
01:22:58,134 --> 01:23:00,011
He always talks about her.

765
01:23:00,053 --> 01:23:04,515
Her books, her success,
her imagination.

766
01:23:04,557 --> 01:23:08,269
It's envy of her... isn't it?

767
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:11,981
That brought you two together?

768
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:20,656
You both just want to be her.

769
01:23:21,532 --> 01:23:24,952
The ghost has a heart, huh?

770
01:23:24,994 --> 01:23:26,996
Is that why you were
on the balcony?

771
01:23:27,038 --> 01:23:30,166
You were meant to be downstairs.

772
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:33,461
Tonight?
I wasn't on the balcony.

773
01:23:33,503 --> 01:23:36,756
I was downstairs the whole time.

774
01:23:36,798 --> 01:23:38,758
And besides,

775
01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:41,219
you're the ones who
have been improvising.

776
01:23:41,260 --> 01:23:45,098
What's with all the messages
from her dead kid?

777
01:23:45,139 --> 01:23:47,141
We never did that.

778
01:23:47,183 --> 01:23:50,228
Good idea, though.
But we never did it.

779
01:23:53,147 --> 01:23:55,900
How do you get your
hands on the money?

780
01:23:55,942 --> 01:23:58,653
I thought you were
the guy who never asked.

781
01:23:58,694 --> 01:24:01,280
"I do the job. They pay me.

782
01:24:01,322 --> 01:24:02,782
I go home."

783
01:24:02,824 --> 01:24:07,078
You did the job, so go home.

784
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:11,624
You didn't fall for her,
did you, Patrick,

785
01:24:11,666 --> 01:24:16,629
while you were pretending to
fall for her?

786
01:24:16,664 --> 01:24:21,592
Your whole life may
have just collapsed.

787
01:24:26,431 --> 01:24:29,642
Do you remember

788
01:24:29,684 --> 01:24:32,437
what I was doing

789
01:24:32,478 --> 01:24:35,231
when we first met?

790
01:24:38,693 --> 01:24:40,528
Yeah.

791
01:24:40,570 --> 01:24:43,030
I thought you might.

792
01:24:45,408 --> 01:24:48,369
I want the rest of the money.

793
01:24:50,413 --> 01:24:53,249
I won't tell you again.

794
01:25:01,799 --> 01:25:03,926
Sharon.

795
01:25:05,845 --> 01:25:10,975
It was a pleasure killing you.

796
01:26:21,713 --> 01:26:24,090
All aboard!

797
01:26:24,132 --> 01:26:27,218
Sir!

798
01:26:28,469 --> 01:26:30,888
All aboard!

799
01:30:11,234 --> 01:30:14,112
I love these.

800
01:30:17,407 --> 01:30:21,744
Do you know the old
Celtic legend about them?

801
01:30:22,745 --> 01:30:28,209
First, we have
to bury it together.

802
01:30:29,419 --> 01:30:31,713
Together.

803
01:30:49,188 --> 01:30:52,608
And then if one
of us ever returns

804
01:30:52,650 --> 01:30:55,695
and digs it up, then...

805
01:30:55,737 --> 01:30:59,282
Then we
were meant for each other?

806
01:30:59,323 --> 01:31:03,870
Well, actually, I don't know
because I just made it up.

807
01:32:02,387 --> 01:32:04,764
Rachel.

808
01:33:20,673 --> 01:33:22,675
Just room for one more inside.

809
01:33:22,717 --> 01:33:25,887
So there was nothing at all
out there on the island?

810
01:33:25,928 --> 01:33:28,889
No,
poor girl must be crazy.

811
01:33:28,924 --> 01:33:31,851
She's got "ghosts
in the attic."

812
01:33:32,894 --> 01:33:35,772
Hey, I love this bit.
It's great.

813
01:33:35,813 --> 01:33:39,317
This is where Hugo
the dummy comes alive.

814
01:33:40,985 --> 01:33:45,698
It's nearly midnight.

815
01:33:51,871 --> 01:33:54,457
- Finlay, I need your help
out on the island.
- For god's sake.

816
01:33:54,499 --> 01:33:57,210
Rachel's in danger.
It might be too late already.

817
01:33:57,251 --> 01:33:59,962
It's very late tonight.
You come back in the morning.

818
01:34:00,004 --> 01:34:01,297
Finlay, please,
I need your help...

819
01:34:01,339 --> 01:34:06,552
Finlay. The last time she tried
to warn us about something,

820
01:34:06,594 --> 01:34:08,596
we all ignored her.

821
01:34:08,638 --> 01:34:12,934
And we had three funerals
the next Sunday.

822
01:34:40,962 --> 01:34:43,715
Brian, wait.
- Look, relax.

823
01:34:43,756 --> 01:34:46,926
Everything's gone perfectly.

824
01:34:46,968 --> 01:34:50,054
Everyone thinks she's crazy...

825
01:34:50,096 --> 01:34:54,475
the whole village,
even her own shrink.

826
01:34:54,517 --> 01:34:56,978
She's in love with a ghost.

827
01:34:57,019 --> 01:34:59,981
She sees murders
that don't happen.

828
01:35:02,817 --> 01:35:03,943
No one...

829
01:35:03,985 --> 01:35:07,405
no one's gonna blink an
eye when she kills herself.

830
01:35:11,367 --> 01:35:16,414
Then her grieving
husband inherits 4 million.

831
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,252
And you thought

832
01:35:21,294 --> 01:35:24,047
I had no imagination.

833
01:35:36,350 --> 01:35:38,269
Just in case
she loses courage,

834
01:35:38,311 --> 01:35:42,482
just in case she wants to save
herself at the last moment...

835
01:35:45,401 --> 01:35:48,738
she throws the key
out of reach.

836
01:35:56,037 --> 01:36:00,249
- Throws the anchor overboard.
- Wait!

837
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:04,504
- What?
- There's someone out there.

838
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:14,097
Did you see Patrick
get on the train?

839
01:36:14,138 --> 01:36:16,057
No.

840
01:36:16,099 --> 01:36:18,976
It's gotta be him.

841
01:36:20,019 --> 01:36:22,855
What's he doing?

842
01:36:22,897 --> 01:36:25,691
I don't know.

843
01:36:25,733 --> 01:36:29,153
We've gone too far
to stop now.

844
01:36:41,916 --> 01:36:44,460
Brian, she's awake.

845
01:37:16,784 --> 01:37:18,995
Don't look.

846
01:37:19,036 --> 01:37:21,247
Don't look.

847
01:37:23,624 --> 01:37:25,168
It's over.

848
01:37:25,209 --> 01:37:28,796
We've gotta see about Patrick.

849
01:38:13,925 --> 01:38:18,888
Don't forget
look behind you.

850
01:38:48,751 --> 01:38:51,170
He's not here.

851
01:38:51,212 --> 01:38:54,215
This place gives me the creeps.

852
01:38:54,257 --> 01:38:56,300
What if Patrick was
telling the truth?

853
01:38:56,342 --> 01:38:58,928
What if he wasn't
on the balcony?

854
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:03,725
Remember all those sailors
who said they saw Angus's
ghost on the island.

855
01:39:03,766 --> 01:39:07,270
Yeah, drunk Scot sailors...

856
01:39:07,311 --> 01:39:09,939
very reliable.

857
01:39:09,981 --> 01:39:13,568
He's not here.
Let's go.

858
01:39:16,070 --> 01:39:19,240
Start tying yourself up!

859
01:39:44,348 --> 01:39:48,352
This isn't one of
your stories, Rachel.

860
01:39:51,647 --> 01:39:54,358
There's not gonna be
a happy ending.

861
01:40:16,089 --> 01:40:18,216
Patrick.

862
01:40:19,717 --> 01:40:24,347
No, not Patrick.

863
01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:40,381
No!

864
01:43:17,145 --> 01:43:21,357
It's better this way,
you know?

865
01:43:21,399 --> 01:43:23,401
Thank you.

866
01:43:23,443 --> 01:43:27,238
We'll keep people
off the island.

867
01:43:27,280 --> 01:43:31,033
Maybe then Angus
can rest in peace.

868
01:43:31,075 --> 01:43:33,244
You ready?

869
01:43:45,548 --> 01:43:48,509
Do you know what
Thomas would've wanted?

870
01:43:49,510 --> 01:43:51,804
Let go of his death.

871
01:43:51,846 --> 01:43:54,140
Remember his life.
