1
00:00:43,708 --> 00:00:46,000
Take off these cuffs!

2
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:55,708
Think you can shut me up?

3
00:00:55,792 --> 00:00:59,125
Fuck you! Remove the cuffs, fag!

4
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:03,208
I'll remember you, fags!

5
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,625
Easy.

6
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,917
Don't touch me. Raise your hands.

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
I can walk alone.

8
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,958
Fuck you, asshole!

9
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,625
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:21,458
First, take off the handcuffs.

11
00:01:21,583 --> 00:01:25,125
Take them off or I'm not coming in.

12
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:29,125
You think I'm stupid?
Take off the handcuffs!

13
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:44,875
Malik, can you hear me?

14
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:49,792
- Do you understand?
- I understand it's 6 years.

15
00:01:49,958 --> 00:01:52,167
Now you're an adult.
You'll be in a prison.

16
00:01:52,958 --> 00:01:54,500
You're among the adults.

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:00,458
Sign here.

18
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,917
- What's this?
- For legal aid.

19
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:06,250
- Money?
- Money for me.

20
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:08,625
So they pay me. Sign here.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,042
Money for you?

22
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,625
Thank you.

23
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,458
Raise your arms.

24
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,458
Higher.

25
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,417
Palms out.
Shake your hair.

26
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,875
Open your mouth.
Stick out your tongue.

27
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,542
Turn.

28
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:35,167
The soles of your feet.
The other one.

29
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,042
Bend over.

30
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:38,042
Cough.

31
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:46,125
Money is not allowed here.
You'll get it when you leave.

32
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:51,542
Give him a uniform and shoes.
Rubbish. You can't wear them here.

33
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,708
- Do you have a family?
- No, sir.

34
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:58,083
- Somebody to send you money?
- No, sir.

35
00:03:58,417 --> 00:04:00,458
Friends or enemies in here?

36
00:04:01,417 --> 00:04:02,542
No, sir.

37
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:08,042
You'll be in observation.
So we can evaluate you.

38
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:10,250
We'll see how you adapt.

39
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,667
Then you'll have a permanent cell.

40
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,458
- Are you a practicing believer?
- What?

41
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,292
Your religion.

42
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:19,542
Will you pray?

43
00:04:20,542 --> 00:04:22,125
Any special diet?

44
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,667
Nothing special, sir.

45
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,000
Do you eat pork?

46
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,292
No. Yes..

47
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:34,042
How will you receive any money sent?

48
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,708
I don't know.

49
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:37,833
Want to work?

50
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:44,750
- What do you do besides
attacking policemen?
- I did nothing!

51
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,000
Vocational training?
Anything else?

52
00:04:55,083 --> 00:04:56,708
Stand back, please.

53
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:19,458
Boss!

54
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:59,167
Are you new?
You're in the office.

55
00:07:00,042 --> 00:07:01,333
Did you get something from outside?

56
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,833
- A mobile, drugs, pills?
- What the hell? I have nothing.

57
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,125
Do you get checks?
Do you have friends outside?

58
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:14,042
- What do you want?
- Your shoes. They're nice.

59
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,333
Can I keep them?
Take my slippers.

60
00:07:16,417 --> 00:07:17,708
Fuck you.

61
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,250
Faggot!

62
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:56,708
Son of a bitch.

63
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,333
To your cells. Closing time.

64
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,833
Closing time.

65
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,917
Line up.

66
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:37,417
Cesar.

67
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,250
Call Cesar.

68
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,792
The guy on the right.

69
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:54,542
- What's that dirty Arab doing here?
- Could be for the Farraldo trial.

70
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,958
Luciani. Ward.

71
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,250
Luciani. Consultation.

72
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,208
So?

73
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,625
They've brought him
for the Farraldo trial.

74
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,750
His lawyer wants to negotiate.
Get a lesser sentence.

75
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,542
He will stay until the trial.

76
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:05,167
Jacky Marcaggi wants you to do him.

77
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,000
- When is the trial?
- On the 14.

78
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:14,458
In ten days? Not much time.

79
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:18,833
- Does he suspect anything?
- The usual.

80
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,625
Like any rat. He's asked for a
transfer to the Muslim section.

81
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:27,292
And if left alone,
we lose our chance.

82
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:42,917
Stays all day in the cell. Doesn't see
anyone. Never goes out. Doesn't eat.

83
00:10:44,042 --> 00:10:47,375
He requested block B,
with the Muslims.

84
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:52,542
We have to get him
while he's in the cell.

85
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:57,292
- Hit and run?
- We can't risk one of our own.

86
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:01,625
Stay tuned. We'll find a
way. Any contact in block A?

87
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,167
Just the porter.

88
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:06,750
Open. Dinner!

89
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:11,542
- The door must always be open.
- Yes, I know.

90
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:15,333
- Nothing to eat?
- No, just bread.
- Bread, then.

91
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,458
The other.

92
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:22,083
Bon appétit.

93
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,875
- When is there mail?
- Tomorrow.

94
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,625
- How you doing?
- Okay.

95
00:11:34,417 --> 00:11:35,500
Bread?

96
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,750
Bon appétit.

97
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:12,375
- What the fuck?
- I recognized you. We're neighbors.

98
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,625
- What's your name?
- Yours?

99
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:21,167
- Which block are you in?
- Do you know yours?

100
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,750
B.

101
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,667
Ask for the B.
It is for our brothers.

102
00:12:27,833 --> 00:12:31,833
Come closer.
I said come closer.

103
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:37,542
You want hashish?
Yeah, hashish. Want some or not?

104
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,875
But.. I have no money.

105
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:43,542
- We'll manage.
- What do you mean?

106
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:46,708
I'll bribe a guard and you suck me.

107
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:50,708
- What?
- You suck me off.
- Fuck you, asshole!

108
00:12:50,792 --> 00:12:55,000
Me, suck? Mother fucker! Fuck you!

109
00:12:55,917 --> 00:12:58,542
Shut up! Faggot!

110
00:13:49,083 --> 00:13:50,167
Are you okay?

111
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:52,667
I found it in the yard.

112
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,333
This way.

113
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:36,625
- How old are you?
- 19. Why?

114
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:40,833
- Don't look at me. Look at this guy.
- Look at me.

115
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:44,875
I heard you got 6 years.
It's a long time.

116
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,125
Think you can last
without protection?

117
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,750
I'll manage.

118
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:54,917
- What do you want?
- To protect you.

119
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,875
- Do you speak Arabic?
- Sure.

120
00:14:58,292 --> 00:14:59,875
The guy in the shower yesterday..

121
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,125
You know him?

122
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:05,417
What did he want?

123
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
To talk.

124
00:15:08,792 --> 00:15:10,083
I told you not to look at me.

125
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:12,625
I want you to go on with him.

126
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,708
Get close to him.
Become his friend.

127
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,417
Why?

128
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,500
Because you're going to kill him.
Let him go.

129
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,583
Come closer.

130
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:26,750
Closer. Near to him.

131
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,125
You can do it.

132
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,375
You're not alone.
We'll help.

133
00:15:36,708 --> 00:15:37,958
But remember something.

134
00:15:39,167 --> 00:15:44,000
Now that you know, either you
kill him, or I'll kill you.

135
00:15:45,292 --> 00:15:46,542
Go on, now.

136
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,458
Understood?

137
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,250
Kill him and be quiet. Understood?

138
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,167
I can't kill anyone.

139
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,750
- Yes?
- Can I speak with the director?

140
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,875
There is a procedure.
First you have to ask for an interview.

141
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,167
The guard..

142
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:41,208
Can I talk to the guard now?

143
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,375
- Why?
- I need to.

144
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:46,333
I'll check.

145
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,583
I have a problem, sir.

146
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:24,875
We give the orders. What do you want?
Nothing? Shut up and do as you're told.

147
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:54,250
Reyeb is careful.
He won't accept easily.

148
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,333
Are you listening?

149
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,708
- Once again. Are you paying attention?
- Yes

150
00:18:01,583 --> 00:18:06,167
It won't be easy.
You can't carry anything.

151
00:18:06,542 --> 00:18:10,125
Talk to him.. naturally.
About your mothers, visits..

152
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,250
Normal talk.

153
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,000
You cut here.

154
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,958
You hit him on the balls.

155
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,583
You grab his shoulder.

156
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,792
You get up and do it. Understood?

157
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,417
Can you give me some hash?

158
00:18:41,292 --> 00:18:42,375
I can't hear you.

159
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:45,750
Some hash.

160
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,417
Ok. I'll talk to the dealer.

161
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:50,958
Move away.

162
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,667
What?

163
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:54,417
Move away, I said.

164
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,000
Turn.

165
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,083
Turn.

166
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,875
Raise your hands.

167
00:20:31,792 --> 00:20:32,875
Guard!

168
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,500
Is it that one?

169
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,333
- El Djebena, move.
- Give us a minute.

170
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,042
Problems at work?

171
00:21:15,083 --> 00:21:17,458
- What did he do?
- He hit a guy.

172
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:19,875
Did you hit a guy?

173
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:22,750
What did he do to you?

174
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:25,708
Nothing?

175
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:29,250
Nothing and you hit him?

176
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,750
You know what I think?

177
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,875
You did that to get caught.

178
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,125
Am I wrong?

179
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:41,833
You think we can't get to you
to do what we want?

180
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:44,167
Is that it?

181
00:21:47,792 --> 00:21:48,958
Bitch!

182
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:51,333
Piece of shit!

183
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,042
Asshole!

184
00:21:53,417 --> 00:21:54,375
Enough, Cesar!

185
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,625
Stop, Cesar! Enough!

186
00:22:09,417 --> 00:22:11,083
He'll bleed a lot, so be careful.

187
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:14,750
Check the soles of your shoes.

188
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:18,333
Leave the blade in his hand.

189
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:24,667
Your turn. You're the girl.

190
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,167
Fast or it won't work.

191
00:22:48,792 --> 00:22:49,583
Come on.

192
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:58,708
That's right. Fine.

193
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,458
Come on.

194
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:15,500
Come in. Don't move.

195
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:25,083
Raise your hands.
I said hands up.

196
00:24:27,583 --> 00:24:29,292
Sorry, but not everyone
is a friend here.

197
00:24:35,583 --> 00:24:36,833
I decide.

198
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:41,167
Sit.

199
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,083
On the bed.
On the bed I said.

200
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,000
You want something?
Water? Coffee?

201
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:52,625
Coffee.

202
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:05,625
- Are you interested in this?
- What?
- Books.

203
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:10,250
- You want to read?
- I don't know.

204
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,375
Don't know what?

205
00:25:13,792 --> 00:25:14,833
You can't read, right?

206
00:25:16,875 --> 00:25:19,917
it's never too late.
There is a school in prison.

207
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:22,083
You can learn here.

208
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:25,833
Sugar?

209
00:25:29,417 --> 00:25:31,458
The idea is to get out of here
a little smarter.

210
00:25:53,708 --> 00:25:54,667
Here.

211
00:26:02,667 --> 00:26:06,125
I've seen you in the yard.
Always alone.

212
00:26:06,417 --> 00:26:11,250
Always wearing the same clothes.
Don't you have friends here? None?

213
00:26:14,167 --> 00:26:17,625
I'm just passing by. I won't stay.

214
00:26:18,375 --> 00:26:22,542
I can leave you some books.
You can learn to read.

215
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,250
Shut up!

216
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:38,292
Are you okay?

217
00:26:42,083 --> 00:26:43,000
Are you okay?

218
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:46,375
What are you doing?

219
00:26:48,292 --> 00:26:49,250
Come.

220
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:56,542
From Cesar Luciani.

221
00:29:57,625 --> 00:29:59,083
You are now under his protection.

222
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,542
I have seen your profile.
Almost empty.

223
00:30:44,958 --> 00:30:46,042
Are you interested?

224
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:49,958
Why didn't you fill it out, then?

225
00:30:51,167 --> 00:30:54,000
- I don't understand.
- Want to learn?

226
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,792
You wrote your name, so
you can write a little.

227
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:01,875
A little.

228
00:31:02,083 --> 00:31:05,250
- When did you leave school?
- At age 11.

229
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:08,958
Can you write "In" and "out"?

230
00:31:13,083 --> 00:31:14,625
Is your mother tongue French?

231
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:18,625
Did you talk in French
or Arabic to your parents?

232
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,958
- I wasn't raised by them.
- Did you speak French or Arabic first?

233
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,542
Both.

234
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:33,250
- Where was your school?
- A Youth Center.

235
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:38,125
There is a word with "a"
which is not pronounced "a".

236
00:31:38,708 --> 00:31:39,792
The fourth.

237
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:44,375
- The fourth. What is the word?
- "Dans".

238
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:50,417
Go to the second word.
The second word..

239
00:31:50,542 --> 00:31:52,167
"Canard".

240
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:57,000
This word has two syllables.

241
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,250
Ca..

242
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:00,792
..nard.

243
00:32:01,292 --> 00:32:05,500
Repeat, separating the syllables.

244
00:32:07,583 --> 00:32:08,583
Very good.

245
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:16,417
In the first syllable, "ca", is the "a"
at the beginning or the end?

246
00:33:40,542 --> 00:33:42,208
Happy birthday, brother.

247
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:50,042
1 year

248
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,583
Stop it!

249
00:34:33,083 --> 00:34:34,750
Have you no shame?

250
00:35:00,583 --> 00:35:02,292
Who are the leaders?

251
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:05,208
- You know them?
- Who?

252
00:35:05,333 --> 00:35:06,583
The Muslims.

253
00:35:11,875 --> 00:35:16,500
These fucking Arabs! Dogs
at least screw in silence.

254
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:31,750
3.40 Euros.

255
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:33,417
How much is that?

256
00:35:34,458 --> 00:35:35,792
In francs?

257
00:35:36,208 --> 00:35:37,458
Money is money.

258
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,583
20 francs?

259
00:35:40,875 --> 00:35:42,167
Pass the biscuits.

260
00:35:42,708 --> 00:35:46,583
- Can you buy me something?
- You cheated me the last time.

261
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:48,250
- Not true.
- Ask him.

262
00:35:48,458 --> 00:35:52,458
- What do you want?
- Soap, cereal and Coca-Cola.

263
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,917
- No Coke.
- Why?

264
00:35:54,042 --> 00:35:55,667
Not with my card.

265
00:35:55,833 --> 00:35:58,125
- But it's for me.
- Don't bust my balls!

266
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,625
Stop sponging.
Sponge your own people.

267
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:07,250
Or your friends out there.
It pisses me off that you're here.

268
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,500
He's not one of us.

269
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:14,667
Let him clean if you want. But he's
finished, so out he goes. Arab shit!

270
00:36:15,333 --> 00:36:16,792
Have you finished? Out.

271
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,375
Fuck them!

272
00:36:54,958 --> 00:36:57,542
Fuck you.
Arab shit!

273
00:37:10,625 --> 00:37:12,000
How much you got left?

274
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,208
Two more..

275
00:37:17,375 --> 00:37:19,125
3 years.

276
00:37:19,875 --> 00:37:20,833
What about you?

277
00:37:23,458 --> 00:37:24,708
"Rabia": Rage.

278
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,625
"Rabid": furious.

279
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:34,708
"Raccia"..

280
00:37:35,208 --> 00:37:36,458
To caw.

281
00:37:37,417 --> 00:37:38,625
Who cares?

282
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:40,542
"Radica": Root.

283
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,083
Electricity is like water
in a circuit.

284
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:10,042
Whatever the tube diameter
the flow is the same. Same here.

285
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,542
The current remains constant
1, 2 and 3.

286
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:18,917
You have to change "he" for "us".
Understand? "He ate before. "

287
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,500
"We ate earlier".

288
00:38:20,583 --> 00:38:24,917
the "we" is fine, but " to eat"..
What is the participle?

289
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:32,083
We had eaten.

290
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:35,958
Okay. Now in the indefinite past.

291
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,583
- We.. ate.
- Do people talk this way?

292
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:43,708
It's complicated. I don't,
but they use it.

293
00:38:45,417 --> 00:38:48,500
One day I saw an ad.
For a security guard.

294
00:38:48,542 --> 00:38:51,667
I had no dog. I bought
a second-hand one.

295
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,458
In my ignorance, I bought a Rottweiler.

296
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:59,333
You know how they are?
His name was Tyson.

297
00:38:59,375 --> 00:39:02,542
He came with a name: Tyson.
He was huge!

298
00:39:04,542 --> 00:39:07,917
You see this?
That was his butt.

299
00:39:07,917 --> 00:39:11,417
His poops were bigger than mine.

300
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:15,583
I went to work at a supermarket.

301
00:39:15,958 --> 00:39:21,000
I left the dog inside and
went to smoke a cigarette.

302
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,958
When I tried to enter again,
it was impossible.

303
00:39:25,417 --> 00:39:28,917
- He didn't recognize me.
- Your own dog?

304
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:32,417
He was mad. Tyson was a psychotic.

305
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:35,833
I went in and he pounced.

306
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:39,792
I panicked and pulled out the gun.
He grabbed me like that.

307
00:39:39,833 --> 00:39:46,000
I sprayed him with gas. No effect.
I ran away scared. What to do?

308
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,208
I left him inside.

309
00:39:49,417 --> 00:39:55,458
Three hours later the employees arrived.
I didn't know they used the back door.

310
00:39:55,708 --> 00:40:00,500
The dog had a field day.
He mauled them all.

311
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:06,083
He was like Karim in Block B.

312
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,458
- What are you doing here?
- Returning books.

313
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,583
Out. You come with me.

314
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:21,833
- Why are you with him?
- He's a brother.
- He's a Corsican!

315
00:40:24,333 --> 00:40:25,917
Dirty bastard!

316
00:40:25,958 --> 00:40:29,208
- Pig!
- You call me pig?

317
00:40:30,958 --> 00:40:32,042
Who is the pig?

318
00:40:32,792 --> 00:40:33,792
Me a pig?

319
00:40:35,083 --> 00:40:36,250
Me a pig?

320
00:40:36,292 --> 00:40:37,625
Let me go!

321
00:40:41,917 --> 00:40:42,875
This is not right!

322
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,625
This isn't Corsica.

323
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:47,167
You are being disrespectful.

324
00:40:54,417 --> 00:40:55,250
El Djebena!

325
00:40:57,792 --> 00:41:00,167
Tell your boss I have to
introduce a new one.

326
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:10,000
- You bring the papers?
- They haven't arrived. I bring clothes.

327
00:41:10,708 --> 00:41:14,042
- Make coffee.
- For everyone?

328
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:17,417
Did you see Ilbanez?

329
00:41:18,167 --> 00:41:20,792
He'll come later with the new prisoner.

330
00:41:34,833 --> 00:41:35,833
Luciani.

331
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,083
Vettori.

332
00:41:37,583 --> 00:41:39,417
- Antarro.
- Santi.

333
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,500
- Ceccaldi.
- Profundi.

334
00:41:41,542 --> 00:41:42,583
Mosconi.

335
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,625
Pilicci.

336
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,542
- Valpato.
- Corleoni.

337
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,292
El Djebena.

338
00:41:56,667 --> 00:42:02,333
The Minister said that Corsicans will
serve their sentences closer to home.

339
00:42:02,375 --> 00:42:05,250
The law will be published on Sunday.

340
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:11,500
This is due to the revaluation of
political prisoners sponsored by Sarkozy

341
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:16,583
Currently there are no comments
from the Corsican National Front.

342
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
Cesar!

343
00:42:28,542 --> 00:42:29,625
Are you there?

344
00:42:31,375 --> 00:42:36,125
Did you hear the news?
When are we leaving?

345
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:40,917
- When the bill is passed.
- Soon?

346
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,792
No idea.

347
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,917
Luciani. For Mr. Sampiero.

348
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,417
I can tell you who won't benefit.
Not you, you know that.

349
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:11,542
Neither Pilicci, Antarr nor Prof.
You fucked up bad.

350
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:16,375
"Fuck up" wasn't used back then.

351
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:20,792
Santi and Vettori are expecting
conditional freedom, so..

352
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:29,667
- Are you saying I'm going
to die alone here?
- Don't talk like that.

353
00:43:33,042 --> 00:43:35,625
You're not alone.
You have strength outside.

354
00:43:38,458 --> 00:43:39,708
And here?

355
00:43:41,458 --> 00:43:42,583
Here!

356
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:48,583
Guard! I already pinned three.
This is disrespectful. Seriously.

357
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,708
Do you work for the Imam Moussab?

358
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:54,417
He helps to rehabilitate sick prisoners.
He got me a job.

359
00:43:54,792 --> 00:43:58,667
I'm doing some work for him.
Some day I'll have a real job.

360
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:02,167
- Are you sick?
- That's why I got a pardon.

361
00:44:02,583 --> 00:44:03,667
Are you leaving this place?

362
00:44:07,958 --> 00:44:12,375
- Do you have AIDS?
- Of course not! Don't say that.
Are you crazy?

363
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:21,625
- What have you got?
- Cancer of the testicles.

364
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:27,667
- Cancer in the balls?
- Don't shout. Don't advertise it!

365
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:30,625
- Besides, I'm cured.
- Are you better then?

366
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,667
Thank God.

367
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:35,125
Does it hurt?

368
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:37,208
No.

369
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:40,333
Chemotherapy is what hurts.
You lose your hair.

370
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:43,333
You feel like you're 80.
You're always tired.

371
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,833
But thank God it's over.
I can even have kids.

372
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:55,292
- Here, for your balls, bro.
- It's welcome.

373
00:44:57,292 --> 00:44:59,917
- What's your sign?
- Cancer.

374
00:45:00,333 --> 00:45:04,175
Just kidding. I'm Aries.

375
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:11,667
See you, Cesar!

376
00:45:12,333 --> 00:45:13,708
Take care, friend!

377
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,750
We won't forget you, Cesar!

378
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:22,125
Be strong, Volfoni!
See you in Bastia!

379
00:46:14,458 --> 00:46:16,250
Got your phone?

380
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,583
Why don't you leave it with someone?

381
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:45,458
I speak Corsican.

382
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,750
I speak your language.

383
00:46:56,292 --> 00:47:01,125
Did you understand me when
I was on the phone?

384
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:03,125
You were talking to a layer.

385
00:47:04,083 --> 00:47:05,458
A what?

386
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:08,792
A lawyer?

387
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:15,583
- Who taught you?
- You.. and the others.

388
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:20,833
- Looking, listening.
- You mean spying?

389
00:47:20,875 --> 00:47:24,083
I didn't spy on you.
I've learned by listening.

390
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:30,292
You were here. If you weren't spying,
what were you doing? Having fun?

391
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,833
If I had been having fun,
I wouldn't have told you.

392
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:38,792
Why are you tellimg me, then?
Because the others have gone?

393
00:47:40,375 --> 00:47:45,500
Look at me, Arab. Because
the others are gone, right?

394
00:47:45,542 --> 00:47:46,667
Yes

395
00:47:49,208 --> 00:47:51,375
Does anyone else know?

396
00:47:58,708 --> 00:48:00,500
It has a life of its own.

397
00:48:01,292 --> 00:48:04,708
Come sit.
Get your ass here.

398
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:17,667
Keep it.

399
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,458
Keep it, but don't use it.

400
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:27,542
Not everyone is like Ilbanez.
If they find it, you're fucked.

401
00:48:28,875 --> 00:48:31,833
Go on with the cleaning,
washing clothes..

402
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:37,208
Ilbanez will transfer you to the
adjacent cell.

403
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,083
I'll have them make you a porter.

404
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:45,292
You'll get paid, you can buy stuff
and go anywhere.

405
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:51,083
You'll be my eyes and ears.

406
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:56,375
- What about the others?
- Who, my friends?

407
00:48:56,417 --> 00:48:58,917
Watch them as well.

408
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:06,583
Are you happy?
You look worried.

409
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:10,375
- I'm fine.
- Well, say so.

410
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:27,458
eyes and ears

411
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:44,042
- What did Cesar say?
- The lawyer will help your brother.

412
00:50:44,125 --> 00:50:46,750
He doesn't give a shit about my brother.

413
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:50,417
My wife left him 10 messages.
He never answered.

414
00:50:51,667 --> 00:50:56,083
As with Santi and Castelli.
No news. Nothing.

415
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,125
Play.

416
00:51:52,958 --> 00:51:53,875
Did you masturbate?

417
00:51:53,917 --> 00:51:57,292
Jordi, the Gypsy
I like porn movies in castles.

418
00:51:57,333 --> 00:52:01,750
The girls are prettier, cleaner.
How many times did you come?

419
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:08,042
- When?
- Fuck off. Who cares? Give me that.

420
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:12,583
Remember with the driver?
With his dick pointing to her pussy.

421
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,500
He fucks her from behind
and stuffs her ass.

422
00:52:17,333 --> 00:52:22,667
And she sucks off the blonde's husband!
Then she goes for a walk with her dog.

423
00:52:27,417 --> 00:52:32,333
I'll give you the rest tomorrow.
Do you make a lot dealing?

424
00:52:32,625 --> 00:52:36,333
No. Enough for shopping and my drugs.

425
00:52:36,792 --> 00:52:38,125
To purchase..

426
00:52:41,167 --> 00:52:43,000
Want to work with me?

427
00:52:46,292 --> 00:52:48,250
I don't understand your game.

428
00:52:48,292 --> 00:52:50,917
- It's not a game.
- You work for the Corsicans.

429
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:52,625
I work for me.

430
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:56,875
You don't know anybody in Block C.
You don't sell to just anyone.

431
00:53:08,042 --> 00:53:09,500
What will you do after you get out?

432
00:53:14,583 --> 00:53:19,292
- When you leave, what will you do?
- Don't know. Do you?

433
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:24,542
- Same as here, but big.
- Hash?

434
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:26,958
Yes, hash.

435
00:53:28,708 --> 00:53:32,667
But in large quantities.
Marbella-Paris, 3 cars.

436
00:53:32,875 --> 00:53:35,000
600 kilos per trip.

437
00:53:37,875 --> 00:53:39,208
You don't believe me?

438
00:53:40,625 --> 00:53:43,667
I was just trying to imagine 600 kilos.

439
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:49,542
Something like this.

440
00:53:51,417 --> 00:53:53,333
You see nothing beyond.

441
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,833
Got it.

442
00:54:56,667 --> 00:55:02,417
They died for no reason!
You killed them!

443
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,250
Do you still need me?

444
00:55:39,875 --> 00:55:43,750
- Do you know my business?
- You told me to stay out.
- Come on..

445
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:48,125
I don't know. Things with the Italians.
Casinos in the south.

446
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:51,500
What's wrong?

447
00:55:54,875 --> 00:55:59,292
- How long will you be in here?
- 3 years. Minus time for good behavior

448
00:55:59,333 --> 00:56:00,542
You did half, right?

449
00:56:02,875 --> 00:56:08,083
- You can get furloughs.
Did you request them?
- No, that's for my lawyer.

450
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,375
- Has he requested them?
- Why do you ask?

451
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:20,125
Ask for parole. I'll get you
priority treatment.

452
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:23,125
Meanwhile, you can get furloughs.

453
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:28,792
You go out for me, come back, I'll pay.
What do you say?

454
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:34,042
- What's the risk?
- No risk. The risk is in here.

455
00:56:48,250 --> 00:56:53,708
As soon as the judge considers the
case, he'll ask for more information,

456
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,875
and answer in 5 or 6 months.

457
00:56:56,917 --> 00:57:00,042
I mean an answer,
not necessarily positive.

458
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:06,333
Do you have a card with your number?

459
00:57:13,417 --> 00:57:15,708
I'll telephone a lawyer,
the name's Sampiero.

460
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:20,167
Give him what he asks.
Do as he says.

461
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:24,125
Present the case as soon as he
prepares it. He'll pay you.

462
00:57:24,958 --> 00:57:29,167
- What about the trial?
- Don't worry. He'll explain.

463
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:41,625
Who is he? Who are these guys?
Thugs?

464
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:46,958
You never told me about it. Do you know
I can get kicked out of here?

465
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:51,917
- It's not what I need.
- It's too late. You're in this.

466
00:57:53,917 --> 00:57:56,667
From now on you're a model prisoner.

467
00:57:56,708 --> 00:58:02,167
You're a porter.
Be the best one.

468
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:06,917
Study for your exams.
Antarro will keep the phone.

469
00:58:07,292 --> 00:58:12,208
- He'll suspect something.
- I'll tell him you pissed me off.

470
00:58:21,583 --> 00:58:25,417
Peace be with you. I was glad
to receive your letter.

471
00:58:25,458 --> 00:58:30,583
In the first place to hear from you.
And also to see your progress.

472
00:58:30,625 --> 00:58:35,042
You write like a professional and I'm
glad. At least I served some purpose.

473
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:39,042
Now I can tell you
it was not easy.

474
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:42,750
About your request,
I'll see what I can do.

475
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:46,333
I'll send a request to visit you.

476
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:48,167
Life here isn't easy.

477
00:58:50,125 --> 00:58:54,667
I will avoid saying that it's better
over there, but honestly it's tough.

478
00:58:54,708 --> 00:58:59,208
Djamila has a part-time job
and it's hell with the kid.

479
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:06,042
Imam Moussab's Center got
me a job as an operator.

480
00:59:06,083 --> 00:59:09,333
I get paid shit, but I
keep quiet and hang on.

481
00:59:09,750 --> 00:59:12,250
Keep your head up!
Your brother, Riyad.

482
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,250
For the girls, Martine,
and for the boys, Jean-Pierre.

483
00:59:16,708 --> 00:59:20,333
- A question.
- What's your name?
- Ryad Mnaili.

484
00:59:20,375 --> 00:59:24,833
You are Jean-Pierre. You already made
a mistake. Only two are allowed.

485
00:59:24,875 --> 00:59:27,917
Be careful, put your hand
under his head.

486
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:36,167
Issam.. this is Malik.
He's your godfather.

487
00:59:48,125 --> 00:59:51,583
It's a garage. The owner
agrees to hire you.

488
00:59:51,625 --> 00:59:54,042
He'll meet you in your day off.

489
00:59:55,208 --> 01:00:00,917
It's the guy who fixes the Imam's cars.
He's already hired other guys.

490
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:04,667
Do you know what you do for them?

491
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,458
Does it bother you?

492
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,000
I go out and they pay me. If it's risky
for you, just tell me.

493
01:00:13,042 --> 01:00:19,250
Risky? Are you crazy? I'm
rehabilitated. Aren't we rehabilitated?

494
01:00:23,458 --> 01:00:27,125
Outside of Paris there are radars.
Go slowly.

495
01:00:27,542 --> 01:00:30,542
Suddenly.. the car breaks down.

496
01:00:31,042 --> 01:00:34,458
It skids a bit. Where?

497
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:38,875
Near a gas station.
The guys get off and push.

498
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:43,292
Guess who shows up to help them?
Come on, guess.

499
01:00:43,375 --> 01:00:44,833
- Who?
- Guess!

500
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:48,250
- I have no idea.
- The Customs guy, the Customs!

501
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,583
100 kilos.
They confiscated 100 kilos.

502
01:01:23,333 --> 01:01:27,917
- What is the point then?
- You'll know. You know what I want.

503
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:31,417
This is a business.
Don't you smoke my hash every day?

504
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Are they going to screw me for
your booty? For some smokes?

505
01:01:36,917 --> 01:01:39,333
- Fuck you!
- Back to your cell.

506
01:01:39,375 --> 01:01:40,917
- My dessert, sir!
- Get inside!

507
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:48,208
What does the accusation say?

508
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:54,958
In view of the case, I have no objection
to grant furloughs to Mr. El Djebena.

509
01:01:55,625 --> 01:02:01,167
But he can't be out more than 12 hours,
and he has to go to the police station.

510
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:04,875
Thank you.
Do you have anything to add?

511
01:02:08,708 --> 01:02:10,125
Let the prisoner in.

512
01:02:10,167 --> 01:02:14,167
Hello, Mr. El Djebena.

513
01:02:15,167 --> 01:02:20,583
I authorize a furlough. You'll leave
at 7 am and must return by 7 pm.

514
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:48,750
That's disgusting.
Do something.

515
01:03:23,125 --> 01:03:24,167
The door.

516
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:28,167
- Have a good day.
- Good day, sir.

517
01:04:17,083 --> 01:04:19,125
Roll up the window.

518
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:35,375
Your phone. That's my number.
So you can find me.

519
01:04:36,667 --> 01:04:41,583
Want to meet Djamila?
She's alone.

520
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:44,167
Do you have a TV in your cell?

521
01:04:57,083 --> 01:04:59,750
- For a day?
- Until 7.

522
01:05:43,917 --> 01:05:47,708
- How is Cesar?
- He was fine yesterday.

523
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:51,583
You'll leave this someplace for us.

524
01:05:52,417 --> 01:05:54,542
- What then?
- You return.

525
01:05:55,625 --> 01:05:59,583
- Cesar says you don't ask questions.
- Cesar says you'll pay me.

526
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,000
Later, all right?

527
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:11,375
- What do we do?
- Wait until he returns.

528
01:06:11,625 --> 01:06:13,583
What if something goes wrong?

529
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:17,000
Who cares?

530
01:06:31,917 --> 01:06:33,667
In the middle of nowhere.

531
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:40,708
There, to the right. Here, here,
to the right. Get closer.

532
01:06:46,708 --> 01:06:48,500
There's a car in front.

533
01:07:11,792 --> 01:07:15,958
The messenger's an Arab!
Do I let him in?

534
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,500
What the fuck?

535
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,667
- Who are you?
- Malik El Djebena.

536
01:07:40,708 --> 01:07:43,208
- Who sent you?
- Luciani.

537
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:47,208
Luciani is in jail!
Who are you?

538
01:07:47,875 --> 01:07:49,167
I'm doing time with him.

539
01:07:50,458 --> 01:07:54,208
- Are you in jail or out?
- One day leave.

540
01:07:54,292 --> 01:08:00,458
- Do you work for those bums?
- Don't work for anyone. I work for me.

541
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:05,708
- Everything in there?
- Yes

542
01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,792
- Can I go now?
- Have you forgotten something?

543
01:08:11,542 --> 01:08:13,167
You don't know about the exchange?

544
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:28,792
Let's go.

545
01:08:46,208 --> 01:08:47,208
Shut up.

546
01:08:52,083 --> 01:08:54,042
Call Cesar..

547
01:08:56,417 --> 01:08:58,833
You have to call Cesar.

548
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,417
Hello. It's me.
I have a problem.

549
01:09:20,458 --> 01:09:23,208
I'm not alone.
I'm with Santi.

550
01:09:55,583 --> 01:10:01,708
- Calle de Madrid. They're waiting.
- We gotta go. Can you go back alone?

551
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:07,167
- Any message for Cesar?
- I'll call him. Be sure to arrive on time.

552
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:10,083
Maybe we'll work together again.

553
01:10:12,792 --> 01:10:14,708
- What?
- You know..

554
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:15,833
God!

555
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,000
- How much?
- 25 kilos.

556
01:12:23,583 --> 01:12:24,833
Take this too.

557
01:12:28,042 --> 01:12:29,000
5,000.

558
01:12:31,458 --> 01:12:36,917
€ 5,000.. and 25 kilos of hash?
All in a day?

559
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:40,458
We have guys to keep it and sell.
We'll supply them.

560
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:45,875
We use convoys and buy from
the source. The Gypsy has contacts.

561
01:12:45,917 --> 01:12:49,375
We need three large cars.
Paris-Marbella in one night.

562
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:54,500
The first car to explore.
The second carries the load.

563
01:12:54,542 --> 01:12:56,708
The third car as an escort.

564
01:12:57,292 --> 01:12:59,917
They stay in contact by phone all night.

565
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,000
Each car has an exit.

566
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:07,375
- Wait, I've never done this before.
- So what's the problem?

567
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:09,083
None.

568
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:15,917
You focus on the city, I do the prison.
I'll make deals with leaving prisoners.

569
01:13:16,708 --> 01:13:20,250
Jordi knows a trucker
who delivers to jails.

570
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:24,500
We invest half the money. We divide
the rest by 3. You, me and the Gypsy.

571
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:26,375
Okay.

572
01:13:26,583 --> 01:13:30,500
Put a part in my account.
The rest we'll see.

573
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:33,750
- What time is it?
- 6.45.

574
01:13:35,708 --> 01:13:39,375
Let me tell you something.

575
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:41,875
Come out whenever you want!

576
01:13:46,042 --> 01:13:47,875
- Be careful.
- You too.

577
01:13:51,167 --> 01:13:53,000
El Djebena Malik.
35-114T.

578
01:13:57,167 --> 01:13:59,375
- How was the test?
- Car repairs.

579
01:13:59,417 --> 01:14:02,333
- Do you like mechanics?
- Yes, definitely.

580
01:14:03,458 --> 01:14:04,750
I'm in rehab.

581
01:14:05,583 --> 01:14:06,667
Bend over.

582
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:08,583
Cough.

583
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:14,625
- Sampiero said we could do it again.
- What do you think?

584
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,833
- It's legal.
- You see?

585
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:24,625
- Who did you see after Sampiero?
- The friend who got me the garage.

586
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,708
Any problems?

587
01:14:29,042 --> 01:14:34,042
I'll make myself clear. Your
furloughs are mine. Period.

588
01:14:34,333 --> 01:14:38,167
- Here I am still your "Arab"?
- Yes, you do the dirty work.

589
01:14:49,875 --> 01:14:54,375
Put your names on the
top right and fold it.

590
01:14:54,833 --> 01:14:59,625
You have one hour for French.
Then we continue with Economics.

591
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,083
- Do we write here?
- Yes, directly on the test sheet.

592
01:15:10,722 --> 01:15:13,600
ECONOMICS

593
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:40,083
You!

594
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:43,667
I've heard about your mother.

595
01:16:08,542 --> 01:16:12,750
Gentlemen, go back.
We'll do the Economics test.

596
01:16:16,792 --> 01:16:19,500
- El Djebena.
- Good morning.

597
01:16:22,542 --> 01:16:24,792
- And the batteries?
- Large ones.

598
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,083
- Malik.
- Sophie.

599
01:17:17,417 --> 01:17:20,208
Am I crazy or do they multiply?

600
01:17:21,750 --> 01:17:24,042
Soon the carpets will come out.

601
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:30,208
We used to control the court.
Good thing they're dumb.

602
01:17:33,875 --> 01:17:39,375
If they'd stop thinking with
their balls, they'd evolve more.

603
01:17:41,083 --> 01:17:44,708
You should get closer
to see what's going on.

604
01:17:45,375 --> 01:17:46,708
I don't understand.

605
01:17:48,458 --> 01:17:50,000
What don't you understand?

606
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:57,292
- Want me to get a beating?
- Why would they beat you?

607
01:17:57,458 --> 01:18:03,625
- Are you crazy? To them I'm a Corsican.
- What? Their eyes are blinded by shit.

608
01:18:16,125 --> 01:18:21,917
Sends some guards to mingle with them.
They will eat from your hand.

609
01:18:23,583 --> 01:18:25,417
Good thinking.

610
01:18:27,208 --> 01:18:30,167
Just another Arab
thinking with his balls.

611
01:19:08,100 --> 01:19:10,267
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE

612
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:27,750
Let me introduce you to some friends.
The man in Marbella.

613
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:30,417
- This is Khalid!
- Your brother.

614
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:34,542
This is Mishka!

615
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,667
This is Damien. And here is Olivier.
Say hello to Malik.

616
01:19:39,083 --> 01:19:43,417
- What's your name?
- My name's Fernanda. And I love cocks.

617
01:19:49,625 --> 01:19:50,667
Marbella!

618
01:19:55,875 --> 01:20:02,083
There, in Block C. What are the
Muslims doing? Smuggling? Drugs?

619
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:07,125
- They do their own things.
- Really? You get nothing?

620
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:15,667
Don't you think it would be nice
to send a pair of strong guys?

621
01:20:15,708 --> 01:20:19,792
- Press them a little bit.
- Why press them?

622
01:20:20,167 --> 01:20:26,417
Why? To show them who's boss,
which hand they have to kiss.

623
01:20:26,917 --> 01:20:28,500
Isn't it obvious?

624
01:20:30,083 --> 01:20:34,750
Before you were 20. Now you're 5.
Can't you see the difference?

625
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:43,958
- What kind of difference?
- I can't do for 5 what I did for 20.

626
01:20:46,042 --> 01:20:51,292
If you can do nothing what good are you?
Want a transfer? I'll speak to Marcaggi.

627
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:53,292
- No, it's all right.
- What's all right?

628
01:20:53,542 --> 01:20:56,708
- I'll manage. I'll see what..
- You'll manage?

629
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:02,792
Use your head! Tomorrow you tell
me what you can do for me.

630
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:24,042
We have a problem, brother.

631
01:21:39,167 --> 01:21:43,750
- Make a petition. What can I say?
- Maybe Luciani can do something.

632
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:50,458
I don't understand. I was his lapdog
and now you ask me to lick your ass?

633
01:21:50,500 --> 01:21:53,167
Not for myself, for our brothers.

634
01:21:53,875 --> 01:21:58,208
To stop being his slave and be yours?

635
01:21:58,583 --> 01:22:00,708
If you want a favor, learn to ask.

636
01:22:03,042 --> 01:22:06,667
- What do you want?
- What could I want here?

637
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:09,375
- Respect.
- Do I look Corsican?

638
01:22:09,417 --> 01:22:14,750
- You think they trust you?
- I'll see what I can do.

639
01:22:34,625 --> 01:22:35,833
Luciani.

640
01:22:45,333 --> 01:22:51,417
- Now the meetings are here?
- It's cozy, warm, with a sea view.

641
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:53,542
- Sit down.
- I'm fine here.

642
01:22:55,083 --> 01:22:58,875
- So, what do you want?
- I have a problem in Marseille.

643
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:06,292
A cousin of yours, Brahim Lattrache.
I want you to pass a message.

644
01:23:07,333 --> 01:23:12,042
Tell him Luciani wants to talk
to him face to face, okay?

645
01:23:12,792 --> 01:23:18,667
- I'll see. What about the guards?
- I'll take care of that.

646
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,333
Brahim Lattrache in Marseille.

647
01:23:29,708 --> 01:23:34,208
See the guy in red? He'll go to the end,
turn around and start again.

648
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:42,958
The two that are running..
See the little guy with the hat?

649
01:23:43,417 --> 01:23:45,042
He'll do some push-ups.

650
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:53,750
Check the game.
Look at the hoop.

651
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:01,833
- Missed. Fuck him!
- No, the other.

652
01:24:09,708 --> 01:24:11,625
For me you see nothing?

653
01:24:16,167 --> 01:24:17,875
Yes.. snow.

654
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:39,542
Ok. I'll move aside.

655
01:24:42,042 --> 01:24:43,083
Fuck you..

656
01:24:44,917 --> 01:24:46,250
Quick, quick!

657
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:52,333
Ok

658
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:58,750
Latif, the Egyptian. They let a car
pass and then ambushed Riyad.

659
01:24:59,292 --> 01:25:01,000
He was caught with hash.

660
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:03,083
Now they want money.

661
01:25:04,083 --> 01:25:06,958
Who are those guys?
What do you know?

662
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:13,208
Nothing. I know their boss is called
Latif, the Egyptian. From the south.

663
01:25:13,750 --> 01:25:17,125
They use the same road.
They know the secrets.

664
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,917
What do we do?

665
01:25:23,792 --> 01:25:25,708
Give them what they ask.

666
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:28,625
Boss!

667
01:25:28,708 --> 01:25:33,458
- Any news of his friend?
- None. What should I do?
It's been 3 days..

668
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,083
Calm down! There are many people
here and we have hash.

669
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:41,042
If anyone knows the Egyptian
we'll know, don't worry.

670
01:25:41,583 --> 01:25:43,542
And he's going to hurt when I find him!

671
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:47,750
- How are you doing with the beards?
- Getting along.

672
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:51,167
Talk to them.. and investigate.

673
01:26:08,875 --> 01:26:11,292
- I need a favor.
- What is it?

674
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:16,292
- I need information about someone.
- Who? - A black, Latif, the Egyptian.

675
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:19,250
Latif? What can I do?

676
01:26:19,292 --> 01:26:23,583
- Tell me who he knows here.
- His brother-in-law.

677
01:26:31,958 --> 01:26:35,292
- What's the deal?
- Nothing. It's my business.

678
01:26:35,333 --> 01:26:36,083
See him?

679
01:26:38,167 --> 01:26:39,667
The one over there.

680
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:41,250
With the blue cap.

681
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:46,375
Are the other two with him?

682
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:49,333
- Seems that way.
- Will the Muslims help?

683
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:55,667
- They give us two guys. - No problem.
If we plan well, everything'll be fine.

684
01:27:25,792 --> 01:27:27,042
Shut up!

685
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:40,417
Boss! His ankle.
He needs a doctor.

686
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,333
Lights!

687
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:26,625
Mohammed Gaziler?
You know the Egyptian?

688
01:28:27,042 --> 01:28:29,000
- You know him?
- Yes

689
01:28:29,375 --> 01:28:30,417
Sit down.

690
01:28:35,250 --> 01:28:39,500
Ouassila is your mother?
Is her address on the visitors' list?

691
01:28:40,000 --> 01:28:40,958
Look.

692
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:49,042
If you want to see her alive, tell Latif
I want my friend and my stuff, okay?

693
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:50,667
- Okay?
- Agreed.

694
01:28:51,375 --> 01:28:52,375
Call.

695
01:29:02,792 --> 01:29:05,542
- Where were you?
- At the registrar's office.

696
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:07,667
Everything Ok?

697
01:29:07,667 --> 01:29:10,292
- Have you eaten?
- I have to see a guy.

698
01:29:10,333 --> 01:29:13,417
It can wait.
Come for coffee.

699
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:21,458
Help yourself.

700
01:29:29,792 --> 01:29:35,958
I want to talk to you. I've seen you in
the yard with this tall guy, the Gypsy.

701
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:39,208
What's the business?
Hash, pills?

702
01:29:40,833 --> 01:29:43,958
- Hashish.
- A lot?

703
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:49,042
- Want a part?
- No. It's your business, your business.

704
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:52,458
- How does it come in?
- The visiting rooms, the kitchens.

705
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:57,083
- So you bought off some guards.
- No. A dealer. Frozen food.

706
01:29:57,583 --> 01:30:00,708
- So that's how it works?
- For the moment, yes.

707
01:30:06,375 --> 01:30:08,417
What if you get caught?

708
01:30:12,042 --> 01:30:13,083
The hole.

709
01:30:14,083 --> 01:30:16,000
And no furloughs.

710
01:30:18,667 --> 01:30:24,875
What did I say last time? To be careful.
Not to risk your outings.

711
01:30:25,458 --> 01:30:30,375
What do you do? Fight with some guys.
Lay down your law. What's your game?

712
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:36,917
You're valuable with furloughs, Djebena.
If not, what good are you?

713
01:30:38,167 --> 01:30:39,083
Get out.

714
01:30:45,458 --> 01:30:46,500
Get out!

715
01:31:07,875 --> 01:31:09,167
Bastard!

716
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:16,583
I'll kill you..

717
01:31:27,833 --> 01:31:29,833
You don't fear me any more?

718
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:39,625
If you get around,
it's because I made you a porter.

719
01:31:40,542 --> 01:31:46,750
If you eat it's thanks to me. If you
dream, think, live.. it's thanks to me.

720
01:31:49,833 --> 01:31:52,625
You say you have no guards.
Bullshit!

721
01:31:54,000 --> 01:32:00,167
You have Luciani etched on your face!
You live for me, Djebena!

722
01:32:03,458 --> 01:32:08,458
They look at you and they see me. Who
else would they see? Can you tell me?

723
01:33:39,000 --> 01:33:40,000
Are you here?

724
01:34:29,375 --> 01:34:30,292
Come here.

725
01:34:32,417 --> 01:34:36,000
Enough already.
Come here I said.

726
01:34:36,542 --> 01:34:38,542
I have something fun
to tell you.

727
01:34:45,458 --> 01:34:47,333
You're going to Marseille.

728
01:34:49,792 --> 01:34:52,583
Your next leave will be to Marseille.

729
01:34:53,667 --> 01:34:55,917
From Brecourt to Marseille in a day?

730
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:01,292
There is a flight at 9 am
and a return flight at 3.

731
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:04,542
There you will see Brahim Lattrache.

732
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:07,875
Should I take anything?

733
01:35:10,042 --> 01:35:11,917
No. You talk and listen.

734
01:35:12,583 --> 01:35:16,000
Find out the cost of cutting
ties to the Italians.

735
01:35:19,292 --> 01:35:24,875
Tell him I'm interested in negotiating
without Jacky Marciaggi and the others.

736
01:35:27,208 --> 01:35:32,542
Sampiero will contact your friend
for payment and expenses.

737
01:35:37,250 --> 01:35:38,750
Have you ever flown?

738
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:27,500
Good morning, Truette.

739
01:36:27,542 --> 01:36:30,333
- Morning, El Djebena.
- Good morning, sir.

740
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:31,708
Open up, please.

741
01:37:02,792 --> 01:37:07,458
- Look at the time, I arrived on time!
- Careful! Don't talk to me like that.

742
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:12,417
- How should I talk? I'm at risk here.
- Okay, okay. I understand.

743
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:18,042
This car is a piece of shit!
A lure for the police.

744
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:22,500
- You're becoming an idiot.
- Enough is enough. - Why enough?

745
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,042
Who made you the boss?
If you want to split, say so.

746
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,833
Keep that for Latif's trunk.

747
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:01,958
Get Latif out of your head.

748
01:38:03,500 --> 01:38:05,958
I'll find him and I'll finish him.

749
01:38:07,292 --> 01:38:10,917
You won't finish anyone. Wake up.
Business has stopped.

750
01:38:11,125 --> 01:38:14,375
It's nothing personal.
That bastard has blocked everything.

751
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:18,500
We got back the hash,
but we can't move it.

752
01:38:20,250 --> 01:38:25,708
They even fucked us up in the city.
I swear I'll finish him off.

753
01:38:26,875 --> 01:38:27,917
Fuck them!

754
01:38:30,125 --> 01:38:31,958
You look like a lawyer.

755
01:38:40,792 --> 01:38:43,875
Boarding at 9:55,
gate 33, Terminal 2.

756
01:38:44,625 --> 01:38:45,625
Bon voyage.

757
01:39:03,125 --> 01:39:04,208
Come forward.

758
01:39:05,750 --> 01:39:06,875
Raise your arms.

759
01:40:54,542 --> 01:40:56,125
- Hands!
- Why?

760
01:40:56,375 --> 01:40:57,458
Hands!

761
01:41:48,292 --> 01:41:49,125
Move..

762
01:42:04,708 --> 01:42:06,250
Is this necessary?

763
01:42:07,667 --> 01:42:08,833
I'm not worried.

764
01:42:09,750 --> 01:42:11,000
What does Luciani want?

765
01:42:11,833 --> 01:42:14,958
He wants to know your price to quit the
deal with the Italians in the casino.

766
01:42:16,333 --> 01:42:20,333
If you agree, he'll gurantee your
position with the slot machines.

767
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:25,208
How will he guarantee our work?
With his ration card?

768
01:42:26,167 --> 01:42:27,292
No, with the Council.

769
01:42:27,333 --> 01:42:31,625
Sampiero will guarantee your place
with Marcaggi and the Corsican Council.

770
01:42:35,917 --> 01:42:40,500
- How long have you known Luciani?
- From prison.

771
01:42:42,667 --> 01:42:44,208
Have you worked for him
all this time?

772
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:49,917
How was it? Did you arrive
and begin to work?

773
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:55,583
- Does he protect you?
- No. I work. He doesn't protect me.

774
01:42:55,625 --> 01:42:58,625
- You're his Arab. He protects you.
- No. I work for them.

775
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,542
At what price?

776
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:05,792
Are you the mole?
Do you send messages?

777
01:43:06,917 --> 01:43:08,542
- Do you suck him off?
- What the hell is this?

778
01:43:12,583 --> 01:43:16,583
Why does an Arab work for the Corsicans?
Do you belly dance for them?

779
01:43:17,208 --> 01:43:22,167
Are you his girl? I had a friend there.
He never came out.

780
01:43:23,583 --> 01:43:27,167
His name was Reyeb.
Sound familiar?

781
01:43:28,792 --> 01:43:29,958
Sound familiar?

782
01:43:32,500 --> 01:43:36,542
Was it Luciani who killed him?
What do you know?

783
01:43:37,292 --> 01:43:38,708
What do you know?

784
01:43:49,583 --> 01:43:52,083
Animals coming!
Watch out!

785
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,875
There! Two more!

786
01:44:08,708 --> 01:44:09,542
Kill it!

787
01:44:25,417 --> 01:44:28,833
What are you about?
How did you know this?

788
01:44:29,333 --> 01:44:33,500
What are you? What are you?
A prophet or what?

789
01:44:37,625 --> 01:44:39,125
I killed Reyeb.

790
01:44:43,625 --> 01:44:45,917
Fuck. You've come a long way.

791
01:45:14,667 --> 01:45:17,333
- What's your name?
- Malik.
- Malik.

792
01:45:17,750 --> 01:45:23,625
- I'll wash your shirt and pants.
- The pants aren't dirty.
- You sure?

793
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:25,750
Then give me the shirt.

794
01:45:49,583 --> 01:45:55,375
Here's your shirt, son. I washed it,
but the blood stains won't come off.

795
01:46:03,875 --> 01:46:10,083
Hey, prophet! Tell me. The Muslims
want to talk about Luciani. Is that it?

796
01:46:13,250 --> 01:46:16,917
You speak with the Muslims,
the Corsicans, you come here..

797
01:46:17,917 --> 01:46:21,917
You deal with everyone. That's
not good for your balls, you know?

798
01:46:23,542 --> 01:46:24,792
Do you also talk to Lingherri?

799
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:32,583
Looks like someone is spying among the
Corsicans. Does your boss know?

800
01:46:33,417 --> 01:46:35,917
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

801
01:46:36,167 --> 01:46:40,583
- Do you know him well?
- I think so..

802
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:43,667
Well, tell this to Luciani.

803
01:46:44,250 --> 01:46:50,417
I accept his offer with one condition.
Find the spy and clean the house.

804
01:46:55,583 --> 01:46:59,583
I need a favor. I'm having
trouble with a guy in Paris.

805
01:46:59,583 --> 01:47:02,458
His name is Latif, the Egyptian.
You know him?

806
01:47:03,417 --> 01:47:04,708
What can I do for you?

807
01:47:06,208 --> 01:47:08,167
Can you tell him we know each other?

808
01:47:09,167 --> 01:47:10,458
That we work together?

809
01:47:13,500 --> 01:47:14,417
We work together..

810
01:47:15,208 --> 01:47:16,792
You think I can say that?

811
01:47:23,125 --> 01:47:25,542
Let's eat before you go.

812
01:47:27,583 --> 01:47:29,958
- Can I go to the beach?
- Whatever.

813
01:48:10,292 --> 01:48:11,333
Hurry!

814
01:48:15,917 --> 01:48:17,042
Has everything gone well?

815
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:31,417
- You'll see Latif and talk to him.
- Really? With that asshole?

816
01:48:32,917 --> 01:48:39,125
- Lattrache will talk to him.
- What does he have to do with it?

817
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:43,375
His problem is the Corsicans and ours,
Latif. We'll help each other.

818
01:48:44,875 --> 01:48:50,625
I proposed a deal. Let's be partners. We
share everything. Caches, cars, vendors.

819
01:48:51,708 --> 01:48:56,417
- We occupy the market and control it.
- Know what you're asking, brother?

820
01:48:57,583 --> 01:49:02,375
We'll settle all accounts when the time
comes. For now we leave it as it is.

821
01:49:08,333 --> 01:49:09,500
I'm sick again.

822
01:49:12,792 --> 01:49:16,833
The test results are not
good. I need more chemo.

823
01:49:22,875 --> 01:49:24,083
Will you be okay?

824
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:31,292
Take care, brother.

825
01:49:37,292 --> 01:49:40,458
You're 30 minutes late.
You know the rules.

826
01:49:40,583 --> 01:49:44,333
- All day working with car doors..
- Spread your legs.

827
01:49:45,625 --> 01:49:49,667
I'll let it go this time, but think
about your probation, moron.

828
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,000
Use your watch.

829
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:12,583
I don't care about Marcaggi's gratitude.

830
01:50:13,875 --> 01:50:18,125
What I want is for him to move
his ass and fix this.

831
01:50:19,750 --> 01:50:26,000
As we speak one of us is sleeping
with the Italians. I want to know who.

832
01:50:27,208 --> 01:50:31,250
- Does he know?
- Yes
- So?

833
01:50:31,958 --> 01:50:33,583
He's negotiating with him..

834
01:50:34,917 --> 01:50:39,583
- He thinks of himself.
- Same as Lattrache.

835
01:50:40,292 --> 01:50:43,458
- Do you know who he is?
- No.

836
01:50:46,500 --> 01:50:50,583
Wait, Cesar. Jacky wants
you out of this.

837
01:50:50,625 --> 01:50:54,083
Neither on one side nor the other.
Out!

838
01:50:56,333 --> 01:51:01,083
- He says if you need anything..
- Okay, okay. Understood.

839
01:51:07,792 --> 01:51:09,292
I have good news.

840
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:16,958
About creating a hotel company. I've
found someone. A Basque from Pamplona.

841
01:51:19,083 --> 01:51:23,292
- Why do you say "good news"?
- You asked me to look for someone.

842
01:51:23,333 --> 01:51:26,167
Wait. We are talking about
Jacky, Sardinia, casinos,

843
01:51:26,750 --> 01:51:31,125
You tell me not to interfere and
suddenly you speak of good news.

844
01:51:31,292 --> 01:51:34,125
- The ones before were not good?
- Yes.

845
01:51:34,833 --> 01:51:38,583
- Why then "good news now"?
- I didn't say "now".

846
01:51:39,167 --> 01:51:43,500
- I can tell you two good things.
- Yeah? Why did it take you so long?

847
01:51:45,625 --> 01:51:46,875
Thanks, boss.

848
01:52:03,167 --> 01:52:04,167
Pass the papers.

849
01:52:12,667 --> 01:52:16,375
- You got the results?
- Which match?

850
01:52:24,750 --> 01:52:26,167
Why do you make coffee?

851
01:52:29,000 --> 01:52:31,083
Because you're still a servant?

852
01:52:33,292 --> 01:52:37,000
You go out for me, you see Sampiero,
you see Lattrache.

853
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:42,375
You take care of my business..
The casinos, the Lingherris.

854
01:52:43,583 --> 01:52:46,458
And when I ask for coffee, you make it.

855
01:52:57,958 --> 01:53:02,042
- Don't you have anything to say?
- Which is the question?

856
01:53:02,542 --> 01:53:07,167
Why do I do it, or how I feel?
I do it because you ask me to.

857
01:53:08,167 --> 01:53:11,208
- Want to know how I feel?
- No, no. I'm not interested.

858
01:53:13,375 --> 01:53:18,500
- Do you still need me?
- It's you who needs me.

859
01:53:21,875 --> 01:53:22,833
Can I go?

860
01:53:33,375 --> 01:53:36,958
You hear me?
When will I see Latif?

861
01:53:37,917 --> 01:53:42,833
Listen. Give my whole part
to Imam Moussab. All of it.

862
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:47,958
No idea.
Try the mosque.

863
01:53:48,542 --> 01:53:51,708
I want him to know the money
is from Malik El Djebena.

864
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:54,583
He'll know how to find me.

865
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,292
Do as I say. Leave me
a message afterwards.

866
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,667
Move that ass, nigger.

867
01:54:41,333 --> 01:54:42,958
- How you doing?
- Okay.

868
01:55:38,958 --> 01:55:43,833
Is the money at the mosque yours?
Is it dirty money?

869
01:55:44,292 --> 01:55:45,917
Of course it's dirty!

870
01:55:47,292 --> 01:55:51,083
But it's better in his hands
than in mine.

871
01:55:51,500 --> 01:55:53,333
Do you think the Imam will accept it?

872
01:55:55,125 --> 01:55:56,667
It depends on you, friends.

873
01:55:59,750 --> 01:56:04,958
I understand what you do here and I
respect that, but you have no power.

874
01:56:05,458 --> 01:56:07,875
The Corsicans control the guards.

875
01:56:08,792 --> 01:56:12,625
You pray in pigsties, you sleep in
shitty places. You rise..

876
01:56:12,667 --> 01:56:17,208
and they crush you again. Perhaps the
Imam knows how to use that money.

877
01:56:19,042 --> 01:56:20,125
What do you want?

878
01:56:21,417 --> 01:56:24,583
Just like you, Hassan.
A better life for me and my brothers.

879
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:29,417
You think I'm stupid or what?
You just want to use us. That's all.

880
01:56:29,458 --> 01:56:33,417
So? As long as it's good for everyone.

881
01:56:37,792 --> 01:56:42,083
Listen. If you ever talk to
the Imam again, you're dead.

882
01:56:42,542 --> 01:56:46,083
You talk money to me.
It's between us, okay?

883
01:56:50,958 --> 01:56:54,583
Is that why you gave him the money?
To talk to me?

884
01:56:57,583 --> 01:57:00,000
- From a killer to a killer?
- Leave that shit.

885
01:57:00,042 --> 01:57:01,458
Just kidding.

886
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:40,750
Christmas

887
01:57:57,500 --> 01:58:00,708
Handmade. No gifts, no Christmas.

888
01:58:04,958 --> 01:58:09,625
- I am the gift. 100% handmade.
- What a gift!

889
01:58:10,750 --> 01:58:13,708
Want some?
Help yourself.

890
01:58:18,625 --> 01:58:20,208
Is it made from wild boar?

891
01:58:21,958 --> 01:58:23,042
Are you kidding?

892
01:58:24,750 --> 01:58:27,250
Shall we stop?
Can we talk honestly?

893
01:58:30,958 --> 01:58:32,000
Why?

894
01:58:34,333 --> 01:58:38,917
I have to ask you a favor,
but not because you work for me,

895
01:58:40,125 --> 01:58:43,833
but because I trust you.
Do you see the difference?

896
01:58:46,250 --> 01:58:47,708
I'm not sure.

897
01:58:55,167 --> 01:58:57,750
I saw Vettori. He has some information.

898
01:58:58,333 --> 01:59:01,000
He knows that I'm dealing
with the Lingherris.

899
01:59:01,792 --> 01:59:05,417
Form a team.
How are your guys?

900
01:59:06,208 --> 01:59:08,542
- A team for what?
- To eliminate them.

901
01:59:08,750 --> 01:59:12,333
- Eliminate the Lingherris?
- The Lingherris & Jacky Marcaggi.

902
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:16,375
Kill Marcaggi? Is that it?
Kill your boss?

903
01:59:16,750 --> 01:59:22,167
Nobody must know. You, me,
Vettori and nobody else.

904
01:59:22,875 --> 01:59:24,375
It will be in Paris.

905
01:59:24,792 --> 01:59:29,708
Vettori will provide the stuff. He'll
help, but we must remain invisible.

906
01:59:30,375 --> 01:59:31,792
Can you do that for me?

907
01:59:52,167 --> 01:59:54,167
Any plans for when you get out?

908
01:59:58,292 --> 02:00:02,083
When we have the casinos, we'll
need someone to manage them.

909
02:00:03,917 --> 02:00:05,167
With Lattrache.

910
02:00:24,667 --> 02:00:28,042
We'll do it. We'll do it.
I only have six months.

911
02:00:28,083 --> 02:00:31,833
- Six more months and that's it.
- Maybe they're wrong.

912
02:00:32,167 --> 02:00:34,833
Give me time.
What's the problem?

913
02:00:35,333 --> 02:00:37,958
- Kill those guys?
- Speak softly.

914
02:00:38,333 --> 02:00:40,750
We don't know them.
What do we care?

915
02:00:41,208 --> 02:00:43,167
Think about when you get out.

916
02:00:44,917 --> 02:00:46,000
I won't be here.

917
02:00:46,458 --> 02:00:49,208
You can think of your future, I can't.

918
02:00:49,625 --> 02:00:53,250
Malik.. there's Djamila.
There's my son.

919
02:00:53,292 --> 02:00:58,083
- What'll I leave them? A fridge? A TV?
- What are you saying?

920
02:00:59,000 --> 02:01:00,833
You'll take care of them.

921
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,958
That's what I ask you, brother.

922
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:10,292
You'll say we agree.
And we'll do it.

923
02:01:33,958 --> 02:01:37,667
I talked to my outside friend.
We'll do it.

924
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:40,083
He's put together a first class team.

925
02:01:41,208 --> 02:01:46,667
I'll talk to my people. Give me the
number. Vettori will call your friend.

926
02:02:50,792 --> 02:02:52,333
Have you tried this?

927
02:02:54,125 --> 02:02:55,583
I'll give you some.

928
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:44,667
Are you listening? It's bad.

929
02:04:44,750 --> 02:04:48,042
Our guys are good for drugs.
Not for other stuff.

930
02:04:48,500 --> 02:04:52,542
- You were the one who wanted
to do it.What now?
- I can't force them.

931
02:04:53,083 --> 02:04:57,917
When the Corsicans took out the
guns they ran away. Like devils.

932
02:04:57,958 --> 02:05:01,417
That bastard Vettori
treats us like shit.

933
02:05:01,542 --> 02:05:05,083
There was a fight on the way.
Now Khalid wants to kill him.

934
02:05:07,333 --> 02:05:09,667
- Find some other guys.
- Now?

935
02:05:09,708 --> 02:05:11,292
- For a contract?
- Who cares?

936
02:05:14,167 --> 02:05:15,250
You got a minute.

937
02:05:22,542 --> 02:05:24,750
I lost my time and money
with this group of idiots and..

938
02:05:26,292 --> 02:05:27,750
just look at him!

939
02:05:28,167 --> 02:05:30,958
- Be careful what you say.
- I will deliver you from your misery!

940
02:05:31,375 --> 02:05:32,792
- Hands off!
- Calm down!

941
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:37,708
Hush! We will do it our way.

942
02:05:37,750 --> 02:05:40,750
- What?
- I'll try to explain. May I?

943
02:05:43,333 --> 02:05:46,875
- Listen. We'll kill them.
- Promise.

944
02:05:46,917 --> 02:05:50,458
We'll kill them,
but they can't know how.

945
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:54,375
- I'm going to hit you. Lower you head.
- What?

946
02:05:54,417 --> 02:05:56,292
I'll hit you and you lower your head.

947
02:06:00,792 --> 02:06:04,167
I get it. Can I go on?

948
02:06:18,625 --> 02:06:22,917
Pick me up without the others.
You and I will deal with this.

949
02:06:24,250 --> 02:06:25,333
Will you be able to do it?

950
02:06:32,708 --> 02:06:33,667
Guard!

951
02:06:34,708 --> 02:06:38,042
Are you ready to complete your
insertion and rehabilitation project?

952
02:06:38,667 --> 02:06:44,375
- It's a support center for detainees.
- I know Imam Moussab's Center.

953
02:06:45,500 --> 02:06:49,917
You requested two days.
It seems excessive.

954
02:06:50,250 --> 02:06:52,875
I propose a practice module of one day.
From 7am to 7 pm.

955
02:06:54,625 --> 02:06:56,583
- Is that all right?
- Yes, very good.

956
02:07:11,500 --> 02:07:16,708
Muhammed, peace be upon him, reached
the top of the mountain and fell asleep.

957
02:07:17,167 --> 02:07:23,125
The angel Gabriel appeared.
Do you know what he said?

958
02:07:23,500 --> 02:07:28,167
He said, "Pray, pray, Muhammed.
Pray to God because He created you. "

959
02:07:28,208 --> 02:07:33,500
"He created mankind from scratch.
Pray what He taught in his writings. "

960
02:07:36,208 --> 02:07:37,250
Wonderful!

961
02:07:38,375 --> 02:07:40,417
Wonderful, brother!

962
02:07:43,750 --> 02:07:45,917
Prayer.

963
02:08:03,000 --> 02:08:03,958
The door.

964
02:08:12,208 --> 02:08:13,042
Have a good day, Djebena.

965
02:08:28,333 --> 02:08:29,958
- What about the others?
- In the back.

966
02:08:59,625 --> 02:09:01,125
The car comes out here.

967
02:09:03,542 --> 02:09:07,875
A bodyguard and a driver. The guard
gets out first to open the door.

968
02:09:12,000 --> 02:09:15,667
He wears a bulletproof vest.
We let them get out.

969
02:09:17,917 --> 02:09:19,458
We hit the bodyguard first,
then the others.

970
02:09:22,792 --> 02:09:23,625
Come on.

971
02:10:18,333 --> 02:10:19,375
They're coming out.

972
02:10:19,583 --> 02:10:20,708
Coming.

973
02:10:20,875 --> 02:10:22,000
Black car.

974
02:10:22,708 --> 02:10:23,792
Wait for them to come out.

975
02:10:25,208 --> 02:10:26,208
I'll go for the bodyguard.

976
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:53,333
What's going on?

977
02:11:40,667 --> 02:11:42,667
Come on, come on!

978
02:11:46,083 --> 02:11:47,083
See them?

979
02:11:49,750 --> 02:11:51,250
Yes, now I see them.

980
02:11:52,375 --> 02:11:54,167
- Three cars in front.
- Follow them!

981
02:12:01,625 --> 02:12:05,000
It's turning. What do we do?
They stopped!

982
02:12:05,125 --> 02:12:09,208
- Go on. I'll kill them.
- How? It's an armored car.

983
02:12:10,083 --> 02:12:14,667
I tell you it's armored. If they don't
come out, there's nothing we can do.

984
02:12:22,667 --> 02:12:23,583
What's he doing?

985
02:12:24,458 --> 02:12:25,458
Buying tobacco.

986
02:12:40,917 --> 02:12:44,000
- I'll go.
- It won't work.

987
02:13:34,833 --> 02:13:36,042
Macarggi here!

988
02:13:37,917 --> 02:13:39,000
Down!

989
02:14:11,250 --> 02:14:15,417
I can't hear!
I hear nothing!

990
02:14:42,917 --> 02:14:45,792
This blood is not mine.
It's theirs.

991
02:15:04,042 --> 02:15:06,083
We've fucked you up, pigs!

992
02:15:16,208 --> 02:15:17,458
Are you Jacky Marcaggi?

993
02:15:19,292 --> 02:15:23,500
Don't talk. I can't hear. Just signs.
Do you know this guy?

994
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,542
Your friend Luciani sent us to kill you.

995
02:15:29,583 --> 02:15:31,583
I won't do it. He's all yours.

996
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:34,583
- Get revenge!
- I'll take care of him.

997
02:16:10,375 --> 02:16:13,792
- Are you sleeping?
- No, no. I'm exhausted.

998
02:16:15,750 --> 02:16:19,292
- Have you talked to Djamila?
- I'll sleep in the kids' room.

999
02:16:21,042 --> 02:16:24,708
- You won't go back tonight?
- No, I'll go back tomorrow.

1000
02:16:27,083 --> 02:16:31,833
- They'll put you in a punishment cell.
- As the Corsicans kill each other.

1001
02:16:34,375 --> 02:16:35,625
Need anything?

1002
02:16:40,667 --> 02:16:42,417
I'm not doing chemo.

1003
02:16:44,042 --> 02:16:45,375
You're screwed.

1004
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:02,125
Watch your sleeve.
You're rubbing it on the plate.

1005
02:17:07,250 --> 02:17:10,042
- Eat a little, Riyad.
- I'm eating.

1006
02:17:10,083 --> 02:17:12,833
- Want some more?
- No thanks.

1007
02:17:13,375 --> 02:17:15,875
- Any good?
- Yes, delicious.

1008
02:18:34,792 --> 02:18:37,417
El Djebena, Malik.
35114T.

1009
02:19:51,725 --> 02:19:56,559
40 days, 40 nights

1010
02:21:35,042 --> 02:21:36,292
Are you there?

1011
02:22:26,042 --> 02:22:27,375
Are you there?

1012
02:26:03,500 --> 02:26:05,958
Make sure you have everything
and sign here.

1013
02:26:32,958 --> 02:26:34,125
Garbage.

1014
02:26:52,375 --> 02:26:56,375
Your exit papers.
The door.

1015
02:26:58,083 --> 02:27:02,292
- Good luck, Djebena.
- Good day, sir.

1016
02:27:29,875 --> 02:27:30,792
How are you?

1017
02:27:36,708 --> 02:27:37,542
- It's cold.
- Very.

1018
02:27:40,333 --> 02:27:41,917
It's not a good time to come out.

1019
02:27:48,417 --> 02:27:50,208
- Have you come by bus?
- Yes

1020
02:27:52,583 --> 02:27:55,292
- When's the next one?
- Half an hour.

1021
02:27:58,250 --> 02:28:00,667
- Want to walk a little?
- If you like.

1022
02:28:02,292 --> 02:28:04,042
Do you know where you're going to live?

1023
02:28:05,917 --> 02:28:09,333
Come home. I'll sleep with the
child and you use his room.

1024
02:28:10,583 --> 02:28:12,833
- I don't want to disturb.
- You won't.

1025
02:28:14,125 --> 02:28:17,250
Okay.

1026
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:50,000
