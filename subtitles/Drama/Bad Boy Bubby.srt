00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,600
Be still!

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,800
Princess Pink.

7
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,300
Princess Pink.

8
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,000
Such a good little boy...

00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,500
That's right...

10
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
That's a good boy, Bubby...

11
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Good boy...

12
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,500
Good little boy...

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,500
Toilet...?

14
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,100
Don't move!

15
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,400
Jesus can see everything.

16
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,700
He tells me you moved,
by Christ, I'll beat you brainless!

17
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Be still!

18
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Bubby naughty...

19
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, Christ!

20
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,000
What you done?!

21
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,100
You... filthy little cunt!

22
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,400
You dirty little shit!

23
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,700
I'll send you to hell,
just you see,

24
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,700
you'll go to hell,
and your eyes will fall out,

25
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,100
and your prick will fall off,
you dirty little SLIME!

26
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,400
You're such a good little boy...

27
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
Mummy does love
her little Bubby...

00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
You like'em, don't you, Bub...

29
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Beautiful, ain't they?

By Christ, I'll beat you brainless!

35
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,600
Can't come outside,

36
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,900
'cause no gas-mask!

37
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,600

Now be still!

39
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,100
Poison!

40
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Poison!

41
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,600
If the poison don't get you?

42
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,500
Then God will.

43
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,200
Don't you bloody forget it.

44
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,800
Don't you bloody forget it!

45
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,000
Where Kat from?

46
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,200
Outside.

47
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,400
How come he ain't...

48
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,100
...no gas-mask?

49
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,100
Don't need it.

50
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,600
Don't breathe.

51
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,600
How don't breathe?

52
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,400
That... ain't breathin'.

53
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,100
Eat!

54
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,600
I know you're in there, Florence!

55
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,900
I'll be back!

56
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,300
What?

57
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,900
Want to go out, do you?

58
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
Want to go out to see
what it's like, do you?!

59
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,200
Want to go outside?!

60
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,000
Cough, choke?!

61
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,200
DIE?!

62
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
I know, you're in there, Florence!

63
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,300
I'll be back!

64
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,500
Bubby a good little boy.

65
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,900
Mummy's little boy.

66
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,500
Shut up!

67
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
Don't be disgusting!

68
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,400
Anybody there?

69
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,100
Come on!

70
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,700
I know you're in there!

71
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,200
Go away!

72
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:43,100
Florence? Open up or
I'll bust the door down!

73
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,700
I know it's you!

74
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,000
I've seen you come and go!

75
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,100
That's funny... That's funny...!

76
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,700
All these years and
I didn't know I had a son!

77
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,100
Not so funny.

78
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,800
Christ, Florence! You've got
to see the funny side of things!

79
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,200
I've been waiting for you
35 years here to come back.

80
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,900
Yes... well...

81
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,600
I meant to come back
sooner, didn't I?

82
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,700
Just...

83
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Well, just I didn't get
round to it before.

84
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,900
I'm here now, ain't I?

85
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Yes...

86
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,200
Yes, you are...

87
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,400
You're here now.

88
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:10,500
God...

89
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,200
Thirty-five years...
Gone quick!

90
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,300
You still look good, Flo.

91
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:19,300
You always were
a good-looking broad!

92
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,700
You always were the charmer...

93
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,200
Yep.

94
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Charmed a few girls in my time.

95
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:30,800
And yet I never knowed I had a son!

96
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,900
Good, healthy-looking specimen, too.

97
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,300
You done well, Flo.

98
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,800
Hey, son!

99
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,500
You can call me Pop!

100
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm your Pop!

101
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,500
Pop.

102
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,800
Pop.

103
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,800
He's gettin' the idea.

104
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,500
Pop.

105
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,200
Pop-pop-pop...

106
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,100
Pop.

107
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
- Pop-pop-pop-pop...
- Yeah, yeah...

108
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,400
Alright, don't go making
a big thing of it.

109
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,600
Listen, Flo.

110
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
I know I should have been back
sooner and I'm sorry and all that.

111
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,400
But do you reckon, you know...

112
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,500
You and me...

113
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
You know...

114
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,600
Will you still have me, Flo?

115
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,900
I don't know.

116
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,900
You bein' a man of God now...

117
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,100
Oh, that...

118
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Did a bit of preaching
part-time, nothing in it.

119
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,300
How about it, then?

120
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,400
Make an honest women of you!

121
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,100
Don't know if I can
trust you, Harold.

122
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,300
Hey, what's up, son? You got
a mental condition or something?

123
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
If you and me are gonna learn
to live together...

124
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,800
...we gotta have some respect!

125
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,500
Comprendez?

126
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
I think he comprends.

127
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,400
How about some refreshment, love?

128
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,700
Sorry, Harold.

129
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,400
Hey, son!

130
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:35,700
Me and your mother
would like to have a bit of a talk.

131
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,300
How about going outside?

132
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Bubby ain't used to going outside.

133
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,900
By himself...

134
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,600
Son, you ain't a poofter, are you?

135
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:49,900
I don't want any son of mine
growing up to be a... homosexual.

136
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,100
I'd disown him first.

137
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,400
You got to try to understand...

138
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Me and Bubby...

139
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,500
We been here... hm...
by ourselves a long time.

140
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,200
But he ain't like other kids.

141
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,200
He was such a difficult birth.

142
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,400
All alone in here,
no one to help you...

143
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,700
I didn't think
I'd pull through.

144
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,500
So you gotta try to understand.

145
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,600
As long as he ain't a poofter.

146
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,200
Oh, no. No, he ain't.

147
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
Dry old conversation, Flo!

148
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,900
Pardon?

149
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,200
Dry old conversation!

150
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,300
Oh, sorry!

151
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,100
We don't get very many visitors!

152
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,100
Hm, would a sherry do?

153
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,600
Any port in the storm...!

154
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,900
Any port in the storm...

155
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,500
I can see right down
your dress, Flo.

156
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,700
God, you've got great tits!

157
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
They were big before,

158
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,600
but now they're great
big whoppers of things!

159
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,600
You're just being nice!

160
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,100
No, seriously, Flo.

161
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,200
They're the sort of tits
a man can really lose himself in.

162
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,100
Bury his face and forget
about the troubles of-

163
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,300
What troubles, Harold?

164
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,300
What troubles can a man forget?

165
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,400
Let go, Bubby, let go!

166
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,600
Jesus...! He's mad!

167
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
The fucking bastard!

168
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,100
Harold! Harold, it's...

169
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,200
- He was trying to kill me! - He was not!
- You mad, you bastard!

170
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,600
He didn't mean you any harm,

171
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,200
he was just trying to see
whether you breathed or not.

172
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:45,300
What?!

173
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,500
It's not his fault, he's got
some strange ideas.

174
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,500
You can't blame the kid.

175
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,600
He can't help it.
He never had a father.

176
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,400
Nearly killed the
only one he's got.

177
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,300
Christ, kid! You're a weirdo!

178
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
Weirdo.

179
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,000
Christ, kid. You're a weirdo.

180
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,800
Christ, kid.

181
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,200
You're a weirdo!

182
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You've got lovely skin, Flo.

183
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,800
Soft, and sexy.

184
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,500
You're a sexy woman.

185
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
You make it hard

186
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:24,100
for a red-blooded man
to keep his hands off you.

187
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,100
You have lovely hands, Harold.

188
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,000
Be a pity not to
be using them.

189
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,700
What's that you've found, then?

190
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,000
Don't know.

191
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,100
Don't know what this could be.

192
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,200
It's me dress that's
what you've found.

193
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
Yeah...

194
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,000
But what's this,
under the dress?

195
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,000
You have already
had your look at it.

196
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,500
Is it...?

197
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,100
Is it?

198
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
You'll have to wait and see!

199
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,800
Gates of Paradise...

200
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,800
One of the seven
wonders of the world!

201
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,700
Do you really think so?

202
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:06,900
Yes.

203
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,200
It's not too big?

204
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,500
It's perfection, Flo.

205
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,700
Oh, that's lovely...

206
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,000
Hey, you see...?

207
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,500
Oh yeah, do that again...

208
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,400
Oh, that's nice...

209
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,500
HEY! Get the fuck out of here!

210
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,500
You pervert!

211
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,700
Give your mother some privacy!

212
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,900
Go back to bed, Bubby!

213
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,200
Why the hell you call him Bubby?

214
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,100
Bubby's a stupid name!

215
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,100
I was waiting for
you to get back.

216
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,900
But it suits him.

217
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,700
Yeah, a stupid name
for a stupid kid!

218
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,200
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

219
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,500
What the fuck...?

220
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,300
The kid's completely crackers!

221
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,500
You're a weirdo!

222
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,200
Oh, Jesus Christ...

223
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,600
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

224
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:56,900
Am I?

225
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
Thank you.

226
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,900
God, you've got great tits!

227
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,700
Great, big whoppers of things!

228
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:12,200
One of the seven wonders
of the world, Flo!

229
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,600
It's perfection.

230
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,800
Oh, Bubby...

231
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,900
My little boy.

232
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,800
Gates of Paradise...

233
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,700
He's attacking me, Harold!

234
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,800
Jesus Christ!

235
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Fuck me!

236
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,700
Get the fuck out of here!

237
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:29,200
YOU MAD BASTARD!

238
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,700
You mad bastard!

239
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,500
You fucking cunt! You get
the bastard out of here!

240
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,900
- You got lovely skin, Flo.
- YOU SEXUAL PERVERT!

241
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,200
- You're a weirdo!
- GET THAT CUNT OUT OF HERE!

242
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
GET OUT...!

243
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,700
Leave Bubby alone!

244
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,800
YOU DIRTY FUCKING SHIT!

245
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,300
GET OUT!

246
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,200
Get the fuck out of here!

247
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
Oh, doormat. Excuse me.

248
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,400
The fucking kid's
trying to be me again!

249
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,800
SHUT THE FUCK UP, KID!

250
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,700
You useless shit,
you perverted bastard...!

251
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,500
You're good for nothing!

252
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,100
Nothing... except messing
things up... isn't he, Flo?!

253
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,900
Messed the place up good and
proper, didn't you, you little cunt!

254
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,700
You useless cunt!

255
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
- Why don't you piss off?!
- Leave Bubby alone!

256
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Leave Bubby alone!

257
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,400
Leave Bubby alone!

258
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,500
You stupid useless kid,

259
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,700
you should've been left to die!

260
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,500
What did you say?!

261
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,000
He should've been, the kid
should've been left to die!

262
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:28,600
Oh, you bastard,
I kept him alive for you!

263
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,000
Wasn't worth the
trouble you fat cow!

264
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,500
You be still...

265
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,700
You be still...

266
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,500
YOU BE STILL!

267
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
You be still...

268
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,400
Now... you be still, Pop.

269
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,100
Mum...

270
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,000
You be still, too.

271
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,200
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

272
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,300
Get off the road,
you fucking greenie bastard!

273
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:52,100
Get a look at the
bastard, will you!

274
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,400
You fucking poofter bastard!

275
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,800
Nooo...!

276
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,100
No...!

277
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,300
Put money in it, bastard!

278
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,900
He snatched my bloody handbag!

279
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,400
Bloody bastard!

280
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,100
Bloody bastard!

281
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,000
Yeah...

282
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,400
Yeah...

283
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
See you.

284
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,900
See you.

285
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,700
Bloody bastard...

286
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,200
Bloody bastard...

287
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,100
We'll sit in the back!

288
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,300
We sit in the back!

289
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Is it the usual?

290
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,100
- Shall we have the usual?
- Yeah.

291
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,800
Okay, hm, two specials, no pineapple!

292
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,300
Alright, beautiful, thanks
very much. Alright.

293
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,400
Lick! Your tongue!

294
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,500
Yeah! Now lick me here!

295
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Here, dummy!

296
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,500
Oh, Christ, that prickles!

297
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,600
Do you like singing?

298
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,400
Do you like that?

299
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,600
When I want to feel close
to my special friend, Jesus...

300
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,700
I sing him a very special song...

301
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,200
Do you want to hear it?

302
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,200
It's my good friend
Jesus's favourite song.

303
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,100
Did you like it?

304
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,900
You're a dag!

305
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,900
Christ, kid! You're a weirdo!

306
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,700
Yeah, that's what you are!

307
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,700
A weird kid!

308
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,900
Nothing but a big...
weird... kid...

309
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,000
Hey! Piss off out the way,
mate, I gotta cut this tree down!

310
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,400
Hey!

311
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,700
You fucking deaf?

312
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,600
You're a queer looking
rooster, aren't you?

313
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,800
What're you, fucking
one of them greenies?

314
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:30,500
Hey! Come on, fuck off,
or I'll cut your prick off!

315
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,500
You fucking idiot!
Go on, get out of it...

316
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,600
Come on!

317
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,300
Little...!

318
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,100
Come on, let's just get out of here.

319
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,900
You'll just come with me, sir!

320
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,300
You don't want any
trouble now, do you?

321
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,300
Come on! This way!

322
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,300
Yes, mate! Can I help you?

323
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,100
Err, printshop...

324
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,400
Get, get, get...!!

325
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,800
You try that again, mate,
and I'll call the cops!

326
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,900
Two of those wonderfully fattening
chocolate eclairs, please, Sam!

327
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,100
Here we are! Thanks.

328
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,200
Thank you, sweetie!

329
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:29,200
Yes!

330
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,500
Two of those wonderfully fattening
chocolate eclairs, please, Sam!

331
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,500
Two dollars! Thanks!

332
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,700
Thank you, sweetie!

333
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,700
Er, no, that'll be two
dollars, thanks, buddy!

334
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,000
Two of those wonderfully fattening
chocolate eclairs, please, Sam!

335
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:49,300
Thank you, sweetie!

336
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,700
I think we'd better find
out where you belong.

337
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:00,800
To take you back there.

338
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:02,100
Come on!

339
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,100
Yes.

340
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:15,700
I still look alright, don't I?

341
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,900
Get off the fucking road,
you fucking greenie bastard!

342
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:37,000
Get off the fucking road,
you fucking greenie bastard!

343
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,200
I don't like fucking smart cunts!

344
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,400
I saw what that
fucking pig did to you...

345
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,100
Beer?

346
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:16,500
There's some down here.

347
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:19,100
I've gotta stop drinking.
I've gotta get my life in order.

348
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Who wants it?

349
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:22,900
Bubby wants it!

350
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,300
Bubby!

351
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:27,600
Rip the scab off that one, mate!

352
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,200
We need more beer!

353
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,300
We need more beer!

354
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,800
Let's give him a taste
of what's to come!

355
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,300
Sure, a bit of rock'n'roll!

356
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,600
One! Two!
One-two-three!

357
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:41,700
#If you see Kay!

358
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,700
#Can you tell her I'm leaving?
#Can you tell her I'm losing my mind?

359
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,600
#If you see Kay!

360
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:52,300
#Can you tell her I'm leaving
#If you'd say until she says okay

361
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,400
#I've got to hear you say okay

362
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,400
#I've got to make her take away

363
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:03,300
#I can't figure it out any other way!

364
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,600
#F. U. C. K!

365
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:08,300
#Can you tell her I'll leave her?
#Can you tell her I'm losing my mind?

366
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:13,900
How's it, roadie?

367
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:18,800
I would never drive, mate!

368
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:22,100
Hey, Bubby!

369
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,400
Can you give us a hand, mate?

370
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,200
Bubby is the apprentice roadie.

371
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,800
That's good, Bubby.

372
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,400
Bubby is the apprentice roadie.

373
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,800
Yeah, just don't drop
the fucking speaker, okay?

374
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:41,100
Just don't drop the
fucking speaker, okay?

375
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:46,600
Oh, fuck!

376
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,500
Jesus!

377
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Alright?

378
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Is this where the band
supposed to be?

379
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,400
Yeah.

380
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
Alright... Hm... What
time are you starting?

381
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,100
About an hour and half ago,
but nobody's turned up yet.

382
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,100
Want to come in?
We'll play!

383
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,100
I... don't think so.

384
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,200
I was hoping there'd be some girls.

385
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,100
No girls, mate, only music.

386
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,200
Thanks anyway!

387
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:13,200
Who was that?

388
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:16,000
I don't know. A neighbour complaining
about all the racket we were making.

389
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:17,800
Ah, very fucking funny, mate.

390
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:18,900
He was a customer.

391
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:19,900
Where did he go?

392
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,000
How the fuck would I know?
Down the road to see another band!

393
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:23,500
And you just let him walk out!

394
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:25,400
What the fuck was I
supposed to do? Force him?

395
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,800
How the fuck we're
going to pay for the hall,

396
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,900
if you let all the people
walk out without paying!

397
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:30,100
Jesus fucking Christ!

398
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,200
Is that the lot?

399
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:49,300
- I've nothing.
- I've nothing.

400
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:53,500
What about you, hold-out?
Is that it?

401
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:57,100
Try the other pocket, mate,
we saw you tried that one before.

402
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,500
Nothing!

403
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,500
Never anything.

404
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,000
How about you?

405
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:11,200
Got any money?

406
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,300
Sure...

407
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,300
Search him.

408
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,400
Money! Do you have any money?

409
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,200
You greedy little cunt!

410
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,100
I ain't got enough money
to keep buying you milk!

411
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,200
So take that, mate!

412
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,000
Shut up!

413
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,400
Well, if that's all there is...

414
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,400
...we're stuffed.

415
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,400
Yeah! We're stuffed.

416
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,100
- Christ!
- Hilarious...

417
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:37,900
No money, no girls...
It's enough to make you puke!

418
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,800
And where's that fucking
smell coming from?!

419
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,900
Your fucking feet!

420
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,500
Fuck that fucking smell!
What about the fucking money?

421
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,500
Hurry up, Bubby! We're
in the middle of a crisis!

422
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,100
- Settle!
- It's okay, mate.

423
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,400
CLINGWRAP KILLER

424
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,400
- That be Mum!
- What?

425
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,100
That be Pop!

426
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:11,900
Them be Mum and Pop!

427
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,000
What?

428
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,400
Is that your mother?

429
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,800
Bubby Mum!

430
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,600
And your father?

431
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,100
- What do you reckon...
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

432
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,500
Ah, wouldn't be him!

433
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:27,500
Big shit!

434
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:28,700
It wouldn't!

435
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,500
- I don't know...
- It says there's a reward!

436
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,600
Fifty thousand bucks!

437
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,300
Take a look at this!

438
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:41,300
- What is this...
- Aah, shit!

439
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,400
- Christ!
- Fuck!

440
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,000
That be Kat!

441
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,800
No, it was a cat.

442
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,700
Jesus...

443
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,500
- Eer...
- It is him!

444
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,600
- It has to be!
- Fifty grand!

445
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,900
Oh, fuck...

446
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,300
Alright, he's harmless!

447
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:02,800
- Tell that to the cat.
- He can stay in your bed tonight.

448
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,600
Jesus, Bubby, take
that cat outside, will you?

449
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,000
Just take it
outside for a while.

450
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Don't go too far, okay?

451
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:21,800
Okay.

452
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,000
Bring us back some
money or something!

453
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:30,700
Okay!

454
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,100
Five, six, seven, eight, nine...

455
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,400
Jesus fucking Christ!

456
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,800
Get that fucking thing out of
here, you mad bastard! What...?

457
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:53,600
I don't like fucking smart cunts!

458
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,200
Well...

459
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,300
If that's all there is...

460
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:32,300
...we're stuffed.

461
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,400
Ah, fucking racket!

462
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,200
Yeah, they're probably after him.

463
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,400
Oh, shit.

464
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,400
- What're we gonna do now?
- We're gonna go to jail!

465
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,500
I can feel it!
We're going to go to jail!

466
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,500
- Bullshit!
- Shut up!

467
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,600
Look! Look...!

468
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,900
Let's just put these on.

469
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,500
More trouble
that he's worth.

470
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:36,400
You just take care
of that money.

471
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,300
It's alright, Bubby.

472
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:58,600
#Tell you a story
#that's sad but true

473
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:03,300
#Tell you a story
#about you know who

474
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,000
#A boy called Bubby

475
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:08,800
#sitting right over there

476
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,000
#Bad Boy Bubby
#with the wild, crazy hair...

477
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,200
Bad Boy Bubby...

478
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,300
#Oh, yeah!

479
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:20,300
Bad boy...

480
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:25,000
#Bad Boy Bubby
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues

481
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:33,000
#Got them? Bad Boy Bubby
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues...

482
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:41,600
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues
#from my head right to my shoes...

483
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,100
#Well, we met him
#when we were touring in '53

484
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,600
#Well, that's not true
#but it rhymes with Bubby

485
00:57:51,700 --> 00:57:53,400
#Bad Boy Bubby

486
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,400
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues...

487
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:06,300
He's a classic, isn't he?

488
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,400
You don't own
a cat, do you, Dan?

489
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,100
We're going to leave
you with Dan, Bubby. Okay?

490
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,100
See you, Bubby!

491
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,400
And don't be a bad boy!

492
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:20,300
#Bad Boy Bubby...
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues...

493
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,200
Hey! Hey!

494
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,300
Why don't you go and talk
to her, if she's so interesting?

495
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:40,300
You're a sexy woman, Flo.

496
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:44,300
God, you've got great tits.

497
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:48,500
Great, big whoppers of things.

498
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,500
You're a very cruel person,
do you know that?

499
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:55,600
Just because you're rich,
and you're handsome, you...

500
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:58,600
...you think it's okay
to make fun of people like me?

501
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,200
Well, it's not funny!

502
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:01,800
It's just hurtful!

503
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:09,900
Bubby naughty bad boy,

504
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:10,900
dirty little cunt!

505
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:11,900
Oh, leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

506
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:13,900
Just please, leave me...
Go away from me!

507
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:15,600
SOMEONE HELP ME!

508
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,600
Why don't you
bastards do something!

509
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:20,300
Watch the language, lady, or I
cool you off for a couple of days!

510
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,200
Hey, we're not the
bloody criminals!

511
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,400
Those arseholes
stole our purses!

512
01:00:24,500 --> 01:00:27,100
We can't help if you go
walk about at night by yourselves!

513
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,000
Who'd want to steal from a boong?

514
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,600
Oh, for Christ's sake!

515
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:32,500
We were on our way home from work!

516
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:35,800
Work?! Huh! That'd be the day!
Something illegal, no doubt!

517
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:37,100
Youse are really fucked!

518
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:38,500
Now, I warned you
about the language!

519
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:39,600
Now you can piss off out of here!

520
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,000
And consider yourselves lucky
I didn't lock up the pair of you!

521
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:43,700
Fuck, let's go!

522
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:45,700
I'd have that head wound seen to!

523
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:46,900
Get fucked!

524
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:36,300
Psst!

525
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:40,700
Whatcha doin'?

526
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,500
What ya doin'?

527
01:01:58,300 --> 01:01:59,400
What're you doin'?

528
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,200
Why don't you talk to me more?

529
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,100
What, cat got your tongue?

530
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:20,900
I got feelings too, you know.

531
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,100
But...

532
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:27,400
Not fun being on
night shift, is it?

533
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,200
Get lonely, you know.

534
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:42,600
Why don't you talk to me?

535
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:44,400
Get fucked!

536
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:19,000
Leave me alone!
Please leave me alone!

537
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,200
Someone help me!

538
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:24,000
You want out?!

539
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:29,500
It's the Animal for you,
you fucking nutter!

540
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:06,900
Me be Bubby.

541
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,600
The Clingwrap Killer.

542
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:20,200
You have been rehabilitated.

543
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:25,500
Here's ten dollars to
see you on your way.

544
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:26,700
You can go.

545
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,700
Don't let me see
you back here.

546
01:06:34,900 --> 01:06:36,000
Well...

547
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:38,500
If that's all there is...

548
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,300
...we're stuffed!

549
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,200
Jesus can see everything I do...

550
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:08,300
...and he's going to beat me brainless!

551
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:19,500
Come!

552
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,200
You see...

553
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:49,400
No one's going to help you, Bubby.

554
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,700
Because there isn't
anybody out there to do it.

555
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,100
No one.

556
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,400
We're all just complicated arrangements

557
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,000
of atoms and subatomic particles,

558
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:05,100
we don't live.

559
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:09,300
But our atoms do move
about in such a way

560
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,800
as to give us identity
and consciousness.

561
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:15,000
We don't die;

562
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,400
our atoms just rearrange
themselves.

563
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,900
There is no God.

564
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:25,100
There can be no God,

565
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:28,700
it's ridiculous to think in
terms of a superior being.

566
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:33,000
An inferior being,
maybe, because we,

567
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:35,000
we who don't even exist,

568
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:38,300
we arrange our lives with more order

569
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,300
and harmony than God ever
arranged the earth.

570
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:44,100
We measure...

571
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,700
Plot...

572
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,100
We create wonderful music.

573
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,100
We are the architects
of our own existence.

574
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:59,900
What a lunatic concept
to bow down before a God

575
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,500
who slaughters millions
of innocent children...

576
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,500
Who slowly and agonisingly
starves them to death...

577
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,900
beats them,

578
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:11,400
tortures them...

579
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:13,600
Rejects them.

580
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:19,500
What folly to even think that
we should not insult such a God...

581
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Damn him!

582
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:23,500
Think him out of existence.

583
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,700
It is our duty to think
God out of existence.

584
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,500
It is our duty to insult Him.

585
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:33,100
Fuck you, God!

586
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:36,400
Strike me down
if you dare, you tyrant!

587
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:39,700
You non-existent fraud!

588
01:11:41,300 --> 01:11:43,500
It is the duty of all human beings

589
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:45,300
to think God out of existence.

590
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,700
Then we have a future.

591
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,700
Because then,
and only then,

592
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:53,300
do we take full responsibility
for who we are.

593
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,300
And that's what
you must do, Bubby!

594
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,500
Think God out of existence.

595
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:06,000
Take responsibility for who you are!

596
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:26,500
Fuck you, God!

597
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,700
Strike me down, if you dare!

598
01:12:35,700 --> 01:12:36,800
Fuck you, God.

599
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:38,700
Fuck you, God!

600
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:42,400
Strike me down, if you dare!

601
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:07,000
Hello!

602
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:25,700
- Hello!
- Hello!

603
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:33,300
- Hello!
- Hello.

604
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,900
- What're you doing?!
- Bubby good boy.

605
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,500
Let's get him!

606
01:13:40,700 --> 01:13:42,000
- You pervert!
- Son of a bitch!

607
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,500
You be's right...

608
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:02,600
You be right, Mum...

609
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:23,200
Bubby no fit
no more out there.

610
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,900
#Tell you a story

611
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,200
#Sad but true

612
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:12,500
#Tell you a story
#about you know who

613
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,600
#Bad Boy Bubby

614
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,700
#Bad Boy Bubby Blues

615
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,800
#Tell you a story
#about you know who

616
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:42,500
#A boy called Bubby

617
01:17:43,700 --> 01:17:45,600
#sitting right over there...

618
01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,000
#Bad Boy Bubby
#with the wild, crazy hair...

619
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,200
Yeah, wherever you want.

620
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:32,500
Anything to drink...?

621
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:35,100
...father?

622
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:41,200
Pizza.

623
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:45,000
Got any money?

624
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:46,500
Money...

625
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:53,600
That's all there is.

626
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:55,400
Then you just want pizza?

627
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:57,400
Pizza.

628
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,100
Well, what sort of pizza?

629
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:02,700
Pizza!

630
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:04,100
Alright!

631
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,200
No trouble, okay?

632
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,000
Pop no trouble be.

633
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,400
Alright, Pop.

634
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:14,000
Keep your money.

635
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,500
Cat!

636
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,200
Good cat.

637
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:07,800
Good cat.

638
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,900
Don't move, you little cunt!

639
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,000
I'll beat you brainless, by... Christ...

640
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:38,300
Good cat.

641
01:21:40,700 --> 01:21:41,800
Don't go, cat.

642
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:43,200
Stay!

643
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:45,000
Bubby get pizza for Cat!

644
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,600
Pizza!

645
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:48,000
Don't go!
Stay!

646
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:49,700
Good cat!
Stay!

647
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:52,300
Don't go!
Pizza!

648
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,000
Can you spare a buck, mate?

649
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,500
Fifty cents then?

650
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:09,000
Alright, then twenty?

651
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:11,500
You got any money at all?

652
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,000
That's all there is!

653
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:18,200
That all?

654
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,400
Oh...

655
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,200
Let me buy youse a drink!

656
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,200
Paul!

657
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:29,500
That be Paul!

658
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,300
Ungrateful bastard!

659
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,100
#A place where nothing ever ends

660
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:43,800
#Where feelings never fall asleep

661
01:22:47,700 --> 01:22:49,900
#Just like in a miracle

662
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:53,800
#You'll find her, you'll see her

663
01:22:54,000 --> 01:22:59,000
#There, between the silence and the sleep

664
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:02,100
#Want her
#Be hers

665
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:06,500
#There, between the fallen and the dream

666
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,000
Get him!

667
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:29,100
Get him!

668
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,100
Jesus Christ!

669
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:35,700
Get that fucking thing out
of here, you mad bastard!

670
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,200
Get off the fucking road,
you greenie bastard!

671
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,900
Look at the silly bastard,
would you?

672
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:50,300
You poofter bastard!

673
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,500
Hey, son!

674
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,000
You can call me Pop!

675
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,000
I'm your Pop!

676
01:23:59,100 --> 01:24:00,100
Hey, Pop!

677
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:01,600
Hello, son.

678
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:02,600
Hello, Pop!

679
01:24:02,600 --> 01:24:03,600
Yeah, yeah, that'll do!

680
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,500
Don't go making
a big thing of it!

681
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:08,400
What's the matter
with you, son?

682
01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,600
You got a bit of a mental
condition or something?

683
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,500
Fucking kid's trying
to be me again.

684
01:24:14,600 --> 01:24:15,800
Shut the fuck up, kid!

685
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:21,000
You useless cunt!

686
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:22,700
Why don't you piss off?!

687
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:27,200
Leave Bubby alone...

688
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,300
Leave Bubby alone!

689
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:33,800
Fucking useless shit,
should've been left to die!

690
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:44,300
#You'll find her
#You'll see her

691
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:48,100
#There, between the silence and the sleep

692
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:51,500
#Want her
#Be hers

693
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:55,600
#There, between the fallen and the dream

694
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:43,200
Stocking up there, Bubby?

695
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:44,800
Not Bubby.

696
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:47,100
Me Pop now.

697
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:49,600
What's the pizza for, Pop?

698
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:51,100
Pizza for Cat.

699
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,000
You still got that bloody cat?

700
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,100
Don't worry about it, Bubby.

701
01:25:55,100 --> 01:25:56,700
We'll get you more
pizza tomorrow.

702
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,100
Pop get pizza for Cat now!

703
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,100
Hey, you can't go anywhere!

704
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,500
We need you tomorrow night.
You're part of the band now!

705
01:26:04,500 --> 01:26:05,500
Cat hungry!

706
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:07,200
Wait a minute, Bubby.

707
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,900
Look, Pop. Just wait.

708
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,300
Tonight, you were good.

709
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:11,800
They loved you out there.

710
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:13,500
And you loved it out there.

711
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,300
We want you to do it
every night.

712
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,500
Tomorrow night, and the next.

713
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,000
Okay?

714
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,200
It's a regular gig here.

715
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:22,900
Stay with us,
we'll look after you.

716
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:26,000
For sure!

717
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:33,000
Pop give pizza to Cat.

718
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,200
We'll take you wherever
the bloody cat is!

719
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,300
No!

720
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,800
No.

721
01:26:41,200 --> 01:26:42,300
Pop go to Cat!

722
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:44,100
Pop sleep with Cat.

723
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:46,600
Come on, we can't just let him go.
We'll never see him again.

724
01:26:46,600 --> 01:26:47,800
We can't force him to stay.

725
01:26:49,100 --> 01:26:50,100
Bubby, please!

726
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,000
Bubby been left to die.

727
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:54,100
Me Pop now!

728
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,600
And don't lose it!

729
01:26:56,700 --> 01:26:58,500
Remember: when it gets dark,
give the note to someone,

730
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,400
they'll bring you
back here, we'll pay!

731
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:02,700
What's going on?
Go back to your woman.

732
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:04,700
I hope he makes it back.

733
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:07,100
Gonna be a dull gig
tomorrow, if he doesn't.

734
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,200
See you!

735
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:12,400
Fucking bit me!

736
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:14,000
Kill the fucking thing!

737
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,200
Break its fucking neck!

738
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:18,000
Fucking cat made me bleed!

739
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,100
Leave Cat alone!

740
01:27:27,300 --> 01:27:28,300
Cat!

741
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,200
Pop got pizza!

742
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,400
Come on, Cat.

743
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:45,000
Pizza!

744
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:04,900
Don't be still, Cat!

745
01:28:28,400 --> 01:28:29,600
She say Cat be dead.

746
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:35,000
Is Cat dead?

747
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:36,900
Yes. Cat's dead.

748
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:46,400
What did she say?

749
01:28:46,500 --> 01:28:48,500
She say you name be Angel.

750
01:28:49,700 --> 01:28:50,800
Oh, my God!

751
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,000
You understand them!

752
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,600
You understand what she said!

753
01:28:57,700 --> 01:28:59,700
You must have more
names than just Pop!

754
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,400
Pop!

755
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:03,800
Me be Pop!

756
01:29:04,300 --> 01:29:05,800
You can call me Pop!

757
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,500
Pop, we just want to find out
where you come from.

758
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:10,800
Where do you live?

759
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,700
Pop don't know.

760
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:15,800
Bubby don't know.

761
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,200
Do you think he might be schizo?

762
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:20,100
I don't think he's anything...
He's just a... kid!

763
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,200
Bubby a big weird kid!

764
01:29:22,200 --> 01:29:23,700
Christ, kid! You're a weirdo!

765
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:26,000
Pop not a kid!

766
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:31,800
If we take him anywhere,
they're going to lock him up!

767
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:34,400
And I feel he shouldn't
be locked up!

768
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:39,400
What is it, Rachael?

769
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:41,900
She think me should stay!

770
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,800
Is that what you
think, Rachael?

771
01:29:53,700 --> 01:29:54,900
What about the others?

772
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:56,500
What do you think?

773
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:57,700
Do you want Pop to stay?

774
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:00,200
Yes. Yes!

775
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,000
Well, I'm sure you've got
some stories to tell!

776
01:30:11,100 --> 01:30:12,700
Like who's Bubby,
for instance?

777
01:30:15,900 --> 01:30:17,000
You're Bubby, aren't you?

778
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:18,700
Bubby been left to die!

779
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:20,800
Me Pop now!

780
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,400
Oh...

781
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,400
Pop want to see Angel's tits!

782
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:32,000
No.

783
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:35,300
But I'll show Bubby!

784
01:30:38,200 --> 01:30:39,800
Bubby want to see Angel's tits!

785
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,000
I don't hear Bubby!

786
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,800
Bubby no fit no more out here!

787
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,400
Me Bubby.

788
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:10,200
Them be beautiful.

789
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:14,000
Like Mum.

790
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,900
Don't you think
they're too big?

791
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:21,600
Them be perfection!

792
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:25,500
Okay...

793
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:27,700
It's enough for now...

794
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:29,700
You go back to being Pop.

795
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:32,300
And Bubby's our secret.

796
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:34,300
Okay?

797
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,900
It's a garden, and
it's filled with roses...

798
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,400
All different colours...

799
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,800
And it smells so
beatiful in the garden.

800
01:31:52,100 --> 01:31:53,800
It is a very special garden.

801
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,600
No one knows about this garden...

802
01:32:00,100 --> 01:32:01,900
No one is allowed to come in.

803
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:05,100
Only people who love you.

804
01:32:06,300 --> 01:32:07,700
Only people who care

805
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:08,800
about you.

806
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,100
And only people
you want to let in.

807
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:16,200
There's a very high picket fence

808
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:17,800
around the garden...

809
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:20,400
Hidden in the high grass...

810
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:22,800
And no one can see it.

811
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:28,000
Imagine yourself being
in that garden...

812
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,200
lying on the grass...

813
01:32:33,100 --> 01:32:35,000
feeling very comfortable.

814
01:32:37,100 --> 01:32:38,500
It's a beautiful day.

815
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:42,100
The sun is shining...

816
01:32:43,300 --> 01:32:44,400
and it's warm.

817
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:49,100
And the wind gently
touches your cheeks...

818
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:50,700
Hi.

819
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:53,800
I'm off duty now, so I'm going to
show you where you'll be sleeping.

820
01:32:58,300 --> 01:33:00,500
Rachael think Pop
stay in her room.

821
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:04,000
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

822
01:33:06,500 --> 01:33:09,400
Sorry, Rachael, but Pop
will stay in Pandy's room.

823
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,700
Okay?

824
01:33:13,300 --> 01:33:14,200
Here's your bed

825
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:15,200
and there's your suitcase

826
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:16,900
and I put your cat
in the freezer,

827
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,800
we can bury that
tomorrow, okay?

828
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:32,100
A band?

829
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:42,300
Cat got your tongue?

830
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:44,500
It's the Animal for you!

831
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:20,600
Psst! Pop!

832
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:23,200
Come here!

833
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:29,900
We've got a surprise for you!

834
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,800
We've got some people who'd
really like to get to know you!

835
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,000
Come on, come on!

836
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,100
Go, get'em, Pop!

837
01:34:43,300 --> 01:34:44,400
Is that you, Pop?

838
01:34:44,400 --> 01:34:45,500
Me be Pop!

839
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:50,000
I'm Shannon!

840
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:51,500
I'm Sharon!

841
01:34:52,200 --> 01:34:53,400
Won't you join us?

842
01:34:57,700 --> 01:34:58,700
What do you think?

843
01:34:58,700 --> 01:34:59,800
Do you like us?

844
01:35:02,100 --> 01:35:03,500
I've never had a virgin before!

845
01:35:05,500 --> 01:35:06,700
Don't be scared!

846
01:35:06,900 --> 01:35:08,200
We'll show you what to do!

847
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:12,900
Tiny tits...

848
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,100
Tiny?!

849
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,300
These aren't tiny,
they're perfect 36's!

850
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,800
Where did you come from?

851
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,100
Them not Angel tits.

852
01:35:27,200 --> 01:35:28,200
Who's Angel?

853
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:29,200
I don't know...

854
01:35:30,800 --> 01:35:33,100
Ashes to ashes,
and dust to dust.

855
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:36,800
Good-bye, Cat.

856
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,400
There...

857
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:41,700
She's happy with God now!

858
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:46,900
It is the duty of all human beings

859
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,900
to think God out of existence.

860
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:53,200
Full of surprises, aren't we...

861
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,100
Be still, Kat!

862
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,600
I'll beat you brainless,
by Christ!

863
01:36:22,600 --> 01:36:24,700
Poison don't get you...

864
01:36:25,000 --> 01:36:27,100
God will...!

865
01:36:59,800 --> 01:37:01,300
Them not tiny tits!

866
01:37:03,200 --> 01:37:05,500
Them great big
whoppers of things!

867
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:09,100
Pop love them tits!

868
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:14,600
Pop love them tits!

869
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,600
No.

870
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:47,100
No!

871
01:37:51,600 --> 01:37:52,600
That not be.

872
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:08,200
Not be...

873
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:55,100
What's the matter, Bubby?

874
01:38:58,600 --> 01:39:01,400
Bubby crying with
sadness for Rachael...

875
01:39:02,600 --> 01:39:04,400
because Rachael
have no Bubby.

876
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:11,700
Rachael...

877
01:39:12,400 --> 01:39:14,000
be loving Bubby.

878
01:39:17,200 --> 01:39:19,400
Oh, my poor Rachael...

879
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,400
And Bubby be loving Angel...

880
01:39:29,700 --> 01:39:30,800
Oh, Bubby...

881
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,700
I only really visit
when I have to.

882
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:48,000
It always ends in a fight.

883
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:49,800
And then I don't
go for a while...

884
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,400
And then they forgive me,

885
01:39:51,500 --> 01:39:53,000
then we fight all over again.

886
01:39:59,500 --> 01:40:01,000
A bit of a mess

887
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,300
but dad's a collector.

888
01:40:02,300 --> 01:40:03,500
Used to be his business.

889
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:06,700
Princess Pink!

890
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:14,600
This is going to be fun...

891
01:40:43,700 --> 01:40:45,500
How do you like
your dinner, Mr Pop?

892
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:49,000
Pizza be better than this.

893
01:40:54,100 --> 01:40:56,500
Our daughter has a healthy
appetite, don't you think?

894
01:40:56,600 --> 01:40:57,600
Mother, don't start.

895
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,200
Be quiet! Let your mother
speak uninterrupted!

896
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:01,300
Thank you, dear!

897
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,000
We tried to bring her up
as best as we could

898
01:41:05,100 --> 01:41:08,000
but she's been rather
a disappointment to us.

899
01:41:11,200 --> 01:41:13,500
Be the first time you
didn't finish your dinner!

900
01:41:14,900 --> 01:41:17,200
I find fat people so...

901
01:41:18,000 --> 01:41:19,200
so gross!

902
01:41:19,900 --> 01:41:21,400
So unfortunate, of course

903
01:41:21,500 --> 01:41:23,000
but so...

904
01:41:23,500 --> 01:41:24,600
ugly...

905
01:41:27,000 --> 01:41:28,400
And what do you think, Mr Pop?

906
01:41:29,600 --> 01:41:31,600
Me think Angel be beautiful.

907
01:41:31,700 --> 01:41:33,200
She's a fat slut!

908
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,700
Be careful what you say, dear!

909
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,800
Better he'd know that
she's a fat slut!

910
01:41:43,400 --> 01:41:45,300
If God had wanted
us to be fat

911
01:41:45,400 --> 01:41:48,000
he'd have made us all
the same weight, wouldn't he?

912
01:41:48,300 --> 01:41:49,700
But he didn't!

913
01:41:50,100 --> 01:41:52,500
God doesn't like fat people!

914
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:56,300
Fat people are an
abomination in his eyes!

915
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,100
Fuck you, God!

916
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,500
Strike me down, if you dare!

917
01:42:02,600 --> 01:42:04,300
Angel be beautiful!

918
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:07,400
God be a useless cunt!

919
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:13,100
NO!

920
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:16,300
Why you be bad to Angel?

921
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:20,700
You can go now, Mr Pop!

922
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:23,800
We shall pray for you!

923
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,400
Get out of here!

924
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,100
Angel come too?

925
01:43:23,600 --> 01:43:25,700
My parents were just waiting
to die anyway, Bubby.

926
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:31,700
They were both riddled
with poisons and cancers...

927
01:43:33,400 --> 01:43:35,700
Asbestos from the break linings...

928
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:38,200
Lead from the car exhaust.

929
01:43:39,000 --> 01:43:40,900
PCP's from the car seats.

930
01:43:42,900 --> 01:43:44,200
Dioxins,

931
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:45,200
parathidions,

932
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:46,400
dieldrin...

933
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:48,700
Mercury.

934
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,600
Radioactivity.

935
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:57,200
Whoever did it, just
put them out of their misery.

936
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,200
Ashes to ashes...

937
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,500
dust to dust.

938
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:11,900
That be nice.

939
01:44:15,100 --> 01:44:17,000
That be poisoning us!

940
01:44:18,300 --> 01:44:20,300
That be poisoning the air
that we breathe!

941
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,300
If the poison don't get you...

942
01:44:28,900 --> 01:44:30,100
then God will!

943
01:44:55,800 --> 01:44:56,900
Beautiful, isn't it?

944
01:44:58,100 --> 01:44:59,100
Fantastic.

945
01:44:59,400 --> 01:45:00,500
And yet...

946
01:45:00,600 --> 01:45:02,700
This is mob have been
trying for centuries

947
01:45:04,100 --> 01:45:05,400
to clingwrap this mob.

948
01:45:06,000 --> 01:45:08,000
Even though they
share the same god.

949
01:45:09,200 --> 01:45:10,200
Mind you,

950
01:45:10,300 --> 01:45:12,700
this mob have been getting
pretty good at clingwrapping lately.

951
01:45:16,700 --> 01:45:18,800
And this mob's got
the same god as well.

952
01:45:20,100 --> 01:45:22,700
But they've had a fair go of
clingwrapping that first mob...

953
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:25,300
They've been trying to clingwrap

954
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,200
that second mob for a good
couple of thousand years.

955
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:31,500
And they pretty well
ucceeded in clingwrapping

956
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:33,700
just about all of this mob.

957
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:36,600
They never did much
clingwrapping...

958
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,300
to anyone...

959
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:40,300
but themselves.

960
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,000
Then there's this lot.

961
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:47,000
A different god altogether.

962
01:45:48,700 --> 01:45:50,000
You'd think that would help.

963
01:45:50,700 --> 01:45:51,800
But it doesn't.

964
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:53,800
See, this mob

965
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,300
clingwrapped about half a million

966
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:57,600
of that first mob.

967
01:45:58,700 --> 01:46:00,200
Fourty or fifty years ago.

968
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:03,700
And they've been at it ever since.

969
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:07,800
They've all done their
fair share of killing

970
01:46:07,900 --> 01:46:09,400
or being killed.

971
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,000
And it's all pointless.

972
01:46:12,900 --> 01:46:14,200
The thing, Bubby, is:

973
01:46:14,300 --> 01:46:15,700
don't be like them.

974
01:46:16,500 --> 01:46:19,000
No matter how mad you
get at someone...

975
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,400
don't kill them.

976
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:22,900
Ever.

977
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:27,100
Bubby done clingwrap them.

978
01:46:28,500 --> 01:46:29,700
Me Pop now!

979
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:32,300
Talking like you'll be running
the country soon enough...

980
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,400
No more excuses!

981
01:46:35,100 --> 01:46:36,400
No more clingwrapping.

982
01:46:37,800 --> 01:46:38,900
Okay?

983
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:44,800
Bubby?

984
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,400
Okay.

985
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:52,100
And...

986
01:46:52,900 --> 01:46:54,600
don't mention it to anyone.

987
01:46:54,600 --> 01:46:56,100
We look like all being...

988
01:46:56,200 --> 01:46:58,400
rich and famous
soon enough, so...

989
01:46:59,100 --> 01:47:00,500
let's not spoil it.

990
01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:03,400
Okay.

991
01:47:14,300 --> 01:47:15,400
Collars!

992
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:17,300
Yes, mate?

993
01:47:17,400 --> 01:47:18,400
How much that be?

994
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,600
That be five dollar!

995
01:47:20,100 --> 01:47:21,200
Where be Pop?

996
01:47:21,700 --> 01:47:22,600
Where be Pop?

997
01:47:22,700 --> 01:47:24,000
When be them come on stage?

998
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:26,000
Them be there soon!
Them be there real soon!

999
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,800
Where be Pop!
