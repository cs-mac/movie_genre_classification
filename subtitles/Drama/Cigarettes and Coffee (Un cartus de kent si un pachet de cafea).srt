1
00:00:43,253 --> 00:00:45,755
Take these handcuffs off!

2
00:00:52,262 --> 00:00:54,430
Think you can shut me up?

3
00:00:54,598 --> 00:00:58,350
Go fuck yourself!
Take off these handcuffs, faggot!

4
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:02,730
I'll remember you two cunts!

5
00:01:04,024 --> 00:01:05,066
Easy!

6
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:11,906
Don't touch me! Hands off!

7
00:01:12,074 --> 00:01:13,908
I can walk by myself.

8
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:15,785
Fuck off, asshole.

9
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:17,828
Where are you taking me?

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,456
Take off the handcuffs first.

11
00:01:20,582 --> 00:01:24,126
Take them off.
Or I won't go in there.

12
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:25,753
How dumb do I look?

13
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:27,838
Take off these handcuffs!

14
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,105
So Malik, are you listening?

15
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:46,524
Do you understand me?

16
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,609
I understand I got 6 years.

17
00:01:48,777 --> 00:01:51,570
You're an adult now.
You go to prison.

18
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,490
You're in with the big guys.

19
00:01:57,327 --> 00:01:58,953
Here... Sign here.

20
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:00,871
What is it?

21
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:02,498
For legal aid.

22
00:02:03,083 --> 00:02:05,000
- Is it money?
- Money for me.

23
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:07,711
So I get reimbursed.
Sign here.

24
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,088
Money for you?

25
00:02:23,103 --> 00:02:24,353
Thank you.

26
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:20,409
Hands up.

27
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:22,620
Higher.

28
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,706
Palms out. Shake your hair.

29
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,583
Mouth open.

30
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,126
Tongue out.

31
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:30,586
Turn around.

32
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,214
Bottom of your feet.

33
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,381
The other.

34
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:35,424
Bend over.

35
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,176
Cough.

36
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:43,057
No money in here.

37
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,017
For when you get out.

38
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,645
Give him a uniform and shoes.

39
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,731
These are garbage.
Can't have them here.

40
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,734
Any family on the outside?

41
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:54,652
No, sir.

42
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:57,738
- No one to wire you money?
- No, sir.

43
00:03:58,114 --> 00:03:59,823
Friends inside, or enemies?

44
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:01,742
No one, sir.

45
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:04,995
You start under observation.

46
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,331
So we can make an evaluation.

47
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:09,750
See how you fit in.

48
00:04:09,918 --> 00:04:12,336
Then you'll get a permanent cell.

49
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,255
Are you religious?

50
00:04:15,548 --> 00:04:16,757
Your religion.

51
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:19,260
Do you go to prayers?

52
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,887
Any dietary requirements?

53
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:25,015
Nothing unusual, sir.

54
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:26,350
Do you eat pork?

55
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:28,352
No. Yeah...

56
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:33,607
How will you get money wired to you?

57
00:04:34,985 --> 00:04:35,859
I don't know.

58
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,236
You want to work?

59
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,826
- What do you do besides attacking cops?
- I didn't do a thing!

60
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:46,787
Vocational training? Anything?

61
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,088
Keep to the side, please.

62
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:18,796
Boss!

63
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:56,917
You the new guy?

64
00:06:57,252 --> 00:06:58,544
You're in the workshop.

65
00:06:59,421 --> 00:07:01,255
Got anything from outside?

66
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,632
Cell phone, hash, pills?

67
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,176
What the hell? I got nothing at all.

68
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:09,179
You get money orders?
Any friends outside?

69
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:10,931
What do you want?

70
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,517
I want your sneakers. They're nice.

71
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,602
Can I have them?
I'll give you flip-flops.

72
00:07:15,812 --> 00:07:17,271
Go fuck yourself.

73
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,569
Faggot!

74
00:07:55,059 --> 00:07:56,602
Dirty bastard!

75
00:08:00,023 --> 00:08:02,816
In your cells. Lock-up time.

76
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:13,160
Lock-up time.

77
00:08:28,301 --> 00:08:29,176
Line up.

78
00:08:35,683 --> 00:08:36,433
Cesar!

79
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:40,312
Go get Cesar!

80
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,486
The guy on the right.

81
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:51,281
Why is that dirty Arab here?

82
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:54,159
They probably brought him in
for the Farraldo trial.

83
00:09:09,092 --> 00:09:10,634
Luciani. Infirmary.

84
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:23,897
Luciani. Consultation.

85
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:48,589
So?

86
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:52,593
They brought him in
for the Farraldo trial.

87
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:55,137
His lawyer plea bargained.

88
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:57,431
Got a lesser sentence.

89
00:09:58,099 --> 00:09:59,766
He's here till the trial.

90
00:10:02,145 --> 00:10:04,605
Jacky Marcaggi
wants you to bump him.

91
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,942
When is the trial?

92
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,694
The 14th.

93
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:12,487
In ten days?

94
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:13,822
Short notice.

95
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,367
Does he suspect anything?

96
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:18,577
The usual.

97
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:22,039
Like any rat.
He asked to transfer to the Muslims.

98
00:10:23,207 --> 00:10:24,791
And if he gets solitary,

99
00:10:25,168 --> 00:10:26,793
we lose our chance.

100
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,138
He stays in his cell all day.

101
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:42,392
Sees no one.
Never goes out. Doesn't eat.

102
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:46,563
He requested cellblock B
with the Muslims.

103
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,736
We have to do it
in his temp cell.

104
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,071
Hit and run?

105
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,740
We can't risk one of ours.

106
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,660
Keep your ears open.
We'll find a way.

107
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,244
Any contacts in A?

108
00:11:01,412 --> 00:11:03,288
Besides the porter, no one.

109
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:06,667
Open up! Dinner!

110
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,253
The door should already be open.

111
00:11:10,421 --> 00:11:11,171
Yeah, I know.

112
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,590
- Not eating?
- No. Just some bread.

113
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:14,758
Bread.

114
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,220
The other one.

115
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:21,556
Enjoy.

116
00:11:21,891 --> 00:11:23,767
- When is mail?
- Morning.

117
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,901
- How's it going?
- Fine.

118
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:35,237
Bread?

119
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:37,280
Enjoy.

120
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:09,604
What the fuck?

121
00:12:09,731 --> 00:12:10,731
I recognize you.

122
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,315
We're neighbors.

123
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:13,900
What's your name?

124
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:15,527
What's it to you?

125
00:12:16,904 --> 00:12:18,905
What block were you assigned to?

126
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:20,699
You know yours?

127
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:22,576
Yeah, B.

128
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,037
Ask for B.
It's for us brothers.

129
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:28,415
Come closer.

130
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:31,293
I said come closer.

131
00:12:33,296 --> 00:12:34,588
Want some hash?

132
00:12:35,423 --> 00:12:37,340
Yeah, hash. Yes or no?

133
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:39,926
Yeah but.. I have no money.

134
00:12:40,094 --> 00:12:41,678
We'll work it out.

135
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,096
What do you mean?

136
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:46,767
I'll bribe a guard
and you come suck me.

137
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,268
- What?
- Suck me off.

138
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:50,312
Fuck off, asshole!

139
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,106
I should suck you?
Motherfucker!

140
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:54,900
Go fuck yourself!

141
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:56,568
Shut your face!

142
00:12:56,736 --> 00:12:57,861
Faggot!

143
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,330
You okay?

144
00:13:51,374 --> 00:13:52,666
See you in the yard.

145
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,035
This way.

146
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:33,790
How old are you?

147
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:36,042
19. Why?

148
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:39,087
Don't look at me.
Look at the guy next to me.

149
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:40,881
Look at me.

150
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,799
I hear you got 6 years.

151
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:44,509
That's a long time.

152
00:14:45,052 --> 00:14:48,221
You think you can last here
without protection?

153
00:14:48,431 --> 00:14:49,764
I'll manage.

154
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,186
- What do you want?
- To protect you.

155
00:14:55,855 --> 00:14:57,898
- You speak Arabic?
- Sure I do.

156
00:14:58,065 --> 00:15:00,066
The guy in the shower yesterday...

157
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:03,069
You know him?

158
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,447
What did he want?

159
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:07,657
He wanted to talk.

160
00:15:08,743 --> 00:15:10,285
Don't look at me, I said.

161
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:12,954
I want you to keep it up.

162
00:15:13,456 --> 00:15:15,707
Get close with him, make friends.

163
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:18,376
Why?

164
00:15:19,462 --> 00:15:20,921
You're going to kill him.

165
00:15:21,297 --> 00:15:22,380
Let him go.

166
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:24,591
Come closer.

167
00:15:25,468 --> 00:15:26,968
Closer. Next to him.

168
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:31,056
You can handle it.

169
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:34,893
You won't be alone. We'll help.

170
00:15:36,604 --> 00:15:38,396
Just remember one thing.

171
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:42,859
Now that you're in on it,
if you don't kill him, I kill you.

172
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,780
Okay, now beat it.

173
00:15:49,575 --> 00:15:50,659
Got it?

174
00:15:51,285 --> 00:15:53,745
Beat it and keep quiet, understood?

175
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,999
I can't kill anyone...

176
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:23,984
Yes?

177
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,819
Can I speak to the director?

178
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:29,656
There's a procedure.
First you request an appointment.

179
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,577
The warden...

180
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:41,793
Can I talk to the warden? Right now.

181
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,878
- What for?
- I need him!

182
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:46,673
Let me check.

183
00:16:59,562 --> 00:17:00,812
I have a problem.

184
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:21,875
We run this place.
What do you want from us?

185
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,586
Nothing?
So shut up and do as we say.

186
00:17:51,614 --> 00:17:55,325
Reyeb is wary.
He won't let you in so easily.

187
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:57,619
Are you listening?

188
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,287
I'll start over.

189
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:00,872
Are you watching?

190
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,750
He won't let you in easily.

191
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:06,294
You can't be carrying anything.

192
00:18:06,462 --> 00:18:10,256
Talk to him. Act natural.
About your mother, visitors...

193
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,883
Talk normally.

194
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,302
Cut here.

195
00:18:17,807 --> 00:18:19,307
You stroke his balls.

196
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,980
Put a hand on his shoulder.

197
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:30,860
Spring up and do it. Get it?

198
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:38,868
So it's okay for the hash.

199
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,497
Can't hear you!

200
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:46,000
It's okay for the hash.

201
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:49,254
Okay, I'll tell the hack.

202
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,506
Step back.

203
00:18:51,674 --> 00:18:52,757
What?

204
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,676
Step back, I said.

205
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:57,095
Turn around.

206
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,517
Turn around!

207
00:19:04,687 --> 00:19:06,020
Lower your hands.

208
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:32,649
Guard!

209
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,544
Is that him?

210
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,759
El Djebena, move it!

211
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:01,052
Give us a minute.

212
00:21:10,896 --> 00:21:12,605
Trouble in the workshop?

213
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:17,860
- What did he do?
- Kicked a guy.

214
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:20,363
You kicked a guy?

215
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,408
What did he do to you?

216
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:25,868
Nothing?

217
00:21:27,579 --> 00:21:29,956
He did nothing and you kicked him?

218
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:33,209
Know what I think?

219
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:36,587
You did it to go to the hole.

220
00:21:37,256 --> 00:21:38,339
Am I wrong?

221
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,760
Think we won't call on you there
to do what we asked?

222
00:21:43,137 --> 00:21:44,095
Is that it?

223
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:48,808
Bitch!

224
00:21:50,185 --> 00:21:51,853
Piece of shit!

225
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:53,146
Asshole!

226
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:58,401
Stop it, Cesar!

227
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,998
He's going to bleed, so watch out.

228
00:22:13,375 --> 00:22:15,376
Check the bottom of your shoes.

229
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:19,297
Leave the blade in his hand.

230
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:25,511
Your turn now.
You be the girl.

231
00:22:34,938 --> 00:22:37,106
Try harder or it'll never work!

232
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,036
Go on.

233
00:22:58,087 --> 00:22:59,003
Good.

234
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:47,760
Let's go.

235
00:24:11,743 --> 00:24:12,368
Come in.

236
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:15,037
Don't move.

237
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:23,629
Hands up.

238
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,548
Hands up, I said!

239
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,261
Sorry, not everyone here is a friend.

240
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:37,560
I call the shots.

241
00:24:40,439 --> 00:24:41,606
Sit down.

242
00:24:42,441 --> 00:24:43,941
There, on the bed.

243
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:45,318
The bed, I said!

244
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:48,988
Want something?

245
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:50,031
Water?

246
00:24:50,199 --> 00:24:51,282
Kawa?

247
00:24:52,201 --> 00:24:53,201
Coffee.

248
00:25:02,794 --> 00:25:04,128
Interested?

249
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:05,963
- In what?
- The books.

250
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:08,549
Like to read?

251
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:10,635
I don't know.

252
00:25:10,886 --> 00:25:12,220
Don't know what?

253
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,640
You can't read, right?

254
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,476
It's not too late.

255
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:20,478
There's a prison school.

256
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,688
You can learn in here.

257
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,650
Sugar?

258
00:25:30,072 --> 00:25:32,615
The idea is to leave here
a little smarter.

259
00:25:54,263 --> 00:25:55,221
Here.

260
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:04,730
I see you in the yard.

261
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,691
Always by yourself.

262
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,859
Always in the same clothes.

263
00:26:09,611 --> 00:26:11,862
No friends here? No one?

264
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,117
I'm in transit.

265
00:26:16,827 --> 00:26:18,160
Just passing through.

266
00:26:18,954 --> 00:26:20,746
I can leave you some books.

267
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:23,207
You can always learn to read.

268
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,337
Shut your fucking trap!

269
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:38,097
You okay?

270
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:44,061
Are you okay?

271
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,440
What are you doing?

272
00:26:48,734 --> 00:26:49,442
Come.

273
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,880
From Cesar Luciani.

274
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,633
You're now under his protection.

275
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,636
I saw your form.
You barely filled it out.

276
00:30:45,804 --> 00:30:47,012
Are you interested?

277
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,307
So why not fill it out?

278
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:53,185
I don't understand.

279
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,687
Want to learn?

280
00:30:57,524 --> 00:31:00,818
You wrote your name,
so you can write a little.

281
00:31:01,736 --> 00:31:02,820
Yeah, a little.

282
00:31:02,988 --> 00:31:04,488
When did you stop school?

283
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:05,906
When I was 11.

284
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,743
Can you recognize an "Exit" sign?

285
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:15,249
French your mother tongue?

286
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,545
With your parents
was it French, Arabic?

287
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:23,674
I wasn't with them.

288
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,801
Which did you speak first?

289
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,345
Both.

290
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,557
Where was your school?

291
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:33,851
The juvenile center.

292
00:31:35,103 --> 00:31:39,273
There's a word with an "A",
but it's not pronounced.

293
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:40,691
The fourth word.

294
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,527
The fourth word. Which word is that?

295
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:45,362
"Dans".

296
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,657
Let's go back to the second word.

297
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,285
The second word... Go on...

298
00:31:51,453 --> 00:31:52,369
"Canard."

299
00:31:53,371 --> 00:31:57,875
This word contains two syllables.

300
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:00,044
"Ca...

301
00:32:00,712 --> 00:32:01,629
nard."

302
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:06,175
Repeat it for me,
separating both syllables.

303
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:09,386
Great.

304
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,765
In the first syllable,

305
00:32:12,974 --> 00:32:16,268
is the "A" in the beginning

306
00:32:16,436 --> 00:32:18,228
or at the end?

307
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,814
Happy birthday, brother.

308
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:50,988
1 YEAR

309
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:32,780
Stop it! Stop it!

310
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,699
Aren't you ashamed?

311
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,393
Who's their security crew?

312
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:06,230
- You know them?
- Who?

313
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:07,648
The Muslims.

314
00:35:12,737 --> 00:35:14,279
These fucking Arabs!

315
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:17,241
At least dogs fuck in silence.

316
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:32,714
3 euros 40!

317
00:35:33,091 --> 00:35:35,050
How much is that?

318
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,219
How much in francs?

319
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:39,304
Money's money.

320
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,056
20 francs?

321
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,725
Give me the cookies.

322
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:45,519
Can you shop for me?

323
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,437
You bummed off me last time.

324
00:35:47,647 --> 00:35:49,189
- I didn't.
- Ask him!

325
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:50,440
What do you want?

326
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,068
Soap, granola and Coca Cola, please.

327
00:35:53,236 --> 00:35:54,820
- No Coke.
- Why not?

328
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:56,613
Not on my commissary card!

329
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,992
- But it's for me.
- Don't be a pain in the ass!

330
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:01,410
Stop bumming off us!

331
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:03,453
Bum off your people.

332
00:36:04,247 --> 00:36:05,998
Or your friends outside.

333
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:08,125
It pisses me off he's here!

334
00:36:08,293 --> 00:36:09,918
He's not one of us.

335
00:36:10,795 --> 00:36:12,546
Let him clean up if you want.

336
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:15,340
But when he's done, he's out.
Dirty Arab!

337
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,718
You done? Get out.

338
00:36:53,463 --> 00:36:54,671
Fuck off!

339
00:36:56,049 --> 00:36:57,174
Go fuck off.

340
00:36:57,342 --> 00:36:58,508
Dirty Arab!

341
00:37:11,689 --> 00:37:13,732
How much time do you have left?

342
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,070
Another two...

343
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,197
three years.

344
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,366
And you...

345
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,078
Rabbia: Rage.

346
00:37:26,621 --> 00:37:29,331
Rabbiosu.. In a rage, furious.

347
00:37:34,629 --> 00:37:35,754
Raccia ...

348
00:37:36,297 --> 00:37:37,381
To caw.

349
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:39,549
Who cares?

350
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,010
Radica: Root.

351
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:05,534
Electricity is like water in a circuit.

352
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:08,036
Whatever the size of the pipe,

353
00:38:08,204 --> 00:38:10,956
the flow-rate is constant.
Same here.

354
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:14,751
The current remains the same
at I1, I2 and I3.

355
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,004
You have to replace "he" by "we".

356
00:38:17,171 --> 00:38:17,963
Understand?

357
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,215
"He ate first." Go on.

358
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:21,758
"We eat first."

359
00:38:21,884 --> 00:38:26,430
You're right for "we", but "eat"...
What's the past tense?

360
00:38:30,935 --> 00:38:32,436
"We ate".

361
00:38:33,604 --> 00:38:37,649
Good job. "We ate" is the past.
Now try the subjunctive.

362
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:39,109
"Would...

363
00:38:40,153 --> 00:38:41,194
"that we eat."

364
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:42,612
People say that?

365
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,115
It's wild.
I never did but they do.

366
00:38:46,409 --> 00:38:49,661
One day I saw a job ad.
For security guard.

367
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:53,081
I didn't have a dog.
So I bought one secondhand.

368
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:55,959
I didn't know,
so I got a Rottweiler.

369
00:38:57,295 --> 00:39:00,589
Know what they're like?
And his name was Tyson.

370
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:04,176
He came with the name: Tyson.
He was humungous!

371
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:06,803
See this?

372
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:09,139
This was the size of his poops.

373
00:39:09,307 --> 00:39:12,809
He took enormous dumps...
Bigger than mine.

374
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:16,980
So I work in a store.
A big supermarket.

375
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:20,317
I leave the dog to sniff around.
I go outside.

376
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,902
For a cigarette.

377
00:39:22,653 --> 00:39:24,654
Then I try to go back in.

378
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,156
I couldn't.

379
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:29,284
He didn't always recognize me.

380
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:30,327
Your own dog?

381
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:33,663
But he was crazy.
Tyson was a psycho.

382
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:37,250
I go inside
and he comes charging towards me.

383
00:39:37,502 --> 00:39:39,294
I panic, reach out my arm.

384
00:39:39,462 --> 00:39:41,088
He grabs me like this.

385
00:39:41,297 --> 00:39:43,840
I take out my mace, spray him.

386
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:47,928
He lets go. I run out, scared shitless.
What do I do?

387
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:49,429
I leave him inside.

388
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:53,016
Soon the employees start coming.

389
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:56,853
I didn't know
they used a back door to go inside.

390
00:39:56,979 --> 00:39:58,939
The hound had a field day.

391
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,566
He tore every last one to pieces.

392
00:40:05,029 --> 00:40:07,489
He was like Karim in cellblock B.

393
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:13,120
Why are you here?

394
00:40:13,454 --> 00:40:14,538
Returning books.

395
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,873
Move it. You, come with me.

396
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:21,336
Why are you with him?

397
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
- He's a brother.
- He's a Corsican!

398
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,342
Dirty bastard!

399
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,385
Pig!

400
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:30,387
You calling me a pig?

401
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:33,557
Who's the pig?

402
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:35,225
Calling me a pig?

403
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:37,894
I'm a pig?

404
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,187
Let go of me!

405
00:40:43,526 --> 00:40:44,234
This isn't right!

406
00:40:44,402 --> 00:40:46,278
It's not Corsica here!

407
00:40:46,737 --> 00:40:48,613
You're being disrespectful.

408
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:56,455
El Djebena!

409
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,543
Tell your boss
there's a new hack to meet.

410
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,133
Got the papers?

411
00:41:08,301 --> 00:41:11,136
They're not in yet. I got the laundry.

412
00:41:11,971 --> 00:41:13,305
Make coffee.

413
00:41:13,473 --> 00:41:15,056
For everyone?

414
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:18,768
Did you see Ilbanez?

415
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:21,646
He'll come by later with the new hack.

416
00:41:35,953 --> 00:41:36,953
Luciani.

417
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,288
Vettori.

418
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:40,665
- Antarro.
- Santi.

419
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,375
- Ceccaldi.
- Profundi.

420
00:41:42,877 --> 00:41:43,877
Mosconi.

421
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:44,794
Pilicci.

422
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,796
- Valpato.
- Corleoni.

423
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:48,590
El Djebena.

424
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,518
Homeland Security announced

425
00:41:59,685 --> 00:42:03,355
that Corsicans will serve prison time
closer to home.

426
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:06,566
The ruling was made public today,

427
00:42:06,734 --> 00:42:11,321
the culmination of the reshuffling,
advocated by Nicolas Sarkozy,

428
00:42:11,531 --> 00:42:13,156
of France's political prisoners.

429
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:18,036
No comment, as of yet,
from the Corsican Nationalist Front.

430
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,329
Cesar!

431
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:30,799
You there?

432
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,386
Hear the news?

433
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:36,429
When do we get out?

434
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,724
When the law is cleared
at the cabinet meeting.

435
00:42:40,726 --> 00:42:42,060
Soon?

436
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:46,106
I have no idea.

437
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:52,404
Luciani. For Mr. Sampiero.

438
00:43:02,206 --> 00:43:05,000
I can at least tell you
who's not concerned.

439
00:43:05,876 --> 00:43:07,586
You're not. You know it.

440
00:43:09,589 --> 00:43:13,091
Pilicci, Antarro and Prof neither.
You all screwed up bad.

441
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:17,345
Back then
it wasn't called screwing up.

442
00:43:19,181 --> 00:43:22,267
Santi and Vettori
are up for parole, so for them...

443
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:28,648
You're saying
I'm going to die alone here.

444
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:31,109
Don't talk like that.

445
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:37,073
You're not alone.
You carry weight outside.

446
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:41,286
And here?

447
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:44,164
Here!

448
00:43:44,624 --> 00:43:48,126
Guard, I've put up 3 of these.
It's a lack of respect.

449
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:49,961
Seriously.

450
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,464
You work for Imam Moussab?

451
00:43:52,632 --> 00:43:56,176
He helps rehabilitate sick inmates.
He got me a job.

452
00:43:56,302 --> 00:44:00,472
I work for him a little.
Some day I'll have a real job.

453
00:44:00,848 --> 00:44:03,850
- You're sick?
- That's why I got pardoned.

454
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,226
You're leaving?

455
00:44:09,482 --> 00:44:10,440
You got AIDS?

456
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,985
Of course not! Don't say that.
Are you crazy?

457
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,825
What do you got?

458
00:44:21,410 --> 00:44:22,827
Testicle cancer.

459
00:44:24,497 --> 00:44:25,705
Cancer on your balls?

460
00:44:25,873 --> 00:44:28,958
Stop shouting!
Why not make an announcement?

461
00:44:29,126 --> 00:44:30,210
Besides, it's over.

462
00:44:30,503 --> 00:44:32,003
So you're better.

463
00:44:32,505 --> 00:44:34,255
Thank God. I am.

464
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:36,675
Does it hurt?

465
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:38,843
No, it doesn't.

466
00:44:39,095 --> 00:44:42,097
The chemotherapy hurts.
You lose your hair.

467
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:45,016
You feel like you're 80.
Always tired.

468
00:44:45,184 --> 00:44:49,187
Otherwise, thank God, it's over.
I can even have kids.

469
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,360
For your balls, brother.

470
00:44:55,528 --> 00:44:56,569
Good going.

471
00:44:58,864 --> 00:44:59,989
What's your sign?

472
00:45:00,324 --> 00:45:01,324
Cancer!

473
00:45:02,034 --> 00:45:03,868
I'm just teasing.

474
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:05,787
I'm Aries.

475
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:13,336
So long, Cesar!

476
00:45:13,879 --> 00:45:15,380
Take care, my friend!

477
00:45:17,133 --> 00:45:19,384
We won't forget you, Cesar!

478
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:23,930
Be strong, Volfoni!
See you in Bastia!

479
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:17,776
You keep the phone on you?

480
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:35,376
Why not leave it with someone else?

481
00:46:45,888 --> 00:46:47,055
I speak Corsican.

482
00:46:53,062 --> 00:46:54,479
I speak your language.

483
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:00,235
When I was on the phone,

484
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,779
did you understand?

485
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:04,864
You spoke to a "lawer".

486
00:47:05,574 --> 00:47:06,991
A what?

487
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:10,495
A lawyer?

488
00:47:13,499 --> 00:47:14,666
Who taught you?

489
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:17,335
You... and the others.

490
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,045
I was watching,
listening.

491
00:47:20,506 --> 00:47:22,173
You mean spying.

492
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,092
I wasn't spying at all.

493
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,802
I was learning. Listening.

494
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,428
You were here...

495
00:47:28,514 --> 00:47:32,225
If you weren't spying,
what were you doing? Making fun?

496
00:47:33,477 --> 00:47:36,646
If I was making fun,
I'd never have told you.

497
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:38,022
So why tell me?

498
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,733
Because the others left?

499
00:47:42,194 --> 00:47:44,028
Look at me, you Arab!

500
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,197
Because the others left?

501
00:47:46,365 --> 00:47:47,532
Right?

502
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:48,366
Yeah.

503
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,662
Does anyone else know?

504
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:02,213
It has a life of its own.

505
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:04,340
Come sit down.

506
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,925
Sit your ass down!

507
00:48:18,105 --> 00:48:19,397
You keep it now.

508
00:48:21,275 --> 00:48:23,318
Hold onto it but don't use it.

509
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:26,070
All hacks aren't like Ilbanez.

510
00:48:27,156 --> 00:48:29,115
If they find it,
you do hole time.

511
00:48:30,576 --> 00:48:33,703
You keep on doing the laundry,
cleaning up...

512
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:39,083
Ilbanez will transfer you
to the cell next door.

513
00:48:39,919 --> 00:48:41,878
I'll have you made porter.

514
00:48:42,463 --> 00:48:47,091
You'll get paid, shop at the commissary,
walk anywhere you want.

515
00:48:48,928 --> 00:48:52,931
You'll be my eyes and my ears.

516
00:48:54,558 --> 00:48:55,767
And the others?

517
00:48:56,477 --> 00:48:58,102
What, my friends?

518
00:48:59,396 --> 00:49:00,772
You watch them too.

519
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:08,404
Are you happy? You look upset.

520
00:49:09,365 --> 00:49:10,782
I'm fine.

521
00:49:10,950 --> 00:49:11,824
So say so.

522
00:50:24,398 --> 00:50:29,277
EYES AND EARS

523
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,082
What does Cesar say?

524
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:45,835
The lawyer
will help your brother.

525
00:50:46,003 --> 00:50:48,880
He doesn't give a shit
about my brother.

526
00:50:49,048 --> 00:50:52,300
My wife left 10 messages.
He never called back.

527
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,678
Santi and Castelli, same thing.

528
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:58,014
No news. Nothing.

529
00:50:58,807 --> 00:51:00,058
Play your card.

530
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:55,738
Did you jerk off?

531
00:51:55,906 --> 00:51:56,989
JORDI THE GYPSY

532
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,283
I like porn set in castles.

533
00:51:59,451 --> 00:52:01,702
The girls are fancier, cleaner.

534
00:52:02,204 --> 00:52:03,454
How often did you come?

535
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:07,208
- When?
- Fuck that!

536
00:52:07,376 --> 00:52:09,877
Who cares when? Give me that.

537
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,296
Remember with the driver?

538
00:52:12,506 --> 00:52:14,966
She has the stick shift in her pussy.

539
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:17,969
He fucks her from behind,
slaps her ass.

540
00:52:19,346 --> 00:52:21,931
And when she blows
the blonde's husband!

541
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:24,809
Then she walks in with her big dog.

542
00:52:29,314 --> 00:52:31,149
I'll give you the rest tomorrow.

543
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:34,193
You make a lot dealing?

544
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:38,489
Not much.
Enough to shop and buy my own dope.

545
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:40,158
To shop...

546
00:52:43,203 --> 00:52:45,163
You want to work together?

547
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:50,209
I don't understand your game.

548
00:52:50,377 --> 00:52:53,004
- No game.
- You work with the Corsicans.

549
00:52:53,338 --> 00:52:54,839
I work for myself.

550
00:52:55,132 --> 00:52:58,968
You don't know everyone in C.
You don't sell to everyone.

551
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,606
What will you do after?

552
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,696
When you get out, what'll you do?

553
00:53:19,656 --> 00:53:21,073
I don't know. You?

554
00:53:22,701 --> 00:53:25,077
Same thing as in here, only bigger.

555
00:53:25,370 --> 00:53:26,245
Hash?

556
00:53:27,414 --> 00:53:28,706
Yeah, hash.

557
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,543
I'll move big loads.

558
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:34,670
Marbella-Paris, 3 cars.

559
00:53:35,005 --> 00:53:36,672
600 kilos each trip.

560
00:53:39,968 --> 00:53:41,385
Don't believe me?

561
00:53:42,971 --> 00:53:45,890
I'm just trying to picture 600 kilos.

562
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:51,729
It's like this.

563
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:55,399
You can't see anything behind it.

564
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,651
I got it.

565
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,048
They died for no reason!

566
00:55:02,134 --> 00:55:04,635
It's you who killed them!

567
00:55:37,336 --> 00:55:38,502
Still need me?

568
00:55:42,007 --> 00:55:43,632
You know about my business?

569
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,010
- You said to butt out.
- Come on...

570
00:55:46,345 --> 00:55:50,514
I don't know. Stuff with Italians.
Casinos in the south.

571
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:53,851
What is it?

572
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:59,106
How much longer are you in for?

573
00:55:59,649 --> 00:56:01,567
3 years. Minus good behavior.

574
00:56:01,735 --> 00:56:02,902
You've done half.

575
00:56:05,197 --> 00:56:06,947
You can get leave days.

576
00:56:07,616 --> 00:56:10,242
- Did you apply?
- The lawyer does that.

577
00:56:10,452 --> 00:56:11,869
Did he apply for it?

578
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:13,746
Why are you asking?

579
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:22,671
Fill out a parole application.
I'll have it treated in priority.

580
00:56:23,215 --> 00:56:25,549
In the meantime you can go on leave.

581
00:56:26,718 --> 00:56:28,636
You go out for me, you come back,

582
00:56:28,804 --> 00:56:30,888
and you get paid.
What do you say?

583
00:56:32,057 --> 00:56:33,182
What's the risk?

584
00:56:33,350 --> 00:56:36,477
There is no risk.
Staying here is the only risk.

585
00:56:50,575 --> 00:56:53,369
By the time the judge gets it,
studies it,

586
00:56:53,578 --> 00:56:55,663
requests additional information,

587
00:56:56,039 --> 00:56:59,375
you won't have an answer
for 5 or 6 months.

588
00:56:59,584 --> 00:57:02,420
I said an answer,
not necessarily a good one.

589
00:57:05,424 --> 00:57:07,299
Got a card with your number?

590
00:57:07,509 --> 00:57:08,634
Give it here.

591
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,102
A lawyer named Sampiero will call you.

592
00:57:18,645 --> 00:57:20,771
Give him whatever he asks for.

593
00:57:20,939 --> 00:57:22,440
Do everything he says.

594
00:57:22,774 --> 00:57:25,067
File the case once he prepares it.

595
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:26,527
He'll pay you.

596
00:57:27,404 --> 00:57:28,821
And for the judge?

597
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:31,615
Don't worry. He'll explain.

598
00:57:40,292 --> 00:57:41,625
Who's he?

599
00:57:41,751 --> 00:57:43,836
Who are these guys? These thugs?

600
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,130
You didn't say it was like this.

601
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:49,133
You know what may happen to me?
Disbarment!

602
00:57:49,468 --> 00:57:51,093
I don't need that.

603
00:57:51,261 --> 00:57:51,927
Too late.

604
00:57:52,304 --> 00:57:54,138
You're in.

605
00:57:56,183 --> 00:57:58,642
For now on, you're a model prisoner.

606
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:04,398
You're a porter.
Be the best in the prison.

607
00:58:04,858 --> 00:58:09,528
Study for your tests.
As for the phone, let Antarro keep it.

608
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:10,946
He'll suspect something.

609
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:13,866
I'll say you pissed me off.
He'll believe it.

610
00:58:23,627 --> 00:58:24,919
Salam.

611
00:58:25,712 --> 00:58:27,630
It was great getting your letter.

612
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:29,590
First, I hear from you.

613
00:58:29,758 --> 00:58:33,010
Second I see
you've made a lot of fucking progress.

614
00:58:33,136 --> 00:58:35,262
You write like a pro
and I'm glad.

615
00:58:35,764 --> 00:58:37,431
At least I served a purpose.

616
00:58:38,058 --> 00:58:39,642
I can tell you now...

617
00:58:39,809 --> 00:58:41,393
it was no piece of cake.

618
00:58:41,937 --> 00:58:43,062
As for what you asked,

619
00:58:43,563 --> 00:58:44,980
I'll try.

620
00:58:45,565 --> 00:58:47,066
I'll send in the request

621
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:48,526
and come visit.

622
00:58:49,236 --> 00:58:50,736
Life here isn't great.

623
00:58:52,197 --> 00:58:55,783
I'll spare you the "It's better in there"
but honestly,

624
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,284
it's tough.

625
00:58:57,452 --> 00:59:01,372
Djamila works part-time
and with the kid it's a pain.

626
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:06,126
As for me, Imam Moussab's center
found me a job.

627
00:59:06,836 --> 00:59:08,462
In telemarketing.

628
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:11,382
It pays like shit,
but I shut up and do the work.

629
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,218
Keep your chin up!
Your brother, Ryad.

630
00:59:16,596 --> 00:59:18,222
Girls, Martine.
Guys, Jean-Pierre.

631
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:19,807
A question.

632
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:22,768
- What's your name?
- Ryad Mnaili.

633
00:59:23,186 --> 00:59:24,228
Jean-Pierre, here.

634
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:27,189
You're allowed 2 mistakes.

635
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:30,234
Careful, put your hand under his head.

636
00:59:34,906 --> 00:59:37,241
Issam... meet Malik.

637
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:38,659
Your godfather.

638
00:59:50,505 --> 00:59:54,008
It's a car repair shop.
The owner agreed to hire you.

639
00:59:54,134 --> 00:59:56,260
He'll meet you
on your leave day.

640
00:59:57,554 --> 01:00:00,180
He's the guy
who fixes the Imam's cars.

641
01:00:00,765 --> 01:00:02,808
He's hired other guys from center.

642
01:00:05,061 --> 01:00:07,146
Know what you're doing for them?

643
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:09,565
You don't mind?

644
01:00:11,109 --> 01:00:12,610
I get out, get paid.

645
01:00:12,861 --> 01:00:15,529
If it's too risky for you now,
just say so.

646
01:00:15,697 --> 01:00:20,034
Risky? Are you crazy?
I'm being rehabilitated.

647
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:21,785
Aren't we rehabilitating?

648
01:00:25,832 --> 01:00:29,752
Just outside Paris,
they spot the radar, slow down.

649
01:00:29,919 --> 01:00:31,170
All of a sudden,

650
01:00:31,379 --> 01:00:33,005
the car breaks down.

651
01:00:33,423 --> 01:00:36,967
It glides along a little.
Where does it stop?

652
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:39,386
Next to a gas station!

653
01:00:39,763 --> 01:00:42,181
The guys get out, start pushing.

654
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:43,974
Guess who comes to help?

655
01:00:44,476 --> 01:00:45,684
Go on, take a guess.

656
01:00:45,852 --> 01:00:47,144
- Who?
- Guess!

657
01:00:47,270 --> 01:00:48,270
I have no idea.

658
01:00:48,438 --> 01:00:50,397
Customs, buddy! Customs!

659
01:00:52,651 --> 01:00:55,110
100 kilos. They confiscated 100 kilos.

660
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,226
So what's the point?

661
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:28,769
You're going out.

662
01:01:28,978 --> 01:01:30,396
You know what I want.

663
01:01:30,563 --> 01:01:34,024
We're in business.
Don't you smoke my hash every day?

664
01:01:34,526 --> 01:01:38,529
So I go in the hole for your swag?
Just for a few joints?

665
01:01:39,322 --> 01:01:40,197
God damn it!

666
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:41,865
Back in your cell.

667
01:01:42,033 --> 01:01:43,492
- My dessert, sir!
- Inside!

668
01:01:48,373 --> 01:01:50,874
What does the prosecution say?

669
01:01:51,835 --> 01:01:54,420
In light of the case, I'm not opposed

670
01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:57,381
to granting leave days
to Mr. El Djebena.

671
01:01:58,091 --> 01:02:00,467
But he can't stay out over 12 hours

672
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:03,679
and must sign in
at a local precinct.

673
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:07,433
Thank you, sir.
Anything else to add?

674
01:02:11,229 --> 01:02:12,688
Show in the detainee.

675
01:02:14,983 --> 01:02:16,316
Hello, Mr El Djebena.

676
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:19,695
I will grant you a leave day.

677
01:02:19,863 --> 01:02:23,073
You leave at 7 a.m.
and must be back at 7 p.m.

678
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,974
That's fucking disgusting.

679
01:02:49,726 --> 01:02:50,934
Do something.

680
01:03:25,887 --> 01:03:26,845
The door.

681
01:03:28,723 --> 01:03:30,766
- Have a good day.
- Good day, sir.

682
01:04:20,358 --> 01:04:22,109
Roll up the window.

683
01:04:32,996 --> 01:04:35,080
Your phone. That's my number.

684
01:04:36,207 --> 01:04:37,499
So you can reach me.

685
01:04:39,335 --> 01:04:41,628
Can you stop by and meet Djamila?

686
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:44,131
She's all alone.

687
01:04:44,674 --> 01:04:46,592
Got a TV in your cell now?

688
01:04:59,689 --> 01:05:00,480
For the day?

689
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:02,357
Until 7.

690
01:05:46,778 --> 01:05:48,153
How's Cesar?

691
01:05:49,072 --> 01:05:50,280
He was okay yesterday.

692
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:54,201
You'll drop this off somewhere for us.

693
01:05:55,161 --> 01:05:57,287
- And then?
- Then you come back.

694
01:05:58,289 --> 01:05:59,748
Cesar said you ask no questions.

695
01:06:00,458 --> 01:06:02,042
Cesar said I'd be paid.

696
01:06:05,296 --> 01:06:07,714
For afterwards. Okay?

697
01:06:09,842 --> 01:06:11,760
What are we going to do there?

698
01:06:12,512 --> 01:06:14,012
Wait till he comes back.

699
01:06:14,305 --> 01:06:15,931
And if something goes wrong?

700
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:20,227
Who cares?

701
01:06:34,742 --> 01:06:36,493
Middle of nowhere.

702
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:40,205
There, on the right.

703
01:06:40,373 --> 01:06:41,790
Here, here. On the right.

704
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,375
Pull over.

705
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:51,216
There's a car in front.

706
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:15,198
He's Arab!

707
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:17,034
The courier.

708
01:07:17,243 --> 01:07:18,368
Should I let him in?

709
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:21,204
What the hell?

710
01:07:40,558 --> 01:07:41,808
Who are you?

711
01:07:42,143 --> 01:07:43,560
Malik El Djebena.

712
01:07:43,728 --> 01:07:44,978
Who sent you?

713
01:07:45,188 --> 01:07:46,104
Luciani.

714
01:07:47,023 --> 01:07:48,774
Luciani's in the joint!

715
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:50,067
Who the hell are you?

716
01:07:50,735 --> 01:07:52,110
I do time with him.

717
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,946
Are you in jail or out?

718
01:07:55,323 --> 01:07:56,948
I'm on leave for the day.

719
01:07:57,158 --> 01:07:59,242
You work for those scumbags?

720
01:07:59,619 --> 01:08:01,995
I work for no one.
I work for myself.

721
01:08:02,163 --> 01:08:04,039
They say deliver,
I deliver.

722
01:08:06,459 --> 01:08:07,709
Is it all there?

723
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:08,960
Yeah.

724
01:08:11,005 --> 01:08:12,464
Can I go now?

725
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:14,091
Forgetting something?

726
01:08:14,509 --> 01:08:16,218
Don't you know about the swap?

727
01:08:30,233 --> 01:08:31,608
Let's get going.

728
01:08:49,293 --> 01:08:50,460
Shut up.

729
01:08:54,966 --> 01:08:57,092
Call Cesar. . .

730
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,596
You have to call Cesar.

731
01:09:20,491 --> 01:09:21,491
It's me.

732
01:09:21,784 --> 01:09:23,785
I've got a problem.

733
01:09:24,162 --> 01:09:26,079
I'm not alone.
I'm with Santi.

734
01:09:58,613 --> 01:10:01,072
Rue de Madrid. They're waiting.

735
01:10:01,616 --> 01:10:04,492
We have to go.
Can you make it back alone?

736
01:10:05,203 --> 01:10:07,412
- Message for Cesar?
- I'll call him.

737
01:10:07,663 --> 01:10:09,748
Make sure you get back on time.

738
01:10:10,249 --> 01:10:12,292
We may be working together again.

739
01:10:15,588 --> 01:10:17,422
- What is it?
- You know...

740
01:12:17,835 --> 01:12:18,710
God damn!

741
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:22,005
- How much is there?
- 25 kilos.

742
01:12:27,011 --> 01:12:28,094
There's this too.

743
01:12:31,307 --> 01:12:32,307
5000.

744
01:12:34,685 --> 01:12:37,771
5000 euros... and 25 kilos of hash?

745
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:40,148
All in one day?

746
01:12:40,941 --> 01:12:43,693
We get guys to stock and sell.
We supply.

747
01:12:44,695 --> 01:12:47,322
We use convoys and buy at the source.

748
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,074
The gypsy has contacts.

749
01:12:49,408 --> 01:12:52,744
We need 3 big cars.
Paris-Marbella, in one night.

750
01:12:53,913 --> 01:12:55,497
The first car scouts.

751
01:12:55,664 --> 01:12:57,707
The second car carries the load.

752
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,834
Further back, an escort vehicle.

753
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,338
The cars stay in touch
all night long.

754
01:13:04,006 --> 01:13:05,882
Each car is one exit apart.

755
01:13:06,801 --> 01:13:09,177
Hold on,
I've never done this before.

756
01:13:09,345 --> 01:13:10,720
So what's the problem?

757
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:12,180
Neither have I.

758
01:13:13,891 --> 01:13:16,017
You run the projects, me the prison.

759
01:13:16,310 --> 01:13:18,978
I'll cut a deal with inmates on leave.

760
01:13:19,897 --> 01:13:23,108
Jordi knows a trucker
who delivers to the prison.

761
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:27,946
We put half the money back in
and split the rest in 3.

762
01:13:28,656 --> 01:13:29,697
Sounds good.

763
01:13:30,282 --> 01:13:33,910
Wire some to my commissary account.
For the rest we'll see.

764
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,955
- What time is it?
- 6:45.

765
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:40,375
Let me tell you something.

766
01:13:40,918 --> 01:13:42,335
Let me tell you.

767
01:13:43,170 --> 01:13:45,088
Come out whenever you want!

768
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:50,927
- Watch out.
- You too.

769
01:13:54,432 --> 01:13:56,391
El Djebena, Malik.
35-114T.

770
01:14:00,229 --> 01:14:02,689
- Was it for training?
- Auto repair.

771
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:05,608
- You like car repair?
- Yeah, whatever.

772
01:14:06,652 --> 01:14:08,111
I'm rehabilitating.

773
01:14:08,988 --> 01:14:10,071
Bend over.

774
01:14:10,990 --> 01:14:11,948
Cough.

775
01:14:14,243 --> 01:14:16,327
Sampiero said I might do it again.

776
01:14:16,829 --> 01:14:18,204
What do you think?

777
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:19,581
It's cool.

778
01:14:19,915 --> 01:14:21,040
You see?

779
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:24,752
Who did you see besides Sampiero?

780
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:27,380
My friend.
The one who got me the job.

781
01:14:28,466 --> 01:14:29,966
Is there a problem?

782
01:14:32,470 --> 01:14:35,638
I want it clear.
Your prison leave belongs to me.

783
01:14:35,848 --> 01:14:37,056
Period.

784
01:14:37,558 --> 01:14:39,517
Here, I keep on being your "Arab"?

785
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:41,478
Yes, you do the shit-work.

786
01:14:53,073 --> 01:14:58,077
Names in the upper right-hand corner
and fold it backwards.

787
01:14:58,245 --> 01:15:00,747
You have one hour for the French.

788
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:02,582
We'll do Economics last.

789
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:06,461
- We write on the pages?
- Yes, directly on the exam.

790
01:15:14,345 --> 01:15:16,763
ECONOMICS

791
01:15:42,373 --> 01:15:43,456
Buddy!

792
01:15:45,459 --> 01:15:47,168
I heard from your mother.

793
01:16:11,735 --> 01:16:13,861
Gentlemen, take your seats.

794
01:16:14,029 --> 01:16:16,155
I'll hand out the Economics exam.

795
01:16:20,411 --> 01:16:21,244
El Djebena.

796
01:16:21,412 --> 01:16:22,412
Morning, sir.

797
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:28,251
- Batteries?
- The big ones.

798
01:16:46,895 --> 01:16:48,271
- Malik.
- Sophie.

799
01:17:21,138 --> 01:17:23,848
Am I crazy
or do they keep multiplying?

800
01:17:25,267 --> 01:17:27,477
Soon they'll bring out the rugs.

801
01:17:29,021 --> 01:17:31,022
Before, we ruled the yard.

802
01:17:32,441 --> 01:17:33,691
Good thing they're dumb.

803
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:40,114
If they stopped thinking
with their balls,

804
01:17:40,616 --> 01:17:42,659
they'd have evolved more.

805
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:48,164
You should walk over there
and check things out.

806
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,249
I don't think so.

807
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:53,378
What do you mean?

808
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:58,716
You want me to go get beat up?

809
01:17:58,884 --> 01:18:00,677
Why would they beat you up?

810
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:03,137
Are you crazy?
For them I'm Corsican.

811
01:18:04,098 --> 01:18:08,059
They don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground!

812
01:18:19,822 --> 01:18:21,531
Send a few hacks there.

813
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:25,201
To mess with them.
They'll eat out of your hand.

814
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,538
Thatta boy.

815
01:18:30,999 --> 01:18:34,127
Just another Arab
thinking with his balls.

816
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,958
YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE

817
01:19:27,306 --> 01:19:29,849
Let me introduce you to some friends.

818
01:19:30,058 --> 01:19:31,142
Marbella, man!

819
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:32,977
This is Khalid!

820
01:19:33,145 --> 01:19:33,936
Yo, bro!

821
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:38,191
This is Mishka!

822
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:39,901
This is Damien.

823
01:19:40,068 --> 01:19:42,361
And here's Olivier.
Say hi to Malik.

824
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:44,071
What's your name?

825
01:19:44,198 --> 01:19:45,656
My name is Fernanda!

826
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:46,949
And I like cock!

827
01:19:53,165 --> 01:19:53,915
Marbella!

828
01:19:59,588 --> 01:20:01,339
Over in cellblock B...

829
01:20:01,924 --> 01:20:06,135
What do the Muslims do?
Smuggle in stuff? Drugs?

830
01:20:06,345 --> 01:20:07,553
They toe the line.

831
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,681
Really? You got nothing on them?

832
01:20:13,352 --> 01:20:16,103
Don't you think it might be good

833
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,232
to send in a couple high-strung guys?

834
01:20:19,775 --> 01:20:21,359
To mess with them a bit.

835
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:23,444
Why mess with them?

836
01:20:23,946 --> 01:20:25,196
Why?

837
01:20:26,365 --> 01:20:30,368
To show who's boss, whose hand to kiss,
whose back to rub.

838
01:20:30,661 --> 01:20:32,245
Isn't it obvious?

839
01:20:33,831 --> 01:20:36,249
Before there were 20 of you.
Now 5.

840
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:38,251
See the difference, or not?

841
01:20:41,630 --> 01:20:43,214
What kind of difference?

842
01:20:45,676 --> 01:20:47,885
I can't do for 5 what I did for 20.

843
01:20:49,847 --> 01:20:52,014
So why the hell are you here?

844
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:54,892
Want a transfer? I'll tell Marcaggi.

845
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:55,852
I'll be okay.

846
01:20:56,144 --> 01:20:57,019
You'll what?

847
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:58,938
I'll manage. I'll see what...

848
01:20:59,106 --> 01:21:00,439
You'll manage?

849
01:21:00,899 --> 01:21:02,108
Use your head.

850
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:03,901
Tomorrow tell me

851
01:21:04,069 --> 01:21:06,529
what you can do for me.

852
01:21:26,133 --> 01:21:27,675
We have a problem, brother.

853
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:45,109
File a complaint.
What can I say?

854
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:47,653
Maybe Luciani can do something.

855
01:21:48,739 --> 01:21:49,655
I don't get it.

856
01:21:50,157 --> 01:21:54,160
First I'm their lapdog
and now I should kiss their asses?

857
01:21:54,328 --> 01:21:57,163
Don't do it for me,
do it for the brothers.

858
01:21:57,789 --> 01:22:02,126
So I should make up
for being their slave by being yours?

859
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:04,378
If you want a favor, learn to ask.

860
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:08,007
What do you want?

861
01:22:08,884 --> 01:22:10,509
What can I get out of it?

862
01:22:10,886 --> 01:22:11,677
Respect.

863
01:22:11,929 --> 01:22:13,346
Do I look Corsican?

864
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,514
Are you getting a big head?

865
01:22:16,934 --> 01:22:18,517
I'll see what I can do.

866
01:22:38,538 --> 01:22:39,580
Luciani.

867
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,758
You meet here now?

868
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:55,346
It's heated. It's cozy.
Nice ocean view.

869
01:22:55,597 --> 01:22:56,347
Sit down.

870
01:22:56,515 --> 01:22:57,598
I'm fine here.

871
01:22:58,809 --> 01:23:00,226
What do you want?

872
01:23:00,978 --> 01:23:02,728
I have a problem in Marseille.

873
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,400
One of yours.
Brahim Lattrache.

874
01:23:08,318 --> 01:23:10,528
I want a message delivered to him.

875
01:23:11,321 --> 01:23:14,657
Tell him Luciani
will talk one on one, okay?

876
01:23:16,743 --> 01:23:17,410
I'll see.

877
01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:20,371
What about the hacks?

878
01:23:21,206 --> 01:23:22,331
I'll see.

879
01:23:24,251 --> 01:23:26,252
Brahim Lattrache in Marseille.

880
01:23:33,635 --> 01:23:34,969
See the guy in red?

881
01:23:36,096 --> 01:23:38,097
He'll turn around and start over.

882
01:23:42,936 --> 01:23:44,186
Those two, running...

883
01:23:44,980 --> 01:23:46,814
See the small one with the beanie?

884
01:23:47,441 --> 01:23:49,066
He'll do push-ups.

885
01:23:54,406 --> 01:23:55,781
Check out the game.

886
01:23:56,116 --> 01:23:57,783
Watch the hoop.

887
01:24:02,164 --> 01:24:03,497
Missed. Up yours!

888
01:24:05,042 --> 01:24:05,624
Him.

889
01:24:13,675 --> 01:24:15,676
For me you don't see anything?

890
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:21,849
Yes... snow.

891
01:24:40,952 --> 01:24:43,621
Okay! I'll pull over!

892
01:24:45,916 --> 01:24:47,166
Go fuck yourself...

893
01:24:48,919 --> 01:24:50,169
Faster, faster!

894
01:24:55,050 --> 01:24:55,758
Okay!

895
01:25:00,138 --> 01:25:03,015
They let one car pass
then ambushed Riyad.

896
01:25:03,266 --> 01:25:05,101
Took him along with the hash.

897
01:25:05,852 --> 01:25:07,228
Now they want money.

898
01:25:08,188 --> 01:25:09,647
Who are these guys?

899
01:25:09,856 --> 01:25:11,023
What do you know?

900
01:25:11,191 --> 01:25:15,569
Nothing. Just their boss.
Named Latif, the Egyptian.

901
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:17,530
From the south side.

902
01:25:17,781 --> 01:25:20,491
They use the same route,
know the lowdown.

903
01:25:23,578 --> 01:25:25,037
What about the dough?

904
01:25:27,874 --> 01:25:29,875
Give them everything they want.

905
01:25:31,878 --> 01:25:32,503
Sir!

906
01:25:32,796 --> 01:25:34,130
Hear from your friend?

907
01:25:34,297 --> 01:25:37,174
No news. What can I do?
It's been 3 days...

908
01:25:37,342 --> 01:25:38,884
Calm down!

909
01:25:39,136 --> 01:25:41,178
It's crowded here and we got hash.

910
01:25:41,346 --> 01:25:42,972
If someone knows the Egyptian,

911
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:45,391
we'll hear about it, don't worry.

912
01:25:45,559 --> 01:25:47,560
When we find him, it'll hurt!

913
01:25:49,604 --> 01:25:51,897
- And the Muslims?
- Coming along.

914
01:25:52,399 --> 01:25:55,109
Go see them... and take care of it.

915
01:26:12,836 --> 01:26:14,253
I have a favor to ask.

916
01:26:14,504 --> 01:26:15,504
What is it?

917
01:26:15,630 --> 01:26:17,423
I need info on someone.

918
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:20,134
- Who?
- A black. Latif the Egyptian.

919
01:26:20,302 --> 01:26:21,302
Latif?

920
01:26:22,053 --> 01:26:23,429
What can I do?

921
01:26:23,597 --> 01:26:25,931
Tell me who he knows in here.

922
01:26:26,433 --> 01:26:27,433
His brother-in-law.

923
01:26:36,067 --> 01:26:37,443
What was the trade-off?

924
01:26:37,611 --> 01:26:39,278
Nothing. That's my business.

925
01:26:39,446 --> 01:26:40,112
See him?

926
01:26:42,324 --> 01:26:43,574
The one over there.

927
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:45,451
The blue beanie.

928
01:26:47,579 --> 01:26:48,954
And the other two...

929
01:26:49,247 --> 01:26:50,623
are they his guys?

930
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:51,749
Looks like it.

931
01:26:51,958 --> 01:26:53,459
Are the Muslims helping?

932
01:26:53,627 --> 01:26:55,461
They're giving us two guys.

933
01:26:56,087 --> 01:26:59,465
No problem.
If it's planned well, it'll be fine.

934
01:27:29,913 --> 01:27:31,163
Shut your mouth!

935
01:27:39,881 --> 01:27:40,839
Sir!

936
01:27:41,925 --> 01:27:44,510
It's his ankle.
He has to see a doctor.

937
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:12,663
The lights!

938
01:28:28,138 --> 01:28:29,388
Mohammed Gazil?

939
01:28:29,556 --> 01:28:30,681
You know the Egyptian?

940
01:28:31,266 --> 01:28:33,434
- You know him?
- Yes.

941
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:34,518
Sit down.

942
01:28:39,524 --> 01:28:41,150
Is Ouassila Gazil your mother?

943
01:28:41,359 --> 01:28:43,736
It's her address on the visitor list?

944
01:28:44,237 --> 01:28:45,154
Look.

945
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:49,366
Want to see her alive?

946
01:28:50,118 --> 01:28:53,787
Tell Latif
I want my friend and my stuff back.

947
01:28:55,874 --> 01:28:56,707
Call.

948
01:29:07,093 --> 01:29:08,260
Where were you?

949
01:29:08,428 --> 01:29:09,887
At the registry office.

950
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:12,014
Did it go well?

951
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:14,600
- Have you eaten?
- I need to see a guy.

952
01:29:14,768 --> 01:29:17,603
He'll wait.
Come and have a coffee.

953
01:29:24,527 --> 01:29:25,694
Help yourself.

954
01:29:34,162 --> 01:29:36,288
I wanted to talk about something.

955
01:29:36,456 --> 01:29:39,792
I saw you with that tall guy,
the Gypsy, in the yard.

956
01:29:41,127 --> 01:29:43,921
What's your thing? Hashish? Pills?

957
01:29:45,340 --> 01:29:46,256
Hash.

958
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,133
A lot?

959
01:29:48,593 --> 01:29:49,927
You want your share?

960
01:29:50,136 --> 01:29:53,430
It's your business. It concerns you.

961
01:29:54,140 --> 01:29:56,850
- How do you get it in?
- Visiting rooms, kitchens.

962
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,143
So you got guards.

963
01:29:59,187 --> 01:30:01,313
A delivery guy.
Frozen goods.

964
01:30:01,981 --> 01:30:03,482
So that's how it works.

965
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:04,817
For the time being.

966
01:30:10,782 --> 01:30:12,825
What happens if you get nailed?

967
01:30:16,413 --> 01:30:17,496
It's the hole.

968
01:30:18,415 --> 01:30:20,082
And then no more leave.

969
01:30:23,002 --> 01:30:25,796
What did I tell you last time?

970
01:30:26,172 --> 01:30:29,425
I said to watch your step.
Don't risk your leave.

971
01:30:29,801 --> 01:30:32,219
What do you do?
You beat up guys.

972
01:30:32,554 --> 01:30:34,847
You make the law.
What's your game?

973
01:30:35,765 --> 01:30:38,600
You're of use if you go on leave,
Djebena.

974
01:30:38,768 --> 01:30:41,478
If you don't,
then what good are you?

975
01:30:42,480 --> 01:30:43,522
Get lost.

976
01:30:49,988 --> 01:30:50,904
Get lost!

977
01:31:12,302 --> 01:31:13,552
Bastard!

978
01:31:19,225 --> 01:31:21,018
I'm gonna kill you...

979
01:31:32,238 --> 01:31:33,947
No longer scared of me?

980
01:31:39,162 --> 01:31:41,580
If you can walk around this place,

981
01:31:41,748 --> 01:31:43,916
it's because I had you made porter.

982
01:31:44,959 --> 01:31:46,668
If you eat...

983
01:31:47,504 --> 01:31:51,048
it's thanks to me.
If you dream, think, live...

984
01:31:51,257 --> 01:31:52,549
it's thanks to me.

985
01:31:54,302 --> 01:31:57,346
You say you got no guards.
Dumb shit!

986
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:01,391
The name Luciani
is branded on your face!

987
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,436
You live off me, Djebena!

988
01:32:07,774 --> 01:32:09,858
People look at you and see me.

989
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:12,861
Otherwise what would they see?
Can you tell me?

990
01:33:43,494 --> 01:33:44,578
Are you here?

991
01:34:33,878 --> 01:34:34,795
Come here.

992
01:34:37,048 --> 01:34:39,091
Isn't this enough?

993
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:40,759
Come here, I said.

994
01:34:41,094 --> 01:34:43,428
I have something funny to tell you.

995
01:34:50,269 --> 01:34:51,812
You're going to Marseille.

996
01:34:54,482 --> 01:34:57,275
On your next leave,
you go to Marseille.

997
01:34:58,569 --> 01:35:00,821
BrÃ©court-Marseille in one day?

998
01:35:02,448 --> 01:35:05,951
There's a flight at 9 a.m.
Return at 3.

999
01:35:06,911 --> 01:35:09,454
There, you'll meet Brahim Lattrache.

1000
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,624
Am I carrying something?

1001
01:35:14,794 --> 01:35:16,670
You talk, you listen.

1002
01:35:16,921 --> 01:35:20,799
See what it'll cost
to cut off ties with the Italians.

1003
01:35:24,053 --> 01:35:26,972
Tell him I'm willing to negotiate

1004
01:35:27,140 --> 01:35:29,558
without Jacky Marciaggi and the others.

1005
01:35:31,978 --> 01:35:34,938
As for your pay and your trip,

1006
01:35:35,106 --> 01:35:37,065
Sampiero will contact your pal outside.

1007
01:35:41,946 --> 01:35:43,655
Ever taken a plane?

1008
01:36:30,036 --> 01:36:32,037
Have a nice day, Truette.

1009
01:36:32,205 --> 01:36:33,580
Have a nice day, El Djebena.

1010
01:36:33,831 --> 01:36:34,956
Good day, sir.

1011
01:36:35,124 --> 01:36:36,541
Open up, please.

1012
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:10,242
When you pick me up,
be on time!

1013
01:37:10,409 --> 01:37:12,244
Careful! Don't talk like that!

1014
01:37:12,411 --> 01:37:15,080
How should I talk?
I take all the risks!

1015
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:16,998
Yeah, okay, I understand.

1016
01:37:18,209 --> 01:37:19,876
This car is bullshit!

1017
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:22,087
Fucking patrol bait!

1018
01:37:23,714 --> 01:37:25,924
- You're getting dumb.
- Enough already.

1019
01:37:26,092 --> 01:37:27,175
Enough what?

1020
01:37:27,844 --> 01:37:31,930
Why are you bossing me around?
If you want out, say so.

1021
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,308
Save it for Latif's trunk.

1022
01:38:05,256 --> 01:38:07,048
Get Latif out of your head.

1023
01:38:08,426 --> 01:38:11,052
I'll find him and waste his ass.

1024
01:38:11,929 --> 01:38:13,096
You'll waste no one.

1025
01:38:13,639 --> 01:38:15,765
Wake up. Business has stalled.

1026
01:38:15,933 --> 01:38:19,269
It's not personal.
That fucker blocked everything.

1027
01:38:20,938 --> 01:38:23,523
We got the hash back
but can't move it.

1028
01:38:25,151 --> 01:38:27,861
They even fuck with us
in our projects.

1029
01:38:28,779 --> 01:38:30,238
I swear, I'll waste him.

1030
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:32,908
Fuck it...

1031
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:37,120
You look like a lawyer.

1032
01:38:48,966 --> 01:38:52,177
You're boarding at 9:55,
gate 33, terminal 2.

1033
01:38:52,887 --> 01:38:53,762
Enjoy your flight.

1034
01:39:11,530 --> 01:39:12,530
Step forward.

1035
01:39:13,991 --> 01:39:15,116
Arms out.

1036
01:40:59,472 --> 01:41:00,388
Your hands!

1037
01:41:00,514 --> 01:41:01,264
What for?

1038
01:41:01,432 --> 01:41:02,474
Your hands.

1039
01:41:53,359 --> 01:41:54,109
Move.

1040
01:42:09,792 --> 01:42:11,334
Is this necessary?

1041
01:42:12,711 --> 01:42:14,045
Doesn't bother me.

1042
01:42:14,672 --> 01:42:16,172
What does Luciani want?

1043
01:42:17,091 --> 01:42:20,135
To know your price
for pulling out with the Italians.

1044
01:42:21,345 --> 01:42:25,348
He'll guarantee your take
on the slot machines.

1045
01:42:26,517 --> 01:42:28,351
What's he guaranteeing with?

1046
01:42:28,519 --> 01:42:30,061
His commissary card?

1047
01:42:31,313 --> 01:42:32,355
With the Council.

1048
01:42:32,523 --> 01:42:34,357
His offer's backed by Marcaggi

1049
01:42:34,525 --> 01:42:36,484
and the Corsican Council.

1050
01:42:40,906 --> 01:42:42,657
How long have you known him?

1051
01:42:43,909 --> 01:42:45,160
Since prison.

1052
01:42:47,705 --> 01:42:49,372
Worked for him ever since?

1053
01:42:51,417 --> 01:42:53,126
It just happened...

1054
01:42:53,294 --> 01:42:54,502
Got there, started working.

1055
01:42:57,506 --> 01:42:58,548
Does he protect you?

1056
01:42:58,924 --> 01:43:00,592
I work. No protection.

1057
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:03,678
- You're their Arab. They protect you.
- No, I work.

1058
01:43:04,555 --> 01:43:05,680
What's the price?

1059
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:08,600
You rat?

1060
01:43:09,101 --> 01:43:10,351
Run errands?

1061
01:43:11,896 --> 01:43:13,521
- Suck them?
- What the hell?

1062
01:43:17,651 --> 01:43:20,195
Why does an Arab work for Corsicans?

1063
01:43:20,404 --> 01:43:21,529
You belly-dance?

1064
01:43:22,364 --> 01:43:23,573
You their waitress?

1065
01:43:24,617 --> 01:43:26,951
I had a friend there.
Never got out.

1066
01:43:28,704 --> 01:43:29,954
Named Reyeb.

1067
01:43:30,789 --> 01:43:35,168
Sound familiar?

1068
01:43:37,421 --> 01:43:39,214
Did Luciani have him wasted?

1069
01:43:39,965 --> 01:43:43,843
What do you know?

1070
01:43:54,605 --> 01:43:55,897
Animals coming!

1071
01:43:56,065 --> 01:43:56,898
Watch out!

1072
01:44:09,745 --> 01:44:12,080
Over there! Two more!

1073
01:44:13,666 --> 01:44:14,707
Kill it!

1074
01:44:30,724 --> 01:44:32,100
What's your thing?

1075
01:44:32,726 --> 01:44:33,977
How do you do it?

1076
01:44:34,603 --> 01:44:36,646
What are you?

1077
01:44:37,106 --> 01:44:38,606
A prophet or what?

1078
01:44:42,820 --> 01:44:44,320
I did Reyeb.

1079
01:44:48,867 --> 01:44:50,618
Fuck,
you've come a long way.

1080
01:45:19,773 --> 01:45:21,232
What's your name?

1081
01:45:21,358 --> 01:45:22,317
Malik.

1082
01:45:22,985 --> 01:45:25,653
I'll wash your shirt
and your pants too.

1083
01:45:26,113 --> 01:45:28,823
- The pants aren't dirty.
- Are you sure?

1084
01:45:29,283 --> 01:45:31,117
Then just give me your shirt.

1085
01:45:54,850 --> 01:45:56,726
Here's your shirt, my son.

1086
01:45:56,894 --> 01:46:00,688
I washed it
but the bloodstains won't go away.

1087
01:46:09,198 --> 01:46:10,490
Prophet!

1088
01:46:11,283 --> 01:46:14,494
Tell me something.
Some Muslims asked me about Luciani.

1089
01:46:14,703 --> 01:46:15,578
Was that you?

1090
01:46:18,499 --> 01:46:20,416
You talk with Muslims, Corsicans,

1091
01:46:21,001 --> 01:46:22,126
you come here...

1092
01:46:23,212 --> 01:46:24,587
Straddling everyone.

1093
01:46:25,005 --> 01:46:27,215
It's not too great on your balls.

1094
01:46:28,801 --> 01:46:30,134
Talk to Lingherri too?

1095
01:46:33,764 --> 01:46:36,099
The Italians have a Corsican snitch.

1096
01:46:36,225 --> 01:46:37,725
Does your boss know?

1097
01:46:39,019 --> 01:46:39,852
Are you sure?

1098
01:46:40,020 --> 01:46:41,020
Positive.

1099
01:46:41,397 --> 01:46:42,730
Know him well enough?

1100
01:46:47,361 --> 01:46:49,112
So tell that to Luciani.

1101
01:46:49,446 --> 01:46:51,739
I accept his offer on one condition.

1102
01:46:52,408 --> 01:46:55,743
He finds the snitch
and he cleans house.

1103
01:47:01,041 --> 01:47:02,250
I have a favor.

1104
01:47:02,876 --> 01:47:04,919
I got trouble with a guy in Paris.

1105
01:47:05,087 --> 01:47:07,588
Named Latif the Egyptian.
You know him?

1106
01:47:08,924 --> 01:47:10,007
What can I do?

1107
01:47:11,468 --> 01:47:13,469
Can you tell him
we know each other?

1108
01:47:14,471 --> 01:47:15,805
That we work together?

1109
01:47:18,642 --> 01:47:19,767
Work together...

1110
01:47:20,769 --> 01:47:22,145
What do you think?

1111
01:47:28,610 --> 01:47:30,653
Let's get sucked before you go.

1112
01:47:32,990 --> 01:47:35,408
- Can I stay on the beach?
- As you like.

1113
01:48:15,491 --> 01:48:16,449
Hurry!

1114
01:48:21,205 --> 01:48:22,455
Did it go okay?

1115
01:48:31,215 --> 01:48:33,466
You and Latif will meet and talk.

1116
01:48:34,259 --> 01:48:36,886
Seriously?
I'm gonna meet that asshole?

1117
01:48:38,305 --> 01:48:40,932
Lattrache will contact him.
He'll accept.

1118
01:48:41,308 --> 01:48:44,185
He's involved?
You saw him for the Corsicans.

1119
01:48:44,728 --> 01:48:46,771
He needs Luciani, we need Latif.

1120
01:48:46,939 --> 01:48:48,439
We help each other.

1121
01:48:50,150 --> 01:48:51,484
Work out a deal.

1122
01:48:51,735 --> 01:48:56,113
We go partners, pool everything.
Hide-outs, cars, suppliers.

1123
01:48:57,115 --> 01:48:59,325
We take over the market
and we rule.

1124
01:48:59,576 --> 01:49:01,744
You know what you're asking me?

1125
01:49:02,996 --> 01:49:05,915
We'll settle our scores
when the time's right.

1126
01:49:06,083 --> 01:49:07,583
Now we'll do it this way.

1127
01:49:13,674 --> 01:49:14,799
I'm sick again.

1128
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,221
I did tests. They're not good.

1129
01:49:20,764 --> 01:49:22,014
I need more chemo.

1130
01:49:28,230 --> 01:49:29,272
Will you be okay?

1131
01:49:35,070 --> 01:49:36,946
Take care, brother.

1132
01:49:42,869 --> 01:49:44,412
You're 30 minutes late.

1133
01:49:44,705 --> 01:49:45,913
You know the rules.

1134
01:49:46,081 --> 01:49:48,249
I removed car doors all day long.

1135
01:49:48,417 --> 01:49:49,709
Spread your legs.

1136
01:49:51,003 --> 01:49:54,005
I'll let it go for now.
Think about your parole.

1137
01:49:54,172 --> 01:49:55,131
Damn it!

1138
01:49:55,299 --> 01:49:56,299
Check the time!

1139
01:50:14,067 --> 01:50:18,112
I don't give a fuck
about Marcaggi's thanks.

1140
01:50:18,614 --> 01:50:21,532
All I want is for him
to move his ass

1141
01:50:21,658 --> 01:50:23,451
and settle this thing.

1142
01:50:25,287 --> 01:50:28,623
As we speak
one of our guys is sleeping

1143
01:50:28,790 --> 01:50:31,792
with the Italians.
I want to know who.

1144
01:50:32,669 --> 01:50:34,253
Does he know?

1145
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:35,254
Yes.

1146
01:50:35,422 --> 01:50:36,464
So?

1147
01:50:37,591 --> 01:50:39,091
He's dealing with it.

1148
01:50:40,427 --> 01:50:42,386
It concerns him
and him alone.

1149
01:50:42,554 --> 01:50:45,306
It was the same for Lattrache.

1150
01:50:45,766 --> 01:50:47,433
You know who he is?

1151
01:50:47,768 --> 01:50:48,851
No.

1152
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:52,855
Hold on, Cesar.

1153
01:50:53,649 --> 01:50:56,067
Jacky wants you
to stay out of this.

1154
01:50:56,234 --> 01:50:58,069
Not to the side, not far.

1155
01:50:58,236 --> 01:50:59,487
Out!

1156
01:51:01,865 --> 01:51:04,450
He says
if you need anything...

1157
01:51:04,618 --> 01:51:06,661
I'm okay.
Don't put yourself out.

1158
01:51:13,502 --> 01:51:14,835
Here's some good news.

1159
01:51:16,296 --> 01:51:18,798
You asked
about creating a hotel company.

1160
01:51:20,008 --> 01:51:23,094
I think I found someone.
A Basque in Pamplona.

1161
01:51:24,721 --> 01:51:26,931
Why do you say "good news"?

1162
01:51:27,182 --> 01:51:28,641
You told me to look.

1163
01:51:28,809 --> 01:51:31,811
We're talking
about Jacky, Sardinia, casinos,

1164
01:51:32,312 --> 01:51:33,729
you tell me to butt out

1165
01:51:33,939 --> 01:51:36,649
and all of a sudden:
"Good news".

1166
01:51:36,817 --> 01:51:38,359
It wasn't good before?

1167
01:51:38,652 --> 01:51:39,694
It was.

1168
01:51:40,404 --> 01:51:42,321
So why "Now some good news"?

1169
01:51:42,489 --> 01:51:44,156
I didn't say "now".

1170
01:51:44,741 --> 01:51:49,286
- I can tell you two good things.
- Can you? It's been ages!

1171
01:51:51,373 --> 01:51:52,456
Thanks, sir.

1172
01:52:08,640 --> 01:52:09,724
Give me the papers.

1173
01:52:18,191 --> 01:52:20,401
You get the scores?

1174
01:52:20,569 --> 01:52:21,861
Which game?

1175
01:52:30,287 --> 01:52:31,912
Why do you make the coffee?

1176
01:52:34,583 --> 01:52:36,667
Why still act like a servant?

1177
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:42,673
You go out for me,
you see Sampiero, you see Lattrache.

1178
01:52:43,091 --> 01:52:46,177
You deal with my business...
the casinos.

1179
01:52:46,344 --> 01:52:47,762
The Lingherris.

1180
01:52:49,222 --> 01:52:52,183
And when I ask for a coffee,
you hop to it.

1181
01:53:03,612 --> 01:53:05,112
Nothing to say?

1182
01:53:06,156 --> 01:53:07,615
What's the question?

1183
01:53:08,283 --> 01:53:10,451
Why I do it
or how it makes me feel?

1184
01:53:11,161 --> 01:53:12,536
I do it because you ask.

1185
01:53:13,830 --> 01:53:15,289
Want to know how I feel?

1186
01:53:15,457 --> 01:53:16,707
I couldn't care less.

1187
01:53:19,044 --> 01:53:20,461
Still need me?

1188
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:24,215
You're the one
who needs me!

1189
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,511
Can I go?

1190
01:53:38,980 --> 01:53:40,231
Can you hear me?

1191
01:53:41,233 --> 01:53:42,650
When do you see Latif?

1192
01:53:43,735 --> 01:53:46,987
Listen to me.
Give my share to Imam Moussab.

1193
01:53:47,280 --> 01:53:48,489
Give it all to him.

1194
01:53:50,784 --> 01:53:53,285
I have no fucking idea.
Try the mosque.

1195
01:53:53,453 --> 01:53:57,832
I just want the money to get to him,
on behalf of Malik El Djebena.

1196
01:53:58,583 --> 01:54:00,459
He'll know how to find me.

1197
01:54:01,002 --> 01:54:04,672
Do as I say.
Then leave me a message.

1198
01:54:34,536 --> 01:54:36,620
Move your fat ass, nigger!

1199
01:54:47,215 --> 01:54:48,799
- Better?
- I'm fine.

1200
01:55:44,898 --> 01:55:47,858
That money at the mosque...
Is it from you?

1201
01:55:48,193 --> 01:55:49,944
Is it dirty money?

1202
01:55:50,111 --> 01:55:51,987
Of course it's dirty!

1203
01:55:53,281 --> 01:55:56,909
But it's better in his hands
than in mine.

1204
01:55:57,118 --> 01:55:59,286
You think the Imam will take it?

1205
01:56:00,997 --> 01:56:02,623
That depends on you, guys.

1206
01:56:05,710 --> 01:56:09,004
I understand what you do here,
and I respect it.

1207
01:56:09,130 --> 01:56:10,714
But you're not in power.

1208
01:56:11,341 --> 01:56:13,592
The Corsicans control the guards.

1209
01:56:14,719 --> 01:56:16,136
You pray in pigsties,

1210
01:56:16,346 --> 01:56:18,430
sleep in shit-holes.
You stand up

1211
01:56:18,598 --> 01:56:19,932
and get knocked back down.

1212
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:23,310
Maybe the Imam
could use that dirty money.

1213
01:56:25,146 --> 01:56:25,938
What do you want?

1214
01:56:27,315 --> 01:56:30,776
Same as you, Hassan.
A better life for me and my friends.

1215
01:56:30,944 --> 01:56:33,320
Do I look stupid? All you want

1216
01:56:33,488 --> 01:56:35,155
is to use us, no more.

1217
01:56:35,365 --> 01:56:36,323
So?

1218
01:56:37,701 --> 01:56:39,368
As long as we're all happy.

1219
01:56:44,124 --> 01:56:44,748
Listen.

1220
01:56:44,958 --> 01:56:47,960
Go straight to the Imam again
and you're dead.

1221
01:56:48,461 --> 01:56:50,295
You talk money with me.

1222
01:56:50,630 --> 01:56:51,964
It's between us. Okay?

1223
01:56:56,928 --> 01:57:00,305
Is that why you gave the Imam money?
To meet with me?

1224
01:57:03,601 --> 01:57:04,476
Thug to thug?

1225
01:57:04,602 --> 01:57:05,310
Cut the shit!

1226
01:57:05,979 --> 01:57:07,479
Just kidding.

1227
01:57:44,142 --> 01:57:47,019
CHRISTMAS

1228
01:58:03,411 --> 01:58:06,246
Handmade.
Without gifts it's not Christmas.

1229
01:58:10,835 --> 01:58:13,670
I'm the gift.
100% handmade.

1230
01:58:13,838 --> 01:58:15,589
What a gift!

1231
01:58:16,591 --> 01:58:18,008
No care packages?

1232
01:58:18,384 --> 01:58:19,676
Help yourself.

1233
01:58:24,557 --> 01:58:26,475
Is wild boar pork?

1234
01:58:27,894 --> 01:58:29,061
Are you kidding?

1235
01:58:30,772 --> 01:58:33,649
Can we stop?
Can you and I talk sincerely?

1236
01:58:36,736 --> 01:58:37,945
Why?

1237
01:58:40,406 --> 01:58:42,783
I'm going to ask a favor of you

1238
01:58:42,951 --> 01:58:45,035
not because you work for me,

1239
01:58:46,162 --> 01:58:47,996
but because I trust you.

1240
01:58:48,164 --> 01:58:49,915
Understand the difference?

1241
01:58:52,293 --> 01:58:53,794
I'm not sure.

1242
01:59:01,094 --> 01:59:04,096
I saw Vettori. He got some info.

1243
01:59:04,305 --> 01:59:07,182
We know who's talking to the Lingherris.

1244
01:59:07,809 --> 01:59:09,101
Form a team.

1245
01:59:09,477 --> 01:59:11,270
What are your guys like?

1246
01:59:12,272 --> 01:59:14,606
- A team for what?
- To whack them.

1247
01:59:14,983 --> 01:59:15,816
The Lingherris?

1248
01:59:15,984 --> 01:59:18,318
The Lingherris and Jacky Marcaggi.

1249
01:59:19,028 --> 01:59:20,529
Whack Marcaggi?

1250
01:59:21,447 --> 01:59:22,489
Whack your boss?

1251
01:59:22,949 --> 01:59:24,741
No one must know.

1252
01:59:25,535 --> 01:59:28,120
You, me, Vettori and no one else.

1253
01:59:28,913 --> 01:59:30,497
It'll take place in Paris.

1254
01:59:30,874 --> 01:59:33,834
Vettori will give you what you need.
He'll supervise

1255
01:59:34,002 --> 01:59:35,919
but we remain invisible.

1256
01:59:36,504 --> 01:59:38,088
Can you do this for me?

1257
01:59:58,234 --> 02:00:00,527
Any plans for when you get out?

1258
02:00:04,324 --> 02:00:08,660
When we get the casinos,
we'll need someone to run them...

1259
02:00:10,038 --> 02:00:11,288
with Lattrache.

1260
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:31,391
We'll do it.

1261
02:00:31,601 --> 02:00:32,726
We'll do it!

1262
02:00:32,894 --> 02:00:33,852
I have 6 months.

1263
02:00:34,520 --> 02:00:36,396
3 up and about.

1264
02:00:36,773 --> 02:00:37,898
Maybe they're wrong.

1265
02:00:38,316 --> 02:00:40,984
Give me a break.
What's the problem?

1266
02:00:41,152 --> 02:00:42,319
Whacking those guys?

1267
02:00:42,695 --> 02:00:44,071
Keep it down.

1268
02:00:44,197 --> 02:00:45,364
We don't know them.

1269
02:00:45,573 --> 02:00:46,782
What do we care?

1270
02:00:47,367 --> 02:00:49,326
Think about when you get out.

1271
02:00:51,037 --> 02:00:52,204
I won't be around.

1272
02:00:52,580 --> 02:00:55,374
You can think about your future.
I can't.

1273
02:00:56,042 --> 02:00:56,792
Malik...

1274
02:00:57,210 --> 02:00:58,210
There's Djamila.

1275
02:00:58,378 --> 02:00:59,419
There's my son.

1276
02:00:59,629 --> 02:01:02,005
What will I leave them?
A fridge? A TV?

1277
02:01:02,298 --> 02:01:04,216
What are you talking about?

1278
02:01:05,218 --> 02:01:07,094
You'll be talking care of them.

1279
02:01:10,056 --> 02:01:11,723
That's what I'm asking.

1280
02:01:12,850 --> 02:01:14,935
Go tell them it's a deal.

1281
02:01:15,103 --> 02:01:16,311
We'll do it.

1282
02:01:40,253 --> 02:01:42,129
I spoke to my friend outside.

1283
02:01:42,755 --> 02:01:43,755
We'll do it.

1284
02:01:44,090 --> 02:01:46,466
He'll tell me
when he finds the guys.

1285
02:01:47,343 --> 02:01:48,885
I'll call my man.

1286
02:01:49,053 --> 02:01:53,015
Give me your friend's number.
Vettori will contact him.

1287
02:02:57,038 --> 02:02:58,413
Ever try this?

1288
02:03:00,333 --> 02:03:01,875
I'll give you a little.

1289
02:04:47,607 --> 02:04:49,024
Are you listening?

1290
02:04:49,358 --> 02:04:50,984
We're heading for disaster.

1291
02:04:51,152 --> 02:04:54,404
Our guys are fine for hash.
For the rest, they suck.

1292
02:04:54,655 --> 02:04:57,532
You wanted to do this.
Just figure it out!

1293
02:04:57,658 --> 02:04:59,034
I can't control them.

1294
02:04:59,452 --> 02:05:01,995
When they saw the guns,
they lost it.

1295
02:05:02,788 --> 02:05:04,331
Right away, like kids.

1296
02:05:04,540 --> 02:05:07,000
That asshole Vettori
treats us like shit.

1297
02:05:07,210 --> 02:05:11,129
During recon, they fought.
Now Khalid wants to kill him.

1298
02:05:13,674 --> 02:05:14,674
Change guys.

1299
02:05:14,884 --> 02:05:15,967
Now?

1300
02:05:16,093 --> 02:05:17,636
- For a contract?
- Who cares?

1301
02:05:20,431 --> 02:05:21,640
One minute.

1302
02:05:28,981 --> 02:05:31,191
I've lost time and money with them.

1303
02:05:32,610 --> 02:05:34,319
Look at the state he's in!

1304
02:05:34,487 --> 02:05:35,487
Watch your mouth!

1305
02:05:35,696 --> 02:05:37,489
I'll put him out of his misery!

1306
02:05:37,657 --> 02:05:39,449
- Hands off!
- Cool it!

1307
02:05:41,494 --> 02:05:44,412
Shut up!
We'll do it, but our way.

1308
02:05:44,997 --> 02:05:47,290
I'm just explaining. Can I?

1309
02:05:49,835 --> 02:05:52,420
Listen to me.
We're going to kill them.

1310
02:05:52,838 --> 02:05:53,797
Promise me.

1311
02:05:54,006 --> 02:05:57,300
We'll kill them
but they can't see it coming.

1312
02:05:57,510 --> 02:05:59,511
Now I'll slap you.
Look down.

1313
02:05:59,929 --> 02:06:00,637
What?

1314
02:06:00,805 --> 02:06:02,931
I'll slap you and you look down.

1315
02:06:07,061 --> 02:06:08,520
Now he gets it.

1316
02:06:09,105 --> 02:06:10,272
Let's move on.

1317
02:06:24,954 --> 02:06:29,082
Pick me up without the others.
You and I will take care of it.

1318
02:06:30,626 --> 02:06:31,835
Will you be able to?

1319
02:06:39,093 --> 02:06:40,176
Guard!

1320
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:44,639
Going to the half-way house
is part of your rehabilitation.

1321
02:06:45,266 --> 02:06:48,310
Yes, Your Honor.
It's a center for convicts...

1322
02:06:48,477 --> 02:06:50,729
I know the Imam Moussab's center.

1323
02:06:52,064 --> 02:06:53,940
You've requested two days.

1324
02:06:54,650 --> 02:06:56,359
That seems a bit much.

1325
02:06:56,736 --> 02:07:00,071
I propose a one-day training module.
7 to 7.

1326
02:07:01,115 --> 02:07:03,116
- Will that do?
- Yeah, very well.

1327
02:07:18,090 --> 02:07:20,216
Mohammed,
peace be with Him,

1328
02:07:20,384 --> 02:07:23,345
arrived on the mountain top
and fell asleep.

1329
02:07:23,763 --> 02:07:26,973
The angel Gabriel appeared.

1330
02:07:27,933 --> 02:07:29,684
Know what he told him?

1331
02:07:29,935 --> 02:07:32,479
He said:
"Recite. Recite, Mohammed.

1332
02:07:32,605 --> 02:07:34,773
"Recite for God who created you.

1333
02:07:34,940 --> 02:07:36,691
"He created mankind
from nothing.

1334
02:07:36,817 --> 02:07:40,278
"Recite what he taught you
with his writings."

1335
02:07:42,740 --> 02:07:44,032
Wondrous!

1336
02:07:44,950 --> 02:07:46,993
Wondrous, my brother!

1337
02:08:09,475 --> 02:08:10,392
The door.

1338
02:08:18,484 --> 02:08:19,651
Have a good day.

1339
02:08:34,834 --> 02:08:36,543
- Where are the others?
- In back.

1340
02:09:06,240 --> 02:09:07,991
The car comes from here.

1341
02:09:10,202 --> 02:09:12,036
One bodyguard, one driver.

1342
02:09:12,246 --> 02:09:14,414
The bodyguard opens the doors.

1343
02:09:18,335 --> 02:09:19,919
He has a bullet-proof vest.

1344
02:09:20,588 --> 02:09:22,255
We let them come out.

1345
02:09:24,550 --> 02:09:26,217
We pop the guard, then them.

1346
02:09:29,221 --> 02:09:30,138
Let's go.

1347
02:10:24,944 --> 02:10:25,652
It's them.

1348
02:10:26,111 --> 02:10:27,195
They're coming.

1349
02:10:27,571 --> 02:10:28,279
Black Chevy.

1350
02:10:29,114 --> 02:10:30,365
Let them get out.

1351
02:10:31,700 --> 02:10:32,951
I'll do the bodyguard.

1352
02:10:58,686 --> 02:10:59,936
What the fuck?

1353
02:11:47,359 --> 02:11:49,402
Move it! Come on!

1354
02:11:52,656 --> 02:11:53,740
See them?

1355
02:11:56,201 --> 02:11:58,161
Okay, now I see them.

1356
02:11:58,954 --> 02:12:00,663
- Three cars ahead.
- Catch up!

1357
02:12:08,213 --> 02:12:09,380
They're turning.

1358
02:12:09,798 --> 02:12:11,507
What now? They're stopping!

1359
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:14,218
- Go on, I'll kill them!
- Kill who?

1360
02:12:14,428 --> 02:12:15,637
It's an armored car!

1361
02:12:16,680 --> 02:12:18,473
It's an armored car, I said.

1362
02:12:19,099 --> 02:12:21,392
Unless you kick them out,
we're fucked.

1363
02:12:29,193 --> 02:12:30,443
What's he doing?

1364
02:12:31,111 --> 02:12:32,236
Buying cigarettes.

1365
02:12:47,586 --> 02:12:48,461
I'm going.

1366
02:12:49,129 --> 02:12:50,421
What are you doing?

1367
02:13:41,473 --> 02:13:42,640
Marcaggi, down!

1368
02:13:44,685 --> 02:13:45,810
Get down!

1369
02:14:18,135 --> 02:14:19,343
I can't hear!

1370
02:14:20,179 --> 02:14:21,929
Can't hear a thing!

1371
02:14:49,708 --> 02:14:50,792
It's not my blood.

1372
02:14:51,376 --> 02:14:52,627
It's theirs.

1373
02:15:10,729 --> 02:15:12,980
You pigs, we fucked you over!

1374
02:15:23,033 --> 02:15:24,450
Are you Jacky Marcaggi?

1375
02:15:26,245 --> 02:15:28,996
Don't talk! I can't hear!
Just nod.

1376
02:15:29,164 --> 02:15:30,289
Know him?

1377
02:15:32,918 --> 02:15:35,586
Your pal Luciani sent us to kill you.

1378
02:15:36,421 --> 02:15:38,381
I won't. I'll leave him to you.

1379
02:15:38,882 --> 02:15:40,049
Take your revenge!

1380
02:15:40,259 --> 02:15:41,676
Let's beat it.

1381
02:16:16,837 --> 02:16:17,753
You sleeping?

1382
02:16:18,589 --> 02:16:20,715
No, I'm not.
I'm exhausted.

1383
02:16:22,593 --> 02:16:24,010
Did you talk to Djamila?

1384
02:16:24,178 --> 02:16:26,220
I'll sleep in the kid's room.

1385
02:16:28,015 --> 02:16:30,308
You don't want to go back tonight?

1386
02:16:30,726 --> 02:16:31,976
I'll go tomorrow.

1387
02:16:34,188 --> 02:16:35,730
You'll do hole time.

1388
02:16:36,648 --> 02:16:39,066
While they tear each other apart.

1389
02:16:41,445 --> 02:16:42,820
You need anything?

1390
02:16:47,784 --> 02:16:49,577
I'm not doing the chemo.

1391
02:16:51,246 --> 02:16:52,830
It's hopeless anyway.

1392
02:17:05,969 --> 02:17:07,261
Watch your sleeve.

1393
02:17:07,471 --> 02:17:09,430
You're wiping your plate.

1394
02:17:14,353 --> 02:17:15,811
Eat some, Ryad.

1395
02:17:16,396 --> 02:17:17,438
I'm eating.

1396
02:17:17,648 --> 02:17:18,856
Want something else?

1397
02:17:19,024 --> 02:17:20,024
No thanks.

1398
02:17:20,609 --> 02:17:22,944
- Good?
- Delicious, thanks.

1399
02:18:42,107 --> 02:18:44,900
El Djebena, Malik.
35-114T.

1400
02:19:59,309 --> 02:20:03,938
40 DAYS 40 NIGHTS

1401
02:21:42,245 --> 02:21:43,537
You there?

1402
02:22:33,129 --> 02:22:34,588
Are you there?

1403
02:26:10,638 --> 02:26:13,307
Make sure it's all there
and sign here.

1404
02:26:40,627 --> 02:26:41,585
Garbage.

1405
02:26:59,687 --> 02:27:01,396
Your release form.

1406
02:27:02,607 --> 02:27:03,524
The door.

1407
02:27:05,527 --> 02:27:07,194
Good luck, El Djebena.

1408
02:27:08,363 --> 02:27:09,571
Good day, sir.

1409
02:27:37,475 --> 02:27:38,433
How are you?

1410
02:27:44,190 --> 02:27:45,399
It's cold.

1411
02:27:45,567 --> 02:27:46,483
Freezing.

1412
02:27:47,777 --> 02:27:49,528
Not a time to be outside.

1413
02:27:56,035 --> 02:27:57,828
- You came by bus?
- Yes.

1414
02:28:00,415 --> 02:28:01,707
When's the next one?

1415
02:28:01,875 --> 02:28:03,333
In half an hour.

1416
02:28:05,837 --> 02:28:07,087
Want to walk a bit?

1417
02:28:07,255 --> 02:28:08,422
If you like.

1418
02:28:09,757 --> 02:28:11,300
Where will you live?

1419
02:28:13,595 --> 02:28:17,556
Come home. I'll take the kid.
Use his bedroom.

1420
02:28:17,724 --> 02:28:20,100
- I don't want to impose.
- You're not.

1421
02:29:00,350 --> 02:29:06,146
A PROPHET
