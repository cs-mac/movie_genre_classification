1
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,676
What did they say?

2
00:03:40,753 --> 00:03:43,085
Did you speak
to the real estate...

3
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,747
Where is she?

4
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,088
Well, well.
Where are her notes?

5
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:49,593
The notes we took with her.

6
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,527
I took the notes?

7
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:53,462
I don't think so.

8
00:03:53,532 --> 00:03:58,435
No. We aren't going
to lose the house.

9
00:03:59,805 --> 00:04:04,242
Look, I'm not minimizing it.

10
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,012
The easement?

11
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,447
Did she say easement?
What did she say?

12
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:15,451
Is it a term of art?

13
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,023
Are we bound by it?

14
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,527
I'm sorry. Are we...

15
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,530
Yes. Bound by it.

16
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,031
Look. Look.

17
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:30,535
Before the other side goes home,
all right?

18
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,434
A term of art.

19
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,541
Because. That's right.

20
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:40,204
The yard for the boy.
That's the whole...

21
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:43,510
I'll meet you there.
Is the realtor there?

22
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,743
Tell her to show you
the basement again.

23
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:50,050
Look at the...
I'm leaving in 10 or 15.

24
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:54,559
Yes. No, no.
I'll meet you at the new house.

25
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:58,620
That's a good...
If he thinks it's necessary.

26
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,666
You tell Jerry to meet,
all right?

27
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:07,331
No, we aren't going to lose
the deposit, all right?

28
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,671
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

29
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,142
I love you, too.

30
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:14,645
I love you, too.

31
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,113
I will.

32
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,182
All right.

33
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,118
What is a term of art?

34
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:27,047
- I'm sorry?
- What is a term of art?

35
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:30,692
Is that what
you want to talk about?

36
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:31,889
To talk about?

37
00:05:31,964 --> 00:05:34,524
Let's take the mysticism
out of it, shall we, Carol?

38
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,363
Don't you think?
I'll tell you.

39
00:05:36,435 --> 00:05:39,461
When you have some thing
which must be broached...

40
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,530
Don't I think? Did I...

41
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,542
Did I say something wrong?

42
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:47,044
No. I'm sorry. No.

43
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,547
You're right.
I'm somewhat rushed, as you see.

44
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,378
I'm very sorry. You're right.

45
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,384
What is a term of art?

46
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:57,218
It seems to mean a term which
has come through its use...

47
00:05:57,289 --> 00:06:00,816
to mean something more specific
than the words would...

48
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:03,453
to someone not acquainted
with them, indicate.

49
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,224
That, I believe, is what
a term of art would mean.

50
00:06:05,297 --> 00:06:06,730
You don't know what it means.

51
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,267
I'm not sure
I know what it means.

52
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,133
It's one of those things
that you look them up...

53
00:06:12,204 --> 00:06:14,229
or have someone
explain them to you...

54
00:06:14,306 --> 00:06:16,536
you say "Aha," and
then you immediately forget.

55
00:06:16,609 --> 00:06:18,577
You don't do that.

56
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:20,578
- Forget things?
- Yes.

57
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:22,079
- Everybody does that.
- No, they don't.

58
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,581
- They don't?
- No.

59
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:26,015
- Everybody does that.
- Why would they do that?

60
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:27,950
I don't know.

61
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,147
Because
it doesn't interest them.

62
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,746
No.

63
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:33,257
I think so, though.

64
00:06:33,325 --> 00:06:34,849
I'm sorry
that I was distracted.

65
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:36,326
You don't
have to say that to me.

66
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,023
You paid me the compliment,
or the obeisance...

67
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:40,395
of coming in here.

68
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:45,393
All right.
Sit down, please.

69
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:53,870
Carol, I find
that I am at a standstill.

70
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,379
- I find...
- What?

71
00:06:55,447 --> 00:06:58,644
One moment.
In regard to your...

72
00:06:58,717 --> 00:07:00,548
You're buying a new house.

73
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:03,816
- No, let's get on with it.
- Get on?

74
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:06,551
Believe me, I know how
potentially humiliating these...

75
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,584
I have no desire
other than to help you.

76
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,824
But... I won't even say but.

77
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,729
I'll say, as I go back...

78
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,894
- I'm just trying...
- No. It will not do.

79
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:20,768
- What will not do?
- Your work.

80
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,933
I sit in class. I take notes.

81
00:07:23,008 --> 00:07:24,441
Yes, I understand.

82
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,876
What I'm trying to tell you
is that some basic...

83
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,346
One moment. Some basic
missed communication...

84
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,508
I'm doing what I'm told.
I bought your book.

85
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:32,812
No, I'm sure you...

86
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:35,877
I'm doing what I'm told.
It's difficult for me.

87
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,855
- Lots of the language...
- Please.

88
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,515
The language...
The things that you say.

89
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,822
I'm sorry, no.
I don't think that that's true.

90
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,385
It is true. Why would I...

91
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,896
I'll tell you why.

92
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:47,694
You're an incredibly
bright girl.

93
00:07:47,766 --> 00:07:50,030
No! You're
an incredibly bright girl.

94
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:53,299
You have no problem with...
No. I'II...

95
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:55,363
Who's kidding who here?

96
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:57,875
I'll tell you why.

97
00:07:57,943 --> 00:07:59,376
I think you're angry.

98
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:01,709
- Why would I...
- Wait one moment.

99
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,304
It is true. I have problems.

100
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:04,542
Everybody...

101
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,279
I come from a different social,
a different economic...

102
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:10,789
- When I came to this school...
- Yes, quite.

103
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,158
Does that mean nothing?

104
00:08:14,226 --> 00:08:17,161
Look, look...
Here, please. Sit down.

105
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:20,626
Sit down.

106
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:40,718
"I think that the ideas
contained in this work...

107
00:08:40,786 --> 00:08:43,277
"express the author's feelings
in a way that he intended...

108
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,118
"based on his results."

109
00:08:47,593 --> 00:08:50,528
What can that mean?
Do you see?

110
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:52,029
The best that I...

111
00:08:52,097 --> 00:08:53,655
I'm saying that perhaps
this course...

112
00:08:53,732 --> 00:08:55,222
No, no, no, you can't.

113
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,462
- How? Carol!
- I have to pass it.

114
00:08:57,536 --> 00:08:59,868
- I have to pass this course.
- Well, either...

115
00:08:59,939 --> 00:09:03,272
Either the criteria for
judging progress in the class...

116
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:05,242
No, no, no!
I have to pass it.

117
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,573
Now, look,
I'm a human being...

118
00:09:06,645 --> 00:09:07,907
I did what you told me.

119
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,505
I did everything.
I read your book.

120
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,447
You told me to buy your book
and read it.

121
00:09:12,518 --> 00:09:14,713
Everything you say, I do.

122
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,220
- Look.
- Everything I'm told.

123
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:19,086
I'm not your father.

124
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:24,556
What?
Did I say you were my father?

125
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,326
- No.
- Why did you say that?

126
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:29,367
Why did you say that to me?

127
00:09:50,055 --> 00:09:52,922
Hello. Yes. Jerry.

128
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,017
I know what time it is.

129
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,495
Yes, I'm trying to get
out of here, believe me.

130
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,624
Why do we need these notes?

131
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:06,705
You're right.
I'm going to find my notes.

132
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,511
I'll be there in ten minutes.

133
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:33,293
What is it you would have me do?

134
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:35,458
We are two people, all right?

135
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,799
Both of whom have subscribed
to certain arbitrary...

136
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:40,202
You have to help me.

137
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,435
Certain institutional forms.
That's right.

138
00:10:43,509 --> 00:10:46,501
You may say
they are false or arbitrary.

139
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:49,103
- You have to help me.
- Excuse me one moment, please.

140
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:51,649
- You have to help me.
- Excuse me.

141
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:57,388
I've had a long day,
and it is not over yet.

142
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:58,980
That's not your problem.
I understand.

143
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,255
- You have to help me.
- What do you want me to do?

144
00:11:02,327 --> 00:11:03,988
How can I go back
and tell them the grades...

145
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,328
I'm sorry for you. I am.

146
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,560
There is... you're right...

147
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:13,093
a harshness in
the methodology of grading.

148
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:16,107
But we have accepted it,
both of us.

149
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,369
And for better or worse...

150
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:21,072
we must abide by the system
which we have chosen...

151
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,114
don't you think?

152
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,117
I think so.
I thank you for coming in.

153
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,812
If you'd like to reschedule
an appointment...

154
00:11:27,886 --> 00:11:29,183
with my office
for a future time...

155
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,950
I'd be happy to talk
with you then. Thank you.

156
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:16,230
What do you want me to do?

157
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:19,327
Teach me.
I want you to teach me.

158
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:21,872
- I tried to teach you.
- I read your book.

159
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,874
- You don't understand it.
- No.

160
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:25,500
Perhaps it's not well written.

161
00:12:25,577 --> 00:12:28,137
No, no.
I want to understand it.

162
00:12:28,213 --> 00:12:29,874
What don't you understand?

163
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:32,473
Any of it.

164
00:12:32,551 --> 00:12:35,816
What you're trying to say
when you talk about...

165
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,219
Yes?

166
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:40,520
"Virtual warehousing
of the young."

167
00:12:40,592 --> 00:12:42,651
Virtual warehousing
of the young.

168
00:12:42,728 --> 00:12:45,322
If we artificially
prolong adolescence...

169
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,888
And about the curse
of modern education.

170
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:52,062
Look, it's just a course.
It's just a book.

171
00:12:52,137 --> 00:12:54,162
No. There are people
out there...

172
00:12:54,239 --> 00:12:56,935
people who came here to know
something they didn't know.

173
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,739
Who came here to be helped.

174
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:01,745
So someone
would help them...

175
00:13:01,813 --> 00:13:04,043
to do something,
to know something.

176
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,914
What do they say?
To get on in the world.

177
00:13:06,985 --> 00:13:09,419
How can I do that if I fail?

178
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,921
But I don't understand.

179
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,423
I don't understand
what anything means.

180
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,221
And I walk around
from morning till night...

181
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,626
with this one thought
in my head... I'm stupid.

182
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,129
No one thinks you're stupid.

183
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,429
- What am I, then?
- I think you're angry.

184
00:13:24,503 --> 00:13:26,767
Many people are.

185
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,899
I have an appointment
I have to make...

186
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,068
an appointment
which is rather pressing.

187
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,736
Though I sympathize
with your concerns...

188
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,746
and though
I wish I had the time...

189
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,748
this was not
a previously scheduled meeting.

190
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,477
You think I'm nothing.

191
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:41,815
I have an appointment
with a realtor and my wife.

192
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,151
- You think I'm stupid.
- No, I certainly do not.

193
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,987
- You said it. You did.
- When? No, I never did.

194
00:13:47,059 --> 00:13:49,493
Or never would say that
to a student.

195
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,394
You said,
"What can that mean?"

196
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,228
"What can that mean?"

197
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,562
What did that mean to you?

198
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:58,466
That I'm stupid
and I'll never learn.

199
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,334
That's what that meant,
and you're right.

200
00:14:00,405 --> 00:14:02,339
But, then,
what am I doing here?

201
00:14:02,407 --> 00:14:03,840
If you thought I...

202
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,900
Nobody wants me,
and nobody tells me anything.

203
00:14:05,978 --> 00:14:08,242
And I sit there
in the corner in the back...

204
00:14:08,313 --> 00:14:10,304
and everybody's talking
about this all the time...

205
00:14:10,382 --> 00:14:13,715
and concepts and precepts and...

206
00:14:13,785 --> 00:14:17,482
What in the world
are you talking about?

207
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:18,682
And I read your book...

208
00:14:18,757 --> 00:14:20,088
and they said,
"Fine, go in that class"...

209
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:22,854
because you talked about
responsibility to the young.

210
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,590
I don't know what it means,
and I'm failing.

211
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:27,427
- Maybe...
- No, you're right.

212
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:29,967
I failed. Flunk me out.
It's garbage.

213
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,161
Everything I do...

214
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:33,067
"The ideas
contained in this work...

215
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,197
"express the author's feelings."

216
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,003
That's right.

217
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:40,135
I know I'm stupid.
I know what I am.

218
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,703
I know what I am, Professor.
You don't have to tell me.

219
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:44,408
It's pathetic, isn't it?

220
00:14:44,483 --> 00:14:47,680
Uh-huh. Sit down.

221
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,186
Sit down, please?

222
00:14:49,254 --> 00:14:50,687
Please, sit down.

223
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,691
- Why?
- I want to talk to you.

224
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:56,387
- Why?
- Just sit down, please.

225
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:57,894
Sit down!

226
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,931
Will you, please?

227
00:15:04,336 --> 00:15:05,633
What?

228
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:07,569
I know what
you're talking about.

229
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,765
No, you don't.

230
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,808
- I think I do.
- How can you?

231
00:15:10,876 --> 00:15:13,310
I'll tell you a story
about myself.

232
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:14,811
Do you mind?

233
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,405
I was raised
to think myself stupid.

234
00:15:17,482 --> 00:15:18,915
What do you mean?

235
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,714
Just what I said.
I was brought up...

236
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,017
and my earliest and
most persistent memories...

237
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,319
are of being told
that I was stupid.

238
00:15:26,391 --> 00:15:27,824
"You have such intelligence.

239
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:30,327
"Why must
you behave so stupidly?"

240
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:32,329
Or "Can't you understand?"

241
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:34,524
And I could not understand.

242
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,759
What?

243
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,166
The simplest problem
was beyond me.

244
00:15:38,236 --> 00:15:39,396
It was a mystery.

245
00:15:39,471 --> 00:15:42,929
- What was a mystery?
- How people learn.

246
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,441
How I could learn.

247
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,909
Which is what
I've been speaking of in class.

248
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:49,208
And, of course,
you can't hear it, Carol.

249
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,942
Of course you can't.

250
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,951
If you are told...
Listen to this...

251
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:57,955
If the young child is told
that he cannot understand...

252
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:00,890
then he takes it
as a description of himself.

253
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,392
What am I?

254
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,895
I am that
which cannot understand.

255
00:16:04,963 --> 00:16:06,828
And I saw you back there...

256
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:08,195
when we were speaking
of the concept...

257
00:16:08,266 --> 00:16:10,598
I can't understand any of them.

258
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:12,603
Then that's my fault.

259
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,607
That is not your fault.
And that is not verbiage.

260
00:16:16,675 --> 00:16:20,611
That is what I firmly hold
to be the truth.

261
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,374
And I'm sorry.

262
00:16:22,447 --> 00:16:26,543
And I owe you an apology.

263
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,915
Why?

264
00:16:27,986 --> 00:16:32,047
I suppose I've had
some things on my mind.

265
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,318
We're buying a house...

266
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:35,656
People said
that you were stupid?

267
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:37,058
Yes.

268
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:38,653
Yes.

269
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,425
When?

270
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,831
I'll tell you when.
Through my life.

271
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,334
In my childhood.

272
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,564
Perhaps they stopped,
but I heard them continue.

273
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,128
And what did they say?

274
00:16:48,206 --> 00:16:51,334
They said I was incompetent.
You see?

275
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:55,972
And when I am tested,
the feelings of my youth...

276
00:16:56,047 --> 00:16:58,106
about the very subject
of learning come up...

277
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:03,018
and I feel
unworthy and unprepared...

278
00:17:03,088 --> 00:17:06,717
- Yes.
- And I feel that I must fail.

279
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:08,783
But then you do fail.

280
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,828
You have to, don't you?

281
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:15,660
A pilot... flying a plane.

282
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,201
The pilot is flying the plane.

283
00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:19,669
He thinks, "Oh, my God,
my mind's been drifting.

284
00:17:19,738 --> 00:17:22,707
"Oh, my God, what kind of
a cursed imbecile am I...

285
00:17:22,774 --> 00:17:25,937
"that I, with so precious
a cargo of life in my charge...

286
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,979
"would allow my attention
to wander?

287
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:29,604
"Why was I born?

288
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,149
"How deluded are those
who put their trust in me?"

289
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,913
Et cetera and so on.
And he crashes the plane.

290
00:17:34,986 --> 00:17:38,046
- He could just...
- That's right.

291
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:39,420
"My attention
wandered for a moment."

292
00:17:39,491 --> 00:17:42,688
"I had a thought
I did not like, but now..."

293
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:43,955
That's what I'm telling you.

294
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:46,259
"It's time
to put my attention..."

295
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:48,196
You see, it is not...

296
00:17:48,266 --> 00:17:50,257
It is not magic.

297
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,236
I know in situations like these,
you will think...

298
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,239
"I must, but I can't."

299
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:57,434
And you will think,
"Why was I born...

300
00:17:57,509 --> 00:17:59,067
"to be the laughingstock
of a world...

301
00:17:59,144 --> 00:18:00,873
"in which everyone
is better than I...

302
00:18:00,946 --> 00:18:02,641
"where I am
entitled to nothing...

303
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:04,443
"where I cannot learn?"

304
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:06,746
All right.

305
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,418
I'm never going
to get out of here today.

306
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,425
Is that what I have?

307
00:18:14,493 --> 00:18:18,725
I don't know
if I'd put it that way.

308
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,790
Listen...

309
00:18:21,867 --> 00:18:24,563
I'm talking to you...

310
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,537
as I would talk to my son...

311
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,540
because that's what I'd like
him to have that I never had.

312
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,544
I'm talking to you the way
I wish someone talked to me.

313
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,546
I don't know how to do it...

314
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,548
other than to be personal
with you, but...

315
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,311
Why would you want
to be personal with me?

316
00:18:39,384 --> 00:18:40,783
You see,
that's what I'm saying.

317
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:43,047
We can only interpret
the behavior of others...

318
00:18:43,121 --> 00:18:45,453
through the screen...

319
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:47,048
Oh, Lord.

320
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,093
...the screen we create.

321
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,489
Hello.

322
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,828
Excuse me a moment.
Hello.

323
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,333
No, I'm coming down.

324
00:18:56,401 --> 00:18:59,336
I know I did. In a few...

325
00:18:59,404 --> 00:19:01,269
Is he coming to the...

326
00:19:01,339 --> 00:19:02,772
Yes, I talked to him.

327
00:19:02,841 --> 00:19:04,775
We'll meet you at the...

328
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,277
No. I've been with a student.

329
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:09,279
It's going to be...

330
00:19:09,347 --> 00:19:12,282
This is important, too.

331
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,218
Jerry's going to...
I've been with a student.

332
00:19:17,355 --> 00:19:19,789
How can you say that?

333
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,656
I've... Look.

334
00:19:22,727 --> 00:19:24,592
The sooner I get off,
the sooner I'll be down.

335
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:28,292
Isn't that evident?
I love you.

336
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:31,802
Listen... Listen.
I said I love you.

337
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,361
It's going to work out
with the house.

338
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:36,873
Because I feel that it is.

339
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,376
All right,
I'll be right down.

340
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:41,708
Yes, all right, I did.

341
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:44,977
I'm saying it yet again.
I'll be right...

342
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,678
It's going to take
as long as it takes!

343
00:19:56,561 --> 00:19:58,222
What was that?

344
00:19:59,564 --> 00:20:01,691
There are some problems,
as there usually are...

345
00:20:01,766 --> 00:20:05,793
about the final agreements
for the new house.

346
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,805
You're buying a new house.

347
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,534
That's right.

348
00:20:11,576 --> 00:20:13,476
Because of your promotion.

349
00:20:16,014 --> 00:20:18,244
I suppose that's right.

350
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,080
Why did you stay here with me?

351
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:25,589
- Stay here?
- Yes. When you should have gone.

352
00:20:27,425 --> 00:20:29,359
Because I like you.

353
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,363
- You like me?
- Yes.

354
00:20:33,431 --> 00:20:34,864
Why?

355
00:20:34,933 --> 00:20:36,230
Why?

356
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:40,763
Perhaps we're similar.

357
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:48,045
You said everyone has problems.

358
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,546
Everyone has problems.

359
00:20:49,614 --> 00:20:51,673
- Do they?
- Certainly.

360
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,378
- You do.
- Yes.

361
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:56,181
What are they?

362
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,620
Well...

363
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:06,289
you are absolutely right.

364
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:09,299
I'm going to take off
the artificial stricture...

365
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,925
of teacher and student.

366
00:21:11,002 --> 00:21:14,494
Why should my problems be any
more a mystery than your own?

367
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:20,344
Of course I have problems,
as you saw.

368
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,347
- With what?
- With my wife. With work.

369
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,939
Tell me.

370
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,414
Would you like a cup of tea?

371
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:14,291
As I was saying,
I came late to teaching.

372
00:22:14,365 --> 00:22:16,833
And I found it artificial...

373
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:20,860
the notion of
"I know, and you do not."

374
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,499
I told you, I hated school.

375
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,406
I hated teachers.

376
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,809
I hated anyone who was
in a position of a boss...

377
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:31,315
because I knew...
I didn't think, mind you...

378
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:33,816
I knew I was going to fail.

379
00:22:33,885 --> 00:22:36,581
Late in life,
when I got out from under...

380
00:22:36,654 --> 00:22:39,987
when I worked my way out
of the need to fail...

381
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:41,719
How do you do that?

382
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,852
I'm going to tell you.

383
00:22:43,928 --> 00:22:45,657
You have to look
at what you are...

384
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:48,460
and what you feel
and how you act.

385
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:52,094
And finally, you have to look at
how you act...

386
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:53,967
and say,
"If that's what I did...

387
00:22:54,038 --> 00:22:56,472
"that must be what
I think of myself."

388
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:57,906
I don't understand.

389
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:00,240
If I fail all the time...

390
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:03,041
it must be that I think
of myself as a failure.

391
00:23:03,114 --> 00:23:06,140
If I don't want to think
of myself as a failure...

392
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:09,345
perhaps I should begin
by succeeding now and again.

393
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,981
Look. The tests, you see...

394
00:23:13,057 --> 00:23:16,322
which you encounter
in school...

395
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,487
in college, in life...

396
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,329
were designed for idiots
by idiots.

397
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,231
There's no need to fail at them.

398
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:25,826
They're not
a test of your worth.

399
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,565
They are a test of
your ability...

400
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,937
to retain and spout back
misinformation.

401
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,943
Of course you fail them.
They're nonsense.

402
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,377
No. No.

403
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:38,279
Yes. They're garbage.

404
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:39,475
They're a joke.

405
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,451
How can you say that?

406
00:23:41,519 --> 00:23:44,454
Look at me.

407
00:23:44,522 --> 00:23:45,955
The tenure committee.

408
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,959
The tenure committee
come to judge me.

409
00:23:49,027 --> 00:23:50,995
The bad tenure committee.

410
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:53,087
The test. You see?

411
00:23:53,164 --> 00:23:54,995
They put me to the test.

412
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,226
They had people
voting on me...

413
00:23:56,301 --> 00:23:58,326
I wouldn't
employ to wax my car.

414
00:23:58,403 --> 00:24:01,463
And yet I go before
the great tenure committee...

415
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,531
I have an urge to vomit...

416
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:08,807
to puke my badness
on the table... to show them.

417
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,008
I'm no good.
Why would you pick me?

418
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,710
They granted you tenure.

419
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,219
Oh, no. They announced it.

420
00:24:16,287 --> 00:24:18,312
But they haven't signed.

421
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:21,187
You see? At any moment.

422
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,660
They might not sign.

423
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:27,391
The house might not go through.

424
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:32,098
They'll find out my dark secret.

425
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,330
What is it?

426
00:24:35,406 --> 00:24:38,068
There isn't one.

427
00:24:38,142 --> 00:24:41,077
But they'll find
an index of my badness.

428
00:24:41,145 --> 00:24:44,342
- Index?
- A pointer.

429
00:24:44,415 --> 00:24:47,213
A pointer. You see?

430
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:48,809
You see?

431
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,755
I understand you.
I know that feeling.

432
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,759
Am I entitled to my job
and my nice house...

433
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,058
and my wife, my family?
This is what I am saying.

434
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,690
That theory
of education which...

435
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,462
- I... I...
- What?

436
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,662
I want to know about my grade.

437
00:25:12,777 --> 00:25:14,301
Of course you do.

438
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,973
- Is that bad?
- No.

439
00:25:17,048 --> 00:25:20,142
- Is it bad that I asked you?
- No.

440
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:25,017
And I apologize.

441
00:25:25,089 --> 00:25:28,252
Of course you want to know
about your grade.

442
00:25:28,326 --> 00:25:30,351
Of course you can't
concentrate on any...

443
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:35,331
Wait a moment.

444
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,925
- I should go.
- I'll make you a deal.

445
00:25:38,002 --> 00:25:39,936
You have to take the call.

446
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:41,437
Let it ring.
I'll make you a deal.

447
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,666
You stay here.

448
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,435
I'm going to say... Stay here.

449
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,444
I'm going to say
it was not you...

450
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:50,447
it was I who was
not paying attention.

451
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,983
We'll start
the whole course over.

452
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,117
Your grade is an "A."

453
00:26:01,192 --> 00:26:03,854
Your final grade is an "A."

454
00:26:03,928 --> 00:26:05,953
But the class is only half over.

455
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,965
Your grade for
the whole term is an "A"...

456
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:10,933
if you will come back
and meet with me...

457
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:12,799
a few more times.

458
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,134
Forget about the paper.
You didn't like it.

459
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,571
You didn't like writing it.

460
00:26:16,641 --> 00:26:17,869
It's not important.

461
00:26:17,942 --> 00:26:20,274
What's important is
that I awake your interest...

462
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,939
and that
I answer your questions.

463
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,312
- Let's start over.
- With what?

464
00:26:25,383 --> 00:26:26,611
Say this is the beginning.

465
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:29,312
- Of what?
- The class.

466
00:26:29,387 --> 00:26:31,981
- But we can't start over.
- I say we can.

467
00:26:32,056 --> 00:26:34,684
- I say we can.
- But I don't believe it.

468
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,624
I know, but it's true.

469
00:26:36,694 --> 00:26:38,992
What is the class,
but you and me?

470
00:26:39,063 --> 00:26:40,655
There are rules.

471
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,199
Well...

472
00:26:43,501 --> 00:26:45,731
- We'll break them.
- How can we?

473
00:26:45,803 --> 00:26:47,134
We won't tell anybody.

474
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:48,638
Is that all right?

475
00:26:48,706 --> 00:26:50,503
I say that it's fine.

476
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:52,770
Why would you do this for me?

477
00:26:52,844 --> 00:26:54,505
I like you.

478
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:57,639
Is that so difficult
for you to...

479
00:26:57,715 --> 00:27:00,616
There's nobody here
but you and me.

480
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,152
All right!

481
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:09,520
I did not understand
when you referred...

482
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,822
All right. Yes?

483
00:27:11,863 --> 00:27:15,355
When you referred to "hazing."

484
00:27:15,433 --> 00:27:17,663
You wrote in your book
about the comparative...

485
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:19,828
- Yes? Yes?
- The comparative...

486
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,098
- Are you checking your notes?
- Yes.

487
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,298
Tell me in your own words.

488
00:27:22,373 --> 00:27:23,772
I want to make sure
I have it right.

489
00:27:23,841 --> 00:27:25,069
Of course.
You want to be exact.

490
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,304
I want to know
everything that went on...

491
00:27:27,378 --> 00:27:28,777
That's very good.

492
00:27:28,846 --> 00:27:32,213
I was suggesting, many times
that which we wish to retain...

493
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:36,481
is retained oftentimes better
with less expenditure of effort.

494
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:38,784
Here it is.
You wrote of "hazing."

495
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:42,189
That's correct.
Now, I said "hazing."

496
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,990
It means ritualized annoyance.

497
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:48,157
We shove this book at you.
We say, read it.

498
00:27:48,232 --> 00:27:52,032
You say you've read it.
I think you're lying.

499
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:53,331
I'll grill you.

500
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:55,133
And when I find out
you've lied...

501
00:27:55,206 --> 00:27:58,607
you'll be disgraced,
and your life will be ruined.

502
00:27:58,676 --> 00:28:01,270
It's a sick game.
Why do we do it?

503
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:04,371
Does it educate?
In no sense.

504
00:28:04,449 --> 00:28:07,282
Well, then, tell me this...

505
00:28:07,351 --> 00:28:09,285
what is higher education?

506
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:11,378
It is something other
than useful.

507
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:13,390
What is something
other than useful?

508
00:28:13,458 --> 00:28:14,720
All right.
That's a good question.

509
00:28:14,792 --> 00:28:17,317
It has become a ritual...

510
00:28:17,395 --> 00:28:19,124
it has become
an article of faith...

511
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,960
that all must be subjected to.

512
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:22,659
Or to put it differently...

513
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,201
that all are entitled
to higher education.

514
00:28:25,269 --> 00:28:28,033
- And my point...
- You disagree with that.

515
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:31,803
Let's address that.
What do you think?

516
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,707
I don't know.

517
00:28:33,778 --> 00:28:36,110
What do you think, though?

518
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:39,781
I don't know.

519
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,309
I spoke of it in class.
Do you remember my example?

520
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:44,752
Justice.

521
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:47,689
Can you repeat it to me
without your notes?

522
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,020
I ask you as a favor to me...

523
00:28:49,093 --> 00:28:52,358
so I can see
if my idea was interesting.

524
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:56,025
- You said justice.
- Yes...

525
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,536
That all are entitled to...

526
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:05,408
Yes. To a speedy trial.

527
00:29:05,476 --> 00:29:06,773
To a fair trial.

528
00:29:06,844 --> 00:29:10,041
But they needn't be given
a trial at all...

529
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,775
unless they stand accused.

530
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,840
Justice is their right.

531
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,579
Should they choose to avail
themselves of it...

532
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,780
they should have a fair trial.

533
00:29:17,855 --> 00:29:20,289
It does not follow
of necessity...

534
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:22,087
that a person's life
is incomplete...

535
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,685
without a trial in it.
You see?

536
00:29:24,762 --> 00:29:28,493
My point is,
a confusion between...

537
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:31,694
equity and utility arose.

538
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,261
So that we confound
the usefulness...

539
00:29:35,339 --> 00:29:38,934
of higher education
with our granted right...

540
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,307
to equal access to the same.

541
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,313
We, in effect,
create a prejudice toward it...

542
00:29:43,381 --> 00:29:44,814
completely independent of...

543
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:47,646
That it is prejudice
we should go to school?

544
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:50,346
- Exactly.
- How can you say that?

545
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,116
Good. That's right.

546
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,624
Speak up.
What is a prejudice?

547
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,661
An unreasoned belief.
We all are subject to it.

548
00:29:57,728 --> 00:29:59,093
None of us is not.

549
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:01,028
When it is threatened
or opposed...

550
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,690
we feel anger.

551
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:05,930
And we feel, do we not,
as you do now?

552
00:30:06,003 --> 00:30:08,767
- Do you not? Good.
- But how can you...

553
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:11,171
Yes. Let us examine. Good.

554
00:30:11,242 --> 00:30:14,211
I believe that I'm speaking!

555
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,129
I...

556
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,375
I'm sorry
that I interrupted you.

557
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,003
- That's all right.
- You were saying?

558
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,570
I was saying...

559
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,081
I was saying...

560
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:55,084
how can you say
in a college class...

561
00:30:55,152 --> 00:30:57,177
that college education
is prejudiced?

562
00:30:57,255 --> 00:30:59,189
I said that
our predilection for it...

563
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,158
- Predilection?
- You know what that means?

564
00:31:02,226 --> 00:31:05,525
- Does it mean liking?
- Yes.

565
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,531
But how can you say
that college is...

566
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:10,533
That's my job, don't you know?

567
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:12,831
- What is?
- To provoke you.

568
00:31:12,903 --> 00:31:14,530
No.

569
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,402
Oh, yes, though.

570
00:31:16,474 --> 00:31:18,908
- To provoke me?
- That's right.

571
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,967
- To make me mad?
- That's right.

572
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:24,481
- To force you...
- To make me mad is your job?

573
00:31:24,548 --> 00:31:27,346
To force you to...

574
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,352
Listen...

575
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,910
Sit down.

576
00:31:32,923 --> 00:31:36,359
When I was young,
somebody told me...

577
00:31:36,427 --> 00:31:37,860
Are you ready?

578
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:40,863
The rich copulate
less often than the poor.

579
00:31:40,931 --> 00:31:42,364
But when they do...

580
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:45,300
they take more of
their clothes off.

581
00:31:45,369 --> 00:31:47,394
Years!

582
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:48,870
Years, mind you...

583
00:31:48,939 --> 00:31:51,840
I would compare experiences
of my own to this dictum...

584
00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:54,343
saying,
"Aha. This fits the norm."

585
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,403
Or "This is
a variation from it."

586
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,041
What did it mean? Nothing.

587
00:32:00,117 --> 00:32:02,312
It was just some jerk thing
some school kid told me...

588
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:05,321
that took up room
inside my head.

589
00:32:05,389 --> 00:32:07,254
Somebody told you...

590
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:10,317
and you hold it
as an article of faith...

591
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:13,522
that higher education
is an unassailable good.

592
00:32:13,597 --> 00:32:15,030
This notion is so dear to you...

593
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,533
that when I question it,
you become angry.

594
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,592
Good, I say.

595
00:32:19,670 --> 00:32:23,470
Are not those the very things
which we should question?

596
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:28,308
I say college education
since the war...

597
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,075
has become
so a matter of course...

598
00:32:31,148 --> 00:32:33,116
and such
a fashionable necessity...

599
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:34,310
for those either of...

600
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:36,853
or aspiring to,
the new vast middle class...

601
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,719
that we espouse it
as a matter of right...

602
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:43,226
and have ceased to ask
what is it good for?

603
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,854
You see my point?

604
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:50,867
What might be some reasons for
the pursuit of higher education?

605
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,362
One... a love of learning.

606
00:32:55,439 --> 00:32:59,705
Two... the wish for mastery
of a skill.

607
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:05,773
Three...
for economic betterment.

608
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,330
I'm keeping you.

609
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:28,338
One moment.
I have to make a note.

610
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:29,839
It's something that I said.

611
00:33:29,907 --> 00:33:32,137
No. We're buying a house.

612
00:33:32,209 --> 00:33:34,336
You're buying a new house?

613
00:33:34,412 --> 00:33:37,472
To go with the tenure.
That's right.

614
00:33:37,548 --> 00:33:41,848
Nice house.
Close to the private school.

615
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,353
We were speaking
of economic betterment...

616
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:47,186
and I was thinking
of the school tax.

617
00:33:47,258 --> 00:33:48,452
School tax?

618
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,357
Where is it written...

619
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:56,663
that I have to send my child
to public school?

620
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:58,395
Is it a law...

621
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:01,802
that I must improve
the city's schools...

622
00:34:01,872 --> 00:34:06,673
at the expense
of my own interest?

623
00:34:06,744 --> 00:34:09,804
And is this not simply...

624
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,815
a case of...

625
00:34:12,883 --> 00:34:14,817
quote...

626
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:18,878
the white man's burden?

627
00:34:18,956 --> 00:34:21,220
End quotation.

628
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,053
Good.

629
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,699
Does this interest you?

630
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,102
No. I'm taking notes.

631
00:34:35,172 --> 00:34:38,801
You don't have to take notes.
You can just listen.

632
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:42,778
I want to make sure
I remember it.

633
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:44,075
I'm not lecturing you.

634
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,810
I'm just telling you
some things that I think.

635
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:48,545
What do you think?

636
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:56,015
Should all kids go to college?
Why?

637
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:57,822
- To learn.
- But if he does not learn?

638
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:01,296
- Lf the child does not learn?
- Why is he in college?

639
00:35:01,398 --> 00:35:03,366
Because he was told
it was his right?

640
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,334
Some might find college
instructive.

641
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:06,664
I would hope so.

642
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:09,934
How do they feel being told
they're wasting their time?

643
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,941
I don't think
I'm telling them that.

644
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:14,341
You said...

645
00:35:14,411 --> 00:35:19,713
"Education was prolonged
and systematic hazing."

646
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:21,478
Yes, it can be so.

647
00:35:21,552 --> 00:35:24,248
If education is so bad,
why do you do it?

648
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:27,449
I do it because I love it.

649
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:29,753
Let's...

650
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:31,988
I suggest...

651
00:35:32,062 --> 00:35:34,223
you look at the demographics.

652
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,823
"Wage-earning capacity.

653
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:43,363
"College and noncollege-educated
men and women, 1855 to 1980."

654
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,375
Let's see if we can wring some
worth from these statistics...

655
00:35:46,443 --> 00:35:48,377
- No.
- What?

656
00:35:48,445 --> 00:35:50,970
I can't understand them...
the charts, the concepts.

657
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,276
Charts are simply a tool...

658
00:35:52,349 --> 00:35:54,613
When I leave here...
No, I can't.

659
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,882
- You can, though.
- No, I don't understand.

660
00:35:57,955 --> 00:35:59,718
- What?
- Any of it.

661
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,020
Any of it.
I'm smiling in class.

662
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,617
I'm smiling the whole time.
What are you talking about?

663
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,425
What is everyone talking about?
I don't understand.

664
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,830
I don't know
what it means to be here.

665
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,334
You tell me I'm intelligent...

666
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:13,563
then you tell me
I shouldn't be here.

667
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:14,968
- It's all right.
- I don't understand!

668
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,734
What do you mean?
Who should I listen to?

669
00:36:16,807 --> 00:36:18,297
Easy!

670
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:39,760
I don't understand you.

671
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,865
I know. It's all right.

672
00:36:42,933 --> 00:36:45,493
- I...
- What?

673
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:47,161
I...

674
00:36:47,237 --> 00:36:49,762
- What? Tell me.
- I can't tell you.

675
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,138
- No. You must.
- I can't.

676
00:36:52,209 --> 00:36:53,699
No. Tell me.

677
00:36:55,579 --> 00:36:56,876
I'm bad!

678
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:05,582
Oh, God.

679
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,221
It's all right.

680
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm...

681
00:37:09,593 --> 00:37:11,151
It's all right.

682
00:37:11,228 --> 00:37:12,923
I can't talk about this.

683
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:16,330
It's all right. Tell me.

684
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,527
Why do you want to know this?

685
00:37:18,602 --> 00:37:20,536
I don't want to know.
I want to know...

686
00:37:20,604 --> 00:37:22,697
- I always...
- Good.

687
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,172
I always...

688
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:30,675
All of my life...

689
00:37:32,916 --> 00:37:36,875
I have never told anyone this.

690
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,285
Go on.

691
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,186
Go on.

692
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,885
- All of my life...
- Yes?

693
00:37:58,175 --> 00:37:59,870
I can't talk now.

694
00:37:59,943 --> 00:38:01,911
What?

695
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:03,742
Wait a second.

696
00:38:03,814 --> 00:38:06,044
I don't get it.

697
00:38:06,116 --> 00:38:08,380
You talking about the realtor?

698
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,044
She said what?

699
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,356
Hold on.

700
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:22,831
What? She what?

701
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,892
She can't.

702
00:38:25,969 --> 00:38:27,834
She said
the agreement is void.

703
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:31,341
How?
How is the agreement void?

704
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:34,844
That's our house.
I have the paper.

705
00:38:34,912 --> 00:38:37,642
When we come down next week
with the payment and paper...

706
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:41,344
that house is...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

707
00:38:41,418 --> 00:38:44,182
Did Jerry... Is Jerry there?

708
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:47,849
Is she there?
Does she have a lawyer?

709
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,088
How the hell?

710
00:38:51,161 --> 00:38:54,358
It's a question, you said,
of the easement.

711
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:56,991
I don't understand.
It's not the whole agreement.

712
00:38:57,067 --> 00:39:00,298
It's just the easement.
Why would she...

713
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:03,533
Put Jerry on.

714
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,311
Jerry, what the hell?

715
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:12,815
That's my house.
I'm not coming down.

716
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:16,444
Listen, screw her!

717
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,010
I want you to take Grace...

718
00:39:18,088 --> 00:39:19,316
you get out of that house.

719
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:21,823
You leave her there,
her and her lawyer.

720
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:24,622
And you tell her
we'll see them in court next...

721
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,630
No, leave her there!
Leave her to stew in it.

722
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,598
You tell her
we're getting that house...

723
00:39:29,666 --> 00:39:31,099
and we are going to...

724
00:39:31,168 --> 00:39:33,363
No, I am not coming down.

725
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,928
I'll be damned
if I'll sit in the same...

726
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:39,339
You tell her next time
we see her is in court.

727
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:42,674
I... What?

728
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,213
What?

729
00:39:45,916 --> 00:39:48,680
I don't understand.

730
00:39:48,752 --> 00:39:51,084
What about the house?

731
00:39:52,422 --> 00:39:55,255
There isn't any problem
with the hou...

732
00:39:58,428 --> 00:40:00,862
No, that's all right.

733
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:03,866
I'II... All right.

734
00:40:03,934 --> 00:40:06,767
Of course.

735
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:10,170
No. I will. Right away.

736
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:25,479
What is it?

737
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:31,757
It's a surprise party.

738
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,389
- It is?
- Yes.

739
00:40:34,464 --> 00:40:36,125
A party for you?

740
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,895
Yes.

741
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:40,402
Is it your birthday?

742
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,906
- No.
- What is it?

743
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:46,534
The tenure announcement.

744
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,306
The tenure announcement?

745
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:51,745
They're throwing a party for us
in our new house.

746
00:40:51,815 --> 00:40:54,613
- Your new house?
- The house that we're buying.

747
00:40:54,685 --> 00:40:57,210
You have to go.

748
00:40:57,287 --> 00:41:00,222
It seems that I do.

749
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,123
They're proud of you.

750
00:41:04,461 --> 00:41:08,158
There are those who would say
it's a form of aggression.

751
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:10,996
What is?

752
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,127
A surprise.

753
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,892
You see, I love to teach.

754
00:43:17,961 --> 00:43:20,987
And I flatter myself
I'm skilled at it.

755
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:23,362
And I love the aspect
of performance.

756
00:43:23,433 --> 00:43:25,833
I think I must confess that.

757
00:43:25,902 --> 00:43:28,996
When I found I love to teach...

758
00:43:29,072 --> 00:43:31,063
I swore that
I would not become...

759
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,405
that cold, rigid automaton
of an instructor...

760
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:36,344
which I had encountered
as a child.

761
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,813
Now, I was not unconscious...

762
00:43:38,882 --> 00:43:40,850
that it was given me
to err upon the other side.

763
00:43:40,917 --> 00:43:43,818
And so I asked
and asked myself...

764
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:46,355
if I had engaged in heterodoxy...

765
00:43:46,423 --> 00:43:48,357
I will not say gratuitously...

766
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:50,518
for I do not care
to posit orthodoxy...

767
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:52,528
as a given good...

768
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,162
But to the detriment
of my students.

769
00:44:00,871 --> 00:44:02,031
Yes.

770
00:44:03,874 --> 00:44:05,432
As I said...

771
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,808
when the possibility
of tenure opened...

772
00:44:08,879 --> 00:44:12,542
and, of course,
I had long pursued it...

773
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,950
I was, of course,
happy and covetous of it.

774
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,984
I asked myself
if I was wrong to covet it...

775
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:27,326
and thought about it long
and, I hope, truthfully...

776
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:31,333
and saw in myself
several things...

777
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:33,961
in, I think,
no particular order...

778
00:44:34,037 --> 00:44:37,837
and I would like
to share them with you.

779
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:41,742
That I would pursue it...

780
00:44:41,812 --> 00:44:43,837
that I desired it...

781
00:44:43,914 --> 00:44:46,849
that I was not pure of longing
for security...

782
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:50,284
and that perhaps
was not reprehensible in me.

783
00:44:50,353 --> 00:44:52,651
That I had duties
beyond the school...

784
00:44:52,722 --> 00:44:55,122
and that my duty to my home,
for instance...

785
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,989
was, or should be
if it were not...

786
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,687
of an equal weight.

787
00:44:58,762 --> 00:45:03,426
That tenure and security
and, yes, and comfort...

788
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,764
were not of themselves
to be scorned...

789
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:09,294
and were even worthy
of honorable pursuit.

790
00:45:09,372 --> 00:45:11,465
And that it was given me...

791
00:45:11,541 --> 00:45:14,066
here in this place
which I enjoy...

792
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:17,045
and in which I find comfort
to assure myself...

793
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:20,311
of, as far as it rests
in the material...

794
00:45:20,383 --> 00:45:23,819
a continuation
of that comfort and joy.

795
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,821
In exchange for what?

796
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,381
Teaching... which I love.

797
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:36,331
What was the price
of this security?

798
00:45:36,399 --> 00:45:39,334
To obtain tenure,
which tenure...

799
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:41,461
the committee is in the process
of granting me...

800
00:45:41,538 --> 00:45:42,937
and on the basis of which...

801
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:46,635
I contracted
to purchase a house.

802
00:45:49,412 --> 00:45:51,346
Now.

803
00:45:51,414 --> 00:45:54,383
As you don't have
your own family at this point...

804
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,351
you may not know
what that means...

805
00:45:56,419 --> 00:45:58,853
but to me,
it is very important...

806
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:02,790
a home, a good home,
to raise my family.

807
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,793
Now, the tenure committee
will meet.

808
00:46:04,861 --> 00:46:06,920
This is the process...

809
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:09,295
and a good process,
under which...

810
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:12,301
the school has functioned
for quite a long time.

811
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,304
They will meet
and hear your complaint...

812
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:17,306
which you have
the right to make...

813
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,274
and they will dismiss it.

814
00:46:19,342 --> 00:46:21,776
They will dismiss
your complaint...

815
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:23,779
and in
the intervening period...

816
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,645
I will lose my house.

817
00:46:26,716 --> 00:46:28,809
I will not be able
to close on my house.

818
00:46:28,885 --> 00:46:30,819
I will lose my deposit.

819
00:46:30,887 --> 00:46:34,823
And the home I picked out
for my wife and son...

820
00:46:34,891 --> 00:46:37,359
will go by the boards.

821
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:40,362
I see that I have angered you.

822
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,330
I understand
your anger with teachers.

823
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:44,333
I was angry with mine.

824
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:46,961
I felt hurt
and humiliated by them...

825
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:49,437
which is one of the reasons
I went into education.

826
00:46:49,506 --> 00:46:51,872
What do you want of me?

827
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,742
I was hurt when
I received the report...

828
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,211
of the tenure committee.

829
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,340
I was shocked and I was hurt.

830
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:02,783
Now...

831
00:47:02,852 --> 00:47:06,481
I don't mean to subject you
to my weak sensibilities.

832
00:47:06,556 --> 00:47:09,787
All right.
Finally, I did not understand.

833
00:47:09,859 --> 00:47:11,292
And then I thought...

834
00:47:11,361 --> 00:47:13,420
is it not always
at those points...

835
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,225
at which we reckon
ourselves unassailable...

836
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:17,698
that we are most vulnerable?

837
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:27,502
Yes. All right.

838
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:34,817
You find me pedantic.
Yes, I am.

839
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,376
By nature, by birth,
by profession.

840
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:41,083
I don't know. I'm always
looking for a paradigm.

841
00:47:41,157 --> 00:47:43,421
I don't know
what a paradigm is.

842
00:47:43,493 --> 00:47:44,653
It's a model.

843
00:47:44,728 --> 00:47:47,128
Then why can't you use
that word?

844
00:47:48,898 --> 00:47:51,833
If it is important to you, yes.

845
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:53,835
I was looking for a model.

846
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:57,361
To continue,
I feel that one point...

847
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,374
One second!

848
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,273
Upon which I am unassailable...

849
00:48:01,344 --> 00:48:05,041
is my unflinching concern
for my students' dignity.

850
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:08,312
I have asked you here
in a spirit of investigation...

851
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,286
to ask you... to ask...

852
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:14,221
what have I done to you?

853
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,022
And, I suppose,
how can I make amends?

854
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,255
Can we not settle this now?

855
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,628
It's pointless, really.
And I want to know...

856
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,792
What you can do
to force me to retract.

857
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:26,199
That is not what I meant at all.

858
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:29,136
To bribe me,
to convince me to retract.

859
00:48:29,205 --> 00:48:30,502
That is not what I meant at all.

860
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:32,097
I think you know that it is not.

861
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,938
That is not what I know.
I wish I...

862
00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:35,204
You wish what?

863
00:48:35,278 --> 00:48:37,303
No. You said
what amends you can make...

864
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:39,041
to force me to retract.

865
00:48:39,115 --> 00:48:40,309
That is not what I said.

866
00:48:40,383 --> 00:48:41,975
I have my notes.

867
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,078
Look. Look...

868
00:48:45,155 --> 00:48:46,816
The stoics say...

869
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,414
The stoics?

870
00:48:48,491 --> 00:48:50,083
The stoical philosophers say...

871
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,822
if you remove the phrase,
"I have been injured"...

872
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,864
you have removed the injury.

873
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,866
Now, think.
I know you're upset.

874
00:48:57,934 --> 00:49:00,767
Just tell me, literally...

875
00:49:00,837 --> 00:49:02,896
what wrong have I done you?

876
00:49:02,972 --> 00:49:05,270
Whatever you have done to me...

877
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:08,004
to the extent
that you've done it to me...

878
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:09,568
rather than
to me as a student...

879
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:11,511
and so to the student body...

880
00:49:11,581 --> 00:49:14,209
is contained in my report
to the tenure committee.

881
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,683
Well, all right.

882
00:49:17,554 --> 00:49:19,886
Let's see.

883
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:24,319
Let's investigate this.

884
00:49:27,864 --> 00:49:29,525
I find that I am sexist...

885
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,430
that I am elitist.

886
00:49:31,501 --> 00:49:32,968
I'm not sure
I know what that means...

887
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:36,699
other than it's
a derogatory word meaning bad.

888
00:49:36,773 --> 00:49:39,708
That I insist on wasting time...

889
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,802
in nonprescribed
and self-aggrandizing...

890
00:49:42,879 --> 00:49:46,872
and theatrical diversions
from the prescribed text.

891
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:51,319
That these have taken both
sexist and pornographic forms.

892
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:56,325
Here we find listed instances.

893
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:59,021
Closeted with a student...

894
00:49:59,095 --> 00:50:02,087
told a rambling,
sexually-explicit story...

895
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,326
in which the frequency
and attitudes of fornication...

896
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:09,429
of the poor and rich
are the central point.

897
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:12,839
"Moved to embrace said student."

898
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:16,868
That I used the phrase
"the white man's burden."

899
00:50:19,749 --> 00:50:22,047
That I told you
how I'd asked you to my room...

900
00:50:22,118 --> 00:50:24,177
because I "like you."

901
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:27,382
"He said he liked me,
that he liked being with me.

902
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,153
"He'd let me write
my examination paper over...

903
00:50:30,226 --> 00:50:33,821
"if I could come back oftener
to see him in his office."

904
00:50:33,897 --> 00:50:35,865
It's ludicrous.
Don't you know that?

905
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:37,365
It's not necessary.

906
00:50:37,434 --> 00:50:40,267
It's going to humiliate you
and to cost me my house.

907
00:50:40,336 --> 00:50:43,362
It's ludicrous?

908
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,000
"He told me he had problems
with his wife...

909
00:50:46,075 --> 00:50:47,269
"and that he wanted
to take off...

910
00:50:47,343 --> 00:50:49,675
"the artificial stricture
of teacher and student.

911
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,543
"He put his arms around..."

912
00:50:51,614 --> 00:50:53,047
Do you deny it?

913
00:50:53,116 --> 00:50:56,210
Can you deny it?
Don't you see?

914
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:57,412
You don't see, do you?

915
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:58,784
I don't see.

916
00:50:58,855 --> 00:51:01,619
You think that you can deny
that these things happened...

917
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:03,682
or if they did...

918
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:05,853
that they meant
what you said they meant.

919
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,988
Don't you see?
You dragged me in here...

920
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:11,932
You drag us to listen to you
go on about this or that...

921
00:51:12,001 --> 00:51:14,162
or we don't express
ourselves very well.

922
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,001
We don't say what we mean,
don't we?

923
00:51:17,073 --> 00:51:18,370
We do say what we mean...

924
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:20,306
and you say
"I don't understand you" and...

925
00:51:20,376 --> 00:51:22,241
Consult the report?
You see?

926
00:51:22,312 --> 00:51:23,711
Do you see what I'm saying?

927
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:25,771
Can't you tell me
in your own words?

928
00:51:25,849 --> 00:51:28,079
Those are my own words.

929
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,684
"He told me that if
I would stay alone with him...

930
00:51:32,755 --> 00:51:35,519
"in his office, he would
change my grade to an "A."

931
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,856
What have I done to you?

932
00:51:37,927 --> 00:51:40,293
Oh, my God!
Are you so hurt?

933
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:42,194
What I feel is irrelevant.

934
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,459
Do you know I tried to help you?

935
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:45,296
What I know I have reported.

936
00:51:45,368 --> 00:51:47,859
I would like to help you now,
before this escalates.

937
00:51:47,937 --> 00:51:49,234
I don't need your help.

938
00:51:49,305 --> 00:51:50,602
I don't need anything
that you have.

939
00:51:50,673 --> 00:51:53,870
- I feel...
- I don't care what you feel.

940
00:51:53,943 --> 00:51:56,741
You can't do that anymore.
You do not have the power.

941
00:51:56,813 --> 00:51:58,974
Did you misuse it?
Someone did.

942
00:51:59,048 --> 00:52:00,242
Are you part of that group?

943
00:52:00,316 --> 00:52:01,874
Yes, you are.
You've done these things.

944
00:52:01,951 --> 00:52:03,919
And to say, "Excuse me."

945
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:07,047
And to say, "Let me help
you with your problem..."

946
00:52:07,123 --> 00:52:09,318
Yes, I understand.

947
00:52:09,392 --> 00:52:11,223
You're hurt. You're angry.

948
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,319
I think your anger
is betraying you...

949
00:52:13,396 --> 00:52:15,830
down a path
which helps no one.

950
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:17,833
I don't care what you think.

951
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:20,927
You don't?
But you talk of rights.

952
00:52:21,004 --> 00:52:23,336
Don't you see?
I have rights, too.

953
00:52:23,406 --> 00:52:25,840
I have a house,
part of the real world...

954
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,174
and the tenure committee.
Good men and true.

955
00:52:29,245 --> 00:52:30,974
- Professor...
- Please.

956
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,982
Also part of that world.
You understand?

957
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,541
This is my life.
I'm not a boogie man.

958
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:37,916
I don't stand for something...

959
00:52:37,987 --> 00:52:40,854
Professor,
I came here as a favor...

960
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:42,357
at your personal request.

961
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,858
Perhaps I should not
have done so...

962
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:47,363
but I did on my behalf
and on behalf of my group.

963
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:48,988
And you speak of
the tenure committee...

964
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:51,158
one of whose members
is a woman...

965
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,031
and though you might
call it good fun...

966
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:55,832
or an historical phrase
or an oversight...

967
00:52:55,905 --> 00:52:59,272
to refer to the committee
as good men and true...

968
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,310
it is a demeaning remark.

969
00:53:01,377 --> 00:53:02,810
It is a sexist remark...

970
00:53:02,879 --> 00:53:05,814
and to overlook it is
to countenance continuation...

971
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:07,110
of that method of thought.

972
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:10,209
- It's a remark...
- Oh, come on!

973
00:53:10,286 --> 00:53:13,687
Come on! Sufficient
to deprive a family...

974
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:14,916
Sufficient?

975
00:53:14,991 --> 00:53:17,323
Sufficient, yes.
It is a fact.

976
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:19,327
And that story
which I quote...

977
00:53:19,395 --> 00:53:21,329
is vile and classist
and manipulative...

978
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:23,024
and pornographic...

979
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,464
It's pornographic?

980
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,196
What gives you the right
to speak to a woman...

981
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,305
Yes, I'm sorry.

982
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,843
I'm sorry
you feel yourself empowered.

983
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:36,378
You say so yourself...

984
00:53:36,446 --> 00:53:39,574
to strut, to posture,
to perform.

985
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:42,584
You say that higher education
is a joke...

986
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:44,347
and treat it as such.

987
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:47,048
You treat it as such
and confess to a taste...

988
00:53:47,123 --> 00:53:50,024
to play the patriarch
in your class...

989
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,357
to grant this, to deny that...

990
00:53:52,428 --> 00:53:53,895
to embrace your students.

991
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:56,864
How can you assert?
How can you stand there?

992
00:53:56,933 --> 00:54:01,165
How can you deny it?
You did it to me here.

993
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,670
You did. You confess.

994
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,172
You love the power...

995
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,800
to deviate, to invent,
to transgress...

996
00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:10,368
to transgress whatever norms
have been established for us.

997
00:54:10,446 --> 00:54:13,415
And you think it's charming
to question in yourself...

998
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,781
this taste to mock and destroy.

999
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:19,481
But to the aspirations
of your students...

1000
00:54:19,555 --> 00:54:22,388
of hard-working students
who come here...

1001
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:24,289
who slave to come here...

1002
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:29,821
You have no idea what it cost me
to come to this school.

1003
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:32,333
You mock us.

1004
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,870
You call education hazing...

1005
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:37,872
and from your so-protected,
so-elitist seat...

1006
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,602
you hold our confusion
as a joke...

1007
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,702
and our hopes and efforts
with it.

1008
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,906
Then you sit there and say,
"What have I done?"

1009
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:49,350
And ask me to understand
that you have aspirations, too.

1010
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:51,910
But I tell you...

1011
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:54,320
I tell you that you are vile...

1012
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:57,086
and that you are exploitative...

1013
00:54:57,160 --> 00:55:00,926
and if you possess one ounce
of that inner honesty...

1014
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:02,487
you describe in your book...

1015
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:07,002
you can look in yourself and
see those things that I see...

1016
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,562
and you can find revulsion
equal to my own. Good day.

1017
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,267
Wait a second, will you?
Just one moment.

1018
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:13,638
Nice day today.

1019
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:19,244
What?

1020
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:20,873
You said good day.

1021
00:55:20,950 --> 00:55:22,417
I think that it is
a nice day today.

1022
00:55:22,485 --> 00:55:24,510
- Is it?
- Yes, I think it is.

1023
00:55:24,587 --> 00:55:25,952
Why is that important?

1024
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,887
Because...

1025
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,393
it's the essence
of all human communication.

1026
00:55:31,461 --> 00:55:33,952
I say something conventional,
you respond...

1027
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,328
and the information we exchange
is not about the weather...

1028
00:55:36,399 --> 00:55:38,333
but that we agree to converse.

1029
00:55:38,401 --> 00:55:41,370
In effect, we agree
that we are both human.

1030
00:55:41,437 --> 00:55:43,234
I am not an exploiter...

1031
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:47,333
and you are not a deranged,
what, revolutionary?

1032
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,844
That we may have positions...

1033
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:52,346
and that we may have desires
which are in conflict...

1034
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:54,349
but that we're just human...

1035
00:55:54,417 --> 00:55:56,851
that means sometimes
we're imperfect.

1036
00:55:56,919 --> 00:55:59,217
Often, we're in conflict.

1037
00:55:59,288 --> 00:56:00,846
Much of what we do...
you're right...

1038
00:56:00,923 --> 00:56:03,858
in the name of principles
is self-serving.

1039
00:56:03,926 --> 00:56:05,894
Much of what we do
is conventional.

1040
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:07,452
You're right.

1041
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,967
You said you came into the class
to learn about education.

1042
00:56:12,034 --> 00:56:14,025
I don't know that
I can teach you about education.

1043
00:56:14,103 --> 00:56:17,368
But I know I can tell you
what I think about education...

1044
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,704
and then you decide.

1045
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,403
And you don't have
to fight with me.

1046
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:23,468
I'm not the subject.

1047
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:26,947
And where I am wrong...

1048
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:31,051
perhaps it's not your job
to fix me.

1049
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:32,781
I know I don't want to fix you.

1050
00:56:32,855 --> 00:56:34,584
I would like to tell you
what I think...

1051
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,818
because that is my job...

1052
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:40,795
conventional though it is,
and flawed as I may be.

1053
00:56:47,403 --> 00:56:48,961
And then...

1054
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:51,336
if you can show me
some better form...

1055
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:53,841
then we can proceed from there.

1056
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:57,073
But just like,
"Nice day, isn't it?"...

1057
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:59,341
I don't think we can proceed...

1058
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:03,112
until we accept
that each of us is human...

1059
00:57:03,186 --> 00:57:05,051
and we can
still have difficulties.

1060
00:57:05,121 --> 00:57:07,851
We will have them.
That's all right, too.

1061
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:09,391
- Now...
- Wait.

1062
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,294
Yes, I want to hear it.

1063
00:57:15,364 --> 00:57:16,626
The...

1064
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,564
Yes, tell me frankly.

1065
00:57:18,634 --> 00:57:19,794
My position...

1066
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:22,360
I want to hear it
in your own words...

1067
00:57:22,438 --> 00:57:23,803
what you want, what you feel...

1068
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:26,364
My group.

1069
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,103
Your group?

1070
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:39,013
The people
I've been talking to, they...

1071
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,022
There's no shame in that.

1072
00:57:41,090 --> 00:57:43,024
Everybody needs advisors.

1073
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,617
Everybody needs
to expose themselves...

1074
00:57:45,695 --> 00:57:46,821
to various points of view.

1075
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,332
It's not wrong.
It's essential.

1076
00:57:50,399 --> 00:57:51,866
Good.

1077
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:55,802
Good. Now.

1078
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:57,339
You and I...

1079
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,370
You and I.

1080
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:27,164
Hello?

1081
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:30,797
No. I know they do.

1082
00:58:30,873 --> 00:58:34,900
I know she does.
Tell her that I...

1083
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:36,808
Can I call you back?

1084
00:58:36,879 --> 00:58:40,815
No. Then tell her
I think it's going to be fine.

1085
00:58:40,883 --> 00:58:44,319
Tell her just hold on, and I...

1086
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,821
Can I get back to you?

1087
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:48,220
Well, no, no, no.

1088
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,919
We're taking the house.
No, no, no.

1089
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:54,827
It's not a question
of refunding the deposit.

1090
00:58:54,897 --> 00:58:58,060
Yes, I know the committee
is about to meet.

1091
00:58:58,134 --> 00:59:00,568
I'm dealing with the complaint.

1092
00:59:00,636 --> 00:59:04,834
Yes, right now.
Which is why I...

1093
00:59:04,907 --> 00:59:07,341
Call Jerry.
And I can't talk now.

1094
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:09,640
Fine. Good-bye.

1095
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:27,355
I'm sorry
that we were interrupted.

1096
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,694
- One moment.
- I was saying...

1097
00:59:29,765 --> 00:59:32,791
You said that we should agree
to talk about my complaint.

1098
00:59:32,868 --> 00:59:35,666
- That's correct.
- But we are talking about it.

1099
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,174
That's correct, too.
This is the gist of education...

1100
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:41,641
We're talking about it
at the tenure committee hearing.

1101
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:42,939
Yes, but I'm saying...

1102
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:44,809
We can talk about it
now as easily...

1103
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,472
No. I think we should
stick to the process...

1104
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,743
Wait a minute.

1105
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:50,581
The conventional process,
as you said.

1106
00:59:50,653 --> 00:59:55,022
And you're right.
I'm sorry if I was...

1107
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:57,082
If I was discourteous to you.
You're right.

1108
00:59:57,159 --> 01:00:00,128
- Wait a moment.
- I really should go.

1109
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,323
Granted, I have an interest
in the status quo.

1110
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,127
All right. Everybody does.

1111
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:06,430
But what I'm saying
is that the committee...

1112
01:00:06,502 --> 01:00:09,528
Professor, you're right.
Just don't impinge on me.

1113
01:00:09,605 --> 01:00:11,698
- We'll take our differences...
- Look, you're going...

1114
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,105
I shouldn't have come here.
They told me...

1115
01:00:13,175 --> 01:00:15,040
Wait one moment. No, no!

1116
01:00:15,111 --> 01:00:17,602
There are norms here.
And there's no reason...

1117
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,204
I'm trying to save you...

1118
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:21,841
You're trying to save me?
Do me the courtesy...

1119
01:00:21,917 --> 01:00:24,317
I am doing you the courtesy.
I'm talking straight to you.

1120
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,082
We can settle this now.

1121
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,680
- I want you to sit down.
- You must excuse me.

1122
01:00:28,758 --> 01:00:31,056
No, just sit down!

1123
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:35,188
It seems each of us...
Wait one moment.

1124
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:36,526
- Let me go!
- Just do me the courtesy!

1125
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,123
Let me go!
Get your hands off me!

1126
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,827
What are you getting
so excited about?

1127
01:00:39,902 --> 01:00:41,130
Will somebody help me please?

1128
01:00:41,203 --> 01:00:43,228
Will you please?

1129
01:00:43,305 --> 01:00:45,136
Would somebody help me,
please!

1130
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,771
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

1131
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,869
OK.

1132
01:02:09,725 --> 01:02:12,057
Excuse me.

1133
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,393
Can you make
a large-sized poster?

1134
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:16,415
I... I...

1135
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:19,256
I have asked you here...

1136
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:23,492
I have asked you here
against my...

1137
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:25,500
I was most surprised
you asked me here.

1138
01:03:25,568 --> 01:03:27,001
Against my better judgment.

1139
01:03:27,069 --> 01:03:31,130
- I was most surprised.
- Yes, I'm sure.

1140
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,074
If you would like me to leave,
I'll go right now.

1141
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:37,169
Let us begin correctly.
May we? I feel...

1142
01:03:37,246 --> 01:03:39,407
That is what I wish to do.
That's why I came here...

1143
01:03:39,481 --> 01:03:41,176
but now perhaps
you'd like me to leave.

1144
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:44,344
I don't want you to leave!
I asked you to come.

1145
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:46,388
I didn't have to come here.

1146
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,855
No.

1147
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:50,448
Thank you.

1148
01:03:58,434 --> 01:03:59,867
All right.

1149
01:04:01,437 --> 01:04:04,838
Although I feel it profits...

1150
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,534
that it would
profit you something...

1151
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,669
- What I...
- lf you would hear me out!

1152
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:11,042
I came here to.

1153
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,411
The court officers
told me not to come.

1154
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,643
- The court officers?
- I'm shocked that you asked.

1155
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:19,085
But I did not come here
to hear what it profits me.

1156
01:04:19,154 --> 01:04:21,850
- The court officers?
- Perhaps I should leave.

1157
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:25,052
- I shouldn't have...
- Wait! Wait a moment!

1158
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:26,560
Will you please?

1159
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:30,861
What is it you want?

1160
01:04:30,933 --> 01:04:32,491
I would like you to stay.

1161
01:04:32,568 --> 01:04:34,035
You want me to stay.

1162
01:04:34,103 --> 01:04:35,536
- Yes.
- You do.

1163
01:04:35,604 --> 01:04:38,266
I would like you to hear me out.
If you would.

1164
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:41,707
Would you? Please.

1165
01:04:41,777 --> 01:04:44,268
If you would do that,
I would be in your debt.

1166
01:04:47,716 --> 01:04:49,183
Thank you.

1167
01:04:51,920 --> 01:04:54,354
What is it
you wish to tell me?

1168
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,357
I cannot...

1169
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:59,622
I cannot help but feel
you are owed an apology.

1170
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:04,490
I have read and reread
these accusations...

1171
01:05:04,566 --> 01:05:05,965
What accusations?

1172
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:10,062
The tenure commit...
What other accusations?

1173
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:13,472
The tenure committee?
Those are not accusations.

1174
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:16,067
They have been proved.
They are facts.

1175
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:18,272
Those are not accusations.

1176
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:21,077
- Those?
- The committee has...

1177
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,017
Those are not accusations.
The tenure committee has...

1178
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,986
All right, all right!

1179
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:56,840
Hello. Yes.

1180
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:00,355
No, I'm here. Tell Mis...

1181
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:02,287
No, I have no time to...

1182
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,794
I'm sure he has,
but I'm fine.

1183
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:07,829
No, I have no time...

1184
01:06:07,896 --> 01:06:10,888
Tell Mis... Tell Mister...

1185
01:06:10,966 --> 01:06:15,835
Tell Jerry that I'm fine
and I'll call him right away.

1186
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:17,872
My wife. Yes.

1187
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:19,874
I'm sure she has. Yes.

1188
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,375
Thank you. Yes.

1189
01:06:21,443 --> 01:06:23,377
I'll call her, too.

1190
01:06:23,445 --> 01:06:25,743
I cannot talk to you now.

1191
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:44,832
All right.
It was good of you to come.

1192
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,334
Thank you.

1193
01:06:47,403 --> 01:06:49,337
I have studied...

1194
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:52,340
I have spent some time
studying the indictment.

1195
01:06:52,408 --> 01:06:55,070
You'll have to explain
that word to me.

1196
01:06:55,144 --> 01:06:57,339
- An indictment?
- Yes.

1197
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,244
Is a bill of particulars...

1198
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:01,509
- All right. Yes.
- In which is alleged...

1199
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:04,051
No. I cannot allow that.

1200
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:06,986
Nothing is alleged.
Everything is proved.

1201
01:07:07,055 --> 01:07:09,785
- Please, wait a second.
- I cannot allow that.

1202
01:07:09,858 --> 01:07:12,053
If I may? From whatever
you feel is established...

1203
01:07:12,127 --> 01:07:14,254
The issue here
is not what I feel.

1204
01:07:14,329 --> 01:07:15,694
It is not my feelings...

1205
01:07:15,764 --> 01:07:18,858
but the feelings of women
and men, your superiors...

1206
01:07:18,934 --> 01:07:20,526
who have been polled...

1207
01:07:20,602 --> 01:07:22,695
and have ruled
that you are negligent...

1208
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:26,036
that you are guilty and
are not to be given tenure...

1209
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,042
that you are to be disciplined.

1210
01:07:28,110 --> 01:07:30,544
That is what
the tenure committee has said.

1211
01:07:30,612 --> 01:07:34,378
That is what my lawyer said,
for what you did in class...

1212
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,315
for what you did in that office.

1213
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,819
They're going to discharge me.

1214
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,912
As full well they should!

1215
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:46,827
You don't understand. Fine.

1216
01:07:46,895 --> 01:07:48,658
What has led you to this point?

1217
01:07:48,730 --> 01:07:51,392
Not your sex, not your race,
not your class.

1218
01:07:51,467 --> 01:07:53,526
Your own actions.
And you're angry.

1219
01:07:53,602 --> 01:07:55,399
You ask me here.
What do you want?

1220
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:58,599
You want to charm me.
You want to convince me.

1221
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,837
You want me to recant.
I will not recant.

1222
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:03,343
Why should I?
What I say is right.

1223
01:08:03,412 --> 01:08:07,348
You were going to tell me that
you have a wife and child...

1224
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,350
that you have a career...

1225
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,353
and that you've worked
for 20 years for this.

1226
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,355
Do you know
what you've worked for?

1227
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,359
Power! For power.
Do you understand?

1228
01:08:18,427 --> 01:08:21,863
And you sit there and tell me
stories about your house...

1229
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:24,091
and all about private schools
and privilege...

1230
01:08:24,166 --> 01:08:27,863
and how you are entitled
to buy, to spend...

1231
01:08:27,936 --> 01:08:31,872
to mock, to summon.
All your stories.

1232
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:41,945
All your silly, weak guilt.

1233
01:08:42,017 --> 01:08:44,315
It's all about privilege...

1234
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:46,718
and you won't know it.
Don't you see?

1235
01:08:46,788 --> 01:08:49,621
You've worked twenty years
for the right to insult me.

1236
01:08:49,691 --> 01:08:53,127
And you feel entitled
to be paid for it.

1237
01:08:53,195 --> 01:08:54,628
Your home, your wife...

1238
01:08:54,696 --> 01:08:56,630
your sweet deposit
on your house.

1239
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,928
Don't you have feelings?

1240
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,196
That's my point, you see...

1241
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:03,033
"Don't you have feelings?"

1242
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:04,538
Your final argument...

1243
01:09:04,606 --> 01:09:07,803
I don't take your side,
you question if I'm human.

1244
01:09:07,876 --> 01:09:09,241
Don't you have feelings?

1245
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,744
I have a responsibility...

1246
01:09:10,812 --> 01:09:13,474
- To?
- This institution.

1247
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:15,380
To the students, to my group.

1248
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:16,940
- Your group?
- Yes.

1249
01:09:17,019 --> 01:09:21,046
Because I speak, not for myself,
but for the group.

1250
01:09:21,123 --> 01:09:23,318
For those who suffer
what I suffer...

1251
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:26,054
on behalf of whom,
even if I were inclined to...

1252
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:30,929
Forgive? Forget?
Overlook your...

1253
01:09:30,999 --> 01:09:33,934
- My behavior?
- It would be wrong.

1254
01:09:34,002 --> 01:09:35,629
Even if you were inclined
to forgive me?

1255
01:09:35,704 --> 01:09:38,172
- It would be wrong.
- And what would transpire?

1256
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:39,434
- Transpire?
- Yes.

1257
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:41,169
- Happen?
- Yes.

1258
01:09:41,243 --> 01:09:43,108
Then say it,
for Christ's sake!

1259
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:45,237
Who the hell
do you think that you are?

1260
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,612
You want a post...

1261
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:51,210
you want unlimited power
to do and say what you want...

1262
01:09:51,286 --> 01:09:53,914
as it pleases you...
testing, questioning...

1263
01:09:53,989 --> 01:09:55,422
- Flirting...
- I never...

1264
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,958
Excuse me one moment, will you?

1265
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:08,268
"The 12th.
Have a good day, dear."

1266
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,765
"The 15th.
Now, don't you look fetching."

1267
01:10:12,841 --> 01:10:16,777
"April 17th. If you girls
would come over here..."

1268
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:19,313
I saw you.

1269
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:22,475
I saw you, Professor,
for the entire semester...

1270
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,143
sit there, stand there...

1271
01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:27,484
and exploit
your paternal prerogative.

1272
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,616
And what is that but rape,
I swear to God?

1273
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:35,763
You asked me in here
to explain something to me...

1274
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,765
that I did not understand...

1275
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:40,427
but I came here to explain
something to you.

1276
01:10:40,502 --> 01:10:42,436
You are not God.

1277
01:10:42,504 --> 01:10:44,938
You ask me why I came?

1278
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,975
I came here to instruct you.

1279
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:51,036
And your book.

1280
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:53,946
You want to talk about
your book?

1281
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:56,985
You think you're going
to show me some light?

1282
01:10:58,186 --> 01:11:00,916
You maverick,
outside of tradition.

1283
01:11:00,989 --> 01:11:02,217
No, no...

1284
01:11:02,290 --> 01:11:05,555
of that fine tradition
of inquiry...

1285
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:07,720
of polite skepticism.

1286
01:11:07,796 --> 01:11:12,165
And you say you believe in
free intellectual discourse?

1287
01:11:12,234 --> 01:11:14,134
You believe in nothing.

1288
01:11:14,202 --> 01:11:16,295
You believe in nothing at all.

1289
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:18,805
I believe in freedom of thought.

1290
01:11:18,874 --> 01:11:20,569
Isn't that fine? Do you?

1291
01:11:20,642 --> 01:11:21,802
Yes, I do.

1292
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:23,742
Then why do you question
for one moment...

1293
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:26,337
the committee's decision
refusing your tenure?

1294
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:28,849
Why do you question
your suspension?

1295
01:11:28,917 --> 01:11:31,977
You believe in what
you call freedom of thought...

1296
01:11:32,054 --> 01:11:33,248
then fine.

1297
01:11:33,321 --> 01:11:36,449
You believe in freedom
of thought and a home...

1298
01:11:36,525 --> 01:11:39,756
and prerogatives
for your kid and tenure.

1299
01:11:39,828 --> 01:11:41,056
And I'm going to tell you...

1300
01:11:41,129 --> 01:11:43,290
that you believe not
in freedom of thought...

1301
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,798
but in an elitist...

1302
01:11:44,866 --> 01:11:48,302
in a protected hierarchy
which rewards you.

1303
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:52,272
And for whom you are the clown.

1304
01:11:52,340 --> 01:11:56,936
You mock and exploit the system
which pays your rent.

1305
01:11:57,012 --> 01:11:58,502
You're wrong.

1306
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,047
I'm not wrong.

1307
01:12:01,683 --> 01:12:03,150
You're wrong.

1308
01:12:11,059 --> 01:12:13,653
You think
that I'm full of hatred.

1309
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:16,095
I know what you think I am.

1310
01:12:16,164 --> 01:12:17,290
Do you?

1311
01:12:17,365 --> 01:12:19,799
Of course I do.

1312
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:23,634
You think I'm a frightened,
repressed, confused...

1313
01:12:23,705 --> 01:12:27,300
abandoned young thing of
some doubtful sexuality...

1314
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:30,276
who wants power and revenge,
don't you?

1315
01:12:31,813 --> 01:12:33,713
Yes, I do.

1316
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:37,751
Isn't that better?

1317
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:40,754
And I feel that
that is the first moment...

1318
01:12:40,822 --> 01:12:43,518
which you've treated me
with respect.

1319
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:46,026
For you told me the truth.

1320
01:12:46,094 --> 01:12:49,996
I did not come here,
as you are assured, to gloat.

1321
01:12:50,065 --> 01:12:51,327
Why would I want to gloat?

1322
01:12:51,399 --> 01:12:55,028
I've profited nothing from,
as you say, your misfortune.

1323
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:57,162
I came here...

1324
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:01,198
as you did me the honor
to ask me here.

1325
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:03,710
I came here
to tell you something...

1326
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,441
If I may...

1327
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:07,982
that I think...

1328
01:13:09,518 --> 01:13:11,952
that I think you've been wrong.

1329
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:15,285
That I think
you've been terribly wrong.

1330
01:13:15,357 --> 01:13:17,484
Do you hate me now?

1331
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:20,892
- Yes.
- Listen to me, Professor.

1332
01:13:20,962 --> 01:13:23,396
It is the power
that you hate so deeply...

1333
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:26,764
that any atmosphere of
free discussion is impossible.

1334
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:29,770
It's not unlikely.
It's impossible, isn't it?

1335
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:32,932
- Isn't it?
- Yes, I suppose.

1336
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,942
Now the thing
which you find so cruel...

1337
01:13:35,010 --> 01:13:37,205
is the self-same process
of selection...

1338
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,147
that I and my group go through
every day of our lives...

1339
01:13:41,216 --> 01:13:42,342
in admittance to school...

1340
01:13:42,417 --> 01:13:44,612
in our tests,
in our class rankings.

1341
01:13:48,390 --> 01:13:51,325
You write that education
is just hazing.

1342
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:54,362
But we work
to get to this school...

1343
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:56,124
and some of us
overcame prejudices...

1344
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:59,634
economic, sexual...
you cannot begin to imagine...

1345
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:03,501
and endured humiliations that
I pray you and those you love...

1346
01:14:03,572 --> 01:14:06,871
never will encounter
to gain admittance here...

1347
01:14:06,942 --> 01:14:11,174
to pursue that same dream
of security you pursue...

1348
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:12,372
we, who are at any moment...

1349
01:14:12,447 --> 01:14:15,382
in danger of
being deprived of it.

1350
01:14:15,450 --> 01:14:16,576
By?

1351
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:19,381
By the administration,
by the teachers, by you.

1352
01:14:19,454 --> 01:14:23,550
By one low grade that keeps us
out of graduate school.

1353
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:26,822
By one capricious or
inventive answer on our parts...

1354
01:14:26,895 --> 01:14:29,159
which perhaps
you don't find amusing.

1355
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,723
I don't understand!

1356
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,361
My charges are not trivial.

1357
01:14:35,437 --> 01:14:38,736
You see that in the haste
with which they were accepted.

1358
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:41,002
A joke you have told
with a sexist tinge.

1359
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:43,237
The language you use.

1360
01:14:43,311 --> 01:14:46,178
A verbal or physical caress.
Yes, I know.

1361
01:14:46,248 --> 01:14:48,512
You say it's meaningless.
I understand.

1362
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:50,312
I differ from you.

1363
01:14:50,385 --> 01:14:52,353
To lay a hand
on someone's shoulder...

1364
01:14:52,420 --> 01:14:54,547
It was devoid
of sexual content...

1365
01:14:54,623 --> 01:14:58,218
I say it was not!

1366
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:00,727
Don't you begin to see,
to understand...

1367
01:15:00,795 --> 01:15:03,593
that it is not for you to say.

1368
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:05,098
I take your point.

1369
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:08,101
I see there is much good
in what you refer to.

1370
01:15:08,169 --> 01:15:09,431
Do you think so?

1371
01:15:09,504 --> 01:15:12,940
But, not to say that I cannot
change in those things...

1372
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:14,600
where I am deficient, but...

1373
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,109
Do you hold yourself harmless...

1374
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,838
from the charge of
sexual exploitativeness?

1375
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:20,746
I have to tell you...

1376
01:15:20,815 --> 01:15:24,751
as I said, I think
I am not too old to learn.

1377
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:26,252
And I can learn.

1378
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:27,754
Do you hold yourself innocent?

1379
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:30,450
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's go back...

1380
01:15:30,525 --> 01:15:31,856
No! You fool!

1381
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:35,021
Who do you think I am,
to be taken in by a smile?

1382
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:38,361
You little yapping fool.
You think I want revenge?

1383
01:15:38,433 --> 01:15:41,834
I don't want revenge.
I want understanding.

1384
01:15:41,903 --> 01:15:43,894
- Do you?
- I do.

1385
01:15:45,874 --> 01:15:48,502
What's the use? It's over.

1386
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:54,779
Is it? What is?

1387
01:15:56,217 --> 01:15:57,377
My job.

1388
01:16:00,522 --> 01:16:03,320
Your job.

1389
01:16:03,391 --> 01:16:06,360
That's what
you want to talk about.

1390
01:16:34,189 --> 01:16:36,623
All right.
What if it were possible...

1391
01:16:36,691 --> 01:16:38,784
my group withdraws
its complaint?

1392
01:16:38,860 --> 01:16:40,828
- What?
- That's right.

1393
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:43,958
Why?

1394
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:46,557
Let's say,
as an act of friendship.

1395
01:16:46,634 --> 01:16:48,295
- An act of friendship?
- Yes.

1396
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:49,735
In exchange for what?

1397
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:51,567
Yes, but I don't think
an exchange...

1398
01:16:51,639 --> 01:16:54,073
for what do we derive from it?

1399
01:16:54,142 --> 01:16:55,268
- Derive?
- Yes.

1400
01:16:55,343 --> 01:16:56,640
- Nothing.
- That's right.

1401
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:58,303
We derive nothing.
Do you see that?

1402
01:16:58,380 --> 01:17:00,678
- Yes.
- That's a little word.

1403
01:17:00,749 --> 01:17:02,842
"Yes-I-see-that,"
but you will.

1404
01:17:05,553 --> 01:17:07,987
You might speak
to the committee?

1405
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,489
To the committee?

1406
01:17:09,557 --> 01:17:11,422
Yes.

1407
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:14,223
Of course that's on your mind,
we might.

1408
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:15,455
If what?

1409
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:18,192
Given what?
That is more friendly.

1410
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,631
Given what?

1411
01:17:19,701 --> 01:17:23,102
And, believe me,
I understand your rage.

1412
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,365
It's not that
I don't feel it...

1413
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:25,997
but I do not see
that it is deserved...

1414
01:17:26,074 --> 01:17:29,066
so I do not resent it.

1415
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:30,839
All right. I have a list.

1416
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:32,345
A list.

1417
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:36,248
Here is a list of books
which we find questionable.

1418
01:17:39,521 --> 01:17:40,818
What?

1419
01:17:40,889 --> 01:17:43,153
- Is this so bizarre?
- I can't believe...

1420
01:17:43,224 --> 01:17:45,158
It's not necessary
you believe it.

1421
01:17:45,226 --> 01:17:47,990
- Academic freedom...
- Someone chooses the books.

1422
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,724
If you can choose them,
others can.

1423
01:17:49,798 --> 01:17:52,494
- What are you, God?
- No. The dangerous...

1424
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:54,967
You have an agenda.
We have an agenda.

1425
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:56,833
I'm not interested
in your feelings...

1426
01:17:56,905 --> 01:17:58,964
or your motivation,
but your actions.

1427
01:17:59,040 --> 01:18:01,508
If you would like me to speak
to the tenure committee...

1428
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:02,838
here is my list.

1429
01:18:02,911 --> 01:18:05,573
You are a free person.
You decide.

1430
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:13,614
I think you'll find...

1431
01:18:13,688 --> 01:18:16,156
I'm capable of reading it,
thank you.

1432
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,055
We have a number of texts
we need reviewed.

1433
01:18:18,126 --> 01:18:19,457
I see that.

1434
01:18:19,527 --> 01:18:21,392
We're amenable
to anything that...

1435
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:23,761
- Let me look over...
- I think you should...

1436
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:27,324
I'm reading your demands,
all right?

1437
01:18:42,350 --> 01:18:44,284
You want to ban my book.

1438
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,286
- We do not.
- It says here...

1439
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:47,651
We want it
removed from inclusion...

1440
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:50,350
as a representative example
of the university.

1441
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:51,551
Get out of here.

1442
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:52,923
If you put aside
the issue of personality...

1443
01:18:52,994 --> 01:18:55,053
Get the fuck out of my office!

1444
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,427
I would reconsider.

1445
01:18:56,498 --> 01:18:59,023
- You think that you can...
- We can, and we will.

1446
01:18:59,100 --> 01:19:01,625
Do you want our support?
That is the only question.

1447
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:03,102
- To ban my book?
- That is correct.

1448
01:19:03,171 --> 01:19:06,629
- This is a university.
- And we have a statement.

1449
01:19:06,708 --> 01:19:07,834
We have a statement.

1450
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:11,436
No! It's out of the question!

1451
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:13,378
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1452
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:14,881
I don't know
what was I thinking of.

1453
01:19:14,949 --> 01:19:16,211
I'll tell you something.

1454
01:19:16,284 --> 01:19:18,878
I'm a teacher.

1455
01:19:18,953 --> 01:19:20,921
It's my name on the door...

1456
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,889
and I teach the class.
That's what I do.

1457
01:19:22,957 --> 01:19:25,255
I have a book
with my name on it...

1458
01:19:25,326 --> 01:19:28,386
and my son will see
that book someday.

1459
01:19:28,463 --> 01:19:30,294
And I have a respons...

1460
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:35,132
No. I'm sorry.
I have a responsibility...

1461
01:19:35,203 --> 01:19:38,570
to myself, to my son,
to my profession.

1462
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,766
I haven't been home
for two days.

1463
01:19:39,841 --> 01:19:42,105
You know that?
Thinking this out.

1464
01:19:42,177 --> 01:19:43,542
You haven't?

1465
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:47,308
If it's of interest you,
I've been in a hotel thinking.

1466
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,316
You haven't been home.

1467
01:19:49,384 --> 01:19:50,942
Thinking, you see?

1468
01:19:51,019 --> 01:19:54,318
And I owe you a debt.
I see that now.

1469
01:19:54,389 --> 01:19:55,617
You're dangerous.

1470
01:19:55,690 --> 01:19:59,057
You're wrong and it is my job
to say no to you.

1471
01:19:59,127 --> 01:20:01,322
And that is my job.
That's right.

1472
01:20:01,396 --> 01:20:02,863
You're absolutely right.

1473
01:20:02,931 --> 01:20:04,455
You want to ban my book?

1474
01:20:04,532 --> 01:20:06,966
You can go to hell.

1475
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,663
And they can do to me
whatever they want.

1476
01:20:09,737 --> 01:20:11,864
You haven't been home
in two days.

1477
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:13,464
I think I told you that.

1478
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:16,635
You better get that phone.

1479
01:20:23,618 --> 01:20:25,609
I think that
you should pick up the phone.

1480
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:37,264
Yes.

1481
01:20:37,332 --> 01:20:39,766
Yes.

1482
01:20:39,834 --> 01:20:44,464
Well, I had to be...
Did you worry about me?

1483
01:20:45,673 --> 01:20:48,107
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine, Jerry.

1484
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:50,872
I got a little bit mixed up...

1485
01:20:50,945 --> 01:20:53,812
but I'm sitting here
and I got it figured out.

1486
01:20:53,881 --> 01:20:55,781
I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

1487
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:58,410
I got a little bit
turned around...

1488
01:20:58,486 --> 01:20:59,919
but I'm sitting here...

1489
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,923
and I'm not sure
it's not a blessing.

1490
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:04,583
Cost me my job, fine.

1491
01:21:04,659 --> 01:21:06,388
Then the job
was not worth having.

1492
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:08,929
Tell Grace I'm coming home.
Everything's fine.

1493
01:21:11,766 --> 01:21:14,735
What? What do you mean?

1494
01:21:17,272 --> 01:21:19,069
Jerry...

1495
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:22,439
Jerry, they... Who? Who?

1496
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:24,637
What can they do?

1497
01:21:27,548 --> 01:21:29,175
They can't do that.

1498
01:21:30,818 --> 01:21:32,149
But how?

1499
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:36,851
She's... She's here with me.

1500
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,127
Jerry...

1501
01:21:42,997 --> 01:21:44,965
Jerry, I don't underst...

1502
01:21:47,168 --> 01:21:49,227
What does this mean?

1503
01:21:51,673 --> 01:21:53,163
I thought you knew.

1504
01:21:53,241 --> 01:21:56,039
What? What does it mean?

1505
01:21:59,681 --> 01:22:02,115
You tried to rape me.

1506
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:04,208
According to the law.

1507
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:07,514
What?

1508
01:22:07,588 --> 01:22:09,920
You tried to rape me.

1509
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:12,824
I was leaving this office.
You pressed yourself into me.

1510
01:22:12,894 --> 01:22:14,828
You pressed your body into me.

1511
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:19,196
My group has told your lawyer
we may pursue criminal charges.

1512
01:22:19,267 --> 01:22:21,735
Under the statute,
I'm told, it was battery.

1513
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:22,997
No.

1514
01:22:23,071 --> 01:22:25,266
Yes. And attempted rape.
That's right.

1515
01:22:34,982 --> 01:22:36,449
Get out.

1516
01:22:39,153 --> 01:22:41,553
Of course, I thought you knew.

1517
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:45,653
I have to talk to my lawyer.

1518
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:50,093
Yes, perhaps you should.

1519
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:01,934
Hello. I...

1520
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:05,069
Hello. I...

1521
01:23:05,146 --> 01:23:06,807
Yes, he just called.

1522
01:23:09,016 --> 01:23:11,883
I can't talk now, baby.

1523
01:23:14,355 --> 01:23:16,653
- Get out.
- Your wife?

1524
01:23:16,724 --> 01:23:18,351
Who it is
is no concern of yours.

1525
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:19,791
Get out.

1526
01:23:22,463 --> 01:23:24,294
I can't talk now, baby.

1527
01:23:25,366 --> 01:23:30,201
No, no, no.
It's going to be fine.

1528
01:23:31,539 --> 01:23:33,006
Get out of here!

1529
01:23:33,074 --> 01:23:35,008
- I'm going.
- Good.

1530
01:23:35,076 --> 01:23:37,203
And don't call your wife "baby."

1531
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:40,374
What?

1532
01:23:40,448 --> 01:23:43,884
Don't call your wife "baby."
You heard what I said.

1533
01:23:43,951 --> 01:23:46,078
You find that amusing?

1534
01:23:51,125 --> 01:23:53,650
No!

1535
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,787
You vicious little bitch!

1536
01:23:55,863 --> 01:23:57,694
Come here. Come here.

1537
01:23:59,400 --> 01:24:00,697
Get...

1538
01:24:05,339 --> 01:24:07,273
- Come here!
- No!

1539
01:24:07,341 --> 01:24:10,833
You think that you can...

1540
01:24:10,912 --> 01:24:13,779
destroy my life
after how I've treated you!

1541
01:24:13,848 --> 01:24:15,543
Are you kidding me?

1542
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:21,188
Yes? Yes?

1543
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:25,222
Come here!

1544
01:24:30,998 --> 01:24:32,465
Rape you?

1545
01:24:39,674 --> 01:24:42,142
Rape you?
Are you kidding me?

1546
01:24:43,244 --> 01:24:46,702
I wouldn't touch you
with a 10-foot...

1547
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:52,319
- You little cunt!
- Don't! Don't!

1548
01:25:21,916 --> 01:25:23,543
Oh, my God.

1549
01:25:43,871 --> 01:25:45,668
Oh, my God.

1550
01:25:48,309 --> 01:25:50,277
Yes, that's right.
