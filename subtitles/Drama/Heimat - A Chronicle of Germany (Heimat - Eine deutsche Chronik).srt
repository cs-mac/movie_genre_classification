THE WHITE RIBBON
A German children's story

2
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,000
<i>I don't know if the story
I want to tell you

3
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:46,200
<i>is entirely true. 

4
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,600
<i>Some of it I only know by hearsay. 

5
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:54,100
<i>After so many years,
a lot of it is still obscure,

6
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,300
<i>and many questions
remain unanswered. 

7
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,600
<i>But I think I must tell
of the strange events

8
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,600
<i>that occurred in our village. 

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>They could perhaps

10
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,100
<i>clarify some things
that happened in this country. 

11
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,900
<i>It all began, I think,
with the doctor's riding accident. 

12
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:20,100
<i>After his dressage session
on the Baron's estate,

13
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,700
<i>he was headed home,

14
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
<i>to see if any patients had arrived. 

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,700
<i>Entering the garden,

16
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,900
<i>his horse tripped on a wire

17
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,900
<i>strung between two trees. 

18
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:40,400
<i>His daughter saw the accident
from a window,

19
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,100
<i>informed their neighbor,

20
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,300
<i>who informed the estate's steward,

21
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,000
<i>so that the agonizing doctor

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,200
<i>could be transported
to the district hospital

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,700
<i>over 30 km away. 

24
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,600
<i>The neighbor,
a single woman of around 40,

25
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,200
<i>was the village midwife. 

26
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,600
<i>Since the death of the doctor's wife
in childbirth,

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>she had become invaluable for him
as housekeeper and receptionist. 

28
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,800
<i>After tending the doctor's
two children,

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
<i>she went to the school
to fetch her own son, Karl. 

30
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,100
- Have you seen Anni?
- You don't say hello?

31
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,200
Hello, Mrs Wagner. Forgive him.

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,500
Hi, Klara.

33
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,700
We're so worried
that Martin forgot his manners.

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,100
That's all right.

35
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,600
How is the Doctor?

36
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:29,900
Not very well.

37
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,200
- Must he stay in the hospital?
- I don't know.

38
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,700
We'll go see Anna, to help her out.

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,900
Good!

40
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,600
- You enjoyed the choir?
- Yes.

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,700
Show how well you sang.

42
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,100
Good bye, teacher.

43
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,700
Last one is a rotten egg!

44
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,400
<i>If I remember correctly,

45
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,600
<i>it seemed odd to me
that the kids around Klara,

46
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,700
<i>instead of scattering
after school to their homes,

47
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,500
<i>headed together
to the exit of the village. 

48
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,900
I could cut out some animals
for you...

49
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,200
...like last week.

50
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,200
You'd like that?

51
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
We can color them together.

52
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Or cut them
from the lovely colored paper?

53
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,700
The golden one
that I got for Easter?

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,900
Come on...

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,400
Well, I'll make us something to eat.

56
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,800
What if he never comes back?

57
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
What?

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,400
Come on!

59
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't be silly!

60
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,800
It'll heal, just like the flu.

61
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,500
Remember last winter?

62
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,300
You were very sick, weren't you?

63
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,600
And then...

64
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,300
Hi, Anni!

65
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,700
How are you?

66
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,500
Can we help you?

67
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
How did the wire get there?
Did the Doctor say?

68
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,800
He was in no mood to talk:

69
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,200
...his collarbone
was stuck in his neck.

70
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,800
I asked his daughter.
She has no idea.

71
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,700
He rides through there daily.

72
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,500
- Did you look at the wire?
- Sure.

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
It's thin, but strong.

74
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,000
Almost invisible.

75
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,800
Sorry, Madame.
You play too well for me.

76
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,700
Don't apologize, concentrate.
It'll help us both.

77
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,200
You play too fast for me, M'am.
I'm not Frederic the Great.

78
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
How could he have played Schubert?

79
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,600
Let's do the Variation again.

80
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,500
Darling, if you like the music,
sit beside me and turn the pages.

81
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,200
If you're bored, go to your room.

82
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,100
Or stay out of my sight.

83
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,200
I get nervous if you saunter around.

84
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,600
What time is it?
Where's the nanny?

85
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,300
With the twins, I presume.

86
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
- It's twenty to nine.
- Twenty to nine?

87
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,700
Way past your bedtime!

88
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,600
Has he done his homework?

89
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,100
Of course, M'am.

90
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,300
You want to turn the pages for me or not?

91
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,700
Yes.

92
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,500
Then come here!

93
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,500
Let's go back to the Theme.

94
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:35,000
Practice the Variations.
Or it's no fun.

95
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,800
I'll do my best, Baroness.

96
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,600
So from Bar 9.

97
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,200
Please forgive us, Father.

98
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,700
Forgive us.

99
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,800
Tonight, no one here has eaten.

100
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,000
When night fell,
and you hadn't returned...

101
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
...your mother searched the village
in tears.

102
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,800
Could we have enjoyed our meal,
fearing for you?

103
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,100
Can we enjoy our meal now...

104
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,900
...after hearing your lying excuses?

105
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,600
I don't know what's worse:

106
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,000
...your absence, or your coming back.

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,000
Tonight we'll all go to bed hungry.

108
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,600
You surely agree with me.

109
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,400
...that I can't leave
your offense unpunished.

110
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,100
...if we want to keep on living
in mutual respect.

111
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,900
So tomorrow evening at this hour...

112
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,800
I'll give each of you,
in front of your siblings...

113
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
...ten strokes of the cane.

114
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:11,600
Until then,
you may ponder over your offense.

115
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,300
Do you agree with me?

116
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,200
Yes, Father.

117
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,300
All right then.
Go to bed now, all of you.

118
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,100
Don't touch me!

119
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
Your mother and I will sleep poorly:

120
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,700
I have to beat you and the strokes
will cause us more pain than you.

121
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,900
Leave us alone, and go to bed!

122
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,400
When you were little...

123
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,800
...your mother sometimes tied a ribbon.

124
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,900
...in your hair or around your arm.

125
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,200
Its white color was to remind you
of innocence and purity.

126
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:24,000
I thought you were now
well-mannered enough.

127
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,700
...to get by without such reminders.

128
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,300
I was wrong.

129
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,900
Tomorrow, once your punishment
has purified you...

130
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,400
...your mother
will re-tie a ribbon on you...

131
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,400
...and you'll wear it.

132
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:45,800
...until we can trust you again.

133
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,500
Where is the wire now?

134
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,900
Who removed it?

135
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,100
I don't know.

136
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,600
You weren't here?

137
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,600
You were in town with your father?

138
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,700
No.

139
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,200
- Then you were here.
- I was at school.

140
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,800
When you left,
was the wire still here?

141
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,300
I didn't check.

142
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,700
- When did you get back?
- At noon.

143
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,900
I make lunch for the Doctor
and the kids.

144
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,600
I've helped him since his wife died.

145
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,900
Since when?

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,700
Since Rudolf's birth, 5 years ago.

147
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm the midwife here.
We work together.

148
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
- But you saw nothing?
- No.

149
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,100
How long was the wire there?

150
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,600
I never saw it.

151
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,600
Nobody saw it before, or afterwards!

152
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,700
It wound itself around two trees,
and vanished by itself!

153
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,100
Right?

154
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,300
Mom!

155
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,800
What is it?

156
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,200
Excuse me.

157
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,700
<i>The day after the doctor's accident

158
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,300
<i>brought no solution to the mystery. 

159
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,800
<i>Then a second,
far more tragic incident,

160
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,500
<i>almost made people forget
the previous one. 

161
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,900
<i>The wife of a tenant farmer
died in a work-accident. 

162
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,700
<i>The woman, who had an injured arm,

163
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:19,000
<i>was dispensed by the steward
from harvesting chores,

164
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,300
<i>and assigned to lighter work
in the sawmill. 

165
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,500
Stay outside! I'm not done.

166
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,500
You get out!

167
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,500
<i>On the same day,
I had a strange encounter. 

168
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,400
<i>The weather was beautiful and hot,

169
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,500
<i>so I decided to improve my meager
menu with some brown trout,

170
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,500
<i>which are plentiful in the river. 

171
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,000
<i>The Baron allowed me to fish there. 

172
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,300
Martin!

173
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,200
Martin, be careful!

174
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,800
Are you insane?

175
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
You want to break your neck?

176
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,800
Hello, sir.

177
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:00,600
What's this?
Have you gone mad?

178
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You know how high that is?

179
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,500
Didn't you hear me shout to you?

180
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,900
Yes, I did.

181
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,200
Well?

182
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,200
Well?

183
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,900
You saw me and wanted to impress me?

184
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,600
So why...

185
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,400
I gave God a chance to kill me.

186
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,100
He didn't do it.
So he's pleased with me.

187
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,700
What are you saying?

188
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
He doesn't want me to die.

189
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,200
Who doesn't want you to die?

190
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,200
God.

191
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,500
Why would God want you to die?

192
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Promise me you won't do it again!

193
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,100
Look at me!

194
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,400
Promise it!

195
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,600
You don't trust me, huh?

196
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,300
Yes, I do, sir.

197
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,100
All right.

198
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,500
Go home. Tomorrow after your
piano lesson, I'll talk to your dad.

199
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,400
No, please, don't tell him!

200
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,200
It's there.

201
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,000
Careful, it's all rotten.

202
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,200
Who sent her up here?

203
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,700
No idea.

204
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,500
We had to collect loose ends.
She fell through.

205
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,500
You saw it?

206
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,900
Not really.

207
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,800
You know how it works.

208
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,000
The foremen assign
weaker harvesters up here.

209
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,600
Who assigned her?

210
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,300
<i>On my way home, after
that strange encounter with Martin,

211
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,900
<i>was when I first met Eva... 

212
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,800
Hello!

213
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,700
Excuse me!

214
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
Sorry for accosting you.

215
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,800
Aren't you the new nanny
on the estate?

216
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,000
Why?

217
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,400
They say you're from Treglitz.

218
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,600
Who says that?

219
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,200
The locals.

220
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
So?

221
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,300
Nothing...

222
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,100
I don't know...

223
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,300
I'm the schoolteacher here.

224
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,200
I just thought...

225
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
When I saw you, I thought...

226
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,800
I'm the tailor's son from Vasendorf.

227
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,300
- I know.
- What?

228
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,000
The Baroness told me.

229
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,400
What?

230
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,400
That the teacher is
from the village next to mine.

231
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,700
I see, yes...

232
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,800
Well... I thought...

233
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,100
Looks as if you're going there...

234
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,900
Where?

235
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,300
Back home. To Treglitz.

236
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,300
Yes?

237
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,900
- Are you going there?
- Yes, I am.

238
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,000
I thought...

239
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,300
...since you'll go through our village,
you could...

240
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,400
...say hello to my dad,
and give him a fish?

241
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,000
What?

242
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,000
He'd love that.

243
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,800
Especially over the weekend.

244
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,300
How?...

245
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,900
I don't know.

246
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,200
Unfortunately,
I have nothing to wrap...

247
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,000
Neither do I.

248
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Unfortunately...

249
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
We could tie them on
with fishing line.

250
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,000
Just like that, on the bike?

251
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,300
That's not a very good idea.

252
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,700
Right, it was just an idea.

253
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,200
Yes.

254
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,900
Is it your bike?

255
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,800
No, the estate's.

256
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,700
Is this your first day off?

257
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
You must be glad to go home.

258
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,600
I can imagine.

259
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,700
Well... I've still a long way to go.

260
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,000
Well...

261
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,400
Good-bye.

262
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,400
Good-bye.

263
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,800
If you see my father in Vasendorf...

264
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,900
...say hello to him from me.

265
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,000
I don't know your father.

266
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,600
That's true.

267
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
It's my first time on a bike!

268
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,500
You're doing fine!

269
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,200
But be careful!

270
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,400
The woman today,
what was wrong with her?

271
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,600
Which woman?

272
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,600
I see. She was dead.

273
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,900
What's that?

274
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,100
What?

275
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,600
Dead.

276
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,200
What's "dead"?

277
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,100
Quite a question!

278
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,100
It's when one doesn't live anymore.

279
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,000
When one has stopped living.

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,600
When does one stop living?

281
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,700
When one is very old, or very ill.

282
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,300
And the woman?

283
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,200
She had an accident.

284
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,100
An "accident"?

285
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,200
Yes. It's when you're badly hurt.

286
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,900
Like Dad?

287
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,100
Yes, but much worse than that.

288
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,200
So bad,
your body can't take it anymore.

289
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,500
And then you're dead?

290
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,800
Yes.

291
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,000
But most people
don't have an accident.

292
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,100
- So they're not dead.
- No, they die much later.

293
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,600
When?

294
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,200
Well... Later,
when they're really old.

295
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,000
Does everyone die?

296
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,200
Yes.

297
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,600
Everyone, really?

298
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,400
Yes, everyone has to die.

299
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,100
But not you, Anni?

300
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,700
Me too.

301
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,000
Everyone.

302
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,300
But not Dad?

303
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,400
Dad too.

304
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,600
Me too?

305
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,900
You too.
But not for a very long time.

306
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,000
All of us, only in a very long time.

307
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,100
One can't fight it?
It has to happen?

308
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,600
Yes, but not for a very long time.

309
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,500
And Mom?

310
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,800
She didn't go on a trip?

311
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,000
Is she dead too?

312
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,100
Yes.

313
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,300
She's dead too.

314
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,400
But that was a long time ago.

315
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,400
Klara!

316
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,100
Martin, you coming?

317
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,000
Karli?

318
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,600
You can come in.

319
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,300
What is it?

320
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,300
- What do you think?
- I don't know.

321
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,800
It's a boy.

322
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,700
What? Don't you want a brother?

323
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,900
Lucky your father didn't hear you.

324
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,600
I'm sorry.

325
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:46,100
They knew it was dangerous for her.

326
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,600
What do you want?

327
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,500
You want to sue the Baron?

328
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,400
Or murder the steward?

329
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,900
Go cut off his head
with your scythe!

330
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,200
Won't bring your mother
back to life.

331
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,000
Father, you loved our mother.

332
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,600
Shut up!

333
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,700
<i>After those two days in July,

334
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,100
<i>life in the village
got back to normal. 

335
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,500
<i>The daily harvesting chores
exhausted everyone. 

336
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,700
<i>Most of the kids pitched in
to help their parents. 

337
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,900
<i>I took up the steward's offer

338
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,900
<i>to be his secretary
during the harvesting,

339
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,200
<i>as I hoped it would enable me

340
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,600
<i>to see the young girl again. 

341
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,900
<i>I couldn't get her out of my mind
after our meeting. 

342
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,300
<i>But she rarely came out
of the manor house. 

343
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,600
<i>The doctor was still
in the hospital. 

344
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,000
<i>Anna and Rudolf, his two children,

345
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,600
<i>were cared for meanwhile
by the midwife. 

346
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,400
<i>After the farmer's wife's funeral,

347
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,800
<i>that the whole village attended,

348
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,200
<i>both accidents were forgotten. 

349
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,800
<i>Until the end of the summer

350
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:14,500
<i>when the harvest feast
reunited the whole village,

351
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,600
<i>first in a joyful mood,

352
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,100
<i>then in horror and perplexity. 

353
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,800
My thanks to all of you.

354
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,500
You have worked well.

355
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
The heavens were kind
and the barns are full.

356
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,500
So the beer can flow...

357
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,700
...and you won't starve today!

358
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,300
Long live the Baron!

359
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,600
Long may he live!

360
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
Most honorable Baron.

361
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,700
...and Baroness...

362
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,500
...dear merrymakers...

363
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,000
Let us hear on this festive occasion.

364
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,000
Psalm 145, Verse 15:

365
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,500
"The eyes of all wait upon thee, Lord;

366
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,800
"and thou givest them their meat
in due season... "

367
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:13,200
In the name of the Father...

368
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,000
...the Son...

369
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
...and the Holy Ghost.

370
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Amen.

371
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
Now enjoy your meal.

372
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,900
Eat and drink to your fill!
You earned it!

373
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,300
You promised us
a chorale by your pupils.

374
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,700
Ask the pastor, Baroness.

375
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,600
We're still practicing
for the confirmation feast.

376
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:27,500
That's in spring!
Now it's the fall.

377
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,000
Our little singers aren't all
very musical. Sorry!

378
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
Well, you two "mothers"?

379
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,600
Not taking part in the festivities?

380
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,100
It's so nice here in the shade.

381
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,200
Our son seems to be enjoying that!

382
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,300
Yes.

383
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,500
I can imagine.

384
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,900
Who wouldn't like it.

385
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,400
Georg!

386
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,900
What about yout?

387
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,800
Aren't you bored
caring for other's children...

388
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,600
with all the young lads over there?

389
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,900
No, sir.
I like being with the children.

390
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,000
How old are you anyway?

391
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,500
17, sir.

392
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
17!

393
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,200
Wouldn't you rather hold a suitor.

394
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
...than the Baroness's kids?

395
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,700
- Leave her alone, George!
- What did I do?

396
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,000
Won't you get us
something to eat, Emma?

397
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,900
If you'll mind
the children a moment, I'll go.

398
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:24,600
He was drunk,
but they couldn't stop him.

399
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,100
Leave Frieda alone!

400
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,700
Shove it!

401
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,600
...I'm the rooster on the tower...

402
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,400
Someone cut off
the Baron's cabbages.

403
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,700
What?

404
00:35:57,900 --> 00:36:00,300
Someone cut off
the Baron's cabbages!

405
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,600
- I never learned.
- Neither did I.

406
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,600
You have to count out loud.

407
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,300
One, two, three.

408
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,100
Your pupils will laugh
when they see us dancing, sir!

409
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,200
They'd better not!

410
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,300
And stop being so formal with me.
Am I so old?

411
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:38,300
It's coming along!

412
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,700
Well...

413
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,200
Don't look at your feet.

414
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,000
Quite a job, huh?

415
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,000
It's disgusting!

416
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,200
It was an old custom:
"Harvest's done, pay everyone...

417
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,100
"If we don't get our due,
your cabbage'll be sliced for you. "

418
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,000
Well, they sure slurped down enough!

419
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,200
Come in.

420
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,300
What do you want?

421
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,600
A favor, Father.

422
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,500
Yes?

423
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,500
Yes?

424
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,000
I found it.
It's wounded.

425
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,500
And?

426
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,600
May I keep it?

427
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,100
How will you go about that?

428
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,600
We'll heal it.

429
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,600
And when it's healed?

430
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,400
Won't you be attached to it then?

431
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,500
Will you let it fly away?

432
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,500
Piepsi still lives in a cage.

433
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,400
Yes, but it grew up in captivity.

434
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,600
This one is used to freedom.

435
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:58,800
Will you set it free,
once it's healed?

436
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,900
Have you asked Mother?

437
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,100
Yes.

438
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,000
What did she say?

439
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,000
That it was for you to decide,
Father.

440
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,100
Really?

441
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,100
That's what she said.

442
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,300
You'll really take care of it?

443
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,100
Yes.

444
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,900
You realize that's
a heavy responsibility?

445
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,300
You'll be its father and mother.

446
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,500
We'll have to find a cage
for your patient.

447
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,400
Did you do it, or didn't you?

448
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,900
- Seems somebody saw you.
- So what?

449
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,300
They're lucky
they still have their heads!

450
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,700
I have to tell you, Father:
I'm proud of it!

451
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,400
Sit down!

452
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,000
What did you intend to do?

453
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,800
Tell me.

454
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,800
Come on. Tell me.

455
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,200
You know why, Father.

456
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,800
Because of your mother?

457
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,200
You think they caused her death?

458
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,300
You think that?

459
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,200
That I'm not man enough
to settle it?

460
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:45,000
Know what your act
may do for us all?

461
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,000
If Frieda loses her job...

462
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,800
which keeps us alive
for a whole year?

463
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,600
If we can't work here
in the summer?

464
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,600
You want to marry
and run the farm in two years?

465
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,200
You'll feed everyone
without the help of the estate?

466
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,600
How do you know they're responsible?

467
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,800
How do you know they're innocent?

468
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,200
I don't know.

469
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
But I also don't know the opposite!

470
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,100
What do you mean "not there"?

471
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,600
He's disappeared.
I looked all over.

472
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:30,600
He hasn't disappeared.
When did you last see him?

473
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,100
Around 2 o'clock.

474
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,400
Around 2?

475
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,300
- You know what time it is?
- I know, Baron.

476
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,700
What does my wife say?

477
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,400
She sent me to you. She's terrified.

478
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:47,500
I can imagine.
You're an idiot, Huber.

479
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,200
Why do you think you're here?

480
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,300
To take care of one child!
Is that so hard?

481
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,300
I'm so sorry, Baron.

482
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,100
You can shove your excuses!

483
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,500
Where did you last see my son?

484
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,800
Here. He left to play
with the other kids.

485
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,700
- Where?
- He didn't say.

486
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,200
My wife noticed nothing either?

487
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
The cabbage heads affair upset her.

488
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,500
She retired, indisposed.

489
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,400
Indisposed?

490
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,000
Yes, a terrible migraine attack.

491
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,300
This is a madhouse!

492
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,500
Have you seen my son?

493
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,700
No.

494
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,600
Ask your sons. Sigi has disappeared
with some other kids.

495
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,900
- What does it mean?
- That he's disappeared, dammit!

496
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:37,000
<i>The steward's kids said
they'd only seen Sigi

497
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,400
<i>very briefly,

498
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,700
<i>that he'd gone off with other kids. 

499
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,000
<i>They didn't pay
much attention to it. 

500
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:47,000
<i>The search began
shortly after midnight. 

501
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,200
<i>The searchers, tired,
some still drunk,

502
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,100
<i>were divided into two groups:

503
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:57,900
<i>one searched
all the estate's buildings,

504
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:01,600
<i>the other combed the countryside. 

505
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,600
<i>Around 2.30 AM,
the siren sounded again

506
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,400
<i>calling the men back to the estate. 

507
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,100
<i>Sigi had been found. 

508
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,100
<i>He was in the sawmill,
tied upside down. 

509
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,700
<i>His trousers were pulled down,

510
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,800
<i>his buttocks
bleeding from cane strokes. 

511
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,300
<i>He was in a state of shock,
unable to walk. 

512
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,100
<i>Lying on his belly,

513
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:33,200
<i>he was carried home
on a makeshift stretcher. 

514
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,800
<i>Next Sunday, after the service,
the Baron asked the pastor

515
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,900
<i>to let him speak. 

516
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,700
City policemen questioned
many of you this week.

517
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,700
To no avail.

518
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,500
First I thought
my child was tortured.

519
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,000
...by those who cut off my cabbages.

520
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,200
To get even!

521
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,200
For what?

522
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,200
Supposedly it was my fault
their mother died in the sawmill...

523
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,900
which is absurd.

524
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,600
At least, young Felder.

525
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,400
...told the police that was his motive
for his "mowing prowess".

526
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,900
I've always helped
the Felder family.

527
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,100
But people aren't always grateful.

528
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,500
It takes character.

529
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,100
Don't run away, Felder!

530
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,400
It's your honor I want to salvage!

531
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:40,300
It turns out
the "valiant" Max Felder.

532
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:45,700
...boasted of his feat to his fiancÃ©e.
Then the coward.

533
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,700
...hid among his family...

534
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,400
...so he didn't have time
to torture my son.

535
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,100
As to his father,
he'd bite off his tongue.

536
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,400
...rather than cover
for his wayward son.

537
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:08,600
I'll remind you of a fact
that most of you may have forgotten.

538
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:13,700
Two months ago, our doctor
had a riding accident...

539
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:17,200
...and is still not back from the hospital.

540
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:19,600
This accident was caused.

541
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:22,300
...by a wire strung in his garden...

542
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:25,900
with the explicit intent
of bringing him down.

543
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:30,900
There, too, nobody knows...

544
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:33,100
...saw or heard anything.

545
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,700
We all know it:
those who injured my son...

546
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,200
...and the doctor...

547
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,300
...are here.

548
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:45,200
...among us...

549
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,000
...in this room.

550
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:51,400
I won't let such crimes
go unpunished...

551
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:53,700
...and hope nothing like that.

552
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,300
...happens to any of your children.

553
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,600
That's why I call upon you all:

554
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,800
...help me find the culprit
or the culprits!

555
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,500
If we fail to find out the truth...

556
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,600
...the peace of our community
will be gone.

557
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,000
<i>The landowner's speech
frightened the locals. 

558
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,400
<i>The Baron wasn't popular,

559
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,700
<i>but as a powerful figure
and employer of half the village,

560
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,400
<i>he was respected. 

561
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:28,500
<i>His statement
on the community's peace

562
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,100
<i>was ominous. 

563
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:36,000
<i>And the mysterious character
of these criminal deeds

564
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:39,800
<i>awakened the old mistrust
of the farmers. 

565
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:56,700
Come in!

566
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,000
Eva!

567
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,200
May I come in?

568
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,800
What a question!
Of course, come in.

569
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,700
What's it about?

570
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:18,500
What's wrong?

571
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,600
They fired me.

572
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,100
What do you mean?

573
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,900
Nothing. They just fired me.

574
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,700
The tutor was also fired.

575
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,600
I don't know where to go.

576
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm afraid on the road alone.

577
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,300
Don't worry. Calm down.

578
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,800
Come, sit here.

579
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,400
Calm down, tell me what happened.

580
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,000
Well?

581
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,000
What happened?

582
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,900
The Baron's son isn't at all well.

583
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,400
His parents are desperate and angry.

584
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,400
Now they say
the tutor and I are to blame...

585
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:30,200
...because we didn't pay
enough attention to him.

586
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:33,700
But I'm only there for the twins.

587
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,400
I've always taken care of them
very well.

588
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:41,900
When you and I were dancing...

589
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,400
...the Baroness
had given me permission.

590
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,300
I haven't done anything wrong.

591
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,000
I know, come on. Stop crying!

592
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,200
Where can I go now?

593
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,400
My family needs my earnings.

594
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,600
You'll find something else.

595
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,400
You know,
the Baron is quick-tempered.

596
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:08,000
But his bark is worse than his bite.

597
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,200
No, it's all over now, I know it.

598
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:14,700
The Baroness doesn't want
to see anyone.

599
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,500
She wants to take the kids
with her, to town...

600
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,400
...or to her parents' estate.

601
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,800
I'll try to talk to her.

602
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:29,300
We used to play piano together,
four-handed.

603
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,700
But I wasn't very good.

604
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,900
Now she's the tutor,
who studied the flute in town.

605
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:40,800
He doesn't play that well.

606
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,300
That's true.

607
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,100
Who does things like that?

608
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,300
What?

609
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,700
Beating a child like that.

610
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,100
I don't know.

611
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,700
Can I stay here tonight?

612
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:14,800
Don't send me away, sir, please.

613
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:16,700
How could you think that?

614
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,800
I'll just wait for daybreak,
here in the classroom.

615
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:23,900
Then I'll leave.

616
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,500
At home, they won't understand this.

617
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,100
They'll think I did something wrong.

618
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,900
Want me to come with you?

619
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,300
What?

620
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,100
Tomorrow, after school?

621
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:45,100
I'll find a carriage,
I'll be back by evening.

622
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:49,000
Why would you do that, sir?

623
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,100
Stop being so formal.

624
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,700
Why would you do that?

625
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:01,700
Come here,
I'll play something for you.

626
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,000
If you want.

627
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,400
Good morning, Father.

628
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,000
I'm back again.

629
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:32,700
They set me free.

630
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,700
I can see that. So what?

631
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,100
Can you forgive me, Father?

632
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:01,100
Forgive you for what?

633
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,200
That the estate
won't give me any work?

634
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,900
That Frieda was fired in disgrace?

635
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,800
That your brothers and sisters
have nothing to eat?

636
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,300
Or what?

637
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,400
<i>The next day, after school,
I went to the estate

638
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:20,500
<i>to inquire about Sigi's health

639
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:24,300
<i>and to intercede
for Eva's reinstatement. 

640
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:25,700
<i>I was told

641
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,300
<i>the Baroness had left that morning
with her children. 

642
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:35,700
<i>Reluctantly, the steward
lent me a carriage to take Eva home. 

643
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:40,100
<i>As we left the village,
we crossed the doctor. 

644
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,900
<i>A few days
after the Thanksgiving feast,

645
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:47,100
<i>Rudolf, his four-year-old son,
had suddenly disappeared. 

646
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,900
<i>This upset everyone
in view of the previous events. 

647
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:55,400
<i>The boy was finally found
on the main road,

648
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,900
<i>scantily dressed for a trip,

649
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,200
<i>walking eagerly toward the town. 

650
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,600
<i>When asked where he was going,

651
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:06,500
<i>he said he wanted
to visit his father. 

652
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:11,500
<i>He fought tooth and nail
against being taken home. 

653
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:15,200
<i>The doctor was told about this

654
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,300
<i>and, due to be released soon anyway,

655
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:24,000
<i>he decided to cut short his stay
at the hospital. 

656
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,300
Rudi?

657
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,400
He was in the living room.

658
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,700
What do I owe?

659
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,400
3.50 marks.

660
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:44,400
Thanks.

661
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:45,700
Have a nice day.

662
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,800
Rudi, where are you?

663
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,300
Hello, Rudi.

664
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,600
Won't you say hello to your father?

665
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:42,900
No?

666
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,600
I heard.

667
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,900
...you wanted to visit me
at the hospital.

668
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:53,600
And now you lock yourself in?

669
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,300
All right.

670
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:04,300
Then I don't want to see you.

671
00:56:05,300 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm going away now.

672
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,600
Stay in the toilet, if you want.

673
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:22,900
Keep well, Rudi.

674
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:43,700
Your office is ready.
Mrs Wagner did it all.

675
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,700
- Why do you tell me that?
- I don't know.

676
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:50,900
I thought you'd like to know.

677
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:54,000
- She took good care of you?
- Yes.

678
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:04,300
How old are you now?

679
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,300
14.

680
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,100
It's amazing...

681
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,700
...you look so like your mother.

682
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:36,400
...your mother and I
are very worried about you.

683
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:40,500
Think carefully. Do you sleep badly?

684
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,300
Are you overtired?

685
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:43,600
No.

686
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,700
Do you have problems at school
I don't know?

687
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,900
No, Father.

688
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:57,700
You don't understand why we worry.

689
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,500
I'll explain it to you.

690
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:05,400
As you know,
I'm also the pastor for Birkenbrunn.

691
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,600
One day, a mother came to see me...

692
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:12,900
...as her son,
about the same age as you...

693
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,100
...had the same symptoms.

694
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,600
...you've shown for some time.

695
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:24,300
The boy suddenly seemed
extremely weary.

696
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:29,100
His eyes were ringed,
he was depressed and joyless.

697
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,500
He avoided looking his parents
in the eye...

698
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:41,800
...and soon was also caught lying.

699
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,800
This lasted about half a year.

700
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,900
Then everything went very fast.

701
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,100
He lost his appetite...

702
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:06,200
...couldn't sleep any more,
his hands began to shake...

703
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,700
...his memory started to fail...

704
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,200
...his face became
covered with pustules...

705
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:15,300
...then his whole body.

706
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,400
Finally, he died.

707
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,200
The body, that I had to bless,
looked like an old man's body.

708
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,400
Do you understand now
why I'm worried?

709
01:00:33,100 --> 01:00:35,800
What do you think
caused these changes.

710
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:39,900
...that led
to that boy's miserable end?

711
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:41,900
I don't know.

712
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:46,700
I think you know very well.

713
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,600
Won't you tell me?

714
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,000
No?

715
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:15,900
Then I'll give you the answer.

716
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:20,300
The boy had seen someone...

717
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:23,500
who was harming
the finest nerves of his body...

718
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,300
...in the area where God
has erected sacred barriers.

719
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,800
The boy imitated this action.

720
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,600
He couldn't stop doing it.

721
01:01:36,100 --> 01:01:40,500
In the end he destroyed
all his nerves, and died of it.

722
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,700
I just want to help you.

723
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,900
I love you with all my heart.

724
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:52,300
Be sincere, Martin.

725
01:01:53,100 --> 01:01:56,900
Why did you blush listening
to the story of the poor boy?

726
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:58,700
Blush?

727
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:01,900
I don't know. I felt sorry for him.

728
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,600
Is that all?

729
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,000
I think there's another reason.

730
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,100
It's written on your face.

731
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,300
Be sincere...

732
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,700
Martin!

733
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,000
Why are you crying?

734
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,100
Shall I spare you that confession?

735
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,600
Have you been doing
what that wretched boy did?

736
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,700
Yes.

737
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,600
My arm!

738
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:23,400
Glad that you're back. About time.

739
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:26,200
One can say that. Yes.

740
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:36,500
It was hard with the children,
without you.

741
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:38,600
I know.

742
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,700
He doesn't like me.

743
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,500
- Who?
- Rudi.

744
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:53,400
He's at a difficult age.

745
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:56,500
Actually not.

746
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,900
They're always at a difficult age.

747
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:04,600
Yes.

748
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:10,100
You didn't miss me.

749
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:13,100
What does that mean?

750
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,700
Nothing.
I said it because it's true.

751
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:25,300
Nothing like
a nice dose of self-hate!

752
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,100
What?

753
01:04:27,800 --> 01:04:30,100
Nothing. Forget it.

754
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:00,000
Winter came early that year.

755
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,800
For Reformation Day,
on the first Sunday of November,

756
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,700
a blanket of snow
covered the village.

757
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:12,600
Quite unusually, the Baron,
whose family had not yet come back,

758
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,500
didn't attend the service.

759
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:20,000
The villagers took that
as a sign of his anger.

760
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,500
Indeed, no leads had been found

761
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:24,500
to a possible culprit,

762
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:27,100
although the Baron's appeal

763
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,400
had led to a flood
of mutual suspicions,

764
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,200
even to some attempts
at denunciation,

765
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:38,200
that had all turned out
to be untenable.

766
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Well, it's not pneumonia.

767
01:05:54,600 --> 01:05:56,100
But you must be careful.

768
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,200
If his temperature rises,
call me again.

769
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,300
Give him these drops
every two hours.

770
01:06:02,900 --> 01:06:05,100
And hang wet sheets over the oven.

771
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,000
That helps breathing.

772
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,600
- Good night to you.
- Good-bye, Doctor.

773
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:18,700
How long was the window open?

774
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,300
Hard to say.
My wife nursed him around 1 AM.

775
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,600
She came back around 2:30 AM.

776
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,300
By then the room was icy cold.

777
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,400
And the baby didn't cry?

778
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,400
No. The children heard nothing.

779
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,500
He's doing all right.
We have to wait.

780
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:41,500
But it looks fairly good.

781
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,000
A drink to warm you up?

782
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,100
Or stay for supper.

783
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:51,100
No, thanks. I'm overloaded,
I was away so long.

784
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,100
How's your arm doing?

785
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:02,900
It's all right.

786
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:06,400
It'll be fine
in two or three weeks.

787
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:07,800
Thank you.

788
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,900
That must be terrible, I imagine.

789
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,200
One must be helpless
with only one arm.

790
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,500
Quod erat demonstrandum.

791
01:07:19,500 --> 01:07:21,300
Well, good night, children.

792
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,800
Good night, Doctor.

793
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,700
If your wife thinks
the baby's fever has risen again...

794
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,100
...let me know.

795
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:40,000
Good...

796
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:43,100
What do you mean "good"?

797
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,200
I mean, that's fine.

798
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,600
When did you go see Father?

799
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:00,000
Down in his office.

800
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:04,500
Why?

801
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,300
Just asking.

802
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:13,200
In mid-December,
I finally got a letter from Eva.

803
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,800
Her father
had found her a job in town,

804
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,200
that she'd start early
in the New Year.

805
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,800
Since the night she came
to shelter in the school,

806
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,000
when until dawn,

807
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:31,800
we told each other the story
of our short lives,

808
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:34,200
her pale face,

809
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:38,000
her shy but frank personality,

810
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:40,700
were constantly on my mind.

811
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:46,100
The school holidays
lasted until January 2nd,

812
01:08:46,800 --> 01:08:49,600
but already
on the day after Christmas,

813
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,000
in the cold but sunny weather,

814
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:54,500
I headed for Treglitz

815
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:57,300
to visit Eva and her parents.

816
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,300
And Sigi?

817
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,100
I don't know.
The Baroness isn't back yet.

818
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,600
And the Baron?

819
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:14,800
We hardly see him.
He talks to nobody.

820
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,400
I don't know.
Some say they went to Italy.

821
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:23,800
To Italy?

822
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,900
The steward says they'll tear down
the sawmill. Because it's...

823
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,700
Good morning.

824
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,200
Morning, young man.

825
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:48,100
Please be seated.
We're not very formal here.

826
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:49,800
Scram!

827
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,600
Care for a drink?

828
01:10:06,700 --> 01:10:08,200
No, thanks. Very kind.

829
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,300
- Really?
- No, thanks a lot.

830
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:17,000
So you're a schoolteacher?

831
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:21,000
Can you afford to have a wife?

832
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,300
My father's a tailor at Vasendorf.
I've learned the trade.

833
01:10:25,300 --> 01:10:27,200
I earn money on the side.

834
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:31,800
Taking over his business
would've been smarter.

835
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:42,100
And why are you so focused on Eva?

836
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:46,100
She's still a child.
You could be her father.

837
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,000
I'm 31.

838
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,300
Well, you're not far off.

839
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:51,700
Father!

840
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,200
Have you asked her
if she's interested?

841
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:04,900
She's a child,
knows nothing about life.

842
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,700
Speak up. Do you want him?

843
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,700
Come on. Say something.

844
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,700
He came all this way in the cold.

845
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,900
Leave her alone. Of course,
she wants him. Can't you tell?

846
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,300
How can I, if she clams up!

847
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:34,500
Sit down again.

848
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,300
Women!

849
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,100
Don't take them too seriously.

850
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,700
Listen, I'm not a big talker.

851
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,900
On one hand, it suits mea
if she leaves the house.

852
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,700
Lots of mouths to feed,
as you can see.

853
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,000
On the other hand...

854
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,700
...it's moving too fast for me.

855
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:03,800
I don't know you.

856
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:07,800
I don't dislike you,
but I need to know more about you.

857
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:15,300
The town hairdresser has agreed
to take her on as an apprentice.

858
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,100
She'll get to meet people...

859
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,700
...she can decide
if she really wants this.

860
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:25,800
If in a year
she's still in favor of it...

861
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,600
we'll talk about it again.

862
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,700
You can make up your mind too.

863
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,500
All right?

864
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,200
- I actually thought I...
- Yes, I know.

865
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:41,800
But it's either that or nothing.

866
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:47,200
If you insist...

867
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,900
Yes, I do.

868
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:56,300
Delighted.

869
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,000
So, my work's waiting.

870
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:06,200
Even on holidays.

871
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:08,200
Don't get up.

872
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:10,900
I'll send the kid back in.

873
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:17,200
So you can say good bye.

874
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:20,100
A year goes by fast.
The world won't collapse.

875
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,300
You can come and visit her.

876
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,600
Did your father tell you?...

877
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,100
Is that all right with you?

878
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:24,900
And is it with you, sir?

879
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,700
Don't call me "sir".

880
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:55,800
Adi! Are you awake?

881
01:14:57,300 --> 01:14:58,600
Adi!

882
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,200
What is it?

883
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:02,300
Look!

884
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:04,700
What's happening?

885
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,300
Look! Go see what's happening!

886
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:10,600
My God, what do you want?

887
01:15:10,900 --> 01:15:12,900
Over there! Look out the window!

888
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:26,700
Something's burning! On the estate!

889
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,300
Untie me!

890
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,100
Come on, untie me!

891
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,200
I don't know if...

892
01:15:32,300 --> 01:15:33,500
Untie me, I said!

893
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,400
What is it?

894
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:36,900
Be quiet!

895
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:39,000
Gustl, come and untie me!

896
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,600
What's going on?

897
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:45,100
Untie me, dammit!
There's a fire!

898
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,900
What fire?

899
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,700
A fire!

900
01:15:55,800 --> 01:15:58,400
Yes, a fire! Now untie me, dammit!

901
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,300
Father won't allow it.

902
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:05,400
It's an emergency!
Somebody must warn them!

903
01:16:05,700 --> 01:16:06,700
Father!

904
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,700
Stop shouting! I'll do it!

905
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,900
Shall I call Mom?

906
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,800
- What is it?
- A fire!

907
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:25,200
I know. Your father already went.

908
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,100
What are you doing here?

909
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:32,200
Go to bed now! It's nothing.

910
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,000
There's a fire on the estate.
Don't be afraid.

911
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:38,600
Go to bed and sleep.

912
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:43,100
Go on! You'll catch a cold.

913
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:50,200
Why all the noise?
You woke them all up!

914
01:16:50,500 --> 01:16:52,700
I thought it was dangerous.

915
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
I had to untie him.

916
01:16:55,300 --> 01:16:57,100
Now everything's fine again.

917
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,200
Tomorrow,
Father will tell you about the fire.

918
01:17:00,600 --> 01:17:02,000
You all go back to bed.

919
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,600
I'll wait till you're in bed.

920
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:07,100
It's cold here.

921
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:21,000
Good night, then.

922
01:17:22,500 --> 01:17:23,800
Sleep tight.

923
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,600
Night, Mom!

924
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,800
Why don't you stop doing that?

925
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:36,700
Why all the effort?

926
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:39,900
Don't look so dumbfounded.

927
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,100
You don't lack talent.

928
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:44,800
I just can't do it
with you any more.

929
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:48,900
To be truthful: you disgust me.

930
01:19:50,300 --> 01:19:51,800
Can't you finish your work?

931
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:54,100
I don't want
to spend the night here.

932
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,800
What did I do to you?

933
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:03,600
My God, you've done nothing to me!

934
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,500
You're ugly, messy...

935
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:11,000
...flabby and have bad breath.
Will that do?

936
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:16,600
The cover has to be sterilized.

937
01:20:16,700 --> 01:20:21,800
Don't sit there
looking like death warmed over.

938
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,600
The world won't collapse.
Not on you...

939
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:26,800
...or on me.

940
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,300
I can't go on with this, that's all.

941
01:20:36,400 --> 01:20:38,200
I've really tried...

942
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:43,500
...to think of another woman
while making love to you.

943
01:20:44,500 --> 01:20:46,400
One who smells good...

944
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,500
who's young, less decrepit than you...

945
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,000
...but my imagination can't manage it.

946
01:20:56,300 --> 01:20:58,200
In the end, it's you again.

947
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:01,200
...and then I feel like puking...

948
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:03,900
...and am embarrassed at myself.

949
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,500
So what's the point?

950
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,000
Are you through?

951
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,200
I have been for ages.

952
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:17,100
You must be very unhappy
to be so mean.

953
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,200
Please, not that routine!

954
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,700
I know I'm not much to look at.

955
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,200
My bad breath comes from my ulcer,
you know that.

956
01:21:30,400 --> 01:21:33,600
It didn't bother you in the past.

957
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:36,500
I had it when your wife was alive.

958
01:21:36,700 --> 01:21:39,500
Spare me these sordid details.

959
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:43,000
Let me reassure you:
it always disgusted me.

960
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:48,000
After Julie's death,
I wanted to ease my pain.

961
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:51,400
with anyone.
I could have screwed a cow!

962
01:21:53,500 --> 01:21:55,200
Whores are too far from here...

963
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:58,100
...and once every two months
isn't enough for me...

964
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,600
...even though I'm getting on.

965
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:04,700
So skip acting like a martyr,
and scram.

966
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,800
Why are you only noticing this now?

967
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:12,700
When should I have noticed it?

968
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,900
At the hospital,
I forgot how tiresome you are.

969
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,600
One grows sentimental when in pain.

970
01:22:23,500 --> 01:22:26,100
Get out! Don't you have any pride?

971
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,800
There's no room for any with you.

972
01:22:31,700 --> 01:22:32,900
That's true.

973
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:37,400
What if I do something silly?

974
01:22:39,200 --> 01:22:40,300
Go ahead.

975
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,200
It'd surprise me. But be careful:

976
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,200
...it may be painful.

977
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:48,200
I know, I'm ridiculous.

978
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,100
You wouldn't care anyway.

979
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:53,400
Well...

980
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:58,600
Why do you despise me?

981
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,400
For helping to raise the boy?

982
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:06,900
For watching you
finger your daughter.

983
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:08,400
...and saying nothing?

984
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:13,400
For helping you to deceive yourself?

985
01:23:14,500 --> 01:23:17,400
For listening to you
claim how you loved Julie...

986
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:21,800
when everyone knew
you treated her as badly as me?

987
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:28,000
For loving you,
when I know you can't stand.

988
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,200
...being loved?

989
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,500
That's it.

990
01:23:30,700 --> 01:23:33,000
Now get up. I have work to do.

991
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,500
You can't afford to get rid of me.

992
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:40,000
Who'll do the dirty work for you...

993
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:43,100
who'll help you with the kids,
and your practice?

994
01:23:44,700 --> 01:23:46,400
You don't mean what you're saying.

995
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,300
I want to see how far you can go:

996
01:23:49,500 --> 01:23:53,000
"Will she take it?
Can I drag her even lower?"

997
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:57,700
I'm tired too.

998
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,300
I've got two retarded kids:
Karli and you.

999
01:24:01,600 --> 01:24:03,000
You're the most troublesome one.

1000
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,700
My God, why don't you just die?

1001
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:47,800
The year ended with fine weather.

1002
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:50,900
The snowy landscape
sparkled so brightly

1003
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:53,400
that it hurt the eyes.

1004
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:55,300
None of us suspected

1005
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,400
it'd be our last New Year
in an era of peace,

1006
01:25:58,400 --> 01:26:02,600
and that this year
would bring a radical change,

1007
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:06,700
of a magnitude we couldn't foresee.

1008
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,100
Despite the strange events
that had unsettled the village,

1009
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,700
we thought of ourselves
as united in the belief

1010
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,100
that life in our community
was God's will, and worth living.

1011
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:25,900
...Christ's body
as bread and as wine.

1012
01:26:27,300 --> 01:26:31,800
May the period of preparation
for your confirmation.

1013
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,300
...be one of happiness.

1014
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,600
...and enrichment.

1015
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:42,200
You, Martin...

1016
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:46,700
will now be free
not only of that ribbon...

1017
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:51,000
...but of those nightly ties.

1018
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:55,200
...that kept you from yielding to
the temptations of your young body.

1019
01:27:00,700 --> 01:27:03,600
I trust you, my beloved children...

1020
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:07,100
...and wish you
a profitable and happy new year.

1021
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:13,700
Shortly after Easter,
in the last week of April,

1022
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:16,400
the Baroness came back
with the children.

1023
01:27:16,700 --> 01:27:19,500
She was accompanied by a new nanny.

1024
01:27:20,500 --> 01:27:25,200
My secret hope
that Eva could come back here,

1025
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,200
was definitely dashed.

1026
01:27:28,300 --> 01:27:31,500
The new nanny was an Italian woman

1027
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:35,500
who came from the area
on the Mediterranean coast

1028
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:38,800
where the Baroness
had spent the winter.

1029
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,100
Sigi!

1030
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:43,700
Hi, Ferdinand!

1031
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,400
Wait!

1032
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,100
I'll come down!

1033
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:52,300
Stay here, Sigi!
You can see the boys later.

1034
01:27:52,300 --> 01:27:53,900
Let him go, Madam.

1035
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:56,400
He's so happy to be back home!

1036
01:27:56,600 --> 01:27:59,200
All right, go.
But don't be too long.

1037
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,500
Marie-Luise?

1038
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,700
Where are you?

1039
01:29:02,900 --> 01:29:04,000
Sigi!

1040
01:29:04,700 --> 01:29:06,800
Won't you come say hello to your father?

1041
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,000
Watch out, he's coming!

1042
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:30,300
Be quiet!

1043
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,700
For God's sake! Be quiet!

1044
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:34,000
Quiet!

1045
01:29:57,800 --> 01:29:59,000
What's going on here?

1046
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,700
Why are you still here?

1047
01:30:01,200 --> 01:30:03,600
There's a divinity class now!

1048
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,000
Get going!

1049
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:07,900
How about a good-bye?

1050
01:30:08,100 --> 01:30:09,800
Good bye, sir!

1051
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:17,100
Good bye, Pastor!

1052
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:20,600
I'm sorry, Pastor.
It won't happen again.

1053
01:30:24,500 --> 01:30:25,700
Good bye, Pastor.

1054
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:27,800
Good bye.

1055
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:34,000
Let us pray.

1056
01:30:36,000 --> 01:30:38,100
Our Father, who art in heaven.

1057
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,800
...hallowed by Thy name...

1058
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,300
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done.

1059
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:47,500
...on earth as it is in Heaven.

1060
01:30:48,400 --> 01:30:51,200
Give us this day our daily bread.

1061
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,700
...and forgive us our trespasses.

1062
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:57,200
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

1063
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,400
And lead us not into temptation.

1064
01:30:59,700 --> 01:31:02,400
...but deliver us from evil.

1065
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:05,500
...for Thine is the kingdom, the power.

1066
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,300
...and the glory.

1067
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:09,100
...for ever and ever.

1068
01:31:09,400 --> 01:31:10,500
Amen.

1069
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:13,800
Sit down.

1070
01:31:27,300 --> 01:31:29,800
This is a very sad day for me.

1071
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:36,000
In a few weeks, we all want
to celebrate your confirmation.

1072
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,400
For months I've tried
to bring God's word closer to you...

1073
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:46,000
...and make responsible
human beings out of you.

1074
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:50,200
Who do I face today?

1075
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:53,200
Yelling monkeys...

1076
01:31:54,500 --> 01:31:58,700
...undisciplined, as childish
as your 7-year-old classmates!

1077
01:32:01,800 --> 01:32:03,200
But to me...

1078
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,800
what is even sadder.

1079
01:32:07,400 --> 01:32:09,000
...is that my own daughter.

1080
01:32:09,100 --> 01:32:12,300
...plays the leading role
in this pitiful display.

1081
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:18,000
Last year.

1082
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:21,000
I tied a white ribbon in her hair.

1083
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:24,800
White, as you all know...

1084
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,700
...is the color of innocence.

1085
01:32:27,700 --> 01:32:30,900
The ribbon was meant
to help Klara avoid sin...

1086
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:33,900
...selfishness...

1087
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:35,300
...envy...

1088
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:39,500
...indecency, lies and sloth.

1089
01:32:41,700 --> 01:32:43,600
At the start of the year...

1090
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:46,200
I naïvely believed.

1091
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,700
...that she was now mature enough.

1092
01:32:50,800 --> 01:32:52,700
...not to need that ribbon any more.

1093
01:32:54,200 --> 01:32:56,600
That she'd become
responsible enough...

1094
01:32:56,600 --> 01:32:59,100
...as the daughter
of the spiritual leader of...

1095
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,200
Anni?

1096
01:33:27,300 --> 01:33:29,700
Anni? Where are you?

1097
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:07,900
Anni?

1098
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:54,800
Rudi? What are you doing here?

1099
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:57,500
Why aren't you in bed?

1100
01:34:57,700 --> 01:35:00,300
I can't go to sleep.

1101
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:03,100
Is that why you're wandering around?

1102
01:35:03,400 --> 01:35:06,100
I woke up and you weren't there.

1103
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,600
Dad has pierced my earlobes.

1104
01:35:13,100 --> 01:35:14,800
Does it hurt?

1105
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:17,500
Yes, a bit.

1106
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,700
Is that why you're crying?

1107
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:21,500
I'm not crying any more.

1108
01:35:24,700 --> 01:35:26,400
Beauty has to suffer.

1109
01:35:29,700 --> 01:35:31,400
That's what they say.

1110
01:35:39,700 --> 01:35:41,100
Go back to bed.

1111
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:43,400
Anni's coming.

1112
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:53,800
I haven't worn earrings in ages,
so the holes closed up.

1113
01:35:58,300 --> 01:36:01,000
For Whitsun...

1114
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,400
I'm getting Mom's.

1115
01:36:05,000 --> 01:36:06,400
The pretty ones...

1116
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:08,300
...you know?

1117
01:36:52,200 --> 01:36:55,400
A few days
after Klara's fainting fit,

1118
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,100
that frightened us all,

1119
01:36:57,100 --> 01:37:00,900
and left her feverish and weakened,

1120
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,700
I went to see the steward,
on the eve of Whitsun

1121
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,400
to borrow the carriage again.

1122
01:37:08,300 --> 01:37:12,400
Since my marriage proposal,
Eva wrote me once a week.

1123
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:17,000
I felt she was alone
and lost in the city,

1124
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:22,000
and was hinting for me
to come see her as soon as I could.

1125
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,300
I wanted to spend Saturday with her

1126
01:37:25,300 --> 01:37:27,300
and be back on Sunday

1127
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:31,300
to prepare the confirmation ceremony
with the pastor.

1128
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:35,200
The steward had gone to the sawmill,

1129
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,300
but was due back any minute.

1130
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,400
Good morning, sir.

1131
01:38:05,400 --> 01:38:06,800
Hello, Erna.

1132
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:18,000
He's cute.

1133
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,000
Do you like him?

1134
01:38:21,300 --> 01:38:22,400
Yes. Very much.

1135
01:38:26,700 --> 01:38:29,000
He was quite sick last winter,
I was told.

1136
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:30,900
Yes. Very sick.

1137
01:38:31,500 --> 01:38:34,900
But the doctor cured him, thank God.

1138
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,200
Maybe I'll come back this evening.

1139
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,700
I'm sure Father will come for coffee.

1140
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:41,900
...at four.

1141
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:44,600
Then I'll sit down again.

1142
01:38:44,900 --> 01:38:47,500
Can I get you something? A coffee?

1143
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:49,200
It must be ready.

1144
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:53,000
No, thanks.
I'll just sit and wait.

1145
01:38:53,000 --> 01:38:54,300
Sir!

1146
01:38:58,400 --> 01:39:01,100
Can dreams come true?

1147
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:04,600
That depends.

1148
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,000
On what?

1149
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:08,200
On what does it depend?

1150
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:13,500
If you dream of being
first in your class, and study hard...

1151
01:39:14,000 --> 01:39:15,800
...your dream may come true.

1152
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:18,500
- I didn't mean that.
- Then what?

1153
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,700
I mean, if you dream of something...

1154
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,300
...really dream it in your sleep...

1155
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:27,800
...can it come true?

1156
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:30,700
Why, what did you dream?

1157
01:39:34,700 --> 01:39:35,800
Tell me.

1158
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:38,500
You have something on your mind.

1159
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,200
So tell me.

1160
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:46,300
I dreamt that Karli...

1161
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:49,600
- The odd little boy of the...
- I know.

1162
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:52,100
Something terrible
will happen to him.

1163
01:39:52,900 --> 01:39:54,300
Something terrible?

1164
01:39:55,400 --> 01:39:56,800
Like what?

1165
01:39:57,900 --> 01:39:59,400
I don't know.

1166
01:40:00,100 --> 01:40:02,100
Like what happened to Sigi.

1167
01:40:03,500 --> 01:40:04,700
But even worse.

1168
01:40:05,400 --> 01:40:08,500
But he's so sweet. He harms no one.

1169
01:40:08,800 --> 01:40:10,200
Come on...

1170
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:15,100
It was only a dream.
Don't take it so seriously.

1171
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:27,600
Dreams don't come true.
Let alone that kind.

1172
01:40:31,900 --> 01:40:34,700
But sometimes
my dreams do come true.

1173
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,600
What do you mean?

1174
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:42,300
Last winter...

1175
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:45,200
...before Gustl got sick...

1176
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:48,900
I dreamt
my brother opened his window...

1177
01:40:49,100 --> 01:40:50,900
...so he'd die.

1178
01:40:51,100 --> 01:40:55,000
And his window was opened,
he caught a chill, almost died.

1179
01:40:57,700 --> 01:40:59,300
What are you saying?

1180
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,000
That's nonsense!

1181
01:41:22,200 --> 01:41:25,500
We arranged to meet
at the railway station,

1182
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:29,200
as Eva wanted to avoid
being seen with me.

1183
01:41:29,700 --> 01:41:32,500
She was living with distant cousins,

1184
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,700
who gave her parents

1185
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,500
regular reports on her behavior.

1186
01:41:38,900 --> 01:41:42,600
She had become thinner,
which made her even prettier.

1187
01:41:43,300 --> 01:41:46,000
I was ravished again
by her mixture of shyness

1188
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,600
and almost childlike outspokenness.

1189
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:51,100
So it's not really so awful?

1190
01:41:51,400 --> 01:41:54,200
No. But sweeping up hair all day...

1191
01:41:54,500 --> 01:41:55,900
The twins were more fun.

1192
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:59,900
But it's all right.
I can't really complain.

1193
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:01,000
No?

1194
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:02,200
No.

1195
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:03,600
Really.

1196
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,400
Aside from the twins,
you miss nothing?

1197
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,300
Come on, you!

1198
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:34,000
How is the nanny? She only speaks Italian?

1199
01:42:34,300 --> 01:42:36,100
That's what the steward says.

1200
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:37,400
I see.

1201
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,100
Where are you going?

1202
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:50,100
There's a nice little pond
in the wood.

1203
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:53,300
We can picnic there.
I brought some food.

1204
01:42:55,900 --> 01:42:58,100
- I'd rather not.
- Why?

1205
01:43:02,900 --> 01:43:04,100
What is it?

1206
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:06,100
Nothing.

1207
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:08,400
Please.

1208
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,200
I had no improper intentions.

1209
01:43:13,500 --> 01:43:16,000
I just wanted you
to enjoy the picnic.

1210
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:20,200
Please.

1211
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:24,800
How could I disgrace my future wife?

1212
01:43:29,900 --> 01:43:31,300
All right then.

1213
01:43:31,400 --> 01:43:32,800
I'll turn around.

1214
01:43:46,400 --> 01:43:47,700
Thanks.

1215
01:44:18,100 --> 01:44:19,900
Accept and drink!

1216
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:23,500
This is the blood
of the New Testament...

1217
01:44:23,700 --> 01:44:25,500
...shed for you.

1218
01:44:25,800 --> 01:44:27,700
...to forgive your sins.

1219
01:45:57,800 --> 01:45:59,200
Here! He's here!

1220
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,300
Out of the way!

1221
01:46:22,800 --> 01:46:24,700
"For I, the Lord, your God.

1222
01:46:24,800 --> 01:46:26,400
"am a jealous God.

1223
01:46:27,300 --> 01:46:32,000
"visiting the iniquity of the fathers
upon the children.

1224
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:35,100
...unto the third
and fourth generation. "

1225
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:39,500
After the atrocities committed
on the retarded boy,

1226
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:42,900
the Baron was finally convinced
it was smarter

1227
01:46:43,200 --> 01:46:48,000
to enlist the help
of the county's police force.

1228
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,100
So a few days later

1229
01:46:50,300 --> 01:46:53,200
two plainclothes policemen arrived,

1230
01:46:53,500 --> 01:46:56,700
who, after visiting
several of the crime scenes,

1231
01:46:56,900 --> 01:47:00,300
inquired if anyone
had noticed anything suspicious.

1232
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:04,700
When I learnt of Karli's torture,

1233
01:47:04,900 --> 01:47:08,900
I didn't think
of what Erna had told me.

1234
01:47:09,100 --> 01:47:13,600
When I remembered,
I hesitated to tell the authorities.

1235
01:47:13,900 --> 01:47:17,900
Such an absurd coincidence
might jeopardize

1236
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,700
the reputation and inner peace
of the steward's family.

1237
01:47:22,500 --> 01:47:27,700
But when I heard that Karli
might lose his eyesight,

1238
01:47:27,900 --> 01:47:30,600
I made Erna come to the school

1239
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,500
and tell the policemen
about her dream.

1240
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:35,900
...we're not as stupid as you think.

1241
01:47:36,200 --> 01:47:38,400
But I really dreamt it!

1242
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:44,800
Watch out!

1243
01:47:47,000 --> 01:47:48,700
I'll give you one last chance:

1244
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:54,100
...tell us who told you
of a plan to torture the boy...

1245
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:57,100
...and we won't repeat it to anyone.

1246
01:47:57,300 --> 01:47:58,400
All right?

1247
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:04,800
She's already had dreams
that came true.

1248
01:48:05,600 --> 01:48:06,800
Is that so?

1249
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,900
About what, may I ask?

1250
01:48:10,600 --> 01:48:12,800
It was a family matter.

1251
01:48:13,300 --> 01:48:15,500
I see! A family matter.

1252
01:48:15,800 --> 01:48:17,700
You checked if it was true?

1253
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:19,000
No.

1254
01:48:21,300 --> 01:48:22,400
Well...

1255
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:25,000
...it may be true.

1256
01:48:26,200 --> 01:48:28,800
Maybe she's
an authentic clairvoyant...

1257
01:48:29,100 --> 01:48:31,300
...and we're luckier than we think.

1258
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:33,600
Stop crying!

1259
01:48:36,200 --> 01:48:39,400
Your deceitful whining
won't work with me.

1260
01:48:39,700 --> 01:48:42,300
I've got other ways
to make you talk.

1261
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:46,000
I don't believe in witches
and sorcerers...

1262
01:48:46,300 --> 01:48:50,500
...even less in the hallucinations
of a brat like you.

1263
01:48:51,700 --> 01:48:54,000
So make up your mind
to tell me the truth.

1264
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:57,100
I won't let go till you come clean.
Got that?

1265
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,600
Now let's go see
what your parents think.

1266
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,500
...of your version of the story.

1267
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:07,100
Can you come with us?

1268
01:49:07,400 --> 01:49:08,600
Of course.

1269
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:12,100
Hello, there!

1270
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,100
Who do we have here?

1271
01:49:14,600 --> 01:49:15,900
Good afternoon.

1272
01:49:16,100 --> 01:49:17,400
Good afternoon, sir.

1273
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:21,000
Why do you eavesdrop?

1274
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:25,400
We saw the teacher had visitors.
We didn't want to intrude.

1275
01:49:25,700 --> 01:49:28,200
We were waiting to talk to him.

1276
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:29,700
What do you want?

1277
01:49:30,900 --> 01:49:32,700
To ask you about Karli.

1278
01:49:32,900 --> 01:49:34,100
Like what?

1279
01:49:35,300 --> 01:49:37,200
We heard he isn't well.

1280
01:49:37,900 --> 01:49:40,000
We wondered if we could help.

1281
01:49:43,300 --> 01:49:44,400
You'll be all right...

1282
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:53,800
I know, it hurts.

1283
01:50:04,600 --> 01:50:06,400
Be patient...

1284
01:50:14,700 --> 01:50:16,300
Everything will be fine again.

1285
01:50:17,100 --> 01:50:18,600
It'll be fine.

1286
01:50:29,600 --> 01:50:31,400
I have to go now, Karli.

1287
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,000
Don't worry.

1288
01:50:36,400 --> 01:50:37,800
I'll be back tomorrow.

1289
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,700
You'll be all right.
Don't be afraid.

1290
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:46,400
The doctor will be back.

1291
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,500
Come in!

1292
01:52:56,100 --> 01:52:57,300
Yes?

1293
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,200
What is it?

1294
01:53:17,500 --> 01:53:19,200
To replace Piepsi.

1295
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:22,700
Because you're so sad.

1296
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:31,300
Thank you.

1297
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:35,800
You're welcome, Father.

1298
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,800
- Give me the whistle!
- Sorry?

1299
01:54:29,100 --> 01:54:31,100
The whistle!

1300
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:33,100
What whistle?

1301
01:54:34,000 --> 01:54:35,200
Give it to me!

1302
01:54:35,700 --> 01:54:37,200
What whistle?

1303
01:54:39,700 --> 01:54:41,400
Give it, or I'll kill you.

1304
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:43,700
I have no whistle.

1305
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:47,000
Bastard!

1306
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,100
Wretch!

1307
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:50,700
For God's sake...

1308
01:54:51,400 --> 01:54:52,800
what's got into you?

1309
01:54:53,300 --> 01:54:54,500
What has he done?

1310
01:54:55,500 --> 01:54:59,500
For the last time, give it to me!

1311
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:01,200
Give you what, Father?

1312
01:55:01,500 --> 01:55:02,700
What is it?

1313
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,600
What are you talking about?

1314
01:55:05,700 --> 01:55:07,400
You know what I mean!

1315
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:10,800
But if he says so!
What's going on?

1316
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:18,700
Please wait!

1317
01:55:19,900 --> 01:55:21,600
What did the boy do?

1318
01:55:21,900 --> 01:55:23,500
Calm down.

1319
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:28,000
Stay out of it!
I have to go back to the Baron.

1320
01:55:46,300 --> 01:55:49,200
Georg! Please, don't!

1321
01:55:49,600 --> 01:55:51,600
You'll kill him!

1322
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:56,200
...with the birch-trees in Retenow,
it'll be 6,000 cubic meters.

1323
01:55:57,100 --> 01:56:00,100
It'll take them around three weeks.

1324
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:05,400
And now we have 80 extra Poles.

1325
01:56:06,200 --> 01:56:08,400
They've been put up in the annex.

1326
01:56:08,700 --> 01:56:10,900
We're all out of bedding.

1327
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,100
It takes time.

1328
01:56:15,700 --> 01:56:17,600
There are lots of kids with them.

1329
01:56:18,500 --> 01:56:19,900
In spite of it...

1330
01:56:19,900 --> 01:56:21,600
I won't stay here.

1331
01:56:22,200 --> 01:56:23,400
What?

1332
01:56:24,200 --> 01:56:25,700
I won't stay here.

1333
01:56:30,500 --> 01:56:31,700
What does that mean?

1334
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:34,500
That I'm leaving with the children.

1335
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:37,000
What do you mean?

1336
01:56:37,300 --> 01:56:39,700
Armin!
That's not so hard to understand.

1337
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:44,800
How do you plan to do all this?

1338
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:48,100
I don't know yet.

1339
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,700
But in any case,
we're leaving this place.

1340
01:56:51,800 --> 01:56:52,900
"We"?

1341
01:56:54,200 --> 01:56:55,200
Yes.

1342
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,700
That'll be all, thank you.

1343
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:18,000
Good night, Baroness and Baron.

1344
01:57:34,500 --> 01:57:37,500
I only came back
out of fairness to you.

1345
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:43,100
To give us a chance.

1346
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,800
You gave me a chance?

1347
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:54,700
Wonderful! And I missed my chance?

1348
01:57:55,700 --> 01:57:58,500
Will that help us
to solve the problem?

1349
01:57:58,700 --> 01:57:59,900
What?

1350
01:57:59,900 --> 01:58:01,300
Your sarcasm.

1351
01:58:01,400 --> 01:58:04,300
What is the problem
we have to solve?

1352
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,100
You stay here!

1353
01:58:13,300 --> 01:58:15,400
You'll only leave when I say so.

1354
01:58:24,600 --> 01:58:26,000
Fine.

1355
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:39,000
I was hoping to spare you this.

1356
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:46,400
At Uncle Edoardo's
I fell in love with a man.

1357
01:58:48,300 --> 01:58:50,100
He's from Lombardy.

1358
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:54,200
...and is a banker who advised
Uncle Edoardo financially.

1359
01:58:56,400 --> 01:58:58,200
He courted me assiduously.

1360
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:01,500
...and was very fond of the children.

1361
01:59:03,900 --> 01:59:07,300
It was thanks to him
that Sigi has blossomed.

1362
01:59:11,500 --> 01:59:13,500
Despite this, we came back.

1363
01:59:15,000 --> 01:59:17,000
Because I felt committed to you.

1364
01:59:20,200 --> 01:59:22,500
But I can't stand this place
any longer.

1365
01:59:23,500 --> 01:59:25,400
Not so much personally...

1366
01:59:26,100 --> 01:59:28,700
...though life with you.

1367
01:59:28,700 --> 01:59:31,200
...isn't thrilling
for a woman of my age.

1368
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:38,100
I'm leaving so the children
don't grow up in surroundings.

1369
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:41,300
...that are dominated by malice...

1370
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:43,700
...envy...

1371
01:59:44,300 --> 01:59:47,000
...apathy and brutality.

1372
01:59:50,900 --> 01:59:53,900
Sigi's whistle was the last straw.

1373
01:59:57,000 --> 01:59:59,000
I'm sick and tired of persecutions...

1374
01:59:59,900 --> 02:00:02,500
...threats
and perverse acts of revenge.

1375
02:00:09,000 --> 02:00:10,600
Did you sleep with him?

1376
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:14,800
You don't understand anything.

1377
02:00:15,400 --> 02:00:17,100
Did you sleep with him?

1378
02:00:23,200 --> 02:00:24,900
No. I didn't sleep with him.

1379
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,500
You're lying, right?

1380
02:00:37,300 --> 02:00:38,400
Come in!

1381
02:00:41,300 --> 02:00:42,700
Good evening.

1382
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:45,500
Good evening, Baroness.

1383
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:48,400
- Can I talk to you?
- Can't it wait?

1384
02:00:48,600 --> 02:00:51,900
No, or I wouldn't have
disturbed you so late.

1385
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:09,300
What is it?

1386
02:02:11,400 --> 02:02:14,500
They've assassinated
Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo.

1387
02:02:17,000 --> 02:02:20,300
The news spread around the village
like wildfire.

1388
02:02:21,200 --> 02:02:23,200
What would the consequences be?

1389
02:02:24,000 --> 02:02:27,600
The first who said "war",
was severely contradicted.

1390
02:02:28,800 --> 02:02:31,200
But once the word had been uttered,

1391
02:02:31,400 --> 02:02:35,800
it remained stubbornly
at the center of all our thoughts.

1392
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:41,500
I wanted to go to town quickly
to discuss with Eva

1393
02:02:41,700 --> 02:02:45,000
what we should do
if war broke out.

1394
02:02:45,700 --> 02:02:49,600
Maybe her father would now agreed
to an earlier marriage.

1395
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,600
I asked the Baroness for the bicycle

1396
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:56,400
that Eva had borrowed previously.

1397
02:02:57,300 --> 02:03:01,400
I planned to use it
to visit her Sunday.

1398
02:03:03,300 --> 02:03:07,600
Friday when I went to pick up
the bicycle,

1399
02:03:08,000 --> 02:03:11,400
I witnessed a strange confrontation.

1400
02:03:23,200 --> 02:03:24,900
What is it, Mrs Wagner?

1401
02:03:26,900 --> 02:03:28,200
Can I borrow your bicycle?

1402
02:03:28,500 --> 02:03:31,200
- It's not mine.
- Can I borrow it anyway?

1403
02:03:31,500 --> 02:03:34,800
I just borrowed it myself.
To visit my fiancée.

1404
02:03:35,100 --> 02:03:36,400
Please!

1405
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:38,800
Where do you want to go?

1406
02:03:39,100 --> 02:03:40,500
- To town.
- What for?

1407
02:03:40,800 --> 02:03:45,000
The stubborn steward
won't lend me a carriage.

1408
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:47,700
Please lend it to me.

1409
02:03:48,000 --> 02:03:49,700
Why? What for?

1410
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:53,400
To go to the police.
I know who committed those crimes.

1411
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:54,700
Who?

1412
02:03:55,600 --> 02:03:57,000
Can I have the bicycle?

1413
02:03:57,900 --> 02:03:59,300
Why not tell me?

1414
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:03,100
I'll only talk to the police.
I'm sick of insults.

1415
02:04:04,900 --> 02:04:06,800
What about the doctor's horse?

1416
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,800
I don't know how to ride.

1417
02:04:11,100 --> 02:04:14,000
Please! Believe me!

1418
02:04:14,200 --> 02:04:17,000
My son told me who did it to him.

1419
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:20,400
He may lose his eyesight.

1420
02:04:21,300 --> 02:04:22,900
Lend it to me!

1421
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:27,500
Thanks!

1422
02:04:31,200 --> 02:04:34,800
I was so sorry that I gave in.

1423
02:04:35,300 --> 02:04:37,700
But the state of that woman,

1424
02:04:37,700 --> 02:04:40,000
usually so level headed, upset me.

1425
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:44,900
What had she found out
that she didn't dare tell?

1426
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:49,700
Back in the village,
I decided to investigate.

1427
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:03,000
Hello, sir.

1428
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:04,800
Hello, Klara.

1429
02:05:07,300 --> 02:05:08,600
What are you doing here?

1430
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:12,900
We wanted to see how Karli was.

1431
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:16,400
Can't you see it's closed up?

1432
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,800
Yes. We were worried.

1433
02:05:19,200 --> 02:05:22,300
We saw Mrs Wagner
bicycling off.

1434
02:05:23,200 --> 02:05:25,300
We wondered
what had happened to Karli.

1435
02:05:29,300 --> 02:05:31,700
Go home.
You don't belong in here.

1436
02:05:46,300 --> 02:05:48,000
Go on home.

1437
02:05:49,200 --> 02:05:50,500
Good bye, teacher.

1438
02:05:57,600 --> 02:06:02,300
I wondered why the midwife
had closed the shutters.

1439
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,400
Nobody in the village
locked their house.

1440
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,200
Why had the midwife
locked in her son?

1441
02:06:09,600 --> 02:06:11,100
Karli, can you hear me?

1442
02:06:16,100 --> 02:06:18,900
I thought of Erna's dream again.

1443
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:21,000
What if Erna hadn't dreamt it,

1444
02:06:21,100 --> 02:06:23,900
but knew that Karli
would be tortured,

1445
02:06:24,500 --> 02:06:26,800
who had told her?

1446
02:06:27,200 --> 02:06:29,800
Who wouldn't she denounce?

1447
02:06:31,000 --> 02:06:34,900
The kids' interest in Karli
seemed strange to me.

1448
02:06:35,300 --> 02:06:39,000
Usually, because of his disability,

1449
02:06:39,000 --> 02:06:45,300
they had no contact with him,
or treated him disdainfully.

1450
02:06:46,500 --> 02:06:48,900
When the midwife
couldn't take care of him,

1451
02:06:49,200 --> 02:06:52,800
she entrusted him to me
or the doctor.

1452
02:06:53,100 --> 02:06:56,700
But since his mishap,
I hadn't seen him again.

1453
02:06:57,700 --> 02:07:01,000
Worried,
I decided to ask the doctor.

1454
02:07:01,300 --> 02:07:04,200
OFFICE CLOSED
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

1455
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:12,400
- Wasn't his daughter in school?
- Yes, she was.

1456
02:07:13,500 --> 02:07:15,100
And she said nothing?

1457
02:07:17,000 --> 02:07:18,200
I have a request...

1458
02:07:19,400 --> 02:07:21,400
Could I talk to Klara and Martin?

1459
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,400
Won't you wait for my husband?

1460
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:26,700
He's at the church.
The service is almost over.

1461
02:07:27,500 --> 02:07:29,500
But if you insist, please come in.

1462
02:07:31,400 --> 02:07:32,800
Be seated.

1463
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,200
I'll fetch them for you.

1464
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:13,200
Good evening, sir.

1465
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:16,500
Won't you sit down?

1466
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:18,800
Yes. Perhaps. With pleasure.

1467
02:08:19,700 --> 02:08:21,500
Can I offer you something?

1468
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:26,200
A coffee,
like during the piano lessons?

1469
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,600
Yes, with pleasure.
Very kind of you.

1470
02:08:30,800 --> 02:08:32,200
I'll be right back.

1471
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:40,300
Did you know the doctor
was leaving Eichwald?

1472
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:44,400
You're not surprised by my question?

1473
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:48,000
Our mother just told us.

1474
02:08:49,500 --> 02:08:51,800
Anna didn't tell you?

1475
02:08:55,200 --> 02:08:56,600
Not a word?

1476
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:01,400
It's odd not to say
you're going away on a trip.

1477
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:03,300
Anna doesn't say much.

1478
02:09:03,300 --> 02:09:05,100
But this was completely different.

1479
02:09:08,100 --> 02:09:10,100
You're hiding something from me.

1480
02:09:10,500 --> 02:09:11,500
What?

1481
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:14,300
I'm waiting for you to tell me.

1482
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:20,700
When you looked for Karli...

1483
02:09:20,700 --> 02:09:22,500
what did you want from him?

1484
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:24,800
We were worried. He's ill.

1485
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:26,900
I'm asking Martin.

1486
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:30,100
Yes. He isn't well.

1487
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:32,500
And since his mother was leaving.

1488
02:09:33,100 --> 02:09:35,700
we thought we'd pay him a visit.

1489
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:47,800
Did you ever wonder
who mistreated Karli?

1490
02:09:49,500 --> 02:09:51,000
And Sigi?

1491
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:55,800
Who tied the wire
to trip the doctor?

1492
02:09:56,000 --> 02:09:57,900
Who set fire to the barn?

1493
02:09:59,600 --> 02:10:00,700
No?

1494
02:10:00,800 --> 02:10:02,200
Of course, we wondered.

1495
02:10:02,500 --> 02:10:03,600
Well?

1496
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:07,400
Father said
it must be a sick person.

1497
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:15,600
Sigi was with you at Thanksgiving.
And Karli always went along.

1498
02:10:16,300 --> 02:10:17,500
I don't understand.

1499
02:10:17,500 --> 02:10:18,700
No?

1500
02:10:25,700 --> 02:10:26,900
What did they do wrong?

1501
02:10:28,200 --> 02:10:30,300
- Who?
- Sigi and Karli.

1502
02:10:30,500 --> 02:10:31,700
Why?

1503
02:10:31,800 --> 02:10:34,600
They obviously were being punished.
For what?

1504
02:10:34,700 --> 02:10:35,900
I don't know.

1505
02:10:36,200 --> 02:10:39,100
Erna foresaw that Karli
would be punished. What for?

1506
02:10:39,400 --> 02:10:40,600
I don't know!

1507
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:44,300
Why ask us?

1508
02:10:44,300 --> 02:10:47,900
You're a smart girl, Klara.
Don't play dumb.

1509
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:51,900
I don't understand.

1510
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:55,600
Talk about this
with Father or Mother.

1511
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:57,400
Shall I get them?

1512
02:10:57,600 --> 02:10:59,000
Martin, will you go?

1513
02:10:59,100 --> 02:11:00,900
Stay here, Martin.

1514
02:11:01,200 --> 02:11:03,900
I'll see them later.
Now, I'm talking to you.

1515
02:11:04,100 --> 02:11:06,600
Tell me the truth.

1516
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:09,200
- Where were you when Karli was...
- Here.

1517
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:11,800
I mean, after the confirmation?

1518
02:11:12,800 --> 02:11:14,400
Coffee's coming.

1519
02:11:19,000 --> 02:11:20,800
Could the children help you?

1520
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:25,300
I'm afraid not. They know nothing.

1521
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:29,800
His daughter said nothing at school?

1522
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:31,600
No.

1523
02:11:32,900 --> 02:11:34,300
Sorry I disturbed you.

1524
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:39,000
Stay! My husband is coming,
and the coffee is almost ready.

1525
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:42,900
Thanks, but I'm worried
about the midwife's son.

1526
02:11:44,900 --> 02:11:48,100
- She didn't say when she'd be back?
- I didn't ask her.

1527
02:11:48,900 --> 02:11:51,400
She caught me off guard.
She was panicked.

1528
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:53,600
Wait, I hear my husband.

1529
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:57,200
Good evening.

1530
02:11:58,500 --> 02:12:00,400
The teacher was waiting for you.

1531
02:12:01,200 --> 02:12:03,600
Yes. I'd like a word with you.

1532
02:12:03,900 --> 02:12:07,300
Please. Let's go to my study.
It's quieter.

1533
02:12:12,300 --> 02:12:14,300
What's this about?

1534
02:12:17,100 --> 02:12:19,300
I spoke to the midwife:

1535
02:12:19,500 --> 02:12:22,300
...she said she knew
who tortured her son.

1536
02:12:23,600 --> 02:12:27,600
She'll only tell the police,
and went to town.

1537
02:12:30,300 --> 02:12:31,300
Well?

1538
02:12:32,800 --> 02:12:36,500
She left the boy behind alone
and locked the house.

1539
02:12:37,800 --> 02:12:39,200
Locked it?

1540
02:12:41,700 --> 02:12:43,900
I went to ask the doctor.

1541
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:46,300
...if he was caring
for the child, but...

1542
02:12:48,200 --> 02:12:51,400
...there's a paper saying
that the office is closed.

1543
02:12:51,700 --> 02:12:54,200
He and his kids have disappeared.

1544
02:12:54,600 --> 02:12:55,800
What does it mean?

1545
02:12:56,000 --> 02:12:57,300
I don't know.

1546
02:12:58,000 --> 02:13:01,000
I thought you might know.
That's why I'm here.

1547
02:13:01,600 --> 02:13:02,700
I have no idea.

1548
02:13:04,300 --> 02:13:05,800
Please be seated.

1549
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:12,600
Wasn't his daughter in school?

1550
02:13:12,800 --> 02:13:15,600
Yes. She mentioned nothing.

1551
02:13:18,800 --> 02:13:22,500
I asked Klara and Martin.
They know nothing either.

1552
02:13:23,100 --> 02:13:24,500
Why should they?

1553
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:28,300
I don't know...

1554
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:33,600
I went to Mrs Wagner's place:
they and some others were there.

1555
02:13:34,000 --> 02:13:35,400
To do what?

1556
02:13:35,800 --> 02:13:37,300
They were looking for the boy.

1557
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:38,700
Why?

1558
02:13:39,300 --> 02:13:41,100
They wanted to help him.

1559
02:13:42,500 --> 02:13:43,600
So what?

1560
02:13:46,400 --> 02:13:48,300
I don't know how to say it...

1561
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:51,200
I think they're hiding something.

1562
02:13:51,300 --> 02:13:52,500
What?

1563
02:13:54,800 --> 02:13:56,100
I don't know.

1564
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:00,100
When the doctor had his accident...

1565
02:14:00,300 --> 02:14:02,000
...last year...

1566
02:14:03,200 --> 02:14:07,400
...they appeared in his garden.
Supposedly, to help Anna.

1567
02:14:09,400 --> 02:14:10,500
Yes... And?

1568
02:14:12,500 --> 02:14:14,600
Nothing. I had forgotten it.

1569
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:17,400
I just remembered today.

1570
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:20,000
I don't understand.

1571
02:14:21,800 --> 02:14:24,400
When the Baron's son was found...

1572
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:26,800
He'd been with the children
just before.

1573
02:14:30,300 --> 02:14:31,600
What are you getting at?

1574
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:34,900
The steward's daughter.

1575
02:14:35,300 --> 02:14:40,100
...predicted that Karli
would be beaten.

1576
02:14:40,400 --> 02:14:42,500
She says she dreamt it.

1577
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:44,900
The police think she's lying.

1578
02:14:45,700 --> 02:14:49,100
From whom did she find out?
Who told her?

1579
02:15:06,200 --> 02:15:09,400
You're saying that your pupils,
my children included...

1580
02:15:09,500 --> 02:15:12,500
...committed these crimes.
Is that right?

1581
02:15:16,500 --> 02:15:18,100
You realize what you're saying?

1582
02:15:19,200 --> 02:15:20,900
Do you really know...

1583
02:15:35,700 --> 02:15:37,700
I assume I'm the first person.

1584
02:15:38,800 --> 02:15:41,500
...to hear these monstrosities.

1585
02:15:43,900 --> 02:15:46,300
If you ever dare.

1586
02:15:47,100 --> 02:15:49,000
...to bother others with this...

1587
02:15:50,000 --> 02:15:51,700
...if you ever accuse.

1588
02:15:52,100 --> 02:15:54,800
...respectable families and their children.

1589
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:56,800
...and denounce them publicly...

1590
02:15:58,000 --> 02:16:01,200
I'll make sure, take my word for it...

1591
02:16:01,500 --> 02:16:03,100
...that you go to prison.

1592
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:08,400
I've seen a lot
during my work as a pastor...

1593
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:12,100
...but never anything so repulsive!

1594
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,600
One can tell you have no children.

1595
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:21,400
Or you wouldn't stoop
to such aberrations.

1596
02:16:23,900 --> 02:16:25,600
You have a sick mind.

1597
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:31,000
How did they let you loose
among those poor creatures!

1598
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:36,300
I'll speak to the authorities
about this.

1599
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:39,200
Now get out of my house!

1600
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:42,500
I don't want to see you here again.

1601
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,900
The midwife didn't come back.

1602
02:16:53,000 --> 02:16:56,200
I waited until morning,
two days later.

1603
02:16:56,500 --> 02:16:58,000
Then I went to the manor house

1604
02:16:58,100 --> 02:17:00,300
to inform the Baron.

1605
02:17:00,500 --> 02:17:03,700
He told the steward
and said to open the house

1606
02:17:03,700 --> 02:17:05,700
and take care of the disabled boy.

1607
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,200
I'll look upstairs.

1608
02:17:09,000 --> 02:17:11,700
I'd never been
in the midwife's house

1609
02:17:12,000 --> 02:17:13,300
and felt uncomfortable

1610
02:17:13,300 --> 02:17:17,300
barging into somebody else's place
without asking.

1611
02:17:19,000 --> 02:17:20,500
It was strange,

1612
02:17:21,300 --> 02:17:25,300
but while we still searched
and called out Karli's name,

1613
02:17:25,400 --> 02:17:28,600
I already knew
our search was in vain.

1614
02:17:29,300 --> 02:17:33,900
Anyone who knew how devoted
the midwife was to her son,

1615
02:17:34,200 --> 02:17:39,800
knew she'd never have abandoned
her wounded Karli.

1616
02:17:42,400 --> 02:17:44,200
During the next few weeks,

1617
02:17:44,300 --> 02:17:47,500
the village gossips worked overtime.

1618
02:17:48,200 --> 02:17:51,600
Some claimed the doctor
was Karli's father.

1619
02:17:51,900 --> 02:17:54,700
He and the midwife
had tried to abort the child

1620
02:17:54,700 --> 02:17:58,300
so their relationship
wouldn't be found out,

1621
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:02,200
and that's how
the child was disabled.

1622
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:05,000
Some even claimed

1623
02:18:05,000 --> 02:18:09,500
that the death of the doctor's wife
was suspect,

1624
02:18:09,500 --> 02:18:13,900
and the two might very well
be responsible for it.

1625
02:18:15,100 --> 02:18:17,100
Better still,
the doctor and the midwife,

1626
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:19,100
as potential murderers, y

1627
02:18:19,200 --> 02:18:23,700
had also perpetrated
all the other crimes.

1628
02:18:24,100 --> 02:18:27,000
Wanting to spare
his legitimate children and himself

1629
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:30,200
from public disclosure of his guilt,

1630
02:18:30,200 --> 02:18:33,400
the doctor had fled with them.

1631
02:18:34,900 --> 02:18:39,400
On July 28th,
Austria declared war on Serbia.

1632
02:18:39,600 --> 02:18:43,900
On Saturday, August 1st,
Germany declared war on Russia,

1633
02:18:43,900 --> 02:18:47,000
and on France the following Monday.

1634
02:18:48,600 --> 02:18:53,100
The solemn service next Sunday
was attended by the whole village.

1635
02:18:53,300 --> 02:18:57,100
A feeling of expectation
and departure was in the air.

1636
02:18:57,400 --> 02:19:00,000
Now everything was going to change.

1637
02:19:00,600 --> 02:19:04,200
Eva's father,
in the face of the coming war,

1638
02:19:04,400 --> 02:19:06,600
had taken his daughter back home,

1639
02:19:06,600 --> 02:19:10,300
and, at her pleading,
had come to Eichwald

1640
02:19:10,600 --> 02:19:15,500
where his future son-in-law lived
and worked, to look it over.

1641
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:20,700
The prospect of soon calling
this beloved creature my wife

1642
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:24,000
also made this a festive day for me.

1643
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:27,900
The pastor never mentioned
our conversation again.

1644
02:19:28,200 --> 02:19:33,000
And apparently never went through
with his threat to denounce me.

1645
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:37,300
I was drafted at the start of 1917.

1646
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:41,000
After the war,
as my father had died meanwhile,

1647
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:43,500
I sold his house in Vasendorf,

1648
02:19:43,800 --> 02:19:48,000
and with the money
opened a tailor's shop in town.

1649
02:19:48,300 --> 02:19:51,100
I never saw
any of the villagers again.
