1
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,126
Hello.

2
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,211
Hello, sweetie.

3
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:53,088
Daddy.

4
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,423
It's early.

5
00:02:54,548 --> 00:02:56,050
Yeah, I know.

6
00:02:56,133 --> 00:02:58,719
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

7
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,388
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

8
00:03:01,471 --> 00:03:02,597
No,

9
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,516
but it's sparkly.

10
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,769
Does it have a receipt?

11
00:03:07,852 --> 00:03:11,731
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

12
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:15,359
Why don't you just come by?

13
00:03:15,442 --> 00:03:17,111
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

14
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:19,613
Well, it'd be a long trip.

15
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:22,115
I'm in Venice.

16
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,578
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

17
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,914
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

18
00:03:29,956 --> 00:03:32,041
but we never really connected.

19
00:03:32,124 --> 00:03:34,919
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

20
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,587
What are you into, Dad?

21
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,796
Don't break my heart.

22
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,464
You told me you were through.

23
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:42,300
After this I am, I swear to you.

24
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:45,803
Is Charlie there?

25
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:47,597
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

26
00:03:47,638 --> 00:03:51,058
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

27
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:52,268
I love you.

28
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,936
Go back to sleep. Bye.

29
00:03:53,978 --> 00:03:55,437
D... Dad?

30
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:01,693
I love you, too.

31
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,826
I sent it.

32
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:11,452
You're supposed
to do your shopping

33
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:12,787
after we pull off the job.

34
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:13,996
I feel so optimistic.

35
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,331
So?

36
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:16,790
How do you feel?

37
00:04:16,832 --> 00:04:18,333
I'm fine.

38
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:19,668
Fine?

39
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,670
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

40
00:04:21,711 --> 00:04:23,296
Yeah, unfortunately.

41
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:24,547
"Freaked out."

42
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,632
-"lnsecure."
-"Neurotic."

43
00:04:25,715 --> 00:04:27,216
-And "Emotional."
-Good.

44
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,469
See those columns behind you?

45
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:32,304
What about them?

46
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,682
That's where they used
to string up thieves

47
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:35,683
who felt "fine."

48
00:04:35,724 --> 00:04:37,684
Well... after you.

49
00:04:45,108 --> 00:04:46,943
For after the haul.

50
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:49,695
Hope I get to fire it up.

51
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:51,364
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

52
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,573
No.

53
00:04:52,656 --> 00:04:53,574
If they're no-shows,

54
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,034
three months of prep
down the tubes

55
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:57,077
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

56
00:04:57,161 --> 00:04:58,829
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

57
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:01,498
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

58
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,084
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

59
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:05,668
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

60
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:06,836
Just remember, a police boat

61
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,880
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

62
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:10,881
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

63
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,174
Now, you told me ten,

64
00:05:12,216 --> 00:05:14,093
and you said I would have five.

65
00:05:14,176 --> 00:05:15,886
When?

66
00:05:18,055 --> 00:05:20,849
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

67
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:22,350
-I will kick your ass.
-Oh, yeah?

68
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:23,685
Come on, take your best shot.

69
00:05:23,727 --> 00:05:24,686
Come on.

70
00:05:24,727 --> 00:05:26,062
What? Uh-oh.

71
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:37,698
Come on.

72
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:38,865
Let's go.

73
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:40,367
What is it this time?

74
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,785
Da Vinci. Architect.

75
00:05:41,868 --> 00:05:43,078
Engineer. Painter.

76
00:05:43,119 --> 00:05:44,370
Yeah, fascinating.

77
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:45,538
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

78
00:05:45,622 --> 00:05:49,375
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

79
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,045
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

80
00:05:53,087 --> 00:05:54,380
Can we go? Please?

81
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:56,882
Right, guv'nor.

82
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,383
Come along,
make yourself useful.

83
00:05:58,425 --> 00:05:59,634
Untie that line.

84
00:05:59,718 --> 00:06:00,844
Today.

85
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,970
Yeah.

86
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:03,054
Yeah, Gilligan.

87
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:04,180
If you don't mind.

88
00:06:42,424 --> 00:06:43,550
-We set?
-Yeah. I've enhanced

89
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:45,844
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

90
00:06:45,927 --> 00:06:47,303
and three altitude angles,

91
00:06:47,387 --> 00:06:48,930
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

92
00:06:49,013 --> 00:06:50,598
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

93
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
We're in ltaly.

94
00:06:51,682 --> 00:06:52,933
Speak English.

95
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,685
Steve, how we looking?

96
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:59,314
Papa took the boat to work at
8:1 5, so the garage is empty.

97
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:03,735
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

98
00:07:03,818 --> 00:07:05,945
So for the next 45 minutes,

99
00:07:06,029 --> 00:07:07,780
we own this place, gentlemen.

100
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:10,157
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

101
00:07:10,241 --> 00:07:12,284
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

102
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:13,452
They'll be there.

103
00:07:13,494 --> 00:07:14,870
You can trust these guys.

104
00:07:14,954 --> 00:07:17,331
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

105
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:21,835
I trust everyone-- I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

106
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:11,005
We're in.

107
00:08:28,396 --> 00:08:30,398
Just tell me where to paint.

108
00:08:38,405 --> 00:08:40,115
Your men are still not
in position?

109
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,700
They will be.

110
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:43,743
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

111
00:08:43,827 --> 00:08:47,622
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

112
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:54,587
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

113
00:08:54,628 --> 00:08:55,796
This is our only shot at it.

114
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,509
Charlie?

115
00:09:02,135 --> 00:09:03,261
Keep going?

116
00:09:03,345 --> 00:09:05,263
It's up to you, kid.

117
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,265
It's a go.

118
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:12,061
Okay, Steve.

119
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:18,066
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

120
00:09:18,108 --> 00:09:19,276
Got it.

121
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:21,069
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

122
00:09:21,111 --> 00:09:22,696
from the north wall.

123
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:24,447
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

124
00:09:25,823 --> 00:09:26,866
Got it.

125
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,950
Well, it's right above you.

126
00:10:01,273 --> 00:10:02,315
Now, paint.

127
00:10:02,482 --> 00:10:05,735
Two feet, nine inches wide.

128
00:10:05,818 --> 00:10:07,904
Two feet, five inches deep.

129
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:10,156
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

130
00:10:11,574 --> 00:10:13,909
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

131
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:41,184
Yeah.

132
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:44,354
Bene.

133
00:10:45,647 --> 00:10:48,149
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

134
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:52,596
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

135
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,349
The police boat's
heading your way.

136
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:57,017
Seven minutes and counting.

137
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,393
Let's go.

138
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:21,052
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

139
00:14:55,918 --> 00:14:56,960
Whoa! Whoa!

140
00:17:31,727 --> 00:17:33,229
Hey, you guys. Come here.

141
00:17:37,024 --> 00:17:39,693
I want to propose a toast.

142
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:41,695
To us.

143
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:42,737
Yay!

144
00:17:46,074 --> 00:17:48,701
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

145
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:52,163
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

146
00:17:52,246 --> 00:17:54,123
without even holding a gun

147
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,833
because he planned this
down to a "T '."

148
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:58,126
Nobody else
could have done that.

149
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,211
Nobody. Charlie!

150
00:17:59,294 --> 00:18:01,046
-Charlie!
-Yay!

151
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,839
Thank you.

152
00:18:02,922 --> 00:18:04,132
So, come on, gentlemen.

153
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:05,925
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

154
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:07,260
Spare no dirty details.

155
00:18:07,343 --> 00:18:08,636
Come on, you guys.

156
00:18:08,719 --> 00:18:10,888
Take a lesson from an old man.

157
00:18:10,972 --> 00:18:12,723
Don't spend it.
Invest.

158
00:18:14,225 --> 00:18:15,517
In what?

159
00:18:15,601 --> 00:18:17,436
In gold.

160
00:18:19,438 --> 00:18:20,772
Let's figure out

161
00:18:20,856 --> 00:18:22,983
how to get out of here first,
all right?

162
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,109
What are you getting, Rob?

163
00:18:25,193 --> 00:18:26,486
I don't know--
there's a lot of things

164
00:18:26,569 --> 00:18:27,653
you can buy with a lot of money.

165
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:29,447
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

166
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:30,698
in leather seats.

167
00:18:30,781 --> 00:18:32,241
Obviously. See?

168
00:18:32,324 --> 00:18:34,493
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

169
00:18:34,577 --> 00:18:35,828
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

170
00:18:35,911 --> 00:18:37,913
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

171
00:18:37,996 --> 00:18:39,664
I'm going to get a NAD T770

172
00:18:39,664 --> 00:18:39,706
I'm going to get a NAD T770

173
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,584
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

174
00:18:43,626 --> 00:18:44,502
Yeah.

175
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:45,670
It's a big stereo.

176
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,922
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

177
00:18:48,005 --> 00:18:49,173
Now you're talking.

178
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,260
$35 million-- you can't get
more creative than that, man?

179
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:55,512
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

180
00:18:55,596 --> 00:18:57,055
right there.

181
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,682
Get me a big house...

182
00:18:58,765 --> 00:19:00,392
get me a library
full of first editions.

183
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:01,768
Get a room for my shoes.

184
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,812
What about you, Steve?

185
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:06,231
I don't know--
I haven't decided yet.

186
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:08,107
You haven't decided yet?

187
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:10,026
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

188
00:19:10,109 --> 00:19:11,027
I liked what you said.

189
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,570
I'll take one of each of yours.

190
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,864
Well, well, two of everything

191
00:19:15,948 --> 00:19:17,366
-for Steve then.
-Two of those.

192
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:18,450
Oy!

193
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:25,540
Loved the toast.

194
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,792
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

195
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,211
No, you were incredible.

196
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,712
Just incredible.

197
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,214
You saw the whole picture.

198
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:34,548
You covered all the angles.

199
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,384
You know, Charlie,

200
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,554
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

201
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,223
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

202
00:19:43,306 --> 00:19:47,226
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

203
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:49,228
Don't be the latter.

204
00:19:49,312 --> 00:19:51,397
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

205
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,232
in this life.

206
00:19:53,315 --> 00:19:55,734
What are you talking about,
John?

207
00:19:55,818 --> 00:19:57,236
You've been a good father.

208
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,906
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

209
00:20:00,989 --> 00:20:03,491
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

210
00:20:03,575 --> 00:20:07,537
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

211
00:20:07,578 --> 00:20:11,582
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

212
00:20:11,665 --> 00:20:13,709
and hold onto her forever.

213
00:20:13,792 --> 00:20:16,837
-Okay?
-Hey.

214
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:18,922
Let's go--
I'm freezing my ass off.

215
00:20:19,006 --> 00:20:21,258
Yeah.

216
00:20:21,341 --> 00:20:23,259
Steve's getting cold.

217
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:24,761
You, too?

218
00:20:24,844 --> 00:20:25,929
I'm all right.

219
00:20:27,347 --> 00:20:28,598
I love you, kid.

220
00:20:28,681 --> 00:20:30,057
You did really great.

221
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:32,601
Thanks, John.

222
00:20:32,685 --> 00:20:36,063
Let's go.

223
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,448
# Money #

224
00:20:47,532 --> 00:20:50,076
# It's a gas #

225
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:57,332
# Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash #

226
00:20:57,457 --> 00:21:00,877
# New car, caviar,
four-star daydream... #

227
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:02,754
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

228
00:21:02,796 --> 00:21:04,422
He was like Don Johnson.

229
00:21:04,506 --> 00:21:06,549
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

230
00:21:06,591 --> 00:21:08,718
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

231
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:17,768
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

232
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,353
What's this, what's this?

233
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:24,315
Who the hell are these guys?

234
00:21:28,111 --> 00:21:28,778
Hey!

235
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:29,946
Take your hands off the wheel.

236
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:30,696
Steve!

237
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:35,993
Don't even think about it--
just do it.

238
00:21:41,373 --> 00:21:42,249
No, no, no, no,

239
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,500
-no, no, no, no, John.
-Steve,

240
00:21:43,583 --> 00:21:44,501
what the hell are you doing?

241
00:21:44,584 --> 00:21:45,960
Made a few plans of my own.

242
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:51,632
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

243
00:21:51,674 --> 00:21:52,633
You know that.

244
00:21:52,675 --> 00:21:53,926
I think that's probably right,
John.

245
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:55,511
Go! Go!

246
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:42,901
Charlie.

247
00:23:42,984 --> 00:23:45,945
We got to go, Charlie.

248
00:25:09,772 --> 00:25:11,440
You always work in the dark?

249
00:25:11,482 --> 00:25:14,151
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

250
00:25:16,528 --> 00:25:17,487
Not bad.

251
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,239
Not bad, Stella.

252
00:25:19,323 --> 00:25:21,074
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

253
00:25:21,158 --> 00:25:22,367
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

254
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,368
who to call first.

255
00:25:23,451 --> 00:25:24,411
You're expensive, Stella.

256
00:25:24,494 --> 00:25:27,246
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

257
00:25:27,372 --> 00:25:29,040
Good will, community service.

258
00:25:29,123 --> 00:25:31,208
I do it for the money, Paul.

259
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:32,793
I'll be sending you a bill.

260
00:25:32,835 --> 00:25:34,670
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

261
00:25:34,712 --> 00:25:35,754
I never look inside.

262
00:25:36,797 --> 00:25:38,423
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

263
00:25:38,507 --> 00:25:39,508
Hi, Stella.

264
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:42,510
# I came, I saw, I kicked some ass #

265
00:25:42,552 --> 00:25:45,722
# The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh #

266
00:25:45,805 --> 00:25:47,473
# 'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange #

267
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:50,226
# Time, time for this girl
to sing #

268
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:53,020
# Damn if I thought
that you would change #

269
00:25:53,103 --> 00:25:55,272
# And my life would stay
the same #

270
00:25:55,356 --> 00:25:57,733
# Things will come
and things will go #

271
00:25:57,816 --> 00:26:00,152
# And one thing I know
for sure #

272
00:26:00,193 --> 00:26:04,155
# Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning #

273
00:26:04,239 --> 00:26:05,823
# I'm walking out the door #

274
00:26:05,907 --> 00:26:09,160
# Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning #

275
00:26:09,202 --> 00:26:10,995
# Oh, it's time... #

276
00:26:14,498 --> 00:26:15,416
How long to crack it?

277
00:26:15,499 --> 00:26:17,876
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

278
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,877
Oh! You're the man!

279
00:26:18,961 --> 00:26:19,961
What's on the lineup?

280
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,171
Todd Milliken called.

281
00:26:21,213 --> 00:26:22,756
He has a prototype
combination lock.

282
00:26:22,839 --> 00:26:24,174
He wants you to test out.

283
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:25,341
He says he added

284
00:26:25,425 --> 00:26:28,386
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

285
00:26:28,469 --> 00:26:30,221
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

286
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:31,430
give him a thrill.

287
00:26:31,514 --> 00:26:33,724
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

288
00:26:34,892 --> 00:26:37,019
Says you two know each other.

289
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,857
Charlie Croker.

290
00:26:42,899 --> 00:26:44,442
Hey, Stella.

291
00:26:47,445 --> 00:26:49,447
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

292
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:53,075
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

293
00:26:53,159 --> 00:26:54,576
right in front of your eyes,

294
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,537
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

295
00:27:01,458 --> 00:27:02,959
We found him, Stella.

296
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:05,753
He's in Los Angeles.

297
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:06,879
The gold bricks he stole from us

298
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:08,297
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

299
00:27:08,381 --> 00:27:09,590
I just got word,

300
00:27:09,674 --> 00:27:11,050
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

301
00:27:11,092 --> 00:27:13,427
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

302
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:15,137
Yeah?

303
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,597
Well, how do you know it's him?

304
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,392
Skinny Pete sent me this.

305
00:27:20,434 --> 00:27:22,602
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

306
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:30,610
Why you telling me
all of this?

307
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,862
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

308
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,488
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

309
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:35,989
delivered to his home office.

310
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,491
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

311
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:39,159
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

312
00:27:39,242 --> 00:27:40,243
No, you don't.

313
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:41,244
The problem now is no one

314
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,579
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

315
00:27:42,621 --> 00:27:44,747
And I need somebody
I can trust.

316
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,416
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

317
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:47,750
I'm not a thief.

318
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,669
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

319
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:50,962
John was like a father
to me, too.

320
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:57,968
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

321
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,970
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

322
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,602
I've moved on.

323
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:13,370
Come on, Charlie.

324
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:15,497
Come on.

325
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,712
Hello?

326
00:29:22,754 --> 00:29:24,631
I want to see the look
on that man's face

327
00:29:24,714 --> 00:29:26,049
when his gold is gone.

328
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,260
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

329
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:34,723
She's in.

330
00:29:34,807 --> 00:29:36,433
That's a good thing?

331
00:29:36,517 --> 00:29:37,559
It's a very good thing.

332
00:29:37,643 --> 00:29:39,519
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

333
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:41,062
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

334
00:29:41,146 --> 00:29:42,188
a good idea, Charlie.

335
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,231
She's got the skill

336
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:44,399
and she's got the motivation.

337
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,900
Exactly.

338
00:29:45,984 --> 00:29:47,193
She's emotional.

339
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,529
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

340
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,155
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

341
00:29:51,238 --> 00:29:52,615
We're all emotional on this one.

342
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:54,908
Let's go.

343
00:29:54,992 --> 00:29:56,535
Are you ready?

344
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:57,703
Of course I am.

345
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:01,873
You're not ready.

346
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,606
That was quick.

347
00:30:28,689 --> 00:30:29,732
Where are they?

348
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,025
We're a little early.

349
00:30:31,108 --> 00:30:33,694
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

350
00:30:34,862 --> 00:30:35,904
There.

351
00:30:35,988 --> 00:30:37,072
That's Lyle.

352
00:30:37,114 --> 00:30:38,740
He's my computer genius.

353
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:46,247
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

354
00:30:46,289 --> 00:30:47,707
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

355
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,918
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

356
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,795
and stole his idea.

357
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:07,725
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

358
00:31:10,478 --> 00:31:11,437
Hey.

359
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:14,481
Oh...

360
00:31:15,858 --> 00:31:17,151
You okay?

361
00:31:18,568 --> 00:31:19,986
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

362
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:22,155
That's Left Ear.

363
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:24,240
Demolition and explosives.

364
00:31:24,324 --> 00:31:25,241
When he was ten,

365
00:31:25,366 --> 00:31:27,201
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

366
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:29,912
Fire...

367
00:31:29,996 --> 00:31:31,664
Whoa.

368
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:32,832
Yeah, that was cool.

369
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:34,124
How'd you do that?

370
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:35,209
What?!

371
00:31:35,292 --> 00:31:36,585
How'd you do that?

372
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:37,628
What?!

373
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:40,088
I said,
how did you do that?

374
00:31:40,172 --> 00:31:42,507
What?!

375
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,217
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

376
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,469
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

377
00:31:49,430 --> 00:31:51,140
Handsome Rob.

378
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:52,266
Premier wheel man.

379
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:53,726
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

380
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:55,686
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

381
00:32:04,569 --> 00:32:06,779
# You're a heartbreaker... #
-You know, he got 1 1 0

382
00:32:06,863 --> 00:32:08,197
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

383
00:32:08,281 --> 00:32:09,865
from women
who saw him on the news?

384
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:12,118
# You're a heartbreaker #

385
00:32:12,201 --> 00:32:13,661
# Dream-maker #

386
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:14,703
# Love-taker #

387
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:16,789
# Don't you mess around,
no, no, no... #

388
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,961
And you?

389
00:32:23,044 --> 00:32:25,505
I never heard
how you got your start.

390
00:32:25,588 --> 00:32:27,715
Me?

391
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:30,509
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

392
00:32:30,551 --> 00:32:33,637
Okay, you both know what to do.

393
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:35,097
Cough it up, now!

394
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,059
# Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho! #

395
00:32:39,101 --> 00:32:41,061
# One, two, three, baby... #

396
00:32:41,895 --> 00:32:43,063
Watch it, spaz!

397
00:32:43,146 --> 00:32:44,856
# Hey, now, do, re, me, baby... #

398
00:32:44,898 --> 00:32:45,899
Hey, what's your problem, man?

399
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,401
# A-B-C, it's easy #

400
00:32:48,484 --> 00:32:50,236
# As one, two, three... #

401
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,238
Hey, Charlie.

402
00:32:52,321 --> 00:32:53,447
Good to see you, man.

403
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:54,698
-Looking good.
-Yeah?

404
00:32:54,782 --> 00:32:57,201
-Charlie Hustle.
-Good to see you.

405
00:32:57,242 --> 00:32:58,201
Hello, Charlie.

406
00:32:58,243 --> 00:32:59,870
Rob, what's up?
Good?

407
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:01,413
Guys...

408
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:02,580
Stella Bridger.

409
00:33:02,664 --> 00:33:04,916
Hi.

410
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:05,917
How you doing?

411
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,085
Nice to meet you.

412
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:08,211
Phones?

413
00:33:08,294 --> 00:33:09,462
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

414
00:33:09,545 --> 00:33:10,963
I got internal chips in them.

415
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:12,131
Please change them twice a day.

416
00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:13,924
We will get heat on line.

417
00:33:14,008 --> 00:33:15,217
I.D.s?

418
00:33:17,761 --> 00:33:19,096
"James Hymen?"

419
00:33:19,137 --> 00:33:21,389
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

420
00:33:21,431 --> 00:33:23,600
140 pounds? Try 165.

421
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:24,934
Try lifting some weights.

422
00:33:25,018 --> 00:33:26,436
-Try lifting up these.
-Guys, enough.

423
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:27,937
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

424
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,938
Let's go.

425
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:30,106
Hey, Charlie...

426
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,234
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

427
00:33:33,275 --> 00:33:36,487
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

428
00:33:37,946 --> 00:33:40,073
# Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear #

429
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:44,744
# But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset #

430
00:33:44,828 --> 00:33:47,663
# No, no #

431
00:33:47,747 --> 00:33:50,249
# It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind #

432
00:33:50,374 --> 00:33:51,667
# And you can't go wrong #

433
00:33:51,751 --> 00:33:56,463
# 'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha! #

434
00:33:56,547 --> 00:33:59,049
# California soul #

435
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,760
# Ooh-ooh-ooh #

436
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:05,847
# California soul... #

437
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,599
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

438
00:34:08,641 --> 00:34:10,309
this joker picked Hollywood.

439
00:34:10,393 --> 00:34:12,645
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

440
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:14,188
All right...

441
00:34:14,313 --> 00:34:16,065
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

442
00:34:16,148 --> 00:34:17,858
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

443
00:34:17,941 --> 00:34:20,068
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

444
00:34:20,152 --> 00:34:21,611
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

445
00:34:21,695 --> 00:34:23,154
I crack into the phone company's

446
00:34:23,196 --> 00:34:24,989
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

447
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,074
there's a legal tap on the line.

448
00:34:26,157 --> 00:34:27,116
Just reroute the digital copies

449
00:34:27,158 --> 00:34:28,659
of the calls to our own
listening post.

450
00:34:28,701 --> 00:34:30,077
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

451
00:34:30,161 --> 00:34:31,620
How long?

452
00:34:31,662 --> 00:34:33,289
No-- how long will it take?

453
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:34,915
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

454
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:36,708
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

455
00:34:39,669 --> 00:34:40,921
Sorry I'm late.

456
00:34:41,004 --> 00:34:42,797
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

457
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:44,507
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

458
00:34:44,591 --> 00:34:47,051
Five minutes flat.

459
00:34:47,135 --> 00:34:48,594
Don't be cocky, young lady.

460
00:34:48,678 --> 00:34:50,805
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

461
00:34:52,181 --> 00:34:53,807
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

462
00:34:53,849 --> 00:34:55,351
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

463
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:56,477
whole different ball game.

464
00:34:58,061 --> 00:35:00,021
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

465
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:02,857
Look, just remember,

466
00:35:02,941 --> 00:35:03,983
this is all the easy part, okay?

467
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,318
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

468
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:06,527
So what's the sketch?

469
00:35:06,611 --> 00:35:07,653
We drive to Union Station.

470
00:35:07,695 --> 00:35:10,531
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

471
00:35:10,573 --> 00:35:12,158
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

472
00:35:12,324 --> 00:35:14,326
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

473
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:46,522
Oh, great.

474
00:35:46,564 --> 00:35:47,899
Carson Security System.

475
00:35:47,982 --> 00:35:49,859
How good is it?

476
00:35:49,901 --> 00:35:51,569
Carson's held
an annual contest--

477
00:35:51,652 --> 00:35:54,196
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

478
00:35:54,363 --> 00:35:56,782
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

479
00:35:56,865 --> 00:36:00,035
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

480
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:02,704
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

481
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,080
It's an anti-scaling fence.

482
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:06,082
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

483
00:36:06,165 --> 00:36:08,167
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

484
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:09,335
with some nitromin.

485
00:36:09,418 --> 00:36:10,670
Security on the property?

486
00:36:10,753 --> 00:36:12,088
Got an armed guard here.

487
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:13,172
Little rent-a-cop,

488
00:36:13,255 --> 00:36:14,673
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

489
00:36:14,757 --> 00:36:16,133
But that booth...

490
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:19,136
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

491
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:20,595
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

492
00:36:20,637 --> 00:36:22,764
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

493
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,641
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

494
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,186
Shit.

495
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:30,980
This dude got dogs.

496
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,857
I don't do dogs.

497
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,401
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

498
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,735
What happened?

499
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:40,030
I had a bad experience.

500
00:36:40,113 --> 00:36:41,823
Damn it. I'm deaf.

501
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:58,213
You turn in your badge

502
00:36:58,338 --> 00:37:00,382
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

503
00:37:00,465 --> 00:37:02,759
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

504
00:37:03,802 --> 00:37:04,761
Crush.

505
00:37:04,803 --> 00:37:05,803
I don't want to see you

506
00:37:05,887 --> 00:37:08,097
anywhere near
this investigation.

507
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,975
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

508
00:37:11,058 --> 00:37:11,976
I don't want to see you

509
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:13,602
anywhere near
this investigation.

510
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:18,023
Hey! It's a green!

511
00:37:18,106 --> 00:37:20,650
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

512
00:37:20,734 --> 00:37:22,527
-Green!
-I don't want to see you

513
00:37:22,611 --> 00:37:23,319
anywhere near this...

514
00:37:24,696 --> 00:37:25,947
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

515
00:37:28,658 --> 00:37:31,494
Unbelievable.

516
00:37:43,129 --> 00:37:45,089
There he is.

517
00:38:03,857 --> 00:38:06,484
Let's get to work.

518
00:38:08,861 --> 00:38:12,990
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

519
00:38:13,032 --> 00:38:14,491
slit-your-wrist traffic.

520
00:38:14,533 --> 00:38:16,785
You know, five people died
from smoking

521
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,161
in between traffic lights today.

522
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:20,163
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

523
00:38:20,205 --> 00:38:21,540
You could always use that.

524
00:38:21,581 --> 00:38:22,707
That'd be ideal

525
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,709
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

526
00:38:25,752 --> 00:38:26,919
What's your guesstimate?

527
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:29,505
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

528
00:38:29,547 --> 00:38:32,675
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

529
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:34,677
but if we had green
lights all the way,

530
00:38:34,718 --> 00:38:36,345
we could do it in 1 4 minutes.

531
00:38:36,386 --> 00:38:38,555
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

532
00:38:41,933 --> 00:38:42,851
Whoa.

533
00:38:44,310 --> 00:38:47,688
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

534
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,607
Lyle?

535
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,525
Lyle?

536
00:38:52,902 --> 00:38:54,403
I'll see what I can do.

537
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,742
You're right on time.

538
00:39:05,997 --> 00:39:07,790
All these poor bastards
out there,

539
00:39:07,874 --> 00:39:09,625
putting their life
savings in banks,

540
00:39:09,709 --> 00:39:11,627
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

541
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:13,963
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

542
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:15,798
they can depend
on the government?

543
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:17,132
I don't think so.

544
00:39:17,257 --> 00:39:18,592
Are you taping me?

545
00:39:18,634 --> 00:39:20,302
Of course not.

546
00:39:20,385 --> 00:39:22,053
I never tape you--
come look,

547
00:39:22,095 --> 00:39:23,221
see for yourself.

548
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:28,810
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

549
00:39:28,893 --> 00:39:32,396
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

550
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:34,565
Like my cousin Mashkov

551
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,734
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby--

552
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:40,779
gold."

553
00:39:46,909 --> 00:39:49,996
Every time I look
at these engravings...

554
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:52,832
She's so beautiful.

555
00:39:52,915 --> 00:39:55,000
Where'd you say you got these?

556
00:39:55,084 --> 00:39:56,210
I didn't.

557
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:04,092
A little walking around money.

558
00:40:14,351 --> 00:40:16,311
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

559
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:17,354
I'm... sorry.

560
00:40:17,437 --> 00:40:18,897
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

561
00:40:18,981 --> 00:40:20,857
-That wasn't the agreement.
-What can I say?

562
00:40:20,941 --> 00:40:22,192
I'm just middleman.

563
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:24,527
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

564
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,070
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

565
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:38,206
So, what does a man

566
00:40:38,332 --> 00:40:41,251
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

567
00:40:43,962 --> 00:40:46,506
He watches his big-ass TV.

568
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:51,093
That's our in.

569
00:41:13,781 --> 00:41:14,698
Stella.

570
00:41:14,782 --> 00:41:16,700
Jesus!

571
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:18,535
Charlie!

572
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:20,036
How did you get in here?

573
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:21,538
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

574
00:41:21,621 --> 00:41:24,040
What-- so you just
let yourself in?

575
00:41:24,124 --> 00:41:25,333
I was just making sure
you were okay.

576
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,709
I apologize. I just...

577
00:41:27,794 --> 00:41:29,629
-l...
-Don't look.

578
00:41:33,924 --> 00:41:35,259
Okay.

579
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,679
You got a lot of stuff here.

580
00:41:39,721 --> 00:41:42,641
You know,
your dad was old school.

581
00:41:42,724 --> 00:41:44,601
Did the whole thing by touch.

582
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:46,686
That worked for him;
this works for me.

583
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:49,730
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

584
00:41:49,814 --> 00:41:52,316
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

585
00:41:53,943 --> 00:41:55,903
Why the headphones?

586
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:57,738
Just training myself.

587
00:41:57,779 --> 00:42:00,407
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

588
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:05,078
What do you want, Charlie?

589
00:42:06,412 --> 00:42:07,997
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

590
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:09,707
and we need to send in
a repairman.

591
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,168
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

592
00:42:12,293 --> 00:42:13,669
Yep.

593
00:42:13,752 --> 00:42:16,421
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

594
00:42:18,757 --> 00:42:19,883
Except me.

595
00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:24,721
I'll do it, Charlie.

596
00:42:24,804 --> 00:42:28,266
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

597
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:30,768
All right.

598
00:42:30,851 --> 00:42:32,353
I'll set it up.

599
00:42:32,436 --> 00:42:33,520
Okay.

600
00:42:33,604 --> 00:42:35,064
Um... you, um...

601
00:42:35,147 --> 00:42:36,732
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

602
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:37,858
before I go back to my room?

603
00:42:40,444 --> 00:42:43,863
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

604
00:42:43,947 --> 00:42:45,990
Just get it all done tonight.

605
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:47,700
Yeah.

606
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:48,910
Sorry I scared you.

607
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:50,995
It's okay.

608
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:52,663
Good night.

609
00:42:53,747 --> 00:42:55,541
Bye.

610
00:42:55,624 --> 00:42:58,210
And then he's just...
the media darling.

611
00:42:58,293 --> 00:42:59,878
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

612
00:42:59,961 --> 00:43:02,130
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

613
00:43:02,297 --> 00:43:03,131
You know what he said?

614
00:43:03,298 --> 00:43:04,632
He said he...
he named it Napster

615
00:43:04,674 --> 00:43:05,925
because it-it was his nickname,

616
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:07,969
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

617
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,137
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

618
00:43:10,221 --> 00:43:12,139
when he stole it from me!

619
00:43:12,306 --> 00:43:14,808
He didn't even graduate.

620
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:17,811
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

621
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:18,812
They shut him down.

622
00:43:18,895 --> 00:43:21,856
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

623
00:43:22,899 --> 00:43:24,067
Here... here we go.

624
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,526
Cable chick.

625
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:38,163
Becky.

626
00:43:38,246 --> 00:43:39,831
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

627
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:40,832
the other one.

628
00:43:40,916 --> 00:43:42,167
And it's such a mystery

629
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,085
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

630
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,671
So, all we need is a...

631
00:43:46,754 --> 00:43:48,005
service truck like that one,

632
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:50,091
a work shirt like hers.

633
00:43:51,175 --> 00:43:52,510
You think Stella
can pull it off?

634
00:43:52,551 --> 00:43:54,011
I have my doubts.

635
00:43:54,094 --> 00:43:56,221
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

636
00:43:57,389 --> 00:44:00,183
You think he's...

637
00:44:00,267 --> 00:44:02,686
mixing business with pleasure?

638
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:04,979
He should know better.

639
00:44:05,063 --> 00:44:06,689
Only I'm allowed to do that.

640
00:44:08,524 --> 00:44:11,152
Right. Where you going?

641
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:13,529
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

642
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,247
Are you kidding me?

643
00:44:28,376 --> 00:44:30,461
How does he do that?

644
00:44:30,544 --> 00:44:31,504
How do you do that?

645
00:44:31,545 --> 00:44:32,796
What are you saying?

646
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,298
Hey, how are you?

647
00:44:34,381 --> 00:44:35,758
Oh, good. I'm good.

648
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:38,677
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

649
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:40,053
And you are...?

650
00:44:40,137 --> 00:44:41,513
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

651
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:42,931
but it's written on my shirt.

652
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:46,017
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

653
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,560
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

654
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,854
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

655
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:51,397
If it's on the menu.

656
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,023
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

657
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,858
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

658
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,860
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

659
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:57,861
No.

660
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,112
Perfect.

661
00:46:45,251 --> 00:46:46,961
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

662
00:46:47,045 --> 00:46:48,296
The cable's out.

663
00:46:48,379 --> 00:46:49,839
The TV, the modem, everything.

664
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:52,174
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

665
00:46:57,971 --> 00:46:59,765
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

666
00:46:59,848 --> 00:47:02,225
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

667
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:03,935
just gone out--
our modem, everything.

668
00:47:04,018 --> 00:47:05,603
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

669
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:07,647
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

670
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:08,815
if that would be good.

671
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:10,441
That's going to work. Thank you.

672
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:13,152
Guard just called
the cable company.

673
00:47:14,403 --> 00:47:16,530
What time's the appointment?

674
00:47:16,613 --> 00:47:18,532
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

675
00:47:27,874 --> 00:47:28,791
Hello?

676
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,209
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

677
00:47:30,293 --> 00:47:31,627
I understand your service
is out,

678
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:33,379
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

679
00:47:33,462 --> 00:47:34,380
Yes.

680
00:47:34,463 --> 00:47:35,714
Well, we have
a technician working

681
00:47:35,798 --> 00:47:37,341
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

682
00:47:37,424 --> 00:47:38,383
earlier than expected.

683
00:47:38,425 --> 00:47:39,968
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

684
00:47:40,051 --> 00:47:41,303
Sure, that'd be great.

685
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:43,763
All right, our technician
will see you then.

686
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:44,806
Have a nice day.

687
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:47,975
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

688
00:47:48,059 --> 00:47:50,978
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

689
00:47:51,062 --> 00:47:53,522
Let's check out the camera.

690
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:59,611
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

691
00:48:01,696 --> 00:48:03,073
Make sure you walk slowly,

692
00:48:03,114 --> 00:48:04,574
or the image will streak.

693
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:05,575
-Ow.
-Ooh.

694
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:07,118
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

695
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:09,870
Sorry... Couldn't pin

696
00:48:09,954 --> 00:48:11,414
the corsage
on my prom date either.

697
00:48:11,497 --> 00:48:12,414
But you had a prom date?

698
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:14,625
It was his cousin.

699
00:48:14,708 --> 00:48:16,210
There's cable lines

700
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,086
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

701
00:48:18,170 --> 00:48:20,005
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

702
00:48:20,088 --> 00:48:22,465
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

703
00:48:24,509 --> 00:48:25,552
Okay.

704
00:48:25,635 --> 00:48:27,261
Just want you to know

705
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,513
I think you're very
brave going in there.

706
00:48:28,596 --> 00:48:29,513
I know it won't be easy.

707
00:48:29,597 --> 00:48:31,348
I second that.

708
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,060
It's going to be fine.

709
00:48:36,395 --> 00:48:37,938
What?

710
00:48:38,021 --> 00:48:40,023
You know what fine stands for?

711
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:41,066
Freaked Out. Insecure...

712
00:48:41,149 --> 00:48:44,235
Neurotic, and Emotional.

713
00:48:49,073 --> 00:48:50,241
You'll be great.

714
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:51,450
Yeah.

715
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:04,420
Morning.

716
00:49:04,462 --> 00:49:05,713
Can I see some l.D.?

717
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,391
Thanks for coming so soon.

718
00:49:17,474 --> 00:49:18,934
Hey, that's part of the job.

719
00:49:18,975 --> 00:49:20,477
All right.

720
00:49:51,297 --> 00:49:53,716
Aston Martin Vanquish.

721
00:49:53,799 --> 00:49:57,511
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

722
00:50:00,222 --> 00:50:02,974
Nasty-ass dogs.

723
00:50:03,058 --> 00:50:05,810
Hey! Hey!

724
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:12,733
Relax,

725
00:50:12,817 --> 00:50:14,943
Jesus Christ.

726
00:50:15,027 --> 00:50:17,237
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

727
00:50:18,322 --> 00:50:20,448
Come on.

728
00:50:22,033 --> 00:50:23,660
House.

729
00:50:23,701 --> 00:50:25,703
Go on, get out of here.

730
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:31,834
It's okay,

731
00:50:31,876 --> 00:50:34,545
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

732
00:50:37,965 --> 00:50:39,216
Steve Frazelli.

733
00:50:40,884 --> 00:50:42,302
Becky.

734
00:50:45,388 --> 00:50:47,306
Want to show me that problem?

735
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:49,016
Yeah, of course.

736
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,309
This way.

737
00:50:51,394 --> 00:50:53,187
You have a really nice house.

738
00:50:53,229 --> 00:50:55,522
Yeah. 1922.

739
00:50:55,564 --> 00:50:58,191
All the original tiles.

740
00:50:58,233 --> 00:50:59,860
Every stone in that courtyard

741
00:50:59,901 --> 00:51:02,654
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

742
00:51:02,737 --> 00:51:04,114
What a tactic.

743
00:51:04,197 --> 00:51:05,490
Monastery?

744
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:07,909
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

745
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,536
You don't seem impressed.

746
00:51:10,619 --> 00:51:12,955
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

747
00:51:13,038 --> 00:51:15,624
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

748
00:51:15,707 --> 00:51:17,960
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

749
00:51:18,043 --> 00:51:20,295
What does do it for you?

750
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:23,631
Um... TVs?

751
00:51:23,715 --> 00:51:25,425
I have a monster TV.

752
00:51:26,509 --> 00:51:27,718
Not working right now, but...

753
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,470
But you know, I should
probably check out

754
00:51:29,554 --> 00:51:31,138
the cable modem, you know.

755
00:51:31,263 --> 00:51:32,640
Yeah? Yeah, right.

756
00:51:32,723 --> 00:51:34,183
Over here.

757
00:51:36,268 --> 00:51:39,646
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

758
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,147
One day, it just goes out.

759
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:44,859
I ought to have him strung up.

760
00:51:47,695 --> 00:51:48,613
Here we go.

761
00:51:48,654 --> 00:51:49,614
There's our baby.

762
00:51:50,656 --> 00:51:52,158
We got him.

763
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:54,076
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

764
00:51:54,118 --> 00:51:55,702
There's no wiring in here.

765
00:51:58,914 --> 00:51:59,998
Just right here?

766
00:52:00,081 --> 00:52:00,999
Yeah.

767
00:52:01,082 --> 00:52:02,876
Look at that, that's my...

768
00:52:02,959 --> 00:52:04,794
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

769
00:52:04,836 --> 00:52:06,796
That's my stereo.

770
00:52:06,838 --> 00:52:08,339
I bet most of your customers

771
00:52:08,422 --> 00:52:10,633
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

772
00:52:10,716 --> 00:52:12,259
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

773
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:13,552
Oh, yeah.

774
00:52:13,636 --> 00:52:15,471
He's hitting on her.

775
00:52:15,554 --> 00:52:16,638
There's no problem here.

776
00:52:16,722 --> 00:52:18,348
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

777
00:52:19,850 --> 00:52:21,685
Okay.

778
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:25,980
You know what,
end this shit right now.

779
00:52:26,022 --> 00:52:26,981
I'm going to blow this shit

780
00:52:27,023 --> 00:52:28,483
right off the mountain
right now.

781
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:30,484
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

782
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,949
I see you got the AVM processor.

783
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:38,825
Only the best.

784
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:40,827
Check the box.

785
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:49,377
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

786
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:53,339
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

787
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,007
That should do it.

788
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,009
It's fixed?

789
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,511
Turn her on, let's see.

790
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:00,637
Now.

791
00:53:03,181 --> 00:53:04,724
Japan's Nikkei index...

792
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,267
Perfect.

793
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:08,603
...was the ending price

794
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,438
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

795
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:12,940
Becky, huh?

796
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,901
Have we met before?

797
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:18,111
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

798
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,946
No, I don't think so.

799
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,448
If you can just sign there.

800
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,826
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

801
00:53:24,909 --> 00:53:26,577
would I be the first
one of your customers

802
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:27,787
to ever do that?

803
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:30,873
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

804
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:32,958
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

805
00:53:33,042 --> 00:53:34,126
had a handlebar mustache.

806
00:53:34,209 --> 00:53:35,294
You know, not really my type.

807
00:53:35,377 --> 00:53:37,838
I don't think it's a good idea.

808
00:53:37,921 --> 00:53:40,132
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

809
00:53:40,257 --> 00:53:42,967
No, actually, it's just my rule.

810
00:53:43,051 --> 00:53:44,719
I don't go out
with strange men.

811
00:53:44,802 --> 00:53:47,722
I just met you five minutes ago.

812
00:53:47,805 --> 00:53:50,224
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

813
00:53:50,308 --> 00:53:52,143
till we get to know each other
well enough.

814
00:53:54,395 --> 00:53:55,896
Have a nice day.

815
00:53:55,979 --> 00:53:57,898
Come on,

816
00:53:57,981 --> 00:53:59,399
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

817
00:53:59,441 --> 00:54:00,984
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

818
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,068
I'll just... I'll meet you.

819
00:54:02,152 --> 00:54:04,654
Anywhere you want to go.

820
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:08,658
Come on, break your rule once.

821
00:54:09,742 --> 00:54:11,452
It's just dinner.

822
00:54:16,498 --> 00:54:19,000
Is that a yes?

823
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:31,595
Are you okay?

824
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:34,098
Yeah.

825
00:54:34,181 --> 00:54:36,308
He touched my hand.

826
00:54:38,352 --> 00:54:41,146
He came on to me.

827
00:54:44,023 --> 00:54:45,942
Hey, at least l...

828
00:54:46,025 --> 00:54:48,611
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

829
00:54:50,696 --> 00:54:53,449
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

830
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:55,284
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

831
00:54:55,367 --> 00:54:57,119
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

832
00:54:57,202 --> 00:54:59,037
Yeah.

833
00:55:00,205 --> 00:55:02,749
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

834
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,751
Hey, Lyle,

835
00:55:04,792 --> 00:55:07,086
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

836
00:55:07,128 --> 00:55:08,421
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

837
00:55:08,463 --> 00:55:10,923
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

838
00:55:10,965 --> 00:55:12,174
Lyle!

839
00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:14,468
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

840
00:55:14,551 --> 00:55:15,761
No.

841
00:55:15,803 --> 00:55:17,930
I'm not calling you The Napster.

842
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:19,264
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

843
00:55:19,306 --> 00:55:20,265
Well, I am.

844
00:55:20,307 --> 00:55:22,225
And him, Handsome Rob.

845
00:55:22,309 --> 00:55:23,852
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

846
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:26,396
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

847
00:55:26,396 --> 00:55:28,940
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

848
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:31,192
Why are you encouraging this?

849
00:55:31,233 --> 00:55:33,027
It is a verifiable fact--

850
00:55:33,068 --> 00:55:35,487
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

851
00:55:35,571 --> 00:55:37,322
I am The Napster.

852
00:55:38,407 --> 00:55:41,201
All right, all right.

853
00:55:41,284 --> 00:55:42,494
What is the distance

854
00:55:42,577 --> 00:55:45,371
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

855
00:55:47,165 --> 00:55:49,542
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

856
00:55:49,584 --> 00:55:51,585
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

857
00:55:51,669 --> 00:55:53,504
from the vault
to the getaway car?

858
00:55:53,587 --> 00:55:56,089
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

859
00:56:01,261 --> 00:56:02,846
Six feet.

860
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:21,947
Okay, you've got your gold.

861
00:56:43,633 --> 00:56:44,759
Whoo!

862
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,962
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

863
00:57:24,045 --> 00:57:26,339
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

864
00:57:26,422 --> 00:57:28,341
with the custom work, too.

865
00:57:28,424 --> 00:57:29,759
I know a man for the job.

866
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:32,803
So I modified the camera
to include the...

867
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:35,639
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

868
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:36,765
Who's that?

869
00:57:36,849 --> 00:57:38,684
Rob's mechanic friend.

870
00:57:43,354 --> 00:57:44,647
-Hey, Charlie.
-Hey.

871
00:57:44,689 --> 00:57:46,357
Charlie, this is Wrench.

872
00:57:46,441 --> 00:57:47,900
Hey, what's up, man?

873
00:57:47,984 --> 00:57:49,652
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

874
00:57:49,735 --> 00:57:51,195
We need some body work done.

875
00:57:51,278 --> 00:57:55,657
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

876
00:57:55,741 --> 00:57:57,034
with enough suspension
and horsepower

877
00:57:57,117 --> 00:57:59,119
to outrun anything chasing us.

878
00:57:59,202 --> 00:58:00,996
2,700 pounds of what?

879
00:58:01,037 --> 00:58:03,289
Of whatever.

880
00:58:05,375 --> 00:58:07,460
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

881
00:58:07,543 --> 00:58:08,961
1 0,000.

882
00:58:10,963 --> 00:58:12,631
All right.

883
00:58:23,099 --> 00:58:25,101
# What comes around... #

884
00:58:38,697 --> 00:58:41,032
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

885
00:58:41,074 --> 00:58:42,951
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

886
00:58:43,034 --> 00:58:44,536
Wrench.

887
00:58:45,745 --> 00:58:47,538
Ham and cheese.

888
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,248
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

889
00:58:49,332 --> 00:58:51,417
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

890
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,629
# What comes around #

891
00:58:57,673 --> 00:59:00,175
# Just comes around #

892
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:16,815
# What comes around #

893
00:59:20,277 --> 00:59:21,152
# What comes around... #

894
00:59:36,917 --> 00:59:38,168
You want all greens?

895
00:59:38,251 --> 00:59:39,586
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

896
00:59:40,629 --> 00:59:41,713
What have you got?

897
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:44,090
Welcome to L.A.'s
Automated Traffic Surveillance

898
00:59:44,174 --> 00:59:46,259
and Control Operations Center.

899
00:59:46,342 --> 00:59:48,094
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

900
00:59:48,177 --> 00:59:49,387
and specifically designed
algorithms

901
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:51,138
to predict traffic conditions,

902
00:59:51,222 --> 00:59:52,890
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

903
00:59:52,932 --> 00:59:54,892
all I did was come up
with my own

904
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:57,352
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

905
00:59:57,436 --> 00:59:59,104
and now we own the place.

906
00:59:59,187 --> 01:00:00,147
You want to do a dry run?

907
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,898
I thought you'd never ask.

908
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:04,984
See, red light?

909
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,027
Green light.

910
01:00:11,615 --> 01:00:12,658
-Danielson?
-Yeah?

911
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:13,742
What's up with Grid 34?

912
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:15,702
Let's check it out.

913
01:00:15,786 --> 01:00:17,162
Hey, hey.

914
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:19,081
Oh, oops, did l...?

915
01:00:19,122 --> 01:00:21,625
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

916
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:23,585
-Can you change it back now?
-Yeah.

917
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:30,257
Lights are working fine.

918
01:00:30,299 --> 01:00:32,635
Just an accident.

919
01:00:33,928 --> 01:00:34,887
That's good.

920
01:00:36,430 --> 01:00:38,098
What are those?

921
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:40,058
Unnecessary engine parts.

922
01:00:40,142 --> 01:00:43,812
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

923
01:00:43,895 --> 01:00:46,773
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

924
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:47,940
# Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off #

925
01:00:48,065 --> 01:00:49,150
# And never getting lost #

926
01:00:49,233 --> 01:00:50,693
# Which way will I turn
when roads cross? #

927
01:00:50,776 --> 01:00:52,444
# Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary #

928
01:00:52,528 --> 01:00:54,488
# But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor #

929
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:55,781
# Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off #

930
01:00:55,823 --> 01:00:57,449
# And never getting lost #

931
01:00:57,532 --> 01:00:59,159
# Which way will I turn
when roads cross? #

932
01:00:59,242 --> 01:01:01,369
# Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary #

933
01:01:01,453 --> 01:01:03,830
# But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor #

934
01:01:03,872 --> 01:01:06,457
# Won't stop driving
till it's over #

935
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:12,630
# Still be cruising
when the sun goes down #

936
01:01:12,671 --> 01:01:15,132
# Won't stop driving
till it's over #

937
01:01:15,174 --> 01:01:16,884
# Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off #

938
01:01:16,967 --> 01:01:18,302
# And never getting lost #

939
01:01:18,343 --> 01:01:19,886
# Which way will I turn
when roads cross? #

940
01:01:20,011 --> 01:01:22,389
# Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary #

941
01:01:22,472 --> 01:01:25,266
# But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor... #

942
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:31,897
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

943
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:34,316
The look on Steve's face.

944
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:46,202
You're early.

945
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,870
I'm in a hurry.

946
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:51,999
Of course, you know
that the Florida

947
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:54,293
vote rigging was a ClA
and mob operation.

948
01:01:54,376 --> 01:01:55,294
Is that so?

949
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:56,587
Yeah, which is not
so very different

950
01:01:56,670 --> 01:01:57,838
from when your John F. Kennedy

951
01:01:57,921 --> 01:02:00,632
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

952
01:02:00,715 --> 01:02:02,217
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

953
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,844
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

954
01:02:04,886 --> 01:02:06,721
You Americans.

955
01:02:06,804 --> 01:02:08,514
You love your heroes.

956
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:11,434
A holiday for Columbus?

957
01:02:11,517 --> 01:02:13,394
He makes the wrong turn,

958
01:02:13,435 --> 01:02:15,896
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

959
01:02:15,979 --> 01:02:17,189
And you know
what he was looking for?

960
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:18,857
I bet you're going to tell me.

961
01:02:18,982 --> 01:02:20,025
Gold.

962
01:02:20,108 --> 01:02:21,901
Supposedly for Queen lsabella,

963
01:02:22,027 --> 01:02:23,736
but don't think that
the Medicis back in ltaly

964
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:25,321
didn't want a part
of that action.

965
01:02:25,405 --> 01:02:27,615
And what did ltaly
need gold for?

966
01:02:27,698 --> 01:02:32,036
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

967
01:02:32,077 --> 01:02:33,370
Venice...
that's where

968
01:02:33,412 --> 01:02:35,372
these bricks...

969
01:02:40,585 --> 01:02:41,628
You were saying something?

970
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:43,213
Nothing... No...

971
01:02:43,254 --> 01:02:44,380
No, you were really
on a roll there.

972
01:02:44,464 --> 01:02:45,840
Don't stop. I'm interested.

973
01:02:45,923 --> 01:02:47,800
Please, I'm confused,
my English--

974
01:02:50,177 --> 01:02:51,095
You understand fine.

975
01:02:51,178 --> 01:02:52,388
Now what do you know
about my gold?

976
01:02:52,471 --> 01:02:53,430
No, I don't--

977
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,557
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

978
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:58,643
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

979
01:02:58,727 --> 01:03:01,229
about a heist in Venice.

980
01:03:01,271 --> 01:03:03,565
35 million in bricks,

981
01:03:03,606 --> 01:03:05,942
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

982
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:07,527
-Who have you told?
-No one.

983
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,528
Who have you told?

984
01:03:08,611 --> 01:03:10,571
No one!
I swear to God!

985
01:03:12,573 --> 01:03:13,699
You swear to God?

986
01:03:13,782 --> 01:03:16,201
You crazy?
I swear to God.

987
01:03:16,285 --> 01:03:17,244
I didn't!

988
01:03:18,787 --> 01:03:20,038
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

989
01:03:49,982 --> 01:03:51,400
Yevhen?

990
01:03:53,611 --> 01:03:55,112
Yevhen?

991
01:04:12,128 --> 01:04:13,295
Let's putt it this time...

992
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,632
Putt, not drive.

993
01:04:16,673 --> 01:04:18,008
Very good.

994
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:19,301
If you can just get it,

995
01:04:19,384 --> 01:04:21,344
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

996
01:04:21,386 --> 01:04:22,679
Much better.

997
01:04:22,721 --> 01:04:24,764
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

998
01:04:24,848 --> 01:04:26,099
Yeah, he's over there.

999
01:04:26,182 --> 01:04:27,725
Thanks, man.

1000
01:04:30,227 --> 01:04:31,645
-Don't stare.
-Huh?

1001
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:32,771
Don't stare.

1002
01:04:32,855 --> 01:04:34,189
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

1003
01:04:34,231 --> 01:04:35,190
Stare at what?

1004
01:04:36,525 --> 01:04:37,818
That was good.
That was good.

1005
01:04:37,859 --> 01:04:39,486
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

1006
01:04:40,737 --> 01:04:42,864
That was great.

1007
01:04:42,947 --> 01:04:44,657
-Skinny Pete.
-Yo, Charlie.

1008
01:04:44,699 --> 01:04:45,867
What's up, man?

1009
01:04:46,034 --> 01:04:47,285
How's it going?

1010
01:04:47,368 --> 01:04:49,870
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

1011
01:04:49,996 --> 01:04:51,872
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

1012
01:04:51,914 --> 01:04:54,208
some supplies.

1013
01:04:54,249 --> 01:04:55,209
Baby, go relax.

1014
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,210
Baby...

1015
01:04:56,251 --> 01:04:57,628
Go relax.

1016
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:04,676
Yo.

1017
01:05:04,759 --> 01:05:06,719
Yo.

1018
01:05:06,803 --> 01:05:08,429
Supplies.

1019
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:09,347
What's wrong?

1020
01:05:09,388 --> 01:05:10,514
Huh?

1021
01:05:10,556 --> 01:05:13,183
Uh... um, some, uh,

1022
01:05:13,267 --> 01:05:14,393
some nitromin,

1023
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:16,145
uh...

1024
01:05:16,228 --> 01:05:17,646
some, uh...

1025
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:19,940
some nitromin, primer...

1026
01:05:20,023 --> 01:05:21,399
-What's wrong?
-Huh?

1027
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:21,858
Yo.

1028
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,026
Uh, nothing.

1029
01:05:23,068 --> 01:05:24,027
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

1030
01:05:24,068 --> 01:05:25,695
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

1031
01:05:25,778 --> 01:05:27,738
Nitromin, primer,

1032
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:29,031
-detonating cord...
-Right, right.

1033
01:05:29,115 --> 01:05:31,200
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

1034
01:05:31,242 --> 01:05:34,036
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

1035
01:05:34,078 --> 01:05:35,829
All right.

1036
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,378
Cost you about five G's.

1037
01:05:43,461 --> 01:05:45,421
Done. Call me.

1038
01:05:46,673 --> 01:05:48,174
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

1039
01:05:48,257 --> 01:05:50,051
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

1040
01:05:50,092 --> 01:05:51,927
-Peace.
-Come on.

1041
01:06:09,569 --> 01:06:11,362
Get out.

1042
01:06:11,987 --> 01:06:13,197
There.

1043
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:24,207
Vance has something
to tell you.

1044
01:06:27,585 --> 01:06:28,711
Go on.

1045
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:33,090
A couple weeks back...

1046
01:06:34,675 --> 01:06:37,302
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

1047
01:06:37,386 --> 01:06:40,096
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

1048
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:41,973
dancer on them.

1049
01:06:42,015 --> 01:06:43,475
What did you tell him?

1050
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:47,520
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

1051
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:54,610
I'm sorry.

1052
01:06:55,944 --> 01:06:58,447
What did this man look like?

1053
01:06:59,656 --> 01:07:00,657
He had, uh...

1054
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,075
Iong black hair,

1055
01:07:02,158 --> 01:07:04,119
big tattoo on his neck.

1056
01:07:06,537 --> 01:07:09,749
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

1057
01:07:09,832 --> 01:07:11,125
I know that guy.

1058
01:07:39,568 --> 01:07:41,236
Baby, go relax.

1059
01:07:52,413 --> 01:07:53,998
Do you know who I am?

1060
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:56,542
You're Mashkov.

1061
01:07:56,583 --> 01:07:58,502
That's right.

1062
01:07:58,543 --> 01:08:01,171
You were asking
about gold bricks

1063
01:08:01,254 --> 01:08:02,922
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

1064
01:08:03,965 --> 01:08:05,466
Tell me why.

1065
01:08:12,723 --> 01:08:14,099
Steve just called to confirm

1066
01:08:14,183 --> 01:08:16,143
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

1067
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,561
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

1068
01:08:17,644 --> 01:08:20,397
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

1069
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:22,440
Safe popped by 8:25.

1070
01:08:22,524 --> 01:08:24,901
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

1071
01:08:24,984 --> 01:08:26,527
Straight to Union Station.

1072
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,904
Only green lights on your route.

1073
01:08:27,987 --> 01:08:29,155
The rest of the city's red.

1074
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:30,823
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

1075
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:31,949
Train leaves at 1 0:00.

1076
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:34,201
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

1077
01:08:34,284 --> 01:08:36,286
Timing's got to be dead on.

1078
01:08:36,370 --> 01:08:37,621
Let's get ready.

1079
01:08:37,704 --> 01:08:39,122
Let's get it.

1080
01:09:10,109 --> 01:09:12,778
Wow, that is a nice car.

1081
01:09:12,945 --> 01:09:14,571
Sorry, Rob.

1082
01:09:14,655 --> 01:09:15,864
Coast is clear, guys.

1083
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:28,668
This is it, guys.

1084
01:09:28,751 --> 01:09:29,710
Moment of truth.

1085
01:09:31,420 --> 01:09:32,546
What the hell is this?

1086
01:09:34,840 --> 01:09:36,717
Shit!

1087
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,760
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

1088
01:09:42,180 --> 01:09:43,765
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

1089
01:09:43,848 --> 01:09:45,642
No.

1090
01:09:48,144 --> 01:09:50,104
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

1091
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:51,814
Too many witnesses.

1092
01:09:51,939 --> 01:09:52,940
Stella.

1093
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,734
I know, I know.

1094
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,404
I'm late for my date.

1095
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:02,115
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

1096
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,825
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

1097
01:10:03,950 --> 01:10:05,201
Sorry.

1098
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:07,870
Let's get out of the street.

1099
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,792
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

1100
01:10:13,834 --> 01:10:15,544
What's that supposed to mean?

1101
01:10:15,627 --> 01:10:17,170
Well, you don't really seem

1102
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:21,007
Iike the adventurous type,
you know?

1103
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:24,385
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

1104
01:10:24,469 --> 01:10:27,597
I wasn't making assumptions.

1105
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:29,056
I've made some
assumptions about you.

1106
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,809
Oh, really?

1107
01:10:31,892 --> 01:10:32,977
And?

1108
01:10:36,188 --> 01:10:38,231
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

1109
01:10:44,195 --> 01:10:46,364
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

1110
01:10:46,447 --> 01:10:47,657
Let's go back to my place.

1111
01:10:47,698 --> 01:10:48,699
No assumptions...

1112
01:10:48,741 --> 01:10:50,284
Not tonight.
It's late.

1113
01:10:50,368 --> 01:10:51,327
I should go home.

1114
01:10:51,368 --> 01:10:54,413
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

1115
01:10:54,496 --> 01:10:55,456
No,

1116
01:10:55,539 --> 01:10:58,875
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

1117
01:10:58,959 --> 01:11:00,168
Hey.

1118
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:02,420
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

1119
01:11:02,504 --> 01:11:05,215
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation--

1120
01:11:05,298 --> 01:11:06,341
you still don't trust me?

1121
01:11:06,382 --> 01:11:10,177
Oh, I trust everyone.

1122
01:11:10,219 --> 01:11:13,555
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

1123
01:11:18,018 --> 01:11:19,770
It's an interesting saying.

1124
01:11:19,853 --> 01:11:21,229
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

1125
01:11:22,731 --> 01:11:23,690
Can't remember.

1126
01:11:23,731 --> 01:11:25,275
Really?

1127
01:11:25,358 --> 01:11:27,527
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

1128
01:11:27,568 --> 01:11:28,694
Really?

1129
01:11:28,736 --> 01:11:31,155
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

1130
01:11:31,238 --> 01:11:33,198
He said it all the time.

1131
01:11:33,282 --> 01:11:34,408
His name was John Bridger.

1132
01:11:35,784 --> 01:11:38,120
You're hurting my wrist.

1133
01:11:38,203 --> 01:11:40,580
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

1134
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:46,753
Let go of my wrist.

1135
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:48,754
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

1136
01:11:48,796 --> 01:11:51,966
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

1137
01:11:52,049 --> 01:11:54,718
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

1138
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,637
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

1139
01:11:59,347 --> 01:12:01,558
Who are you working with?

1140
01:12:06,312 --> 01:12:07,980
She's with us.

1141
01:12:19,783 --> 01:12:20,992
Gang's all here.

1142
01:12:21,076 --> 01:12:23,828
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

1143
01:12:23,912 --> 01:12:25,455
A coward.

1144
01:12:25,538 --> 01:12:26,581
Then you should have seen

1145
01:12:26,622 --> 01:12:28,291
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

1146
01:12:31,961 --> 01:12:32,920
It's not worth it.

1147
01:12:33,003 --> 01:12:34,088
Put a leash on your cat.

1148
01:12:39,718 --> 01:12:40,719
Hi, Steve.

1149
01:12:40,802 --> 01:12:42,053
Charlie.

1150
01:12:43,805 --> 01:12:45,682
Not bad, Charlie.

1151
01:12:45,765 --> 01:12:46,766
Really, not bad.

1152
01:12:46,808 --> 01:12:48,935
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

1153
01:12:49,018 --> 01:12:50,770
not to reach across
this table and kill you

1154
01:12:50,811 --> 01:12:52,188
with my bare hands.

1155
01:12:52,271 --> 01:12:53,731
You know better than that,
Charlie.

1156
01:12:53,814 --> 01:12:56,275
Can't let emotion
into these things.

1157
01:12:56,358 --> 01:12:57,442
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

1158
01:12:57,526 --> 01:12:59,194
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

1159
01:12:59,277 --> 01:13:00,987
That wasn't about emotion.

1160
01:13:01,071 --> 01:13:03,281
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

1161
01:13:03,364 --> 01:13:05,241
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

1162
01:13:05,325 --> 01:13:07,785
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

1163
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:09,453
'cause I just don't give a shit.

1164
01:13:09,537 --> 01:13:10,996
Okay?

1165
01:13:11,080 --> 01:13:13,749
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

1166
01:13:13,832 --> 01:13:16,293
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

1167
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:18,086
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

1168
01:13:18,170 --> 01:13:19,921
that's fine with me.

1169
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:24,217
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

1170
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,177
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

1171
01:13:26,260 --> 01:13:29,180
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

1172
01:13:29,263 --> 01:13:32,183
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

1173
01:13:32,266 --> 01:13:34,560
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

1174
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:35,936
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

1175
01:13:36,019 --> 01:13:38,855
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

1176
01:13:38,939 --> 01:13:40,774
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

1177
01:13:40,857 --> 01:13:42,817
come in and try
to crack my safe?

1178
01:13:42,859 --> 01:13:46,195
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

1179
01:13:46,279 --> 01:13:47,822
but I just don't see it.

1180
01:13:47,905 --> 01:13:49,282
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

1181
01:13:49,365 --> 01:13:50,991
Same old Steve, huh?

1182
01:13:51,075 --> 01:13:53,410
Always thinking defensively.

1183
01:13:53,494 --> 01:13:55,162
That's why you're
always number two.

1184
01:13:55,245 --> 01:13:57,331
How do you figure that?

1185
01:13:57,372 --> 01:13:58,874
You got no imagination.

1186
01:13:58,915 --> 01:14:01,251
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

1187
01:14:01,334 --> 01:14:03,336
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

1188
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:05,797
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

1189
01:14:05,880 --> 01:14:06,964
That gold is already gone.

1190
01:14:07,048 --> 01:14:08,674
That's bullshit, Steve.

1191
01:14:08,758 --> 01:14:10,718
No, really, it's over Charlie.

1192
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,720
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

1193
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:15,347
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

1194
01:14:15,431 --> 01:14:17,516
I mean, really, be my guest.

1195
01:14:17,557 --> 01:14:19,309
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

1196
01:14:19,392 --> 01:14:20,519
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

1197
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:21,519
you had going for you.

1198
01:14:21,561 --> 01:14:23,646
You just blew the element
of surprise.

1199
01:14:27,567 --> 01:14:28,901
Surprised?

1200
01:14:32,238 --> 01:14:33,322
It's over when I say it's over.

1201
01:14:37,284 --> 01:14:39,327
Are you all right, sir?

1202
01:15:11,148 --> 01:15:12,233
How you doing?

1203
01:15:14,443 --> 01:15:17,237
Good...

1204
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,031
considering...

1205
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:22,450
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

1206
01:15:22,534 --> 01:15:23,785
for a man I barely knew.

1207
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:36,129
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

1208
01:15:36,213 --> 01:15:39,633
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

1209
01:15:39,716 --> 01:15:41,676
that he was on some job,

1210
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:45,305
I knew you were right there
with him.

1211
01:15:48,474 --> 01:15:51,143
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

1212
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:55,022
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

1213
01:15:55,105 --> 01:15:56,773
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

1214
01:15:56,815 --> 01:15:59,192
Be nice if it was true.

1215
01:15:59,276 --> 01:16:00,527
It is true.

1216
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:02,487
He always regretted
not having been

1217
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:04,572
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

1218
01:16:07,450 --> 01:16:08,868
How do you know that?

1219
01:16:08,951 --> 01:16:11,328
Because he told me.

1220
01:16:18,001 --> 01:16:19,252
What did you do to your hand?

1221
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:24,591
I punched Steve.

1222
01:16:24,674 --> 01:16:27,927
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

1223
01:16:31,013 --> 01:16:32,348
Those hands are
way too valuable.

1224
01:16:40,355 --> 01:16:41,690
Hey.

1225
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,196
Okay?

1226
01:16:57,871 --> 01:16:59,498
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

1227
01:17:06,045 --> 01:17:09,006
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

1228
01:17:09,090 --> 01:17:10,299
Charlie!

1229
01:17:12,968 --> 01:17:14,011
He's flying the coop.

1230
01:17:15,345 --> 01:17:16,513
When?

1231
01:17:16,555 --> 01:17:18,056
His security guard called

1232
01:17:18,098 --> 01:17:20,267
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

1233
01:17:20,350 --> 01:17:22,936
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

1234
01:17:23,019 --> 01:17:26,773
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

1235
01:17:26,856 --> 01:17:27,774
to Mexico City.

1236
01:17:27,857 --> 01:17:31,277
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

1237
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,028
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

1238
01:17:33,112 --> 01:17:35,197
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

1239
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,365
It's going to be in that truck

1240
01:17:36,448 --> 01:17:37,699
and he's going to be watching it

1241
01:17:37,741 --> 01:17:39,451
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

1242
01:17:39,534 --> 01:17:41,244
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

1243
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:42,287
Who knows where?

1244
01:17:42,370 --> 01:17:43,455
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

1245
01:17:43,538 --> 01:17:44,455
Slow down, slow down.

1246
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:45,415
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

1247
01:17:45,456 --> 01:17:46,499
This is good news for us.

1248
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:48,793
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

1249
01:17:48,918 --> 01:17:50,711
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

1250
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:51,962
now the safe is coming to us.

1251
01:17:52,046 --> 01:17:53,380
We're going to boost it
in transit.

1252
01:17:53,422 --> 01:17:54,381
Charlie, it could take

1253
01:17:54,423 --> 01:17:55,549
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

1254
01:17:55,632 --> 01:17:57,342
We have no idea which one.

1255
01:17:57,426 --> 01:17:59,636
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

1256
01:17:59,719 --> 01:18:00,679
We're already set up to do it.

1257
01:18:00,762 --> 01:18:02,138
Napster,

1258
01:18:02,222 --> 01:18:06,225
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

1259
01:18:06,309 --> 01:18:08,519
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

1260
01:18:08,603 --> 01:18:09,729
Where do we want it to go?

1261
01:18:09,895 --> 01:18:12,398
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

1262
01:18:12,439 --> 01:18:14,858
We do it like the ltalian job.

1263
01:18:21,072 --> 01:18:22,073
Hello?

1264
01:18:22,115 --> 01:18:23,408
Why'd you do it?

1265
01:18:23,450 --> 01:18:24,284
Do what?

1266
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,076
Yevhen.

1267
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:26,869
You didn't have to clip him.

1268
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:27,912
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

1269
01:18:27,954 --> 01:18:28,913
We didn't clip anybody.

1270
01:18:28,955 --> 01:18:29,997
Yevhen's cousin is under

1271
01:18:30,081 --> 01:18:32,750
the distinct impression
that you did.

1272
01:18:32,791 --> 01:18:33,876
Why does he think that?

1273
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:35,085
Because you want to know

1274
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:37,129
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

1275
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:38,422
You told him that?

1276
01:18:38,505 --> 01:18:39,756
Listen to me, man.

1277
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:41,675
If there's one thing that I know

1278
01:18:41,758 --> 01:18:43,718
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

1279
01:18:43,802 --> 01:18:46,346
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

1280
01:18:46,429 --> 01:18:49,974
Look, I need a favor.

1281
01:19:15,998 --> 01:19:17,082
Yeah.

1282
01:19:17,165 --> 01:19:18,250
Had a hiccup last night.

1283
01:19:18,333 --> 01:19:19,251
Could use some help.

1284
01:19:19,334 --> 01:19:20,418
Want hands-on this time.

1285
01:19:20,502 --> 01:19:21,753
You interested?

1286
01:19:21,836 --> 01:19:22,754
Could be.

1287
01:19:22,837 --> 01:19:25,048
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

1288
01:19:25,131 --> 01:19:27,508
If I'm in, I'm in.

1289
01:19:27,550 --> 01:19:29,719
Okay, you're in.

1290
01:19:29,802 --> 01:19:31,011
All right.

1291
01:19:33,847 --> 01:19:35,224
What do you think, Charlie?

1292
01:19:35,307 --> 01:19:36,308
This'll work.

1293
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:37,851
Let's go.

1294
01:19:48,694 --> 01:19:50,112
You're amazing.

1295
01:19:50,196 --> 01:19:51,572
It's a work of genius.

1296
01:19:51,655 --> 01:19:52,615
Uh-huh.

1297
01:20:01,373 --> 01:20:03,333
You okay?

1298
01:20:03,374 --> 01:20:04,334
Just give me a moment.

1299
01:20:04,375 --> 01:20:05,501
Now?

1300
01:20:05,585 --> 01:20:08,754
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

1301
01:20:08,838 --> 01:20:10,798
and if the brass touches
the sides,

1302
01:20:10,923 --> 01:20:13,425
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

1303
01:20:16,261 --> 01:20:18,096
Take all the time you need.

1304
01:20:21,182 --> 01:20:22,726
Hey, Charlie.

1305
01:20:22,809 --> 01:20:25,812
What?

1306
01:20:25,895 --> 01:20:29,273
I love you, man.

1307
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:31,650
I love you, too.

1308
01:20:34,194 --> 01:20:37,281
Okay.
Okay.

1309
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:49,458
Your attention, please.

1310
01:20:49,542 --> 01:20:51,377
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

1311
01:20:51,419 --> 01:20:53,212
in approximately 15 minutes.

1312
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,729
Check positions.

1313
01:21:11,770 --> 01:21:12,771
Napster?

1314
01:21:12,897 --> 01:21:15,732
I'm in position.

1315
01:21:15,774 --> 01:21:17,317
Handsome Rob?

1316
01:21:17,401 --> 01:21:18,568
We're in position.

1317
01:21:18,652 --> 01:21:20,695
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

1318
01:21:23,782 --> 01:21:25,742
Wrench?

1319
01:21:25,825 --> 01:21:27,493
Set.

1320
01:21:43,758 --> 01:21:45,426
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

1321
01:21:45,468 --> 01:21:48,137
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

1322
01:21:48,221 --> 01:21:49,180
We'll deal with it.

1323
01:21:55,602 --> 01:21:57,271
Who are these cats?

1324
01:21:57,354 --> 01:21:58,438
What's wrong?

1325
01:21:58,480 --> 01:22:00,482
Charlie, you won't believe this.

1326
01:22:00,524 --> 01:22:02,609
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

1327
01:22:02,650 --> 01:22:06,237
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

1328
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,030
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

1329
01:22:08,114 --> 01:22:09,949
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

1330
01:22:09,991 --> 01:22:11,784
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

1331
01:22:11,867 --> 01:22:15,120
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

1332
01:22:15,204 --> 01:22:17,289
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

1333
01:22:28,591 --> 01:22:30,301
Okay, let's go!

1334
01:22:30,343 --> 01:22:32,344
Moving out!

1335
01:22:45,023 --> 01:22:46,607
Here we go.

1336
01:22:46,691 --> 01:22:48,317
They're pulling out.

1337
01:22:48,359 --> 01:22:49,986
Napster,

1338
01:22:50,069 --> 01:22:52,988
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

1339
01:22:53,030 --> 01:22:55,783
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

1340
01:22:58,827 --> 01:23:01,496
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

1341
01:23:01,579 --> 01:23:03,790
See which one's riding low.

1342
01:23:14,717 --> 01:23:16,176
First one is...

1343
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:20,347
First two are the same, so...

1344
01:23:24,559 --> 01:23:27,437
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

1345
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,363
We're moving out.

1346
01:23:39,865 --> 01:23:41,741
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

1347
01:23:41,783 --> 01:23:43,034
we're heading to the airport.

1348
01:23:57,589 --> 01:24:01,551
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

1349
01:24:01,635 --> 01:24:03,344
Gridlock time.

1350
01:24:04,929 --> 01:24:08,558
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

1351
01:24:08,599 --> 01:24:10,476
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

1352
01:24:12,478 --> 01:24:14,438
We've crashed.

1353
01:24:16,231 --> 01:24:18,150
It's not a crash.

1354
01:24:19,317 --> 01:24:20,735
We've got power.

1355
01:24:21,778 --> 01:24:23,571
I can't log in.

1356
01:24:23,655 --> 01:24:28,075
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

1357
01:24:34,957 --> 01:24:35,958
Oops.

1358
01:24:40,462 --> 01:24:43,715
You'll... never... shut down...

1359
01:24:43,798 --> 01:24:46,551
the real... Napster.

1360
01:24:54,266 --> 01:24:55,642
What's your problem?!

1361
01:25:01,982 --> 01:25:03,858
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

1362
01:25:03,942 --> 01:25:05,693
This is truck 128.

1363
01:25:05,777 --> 01:25:07,528
Traffic's out of control here.

1364
01:25:07,612 --> 01:25:09,530
We've got to look
for another route.

1365
01:25:09,614 --> 01:25:12,992
Check the police band.

1366
01:25:13,033 --> 01:25:14,993
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

1367
01:25:19,331 --> 01:25:20,707
Oh, get us out of here.

1368
01:25:20,790 --> 01:25:21,875
I'm trying.

1369
01:25:26,713 --> 01:25:28,881
And he's taking it.

1370
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:36,263
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

1371
01:25:36,346 --> 01:25:37,306
at Traffic Control Center.

1372
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:40,475
Nice, Charlie.

1373
01:25:40,517 --> 01:25:42,769
What are you up to?

1374
01:25:42,852 --> 01:25:45,104
Go back.

1375
01:25:53,195 --> 01:25:55,531
I now command you to turn left.

1376
01:25:57,491 --> 01:25:58,992
Come on, take the left.

1377
01:26:01,161 --> 01:26:02,495
Yeah, you did.

1378
01:26:02,537 --> 01:26:04,122
You did.

1379
01:26:38,653 --> 01:26:39,988
Give us the flag.

1380
01:26:40,071 --> 01:26:42,032
Metro just passed through
the station.

1381
01:26:42,115 --> 01:26:44,159
You are clear for 90 seconds.

1382
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:45,368
Go.

1383
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:02,217
Come on, Steve.

1384
01:27:19,232 --> 01:27:20,108
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1385
01:27:24,320 --> 01:27:27,031
Look out!
Look out!

1386
01:27:27,115 --> 01:27:28,074
30 seconds and counting.

1387
01:27:35,622 --> 01:27:36,957
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

1388
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,166
or you're paint on the train.

1389
01:27:44,130 --> 01:27:45,131
Go, go, come on, come on!

1390
01:27:46,382 --> 01:27:47,925
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

1391
01:27:54,973 --> 01:27:56,391
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1392
01:27:56,475 --> 01:27:58,393
You're gonna stop right there.

1393
01:28:36,803 --> 01:28:38,263
Okay, guys.

1394
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:39,723
Coming into position.

1395
01:28:39,848 --> 01:28:41,141
Stay cool.

1396
01:28:53,193 --> 01:28:54,528
Ten...

1397
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:56,655
nine...

1398
01:28:56,697 --> 01:28:58,448
eight...

1399
01:28:58,532 --> 01:29:00,242
seven...

1400
01:29:00,325 --> 01:29:01,660
six...

1401
01:29:01,701 --> 01:29:03,328
five...

1402
01:29:03,411 --> 01:29:05,121
four...

1403
01:29:05,204 --> 01:29:05,955
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

1404
01:29:06,039 --> 01:29:07,457
-don't lose them.
-three...

1405
01:29:07,540 --> 01:29:09,458
two...

1406
01:29:09,542 --> 01:29:11,168
one.

1407
01:29:32,771 --> 01:29:34,356
Damn.

1408
01:29:40,612 --> 01:29:42,197
Where's my truck?

1409
01:29:42,238 --> 01:29:44,782
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

1410
01:29:49,245 --> 01:29:51,122
It just blew right through
the street.

1411
01:29:51,205 --> 01:29:52,623
Well, get under there.

1412
01:30:03,383 --> 01:30:06,052
We have another problem, guys.

1413
01:30:06,135 --> 01:30:06,928
What?

1414
01:30:08,095 --> 01:30:09,930
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

1415
01:30:09,972 --> 01:30:10,848
What?

1416
01:30:12,141 --> 01:30:13,726
He switched safes on us.

1417
01:30:15,227 --> 01:30:16,395
Can you do it?

1418
01:30:16,478 --> 01:30:17,854
It's lsraeli made.

1419
01:30:17,938 --> 01:30:19,564
It's got a glass re-lock system.

1420
01:30:19,606 --> 01:30:21,733
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

1421
01:30:21,858 --> 01:30:23,568
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

1422
01:30:23,610 --> 01:30:25,486
steel rods snap into place

1423
01:30:25,570 --> 01:30:26,738
and you can't open the safe.

1424
01:30:26,779 --> 01:30:28,489
And then we're up shit creek.

1425
01:30:57,808 --> 01:31:01,353
I think I just
cracked the glass.

1426
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:04,439
I don't think it broke though.

1427
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,275
I can't drill it again.

1428
01:31:07,358 --> 01:31:09,902
I have to do it by touch.

1429
01:31:12,321 --> 01:31:13,447
I can't get through.

1430
01:31:13,530 --> 01:31:15,074
The train's blocking the tunnel.

1431
01:31:15,157 --> 01:31:16,992
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

1432
01:31:17,075 --> 01:31:18,035
1 1th and Fig.

1433
01:31:18,118 --> 01:31:19,744
Positions two and three,

1434
01:31:19,828 --> 01:31:21,621
meet at 1 1th and Figueroa
and double back

1435
01:31:21,663 --> 01:31:22,747
to Hollywood and Highland.

1436
01:31:22,831 --> 01:31:24,415
Hurry up!

1437
01:31:39,137 --> 01:31:41,097
Your attention please.

1438
01:31:41,181 --> 01:31:43,141
Baggage for train number 22

1439
01:31:43,224 --> 01:31:45,476
is now available
at carousel number four.

1440
01:31:45,518 --> 01:31:48,437
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

1441
01:31:48,521 --> 01:31:50,231
at carousel number four.

1442
01:32:23,678 --> 01:32:25,596
I can't do this, Charlie.

1443
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,597
Stella...

1444
01:32:26,681 --> 01:32:27,723
I can't do it--
I need a drill,

1445
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:29,016
a borescope, something.

1446
01:32:29,100 --> 01:32:30,476
-I need to...
-You don't need any of that.

1447
01:32:30,559 --> 01:32:31,852
Come on, Charlie.

1448
01:32:31,936 --> 01:32:34,104
Hey, you can do this.

1449
01:33:29,238 --> 01:33:30,406
Slide.

1450
01:33:30,489 --> 01:33:31,782
Come on, come on.

1451
01:33:38,330 --> 01:33:39,873
Hey.

1452
01:33:39,956 --> 01:33:43,084
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

1453
01:33:43,168 --> 01:33:44,252
Absolutely.

1454
01:33:47,588 --> 01:33:49,090
Napster.

1455
01:33:49,131 --> 01:33:50,091
Yeah?

1456
01:33:50,132 --> 01:33:52,176
13 across, four high, four deep.

1457
01:33:53,802 --> 01:33:56,263
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

1458
01:33:56,305 --> 01:33:57,472
How much?

1459
01:33:57,556 --> 01:33:59,933
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

1460
01:34:03,394 --> 01:34:04,854
2.7... 2.7 million.

1461
01:34:04,938 --> 01:34:05,647
What?

1462
01:34:06,731 --> 01:34:07,857
No, it's 27.

1463
01:34:07,940 --> 01:34:09,317
That's 27 million.

1464
01:34:09,358 --> 01:34:11,318
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

1465
01:34:15,656 --> 01:34:18,658
Yeah!

1466
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:22,662
Got the... holy spirit.

1467
01:34:22,704 --> 01:34:25,164
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

1468
01:35:02,407 --> 01:35:03,867
What did you think, John?

1469
01:35:12,041 --> 01:35:13,542
27 million.

1470
01:35:13,626 --> 01:35:15,043
Say it again.

1471
01:35:15,127 --> 01:35:17,421
-27 million.
-Say it again.

1472
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,422
-Say it again!
-27 million.

1473
01:35:19,506 --> 01:35:20,674
Say it again!

1474
01:35:44,195 --> 01:35:45,863
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

1475
01:35:49,241 --> 01:35:50,868
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

1476
01:35:50,951 --> 01:35:52,536
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

1477
01:35:52,578 --> 01:35:54,204
Stop them before they get
to the street.

1478
01:35:59,209 --> 01:36:00,210
Shit!

1479
01:36:04,505 --> 01:36:05,089
Whoa!

1480
01:36:19,394 --> 01:36:20,228
Here we go.

1481
01:36:29,487 --> 01:36:30,112
Whoo!

1482
01:36:32,239 --> 01:36:32,740
Whoa! Whoa!

1483
01:36:35,492 --> 01:36:36,076
Open your door.

1484
01:36:41,456 --> 01:36:43,541
Come on, guys, we're moving.

1485
01:36:48,754 --> 01:36:50,214
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

1486
01:36:59,848 --> 01:37:02,475
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

1487
01:37:29,792 --> 01:37:31,418
Come on!

1488
01:37:38,175 --> 01:37:40,427
Where you going?
Where you going?

1489
01:37:59,861 --> 01:38:00,695
I'm going to take Steve.

1490
01:38:00,779 --> 01:38:01,863
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

1491
01:38:01,946 --> 01:38:03,156
I'll meet you there.

1492
01:38:04,365 --> 01:38:05,950
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

1493
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:16,501
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

1494
01:38:20,005 --> 01:38:21,673
I know it's you, Charlie.

1495
01:38:23,675 --> 01:38:24,634
Take your next left.

1496
01:39:24,397 --> 01:39:25,690
Nice move, Steve.

1497
01:40:04,100 --> 01:40:05,143
Get out!

1498
01:40:05,226 --> 01:40:07,061
-Get out!
-Okay.

1499
01:40:07,145 --> 01:40:08,646
I said get out!

1500
01:41:43,483 --> 01:41:44,400
They got a bunch of cars

1501
01:41:44,484 --> 01:41:46,069
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

1502
01:41:46,152 --> 01:41:48,154
Look, look, man...

1503
01:41:48,237 --> 01:41:50,614
-I don't know anything...
-Hey, don't worry about them.

1504
01:41:50,698 --> 01:41:53,075
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

1505
01:41:57,579 --> 01:41:59,956
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

1506
01:42:04,586 --> 01:42:06,254
Come on.

1507
01:42:12,051 --> 01:42:14,094
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

1508
01:42:19,057 --> 01:42:21,184
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

1509
01:42:21,267 --> 01:42:24,479
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

1510
01:42:24,562 --> 01:42:27,190
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

1511
01:42:27,273 --> 01:42:28,441
The helicopter routine,

1512
01:42:28,524 --> 01:42:30,276
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

1513
01:42:30,359 --> 01:42:33,946
But now I've got the gold--
and you, you've got nothing.

1514
01:42:34,029 --> 01:42:34,780
I got this.

1515
01:42:34,863 --> 01:42:36,073
So cut the crap,

1516
01:42:36,114 --> 01:42:37,824
and give me my goddamn gold!

1517
01:42:51,921 --> 01:42:53,839
Who the hell are you?

1518
01:42:53,922 --> 01:42:55,716
I am Mashkov...

1519
01:42:55,799 --> 01:42:57,718
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

1520
01:42:57,801 --> 01:42:59,761
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

1521
01:43:09,228 --> 01:43:10,896
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

1522
01:43:10,980 --> 01:43:12,982
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

1523
01:43:13,065 --> 01:43:14,233
a lot of unsavory people.

1524
01:43:14,316 --> 01:43:15,943
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

1525
01:43:16,026 --> 01:43:18,028
You are right...

1526
01:43:18,111 --> 01:43:20,030
no imagination.

1527
01:43:22,824 --> 01:43:24,409
There's a lot of gold in there.

1528
01:43:24,492 --> 01:43:25,993
We're the only ones with guns.

1529
01:43:26,077 --> 01:43:27,495
I'll make you a good deal.

1530
01:43:35,544 --> 01:43:37,421
I've already made my deal.

1531
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:44,093
What do you want?

1532
01:43:44,177 --> 01:43:46,429
You know this was
never about the gold.

1533
01:43:46,512 --> 01:43:48,639
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

1534
01:43:53,060 --> 01:43:54,686
Bitch!

1535
01:43:54,812 --> 01:43:56,480
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

1536
01:43:58,106 --> 01:43:59,232
Okay.

1537
01:44:02,694 --> 01:44:03,945
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1538
01:44:04,028 --> 01:44:05,613
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

1539
01:44:05,697 --> 01:44:06,614
Just don't shoot me.

1540
01:44:06,697 --> 01:44:08,824
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

1541
01:44:08,908 --> 01:44:11,911
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

1542
01:44:11,994 --> 01:44:13,829
I think you would be
very interested

1543
01:44:13,871 --> 01:44:15,497
in some of the machinery I use.

1544
01:44:18,375 --> 01:44:19,376
No, come on.

1545
01:44:24,923 --> 01:44:26,007
Guys.

1546
01:44:26,049 --> 01:44:28,175
I want to make a toast.

1547
01:44:28,259 --> 01:44:29,677
To John Bridger,

1548
01:44:29,719 --> 01:44:32,388
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

1549
01:44:32,471 --> 01:44:34,390
Father and friend.

1550
01:44:34,473 --> 01:44:35,516
To my dad.

1551
01:44:40,478 --> 01:44:41,688
Stella was right.

1552
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:43,231
It wasn't about the money.

1553
01:44:43,273 --> 01:44:44,774
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

1554
01:44:44,857 --> 01:44:46,192
from having a little bit of fun.

1555
01:44:46,234 --> 01:44:48,194
# Money! #

1556
01:44:48,236 --> 01:44:50,696
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

1557
01:44:52,281 --> 01:44:55,242
# Get a good job with good pay... #

1558
01:44:55,284 --> 01:44:57,536
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

1559
01:44:59,746 --> 01:45:06,127
# Money, it's a gas #

1560
01:45:06,210 --> 01:45:11,382
# Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash #

1561
01:45:11,465 --> 01:45:12,967
He got off with a warning.

1562
01:45:13,050 --> 01:45:16,637
# New car, caviar,
four star daydream #

1563
01:45:16,720 --> 01:45:19,264
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

1564
01:45:19,347 --> 01:45:22,308
with a room just for his shoes.

1565
01:45:22,392 --> 01:45:23,434
Buenos dias.

1566
01:45:23,518 --> 01:45:26,646
Buenos dias.

1567
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:30,858
# Money, get back #

1568
01:45:30,941 --> 01:45:33,319
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

1569
01:45:33,402 --> 01:45:37,864
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack #

1570
01:45:37,948 --> 01:45:39,032
Are you really the Napster?

1571
01:45:39,116 --> 01:45:40,450
# Money! #

1572
01:45:40,533 --> 01:45:41,660
Yes, I am.

1573
01:45:41,743 --> 01:45:43,661
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

1574
01:45:43,786 --> 01:45:47,874
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

1575
01:45:47,957 --> 01:45:49,083
With speakers so loud

1576
01:45:49,125 --> 01:45:51,335
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

1577
01:45:51,418 --> 01:45:54,880
# I'm in the high-fidelity... #

1578
01:45:54,963 --> 01:45:56,089
If you would.

1579
01:45:56,131 --> 01:45:57,674
# ...first class traveling set #

1580
01:45:57,758 --> 01:46:03,138
# And I think I need a Lear jet #

1581
01:46:11,896 --> 01:46:13,605
And me?

1582
01:46:13,689 --> 01:46:16,650
I took John Bridger's advice.

1583
01:46:16,692 --> 01:46:19,945
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

1584
01:46:20,028 --> 01:46:21,613
and I'm gonna hold on
to her forever.

1585
01:47:25,213 --> 01:47:27,632
# Money! #

1586
01:47:27,715 --> 01:47:31,302
# It's a crime #

1587
01:47:31,385 --> 01:47:38,517
# Share it fairly, but don't
take a slice of my pie #

1588
01:47:38,558 --> 01:47:44,856
# Money, so they say #

1589
01:47:44,897 --> 01:47:51,987
# Is the root of all evil today #

1590
01:47:52,071 --> 01:47:56,867
# But if you ask for a raise
it's no surprise #

1591
01:47:56,908 --> 01:48:00,370
# They're giving none away #

1592
01:48:00,412 --> 01:48:02,455
# Away... away... #

1593
01:48:02,539 --> 01:48:03,456
# Away... #
