cigarettes that is.

You don't want me

Okay. Okay.

you guys 10 cigarettes.

And you gotta fucking eat
a tube of toothpaste.

What about you if you lose?

Are we talking about
the entire thing?
He's gotta eat the entire thing?

174

You've got to eat
the whole thing.

And if you lose you've gotta
eat the whole toothpaste.

310
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:52,283
Be a man.
Just-- Just--
Just eat the whole thing.

311
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,009
Here you go.
[Gasps]

312
00:19:54,001 --> 00:19:57,302
All right!
[All Laughing]

313
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:03,469
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about!

314
00:20:03,377 --> 00:20:05,612
[Coughing]
Come on.

315
00:20:05,586 --> 00:20:08,154
You are the man.
[Grunting]

316
00:20:08,114 --> 00:20:10,615
Gotta be a man, man.
Just put it in there, man.

317
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:12,947
[Groaning]
I'm trying to eat it.

318
00:20:12,915 --> 00:20:15,517
I'm trying to eat it.
You're almost done, man.
Look at the tube.

319
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:18,076
You can do it.
You can do it.
You can do it, brother.

320
00:20:18,036 --> 00:20:20,305
Come on. Let's go.
You can do it.

321
00:20:20,276 --> 00:20:23,679
Just get it all
done at once, man.
A little bit of blood.

322
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:28,176
You can do it, man.
You can do it. See, that's all
we wanted you to do.

323
00:20:28,055 --> 00:20:30,589
More. Come on.
Keep squeezing.
That's all we wanted you to do.

324
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,118
That's all.
Is he crying?

325
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,915
Don't, don't, don't--
[Chattering]

326
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,999
Just swallow it, dude.
Oh, come on, man.
It's okay.

327
00:20:38,936 --> 00:20:43,506
[Coughing]
There we go.
That is my brother! Yeah!

328
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:46,987
[Applauding]
[Cheering]

329
00:20:46,905 --> 00:20:49,240
Come on!
Come on. Here.
I'll help you up.

330
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,845
[Grunts]
Come on, big guy.

331
00:20:51,802 --> 00:20:55,071
There you go.
Come on.
Hell, yeah.

332
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:56,937
You're good. You're good.
You're good.

333
00:20:58,747 --> 00:21:01,816
You did good.
You won.
Okay.

334
00:21:01,756 --> 00:21:03,857
- You won.
- Man, you looked fucked up.

335
00:21:03,836 --> 00:21:05,504
Come on.
Give him a hug.

336
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:08,168
Don't do any
weird shit to him.
Now go clean yourself.

337
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,626
Look at you.
Go clean yourself.

338
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,099
See how much better
you feel about yourself, man?

339
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:17,227
Damn!
[Water Running]

340
00:21:17,183 --> 00:21:19,551
Damn.

341
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,987
That was exciting, huh?

342
00:21:21,952 --> 00:21:23,986
It kind of made my day.

343
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:27,629
Ah, geez.
He's gonna puke.

344
00:21:27,617 --> 00:21:29,885
No, no, no.
He's fine.

345
00:21:31,297 --> 00:21:34,098
Hey, you all right, man?
You all right?

346
00:21:34,049 --> 00:21:36,418
Hey, hey.

347
00:21:36,386 --> 00:21:39,288
Don't stress, man.
Don't stress. Okay?

348
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:41,169
You're all right. Okay?

349
00:21:41,155 --> 00:21:43,023
- You don't feel well?
- No.

350
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:45,013
Is your stomach
out of sorts, man?
No, I'm fine.

351
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:46,396
You sure?
Yeah.

352
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:50,010
Are you mad?
No. No.

353
00:21:51,013 --> 00:21:53,014
Hey, it's not
a big deal, man.
Look, dude.

354
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:54,899
It was a fucking bet,
and you lost the bet.

355
00:21:54,918 --> 00:21:58,754
So we made you do it, you know
what I mean? We're just
holding you true to your word.

356
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:02,272
Would you understand
what it's like?

357
00:22:02,246 --> 00:22:05,015
You have any fuckin' idea?

358
00:22:04,968 --> 00:22:07,936
You have no idea
what it's like?

359
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,681
No?

360
00:22:09,673 --> 00:22:13,475
Because you're either with 'em,
or you're against 'em.

361
00:22:16,938 --> 00:22:19,940
Oh, I regret it.

362
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:22,784
I don't know if he actually
wanted to help him or not.

363
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:25,199
But I think he, uh--

364
00:22:25,163 --> 00:22:27,198
he just wanted
to have some more fun.

365
00:22:29,131 --> 00:22:31,099
I think he realized...

366
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:37,493
what would come
if he didn't.

367
00:22:37,421 --> 00:22:40,557
How you feeling, man?

368
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:42,962
You all right?
Your stomach better?

369
00:22:45,838 --> 00:22:47,773
Hey, you all right?

370
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:50,160
Yeah, I'm fine.
You sure?

371
00:22:50,127 --> 00:22:53,396
Mm-hmm.
You seem
a little, um, quiet.

372
00:22:54,064 --> 00:22:56,066
Your stomach
feeling all right?

373
00:22:58,641 --> 00:23:01,943
Let me-- Let me, um--
I'm gonna make you a drink.

374
00:23:01,874 --> 00:23:04,108
It's gonna take care of you.

375
00:23:04,082 --> 00:23:06,517
You'll feel like you never ate
a whole tube of toothpaste.

376
00:23:06,483 --> 00:23:09,185
I'm serious.
It's good.
It'll be good for you.

377
00:23:10,996 --> 00:23:14,131
All right?
Hang in there.
I'll get you.

Hey. Hey.

[Whistles]
Come on.

382
00:23:54,363 --> 00:23:56,331
Drink this.
It'll help settle your stomach.

383
00:23:56,315 --> 00:24:00,419
Why don't you
drink it?
Ah, come on.

384
00:24:00,316 --> 00:24:02,251
Come on.

00:24:04,029 --> 00:24:06,531
Hey.
Come on.

00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:09,762
Hey.
It's all right, dude.

387
00:24:26,689 --> 00:24:28,890
Now drink.

[Chuckles]

389
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:35,666
Why are you so cynical, huh?

390
00:24:35,587 --> 00:24:39,155
I make you a drink,
and you assume that
I'm out to fucking get you,

391
00:24:39,075 --> 00:24:41,777
that I'm out to hurt you,
that I'm out to fuck with you?

392
00:24:41,732 --> 00:24:45,801
You really think that
I would drink that? Why?
I don't get it.

393
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:48,502
I don't understand.
What did I do to you?
Why are you so cynical?

394
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,654
Why are you
so cynical?
What did I do to you?

395
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:53,698
Why do you think
I'm trying to fuck with you?
I'm trying-- 'Cause you are.

396
00:24:53,638 --> 00:24:55,839
I'm trying to help you out, man.

397
00:24:55,814 --> 00:24:58,082
You're such
a fucking liar.
I'm not.

398
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:01,124
- I may live
on the streets, but--
- Hey, hey, hey.

399
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:02,663
Hey. What?

400
00:25:02,663 --> 00:25:06,767
I said, I may
live on the streets,
but I'm not fucking stupid.

401
00:25:06,665 --> 00:25:10,100
So don't treat me
like I'm fucking stupid.
I'm not. I'm not.

402
00:25:10,025 --> 00:25:12,593
I promise.

[Gags]
I made you something.

407
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,741
I want you to drink it.
Come on. It's okay.

Hey. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,365
It's okay.
Come on.

00:25:44,079 --> 00:25:46,014
What is that, coffee?

411
00:25:47,376 --> 00:25:50,177
Think you're gonna
get out of here?
Come on. Just drink it, man.

The decision has
already been made.
You've already fucking drank it.

00:25:53,393 --> 00:25:56,127
You've already drank it.
There's no way out of this,
all right?

[Bangs]
Oh!

00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:00,411

It's just a little coffee,

a little salt,
a little--
a little peppers.

Come on.
Let's see you drink it.

418

[Sniffing]
It smells good.

Smell.

We can go there.
We can go there, man.

You wanna do it?

- You have any fucking idea?
Do you see these two?
- Hey, hey. Come on, man.

423
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:21,238
If he knows any better,
he'll drink it, dude.
Come on.

424
00:26:21,174 --> 00:26:24,309
Just mellow out, man.
What are you gonna do?
Just-- Seriously.

425
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,480
It's not gonna kill you.

426
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:32,135
Why don't you just-- Fuck.
The fucking odds
are against you, man.

427
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,992
Move. Come on. Hey.

Oh, that stinks, man.
Oh, my God.
That stinks!

You've gotta
clean that up, man.

What--
What do you want to hear?

442
00:27:31,138 --> 00:27:33,173
Yeah, it was a selfish thing.

443
00:27:36,515 --> 00:27:38,716
So we wanted him--

444
00:27:38,691 --> 00:27:41,393
we wanted him to clean
everything up.

445
00:27:41,348 --> 00:27:43,715
Harry especially.
You know, he's very--

446
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:48,603
Yeah, you make it seem like,
you know,

447
00:27:48,517 --> 00:27:52,854
it was a mutual
sort of dining experience.

448

You know what
you've gotta do, right?

449
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:00,567
Are you listening to me?
Are you listening to me?

450
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:02,922
You're gonna clean that up.

451
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:05,123
- [Mitch]
I'll get-- I'll get the mop.
- Know what?

452
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,528
You're gonna clean that up
without the mop.

453
00:28:07,497 --> 00:28:10,032
I think I wanna see you
clean that up with your tongue.

454
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:13,395
I mean, just put it back
where it came from, huh?

Just leave it, man.
Leave it.

eat his own barf.

He's making a mess of this place
over and over again.

00:52:19,341 --> 00:52:22,311
He, uh, deserved it, right?

[Man On TV,

767
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:33,792
I mean, he deserved it.

768
00:52:35,409 --> 00:52:38,644
I know.
He rang the button.

769
00:52:44,306 --> 00:52:48,242
I mean, if there's
one rule you don't break,
it's the red button.

when they come in here
and they find him...

and they see the blood
and the fucking bruises
and the towels, huh?

00:53:32,059 --> 00:53:34,060
We've gotta do something.

What the fuck
do you propose to do, man?

779
00:53:42,076 --> 00:53:44,978
He just had
this weird stare...

780
00:53:44,925 --> 00:53:47,494
as if he could see
through the walls.

for all this?

I hope this is ending soon,

I hope that will be enough,

He would look
right through you.

00:54:23,427 --> 00:54:26,729
I think he knew
what they were up to.

792
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,730
Because I couldn't.
Because I'm not strong enough.

Because I wouldn't survive
another fucking week in here.

Come out and fucking say it.
I--

798
00:54:53,097 --> 00:54:58,201
Look, I read a story about
these two cell mates, right?

799
00:54:58,058 --> 00:55:02,095
And in the middle of the night
this one cat
fucking hangs himself.

fucked up in the head...

to the point that they send him
to a psych ward.

We all do it together.

921
01:03:25,029 --> 01:03:28,165
I don't know about you,
Jack, but, uh,

922
01:03:28,101 --> 01:03:31,838
I'm starting to like this guy
compared to that guy right now.

923
01:03:34,567 --> 01:03:38,235
[Groans]
There's someone else in
the room who needs to hang.

924
01:03:41,096 --> 01:03:43,297
You ready, brother?

925
01:03:43,272 --> 01:03:45,273
Gonna help us out here?

926
01:03:46,281 --> 01:03:48,215
Um--

927
01:03:50,602 --> 01:03:52,803
Sure.

928
01:03:52,778 --> 01:03:55,546
Then I "regretted" it.

929
01:03:55,467 --> 01:03:57,401
[Clears Throat]

930
01:03:57,451 --> 01:04:02,655
[Sobbing]
They did everything, and--
and I didn't stop 'em.

931
01:04:02,507 --> 01:04:04,475
I didn't just stop them.
I didn't do anything.

932
01:04:04,493 --> 01:04:06,927
I stood there,
and I didn't fucking stop 'em.

933
01:04:06,925 --> 01:04:09,326
I didn't do a fucking thing.

934
01:04:11,117 --> 01:04:13,018
He was lying there.

935
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:15,840
He was just lying there,
and--

936
01:04:20,143 --> 01:04:23,578
and we were getting--
we were getting nervous.

937
01:04:29,072 --> 01:04:32,842
Come on, man.
Quit-- Quit giving us
the silent treatment.

938
01:04:34,194 --> 01:04:38,330
I know you wanna die
just as much as we
want you to, so, uh,

939
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:42,852
do something
or say something.

940
01:04:44,148 --> 01:04:46,115
I know you can talk.

941
01:04:48,756 --> 01:04:50,957
Hello?

942
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:54,561
I know you wanna die, man.
Come on.

943
01:04:57,462 --> 01:04:59,196
Okay.
Lift him up.

944
01:05:00,086 --> 01:05:02,053
Okay.

945
01:05:02,038 --> 01:05:04,006
What the f--

946
01:05:03,991 --> 01:05:07,159
[Chuckles, Grunts]

947
01:05:07,095 --> 01:05:10,030
All right, I'll let you
do us a favor.

948
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:15,401
You put the cord
around your neck.

949
01:05:15,353 --> 01:05:18,122
I mean, come on.
This is supposed to be
a suicide, right?

950
01:05:18,073 --> 01:05:20,074
[Jack Chuckles]

951
01:05:23,994 --> 01:05:26,028
Yeah, man.

952
01:05:28,603 --> 01:05:30,404
Come on.

953
01:05:36,348 --> 01:05:38,283
Do it for us. Yeah.

954
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:40,171
Wow.
Do it for yourself.

955
01:05:40,157 --> 01:05:43,392
Wow. You see this?

956
01:05:43,325 --> 01:05:45,727
This is a man...

957
01:05:45,695 --> 01:05:47,896
with some serious cojones.

958
01:05:47,839 --> 01:05:49,774
Huh.

959
01:05:57,152 --> 01:05:59,153
I love you, man.
[Laughs]

960
01:05:59,137 --> 01:06:01,438
I fucking love you.
Give me a hug!

961
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:03,344
Yes!

962
01:06:08,931 --> 01:06:10,932
Okay, ahh--
What do you think?

963
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:12,916
How should we do this?

964
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:20,274
We lift him up,
and Peter ties the knot.

965
01:06:20,164 --> 01:06:22,098
Right?

966
01:06:25,541 --> 01:06:27,475
Right?

967
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:32,926
-Not secure enough
in your own ideas?
-Whose fucking idea was it, huh?

968
01:06:32,838 --> 01:06:36,408
You know what we do to people
like you, huh? Huh?

969
01:06:36,328 --> 01:06:38,629
People like you
are people like-- like him.

970
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:42,002
You don't want to end
like him, okay?

971
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,797
So you better cooperate.

972
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:49,308
I mean,
it was his idea, right?
Yeah.

973
01:06:49,226 --> 01:06:52,695
Come. Come.
Let's do it, huh?

974
01:06:52,618 --> 01:06:54,553
Yeah.

975
01:06:57,548 --> 01:06:59,582
Gonna help us?

976
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,795
Yeah.

977
01:07:02,764 --> 01:07:04,732
It was my idea.

978
01:07:06,414 --> 01:07:08,982
[Peter]
Come on. Yeah. Lift him up.

979
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:10,943
[Harry]
Let's do it.

980
01:07:18,222 --> 01:07:20,157
[Exhales]

981
01:07:21,456 --> 01:07:24,925
He didn't seem
very resistant to-- to me.

982
01:07:25,745 --> 01:07:27,612
Um--

983
01:07:33,489 --> 01:07:36,892
But, you know, I guess...

984
01:07:36,818 --> 01:07:38,819
my, uh--

985
01:07:39,795 --> 01:07:42,830
my influence
wasn't big enough.

986
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:44,972
I wish I could
fucking lie to you.

987
01:07:44,947 --> 01:07:47,149
I wish I could lie to you.

988
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:53,674
But I can't,
'cause I feel so fucking bad.

989
01:07:53,621 --> 01:07:56,223
Go on there.
[Groans]

990
01:07:56,182 --> 01:07:59,217
Gotta shift over a little.
Here. All right.

991
01:07:59,159 --> 01:08:04,596
Okay. Go again.
Lift him.
Okay. One--

992
01:08:04,439 --> 01:08:08,642
[Together]
Two, three!
[Groaning]

993
01:08:08,536 --> 01:08:10,903
Motherfucker.

994
01:08:12,217 --> 01:08:15,486
[Groaning, Laughing]

995
01:08:23,098 --> 01:08:25,367
There we go. All right.

996
01:08:25,339 --> 01:08:27,340
[Labored Breathing]

997
01:08:33,117 --> 01:08:36,319
Think happy thoughts,
okay?

998
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:39,470
Think happy thoughts.

999
01:08:41,278 --> 01:08:43,246
You won't be here soon.

1000
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,461
It fuckin' broke, man.
Fuck!

1001
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:56,828
- Shit.
- And now what, huh?

1002
01:08:56,801 --> 01:09:01,270
Oh, man.
You are a sly bastard.

1003
01:09:08,259 --> 01:09:10,260
What should we do?

1004
01:09:16,325 --> 01:09:18,259
Awful.

1005
01:09:19,141 --> 01:09:21,476
- Oh, shit.
- Fuck!

1006
01:09:21,446 --> 01:09:24,347
[Jack]
He just... wouldn't die.

1007
01:09:24,294 --> 01:09:27,329
All right,
get his bed sheet.

1008
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,139
Get his bed sheet, man.

1009
01:09:30,087 --> 01:09:33,022
Do you know how to tie a noose
with a sheet?

1010
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,571
I was so fucking tired.

1011
01:09:37,544 --> 01:09:41,347
I just wanted it
to fuckin' end.

1012
01:09:41,256 --> 01:09:43,591
[Imitates Gunshots,
Chuckles]

1013
01:09:52,106 --> 01:09:54,741
Mitch was, uh--
[Harry]
Tie it up there first, man.

1014
01:09:54,699 --> 01:10:00,004
basically fuckin'... nothing.

1015
01:10:01,483 --> 01:10:04,052
[Harry]
Tie it up there, man!

1016
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:16,261
No, no, don't worry. You don't
have to eat that. We're gonna
get you chicken nugget.

1017
01:10:16,143 --> 01:10:18,744
Okay.
But you gotta
eat it hanging.

1018
01:10:20,591 --> 01:10:22,760
[Coughs]
Are you ready?

1019
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:24,971
All right,
let's stand him up.

1020
01:10:24,945 --> 01:10:28,347
I felt like there was
no fuckin' way out,

1021
01:10:28,273 --> 01:10:30,341
because I felt like--

1022
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:35,586
because I felt like
as soon as the C.O. came in
we'd be fucked.

1023
01:10:35,507 --> 01:10:37,474
Let's get him up.
All right.

1024
01:10:38,355 --> 01:10:41,190
- Okay, all right.
- [Thudding]

1025

[Laughs]
Okay, ready, set.

[Together]
Two, three!
[Groaning]

1027
01:10:45,716 --> 01:10:47,617
Fucker!
Let's get him up
on the bucket.

1028
01:10:47,604 --> 01:10:49,538
Okay.
[Bucket Clatters]

1029
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:52,560
All right. Go!
[Mutters]

1030
01:10:52,501 --> 01:10:54,469
[Muttering Continues]
Okay.

1031
01:10:54,454 --> 01:10:57,923
- Okay.
- [Groans]
Fuck.

1032
01:10:59,382 --> 01:11:02,985
Think happy thoughts, man.
Okay?

1033
01:11:04,919 --> 01:11:07,054
Think of good things.

1034
01:11:07,032 --> 01:11:10,467
Mitch, um,

1035
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:13,461
tied the, uh,
sheet around his...

1036
01:11:15,321 --> 01:11:18,323
fucking piece-of-shit neck,

1037
01:11:18,266 --> 01:11:20,867
and, uh--

[Clicks Tongue]

1039
01:11:23,451 --> 01:11:26,753
I think Peter tied the, uh--

1040
01:11:26,684 --> 01:11:29,419
tied the knot onto the bar.
[Clears Throat]

1041
01:11:30,268 --> 01:11:32,436
To have it not be me.

1042
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:36,048
Think happy thoughts, man.
[Peter]
Does that make any sense to you?

1043
01:11:35,965 --> 01:11:37,899
No?

1044
01:11:38,877 --> 01:11:41,079
Think happy thoughts--

1045
01:11:41,054 --> 01:11:42,989
[Exhales]

1046
01:11:42,974 --> 01:11:45,676
like, uh, flowers and shit.

1047
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:48,633
I don't know.
[Chuckles]

1048
01:11:48,575 --> 01:11:50,510
[Mutters]

1049
01:11:54,849 --> 01:11:56,683
All right.
Put him on the bucket?

1050
01:11:56,673 --> 01:11:58,039
Yeah.
Okay.

1051
01:11:58,049 --> 01:12:00,818
Okay.

1052
01:12:00,769 --> 01:12:03,571
Huh.
Ohh!

1053
01:12:03,522 --> 01:12:05,690
[Harry]
Damn. You're heavy, man.

1054
01:12:09,347 --> 01:12:11,214
Here. Here.

1055
01:12:14,276 --> 01:12:17,512
[Sobbing]
It was my idea.
It was my idea.

1056
01:12:17,445 --> 01:12:20,213
It was my idea.
It was my fault.

1057
01:12:20,165 --> 01:12:23,533
It was my idea. I--

1058
01:12:23,461 --> 01:12:25,930
[Harry]
See how nice I am, man?

1059
01:12:25,894 --> 01:12:28,529
All right.

1060
01:12:28,487 --> 01:12:30,288
[Match Strikes]
Okay.

1061
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,346
There you go.

1062
01:12:32,327 --> 01:12:34,328
There you go.

1063
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:37,398
All right.

1064
01:12:39,624 --> 01:12:41,759
[Exhales]
Join him.

1065
01:12:43,753 --> 01:12:46,120
That was a lot of work.
No.

1066
01:12:47,594 --> 01:12:49,528
I-I-- I can't remember.

1067
01:12:49,515 --> 01:12:53,351
You're giving me that
really creepy look again, man.
[Laughs] I don't know!

1068
01:12:54,155 --> 01:12:56,790
Fuckin' guy wrapped a...

1069
01:12:56,747 --> 01:12:58,849
sheet around his own neck.

1070
01:13:01,260 --> 01:13:05,897
So, uh, technically
it's not us hanging him.

1071
01:13:05,773 --> 01:13:07,975
He hung himself.

1072
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,995
Look, uh--

1073
01:13:11,983 --> 01:13:14,617
[Sighs]

1074
01:13:14,575 --> 01:13:16,576
I'm sorry.

1075
01:13:17,615 --> 01:13:19,550
Okay?

1076
01:13:21,552 --> 01:13:24,921
Things got really
fucking out of hand.

1077
01:13:24,881 --> 01:13:27,449
But you're really taking one
for the team now. Okay?

1078
01:13:27,409 --> 01:13:30,244
- [Jack] You wanna die
and save our asses?
- It means a lot to me.

1079
01:13:30,194 --> 01:13:32,195
Thank you.

1080
01:13:34,163 --> 01:13:36,964
And I will never
forget you.

1081
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:41,533
Go fuck yourself.

1082
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:45,082
Go fuck yourself.

1083
01:13:45,044 --> 01:13:47,345
I gave you the full truth.

1084
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:53,150
He was standing on a bucket,
and, uh--

1085
01:13:53,046 --> 01:13:55,981
[Laughs] that son of a bitch,
man, he kicked
the fucking thing, man.

1086
01:13:55,927 --> 01:13:59,028
And, yeah, you kinda saw
a couple beats there where
his life was sort of--

1087
01:13:58,967 --> 01:14:01,368
[Inhales Deeply]
escaping him.

1088
01:14:01,335 --> 01:14:03,336
It was a trip.

1089
01:14:04,856 --> 01:14:08,024
- [Clears Throat]
- But you know what?

1090
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,828
Maybe that makes sense.

1091
01:14:09,817 --> 01:14:12,352
Maybe that's what
I should've done.

1092
01:14:20,731 --> 01:14:23,033
I didn't stop them
from killing him.

1093
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:28,394
That's what I regret.

1094
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:31,416
He should've eaten
that fucking toothpaste.
[Chuckles]

1095
01:14:31,357 --> 01:14:34,726
I guess he's gonna
fuckin' regret that for--

1096
01:14:34,654 --> 01:14:37,222
Well, he's dead.
He can't regret it.

1097
01:14:37,182 --> 01:14:39,316
You know--
You know what my problem is?

1098
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,968
You know what my problem was?

1099
01:14:42,943 --> 01:14:45,844
Is that I fucking
cared about him.

1100
01:14:45,791 --> 01:14:48,126
I liked him.
He was a fucking sweet kid.

1101
01:14:54,753 --> 01:14:56,754
Oh, God.
[Groaning]

[Door Buzzes]

1104
01:15:16,932 --> 01:15:19,568
Hey, sleepyhead.
Hmm?

1105
01:15:19,525 --> 01:15:23,128
Pick it up, man.
Wake up, man.

1106
01:15:24,231 --> 01:15:26,232
It's showtime.

1107
01:15:27,366 --> 01:15:29,867
[In Southern Accent]
Showtime.

1108
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:36,980
Mmm.

1109
01:15:43,146 --> 01:15:46,782
Well, ain't you a sight
for sore eyes, man?

1110
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:52,185
This is the first freaking
dead body I've ever seen.

1111
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:54,440
This shit's crazy.

1112
01:15:54,412 --> 01:15:56,747
Big ol' empty shell, dude.

1113
01:15:58,124 --> 01:16:00,125
He's cold.

1114
01:16:04,206 --> 01:16:06,840
That's nuts.

1115
01:16:11,982 --> 01:16:15,284
All right.
Should I press the alarm?

1116
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:19,361
[Jack]
Just a second.

1117
01:16:22,193 --> 01:16:25,829
What about you, cutie patootie?
Are you ready?

1118
01:16:25,745 --> 01:16:27,746
Yeah.

1119
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:32,166
I still don't
trust this guy.

1120
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:34,052
All right, I'm ready.

1121
01:16:34,035 --> 01:16:36,102
All right.
Let's do it.

1122
01:16:37,236 --> 01:16:40,838
Okay. All right.
We're all--

1123
01:16:40,756 --> 01:16:43,958
We're all really shocked
and really worried. Okay?

1124
01:16:43,893 --> 01:16:47,696
Worried.
[Heavy Breathing]
Okay, okay, okay.

[Panting, Yelping]

1126
01:16:51,638 --> 01:16:55,941
There's been a hanging in 313!
It's a suicide!

1127
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:59,166
Mitch killed himself!
Hurry up! Oh, my God.

1128
01:16:59,095 --> 01:17:02,297
Oh, my God. Shit. Oh!
[Siren Wailing]

1129
01:17:02,232 --> 01:17:04,166
Untie him.
Okay. I'm trying.

1130
01:17:04,152 --> 01:17:06,420
Untie him.
I'm trying.
I can't, man!

1131
01:17:06,393 --> 01:17:09,628
Peter, help us!
Peter! Peter!
Help out, man!

[Door Opens]
[Harry]
Dude, is he breathing?

1133
01:17:11,642 --> 01:17:14,443
Everybody over here
on your knees,
hands on your head!

1134

- Let's go, guys.

- Fall in line. Let's go.
- Jack! Join your friends,
on your knees.

1136
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:23,287
- We need a couple more guys
with a doctor.
- Jack, on your feet.

1137
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:26,997
- Help Mr. Cohen.
- Lift him up.
Let's go. Lift him up!

01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:29,143
- [Jack Grunting]
- [Harry]
Is he breathing at all?

1139
01:17:29,117 --> 01:17:31,919
[Cohen]
Shut up!

1140
01:17:31,869 --> 01:17:35,739
[Guard]
Did anyone see anything?
No, man. We were sleeping, dude.

1141
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:39,215
He's fucking dead. Come on.

1142
01:17:39,135 --> 01:17:41,636
Jack! Jack, back here
on your knees, please.

1143
01:17:41,599 --> 01:17:43,533
[Harry]
Is he alive?

1144
01:17:43,519 --> 01:17:46,454
- [Guard] Come on.
- [Harry]
Oh, fuck.

1145
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,303
Yo, this guy's ice-cold, man.
He's been here all night.

1146
01:17:51,137 --> 01:17:53,738
[Peter]
What went through my mind?

1147
01:17:53,696 --> 01:17:58,000
Sometimes you just
have to look away.

1148
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:00,784

[Taps Table]

1150
01:18:13,349 --> 01:18:15,350
To kill him?

1151
01:18:23,655 --> 01:18:25,923
I wasn't the boss of shit.

1152
01:18:27,463 --> 01:18:31,100
[Peter]
I thought that...
I could come here...

1153
01:18:33,256 --> 01:18:35,624
and I could play this cool--

1154
01:18:35,593 --> 01:18:40,997
[Sniffles]
and pretend like I wasn't
a fucking part of it...

1155
01:18:40,842 --> 01:18:43,077
and that I didn't
do anything.

1156
01:18:44,939 --> 01:18:46,840
But I can't.

1157
01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:50,073
[Sniffles]

1158
01:18:50,923 --> 01:18:52,924
Clean hands.

1159
01:18:56,429 --> 01:18:58,363
And I'm--

1160
01:18:59,309 --> 01:19:01,710
I'm so fuckin' sorry.

1161
01:19:07,598 --> 01:19:13,370
I say yes. I say that we all
have just as much responsibility
for him hanging there.

1162
01:19:54,007 --> 01:19:55,841
No, you've gotta
use weight.

[Men Laughing, Chattering]

1164
01:20:19,548 --> 01:20:22,183
[Harry]
Think, uh--

1165
01:20:22,140 --> 01:20:24,207
Think happy thoughts, man.

1166
01:20:25,436 --> 01:20:28,105
[Jack]
You wanna die
and save our asses?

1167
01:20:28,061 --> 01:20:30,429
Come on.
Count me in, hmm?

1168
01:20:33,021 --> 01:20:36,157
- [Harry]
Still gonna do it?
- [Peter] Okay.

1169
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:53,060
[Jack]
Come on. Count me in, hmm?

1170
01:20:53,025 --> 01:20:56,561
[Peter]
That's enough, man.
That's enough, man.

[Choking]

1172
01:21:28,743 --> 01:21:31,345
Well, there it is.

1173
01:21:31,304 --> 01:21:33,305
[Chuckles]

1174
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:37,391
You are one crazy motherfucker.

[Jack Gasps]

1176
01:21:44,746 --> 01:21:47,315
Damn, man.
[Whispers]
Oh, my God!

1177
01:21:48,844 --> 01:21:52,413
What is wrong with that
fucked-up brain of yours, man?

1178
01:21:53,228 --> 01:21:57,464
Unbelievable.
Un-fucking-believable.

1179
01:21:57,357 --> 01:21:59,358
[Harry]
What did that feel like?

1180
01:22:02,029 --> 01:22:04,030
How did that feel?

1181
01:22:05,486 --> 01:22:08,855
How did that feel?

1182
01:22:08,783 --> 01:22:13,120
Is it what everybody says it is?
Is it all-- Make you feel
all powerful and shit?

1183
01:22:26,034 --> 01:22:28,001
[Sighs]

1184
01:22:32,756 --> 01:22:35,357
That is one ugly sight.

1186
01:22:52,311 --> 01:22:54,478

That's all you, man.
