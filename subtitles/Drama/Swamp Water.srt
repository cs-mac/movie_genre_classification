1
00:02:22,015 --> 00:02:24,085
Look. There's the boat.

2
00:02:24,175 --> 00:02:26,564
Let's get over there.

3
00:02:37,175 --> 00:02:40,485
- We won't have to look no further.
- Aye-yippety-aye.

4
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:43,453
They was gator-ate.

5
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:46,732
You spoke the truth, Sheriff Jeb,
ain't no doubt about it.

6
00:02:46,815 --> 00:02:49,283
A mighty big wet place, Okefenokee.

7
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:53,414
I'll say she is, Thursday. 700 miles of nothing.

8
00:02:57,015 --> 00:03:00,451
700 miles ain't gonna see
hide nor hair of me, Marty.

9
00:03:00,535 --> 00:03:03,493
Come on, let's get out of here.
It'll soon be duskdark.

10
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:07,363
We can't get losted, Jeb, not as long as
we can keep sight of that cross.

11
00:03:07,455 --> 00:03:10,447
Maybe not, Tim,
but I can get mighty nervous.

12
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:13,413
Come on, shove her off, Hardy. Let's get.

13
00:03:37,415 --> 00:03:40,452
Trouble. Come back here.

14
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:44,572
Trouble, come back here.

15
00:03:59,815 --> 00:04:01,806
Trouble.

16
00:04:05,175 --> 00:04:07,166
Trouble.

17
00:04:13,975 --> 00:04:15,806
- Morning, Miss Hannah.
- Morning.

18
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:18,489
- Seen my dog?
- No, I ain't.

19
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:24,695
I swear, Hannah, you're a right pretty woman.

20
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:28,290
I don't know how come you ever married
an old man like me.

21
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,605
You ain't no old man.

22
00:04:30,695 --> 00:04:33,289
I wish you wouldn't
go fox-hunting all the time.

23
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:37,254
Always going off with them dogs at duskdark
and leaving me here alone.

24
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:41,613
Hannah, I've been doing it
ever since I was old enough to own a dog.

25
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:45,973
You just can't change us swamp folks.
Look at Ben and that dog of his.

26
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:48,250
I get lonesome.

27
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:52,248
Why, I told you,
your sister could come and live with us.

28
00:04:54,935 --> 00:04:57,927
It ain't my sister I'm lonesome for.

29
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,931
- Going trapping, son?
- No, sir.

30
00:05:11,015 --> 00:05:13,483
My dog ain't back. I'm going at him.

31
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:15,566
Come here, Ben.

32
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:21,094
Yes, sir.

33
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:24,212
You be careful and keep clear of that swamp.

34
00:05:24,295 --> 00:05:27,253
How can I keep clear of Okefenokee?
That's where my dog is.

35
00:05:27,335 --> 00:05:31,328
- You heard me, son.
- When are you coming back, Ben?

36
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:33,645
When I find that fool dog, Miss Hannah.

37
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,727
You be back by tomorrow night
and keep clear of that swamp.

38
00:05:36,815 --> 00:05:38,885
You know where I gotta go to find my dog.

39
00:05:38,975 --> 00:05:42,172
You'll be back here by tomorrow night
or not at all.

40
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:44,052
Ben.

41
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:48,967
- I'll try to get back.
- Don't try. Get back.

42
00:05:49,055 --> 00:05:51,933
- I don't care whether I get back or not.
- That's up to you.

43
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:53,812
Ben.

44
00:05:55,175 --> 00:05:57,370
Goodbye, Miss Hannah.

45
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,045
You ain't never been that hard-minded.

46
00:06:05,135 --> 00:06:09,731
He ain't never headed for
that swamp before, neither.

47
00:06:11,295 --> 00:06:15,129
You've been like
a second mother to him, Hannah.

48
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:17,490
Surely you know how I feel.

49
00:06:17,575 --> 00:06:19,611
Sure I know.

50
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:22,687
A woman don't need no telling.

51
00:06:22,775 --> 00:06:27,929
Trouble with you menfolk is you're afraid
to let on to each other how you feel.

52
00:06:28,015 --> 00:06:30,893
Hello, Ben.

53
00:06:30,975 --> 00:06:34,570
- Howdy, Mabel.
- My goodness. You look like a thundercloud.

54
00:06:34,655 --> 00:06:38,250
- I just had a big fight with my father.
- Whatever for?

55
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,566
- My dog's losted.
- That's nothing to fight about.

56
00:06:41,655 --> 00:06:44,567
- We fit about my going to get him.
- Oh, Ben.

57
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:48,409
What are you laughing about?
I got a right to get my dog, ain't I?

58
00:06:48,495 --> 00:06:52,807
Don't fight with me about it.
Go get your dog if you want.

59
00:06:52,895 --> 00:06:55,728
- That's what I aim to.
- Ben?

60
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:10,845
- Guess you are upset.
- I've got old Trouble on my mind.

61
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:13,847
Well, for heaven's sake, go look for him, then.

62
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,403
That's just what I'm gonna do.

63
00:07:25,135 --> 00:07:27,091
A box of 12-gauge shells, Marty.

64
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:30,645
- Who's a-winning, Dave?
- Well, it's kind of give-and-take.

65
00:07:30,735 --> 00:07:33,886
That old mule of yours
is getting pretty lame, ain't she?

66
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:38,093
Yeah. She's got a nail in her foot.
If I ever get time, I'm gonna pull it out.

67
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:42,054
- You got time to work on me a little?
- I'll take time.

68
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:44,968
Where you heading for, Ben?

69
00:07:45,055 --> 00:07:47,330
Okefenokee.

70
00:07:48,575 --> 00:07:53,171
- You're going into that swamp?
- Yes. I gotta find my dog.

71
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,371
You're going in alone?

72
00:07:55,455 --> 00:07:59,004
- Lessen you want to go with me.
- No, not me.

73
00:07:59,095 --> 00:08:02,371
Hot dang, I can just see you
a-sashaying into that swamp.

74
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:07,973
Yeah, then come hauling-tail outta there
with a bull gator snapping at your britches.

75
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:13,846
- I ain't afraid of no swamp.
- Neither was them trappers we looked for.

76
00:08:15,415 --> 00:08:18,851
- What you trying to do?
- I wanted to see if your hat would fit me.

77
00:08:18,935 --> 00:08:21,813
That's all we're ever gonna find of you.

78
00:08:22,775 --> 00:08:28,372
Doggone that she-housecat.
She throws a litter every time I turn my back.

79
00:08:28,455 --> 00:08:32,243
I'll tell you what we'll do.
You give us a bottle of that red whisky,

80
00:08:32,335 --> 00:08:36,123
and Bud and me'll put all them cats
in one sack and throw 'em in the creek.

81
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:39,127
Sure will.

82
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:42,844
- Be dogged if you ain't made a deal.
- Catch 'em. Get a sack.

83
00:08:44,855 --> 00:08:46,413
Hurry up, Bud.

84
00:08:46,495 --> 00:08:48,406
Here.

85
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:51,328
- That yellow hyena.
- Kitty, kitty.

86
00:08:51,415 --> 00:08:53,451
Behind that barrel. Move.

87
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,924
- Don't let 'em get away.
- No, he ain't here.

88
00:08:56,015 --> 00:09:01,009
- Well, I'll be doggoned. Where did he go?
- He went over there someplace.

89
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:10,087
- Here he is.
- Gimme that cat.

90
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,772
You, young 'un.

91
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,846
Fetch it back.

92
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,083
You hear me?

93
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,733
Why don't you let her have it, Marty?

94
00:09:33,415 --> 00:09:36,452
Give him the cat, you.

95
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:41,734
Maybe we ought to put you
in that croker sack, you little fighting cat.

96
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:45,490
- Fork over that bottle of red-eye, Marty.
- Hurry up.

97
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,565
Ben.

98
00:09:48,655 --> 00:09:52,807
If you aim to rassle them bull gators,
you'll need a swallow of this.

99
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:56,444
No, thanks, Bud. It might taste of cats.

100
00:09:56,535 --> 00:09:58,332
Ben.

101
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:04,006
Cold-out crazy about that dog,
bless Katy if he ain't.

102
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:06,086
Can't nobody stop him now.

103
00:12:27,855 --> 00:12:29,846
Old Trouble.

104
00:16:15,055 --> 00:16:16,966
Who are you?

105
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,052
Ain't you Tom Keefer?

106
00:16:35,255 --> 00:16:40,727
- I'm mighty sorry, bud.
- Sorry you gave me that lick on the head?

107
00:16:40,815 --> 00:16:45,331
I'm mighty sorry
you turned out to know I'm Tom Keefer.

108
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:47,406
You come at me?

109
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,292
No.

110
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,731
No, I come at my dog, that's all.

111
00:16:52,815 --> 00:16:55,727
I didn't even know
you was a-hiding in Okefenokee.

112
00:16:55,815 --> 00:17:00,764
Old Sheriff Jeb figured you got away
to Savannah after you escaped.

113
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:04,814
If you was to let me take my dog and go,
I wouldn't never tell nobody.

114
00:17:04,895 --> 00:17:07,534
I don't expect I could do that.

115
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:10,652
You wouldn't never
find your way outta here anyways.

116
00:17:10,735 --> 00:17:14,694
- You could tell me how to get out.
- I don't expect I could.

117
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:23,404
I reckon I know what happened
to them trappers now.

118
00:17:23,495 --> 00:17:25,725
They was cottonmouth-bit.

119
00:17:25,815 --> 00:17:28,249
I found them dead, all swole up.

120
00:17:28,335 --> 00:17:30,644
I buried 'em up yonder.

121
00:17:30,735 --> 00:17:34,171
- What's your name, bud?
- Ben. Ben Ragan.

122
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:37,133
Thursday Ragan's boy?

123
00:17:37,215 --> 00:17:41,606
Thursday was on the jury
that tried to get me hung.

124
00:17:41,695 --> 00:17:47,213
Well, why don't you go ahead?
You done killed one man, ain't ya?

125
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:51,174
I figured I'd cut the throat
of anyone come at me.

126
00:17:54,815 --> 00:17:57,534
You ain't gonna do it?

127
00:17:57,615 --> 00:18:01,130
But you're in Okefenokee for good, bud.

128
00:18:01,215 --> 00:18:03,888
If I were to let you go back,
you'd tell it on me.

129
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:08,412
- Not if I said I wouldn't.
- Your word don't mean nothing to me.

130
00:18:08,495 --> 00:18:11,134
Not when my living or hanging
is depending on it.

131
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:26,286
Oh, Trouble.

132
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:32,130
Well, I ain't gonna stay, Keefer.
You ain't man enough to keep me here.

133
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:35,844
There ain't but one way
to find your way out of this swamp now.

134
00:18:35,935 --> 00:18:38,324
That's with me a-showing you.

135
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,804
Sure am proud to have me a dog like that.

136
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:43,284
You ain't got him, yet.

137
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:53,530
We'll get out, Keefer, if I have to bash you
in the head when you ain't looking.

138
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:58,894
Bud, there ain't no man living
can catch me when I ain't looking.

139
00:19:06,215 --> 00:19:09,571
Don't you move, Keefer.
I told you I'd get ya.

140
00:19:09,935 --> 00:19:13,814
Now get in that boat.
Take me out of this swamp.

141
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:21,451
I dropped that knife a-purpose, bud.
I figured it was time to learn you a lesson.

142
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,446
Get moving.

143
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:35,486
I hope I didn't hurt you none.
I tried to throw you easylike.

144
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:38,328
Don't need to do me no favours.

145
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:40,929
Next time I'll kill you,

146
00:19:41,015 --> 00:19:43,893
and get out by myself.

147
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,853
I never seen no one so butt-headed.

148
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,848
You're a good man, bud,
but you've gotta give it up now.

149
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:53,324
You're in here for life.

150
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:03,053
Reckon you got plenty to think about.

151
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:08,209
Shep Collins with a load of buckshot
in his heart, and the like of that.

152
00:20:09,295 --> 00:20:13,413
Sometimes I get to thinking about
my poor girl and what's gonna happen to her.

153
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:17,010
You mean to say you got
a woman outside this swamp?

154
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:20,565
I had me the finest woman that ever lived.

155
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:23,965
Couldn't be no other woman for me
after she died.

156
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:27,570
Not even if I could leave this swamp
and live like folks.

157
00:20:27,655 --> 00:20:30,089
What do you mean, then?

158
00:20:30,175 --> 00:20:32,928
I told ya. My young 'un.

159
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:37,850
That's how come I took to the swamp instead
of getting away where I could live like folks.

160
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:40,654
Couldn't bear to be that far away
from my Julie.

161
00:20:40,735 --> 00:20:42,566
Julie?

162
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:46,613
Marty McCord took her in after I was arrested.

163
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:51,246
She does chores and Mrs McCord
gives her rations and a place to sleep.

164
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,724
Sure, I seen her.

165
00:20:55,175 --> 00:20:58,247
- Lately?
- Sure, I seen that gal young 'un.

166
00:20:58,335 --> 00:21:01,133
- She doing all right?
- I reckon so.

167
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:06,246
How come she don't go by the name
of Keefer if she's your young 'un?

168
00:21:06,335 --> 00:21:09,247
Ain't a good name to bear, is it?

169
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:11,610
My wife was a Gordon.

170
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:17,531
When they was gonna hang me, Mrs McCord
promised she'd raise Julie by that name.

171
00:21:18,535 --> 00:21:21,095
Purely fine woman, Mrs McCord.

172
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:23,564
Don't nobody know?

173
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:27,330
Sure. Didn't Thursday never talk about it?

174
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:33,490
Ben,

175
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:38,251
you know, there's a lot of fine folks
outside this swamp.

176
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:44,131
Most people's a whole lot better
than we think they are.

177
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:51,287
And some men's a whole lot worse.

178
00:21:53,055 --> 00:21:55,410
What do you mean?

179
00:21:55,495 --> 00:21:57,292
Who?

180
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,404
What's got into you?

181
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,804
Keefer.

182
00:22:36,895 --> 00:22:39,011
What's wrong?

183
00:22:39,095 --> 00:22:42,007
Man, you're cottonmouth-bit.

184
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:43,892
Keefer.

185
00:22:50,095 --> 00:22:51,892
Keefer.

186
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:21,725
I'm going to get him now, Lord.

187
00:23:21,815 --> 00:23:25,205
There's a dead soul coming,
it ain't nobody but Tom Keefer.

188
00:23:25,295 --> 00:23:29,527
But he died without no hollering
nor cutting the fool.

189
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:35,485
I ain't gonna hold nothin' against him, Lord,
even his trying to steal old Trouble.

190
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:41,605
So if you want to go easy on him for
killing Shep Collins, it'll be all right with me.

191
00:23:41,695 --> 00:23:43,686
Amen.

192
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:47,530
Come on, Trouble.

193
00:24:11,935 --> 00:24:15,484
Never thought to see you
around here no more.

194
00:24:15,575 --> 00:24:18,487
I sort of stayed to bury you.

195
00:24:21,495 --> 00:24:24,805
Looks like I worked all night for nothing.

196
00:24:25,695 --> 00:24:30,052
If I let them things kill me,
I'd have been dead a long time ago.

197
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,774
You got some kind of snake cure?

198
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:37,413
I just make up my mind to get well,

199
00:24:37,495 --> 00:24:43,331
think hard on it, and...
maybe do a little praying.

200
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:47,647
I bet I've been cottonmouth-bit a dozen times.

201
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:52,694
When I found my knife was took,
I figured you'd lit out.

202
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:58,566
No. No, I took it to cut that snake bite,
to make it bleed.

203
00:24:58,655 --> 00:25:01,089
Thanks.

204
00:25:01,175 --> 00:25:05,453
Reckon you can have your gun back
if you want it, Ben.

205
00:25:08,255 --> 00:25:10,325
You ain't a-listening, Miss Hannah.

206
00:25:10,415 --> 00:25:12,485
You better go now, Mr Wick.

207
00:25:12,575 --> 00:25:16,090
How come you can't call me Jesse
like you used to 'fore you was married?

208
00:25:16,175 --> 00:25:18,689
- You better go.
- How come, Miss Hannah?

209
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:22,211
You know how come.
Thursday'd kill any man he catched here now.

210
00:25:22,295 --> 00:25:26,174
He ain't a-catching me. I'm safe
as long as I hear them hounds a-baying.

211
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:30,965
- He won't come back till they catch their fox.
- He ain't fox-hunting, he's hunting Ben.

212
00:25:31,055 --> 00:25:36,129
He's working his way around Okefenokee,
blowing his horn till Ben'll hear it.

213
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:39,890
Thursday holds hisself to blame
for letting Ben get losted.

214
00:25:39,975 --> 00:25:44,332
Ben don't never come back,
I reckon it'll just about kill him.

215
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,366
Somebody's coming.

216
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:51,566
Don't run.

217
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,092
Ben.

218
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:01,891
- Ben.
- Miss Hannah.

219
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:05,047
- Guess you all about gave me up.
- We feared you was dead.

220
00:26:05,135 --> 00:26:08,571
- Howdy, Jesse.
- I was passing by. She asked if I'd seen you.

221
00:26:08,655 --> 00:26:11,772
How come you were away so long?
We feared you was gator-ate.

222
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:14,767
I told you I'd be back when I got ready.
I just got ready.

223
00:26:14,855 --> 00:26:19,246
- I just happened to be passing by.
- You've been in that swamp all this time?

224
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:22,850
Yes. Me and that darn dog
has travelled ourselves half to death.

225
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:25,688
I told her I ain't seen you.
I was just passing by.

226
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:28,164
- Be sure, Jesse.
- I better be a-rambling.

227
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:30,564
Good night, Jesse.

228
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,215
You forgot your guitar.

229
00:26:33,295 --> 00:26:36,014
Thanks, Ben. I was just passing by.

230
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:41,453
- I'll get you something to eat.
- I could sure eat it, Miss Hannah.

231
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:48,086
It's Thursday.

232
00:27:00,095 --> 00:27:02,086
Evening, Thursday.

233
00:27:18,415 --> 00:27:22,010
I told you I'd get back, sir.
And I found old Trouble.

234
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:24,529
You took your time about it.

235
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:29,291
No, sir, I come back as soon as I could.
I catched me a lot of hide animals.

236
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:32,287
I told you to be back here in two days.

237
00:27:32,375 --> 00:27:33,967
I was losted.

238
00:27:34,055 --> 00:27:38,571
Just getting too biggety. I'm still the man
that can slim you down, you hear me?

239
00:27:38,655 --> 00:27:42,694
- I might have been dead.
- You're butt-headed. Just gonna show me.

240
00:27:42,775 --> 00:27:46,085
- You wouldn't care what happened to me.
- I said to be right back.

241
00:27:46,175 --> 00:27:48,370
To show me who's boss.

242
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:51,288
If that's what you think,
that's what I aim to show you.

243
00:27:51,375 --> 00:27:53,013
Thursday.

244
00:27:54,015 --> 00:27:56,370
- Come here.
- I ain't gonna fight my father.

245
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:59,049
- You're gonna stand there and take it.
- No, I ain't.

246
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,569
I'm my own man.
I won't do everything you say.

247
00:28:01,655 --> 00:28:03,486
- Don't be hard on him.
- Quiet.

248
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:06,726
Many a man's gone into Okefenokee
and not come out.

249
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:10,490
Promise me you won't go near that swamp
no more and I won't romp on you.

250
00:28:10,575 --> 00:28:13,885
There's coon and otter in that swamp.
I'm gonna go trapping there.

251
00:28:13,975 --> 00:28:17,854
Not and live under this roof with me,
you ain't.

252
00:28:32,575 --> 00:28:36,614
He's been worrying himself half-crazy
over you, Ben.

253
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:40,083
Well, he won't have to no more.

254
00:28:41,495 --> 00:28:44,726
Please don't go thisaway. He'll get over it.

255
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:46,851
You ought to see I gotta do it.

256
00:28:46,935 --> 00:28:50,052
Ain't right for you to go.
Your father needs you, Ben.

257
00:28:50,135 --> 00:28:52,091
I need you too.

258
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:55,724
I can't tell you why.
I'm scared of something here.

259
00:28:55,815 --> 00:29:00,366
Oh, Ben. I love you like you was my own boy.

260
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:03,686
- Don't go and leave us.
- Don't you worry none, Miss Hannah.

261
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,563
Marty McCord's got an old empty shack
on his place I can get.

262
00:29:07,655 --> 00:29:12,365
I reckon this just had to happen,
so's I could really be my own man.

263
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,570
Goodbye, Miss Hannah.

264
00:29:28,295 --> 00:29:31,173
Julie.

265
00:29:32,135 --> 00:29:34,933
Julie.

266
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:39,409
Julie.

267
00:30:02,615 --> 00:30:04,685
Come here, young 'un.

268
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:07,847
Come here. I've been looking for you.

269
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:11,403
Come on. I ain't gonna hurt ya.

270
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,931
Get inside.

271
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:18,813
Go on. I got something to tell you.

272
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:25,809
I seen your father in the swamp.

273
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:33,533
- We nearly killed each other before I got out.
- My father ain't hiding in no swamp, he ain't.

274
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:39,770
What you scared of? I ain't gonna tell.
Me and him's gonna be partners.

275
00:30:39,855 --> 00:30:42,323
We're gonna trap together. Look here.

276
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:46,643
I already sold Marty some of the hides
we catched. Half this money's yours.

277
00:30:46,735 --> 00:30:49,727
You ain't gonna tell on him?

278
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:55,333
Of course I ain't. We gonna make a raft
of money trapping that swamp, Tom and me.

279
00:30:55,415 --> 00:30:59,169
You get enough money saved up,
Tom wants you to get you some schooling.

280
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:03,806
He don't want you to be no little stray cat
like you are now, dependent on other folks.

281
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,773
I ain't no beggar. I work for my rations.

282
00:31:06,855 --> 00:31:09,733
You needn't get mad about it. Here.

283
00:31:11,255 --> 00:31:14,691
- I ain't no place to hide it.
- Tom says I was to give it to you.

284
00:31:14,775 --> 00:31:18,006
I'd be scared to hold all that.
I ain't never had no money.

285
00:31:18,095 --> 00:31:22,373
I'll keep it for you till I see what Tom says
when I go back into Okefenokee.

286
00:31:22,455 --> 00:31:24,923
Is he all right? Is he sick or anything?

287
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:28,530
Tom Keefer? Can't nothing hurt him.

288
00:31:28,615 --> 00:31:31,254
You better scoot
before Marty's wife misses you.

289
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:34,725
- You keep your mouth shut, mind.
- I mind.

290
00:31:36,775 --> 00:31:39,448
Now, get.

291
00:31:41,415 --> 00:31:44,646
Can't I straighten up for you?

292
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:49,968
I reckon you can at that. If there's one thing
I don't get the hang of, it's making up a bed.

293
00:31:50,055 --> 00:31:54,094
But don't you let nobody see you
a-running over here.

294
00:31:54,175 --> 00:31:57,485
No, you don't, boy. You stay here.

295
00:31:57,575 --> 00:32:00,533
Don't let him out,
or he'll go buck-chasin' again.

296
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:05,609
- Can I feed him?
- Sure. Trouble's like me, he can always eat.

297
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:09,005
Trouble. That's a fine name, ain't it?

298
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,133
Mabel.

299
00:32:12,215 --> 00:32:13,887
Ben.

300
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:17,650
Oh, Ben, I thought
you was never coming back.

301
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:26,610
Go on thinking if it makes you act thisaway.

302
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:30,290
Don't guess this is no way
for a nice girl to behave.

303
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:34,846
That's the way I want my girl to behave
when I come to see her.

304
00:32:35,775 --> 00:32:40,451
- Mabel. I got something to tell you.
- What?

305
00:32:40,535 --> 00:32:42,810
- I run off from home.
- You did?

306
00:32:42,895 --> 00:32:45,773
- Moved into Marty's old shack.
- That old place.

307
00:32:45,855 --> 00:32:49,006
I aim to fill that shack with hides
come wintertime.

308
00:32:49,095 --> 00:32:52,053
There ain't nobody in this town
I'll have to say "sir" to.

309
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:55,332
- I'm my own man now.
- You're just talking big again.

310
00:32:55,415 --> 00:32:58,771
No, I ain't. Gonna get me a saddle horse,

311
00:32:58,855 --> 00:33:03,849
and a fine hound so I can breed old Trouble
and raise some little Troubles.

312
00:33:04,895 --> 00:33:09,332
And not long after that, maybe I'll be
around here with a proposition to make you.

313
00:33:09,415 --> 00:33:12,930
- What kind of a proposition?
- You'll find out.

314
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:17,008
I'm going into Okefenokee. You never seen
the like of hide animals in there.

315
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,883
- You'll lose yourself. I'll never see you again.
- No, I won't.

316
00:33:20,975 --> 00:33:24,604
Yes, you will. Please don't go in there again.

317
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:29,132
- You'll get gator-ate, like those two trappers.
- They was snake-bit.

318
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,685
Man knows his way around like I do
ain't gonna get snake-bit.

319
00:33:32,775 --> 00:33:36,450
How come you know they were snake-bit?

320
00:33:36,535 --> 00:33:39,129
How come you say that?

321
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:41,046
How come?

322
00:33:41,135 --> 00:33:44,650
- Well, I seen where they's buried.
- Who buried 'em?

323
00:33:44,735 --> 00:33:46,965
Who could bury 'em in that swamp?

324
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:50,013
You can ask more doggone questions.

325
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:54,373
Don't get mad about it, Ben. Why don't you
tell me who's a-hiding in the swamp?

326
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:56,764
There ain't nobody a-hiding in the swamp.

327
00:33:56,855 --> 00:34:00,450
If you was to find men that had been
cottonmouth-bit, you'd bury them.

328
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:02,765
Well, that's what I done.

329
00:34:02,855 --> 00:34:05,892
- Promise me you won't tell nobody.
- Why?

330
00:34:07,935 --> 00:34:10,529
They might try to keep me
from going back there.

331
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:16,611
Then my trapping would be over,
and I couldn't make you that proposition.

332
00:34:18,295 --> 00:34:21,128
You know I won't tell nobody, Ben.

333
00:34:21,215 --> 00:34:24,651
After all, I got reasons
for wanting you to make good, ain't I?

334
00:34:24,735 --> 00:34:27,329
Yeah, you sure have.

335
00:34:29,095 --> 00:34:31,484
When you going in the swamp again?

336
00:34:31,575 --> 00:34:34,533
Two or three days.

337
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:38,528
- Supposin' you ain't back for the dance?
- Well, I'll be back.

338
00:34:38,615 --> 00:34:41,573
Yeah, but supposin' you ain't?

339
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:44,692
A girl can't settle down to one, Ben.

340
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:48,006
Especially when he don't show up
unless the notion strikes him.

341
00:34:48,095 --> 00:34:50,973
Why, I told you I'd be back.

342
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:55,726
You better be.

343
00:35:10,415 --> 00:35:13,487
- Howdy, Ben.
- Howdy, Tom.

344
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:18,768
Hadn't ought to be carrying Trouble
in a boat with you.

345
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:22,131
Gator'll turn over a boat to get at a dog.

346
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:25,883
You ought to leave him here with me.

347
00:35:25,975 --> 00:35:28,125
I ain't leaving him nowhere.

348
00:35:28,215 --> 00:35:32,686
- I'd take care of him like he was my own dog.
- Yeah, I reckon you would.

349
00:35:32,775 --> 00:35:36,051
Got a present for you here, mister, see?

350
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:41,089
- You'd steal my dog if I gave you a chance.
- I'd like to, Ben.

351
00:35:41,175 --> 00:35:45,851
But I reckon I can't now,
seeing as how you're my partner.

352
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:04,246
Like another world in here, ain't it?

353
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:08,772
I heard tell that stars is other worlds too.

354
00:36:08,855 --> 00:36:12,643
Big, shining rafts
a-floating in the ocean of God's night.

355
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:18,332
With living things on every raft, just like
there is on this one they call the Earth.

356
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:23,250
Living alone in this swamp's
just like living on another star.

357
00:36:24,215 --> 00:36:27,446
This swamp ain't dangerous as I can see,
like they say.

358
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:32,655
If you know it, it ain't. But you can get lost
and go crazy trying to find your way out.

359
00:36:32,735 --> 00:36:35,568
You got to know things that live here
to get along with them.

360
00:36:35,655 --> 00:36:41,525
Just like you got to know people on the
outside afore you can get along with them.

361
00:36:41,615 --> 00:36:45,085
Speaking of people outside, Ben,

362
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:48,451
you ain't told me yet how my Julie looks.

363
00:36:48,535 --> 00:36:51,368
Well, she looks all right, I reckon.

364
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:54,686
Kinda raggedy.

365
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:58,734
I know how come you could make it
out in this swamp without no gun or nothing.

366
00:36:58,815 --> 00:37:02,524
It's cos you know Indian ways.
I heard tell you knowed a lot about Indians.

367
00:37:02,615 --> 00:37:05,288
I used to hunt with a half-breed
afore my trouble.

368
00:37:05,375 --> 00:37:08,333
Indians knowed a heap of things, Ben.

369
00:37:08,415 --> 00:37:13,409
They buried their dogs with them cos they
figured a dog had a soul just like a man's.

370
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:16,851
I don't see no sense in a thing like that.

371
00:37:16,935 --> 00:37:19,927
You say a dog is dead when he dies.

372
00:37:20,015 --> 00:37:22,529
I don't see how come that should be.

373
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:28,133
Don't he breathe like you? And ain't he got
a heart, and feelings, and a heap of sense?

374
00:37:30,175 --> 00:37:33,247
Look at this skeeter
trying to get his sticker into me.

375
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:36,532
Ain't he got life in him, just like me?

376
00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:41,213
Not now, he ain't.

377
00:37:41,295 --> 00:37:45,447
You ain't killed him.
His life's just gone somewheres else.

378
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:53,448
If you're so sure you're gonna go on living
after you're dead, Tom,

379
00:37:53,535 --> 00:37:56,732
what about that man you killed?

380
00:37:56,815 --> 00:38:00,444
Ain't you gonna be kinda feared
to face Shep Collins up yonder?

381
00:38:00,535 --> 00:38:03,003
I never killed Shep Collins.

382
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:07,564
Why, he was shot dead with your own gun,
wasn't he? I remember that.

383
00:38:07,655 --> 00:38:10,727
Sheriff Jeb tell how you bashed
him in the head and escaped,

384
00:38:10,815 --> 00:38:12,885
just afore he was gonna hang you.

385
00:38:12,975 --> 00:38:17,366
Sure. I wasn't gonna hang
for something I never done.

386
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:23,567
Ain't there no way
to make Sheriff Jeb get at the truth?

387
00:38:23,655 --> 00:38:25,885
No, Ben.

388
00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:29,206
I'm gonna live and die in this old swamp.

389
00:38:29,295 --> 00:38:31,729
But I don't mind,

390
00:38:32,735 --> 00:38:37,525
if my Julie ain't left
to run wild and shift for herself.

391
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:47,212
You're gonna help me take care of her.

392
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:03,214
I wish you'd smile at me, Miss Hannah,
like you used to.

393
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:07,644
I waited for Thursday to go fox-hunting.

394
00:39:07,735 --> 00:39:12,331
As soon as I heard his dog sound off,
I sneaked over here.

395
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:15,766
Listen.

396
00:39:19,895 --> 00:39:24,366
The more little foxes they chase,
the better I like it.

397
00:39:29,735 --> 00:39:33,091
I'd rather you worry about me this way
than about that old man.

398
00:39:33,175 --> 00:39:37,771
I ain't worried about you. Thursday
could break you in pieces with one hand.

399
00:39:37,855 --> 00:39:41,291
The Dorsons might say something about that.
Somebody might get killed.

400
00:39:41,375 --> 00:39:44,845
Why, I seen them once
with my own eyes when...

401
00:39:44,935 --> 00:39:48,052
- You seen what?
- Never you mind. They don't like Thursday.

402
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:53,687
They'd be purely pleased if they had
a good reason to do something about it.

403
00:39:53,775 --> 00:39:57,609
- That's what I'm afeard of.
- Shucks, this ain't no way for us to talk.

404
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:02,211
I'd rather die than quarrel with you.
I'm cold-out crazy about you. You know I am.

405
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:05,492
Go away, Jesse.
Go away and don't never come back no more.

406
00:40:05,575 --> 00:40:07,930
- Hannah, don't go away.
- No.

407
00:40:08,015 --> 00:40:10,813
Go away and leave me alone.

408
00:40:16,695 --> 00:40:19,528
Go away. Please.

409
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:21,128
Please.

410
00:40:22,175 --> 00:40:24,405
- Go away, please.
- Hannah.

411
00:40:24,495 --> 00:40:26,292
Hannah.

412
00:40:35,055 --> 00:40:38,843
- Thursday.
- You stop, sir. Stop, sir.

413
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:59,974
You hear me? Stop, sir.

414
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:10,212
Hannah, where are you?

415
00:41:12,135 --> 00:41:14,933
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

416
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:17,688
Who was it?

417
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,130
Who was it, Hannah?

418
00:41:20,215 --> 00:41:24,606
- You're limpin'. How'd you hurt yourself?
- Never mind my limpin'. I asked who it was.

419
00:41:24,695 --> 00:41:26,526
Why, I...

420
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:29,846
- You know you it was, don't you?
- No. No, I don't know.

421
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:32,574
What do you mean you don't know?
He had hold of you.

422
00:41:32,655 --> 00:41:34,930
I don't know.

423
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:38,371
I didn't reckon for you to lie to me,
Miss Hannah.

424
00:41:38,455 --> 00:41:42,084
I can't tell you, Thursday, I can't.

425
00:41:45,695 --> 00:41:48,289
I kind of begin to see.

426
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,812
- You told him when to come.
- No, I never. He just knowed.

427
00:41:53,895 --> 00:41:56,329
This ain't the first time.

428
00:41:56,415 --> 00:41:58,406
No.

429
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:03,809
I can't hardly believe it, Miss Hannah.
You gotta tell me who it were.

430
00:42:03,895 --> 00:42:05,886
- I can't do that.
- You've got to.

431
00:42:05,975 --> 00:42:10,844
I can't. I know what would happen -
you'd go at him with your gun.

432
00:42:10,935 --> 00:42:16,771
Well, there ain't so many men in this country
I can't figure it out for myself.

433
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:19,323
Tell me how you hurt yourself. I can help you.

434
00:42:19,415 --> 00:42:21,610
No.

435
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:24,289
No, you can't, Miss Hannah.

436
00:42:43,695 --> 00:42:45,367
Si, Si.

437
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:50,324
Come on inside if you want to see
something you never did see afore.

438
00:42:50,775 --> 00:42:53,733
Aye-yippety-aye.
Ain't that a leather-headed old rip?

439
00:42:53,815 --> 00:42:56,283
That's the biggest panther skin I ever seen.

440
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:58,331
- Where'd you catch him?
- In the swamp.

441
00:42:58,415 --> 00:43:01,134
- How'd you get him?
- We got him with buckshot.

442
00:43:01,215 --> 00:43:05,493
- You was with somebody?
- I mean, me and my dog.

443
00:43:05,575 --> 00:43:10,808
I knowed you had a smart dog, Ben,
but I never heard he could handle a shotgun.

444
00:43:10,895 --> 00:43:13,967
- You know what I mean.
- No, I ain't certain, Ben, yet.

445
00:43:14,055 --> 00:43:16,649
- I ain't neither.
- That panther ain't nothing.

446
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:21,047
If you think you're big trappers, you oughta
see the rest of them hides Ben brung in.

447
00:43:21,135 --> 00:43:25,606
Honest to Katy, he's got that old shack
of Marty's just plumb full of otter skins.

448
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:28,767
He sure has. I declare I never seen the like.

449
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:32,450
You'll see a sight better
when we go trapping Okefenokee with Ben.

450
00:43:32,535 --> 00:43:37,893
Bud and me's got more traps than you, but
we'll just share and share alike. How about it?

451
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:40,489
- I ain't taking no partners.
- What you got against us?

452
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:43,806
- I run my traps alone, that's all.
- That's all you're telling.

453
00:43:43,895 --> 00:43:48,207
Never mind. We'll trap that swamp alone
and keep the third share for ourselves.

454
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,412
It can't be so hard to find your way around,
not if you done it.

455
00:43:51,495 --> 00:43:55,966
It took me two weeks to find my way out.
Even my dog didn't know which way to turn.

456
00:43:56,055 --> 00:43:59,968
So you gave him your shotgun to tote
and you found your own way out.

457
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:03,525
I wish you would go into that swamp.
I just wish you would try it.

458
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:06,209
I'm thinking you would find a big surprise.

459
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:10,732
Marty, gimme a bottle of that red liquor.
I want to buy Ben Ragan a drink.

460
00:44:10,815 --> 00:44:13,727
Give him a bottle of that panther water, Marty.

461
00:44:13,815 --> 00:44:19,685
Two drinks of that and they'll go
into the swamp and rassle a bull gator.

462
00:44:22,175 --> 00:44:24,735
- Guess.
- Couldn't be nobody but you, Ben.

463
00:44:24,815 --> 00:44:27,249
- Howdy, Mabel.
- Where you been at so long?

464
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,327
I told you two weeks ago.
Or have you forgot already?

465
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:33,851
- Two weeks is a long time.
- I told you I'd get back for tonight.

466
00:44:33,935 --> 00:44:37,450
I got us a loan of Marty McCord's horse
to take us to the dance.

467
00:44:37,535 --> 00:44:41,733
I'm going with somebody else.
I told you you'd better get back.

468
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:46,684
- I told you I'd get back, and here I am.
- Ben, you ain't the only pebble on the beach.

469
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:49,847
You just expect a girl
to sit around and wait for you.

470
00:44:49,935 --> 00:44:54,929
Well, I waited, waited, and yesterday
when you didn't show up I said yes.

471
00:44:55,015 --> 00:44:57,529
To who?

472
00:44:57,615 --> 00:45:01,403
Good friend. You might as well know who.

473
00:45:01,495 --> 00:45:03,133
It's Miles Tonkin.

474
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:08,084
- Him.
- You sound mighty jealous to me.

475
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:12,134
Why should I getjealous?
I got me a somebody I can take to that dance.

476
00:45:12,215 --> 00:45:15,366
All right, get mad about it.

477
00:45:15,455 --> 00:45:17,446
Who else can you take?

478
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:19,969
That's all right who.

479
00:45:20,055 --> 00:45:22,853
Ain't no other girls in town
that ain't got a man.

480
00:45:22,935 --> 00:45:25,165
I got me a somebody all right.

481
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,723
You're lying, Ben Ragan.

482
00:45:27,815 --> 00:45:33,811
You can't get another girl for that dance
within a day's horse ride, and you know it.

483
00:45:36,855 --> 00:45:39,005
Maybe I'll let you dance with me.

484
00:45:39,095 --> 00:45:42,883
Well, if my friend don't mind.
I can't make no promises.

485
00:45:42,975 --> 00:45:45,967
I'll let you know tonight, Ben.

486
00:45:50,495 --> 00:45:53,885
- Why, hello, Miles.
- Howdy. Howdy, Mabel.

487
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:59,971
What time do you want me to be coming
around to take you to the dance tonight?

488
00:46:03,975 --> 00:46:05,647
Julie.

489
00:46:06,655 --> 00:46:08,646
Hello, Ben.

490
00:46:16,335 --> 00:46:18,326
Mrs McCord.

491
00:46:19,815 --> 00:46:22,852
- Is this a pretty dress?
- It's a beautiful dress.

492
00:46:22,935 --> 00:46:25,813
- How much?
- It's a dollar and a half.

493
00:46:25,895 --> 00:46:28,090
Well, I want it.

494
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,692
What did we come for, Thursday,
if we ain't gonna dance?

495
00:47:23,775 --> 00:47:27,370
We'll keep on coming, Miss Hannah,
till you point him out.

496
00:47:27,455 --> 00:47:31,209
All right. I'll know who it was when I see him.

497
00:47:56,455 --> 00:47:59,572
Howdy, Ben.
Why, Julie. I hardly knowed you.

498
00:47:59,655 --> 00:48:02,692
- She looks pretty.
- Hello, Julie. Hello, Ben.

499
00:48:02,775 --> 00:48:06,484
- Hello, John. Howdy.
- That's a mighty pretty outfit.

500
00:48:16,815 --> 00:48:19,932
Come on back, Julie.

501
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:23,971
- You sure look pert, Julie.
- How come you're here, young 'un?

502
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:27,411
- I brung her, Marty.
- Why, Julie.

503
00:48:27,495 --> 00:48:29,486
Howdy, Mabel.

504
00:49:01,535 --> 00:49:04,288
It's no use, Ben. I can't.

505
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:07,765
Well, let's sit down for a minute, Julie.

506
00:49:09,215 --> 00:49:12,525
- Howdy, Miss Hannah.
- Evening, Ben.

507
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:16,604
- Howdy.
- Howdy.

508
00:49:18,895 --> 00:49:22,092
This here's Miss Julie... Miss Gordon.

509
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,291
Sure. I seen you at Mrs McCord's.

510
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:27,608
You look pretty.
I've been a-watching you with Ben.

511
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:28,810
Thank you.

512
00:49:28,895 --> 00:49:31,284
Ain't you Tom Keefer's young 'un?

513
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:34,014
Yes, sir.

514
00:49:34,095 --> 00:49:36,529
I ain't gonna have nobody running her down.

515
00:49:36,615 --> 00:49:39,971
I don't aim to have words
with none of my kin in public.

516
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:46,051
I didn't mean no offence. You're the one that
seemed ashamed to say her name, not me.

517
00:49:46,135 --> 00:49:49,286
Don't quarrel with him, Ben. He ain't hisself.

518
00:49:49,375 --> 00:49:51,605
He's just mad cos I won't take his bossing.

519
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:57,452
Now, Ben. You go cool off outside
and leave us womenfolk together.

520
00:50:25,335 --> 00:50:28,532
- Good evening, Ben.
- Howdy, Sheriff.

521
00:50:31,815 --> 00:50:34,613
- Ain't dancing, Mr Ragan?
- You know the reason why.

522
00:50:34,695 --> 00:50:37,573
Can't you leave her alone neither?

523
00:50:37,655 --> 00:50:41,853
Thought you was supposed to be
a-courting me, Ben.

524
00:50:44,295 --> 00:50:47,014
So did I.

525
00:50:47,095 --> 00:50:50,610
Hope you don't expect me
to just sit around the house and sew

526
00:50:50,695 --> 00:50:54,404
all the time you're monkeying around
in that old swamp.

527
00:50:54,495 --> 00:50:58,010
I expect nothing from you
but a bossified tongue and a cussing out.

528
00:50:58,095 --> 00:51:00,973
You ain't felt my tongue yet, Ben.

529
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,206
- That's no way to talk.
- I suppose Miles wouldn't talk like that.

530
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,490
No, he wouldn't. He's a gentleman.

531
00:51:07,575 --> 00:51:12,774
Why don't you get back in there and do-si-do
with him so I can dance with my girl?

532
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:16,086
- You little cat.
- You leave me alone.

533
00:51:16,175 --> 00:51:18,405
Leave her alone, Ragan.

534
00:51:29,175 --> 00:51:31,370
Guess he won't bother you no more.

535
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,332
Look out!

536
00:51:33,415 --> 00:51:35,804
Stop them! Stop them!

537
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:40,773
Stop.

538
00:51:40,855 --> 00:51:42,527
Excuse me.

539
00:51:42,615 --> 00:51:44,685
Come on, Ben. Get him.

540
00:51:46,975 --> 00:51:49,808
Get away from me, will you, Mabel?

541
00:52:21,855 --> 00:52:26,531
For the love of Katy, what are you boys
a-fighting about? Who started this ruckus?

542
00:52:26,615 --> 00:52:31,848
Me and Ben was just arguing.
Miles didn't have no call to come butting in.

543
00:52:32,855 --> 00:52:35,927
He fit for you. He can have you.

544
00:52:36,015 --> 00:52:38,813
Take care, Ben.

545
00:52:38,895 --> 00:52:42,205
I got a good idea what you're up to.

546
00:52:42,295 --> 00:52:44,684
You get on home.

547
00:52:50,695 --> 00:52:52,686
Ben?

548
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:58,613
Hardy, you go on back to the dance.

549
00:53:05,535 --> 00:53:07,446
Miles Tonkin.

550
00:53:07,535 --> 00:53:11,653
Wish I'd have come out sooner -
I'd have kicked him.

551
00:53:12,975 --> 00:53:15,728
I reckon he ain't to blame.

552
00:53:16,655 --> 00:53:20,443
Now I know why
you took me to the dance, I guess.

553
00:53:22,935 --> 00:53:24,573
Why?

554
00:53:24,655 --> 00:53:27,374
Cos Mabel McKenzie's your girl.

555
00:53:30,295 --> 00:53:32,684
Not any more she ain't.

556
00:53:34,415 --> 00:53:39,205
Maybe I did so, Julie,
but I'm right proud I took you.

557
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:46,287
It's funny, I never noticed,
you're a heap prettier than Mabel is.

558
00:53:46,375 --> 00:53:50,971
- If you was a little bigger.
- I could grow more, maybe.

559
00:53:52,415 --> 00:53:55,134
From now on I ain't gonna court
nobody else, Julie.

560
00:53:55,215 --> 00:53:57,410
If you've got no objection.

561
00:53:57,495 --> 00:54:00,168
I've got no objection.

562
00:54:00,255 --> 00:54:04,851
I never in my life asked for no kiss,
I always just took 'em.

563
00:54:04,935 --> 00:54:09,531
But dogged if I ain't asking you now, Julie.
Do you mind?

564
00:54:11,135 --> 00:54:13,126
I don't mind.

565
00:54:42,895 --> 00:54:45,853
- That come from Marty's pigpen, didn't it?
- Yes, Ben.

566
00:54:45,935 --> 00:54:47,926
You wait here.

567
00:55:39,295 --> 00:55:42,207
Hurry up, boys. We've been a-waiting for you.

568
00:55:42,295 --> 00:55:44,570
- Howdy, neighbour.
- Howdy, boys.

569
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:47,169
- Where's Thursday?
- His horse went lame.

570
00:55:47,255 --> 00:55:50,850
Turned back to get his gelding,
said to go ahead with the meeting.

571
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:55,451
Well, most of us is here.
Go ahead, Tulle. Let's get down to cases.

572
00:55:55,535 --> 00:56:01,212
Well, men, I hate to say this, but it looks
to me like we got a hog thief amongst us.

573
00:56:01,295 --> 00:56:04,924
It sure does, Tulle. Kiss Katy if it don't.

574
00:56:05,015 --> 00:56:10,487
Howdy. I reckon the somebody you've
come to see is out in the kitchen.

575
00:56:10,575 --> 00:56:15,603
I didn't come to see nobody. Heard you all
was meeting on account on them hog thieves.

576
00:56:15,695 --> 00:56:20,211
Don't know nothing about no thieves. We was
aiming to catch just one of them scoundrels.

577
00:56:20,295 --> 00:56:25,244
- Hope to Katy there ain't two of 'em around.
- Maybe there is.

578
00:56:25,335 --> 00:56:30,045
- Hot dang, what you driving at anyway?
- What do you know about this business?

579
00:56:30,135 --> 00:56:33,764
I got me a good idea them missing hogs
is within ten miles of here.

580
00:56:33,855 --> 00:56:36,767
If they ain't been rafted
down the river and sold.

581
00:56:36,855 --> 00:56:41,246
If you know so much about it, maybe you
had a finger in it. You been away a lot lately.

582
00:56:41,335 --> 00:56:44,930
Yeah. I been away trapping, like you and Bud.

583
00:56:45,015 --> 00:56:48,610
- Why...
- Hold on. You know Ben don't mean nothing.

584
00:56:48,695 --> 00:56:51,163
Don't cut the fool.
This ain't no fooling matter.

585
00:56:51,255 --> 00:56:54,565
I tell you it ain't.
You're getting too big for your breeches.

586
00:56:54,655 --> 00:56:58,489
- Now, now, Bud.
- All of you for coffee?

587
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:14,524
- Coffee, Mr Ragan?
- No, thanks, ma'am.

588
00:57:18,895 --> 00:57:21,728
How's your friend getting on in the swamp?

589
00:57:23,575 --> 00:57:27,204
Well? Why don't you tell Sheriff Jeb
who's a-hiding in the swamp?

590
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:30,048
Might be the hog thief
you've been looking for.

591
00:57:30,135 --> 00:57:32,126
- Coffee?
- Thank you.

592
00:57:32,215 --> 00:57:33,967
- What does she mean?
- I don't know.

593
00:57:34,055 --> 00:57:36,774
- We knew you had somebody in that swamp.
- That right?

594
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:39,688
That's the place a hog thief'd hole up,
in Okefenokee.

595
00:57:39,775 --> 00:57:42,130
Who's a-hiding in that swamp, son?

596
00:57:42,215 --> 00:57:46,208
- Couldn't be Tom Keefer, could it, Ben?
- Tom Keefer.

597
00:57:46,295 --> 00:57:48,763
She's cold-out crazy.

598
00:57:48,855 --> 00:57:53,326
Seems to me you're kinda crazy, Ben,
taking up with that young 'un of Keefer's.

599
00:57:53,415 --> 00:57:56,088
I wouldn't have knowed
who was helping you but for that.

600
00:57:56,175 --> 00:57:58,405
- Be dogged if she ain't right.
- Sure she is.

601
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:01,134
Now I guess you know
where your hog thief is.

602
00:58:01,215 --> 00:58:05,254
Them hog thieves is right here on this porch,
and you know it.

603
00:58:05,335 --> 00:58:07,895
- You'd better shut him up.
- Lookit here, Ben.

604
00:58:07,975 --> 00:58:09,966
Is Tom Keefer in the swamp?

605
00:58:10,055 --> 00:58:12,888
- Answer him, boy.
- Ask her, she knows so much about it.

606
00:58:12,975 --> 00:58:16,934
- We done heard from her, we asking you.
- Is it Keefer in that swamp?

607
00:58:17,015 --> 00:58:20,371
Listen to me, Keefer done a murder.
Are you sticking by him or us?

608
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,811
- He didn't do no murder.
- You gotta tell us where Keefer's at.

609
00:58:23,895 --> 00:58:28,650
- You figured it out for yourself, go get him.
- I will, but you're gonna show us the way.

610
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:31,454
- I got something to say about that.
- I don't think so.

611
00:58:31,535 --> 00:58:35,733
Don't you get in my way, you Dorsons.
Don't you get in my way.

612
00:58:35,815 --> 00:58:38,887
Either you tell or you're gonna get ducked.

613
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:46,814
Wait a minute. Come on, Ben, give up. Make it
easy on yourself. Now's the time to do it.

614
00:58:46,895 --> 00:58:50,410
It's only right we catch that murdering Keefer.
We need your help.

615
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,965
- We aim to have your word afore we leave.
- You sure won't get it.

616
00:58:54,055 --> 00:58:58,651
- Ain't no use argufying with him.
- Let's put him under.

617
00:59:05,895 --> 00:59:08,409
Leave him up, Dorson. Leave him up.

618
00:59:09,415 --> 00:59:12,088
- You ready to talk?
- You'd better say something.

619
00:59:12,175 --> 00:59:15,690
- Say something, Ben.
- Are you gonna say it?

620
00:59:15,775 --> 00:59:17,731
You can't make me.

621
00:59:17,815 --> 00:59:20,283
Let's drown the rat.

622
00:59:33,015 --> 00:59:35,973
Bless Katy, I never see a body so stubborn.

623
00:59:46,615 --> 00:59:48,606
Where's everybody?

624
00:59:49,775 --> 00:59:51,766
Down at the crick.

625
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:06,526
Stop!

626
01:00:09,055 --> 01:00:12,968
You Dorsons, get that boy out of there.
Get away. Get out of the way.

627
01:00:13,055 --> 01:00:16,092
You hear me? Get him out.

628
01:00:16,175 --> 01:00:19,372
- He knows where Keefer's hiding.
- And we're making him tell.

629
01:00:19,455 --> 01:00:21,366
Get him out.

630
01:00:22,975 --> 01:00:24,966
Get him out.

631
01:00:34,975 --> 01:00:38,012
- Untie him.
- We wasn't aiming to harm him none.

632
01:00:38,095 --> 01:00:40,086
Get away, all of you.

633
01:00:46,855 --> 01:00:49,574
Ben. Ben.

634
01:00:56,255 --> 01:00:59,053
You're gonna be all right, son.

635
01:01:07,575 --> 01:01:11,568
If you'd have minded me and kept
out of that swamp like I told you, Ben,

636
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:14,931
you wouldn't be in no fix like you're in.

637
01:01:17,735 --> 01:01:20,010
What's the matter, boy?

638
01:01:21,015 --> 01:01:25,964
If you'll be giving me my clothes,
I'll be taking myself off your hands.

639
01:01:26,055 --> 01:01:28,250
You be quiet now.

640
01:01:33,335 --> 01:01:36,293
You're sick, Ben.

641
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:41,574
I ain't so sick I have to lay here and
listen to you giving me down-the-country.

642
01:01:42,095 --> 01:01:46,373
I knowed that was all
you drug me out of that crick for.

643
01:01:46,455 --> 01:01:49,447
I drug you out because you was my boy.

644
01:01:50,775 --> 01:01:53,448
You're home, Ben.

645
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,323
You and me ain't gonna have
no more disputes.

646
01:02:06,615 --> 01:02:08,606
Howdy, Matt.

647
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:19,645
Howdy, Mrs McCord. Marty here?

648
01:02:30,535 --> 01:02:34,050
- Take them out of here.
- I've brung 'em to sell, same as always.

649
01:02:34,135 --> 01:02:37,127
- Take 'em out.
- What's wrong with them hides?

650
01:02:37,575 --> 01:02:41,045
I can smell Tom Keefer on 'em.

651
01:02:41,135 --> 01:02:43,649
I figured you wouldn't hold
nothing against me.

652
01:02:43,735 --> 01:02:48,126
If you aim to have truck with such as Keefer,
aim to sell his hides somewheres else.

653
01:02:48,215 --> 01:02:51,252
- Where else?
- Take 'em to Savannah like I have to.

654
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:54,247
I ain't got no way to get to Savannah.
That's too far.

655
01:02:54,335 --> 01:02:56,644
Well, you'll have to get them out of here.

656
01:02:56,735 --> 01:03:00,523
- How am I gonna make my living?
- Well, that's up to you.

657
01:03:00,615 --> 01:03:04,130
My wife says to tell you
to clear out that shack too.

658
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:07,695
I'm fixing to clear out.

659
01:03:08,695 --> 01:03:10,845
- Marty?
- Yeah?

660
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:13,244
Are y'all going fox-hunting tonight?

661
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:15,451
Yeah. We're a-hunting.

662
01:03:15,535 --> 01:03:18,732
I'm sure gonna miss that dog of yourn.

663
01:03:23,215 --> 01:03:25,206
Goodbye, Mrs McCord.

664
01:03:32,455 --> 01:03:34,446
Howdy, Sheriff.

665
01:03:52,415 --> 01:03:54,485
Julie.

666
01:03:55,095 --> 01:03:57,165
Oh, Julie.

667
01:03:57,255 --> 01:04:00,088
You told 'em. You told on him.
You told on my father.

668
01:04:00,175 --> 01:04:03,167
- I didn't aim to...
- You didn't have no right to do it.

669
01:04:03,255 --> 01:04:06,406
Now they're gonna catch him.
I heard Sheriff Jeb tell it.

670
01:04:06,495 --> 01:04:08,565
Them Dorsons is gonna help.

671
01:04:08,655 --> 01:04:12,409
- You're worse than that Miles Tonkin.
- You don't know how it happened.

672
01:04:12,495 --> 01:04:15,567
I ain't gonna speak to you again.
I won't come to the shack.

673
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:18,772
I ain't gonna cook your food
or make your bed. I ain't.

674
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:22,643
Ain't nobody gonna catch your father
because I ain't gonna leave them.

675
01:04:22,735 --> 01:04:24,214
Oh, Ben.

676
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:27,605
I ain't never gonna
believe you again. Never.

677
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:29,606
You gotta trust me.

678
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,846
Ain't I always told you the truth?
Ain't I kept money for you?

679
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:37,372
I ain't gonna touch it. Keep the money
or throw it away. I won't never touch it.

680
01:04:37,455 --> 01:04:42,210
I was only a-saving it for him.
Now you've killed him.

681
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,331
No, I ain't neither, I tell you.

682
01:04:44,415 --> 01:04:46,406
Julie.

683
01:05:01,495 --> 01:05:04,328
Down, Dorcas, down.

684
01:05:22,255 --> 01:05:27,124
Listen to them, Trouble. That's
a stomp-down good race they're having.

685
01:05:27,895 --> 01:05:30,807
That old grey fox is leading 'em
on a run now, ain't she?

686
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:35,329
Let's me and you slip and go, irregardless.

687
01:05:35,415 --> 01:05:38,248
Best stay here tonight.

688
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:43,368
Don't reckon you need
to wait for no invitation.

689
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:08,090
Miss Hannah.

690
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:11,770
- What's wrong 'tween you and him?
- I can't tell you.

691
01:06:11,855 --> 01:06:14,608
How come?

692
01:06:14,695 --> 01:06:17,129
I couldn't stand it if you got down on me too.

693
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:19,775
Is it something you done?

694
01:06:25,175 --> 01:06:27,643
Maybe it'll make me feel better if I tell you.

695
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:36,566
Dorcas.

696
01:06:38,055 --> 01:06:40,615
Ever since then, Thursday don't go nowhere.

697
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:45,052
Just sits around here watching me,
waiting for that man to come back.

698
01:06:45,135 --> 01:06:49,208
I told him it wouldn't happen no more,
but he won't listen.

699
01:06:50,215 --> 01:06:53,207
I've been wishing I were dead.

700
01:06:54,375 --> 01:06:58,288
I didn't ever reckon
it was nothing like that, Miss Hannah.

701
01:06:59,295 --> 01:07:02,287
I wish I hadn't a-told you.

702
01:08:02,415 --> 01:08:04,087
Thursday?

703
01:08:04,175 --> 01:08:06,814
It's not Thursday, Jesse. It's me.

704
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:11,046
- Oh, Ben.
- Were you expecting Thursday?

705
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,126
Why should I?

706
01:08:14,735 --> 01:08:19,934
Course, if you got anything to say to him,
Jesse, I know where you can find him.

707
01:08:20,015 --> 01:08:25,726
- I ain't got nothing to say to him.
- Maybe he'd have something to say to you.

708
01:08:25,815 --> 01:08:30,969
I ain't never done no harm to Thursday.
I never done nothing to him.

709
01:08:31,055 --> 01:08:36,254
What do you think he'd say
if I was to tell him where I found your guitar?

710
01:08:36,335 --> 01:08:39,645
Go ahead and tell him.
He won't come near me, he'd be afraid.

711
01:08:39,735 --> 01:08:42,124
He'd break you into a thousand pieces.

712
01:08:42,215 --> 01:08:47,448
I got friends looking out for me. You know
what they'd do. They gave you a taste of it.

713
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:51,574
The Dorsons. I was forgetting about them.

714
01:08:51,655 --> 01:08:56,251
Yes, siree. The Dorsons ain't
gonna let nothing happen to me.

715
01:09:06,015 --> 01:09:08,734
What are you looking at me that way for?

716
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:11,807
What are you saving that for, Jesse?

717
01:09:16,015 --> 01:09:18,006
That?

718
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:21,935
I got lots of things.

719
01:09:22,015 --> 01:09:24,006
Yeah, that's right.

720
01:09:29,655 --> 01:09:34,046
You was quite a big man at that trial,
wasn't you, Jesse?

721
01:09:34,135 --> 01:09:37,286
There was only three witnesses
agin Tom Keefer.

722
01:09:37,375 --> 01:09:41,766
There was Bud and Tim Dorson, and you -
all telling the same story, word for word.

723
01:09:41,855 --> 01:09:44,085
Three agin one, that right?

724
01:09:44,175 --> 01:09:49,807
- We only told what we saw.
- Yeah. Maybe you did and maybe you didn't.

725
01:09:49,895 --> 01:09:52,807
I know Tom Keefer,
I know he couldn't commit no murder.

726
01:09:52,895 --> 01:09:55,967
But you could.
And so could Bud and Tim Dorson.

727
01:09:56,055 --> 01:10:00,287
- You're crazy. I wouldn't kill a kitten.
- No, well, maybe you didn't.

728
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:03,094
But now I'm beginning to see the light.

729
01:10:03,175 --> 01:10:06,929
I'm beginning to understand why
them Dorsons always stand up for you,

730
01:10:07,015 --> 01:10:09,290
and why you always trail around after them.

731
01:10:09,375 --> 01:10:13,084
No, Ben. There ain't nothing like that.
You're wrong, Ben.

732
01:10:13,175 --> 01:10:16,531
No, I'm not wrong, Jesse. You killed him.

733
01:10:16,615 --> 01:10:19,971
Or the Dorsons done it and you seen 'em.
That's it.

734
01:10:20,055 --> 01:10:22,330
It's just as plain as the look on your face.

735
01:10:22,415 --> 01:10:26,693
You're just as guilty as they are,
and if they hang for it, you're gonna hang too.

736
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:30,165
Don't talk like that, Ben. I ain't done nothing.

737
01:10:30,255 --> 01:10:33,611
The only chance for you
to save your hide is to tell the truth, now.

738
01:10:33,695 --> 01:10:37,483
I can't do that. I can't, Ben.
Bud Dorson would kill me.

739
01:10:37,575 --> 01:10:41,488
Bud won't kill nobody. You speak your piece,
I'll get Keefer to back you up.

740
01:10:41,575 --> 01:10:43,964
Then the Dorsons'll be
at the wrong end of a rope.

741
01:10:44,055 --> 01:10:47,013
I can't do it, Ben. I can't do anything like that.

742
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:50,132
All right, Jesse. You just suit yourself.

743
01:10:50,615 --> 01:10:55,325
But either you come with me right now to see
Sheriff Jeb or I'm taking you to Thursday.

744
01:10:55,415 --> 01:10:58,373
You ain't got no other choice -
Sheriff Jeb or Thursday.

745
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:04,564
I'd choose Sheriff Jeb, make a clean breast
of it and get free of them Dorsons for good.

746
01:11:04,655 --> 01:11:07,169
All right. Come on, it's one or the other.

747
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:18,253
See? Ain't no Dorsons there.

748
01:11:25,215 --> 01:11:27,365
I can't do it, Ben. I can't do it.

749
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:33,451
It's too late to back down now. Ain't nobody
gonna harm you for telling the truth.

750
01:11:44,775 --> 01:11:46,766
Ben Ragan, what are you a-doing here?

751
01:11:46,855 --> 01:11:49,528
Jesse's got something to tell you, Sheriff Jeb.

752
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:52,607
Then it's purely up to you what I do.

753
01:11:53,615 --> 01:11:55,890
Well, go on, Jesse. Don't be ascared.

754
01:11:55,975 --> 01:11:58,967
Tell them who killed Shep Collins.

755
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,527
What I said in court wasn't true.

756
01:12:07,215 --> 01:12:09,206
Julie.

757
01:12:11,255 --> 01:12:13,815
Julie, you inside?

758
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:16,728
Go away. You ain't got no right here.

759
01:12:16,815 --> 01:12:20,091
- I gotta see you.
- I don't never want to see you no more.

760
01:12:20,175 --> 01:12:23,929
But you don't understand.
I'm going in the swamp to get your father.

761
01:12:24,015 --> 01:12:26,575
You're getting him so they can hang him.

762
01:12:26,655 --> 01:12:30,648
No, Julie. It ain't what you think.
He's a-coming out for good.

763
01:12:30,735 --> 01:12:34,523
I done fixed everything.
I made Jesse Wick tell the truth.

764
01:12:34,615 --> 01:12:38,813
They wouldn't believe my father,
they ain't gonna believe no Jesse Wick.

765
01:12:38,895 --> 01:12:41,204
That's why I'm bringing your father out.

766
01:12:41,295 --> 01:12:44,924
Sheriff Jeb's got Jesse Wick's affidavit.
He can't go back on that.

767
01:12:45,015 --> 01:12:47,483
Tomorrow he'll have Tom's.

768
01:12:47,575 --> 01:12:50,885
Let me talk to you, Julie. Let me see you.

769
01:12:52,815 --> 01:12:54,806
Julie.

770
01:13:27,015 --> 01:13:30,564
You sure he can come out?
And no one'll hurt him?

771
01:13:31,295 --> 01:13:33,650
I'm plumb sure, Julie.

772
01:13:34,655 --> 01:13:37,772
Bright and early in the morning
they're gonna pick you up

773
01:13:37,855 --> 01:13:43,088
and take you right in Sheriff Jeb's boat
down to meet your daddy.

774
01:13:44,335 --> 01:13:48,374
And I ain't gonna say a word to Tom
about you waiting there, Julie.

775
01:13:48,455 --> 01:13:50,889
We're gonna surprise him.

776
01:13:50,975 --> 01:13:54,251
Show him how pretty you growed up to be.

777
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:58,328
We can live on our farm again - like folks.

778
01:13:58,415 --> 01:14:00,883
That's just the way it's gonna be, Julie.

779
01:14:00,975 --> 01:14:05,605
All Tom's troubles is over,
past and gone and forgotten.

780
01:14:06,735 --> 01:14:13,413
You know what he said to me once? Living
in the swamp was like living on another star.

781
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:17,204
Now it'll be like coming back
into the world again.

782
01:14:17,295 --> 01:14:20,128
- Ben. Oh, Ben.
- Julie.

783
01:14:43,215 --> 01:14:45,604
Not now, you fool.

784
01:14:55,575 --> 01:14:57,850
- Howdy, Ben.
- Howdy.

785
01:14:57,935 --> 01:15:01,814
Sure glad to see you. For the first time
in years I've been real lonesome.

786
01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:04,614
I've been missing this old hound here.

787
01:15:04,695 --> 01:15:07,846
- Get in this canoe, Tom.
- How come?

788
01:15:07,935 --> 01:15:10,972
I've come to take you out of the swamp.

789
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:16,605
I got a confession from Jesse Wick.
Sheriff Jeb said that you can come out free.

790
01:15:16,695 --> 01:15:20,813
All you have to do is face them Dorsons
and everything'll be like it was before.

791
01:15:20,895 --> 01:15:24,683
- You ain't one to joke, are you?
- It's the God's truth. You're free.

792
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:28,245
You and Julie is gonna live again like folks.

793
01:15:28,335 --> 01:15:31,293
- You mean I can just up and go out of here?
- Sure I do.

794
01:15:31,375 --> 01:15:37,132
Sheriff Jeb and Marty are gonna be waiting
at the gator hole at the edge of the swamp.

795
01:15:37,215 --> 01:15:41,174
There's a trick in that.
All they want to do is get their hands on me.

796
01:15:41,255 --> 01:15:44,406
You must be crazy, Tom.
My own father'll be there.

797
01:15:44,495 --> 01:15:48,488
And Hardy and Fred Ulm and John Dekle
and Marty McCord, like I told you.

798
01:15:48,575 --> 01:15:50,645
I never figured you wouldn't believe me.

799
01:15:50,735 --> 01:15:53,568
- They talked you into it, Ben.
- No, they ain't, Tom.

800
01:15:53,655 --> 01:15:56,886
They done talked you into it.
All they want to do is catch me.

801
01:15:56,975 --> 01:16:02,208
- They was always agin me and they still is.
- I'm telling you the truth. I ain't agin you.

802
01:16:02,295 --> 01:16:07,733
If I was, I'd have brought them in here,
wouldn't I? I wouldn't be taking you out.

803
01:16:07,815 --> 01:16:12,366
Maybe so, but if you're wrong, I'm the one
that has to pay for it. You know that.

804
01:16:12,455 --> 01:16:14,571
I told you who'd be waiting there.

805
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:19,649
If their word ain't no good,
the word of the Holy Bible ain't, I reckon.

806
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:26,084
It's like being dead all these years.

807
01:16:27,095 --> 01:16:32,215
Now you're a-telling me
to come back to life again.

808
01:16:35,695 --> 01:16:38,084
I gotta be alone a minute, Ben.

809
01:16:44,935 --> 01:16:46,926
Trouble.

810
01:16:52,895 --> 01:16:55,693
You stay here, you old fool.

811
01:17:07,135 --> 01:17:09,126
Won't be no more hiding now.

812
01:17:09,215 --> 01:17:12,810
Afore long you'll be eating your own corn
and roasting your own shoats.

813
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:15,648
Yeah, and Julie'll roast it for me.

814
01:17:15,735 --> 01:17:17,771
Do you know, Ben, can she cook?

815
01:17:17,855 --> 01:17:19,846
Sure she can. Right good.

816
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:23,132
Say, Ben, tell me, how does she look?

817
01:17:23,215 --> 01:17:24,887
Is she pretty?

818
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:27,853
Well, Tom, I wouldn't exactly say
she took after you.

819
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,610
Well, no. I don't reckon she got no whiskers.

820
01:17:37,615 --> 01:17:41,369
You take Keefer.
I want that squealing shoat of a Ragan.

821
01:17:41,455 --> 01:17:44,174
Around that turn,
we'll be in sight of the cross.

822
01:17:44,255 --> 01:17:48,248
- Only couple more minutes.
- They'll all be waiting to tell me I'm free.

823
01:17:48,335 --> 01:17:51,566
That's right. The whole lot of them.

824
01:17:51,655 --> 01:17:53,805
- Did you get 'em?
- I ain't sure.

825
01:17:53,895 --> 01:17:55,692
Shove over to the other bank.

826
01:18:01,095 --> 01:18:03,484
Come up around behind them.

827
01:18:15,655 --> 01:18:18,692
- You was lying.
- No, I wasn't.

828
01:18:18,775 --> 01:18:24,054
You set 'em on me. I should've cut your throat
the first time you came at me, like I wanted to.

829
01:18:24,135 --> 01:18:27,969
- Why, you're crazy, Tom.
- I was crazy to trust you.

830
01:18:28,055 --> 01:18:33,288
I'd be crazy to trust anyone. I thought there
was good people in the world, but they ain't.

831
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,809
We can't stay and talk.
Them Dorsons is coming.

832
01:18:35,895 --> 01:18:38,773
You know who it is?
That proves you sicked 'em on me.

833
01:18:38,855 --> 01:18:41,608
It couldn't be nobody else.
Jesse must've told 'em.

834
01:18:41,695 --> 01:18:46,689
- You mean you told 'em.
- They hate me as bad as they do you.

835
01:18:46,775 --> 01:18:50,609
I'm your friend, Tom, I swear it.
I wouldn't do nothing like this to you.

836
01:18:50,695 --> 01:18:53,812
- We'll find out.
- What do you mean? How?

837
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,568
We'll prove it. Show yourself to 'em.

838
01:18:56,655 --> 01:19:02,013
Show yourself to 'em, and if they don't shoot,
I'll know you're on their side.

839
01:19:02,095 --> 01:19:03,369
Trying to get me killed?

840
01:19:03,455 --> 01:19:07,767
I'm trying to find out if there's anyone
in the world that can speak the honest truth.

841
01:19:07,855 --> 01:19:13,088
You needn't be afraid. They ain't gonna shoot
at you. Because you're in cahoots with 'em.

842
01:19:13,175 --> 01:19:15,894
Now, go on. Show yourself.

843
01:19:15,975 --> 01:19:18,250
Go on. Show yourself.

844
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:24,491
All right, Tom.
If that's what you think, I'll show you.

845
01:20:09,375 --> 01:20:12,014
- Are you hurt, bud?
- I don't reckon so.

846
01:20:12,095 --> 01:20:14,609
I'm sorry, Ben.

847
01:20:14,695 --> 01:20:18,370
We gotta get them cooters. This way, Ben.

848
01:20:38,655 --> 01:20:43,934
When they shoot again,
make out like you was hit, then follow me.

849
01:20:51,335 --> 01:20:54,327
Got him, Tim. We can rush Keefer.

850
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:00,650
No, Ben. Around.

851
01:21:02,375 --> 01:21:05,765
Leave something here. Drop yourjacket.

852
01:21:18,495 --> 01:21:21,214
That's a bog hole. It'll suck you right under.

853
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:27,088
Look. There ahead, yonder.

854
01:21:29,695 --> 01:21:31,526
Tim, hurry.

855
01:21:31,615 --> 01:21:34,607
I'm sinking. Get me out of here. Hurry.

856
01:21:34,695 --> 01:21:37,129
Here. Hold the rifle butt. Hang onto that gun.

857
01:21:37,215 --> 01:21:40,287
Tim. I'm sinking in this mud. Hurry. Hurry.

858
01:21:40,375 --> 01:21:42,969
Stay out there, Tim. Pull. Go on, pull.

859
01:21:43,055 --> 01:21:46,172
You ain't pulling, Tim. Tim, darn it.

860
01:21:46,255 --> 01:21:49,452
- Don't let me die in this mud.
- I'm pulling you.

861
01:21:49,535 --> 01:21:54,290
Don't you understand?
Don't let me die in Okefenokee.

862
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:57,128
Pull me out.

863
01:21:57,215 --> 01:22:00,491
Tim. Tim.

864
01:22:07,815 --> 01:22:09,806
Bud.

865
01:22:21,535 --> 01:22:25,733
All right, Ben.
He ain't gonna do nothing. Get up.

866
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,806
Get up.

867
01:22:32,895 --> 01:22:36,649
It's too bad about Bud, Tim,
but maybe it's better that way.

868
01:22:37,455 --> 01:22:41,414
- Reckon he won't have to hang, anyway.
- No.

869
01:22:41,495 --> 01:22:44,055
Don't sound so good to you, does it, Tim?

870
01:22:44,135 --> 01:22:50,085
Didn't sound good to me when the judge said
I had to hang for a murder you and Bud done.

871
01:22:50,175 --> 01:22:55,932
And all this time you been living free in
the outside world, along with all the people.

872
01:22:56,015 --> 01:22:59,690
I never done no murder, Tim,
but you sent me in here to live.

873
01:22:59,775 --> 01:23:02,847
700 miles of swamp and wilderness.

874
01:23:02,935 --> 01:23:05,654
And not a human being.

875
01:23:05,735 --> 01:23:08,329
But I lived.

876
01:23:08,415 --> 01:23:11,088
Maybe you'll be able to live too.

877
01:23:11,175 --> 01:23:13,769
Cos that's where you're heading
right now, Tim.

878
01:23:13,855 --> 01:23:17,245
If you can learn to live
with cottonmouths and gators and panthers

879
01:23:17,335 --> 01:23:20,327
and places where there ain't
a bit of ground to stand on,

880
01:23:20,415 --> 01:23:22,531
I reckon you're welcome to your life.

881
01:23:22,615 --> 01:23:24,606
Now get going.

882
01:23:34,815 --> 01:23:36,806
Get going.

883
01:23:41,335 --> 01:23:46,853
And if you ever find your way out, Sheriff
Jeb'll be waiting with a rope to hang you.

884
01:23:56,615 --> 01:23:58,446
Come on, Trouble.

885
01:24:06,975 --> 01:24:09,170
Our boat's up beyond a-ways, Tom.

886
01:24:09,255 --> 01:24:13,407
I've been thinking, Ben, maybe
you'd better take me back to my island.

887
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:17,283
What for, Tom?
You're coming with me to your Julie.

888
01:24:17,375 --> 01:24:22,210
I ain't sure I can live out there again,
and this is my home.

889
01:24:23,495 --> 01:24:27,329
Maybe I'd better make sure
Tim Dorson is good and losted.

890
01:24:27,415 --> 01:24:29,531
You can't do that, Tom.

891
01:24:29,615 --> 01:24:33,528
Julie's waiting for you,
and all the folks you used to know and love.

892
01:24:35,895 --> 01:24:38,932
That's them. Come on, now, Tom.

893
01:24:39,935 --> 01:24:45,168
Julie. You want to see her, don't you?
You wouldn't want to hurt her.

894
01:24:50,095 --> 01:24:52,086
There they come.

895
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:54,166
There's Julie.

896
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:56,132
Hello.

897
01:24:56,215 --> 01:24:59,332
Daddy. Daddy.
