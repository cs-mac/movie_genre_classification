1
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,679
Aalst, Belgium - end of the 19th century

2
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,375
Pick up those bobbins!
Put that basket away!

3
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,940
Watch out!

4
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,754
What's this?

5
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,990
Go on, pick it up.

6
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,672
Pick that up!

7
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,836
If you don't work - then get out!
Get out, bitch!

8
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,096
And you, 20 centimes fine!

9
00:01:45,122 --> 00:01:46,056
I didn't do anything!

10
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:49,033
20 cents or you're out too.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,871
Professor Daens,

12
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,332
is it true that you want to leave
the college of Dendermonde

13
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:13,157
or not?

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,358
I've had nine beautiful years,
Monseigneur. That's enough.

15
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,911
You've had nine years of troubles
with everybody.

16
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,795
Them with me, maybe.
I won't deny that.

17
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,752
Anyhow,
now I want to go to Aalst.

18
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,511
I have a spot for you as a junior priest
in Drongen.

19
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,398
You're expected there tomorrow.

20
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,634
You know very well that I've had
real problems in Drongen.

21
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,717
And indeed, with everybody.
I remember, because you still have.

22
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,152
I don't think I'm welcome there.

23
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,074
You can hold your own.
You are making it difficult.

24
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,189
Shouldn't you consider in peace
what you actually want?

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,834
- You're not happy anywhere!

26
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,238
You're right, Monseigneur. That's
why I'm leaving for Aalst tomorrow.

27
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,400
If you really need me,
you can find me there.

28
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,640
Please, Lord,
free us from Daens.

29
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,554
In the name of the father,
Son and Holy Ghost. Amen!

30
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,395
May St. Ursula protect our factory
in these troubled times.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,597
Hail Mary, Mother of God.
Lord be with you,

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,355
blessed above all women
and blessed is your Son Jesus.

33
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,640
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us, now and forever. Amen.

34
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,390
You there! Get out!

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,640
There, there are more!

36
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,640
There's Nini!

37
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,777
Those coals are ours. Get out!

38
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,740
You don't need coals.

39
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,640
Aalst! Two-minute stop!

40
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,640
Two-minute stop.

41
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,638
And? Where are these socialists?

42
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,908
- All this panic for nothing!

43
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,476
Well, well! Father Daens!

44
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,351
Adolf... What a surprise!

45
00:05:50,877 --> 00:05:53,043
Am I not welcome?

46
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,261
Or is Aalst yours only now?

47
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:56,336
No, no.

48
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,473
But the bishop did not inform us.

49
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,304
- Where do I send this, Father?

50
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,453
To my brother's,
printer Daens.

51
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,877
Read "Forwards"!
The socialist paper!

52
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,350
Read "Forwards"!
The socialist paper!

53
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,678
Please sirs, for you it's free!

54
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,594
Don't hit me!

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,975
According to Belgian
law, I can...

56
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,617
I'm the law here

57
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,752
you can nothing. Back to Ghent!

58
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:41,633
Guys, dirty Lisette has potatoes.

59
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,912
Lisette!

60
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,975
Gee, what a potato.

61
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:54,417
My potatoes!

62
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,876
There's another fat one.

63
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,043
Thieves!

64
00:06:59,069 --> 00:07:00,576
Let's go, fellows. Run!

65
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,153
My potatoes! Thieves!
Bunch of bastards!

66
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,919
What are you doing?
This is no cemetery or dunghill.

67
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,085
- Why are you
bringing this here?

68
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:15,303
- Throw them away at your place.

69
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,637
Throw it away!
I'm fed up with this child.

70
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,756
Look there!

71
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:25,835
Father, do you agree with him?
Dumping his corpses here.

72
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,753
What can I do with it?

73
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,237
It's not up to me to bury her.

74
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,591
Besides, I need my cart.
I've got work to do.

75
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,473
- What happened?
- Frozen to death, Father. Feel it.

76
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,192
It's the same every day.

77
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,920
Farmers find them and bring them
here instead of burying them.

78
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,233
Does anybody know her?

79
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,221
- Everyone knows her, Father.

80
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,989
Nini, with the wet cherry.

81
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,869
So, potato-thief, maybe you also
know where her parents are?

82
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,715
Yes, over there somewhere.
Around the corner, under the bar.

83
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,140
"Whose arse is this.

84
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,840
Whose arse is that.

85
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,940
Whose arse may this well be.

86
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,640
But man, this is the coal bag.

87
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,640
That coal bag belongs to me..."

88
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,470
Fellows, they've released a crow!

89
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,955
Cover your bum, your man is here!

90
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,238
Gust! That's a priest!

91
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,150
You're not looking for favours
around here, do you Father

92
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,878
or are you looking for the devil?

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,757
- I'm looking for Nini's parents.
- Hot Nini, with the wet cherry?

94
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:12,674
Gust!
Over there, Father.

95
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,549
Listen, if you're here
to lecture us, don't bother!

96
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,712
And certainly not about that whore.

97
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,298
It's everyone for himself here.
And our poor-box is empty.

98
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,272
But...

99
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,545
do you know what
happened to her?

100
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,242
Did you see her?

101
00:09:46,368 --> 00:09:48,514
She's banged up. We know.

102
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,533
And leave my man alone.
None of your business!

103
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,590
- Indeed.
This is the one.

104
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,230
Red swine, I didn't do anything.

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,914
You haven't either, did you, Jef?

106
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,709
She liked it.
She came to ask for it herself.

107
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,434
Here.

108
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,955
Don't let them bury her like a dog.

109
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,674
Buy her a coffin.

110
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,149
- Hey, more thieves!
- Uncle Adolf!

111
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:59,075
- Are those boxes for us?
- Of course! Choose, you skunks!

112
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,870
Adolf...
gee! It's been a long time!

113
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,520
Can I move in here?

114
00:11:05,746 --> 00:11:07,102
Run off again?

115
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:10,073
I hate priests,
the college makes me sick.

116
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,437
I could teach you in private
and finally pay you back.

117
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,639
Don't be silly. you're welcome!
Peter will be glad!

118
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,509
- I hear you're still kind to your readers.
- Adolf!

119
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,476
What a surprise!

120
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,632
- Travelling through?
- No, I'm staying!

121
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,190
Does your bishop allow this?

122
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,396
Here, competition.

123
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,790
You trust yourself on the streets
with such a newspaper?

124
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,511
Where did you get it?

125
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,513
A socialist's gift at the station.

126
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,037
- Any room for me on the front page?
- If you want...

127
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,570
ENOUGH DEAD CHILDREN IN AALST

128
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,398
Did you read this, Borremans?

129
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,156
A catholic paper against our ideas
agitating the workers against us.

130
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,103
You must talk
about it to Woeste.

131
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,819
You do it. There he is.

132
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,358
Have you read it Mr. Chairman?

133
00:12:34,384 --> 00:12:36,695
I'm aware, my friends.

134
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,317
I will bring reason to
that little printer.

135
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,234
It's going too far.
Aalst is getting more dangerous by the day.

136
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,996
They insult and loot us
and threaten our women.

137
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,958
They terrorise the country
and this newspaper.

138
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,350
- Don't exaggerate, Druwe.
- Do I?

139
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,398
- Let's not waste our time.

140
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,189
That paper I can handle.

141
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,550
These workers shouldn't bite

142
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:07,735
the hands that feed them.

143
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,577
The church should take care of that.

144
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,056
As an employer you take care of
their salvation too.

145
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,709
You don't know these workers.

146
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,635
- They have the same worries
as us directors.

147
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,192
How many factories will
survive the crisis in Aalst?

148
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,876
If the government won't subsidize
me, I will close down.

149
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,402
There will be no subvention.

150
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,536
But you promised...

151
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:39,037
My colleagues in the government
don't want state intervention.

152
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,953
They recommend the English method.

153
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,954
Limit production costs to
enable competition.

154
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,476
Lower the wages?
That's impossible.

155
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,509
It's not, I pay them 1.60 franc
for 14 hours work.

156
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,114
- Cumont pays 2 franc for 11 hours.

157
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,238
- And he's still complaining,
he's going to go down.

158
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:06,396
If we all draw the line, they
even will accept 1.40 franc.

159
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,631
While a loaf of bread costs 60 centimes
and a bag of coal 1,50?

160
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,950
Pay them with potatoes.

161
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,032
Why not?
The money goes to booze anyway.

162
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,492
- They won't survive...

163
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,751
They also won't survive
if the factories close.

164
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,319
- Gentleman, please...

165
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,373
Poverty is not the problem.

166
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,957
I agree with that, Mr President.

167
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:34,254
Gentlemen, to me it's dangerous
to lower the wages now.

168
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,550
People are already upset.

169
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,836
We could implement the Scottish system.
Three workers to four machines.

170
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,915
And if we only let the women work
we save half.

171
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,550
You can't mean that?

172
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,629
- It's an interesting idea.
- The Scots still do it as well.

173
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:02,477
Three female worker to four machines.
12, 13 or 14 hours per night?

174
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,399
Are there not enough accidents
already?

175
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,165
How many fatal accidents
have you got?

176
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,261
And you, Antoine? And you all ?

177
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,793
Save us your demagogy.
In every war there will be casualties.

178
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,673
You are monsters. All of you!

179
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,756
We liberals stand up for our workers
who live in total poverty.

180
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,084
No aid from you, and
Aalst will lose its industry

181
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:35,863
and you -
your constituents.

182
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,197
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Woeste and you gentlemen...

183
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,954
...but now it's time
to relax.

184
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:53,319
- What a charming thought.
- Don't hide, Junior.

185
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,755
Say hello to Mr. Woeste.

186
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,715
Hello, Junior.

187
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:03,072
Work hard and you'll be a big executive
just like your dad.

188
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,757
Who is teaching you?

189
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:11,516
We are looking. They have recommend
Father Daens to us.

190
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,199
Father Daens?

191
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,193
The brother of that printer.
Let's hope he thinks differently.

192
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,439
It doesn't say a-e, but e, consul-e.

193
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:40,636
The root always stays the same.

194
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,112
Carry on.

195
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,834
Latin bores me, Father.

196
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,199
Don't recite it like a parrot,
without knowing what you say.

197
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,590
- What is written there?
- Consul.

198
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:57,433
- Do you know what that is.
- No.

199
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,592
Only women and children. Go away.

200
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,795
Let those children pass.

201
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,688
Out, Scholliers,
no work for you.

202
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,577
- Because you say so?

203
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,761
Too old. Try to work in Germany.

204
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,657
Let my dad in.

205
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,752
- What's your name?
- Nette.

206
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,477
Take his place at the spinner.

207
00:17:21,003 --> 00:17:22,403
I work in the laundry.

208
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,351
Nette, don't talk.

209
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,473
Here.
Don't work barefoot.

210
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:39,349
No work, Andre!
Scottish system, you're off.

211
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,512
I'm going to work.
Or do your machines work alone?

212
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,875
- You cost too much.
- Too much?

213
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,669
Must we pay to work here now,
according to your Scottish system?

214
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,631
I don't speak Flemish,
but I know what you write.

215
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,395
I received countless letters.
I quote:

216
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,039
"Every day children die
at the gates of the factories."

217
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,874
Mr Daens, if I didn't know better...

218
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,119
...I would think this is written
by a socialist.

219
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,910
But it's true, Mr Woeste.
Too many children die.

220
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:27,835
You only stir up commotion.
Don't forget your catholic subscribers.

221
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,230
As leader of the Catholic Party...

222
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,359
...I won't let you smear the
pillars of our society.

223
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,397
I assure you, Mr Woeste...

224
00:18:36,674 --> 00:18:38,674
Excuse me...

225
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,917
- May I introduce my brother Adolf to you?

226
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,085
- Adolf, this is our chairman.

227
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:47,456
- Pleasure.

228
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,996
You've arrived at the right moment.

229
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,870
I just warned your brother
about the context of his article.

230
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,676
As a priest why don't you try
to reason with him.

231
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,410
That would be difficult.

232
00:19:03,836 --> 00:19:05,256
And why so?

233
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:10,872
Because I wrote the article
myself.

234
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,113
Decent of you to protect him...

235
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,911
But your cassock makes me
disbelieve you.

236
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,391
I hope your conceptions
do right to your costume.

237
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,235
That goes without saying.

238
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,269
But some of your ideas don't
match your clothing.

239
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:42,834
If you want to keep your soutane,
don't start again.

240
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:51,875
You're crazy!
Talking to him like that...

241
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,823
What'll we do now?

242
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:58,293
We? You just carry on...
...with another article.

243
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,977
Come here. Take these two to the six and
from now on take the five as well.

244
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,379
Sort it out among you.

245
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:06,204
Go on!

246
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,556
Get to your machines!

247
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,036
To machines!

248
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,071
Hang your coat there.

249
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,552
Watch out.
Wait till the machine is stationery.

250
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:10,191
Tie up your hair.
It's dangerous like that.

251
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,638
- Keep your hands off me.
- Don't be afraid...

252
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,381
I'm not as bad as they say.

253
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,294
Leave me alone.

254
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,751
If he touches you once more,
I'll beat him up.

255
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:50,357
I'll smash his face.
I'll beat Borremans as well.

256
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,279
You don't believe me, do you?
You'll see...

257
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,480
Show Ponnet in!

258
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,358
Monseigneur.

259
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,256
Is what Daens writes true...

260
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,102
Or not?

261
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,471
Depends on the point of view
the facts are considered from.

262
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,277
- I'm a priest, a shepherd.
- That's not what I asked.

263
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,993
Nobody can deny that poverty
reigns in Aalst, Monseigneur,

264
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,358
just like in many other cities,
but we do our best to help.

265
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,270
Did... Daens ever show you
his sermons?

266
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,271
No. I'm not good enough!

267
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,159
Sometimes he doesn't even
bother to speak to me.

268
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,428
I try to behave like a Christian,

269
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,515
but my feelings do not
really matter here.

270
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,069
You can have it for a week.

271
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,710
You can kiss it at your leisure.

272
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,901
Put on your hat...

273
00:23:07,127 --> 00:23:08,800
easily someone could hit you.

274
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,438
So, Catalina comes in
and you speak to him directly

275
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,199
and remember:

276
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,716
you only have one hour
to save your life.

277
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,117
Borremans, come out,
I'll hit you!

278
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,886
Come out, if you dare!

279
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:55,954
Get him, Titus!

280
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,198
Don't!

281
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,656
Stop that dog!

282
00:24:03,382 --> 00:24:05,154
Titus!... Heel!

283
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,511
- Leave me alone.
- I want to help you.

284
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,875
Priests are for the rich.

285
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,428
Father, what is going on?

286
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,478
Father, come... your wounds
need treating.

287
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,639
No need to clean up St. Ursula.

288
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,075
No celebration for her this year.

289
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,391
And neither for us. No mass.
No party.

290
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:27,757
Leave them alone, dad.
Come on, go home, dad.

291
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,953
But father, you are hurt!

292
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,389
- You scare people.
- Guess so.

293
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,790
But this needs to be tended to.

294
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,919
- What's your name?
- Nette, Nette Scholliers.

295
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,071
Come.

296
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,311
- We have nothing as it is.
- Mama , this is Father...

297
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,879
...Daens.

298
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,192
Good morning, Madame, Monsieur.
Sorry to bother you.

299
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,952
I bumped into something.

300
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,829
Sit down, Father. Nette...
Take a clean towel.

301
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,434
Welcome, Father.

302
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,108
Kids, look here!

303
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,034
A real priest in the house.

304
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,279
Frans! Forgive him, Father.
He was fired at the factory.

305
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,853
- Louis... Wannes

306
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:30,743
No need to wake them.

307
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,234
If they don't see you
they won't believe you were here.

308
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,037
Come on, Wannes, open your eyes!
Open your eyes Louis!

309
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:47,118
Doesn't matter. They have to go
to work anyway. On the night shift.

310
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,732
They never go to school?

311
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,625
The two youngest do, sometimes.

312
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:52,874
The others work at the plant.

313
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,759
Good workers. All of them. And our Louis...

314
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,094
Louis...

315
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,414
He's a porter at the town hall.

316
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,835
Close your eyes, Father.

317
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,112
Louis, get up, the priest is here.

318
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,372
Let him be, he's drunk.

319
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:09,551
- Nette!

320
00:27:10,177 --> 00:27:11,311
Louis is a Buck.

321
00:27:11,537 --> 00:27:13,658
At night they beat up the reds.

322
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,289
Shut up. The Bucks are bastards.

323
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:20,289
What is going on here?
Someone needs a beating?

324
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,730
If you want to, do like the priest
and beat up your friend Schmitt.

325
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,667
He can't keep his
claws to himself.

326
00:27:26,993 --> 00:27:29,804
Nette, don't discuss this now.

327
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,108
- But ma!

328
00:27:31,634 --> 00:27:32,481
Schmitt is boss.

329
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:34,378
That doesn't mean
he can touch me!

330
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,919
No more of this.

331
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,958
- Schmitt is not the only one, eh?
- Louis!

332
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,588
Say that again if you dare.

333
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,076
Let's pray first.

334
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:04,557
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

335
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,796
Lord bless us and this meal.

336
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,909
In the name of the Father and the
Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

337
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,274
A potato, Father?

338
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,482
Or a cup of coffee?

339
00:28:20,508 --> 00:28:22,263
Thanks.

340
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,928
Nora is a good cook. Enjoy yourself.

341
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,991
Now that you're here, Father,
may I ask you something?

342
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,677
What would you do?

343
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,611
For 30 years you work for a director
through thick and thin.

344
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,270
- Frans...
- Shut up!

345
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:55,075
All these years, you walk in his beautiful procession,
his procession for St. Ursula.

346
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,430
And then, suddenly, he says:
"Get out!"

347
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,277
What would you do, Father?

348
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:06,594
You'd still go to his procession?

349
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,476
Not me...

350
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,598
No, Father, not me.

351
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:19,429
Provided his sermon is decent
and deals with higher ideas,

352
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,230
nothing actually opposes a priest
to share with a large audience.

353
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:28,234
But Father Daens' sermon
is of shocking triviality

354
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,598
and I regret to say, is revealing
a shameful demagogy.

355
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,116
Quite right, Mr Woeste,
quite right.

356
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:43,518
But after all, this subject is only
inspired on Rerum Novarum...

357
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:48,507
and on paternal preoccupations
of his holiness Leon XIII

358
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:51,737
for the
condition of the workers.

359
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,874
This encyclical doesn't mention the stirring of
the workers against those who feed them!

360
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:00,316
Now, Daens has created such suspicion

361
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,634
that the government considers to
send an investigation committee to Aalst.

362
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:10,877
- What a triumph for our enemies!
- On the contrary, Mr Woeste.

363
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,318
If, as you say,
we are talking about slander,

364
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,155
an inquest will prove
that Father Daens is wrong.

365
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,677
A word from you would suffice,
to reduce him to silence.

366
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:30,510
Father Daens is careless,
Mr Woeste,

367
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,108
but... he has a brilliant mind,

368
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,558
and in that case, I'm not sure
that a reprimand is enough.

369
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:45,033
Monseigneur, you have other means than a
mere reprimand to ensure his obedience.

370
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,633
When a priest uses his cloth to spread
hostilities, it can be taken away.

371
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,990
Mr Woeste, I'm afraid that only the ecclesiastic
authorities are capable to judge this.

372
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,474
Of course, Monseigneur.

373
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,236
But you must understand me.
I came in everybody's interest

374
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,518
to avoid this matter from going
beyond this diocese

375
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:20,970
and leading us to appeal
to higher instances.

376
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:26,759
An energetic cure at the right moment
can prevent complications.

377
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,358
Don't you agree?

378
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:36,195
I understand you perfectly
my son.

379
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,398
An investigation committee
in the factories of Aalst!

380
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,711
An investigation committee
in the factories of Aalst!

381
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:56,000
Read "The Worker"!
Read Father Daens' new article.

382
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,351
Read "The Worker"!
The paper of good Catholics!

383
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,910
Read "Forwards!"
The real paper for the worker!

384
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,670
Large demonstration in Ghent
for general voting rights!

385
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,436
Read "Forwards!"
the socialist newspaper.

386
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,270
You there. Yes you miss!

387
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,911
He wants you.

388
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,432
You must buy this.
I wrote something for you.

389
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,717
I will read it to you...
...in your ear.

390
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,110
Leave it. It's some fool from Ghent.

391
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,352
You Reds can't read.

392
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,230
Your paper smells of hell.
Give me a clean catholic paper.

393
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,873
Hey, Fonske! - Read "Forwards"!
The real newspaper for the workers!

394
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,599
Here. Read this to me,
I can't read.

395
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,152
Me neither...

396
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,020
Read "The Worker"!

397
00:32:51,946 --> 00:32:55,220
You there, big mouth. What is written here?
Can you tell?

398
00:32:55,560 --> 00:33:00,209
- I can't read this catholic jargon.
- I told you he couldn't read.

399
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,877
Give that paper to me.

400
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,035
Ladies, great news.

401
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,234
"Thanks to Doctor Dupont
and his magical salts,

402
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,309
constipation is a thing
of the past!"

403
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,797
- That's not what it says.
- No? Who can read? You or me?

404
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,997
- Then read us Daens' article!
- Here is your article:

405
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,152
"Common sense has prevailed.

406
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:35,235
The government has
decided that a committee

407
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:39,678
of 6 honourable personalities

408
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:45,358
will investigate
the factories of Aalst.

409
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,356
They will be able to interrogate
the workers directly..."

410
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:57,592
Surely, you don't believe what the
priest says, that they'll listen.

411
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,752
They're all the director's friends.

412
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,876
If you want respect from them,

413
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,079
you must change the government.
Hence, the parliament first.

414
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,314
But since we don't have a say in parliament,
we need voting rights first!

415
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,233
Who are you to criticize Daens?

416
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,789
There is no one like him in Ghent.

417
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:20,758
Your priest says the same we do.
But we said it first.

418
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,070
So loud that we didn't hear it!

419
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:27,239
Besides, Daens is in our paper and
not in yours, you red cabbage!

420
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,437
This committee only comes to eat.

421
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,354
- Not potatoes, but fat steaks.
- What are you talking about?

422
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,479
That Daens is a saint.
He will change the factories.

423
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,955
Priests are sly and change nothing.

424
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,237
You don't know what a committee is.

425
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:47,756
We, socialists,
demanded 2 francs for 12 hours.

426
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,879
So what?
Daens asked 12 francs for 2 hours.

427
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,237
You wise ass!

428
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,313
The riddle has been solved
by a great catholic,

429
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,314
Put all your children to work.
They'll never get ill.

430
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,031
Here my friend, sell mine too.
You'll be more successful.

431
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:14,518
So no more schools to raise.
Weavers...

432
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,518
Sold out already?

433
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,750
- Do I get anything?
- For what you want from Nette,

434
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,639
you'll have to do more than read.

435
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,271
Buy us a drink and we'll forget
you are a socialist.

436
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,953
The Bucks!

437
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,916
And our Louis!

438
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,549
There! Let's get him, fellows.

439
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,960
- Red dog, damn it!
- Shit ass!

440
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,954
Brussels? This is Aalst.

441
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,509
May I speak to Mr Woeste?

442
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,397
Damn...

443
00:36:03,623 --> 00:36:04,902
Doesn't work?

444
00:36:05,927 --> 00:36:07,327
Thank you.

445
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,068
Eugene, I've never interfered,

446
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,232
but this concerns my family.
Please, I beg you.

447
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,995
For Junior's sake.

448
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,589
To reconsider the whole thing.

449
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:29,435
Mr Daens has always been welcome,

450
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,515
but he has gone too far! Christ, he demands
that my factory be investigated.

451
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,319
You must separate matters.

452
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,289
- Tell Daens!
- No, I'm telling you.

453
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,725
This is about our son.

454
00:36:41,151 --> 00:36:44,221
My son will not be
educated by a socialist!

455
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,396
Not a word about it!

456
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,237
Shut your mouths!

457
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,156
Take off those rags!

458
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,279
- Off!
- They're all I have.

459
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,590
Then go home!

460
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,753
And no stupidities, you hear?
You know what to say!

461
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,835
- And us?
- You will not speak!

462
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,176
These are serious people from
parliament. At your machines!

463
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,951
At your machines!

464
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,848
Marie, ask Julia to
swap places with me.

465
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:12,157
Julia... Do you want to swap
with Nette?

466
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,182
Nette...

467
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,171
- Schmitt!...

468
00:38:34,297 --> 00:38:37,377
An excellent foreman,
knows the factory very well.

469
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,749
Ask him any question you like.

470
00:38:42,375 --> 00:38:43,134
Attention...

471
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,075
Aren't these machines dangerous?

472
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,553
No, sir. The director has had
new modern machines installed.

473
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,678
It's only dangerous when you drink.

474
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,032
I feel that I am going to find
me a spot here!

475
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,671
- Do you like to work at night?
- What about your husband? Any kids?

476
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,798
- She only speaks Flemish.
- What does she say??

477
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,394
She's happy.
She says she's very happy here.

478
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:20,190
She wants to work nights,
so she stays with her kid in the day.

479
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,679
Excuse me. Any toilets here?

480
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:18,593
- I'd like to go to the bathroom.
- No, no, it's ladies only.

481
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,747
What about the men?
- This way.

482
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:23,756
Is it far?
- No, at the director's.

483
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,770
Sir, do you speak Flemish?
They locked the children in there!

484
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,315
What is it, my child?

485
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,033
They're lying!

486
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,319
Go on! Tell him!

487
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,190
We're treated like animals.

488
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,271
We...

489
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:52,709
Every day there are accidents
because we are too tired.

490
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,318
What is she saying?

491
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,596
Excuse me sir, we're running late.

492
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,297
- Problems Schmitt?
- No, sir.

493
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,575
Scholliers!

494
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,550
Satisfied?

495
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,235
Two francs fine.

496
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,798
Stupid cows.
Why didn't you say something?

497
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:49,272
- It was our only chance.
- We tried, but they didn't understand.

498
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:54,838
You were wiggling with your hips.
We should have pulled together.

499
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,376
There won't be another committee.

500
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:01,512
We will die like rats!

501
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:05,756
Come on, Milleke, get on!

502
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,873
This isn't your bed, come on.

503
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,998
Get to work!

504
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,752
At your machines!

505
00:42:16,178 --> 00:42:17,502
Faster, come on!

506
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,271
Milleke!

507
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:29,155
Damn it, watch where you going.

508
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:41,995
- Mother, is dad coming home tonight?
- Yes, honey, he'll be right there,

509
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,392
but be quiet now...

510
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,269
- I'm so hungry, mother.
- I know, son,

511
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,675
but... Listen!

512
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:51,502
Josee!

513
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:54,229
There's daddy.

514
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,269
- Josee... Where's my dinner?
- You smell of booze again!

515
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:10,991
- Drink is our downfall!
- Give me food, I tell you,

516
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,719
- or I'll go back to the pub!
- A piece of bread is all

517
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:20,351
we have left.
It's for Fonske.

518
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:26,434
Give it here!
And speaking about Fonske...

519
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:29,876
I'll go and ask at the factory
when he can start!

520
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,917
No!

521
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,672
He's old enough!

522
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,756
- But Jules! He is only six!
- I was only five!

523
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,600
Milleke!

524
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,520
Move!

525
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,650
He is dead!

526
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:55,595
Clarisse, Julia, take him away.
I will get water.

527
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,435
Nette, don't. - Get off!

528
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:12,200
Come on, Nette.

529
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:18,513
This is understandable not only
in Flemish.

530
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:27,750
Everybody, to your machines!

531
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,434
- Wait a minute.
- Let me through.

532
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:54,031
Josee.

533
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,470
We are rich!

534
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,275
Jules, did the director give you a raise?

535
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,398
Yeah, as from today, I am working
one floor higher up!

536
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:11,552
But you're home so early!
Yes, I really hurried.

537
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,115
By the way... where is our Fonske?

538
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,317
He's gone to rehearse at the choir.

539
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,755
Good. I like that.

540
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,916
"Even without knowing the result,

541
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,629
the coming of the committee
is an important step forward".

542
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,112
"The Committee"? The Committee!

543
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,736
Pieter!       Father!

544
00:48:06,161 --> 00:48:07,499
Borremans is closed.

545
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,439
Something must have happened.

546
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,391
Gendarmes!

547
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,116
Draw your sabres!

548
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,717
Officer!

549
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,111
What do you want?

550
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,313
We want to see the committee.

551
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,949
Gentlemen, please come this way.

552
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,832
You can come along if you like.

553
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,715
- They have a dead child, commander.
- Take it from them. - But...

554
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,413
- Do it!
- Yes, commander.

555
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,836
- Charge!
- Oh, no!

556
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,189
Where is Milleke?

557
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,915
It's coming from Mijlenbeeck!

558
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,235
Hey, no! Stop!

559
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:03,799
Look what you've done.

560
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,828
Fool! Look what you've done.

561
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:12,160
Get out of here! Get out!

562
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,431
Get lost!

563
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:35,391
I suggested to Stillemans that you
give a sermon on Rerum Novarum,

564
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,790
but he insisted that I do it.

565
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:45,277
- Have you read my sermon?
- Yes.

566
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:49,076
- What do you think?
- Very bad.

567
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,250
The St. Matthew's gospel we just heard

568
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:46,290
is telling us about the miraculous multiplication
of the bread and fish.

569
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:52,083
Lots of them, hundreds, thousands
of men, women and children, rich and poor,

570
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,828
had followed Christ
and had been listening to Him.

571
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,073
When the evening came, the apostles

572
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:05,509
asked him to send the crowd home,
or to the surrounded villages

573
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,449
to find food and shelter.

574
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:11,884
And he said "Why don't you feed them?"

575
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:15,939
They told him there was barely
enough for themselves,

576
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:19,453
5 loaves of bread and 2 fishes.

577
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,553
He looked reproachfully at them,

578
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,439
asked the people to sit,
looked towards heaven,

579
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:30,628
blessed the loaves of
bread and the fish

580
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:35,635
and had his disciples share them.

581
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,396
There were 5 000 people.
They all ate.

582
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,997
They all had their fill.

583
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:49,396
Beloved parishioners,

584
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,551
if Christ teaches us
that it is our duty

585
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:59,669
to share without prejudice
of rank or class,

586
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:05,790
if he gives away the little food he
has to complete strangers,

587
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:11,271
then why shouldn't this be the duty
of the Belgian bourgeois class

588
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:16,355
toward the poor, who they know?
Who work for them!

589
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:22,998
Or do these people, who claim to be
faithful servants of the pope,

590
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:27,113
think that the gospel
is not meant for French ears,

591
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:34,118
because it is written in Latin? People scream:
"We're hungry!" Loud and clear.

592
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,913
And these words should not
be thrown to the wind.

593
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,678
It is time the voices of the
poor were heard in this country.

594
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,118
Besides, my dear friends, how come,

595
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,598
that the voice of the rich is always
much louder than a poor man's?

596
00:57:53,840 --> 00:58:00,154
Why is a poor man's vote
worth less than a rich man's?

597
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,237
Who has a right to say: "You
are good and you are bad,

598
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,497
you can vote, and you cannot?"

599
00:58:07,980 --> 00:58:11,092
Unbelievable!
He preaches universal suffrage!

600
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:21,949
Gentlemen, directors. What does the pope,
whom you like to quote so much,

601
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:26,910
what does he say
in his encyclical Rerum Novarum?

602
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,711
"We are convinced
that we should improve

603
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:34,314
the fate of the lower class
because a large part of them

604
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:39,315
live in undeserved misery."

605
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,350
My dear friends, it is clear that

606
00:58:56,520 --> 00:59:01,640
our Holy Father, Pope Leo XIII, and Christ
are speaking the same language

607
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:09,716
and that an end should be put
to this organised, established injustice.

608
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,758
And remember, my friends:
you don't have anything.

609
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:19,198
It is not you who have to share,
but those,

610
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:23,876
who have just left this church.

611
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:38,029
How can you be so clumsy?

612
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,510
Thanks to your brutality,
Daens has all the trumps.

613
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,639
Be more clever with you workers.
Give them soup,

614
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:49,634
knit them scarves...
That will make us popular.

615
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:54,078
The pope wants more charity.
That's the right policy!

616
00:59:55,120 --> 01:00:00,274
I'm not sure that's enough.
The situation is too serious.

617
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:05,151
- They demand the universal suffrage.
- They'll never have it!

618
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:11,312
I'm sorry, but...
a lot of people think otherwise.

619
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:14,273
Half of the factories are striking

620
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:17,000
for the universal suffrage.
The agitation is such

621
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:23,030
that it would be a miracle if Aalst
escapes this revolution.

622
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:30,358
Mr Woeste, the strikers find support
everywhere, even within our own party.

623
01:00:31,880 --> 01:00:36,590
Father Daens runs a campaign
for the universal suffrage,

624
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:40,469
within our party.
- Throw him out.

625
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,950
- Him, his brother and the others.
- No, that's not enough.

626
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:46,918
That would turn him into a martyr.

627
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,907
There's only one
way to finish him.

628
01:00:50,433 --> 01:00:51,799
Unfrock him!

629
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:57,476
In civil clothes
this priest will be a nobody.

630
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,796
I'll go all the way to the Vatican.

631
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:09,113
- Not in that thing, you won't!
- Very funny...

632
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:15,633
We must be aware that many workers
will turn their back on the Church.

633
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:20,078
More so the reason not to hesitate
and to be firm to Daens.

634
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,598
I'd love to, but I won't be degraded
to Mr Woeste's errand boy.

635
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,117
Send Daens to the Congo.
They're short of missionaries.

636
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,999
Then Daens will stand with the blacks

637
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:36,550
and they'll all return with him.
I know Daens.

638
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,277
Hurry up Willem,
I have work to do.

639
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:50,433
Sorry Monseigneur, the only solution
here might be a prayer.

640
01:01:56,340 --> 01:02:00,733
Arise, ye wretched of the earth...

641
01:02:03,958 --> 01:02:08,558
UNIVERSAL RIGHT TO VOTE

642
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:27,230
Monseigneur...

643
01:02:27,356 --> 01:02:31,080
This is the result
of your reckless talk!

644
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:36,396
Father Daens!

645
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:40,712
You are a priest
to spread God's word,

646
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:43,872
not the socialists'.

647
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,756
If there is inequality on earth,
it is because God wants it.

648
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,915
I wouldn't say that.
You reason like Woeste.

649
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:56,466
He turns God into a Belgian

650
01:02:56,492 --> 01:02:58,862
who bars everyone who isn't a Belg

651
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,504
from entering his heaven.

652
01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:04,460
Quiet... Daens!

653
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,917
I haven't asked you here
to discuss politics.

654
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:21,075
Once more, you embarrass me
with your difficult character.

655
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:27,316
Instead of visiting pubs in your robe,

656
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:32,156
don't you think you should look at
yourself and try to find out

657
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,471
whether all this popularity

658
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:41,431
doesn't stem from the pursuit
of pure vanity?

659
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:44,077
You don't listen to anybody,

660
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:48,193
because you want them
to listen to you!

661
01:03:49,218 --> 01:03:51,218
Professor!

662
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,595
That is not the issue.

663
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,356
The seriousness of the situation
in Aalst escapes you.

664
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:04,240
You and I are facing hard times.

665
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,837
Flanders is lost if Aalst becomes red.

666
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:17,109
That's what catholic workers think.

667
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:22,516
You are stumbling over your own brains.

668
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:28,749
To give you a chance
to do penance for this,

669
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:33,278
you will temporarily celebrate
the mass in solitude.

670
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:38,834
I forbid you to preach
in Sint-Martinus church again!

671
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,720
Don't do that, Monseigneur!

672
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:47,073
- Monseigneur, I beg you...
- Kneel,

673
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:51,273
so that I can bless you.

674
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:52,425
More...

675
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:55,715
No, or there'll be nothing left
for the little ones.

676
01:04:55,958 --> 01:04:57,900
Let them work, if
they want to eat.

677
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:58,868
I'm on strike.

678
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:00,204
- Slacker! Ask Louis.

679
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,116
- Louis is a rat.
- Don't speak about him like that.

680
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:08,876
- You don't work either.
- Don't talk to father like that.

681
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,509
- You shut up, you're on strike!

682
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:14,956
Give it back, you can't do that!
It's for Jannes.

683
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,429
Give that potato back!

684
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:18,205
Enough!

685
01:05:19,131 --> 01:05:20,236
- If that's how it is,

686
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,598
there's free soup at the factory.

687
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:23,956
- Sit down.

688
01:05:24,482 --> 01:05:29,461
We eat only what we've earned.
That soup is for the poor.

689
01:05:29,620 --> 01:05:31,515
We are poor, Dad!

690
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:38,949
- Worker or striker?
- I don't work.

691
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:40,867
- Go away.
- I work.

692
01:05:46,955 --> 01:05:51,392
- Why don't they get anything?
- You only get soup if you work.

693
01:05:52,355 --> 01:05:55,586
Do you think I'm crazy?
Do you think we feed the reds?

694
01:05:55,755 --> 01:06:01,546
That soup is poison!
Belgium strikes! We must join them!

695
01:06:02,355 --> 01:06:05,153
Do you want them to laugh at us?
That soup is to break the strike!

696
01:06:05,315 --> 01:06:09,024
We, the socialist, are giving
soup to everybody.

697
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:12,392
Real good Aalst onion soup for everyone!

698
01:06:12,975 --> 01:06:19,607
Don't believe them. Who wants some?
Don't eat it. It's pagan soup.

699
01:06:19,935 --> 01:06:20,794
Don't believe them.

700
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:25,458
Let's all strike! Strike
for the universal suffrage!

701
01:06:25,955 --> 01:06:29,504
I think he's right.
We must carry on the strike.

702
01:06:29,675 --> 01:06:32,189
They'll think you're red too!

703
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:34,949
I don't care, I'm hungry.

704
01:06:35,675 --> 01:06:37,347
Who else?

705
01:06:37,555 --> 01:06:39,910
I'm sure Daens supports the strike.

706
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:42,270
- He should say so.
- But he's gone.

707
01:06:42,435 --> 01:06:45,871
You'll never see him again, believe me.

708
01:06:49,195 --> 01:06:52,153
Where is Daens, Father?

709
01:06:52,315 --> 01:06:56,228
A priest is like a soldier.
He goes where God needs him.

710
01:06:56,395 --> 01:06:59,785
I want to know where Daens is.
You're hiding him.

711
01:07:00,035 --> 01:07:03,584
- Ridiculous.
- Then were is Daens?

712
01:07:03,755 --> 01:07:07,668
Now, now, friends...
Leave the Father alone.

713
01:07:08,115 --> 01:07:11,266
I want to know where Daens is!

714
01:07:11,595 --> 01:07:14,632
- Where is Daens!
- Schmitt, no more soup.

715
01:07:20,555 --> 01:07:22,794
No soup for strikers!

716
01:07:23,355 --> 01:07:26,904
 Have you gone mad?
Leave that kid alone, you idiot!

717
01:07:31,155 --> 01:07:33,191
- Where's the soup?
- But, Elizabeth.

718
01:07:33,355 --> 01:07:36,984
Wasn't that soup for everyone?

719
01:07:37,635 --> 01:07:41,674
Long live the strike!
And the universal suffrage!

720
01:08:04,515 --> 01:08:06,790
Not enough salt.

721
01:08:10,555 --> 01:08:13,945
One million more votes...
That's preposterous!

722
01:08:14,115 --> 01:08:16,390
You insult the people!

723
01:08:18,115 --> 01:08:21,710
Gentlemen! A little dignity, please!

724
01:08:22,635 --> 01:08:24,705
The vote is closed.

725
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:28,470
I'll read to you the result of the vote

726
01:08:28,635 --> 01:08:33,584
on the law proposal from Mr Nyssens,

727
01:08:34,195 --> 01:08:38,234
on the introduction in Belgium
of plural suffrage.

728
01:08:38,715 --> 01:08:42,105
Have voted in favour: 119

729
01:08:46,795 --> 01:08:49,707
Have voted against: 14

730
01:08:50,355 --> 01:08:52,266
Abstentions: 12

731
01:08:52,435 --> 01:08:54,869
The proposal has been accepted!

732
01:10:04,755 --> 01:10:08,111
- Adolf... Something wrong?

733
01:10:09,275 --> 01:10:11,914
I'm looking for a nice "C".

734
01:10:13,355 --> 01:10:17,473
"Christian People's Party".
"Program".

735
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:29,548
Here, before you're covered with ink!

736
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:32,630
How many will we print?

737
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,104
- Thirty thousand?
- To start with.

738
01:10:35,275 --> 01:10:39,085
And one for Woeste. In gold.

739
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:41,990
We'll be the biggest party in Aalst!

740
01:10:42,595 --> 01:10:44,990
VOTE FOR FATHER DAENS

741
01:10:47,595 --> 01:10:49,870
There's room on Woeste!

742
01:10:50,035 --> 01:10:54,074
You fought for the highest right
of man on this earth.

743
01:10:54,235 --> 01:10:59,184
The right to speak freely.
And you won!

744
01:11:00,035 --> 01:11:05,632
From now on, you too will decide
what your and your kids future will look like.

745
01:11:06,035 --> 01:11:07,946
The socialists!

746
01:11:23,995 --> 01:11:28,193
Go on, Father! It's good folk
that come to listen.

747
01:11:30,675 --> 01:11:34,224
Friends... I know your children
are starving,

748
01:11:34,515 --> 01:11:38,030
that you hardly ever eat meat,

749
01:11:38,195 --> 01:11:41,267
that they pay you with wet coals.

750
01:11:41,435 --> 01:11:45,428
But does that surprise us?
No, because for years

751
01:11:45,795 --> 01:11:50,710
the catholic party has
oppressed the workers

752
01:11:50,915 --> 01:11:54,544
and pushed them into misery,

753
01:11:54,715 --> 01:11:57,707
deaf to their cries of despair.

754
01:11:57,875 --> 01:12:03,233
Comrades, shall we once and
for all throw off the catholic yoke and finally

755
01:12:03,395 --> 01:12:07,273
- have our own say?
- Yes!

756
01:12:08,555 --> 01:12:16,206
Comrades! For that, unfortunately,
we are not yet strong enough.

757
01:12:17,235 --> 01:12:23,105
Friends! We, the liberals,
are not strong enough either!

758
01:12:23,275 --> 01:12:27,712
Therefore, we propose
to join us and vote for Father Daens!

759
01:12:27,875 --> 01:12:30,184
Against the Catholics.

760
01:12:31,035 --> 01:12:33,595
Long live Father Daens!

761
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:39,144
And the socialists!

762
01:12:39,635 --> 01:12:41,865
And the liberals!

763
01:12:42,795 --> 01:12:46,868
Friends! From now on
you won't have to fear...

764
01:12:48,875 --> 01:12:53,266
You won't have to fear
that your voice won't be heard.

765
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:58,904
If injustice is guaranteed by the law,

766
01:12:59,115 --> 01:13:01,948
then the people must rise
and with a swift kick

767
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:08,073
get rid of all this crap and injustice!

768
01:13:09,155 --> 01:13:12,670
It's every workman's duty

769
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:16,350
to support each other in the
struggle for a decent life.

770
01:13:31,275 --> 01:13:35,029
Sorry for this building site,
Mr Woeste, but

771
01:13:35,195 --> 01:13:41,065
a king must continually built
his kingdom, mustn't he?

772
01:13:42,195 --> 01:13:45,710
- I hope your family is well?
- Very well, Your Majesty.

773
01:13:46,715 --> 01:13:50,947
It seems the universal suffrage
was inevitable.

774
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:56,790
So be it. What do you propose as a remedy?

775
01:13:57,315 --> 01:14:02,912
A stronger catholic unity, sire,
and more firmness from the priests.

776
01:14:03,075 --> 01:14:07,466
Eventually, the red demagogy
might endanger your throne.

777
01:14:07,715 --> 01:14:12,106
To fight their influence,
we have the church,

778
01:14:12,275 --> 01:14:16,109
but it doesn't support us enough.

779
01:14:16,275 --> 01:14:18,770
- Cardinal Goossens has arrived.
- Let him in.

780
01:14:19,395 --> 01:14:27,143
What a coincidence... We talk about Church's
problems and Goossens asks for an audience.

781
01:14:27,495 --> 01:14:29,983
Should we see him?

782
01:14:30,155 --> 01:14:33,431
- It's up to you, Your Majesty.
- Very well.

783
01:14:33,755 --> 01:14:36,223
Come in, Monseigneur!

784
01:14:38,755 --> 01:14:45,433
We were just discussing, Mr Woeste
and me, a subject that concerns you.

785
01:14:45,595 --> 01:14:48,871
Father Daens, I suppose?

786
01:14:49,035 --> 01:14:55,383
I understand that Mr Woeste feels very
strongly about this priest becoming elected.

787
01:14:55,555 --> 01:14:59,514
I take the opportunity to answer him

788
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:03,111
that nothing in the canon law permits us

789
01:15:03,275 --> 01:15:06,824
to forbid a priest to run for election.

790
01:15:06,995 --> 01:15:14,234
Of course, but, as I recall, a priest must obey
his bishop if he forbids public activities.

791
01:15:15,035 --> 01:15:21,048
That may be, but it's up to the bishop,
and only him!

792
01:15:21,515 --> 01:15:25,474
Come now, Mr Woeste, could a little priest
present such a danger?

793
01:15:25,635 --> 01:15:31,385
No, Sire. I will solve
this problem somehow.

794
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:35,298
Great!
Great!

795
01:15:39,195 --> 01:15:42,228
One, two, three, four, five...

796
01:15:42,354 --> 01:15:45,336
You must count five letters.
Not six!

797
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:46,216
- Five, yes!

798
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:50,204
Otherwise, you vote for Woeste!
Or do you vote for the directors?

799
01:15:51,435 --> 01:15:56,145
So count five letters - as many as
the fingers of one hand.

800
01:15:57,595 --> 01:15:59,392
- Six!

801
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:04,929
Mr Woeste himself
honours you with his presence.

802
01:16:05,315 --> 01:16:09,588
A warm applause for him
and his great sausages!

803
01:16:11,855 --> 01:16:13,040
Good evening!

804
01:16:13,266 --> 01:16:16,932
Long live Woeste, our
voice in parliament.

805
01:16:17,175 --> 01:16:20,850
Who wants this gorgeous sausage?
With a nice glass of beer?

806
01:16:21,115 --> 01:16:24,187
Drinks are on us!

807
01:16:24,635 --> 01:16:28,264
They're good sausages!
Thank you, Mr Woeste!

808
01:16:28,635 --> 01:16:34,264
- Can I have a sausage?
- Sausage? - "Saucisse"...

809
01:16:34,315 --> 01:16:37,864
Of course! Give him one.

810
01:16:39,115 --> 01:16:42,073
- I can't vote anyway.
- Yes, very well.

811
01:16:42,915 --> 01:16:47,989
"On the 5th of September, in 1862,

812
01:16:48,315 --> 01:16:53,184
they climbed in Wolverhampton
in their balloon

813
01:16:53,355 --> 01:16:59,385
to a height of 8 838 meters,
where they measured..."

814
01:17:57,715 --> 01:18:01,151
Today is election day
for the Belgian parliament.

815
01:18:01,315 --> 01:18:07,094
All Belgians older than 25
must vote. Don't forget!

816
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:19,474
Voting for Daens is a mortal sin.
You'll go to hell if you do.

817
01:18:19,955 --> 01:18:22,423
The catholic party protects faith.

818
01:18:22,595 --> 01:18:26,304
So remember to vote for Mr Woeste.
God bless you.

819
01:18:41,915 --> 01:18:44,588
Voting for Daens is against God.

820
01:18:44,755 --> 01:18:49,067
It leads you straight to the devil. Scholliers...
Voting for Daens is a mortal sin.

821
01:18:49,435 --> 01:18:52,711
The catholic party protects our faith.

822
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:56,534
So remember, it's Mr Woeste

823
01:18:56,575 --> 01:18:58,666
who deserves your vote. Bless you,

824
01:19:01,115 --> 01:19:04,710
- my child.
- Who's that?

825
01:19:06,355 --> 01:19:10,633
Don't believe what he says.
Are you voting for the rich?

826
01:19:10,795 --> 01:19:15,311
Are you deaf? Voting for
Daens is a mortal sin.

827
01:19:15,515 --> 01:19:19,428
They say he's not a real priest.
They say he has a wife.

828
01:19:19,595 --> 01:19:22,109
Who says so? Louis?

829
01:19:22,275 --> 01:19:25,711
They're all lies.
Don't you believe that slander.

830
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:29,629
Vote for Daens.
Otherwise, nothing will change.

831
01:19:34,755 --> 01:19:40,273
- Here's my salary.
- How many letters in Daens?

832
01:19:48,035 --> 01:19:49,832
Six!

833
01:19:57,355 --> 01:19:59,615
Five letters, Dad, five!

834
01:20:00,940 --> 01:20:02,840
Daens

835
01:20:05,265 --> 01:20:06,965
Daens

836
01:20:10,390 --> 01:20:12,190
Daens

837
01:20:14,015 --> 01:20:15,715
Woeste

838
01:20:40,815 --> 01:20:42,685
Invalid.

839
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:53,186
Invalid.

840
01:21:00,911 --> 01:21:02,011
Invalid.

841
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:55,191
Yes?

842
01:21:58,715 --> 01:22:02,105
Just as we thought, Adolf!
We checked everything.

843
01:22:02,275 --> 01:22:05,426
There are hundreds of forms too many.

844
01:22:06,715 --> 01:22:10,549
That bastard Woeste let
all the dead of Aalst vote.

845
01:22:18,275 --> 01:22:22,473
For now we were able to reject the Daens
brothers' objections

846
01:22:22,675 --> 01:22:26,145
concerning your campaign,
Mr Woeste.

847
01:22:26,315 --> 01:22:30,410
The charges of corruption
or violence were removed.

848
01:22:30,615 --> 01:22:35,648
But we can't ignore the figures.
They can't be published.

849
01:22:35,695 --> 01:22:39,608
There were far too many
ballots in the  boxes.

850
01:22:39,675 --> 01:22:45,784
Because of this blunder, we'll
have to start the vote all over again.

851
01:22:46,235 --> 01:22:49,750
Believe me Mr Woeste,
we don't have a choice...

852
01:23:10,715 --> 01:23:13,548
Daens... has been elected!

853
01:23:14,995 --> 01:23:18,226
- Daens... has been elected!
- What!

854
01:23:18,251 --> 01:23:20,251
- Daens has been elected!

855
01:23:22,195 --> 01:23:24,663
Daens... has been elected!

856
01:23:37,995 --> 01:23:40,270
Daens... has been elected!

857
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:30,150
Anna, give them to mama. Thank you.

858
01:24:35,915 --> 01:24:40,067
Now go and tell them in
parliament that we are brave people.

859
01:24:40,275 --> 01:24:42,473
Yes, and tell
them we're hungry!

860
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:46,689
Tell them they should not forget
who they're dealing with!

861
01:24:46,755 --> 01:24:48,746
Long live Daens!

862
01:24:50,271 --> 01:24:55,671
Long live Daens!
Long live Daens!

863
01:25:19,595 --> 01:25:24,749
So, Father, you finally found a parish.

864
01:25:24,915 --> 01:25:30,114
My dear friend, it's a pleasure
to have you as my parishioner.

865
01:25:33,395 --> 01:25:37,673
Father Daens, the delegate
of Aalst will now speak.

866
01:25:37,835 --> 01:25:39,951
Well, let's hear him...

867
01:25:40,155 --> 01:25:42,385
I'll speak in French, because

868
01:25:42,555 --> 01:25:47,629
I understand Mr Woeste is
not yet advanced enough

869
01:25:47,835 --> 01:25:51,532
in the Flemish language to understand my statement.

870
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:57,866
Mr Woeste is accusing me
of lying concerning the poor of Aalst.

871
01:25:58,235 --> 01:26:03,925
According to him there are only
1400 people on welfare there.

872
01:26:04,135 --> 01:26:05,844
This honourable member,

873
01:26:05,915 --> 01:26:08,124
who is always afraid of being too generous,

874
01:26:08,195 --> 01:26:12,393
calls even this figure exaggerated.

875
01:26:12,555 --> 01:26:17,185
Don't put words in my mouth.
You quote me incompletely.

876
01:26:17,755 --> 01:26:20,508
Two lines written by a man can hang him.

877
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:22,711
Oh, but there are more lines.

878
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:25,230
They come from official documents.

879
01:26:25,395 --> 01:26:28,307
We know this kind of documents.

880
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:32,673
They're secret documents only
for the use of Mr Woeste and friends.

881
01:26:32,875 --> 01:26:35,435
That's not true. Please, enough.

882
01:26:35,675 --> 01:26:38,620
- Sit down, Mr Woeste.
- I'm only beginning.

883
01:26:41,995 --> 01:26:48,025
Mr Woeste, I have here the real
official documents from the Public Administration,

884
01:26:48,195 --> 01:26:53,713
according to which the register
of the poor contains 10,000 needy.

885
01:26:55,635 --> 01:26:58,069
It's still more optimistic than reality.

886
01:26:58,235 --> 01:27:01,989
- I want to explain, Mr President.
- Calm down, Mr Woeste.

887
01:27:02,235 --> 01:27:06,786
You also must explain why
I'd be lying about the workers' wages.

888
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:12,734
I said they were making 10 francs a week.
You questioned that!

889
01:27:13,595 --> 01:27:17,827
You were right: they don't
make 10 francs, but only nine.

890
01:27:18,355 --> 01:27:20,869
And if I should believe a letter

891
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:23,868
from Ninove, they only make 6 to 8 francs.

892
01:27:24,035 --> 01:27:26,833
But Mr Woeste doesn't know all this

893
01:27:26,995 --> 01:27:30,590
because he has never set
foot in a worker's home in Aalst.

894
01:27:30,755 --> 01:27:33,394
He prefers to stay on the balcony
of the town hall,

895
01:27:33,555 --> 01:27:36,069
with the workers at his feet,

896
01:27:36,235 --> 01:27:40,228
waiting for a sausage or a beer.

897
01:27:45,195 --> 01:27:49,154
Finally, allow me to tell you this:

898
01:27:49,315 --> 01:27:52,387
I was walking along the Dender,

899
01:27:52,555 --> 01:27:58,673
when a woman came up to me.
She asked me for alms.

900
01:28:00,035 --> 01:28:04,313
Her husband was out of work.
She had four children,

901
01:28:04,475 --> 01:28:07,865
a 14 year old girl being the eldest,

902
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:13,229
who had finally found work
in a cotton factory,

903
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:17,832
where she had to work, underfed, from 6:00 in the morning

904
01:28:18,115 --> 01:28:21,505
till 7:30 in the evening,

905
01:28:22,155 --> 01:28:27,954
in an unhealthy atmosphere.
Barefoot in tepid water.

906
01:28:29,515 --> 01:28:35,147
Well... do you know how much this young girl,

907
01:28:35,315 --> 01:28:43,285
who in these winter temperatures
must be literally frozen, takes home?

908
01:28:46,515 --> 01:28:51,313
Fifty centimes per day. Per day!

909
01:28:55,715 --> 01:28:58,707
Well, I ask you gentlemen,

910
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:03,512
knowing that at the age of 20,

911
01:29:03,675 --> 01:29:07,463
this girl will be worn out
because of this slave labour,

912
01:29:07,635 --> 01:29:11,344
when in turn she'll be a mother herself,

913
01:29:11,515 --> 01:29:14,746
won't she curse her fate?

914
01:29:16,835 --> 01:29:20,271
Won't she curse the society and the civilization

915
01:29:20,435 --> 01:29:23,632
we are so proud of?

916
01:29:31,955 --> 01:29:35,231
Unity, my friends. Unity.

917
01:29:36,595 --> 01:29:38,870
The Holy Father, who I represent here,

918
01:29:39,075 --> 01:29:44,888
believes that the greatest danger
menacing the catholic world now is disunion.

919
01:29:45,715 --> 01:29:48,752
Unfortunately, I have to admit

920
01:29:48,915 --> 01:29:54,914
that Father Daens is succeeding in
creating dissensions even amongst you!

921
01:29:56,075 --> 01:30:00,709
And who is the guiltiest of
these dissensions, Mr Nuncio?

922
01:30:02,835 --> 01:30:06,384
Father Daens, who suggested an alliance,

923
01:30:06,555 --> 01:30:10,707
or Mr Woeste,
who has rejected it?

924
01:30:11,035 --> 01:30:15,472
The Church is cautious.
It owes a lot to Mr Woeste.

925
01:30:15,635 --> 01:30:20,151
Within the actual disorder
and the growing threat of socialism,

926
01:30:20,315 --> 01:30:23,910
men like Mr Woeste have to be spared.

927
01:30:26,395 --> 01:30:29,148
This attitude is hard
to conciliate with the evolutionary

928
01:30:29,355 --> 01:30:34,410
thoughts of Rerum Novarum.

929
01:30:34,995 --> 01:30:39,068
Rerum Novarum is a general guideline

930
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:43,553
aiming to promote the evolution
of spirits on a long term basis.

931
01:30:43,715 --> 01:30:51,312
By using it as a weapon against the catholic party,
Father Daens is using it without consideration.

932
01:30:56,275 --> 01:31:00,826
That is what I tried to
make him understand, Monseigneur.

933
01:31:01,635 --> 01:31:05,184
Now, I fear it may be too late.

934
01:31:05,515 --> 01:31:08,746
Father Daens is a political man now

935
01:31:08,915 --> 01:31:13,466
and every initiative against him
taken by the Belgian episcopate

936
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:16,707
could be misinterpreted.

937
01:31:17,395 --> 01:31:20,671
Let us not underestimate his popularity.

938
01:31:20,835 --> 01:31:27,707
You're right. I agree with you.
But in that case, who could decide?

939
01:31:28,395 --> 01:31:31,387
The Holy Father himself?

940
01:31:37,915 --> 01:31:39,030
You're sure?

941
01:31:39,195 --> 01:31:43,791
If the Holy Father penalizes Daens,
we will lose all the catholic workers.

942
01:31:43,955 --> 01:31:47,470
But if he receives Daens
without penalizing him,

943
01:31:47,635 --> 01:31:50,513
what a publicity for Daens!

944
01:31:51,315 --> 01:31:57,072
Well, gentlemen, let the Holy
Father decide all this for himself.

945
01:32:01,715 --> 01:32:03,592
No?

946
01:32:04,355 --> 01:32:05,708
Your turn, Monseigneur.

947
01:32:12,315 --> 01:32:17,150
It's done. The Belgian episcopate
passed on the decision to the Holy Father.

948
01:32:17,315 --> 01:32:21,149
Good. It's been a long time since
I requested his Holiness' blessing.

949
01:32:23,715 --> 01:32:28,345
Father! For you,
they just brought it in.

950
01:32:44,635 --> 01:32:46,705
Well?

951
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:49,912
- I have to go to Rome immediately.
- What?

952
01:32:52,995 --> 01:32:57,432
The pope wishes to see you?
Adolf! This is our chance.

953
01:33:01,235 --> 01:33:04,944
Hey, hadn't you better take the train
to Rome, or don't you know

954
01:33:05,115 --> 01:33:08,425
Daens has taken off with Nette?

955
01:33:10,075 --> 01:33:13,147
Having coffee with the pope.

956
01:33:32,115 --> 01:33:36,267
Are you wearing this
posh suit for Sunday mass?

957
01:33:36,435 --> 01:33:38,824
I brought you something.

958
01:33:40,355 --> 01:33:44,348
You'll see that our bread is
at least as good as in Aalst.

959
01:33:44,995 --> 01:33:47,828
I suppose you need something?

960
01:33:48,995 --> 01:33:51,509
You don't have to blush.

961
01:33:51,675 --> 01:33:55,907
I thought... I thought
we might get married.

962
01:33:56,235 --> 01:33:58,430
That is, if you want to?

963
01:33:58,595 --> 01:34:02,065
They certainly move fast in Ghent?

964
01:34:03,435 --> 01:34:06,586
- Or is there something else you'd like?
- No,

965
01:34:07,035 --> 01:34:09,469
or yes, that too.

966
01:34:10,275 --> 01:34:15,030
We could live in Ghent and you
wouldn't have to work in the factory, see?

967
01:34:15,195 --> 01:34:17,993
I would be marrying a socialist?

968
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:22,865
I would agree with the church wedding,
if Daens performs the mass

969
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:26,954
and the "Forwards" band plays for us.

970
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:36,508
My father plays for St. Cecilia.

971
01:34:36,675 --> 01:34:40,429
Could be nice with the two bands.

972
01:34:43,835 --> 01:34:46,030
Come on, let's go.

973
01:34:55,435 --> 01:34:57,073
One beer.

974
01:35:04,195 --> 01:35:06,470
- That's mine.
- You can't afford it.

975
01:35:06,635 --> 01:35:08,432
Oh, yes, I can.

976
01:35:08,595 --> 01:35:10,506
- You have no job.
- I have a job.

977
01:35:10,675 --> 01:35:12,745
No more.

978
01:35:13,235 --> 01:35:15,590
All swines that voted for Daens are fired.

979
01:35:15,755 --> 01:35:18,906
- Fool, I can't vote. I'm too young.
- Doesn't matter.

980
01:35:19,075 --> 01:35:21,145
I'll tell Daens.

981
01:35:22,075 --> 01:35:25,431
You won't see Daens anymore.
He's stuck in Rome.

982
01:35:25,715 --> 01:35:28,991
In a prison for crazy priests.

983
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,600
Here you are.

984
01:36:14,955 --> 01:36:17,594
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thanks.

985
01:36:41,075 --> 01:36:43,305
Reverend Daens...

986
01:36:58,395 --> 01:37:01,592
His Holiness can't see you today.

987
01:37:01,755 --> 01:37:03,666
Come back tomorrow, same time.

988
01:37:04,555 --> 01:37:09,424
I'm sorry, but I understood
that my convocation was urgent.

989
01:37:09,875 --> 01:37:14,914
- Is there no mistake?
- I am sorry.

990
01:37:15,675 --> 01:37:19,714
Even with Daens in
parliament it still stinks in here.

991
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:22,389
That's your fault, not Daens'.

992
01:37:22,555 --> 01:37:25,353
Daens is sitting on a holy pot now.

993
01:37:25,515 --> 01:37:29,394
- I wonder what that'll change here.
- We'll all get rich, won't we?

994
01:37:29,555 --> 01:37:32,786
We'll come and shit in top hats.

995
01:37:35,715 --> 01:37:38,309
Gust, give me a piece of "Workman".

996
01:37:38,835 --> 01:37:42,464
We're not out of it yet.

997
01:37:44,675 --> 01:37:48,429
Feels good.
Here, one for Schmitt!

998
01:37:51,515 --> 01:37:55,190
Cuppens, Segers, Vlanders,
Poekens, you're fired.

999
01:37:55,675 --> 01:37:59,065
- I just got here!
- All Daensists out!

1000
01:38:08,995 --> 01:38:10,986
Reverend Daens...

1001
01:38:19,155 --> 01:38:21,828
Again, I'm sorry.

1002
01:38:24,715 --> 01:38:28,867
But... there's nobody here.
What does that mean?

1003
01:38:29,315 --> 01:38:32,671
You may be more lucky tomorrow.

1004
01:38:35,715 --> 01:38:37,353
See you tomorrow.

1005
01:39:15,435 --> 01:39:17,426
Jefke...

1006
01:39:22,595 --> 01:39:25,644
Where are Jef, Maria and the rest?

1007
01:39:26,315 --> 01:39:28,067
I threw them out.

1008
01:39:28,235 --> 01:39:30,032
Why?

1009
01:39:31,395 --> 01:39:33,033
They're dirty reds, like you.

1010
01:39:33,195 --> 01:39:36,551
Then why did you keep me?

1011
01:39:36,715 --> 01:39:40,105
Come on, Nette.
Be kind to Schmitt.

1012
01:39:40,435 --> 01:39:43,905
If you touch me, I'll tell Daens.
You'll answer to parliament.

1013
01:39:44,075 --> 01:39:47,624
To whom? To Daens?

1014
01:39:53,955 --> 01:39:55,513
Just come here.

1015
01:40:26,235 --> 01:40:31,707
You can tell your Daens, that
now you know how he has to do it.

1016
01:40:41,115 --> 01:40:43,231
Jan...

1017
01:41:19,715 --> 01:41:23,833
- Who will feed them all?
- Goddamn!

1018
01:41:27,195 --> 01:41:30,824
Don't interfere, brat.
Where have you been?

1019
01:41:30,995 --> 01:41:34,032
You'd better help your mother.

1020
01:41:34,195 --> 01:41:36,186
What's wrong with you?

1021
01:41:36,355 --> 01:41:39,904
I know what's wrong...
That red one got her mouse, eh?

1022
01:41:44,115 --> 01:41:47,232
He's crazy.
She'll kill him.

1023
01:42:13,755 --> 01:42:17,304
Go away, Louis. Go on, go!

1024
01:42:18,835 --> 01:42:21,952
All right. All right, I'm gone.

1025
01:42:23,995 --> 01:42:27,671
Damn it! I'm gone for good!

1026
01:42:28,795 --> 01:42:32,265
And forget about my wages.

1027
01:42:32,995 --> 01:42:37,432
She can walk the
streets like all Daens' women.

1028
01:42:42,209 --> 01:42:44,409
- Damn it!

1029
01:42:44,835 --> 01:42:46,791
Go to bed, you.

1030
01:43:03,595 --> 01:43:05,904
What happened?

1031
01:43:07,555 --> 01:43:10,149
Was it Schmitt?

1032
01:43:39,835 --> 01:43:42,224
Father Daens, please.

1033
01:43:54,350 --> 01:43:55,598
Monseigneur...

1034
01:43:55,789 --> 01:43:57,737
His Holiness sends you this.

1035
01:44:09,075 --> 01:44:12,863
- I don't understand.
- Yet, you understand Latin?

1036
01:44:13,150 --> 01:44:14,763
Allow me...

1037
01:44:15,534 --> 01:44:18,049
You must do everything to promote piety,

1038
01:44:18,995 --> 01:44:24,115
slant your speeches towards
justice, love and cautiousness.

1039
01:44:24,275 --> 01:44:29,808
Your dignity and honour
as a priest must prevail.

1040
01:44:30,315 --> 01:44:32,545
Don't mix with those

1041
01:44:32,715 --> 01:44:36,503
who want to overthrow society

1042
01:44:36,675 --> 01:44:44,946
and avoid to cause any
dissent within the catholic party.

1043
01:44:46,195 --> 01:44:48,072
That's clear enough, isn't it?

1044
01:44:48,235 --> 01:44:51,625
I understood, but this is wrong!

1045
01:44:51,795 --> 01:44:58,234
What do you mean, wrong? The Church
is telling you keep away from the socialists.

1046
01:44:58,395 --> 01:45:01,671
Or else, it will abandon you.

1047
01:45:03,115 --> 01:45:05,675
I must see his Holiness.

1048
01:45:05,835 --> 01:45:08,474
I must speak to him about our workers.

1049
01:45:08,635 --> 01:45:12,548
I'm sure he doesn't know
their real situation in my country.

1050
01:45:15,715 --> 01:45:18,183
I must explain it to him!

1051
01:46:03,915 --> 01:46:06,110
Adolf...

1052
01:46:07,075 --> 01:46:09,031
Send them home. I won't see anyone.

1053
01:46:09,195 --> 01:46:11,983
You're crazy? They come for you.

1054
01:46:12,150 --> 01:46:13,471
Pieter!

1055
01:46:15,462 --> 01:46:17,900
The pope didn't see me.

1056
01:46:19,795 --> 01:46:23,151
Father, what did the pope say?

1057
01:46:44,755 --> 01:46:49,465
Dear friends, I am
grateful for your affection.

1058
01:46:50,835 --> 01:46:54,794
In Rome, I have
accomplished important things.

1059
01:46:54,955 --> 01:46:59,107
We will fight on together,
and achieve the ideas expressed

1060
01:46:59,275 --> 01:47:03,985
in the encyclical of the pope.

1061
01:47:04,755 --> 01:47:09,351
But unity should go along with justice.

1062
01:47:09,675 --> 01:47:12,712
One can't occur without the other.

1063
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:17,707
You can always rely
on me, in life and death.

1064
01:47:47,795 --> 01:47:52,346
I've been told the workers
should go to school. What for?

1065
01:47:52,515 --> 01:47:55,632
What do they really get out of it?

1066
01:47:55,795 --> 01:47:59,424
To be able to read papers,
like that one, for instance?

1067
01:48:00,395 --> 01:48:06,072
Papers that confirm that a certain
priest had an audience by the pope.

1068
01:48:06,235 --> 01:48:11,455
In the first place,
this priest was summoned to Rome,

1069
01:48:11,515 --> 01:48:15,527
for disciplinary reasons, and secondly,

1070
01:48:15,535 --> 01:48:18,832
according to trustworthy sources at the Vatican,

1071
01:48:18,895 --> 01:48:22,652
has never had the honour of being
personally admonished by the pope.

1072
01:48:23,395 --> 01:48:26,910
And these very same liars want
to teach us a lesson in morals,

1073
01:48:27,075 --> 01:48:31,529
while acting as if they were
upholding virtue and religion?

1074
01:48:32,035 --> 01:48:34,230
Mr President, I wish to speak.

1075
01:48:34,835 --> 01:48:36,985
Ask the pope!

1076
01:48:38,035 --> 01:48:40,993
Let him talk. Respect your priests.

1077
01:48:42,995 --> 01:48:47,273
Mister Daens, you have
seen who your friends are.

1078
01:48:54,115 --> 01:48:59,553
My dear parishioners, it is with our great regret

1079
01:48:59,715 --> 01:49:05,392
that we have to ban the writings
by the Daens brothers for all of you.

1080
01:49:05,555 --> 01:49:12,105
Or we will lose our eternal soul.

1081
01:49:12,955 --> 01:49:15,389
Dear parishioners,

1082
01:49:15,555 --> 01:49:20,106
let us pray that this ban
imposed by our dear bishop

1083
01:49:20,395 --> 01:49:25,230
may lead our lost
sheep back to the right trail.

1084
01:49:33,515 --> 01:49:36,106
Nette is ill.

1085
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:44,348
We need money urgently, Adolf.

1086
01:49:44,515 --> 01:49:47,587
Your allowance is enough for food,

1087
01:49:47,755 --> 01:49:50,110
but it can't support a party.

1088
01:49:50,275 --> 01:49:53,312
We'll have to get
organized like the socialists,

1089
01:49:53,475 --> 01:49:55,511
with our own bakery, own weaving mill

1090
01:49:55,675 --> 01:49:59,384
and even a savings bank so
people get paid, even when ill.

1091
01:49:59,555 --> 01:50:03,264
Pieter, that's not the problem now.
I got orders.

1092
01:50:03,435 --> 01:50:06,188
The pope wants me to resign.

1093
01:50:06,835 --> 01:50:11,386
That's impossible!
All these people fought for you and voted for you.

1094
01:50:11,555 --> 01:50:16,470
These people fought for a cause,
like you and I, not for a person.

1095
01:50:16,995 --> 01:50:19,555
My superiors force me to silence

1096
01:50:19,715 --> 01:50:22,627
but that doesn't ruin the cause.

1097
01:50:23,075 --> 01:50:26,590
Without you it will, you know it.

1098
01:50:41,475 --> 01:50:43,625
Pier, want some more?

1099
01:50:46,075 --> 01:50:51,195
Friends, I just met the socialists.
Their cooperative needs 20 people immediately.

1100
01:50:51,355 --> 01:50:53,869
Jan will tell you more.

1101
01:50:54,035 --> 01:50:57,471
Comrades, we'll pay 10 francs and soup.

1102
01:50:57,675 --> 01:50:59,950
We have soup.
But not 10 francs. Come let's go.

1103
01:51:00,115 --> 01:51:03,232
Women take the flags!

1104
01:51:03,395 --> 01:51:06,068
No! No flags!

1105
01:51:06,795 --> 01:51:10,470
Those who want it, can work for
the socialists, but not as Daensists.

1106
01:51:10,635 --> 01:51:13,911
No Christian flag over there.

1107
01:51:14,155 --> 01:51:17,670
Religion doesn't butter our bread, Father.

1108
01:51:17,835 --> 01:51:22,067
My son lost his job because I spoke to you.

1109
01:51:25,355 --> 01:51:29,507
We mustn't forget the
socialists are our enemies.

1110
01:51:31,555 --> 01:51:34,069
We'll never vote for you again.

1111
01:51:34,915 --> 01:51:38,146
Why do you say that, Father?

1112
01:51:39,555 --> 01:51:42,831
The socialists are workers like us.

1113
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:47,147
Who beats us up?
The directors, the Bucks.

1114
01:51:47,355 --> 01:51:51,906
The bishops give you a hard time.

1115
01:51:52,755 --> 01:51:56,404
Why do you stay with them?
Why do you obey them?

1116
01:51:56,675 --> 01:52:01,646
You, who's supposed to get us out of the shit.

1117
01:52:02,075 --> 01:52:06,353
Why can't you stop their turning on us?

1118
01:52:11,755 --> 01:52:14,872
We will have to suffer even more.

1119
01:52:23,915 --> 01:52:26,224
Nette...

1120
01:52:27,555 --> 01:52:30,513
do not abandon our Lord.

1121
01:52:33,635 --> 01:52:36,866
If you don't abandon us.

1122
01:52:44,715 --> 01:52:49,266
Nette, hey, don't worry.
He is a priest forever.

1123
01:52:49,435 --> 01:52:50,874
How would you know?

1124
01:52:51,350 --> 01:52:54,066
You can see he's trying to save his skin.

1125
01:52:55,900 --> 01:52:57,652
That's not true.

1126
01:52:59,770 --> 01:53:01,570
Nette...

1127
01:53:07,035 --> 01:53:08,707
Nette, wait!

1128
01:53:08,995 --> 01:53:15,123
Nette! Your Daens is a bastard. You hear?
Without us he is nothing. A nobody.

1129
01:53:15,650 --> 01:53:16,737
Damn it!

1130
01:53:17,788 --> 01:53:19,756
Nette, I love you!

1131
01:53:29,035 --> 01:53:30,514
No, don't be afraid.

1132
01:53:30,675 --> 01:53:34,554
Our dear director of missions
has chosen him specially for me.

1133
01:53:34,755 --> 01:53:39,545
- Which tribe does he belong to?
- He's a Baluba, Sire, from Kassai.

1134
01:53:40,315 --> 01:53:43,148
Sire, isn't he dangerous?

1135
01:53:43,355 --> 01:53:45,915
Don't fear. He's gentle, sociable.

1136
01:53:46,595 --> 01:53:48,984
- Is he baptized?
- Yes, of course.

1137
01:53:49,155 --> 01:53:52,864
A better catholic than some whites.

1138
01:53:53,715 --> 01:53:56,787
By the way, Monseigneur,

1139
01:53:56,955 --> 01:54:00,709
have they finally put
an end to the Aalst scandal?

1140
01:54:00,875 --> 01:54:05,630
- What about that priest?
- Mr Woeste knows, sire.

1141
01:54:05,795 --> 01:54:10,505
We have proposed a solution.
It's up to him to give the answer.

1142
01:54:11,515 --> 01:54:15,349
- Well, Mr Woeste?
- It is not a real solution, sire.

1143
01:54:15,515 --> 01:54:20,464
Father Daens demands that his seat
be transferred to another Christian democrat.

1144
01:54:20,635 --> 01:54:25,311
It's out of the question.
Daens has to leave unconditionally.

1145
01:54:26,155 --> 01:54:29,830
The Christian democrats
spread the bed for socialism,

1146
01:54:29,995 --> 01:54:35,991
and since the Church doesn't act
efficiently, I will make the necessary moves.

1147
01:54:36,835 --> 01:54:38,746
Perfect, Mr Woeste.

1148
01:54:47,800 --> 01:54:49,800
Daens!

1149
01:54:55,075 --> 01:55:00,749
- Daens come on out if you dare!
- Come along to the cemetery.

1150
01:55:01,115 --> 01:55:02,468
The grave is ready.

1151
01:55:02,635 --> 01:55:06,674
Look, priest of the devil.
Look, what'll happen to you.

1152
01:55:10,800 --> 01:55:12,200
Daens!

1153
01:55:13,315 --> 01:55:16,864
Step outside, priest!
So, we can hang you.

1154
01:55:17,035 --> 01:55:20,246
Are you scared, bastard?

1155
01:55:20,715 --> 01:55:22,785
Black crow, where are you?

1156
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:24,794
Come out, Daens!

1157
01:55:24,795 --> 01:55:27,150
Adolf Daens! Coward!

1158
01:55:27,995 --> 01:55:30,589
Show your faces, cowards!

1159
01:55:30,755 --> 01:55:34,384
We want your brother, printer.
Father Daens!

1160
01:55:37,315 --> 01:55:39,271
Come on, you coward.

1161
01:55:40,096 --> 01:55:42,096
The print shop!

1162
01:55:52,795 --> 01:55:55,184
To the printers! Let's go!

1163
01:56:10,195 --> 01:56:12,390
Burn the "Workman"!

1164
01:56:25,595 --> 01:56:29,805
The Bucks are attacking
the Daens'. They'll destroy everything.

1165
01:56:57,115 --> 01:57:00,994
- Father, the Bucks!
- The Bucks? They're everywhere.

1166
01:57:01,635 --> 01:57:03,546
Better come with me!

1167
01:57:08,235 --> 01:57:10,226
- What's going on?
- The Bucks.

1168
01:57:10,395 --> 01:57:13,592
They've been at your
brother's too. But nobody got hurt.

1169
01:57:13,755 --> 01:57:16,110
Where is Pier?

1170
01:57:18,835 --> 01:57:19,948
But Father!

1171
01:57:19,973 --> 01:57:22,373
Pier!

1172
01:57:45,995 --> 01:57:48,225
Come on, Pier.

1173
01:57:51,635 --> 01:57:53,405
Why are you still here?

1174
01:58:44,515 --> 01:58:46,349
It's not so bad.

1175
01:58:56,075 --> 01:59:00,944
Pieter, listen to me
and don't talk back for once.

1176
01:59:02,155 --> 01:59:05,113
Stillemans will find me something.

1177
01:59:05,275 --> 01:59:08,631
Try to save whatever you can.

1178
01:59:10,315 --> 01:59:12,545
I'm pulling out.

1179
01:59:14,235 --> 01:59:17,511
Do it for Louise and the children.

1180
01:59:30,715 --> 01:59:32,910
"Autumn"

1181
01:59:34,155 --> 01:59:40,464
"Under high, big trees
in a very dark wood,

1182
01:59:41,555 --> 01:59:48,633
where hardly anybody ever comes,
you'll find acorns spread on the moss.

1183
01:59:49,595 --> 01:59:56,926
Many clever young animals really like these acorns

1184
01:59:57,515 --> 02:00:03,287
for the fair when winter comes."

1185
02:00:07,515 --> 02:00:10,587
5 loaves and 2 fishes, he said.

1186
02:00:19,675 --> 02:00:21,666
Our Father, who art in heaven

1187
02:00:21,875 --> 02:00:24,184
hallowed be Thy name. Thy Kingdom come.

1188
02:00:24,395 --> 02:00:26,989
Thy will be done on earth and in heaven.

1189
02:00:27,155 --> 02:00:30,386
Give us our daily bread.

1190
02:00:33,715 --> 02:00:38,186
- Our Father, who art in heaven...
- Your miracle won't work!

1191
02:00:38,355 --> 02:00:42,394
- Let's go steak some beets.
- I'm coming, I'm hungry.

1192
02:00:47,675 --> 02:00:53,466
Father Daens? As abbot of this
convent, I must tell you that you are here

1193
02:00:53,635 --> 02:00:57,264
upon Monseigneur Stillemans' request.
You are lucky that we

1194
02:00:57,435 --> 02:01:03,168
respect the duty of obedience.
Don't forget that.

1195
02:01:06,115 --> 02:01:08,345
By the way...

1196
02:01:10,075 --> 02:01:14,273
Don't get any illusions about your flock here.

1197
02:01:14,435 --> 02:01:17,268
They are beyond your reach.

1198
02:01:24,995 --> 02:01:29,989
The only thing expected from you,
is that you read from the Bible,

1199
02:01:30,595 --> 02:01:33,473
because they can't read anymore.

1200
02:01:43,675 --> 02:01:49,750
You can start right away. The book is
open at the first letter to the Corinthians.

1201
02:02:00,075 --> 02:02:03,954
Our Father, who art in heaven
hallowed be Thy name.

1202
02:02:04,115 --> 02:02:07,312
Thy Kingdom come.
Thy will be done on earth

1203
02:02:07,475 --> 02:02:11,150
and in heaven.
Give us our daily bread.

1204
02:02:12,555 --> 02:02:16,992
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

1205
02:02:23,715 --> 02:02:26,548
My task is to spread God's Word,

1206
02:02:26,795 --> 02:02:31,994
but these men don't need it:
they are with God!

1207
02:02:32,235 --> 02:02:35,227
We're talking about you, not them!

1208
02:02:35,395 --> 02:02:39,274
Without the Church you are lost.

1209
02:02:40,075 --> 02:02:43,485
This was your last chance, Daens!

1210
02:02:43,655 --> 02:02:47,425
The Church has no
place for you anymore!

1211
02:02:47,475 --> 02:02:50,609
You are no longer a priest!

1212
02:03:23,315 --> 02:03:25,351
He didn't confess before he died.

1213
02:03:25,515 --> 02:03:29,110
He's a sinner, I can't bury
him. You know that very well.

1214
02:03:29,275 --> 02:03:32,711
Must we bury him like a dog?

1215
02:03:33,515 --> 02:03:39,192
- This is a child, Father!  - He's a thief,
everyone knows that. Age has nothing to do with it.

1216
02:03:39,595 --> 02:03:41,472
Who's that child?

1217
02:03:46,035 --> 02:03:48,947
It's Jefke, Father.

1218
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:11,389
He was hungry.

1219
02:04:13,995 --> 02:04:18,193
He wanted to pinch
the meat from the wild animals.

1220
02:04:19,755 --> 02:04:23,111
- Have his parents been told?
- He's got none.

1221
02:04:23,275 --> 02:04:26,073
He won't bury him.

1222
02:04:28,195 --> 02:04:31,505
- Come, let me do it.
- You are no longer a priest.

1223
02:04:33,195 --> 02:04:36,631
You can't even wear the cloth.

1224
02:04:40,355 --> 02:04:44,473
- What are you doing?
- Like you say...

1225
02:04:45,755 --> 02:04:50,385
Priesthood, Ponnet,
has nothing to do with an outfit.

1226
02:04:52,795 --> 02:04:55,309
Don't do it!

1227
02:04:55,475 --> 02:04:57,705
That's blasphemy! Adolf!

1228
02:04:58,755 --> 02:05:03,545
Our Father, who art in heaven...

1229
02:05:03,715 --> 02:05:05,433
Don't follow him.

1230
02:05:07,095 --> 02:05:10,007
It's a mortal sin.

1231
02:05:16,715 --> 02:05:20,744
The Church will destroy
you, like all heretics.

1232
02:05:23,355 --> 02:05:28,987
Friends, may the death
of this innocent child,

1233
02:05:29,435 --> 02:05:34,429
murdered, by egotism and misery,

1234
02:05:34,715 --> 02:05:42,651
always remind us that, in this
turbulent struggle, there's only one enemy:

1235
02:05:43,755 --> 02:05:50,029
those who will exploit you;
and only one ally:

1236
02:05:50,995 --> 02:05:55,067
those who are suffering beside you and with you.

1237
02:07:21,475 --> 02:07:24,433
We'll call our first one Jefke.

1238
02:07:49,675 --> 02:07:53,033
Adolf Daens died in 1907
after a 2nd term in parliament.

1239
02:07:53,275 --> 02:07:57,233
"He was buried on Monday at 9.00 a.m.
Only poor people were present,

1240
02:07:57,475 --> 02:08:02,933
women with black scarves, workers,
strikers and a silent crowd..."

1241
