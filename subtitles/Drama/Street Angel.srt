1
00:03:13,798 --> 00:03:15,322
Are you crazy?

2
00:03:15,366 --> 00:03:17,197
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

3
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:19,134
- Hi, Mom.
- Don't "Hi, Mom" me.

4
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,694
What are you still doing up?
It's past 1:00.

5
00:03:20,738 --> 00:03:24,697
- I thought I'd wait for you.
- Well, I'm home.

6
00:03:24,742 --> 00:03:26,676
Now you can get to sleep.
Come on.

7
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,871
Andale.

8
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,447
I'm really not tired.

9
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:34,246
Kristen, don't start with me.
You know what your shrink said.

10
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,912
He's full of it.

11
00:03:35,953 --> 00:03:37,614
I'm not going to let you
get me into an argument.

12
00:03:37,655 --> 00:03:39,213
Now get to sleep.

13
00:03:39,256 --> 00:03:44,558
Mom, I'm still having
those awful dreams.

14
00:03:44,595 --> 00:03:46,859
Elaine,
where do you keep the bourbon?

15
00:03:47,898 --> 00:03:51,197
I'll be right down.
I've got a guest.

16
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:53,328
And you don't want
to keep him waiting?

17
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,201
That's right. I don't.

18
00:03:57,808 --> 00:03:58,968
Good night.

19
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:53,920
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

20
00:04:53,964 --> 00:04:58,424
Three, four,
better lock your door

21
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:03,099
Five, six, grab a crucifix

22
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,009
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

23
00:05:08,045 --> 00:05:12,709
Nine, ten, never sleep again

24
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,187
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

25
00:05:17,221 --> 00:05:20,918
Three, four,
better lock your door

26
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:25,054
Five, six, grab a crucifix

27
00:05:25,095 --> 00:05:29,998
Seven, eight, gonna stay up late

28
00:05:30,034 --> 00:05:32,298
Nine, ten...

29
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:46,839
Hi. What's your name?

30
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:49,944
Kristen. What's yours?

31
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:54,547
What is this place?

32
00:05:56,794 --> 00:05:59,319
I got to go now.

33
00:06:00,464 --> 00:06:02,193
Wait, little girl.
Don't go in there!

34
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:06,228
Little girl?

35
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:51,479
This is where he takes us.

36
00:06:52,516 --> 00:06:53,505
Come on. We're going.

37
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,591
Freddy's home.

38
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:11,092
Put me down. You're hurting me.

39
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,668
And in local news, two more
teenage deaths have occurred...

40
00:09:29,706 --> 00:09:30,934
both suicides.

41
00:09:30,974 --> 00:09:32,999
County health officials
are at a loss to explain...

42
00:09:33,043 --> 00:09:35,102
this alarming trend.

43
00:09:35,145 --> 00:09:38,876
Nothing like a little
cheery news to start the day.

44
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:42,875
Doc, I got a new theory
about all these suicides.

45
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,889
Don't hold back on us, Max.
We need all the help we can get.

46
00:09:45,923 --> 00:09:48,323
It's fucked-up chromosomes.
Think about it.

47
00:09:48,358 --> 00:09:50,918
All their parents dropped acid
during the sixties.

48
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:52,428
It beats Simms' theory.

49
00:09:52,463 --> 00:09:55,091
She thinks it's sex,
drugs, and rock 'n' roll.

50
00:09:55,132 --> 00:09:57,726
Shit.
That's what keeps people alive.

51
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:00,669
Hi, Taryn.

52
00:10:00,704 --> 00:10:03,400
You don't look so hot, kid.
Are you getting some sleep?

53
00:10:05,109 --> 00:10:06,235
I didn't think so.

54
00:10:06,276 --> 00:10:07,402
Good morning, Dr. Gordon.

55
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:09,309
Good morning, Jennifer.
How are the burns?

56
00:10:09,346 --> 00:10:10,973
Regular, menthol, ultra-light.

57
00:10:11,014 --> 00:10:12,481
They're healing up nicely.

58
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:16,475
I've been good. When do I get
my cigarette privileges back?

59
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,579
Don't hold your breath.

60
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:21,484
- Phillip.
- Hey, Doc.

61
00:10:31,201 --> 00:10:32,498
How is he?

62
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:34,026
He's cooling down.

63
00:10:34,071 --> 00:10:36,005
If he continues having
these outbursts...

64
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,303
I'll have to have him
isolated permanently.

65
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:39,900
Don't worry.
It won't come to that.

66
00:10:41,044 --> 00:10:44,138
I read the report
on the new staff member.

67
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,705
What did you think?

68
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:49,685
I don't understand why
some grad school superstar...

69
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,245
is being treated
like a seasoned pro.

70
00:10:52,289 --> 00:10:54,985
She's doing ground-breaking
research on pattern nightmares.

71
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:58,984
We don't need any outside help.
I know these kids.

72
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:02,055
I don't want some hotshot
taking chances with them...

73
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:03,794
just so she can get published.

74
00:11:03,834 --> 00:11:06,894
Dr. Gordon, Dr. Simms,
to examination, stat.

75
00:11:09,773 --> 00:11:12,333
This is ridiculous.
I know my daughter.

76
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:14,173
She's just trying
to get some attention.

77
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,042
I won't play one of her
little games with her.

78
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,707
Suicide attempt.
Just down from Country General.

79
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,148
- What's her name?
- Kristen Parker.

80
00:11:20,184 --> 00:11:22,812
She was fine
until we tried sedating her.

81
00:11:27,024 --> 00:11:28,685
She tore her stitches out.

82
00:11:28,725 --> 00:11:31,387
Kristen, we want to help you!

83
00:11:32,496 --> 00:11:33,724
Hold her.

84
00:11:38,602 --> 00:11:41,503
I'm Dr. Gordon.
I want to help you.

85
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:46,638
Be careful, Max!

86
00:11:47,544 --> 00:11:49,011
Back off, Max.

87
00:11:49,046 --> 00:11:52,209
Kristen, put the scalpel down.

88
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,547
Nobody's going to hurt you.

89
00:11:57,854 --> 00:12:01,984
Five, six, grab your crucifix

90
00:12:03,093 --> 00:12:07,962
Seven, eight,
better stay up late

91
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:13,235
Nine, ten, never, never...

92
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,703
Never sleep again.

93
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:24,306
Where did you learn that rhyme?

94
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:39,420
Tell me about the kids.

95
00:12:40,631 --> 00:12:44,431
Well, they're survivors
in a way.

96
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,493
They're all severely
sleep disordered...

97
00:12:46,536 --> 00:12:49,130
insomnia, narcolepsy,
bed-wetting.

98
00:12:49,172 --> 00:12:51,003
But the nightmares
are their common thread?

99
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,874
Right.
They share a group delusion...

100
00:12:53,910 --> 00:12:56,435
a boogieman,
for lack of a better word.

101
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,141
They're so traumatized...

102
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,308
they'll do almost anything
not to sleep.

103
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,783
Anything?

104
00:13:04,421 --> 00:13:07,720
We lost a kid a month ago
to Fairview.

105
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:09,726
I don't know where
he got the razors...

106
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,455
but he cut off his own eyelids
to stay awake.

107
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,224
Oh, God.

108
00:13:13,263 --> 00:13:15,197
Shook the kids up pretty badly.

109
00:13:16,033 --> 00:13:19,332
By the way, that was great work
with the new patient.

110
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:20,734
Pretty smooth for an intern.

111
00:13:20,771 --> 00:13:23,899
I have had some experience
with pattern nightmares.

112
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,002
I've got to get going.

113
00:13:28,645 --> 00:13:30,579
Let me help you.

114
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:35,445
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

115
00:13:37,854 --> 00:13:40,755
Now, be sure
that you check in with Max.

116
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:43,021
He'll give you
the whole twenty-five-cent tour.

117
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,053
I'll see you later.

118
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:47,563
Oh, Miss Thompson...

119
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:48,723
You can call me Nancy.

120
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,962
You call me Neil.

121
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:54,459
What was that nursery rhyme
all about?

122
00:13:54,504 --> 00:13:57,405
It was just something
that the kids say...

123
00:13:57,441 --> 00:14:00,433
to keep the... boogieman away.

124
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:26,296
Anyway, that's group therapy.

125
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:29,433
This whole wing
is devoted to the program.

126
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:33,006
I guess... yeah.

127
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:35,511
You can use this office
for the time being.

128
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:37,103
This will be fine.

129
00:14:37,814 --> 00:14:39,839
I'll have you set up
in your own space...

130
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:41,714
by the end of the week.

131
00:14:41,752 --> 00:14:43,982
The patients' rooms
are down this way.

132
00:14:49,359 --> 00:14:52,726
This is Phillip.
We call him "The Walker."

133
00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:55,732
- Why is that?
- Because I sleepwalk.

134
00:14:55,766 --> 00:14:58,291
A perfectly normal event
that our illustrious staff...

135
00:14:58,335 --> 00:15:01,031
loves to theorize about
endlessly.

136
00:15:01,071 --> 00:15:02,698
Phillip, this is Nancy.

137
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:06,038
Hi. Welcome to the snake pit.

138
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,302
Thanks.

139
00:15:09,946 --> 00:15:11,243
Nice work.

140
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:13,010
They really ought to be carved
out of wood...

141
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:14,778
but they won't let me have
a knife.

142
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,112
I might, you know...

143
00:15:22,993 --> 00:15:26,793
This lump over here is Kincaid.
Take a good look.

144
00:15:27,531 --> 00:15:30,125
He gets himself thrown in
the quiet room so often...

145
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:32,692
you probably won't see
a lot of him.

146
00:15:32,736 --> 00:15:37,673
I do it so I don't have to look
at your ugly face all the time.

147
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:39,106
I love you, too.

148
00:15:39,142 --> 00:15:40,404
Nice meeting you.

149
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:47,507
They're really good kids,
but don't let them fool you.

150
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:50,850
They're dangerous...
to themselves and to each other.

151
00:15:58,795 --> 00:15:59,989
Hi, Joey.

152
00:16:02,466 --> 00:16:04,195
Why, thank you.

153
00:16:05,302 --> 00:16:07,361
- Hey, Marcie. How you doing?
- Great.

154
00:16:07,404 --> 00:16:10,601
These going to "C" Ward?
I'll walk you down.

155
00:16:11,575 --> 00:16:13,202
See you later, Joey.

156
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:24,518
Mrs. Parker, was Kristen
acting any different?

157
00:16:24,988 --> 00:16:28,583
Did you notice anything strange
before she made the attempt?

158
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,752
Kristen specializes
in strangeness.

159
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:33,228
I've spent thousands
on psychiatrists.

160
00:16:34,998 --> 00:16:36,966
Did she always have nightmares?

161
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,935
No. They've gotten worse since
I took away her credit cards.

162
00:16:41,037 --> 00:16:42,504
I'm serious.

163
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:44,564
I don't know
what you want from me.

164
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,734
Just some answers.

165
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:47,766
Other kids are involved,
not just Kristen.

166
00:16:47,811 --> 00:16:49,802
All good kids, smart kids.

167
00:16:49,846 --> 00:16:53,304
I'm sorry to hear that.
You're the experts, not me.

168
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,113
If I had any insight
into any of this...

169
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:57,176
I would share them with you,
believe me.

170
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,687
I'm sure you would.

171
00:16:58,722 --> 00:17:00,713
Excuse me.
I have to get downtown.

172
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:02,918
I'll need to get her things.

173
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:06,451
I had them packed
in a suitcase. Teresa.

174
00:17:08,198 --> 00:17:10,928
I'll get them.
Please, I don't mind.

175
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:13,663
It's the first door
at the top of the stairs.

176
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:18,133
You.

177
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:20,870
Oh, my God. Run!

178
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:25,813
Get us back out, Kristen!
Do it now!

179
00:22:44,067 --> 00:22:45,694
I used to live in this house.

180
00:22:45,735 --> 00:22:47,703
That's just a house
I dream about.

181
00:22:47,737 --> 00:22:49,898
Have you ever done that
before...

182
00:22:49,939 --> 00:22:53,238
pulled someone into your dream?

183
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:57,406
When I was a little girl,
like four or five...

184
00:22:57,447 --> 00:23:00,541
if I had a nightmare,
I'd always bring my dad in.

185
00:23:01,684 --> 00:23:03,174
The dreams
would always get better.

186
00:23:04,487 --> 00:23:06,978
He used to tell me about it
the next day.

187
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,651
He used to think
they were his dreams.

188
00:23:10,493 --> 00:23:12,393
When did that stop?

189
00:23:13,396 --> 00:23:15,864
When I was still a kid.

190
00:23:15,899 --> 00:23:18,732
My folks got divorced,
and after a while...

191
00:23:18,768 --> 00:23:20,633
I just thought
I imagined the whole thing.

192
00:23:21,704 --> 00:23:23,467
I guess I didn't.

193
00:23:23,506 --> 00:23:25,531
It's an amazing gift.

194
00:23:26,576 --> 00:23:29,943
The man in my dreams,
he's real, isn't he?

195
00:23:34,117 --> 00:23:35,675
He's real.

196
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,888
OK. Group's in session.

197
00:23:38,922 --> 00:23:41,288
Straight talk only in this room.

198
00:23:41,324 --> 00:23:44,225
Today I'd like to start
getting us acquainted...

199
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,491
with our new staff member
Nancy Thompson.

200
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,895
Let's make her welcome.

201
00:23:52,068 --> 00:23:53,831
You've already met
Phillip and Kincaid...

202
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,235
and, of course, Kristen.

203
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:59,332
How about the rest of you tell
Nancy about yourselves?

204
00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:03,969
Will, how about you first?

205
00:24:04,013 --> 00:24:06,277
Hi, I'm Will Stanton.

206
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:09,046
I've had a little accident,
as you can see...

207
00:24:09,085 --> 00:24:10,814
ended up in this chair.

208
00:24:10,853 --> 00:24:14,846
Accident, my ass.
You said this was straight talk.

209
00:24:14,891 --> 00:24:18,987
So he took a jump. He wasn't
sticking needles in his arms.

210
00:24:19,028 --> 00:24:23,556
Save it, Kincaid. Jennifer?

211
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,499
I'm Jennifer Callfield...

212
00:24:25,535 --> 00:24:27,765
and as soon as
I get out of here...

213
00:24:27,804 --> 00:24:30,534
I'm going to Los Angeles
to be an actress.

214
00:24:30,573 --> 00:24:32,768
I'm going to be on TV.

215
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:35,710
Yeah. "Lifestyle
of the Rich and Psychotic."

216
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:37,042
Screw you.

217
00:24:39,849 --> 00:24:42,477
This is Joey. He used to be
a debater in school.

218
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:45,282
Now he doesn't talk much.

219
00:24:46,356 --> 00:24:47,846
I'm Taryn White.

220
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,858
The only reason I'm in here...

221
00:24:49,892 --> 00:24:52,588
is because
it's better than juvie hall.

222
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:55,825
Also because I'm going through
some very strange shit.

223
00:24:55,865 --> 00:24:57,662
Your dreams?

224
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,328
Everybody has bad dreams.

225
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:02,861
Can I interject something
just to save time?

226
00:25:02,905 --> 00:25:04,736
Sure, Phillip, go ahead.

227
00:25:04,774 --> 00:25:06,674
According to our kind hosts...

228
00:25:06,709 --> 00:25:09,109
our dreams
are a group psychosis...

229
00:25:09,145 --> 00:25:11,705
sort of a mellow mass hysteria.

230
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:13,443
The fact that
we all dreamt about this guy...

231
00:25:13,483 --> 00:25:16,213
before we ever met
doesn't impress anybody.

232
00:25:17,754 --> 00:25:19,244
So we go in circles...

233
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:22,086
making minimal progress
with maximum effort.

234
00:25:22,125 --> 00:25:23,490
You won't make any progress...

235
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:26,495
until you recognize your dreams
for what they are.

236
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:28,258
And what are they?

237
00:25:28,297 --> 00:25:30,527
The by-products of guilt.

238
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:34,502
Psychological scars
stemming from moral conflicts...

239
00:25:34,537 --> 00:25:36,232
and overt sexuality.

240
00:25:36,272 --> 00:25:39,036
Oh, great.
It's my dick that's killing me.

241
00:25:45,048 --> 00:25:48,108
Tell me what's supposed
to be happening again.

242
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:51,211
You're being attacked
by the bog demon.

243
00:25:52,522 --> 00:25:53,989
Fourteen.

244
00:25:54,023 --> 00:25:55,581
Doesn't count.
You got to say the words.

245
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:59,083
- This is stupid.
- Come on.

246
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:06,932
In the name of Lowrek,
Prince of Elves, demon begone.

247
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,964
Good.
You conquered the demon...

248
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:12,531
but your horse
is sinking in the bog.

249
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:14,304
What do you do?

250
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:19,707
I go to bed, and get a new horse
in the morning.

251
00:26:21,584 --> 00:26:24,417
How do I score that...
enchanted slumber or death?

252
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:28,752
All right, fellas. Lights out.

253
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:30,418
Aw, Max.

254
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,428
"Aw, Max." You know the rules.

255
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:34,487
Come on, Joey. You, too.

256
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:36,930
Every time
we get a good game going...

257
00:26:36,966 --> 00:26:38,490
it's always, "Lights out."

258
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:52,471
- Good night, fellas.
- Night, Max.

259
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:58,243
OK, you get first shift.

260
00:26:59,322 --> 00:27:01,085
Oh, come on.
I had it last night.

261
00:27:02,592 --> 00:27:05,561
Good. Just remember,
keep your eyes open...

262
00:27:05,595 --> 00:27:09,326
and one whimper,
and you wake me up, OK?

263
00:27:23,779 --> 00:27:26,873
- This is nice.
- You never been here before?

264
00:27:26,916 --> 00:27:30,408
No. I think it opened
when I was at school.

265
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:32,683
Best Thai food in Springwood.

266
00:27:32,722 --> 00:27:35,953
Of course, it's the only
Thai food in Springwood.

267
00:27:35,992 --> 00:27:38,460
Do your parents
still live around here?

268
00:27:40,229 --> 00:27:41,958
My mother passed away.

269
00:27:41,998 --> 00:27:44,523
She died in her sleep.

270
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:46,091
I'm sorry.

271
00:27:47,003 --> 00:27:49,699
My father and I...

272
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,175
Things just seemed
to fall apart after that.

273
00:27:53,209 --> 00:27:55,677
Sounds like a rough time.

274
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:57,042
It was.

275
00:28:00,183 --> 00:28:04,210
What if I told you that...

276
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:07,620
your patients
are in real physical danger...

277
00:28:07,657 --> 00:28:09,488
from their dreams?

278
00:28:09,525 --> 00:28:14,155
The nightmares are nothing but
a symptom of the real problems.

279
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:18,429
Then let's just eliminate
the symptom for the time being.

280
00:28:18,467 --> 00:28:20,264
With Hypnocil?

281
00:28:21,704 --> 00:28:22,932
That's right.

282
00:28:22,972 --> 00:28:24,837
You want me to prescribe...

283
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:26,739
an experimental
psychoactive drug...

284
00:28:26,776 --> 00:28:28,710
to a bunch
of suicidal teenagers?

285
00:28:28,744 --> 00:28:30,939
Just until we get things
under control.

286
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:34,074
Dream deprivation is
nothing to fool with.

287
00:28:34,116 --> 00:28:36,277
You have no business
taking it yourself.

288
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,946
I used to be like them.

289
00:28:37,987 --> 00:28:40,012
I know what
they're going through.

290
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:41,421
So do I.

291
00:28:41,457 --> 00:28:46,394
You told me they were survivors,
and they are.

292
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:49,660
But how much longer
they survive is up to us.

293
00:28:51,601 --> 00:28:53,501
I'm sorry, Nancy.

294
00:28:53,536 --> 00:28:55,834
The answer's no.

295
00:30:18,387 --> 00:30:19,581
Phillip, wake up.

296
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:26,557
Have a nice stroll, asshole.

297
00:31:13,743 --> 00:31:16,234
What? What are you doing?

298
00:31:16,278 --> 00:31:17,768
Hey! Come on, man!

299
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:19,508
What are you, crazy?

300
00:31:22,284 --> 00:31:24,184
Oh, shit! What's he doing?

301
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,382
Get help! Get help!

302
00:31:41,971 --> 00:31:43,700
What's the matter?

303
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:51,307
Don't do it, Phillip!

304
00:31:59,688 --> 00:32:01,212
God! Stop!

305
00:32:33,622 --> 00:32:36,056
I want us to talk
about last night.

306
00:32:36,091 --> 00:32:39,254
I want us to get our feelings
out in the open.

307
00:32:40,996 --> 00:32:44,329
He wasn't strong enough,
so he got wasted. That's all.

308
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:47,062
That's all?
Is that what you think?

309
00:32:47,102 --> 00:32:49,764
He couldn't hack it,
so he got nailed. Period.

310
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:54,174
Yeah. Big, tough badass.
How long will you last?

311
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,973
Longer than any of you.

312
00:32:56,011 --> 00:32:58,980
Go ahead and fight.
That's what he wants.

313
00:32:59,014 --> 00:32:59,981
Who?

314
00:33:00,015 --> 00:33:02,347
Who do you think?
What does he want?

315
00:33:02,384 --> 00:33:06,081
To turn us against each other
so we'll be weak.

316
00:33:06,121 --> 00:33:08,055
- Horseshit.
- No, she's right.

317
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:10,718
We're all
missing the point here.

318
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:13,284
Phillip's death
was a sleepwalking accident.

319
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:14,489
Nothing more.

320
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,297
No. I could see him
up there... his face.

321
00:33:19,335 --> 00:33:23,601
He was wide awake...
all the way down.

322
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:27,302
Then it was suicide.
Phillip quit. He gave up.

323
00:33:27,343 --> 00:33:28,640
Joey says it wasn't suicide.

324
00:33:28,677 --> 00:33:31,510
Listen to me, Joey.
Phillip killed himself.

325
00:33:31,547 --> 00:33:34,277
That's a cowardly thing.
That's an empty thing.

326
00:33:34,316 --> 00:33:36,546
He let himself down.
He let all of us down.

327
00:33:36,585 --> 00:33:39,577
It was murder!
Can't you understand that?

328
00:33:39,622 --> 00:33:41,988
That bastard murdered him!

329
00:33:42,024 --> 00:33:44,185
I'm not listening to this.

330
00:33:44,226 --> 00:33:46,990
How much longer will you go on
blaming your dreams...

331
00:33:47,029 --> 00:33:48,724
for your own weaknesses?

332
00:33:48,764 --> 00:33:52,632
How much longer will you keep
blowing smoke up our ass?

333
00:33:52,668 --> 00:33:54,693
There will be
no repeat occurrences...

334
00:33:54,737 --> 00:33:56,398
of last night's events.

335
00:33:56,438 --> 00:34:00,169
Your doors will be locked
during sleeping hours.

336
00:34:00,209 --> 00:34:03,269
We'll start a policy
of evening sedation.

337
00:34:03,312 --> 00:34:06,839
Anybody tries drugs on me
will get his ass kicked!

338
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:09,749
You just bought yourself
a night in the quiet room!

339
00:34:09,785 --> 00:34:12,219
- Sit down!
- Fuck you! You sit down!

340
00:34:12,254 --> 00:34:13,448
Easy, Kincaid.

341
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:17,619
Nobody's putting me to sleep!
Get away! Let me alone!

342
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:20,151
Ain't nobody
putting me to sleep!

343
00:34:20,195 --> 00:34:22,925
I don't want to go to sleep!

344
00:34:22,965 --> 00:34:24,694
I ain't going to sleep!

345
00:34:24,733 --> 00:34:26,200
Stay in your seats.

346
00:34:27,403 --> 00:34:29,735
We'll begin sedation tonight,
starting with him.

347
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:32,741
You can't.
They'll be defenseless.

348
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:34,766
That's precisely
what they need...

349
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:37,904
some uninterrupted REM sleep
to release that negative energy.

350
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm prescribing Hypnocil.

351
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:42,011
It's a dream suppressant.

352
00:34:42,051 --> 00:34:45,919
I know what it is.
I just can't believe it.

353
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:47,252
What has she talked you into?

354
00:34:47,289 --> 00:34:49,621
Nothing. It's my decision.

355
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:52,650
I want these dreams stopped
till we get some answers.

356
00:34:52,695 --> 00:34:55,186
I can't allow that.

357
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,993
Then I'll go to Carver
if I have to.

358
00:34:57,032 --> 00:34:59,830
He'll either back me up
or accept my resignation.

359
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:04,037
All right.
But if something goes wrong...

360
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:06,132
I'll make sure
that you're held responsible.

361
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:08,871
I mean that.
Fully responsible.

362
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,111
I can't believe
I just said that.

363
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:16,140
Can we get
the Hypnocil by tomorrow?

364
00:35:16,185 --> 00:35:18,016
We're going to try.

365
00:35:18,721 --> 00:35:23,021
I hope you know
what you're getting us into.

366
00:35:29,598 --> 00:35:35,298
Ain't gonna dream no more,
no more

367
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:40,297
Ain't gonna dream no more

368
00:35:40,342 --> 00:35:45,837
All night long, I sing this song

369
00:35:45,881 --> 00:35:49,408
Ain't gonna dream no more

370
00:35:57,893 --> 00:35:59,360
Girl, what are you doing?

371
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:01,829
- Watching TV.
- I can see that.

372
00:36:01,864 --> 00:36:05,163
Why don't you read a book?
You watch too much damn TV.

373
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,326
Research.

374
00:36:06,368 --> 00:36:09,667
Right.
You're going to be a TV star.

375
00:36:09,705 --> 00:36:11,297
Wait and see.

376
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,808
If Simms catches you here
after lights out...

377
00:36:13,842 --> 00:36:15,776
she's gonna chew my ass.

378
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:17,210
I gotta stay up, Max.

379
00:36:18,547 --> 00:36:20,276
Just tonight, please?

380
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:22,715
I can't handle the nightmare.

381
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:27,054
Not after Phillip. Not tonight.

382
00:36:34,963 --> 00:36:36,487
I never saw you.

383
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:38,523
Thanks, Max.

384
00:36:59,521 --> 00:37:01,887
Hi, sweet stuff. Good news.

385
00:37:01,924 --> 00:37:03,755
Can't be good news,
coming from you.

386
00:37:03,792 --> 00:37:06,693
- Pulled night duty.
- So?

387
00:37:06,729 --> 00:37:10,495
So, got the keys to heaven,
baby.

388
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:13,160
- What?
- The dispensary.

389
00:37:13,202 --> 00:37:16,569
I am talking
clean pharmaceutical high...

390
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:18,436
a night at Club Meth.

391
00:37:18,474 --> 00:37:20,408
I don't do that shit.

392
00:37:20,442 --> 00:37:23,070
Yeah?
What are those, beauty marks?

393
00:37:23,112 --> 00:37:26,741
- Those are ancient history.
- Oh, yeah?

394
00:37:26,782 --> 00:37:29,444
If you're ever in the mood
for a history lesson...

395
00:37:29,485 --> 00:37:31,715
I'm your teacher, understand?

396
00:37:31,754 --> 00:37:36,714
Stay out of my face,
or I'll go straight to Max.

397
00:37:36,759 --> 00:37:40,217
Who's going to take the word
of a crazy junkie chick?

398
00:37:40,262 --> 00:37:41,627
Fuck off!

399
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:36,050
It's silly to ask, but how many
of what did they kill?

400
00:38:36,084 --> 00:38:39,850
Don't say that. I love animals.

401
00:38:39,888 --> 00:38:43,016
I bought it red,
so I didn't know what it was.

402
00:38:43,058 --> 00:38:44,821
Probably an artificial bird.

403
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,623
Ever go to acting school?

404
00:38:46,662 --> 00:38:50,496
Not in the beginning.
I started on a talk show.

405
00:38:50,532 --> 00:38:53,729
So you don't always say
you have to study?

406
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:57,227
I think you should
study, work...

407
00:38:57,272 --> 00:39:00,298
then maybe you can make it.

408
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:02,537
- Can I ask you something?
- Certainly.

409
00:39:02,578 --> 00:39:05,069
Who gives a fuck what you think?

410
00:39:19,294 --> 00:39:24,095
One, two,
Freddy's coming for you

411
00:39:24,132 --> 00:39:28,967
Three, four,
better lock the door

412
00:39:49,057 --> 00:39:53,960
This is it, Jennifer...
your big break in TV.

413
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:56,863
Welcome to prime time, bitch!

414
00:40:22,824 --> 00:40:26,089
Don't be ashamed, young man.

415
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:28,426
This is a place for sorrow.

416
00:40:29,431 --> 00:40:31,365
What faith do you follow?

417
00:40:34,136 --> 00:40:35,569
Science, I suppose.

418
00:40:36,872 --> 00:40:38,362
Sad choice.

419
00:40:38,407 --> 00:40:41,774
There are times when it doesn't
offer much comfort.

420
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:49,775
I've seen you before, Sister...

421
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:51,718
Mary Helena.

422
00:40:53,255 --> 00:40:56,713
You do volunteer work
at the hospital.

423
00:40:56,758 --> 00:41:00,353
From time to time,
when I'm needed.

424
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,897
I should have been able
to save them.

425
00:41:07,936 --> 00:41:10,336
Only one thing
can save the children.

426
00:41:10,372 --> 00:41:15,503
The unquiet spirit
must be laid to rest.

427
00:41:15,544 --> 00:41:20,811
It is an abomination
to God and to man.

428
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:29,250
Excuse me, sister.

429
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:33,652
What are you doing up here?

430
00:41:33,695 --> 00:41:34,957
I was talking to...

431
00:41:36,698 --> 00:41:38,359
To who?

432
00:41:39,768 --> 00:41:41,702
Doesn't matter.

433
00:41:41,737 --> 00:41:43,705
Are you ready to go now?

434
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:44,933
Sure.

435
00:41:55,784 --> 00:41:57,308
Are you finished?

436
00:41:57,352 --> 00:42:01,049
Yeah. I'm sorry.
I guess I'm not hungry.

437
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,317
That's OK.

438
00:42:07,396 --> 00:42:09,887
That's pretty. What is that?

439
00:42:13,335 --> 00:42:15,895
This is my Malaysian dream doll.

440
00:42:15,937 --> 00:42:19,031
It's supposed to bring
good dreams.

441
00:42:20,008 --> 00:42:22,943
I could use some of that
right about now.

442
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:32,720
You know, I used to think...

443
00:42:32,754 --> 00:42:34,483
I could do something
for the kids...

444
00:42:34,523 --> 00:42:36,548
make some kind of difference...

445
00:42:36,591 --> 00:42:39,492
but they're slipping through
my fingers, every one.

446
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:43,260
You're doing the best
you can for them, Neil.

447
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,426
Am I?

448
00:42:46,468 --> 00:42:49,631
I'm running out of answers.

449
00:42:49,671 --> 00:42:52,868
A patient sleepwalks
out of a high-security ward.

450
00:42:52,908 --> 00:42:54,432
A girl alone in a room dies.

451
00:42:54,476 --> 00:42:57,001
I can't believe
this is happening.

452
00:42:58,346 --> 00:43:00,075
Nothing makes any sense.

453
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:05,619
Then maybe you're ready.

454
00:43:06,988 --> 00:43:08,956
For what?

455
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,423
The truth.

456
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,291
Try me.

457
00:43:13,495 --> 00:43:15,463
Only if you're willing
to put aside...

458
00:43:15,497 --> 00:43:17,795
everything you've learned
and trust me.

459
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,661
Can you do that?

460
00:43:22,871 --> 00:43:24,395
I can do that.

461
00:43:29,344 --> 00:43:31,744
Straight talk only in this room.

462
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,510
- Is this group?
- Yeah, unofficially.

463
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:38,383
Soon there won't be enough
of us left to call it group.

464
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,322
Listen up, you guys.
Nancy has something to say.

465
00:43:43,425 --> 00:43:45,825
I know who's trying to kill you.

466
00:43:45,861 --> 00:43:48,830
Don't humor us.
We're not in the mood.

467
00:43:48,864 --> 00:43:52,994
He wears a dirty brown hat.

468
00:43:53,034 --> 00:43:55,025
He's horribly burned.

469
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:59,531
He has razors on his right hand.

470
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,338
Who is he?

471
00:44:04,613 --> 00:44:07,047
His name is Freddy Krueger.

472
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:11,408
He was a child murderer
before he died.

473
00:44:11,453 --> 00:44:14,479
And after he died...

474
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:16,354
he became something worse.

475
00:44:16,992 --> 00:44:21,793
Six years ago,
he killed my friends.

476
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:23,593
He almost killed me.

477
00:44:23,632 --> 00:44:25,361
Why is he after us?

478
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:27,698
Yeah. What did we do?

479
00:44:27,736 --> 00:44:29,829
It's not you.

480
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:34,570
Your parents, my parents...
they burned him alive.

481
00:44:34,609 --> 00:44:37,601
And now we're paying
for their sins.

482
00:44:39,014 --> 00:44:42,745
You are the last
of the Elm Street children.

483
00:44:43,952 --> 00:44:46,887
Mom and Dad...
I mean, that's crazy.

484
00:44:46,922 --> 00:44:48,480
They never mentioned anything...

485
00:44:48,523 --> 00:44:51,356
Sure. Parents tell
their kids that sort of thing...

486
00:44:51,393 --> 00:44:53,361
"Good night. Say your prayers.

487
00:44:53,395 --> 00:44:56,421
"By the way, we torched
some maniac last night."

488
00:44:56,464 --> 00:44:58,762
So what do we do
about this creep?

489
00:44:59,201 --> 00:45:01,431
Kristen is the key.

490
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:05,701
She has a very special talent.
A gift.

491
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,538
I haven't been able to do that
since I was little.

492
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:12,069
- You did it the other night.
- That was different.

493
00:45:12,113 --> 00:45:17,141
You never lose a gift like that.
You just forget how to use it.

494
00:45:17,185 --> 00:45:19,016
How about it? Will you try?

495
00:45:21,122 --> 00:45:24,091
All of you have
this inner strength...

496
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:27,026
some special power
that you've had...

497
00:45:27,062 --> 00:45:29,087
in your most wonderful dreams.

498
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,362
Together, we can learn
to use that power if we try.

499
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:34,663
You sound like Peter Pan.

500
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:37,766
Remember, open mind?

501
00:45:39,674 --> 00:45:43,542
Taryn,
would you pull the shades down?

502
00:45:43,578 --> 00:45:46,945
We're going to try
a little group hypnosis.

503
00:45:57,692 --> 00:46:03,995
I want you all to follow
this pendulum with your eyes.

504
00:46:04,032 --> 00:46:05,761
Tune out everything else.

505
00:46:06,768 --> 00:46:09,703
Nothing else exists
but the pendulum.

506
00:46:09,738 --> 00:46:11,865
Take us there, Kristen.

507
00:46:12,874 --> 00:46:15,934
Breathe deeply and relax.

508
00:46:17,145 --> 00:46:19,705
Starting with your toes,
relax everything...

509
00:46:19,748 --> 00:46:22,308
till there's no tension
left in your bodies.

510
00:46:24,386 --> 00:46:25,944
Keep following the pendulum.

511
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:30,516
You find yourselves
getting tired.

512
00:46:32,294 --> 00:46:34,956
Nothing would feel better
right now...

513
00:46:34,996 --> 00:46:40,332
than a nice, long, deep sleep.

514
00:46:41,803 --> 00:46:44,363
I'm going to count backwards
from five.

515
00:46:44,406 --> 00:46:46,931
When I finish...

516
00:46:46,975 --> 00:46:51,139
you will all be asleep.

517
00:46:52,180 --> 00:46:53,943
Five...

518
00:46:53,982 --> 00:46:55,711
four...

519
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:57,411
three...

520
00:46:57,452 --> 00:46:59,477
two...

521
00:46:59,521 --> 00:47:00,783
one.

522
00:47:13,735 --> 00:47:15,100
Sorry.

523
00:47:15,136 --> 00:47:17,661
That's OK. We'll try again.

524
00:47:17,706 --> 00:47:19,571
Everybody take five.

525
00:47:26,448 --> 00:47:27,847
I was willing
to go through with this...

526
00:47:27,882 --> 00:47:33,184
for the kids' peace of mind,
but you'll have to face reality.

527
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:11,124
Joey, I just wanted to get you
alone for a second.

528
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:15,027
I mean, look, I really like you.

529
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:17,955
Do you like me?

530
00:48:17,999 --> 00:48:19,466
I know this sounds crazy...

531
00:48:19,501 --> 00:48:22,800
but I make up excuses to come
into the ward every day...

532
00:48:22,837 --> 00:48:24,828
just to see you.

533
00:48:24,873 --> 00:48:26,807
You're so cute.

534
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:32,745
Let's just try one more time.

535
00:48:32,781 --> 00:48:35,909
If it doesn't work,
I promise I'll...

536
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:43,617
We're here.

537
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:48,153
- Where here?
- We're in the dream.

538
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:51,688
No, we're not.
We're still here in the group.

539
00:48:55,103 --> 00:48:58,197
In my dreams, I can walk.

540
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,434
My legs are strong.

541
00:49:00,475 --> 00:49:03,535
In my dreams,
I am the Wizard Master.

542
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:15,312
Try something, Kristen.
What can you do in your dream?

543
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:31,732
A perfect score.
The crowd goes wild.

544
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:35,168
Dig this.

545
00:49:40,682 --> 00:49:42,775
Kincaid, please.

546
00:49:43,818 --> 00:49:45,285
That's very unnerving.

547
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,151
Hey, check out Taryn.

548
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:49,418
In my dreams, I'm beautiful...

549
00:49:51,092 --> 00:49:53,822
and bad.

550
00:49:53,862 --> 00:49:57,628
I could get into
a lot of trouble for this.

551
00:49:59,567 --> 00:50:03,059
But I know you won't
say anything, will you?

552
00:50:04,305 --> 00:50:06,432
Unzip me.

553
00:50:20,321 --> 00:50:22,789
Do you like my body, Joey?

554
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:16,173
What's wrong, Joey?
Feeling tongue-tied?

555
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:52,512
What's happening?

556
00:51:52,547 --> 00:51:54,447
- He's close.
- Who, Freddy?

557
00:51:54,482 --> 00:51:55,642
He's heavy in the halls.

558
00:51:55,683 --> 00:51:57,617
- Where's Joey?
- Freddy's got him.

559
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:04,087
Quiet, everyone! Listen.

560
00:52:11,566 --> 00:52:12,555
The room's changing.

561
00:52:14,068 --> 00:52:15,933
What the heck's going on here?

562
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:17,198
What's happening?

563
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:23,603
Get away from the wall.

564
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:29,881
Help!

565
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:45,765
Don't panic! Quiet down!

566
00:52:50,905 --> 00:52:53,499
This isn't real!

567
00:52:54,142 --> 00:52:55,302
Get us out!

568
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,737
Quiet! The door!

569
00:52:59,714 --> 00:53:02,114
What's going on in here?

570
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:05,119
What's wrong with Joey?

571
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:09,486
Code blue.

572
00:53:09,524 --> 00:53:10,821
Oh, my God.

573
00:53:18,332 --> 00:53:21,392
He's in a deep coma.
There's nothing we can do.

574
00:53:21,436 --> 00:53:23,700
This is inexcusable.

575
00:53:23,738 --> 00:53:25,569
The session was unauthorized.

576
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:27,699
It was purposely conducted
without my knowledge.

577
00:53:27,742 --> 00:53:30,575
Unusual steps were called for.

578
00:53:30,611 --> 00:53:32,909
Is that what I should
tell his parents?

579
00:53:32,947 --> 00:53:35,814
I understand you prescribed
a highly experimental drug.

580
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:37,545
He's not in a coma...

581
00:53:37,585 --> 00:53:40,179
Your opinion
is of no interest to me.

582
00:53:40,221 --> 00:53:44,317
Furthermore, you've created
panic among the patients.

583
00:53:44,358 --> 00:53:46,258
That's not true.

584
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:49,752
In four days,
we've had two suicides.

585
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:51,287
Now he's in a coma.

586
00:53:51,332 --> 00:53:54,768
It's safe to say your approach
has failed, entirely.

587
00:53:54,802 --> 00:53:58,135
You're both relieved of duty.
I want you out today.

588
00:54:01,442 --> 00:54:03,239
I'm sorry, Neil.

589
00:54:03,277 --> 00:54:05,939
I'm afraid
you brought it on yourself.

590
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:07,447
For God's sake, Elizabeth...

591
00:54:07,482 --> 00:54:10,451
will you please just try
to help the kids?

592
00:54:10,485 --> 00:54:12,510
Will you listen to them?

593
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:14,350
Of course I will.

594
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,928
What are we going to do?

595
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:24,431
There's nothing that we can do.

596
00:54:24,465 --> 00:54:26,456
It's out of our hands.

597
00:55:06,073 --> 00:55:07,472
Sister!

598
00:56:49,310 --> 00:56:52,211
This is where it began.

599
00:56:52,246 --> 00:56:55,477
This wing's been closed
for years.

600
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:57,746
What was this place?

601
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:02,245
Purgatory... fashioned
by the hands of men.

602
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:06,715
Twisted, lonely souls.

603
00:57:06,761 --> 00:57:09,821
The worst
of the criminally insane...

604
00:57:10,965 --> 00:57:14,731
were locked up in here
like animals.

605
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:18,466
This whole facility
was shut down in the forties.

606
00:57:18,506 --> 00:57:20,406
Some sort of scandal?

607
00:57:21,742 --> 00:57:24,210
A young girl on the staff...

608
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:28,841
was accidentally locked in here
over the holidays.

609
00:57:28,883 --> 00:57:33,217
The inmates
kept her hidden for days.

610
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:37,623
She was raped...
hundreds of times.

611
00:57:38,826 --> 00:57:42,785
When they found her,
she was barely alive...

612
00:57:42,830 --> 00:57:45,799
and with child.

613
00:57:45,833 --> 00:57:49,030
That girl was Amanda Krueger.

614
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,662
Her child...

615
00:57:51,939 --> 00:57:57,536
The bastard son
of a hundred maniacs.

616
00:57:57,578 --> 00:58:01,036
Some say he was murdered...

617
00:58:01,082 --> 00:58:03,175
though no body was ever found.

618
00:58:05,453 --> 00:58:11,414
You said something before
about laying him to rest.

619
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:14,917
You must find the remains...

620
00:58:14,962 --> 00:58:18,454
and bury him in hallowed ground.

621
00:58:25,306 --> 00:58:27,501
Hallowed ground?

622
00:58:27,541 --> 00:58:29,065
Sister?

623
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:36,039
If your only faith is science,
Doctor...

624
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:40,577
it may be you
that's laid to rest.

625
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:45,050
Wait!

626
00:58:45,092 --> 00:58:46,684
Sister!

627
00:59:05,813 --> 00:59:07,940
Let go of him, you bastard.

628
00:59:12,787 --> 00:59:13,947
Oh, my God.

629
00:59:26,067 --> 00:59:28,399
I've got to go in.
We have no choice.

630
00:59:28,436 --> 00:59:31,428
Getting yourself killed
won't help the kids at all.

631
00:59:33,307 --> 00:59:35,332
Besides, we do have a choice.

632
00:59:36,510 --> 00:59:38,637
Assuming your mysterious nun
is right.

633
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,944
I've heard weirder things
this week.

634
00:59:43,517 --> 00:59:45,815
All right. Whoever she is...

635
00:59:45,853 --> 00:59:48,788
she seems to know
more about Krueger than I do.

636
00:59:48,823 --> 00:59:51,917
The question is,
what happened to his body?

637
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,220
They burned him to death
in his boiler room...

638
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:58,026
and they hid the remains.

639
00:59:58,065 --> 00:59:59,532
Who would know
where they're hidden?

640
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:02,593
Only one man knows...

641
01:00:04,171 --> 01:00:06,935
and it's time for him to talk.

642
01:00:11,145 --> 01:00:13,739
You can't take Nancy
away from us!

643
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:15,146
She's all we have!

644
01:00:15,182 --> 01:00:17,150
You're a sick girl, Kristen.

645
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:19,379
If you want to get better,
you must trust me now.

646
01:00:27,061 --> 01:00:29,325
Take her to the quiet room
and sedate her.

647
01:00:30,698 --> 01:00:33,997
You stupid bitch!
You're killing us!

648
01:00:41,909 --> 01:00:44,036
All right, everybody.
Back to bed.

649
01:01:02,830 --> 01:01:03,990
Hi, Daddy.

650
01:01:08,669 --> 01:01:11,263
Well, if it isn't
my little girl.

651
01:01:14,108 --> 01:01:16,133
My baby come to see her daddy?

652
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:19,741
It's been a long time.

653
01:01:21,115 --> 01:01:23,106
But you're here. Sit down.

654
01:01:24,451 --> 01:01:27,614
What did I do to get so lucky?

655
01:01:28,355 --> 01:01:31,415
I thought that you were
trying to forget me.

656
01:01:31,992 --> 01:01:35,018
That's not true.
You're the one trying to forget.

657
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:42,591
I need your help, Dad.
Krueger's back.

658
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:51,109
Fred Krueger is dead.

659
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:54,444
You always had a little trouble
trying to understand that.

660
01:01:54,481 --> 01:01:55,948
You know what he did.

661
01:01:58,152 --> 01:01:59,619
He's doing it again.

662
01:02:01,388 --> 01:02:02,821
She's telling you the truth.

663
01:02:03,624 --> 01:02:04,818
I don't believe we've met...

664
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:07,588
and this isn't
any of your goddamn business.

665
01:02:07,628 --> 01:02:12,725
We can stop him this time...
stop him for good...

666
01:02:12,766 --> 01:02:15,826
but we need to know
where his bones were hidden.

667
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:22,641
I've lost too much
over this already.

668
01:02:22,676 --> 01:02:24,143
I'm through with it.

669
01:02:24,178 --> 01:02:27,375
People are still dying
after all this time.

670
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:29,541
Stop running away from it.

671
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:34,078
You owe me.

672
01:02:35,022 --> 01:02:36,922
It was nice seeing you again,
princess.

673
01:02:36,957 --> 01:02:39,448
Next time, don't...

674
01:02:39,493 --> 01:02:41,358
don't stay away so long.

675
01:02:50,537 --> 01:02:53,506
I'll be OK.
Just give me a minute.

676
01:02:57,278 --> 01:02:58,438
It's the hospital.

677
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,958
- Dr. Gordon?
- Taryn.

678
01:03:11,992 --> 01:03:14,961
You've got to come right away.
Kristen had a total shit attack.

679
01:03:14,995 --> 01:03:17,691
Simms doped her up
and put her in the quiet room.

680
01:03:17,731 --> 01:03:20,894
Simms put Kristen
in the quiet room for the night.

681
01:03:20,934 --> 01:03:23,300
- They sedated her.
- Oh, no.

682
01:03:23,337 --> 01:03:26,306
She can't stay awake for long.
She's all alone.

683
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:28,808
Freddy's going to get her.

684
01:03:28,842 --> 01:03:31,606
Just stay cool.
Help is on the way.

685
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:32,805
Just hurry!

686
01:03:32,846 --> 01:03:34,313
I got to get there.

687
01:03:34,348 --> 01:03:37,317
- You go. I'll get the remains.
- It's no use.

688
01:03:37,351 --> 01:03:39,979
I'll talk to him.
Make Simms understand.

689
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,147
She'll never understand.
I got to get to Kristen.

690
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:44,655
Be careful.

691
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:03,098
My name is Neil Gordon.
Pleased to meet you.

692
01:04:03,143 --> 01:04:04,974
There, now we've met!

693
01:04:05,012 --> 01:04:06,673
Now listen to me!

694
01:04:06,714 --> 01:04:10,775
Maybe you don't care whether
Nancy lives or dies, but I do!

695
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:15,755
You and I are going
on a little scavenger hunt.

696
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:35,241
Please, God...

697
01:04:36,744 --> 01:04:38,609
don't make me sleep.

698
01:04:49,823 --> 01:04:51,484
What the hell are we doing here?

699
01:04:56,196 --> 01:04:57,686
I won't be long.

700
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:50,347
What do you think you're doing?

701
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:53,444
Look, I'm sorry.

702
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:56,945
I really need this. I got...

703
01:05:56,990 --> 01:05:59,424
I'll reimburse you.

704
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:02,327
You keep my driver's license.
I'll be back.

705
01:06:16,743 --> 01:06:19,234
Max, I need to see Kristen.

706
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:23,374
- You don't understand.
- Save your breath.

707
01:06:23,417 --> 01:06:25,317
Dr. Simms
gave me specific instructions.

708
01:06:25,352 --> 01:06:27,752
No one sees Kristen,
especially you.

709
01:06:27,788 --> 01:06:30,655
But, Max, she needs me.
She's in danger.

710
01:06:30,691 --> 01:06:32,283
You got to believe me!

711
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:36,353
I really think you mean well,
but my kids been dying off...

712
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:40,893
and even without Simms' orders,
I wouldn't let you near her.

713
01:06:44,538 --> 01:06:47,029
OK, Max. I understand.

714
01:06:47,074 --> 01:06:49,440
Can I say good-bye
to the others?

715
01:06:49,476 --> 01:06:50,670
I don't know.

716
01:06:50,711 --> 01:06:53,509
It'll be my last chance.

717
01:06:54,815 --> 01:06:57,750
Five minutes.
They're in the TV room.

718
01:07:02,823 --> 01:07:04,290
Where have you been?

719
01:07:04,324 --> 01:07:06,292
There's no time. Come on.

720
01:07:06,326 --> 01:07:08,692
- Where?
- Our last group.

721
01:07:23,644 --> 01:07:24,804
In there.

722
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,276
We knew nobody would ever
find it in that place.

723
01:07:31,718 --> 01:07:33,913
I'm not sure
I can find it myself anymore.

724
01:08:04,851 --> 01:08:07,820
It's deep in the heart
of the place.

725
01:08:07,854 --> 01:08:09,515
Take it slow.

726
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:28,034
Straight talk only in here.

727
01:08:29,076 --> 01:08:30,543
What about Kristen?

728
01:08:30,577 --> 01:08:32,511
We can't get to her. I tried.

729
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:37,176
I was hoping we'd have more time
to learn to use the dreams...

730
01:08:37,985 --> 01:08:41,546
but Joey's in there.
Kristen's going in, too.

731
01:08:41,588 --> 01:08:43,249
They need us.

732
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:46,521
We're trying to go in,
to link up?

733
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,050
It's now or never.

734
01:08:48,095 --> 01:08:51,030
I'm not going to kid you.
This is dangerous.

735
01:08:51,064 --> 01:08:53,589
If you die in this dream,
it's for real.

736
01:08:53,634 --> 01:08:56,296
Nobody has to go in
that doesn't want to.

737
01:09:00,073 --> 01:09:01,700
I'm in.

738
01:09:01,742 --> 01:09:04,802
Me, too.

739
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:09,214
Let's go kick the motherfucker's
ass all over dreamland.

740
01:09:10,617 --> 01:09:14,314
Remember, you have to stay
together whatever happens.

741
01:09:14,354 --> 01:09:16,322
That's the only way
we can beat him.

742
01:09:22,696 --> 01:09:25,688
All right.
Clear your mind of everything.

743
01:09:30,704 --> 01:09:33,502
Picture yourself
in the quiet room...

744
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,338
the soft, white walls...

745
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:38,640
the total silence...

746
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:41,546
only the sound
of your heart beating.

747
01:09:41,581 --> 01:09:44,709
Picture yourself there
with Kristen.

748
01:09:44,751 --> 01:09:48,312
I'm going to count backwards
from five...

749
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:51,415
and when I'm done,
we'll all be asleep.

750
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:54,450
We'll all be in the quiet room.

751
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:57,990
Five...

752
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:01,592
four...

753
01:10:04,471 --> 01:10:05,631
three...

754
01:10:08,508 --> 01:10:09,668
two...

755
01:10:12,012 --> 01:10:13,172
one.

756
01:10:18,018 --> 01:10:19,485
I knew you'd come.

757
01:10:19,519 --> 01:10:21,419
We wouldn't let you go in alone.

758
01:10:21,455 --> 01:10:24,481
No way. We're a team!

759
01:10:24,524 --> 01:10:28,483
Listen, everybody.
Joey needs us. I can feel him.

760
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:30,120
Where is he?

761
01:10:30,897 --> 01:10:32,364
How do we find him?

762
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:43,236
Stay in the middle of the room!

763
01:10:46,113 --> 01:10:47,444
Whatever happens, stay together!

764
01:11:04,898 --> 01:11:07,731
You'll wake up
the whole neighborhood.

765
01:11:08,902 --> 01:11:11,894
Why are you still up?
It's past 1:00.

766
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,872
I just thought I'd wait for you.

767
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:20,243
Well, I'm home.

768
01:11:20,280 --> 01:11:21,770
You can get to sleep now.
Come on.

769
01:11:21,815 --> 01:11:22,907
Andale.

770
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,057
What's that for?

771
01:11:32,092 --> 01:11:34,083
I'm just glad you're home.

772
01:11:40,367 --> 01:11:43,393
Mom, I had the most awful dream.

773
01:11:43,436 --> 01:11:46,405
Elaine,
where do you keep the bourbon?

774
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:47,929
I'll be right down.

775
01:11:49,209 --> 01:11:51,177
Kris, I've got a guest.

776
01:11:51,211 --> 01:11:53,702
I just don't want to be alone.

777
01:11:55,949 --> 01:11:59,578
I said
where's the fucking bourbon?

778
01:12:01,855 --> 01:12:04,255
You should listen
to your mother!

779
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:06,259
God damn it, Kristen,
you ruin everything!

780
01:12:06,293 --> 01:12:07,988
Every time I bring a man home,
you spoil it!

781
01:12:08,028 --> 01:12:11,759
You know what your shrink says?
You just want attention!

782
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:49,124
Is that you?

783
01:13:43,556 --> 01:13:45,683
Welcome home, Taryn.

784
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,427
Look familiar?

785
01:13:48,461 --> 01:13:52,557
OK, asshole, let's dance!

786
01:14:07,447 --> 01:14:10,041
Why should we fight?

787
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:12,551
We're old friends, you and I.

788
01:14:12,585 --> 01:14:14,075
Remember?

789
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:19,649
Let's get high.

790
01:14:41,481 --> 01:14:43,608
What a rush.

791
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:01,190
You guys? Where are you?

792
01:15:05,372 --> 01:15:07,169
Is somebody there?

793
01:15:27,660 --> 01:15:30,288
You look tired.

794
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:31,820
Have a seat.

795
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:36,357
No, thanks.
I'm fine just the way I am.

796
01:15:36,403 --> 01:15:38,394
For now, maybe.

797
01:15:38,438 --> 01:15:40,372
But when you wake up...

798
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:44,743
it's back...

799
01:15:44,778 --> 01:15:47,246
in the saddle...

800
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,145
again.

801
01:15:56,723 --> 01:15:58,816
My leg!

802
01:16:03,363 --> 01:16:06,127
It's the chair for you, kid!

803
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,690
I am the Wizard Master.

804
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:12,035
I am the Wizard Master!

805
01:16:22,048 --> 01:16:26,348
In the name of Lowrek,
Prince of Elves, demon begone!

806
01:16:35,728 --> 01:16:39,562
Sorry, kid.
I don't believe in fairy tales.

807
01:16:47,907 --> 01:16:49,738
Somebody?

808
01:17:01,521 --> 01:17:02,954
What is that?

809
01:17:02,989 --> 01:17:04,718
I don't know.

810
01:17:11,331 --> 01:17:13,128
Yo. I thought I heard voices.

811
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,698
Kincaid, I could kiss you.

812
01:17:20,507 --> 01:17:22,338
What's stopping you?

813
01:17:23,877 --> 01:17:25,640
Cool. So where's Joey?

814
01:17:25,678 --> 01:17:27,771
I don't know.
This place is a maze.

815
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:30,476
It's time to stop guessin'
and start messin'.

816
01:17:30,517 --> 01:17:33,714
Yo, Freddy, where you hiding,
you burnt-face pussy!

817
01:17:33,753 --> 01:17:35,550
We should find the others first.

818
01:17:35,588 --> 01:17:38,056
You think you're hot shit,
don't you?

819
01:17:38,091 --> 01:17:39,581
Come get a piece of me!

820
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:42,254
Krueger, pussy!

821
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:46,198
I knew he was a little chicken.

822
01:17:46,232 --> 01:17:47,563
Shit.

823
01:18:02,515 --> 01:18:05,882
- It's a door.
- But it doesn't go anywhere.

824
01:18:07,053 --> 01:18:08,782
Yes, it does.

825
01:18:23,169 --> 01:18:24,295
This is it.

826
01:18:24,337 --> 01:18:25,929
Are you ready?

827
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:30,734
Let's snuff the sucker.

828
01:19:16,889 --> 01:19:18,857
That's it.

829
01:19:19,859 --> 01:19:21,349
The Caddy.

830
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:29,223
Going somewhere?

831
01:20:32,999 --> 01:20:36,628
I said I'd show you where
the goddamn thing was.

832
01:20:36,669 --> 01:20:38,136
I never said I'd stick around.

833
01:20:38,171 --> 01:20:41,106
- We've got work to do.
- What are you talking about?

834
01:20:41,140 --> 01:20:43,108
You're about to attend
a funeral...

835
01:20:43,142 --> 01:20:45,702
one that's long overdue.

836
01:21:49,509 --> 01:21:52,137
Joey, look.

837
01:21:52,178 --> 01:21:55,636
All the little piggies
come home.

838
01:21:55,681 --> 01:21:57,308
Let him go, Krueger!

839
01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:01,377
Your wish is my command.

840
01:23:26,339 --> 01:23:28,307
He's never been this strong.

841
01:23:34,547 --> 01:23:37,641
The souls of children...

842
01:23:37,683 --> 01:23:39,583
give me strength.

843
01:23:46,492 --> 01:23:48,289
Always room for more.

844
01:24:13,119 --> 01:24:15,610
- What's that?
- What?

845
01:24:24,497 --> 01:24:26,192
Listen.

846
01:24:31,904 --> 01:24:33,895
Somebody else is out here.

847
01:24:38,244 --> 01:24:39,404
We're alone.

848
01:25:16,449 --> 01:25:18,610
Bury the fucking thing!

849
01:25:34,300 --> 01:25:35,790
It's really you.

850
01:25:39,472 --> 01:25:43,101
I killed you once before,
you son of a bitch.

851
01:26:27,953 --> 01:26:29,614
Let's try this way.

852
01:26:31,257 --> 01:26:32,690
Kristen, can you pull us out?

853
01:26:32,725 --> 01:26:34,556
They sedated me.
We're stuck here.

854
01:26:34,593 --> 01:26:36,185
It's a dead end.

855
01:26:37,596 --> 01:26:39,223
What the hell?

856
01:26:43,335 --> 01:26:45,360
Sorry to keep you waiting.

857
01:26:45,404 --> 01:26:49,431
Perhaps if there was more of me
to spread around.

858
01:27:45,397 --> 01:27:47,729
Wow.

859
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:49,234
Did I say that?

860
01:27:49,268 --> 01:27:51,463
You found your dream power.

861
01:27:51,504 --> 01:27:53,096
You saved us, Joey.

862
01:27:53,139 --> 01:27:56,233
- You blew him away!
- Put me down.

863
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:57,742
Are you OK?

864
01:27:57,777 --> 01:27:59,369
I think so.

865
01:27:59,411 --> 01:28:01,311
He's gone.

866
01:28:02,948 --> 01:28:04,643
It's over.

867
01:28:19,298 --> 01:28:20,890
Daddy?

868
01:28:20,933 --> 01:28:23,697
I've crossed over, princess.

869
01:28:26,972 --> 01:28:29,167
Crossed over?

870
01:28:29,208 --> 01:28:32,837
I couldn't go without
telling you how sorry I am...

871
01:28:32,878 --> 01:28:35,938
for all the things I've done.

872
01:28:35,981 --> 01:28:38,006
I love you so much.

873
01:28:39,485 --> 01:28:41,009
I'll always love you.

874
01:28:41,987 --> 01:28:44,649
I'll always love you.

875
01:28:57,236 --> 01:28:58,794
Die.

876
01:29:15,421 --> 01:29:18,948
You're mine now, little piggy.

877
01:29:44,049 --> 01:29:47,109
Please, God, for the children.

878
01:29:47,152 --> 01:29:48,642
For Nancy.

879
01:29:50,089 --> 01:29:51,681
Ashes to ashes.

880
01:29:56,729 --> 01:29:58,162
Dust to dust.

881
01:30:02,301 --> 01:30:05,099
Lay this spirit to rest.

882
01:30:23,756 --> 01:30:26,782
I won't let you die.
I won't let you.

883
01:30:26,825 --> 01:30:30,352
I'm going to dream you
into a beautiful dream...

884
01:30:30,396 --> 01:30:32,159
forever and ever.

885
01:30:43,742 --> 01:30:46,006
"Trust in Him at all times.

886
01:30:46,145 --> 01:30:48,375
"Pour out your hearts to Him...

887
01:30:48,414 --> 01:30:50,382
"for God is our refuge.

888
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:52,316
"Hear my cry, O God.

889
01:30:52,351 --> 01:30:53,818
"Listen to my prayer.

890
01:30:53,852 --> 01:30:56,980
"From the ends of the earth,
I call to you.

891
01:30:57,022 --> 01:30:58,956
"I call as my heart grows faint.

892
01:30:58,991 --> 01:31:01,482
"Lead me to the rock
that is higher than I.

893
01:31:01,527 --> 01:31:03,825
"For You have been my refuge...

894
01:31:03,862 --> 01:31:07,059
"a strong tower against the foe.

895
01:31:07,099 --> 01:31:08,999
"I long to dwell
in the tent forever...

896
01:31:09,034 --> 01:31:12,333
"and take refuge in the shelter
of Your wings."

897
01:31:12,371 --> 01:31:15,169
Even though we entrust Nancy
to the earth...

898
01:31:15,207 --> 01:31:18,005
her courage and spirit
shall remain with us...

899
01:31:18,043 --> 01:31:20,341
for the Lord God
has comforted us...

900
01:31:20,379 --> 01:31:23,678
saying, "That whoever
finds his life will lose it...

901
01:31:23,716 --> 01:31:27,846
"and whoever loses his life
for my sake, will find it.

902
01:31:27,886 --> 01:31:31,253
"They shall live forever
in the glory of His kingdom.

903
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:33,121
"May the Lord bless you
and keep you.

904
01:31:33,158 --> 01:31:36,025
"The Lord make his face
to shine down upon you...

905
01:31:36,061 --> 01:31:38,029
"and be gracious to you.

906
01:31:38,063 --> 01:31:40,554
"The Lord turn His face
toward you and give you peace."

907
01:31:40,599 --> 01:31:41,896
Oh, my God.

908
01:31:43,569 --> 01:31:45,764
You were his mother.
