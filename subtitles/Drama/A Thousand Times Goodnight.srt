1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,930
Loving You a Thousand Times

3
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,050
Kang Ho. Why are you doing this?

4
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,205
Listen carefully to what I'm saying.

5
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,705
You have to choose one from two options.

6
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:46,350
Do you want to live with me or see me die?

7
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,855
What do you mean by that?

8
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,090
Hurry and make a decision!

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,750
Kang Ho.

10
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:55,760
Don't be like this.

11
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,400
What's the use?

12
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,320
Right, fine then.

13
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,990
Kang Ho!

14
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,880
Kang Ho, why are you doing this?

15
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,090
Hurry up and come out!

16
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,150
Let go of me.

17
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,520
You go over there!

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,620
Why are you being like this?

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,620
If you do this, then what am I supposed to do?!

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,270
I told you to let go of me!

21
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,610
Do you want to die too?

22
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,990
Fine!

23
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:41,360
Then let's die together.

24
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:45,105
Let's just die together.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,200
Does anyone say that they want to
break up because they really want to?

26
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,930
I don't want us to end either!

27
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,020
But we have no choice!

28
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,370
So, let's die together!

29
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,210
Eun Nim!

30
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,230
Eun Nim!

31
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,440
Eun Nim!

32
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,290
I'm sorry! I was wrong.

33
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,430
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,250
What do you want me to do?

35
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,950
What am I supposed to do?!

36
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:21,930
I'm sorry, I won't do it again.

37
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,750
Kang Ho, I'm sorry.

38
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,660
I'm sorry that this is all I can be for you.

39
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,020
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,020
I was wrong.

41
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,210
I'm sorry.

42
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,260
We...

43
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,940
Should we date?

44
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,450
I love you Eun Nim.

45
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,950
I really love you.

46
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,310
Eun Nim,

47
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,110
what I said yesterday...

48
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,580
was sincere.

49
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,170
If you really love me, don't be like this.

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,240
If you're like this, Kang Ho,
it makes things harder for me!

51
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:01,890
If it's because of me,
I'm really okay so go slowly.

52
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,070
I can't bring myself to do it.

53
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,020
I don't have the heart to make things difficult for you.

54
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:11,120
So please, let go of me.

55
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,630
So this...

56
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,820
It's the end for us.

57
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:09,540
Be well,

58
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,340
and don't get sick.

59
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:21,480
I'll leave now so drive home safely.

60
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,600
Go Eun Nim!

61
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,310
It's cold.

62
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,000
What?

63
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,450
Is Eun Nim not back yet?

64
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,450
Yeah.

65
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,070
It's already almost midnight.

66
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,230
Why isn't she coming home?

67
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,620
Honey, could she have gone on a date
with Son-in-law Baek somewhere nice?

68
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,230
I'm not sure. It would be nice if that were the case...

69
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,750
Eun Nim isn't a child.

70
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,430
You must be cold too so go in and sleep
so you can get up for work tomorrow.

71
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,160
All right, just go in and sleep first.

72
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,420
Eun Nim!

73
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:38,550
Why? Why are you in this state?

74
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,770
You weren't sleeping yet?

75
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,870
Did you fall in the water or something?

76
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,180
What happened to you?

77
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,010
I'm going to wash up and change my clothes.

78
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,560
Hey, Eun Nim!

79
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,140
What in the world happened to her?

80
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:01,980
After Eun Nim's washed up,
tell her to come to the room.

81
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,480
Did something happen today?

82
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:26,800
Were you with Son-in-law Baek today?

83
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,420
Yes.

84
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:31,690
But then why did you fall in the water?

85
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,170
Did you and son-in-law Baek go play
around in the water or something?

86
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,240
Does she look like she went to play with water?

87
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:43,070
Please, tell us.

88
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:46,720
Your eyes are swollen like you cried a lot..

89
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:49,330
And it seems like something did happen.

90
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,410
That's right.

91
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,640
You said you were with son-in-law Baek,
but why didn't you come in together?

92
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,500
Dad, Mom.

93
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,790
Kang Ho's not going to come here anymore.

94
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,790
What do you mean by that?

95
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,780
What do you mean Son-in-law Baek
won't be coming by anymore?

96
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,250
Kang Ho and I...

97
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,430
We have cleanly ended things between us
and decided to get a divorce,

98
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,240
so I just wanted to let you know.

99
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,630
What?

100
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,850
Wh-what are you talking about?

101
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,030
Even until yesterday Son-in-law Baek said
that he'd never be able to get a divorce..

102
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,780
So did you insist on it then?

103
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,370
Eun Nim, what kind of manners are these?

104
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,700
Continuing to talk about divorce in front of adults...

105
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,630
Divorce isn't something so easily spoken about, but you're
talking about it as readily as you would have a meal!

106
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,840
<i>Throughout life, there are times when men and women
make mistakes and sometimes fall into temptation.</i>

107
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,120
But just because of that, do they all divorce?

108
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,840
Eun Nim, were you always this reckless?

109
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,570
You've severely disappointed your father.

110
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,160
I'm sorry.

111
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,140
Why are you really being like this?

112
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:08,110
You let that great husband go, and have you decided to
kick away all of your blessings with your own two feet?

113
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,920
Oh dear.

114
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,010
What are you doing?

115
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,090
Are you drinking right now?

116
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,180
I can't fall asleep.

117
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,480
Yes, it'd be weird if you could fall asleep right away.

118
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,530
Give me a glass too.

119
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,930
You want some liquor too, Mother-in-law?

120
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,930
Yes.

121
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,290
If I drink some liquor, I'm hoping
I'll be able to get some sleep.

122
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,330
I couldn't fall asleep, so I came
out to warm up a cup of milk.

123
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,040
Here.

124
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,780
How strong.

125
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,340
How could you drink this when it tastes so bad?

126
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,990
Anyway,

127
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:35,250
you don't think Kang Ho is going to
sleep at his in-laws' house, right?

128
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:45,580
Your sister-in-law told us that she was
going to cleanly cut things off and divorce,

129
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,240
but you don't think she's trying to force him
to live with her there, do you?

130
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:53,150
Do you believe what that woman says, Mother-in-law?

131
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:55,920
That woman is capable of more than that.

132
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,750
I can't ever believe what that woman says until she
stamps the divorce papers with Brother-in-law.

133
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:07,660
She says she won't do that in front of us, but see
what happens if she goes back on her word.

134
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,020
What are you doing here?

135
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,380
What... are you two drinking
in the middle of the night and gossiping?

136
00:14:18,430 --> 00:14:21,080
No, of course not. Why would we drink?

137
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:23,640
Why aren't you sleeping?

138
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,680
Kang Ho hasn't come home yet!
And he's not picking up his phone either.

139
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:33,760
Why aren't you all sleeping yet?

140
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,660
You weren't sleeping yet either?

141
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:39,740
Ah yes, I have a meeting early tomorrow morning
so I wanted to go over some of the documents.

142
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,740
Is there something wrong?

143
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,510
Brother-in-law hasn't come in yet and isn't picking up
his phone so Grandmother-in-law has been worrying.

144
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:51,100
Mother-in-law, he's probably with
his friends drinking or something.

145
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,380
It's because he went out in the morning like that.

146
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:01,500
I don't know if I pressured him to divorce
Granddaughter-in-law and made things worse.

147
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,740
Maybe I should've just left them
to resolve things on their own.

148
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,860
People always said that if the wrong woman
marries into a household, their bad luck never ends.

149
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,870
I don't know what all of this is.

150
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:21,060
Grandmother, don't worry too much and get some sleep.

151
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,550
Okay then.

152
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:32,740
No. Oh dear, I don't know why I'm so anxious.

153
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,110
Hey Daughter-in-law, call Granddaughter-in-law.

154
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,190
What?

155
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:40,190
At this hour?

156
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,250
Yes, Mother-in-law.

157
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,700
Are you with Kang Ho right now?

158
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,700
No, I'm not.

159
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:11,700
Is it... Kang Ho hasn't gone home yet?

160
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,480
Yes.

161
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,850
Did you meet him then?

162
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,450
Yes.

163
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,500
We split up though.

164
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,570
I thought he went straight home.

165
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:26,840
What did you do when you two met?

166
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:32,630
The problem of Kang Ho and I has been resolved.

167
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:34,630
You don't have to worry.

168
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:40,680
Really? All right then.

169
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:44,770
What did she say?

170
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,770
The two of them met, right?

171
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:50,620
Yes. But she said that they already
went their separate ways.

172
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,250
I wonder where he went.

173
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,300
What did she say they talked about?

174
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:56,700
Did she say something else happened?

175
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,040
They've decided to end it.

176
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,100
End it? Is that true?

177
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,100
Yes.

178
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,960
Oh dear. Oh my, why is my heart racing?

179
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,690
Why am I so anxious?

180
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,350
You don't think something bad is
going to happen, do you?

181
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,200
Mother-in-law, please!
What do you think could happen?

182
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,000
Did Grandmother-in-law go into her room?

183
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,190
Yes.

184
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,780
Even though Grandmother-in-law is upset about it,

185
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,230
it's a good thing that Brother-in-law and
Sister-in-law have decided to divorce.

186
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,230
It's for everyone's sake.

187
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,060
Do you know that you're really
cold and cruel sometimes?

188
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,040
What did you say?

189
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,580
Even though you know how much
Kang Ho and Eun Nim love each other,

190
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,300
how can you speak like you're talking about strangers?

191
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:19,470
How deep do you think Kang Ho and
Eun Nim's pain is right now?

192
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,520
It seems that you only know one thing instead of two.

193
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:29,180
Just because it hurts a little right now, what if
they were to leave things the way they were?

194
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,210
With time, things will explode.

195
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:35,470
Then they'll have to cut things out
and operate, and it'll hurt more.

196
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,470
Why don't you know that?

197
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,930
What?

198
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,520
And just because they're having a hard time since they've
decided to break up, you want to keep living with them?

199
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,520
What's bad about that?

200
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,980
What?

201
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:55,620
Honey,

202
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,650
why do we have to fight about something like this?

203
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:05,400
They're adults and they've come to
this decision themselves, isn't that so?

204
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:14,480
It seems like you don't feel sorry towards
Kang Ho or Eun Nim at all.

205
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,450
What's that supposed to mean?

206
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,200
Who's the one who should be sorry?

207
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:25,310
Do you know how hard it was
for me because of that woman?

208
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,710
Why did all of this happen?

209
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:29,710
Where did it start?

210
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,960
What?

211
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:39,670
I think that the two of us should be feeling
incredibly sorry to the two of them.

212
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:44,290
Just now, you...

213
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,820
What is it you want to say?

214
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:51,840
Are you saying this is all my fault?

215
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:56,230
You of all people should understand
what I'm trying to say.

216
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:17,810
So you're saying that this all happened
because I couldn't have kids?

217
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:48,380
<i>This device has been turned off, so please
leave a message after the beep.</i>

218
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:53,590
He didn't even change out of those wet clothes.

219
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,590
Where did he go?

220
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:56,580
That's Kang Ho's car.

221
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,580
He wasn't inside though.

222
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,810
Kang Ho!

223
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,260
Kang Ho!

224
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,260
Kang Ho!

225
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,590
Kang Ho!

226
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,280
What's wrong with you, Kang Ho?

227
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,640
Kang Ho!

228
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,690
How could something like this happen?!

229
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,370
What are we going to do if something
bad happened to Kang Ho?

230
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,290
I can't live if it does!
Mother, don't worry too much

231
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,960
He'll be fine.
What are we going to do?

232
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,260
Did Chauffeur Kim come yet?

233
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:53,210
Yes.

234
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,660
I'll take Yoo Bin to kindergarten and go right after.

235
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,290
All right.

236
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:00,170
Oh no, what are we going to do about our Kang Ho?

237
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:04,040
Ahjumma, please make a simple breakfast for Yoo Bin.

238
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:09,400
How could all of this happen?

239
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,770
Yes, it's me.

240
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,170
Did Kang Ho go home last night?

241
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,440
He's not picking up his phone.

242
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,650
Something terrible has happened!

243
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,220
Something terrible?

244
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,220
What happened?

245
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,330
What?!

246
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,330
Kang Ho did what?!

247
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:51,850
But, Doctor.

248
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,730
Why is he like this?

249
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:57,040
Why isn't he opening his eyes?
It seems like he's dead!

250
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,250
It's a huge relief.

251
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:01,490
If we'd been any later,
his heart would've stopped beating.

252
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,080
What did you-

253
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:02,510
Oh my.

254
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,670
Oh no, Grandmother!

255
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,350
Then...how is he now?

256
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,270
Will he be okay?

257
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:14,290
When he first arrived the hospital, his breathing
was light and his pulse was weak.

258
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:17,510
He's slowly getting better so I think
you can stop worrying now.

259
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:23,760
Thank you, Doctor.
Thank you so much.

260
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:32,760
Why would he sleep in the car in wet clothes
during this cold winter and create such a ruckus?

261
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,760
Sae Hun, you saved your little brother's life.

262
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,180
If we had found him a little later,
would would've happened?

263
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,210
Sister-in-law!

264
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:51,090
Why have you come here?

265
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,160
Kang Ho... they've said that Kang Ho collapsed!

266
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:56,590
Sister-in-law, why would Kang Ho collapse?

267
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,590
What in the world happened?

268
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,870
I thought you said you two have decided to end it.

269
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:03,350
Then shouldn't you mind your own business?

270
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,580
What?

271
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,310
You're about to become a stranger
to us, so why would you come here?

272
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,360
You could make Brother-in-law think
second thoughts, so go back home.

273
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:14,860
I've come because they told me that he's collapsed
and not anything else, so how could you be like this?

274
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,170
You!

275
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,670
Does what I'm telling you not seem like words to you?

276
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,510
I said go home!

277
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:21,100
Let go of me.

278
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,980
If you're that curious, I'll tell you
how he is over the phone.

279
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,580
So go home.

280
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,960
Yoo Bin's mom!

281
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,760
Sister-in-law, you've come?

282
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,260
Yes.

283
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,310
Where's Kang Ho?

284
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,490
Go on in.

285
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,490
It's all the way on the end.

286
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,440
Yes.

287
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,060
You, stop right there!

288
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,620
Why are you doing this?

289
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,440
How can we send that woman to Brother-in-law?

290
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,400
We've just managed to tear them apart!

291
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,400
You stay still.

292
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,400
Let the two of them handle their own problems.

293
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,720
Got it?

294
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,830
The color of his face has gotten a lot better than before.

295
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,010
Yes, he has.

296
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:13,880
Mother, the doctor said that
he's okay now so please go home.

297
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:17,670
No! Don't worry about me and go to work, Son.

298
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,830
That's right, we'll stay here so go to work.

299
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:29,190
Yes! Now all we need to wait for his pulses and body
temperature back to normal, so don't worry and go on.

300
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:31,380
All right.

301
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,120
If he wakes up, give me a call.

302
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,880
Okay.

303
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,810
Daughter-in-law has come.

304
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,360
Huh? Granddaughter-in-law has come?

305
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,760
Oh no! How did she find out and come?

306
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,320
Why aren't you coming in? Go ahead.

307
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,710
Yes, sir.

308
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,500
Kang Ho, your wife is here.

309
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,060
Huh? So you have to wake up now!

310
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,590
Let's go home, please!

311
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,060
He was on dangerous ground and almost died.

312
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,350
He spent all night in his car in soaking wet clothes..

313
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:40,210
What did you do to get your clothes all wet?

314
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,880
But why has your hand been in a fist since before?

315
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,330
Unclench it!

316
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
Unclench it.

317
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,900
What is this?

318
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:57,140
Isn't this your wedding ring?

319
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:59,830
Oh my heart feels like it's going to explode.

320
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:05,340
You had this clenched in your hand
and wanted to die, you rascal?!

321
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,880
Grandmother.

322
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:21,200
That's right! He's come back to.

323
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:26,060
Kang Ho! Your wife has come too.

324
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:31,327
Kang Ho.

325
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,390
Mother-in-law!

326
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,250
Huh? Oh.

327
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,570
Where's Sae Hun?

328
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,570
He went with Father-in-law to the office.

329
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:50,690
But how did she know to come here?

330
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,190
I'm not sure.

331
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,440
How are the two of them right now?

332
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:57,960
Sad, very sad.

333
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,050
And your grandmother-in-law is
next to them making it worse.

334
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:04,860
If they get back together at this rate,
what do we do then?

335
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:11,270
Hey, let's go now.

336
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,720
Then what do we do about Kang Ho?

337
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,460
I left him to granddaughter-in-law.

338
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:19,840
Mother-in-law! They said that
they were going to divorce!

339
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:23,000
Why would you leave Kang Ho to her?!

340
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:29,440
It seems like all you want is for them to divorce!

341
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,580
What in the world is your reason for acting like that?

342
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,610
When did I?!

343
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:40,160
From what I can see, those two cannot divorce.

344
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,160
They can never divorce!

345
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,590
Let's go home now.

346
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,830
Come on.

347
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,060
How can you sleep in your car
when you're wearing wet clothes?

348
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,610
What would I have done if you died that way?

349
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,170
Are you a fool, Kang Ho?

350
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,490
I just...

351
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:08,170
didn't want to go into the house when you weren't there.

352
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,510
So..

353
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:16,480
I was just going to sit for a while before I went in.

354
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,820
I get so sad because of you, Kang Ho.

355
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,390
What's wrong, Mother-in-law?

356
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,320
Huh?

357
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:52,390
It's just I felt like I saw that woman somewhere before.

358
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,390
Maybe not?

359
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,650
I'm such a fool..

360
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,860
All I have to do is disregard my pride one more time,

361
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:10,860
so why can't I involve myself?

362
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,430
If Yeon Hee were to find out that
I was doing this, I really could die.

363
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:20,830
This brat.

364
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,490
She won't even pick up my phone calls
and I don't know where she is.

365
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:28,320
Will she appear if my heart were to explode and I died?

366
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,600
Where did my Chul go?

367
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:12,130
How can you go out by yourself without waking me up?

368
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,970
I heard that women tend to sleep
more when they're pregnant.

369
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:17,890
And also, Nan Jung, you over-exerted
yourself too much lately.

370
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,100
You're really tired, aren't you?

371
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:22,070
Tired? I'm not tired at all!

372
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,710
I'll be right there.

373
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,890
I'm telling you to rest a little more!

374
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,830
I'm saying I want to go because I miss you soooooo much.

375
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:35,230
Okay then. If that's the reason, come right now.

376
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:38,200
Okay! I'll be there in a flash.

377
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,610
Hey, what are you doing right now?

378
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,720
Wow, you guys even kiss like that over the phone?

379
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,130
Honey, I'd better get off the phone.

380
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,060
I'm sorry.

381
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,200
Oh my.

382
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:01,990
What was that look?

383
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,730
Was she feeling sorry for a single old spinster, or what?

384
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,150
Oh, my blood pressure. Oh it's going up again!

385
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,530
Yes, it's me.

386
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:22,860
Did you.. eat breakfast?

387
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,860
I drank coffee.

388
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,900
What about food?

389
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,500
I don't know!

390
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,150
Why did you call?

391
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:32,740
Why don't you ever eat?

392
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,280
Eat some food, food!

393
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,400
You need to eat in order to have energy!

394
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:39,330
My stomach keeps getting fatter
because I only eat and sit!

395
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:45,030
I'll take responsibility for that stomach,
so don't worry and eat some food.

396
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,560
Okay? Got it?

397
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,690
Oh my!

398
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,810
Unni,

399
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,200
Did you mention me to PD Bong?

400
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,220
I'm.. hanging up now!

401
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,580
Huh?

402
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,650
What about you?

403
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:10,360
I asked you to properly introduce me and PD Bong.

404
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,570
Uh.. well,

405
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:20,100
So Weol, I did that before you said anything.

406
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,850
But... I don't think he's right for you.

407
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,520
You're right..

408
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,170
since he works in entertainment, he must have young,
sexy girls following him around.

409
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,720
He probably wouldn't even notice a person like me.

410
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,180
Hey!

411
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,210
When I was begging you to get married,
you just sat back and didn't do anything about it.

412
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:42,140
Why are you acting like this now
when I have so much on my mind?

413
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,750
I'm sorry, Unni.

414
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:48,140
I couldn't get married like everyone else
does and I'm just a nuisance to you.

415
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:53,820
Why don't you sign up with a matchmaking agency?

416
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:56,160
I'll pay for the enrolling costs.

417
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,220
R-really, Unni?

418
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,940
Your age is 41?

419
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,280
Yes.

420
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,640
You don't have a job.

421
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,920
Instead of saying I don't have one,

422
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,950
I'm actually helping out my sister as a housekeeper.

423
00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,960
If I were to calculate my salary,
it'd be 2 million Won.

424
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,090
Right?

425
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,880
Yes!

426
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,240
So you're saying you are looking for man
that is first time marriage with steady job?

427
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:32,720
Yes!

428
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:39,980
I'm sorry, but there's no one who would
match you in our registry, Miss Kim So Weol.

429
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:41,630
W-w-what?

430
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,860
Even if I pay the enrollment costs?

431
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:47,670
Why don't you try going somewhere else?

432
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,270
Your qualifications don't meet
what we look for in candidates.

433
00:35:57,840 --> 00:36:02,920
<i>I'm sorry to say this, but I think it'd be faster
if you went to a matchmaking instead.</i>

434
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:31,550
Even though I don't have anything of worth,
I'm still a pure virgin.

435
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,780
But what?

436
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,350
Go to matchmaking?

437
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,510
What did he see me as?

438
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:49,130
Just because I'm old, I can only get single fathers
or divorcees, that's all that's left for me!

439
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:56,260
This dirty society that cares so much about age!

440
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,700
Aunt!

441
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:05,400
Forget those ridiculous things
as you drink a refreshing beer.

442
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,390
Chul, it really is ridiculous, right?

443
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,180
Of course!

444
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,160
Where is it?

445
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,350
Should I go and have a word with them?

446
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:16,160
Honey, are you really going to go?

447
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:21,830
Moooommmmm...

448
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,170
Aunt, please stop crying.

449
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:32,550
Ah Aunt, I'll do whatever I can to find
someone who matches you perfectly.

450
00:37:33,230 --> 00:37:37,110
That kind of person doesn't exist.

451
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:41,130
So why did you waste money
and go to a place like that?

452
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,400
Did the money rot?

453
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,860
Mom, please, stop.

454
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,860
Mother-in-law..

455
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:49,300
Instead, think about it carefully.

456
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:52,700
You never know, there could be someone around you.

457
00:37:54,590 --> 00:38:00,830
People have always said that your future
spouse can be found near you, not far.

458
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,520
Do you really have no one that you like right now?

459
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,010
Aunt, is there?

460
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,340
Tell us!

461
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,100
We'll help you along!

462
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,380
Well that..

463
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:16,290
There is someone, isn't there?

464
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,290
Who is it?

465
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,910
That..

466
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:24,120
He's younger than me, and I'm lacking in so many ways..

467
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:27,160
Oh please! That doesn't matter
in man-woman relationships!

468
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,280
You just give it a shot and if it doesn't
work out then that's that.

469
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,810
It won't cost you any.

470
00:38:34,870 --> 00:38:36,450
Tell us, who is it?

471
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,900
That's right, Aunt! Tell us.

472
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:41,580
If it's someone we know, we'll help you.

473
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:48,450
I don't like him a lot, but I am a little interested.

474
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:51,410
Ah it doesn't matter how much, just tell us, who is it?

475
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,980
PD Bong...

476
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:56,510
What?

477
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,510
PD Bong?!

478
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,820
You mean the man who's working
with Chung Ja, Director Bong?

479
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,350
Oh my god.

480
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:09,870
Oh my god.

481
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,190
Oh, Mrs. Ahn. Did you clean Kang Ho's room well?

482
00:39:22,210 --> 00:39:23,870
You changed all the sheets as well?

483
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:25,870
Yes ma'am.

484
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:31,820
They said that he left the hospital already,
so why isn't he home yet?

485
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,070
Kang Ho!

486
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,070
Are you okay now?

487
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,490
I'm okay, Grandmother.

488
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,750
Great.

489
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,060
Go on up.

490
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,060
Go upstairs and get a lot of rest.

491
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,100
Granddaughter-in-law, you'd better take good care of him!

492
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,840
Yes ma'am.

493
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:06,300
Seeing them together like that is
finally giving me peace of mind.

494
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:10,670
Oh, Mrs. Ahn, please give me a warm
cup of ginseng tea too please.

495
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,380
Yes, ma'am.

496
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:28,790
Don't go anywhere from now on.

497
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:31,230
Okay?

498
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:33,230
All right.

499
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm not going anywhere,
and I'll stay right next to you, Kang Ho.

500
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,160
She... she's still in Kang Ho's room?

501
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,080
Yes.

502
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,670
What should we do, Mother-in-law?

503
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,280
What if she doesn't leave?

504
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,210
She said with her own mouth that she was going to
divorce him, so do you think that would happen?

505
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,970
She just came because Kang Ho wasn't well.

506
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,600
That's what you and I are thinking.

507
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,600
What if she doesn't leave?

508
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,630
Why do you keep thinking that she's not going
to leave? Does that even make sense?

509
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,840
How could she live in this house?

510
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,340
What are you doing right now?

511
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,730
I'm making some rice porridge for Kang Ho.

512
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,020
There are many people who can make rice porridge here,

513
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:49,290
so it'd be best if you left now.

514
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,570
Mother-in-law,

515
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,580
I've come in for good.

516
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,380
What?

517
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,380
For good?

518
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:01,850
With whose permission?

519
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,490
You... we need to talk.

520
00:42:19,890 --> 00:42:22,190
Why is madam acting like that?

521
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,220
Why are you acting like this?

522
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,220
With whose permission would you come back for good?

523
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,450
You said with your own mouth that you were going
to divorce Kang Ho, that it was all over!

524
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,900
What are you doing?!

525
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:37,900
I...

526
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,910
I've tried to break up with Kang Ho.

527
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:46,020
But I can't bring myself to go through with it.

528
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,100
Mother-in-law.

529
00:42:49,830 --> 00:42:53,940
Can't you just give Kang Ho and I a chance?

530
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:59,440
Kang Ho and I will go somewhere far away to live.

531
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,400
Don't worry about Yoo Bin.

532
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:06,340
I won't get greedy about him at all.

533
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:11,350
So Mother-in-law, can you just give me this chance?

534
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:18,470
Is this something that'll work out
even if I give you a chance?

535
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,470
Then I would've given it to you already.

536
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:25,300
Because that's not so,
because this can't be, I said no already!

537
00:43:25,550 --> 00:43:27,300
Mother-in-law.

538
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,310
Aunt!

539
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,650
Yoo Bin! Let's go eat some snacks.

540
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,340
Yes, Yoo Bin. Go eat a snack.

541
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,670
Take Yoo Bin and get out.

542
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:47,670
Yoo Bin, let's go eat something good.

543
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,050
Do you want ice cream?

544
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,150
Let's get out.

545
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:54,310
Yoo Bin is here!

546
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,640
What are you doing in here, Granddaughter-in-law?

547
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:04,820
Ah, it's just because I thought
Mother-in-law needed something.

548
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:07,780
There are a lot of people who'll
take care of your mother-in-law,

549
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:11,711
so go on upstairs and take good care of your husband.

550
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:13,050
Yes.

551
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:24,540
Kang Ho, you're so good,
eating all of your rice porridge.

552
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:29,750
I need to eat a lot and be healthy so I can look after my wife.

553
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:32,430
Here.

554
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,720
Now take your medicine.

555
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,500
Since you've eaten your rice porridge and
taken your medicine, get some sleep.

556
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,500
Don't think about anything.

557
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:58,500
All right.

558
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:13,530
I listened to everything you told me to do,
but you're just leaving like that?

559
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:16,700
Okay.

560
00:45:28,110 --> 00:45:32,230
You're not going to run away
while I'm sleeping, right?

561
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:39,450
I won't run away! I told you
I was going to stay by your side.

562
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,570
Then come here.

563
00:45:53,620 --> 00:45:55,030
Kang Ho.

564
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:00,050
If you're really not going to run away again,
put this ring back on.

565
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,260
He ate all of the rice porridge.

566
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:36,260
Yes. He ate it all, and he's sleeping now.

567
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:38,130
It's good you came.

568
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,220
While you were gone, Kang Ho looked so pitiful.

569
00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:47,550
Aunt!

570
00:46:47,620 --> 00:46:49,190
Yoo Bin.

571
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,410
This is a present.

572
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:53,150
Present?

573
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,350
What could this be?

574
00:46:56,750 --> 00:46:58,940
It's you, Aunt.

575
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:02,170
The title is A face that I miss.

576
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,640
Wow.. our Yoo Bin drew this so well.

577
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,280
Thank you.

578
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,560
Sister-in-law!

579
00:47:23,450 --> 00:47:25,370
Mom, you're mean!

580
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,430
Yoo Bin! Stop crying!

581
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:27,890
Come.

582
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:30,430
Mom, you're mean!

583
00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:35,210
Why is Yoo Bin's mom like that?

584
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,740
Ahjumoni. Please don't tell the adults what happened.

585
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:42,520
All right.

586
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:01,390
Yoo Bin, stop crying!

587
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:04,880
How important is that drawing
for you to cry this much?

588
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,880
Mom, you're mean!

589
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,000
I don't like you!

590
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:14,570
If you don't like your mom,
then who do you like? Huh?

591
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:19,130
Yoo Bin, if you don't stop crying,
I'm really going to scold you!

592
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,420
Come here!

593
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:24,420
Bend over.

594
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,660
I told you to stop crying!

595
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,150
Why, why are you crying?!

596
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:28,990
Huh?

597
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,140
How important is that drawing for you to cry? Huh?

598
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,590
Sister-in-law, stop it!

599
00:48:34,970 --> 00:48:37,130
What do you think you're doing?

600
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:39,540
Don't hit Yoo Bin!

601
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:41,540
Why would you hit a child?

602
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:45,040
You.. who do you think you are?!

603
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:50,160
What are you doing in front of a child?

604
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:56,730
What's going on here? Huh?

605
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:58,430
Mother-in-law.

606
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:08,730
So why did you hit Yoo Bin?

607
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,330
What did he do for you to hit him?

608
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:17,860
Despite all that, who does she think she is to do that?

609
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,610
For as long as that woman is in this house,
she won't be able to let go of Yoo Bin.

610
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:28,040
What should we do?

611
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:30,040
I don't know.

612
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,700
She's hiding behind your grandmother-in-law and
father-in-law who don't know anything.

613
00:49:34,850 --> 00:49:38,590
But even so, we can't tell them about it.

614
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,080
No way, of course we can't!

615
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,610
If we did..

616
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,570
Oh, I don't even want to think about it.

617
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:03,980
Mother-in-law, Sister-in-law, I'm sorry.

618
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,040
Yoo Bin is Sister-in-law's son..

619
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:12,050
It was wrong of me to do that,

620
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:14,050
I overstepped my bounds.

621
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,970
Nothing like that will ever happen again.

622
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:29,180
Oh my..

623
00:50:29,690 --> 00:50:31,800
She scares me now.

624
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,190
She's a frightening girl.

625
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,230
You're really staying by my side and not running away.

626
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,390
Did you sleep well?

627
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:38,080
Are you okay now?

628
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,310
I'm okay now.

629
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,150
My body feels refreshed too,
maybe because I slept deeply.

630
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:48,900
Yes?

631
00:51:52,870 --> 00:51:55,090
Kang Ho, you're awake.

632
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,540
Yes, he just woke up.

633
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:04,250
The color of his face is completely back to normal now!

634
00:52:04,470 --> 00:52:07,470
Because my wife was taking care of me, Grandmother.

635
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,890
Here you go again.

636
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,750
You should come down now.

637
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:21,520
Your father-in-law and brother-in-law
have come home, so you should say hello.

638
00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:23,180
Yes, ma'am.

639
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:24,630
Okay.

640
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:31,370
I'm by your side.

641
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:32,960
It'll turn out fine.

642
00:52:40,060 --> 00:52:45,280
I hadn't said anything, but during that time,
I was feeling really frustrated.

643
00:52:45,350 --> 00:52:47,050
Come and sit down.

644
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,830
Now the house seems full.

645
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:56,660
Looking at you two makes me think that during that time,

646
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,600
our family had seemed frozen.

647
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:02,600
Now it finally seems like a flower has blossomed, Son.

648
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:05,580
Yes, it does.

649
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,520
We won't have to worry about you two now, right?

650
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:13,160
Yes.

651
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,230
I'm sorry about making you worry all this time.

652
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,670
I'm not sure what was going on,

653
00:53:21,020 --> 00:53:24,430
but Daughter-in-law, don't leave this house again.

654
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,470
Even if problems arise, you need to
be together here to resolve them.

655
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,470
Yes, Father-in-law.

656
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,290
But... I have something I want to tell you.

657
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:38,600
What is it?

658
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:39,880
Go ahead.

659
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:47,160
This person and I want to go live abroad for a while.

660
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,160
Abroad?

661
00:53:50,050 --> 00:53:53,770
Our subsidiary in America needs help,
do you want to go there?

662
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,860
Yes, that would be great, Hyung.

663
00:53:55,930 --> 00:53:56,770
I'll go there.

664
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:59,870
But why do you want to go live abroad all of a sudden?

665
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,870
I have a reason for that, Grandmother.

666
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,080
So please don't ask why, and let us go.

667
00:54:06,090 --> 00:54:09,190
Father, please give them permission.

668
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:10,570
All right, let's do that then.

669
00:54:26,970 --> 00:54:27,980
Did you want to see me?

670
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:28,630
Yes.

671
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:33,400
Is it about going to the U.S. branch?

672
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,530
Yes.

673
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,530
That, and...

674
00:54:38,090 --> 00:54:41,840
It seems like there's something going on
that I don't know about.

675
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:43,660
Yes.

676
00:54:43,910 --> 00:54:45,660
There was.

677
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,510
But I can't tell you what it was.

678
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,230
Trust me and please understand.

679
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:58,580
It's not a woman or a man problem, right?

680
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,580
No, it's not that kind of problem.

681
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:05,030
All right, fine. If it's not that kind of problem, that's fine.

682
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,030
All right, go on out.

683
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,310
Father.

684
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,980
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

685
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:35,490
What?

686
00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:38,430
You're at your in-laws' house right now?

687
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,430
Yes, Mom.

688
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:46,350
Kang Ho and I have decided to try again.

689
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,690
So don't worry, Mom.

690
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,690
Is that really true?

691
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:54,630
Oh, great! You decided well, Eun Nim!

692
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,010
Oh, my Eun Nim, you're so brave.

693
00:55:57,030 --> 00:55:59,030
My daughter is so brave.

694
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,370
What? What is it? She said that
she's back at the in-laws house?

695
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,840
Eun Nim, your grandmother came here
because she was worried.

696
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,610
So talk to her, okay?

697
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,470
Eun Nim!

698
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:13,890
Grandmother.

699
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:18,590
Yes, it's me. You decided well, Eun Nim!

700
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,580
Yes.

701
00:56:19,693 --> 00:56:20,617
What?

702
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,070
Oh, all right.

703
00:56:22,110 --> 00:56:24,590
Let's talk again soon then.

704
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,060
Okay.

705
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,290
Now I finally feel assured.

706
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,670
I know, right?

707
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,320
You're here?

708
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:35,180
Oh yes!

709
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:37,400
What's going on?

710
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,430
Honey, Eun Nim has gone back to the in-laws house.

711
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:42,400
Really?

712
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:43,440
Is that really true?

713
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:44,530
Yes!

714
00:56:44,590 --> 00:56:48,340
I think she and son-in-law Baek have finally made up.

715
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:49,850
That's great!

716
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:53,900
I finally think I can live now.

717
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,190
Oh my.

718
00:56:57,770 --> 00:57:03,650
But now that the kids are trying again, I don't know
if her sister-in-law will try and keep them apart.

719
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:04,280
What?

720
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:06,760
What do you mean by that?

721
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,800
What about Eun Nim's sister-in-law?

722
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,650
What?

723
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:12,640
Oh, it's nothing.

724
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:16,250
This is great.

725
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:17,670
Wow, how long has it been?

726
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:20,910
Coming out with you like this.

727
00:58:21,250 --> 00:58:22,670
Do you like it that much?

728
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,670
Yes, I do.

729
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:28,850
Then every time I have off, we should go out.

730
00:58:31,790 --> 00:58:36,560
Honey, we're people who've
received a lot of blessings.

731
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:38,970
Everything's gone well with our kids.

732
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:40,970
Yes, we are.

733
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:54,730
Here!

734
00:58:59,190 --> 00:58:59,650
Is it refreshing?

735
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:00,620
Yes.

736
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:05,860
Wow, it tastes good.

737
00:59:08,690 --> 00:59:12,610
Oh yes, let's see here.

738
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:15,080
Thank you for this.

739
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,340
Go on and rest.

740
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,890
Yes ma'am.

741
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:40,510
I can't live with her.

742
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:45,570
If she stays in this house,
everything will blow up in our faces.

743
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,100
What should we do now?

744
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:50,730
Mother-in-law,

745
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,170
now,

746
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:56,140
there's only that option left.

747
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,950
I feel so refreshed.

748
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:06,560
Oh my! I completely forgot to buy the meat.

749
01:00:06,590 --> 01:00:10,290
I'll only be a second in buying it the meat that you love.

750
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:12,910
Okay.

751
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:46,810
Is anyone here?

752
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,250
Did someone come?

753
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,320
Who's there?

754
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:06,000
Oh! Why have you come?

755
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,090
The in-laws...

756
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:15,500
have something they wanted to tell you,
which is why I've come.

757
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,500
To me?

758
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:19,250
Yes.

764
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:46,280
<i>Hey!</i>

765
01:01:46,290 --> 01:01:47,850
<i>You're the one who did the surrogacy though.</i>

766
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,300
<i>Sister-in-law was the one who gave birth to Yoo Bin.</i>

767
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,630
<i>You mean, you told the in-laws that?</i>

768
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,700
<i>Were we supposed to let Sister-in-law
and Brother-in-law stay together?</i>

769
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:59,160
I want to take a bath and water gun fight with you, Aunt!

770
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:02,920
<i>How lonely were you with that child by yourself?</i>

771
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:04,930
<i>Eun Nim was given money to give birth to that child.</i>

772
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:05,990
<i>Is that really true?!</i>

773
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,160
<i>She did it to save you! To save you!</i>

774
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:11,470
<i>Just give our Eun Nim a chance.</i>

775
01:02:11,490 --> 01:02:13,420
<i>She did it to save her father!</i>

776
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:15,910
<i>Sister-in-law's boldness has a motive behind it.</i>

777
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:18,480
<i>I can't do that, Sister-in-law.</i>

778
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:22,740
<i>Whatever results come out of this,
don't forget it's all your fault, Sister-in-law.</i>
