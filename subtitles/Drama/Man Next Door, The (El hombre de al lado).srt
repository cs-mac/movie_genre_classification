{44916}{45002}And now for the final task|of your training.
{45106}{45175}You're gonna need a harder piece|of wood than that, cowboy.
{45209}{45276}-That's not her.|-Yeah, it is.
{45496}{45559}-Oh, no.|-Oh, yeah.
{45786}{45856}Matt! Matt! Dude, you're|missing the best part.
{45918}{45957}Fuck! Fuck!
{46009}{46048}Settle down, tiger.|I know. I know.
{46053}{46103}It's not funny.|Seriously, get away from me.
{46108}{46165}-Dude, don't mess this up.|-Mess what up?
{46170}{46208}Matt, she's a porn star,|okay?
{46216}{46280}Take her to a motel room|and bang her like a beast.
{46288}{46328}Eli, I like this girl.
{46333}{46400}And you can still like her|with your penis inside her.
{46415}{46467}I'm telling you,|you're gonna regret this.
{46472}{46525}What would JFK do?|You know he'd tap that ass.
{46530}{46578}Eli, I'm never gonna|see her again.
{46582}{46611}Oh, you know what? Fine.
{46616}{46650}-Fine.|-Fine!
{46669}{46698}Goddamn it, Matt.
{46700}{46774}I swear to God, if you don't|fuck her, I'll kill myself!
{46779}{46921}Matt, please. Please, Matt.|Fuck her for me. For me!
{47208}{47268}-Oh, Marci, you're so funny.|-Oh, thanks.
{47343}{47402}-I just saw you naked.|-What?
{47410}{47467}Don't worry, honey,|you were only 2 days old.
{47474}{47525}-Let's see what else we have.|-Why are you here?
{47530}{47563}I just came here to say hi.
{47587}{47625}Hi.
{47630}{47666}Look at this one of him.
{47877}{47916}Hey, buddy.
{47930}{47999}-That one's the best.|-It is. He looks so adorable.
{48004}{48055}He looks really--|Oh, that's such a good one.
{48059}{48124}-Here you go, Danielle.|-Oh, thanks.
{48314}{48369}-Thattagirl.|-This is a cute one.
{48373}{48417}Oh, who's your daddy?
{48429}{48505}So you were going to school|in Los Angeles?
{48510}{48577}For a while. But then I started|working on other things.
{48582}{48635}Oh, what kind of things?
{48688}{48719}Let me show you.
{48942}{48973}Jesus!
{49083}{49141}-Are you okay?|-Yeah, I don't know, I....
{49157}{49196}I don't feel so good.
{49309}{49368}What can I do to make you|feel better?
{49728}{49771}I think I'm feeling|a lot better now.
{49776}{49848}-We can go out another night.|-No, we're going out tonight.
{49860}{49918}-You sure?|-Positive.
{50013}{50081}-I don't know if I can do this.|-Yes, you can.
{50085}{50152}But tonight, be the man.
{50167}{50241}First off, act like|you don't even like her.
{50246}{50308}-Hey.|-Hey.
{50313}{50423}Second, get her drunk.|Really drunk, okay?
{50431}{50491}That way the true porn star|will come out in her.
{50572}{50654}Here, I... I got us something.
{50728}{50776}Bourbon?
{50781}{50860}-Are you trying to get me drunk?|-No, what?
{50865}{50958}-I thought you like to rock.|-"Like to rock?"
{50972}{51032}Last and most important...
{51040}{51092}...always be touching her,|Matt.
{51097}{51159}That tells her you came here|to get down tonight.
{51251}{51299}What are we doing?
{51327}{51373}Just chilling.
{51471}{51517}Hey, look.
{51529}{51560}MOTEL|Glen Capri

{52907}{52948}What?
{52960}{53037}-What are you thinking?|-What are you thinking?
{53109}{53140}I don't know.
{53387}{53425}Do you wanna fuck me?
{53607}{53658}Come here.
{54073}{54111}How do you want me?
{54152}{54188}Why are you doing this?
{54216}{54257}What?
{54272}{54312}This.
{54355}{54415}Isn't this what you want?
{54425}{54497}To fuck a porn star|in a cheap motel room?
{54617}{54679}So this is what|you think of me.
{54737}{54785}-Danielle, wait. I'm sorry.|-Let me guess.
{54789}{54828}You saw a tape,|and you thought:
{54833}{54888}"What the hell?|She does it for a living, right?"
{54893}{54972}-Eli told me to do it.|-Oh, now that's a mature response.
{54976}{55053}-Why didn't you just tell me?|-Because I didn't want to, okay?
{55125}{55192}Because I loved the way|you looked at me.
{55228}{55307}God, do you have|any idea how--?
{55341}{55377}Forget it.
{55384}{55466}-Hold on.|-Fuck you.
{55808}{55856}ONLY 9 DAYS LEFT!|SAMNANG

{56168}{56199}WHY DO I DESERVE|THIS SCHOLARSHIP?
{56602}{56736}Look, I'm an idiot, okay?|I saw the tape, and I freaked out.
{56741}{56808}Hi. I'm coming in.|Can I come in?
{56842}{56890}Look, I've just|been crazy lately.
{56895}{56976}I mean, the whole scholarship|thing, you know, I mean....
{56981}{57019}It's killing me, you know?
{57026}{57091}But I'm not even|thinking about that.
{57098}{57201}The only thing I care about|is you, you know?
{57206}{57269}All I want is just for us|to go back to normal again.
{57273}{57348}It's a real nice place|you got here, D.

{60357}{60393}So, what grade are|you in, man?

{62009}{62049}-What are you doing?|-What?
{62054}{62090}Here.
{62129}{62181}And you turn it like so:
{62339}{62440}-Hey, where are you going?|-The bathroom. Is that okay?

{63097}{63155}Oh, my God.|That's Mr. Peterson.
{63159}{64624}That's my dad's|friend.
{63188}{63239}He comes over all|the time with his wife.
{63253}{63282}Really?
{63291}{63311}Hey, Peterson.
{63313}{63392}What? Dude,|what are you doing, man?
{63397}{63457}Yeah, you. Get over here.
{63466}{63565}Goddamn, Peterson, haven't|seen your black ass in ages.
{63569}{63644}-Do I know you?|-What the fuck's your problem?
{63651}{63733}-I....|-Just fucking with you, man.
{63752}{63821}Hey, you know my friend|Matty here, right?
{63932}{64044}-Matthew. Hi.|-Peterson, this is Matty's first time.

{64382}{64430}No, big dinner's on Thursday.
{64529}{64629}So, what's it for again?
{64634}{64684}The scholarship.

{64766}{64816}...moral fiber.
{64883}{64953}Me? A Teenage Daddy?
{64958}{65018}Who is this guy?|Is he a porn producer?
{65020}{65070}Klitz, shut up.|Now, the strippers.
{65075}{65154}When you get a lap dance, were they|cool with you grabbing their ass?
{65159}{65209}Dude. I'm trying to talk|about Danielle here.
{65214}{65277}Fine. Selfish bitch.
{65281}{65375}For teenagers, sexual intercourse|can be dangerous.
{65380}{65418}Jesus, what hack made this?
{65425}{65492}I could make a better sex-ed|film with my mom.
{65497}{65540}Why don't they update this thing?
{65547}{65600}Special events,|such as your senior prom...
{65605}{65679}...place added pressure on young|teens to lose their virginity...
{65687}{65744}...and also engage|in unprotected sex.
{65751}{65792}9 months later...
{65830}{65874}-Hello?|-Hey, Bob.

{66590}{66631}-You girls are 18, right?|-I am.
{66636}{66684}-I will be in a month.|-Really?
{66691}{66746}-You ever been photographed?|-A couple of times.
{66751}{66809}Hey, you guys know Matty?
{66813}{66883}I hung with him last night.|Guy's the tits.

{67746}{67796}-Hold on a sec.|-Where are you guys going?
{67801}{67852}-We got things to do.|-Do you wanna hang out?
{67856}{67947}-Hop in, fellas.|-Aren't you gonna photograph us?
{68017}{68060}Always leave|them wanting more.
{68065}{68108}Punch it!
{68485}{68564}Man, there is|some talent here.
{68580}{68650}You get those girls together|with those ass-bags there...
{68655}{68710}...shoot them humping at,|like, a football...
{68712}{68770}...game or at a prom,|that video would sell.
{68775}{68823}Fuck, I'm good!
{68830}{68928}How do I get these ideas?|It's like a gift, you know?
{68933}{68969}It's like I can't control it.
{69065}{69151}So, what are we doing, man?
{69245}{69300}You know, you really didn't|have to come with me.
{69305}{69393}It's cool.|I like running errands.
{69424}{69504}So you raised 25 G's just|to bring this Chinese guy over.
{69508}{69561}No, he's Cambodian.
{69568}{69652}Okay, so that's 25,000|total deposited...
{69657}{69719}...into the Operation|Get Samnang account.

{69789}{69827}-Congratulations.|-Thanks.
{69832}{69885}So is this Samnang|really as smart as they say?
{69890}{69957}Well, he did teach himself|calculus without even using...
{69959}{69995}..his textbooks, so....
{70000}{70093}Those crazy little fuckers, man.|They sure know their numbers.
{70156}{70242}Jeannie, this is my--|This is my student advisor.
{70223}{70544}They really compliment|your coloring.
{70259}{70304}Oh, you're Mr. Salinger?
{70314}{70395}Just here to make sure|everything's up to par. Wow.
{70403}{70472}-What?|-I love those earrings.

{71419}{71489}So that's it?|You're just going back?
{71494}{71541}I don't belong here.
{71546}{71633}What do you--? What do you mean?|What about starting over?
{71647}{71681}This is what I am.
{71767}{71834}All right, D, let's roll.
{72263}{72349}-Dude, it's not your fault.|-No, it is my fault.
{72361}{72436}If I hadn't been such a dick and|taken her to that motel room....
{72441}{72498}Yeah, it was a little forward,|don't you think?
{72525}{72560}-Dude.|-What?
{72568}{72630}Matt, the point is,|she made her decision.
{72642}{72700}There's nothing|you can do about it now.

{84477}{84527}-Dude, wait up.|-Fuck you, dude!
{84709}{84733}Excuse me.
{84735}{84812}I just wanna let you know,|I know who you really are.
{84875}{84939}And you're better than this.
{85829}{85874}IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY DREAM....
{85901}{85949}Yeah?
{86124}{86157}Need a ride to school?
{86263}{86351}It's all you now. I mean,|now you can do whatever you want.
{86380}{86423}Why do you believe|in me so much?
{86445}{86493}I don't know. Maybe I'm stupid.
{86608}{86697}-Good luck tonight.|-Thanks.
{86721}{86778}-Bye.|-Bye.
{87157}{87195}Will you go to prom with me?
{87258}{87294}What?
{87423}{87478}I would love to.
{87560}{87639}Now for the scientific|explanation. Anybody?
{87644}{87687}JOHN F. KENNEDY once said:|ASK NOT....
{87744}{87797}That's your speech?
{87816}{87857}Yeah.
{87869}{87919}You ready for tonight?
{87948}{88001}Hey, don't worry, man.|You're gonna be great.
{88013}{88056}I have to be.
{88353}{88397}That bitch can't just|run away because...
{88399}{88442}...she don't wanna fuck|on film anymore.
{88447}{88488}May I help you?
{88533}{88593}-Get up.|-Okay, okay.
{88797}{88850}Stay in school.
{88938}{89006}Look, I have the most important|dinner of my life tonight...
{89010}{89046}...so wherever we're going,|you know...
{89049}{89094}...we just have to be|home by 6.
{89099}{89152}Just so you know.
{89195}{89253}Here he comes.
{89301}{89363}-It's a cool ride, huh?|-Yeah, if you're a fag.
{89368}{89442}-Jesus!|-It's cool, it's cool.
{89456}{89490}Get in.
{89782}{89850}-Where are we going?|-I thought you were cool, man.
{89854}{89905}I tried to be your friend,|and what do you do?
{89909}{89950}-You fuck me.|-I didn't fuck you.
{89955}{90015}She didn't show up on set|because of what you said.
{90020}{90056}Now I'm out 30 grand.
{90089}{90183}-Guess who's paying me back.|-What? I don't have 30 grand.
{90188}{90255}-Get your folks to help.|-They don't have that kind of money.
{90260}{90399}Look, Kelly, I'm a problem solver,|all right? This is what I do. Okay?
{90403}{90502}Let's just-- Let's just think|outside of the box here.
{90514}{90566}Look, she'll get a job,|I'll keep mowing...
{90569}{90631}...lawns, and over time|we'll pay it down.
{90636}{90701}You know? This can work.|We can do this.
{90706}{90763}It'll be like a payment plan.
{90945}{91015}-You really care about her, huh?|-Yeah, I really do.
{91020}{91104}Yeah, I don't know. If I'm gonna|do this payment-plan thing...
{91108}{91163}...I need a show of good faith,|you know?
{91168}{91252}-Something concrete.|-Well, like what?
{91305}{91336}A blowjob.
{91391}{91446}No. I told you she's not gonna|do that anymore.
{91468}{91516}Who said anything about her?
{91605}{91701}Yeah, we're definitely|outside the box now, huh?
{91720}{91828}Now, you gotta ask yourself,|how far are you willing to go?
{91883}{91945}How much do you|really care about her?
{92070}{92108}I'm joking, man.
{92173}{92204}Relax.
{92245}{92314}-Damn. Do I look gay to you?|-No, but, Jesus--
{92513}{92540}You wanna be president?
{92542}{92600}Let me tell you the first|rule of politics:
{92604}{92707}Always know if the juice|is worth the squeeze.
{92712}{92784}You know what that means?|It means you don't steal my girl...
{92789}{92847}...unless you're ready|to accept the consequences.
{92986}{93038}All right, I'm sorry, okay?
{93110}{93180}That's gonna swell up like|a bitch. Here, take this.
{93283}{93340}I'm telling you,|it's gonna hurt like shit.
{93489}{93633}I'm sorry I got upset.|I felt taken advantage of.
{93645}{93729}Look, I'm not gonna be a dick.|I know she loves you.
{93736}{93789}I'm gonna leave you guys alone.
{93791}{93844}But now you're doing|something for me.
{94098}{94160}Remember that ass-bag, Hugo,|from the convention?
{94168}{94220}We used to be partners|a long time ago.
{94228}{94297}One day, I had this killer|idea to make films set...
{94300}{94321}...in real-life situations.
{94328}{94400}You know, Real World porn.
{94407}{94477}I told the idea to Hugo.|He says he'll think about it.
{94482}{94530}And what does|that motherfucker do?
{94537}{94621}Takes my best girl, starts|his own company with my idea...
{94626}{94683}...and the guy makes millions.
{94688}{94717}It's not the money|that pisses me off.
{94719}{94772}I mean, fuck,|it does piss me off...
{94777}{94825}...but that's not it.|It's the perception.
{94829}{94897}Everybody thinks Hugo's|the genius. It was my idea.
{94901}{94992}It's like he's Simon,|and I'm Garfunkel.
{95012}{95115}Look at me, man.|I'm fucking Garfunkel.
{95187}{95309}-Look, seriously, I can't do this.|-Don't be a pussy. Nobody's home.
{95429}{95510}-Why do you want this thing so bad?|-Because it should've been mine.
{95517}{95573}-I'll grab it and leave.|-You don't understand...
{95577}{95623}...l have to be at|a dinner in an hour.
{95625}{95671}My whole life depends on it.
{95676}{95716}You want me out|of Danielle's life?
{95719}{95750}Yes, I do.
{95755}{95815}-Then let's go.|-But wait, seriously.
{95820}{95870}Sometimes, if you wanna do|something good...
{95875}{95920}...you gotta do|something bad.
{95923}{95980}Yeah, but this is breaking|and entering.
{95985}{96043}This is politics.
{96148}{96182}Hey.
{96186}{96254}After this, we're cool, okay?
{96306}{96364}You're all right, man.
{97030}{97071}Yes.
{97078}{97119}I'd like to report a robbery.
{97344}{97397}AVN BEST PICTURE 1999|"CHITTY CHITTY GANG BANG"

{97973}{98035}Help! Oh, fuck!
{98145}{98186}Wait!
{98191}{98224}Come on!
{98680}{98728}Okay, so what time|does the dinner start?
{98733}{98764}Six o'clock.
{98769}{98838}-Why? What time is it now?|-6:30.
{98845}{98900}-Oh, my God.|-Dude, don't worry, all right?
{98905}{98960}We'll get there.|You know what? Try and--
{98965}{99056}-Dude, what are you doing?|-I don't know. I just...
{99080}{99126}...feel so good.
{99337}{99385}Oh, my God.
{99423}{99474}I just feel so weird.
{99478}{99533}Don't worry.|Ecstasy is not that bad.
{99541}{99610}-What?|-Kelly likes dosing people with E.
{99637}{99697}Oh, my God. Am I gonna die?
{99701}{99797}No, no, no. It's okay, Matt.|You're gonna be fine. I promise.
{99804}{99891}You're such a good friend, Klitzy.|I love you.
{99898}{99948}I love you so much.
{99982}{100027}This is gonna be amazing.
{100061}{100106}Wait a second.
{100111}{100157}Oh, my God.
{100162}{100210}WELCOME TO THE SHERIDAN|SCHOLARSHIP BANQUET
{100270}{100332}You don't understand. It's|really kicking in right now.
{100337}{100389}Just try not to talk|so much, okay?
{100392}{100437}Talk so much?|I'm giving a speech.
{100442}{100493}-It's okay. Just go with it.|-Wait, wait.
{100497}{100519}In a few minutes, we'll begin|the speeches, and we hope....
{100763}{100804}Thank you again|for coming to what...
{100807}{100876}...promises to be a|very eventful evening.
{100938}{100977}Matthew Kidman?
{101080}{101111}My competition.
{101116}{101195}-Hey, what's up, Ryan?|-Jesus, what happened to you?
{101200}{101260}Just living life, my man.
{101265}{101312}Mina, how are you?
{101317}{101363}Okay. Just a little nervous.
{101368}{101423}But you're a little temptress,|though, aren't you?
{101600}{101641}Hey, buddy. How you doing?
{101646}{101718}Hey. Thanks a lot,|thanks a lot.
{102298}{102355}Hey, there's the big daddy.
{102360}{102423}Matthew, what has been|going on with you?
{102427}{102468}Some serious shit.
{102475}{102542}But, Jesus, man,|it's good to see you.
{102550}{102605}Will you excuse us, please?
{102646}{102677}Oh, my God.|Am I blowing it?
{102682}{102725}Just try and control yourself.
{102729}{102809}-Just breathe, okay?|-All right.
{102926}{102986}I have learned a lot|from my teachers.
{103012}{103094}But my best teacher|has always been my mother...
{103099}{103163}...a woman who worked three|jobs trying to support me...
{103168}{103219}...ever since|I was a little niña.
{103226}{103295}I will never forget the day|she said to me:
{103374}{103439}And that is why I have always|tried to answer the call...
{103444}{103485}...of the great|John F. Kennedy...
{103490}{103576}...who urged us to|"Ask not what your country"--
{103806}{103852}Let's see here....
{103856}{103909}I can't speak a|foreign language...
{103914}{103945}...so that's out.
{103952}{104043}And I-- I certainly|can't quote J.F.K. now...
{104048}{104108}...can I, Ryan? You know what?
{104115}{104187}It's funny, I have this whole|speech prepared...
{104192}{104252}...and I've been|practicing for weeks...
{104259}{104302}...but you know what?
{104307}{104343}I'm just gonna go with it.
{104417}{104480}Moral fiber.
{104485}{104547}So, what is moral fiber?|I mean....
{104552}{104633}It's funny, I used to think|it was always telling the truth...
{104638}{104676}...doing good deeds.
{104681}{104739}You know, basically|being a fucking Boy Scout.
{104784}{104839}But lately, I've been seeing|it differently.
{104875}{104921}Now I think that moral|fiber's about...
{104926}{104981}...finding that one thing|you really care about.
{105010}{105046}That one special thing|that means more...
{105048}{105105}...to you than anything|else in the world.
{105149}{105180}And when you find her...
{105211}{105288}...you fight for her.|You risk it all.
{105302}{105393}...your future, your life...
{105302}{105393}You put her in front of|everything...
{105398}{105436}...all of it.
{105458}{105547}And maybe the stuff you do|to help her isn't so clean.
{105563}{105604}You know what?|It doesn't matter.
{105659}{105710}Because in your|heart you know...
{105731}{105779}...that the juice|is worth the squeeze.
{105842}{105897}That's what moral|fiber's all about.
{106465}{106532}First, I'd just like to commend|the candidates on...
{106534}{106587}...their impressive remarks.
{106614}{106690}This year was a|very tough decision.
{106700}{106803}And as much as we'd love to give|you all scholarships, we can't.
{106813}{106892}And so I am proud to announce|the winner...
{106896}{106947}...of this year's|Sheridan scholarship:
{107076}{107141}Ryan Winger.
{108119}{108162}Oh, God, what happened?
{108189}{108230}Yeah, I slipped.
{108234}{108297}Listen, Jeannie,|Samnang's coming on Monday.
{108301}{108359}-I know. How exciting.|-Yeah.
{108364}{108412}So I'm gonna need|to close out the account.
{108417}{108455}What do you mean?
{108460}{108520}I mean I'm gonna need|to close out the account.
{108524}{108592}-But it's already closed.|-What are you talking about?
{108599}{108668}Your teacher came by yesterday|and cleared out the account.
{108673}{108704}Who? What-- What teacher?
{108711}{108750}Your student advisor.|Mr. Salinger.
{108752}{108798}The one you were|with the other day.
{108805}{108884}Mr. Salinger? What are you--?
{109121}{109174}Cambodia
{109181}{109241}Samnang, what's wrong, my son?
{109251}{109301}That Matthew Kidman.
{109306}{109428}He fucked me, Mom.|He fucked me so bad.
{109433}{109472}Son of a bitch.
{109551}{109582}Oh, my God.
{109594}{109632}-What's wrong?|-Jeannie...
{109656}{109697}...didn't you ask|for ID or anything?
{109723}{109793}You said he was|your student advisor.
{109795}{109826}Oh, my God.
{109882}{109937}-Jeannie, where are you going?|-To get the manager.
{109944}{109980}No, hold on.|Wait, wait, wait.
{110004}{110035}Matthew, what's going on?
{110047}{110088}Look...
{110107}{110157}...that guy wasn't|my student advisor.
{110188}{110260}No, I know, I know.|I can get the money back.
{110265}{110354}We just need to keep this|between me and you for now, okay?
{110368}{110445}That's a great blouse, by the way.|Have you lost weight?
{110452}{110495}No? No, wait, wait.
{110524}{110553}Jeannie.
{110591}{110661}You think about this.|This is your fault too. Right?
{110668}{110728}You didn't ask for ID.|You didn't do anything.
{110733}{110781}And I saw you flirting|with him too...
{110783}{110809}...all right?|So unprofessional.
{110814}{110860}You'll lose your job|over this.
{110862}{110893}Don't threaten me,|you little shit.
{110898}{110944}I could give a fuck about you|and your rice boy.
{110946}{110980}I'm not getting fired.
{110984}{111054}Okay, okay. I'm sorry.|Just-- Please, I....
{111059}{111111}Just-- No one can ever|find out about this.
{111116}{111183}If this gets out, I'll be expelled.|My life will be over.
{111188}{111231}If that money isn't|back by Monday...
{111234}{111282}...I wouldn't worry about|being expelled.
{111287}{111325}I'd worry about going to jail.
{111380}{111416}-Jeannie....|-Hi, Jeannie.
{111421}{111464}Hi, Martin.
{111696}{111728}BANK MANAGER
{112147}{112195}Matthew, what's wrong?
{112202}{112289}Matt, is there something|you want to talk about?
{112303}{112368}Matthew, honey, what is it?
{112533}{112608}-Hi.|-Come here.
{112785}{112838}I'm in so much trouble.
{113142}{113217}I can't believe|we're even thinking about this.
{113288}{113356}Well, if you need that kind|of money by Monday....
{113375}{113411}Yeah-- What are we doing?
{113413}{113456}I mean, I can't get you|involved in this.
{113464}{113507}I want to do it.
{113516}{113555}Why?
{113603}{113651}Moral fiber.
{113701}{113713}I'm in.
{113715}{113758}You haven't heard|the whole plan yet.
{113763}{113794}Doesn't matter.
{113799}{113845}Fuck film school.
{113850}{113936}This is gonna be huge.|This is gonna be my calling card.
{113974}{114020}-No.|-Klitzy....
{114025}{114068}-No way.|-Klitz...

{141381}{141456}...would you mind joining me|in the living room for a second?
{141460}{141496}Great.
{141674}{141760}Matthew, is there anything you want|to say before we watch this?
{141854}{141904}Okay, then. On with the show.
{141988}{142038}Hello. I'm April.
{142043}{142081}And I'm Ferrari.
{142086}{142172}You may recognize us as stars of|the adult entertainment industry.
{142180}{142232}And today we're taking time|out to talk about...
{142235}{142275}...a very important subject.
{142280}{142316}-Sex.|-Sex.
{142345}{142400}Special events|such as senior prom...
{142405}{142431}...place added pressure|on young teens...
{142436}{142508}...to lose their virginity|and engage in unprotected sex.
{142513}{142570}I know I lost my virginity|at my senior...
{142573}{142618}...prom. When'd you|lose yours, April?
{142623}{142695}-When I was 10.|-Moving on.
{142700}{142760}In this video,|we'll go through.
{142762}{142798}...everything from kissing|to foreplay.
{142803}{142894}And for our finale, we'll show you|how to put a condom on properly...
{142899}{142952}...using a real person.
{142954}{143016}No cucumbers or bananas|in this video.
{143021}{143071}So for those of you|naughty boys...
{143074}{143115}...expecting to see a|raunchy porn video...
{143124}{143199}...you might as well|turn this off now...
{143203}{143244}...because you're not|gonna see sex.
{143249}{143285}What the fuck is this shit?
{143290}{143357}You're gonna see sex education.
{143410}{143448}The ELI EXPERIENCE|presents
{143481}{143558}ADULT EDUCATION|Sex Education for the 21st Century
{143633}{143680}This is interesting, Matthew.
{143764}{143796}Yeah.
{143800}{143858}Yeah, I think it's|a great idea.
{143939}{144019}Well, you remember those|sex-ed films back in our day.
{144033}{144112}Well, I'll tell you, if|they were anything like this...
{144117}{144191}...we sure would've paid|more attention, don't you think?
{144232}{144285}I think it's atrocious.
{144357}{144388}But...
{144393}{144436}...the hell with it.
{144467}{144522}The kids today|are so goddamn screwed up...
{144527}{144599}...maybe this is the only way|you can reach them.
{144671}{144726}You just might|have something here, Matthew.
{144740}{144783}I think it's pretty wild.
{144812}{144860}This could really sell,|don't you think?
{144894}{144946}How'd you come up|with such an idea, Matthew?
{144982}{145014}What can I say?
{145047}{145097}It's like a gift, you know?
{145119}{145169}It's like I can't control it.

{146313}{146387}See, Hugo Posh isn't just tits.|He isn't just ass.

{146905}{146946}So who is this silent partner?
{146980}{147051}Well, he prefers to remain|anonymous.
{147234}{147306}You better cure cancer, kid.
{147310}{147349}The next Einstein.
{147358}{147404}All right.|Yeah, next question.
