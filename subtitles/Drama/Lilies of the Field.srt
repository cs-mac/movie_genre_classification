1
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,099
My car's thirsty.
Can I please have some water?

2
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,259
God is good.
He has sent me a big, strong man.

3
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,497
He didn't say anything to me about it.
I was just passing.

4
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:38,134
But you did not pass.

5
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,851
That is your... your car?

6
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,380
That's my home.

7
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,570
You fix und dann habe ich...

8
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:56,169
I have something you do.

9
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,135
I thank you very kindly, ma'am, but
I got places to go. Thanks for the water.

10
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:41,539
If it's for hire,
you got yourself one man for one day.

11
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,175
- Hire?
- You want me to work for you?

12
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,578
For hire means for money. I could build
a better fence than your girls.

13
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:54,216
Schwester Gertrude. Schwester Albertine.
Schwester Elizabeth. Schwester Agnes.

14
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,729
I am Mother Maria.

15
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,331
Pleased to meet you all. You've got a nice
family, ma'am. My name is Homer Smith.

16
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,338
- Homer...?
- Homer Schmidt.

17
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,416
Oh, Schmidt!

18
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:13,049
Herr Schmidt, no fence.
We do that ourselves.

19
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,296
Up there. The roof.

20
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,152
You fix?

21
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:37,731
It couldn't be leaking
on a day like this.

22
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,215
- Roof only leaks when it rains.
- Was?

23
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,331
I'm only kidding. I'll fix it good.

24
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:48,170
- You use this.
- No, thanks. I've got my own.

25
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:06,135
Can't do good work without good tools
and if you hire me, you get good work.

26
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,216
Hire.

27
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,368
Schwester, das Bett in die Scheune.

28
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,615
- What's that?
- The bed you sleep.

29
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,096
- No. I got my own arrangements.
- You sleep in here?

30
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,656
Schwester, tragen Sie die Sachen zurück
ins Haus. Schmidt schläft in seinem Auto.

31
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,214
No, no, you got it just a little bit wrong.

32
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,776
The job is finished,
so you pay me and I take off.

33
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,334
- Take off?
- Thatta way.

34
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,258
You have such a hurry?

35
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,579
I'm hungry. I figured I'd find me a chilli
wagon and log another hundred miles.

36
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,773
We were not put on the earth
to hurry, Schmidt.

37
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,175
For supper, I ring the bell.

38
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,338
Schmidt!

39
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,454
Jesu Christ, sei unser Gast und segne,
was du bescheret hast.

40
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,411
Amen.

41
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,736
Himmlischer Vater...

42
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:35,419
Möge das Essen, das du uns gibst,

43
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,011
Homer Schmidt stark machen,
damit er deinen Willen erfüllen kann.

44
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,015
- Amen.
- Amen.

45
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,855
Himmlischer Vater,
wir danken dir für deinen Segen.

46
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,289
- Amen.
- Amen.

47
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:16,448
- You folks really eating off the land.
- Was?

48
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,855
Er sagt, wir leben
von den Früchten des Landes.

49
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,936
Oh, ja! Ja!

50
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,451
God sets a mighty poor table.

51
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,572
Soon we will have vegetables too.

52
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,896
And sometimes chicken.

53
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,736
- Well...
- You smoke?

54
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,738
- Yes, ma'am.
- You smoke is all right.

55
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,175
- I think I'd better be rolling.
- Do not make hurry.

56
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,538
We are from Germany,
from Austria and from Hungary.

57
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,049
We learn English.

58
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:05,019
Bitte senden Sie
den Diener auf mein Zimmer.

59
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:08,815

71
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,730
I could speak English for you.

72
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,972
Warten Sie, Schwester.
Schmidt wird mit uns Englisch sprechen.

73
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,534
Oh, ja!

74
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,811
Sure. Anything you want to know,
just name it.

75
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:05,489
Fragen Sie ihn, was Sie wissen wollen.

00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,449

Die anderen arbeiten schon seit Stunden
und Sie liegen da und schlafen!

120
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,173
Jetzt tummeln Sie sich aber
und machen schnell!

121
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,098
You hold on one minute.

122
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,371
You just hold on one minute.

123
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,618
I ain't no nun.
I'm nobody you can boss around. See?

124
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:02,289
I get up when I feel like getting up
and if I don't wanna work, I don't.

125
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,732
Now if you just pay me, I'll be gone.

126
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:10,409
You go? No. You go eat now.

- I'll get my own chow.
- Eat!

128
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,215
What are you doing in here?

129
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:30,377
How come she ain't got you
digging ditches and chopping wood

130
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,456
and moving mountains?

131
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,777
Please... you slow talk?

132
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,496
I'm sorry.

133
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:45,409
That old lady has got a mean streak.

134
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:51,092
People have got to sleep. People
have got to have some joy in living.

135
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,654
People gotta...

136
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,532
eat.

137
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,695
That's a Catholic breakfast.

138
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,976
One egg.

139
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,855
That old lady don't hand out grub like
she hands out orders. Can I have coffee?

140
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,972
Coffee? Nein.

141
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,091
Ve no coffee.

142
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,936
- Schmidt.
- Mama.

143
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,019
We ought to get this straightened out.
I'll deduct for the dinner...

144
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,973
- And what you call breakfast.
- Come! Follow me.

145
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,773
- We build a shapel.
- It's very nice. What's a "shapel"?

146
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,017
Eine kleine Kirche. A cha... pel.

147
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,816
- Ve build a chapel right here.
- Who's "ve"?

148
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,532
You.

149
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,013
Lots of luck. I ain't
building no "shapel".

150
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:40,053
Ja, you.

151
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:45,254
Not only am I ain't building no "shapel",
I'm taking off! I ain't no contractor.

152
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,450
- That is for the beginning.
- No.

153
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,651
- I don't need all that work. No.
- No? All right.

154
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,169
- All right.
- We build it. We women.

155
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,576
- You do that little thing.
- We will. It's God's will.

156
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,975
Boy. Look, I'm checking out.

157
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,740
All right. I'll clean
out some of that stuff.

158
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,533
I don't want those girls
to break their backs.

159
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,539
Just to work off that tremendous breakfast
you fed me this morning.

160
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,378
- Let's settle up.
- Ja, sind Sie denn nicht zufrieden?

161
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,412
Wenn wir das gewusst hätten, hätten wir
Ihnen das Frühstück ans Bett gebracht.

162
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,576
I hope you're not talking mean to me.

163
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,693
You wanted your breakfast in bed?
You talk like American millionaire!

164
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:29,288
- Yeah. That's me. A millionaire.
- Ja!

165
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,452
Wall Street!

166
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,533
"Us women, ve will build a chapel!"

167
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,292
Schmidt!

168
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,295
Schmidt!

169
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,220
Old Mother gonna feed the slave?

170
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,212
Jesu Christ, sei unser Gast...

171
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,695
bescheret hast.

172
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,776
- Amen.
- Amen.

173
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,213
I milked the cow yesterday.

174
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,889
I milk the cow today.

175
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,569
I milk the cow tomorrow.

176
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,168
Very good. Very good.

177
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,689
- Very good, Schwester Elizabeth.
- Danke schön.

178
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,699
"Thank you." Thank you.
Danke schön. Thank you.

179
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,938
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

180
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,296
- Thank you.
- Beautiful.

181
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,698
Now you try it, Mama. "Thank you."

182
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,136
It's time.

183
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,216
- Good night.
- Good night.

184
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,851
- Good night, Sister Elizabeth.
- Good night.

185
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,971
Good night, Sister Albertine.

186
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:22,730
Sister Agnes, you be up early.
You've got to milk that poor old cow.

187
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,738
I milk the poor old cow.

188
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,334
You like to make jokes, Schmidt?

189
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,291
This isn't exactly a joke.

190
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,412
Now I sit down.

191
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,770
I give you a bill.

192
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,051
You pay me for my services.

193
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:50,332
I've put in two good days here, Mother.
I'm for hire, remember? Hire.

194
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,735
I speak English not so good.

195
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,170
You want to take advantage
of a poor country boy like me?

196
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,450
OK.

197
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,730
OK. We'll play it your way.

198
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:11,138
Book of Luke, chapter ten, verse seven.

199
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:14,330
Your Bible is all in German.

200
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,534
I'll read it to you in English.

201
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:29,092
"And in the same house remain, eating
and drinking such things as they give,

202
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,293
for the labourer is worthy of his hire."

203
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:36,890
That's not exactly what I had in mind
but you get the idea.

204
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,492
What you got there? Proverbs 14.

205
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,973
"Cast in thy lot amongst us,
let us all have one purse..."

206
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,979
I am a poor man! I've got to work
for wages. I can't work for...

207
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,329
Matthew... chapter six.

208
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,248
Acht und zwanzig...

209
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:11,655
Two-eight-two-nine.

210
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,340
Matthew, chapter six, 28-29.

211
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:24,175
Schmidt, read it in English.

212
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,731
"Why take thee thought for raiment?"

213
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,940
"Consider the lilies of the field
and how they grow."

214
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,618
"They toil not, neither do they spin,"

215
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,698
yet I say unto you,
not even Solomon in all his glories

216
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,936
"was arrayed as one of these."

217
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,528
Consider the lilies.

218
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,488
- What's that?
- You go to bed.

219
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,329
Tomorrow Sunday is.
The mass in town is nine by the clock.

220
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,372
- I'm a Baptist. I don't go to mass.
- We go.

221
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,175
- How'd you get there before?
- We walk every Sunday. Now we got you.

222
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,860
Now dammit! You ain't got me!

223
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,335
- Good night, Schmidt.
- Get that straight!

224
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,690
- Schlafen Sie wohl.
- And cut that out.

225
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,776
Bless you, Schmidt.

226
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,540
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

227
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,332
Morning.

228
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,894
- No breakfast?
- Never before mass.

229
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,332
Oh.

230
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,053
You guys look nice - lean, but nice.

231
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,216
- Where's it at?
- Was, Schmidt?

232
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,138
The church.

233
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,332
- Yeah, but where's it at?
- Er will wissen, wo die Kirche ist.

234
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,857
- That's not fair.
- Over there, Schmidt.

235
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,453
- Now come.
- No.

236
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,491
I'm gonna wait in here for you.

237
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,694
- Are you the man?
- I am the man.

238
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,376
- Can I get me some breakfast?
- Name it.

239
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,650
- A real breakfast?
- Whatever you say.

240
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,613
Double OJ and squeeze it fresh.

241
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,653
So?

242
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:56,731
A stack of wheatcakes with lots
of melted butter... maple syrup.

243
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,330
And fry me three, four, five eggs
with a mess of sausages

244
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:06,419
and a mountain of white toast
with strawberry marmalade

245
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,259
and... keep the coffee coming.

246
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,449
- No beans?
- You got beans?

247
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,935
- The most, señor.
- Them too.

248
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,696
You take milk?

249
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:31,850
- I said fresh.
- I squeezed it myself this morning.

250
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,613
OK.

251
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,530
Very nice.

252
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:45,494
Very nice. Now...
melt some cheese over those beans.

253
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,497
- What's the matter you're not in church?
- I'm a Baptist.

254
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,090
- Why are you working for the sisters?
- I work for myself.

255
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,656
- How come you're not in church?
- I got a business.

256
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,853
- But you're a Catholic.
- No! I was born one, but...

257
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,059
- Father Murphy...
- What's the matter with him?

258
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,614
- He drinks.
- He's a priest.

259
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:11,538
- He's Irish.
- Oh.

260
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,416
Holy, holy, holy, hm?

261
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:21,169
You pray hard enough and your stomach
doesn't feel empty any more.

262
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:25,771
Praying does not pay the rent
and praying does not fill up the gas.

263
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,097
God ain't gonna get behind
this counter and sling hash.

264
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,654
Me? I gotta fill my wallet.

265
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,050
- Hey.
- What?

266
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:39,774
- They pay you?
- Sure.

267
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,176
I just wondered.
I heard they don't have a cent.

268
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,450
Not a cent.

269
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:48,652
Crazy trying to farm that land.
They aren't mean enough.

270
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,736
That old Mother, she'll do.

271
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,420
Oh-h-h!

272
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:57,578
Old Gus Ritter -
he used to own the place.

273
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:00,578
He could grow potatoes on bare rock.

274
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,772
He left the place
to this religious order in Germany.

275
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,609
East Germany. The sisters
came over the Wall. They tell you that?

276
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,219
- No. Like in Berlin?
- Sí.

277
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,539
Over the Wall, across the ocean,
across the country to what? This.

278
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,971
- They can't even talk the language.
- I've been straightening them out.

279
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,694
- Yeah?
- Sho'nuff!

280
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,695
Hey, listen. You ain't
gonna hang around with the sisters?

281
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,733
- Nah. I'm just passing through.
- That's right!

282
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,694
The sisters ask you something,
you tell them no. Keep right on going.

283
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,175
- That pie there?
- Sure.

284
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,417
- The whole one. Can I have it?
- It's gonna cost you.

285
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:49,373
Wrap it. I'm a millionaire.
From Wall Street.

286
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,651
- My name is Homer Smith.
- Juan Aquilito.

287
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,138
Schmidt!

288
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,213
Schmidt!

289
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:05,128
- Schmidt!
- Looks like you're being paged.

290
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,089
Das ist Schmidt.
Schmidt, Father Murphy.

291
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:23,495
Father Murphy will talk with you.

292
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,576
Pleased to meet you.

293
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:31,174
Cuidado con los velos. Deprisa.

294
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,894
Can we get out of this heat?

295
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,329
I didn't know Catholics
had outdoor meetings.

296
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,137
I got five other country clubs like this.
I cover about 400 miles a week.

297
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:49,414
Welcome to the poor man's Vatican.

298
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,973
Oh.

299
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,255
Mother Superior tells me
she believes God sent you to her.

300
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,532
No. I don't think he sent
a black Baptist to a Catholic nun!

301
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:06,696
That's what she tells me.

302
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,209
She also says
you're gonna build her a chapel.

303
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,854
She asked me.

304
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:17,177
But you know how it is.
I got other fish to fry.

305
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,451
She believes there was a need
and she put her trust in prayer.

306
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,976
When I was ordained, how I prayed.

307
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,299
How I prayed for a call to a great majestic
cathedral in some wealthy diocese.

308
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,492
I sent the message up in English,
in Latin, and he answered.

309
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,212
He answered.

310
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,495
I baptise them,
christen them, confirm them,

311
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:43,579
hear their confessions, give absolution,
last rites, bless their remains,

312
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,010
fill the tank, check the oil and water,
take off again and pray.

313
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,496
Pray that I don't blow out
one of those old tyres.

314
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,896
- You staying with the sisters?
- I'm just passing through.

315
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,136
Well, I think that's for the best.

316
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,415
- Sing another.
- Was sollen wir singen?

317
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,496
"Ave Maris Stella".

318
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:58,738
Ave Maris Stella

319
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,536
Dei mater alma

320
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:09,735
Atque semper virgo

321
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,978
Felix coeli porta

322
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:19,174
Amen

323
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,891
That's one you have to teach me.

324
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,808
- Now you sing.
- All right.

325
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,529
- What do you want to hear?
- We know Kirchen song only.

326
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,811
- Just sing, ja?
- All right.

327
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,691
Frankie and Johnny were lovers

328
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,895
Oh, Lordy, how they... could...

329
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,455
Erase that one.

330
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:55,018
Tell you what. I'll sing one of them
down home, go-to-meeting songs

331
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,256
and you join in with me, all right?

332
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:00,497
- All you have to sing is "Amen."
- Amen.

333
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,292
Nicht ah-men. Ay-men.

334
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,936
- Ay-men?
- Right. OK. Here we go.

335
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:10,132
Amen

336
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,093
Amen

337
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:15,211
Amen

338
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:20,334
Amen, amen... Now come on.

339
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,892
Amen

340
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,932
Amen

341
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,210
Amen

342
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,219
Amen, amen, Sing it over

343
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,173
Amen

344
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:39,098
Amen

345
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,450
Amen

346
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,334
- Amen, amen.
- See the baby

347
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,497
- Amen.
- Wrapped in a manger

348
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:51,453
- Amen.
- On Christmas morning

349
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:55,858
Amen, amen, amen

350
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,732
See him in the temple

351
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,738

00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,852

356
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:21,976

00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,016
- Amen, amen, amen.
- Led before Pilate

366
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:02,132
- Amen.
- Then they crucified him

367
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,172
- Amen.
- But he rose on Easter

368
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:11,455
- Amen, amen, amen.
- Hallelujah!

369
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:14,697
- Amen.
- He died to save us

370
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,698
- Amen.

371
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,929

372
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,938

00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:39,013
Amen

376
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,093
Schmidt!

377
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,695
Two times I call you for breakfast!

378
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,732
I heard you. You can keep
the cup of milk and the one egg.

379
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,614
You sucker me into breakfast, I'm
obliged to work. Not me. I'm cutting out.

380
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,298
Was?

381
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:01,095
This little soul is leaving the roost.
I'm heading thatta way.

382
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,336
- Thatta way?
- I'm leaving.

383
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,540
Schwester Gertrude, schnell!

384
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:11,096
Hurry up! Schmidt will
take us to Northfolk!

385
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,209
- You take us to Northfolk.
- You got bus fare?

386
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:17,979
- Back?
- We'll get back. Don't worry about us.

387
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,692
Amen!

388
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:59,528
Well... it's been interesting.
Not profitable, but interesting.

389
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,935
Schmidt, where do you go?

390
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,734
I don't know. West?

391
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,693
LA, San Francisco.
Maybe I'll swing on up to...

392
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:16,656
So... goodbye.

393
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,208
- Schwester Gertrude.
- Leben Sie wohl.

394
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,377
Hey, boy.

395
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:12,176
Are you Schmidt?

396
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,411
Well, that's what they call me.
My name is Homer Smith.

397
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:20,328
Are you the fellow who's supposed
to build a chapel? They must be kidding.

398
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,569
- Why?
- They tell me you're their contractor.

399
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,498
- So?
- Are you a contractor?

400
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,291
- What's wrong with that?
- Well, what kind of contractor?

401
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:38,734
Independent.

402
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,579
You local?
I don't remember doing business before.

403
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:46,091
- I'm out of State.
- How did they get mixed up with you?

404
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,417
- How did they talk you into it?
- Nobody talked me into anything.

405
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,373
They conned me out of some adobe brick
and some lumber.

406
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:57,369
I figured I could write that off, but
if you're their contractor, like you say,

407
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:01,175
tell her to take her business someplace
else. My terms are strictly cash.

408
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:04,610
- You understand, boy?
- I understand. Hey, boy!

409
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,095
- You need a good man?
- A good man.

410
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:14,688
- I can give you two days a week.
- Doing what?

411
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:17,937
- Moving earth. Those.
- You got any experience?

412
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,528
I can handle any earth-moving
equipment you've got.

413
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,969
What are you gonna be doing
the rest of the time?

414
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:27,252
What have we been talking about?
I'm gonna build me a chapel.

415
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:35,011
OK, contractor. I'll pay you the going rate
for labour on the job you're assigned.

416
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:39,975
Seven o'clock, Thursday morning. But if
you're snowing me, you'll be out at 7.15.

417
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,777
Just a second.

418
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,410
- Goodbye, Schmidt.
- Get in the car.

419
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:58,499
- We go to the bus stop.
- Don't be cute.

420
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,418
I don't want him to think
we're having a fuss.

421
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,496
- Fuss?
- Yes. Fuss.

422
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,895
You don't fuss with your contractor.

423
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,416
We can do it, Schmidt.

424
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,178
There are three ingredients to a job
like this. First, you need a plan. Check?

425
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,370
Two, you need labour.

426
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,456
But, three, you need materials.

427
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:38,731
That's for openers. You're gonna need 10,
20, 30, 40 times as many bricks as that.

428
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:42,176
Can you get them?

429
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,778
Ja!

430
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,973
OK.

431
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,934
OK. Let's get to work.

432
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,892
You still listening, Lord,

433
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:29,854
would you mind putting
a little meat on the table? Please?

434
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:48,574
The work goes well.

435
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:51,134
The problem is money.

436
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,935
I request to your organisation...

437
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,616
which is renowned for its...

438
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,129
- Philanthropics.
- Was?

439
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,739
Philanthropics.

440
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:09,773
- Was machen Sie da, Schwester?
- Das Mittagessen für Herr Schmidt.

441
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,454
Lesen Sie mir das Ganze noch mal vor.

442
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:19,337
"The Maximillian Fund,
sieben elf, Fünf Avenue, New York City.

443
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:22,691
"Highly honoured
and respected gentlemen,

444
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,177
permit me to an appeal
for financing assistance..."

445
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:29,655
No. Wait. A better word.

446
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,293
Dollars!

447
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,093
- The Lions.
- Ja.

448
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,812
- The Elks.
- Ja.

449
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:26,091
- The Order of Moose.
- Ja.

450
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,929
Kiwanis. What kind of animal is that?

451
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:31,812
Americans.

452
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:41,854
Schmidt! You make knocking.
Like I told you.

453
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:46,894
- We saved for you supper.
- No more bread and milk.

454
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:48,817
A nice potato soup.

455
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:52,296
Oh, and that'll make me
nice and fat and strong?

456
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,490
- Ja.
- And you love me fat and strong!

457
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,656
Ja.

458
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,856
Oh, Schnuller!

459
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:06,700
Hey, hey. You like that.

460
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:27,057
What now?

461
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,614
Look your hands. Dirty!

462
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:32,891
Go wash your dirty hands and face.

463
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,334
OK, I will.

464
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,248
Then I come and give for you
the English lesson. Nein? Ja!

465
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:45,291
Ja!

466
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,935
Danke dir Gott, für diesen Segen.

467
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:54,374
Ah, how about thanking me too, eh?

468
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,333
No. I thank Him.
You, you couldn't help yourself.

469
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,252
Oh, boy.

470
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,458
Wrapped in the manger

471
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:08,617
- Amen.
- On Christmas morning

472
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:14,656
- Amen, amen, amen.
- See him in the temple

473
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:17,658
- Amen.
- Talking with the elders

474
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:20,658
- Amen.
- Who marvel at his wisdom

475
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:26,696
- Amen, amen, amen.
- Down at the Jordan

476
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,812
- Amen.
- Where John was baptising

477
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,818
- Amen.
- And saving all the sinners

478
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:38,173
Amen, amen, amen...

479
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:11,090
- Come with us, Schmidt.
- No, ma'am.

480
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,973
- I'm gonna go feed my Baptist stomach.
- Come.

481
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,730
Good people of Piedras,

482
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:32,819
you have seen this man
who brings us now to the mass,

483
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:36,728
but you did not know who he was,
what he was.

484
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:40,216
I tell you now.
His name is Homer Schmidt.

485
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:46,939
He is not of our faith,
but he was sent to us by our God,

486
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,893
who is the God of all faiths.

487
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:53,695
He is building us a chapel.

488
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,014
It is true! And so we will
all see it. A miracle!

489
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,136
Hey, Mother!

490
00:49:01,420 --> 00:49:04,856
- I laid my last brick.
- A good start.

491
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,177
- And I ran out of board.
- Everything works out.

492
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:12,213
- I'm ready to keep going but...
- Everything works out.

493
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:14,251
Yeah, you said that.

494
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,612
- Tomorrow you for Ashton work?
- Tomorrow and the next day. Why?

495
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:21,049
Then we see.

496
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,810
- Look, we had a bargain. I kept my end...
- Everything works out. It's God's will.

497
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:30,615
- That we get brick or that we don't?
- Whatever.

498
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,971
You would have made a great lawyer,
you know that?

499
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,536
Bobkin.

500
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,412
Sherman.

501
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,416
Good night.

502
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,337
Smith.

503
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:55,375
- Tell me, how's the contracting business?
- It's all right.

504
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,095
Just out of curiosity,
what are you using for materials?

505
00:51:00,380 --> 00:51:02,848
We're expecting a new shipment.

506
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,015
No bricks?

507
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,858
Why do you buy things to eat
we do not need?

508
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,289
Now just a minute.

509
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,376
You are very large on religion

510
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,968
but you don't know
how to accept a gift from somebody

511
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:08,570
without making them feel small.
Small! You follow?

512
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:11,339
Poor man. His feelings is hurt!

513
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,170
I'm not twisting your arm for any big
thank-yous, but I'm through feeling small.

514
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,417
I got all the patience in the world!

515
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,808
Then why do you work on the road gang
when you should build the chapel?

516
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,896
Where are the bricks?

517
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:32,772
They will come. Maybe not tonight, but
there is other things you could be busy.

518
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,729
Raking and planting trees.

519
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,693
We had this contract.
You failed to keep your part.

520
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:43,939
I failed because I put my faith in people
instead of in God!

521
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:47,291
Forget it.
It was an invisible contract anyway.

522
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,538
- I don't believe you any more.
- Who are you not to believe me?

523
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:56,131
Hm?! Somebody
passing through thatta way?

524
00:52:56,260 --> 00:53:00,219
Me, I come 8,000 miles to this place.

525
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:04,253
You cry about a few bricks
which are not here when you want them!

526
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,736
Do you know what we went through
to get to this place?

527
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:11,335
You will not
stand in the way of this chapel.

528
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:15,410
No. It will be done.

529
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,739
Well, good luck, Charlie,
and you deal me out.

530
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,491
Yeah. That stuff you wear,

531
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:24,339
you think it's a uniform
that makes you some kind of cop,

532
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,577
laying down the law,
throwing your weight around.

533
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,979
You sound like one of them
old war movies. A regular Hitler!

534
00:53:38,020 --> 00:53:41,979
Well, you get yourself another boy.

535
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,778
Mutter Maria! Hat der Schmidt
seinen Hammer daeglassen?

536
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:28,495
Nein! He left nothing. Nothing!

537
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,656
Das haben wir nötig gehabt.

538
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:35,092
Zuerst beten wir für ihn, dann kommt er
und dann shickt sie ihn weg.

539
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,536
Nothing.

540
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,417
- You haven't heard anything from Smith?
- Nein. Nothing.

541
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,976
- It's been three weeks.
- We thought at least he write postcard...

542
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:48,297
Schweigen Sie, Schwester.
He will return.

543
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:52,299
You're sure of that? Well, I wouldn't
get too upset about it, ma'am.

544
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:55,730
He's shiftless and irresponsible,
you know the type?

545
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,535
If he should come back, tell him
I'll hold his job open for a while.

546
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,572
He's a pretty good man with a bulldozer.

547
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:00,893
Smile at the people.

548
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:06,175
But don't say anything.

549
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,776
Go get your breakfast.

550
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,336
Good morning.

551
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,496
Good morning.

552
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,690
Such a beautiful morning.

553
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:44,249
Business Sunday morning
seems to have gotten better since I left.

554
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:46,894
A question. Why?

555
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:49,978
- Why did I take off?
- No. Why you come back?

556
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:55,253
What's it to you?

557
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:03,175
Sí. Sí. Sí. Gracias.

558
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,212
- Now you have done it.
- Hm?

559
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:10,891
That was a messenger. They
want to know if you are back to stay.

560
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:16,219
I have told them yes. I make them happy.
Now you have the big breakfast, eh?

561
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,420
What will it be?

562
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,256
A coke.

563
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:31,019
"Wash yourself, Schmidt.
Vash away ze stink."

564
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:40,812
Why didn't they ask me to build
a bath tub with nice hot water?

565
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:45,895
That'd make more sense.
"Wash yourself, Schmidt."

566
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,009
That's the first kind word I've had
since I got back.

567
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,935
What bugs me, she was so positive
I was coming back.

568
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:09,816
You wouldn't happen to have
a nice cold can of beer on you?

569
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,216
I must be out of my skull coming back.

570
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:18,972
Schmidt!

571
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,576
Schmidt!

572
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,658
Schmidt, look, all these bricks!
Isn't it glorious?

573
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,492
Gracias.

574
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,296
Faulpelz. Lassen Sie doch die...

575
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,457
- Don't work them by themselves.
- This isn't enough.

576
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:50,969
- All right.
- All right? What?

577
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,056
We pray some more!

578
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:27,452
- We have come to help you.
- Thanks.

579
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,537
I thank you very much,
but I don't need any help, thank you.

580
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,975
You are sure
you are doing the right thing?

581
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,176
You prayed up a lot of bricks, Mama,

582
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:53,497
but you only prayed for one man
to build your chapel.

583
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:25,089
Hey, amigo. I had to come see
the one-man cathedral.

584
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:31,693
This is all you have done in one week?
God made the whole world in that time.

585
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:34,129
And he was able to rest.

586
01:02:35,660 --> 01:02:38,254
Hey. Notice your audience.

587
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:44,372
- I can't get rid of 'em.
- They heard it was the best show in town!

588
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:18,092
Está bien para UN americano.

589
01:03:49,340 --> 01:03:51,854
Move your foot off my adobe.

590
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,329
Where would you like us to bury you?
Under the altar?

591
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,416
Move your foot off my adobe.

592
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:55,210
You do not want it? Do not take it.
Step over it and go get another one.

593
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,370
A piece of pie?

594
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,338
I'm not hungry.

595
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:44,179
Was ist los mit dem? Was ist?

596
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,169
I wanted to build it myself.

597
01:06:49,300 --> 01:06:52,656
Those people help you and all is well.

598
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:57,171
I don't want any help.
I wanted to build it myself.

599
01:06:57,300 --> 01:07:00,292
That way it would be built
slowly and carefully.

600
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:04,015
So now it's fast and it's ready the sooner.

601
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:06,096
The Archbishop...

602
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:12,011
If he is busy, he will not come
but I think we should invite him.

603
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:14,813
Look...

604
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:20,172
You see, all my life,
I wanted to really build something.

605
01:07:23,140 --> 01:07:27,213
Maybe if I had had an education I would
have been an architect or an engineer -

606
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:31,731
throw the Golden Gate Bridge
across San Francisco Bay.

607
01:07:31,860 --> 01:07:35,250
And even maybe
build a rocket ship to Venus.

608
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:43,015
I'm not getting through to you.

609
01:07:43,140 --> 01:07:48,294
Well, the chapel is being built
and that's all that matters.

610
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,699
I wanted to build it myself.

611
01:07:55,860 --> 01:07:58,169
God is building out there the chapel

612
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:02,088
and you sit here feeling sorry for yourself
because you are not Him?

613
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:06,533
Ah.

614
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:20,490
He did not finish den Kaffee.

615
01:08:33,140 --> 01:08:35,495
You build the walls too high.

616
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,490
Die Mauern. Die Mauern... zu hoch.

617
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:45,489
Der Balken - nicht dort, da anfangen.
Verstehen Sie mich?

618
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:47,770
Necesitamos para el marco DE la ventana.

619
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:50,255
Es ist ja ganz egal, was Sie sagen.

620
01:08:50,380 --> 01:08:54,851
Es ist kein Platz für den Beichtstuhl
und das Weihwasser vorgesehen.

621
01:08:54,980 --> 01:08:59,770
Mother Maria, no comprende
sus instrucionnes.

622
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,936
Das ist nicht richtig. Verstehen Sie?

623
01:09:05,860 --> 01:09:08,897
Aber das ist nicht richtig.
Verstehen Sie?

624
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,573
Deswegen hat die Mutter Maria gesagt,
wir müssen...

625
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:32,769
Ah, Francesco.
Der Wanden is for support. The wall.

626
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,650
Madre mia! What am I doing here?

627
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:42,412
Amigo!

628
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:52,092
Everybody. Everybody! Everybody!

629
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,734
It is wrong... was ihr macht.

630
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:59,013
Eine Kirche is for Beten. Beten.

631
01:09:59,140 --> 01:10:03,691
Look, you promised them a chapel,
now they will have nothing. Nada.

632
01:10:03,820 --> 01:10:06,618
With practically application.

633
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:10,415
So... Oh, do not stop now.

634
01:10:11,420 --> 01:10:14,298
OK, OK. I thought you was loco.

635
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:17,298
I was wrong. You was right.

636
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:22,856
See, I have the big humility, amigo.
How about you?

637
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:29,175
The walls are high too much.

638
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:33,215
The padre was right.

639
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:37,731
You quit, they go home,
the walls fall down,

640
01:10:37,860 --> 01:10:40,055
the rain, she melts the bricks,

641
01:10:40,180 --> 01:10:43,331
the wind, she blows away the dust.

642
01:10:43,460 --> 01:10:46,691
They will be back
getting their spiritual comfort

643
01:10:46,820 --> 01:10:49,380
from the back end of a pie wagon.

644
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:53,379
Come!
Please come back like it was.

645
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:58,210
Everyone working together
and laughing and singing!

646
01:10:58,340 --> 01:11:00,695
And that's the way how it should be!

647
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:06,049
Hold it!

648
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:08,136
Everything is cockeyed.

649
01:11:08,260 --> 01:11:11,411
That beam - Mario, Pedro -
it belongs there.

650
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:15,613
Here's the way it goes. That beam
sits on a joist and it supports the roof.

651
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,174
- You got it?
- Sí.

652
01:11:18,300 --> 01:11:20,689
And the walls are not high enough.

653
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:24,859
- Jesus, we need more adobe all around.
- Sí, señor.

654
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,050
- Some boss, eh?
- Sí.

655
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,171
A job needs a boss
who knows what he's doing.

656
01:11:29,300 --> 01:11:32,337
I'm no boss, but I just know
how I want my chapel built.

657
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,533
Felipe, once we get that beam in place,
we're gonna pitch the roof, yeah?

658
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:40,050
- Like this. You follow?
- El boss!

659
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:47,736
All right. Vamanos.
Let's get this show on the road.

660
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:51,136
Let's go. Girls, these men
are gonna need food - lots of it.

661
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:54,889
So start squeezing that cow
and buttering up those sandwiches.

662
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:57,295
More adobe in here! Let's go!

663
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,376
You too, Mama. Macht schnell!

664
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,456
A Hitler.

665
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,933
Adobe.

666
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:45,813
This was made for ten thousand years.

667
01:12:45,940 --> 01:12:48,329
- Feel good!
- Ja!

668
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:50,735
- Boss wants more adobe.
- Ja.

669
01:12:50,860 --> 01:12:52,816
Where is the boss?

670
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:14,697
Hey, put another man on this beam!
Miguel!

671
01:13:14,820 --> 01:13:17,539
I need you topside to tie off this truss.

672
01:13:21,820 --> 01:13:24,459
Easy does it. Hold it there.

673
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:26,536
Hold it there.

674
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:31,812
Oh, hello... Get up there and tie off
that side. He'll be up in a second.

675
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,296
- I heard about this in town.
- Yeah, you did?

676
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:39,776
- Juan, think the barbecue's ready?
- Oh, sí. Sí, señor.

677
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:42,972
- Let them tie off this, then call lunch.
- OK, boss.

678
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:45,056
Some boss!

679
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:48,172
Muchachos! Lunch! Lunch!

680
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,056
Lunch! Lunch!

681
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,258
Say, where'd you get all the materials?

682
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:08,452
- The people give them, señor.
- What for?

683
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:10,730
A man he gives wood, bricks.

684
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:13,294
This time, what does he get? A chapel.

685
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:16,412
A place where his children
can receive the sacraments.

686
01:14:16,540 --> 01:14:19,259
For their children to have faith,
it is important.

687
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:23,419
- Is that why you're here?
- To me, it is insurance.

688
01:14:23,540 --> 01:14:28,409
To me, life is here on this earth. I cannot
see further so I cannot believe further.

689
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:33,819
But if they are right about the hereafter,
I have paid my insurance, señor.

690
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,455
Hey, boss!

691
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:47,654
- Is there something I can do for you?
- Well, I'm kind of short-handed.

692
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,736
Getting good labour is always a problem.

693
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,010
Oh, really?

694
01:14:52,140 --> 01:14:54,370
Er, I've got a new freeway deal.

695
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:57,980
Sorry, Mr Ashton,
but I've got a church contract.

696
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:01,251
Well, when you're finished,
I could use a foreman, Mr Smith.

697
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:09,453
Thanks, Mr Ashton. But when
I'm finished here, I'll be moving on.

698
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,332
- But thanks.
- Señor Homer?

699
01:15:14,740 --> 01:15:16,332
Oh.

700
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:22,009
Well, we're gonna have to find
a very special place to put that!

701
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:24,096
Thank you. Thank you.

702
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,094
You'd better take this to Mother Maria.

703
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,016
Everybody wants to give.

704
01:15:38,460 --> 01:15:40,928
Hey, mister. Mister.

705
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:43,779
Today we raise the roof.
We have fiesta. You come?

706
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,619
Oh. No. No, thanks.

707
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:49,538
I've got something I have to do,
but thanks.

708
01:15:49,660 --> 01:15:51,412
DE nada. Adios.

709
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:15,251
"Und Gott war das Wort..."

710
01:16:51,780 --> 01:16:56,092
Dieser verrückte Schmidt
und seine verrückten Freunde.

711
01:16:56,220 --> 01:16:58,688
Perdónelos, madre,
que todos son unos borrachos.

712
01:16:58,820 --> 01:17:01,937
They build a house, a barn,
there's always a fiesta.

713
01:17:02,060 --> 01:17:05,018
Fiesta! In my chapel!

714
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,374
Gringo man!

715
01:17:15,780 --> 01:17:19,170
Gringo! I don't know
if that's a step up or a step down

716
01:17:19,300 --> 01:17:22,019
from somethin' else
I've been called all my life!

717
01:17:36,900 --> 01:17:40,415
- Well, you are awake?
- I guess so.

718
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:41,973
Good.

719
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:46,452
Why'd you do that?

720
01:17:46,580 --> 01:17:49,538
The women last night
say that is the only thing

721
01:17:49,660 --> 01:17:53,130
when a man has been mixing wine
with tequila.

722
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:55,694
I'm gonna mix you... With tequila!

723
01:18:09,940 --> 01:18:12,659
Por favor, shut that thing off!

724
01:18:12,780 --> 01:18:16,250
Morning! I've brought
something over for your chapel.

725
01:18:17,300 --> 01:18:20,337
They're seconds but I figured
you could use them somewhere.

726
01:18:20,460 --> 01:18:23,770
- They were taking up space at the yard.
- What do you think?

727
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:27,051
We could crush 'em.
Use them for gravel for the wall.

728
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:32,095
But those are worth... I mean...
Well, they've been fired good and strong.

729
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:36,813
- Thanks.
- Mr Ashton!

730
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,692
Mr Ashton!

731
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:44,418
I should have sent those bricks over
anonymously.

732
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:50,331
He's very generous - he sees we're
building with adobe, he gives us bricks.

733
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:53,418
They're very expensive.
I wonder what made him do it.

734
01:18:53,540 --> 01:18:56,008
- Insurance.
- What?

735
01:18:56,140 --> 01:18:57,892
Forget it.

736
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,695
Mr Ashton, we need bricks,
we need lumber,

737
01:19:03,820 --> 01:19:07,449
we need shingles and plenty of cement.

738
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:10,094
Because we will build a school
and a hospital.

739
01:19:10,220 --> 01:19:14,179
And we need beams please, Mr Ashton.
Do you understand?

740
01:19:19,460 --> 01:19:21,416
Hey, Smith.

741
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:33,012
You and getting everybody involved.
You've been making a lot of mischief.

742
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:35,210
- What's the matter?
- She's really after me.

743
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:39,379
- But the chapel's almost finished.
- Oh, no. She's just beginning.

744
01:19:39,500 --> 01:19:41,809
Next she'll want a school, then a hospital

745
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:44,090
and only God knows - and she -
what comes next.

746
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:49,135
Only so much is deductible.
She's gonna be on my back from now on!

747
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,216
That sweet old lady?

748
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:04,014
- Señor Boss, can I help you?
- No, gracias. This part is mine.

749
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:06,096
This part is mine.

750
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,688
Señor Smith? Will it have bells?

751
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,776
Sure. Some day.

752
01:22:16,020 --> 01:22:17,533
So...

753
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:21,132
So.

754
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:23,569
Tomorrow, the first masses.

755
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:27,291
See...

756
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:29,650
Seat in the front. You.

757
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,975
Where all the people can see you.

758
01:22:33,660 --> 01:22:37,130
And every one of these bricks
over the door I put in myself.

759
01:22:49,260 --> 01:22:53,731
A real church for you to say the mass.
Es verdad, padre?

760
01:23:15,220 --> 01:23:18,257
There is so much to do. So much to do.

761
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:23,015
Tomorrow from Northfolk
the town choir is coming.

762
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:28,612
The boys and girls. Such beautiful voices
you never have heard.

763
01:23:28,740 --> 01:23:30,571
Forgive me.

764
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,772
They will stand over there
and up there flowers.

765
01:23:34,900 --> 01:23:39,098
On both sides of the altar, flowers.
Nothing but flowers.

766
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:41,780
I have much to do. Much to do.

767
01:23:41,900 --> 01:23:47,213
Many years ago, I made
a very vain and selfish prayer.

768
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:52,736
Now He has answered my prayer
through you, through many people.

769
01:23:54,660 --> 01:23:58,938
I... I pray now I become worthy
of His trust and yours.

770
01:24:00,620 --> 01:24:04,329
I have so much to do. So much to do.

771
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:33,655
Ave Maris Stella

772
01:24:34,020 --> 01:24:38,491
Dei Mater alma

773
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:44,809
Atque semper virgo

774
01:24:44,940 --> 01:24:49,138
Felix coeli porta

775
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:54,288
Amen

776
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,493
Do you feel all right?

777
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:06,980
- Tonight you not smile, Herr Schmidt.
- Come on, smile.

778
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:10,137
This is like the first night you come, ja?

779
01:25:10,780 --> 01:25:13,248
- Schmidt!
- Nothing's changed.

780
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:15,733
Schmidt.

781
01:25:17,620 --> 01:25:21,056
You did not fasten the pews to the floor...

782
01:25:21,180 --> 01:25:23,535
It's done.

783
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,857
You must oil the doors
