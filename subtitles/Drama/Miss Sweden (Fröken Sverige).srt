<i>Kim Eun Chul </i>

3
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,640
I passed!

4
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,610
Son! Son! What happened? Did you pass?

5
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,670
Here. My name.

00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,380
<i>Final list of people who failed the judicial exam. </i>

7
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,330
How did this happen? This can't be. I'm Kim Eun Chul.

8
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,310
I'm Kim Eun Chul with an IQ of 157. No way.

9
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,240
This is nonsense!

10
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,350
<i>Oppa, come and eat! </i>

11
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:34,440
Do you think I can eat right now? This is a nightmare!

12
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,040
No!

13
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,910
I told you to come and eat. B-o-p! (Rice/Meal) Bop! Bop!

14
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:49,990
Are you not quiet these days? You ruined my condition in the morning.

15
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,390
So annoying. Why is he yelling at me?

16
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,160
<i>Episode 8</i> 
<i>Laundry for the worried youth. </i>

<i>Day before the exam 8:15 AM </i>

18
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,470
-Tomorrow is the first part of the judicial exam, so be careful not to catch a cold. And eat slowly so you don't get indigestion. 
-Okay.

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,140
Here, princess.

20
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:30,990
Should I remove the fish bones for you judge Kim?

21
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,760
Yes.

22
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,490
Our Madame Yang, you're number one in jumping the gun.

23
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,830
The judicial exam hasn't even started yet. Why is he a judge?

24
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,240
-Hey!
-What?

25
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,110
This damned girl. Have you ever seen your brother fail an exam?

26
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,600
Why are you acting like an amateur?

27
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,460
What's the point in passing? He already dropped out twice during the training period.

28
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:57,110
Won't he leave this time too?

29
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,740
This time he promised me that he would finish his training and the judicial research institute.

30
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,440
Isn't that right, judge Kim?

31
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,050
Yes, don't worry.

32
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,270
Hey, Kim Bom. Eat quietly! I can't read in the middle of all this ruckus.

33
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:20,910
What can I do? I have a fish bone stuck in my throat!

34
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,770
Why do you keep yelling at me since earlier?

35
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,940
Hey! Stop eating and go. Let go of those chopsticks!

36
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:27,800
Okay, Okay.

37
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,650
I bet that noona will come looking for a snack again after eating breakfast.

38
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,980
Where else would there be a good boyfriend like this?

39
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,830
Boyfriend...You crazy man.

40
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:52,240
What boyfriend?

41
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,410
Maybe her future boyfriend.

42
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,340
You're here?

43
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,070
Is that a red bean bun? Can I eat it?

44
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,970
Yes.

45
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,920
Eat slowly. Slowly.

46
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,600
Thank you. You eat one too.

47
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,790
<i>Cute. </i>

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,130
Why are you smiling?

49
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,370
Huh?

50
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:35,630
You're going to choke. Eat slowly. Who is going to take your food?

51
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:48,210
<i>Wait.. Is this an indirect kiss? </i>

52
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,050
You should drink too.

53
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:55,020
Hey, you're so careless. Take it off.

54
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,470
What?

55
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,100
I'll wash it for you so take it off.

56
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,670
Why are you doing this? It's okay.

57
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,850
It's hard to remove fruit stains. Hurry up and take it off.

58
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,880
Please!

59
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,630
You shouldn't be taking off a man's clothes so openly in the middle of the day.

60
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,420
A man? Bull Sh*t. Aren't you still in your diapers?

61
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,620
He's a young man.

62
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,200
Welcome!

63
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,130
Please dry clean this for me.

64
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:35,080
Ok. I'll take good care of it.

65
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,190
<i>This is for your academy fee. You have to get a good job this year. </i>

66
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:00,540
<i>I'm sorry, mom. </i>

67
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:07,280
<i>If you're late on the interest again, </i>

68
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,560
<i>I won't go easy on you. </i>

69
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:22,430
So scary! What is that? What is so nightmarish?

70
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,320
Wait. Where did I see that girl before?

71
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:30,610
That will be 7,900 Won.

72
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,980
Ah. She's a student that works part-time at a convenience store.

73
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,170
But what's going on?

74
00:06:38,170 --> 00:06:41,450
Is there's something she's being blackmailed for?

75
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,960
So scary! And what was that ghost?

76
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,190
It's time. Why isn't he coming out? 
<i>Day before the exam 4:25 PM</i>

77
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,530
It's oppa!

78
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,910
Oppa!

79
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,340
Since I don't have the time to talk to you, can you move?

80
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,960
Okay. Since it's your exam day tomorrow,

81
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,280
I just came to give you this.

82
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,480
I paid 300,000 won for that talisman to give to you so you can pass the exam.

83
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,330
If you have this talisman, you can get 100% on your exam!

84
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,300
I'm not a person who believes in superstitions like this so take it back.

85
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,610
It's not a superstition? That guy is so good.

86
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:31,360
He knew that I almost drowned while playing in the ocean when I was young.

87
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,950
And he knew that I didn't study well in school.

88
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:36,850
Who has no experience of almost drowning in their childhood?

89
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:42,330
And after just talking with you for a few minutes, who can't tell that you didn't study well in school?

90
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,200
He even knew that there is a man in my life.

91
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,680
He said he's younger, the same age or older than me.

92
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,120
Younger, the same age or older. Is there anything else?

93
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,740
There's nothing else?

94
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,810
Anyway, I don't need this talisman so whether you return it or not

95
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:06,500
Do whatever you want to do. I'm going.

96
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,590
Oppa!

97
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:32,010


98
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:37,620
What are you doing?

99
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:48,020
This...

100
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,940
You're telling me to sew this on oppa's underwear behind his back?

101
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:54,390
If that's too hard can't you put it in his backpack?

102
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:01,410
This is such a waste of money. You paid 300,000 won just for a piece of paper?

103
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:05,420
You said it's just a piece of paper? Bad luck.

104
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,680
You better put it in there.

105
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,850
Because if you don't and Eun Chul oppa fails the exam, I'm going to blame you.

106
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:14,010
Fine.

107
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,380
<i>She spent 300,000 won on a talisman? </i>

108
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:28,100
I clearly told her not to spend more than 30,000 won on a guy.

109
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,400
What happened with looking up his background?

110
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,190
Chauffeur Park.

111
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:38,670
Why is the font Times New Roman?

112
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,880
Don't you know I don't like that font?

113
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,430
I told you to use Arial!

114
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:46,410
I'm sorry, madam. I'll redo it.

115
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,930
But that'll take forever.

116
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:52,370
Can't you do anything right? Why don't you know this simple thing?

117
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,870
Go.

118
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,080
Kim Bom. 27 year old younger sister.

119
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,310
She owns a laundry. Kim Eun Chul was Kim Bom's brother?

120
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:13,910
It sucks that he doesn't have a job. And even his family has no roots.

121
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,720
I'm upset.

122
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,200
I'm home!

123
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:22,690
Oh, baby! You have taken your business management lessons.

124
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,090
I have something to say, come sit down for a bit.

125
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,830
What is it?

126
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:37,640
My baby... You're already 27. You're quiet and lady-like but you never even get to date anyone.

127
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,310
Mommy is very upset about that.

128
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,280
You know I can't look into a man's eyes

129
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,300
because I'm so shy.

130
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,590
Of course I have no interest in dating.

131
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,270
So I'm going to set you up with a man.

132
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:58,900
Set up? I don't like being set up.

133
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:03,250
You're like an orchard in a greenhouse, baby.

134
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:07,830
A bee has to come and find you. Cause a flower can't go looking around for a bee.

135
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,840
Mommy is only looking at men who came from good schools and good families.

136
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,470
I'm only looking for high class men so you just wait. Ok?

137
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,470
I don't know.

138
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:20,910
I just want to focus diligently on my business management classes for now.

139
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,810
Mommy, please keep that in mind.

140
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:27,820
Baby...

141
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:34,100
What should I do? I can't even tell my husband about this.

142
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:45,640
I think the convenience store the girl is working at is somewhere in this vicinity.

143
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,910
Give me back my money.

144
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,640
Let go. Let go of this.

145
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,910
<i>Give me back my money! </i>

146
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,660
Let go of this. I told you I can't return the money that was spent on appeasing the spirits.

147
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,420
You said if I gave money to the spirits I would be able to get a job.

148
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:03,310
You couldn't get a job because you weren't devout enough. Ugh, seriously.

149
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,970
Appease the spirits again. I'll do it for 5 million won.

150
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:08,610
Did you think I would get fooled again?

151
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:11,680
Just give me back my money!

152
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
If you feel wronged then you can sue me.

153
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:18,310
My money...

154
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,910
Are you okay?

155
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:44,010


156
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,110
Thank you.

157
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:51,290
You should drink it when it's warm. My grandmother once said

158
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,690
When you're cold in the inside and out,

159
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,270
you should give warmth to your inside.

160
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,060
Yes.

161
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,230
I seem like a pathetic fool, don't I?

162
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:09,280
No. When you live there are times when misfortunes happen.

163
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,960
I failed and failed again at getting a job.

164
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,110
When I felt like I was dangling off the edge off a cliff,

165
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:21,030
That's when someone held out his hand.

166
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,450
I thought that hand,

167
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:27,070
was going to grab me.

168
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:41,390
<i>My father passed away when I was young. </i>

169
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:45,480
<i>My mom raised me and my younger sister all by herself. </i>

170
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:53,380
<i>I wanted to get a job quickly and take care of my mother, but </i>

171
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:58,220
<i>I'm sorry but you couldn't get the job. </i>

172
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:03,520
<i>I tried so hard for several years, but I still couldn't get a job. </i>

173
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,810
There's nothing wrong with you, but are you trying to find a job?

174
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,860
What?

175
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,860
Come and find me.

176
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,190
<i>That is the time</i>

177
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:14,870
<i>that person approached me. </i>

178
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,510
Let's see... the God of rice cakes.

179
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,450
Look. You saw how it fell?

180
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:29,470
If you pay to appease the spirits, it'll stick on.

181
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,340
If I pay to appease the spirits, I'll be able to get a job right?

182
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:38,010
For the past year, I've been here helping numerous people get jobs.

183
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,930
-How many?
-1387 people.

184
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,200
You heard, right? Including you it's 1388.

185
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:59,540
<i>I gave him 10 million won. I even borrowed money from a loan shark. </i>

186
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,610
Please take care of me. Definitely take care of me.

187
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:09,420
In the end, I failed.

188
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:14,460
That time he pretended to hold my hand at the edge of the cliff,

189
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,510
but then he just pushed me off.

190
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,160
Did you try reporting this to the police? This is fraud.

191
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:35,260
I tried but they said they can't be prosecuted.

192
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,000
Who can I blame?

193
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,570
I'm the idiot for believing in their lives.

194
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:50,790
I wish I could just end my life here.

195
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,700
Don't say stuff like that. I'll get your money back for you.

196
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,320
Then you can comfortably start looking for a job.

197
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,550
Bom, why would you do that?

198
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:06,570
Huh? Uh, about that...

199
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,590
Look. I was also tricked by that guy.

200
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:20,060
I'll get your money back for you, no matter what.

201
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,240
Thank you for your kind words.

202
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,950
It's time for me to go to work, so I'll leave first.

203
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,900
You're here? 
<i>Day before the exam 8:40 PM </i>

204
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,340
I want our Eun Chul to get married as soon as he becomes a judge.

205
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:52,550
Please look for a good match for him.

206
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,080
Of course.

207
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,600
-At least that much.
-For those who committed crimes listed in sections 329 to 322,

208
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,390
Up to half those crimes can be punished by...

209
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:11,230
It's section 330. For those who committed crimes listen in sections 329 to 330,

210
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,340
Up to half those crimes can be punished by...

211
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,070
<i>Where do I put it? </i>

212
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,210
<i>Is Young Mi making you do that? </i>

213
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:21,810
Yeah. Young Mi told me when you weren't looking-

214
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,470
You do whatever she tells you to do?

215
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,840
Oppa, are you okay?

216
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:38,130
That talisman. Go and throw it out right now.

217
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:42,190
But still, Young Mi was thinking about you when she bought this. And she spent a fortune.

218
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,470
Get out.

219
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,430
Okay.

220
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,410
<i>It's not that he got cut from the training institution. </i>

221
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,270
<i>My son just quit and left because it didn't fit him well. </i>

222
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,040
<i>Job training professor Min Chul Soo </i>

223
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,660
Kim Eun Chul. 
<i>National Diplomat Academy 2 years ago</i>

224
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,770
Do you not know the meaning of a group project?

225
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,130
I have you a warning the last time too.

226
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:20,700
But again you handed in a report by yourself.

227
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,050
I couldn't agree with the group. I had no choice.

228
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:26,610
Did you even try to come to an agreement?

229
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:28,460
What I heard,

230
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,910
Was that you said you can't work with people

231
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:34,740
who are on a lower level than you.

232
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,480
I was only saying the truth that they were on a lower level.

233
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:46,550
Kim Eun Chul. I hope you're aware that your evaluations are one of the worst.

234
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:51,270
Your rash and uncooperative attitude

235
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,650
is unfit for diplomatic work.

283
00:18:55,575 --> 00:18:58,750
That idiotic dictator...

284
00:18:59,384 --> 00:19:01,840
I heard he didn't participate in the group project again.

285
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:05,467
He thinks he's better than everyone else.

286
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,383
Even if he goes through the training,  he won't get any job offers.

287
00:19:09,383 --> 00:19:10,543
Of course not.

288
00:19:10,543 --> 00:19:12,295
What's the use of being smart?

289
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:13,889
He's got no social skills.

290
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:16,812
He'll just continue to act like a loser, and get cut.

291
00:19:28,797 --> 00:19:30,742
You quit and left?

292
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:32,599
They may have passed the foreign service

293
00:19:32,599 --> 00:19:34,456
officer exam, but they are at such a low level.

294
00:19:34,456 --> 00:19:37,017
I could never work in that environment.

295
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:42,456
You said even the Minister of Foreign Affairs called and asked you to stay.

296
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,569
He did.

297
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:48,834
My colleagues wanted me to stay, too.

298
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:52,827
Then maybe you should have just stuck around.

299
00:19:52,827 --> 00:19:55,278
Even when you took the public officer qualification exam,

300
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:57,728
you left during the training period.

301
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,497
Mother.

302
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:03,008
I want to take the bar exam.

303
00:20:03,456 --> 00:20:08,867
I think that's a worthwhile place where I can prove my skills.

304
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:14,973
I need to respect your decision.

305
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,769
But what am I going to do about the academy fees?

306
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:26,980
Whatever...

307
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,000
I can take out a loan, or tell Bom to take money out of her account.

308
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:34,692
But...

309
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,318
You are going to finish your training there, right?

310
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,001
Yes, Mother.

311
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,873
This will be the last time.

312
00:20:42,873 --> 00:20:44,398
Don't worry.

313
00:20:44,988 --> 00:20:45,841
Okay.

314
00:20:45,841 --> 00:20:48,565
I have faith in you.

315
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:52,625
You must become a judge or a prosecutor, okay?

316
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,980
Okay, no matter what.

317
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,199
- I must...
- You must...

318
00:21:09,648 --> 00:21:12,572
He'll definitely finish the training period this time.

319
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:14,473
Please find a good match for him.

320
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:19,488
Of course, we care about her education. Her husband will be a judge after all.

321
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,004
Of course.

322
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,009
I heard it's on the 10th floor of this studio building.

323
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:41,109
It must be there.

324
00:21:52,364 --> 00:21:54,698
He's done for today. Goodbye.

325
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:59,200
I'm not here to get my fortunes told.

326
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,496
I have something to say to that quack, so move!

327
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:04,937
What's with this girl? What the heck?

328
00:22:06,552 --> 00:22:08,782
Let's see...

329
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:13,411
I won't get the job this time, either?

330
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,873
Don't be disappointed.

331
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:18,379
If you call upon the spirits, you'll have no problem getting a job.

332
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,201
What's wrong with you?

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,565
Can I get a job too, if I call upon the spirits?

334
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,973
- This girl just keeps...
- Let go!

335
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:31,823
Your problem is not getting a job.

336
00:22:31,823 --> 00:22:33,646
What's the use of making money?

337
00:22:33,646 --> 00:22:35,471
Because of all the men crowding around you...

338
00:22:35,471 --> 00:22:37,938
You won't be able to save any money.

339
00:22:37,938 --> 00:22:39,428
You need to appease the spirits.

340
00:22:39,428 --> 00:22:41,549
Men are crowding around me?

341
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:45,415
I've never had a single boyfriend in all my life.

342
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,057
I mean after you find a job.

343
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:53,333
Not now.

344
00:22:55,798 --> 00:22:59,057
I'm the CEO of a laundromat right now!

345
00:22:59,057 --> 00:23:00,929
- CEO?
- What's this?

346
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:02,979
- He got everything wrong.
- I thought he was good.

347
00:23:02,979 --> 00:23:05,750
This person is a total fraud.

348
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:08,461
He lies and says that you'll get a job if you just pay to call upon the spirits.

349
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,790
He's a total crook.

350
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,404
So go before he takes all your money. Hurry, and get up!

351
00:23:13,404 --> 00:23:16,230
- Hurry, and leave.
- Listen, girls...

352
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,813
Go...Get out!

353
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:20,646
Go, go...

354
00:23:21,164 --> 00:23:22,690
What's wrong with you?

355
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,726
How dare you walk into my workplace and ruin everything?

356
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:27,828
Me?

357
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,703
I'm Park Ji Young's friend.

358
00:23:29,703 --> 00:23:31,674
You cheated my friend.

359
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,248
Give me the 10 million won you took from her right now!

360
00:23:34,915 --> 00:23:37,498
Why are you taking it out on me?

361
00:23:37,498 --> 00:23:39,707
It didn't work because she wasn't being devout enough.

362
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:40,842
Jerk!

363
00:23:43,774 --> 00:23:47,547
You are nothing but a crook that takes money from those trying to find jobs.

364
00:23:47,547 --> 00:23:49,413
What did you say?

365
00:23:49,413 --> 00:23:51,903
You should experience how it feels to get strangled, too.

366
00:23:51,903 --> 00:23:52,965
Min Soo!

367
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:56,218
This psychopath is going to kill me!

368
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,092
- Die!
- Min Soo!

369
00:23:58,092 --> 00:24:00,002
Let go of this, and talk.

370
00:24:00,002 --> 00:24:02,179
- What's wrong with this woman?
- Mind your business!

371
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,639
Jerk!

372
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,567
What are you looking at?

373
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,260
Just give me the money!

374
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:20,519
I wanted to live a quiet life.

375
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,980
That jerk!

376
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:27,443
I should have beaten him up until he gave me the money.

377
00:24:27,443 --> 00:24:30,014
Still, violence is wrong.

378
00:24:30,572 --> 00:24:34,477
If it's hard to resolve this alone,why don't you ask for help?

379
00:24:34,477 --> 00:24:35,934
Help? From who?

380
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,042
Young Mi?

381
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,627
No, that artist guy.

382
00:24:39,627 --> 00:24:42,200
Grandma, he's a total baby.

383
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,198
Baby.

384
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:44,745
He can't help with anything.
 
385
00:24:46,745 --> 00:24:49,623
They say everything has a use. He's better than nothing.

386
00:24:49,623 --> 00:24:51,455
I'll think about it.

387
00:24:51,593 --> 00:24:56,939
Anyway, can you give me the power to look into the future?

388
00:24:56,939 --> 00:24:58,202
Why?

389
00:24:58,202 --> 00:25:00,624
You want to open up a fortune telling business on the side?

390
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,067
It's not that.

391
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,304
I want to let Ji Young know when she'll find a job.

392
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:08,360
And I'm a little worried about Eun Chul, too.

393
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,730
Right...

394
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,658
Tomorrow is the bar exam.

395
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:12,636
Yeah.

396
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:18,053
Mom is already calling him 'Judge Kim' and totally jumping the gun.

397
00:25:18,053 --> 00:25:20,668
I think he's feeling pressured.

398
00:25:20,668 --> 00:25:25,847
I usually can't tell you but I'll tell you just this once.

399
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:31,783
Got it?

400
00:25:31,783 --> 00:25:32,528
What?

401
00:25:32,528 --> 00:25:33,880
What did you say?

402
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,203
I didn't hear anything.

403
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:37,271
I said I would tell you just once.

404
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:40,046
I'll see you again, granddaughter.

405
00:25:40,046 --> 00:25:43,619
How can you do this? Tell me again before you go...

406
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:44,937
Grandma...

407
00:25:45,269 --> 00:25:47,259
She left again.

408
00:25:49,361 --> 00:25:56,255
[Day of the exam, 7:30 AM]

409
00:25:57,834 --> 00:25:59,836
He studied so hard for the past year.

410
00:26:03,231 --> 00:26:05,834
Eun Chul, get yourself something good to eat.

411
00:26:11,078 --> 00:26:12,068
What's this?

412
00:26:12,068 --> 00:26:15,221
He's still holding onto the talisman that Young Mi bought?

413
00:26:16,239 --> 00:26:18,707
He acts all cocky...

414
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:21,430
But I guess he's got no other choice when it comes to getting a job.

415
00:26:25,851 --> 00:26:27,026
What were you doing?

416
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:28,521
Nothing.

417
00:26:29,306 --> 00:26:31,393
You're not going to eat?

418
00:26:31,393 --> 00:26:32,735
I don't feel like eating.

419
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:35,586
Still, you can't go on an empty stomach to take a test.

420
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,524
I'll make some warm citron tea.

421
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:38,929
You should drink it before you go.

422
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:53,481
My hopes and dreams, you've always done well on even the hardest exams.

423
00:26:53,481 --> 00:26:55,131
I'm not worried at all.

424
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:58,192
Don't make any mistakes, and get home when you are done.

425
00:26:59,086 --> 00:27:01,913
Eun Chul, I had a really good dream last night.

426
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:04,345
I think you'll pass with flying colors.

427
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:06,047
Okay.

428
00:27:06,645 --> 00:27:07,578
Eun Chul!

429
00:27:08,004 --> 00:27:08,833
Eun Chul...

430
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:10,327
Drink this before you go.

431
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:12,212
I made it with honey.

432
00:27:12,212 --> 00:27:15,221
Yeah, you should drink something to warm yourself up.

433
00:27:19,855 --> 00:27:21,376
Wretched girl...

434
00:27:21,376 --> 00:27:24,748
Why the heck did you break the cup on his exam day?

435
00:27:24,748 --> 00:27:25,971
Why did you do that?

436
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:30,489
Nice job...

437
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:31,402
Ki Joon.

438
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:38,721
Ki Joon, what brings you here so early in the morning?

439
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:42,517
I came to wish Eun Chul good luck on the test.

440
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:44,944
I guess you are busy.

441
00:27:44,944 --> 00:27:46,188
I'm not busy.

442
00:27:46,188 --> 00:27:47,077
Come on in.

443
00:27:47,077 --> 00:27:48,106
Okay.

444
00:27:52,268 --> 00:27:56,389
He saw me getting beat up by Mom so early in the morning.

445
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,975
How embarrassing.

446
00:27:59,718 --> 00:28:01,804
Bom, wait up!

447
00:28:06,594 --> 00:28:08,146
You're going to work early.

448
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,789
How is the laundry business?

449
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:10,953
Not bad.

450
00:28:11,883 --> 00:28:14,710
That hospital gown you washed for me...

451
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,504
it became like new.

452
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:18,513
You've got an expert's touch.

453
00:28:18,513 --> 00:28:21,307
Since I was young, laundry was a hobby for me.

454
00:28:21,307 --> 00:28:23,962
I'm really good attaking the stains out.

455
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:25,850
Laundry was your hobby?

456
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,441
That's very unique.

457
00:28:28,064 --> 00:28:30,106
What's your hobby?

458
00:28:30,106 --> 00:28:33,665
I like playing instruments...and watching movies.

459
00:28:33,665 --> 00:28:36,784
- I like watching movies, too.
- Yeah?

460
00:28:36,784 --> 00:28:38,490
We should go watch a movie together sometime then.

461
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:40,376
Have a good day!

462
00:28:40,376 --> 00:28:41,469
Wait.

463
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:43,027
When?

464
00:28:43,027 --> 00:28:46,742
Let's decide the exact date and time to the second right now.

465
00:28:46,742 --> 00:28:47,693
Now.

466
00:28:47,693 --> 00:28:48,865
Right now.

467
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,869
Mrs. Kim.

468
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:07,937
From a family of doctors or professors...

469
00:29:07,937 --> 00:29:10,854
Is it so hard to find a doctor, prosecutor, judge, lawyer...

470
00:29:10,854 --> 00:29:15,295
or high ranking civil servant who graduated from a top school?

471
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,630
Madame, if the man has all those qualifications

472
00:29:18,630 --> 00:29:21,963
he would be very picky about the girl's family and education.

473
00:29:21,963 --> 00:29:24,851
What's wrong with our family?

474
00:29:24,851 --> 00:29:28,182
And Young Mi may not have gone to college, but...

475
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:31,394
Mrs. Kim.

476
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:35,287
Mrs. Kim, why is it so hard to get in contact with you?

477
00:29:37,586 --> 00:29:41,588
Did you have a chance to find a good match for Eun Chul?

478
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:48,706
Excuse me, Mrs. Kim is talking to me right now.

479
00:29:48,706 --> 00:29:50,588
Why are you being so mannerless?

480
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:52,023
Is that so?

481
00:29:52,023 --> 00:29:53,583
I'm sorry.

482
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:57,382
I'll mind my manners, and just talk to her for one minute.

483
00:29:57,382 --> 00:29:59,693
Did you find a good match?

484
00:29:59,693 --> 00:30:01,763
I'll make sure to reward you.

485
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:05,286
Yes! This works out.

486
00:30:05,286 --> 00:30:07,615
This is exactly what you've been wanting.

487
00:30:07,615 --> 00:30:12,361
Her son graduated from Seoul University and he will soon pass the bar exam.

488
00:30:12,361 --> 00:30:13,936
That's great.

489
00:30:13,936 --> 00:30:15,555
This must be fate.

490
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,534
Not all law school students become prosecutors and judges.

491
00:30:21,534 --> 00:30:23,795
How can you try to match my daughter to that bum?

492
00:30:23,795 --> 00:30:25,148
He's so low class.

493
00:30:25,912 --> 00:30:29,352
How dare you call my precious son a bum?

494
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:30,478
Oh my...

495
00:30:31,343 --> 00:30:35,043
Your temper hasn't changed at all since then.

496
00:30:35,043 --> 00:30:37,035
Not changed since then?

497
00:30:37,711 --> 00:30:39,879
I know I've seen this woman before.

498
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,196
We saw each other nine years ago inside

499
00:30:43,196 --> 00:30:45,544
the conference room at Culture Girl's High School.

500
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:49,090
Your daughter was such a bad influence on my daughter.

501
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:50,828
She got suspended because of her.

502
00:30:51,538 --> 00:30:52,759
So upsetting...

503
00:30:53,693 --> 00:30:56,449
Yeah. Now that I look at you, you are that nasty woman.

504
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,173
Let's only speak the truth.

505
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:00,381
Everyone knows that Young Mi was the school thug.

506
00:31:00,381 --> 00:31:03,318
- Who was the bad influence on whom?
- What did you say?

507
00:31:03,318 --> 00:31:05,980
- That's such nonsense...
- And...

508
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,532
I would never marry my son off to a low class

509
00:31:08,532 --> 00:31:11,085
loan shark family even if it means he'll never get married.

510
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:12,187
Stop dreaming.

511
00:31:12,187 --> 00:31:13,925
Why are you doing this?

512
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:16,428
Loan shark family?

513
00:31:16,428 --> 00:31:19,218
Low class?

514
00:31:19,728 --> 00:31:24,278
Our family financially backed the Korean army during the Japanese occupation.

515
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:25,815
We are a respected family.

516
00:31:25,815 --> 00:31:26,855
...

517
00:31:26,855 --> 00:31:30,281
Is that why your daughter walks around, collecting

518
00:31:30,281 --> 00:31:33,709
money wearing a skirt the size of my hand?

519
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:35,844
What the heck...

520
00:31:35,844 --> 00:31:37,359
How disrespectful...

521
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,318
Are you insulting my baby's style?

522
00:31:46,870 --> 00:31:48,576
Honey...

523
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:52,538
Something really bad happened to me.

524
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:55,818
Yeah, come pick me up.

525
00:31:55,818 --> 00:31:57,250
Okay.

526
00:31:57,870 --> 00:31:59,111
Okay.

527
00:32:00,112 --> 00:32:01,709
What the heck.

528
00:32:02,405 --> 00:32:03,770
Mrs. Kim...

529
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:08,877
I will never become an in-law with that family, please find another girl.

530
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:11,937
I can't believe her...

531
00:32:15,795 --> 00:32:18,057
Honey, where are you?

532
00:32:44,946 --> 00:32:48,697
<i>Why is my stomach hurting all of a sudden?</i>

533
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,365
<i>No.</i>

534
00:32:51,413 --> 00:32:52,999
<i>Get a hold of yourself, Kim Eun Chul.</i>

535
00:32:52,999 --> 00:32:54,376
<i>Get a hold of yourself.</i>

536
00:32:56,669 --> 00:33:00,625
<i>I'll have to take out a loan, or tell Bom to take money out of her account.</i>

537
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:11,946
<i>This is the last time.</i>

538
00:33:11,946 --> 00:33:13,500
<i>Don't worry.</i>

539
00:33:33,317 --> 00:33:35,985
<i>I have faith in you.</i>

540
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:41,421
<i>You must become a judge or a prosecutor, okay?</i>

541
00:33:45,016 --> 00:33:46,219
Hey!

542
00:33:46,219 --> 00:33:47,297
Are you okay?

543
00:33:47,297 --> 00:33:49,168
Get a hold of yourself! Look here!

544
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:50,771
Hello?

545
00:33:50,771 --> 00:33:51,985
Hey!

546
00:33:52,451 --> 00:33:53,377
Hey!

547
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:59,328
Her phone is turned off.

548
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,390
Did Park Ji Young come out to work today?

549
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:03,561
Yes.

550
00:34:03,853 --> 00:34:05,268
Do you know where she is?

551
00:34:05,268 --> 00:34:08,715
She was sitting alone on top of the building steps a while ago.

552
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,427
I don't know about now.

553
00:34:11,186 --> 00:34:13,672
It's almost time for her shift. I wonder where she went...

554
00:34:14,251 --> 00:34:15,873
Okay, thank you.

555
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:27,603
[Will]

556
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,410
Ji Young!

557
00:34:39,658 --> 00:34:40,729
No!

558
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:43,734
Don't come near me.

559
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:48,484
Ji Young, why are you doing this? Don't do this.

560
00:34:48,484 --> 00:34:50,783
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

561
00:34:54,422 --> 00:34:57,059
It's not like I don't understand how you feel.

562
00:34:57,059 --> 00:34:59,073
But this isn't right.

563
00:34:59,073 --> 00:35:01,019
Think about your mom and sister.

564
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:02,586
No.

565
00:35:02,979 --> 00:35:08,327
If I want to help my mom and sister,I need to disappear.

566
00:35:08,853 --> 00:35:10,404
Ji Young.

567
00:35:12,514 --> 00:35:17,668
The loan sharks went to look for my mom at her work this morning.

568
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:21,358
She was so shocked, she fainted.

569
00:35:22,801 --> 00:35:26,302
If I die, at least she won't have to pay back the loan.

570
00:35:26,742 --> 00:35:29,448
I have a way to get that money back.

571
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:33,010
So, don't do this scary thing.

572
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,077
Please just trust me.

573
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:40,132
I'll make sure you get all your money back.

574
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:44,215
So, please come down.

575
00:35:44,215 --> 00:35:45,826
It's too dangerous.

576
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:58,314
Are you okay?

577
00:36:00,349 --> 00:36:01,818
Let's go.

578
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,189
Let go of me! I need to go.

579
00:36:16,003 --> 00:36:17,914
Calm down. You can't go.

580
00:36:17,914 --> 00:36:19,001
Let go!

581
00:36:19,001 --> 00:36:22,047
- I need to go in to take the exam.
- Calm down.

582
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,783
You can't go in during the exam.

583
00:36:23,783 --> 00:36:25,300
That's the rule.

584
00:36:29,007 --> 00:36:32,081
This exam means everything to me...

585
00:36:32,798 --> 00:36:35,251
I can't give up like this.

586
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:40,396
I can't give up!

587
00:36:42,256 --> 00:36:44,509
I need to take that exam.

588
00:36:48,818 --> 00:36:50,818
I bet he won't even give me back a penny.

589
00:36:50,818 --> 00:36:53,243
How am I going to get him to give me 10 million won?

590
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,305
This mouth is the problem.

591
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:58,189
So why did you make such a bold claim?

592
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,648
What else could I do? I had to save her life first.

593
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:09,880
She even wrote out her will, and she was about to jump from the rooftop.

594
00:37:12,838 --> 00:37:14,162
What do I do?

595
00:37:14,162 --> 00:37:16,671
It's no use suing that quack.

596
00:37:16,671 --> 00:37:18,945
Of course, you don't have 10 million won, right?

597
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,692
Should I borrow it from Young Mi?

598
00:37:21,692 --> 00:37:25,502
But why are you so fervently trying to help this customer?

599
00:37:25,502 --> 00:37:27,207
You know her?

600
00:37:27,657 --> 00:37:28,586
Huh?

601
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:32,579
Yeah, I know her.

602
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,416
You see...

603
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:37,912
She's my friend's in-law's cousin's sister.

604
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,841
If it's that close...

605
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:42,858
you should definitely help her out.

606
00:37:43,384 --> 00:37:47,530
The best thing would be to make that quack cough up the money himself.

607
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,070
I know.

608
00:37:59,461 --> 00:38:02,224
I have a good idea.

609
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:15,983
Hey!

610
00:38:15,983 --> 00:38:17,382
Let's do that right now.

611
00:38:17,382 --> 00:38:18,764
Let's go.

612
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:19,876
Let's go...

613
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:34,296
I'm almost finished with taking care of my son.

614
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,155
I made him into a judge.

615
00:38:36,155 --> 00:38:39,376
It would be perfect if I can get a doctor daughter-in-law.

616
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,604
I'm getting so annoyed thinking about it.

617
00:38:46,604 --> 00:38:49,713
How dare she try to match him up with a daughter of a loan shark.

618
00:38:49,713 --> 00:38:52,198
Wait until Eun Chul becomes a judge...

619
00:38:52,198 --> 00:38:56,342
I'll get him to investigate that family, and punish them!

620
00:38:59,832 --> 00:39:01,831
The rice is ready.

621
00:39:01,831 --> 00:39:03,838
Let's see...What time is it?

622
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:05,394
Oh my God.

623
00:39:05,394 --> 00:39:08,694
It's almost time for my hope and dreams to come home.

624
00:39:08,694 --> 00:39:10,309
Rib eye roll...Rib eye roll...

625
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:11,940
Rib eye roll!

626
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,684
Yeah, I'm on my way to deposit the money we got today.

627
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:19,452
Okay, I'll see you there.

628
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:21,677
Nice.

629
00:39:30,692 --> 00:39:32,831
<i>You can't go in during the exam.</i>

630
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:34,390
<i>That's the rule.</i>

631
00:39:51,673 --> 00:39:52,591
Son!

632
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:58,826
You shouldn't have come out, it's so cold.

633
00:39:58,826 --> 00:40:01,993
Son, of course I should come out when you just took that exam.

634
00:40:01,993 --> 00:40:03,662
You went through so much in this cold.

635
00:40:03,662 --> 00:40:04,386
Right...

636
00:40:05,082 --> 00:40:07,291
Did you do well on the exam?

637
00:40:09,305 --> 00:40:10,439
Of course.

638
00:40:10,439 --> 00:40:12,865
I don't even need to wait for the results from the first round.

639
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:14,983
I'm going to start preparing for the second round right away.

640
00:40:14,983 --> 00:40:17,461
Of course, Judge Kim.

641
00:40:17,461 --> 00:40:18,440
Right...

642
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,182
I wanted to nourish your body...

643
00:40:21,182 --> 00:40:24,208
So I went and bought some rib eye rolls.

644
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,604
Let's go.

645
00:40:36,529 --> 00:40:39,863
I didn't know it would be this easy to fool people when we started.

646
00:40:39,863 --> 00:40:42,630
It's best to target those who are in despair.

647
00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:46,961
Yeah! But don't you think we've stayed too long in one location?

648
00:40:46,961 --> 00:40:49,813
I think we might get caught for fraud, we should move to a different region.

649
00:40:49,813 --> 00:40:51,497
- We should.
- Yeah.

650
00:40:51,497 --> 00:40:54,987
I don't feel good about that girl, Park Ji Young, catching onto us.

651
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:56,822
- I don't have a good feeling about it.
- Let's go.

652
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,778
It's you again?

653
00:41:01,416 --> 00:41:04,121
I can't return her money.

654
00:41:04,121 --> 00:41:08,706
And tell that girl, Park Ji Young, or whatever...

655
00:41:08,706 --> 00:41:11,038
She should sue us if she feels wronged.

656
00:41:11,038 --> 00:41:11,860
Sue?

657
00:41:12,362 --> 00:41:14,314
She can't do that even if she wants to.

658
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:16,445
My friend...

659
00:41:18,331 --> 00:41:19,689
She died.

660
00:41:21,033 --> 00:41:24,211
Because of the loans she took out to pay you...

661
00:41:24,211 --> 00:41:28,800
she threw herself into the river in her hometown.

662
00:41:29,693 --> 00:41:31,494
When was that?

663
00:41:31,494 --> 00:41:32,724
Last night!

664
00:41:33,827 --> 00:41:36,121
How could this happen?

665
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,608
- That was her will.
- Will?

666
00:41:41,613 --> 00:41:43,224
Mother, I'm sorry.

667
00:41:43,224 --> 00:41:45,326
I'm sorry, my sister, Ji Hee.

668
00:41:45,326 --> 00:41:49,971
I won't let that fortune teller get off easy for doing this to me.

669
00:41:49,971 --> 00:41:53,587
I'm going to get my revenge on him in my death.

670 
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,597
What do we do?

671
00:41:57,277 --> 00:42:01,215
Hey, are you trying to threaten us with this?

672
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:03,903
You killed an innocent person.

673
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,992
I can't let you sleep in comfort.

674
00:42:05,992 --> 00:42:08,168
I didn't kill anyone!

675
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:12,121
Return that money to Ji Young's mom right now.

676
00:42:12,121 --> 00:42:13,591
Otherwise...

677
00:42:14,195 --> 00:42:18,463
my friend's restless spirit will put a curse on you.

678
00:42:24,518 --> 00:42:27,457
Hey, something's weird here.

679
00:42:28,198 --> 00:42:29,586
What?

680
00:42:29,586 --> 00:42:30,684
I mean...

681
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:35,063
She said the girl died last night, but she called early this morning.

682
00:42:35,063 --> 00:42:37,390
She was crying and asking back for the money.

683
00:42:37,390 --> 00:42:39,046
I'm sure you are mistaken.

684
00:42:39,046 --> 00:42:40,911
Did you fall asleep drunk last night?

685
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:42,554
No, this is weird.

686
00:42:42,554 --> 00:42:45,313
Let's give back all that money, and go back to our hometown.

687
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,497
Shut up.

688
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,448
There are no such things as ghosts.

689
00:42:48,448 --> 00:42:50,065
Stop talking nonsense.

690
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:52,481
Look for a new house for us to move into tomorrow.

691
00:42:59,005 --> 00:43:00,626
Feels so crummy...

692
00:43:00,626 --> 00:43:03,345
I should be careful who I cheat in the future.

693
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:10,606
Is the lightbulb out?

694
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:13,467
I told him to change the bulb.

695
00:43:17,619 --> 00:43:18,394
Cold!

696
00:43:18,725 --> 00:43:22,279
Seriously, why is there water here?

697
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:24,640
I told Min Soo to clean up before leaving.

698
00:43:25,284 --> 00:43:26,923
Let's see...

699
00:43:27,305 --> 00:43:29,655
Where's that towel?

700
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:36,024
What's this?

701
00:43:36,451 --> 00:43:38,332
They're footsteps.

702
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:44,786
<i>She left a will last night, and threw herself into the river.</i>

703
00:43:46,443 --> 00:43:47,484
No way...

704
00:43:47,484 --> 00:43:49,009
No way.

705
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:52,492
Min Soo probably just left in the middle of cleaning up.

706
00:43:53,827 --> 00:43:55,201
I should change.

707
00:44:28,328 --> 00:44:29,521
Let's go.

708
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:37,171
[I'll get my revenge.]

709
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,123
Cellphone!

710
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,256
Cellphone...

711
00:44:47,532 --> 00:44:49,065
Why isn't this turning on?

712
00:44:49,065 --> 00:44:51,315
Why isn't the power turning on?

713
00:44:55,569 --> 00:44:57,032
What's this?

714
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:02,480
Please turn off...

715
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:04,595
Turn off.

716
00:45:04,595 --> 00:45:06,708
Please turn off.

717
00:45:13,974 --> 00:45:15,934
What's this?

718
00:45:16,604 --> 00:45:18,251
Why isn't the door opening?

719
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,251
Min Soo?

720
00:45:21,546 --> 00:45:22,735
Min Soo?

721
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:24,202
Is it Min Soo?

722
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,634
<i>Even if it's in my death,I'm going to get</i>

723
00:45:30,634 --> 00:45:33,126
<i>revenge on the one who did this to me.</i>

724
00:45:34,791 --> 00:45:37,916
<i>My friend's restless spirit will put a curse on you.</i>

725 
00:45:44,822 --> 00:45:47,810
He won't be able to do anything bad ever again.

726
00:45:48,355 --> 00:45:50,385
What a tragic end to a crook...

727
00:45:50,385 --> 00:45:52,596
He's getting what he deserves.

728
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:05,710
Thanks to you, I was able to get all my money back.

729
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:09,505
It's not easy to help out someone you hardly know.

730
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:12,671
I don't know how to thank you.

731
00:46:12,671 --> 00:46:13,657
No...

732
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,389
That bastard...

733
00:46:16,823 --> 00:46:21,025
Those crooks need to be taught a lesson.

734
00:46:21,462 --> 00:46:25,305
That way, there won't be any more victims like you, Ji Young.

735
00:46:25,305 --> 00:46:26,265
Yeah.

736
00:46:26,265 --> 00:46:30,921
You were probably freaked out to pretend that you were dead...

737
00:46:30,921 --> 00:46:34,756
And I'm sure it felt strange giving me your will...

738
00:46:34,756 --> 00:46:37,336
I'm sorry for asking you to do those things.

739
00:46:38,099 --> 00:46:40,498
Don't worry about that.

740
00:46:40,498 --> 00:46:45,811
If it weren't for you, I would never have been able to get back on my feet.

741
00:46:46,298 --> 00:46:47,229
Right...

742
00:46:54,465 --> 00:46:56,951
I finished dry cleaning your clothes.

743
00:46:56,951 --> 00:46:59,260
You said you have an interview today.

744
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,435
You should wear this.

745
00:47:01,435 --> 00:47:03,347
Thank you.

746
00:47:03,347 --> 00:47:05,127
I'll get going.

747
00:47:05,127 --> 00:47:06,545
Good luck on your interview.

748
00:47:06,545 --> 00:47:08,243
Ji Young, fighting!

749
00:47:10,756 --> 00:47:11,654
Bye.

750
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,282
Bye.

751
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,934
Pretty...

752
00:47:57,412 --> 00:48:01,952
I'm sure if I wear black stockings, it'll cover up the burn scars.

753
00:48:08,121 --> 00:48:12,229
This is a perfect outfit to wear on a movie date with the man of your dreams.

754
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:32,975
This would be perfect for Bom.

755
00:48:32,975 --> 00:48:34,488
Should I get it for her?

756
00:48:35,488 --> 00:48:36,393
No...

757
00:48:36,932 --> 00:48:39,052
You are not her boyfriend, Yong Soo Chul.

758
00:48:39,532 --> 00:48:41,131
Stop overdoing it.

759
00:48:54,623 --> 00:48:55,693
Ki Joon.

760
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:06,956
Who's she?

761
00:49:13,243 --> 00:49:14,215
Bom!

762
00:49:18,724 --> 00:49:20,515
You came early.

763
00:49:20,515 --> 00:49:21,573
Yeah.

764
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,898
I'm sorry for not letting you know earlier.

765
00:49:28,898 --> 00:49:31,394
My girlfriend really wanted to see this movie.

766
00:49:31,394 --> 00:49:33,914
I brought her out so I can introduce her to you, too.

767
00:49:38,050 --> 00:49:40,623
I heard a lot about you from Ki Joon.

768
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:43,307
I'm Yoo Min Young.

769
00:49:47,457 --> 00:49:48,465
Bom?

770
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:50,676
Bom.

771
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:54,516
Huh?

772
00:49:55,215 --> 00:49:57,488
It's nice to meet you.

773
00:50:00,516 --> 00:50:02,003
Yes.

774
00:50:04,733 --> 00:50:07,087
Let's go in. It's time.

775
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:08,444
Wait.

776
00:50:10,148 --> 00:50:12,528
I just remembered.

777
00:50:12,528 --> 00:50:17,984
I... left the stove on at home.

778
00:50:17,984 --> 00:50:19,969
I should hurry back.

779
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:21,849
Nobody's home?

780
00:50:21,849 --> 00:50:24,180
No, nobody's home.

781
00:50:24,703 --> 00:50:26,356
I should hurry back.

782
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:28,739
I'm sorry.

783
00:50:34,193 --> 00:50:35,414
Bom...

784
00:50:37,025 --> 00:50:39,452
Bom, we should watch a movie next time.

785
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:54,619
Watch where you are going.

786
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,202
Bom!

787
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,042
Bom, are you okay?

788
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:39,644
