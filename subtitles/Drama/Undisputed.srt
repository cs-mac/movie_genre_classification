Knockdown! Knockdown!

Another victory

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,759
I saw Louis the night
that he beat Braddock...

33
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,480
won the title. 1937.

34
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,358
Louis hits him
with a left and a right!

35
00:02:18,358 --> 00:02:19,680
And Braddock is down!

36
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,879
Straight right hand to the jaw.

37
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:24,158
Christ, they could've
counted to fifty.

38
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:26,560
He was the best heavyweight...

39
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,598
that ever fought
under the modern rules.

40
00:02:28,598 --> 00:02:30,718
No discussion, the best.

41
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:34,960
Then the fucking government
chased him about taxes.

42
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,680
Fucking IRS,
fucking bureaucrat assholes.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360

00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:41,120
in the west corner,
weighing in at 230 pounds...

54
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
wearing the green trunks
with the gold trim...

he's undefeated with
eight wins and no losses.

Representing
the State Prison at Loda...

the great white hope,
Vern Van Zant!

# Let me tell you boys
who you're messing with #

59
00:03:56,158 --> 00:03:57,560
Now in the east corner...

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,878
he's also undefeated
and defending champion,,,

61
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:03,000
with a record of
67 wins and no losses...

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,840
weighing in at 191 pounds...

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
wearing the burgundy trunks
with the black trim...

64
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,960
Sweetwater's own,
Monroe Hutchen!

65
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,598
All right now, shit birds,
y'all both know the rules.

66
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,438
I want a nice, clean fight,
nothing below the belt.

67
00:04:37,438 --> 00:04:40,120
You understand me? Let's box.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Now remember,
brother convicts,,,

69
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,000
if you learned how to act...

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
they wouldn't have to fight
inside of a cage.

71
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,838
And be on your
best behavior, too...

72
00:04:51,838 --> 00:04:53,560
Because we don't want
no incidents, all right?

73
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,879
Now, let's see what
the pride of Loda...

74
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,639
has to offer against
the great Monroe.

75
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
Give Hitler's cousin
his lunch, baby.

76
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,959
It's all you, baby!
It's all you!

77
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,519
Yeah! Come on now!

78
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:04,360
Come back
from the rail--get back,

79
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,278
And there go the bell.
Here we go.

80
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:12,879
Monroe comes out
and peppers him,,,

81
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,480
with a nice left hand,

82
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,959
And another left hand,

83
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,759
Monroe's
just feeling him out,,,

84
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,600
popping him with
a little left hand,

85
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,519
He going to shine that
bald head up, for sure,

86
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:26,480
Move your feet!
Oh, yeah, that's right!

87
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,240
Yeah! Yeah!

88
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,959
Beat the teeth out of
his mouth, Monroe!

89
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:31,160
Come on, man!

90
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:38,720
A left
and a right by Monroe!

91
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,160
This guy hasn't
tagged Monroe yet,

92
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,600
How in the hell
could you be 6-6, 280,,,

93
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,560
and look wobbly already? Ooh!

94
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,000
He's down! He's down!

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He's already down!
Vern Van Zant is down!

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,959
We're not even halfway
through the first round,,,

97
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,439
and he's already down!

98
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,959
Excuse me, sir,
we just got some big news.

99
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:02,879
The word is, the Iceman's
day of arrival is tomorrow.

100
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,519
E.T.A., 2 p.m.

101
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,480
Now, Vern Van Zant
said he got those...

102
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,360
brand-new tattoos
just for this occasion.

103
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,519
Well, Vern, don't look like...

104
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:11,399
the parry’s gonna last
too long for you.

105
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:15,480
This guy is a bum--
big, uncoordinated motherfucker.

106
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,800
Nine...

107
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,079
Look at me! You OK? Box!

108
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,079
Ah, here we go again!
Monroe's on the hunt.

109
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,720
Vern, swinging and a-missing,

110
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,278
Ooh! And another left,
right to the midsection,

111
00:06:29,278 --> 00:06:30,879
Left and right
uppercuts to the head!

112
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,759
Right to the head!
Right to the stomach,

113
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,480
This guy's just
a-swinging and a-missing!

114
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,959
Hits him with
a left and a right!

115
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:37,838
Monroe's just
tearing his ass up,

116
00:06:37,838 --> 00:06:41,000
Right in the face!
Right to the head!

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Left to the midsection!
Right to the head!

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,439
Another left and a right!

119
00:06:44,439 --> 00:06:45,959
Oh, my God,
he shined his head up!

120
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:47,879
I told you,
he's shinin' it up!

121
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:52,680
One more time for Monroe,

122
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,519
Knockout! Knockout!

123
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,040
One round, motherfucker!

124
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,199
That's it! That's it!

125
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:07,838
It's done! This fight is over!
Monroe wins again!

126
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,800
Spit it.

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,759
Yeah, but I got a little
announcement for you.

128
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:14,160
Got a little
announcement for you.

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,519
Little news bulletin.

130
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,560
Y'all been wondering
when that day is coming.

131
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,879
Well, that day is tomorrow.
He's coming to Sweetwater.

132
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,360
The so-called undisputed...

133
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,278
heavyweight champion
of the world...

134
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:27,800
George "Iceman" Chambers!

135
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
What do you say to that,
Monroe? You ready?

136
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,680
OK, here we go. Tape rolling.

137
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,278
Former world
heavyweight champion,,,

138
00:07:48,278 --> 00:07:50,000
George "Iceman" Chambers,,,

139
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,639
now you'll be moving
to a new home...

140
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,759
going to live with
murderers and thieves...

141
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,399
in California's newly-built...

142
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:57,278
Sweetwater Prison
in the Mojave Desert.

143
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:59,800
How's all this going for you?

144
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,278
I'll be OK.
I got a bad break.

145
00:08:03,278 --> 00:08:05,160
I just gotta
play this thing out.

146
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,240
Your lawyers have filed
all the expected appeals,,,

147
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,120
but realistically, what do
you think of your chances,,,

148
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,639
of getting out
before serving,,,

149
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,079
the full sentence
of 6 to 8 years?

150
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm not supposed to talk
about that legal stuff.

151
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,040
My people don't want me
commenting on that.

152
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,959
Boxing experts tend to agree...

153
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,399
that even as little
as two years in a prison...

154
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,759
without proper training
could mean the end...

155
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,920
for a boxer your age.
Now, you're regarded...

156
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,480
as one of the greatest
offensive fighters...

157
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,000
in the history of the sport...

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,360
an attacker
like Dempsey, Joe Louis,,,

159
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,240
Rocky Marciano, Joe Frazier,

160
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,959
Just exactly how
damaging to your skills,,,

161
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,879
is this prison stint
likely to be?

162
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,480
No damage.
I'll stay in shape, work out...

163
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,318
watch what I eat. I'll be fine.

164
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:51,199
But when an athlete
is removed from competition--

165
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:54,000
That's where you're making
one big mistake right off.

166
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,278
I'm not an athlete.
I'm a gladiator.

167
00:08:58,278 --> 00:08:59,840
How do you define that?

168
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,278
People play baseball.
Nobody plays boxing.

169
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:07,038
Iceman, last week after
you were convicted,,,

170
00:09:07,038 --> 00:09:10,038
boxing's various
so-called governing bodies...

171
00:09:10,038 --> 00:09:11,918
began stripping you of
your title belts...

172
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:13,278
stripping you--

173
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,000
Who they think they kidding?

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,840
Everybody knows I'm the champ.

175
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,960
And I'm gonna be the champ
till I quit.

176
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
This fight with
Manfredy is meant to be,,,

177
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,038
just a tune-up for
George "The Iceman" Chambers,,,

178
00:09:43,038 --> 00:09:44,600
hopefully leading
to the unification bout,,,

179
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,918
with Montel Briscoe,,,

180
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,519
undefeated holder
of the WBC crown,

181
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:51,038
The two biggest names in boxing
on a collision course,,,

182
00:09:51,038 --> 00:09:52,639
sometime next year,,,

183
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,678
assuming the Iceman gets by
the South American challenger,

184
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,759
[Club music plays]

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
It's round 1 and one to go,
and it's all Iceman!

186
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,200
He's stalking Manfredy,
chasing the big South American,

187
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,320
Iceman with a right,
another right,

188
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,918
Another right
and a left to the body!

189
00:10:14,918 --> 00:10:18,480
Oh, and a right-hand uppercut,
That staggered Manfredy!

190
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,519
Iceman stalking him,
He knows he's got him hurt,

191
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,399
Oh, body shots!
Right, left to the body!

192
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,918
Left hook and he's down!
He's down! He's down!

193
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:29,519
That's why they call him
the Iceman!

194
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,480
Well, Carlos Manfredy,,,

195
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,158
gets a one-way ticket
back to Brazil!

196
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,440
George "Iceman" Chambers,,,

197
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,960
remains undefeated
heavyweight champion!

198
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,360
And the big man on the block!

199
00:10:48,918 --> 00:10:51,320
Are you fighting Montel next?

200
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,519
Just another sucker who's
gonna get his ass whipped.

201
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,960
If the money's right,
bring on Montel.

202
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,840
Nobody's running,
nobody's ducking.

203
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,678
Nobody--l mean, nobody--
can stand up to what I got.

204
00:11:01,678 --> 00:11:03,038
Does that include Montel?

205
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,000
Oh, yeah, that damn sure
includes Montel.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
Mr. Lewis!

207
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,639
Estimates are up
to 300 million dollars...

208
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:12,240
for the pay-per-view
gate alone.

209
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,519
Any comment on that?

210
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,120
Let's make the deal first.

211
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,278
But my first guess is
you're a few million short.

212
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:21,480
And, Iceman,
it's nine months till summer.

213
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,798
What's next for you?

214
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,600
Well, first of all,
I'm gonna go to L.A...

215
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,038
you know, see some friends...

216
00:11:26,038 --> 00:11:27,918
then I'm gonna do
a little partying.

217
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Hey, hey...that's it.

218
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,558
I've done things in my life...

219
00:11:34,558 --> 00:11:36,519
maybe I shouldn't have.
I know that.

220
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:39,519
But I did not want to,
and I told him "No."

221
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,678
You'll be moving
into a new home,,,

222
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,879
going to live with
murderers and thieves,,,

223
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:52,240
in California's newly-built,,,

224
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,600
Sweetwater Prison
in the Mojave Desert,

225
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,240
Without getting into
legal strategy,,,

226
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
let's discuss your trial.

227
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,240
You continue to maintain
your innocence.

228
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,120
I didn't rape nobody.

229
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,080
I done a lot of wrong shit
in my life...

230
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,000
but I ain't no punk-ass rapist.

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,278
Look at me.
What I gotta rape somebody for?

232
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,240
Psst. Monroe.

233
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,759
You see him through the window?

234
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,759
Big deal's got his own
helicopter service...

235
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,600
instead of coming
in here on the bus.

236
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,639
He's the champ.

237
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,720
What's this shit?
Don't think negative, man.

238
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,158
I don't want to hear that shit.

239
00:12:53,158 --> 00:12:55,158
This is your house.
You own this place.

240
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,240
If this was my house,
I could get up and leave.

241
00:13:08,678 --> 00:13:09,960
He's here.

242
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,639
Just getting out
of the helicopter.

243
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,360
Maybe you'd like to meet him,
Mr. Ripstein.

244
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,440
I could bring him over.
You two could talk boxing.

245
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,480
I'll tell you when
I want to talk to him.

246
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,080
Why couldn't your high-priced
team of lawyers...

247
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,000
convince a judge and a jury?

248
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,480
Because I put people
in body bags on TV...

249
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,360
and get paid
a lot of money for it.

250
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,759
Because I'm a big, bad,
black motherfucker--

251
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,519
that's why nobody believes me.

252
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,200
I have received
over 170 requests...

253
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,480
for interviews with you,
Mr. Chambers.

254
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,080
Networks, local TV, cable...

255
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,080
ever newspaper organization
in the country...

256
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,200
foreign press, foreign TV--
you name it,

257
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,320
I have turned them all down,

258
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,720
Mr. Chambers,
here is Sweetwater,

259
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,519
Maximum security, level five...

260
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,240
state correctional
institution...

261
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,639
with nearly
seven hundred prisoners.

262
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,639
We house only murderers,
armed robbers, rapists,,,

263
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,320
and those with
connections to gangs,,,

264
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,399
and other forms
of organized crime.

265
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:15,240
The state is trying to
spare lesser criminals...

266
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,158
the contaminating influence
of these more hardened types.

267
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,519
Now, we don't want
any incidents that might add,,,

268
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,798
to your already great
difficulties, Mr. Chambers,

269
00:14:23,798 --> 00:14:25,759
This is Mr. Mercker.

270
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,200
He's the senior prison officer,
He's the head guard,

271
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,399
This is Ms. Early,
our administrative officer.

272
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,038
She can arrange
for religious counsel...

273
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,278
or instruction, if you wish.

274
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:37,960
Whatever.
I need a CD player and some CDs.

275
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,440
Now, I'll give you a list.

276
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,480
My people on the outside
will pay for it all.

277
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,240
Not possible
for the first six months.

278
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,639
It's a privilege,
has to be earned.

279
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,080
Any and all privileges,,,

280
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,558
will depend upon
your general conduct,

281
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:51,278
Mr. Chambers,
you have been convicted...

282
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,158
and sent here
for the crime of rape.

283
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,759
That's a very serious mater,

284
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,278
If you'd take advantage,,,

285
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:58,000
of this opportunity
to apologize,,,

286
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,120
to this woman
and to sports fans,,,

287
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,000
and the American public
for letting them down--

288
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,639
heck, even the former
president of the--

289
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:05,320
Man, fuck the president!

290
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,600
I ain't apologizing--

291
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,240
not to you, not to her,
not to nobody!

292
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,480
And you lucky I got this
damn gate between you and me...

293
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,399
or I’d rip you a new asshole,
you judgmental motherfucker!

294
00:15:15,918 --> 00:15:18,158
Another strong
athlete in the joint!

295
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:20,639
Welcome to Sweetwater,
Chambers!

296
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,480
If you
need anything, champ,,,

297
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,759
I got you covered,

298
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,240
Hey, champ!
Seen all your fights, man!

299
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:47,240
You got a name?

300
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,200
Mingo.

301
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,639
Mingo, move your shit,
stay out of my way...

302
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:58,399
and we'll get along just fine.

303
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:06,879
Hey, listen. It's an honor
to be cellmates with you.

304
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,918
I don't want no trouble, champ.

305
00:16:08,918 --> 00:16:12,000
No trouble. You just gonna
stay out of my way.

306
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,519
He just thinks he's the king.

307
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,278
Because he's the heavyweight
champ, he's the man.

308
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:18,440
Well, for some of us others,
we have rights, too...

309
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,080
and I had the right to say no
if I didn't want to.

310
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,440
I want everybody
to keep your distance.

311
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,759
I don't need to make
no new friends...

312
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,120
or hear no sad stories
on why they're here.

313
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,360
I got my own sad story for that.

314
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,600
I ain't loanin' nobody
no money...

315
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,320
so you tell them don't even ask.

316
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,600
And I don't want
nobody talking to me...

317
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,080
unless I talk to them first.

318
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,678
-You got that?
-Got it.

319
00:16:43,678 --> 00:16:45,840
"Leave the champ alone."

320
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,678
I know boxing.

321
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:58,320
I seen a lot of fights.

322
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,558
You're a good champeen,

323
00:17:01,558 --> 00:17:03,038
Who the hell are you?

324
00:17:03,038 --> 00:17:04,840
This is Mendy Ripstein.

325
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,440
He's a very important man
in here.

326
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,960
Ripstein,

327
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:12,200
Yeah, my manager, Yank Lewis,
he told me to say hello.

328
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,558
I don't remember him.

329
00:17:13,558 --> 00:17:15,960
He said you two
were friends in Miami...

330
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,918
about twenty-five years ago.

331
00:17:17,918 --> 00:17:21,038
I didn't have
any friends in Miami.

332
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:24,639
A lot of people, they say
they knew me from the old days.

333
00:17:24,639 --> 00:17:26,278
They're full of shit.

334
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,440
You're a good champeen...

335
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,798
but we got a champeen
right here...

336
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,519
and he can kick your ass.

337
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,920
Kiddin' me.

338
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,440
I watch all your fights.
You're not as good as you were.

339
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,838
You're just looking
for one big punch.

340
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:48,519
You're not
throwing combinations.

341
00:17:48,519 --> 00:17:52,200
You're not using as much
head movement on defense.

342
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, right, old man.

343
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,640
I'm just knocking
motherfuckers out.

344
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,038
Who's the punk in here
you got in mind?

345
00:17:58,038 --> 00:18:02,078
Oh, did I hurt your feelings?

346
00:18:02,078 --> 00:18:04,720
Fuck you.

347
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,480
Heh. Monroe.
Name's Monroe Hutchen.

348
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:16,118
Mr. Ripstein thinks
he can whip up on you, man...

349
00:18:16,118 --> 00:18:20,278
but no offense. Not trying
to cause any trouble here.

350
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:45,480
# Hey, yo, it's real in here #

351
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,440
# All of these contenders know
just how it feels in here #

352
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,680
# When you're trin'
to be the top boss #

353
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,000
# Put your gloves on, then #

354
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,318
# This here
be the sport of men #

355
00:18:51,318 --> 00:18:52,680
# Everybody
wants a shot at me #

356
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,960
# One word,
you get knocked out #

357
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,400
# Rocked out the box #

358
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,838
# Only men
leave a place like this #

359
00:18:56,838 --> 00:18:58,440
# Hardcore,
I'm in your face like this #

360
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,960
# Tell your mama that
you'll never come home #

361
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,160
# Tell your mama that
you'll never come home #

362
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,880
Which one of these suckers
in here is Monroe Hutchen?

363
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,318
He's over there in line,
wearing a white cap.

364
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:25,078
What's happening, Mo? Yeah.

365
00:19:25,078 --> 00:19:27,440
Brought in
some big guys in here.

366
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,240
He beat them all.

367
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,720
It ain't only about being big.

368
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,118
You gotta have skill, son.

369
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,640
You Monroe Hutchen?

370
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:51,798
Yep.

371
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:55,278
I guess you know who I am.

372
00:19:55,278 --> 00:19:58,838
Are you the champion in here?

373
00:19:58,838 --> 00:20:00,088
Yeah.

374
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,160
Not the heavyweight champ.

375
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,240
Champion...

376
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,759
heavyweight or
any other kind they got.

377
00:20:10,759 --> 00:20:15,519
I didn't even know they had
boxing in a place like this.

378
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:18,078
Well, it's a special program.

379
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:20,558
We only get bouts
ever six months.

380
00:20:20,558 --> 00:20:23,358
Mostly we fight guys
from other prisons.

381
00:20:23,358 --> 00:20:25,720
How long you been on top?

382
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,318
Ten years.
Ever since I got in here.

383
00:20:29,318 --> 00:20:33,200
Damn. Brother, that's
a real fine record you got.

384
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,798
I gotta congratulate you.

385
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,118
Yeah! You want some of this?

386
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,798
Yeah! Come on!

387
00:20:39,798 --> 00:20:41,598
I'm gonna win.

388
00:20:41,598 --> 00:20:43,680
Come on! What?

389
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,400
Ain't no champ in here but me!

390
00:20:48,278 --> 00:20:51,078
I'm giving you another chance.

391
00:20:51,078 --> 00:20:53,880
I'm inclined to overlook
what happened this afternoon,,,

392
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,838
and not make it a part of
your official record,

393
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,558
Look, let's get something
straight, Mr. Warden.

394
00:21:01,558 --> 00:21:05,078
I'm not just some convict
doing five to ten.

395
00:21:05,078 --> 00:21:08,480
I'm a real big deal.

396
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,720
Not only am I
heavyweight champ...

397
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:13,759
I'm close to being the most
famous man in the world.

398
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,318
So if you think
you're gonna lean on me...

399
00:21:15,318 --> 00:21:16,838
like these punks
you got in here...

400
00:21:16,838 --> 00:21:18,038
you better think again...

401
00:21:18,038 --> 00:21:20,078
because if anything
happens to me...

402
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:23,798
it's gonna be on
the 6:00 news worldwide.

403
00:21:23,798 --> 00:21:25,400
There's gonna be
a whole lot of people...

404
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,400
askin' a whole lot
of questions...

405
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,400
and you and your little crew
here better know that.

406
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,358
Just my luck he got sent here.

407
00:21:31,358 --> 00:21:34,440
Iceman, my ass.
He's just another goddamn thug.

408
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,519
One who happens
to be a world champion...

409
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:39,358
and a potential
public relations nightmare.

410
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:49,480
Mr. Hutchen.

411
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,038
You know the little problem...

412
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:53,240
you had with
the Iceman yesterday?

413
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,960
Got you in some trouble.

414
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,759
Heavyweight champ.

415
00:21:58,759 --> 00:22:00,880
Man gave me a cheap shot.

416
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,358
Yeah, I know,

417
00:22:02,358 --> 00:22:04,038
By the court
and the higher powers,,,

418
00:22:04,038 --> 00:22:06,798
you contributed to a situation
that threatened violence.

419
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:09,278
One thing you ought
to know by now, Monroe,

420
00:22:09,278 --> 00:22:12,358
Life ain't fair,
Not fair at all,

421
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,960
The warden understands,,,

422
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,598
what he's doing
is unfortunate,,,

423
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:25,798
but unless Mr. Hutchen
and the Iceman are separated,,,

424
00:22:25,798 --> 00:22:27,240
there will be
enormous pressure,,,

425
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,480
for another
physical confrontation,

426
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,920
Nobody likes this...

427
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,838
but Mr. Hutchen's presence
is an incitement to violence...

428
00:22:32,838 --> 00:22:35,400
and he will be kept in there
until such time...

429
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,880
as we can make arrangements for
his travel to another facility.

430
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,230
OK.

431
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,558
Hey, Monroe.

432
00:22:53,558 --> 00:22:55,519
Take care of yourself
in there, Monroe.

433
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:01,278
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

434
00:23:01,278 --> 00:23:03,480
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

435
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,920
Sergeant Marinez
to the hill tower,

436
00:23:09,519 --> 00:23:11,838
New duty roster just got posted.

437
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:14,960
You're working
in the kitchen with me.

438
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,558
Look, since we're gonna
be stuck together...

439
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:21,160
what you in here for?

440
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,118
You know, champ,
I don't mean to be...

441
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:25,960
telling you what to do
or anything, but...

442
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:30,078
it's not considered polite
to ask why we're here.

443
00:23:30,078 --> 00:23:33,118
Kinda violation of the ethics.
You know, the code?

444
00:23:33,118 --> 00:23:34,278
Yeah.

445
00:23:34,278 --> 00:23:37,598
People take it as disrespect.

446
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:41,838
Yo! You keeping in shape,
Mr. Iceman?

447
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,838
Who's this chump?

448
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:48,440
Call him Ratbag.
Runs with Monroe.

449
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,598
Shit.

450
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:51,598
Thinks he's his manager,

451
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:54,240
-Ratbag?
-Ratbag.

452
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,240
OK, Ratbag,
what you in here for?

453
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,880
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

454
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:09,798
Arson.

455
00:24:09,798 --> 00:24:13,798
Nothin' up close and personal.

456
00:24:13,798 --> 00:24:16,160
You hit people much?

457
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,880
What do you mean?

458
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,038
You know, punch people.

459
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:22,480
When you were a kid
or since you been in here.

460
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,440
Sometimes. Not much.

461
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,240
I never was the physical type.

462
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,078
You want to hit me?

463
00:24:30,078 --> 00:24:33,920
What, are you kidding?

464
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,038
You can say you did it.

465
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:37,920
"I punched
the heavyweight champ."

466
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,318
You can tell people
all about it.

467
00:24:39,318 --> 00:24:40,480
It might even make you...

468
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,960
feel good about
your little punk-ass self.

469
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,558
I don't want to hit you, Iceman.
Shit!

470
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:46,720
Sure you do!

471
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,640
You don't even like me.
Come on, man.

472
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,920
Go crazy. Let one go.

473
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,278
If I hit you just this once,
will that end it?

474
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:54,759
I won't have to hit you anymore?

475
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,920
All you gotta do
is hit me one time...

476
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,240
and I'm telling you, man,
it'll make you feel good...

477
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,798
and it ain't gonna hurt me none.

478
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,558
Aright. Just once.

479
00:25:03,558 --> 00:25:05,880
Just to satisfy whatever
weird trip you're on...

480
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,078
and show you
that I'm a good guy...

481
00:25:07,078 --> 00:25:08,680
trying to do what you want.

482
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,960
Right. Thank you.

483
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,278
You're welcome.

484
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,038
Unh!

485
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:17,598
Ohh! Yeah, baby!

486
00:25:17,598 --> 00:25:21,278
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
I hit the Iceman!

487
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:22,440
Yo!

488
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,118
-Yeah!
-Thank you.

489
00:25:27,118 --> 00:25:28,920
You still feel good, Ratbag?

490
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,200
Yeah. I guess so.

491
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,078
You're not mad, are you?

492
00:25:33,078 --> 00:25:34,838
Ohh! Damn!

493
00:25:34,838 --> 00:25:36,680
No, I'm not mad at you.

494
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,558
Now, you go tell Monroe
what I said.

495
00:25:39,558 --> 00:25:41,480
Ain't but one champ in here!

496
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,038
And it ain't some
nickel-and-dime convict,,,

497
00:25:44,038 --> 00:25:45,960
beating up on fools in prison!

498
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,078
Get that bitch outta here.

499
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:56,680
# Yo, assemble the criminals #

500
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,400
# With subliminal
brought to the forefront #

501
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:03,400
# Hey, ain't nobody
know I'm in here #

502
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,318
# Check me, you'll learn
to respect me #

503
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:06,798
# Homeboy, don't correct me #

504
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:08,278
# I'll call you out,
step on necks #

505
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:09,720
# Man, I'm better,
stand over #

506
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,358
# Took out them cocky,
wanna be Rocky #

507
00:26:11,358 --> 00:26:13,160
# Niggers that ran up
from the outside #

508
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,880
# The inside my metal cell #

509
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,680
# Who the hell
wanna star bitching #

510
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,118
# Get across in the kitchen #

511
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,720
# End up in the infirmary #

512
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,960
# On close watch, talk shit #

513
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,358
# That ass will get muted #

514
00:26:22,358 --> 00:26:23,720
# Fuckin' with the undisputed #

515
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,318
I ain't gotta spend my time
makin' potato salad.

516
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:29,000
Where I come from...

517
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,318
we didn't have
any kind of salads.

518
00:26:31,318 --> 00:26:33,558
Where's that?

519
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:36,920
Indian country. Oklahoma.

520
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Hmm.

521
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:40,519
Look, man, I know
I'm not supposed to ask...

522
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,240
but what you in here for?

523
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,000
I stole some rich guy's
Mercedes in L.A.

524
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:52,160
I got a Mercedes. Three of them.

525
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:56,960
Mr. Hutchen.

526
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,000
It's Darlene Early, the G.A.O.
General administration officer.

527
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,759
I need to do
the interview and paperwork...

528
00:27:03,759 --> 00:27:05,558
for your transfer to Folsom.

529
00:27:05,558 --> 00:27:08,680
How are your spirits?
I want you to know...

530
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,318
I'm not in favor
of solitary confinement.

531
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:13,038
Not for you,
not for anybody else.

532
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:15,000
It's OK in here.

533
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,480
You can't be serious.

534
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,598
It's all a prison.

535
00:27:19,598 --> 00:27:22,000
I live inside my head.

536
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,680
So that's how
you're doing your time?

537
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,880
Are you really that much
in control of your emotions?

538
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:32,798
Been that way all my life.

539
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,519
Only time I ever lost it
is what got me in here.

540
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:40,480
Yeah. I'm familiar
with your case history.

541
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,558
So you prefer your own company?

542
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:45,519
Most of the time.

543
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:47,880
I am supposed to recommend
whether or not...

544
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,880
you seem to require a detailed
psychiatric evaluation.

545
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,680
Other than the incident
in the mess hall--

546
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,278
That wasn't me.

547
00:27:54,278 --> 00:27:57,598
Why don't you
go talk to the hotshot champ?

548
00:27:57,598 --> 00:27:59,200
Ask him about it.

549
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
So you deny any responsibility?

550
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,838
Yeah, I deny it. How does
that affect me movin' on?

551
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:08,078
This has no bearing
in your transfer to Folsom.

552
00:28:11,078 --> 00:28:12,960
You know, this whole thing...

553
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,078
this whole thing
is about people bein' scared.

554
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,240
Aren't you afraid of him?

555
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,240
Afraid. Shit, no.

556
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,798
He's a fighter. I'm a fighter.

557
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,440
If I'm better on that day,
I win.

558
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,920
That's just the way it goes.

559
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,440
Someday, every fighter loses.

560
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,118
Sooner or later,
somebody comes along...

561
00:28:32,118 --> 00:28:34,720
and they got your ticket.

562
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,118
Too old, just wasn't your day,
whatever the reason is.

563
00:28:39,118 --> 00:28:42,759
in the end,
everybody gets beaten.

564
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,640
The most you can hope for
is that you stay on top a while.

565
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,160
Be the best.

566
00:28:54,838 --> 00:28:57,118
I tried to say hello
to that old gangster.

567
00:28:57,118 --> 00:28:59,640
Ripstein.
He said he don't remember you.

568
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,759
He remembers.
He just don't want to admit it.

569
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:04,798
Standard mob procedure.

570
00:29:04,798 --> 00:29:06,920
Guys like him deny
they ever had a mother.

571
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,160
Yeah. Right.

572
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,680
How you makin' out, man?

573
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,960
It's shit, but I can handle it.

574
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,278
Yeah. Rumor goin' around
you almost stared a riot.

575
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:18,240
It was all bullshit, man.

576
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,920
I had to let the peeps in here
know who's the boss.

577
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,038
Just keep
your goddamn nose clean.

578
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:24,920
You already got
enough problems.

579
00:29:26,038 --> 00:29:28,078
And since they stripped
you of your title...

580
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:30,038
they're having this
elimination tournament...

581
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:31,440
to figure out a new champ.

582
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,240
Everybody thinks
Briscoe's a lock to win it.

583
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,078
Word is, Montel's fighting
Jimmy Stubbs in July.

584
00:29:38,078 --> 00:29:39,880
Jimmy Stubbs's a bum.

585
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,598
The good news is
you get outta here...

586
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:45,000
fight the new champ,
we're looking at...

587
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,759
the biggest payday
of boxing history.

588
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,880
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

589
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,838
The one thing I can tell you,
you lost a lot of fan base...

590
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:53,960
with this conviction thing.

591
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,798
Fuck the fans.

592
00:29:55,798 --> 00:29:58,400
I get outta here,
I'll get them back.

593
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,278
The fans pay your bills,
and don't you ever forget it.

594
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:04,528
Yeah.

595
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,880
You gotta keep the pressure
on these lawyers, OK...

596
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
and get you outta here
to fight this...

597
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,920
big money fight with Briscoe.

598
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,078
Yeah.

599
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,558
You can't be servin'
no full sentence.

600
00:30:14,558 --> 00:30:16,720
You're 35 years old.
Time is tickin'.

601
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
Everything
you ever worked for...

602
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,598
it's going
right out the window.

603
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,160
Janiro's an agile boxer,,,

604
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,680
who has the ability
of a champion,

605
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,240
Janiro is fresh off
a victor,,,

606
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,160
over Charlie Consario,

607
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,680
The Rock turns it on,

608
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,118
It's Le Graziano alone,

609
00:30:33,118 --> 00:30:34,960
He won't give Janiro
punching room,

610
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,200
Stays after his man,

611
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,798
Hits him from all angles,

612
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:40,278
He remembers things
from a long time ago,,,

613
00:30:40,278 --> 00:30:41,720
clear as a bell,,,

614
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,118
but ever day,
I gotta tell him who I am.

615
00:30:44,118 --> 00:30:48,358
He's in another world:
Cuba, forty years ago...

616
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:50,759
or some fight he saw in 1953.

617
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,278
Then all of a sudden...

618
00:30:52,278 --> 00:30:55,358
he's right there with you,
like everything's normal.

619
00:30:55,358 --> 00:30:57,759
And mean--
he can be mean as shit.

620
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:00,000
Look, we went to the Emme.

621
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,798
We paid good money
for his protection...

622
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:03,200
and his personal needs.

623
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,000
They gave you the job.

624
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,759
I got him
an oversized cell--

625
00:31:06,759 --> 00:31:09,759
ground level, so he don't
have to use the stairs.

626
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:13,318
Food privileges.
Relaxed dress code.

627
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:14,759
Big easy chair.

628
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:16,838
I even got him his own
little boxing library.

629
00:31:16,838 --> 00:31:19,960
And he's safe. I promise.

630
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,598
These guys I got, they don't
let any harm come his way.

631
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:25,480
# It's hard in the yard #

632
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,278
# You can't be sleepin'
or caught off guard #

633
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:29,038
# When the boys get to creepin'
with sharp objects #

634
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:31,358
# I'm obsessed with putin'
heads in a permanent rest #

635
00:31:31,358 --> 00:31:33,160
# When I flex
thirty-four-inch biceps #

636
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,798
# Getin' swell,
might put your lights out #

637
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:35,960
# Spend the night
in the hole, in here #

638
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,358
# Ever hear is cold #

639
00:31:37,358 --> 00:31:38,440
# It's the gatherin'
of lost souls #

640
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,000
# No self-control #

641
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,598
# Connected with the gangsters
runnin' this shit #

642
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,160
# From the inside,
so there's nowhere to hide #

643
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,640
# Tell your mama that
you'll never come home #

644
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,838
Hey, chief.

645
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,078
Mmm.

646
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,838
How you getting along
with your new cellmate?

647
00:31:53,838 --> 00:31:57,038
-He's OK.
-Mmm.

648
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,278
Rumor has it he took down
one of the skinheads.

649
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,920
A lot of rumors in prison,
you know?

650
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,720
Ah, probably deserved it anyway.

651
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,278
Maybe.

652
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:21,558
We hear you don't want to
associate with anybody here.

653
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:24,838
Maybe you got
way too much attitude, man.

654
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,720
Unh.

655
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,558
Aaron's an expert.
He's the man on appeals.

656
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:41,558
But before we talk
about your appeal...

657
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:44,358
I need to tell you about
Miss Tawnee Rawlins.

658
00:32:44,358 --> 00:32:47,640
She's filed a civil lawsuit
in the amount of $75 million.

659
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,680
You handlin' that?

660
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,318
I'd recommend
an outside attorney.

661
00:32:53,318 --> 00:32:54,480
Another specialist.

662
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,278
However, we can handle
your tax litigation.

663
00:32:57,278 --> 00:32:59,558
The government has filed
an intent to audit.

664
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:01,480
We have someone in the firm
that can deal with that.

665
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,598
ls any of this covered...

666
00:33:02,598 --> 00:33:04,880
by the $2 million
I already paid you?

667
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,000
We get the same deal as you get.

668
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,318
You get paid win or lose.
So do we.

669
00:33:10,318 --> 00:33:12,598
There are a couple
of procedural areas...

670
00:33:12,598 --> 00:33:15,640
that are still in question--
possible reversible error.

671
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,920
But I'm not gonna kid you.
I'd make us a long shot.

672
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,960
You're looking at
a six- to eight-year sentence...

673
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,400
with possible time off
for good behavior.

674
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,160
Now, in California,
that means...

675
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,240
you're eligible for parole
in four years.

676
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,400
What you need to focus on...

677
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,200
is if you become
a model prisoner...

678
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,240
exhibit
special circumstances...

679
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,160
you could be considered
for a work furlough...

680
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,000
as soon as eighteen months
to two years.

681
00:33:39,078 --> 00:33:41,200
So it don't matter
whether I did it or not?

682
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,358
It doesn't work that way.

683
00:33:42,358 --> 00:33:44,038
Justice and the law
are separate issues.

684
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:46,640
Let's get back to
some of your other problems.

685
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,838
We've done an audit.

686
00:33:47,838 --> 00:33:50,200
Your financial situation
is a mess.

687
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,000
-No, that's bullshit.
-No bullshit.

688
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:55,720
Big financial settlements
with your ex-wives, entourage.

689
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,440
Bad investments
and misrepresentations...

690
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,880
by your ex-business manager.

691
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm gonna sue that motherfucker.

692
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,000
And what about this IRS shit?
Where do I stand on that?

693
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,358
By the firm's calculations,
you could end up owing them...

694
00:34:07,358 --> 00:34:10,599
$7 million in back taxes,
and that's just the feds.

695
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:13,199
Then there's the state.
The bottom line--

696
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,400
we need to get
your black ass outta here...

697
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,759
and back in the ring.

698
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,599
Clive Johnson
here ringside,,,

699
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:38,599
for KHIL Channel 13
in the Bay Area,

700
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,159
Next, round seven
of the California,,,

701
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,880
state heavyweight
championship fight,,,

702
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,518
here from the Palmer Arena
in downtown Oakland,

703
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,079
Challenger Monroe Hutchen's
undefeated,,,

704
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:50,840
takin' on
state champ Butch Davis,,,

705
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,920
in what, so far,
has been a nearly even fight,

706
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,599
There's the bell!

707
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,480
Davis has a bad cut
above his left eye,,,

708
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,679
and Monroe Hutchen
looks like,,,

709
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,679
he wants to do
something about it,

710
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,518
It's all Monroe,
it's all Monroe!

711
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:06,920
A big right hand,
Another right!

712
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,159
Davis is down,
and this fight is over!

713
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,079
After forty-three seconds
in the seventh round,,,

714
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,800
Monroe Hutchen is the new,,,

715
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,880
California state
heavyweight champion!

716
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,480
Your attorneys have
come to me and asked me,,,

717
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,679
to handle your response
to the plaintiff's filing,

718
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:30,000
As you know, you are now facing
a separate civil suit...

719
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,400
that may well go to trial...

720
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,079
over the criminal charges
you've been convicted of.

721
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,360
Briefly, "That on March 17,
you and four other men...

722
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,920
"took six women
via private jet...

723
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,440
"from Las Vegas
to Los Angeles--"

724
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,599
Showgirls.

725
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,119
"At approximately 11:30 p.m....

726
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:45,639
"you checked into
the penthouse suite...

727
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:47,079
"of the Beverly Manor hotel."

728
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,760
Until that point of the evening,
all parties concede...

729
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,679
but for minor discrepancies,
the foregoing is true.

730
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,360
What happened next
is in question.

731
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,480
No question.
I ain't no punk-ass rapist.

732
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,280
She wanted it.

733
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,920
Look. None of this makes
any difference at this point.

734
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,440
We're just trying
to get an over--

735
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,559
No. She didn't say no.
She ain't say shit.

736
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:05,679
She didn't have a problem
with any of it.

737
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:08,199
Miss Rawlins
effectively convinced...

738
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,760
the criminal trial jury
that she believed that...

739
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,880
you could break her
in two with one arm.

740
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,320
Yeah, uh-huh.

741
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,440
That's why she was makin'
all them happy sounds...

742
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:19,320
Because I was killin' her,
right?

743
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,280
Some women like it rough.

744
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,800
You know anything about that?

745
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,320
That wasn't part
of your testimony.

746
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:31,199
A lawyer said don't sound
like I'm calling her a ho.

747
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,518
The prosecution
pegged you as a bully.

748
00:36:33,518 --> 00:36:36,840
And she could explain it away
easily enough by saying...

749
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,199
that you mistook what were
in fact her cries for help...

750
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:41,518
for she was just in pain.

751
00:36:41,518 --> 00:36:45,119
I heard pain before,
and--ha ha ha--

752
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,920
believe me,
she wasn't in no pain.

753
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,239
She's asking $75 million...

754
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,840
but I don't like negotiating
with your appeal pending.

755
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,280
No negotiatin'.
I ain't givin' that bitch shit.

756
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,440
And then when he finished,
he just put back on his pants...

757
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,639
and went back out
into the party...

758
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:09,159
and left me alone.

759
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,480
# Ohh #

760
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,719
# Man up #

761
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,518
# Man up #

762
00:37:20,518 --> 00:37:21,679
# Motherfucker,
you are now in jail #

763
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,280
# Man up #

764
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,360
# Motherfucker, where
it's strange as hell #

765
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:27,518
# Because you's
a no-booty and so,,, #

766
00:37:27,518 --> 00:37:28,960
# Man up #

767
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,239
# Motherfucker, get your
manhood took #

768
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:31,400
# Man up #

769
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,920
Champ,,,

770
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm looking to be
your friend, Champ,

771
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,119
I'm a gift.

772
00:37:38,119 --> 00:37:40,518
Well, I don't need no gifts.

773
00:37:40,518 --> 00:37:42,480
Who sent you?

774
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,920
Saladin.
He want to be your friend.

775
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,039
He kind of run things
for El Faziz Assassins.

776
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,159
You can check it out.

777
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,280
You kind of pretty for a bitch.

778
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,518
But I don't want to owe nobody.

779
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:59,599
You tell him I said that.
Now get outta here.

780
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,159
You may be the champ,
but you are only one guy.

781
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:03,920
Let me help you out.

782
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,239
El Faziz Assassins give you
something, you take it.

783
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:10,239
You do not refuse.

784
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:25,719
I'm looking for Saladin.

785
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:32,239
Pleased to meet a man of
your great accomplishments.

786
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:34,000
You run shit here?

787
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,679
There's strength in unity,
brother.

788
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,199
In here we need cooperation
and understanding.

789
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,559
We are at times
discriminated against...

790
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:47,119
even within these walls.

791
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,880
Now, if you wish to come
and join with us--

792
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,039
Oh!

793
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,000
Brother,
if you don't join with us...

794
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,679
you'll be destroying
the unity we create.

795
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:43,039
Warden wants to see you.

796
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,719
That's quite a show
you put on there.

797
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,880
Come on. Let's go.

798
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,199
I'm disappointed.

799
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,880
Three incidents already,
one a near riot...

800
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,960
one an assault and now
a physical confrontation...

801
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,880
that has sent five men
to the hospital...

802
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,440
for medical treatment.

803
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:04,559
You've only been here ten weeks.
It is undeniable--

804
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:07,159
you are making
a very poor record.

805
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,480
The whole thing is,
they got to respect you...

806
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,559
or you nothin'.

807
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:12,800
I believe that
you're missing the point.

808
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,320
The warden is trying
to explain the idea...

809
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,719
of acceptable behavior.

810
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,000
I'm trying to explain to him
how to survive.

811
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,920
I don't think there
are too many inmates here...

812
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,800
who could challenge you
physically, Mr. Chambers.

813
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,679
You really don't understand.

814
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,079
When you're the champ,
everybody wants a piece of you.

815
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,320
Everybody’s testing you.

816
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:40,559
My whole life, I got a problem,
I take care of it with these.

817
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,280
People love a guy who can fight.

818
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,760
Money, pussy, kiss your ass,
put you on TV...

819
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,840
put your picture
in papers, magazines...

820
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:53,518
anything I want, because people
love a guy who can fight...

821
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,360
and don't take shit.

822
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,079
# Murder #

823
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,039
# The choice I made,
so now I pay #

824
00:41:28,039 --> 00:41:29,518
# Thinkin' back,
I have to ask #

825
00:41:29,518 --> 00:41:30,960
# How'd it end this way? #

826
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,800
# You see,
it all happened so fast #

827
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,119
# I couldn't think twice #

828
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,599
# Now I'm chillin'
for killin' #

829
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,360
# And I'm payin' the price #

830
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,518
Who I'm with is none
of your business!

831
00:41:43,518 --> 00:41:45,199
None of my business?
I'll deal with you--

832
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:47,440
Stop it!
You're killing him!

833
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,480
On the night
of December 1, 1990...

834
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,320
you beat a man to death
with your bare fists...

835
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,199
which because
of your profession,,,

836
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,639
and your training
are considered,,,

837
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:04,599
to be lethal weapons
in the state of California,

838
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,920
You've been found guilty
by a jury of your peers,,,

839
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,639
and you are sentenced
to life imprisonment,,,

840
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,280
without the possibility
of parole,

841
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:21,039
Good morning, Mr. Ripstein.
How are you today?

842
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,599
Don't give me no shit.

843
00:42:22,599 --> 00:42:24,119
How the hell
is the fight comin'?

844
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:25,599
What fight?

845
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,518
We got the heavyweight
champion of the world...

846
00:42:28,518 --> 00:42:31,039
and an unbeaten prospect
right here in Sweetwater.

847
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,960
Quit wasting time.
Set the fuckin' thing up.

848
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,280
I know fights.

849
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,719
Long prize,
Monroe kicks his ass...

850
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,679
we can make
a lot of money here.

851
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:45,840
Mr. Ripstein, excuse me,
but you're talking about...

852
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,719
the real heavyweight
champion of the world.

853
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,639
Are you gonna fix the fight?

854
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,159
Shit no. Boxing.

855
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:55,360
It's a matter of style.
They all can be beaten.

856
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,880
Right time, right place,
the right circumstance...

857
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,840
they all can be beaten.

858
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,920
Mr. Ripstein wants
to see the Iceman...

859
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,840
fight a prisoner
we got in here.

860
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,760
His name is Monroe Hutchen.

861
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,159
And a real goddamn fight. Pure.

862
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:15,840
So, what do you want us to do?

863
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,880
I talked to the head guard.
He's OK.

864
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,320
But the warden's a problem.

865
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,440
Mr. Ripstein said
you can take care of him.

866
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,518
You know the drill.

867
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:29,039
You help him or you hurt him.

868
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:32,880
Now...about Monroe Hutchen.

869
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:35,679
The warden thinks it's time...

870
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,599
to give him a chance
to rehabilitate himself...

871
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,119
by socializing
with the other prisoners.

872
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,400
In six weeks,
I'm going on vacation.

873
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,880
On the fifth,
I'll be gone for two weeks.

874
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,400
First week in New Orleans...

875
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,360
second week visiting friends
in Tucson, Arizona.

876
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,679
If while I am gone...

877
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:52,400
if Mr. Hutchen happens to
get into a sparring match...

878
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,880
with Mr. Chambers,
I don't want to hear about it.

879
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,239
And when I get back...

880
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:59,280
I want this whole goddamned
enterprise finished.

881
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,440
Yes, sir.

882
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:02,159
Leaving no evidence,
no videotape...

883
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:04,599
and never to be spoken of
in my presence.

884
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,159
-Anything else, sir?
-Hit the yard.

885
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:07,400
Thank you.

886
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,920
Had to have been somebody
in the governor's office.

887
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,039
Soon as he got the call...

888
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:14,800
Mr. Backbone started
arranging his vacation.

889
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,920
Know what that means,
don't you?

890
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,039
This whole load of shit
comes down on you and me.

891
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,679
There is no "you and me."

892
00:44:19,679 --> 00:44:21,679
I'm taking my vacation
right along with the warden.

893
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,559
Well, thank you
for your support.

894
00:44:23,559 --> 00:44:26,480
Oh, come on.
You run the fight program here.

895
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,400
You want this to happen.

896
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,599
Here we go, Monroe.

897
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,119
Free at last, free at last.

898
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:51,079
-I'm not going to Folsom.
-What can I tell you?

899
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:54,280
Looks like the warden
went and changed his mind.

900
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,199
You get to stay home with us.

901
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,400
Yeah, Operator,
a collect call to Yank Lewis.

902
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,280
No. Yank Lewis.

903
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,440
From George Chambers,
the Iceman.

904
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:15,960
Yank. Yeah, man, it's me.

905
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,199
Who the hell you think it is?

906
00:45:18,199 --> 00:45:21,280
Get your ass up here
and share the beauty.

907
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,920
Maybe I got to a ticket
back on the gravy train,

908
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,760
What?
What are you talking about?

909
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,000
Remember your old buddy
from Miami, Mendy Ripstein?

910
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,400
Yeah,

911
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,320
His boy came up to me
and said...

912
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,239
that if I fight
some punk in here...

913
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:35,159
he could maybe
get me out quick.

914
00:45:35,159 --> 00:45:39,960
If Mendy Ripstein says it,
then it's the real deal.

915
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,280
But you can't hear this
from some other guy.

916
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,639
You gotta hear this
from Mendy himself.

917
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:46,119
Then it's dope for sure.

918
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:48,920
If it's on the real,
I'll whip on this punk's ass...

919
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,518
and be out of here.

920
00:45:50,518 --> 00:45:53,679
Who's the punk?
Don't tell me Monroe Hutchen.

921
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,239
He fought out of Oakland.
He was undefeated.

922
00:45:57,239 --> 00:46:00,840
He was a real prospect, man.
He's a full load.

923
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,840
Even if he was something,
he's been in here for ten years.

924
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:07,039
I'm just saying it might not be
a walk in the park.

925
00:46:07,039 --> 00:46:09,199
-I don't believe this shit.
-What?

926
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:10,960
You worried about me
being out of shape.

927
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,239
I've been in here
for four months.

928
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:13,800
That chump been in here
for ten years.

929
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,559
-You too much, man.
-What? That's concern--

930
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:18,119
Get the fuck outta here.

931
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,119
Yes, I want you to fight him,

932
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:27,800
In the cage, no gloves,
bare-fisted, to the finish,

933
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:30,599
I make a couple of calls,
I put down some money,,,

934
00:46:30,599 --> 00:46:32,199
There's some people
on the outside,,,

935
00:46:32,199 --> 00:46:34,960
that know you,
everybody knows him,,,

936
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,559
we'll get maybe twenty,
thirty-to-one odds,

937
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:40,599
It's easy to spread around,
maybe two hundred thousand,

938
00:46:40,599 --> 00:46:45,320
You win, that's
four million bucks, maybe more.

939
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,000
And I think he can't wait.

940
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,599
What's in it for me?

941
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:57,079
Mr. Ripstein
uses his influence...

942
00:46:57,079 --> 00:46:59,039

Offer me half the profit,

946
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,159
Oh, I don't think so.

947
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,639
I'm putting up all the dough
on a real long shot.

I'm taking all the risk.

buy in here?

What the money matter to you?

954
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,199
You're gonna get ten percent.

955
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:28,320
I know that fighters
usually get...

956

fifty percent, minimum,
on the outside.

957
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:34,320
Yeah, but we're not outside.

959

she got three kids...

no job, no skills, no husband.

961
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:45,880
Government gives her
a check once a month.

962
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,800
I could send her the money.

963
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,639
You're gonna get thirty percent
of everything we win.

It's a deal?

Forty percent.

Mr. Ripstein thanks you
for bringing him...

to this neutral location.

970

The Iceman doesn't want
any disappointments.

971
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,559
He expects to negotiate.

972

You have to understand...

973
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:33,800
that Mr. Ripstein is
a great boxing enthusiast...

974

a great student of the art...

Queensbury changed the rules
to the ones that we got now.

What about a foul?
Who's gonna ref this thing?

1010
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,960
There isn't any referee.
That's one of the rules.

What kind of shit is this, huh?

Mr. Mercker can judge fouls
from outside the cage.

No kicking, butting, low blows.

1014

If you win or lose on a foul,
all deals are off.

I wanted to talk to you

00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:21,400
Actually, about the gloves.

1038
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,639
There aren't any gloves.

of the rules.

We've got a situation,
Get down to the mess,

1099
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:01,400
On the double, all right?
Riot's coming down,

1100
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:06,360
Hey, Iceman!

1101
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:10,599
Hey, Iceman.

1102
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,400
Before you came here...

1103
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,920
we all figured
you were some kind of dude.

1104
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:18,280
Then you show up
actin' like you're the God...

1105
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,719
and we're the sod,

1106
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:21,639
Well, hey, man,
every dog in here,,,

1107
00:55:21,639 --> 00:55:23,320
wanted to see you
get your ass kicked,

1108
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,840
You're goin' down, man!

1109
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,079
Shit.

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,639
Kick your ass, motherfucker!

1112
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,599
Let's go! Move!
Move! Move! Move!

1113
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,760
Give them one!
Take out the ceiling!

He cancelled the fight,

1116

Jesus fuckin' Christ,
this fuckin' state.

1117

Who the fuck
does this fuckin' warden...

1118
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,559
fuckin' think he is?

1119

Doesn't anybody know how to do
business in this fuckin' state?

Lay there in the fuckin' sun
and do nothin'.

1126
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,480
Then this fuckin' state
grabs my ass for taxes.

1127
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,480
Why the fuck I didn't stay
in fuckin' Florida...

to do fuckin' business.

00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,090
Shit,

1131
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:12,119
Somethin' needs
to get fuckin' done...

1132
00:57:12,119 --> 00:57:14,039
I gotta do it myself.

1133
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:20,920
Call the fuckin' warden.
I wanna meet him.

1134
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,199
Yes, sir, Mr. Ripstein.

1135
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:40,559
I don't make it a habit
of meeting with prisoners.

1136
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,639
I'm doing this out of deference
to Mr. Mercker here...

1137
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:44,559
who thought
it'd be a good idea.

1138
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:47,920
However, any attempt to have me
reinstate the fight...

1139
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:50,599
between Mr. Chambers and
Monroe Hutchen will be futile.

1140
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:53,320
It has been
irrevocably cancelled.

1141
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:57,079
Can I tell you a story?
One of my favorites.

1142
00:57:57,079 --> 00:57:59,039
It's about how things get done.

1143
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:01,960
This is a story that
takes place in about--

1144
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:04,280
it must've been
the middle 1950s.

1145
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,239
I was second in charge
of certain operations...

1146
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:11,639
second to a Mr. Meyer Lansky.

1147
00:58:11,639 --> 00:58:15,920
There was this casino--
a new one--

1148
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,679
that had been built
in a neighboring town.

1149
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:24,760
But the mayor, he wanted
to close that casino...

1150
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:28,518
because he did not
like gambling.

1151
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:32,400
He thought it brought
the wrong kind of people.

1152
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,800
So he ordered
the casino closed. Ohh.

1153
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:40,559
I had to report this
to Mr. Lansky.

1154
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,559
So Mr. Lansky,
he told me, he says...

1155
00:58:43,559 --> 00:58:45,480
"You tell that mayor...

1156
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,280
"that the casino stays open,
no question"...

1157
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,079
but that the mayor
had a choice.

1158
00:58:53,079 --> 00:58:59,880
He could choose to be killed,
or he could choose to have...

1159
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:03,960
a great deal of money
deposited in his bank account.

1160
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:07,719
It was his choice.

1161
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:12,920
In either case,
the casino stays open.

1162
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:16,119
What happened to the mayor?

1163
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,360
He died,

1164
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:23,440
He hit his ignition and his car
exploded like a fireball.

1165
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:27,599
You're gonna stand there and
let this hoodlum threaten me?

1166
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:32,599
Well, sir, I don't much
want my car to blow up.

1167
00:59:32,599 --> 00:59:34,559
We could
talk about the money...

1168

when you come back
from your vacation.

1169
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:40,000
I understand
you're leaving tomorrow?

1170

you and your family...

1171

01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,119
Time!

1173

We're gonna limo over
a few guys from Vegas--

1174
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:13,599

01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,518
Chuy, we've been talkin'.

1176
01:00:16,518 --> 01:00:18,599
We need you
to go to the Iceman.

1177
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:19,800
Get a number.

1178
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,880
We're gettin' a hell
of a price on Monroe.

1179
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:24,039
We need the Iceman
to go for it.

1180
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:27,239
Ask him to lie down?
I don't see it.

1181
01:00:27,239 --> 01:00:28,719
Offer him a million.

1182
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:31,280
He made $25 million the last
time he fought somebody.

1183
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,840
-He had to fight for that one.
-Talk to him.

1185
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:37,119
You hired me
to look after Mendy.

1186
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:38,960
I'm looking after him
right now.

1187
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:40,840
Mendy wants a straight fight.
It's not the money.

1188

Bullshit! In New York,
in Cuba, in Florida...

it's always about the money.

1190
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:48,599
He's got it stashed
all over the place.

He's got every fucking
nickel he ever made.

1193
01:00:52,518 --> 01:00:54,760
With Mendy,
it's always about the money.

1194
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,880
You guys are way off
Mendy's radar on this deal...

1195
01:00:56,880 --> 01:00:58,518
and I don't want
to mess it up for him.

1196
01:00:58,518 --> 01:01:01,280
Mendy wants a straight fight
to the finish, and that's it.

1197
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:04,000
You want the Iceman to dump?
You go talk to him.

1198
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,000
But don't get your hopes up.

1199
01:01:10,159 --> 01:01:13,280
OK, Monroe, now that
this thing is back on...

1200
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:16,079
here's the deal.
We got a guy in the dispensary.

1201
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:19,719
He's gonna steal five or ten
Valiums, crush them up.

1202
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:22,480
And I got another guy
in the commissary.

1203
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:25,840
Last meal Iceman eats before
he fights, we mix it in.

1204
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:29,599
Just enough to slow him down,
fuck him up.

1205
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:33,559
Now, he'll still fight,
but he won't be the same.

1206
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:35,760
That'll be just enough
to give you the edge.

1207
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,199
You got it?

1208
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:42,239
You do that, I'm gonna
break you up into pieces.

1209
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:46,920
I can take this guy,
and I don't need no help.

1210
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:49,079
You understand that?

1211
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,039
Hey! We're just trying
to give you...

1212

a little something extra, man.

1213

We got a lot of money
on this table.

1214

I may not be a real good guy...

1215

but I ain't no chickenshit,
either. You remember that.

1216

Yeah, let it go! Let it go!

1251
01:05:30,800 --> 01:05:34,440
# O'er the land
of the free,,, #

1252
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:37,280
He don't look good.
He's ugly.

1253
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:43,199
# And the home of the brave #

1254
01:05:53,159 --> 01:05:55,960
It's time! It's time!

1255
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:58,440
Fighters to the ring!
Fighters to the ring!

1256
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:02,000
Fight's on! Fight's on!

1257
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,719
# Now the time has come #

1258
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:16,960
# Time #

1259
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,480
# No place to run #

1260
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:22,639
# Might get burned up
by the sun #

1261
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:23,760
# Time #

1262
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,280
# But I'll have my fun #

1263
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,199
Good evening, honored guests,
scumbags, and Mr. Mercker...

1264
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:32,518
the time is now!

1265
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:36,400
We got a first here,
my friends...

1266
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,679
courtesy of a great man,
whose name I cannot say.

1267
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:42,039
Fight fans all over the world
are gonna be wishin',,,

1268
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,920
they's in the bottom
of the barrel with us,,,

1269
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,719
wishin' Sweetwater Prison
was their home tonight!

1270
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,559
Now pay close attention...

1271
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:53,518
Because I'm only
gonna say this once.

1272
01:06:53,518 --> 01:06:55,599
The fight you're about to see
follows a set of rules...

1273
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:57,480
never been used before
around here.

1274
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,719
London Prize Rules:

1275
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:00,679
no traditional rounds
to speak of...

1276
01:07:00,679 --> 01:07:02,280
no regulation-size gloves...

1277
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,400
just those bitty six-ounce
suckers gonna tear up.

1278
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,320
A fighter steps from
the mark ready to fight.

1279
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:10,000
He go down, then he got
sixty seconds to come back.

1280
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:12,800
That's it!
Fight to the finish! No ref!

1281
01:07:12,800 --> 01:07:15,000
All we got is the timekeeper
for the mark!

1282
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,559
Our very own Mr. Mercker,
the walkin' boss.

1283
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,079
Now put your hands together,
my friends...

1284
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,920
for our favorite son...

1285
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,239
Sweetwater's
defending champion...

1286
01:07:25,239 --> 01:07:27,119
undefeated,
with a prison record...

1287
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,960
of 68 wins, no losses,
weighing in at 199 pounds...

1288
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:34,119
wearing the burgundy trunks
with the black trim...

1289
01:07:34,119 --> 01:07:37,079
Monroe...Monroe...

1290
01:07:37,079 --> 01:07:40,000
Monroe Hutchen!

1291
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:42,440
Monroe Hutchen!
Monroe Hutchen!

1292
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:45,599
Now give it up
for the west corner.

1293
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:48,719
He's also undefeated...
on the outside.

1294
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:50,239
Weighing in at 205,,,

1295
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:53,360
the former heavyweight
champion of the world,,,

1296
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:56,239
George "Iceman" Chambers!

1297
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,440
Come on, motherfucker!

1298
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,960
There's only
one thing I got to say--

1299
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,639
put his ass
between his shoulders!

1300
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:04,079
OK, brother cons,
we are ready!

1301
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,239
Now, don't let your passion
for the great Monroe...

1302
01:08:06,239 --> 01:08:09,679
interfere with good judgment,
and don't do nothin' stupid!

1303
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:11,119
That'll forfeit
all the money...

1304
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:12,719
that you guys bet
at those big odds.

1305
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:15,319
And welcome to our amigos
from Las Vegas...

1306
01:08:15,319 --> 01:08:17,440
here to witness this contest
and report it,,,

1307
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:19,440
to various cities
all around our great country,

1308
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:21,119
Whole lotta bookmakers
out there want to know...

1309
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:22,440
what's comin' down.

1310
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,679
Well, it's us against
the world, my brothers,

1311
01:08:24,679 --> 01:08:27,920
And just like you, I too am
for the great Monroe Hutchen!

1312
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:29,960
He brought honor
to our house of pain...

1313
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,679
but I will call
a neutral fight.

1314
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:33,479
Come on, bitch.

1315
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,199
This is the fight
for what's right,

1316
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,679
This is the brawl for it all!

1317
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:37,840
This fight ain't about money!

1318
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,479
This is their
heavyweight champion,,,

1319
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:41,078
against our
heavyweight champion!

1320
01:08:41,078 --> 01:08:44,920
This fight is for respeck!
R-e-s-p-e-c-k!

1321
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:46,078
Respeck!

1322
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,359
Round one! Round one!

1323
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:54,319
And here we go, baby.

1324
01:08:56,038 --> 01:08:58,000
They move
to the center of the ring,,,

1325
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,720
feelin' each other out,

1326
01:09:04,439 --> 01:09:06,198
You gotta remember something:

1327
01:09:06,198 --> 01:09:08,118
Monroe is
a forty-to-one underdog,,,

1328
01:09:08,118 --> 01:09:10,399
goin' up against the Iceman,
a great champion,

1329
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:16,158
Combinations, man!
Combinations!

1330
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:18,279
Monroe swings and misses,
Iceman counters,,,

1331
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,600
with a hard right hand
to the head!

1332
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:22,600
-That's it, baby, come on!
-Hit that big motherfucker!

1333
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:26,198
Monroe's
backpedaling, circling,

1334
01:09:26,198 --> 01:09:27,520
Doesn't look
like he's too willing,,,

1335
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,118
to trade punches
with the Iceman,

1336
01:09:31,118 --> 01:09:33,600
Watch it, Monroe,
watch it, now, baby!

1337
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:39,238
Lookin' for a way
to get to Monroe,

1338
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:41,439
Now he's tauntin' him!
He's tauntin' Monroe!

1339
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:43,439
He's taunting him!
Monroe swings,

1340
01:09:43,439 --> 01:09:45,158
The Iceman hits him
with a hard right,,,

1341
01:09:45,158 --> 01:09:46,439
and a left to Monroe's head!

1342
01:09:46,439 --> 01:09:48,359
You ain't hurt him!
You ain't hurt him!

1343
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:50,000
Hey, bullshit!

1344
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:52,720
Oh, Monroe misses,,,

1345
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,399
and the Iceman tags him
with a hard left hand,,,

1346
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:56,279
and Monroe
is going backwards, baby,

1347
01:09:56,279 --> 01:09:58,238
The Iceman tauntin' him on,

1348
01:10:01,078 --> 01:10:02,479
Get in his face!
Get in his face!

1349
01:10:05,720 --> 01:10:08,800
Monroe lands an overhand right!
Now a combination!

1350
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,960
Monroe's getting himself
into this fight!

1351
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,960
The Iceman counters with
a hard right to the face,

1352
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:15,198
Another right to the head,

1353
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:19,238
Monroe is fast, but the Iceman
is much stronger,

1354
01:10:19,238 --> 01:10:22,520
They hook up again! Both men
exchanging combinations!

1355
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:25,640
Right hand!
Left! Right! Right!

1356
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:29,399
And boom!
The Iceman drives Monroe back!

1357
01:10:32,399 --> 01:10:34,800
Make him bleed, man,
make him bleed!

1358
01:10:38,038 --> 01:10:40,078
Both men throw combinations!

1359
01:10:40,078 --> 01:10:42,680
Left! Right! Overhand right!

1360
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:46,640
Monroe misses,
The Iceman comes back,,,

1361
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,399
with a right-left to the head!

1362
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:50,279
Get him!

1363
01:10:50,279 --> 01:10:52,520
They're fighting
at an incredible pace!

1364
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,960
Can you believe it?

1365
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,880
Nice overhand right
by Monroe!

1366
01:10:57,880 --> 01:11:01,399
Iceman's not hurt, but he
ties Monroe up in a clinch!

1367
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:05,640
Oh, shit, baby! Go get him!

1368
01:11:08,118 --> 01:11:09,439
Hard right hand!

1369
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,118
Yeah! Another one! Move!

1370
01:11:11,118 --> 01:11:12,680
Monroe swings and misses,,,

1371
01:11:12,680 --> 01:11:14,439
and the Iceman
keeps hurting' him,,,

1372
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:16,560
with an overhand right,

1373
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,760
Combination, right-left!

1374
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,560
Big left hook!

1375
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:23,078
A right and a left
to the stomach,

1376
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:25,038
Another left--
oh, an uppercut!

1377
01:11:25,038 --> 01:11:26,640
And Monroe is down!

1378
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:28,078
Sixty seconds!

1379
01:11:28,078 --> 01:11:30,920
And we now know why
he's the heavyweight champion...

1380
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,560
of the world.

1381
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:35,279
Huh? Huh? Huh?

1382
01:11:35,279 --> 01:11:37,319
Huh? What? What?

1383
01:11:37,319 --> 01:11:39,158
And Monroe is up!

1384
01:11:39,158 --> 01:11:41,399
Looks like he will continue,

1385
01:11:43,439 --> 01:11:44,840
Hey, Iceman, you ain't shit!

1386
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,760
You just got robbed!

1387
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,680
The Iceman's straight-ahead,
locomotive style,,,

1388
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,439
may be a little too much
for Monroe,

1389
01:11:50,439 --> 01:11:52,840
He's never had to face
anything like this,

1390
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,720
-Boo!
-Fuck!

1391
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:57,439
-Boo!
-Come on, big daddy!

1392
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,158
The Iceman's in his corner,,,

1393
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:00,479
a mighty confident man,

1394
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,640
That's what you gotta do!
Let's go!

1395
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,960
Monroe's trademark of
occasionally switching,,,

1396
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,640
to a southpaw
left-hand style--

1397
01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:08,198
ain't workin' so far, baby!

1398
01:12:08,198 --> 01:12:09,880
Ten seconds!
Fighters to the line!

1399
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:12,198
Fighters to the line!
Clear the ring!

1400
01:12:13,439 --> 01:12:14,920
Pucker up, motherfucker.

1401
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,118
Clear the ring!

1402
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:20,118
Round Two!

1403
01:12:21,158 --> 01:12:22,640
And here we go, baby!

1404
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,359
Despite the knockdown,
Monroe looks,,,

1405
01:12:24,359 --> 01:12:27,078
like he's pulled himself
back together,

1406
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,279
The Iceman misses,,,

1407
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:37,439
and Monroe lands
an overhand right!

1408
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,720
Right hand! Right hand!

1409
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:44,880
A quick-hit exchange!

1410
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,118
Now this is boxing!
Hard combinations,,,

1411
01:12:47,118 --> 01:12:49,800
and they clinch!
Beautiful! Beautiful!

1412
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:56,118
Ooh, what a right hand
by the Iceman!

1413
01:12:56,118 --> 01:12:58,680
Another right to the head,
Monroe misses,,,

1414
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:00,560
and pays for it dearly
to the body,,,

1415
01:13:00,560 --> 01:13:02,000
and he reels back
from the punishment,,,

1416
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,439
given to him by the Iceman,

1417
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:05,960
Another hard right and left,
and Monroe is on his heels!

1418
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:07,238
He's up against the fence!

1419
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:08,880
The Iceman
is going for the body!

1420
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:10,680
Another one to the body,
and it doesn't look good,,,

1421
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,520
for Sweetwater’s
own favorite son,

1422
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,800
The Iceman's all over him!
He's tearin' Monroe up!

1423
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,680
Oh, another right
to the head!

1424
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,038
Monroe's down, and he's dizzy
as a motherfucker!

1425
01:13:21,038 --> 01:13:24,038
He's talkin' shit, baby!
He's talkin' shit!

1426
01:13:24,038 --> 01:13:25,840
Who the hell you think--
I know he ain't talkin' to me,

1427
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:26,960
He's talkin' to y'all!

1428
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:29,520
That's right! Yeah! Uh-huh!

1429
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,118
Monroe's wobbly, He's shaky,

1430
01:13:32,118 --> 01:13:34,800
There's no question about it,
Monroe is hurt!

1431
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,238
Come on! Come on!

1432
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:39,520
Don't get careless.
Knock him on his ass!

1433
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:41,720
Now take a whiff of this.
Come on.

1434
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,479
This fight is far from over.

1435
01:13:43,479 --> 01:13:45,319
You're gonna get him.
We got plenty of time.

1436
01:13:45,319 --> 01:13:47,920
He just loves
to taunt the crowd,

1437
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:49,960
He's got everything
going his way,

1438
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,560
Oh, that Iceman is
one cocky son of a bitch,

1439
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:55,238
He's already knocked
him down twice, Eddie!

1440
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:57,118
I don't know how much longer
this has got to go.

1441
01:13:57,118 --> 01:13:58,560
You gotta fight your fight!

1442
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,840
You're fightin' his fight.
You control the rhythm.

1443
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:03,158
You gotta
turn this fight around!

1444
01:14:03,158 --> 01:14:05,078
You can do it, Monroe!
Come on, now!

1445
01:14:05,078 --> 01:14:06,399
This is your round!

1446
01:14:06,399 --> 01:14:08,600
The Iceman lookin'
supremely confident,

1447
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,238
He's got it all going his way!

1448
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:12,720
Round three!

1449
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:17,520
They come out,
and it seems like the Iceman,,,

1450
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,439
is just trying
to find that one big shot,,,

1451
01:14:19,439 --> 01:14:21,158
that will put Monroe
on his ass,,,

1452
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:22,800
and give him a one-way
ticket to Bootyville.

1453
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:27,920
Oh! A big right hand
by the Iceman!

1454
01:14:29,399 --> 01:14:31,840
And another right hand
by the Iceman!

1455
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:33,760
This can't go much further!

1456
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,198
That's it! That's it!

1457
01:14:35,198 --> 01:14:37,198
Come on, Mo! Dance with him!

1458
01:14:37,198 --> 01:14:39,800
Both of these men
are great warriors,

1459
01:14:39,800 --> 01:14:42,198
Iceman has a look
of determination in his eye--

1460
01:14:42,198 --> 01:14:44,158
but like I said before,
brother scumbags,,,

1461
01:14:44,158 --> 01:14:47,920
he's lookin' for that big punch
to end it all for Monroe,

1462
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,800
The Iceman is clearly
in control of this fight,

1463
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:54,279
But Monroe
is still there, baby.

1464
01:14:54,279 --> 01:14:56,319
Our favorite son
is still standin',

1465
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:02,198
Oh, that right hand just
keeps shakin' Monroe up!

1466
01:15:02,198 --> 01:15:04,118
Stay strong! Stay strong!

1467
01:15:08,078 --> 01:15:10,319
Big left and right
comin' from the Iceman!

1468
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:12,399
He is all over Monroe!

1469
01:15:12,399 --> 01:15:14,118
And the Iceman is on the hunt!

1470
01:15:14,118 --> 01:15:15,479
He's on the prowl!

1471
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:17,439
He's goin' in for the kill!

1472
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:20,118
Oh, God!

1473
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:24,479
What a devastating
left hook from Monroe!

1474
01:15:24,479 --> 01:15:26,479
The Iceman is staggering,
and he's hurt!

1475
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,439
Oh, Monroe hits him
with another shot!

1476
01:15:31,439 --> 01:15:33,800
He's drivin' him
back up against the cage,,,

1477
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,399
punishing him
with wicked combinations!

1478
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:36,960
Monroe is all over him!

1479
01:15:41,198 --> 01:15:43,560
He's hurt! He's hurt!
Left, and right!

1480
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,840
Oh, shit.

1481
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,800
Can you believe it?!

1482
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:49,319
Ohh! And a right hand
puts the Iceman down!

1483
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:51,078
The Iceman is down,,,

1484
01:15:51,078 --> 01:15:52,680
for the first time
in his career!

1485
01:15:52,680 --> 01:15:53,920
Sixty seconds!

1486
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:55,359
Shit!

1487
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:57,198
This is unbelievable,

1488
01:15:57,198 --> 01:15:58,520
Unbelievable!

1489
01:15:58,520 --> 01:15:59,880
Way to go, Monroe!

1490
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:01,600
I can't believe it!
The Iceman is down!

1491
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:05,359
And the Iceman is up,
He's staggerin' around,

1492
01:16:05,359 --> 01:16:07,560
He doesn't know where he is,

1493
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,359
Oh, my God, he's gone
plum-fuckin'-crazy in there!

1494
01:16:10,359 --> 01:16:12,560
The Iceman's gone
absolutely crazy,

1495
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:14,840
This could be it, This could be
a disqualification,

1496
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:17,238
Somebody get in there
and stop this thing!

1497
01:16:17,238 --> 01:16:19,158
I got a lotta damn money
ridin' on this!

1498
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:26,640
Pandemonium! Out of control!

1499
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,319
Pandemonium! Out of control!

1500
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:29,680
[Crowd chants "Monroe"]

1501
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,238
Monroe has definitely
turned this fight around,

1502
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:37,038
What goes on in the mind
of George "Iceman" Chambers,,,

1503
01:16:37,038 --> 01:16:38,880
at this moment
is anybody's guess,

1504
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,880
This is one
for the record books, baby,

1505
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,198
People are gonna be talking
about this,,,

1506
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:43,479
for the rest of their life,
and if I knew,,,

1507
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:45,198
I had to go to jail
to see a fight like this...

1508
01:16:45,198 --> 01:16:46,880
I'd have did a crime
a long time ago!

1509
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:49,158
This is your night!
This is your house, baby!

1510
01:16:49,158 --> 01:16:51,720
Don't let up! Go at him!
Stick him hard!

1511
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:54,520
Take him out, baby! Come on!

1512
01:16:54,520 --> 01:16:56,560
Ten seconds!
Fighters to the line!

1513
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:59,800
You can do it!
Kick his ass!

1514
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:01,920
Let's go, Monroe, let's go!

1515
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:04,720
That was
the toughest round,,,

1516
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,158
in the Iceman's whole career,

1517
01:17:06,158 --> 01:17:09,038
He must regain momentum,
He must come out strong,

1518
01:17:09,038 --> 01:17:10,960
He must get back
in this fight!

1519
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,880
Oh! And he is back!
A left and a right to Monroe!

1520
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:22,000
Monroe hits him with
a right hand, left hand,,,

1521
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,319
and another right hand,,,

1522
01:17:23,319 --> 01:17:25,319
and the Iceman
is forced to clinch!

1523
01:17:25,319 --> 01:17:27,279
Stick him, baby! Go at him now!

1524
01:17:29,238 --> 01:17:31,720
Monroe switches to southpaw!

1525
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:38,479
They're hookin' up!
Toe to toe!

1526
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:40,399
Punch for punch!
Back and forth!

1527
01:17:40,399 --> 01:17:42,479
This is a war!

1528
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,439
Oh, my god, what a fight!
And I am so happy,,,

1529
01:17:47,439 --> 01:17:50,238
that it's happenin' right here
at Sweetwater Prison,

1530
01:17:50,238 --> 01:17:51,439
Let's go, baby!

1531
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,560
He's on the hunt!
Monroe's on the prowl!

1532
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,840
Right hand!
A left to the stomach!

1533
01:17:56,840 --> 01:17:58,238
Overhand right!

1534
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:00,319
Another left and a right,
and an overhand right,,,

1535
01:18:00,319 --> 01:18:01,760
to the head!

1536
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:05,000
Monroe is punishing him,,,

1537
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,840
with blows to the head
and the body,

1538
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,720
Say what you want to say about
George "Iceman" Chambers,,,

1539
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,680
but he is dead game!

1540
01:18:47,078 --> 01:18:49,238
It's over! It's over!

1541
01:18:49,238 --> 01:18:51,800
Monroe wins again! It's over!

1542
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,000
It's over!

1543
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,118
That's it! Monroe wins,,,

1544
01:18:55,118 --> 01:18:58,479
and I just won
a lot of goddamn money!

1545
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:01,118
Yeah! Yeah!

1546
01:19:01,118 --> 01:19:03,399
You owe me money, Eddie!
You owe me money!

1547
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:06,238
Monroe! Monroe!

1548
01:19:07,640 --> 01:19:09,560
Yeah! Yeah!

1549
01:19:28,279 --> 01:19:30,399
Monroe! Yeah!

1550
01:20:03,118 --> 01:20:07,359
But this...
this is a thing of beauty.

1551
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,238
A great thing of beauty.

1552
01:20:10,238 --> 01:20:12,560
Two guys
fightin' to the finish...

1553
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:16,118
but just one guy wins
because he's the better man...

1554
01:20:16,118 --> 01:20:19,439
and that's what
the goddamn sport is about.

1555
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,279
Mendy Ripstein died
3 weeks after the big fight,

1556
01:20:32,279 --> 01:20:35,038
He kept his word,
Monroe got his money,,,

1557
01:20:35,038 --> 01:20:37,479
and the Iceman got out
on special parole,

1558
01:20:37,479 --> 01:20:39,399
I can personally
