1
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,842
Tbilisi - Georgia, 1992

2
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,482
Georgians have always been warlike.

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,123
Many keep a sword in the house.
Still.

4
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,251
All Georgians should have a weapon.

5
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,721
But not to rob people.

6
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,403
Hello.

7
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,967
I also copied it.
- Someone knocked.

8
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,403
Did you bring it?

9
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,003
What does he write?

10
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,529
Come on, tell.
- Hold on.

11
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,170
Take your leg away.
- Keep on walking.

12
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,766
No, I was talking to my sister.

13
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,530
Are they nice?
- Taste this.

14
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,525
What took you so long?

15
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,604
Are you already in the queue?
- Yes, come quickly.

16
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,327
Hey, don't jump the queue.

17
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,926
Are you talking to me?
- Yes.

18
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,687
You think I'm stupid?

19
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,208
Say something about it, people.
They are jumping the queue.

20
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,364
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to keep order here.

21
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,524
Take it easy, ma'am. No one is jumping the queue.
She was already here.

22
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,729
What do you mean, she was already here?

23
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,281
She stood there and I was here.

24
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,649
I have seen her, but not you.

25
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,211
Make a little space.
I do not care. In line.

26
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,322
Come on with the bread.

27
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,246
No jumping the queue.

28
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,450
Let that woman with that child pass.

29
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,645
What took you?
We're starving.

30
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,802
I'm here now, aren't I?

31
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,171
You certainly hung out with Eka
on the street.

32
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,084
Shoes off.

33
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,409
What do we eat?

34
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,642
Again beans?
Aren't you fed up with beans yet?

35
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,449
What's wrong with the electricity?
- Call your brother.

36
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,885
Did you not hear me?
Call your brother.

37
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,362
Can I just catch my breath?

38
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,690
Catch your breath...

39
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,241
You must be very tired.

40
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,123
Gio!

41
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,561
Come inside.

42
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,485
Eka, how are you?

43
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,848
You don't talk to me?
- Leave me alone, Kopla.

44
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,844
You can't answer politely?

45
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,527
Get lost. No one says anything to you. 
Got that?

46
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,445
What a big mouth.

47
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,840
Hey, you.

48
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,651
Break off a piece. We are hungry.

49
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,768
Give him a piece of bread.

50
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,129
Here. Take it.

51
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,009
Hello, Eka.
- People are jealous so easily.

52
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,289
Do you know what they blazon abroad about me?

53
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,011
What do you want?
- How can you breathe here?

54
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,687
That's fine.
- You know what I'm gonna do to her?

55
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,365
I will help you.

56
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,241
I'll kill the neighbor.
What do you mean, do I wear tight clothes?

57
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,165
I bought bread.
- No, thank you.

58
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,051
Close the door. For the smoke.

59
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,487
Sorry...

60
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,490
Would you like some water?

61
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,722
And you? Water?

62
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,371
Water?
- No, thank you.

63
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,729
What's wrong? Why is no one saying anything?

64
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,207
Did I do something wrong?

65
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,526
I don't get it.

66
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,446
If you're drunk,
I'm not talking to you.

67
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,967
Are you serious?

68
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,125
Don't you love me?

69
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:14,090
Your mother does not love me anymore.

70
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,489
Fuck off.

71
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,006
What are you doing?

72
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,687
Fantastic. Well done.

73
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,930
Bastard.
- What are you doing? Come here.

74
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,401
Let me go.
- Come here, bitch.

75
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,043
My God.
-Always the same. Shut up.

76
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,841
I won't shut up
and I'm not stopping.

77
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:48,970
Look at him.
Go wash your hands.

78
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,851
Stop it.
- Wash your hands.

79
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,287
Leave me alone.
- You want a slap?

80
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,161
Mind your own business.
- What a big mouth.

81
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,767
You're dirty.
- Just let him.

82
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,123
He only ​​tastes his food 
when there is dirt inside.

83
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,487
Go wash your own hands.

84
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,769
Idiot.
- You're an idiot yourself.

85
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,211
Do you know how many goals
I made, Natela?

86
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,203
A lot.

87
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,283
Do you know?

88
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,011
What do we care?

89
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,561
Then I couldn't care less either.

90
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,365
Listen to that.
They'll end up killing each other.

91
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,841
What happened?
- Get out.

92
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,844
Oh no, What's wrong?

93
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,287
My God.

94
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,047
My wine... But why?

95
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,286
This is no ordinary wine.
What have you done?

96
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,761
Wine gone, and my carafe broken.

97
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,049
It's impossible to live with you.
You guys are crazy.

98
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,249
I can't take it anymore.

99
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,527
Go help your grandmother.

100
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,569
Sit down.

101
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,004
Stop.

102
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,482
Open your notebook.

103
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,284
Silence.

104
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,888
Silence, I said.
- But I...

105
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,690
Shut up.

106
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,289
Shut up.

107
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,963
I'm sorry.

108
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,970
Shanshiashvili graces us with her presence.

109
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,961
A little late, huh?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

110
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:45,411
Why are you late? Did you have to 
comb your hair or iron your uniform?

111
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,085
Silence.

112
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,565
Last night my father came back from
Sukhumi.

113
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,282
This morning we waved him goodbye.
That's why I'm late.

114
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,609
Your father must have brought presents .

115
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,331
What did you get?

116
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,323
Tell me.

117
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:18,410
Who knows why these people go to Abkhazia?

118
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,246
And why so many villains
are involved in that war?

119
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,962
That's not true.
- Shut up. And don't tell nonsense.

120
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,121
Excuse me, ma'am?
- Come in. Sit down, you.

121
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,526
Grab your notebook. So tell me?

122
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,684
Can Zaridze come with me for five minutes?

123
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,571
Why?
- Her mother is downstairs.

124
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,007
Zaridze, you can come.

125
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,929
Very kind of you.
- Never mind.

126
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,764
Come back immediately.

127
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,243
Wait .

128
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,170
She is probably telling 
stupid things also to herself.

129
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,290
Ketino is worse.
- Absolutely.

130
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,082
See you later.
-You get your notebook back tomorrow.

131
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,242
Give me.

132
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,128
Do the flowers come from Kote, do you think?
- Who else?

133
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,084
What would it mean?
- He likes you.

134
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,768
As if you didn't know already .
- Come on, stop it.

135
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,809
It's ok. Come.

136
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,607
You okay, Natia?

137
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,606
Didn't you like the flowers?

138
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,800
Where are you going?
- None of your business.

139
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,487
Are you coming along for a ride?
- Joker.

140
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,247
I kick the others out
to make space for you.

141
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,925
Okay, guys?

142
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,651
Very nice, but no thanks.

143
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,800
Are you okay?
- Yes. And you?

144
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,122
Does your brother know?

145
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,886
Are you crazy?
- Have you already heard?

146
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,044
Guess.
- No idea.

147
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,124
Is my dress too short?
- No, it looks good on you.

148
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,807
Anita thinks it's too short.
- Not at all, nonsense.

149
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,203
Manana is leaving her husband.

150
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,446
Manana gets a divorce?
- Her husband kicked her out.

151
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,171
A while ago.

152
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,690
Did you know she wasn't virgin when she married?
I thought she was so proper.

153
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,322
Don't gossip.
- Do not start again.

154
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,121
If only she had told her husband the truth.

155
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,282
No man puts up with something like that.

156
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,966
Why would you conceal it?

157
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:01,602
You guys are so stupid.
In what time do you live?

158
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,649
Come.

159
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,967
Should we close the place with a big lock?

160
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,283
Bunch of silly virgins.
Stop it.

161
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,407
I'll be up all night walking through your street

162
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,247
I'll wait for you all night

163
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,001
life is so short that you can already see the end

164
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:35,806
I go home and think of you till the morning

165
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,481
life is so short that you can already see the end

166
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,246
I go home and think of you till the morning

167
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,882
you do not know,
you do not know, sweet darling

168
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,681
how my heart is pounding
how my heart beats for you

169
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,004
I'd want to live right in front of your house

170
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,563
and I'd sit until the early morning under your balcony

171
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,567
life is harsh and unfair

172
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,446
if you have a dream it will always break

173
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,120
Sopo, mother's coming.

174
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,201
Shit.
- Quick.

175
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,043
Hurry.

176
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,125
Clean quickly.

177
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,851
Get rid of the fags.

178
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,890
Throw them out.
- Get rid of the smoke.

179
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,724
Hello, madam.

180
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,002
For the umpteenth time:
don't sit in the window.

181
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,644
Continue playing.

182
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,171
Hey, who do we have here?

183
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,927
How are you?
- What do you think? Now you have forgotten about me...

184
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:20,085
Where have you gone?
-I'm just there.

185
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,369
But I don't want to bother you,
like the rest.

186
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,841
Come on, I want to talk to you.

187
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,651
Why? You can talk to me right here, not?

188
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,362
I want to give you a present.
-But it's not my birthday.

189
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,411
I know. You come with me?

190
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,769
I'll be late for music lessons.
-Five minutes.

191
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,650
What will you give me?
-Patience.

192
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:51,168
I'm curious.
- Just wait.

193
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,970
What do you want to do here?
- Look, just come.

194
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,123
Sit down.

195
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,561
What is it?
- Close your eyes.

196
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,644
Oh, come on...
- Please, close them.

197
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,125
Can I open them?
- Not yet. Only when I say so.

198
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,003
Open them.

199
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:34,290
What is that?
- It's for you.

200
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,442
For me?

201
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,604
Take it.
-Is it real?

202
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,286
Don't be afraid. It's not loaded.

203
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,802
You never know what can happen.
This is to protect yourself.

204
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,327
But don't tell anyone.

205
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,840
I'll show you how to load it.

206
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,441
You pull this and take out that.

207
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:12,485
I only have one bullet.
I'll get you more.

208
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,802
You put it in here.

209
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:22,247
Now it's loaded.
- Let me hold it.

210
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,927
Just do'nt shoot.
-Don't worry.

211
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,450
How did you get it?
- What does it matter?

212
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,721
Where will I hide it?

213
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,564
Great.

214
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:57,724
With this in mind, a cease-fire has been
proclaimed in Tskhinvali.

215
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,966
Won't you be in trouble for missing your lesson?
-I'll say that I was sick.

216
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,522
Or you blame me.
- Then she'll forgive you immediately.

217
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,364
Ofcourse.

218
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:12,851
How are you doing anyways?

219
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,130
Normal. Maybe I'll go and 
live with my uncle in Moscow.

220
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,320
But not for long. I won't leave you alone.
- Yes, yes.

221
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,051
I'll come back to marry you.

222
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,207
All okay?
- Hello, Lado.

223
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,169
Where is your uncle?
- In Moscow.

224
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,971
When is he coming?
- Not yet.

225
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,442
Do you know him well?
- He's friends with my uncle.

226
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,970
Do you know him as well?
- At times he visits our downstairs neighbors.

227
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:57,805
If he's there, they sing.
-You like him?

228
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,803
Quite.

229
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:11,322
Do you still go to school?
- Sometimes, sometimes not.

230
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,687
Depends on my mood.

231
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,206
Kote, grab that spare tire.

232
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,761
Quick, we're in a hurry.

233
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,283
Kote?

234
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,489
Kote!

235
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,731
What did you want to show me?

236
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,803
Just wait.

237
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,651
Wait. Where are you going?

238
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,762
Please, Natia.

239
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,687
Where are you going?

240
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,162
You'll see in a moment.

241
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,444
Please, Natia. That's enough.

242
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,804
What did you want me to show me?

243
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,804
Don't move.

244
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,729
I have not seen him since.
He's very busy.

245
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,850
He is doing things with his uncle.

246
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,526
Maybe he is already in Moscow.

247
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:20,364
What does it mean when someone 
gives you something like this?

248
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,127
I think he doesn't want anything 
to happen to you...

249
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,604
like someone treating you disrespectful 
or hurting you.

250
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,810
I think he really loves you.
I think...

251
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,567
He wants you to stay out of trouble.

252
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,684
Yes, I guess you're right.

253
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,208
Now it's my turn...

254
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:04,127
Where have you been? 
You have to come home when it gets dark.

255
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:09,525
Leave me alone, Natela.
- Leave you alone? I'll break your bones.

256
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:15,608
Don't cause any more trouble.
Things are already hard enough.

257
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:19,401
Just take it easy.
- What do you mean, take it easy?

258
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,688
Gio.

259
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,446
Talk to me normally.
- I do.

260
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,321
Gio, open up.
- It's none of your business.

261
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,371
Just get lost.
- Gio, please open.

262
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,603
You're drunk. You're disgusting.

263
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,922
And I love you.

264
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,243
I wish you were dead,
then at least we would have peace.

265
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,006
What did you say? I'll teach you...

266
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,721
What's wrong, Gio?

267
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:59,165
What has happened?
- I'll kill that bastard again.

268
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,484
Come on, you know how he is...

269
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,608
Hush.

270
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,890
You are still sitting there? Come on out.

271
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,205
What are you doing?
Why do you keep sneaking through my stuff?

272
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,681
I won't steal anything.

273
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,927
You've read them, huh?

274
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,968
I haven't read anything.

275
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,964
You should be ashamed, reading other people's letters.

276
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,361
I haven't read anything.

277
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,560
What were you doing with this?
You know that I am keeping those.

278
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,327
What exactly were you looking for?
I'm talking to you.

279
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,929
I was looking for an address.
I wanted to send dad a letter.

280
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,609
Here you go.

281
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,404
I'm hungry.
Don't we have anything to eat?

282
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,722
We'll find something.

283
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:21,202
You should have seen what happened last time.

284
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:25,365
My father was drunk and acted like an idiot.

285
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,127
He smashed a carafe of wine.

286
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,760
Why?

287
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,720
I couldn't care if he would die tomorrow.
-You shouldn't say that.

288
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,645
Really.
- But he's your father.

289
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,326
I couldn't care less.

290
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,801
I don't believe that.

291
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,682
Come on, move it.
- Look at those half-wits.

292
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,920
What's wrong with you? Idiots.

293
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,923
Sorry, did it hurt?

294
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,731
You better watch out, guys.

295
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,680
Come, just let them.
- What? You think this is normal?

296
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:05,049
Calm down, you.
- You shut up.

297
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,885
Should I come down?
- And then?

298
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,125
Wait and see...
- Let him be. He's not normal.

299
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,760
You put up with all of this?

300
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,331
That's why you are acting so tough.

301
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,530
Just go home, Kopla.
- Your friend has a big mouth.

302
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,366
Get lost or you're in trouble.
- With who? With you?

303
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,409
Yes, with me.

304
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,528
You've seen too many Jackie Chan movies.
-Shut up.

305
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,685
And who are you?
- He's with me. Is that a problem?

306
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,923
Go ahead, stab me, if you think you're so tough.

307
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:47,369
Go and take your friend with you.
-Oh yeah? Are you afraid?

308
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,330
Afraid? Come here if you dare.

309
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,245
You'll regret it.
- Now we're getting scared.

310
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,443
Come.

311
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:59,809
Why do you react like that to those guys?

312
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:04,124
Because you think like that they treat you like dirt.

313
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,527
Let them think what they want.

314
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,968
Let them stew in their juice next time.

315
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,411
So I can't say anything?
Am I your friend or just a classmate?

316
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,169
I did not mean it like that.
-Okay, I'll never stand up for you anymore.

317
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,243
Don't be angry.

318
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,570
If it's a real guy,
he arranges everything with your father.

319
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,601
Is that it?
- Yes.

320
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,323
Is Eka coming?
- No, she's not going.

321
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,688
Ana, get in.

322
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,847
Guram, wait.

323
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,765
Mom, she's really not coming.

324
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,400
Five minutes. I'll be right back.

325
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,362
Will you come with me?

326
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,443
Don't feel like it.

327
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,003
Come on, he'd like to see you. 
Get dressed.

328
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,650
No.

329
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,441
You promised.

330
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,282
Come on, please...

331
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,004
What should I tell him?

332
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,810
I don't know.

333
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,287
Just tell him I have a fever.

334
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,647
Take care of yourself.

335
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,889
Hey, watch out.

336
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,521
Let's go to the toilet.

337
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,641
Block the door and don't let anyone in.

338
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,648
I brought this for you.
- What for?

339
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,724
To protect yourself against Kopla.
Take it.

340
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,644
Are you crazy?

341
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,690
A moment, there is a teacher inside.

342
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,808
Stupid bitches.

343
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:44,640
Put it ​​in your bag.
-I'm not saying you have to shoot him.

344
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,087
Just frighten him.

345
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,368
That'll teach him.

346
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:53,804
That's ridiculous.
- Then at least the thing has some use.

347
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,409
And then?
-Teach him a lesson, then he'll leave you alone.

348
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,009
How long will you still put up with this?
This is the kind of language those guys understand.

349
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,766
Otherwise they'll never leave you alone.

350
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,844
What nonsense.

351
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,800
And how incredibly stupid to take 
that thing to school.

352
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,167
Do you want me to do it?

353
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,322
I think you're just afraid.

354
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,487
Open up.
-A moment.

355
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,290
Can't you wait a moment?
- Did you fall into the crapper?

356
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,890
Imbecile.

357
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:40,330
I'm not an imbecile.
- Get lost.

358
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,247
Don't you dare to hit me.

359
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,567
Give back.
- Look...

360
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,883
Give back.
- What a stupid picture.

361
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,646
Give back. Do you hear me?

362
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,531
Look.

363
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,762
Why did you force that thing on me?
- You really don't get it.

364
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,684
Nonsense.

365
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,204
Stop it.

366
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,445
Give it back to her.

367
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,491
Give it back to her.

368
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,248
He ripped her photo.
- Stupid idiot.

369
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,767
You're a bastard.
- Hey, you...

370
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:51,129
Are you talking to me?
- Yes. Give me my bag.

371
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,011
You want your bag? Please.

372
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,208
You're crazy.

373
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,889
Zaridze...

374
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,891
Leave the classroom.

375
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,522
You get a zero today.

376
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,524
A zero for throwing bags?

377
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,126
Yes, for throwing bags.

378
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,045
I think I deserve a higher grade.

379
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,168
Silence.

380
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,766
Get out. Immediately.

381
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,684
Quiet now. Open your notebook.

382
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,330
It was Zaridze's fault.
-Sit.

383
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,811
Punish me as well...

384
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,406
if you like.

385
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,525
What? You're not going anywhere.

386
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,685
Back to your place.
- I want to get out of here as well.

387
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,526
Don't you dare.
With your big mouth.

388
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,608
Paichadze!

389
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,970
Open the window.
It's suffocating.

390
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:21,127
Hey, Zaridze. Wait.
We're coming as well.

391
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:25,001
Get lost.
- What are you doing, Paichadze?

392
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,891
Are you crazy?

393
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,522
Where are you going?
Have you completely lost...

394
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,644
See you tomorrow.

395
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,649
You'll catch a cold.

396
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,007
None of your business.

397
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,611
Who was that guy with whom I 
saw you the other day?

398
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,411
Guy? He has a name.

399
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:52,570
Why? Are you jealous?
-Wait.

400
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,887
Are you in love with him?
- You know what I love?

401
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,840
My parents and bread with butter.
-Wait.

402
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,442
I want to say something.
Something important.

403
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,483
Will you marry me?
-What?

404
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,121
I'm serious.
I'll ask you only once.

405
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,411
Think about it. You have two weeks.
- I don't need to think about it.

406
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,688
The answer is no.

407
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,969
Why not?
- Because you're an idiot.

408
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,721
I told you to stay away from that car. 
Asshole.

409
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,123
Leave him alone.

410
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:47,930
Put that thing away or I'll put it in your...

411
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:55,170
Let him go or I'll shoot.
- Calm down.

412
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,570
Didn't you hear what I said?

413
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:05,691
Get lost. Both of you.
And give him his knife back.

414
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,364
Come on.

415
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,724
Bye.

416
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,087
You're soaked. Is it raining that hard?

417
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,641
Eka, you have cigarettes?

418
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,724
You know I don't smoke?

419
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,684
Sorry.
- You have any money instead?

420
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:23,122
No.
- That kid is useless.

421
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,886
What did you say you were doing?
-I was reading.

422
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,725
Oh yeah? What book?

423
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,805
Stop. Let's go smoke.
- We don't have any cigarettes.

424
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:35,566
Then look better.

425
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,601
I have to go. I'll call again later.
You're home, right?

426
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:44,162
Talk to you soon.
You couldn't wait two seconds?

427
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,810
My god.

428
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,247
Where are you going?

429
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,723
It's like talking to a wall
with that guy.

430
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,611
What?
- Why did you take that cigarette?

431
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,207
Because I felt like it.
I'll buy some new ones.

432
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:10,085
You're ashamed of nothing.
-Fuck off.

433
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:14,524
Stupid bitch.
- Don't talk to your big sister like that.

434
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:18,171
What's wrong with that kid?

435
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,483
Stupid kid. She drives me crazy.

436
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:27,520
Stupid bitch. My mother was saving it for
when my father was released.

437
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,651
I'll buy new ones.
There are plenty of cigarettes in the world.

438
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,010
Where were we?
Oh yes, he doesn't get it at all.

439
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:42,247
Doesn't he know that there are demonstrations?
- Apparently not. Or he pretends.

440
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:46,928
Don't sit there soaking wet. What is it this time?
- Did you cry?

441
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:51,528
Give me a puff.

442
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,209
Make sure no one jumps the queue.

443
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,527
Everybody queue up.

444
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,523
Eka.

445
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,807
Do you have money for me?
- Yeah, come here.

446
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,161
Just start selling.

447
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:03,288
Hello.

448
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,165
Give me bread. Ten loaves.

449
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,209
Don't you have to wait in line?
- Quiet.

450
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,921
The queue isn't meant for you?
What are you looking at?

451
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,481
You should be ashamed.

452
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:21,769
What's wrong with this country?

453
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,607
What are you doing?
Leave her alone.

454
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,087
Let her go.

455
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,643
Natia!

456
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,969
Assholes.

457
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,531
Bunch of cowards.

458
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,723
Assholes. Cowards.
I hope you die.

459
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:28,203
Bunch of cowards, bastards.
Motherfuckers.

460
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,331
What?
- You heard me. Go to hell.

461
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:34,881
Stupid bitch.
- What are you doing?

462
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,001
Has he completely lost his mind?

463
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,291
No thanks.

464
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:01,204
Let's go to the toilet.
I want to give you something.

465
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,488
Go. I'll be there.

466
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,930
Can I pass?

467
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,767
Dear friends.
Attention to the master of ceremonies.

468
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,049
Dear friends.

469
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,084
Let's make a toast.

470
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,891
To our amazing women.

471
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:30,247
To their beauty.

472
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:35,850
What would our lives be worth
without them?

473
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,810
Blessed are all women.
-Cheers.

474
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:43,170
Cheers.
- To the women.

475
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:47,564
All at once:
to our women.

476
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,045
To our women.

477
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:53,204
You can do better. Cheers.

478
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,648
Eka, it's me.

479
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,882
Good thing you got me out of there.
I can never sit still for a long time.

480
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,645
But it was a beautiful wedding, huh?

481
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,882
Yes.

482
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,850
Check if my dress is closed properly.

483
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,844
What did you want to give me?
No present, though.

484
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,321
I couldn't find anything.

485
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,524
Here you go.

486
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:56,080
Did you want to present this to me?

487
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:05,968
How'd it go? Did you seen Kopla?

488
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,321
Did you scare him?
- I haven't seen him.

489
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,603
Come.
-Wait, I want to say something.

490
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,728
What is it?

491
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,042
Do you love that guy?

492
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,171
I think so.

493
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,482
I think I love him.

494
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,883
What are you looking at?
What do you want to know?

495
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:42,441
He didn't force me.
It just happened.

496
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,087
He's a good man.

497
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,730
Really.

498
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,368
That's sweet of you.

499
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,521
And Lado?

500
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,605
What about Lado?
What does he have to do with anything?

501
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,769
Come.

502
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,207
Just go. I'll be there in a moment.

503
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,124
We sat in the car
and I couldn't see anything.

504
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,325
I had no idea where I was.
-Where did they take you?

505
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,482
Somewhere outside the city.

506
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,007
Then what happened? Tell me.

507
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:07,802
We went into a house.
- The family album of Kote.

508
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:14,206
A man told me I was now Kote's wife 
and then I had to peel potatoes.

509
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,727
Did you want to stay there?

510
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:18,803
I guess...

511
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,884
How could I have escaped?

512
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,567
They said that I would fall in love with him.

513
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,848
So I stayed.

514
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,401
Did it hurt, the first time?

515
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,049
Hey, stop it.

516
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,443
They are dancing.
- Even your dad is dancing.

517
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,524
My dad?
- He's drunk.

518
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,809
What's the matter?
Not happy that I got married?

519
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,650
Of course I am..
-You don't look it.

520
01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:11,283
Awake?

521
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,483
Was it a nice wedding?
- Quite.

522
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:18,530
You'd like a tea?
- Please.

523
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:31,444
Is it better? Does it still hurt?

524
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:33,250
No.

525
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,282
Mom?

526
01:07:41,440 --> 01:07:45,331
Is it true that daddy
killed the father of Kopla?

527
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:48,090
No.

528
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:59,762
Why?
Has anyone said something about that?

529
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,809
No....

530
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:08,521
But is it true?

531
01:08:13,520 --> 01:08:15,761
No, it's not true.

532
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:33,129
I'm going.

533
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:38,162
Wake Sopo later.
She has an exam.

534
01:09:32,520 --> 01:09:34,966
Sorry. Do you have candles?

535
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,445
Two.

536
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:47,011
U.S. state that starts with an O and 
ends with an O. Four letters.

537
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:50,084
Ohio.
- Ohio. Very good.

538
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,766
Do you have eggs?
- No.

539
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,686
Coach of the Argentine national team...
- I don't know.

540
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,810
Eka...

541
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:22,848
I missed you.

542
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,006
Kote's mother baked this.

543
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,567
It is delicious. Taste it.

544
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,610
How's school?
- Normal.

545
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:49,446
And how are you?
- Well, I guess.

546
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:53,047
But how's school? Tell.

547
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,171
We have holiday soon.
It's exam week.

548
01:10:57,320 --> 01:11:01,211
They're asking for you.
-Really. Who?

549
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:04,204
Lela, Paichadze, Achiko...

550
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,250
They are curious how you are doing.
They miss you.

551
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,482
I miss them too.

552
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,251
No more music lessons?

553
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,721
Ah...
- What do you mean?

554
01:11:16,240 --> 01:11:18,811
Kote doesn't want me to go to music lessons.

555
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:22,009
He doesn't want me to be a pianist.

556
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:26,091
So now you do everything that he wants?
I don't get it.

557
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:31,648
I don't only do what he wants.

558
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:35,048
You do, and you know it.

559
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,922
You think so?
Are you here to interrogate me?

560
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:42,082
Thanks a lot.

561
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,884
Come on, Natia...

562
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,931
Don't be mad.

563
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,242
I did not mean it like that.

564
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,571
Has something happened?

565
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:10,609
Come on, tell.

566
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,771
My birthday is soon...

567
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:17,645
and I wanted to invite some friends.

568
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:21,845
Jou, Lela, Achiko,
a few guys as well.

569
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,562
But I'm not allowed.
They don't have any money left, they say.

570
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:29,326
They made debts for the wedding.

571
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:33,201
I told them that you could bring your own.

572
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,443
But like that I would bring disgrace to the family.

573
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,490
Then we'll simply go to your family?

574
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:42,841
I can't stand them.

575
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,642
Then we'll celebrate it at your place. 
So you don't have to see their faces.

576
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:51,327
As if my father's face is so much better...

577
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,125
When I go home, he'll be furious.

578
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,209
Hello, Eka.

579
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,731
Are you okay?
- Yes. You too?

580
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:15,721
Natia, where's my black shirt?
-I do not know

581
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,527
Search for it. I have to go.

582
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:21,569
I don't have time now.

583
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:32,801
Help searching. I am in a hurry.

584
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,327
Really?

585
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:38,370
Can't you see that I have guests?

586
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:39,931
Calm down, Natia.

587
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,004
Are you crazy?
- Yes.

588
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,846
Get lost with your shirts and socks.

589
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:50,846
What are you looking at?

590
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,447
I've had it with your socks and shirts.

591
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:56,841
What's wrong?

592
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:00,209
Why are you talking so loud? Kote...

593
01:14:03,160 --> 01:14:05,481
What happened?
- Leave me alone.

594
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,126
What is going on?

595
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:16,729
Come on, I'm asking what is wrong.
Why did you get so crazy?

596
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,288
You're driving me crazy.

597
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:46,450
There you are, sweetheart.

598
01:14:46,560 --> 01:14:48,403
You're so big.

599
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:52,206
Congratulations.
Congratulations, darling.

600
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:55,442
Hi, sweetheart.
- Everything okay with you?

601
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:59,571
And with you and your mother?
- Fine, thank you.

602
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:02,371
That smells delicious.
What did you make?

603
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:08,562
All things that you like.
I missed you terribly.

604
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:12,366
Can I help?
- No, honey. Everything is ready.

605
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:14,960
I'm serving.

606
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,365
What is that?
- Hands off.

607
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:22,091
Hurry, Natela. I'm hungry.

608
01:15:22,240 --> 01:15:26,165
Everything is ready on the balcony.
Wait, come here.

609
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,051
Here's the wine. Delicious wine.

610
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:32,124
And you take the bread.

611
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:37,730
Everything is ready. You can already prepare the dishes.
I finish this and I come.

612
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,202
Moment. First this...

613
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,088
Look what I have baked for you.

614
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,329
Enjoy, girls.

615
01:15:51,480 --> 01:15:54,529
There is plenty.
I forgot a knife...

616
01:15:54,680 --> 01:15:57,968
It looks delicious.
- My favorite.

617
01:15:59,040 --> 01:16:02,249
Grandma has really made a feast.

618
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:05,449
How did you do that, Natela?

619
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:09,161
Borrowed money?
- Or did you go to the pawnshop.

620
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:14,848
Come with your glass.

621
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,242
In one gulp.
- Good.

622
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:33,408
Cheers, Natela.

623
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,722
To your grandmother.
- Cheers.

624
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,249
To your grandmother and all sweet grandmothers of the world.

625
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,483
And to your health.
-And yours.

626
01:16:55,280 --> 01:16:57,328
Completely empty.

627
01:16:57,480 --> 01:16:59,164
Cheers.

628
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:06,291
How hungry I was.
- Dig in.

629
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,683
There's Lado...

630
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:34,643
Come.

631
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:54,681
You do not know, honey, you do not know...

632
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:58,646
What's up, Natia?
- Good. And you?

633
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,451
Everything okay, Eka?
- Yes.

634
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:16,800
And I'd sit until the early morning under your balcony

635
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:23,881
I'd want to live right in front of your house

636
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,768
and I'd sit until the early morning under your balcony

637
01:18:33,440 --> 01:18:37,365
life is harsh and unfair

638
01:18:40,840 --> 01:18:44,811
if you have a dream it will always break

639
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:54,522
Hello.

640
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,886
What are you doing here?
- Just hanging.

641
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:03,601
Come home.
- No, I'll stay here.

642
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:07,082
Come, I said.
- What does he think...

643
01:19:07,240 --> 01:19:09,129
I'll see you tomorrow.

644
01:20:28,560 --> 01:20:30,289
Natia?

645
01:20:30,400 --> 01:20:32,641
Are you here?

646
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,764
Do you come? The food is ready.

647
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:42,047
Natia, do you hear me?

648
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,568
The food is ready.
We are waiting for you.

649
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,487
Natia, come. Now.

650
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,408
Do you hear me? Come out.
The food is getting cold.

651
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:08,369
I'm coming.

652
01:21:30,680 --> 01:21:35,368
... bombing in Sukhumi. According to the 
latest information no one was hurt.

653
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:40,651
So that's it: Yura has gone there.

654
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:44,771
Where?
- Yura's son to Abkhazia.

655
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:49,164
I know. I do not wanna talk about it.
-You realize what he has done?

656
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:53,609
He's dead, his family is broken. 
Poor people.

657
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:57,685
Stupid kid. Children
cause nothing but trouble.

658
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,849
Enough. When I heard...

659
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:05,649
Take some bread.

660
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:09,250
Here you go.

661
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,241
Hey, you.
- Do you have cigarettes?

662
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:44,607
I do not smoke.
-Wait.

663
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:55,607
Don't you recognize me?

664
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,090
Come here.

665
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,004
Do not move.

666
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:08,491
I'll kill you, motherfucker.
- Do not let him escape.

667
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,562
Come here, asshole.

668
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:34,928
Where are you running?

669
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,561
Son of a bitch.

670
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,404
Let's go.

671
01:24:52,720 --> 01:24:54,290
Asshole.

672
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,050
Run.

673
01:25:00,640 --> 01:25:02,608
Natia, wait.

674
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,324
Wait.

675
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,606
Open the door.
- Don't.

676
01:25:15,800 --> 01:25:17,802
What's wrong?

677
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,849
What's wrong?

678
01:25:24,120 --> 01:25:26,282
Don't.
- Let me go.

679
01:25:26,440 --> 01:25:30,411
Tell me what is going on.

680
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:33,245
What's going on?
- Eka!

681
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:37,883
You're driving me crazy.
You'll break the door.

682
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:41,408
Open up.
-Come on out.

683
01:25:41,560 --> 01:25:45,849
Didn't you hear what I said?

684
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,889
Now listen for a minute...

685
01:25:52,120 --> 01:25:55,841
Give it to me.
- What the hell is going on here?

686
01:25:57,040 --> 01:25:59,407
Have you lost your mind?

687
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:06,765
What's going on here?
Calm down.

688
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:08,604
Give it.

689
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:12,287
Listen to me.
Why are you screaming like that?

690
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:14,568
Give it.
- Come here, you.

691
01:26:14,720 --> 01:26:17,803
Tell me.
- Didn't you hear me?

692
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,368
Give it.
- No.

693
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,646
I hate you.
- Have you gone crazy?

694
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:36,327
Get out of the kitchen.
-Stay out of this. That bitch...

695
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:39,563
You think you're at home?

696
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:42,200
Shut up.
- Street girl.

697
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:45,728
I give you a home and this is what I get.

698
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:50,886
You're crazy.
Do you think she's your daughter?

699
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:55,489
Where is Kote?
Where's that husband of yours?

700
01:26:55,640 --> 01:27:01,170
I asked where Kote is.
- That son of yours has killed somebody.

701
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,049
Is it clear now?

702
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:06,728
You got it now?

703
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:21,605
Is it true what she's saying?

704
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:30,844
I'm going out.
I'm going to figure out if this is true.

705
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,367
I'm coming along.
- You wait here.

706
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:36,922
You don't get to decide what I do.

707
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:41,529
Stop bitching, woman.
You're all crazy.

708
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:00,324
Eka, give it.
How often do I have to say?

709
01:28:02,840 --> 01:28:04,604
Clear?

710
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:09,444
It's mine, not yours.

711
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:11,728
Is that clear?

712
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,123
Give it. It'is mine.

713
01:28:16,120 --> 01:28:18,407
Okay, I'll give it back.

714
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:21,370
No one will take it away from you.

715
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:23,204
Take it.

716
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:28,451
It's yours. Why aren't you taking it?
Take it.

717
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:32,046
Kote should die as well?

718
01:28:33,760 --> 01:28:36,923
You know where he is.
Go and kill him.

719
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:52,729
Come.

720
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:56,291
Is this the entrance?
- Mom, this right here is the entrance, isn't it?

721
01:31:56,440 --> 01:31:58,408
Yes.
- Thanks.

722
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:03,203
Where are you going?

723
01:32:03,360 --> 01:32:05,601
The visitors' entrance?
Yes.

724
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,848
Let's see inside.

725
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:19,091
Okay, yeah, fine. I'm hanging up.

726
01:32:20,720 --> 01:32:22,404
Documents.

727
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:31,721
First name?

728
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:33,609
Eka.

729
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,084
Last name?

730
01:32:39,240 --> 01:32:41,288
Khizanishvili.

731
01:32:44,120 --> 01:32:47,488
How old are you?
- Fourteen.

732
01:32:57,240 --> 01:32:59,766
Relation to the prisoner?

733
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,843
He's my father.

734
01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:25,882
Do not put them there, but there.

735
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:36,683
Dad, do you have the 
passports and documents?

736
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:38,808
No, you have them.

737
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,808
Khizanishvili?

738
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:53,363
That's me.
- Come on, girl.

739
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,003
Turn right.
