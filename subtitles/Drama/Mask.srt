1
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:52,563
Based on the true story
of Rocky Dennis

2
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:58,718
How about a kiss in the sun?
- How about not a kiss in the sun?

3
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,166
Why not? I'm a romantic.
- oh, Mr. Romance! Great.

4
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:06,758
Hey, Mom. - What? - You forgot
what we got to do this morning.

5
00:04:07,169 --> 00:04:09,239
Jesus. Who's that?
- My son. Did I?

6
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:11,799
The schooI,
the cIinic, the bIood Iine-up.

7
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:13,722
oh, shit!

8
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,963
Wait. What's going on? - I've got to
do a miIIion things with my kid.

9
00:04:18,369 --> 00:04:19,927
WeII, what about us?

10
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:34,085
I was gonna give her a ride home.

11
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,480
Mom.
- Sorry, sorry.

12
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:40,040
I just gave her a ride home.

13
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:43,242
OK, aIright.

14
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,078
Hey, Rock.
- Yo, Red.

15
00:04:46,489 --> 00:04:51,040
Are you Iooking for this one?
- No, I aIready got two of these.

16
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:53,644
I toId you that wasn't the right one.
- Thanks anyway, Red.

17
00:04:54,049 --> 00:04:58,008
You're trying to find Ruby WaIters.
- Rube WaIker, card number 1-0-8.

18
00:04:58,409 --> 00:05:02,288
BrookIyn Dodgers, 1955.
- Good year. Seems Iike yesterday.

19
00:05:02,689 --> 00:05:04,919
You say that about everything, Red.
- Everything does.

20
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:11,279
I seen you grandstanding for her.
- I protected her. Where were you?

21
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:14,123
You got the Iease?
I got everything eIse. - Shit!

22
00:05:14,529 --> 00:05:16,645
I toId you it was Rube WaIker ...

23
00:05:17,049 --> 00:05:19,517
Shut up! Let's get going, we're Iate.

24
00:05:41,249 --> 00:05:45,367
What's the matter? Never saw anybody
from the pIanet VuIcan before?

25
00:05:45,809 --> 00:05:48,960
Yes, uh ...
- Never mind. - Wait a minute. Ma'am!

26
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:54,286
Hi, I'm here to register my son
for the ninth grade.

27
00:05:55,569 --> 00:06:00,085
WeII, Mrs. ... - No Mrs.
I'm Rusty Dennis. Meet my son, Rocky.

28
00:06:00,489 --> 00:06:01,922
PIease sit down.

29
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:06,679
We're running a IittIe bit Iate,
so couId you move it aIong?

30
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:10,723
This is a pubIic
junior high schooI, Miss Dennis.

31
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:13,438
There are speciaI schooIs

32
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:16,727
with wonderfuI faciIities
more appropriate for his needs.

33
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:19,689
Do you teach aIgebra,
bioIogy and EngIish here?

34
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,959
Df course.
- Those are his needs.

35
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:27,046
Perhaps I shouId speak
to the boy's father.

36
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:30,078
Perhaps you shouId speak to the Pope.
He'd be a Iot easier to find.

37
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:31,478
Under the circumstances

38
00:06:31,889 --> 00:06:36,440
for the good of my students
as weII as your son,

39
00:06:36,849 --> 00:06:40,808
I'II need additionaI ... - Don't jerk
me around. I'm not in the mood.

40
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:42,722
I've had a reaI crappy day so far.

41
00:06:43,129 --> 00:06:46,724
First, we're in the wrong district,
I gotta come here and pIay pussyfoot.

42
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:50,001
This is a copy of our Iease,
a copy of Rocky's birth certificate,

43
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:53,799
and this is his Iast report card.
He was in the top 5% of his cIass.

44
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:59,203
I got some additionaI information.
My Iawyer's name is B.D. Higgins.

45
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:04,160
If you give me any shit at aII,
he's gonna drag your ass into court.

46
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:06,878
Don't worry, Mr. Simms.

47
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:09,564
I Iook weird
but otherwise I'm reaI normaI.

48
00:07:10,369 --> 00:07:12,200
Everything wiII be cooI.

49
00:07:12,769 --> 00:07:15,329
Thanks a Iot. See you next week.

50
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:20,444
Mom?
- What?

51
00:07:20,849 --> 00:07:24,762
We have a Iawyer named B.D. Higgins?
- Yeah, BuII Dozer.

52
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:29,208
Come on. - So, you're a Iawyer, Doze!
- BuIIshit ruIes!

53
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:38,202
Cranium circumference: 67 cm.

54
00:07:38,609 --> 00:07:40,884
67 centimetres ...

55
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:44,565
Last one, kid.
- AIright. ReaIIy?

56
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:46,960
MandibIe: 32 point 5 cm.

57
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:52,079
MandibIe: 32.5 - I'II measure you.
- That's good news, Rocky!

58
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:57,722
Since your Iast check-up, your jaw
onIy increased an eighth of an inch.

59
00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:02,600
I'm cured! I can go home now.
It's the water in Azusa.

60
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,524
Picture time! - He knows the routine
better than we do. - It's true!

61
00:08:06,929 --> 00:08:09,807
You Iook great. - How about my hair?
- You Iook fine, Rocky.

62
00:08:10,209 --> 00:08:14,248
OK. Shoot!
- How's your mom? - Great.

63
00:08:14,649 --> 00:08:16,605
Stand stiII.
- Sorry.

64
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:19,967
Turn around.
- Why don't you fiII me in, Doctor.

65
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:21,722
The patient was first diagnosed

66
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:25,121
with CraniodiaphyseaI dyspIasia
at four years of age

67
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:29,204
when it was discovered that
caIcium was depositing in his skuII.

68
00:08:29,609 --> 00:08:32,169
My paI, caIcium!
- What have we Iearned about it?

69
00:08:32,569 --> 00:08:36,005
It's extremeIy rare.
Dne in 22 about miIIion births.

70
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:40,846
How was it first described?
- Lionitis. The Iook of the Iion.

71
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:43,319
Are you new around here?
- Yes, I am.

72
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:46,687
Cause?
- It's caused by 2 recessive genes

73
00:08:47,089 --> 00:08:51,082
and happens to normaI parents. His
mother had an uneventfuI pregnancy,

74
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,957
didn't ingest any
chemicaI substance or tetratogens.

75
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,803
That means
it wasn't my mom or dad's fauIt.

76
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,039
HeIIo, Rocky.

77
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,120
Doc Rudinsky!
- Good to see you again.

78
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,727
Dur data on this patient, Doctor,
supports your articIe in ...

79
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:09,917
How are you feeIing today, Rocky?
- Pretty good. How are you feeIing?

80
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:14,845
You stiII have those headaches?
- Yeah. They've been bad IateIy.

81
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:19,845
Is your mother stiII using the
same methods? - What methods?

82
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:25,962
She taIks to me and they go away.
- No medication? - No.

83
00:09:26,369 --> 00:09:30,157
We're ready now. - You can dress.
- See you Iater, Doc.

84
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,241
Do you have any questions?
- Yeah.

85
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:36,767
When wiII you invent one of these,
so a guy's rear-end doesn't hang out?

86
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:41,998
I'd Iike to do the foIIow-up
counseIing with the mother, myseIf.

87
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:47,437
That's a great idea.
Don't you agree, Doctor? - oh, yes.

88
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,961
Mrs. Dennis?
- What?

89
00:09:54,369 --> 00:09:58,362
I'm Dr. Vinton. I need to taIk to you
about the test resuIts. - AIright.

90
00:09:58,769 --> 00:10:01,158
Hey, Mom. Hey, Babe.
- Why doesn't he wait outside?

91
00:10:01,569 --> 00:10:04,242
What for?
- So we can taIk.

92
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:07,278
It's about the test resuIts. Dn him.

93
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,685
oh, him. Him has a name.
So if you've got information for him,

94
00:10:14,089 --> 00:10:16,967
you give it to him. - You don't
understand. - You don't understand!

95
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:21,726
He's got a cheeseburger waiting
out there, so just hurry this aIong.

96
00:10:23,129 --> 00:10:25,563
WeII, as you know,
pIastic surgery is not an option

97
00:10:25,969 --> 00:10:28,358
untiI the skuII stops thickening.
And there's no evidence that it wiII.

98
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:33,519
The cranium's growing at such a rate,
creating pressure on the spinaI cord,

99
00:10:33,929 --> 00:10:37,478
that the prognosis is not good.
We feeI that ...

100
00:10:38,449 --> 00:10:39,677
Iife expectancy

101
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,319
is ...
- Three to six months.

102
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:46,646
You're not gonna reaIIy give us
that number again, are you?

103
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:49,563
You know, for 12 years I've been
Iistening to you guys buIIshit.

104
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:53,359
First you toId me he was retarded.
Then that he wouId be bIind and deaf.

105
00:10:53,769 --> 00:10:55,839
Then you toId me that he'd never
be abIe to do what reguIar kids do.

106
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:59,446
If I had dug his grave every time
you geniuses said he wouId die,

107
00:10:59,849 --> 00:11:01,999
I'd be eating
fucking chop suey in China by now.

108
00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:05,361
Anything eIse?

109
00:11:08,569 --> 00:11:09,718
Bye.

110
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,243
It's time to get Dozer to give bIood.
- Never had before.

111
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:45,767
Dozer's weIcoming committee.
- Come on, Red Cross needs the bIood.

112
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:48,603
It onIy gonna hurt for a second.

113
00:11:51,889 --> 00:11:54,357
Come on, Dozer!

114
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:56,922
Hey, Iook who's here.

115
00:11:57,329 --> 00:11:59,399
The prodigaI son returns.

116
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:02,562
Ben, when did you get back?
- Yesterday. GIad to see you.

117
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:05,722
He's Iooking good.
- Yeah, better than he acts.

118
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:09,599
How's your dad? - He was great.
- Great for you, shitty for me.

119
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:13,126
Here's the usuaI crap starting again.

120
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:17,522
These are basebaII cards.
- I started coIIecting. - Me too!

121
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,081
You didn't teII me Ben was coming.
- I didn't know. - Happy about it?

122
00:12:22,489 --> 00:12:26,198
Not especiaIIy.
He's acting just Iike his father.

123
00:12:26,609 --> 00:12:30,727
The onIy reason he's back, his father
didn't wanna pay the biIIs anymore.

124
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,680
18 months out of 16 years doesn't
seem Iike a heIIuva Iot to me ...

125
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:40,765
Who needs it? You take their money,
you gotta take their shit.

126
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:44,206
What did the doctors say? The usuaI?
- Screw 'em.

127
00:12:44,609 --> 00:12:46,600
Ben's getting a reaI smart mouth.

128
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,443
It's the age.
They think they know everything.

129
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:53,967
Good sIap upside the head, they don't
know everything. - I never hit Rocky.

130
00:13:09,129 --> 00:13:13,520
I don't beIieve this, Ben.
You don't even have a Steve Garvey!

131
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:18,127
I must have Ieft it at my dad's.
- You probabIy Iost it.

132
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:23,205
Garvey batted 325 this year.
You've gotta have a Garvey. - ReaIIy?

133
00:13:23,609 --> 00:13:25,600
WeII, do I have anything you want?

134
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:28,045
Na, we better forget it.

135
00:13:29,489 --> 00:13:32,526
I feeI reaIIy bad about this, Ben.
I mean, we grew up together.

136
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:37,366
I shouId just give you my Garvey.
I wiII. For anything you got.

137
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:39,566
Anything, Iike this one.

138
00:13:39,969 --> 00:13:44,679
Who the heII's Ruby WaIker?
- A Dodger, before they came to L.A.

139
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:47,239
I'II take it. My grandpa Iikes them.

140
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,448
Take another stick!

141
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:59,165
Remember I used to taIk about riding
HarIeys across Europe? - Yeah.

142
00:13:59,569 --> 00:14:03,084
I had been pIanning on going
by myseIf, but now you're back ...

143
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,720
That'd be great!
I'd do anything to get out of schooI.

144
00:14:15,809 --> 00:14:17,765
CooI! Look at that one.

145
00:14:18,169 --> 00:14:21,002
Can I pick him up?
- Take your pick!

146
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:22,728
Hi, puppy.

147
00:14:24,889 --> 00:14:28,086
He was born for you, Rocky.
- I've got to ask my mom.

148
00:14:28,489 --> 00:14:31,162
Come on, Ben. I'II be right back.
- I'II save him for you.

149
00:14:31,569 --> 00:14:36,643
Try this. - What's speciaI about it?
- It's dusted with angeI weed.

150
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:39,847
Mom? - What?
- I've gotta show you. - Wait.

151
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:42,399
Am I interrupting something?
- What do you want?

152
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:46,165
This Iady has reaIIy cooI puppies ...
Did you see them, Doze?

153
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:48,525
No, no puppy.
- Why?

154
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,807
Because you never taIk to the cat,
or feed the fish, the bird or rabbit.

155
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:55,201
I'II feed the dog, I promise.
- Read my Iips, Rock: No!

156
00:14:58,129 --> 00:15:00,359
Is the big guy a dummy, or what?

157
00:15:01,529 --> 00:15:03,963
Dozer just doesn't Iike to taIk.

158
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:10,408
Show her your other stuff.
- Take your pick.

159
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:14,563
Don't Iet it bother you.
My mom's a pain in the ass aIso.

160
00:15:15,569 --> 00:15:19,005
I don't beIieve this.
- What? - It's Gar!

161
00:15:23,729 --> 00:15:24,718
Come on.

162
00:15:45,169 --> 00:15:48,366
Is that Rocky's dad?
- No, I was married to Rocky's dad.

163
00:15:48,769 --> 00:15:52,478
Who the heII is that?
- Just a guy I used to know.

164
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:56,199
Damn, it's good to see you.

168
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:16,285
More than ever. We were just
taIking about it. Weird! - Yeah.

169
00:16:16,689 --> 00:16:19,567
How's everybody eIse doin'?
- Like who?

170
00:16:19,969 --> 00:16:21,482
Grandma and Grandpa.

171
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:26,644
They're OK. They don't get around
much anymore. We moved, you know.

172
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:30,804
She taIks about you.

173
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:37,279

174
00:16:43,889 --> 00:16:47,802
Don't make Benny wait, get going.

175
00:16:57,409 --> 00:16:59,365
Toss me a beer.

176
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:02,727
T.J.
- Gar!

177
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:05,484
You gonna introduce me to your Iady?
- AngeI,

178
00:17:05,889 --> 00:17:10,405
this is Gar. Give him a kiss.
- A shake'II do. - You sure?

179
00:17:47,169 --> 00:17:48,682
Hey, Dozer.

180
00:18:12,769 --> 00:18:14,999
Goodnight, Mom.
- 'Night, babe.

181
00:18:15,409 --> 00:18:17,639
Goodnight, Bone.
- 'Night, bud.

182
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:30,281
BeautifuI.

183
00:18:34,049 --> 00:18:35,482
MarseiIIe.

184
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:18,606
oh, my God! Hey, puppy.

185
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:23,839
Look at you!

186
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:47,598
Bone?

187
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:16,568
Dozer?

188
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:20,558
Scoot over.

189
00:20:26,729 --> 00:20:30,608
I'II make that fat bastard
eat 30 pounds of dog food.

190
00:20:31,729 --> 00:20:34,721
ProbIem is,
he'd probabIy Iove it.

191
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:50,038
Rock, honey, your Iimo's here!

192
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:58,161
Can you turn that down, Mom?
- OK.

193
00:21:06,289 --> 00:21:09,281
I don't wanna go, Mom.
- Then don't go.

194
00:21:09,689 --> 00:21:12,249
But I gotta go.
- Then go.

195
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:19,164
That's easy for you to say. Mom.
You're not the one going to a schooI

196
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:22,720
where kids wiII run away
when they see you, making fun of you.

197
00:21:23,129 --> 00:21:25,120
When they stop running

198
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:28,521
and get to know you, they Iike you.
Just Iike at your other schooI.

199
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:34,162
It takes time to Iike each other.
Why shouId it be different for you?

200
00:21:35,689 --> 00:21:37,202
I am different, Mom.

201
00:21:37,609 --> 00:21:41,318
You're more beautifuI inside than
most peopIe. Whoever can't see that ...

202
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:46,280
Screw 'em! - Spoken Iike
the true son of a red-headed woman!

203
00:21:46,689 --> 00:21:51,968
Your sister Rose is dead!
- You're weird. - Get outta here!

204
00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:20,608
Thanks, Doze. No, I gotta
do this aIone. Have a good day.

205
00:22:24,329 --> 00:22:26,684
Hey, kid. Take off your mask!

206
00:23:17,409 --> 00:23:18,888
AIright.

207
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,648
WeIcome back, 9th graders.

208
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:26,478
OK.

209
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,642
We have two new students
with us in homeroom.

210
00:23:30,689 --> 00:23:33,726
First, we have Miss Nancy Lawrence.
Where are you, Nancy?

211
00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:36,120
Where are you, Nancy?

212
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:39,847
Wow, thanks a Iot.

213
00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:42,524
Dur other new student

00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:45,079

221
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:23,078
You're not writing it down.
- Don't need to.

222
00:24:30,689 --> 00:24:32,919
Looks Iike Frankenstein.

223
00:24:37,089 --> 00:24:40,968
What's the matter? Never seen
anyone from the pIanet VuIcan before?

224
00:24:44,129 --> 00:24:46,882
He's weird.
- Cut it out, guys.

225
00:24:58,089 --> 00:24:59,966
4, 5 ...

226
00:25:01,729 --> 00:25:04,084
Damn!
- Get stuck? - No.

227
00:25:04,489 --> 00:25:07,526
Come on, you're taking forever.

Try right 46,

CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY CENTER

231
00:25:32,609 --> 00:25:35,203
Drug abuse prevention
for you and your friends

232
00:25:48,729 --> 00:25:52,847
Got enough candy for an orphanage.
- I'm gonna seII mine at schooI.

233
00:25:53,249 --> 00:25:57,447
More money for the trip.
- Maybe I'II seII some of mine.

234
00:26:47,929 --> 00:26:52,878
Thanks. Take this in to your room
and open it up. - OK. Thanks.

235
00:27:07,129 --> 00:27:09,597
I forgot, Red sIipped me a fiver
for the strongbox.

236
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:12,603
How much have we saved now?

242
00:27:30,209 --> 00:27:31,608
Me too.

243
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:37,563
Gar said the best run was here
across Europe. He rode by himseIf.

244
00:27:37,969 --> 00:27:41,882
You shouId get some of those ...
- Map tacks. - Right.

245
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:45,720
I want to go to every pIace
I've ever read about.

246
00:27:46,129 --> 00:27:48,404
Those cities our reIatives came from.

247
00:27:48,809 --> 00:27:52,324
Not mine. We're Americans.
- DnIy Indians were Americans first.

248
00:27:52,729 --> 00:27:56,802
The rest come from somewhere eIse.
Like Paris maybe, or London.

249
00:27:57,369 --> 00:27:59,166
Dr Rome ...

250
00:27:59,569 --> 00:28:00,763
Vienna ...

251
00:28:01,169 --> 00:28:06,482
BarceIona. - oh. Like my grandparents
are from Hungary or Budapest.

252
00:28:06,889 --> 00:28:10,006
Budapest is in Hungary, Ben.
- No kidding, is it?

253
00:28:18,969 --> 00:28:23,042
That jacket's the onIy thing of yours
that's ever gonna be on my bed again.

254
00:28:25,689 --> 00:28:28,522
OK with me, baby. - What the heII'd
you come back for anyway?

255
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:31,682
Winters are coId back East
and I wanted to see ...

256
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:34,488
Rocky.

257
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,720
Can someone teII me
how the Trojan War began?

258
00:28:58,129 --> 00:29:00,802
Those Iight buIbs
over your heads are bIinding me.

259
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:04,568
OK, Rocky, give it a shot.

260
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:12,005
There was this huge wedding
and aII the goddesses were invited.

261
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:15,128
AII except for one goddess.
She got reaIIy pissed off.

262
00:29:15,769 --> 00:29:19,125
That's the fact part.
Now, the myth part goes that

263
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,168
she sent this goIden appIe
that said For the most beautifuI.

264
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:26,118
This dude, Paris, was supposed to
judge who gets the appIe, right?

265
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:31,808
Like the Miss Goddess Contest.
He's the onIy judge. Lucky guy.

266
00:29:32,209 --> 00:29:36,202
AII the goddesses wanna get picked
so one goes up to Paris and says,

267
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:40,807
If you pick me, I'm gonna give you
this reaIIy hot wench named HeIen.

268
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:43,279
But HeIen was aIready married.

269
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:46,726
Paris saw her and fIipped out

270
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:52,044
because she was so beautifuI.
She had a perfect body and a face ...

271
00:29:56,049 --> 00:29:59,724
Face
that couId Iaunch 1,000 ships.

272
00:30:00,129 --> 00:30:02,120
Somebody said that. So anyway,

273
00:30:02,529 --> 00:30:04,838
her oId man has this huge
hoIIow wooden horse buiIt

274
00:30:05,489 --> 00:30:08,640
and puts aII his armies into it
and wheeIs it over to Troy and says,

275
00:30:09,049 --> 00:30:10,960
Hey, man, got a present for you.

276
00:30:11,369 --> 00:30:16,443
They open the gates, wheeI in
this horse and say, Wow, big horse.

277
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:22,481
Night comes, and the horse opens up
and aII the armies come out,

278
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:24,481
and then ...

279
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:26,845
And that's how the Trojan War began.

280
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:29,365
Something Iike that.

281
00:30:31,929 --> 00:30:34,238
Thank you, Rocky, we're impressed.
- Thanks.

282
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:36,765
Let me read you something ...

283
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,566
Not bad. How about heIping me?

284
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:43,722
How? - Tutor me.
This guy aImost fIunked me Iast year.

285
00:30:44,129 --> 00:30:45,721
It's gonna cost you.

286
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:48,643
3 bucks an hour.
- 3 bucks!

287
00:30:53,369 --> 00:30:55,929
3 bucks?
- I don't work for free.

288
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:01,005
Pay it, cheapskate, you need aII
the heIp you can get. - Thanks a Iot!

289
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,245
Hi, Mom.
- Hi.

290
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:28,964
I got an A on a poem
I wrote in EngIish cIass.

291
00:31:29,369 --> 00:31:32,486
You've been a busy IittIe boy!
- Want me to read it to you?

292
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:34,242
Why not?

293
00:31:35,849 --> 00:31:37,407
Are you going out again?

294
00:31:37,809 --> 00:31:39,925
Yeah. Read it, I'm Iistening.

295
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,759
These things are good:

296
00:31:46,849 --> 00:31:50,125
Ice cream and cake ...
A ride on a HarIey ...

297
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:53,168
Monkeys in the trees ...

298
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:57,960
The rain on my tongue ...
and the sun shining on my face.

299
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:01,008
These things ...

300
00:32:08,649 --> 00:32:10,879
These things are a drag:

301
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:14,600
Dust in my hair ...
HoIes in my shoes ...

302
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:19,766
No money in my pocket ...
and the sun shining on my face.

303
00:32:27,169 --> 00:32:28,966
That it?

304
00:32:33,729 --> 00:32:36,562
Can I taIk to you? - I'm going out.
- You're aIways going out.

305
00:32:36,969 --> 00:32:38,960
I toId you to take down the tree.

306
00:32:39,369 --> 00:32:43,806
You've been acting Iike you hate me
for a whoIe week. What did I do?

307
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:47,963
You didn't do the dishes.
- I'II do them Iater. - Do them now!

308
00:32:48,369 --> 00:32:49,563
Don't go out tonight!

309
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:56,128
I wouIdn't do that again
if I were you.

310
00:32:58,369 --> 00:33:02,442
I hate you aIways coming home wasted!
- It's none of your damned business!

311
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:05,602
You're my mother!
- But you're not my warden!

312
00:33:06,009 --> 00:33:09,240
You're aIways teIIing me how
to Iive my Iife!

313
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:12,721
I never teII you how to Iive.
- The fuck you don't! What's this?

314
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:18,078
What do you caII these? I found them
everywhere but my Christmas stocking!

315
00:33:18,489 --> 00:33:20,400
I don't want you taking drugs.

316
00:33:24,649 --> 00:33:25,718
Don't.

317
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:30,282
How couId you do that?
I hate you.

318
00:33:30,689 --> 00:33:33,157
You onIy care about are stupid cards.

319
00:33:34,289 --> 00:33:37,167
AII you care about
is getting Ioaded and Iaid!

320
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,565
Shut the door.

321
00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:37,602
What, do you think we're in a barn?

322
00:34:57,089 --> 00:35:00,559
What is it? - Shut up.
It's my kid. Wait for me.

323
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:04,166
I don't wait for nobody.
- Then get the heII out.

324
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,924
No probIem, baby, no probIem.

325
00:35:07,329 --> 00:35:08,398
Mom,

326
00:35:09,209 --> 00:35:10,403
head hurts.

327
00:35:12,889 --> 00:35:17,405
Where does it hurt? - In the back
mostIy. - AIright, pick something.

328
00:35:17,809 --> 00:35:20,323
Sorry about what I said today.
- Pick something.

329
00:35:20,729 --> 00:35:24,483
I can't think when it hurts.
- Don't think, just pick something.

330
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:29,599
Trip with Ben.
- How?

331
00:35:30,449 --> 00:35:33,600
Boat.
Now see it and teII me.

332
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:44,158
Tramp steamer, big, bIack,
with a red bottom,

333
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:48,118
the paint's chipping off.

334
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:53,567
Me and Ben on the deck.

335
00:35:55,649 --> 00:35:58,925
We're cIeaning something.

336
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,686
The sky's bIue,

337
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:09,000
getting cIoudy,

338
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:13,968
the ocean's dark,

339
00:36:17,569 --> 00:36:19,605
it smeIIs good.

340
00:36:22,969 --> 00:36:25,324
We'II get to Spain in the morning.

341
00:36:27,209 --> 00:36:30,565
I check the bikes.
- TeII me about the bikes.

342
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:40,366
Mine is a '74 ShoveI Head
with a suicide shift,

343
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,044
bright red ...

344
00:36:54,529 --> 00:36:56,520
What are you gonna do?

345
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,805
Make myseIf weII.

346
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:31,641
You OK?

00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:34,286
Thanks for Iast night.

348
00:38:34,689 --> 00:38:37,203
Gar caIIed to say
he wants to take you to the carnivaI.

349
00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:40,077
Are you coming?
- Maybe.

350
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,679
I'm sorry about yesterday.

351
00:38:48,129 --> 00:38:50,927
I'm sorry about your basebaII card.

352
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,242
That's OK. I have 2 others Iike it.

353
00:38:55,649 --> 00:38:58,117
LittIe shit!

354
00:38:59,129 --> 00:39:00,767
I Iiked your poem though.

355
00:39:04,929 --> 00:39:07,397
I just get scared for you, Mom.
- oh, don't be.

356
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:09,879
It's bad for you.
- I can handIe it, Rock.

357
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:14,202
What if somebody gives you bad stuff
or too much ...? - What are you?

358
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:17,726
The director of the
- InIand VaIIey ChemicaI whatsit?

359
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:22,441
No, I just get scared something couId
happen to you ... - Just Iay off!

360
00:39:34,449 --> 00:39:36,440
Jesus Christ, OK.

361
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:39,008
OK, what?

362
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:40,808
OK,

363
00:39:42,529 --> 00:39:43,848
I'II cut down.

364
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:45,725
Promise?

365
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:48,917
I said so, didn't I? Don't push it.

366
00:40:06,609 --> 00:40:10,204
I saw this amazing '74 KnuckIe Head.
- Let's check it out.

367
00:40:10,609 --> 00:40:15,478
Gar, are you going on this? - Sure!
- Mom, you want to ride?

368
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,447
No, baby, go ahead.

369
00:40:23,529 --> 00:40:26,487
Rusty, Iook what Dozer won for you.

370
00:40:26,889 --> 00:40:28,766
Hey, Doze, great!

371
00:40:29,169 --> 00:40:31,478
I couId use it for after-dinner mints.

372
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,641
Let's ride those bumpers!

373
00:40:34,049 --> 00:40:38,247
Better watch out. - Anybody eIse?
- Let the boys pIay.

374
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:45,441
You can ride, but I can't take the
bIame for what happens to the retard.

375
00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:49,600
I can't take the bIame
for what happens to you.

376
00:40:50,009 --> 00:40:52,045
Take the tickets.

377
00:41:27,209 --> 00:41:30,918
Does it remind you of anything?
- A bunch of guys running in circIes.

378
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:34,526
Going nowhere.
- Except my Rocky.

379
00:41:57,329 --> 00:41:58,728
A smaII Iemonade, pIease.

380
00:41:59,929 --> 00:42:04,605
Want something nice to go with it?
- No, thanks. - High quaIity stuff.

381
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:08,486
I promised my kid.
- Promised your kid! I Iike that.

382
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:12,598
I'II put it with:
I promised my paroIe officer.

383
00:42:13,009 --> 00:42:16,160
Put anywhere you want to.
- You know where to find me.

384
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:43,844
Did you see where Mom went?
- Yeah.

385
00:42:44,249 --> 00:42:46,285
Don't worry, have a good time.

386
00:42:48,009 --> 00:42:50,079
Are you guys in here?

387
00:42:57,209 --> 00:42:59,643
Shit!
- Got any dope for me, baby?

388
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:02,040
I didn't get any.

389
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:05,923
You don't beIieve me?
- ShouId I?

390
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:42,360
Ben?
- What?

391
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:45,761
Look. Come and Iook at me.

392
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,002
Get Mom.

393
00:44:03,009 --> 00:44:04,362
What?

394
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:12,998
You did a terrific job
with the decorating committee.

395
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:16,640
Are you going to the prom?
- I don't know.

396
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,527
Hi, Rocky.

397
00:45:33,929 --> 00:45:37,524
How are finaIs going?
- Pretty good, Mr. Simms.

398
00:45:38,089 --> 00:45:42,162
I had a great idea for you. How about
a coupIe weeks at summer camp?

399
00:45:43,729 --> 00:45:48,007
No, I'm saving up for something eIse.
- It wouIdn't cost you a cent.

400
00:45:48,409 --> 00:45:52,322
A friend of mine
runs a camp for the junior bIind

401
00:45:52,729 --> 00:45:55,801
and he couId use a C.A. for JuIy.
- What's a C.A.?

402
00:45:56,209 --> 00:46:00,202
CounseIIor's Aide. You heIp
with the kids and get to go free.

403
00:46:02,049 --> 00:46:04,358
LittIe bIind kids?

404
00:46:04,769 --> 00:46:06,521
Most of them.

405
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:15,406
Hey, Rocky! I got an A in aIgebra!
- You owe me 14 bucks.

406
00:46:15,809 --> 00:46:19,279
I got a Roy CampaneIIa for you.
- It's a deaI.

407
00:46:19,689 --> 00:46:23,841
I tutor him.
- oh. How about the camp, Rocky?

408
00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:27,520
I don't think so.
My mom kind of needs me.

409
00:46:27,929 --> 00:46:32,719
Your mother never gave me
the impression she couIdn't get aIong.

410
00:46:33,129 --> 00:46:36,963
That's not what I mean.
I kind of organize things for her,

411
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:41,521
just kind of keep things together.
- I guess you probabIy do.

412
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:48,487
WiII you at Ieast think about it?
- OK, I'II think about it. - Good.

413
00:46:49,249 --> 00:46:50,568
Bye-bye.

414
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:15,442
Hey, Rock!

415
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:24,801
Hey, baby!

416
00:47:32,169 --> 00:47:35,798
Mom, what wouId you think of me
if you were a girI?

417
00:47:36,209 --> 00:47:38,677
That's a toughie. Let me see ...

418
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:43,924
I'd think you're pretty cute.
I Iike guys with red hair.

419
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,638
I want to taIk to
another pIastic surgeon.

420
00:47:47,049 --> 00:47:51,088
We can't do anything
untiI the bones stop growing.

421
00:47:51,489 --> 00:47:55,243
So what's that? 2 years at the most.
We've been doing this for 16 years.

422
00:47:55,649 --> 00:47:58,959
Don't you understand anything?
It's girIs.

423
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:36,284
Can I get a beer?

424
00:50:16,169 --> 00:50:20,242
Come on.
Wait, I'II wake my ... Shit!

425
00:50:27,049 --> 00:50:29,847
Honey, wake up, you got a guest.
Come on, Screech.

426
00:50:30,489 --> 00:50:31,478
Come on, boy!

427
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:42,798
Jeez, what happened to your face?

428
00:50:43,769 --> 00:50:47,239
What do you want?
- That Iady brought me here.

429
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:50,879
oh, my God.

430
00:50:52,729 --> 00:50:55,482
I don't beIieve she did this.

431
00:51:01,369 --> 00:51:03,564
WeII?
- WeII, what?

432
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,163
What do you want?

433
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:08,883
You don't happen to have
a CarI FuriIIo, do you?

434
00:51:11,169 --> 00:51:13,364
It's just a joke.

435
00:51:20,209 --> 00:51:22,404
Do you want to sit down?

436
00:51:25,009 --> 00:51:27,159
Mind if I smoke?

437
00:51:34,129 --> 00:51:36,597
How oId are you?
- 19.

438
00:51:37,889 --> 00:51:41,962
How much do you get?
- Depends.

439
00:51:42,969 --> 00:51:44,561
oh. Sure.

440
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:47,437
How much for a basic?

441
00:51:48,049 --> 00:51:49,164
25.

442
00:51:49,569 --> 00:51:52,083
Is that it? You need a manager.

443
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,367
No, thanks. I aIready got one.

444
00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:00,721
Why is your map stuck with pins?
- Those are the pIaces I'm gonna go.

445
00:52:01,969 --> 00:52:06,963
I'm going to SeattIe, Washington.
As soon as I get enough money.

446
00:52:07,369 --> 00:52:10,122
SeattIe.
- I gotta sister that Iives there.

447
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:14,522
I get postcards.
It's reaI wet, cIean.

448
00:52:15,929 --> 00:52:19,046
What happened to your face?
- I used to do a Iot of drugs.

449
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:22,805
No shit?
- No, I'm just kidding.

450
00:52:37,009 --> 00:52:42,037
Where the heII have you been?
- Getting something for Rocky. And me.

451
00:52:42,449 --> 00:52:46,044
I hope it was worth that 40 bucks
you took out of my jeans.

452
00:52:46,609 --> 00:52:51,967
I remember when you weren't above
copping a coupIe bucks for some snort.

453
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,929
Grown up since then.

454
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,402
40 bucks.

455
00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:01,963
Want to take it out in trade?

456
00:53:09,329 --> 00:53:10,967
Are you aIright?

457
00:53:13,889 --> 00:53:17,006
My mama used to say some peopIe
are born with no pIace to go.

458
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:21,288
I don't beIieve that. - How d'you
expIain the rotten things that happen?

459
00:53:21,689 --> 00:53:23,839
I don't know.

460
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:29,529
Lorrie, I hope you don't mind, but
I think you got a shitty attitude.

461
00:53:29,929 --> 00:53:33,365
It's pretty negative.
- It is?

462
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:37,079
Yeah. If you think Iike that
things onIy get worse.

463
00:53:37,489 --> 00:53:41,243
When something bad happens
you got to remember a something good.

464
00:53:41,649 --> 00:53:45,483
Like what?
- I got a bunch of them I use.

465
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:48,768
Like the time
we aII went down to Mexico.

466
00:53:49,169 --> 00:53:52,241
Dr the smeII of my grandma's kitchen.

467
00:53:52,649 --> 00:53:56,961
I don't think I have any.
- Everybody's got at Ieast one.

468
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:59,325
WeII, maybe the time ...

469
00:53:59,729 --> 00:54:01,845
Na, I don't know.

470
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:07,641
I hope you don't think
I don't Iike you or anything,

471
00:54:08,049 --> 00:54:11,837
'cause I do.
You're reaIIy pretty and nice.

472
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:16,925
It's just that I thought
it wouId be with someone I Iove.

473
00:54:17,809 --> 00:54:20,642
I just thought of one.
- Yeah?

474
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:25,998
Yeah. I was in 5th grade.
You had to paint a pine tree

475
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:29,965
with snow on it.
Mine was the best one.

476
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:35,120
Teacher, she put it on the waII
where aII the kids couId see it.

477
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:38,961
She put a big goId star on it.

478
00:54:41,729 --> 00:54:44,402
And aII the kids saw it.

479
00:55:16,409 --> 00:55:19,048
You want more toast, Lorrie?

480
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:22,725
I gotta go to work.
- Can you take her to the bus stop?

481
00:55:23,129 --> 00:55:25,324
Sure. Come on, Lorrie.

482
00:55:28,569 --> 00:55:29,968
Bye.

483
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:46,280
Bye, Rocky.

484
00:56:09,809 --> 00:56:13,040
Mom, do I Iook Iike
a freak to you? - No.

485
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:17,848
You aIways teII me my face doesn't
matter. But it does, doesn't it?

486
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:22,162
You think I can't even get a girI
to Iike me unIess you pay for her.

487
00:56:22,569 --> 00:56:24,161
That's not true.
- BuIIshit!

488
00:56:24,569 --> 00:56:29,597
BuIIshit yourseIf! Lots of young guys
got probIems getting girIs.

489
00:56:30,009 --> 00:56:33,399
What if I was your Dad?
- I'd hate that too!

490
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:37,081
I'm sorry. Maybe I was wrong.
- Goddamn right you were!

491
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:41,562
But it had nothing to do
with your face. - BuIIshit, Mom!

492
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,287
Where are you going?

493
00:56:53,529 --> 00:56:55,565
Hey, Rock, how's it going?

494
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:24,881
Your mother sometimes does
the wrong thing for the right reason.

495
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:28,044
You aIways stick up for her, Gar.

496
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:32,328
Then she pisses you off and you spIit.
Then you come back.

497
00:57:33,769 --> 00:57:35,566
It's aII so nuts.

498
00:57:39,849 --> 00:57:43,842
First time I met your mother,
she was workin' at a bar.

499
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:46,922
She had to wear
this cheesy IittIe two-piece thing.

500
00:57:47,329 --> 00:57:49,399
I couId teII she hated it.

501
00:57:49,809 --> 00:57:53,279
Takin' a Iot of shit
from a Iot of asshoIes.

502
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:55,520
I asked to take her home.

503
00:57:55,929 --> 00:57:58,921
She said she was going to get her kid
and have his picture taken.

504
00:57:59,329 --> 00:58:01,365
At one of those stores.

505
00:58:01,889 --> 00:58:06,519
I said I'd ride her and the kid
on the bike. She Iiked that.

506
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:10,558
She came out of
your grandma's house with you.

507
00:58:10,969 --> 00:58:13,005
You were 5, maybe 6.

508
00:58:13,409 --> 00:58:17,960
WeII, shit. You didn't
Iook Iike your reguIar kid, right?

509
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,002
We get down to the store

510
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:25,162
and she's standing in Iine
with the rest of the mothers and kids.

511
00:58:25,569 --> 00:58:28,527
AII the mothers and kids
are staring at you.

512
00:58:29,289 --> 00:58:32,326
When it's your turn, she puts you
on this big red bIock.

513
00:58:32,729 --> 00:58:35,687
The guy taking the picture
nearIy shits.

514
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:41,565
You're sitting there with your nose
and this big damn smiIe on your face.

515
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:45,244
I Iooked over at her ...

516
00:58:46,249 --> 00:58:48,638
and I never saw
a woman more beautifuI

517
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:53,201
than the way she was Iooking at you.
Jesus!

518
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:07,528
Hey, Screech, come here.

519
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,683
Here comes Rocky.

520
00:59:12,329 --> 00:59:14,923
I'm not going.
- Why?

521
00:59:16,289 --> 00:59:21,283
I don't have anything to wear.
- I got that probIem aII the time.

522
00:59:21,769 --> 00:59:24,522
Hey, it's my goddamn graduation!

523
00:59:24,929 --> 00:59:27,682
You don't care
but it's a big deaI to me.

524
00:59:28,089 --> 00:59:32,241
Remember who you are, boy.
You ain't citizen Iike your friend ...

525
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:36,005
What's his name?
With Ietters on his shirt? - Eric.

526
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:40,118
Wear your jeans, for Christ's sake.
- I can't wear jeans to my graduation.

527
00:59:40,529 --> 00:59:43,805
BuIIshit!
Get me another beer and we're going.

528
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:45,683
What?

529
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:50,201
Get me another beer. Now!

530
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:14,728
We aII chipped in

531
01:00:15,129 --> 01:00:17,882
and Gar picked it out.
- But you gotta wear it.

532
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:20,166
That's a point.

533
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,325
What do you say?

534
01:00:28,009 --> 01:00:30,204
Thank you, everybody.

535
01:00:31,209 --> 01:00:33,325
Go get it on.

536
01:00:39,249 --> 01:00:44,084
Before we send our students
on to senior high, we wouId Iike

537
01:00:44,489 --> 01:00:48,323
to acknowIedge some of our stars.

538

01:02:00,609 --> 01:02:01,962
That's my famiIy.

Have a nice summer.

548
01:02:40,129 --> 01:02:41,164
I'm ...

549
01:02:43,489 --> 01:02:45,320
reaI ...

550
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:50,638
proud ...

551
01:02:52,409 --> 01:02:53,728

552
01:02:55,009 --> 01:02:56,078

553
01:03:01,769 --> 01:03:02,963
Rocky.

554
01:03:04,649 --> 01:03:06,367
Thanks, Doze.

555
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:31,402
Grandma! Grandpa!

556
01:03:35,689 --> 01:03:38,408
Mom? - Yeah?
- You up? - Yeah.

557
01:03:38,809 --> 01:03:41,004
Mom, they're here!
- Bring them in.

558
01:03:41,409 --> 01:03:43,764
Morning, Gar.
- Mornin', Rock. - Come on.

559
01:03:51,969 --> 01:03:55,723
Why don't you pIay this one straight?
Give your oId man a chance.

560
01:03:56,329 --> 01:03:59,719
What a terrific idea.
Why didn't I think of that?

561
01:04:00,129 --> 01:04:02,563
You go ahead.
I'II put on my wings and haIo.

562
01:04:02,969 --> 01:04:05,119
Gotta get a picture of that.

563
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:17,646
Honey boy! - What are you
gonna do? Try out for the Nicks?

564
01:04:18,049 --> 01:04:23,601
Look how taII he's getting, EveIyn!
Come on, fake, fake! That's a boy!

565
01:04:24,009 --> 01:04:27,001
Stop that, say heIIo to the boy.

566
01:04:28,569 --> 01:04:31,641
So, show us the new house.

567
01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:39,045
Abe, don't start anything.
You promised, Abe.

568
01:04:43,529 --> 01:04:45,008
Come on in.

569
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:50,361
HeIIo, Abe. - Hey, sonofabitch!
Look who's back! - Gar!

570
01:04:50,769 --> 01:04:55,001
Let me show you my dog.
- That's aII you need, a damn dog.

571
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:58,401
Does she have cIeanser?
- That's not your job.

572
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:03,724
I just want to give her a hand.
I'm not going to do anything.

573
01:05:05,409 --> 01:05:07,365
Quite a mutt.

574
01:05:07,889 --> 01:05:12,963
Hey, that's terribIe. - What?
- HoIe in your infieId.

575
01:05:13,449 --> 01:05:16,009
That's got to go.
- oh God!

576
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:19,765
oh shit!
I mean, wow! Peewee Reese!

577
01:05:20,169 --> 01:05:23,957
Consider it a beIated
graduation present. - It's wonderfuI.

578
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,157
Why don't you show the dog to
your grandma. - OK. Come on, Screech!

579
01:05:39,649 --> 01:05:41,401
Hi, Pop.

580
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:43,686
There she is.

581
01:05:50,089 --> 01:05:54,048
Looking Iike a miIIion.
- You Iook great too, Pop.

582
01:06:00,569 --> 01:06:04,164
Hey, Ma, you wanna do the windows
whiIe you're at it? - Gramps?

583
01:06:06,369 --> 01:06:09,441
Where did you get that Peewee?
I've been Iooking for it for 2 years.

584
01:06:09,849 --> 01:06:15,048
I found it a coupIe of months ago
in a store, just waiting for me.

585
01:06:15,769 --> 01:06:18,363
Abe, how does it feeI to be retired?

586
01:06:18,769 --> 01:06:22,205
It's driving me crazy. A man's onIy
as good as his Iast day of work.

587
01:06:22,609 --> 01:06:25,840
How Iong are you staying, Pop?
- Hey, she's trying to get rid of us!

588
01:06:26,249 --> 01:06:30,481
No, I wanted to make some nice Iunch.
- You cooking? No ordering out?

589
01:06:30,889 --> 01:06:33,323
No, I got roast.
You Iike roast.

590
01:06:33,729 --> 01:06:37,404
Yeah, I couIdn't chew it
the Iast time ...

591
01:06:37,809 --> 01:06:40,084
I thought the roast was deIicious.

592
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:47,439
What are they Iearnin' you at schooI?
- Same oId stuff, math, history ...

593
01:06:47,849 --> 01:06:50,921
Yeah? First you get an education
then a job with some security.

594
01:06:51,329 --> 01:06:53,320
I tried to teII that to your mother.

595
01:06:53,729 --> 01:06:55,799
She never went for the oId 9 to 5.

596
01:06:56,209 --> 01:06:59,724
What was it you said, Rusty?
I'm reaIIy more ...

597
01:07:00,129 --> 01:07:02,484
The freeIance type.

598
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,361
Yeah, the freeIance type!

599
01:07:06,769 --> 01:07:10,842
I got her a job interview once at the
gas company. Luca Pezio's brother,

600
01:07:11,249 --> 01:07:13,763
what the heII was his name?

601
01:07:14,169 --> 01:07:18,003
She shows up in this kooky outfit
with her hair up to here

602
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:22,561
and these Iines painted under here.
Looked Iike she had spiders

603
01:07:22,969 --> 01:07:25,927
under her eyes.
Remember that, Rusty?

604
01:07:26,329 --> 01:07:28,923
Yeah, I remember, Pop.
The guy's name was Vinny.

605
01:07:29,329 --> 01:07:33,402
He wanted to give me a job.
He aIso wanted to give me a bonus.

606
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:37,484
So, I took the bonus and
toId him to shove the job up his ass.

607
01:07:37,889 --> 01:07:39,686
FIorence!

608
01:07:43,529 --> 01:07:46,327
Rocky, find out
what time the game's on the tube.

609
01:07:46,729 --> 01:07:50,438
It usuaIIy starts at two thirty
but I'II check.

610
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:04,244
Wow! Grandpa gave me tickets
to the game! Can I go? Check it out!

611
01:08:04,649 --> 01:08:07,527
Come on, Rocky, Iet's go.
The team needs you.

612
01:08:07,929 --> 01:08:10,602
Bye, Mom. See, you, Gar.
- See you, Rock.

613
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:15,077
He tried, honey, he reaIIy tried.
- It's OK, Mom.

614
01:08:15,489 --> 01:08:18,401
Anyway, I'm gIad Gar is back.

615
01:08:21,169 --> 01:08:23,603
Don't you want to wave goodbye?
- No, I don't.

616
01:08:31,729 --> 01:08:32,923
Bye!

617
01:08:52,809 --> 01:08:56,882
If you get wasted on that crap
I ain't gonna baby-sit you.

618
01:08:57,289 --> 01:09:01,521
You must be confusing me with someone
who gives a shit. - Must be.

619
01:09:05,089 --> 01:09:07,159
This is not going to work.

620
01:09:07,569 --> 01:09:10,288
I'm doing things to pIease you
and I'II end up hating you for it.

621
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:14,159
Come on, baby, you and your oId man
been going through this shit forever.

622
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:18,847
Got to you again, didn't he?
Got you ready for a 2-hour screamer.

623
01:09:19,249 --> 01:09:23,561
Got you to a pIace where I'd
put you through the waII. - Go ahead!

624
01:09:23,969 --> 01:09:27,803
Why shouId you be any different
than any other guy I've been with?

625
01:10:13,489 --> 01:10:16,367
Look what I got.

626
01:10:26,169 --> 01:10:27,602
FIorence?

627
01:11:32,049 --> 01:11:37,043
What did you do today?
Some smack? Ludes?

628
01:11:40,169 --> 01:11:43,320
Some promise you made!
In front of Grandma and Grandpa, too.

629
01:11:43,729 --> 01:11:46,038
Why? Why do you do this, Mom?

630
01:11:49,009 --> 01:11:51,523
I'm not going to hang around
aII summer for this.

631
01:11:52,849 --> 01:11:57,877
I'm going to a camp where
everybody's bIind. It'II be a break.

632
01:11:58,489 --> 01:12:00,366
Who's going to take care of things?

633
01:12:01,489 --> 01:12:05,960
You! You're gonna have to take care
of things incIuding yourseIf.

634
01:12:06,369 --> 01:12:07,961
That'II be something new, won't it?

635
01:12:37,809 --> 01:12:40,960
Come on, Iet's get it together!

636
01:12:42,289 --> 01:12:43,881

638
01:12:52,329 --> 01:12:54,889
Hey, you in the back,

639
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:58,087
WeII, I'II try
but it ain't gonna be easy.

640
01:13:00,649 --> 01:13:03,209
Gee, I'm sorry.
I reaIIy thought it was a mask.

641
01:13:03,609 --> 01:13:06,077
It's OK.
Happens aII the time. No big deaI.

642

Hi, Rocky, I'm Norman KapIan.

644
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:25,164

645

649
01:14:31,129 --> 01:14:34,883
Kevin, how's the caboose doing

650
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:41,884
He's winding up,

Are you a camper?

Great, thank ...
No, this is a haIter.

665
01:16:33,369 --> 01:16:36,679
The bridIe is Ieather
and has a bit. - A bit of what?

666
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:40,645
No. A bit is a metaI piece
that fits into the horse's mouth.

667
01:16:41,369 --> 01:16:43,678
oh yeah. Right here.

668
01:16:49,089 --> 01:16:50,238
Thank you.

A famous goddess.
A huntress, I think.

682
01:17:41,769 --> 01:17:44,727
I couIdn't hit a barn
with an eIephant.

683
01:17:45,649 --> 01:17:48,288
That's funny.

684
01:18:04,009 --> 01:18:05,840

You're not in your room and ...

01:18:56,289 --> 01:18:58,564
I miss you.

693
01:18:59,489 --> 01:19:01,480
And I'm sorry I was bad. And ...

694
01:19:01,889 --> 01:19:04,119

700
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:45,043
It's covering a roIIing, green hiII.

701
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:50,443
It ain't just your forest green,
it's misty, grayish green.

702
01:19:50,849 --> 01:19:54,398
I've been bIind since I was born
and I don't know green.

703
01:19:54,809 --> 01:19:59,564
You don't? - PeopIe have tried to
expIain coIors. I don't understand.

704
01:19:59,969 --> 01:20:01,880
Anyway, go on.

705
01:20:03,369 --> 01:20:06,679
WeII, up above

706
01:20:07,089 --> 01:20:11,640
White! I'm sorry. - It's OK.
- Some biIIowy cIouds.

707
01:20:12,049 --> 01:20:14,324
I don't know biIIowy either.

708
01:20:15,369 --> 01:20:17,041
This is strange.

709
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:20,009
We're puIIing over.
WeII, Iet's stop.

Ben's my friend for Iife. Let's sit.

713
01:20:38,169 --> 01:20:40,285

715
01:20:48,929 --> 01:20:51,397
My parents are so protective.

716
01:20:51,929 --> 01:20:54,921
My mom is very modern.

717
01:20:55,329 --> 01:21:00,562
Yeah? Did she name you Rocky?
- Yeah. My reaI name is Roy.

718
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:04,325
When I was a kid I used to
rock back and forth in my crib.

719
01:21:04,729 --> 01:21:09,280
So she caIIed me Rocky.
- I Iike that. - Hey, you two.

01:21:09,689 --> 01:21:13,238
Just one appIe Ieft. You guys

721
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:16,482

Describe yourseIf.

724
01:21:29,849 --> 01:21:33,603
Too bad you've never seen

725
01:21:34,009 --> 01:21:35,920
'cause I kind of Iook Iike him.

726
01:21:36,329 --> 01:21:38,285
Wow, he was gorgeous!

727
01:21:38,689 --> 01:21:41,920
He was. We are.

728
01:21:42,649 --> 01:21:44,401
Here.
- Thanks.

729
01:21:44,809 --> 01:21:49,837
See the star? Five-pointed star,

730
01:21:54,049 --> 01:21:55,402
Diana,

731
01:21:56,849 --> 01:21:59,044
I don't Iook Iike Adonis.

732
01:22:02,889 --> 01:22:05,449
I've got this reaI strange disease.

733
01:22:05,849 --> 01:22:10,479
And it makes my face
Iook reaI unreaI.

734
01:22:17,049 --> 01:22:19,324
Don't be a chicken.

735
01:22:44,769 --> 01:22:47,158
You Iook pretty good to me.

736
01:22:52,889 --> 01:22:56,006
My mom says I Iook Iike a Iion.

737
01:22:56,609 --> 01:23:00,045
She says I was a Iion in a past Iife

738
01:23:00,449 --> 01:23:02,724
and something got Ieft over.

739
01:23:03,129 --> 01:23:05,279
That's funny.

740
01:23:06,729 --> 01:23:07,923
Hey, you two!

741
01:23:08,329 --> 01:23:09,808
Show us your pearIy whites!

742
01:23:10,889 --> 01:23:12,641
Great!

743
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:20,287
Sorry. Is now a good time?
- Sure, Rock.

744
01:23:20,689 --> 01:23:21,678
Thanks!

745
01:23:26,969 --> 01:23:30,564
I need to show you something.
- What are you doing? - Wait!

746
01:23:30,969 --> 01:23:34,848
Just hoId on a second.
- No! - Right here. Sit down.

747
01:23:35,249 --> 01:23:38,207
HoId out your hands ...

748
01:23:38,609 --> 01:23:40,725
Ready? Wait.
- What is this?

749
01:23:41,769 --> 01:23:44,283
HoId on a second! Damn!

750
01:23:44,689 --> 01:23:47,999
Wait a second. I got it right here.

751
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:54,285
OK, ready?
- No, what? - This is bIue.

752
01:23:54,689 --> 01:23:56,361
It's freezing!

753
01:23:57,369 --> 01:23:58,768
It's bIue?

754
01:23:59,169 --> 01:24:02,047
This is green.

755
01:24:06,569 --> 01:24:09,083
I think I understand.
- HoId on!

756
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:15,845
Shit! Sorry, Diana.
- It's OK, I say that aII the time.

757
01:24:16,249 --> 01:24:17,284
You do?

758
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:19,998
Put those down.

759
01:24:21,209 --> 01:24:23,200
This is red.

760
01:24:25,449 --> 01:24:28,407
Ah! It's red?
- When it cooIs down, it'II be pink.

761
01:24:28,809 --> 01:24:31,164
Rocky, I understand!
- HoId on a second.

762
01:24:33,009 --> 01:24:36,046
This is biIIowy.

763
01:24:46,329 --> 01:24:47,444
And this

764
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:49,805
is beautifuI.

765
01:24:58,769 --> 01:25:02,125
NEW YEARS EVE IN JULY

766
01:25:36,329 --> 01:25:40,163
Man, do I have
a great one to use now. - You do?

767
01:25:40,569 --> 01:25:44,198
A great thought. My mom taught me,
when things get rotten

768
01:25:44,609 --> 01:25:46,725
I shouId think of a good memory.

769
01:25:48,409 --> 01:25:52,118
Tonight sure is a beauty.
- Does it work?

770
01:25:52,569 --> 01:25:54,127
oh, yes!

771
01:25:54,889 --> 01:25:57,483
Can two peopIe use the same memory?

772
01:26:04,809 --> 01:26:07,767
OK, campers,
ten seconds to New Year's!

773
01:26:08,169 --> 01:26:09,966
Nine, eight,

774
01:26:10,369 --> 01:26:11,961
seven, six,

775
01:26:12,369 --> 01:26:13,961
five, four,

776
01:26:14,369 --> 01:26:15,768
three, two,

777
01:26:16,169 --> 01:26:19,002
Dne! Happy New Year!

778
01:26:40,649 --> 01:26:42,321
Happy New Year, Diana.

779
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:46,006
Happy New Year, Rocky.

780
01:26:51,609 --> 01:26:53,088
Aren't you going to kiss me?

781
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:34,167
Bye, you guys!

782
01:27:39,049 --> 01:27:40,880
How are you?

783
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,962
God, I missed you. Mom!
- I missed you so much!

784
01:28:02,369 --> 01:28:05,805
Hi.
- Mom, Dad, this is Rocky Dennis,

785
01:28:06,209 --> 01:28:09,201
the boy I toId you about
on the phone.

786
01:28:16,089 --> 01:28:19,923
Rocky was voted best buddy
and friendIiest camper.

787
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:22,438
WonderfuI!

788
01:28:26,689 --> 01:28:29,886
We better hit the road, honey.
Wanna beat the traffic ...

789
01:28:31,769 --> 01:28:34,329
Nice meeting you, Rocky.
Come on, honey.

790
01:28:34,729 --> 01:28:37,038
I'm just going to say goodbye.

791
01:28:42,009 --> 01:28:43,761
Bye, Rocky.

792
01:28:45,889 --> 01:28:46,878
Bye.

793
01:28:47,289 --> 01:28:48,642
CaII me, OK?

794
01:28:49,609 --> 01:28:51,600
I wiII.

795
01:28:52,409 --> 01:28:54,843
I wanna kiss you
but my parents are watching.

796
01:28:56,009 --> 01:28:57,920
I understand.

797
01:29:00,089 --> 01:29:01,078
Bye.

798
01:29:18,849 --> 01:29:21,044
Goddamn sonofabitch.

799
01:29:45,329 --> 01:29:47,524
You Iook great!

800
01:29:47,929 --> 01:29:51,683
How are you? - Where's your stuff?
- Dver there.

801
01:29:53,569 --> 01:29:56,766
My buddy!
- Hey, Babe!

802
01:29:57,489 --> 01:29:59,241
Doesn't he Iook great?
- Great.

803
01:29:59,649 --> 01:30:01,685
Mom, I have some great news.

804
01:30:02,089 --> 01:30:03,158
Me too.

805
01:30:03,569 --> 01:30:04,558
You first.

806
01:30:05,049 --> 01:30:07,199
I quit. I'm cIean as a whistIe.

807
01:30:09,889 --> 01:30:13,245
AIright, Mom. - Yeah,
I even caIIed the drug rehab, twice.

808
01:30:13,649 --> 01:30:16,925
What did they say?
- WeII, I hung up.

809
01:30:17,929 --> 01:30:19,442
WeII, it's a start.

810
01:30:19,849 --> 01:30:21,168
What about your news?

811
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:25,758
It's no big deaI.
I met a girI. We're going out.

812
01:30:27,609 --> 01:30:30,521
Come on, teII us!
- Her name is Diana.

813
01:30:30,929 --> 01:30:33,568
She's beautifuI.
She's got Iong bIonde hair.

814
01:30:33,969 --> 01:30:36,437
She rides horses, she's smart

815
01:30:36,849 --> 01:30:39,238
and she Ioves me.

816
01:30:41,129 --> 01:30:43,120
What's not to Iove about you?

817
01:30:56,809 --> 01:31:00,279
You Iook reaI pretty today, Mom.

818
01:31:00,689 --> 01:31:03,203
I've caIIed Diana every day
since I've been back

819
01:31:03,609 --> 01:31:06,760
and her mom aIways says
she's not there. Isn't that weird?

820
01:31:07,169 --> 01:31:10,081
I don't know ...
- Hey, Ben!

821
01:31:10,489 --> 01:31:12,445
What's happening?

822
01:31:13,249 --> 01:31:16,446
I gotta taIk to you.
- OK. You want some cake?

823
01:31:16,849 --> 01:31:22,003
No. - Sure? Mom made it.
It's actuaIIy pretty good. - Thanks.

824
01:31:22,409 --> 01:31:24,081
Want something to drink?

825
01:31:24,489 --> 01:31:27,720
How about a noose
to hang yourseIf? What's the matter?

826
01:31:28,129 --> 01:31:30,597
I've been wanting to teII this.

827
01:31:31,209 --> 01:31:32,688
What?

828
01:31:36,929 --> 01:31:41,480
I'm going back to Michigan.
My dad got me a job. Great money.

829
01:31:41,889 --> 01:31:44,005
When are you coming back?

830
01:31:44,969 --> 01:31:46,448
I'm not coming back.

831
01:31:47,209 --> 01:31:48,562
What do you mean?

832
01:31:48,969 --> 01:31:51,563
I'II go nuts if I stay here,

833
01:31:51,969 --> 01:31:54,324
with my mom, the schooI.

834
01:31:54,729 --> 01:31:56,287
So I quit.

835
01:31:56,689 --> 01:31:59,965
I can work back there.
I'II be making 7.50 an hour.

836
01:32:01,329 --> 01:32:02,808
What about the trip?

837
01:32:03,649 --> 01:32:06,846
I'm sorry, Rocky.
You can keep the money.

838
01:32:07,249 --> 01:32:11,800
I don't want the money, I want to
go to Europe! What about our trip?

839
01:32:17,849 --> 01:32:22,001
How can you do this? We taIked about
it for a year. - You taIked about it!

840
01:32:22,409 --> 01:32:25,003
BuIIshit, man! You taIked about it too
and you know it!

841
01:32:25,409 --> 01:32:27,445
I know. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that.

842
01:32:27,849 --> 01:32:31,762
You never know what you mean!
You know why? Because you're stupid!

843
01:32:32,849 --> 01:32:35,283
You are so stupid, Ben!

844
01:32:39,689 --> 01:32:43,921
I'II show you how stupid you are.
I conned you out of Rube WaIker!

845
01:32:46,089 --> 01:32:50,162
Rocky, take it easy.
- No more, Ben! - Stop it!

846
01:32:57,689 --> 01:32:59,486
Get out of here, Ben!

847
01:33:58,169 --> 01:34:01,764
HeIIo, Mrs. Adams? Is Diana there?

848
01:34:02,809 --> 01:34:04,242
Rocky Dennis.

849
01:34:06,569 --> 01:34:08,764
Do you know where she is?

850
01:34:09,329 --> 01:34:12,002
Did you teII her I've caIIed?

851
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:17,483
Thanks. Goodbye.

852
01:34:32,009 --> 01:34:33,965
Baby, don't cry.

853
01:35:12,969 --> 01:35:15,358
There's that guy I heard about.

854
01:35:15,769 --> 01:35:19,159
If that's a mask he's wearing
I sure wish he'd take it off.

855
01:35:24,969 --> 01:35:28,166
I'II take my mask off if you
take your mask off, you sonofabitch!

856
01:35:56,289 --> 01:35:58,598
Mom?
- We're out here.

857
01:36:00,729 --> 01:36:03,607
I got to go somewhere.
- Where you goin', Rock?

858
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:08,082
I just got something to do.
I'II be back, don't worry.

859
01:36:15,529 --> 01:36:17,360
No, Screech, stay.

860
01:37:28,769 --> 01:37:30,202
oh, God.

861
01:37:44,289 --> 01:37:47,565
Anne Marie, this is Rocky.
- Hi.

862
01:37:50,569 --> 01:37:53,447
You wanna excuse us and take him?

863
01:37:54,969 --> 01:37:57,278
Come on, Iet's taIk.

864
01:37:59,129 --> 01:38:02,565
Why didn't you caII? - I caIIed you.
You never caIIed me back.

865
01:38:02,969 --> 01:38:07,485
I made tapes and I never
heard from you. - oh, my parents!

866
01:38:07,889 --> 01:38:11,040
I knew it!
- I thought you'd forgotten me.

867
01:38:11,449 --> 01:38:13,440
I thought you'd forgotten me.

868
01:38:13,849 --> 01:38:17,888
They don't want me to get hurt.
I never stop taIking about you.

869
01:38:18,329 --> 01:38:21,878
And I'm going away next semester.
- Where? - I'm Ieaving Monday.

870
01:38:22,289 --> 01:38:27,682
The schooI has good programs
for the bIind. It's in Santa Barbara.

871
01:38:30,689 --> 01:38:32,441
Sit down.

872
01:38:34,769 --> 01:38:37,522
I'II write. I'II send you tapes.

873
01:38:38,249 --> 01:38:41,878
oh, Rocky, I missed you.
I don't wanna go!

874
01:38:48,689 --> 01:38:51,362
Are you Iaughing at me?
- oh, God, no.

875
01:38:51,769 --> 01:38:56,001
It's just that, here it is,
the most rotten time of my whoIe Iife.

876
01:38:56,409 --> 01:38:58,923
You're going away. I hate my schooI.

877
01:38:59,329 --> 01:39:01,889
The trip to Europe is off ...
- No!

878
01:39:02,289 --> 01:39:06,965
But, no, it's OK. That's what's funny,
it doesn't matter.

879
01:39:08,009 --> 01:39:11,479
It's OK now
'cause I know that you stiII Iove me.

880
01:39:11,889 --> 01:39:13,800
I do, I reaIIy do!

881
01:39:14,209 --> 01:39:17,201
I wish we couId run away
and be together aII the time.

882
01:39:18,489 --> 01:39:22,038
We can't run away, Diana.
- I know.

883
01:39:22,449 --> 01:39:25,680
But we can run away in our minds.

884
01:39:26,089 --> 01:39:30,844
We can remember the camp,
the mountains and ocean.

885
01:39:31,369 --> 01:39:34,406
The coIored rocks and biIIowy cotton.

886
01:39:34,809 --> 01:39:38,961
And New Year's Eve.
- EspeciaIIy New Year's Eve.

887
01:39:42,049 --> 01:39:43,482
And right now.

888
01:39:58,369 --> 01:40:00,837
We'II aIways be together, Diana.

889
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:05,444
Even when we can't be together.

890
01:40:34,209 --> 01:40:37,485
Sing us that oId number, Rocky.
How about it, Rusty? - Good idea!

891
01:40:37,889 --> 01:40:41,245
I'm up for it if he is.
- I'm feeIing tired tonight.

892
01:40:41,649 --> 01:40:44,766
Aw, come on, Rocky!
- Come on, you guys!

893
01:40:45,169 --> 01:40:47,046
Sing a number!

894
01:40:47,449 --> 01:40:49,121
You OK, babe?

895
01:40:49,729 --> 01:40:52,448
My head hurts a Iot tonight.

896
01:40:53,129 --> 01:40:57,680
You don't have to sing.
Go to bed and make yourseIf weII.

897
01:41:08,569 --> 01:41:11,845
How about it, Rusty? You gotta sing.

Goodnight, Rock.

01:43:48,569 --> 01:43:50,048
Come on, Screech.

902
01:44:04,729 --> 01:44:06,959
Why don't we go back to bed?
- That's OK with me.

903
01:44:07,369 --> 01:44:10,998
I got to do this thing with Red.

01:44:25,849 --> 01:44:27,805
Yeah, I'm sure.

907
01:44:28,289 --> 01:44:30,484
What do you mean, he's not there?

01:45:10,009 --> 01:45:13,684
You sure as heII aren't getting
a schoIarship if you stay in the sack!

910
01:45:14,089 --> 01:45:17,684
You got a Spanish test,
didn't you? Afraid of a IittIe test?

911
01:45:20,529 --> 01:45:21,928
CoId.

912
01:45:23,049 --> 01:45:25,438
You've got your covers off you.

913
01:45:29,329 --> 01:45:31,889
Don't puII this shit with me, Rock!

Now you can go
anywhere you want, baby.

919
01:49:24,289 --> 01:49:26,928
These things are good:
Ice cream and cake.

920
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:30,480
A ride on a HarIey.
Monkeys in the trees.

921
01:49:30,889 --> 01:49:35,007
The rain on my tongue
and the sun shining on my face.

922
01:49:37,009 --> 01:49:40,285
These things are a drag:
Dust in my hair.

923
01:49:40,689 --> 01:49:43,487
HoIes in my shoes.
No money in my pocket

924
01:49:43,889 --> 01:49:46,767
and the sun
shining on my face.

925
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:54,000
