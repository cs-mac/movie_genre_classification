1
00:00:40,305 --> 00:00:42,334
Even the creation
of the universe kicked off

2
00:00:42,505 --> 00:00:45,582
with a four to the floor beat,

3
00:00:45,746 --> 00:00:48,855
and from the dawn of mankind
we have come together

4
00:00:49,026 --> 00:00:52,419
in numbers, in tribes.

5
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:59,343
And at the heart of this delirious
connection was music, always the music.

6
00:01:00,947 --> 00:01:03,784
This is the story of my tribe.

7
00:01:03,947 --> 00:01:05,103
♪ Turn it up

8
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,704
♪ Give it up

9
00:01:20,828 --> 00:01:23,785
♪ Oh, your smile is carved of stone

10
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:28,386
♪ And your eyes say take me home?

11
00:01:31,068 --> 00:01:33,698
- Are you ready?
- Let's have it.

12
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:43,945
All right, love.
We're here about the fag machine.

13
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,182
What about it?

14
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:47,578
Your coin dispenser
needs a new trip switch.

15
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:52,026
- Eh?
- It's proper fucked, love.

16
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,946
I'll go get t' landlord.
He's still in bed.

17
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,147
Oh, don't worry about it. We've got
a new one in the van. Just be two ticks.

18
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:02,940
Norman!

19
00:02:06,511 --> 00:02:07,863
Fucking chancers.

20
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:12,428
- Hurting my back, this is, Matthew.
- Good. That means it's full.

21
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:20,143
- Go on, then.
- Got it.

22
00:02:20,871 --> 00:02:22,061
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oi!

23
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:24,828
What you fucking doing,
you fucking little bastards?

24
00:02:24,992 --> 00:02:29,105
Oh, yeah, fucking lovely, Matt.

25
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:32,225
I want a bigger percentage
for this one, mate.

26
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:34,268
Get a move on. Get a move on.

27
00:02:34,432 --> 00:02:37,541
No, no, no, no, no.

28
00:02:37,712 --> 00:02:38,989
Oh, mate!

29
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:47,746
Give me my fucking machine back,
you little bollocks!

30
00:02:47,873 --> 00:02:50,186
- Who do you think you are?
- Drive, drive, drive, drive!

31
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:52,902
I can't get it started.
I can't make it start.

32
00:02:53,073 --> 00:02:56,750
- The door. Shut the bloody door.
- You dirty dodgy bastard.

33
00:03:03,794 --> 00:03:05,986
Oh, that was fucking horrible, man.

34
00:03:08,234 --> 00:03:10,307
You little shits! Wankers!

35
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,149
Wee Man, will you shut the fuck up?!

36
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:39,106
You're making me lose count!

37
00:03:39,316 --> 00:03:42,829
- I'm fucking working here.
- All right, Peanut. Chill your willy.

38
00:03:42,996 --> 00:03:45,626
Fucking hell.

39
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:51,274
Put the sticks down, Phil Collins. Get
over here and start fucking grafting.

40
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:53,313
Put 'em down and come round here.

41
00:03:53,477 --> 00:03:55,310
D'you know how we can make
some big-boy dough?

42
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:58,150
- Some proper money♪ I'll tell you...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43
00:03:59,877 --> 00:04:02,146
It should be on by now.

44
00:04:02,357 --> 00:04:04,113
Well, maybe he's changed frequency.

45
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,510
We'd have heard
if he'd changed frequency.

46
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:08,707
It's open!

47
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:13,468
The guy wouldn't shut up.
I didn't know what to do.

48
00:04:13,638 --> 00:04:16,672
I had to sit on his face in the end
just to get him to be quiet.

49
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:19,628
Oi, oi!

50
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,391
All right?

51
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:27,869
Here we fucking are. Now it's starting.
Now we're fucking starting.

52
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,829
- How you doing♪ Where you been?
- Can't complain. Where've you been?

53
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:34,315
- Aye, aye, Mancunia.
- Hey, here's the Captain.

54
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,076
- I knew he hadn't changed frequencies.
- Hoist the Jolly Roger.

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,831
Captain Acid's back, riding the airwaves
off the coast of Turntable Towers.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,478
Mm-hm. Location undisclosed.

57
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:53,950
Ee by gum. Running into them thar hills.

58
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:56,150
It's Blackburn, baby.

59
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:00,518
Six... 40...

60
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:04,151
Oh, no. That's 49... Fuck it, 50.

61
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:07,038
Fucking wait up. I'm the one
who's got all the fucking pills.

62
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:10,235
Taking you out into the night
and on one,

63
00:05:10,402 --> 00:05:13,991
through the skeletons
of the industrial northwest.

64
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:18,635
Come, my children,
let me take you by the hand

65
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:22,151
and I will guide you
down the Devil's Highway.

66
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,955
Yes! You know what I'm talking about.

67
00:05:26,122 --> 00:05:28,675
Call the usual number.

68
00:05:28,882 --> 00:05:32,876
Tonight's mission, if you choose
to accept it, is a big one.

69
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:36,952
It's the biggest.
Have I ever let you down♪ No.

70
00:05:37,123 --> 00:05:41,313
For more details, the usual number.

71
00:05:44,884 --> 00:05:46,717
- All right, lads?
- Cheers.

72
00:05:46,884 --> 00:05:50,593
- Are you taking the piss, son?
- It's for all six, so. ..

73
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:55,041
- Every fucking time.
- You're a good lad.

74
00:05:55,204 --> 00:05:57,201
- Cheers, babe.
- Love you.

75
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,678
Come on!

76
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:27,883
♪ I need a lover tonight

77
00:06:29,447 --> 00:06:31,596
♪ I need a lover

78
00:06:32,966 --> 00:06:35,563

00:06:36,607 --> 00:06:40,077

00:06:40,247 --> 00:06:42,560

♪ Who's gonna treat me so right...?

87
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:59,761
- How can you be cold?
- You're not?

88
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,488
- It's not on, Matthew.
- What, mate?

89
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:08,129
Check it.

90
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:11,042
Oh, what♪ It's a recession
and all that lot wanna do

91
00:08:11,172 --> 00:08:12,765
is lock people up for dancing.

92
00:08:12,973 --> 00:08:16,006
- This shit's a warning.
- Fuck that, mate, it's a wake-up call.

93
00:08:16,173 --> 00:08:18,442
We've gotta do
what we've gotta do, Matt, ASAP.

94
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:20,402
Before that lot
turn it into a police state.

95
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,090
- That's it.
- What you talking about?

96
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,489
Valhalla, my little ducky,
ducky, ducky do.

97
00:08:24,653 --> 00:08:28,123
It's a ceremony for, like,
the souls of dead Vikings and that.

98
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,810
Dead Vikings♪ You've lost me.

99
00:08:30,974 --> 00:08:33,931
We're gonna hold our own rave.
Something special.

100
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:35,563
- Mad.
- Are you serious?

101
00:08:35,734 --> 00:08:37,567
- Yeah.
- We're gonna need security and that.

102
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:39,730
- Maurice and Nigel.
- Are you tripping?

103
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,612
- Yeah, obviously, a little bit.
- No, I mean, they're psychos.

104
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,251
No, they've calmed right down since
they got into their Es and whatnot.

105
00:08:49,415 --> 00:08:51,804
What about a DJ and a sound system?

106
00:08:51,975 --> 00:08:55,805
Will you stop asking questions, Claire?
There's no need. We're onto it.

107
00:08:58,055 --> 00:08:59,691
Oi, oi! Come on, let's do one.

108
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:02,528
Piss off, you lot!
You're fucking boring!

109
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:07,885
Go behind, go behind.

110
00:09:21,137 --> 00:09:22,369
Go, go, go!

111
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:50,488
- How did you find me?
- We just asked around.

112
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:54,216
'Cause everybody knows that Turntable
Towers is in one of these blocks.

113
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,332
- So we figured...
- Everyone but the dibble.

114
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:59,095
They know jack shit, thick fuckers.

115
00:10:00,739 --> 00:10:02,768
So d'you know Captain Acid,
then, or what?

116
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:07,849
Might do.
How do I know you two ain't dibble?

117
00:10:08,019 --> 00:10:11,293
- Do we look like dibble?
- He does.

118
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,297
- Look, mate, d'you know him or not?
- Just a little bit.

119
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,730
I'm his manager.

120
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,897
Oh.

121
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:24,249
But the Captain
only promotes the parties

122
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,096
he defo knows are gonna be buzzing.

123
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,657
- Yeah, we know, we know.
- Yeah.

124
00:10:27,821 --> 00:10:35,011
So how do we know that yours isn't
gonna be a steaming bag of shite, eh?

125
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:37,298
You know what I mean?
It's your first do.

126
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:41,410
What if he's walloping the arse
out of it on his station, right,

127
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,894
and his loyal following
turn up on the night

128
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:47,891
to find you two and some school fucking
disco lights and a tape of the...

129
00:10:48,062 --> 00:10:50,298
- Agadoo?
- Agadoo, exactly.

130
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,612
No, that's what we wanted
to talk to the Captain about.

131
00:10:52,782 --> 00:10:54,375
How d'you mean?

132
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:59,339
We need a DJ,
so if he wants a gig, it's his.

133
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:03,936
- What, for cash and everything?
- Yeah.

134
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:09,420
All right. This is where he's at,
for the moment.

135
00:11:09,663 --> 00:11:12,860
You'll have to be quick, though,
'cause he will be off.

136
00:11:16,183 --> 00:11:17,940
I'll tell him to expect you.

137
00:11:23,504 --> 00:11:24,497
Yeah!

138
00:11:24,664 --> 00:11:28,177
Can't believe we're gonna meet
Captain Acid. This guy's a legend.

139
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:30,133
All right, Matthew,
get out his arse.

140
00:11:30,304 --> 00:11:31,821
Leave the talking to me, yeah?

141
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,538
So is Claire your bird now then or what?

142
00:11:34,705 --> 00:11:37,214
What♪ She's one of my best mates.
How would that work?

143
00:11:37,425 --> 00:11:40,621
A best mate that you hope to eventually
experiment sexually with?

144
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:44,375
It's not like that. We just get loved up
sometimes, that's all.

145
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:45,777
- Loved up?
- Yeah.

146
00:11:45,945 --> 00:11:49,819
Now you listen to yourself, Matthew.
You'll be writing her poetry next.

147
00:11:50,025 --> 00:11:51,542
- Are you finished?
- No.

148
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:54,182
So she's not your bird,
just a mate with benefits?

149
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:55,862
Yeah, something like that.

150
00:11:55,986 --> 00:11:58,223
Matthew, you could've said that
from down there, man.

151
00:11:58,386 --> 00:12:02,663
I did explain it. You're asking
too many questions, mate.

152
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:04,823
- It's gotta be one of these ones.
- Oh, fuck it.

153
00:12:04,986 --> 00:12:07,419
- Right, one more.
- Oh, gravity.

154
00:12:08,266 --> 00:12:10,263
Ooh.

155
00:12:11,187 --> 00:12:13,184
Right.

156
00:12:14,747 --> 00:12:17,976
- Captain Acid?
- Who is it?

157
00:12:18,147 --> 00:12:21,900
It's Matt and Dylan.
We spoke to Mickey Muddle.

158
00:12:23,268 --> 00:12:25,264
It's open.

159
00:12:39,668 --> 00:12:41,665
So you had a chat with Mickey,
then, yeah?

160
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:46,345
- Eh?
- Mickey Muddle, me manager?

161
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,858
- What the fuck?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. We spoke to Mickey.

162
00:12:54,389 --> 00:12:57,466
Don't tell no one you were here, right?
No one.

163
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:59,866
Sound.

164
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:03,027
Did Mickey. .. did he tell you
about the money and that?

165
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:07,259
Talk dollar to Mickey.
Whatever he says is cool with me, man.

166
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:10,026
I trust him. He's a nice man.

167
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:17,299
So. .. are we on, then, or what?

168
00:13:23,831 --> 00:13:27,541
Arrrrr!

169
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:29,587
Jim lad!

170
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:32,228
Arr, Jim lad, and Valhalla Promotions

171
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:35,109
present something very special
for the weekend.

172
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,506
Thanks for helping an' that, Dad.

173
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:56,470
This place pays me less than the social
would, so you fill your boots.

174
00:13:57,633 --> 00:14:01,583
So, um, this is one of those,
uh, raves, is it?

175
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:03,783
Yeah, but, I mean,
it's not what you think it is.

176
00:14:03,913 --> 00:14:05,746
- It's all right, son. I understand.
- Yeah?

177
00:14:05,914 --> 00:14:08,707
Yeah, I understand what you're trying
to do with the parties and that

178
00:14:08,874 --> 00:14:10,707
and trying to get something going.

179
00:14:10,834 --> 00:14:12,590
This is Elvis all over again.

180
00:14:12,714 --> 00:14:14,547
Actually, no,
this is more Northern Soul.

181
00:14:14,675 --> 00:14:18,308
- What you on about now, Roger?
- We're registering our disapproval.

182
00:14:18,474 --> 00:14:22,588
That's what Thatcher doesn't understand.
It's not about us dancing in warehouses.

183
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:26,071
Youth challenging the hierarchy's
a timeless tradition.

184
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:28,231
She's fighting evolution.

185
00:14:30,515 --> 00:14:32,871
You wanna hang on to her.

186
00:14:33,035 --> 00:14:34,312
Yeah.

187
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,025
- I've got it, I've got it.
- Got it?

188
00:14:39,196 --> 00:14:40,385
- Yeah.
- Let me have a go.

189
00:14:40,556 --> 00:14:42,748
- No, no, no, no.
- Go on, just twist it.

190
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,033
- Come on.
- Twist it.

191
00:14:48,476 --> 00:14:49,992
Whoo!

192
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:00,270
Oh, lads, this is the one.
What did I say?

193
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:02,226
Follow me, follow me, follow me.

194
00:15:02,357 --> 00:15:05,150
Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:05,317 --> 00:15:09,147
- Oh, let's have a look.
- What d'you reckon?

196
00:15:10,038 --> 00:15:13,234
- Fucking hell.
- Really fucking good.

197
00:15:13,438 --> 00:15:15,434
I'm thinking,
I'm thinking, I'm thinking...

198
00:15:15,597 --> 00:15:19,634
Look, we set up...
set up sounds here, right?

199
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:22,548
Get a nice. ..
Get an echo down here, both sides.

200
00:15:22,719 --> 00:15:24,475
Whoom, whoom, whoom, whom!

201
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:27,356
Queuing down there,
come in here, see this.

202
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,788
We'll have a bit of, you know,
sounds going up.

203
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,308
This it?
It smells like someone's died in here.

204
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:36,032
- Who are you?
- I'm the musical talent, mate.

205
00:15:36,199 --> 00:15:38,108
- Who are you?
- I supply the drugs, mate.

206
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,352
Nice to meet you.

207
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,313
Yes, mate, this is it.

208
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,153
Let's get this fucker powered up, man.

209
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,589
- Nigel, Maurice.
- What?

210
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,997
Can you just give us five minutes?
Me head's banging.

211
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,673
Right, there's 50 in each.
Usual deal. Eights on each.

212
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,153
- Knock 'em out for whatever you can.
- I love you, Peanut.

213
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,117
Sweet as, darling. Wee Man,
don't spank 'em all either, all right?

214
00:16:04,321 --> 00:16:06,830
I'm not coming round your house again
'cause you owe me money,

215
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,958
taking money off your mam.

216
00:16:13,081 --> 00:16:16,398
Here you go, mate. On the house.
Keep 'em dancing, eh?

217
00:16:16,562 --> 00:16:18,831
- Nice one, man.
- Good for business.

218
00:16:21,002 --> 00:16:22,475
We got power yet?

219
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:26,915
Or am I using sign language
to communicate my musical vibrations?

220
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:29,199
Yeah, we're working on it, mate.

221
00:16:30,843 --> 00:16:32,631
Sure your cousins know
what they're doing?

222
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:36,360
Of course I do, Matthew.
Fully qualified.

223
00:16:36,522 --> 00:16:39,119
Manchester Poly. O level.

224
00:16:39,283 --> 00:16:41,956
- Official sparks, these pair.
- Right.

225
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:47,915
- No.
- Nothing.

226
00:16:48,124 --> 00:16:50,753
Nothing. Maybe it's this thing here.

227
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:54,276
What they doing now, then?

228
00:16:57,964 --> 00:17:00,037
Oh, fucking hell, soft lad!

229
00:17:00,204 --> 00:17:02,354
There she blows!

230
00:17:02,524 --> 00:17:06,474
Captain Acid's got the good shit. Yes!

231
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:08,841
Just need people.

232
00:17:09,005 --> 00:17:11,755
- We're fucking raving now, Matthew.
- Just needs people.

233
00:17:11,925 --> 00:17:13,713
- Eh?
- It just needs people.

234
00:17:39,606 --> 00:17:42,835
It's like some fat twat
of a kid's birthday party

235
00:17:43,007 --> 00:17:44,359
where no one turns up, man.

236
00:17:45,767 --> 00:17:48,156
You sure you put the right date
on the flyer?

237
00:17:49,087 --> 00:17:50,560
Right.

238
00:17:50,727 --> 00:17:52,243
No need to panic, is there?

239
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:56,160
I mean, there's nothing at stake here
apart from your reputation as promoters.

240
00:17:56,328 --> 00:18:00,605
Oh, well, maybe no one's that interested
in your music no more, Captain Acid.

241
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:04,084
- Maybe you're all washed up.
- Lay off my audience.

242
00:18:04,288 --> 00:18:06,678
- They never miss a party.
- Clearly.

243
00:18:06,848 --> 00:18:09,958
Shut up.

244
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,166
They're coming. They're coming!

245
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:15,318
Oi, oi! Let's be having you!
Rave is this way.

246
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:17,518
I weren't bothered. I weren't bothered.

247
00:18:17,689 --> 00:18:19,958

248

00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:36,367
Fucking yes. Whoa!

269
00:19:38,614 --> 00:19:42,324
- Peanut, for you, my man.
- Something special for the Wee Man.

270
00:19:42,454 --> 00:19:45,608
Ey up, you still with us, mate?
You still there?

271
00:19:45,774 --> 00:19:47,171
Off your fucking nut, aren't you?

272
00:19:49,934 --> 00:19:53,043
Sarah, put your hand into my little bag
of naughties there, would you?

273
00:19:53,214 --> 00:19:56,127
Hold on, wait. What, we're getting paid
for having a top party?

274
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,531
- It's fucking mental, innit?
- Fucking, you lad!

275
00:19:58,694 --> 00:20:01,684
I want you to take it,
for helping out and that.

276
00:20:05,335 --> 00:20:08,248
It was the best fucking night
of my life.

277
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:11,285
- When are we doing that shit again?
- Oh, we're not.

278
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,845
Eh?

279
00:20:13,056 --> 00:20:16,210
Yeah, we done it. We got away with it.

280
00:20:17,016 --> 00:20:19,853
Yeah, Matt, man, we made a small
fucking fortune last night, buddy.

281
00:20:19,976 --> 00:20:23,085
Look, we got lucky.
No dibble, no dickheads.

282
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:27,250
Bob on. No worries.
Tell him he's being a fucking dickhead.

283
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,686
You're being a fucking dickhead, mate.

284
00:20:29,857 --> 00:20:31,929
Leave it out. I'm making sense here.

285
00:20:32,137 --> 00:20:36,851
It's a good thing it's not about
the money. 'Cause it's fucking fake.

286
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:38,574
- What?
- I'm serious.

287
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:39,930
- All of it?
- Some of it.

288
00:20:40,097 --> 00:20:43,927
Right, what is going on♪ You trying
to push dodgy notes on us now?

289
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:45,450
Nigel, what's this, mate?

290
00:20:45,617 --> 00:20:48,290
Eh, it was dark. I couldn't always see
what they were giving me.

291
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,367
- Money preferably, Nigel.
- What the fuck, Nige?

292
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:53,207
- Don't have a go at me!
- It's Maurice.

293
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,894
Whoa, whoa.
You know what this means?

294
00:20:57,178 --> 00:20:58,935
We're doing it again.

295
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:09,255
Come on!

296
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,177
Parliament spent most of Friday

297
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,576
debating the murky world
of acid house parties.

298
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,809
Acid house parties emerged
during the summer of 1988,

299
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,217
at first... at first. .. at first... at
first attracting a few hundred people,

300
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,130
Now thousands can gather
to dance all night.

301
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:34,170
Politicians are especially concerned

302
00:21:34,381 --> 00:21:38,211
that these parties are being run
by a cult of evil and corrupt men

303
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:40,450
who prey on young people.

304
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:44,091
Legislation has now been
introduced that gives police the power

305
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:48,255
to shut down. .. to shut down
the parties and arrest the organisers.

306
00:21:49,501 --> 00:21:52,535
The prime minister called on
young people to observe these new laws

307
00:21:52,661 --> 00:21:55,050
which she said were being introduced
for their own good.

308
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:58,015
Go on, lads, get in there!
Arrest the little bastards!

309
00:22:00,702 --> 00:22:02,732
Get in there! Get in there!

310
00:22:04,622 --> 00:22:07,218
There were chaotic scenes
both inside and outside

311
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:09,019
this Salford warehouse last night

312
00:22:09,223 --> 00:22:11,732
as police came to raid an illegal rave.

313
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:13,932
Well, I'm joined now
by Sergeant James Thompson.

314
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:16,220
He's leading the fight
against illegal parties.

315
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:19,612
Sergeant Thompson, what is your message
now to the rave community?

316
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,893
Well, my message is simple.
The party is over.

317
00:22:23,064 --> 00:22:25,933
While I'm happy for Manchester to be
at the forefront of popular culture,

318
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:27,932
this does not include
the misuse of drugs.

319
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:30,457
Myself and my team will be
looking to enforce that message

320
00:22:30,624 --> 00:22:33,614
throughout the now criminalised
so-called rave scene.

321
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:35,258
Wanker.

322
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:39,658
If you're not a legitimate club,
we will be targeting you.

323
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:51,062
All right, mate?

324
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:55,775
- All right, mate?
- Fucking hell. Where are you from?

325
00:22:55,945 --> 00:22:56,938
London.

326
00:22:57,825 --> 00:23:00,695
- It's taking the piss, mate.
- He's funny, in't he?

327
00:23:00,866 --> 00:23:03,855
I'm guessing you're the geezer
responsible for all this mental carnage.

328
00:23:04,026 --> 00:23:07,375
- Tell him, girls.
- Yeah.

329
00:23:08,706 --> 00:23:10,255
I'm Gary Mac.

330
00:23:10,387 --> 00:23:12,055
I'm Dylan.

331
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:14,184
This is Biggie.

332
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,063
So he is.

333
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:21,184
Is there somewhere we can have a natter?
A bit of business.

334
00:23:22,187 --> 00:23:24,217
Here you are, Matthew.
Look at the size of this one.

335
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:26,460
- Not him. Him.
- All right, mate?

336
00:23:29,028 --> 00:23:31,177
- Business looks good.
- Yeah, yeah.

337
00:23:31,348 --> 00:23:33,300
Just here doing some sightseeing,
are you?

338
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,464
- Drop of research, actually.
- Oh, yeah♪ What on?

339
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:37,297
How to party properly,
like a Northerner.

340
00:23:37,468 --> 00:23:40,621
You're having a fucking laugh,
in't you♪ We invented raving.

341
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:44,618
We invented rave up here,
just like we did canals...

342
00:23:44,789 --> 00:23:47,102
- Football..
- Obviously football. Buses.

343
00:23:47,269 --> 00:23:49,178
- Atomic theory.
- Northern Soul.

344
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:51,902
- Northern Soul.
- You forgot flat caps.

345
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:54,458
- See what he did there?
- Whey-hey!

346
00:23:54,629 --> 00:23:56,538
Oh, yeah,
you're a fucking joker, in't you?

347
00:23:58,389 --> 00:24:01,302
- Thank you very much, my son.
- You boys fancy a line?

348
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,659
A line?

349
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:05,659
Of coke?

350
00:24:05,829 --> 00:24:08,546
That's a very, very generous gesture,
Gary. Thank you very much.

351
00:24:08,709 --> 00:24:12,342
Shall we crack on?
Shut t' door, then, Peanut.

352
00:24:17,591 --> 00:24:19,947
- Matthew, you in?
- No.

353
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,379
I'm actually all right
for the old, uh...

354
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,948
Right, bang that up your nostril.

355
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:34,661
- Fuckin' hell, Gary.
- Eh?

356
00:24:34,831 --> 00:24:37,461
- Present from Maurice.
- Peanut. Peanut.

357
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:41,265
- Can you sort us out another 50?
- That's another 400 snots.

358
00:24:41,432 --> 00:24:44,466
- There you are. You owe me 12 now.
- Oh, one sec, mate.

359
00:24:44,672 --> 00:24:47,181
Not now, knobhead.
How many times have I told you?

360
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,388
End of the night, yeah?

361
00:24:48,593 --> 00:24:53,546
No offence, mate, but what are these
you selling♪ Sleeping tablets?

362
00:24:53,673 --> 00:24:56,826
- Them pills are top of the line, mate.
- Yeah, I doubt that very much.

363
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,589
These are, though.

364
00:25:00,313 --> 00:25:04,666
These, mate, are 100 % pure MDMA.
Straight off the plane.

365
00:25:04,873 --> 00:25:08,267
One of these will blow
your fucking minds.

366
00:25:08,393 --> 00:25:10,182
- Bollocks.
- Great. We look forward to it.

367
00:25:10,354 --> 00:25:14,227
I'm out of bags as well when you got
a second, Scarface. Hiya.

368
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:17,583
Here you are, Matt. Help yourself.

369
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,950
- Hey, why not?
- All right, then.

370
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:25,631
- Bang on, mate.
- Pleasure.

371
00:25:33,275 --> 00:25:35,108
Whoo!

372
00:25:35,275 --> 00:25:37,905
You boys ever heard of a club
called the Mushroom Cloud?

373
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:40,072
Mushroom♪ No, mate.

374
00:25:41,555 --> 00:25:44,632
- You boys ever left Manchester?
- No, actually, you know what, Gaz?

375
00:25:44,796 --> 00:25:46,552
- I'm from Derby.
- Yeah, he's from Derby.

376
00:25:46,716 --> 00:25:49,553
Is he♪ Is he♪ That's fascinating.
Absolutely fascinating.

377
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:51,025
Yeah.

378
00:25:51,196 --> 00:25:54,349
Why don't you
broaden your horizons?

379
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,949
- Come and check us out.
- Yeah, we'll do that, Matthew.

380
00:26:03,636 --> 00:26:05,950
Might wanna come outside, lads.

381
00:26:16,717 --> 00:26:17,753
How can I help you?

382
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:19,793
Have you got permission
for this party?

383
00:26:19,957 --> 00:26:21,670
It's just a private party.

384
00:26:21,838 --> 00:26:24,314
A private party
that costs £15 to get in?

385
00:26:24,518 --> 00:26:26,547
That's a voluntary contribution,
for charity.

386
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,194
- What charity?
- Save the whales.

387
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:31,351
I like whales. D'you like 'em?

388
00:26:31,518 --> 00:26:35,435
They're big, but they're also gentle.

389
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:38,309
And they're blue,
and blue's my favourite colour.

390
00:26:38,478 --> 00:26:41,075
Hey, you're blue. I like you too.

391
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,709
Are you on drugs?

392
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:54,669
Absolutely not. Ridiculous suggestion.

393
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,236
I'll be seeing you again.

394
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:03,674
I hope so. I enjoyed our little chat.

395
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,513
Why's he going away?
I was just talking to him.

396
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:12,718
That was fucking absolutely majestic.
Oh, brother. Fucking majestic.

397
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:16,995
Oi, how do you two fuckers
fancy a party in Ibiza?

398
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:20,710
- He's fucking serious.
- Yeah, man.

399
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:24,078
Bloody hell, man.
You're only bloody serious.

400
00:27:43,523 --> 00:27:47,800
Ey up, mate. What about our amigo?

401
00:27:47,963 --> 00:27:50,559
There's only one of him, mate,
but we forgot him at the airport.

402
00:27:50,723 --> 00:27:54,401
Yeah, he's only the DJ, like.
Think it might be wise to do a U-ey.

403
00:27:54,564 --> 00:27:56,080
- Yeah?
- Comprende?

404
00:27:56,243 --> 00:27:59,440
- Eh?
- U-ey?

405
00:28:24,565 --> 00:28:26,595
Whoa.

406
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:31,834
- Hola, boys!
- Hey! Gaz the Mac.

407
00:28:32,006 --> 00:28:32,954
All right, mate?

408
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:37,722
Yeah, I mean,
don't get me wrong, I love it.

409
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:39,599
But I just wanna put
a bit more colour in,

410
00:28:39,766 --> 00:28:42,679
get some daisies, pansies,
you know, bluebells.

411
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:45,083
Bring a bit of England to Espanol.

412
00:28:45,246 --> 00:28:47,635
Hang on. Where's the Captain?

413
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:49,879
That's what we were saying.
He's had a right hoorah.

414
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:52,163
We had a problem at the airport, mate.
He got lost.

415
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:56,201
Listen, senor, do I look like
I've got any drugs on me?

416
00:28:57,247 --> 00:28:59,561
This will hurt very much.

417
00:28:59,687 --> 00:29:05,285
El problemo, the airporto,
el Capitan Acide.

418
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:07,841
- Vamos.
- So he comprendeyed that, then, yeah?

419
00:29:07,967 --> 00:29:11,405
Course he did.
Now, let me show you the crown jewel.

420
00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:38,806
I'll show you to your rooms.

421
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:49,966
- He's got a gun.
- Who?

422
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:52,367
That guy with the weird beard
in the jeep. I saw it.

423
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:55,084
It's probably just for show,
all that shit is.

424
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:57,248
Well, we should keep an eye on things,
all right?

425
00:29:57,411 --> 00:29:59,199
That's what I'm talking about.

426
00:29:59,371 --> 00:30:01,368
Ooh!

427
00:30:01,531 --> 00:30:03,320
Whey!

428
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:06,164
- Keep an eye on that, you mean.
- Oi, are you listening?

429
00:30:06,331 --> 00:30:08,645
- Mmm.
- Weirdy beardy's got a gun.

430
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:12,249
Matt! Will you relax?

431
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,604
Will you please sit down♪ Please.

432
00:30:16,892 --> 00:30:19,609
- What have we come here to do, Matt?
- Meet Gary Mac.

433
00:30:19,812 --> 00:30:21,885
- Mm-hm. What else?
- Not get shot.

434
00:30:22,052 --> 00:30:27,966
Party, exactly. So, one for me...
and one for mi amigo.

435
00:30:28,133 --> 00:30:31,242
- I'm all right, mate.
- Well, two for me to the D, then.

436
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:33,365
Bob on.

437
00:30:41,013 --> 00:30:43,610
Mm-hm.

438
00:30:43,774 --> 00:30:45,247
Oh!

439
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,403
Muchas gracias.

440
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,007
Cor blimey.

441
00:30:53,174 --> 00:30:56,283
Oh! That shit's phenomenal, Gaz.

442
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:58,690
Better than the stuff
they serve up back home, eh?

443
00:31:00,135 --> 00:31:04,772
Here you are, here's something else the
Spaniards have got on us. Look at this.

444
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:08,172
Hey.

445
00:31:13,696 --> 00:31:16,129
- Cheers, boys.
- Cheers.

446
00:31:22,296 --> 00:31:24,805
Gaz, nice one, seriously.

447
00:31:24,976 --> 00:31:26,929
It's my absolute pleasure, mate.

448
00:31:27,096 --> 00:31:30,489
So, why are we here?
What's the catch, eh?

449
00:31:30,616 --> 00:31:32,929
- Don't talk wet. It's boring.
- Eh, leave it.

450
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:37,973
No, no, no. He's right.
There's always an agenda.

451
00:31:38,097 --> 00:31:41,086
I thought I'd invite you out into
the sunshine to talk a bit of business.

452
00:31:41,257 --> 00:31:44,967
- Business, yeah.
- I'm planning a load of mega-raves.

453
00:31:45,138 --> 00:31:47,614
Massive events, shitloads of money.

454
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:49,413
- What?
- Where?

455
00:31:49,577 --> 00:31:52,174
Here, Berlin, Paris, Amsterdam.

456
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:55,175
A few finishing touches.
Starts next summer.

457
00:31:55,338 --> 00:31:58,534
And I'm looking for some new promoters
to come on board.

458
00:31:58,698 --> 00:32:00,891
So, basically, Gaz,
what you want us to do

459
00:32:01,058 --> 00:32:06,775
is, you know, promote a load of top
parties, invite a load of sexy ladies,

460
00:32:06,939 --> 00:32:08,968
dot around Europe
and get paid in doing so?

461
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:12,015
- Only if you're interested.
- What do you reckon?

462
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:16,735
- I'm gonna have a little ponder.
- What do you think, mate?

463
00:32:16,939 --> 00:32:20,213
- Gaz Mac, I think you've got a deal.
- I thought you'd say yes.

464
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:22,409
Easy lads. Fuckin'...

465
00:32:22,619 --> 00:32:27,092
Fuckin' all right, my bad.
No big deal. I'll get you another.

466
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,129
Lads, I'm Dylan.

467
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,210
Problem, boys?

468
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,890
No. No problem. How are you, Gareth?
You keeping well♪ You look well.

469
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:40,133
Why don't you enjoy the party?

470
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:43,297
Yeah, I think I might do that.

471
00:32:44,101 --> 00:32:46,098
Lovely to meet you, Dylan.

472
00:32:47,461 --> 00:32:49,490
Top.

473
00:32:50,581 --> 00:32:52,653
Off you pop.

474
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:54,174
Who was that?

475
00:32:54,382 --> 00:32:58,812
One of your lot. John Anderson,
also known as John the Rat.

476
00:32:58,981 --> 00:33:01,654
- John the Rat?
- Don't ask.

477
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:04,178
He stitched me up
when I was first starting out.

478
00:33:04,342 --> 00:33:05,935
Thinks I don't know about it.

479
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,931
- But you do know.
- I know everything.

480
00:33:09,102 --> 00:33:12,255
- Aye aye!
- Acide!

481
00:33:12,422 --> 00:33:14,178
What happened to you
at the airport?

482
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:18,412
Luggage issues.
Anyway, let's get this party started.

483
00:33:18,583 --> 00:33:21,059
- I'm gonna go for a walk, mate.
- You all right?

484
00:33:22,703 --> 00:33:24,372
Oh, bloody hell fire.

485
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:27,052
Come on, Dylan.
Let's go and party, mate.

486
00:33:27,223 --> 00:33:30,780
- Where's that soft tart gone?
- Oh, clear his head. Don't worry.

487
00:34:03,185 --> 00:34:05,978
Whey-hey, mi amigo!

488
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:10,135
What are you doing, you fanny?

489
00:34:11,706 --> 00:34:13,103
Just having a chill.

490
00:34:13,266 --> 00:34:16,255
D'you know how many boobs
are going unconcealed up there?

491
00:34:17,426 --> 00:34:20,819
- Yeah, I'll be there in a minute.
- We'll never see 'em all, man.

492
00:34:20,946 --> 00:34:22,943
Come on. Vamos.

493
00:34:24,666 --> 00:34:25,702
All right, I'm coming.

494
00:34:32,947 --> 00:34:35,664
Aye aye, seaman!

495
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:38,503
- Aye aye, Captain.
- Aye aye.

496
00:34:38,667 --> 00:34:42,225
Big shout going out
to the Valhalla crew!

497
00:34:49,268 --> 00:34:51,537
Go on, then. So I'm not suave?

498
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,584
What?

499
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:58,226
Ey up. Can I get one of these
to them three there?

500
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,737
You see them?
The girls with the boobies♪ Great.

501
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:30,147
Ey up, lads, ladies.

502
00:35:30,271 --> 00:35:31,623
All right, Dylan?

503
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:34,340
Anisha and the girls
wanted to give you a bit of advice.

504
00:35:34,551 --> 00:35:37,104
If you are gonna send champagne over
as an apology,

505
00:35:37,231 --> 00:35:40,024
then don't make it the cheapest bottle
at the free bar.

506
00:35:40,192 --> 00:35:42,308
It's considered poor form, my mate.

507
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:53,669
I know fuck all about champagne, lads,
in all honesty.

508
00:35:53,872 --> 00:35:57,101
I just thought
kicking off earlier, like...

509
00:35:57,272 --> 00:35:58,908
just gesture, you know what I mean?

510
00:36:10,993 --> 00:36:14,342
Well, I mean, we're all England here.
Derby, Manchester...

511
00:36:14,513 --> 00:36:18,462
Manchester♪ Who the fuck said
I was from Manchester?

512
00:36:18,673 --> 00:36:21,543
I'm from Salford. It's its own city
with its own cathedral.

513
00:36:23,074 --> 00:36:26,587
Dylan, do you know who I am?

514
00:36:28,514 --> 00:36:32,388
- Yeah, John the Rat.
- Rats are fucking vermin, Dylan.

515
00:36:32,554 --> 00:36:34,747
Are you trying to say
that I'm fucking vermin?

516
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,111
- No, am I fuck?
- Do I look like a fucking rat?

517
00:36:37,274 --> 00:36:39,904
What is it, me teeth?
Do I look like a fucking rat?!

518
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,431
Do you fuck♪ No.

519
00:36:42,595 --> 00:36:44,625
Do I fuck?!

520
00:36:50,796 --> 00:36:53,065
We're just messing with you, sweetheart.

521
00:36:53,236 --> 00:36:55,505
It's all right. Don't panic.

522
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:59,385
Go for a swim later.

523
00:36:59,556 --> 00:37:02,032
So you're the Valhalla boys?
You do those Valhalla nights?

524
00:37:02,196 --> 00:37:03,985
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, me and...

525
00:37:04,156 --> 00:37:07,505
Well, they sound like wild parties,
lots of punters and that.

526
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:10,906
Proper. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's our
DJ, look. He's a nutter. Look at him.

527
00:37:11,077 --> 00:37:14,186
Yeah, yeah, come down. Come down, man,
yeah, it'll be fucking sweet.

528
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:17,109
Just ask for Dylan and I'll see you
there, lads, yeah, back at home.

529
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,547
Guest list. Fucking VIP.
Free drinks and that.

530
00:37:20,718 --> 00:37:22,594
We'll have a right knees-up.
It'll be top.

531
00:37:22,717 --> 00:37:24,550
- We'd be on the guest list?
- Yeah, man.

532
00:37:24,718 --> 00:37:27,391
- What, really on the guest list?
- No problems, lads. Honestly.

533
00:37:27,518 --> 00:37:30,147
- You'd do that for us?
- Course I would, man.

534
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:32,951
Cheers, Dylan!

535
00:37:34,478 --> 00:37:37,991
Check out Billy Big Bollocks here. Eh?

536
00:37:38,159 --> 00:37:41,148
Do you have a pen and a pad
and everything?

537
00:37:42,598 --> 00:37:46,112
- Have a nice little time?
- Fucking guest list.

538
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:50,552
Have a safe trip home,
sweetheart.

539
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,994
I've got good vibes about
this place. It's feeling homely already.

540
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,634
- One of youse Dylan?
- Yeah, me.

541
00:38:24,801 --> 00:38:25,793
Yeah, that's him.

542
00:38:29,801 --> 00:38:31,918
- This place stinks of dog shit.
- No, it's a sound job.

543
00:38:32,042 --> 00:38:33,875
- You boys into rubber?
- Eh?

544
00:38:34,042 --> 00:38:35,710
What?

545
00:38:35,882 --> 00:38:39,799
Rubber products.
That's what this factory makes.

546
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:41,279
At least, it used to.

547
00:38:41,442 --> 00:38:44,551
Actually, we're just gonna hire it out,
for a party.

548
00:38:44,762 --> 00:38:47,479
- What kind of party?
- It's a rave party, Tommy.

549
00:38:47,683 --> 00:38:49,919
Seen something on the news
about that raving.

550
00:38:50,082 --> 00:38:52,319
- Not sure I like the look of it.
- We're paying in cash.

551
00:38:52,522 --> 00:38:55,839
- Bloody right you are.
- Yeah, yeah, sort you out.

552
00:38:58,203 --> 00:39:01,357
- Shall I just count...?
- Yeah, take that. Take that.

553
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:05,793
- Right. We're in business.
- Yes, we are.

554
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:08,833
I can't see who's gonna come to this
shithole for their Friday night out.

555
00:39:09,004 --> 00:39:13,793
No, Tommy. You'll be amazed, mate,
fucking amazed.

556
00:39:16,444 --> 00:39:17,601
Friggin' amazed.

557
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:27,198
Keep moving.

558
00:39:28,245 --> 00:39:31,235
Come on. Come on, love.
Enjoy yourselves.

559
00:39:33,845 --> 00:39:36,955
Have fun. It's good in there.

560
00:39:40,566 --> 00:39:42,562
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

561
00:39:44,606 --> 00:39:46,963
- Just hang on a minute.
- Leave off, mate.

562
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:50,643
- Ten quid each.
- Fuckin' hell.

563
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,643
Yes. Go on, off you go,
off you go. All right?

564
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,763
Hang on there, boys.

565
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,720
New rule. From now on we stash
the cash off the premises, all right?

566
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:02,003
All right, boss.

567
00:40:02,167 --> 00:40:04,437
Hey, get your hand
off that fucking torch.

568
00:40:04,607 --> 00:40:06,604
You get a torch when you pay.

569
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,528
Hey! Hey! Maurice! Nigel!

570
00:41:10,291 --> 00:41:12,288
- Fuck off!
- Leave it!

571
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:17,604
- Get out of my way! Shift, shift!
- Coming through. Coming through.

572
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:20,324
Get the fuck off me!

573
00:41:21,852 --> 00:41:25,201
Get out! Go on, fuck off!

574
00:41:27,732 --> 00:41:31,562
Oh, Peanut! Oh, those fucking
scallies! I could kick their heads in.

575
00:41:31,772 --> 00:41:34,445
Every time they saw you dealing,
they were straight over for a word.

576
00:41:34,613 --> 00:41:36,642
Or to hit you in the face with a torch.

577
00:41:36,812 --> 00:41:39,126
Sorry, mate.
And it wasn't just you as well.

578
00:41:39,292 --> 00:41:41,922
He was twatting this little posh kid
in the bogs when I was in there.

579
00:41:42,053 --> 00:41:44,802
So maybe we should think about
sorting a new venue, right?

580
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:48,042
- What a stupid, daft comment, Matt.
- What♪ Have you seen his nose?

581
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:50,526
Gaz Mac'll tell you,
things are rocking here, man.

582
00:41:50,654 --> 00:41:52,651
- Yeah, but...
- Business is booming.

583
00:41:52,814 --> 00:41:56,087
Look, lads, lads.
Nige, say that thing that you said.

584
00:41:56,254 --> 00:41:59,047
Look, we can't keep 'em out, yeah?

585
00:41:59,214 --> 00:42:02,127
But we may be able to keep 'em sweet.

586
00:42:02,294 --> 00:42:04,051
- How's that?
- Maurice.

587
00:42:04,215 --> 00:42:07,171
We'll have a word,
let their top boys in for free.

588
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:10,005
They can do their bit.
We'll turn a blind eye.

589
00:42:10,174 --> 00:42:11,691
What, so we let them deal?

590
00:42:11,855 --> 00:42:15,128
Matt, it's either that
or they take the place by force.

591
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:18,568
Right, well,
I'm glad we got that sorted, then.

592
00:42:18,695 --> 00:42:21,892
Anyway, I'm off.
I'm gonna go pick up my keys.

593
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,208
What♪ Keys♪ What keys?

594
00:42:24,335 --> 00:42:26,211
You're serious
about moving out of our place?

595
00:42:26,375 --> 00:42:29,769
Yeah, we gotta think about
our image now, mate.

596
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:34,653
I need a proper pad, man.
We're big-time players.

597
00:42:35,456 --> 00:42:37,212
Oh.

598
00:42:38,416 --> 00:42:40,172
Ta-ra.

599
00:42:40,336 --> 00:42:42,889
- Whey-hey!
- Take it easy, yeah?

600
00:42:43,017 --> 00:42:45,330
Eh, my advice,
buy a packet of Frosties, early doors.

601
00:42:45,497 --> 00:42:47,526
- Sort yourself out for the week.
- I'm listening.

602
00:42:47,697 --> 00:42:50,447
Fuck this. Come here.

603
00:42:50,617 --> 00:42:54,010
- I've got a spare microwave at home.
- Come here, get in.

604
00:42:54,617 --> 00:42:57,093
If you need some food,
you come straight to me mum's, yeah?

605
00:42:57,298 --> 00:43:00,091
- Get some rice and "ting", Sarah.
- Yeah, she's here, come on.

606
00:43:00,258 --> 00:43:01,293
The main girl.

607
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:05,735
Off all the people here, who do you
reckon needs an hug more than most?

608
00:43:08,258 --> 00:43:11,051
He's only going down the fucking road.

609
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:23,936
You know when you said that
I could talk to you about anything?

610
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:25,852
Mm-mm.

611
00:43:26,019 --> 00:43:28,932
How would that work exactly?

612
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:33,332
Depends.
Have you got something to confess?

613
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,453
No.

614
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,772
Actually, there was this one thing.

615
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:50,894
In Ibiza, there was a girl,
and it's been killing me ever since.

616
00:43:55,501 --> 00:43:57,410
Actually, I'm relieved.

617
00:43:57,581 --> 00:44:01,258
- Yeah♪ Why?
- Because you're being honest.

618
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:04,214
I think we need to be honest
with each other for this to work.

619
00:44:04,421 --> 00:44:06,177
Yeah.

620
00:44:08,022 --> 00:44:10,051
In that case
I've gotta tell you something.

621
00:44:10,262 --> 00:44:12,259
Go ahead. Sure.

622
00:44:18,503 --> 00:44:20,619
I slept with Dylan.

623
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,656
But it was before me and you got
together, and it didn't mean anything.

624
00:44:25,823 --> 00:44:28,932
But I just thought it was better
that you heard it from me first.

625
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:31,699
- How many times?
- Once.

626
00:44:31,863 --> 00:44:34,972
It was just like a stupid one-off thing.

627
00:44:35,183 --> 00:44:37,180
How was it?

628
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,853
Uninspiring.

629
00:44:44,824 --> 00:44:47,257
Does that make you feel better?

630
00:44:47,424 --> 00:44:49,334
Yeah.

631
00:44:52,905 --> 00:44:55,698
Well, I didn't think it was that big
a deal, Matthew, to be fair, mate.

632
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:58,418
Not that much of a big deal
you just shagged my girlfriend?

633
00:44:58,584 --> 00:45:01,257
- She wasn't your girlfriend then.
- But she is now.

634
00:45:02,145 --> 00:45:04,174
Am I shagging her now?

635
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:06,218
No.

636
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:09,422
She wasn't your girlfriend when you was
having your way with that other lass.

637
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:10,742
That was a mistake.

638
00:45:10,905 --> 00:45:13,261
No, Matthew,
this is a fucking mistake, mate.

639
00:45:13,426 --> 00:45:16,263
You can't see what she's trying to do?
That's fucking embarrassing.

640
00:45:16,466 --> 00:45:17,459
What?

641
00:45:17,586 --> 00:45:19,342
She's trying to drive
a wedge between us.

642
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:21,222
She wants to fucking control you.

643
00:45:21,306 --> 00:45:23,576
She'll have you wearing
matching fucking tracksuits.

644
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:25,776
Said you were a shit shag, anyway.

645
00:45:27,426 --> 00:45:30,580
Well, I doubt that, Matt, but...
She's fucking here again.

646
00:45:30,707 --> 00:45:34,023
- You're making it like this, mate.
- I can't be arsed, Matthew.

647
00:45:34,187 --> 00:45:37,144
- What did I fucking say?
- Why are you walking away, then?

648
00:45:37,307 --> 00:45:39,740
- Happy now?
- After last week, we're full.

649
00:45:39,907 --> 00:45:42,264
- I didn't twat you, did I?
- It doesn't matter. We're full.

650
00:45:42,428 --> 00:45:44,304
- Turn around.
- Know who you're fucking with?

651
00:45:44,468 --> 00:45:47,457
- Moss Side, you fucking, frigging...
- I don't give a fuck where you're from.

652
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:50,737
- Now fuck off.
- That's the way you want it?

653
00:45:50,908 --> 00:45:52,937
- Get out.
- I'll be seeing you later, mate.

654
00:45:53,068 --> 00:45:54,704
- Eh, I'm here all night.
- Fuck you.

655
00:45:54,908 --> 00:45:55,857
- Yeah.
- Fuck you.

656
00:45:56,028 --> 00:45:58,177
Love to. See you later.

657
00:45:59,149 --> 00:46:01,265
Sorry about that, guys.
Come on. Enjoy your night.

658
00:46:01,428 --> 00:46:03,425
- Moss Side kids are back.
- I know. I seen 'em.

659
00:46:03,588 --> 00:46:05,498
It's worse inside.
They're all over the place.

660
00:46:05,669 --> 00:46:08,025
- Just need more security.
- No, Matt, it's more than that.

661
00:46:08,229 --> 00:46:11,022
- We've lost control of the door.
- Don't worry. It's not your problem.

662
00:46:11,229 --> 00:46:13,586
Don't talk to me
like I'm a fucking child.

663
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:19,225
Go on, you fucking prick!

664
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:31,186
Someone's pissed someone off
in the queue, they've had a talking to,

665
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,420
it's all been sorted.

666
00:46:32,550 --> 00:46:35,420
Dylan, it's got fuck all to do with
the kids in the queue and you know it.

667
00:46:35,591 --> 00:46:37,620
The people Maurice is letting in
are the problem.

668
00:46:37,791 --> 00:46:41,261
- Has to be done to keep the peace.
- That's not really working out, is it?

669
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:44,540
It's not safe for us to deal any more.
It's fucking dangerous.

670
00:46:44,712 --> 00:46:48,105
Should we just wait until someone gets
killed while our club's going to shit?

671
00:46:49,111 --> 00:46:53,388
I'll stop you there, Claire.
It's our club, our business.

672
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:55,865
Matt, let's not fuck it off
at the first sign of trouble.

673
00:46:55,991 --> 00:46:58,305
It's barely the Wild friggin' West,
is it?

674
00:46:58,472 --> 00:47:02,989
Will you listen to yourself, Dylan?
I can't believe we're even discussing this.

675
00:47:03,192 --> 00:47:05,222
You've completely forgotten
what this is about.

676
00:47:05,352 --> 00:47:08,025
What's that, then, peace and love?
All right, then, Moonbeam.

677
00:47:08,153 --> 00:47:10,466
I nearly got shot, Dylan,
and so did Matt.

678
00:47:10,672 --> 00:47:13,345
So did Maurice. So did Nigel.
I haven't heard them whinge the once.

679
00:47:13,553 --> 00:47:16,586
Oi! Can you just stop?

680
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:18,982
Why are you arsed, man?

681
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:22,950
You said it yourself, she's just a mate
that lets you stick your dick in her.

682
00:47:31,034 --> 00:47:34,831
Yeah. It's your club.
Just leave you to it.

683
00:47:36,834 --> 00:47:37,903
Wee Man.

684
00:47:38,035 --> 00:47:41,505
Fucking hell,
what is this♪ The miserable gang?

685
00:47:41,674 --> 00:47:43,911
Fuck this. I'm off for a curry, man.

686
00:48:21,517 --> 00:48:23,710
- Hello?
- It's me.

687
00:48:25,037 --> 00:48:27,034
What do you want, Matt?

688
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:28,953
I really need to talk to you.

689
00:48:29,117 --> 00:48:33,231
I was hoping you were gonna
come down to the club tomorrow night.

690
00:48:33,398 --> 00:48:36,431
I think it's better if I just stay away.

691
00:48:36,598 --> 00:48:38,595
Besides, it's your club anyway.

692
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:58,395
Get your money ready.
Keep 'em flowing, lads.

693
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,709
Keep 'em flowing. Here we go.

694
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:28,274
Right, if anybody touches anybody with
them fucking bats other than security,

695
00:49:28,441 --> 00:49:29,718
you're a fucking dead man.

696
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:31,470
Other than that, fucking have it!

697
00:49:50,922 --> 00:49:52,591
All right, lad♪ All right, mate?

698
00:50:07,964 --> 00:50:10,953
Now, don't speak. Just listen.

699
00:50:11,163 --> 00:50:13,640
That was just reminding
the little fuckers that we're here now

700
00:50:13,804 --> 00:50:15,113
and it's time for them to leave.

701
00:50:15,284 --> 00:50:17,957
They'll turn this place into
a battle ground if you're not careful.

702
00:50:18,123 --> 00:50:19,313
That's not good for business.

703
00:50:20,644 --> 00:50:23,557
I heard that you had some bother
with somebody letting shots off

704
00:50:23,764 --> 00:50:25,116
outside your club the other day.

705
00:50:25,284 --> 00:50:29,474
Now, we can't have that,
and with us on the door, you won't.

706
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:31,717
We'll keep the dickheads
and the dibble away.

707
00:50:31,885 --> 00:50:35,322
Also we'll make sure
that only top-quality drugs get in here.

708
00:50:35,485 --> 00:50:37,798
You can't have kids falling dead
down on your dance floor.

709
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:40,162
Again, that ain't good for business.

710
00:50:40,326 --> 00:50:43,315
We'll turn the place into a fortress.

711
00:50:43,446 --> 00:50:46,315
Other crews'll leave you alone
and we'll, what, we'll take like...

712
00:50:46,486 --> 00:50:48,722
- 25.
- .. .25 %% of the door.

713
00:50:48,886 --> 00:50:51,559
Happy days.

714
00:50:51,725 --> 00:50:53,678
It is, of course, your decision,

715
00:50:53,806 --> 00:50:56,555
but if you do open these doors again
without letting me know,

716
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:58,562
I swear to God
I will burn this building down

717
00:50:58,726 --> 00:51:01,595
with each and every fucker inside it,
do you get me?

718
00:51:04,486 --> 00:51:08,316
Well, fucking hell, lads, relax.
We can make this work.

719
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,723
If it wasn't me stood here,
it'd be some other dickhead,

720
00:51:10,887 --> 00:51:13,757
and he might be
a right nasty little cunt.

721
00:51:15,688 --> 00:51:18,121
Let's be mates, yeah?

722
00:51:18,328 --> 00:51:20,325
Quality.

723
00:51:22,808 --> 00:51:25,558
It was lovely seeing you again.

724
00:51:29,528 --> 00:51:32,037
- We're gone.
- Sound. I'll bell you tomorrow, boys.

725
00:51:32,208 --> 00:51:35,645
Don't fucking bother.
We didn't sign up for this shit, lads.

726
00:51:35,808 --> 00:51:37,761
Sorry, kid.

727
00:51:46,649 --> 00:51:48,646
What?!

728
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,242
Yeah, it's over, mate.

729
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:05,887
Did you not listen
to what he was just saying?

730
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:08,847
We've come so far
from what we set out to do.

731
00:52:09,971 --> 00:52:12,763
Have a party, yeah, have a party.

732
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,167
And... and. .. and make a few quid.

733
00:52:17,091 --> 00:52:20,965
I can't even remember the last time
I had a good time here. It's fucked.

734
00:52:21,132 --> 00:52:25,769
Well, that's the point, Matt.
It's our jobs now. It's a career.

735
00:52:25,932 --> 00:52:28,124
We are acid house pioneers, man.

736
00:52:28,291 --> 00:52:31,325
It's a business,
and John can help us out.

737
00:52:31,492 --> 00:52:34,361
Business, yeah?
You wanna talk about business?

738
00:52:34,532 --> 00:52:36,681
All right, how much money
did we make this week, mate?

739
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:39,562
- Who booked the DJs?
- You.

740
00:52:39,692 --> 00:52:41,568
- Who sorted out the flyers?
- You did, yeah.

741
00:52:41,732 --> 00:52:45,049
How much you put up your nose?
Wake up, Dylan. That man's a lunatic!

742
00:52:45,213 --> 00:52:46,205
What do you suggest?

743
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:51,047
And before you say it, no, I ain't going
back to robbing fucking fag machines!

744
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,170
Let's just talk to him, Matt.

745
00:52:57,973 --> 00:53:00,166
Let's just have a word.

746
00:53:02,334 --> 00:53:04,330
Come on.

747
00:53:06,054 --> 00:53:08,051
Come here.

748
00:53:09,294 --> 00:53:10,963
Come here.

749
00:53:11,134 --> 00:53:13,284
No use falling out, Matt, is there?

750
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:17,964
We'll have a business meeting.

751
00:53:18,614 --> 00:53:20,611
Pat me back. I'm patting yours.

752
00:53:22,695 --> 00:53:24,484
Do you feel better?

753
00:53:34,815 --> 00:53:36,725
You never leave
the dance floor to deal.

754
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:40,969
And you never leave the premises
without settling up, right?

755
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:42,924
Yeah, got it, mate, yeah.

756
00:53:43,056 --> 00:53:44,649
If you run out of what you're selling,

757
00:53:44,816 --> 00:53:46,725
go to Bigfoot
and he'll send a runner for you.

758
00:53:46,896 --> 00:53:49,253
We keep nothing on the premises.

759
00:53:49,417 --> 00:53:51,413
OK?

760
00:53:52,577 --> 00:53:56,451
- Yeah, cool, mate. Sorted.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, cool, cool.

761
00:54:01,137 --> 00:54:03,767
We're going.

762
00:54:04,577 --> 00:54:06,814
- Have you seen her?
- Would you leave her alone?

763
00:54:06,978 --> 00:54:08,691
Just trying to make sure
she's all right.

764
00:54:08,817 --> 00:54:12,494
She's better off without you, actually,
so you're gonna have to jog on.

765
00:54:12,657 --> 00:54:14,414
Everything OK, lads?

766
00:54:14,578 --> 00:54:16,051
- Oh, yeah, bob on, John.
- Yeah.

767
00:54:16,218 --> 00:54:18,651
Well, make sure you close the door
on the way out, will you?

768
00:54:26,819 --> 00:54:30,015
- He is one dim-witted little tosser.
- Dickhead. Dickhead.

769
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,335
This'll work, mate,
with John on side, I'm telling you.

770
00:54:38,499 --> 00:54:40,168
- Yeah♪ How's that?
- Well, look at 'em.

771
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,853
Eh, eh, eh, what's the story with
the gobshite DJ who's taken my spot?

772
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,850
That's only for the first few hours.
He plays all that hardcore shit.

773
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:50,730
- John and his boys, they're into it.
- You know what♪ I've had enough.

774
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:53,410
- You're taking the piss, man.
- Fuck this.

775
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,176
Where are you off?

776
00:54:55,381 --> 00:54:57,453
Look, you are, man,
and him, John the Twat.

777
00:54:57,621 --> 00:54:59,650
It's my...
I brought these people, not him.

778
00:54:59,821 --> 00:55:01,731
I can't be asked with you, man.
You're in a mood.

779
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,977
Well, I am in a mood, yeah.
I brought style to this place.

780
00:55:05,141 --> 00:55:07,650
And the styluses! Fuck.

781
00:55:07,861 --> 00:55:09,574
You're a wanker, mate!

782
00:55:09,781 --> 00:55:13,175
Do you like this?
Do you like this music?

783
00:55:13,301 --> 00:55:14,774
Do you...♪ Fucking...

784
00:55:14,941 --> 00:55:17,854
Aw, look at you, you f...

785
00:55:20,182 --> 00:55:22,331
Unbelievable.

786
00:56:40,667 --> 00:56:42,423
- Hiya. You all right?
- All right?

787
00:56:42,587 --> 00:56:44,583
Cheers.

788
00:56:47,827 --> 00:56:49,616
- That's £2.
- Claire...

789
00:56:49,747 --> 00:56:52,901
- I'm not finished here, thanks.
- All right, mate.

790
00:56:53,068 --> 00:56:55,741
- Claire. ..
- Mate, mate, mate, there's a line.

791
00:56:55,908 --> 00:56:58,177
- You don't have a bag?
- I don't have a bag. Sorry.

792
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,180
Claire, I'm really sorry
for being a prick.

793
00:57:00,348 --> 00:57:02,737
That's not much of an apology.

794
00:57:02,908 --> 00:57:03,977
Hiya. You all right?

795
00:57:04,148 --> 00:57:06,985
And for what Dylan said,
'cause he quoted me bang out of context.

796
00:57:07,148 --> 00:57:09,417
What, that I'm just a bird
that lets you fuck her?

797
00:57:11,149 --> 00:57:12,817
- That's £2.
- That's not what I said.

798
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:16,586
What did you say?

799
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:21,262
I said that we were really great mates,
with benefits.

800
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:23,382
With what?

801
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:26,382
And that we were really close and that.

802
00:57:26,589 --> 00:57:28,378
Tosser.

803
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:34,983
I thought maybe
you'd gone home or something.

804
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,419
- I thought about it.
- Why didn't you?

805
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,187
- Something came up.
- What?

806
00:57:52,551 --> 00:57:53,664
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

807
00:57:54,911 --> 00:57:57,300
Cheers.

808
00:57:58,512 --> 00:58:04,502
So, like we said, 25 %% of the door for me
and the rest is for you.

809
00:58:07,232 --> 00:58:10,341
You know, you should think about
investing in a new motor with that.

810
00:58:10,512 --> 00:58:13,829
Summat really classy.
Let them know you've arrived.

811
00:58:13,952 --> 00:58:17,869
Bigfoot knows a guy.
Don't you♪ You could help him out.

812
00:58:19,272 --> 00:58:25,186
Nice one. Oh, yeah, I've got Wee Man
and Sarah's money for you.

813
00:58:26,073 --> 00:58:27,502
Uh...

814
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:35,622
Every fucker's happy, then, yeah?

815
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:39,266
Come in.

816
00:58:40,474 --> 00:58:43,387
Just wanted to talk to Dylan.

817
00:58:45,354 --> 00:58:48,267
- Go on, then.
- In private.

818
00:58:48,435 --> 00:58:52,232
Surely whatever you can say
to Dylan, you can say to the rest of us.

819
00:58:52,355 --> 00:58:55,912
- I mean, we're all mates.
- No, it's all right.

820
00:58:56,075 --> 00:58:58,748
- Well, is there a problem?
- No.

821
00:58:58,915 --> 00:59:01,424
Well, stop fannying around, then.
Come and have a drink.

822
00:59:03,516 --> 00:59:05,512
I'm all good, thanks.

823
00:59:10,516 --> 00:59:12,513
We're all good.

824
00:59:14,436 --> 00:59:16,628
- Have a good night, yeah?
- How much have you got?

825
00:59:16,756 --> 00:59:18,589
All right, mate?

826
00:59:18,716 --> 00:59:23,550
Babe, have you got more money?
It's not a chemist, yeah♪ No refunds.

827
00:59:24,276 --> 00:59:26,426
Mate, here you are.

828
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,269
Cheers, mate. Look, mate,
you're gonna have to jog on, yeah?

829
00:59:29,437 --> 00:59:32,067
- Have a good night.
- Not tonight, mate. Sorry about that.

830
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:35,870
- Have you grown a ball sack yet?
- Anyway, nothing?

831
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:38,995
Sorry, mate, it's a busy night, pal.
I'm sorry.

832
00:59:39,757 --> 00:59:41,710
- Can you do us 80?
- 18?

833
00:59:41,878 --> 00:59:45,468
- 80, man. There's loads of us.
- 80♪ Fucking hell.

834
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:46,987
- Sarah. Sarah.
- What?

835
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:50,514
- He wants 80.
- 80♪ Fucking students.

836
00:59:50,678 --> 00:59:53,308
You'll have to hang on.
We've gotta count 'em yet.

837
00:59:53,478 --> 00:59:55,387
- How many do you want?
- Can we do this outside?

838
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:59,432
- I've got everyone's money, man.
- No, mate, I can't, mate, I can't.

839
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:03,069
- Come on. I've got everyone's money.
- All right, then.

840
01:00:03,999 --> 01:00:07,557
Wee Man! Fuck's sake.

841
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,349
Look, mate, look, love you.
I'm back in five, yeah♪ Yeah?

842
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,516
Love you. I love you.

843
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:16,756
Fucking hell, mate,
where are you taking me here?

844
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:20,749
What is this now?

845
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,878
Gonna have to do it here,
mate. I can't go any further.

846
01:00:24,041 --> 01:00:27,434
How many was it♪ 80, yeah?

847
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:29,757
Wee Man, run!

848
01:00:44,602 --> 01:00:47,395
- You all right, chap?
- I just came from the hospital.

849
01:00:49,082 --> 01:00:51,078
Haven't you heard about Wee Man?

850
01:01:14,323 --> 01:01:15,316
Wee Man!

851
01:01:15,523 --> 01:01:17,520
Fuck.

852
01:01:19,083 --> 01:01:21,397
Yeah, fuck.

853
01:01:23,524 --> 01:01:27,473
Listen, mate... I want out.

854
01:01:27,644 --> 01:01:29,913
Actually, I am out, yeah?

855
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:32,353
If you had any sense,
you'd do the same.

856
01:01:34,044 --> 01:01:36,401
- We can't do that, Matthew.
- Why not?

857
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:38,241
Because John'll go mad for a start.

858
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:40,401
He's already been on at me
as to where you've been.

859
01:01:40,565 --> 01:01:42,682
Tell him he can keep the club,
burn it down if he wants.

860
01:01:42,845 --> 01:01:45,037
I'm not gonna do that.
It's everything I've fucking got.

861
01:01:45,205 --> 01:01:47,519
Well, keep it, then.
I want my life back.

862
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:50,241
What life, Matthew?
We had fuck all, man.

863
01:01:50,365 --> 01:01:52,754
We were all right.

864
01:01:52,965 --> 01:01:54,482
You stay away from our friends as well,

865
01:01:54,646 --> 01:01:57,875
'cause you're a fucking liability
and everything you touch turns to shite!

866
01:01:58,046 --> 01:02:00,555
Nothing to do with the fact
that I fucked Claire before you did?

867
01:02:00,726 --> 01:02:03,923
- You...
- Go on, then, mate. Go on.

868
01:02:04,726 --> 01:02:07,399
- Go on.
- You're not fucking worth it, mate.

869
01:02:09,526 --> 01:02:11,719
You don't want John
coming for you, Matt, man.

870
01:02:29,248 --> 01:02:30,884
Fuck. Ball.

871
01:02:35,088 --> 01:02:38,481
What happened with your mate,
it's, um... well, it's regrettable,

872
01:02:38,648 --> 01:02:41,802
but they brought it on themselves.

873
01:02:41,968 --> 01:02:43,517
They broke the rules.

874
01:02:46,448 --> 01:02:49,482
That is fucking beautiful.
Fucking beautiful.

875
01:02:50,769 --> 01:02:52,842
Yeah, yeah, good shot, John.

876
01:03:04,610 --> 01:03:09,083
The problem is I'm down
thousands of pills and a pile of dough.

877
01:03:13,011 --> 01:03:14,920
Fuck.

878
01:03:17,091 --> 01:03:21,728
Now, normally I'd be going to the guy
before he could walk again,

879
01:03:21,891 --> 01:03:23,801
but I'm not gonna do that.

880
01:03:26,291 --> 01:03:28,484
I'm coming to you.

881
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:31,445
- John, I...
- Don't speak. Just listen.

882
01:03:31,611 --> 01:03:32,801
You owe me 20 grand.

883
01:03:32,971 --> 01:03:38,242
But seeing as we're mates, I'll only
charge you 10 % interest a day, right?

884
01:03:38,411 --> 01:03:40,168
You've got till the end of the week
to pay me

885
01:03:40,332 --> 01:03:44,488
or I might start getting restless,
and you don't want that, right?

886
01:03:53,092 --> 01:03:55,885
You've reached the Rave Control.

887
01:03:56,053 --> 01:03:57,046
Ooh!

888
01:03:58,973 --> 01:04:05,923
I'm Matt... Matt,
and he's the one, the only...

889
01:04:06,094 --> 01:04:07,087
Dylan.

890
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:09,450
I'm afraid we can't come
to the phone right now.

891
01:04:09,614 --> 01:04:10,803
'Cause we're off our heads.

892
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:14,283
But leave a message
after the tone, tone, tone, tone, tone.

893
01:04:14,454 --> 01:04:15,807
Turn it off!

894
01:04:30,895 --> 01:04:33,568
Yeah, uh, police, please.

895
01:04:48,256 --> 01:04:51,529
It's doctor whatshisface's orders,
soft foods only.

896
01:04:56,937 --> 01:05:00,013
- Nice room.
- Yeah, Peanut sorted us out.

897
01:05:00,217 --> 01:05:04,330
- Junkie doctor, owes me one.
- Right.

898
01:05:08,017 --> 01:05:09,130
You OK?

899
01:05:11,577 --> 01:05:13,487
Ey up.

900
01:05:13,658 --> 01:05:18,971
- So you've taken him back, then?
- Yeah. On a trial basis.

901
01:05:20,658 --> 01:05:22,327
So he knows?

902
01:05:22,498 --> 01:05:24,527
- Yeah, he knows.
- What did he say?

903
01:05:24,698 --> 01:05:27,054
You're pregnant♪ How did that happen?

904
01:05:27,218 --> 01:05:29,575
- You cheeky fucking bastard!
- I never said that.

905
01:05:29,739 --> 01:05:33,088
- Tell her what I actually said.
- That's what I thought he'd say.

906
01:05:33,259 --> 01:05:35,092
What he actually said was...

907
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:36,571
We'll do it, I promise.

908
01:05:36,779 --> 01:05:38,851
The club and the drugs,
we'll knock it on the head,

909
01:05:38,979 --> 01:05:40,692
and... and we'll do it together.

910
01:05:40,860 --> 01:05:42,692
- Quitting drugs?
- Shut up, you.

911
01:05:42,859 --> 01:05:47,649
Right, if you fuck this up,
I will make sure you end up like him.

912
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:51,290
- Cheers, mate. I'll bear that in mind.
- So you're really quitting drugs?

913
01:05:51,459 --> 01:05:54,776
Yes, Peanut.
I'm sorry if that affects sales.

914
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,057
Bigfoot! Get your fucking hands off me!

915
01:06:08,621 --> 01:06:12,494
Oh, my God. We're having a fucking baby!

916
01:06:17,301 --> 01:06:19,014
It's great, innit?

917
01:06:25,302 --> 01:06:29,012
Hospital food's always shit,
so I brought you some proper gear.

918
01:06:34,702 --> 01:06:37,452
It's times like this
when you really need your mates.

919
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,772
You seen much of them, your mates?

920
01:06:41,983 --> 01:06:46,216
Only I was looking for Matt
and Dickhead Dylan.

921
01:06:46,343 --> 01:06:48,896
Need to have a word with 'em, urgent.

922
01:06:49,063 --> 01:06:51,180
- They've not been here.
- I was asking him.

923
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:57,380
No.

924
01:07:03,064 --> 01:07:05,136
Fucking hell, lad.
You need the toilet?

925
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:07,738
There's a handicapped one
out there for you.

926
01:07:14,865 --> 01:07:19,218
Well, if you do see them,
let them know I'm looking for 'em.

927
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:23,102
Oh, and one more bit of news
to lift your spirits.

928
01:07:23,306 --> 01:07:25,302
It was my lads that robbed you
and took your pills,

929
01:07:25,466 --> 01:07:28,619
so you two don't need to worry
about that any more, do you?

930
01:07:28,786 --> 01:07:31,699
That's my gift to you, that,
peace of mind.

931
01:07:46,867 --> 01:07:48,820
Money's in the drum.
Money's in the drum.

932
01:07:48,986 --> 01:07:51,616
- Oh, fuck me!
- Fuck!

933
01:07:51,787 --> 01:07:53,697
Why the fuck is John
looking for you and Matt?

934
01:07:53,827 --> 01:07:56,303
- Claire, he thinks I owe him money.
- Well, pay him, then.

935
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:58,497
I haven't got that kind
of fucking money. I'm skint.

936
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:00,017
Sort it out. Sort it out.

937
01:08:00,188 --> 01:08:03,145
- He wants to tear my fucking head off.
- You're fucked, then, aren't you?

938
01:08:03,308 --> 01:08:05,457
- You're fucked an' all!
- What the fuck have I done?

939
01:08:05,628 --> 01:08:07,264
From the fucking beginning, I said,

940
01:08:07,468 --> 01:08:09,498
"Don't walk out
without clearing it with him."

941
01:08:09,628 --> 01:08:11,025
We wouldn't be in this mess

942
01:08:11,228 --> 01:08:14,665
if you hadn't try to play
Barry fucking Big Bollocks.

943
01:08:14,828 --> 01:08:19,662
It's him. It's John. It's fucking John!
He's coming right now!

944
01:08:19,868 --> 01:08:22,018
- Bye-bye!
- Out the back!

945
01:08:22,189 --> 01:08:25,101
- You're on your own now.
- I proper fucked up, I know I did.

946
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:28,379
- I ain't got nowhere else to go, man.
- Give a shit!

947
01:08:28,590 --> 01:08:34,547
- Matt, we gotta take him with us.
- Thank you. Where are you going?

948
01:09:13,632 --> 01:09:15,105
Wakey, wakey.

949
01:09:15,272 --> 01:09:17,269
Fucking hell.

950
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:27,545
- Give us your hand, then.
- What?

951
01:09:27,713 --> 01:09:29,426
We'll be less targeted.
Give us your hand.

952
01:09:29,553 --> 01:09:31,702
- I'm not comfortable with that, man.
- Don't be shy.

953
01:09:31,913 --> 01:09:32,906
Stop touching me.

954
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:34,986
Are you sure about this?

955
01:09:35,153 --> 01:09:36,866
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

956
01:09:37,034 --> 01:09:38,943
It's not like he's not gonna
sort it out himself.

957
01:09:39,113 --> 01:09:40,270
- John the Twat.
- Shit.

958
01:09:40,434 --> 01:09:41,503
- Run, run, run,
- Shut up.

959
01:09:41,674 --> 01:09:43,627
- He's there, he's there.
- It's a fucking. ..

960
01:09:43,793 --> 01:09:45,669
You're a knobhead.
You're a fully fledged...

961
01:09:45,833 --> 01:09:49,903
- You should have seen your face.
- You're an ambitious knobhead.

962
01:09:50,114 --> 01:09:52,263
- A real ambitious knobhead.
- You were so scared.

963
01:09:52,434 --> 01:09:56,624
You know, he's never gonna learn.
Just gotta sort him out.

964
01:09:58,994 --> 01:10:02,028
- You should give us that back, man.
- It's a worthy cause, mate.

965
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:04,904
- I'm on the friggin' run here.
- Well, I suppose.

966
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,464
Do you want me dead?

967
01:10:10,955 --> 01:10:13,431
- Hey!
- Here they are, Bonnie and Clyde.

968
01:10:13,595 --> 01:10:15,865
- Good to see you.
- You all right?

969
01:10:16,076 --> 01:10:19,272
Closely followed
by Tweedledum and Tweedledick.

970
01:10:19,435 --> 01:10:23,025
- Lads!
- Proper prostitutes, Matthew, man!

971
01:10:23,196 --> 01:10:25,193
Come on.

972
01:10:25,356 --> 01:10:27,309
Bye.

973
01:10:28,717 --> 01:10:32,514
Ladies and gentleman, welcome to Ze Dam.

974
01:10:33,836 --> 01:10:35,669
- After you, mate.
- All right, Gaz, my old son.

975
01:10:35,797 --> 01:10:38,993
- Eh, come on.
- All right♪ Come on.

976
01:13:15,927 --> 01:13:18,316
- Where are we going?
- Surprise, mate.

977
01:13:19,727 --> 01:13:22,596
Do us a favour, put these on, yeah?

978
01:13:22,767 --> 01:13:25,080
Why?

979
01:13:25,287 --> 01:13:27,916
Trust me. You'll see.
Gonna sort you right out.

980
01:13:28,127 --> 01:13:29,480
- Bondage?
- Something like that.

981
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:33,404
I love this city.

982
01:13:37,367 --> 01:13:39,320
Come on, here we are.

983
01:13:44,688 --> 01:13:47,558
- It's a bit seedy, Matt.
- Come on, mate.

984
01:13:49,008 --> 01:13:51,125
- Hello, Dylan.
- Whoa! Fuck, Matt!

985
01:13:51,328 --> 01:13:53,204
Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt!
Fucking hell, man!

986
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:56,766
- Have you not told him yet?
- Let's get this over and done with.

987
01:13:58,009 --> 01:14:01,206
- There's your money.
- What the fuck's going on here, boys?

988
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:03,802
- See you later.
- What the fuck's going on, lads?

989
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:06,719
- It's the only way, mate, trust me.
- Gaz, Gaz, Gaz, Gaz.

990
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:09,122
- Is it all there?
- 30 grand. Count it if you want.

991
01:14:09,329 --> 01:14:13,007
I know you're not stupid enough
to fuck me over. Not like this dickhead.

992
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:16,206
- You knew he was down here, Matt?
- It's done, yeah?

993
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:19,927
- You stay away from me and Claire.
- Yeah. You've paid for that privilege.

994
01:14:20,090 --> 01:14:23,407
But you, oh, you're totally fucked now.

995
01:14:23,570 --> 01:14:25,043
- John, man.
- Right!

996
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:28,047
No, no, no, John, John, John,
he's paid you the fucking money.

997
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:29,960
Dylan!

998
01:14:30,931 --> 01:14:33,320
He's paid for it.
You haven't paid me.

999
01:14:34,811 --> 01:14:36,927
It's not just the money
that I really want, you know.

1000
01:14:37,091 --> 01:14:39,600
It's you, mate. You're the real prize.

1001
01:14:40,932 --> 01:14:43,168
You're not gonna fucking do owt, Matt?
Say summat!

1002
01:14:43,372 --> 01:14:45,685
Say what?
That I'm better off without you?

1003
01:14:45,852 --> 01:14:47,009
You're dead to me!

1004
01:14:50,012 --> 01:14:53,046
- Oh, fucking...
- Aw.

1005
01:14:53,212 --> 01:14:55,361
It doesn't sound like
he's in the mood to talk, Matt.

1006
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:58,249
You have a nice life, mate, yeah?

1007
01:14:58,893 --> 01:14:59,885
Hey!

1008
01:15:02,093 --> 01:15:04,362
Just me and you, sunshine.

1009
01:15:25,694 --> 01:15:27,647
Well?

1010
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:30,128
Yeah, it's done.

1011
01:15:52,136 --> 01:15:55,933
Oh, you fucking horrible,
horrible bastard, Matthew!

1012
01:15:56,056 --> 01:15:58,686
- Untie me, Gaz. Untie me.
- Hey, hey...

1013
01:15:58,896 --> 01:16:01,405
Right! You lot better
think about making a move.

1014
01:16:01,577 --> 01:16:04,250
- Yeah, mate.
- Right, now, don't forget this one.

1015
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:07,134
Don't know what to say, mate.

1016
01:16:07,337 --> 01:16:09,529
Don't worry. He had it coming anyway.

1017
01:16:09,697 --> 01:16:12,851
Oh. .. I'll see you for the next one?

1018
01:16:12,977 --> 01:16:14,330
- Yeah.
- See you, mate.

1019
01:16:14,498 --> 01:16:16,407
I really fucking thought
you'd done me in there.

1020
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:18,574
- That was the plan, wasn't it?
- That was the plan?

1021
01:16:18,697 --> 01:16:20,366
- Yeah.
- Fucking lovely.

1022
01:16:20,498 --> 01:16:22,134
You didn't think of telling me, did you?

1023
01:16:22,337 --> 01:16:24,933
- You'd have fucked it up, wouldn't you?
- Yes!

1024
01:16:25,097 --> 01:16:29,167
- Come on.
- No, hold on. What's going on?

1025
01:16:29,338 --> 01:16:31,934
Did you know?
Oi, did you know, Claire?

1026
01:16:32,098 --> 01:16:34,454
- Yep.
- Oh!

1027
01:16:34,578 --> 01:16:36,094
- Did you know?
- Know what?

1028
01:16:36,299 --> 01:16:38,012
What's everyone talking about?

1029
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,336
I've never been so scared
in all my life, Matthew!

1030
01:16:40,499 --> 01:16:42,375
What♪ What has happened here?

1031
01:16:42,539 --> 01:16:45,288
Will someone please tell me
what I missed?

1032
01:16:50,219 --> 01:16:53,732
That's gotta be a right kick in the
bollocks, that, being set up by a mate.

1033
01:16:53,899 --> 01:16:56,692
Still, life goes on, doesn't it?

1034
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:01,573
Well, not for you, of course,
but for me.

1035
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:04,929
I've got all this lovely bloody money
to spend, haven't I?

1036
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,650
What the fuck?

1037
01:17:17,861 --> 01:17:19,858
What the fuck♪ Who the fucking hell?

1038
01:17:43,582 --> 01:17:48,100
So, Biggie, right, he's come out of
nowhere like some triple-size ninja.

1039
01:17:48,303 --> 01:17:50,779
That's big, man.

1040
01:17:50,943 --> 01:17:56,060
And the plan, right,
so, basically, was to use me as bait?

1041
01:17:57,383 --> 01:17:59,380
Yeah.

1042
01:18:00,263 --> 01:18:02,412
- But it worked.
- You don't know that, though, do you?

1043
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:05,781
Because he could just recover
and come for us all.

1044
01:18:05,944 --> 01:18:09,140
But he won't, mate, 'cause it's over.

1045
01:18:10,104 --> 01:18:11,773
Trust me.

1046
01:18:15,784 --> 01:18:18,414
Thank you, then. I mean that.

1047
01:18:20,785 --> 01:18:24,975
- I am properly sorry, mate.
- For which bit?

1048
01:18:27,825 --> 01:18:30,498
- All of it.
- Yeah.

1049
01:18:38,545 --> 01:18:40,542
Come here, brother.

1050
01:18:42,626 --> 01:18:45,016
I enjoyed every minute, you mad bastard.

1051
01:18:46,226 --> 01:18:49,139
- I love you, man.
- Yeah, me an' all.

1052
01:18:50,066 --> 01:18:53,623
Claire, Claire, I... I can't not...

1053
01:18:53,786 --> 01:18:58,304
I was well out of line to you, Claire.
Bang out of order.

1054
01:19:01,507 --> 01:19:03,460
He's lucky to have
anything to do with you.

1055
01:19:06,387 --> 01:19:08,384
I'm really, really sorry, Claire.

1056
01:19:10,868 --> 01:19:12,778
Thanks, Dylan.

1057
01:19:12,947 --> 01:19:15,817
- Hey, you get him home, all right?
- What?

1058
01:19:15,988 --> 01:19:17,461
Yeah.

1059
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:23,345
Right, then, just before we go home,
speed, Es, mushrooms, live sex show.

1060
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:35,266
- I don't wanna go back.
- Me neither.

1061
01:19:36,429 --> 01:19:39,778
- I mean it, though.
- So do I.

1062
01:19:43,269 --> 01:19:45,986
What, even if I get skint again?

1063
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:49,019
To be honest,
I think I prefer you with no money.

1064
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:50,779
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

1065
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,983
- We might have a problem, then.
- Why?

1066
01:19:55,151 --> 01:19:57,267
- Just a small issue.
- What?

1067
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,427
We might have to talk about it.

1068
01:20:02,271 --> 01:20:03,264
Matt.

1069
01:20:03,391 --> 01:20:05,540
- Make sure you close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?

1070
01:20:05,711 --> 01:20:07,708
Yeah.

1071
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:11,421
- Right, eyes closed, yeah?
- They're closed.

1072
01:20:11,591 --> 01:20:13,741
Keep 'em closed. Keep 'em closed.

1073
01:20:13,911 --> 01:20:16,104
Wait for it. Wait for it.

1074
01:20:18,712 --> 01:20:21,101
Open 'em.

1075
01:20:21,232 --> 01:20:23,229
We're loaded!

1076
01:20:26,152 --> 01:20:28,661
You know when things started
getting heavy in the club?

1077
01:20:28,792 --> 01:20:33,866
I started stashing it away,
as a kind of, um, rave pension.

1078
01:20:34,032 --> 01:20:37,742
I thought it would come in handy
for... for... for the kid.

1079
01:20:41,033 --> 01:20:42,549
So what do you think?

1080
01:20:44,834 --> 01:20:46,831
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

1081
01:20:59,874 --> 01:21:03,671
Tribes die
and then they start again,

1082
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:05,623
and so it goes.

1083
01:21:05,795 --> 01:21:07,792
The cycle continues.

1084
01:21:08,675 --> 01:21:10,792
It's how we survive.

1085
01:21:10,915 --> 01:21:13,031
And we had survived.

1086
01:21:39,917 --> 01:21:42,066
- Captain, you're on in five...
- What?

1087
01:21:42,237 --> 01:21:43,349
- ...four...
- Live?

1088
01:21:43,557 --> 01:21:44,953
- ...three...
- Now?

1089
01:21:45,117 --> 01:21:46,153
- ...two...
- No!

1090
01:21:46,357 --> 01:21:48,267
-. ..one.
- This is not good!

1091
01:21:48,437 --> 01:21:51,547
Yo-ho-ho, Mancunia.

1092
01:21:51,717 --> 01:21:56,507
Hoist the Jolly Roger,
for the Captain is back.

1093
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:58,151
Did you miss me?

1094
01:21:58,318 --> 01:22:00,228
Now bigger and better than ever,

1095
01:22:00,398 --> 01:22:05,112
thanks to an anonymous donation
from a devoted listener.

1096
01:22:05,278 --> 01:22:08,835
This one goes out to you, mate.

1097
01:22:08,958 --> 01:22:10,028

1098
01:22:14,919 --> 01:22:17,756
Oh, yes!

1099
01:22:53,241 --> 01:22:56,951
What do you mean, I've
gotta read this out♪ What♪ Local news?

1100
01:22:57,121 --> 01:22:59,991
This isn't Newsround, man.
Do I look like John Craven?

1101
01:23:00,162 --> 01:23:04,231
No, don't answer that.
Anyway, gotta read out some local news.

1102
01:23:04,402 --> 01:23:07,271
Special bingo night tonight.

1103
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:10,476
What the fuck♪ Are old ladies
listening to this or what?

1104
01:23:10,642 --> 01:23:15,312

It's number 30.

1105

- Dirty swine.

1107
01:23:25,363 --> 01:23:27,480
What did you just say there, my ducky?

1108
01:23:27,603 --> 01:23:29,479
- House!
- House, you say?

1109
01:23:30,683 --> 01:23:31,796
Drop it,Peanut
