A subtitle made possible by R3V0LV3R.

5
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:10,502
Keep those cameras away.

6
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,542
How you feelin', sweetie pie?

7
00:03:26,119 --> 00:03:28,519
Well, my head isn't so hot anymore.

8
00:03:30,056 --> 00:03:31,284
Willie...

9
00:03:33,793 --> 00:03:36,819
I swear to God,
they told me you were a dead man.

10
00:03:36,963 --> 00:03:38,863
I'm right here, honey.

11
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,601
Can we get outta here, Dick?

12
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:45,798
Please?

13
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:49,575
You look real nice, Dick.

14
00:03:51,378 --> 00:03:53,243
Let's play a game
while we wait, huh?

15
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,574
Do you know where Em is?

16
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:07,716
Let's say the game is...

17
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:12,456
...you can go any place, anytime,

18
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,534
as long as you say it out loud to me.

19
00:04:16,336 --> 00:04:19,203
I don't need
to be playin' that game anymore.

20
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:21,134
Go ahead.

21
00:04:32,586 --> 00:04:33,644
Shit!

22
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:38,758
Go ahead.

23
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,591
Tell me what went wrong.

24
00:04:44,598 --> 00:04:46,793
All I'll say is...

25
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:49,197
it wasn't just me.

26
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:52,271
Everybody I know in town wants out,
but they can't.

27
00:04:52,405 --> 00:04:53,497
Lord knows,

28
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,074
me and Emmett've been tryin'
to move outta here.

29
00:04:56,743 --> 00:04:58,438
Just not like this.

30
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:03,377
I think I might've fucked it up, Willie.

31
00:05:04,718 --> 00:05:08,654
I mean, Virginia Beach town is fine
three months out of the year.

32
00:05:10,223 --> 00:05:13,090
But September to May,
it starts getting' cold.

33
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:14,784
The snow comes.

34
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,987
Anybody with their head
screwed on right

35
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:20,429
moves the hell outta here
the first chance they get.

36
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:21,966
And if you ask me,

37
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,935
things started gettin' real bad
about a year ago.

38
00:05:25,472 --> 00:05:28,202
Back when that TV-show came to town.

39
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:31,799
All their cameras,
microphones, whatever.

40
00:05:31,945 --> 00:05:34,778
Sheriff, can you give us your take
on what happened here tonight?

41
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:40,109
I believe we need to make examples out
of each and every one of these criminals.

42
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:41,977
Where's the groceries?

43
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:43,885
I forgot our list.

44
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,185
On a state level, as well.

45
00:05:46,326 --> 00:05:50,695
That's why I'm running for a seat
on this great state's Senate in November.

46
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:53,390
- Well, good luck to you, Sheriff.
- Thank you.

47
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,492
So what we have here tonight
is a classic example...

48
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:01,234
Got it all figured out?

49
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,001
All taken care of.

50
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:19,847
Yes.

51
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,825
Yeah, I see them lookin' at me.

52
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:31,569
I know it.
I hear you loud and clear.

53
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:34,003
How 'bout I take these with me, then,

54
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,802
and I'll wash you and you and you later?

55
00:06:38,178 --> 00:06:39,270
Okay.

56
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,559
- All right, so we did this.
- Mm-hmm.

57
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:04,527
Hmm.

58
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:21,750
Our Heavenly Father,

59
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:26,382
thank you for guiding my words and actions
with the TV folks tonight.

60
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:30,194
Forgiving me this time with Virginia.

61
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,232
And, most of all, for keeping us safe
from worldly harm.

62
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:37,234
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

63
00:07:37,937 --> 00:07:38,995
Amen.

64
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,435
So...

65
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:50,742
If you do a good job in this life,

66
00:07:51,584 --> 00:07:54,519
then you get a planet of your own
when you die, right?

67
00:07:54,654 --> 00:07:56,281
Yes.

68
00:07:56,422 --> 00:07:59,482
Just like our Heavenly Father did
before he made us.

69
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,560
Right. And he had wives...

70
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:03,692
...in heaven?

71
00:08:05,899 --> 00:08:07,457
So... will I be there with you?

72
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,034
Of course, we'll all be there, together.

73
00:08:12,739 --> 00:08:14,434
And who's the boss?

74
00:08:15,441 --> 00:08:16,567
- You?
- You bet.

75
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:24,146
Well, then, do you have to use
the same colours for things on this planet,

76
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:25,911
or do you get to pick your own?

77
00:08:26,052 --> 00:08:28,816
I bet we get to make
some choices of our own.

78
00:08:28,955 --> 00:08:31,355
Then we should make people
more colourful.

79
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,958
Like have blue ones,

80
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:34,286
and red.

81
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:37,863
And there are colours
we ain't even thought of.

82
00:08:37,997 --> 00:08:40,261
That could be your job.

83
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,931
He keeps on his special,
prayed-on Mormon underwear

84
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:50,770
when we do it,

85
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,640
'cause Mormon underwear
have special powers

86
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,079
to protect folks
from bullets and demons...

87
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,844
...and probably for him,

88
00:08:58,985 --> 00:09:02,045
to keep women who sleep
with married Mormon men

89
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,053
quiet and not pregnant.

90
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:15,331
It's been goin' on
ever since she was 16,

91
00:09:15,468 --> 00:09:18,266
when he gave her a ride
back to her foster home

92
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:21,771
after she tried burnin' down her school,
not long before she had me.

93
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:26,809
My birth certificate's all blank
in the "Father" spot.

94
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:29,813
So when I was three,
she told me my dad was this NASCAR driver

95
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,008
that had come through town.

96
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,244
You see, you let your kid
go tellin' everybody

97
00:09:36,389 --> 00:09:39,552
that his daddy
just won the Daytona 500.

98
00:09:39,692 --> 00:09:43,150
And after about 20 fights,
I only had one friend left.

99
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:46,129
And he's a haemophiliac,
professional babysitter.

100
00:09:46,266 --> 00:09:48,097
Come here. Let me look.

101
00:09:49,135 --> 00:09:50,625
Easy. Easy now.

102
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:53,969
I think it stopped.

103
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,734
Yeah, you sure about that?

104
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,867
And the only girl
that'd give either of us the time of day

105
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:02,140
was a girl named Jessie.
I think you're gonna live.

106
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,664
You know, she has her dad's lips,

107
00:10:23,603 --> 00:10:26,197
which on him don't quite fit.

108
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:27,806
But, on her,

109
00:10:27,941 --> 00:10:30,808
make the most beautiful mouth
I'll ever see.

110
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:36,239
But we weren't allowed
anywhere near each other.

111
00:10:40,653 --> 00:10:43,451
Genetics is one
of our most powerful sciences.

112
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:46,422
And then,
sophomore year Bio 1 started.

113
00:10:46,559 --> 00:10:49,460
Got everything goin'
in a different direction real quick.

114
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:52,120
And it can tell you
with absolute certainty

115
00:10:52,265 --> 00:10:55,462
who you are and are not related to.

116
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:58,866
We'll start with dangling
versus attached earlobes.

117
00:11:17,223 --> 00:11:18,315
What do you want?

118
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,652
Nothing.

119
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:28,460
Who pissed in your Sugar Puffs?

120
00:11:32,605 --> 00:11:34,470
I'll tell you what, Willie,

121
00:11:34,607 --> 00:11:37,303
nobody pissed in my Sugar Puffs.

122
00:11:37,443 --> 00:11:39,377
My mornin' just sucked balls.

123
00:11:39,512 --> 00:11:41,343
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

124
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,507
But don't take more than it says,
or I can't keep giving it to you.

125
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,742
Sure thing.

126
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,014
So? Am I gonna have a baby?

127
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,556
No.

128
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:53,954
What's in your lungs is growing,

129
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:56,561
and I think maybe that's why
you've missed your period.

130
00:11:56,696 --> 00:11:58,857
Maybe we should just do a backup test.

131
00:11:58,998 --> 00:12:01,558
I gotta pee again anyway.
Well, we could do that again

132
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:04,363
in a month or so,
but what needs to happen right now,

133
00:12:04,504 --> 00:12:07,405
is that you need to meet with a new doctor.

134
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,939
Why?

135
00:12:09,075 --> 00:12:12,909
Um, if what is in your lungs is bad,

136
00:12:13,046 --> 00:12:15,879
then you are gonna need
to be somewhere for a while.

137
00:12:17,984 --> 00:12:20,680
- In a hospital?
- Right.

138
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,050
So if you could just fill out
this paperwork for me,

139
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,590
y'know, out there in the waiting room,
then bring it on back, that'd be terrific.

140
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,160
You think you could do that
for me, Virginia? Sure thing.

141
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,925
Excuse me.

142
00:13:09,068 --> 00:13:10,535
You work here?

143
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:13,203
No. My mom does.

144
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:14,829
Oh.

145
00:13:14,974 --> 00:13:18,967
I'm Max. I own this, uh,
this pier your mom works at.

146
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:22,346
Oh...

147
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:26,179
Um, I was just gettin' a copy of my ear
for... for a school assignment.

148
00:13:29,288 --> 00:13:30,414
I see.

149
00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:33,349
I can pay you for those.

150
00:13:33,493 --> 00:13:35,051
Oh, don't worry.

151
00:13:36,496 --> 00:13:37,656
Thanks.

152
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:43,398
Oh, you're, uh... you're not looking
for a summer job, are you?

153
00:13:43,536 --> 00:13:48,235
I, uh... I got one or two opportunities
still available.

154
00:13:48,374 --> 00:13:50,604
Of course, the top news
is that our governor,

155
00:13:50,743 --> 00:13:52,734
and now presumptive
presidential nominee,

156
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:54,972
has announced
his newest campaign tour dates,

157
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:58,515
including a stop right here on Labour Day.
His dinner will be a barbecue

158
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:01,119
at the home of our very own
Sheriff Richard Tipton,

159
00:14:01,254 --> 00:14:04,587
who is knee-deep in his own run
for State Legislature.

160
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,296
Do you like this one?

161
00:14:17,436 --> 00:14:19,165
That should be fine.

162
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:23,641
Look at this.

163
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:38,583
Do you think she looks pretty in yellow?

164
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,625
Yes. She's beautiful in that one.

165
00:14:41,761 --> 00:14:43,820
Hey, Dad, you got some mail.

166
00:14:49,535 --> 00:14:53,096
You see, I was born
with dangling earlobes.

167
00:14:53,239 --> 00:14:55,469
And according to my biology teacher,

168
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:58,372
unless you went to public school
in South Carolina,

169
00:14:58,511 --> 00:15:00,911
you'd know my mom's ears
and the sheriff's ears

170
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,015
never could've made mine.

171
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,781
So using genetics,

172
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:08,944
for the first time
since I was eight years old

173
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:13,385
I knew for certain
who my father wasn't.

174
00:15:34,981 --> 00:15:37,279
Do you believe in God?

175
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:40,078
Or are you an atheist, sinning scientist?

176
00:15:41,921 --> 00:15:43,616
I don't know.

177
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,020
Well, it's either one or the other, Em.

178
00:15:46,792 --> 00:15:48,419
I got your letter.

179
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,161
Meet me, 1:00 p.m.

180
00:16:23,796 --> 00:16:25,991
Do you think we come from apes?

181
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,461
Do you?

182
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,034
Some people say we do,

183
00:16:30,169 --> 00:16:33,263
but you can't count so much
on science anymore, you know.

184
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:42,038
Who do you think your dad is?

185
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:44,448
Could be anybody.

186
00:16:45,618 --> 00:16:47,779
Anybody with hanging earlobes.

187
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,520
When I got your letter...

188
00:16:52,892 --> 00:16:54,519
...I prayed about it.

189
00:17:22,888 --> 00:17:24,219
You can't do that.

190
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:29,024
Why? There's no reason why not now.

191
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,356
I want a temple wedding first.

192
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:35,024
You have to be a priesthood holder
in good standing in my church

193
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,657
to give me that.

194
00:17:38,637 --> 00:17:40,434
And you just don't have it in you.

195
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,101
Jessie...

196
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:46,268
you really think God's still listenin'
to your daddy's prayers?

197
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:01,852
Seems like there was
always something.

198
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:06,390
Now it was just like
her dad told my mom a million times.

199
00:18:06,532 --> 00:18:08,466
Christians should only do it
with Christians.

200
00:18:08,601 --> 00:18:11,764
Mormon or any other kind.

201
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,714
Virginia,
I need all my drivers.

202
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:27,919
If you can't come in,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

203
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:56,242
Probably a goddamn blessin'.

204
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,250
That job didn't pay crap.

205
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,390
I'll get a new job in a week
when I feel right.

206
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:10,492
You ready?

207
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:14,225
I'm sorry, Emmett.

208
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,029
Serious.

209
00:19:19,939 --> 00:19:21,236
It's fine.

210
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:37,886
"I've just returned from a visit
to my landlord,

211
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:41,390
"the solitary neighbour
that I shall be troubled with.

212
00:19:41,527 --> 00:19:44,394
"This is certainly a beautiful country.

213
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:48,626
"In all England, I do not believe
I could've fixed the situation..."

214
00:19:56,976 --> 00:19:59,843
And April came and went,
and then May.

215
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,103
Come on in, Emmett.

216
00:20:02,248 --> 00:20:04,978
Then summer came along,
like it always does.

217
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:10,183
Mrs. Tyler, I'd like to introduce Emmett.

218
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,419
I'm starting him off in the ticket booth.

219
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,493
I think he's got great potential.

220
00:20:16,962 --> 00:20:19,157
This is, uh, this is my cousin, Barry.

221
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:22,397
Barry? Barry?

222
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,431
This is... this is Emmett.

223
00:20:26,572 --> 00:20:28,540
He's got great potential.

224
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,409
Show Emmett how the register works.

225
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,156
On second thought, Emmett,
go get me a Diet Pepsi and some Dentyne

226
00:20:49,295 --> 00:20:51,320
from the Quickie Stop.
Yes, ma'am.

227
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:24,260
Where have you been?

228
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:27,094
Stayin' away from you.

229
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,630
I had a religious revelation.

230
00:21:32,771 --> 00:21:34,705
A conversion or whatever.

231
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,974
To what?

232
00:21:37,109 --> 00:21:38,804
Bornagain Baptist.

233
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,276
They say you're a cult member.
And you drink blood and crap,

234
00:21:41,413 --> 00:21:43,404
and you think you're gonna
live forever in outer space.

235
00:21:44,016 --> 00:21:47,008
Don't believe everything
you read on the Internet, jerk-ass.

236
00:21:47,152 --> 00:21:48,517
Here you go.

237
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:51,282
If you can believe in a Jesus,
I can believe in a Jesus.

238
00:21:51,423 --> 00:21:54,790
Yeah, well, my Jesus
is better than your Jesus.

239
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:57,887
Prove it.

240
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,997
Convert me.

241
00:22:00,766 --> 00:22:02,859
I'm ready to meet your Jesus.

242
00:22:09,375 --> 00:22:11,707
We used her dad's cash
and my employee discount

243
00:22:11,844 --> 00:22:13,311
to buy a large pizza

244
00:22:13,445 --> 00:22:15,879
and ride the new Revolution
14 times in a row.

245
00:22:18,684 --> 00:22:22,279
I figured if he got my mom,
it was only right I got Jessie.

246
00:22:41,807 --> 00:22:42,739
Get in here, Em!

247
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,742
There's a lady out there
poundin' down my door!

248
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:48,244
I'm busy. Just tell 'em to go away.

249
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,879
She just doesn't like it if I'm not around.

250
00:22:57,022 --> 00:22:59,320
She was okay without you before, right?

251
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,619
When we were little?

252
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,228
Nowadays she's better when I'm here.

253
00:23:05,931 --> 00:23:08,422
Hey, where did the Lamanites
get all that gold from?

254
00:23:16,975 --> 00:23:19,569
Virginia? I know you're in there!

255
00:23:21,113 --> 00:23:23,274
She's not here!

256
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:25,883
Honey, I got the cough syrup.

257
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,315
That was our deal.

258
00:23:27,453 --> 00:23:29,944
I get the cough syrup, you let me in.

259
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:40,556
Now, Virginia...

260
00:23:40,699 --> 00:23:43,429
you need some medical treatment.

261
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,264
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

262
00:23:45,404 --> 00:23:47,702
It's just some tests.

263
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,604
Tests, fests, rest with the best.

264
00:23:50,743 --> 00:23:53,439
Right. Well, I've gone ahead
and reserved your room.

265
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:56,548
And they're gonna admit you on Monday.

266
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:59,173
Oh, no, no. You can't do that.

267
00:23:59,318 --> 00:24:01,047
- Hell, I can.
- Miss Nicholaus.

268
00:24:02,654 --> 00:24:04,417
Now, Miss Nicholaus! Listen...

269
00:24:04,556 --> 00:24:07,081
You don't worry about me.
I'm a good Mormon woman!

270
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,716
God'll look after me!

271
00:24:09,695 --> 00:24:11,788
Miss Nicholaus,
I am asking you nicely,

272
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,830
you give me... give me that cigarette!

273
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,797
- Hell, no!
- You get down off that table

274
00:24:15,934 --> 00:24:18,232
and you give me that cigarette!
Because if you don't,

275
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:20,270
I'm gonna have you forced
into that hospital!

276
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:32,809
None of you and your tricks
can keep me from leaving, you got it?

277
00:24:32,951 --> 00:24:35,181
You come back here,
I'll rip your fucking eyes out!

278
00:24:35,888 --> 00:24:38,482
I am coming back!
And I'm bringin' reinforcements!

279
00:24:38,624 --> 00:24:41,354
And I will drag you out of there
by your teeth!

280
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:43,552
"'Mama Ou," ' you ain't, bitch!

281
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,064
After my grandma died
in a huntin' accident

282
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:54,263
and my grandpa got locked up
for robbin' houses,

283
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:59,002
my mom didn't say a word
for, like, two years to nobody.

284
00:24:59,144 --> 00:25:02,739
She just sat in a psycho ward for kids
up in Atlantic City.

285
00:25:07,653 --> 00:25:11,851
They called it
"traumatic onset of schizophrenia".

286
00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:15,983
The put her on all kinds of pills and probes
tryin'to get her to talk again, but...

287
00:25:17,129 --> 00:25:18,619
...it didn't work.

288
00:25:19,331 --> 00:25:20,696
The only good thing they ever did

289
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,234
was give her a big ol' black nurse
named Willie.

290
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:26,929
He took her along on his donut breaks.

291
00:25:29,408 --> 00:25:32,172
He's probably the only man
who ever really loved my mom

292
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:34,302
without fuckin' her up any.

293
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,351
Put 'em up!

294
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:48,322
Get away from that door.

295
00:26:12,251 --> 00:26:13,309
Okay.

296
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:17,419
Oh, my God.

297
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:20,683
Let's say it's a birthday present.

298
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,157
Oh, my God.

299
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:25,692
- Is it real?
- Yes, it's real.

300
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:35,836
You didn't tell me he'd have a friend over.

301
00:26:35,974 --> 00:26:38,534
Who? Oh, you mean Dale?

302
00:26:39,544 --> 00:26:44,811
I was thinkin' maybe...
they could go someplace else tonight.

303
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,180
Well, they still have one more movie.

304
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:49,412
Total runnin' time, 164 minutes.

305
00:27:06,872 --> 00:27:09,238
Look what Mr. Tipton
got you as a present.

306
00:27:10,108 --> 00:27:12,076
He says it's half-price night at the pier.

307
00:27:12,811 --> 00:27:15,109
I'm gonna hang here for a while.

308
00:27:31,964 --> 00:27:33,454
Let's go.

309
00:27:33,598 --> 00:27:35,122
Hold me close.

310
00:27:35,267 --> 00:27:39,601
And tell me how you feel.

311
00:27:42,975 --> 00:27:46,274
Tell me love is real

312
00:28:02,861 --> 00:28:04,385
Words of love.

313
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:09,796
You whisper soft and true...

314
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,728
I need to tell you somethin'.

315
00:28:19,244 --> 00:28:21,007
I went to the doctor.

316
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,173
He let me know somethin' big.

317
00:28:24,883 --> 00:28:26,214
What is it?

318
00:28:29,821 --> 00:28:31,220
Hmm?

319
00:28:31,356 --> 00:28:33,847
I'm gonna have a baby.

320
00:28:33,992 --> 00:28:35,289
A new one.

321
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,730
Whose baby?

322
00:28:45,437 --> 00:28:46,927
It's all yours.

323
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,267
I promise.

324
00:28:50,409 --> 00:28:52,434
There ain't been nobody else.

325
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:57,709
Untie me.

326
00:29:00,018 --> 00:29:01,007
Are you mad?

327
00:29:01,153 --> 00:29:02,620
Just untie me.

328
00:29:12,597 --> 00:29:15,065
You've been doin' this
with somebody else again?

329
00:29:16,101 --> 00:29:17,830
Nobody else.

330
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:19,266
I promise.

331
00:29:23,141 --> 00:29:26,133
You know, I personally
don't believe in it, but...

332
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,071
...in this case, I...

333
00:29:30,215 --> 00:29:33,412
I think it's best if I
support your decision

334
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:35,144
not to have this baby.

335
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:39,590
I ain't gonna do that.

336
00:29:39,724 --> 00:29:42,522
Virginia... tell me,

337
00:29:42,661 --> 00:29:45,255
what other option do we have?

338
00:29:46,565 --> 00:29:48,157
- Hmm?
- I don't know.

339
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,098
- Hmm?
- Dick, I won't tell nobody.

340
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:54,398
I promise.

341
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:56,530
No, no, I-I just can't
have this right now.

342
00:29:56,675 --> 00:29:58,438
- I fucked up last time!
- It's just not possible!

343
00:29:58,577 --> 00:30:01,546
I know I fucked up last time,
but this one'll be raised right, I swear!

344
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:04,649
I swear to you, Dick,
I will do everything right!

345
00:30:09,521 --> 00:30:10,647
Dick...

346
00:30:12,057 --> 00:30:13,217
Please.

347
00:30:34,246 --> 00:30:38,205
From then on, every Tuesday,
there was money in the mail.

348
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:41,714
I could've moved us
outta here in six months

349
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:45,619
with a couple hundred bucks a week,
and we needed outta here real bad, Willie.

350
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:49,392
And I guess nobody noticed
he was sendin' me campaign money,

351
00:30:49,528 --> 00:30:52,156
'cause his campaign folks
had bigger fish to fry.

352
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:53,855
We have a problem.

353
00:30:53,999 --> 00:30:56,695
The governor doesn't want
to come here anymore for Labour Day.

354
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:59,133
- Why not?
- Because they have

355
00:30:59,271 --> 00:31:01,762
a red-white-and-blue Ferris wheel
up in Jersey.

356
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,431
What colour is our Ferris wheel?

357
00:31:03,842 --> 00:31:06,072
Pink, and it ain't ours.

358
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,501
Move it! Move it!

359
00:31:45,984 --> 00:31:48,111
I know what you people think of me.

360
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:53,153
Well, fuck you! Okay? Fuck you!!

361
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,555
That's my pink Ferris wheel,

362
00:31:55,694 --> 00:31:57,559
and it's staying pink!

363
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,960
And I want my goddamn lawyer.

364
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:03,065
I...

365
00:32:03,201 --> 00:32:06,534
I really would like
to change the colour of your Ferris wheel.

366
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:09,905
So... what can I offer you?

367
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:16,977
Well, I wanna be on the city's board
from here on out.

368
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:20,949
- Done.
- And I go to all the campaign events.

369
00:32:21,086 --> 00:32:23,418
Great. We can do that.

370
00:32:25,156 --> 00:32:27,124
Then you repaint my wheel.

371
00:32:29,828 --> 00:32:30,886
Pink.

372
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,456
Right?

373
00:32:56,921 --> 00:32:58,013
Mom?

374
00:32:59,557 --> 00:33:02,219
Mom, this is Emmett.

375
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,294
Oh... Oh, I'm sorry.

376
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:06,590
I don't wanna stain your nice shirt.

377
00:33:07,632 --> 00:33:09,793
Are you with our congregation?

378
00:33:10,869 --> 00:33:12,928
I don't know. I live east of here.

379
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:17,567
He doesn't go to church yet,
he's thinkin' about coming to ours.

380
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:21,873
Oh. Great.
Well, you can sit with us on Sunday, then.

381
00:33:23,548 --> 00:33:26,278
And this is Richard, my husband.

382
00:33:27,185 --> 00:33:31,087
Richard, this is Jessica's new friend,
Emmett.

383
00:33:31,222 --> 00:33:32,985
It's nice to meet you, sir.

384
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:34,455
We've met before.

385
00:33:35,493 --> 00:33:37,324
Well, it's a surprise seein' you here.

386
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:39,794
I'm always the last to know.

387
00:33:43,968 --> 00:33:45,435
Are you alone?

388
00:33:46,104 --> 00:33:47,332
Yes, sir.

389
00:33:56,815 --> 00:33:59,477
America.

390
00:33:59,617 --> 00:34:00,914
America.

391
00:34:01,986 --> 00:34:04,250
God shed his grace on thee.

392
00:34:05,457 --> 00:34:07,152
The grace of trust...

393
00:34:08,059 --> 00:34:09,993
...of tradition,

394
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:11,493
and of self-reliance.

395
00:34:18,536 --> 00:34:20,163
It was a quick edit.

396
00:34:20,305 --> 00:34:22,705
We'll have a better version Monday.

397
00:34:24,209 --> 00:34:25,699
You, follow me.

398
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:42,720
Well, I've been workin' real hard
at improvin' myself, sir.

399
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:45,625
I can honestly say I've studied
and am following every rule

400
00:34:45,764 --> 00:34:48,324
in the Doctrine and Covenants
and Words of Wisdom books.

401
00:34:48,466 --> 00:34:49,524
I even gave up coffee.

402
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:53,865
Emmett, there are a few different kinds
of people in this world,

403
00:34:54,005 --> 00:34:56,439
and if they know
what's best for themselves,

404
00:34:56,574 --> 00:34:59,008
they stick to their own backyards.

405
00:34:59,677 --> 00:35:01,304
You see, there are things

406
00:35:01,446 --> 00:35:03,505
that cross the lines of nature.

407
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,583
Hmm? Break the laws
of civilized society.

408
00:35:10,288 --> 00:35:13,052
I don't just mean
in the eyes of the Lord.

409
00:35:14,225 --> 00:35:15,283
- Sir...
- What?

410
00:35:16,094 --> 00:35:17,425
Yes?

411
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:20,190
I've been meanin' to tell you
for a while now, sir.

412
00:35:20,331 --> 00:35:22,697
Well, tell me, Emmett. What?

413
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:26,133
Well, I'm not your kid, sir.
I can prove it if you want me to...

414
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:37,771
You have any idea how many men
your momma used to let into her room?

415
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:40,612
Hmm? Just because I'm the only one
who still comes around

416
00:35:40,752 --> 00:35:43,721
does not mean I am your father!!!

417
00:35:45,757 --> 00:35:47,816
Look at yourself. It's clear as day.

418
00:35:47,959 --> 00:35:49,358
- Dick, can we talk?

419
00:35:49,494 --> 00:35:50,518
Not right now, dear.

420
00:35:50,662 --> 00:35:51,856
Oh!

421
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:06,001
- Get on the ground.
- What?

422
00:36:06,144 --> 00:36:07,270
Get...

423
00:36:12,050 --> 00:36:14,041
Our shit ain't good enough
for your house, right?

424
00:36:15,019 --> 00:36:17,715
But you come mix yours up in mine
anytime you want.

425
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:21,523
Emmett, you may think
what I've done is wrong,

426
00:36:21,659 --> 00:36:24,355
but what you're doing is against God.

427
00:36:24,496 --> 00:36:27,522
Fuck your God. And fuck you.
I'll love my babies more

428
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:30,065
than you've ever loved
your whole fucked-up family.

429
00:36:30,201 --> 00:36:31,463
That's not true, Emmett.

430
00:36:31,603 --> 00:36:34,401
Stay on the ground
or I'll clean out your skull.

431
00:36:36,341 --> 00:36:37,535
That's... That's enough now.

432
00:36:37,675 --> 00:36:39,165
Stay on the fuckin' ground.

433
00:37:02,534 --> 00:37:04,502
We never judged
our boy's girlfriends first

434
00:37:04,636 --> 00:37:07,799
before we got to know them.
It just doesn't seem fair...

435
00:37:07,939 --> 00:37:09,531
Jesus H. Christ, Roseanna.

436
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,472
Does my judgment not mean a goddamn thing
in my own house?!

437
00:37:14,479 --> 00:37:16,242
Oh! Oh...

438
00:37:22,587 --> 00:37:24,452
I'm so sorry.

439
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:27,820
I just wish you wouldn't use
the Lord's name in vain.

440
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:41,896
Dear Heavenly Father...

441
00:37:42,574 --> 00:37:44,667
...please grant my loving daughter guidance

442
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:48,301
to understand the path that she is on,
the path that she must take.

443
00:37:48,446 --> 00:37:50,539
The path that we must share together

444
00:37:50,682 --> 00:37:53,776
as a family, as difficult as it is.

445
00:37:53,918 --> 00:37:57,183
And we want to thank you
for a wonderful evening

446
00:37:57,322 --> 00:37:59,381
with the wonderful television ad.

447
00:37:59,524 --> 00:38:03,722
And the support for our father
and our husband, Richard.

448
00:38:03,861 --> 00:38:07,490
Through you, our Lord, Jesus Christ.
Amen.

449
00:38:14,806 --> 00:38:16,535
From then on,

450
00:38:16,674 --> 00:38:19,074
every Saturday night
she started ditchin' her prayer group.

451
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:24,312
And I never heard her say
too much about the Angel Moroni,

452
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:28,681
the Lamanites or Mormon priesthood
blessings ever again after all that.

453
00:38:37,829 --> 00:38:41,287
But it didn't take long to figure out
her dad had given his boy permission

454
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:44,094
to do whatever he could
to keep me away from Jessie.

455
00:38:45,236 --> 00:38:47,067
Must've called me the devil himself.

456
00:38:55,113 --> 00:38:58,082
I'm not interested!

457
00:38:58,216 --> 00:38:59,740
It's me, Mom.

458
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,351
- Oh, my God. They got you.
- No, no.

459
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:10,654
Which ones was it?
What'd they look like?

460
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,286
I started boxin' at school.

461
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,227
Sit down.

462
00:39:17,301 --> 00:39:18,632
Let me see.

463
00:39:22,206 --> 00:39:23,639
Does it hurt?

464
00:39:24,876 --> 00:39:25,865
No?

465
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,108
Emmett...

466
00:39:32,116 --> 00:39:35,313
We need to have a special talk.
How about Sizzler's?

467
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:37,921
- Just tell me.
- No!

468
00:39:38,856 --> 00:39:40,414
I got money now.

469
00:39:41,726 --> 00:39:43,421
Where'd you get money from?

470
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,654
A woman has her secrets.

471
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:46,855
Do you like this?

472
00:39:47,632 --> 00:39:49,930
I'm not goin' till you tell me.

473
00:39:51,669 --> 00:39:54,137
Okay, but I don't want you to worry.

474
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:02,274
I'm pregnant...
with Sheriff Tipton's baby.

475
00:40:04,215 --> 00:40:06,877
Although... I'm still thinkin'

476
00:40:07,018 --> 00:40:09,043
maybe I got it from God, like Mary did.

477
00:40:10,822 --> 00:40:12,619
'Cause I used rubbers every time.

478
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:13,849
I'm serious.

479
00:40:14,826 --> 00:40:17,351
But we can't tell a single soul.
Gotta keep it a secret.

480
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:24,258
Promise. Cross your heart.

481
00:40:26,904 --> 00:40:28,235
I promise.

482
00:40:28,372 --> 00:40:29,430
Cross my heart.

483
00:40:31,142 --> 00:40:34,634
'Cause when I start growin',
we're gonna need to leave here,

484
00:40:34,779 --> 00:40:39,876
so those... city folks
don't start asking questions.

485
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:42,883
Get us all wrapped up in controversy.

486
00:40:43,221 --> 00:40:45,849
Lock us behind bars. Whatever.

487
00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:47,287
Where are we going?

488
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,194
San Fran with your aunt, where else?

489
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:52,796
We don't have enough money yet.

490
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:58,430
He's givin' me hush money for the baby.
So we'll be loaded in no time.

491
00:40:58,569 --> 00:41:01,163
We're gonna get two tickets outta here.
First class.

492
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,566
Now...

493
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:06,836
...can we go get some shrimp cocktail?

494
00:41:16,654 --> 00:41:18,622
When I was in second grade,

495
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:22,522
the counsellor called me in for a meetin'
after my 20th fight.

496
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,855
She'd met my mom that mornin'.

497
00:41:24,996 --> 00:41:26,588
And in her own roundabout way,

498
00:41:26,731 --> 00:41:28,062
she told me I couldn't believe

499
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:30,531
all the stories my mom told me
all the time.

500
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:33,369
But how was I supposed to know

501
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,768
what I should and shouldn't believe
from my own mom.

502
00:41:35,907 --> 00:41:37,738
Let's go.

503
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,571
Problem is, I still guess wrong
every now and then.

504
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:50,884
Excuse me!

505
00:41:54,192 --> 00:41:55,887
What are you doin' with my letters?

506
00:41:56,027 --> 00:41:57,119
Putting 'em in your box.

507
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:59,991
You've been takin' my letters
and my money, haven't you?

508
00:42:00,131 --> 00:42:01,291
No, ma'am.

509
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:03,798
Who you workin' for, mister? Huh?

510
00:42:04,836 --> 00:42:06,531
Give me my letters.

511
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:10,970
Give me my goddamn...
give me my goddamn letters!

512
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,245
Hi, Ms. Nicholaus.

513
00:42:21,786 --> 00:42:22,753
Hi.

514
00:42:24,589 --> 00:42:26,454
How'd you know it was me?

515
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:29,015
'Cause you're with Emmett.

516
00:42:30,761 --> 00:42:32,456
I'm goin' in alone.

517
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:41,528
Good to see you.
Thank you so much. Really appreciate it.

518
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:42,969
- Oh, hi, Dick.
- Well, hello, Max.

519
00:42:43,107 --> 00:42:44,665
Congratulations.
What a wonderful speech.

520
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,471
- Thank you.
- Oh, I have a question.

521
00:42:47,612 --> 00:42:51,708
Why didn't you ask me to your house
to watch your commercial? Hmm?

522
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:54,374
I mean, I consider that a campaign event.

523
00:42:54,518 --> 00:42:56,679
I thought we had a deal.

524
00:42:56,821 --> 00:42:59,415
I could've been very helpful.

525
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:03,015
Dick? I could've been helpful to you.
I saw it.

526
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:06,061
It, uh... it wasn't a home run.
It wasn't so great, Dick.

527
00:43:06,197 --> 00:43:07,562
Dick?

528
00:43:07,698 --> 00:43:09,859
Earth calling Dick. Hmm?

529
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:20,701
He's movin' us to Richmond
when he wins the election.

530
00:43:23,714 --> 00:43:26,114
Are you... are you goin' with him?

531
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:28,416
If I do...

532
00:43:30,454 --> 00:43:32,115
...it'll ruin me, Em.

533
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:38,593
Stay here with us.
I mean, I can take care of you both.

534
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:43,131
Only if you ask me to stay forever.

535
00:43:43,801 --> 00:43:45,428
Then I'll say yes.

536
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:51,703
You know what I mean.

537
00:43:54,011 --> 00:43:56,912
I... I want to see you,
but... now's not the right time.

538
00:43:57,048 --> 00:44:01,212
Okay, you're the boss.
Say when, I'll be there.

539
00:44:02,086 --> 00:44:07,353
Listen to me, this life
is just a little grain of sand in time.

540
00:44:09,327 --> 00:44:11,557
It's the next life that counts.

541
00:44:11,696 --> 00:44:13,493
And there we'll be together.

542
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:17,897
So... why are you so damn worried
about me being here in this life?

543
00:44:18,035 --> 00:44:21,732
Because right now, this time, legally,

544
00:44:21,872 --> 00:44:25,968
you know, historically,
especially right now...

545
00:44:27,645 --> 00:44:29,510
...it's impossible for us
to follow God's plan...

546
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:31,512
Excuse me. Dick, please.

547
00:44:32,616 --> 00:44:34,584
Can I help you, ma'am?

548
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:36,976
- Hi, Virginia.
- Hi.

549
00:44:37,121 --> 00:44:39,248
- I'm cutting the line off for tonight.
- Okay, I'll be quick.

550
00:44:39,390 --> 00:44:41,415
I'm sorry, Virginia.
It's best... Just save it for later.

551
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:44,392
Okay. Somebody's been
interceptin' my letters.

552
00:44:44,528 --> 00:44:48,658
He'd wanna talk to me about that right now.
Promise.

553
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:51,893
Later's just way too late.
Virginia, the line's cut off, okay?

554
00:44:52,036 --> 00:44:55,301
Between you and me, I think it'd be better
if you don't call the office anymore.

555
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,240
Your letters aren't being intercepted,
they've been stopped.

556
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:02,972
For good.
Those are the Sheriff's words. Not mine.

557
00:45:54,265 --> 00:45:56,233
I'm never gonna leave you.

558
00:45:57,835 --> 00:45:59,427
You always got me.

559
00:46:00,271 --> 00:46:01,465
Forever.

560
00:46:03,174 --> 00:46:06,337
Oh, I'm all bleedin'
and dried up inside.

561
00:46:12,149 --> 00:46:13,582
He loves you.

562
00:46:15,386 --> 00:46:18,446
But he's just too messed up
to know it right now.

563
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,525
Now come on.

564
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:27,793
I'll give you a ride.

565
00:46:51,755 --> 00:46:54,383
You're the best thing I ever did, Emmett.

566
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,060
You know that?

567
00:47:00,331 --> 00:47:02,629
I did you right, don't you think?

568
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,608
We need to get outta here.

569
00:47:12,643 --> 00:47:14,338
For real, this time.

570
00:47:22,019 --> 00:47:24,954
That night,
my ears started ringin'.

571
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,750
And all the air in the world went out.

572
00:47:30,161 --> 00:47:32,220
And nobody knows it,

573
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:35,230
but I get scared
when she gets knocked down like that.

574
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:38,699
Because she keeps right on fallin'

575
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:40,463
and it don't stop.

576
00:47:51,649 --> 00:47:55,676
So I gotta protect her,
'cause she's all I ever had in this world.

577
00:47:57,988 --> 00:48:00,013
And as far as I can tell,

578
00:48:00,157 --> 00:48:03,957
she's more good than most people ever get
in their whole lives.

579
00:48:39,897 --> 00:48:41,956
I got two to feed. Let's go.

580
00:48:54,812 --> 00:48:56,211
Emmett.

581
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:03,350
I asked Dick once
if I was like a second wife

582
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,082
after I saw this show on Mormons
and he said that I was like that.

583
00:49:08,993 --> 00:49:11,461
We're shopping. Help me unload.

584
00:49:11,595 --> 00:49:14,462
Except I had to keep it secret,
'cause it's illegal, which is true.

585
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:16,862
On that show,
they sent that Mormon man to prison

586
00:49:17,001 --> 00:49:19,128
for havin' too many wives.

587
00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:21,465
I'm good with secrets, Willie.

588
00:49:22,406 --> 00:49:24,966
Unless you piss me off.
Paper or plastic?

589
00:49:26,243 --> 00:49:28,006
I'm having Sheriff Tipton's baby.

590
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:32,507
Lori! Hi. Look.

591
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:37,144
I'm pregnant with Sheriff Tipton's baby.
Can you believe it?

592
00:49:37,288 --> 00:49:39,916
You know he's been knocking me up
for 16 years now.

593
00:49:40,057 --> 00:49:41,081
Mmhmm.

594
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:44,391
ShinLee, it was bound to happen.

595
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:45,952
Mm.

596
00:49:51,335 --> 00:49:53,701
I need you to do some things for me.

597
00:49:53,837 --> 00:49:55,737
How many things?

598
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:57,500
Three big things.

599
00:49:57,641 --> 00:49:58,767
What kind?

600
00:50:00,177 --> 00:50:02,941
I need grandma and
grandpa's weddin' rings.

601
00:50:05,549 --> 00:50:06,777
What for?

602
00:50:07,818 --> 00:50:10,116
To get married with. What else?

603
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:17,619
I'm gonna make us
peas and carrots tonight.

604
00:50:17,761 --> 00:50:20,958
From scratch.
Maybe try it with cream sauce.

605
00:50:21,098 --> 00:50:23,293
I ain't leavin' you for her.

606
00:50:24,702 --> 00:50:27,967
People want one at a time, Emmett.
That's just how it is.

607
00:50:28,672 --> 00:50:31,072
The other one rots
in the back of the fridge.

608
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,505
Bullshit.

609
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:38,448
I can take care of myself.

610
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:42,216
It'll just make our family bigger.

611
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:43,877
More people around'll be nice.

612
00:50:44,021 --> 00:50:46,285
So is that one thing, or two?

613
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:49,859
One. The other thing is,
you gotta lay low for a while.

614
00:50:49,993 --> 00:50:53,520
So that means you can't make no war
on her dad right now. Not yet.

615
00:50:53,664 --> 00:50:55,495
Fuck me. Three?

616
00:50:57,034 --> 00:50:59,400
I don't just want the rings,

617
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:01,299
I want your blessin'.

618
00:51:07,444 --> 00:51:10,004
They'll marry anybody
up in Atlantic City.

619
00:51:10,881 --> 00:51:14,476
Brothers marrying sisters,
black people marryin' white people,

620
00:51:14,618 --> 00:51:15,915
drunk people marryin' drunk people.

621
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:18,317
I don't see why they wouldn't marry
the two of you.

622
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,407
I could decorate it.

623
00:51:44,948 --> 00:51:46,916
I could make it real nice.

624
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:55,248
Get white... white flowers
and ribbons and cake.

625
00:51:57,194 --> 00:52:00,027
I wanna get some champagne,
that's for damn sure.

626
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:02,359
- Well, it doesn't have to be fancy.
- Shhh.

627
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,294
Okay.

628
00:52:08,672 --> 00:52:11,072
I'm givin' you one, two and three.

629
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,776
This one from mom.

630
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:25,949
This one from dad.

631
00:52:40,103 --> 00:52:41,127
Wow.

632
00:52:42,639 --> 00:52:44,402
Not so heavy anymore.

633
00:52:50,247 --> 00:52:51,646
All right.

634
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,079
Thank you.

635
00:52:53,217 --> 00:52:56,778
Careful. It's a live one.
Oh, lord! My goodness.

636
00:52:57,254 --> 00:52:59,381
Thank you.

637
00:53:52,743 --> 00:53:54,802
Shin-Lee over
at the dry cleaners told me.

638
00:53:54,945 --> 00:53:58,938
Roseanna told their bishop
that he wasn't puttin' it in her anymore.

639
00:54:00,684 --> 00:54:02,311
He put her on anti-anxious pills

640
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:05,182
and put their house up for sale
right after all that.

641
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:09,951
God knows, he never could admit
a damn thing was his fault.

642
00:54:14,231 --> 00:54:16,961
What do you mean when you say collateral?

643
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,536
Well, you know, just anything of value
that you can back the loan up with.

644
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:24,800
No. I don't have that.

645
00:54:24,942 --> 00:54:26,068
That's why I need a loan.

646
00:54:27,644 --> 00:54:30,112
And what is this loan for exactly?

647
00:54:30,247 --> 00:54:35,378
Well... I gotta get up to Atlantic City,
get a couple hotel rooms,

648
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,077
and help my son get married.

649
00:54:37,854 --> 00:54:39,321
It's gotta be a beautiful wedding.

650
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:42,753
Then maybe play the slots a little.

651
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,293
When we get back though,
we're leavin' this hell hole

652
00:54:45,429 --> 00:54:48,057
to go live out in
California with my sister.

653
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:52,030
And she's my son's legal mom anyhow, so...

654
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:55,061
...it's all on the up-and-up.

655
00:54:57,941 --> 00:55:01,433
Listen, Virginia,
I shouldn't even be telling you this,

656
00:55:01,578 --> 00:55:03,443
but I can't give you a loan right now,

657
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,413
because the bank is
completely out of money.

658
00:55:13,423 --> 00:55:15,391
What kind of horse shit is that?

659
00:55:16,526 --> 00:55:17,993
No. It's true.

660
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,633
I'm very sorry to hear about that.

661
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:34,770
Thank you for your time.

662
00:55:53,897 --> 00:55:56,798
Betty, how much money's in your bank?

663
00:55:56,933 --> 00:55:58,059
Oh, hey, V.

664
00:55:58,201 --> 00:56:02,638
I believe we need to make examples
of each and every one of these criminals.

665
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:05,241
Not just on a local level,

666
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:08,310
but on a state level, as well.

667
00:56:08,445 --> 00:56:12,108
That's why I'm running for a seat
on this great state's Senate in November.

668
00:56:14,384 --> 00:56:16,215
Appreciate havin' me on the show.

669
00:56:16,353 --> 00:56:18,651
- So how much?
- Shut up, baby.

670
00:56:18,789 --> 00:56:20,188
Look, you're on TV!

671
00:56:27,898 --> 00:56:29,866
...Sheriff's Patrol
have a gift for people like that.

672
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,833
And that's a one-way ticket
to the county jail.

673
00:56:32,969 --> 00:56:36,427
On The Scene
is filmed on location.

674
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:39,906
Real crimes, real justice,
in your backyard.

675
00:57:33,764 --> 00:57:36,892
I knew what I was about to do
was wrong, Willie.

676
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:40,059
But like you always told me,
I have responsibilities.

677
00:57:40,604 --> 00:57:44,233
And I'm not blaming you.
I was just trying as hard as I could

678
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:47,468
to take care of my shit,
and my kid and everything.

679
00:58:04,194 --> 00:58:06,594
And the way things
were falling into place,

680
00:58:07,697 --> 00:58:10,757
you'd have thought
God himself wanted it to happen.

681
00:58:28,952 --> 00:58:30,078
Betty?

682
00:58:33,023 --> 00:58:35,150
Oh, my God, Emmett. Not now.

683
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:36,816
I'm late as hell for work.

684
00:58:38,595 --> 00:58:40,825
Where's your mom? Is she all right?

685
00:58:40,964 --> 00:58:42,329
I think so.

686
00:58:43,934 --> 00:58:46,266
Betty, can I use your Granada?

687
00:58:46,403 --> 00:58:48,701
What the hell do you want
that piece of shit for?

688
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:52,001
We're goin' to Atlantic City.

689
00:58:52,142 --> 00:58:53,973
What for?

690
00:58:54,110 --> 00:58:55,907
I'm getting' married.

691
00:58:56,046 --> 00:58:57,206
Emmett!

692
00:58:59,683 --> 00:59:02,481
You're still too damn pretty
to get married.

693
00:59:05,488 --> 00:59:07,786
Don't go off and ruin everything.

694
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,393
Can I use it?

695
00:59:13,630 --> 00:59:14,790
Christ.

696
00:59:21,838 --> 00:59:23,829
Fill her up before you bring her back.

697
00:59:24,908 --> 00:59:27,604
Premium only!

698
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,771
Hey.

699
01:00:38,915 --> 01:00:41,975
Hello. Does a Virginia Nicholaus
live here with you?

700
01:00:59,569 --> 01:01:00,593
- Ma'am...
- Oh!

701
01:01:00,737 --> 01:01:03,228
You can't wear that in here.

702
01:01:03,773 --> 01:01:04,933
Oh, no!

703
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,935
Mom?

704
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,277
Hi.

705
01:02:16,312 --> 01:02:18,246
Where'd you go?

706
01:02:18,381 --> 01:02:19,973
Just exercisin'. Who's here?

707
01:02:20,116 --> 01:02:21,674
A couple of Mormons.

708
01:02:21,818 --> 01:02:24,719
- What do they want?
- You. That's what they said.

709
01:02:24,854 --> 01:02:26,651
Are you sure they're actual Mormons?

710
01:02:27,524 --> 01:02:29,355
They're the real deal.

711
01:02:30,427 --> 01:02:32,918
Okay. Um, go keep 'em company.

712
01:02:33,063 --> 01:02:34,690
I'm late for work.

713
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:37,561
Fine. Um...
Tell 'em I'll just need a minute, okay?

714
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:55,047
All units in the area be advised,

715
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:58,780
10-91 at Broadway Trust Bank
on Riverton Road.

716
01:02:58,922 --> 01:03:02,187
All units in the area...

717
01:03:07,797 --> 01:03:12,029
- What's wrong?
- Bank robbery. Everything's fine.

718
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,417
Mom?

719
01:03:39,262 --> 01:03:42,356
It's like God sent you down to me.

720
01:03:42,532 --> 01:03:44,727
I've always wanted to be a Christian.

721
01:03:44,868 --> 01:03:48,269
I just... I wasn't sure
if I was good enough.

722
01:03:49,906 --> 01:03:52,374
Ma'am, the ladies
that sent us over here

723
01:03:52,509 --> 01:03:55,740
said that you told her that you
were already a member of our ward.

724
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:58,142
Who told you I said that?

725
01:03:58,281 --> 01:04:01,444
Uh, Mrs. Whitaker, your social worker.

726
01:04:01,584 --> 01:04:03,518
Oh. She's a lyin' whore.

727
01:04:03,653 --> 01:04:05,746
I don't have a social worker.

728
01:04:06,923 --> 01:04:10,381
Ma'am... she said you were sick,

729
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:13,223
and you didn't... want help.

730
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,960
Why... why is that?
It's because she's one of 'em.

731
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:20,202
Make my lungs go all swish.

732
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:21,803
Everything goes out.

733
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:23,633
But what I want to know...

734
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:28,034
...is how do I become a good Mormon?

735
01:04:29,946 --> 01:04:31,504
Well, it's a process.

736
01:04:31,648 --> 01:04:33,673
But it's not too hard.

737
01:04:34,951 --> 01:04:37,078
- It's not, is it?
- Ma'am,

738
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:41,816
I was hoping that we could take you
down to the hospital

739
01:04:41,958 --> 01:04:43,516
and have them take a look at you.

740
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:46,527
Honey, I'm feelin' so much better now.
You don't have to worry about that.

741
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:49,489
Uh, well, then, ma'am,

742
01:04:49,632 --> 01:04:53,159
can we just give you a blessing
before we go?

743
01:04:55,004 --> 01:04:56,596
What do you mean?

744
01:04:56,739 --> 01:04:59,503
It's just to absolve you of your sins,

745
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:02,736
in case anything does happen to you.

746
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:04,176
So you can go to heaven.

747
01:05:05,949 --> 01:05:07,473
I need that to get to heaven?

748
01:05:11,087 --> 01:05:12,577
Clears up everything?

749
01:05:12,722 --> 01:05:15,247
Well, as long
as you're sincere about it, yeah.

750
01:05:16,426 --> 01:05:19,395
Okay... Let's do it.

751
01:05:23,499 --> 01:05:26,468
I mean, I'm not sure if it was real,
or just some crazy person,

752
01:05:26,603 --> 01:05:30,903
but I'm real sure it was no woman.

753
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,100
It was not a woman.
That was clear.

754
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:53,251
So, uh, if you need anything,
uh, just call this number.

755
01:05:53,396 --> 01:05:55,227
Oh, thank you.

756
01:05:55,365 --> 01:05:56,696
It's... It's mine.

757
01:06:10,213 --> 01:06:13,080
There's no tellin'
why they didn't come right after me,

758
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,711
but I felt real bad about Dale.

759
01:06:21,457 --> 01:06:24,984
And Max, that was just plain old politics.

760
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,619
Just takin' him out while they could.

761
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:35,068
Only a fuckin' moron
would rob a bank.

762
01:06:35,705 --> 01:06:38,503
Everybody knows
banks aren't where it's at.

763
01:06:41,311 --> 01:06:43,438
So when do you think
they might let you outta here?

764
01:06:44,314 --> 01:06:45,747
I don't know.

765
01:06:47,817 --> 01:06:50,149
You still goin' up
to get married tomorrow?

766
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:57,087
We could wait a week or so.

767
01:06:57,226 --> 01:06:59,717
I mean, there'll be other chances.

768
01:07:01,497 --> 01:07:04,295
I need you there.
You're my best man.

769
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:12,497
You know, your boss, Max,
is in here with me.

770
01:07:13,443 --> 01:07:16,810
Says he's gonna help me set up
my first daycare centre when I get out.

771
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:21,245
So this all just might be
some blessin' in disguise.

772
01:07:23,886 --> 01:07:25,820
Don't let me fuck your plans up.

773
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:29,958
We're meetin' at the bus
station at 8:00 a.m.

774
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:32,821
So if you get outta here,
you meet us there, okay?

775
01:07:39,535 --> 01:07:40,559
All right?

776
01:07:52,749 --> 01:07:55,513
I'm goin' in to get her.
I'll keep watch.

777
01:08:05,461 --> 01:08:08,726
Local service
for Atlantic Avenue, bus number 24,

778
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:10,696
is now leaving lot 1.

779
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:16,468
Local service to Atlantic Avenue,
bus 24, lot 1.

780
01:08:24,213 --> 01:08:26,147
Bus 15 to Norfolk...

781
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:28,250
leaving in 10 minutes.

782
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:38,226
Get in the stall, get on your knees.
Get in the stall. Get in the stall.

783
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:40,192
Get down on your knees.

784
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:43,528
What are you doin' here?

785
01:08:43,666 --> 01:08:46,032
Me and my mom
are goin' on a trip.

786
01:08:48,738 --> 01:08:51,138
You need to learn
how to keep your momma quiet, boy.

787
01:08:52,675 --> 01:08:54,404
I don't think I can.

788
01:08:56,145 --> 01:08:58,079
For better or worse.

789
01:08:58,214 --> 01:08:59,909
Way I see it,

790
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:02,279
she's the only person
fucked up enough in the head

791
01:09:02,418 --> 01:09:05,478
to really give a goddamn about you.

792
01:09:07,156 --> 01:09:09,920
Don't you ever talk like that
about your mother again!

793
01:09:13,429 --> 01:09:15,124
I want my gun back.

794
01:09:15,898 --> 01:09:17,126
It's gone.

795
01:09:17,266 --> 01:09:18,824
All units, be advised

796
01:09:18,968 --> 01:09:20,936
we have an escaped suspect...

797
01:09:22,438 --> 01:09:25,566
If you come within 100 yards
of anyone in my family ever again,

798
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,801
I will clean out your skull.

799
01:09:27,944 --> 01:09:29,741
Do you hear me?

800
01:09:31,280 --> 01:09:32,304
Hmm?

801
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:35,106
Well, then do it.

802
01:09:36,185 --> 01:09:38,346
It'll fuck up your life
more than it'll fuck up mine.

803
01:09:38,488 --> 01:09:39,512
- Dad?

804
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:45,025
Relax, Josh. Go back outside.

805
01:09:46,229 --> 01:09:48,197
Sir, there's...
there's a jailbreak.

806
01:09:48,331 --> 01:09:50,799
I heard the call. I'll be right out.

807
01:10:06,182 --> 01:10:07,774
Keep pressure on it.

808
01:10:19,529 --> 01:10:22,464
Jessie's friend
said she'd cover for her.

809
01:10:22,598 --> 01:10:26,193
Get their IDS bus trip on the road
so we could go get hitched,

810
01:10:26,335 --> 01:10:28,735
up in Atlantic City.

811
01:10:28,871 --> 01:10:30,668
Took every last dime, but...

812
01:10:31,407 --> 01:10:34,467
...for once in my life
that's exactly what happened.

813
01:10:37,747 --> 01:10:40,079
One way or another

814
01:10:40,216 --> 01:10:41,547
I'm gonna find ya

815
01:10:41,684 --> 01:10:43,549
I'm gonna getcha
getcha getcha getcha.

816
01:10:43,686 --> 01:10:46,018
One day maybe next week

817
01:10:46,155 --> 01:10:47,588
I'm gonna meetcha

818
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:49,554
I'm gonna meetcha I'll meetcha

819
01:10:49,692 --> 01:10:52,160
I will.

820
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:55,629
Drive past your house.

821
01:10:55,765 --> 01:10:58,233
And if.

822
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:01,268
The lights are all down

823
01:11:01,404 --> 01:11:06,501
I'll see who's around...

824
01:11:07,443 --> 01:11:11,038
By the authority vested in me
by the great state of New Jersey...

825
01:11:12,048 --> 01:11:14,949
...in this blessed land of the US of A,

826
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:17,712
I now pronounce you kids man and wife.

827
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:21,020
You may kiss the lucky bride, son.

828
01:11:28,464 --> 01:11:31,592
Now your family and my family
are one big family.

829
01:11:31,734 --> 01:11:33,065
It's how it was meant to be.

830
01:11:39,609 --> 01:11:40,667
Okay, one more.

831
01:12:02,098 --> 01:12:04,760
They're probably out
lookin' for me by now.

832
01:12:06,502 --> 01:12:09,437
You're mine now.
There's no more "them".

833
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:15,707
How am I supposed to feel like this
is real if I can't even tell anyone?

834
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:21,410
We just have to wait a little bit.

835
01:12:23,552 --> 01:12:27,249
In a couple years, when we're both 18,
we can tell everybody.

836
01:12:29,191 --> 01:12:30,920
That's not far away.

837
01:12:32,061 --> 01:12:34,256
That's just what's coming next.

838
01:13:17,273 --> 01:13:19,264
I need to see Willie Riggs.

839
01:13:20,276 --> 01:13:21,300
Who?

840
01:13:22,311 --> 01:13:25,769
Willie. William... Riggs.

841
01:13:27,083 --> 01:13:29,574
He's a black nurse with a green bird.

842
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:31,050
And who are you?

843
01:13:31,187 --> 01:13:34,156
I'm Virginia. His girlfriend.

844
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,781
Well, there's no Willie here anymore.

845
01:13:51,407 --> 01:13:53,170
Can I help you?

846
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:54,435
My baby's comin'.

847
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:57,878
You need to get him.

848
01:13:58,013 --> 01:13:59,605
I... I need him.

849
01:14:00,349 --> 01:14:03,876
The only Willie I know
hasn't been here for quite a while.

850
01:14:05,187 --> 01:14:06,176
Oh!

851
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:09,755
Are you all right?

852
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:15,088
I'm gonna pop!

853
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:18,196
I'm... I'm... I'm gonna pop!

854
01:14:23,405 --> 01:14:26,602
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!!
Don't touch me!!!

855
01:14:50,132 --> 01:14:51,121
Hi.

856
01:14:55,137 --> 01:14:57,605
Take me home. Please.

857
01:14:59,141 --> 01:15:00,802
They're trying to hurt me.

858
01:15:02,878 --> 01:15:05,346
They said you couldn't hardly breathe.

859
01:15:07,249 --> 01:15:10,241
Maybe you need to go to a county hospital.
Please.

860
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:13,453
Just take me home.

861
01:15:13,454 --> 01:15:14,754
Just take me home.

862
01:15:17,293 --> 01:15:18,282
Okay.

863
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,894
Okay. We're goin' home.

864
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,417
I lost my baby, Emmett.

865
01:15:47,156 --> 01:15:48,316
I know.

866
01:15:49,191 --> 01:15:50,215
Hey.

867
01:16:18,621 --> 01:16:22,022
You know that saying,
"You can never go home again"?

868
01:16:23,692 --> 01:16:26,820
It started makin' a whole lot of sense
after that weekend.

869
01:16:28,964 --> 01:16:31,330
In the 24 hours I was gone,

870
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:34,664
Dale had ditched out on his bail
and was hidin' out with Max,

871
01:16:34,803 --> 01:16:36,964
who'd gotten off for lack of evidence,

872
01:16:37,106 --> 01:16:39,165
and I bet was sweet on Dale.

873
01:16:41,243 --> 01:16:44,735
My ma, she would hardly
get out of bed anymore.

874
01:16:47,650 --> 01:16:49,345
Show me some proof.

875
01:16:51,053 --> 01:16:53,749
Damn it, Emmett, I warned you.

876
01:16:54,957 --> 01:16:57,391
What?
Betty, what's wrong with my ma?

877
01:16:59,728 --> 01:17:02,162
Come here. Sit down.

878
01:17:07,703 --> 01:17:08,931
Oh, fuck.

879
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:15,409
Listen, Emmett, this is all hush-hush-
double-pinky-swear kinda shit, okay?

880
01:17:23,252 --> 01:17:26,619
Your momma tried to rob my bank.
Now I covered for her,

881
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:30,020
but she came in there
and made a circus out of it.

882
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:32,724
Fuck you, Betty.
What's really wrong with her?

883
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:35,591
Well, there's all kinds
of things really wrong with her, Em.

884
01:17:35,731 --> 01:17:37,926
Why's she so sick all the time?

885
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:43,496
Maybe it's best if you ask her
about all that yourself, okay?

886
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,666
- You know she won't tell me.
- Oh, lord, Em.

887
01:17:51,413 --> 01:17:52,471
Fuck.

888
01:17:54,450 --> 01:17:56,918
Okay. Well...

889
01:17:57,052 --> 01:17:59,612
All I know is that this lady came by here
rantin' and ravin',

890
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:02,849
and she's the one who told me,
so I only know it from her.

891
01:18:02,992 --> 01:18:06,291
It's somethin' wrong with her lungs.

892
01:18:06,428 --> 01:18:09,591
Stuff's growin'... up in there.

893
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:15,563
But, baby, all I know
is that the next time I saw her,

894
01:18:15,704 --> 01:18:18,639
she was askin' for money
like her life depended on it.

895
01:18:18,774 --> 01:18:20,867
And I tried like hell to help her,

896
01:18:21,010 --> 01:18:23,570
but she screws things up all the time.

897
01:18:24,913 --> 01:18:26,904
But that's not your fault.

898
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,176
You gotta live your life now.

899
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,222
I need some money.

900
01:18:42,031 --> 01:18:43,498
It's just things are...

901
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:46,991
...well, kinda tight for me right now.

902
01:18:55,044 --> 01:18:57,308
It's the moment a lot of people
have been waiting for.

903
01:18:57,446 --> 01:18:59,914
It's a big day along the boardwalk.
The Governor and Sheriff Tipton

904
01:19:00,049 --> 01:19:02,074
are expected to arrive any moment
to address the crowd.

905
01:19:02,217 --> 01:19:04,048
A lot of the streets downtown
are blocked off

906
01:19:04,186 --> 01:19:05,778
and the state right now has been...

907
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:19,899
I'd be lyin' if I said
I hadn't thought about it

908
01:19:20,035 --> 01:19:21,969
a million times before,

909
01:19:22,104 --> 01:19:24,504
every time I put that money
in the slot at night.

910
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,873
One day's take is all I needed
to be home free.

911
01:19:28,644 --> 01:19:32,944
Get Jessie. Get my mom a doctor
out in California.

912
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:34,777
And hell, I knew better than anybody

913
01:19:34,917 --> 01:19:37,511
that Labour Day was the busiest day
of the year.

914
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:39,848
I got it, honey. Half hour. Go.

915
01:19:42,357 --> 01:19:43,688
Get outta here.

916
01:19:43,826 --> 01:19:45,817
And where
would everybody be lookin'?

917
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:48,156
At the future president.

918
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:50,458
So I figured,
if you're gonna do it,

919
01:19:50,599 --> 01:19:52,260
may as well do it right.

920
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,246
Hey.

921
01:20:13,355 --> 01:20:14,720
Here you go.

922
01:20:15,424 --> 01:20:16,721
Thank you.

923
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,893
Mrs. Tipton, your dress is as good as new.

924
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:28,361
I'm going down to the stage, yeah.
You need anything?

925
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:31,268
No, I... I think we're all right.

926
01:20:32,274 --> 01:20:33,639
Thanks, Max.

927
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:37,841
Ah, maybe I'll get you a surprise anyway.

928
01:20:40,983 --> 01:20:42,041
Goodbye.

929
01:20:42,184 --> 01:20:43,811
- Bye, Max.

930
01:20:47,589 --> 01:20:48,749
Shin-Lee?

931
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:50,483
Yes, Mrs. Tipton?

932
01:20:53,462 --> 01:20:55,362
What do they say about me?

933
01:20:57,199 --> 01:21:00,999
Roseanna, in a little town,
everybody has too much to say.

934
01:21:01,136 --> 01:21:02,899
Don't worry yourself.

935
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:05,831
Are they... jealous?

936
01:21:06,775 --> 01:21:07,764
No.

937
01:21:10,445 --> 01:21:12,208
Is it my personality?

938
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:18,676
Shin-Lee, please tell me.

939
01:21:47,049 --> 01:21:49,449
We gotta hurry.
I can't be late back from my break.

940
01:21:56,725 --> 01:21:58,818
I can't talk,
otherwise they'll know it's me, so...

941
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:01,122
- Can you read this?
- Yeah.

942
01:22:01,263 --> 01:22:03,128
I'm not a complete fuckin' idiot.

943
01:22:06,501 --> 01:22:09,664
The Sheriff's Patrol have a gift
for somebody like that.

944
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:12,831
And that's a one-way ticket
to the county jail.

945
01:22:20,148 --> 01:22:21,877
She having his baby.

946
01:23:36,491 --> 01:23:38,516
We're here at the boardwalk,
where hundreds of people

947
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:42,096
are anxiously awaiting the governor.
We've just got word that he is on his way.

948
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:45,131
He will be speaking here,
along with Sheriff Tipton,

949
01:23:45,267 --> 01:23:48,259
who's running for State Senate.
A local band is here...

950
01:24:31,179 --> 01:24:32,510
Why...

951
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:08,580
Tipton, go to hell!
Tipton, go to hell!...

952
01:25:11,753 --> 01:25:14,221
Hi.

953
01:25:16,491 --> 01:25:18,220
Where's your friend?

954
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:20,890
You wanted both of us?

955
01:25:22,297 --> 01:25:23,730
I don't know.

956
01:25:25,033 --> 01:25:26,398
Can you do it alone?

957
01:25:27,869 --> 01:25:31,669
Well, are we... doing
official church business... for real?

958
01:25:33,708 --> 01:25:36,006
What'd you think I was callin' you for?

959
01:25:36,144 --> 01:25:37,509
Hanky-panky?

960
01:25:57,332 --> 01:25:59,300
Tony always tended bar.

961
01:25:59,434 --> 01:26:01,459
Across a crowded floor.

962
01:26:01,603 --> 01:26:03,628
They worked from 8 till 4

963
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:06,400
Oh, my God. Holy lord.

964
01:26:06,541 --> 01:26:08,634
Put the money in the bag!

965
01:26:08,777 --> 01:26:11,940
At the Copa Copacabana
Copacabana.

966
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:16,144
The hottest spot north of Havana
Here.

967
01:26:16,284 --> 01:26:21,153
At the Copa Copacabana
That's it. Move your ass.

968
01:26:21,289 --> 01:26:24,747
Music and passion...
Yeah. Where's the rest, asshole?

969
01:26:24,893 --> 01:26:26,417
There's no money yet.

970
01:26:26,561 --> 01:26:28,188
Not in here.

971
01:26:43,678 --> 01:26:45,145
Make a drag.

972
01:26:48,717 --> 01:26:50,742
Drop. Make a drop.

973
01:26:50,886 --> 01:26:52,319
Now, asshole.

974
01:26:54,022 --> 01:26:55,512
Ladies and gentlemen,

975
01:26:55,657 --> 01:26:57,818
the governor of this great state...

976
01:26:57,959 --> 01:26:59,756
It's best if it's nice and quiet.

977
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,256
Well, you know what's best.

978
01:27:12,407 --> 01:27:13,533
Wilma!

979
01:27:14,342 --> 01:27:17,607
- You ready for my break?
- You need to make a deposit now.

980
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:19,441
- But I've gotta do my count first.
- No.

981
01:27:19,581 --> 01:27:22,482
Wilma, don't worry about counting it today.

982
01:27:22,617 --> 01:27:24,608
What the hell do you mean?

983
01:27:28,657 --> 01:27:30,750
I'm gonna make a drop, baby.

984
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:37,697
Come on! Tipton, go to hell!

985
01:27:48,243 --> 01:27:49,676
Look out, look out.

986
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:43,789
Oh, my God! They've got a gun!
Oh, my God!

987
01:28:44,599 --> 01:28:45,964
Oh, my God, they've got a gun!

988
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:03,149
Shit.

989
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,288
Dale?

990
01:29:14,262 --> 01:29:17,356
- Drop your weapon.
- Hold it right there!

991
01:29:19,434 --> 01:29:20,401
Drop it!

992
01:29:30,211 --> 01:29:32,577
Oh, fuck, I'm bleedin'!

993
01:29:32,714 --> 01:29:35,182
We have a shot fired
on the boardwalk.

994
01:29:35,316 --> 01:29:37,284
Shot fired at the suspect.
Max...

995
01:30:05,847 --> 01:30:07,178
Dear Heavenly Father,

996
01:30:07,315 --> 01:30:10,443
we come today
and ask you for a blessing...

997
01:30:37,946 --> 01:30:39,675
Oh, God! No, please.

998
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:42,510
Get in the closet. Now!
Get in.

999
01:30:46,888 --> 01:30:50,153
- What the hell are you doin' in my dress?
- Nothin'.

1000
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:53,952
It's a misunderstandin'.

1001
01:30:54,095 --> 01:30:56,893
What the hell kinda misunderstandin',
Emmett?

1002
01:31:00,034 --> 01:31:01,592
V?

1003
01:31:01,736 --> 01:31:04,136
There's 100 cops swarmin' outside.
What the hell's going on? I.

1004
01:31:04,272 --> 01:31:07,571
- Hold on, Betty.
Emmett, give me my gun.

1005
01:31:08,543 --> 01:31:12,138
Emmett! Give me my gun
and go take my dress off right now!

1006
01:31:14,415 --> 01:31:15,746
Hello?

1007
01:31:16,851 --> 01:31:17,909
Hey.

1008
01:31:18,052 --> 01:31:19,986
Did you tell somebody
about, you know...

1009
01:31:20,121 --> 01:31:21,349
What? About what?

1010
01:31:21,489 --> 01:31:24,424
That's right, V.
Now, what the hell are you gonna do?

1011
01:31:24,559 --> 01:31:26,083
I don't know. Uh...

1012
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:28,952
Well, Emmett just came home...

1013
01:31:29,097 --> 01:31:32,123
and he's locked a Mormon boy
up in the closet.

1014
01:31:32,267 --> 01:31:35,236
Oh, shit, V. You have a hostage?

1015
01:31:35,370 --> 01:31:37,235
Wait. Hold on. I got another call.

1016
01:31:40,108 --> 01:31:41,939
Who is this?

1017
01:31:43,278 --> 01:31:45,576
It's Virginia. Who's this?

1018
01:31:45,713 --> 01:31:47,772
This is Officer Lee.
I'm right outside.

1019
01:31:48,483 --> 01:31:49,916
Are you alone in there?

1020
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:51,849
Uh...

1021
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:54,085
Not really.

1022
01:31:55,390 --> 01:31:57,153
Who else is in there?

1023
01:31:58,693 --> 01:31:59,819
- Ma'am.
- Uh...

1024
01:32:01,863 --> 01:32:04,457
Well... for starters...

1025
01:32:05,466 --> 01:32:06,831
...there's a...

1026
01:32:06,968 --> 01:32:09,493
a Mormon boy in my closet.

1027
01:32:10,471 --> 01:32:14,066
Can you call me back in five minutes?
I got someone on the other line.

1028
01:32:18,746 --> 01:32:20,680
What the fuck did you do?

1029
01:32:20,815 --> 01:32:23,648
We just gotta get out back.
I know a way they won't catch us.

1030
01:32:23,785 --> 01:32:25,150
Oh, fuck.

1031
01:32:25,787 --> 01:32:27,812
Em. Emmett.

1032
01:32:27,956 --> 01:32:29,924
We're gettin' out of here.

1033
01:32:30,058 --> 01:32:32,686
Virginia, send out whoever you got in there

1034
01:32:32,827 --> 01:32:35,022
or we're gonna have to come inl

1035
01:32:39,067 --> 01:32:41,058
Go close up my suitcase.

1036
01:32:41,202 --> 01:32:43,670
I can't get the lock to lock. Go on.

1037
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:48,265
The governor has left town
and will not be attending

1038
01:32:48,409 --> 01:32:50,639
the local Labour Day barbecue
as planned.

1039
01:32:50,778 --> 01:32:54,578
Police have shut down the stage area
of the boardwalk indefinitely.

1040
01:32:54,716 --> 01:32:57,344
Now we're also hearing
that police have surrounded

1041
01:32:57,485 --> 01:32:58,952
a small home near Oceana.

1042
01:33:06,027 --> 01:33:07,051
Mom?

1043
01:33:37,725 --> 01:33:40,785
Hi. Give me your clothes, quick like.

1044
01:33:40,929 --> 01:33:43,193
Come on, take 'em off.

1045
01:33:43,331 --> 01:33:45,492
If you could, my son's here now too,

1046
01:33:45,633 --> 01:33:48,500
so... I was wondering if, uh...

1047
01:33:51,973 --> 01:33:52,997
Hey.

1048
01:33:53,975 --> 01:33:57,206
Those underwear.
Those are the magic blessed kind, right?

1049
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:02,416
- They're not really magic.
- Bull. You give me those, too. Come on.

1050
01:34:03,918 --> 01:34:07,684
So I was just wonderin'...
'Cause he's here now, my boy, um...

1051
01:34:09,424 --> 01:34:11,949
...do you think you could say
a little prayer for him, too?

1052
01:34:12,093 --> 01:34:15,290
Yes, ma'am.
- Okay. Thank you.

1053
01:34:15,430 --> 01:34:19,457
Okay, now put this on your head.
Here's your tape.

1054
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,898
You tape it around the neck
so it don't come off.

1055
01:34:27,508 --> 01:34:29,908
Put those on. That's your disguise.

1056
01:34:31,279 --> 01:34:33,611
- You need to put some shoes on.
- No, Emmett.

1057
01:34:33,748 --> 01:34:35,272
You put his clothes on.

1058
01:34:36,217 --> 01:34:37,775
Emmett, do as I say.

1059
01:34:39,554 --> 01:34:41,283
Emmett, do as I say.

1060
01:34:42,357 --> 01:34:43,915
Emmett, listen to me.

1061
01:34:44,058 --> 01:34:45,992
Come here.
You put his clothes on right now.

1062
01:34:46,661 --> 01:34:47,593
You stop it!

1063
01:34:49,197 --> 01:34:50,994
You put those Mormon clothes on!

1064
01:34:51,132 --> 01:34:54,829
I was just trying to get us what we need
so we can get to San Fran and...

1065
01:34:54,969 --> 01:34:59,997
That is not your job! That is my job!!!
You're puttin' it in my face,

1066
01:35:00,141 --> 01:35:04,237
just like every other fucker
out there puts it in my face!

1067
01:35:04,379 --> 01:35:08,008
I know I'm a shit-ass mom!
I know that already!

1068
01:35:08,716 --> 01:35:09,978
No, you're not.

1069
01:35:11,386 --> 01:35:13,479
Don't you make me swat you again.

1070
01:35:14,589 --> 01:35:16,682
You put those goddamn clothes on.

1071
01:35:16,824 --> 01:35:18,655
Magic underwear first.

1072
01:35:35,576 --> 01:35:38,044
115, respond to Atlantic and Shore Drive.

1073
01:35:42,316 --> 01:35:44,113
115, copy.

1074
01:35:44,252 --> 01:35:46,516
And dear Lord,
please let each of us

1075
01:35:46,654 --> 01:35:48,952
come out of this in one piece.

1076
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:52,184
- And let our travels be safe.
- That's it.

1077
01:35:52,326 --> 01:35:55,090
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

1078
01:35:55,530 --> 01:35:56,588
Amen.

1079
01:35:57,899 --> 01:36:00,390
Virginia,
pick up the phone.

1080
01:36:00,535 --> 01:36:02,833
The Sheriff wants to talk to you.

1081
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:21,521
Hello?

1082
01:36:21,656 --> 01:36:23,624
Hello, Virginia.

1083
01:36:24,625 --> 01:36:27,423
Well, it's been a long time, Dick.

1084
01:36:27,562 --> 01:36:31,430
I've been...
meaning to call you.

1085
01:36:31,566 --> 01:36:34,057
Virgin... Virginia, what's going on?

1086
01:36:34,202 --> 01:36:36,830
Oh... this and that.

1087
01:36:39,373 --> 01:36:41,568
I became a real Mormon for you.

1088
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:43,868
How about you?

1089
01:36:44,479 --> 01:36:48,245
Virginia, I need you to let
whoever you've got in there come out.

1090
01:36:48,382 --> 01:36:50,213
Will you do that for me?

1091
01:36:50,351 --> 01:36:51,943
I wanna see you, Dick.

1092
01:36:52,086 --> 01:36:54,953
How about you come in here
and talk with me for a little bit?

1093
01:36:55,089 --> 01:36:57,614
Yeah, as soon as they...
Y'know, as soon as they come out,

1094
01:36:57,758 --> 01:36:59,885
we'll sit down and talk for a while.

1095
01:37:01,562 --> 01:37:02,927
Did you miss me?

1096
01:37:07,702 --> 01:37:09,294
Yeah. Yes, I did.

1097
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:17,377
I've been thinkin' a lot
about our future heaven babies.

1098
01:37:19,113 --> 01:37:21,581
I've decided they should be yellow.

1099
01:37:21,716 --> 01:37:23,877
Not like Shin-Lee-at-the-cleaners yellow,
real yellow,

1100
01:37:24,018 --> 01:37:26,248
like canaries. Okay, Virginia.

1101
01:37:26,387 --> 01:37:28,787
We'll talk all about it
as soon you let everyone go.

1102
01:37:29,991 --> 01:37:31,049
Okay.

1103
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,760
Give me a minute.
Yeah, one minute.

1104
01:37:36,764 --> 01:37:38,356
Hand me my purse.

1105
01:37:57,318 --> 01:37:59,684
You will be careful with yourself,
won't you?

1106
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:02,012
Yes.

1107
01:38:08,829 --> 01:38:10,660
Can I throw that away?

1108
01:38:27,882 --> 01:38:31,215
- I don't wanna do it like this.
- You gotta get out of here, Emmett.

1109
01:38:31,352 --> 01:38:34,685
We'll figure out the rest of it later, okay?
Where do we meet up?

1110
01:38:36,090 --> 01:38:38,650
Head out to California with your girl.

1111
01:38:39,527 --> 01:38:41,119
Find my sister,

1112
01:38:41,262 --> 01:38:44,254
go take pictures on that Golden Bridge
in San Francisco.

1113
01:38:44,398 --> 01:38:46,923
You can mail 'em back to Betty
and she'll find me, okay?

1114
01:38:47,068 --> 01:38:49,195
When are you comin'?

1115
01:38:49,337 --> 01:38:51,100
I'm comin' real soon.

1116
01:38:52,340 --> 01:38:56,333
You just let that girl of yours
take care of you a little for now, okay?

1117
01:38:56,477 --> 01:38:58,843
You've earned that.
I'll catch up.

1118
01:38:59,814 --> 01:39:03,341
- I don't want to.
- Emmett...

1119
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:05,884
If anything ever happened to you,

1120
01:39:06,020 --> 01:39:07,715
then I just might as well be dead.

1121
01:39:08,889 --> 01:39:10,379
Do you hear me?

1122
01:39:11,959 --> 01:39:14,086
So don't be a hero.

1123
01:39:14,228 --> 01:39:15,820
I want you to go out there

1124
01:39:15,963 --> 01:39:19,626
and I want you to make a break for it
as soon as the coast is clear, okay?

1125
01:39:20,935 --> 01:39:21,993
Okay.

1126
01:39:22,837 --> 01:39:24,498
Now...

1127
01:39:24,639 --> 01:39:27,767
I made us some egg-salad sandwiches
for the trip.

1128
01:39:27,908 --> 01:39:30,900
They're in the luggage.
You can eat mine, too.

1129
01:39:35,616 --> 01:39:37,174
I love you, Mom.

1130
01:39:38,619 --> 01:39:40,314
I love you.

1131
01:39:43,190 --> 01:39:45,590
We're peas and carrots, you and me.

1132
01:39:47,528 --> 01:39:49,120
Peas and carrots.

1133
01:40:00,808 --> 01:40:02,435
Okay.

1134
01:40:02,576 --> 01:40:04,567
Now you get outta here.

1135
01:40:04,712 --> 01:40:06,179
Hey, let's go.

1136
01:41:22,690 --> 01:41:24,954
Don't do it, Dick-lick.

1137
01:41:34,168 --> 01:41:35,499
Cut it out.

1138
01:42:51,078 --> 01:42:52,443
Go ahead, 413.

1139
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:54,605
We have a deceased white female.

1140
01:42:56,116 --> 01:42:58,414
Request coroner on the scene.

1141
01:43:03,390 --> 01:43:05,984
Copy that, 413. 1428.

1142
01:44:00,614 --> 01:44:04,550
All the police and reporters
were too busy lookin' at my mom,

1143
01:44:04,685 --> 01:44:06,346
the lady everybody thinks

1144
01:44:06,487 --> 01:44:09,354
kept the governor
from stickin' around for a barbecue.

1145
01:44:10,224 --> 01:44:12,124
I just started runnin'
towards Jessie's house.

1146
01:44:18,799 --> 01:44:20,664
I just wanted to see her one more time.

1147
01:44:24,071 --> 01:44:27,199
But it looks like they'll be
getting me now, too.

1148
01:44:30,711 --> 01:44:32,702
- Keep those cameras away.
- Yes, sir.

1149
01:44:40,387 --> 01:44:41,718
Willie...

1150
01:44:42,923 --> 01:44:46,051
Did the Mormons have it right
about me going to heaven?

1151
01:44:48,495 --> 01:44:52,261
I got baptized by the Catholics,
and saved by the Baptists, too,

1152
01:44:52,399 --> 01:44:54,867
so that's gotta count for somethin'.

1153
01:44:59,173 --> 01:45:01,164
I fucked up again, Willie.

1154
01:45:03,544 --> 01:45:07,605
He's the only thing
I ever wanted to do right in my whole life.

1155
01:45:08,782 --> 01:45:10,374
I fucked him up.

1156
01:45:12,052 --> 01:45:13,041
No.

1157
01:45:14,388 --> 01:45:16,219
You know what I think?

1158
01:45:17,825 --> 01:45:19,622
I'd say that...

1159
01:45:19,760 --> 01:45:21,284
for the next 30 minutes,

1160
01:45:21,428 --> 01:45:22,952
Mr. Sheriff Tipton...

1161
01:45:23,097 --> 01:45:25,088
is gonna look like a good lawman.

1162
01:45:25,232 --> 01:45:27,200
Lawman with heart.

1163
01:45:27,334 --> 01:45:30,667
And all those reporters
are gonna head over to his house,

1164
01:45:30,804 --> 01:45:33,102
where the governor
was supposed to have his barbeque,

1165
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:36,107
and they're going to find his wife
high as a kite,

1166
01:45:36,243 --> 01:45:38,643
and she is gonna be spreadin'
those dirty pictures

1167
01:45:38,779 --> 01:45:40,269
all over the front lawn.

1168
01:45:48,589 --> 01:45:50,113
And your boy...

1169
01:45:51,959 --> 01:45:54,257
...he's gonna be all right.

1170
01:45:54,395 --> 01:45:55,885
Yes. Yes, he is.

1171
01:46:18,552 --> 01:46:20,144
And those two love birds

1172
01:46:20,287 --> 01:46:23,085
are gonna get a place together
right out there by the ocean,

1173
01:46:23,223 --> 01:46:24,656
right up under that Golden Bridge,

1174
01:46:24,792 --> 01:46:28,455
and make perfect, happy babies.
Lots of 'em.

1175
01:46:29,797 --> 01:46:31,389
How's that sound?

1176
01:46:36,136 --> 01:46:37,694
How about you...

1177
01:46:37,838 --> 01:46:40,329
How about you try
and get some sleep now?

1178
01:46:43,811 --> 01:46:44,869
Okay.

1179
01:46:47,614 --> 01:46:49,309
You did fine today.

1180
01:46:52,386 --> 01:46:54,149
Just fine.
