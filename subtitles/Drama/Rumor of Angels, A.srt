1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Heard it Through the Grapevine

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:07,250
<i>Episode 29</i>

3
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:51,140
Is there something wrong
in Yi Ji's room?

4
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,520
Well, ma'am...

5
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,290
It's not her room.

6
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:59,560
I was just checking to see
if the walls are damp around here.

7
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,800
Good job.

8
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:20,170
<i>Big Missus is going up.</i>

9
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,310
Are you sleeping?

10
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,980
Are you here, Yi Ji?

11
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes, what is it?

12
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,840
What are you doing here?

13
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,030
I'm picking a book to read.

14
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,310
We thought you were sleeping, ma'am.

15
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:57,430
I was just going through
some winter clothes.

16
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:58,770
Are you not sleepy?

17
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,980
It's not that late.
Why do you want me to sleep so early?

18
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,550
Aren't you going home?

19
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,420
I was helping her. It's not like I have
anything to do at home anyway.

20
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,230
Why?
You must go on a date with Mr. Dok.

21
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,040
I can't do it every day.

22
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,960
Collect all In Sang's clothes
and sell them to the shop.

23
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,230
Mom...

24
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,470
I'm sure he had other plans when he decided
to run away without anything.

25
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,880
Do as I say.

26
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,300
Yes, ma'am.

27
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,030
Good night, ma'am.

28
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,090
Get rid of that.

29
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,640
Yes, ma'am.

30
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,750
[Silence]

31
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,380
President Han said he'll be home late.

32
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,680
Okay.

33
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,010
All washed up, Jin Young?

34
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,810
Feeling great?

35
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,240
It's chilly!
Let's get dressed!

36
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,550
How cute!

37
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,480
Come here!

38
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,380
You're hungry, aren't you?

39
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,340
<i>I'm home!</i>

40
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:09,680
Okay.

41
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,970
Just a moment, please!

42
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,530
You can either come in or leave.

43
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,620
Is someone else here?

44
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,940
My friends.

45
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,270
It's me!

46
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,740
- Hello!
- Wow, it's the baby!

47
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,520
We carried around In Sang's luggage
in my car the whole day.

48
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,930
I had to lie to my chauffeur!

49
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,590
Thank you!

50
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,300
I was worried because we don't have
enough money to buy new clothes for him.

51
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,110
Come on in.

52
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,310
Shall we sit down?
We have guests!

53
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,220
I figured you might be concerned
if I told you in advance.

54
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,290
So I just brought them.

55
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,550
That's fine.

56
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,650
You have everything you need!

57
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,080
Quite wondrous, isn't it?

58
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,580
It looks like a movie set.

59
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,160
How do you have a sex life here?
Do you even have one?

60
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,550
Do you play music and muffle
each other's mouth?

61
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:34,230
- Guys...
- Sit down.

62
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,630
Sit.

63
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:38,100
You must thank me.

64
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,950
She says she was very direct
with In Sang's mother that day.

65
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,360
That's why she gave up.

66
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,070
Don't try to take credit for
what you didn't do.

67
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,780
You're the one who
thanked me that day.

68
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,560
I thank you for telling her
the truth...

69
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,760
But she hasn't given up yet.

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,800
Really?
Even though you're living like this?

71
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,240
I guess she's waiting to see
how long he'll last.

72
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,220
Frankly, I'm the same.
Wouldn't he get sick of this life?

73
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:02,790
Don't let go of In Sang.

74
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,500
I loved seeing the mothers being speechless.

75
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,360
It sounds like you're using us.

76
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,740
That's right!
She wants you to be on her side.

77
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,240
Please use us frequently!

78
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,890
I will.

79
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,550
You all have the spirit of evil!

80
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,000
We must make her give up completely!

81
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,350
I wonder if that's even possible.

82
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:23,430
We must make it possible.

83
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,810
What if you can't?

84
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:32,060
Yi Ji is quite smart.
She knew exactly what we needed...

85
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,140
Yes.

86
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,740
I told her to bring me the things
that I used to use.

87
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,300
Is that okay?

88
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,250
Of course it is!

89
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,270
I don't want to offend
your generosity...

90
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:44,940
You're not offending anyone!

91
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,100
It'd be great if I can buy you
everything brand new, but...

92
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,280
We can't give you anything
monetary...

93
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,850
But we can give you our hearts!

94
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:56,010
Yes, of course I know!

95
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:58,070
We're glad that you know.

96
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,490
You're only getting compliments these days!

97
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,330
I'm not sure if they'll be able to live on.
His parents won't give up so easily!

98
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,680
Well...

99
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,890
It'd be great if they can
visit each other and stuff...

100
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:27,020
but the problem is that they're all out
to cut ties with each other!

101
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:31,360
Look at this cutie!

102
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,900
I can't cut ties with this cute one!

103
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,390
It all depends on your father, Jin Young!

104
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,630
Just stop caring!

105
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,700
He'll come back sooner if
we don't show any lingering affection.

106
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,350
Don't call him, and
certainly don't go to see him!

107
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:48,060
Of course.

108
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,130
Go home.
The spinach soup is good tonight.

109
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,800
Okay.
Almost done.

110
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,220
That's not necessary.

111
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,770
I'm done with my classes early today.
I'll be back around two.

112
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,170
Can you come over here?

113
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,930
Why?
Is something wrong?

114
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,320
No.

115
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:30,710
Don't try too hard.
You can't wear yourself out too much.

116
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,740
Okay.

117
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,390
See you later.

118
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,420
I'm leaving!

119
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,720
- Goodbye.
- Take care!

120
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,050
Okay.

121
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,740
Hello!

122
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,690
I assume your graveyard shift
is pretty tiring!

123
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:53,010
No, I'm fine.

124
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:56,650
I've used the bathroom outside already.
You don't have to leave early because of me.

125
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:00,160
You care too much about everything!
Just don't fall asleep during class!

126
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
Okay, goodbye!

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,920
<i>Come up!</i>

128
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,530
I'm coming!

129
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:14,220
I don't know if the owner is making any money
after hiring two part-time workers.

130
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:18,610
The owner has another job.
And the store is paid off too.

131
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:21,340
It'd be difficult for him to survive
if the store was his only source of income.

132
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,060
A lot of convenience stores
are closing these days.

133
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,820
But the new ones keep popping up.

134
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,020
That's what's so crazy.

135
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,750
I guess you're curious about
how laypeople survive.

136
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,480
Yes...
Now that it has become my problem...

137
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,560
But I'm concerned.
Both of you should continue your studies.

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,460
I've applied for a part-time job
at my school.

139
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:48,990
There are not many openings
these days though...

140
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:51,290
But a job there will be better
than the job at the store.

141
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,760
Bom will be able to take a break too.

142
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,900
Wouldn't it be great if the government
takes care of all that?

143
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:02,720
They should support student parents!
That'll encourage people to have more babies!

144
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,490
That's right.

145
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:08,470
I don't know if such day will come.

146
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,040
You must be tired because of Jin Young.

147
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:16,460
Don't be sorry.
I may be tired, but he's still cute!

148
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,200
How cute!

149
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,150
We're sorry for your parents.
Only we get to enjoy his cuteness.

150
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:25,320
They must be missing him.

151
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,860
There's nothing I can do.

152
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:39,880
I'm being very cold.
But why is there no response?

153
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,370
Be honest.

154
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,340
Yes, sure...

155
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:53,920
I'll pinpoint two mistakes
of you and your husband.

156
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,240
First, the fact that you tried to
secretly give money to your in-laws.

157
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,460
Second, the fact that you changed
the content of the contract.

158
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,860
Those were very dishonorable...

159
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:08,320
I'm sorry.

160
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,810
Those were a bit extreme.

161
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:23,170
Figure out a time for that place.

162
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,080
Okay.

163
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,570
<i>Be careful.
They might resort to foul play.</i>

164
00:11:55,570 --> 00:12:02,300
There used to be a time when
the whole country got riled up...

165
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:08,260
by the smallest moral indeficiency
of the prime ministerial candidate.

166
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,480
But now...

167
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,770
people don't expect everything to be perfect
about the candidate.

168
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,460
People don't care about shady real estate
transactions or military service problems!

169
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:23,070
Because that's what everyone in the
top one percent of this country does...

170
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,410
everyone wants to do them too
instead of getting angry at them.

171
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,010
Have you ever heard?

172
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:38,120
"Enlighten! By that, people will
fall into deeper sleep."

173
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,170
The people who used to be intoxicated by their
shallow knowledge of how this world works...

174
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:47,330
are now all sleeping!

175
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:55,560
I don't have to try so hard.

176
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,570
There's no need for me to pay a lot of money
for your informational reports.

177
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,280
So you finally feel threatened by me.

178
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,050
I thought you've become completely
desensitized.

179
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,080
I like to see that.

180
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,390
What should I give you
as my final gift?

181
00:13:17,450 --> 00:13:20,600
Don't rush it.

182
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,890
You should stay at least until
the confirmation hearing is done.

183
00:13:24,890 --> 00:13:32,390
Let's see if I'm right or wrong
together.

184
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:34,010
I will.

185
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:12,100
You're not allowed to join them
to prepare for the confirmation hearing?

186
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,270
That's right.

187
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,400
He has transferred your work
to Secretary Yang.

188
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,620
I know.

189
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:21,280
Apparently there has been a deal.

190
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:26,090
President Han will turn a blind eye
to Secretary Yang's slush funds.

191
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,340
You often tell me juicy things.

192
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,360
I've done my time in this place.

193
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,750
Thank you.

194
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,980
I hope it'll be helpful.

195
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,400
I'm sure it wil be.

196
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:47,650
So all these are the new facts
that we just found out?

197
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,310
Yes, sir.

198
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,260
They must be added to the
list of things you know already.

199
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,250
I'm sorry to say this...

200
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,290
but he's a complete package
of corruption.

201
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,840
His son dodged the military draft
by coming up with a fake excuse.

202
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:04,140
His wife is involved in real estate
manipulation along with tax evasion.

203
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:10,110
His brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law...
How astonishing!

204
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:18,960
Why is everyone in the gutter?

205
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,010
I can't look at these anymore.

206
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:26,150
They studied law to join the
top one percent of Korea!

207
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,790
Then they should have known their limit!

208
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,390
They should have some sense of
social responsibility left in them!

209
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,090
I'll prepare a mock questionnaire.

210
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:38,370
His conscience gets covered up because
people like us keep protecting him!

211
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,130
I urge you to focus on the goal, sir.

212
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,640
Right.

213
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:52,970
Let's forget about my emotions,
for bigger things.

214
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,870
I think this is about everything.

215
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,690
Send a copy to the candidate.

216
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,520
Tell him to bring his PR man
to the rehearsal.

217
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,150
Yes, sir.

218
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,830
- He's here, sir.
- Bring him in.

219
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:13,240
- I'll take my leave, sir.
- Go ahead.

220
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,170
Welcome, sir!

221
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,500
I heard the preparation is done.

222
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,680
Yes, sir.

223
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,410
I'm sorry to cause you all this trouble.

224
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:25,380
Not at all.
Please sit down.

225
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,980
You must be busy.

226
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,310
Now I have to find a person
who'll ask questions during the rehearsal.

227
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:49,230
It seems like you've used
your last card.

228
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,860
I had no other choice.

229
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,930
The man is a piece of garbage,
but we must get him confirmed.

230
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,340
I bet.

231
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,110
I'm sorry that I've taken your work away.

232
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:05,630
But do you know what I did
in the past 32 hours?

233
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:10,630
I lived with the candidate in his house
and made him tell me everything.

234
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:14,410
I didn't see the need to do an investigation
like you.

235
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,890
Like what President Han often says...

236
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,750
"Tell me everything."

237
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,660
"One who confesses shall be
exempted from punishment."

238
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:29,900
No one will know our sins
better than ourselves.

239
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,320
I guess it'd be easy to prepare
for the answers.

240
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:38,260
As long as he doesn't do something stupid.

241
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:43,200
I'm still nervous even though
you're spoon-feeding me.

242
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,360
There's something special about that seat.

243
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,070
I haven't done an interview since
the time when I took the bar exam!

244
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,760
There'll be some sort of aggression.

245
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:00,140
The opposition has a part
they must play too.

246
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,320
I am aware of that.

247
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,600
Well...

248
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,000
Here's to your prompt confirmation!

249
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,570
We should meet up with Prime Minister Song
before he leaves office.

250
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,930
Yes, sir.

251
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:25,940
Wasn't he quite insistent on
leaving his son alone?

252
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:30,450
I'm afraid...

253
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,890
we must reconsider that problem.

254
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,790
Song Jae Won hasn't left the country yet?

255
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:41,790
I don't think it'll be necessary
to get him involved.

256
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,020
How?
Is there something else?

257
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,910
I'm afraid that it might
do us more harm.

258
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,410
It'd be the best to carry this out
as quietly as possible.

259
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,190
Indeed!

260
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:59,110
I'll do my best to block this issue
as soon as I become prime minister.

261
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,650
Everyone is involved!

262
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,480
I believe in you.

263
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,250
It can't be more perfect than that.

264
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:12,340
He'll say everything himself and the preparation
team will make excuses for his shortcomings.

265
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:17,490
I don't think the right questions
will be asked at this rate.

266
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,270
Everyone thinks he'll be confirmed anyway,
so there's no point in asking sharp questions.

267
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:25,700
President Han is hypnotizing
the committee.

268
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,990
We should still make some noise!

269
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,880
But this is making me angry.

270
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,390
I can't believe he said
everyone is asleep.

271
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:40,790
Does the opposition party members
have a similar report as that of Joo Young?

272
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,850
Or do you think they're being careful because
they don't want to reveal anthing either?

273
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:49,250
Three of the committee members
are relatively clean.

274
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,310
His chief of staff went to the
same college as me.

275
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,770
Let's try it.

276
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,720
<i>Let's be more safe.</i>

277
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,850
<i>Try to poach the three staunch
members of the opposition.</i>

278
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:36,210
<i>It won't be difficult.</i>

279
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,090
Meet me first.
I know that much at least.

280
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,350
You can't meet that woman first!

281
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,620
I'll be right there.
Okay.

282
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:55,430
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,570
Change first!

284
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,020
Here.

285
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,330
I'll change in the taxi.

286
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:08,460
That's very uncomfortable!

287
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,520
Would you like to eat this?

288
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,850
Great!
I haven't eaten yet.

289
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,840
So, how did you manage
to come here in the morning?

290
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,570
I have the afternoon shift today.

291
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:37,960
Meeting a man like that
can be extremely risky.

292
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,260
I think so, too.

293
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,350
Or you can take
a bigger risk for a bigger reward.

294
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:53,560
Look here, Jin Young!
Good, Jin Young!

295
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:57,060
One more!
You too, Bom!

296
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,790
My heart is aching.

297
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,550
You can sit down now.

298
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,680
I was told to take
as many pictures as possible.

299
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,360
How's everyone doing?

300
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,050
Depressed.
The whole house feels empty.

301
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,630
How pretty!

302
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:22,710
<i>Big Missus would like to see Jin Young.</i>

303
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,480
<i>I'm sorry, but you will have to
talk to Jin Young's parents.</i>

304
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,700
- Grandma, come here!
- Okay!

305
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:38,780
What if he gets tired?

306
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,210
Smile!

307
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,030
Mommy!
Grandma!

308
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,430
Do you want to just go crazy
and beg for mercy with my brother?

309
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,990
My parents have soft spots too.

310
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,260
Forget it.

311
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,110
Whatever that might come after begging
will be the real problem.

312
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,620
You know it.

313
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,140
There's just no good way out of this.

314
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,970
Just think of this as
the way out.

315
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:17,380
Okay.
Enjoy your life while you can.

316
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,690
I'm sure my parents will
change their minds eventually.

317
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,500
How could you be like that?

318
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,580
Like what?

319
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,790
You know everything.

320
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,300
Bad girl.

321
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,270
You must look at him from afar
as I've told you before.

322
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,740
Why must I?

323
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,710
I've explained it to you
more than enough times already.

324
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,390
I'm good at that too.

325
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,000
I agree, but...

326
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,460
I can't blame anyone else but
In Sang's stupidity.

327
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,170
But you and your husband
provided the original reason.

328
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,590
His mother did!

329
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:31,920
The person in charge has gone
to a meeting at the district office today.

330
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,890
The facility looks pretty good.

331
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:42,080
See if this nursery can be connected to our
firm's corporate social responsibility program.

332
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,460
Yes, sir.

333
00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,500
I've contacted the head of this nursery.
Why don't you look around for now?

334
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,560
Is it going to take a while?

335
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,490
She said she'll be here
as soon as possible.

336
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:20,600
He's just showing off!
I can show off too!

337
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,390
Why are you doing this?

338
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,000
What do you mean?

339
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,650
I thought he's usually here at this hour.

340
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:10,080
Should I look for him?

341
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:16,840
<i>Be careful, he might resort to
foul play.</i>

342
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,580
He is here to see if he can be of any help
to this nursery...

343
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,170
in regard to Hansong's new
corporate social responsibility initiative.

344
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,330
Yes, sir.

345
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:43,050
Why are you alone?
Where is the baby?

346
00:27:43,050 --> 00:27:47,460
Jin Young is with my mother.

347
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:57,510
Let's talk, since I'm here already.

348
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,970
I...

349
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,150
believe there's a serious deficiency
in your motherly instinct.

350
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:35,490
A concern is that as Jin Young's mother, you have
no idea what you're doing to him right now.

351
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,500
The normal thing to do here is
showing me Jin Young right now.

352
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,550
You wish your son to
not know his grandfather?

353
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,730
It's because you did not
keep your promise.

354
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:54,160
You'll be able to see Jin Young again
only when...

355
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:58,660
In Sang and I believe that you're
trustworthy again.

356
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,110
And you'll be the judge of that?

357
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,150
He's not leaving.

358
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:08,030
Why?

359
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:16,400
There's a world of difference between
what you can offer Jin Young...

360
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,070
and what I can offer him!

361
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:19,380
Do you agree?

362
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:21,900
No.

363
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,850
What's your reason?

364
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,980
Aren't you aware of the time
that we live in?

365
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,970
I'll tell you honestly since
there seems to be no one watching us.

366
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:39,800
What are you going to tell me?

367
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,610
I'm sure it'll be very fortunate for a kid to
grow up with the best of everything.

368
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:57,190
But if people like you can use your power
positively to create a system in which...

369
00:29:57,190 --> 00:30:00,680
the kids who are less fortunate can
still grow up to be good citizens...

370
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,770
What I mean is...

371
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:07,980
I hope the kids without rich grandparents
can become successful too...

372
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:18,140
A man will think he's done something generous
every time he does something for others.

373
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,970
But the system doesn't think like that.

374
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:25,810
Are you saying that I show off
my generosity?

375
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm sorry.

376
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:51,490
Delusions are worse than epidemics.
I hope your symptoms won't get any worse.

377
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,900
Goodbye.

378
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:57,830
I'll be watching you.

379
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,570
<i>First floor.
The door is closing.</i>

380
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:22,150
<i>I didn't tell him that you were here.</i>

381
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,010
What should I do about her?

382
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:33,870
How could she show absolutely
no sign of repentance?

383
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:35,370
I'm not sure...

384
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:40,740
You're certain that she didn't see me, right?
Do you think her mom will tell her?

385
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:43,390
I'm not sure about that either.

386
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,980
I'm worried.
We must lay down some rules.

387
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:54,100
That would be pointless.
To them, they make the rules.

388
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:57,060
They should've just said
they miss Jin Young!

389
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,330
Did they think I'd ignore
their feelings for Jin Young?

390
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:03,370
If anything, I understand that they probably
miss Jin Young as mush as I used to!

391
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,540
That doesn't seem to be the case.

392
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,230
Let's go home!

393
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,070
Okay.

394
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:25,200
Everyone including the district chief
was surprised to hear that you paid a visit.

395
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,920
So what did you tell them?

396
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,660
That it was just a tour.

397
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,240
Good job.

398
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,650
I heard you went to somewhere today.

399
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:42,970
Yes.

400
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,610
Where?

401
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:48,600
Tell Secretary Lee to go home.

402
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,020
Okay.

403
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,410
So you're the only one who
knows the whole thing!

404
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,490
Dad is the only one who doesn't know!

405
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,020
What are they doing over
this cute thing?

406
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,010
I guess they can't help
but to be attached to their blood!

407
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:22,320
Doesn't that mean that they should be
willing to give up their pride for him?

408
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,800
How handsome!

409
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,370
How's the preparation for
Mr. Kim's confirmation hearing going?

410
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:32,700
Well.

411
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,030
People are talking about it.

412
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,120
They'll get quiet soon.
Everyone has the brain of a bird.

413
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,920
What kind of brain do you have?

414
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,260
I saw you leaving empty-handed
after making all those calculations.

415
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,250
I did?
From where?

416
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:57,580
Forget about it if you don't know
what I'm talking about.

417
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,440
Did you see me?

418
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:11,220
I told you not to go there.

419
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,740
Tell me if you saw me there!

420
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:21,470
In Sang is very much like you
when it comes to being stupid.

421
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,720
What?

422
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,270
I connected you since
you applied for it...

423
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:36,300
But I still don't understand.

424
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,790
Why a guy like you would apply
to be a part-time tutor.

425
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,170
A guy like me?

426
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,400
Everyone knows that you're studying
for the bar exam...

427
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,050
with the help of the star tutor,
Mr. Dok.

428
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:47,250
Well...

429
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,260
I've put it off due to
personal reasons.

430
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,760
What personal reasons?
Changing your plans?

431
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,410
I'm thinking about it.

432
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,570
Are you not confident?

433
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:00,870
I guess your father also passed it
with flying colors.

434
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,870
I assume the pressure on you
is quite high.

435
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:04,770
I've written this down
on the application form too...

436
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,480
But I'd like to teach kids
that pay well.

437
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,240
Okay, I'll accommodate.
Even though I don't understand.

438
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,260
Look here.

439
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,260
A 10th grader who needs help
with homework in Math and English.

440
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:19,080
You can see the parents
at their home.

441
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,450
The pay is the highest, but the mom
can be quite picky.

442
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,040
I'll go see her.

443
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,680
But what's your reason?
Do your parents know?

444
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,260
No...

445
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:34,700
It doesn't matter if they know.
But...

446
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,930
Nice to see you.

447
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,550
Hello.

448
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,690
Thanks for coming.

449
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:18,730
Not at all.
I must thank you.

450
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,930
Please sit down.

451
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,510
Tea?

452
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,430
The school has confirmed your identity...

453
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:41,600
I see that your father's an attorney?

454
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:44,140
Yes.

455
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:48,610
At a law firm?
Or a private office?

456
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:50,720
The latter.

457
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,940
Where is the office?

458
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,440
Near Gwanghwamoon.

459
00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:00,850
I saw that your address was
One Hangang Street.

460
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,630
Is that an apartment building?

461
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,730
No, it's a private house.

462
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,560
You heard that you'll be helping out
with the schoolwork, right?

463
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,690
Yes.

464
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:17,360
How did you study
for your classes?

465
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,680
I did it my way.

466
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,600
Then you must know very well.

467
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,950
The classes for English and Math
will be on Saturdays and Sundays.

468
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:31,110
I want you to go over the day's materials
before each class...

469
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:33,180
and help with the homework.

470
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,480
The tutoring sessions will start
at 11 p.m. and last for two hours.

471
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,200
Would that be possible?

472
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,320
Yes.

473
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:48,060
Since it'll be late, I'll pay for
your taxi rides home.

474
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:51,030
There'll be a set regular pay,
but on top of it...

475
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:59,220
there'll be monthly incentives dependant
on the schoolteachers' opinion.

476
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:02,370
Somewhere between 100,000 won
and 150,000 won.

477
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:07,500
It felt so weird.
She was my mom's age, but normal.

478
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,750
A war like atmosphere, no? The competition for
college entrance is just beginning.

479
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:15,810
People like you who are willing to pay
anything for a tutor has created this phenomenon.

480
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:17,880
Giving false hopes to parents.

481
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:22,410
It's not my fault...
But I do feel partially responsible.

482
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:27,990
I think you'll be very uncomfortable.
I don't think you should tutor kids.

483
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,300
She's right.

484
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,380
I'm not going back to the academy.
The bar exam format will be reformed too.

485
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,660
Then what will you do?

486
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:34,880
I guess the marriage comes first.
Then what will you do?

487
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,740
I guess the marriage comes first.

488
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,560
- What?
- With who?

489
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,200
She's right there.

490
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,680
Hello.

491
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,370
How have you been?

492
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:52,190
- We just heard.
- Congratulations.

493
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,100
How embarrassing.

494
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:57,610
There's no need!
Why would you be embarrassed?

495
00:38:57,610 --> 00:39:00,350
We already have a kid!

496
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:02,580
That's a successful life!

497
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,010
Do your colleagues know?

498
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,890
Of course they do.

499
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,310
How about my mom?

500
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,940
We'll tell her soon.

501
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,380
Then...

502
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,440
I'm quitting.

503
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,690
What?

504
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,950
Both of us want to do something else.

505
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,370
That's right.

506
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,390
You don't have to be so formal with me.

507
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,340
What do you want to do?

508
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,590
You're very interested in jobs
these days, aren't you?

509
00:39:30,590 --> 00:39:32,000
I suppose I am...

510
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:38,810
May I ask if the two of you are
going to continue with your studies or not?

511
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,630
Are both of you stopping?
Or are you both continuing?

512
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,200
Or is one going to support
the other?

513
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,150
Tell us once you make the decision.

514
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,530
That'll be 19,000 won.

515
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,820
Please sign here.

516
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,370
- Do you need the receipt?
- Yes.

517
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,240
Thank you!
Goodbye!

518
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,410
So what do you think?

519
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,300
You?

520
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,660
I really want to do it now.

521
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:20,490
I'll pass the exam and walk
a completely different path than my father.

522
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:24,270
I told him the same thing too.

523
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,990
To whom?

524
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,650
Your father came.

525
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:29,900
What?

526
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,970
He stopped by to take a brief look at
Jin Young but I ran into him.

527
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,530
Then I told him straight.

528
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:41,250
I told him that I don't know what he means
when he says he's doing things for Jin Young.

529
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:47,990
That if I could, I'll create a place in which
kids can succeed without rich grandfathers.

530
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:49,990
His way of thinking is indeed different.

531
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:55,490
So he cares for Jin Young,
but still insists on being that 0.1 percent.

532
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:58,880
Isn't that scary?
Shouldn't everyone live together happily?

533
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,950
It'd be great if we can study together, no?

534
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,750
But there's no guarantee.

535
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:10,010
Look, we can barely get 1.4 million won by
working here 6 hours a day, five times a week.

536
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:14,190
And for you, you can only study if
your mom looks after Jin Young!

537
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,600
It's just impossible for
the both of us to study.

538
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,980
We'll have to consider ourselves dead
for a year and a half.

539
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,420
If we have to choose one...

540
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,000
wouldn't you have a better chance than me?

541
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,200
Why?

542
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,450
On that mock test, you got more
difficult questions right.

543
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:32,760
That's an advantage.

544
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,000
That's not a good indication.

545
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,210
Should we decide by rock paper scissors?

546
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,080
That's fair.

547
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,600
We'll reach a conclusion once we put
some more thought into it.

548
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,390
I hope so.

549
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:58,240
<i>I hope that I will be able to extinguish every
single piece of doubt out there about me...</i>

550
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,770
<i>So I promise to answer
with only the truth.</i>

551
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,670
<i>I'd like to talk about this
"Supernova" rumor.</i>

552
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:10,670
<i>I know nothing about it.</i>

553
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:15,600
<i>Those accusations that my brother-in-law
made two billion won with 100 million won...</i>

554
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,020
<i>is groundless.</i>

555
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,130
<i>Do you think that makes sense?</i>

556
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:29,090
<i>What kind of idiot would only invest 100 million
won in a scheme that would twentyfold his money?</i>

557
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,310
They need to turn off the microphone...

558
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:36,940
<i>I'm sorry, I couldn't control my emotions
and said something inappropriate.</i>

559
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,430
<i>If I may say this again...</i>

560
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:42,010
<i>I don't have anything to do with
that rumor.</i>

561
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,780
<i>I've never heard anything about it,
and know nothing about it.</i>

562
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,940
<i>This is a conspiracy against me.</i>

563
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,500
<i>That's not true either.</i>

564
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,660
<i>If I do say so myself...</i>

565
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:58,760
<i>I hate white collar finance criminals
the most.</i>

566
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:58,830
<i>Mr. Kim Jin Seong has been confirmed
as the next prime minister of South Korea.
I hate white collar finance criminals
the most.</i>

567
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:04,280
<i>Mr. Kim Jin Seong has been confirmed
as the next prime minister of South Korea.</i>

568
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,060
<i>The Parliament's vote, which happened
at 3 p.m. today...</i>

569
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:11,240
<i>showed 198 yeas and 80 nays
out of 281 total members.</i>

570
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,590
<i>It seems like 50 out of 130 members
of opposition voted in favor of Mr. Kim.</i>

571
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:20,980
<i>The other party let its members vote based
solely on their personal convictions</i>

572
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,360
<i>and this is the reason why the confirmation
process has ended very smoothly.</i>

573
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:31,500
<i>Now that he's confirmed, the president will
meet with Mr. Kim tonight...</i>

574
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,630
<i>to talk about reshuffling the cabinet.</i>

575
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,010
<i>Mr. Kim start his official duties as
prime minister tomorrow.</i>

576
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:40,450
You must be relieved.

577
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,480
Well done.

578
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:45,940
Let me shake your hand.

579
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:48,670
It's my honor, sir.

580
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:55,270
So I guess the Han Trust won't be
mentioned for a while.

581
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,190
You and your brother will be safe too.

582
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,470
All thanks to you, sir.

583
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:07,990
Go home early and get some rest.

584
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:10,410
Thank you, sir.

585
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:19,430
Well done, ma'am.

586
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:20,850
Congratulations.

587
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,190
That's not necessary.

588
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,770
I was worried that your brother
might become the scapegoat...

589
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:32,330
once the Han family's foreign bank
accounts get revealed.

590
00:44:35,650 --> 00:44:37,020
Indeed.

591
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,920
I gave my everything to this
because I can't let that happen.

592
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,930
You've managed to protect your brother.

593
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,800
Yes, I have.

594
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,660
You must be happy.

595
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,190
Yes.

596
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:53,530
I think it'll be prudent of you to refrain from
showing your happiness in front of Joo Young...

597
00:44:53,530 --> 00:44:56,550
It's fine.
This isn't the end.

598
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,530
Is that so?

599
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,060
There's Yang Jae Hwa, who wants to
safeguard her money.

600
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,970
Then there's Min Joo Young, who
wants to recover her brother's tainted name.

601
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,860
We'll see who might be the stronger one.

602
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:16,170
Don't be like that.
It's scary.

603
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,240
This is why people laugh at us.

604
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:48,570
They did not use any of our questions.

605
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,920
How could everyone be so easy on him?
It was a comedy show!

606
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,550
Yang Jae Hwa did well.

607
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:00,040
She showed the members what she
knows about them.

608
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,750
The times when they frequented
massage parlors and saloons...

609
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:07,590
when they got into fights with people,
their overdue loans...

610
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,390
We can't reveal a corruption case
that's 100 times bigger than those...

611
00:46:10,390 --> 00:46:13,130
because people are afraid that those
petty things will be found out.

612
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,060
Hello.

613
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,120
How's the runaway life?
I guess you can come back now.

614
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:32,730
What?

615
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,470
How are you in Korea?

616
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:41,580
If I tell you how I managed to stay in Korea
and continue to enjoy my Seoul life...

617
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:44,220
would you change your world view a bit?

618
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:50,980
I said one thing to President Han.
That changed the scapegoat.

619
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,300
Do you think I would ever
pledge my alligence to that guy?

620
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,630
I just promised him to fill his
empty forehead.

621
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,850
I introduced him to my doctor
who specializes in hair transplants.

622
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,990
You can't beat him.

623
00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,180
You can't even afford to be his enemy.

624
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:27,880
Selecting the judging panel
might be random...

625
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,420
but everyone defers to him!

626
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:35,810
All the judges want to go to places
like Hansong once their retire!

627
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:42,120
How can you expect them to rule
against corporations then?

628
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,110
Don't waste your time and energy.

629
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:48,570
Let's just blind ourselves
and live happily.

630
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,800
I'm sorry, but I have a happier life.

631
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,720
And your hair joke was very bad.

632
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,460
Song Jae Won?

633
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,080
Yes.

634
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,270
He used to treat criminals very well.

635
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:12,540
It was all possible because he had
those safety nets like that.

636
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,110
How are you friends with him?

637
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:15,320
Figurine collections.

638
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,050
You're quite something.

639
00:48:18,470 --> 00:48:22,090
When I go to his bar, I get to find out
more about the elite class of this country.

640
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:25,140
Everything about President Han's
family too.

641
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,820
So, did President Han get
a date for the surgery?

642
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,670
Of course!

643
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,750
He said he'll do it at the end of this month
and treat it like his summer vacation!

644
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:36,260
How fortunate!

645
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,700
But who's the new scapegoat?

646
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,010
Secretary Yang's brother is the head
of the Han Trust.

647
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,320
Wow!

648
00:48:43,770 --> 00:48:46,670
It seems like it'll pass without
a problem...

649
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:50,630
But it seems like Secretary Yang told
President Han to arrest her own brother...

650
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,410
if things come up to the surface.

651
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:55,550
She's so loyal!

652
00:48:55,550 --> 00:49:00,290
I'm sure he'll be compensated well
if he does a year or two in prison!

653
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:01,980
I bet he wouldn't do any prison time!

654
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,770
This is how it should've been
from the beginning.

655
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:06,940
He didn't have to tell you
to leave the country!

656
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,790
I thought I'd be dead.

657
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:13,630
There's no better place to hang out
than Korea!

658
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:14,850
That's right.

659
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,160
I can't stay at the same place for more than
a month no matter how nice the place is.

660
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,500
So be careful from now on.
Stop startling us!

661
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:24,650
Of course.
Let's call up Yeon Hee.

662
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:28,930
I think you should wait.
I think she's still uncomfortable with me.

663
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,450
Why?
It was the kids' doing.

664
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:33,280
It's not entirely about the kids.

665
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:39,040
Everyone got embarrassed,
but she moreso than I.

666
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:41,950
This might be a good thing.

667
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:46,390
They might become too relaxed by
this new victory.

668
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,670
How could you be so positive?

669
00:49:49,670 --> 00:49:52,920
Our goal is to continue
until the very end.

670
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:56,030
We'll connect the Han Trust and the
presidential election and the foreign accounts.

671
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:58,260
I like the attitude.

672
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:00,660
I'll go.

673
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,300
Probably the paralegal applicant.

674
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:11,130
I'm Park Gyung Tae.
I sent you an email.

675
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,150
For the paralegal opening?

676
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,020
- Yes.
- Come in.

677
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:21,460
Welcome.
I'm Yoon Je Hoon.

678
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,660
This way.

679
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:35,210
It's nice to meet everyone.
But is this the interview right now?

680
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:38,190
In a way, yes.

681
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,790
- Here.
- Thank you.

682
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:48,490
How did you find out about us?

683
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:51,700
I'm sure you know Han In Sang.

684
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,820
I see...

685
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,190
Yes.

686
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,120
His running away from home has given me
an opportunity to switch my career.

687
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,270
So you came here knowing everything.

688
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,840
Yes.

689
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,550
You're Ms. Min Joo Young...

690
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:11,950
Yes...

691
00:51:11,950 --> 00:51:13,840
I'm Seo Bom's uncle.

692
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,380
Nice to see you.

693
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:19,110
We met several days ago
with In Sang.

694
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:21,750
Right.

695
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:50,790
He has a class at ten o'clock today.
Did he have breakfast?

696
00:51:51,090 --> 00:51:54,080
Should I call him and tell him
to go to school?

697
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:58,330
Leave him alone!
He looks so tired.

698
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:02,170
Missing a day won't do anything!

699
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:07,920
Anyway, I'm leaving now.

700
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,180
He might still be asleep
when you come home.

701
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:17,380
I'm telling you in advance
so you don't get startled when you get home.

702
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,190
Okay.

703
00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,570
We've contacted everyone
in this line.

704
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:57,700
Those will be sold soon.

705
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:00,780
How much per household?

706
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,630
I'm thinking 1.5 times higher
than market price.

707
00:53:04,630 --> 00:53:07,200
The new construction is still being
planned out...

708
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,770
But you must sign a contract that binds you
to vacate the unit within a certain timeframe...

709
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:15,390
as soon as you sign the
general sales contract.

710
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:19,100
So when would that be?

711
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,400
I'm not sure.

712
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:28,630
If you'll vacate the place before that,
please give me a call to that number.

713
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,470
I don't think that would happen.

714
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:34,740
I'm not forcing this on you.

715
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:36,990
I'll get going then.

716
00:53:38,030 --> 00:53:39,740
Goodbye.

717
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:49,410
I shouldn't have sold it back then.

718
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:52,470
You had to sell it!
You couldn't even afford the interest.

719
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:58,150
If I had managed to keep the property,
the kids would be living much better lives!

720
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:01,040
It pains me to think about it.

721
00:54:01,630 --> 00:54:03,160
Excuse me...

722
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,650
Why didn't you go to school?

723
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,750
I overslept.
I'm on my way now.

724
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:13,650
A hard worker!

725
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,960
Not that...

726
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,420
How we live has exceeded your
wildest imaginations, hasn't it?

727
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:23,050
We sometimes have very
startling moments too.

728
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:24,140
Why?

729
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,720
I'm curious about that too.

730
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,810
You should study hard and teach me!

731
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,840
I'm just kidding.
You should get going.

732
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:37,700
Yes.

733
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,450
You're up!
Are you okay?

734
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:42,600
Yes, why?

735
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,190
I came because I was worried.

736
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,510
I'll be back.

737
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,700
One of us must make money.

738
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,050
Just go!

739
00:54:55,340 --> 00:54:56,760
Likes attract like.

740
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:01,550
I'm sure it's upsetting for you.
But you must respond logically.

741
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,270
Are you scared?

742
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:08,410
Or do you want me to be scared?

743
00:55:09,770 --> 00:55:14,400
Of course their next steps
are very obvious.

744
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:21,880
They'll have no regard for politeness and just
continue to create noise in every way possible.

745
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,790
But everyone will be sick of that soon.

746
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:31,680
I don't even care about being sick of them.
They're just annoying.

747
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,460
- I'm coming in
- Yes, ma'am.

748
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:36,360
What happened to Mr. Park?

749
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,130
Well...

750
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:41,080
Is In Sang still meeting up with him?

751
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:45,810
If that's the case, I'll really disown him!

752
00:55:47,310 --> 00:55:48,660
Secretary Lee!

753
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:50,460
Yes?

754
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,290
Is Mr. Park seeing the kids?
You must know.

755
00:55:55,290 --> 00:56:00,410
Well...
I don't think this is the appropriate time...

756
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:05,990
[Resignation Letter]

757
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:11,870
What is that?

758
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,640
It is only natural for Secretary Lee
to leave too.

759
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,920
Are they dating?

760
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:28,760
You can only go after I leave.

761
00:56:29,730 --> 00:56:31,190
Where are you going?

762
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,500
Study abroad.

763
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,580
I'll go when she goes.

764
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:41,190
Then the sides will become too obvious.

765
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:42,540
The sides?

766
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,440
<i>Be responsible!</i>

767
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:54,430
We won't stop you.

768
00:56:54,430 --> 00:57:00,630
But you can only leave once you find
your replacement and train her.

769
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,810
- That's how we'll process it.
- Yes, sir.

770
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:24,340
- Everyone...
- Come down from there.

771
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,230
Don't lord over us.

772
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,810
Darling...
This is a betrayal, right?

773
00:57:55,020 --> 00:57:58,630
Subtitles by DramaFever

774
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,180
You ran away from your home
to hinder your wife like this?

775
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:17,000
We must think again to see
if our life goal is really that.

776
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,620
You must come up with a strategy.
No need to look back.

777
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:20,750
Once you have an opportunity...

778
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,250
Will you be okay?

779
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,470
Go with me.
