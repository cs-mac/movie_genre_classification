2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,120
Is it programmable matter?
Technically, sure.

3
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,650
But then, so is a liquid crystal display.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,710
Which was also a breakthrough

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:20,000
and also thought to be as
inconceivable as claytronics.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:21,930
Olivia...

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,180
Your encouragement is much appreciated.

8
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,730
I think I'm gonna grab a coffee.

9
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,710
Yes. Um...of course.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,160
I have a big day tomorrow.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:34,810
Bye.

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,810
Bye.

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,860
Hello?

14
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,180
Hello?

15
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:55,430
Professor Donovan?

16
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,700
Chris!

17
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,440
Chris.

18
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,350
35-year-old male, shallow breath,

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,790
widespread internal hemorrhaging.

20
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:06,200
He hasn't stopped bleeding.

21
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,530
O2 -- 10 liters.

22
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,310
125 of methylprednisolone, I.V. push.

23
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,670
Let's get him on the table.

24
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:13,180
What's his name?

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,890
Dr. Chris Donovan.

26
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,100
What kind of doctor is he?

27
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,290
He works with artificial
intelligence -- robotics.

28
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,620
What's wrong with him?

29
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,520
Oh, God!

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,210
Damn, Jenny. Just plug it.

31
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,260
His blood -- it's moving.

32
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,030
This is a cellphone video taken
by an emergency-room technician

33
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,500
at a hospital in Pittsburgh last night.

34
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,920
- What am I looking at? - Nanites.

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,740
Highly advanced robotics
on a microscopic scale.

36
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,940
Nanite technology has
not advanced this far.

37
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:49,420
This is a -- a scientific impossibility.

38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,620
So is a microchip in the brain.

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,100
They somehow got into
this man's bloodstream

40
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,880
causing massive internal bleeding.

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,800
And who's the victim?

42
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,010
Dr. Chris Donovan,

43
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,580
one of the nation's premier experts on...

44
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,240
Artificial intelligence.

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,380
I knew Chris.

46
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,840
Shen, I'm so sorry.

47
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,930
It gets worse, unfortunately.

48
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,500
Dr. Ezby Grant of Portland, Oregon,

49
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,940
Dr. Horatio Cameron of Dallas, Texas --

50
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,320
both dead in the past 24 hours.

51
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,340
There are two more in
Europe and South America

52
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,510
that seem to match --

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,580
Elian Vega and Susanna Delacroix.

54
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,740
Delacroix?

55
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:35,580
Scientists working with
bio-inspired robotics

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,070
is a really... small circle.

57
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,860
They're not just scientists, son.

58
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,850
They're giants.

59
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,940
Their loss is incalculable.

60
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,370
Is the CDC involved?

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,360
No, nanites are not a contagion.

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,820
What we are dealing with
are intelligent machines

63
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,840
programmed to kill.

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,420
Okay, look, the first thing we need to do

65
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,210
is find out how the nanites
are being distributed, right?

66
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,370
We need to trace them to
their original source.

67
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,400
Until that happens, we should isolate

68
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,260
any of the doctors, the E.R. staffs --

69
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,410
anyone who has been in potential
contact with these victims.

70
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:03,690
I'll institute a full quarantine.

71
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,930
You said the scientists
work in small circles.

72
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:08,570
Any chance they traveled
to the same location?

73
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,260
Maybe a conference or something?

74
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,380
Accessing passports and e-mails.

75
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,140
No conferences, but I'm
looking through crime photos,

76
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,470
and I did find a link.

77
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,850
They each received identical packages --

78
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,700
Small yellow boxes, minimum postage,

79
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,180
which means they're nearly weightless.

80
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,220
Chris had an open one in his office.

81
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,200
No return address, I'm assuming.

82
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,150
No.

83
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,700
Without being able to I.D. the sender,

84
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:36,100
it's impossible to know how many
more packages are in transit.

85
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,600
We should send a team out to the
doc's house, check his mail.

86
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,500
My mail?

87
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:40,530
Gabriel's right.

88
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,300
If they're targeting giants in the field,

89
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,950
you're certain to be on that list.

90
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,550
Which is why you're not
leaving this facility

91
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,960
until we find who's responsible

92
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,970
for slaughtering the great
scientists of our time.

93
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,030
Gabriel Vaughn

94
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,890
One of our nation's most
decorated soldiers.

95
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,740
He's a hero, and now our
country's most secret weapon.

96
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,730
Gabriel possesses a rare genetic mutation

97
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,470
that allowed us to implant
a microchip in his brain.

98
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,360
We connected his mind directly
to the information grid.

99
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,420
It's something the chip
does that nobody expected.

100
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,740
I can create a virtual snapshot
of an event in my mind

101
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,710
and then walk through it.

102
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,160
It's like a virtual evidence wall.

103
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,670
At U.S. Cyber command,

104
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,750
we created a highly specialized
unit around him...

105
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,880
Satellite in five.

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,220
...and assigned an agent to protect him.

107
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,010
Gun!

108
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,170
He's the first of his kind --

109
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,470
the next evolution of intelligence.

110
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,910
Are we crowding you?

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,230
You just tell us if we're crowding you.

112
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,080
I could do with a tad less heavy breathing.

113
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,740
Thank you.

114
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,100
Guys, stop breathing.

115
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,560
They look like...bugs.

116
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,920
More like a monster-truck rally.

117
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,920
I would love to browse the patent
portfolio behind all this.

118
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,910
You really think whoever
designed these nanites

119
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:21,030
applied for a patent?

120
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,250
If they didn't, they should have.

121
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,290
It'd be worth a fortune.

122
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,370
Why does every advancement in technology

123
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,740
end up being used in anger or for violence?

124
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,640
I don't mean you, obviously.

125
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,830
If the chip fits...

126
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,000
I searched the list of potential
targets you gave me, Nelson,

127
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,880
including your father,

128
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,900
and I put all the local
post offices on alert.

129
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,820
But...?

130
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,610
One box managed to slip through.

131
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,580
Who's the recipient?

132
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,060
Bryce Tyler.

133
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,840
Bryce?

134
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,530
Oh, god.

135
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,220
He was one of my dad's PROTéGéS.

136
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,170
He wrote the book "Warp Evolution"

137
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,760
about the merge of man and machine,

138
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,220
transhumanism, the singularity.

139
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,680
He was the most ambitious
student I ever had.

140
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,800
Please, you have got to reach him.

141
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,210
Don't worry, doc. We'll get to it.

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,020
Nobody's answering the
phone in Bryce's office,

143
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,380
and he's still not picking
up his cellphone.

144
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,920
It's still early. He might not be in yet.

145
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,520
He's got his cellphone on "Silent."

146
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,350
I'm changing the setting.

147
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,900
Making the call now.

148
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,230
Yes?

149
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,330
Bryce Tyler?

150
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,990
My name is Gabriel Vaughn.

151
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,930
I'm a friend of Shenandoah Cassidy's,

152
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,590
and I work at U.S. Cyber Command.

153
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,140
I need you to listen carefully.

154
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,950
Cyber Command? What's this about?

155
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,730
I'll explain more when we get there.

156
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,730
There's been a credible
threat to your life.

157
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,370
Do not open any packages that come to you.

158
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,380
Oh, no.

159
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,510
My assistant.

160
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,950
Hello? Dr. Tyler?

161
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,130
Mr. Tyler? Why are you calling my cell?

162
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,740
Audrie, do not open any
package addressed to me.

163
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:53,500
Understand?

164
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,620
Why not?

165
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,620
Just put them on.

166
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,370
We still don't know how
the nanites are spread.

167
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,670
No.

168
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,770
Wait.

169
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,670
She's dead.

170
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,890
Nanites are meant to cure world hunger,

171
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,930
attack cancer, create fuel.

172
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,880
But this is...

173
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,910
Someone with a different idea.

174
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:36,610
Which is why we need to
concentrate our efforts, Bryce.

175
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,640
to stop them.

176
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,670
Okay? That's why you're here.

177
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,320
Now, come on.

178
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,440
Now, the nanites were delivered in the box

179
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,610
in the form of a dust.

180
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,590
Open the box, and the dust is released.

181
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,270
- So they're airborne. - Right.

182
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,610
But since we don't have a long list

183
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,240
of dead doctors, nurses, or mailmen,

184
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,630
we're assuming the nanites
were programmed somehow

185
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,780
to only attack their targets.

186
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,940
But we haven't caught one alive
long enough to study it.

187
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,180
How can they be alive?

188
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,390
Well, obviously, they're
not completely organic.

189
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,790
They seem to enjoy a capacity for growth.

190
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,950
Apparently, they have a purpose.

191
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,210
Combine that with the
element of intelligence,

192
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,420
artificial or not,

193
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,210
and I defy you to tell me the distinction

194
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:13,040
between a living organism and
these remarkable creatures.

195
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,180
Tell us what you see.

196
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,550
It's more your area than it is mine.

197
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,550
Uh, encapsulated in polymer,

198
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:18,780
CMOS front end,

199
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,580
piezo core.

200
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,740
But this particle size is leaps beyond

201
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,300
anything we're doing in my company.

202
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,060
Whoever did this knows their business.

203
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,460
Huh. Wait till you see the note.

204
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,530
It's a simple binary code.

205
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,720
Has anybody translated it?

206
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,570
"Welcome to the future."

207
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,700
Whoever had the ability to do this

208
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,000
knows how to hide himself.

209
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,050
Whoever had the ability to do
this does not want to hide.

210
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:45,830
What do you mean?

211
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:47,520
Someone with a mind this twisted

212
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,060
doesn't want to be in the shadows for long.

213
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,300
They want to be famous.

214
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,690
They want us to know why.

215
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,850
Yes, of course.

216
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,600
Can I use your electron microscope?

217
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,180
Sure. Why?

218
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,650
We're not thinking small enough.

219
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,690
This is the letter the killer left us.

220
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,170
On the surface, it's binary code,

221
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,990
A Series of 1s and 0s, a
single hidden message,

222
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,190
"Welcome to the future" --

223
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,080
At least, that's what we thought.

224
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,030
Right -- now check out what we see

225
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,470
when it's magnified by 200 nanometers.

226
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,240
There's text embedded inside
each typewritten number.

227
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,830
This is a manifesto.

228
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:27,830
Yeah. We see a lot of these
loon letters at Secret Service.

229
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,450
Angry guy with a lot to say.

230
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,970
"A lot" is right. How
about 300 pages of text?

231
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,870
I want to see the whole document.
Can you extract it?

232
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:34,500
Yeah.

233
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,870
What are you doing?

234
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:47,340
Reading.

235
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:50,280
35,000 words?

236
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,570
I'm skimming.

237
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,650
Look at the phraseology.
There should be a pattern.

238
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,740
Then locate document

239
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,370
where certain word groupings
have been used before.

240
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:59,720
Nelson, can you run a program
like that or something?

241
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Uh...I-I -- yes.

242
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,890
I can...do that... here.

243
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:15,540
"Evolution is earth's deepest breath.

244
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,470
Technolution, its dying gasp."

245
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:18,640
Poetic.

246
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:20,240
He's repeated it on at least

247
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,780
six anti-government, anti-education,
and conspiracy websites.

248
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,080
There are other matches, too.

249
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,840
Do you have a name?

250
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,540
User name belongs to a Gordon Greyson.

251
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,860
Gordon Greyson?

252
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:31,780
Oh, yeah. This guy's the real deal.

253
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,370
NSA watchlist, tSA no-fly.

254
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,930
He's corresponded with at least
four of the five victims.

255
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,570
How could you know that?

256
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,130
Well, 'cause he's looking at my screen.

257
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:42,340
I have all the e-mails pulled up.

258
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:44,480
Do we have an address?

259
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:46,900
Uh...no. This guy's careful.

260
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,730
He's I.P. ghosting all over the place.

261
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,370
I got him.

262
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,060
He's in an industrial area in Baltimore.

263
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,930
What is he?

264
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,500
Excuse me?

265
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:02,930
You...

266
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,200
You finally did it, didn't you?

267
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,050
Did what?

268
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,950
You overcame your fear
of what might happen --

269
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,130
or you were convinced.

270
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:13,590
Dr. Cassidy, would you please
escort Dr. Tyler out of here?

271
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,810
How much of him is organic -- human?

272
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:18,030
Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm all human.

273
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:20,330
No, you're not -- not all human.

274
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:23,340
Dr. Cassidy.

275
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,410
Bryce, please come with me.

276
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,460
Embrace what you are.

277
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,340
Bryce, that's enough.

278
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,400
And what am I?

279
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,270
The future.

280
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,920
Don't tell me you let that
guy get under your skin.

281
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,500
It's not skin. It's more
like...leatherette.

282
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,990
I refuse to accept that
leatherette is the future.

283
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,580
You watched the title fight on
pay-per-view saturday night.

284
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,610
And in the morning, you had
a soy latte after your run.

285
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,290
How do you know it was
after and not before?

286
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,490
'cause you checked your e-mail at 6:00 A.M.
from your apartment

287
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,390
and again an hour later from your phone

288
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,840
on the other side of Rock Creek Park.

289
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,520
I'm just saying it'd be nice
to come in monday morning

290
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,490
and not already know what
you did all weekend.

291
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,480
You knew I had a soy latte
because you know me.

292
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,740
It's not the chip.

293
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,090
This is the place.

294
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,350
I don't like this without a full tac team.

295
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:47,300
If we're ever gonna find out

296
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,030
what other packages are already out there,

297
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,440
we need this guy alive.

298
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,990
Sometimes tac teams aren't so good at that.

299
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,370
Neither are you.

300
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,790
Greyson last accessed the
Internet from here this morning.

301
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,710
The building's lined with wire mesh.

302
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,810
I can't chip any of the systems
inside -- at least not clearly.

303
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,480
So he could have eyes on
us and we can't see him?

304
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,770
Great.

305
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,910
Any ideas on a way in?

306
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,560
That ladder activates in case of a fire.

307
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,040
Camera.

308
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,240
Can you chip it?

309
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,550
No. It's heavily encrypted.

310
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,600
Guess we're gonna have to
do this like normal people.

311
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,430
Move.

312
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,710
Gabriel.

313
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,940
Check the handwriting.

314
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,500
Is this our guy?

315
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,660
Matches the manifesto.

316
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,790
He's our guy.

317
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,940
Greyson!

318
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,730
Stop right there!

319
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,560
Put the gun down now.

320
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:52,850
Now turn around slowly.

321
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,200
If you're really gonna take me in,

322
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,500
I'd at least like to know who you are.

323
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,540
U.S. Cyber command.

324
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,790
I would have thought CIA or FBI.

325
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,730
But that actually makes more sense.

326
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,280
Meet and greet's over.
Now get on the ground.

327
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:14,620
Why? So you can put me
in some deep, dark hole?

328
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,960
Exactly.

329
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
That would be a little redundant.

330
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,370
What are you talking about?

331
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,100
Oh, I have a hole of my own.

332
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,050
No.

333
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,150
It's booby-trapped.

334
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,960
He just activated some kind of I.E.D.

335
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,660
I'm pulling up diagrams of the warehouse

336
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,650
and the city's underground
railroad tunnels.

337
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,450
As in the underground railroad?

338
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,490
This place was built on the site
of an original slave market.

339
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,080
Looks like the tunnels lead
into the city's sewage system

340
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,190
about 200 yards from here.

341
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,630
- Turn here. - You sure?

342
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,790
That tunnel back at the
warehouse leads to two others.

343
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,330
I think one of them's filled with water.

344
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:12,720
This will be his only way out.

345
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,690
There.

346
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,490
This area's wide open. He
couldn't have got far on foot.

347
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,430
He had a vehicle waiting.

348
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,300
Tire tracks lead that way.
He's got a head start on us.

349
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,320
He was definitely prepared.
I'll give him that.

350
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,130
I'm in the treadmaster national database.

351
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,020
It's a pickup, late model, bias ply,

352
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,710
O-8 tires, probably American.

353
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,800
Wheelbase is pretty narrow.
I'd say it's a Ford.

354
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,090
My little brother's a gearhead.

355
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,650
Let's go.

356
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,640
I'm in the DMV database

357
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,310
checking late-model Ford
pickups in Baltimore.

358
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:56,360
Nothing registered to the
name Gordon Greyson.

359
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,400
I'm looking at known aliases right now.
There's nothing.

360
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:00,950
This guy's doing everything
to stay off the grid.

361
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,630
There's no way he's gonna
fill out a credit report

362
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,370
to buy a car.

363
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:04,270
He'd pay cash.

364
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,330
Check with the I.R.S.

365
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,780
Cross-reference with local dealers.

366
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,630
What am I looking for?

367
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,020
Form 83-100s filed in connection

368
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,250
with the purchase of a Ford
pickup in the last 10 years.

369
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,450
Right -- dealer would be required

370
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:16,120
to file an 83-100 with internal revenue.

371
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,330
It's a money-laundering thing.

372
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,320
Got it.

373
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,560
2005 Ford F-150

374
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,400
registered in his mother's maiden name.

375
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,300
Jameson, we need eyes on that truck.

376
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:29,210
I got D.C. sat coverage moving
into position any second.

377
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,900
Checking a 2-mile radius from the tunnel.

378
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:33,280
Hold on.

379
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,130
Found a match. All right, do you see it?

380
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,620
It's on the move-- heading northwest.

381
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,190
I'm gonna chip the traffic
lights just ahead of him.

382
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,290
Greyson! Don't move!

383
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:10,490
You people think you can
shut me up, but you can't.

384
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,700
Don't worry.

385
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,790
I'll let you talk all you want.

386
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:20,150
Can you tell me exactly what my crime is?

387
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
You're a terrorist.

388
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,660
A terrorist?

389
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,870
A term as lazy as it is overused.

390
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,830
"The architects of human
extinction must be struck down"

391
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,660
You are taking my words out of context.

392
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,770
I've never advocated violence-- never.

393
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,630
Funny, coming from a guy

394
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,090
that just shot at federal agents.

395
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,800
You-- you were trespassing.

396
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,630
The Second Amendment affords me
the right to shoot and kill--

397
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:40,540
I'm sorry-- is it the right

398
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,890
to program nanites to kill
scientists you don't like?

399
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,620
Nanites?

400
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,180
Where are the other packages?
Who else did you send them to?

401
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,770
I don't send packages.

402
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:49,840
I send letters--

403
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,350
Warnings about the
consequences of their work.

404
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,460
Like this?

405
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,560
"Dormitories of mediocre minds

406
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,480
filled with insidious
promises and empty lies."

407
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,060
So, that's the great Gordon Greyson.

408
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:06,860
Incredible.

409
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,240
He was working with nano-technology

410
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,610
when it was in its infancy.

411
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,900
You two talk as though he's to be admired.

412
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,980
Once upon a time, Lillian, that
man inspired a generation.

413
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,040
- Right? - Yeah. Till he got scared.

414
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,310
What do you mean, scared?

415
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:21,030
Greyson claimed he'd developed an algorithm

416
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,170
which could conceivably

417
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,640
make artificial intelligence autonomous.

418
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,700
Now, in all our simulations
of the human mind,

419
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,500
what limits us is the ability of
the computer to program itself.

420
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,780
So if that were possible,
so the theory goes,

421
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,650
we-- meaning people--

422
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,920
Well, we suddenly become unnecessary.

423
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,710
It's called transhumanism--

424
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:41,430
The biological synthesis
between man and technology.

425
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,570
And it's nothing to be afraid of.

426
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,660
Your...creation is certainly proof of that.

427
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,460
Gabriel is not what you think he is.

428
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,720
And he's certainly not my "creation."

429
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:56,050
If you say so.

430
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,300
These scientists, these
people that you killed,

431
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,160
they had families.

432
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,570
They were mothers and they were fathers.

433
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:11,060
Look, if-- if-- if nanites did this,

434
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,050
they are creating their own end.

435
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,360
You're blaming them?

436
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,480
I-I-I--

437
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:19,730
I-I want you to imagine a
machine devoid of humanity,

438
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,900
able to learn on its
own, create on its own.

439
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,600
But how do you control it?

440
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,770
How do you reason with it

441
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:28,680
when it's thinking in ways
that we can't even comprehend?

442
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,000
I blame them -- I blame them

443
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,330
for their insatiable hunger for technology.

444
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:33,500
I blame the government.

445
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,820
The people that you work for --

446
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,200
They are the real terrorists.

447
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,750
You realize you're nuts, right?

448
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,170
No, the government --

449
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,720
The government is trying to plant chips

450
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,710
into our minds, into our heads.

451
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,580
It's true even if you don't believe it.

452
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:49,040
It's true.

453
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,320
I swear it --

454
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:52,890
Trust me when I tell you this.

455
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:56,230
Frankenstein's monster will walk among us.

456
00:21:56,230 --> 00:22:00,780
And when he does, the world will be no more
ready for him now than they were then.

457
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:04,860
And this, this, this, and
this is proof of it.

458
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,710
We're not getting anywhere.

459
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,990
What the hell is he doing?

460
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:17,590
Did he just turn the cameras off?

461
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,490
Come on.

462
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,960
What did you just do?

463
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,450
Meet Frankenstein.

464
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,730
What?

465
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,780
What are you talking about?

466
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,400
There's a little red barn in
Alton, Kansas, with two silos.

467
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,070
You use it as your dead drop
ever since you went awol.

468
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,350
And your I.P. address that
ghosts your anonymity

469
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:47,840
is pinging off a serbian server right now.

470
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,200
But you never send any e-mails, do you?

471
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,470
You just read the ones
from your sister, Emma --

472
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,740
the same ones over and over again

473
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,640
so you don't feel so alone.

474
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:01,130
Everything you predicted in
your little manifesto here

475
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,840
is standing right in front of you.

476
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,250
No. I don't believe you.

477
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,560
"There will come a point in which
there will be so much data,

478
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,920
man will need to augment the
human mind just to process it."

479
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,840
The singularity.

480
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:16,830
You?

481
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,730
No. It's not possible.

482
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,740
You're gonna tell us where the
rest of those packages are

483
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,600
in the next 30 seconds...

484
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:29,340
or everything you've ever been
afraid of is about to happen.

485
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:30,700
I don't know.

486
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,480
I swear to you. I don't know.

487
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,050
Gabriel?

488
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,600
Oh, god! - No. No. No.

489
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,300
I'm bleeding!

490
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,690
- What's happening to him? - I don't know.

491
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,310
Hang on.

492
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:07,030
What happened in that room when
you turned off the camera?

493
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:08,910
Nothing. I was just trying to
freak him out a little bit --

494
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:09,800
Shake something loose.

495
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,570
You shook something loose, all right.

496
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,860
Hey. I didn't make him go
all Niagara like that.

497
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,810
Gabriel, there is a reason

498
00:24:14,810 --> 00:24:16,380
that we have surveillance in that room.

499
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:17,290
You're not so special

500
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,660
that you can disregard
standards and protocols.

501
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,700
Standards?

502
00:24:20,910 --> 00:24:21,760
I just watched a guy implode

503
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,850
because microscopic robots ate his flesh.

504
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,410
That's not standard. That's a freak show.

505
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:29,070
Consider yourself lucky.
You have your own freak.

506
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,910
Yes, I feel very lucky.

507
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,430
What?

508
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,720
I don't like you calling yourself a freak.

509
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,730
The youngest one's always a freak.

510
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:51,900
I was the only one my mother
forbid from joining the army.

511
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,860
Well, if she could see you now.

512
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,450
She'd probably have another breakdown.

513
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,680
I'll be lucky if I don't have a breakdown.

514
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,520
Probably millions of them
on this gauze alone.

515
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,930
Just think -- I could
have gone my whole life

516
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:12,270
without seeing something this...disturbing.

517
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,830
Thank you for this, dad.

518
00:25:13,830 --> 00:25:15,120
Yeah, I knew you wouldn't
want to miss a chance

519
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,870
to study the nanites up close.

520
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,250
I was employing sarcasm.

521
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,610
Never mind.

522
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,560
Oh, what the...?

523
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:26,480
Electron magnet.

524
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,160
We're gonna pull the little
bastards out of his arm.

525
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,360
Just think -- Greyson develops
one of the most elegant,

526
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,260
undetectable microscopic
weapons of the century

527
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,800
and then dies of his own creation

528
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,870
the moment we catch him.

529
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,900
Well, that would be poetic,
except now he can't tell us

530
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,280
what the rest of his plan was, now, can he?

531
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:47,740
True.

532
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:51,140
Would you like to take the
sample from his nasal cavity?

533
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,860
Oh, that sounds...awesome,
but I am gonna pass.

534
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,540
Dad, why are we wearing these suits

535
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,130
if the nanites are dead?

536
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,680
The ones in his body are dead.

537
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,070
Are you saying there are others?

538
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,770
Well, he must have been
infected at some point.

539
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,140
It stands to reason he
was carrying them around

540
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,910
on his person somewhere.

541
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,040
Or he was infected before he came in here.

542
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,800
No, because in the other cases,
the victim died quickly.

543
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,900
Greyson was here for, uh -- whew --

544
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,530
about three hours before --

545
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,770
Before...

546
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,640
Oh, hell. You're right.

547
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,270
I am?

548
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:24,750
He wasn't infected here.

549
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,420
Well, then how could he poss--

550
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,650
No, we're thinking about this all wrong.

551
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:29,310
We're treating this like it
is an organic infection.

552
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,440
What we are dealing with
is a mechanical infection.

553
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:36,180
Viruses and bacteria are active
before they enter the body.

554
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:39,380
But a machine can be turned on at any time.

555
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:40,710
All right, good. Let's get out of here.

556
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:41,860
This is...

557
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,080
That's disgusting.

558
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:47,740
He was capable of it.

559
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,060
He was brilliant. He was crazy.

560
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,080
What if he isn't guilty?

561
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,460
What if Gordon is just a
patsy for somebody else?

562
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,230
Go on.

563
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,770
The nanites that killed
Greyson, they could have been

564
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,620
in his system for hours, days, even weeks.

565
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,650
The only reason he died when he did

566
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:03,070
is because at that exact moment,
someone else activated them.

567
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,070
Remotely.

568
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,490
Activated? How?

569
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,530
They're digital creatures.

570
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,740
They can communicate with each other,

571
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,090
And they can be made to communicate

572
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:12,540
with whatever controls them.

573
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,700
I never picked up a signal.

574
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,030
You also can't hear a dog whistle.

575
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,920
The signal the nanites are receiving

576
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,430
would be on a very special spectrum.

577
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,220
Your chip wasn't programmed to access it.

578
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,600
How was the signal sent?

579
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,340
It's called an S.A.R. signal,

580
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,900
And you could piggyback
it on a cell signal.

581
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,160
The nanites take phone calls?

582
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,140
The call would have to be
cellphone to cellphone,

583
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:34,150
But the nanites, they just
have to be in the vicinity...

584
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,420
...to be triggered.

585
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:38,290
My cellphone buzzed
during the interrogation.

586
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,310
It was a blocked number.

587
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,400
Yes, yes. That must have been
when the nanites were activated.

588
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,900
But no cellphone from the outside
can penetrate our shielding.

589
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,480
Maybe he wasn't outside.

590
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:56,770
Are you kidding me?

591
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,490
You son of a bitch.

592
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,890
We gave him complete
access to this building.

593
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:03,060
No. I gave him access.

594
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,920
Come on. Let's go.

595
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:13,060
Bryce selected Greyson because
he matched the profile

596
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,110
of what we'd be looking for --

597
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,640
Anti-government paranoia,
a history of violence.

598
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,950
He planted Greyson's manifesto

599
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:19,770
under each letter to seal the deal.

600
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,790
This man sent a package to his own office,

601
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,360
killed an innocent girl to throw us off.

602
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,300
So be cautious.

603
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,470
There's no telling what he's capable of.

604
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,560
It's over, Bryce.

605
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,770
Your phone.

606
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,780
I don't understand.

607
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,820
No more games. Where's your phone?

608
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,250
Why do you need my phone?

609
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:47,120
This phone has never accessed the deep net.

610
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,010
He used a burner phone.

611
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,090
Where is it?

612
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,580
Dad, your phone's ringing.

613
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,700
What?

614
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,410
Not my phone.

615
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,450
How did this happen?

616
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,070
Bryce infected my dad with nanites.

617
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,150
Then he planted a cellphone
in the lab to activate them.

618
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,060
You got this?

619
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:34,750
Are you in pain, Shen?

620
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,630
Yep.

621
00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:42,040
Okay, this electron magnet
should slow down the nanites.

622
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:42,670
Possibly.

623
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:45,720
Probably! Just...probably.

624
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,110
- Okay, you ready, dad? - Yeah.

625
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,140
Turn it on.

626
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,840
It appears to be working.

627
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,110
Nice job, Nelson.

628
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,700
Now, this will only delay them.

629
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,300
These nanites, they're smart.
They'll adapt.

630
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:08,010
Once they adapt, they'll pick up speed

631
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:10,130
- and get right back to...
- Killing me, yeah.

632
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,410
This is merely slowing
down the death process.

633
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,180
Well...at least I won't
be the first scientist

634
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:20,010
to be ironically felled by science, huh?

635
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,110
Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning

636
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:23,800
shortly after discovering radium.

637
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,670
Dad!

638
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,320
Lighten up, Nelson.

639
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:30,440
You love a good joke when you're nervous.

640
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,660
Well, you need better material.

641
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,190
Someday you'll have a child of your own.

642
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,260
You'll see what it feels like to be as...

643
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,940
as proud as I am.

644
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,770
I just wish I could have met him.

645
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,830
Or -- or her.

646
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:55,430
Okay, look, I like the jokes.

647
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,120
Let's just get back to the jokes.

648
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,380
Gabriel?

649
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,680
I'm here, Doc.

650
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,400
I cannot imagine what I
will be missing with you,

651
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,930
what you'll become.

652
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,040
You can cut that out right now, Doc.

653
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,590
The Cassidy I know doesn't give up.

654
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:19,540
Look at me.

655
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:21,410
This is not goodbye.

656
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:26,950
Just know that I could not have
chosen a better candidate...

657
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,810
a better man.

658
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:36,950
He's bleeding!

659
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:38,900
There's got to be some
way we can treat him!

660
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,990
This is not a disease, okay?

661
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,730
He's being attacked by microscopic A.I.

662
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,740
He doesn't need a doctor! He needs me!

663
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:47,040
He needs you!

664
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:51,390
Bryce is in holding.

665
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,440
I'm gonna make him fix this.

666
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,270
Hang on.

667
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,440
How do we deactivate the nanites?

668
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,750
Tell me -- what do you
see when you look at me?

669
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,250
Data streams?

670
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,690
Just a murderer.

671
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,440
Tell us how to stop the nanites,

672
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,020
and we'll see to it that
you're tried in Maryland,

673
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
where there's no death penalty.

674
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,300
You know, any futurist will tell you

675
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,950
that the world doesn't advance
by a cacophony of voices

676
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:23,960
but evolves only through a singular vision.

677
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,570
One man -- Henry Ford,

678
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,220
Steve Jobs, Bill Gates.

679
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,470
Bin Laden.

680
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,980
This isn't about a vision of the future.

681
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,630
It's about a vision of your bank account.

682
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,340
You're eliminating competition.

683
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,640
Are you just guessing that?

684
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:37,960
Or is that your chip telling you?

685
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,020
It must be difficult for
you to reconcile the two.

686
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,500
Not really.

687
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:46,770
They're both telling me to
kick your ass right now.

688
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,100
You're quite a curiosity.

689
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,110
You are so average,

690
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,760
But your augmented mind is extraordinary.

691
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,850
We're not even the same species.

692
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,210
No, you're not.

693
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,140
Gabriel is warm-blooded.

694
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,020
Warm-blooded.

695
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,710
We got to get up to the lab.

696
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,640
I think I know what to do.

697
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,380
That's your plan -- to kill my dad?

698
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:14,050
The nanites just have to think he's dead.

699
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,280
You said they can only live outside
the body for a few minutes,

700
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,080
which is why you couldn't catch them alive.

701
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,390
That has to be temperature.

702
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,030
Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

703
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,790
When one dies, they all die.
It's called swarm intelligence.

704
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,700
So we lower his body temperature
to simulate a clinical death.

705
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,560
Make the nanites think their job is done.

706
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:37,750
You okay, doc?

707
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,890
- He could really die from this. - I know.

708
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,310
His temperature dropped to 93 degrees.

709
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,490
Okay, he's gonna need a
fast active-core rewarm.

710
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,960
On my signal, you pump him with this.

711
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:46,810
How are we gonna know they're dead

712
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:48,950
if Gabriel can't access the S.A.R. signal?

713
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,650
- Electron magnet. - What about it?

714
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:52,360
It's hooked up to the computer,
which means you can chip it.

715
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,340
Okay, use it for imaging, like an MRI.

716
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,150
Hurry, Gabriel. His body's shutting down.

717
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:57,720
At what point does he enter hypothermia?

718
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,990
We're past that already.

719
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:10,090
I can see them.

720
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:11,660
They're still alive.

721
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:15,100
- Nelson. - Dad?

722
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,870
Dad. He's shutting down. Gabriel!

723
00:34:18,910 --> 00:34:20,560
Not yet. They're slowing.

724
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:21,930
Do you want me to give him the adrenaline?

725
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,070
No! No. I'll -- I'll do it.

726
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,030
Just -- just hold him down.
He's gonna seize.

727
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,760
Now?

728
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:28,780
Not yet.

729
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,210
We're gonna lose him.

730
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,420
Wait.

731
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,770
Now, Nelson! Give him the shot now!

732
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,470
Go, go, go!

733
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,290
Come on, dad! Come on!

734
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,820
Come on, dad! Come on!

735
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:50,400
Come on!

736
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,440
Don't give up on us, doc!

737
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,270
Come on.

738
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,330
Okay.

739
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,970
Glad to see you're okay, old friend.

740
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,430
Are you?

741
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,800
I'm not the one you want.

742
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:59,480
You made a call to your assistant
right before she died.

743
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:04,200
I was trying to...warn her
not to open the package.

744
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:07,520
Oddly, you called her
cellphone, not the office line.

745
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:11,150
So what?

746
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,020
Well, we examined the phone.

747
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,820
When you dial a specific sequence
of numbers before the call,

748
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,460
it sends the required S.A.R. signal --

749
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,420
the one that triggers the nanites.

750
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:22,910
You're wrong.

751
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,310
Well, we're gonna find out.

752
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,280
The post office found another box.

753
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:36,550
A-a-are you crazy?

754
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,710
These nanites can kill you, too.

755
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:42,510
You programmed them

756
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,920
to make one lethal attack,

757
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,000
like a bee with one stinger.

758
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,060
Let's see who will get stung.

759
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,210
So...

760
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:53,010
go ahead, Bryce.

761
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,320
Breathe it in.

762
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:03,860
And now, that sequence was...

763
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,650
7...
7...

764
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,040
4...
4...

765
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,210
7...
7...

766
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:16,900
7...
7...

767
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:19,640
4...
4...

768
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,900
Don't!

769
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,640
Don't.

770
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Powdered sugar.

771
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,470
You were one of my
favorite students, Bryce.

772
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,170
But you were never the brightest,

773
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:55,140
and you were certainly never a visionary.

774
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,950
I guess that's why you had to murder

775
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,480
all of your competition
in order to succeed.

776
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:23,810
Yes?

777
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,630
Uh, we're way past our nightly check-in.

778
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,750
The sun is almost coming up.

779
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:31,360
Did you want to... borrow a cup of sugar?

780
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,910
Maybe.

781
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,380
Well, actually, I was just...

782
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,080
calling to say thank you.

783
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,370
What for?

784
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,170
You know what for.

785
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,990
You know, Lillian told me once that...

786
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,840
we were defined by the decisions we make.

787
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,620
Robots don't make decisions.

788
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,150
They execute code.

789
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:05,160
You make decisions, Gabriel.

790
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,250
And, from where I sit...

791
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,720
they're pretty good ones.

792
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,710
Okay, well...

793
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,050
I have a decision for you to make.

794
00:39:19,650 --> 00:39:20,540
Shoot.

795
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,990
Paco's for bacon and waffles.

796
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,640
I need sleep.

797
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:33,420
And sleep would make sense if you're 90.

798
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,630
Come on.

799
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:37,850
Downstairs in 10.

800
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:39,990
Five.
