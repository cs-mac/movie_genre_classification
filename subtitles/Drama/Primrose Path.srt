"Doctor," Lehman 

11 
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:09,280 
These figures can not be 
To be true 

12 
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,552 
I hope this 

13 
00:03:10,911 --> 00:03:13,101 
Do not see 
Calculations assume 

14 
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:15,225 
We have to make sure it is correct 

15 
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:16,943 
I will say a small sell 

16 
00:03:17,552 --> 00:03:19,395 
And direction 
This means it is heading 

17 
00:03:19,413 --> 00:03:24,697 
Us 
And is fatal to the planets 

18 
00:03:24,697 --> 00:03:25,977 
This is impossible 

19 
00:03:26,226 --> 00:03:31,007 
Have been achieved from the database 
And is not something one finds a large 

20 
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:34,664 
But hit something 
Something big out of orbit 

21 
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:37,759 
I'm sure it 
"Cassandra"

00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:40,382 
"Cassandra" 

23 
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:41,974

Such as the dinosaurs -- 
Yes -- 

28 
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:59,977 
What is ridiculous in this -- 
He said a large "Apollo" by Belan "Cassandra" to become a killer -- 

29 
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,009 
So what do we do? 

30 
00:04:03,634 --> 00:04:07,821 
Follow up and study and find 
Rate approaching 

31 
00:04:07,821 --> 00:04:12,384 
"We send the coordinates to the" de. Me. The

To solve this crisis, which we address today 

139 
00:13:41,122 --> 00:13:44,905 
There is simply a large asteroid 
Moving us 

140

Hai

Nick Chadoin - from Lalji. Me. The -- 
Hague -- 

142 
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:51,739 
Welcome to the world of missile 

143 
00:13:52,157 --> 00:13:56,498 
We in the last 6 hours 
A hail of meteorites on the west coast 

144 
00:13:56,716 --> 00:13:59,622 
We continue to draw data from satellites 

145 
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:03,936 
But we can say that there are 12 strikes 
Came in the Pacific 

146 
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:05,642 
"Doctor," Chan 

147 
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:08,469 
I think our team is following up that 

148 
00:14:08,469 --> 00:14:14,242 
This media has been since the early 
Following information is still 

149 
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,468 
Yes, we have information we received from one of Mlahzina 

150 
00:14:20,813 --> 00:14:29,999 
Network tracking meteoroid 
Analyze the information, but still there is a possibility that the reason for this may be guilty 

151 
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:36,908 
If this is true 
Vsnchahd significant meteor activity 

152 
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:38,250 
How could the volume of the rock? 

153 
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,748 
Any size to the size of small trucks 

154 
00:14:40,748 --> 00:14:48,454 
The bad news -- 
The collision of the meteor may cause the body to change the course of Heaven -- 

155 
00:14:48,999 --> 00:14:51,231 
May be on its way to us 

156 
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:52,332 
Size and shape and weight 

157

And a collision with us may end life as we know it 

162 
00:15:10,804 --> 00:15:12,282 
This is the worst that could happen 

163 
00:15:12,282 --> 00:15:17,519 
The time remaining before the collision -- 
Which we are still, but I think the day or two -- 

164 
00:15:18,148 --> 00:15:21,834 
"Unfortunately, if" Cassandra 
Must cite the earlier 

165 
00:15:22,148 --> 00:15:27,534 
For if we Dharbnaha and is close to our air 
Output of the blast 

166 
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,397 
Would be catastrophic 

167 
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:35,252 
Well, to begin to act 

168 
00:15:35,877 --> 00:15:36,617 
"Chuck"

And a point of objection, which can in less than 30 minutes 

170 
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:53,239 
Do not want you to tell me how too early

Stark, "moving away will not do my best" -- 
.... Is not the captain -- 

174 
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:12,345 
This is not enough 

175 
00:16:12,345 --> 00:16:14,002 
That "Calvin" You know 

176 
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:16,027

But does not see what is happening 
Abroad?

00:16:20,003 --> 00:16:23,179 
Tom, "but I put it on Rkpetk" 

180 
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:24,723 
Please 

181 
00:16:25,742 --> 00:16:29,001 
Will not move away. Well

Take some comfort 

185 
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:59,376 
Come on, darling -- 
But all he tried to contact the lines were jammed at a later time -- 

186 
00:17:12,408 --> 00:17:18,128 
Follow this story, the report confirms the existence of 
Meteorites fall in California

Meteorites fall to the largest recorded on the planet 
Throughout history 

190 
00:17:50,532 --> 00:17:52,172 
It is beautiful

You are not to go

00:19:09,808 --> 00:19:11,666 
One must pay bills 

205 
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,338 
Should not have to deal with all of this on your own -- 
Hai Hai --

00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:50,478 
Want to come to look? 

219

How bad the situation?

00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:55,352 
See for yourself

You are you the opportunity to watch the news 
This morning?

No electricity is still cut off

00:20:10,727 --> 00:20:13,791 
Some of these things had fallen 
Sometime in the evening 

225 
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,759 
Strange display of the fall of meteorites

Most of them landed in the Pacific Ocean

Will use the coordinates of their years 
Contact will make mistakes again 

242 
00:21:56,045 --> 00:21:57,729 
No signal

320 
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:19,596 
They are exaggerating 

321 
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:29,045 
Only Fekry 
A hot bath. A hot bath

00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,005 
Adjalk may come out of this

00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:22,861 
Stopped fighting the water 

333 
00:28:23,139 --> 00:28:26,747 
Yes, our house is a hit 
But everyone here terrified

In all radio and TV stations 
What they say

00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,713 
Away from the road 

341 
00:29:12,932 --> 00:29:15,747 
As the organizers of the traffic

00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:26,477 
I was in the city, people store water and supplies 
The next thing will be hiding in their homes 

345 
00:29:26,477 --> 00:29:29,339 
And then life will be cheap

Are your plans for a fishing trip?

You know the duck season soon 

351 
00:29:43,291 --> 00:29:45,885 
Today is a day to stay within the appropriate doors 

352 
00:29:46,652 --> 00:29:49,545 
What if the problems occurred? 

353 
00:29:50,266 --> 00:29:52,733 
Some men will need the table beside your keyboard -- 

354 
00:29:52,733 --> 00:29:57,775 
I need people to remain calm and carry weapons -- 

355 
00:30:00,525 --> 00:30:03,744 
I have not heard that martial law 
Announced

359 
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:13,214 
This would not be in your favor 

360 
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:14,777 
Do you threaten me?

We have been given the title to your partner 

797 
01:10:44,926 --> 01:10:47,380 
Calvin was "here" 

798 
01:10:47,674 --> 01:10:48,615 
Since when? 

799 
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:52,674 
Since the half-hour -- 
Is Akbertih Where is she? --

01:11:19,725 --> 01:11:21,248 
Come on locomotive 

806 
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,904 
Now, officially we do not have places 

807 
01:12:02,438 --> 01:12:03,530 
Well 

808 
01:12:08,248 --> 01:12:11,781

A good brother to help you 

812 
01:12:35,748 --> 01:12:36,923 
You are a good man 

813 
01:13:01,034 --> 01:13:02,003 
US-Mexican border 

814 
01:13:11,836 --> 01:13:13,648 
Allen come to talk with me? 

815 
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:22,602 
You Dyke volatile mood 

816 
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:27,195 
We all will die 
But when she speaks to me 

817 
01:13:27,462 --> 01:13:31,040 
I work 35 years ago 
The first I've heard people say this 

818 
01:13:31,820 --> 01:13:35,026 
I am aware I am -- 
Moment Ms -- 

819 
01:13:36,585 --> 01:13:41,445 
It is said that a meteor strike 
"Computer" in Nevada 

820 
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:46,820 
We do not have Internet 
So I can not verify your identity so that works 

821 
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:54,054 
Do you know what happens when you hit the guilty class 
The first guilty last 

822 
01:13:54,914 --> 01:13:56,774 
Not Ms -- 
It is of course -- 

823 
01:13:57,354 --> 01:14:02,777 
Orbit becomes undefined 
Only if it knew how to consider 

824 
01:14:05,977 --> 01:14:09,323 
And when it hits the ground 

825 
01:14:11,572 --> 01:14:14,852 
We all come back to our creator 

826 
01:14:16,999 --> 01:14:18,264 
You are a man of faith 

827 
01:14:19,220 --> 01:14:23,314

01:14:35,844 --> 01:14:44,782 
Contact the "Ji. Me. The" tell them that you have 
Daniel Lehman, "a computer and have the necessary equations," 
Will write to you 

832 
01:14:45,096 --> 01:14:47,064 
Please do not have the time 

833 
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:52,958

Take it this way 

838 
01:15:13,532 --> 01:15:16,462 
Where would you go to the second floor is not stable -- 
My son should be brought -- 

839 
01:15:47,048 --> 01:15:48,593 
Accounts 

840 
01:15:48,922 --> 01:15:50,562 
Orbit, "Cassandra" at the most 

841 
01:15:51,499 --> 01:15:53,813 
That we have with a blind 
But hitting is better than never 

842 
01:15:58,656 --> 01:16:01,452 
We have 11 minutes 
Maximum 30-minute 

843 
01:16:01,939 --> 01:16:05,377 
Will enter our atmosphere 
Must cite before becoming close 

844 
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:08,242 
Enter the data 
Will hit in 5 minutes 

845 
01:16:10,689 --> 01:16:15,046 
Sir we will -- 
Dr. "Chuck" There is contact with you -- 

846 
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,156 
Wait -- 
Permission from Mr. President -- 

847 
01:16:18,472 --> 01:16:20,501 
They help, "Lehman" may have the data 

848 
01:16:23,078 --> 01:16:29,595 
Aimjn "I had over the equations Cassandra" -- 
I know I'm trying, but there is always a mistake -- 

849 
01:16:29,804 --> 01:16:31,814 
The figures do not fit 

850 
01:16:31,814 --> 01:16:37,439 
This is what Dr. tried "Lehman" Akhbarak by 
Equations has the right to intervene in your network 

851 
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:41,878 
"Aimjn" -- 
We must rely on a mini-computer was used objects -- 

852 
01:16:42,314 --> 01:16:45,440 
We are preparing for the launch -- 
Give me 5 minutes -- 

853 
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:50,547 
I want now coordinates 

854 
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:51,384 
Hours have passed since the 
Dr. See "Lehman" These figures 

855 
01:16:51,792 --> 01:16:53,104 
Are we will defer the launch? 

856 
01:16:53,745 --> 01:16:55,356 
Aimjn "now now" 

857 
01:16:55,588 --> 01:16:57,658 
Will call in about two minutes -- 
Well, here it is --

01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:03,220 
We have found it - was never 
General -- 

860 
01:17:03,573 --> 01:17:04,886 
I found the coordinates 

861 
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:07,198 
Will put you on the loudspeaker 
Give me the coordinates are now 

862 
01:17:09,376 --> 01:17:17,980 
Coordinates, "Cassandra" from 
5-17-46/0-2-20-0-6 

863 
01:17:18,777 --> 01:17:22,323 
Are we ever programming? -- 
Are you sure of these figures? -- 

864 
01:17:22,323 --> 01:17:25,027 
I'm sure more than anything with us 

865 
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:27,857 
It was a "Lehman" genius "-- 
You are expelled, and he is crazy -- 

866 
01:17:28,604 --> 01:17:31,512 
Sir -- 
We will program the new figures -- 

867 
01:17:32,188 --> 01:17:34,777 
Adharbha strongly 
To be fatal to the planets 

868 
01:17:34,777 --> 01:17:37,371 
Thank you, Miss 
I think we knew this 

869

872 
01:17:57,277 --> 01:17:58,355

873 
01:18:14,950 --> 01:18:16,046 
They are on their way 

874 
01:18:16,923 --> 01:18:18,672 
If we do not have a radar 
How will we know if Esbnaha? 

875 
01:18:19,139 --> 01:18:20,609 
Will follow us, a window

01:18:20,998 --> 01:18:24,356 
Bring ???? "O'Neill" to the air base 
Want her at the place of secure communication 

877 
01:18:24,356 --> 01:18:27,075 
It does not fly 
There will be many Meteorites 

878 
01:18:27,075 --> 01:18:29,027 
Suspended all flights 
Even the military 

879

I'm not sure 

884 
01:18:53,641 --> 01:18:59,015 
I revise the equations 
Dr. "Lehman" something wrong 

885 
01:19:09,687 --> 01:19:11,966 
Time -- 
One minute of the collision -- 

886

But you forgot the goal of this 

920 
01:23:14,692 --> 01:23:17,536 
I want you to feel what I feel 

921

Nice, does not it? -- 

926 
01:23:41,962 --> 01:23:43,885 
These things will fall 

927 
01:23:43,885 --> 01:23:45,731 
Must be something Nanmy 

928 
01:23:46,386 --> 01:23:47,038 
Now 

929 
01:23:56,273 --> 01:23:57,978 
Held 

930 
01:23:58,524 --> 01:23:59,952 
Inside 

931 
01:24:05,981 --> 01:24:06,917 
"Michael" 

932 
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:08,834 
"Michael" 

933 
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:17,243 
"Michael" 

934 
01:24:18,012 --> 01:24:19,669 
I'm your mother 
Do you hear me? 

935 
01:24:38,650 --> 01:24:39,586 
Rear stairs 

936 
01:24:58,397 --> 01:24:59,338 
Darn 

937 
01:25:00,336 --> 01:25:01,262 
"Michael" 

938 
01:25:46,618 --> 01:25:47,514 
"Qhozi" 

939 
01:25:47,852 --> 01:25:48,559 
"Michael" 

940 
01:25:50,121 --> 01:25:50,994 
Do you hear? 

941 
01:26:00,777 --> 01:26:02,149 
"Qhozi" 

942 
01:26:26,902 --> 01:26:28,292 
"Qhozi" 

943 
01:26:30,150 --> 01:26:32,978 
Look at the bright side 
I did 

944 
01:26:34,245 --> 01:26:34,967 
The Angztina 

945 
01:26:36,061 --> 01:26:39,451 
No, I do 
Should have been to see this early 

946 
01:26:42,120 --> 01:26:43,247 
What is wrong 

947 
01:26:43,650 --> 01:26:47,947 
Space object had to be up early 
And somewhere in Europe 

948 
01:26:47,947 --> 01:26:50,623 
Everything opposed to the equations 

949 
01:26:51,090 --> 01:26:52,653 
Unfortunately, not Affhmk 

950 
01:26:53,234 --> 01:26:56,276 
Here 
From the beginning of a misjudgment 

951 
01:26:56,276 --> 01:26:59,172 
Dr. "Lehman" a mistake in the calculation of 
Mass of the comet 

952 
01:27:00,684 --> 01:27:04,496 
Orb Astdemb "Cassandra" already 
But not sent to the surface only 

953 
01:27:05,121 --> 01:27:05,979 
Well 

954 
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:08,340 
The dividing them into two halves 

955 
01:27:09,419 --> 01:27:10,174

961 
01:28:13,732 --> 01:28:15,952
