<i>You Who Came From the Stars</i>

2
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,090
<i>Please look over here!</i>

3
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,100
<i>Excuse me!</i>

4
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,190
Are you saying she eventually went
 aboard that boat wearing those shoes?

5
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:37,860
Yes.

6
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,850
And, you're still here?!

7
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,820
Will you be okay not going?

8
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,880
Lawyer Jang.

9
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,430
Yes?

10
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,080
I've lived in this place for 400 years.

11
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:10,300
There's been many, many occurrences. 
Some too awful even to be imagined.

12
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,280
<i>Mother, Father! I've come home!</i>

13
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,380
<i>I've come home! Mother!</i>

14
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,980
<i>My Lady!</i>

15
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,860
<i>My Lord! The lady has returned!</i>

16
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,150
<i>The Lady, who was said to have 
died, has returned!</i>

17
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,910
<i>My Lord! Please come out!</i>

18
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,170
<i>My Lord!</i>

19
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,590
<i>Mother!</i>

20
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,020
<i>What has happened, my daughter?</i>

21
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:59,280
<i>With only knowing that you had died, I prayed so 
much that you did not die a painful death.</i>

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,550
<i>Let me look at your face.</i>

23
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,890
<i>I did almost die, Mother.</i>

24
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,340
<i>The in-laws tried to kill me.</i>

25
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,190
<i>To get what they want for 'A Virtuous Woman'.</i>

26
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,950
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

27
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:14,960
<i>Is there not anywhere you've been hurt?</i>

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,980
<i>Yes. I'm fine, Father.</i>

29
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,180
<i>The man over there saved me 
and helped me return here.</i>

30
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:35,760
<i>That man is my life's savior.</i>

31
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,890
<i>I shoulder a great gratitude towards you
 for saving my daughter.</i>

32
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,060
<i>I don't know what I should do to repay you.</i>

33
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,360
<i>I hope that you'll think of this place as your own home
 while you're here. Please eat and rest comfortably.</i>

34
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,310
<i>Why...?</i>

35
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,440
<i>Living in a dirty manner,</i>

36
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,980
<i>is not better than dying cleanly.</i>

37
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,360
This is what I've taught you.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,420
You've defiled your body

39
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,420
<i>and soiled this household's honor with embarrassment.</i>

40
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,720
Knowing this, how could you have 
stepped foot back into this house?

41
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,610
<i>Mother...</i>

42
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,610
<i>Die!</i>

43
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:27,940
<i>You are already a dead daughter to the nation, so just die!</i>

44
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,100
<i>Please!</i>

45
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,770
<i>Please save me! Save me!</i>

46
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,740
<i>Hurry and run away.</i>

47
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,180
<i>Go, hurry!</i>

48
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:08,060
<i>If your father comes, you and I will 
both die in his hands.</i>

49
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,110
I argued with him that if we were to 
 kill our child, I would do it myself.

50
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,130
Go already!

51
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:23,540
<i>Go anywhere</i>

52
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:26,540
<i>and live in secrecy as if you were dead.</i>

53
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,440
<i>Mother.</i>

54
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:35,560
<i>Why did you bring an unknown stranger with you?</i>

55
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:43,540
To your father, the family's honor is 
 more important than his child's life.

56
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,420
<i>Did you really not know that?</i>

57
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,770
<i>That person...is someone who saved my life...</i>

58
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,450
<i>Mother! What about that person?
 What happened to that person?</i>

59
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,290
<i>Is he not dead yet?</i>

60
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,160
<i>What is going on?</i>

61
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,930
He ate the rice porridge with the poison.

62
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,530
<i>He should have died by now. 
 So, I'm not sure why he isn't dead.</i>

63
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:22,890
<i>The pharmacists don't have any idea why, either.</i>

64
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:43,070
The pain that I thought I would never forget

65
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,940
passed away over time.

66
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:53,150
I don't really understand since 
 I haven't lived such a long time.

67
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:57,320
But I do get these thoughts as I live.

68
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,100
People...

69
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,490
live really diligently even though
 they know they're going to die.

70
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,510
Even though they know they will break up at some point,

71
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,630
when they love, they love like
 there's no tomorrow.

72
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:18,290
These childish beings are exactly what people are.

73
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,940
Things will get better as time passes.

74
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,330
It could even become as if it never happened.

75
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:32,450
But...although the future is important, 
isn't the present just as important?

76
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:37,420
Are you confident that you will be okay

77
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,710
if something bad really does happen to that person?

78
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,380
<i>The child star, Cheon Song Yi, who became famous with her popular chocolate CF, made her first drama appearance</i>

79
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:06,310
<i>in a historical drama that would have been 
difficult even for an adult actress.</i>

80
00:08:06,310 --> 00:08:09,550
<i>Aside from the fact that she was the main character's child actress, despite her young age,</i>

81
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,740
<i>she became a high class star
 with her mature and graceful image.</i>

82
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,550
<i>All the dramas and movies she has 
acted in have been hits.</i>

83
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:23,610
<i>Even now, she is continuing to show 
herself as the nation's very own 'goddess'.</i>

84
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,390
<i>First love?</i>

85
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,490
<i>Ah, the question is so tacky!</i>

86
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,120
<i>Ah, first love...</i>

87
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:36,210
<i>Well, I have gone on a couple of dates,</i>

88
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:42,150
<i>but there's no one who I would
 call my 'first love' yet.</i>

89
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:45,850
<i>Although, when I was young, there was a time 
when I could have gotten into a big accident.</i>

90
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,630
<i>But, there was a man who saved me.</i>

91
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:55,370
<i>I can't really think of his face, but he was 
rather tall, and he was the warm, gentle type.</i>

92
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,000
<i>It was the best.</i>

93
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,820
<i>Though it was just a short moment,
 it was very mysterious,</i>

94
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,290
<i>and warm at the same time.</i>

95
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:13,790
<i>I still remember it.</i>

96
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:17,820
<i>I don't know if that man will remember me though.</i>

97
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:23,960
<i>But you know, if I see that person, I 
think I would recognize him immediately.</i>

98
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,180
<i>Just like 'Fate'.</i>

99
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,710
<i>60 hours later</i>

100

With the bizarre case that top actress' 
been missing during cruise party

101
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,740
The whole country's been restless for 3 days.

102
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,040
When searching around the Han River at 4pm today

103
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,660
to the south of Seo Gang University,

104
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,880
a body was found

105
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,490
The body is being identified.

106
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,680
A lot of reporters are waiting at the scene

107
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:40,000
and trying to get a hold of what happened.

108
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:53,590
<i>My Love From the Star
Episode 4</i>

109
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,740
Did you check the identification?

110
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,330
We're investigating. We're investigating.

111
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:08,500
Why are you being like this? I'm going to die.

112
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,900
I won't do it.

113
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,140
From my experience this is a suicide for sure.

114
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,810
She was taking antidepressants,

115
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:19,210
and she even left a twitter message a few days before she died saying

116
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,550
"what should I do when it's so hard to live".

117
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,600
I listened to all the people at the site.

118
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,590
They said she was really drunk. Really drunk.

119
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,280
The answer comes out immediately.

120
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:31,620
A top actress could not overcome depression,

121
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,130
and suicided because of alcohol. This is it.

122
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,600
Our prosecutor is new

123
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,300
so he's over-passionate.

124
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:42,180
He wants to know as much as he can for now.

125
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,790
Why does a case like this have to happen in our area?

126
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,690
I can't work because of the reporters.

127
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,480
We have to end the case soon.

128
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,950
What are you doing?

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,770
Here.

130
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,710
You're Officer Park, right?

131
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,480
- Nice to meet you. I am...
- Yeah I know. Thank you.

132
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,950
Could you please finish this case soon?

133
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,630
Bereaved families don't want to carry out autopsy.

134
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:20,350
According to forensics, there was no sign of resistance.

135
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:24,390
She was not hit by any object either.

136
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,080
- It's like that.
- Oh is that so?

137
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,460
It's so obvious.

138
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,660
- From my experience, this is definitely...
- Should we start from checking the CCTV?

139
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,360
I already kind of

140
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,880
checked all of it.
- You can't kind of checked it.

141
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,000
You have to check it carefully.

142
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,410
There were 7 people invited in total on that day.

143
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,140
After checking all their identification

144
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,330
They entered.

145
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,820
It was a place where no one could go in 
except guests and workers.

146
00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,550
The bride and the groom were stars and they were related to conglomerates so

147
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,150
If you see the guest's faces

148
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:05,680
you recognize them. Most of the people there were like that.

149
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,220
This is a red carpet.

150
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,360
<i>The day of the incident</i>

151
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,110
<i>Oh so cold.</i>

152
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,950
<i>Look at the goosebumps on my arm.</i>

153
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,240
<i>I'm so cold.</i>

154
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:22,100
<i>Who told you to wear something so revealing?</i>

155
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,980
<i>Wear the ones with long sleeves. Like turtle necks that come up to here.</i>

156
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,450
<i>I'm so cold.</i>

157
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,860
<i>Why can't the managers come in?</i>

158
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:31,290
<i>They're worried that pictures leak out.</i>

159
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:33,640
<i>- Why are they making such a big fuss?
- That's right.</i>

160
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,160
<i>Let's not make a big fuss and get through this quietly.</i>

161
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:39,420
<i>Like at a Catholic church. So the right mood would resonate.</i>

162
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,610
<i>Please do that. I'll elegantly bring lots of money</i>

163
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:44,160
<i>And go for sure.</i>

164
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,730
<i>- I'll be sad if you're just saying empty words.
- I don't say things like empty words.</i>

165
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,950
<i>- Oh Oppa.
- Hyung.</i>

166
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:54,520
<i>- Hello Oppa.
- It's been such a long time.</i>

167
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,590
<i>- You're doing well, right?
- Yes. Good to see you.</i>

168
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,540
<i>By the way, I'm curious about something.</i>

169
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,840
<i>Do you have someone you're dating?</i>

170
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,170
<i>- Why?
- It's just that Han Yoo Ra</i>

171
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:07,630
<i>said she was going to marry a guy from SC Group.</i>

172
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,850
<i>There's only two sons in that household. You and</i>

173
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,950
<i>Hui Kyeong.</i>

174
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,240
<i>It's not me. I don't even know Han Yoo Ra.</i>

175
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,390
<i>If you're talking about Han Yoo Ra, then she's our department store's model,</i>

176
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,080
<i>but I just know her face.</i>

177
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,200
<i>I know, right? Han Yoo Ra. I knew it.</i>

178
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:27,110
<i>How can she lie so sincerely?</i>

179
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,940
<i>Try acting like that.</i>

180
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,620
<i>Hey. People are watching.</i>

181
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:35,600
<i>There're rumors that you're not friendly with Han Yoo Ra already.</i>

182
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:37,610
<i>It's true that we don't get along.</i>

183
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,100
<i>Where's the waiting room for a bride?</i>

184
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,000
<i>Omo Unni.</i>

185
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,880
<i>You're probably busy preparing for the wedding.</i>

186
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:59,060
<i>When did you go and come back from the hospital?</i>

187
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:01,610
<i>Your that assiduous part is</i>

188
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,140
<i>Something I should emulate.</i>

189
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,980
<i>I changed a bit. Does it look okay?</i>

190
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,990
<i>You look so young that Suzy will come 
and try to be friends with you.</i>

191
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,170
<i>Hey, it's not that good.</i>

192
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:15,800
<i>Congratulations Seo Young.</i>

193
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,740
<i>Thank you.</i>

194
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,890
<i>Oh right.</i>

195
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:25,200
<i>I'm going to get your bouquet.</i>

196
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,810
<i>Na Rae Mi said she was catching my bouquet.</i>

197
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:30,150
<i>She said she broke up with her boyfriend.</i>

198
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:33,190
<i>Then what about you? Do you have someone?</i>

199
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,070
<i>Are you going to get married?</i>

200
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,700
<i>You're doing fireworks at midnight?</i>

201
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,160
<i>Yes.</i>

202
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,790
<i>Keep your expectations up.</i>

203
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,840
<i>There will be a surprise announcement at that time.</i>

204
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,940
<i>You're holding an event at other people's weddings?</i>

205
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:56,810
<i>You're copying other people's shoes too now?</i>

206
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:01,620
<i>I didn't copy anybody.</i>

207
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:05,440
<i>- I am the first one in our nation to...
- Why do you guys fight whenever you meet?</i>

208
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,460
<i>Just stand at the side. We're going to take pictures.</i>

209
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:10,240
<i>- Please take a picture of us.
- Yes.</i>

210
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,000
<i>Please gather closely around the bride.</i>

211
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,150
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>

212
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,150
<i>Please take it. Now.</i>

213
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:36,120
<i>I closed my eyes. Take one more please.</i>

214
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,360
<i>So pretty.</i>

215
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:02,680
<i>We're taking a picture. Look here please. 1, 2, 3.</i>

216
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:12,010
<i>Where's Han Yoo Ra?</i>

217
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:14,220
<i>I haven't seen her. Why?</i>

218
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,830
<i>I met her in the restroom a while ago. She left this.</i>

219
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,130
<i>Did you guys fight again?</i>

220
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:21,400
<i>Am I somebody that fights every day?</i>

221
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,040
<i>I'm hungry. Is this all?</i>

222
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:28,370
<i>You want something else? 
They have foie gras and caviar.</i>

223
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,250
<i>You eat those things.</i>

224
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,150
<i>Excuse me.</i>

225
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:36,490
<i>Do you have spoon worms here?</i>

226
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,870
<i>Excuse me?</i>

227
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,890
<i>Hey. Why are you looking for things like that here?</i>

228
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,160
<i>We are next to the water. Shouldn't I eat that at least?</i>

229
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,140
<i>Soju and spoon warms. Perfect fit.</i>

230
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,810
<i>Why?</i>

231
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,160
<i>Are you embarrassed of me?</i>

232
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,700
<i>No.</i>

233
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,550
<i>Director Park?</i>

234
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,510
<i>How have you been?</i>

235
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,830
<i>You're making a new movie, right?</i>

236
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,580
<i>I saw the scenario. It was really good.</i>

237
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,900
<i>Why was that sent to you?</i>

238
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,860
<i>We were thoroughly on the security.</i>

239
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,040
<i>What?</i>

240
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,230
<i>You gave it to Song Yi.</i>

241
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,180
<i>I saw a bit of it while Song Yi was reading it.</i>

242
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,510
<i>If you have a good role, call me too please.</i>

243
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,880
<i>Yes. We'll see.</i>

244
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:55,870
<i>Sometime</i>

245
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:59,330
<i>you should come over and have a drink.</i>

246
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,070
<i>Pardon?</i>

247
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,110
<i>You told me to call you over.</i>

248
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:07,610
<i>I'll call you sometime, so just come.</i>

249
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:11,070
<i>Is that movie even going to be crank in?</i>

250
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,100
<i>You can make it only if someone invests.</i>

251
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,210
<i>Director Park Yoo Kon, your movie can be made only if S&amp;C Entertainment invests in it.</i>

252
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:23,740
<i>If they don't invest, then you can't make it.</i>

253
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,840
<i>Who are you?</i>

254
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,160
<i>I'm S&amp;C Lee Hwi Kyeong's younger brother Lee Hui Kyeong.</i>

255
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:35,380
<i>My brother decided to invest in something like this,</i>

256
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,390
<i>but that guy has no artistic sense so he doesn't know much about art.</i>

257
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:41,910
<i>He always asks me to tell him if its interesting or not.</i>

258
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,860
<i>I saw the scenario.</i>

259
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,170
<i>It was boring.</i>

260
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,540
<i>So I told him to not invest.</i>

261
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,090
<i>I did that.</i>

262
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,290
<i>Hey.</i>

263
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:02,350
<i>- Why did you do that?
- Why else?</i>

264
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:04,360
<i>Have you not heard the rumors about him?</i>

265
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,610
<i>He's like a gangster.</i>

266
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,520
<i>Don't come into contact with guys like that. Got it?</i>

267
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:12,450
<i>I got it. Let go of this.</i>

268
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:17,230
And also, apart from me, all men are wolves.

269
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:19,740
If you ever get a boyfriend, tell me.

270
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,430
After I get to see him and say he's fine,
 you can date him only then.

271
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,180
Who do you think you are?

272
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:27,750
Me?

273
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:30,350
I'm...

274
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,470
your BFF's soon to be husband.

275
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,290
By the way, where did your BFF go?

276
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,400
She went to get a drink.

277
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,820
Again?

278
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,880
Ah, Cheon Song Yi. 
Is she a goddess of alcohol or something?

279
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,370
How come she must see the end whenever she drinks?

280
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,980
Song Yi, it's dangerous over ther-

281
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:01,910
Hey, be careful. 
Are you okay?

282
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,650
Yes, I'm fine.

283
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:12,230
Where did Song Yi go?

284
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,430
You said she went to drink.

285
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,220
She was there just a moment ago.

286
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,550
Did something happen?
There's still an hour left until it's over.

287
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:43,020
It seems like someone's disappeared.

288
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,920
A person? Who?

289
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,020
Hey, Se Mi. Did something happen?

290
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,390
Song Yi has disappeared.

291
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:54,820
We can't find no matter how hard we look.

292
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:57,160
What? My Nuna?

293
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,690
And...Yu Ra has disappeared too.

294
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,860
People are looking for them inside, right now.

295
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,240
What?

296
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:37,290
Cheon Song Yi!

297
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:40,410
This way.

298
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,390
How much did you drink?

299
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:47,170
At the moment, it was 1:42 AM.

300
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:50,980
Ms. Cheon Song Yi was the last person to get off the cruise.

301
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,210
<i>Prosecutor Yoo Seok</i>
We investigated later but couldn't find Han Yoo Ra.

302
00:22:57,350 --> 00:23:00,200
What is the estimated time of the death?

303
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,860
Ah, this.

304
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:05,450
The last time she was seen...

305
00:23:05,450 --> 00:23:06,550
Ah,

306
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:10,500
she was last in the women's toilets with Cheon Song Yi.

307
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,890
I heard they fought a little then.

308
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,830
And that was around 11:30PM, they said.

309
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,360
Since people found out that Han Yu Ra disappeared around 12:30,

310
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,960
then during that one hour this incident occurred.

311
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:31,430
Aigoo. Prosecutor, reporters keep calling me.

312
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,670
They're asking if it's because of Cheon Song Yi that Han Yu Ra became like that.

313
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,900
How is Han Yu Ra dying because of Cheon Song Yi?

314
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:43,210
I don't know. Their relationship wasn't very good or something. Anyway, that's what the rumours say.

315
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:48,310
The worse rumors the stronger.

316
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,250
A long time ago, at the well in town,

317
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:54,870
all rumours started.

318
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,850
Nowadays, instead of at the well,

319
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:00,600
around coffee vending machines, cafes, pubs,

320
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:03,300
rest area, internet blogs, and so on.

321
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:06,210
Anywhere people hang around and rest,

322
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,180
rumours start.

323
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,520
To the extent that they could kill a person,

324
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,710
those deadly rumors.

325
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,640
Did you hear that? 
After Han Yoo Ra was fed up with Cheon Song Yi,

326
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:18,350
she committed suicide because her depression got worse.

327
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,350
I heard she (Cheon Song Yi) harassed (Han Yoo Ra) a lot.

328
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:21,470
Really?

329
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,780
Cheon Song Yi didn't come to school today, right?

330
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:28,110
After doing such thing, wouldn't it be even more weird if she wanders about?

331
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:32,200
Have you seen the video uploaded on YouTube?
Cheon Song Yi is really no joke.

332
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,510
What is it, what is it?

333
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:35,240
Look.

334
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,810
<i>How is it that when people get together, they talk about me and my dramas?</i>

335
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:41,550
<i>It seems they have nothing better to talk about.</i>

336
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,060
<i>Fine.</i>

337
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,480
Oh my, she's no joke.

338
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:48,420
<i>With doing rating 4% drama, who doesn't even know who started and ended</i>

339
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,270
<i>More than no-one knowing it. 
Ah, that's right.</i>

340
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,570
<i>Your drama just finished at 4% ratings, right?</i>

341
00:24:55,570 --> 00:24:57,180
Oh my.

342
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,820
I really don't get women. Seriously.

343
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,490
I'm speechless.

344
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,890
Aigoo, it's a big problem.

345
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,980
Oppa, I brought this juice for you.

346
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,600
<i>This afternoon, at the Han River, the corpse found </i>

347
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,350
<i>was revealed to be top talent Han Yoo Ra.</i>

348
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,840
<i>Ms. Han attended actress Noh So Young's
 wedding on the 23rd</i>

349
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:27,670
<i>And went missing. So the police started their investigation after her manager reported.</i>

350
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:33,130
<i>Many people are in a shock by the death of an actress who remained in the top for a long time.</i>

351
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:39,620
<i>There's been an assumption that Han Yoo Ra's death is caused by a troubles between her and an actress Ms. C.</i>

352
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,850
<i>Yoo Ra had depression.</i>

353
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:47,550
<i>But it's true that it got worse because of Cheon Song Yi.
[Park Il Woo, Han Yoo Ra's manager]</i>

354
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:53,310
<i>Honestly, being humiliated and talked down at in front of everyone, by someone younger than yourself,</i>

355
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,560
<i>who wouldn't be angry?</i>

356
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,980
<i>Because our Yu Ra was kind hearted,</i>

357
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,430
<i>she tried so hard to endure, but</i>

358
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,260
<i>even the day before she died, she said that because of OOO,</i>

359
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,580
<i>she was having a really hard time.</i>

360
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,390
Eish!

361
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:28,800
<i>It's shocking that the dead body found in the river was the top actress, Han Yoo Ra.</i>

362
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,670
Don't exchange the mangas secretly.

363
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:40,550
Please don't do that! 
You, who play billiards with Tiger Woods and get your computer fixed by Steve Jobs, shouldn't do that.

364
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,930
That's only 80 cents.

365
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,770
You know, those who owns a lot (wealthy) are supposed to be worse.

366
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:48,220
Do you know money is earned from nothing?

367
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:52,300
But, what happened?

368
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,000
So they are saying that Han Yoo Ra committed suicide

369
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,810
because Cheon Song Yi harassed her, right?

370
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,050
Cheon Song Yi is really evil.

371
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:04,170
I was planning to marry her, I guess I have to 
 remove her from my "womens list".

372
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:09,620
Hey! It's true that Cheon Song Yi has a bad personality,
 but she's not that sort of a person!

373
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,270
She's one of my friends, so I know her well.

374
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,050
Why are you laughing?

375
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:21,890
You told us not to lie, but you're saying she's your friend?

376
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:24,440
You've gone too far, too far. Why?

377
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,440
You should just say Chun Song Yi comes here often.

378
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,400
What a lie, really.

379
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,770
The articles aren't very good.

380
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,630
The public is also deteriorating.

381
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,840
Reporter Choi, you won't answer your phone?

382
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,980
You only call me Hyungnim when I buy you drinks and play golf with you?

383
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:53,200
Bomi, hurry. Go to Song Yi's house and protect her.

384
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,750
If reporters bulge in, it'll be out of control.

385
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,530
Yes!

386
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,810
<i>Nuna.</i>

387
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:28,390
What?

388
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,850
Come to the back parking lot, hurry!

389
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,660
Why? Did filming get scheduled?

390
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:38,380
<i>Have you not seen the news?</i>

391
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:42,080
She died?

392
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,410
<i>Yes.</i>

393
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,700
How? Was it an accident?
What happened?

394
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,340
<i>We don't know that much yet.</i>

395
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,490
Why?

396
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,710
<i>Firstly, come out. 
The reporters are going up so hurry!</i>

397
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,600
<i>Quickly take the elevator! Quickly!</i>

398
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,770
I'm going you bastard!

399
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:04,190
<i>No! Not the elevator!</i>

400
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:05,610
No? Why not?

401
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,900
<i>The reporters have taken the elevator. 
The emergency exit!</i>

402
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,400
The emergency exit?

403
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:11,390
<i>No!</i>

404
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:13,850
No? No? What is it now?

405
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,860
<i>A few have gone up that way too.
Just go back inside for now.</i>

406
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,540
Go back in?

407
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:23,570
Hey! Why do I have to run away?

408
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,460
<i>Can we not talk about that now?</i>

409
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,720
<i>We don't have time!</i>

410
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,020
Is that so?

411
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,680
Hey,

412
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,040
what's the password to my house?

413
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,250
<i>I don't know. You changed it.</i>

414
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:40,400
So what number did I change it to?!!

415
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,310
Eish!

416
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,050
Wait a moment! Wait!

417
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,520
Cheon Song Yi!

418
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:12,990
Are you sure she's at home?

419
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:15,420
Yes. I overheard her manger on the phone.

420
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,960
Then, she'll come out soon.

421
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:25,080
What is th-

422
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,850
<i>Cheon Song Yi is home, but she's not coming out.</i>

423
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,440
Please just let it go.

424
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,130
If I go out now,

425
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:36,610
I will be bitten to death by those people.

426
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:46,250
I'm very sorry for saying these words in this situation,

427
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:50,890
but do you have any ramen or cold rice?

428
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:56,300
I didn't eat well last night, so I'm a little hungry.

429
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,420
Get out.

430
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:04,880
I said, get out.

431
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,810
<i>Yes, Vice President.</i>

432
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,060
Then you can just give it to me as a whole.

433
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,610
In searching all over for Cheon Song Yi,

434
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,850
we are, now, in front of the home of 
actress, Cheon Song Yi's home.

435
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:26,800
We came to hear her opinion on the death of Han Yu Ra.

436
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,670
First of all, I'll try ringing the bell.

437
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:35,070
There is no response.

438
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,040
Ah, we'll ask her neighbor over here.

439
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,160
Excuse me, did you see Cheon Song Yi earlier?

440
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,960
Move the camera.

441
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,170
Yes.

442
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,020
What's with him?

443
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,130
Hey, does that make any sense?

444
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:11,320
Why would Han Yu Ra die because of me?
 Are people seriously believing that?

445
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:16,300
<i>Yes, the atmosphere right now isn't good. So,
 I think it's best that you don't leave your house.</i>

446
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,170
<i>You got home safely last night, right?</i>

447
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,050
<i>Please don't go out for a couple of days
 and just stay home, alright?</i>

448
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,090
That...

449
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,460
Aish, the battery.

450
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:37,130
What is this?

451
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,260
He doesn't even have a cell phone
 and he uses a beeper.

452
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,430
Does he not even have a home phone?

453
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,850
Aish, this person. Does he live his life alone?

454
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,580
Am I locked in here right now?

455
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,930
What? I'm tired.

456
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,840
Where's Song Yi?

457
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:05,170
Even at home, am I also just Cheon Song Yi's friend?

458
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:06,520
I'm not your daughter?

459
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,260
What?

460
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:13,720
I received so many calls asking how
 is Cheon Song Yi, so I turned it off.

461
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,680
I can't contact Song Yi, either.

462
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,040
Is that so? That's worrisome.

463
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:21,920
What about oppa?

464
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,280
Your oppa is busy these days.

465
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,860
But it's really strange.

466
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,670
What is?

467
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:29,010
I went somewhere to look at something last time,

468
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:30,770
and they said that there,

469
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,850
that Cheon Song Yi's fame was just up until last year.

470
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,450
That she will face something terrible this year 
and the rest is dark, as if she can't see anything.

471
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:40,230
But for you, they said it's the exact opposite.

472
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:43,260
After Cheon Song Yi's luck fades, your luck blooms.

473
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,950
Mom.

474
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,430
Are you trying to make me disappointed in you?

475
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:50,140
I'm her friend.

476
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:54,600
There are many times I've disliked her, 
but we've been friends for more than 10 years.

477
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,490
Did you think I would like it if I heard something like that?

478
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,910
And also, is Song Yi your daughter?

479
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,520
Why would you look at Song Yi's?

480
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,210
So...

481
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:09,550
until when are you going to live as the second priority?

482
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,150
Do you like being the second priority in your life?

483
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,720
I don't like it.

484
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,780
Since my daughter is the second priority, so am I.

485
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:16,620
-Mom.
--You

486
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,630
Do you know why life is interesting?

487
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:23,030
It's interesting because you don't know what's ahead of you.

488
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,350
It's something you don't know,

489
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,310
how everything may turn around.

490
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:30,340
The Hui Kyeong that you've liked for so long,

491
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,250
you can make him yours,

492
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,190
and you can receive the spotlight that was made just for you.

493
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:37,130
I want my daughter

494
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:40,240
to live that kind of life for once.

495
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:47,130
What kind of mess is this? You said
 it was still under investigation!

496
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:50,650
And, they've said they don't even know if it's a suicide 
or an accident. So, what's with everyone?

497
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:52,150
Don't worry too much.

498
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:54,120
I will try to steer this in the right direction.

499
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,750
Representative.

500
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:58,140
I'm in the middle of a conversation.

501
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:01,450
Right now, there's mayhem happening from advertisers.

502
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:04,650
That we violated the contract about model's quality.

503
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:07,760
They're saying they will back away from the offer.

504
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,170
The people from the drama want to see you, too.

505
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:11,580
Why?

506
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:16,420
They say the viewer ratings are coiling up right now.

507
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:20,080
Well, mother, we will try to guide this
 well, so please go back home for now.

508
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,570
I'll get up now since I have something to finish.

509
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:25,880
Oh, right, Representative Ahn.

510
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:30,230
What I told you last time, about Song Yi's renewal issue.

511
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,620
You said that we should drag it 
out for a month. We'll do that, then.

512
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,650
Pardon?

513
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,580
I said, let's do it like that.

514
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,800
There are times that we've spent together,

515
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,660
I can't just fall over for someone else just 
because they try and persuade me otherwise.

516
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:51,180
I'm not a woman who's that disloyal.

517
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,140
When should I stamp it?

518
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,870
Should I stamp it now while I'm here?

519
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:58,580
Ah, mother, there's no contract that was made for today,

520
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,240
so let's talk about it slowly another time.

521
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:04,430
I will leave first.

522
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,150
<i>This phone is turned off...</i>

523
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,140
What is this girl doing?

524
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,270
Agh, that awful bastard.

525
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,470
I begged like that saying I was hungry.

526
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,400
I crawled over to him once and 
he acted as if I wasn't even there.

527
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,450
This bastard who doesn't acknowledge anything.

528
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,500
They said the tiger comes on its own feet, too.

529
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,400
It probably comes after being begged to.

530
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,520
Do you not want to eat ramen together?

531
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:26,190
Then just sit in front of me, at least.

532
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,300
Why should I?

533
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,050
Because I don't want to eat alone.

534
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,380
Because if I eat alone, I lose my appetite.

535
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:46,180
That bastard who has no taste for people.

536
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,550
That alien-like bastard.

537
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,570
A person is asking you earnestly like 
that, but you just completely ignore them?

538
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,760
What is this? When did I eat all of this?

539
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:13,660
I was going to stop eating after 3 bites.

540
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:17,980
Ah, I'm ruined!

541
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,900
Where exactly is the bathroom?

542
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,130
It seems like he knows his paintings.

543
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,950
It's a complete fake, but it looks real.

544
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Aigoo, what is all this?

545
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:44,530
"Records of my last 3 months on Earth?"

546
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:46,270
What are you doing?

547
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:48,290
Oh, my god, you surprised me.

548
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,880
What are you?

549
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,650
Without any warning!

550
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:53,490
When did you come in?

551
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,410
That's what I want to ask.

552
00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:58,370
When and why did you come in here?

553
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:03,070
I was looking for the bathroom,

554
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,610
but...

555
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,510
what is this place?

556
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,520
And what's all this?

557
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,780
Are you running two jobs?

558
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:16,050
Like buying books and paintings from a long time ago?

559
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,960
Like saving up to pay a debt? Something like that?

560
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,740
Come out.

561
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,190
Get out.

562
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,050
I am sorry about going into your room.

563
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:30,200
How can I get out now?

564
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:31,170
Like I care.

565
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,020
Everyone's thinking how to kill me.

566
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,040
"Should I rip her to death?"
"Should I dry her to death?"

567
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,490
Everyone's like this...

568
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,300
But if they see me coming out of a man's house.

569
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,330
I will really be dust and die.

570
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:43,420
That's none of my business.

571
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:47,820
I think it this way.

572
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,440
It's a duty for a teacher to take care of his student.

573
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:56,140
Even if our society has become heartless,
 the relation between a teacher and a student is...

574
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,100
should not be like this.

575
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:01,130
When the student is in trouble, the teacher could help a bit.

576
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:03,350
Who's your teacher?

577
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:04,170
You?

578
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,760
I've never thought of you as my student, ever.

579
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,320
Get out now if you don't want to be dragged out.

580
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:12,120
HEY! 
(Informal)

581
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,900
Hey?

582
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,180
Let go of this. 
(Informal)

583
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,750
What?

584
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,720
You said you are not my teacher.

585
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,520
I've been using honorifics for nothing. 
I should've just talked informally.

586
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,630
Look here, Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

587
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:23,740
What's up, Mr. Do Min Joon?

588
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,740
Come to think of it, why don't you show me your ID?

589
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,960
How old are you? 
You're younger than me, right?

590
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,580
If I step out of this house, I'm not the one who's going to die.

591
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,800
Mr. Do Min Joon is going to die, too.

592
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,000
Why? Because news articles saying that you're my secret lover will be out.

593
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:45,320
Everyone will know your face. 
Do you want to live a noisy life?

594
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,720
While every little movement of yours 
being watched by people...

595
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,350
That's more terrible than you think.

596
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:55,470
Please let me stay for a while.

597
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,550
I beg you.

598
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,410
First, don't touch anything

599
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,470
in this house.

600
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:10,770
I won't touch anything. I won't.

601
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,880
Second, don't ask me any questions.

602
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,580
I won't ask any. I won't.

603
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:19,340
Then in meaning of thanks, 
 shake hands?

604
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:21,230
Third,

605
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,610
keep your distance from me, 1 meter at least.

606
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:28,600
Ah, what's this?

607
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,080
Keep <i>your</i> distance from me, you.

608
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,040
Do you know whom I make movies with?

609
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:37,110
Jung Woo Sung, Kang Dong Won, Won Bin. 
With such amazing people-

610
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,740
It's so unusual.

611
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,050
It's impossible for a man to not like me.

612
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,330
Does he have a different taste? 
(Is he gay?)

613
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,080
The bereaved families don't want to carry out an autopsy.

614
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:54,890
Police assumes that it was a suicide.

615
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,900
The media are also seeing it that way

616
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:59,750
It's likely that they would close the case like this.

617
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:03,990
But...

618
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:08,670
In Ms. Han Yoo Ra's laptop, some video clips of you and some phone conversation recordings were found.

619
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,010
I took care of the laptop but there was an evidence that she kept copies of those files somewhere.

620
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,280
Where are the copies, then?

621
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,570
When I checked the black box in the car, I saw that she put a USB in her clutch bag.

622
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,620
It's the clutch bag that she brought to the wedding.

623
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,510
Did you find it?

624
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:25,090
No. It wasn't in the cruise.

625
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:28,380
Get the CCTV data. 
Find out

626
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,110
who took it.

627
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,720
Yes, sir.

628
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,410
Hyung!

629
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:36,520
You can go now.

630
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,000
What?

631
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,460
You saw the news, right? Why is it my Cheon Song Yi's fault that Han Yoo Ra died?

632
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:47,910
I think I'm going to lose my mind.

633
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,420
Gather some reporters you know.

634
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,130
It might not be a suicide.

635
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:53,260
It could be an accidental death.

636
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:56,210
Bluntly saying, it could be a homicide.

637
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,990
There are a lot of similar cases abroad, too.

638
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,220
On a boat or a cruise they fabricated homicide 
 as suicide

639
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,670
It's being investigated now, so the truth will come out.

640
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:08,940
How can I believe that?

641
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,660
Let's eat first, eat.

642
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,240
Hey, here!

643
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,040
That's why...

644
00:44:22,810 --> 00:44:25,400
<i></i>

645
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:31,220
What's with these people?

646
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:36,690
<i></i>

647
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,770
Excuse me.

648
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,100
Which reporter are you?

649
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,650
I'm reporter Kim Hyuk Soo from the Dae Han Daily News.

650
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,080
I'm Na Jae Ho from the Yu Il Newspaper.

651
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,600
She's not coming out.

652
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,090
We've already rung the door.

653
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,350
It will be a real big news, 
if Cheon Song Yi's boyfriend or someone

654
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:07,350
comes in at a time like now.

655
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,100
Excuse me.

656
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,780
Don't just stand there. Come eat these fried dumplings

657
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,470
Aiyoo, it's fine. Come on.

658
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:15,590
No, it's fine...

659
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:17,790
She won't come out now.

660
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,050
Here.

661
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,100
Are you sure that she's inside?

662
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,090
We're sure. Her manager tried to bring her out but failed.

663
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:32,840
Then, she's-

664
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:37,600
Ms. Cheon Song Yi.

665
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:41,400
Wouldn't she be starving right now?

666
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:09,890
By the way,

667
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:13,010
is it true that Han Yoo Ra died because of you?

668
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:16,960
You saw at the hair salon.

669
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,670
Is she a type of person who would jump into the Han River because she doesn't want to do anything with me.

670
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:23,290
She would never do that.

671
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:30,490
When I saw her for the last time,

672
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,770
how much she bragged about

673
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:40,210
saying that she's getting married soon..

674
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,240
She was only 30 years old.

675
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,840
How in the earth did this happen?

676
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:56,340
I did nothing wrong, but

677
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:58,970
why does it bother me? Why do I feel sorry?

678
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:08,000
When did you last see her?

679
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,530
Last time when I saw her...

680
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:18,570
<i>[ Day of the incident at 11:30pm ]</i>

681
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,600
<i>Why can't I say anything?</i>

682
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:24,130
<i>What was that?</i>

683
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:31,600
<i>Bluntly saying, are we having an affair?</i>

684
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:35,480
<i>Han Yoo Ra.</i>

685
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,380
<i>Let's go in.</i>

686
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,340
<i>I think everyone who knows me</i>

687
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:50,400
<i>and knows you is here.</i>

688
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,920
<i>Count on me.</i>

689
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,090
<i>What would I say to those people.</i>

690
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:00,240
<i>I'm going to make a surprising announcement later.</i>

691
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:03,780
<i>If you hear that, you'd probably</i>

692
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,120
<i>be surprised, too.</i>

693
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:09,970
<i>Yoo Ra.</i>

694
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,470
<i>What?</i>

695
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,360
<i>How's your depression these days?</i>

696
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:19,290
<i>My depression is up to you, Oppa.</i>

697
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,880
<i>I stopped taking medicine a while ago.</i>

698
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,280
<i>You know I like you, right?</i>

699
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,630
<i>Take a good care of your health.</i>

700
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:34,100
<i>What is this? They </i>are<i> going out.</i>

701
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,790
<i>Jae Kyeong oppa's being so coy.</i>

702
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:39,210
<i>Oh my.</i>

703
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,450
<i>What are you doing?</i>

704
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:46,920
<i>By chance, were you eavesdropping?</i>

705
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,660
<i>A little?</i>

706
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,010
<i>I'm going to make announcement of our wedding.</i>

707
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:03,980
<i>But does it have to be Jae Kyeong Oppa?</i>

708
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,140
<i>What do you mean?</i>

709
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,980
<i>No, I mean...</i>

710
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,200
<i>Even though you're not my style, Unni,</i>

711
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:15,320
<i>I think men could think you quite attractive.</i>

712
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,450
<i>Why?</i>

713
00:49:17,450 --> 00:49:21,000
<i>Do you think I'm clinging onto Mr. Jae Kyeong, when he doesn't like me?</i>

714
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:23,620
<i>It kind of looked like that.</i>

715
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,120
<i>Don't be flip with me.</i>

716
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,360
<i>There's something you don't know.</i>

717
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,990
<i>The inside story why Oppa can't actively ask me 
to marry him.</i>

718
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,110
<i>What is that?</i>

719
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,760
<i>Do you think I'd tell you?</i>

720
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,190
<i>I mean, I'm not that curious either.</i>

721
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,980
<i>When I get married, I will immediately retire.</i>

722
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,700
<i>If I'm gone, you do all you want.</i>

723
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,420
<i>Don't worry.</i>

724
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,130
<i>Even now, I'm doing well enough.</i>

725
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,950
<i>Rude girl.</i>

726
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:00,310
<i>You won't let me win, not once.</i>

727
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,750
<i>Look who's talking.</i>

728
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,390



729
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:17,020
<i>Ah, why did she leave this behind?</i>

730
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:27,080
That was the last I saw of her.

731
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:32,730
I looked everywhere for her to to return her pouch, 
but couldn't find her.

732
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:37,990
After that, I got too drunk, so my memory is a bit...

733
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,650
Why?

734
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:47,270
Truthfully, something was really strange that day.

735
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:55,020
I'm pretty sure you watched enough.
 Let's just call it a day

736
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:58,490
Everything's been answered and accounted for.

737
00:50:58,550 --> 00:51:02,420
Huh?
Come on, give it a rest.

738
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,690
Who is this?

739
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:07,540
This person isn't on the list.

740
00:51:07,550 --> 00:51:09,800
Who?

741
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,970
Right here.

742
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:15,890
Who?

743
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,230
That's Cheon Song Yi.

744
00:51:17,230 --> 00:51:18,900
No.

745
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,020
Next to that.

746
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:33,050
That night I fell asleep on the boat,

747
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:35,450
I had a dream.

748
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:40,720
In my dream, you appeared.

749
00:51:41,890 --> 00:51:44,410
It was so clear that

750
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:47,620
I wondered whether it was really a dream.

751
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,790
It's true.

752
00:51:58,790 --> 00:52:01,190
I checked and this person isn't on the list.

753
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:06,170
He's not on the worker's list either...

754
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,150
But, what is this?

755
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:14,380
What the heck?

756
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:16,150
Where did that person go?

757
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:16,680
Exactly.

758
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:19,080
Ah, I'm getting goosebumps.

759
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,500
A ghost, isn't that a ghost?

760
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:27,260
Right. It must have been a ghost.

761
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:30,280
This video hasn't been tampered with, right?

762
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,760
Is it something like those water ghosts 
who were drowned to death?

763
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,290
This is freaky...

764
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,430
Aish...

765
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:44,210
But,

766
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:46,490
they both disappeared.

767
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:48,800
Now what?

768
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:51,550
When this man disappeared,

769
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:58,690
Ms. Cheon Song Yi also disappeared.

770
00:52:58,690 --> 00:53:01,430
This thing...

771
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:04,270
What could it be?

772
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:13,220
Because it was so vivid, I couldn't help
 but think it was real.

773
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:17,550
Perhaps,

774
00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:19,910
did you come that day?

775
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,020
That couldn't have happened.

776
00:53:24,050 --> 00:53:27,770
That's right, you couldn't have been there.

777
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:29,940
But I feel like

778
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,420
I definitely saw you there?

779
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,510
Then, what were you doing that day?

780
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:08,570
What the heck?

781
00:55:57,750 --> 00:56:02,830
<i>♫ In the past memories. ♫</i>

782
00:56:02,830 --> 00:56:11,370
<i>♫ In that pain, I call you. ♫</i>

783
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:16,340
<i>♫ You are are my destiny. ♫</i>

784
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:18,840
<i>♫ You ♫</i>

785
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:23,800
<i> ♫ You are my destiny. ♫</i>

786
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,190
<i>♫ You ♫</i>

787
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:29,100
Kiss?

788
00:56:29,150 --> 00:56:31,760
It's not like I didn't have a chance, but

789
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,340
I've never done it before.

790
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:35,950
Honestly, because I look like this,

791
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:38,270
there were a lot of temptations.

792
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,090
What is it that you need to talk with me?

793
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:48,020
Mr. Scholar,

794
00:56:50,430 --> 00:56:52,230
This , , ,

795
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:58,820
You've heard of Dan Won?

796
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,800
Dan Won Kim Heung Do.

797
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,640
He's the one who even drew a portrait 
of the eldest grandson of the king.

798
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:05,340
He's a painter,

799
00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:08,400
who's most popular in Han Yang these days.

800
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,480
Since it's my heart,

801
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:14,580
please accept it.

802
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:16,290
Also,

803
00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:21,940
this too...

804
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,420
The request of the most beautiful woman in Han Yang,

805
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,640
I can't reject that.

806
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:38,270
However, I have a confession to make before that.

807
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:43,910
Do you know where I'm from?

808
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:45,910
What?

809
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,420
I came from the star.

810
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:57,740
Therefore, will you be okay?

811
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:00,140
You won't, right?

812
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,900
Since we are people from different planets.

813
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:09,700
If you don't like me, you should've just said so.

814
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,800
How could you make up a nonsense like that?

815
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:15,630
Such an absurd lie...

816
00:58:15,650 --> 00:58:18,270
You're too much.

817
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:35,740
<i>Good morning!</i>

818
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:37,110
<i>You're dead!</i>

819
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,110
<i>Hey!</i>

820
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,100
<i>Oh, Father</i>

821
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,770
If it's really a suicide, then Han Yura...

822
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,270
She died because of our Song Yi?

823
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:44,700
<i>Then, what's going to happen to my Song Yi?</i>

824
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,530
<i>Look, it's her will.</i>

825
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:48,070
<i>It's game over.</i>

826
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:51,020
<i>Should I teach you how not to be hurt by people?</i>

827
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,920
<i>Don't give or accept anything. 
Also, don't expect anything.</i>

828
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:59,250
<i>Jae Kyeong Oppa?
 But, how do you know where I live?</i>

829
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:00,950
<i>Mr. Do Min Joon!</i>

830
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:04,750
<i>Mr. Do Min Joon, are you not there?</i>
