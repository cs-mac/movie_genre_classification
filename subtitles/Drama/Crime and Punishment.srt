1
00:01:09,264 --> 00:01:12,108
To all of you we have given what we could.

2
00:01:12,232 --> 00:01:18,268
Our fund of knowledge, of discipline, all the ideals that we hold precious.

3
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:21,738
We have nothing more to give you
than our prayers and hopes.

4
00:01:21,739 --> 00:01:27,469
The future is yours. May you take it into your
strong young hands with a high purpose.

5
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:32,329
Bend it to your will. Shape it in brave
and shining destiny.

6
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:34,521
And now...

7
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:39,814
It is my great pleasure to confer
our academic degree with honor...

8
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:42,922
on the most distinguished student of this class.

9
00:01:42,923 --> 00:01:45,951
Roderick Raskolnikov.

10
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:58,192
In the history of our Institution...

11
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:02,480
there have been few young men who
compared with him in mental brilliance.

12
00:02:02,481 --> 00:02:06,534
And few for whom the future held greater promise.

13
00:02:06,535 --> 00:02:10,757
I extend my congratulations to his mother
and to his sister...

14
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,115
to whom the present moment is
the reward for years of sacrifice.

15
00:02:16,116 --> 00:02:19,784
I've spoken for the University.
Now I want to speak for myself.

16
00:02:19,785 --> 00:02:21,838
I'm proud to have had you as one of us.

17
00:02:21,839 --> 00:02:26,772
Sad that you're leaving.
Good luck.

18
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,241
God bless you.

19
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:41,000
There have been few who compared with mental brilliance.
And few for whom the future held greater promise.

20
00:02:41,092 --> 00:02:42,858
Tony !
Mother, help !

21
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:45,862
Here, here. Wait a minute.

22
00:02:45,863 --> 00:02:49,169
Oh, Dimitri. Have you met my sister Antonia ?

23
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,906
Informally.
Mother, this is Dimitri.

24
00:02:51,907 --> 00:02:55,484
My son has mentioned you in every letter.
He tells me you're his best friend.

25
00:02:55,485 --> 00:02:57,611
Don't believe him. He's no friend of mine.

26
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,612
Shares rooms with me for years
and never tells me about his sister.

27
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:02,846
I did tell you.
But not enough.

28
00:03:02,847 --> 00:03:05,795
How would I know looking at you
that she was so beautiful ?

29
00:03:05,796 --> 00:03:11,067
Here's your chance, Tony. No brains, not much money,
but enough. So work fast.

30
00:03:12,876 --> 00:03:15,719
Oh, Roderick. I'm so happy.

31
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,852
This watch was your father's.

32
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:27,373
He told me to give it to you on this day.

33
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:29,910
How proud he'd have been.

34
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,851
If only he could have lived
to give it to you himself.

35
00:04:49,052 --> 00:04:53,488
Good afternoon.
We haven't seen much of you these past two days.

36
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:57,756
Have you been training or only fasting ?
I've been contemplating life.

37
00:04:57,757 --> 00:04:59,705
You'd better contemplate the rent.

38
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:02,874
I haven't had a penny out of you in 6 months.
How much longer do you expect me to wait ?

39
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:07,261
Can you stand the strain another half hour ?
Oh, you're going to pay me in half an hour ?

40
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:11,192
And if it's not being too personal, just
how are you going to raise the money ?

41
00:05:11,193 --> 00:05:12,813
I'm going to rob a bank.

42
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:15,957
You think you're funny ? I don't.
Pack up your things and get out of here.

43
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:20,029
Leave you ? I couldn't do that.
I'm too attached to you.

44
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,902
You pay tonight or I'll take measures.
You're a disgrace to my house.

45
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:30,997
Some day, they'll put a sign on it telling the world that
I Raskolnikov once had the privilege of starving here

46
00:05:43,358 --> 00:05:45,659
Dimitri !
Roderick !

47
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,324
There's something I have to show you.
Have you seen this ?

48
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:53,566
There's an article called "Sidelights on Crime"
and it contains some of the theories you're always talking about.

49
00:05:53,567 --> 00:05:56,067
It's great. It'll upset all that old-fashioned nonsense.

50
00:05:56,154 --> 00:05:58,054
You must read it.

51
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,530
Not bad.

52
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:02,349
Have you read this before ?

53
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,236
Not since I wrote it.

54
00:06:04,237 --> 00:06:06,872
I should have known nobody but you
could have written this article.

55
00:06:06,951 --> 00:06:08,600
Have you seen the review on it ?

56
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:13,426
Doesn't it make you feel good ?
As a matter of fact it's a bit...

57
00:06:13,427 --> 00:06:15,862
uncomfortable.

58
00:06:16,154 --> 00:06:17,972
I'm getting more of a thrill out of this than you are.

59
00:06:17,973 --> 00:06:21,755
What's the matter ? Didn't you get paid for this article ?
I did. And the money came in handy.

60
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,247
Antonia lost a position and I sent it home.

61
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:29,937
Just like you. The first money you've earned in years.
I had to. Antonia and mother will be here next week.

62
00:06:30,529 --> 00:06:31,529
Don't be offended. If they're coming,
you can't receive them the way you're living.

63
00:06:34,613 --> 00:06:37,262
They'll be terribly upset.
You've got to let me lend you some money.

64
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:40,816
I'm just an ordinary sort of fellow.
But you a genius.

65
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,929
Some day when you're famous I'll be proud that I helped.

66
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:45,095
I don't want help from you or anybody.

67
00:06:45,096 --> 00:06:49,771
It's nearly 7. I have some important business to attend to.
See you some other time.

68
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,473
Oh, it's you.

69
00:07:24,966 --> 00:07:28,265
Who's this ? Another of your gentlemen friends ?

70
00:07:28,266 --> 00:07:31,701
No.
What have you got this time ?

71
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:36,706
Where did you steal this ?

72
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,804
You say that about everything I bring here.

73
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,455
Why shouldn't I ? Look who brings them.

74
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:44,253
It's been in our family a long time.

75
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,479
What do you want for this ?

76
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,270
It's inlaid with mother of pearl and the stones are garnets.

77
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,272
Garnets, eh ?

78
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,631
It's worth at least 100 rubles.
I thought I could get 20 for it.

79
00:07:56,818 --> 00:07:59,887
So it's been in your family a long time.

80
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:03,092
If you look on the first page you will see
my name written down when I was born.

81
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:06,359
And my little brother and sister marked down there too.

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,261
How long since you've looked inside of it ?

83
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:13,102
I read it every night.
You read the bibel every night ?

84
00:08:13,103 --> 00:08:15,322
You oughtn't to be allowed to touch it.

85
00:08:15,324 --> 00:08:17,325
I'll give you 8 rubles for it.

86
00:08:17,326 --> 00:08:19,762
I'll take the 8 rubles.
Wait a minute.

87
00:08:19,763 --> 00:08:22,745
The inlay is coming loose.
There's another stone missing.

88
00:08:22,746 --> 00:08:25,726
I'll give you 6, take it or leave it.
What have you got ?

89
00:08:25,727 --> 00:08:28,030
A watch.
I'll take the 6.

90
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:32,537
Unless you give me, the easier will it be
for me to pay you back, I suppose.

91
00:08:32,538 --> 00:08:37,948
But this is only 1. You said 6 rubles.
That's right. 6.

92
00:08:37,949 --> 00:08:42,751
There's 6 month's interest on your shawl.
10% a month on 8 rubles makes 2.40.

93
00:08:42,752 --> 00:08:46,565
And you owe me 2 month's interest
on your silver necklace and your buckles.

94
00:08:46,966 --> 00:08:50,608
That makes 5 rubles. 5 from 6 leaves 1.
Is that clear ?

95
00:08:50,609 --> 00:08:53,133
Or do you expect me to be in business for love ?

96
00:08:53,134 --> 00:08:56,327
Well, what are you waiting for ?
Do you want your Bible back ?

97
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:59,328
No.

98
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:03,488
Come along then. Get out.
Don't hang around here all day.

99
00:09:07,645 --> 00:09:12,182
Common little gutter snipe.
Let me see your watch.

100
00:09:25,783 --> 00:09:28,494
To my son, we wear it in honor.

101
00:09:28,495 --> 00:09:32,192
I want 50 rubles on it.

102
00:09:32,193 --> 00:09:34,407
I'll give you 10.

103
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:39,201
You can't do that to me.

104
00:09:39,202 --> 00:09:45,824
Give me the 10 and let me get out of here before...

105
00:09:45,825 --> 00:09:48,469
Before what ?
Before you eat me up ?

106
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,995
What are you doing ?

107
00:09:58,996 --> 00:10:02,296
The ruble. It dropped out of my hand
when she pushed me out of the door.

108
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:05,967
Somebody ought to push her straight into the next world.
I've got to find it.

109
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:34,207
What use is that money to her ?
It could save 100 lives like yours and mine.

110
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,520
It's plain arithmetic.
You could use some of her money, couldn't you ?

111
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:43,112
What will you do if you don't find the ruble ?
She ought to be stamped out.

112
00:10:43,113 --> 00:10:45,296
You shouldn't say things like that.

113
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:50,484
Black beetle squatting up there on her money bags.

114
00:10:50,485 --> 00:10:55,491
It would be a service to humanity.
A crime would be a strange way of serving humanity.

115
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,050
Here it is. I found it.

116
00:11:07,143 --> 00:11:10,430
I don't know what I would have done without it.

117
00:11:10,431 --> 00:11:13,534
Why is it all women weep when they are happy ?

118
00:11:14,735 --> 00:11:17,592
My little brother and sister haven't
had a thing to eat all day.

119
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,634
Are you the only one to look after them ?
No, there's father.

120
00:11:20,635 --> 00:11:22,683
Only he drinks to forget his troubles.

121
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:25,224
The more he drinks, the more mother scolds.

122
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:30,438
The more she scolds, the more he drinks.
Between the two there's hardly any time left for us.

123
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,894
I forgot there is justness and kindness in the world.
Thank you.

124
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:38,124
I forgot there was still some beauty in it.

125
00:11:47,442 --> 00:11:50,268
Now let me tie this around your wrist
so that you can't lose it.

126
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:53,542
The money's in there.
Now when you get home...

127
00:11:53,543 --> 00:11:56,065
don't let father see what you've got. Understand ?

128
00:11:56,297 --> 00:11:59,608
Give it to mother. Wait a minute.
Let me make it pretty.

129
00:12:07,531 --> 00:12:11,345
Give this to your sister. Don't tell her who gave it to you.

130
00:12:31,323 --> 00:12:32,971
Move along.

131
00:12:33,182 --> 00:12:35,530
Come on. Move along.

132
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:46,321
Excuse me.
What did you say ?

133
00:12:46,322 --> 00:12:50,793
I said excuse me.
Say it again and say it loud.

134
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:52,494
Excuse me !

135
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:56,721
Say it loud !

136
00:13:16,552 --> 00:13:20,999
How much higher do I have to climb ?
One more flight. The last door on top.

137
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,355
The place you brought me to. I must say.

138
00:13:23,356 --> 00:13:28,147
I didn't expect your son to be living in a palace
but you didn't tell me he was living in a place like this.

139
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:30,785
We didn't know. He should have written us the truth.

140
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,722
Roderick.

141
00:13:40,798 --> 00:13:44,033
It's awful finding you in a place like this.
Tony !

142
00:13:47,737 --> 00:13:50,260
Roderick, this is our friend, Mr. Lushin.

143
00:13:50,261 --> 00:13:52,148
My son.
How do you do, sir ?

144
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,142
Mr. Lushin is a very important man.

145
00:13:55,806 --> 00:13:58,699
I'm honoured.
He holds two government positions.

146
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,151
Two ?
I'm doubly honoured.

147
00:14:01,152 --> 00:14:06,514
I can't tell you how kind and helpful he's been to us.
After Antonia lost her position we've been in terrible trouble.

148
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:09,802
Mother. Please don't let's talk about it now.
What trouble ?

149
00:14:09,803 --> 00:14:11,480
She wouldn't let me write.

150
00:14:11,481 --> 00:14:14,927
The husband of the woman she worked for
turned out to be a most horrible person.

151
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:18,663
I had to leave because I wasn't obliging.
Let's not go over that again, mother.

152
00:14:18,664 --> 00:14:20,751
Tell him about the revolver.
What revolver ?

153
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:23,875
She had to keep it under her pillow at night
to protect herself from him.

154
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:26,917
And his wife found out and lied about me after I left.

155
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,586
You can imagine how easy it was
to find a position after that.

156
00:14:29,587 --> 00:14:32,027
It's lucky Mr. Lushin came along to help us.

157
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:39,328
Shall I tell your brother now ?
Why not ? He'll have to know some time.

158
00:14:39,929 --> 00:14:42,217
I know this will be a great surprise to you, Roderick.

159
00:14:42,218 --> 00:14:45,976
Mr. Lushin and your sister are engaged to be married.
Show him your ring, Antonia.

160
00:14:45,977 --> 00:14:50,398
Tony engaged ?
Well, sir, is that all you have to say ?

161
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,012
I want to understand this clearly.
What is there to understand ?

162
00:14:54,013 --> 00:15:00,029
Mr. Lushin has honoured me by asking me to become his wife.
I have accepted because I love him.

163
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:04,508
Madame, let me complimento you on your son's manners.
Please don't be offended.

164
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,518
Our happiness means everything to him.

165
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,516
Roderick, I think you ought to know that Mr. Lushin is marrying
your sister without asking for any dowery at all.

166
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:17,587
I may say I have very advanced ideas on the subject of marriage.

167
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:22,184
Indeed.
I prefer a girl like you sister who has experienced poverty.

168
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:25,519
I bilieve a wife should always look up to her husband as her benefactor.

169
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,386
And he is the best news of all, Roderick.

170
00:15:28,387 --> 00:15:34,598
Mr. Lushin has agreed to employ you as his private secretary.
I'm afraid you're stating things a little too definitely.

171
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:38,354
I didn't absolutely agree to employ your son.
But Mr. Lushin, you did.

172
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,188
You promised me. It was quite definite.
No. I did not promise.

173
00:15:42,189 --> 00:15:44,457
How can you say that ?
You did.

174
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:47,470
For the sake of calrifying our future relationship...

175
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:51,711
please understand that I prefer not to be contradicted.

176
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:59,750
Excuse me for coming to your room like this.

177
00:16:01,051 --> 00:16:03,779
I just had to thank you for the money you gave us.

178
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:08,835
I would have come sooner.
Only I didn't know where you lived, or even your name.

179
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:12,125
Then I remembered the pawnbroker...

180
00:16:12,219 --> 00:16:14,097
could tell from her books.

181
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:18,256
Excuse me. I had to thank him.

182
00:16:18,257 --> 00:16:22,731
I'd better go now.
Not until you meet my mother and sister.

183
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,868
Mother... What's your name ?
Sonya.

184
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:27,805
Sonya, a friend of mine.

185
00:16:27,806 --> 00:16:30,144
How do you do ?
How do you do ?

186
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:32,359
My sister Antonya.

187
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:36,238
I don't think you should be asked to meet a person
who's a nameless aquaintance of your brother's.

188
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,240
Which one of your two government positions permits you to insult her ?

189
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:50,962
I did it to protect the honor of the woman
I'm going to make my wife.

190
00:16:50,963 --> 00:16:53,679
Did you say honor ? If she marries you
she doesn't know what the word means.

191
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:56,537
What are you saying ?
Don't get excited, mother.

192
00:16:56,538 --> 00:16:59,206
I know you didn't mean it. You're upset.
I forbid you to speak to him.

193
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:02,487
I'm sorry, Mr. Lushin. I expected a different sort of welcome for you.

194
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:05,638
I shall not hold this against you, Antonya.
But you are never to see your brother again.

195
00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,743
Do you understand ? Come !

196
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:15,774
Tony, don't go with him.
Leave me alone. I do what I please.

197
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:22,533
Mother, you must stop her. Take her home with you at once.

198
00:17:22,534 --> 00:17:26,253
But darling, we have nowhere to go.
Mr. Lushin promised to pay our hotel bills after we got here.

199
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:33,852
You mean without his help you have nowhere to sleep tonight ?

200
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:36,960
Roderick, don't you see ? There's no use fighting the will of heaven.

201
00:17:36,961 --> 00:17:40,067
All I can see is my sister selling herself for a night's lodging.

202
00:17:40,068 --> 00:17:42,574
Don't make this seem worse than it is.
She's just doing this for you.

203
00:17:42,575 --> 00:17:47,118
I won't have it. This is only a question of money.
Are you going to let him buy Antonya's future ?

204
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,688
And yours and mine ?

205
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:54,789
We'll talk this over again in the morning.
I'm sure you'll feel differently about it then.

206
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:58,984
Money !

207
00:18:03,001 --> 00:18:04,829
Money.

208
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:08,064
Money. Money !

209
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:10,788
Money. Money. Money. Money !

210
00:18:51,478 --> 00:18:55,176
Why are you tying all those knots for ?

211
00:18:55,277 --> 00:18:58,187
You'll find out. Just wait.

212
00:18:58,188 --> 00:19:02,428
You've studied these things. You know better than
anyone else that a crime is always found out.

213
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:09,179
I've studied these things.
They won't find me out. I won't make mistakes.

214
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:12,394
The ideals that we hold precious.

215
00:19:12,395 --> 00:19:18,282
The future is yours.
Take it into your strong young hands...

216
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:22,912
with a high purpose.
I'll take it into my strong young hands.

217
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,357
Coward !

218
00:19:24,358 --> 00:19:26,851
Antonya's marrying him for your sake.

219
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:29,000
You won't have to marry him for my sake.

220
00:19:29,247 --> 00:19:32,666
Move along. Move along !
Get out of my way.

221
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,256
What do you want ? It's after hours.

222
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:26,360
It's me. Don't you remember ?

223
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:32,274
I have a very valuable cigarette case.
Nice hour this to come around with your rubbish.

224
00:20:32,275 --> 00:20:35,083
Come in.

225
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:43,137
Let's see this valuable cigarette case of yours.

226
00:20:46,538 --> 00:20:49,541
What's it made of ? Lead ?
Gold.

227
00:20:51,642 --> 00:20:55,273
What's the idea of making so many knots ?

228
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:03,201
It must be inlaid with diamonds the way you tied it.

229
00:22:09,002 --> 00:21:13,016
Come on, you ald hag. I need some money tonight.
Nobody home.

230
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:15,759
That's strange. She never goes out.

231
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,942
It's latched on the inside.

232
00:22:23,943 --> 00:22:28,806
There must be somebody home.
She couldn't go out and leave the door latched on the inside.

233
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:32,329
Something queer about this. Let's go down and get the porter.

234
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:03,559
All right, gentlemen. We'll see. We'll see.

235
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,778
It was latched a moment ago.

236
00:23:34,085 --> 00:23:37,827
Help ! Murder ! Police ! Police !

237
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:47,811
Good evening.
Good evening.

238
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:11,160
Looking for something ?

239
00:24:11,161 --> 00:24:14,602
Some of your old newspapers.
I haven't seen a paper for days.

240
00:25:04,574 --> 00:25:07,455
Company to see you.

241
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,554
I don't want to see anybody.

242
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:14,348
You've been sleeping with your gloves on.

243
00:25:15,249 --> 00:25:17,352
There's a policeman here for you.

244
00:25:17,353 --> 00:25:19,648
Here he is, officer.

245
00:25:28,749 --> 00:25:30,688
Are you the writer Raskolnikov ?

246
00:25:30,689 --> 00:25:34,140
Yes.
Come with me. You're wanted at headquarters.

247
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,332
Why ?
You'll find out when you get there. Hurry up.

248
00:25:37,334 --> 00:25:38,755
We haven't all day.

249
00:25:41,929 --> 00:25:44,436
Excuse me.

250
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,261
This door.

251
00:25:51,308 --> 00:25:54,476
What I want to know is who says they
were drunk in my café and fighting.

252
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:57,102
As far as I can judge, every neighbor did in the radius of a mile.

253
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:59,085
What do you want us to do ? Talk in whispers ?

254
00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:03,324
It's the most refined place in town.
You ought to know. You were there last week.

255
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:07,541
Please remember madame, I was there in my official capacity.

256
00:26:08,642 --> 00:26:12,567
What do you want ?
Why have I been brought here ?

257
00:26:12,568 --> 00:26:15,430
No hurry. When your turn comes we'll give you plenty of time.

258
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:17,624
If there was a disturbance you should have
called the person who caused it.

259
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:23,514
Well if you're all officers, we won't mention any names,
but in comes your fine captain drink as a pig...

260
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,300
and orders 3 bottles of champagne...

261
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:29,773
then he lifts up one leg like this and brings it down
on my piano and starts to play it with his boot.

262
00:26:29,774 --> 00:26:34,841
And when I asked him, please, not to break my piano
he slaps me in the face.

263
00:26:34,842 --> 00:26:38,448
Then he slaps Louise, he slaps Mathilda, all of my entertainers.

264
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:41,642
And then he chases me all over the house.

265
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:43,966
Go sit over there and cool off.

266
00:26:44,596 --> 00:26:47,899
What's your name ?
Raskolnikov.

267
00:26:54,808 --> 00:26:57,702
Raskolnikov.

268
00:26:58,903 --> 00:27:02,901
You owe your lanlady 30 rubles and
you refuse to vacate the premises.

269
00:27:04,751 --> 00:27:08,410
Is that why I am here ?

270
00:27:10,387 --> 00:27:13,467
Are you going to pay and get out peacefully
or are we going to have to throw you out ?

271
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,749
I'll pay her tomorrow.

272
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,142
The rent. You hear ? It's a rent !

273
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:27,035
30 rubles ?
Stop that shouting. Do you realize where you are ?

274
00:27:27,036 --> 00:27:29,581
Do you realize where you are ?

275
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,026
See that sign ? No smoking !

276
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,808
What are you doing with that thing in your face ?

277
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:37,048
I don't know anything about it !

278
00:27:37,049 --> 00:27:40,237
I don't know anything about it.
Let me go ! Let me go !

279
00:27:43,738 --> 00:27:46,380
What's going on here ?

280
00:27:54,781 --> 00:27:56,924
Is this the man that tried to sell the earrings ?

281
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:59,398
Yes, sir. We found him working in an empty flat
under the old pawnbroker's.

282
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,768
Your honor, I know nothing, nothing.

283
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:05,416
Don't have no trouble with him, sir.
Get him to talk. He knows who committed the murder.

284
00:28:07,617 --> 00:28:10,587
Oh, my gracious !
He's fainted.

285
00:28:18,246 --> 00:28:21,836
I'm sorry. The heat.

286
00:28:31,357 --> 00:28:35,850
Who's that ?
He's a writer, sir. His name is... Just one moment.

287
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:44,002
Raskolnikov, sir.
Raskolnikov ? That's just tha man I want to see.

288
00:28:44,003 --> 00:28:49,022
Hey ! Wait a minute.

289
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:58,070
This is an unexpected pleasure.

290
00:28:58,071 --> 00:29:00,764
Porfiry is my name. Chief Inspector.

291
00:29:00,765 --> 00:29:03,259
You know what I did imediately after I read your article ?

292
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,306
I wrote to the editor of Current Review to find out
the name of the genius who was the author.

293
00:29:08,307 --> 00:29:11,148
I thought I knew something about crime.

294
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:15,341
But I swear you put me and my staff in the kindergarten class.

295
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:18,439
Come into my office. You'll find it a little cooler there.

296
00:29:18,449 --> 00:29:21,899
I'd like to have your help in a brand new murder case.

297
00:29:22,196 --> 00:29:24,583
We'll give you a chance to see how the...

298
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:28,347
blundering police work.

299
00:29:29,665 --> 00:29:32,266
What do you mean the policeman took him away ?
Have they arrested him ?

300
00:29:32,267 --> 00:29:36,260
What for ?
The policeman came and took him away.

301
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,554
Come in. Sit down.

302
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,507
An old pawnbroker was killed last night.
A well-known character by the name of Leona.

303
00:29:56,164 --> 00:29:58,894
Bring the prisoner in.
Yes, sir.

304
00:29:45,350 --> 00:30:05,434
I consider myself very fortunate to have you here.

305
00:30:05,435 --> 00:30:08,083
You see, I have a feeling you have a...

306
00:30:08,084 --> 00:30:10,579
an instinctive understanding of criminal types....

307
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:13,581
that might be more valuable than all the years of my experience.

308
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:20,479
You can leave us. Sit down.

309
00:30:22,712 --> 00:30:26,074
An obvious criminal type in my opinion.
What do you think ?

310
00:30:26,075 --> 00:30:30,275
You mean to say that you can say by looking
at a man if he is capable of crime ?

311
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:31,837
In most cases yes.

312
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:35,506
The born criminal has certain facial characteristics
that brand him imediately.

313
00:30:35,507 --> 00:30:39,275
The difficult case is a normal person who is driven to crime
through passion or need.

314
00:30:39,276 --> 00:30:42,525
Such a man however gives himself up in the end through fear.

315
00:30:42,526 --> 00:30:44,866
Fear of the law or of God.

316
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,929
And your ability to inspire fear must be a powerful weapon.

317
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,909
Very. Half the time it drives a man to us
saving us the bother of going after him.

318
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:57,955
And then, I wouldn't confess this openly, but from
one criminologist to another...

319
00:30:57,956 --> 00:31:03,448
we take credit in being inhumanly skillful.
So you were working in the flat underneath the pawnbroker's, uh ?

320
00:31:03,449 --> 00:31:06,383
Yes, your honor.
What time last night did you finish work ?

321
00:31:06,384 --> 00:31:09,751
About 7 o'clock, your honor.
Where did you go after you left work ?

322
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,397
I just went to a place to get a drink.

323
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:15,021
How long did you stay there ?
A few hours.

324
00:31:15,022 --> 00:31:18,297
What time did you get home ?
By midnight.

325
00:31:18,298 --> 00:31:20,798
You had blood on your clothes
when you got home last night, didn't you ?

326
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,791
Yes, your honor.
How did it get there ?

327
00:31:22,792 --> 00:31:28,570
We were feeling happy and I banged
on the table with my glass, like this...

328
00:31:28,571 --> 00:31:32,361
and it broke and it cut my hand.
What did you do when you got home ?

329
00:31:32,362 --> 00:31:35,666
I wanted to go to sleep, your honor, but...

330
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,466
my wife started to make a lot of noise...

331
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:41,370
screaming and scolding... so I beat her.

332
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:44,282
You beat your wife often ?

333
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:46,732
Not often.

334
00:31:46,733 --> 00:31:48,743
About once a week.

335
00:31:50,092 --> 00:31:53,850
This must be one of the extraordinary men you describe in your article.

336
00:31:56,445 --> 00:32:01,082
I was amused how you classify all your men
into the ordinary and the extraordinary.

337
00:32:01,083 --> 00:32:07,762
Ordinary men, you say, must obey the law because
they are ordinary.

338
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:13,025
But extraordinary men have the right to transgress the law
because they're extraordinary, isn't that right ?

339
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:18,763
Not exactly. I maintain such a man should not
be judged by ordinary standards.

340
00:32:18,764 --> 00:32:20,550
For example, Napoleon.

341
00:32:20,551 --> 00:32:23,243
A man may wipe out millions of lives...

342
00:32:23,244 --> 00:32:25,995
but if he builds an empire, nobody condemns him.

343
00:32:26,762 --> 00:32:32,020
Oh, come now my friend. I doubt very much
that Napoleon murdered this pawnbroker.

344
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:36,782
I'm glad my theories furnish you with the chance to be witty.

345
00:32:36,783 --> 00:32:38,563
Don't be so touchy.

346
00:32:38,564 --> 00:32:41,264
You see, I'm a practical man, a policeman.

347
00:32:41,265 --> 00:32:44,329
I'm just wondering what instructions to give my men.

348
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:48,271
To help them in discriminating between the great men in the herd.

349
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:53,031
It would make it a lot simpler to us if
they were to have some distinguishing mark.

350
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:58,893
A medal or ribbon. Or a resemblence to Napoleon.

351
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,249
Like yourself. for instance.

352
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:17,934
At what time did you get to work this morning ?
7 o'clock, your honor.

353
00:33:17,935 --> 00:33:21,890
But you left your work imediately afterwards
and at 8 o'clock you tried to sell a pair of gold earrings.

354
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,917
Yes, sir.
Where did you get those earrings ?

355
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:26,669
I found them.
Exactly where did you find them ?

356
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,266
Behind the door of the empty flat where I was working.

357
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:33,346
Ever see this before ?
It's a poker, but...

358
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:35,073
You know it's a poker.

359
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:45,244
Have you ever seen this before ?
No, sir.

360
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:46,578
Look at me.

361
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:50,441
You tied this package tightly pretending there
was something in it you wanted to pawn.

362
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:54,984
While she was bending over trying to untie the knots
you picked up a poker and srtiked her over the head.

363
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:58,077
Confess that you killed her !
Where's the rest of her property ?

364
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:03,022
Please help me. Tell him I know nothing about it.

365
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,055
Take him away !

366
00:34:08,922 --> 00:34:13,312
The more I see of humanity the more
I marvel at its infinite variety.

367
00:34:13,313 --> 00:34:18,393
The difference between a man and a monkey isn't
as great as the difference between one man and another.

368
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:23,800
You're right, my friend. One man of genius
is worth a million like him.

369
00:34:23,801 --> 00:34:30,017
How did you know a poker was used ?
The bungler wiped the blood off the weapon on the victim's apron.

370
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:35,026
From the crease in the cloth and the bloodstains we
know it was a poker.

371
00:34:36,613 --> 00:34:39,727
What do you think ? You're the jury.

372
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:41,697
Is he guilty or not guilty ?

373
00:34:41,698 --> 00:34:45,479
Not guilty.
Not guilty ?

374
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,822
What makes you think so ?

375
00:34:47,972 --> 00:34:50,191
He doesn't look guilty to me.

376
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:54,096
Then in your opinion this man is innocent.
In my opinion you have no case.

377
00:34:54,097 --> 00:34:55,875
Enough to send him to the gallows.

378
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:59,226
You're not going to send an innocent man to the gallows.
Why not ?

379
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:01,540
To be very honest, I want to keep my record clear.

380
00:35:02,086 --> 00:35:06,303
What about your conscience afterwards ?
Why should I bother with a conscience ?

381
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,071
Let the murderer suffer from his conscience.

382
00:35:11,072 --> 00:35:14,709
The real murderer, that is, if this man is innocent.
But I don't agree with you.

383
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,052
The criminal was just like the man we got.
A stupid coward.

384
00:35:18,053 --> 00:35:21,346
If he weren't in a panic he would
have found the old woman's money.

385
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:24,392
1500 rubles tucked snugly away neatly in a matress.

386
00:35:24,393 --> 00:35:26,815
The first place a competent and brainy criminal would have looked.

387
00:35:26,816 --> 00:35:30,617
Instead he picks up a lot of junk that's no use to him.
Where is he going to unload it ?

388
00:35:30,618 --> 00:35:34,405
After all, professor, this is your problem, not mine.

389
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,644
You promised to show me some of your blundering police methods.

390
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:43,066
And you certainly have.

391
00:35:43,067 --> 00:35:46,198
Sorry I can't give more asistance.

392
00:35:46,779 --> 00:35:49,074
Good luck.
Thanks.

393
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:52,089
Why did you call me Professor ?
Because...

394
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,463
you profess to know something about crime.

395
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:11,183
Roderick. What are you here for ?
I didn't know what to think when I heard they arrested you.

396
00:36:11,184 --> 00:36:15,118
I'll tell you all about it some other time.
You've got to let me have some money. Now is your chance.

397
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,313
Why, of course.
30 rubles. Not a penny more, not a penny less.

398
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:23,952
My mother and sister arrived.
They did ? Where are they ? When can I see them ?

399
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:26,398
Tonight I'll wait for you at 8 o'clock.

400
00:37:13,882 --> 00:37:16,239
Move along. What are you doing here ?

401
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,332
Merely admiring myself. I am an author.

402
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:25,160
You look it. Move on.

403
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:28,739
You're not going to push me away again.

404
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:32,793
And what's more, I'm going in to see the editor.

405
00:37:38,015 --> 00:37:39,958
I want to see the editor.

406
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:43,624
You'll have to write for an appointment. The editor
is a very important man.

407
00:37:43,625 --> 00:37:47,402
So am I.
Just a minute, have you got an appointment ? Where do you think you're going ?

408
00:37:47,403 --> 00:37:49,698
To see the editor.
You'd better get out before you're thrown out !

409
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:52,231
I want to see the editor !

410
00:37:52,232 --> 00:37:56,650
What's all the rumpus ?
Someone giving birth to an idea ?

411
00:37:56,651 --> 00:38:00,936
My name is Raskolnikov.
He was trying to rush right in without an appointment.

412
00:38:01,929 --> 00:38:05,919
Well. Take a good look at him. Let him rush in any time he feels like it.

413
00:38:07,058 --> 00:38:08,785
Come in, sir.

414
00:38:13,241 --> 00:38:15,562
You know what I was doing last night ?

415
00:38:15,563 --> 00:38:18,130
Going over the letters that came in on your article.

416
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:20,954
Some of them are from the most important people in the country.

417
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:24,779
The Chief Inspector of Police of our own city
wanted to know who wrote it.

418
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,743
I just left him.
Really ?

419
00:38:26,744 --> 00:38:28,669
He asked me to help him in a case.

420
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,677
Have a cigar.
No, thanks.

421
00:38:30,678 --> 00:38:32,157
Some Port then.
Thanks.

422
00:38:32,158 --> 00:38:35,035
When do we get your next article ?
There won't be any next one.

423
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:40,701
What do you mean ? You can't stop now.
The editor of the National Weekly wants me to do a series.

424
00:38:40,702 --> 00:38:45,825
That pirate. Why doesn't he develop his own writers
instead of stealing mine ? You're my discovery.

425
00:38:45,826 --> 00:38:51,306
You didn't think enough of your discovery to put his name on the article.
I'll put your name on the cover if you wish.

426
00:38:51,307 --> 00:38:56,554
The pirate is willing to put my name on a check for 750 rubles.

427
00:38:56,555 --> 00:39:00,304
I'll put it on a check for 1.000.
How's that ?

428
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:04,727
Or perhaps you prefer the cash ?
I'll get it for you.

429
00:39:04,728 --> 00:39:07,909
I'm sorry you didn't get the idea of dropping in sooner.

430
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:31,085
Don't be astonished if you see a peculiar
animal in a few moments.

431
00:39:31,086 --> 00:39:34,443
It answers by the name of Lushin.
Who is Mr. Lushin ?

432
00:39:34,444 --> 00:39:37,050
He's two government officials.

433
00:39:37,061 --> 00:39:40,618
And I'm going to squat them both to the sidewalk.

434
00:39:40,762 --> 00:39:43,676
Yes, sir. You're expected.
Go right up.

435
00:39:44,784 --> 00:39:48,825
Thank you.
Look here, Roderick. I don't like mysteries. Tell me what's happened.

436
00:39:48,826 --> 00:39:53,640
I've never seen you fling money like this before.
You've got a new personality, to say nothing of a new pose.

437
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,755
Only this morning you were borrowing 30 rubles from me.

438
00:39:55,756 --> 00:39:59,228
Yes, sir, and I'm paying them back now.
What's happened to you ?

439
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:03,000
I've learned how not to be afraid.
How did you do that ?

440
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:04,750
What difference does it make ?

441
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,170
If you've discovered a formula for killing fear overnight
you oughtn't to keep it to yourself.

442
00:40:08,171 --> 00:40:10,716
Publish it. You'll become a benefactor to humanity.

443
00:40:10,717 --> 00:40:13,640
The devil with humanity.

444
00:40:16,827 --> 00:40:18,748
Hello, mother.

445
00:40:22,649 --> 00:40:24,915
You've got a new suit on Roderick.

446
00:40:26,316 --> 00:40:29,001
How splendid you look.

447
00:40:29,002 --> 00:40:31,441
Dimitri.

448
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:35,014
Haw are you ? We've been talking about you
and wondering when we'd see you.

449
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,992
For me ? Thank you.

450
00:40:40,893 --> 00:40:44,124
Antonya ! See who's here.

451
00:40:45,425 --> 00:40:48,031
Antonya, I thought I'd bring you some flowers.

452
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:51,046
Thank you. I'm so happy to see you again.

453
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:57,982
Mr. Lushin, may I apologize for what happened the last time ?

454
00:40:57,983 --> 00:41:00,221
Of course I'll accept your apology if you're very sorry.

455
00:41:00,222 --> 00:41:03,704
I'm very sorry. I'm miserable.

456
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:07,122
I want to make a point of the fact that I am
not one to be unforgiving.

457
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:10,229
Then may I talk to my sister again ?
Stop your clowning, Roderick !

458
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,199
You know he didn't mean that seriously, did you ?

459
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:14,439
No.
Thank you. You're very generous.

460
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,613
Dimitri, this is Mr. Lushin, my
sister's fiancée.

461
00:41:17,614 --> 00:41:21,695
Your sister's what ?
Fiancée. You know, it's what you get married to.

462
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:26,317
Mr. Lushin isn't a day over 50. All he needs
is a little exercise to this out.

463
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:28,237
Roderick, stop that !

464
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:34,404
He's a terribly important man. Six government positions.

465
00:41:34,405 --> 00:41:37,203
Imagine ! Or is it eight ?
It's two, Roderick.

466
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:41,645
Two ! I'm so sorry.

467
00:41:42,946 --> 00:41:46,839
And you ought to see the ring he gave her.
Tony, display it.

468
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:53,440
A diamond. 5/8 of carat.
You couldn't expect less from a man with ten government positions, could you ?

469
00:41:53,441 --> 00:41:57,677
Roderick, it's a very nice ring and you know
I hate big stones. Youve been drinking.

470
00:41:57,678 --> 00:41:59,579
No I have not.
Yes you have.

471
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,855
My dear, for the sake of clarifying our future relationship
I prefer not to be contradicted.

472
00:42:04,856 --> 00:42:07,780
I believe you have come here with the
deliberate intention of insulting me.

473
00:42:07,781 --> 00:42:11,436
No, no ! Emphatically no !
That's my hat !

474
00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:12,941
So it is.
You did it on purpose.

475
00:42:12,942 --> 00:42:14,955
Correct again.

476
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:20,934
Antonya, I insist for the last time that you choose between
me and this disorderly brother of yours.

477
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:23,295
You've made it very easy for me to choose, Mr. Lushin.

478
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:26,416
Here's your 5/8 of a carat ring.

479
00:42:26,417 --> 00:42:31,201
And this is for my mother's hotel bill.
And this is for a new hat !

480
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:34,252
Your humble servant !

481
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,262
That settles him.
Roderick, where did you get this money ?

482
00:42:39,263 --> 00:42:41,987
Dimitri, where did he get that money ?
Search me. Where did you get it, Roderick ?

483
00:42:41,988 --> 00:42:44,267
All I had to do was ask for it.

484
00:42:44,268 --> 00:42:47,901
Take what you want.
Plan it, cheat, bluff. Take life by the throat.

485
00:42:47,902 --> 00:42:54,484
Come on. Let's go out and celebrate Mr. Lushin's disposition.
I mean, his final disposition.

486
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:59,761
To my ex-future brother-in-law and
all his government positions.

487
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:04,816
May they increase and multiply.
And may his children, if any, be tax collectors.

488
00:43:06,049 --> 00:43:09,270
y the way, Roderick, I'm about to ask your sister
if I may call on her tomorrow.

489
00:43:09,271 --> 00:43:12,935
As I've seen how you kick her suitors out, do you object ?
Suppose I do ?

490
00:43:12,936 --> 00:43:13,936
All right, here's a chance to stub your toes.

491
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:17,202
Antonya, may I call on you tomorrow ?

492
00:43:17,203 --> 00:43:20,248
I'm afraid if I don't say yes he'll kick me out.

493
00:43:23,693 --> 00:43:29,667
According to this entry in my book you visited the murdered woman on July, 11.
Is that right ?

494
00:43:29,668 --> 00:43:31,339
Yes, sir.
At what time ?

495
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:34,763
About 7 o'clock.
Are these the articles you pawned ?

496
00:43:34,764 --> 00:43:37,109
Yes, sir.
What do you do for a living ?

497
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:42,483
How long have you been away from home ?
About 4 months.

498
00:43:42,484 --> 00:43:45,575
Any trouble with the police during that time ?
No, sir.

499
00:43:51,376 --> 00:43:53,530
You'd better take this Bible with you.

500
00:43:54,808 --> 00:43:56,630
Thank you, sir.

501
00:43:56,631 --> 00:43:58,575
Just a minute.

502
00:43:59,776 --> 00:44:02,787
While you were doing business with the pawnbroker did you
notice anyone else ?

503
00:44:02,788 --> 00:44:05,701
Someone came to pawn a watch while I was there.

504
00:44:05,702 --> 00:44:07,244
A man or a woman ?
A man.

505
00:44:07,245 --> 00:44:11,002
What did he look like ? Can you describe him ?
Oh, yes. I know his name. Raskolnikov.

506
00:44:11,003 --> 00:44:12,741
Oh...

507
00:44:16,542 --> 00:44:20,116
Do you know him well ?
No, sir, I'd never seen him before.

508
00:44:20,117 --> 00:44:22,569
I talked to him later as we were going out and...

509
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,069
I dropped a ruble and he helped me find it...

510
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:27,718
then he gave my little brother some money.

511
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:31,319
How much ?
9 rubles. I think it was all he had.

512
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,511
Generous, eh ?
Oh, yes, he's the finest man I've ever met.

513
00:44:35,512 --> 00:44:39,752
Find out if Raskolnikov still lives at the same address.
Yes, sir.

514
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:48,705
How often have you seen him since then ?

515
00:44:48,706 --> 00:44:52,402
Only once, sir. When I went to thank him for the money he gave my little brother.

516
00:44:52,403 --> 00:44:56,584
So you know where he lives.
I found out by asking the pawnbroker.

517
00:44:56,585 --> 00:44:59,273
You saw her again too ? When was that ?

518
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:02,326
The next morning. She was very cross with me for bothering her.

519
00:45:02,327 --> 00:45:06,815
She was, was she ?
The old hag. I daresay she deserved what she got.

520
00:45:06,816 --> 00:45:08,701
That's just what he said.

521
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:14,018
Then you did see him after the murder.
Oh, no. He said things like that before she was killed.

522
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:18,847
What else did he say about her ?
Do you remember the exact words ?

523
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:24,072
No, sir. I'm not even sure that he said the things I told you.
I don't remember, really.

524
00:45:24,073 --> 00:45:29,841
He still lives at the same address, sir. He paid the landlady
the 30 rubles he owed her the same morning he was here.

525
00:45:29,842 --> 00:45:32,502
That was the morning after the murder, wasn't it ?

526
00:45:34,203 --> 00:45:37,917
Yes, sir.
From my questions, you think I suspect your friend.

527
00:45:37,918 --> 00:45:42,189
That's not so. I have a very high regard for him.

528
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:44,178
You may go now.

529
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,983
I want to thank you for this.

530
00:45:58,884 --> 00:46:00,965
What are you doing here ?

531
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:05,690
The Inspector sent for me. He returned my Bible and
asked me a few questions.

532
00:46:05,691 --> 00:46:07,423
Did he want to know anything about me ?

533
00:46:07,424 --> 00:46:09,382
Yes.
What did you...

534
00:46:09,383 --> 00:46:13,657
I must see you later. Where do you live ?
On Katherine St. The first house from the bridge, 2nd floor.

535
00:46:13,658 --> 00:46:16,235
I'll be over to sse you as soon as I'm through here.

536
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,727
How are you, sir ?
Have a cigarette ?

537
00:46:22,728 --> 00:46:24,273
Err... no, sir.

538
00:46:24,274 --> 00:46:26,750
You're not smoking ?
Yes, sir.

539
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,927
Too bad.
I'll announce you to the Inspector.

540
00:46:29,928 --> 00:46:31,851
I'll announce myself.

541
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:38,036
Good morning, Inspector.
Good morning, good morning.

542
00:46:38,037 --> 00:46:42,910
I'm so so delighted to see you again that I'm not even
going to ask if you have any special reason in coming here.

543
00:46:42,911 --> 00:46:44,879
As a matter of fact I have.

544
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,282
I was hoping this visit was an act of pure friendship.

545
00:46:52,738 --> 00:46:55,652
Will you have a little brandy.
I never refuse.

546
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,515
Your health, Professor.

547
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:07,765
Thank you.

548
00:47:08,901 --> 00:47:12,392
I've come to claim a watch that must have
come into your possession.

549
00:47:12,393 --> 00:47:16,076
Into my possession ?
I hated to part with it but...

550
00:47:16,077 --> 00:47:18,324
necessity often gets the better of sentiment.

551
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:20,865
So I took it to the old woman to pawn.

552
00:47:20,866 --> 00:47:23,708
What old woman ?

553
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:31,923
The pawnbroker. The one we were talking about.
Oh, did you have dealings with her ?

554
00:47:31,924 --> 00:47:35,405
You know all about that by now.
Oh, not at all. Or should I ?

555
00:47:37,006 --> 00:47:39,225
Didn't you find my name in her book ?

556
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:43,026
Let me see.

557
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,948
Oh, yes, to be sure. I don't know how I could have missed it.

558
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:59,867
You know, you're the first of our clients to come here voluntarily.

559
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:03,293
Perhaps the others are all afraid to.

560
00:48:03,294 --> 00:48:06,193
Except for you, not a Napoleon in the whole outfit.

561
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:12,547
Excuse me.

562
00:48:12,548 --> 00:48:15,048
Thank you.

563
00:48:23,953 --> 00:48:27,022
I'm sorry but your watch isn't listed
among the things we found at her place.

564
00:48:27,023 --> 00:48:33,719
I'm afraid it's in the possession of the murderer.
I hope you'll do all you can to get it back for me.

565
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,297
I assure you. I'll leave nothing undone to locate your watch.

566
00:48:39,298 --> 00:48:41,386
Thank you.

567
00:48:41,387 --> 00:48:43,577
I knew you'd feel that way about it.

568
00:48:44,478 --> 00:48:48,968
Incidentally, I'm wondering why you didn't mention
your watch the day you were in my office.

569
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:51,172
The day you fainted.

570
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:55,033
One doesn't like to talk about going to a pawnshop.

571
00:48:55,034 --> 00:48:57,724
Of course not. I quite understand.

572
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:07,525
Something the matter with your eye ?

573
00:49:07,713 --> 00:49:10,894
Yes, it has a silly habit of twitching at the wrong moment.

574
00:49:10,895 --> 00:49:12,758
I have no control over it, really.

575
00:49:12,759 --> 00:49:16,103
Or perhaps it was dazzled by the splendor of your new clothes.

576
00:49:16,104 --> 00:49:18,507
Things ahve taken a turn for the better, eh ?

577
00:49:18,508 --> 00:49:21,695
Yes. Things have taken a turn for the better.

578
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:25,596
How about another drink ?

579
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,159
I'm sorry you must leave so soon.

580
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,256
Going anywhere in particular ?
I was going to visit my mother.

581
00:49:43,257 --> 00:49:46,240
They say every great man owes his genius to his mother.

582
00:49:46,241 --> 00:49:48,359
I should like to meet her.

583
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:53,907
This is Captain Porfiry, Chief Inspector of all the Police.
My mother and sister.

584
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,035
How do you do ?
How do you do ?

585
00:49:55,036 --> 00:49:59,409
I'm honored.
And this young man has practically been living here for the past 2 weeks.

586
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:03,872
We may need your help to throw him out.
Don't be silly, Roderick. We love having Dimitri here.

587
00:50:05,073 --> 00:50:09,087
He seems to like this place. Maybe the police can tell me why.

588
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:15,297
You don't have to take this for that.

589
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,707
Inspector.

590
00:50:28,708 --> 00:50:31,470
To the Police.
You're hitting it pretty hard today.

591
00:50:31,471 --> 00:50:35,633
You've already had 2 drinks in my office today.
I'm glad the Inspector mentioned it.

592
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:39,134
I've been worrying about it too.
Even Dimitri has spoken about it.

593
00:50:39,135 --> 00:50:41,217
By the way, does your son faint easily ?

594
00:50:41,218 --> 00:50:44,375
Why no.
Have you ever known him to faint ?

595
00:50:44,376 --> 00:50:49,404
The reason I ask, about two weeks ago in my office
they brought in a man suspected of murder.

596
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:51,914
At the mention of the word murder he fainted dead away.

597
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:53,551
I told you why, didn't I ?

598
00:50:53,552 --> 00:50:55,155
It was the heat.
And you were starving.

599
00:50:55,156 --> 00:50:56,873
Yes.
Too poor to buy food.

600
00:50:56,874 --> 00:51:00,495
Yet that very morning you produced 30 rubles
and paid your rent.

601
00:51:00,496 --> 00:51:04,834
Where did you get that money ?
Isn't your giant mind equal to that mystery ?

602
00:51:04,835 --> 00:51:08,555
You might ask my friend.
He borrowed the 30 rubles from me.

603
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:12,067
When ?
Say what is this ? A cross-examination ?

604
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:16,557
Yes. He invites himself into my home
and then he accuses me of murder.

605
00:51:16,558 --> 00:51:19,256
Murder ?
He committed murder ? What are you talking about ?

606
00:51:19,257 --> 00:51:23,103
Are you crazy ?
Don't put words in my mouth. I made no accusation.

607
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:25,776
Then why all this ? What have you against me ?

608
00:51:25,777 --> 00:51:28,826
The fact that I visited the pawnbroker and didn't tell you ?

609
00:51:28,827 --> 00:51:31,373
That I fainted ? My new clothes ?

610
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:34,672
Here's some money too.

611
00:51:34,673 --> 00:51:37,813
Let your detectives look into that.

612
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:41,375
Roderick, I don't think you should talk to the Inspector like that.

613
00:51:41,376 --> 00:51:46,399
Inspector. Inspect this. No man could have the nerve to commit a murder...

614
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,560
then sit in your office watch you accuse another man
and tell you he's not guilty.

615
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:57,861
If I were the guilty man I'd find a big stone with a hollow under it
and hide the loot for years.

616
00:51:57,862 --> 00:52:01,088
Don't you think I know that you would wait for the junk to appear ?

617
00:52:01,089 --> 00:52:07,801
Accuse me of murder if you like. But don't insult me by believing
that I'd overlook 1500 rubles in a matress.

618
00:52:07,802 --> 00:52:12,693
Use your clumsy methods on halfwits,
like the poor fool's life you are going to take...

619
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,754
to keep your record clear.

620
00:52:14,755 --> 00:52:19,758
Well, I must have been wrong.
I apologize. Excuse me.

621
00:52:19,759 --> 00:52:21,903
Say it again and say it loud.

622
00:52:21,904 --> 00:52:26,196
Please excuse me. I guess I was a little overzealous.

623
00:52:26,197 --> 00:52:29,319
I'm still just a blundering policeman.

624
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,922
Your health, Professor !

625
00:52:53,224 --> 00:52:57,553
I've been waiting for hours. I thought you'd come sooner.
I couldn't. What did the Inspector want to know ?

626
00:53:01,008 --> 00:53:03,112
Excuse me.

627
00:53:10,908 --> 00:53:12,649
Can you tell me where the room is that's for rent ?

628
00:53:12,650 --> 00:53:16,929
Next door. But you'll have to see the landlady about it.
Thank you. I'm a stranger in the city.

629
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:19,572
And I must find a room somewhere tonight.

630
00:53:25,817 --> 00:53:27,662
Wasn't he at the police station this afternoon ?

631
00:53:27,663 --> 00:53:30,263
I didn't notice.
They're following me.

632
00:53:30,264 --> 00:53:33,330
Who ?
The police.
Why ? What have you done ? What are you afraid of ?

633
00:53:33,331 --> 00:53:34,953
Nothing.

634
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:45,037
Sonya, did you tell the Inspector about meeting me at the pawnbroker's ?

635
00:53:45,038 --> 00:53:46,800
Yes.

636
00:53:46,801 --> 00:53:51,004
Then he knew all about my going there to pawn the watch.

637
00:53:51,005 --> 00:53:53,205
Yes, I told him.

638
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:56,829
What else did you tell him ?
Only about the money you gave us.

639
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:00,243
And then he wanted to know...
What ? What else did he want to know ?

640
00:54:00,244 --> 00:54:04,008
Before I knew what happened he made me tell him what you said.
That she deserved to die.

641
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,856
I tried to take it back afterwards.

642
00:54:12,257 --> 00:54:15,295
Why take it back ? I said it to him myself.

643
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:17,839
Why did you think you had to defend me ?

644
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:22,838
You didn't kill her, did you ?

645
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:29,462
I don't know why, but the thought just
went by me just now like a cold wind.

646
00:54:30,863 --> 00:54:33,463
Forgive me.

647
00:54:33,667 --> 00:54:36,878
If I thought you could do a thing like that I wouldn't want to live.

648
00:54:36,879 --> 00:54:41,556
What do you care ? What I am
or what I do ?

649
00:54:41,557 --> 00:54:45,159
I didn't tell you something else the Inspector made me admit.

650
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,081
What ?

651
00:54:47,082 --> 00:54:49,989
That you were the finest man I'd ever met.

652
00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:09,678
I do this almost every night. Come out
here and look down into the water.

653
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,374
Sometimes the water seems full of stars.

654
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:16,479
And then I feel I could lift this bucket to have them
and pull up a whole pailful of them.

655
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:19,935
You're lonely, aren't you ?

656
00:55:19,936 --> 00:55:21,637
You are too.

657
00:55:24,438 --> 00:55:29,395
I wonder how many poor devils have found
an answer to their questions down there.

658
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:35,060
If only the dead could ever come back.

659
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:37,497
They have.

660
00:55:45,498 --> 00:55:41,907
Remember the raising of Lazarus ?

661
00:55:41,708 --> 00:55:49,669
Are you happy to have your Bible back ?
Would you like me to read you the raising of Lazarus ?

662
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:57,605
I can't understand you, Sonya.
How can you continue living like this ?

663
00:55:57,606 --> 00:56:02,473
I believe in God.
But have you a right to hope for an afterlife ?

664
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:05,591
Don't take away my faith. I need it.

665
00:56:05,692 --> 00:56:08,369
Don't take away my unbelief.

666
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,317
I need that.

667
00:56:10,318 --> 00:56:14,207
You couldn't be so blasphemous unless
something were troubling you terribly.

668
00:56:14,235 --> 00:56:16,065
Won't you tell me what it is ?

669
00:56:16,066 --> 00:56:18,358
I wish I could.

670
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,895
I can't, no.

671
00:57:35,284 --> 00:57:37,474
I hope you'll pardon me calling so early.

672
00:57:37,475 --> 00:57:40,634
I've been trying since yesterday morning
to get in touch with you.

673
00:57:40,635 --> 00:57:45,309
My name is Grilov.
Hasn't your sister ever spoken of me ?

674
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,531
She was employed as governess in my home.

675
00:57:47,532 --> 00:57:49,313
Don't lie to me. You're from the police.

676
00:57:49,314 --> 00:57:51,973
The police ?
I saw you testerday at Police Headquarters.

677
00:57:51,974 --> 00:57:54,166
I went there to find out where you lived.

678
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:56,993
I thought because of your work in criminology they might know.

679
00:57:56,994 --> 00:57:59,290
Afterwards you followed me, didn't you ?

680
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:01,756
I know. I waited hoping to see you when you came out.

681
00:58:01,757 --> 00:58:04,898
But you were with the Inspector and I didn't want to intrude.

682
00:58:04,899 --> 00:58:08,969
So I went to the address I heard that girl give you
and rented a room there.

683
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,051
Feeling sure I'd run into you sooner or later.

684
00:58:12,252 --> 00:58:14,316
I hope that clears me of all suspicion.

685
00:58:18,917 --> 00:58:21,354
Then why did you trace me and what do you want ?

686
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:23,596
Your assistance in clearing up a great injustice.

687
00:58:23,597 --> 00:58:26,125
It is because of me that your sister lost her position.

688
00:58:26,126 --> 00:58:29,121
It is because of me that a good name... Well I'll be frank with you...

689
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:31,729
at the time this happened I was very infatuated with Antonya.

690
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:33,487
But all that's over.

691
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:36,953
Why do you tell me all this ?
I want you to go to see it for me with your sister.

692
00:58:36,954 --> 00:58:38,839
I know she won't see me.

693
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:43,075
Odd isn't it ? What did you expect, her gratitude ?

694
00:58:43,076 --> 00:58:46,399
Hardly. That's why I came to you.
I want you to give her this.

695
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:49,454
My wife died and left some money to your sister.
500 rubles.

696
00:58:49,455 --> 00:58:52,738
To make up for her unjust suspicion.

697
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,997
All I'm asking is that you give her the money,
let me see her and apologize.

698
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,165
Haven't you ever committed a wrong ?

699
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:04,160
If you have you must know that the worst consequences are the unforeseen ones.

700
00:59:04,161 --> 00:59:06,228
It's like dropping a stone in a pool.

701
00:59:06,229 --> 00:59:10,207
Waves spread in all directions and touch shores
you had never seen before.

702
00:59:12,008 --> 00:59:14,486
You're trying to buy your way into my sister's life again.

703
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:17,113
500 rubles and a lot of hipocrisy.

704
00:59:17,114 --> 00:59:21,472
Well you can't. She's happy and she's forgotten you ever existed.

705
00:59:21,473 --> 00:59:25,917
Your money comes too late and
your apologies unwanted. Get out !

706
00:59:27,018 --> 00:59:31,604
All right. I'll see your sister and it won't cost 500 rubles.

707
00:59:31,605 --> 00:59:34,267
Hello. Someone has money to throw away.

708
00:59:36,468 --> 00:59:38,456
Quite an aggressive gentleman, eh ?

709
00:59:38,457 --> 00:59:42,210
Your powers of deduction again, Inspector.
Now, don't rub it in.

710
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,165
So this is where you live, eh ?

711
00:59:45,366 --> 00:59:48,002
I knew I'd find a picture of Napoleon here.

712
00:59:48,003 --> 00:59:50,912
But Beethoven ? What a strange pair.

713
00:59:50,913 --> 00:59:53,975
You know, Beethoven dedicated a symphony to Napoleon.

714
00:59:53,976 --> 00:59:56,578
And when he discovered Napoleon was a false god...

715
00:59:56,579 --> 00:59:59,034
he tore up his dedication.

716
00:59:59,035 --> 01:00:01,374
I wonder whether you'll feel the same way some day.

717
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:04,395
I doubt it, but you didn't come here to improve my mind, did you ?

718
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:07,885
No. Look here. I had to talk to you alone, away from your family.
Why ?

719
01:00:07,886 --> 01:00:12,096
To accuse me privately ?
I'll admit I connected you with the murder of the old pawnbroker.

720
01:00:12,097 --> 01:00:16,303
Not at our first meeting, mind you. But later.
You know how a police mind functions.

721
01:00:16,304 --> 01:00:18,741
I began piecing things into a pattern.

722
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:22,143
Your desperate poverty. Your sister marrying for your sake.

723
01:00:22,144 --> 01:00:24,335
Your fainting when the arrested man was brought in.

724
01:00:24,336 --> 01:00:27,010
All this talk about supermen being above the law.

725
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:31,024
Flashing all that money which I didn't know until this morning
came from your publishers.

726
01:00:31,025 --> 01:00:33,677
You must concede it would have looked pretty bad even to you.

727
01:00:33,678 --> 01:00:37,090
Then you no longer connect me with this amateurish crime.

728
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,838
Please put that thought out of your mind once and for all.

729
01:00:39,839 --> 01:00:42,997
May I smoke ?
Make yourself at home.

730
01:00:42,998 --> 01:00:46,095
You know, I burn 30 or 40 of these a day ?

731
01:00:46,096 --> 01:00:47,996
Nerves, that's all.

732
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:55,380
Would you believe it ? Every time I'm brought
face to face with a guilty man, I smoke...

733
01:00:55,517 --> 01:00:58,917
I drum with my fingers...

734
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,542
pace up and down the room, talk about all
sorts of irrelevent things.

735
01:01:04,543 --> 01:01:06,715
just to avoid getting to the point.

736
01:01:08,816 --> 01:01:10,833
Absurd isn't it ?

737
01:01:11,928 --> 01:01:15,687
If this case isn't cleared up soon I'm afraid I'm going to have a breakdown.

738
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:25,253
I know what you were thinking.
You thought I was looking for a poker.

739
01:01:25,254 --> 01:01:29,562
Nothing of the kind.
Why don't you say what you want to say instead of hounding me ?

740
01:01:29,563 --> 01:01:33,608
I don't hound a man I think is guilty.
I leave him alone.

741
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:35,231
I sit back and wait.

742
01:01:35,232 --> 01:01:40,892
But I give him just a little hint that I know about his crime, that
I watch him night and day.

743
01:01:40,893 --> 01:01:45,708
Chances are he will try to escape.
And that's when I like to catch him.

744
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:51,947
If he's in continual fear and suspicion
he's bound to lose his head and do something...

745
01:01:51,948 --> 01:01:55,148
that will make his guilt as plain...

746
01:01:55,149 --> 01:01:59,816
as the fact that there's no poker in this room.

747
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,250
I must get back to my duties.

748
01:02:08,757 --> 01:02:11,784
This isn't getting the murderer.

749
01:02:13,585 --> 01:02:17,078
I wonder how far away from here he is at this moment.

750
01:02:18,579 --> 01:02:26,996
Speaking of nerves. I actually know of cases where the criminal has
returned to the scene of the crime as if he were drawn by a magnet.

751
01:02:26,997 --> 01:02:31,678
Do something foolish like ringing a bell and running away.

752
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:37,002
Strange, isn't it ? I must say for a great specialist
in crime you're not helping me very much.

753
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:41,261
If you arrive at a conclusion, come in to see me.
I'm always in at 4 o'clock.

754
01:02:49,217 --> 01:02:51,726
You're early. I didn't expect you for an hour.

755
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:54,602
Oh, I forgot. You haven't your watch.

756
01:02:54,702 --> 01:02:59,152
Stop playing this cat and mouse with me.
If you have a case against me arrest me !

757
01:02:59,203 --> 01:03:01,132
Relieve me of your time !

758
01:03:04,033 --> 01:03:06,800
My dear fellow...
Don't dear fellow me !

759
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:10,250
I won't allow you to keep on torturing me. I won't allow it !

760
01:03:10,251 --> 01:03:13,936
I'm afraid your nerves are going to pieces.

761
01:03:22,345 --> 01:03:26,120
You remind me of certain types connected with every important crime.

762
01:03:26,121 --> 01:03:31,242
Awful nuisances. They get to thinking about it.
Brooding over it.

763
01:03:31,243 --> 01:03:34,694
By some peculiar mental twist they convince themselves
that they're guilty.

764
01:03:34,695 --> 01:03:37,343
And then they come here like you.

765
01:03:38,444 --> 01:03:40,612
And insist that we put them in jail.

766
01:03:42,213 --> 01:03:47,529
Go out in the open. Take a walk.
Watch the clouds. Let peace enter your troubled mind.

767
01:03:47,530 --> 01:03:50,949
There's no greater blessing on this earth than peace.

768
01:03:53,069 --> 01:03:57,815
If you are guilty the very last thing to do would be to throw you in prison
because I'd put you out of suspense.

769
01:04:01,184 --> 01:04:03,893
I'd let your mind regain its strength.

770
01:04:03,894 --> 01:04:09,095
I might even deprive myself
of the chance of getting further evidence against you.

771
01:04:10,157 --> 01:04:17,083
In a case like this I can afford to wait. Sooner or later
the man will come to me and confess because he wants peace.

772
01:04:17,084 --> 01:04:21,223
Did you know that when a man voluntarily confesses
his sentence is reduced ?

773
01:04:23,024 --> 01:04:29,154
I may sound like a preacher, but the truth remains.
There is no prisoner steelbound as a man's conscience.

774
01:04:29,155 --> 01:04:36,139
Nothing that we can devise is as horrible as the torture
conscience will inflict on a man.

775
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:45,861
Conscience, day and night, waking and dreaming.
Take your hands off me !

776
01:04:50,162 --> 01:04:54,499
Why should it be my lot to break down a man ?
What a profession.

777
01:04:54,500 --> 01:04:59,828
I should like nothing better than to get
away from this clearing house of crime.

778
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:03,062
Take a walk in the country.

779
01:05:03,424 --> 01:05:06,357
Excuse me, Inspector.
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone ?

780
01:05:06,358 --> 01:05:09,016
Get out of here.
Get out before I break your neck.

781
01:05:09,017 --> 01:05:11,663
But the man has just confessed.

782
01:05:11,664 --> 01:05:14,292
I confess ! I'm guilty !

783
01:05:14,293 --> 01:05:17,006
I'm the murderer ! Punish me !

784
01:05:17,007 --> 01:05:19,106
You're lying. You didn't kill her.

785
01:05:19,107 --> 01:05:23,350
I tied those knots, I tell you.
I hit her over the head with the poker. I'm the murderer !

786
01:05:23,439 --> 01:05:27,865
I hated her.
Why, you idiot, you didn't even know about her until we arrested you.

787
01:05:27,866 --> 01:05:30,319
You didn't know anything about it until we beat it into you.

788
01:05:30,320 --> 01:05:33,866
Take him away. If he wants to go to Siberia, let him.

789
01:05:33,867 --> 01:05:37,169
Punish me ! I want to die !

790
01:05:38,865 --> 01:05:40,136
I didn't expect that.

791
01:05:41,673 --> 01:05:43,819
Good work, Inspector.

792
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:48,257
What a triumph for your methods.

793
01:05:48,258 --> 01:05:52,461
First you make him confess,
then you try to make him believe he's innocent.

794
01:05:55,002 --> 01:05:57,300
Marvelous Police Department.

795
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:03,246
Let the man alone. Let his mind be addressed,
let this conscience be his prison.

796
01:06:03,247 --> 01:06:07,980
What was that beautiful expression ? Steelbound !
You should have been a writer.

797
01:06:07,981 --> 01:06:11,581
Better take that walk in the country, Inspector. You need it.

798
01:06:23,031 --> 01:06:24,795
Are you in a hurry ?

799
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:27,661
No.
Sonya, I must talk to you. I...

800
01:06:27,662 --> 01:06:30,717
I may never see you again.
You're going away ?

801
01:06:30,718 --> 01:06:32,520
Yes.
Where are you going ?

802
01:06:34,621 --> 01:06:37,236
I don't know.
Then why ?

803
01:06:37,237 --> 01:06:39,067
Because...

804
01:06:39,068 --> 01:06:41,871
I'm free now.
Free from what ?

805
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,672
From the police. They...

806
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:45,858
suspected me of murder.

807
01:06:45,859 --> 01:06:48,371
But that's all over now.

808
01:07:03,072 --> 01:07:05,224
Sonya. Come away with me.

809
01:07:05,225 --> 01:07:07,383
Let's leave all this.

810
01:07:07,384 --> 01:07:11,303
We'll get out into the open where there's peace.
Did they find the guilty man ?

811
01:07:11,304 --> 01:07:13,606
He confessed this morning.
Who was it ?

812
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:16,846
A painter who worked in the house.
Why all these questions ?

813
01:07:16,847 --> 01:07:19,486
Leave me alone asking questions. Enough !

814
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:24,636
Put that away. I don't want to be reminded of that old hag.

815
01:07:24,637 --> 01:07:27,306
There was a cave and a stone lay against it.

816
01:07:27,307 --> 01:07:32,045
And He said: Take away the stone.
What stone ? What stone are you talkimg about ?

817
01:07:32,046 --> 01:07:36,264
How do you know there was a stone ?
It's the stone under which Lazarus was buried.

818
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,648
And Martha, the sister of Lazarus, said:

819
01:07:38,649 --> 01:07:41,597
For he has been dead for 4 days.
And He said to her:

820
01:07:41,598 --> 01:07:43,868
If thou believe thou shalt see the glory of God.

821
01:07:43,869 --> 01:07:47,598
And so they took away the stone
and He lifted up his eyes and said:

822
01:07:47,599 --> 01:07:49,833
Father I thank Thee that Thou has heard me...

823
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:52,581
And when he had first spoken he cried in a loud voice:

824
01:07:52,582 --> 01:07:55,594
Lazarus, come forth. And he that was dead...

825
01:07:55,595 --> 01:07:57,370
came forth.

826
01:08:08,471 --> 01:08:11,828
Sonya. Sonya.
You shouldn't kneel to me.

827
01:08:11,829 --> 01:08:14,650
Have mercy on me.

828
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
Why did you do it ?

829
01:08:36,165 --> 01:08:38,496
I was mad, Sonya.

830
01:08:38,497 --> 01:08:40,171
I was mad.

831
01:08:40,172 --> 01:08:44,531
What shall I do now ?
I don't know what to tell you because you have no faith.

832
01:08:44,532 --> 01:08:48,117
And if I did have faith ?
Then I could tell you to confess.

833
01:08:48,118 --> 01:08:49,987
And atone for what you've done.

834
01:08:49,989 --> 01:08:51,619
Confess to the police ?

835
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:54,502
How else can you save
someone who's being punished instead of you ?

836
01:08:54,503 --> 01:08:56,760
Confess to the police ?

837
01:08:56,761 --> 01:08:59,000
And rot in prison ?

838
01:08:59,001 --> 01:09:01,462
Is that fool's life that valuable to you ?

839
01:09:01,463 --> 01:09:03,884
It's his life. You have no
right to take it away from him.

840
01:09:03,885 --> 01:09:07,145
Why do you think of him ?
Why don't you think of me ?

841
01:09:07,146 --> 01:09:10,162
I am thinking of you.
You can't carry such a burden.

842
01:09:10,163 --> 01:09:13,113
It'll be a greater
punishment than any the law can give you.

843
01:09:13,114 --> 01:09:16,339
You can't stand it.
I'll get used to it.

844
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:18,771
I'm not as week as you think.

845
01:09:18,772 --> 01:09:22,019
I was strong enough to commit a crime.

846
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:25,057
I'll be strong enough to live with it.

847
01:09:39,170 --> 01:09:41,963
Will you let me kiss you before I go ?

848
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:45,235
Antonya. Do you see that door ?
Sonya lives on the other side of it.

849
01:10:45,236 --> 01:10:49,406
I listened.
And I heard your brother tell her that he committed a murder.

850
01:10:58,162 --> 01:11:01,098
You can't make me believe that.
You made it up.

851
01:11:01,099 --> 01:11:04,794
It's another one of your contemptible schemes.
No, Antonya, I'm not lying.

852
01:11:04,796 --> 01:11:07,594
Ask the girl yourself.
Do you want me to call her in ?

853
01:11:07,595 --> 01:11:11,729
But you know it's true.
You must have noticed how strangely your brother has been behaving.

854
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:16,353
The other day I went to see him
and it frightened him out of his wits because he thought I was from the police.

855
01:11:16,354 --> 01:11:19,740
Antonya, I'll help you get him
out of the country. Anywhere you say.

856
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:22,138
I have money and friends.

857
01:11:22,139 --> 01:11:25,376
I'll do anything for you.
Anything.

858
01:11:25,377 --> 01:11:27,438
I don't believe it.

859
01:11:38,809 --> 01:11:40,325
I don't believe it.
All right then. It's my dity to inform the police.

860
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:36,926
Open the door.

861
01:11:40,561 --> 01:11:43,349
If you really loved your brother you wouldn't force me to go to the police.

862
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:45,478
But you love your brother and you can love me too.

863
01:11:45,479 --> 01:11:48,462
I know I made a bad start.
But things are different now.

864
01:11:48,463 --> 01:11:52,632
We'd be married and go away together.

865
01:11:52,633 --> 01:11:55,035
Be happier than you ever dreamed.

866
01:11:55,036 --> 01:11:57,938
Antonya, please.
Keep away from me.

867
01:12:01,234 --> 01:12:03,725
That's the gun you used to keep in my home, isn't it ?

868
01:12:03,726 --> 01:12:05,339
Keep away !

869
01:12:15,026 --> 01:12:17,011
Please let me go.

870
01:12:29,312 --> 01:12:31,379
Here's the key.

871
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:59,239
I hope you intend to search the place.
Not thoroughly.

872
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,075
Find what you were looking for ?
Not here.

873
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:05,223
But downstairs in the porter's
room I found this poker.

874
01:13:05,224 --> 01:13:09,199
I'm pretty sure it's the death weapon.
You see that bend ?

875
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,146
It left an irregular stain on the apron
which could have been made only with a poker like this.

876
01:13:18,147 --> 01:13:20,874
The porter tells me
it was missing on the night of the murder.

877
01:13:20,875 --> 01:13:24,117
It was returned later on his absence.

878
01:13:24,118 --> 01:13:27,292
Furthermore, I'm certain when
I have it examined I'll find bloodstains on it.

879
01:13:27,293 --> 01:13:29,983
You know perfectly well that isn't evidence enough.

880
01:13:29,984 --> 01:13:33,279
I know that.
Perfectly well.

881
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:37,382
Anyway, if that is the poker
you have the confession of the man who says he used it.

882
01:13:37,383 --> 01:13:41,649
He doesn't know what he's saying.
He belongs in a hospital, not a prison.

883
01:13:45,508 --> 01:13:48,462
You're the murderer.
You and nobody else.

884
01:13:50,163 --> 01:13:53,236
You can't prove it.
You can never prove it.

885
01:13:54,537 --> 01:13:57,528
Maybe I can, maybe I can't.

886
01:13:57,329 --> 01:13:59,840
But I'll make a deal with you.

887
01:13:59,841 --> 01:14:05,018
If you admit your crime now
I'll stage it so that your confession will come as a complete surprise.

888
01:14:05,019 --> 01:14:08,472
One of those last minute affairs to clear an innocent man.

889
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:13,075
There are plenty of extenuating circumstances.

890
01:14:13,076 --> 01:14:16,901
The most you can get is a few years.
I didn't do it.

891
01:14:25,023 --> 01:14:27,611
How long do you think you can keep up this pretense ?

892
01:14:27,612 --> 01:14:30,284
Forever ?

893
01:14:30,285 --> 01:14:32,370
For all eternity ?

894
01:14:32,371 --> 01:14:35,318
You're wasting your time.

895
01:14:36,219 --> 01:14:39,528
Then I'm afraid I'll have
to send an innocent man to Siberia.

896
01:14:39,529 --> 01:14:44,005
Very likely to his death.
It's not my doing, after all. It's yours.

897
01:14:45,666 --> 01:14:49,019
I don't know how you'll feel about it
but it's a worse crime than the other.

898
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,101
And it's way more cold-blooded and fiendish.

899
01:14:52,102 --> 01:14:56,256
And Napoleon might be able to carry that off,
but you're not a Napoleon, my firend.

900
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:59,003
You're not hard enough.
And I'm sorry for you.

901
01:14:59,004 --> 01:15:02,239
I wouldn't be in your place for anything in the world.

902
01:15:03,147 --> 01:15:03,737
Oh, by the way.

903
01:15:04,738 --> 01:15:11,389
You once told me if you had committed the crime you
would have looked for a big stone with a hollow underneath...

904
01:15:11,390 --> 01:15:13,620
to hide what you stole.

905
01:15:13,621 --> 01:15:19,265
If at some future time your nerves get
the better of you and you're driven to some desperate measure...

906
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,850
leave a little note behind
telling me where the stone is.

907
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:27,053
I'll consider it a personal favor.

908
01:15:56,256 --> 01:15:58,582
I took the liberty of coming through that door.

909
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:01,085
You really ought to keep it locked.

910
01:16:06,664 --> 01:16:08,499
What's that for ?

911
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:11,102
I suppose I owe you an explanation.

912
01:16:11,103 --> 01:16:13,325
But I prefer not to give any.

913
01:16:13,326 --> 01:16:15,277
You probably need the money.

914
01:16:15,278 --> 01:16:17,013
I don't.

915
01:16:17,014 --> 01:16:19,513
All I want to say is that I am doing this for myself.

916
01:16:22,615 --> 01:16:26,350
I overheard him telling his troubles to you.

917
01:16:26,351 --> 01:16:28,843
Tell him he need fear nothing from me.

918
01:16:28,844 --> 01:16:33,756
What has he to fear from you or anyone else ?
The only one he has to fear now is himself.

919
01:16:36,057 --> 01:16:38,218
You're right, my child.

920
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:42,470
The only one a man ever need fear is himself.

921
01:16:42,793 --> 01:16:46,225
I must find him. I must find him !
Where is he ?

922
01:16:46,226 --> 01:16:48,270
Do you know where he is ?

923
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:52,676
Probably with his sister at the Alexander St. Hotel.

924
01:16:56,156 --> 01:16:58,748
Have you been crying ?
No, mother.

925
01:16:58,749 --> 01:17:02,699
The wind blew something in my eyes.
You have been crying. What's happened ? Did you quarrel with Dimitri ?

926
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:05,297
No.
Is it Roderick ?

927
01:17:14,298 --> 01:17:18,944
Roderick. Something's happened to you.
Antonya knows and is afraid to tell me. What is it ?

928
01:17:36,668 --> 01:17:38,387
You know ?

929
01:17:38,388 --> 01:17:40,576
What are you going to do ?

930
01:17:40,577 --> 01:17:43,687
I'm going away. Leaving the country tonight.

931
01:17:43,688 --> 01:17:46,747
Have you money enough ?
Yes.

932
01:17:46,748 --> 01:17:50,841
Oh, Roderick. Why did you do it ?
Why did you do it ?

933
01:18:02,999 --> 01:18:06,168
You'll take good care of mother, won't you ?

934
01:18:09,446 --> 01:18:12,569
You're going to marry Dimitri.

935
01:18:14,223 --> 01:18:17,569
Tony, after I'm gone...

936
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:19,963
be a friend to Sonya.

937
01:18:32,004 --> 01:18:34,922
You haven't come to me
like this since you were a little boy.

938
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:38,932
Remember ? When you were about six...

939
01:18:38,933 --> 01:18:42,150
the day your school books fell out of your hand ?

940
01:18:42,151 --> 01:18:44,599
They fell on one of the kittens.

941
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,433
I remember how you nursed it back to health.

942
01:18:47,434 --> 01:18:50,852
You were such a sensitive boy.

943
01:18:50,853 --> 01:18:53,598
So afraid of causing pain.

944
01:18:54,999 --> 01:18:59,069
Remember how you asked me
to tell God you didn't mean to do it ?

945
01:18:59,092 --> 01:19:04,206
And when I told God it was so
comforting you fell into a peaceful sleep.

946
01:19:06,707 --> 01:19:08,374
Roderick...

947
01:19:08,375 --> 01:19:11,695
the greatest happiness a mother knows...

948
01:19:11,696 --> 01:19:14,950
is when her children come to her for comfort.

949
01:19:14,951 --> 01:19:19,584
You believe that I am good don't you ?
I know you are.

950
01:19:19,585 --> 01:19:22,653
You know that I always wanted to help you and Tony.

951
01:19:22,654 --> 01:19:24,722
You've always been good to us, Roderick.

952
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,110
No, mother, I haven't.

953
01:19:27,111 --> 01:19:30,708
When I wanted to help you most
I forgot you most.

954
01:19:32,609 --> 01:19:36,517
When will I see you again ?
Tomorrow perhaps.

955
01:19:56,559 --> 01:19:59,460
I know I shouldn't come here, but I must...

956
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:01,580
Then you know it too. He's in trouble.What is it ?

957
01:20:01,581 --> 01:20:04,204
I can only tell you that he needs help.
If it isn't too late.

958
01:20:04,205 --> 01:20:05,678
Where did he go ?
Sonya.

959
01:20:05,679 --> 01:20:09,721
You must stay here tonight. I want to be your friend.
I can't stay here. It may be too late.

960
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,316
I must find him.

961
01:20:11,383 --> 01:20:14,294
Antonya. What has Roderick done ?
You must tell me.

962
01:20:14,295 --> 01:20:17,570
He can't have done anything wrong.
Tell me !

963
01:20:17,571 --> 01:20:20,624
He's only your brother. But he's my son !

964
01:20:20,625 --> 01:20:22,289
You must tell me !

965
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:25,826
Remember that night we arrived ?
That's when it happened.

966
01:20:25,827 --> 01:20:29,044
What happened ?
Remember what the Inspector said the day he was here ?

967
01:20:29,045 --> 01:20:31,813
Mother !

968
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:36,347
He did it for us. He did it for us !

969
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:47,964
Roderick !

970
01:20:49,194 --> 01:20:52,219
What are you doing here ?
I've been looking everywhere for you.

971
01:20:58,240 --> 01:20:59,909
Roderick. What are you doing here ?

972
01:21:01,310 --> 01:21:03,386
I don't know.

973
01:21:04,492 --> 01:21:07,472
Thinking of escape.

974
01:21:08,473 --> 01:21:12,368
Not that way.
No.

975
01:21:12,369 --> 01:21:15,656
That way seems too easy.
Roderick...

976
01:21:15,657 --> 01:21:18,684
last night you wanted to kiss me...

977
01:21:18,685 --> 01:21:21,356
I didn't want you to.

978
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:24,480
The sinner and the saint.

979
01:21:24,481 --> 01:21:28,392
Don't call me a saint. I'm only someone who loves you.
And you're not a sinner.

980
01:21:28,393 --> 01:21:32,554
You didn't do it for yourself.
It's no sin to destroy an ugly thing like a...

981
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:35,518
black beetle.
You wanted to help others.

982
01:21:35,519 --> 01:21:37,923
It was wrong of me to tell you to give yourself up.

983
01:21:37,924 --> 01:21:41,817
Let's go away to a different country.
To some place far off where people won't know us.

984
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:44,820
We've got money enough.
It'll be easy to forget all we've been through.

985
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:48,589
I'll help you to forget.
You'll become famous and I'll be so proud of you.

986
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,411
Forget...
Everything

987
01:21:50,412 --> 01:21:55,747
Even the man who is going to be condemned instead of me ?
He's no man. He's an animal. It won't make any difference for him.

988
01:21:55,748 --> 01:21:59,455
You are giving me back my own words.
And they are ugly.

989
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:03,231
They sound false.
Not now. I believe in them.

990
01:22:08,987 --> 01:22:11,389
You made me see myself.

991
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:13,994
Napoleon.

992
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:17,293
A weakling who thought himself brave.

993
01:22:17,294 --> 01:22:20,060
Who committed a cowardly deed...

994
01:22:20,061 --> 01:22:22,562
and called it an act of humanity.

995
01:22:36,666 --> 01:22:39,589
You were going to pray, weren't you ?

996
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:43,138
You'd like to pray, but you can't.

997
01:22:43,139 --> 01:22:46,491
The prayers won't come.
You know why ?

998
01:22:46,492 --> 01:22:49,168
Because you've taken your sin on yourself.

999
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:52,319
I won't let you throw away your soul for me.

1000
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,243
But I love you.

1001
01:23:00,025 --> 01:23:03,444
Sonya.

1002
01:23:03,582 --> 01:23:07,496
If I go to Siberia, will you wait for me ?

1003
01:23:07,497 --> 01:23:10,987
Please let me go with you.
I'd go anywhere on earth with you.

1004
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:17,080
Years will pass like a day.

1005
01:23:35,381 --> 01:23:37,615
I've been waiting for you.
