1
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,315
In the old days,
the Iand feIt a great emptiness.

2
00:01:11,961 --> 00:01:14,031
It was waiting.

3
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:16,834
Waiting to be filled up.

4
00:01:19,002 --> 00:01:20,994
Waiting for someone to love it.

5
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:25,764
Waiting for a leader.

6
00:01:36,285 --> 00:01:39,326
And he came on the back of a whale,

7
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:41,887
the man to Iead a new peopIe.

8
00:01:43,087 --> 00:01:47,000
Our ancestor Paikea.

9
00:01:52,608 --> 00:01:56,397
But now we were waiting for
the firstborn of the new generation.

10
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:00,444
For the descendant of the whale rider.

11
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,967
For the boy who wouId be chief.

12
00:02:05,731 --> 00:02:07,211
Get the oxygen!

13
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:22,013
Paikea.

14
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:25,534
Paikea.

15
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,931
There was no gladness
when I was born.

16
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:43,890
My twin brother died
and took our mother with him.

17
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,575
Rawiri.

18
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:28,215
Everyone was waiting for
the firstborn boy to Iead us.

19
00:03:29,346 --> 00:03:30,780
But he died.

20
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,627
And I didn't.

21
00:04:06,553 --> 00:04:07,986
Where's the boy?

22
00:04:22,156 --> 00:04:23,589
Son?

23
00:04:24,636 --> 00:04:26,237
What's done is done.

24
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:27,670
Come on.

25
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:35,311
Come home.

26
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,838
Start again.

27
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,080
You mean just pretend
it didn't happen?

28
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,761
That's not what I'm saying.

29
00:04:47,761 --> 00:04:50,081
You didn't even Iook at her, Dad!

30
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,561
She died.

31
00:04:51,561 --> 00:04:53,522
Son...
No! No! No!

32
00:04:53,522 --> 00:04:55,002
Nuh.

33
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:57,442
No, all you want is your boy.

34
00:04:57,442 --> 00:05:00,483
It's aIright.
That's all you want, isn't it?

35
00:05:00,483 --> 00:05:03,077
You can start again.
Hey, I've got a chiId.

36
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:06,964
Her name's Paikea.

37
00:05:06,964 --> 00:05:08,397
What?

38
00:05:09,445 --> 00:05:11,165
You heard me.

39
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:12,645
No.

40
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,126
Not that name.

41
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:16,286
It's Paikea.

42
00:05:16,286 --> 00:05:17,719
No!

43
00:05:22,647 --> 00:05:24,080
Porourangi.

44
00:05:26,728 --> 00:05:28,161
Porourangi!

45
00:05:32,169 --> 00:05:33,602
POROURANGI!

46
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,003
Take her away.

47
00:06:13,016 --> 00:06:15,017
I told you to take her away.

48
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:17,611
No. You acknowIedge
your granddaughter.

49
00:06:28,339 --> 00:06:29,772
She likes you.

50
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,420
He'll have another chiId.

51
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,221
He just Iost a chiId and a wife.
Isn't that enough?

52
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:40,301
You give that boy some time.
You hear me?

53
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:42,302
He'll be back when he's ready.

54
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:52,784
Stupid old Paka.

55
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:55,824
You say the word
and I'll get a divorce, bubba.

56
00:06:55,824 --> 00:06:57,497
Just say the word.

57
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:01,865
What did he say to her?

58
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:03,299
Same old story.

59
00:07:04,346 --> 00:07:06,506
Not good enough for him, is she?

60
00:07:06,506 --> 00:07:08,507
He start that earIy with me?

61
00:07:08,507 --> 00:07:10,463
You're a man. You can handIe it.

62
00:07:12,387 --> 00:07:13,908
Here.

63
00:07:13,908 --> 00:07:15,628
Better get used to it.

64
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:18,904
This one's going to need
someone to Iook out for her.

65
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,428
Yeah, aIright.

66
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,707
My Koro wished in his heart
that I'd never been born.

67
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,872
But he changed his mind.

68
00:08:41,284 --> 00:08:42,764
There!
Hey!

69
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,356
You old Paka!

70
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,158
Quick!

71
00:08:49,605 --> 00:08:51,085
Gee, they were quick.

72
00:08:51,085 --> 00:08:53,042
Must have Iet them off earIy.

73
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,848
You've been smoking.

74
00:09:03,848 --> 00:09:05,328
Says you!

75
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:07,648
Maori women have got to stop smoking.

76
00:09:07,648 --> 00:09:10,209
We've got to protect
our chiId-bearing properties.

77
00:09:12,849 --> 00:09:14,850
Are youse coming to the concert?

78
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,330
We might.

79
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:20,331
I bet she's got her best gears
all Iaid out on the bed.

80
00:09:20,331 --> 00:09:21,811
My dad's coming.

81
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,091
Better get my fIash dress out, then.

82
00:09:24,091 --> 00:09:26,092
How Iong's he staying this time?

83
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:28,372
Five minutes?
Longer than that.

84
00:09:28,372 --> 00:09:31,813
That's good, 'cause I bIinked
and missed him last time.

85
00:09:31,813 --> 00:09:34,053
What time's the concert, bub?

86
00:09:34,053 --> 00:09:35,534
7:30.

87
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:36,967
And don't be Iate.

88
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:39,606
Gee, she's bossy, that one.

89
00:09:41,255 --> 00:09:44,575
It wouId have to be smoking
in a pretty funny pIace

90
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:46,532
to wreck your chiId-bearing properties!

91
00:10:34,064 --> 00:10:36,945
No good to you, you reckon?
Shh!

92
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,194
What are they feeding you?

93
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:29,034
You Iook different.

94
00:11:29,034 --> 00:11:30,835
Oh, you do too.

95
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,515
You must be growing up.

96
00:11:32,515 --> 00:11:33,995
Am not.

97
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,476
Sorry I was Iate.

98
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:37,546
It doesn't matter.
We all stink anyway.

99
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:45,590
Oh!

100
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,635
Got to Iook my best for your brother.

101
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:05,041
Hey, bro.

102
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,601
Rawiri?

103
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,282
Good to see you, mate.

104
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:13,763
Yeah, put on a bit of weight
since I saw you last, eh?

105
00:12:13,763 --> 00:12:16,283
Yeah.
Hey, this is my new Iady.

106
00:12:16,283 --> 00:12:18,320
Kia-ora.
Oh, kia-ora.

107
00:12:21,564 --> 00:12:24,205
How many of my sons
do you need, girl?

108
00:12:24,205 --> 00:12:27,163
Give us a hand with the food.
Make yourseIf usefuI.

109
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,206
You too, Pai.
Come on, mate.

110
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:35,641
Let these important guys
have their taIk, eh?

111
00:12:56,491 --> 00:12:57,924
Take your time.

112
00:12:58,971 --> 00:13:00,689
They've been waiting for you.

113
00:13:11,813 --> 00:13:13,894
Been a whiIe this time, son.

114
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,327
Been away.

115
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:18,735
Didn't you get any of my postcards?

116
00:13:18,735 --> 00:13:21,135
Your mother put something
on the fridge.

117
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:24,256
I don't know what it was.
A bridge or something.

118
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:26,167
France probabIy.

119
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:32,537
I've been spending
a bit of time in Germany too.

120
00:13:32,537 --> 00:13:34,898
Like you there, do they?

121
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,536
Mmm, some of them do.

122
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:39,778
So you've been busy, then?

123
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,419
Yeah. Yeah, it's been good.

124
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:44,855
You know, I've got a gallery interested.
Had some good shows.

125
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,853
How about you?

126
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,974
We've been aIright.

127
00:13:59,502 --> 00:14:01,502
Well, it's good to see you, Dad.

128
00:14:24,147 --> 00:14:26,147
It was my father's waka.

129
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:29,788
But after I was born,
he didn't want to carve it anymore.

130
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:36,502
He went away.

131
00:14:38,189 --> 00:14:39,703
Everybody did.

132
00:14:47,071 --> 00:14:49,071
Sorry, Mum.
You've come a Iong way.

133
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:51,347
I think you can have a sIeep-in.

134
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,834
Isn't he having any breakfast?

135
00:15:02,834 --> 00:15:05,154
The septic tank's bIocked
down at the marae.

136
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,794
Can't somebody eIse do it?

137
00:15:06,794 --> 00:15:08,795
Eat your breakfast. You're too skinny.

138
00:15:08,795 --> 00:15:11,435
I can't hardIy see your bum
in those pants.

139
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:12,869
Thanks, Mum.

140
00:15:18,997 --> 00:15:20,430
Thanks, Mum.

141
00:15:21,477 --> 00:15:23,230
Your timing's spooky, boy.

142
00:15:41,161 --> 00:15:42,641
Ow!

143
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:44,121
What was that for?

144
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,802
For the concert last night.

145
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:47,758
You have more respect next time.

146
00:15:58,644 --> 00:16:01,565
That teacher of yours -
got herseIf a husband yet?

147
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,045
I don't think so.

148
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,684
She still got those things on her teeth?

149
00:16:13,967 --> 00:16:15,447
Paka.

150
00:16:15,447 --> 00:16:20,044
At schooI, we got to do a speech
on where we come from and that.

151
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:25,529
So anyway, you know how
we all came on a whale?

152
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:27,609
That's right.

153
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:29,726
But where does the whale come from?

154
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,250
From Hawaiki.

155
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,809
Where's that?

156
00:16:36,691 --> 00:16:39,011
It's where we Iived
before we came here,

157
00:16:39,011 --> 00:16:40,570
where the ancestors are.

158
00:16:41,732 --> 00:16:43,612
So Paikea came from there?

159
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:45,093
Aye.

160
00:16:45,093 --> 00:16:47,013
How Iong ago?

161
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:48,653
A Iong time.

162
00:16:48,653 --> 00:16:50,565
But how Iong?

163
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,295
See that there?

164
00:16:56,295 --> 00:16:57,728
Look at it cIoseIy.

165
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,849
What do you see?

166
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:07,137
Lots of IittIe bits of rope
all twisted together.

167
00:17:07,137 --> 00:17:08,617
That's right.

168
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:18,419
''Weave together the threads of Paikea

169
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:20,853
''so that our Iine remains strong.''

170
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:26,300
Each one of those threads
is one of your ancestors,

171
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,418
all joined together and strong.

172
00:17:30,821 --> 00:17:33,415
All the way back to that whale of yours.

173
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:40,696
Oh!

174
00:17:41,943 --> 00:17:43,934
UseIess bIoody rope.
I'll get another one.

175
00:18:11,668 --> 00:18:13,669
Paka!

176
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,102
Paka!

177
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:18,103
It's working!

178
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:21,983
It's working.

179
00:18:23,031 --> 00:18:26,351
I don't want you to do that again.

180
00:18:26,351 --> 00:18:27,784
It's dangerous.

181
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,593
That's a good one.

182
00:19:26,842 --> 00:19:28,276
Come in.

183
00:19:29,483 --> 00:19:31,483
There's a seat for you over there.

184
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,963
Kia-ora.
Kia-ora.

185
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,397
Hi.
Kia-ora.

186
00:19:35,604 --> 00:19:37,724
Have you met Pai's father?

187
00:19:37,724 --> 00:19:40,805
Porourangi, this is Miss Parata
from the schooI.

188
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,285
Kia-ora.

189
00:19:42,285 --> 00:19:43,765
Kia-ora.

190
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,766
I thought she'd appreciate
seeing the show.

191
00:19:45,766 --> 00:19:47,246
No probIem.

192
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:50,207
Uh, this is some of my work

193
00:19:50,207 --> 00:19:52,727
from my last exhibition in Germany.

194
00:19:52,727 --> 00:19:55,168
Start again from the beginning.

195
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:57,238
She wants to see all of it.

196
00:19:58,928 --> 00:20:00,361
AIright.

197
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,810
Yeah, Iike I was saying, uh...

198
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,290
Oh, sorry!

199
00:20:09,290 --> 00:20:10,723
Who's that, bro?

200
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:17,968
Anne. It's a woman I've been seeing.

201
00:20:20,492 --> 00:20:22,210
Actually, she's pregnant.

202
00:20:24,773 --> 00:20:26,206
We're expecting a chiId.

203
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,974
Why didn't you tell me?

204
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:30,454
CongratuIations, bro.

205
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:32,454
You aIways get the good-Iooking ones.

206
00:20:32,454 --> 00:20:34,775
Where is she?
Why didn't you bring her?

207
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,775
Uh, she Iives in Germany, Mum.

208
00:20:36,775 --> 00:20:39,096
She wanted to have the chiId at home.

209
00:20:39,096 --> 00:20:41,416
You'll bring her back here?
Yeah, of course.

210
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:44,693
Well, a bit of a visit
when the baby gets big.

211
00:20:50,578 --> 00:20:53,615
Rawiri, take Miss Parata back to town.

212
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:01,773
Come with me, Pai.

213
00:21:12,182 --> 00:21:14,182
When were you going to tell me?

214
00:21:14,182 --> 00:21:15,662
The day you Ieft?

215
00:21:15,662 --> 00:21:18,621
I've been trying to tell you
since I got here.

216
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,343
Look, Dad, it's not forever.

217
00:21:21,343 --> 00:21:23,664
It's just...
Well, it's Anne's first chiId.

218
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,664
You know, her work's there.
Her famiIy.

219
00:21:25,664 --> 00:21:27,144
FamiIy?
Yeah.

220
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:30,785
I can't expect her to move
to the other side of the worId.

221
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:33,106
Don't you use that girl as an excuse.

222
00:21:33,106 --> 00:21:36,426
You can't wait to get away.
I see it in you.

223
00:21:36,426 --> 00:21:40,427
You never stay because it hurts you
to see what's happening to us.

224
00:21:40,427 --> 00:21:41,907
Yeah, it does.

225
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:44,348
You can still waIk away from it.

226
00:21:44,348 --> 00:21:46,988
Leave that waka of yours
out there to rot!

227
00:21:46,988 --> 00:21:48,988
So I'm not here shovelling shit.

228
00:21:48,988 --> 00:21:50,989
But, Dad, I'm doing my share.

229
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,989
Oh, did you even see my work?

230
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:55,310
Did you...did you even Iook at it?

231
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,790
You call it work!

232
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,910
It's not work. It's souvenirs.

233
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:01,431
Those young men
you turn your back on,

234
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,431
they've got something
to Iearn from you.

235
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:05,111
You've got something to offer.

236
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:06,592
Don't you turn away!

237
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,512
Yeah, you got the priviIeges.

238
00:22:08,512 --> 00:22:11,346
But you forget,
you've aIso got the obIigations.

239
00:22:16,273 --> 00:22:17,707
Look at me, Dad.

240
00:22:18,914 --> 00:22:20,870
For once in your Iife. Go on.

241
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:29,196
No, you don't even know who I am.

242
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:33,317
I know who you're meant to be,
who you were born to be.

243
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:36,797
Oh, yeah. Right.
But I faiIed you, eh, Dad?

244
00:22:36,797 --> 00:22:40,438
Yeah. Because why? I had a daughter?
I'm probabIy having another daughter.

245
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:43,438
And you're not treating
another chiId of mine Iike that.

246
00:22:43,438 --> 00:22:47,439
Then take her with you
if you don't Iike the job I'm doing!

247
00:22:47,439 --> 00:22:48,919
Go on, take her!

248
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,354
Stop it!
She's no use to me.

249
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,481
Pai!

250
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:58,441
No, Ieave it. I'll get her.

251
00:22:58,441 --> 00:22:59,556
Pai!

252
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,723
You aIright?

253
00:23:49,171 --> 00:23:50,971
Got to watch that Koro sometimes.

254
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,491
Big mouth of his gets away on him, eh?

255
00:23:53,491 --> 00:23:57,531
He didn't mean it...about me.

256
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:02,251
Well...you know...

257
00:24:03,613 --> 00:24:05,570
Maybe we shouId think about it.

258
00:24:07,174 --> 00:24:09,130
Think about what?

259
00:24:10,374 --> 00:24:13,128
You coming to Iive with me for a whiIe.

260
00:24:19,536 --> 00:24:20,969
What do you think?

261
00:24:23,097 --> 00:24:24,857
Why doesn't he want me?

262
00:24:24,857 --> 00:24:27,138
Oh, Pai, it's not you.

263
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:29,378
It's not even about you, in a way.

264
00:24:29,378 --> 00:24:34,659
Koro is just...he's just Iooking for
something that doesn't exist anymore.

265
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:36,092
A new leader?

266
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:38,660
They exist.

267
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,260
Yeah, they do,

268
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,541
except I think it's become
even more than that.

269
00:24:44,541 --> 00:24:47,221
In his head,
your Koro, he needs a prophet.

270
00:24:47,221 --> 00:24:48,700
What's that?

271
00:24:52,462 --> 00:24:56,063
Well, somebody who's gonna
Iead our peopIe out of the darkness

272
00:24:56,063 --> 00:24:58,736
and who'll make everything
aIright again.

273
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:03,544
OnIy probIem is you can't
just decide who those peopIe are

274
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,105
just because you want them to be, eh?

275
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,016
Like my brother?

276
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,217
Yeah.

277
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,628
Your Koro made himseIf
beIieve so strongIy

278
00:25:23,628 --> 00:25:25,539
that he was gonna be the one.

279
00:25:26,828 --> 00:25:28,262
But what if he was?

280
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,987
And what if he wasn't?

281
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,824
You know, your Koro
did the same thing with me.

282
00:25:43,952 --> 00:25:46,147
Is that why he's so hard on you?

283
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:49,549
Yep, pretty much.

284
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:53,708
Because I can't be what he wants, eh?

285
00:25:56,834 --> 00:25:58,347
Me neither.

286
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:14,154
You think about it, OK?

287
00:26:16,078 --> 00:26:18,038
You know,
you'd make me really happy

288
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:19,949
if you'd come and stay with me.

289
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,712
Just think about it.

290
00:26:45,443 --> 00:26:48,323
Ready, Pai?
One more go.

291
00:26:48,323 --> 00:26:50,599
You be good to that girl.

292
00:28:25,141 --> 00:28:26,939
That's right, you Iook.

293
00:28:30,622 --> 00:28:33,303
I'm gonna need all the firstborn boys.

294
00:28:33,303 --> 00:28:34,903
It's time they Iearnt.

295
00:28:34,903 --> 00:28:36,383
Learnt what?

296
00:28:36,383 --> 00:28:40,457
When she was born,
that's when things went wrong for us.

297
00:28:41,824 --> 00:28:44,339
That's where we'll find the answer.

298
00:29:06,669 --> 00:29:08,102
You aIright?

299
00:30:03,199 --> 00:30:04,633
Stop the car.

300
00:30:14,721 --> 00:30:16,155
Pai?

301
00:30:20,242 --> 00:30:21,676
What is it, Pai?

302
00:30:27,284 --> 00:30:28,964
Can we go home now?

303
00:30:28,964 --> 00:30:30,875
But why? What is it? What's wrong?

304
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:33,885
I have to go home.

305
00:30:33,885 --> 00:30:35,398
But why?

306
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:38,239
I just have to.

307
00:30:41,446 --> 00:30:43,447
I know.

308
00:30:43,447 --> 00:30:45,039
Here, it's OK.

309
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:57,409
KORO: There is some discussion
that we...

310
00:30:57,409 --> 00:30:59,410
Paka!

311
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:01,287
I'm back.

312
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,251
Not now, Pai.

313
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:07,371
But I'm back.

314
00:31:07,371 --> 00:31:09,043
I'm back.

315
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:17,493
Anyway...where does
that information come from?

316
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:20,770
It comes from the books and our...

317
00:31:37,137 --> 00:31:38,697
You shouIdn't be smoking.

318
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:40,653
Trying to give up, aren't I?

319
00:31:42,498 --> 00:31:44,898
How come you didn't go with your dad?

320
00:31:44,898 --> 00:31:47,458
I did.
Hmm, for one day.

321
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,219
I wouId've gone.

322
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:52,659
When my dad gets out,
I'm gonna go with him.

323
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:53,809
Where?

324
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,180
Wherever. Get out of this dump.

325
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,541
Koro's gonna be pissed off
when he sees you smoking.

326
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,901
No, he won't, 'cause he's not coming.

327
00:32:02,901 --> 00:32:04,742
Is so.
No.

328
00:32:04,742 --> 00:32:06,380
He's getting the schooI ready.

329
00:32:07,782 --> 00:32:08,822
What schooI?

330
00:32:08,822 --> 00:32:11,823
For us fellas, to teach us
the old ways and that.

331
00:32:11,823 --> 00:32:14,303
ProbabIy gonna be a stink.

332
00:32:16,104 --> 00:32:18,624
You can come on the bus if you want.

333
00:32:18,624 --> 00:32:20,104
I'm waiting for Koro.

334
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,699
But he's not coming.
I said I'm waiting.

335
00:32:55,671 --> 00:32:57,151
When you're ready.

336
00:32:57,151 --> 00:32:59,152
When everyone's here, I'll be ready.

337
00:32:59,152 --> 00:33:00,712
They are here.

338
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:02,792
Those boys have waited haIf an hour.

339
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:05,033
You tell her you weren't picking her up?

340
00:33:05,033 --> 00:33:07,793
She couId've come on the bus.

341
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:12,231
You pick her up every day for years
and she's just supposed to guess?

342
00:33:24,676 --> 00:33:27,032
Good. Let's go.

343
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:36,878
Do the weIcome, bub.

344
00:33:38,999 --> 00:33:40,432
Go on.

345
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,320
What do you think you're doing?

346
00:34:47,372 --> 00:34:50,284
Pai, you're a girl. Go to the back.

347
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:59,564
What did I say?

348
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:08,448
What did I say?!

349
00:35:15,017 --> 00:35:16,450
Then Ieave.

350
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:19,971
Go on!

351
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,934
For you boys...

352
00:35:39,141 --> 00:35:42,262
..this will be
a sacred schooI of Iearning.

353
00:35:42,262 --> 00:35:48,183
You'll be taught in the old ways
in all the quaIities of a chief.

354
00:35:48,183 --> 00:35:51,903
You will be tested for your strength,

355
00:35:51,903 --> 00:35:57,183
your courage, your intelligence
and your leadership.

356
00:35:59,585 --> 00:36:01,585
KORO: Paikea's canoe sank

357
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:04,498
and he called on
the ancient ones for strength.

358
00:36:05,546 --> 00:36:08,626
You're going to Iearn that chant,
all of you,

359
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:10,467
Iearn it exactIy.

360
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:14,427
And if you break the chant,
you will suffer the utu.

361
00:36:21,709 --> 00:36:23,469
The consequences.

362
00:36:23,469 --> 00:36:26,110
Like what?
Someone dying or something?

363
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,390
Like your dick'll drop off.

364
00:36:31,031 --> 00:36:32,871
So hold onto your dicks.

365
00:36:34,471 --> 00:36:36,508
Enough! Hold onto your dick!

366
00:36:38,752 --> 00:36:41,790
Now...repeat after me.

367
00:37:02,316 --> 00:37:04,467
The taiaha is an instrument of war...

368
00:37:06,197 --> 00:37:07,755
..a tooI for fighting.

369
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:13,310
If you want to master it,
you've got to show it respect.

370
00:37:18,479 --> 00:37:20,357
Hemi, here.

371
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,956
Pick it up.

372
00:37:47,925 --> 00:37:49,405
Good.

373
00:37:49,405 --> 00:37:51,405
Be angry.

374
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:53,166
Anger's part of your battIe.

375
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,846
You got to Iearn to controI it.

376
00:37:55,846 --> 00:37:58,315
Now, take a break, get a drink of water.

377
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:08,605
KORO: The rest of you in pairs.

378
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,569
Koro know you're doing that?

379
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:15,570
I'm not doing anything.

380
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,526
How come you're hiding
round here, then?

381
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:21,611
Koro's cooI, eh?

382
00:38:21,611 --> 00:38:24,000
He's teaching us to be warriors, man.

383
00:38:25,652 --> 00:38:27,732
Gonna be chiefs.

384
00:38:27,732 --> 00:38:30,041
Gonna smack all those other ones.

385
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:33,253
You shouIdn't have hit Koro Iike that.

386
00:38:33,253 --> 00:38:36,254
He was aIright. He was reaI patient, eh?

387
00:38:36,254 --> 00:38:38,814
How come he won't Iet you do it?

388
00:38:38,814 --> 00:38:40,574
girls aren't allowed.

389
00:38:40,574 --> 00:38:43,935
You couId sit up the back
as Iong as you were quiet.

390
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:45,368
I wouIdn't mind.

391
00:38:48,216 --> 00:38:49,888
You're not even holding it right.

392
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,335
Your hands shouId be Iike this.

393
00:38:54,777 --> 00:38:56,210
And your feet...

394
00:38:57,297 --> 00:38:58,731
..Iike this.

395
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:04,697
Go back to the schooI, Hemi.

396
00:39:05,979 --> 00:39:07,412
I said go.

397
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,857
I'll deaI with you Iater.

398
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,783
I'm sorry, Paka.

399
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,226
Have you gone deaf now?

400
00:39:42,226 --> 00:39:44,226
Somebody just apoIogised to you.

401
00:39:44,226 --> 00:39:47,147
You don't mess around
with sacred things!

402
00:39:47,147 --> 00:39:49,786
She was just watching!
She was using a taiaha!

403
00:39:54,668 --> 00:39:56,148
Let the girl do it.

404
00:39:56,148 --> 00:40:00,069
You might be the boss out there,
but I'm the boss of this kitchen.

405
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:01,502
I'll do it.

406
00:41:11,282 --> 00:41:12,920
You forgot something.

407
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,714
Hey, it's not too bad up here.

408
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:28,885
He's got a Iot of ruIes he has to Iive by.

409
00:41:28,885 --> 00:41:31,246
It's not fair.

410
00:41:31,246 --> 00:41:32,726
I know.

411
00:41:32,726 --> 00:41:36,727
But sometimes, you just got to
Iet him think that he's the boss.

412
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:38,922
He is the boss.
Well, not of me.

413
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,758
I Iet him think he is, though.

414
00:41:44,488 --> 00:41:46,089
What's wrong with me, Nanny?

415
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,449
Nothing's wrong with you,
you hear me?

416
00:41:48,449 --> 00:41:51,249
You got the bIood of Muriwai
in your veins, girl.

417
00:41:51,249 --> 00:41:54,162
Think she'd be proud of you
saying things Iike that?

418
00:41:57,611 --> 00:42:01,570
And anyway, that old Paka's not
the onIy one who knows some tricks.

419
00:42:02,772 --> 00:42:04,252
Hey?

420
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:08,693
Well, you wouIdn't know it now,
but before he got fat and ugIy,

421
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:12,733
your UncIe Rawiri
was a bit of a hot shot with the taiaha.

422
00:42:12,733 --> 00:42:15,294
True?
Won a trophy and everything.

423
00:42:16,374 --> 00:42:18,134
Oh, you shouId've seen him.

424
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:20,444
He was beautifuI.

425
00:42:22,695 --> 00:42:24,176
What happened?

426
00:42:24,176 --> 00:42:25,856
Oh, I don't know.

427
00:42:25,856 --> 00:42:27,733
He was the second son.

428
00:42:29,697 --> 00:42:32,497
But he knows some things,
your UncIe Rawiri.

429
00:42:32,497 --> 00:42:34,453
Don't you worry about that.

430
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,976
Is UncIe here?
Out the back.

431
00:42:53,901 --> 00:42:55,334
Come on!

432
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,383
Hi.

433
00:43:02,383 --> 00:43:06,503
Damn, girl! What did I tell you
about sneaking up on us?

434
00:43:06,503 --> 00:43:08,415
I found this.

435
00:43:11,224 --> 00:43:13,305
I didn't know you pIayed goIf.

436
00:43:13,305 --> 00:43:16,065
Not goIf, taiaha.

437
00:43:16,065 --> 00:43:18,746
Yeah, well, this guy's pIaying goIf.

438
00:43:18,746 --> 00:43:21,306
They cut the end off the goIf stick,

439
00:43:21,306 --> 00:43:24,787
swing it around
and push it through there.

440
00:43:29,147 --> 00:43:31,508
Hey, shut up! I was good.

441
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:33,468
That's why you're here
whiIe your father

442
00:43:33,468 --> 00:43:35,709
tells snotty-nosed kids
how to be chief.

443
00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:39,829
Poor IittIe bastards, eh?

444
00:43:39,829 --> 00:43:41,950
CouId you teach me?

445
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,510
Hold up.

446
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:45,590
This was a Iong time ago.

447
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,071
So?

448
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,062
PIease.

449
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,152
Does Koro know about this?

450
00:43:52,152 --> 00:43:53,585
No.

451
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,993
Well, Iet's get it on, then, eh?

452
00:43:57,993 --> 00:43:59,553
Yes!

453
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:03,434
You mean this?

454
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:05,072
It's a broom, isn't it?

455
00:44:40,881 --> 00:44:42,441
Whoo-hoo.

456
00:44:57,844 --> 00:44:59,277
Morning, Dad.

457
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:11,486
Hey, there goes that IittIe girl Pai.

458
00:45:27,609 --> 00:45:30,249
Go, IittIe girl. Here.

459
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,570
Come on, get him, Pai.

460
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:35,004
Come on.

461
00:45:36,891 --> 00:45:38,451
Go, Pai!

462
00:45:38,451 --> 00:45:40,488
Get him, girl.

463
00:45:49,373 --> 00:45:51,171
When you extend your tongue...

464
00:45:53,134 --> 00:45:54,772
..you're saying to your enemies...

465
00:45:56,014 --> 00:46:00,655
..''I'm gonna eat you...
your eyes will roll back...

466
00:46:00,655 --> 00:46:03,693
''..your head will be stuck
on the end of my stick.''

467
00:46:07,217 --> 00:46:08,696
FeeI the ihi...

468
00:46:11,177 --> 00:46:12,816
..the power.

469
00:46:14,098 --> 00:46:17,807
Make them feeI the wehi...the fear.

470
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:23,619
I want the hairs
on the backs of their necks to stand up.

471
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,453
Take off your shirts.

472
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,019
KUTERE!

473
00:46:33,341 --> 00:46:35,139
When you sIap your chests...

474
00:46:36,462 --> 00:46:38,737
..I want you to sIap them hard.

475
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:45,624
Scratch them, make them bIeed.

476
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:47,455
Timita.

477
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:18,143
Good, Hemi. Good.

478
00:47:18,310 --> 00:47:22,070
It's not just your fathers
that are watching you today.

479
00:47:22,070 --> 00:47:24,904
All these ancestors are watching too.

480
00:47:28,752 --> 00:47:30,185
This is my dad.

481
00:47:43,954 --> 00:47:45,955
Come to see your boy?

482
00:47:45,955 --> 00:47:47,595
Yeah.

483
00:47:47,595 --> 00:47:49,075
Good.

484
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:50,987
Hemi, you first.

485
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:24,357
Ha!

486
00:48:25,562 --> 00:48:26,517
Ha!

487
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:33,003
girl, where's that schooI?

488
00:48:33,003 --> 00:48:34,484
Over there.

489
00:48:57,128 --> 00:48:59,088
Thought you'd stay for the whoIe thing.

490
00:48:59,088 --> 00:49:00,768
I seen your bit, didn't I?

491
00:49:00,768 --> 00:49:02,646
Come and meet my mates.

492
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,163
Here's my boy.

493
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,290
Say hello.
Hello.

494
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:13,211
Better watch out for this one.

495
00:49:13,211 --> 00:49:14,883
Did aIright in there, eh?

496
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:18,652
See you Iater.

497
00:49:18,652 --> 00:49:21,052
Tonight?

498
00:49:21,052 --> 00:49:22,804
Next coupIe of days maybe.

499
00:49:26,533 --> 00:49:27,966
Jump in, boy.

500
00:49:29,854 --> 00:49:31,287
We're out of here.

501
00:49:55,779 --> 00:49:57,859
Get Iost, you.

502
00:49:57,859 --> 00:49:59,815
Was that your dad?

503
00:50:00,859 --> 00:50:02,340
Get Iost.

504
00:50:32,945 --> 00:50:34,425
What have you done?

505
00:50:36,946 --> 00:50:38,379
Answer me.

506
00:50:40,387 --> 00:50:41,820
It wasn't her fauIt.

507
00:50:43,147 --> 00:50:45,184
Go wash your face.

508
00:50:51,389 --> 00:50:52,869
Answer me, Pai.

509
00:50:52,869 --> 00:50:55,189
Do you know what you've done?

510
00:50:55,189 --> 00:50:56,670
No.

511
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:01,551
You've broken the tapu of this schooI,
on this marae.

512
00:51:01,551 --> 00:51:05,791
The one pIace
where our old ways are upheId.

513
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:09,952
The knowIedge that's been
passed down from your ancestors,

514
00:51:09,952 --> 00:51:13,793
from my grandfather to me
to those boys.

515
00:51:13,793 --> 00:51:16,393
It's broken!

516
00:51:16,393 --> 00:51:18,703
I'm sorry, Paka.

517
00:51:20,314 --> 00:51:21,872
You're not sorry.

518
00:51:25,675 --> 00:51:28,516
Right from the beginning,
you knew this wasn't for you.

519
00:51:28,516 --> 00:51:30,234
But you keep coming back.

520
00:51:31,276 --> 00:51:33,637
Do you want me to faiI?
No.

521
00:51:33,637 --> 00:51:35,946
You want these boys to faiI?

522
00:51:38,397 --> 00:51:40,638
What have you got to say to them?

523
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:42,678
I'm sorry.

524
00:51:42,678 --> 00:51:45,679
Say it again.
I'm sorry.

525
00:51:45,679 --> 00:51:47,271
Say it so you mean it!

526
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:51,439
Say it!

527
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:54,436
I'm sorry.

528
00:52:07,443 --> 00:52:09,723
Want me to put some more hot in?

529
00:52:09,723 --> 00:52:11,523
No.

530
00:52:11,523 --> 00:52:12,957
Ow.

531
00:52:15,084 --> 00:52:17,645
You can get sick sitting in a cold bath.

532
00:52:24,246 --> 00:52:26,086
What if he faiIs, Nanny?

533
00:52:26,086 --> 00:52:27,566
Then he faiIs.

534
00:52:27,566 --> 00:52:30,047
And what will happen to him?

535
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:31,527
Nothing will happen.

536
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:34,928
Except me thinking about that divorce.

537
00:52:36,928 --> 00:52:38,809
It's not Koro's fauIt, Nanny.

538
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:41,169
What's not his fauIt?

539
00:52:41,169 --> 00:52:42,966
Sounds Iike his fauIt to me.

540
00:52:44,009 --> 00:52:45,807
Not that I'm a girl.

541
00:53:00,012 --> 00:53:01,446
Not you, Hemi.

542
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:39,580
You've all done very well.

543
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,860
You've shown me
that you've got courage,

544
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,898
that you're strong
and that you can Iearn.

545
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,381
But there can onIy be one.

546
00:53:48,381 --> 00:53:50,498
So there's one finaI test.

547
00:53:52,502 --> 00:53:54,220
A test of your spirit.

548
00:54:01,424 --> 00:54:03,944
''If you have the tooth of a whale,

549
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:06,903
''you must have the whale's jaw
to wieId it.''

550
00:54:18,907 --> 00:54:21,341
One of you will bring that back to me.

551
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:38,270
Bubba's got a cold and I can't swim.

552
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,023
It's aIright, mate.

553
00:54:59,834 --> 00:55:01,268
Oi!

554
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:24,239
Give it to me.

555
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,672
I aImost had it.

556
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:21,373
Nanny?

557
00:57:37,343 --> 00:57:38,777
Come here.

558
00:57:44,145 --> 00:57:45,737
It's not for Iong.

559
00:58:18,351 --> 00:58:20,228
You can put your cIothes in there.

560
00:58:22,312 --> 00:58:25,190
And there's a Iamp if you want to read.

561
00:58:27,993 --> 00:58:29,790
Rawiri reckons
you're pretty brainy, eh?

562
00:58:34,274 --> 00:58:35,707
Anyway...

563
00:58:36,754 --> 00:58:38,393
..it's just for a IittIe whiIe.

564
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:28,842
He was calling to the ancient
ones, asking them to heIp him.

565
00:59:30,284 --> 00:59:31,797
But they weren't Iistening.

566
00:59:36,725 --> 00:59:38,159
So I tried.

567
01:00:02,650 --> 01:00:04,130
And they heard me.

568
01:01:12,143 --> 01:01:16,264
UncIe, is this where Paka
Iost his rei puta?

569
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:17,264
His what?

570
01:01:17,264 --> 01:01:21,225
That thing he wore round his neck.
He threw it overboard.

571
01:01:21,225 --> 01:01:22,985
Crazy old bugger.

572
01:01:22,985 --> 01:01:24,896
Where?

573
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,426
It was just over there.

574
01:01:27,426 --> 01:01:29,144
I'll get it.

575
01:01:42,188 --> 01:01:43,907
PAI: It's quiet down deep.

576
01:01:45,149 --> 01:01:46,869
Koro needed quiet.

577
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:49,338
That's what Nanny said.

578
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,342
He didn't want to taIk anymore.

579
01:01:56,471 --> 01:01:58,905
He just wanted to go down and down.

580
01:02:19,715 --> 01:02:21,593
She's been gone quite a whiIe, eh?

581
01:02:23,236 --> 01:02:24,669
No, she's sweet.

582
01:02:59,323 --> 01:03:00,278
Oh!

583
01:03:01,323 --> 01:03:02,803
For Paka's tea.

584
01:03:02,803 --> 01:03:04,236
And I found this.

585
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:18,166
Got this for Dad's tea.
LoveIy. Pop it in the sink.

586
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:20,122
Pai got it.

587
01:03:27,448 --> 01:03:29,128
She got this as well.

588
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:42,931
You gonna tell him?

589
01:03:42,931 --> 01:03:44,731
No.

590
01:03:44,731 --> 01:03:46,926
He's not ready yet.

591
01:04:11,856 --> 01:04:13,289
Go on.

592
01:04:29,259 --> 01:04:31,011
It's for my schooI concert.

593
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:36,653
You're my guest of honour.

594
01:04:46,582 --> 01:04:48,380
So I'll see you there, Paka.

595
01:05:10,427 --> 01:05:12,861
Come on. I want to get up the front.

596
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:22,949
Save this one for Paka.

597
01:05:22,949 --> 01:05:24,829
He might be heId up, bub.

598
01:05:24,829 --> 01:05:26,786
No, he's coming.

599
01:06:02,556 --> 01:06:06,717
SONG: ? There is a train
that Ieaves tonight

600
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:10,558
? Get on board
Now, I just might

601
01:06:10,558 --> 01:06:14,598
? I'm sick of all
these dead-end days

602
01:06:14,598 --> 01:06:18,877
? Take one ticket and be away

603
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,920
? The driver knows the road to take

604
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:28,801
? The engineer disconnects the brake

605
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:30,881
? Just pack your bags

606
01:06:30,881 --> 01:06:33,042
? Check in your cross

607
01:06:33,042 --> 01:06:37,116
? 'Cause no-one there
is gonna see you run

608
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:41,243
? I couId've fIown

609
01:06:41,243 --> 01:06:43,439
? I couId've saiIed... ?

610
01:08:06,419 --> 01:08:08,419
Thank you, Iadies and gentIemen.

611
01:08:08,419 --> 01:08:11,940
Now to finish,
we have something very speciaI.

612
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:14,020
One of our students has won

613
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:16,581
not onIy our own
schooI speech contest,

614
01:08:16,581 --> 01:08:19,701
but the East Coast Area SchooI's
as well.

615
01:08:19,701 --> 01:08:24,142
Ladies and gentIemen,
pIease weIcome Miss Paikea Apirana.

616
01:08:29,423 --> 01:08:31,062
Did you know about this?

617
01:08:32,224 --> 01:08:33,864
She said she had a surprise.

618
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:35,616
For him.

619
01:08:45,906 --> 01:08:48,987
This speech is a token
of my deep love and respect

620
01:08:48,987 --> 01:08:50,587
for Koro Apirana.

621
01:08:50,587 --> 01:08:52,783
My grandfather.

622
01:09:02,669 --> 01:09:04,900
My name is Paikea Apirana.

623
01:09:15,712 --> 01:09:18,146
Go on, bub.

624
01:09:25,754 --> 01:09:28,274
And I come from a Iong Iine of chiefs

625
01:09:28,274 --> 01:09:30,234
stretching all the way back to Hawaiki

626
01:09:30,234 --> 01:09:31,915
where our ancient ones are,

627
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:35,235
the ones that first heard
the Iand crying and sent a man.

628
01:09:35,235 --> 01:09:36,954
His name was aIso Paikea...

629
01:09:39,556 --> 01:09:42,151
..and I'm his most recent descendant.

630
01:09:44,877 --> 01:09:47,758
But I was not the leader
my grandfather was expecting.

631
01:09:47,758 --> 01:09:52,070
And by being born, I broke the Iine
back to the ancient ones.

632
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:56,512
It wasn't anybody's fauIt.
It just happened.

633
01:11:06,972 --> 01:11:10,453
But we can Iearn, and if the knowIedge
is given to everyone,

634
01:11:10,453 --> 01:11:12,413
then we can have Iots of leaders.

635
01:11:12,413 --> 01:11:14,494
And soon everyone will be strong,

636
01:11:14,494 --> 01:11:16,934
not just the ones
that have been chosen.

637
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:18,854
Because sometimes,
even if you're the leader

638
01:11:18,854 --> 01:11:20,535
and you need to be strong,

639
01:11:20,535 --> 01:11:23,003
you can get tired...

640
01:11:28,816 --> 01:11:30,577
..Iike our ancestor Paikea,

641
01:11:30,577 --> 01:11:33,897
when he was Iost at sea
and he couIdn't find the Iand

642
01:11:33,897 --> 01:11:35,578
and he probabIy wanted to die,

643
01:11:35,578 --> 01:11:38,298
but he knew the ancient ones
were there for him.

644
01:11:38,298 --> 01:11:41,939
So he called to them to Iift
him up and give him strength.

645
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:45,488
This is his chant.
I dedicate it to my grandfather.

646
01:14:22,678 --> 01:14:26,082
I called them and they came...

647
01:14:26,082 --> 01:14:27,755
..but it wasn't right.

648
01:14:30,806 --> 01:14:32,408
They were dying.

649
01:15:05,363 --> 01:15:07,595
Hey, keep away from the bIowhoIe.

650
01:15:13,251 --> 01:15:14,686
OK?

651
01:16:07,989 --> 01:16:10,352
Koro knew what it meant.

652
01:16:10,352 --> 01:16:12,834
It was Paikea's whale...

653
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:16,038
..sent to us
because we were in troubIe.

654
01:17:01,645 --> 01:17:03,239
Dad.

655
01:17:08,012 --> 01:17:10,655
We've got to turn it around.
How?

656
01:17:10,655 --> 01:17:15,450
Get a tractor down here, some ropes.
We'll wait for the tide.

657
01:17:17,742 --> 01:17:21,136
If...if we can move it,
the others will follow.

658
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:28,274
Get the men.

659
01:17:28,274 --> 01:17:32,351
They're stuffed.
HaIf of them have been up all night.

660
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,599
They'll do it for you.

661
01:17:46,292 --> 01:17:47,774
It was a test...

662
01:17:49,096 --> 01:17:51,328
..but for Koro this time.

663
01:17:56,183 --> 01:17:57,617
Leave it.

664
01:18:00,307 --> 01:18:01,742
You've done enough.

665
01:18:59,370 --> 01:19:01,412
Now!

666
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:57,462
He wanted to die.

667
01:19:59,313 --> 01:20:01,954
There wasn't a reason to Iive
anymore.

668
01:20:05,319 --> 01:20:07,121
RAWIRI: It's no use.

669
01:20:07,121 --> 01:20:09,684
They're too tired.
We'll try again Iater.

670
01:20:09,684 --> 01:20:11,165
Let them rest.

671
01:20:11,165 --> 01:20:14,241
Come on, dear. We'll come back.

672
01:22:59,583 --> 01:23:01,017
Come on.

673
01:23:51,517 --> 01:23:52,952
It's gone.

674
01:23:57,324 --> 01:23:58,758
Where is she?

675
01:24:01,928 --> 01:24:04,685
Where's my moko?

676
01:24:07,854 --> 01:24:09,893
Where is she?

677
01:24:14,342 --> 01:24:17,303
Pai!

678
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,698
It's OK, Paka.

679
01:25:18,529 --> 01:25:20,532
I wasn't scared to die.

680
01:25:41,514 --> 01:25:44,793
Hurry up! Hurry!

681
01:26:28,683 --> 01:26:30,118
Which one?

682
01:26:32,447 --> 01:26:34,758
What do you mean, 'which one'?

683
01:28:29,611 --> 01:28:31,045
Yes?

684
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,593
Thank you, dear.

685
01:29:04,167 --> 01:29:07,250
I've been praying to God about it.

686
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,853
If that IittIe one wakes up,

687
01:29:09,853 --> 01:29:12,616
I'm going to give up the smokes.

688
01:29:12,616 --> 01:29:14,256
She'd Iike that.

689
01:33:14,511 --> 01:33:16,993
My name is Paikea Apirana

690
01:33:16,993 --> 01:33:19,597
and I come from a Iong Iine of chiefs

691
01:33:19,597 --> 01:33:22,559
stretching all the way back
to the whale rider.

692
01:33:26,364 --> 01:33:27,965
I'm not a prophet,

693
01:33:27,965 --> 01:33:31,489
but I know that our peopIe
will keep going forward

694
01:33:31,489 --> 01:33:35,814
all together, with all of our strength.
