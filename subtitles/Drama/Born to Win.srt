1
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,915
They say I'm a charmer.
I charm my hustles.

2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,117
Well, that comes
after dealing with women.

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,516
After hairdressing.

4
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,600
I love to dress hair.

5
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,840
I kind of think of myself as an artist.

6
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,715
I treat people the way most people
don't treat 'em and they give me respect.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,834
No matter if I have my hand
in their pocket.

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,072
But being I know what to do, you know,
being hip enough to know, I do it.

9
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,592
It's love and peace. Love and peace.

10
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:23,715
You just gotta keep sending it out.
Love and peace. Love that love and peace.

11
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,876
I'm not J for nothing.

12
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,118
- Excuse me, ma'am? Where's the safe?
- What?

13
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,676
- We're here for the safe.
- Does Harry know about this?

14
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,673
Harry phoned and said pick up the safe.
It's behind the cash register.

15
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,155
I don't know anything about a safe.

16
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,113
I made a special trip up here
with the schvartze.

17
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,438
Harry didn't tell me anything about it.

18
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,393
- Harry didn't tell you anything about it?
- No.

19
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,036
OK. Come on.
Harry didn't tell her anything about it.

20
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,153
If Harry didn't tell you about it,
then you explain it to Harry.

21
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,874
Wait a minute, mister. Come back.

22
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,992
Harry doesn't always tell me everything.
I only work here part-time.

23
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,079
- My husband just had an operation.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

24
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:28,829
- He had a growth in his rear end.
- That can be painful.

25
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,508
Lays around the house all day
complaining.

26
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,474
- Get me this, get me that.
- Have you tried an enema?

27
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,198
Mister, the last thing in the world
my husband needs now is an enema.

28
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,994
I meant you. Have you tried an enema?

29
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:48,955
Me? Have I tried an enema?
Are you kidding?

30
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,757
Have I tried an enema? You gotta
be crazy! Have I tried an enema?

31
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,111
- Goodbye, darling.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.

32
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,198
- Hey, what about Harry?
- What about Harry?

33
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,472
- What shall I tell him?
- Tell him to take an enema.

34
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,952
- Hey, Harry.
- What is it?

35
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,355
The guys just picked up the safe.

36
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,718
What?

37
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,715
Stop that man! Help!
Stop that man! Police! Police!

38
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,673
J!

39
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,034
Hi.

40
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:09,919
- Hi.
- Can I have a lift?

41
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,879
- Where are you going?
- Home.

42
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,599
- Where's home?
- It's not very far.

43
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,990
Get in.

44
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,515
You really have a lot of keys.

45
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,874
- My goodness. This your car?
- Yeah.

46
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,269
- A lot of plastic.
- Yeah.

47
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,109
I asked for leather all over here
and they gave me vinyl.

48
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,753
Right.

49
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,678
But it's better to have a car
than not to have a car.

50
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,438
That's true.

51
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,315
Would you, er? Would you like a key?

52
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,436
- I'll bet this is your car.
- Right.

53
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,712
Do you want the key that starts the car
or do you?

54
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,559
No, I prefer the challenge.

55
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,878
...of trying to find the keys out of this.

56
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,036
Can I try it?

57
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,591
- Did you try this one yet?
- That's the first one I tried.

58
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,157
- That's the key to my locker at the gym.
- Your locker at the gym?

59
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,069
- Yes. Bet you don't know what this key is.
- Frank's locker at the gym.

60
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,035
No, no. Actually, it's Bruce's locker.
This is Frank's.

61
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,315
We sure are hitting it off.

62
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,312
Nervous?

63
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,358
Me, nervous? Are you nervous?

64
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,073
I am.

65
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,198
Whoo!

66
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,951
You rich?

67
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,116
Why? Does it matter?

68
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,032
This is a stick-up.

69
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,758
I want your diamonds and your minks
and your credit cards and your whatnot.

70
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,114
Take everything.

71
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,833
Everything?

72
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,918
Come here, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

73
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,038
- This is my cat, Nathan.
- How are you, Nathan?

74
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,637
- He doesn't like you.
- He's very talkative.

75
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,990
- That's OK. I like you.
- Do you?

76
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,195
What has four legs and chases cats?

77
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,313
- I don't know.
- Mrs Katz and her lawyer.

78
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,391
Oh. That's very sad.

79
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,115
- You're a married man.
- What?

80
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,594
- What?
- You're a married man.

81
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,315
- No. Not really, no.
- Why? What happened?

82
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,875
She was cheating.

83
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,552
I came home one day,
there was this guy in the closet.

84
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,513
...on his knees with a cigar in his mouth.

85
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,714
He said, "This ain't what you think. "

86
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,308
I said, "I don't care what it is, pal,
just don't do nothing in front of the kids. "

87
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,358
- You have kids.
- Oh, yeah.

88
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,552
- How many?
- Oh, nine, ten.

89
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,636
Ten or eleven.

90
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,916
About two.

91
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,033
- Where are they now?
- I don't know.

92
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,358
- You're a loner?
- Oh, no.

93
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,516
I got a lot of friends.

94
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,152
I really like you.

95
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,432
- What?
- I said, "I really like you. "

96
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,430
Yeah, yeah.

97
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,596
I'm a charmer.

98
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,592
- I think you're nifty.
- Nifty?

99
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,190
I mean, nice. I can tell you're nice.

100
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,111
I'm a natural.

101
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,433
- That's cute.
- Thank you.

102
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,916
- You look like Little Miss Muffet.
- Why?

103
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,510
- My breasts are too small?
- Too small for what?

104
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,788
What are you doing?

105
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,150
I really don't know.

106
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,434
- You're wearing your socks to bed.
- Yeah.

107
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,596
That's a very bad sign.

108
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,553
It means you're going to leave quick.

109
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,672
Oh, yeah.

110
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,558
You always wear your sweater to bed?

111
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,194
Yeah. I think my breasts are too small.

112
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,355
- What?
- Kiss it.

113
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,516
Kiss it?

114
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,154
I love to have my arms kissed.

115
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,956
What's so great about that?

116
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,753
"Born to win. "

117
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,355
Are you born to win?

118
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,512
You better believe it.

119
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:48,395
- What's that?
- That's where I get my vitamin shots.

120
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,668
Vitamin... Vitamin B52.
It's good for my memory.

121
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,154
You got a nice body on you.

122
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,509
You don't think my breasts are too small?

123
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,153
Yeah.

124
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,236
They're bigger than mine.

125
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,712
Parm.

126
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,353
- Geek, my man.
- The name is Vivian, dope fiend.

127
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:07,269
How're ya doing, JJ?
I'd like to take care of you.

128
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,159
- A friend of mine's coming by.
- I have a job for you.

129
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,436
- No, man. I can't.
- This is easy.

130
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,918
All you have to do is take a package
from person A to person B.

131
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,315
What do you want from me?

132
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,476
Want? You're the one who wants.

133
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,196
Man, you got everything.
You got your chicks, your limousine.

134
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,755
- Give me a few bags on credit.
- Oh, JJ.

135
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,030
You've got my wife hustling for you.

136
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,914
You want her with some spade?

137
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,715
You know there's nothing lower
than a junkie chick, JJ.

138
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,919
Come on.

139
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,429
Come on, now.

140
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,995
She'll be very happy to see you.

141
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,760
We'll do some work and then I'll fix you up.

142
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,798
- JJ, hi. How are you?
- Hi, Marlene.

143
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,160
- What can I do?
- I got something for Stanley.

144
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,113
- Un petit moment, cheri.
- You're looking good.

145
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,876
Stanley, it's JJ.

146
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,796
- Hi, JJ.
- How are you, Stanley?

147
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,958
I got something for you.
You got something for me? A little taste?

148
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:06,869
- You'll get yours from the Geek.
- You know the Geek. Hey, listen.

149
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,675
Marlene's hair. I was looking at it.
She's got kind of a...

150
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,036
She's got kind of a Bronx look, Stanley.

151
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,079
I was thinking I could give her
more of a Manhattan look.

152
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,516
- Like a cap cut.
- What?

153
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,995
A cap cut. You know, like...

154
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,434
Like Sassoon. Vidal Sassoon.

155
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,394
- It's very in, Stanley.
- Bye, JJ. See you around.

156
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,836
Geek? Geek, buddy.

157
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,589
Geek. Geek? Don't forget me.

158
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,158
Geek... Geek, we had a deal.

159
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:31,193
J, where have you been?

160
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,276
You know where I've been.

161
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,792
Was it difficult?

162
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,152
No. Kick cold turkey,
lay around in jail 18 months - Nothing.

163
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,910
- I'm sorry.
- How are the kids?

164
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,554
They're with my mother in California.

165
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,116
Geek, you got something for me?

166
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:05,429
- Vivian's the name, JJ.
- Right.

167
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,070
- Then let's hear it.
- Vivian.

168
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,919
- You haven't been around for a while, J.
- No.

169
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,915
- I took a bust.
- Yeah. I heard about that.

170
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,078
- Some junkie chick ratted on you.
- Yeah.

171
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,159
Well, it's them junkie chicks, J.

172
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,793
What can I say?

173
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,439
Why did you let me catch that fall?

174
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,317
You were supposed to watch over me.

175
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,955
I dream about you...

176
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,236
...almost every night.

177
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,550
Even in jail.

178
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,109
Can I come back to you?

179
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,431
No, J.

180
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,072
Why did you mess me up like this?

181
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,758
Why?

182
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,353
Why?

183
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,872
Geek.

184
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,236
You owe me some money.

185
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,592
You got yours in dope.

186
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,069
Four lousy bags.

187
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,873
I never thought you'd turn on a friend.

188
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,276
Who's a friend?

189
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,515
I'm an acquaintance.

190
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,153
Geek.

191
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,118
You're messing
with some bad people, man.

192
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,709
So there's a fortune in dope up there...

193
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,799
...but to deliver it one day and take
the cat off the next, you gotta be insane.

194
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,355
I've gotta hit big and clear out.

195
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,154
That guy Stanley, what is he into?

196
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,319
Businessman. He's strictly a profiteer.
He don't even use.

197
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,874
- Are you sure the dude's out?
- Sshh!

198
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,196
- Qui est Ià?
- Mr Charm.

199
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,278
- JJ.
- You guessed it.

200
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,277
- Hiya.
- Hi.

201
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,914
- Stanley isn't home.
- I know.

202
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,678
- You wanna come in?
- It's up to you.

203
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,236
OK. Come in.

204
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,436
This is my friend.

205
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,237
- You don't mind black folks, do you?
- No.

206
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,355
- Does he have a name?
- Do you have a name?

207
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,516
Just call me the bogeyman.

208
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,076
Just sit over there.

209
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,192
Sit, sit, sit.

210
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,709
So... Stanley's out on the island, huh?

211
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,036
Mm-hm. Business.

212
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,469
He's all business, that Stanley.

213
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,238
I want to pick up that package
that I dropped off.

214
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,437
- You what?
- The package. I want it back.

215
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,075
- You got your money, JJ.
- Somebody else did. I got kadoches.

216
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:59,191
Yeah. Well, that's your business.
I have nothing to do with that.

217
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,391
Marlene, this is a take-off.

218
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,592
- You gotta be kidding.
- No. I'm not kidding.

219
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,870
This is a take-off.

220
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:17,039
- Come on. Give me the goodies.
- I don't know where the...

221
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,118
Look, lady,
if you don't own up to that package...

222
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,075
I'm going to take all your furs and jewels
and shove 'em down your throat.

223
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,794
That's about the size of it, Marlene.

224
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,913
- You're not gonna hurt me, are you?
- No. I'm not a violent person.

225
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,429
I'm all peace and love.

226
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,235
- JJ, Stanley's gonna kill me.
- Stanley always had a lousy attitude.

227
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,634
Come on.

228
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,879
- Give me a taste?
- I didn't know you indulged.

229
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,150
Stanley doesn't even know.

230
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,957
- No, man.
- I think some other time is better.

231
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,158
- Why?
- C'est la vie, Marlene.

232
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,275
- Let's go, JJ!
- Yeah.

233
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,433
- Cops.
- All right, freeze!

234
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,351
Police.

235
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,713
Ooh, look, baby. We got guns, baby.

236
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,956
Split up!

237
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,512
Get him!

238
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,477
Hold it!

239
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,070
Did you get your rocks off?

240
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,634
Not yet. I'm gonna get 'em off now.

241
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,308
- Eddie?
- In here, Danny. I got one.

242
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,789
I lost the other one, but I got the package.

243
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,956
Come on, spread 'em.

244
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,918
- I got a freako with an attitude.
- Uh-huh.

245
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,238
- I know him. It's JJ. How ya doin', J?
- Move it. Come on.

246
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,192
Not too good, man.

247
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,512
I got him up on a stick-up, '67, '68.
I had him cold.

248
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,676
He talked and he walked, didn't you?

249
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,838
That's the name of the game.
Talk and walk.

250
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,838
Yeah. You should have done
five years minimum, J.

251
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,077
I had nothing to do with that.
These guys came from Florida.

252
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,431
I introduced them to a party
and this party beats 'em.

253
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,995
So in retaliation they made up this story.

254
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,351
...that J and a friend of his
got these ice picks...

255
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,109
...stuck 'em up and took 800 dollars,
which is ridiculous.

256
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,276
Anyway, there's some smack here.

257
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,471
Hi, lady.

258
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,955
We're making an arrest. Step outside...

259
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:22,154
I don't care. The things people are doing
in this house, you wouldn't believe.

260
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,831
You guys are embarrassing me.

261
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:28,316
I've had enough of your lip, J.
We'll take a little walk.

262
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,308
Where are we going?
Hey, lady! Police brutality, lady!

263
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,875
- Come on.
- They're gonna beat me up!

264
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,514
We're gonna put you on ice
for a long time, J.

265
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,676
Danny? Danny?

266
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,395
Give me a break, will ya? I'm trying
to wipe jones completely out of me.

267
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:52,916
- Get up.
- I'm slipping up in my jail time.

268
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:59,076
Three months here and five months there.
I just pulled a year and a half.

269
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,271
I'm only out three months, Danny.

270
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,760
God. I'm tired, man.

271
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,916
I'm just physically tired.

272
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,030
Don't chain me up.
Please don't chain me up, Danny.

273
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,950
Hey, J, look. You're gonna
have to take a big fall, baby.

274
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,515
You wanna play, you gotta pay, baby.

275
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,995
When you pitch, J, you gotta catch.

276
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,270
Come on.

277
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,916
Cool. Nice and cool. That's it.

278
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:52,875
- How about the Geek?
- You know the Geek, don't you?

279
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,709
- Yeah. I know him.
- Where does he hang out?

280
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,275
Open End. 77th and 1st.

281
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,119
We're gonna get the Geek, J,
and you're gonna get him for us.

282
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,276
Do you understand?

283
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,519
All right. You're gonna keep on
walking and talking, baby.

284
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,472
Hi, sweetheart.

285
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,395
What kind of freak idea was that?

286
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,633
- Taking poor Stanley off.
- I never did that.

287
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:29,833
- You're really, really in trouble with him.
- What did he say?

288
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,789
He wants to pass you a hot shot.

289
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,709
Strychnine, battery acid.
Take your choice.

290
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,233
What can I say? Stanley wants to ice you.

291
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,954
Screw him where he breeds.

292
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,588
So I've been racking my brain.

293
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,633
What can I do for JJ?

294
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,433
Give him a nice score - 500, 1,000.

295
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,872
You'd do that for me?

296
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,598
First you have to do a little job for me.

297
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,749
Geek, if I could break out of this town,
man, I'd kiss your feet.

298
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,270
Not here, J. Just do the job.

299
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,636
Right. Right.

300
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,397
Drive out to Kennedy Airport tomorrow
morning. 9am flight from Paris.

301
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,750
Wear a red tie.

302
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,355
- What's it worth?
- 20 years.

303
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,870
I know that, man. I mean my price.

304
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,713
800.

305
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,152
And a few bags.

306
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,355
I'm not addicted, I'm habituated.
You know?

307
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,478
Like...

308
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:12,714
Tomorrow, when I get the money
from the guy, we're gonna get out of here.

309
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,629
We're gonna take a trip
and I'm gonna get clean. Like that.

310
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,309
'Cause, you know,
it's the environment that kills you.

311
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:26,150
You know? It's these greasy junkies
that I gotta hang out with.

312
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,112
You can't trust any of them.

313
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:34,189
I trust you. You could ask me anything.

314
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,915
How many men you gone to bed with?

315
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,436
60?

316
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,271
Who's that? Me over there?

317
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,440
Who's the little guy on the end?

318
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,240
I didn't see you for two days.

319
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:39,194
- Did you like him?
- I loved him.

320
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,231
Oh, J!

321
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:51,560
I was just kidding about all those men.
J! Don't you know that's you?

322
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,510
Just a freak collector, aren't you?

323
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,837
You're tiptoeing around junk
because you think it's hip.

324
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,828
Soon you'll be dipping and dabbing,
then you'll end up with a habit.

325
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,271
...and take your tail out in the street
and sell it for junk.

326
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:21,868
J, I don't want all those things to happen.
I want us to be like regular people.

327
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:26,512
I'm sorry. I'm a little moochy.

328
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,915
Do you have to do this?

329
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,033
Sometimes I just wanna
turn my head around.

330
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,114
I'm a very boring guy when I'm straight.

331
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,952
Kitty.

332
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,712
Oh, yes. Yes.

333
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:04,355
Where are you going?

334
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,314
Wait for me.

335
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,953
- Where are you going?
- To take care of that job.

336
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,912
- I'm coming.
- You can't.

337
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:15,951
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

338
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:22,997
I'm only gonna be gone a couple of hours
and then we can do anything we want.

339
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,236
I don't believe you.

340
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,159
- Don't you trust me?
- No. Let's go.

341
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,399
Wait. If they catch you,
you're gonna be in jail for 20 years.

342
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,592
If you don't let me go with you,
I'm gonna scream.

343
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:38,360
- No, you're not.
- Aah...

344
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,240
He's completely dead, that guy.

345
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:27,991
Listen, you know that for $342 we can get
a round-trip ticket to Bermuda?

346
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,509
- For two?
- Yup. We can go right away.

347
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:35,831
I gotta deliver the package,
pick up my pay and then we're off.

348
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:37,792
OK.

349
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,511
- I'm looking for Ray.
- Third floor, number 47.

350
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,714
Spooky.

351
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:53,598
Is that Mafia?

352
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,715
No Mafia. Business people. Square,
respectable business people. Let's go.

353
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,474
They're cutting us off. Move it!

354
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,712
Baby, get outta here!

355
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,835
Aagh!

356
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,270
Where's my goods?

357
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,399
I don't...

358
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,549
I'll tell ya. I'll tell ya.
A friend of mine's got 'em.

359
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,910
Where is he?

360
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,315
He's around town, upside down... Ah!

361
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,554
I need a phone. Take me to a phone.

362
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,196
Tell him you've got a buyer.
We'll pick him up.

363
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,356
OK.

364
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,352
Is Billy Dynamite there?

365
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,994
He's not there. That's the best I could do.

366
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,276
- Take your clothes off.
- What?

367
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,118
Take your clothes off.

368
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,517
OK. OK, OK. OK.

369
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:30,394
When I get my package,
maybe you get your clothes.

370
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,116
Everything.

371
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:02,990
Put him in the room in back.

372
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:08,274
Hey, listen...

373
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,233
He's a junkie.
He may not be back for days.

374
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,238
I guess you got a streak of bad luck, J.

375
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,071
Hello.

376
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,836
And look at this.

377
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,072
Yes! Is that your mother? Oh, yes!

378
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,398
Yes. Call the police. Yes!

379
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,316
Come in, Stanley.

380
00:50:47,360 --> 00:50:50,158
- You got a light?
- Get off the bed.

381
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,799
Oh.

382
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,432
What's he doing in there?

383
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,952
Open up! Police!

384
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:24,109
- I'm getting the hell outta here!
- Come on, let's go!

385
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,633
- Can I help you, sir?
- I'd like to see some jackets.

386
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,195
- What did you have in mind?
- Double length.

387
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:23,359
Right over this way, sir.
Excuse me for a moment.

388
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:39,437
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- What exactly did you have in mind?

389
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,117
Hey, buddy. What do you get for this?

390
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,516
I'm sorry.

391
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,910
It's just that I was so scared.

392
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,350
I thought they'd killed you.

393
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:13,836
I was set up. The Geek set me up.

394
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:19,435
I don't understand it.
I keep getting beat. I'm sick of it!

395
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,349
I'm sick of it.

396
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,676
We can go away somewhere.

397
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,118
We can get in the car and go anywhere.

398
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,436
Right away.

399
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,270
I was so scared.

400
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:05,476
# Oh, it takes a worried man
to sing a worried song.

401
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:10,037
# Oh, it takes a worried man
to sing a worried song... #

402
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,800
- Happy? Is it gonna be OK?
- Yes.

403
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,594
- We're gonna have a good time?
- Yes.

404
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:18,268
- For all the time?
- Yes.

405
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,436
- You like my neck?
- I love your neck.

406
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,916
You really wanna kiss my neck.
You're gonna kiss my neck.

407
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,594
You're filthy.

408
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:38,713
"When she got there, her cupboard
was bare, so her poor dog had none. "

409
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,356
Nursery rhymes don't rhyme.
"To get her poor dog a bone...

410
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,109
"When she got there, the cupboard
was bare, so she had known. "

411
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:50,516
- It really was wonderful. Wonderful.
- It was nothing.

412
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,679
You weren't me. If you'd been where I was,
it'd have been wonderful.

413
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:58,634
I'll tell you another nursery rhyme
if you get down there again.

414
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,271
You get better and better.

415
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,710
Who, I do? Can I have a kiss?

416
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,758
I love this. You know what I love about it?

417
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,234
- You wanna know?
- Yes.

418
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,796
I love the smooching, necking quality of it.

419
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:23,310
That whole teenage thing,
it just does something to me.

420
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:26,671
I'm doing it now and I'm an old person.

421
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,396
And old drug-addicted junkie and
I got a girl and I got my arm around her.

422
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:34,558
- It's a terrific feeling.
- It'll get better.

423
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,877
- I don't think it gets better than this.
- I think so.

424
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:46,195
# That is me singing
with the wind to you.

425
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,669
# That's me looking from above.

426
00:56:52,880 --> 00:57:01,709
# That is me whispering
with the wings to you.

427
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:09,315
# That's me remembering our love #

428
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:16,992
Wow.

429
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,790
- What is that?
- I wrote it.

430
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,596
Are you kidding?

431
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,756
You wrote that?

432
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,754
- Have you ever tried to sell that?
- No.

433
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,996
That's a best-seller.

434
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,156
Do you like me?

435
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,795
You'll do.

436
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,430
Do I look good in a moustache?

437
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:53,751
Why do you like me?

438
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:58,630
I don't know. Why do you like me?

439
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,798
I don't know.

440
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,956
What do you want?

441
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,396
I wanna go back and get my money
from that creep.

442
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,708
I did the job, didn't I? Right?

443
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:02,917
I risked 20 years, right?

444
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,030
I deserve to get paid.

445
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:10,516
He pays me, I'm gonna set him up.

446
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,838
It isn't the money, J.
We can get money. What do you want?

447
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,237
What is it? What do you want?

448
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,952
# All this time.

449
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:45,197
# When I was with you.

450
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:48,392
# I'll be with you... #

451
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,393
That corner.

452
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,838
- Give me some money.
- $25. Is that enough?

453
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:17,632
J!

454
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,155
- Come back home to me.
- Sure.

455
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:29,516
- You seen Billy?
- No, man.

456
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,599
Billy.

457
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,751
Hey, Billy. Billy, it's J.

458
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:44,476
- J, baby. Hello there, man.
- I'm looking to score. What's happening?

459
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:48,673
Ain't nothin' happening down here.
I know where we can score uptown.

460
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:52,475
- Let's go. Get your stuff.
- Oh, J.

461
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:57,513
- I thought you got popped, man.
- I did, but I mouthed my way out.

462
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,995
If anyone can mouth, baby, you can!

463
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,996
I thought you was in the slammer.

464
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:08,429
Not so fast, not so fast.

465
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:16,878
That looks like Little Davey up there, man.

466
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:21,156
Yeah. That is Little Davey.
Pull over to the side there.

467
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,958
- Davey, my man. How ya doin'?
- What's happening, man?

468
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,833
Hey... I wanna score, man.

469
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:36,110
- How much you want?
- About half a load.

470
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:38,993
- Let me check with my man.
- Right.

471
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,196
- What's happening?
- It's cool.

472
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,277
- Where'd he go?
- To check his man out.

473
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:50,552
- This is my man, Conception.
- What's happening?

474
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:53,115
- How much you cats got?
- 20.

475
01:04:54,560 --> 01:04:57,632
- $20 for half a load?
- We can work it out.

476
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,440
Whoa. Dig, man.

477
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:07,035
All right. Cool it here.
I'll check on my man.

478
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,277
Right. I think I can get two more.

479
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:12,948
It's all right, man. He'll work it out.

480
01:05:13,160 --> 01:05:15,833
- Does he get good stuff?
- Hot shit, man.

481
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:20,192
Ask your man here. Conception's a bitch.

482
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,357
It's all right.

483
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:36,830
This is a take-off. Cool it now.
We want everything youse got.

484
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:40,669
- Just don't move and be cool.
- Shit, Davey. Come on, man.

485
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,874
Listen, man. I got a jones, man,
and you're the only people coming round.

486
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:49,436
- I need the money, man.
- Put it in there.

487
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,068
It ain't that we don't like you or nothing.

488
01:05:54,280 --> 01:05:58,159
We do a lot of business together
and we can still do some...

489
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,476
...but I'm uptight today, you dig it?

490
01:06:00,680 --> 01:06:03,956
- I knew you'd understand.
- Will you leave us some car fare?

491
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:06,879
Man, can we leave them some car fare?

492
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:08,832
They can walk.

493
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:13,795
Damn, Davey, who'd ever think
you'd burn a man?

494
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:16,798
- Coat.
- Man, it's cold outside.

495
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:18,433
Coat.

496
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:21,029
- You want everything, right?
- Everything.

497
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:24,152
How about this? Hold it, Davey!

498
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:29,237
Brother, dear... Yeah.
Now what are you gonna say, huh?

499
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:31,908
That Conception guy's a bad mother, man.

500
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:36,193
- We've been doing business.
- Yeah, right.

501
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:41,269
- You got to give me... Come on, man.
- Everything. Every bit of...

502
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:44,870
Listen, man.
Didn't I try to get you the car fare?

503
01:06:45,080 --> 01:06:47,548
That's more than I'm gonna give you.

504
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:50,832
You run up them steps
and keep on running. Understand?

505
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,191
You turn back just once, baby,
and you're dead.

506
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:56,277
Put it there!

507
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:11,872
So you got nothing to tell us?

508
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,789
If I did, I would.
Talk and walk - That's my motto.

509
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,839
Then what's your tie-in with him?

510
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,871
Hello and goodbye.

511
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:24,389
Hey, we want that mother bad, J.

512
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,552
So you're gonna take a fall.

513
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:30,638
You're gonna sweat
and you're gonna scream.

514
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:33,434
Because we're gonna plant you
on a 2-20-20.

515
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,915
- You'll plant me?
- Yeah.

516
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:39,953
That's right. We want Vivian on a sale, J.

517
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,515
What do you mean,
you're gonna plant me?

518
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:47,236
Do you know how much time you can get?
We can throw away the key.

519
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,635
But we wanna keep you on the street.

520
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:53,549
'cause that's the only way
we can get that rat-freako.

521
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:58,356
We know where he lives, who he does
business with, how they do business...

522
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,710
...but we gotta get him on a buy.

523
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:05,274
We wanna buy off the Geek, J.

524
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,074
I don't have
that kind of relationship with him.

525
01:08:08,280 --> 01:08:10,794
Unless you tell us,
you're gonna take a pinch.

526
01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:16,274
I'm clean. I'm not holding. I'm clean.

527
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,309
You're holding that, bud.

528
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:40,109
Just tell 'em you got some friends
from outta town.

529
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:43,073
...and they wanna buy
some heavy weight, simple.

530
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:47,639
If I give him up, it's my life.

531
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:51,799
With what we got on you, you're gonna
do 20 years minimum anyway.

532
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:01,116
You guys are scumbags.

533
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,918
J, why don't you give me a call
sometime? I miss you.

534
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:21,076
Yeah, I will. I'll do that.

535
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:47,874
- How much do you want?
- I want a ki.

536
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,036
That'll be about 20 thou.

537
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,559
- It's gotta be at least 12 cut-down, right?
- It'll be pure.

538
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,874
There's stuff going around for about 16.

539
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,913
Yeah. There's stuff going around.

540
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,908
OK. So your stuff is pure.
Let's say we make a meet at about 18.

541
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:11,109
- You have the money with you?
- Give me a taste, I'll make a call.

542
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,479
If I sell you a ki of something
and you happen to be the wrong guy...

543
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,477
...then I'd do some heavy time.

544
01:10:18,680 --> 01:10:20,955
That's why we got J here, right?

545
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:28,469
That's if I were selling
and JJ was setting me up.

546
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,036
You hear that, Jerome?

547
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,512
Jerome?

548
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,079
I think the only good addict
is a dead addict.

549
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,317
We got a deal or not?

550
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,600
No. No.

551
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:15,597
Da-da!

552
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,829
Hey, baby. Hey.

553
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:20,439
Hey, y'all.

554
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:22,995
You see that? Nothing.

555
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,710
Your Parm, man, she's really together.

556
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:32,628
She sure is fine, man, your chick Parm.

557
01:11:32,840 --> 01:11:36,549
Nice chick, really nice,
and she digs you, man.

558
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,034
Yeah.

559
01:11:38,240 --> 01:11:41,710
This cat who's bringing the bag,
you copped from him before?

560
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,038
Yeah. A while ago,
he used to hang with Long Willy.

561
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:50,028
I sure hope it ain't no lemonade, man.
You know what I mean?

562
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:53,679
Hey.

563
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:57,953
You know, baby, I love this life. Love it.

564
01:11:58,160 --> 01:12:02,597
When we get up in the morning, we know
exactly what we're gonna do next.

565
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,200
Hustle for another bag.

566
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,630
I wouldn't give it up for nothing.

567
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:13,559
No. 'Cause like
we've got a purpose in life, you know?

568
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:16,320
How many people can really say that?

569
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:26,917
You wouldn't believe this, J, but
before I got into drugs, I was into myself.

570
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,997
I couldn't go out and do things, man.

571
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:33,475
I had what you might call a complex.

572
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:36,871
- Hey, man.
- What's happening?

573
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,992
- Same. What's happening?
- Same thing, man.

574
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,435
- Be cool.
- Yeah.

575
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,153
Later.

576
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:54,469
Hey, baby. Hey.

577
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:58,470
Hey! Hey, look here.

578
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,353
You speak English? What's your name?

579
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:23,198
That's fantastic, baby!
She did it. She gave me a date.

580
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,750
Where do you think I should take her?

581
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:48,951
Take her to 42nd Street to a movie.

582
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:52,630
And have all them dope fiends
hitting on her? No.

583
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:55,115
How about Radio City Music Hall?

584
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,517
What if I took her
to Jack Dempsey's for dinner?

585
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:00,676
- Have you ever been there?
- Yeah.

586
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:03,474
- What's it like?
- Nice. She'll like it.

587
01:14:03,680 --> 01:14:06,672
- You sure nobody's on this floor?
- Positive.

588
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:08,472
Beautiful.

589
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:16,830
Wow, baby, this is out of sight.
It's tough, man. Where'd you find it?

590
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,949
Yeah. It's too much, baby.

591
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:27,553
Yeah. All right.

592
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,832
It's a problem, man,
where to take a chick in this city.

593
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,316
Where do you take a girl if you want
to make a good impression?

594
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,988
To bed. No, right to bed.

595
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,794
You always come up
with something like that.

596
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,037
I can never hold a serious discussion
wi' you, J.

597
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,640
- You gotta learn to broaden yourself.
- Billy.

598
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:49,149
- Yeah?
- We got Spanish quarters.

599
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,430
- No jive?
- One for two.

600
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:53,756
One for me, one for you.

601
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,590
Dig it!

602
01:14:56,800 --> 01:14:58,756
Yeah. I'm going first, right?

603
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:02,475
- Who copped? What do you mean?
- Who copped last time?

604
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:04,955
Yeah. Well, who went first last time?

605
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:07,355
- You.
- Yeah. I guess I did.

606
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,996
- That's right.
- I guess that leaves you.

607
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:14,949
Say what?

608
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,720
Ah.

609
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:20,874
- What's happening?
- It's OK.

610
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,234
Yeah.

611
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,555
There you go.

612
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,591
Yes, indeed.

613
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:52,756
I need a gas too, man.

614
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:57,956
Why don't you bring the old lady with us?
Go out together.

615
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,958
- OK.
- You like that?

616
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:03,435
It might be a gas, man.

617
01:16:03,640 --> 01:16:05,631
Take care of a little business.

618
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:08,472
Do a little do.

619
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,636
Oobie-doo. Oobie-doo-pooh!

620
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:13,792
You dig it?

621
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:19,239
Yeah.

622
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:22,079
All right.

623
01:16:27,960 --> 01:16:30,952
- Come on, man. Hurry up.
- It's coming.

624
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:33,993
Oh, yeah. There it is. There it is.

625
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,517
OK. You ready? Here it comes.

626
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:48,036
Come on... Come on...

627
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:52,234
Billy.

628
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,154
Thank you kindly, sir.
May God take a liking to you.

629
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:04,599
- Why don't you go with us?
- Maybe. Maybe.

630
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:08,031
We go to Dempsey's
and have a good dinner...

631
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:11,596
we go discothequing,
then I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

632
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:14,917
I'm going to bed, me and that chick!

633
01:17:15,120 --> 01:17:18,476
- Take me with you.
- If you don't wanna go to Demp... Agh!

634
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,753
Billy?

635
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,913
Billy.

636
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,749
Call my mother, man! Call my mother, J!

637
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:52,954
Billy.

638
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:55,435
Don't go out. Billy. Don't go out.

639
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,757
Billy. Please, don't go out.

640
01:18:07,720 --> 01:18:09,711
Oh, my God.

641
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,836
We're leaving right now.

642
01:18:58,040 --> 01:18:59,792
Billy's dead.

643
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,831
What happened?

644
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,600
He's dead.

645
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,872
- They gave us a hot shot.
- What's that?

646
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:17,231
Battery acid, rat poison.
It was meant for me.

647
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,313
- Pull over.
- Why?

648
01:19:20,520 --> 01:19:22,715
Just pull over. I wanna do something.

649
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,472
Hey, J!

650
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,670
What is it? What the hell is this?

651
01:19:38,720 --> 01:19:40,915
- You're going down, J.
- What for?

652
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:44,829
- Don't ask me. You know.
- I'm clean. I'm here with my girlfriend.

653
01:19:45,720 --> 01:19:49,315
Wanna roll down the window? Police.

654
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:53,798
- Is she a hooker?
- No, she's a square kid. She's my fiancée.

655
01:19:56,360 --> 01:19:58,794
Yeah, that looks like a hooker to me.

656
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:01,916
- Is this your car?
- Yes.

657
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:06,153
- Where did you get this?
- None of your business.

658
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:08,874
Don't cop no attitude with me, lady.

659
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,109
Has he got a warrant?

660
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:18,471
- Have you got a warrant?
- You're in big trouble, sweetheart.

661
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:23,674
It's a plant. That's a plant.
I'm gonna wreck you! You're planting her!

662
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:25,438
- I'm gonna wreck you!
- What?

663
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,633
I'm gonna wreck you with my mouth.
Harassment! Harassment!

664
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,796
Police harassment! Oh!

665
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:38,518
- What are you doing this for?
- Weren't you doing something for us?

666
01:20:38,720 --> 01:20:41,757
I tried to make a deal,
but he wouldn't bite. Ask Danny.

667
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:46,036
We're gonna turn you loose,
but your girl is taking a bust.

668
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:49,391
No, man. I'll take the bust.
Let me do it. Please.

669
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,435
We want you out on the streets.

670
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:58,070
We want you on the streets.
Now get outta here.

671
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:05,753
Get outta here!

672
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:22,595
J! J!

673
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:34,713
J.

674
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:42,109
You look tired. Can I help you in any way?

675
01:22:44,640 --> 01:22:47,837
I'm sorry, J...

676
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:50,996
...for everything.

677
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,230
Man, you're in the light.

678
01:23:01,040 --> 01:23:02,837
Geek, my man.

679
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:06,957
You've been a bad boy, Jerome.

680
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:11,358
- Can you fix me up?
- Sure, sure. I'd love to fix you.

681
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:17,192
- I'll pay you soon as I can.
- It's a gift.

682
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:27,949
- What are my odds?
- Your odds?

683
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,276
That it's not a hot shot.

684
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,870
So what if it is?
It'll be the best jolt you'll ever get.

685
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:36,275
You're the winner, aren't you?

686
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:38,232
Born to win.
