00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:42,564
SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,638
From the novel <i>DownThere</i> by
DAVID GOODIS

3
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,021
I don't know how to thank you.

4
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,993
I ran into this streetlight
like an idiot.

5
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:45,324
I've gotta run.
She still waits up for me. Come on.

6
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:48,895
- How long you been married?
- Eleven years.

7
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,071
I wish I were married too.

8
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:55,668
- You say that like you mean it.
- I do.

9
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,508
It has its good points.

10
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,678
We almost didn't make it at first.

11
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:04,282
I'd watch her over breakfast,
wondering how to get rid of her.

12
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:08,650
But then I thought, “Where do you get
these ideas?” and I found no answer.

13
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:12,018
- A question of freedom, maybe?
- Yeah.

14
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,783
I met her at a dance.

15
00:03:15,428 --> 00:03:18,522
Had a helluva time
getting to know her.

16
00:03:18,765 --> 00:03:22,394
She hadn't been around much.
And you know Paris.

17
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:27,767
I'll bet there are more virgins here
than in any other city.

18
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,406
Proportionally, at least.

19
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,773
But listen -
that's not why I married her.

20
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,572
Why, then?

21
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,641
I got used to her.
We had good times.

22
00:03:39,852 --> 00:03:43,754
I don't know you,
and we may never meet again,

23
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:47,258
so all the more reason
to be frank.

24
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,556
Sometimes it helps
to spill your guts to a stranger.

25
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,664
There's some truth in that.

26
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,296
I ended up having feelings for her.
First time that ever happened.

27
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:01,871
We went together for a year.

28
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,771
One fine day, I went out
and bought the wedding ring.

29
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,208
It always happens like that.

30
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,903
Not always.

31
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,773
I think I really fell in love with her
two years later.

32
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,211
She was in the hospital
having our first kid.

33
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,913
I remember standing
next to her bed,

34
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,219
just looking down
at her and the baby.

35
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:26,387
I think that's the moment
it really started.

36
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,499
How many kids you got now?

37
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,395
Three.

38
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,001
A perfect number.

39
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,672
Yeah, they're great kids.

40
00:04:33,873 --> 00:04:36,967
I turn here,
so I'll say good-bye.

41
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,805
Take care, now.
- I sure will.

42
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,174
Thanks. And good luck!

43
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,265
CHARLIE KOLLER
DANCING NIGHTLY

44
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:29,293
- Hi, Edouard.
- Call me Charlie. And wait there.

45
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,859
You're a strange bird.

46
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,194
Four years since we last
saw each other,

47
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:39,997
and you'd think
I'd just gone around the block.

48
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:44,736
See this? It's so dark out,
I ran into a pole.

49
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,343
Someone after you?

50
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:49,344
Not the cops,
or I wouldn't get you involved.

51
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,007
So you came to get me involved?
Forget it.

52
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,091
Fido must have grown.

53
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,520
Things okay money-wise?

54
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,130
I'm getting by.
Just don't count on me for anything.

55
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,994
I don't want to get involved,
you hear?

56
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,067
How's the family?

57
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,900
- Everyone's fine: Mom, Dad -
- Richard?

58
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:17,975
Oh, you know,
always up to something.

59
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,770
But we miss you and Fido,

60
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,413
so I started thinking -

61
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,674
When they started chasing you.

62
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:30,745
Charlie, you gotta help.
I'm in a real fix.

63
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:33,926
So you come to me!
Who's after you?

64
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,560
Two guys.

65
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:39,630
We pulled a job, these two guys
and Richard and me.

66
00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,666
They tried to play rough
and gyp us out of our share.

67
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,806
So Richard and I kept the loot
and ditched them instead.

68
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,474
Great.

69
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:51,843
What do they look like?

70
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:55,571
One wears a hat,
the other a cap.

71
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,250
They're not brothers
but they look alike,

72
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,510
and they both smoke pipes.

73
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:19,436
Evening, Charlie.
How are things?

74
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,478
What the hell are you doing here?
You're throwing your life away!

75
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,341
- All right, all right.
- No, it's not all right!

76
00:07:29,549 --> 00:07:31,517
You look great
behind that piece of junk.

77
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:36,051
You deserve a concert grand
in a packed hall

78
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,723
before a cheering crowd,
so what gives?

79
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:42,224
- I can't be in two places at once.
- What a laugh!

80
00:07:42,428 --> 00:07:45,397
The world-famous artist
can't even afford a jalopy.

81
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:47,657
Somethings screwy there.
- Okay, okay.

82
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,266
Just shut up.

83
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:53,934
Look at him, the concert pianist
pounding out honky-tonk!

84
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,803
For chris sake,
get this guy a grand piano

85
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,103
with some candlesticks!

86
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,372
Where are those candlesticks?

87
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:04,174
Listen, pal, pipe down!

88
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:06,180
I want everyone to hear.

89
00:08:06,385 --> 00:08:08,148
They're too busy dancing.

90
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:10,686
That's the trouble with the world.
Nobody can be bothered.

91
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,120
Drop it, Plyne.
He's sick.

92
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:14,725
Who is he, pal?

93
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:17,862
I thought I made it clear:
Don't get chummy with me.

94
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,622
Call me mister.

95
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,562
Okay, mister, who is he?

96
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,635
Maybe my dear little brother
is ashamed of me.

97
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:30,002
He's an artist, my friend.
And his name's not Charlie.

98
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,733
It's Edouard.
- Shut up!

99
00:08:31,944 --> 00:08:33,571
He never mentioned a brother.

100
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,475
Yep, four kids in the family,
all boys.

101
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,046
What do you pay Charlie for?

102
00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,310
To play piano, of course.

103
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,081
So he's paid to play,
not spill his guts.

104
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,624
You want a guy to talk,
it'll cost you.

105
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:52,594
Like digging a well -
the deeper you go, the more it costs.

106
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,629
Sometimes it costs so much,

107
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,529
you just give up.

108
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:05,736
You're very alluring...

109
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,674
<i>and I'm lured.</i>

110
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,878
What luck! I just now decided
to get married.

111
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:13,479
You're the first one I'm asking.

112
00:09:13,686 --> 00:09:16,052
Who says I'm single?

113
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:19,113
It can't be! The Abominable Snowman
there is your guy?

114
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:22,761
Was my guy, though we haven't
officially broken up.

115
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:24,589
Besides, I don't even know you.

116
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,288
- Charlie's big brother.
- No kidding.

117
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,794
I just love Charlie.

118
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,560
And how about me?

119
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,762
It's too soon to tell.

120
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,974
You'll have to excuse me.
I've got customers.

121
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:42,541
Is my chest that exciting?

122
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:45,114
- You bet. I'm a doctor.
- Sure you are.

123
00:09:57,229 --> 00:09:59,060
Not the best crowd tonight.

124
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:02,928
The other night
was first-class quality.

125
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,000
Look at that!

126
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,165
Interesting.

127
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,398
Or just bizarre.

128
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,852
See you later, Charlie.

129
00:10:27,893 --> 00:10:30,828
- Christ, they're here!
- It's your problem.

130
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,624
- I'm done for!
- The back door! Go!

131
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,138
<i>The dame was named Frances</i>

132
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:50,876
<i>We all called her</i>

133
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,482
<i>The Raspberry</i>

134
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:53,845
<i>The sergeant was to blame</i>

135
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,384
<i>He was lame</i>

136
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,551
<i>In the brain</i>

137
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,883
<i>She served beer in a bar</i>

138
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,793
<i>Not far from the Loire</i>

139
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,188
<i>A tart, she was not</i>

140
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,385
<i>Beer was all we got</i>

141
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:05,564
<i>You'd have to have cheek</i>

142
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:06,857
<i>To pinch her cheek</i>

143
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:08,158
<i>She was right from Antibes</i>

144
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,664
<i>What a blight!</i>

145
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,962
<i>A blight on the Berry</i>

146
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,100
<i>That's fate, tit for tat</i>

147
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:17,439
<i>She was native Antibean</i>

148
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:19,934
<i>Closer than Carribean</i>

149
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:21,739
<i>Closer than Caracas</i>

150
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:22,845
<i>Or the Congo?</i>

151
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:23,981
<i>I don't know</i>

152
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,978
<i>The barrier of language</i>

153
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:29,312

<i>The wench, she knew French</i>

155
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,115
<i>Her eyes, they sizzled</i>

156
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:33,348
<i>My passion, it fizzled</i>

157
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,753
<i>I'm anti-Antibean</i>

158
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,984
<i>Despite myself</i>

159
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,321
<i>What a blight!</i>

160
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:39,722
<i>A blight on the Berry</i>

161
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,793
<i>That's fate, tit for tat</i>

162
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:44,398
<i>Her measurements were meager</i>

163
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,764
<i>No wonder she was eager</i>

164
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,232
<i>To be adding extra padding</i>

165
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,601
<i>At the Beauty Institute</i>

166
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:50,673
<i>Ah! Ah! Ah!</i>

167
00:11:50,976 --> 00:11:53,103
<i>By the Loire are beauticians</i>

168
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,846
<i>Who can add to your bosom</i>

169
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,106
<i>No surgical dangers</i>

170
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:58,340
<i>In Angers</i>

171
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,518
<i>For old gents and pretty maids</i>

172
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,913
<i>Attributes are custom-made</i>

173
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,052
<i>But for those who can't rejuvenate</i>

174
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:03,346
<i>What a blight!</i>

175
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,751
<i>A blight on the Berry</i>

176
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,983
<i>That's fate, tit for tat</i>

177
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,895
<i>Seeing her new measurements</i>

178
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,190
<i>Added to my torments</i>

179
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:14,588
<i>Ogling her plunging neckline</i>

180
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,734
<i>I gave her the old line</i>

181
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,567
<i>“Permit me to keep abreast</i>

182
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:22,104
<i>Of what's on your chest“</i>

183
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:24,841
<i>She ran away like a stranger</i>

184
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,204
<i>So I quit</i>

185
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,379
<i>I'm not fit for a dog</i>

186
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,604
<i>In a manger</i>

187
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:29,940
<i>The moral</i>

188
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,242
<i>A blight on tit for tat</i>

189
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,676
<i>And dame's fate is the berries!</i>

190
00:12:41,327 --> 00:12:42,988
<i>They must have gone
out the alley.</i>

191
00:12:43,195 --> 00:12:46,460
<i>They didn't look like killers.
Just wanted to talk business.</i>

192
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,462
<i>You can guess what kind.</i>

193
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:52,626
<i>When your brothers get mixed up in
something, big dumb Chico takes the fall.</i>

194
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:55,398
<i>Come on, wish him good luck
while there's still time.</i>

195
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,098
Good luck.

196
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,753
Good night.

197
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:24,768
She's really got her eye on you.

198
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,096
Who does?

199
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,796
Lena.
Thought you'd like to know.

200
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,033
Thanks anyway.

201
00:13:31,243 --> 00:13:33,768
Too bad you're not interested.

202
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,109
I wish she looked at me like that.

203
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:38,445
If I'm in the way, I can leave.

204
00:13:38,784 --> 00:13:41,582
Don't worry.
I'm not her type.

205
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,379
In fact,

206
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:44,783
I'm nobody's type.

207
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,355
See you tomorrow.

208
00:13:47,726 --> 00:13:49,023
Come now.

209
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:53,959
I'm just a big lug,

210
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,397
and too dumb
to make women forget it.

211
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,695
Could it be glands?

212
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,702
No, it's not my glands.
Just my ugly mug.

213
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,438
Don't be afraid of women.
They're not poisonous.

214
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:09,143
You don't really believe that.

215
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,873
I can see you've been
through the wringer too, my boy.

216
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,142
So what?

217
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:16,751
I bet I even know what's eating you.

218
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:20,157
You're shy and scared.

219
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:21,223
Scared?

220
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,088
That's right.

221
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:25,387
Scared.

222
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,059
I'm scared.

223
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:31,093
Shit, I'm scared!

224
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,098
You okay, pal?

225
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,134
I'm scared.

226
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,012
Who were those two guys?

227
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,410
No idea.

228
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:51,148
I'm going to bed.
Life goes on, after all.

229
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:53,883
<i>Hey, Mr. Charlie.</i>

230
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,899
I didn't want anyone else to hear.

231
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,000
Can you lend me some dough
until tomorrow?

232
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:04,169
Sure.

233
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,402
Here.

234
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,406
Walk with me a ways.

235
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:14,636
I don't like walking home
alone at night, Mr. Charlie.

236
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,549
Just call me Charlie.

237
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:22,411
Okay. Then you call me Léna.

238
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,918
Why Léna?

239
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:27,115
From Héléne to Héléna
to just Léna.

240
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,954
<i>It'll look odd if you don't talk.</i>

241
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:07,155
<i>Say something, anything,
or she'll think you're scared.</i>

242
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:11,234
<i>She's no fool. She knows silence
and romance go hand-in-hand.</i>

243
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:15,498
<i>She's the quiet type.
Not stuck-up - just serious.</i>

244
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,767
<i>No cheap jokes for her.</i>

245
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,309
<i>It'd take something really funny
to make her laugh.</i>

246
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:23,712
What's so funny?

247
00:16:23,916 --> 00:16:25,178
That face!

248
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:26,749
Listen.

249
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,616
You know those guys after your brother?
- No, why?

250
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:33,018
I think they're following us.

251
00:16:33,225 --> 00:16:34,715
Look here.

252
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:47,967
Where'd they go?

253
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,437
They must have taken off
that way.

254
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,072
Lousy luck!

255
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:54,805
So long.
I'm going home.

256
00:16:56,882 --> 00:16:58,144
Come on.

257
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:03,417
<i>She felt you against her,
but she didn't move away.</i>

258
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:05,852
<i>So she's willing -
but to do what?</i>

259
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,355
<i>Who knows?</i>

260
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:10,551
<i>Suggest getting a drink
to buy some time.</i>

261
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,424
<i>Don't mess this up.
Take it easy.</i>

262
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,861
<i>“We can't just say good-b ye.
Let's have a drink.</i> ”

263
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,728
<i>No, more subtle.</i>

264
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,130
<i>“I bet you're thirsty. Me too. "</i>

265
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:22,003
Want to get a drink -

266
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,639
<i>Probably just as well.</i>

267
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:28,210
<i>Think of something else.
Is Art Tatum talented?</i>

268
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:31,406
<i>Or Errol Garner?
Yes, garners got talent'.</i>

269
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:34,381
<i>Or Juno Manse? You can't say.
You don't even know him.</i>

270
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,214
It's me - Clarisse.

271
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:55,792
<i>Evening, Charlie.</i>

272
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:58,897
You still sleep in the raw?

273
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:01,905
It's better for you.

274
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,308
Reminds me of my skeleton number
at the carnival.

275
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:09,175
My first gig
after running away from home.

276
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:13,747
I lay inside a coffin,
practically naked,

277
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:16,284
and with a flick of the mirrors,
you could see my skeleton.

278
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,456
Even doctors fell for it.

279
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,623
Then I sprained an ankle.

280
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,225
It's tough being an artist.

281
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,725
- Want me to stay?
- I don't know.

282
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,761
- I'll put it on your tab.
- No, thanks.

283
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,032
Okay, I won't insist.

284
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,196
I'm going.

285
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,095
Don't be sore.

286
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,235
Take off that pretty dress.

287
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:38,875
Close Fido's door.

288
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:40,908
Isn't all of me pretty?

289
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:43,411
It's a good working dress.

290
00:19:43,615 --> 00:19:47,016
I don't have to bow and scrape
for customers.

291
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,243
<i>“How much?“</i>

292
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:51,251
“Three thousand.
Take it or leave it.”

293
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,221
I don't push the goods on anyone.
It's a free country.

294
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,055
I'll go behind here.
- Right. I might get ideas.

295
00:19:58,263 --> 00:20:01,391
I prefer pretty clothes
to the sexy ones some girls wear.

296
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,693
Aren't my clothes always pretty?

297
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:04,960
Very.

298
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:07,901
No, really. Very pretty.

299
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,706
The girls always ask
where I buy them.

300
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,971
Pretty, aren't they?
400 francs - a bargain.

301
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:17,910
What do I know
about your panties?

302
00:20:18,116 --> 00:20:19,777
Are you nuts?

303
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,475
No, just a prude.

304
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,084
A prude?

305
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,586
More like a prune!

306
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,021
Good one, huh?

307
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:34,059
Is pussycat hurt?
ls my pussycat mad?

308
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,928
Pussycat's not mad, just tired.

309
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:40,901
I even saw it on TV:
Pussycats are tired these days.

310
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:43,940
I'm sleepy,
and I prefer old-fashioned undies.

311
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:47,244
<i>TV is like a movie theater</i>

312
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:50,142
<i>You can go to right at home</i>

313
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,107
Move over.

314
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:06,023
This is how it's done
in the movies.

315
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,831
<i>I saw Torpedoes in Alaska</i>
at <i>the movies this afternoon.</i>

316
00:21:12,037 --> 00:21:12,935
Any good?

317
00:21:13,138 --> 00:21:15,902
John Wayne showing how
the USA only wants peace.

318
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:18,199
Well, well.
The Yanks are just like me.

319
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:19,934
You making fun of me?

320
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,306
I'd never do that, baby.

321
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,909
Give me a drag.

322
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:35,493
Hey, I thought
you were the shy type!

323
00:21:35,694 --> 00:21:38,629
You never heard?
Shy people can be bold too.

324
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,097
Clarisse, back to your room.
Fido's gonna wake up. Quick!

325
00:21:51,543 --> 00:21:54,239
Sure, I'm only fit to cook him
dinner every night.

326
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:56,880
Don't start that.
Pass me my trousers.

327
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,123
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing.

328
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,360
Zip me up, will you?

329
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:19,365
Go on home.
See you tonight.

330
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:26,099
Fido.

331
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,678
Time to get up.

332
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:38,479
Hurry up.
You'll be late.

333
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,793
Bye, Charlie.
See you tonight.

334
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,272
- Hello, Charlie.
- Have I had the pleasure?

335
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,009
I'm Ernest. He's Momo.

336
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,878
We'll give you a lift.
- I'll walk.

337
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:19,021
No need for that.

338
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,283
- Just to show him.
- He already knows.

339
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,223
- Maybe he's not sure.
- All right.

340
00:24:24,563 --> 00:24:27,794
Coming with us now?
- Yeah, now I am.

341
00:24:39,911 --> 00:24:42,971
- What do you think of our pal, Momo?
- He looks tough. You?

342
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:45,843
Me too.
We think you're tough.

343
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,754
Is 50,000 enough?
Give us a figure.

344
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,650
I don't need much money.

345
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:55,224
- Maybe he thinks we don't have it.
- Right. Show him the package.

346
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:59,789
Not very smart
carrying that much around.

347
00:25:05,971 --> 00:25:07,939
Enough talk.
Where were we?

348
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,733
He refused the money.
Let's try something else.

349
00:25:10,942 --> 00:25:14,207
Look, we only want to talk to him.
We won't hurt him.

350
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,140
Who?

351
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:19,443
I thought we agreed to be up front!
You know we mean your brother!

352
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:23,519
Put us in touch with him.
Take us to the farm.

353
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,486
- He could be away.
- I doubt it.

354
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:30,187
Momo, get in back.
Here's our mutual friend.

355
00:25:30,395 --> 00:25:33,296
The waitress.
“Mrs. Charlie," you might say.

356
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:42,704
No need for introductions, eh?

357
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,899
- Where are we going?
- Ask your boyfriend.

358
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,273
- He's not my boyfriend.
- We're paying his brother Chico a visit.

359
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,380
That man with the black eye?

360
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,517
They've done their homework.
First they find out he's my brother.

361
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,447
Then they get our addresses.

362
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:58,248
- How?
- I think I know how.

363
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,582
We'll tell you.

364
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:04,390
<i>We had a drink
with your boss this morning.</i>

365
00:26:04,596 --> 00:26:06,655
<i>The ugly ape made us pay
through the nose.</i>

366
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,766
<i>Fifty smackers.</i>

367
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:12,528
<i>Twenty-five for Charlie's address,
25 for hers.</i>

368
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,432
<i>He's a greedy, suspicious slob.</i>

369
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:18,939
<i>What a mug -
and how he stroked that wad!</i>

370
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,702
Plyne, the fat pig!

371
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,242
- Ernest, watch the road!
- Who's driving here?

372
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:25,143
You are! But be careful!

373
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,912
True. We must keep
our charming hostages safe.

374
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,782
You had time to pass that car!

375
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:34,857
He's waiting for you to pass.
- Do you mind?

376
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:37,153
- If I had the wheel!
- Around your neck?

377
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:39,694
- Don't get excited.
- I'm not.

378
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,199
If there's one thing I can do,

379
00:26:44,402 --> 00:26:46,131
it's drive a car.

380
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:48,966
I can make a car
do anything I want.

381
00:26:49,174 --> 00:26:51,665
- Except pass.
- You want me to blow my top?

382
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:55,209
No, just keep your eyes on the road
and stop ogling the chicks.

383
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:57,881
You'll kill someone
one of these days.

384
00:26:58,083 --> 00:27:00,950
Fitting vengeance for my father.

385
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:04,144
He got run over
crossing the street.

386
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:06,517
He was watching the women,
not the cars.

387
00:27:06,725 --> 00:27:10,217
Got his eye on a short skirt,
and down he goes.

388
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,364
- The old guy was a dirty old man!
- I must take after him.

389
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:17,160
I've got an eye for the moment

390
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:20,566
the Wind's gonna lift a skirt,
or some nice legs gonna board a bus.

391
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,571
Do I shock you?
- Not at all.

392
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:26,141
I've met bastards before.
I'm learning something.

393
00:27:26,344 --> 00:27:28,505
I tell you:

394
00:27:28,713 --> 00:27:31,511
No matter what women say,
they all want it.

395
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:33,047
Want what?

396
00:27:33,251 --> 00:27:35,617
It's just like he says:
They all want it.

397
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,186
And I say let 'em have it!

398
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,823
- But I've got nothing against women.
- I can see that.

399
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,928
I love 'em all,
precisely for what they are.

400
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:48,998
But they insist on talking before
and especially after,

401
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,761
just when a man
wants out of there, alone.

402
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,635
If I may, on the subject of women,
my father used to say,

403
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,902
“lf you've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.”

404
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:18,159
When I first lay eyes on a woman,
it's like a thunderbolt.

405
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:21,423
I'm in love.
I want marriage, babies.

406
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:25,592
But once they start gabbing,
I just want to lay 'em

407
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:26,862
and leave 'em.

408
00:28:27,072 --> 00:28:29,802
- Nice attitude.
- Sorry, it's just how I am.

409
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:34,638
I gotta say, you do everything
to get us males excited.

410
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:36,711
Why the lipstick, the nail polish,

411
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,644
the tight-fitting bras,
the short skirts?

412
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,648
Why the high heels?
Why wear stockings?

413
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:43,377
Why not wear socks, like us?

414
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:45,988
Yeah, a girl looks great
in kneesocks.

415
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,091
A real tease!

416
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:49,988
Once all my underwear was dirty,

417
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:53,164
so I tried on my sister's silk panties.
What a feeling!

418
00:28:53,364 --> 00:28:56,492
No wonder they always want it!

419
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:58,931
We men wear pants,

420
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,800
but in their dresses,
their thighs are always touching.

421
00:29:03,007 --> 00:29:06,773
It must be torture for priests.
Right, lovebirds?

422
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:09,446
Priests wear long drawers,
jerk face.

423
00:29:10,615 --> 00:29:12,480
The light's red, damn it!

424
00:29:23,561 --> 00:29:26,496
Now we're done for!
We'll do the talking, okay?

425
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:28,222
Open up!

426
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:31,561
The door!
Help me, damn it!

427
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,704
Anything wrong, Officer?

428
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,370
Turn off the engine and get out.

429
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,312
I can explain.

430
00:29:42,514 --> 00:29:44,106
Your papers.

431
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,509
He's an awful driver, Officer.

432
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,850
He goes crazy in traffic.

433
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:54,848
Coming, dear?
We've had enough.

434
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:56,788
Let's catch a bus.

435
00:29:56,995 --> 00:29:58,986
- Don't look at me!
- So long, Charlie!

436
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,425
See you later.

437
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,999
- Sure, drop by. We'll be waiting.
- See you soon!

438
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,846
- “See you soon," they said.
- Don't worry about it.

439
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,020
Don't worry. Right.

440
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:26,190
And I suppose those were
cap pistols they had too.

441
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:29,559
<i>She took your arm
just like that.</i>

442
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:31,859
<i>My God, she's taking you
to her place.</i>

443
00:30:32,864 --> 00:30:34,593
This way.

444
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,769
Let me lead the way.

445
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:44,742
<i>Don't stare at her legs.
It isn't proper.</i>

446
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,672
<i>Watch the steps or you'll fall.</i>

447
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,779
<i>Or look at the walls,
though they're pretty cruddy.</i>

448
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:59,046
Now Charlie plays the piano at Plyne's,
but there was a time when he didn't.

449
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,218
Isn't that right, Edouard?

450
00:31:03,228 --> 00:31:04,718
<i>There was a time...</i>

451
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,525
<i>There was a time...</i>

452
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:12,736
Excuse me.

453
00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:17,006
Do you have caramel custard?
- No, it's crossed off the menu.

454
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,005
- So I see.
- Check, please.

455
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,441
- Too bad.
- Excuse me.

456
00:31:25,083 --> 00:31:28,052
- What time are you off?
- I'll have a look.

457
00:31:29,754 --> 00:31:31,585
Miss, please!

458
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:34,589
Coffee, sir?

459
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,157
Here.
Take this for your trouble.

460
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,392
It's too beautiful.

461
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:49,195
<i>But you thought to yourself,
“Not for two years of happiness. "</i>

462
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,439
We never accept gifts
from customers, sir.

463
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,718
- Has that guy been coming long?
- The last few days.

464
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,254
I've seen him somewhere before.

465
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,725
You know what I'd like?

466
00:32:09,027 --> 00:32:12,895
Quit your job at the restaurant.
- Your piano <i>lessons</i> aren't exactly -

467
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:16,294
Don't make fun
of my piano lessons.

468
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,664
You used to like them.
- It's true. Remember?

469
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:23,705
“Mr. Edouard, perhaps I could learn.
I know I'm slow, but -”

470
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:26,240
“Don't say that, miss.
You're not slow at all.

471
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,775
It's just that the piano -”

472
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:31,278
“I just love my lessons.
They take up all my afternoons."

473
00:32:31,482 --> 00:32:35,282
“You really like the piano, miss?”
“Oh, yes, Mr. Edouard."

474
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:39,721
Tell me.

475
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,753
You really want me around
all the time?

476
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,657
It's more than that.
Much more.

477
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,758
I know,
and I feel the same way.

478
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,033
It gets stronger every day.

479
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,769
I recommend the special.

480
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:04,441
Allow me to introduce myself:
Lars Schmeel, impresario.

481
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,310
- Edouard Saroyan.
- I remember.

482
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:10,817
You're a pianist.
You came to see me a year ago.

483
00:33:11,022 --> 00:33:11,989
That's right.

484
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:16,991
I was too busy to give you much time.
Forgive me.

485
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,060
- I understand.
- Life can be crazy.

486
00:33:19,263 --> 00:33:22,130
May I?
- Be my guest.

487
00:33:22,533 --> 00:33:24,262
Would the gentlemen
care to order?

488
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:27,563
I should explain:
This is my wife.

489
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,002
Nice to meet you, little lady.

490
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:33,507
We play this little game
of waitress and customer.

491
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:37,579
A splendid game -
you both win!

492
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,782
You're very lucky, my friend.

493
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,009
You're very kind.

494
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,782
Let me redeem myself.
Come to my office tomorrow.

495
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,515
With whom did you study?

496
00:33:48,726 --> 00:33:50,284
Old Zeleny.

497
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,335
- What are you sulking about?
- I'm not.

498
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,909
Yes, you are.
You were in a good mood in the car.

499
00:36:55,112 --> 00:36:57,444
Then you suddenly stopped talking
as if I'd said something.

500
00:36:57,648 --> 00:37:01,277
It's nothing you said.
I just realized you weren't listening.

501
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,750
You pretend to, but you don't care.
“He's talking away, so he's happy."

502
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,720
You're thinking about tablecloths,
furniture, dressmakers.

503
00:37:07,925 --> 00:37:10,393
I'm telling you
what I liked about the concert,

504
00:37:10,595 --> 00:37:13,530
when I catch your look that <i>says,</i>
“Keep talking, buddy!"

505
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:14,925
I'm not done!

506
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,499
I'm fed up, you hear me?
This is no life for an artist.

507
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,797
Maybe I'm not a real artist,
but people gotta believe in me

508
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:26,033
so I can become one.
I'm not asking for much, damn it!

509
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,772
Think it doesn't take all the patience
I've got to live with you?

510
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,246
And the brilliant conversation
you make.

511
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,251
Mention Hemingway and it's
“I hear he has all my records.”

512
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:39,116
“So-and-so didn't like
my last recital.”

513
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:41,951
“Smith told Jones
I was the tops.”

514
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:44,127
“Should I accept this offer,
decline that one?”

515
00:37:44,328 --> 00:37:47,627
“What's John Doe think of me?”
“Did the concierge see me on TV?”

516
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:52,327
My God, you repeat
everything ten times.

517
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:55,300
I have to act
like I've never heard it before.

518
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,773
You think this is
any sort of life?

519
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,376
Isn't it getting to be a bit much?

520
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,841
I'd rather you were more smug,

521
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:08,541
more sure of your talent.

522
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:10,948
At least I'd have some peace.

523
00:38:11,155 --> 00:38:13,555
The slightest criticism
crushes you.

524
00:38:16,427 --> 00:38:19,954
Forgive me.
It's just my jealousy talking.

525
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:22,894
No, everything you say is true.

526
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,297
I think about it too,
but what can I do?

527
00:38:27,038 --> 00:38:29,563
I'm not the guy for you.
- Don't say that.

528
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,901
It hurts too much.

529
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,888
<i>You lucky stifi'! What a triumph!
You and your wife must be ecstatic.</i>

530
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:50,959
<i>But your press conference
was a total flop.</i>

531
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:54,425
<i>Reporters come running
to see the rare bird,</i>

532
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,226
but they can't get
a word out of you.

533
00:38:57,435 --> 00:38:59,995
<i>Shyness is</i> a <i>disease.
It can be cured.</i>

534
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:05,039
Luckily, I'm doing your work for you.
Look here in the gossip pages.

535
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,205
“Lars Schmeel,
Saroyan's manager, told us,

536
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,315
'I love beauty in all,
regardless of gender.”'

537
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:17,311
HOW TO CONQUER SHYNESS

538
00:39:44,014 --> 00:39:45,845
HOW I GOT OVER MY FEAR

539
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:13,837
Now, Edouard,
you'll never escape from me again,

540
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:17,946
thanks to this masterpiece
that I can contemplate every day.

541
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:22,976
How's Thérésa?
- Tired.

542
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,623
She's always tired.
- Too much travel? Life on the road?

543
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,622
- No, it's me.
- Do you two argue?

544
00:40:29,827 --> 00:40:33,763
We used to, in the beginning.
Now it's much more serious.

545
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,525
You can tell me everything.

546
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:45,565
- She's through with me.
- Come, now.

547
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:50,236
You don't believe it.
I couldn't either at first.

548
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,811
It's like she's struggling
with something.

549
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,552
I can tell.

550
00:40:57,555 --> 00:40:59,614
For example, we'll be talking,

551
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:02,384
when suddenly she turns
and walks out of the room.

552
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:07,160
If I try to stop her, she locks herself
in her room and doesn't answer.

553
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:11,899
That's where things stand.
It's over.

554
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:14,764
- Did she tell you that?
- She didn't have to.

555
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:21,601
I think she began to despise me
when I became successful.

556
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,939
I think it's all a misunderstanding.

557
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:27,777
Bring her to the cocktail reception
later and I'll talk to her.

558
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,714
I'll try.

559
00:41:54,712 --> 00:41:58,307
Listen, I've come to take you
to the party.

560
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,178
Please leave me alone.
Go away.

561
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:03,012
I've had enough!

562
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,088
Why are you shouting at me?
You never used to.

563
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,450
I didn't mean to.

564
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:12,460
It's all right.
After all, you can shout if you like.

565
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:15,692
I'm making you unhappy, aren't I?

566
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:19,092
I know it's wrong,
but I can't help myself.

567
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:23,573
Lost in the night, you can't stop
the shadows from closing in.

568
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:26,470
It gets darker and darker.

569
00:42:27,344 --> 00:42:30,142
There's no way out.
You don't know what to do.

570
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:34,741
I think there's
only one thing I can do.

571
00:42:35,986 --> 00:42:37,510
Say good-bye and go.

572
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:42,986
All right, I'll tell you.

573
00:42:43,193 --> 00:42:45,218
You must know.

574
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,920
It's better to tell...
to confess.

575
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:49,863
Confess?

576
00:42:50,668 --> 00:42:52,533
I made a mistake.

577
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,564
I did a terrible thing.

578
00:42:56,440 --> 00:43:00,934
But now you're a famous pianist,
and I'm glad.

579
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,977
I gave you your chance.

580
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,477
Lars Schmeel.

581
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:12,046
It was a few days
before you signed the contract.

582
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,347
He came to the restaurant.

583
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:16,291
Not for coffee.

584
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:18,723
Not for lunch either.

585
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,065
To make a business proposition.

586
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,502
At first I don't understand.

587
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,130
It's like some kind of riddle.

588
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:32,672
I ask him what he means.

589
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,802
He looks at me as if to say,

590
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,141
“You don't get it? Think about it.
You'll figure it out."

591
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:44,580
I lay awake all night
thinking about it.

592
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,948
He came back the next day.

593
00:43:49,393 --> 00:43:52,487
You know how a spider works?

594
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:55,796
It was like
he'd cut me in two.

595
00:43:56,467 --> 00:44:00,369
As if my heart were one thing
and my body another.

596
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,737
It wasn't Thérésa
who went with him.

597
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,736
Just her body,

598
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:11,044
as if I wasn't there.

599
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,580
I was with you.

600
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,880
I was leading you
onto the concert stage.

601
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:21,152
He'd rented a room
near the restaurant that afternoon.

602
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,022
Then one evening
you tell me the news:

603
00:44:27,131 --> 00:44:29,065
The contract is signed.

604
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:34,394
Afterward, when he came
to the restaurant,

605
00:44:35,406 --> 00:44:37,806
he was a customer
like any other...

606
00:44:38,776 --> 00:44:40,937
ordering a meal.

607
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:45,608
I thought, “That's over and done with.
Now you can be Thérésa again."

608
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,712
But it's strange.

609
00:44:50,154 --> 00:44:53,749
What you did yesterday
stays with you today.

610
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:58,527
I look in the mirror.

611
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:02,654
Do I see Thérésa?
Your Thérésa?

612
00:45:06,837 --> 00:45:08,429
There's no Thérésa...

613
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:11,369
anywhere.

614
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,376
Just a dirty old rag.

615
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:24,845
That's why I won't
let you touch me.

616
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,754
Not this filth!

617
00:45:28,358 --> 00:45:30,986
<i>Go to her, bow your head,
get down on your knees.</i>

618
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:33,493
<i>Quick, before it's too late,
think fast!</i>

619
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:36,928
<i>If you walk out that door,
she'll be all alone. Don't do it!</i>

620
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:00,516
WIFE OF FAMED PIANIST
PLUNGES TO HER DEATH

621
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:07,997
<i>You disappeared
and started over.</i>

622
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,798
<i>Edouard Saroyan
became Charlie Koller.</i>

623
00:46:11,068 --> 00:46:14,765
<i>You visited your brothers in the snow
and asked them to let you have Fido.</i>

624
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,837
<i>One day you ended up at the bar.</i>

625
00:46:17,307 --> 00:46:20,140
<i>They were happy to have you
sweep out the old dive.</i>

626
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:23,745
<i>There was a beat-up wreck
of a piano in the comer.</i>

627
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:28,850
<i>You couldn't stop looking at it,
looking away, looking back again.</i>

628
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:33,115
<i>One day you asked Plyne -</i>

629
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,416
Mind if I play a bit?

630
00:46:36,059 --> 00:46:38,653
- You?
- I think I can play it.

631
00:46:38,996 --> 00:46:41,760
All right.
But it better be music.

632
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,065
<i>Who is Charlie Koller?</i>

633
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,465
<i>All we know is
he's the piano man</i>

634
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:28,406
<i>who's raising his kid brother
and who minds his own business.</i>

635
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:32,446
<i>Your music brings in the locals
every night, and the joint takes off.</i>

636
00:47:32,649 --> 00:47:34,879
<i>Plyne hires more help
and musicians.</i>

637
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,883
<i>Victor, on drums,
grins all the time for no reason.</i>

638
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:42,752
<i>His brother, Frangois, is on bass,
with his long, hairy hands.</i>

639
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,484
<i>And then there was me,</i>

640
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:47,129
<i>watching you the whole time,
but you never noticed.</i>

641
00:48:44,988 --> 00:48:48,480
On my birthday, when I said,
“Everyone gets a big kiss,”

642
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,990
it was so I could kiss you.

643
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,687
I saw you looking at me...

644
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:57,227
so I looked back.

645
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,207
What were you thinking last night,
walking me home?

646
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:09,602
Did you like me
right from the start?

647
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:13,114
Remember that night you told me -

648
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:20,915
When I took your arm, I was afraid
you'd think I was too forward.

649
00:49:24,494 --> 00:49:26,894
I wanted so badly
for you to take my hand.

650
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:11,097
You know, I've got a feeling
Plyne is crazy about you.

651
00:50:11,308 --> 00:50:12,673
You're nuts!
That's all I need!

652
00:50:12,876 --> 00:50:15,674
It's true.
He told me so himself.

653
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,747
After all,
he's a man like any other.

654
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,376
I love you because
you aren't like the others.

655
00:50:23,587 --> 00:50:26,351
You don't play the ladies' man
or the tough guy.

656
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,690
You're shy.
You respect woman.

657
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:31,951
Don't you believe it.

658
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,327
Deep down
I'm just like the others.

659
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:40,126
When I was rich and famous and
women recognized me in the street,

660
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:43,397
I'd stare at them shamelessly,
as if wanting to undress them.

661
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:47,706
Since most of them stared back
and seemed to enjoy it,

662
00:50:47,911 --> 00:50:50,038
I got bolder and bolder.

663
00:50:51,915 --> 00:50:55,009
But if it was a decent girl
and she looked away,

664
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:58,283
I felt ashamed.

665
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:02,617
I'd never let anyone treat my mother
or wife or daughter like that.

666
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,866
Where there's a will, there's a way.
We'll go quit Plyne's place.

667
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,435
We'll be free
and work as a team!

668
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:17,971
I'm going to wake you up.
You'll be Edouard Saroyan again.

669
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:19,776
What for?

670
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,709
Not what for - who for.

671
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,542
For me and you.
For us.

672
00:51:27,818 --> 00:51:30,218
I was an orphan.
I'm used to fighting.

673
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:34,620
You'll work, audition,
give concerts.

674
00:51:36,293 --> 00:51:37,783
Charlie's dead!
Long live Edouard!

675
00:51:43,066 --> 00:51:45,694
Be an angel
and go buy me a pair of stockings.

676
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,637
Then we'll go
tell off that swine Plyne.

677
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,240
Get “Scandals” in size two.

678
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,875
Tangerine's my shade.

679
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:14,455
All I ask of a man
is to tell me when it's over.

680
00:52:15,065 --> 00:52:17,226
Not one ever has.

681
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:21,268
When you don't love me anymore,
tell me.

682
00:53:01,077 --> 00:53:02,601
Wait, I'll fix your eggs.

683
00:53:02,812 --> 00:53:05,372
I don't like the white,
just the yolk.

684
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,414
There's a customer for you,
Miss Clarisse.

685
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:14,249
Why doesn't he come
during working hours?

686
00:53:14,457 --> 00:53:16,618
Tell him to find someone else.

687
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:19,687
The sidewalks full of 'em.
What nerve!

688
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:22,660
He insists on you.
He made that very clear.

689
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,825
He's clean and well-dressed.
A nice-looking man.

690
00:53:27,270 --> 00:53:28,999
All right, I'm on my way.

691
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:34,337
There's sugar, yogurt and fruit.
I'll be back in a flash.

692
00:53:34,945 --> 00:53:36,412
This is the gentleman.

693
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,274
I'll be right back, Fido.

694
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:41,277
Hello, miss.
Where do we go?

695
00:53:41,484 --> 00:53:45,250
This way, honey. You look familiar.
Haven't you been up before?

696
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,717
No, miss.

697
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,084
- You have money?
- A little.

698
00:53:57,133 --> 00:53:59,658
Hey, honey, where are you going?

699
00:54:00,136 --> 00:54:03,003
Damn it! What's going on?

700
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:05,197
- Ernest!
- I'm coming.

701
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,309
Fido, don't go with them!

702
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:18,178
Damn you!

703
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:20,288
Filthy creeps!

704
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,849
Kidnappers!

705
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,098
My carriage.

706
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,743
- So we're really quitting?
- Don't get cold feet.

707
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,913
Let me handle it.
Just watch Plyne.

708
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:45,679
Here they are.

709
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:50,549
- Think you're on vacation or what?
- I got up late.

710
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:54,451
And then we took a drive,
and then we took a walk.

711
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:55,750
Together?

712
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,257
Yes, together.
You want a diagram?

713
00:54:58,461 --> 00:55:02,227
Why not? I'm curious.
He's usually by himself.

714
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,764
Even with someone else around,
he's by himself.

715
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:08,335
We came for our pay.
And by the way, we're quitting too.

716
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,766
That's all I need.

717
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,703
Crap from the customers,
and now from the help too!

718
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,103
Did you hear that?

719
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,305
Charlie,
where you been hiding out?

720
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,483
I looked everywhere for you. Those
two guys last night got me worried.

721
00:55:20,684 --> 00:55:24,882
Where could he hide?
They had his address, and mine too.

722
00:55:25,088 --> 00:55:26,316
I know nothing about this.

723
00:55:26,856 --> 00:55:28,983
Ask this joker you live with.

724
00:55:29,192 --> 00:55:30,955
You call this living?

725
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:33,186
- Shut your traps, both of you!
- You shut yours!

726
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:37,799
Those guys came here this morning
and shelled out for our addresses.

727
00:55:38,702 --> 00:55:39,726
You sold them?

728
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,836
Meet Plyne,
the double-crosser!

729
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,528
It wasn't like that.

730
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,709
<i>Plyne's been a bastard,
but she's torturing him.</i>

731
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:49,845
<i>He sees her every day
and wants her, but not a chance.</i>

732
00:55:50,046 --> 00:55:52,947
<i>Even now, she's laying into him,
but he can't tear his eyes away.</i>

733
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:55,242
<i>She's going too far,
but what can I tell her?</i>

734
00:55:55,452 --> 00:56:00,014
<i>That's he's not so bad?
A poor slob who never got anywhere?</i>

735
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,415
<i>It's all true,
but there's no point.</i>

736
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:05,389
<i>It's none of your business.
Nothing is.</i>

737
00:56:05,595 --> 00:56:08,496
<i>Just take your place
at the piano.</i>

738
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,996
<i>You can't help Plyne
or anybody else.</i>

739
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:14,500
<i>You're out of it now.
For you, nothing matters anymore.</i>

740
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:33,184
- Take back what you said.
- Screw you!

741
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,689
Feel my muscles, Léna.
I'm not just anybody.

742
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,724
This is bullshit!

743
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:41,658
She's right.
It's bullshit!

744
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:46,426
“Screw you,” “bullshit” -
such filth from such a lovely mouth.

745
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:49,264
Why don't you keep yours shut,
you fat pig!

746
00:56:49,472 --> 00:56:51,440
As sure as you see me here,
I'm gonna kill you.

747
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,769
- I don't see you. You're too short.
- Your loss, you bitch!

748
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,570
Charlie, you sleep-walking?

749
00:56:57,781 --> 00:56:59,749
Just leave her alone.

750
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:03,112
Okay, sure.
It's you I'm after now anyway.

751
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,718
You bastard,
you touched her!

752
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:09,358
Admit you defiled her.
I'll break your neck!

753
00:57:44,561 --> 00:57:46,028
Let's stop this.

754
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,157
You're not angry?

755
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:49,592
- Let's forget it.
- No way.

756
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,934
Someone must win.
- Say I chickened out.

757
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,366
No, the ladies saw me run out.

758
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,205
I can't back down now.
I've got to show them.

759
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,501
I don't want people believing
everything she said.

760
00:58:05,915 --> 00:58:09,908
I don't love Léna anymore.
She used words unworthy of her.

761
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:14,745
If she had a soul,
she wouldn't have been so vulgar.

762
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:16,892
She's a slut!

763
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,188
She's not a girl,
she's not a woman.

764
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:24,492
A woman is pure,
delicate, fragile.

765
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:27,693
Woman is supreme.
Woman is magic.

766
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:31,870
To me, woman has always
been supreme.

767
00:58:32,141 --> 00:58:34,905
Charlie boy -
sorry for getting familiar -

768
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:37,772
but Charlie boy,
you're about to die!

769
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:34,225
Go back inside.
It was just an accident.

770
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:21,649
- Someone's there!
- Shit, I forgot the light!

771
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:24,376
Must be the police.
I'll go.

772
01:00:24,587 --> 01:00:26,782
Look, his eyes are open.

773
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:30,983
Move.

774
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,453
Don't push. I've got legs.

775
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,998
Then use them.
You're worse than a drunk.

776
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:43,502
I dropped the knife to show him
I wasn't serious.

777
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,165
Then he started choking me.

778
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:49,869
I found the knife and meant
to nick his arm to make him let go.

779
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,347
He moved
and caught it in the back.

780
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:54,811
- Wanna bet?
- On what?

781
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:58,852
- They'll buy it.
- No, the police will want proof.

782
01:00:59,055 --> 01:01:01,148
It was me.
They won't look any further.

783
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:04,724
- You can explain.
- Sure - by mail.

784
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:07,293
Go get Fido
before the cops get there.

785
01:01:20,576 --> 01:01:22,942
Fido!

786
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,746
- What do you want?
- You scared me!

787
01:01:28,951 --> 01:01:31,784
Sorry.
I'm looking for Fido Saroyan.

788
01:01:31,988 --> 01:01:36,049
Fido's gone!
Those two bastards kidnapped him!

789
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,453
You're drunk!

790
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,563
Damn those dogs!

791
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:55,141
- Fido sounds like a dog's name.
- It means “faithful.”

792
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:57,744
The milk trick was good,
but we won the second round.

793
01:01:57,947 --> 01:01:59,972
Here's a tip:
Never leave the door open.

794
01:02:00,183 --> 01:02:04,347
My pop used to say, “lf someone
knocks, assume it's a murderer.

795
01:02:04,554 --> 01:02:06,351
If it's just a robber,
you'll be happy."

796
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,046
- How's school?
- So-so.

797
01:02:08,257 --> 01:02:10,555
- What's your best subject?
- Natural science.

798
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,127
I was no good in any subject.
Work gives me a migraine.

799
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,798
I'm making up for all my ancestors
who overworked,

800
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,490
all those generations
of hard-working men.

801
01:02:19,769 --> 01:02:20,633
Here.

802
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,202
Thanks. I prefer snuff.

803
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:24,373
You put tobacco up your nose?
Disgusting.

804
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:29,307
It's great, especially in the morning.
The first pinch is always the best.

805
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,573
- What's that?
- A musical lighter.

806
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,014
- That's great.
- Show him your watch.

807
01:02:37,220 --> 01:02:38,812
Look.

808
01:02:39,355 --> 01:02:43,155
And I've got a gadget that rings
when the parking meter is up.

809
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:45,888
Is that it?

810
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:48,962
A new Snorkel-brand pen
from America

811
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:51,656
with automatic refill
and retractable nib.

812
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,797
A fiber belt from Oceania.

813
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,639
A hat for the tropics.

814
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:02,277
My suit's from London,
made of Australian wool.

815
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:05,379
I have vented shoes
of Egyptian leather.

816
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:08,311
I've got so much stuff

817
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,349
I could puke.

818
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:14,450
My scarf looks like silk,
but it's really metal.

819
01:03:14,657 --> 01:03:18,058
A really flexible metal.

820
01:03:18,261 --> 01:03:19,853
It's Japanese. Feel it.

821
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:23,122
- It's not metal, it's cloth.
- It's Japanese metal!

822
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:26,130
No, it's not.
It's not even Japanese.

823
01:03:26,335 --> 01:03:29,702
- I swear it's the truth.
- No reason to lie about it.

824
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,204
If I'm lying, may my mother
keel over this instant!

825
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,444
- Okay, I believe you.
- You should.

826
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,963
It's me - Léna.

827
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,372
Come along,
and don't make noise.

828
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,705
Oh, my head!

829
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,570
Shit!

830
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,008
Wait. I'll have a look.

831
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:18,380
Damn it!
The cops are still here!

832
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,853
- What about Fido?
- I'll tell you later.

833
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,194
All clear.

834
01:04:27,230 --> 01:04:28,925
I borrowed a car.

835
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,826
- From whom?
- My landlady.

836
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:34,332
- You must be on good terms.
- I know where she leaves the key.

837
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,335
Can you make it?
Hold on to me.

838
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:50,682
<i>It's all true, Officer.
Just ask the neighbors.</i>

839
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:55,119
<i>You know how it goes.
One thing leads to another.</i>

840
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:19,077
The cops?

841
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:22,115
They really grilled me.
They're at the neighbors' now.

842
01:05:22,318 --> 01:05:25,719
You may need this.
- I'll call from the road.

843
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,720
- Fido.
- I'll explain later.

844
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:40,429
You got the bottle?

845
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,632
Here.

846
01:05:48,377 --> 01:05:50,277
Have some.

847
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,704
I'm still thirsty.

848
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:00,978
I was a prize jerk not to see it.

849
01:06:01,190 --> 01:06:03,590
They went from Chico
to me to Fido.

850
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:07,957
The abominable Saroyan brothers
are in the soup again.

851
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:18,364
She's conking out again.

852
01:06:18,574 --> 01:06:19,939
For the third time!

853
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:22,610
What a crate!
We'd do better in a pushcart.

854
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:25,975
- What's wrong with it?
- How should I know?

855
01:06:26,182 --> 01:06:28,844
- We'll have to push.
- Come on.

856
01:06:29,051 --> 01:06:31,747
Can you see?
- Yeah.

857
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:36,386
Look where you're heading!
Hold it straight.

858
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,688
Come on, push!

859
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:44,926
Careful.
You're veering to the side.

860
01:06:45,134 --> 01:06:47,261
Funny thing, an engine.

861
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:53,631
- What about that? Or that?
- Don't touch.

862
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:06,453
- Does the radio work?
- I don't know. Try it.

863
01:07:07,223 --> 01:07:12,058
<i>Off in the distance
far from the violins</i>

864
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:17,299
<i>Far from the shepherds too</i>

865
01:07:17,733 --> 01:07:22,067
<i>Dressed in knightly garb</i>

866
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:29,438
<i>Forty of the king's jesters</i>

867
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:33,975
<i>Painted in brightest hue</i>

868
01:07:35,051 --> 01:07:38,612
<i>And angels</i>

869
01:07:39,321 --> 01:07:42,256
<i>Hovering over us</i>

870
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:48,155
<i>There on the horizon</i>

871
01:07:51,267 --> 01:07:56,728
<i>When my love turns to hate
you'll be sure to know</i>

872
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:03,208
<i>When my love turns to hate
I'll wear a cap as I go</i>

873
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:10,350
<i>When you stop loving me
I'll make it very plain</i>

874
01:08:10,553 --> 01:08:17,721
<i>When you stop loving me
my hair will hang free</i>

875
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:22,657
<i>My love now wears
her hair piled high</i>

876
01:08:22,865 --> 01:08:25,891
<i>In every kind of weather</i>

877
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:32,105
<i>His head is bared for me</i>

878
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,433
Stop.

879
01:08:34,643 --> 01:08:36,235
- We're not there yet.
- I said stop!

880
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,641
What are you doing?

881
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:45,378
We split up here.
Take the car back to your landlady.

882
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,552
Look at me.

883
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,857
<i>Parting would be easier
if she'd let you drink the whole bottle.</i>

884
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,191
Turn left at the crossroads.

885
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,364
I know the way.

886
01:08:57,867 --> 01:08:59,300
What are you waiting for?

887
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:03,529
<i>She knows you want her to stay,
but it can't be.</i>

888
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:06,570
Thanks for the ride.

889
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:37,733
- Hi, Richard.
- Well, well.

890
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:40,105
You here alone?
I heard a car.

891
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:44,075
- A friend brought me.
- I see.

892
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:46,373
Sorry, but we're all
on a short fuse up here.

893
01:09:46,582 --> 01:09:50,348
Some guys are gunning for Chico.
He must have told you.

894
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:52,817
He's here?
When did he get here?

895
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:56,685
This afternoon, half dead
from hitching and running.

896
01:09:56,892 --> 01:10:00,760
He's better now, catching a snooze.
He ate enough grub for four.

897
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:02,863
Aren't Mom and Dad here?

898
01:10:03,065 --> 01:10:06,762
- We moved 'em down to the village.
- Are you nuts?

899
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:09,802
You think I enjoyed it?
I like them too.

900
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:12,838
We've got nice old folks.
Never a pain in the ass.

901
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:15,408
But they're not bullet-proof!

902
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:20,640
No visitors?

903
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:23,618
So we got here first.

904
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,687
What a Knucklehead, that Chico.

905
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:30,882
Don't stick up for him.
He always botches everything.

906
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:33,323
If jackasses could fly,
he'd be squadron commander.

907
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:38,398
- He was in a jam.
- He's always in a jam. You know why?

908
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,265
'Cause he always messes up!
- It's not his fault I killed a guy.

909
01:10:43,472 --> 01:10:46,635
- What?
- That's right.

910
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:48,204
Yesterday evening.

911
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:50,940
We're in a nice fix.

912
01:10:51,146 --> 01:10:56,140
Those two guys have snatched Fido.
Meanwhile, the cops are on your tail.

913
01:10:57,853 --> 01:10:59,616
But hey, you know what?

914
01:10:59,822 --> 01:11:01,346
I'm happy to see you again.

915
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:04,617
- Likewise.
- “Me too,” as the Brits say.

916
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:06,556
Is that coffee I smell?

917
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:08,730
Damn it!
“Boiled coffee, spoiled coffee!”

918
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,992
I tell you, a guy goes stir-crazy
after a while

919
01:11:14,203 --> 01:11:16,637
when he can't move freely.

920
01:11:17,072 --> 01:11:20,940
You hate waking up in the morning,
feeling like a prisoner.

921
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:23,475
At first Chico and I
had some good laughs.

922
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,738
We thought it was funny.

923
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:30,246
I'll wake Chico up
and tell him you're here.

924
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:46,191
- You're here?
- Yeah. How's the shiner?

925
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,302
Okay.
Doesn't hurt anymore.

926
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:50,096
What's that?

927
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:54,003
The loot.
That's what I went to Paris for.

928
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:57,542
They're new bills,
all marked and numbered.

929
01:11:57,746 --> 01:12:01,512
Gotta come up with a good scheme
to unload them.

930
01:12:01,717 --> 01:12:06,086
Richard and me, we'd gone straight
and got a good, honest job.

931
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:08,415
At an exchange house.

932
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,684
One day these two guys
stick us up.

933
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:13,494
We laughed

934
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:16,597
and said we could teach 'em
a thing or two about stick-ups.

935
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:20,860
So they said,
“Then how about a four-way split?”

936
01:12:21,070 --> 01:12:23,231
Richard and I
looked at each other.

937
01:12:23,439 --> 01:12:27,432
It was too good to pass up,
so we took off with the two guys.

938
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:30,703
We thought we'd lay low up here.

939
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:36,376
Well, right off, right in the car,
they started griping.

940
01:12:37,086 --> 01:12:40,647
“It's too far.”
“What's with all the snow?”

941
01:12:42,391 --> 01:12:46,225
So we dumped them
and kept the bundle for ourselves.

942
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:50,728
Now they want our hides.

943
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,958
We should have
bumped them off first.

944
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:56,296
Like Charlie here.
He killed some guy.

945
01:12:58,273 --> 01:13:00,366
No shit!

946
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:02,834
It can't be.

947
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,775
I gotta say,
I'm glad to hear it.

948
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,716
Now you're just like us.

949
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:15,719
Remember the slingshots?

950
01:13:15,924 --> 01:13:17,289
What slingshots?

951
01:13:17,493 --> 01:13:20,894
And those characters
in the limousine who came for you?

952
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:23,564
The young prodigy.
The 14-year old virtuoso.

953
01:13:23,766 --> 01:13:26,098
To take you to the old man
at the music school?

954
01:13:26,602 --> 01:13:28,194
Yeah, Zeleny.

955
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,099
And as we drove
through the woods,

956
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,035
you two bombarded
the car with rocks.

957
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:35,676
The guys in the car
didn't know who you were.

958
01:13:35,878 --> 01:13:40,941
But the dame with the blue hair
and dark glasses asked who you were.

959
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:43,846
I said, “Who? Those boys?”

960
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:46,111
She said, “Those aren't boys,
they're wild beasts.

961
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,555
And what did you say?

962
01:13:49,124 --> 01:13:52,924
“Those are my brothers, ma'am.”
She quickly changed the subject.

963
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:58,122
She talked about the academy
and my great teacher and all that jazz.

964
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,999
Rocks kept bouncing off the car
the whole time,

965
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,764
as if you and Richard
were talking to me,

966
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:09,069
telling me I was bound
to come back someday for good.

967
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:11,569
Back to the wild beasts.

968
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,044
You had to come back, Charlie,
'cause we're all alike -

969
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,809
you, me, Richard, even Fido.

970
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,385
Listen, let's hit the sack.

971
01:14:19,588 --> 01:14:22,148
Chico, you're on watch.

972
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,484
Go on to bed. I'm not sleepy.
I want a smoke.

973
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:26,786
Then I'll leave this with you.

974
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,889
Man's best friend.

975
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:42,026
<i>So now you ire a killer
in a family of thieves- No problem!</i>

976
01:15:42,771 --> 01:15:45,535
Only there is a problem:
all this craziness.

977
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,335
<i>Where did you and your brothers
get it from?</i>

978
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:52,578
<i>Not Mom, not Dad. Must have
skipped a generation or two.</i>

979
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:55,113
<i>It can resurface
after hundreds of years.</i>

980
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:58,753
<i>Some Saroyans long ago probably
did some crazy things</i>

981
01:15:58,954 --> 01:16:01,115
<i>and then hid out,
like us now.</i>

982
01:16:01,323 --> 01:16:04,724
<i>It'd make a good poem.
A comic one, of course.</i>

983
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:07,324
<i>And this useless gun?</i>

984
01:16:07,529 --> 01:16:09,895
<i>“I 'II leave this for you.
Man's best friend. "</i>

985
01:16:10,599 --> 01:16:14,467
<i>He says that to me,
who hates guns!</i>

986
01:16:34,623 --> 01:16:36,648
- Where's Fido?
- No sign of him.

987
01:16:36,858 --> 01:16:39,952
We had it figured wrong.
- We're leaving. I'm taking you back.

988
01:16:40,162 --> 01:16:42,460
- And the cops?
- You can stop worrying.

989
01:16:42,664 --> 01:16:45,792
You're cleared. Self-defense.
The neighbors backed your story.

990
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:49,164
You threw the knife down,
but Plyne tried to strangle you.

991
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:52,169
You only meant to jab his arm.
It was an accident.

992
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,638
I'd never have thought.
Where's the car?

993
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,834
Over there. Come on.

994
01:16:57,045 --> 01:16:59,206
I have to tell them first.
Wait for me.

995
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:01,905
You'll come back?
You swear?

996
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:04,648
You know...

997
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:09,182
“When my love turns to hate,
I'll wear a cap as I go.”

998
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,812
Goddamn it!

999
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,225
Hell, it's snowing!

1000
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,132
Not like that, honey.
You'll break the glasses.

1001
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:41,234
Like this.
And set them down gently.

1002
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:44,337
Charlie, meet the new waitress.

1003
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:46,564
Charlie, the piano player.
