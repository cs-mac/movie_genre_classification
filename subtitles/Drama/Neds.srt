00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:03,032
- Which primary?
- Blessed Mary's Primary, sir.

154
00:15:10,711 --> 00:15:14,159
- Are you related to Benjamin McGill'?
- He's my big brother, sir.

155
00:15:14,271 --> 00:15:17,599
- Are you proud of him?
- He's my big brother, sir.

156
00:15:17,711 --> 00:15:21,072
What I'm asking is
are you gonna turn out like him?

157
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:22,992
No, sir.

158
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:27,073
He assaulted two teachers last year
and was expelled indefinitely.

159
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:30,160
- What do you think of that?
- Bad, sir.

160
00:15:30,271 --> 00:15:33,273
Bad that he assaulted two teachers
or that he was expelled?

161
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:35,280
Both ways, sir.

162
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:40,837
- Is he still living at home?
- Sometimes, sir.

163
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,801
Is he in gainful employment?

164
00:15:43,913 --> 00:15:46,553
He's hoping to get work
at the shipyard, sir.

165
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:50,154
Looking for painters and decorators,
are they?

166
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:53,040
Before the Christmas break,

167
00:15:53,154 --> 00:15:56,002
the top two in each class move up
and the bottom two move down.

168
00:15:56,113 --> 00:15:58,558
If you can manage
to come in the top two,

169
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:03,474
and, more importantly, prove to me that
you're a different boy from your brother,

170
00:16:03,593 --> 00:16:05,722
then you can move up to 1A1.

171
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:08,518
- Sir, I just don't understand...
- it's not for you to understand.

172
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:13,076
It's for me to understand.
Now, get back to your class.

173
00:16:22,795 --> 00:16:28,196
Periods 3, 4, 5 and 6,
it's Latin with Mr Bonetti.

174
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:35,404
Well? We're all eager to hear
what the headmaster had to say.

175
00:16:35,516 --> 00:16:39,958
If I work hard and behave myself,
I'm out of here before Christmas.

176
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,605
It's not a bloody prison sentence,
McGill. Sit down.

177
00:16:50,877 --> 00:16:53,322
And copy what you've missed
off one of your classmates,

178
00:16:53,437 --> 00:16:57,442
if they're not intimidated
by your superior intellect!

179
00:16:58,397 --> 00:17:01,202
Periods 7 and 8, music.

180
00:17:01,318 --> 00:17:04,483
Period 9, physical education.

181
00:17:14,678 --> 00:17:17,439
Down here now, cow!

182
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,566
I want you down here now!

183
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,480
I want you here, cow!

184
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:36,760
I want you down here!

185
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,204
Don't make me come up there!

186
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,689
You fat slag!

187
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,484
Shh!

188
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,601
I want you down here, now!

189
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,044
Right now! Fat bitch!

190
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,849
Come down here, right now!

191
00:18:08,161 --> 00:18:10,606
Don't make me come up there!

192
00:18:10,722 --> 00:18:14,563
Don't make me come up there!
You fat slag!

193
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:18,405
Come down here, right now!

194
00:18:18,522 --> 00:18:20,322
Right now!

195
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,850
Fat bitch.

196
00:18:42,603 --> 00:18:45,844
Now... as you can see,

197
00:18:45,964 --> 00:18:49,325
I've written the marks
in the top right-hand corner.

198
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,685
Now some of you,
if not indeed most of you,

199
00:18:53,804 --> 00:18:57,448
might assume that
these are marks out of 10

200
00:18:57,564 --> 00:19:01,166
and thus think that
you have done rather well.

201
00:19:01,284 --> 00:19:06,010
But, in fact,
these are marks out of 100.

202
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:10,245
And you have embarrassed
yourselves.

203
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:16,127
One pupil, however, has embarrassed
himself more than all the others.

204
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:17,806
Stand up, Mr McGill.

205
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:25,611
Now before you all sharpen
your adolescent claws,

206
00:19:25,726 --> 00:19:28,050
let me tell you

207
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:32,728
that the source of this young man's
embarrassment...

208
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:39,811
... lies not in failure
but in a shining success.

209
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:45,409
100 out of 100. Full marks.

210
00:19:47,207 --> 00:19:50,251
Now, this shall no doubt,

211
00:19:50,367 --> 00:19:53,892
result in you singling
Mr McGill out as a swot.

212
00:19:54,007 --> 00:19:59,256
So, I have decided to take it
upon myself to get it in first.

213
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:02,772
You are a swot, Mr McGill.

214
00:20:02,888 --> 00:20:05,496
You have the temerity
to exercise your intelligence

215
00:20:05,608 --> 00:20:08,936
and thus rise above
the mediocrity of your peers.

216
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:13,929
Come on. Up you get.

217
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:18,894
Take your place upon the podium,
up here, on the upper level. Please.

218
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:23,173
An example to you all, boys.

219
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:26,530
Mr McGill... l salute you.

220
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:30,414
Round of applause for Mr McGill.

221
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:35,810
- All right. That's enough.
- Arsehole.

222
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:45,019
Any of those snowballs hit me, you'll
get a toe right up your arse.

223
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:47,018
Youse have been warned.

224
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:56,092
Oi! What one of youse two
threw that?

225
00:20:56,211 --> 00:20:58,459
What's your name?

226
00:21:05,491 --> 00:21:10,337
Right, listen up. I have averaged out
your various class marks.

227
00:21:11,332 --> 00:21:15,054
Top of the class with 87%...

228
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:17,934
... Liam McCole.
Well done, McCole.

229
00:21:20,653 --> 00:21:23,173
Second is 85%...

230
00:21:24,532 --> 00:21:26,453
- ... John McGill.
- Yes!

231
00:21:26,573 --> 00:21:30,021
Sit down, McGill.
Try and curb your enthusiasm.

232
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:33,735
- I thought I was going next door, sir.
- Sit down!

233
00:21:36,653 --> 00:21:41,182
You could show your classmates
a little bit more respect.

234
00:21:41,294 --> 00:21:42,821
Despite what you may think,

235
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,219
they have also worked hard
these last few months.

236
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:53,939
Third place, with 80%,
Stephen McLaughlin.

237
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,375
Fourth with 79%, Dean Walker.

238
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:02,937
Fifth, with 75%, Lloyd Butler.

239
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,943
Also with 75%...

240
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:10,456
Mitchell, Brown.

241
00:22:11,735 --> 00:22:14,059
McCole, McGill.

242
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:34,181
Take your seats.

243
00:22:35,137 --> 00:22:37,298
And stop your crying.

244
00:22:39,017 --> 00:22:41,625
Why, whenever a boy is sent
to this class, he seems to think

245
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:45,785
he's in the beginning of a never-ending
downward spiral to failure?

246
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:48,866
Now I'm starting to take this personally!

247
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:54,664
I am just as good as any other teacher
in this or any other bloody school.

248
00:22:54,778 --> 00:22:56,306
You don't know you're born.

249
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:59,987
You could have had, like me,
an education with the nuns...

250
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,708
Wait! Before you all...
Wait, shut up. Shut your mouth!

251
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:24,547
Before you all go away,
here, book tokens.

252
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,101
Third place...

253
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,381
... McKendrick. There we go.

254
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,824
Second place, Engels.
There you go.

255
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:34,024
And first, McGill.

256
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:37,829
All right, now you can go.
On your way. Enjoy your summers.

257
00:23:37,941 --> 00:23:39,949
John, wait there, please.

258
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:42,542
Have fun.

259
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:50,470
You did very well this year.

260
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:51,990
Thank you, sir.

261
00:23:52,101 --> 00:23:55,266
- Going on holiday with your family?
- No, sir.

262
00:23:55,382 --> 00:23:58,951
Boys your age can find themselves
with nothing to do over the summer.

263
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:01,266
And sometimes they get themselves
into trouble.

264
00:24:01,382 --> 00:24:03,391
So try and keep yourself occupied.

265
00:24:03,502 --> 00:24:06,983
There's a friend of mine runs
a summer school for kids like yourself.

266
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:10,911
Keeps them fit.
I think you'd get a lot out of it.

267
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,910
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

268
00:24:13,023 --> 00:24:15,423
Go. Enjoy yourself.

269
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:22,504
Oh, no, I'm not having this again.

270
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:24,271
No way.

271
00:24:24,383 --> 00:24:28,225
Bad enough your father turning this
place into a doss house without you...

272
00:24:29,864 --> 00:24:32,504
What are you staring at?

273
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:43,749
When you near your illness read out,
put your hand up. Okay?

274
00:24:45,305 --> 00:24:48,349
All right. Er... perforated eardrum?

275
00:24:48,464 --> 00:24:50,145
Okay.

276
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:52,469
Er... . diabetic'? Good.

277
00:24:53,946 --> 00:24:57,111
Okay. Epilepsy? All right, buddy.

278
00:24:57,906 --> 00:25:00,590
And who's the other asthmatic?
Okay.

279
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:03,907
Glass eye?

280
00:25:04,026 --> 00:25:07,910
Oh, that's good.
It looks... a good one.

281
00:25:08,026 --> 00:25:10,187
Er... hole in the heart?

282
00:25:10,306 --> 00:25:12,073
Okay.

283
00:25:12,187 --> 00:25:14,587
- And you've had the operation?
- Aye.

284
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:18,907
Your mammy's happy you're here?
Aye? Good, good, good, okay.

285
00:25:20,627 --> 00:25:23,311
- Right, what have you got?
- I've got verrucas, sir.

286
00:25:23,427 --> 00:25:26,592
"Verrucassir"? Oh, verrucas, right.

287
00:25:27,548 --> 00:25:29,632
What's a "verrucassir"?

288
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,431
Yourself?

289
00:25:35,387 --> 00:25:37,548
Have you?

290
00:25:41,388 --> 00:25:45,797
- You're a bit young, are you?
- Just sort of happened, you know.

291
00:25:50,188 --> 00:25:52,992
How do you spell that, do you know?

292
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:00,190
What about youse boys? You must
have something wrong with you.

293
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,990
No?

294
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,118
Well, you two better keep
eating your porridge,

295
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:08,114
cos it looks as if the future of
the human race is gonna depend on you.

296
00:26:09,949 --> 00:26:13,551
Right, okay.
Fielders, go to the field.

297
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,758
Batters, get behind me... Satan.

298
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,518
This is fucking amazing, man.

299
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:29,639
You're rich.

300
00:26:29,751 --> 00:26:32,719
It's my dad's player
but he lets me borrow his records.

301
00:26:32,831 --> 00:26:34,916
Try them. Sounds fucking amazing.

302
00:26:35,031 --> 00:26:38,316
- Will I take them out?
- Aye. Put them on.

303
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:47,076
Here. You ready?

304
00:26:53,632 --> 00:26:56,360
- This is fucking amazing, man.
- What?

305
00:26:56,472 --> 00:26:58,556
Fucking amazing, man!

306
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:02,797
Bring your friend down for some
juice and biscuits, please, Julian.

307
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:07,394
- We have to go down.
- Down where?

308
00:27:07,513 --> 00:27:09,597
For some juice and biscuits.

309
00:27:12,073 --> 00:27:13,721
There we go.

310
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:19,482
- So what's your name?
- John.

311
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:24,595
- And which school do you go to, John?
- St John of the Cross.

312
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:28,522
Oh, so is that Lourdes Chapel
you attend?

313
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:32,199
- Yeah.
- Oh? Biscuit?

314
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:34,675
Thanks.

315
00:27:36,395 --> 00:27:40,596
- And what does your father do?
- He's a toolmaker.

316
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:43,760
- Do you have brothers and sisters?
- Two.

317
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:46,364
What about your mother?
Does she work?

318
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:48,604
She's part-time.

319
00:27:48,715 --> 00:27:51,116
In a supermarket or something?

320
00:27:51,236 --> 00:27:53,604
No. She's a nurse
in the Southern General.

321
00:27:53,716 --> 00:27:55,124
Oh...

322
00:27:56,756 --> 00:27:59,124
And what do you want to do
when you leave school?

323
00:27:59,237 --> 00:28:03,242
- Go to work with your father?
- No. I want to go to university.

324
00:28:03,356 --> 00:28:05,876
Really? And study what?

325
00:28:08,517 --> 00:28:10,437
I dunno.

326
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,726
Is this one of them?

327
00:28:36,598 --> 00:28:39,567
No. No, he's not one of them.

328
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:42,964
You better not be
pissing me about, son.

329
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:45,479
- What you running for?
- Don't know.

330
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,922
- Where do you stay?
- Dove Street.

331
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:50,964
- What's your name? Name?
- John McGill.

332
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,920
Are you sure he wasn't one of them?

333
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:58,484
I'm not repeating myself to you,
you prick.

334
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,928
If you're fucking with me, son,

335
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,805
I'll come back and do you worse
than those boys ever could.

336
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,200
- You got me?
- Got you.

337
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,888
On your way, son.

338
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,608
- So what class you in, John?
- 3A, mate.

339
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,085
3A'? Fucking hell, we got
a smart cunt here. Fuck's sake.

340
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:39,726
That cunt over there's got a blade.

341
00:29:39,841 --> 00:29:41,489
Who's it for?

342
00:29:41,602 --> 00:29:43,489
They're Cross lot, I think.

343
00:29:43,602 --> 00:29:45,850
The Krew and the Cross
have been at it all summer.

344
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,370
Fucking dodgy bastards, man.

345
00:29:54,802 --> 00:30:01,328
No, son. Not out here. Pick that up
and put it in the receptacle provided.

346
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:05,572
That's in the bucket, sir.
Past the sinks, up the back.

347
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:08,924
Thank you.

348
00:31:09,006 --> 00:31:12,095
Both of you, you're expelled!

349
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:15,131
Mr Muirhead. This is your last day
at school. You're expelled!

350
00:31:15,247 --> 00:31:19,929
Your name? You're expelled!
What's your name? You're expelled!

351
00:31:20,048 --> 00:31:21,695
- Every one of you.
- Sir! Sir!

352
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:25,332
Stay out this school! You're nothing
to do with this school any more!

353
00:31:25,447 --> 00:31:26,888
- Sir!
- What is it?

354
00:31:27,008 --> 00:31:30,009
- Whats so fucking important?
- Think I've been stabbed.

355
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,617
Right...

356
00:32:35,132 --> 00:32:38,176
Marcus...

357
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:41,973
... est. .

358
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:44,660
. . inn...

359
00:32:46,493 --> 00:32:48,261
... horto...

360
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:52,181
Anybody tell me
where you would find Marcus?

361
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:58,262
As usual I'll turn to the knowledgeable
Mr McGill to provide the answer.

362
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:00,338
Mr McGill'?

363
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:02,822
Mr McGill, are you with us?

364
00:33:02,934 --> 00:33:04,135
What?

365
00:33:04,254 --> 00:33:09,699
I said if a Roman said to you,
"Marcus est in horto, "

366
00:33:09,814 --> 00:33:11,582
where would you find Marcus?

367
00:33:15,854 --> 00:33:17,055
Who?

368
00:33:17,175 --> 00:33:20,743
Now, you see,
such is Mr McGill's modesty,

369
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:26,420
that he feigns ignorance in order
to avoid embarrassing you all.

370
00:33:26,535 --> 00:33:29,143
If a Roman said to you,

371
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:33,817
"Marcus est in horto, "

372
00:33:33,936 --> 00:33:36,576
where would you find Marcus?

373
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,020
Dunno.

374
00:33:40,135 --> 00:33:42,863
- I think you do.
- Just said I dunno.

375
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:47,024
Right.

376
00:33:47,136 --> 00:33:52,505
Well, you're obviously
all still in holiday mode,

377
00:33:52,616 --> 00:33:59,742
so I want you to turn to page 7A
in your textbooks,

378
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:03,579
and reacquaint yourselves
with basic first year Latin.

379
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,579
- Is anything the matter, John?
- Get your fucking hand off us, man.

380
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:23,667
What did you say to me?

381
00:34:23,778 --> 00:34:25,862
- Have you done this?
- No.

382
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:29,186
- I think you did.
- I didn't.

383
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:31,579
- You did this, didn't you?
- No.

384
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:35,620
Right, come on.
Stand up. Up you get.

385
00:34:37,059 --> 00:34:40,344
And come with me.
Come on. Down here.

386
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,461
You stand here. Stand here.

387
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,988
Now...

388
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,421
... in the 3 years I have been
at this school,

389
00:34:49,539 --> 00:34:51,427
this has never been used.

390
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:58,221
Now... l am prepared to overlook both
your belligerency and your vandalism,

391
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:03,261
if I am given first an admission
and, secondly, an apology.

392
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:07,706
Don't even know what you said.

393
00:35:08,901 --> 00:35:11,421
I find it difficult to believe
that in the space of 6 weeks,

394
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:14,302
you have suddenly
degenerated into idiocy.

395
00:35:15,861 --> 00:35:19,669
- So now I'm stupid?
- I don't have to take this.

396
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:22,346
So what you gonna do about it?

397
00:35:22,461 --> 00:35:25,550
I'll tell you what,
tell me to put my hands up,

398
00:35:25,662 --> 00:35:27,549
then lash me with that belt
like a real teacher.

399
00:35:27,662 --> 00:35:29,746
Right, you get your hands up.
Come on.

400
00:35:29,862 --> 00:35:33,943
Put them up, properly.
In front of you. Separately.

401
00:35:37,942 --> 00:35:40,791
There! Now, you get back
to your seat. Go on!

402
00:35:43,103 --> 00:35:45,788
- Is that it?
- What?

403
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:49,951
What, is that all you're gonna do?
If you're gonna do it, do it properly.

404
00:35:51,864 --> 00:35:56,872
I don't know...
what's got into you, McGill.

405
00:35:56,984 --> 00:36:00,825
But if I have to knock some sense
into you, then I bloody well will!

406
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:10,593
There, six. Now sit down!

407
00:36:13,425 --> 00:36:15,793
"Marcus is in the garden. "

408
00:36:15,905 --> 00:36:17,825
But Shh.

409
00:36:22,506 --> 00:36:26,434
Just what do you hope
to achieve by all this, McGill'?

410
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:28,473
Right!

411
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,348
Youse want a NED?

412
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:55,555
I'll give youse a fucking NED.

413
00:37:09,668 --> 00:37:11,829
What's happened to you, fuck's sake?

414
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:15,189
Someone's cashed
in their fucking Provy cheque.

415
00:37:16,389 --> 00:37:18,397
You paying us in, then?

416
00:39:57,278 --> 00:40:00,726
Krew ya bass! Come on! Fucking...

417
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:06,086
Fuck your Car-D!

418
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:19,043
Benny!

419
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:34,365
- John, where the fuck you going?
- You fucking daft cunt.

420
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,488
John!John!

421
00:41:26,603 --> 00:41:28,403
There he is.

422
00:41:38,324 --> 00:41:42,165
- He's got some fucking balls, man.
- Oi, wee man!

423
00:41:43,724 --> 00:41:45,808
Come over here a minute.

424
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,765
I just wanna talk to you, pal.

425
00:41:48,885 --> 00:41:52,245
Fucking get him! Car-D scum!

426
00:42:21,366 --> 00:42:23,570
This way. Go. Go.

427
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:27,571
What do you think you're doing,
barging in like that?

428
00:42:27,687 --> 00:42:29,728
- Those boys are gonna stab me.
- Who are you?

429
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:32,728
- Please, for just 5 minutes.
- I don't think so!

430
00:42:32,847 --> 00:42:34,855
Please. They're all gonna stab me.

431
00:42:34,967 --> 00:42:37,096
- I don't even know you from Adam!
- Please.

432
00:42:38,487 --> 00:42:40,288
Well, you'd better come on in.

433
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,576
You never get the police
when you want them.

434
00:42:46,008 --> 00:42:47,808
This used to be a good area.

435
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:52,936
Now you can't step over your front door
without worrying what these thugs are at.

436
00:42:53,048 --> 00:42:57,533
What sort of parents let their weans
roam the streets like a pack of wolves.

437
00:42:57,648 --> 00:42:59,972
Should all be locked up.

438
00:43:02,809 --> 00:43:06,257
Where have you been?
I've been worried sick.

439
00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:10,058
This young lad was nearly killed.
Where have you been?

440
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:14,370
- I was at my pals, you know where.
- I told you to be back by 9 o'clock.

441
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:17,578
I don't want you out
when there's lunatics running about.

442
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:22,255
- I'll walk him up the road, Ma.
- You will not. Stay right where you are.

443
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:25,895
I don't want you out there
with those eejits running about.

444
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,331
Er... l think it's all right to go now.

445
00:43:29,451 --> 00:43:32,692
- Are you sure, son?
- Aye, I should be safe.

446
00:43:33,531 --> 00:43:37,819
- Cheers for the tea and biscuits.
- Look after yourself. Be careful out there.

447
00:43:37,931 --> 00:43:39,851
Aye.

448
00:43:44,571 --> 00:43:47,016
All right, cheerio, son.

449
00:43:56,893 --> 00:43:59,937
- Fuck did youse lot get to?
- Did you not get Benny?

450
00:44:00,052 --> 00:44:03,293
- What?
- He went over there looking for you.

451
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:18,381
Fuck's he doing talking to that cunt?

452
00:44:18,493 --> 00:44:22,062
Put the tool down.
Put the fucking tool down.

453
00:44:25,374 --> 00:44:27,862
Fuck, man. You wee prick!

454
00:44:32,574 --> 00:44:35,618
Fucking Young Car-D!
Come on, you cunts! Come on!

455
00:44:52,976 --> 00:44:55,137
Fucking dafties!

456
00:45:02,016 --> 00:45:06,501
Should've stabbed that fucking Benny
when we had the chance.

457
00:45:37,178 --> 00:45:41,139
Look at the ginger cunt at the back!
He's got a disability!

458
00:45:42,178 --> 00:45:46,347
I'll fucking do you, fat prick.
Come on over here, you fat bastard.

459
00:45:46,459 --> 00:45:48,587
Bunch of bunnet rimmers,
look at youse!

460
00:45:50,179 --> 00:45:53,901
I've fucked your ma,
you fucking clown!

461
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:57,588
Your ma's had more bell-ends
than weekends.

462
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,220
What's that, Fifey, you fuck? What?

463
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,264
I'm getting into you!
What? You fucking prick.

464
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:11,465
- You fucking shitebag!
- Every fucking one of youse!

465
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,382
- Here, move out the way.
- Move the fuck away!

466
00:46:28,101 --> 00:46:31,506
It's not my fault it looks
like Wurzel Gummidge!

467
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:49,824
I Heaven,
I'm in heaven

468
00:46:49,943 --> 00:46:56,152
I And the cares that hung around me
through the week

469
00:46:56,263 --> 00:47:02,232
I Seem to vanish
like a gambler's lucky streak

470
00:47:02,343 --> 00:47:07,952
I When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek... I

471
00:47:20,064 --> 00:47:23,512
- Pull back!
- Fuck your Krew!

472
00:47:30,584 --> 00:47:31,752
Fucking cunt!

473
00:47:53,186 --> 00:47:54,791
Hey, youse...

474
00:47:54,906 --> 00:47:58,354
Come on. Put it down, man.
Get the fuck outta here.

475
00:48:14,787 --> 00:48:17,756
Go and play with that scooter
over there, Elaine.

476
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:20,072
You're in my roads.

477
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:04,191
- Can I help you?
- Want a newspaper delivered, Miss'??

478
00:49:04,310 --> 00:49:06,995
- No. No, thanks.
- Right, no bother.

479
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,599
Johnny, Claire wants you
to fill in her hole.

480
00:49:09,711 --> 00:49:13,072
- You'll need a bigger pen than that.
- Shut it or I'll kick you in the hole.

481
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:15,591
- Where are you from, sweetheart?
- Govan, why?

482
00:49:15,711 --> 00:49:17,872
Fuck, man.
Govan hairys in the house, boys.

483
00:49:17,991 --> 00:49:21,472
- Fucking hairy you, you arsehole.
- Who the fuck you calling a hairy?

484
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:24,799
Boy there says he's just moved in.
Wants to hang about with us.

485
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:28,152
- He's got a bit of blow and that.
- Fuck, man, tell him to bounce down.

486
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:31,993
Says he doesn't like to
in case John batters him.

487
00:49:32,112 --> 00:49:35,200
- Where is he?
- Over there.

488
00:49:36,753 --> 00:49:39,317
- Too right I'll fucking batter him.
- That's nasty.

489
00:49:39,432 --> 00:49:41,352
- What's he done to you?
- He dug me up.

490
00:49:41,472 --> 00:49:43,601
- Did you sort it?
- Benny did.

491
00:49:43,713 --> 00:49:45,480
Ah, Benny did!

492
00:49:45,593 --> 00:49:48,594
Bring him up here,
I'll kick his fucking head in.

493
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:50,557
- He's all right.
- Is he fuck, mate.

494
00:49:50,673 --> 00:49:52,397
You'll fucking what?

495
00:49:52,513 --> 00:49:55,482
- I'll kick his head in, mate.
- Kick whose fucking head in?

496
00:49:55,593 --> 00:49:58,921
I decide. If I fucking want him
up here, he's up here.

497
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:02,361
You'll need to go through me first then,
you fucking dick.

498
00:50:02,474 --> 00:50:04,798
No, mate. Me and you are mates.
it's him, mate.

499
00:50:07,114 --> 00:50:11,479
Just tell the cunt to come over.
it's all right. Just get him over.

500
00:50:17,275 --> 00:50:19,315
What made you move
from Hardridge, Canta?

501
00:50:19,434 --> 00:50:23,156
My ma wanted me to keep out of trouble
and not fall in with the bad crowd.

502
00:50:24,595 --> 00:50:27,236
- Bad crowd?
- Oh, aye.

503
00:50:30,795 --> 00:50:33,719
And this wee cunt's
got the giggles over here.

504
00:50:36,276 --> 00:50:40,564
Two snowmen in afield.
One turns to the other one and says,

505
00:50:40,676 --> 00:50:42,836
"Why do you smell of carrots?"

506
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:48,481
- The other one says, "l see coal. "
- Fucking knob-end.

507
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:57,886
John. Claire wants to know
if you want to go a walk?

508
00:50:57,997 --> 00:51:00,845
- If she wants.
- I'll go get her.

509
00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:32,964
You better not rip my tights.

510
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,965
- I'll be back in a minute.
- You better not leave me here.

511
00:51:45,080 --> 00:51:47,481
- I'll be back.
- I mean it.

512
00:51:53,201 --> 00:51:55,928
- Here, mate. Here.
- All right.

513
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,169
- Here.
- What is it?

514
00:52:00,601 --> 00:52:02,401
You remember what you done to me?

515
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:06,242
Honestly, John, I'm fucking sorry,
I swear to God. I didn't mean it.

516
00:52:06,361 --> 00:52:09,089
- Obviously I meant it, but...
- I remember what you done to me.

517
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:11,525
- Get your fucking hand down.
- It was years ago.

518
00:52:11,641 --> 00:52:14,446
We were both wee guys.
Just forget it.

519
00:52:14,562 --> 00:52:17,126
Doesn't matter how long ago.
You still did it.

520
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:19,642
I'm sorry. Just shake on it, man.
I'm really sorry.

521
00:52:19,762 --> 00:52:22,523
- I'm not shaking, but I'll let it go.
- Cool, mate.

522
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:25,763
Just remember I won't forget about it.
Understand?

523
00:52:25,882 --> 00:52:29,287
- You fucking idiot.
- What did youse fucking say there?

524
00:52:29,403 --> 00:52:31,847
- Never said anything. Honestly.
- Never said anything, did you?

525
00:52:31,962 --> 00:52:35,007
Didn't say anything, you fuck?

526
00:54:26,609 --> 00:54:28,497
And where have you been?

527
00:54:28,610 --> 00:54:31,250
Just round at a pal's house.

528
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,257
John, shut the door.

529
00:54:36,650 --> 00:54:40,414
See, from now on, I want you
up in that room every night.

530
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:41,938
Right?

531
00:54:46,490 --> 00:54:49,491
Your brother's been arrested.

532
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:51,018
What for?

533
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:53,892
Does it really matter what for?

534
00:54:56,571 --> 00:54:59,212
And in the morning...

535
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,421
He's up in front of the Sheriff.
I want you to go down there.

536
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:30,542
Come back,
tell me what happens.

537
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:33,098
I don't want the police
phoning next door.

538
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:37,261
And if any of the neighbours ask,
we had a break-in. Okay?

539
00:55:39,734 --> 00:55:41,698
And your Auntie Beth's coming tomorrow.

540
00:56:01,375 --> 00:56:04,179
Here to find out about my brother.

541
00:56:04,295 --> 00:56:07,777
- Does he have a name?
- Benjamin. Benjamin McGill.

542
00:56:07,896 --> 00:56:09,543
What time did he appear?

543
00:56:09,656 --> 00:56:11,664
Don't know.
The guy at the door wouldn't let me in.

544
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,143
- What guy?
- That police guy.

545
00:56:14,255 --> 00:56:16,296
You mean the police officer?

546
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:29,305
He appeared in front of the Sheriff
at 10:00. Bail's been set at £15.

547
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:32,385
If it's not paid by 4:00 this afternoon,
be taken out the back,

548
00:56:32,496 --> 00:56:35,137
placed in a van and
taken directly to Barlinnie Prison.

549
00:56:35,977 --> 00:56:38,738
- Now do you have £15'?
- No.

550
00:56:38,857 --> 00:56:41,422
Well, you better get it
before 4:00, eh?

551
00:56:44,177 --> 00:56:45,978
I'm here to pay my fine.

552
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:03,867
Ma. Benny needs £15 bail money.

553
00:57:03,979 --> 00:57:08,147
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- No, you're okay, thanks.

554
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:11,706
This is my son John.
He goes to school with your wee lad.

555
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,664
Would it be okay
if he popped in to see him?

556
00:57:13,779 --> 00:57:16,627
- Aye.
- Okay. Won't be a minute.

557
00:57:20,659 --> 00:57:24,424
You see that wee boy?
Someone out his throat in a gang fight.

558
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:28,022
- Now tell me, did your brother do this?
- Of course not, Ma.

559
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,025
I'm in a hurry. Gotta give us £15.
Gonna put Benny in jail.

560
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,829
- Maybe that's what he needs.
- What? He's not done anything.

561
00:57:35,941 --> 00:57:39,389
- Why did they arrest him, then?
- Dunno. You know what they're are like.

562
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:42,502
Minute a fight breaks out, they lift
anybody they can get their hands on.

563
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:45,622
- But Benny had nothing to do with it.
- No.

564
00:57:45,741 --> 00:57:48,109
- Come on, Ma...
- No, no.

565
00:57:48,221 --> 00:57:50,742
- I'm so sorry.
- What you sorry for?

566
00:57:50,861 --> 00:57:55,106
I need the bail money. Swear to god
Benny never touched that boy.

567
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:56,782
Who's Benny?

568
00:57:57,742 --> 00:57:59,826
Who's Benny?

569
00:57:59,942 --> 00:58:04,307
Do you know who did that to my boy?
Do you know who did that?

570
00:58:39,464 --> 00:58:41,984
Give me your fucking money
or I'll stab you.

571
00:59:00,345 --> 00:59:02,354
Where you going to, mate?

572
00:59:02,466 --> 00:59:05,106
Are you coming on the bus or no?

573
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:10,194
Don't even think about it.
Get off my bus! Get off my bus!

574
00:59:20,147 --> 00:59:23,355
I'll remember your face, wee man!
Bastard.

575
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:31,908
Benny, I've got the money.

576
00:59:32,027 --> 00:59:35,148
Well, go and pay it then,
you wee fanny!

577
00:59:35,987 --> 00:59:38,311
Oi! Somebody here to serve me?

578
00:59:38,428 --> 00:59:40,993
Who the fuck do you think
you're shouting at?

579
00:59:41,108 --> 00:59:43,672
Sorry. Just took my brother
into the wagon.

580
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,472
Unless you change your attitude,
you'll be joining him.

581
00:59:46,588 --> 00:59:48,508
Sorry. Can I pay the bill?

582
00:59:49,828 --> 00:59:52,512
- Name?
- John McGill.

583
00:59:54,949 --> 00:59:57,229
- There's no John McGill here.
- Benny McGill.

584
00:59:57,349 --> 00:59:58,997
Well, who's John McGill'?

585
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:01,313
I'm John McGill. I thought you were
asking for my name.

586
01:00:01,429 --> 01:00:03,753
£'I5.

587
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:06,597
To be deposited no later than 4:00pm.

588
01:00:07,709 --> 01:00:11,551
It's seven minutes past.
You're too late.

589
01:00:46,626 --> 01:00:49,791
- What's up?
- No, it's fine, man.

590
01:00:56,267 --> 01:00:57,871
Never mind him.

591
01:01:28,389 --> 01:01:31,717
There's a young boy upstairs.
He robbed my bus two weeks ago.

592
01:01:32,909 --> 01:01:35,877
Just watch it,
he held a knife blade to my throat.

593
01:02:16,792 --> 01:02:20,076
Now it's our favourite part of the night.
A wee sing-along.

594
01:02:20,192 --> 01:02:21,839
So, hit it, Sean.

595
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:23,916
Feel free to join in.

596
01:02:24,032 --> 01:02:27,916
I We've got the whole world
in our hands

597
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:30,793
I We've got the whole wide world
in our hands

598
01:02:30,912 --> 01:02:36,761
I We've got the whole world
in our hands

599
01:02:36,872 --> 01:02:39,916
I We've even got James

600
01:02:40,032 --> 01:02:45,521

601
01:02:45,633 --> 01:02:48,153

602
01:02:48,273 --> 01:02:50,641

603
01:02:50,753 --> 01:02:54,802
I... in our hands,
We've got Maria in our hands

604
01:02:54,914 --> 01:02:57,641

607
01:03:03,033 --> 01:03:06,481

608
01:03:06,595 --> 01:03:11,920
I We've got Jimmy in our hands

609
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:14,403
I We've got...

610
01:03:16,115 --> 01:03:18,996
- Come on.
- Your name, my friend?

611

I We've got John in our hands

613
01:03:30,036 --> 01:03:32,077
I We've got the whole world
in our hands I

614
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:47,920
Who put you up there?

615
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,481
Eh?

616
01:04:50,961 --> 01:04:53,209
You cheeky wee sod.

617
01:04:56,681 --> 01:04:58,645
Come on down.

618
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,848
Come on.

619
01:05:03,561 --> 01:05:06,049
We'll take all these shitebags.

620
01:05:08,201 --> 01:05:09,685
Come on.

621
01:05:15,442 --> 01:05:17,002
Shitebag.

622
01:05:21,642 --> 01:05:23,606
What the fuck, man?

623
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:36,731
What the fuck are you?

624
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:58,649
I You won't find another fool
like me, babe

625
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:06,570
I Who'll sit around all night
and wait for you

626
01:06:07,885 --> 01:06:14,488
I And close their eyes
to oh so many lies

627
01:06:14,606 --> 01:06:19,090
I No one else could love you
like I do...

628
01:06:21,805 --> 01:06:27,011
I You won't find another clown
like me, babe

629
01:06:27,126 --> 01:06:28,893
I No, you won't

630
01:06:29,006 --> 01:06:35,368
I I can't count the times
you said you'd leave...

631
01:07:05,328 --> 01:07:10,010
I... even though you treat me
like you do babe

632
01:07:10,129 --> 01:07:11,929
I You know you do

633
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:18,498
I I'm so hooked on you
I can't get free

634
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:22,493
I Oh, but I'll get
through the bad times

635
01:07:22,609 --> 01:07:25,937
I Cos in my heart I know

636
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:31,571
I That you won't find
another fool like me... I

637
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:47,291
Get up.

638
01:07:53,291 --> 01:07:54,895
Go home.

639
01:07:57,492 --> 01:07:59,500
Your mother's worried sick.

640
01:08:47,054 --> 01:08:50,656
- Youse here to see Mr Maloney'?
- Aye.

641
01:08:50,774 --> 01:08:53,775
- D'you wanna sit down, John?
- No, I'm all right.

642
01:08:57,895 --> 01:09:00,939
- What time's your appointment, son?
- My what?

643
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,456
What time are you due
to see the headmaster?

644
01:09:03,576 --> 01:09:06,183
I dunno.
My teacher just sent me here.

645
01:09:06,296 --> 01:09:07,703
Oh...

646
01:09:09,736 --> 01:09:12,256
So are you one of the favourites?

647
01:09:12,376 --> 01:09:15,901
Aye, must be.
She sends me here all the time.

648
01:09:16,016 --> 01:09:17,544
Good for you, son.

649
01:09:19,497 --> 01:09:21,417
Mrs McGill'?

650
01:09:24,257 --> 01:09:27,258
- Who sent you?
- Mrs Barry.

651
01:09:34,177 --> 01:09:35,618
Go.

652
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:45,147
- You sure you don't want a seat?
- I'm fine.

653
01:09:47,777 --> 01:09:50,178
Do you think I should
just knock and go in?

654
01:09:50,298 --> 01:09:51,662
I don't know.

655
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:57,583
No... I'd better not.
Don't wanna make your mum nervous.

656
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:02,307
You'll get back to your studies,

657
01:10:02,419 --> 01:10:05,268
and next time I'm over,
it'll be for your graduation.

658
01:10:20,060 --> 01:10:22,787
You two aren't in
Mrs Barry's class, are you?

659
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:24,383
Aye.

660
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,905
- What does this woman teach?
- Music.

661
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,428
Good God.

662
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,941
Thanks very much for your time.

663
01:10:36,021 --> 01:10:38,389
Your mother tells me
you've turned over a new leaf.

664
01:10:38,501 --> 01:10:39,985
Yes, sir.

665
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:45,503
We'll have you back, starting Monday.
On a probationary basis.

666
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:49,463
Any future disruption and you'll be
expelled indefinitely. Understand?

667
01:10:49,582 --> 01:10:50,946
Yes, sir.

668
01:10:56,621 --> 01:10:58,782
- Thank you.
- Thanks very much.

669
01:11:00,102 --> 01:11:02,623
- Who sent you?
- Mrs Barry.

670
01:11:13,263 --> 01:11:17,551
Fuck you doing? Get the light off
and get the door shut?

671
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:41,630
- How long you staying for?
- Not long. Be away again tomorrow.

672
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:45,149
- Where you going?
- Fucking off to London. Then Spain.

673
01:11:45,265 --> 01:11:48,550
- Spain?
- Aye, Spain.

674
01:11:48,665 --> 01:11:51,185
I need to get away
from everything, man.

675
01:11:54,466 --> 01:11:57,314
- Benny?
- What is it?

676
01:11:59,745 --> 01:12:01,666
You coming back?

677
01:12:05,026 --> 01:12:08,070
Look, wee man,
I'm going to sleep now, right?

678
01:13:45,672 --> 01:13:49,033
This is McGill.
Keep an eye on him.

679
01:13:49,152 --> 01:13:51,672
- This is his last chance.
- Aye.

680
01:14:01,512 --> 01:14:03,357
Take a seat.

681
01:14:12,994 --> 01:14:14,402
John!

682
01:14:15,594 --> 01:14:17,918
John? John!

683
01:14:19,274 --> 01:14:22,963
Are you in this class?
Fucking brilliant.

684
01:14:26,914 --> 01:14:29,359
Sir, what page are we on?

685
01:14:32,715 --> 01:14:34,482
Sir?

686
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:38,076
- You choose.
- He's fucking class.

687
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,645
- it's a beauty.
- Let's have a wee look.

688
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,888
Look at that.

689
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,408
Lovely, man.

690
01:16:08,761 --> 01:16:10,845
Hey, wee man. Wait there.

691
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:15,485
I want to fucking see you jump.

692
01:16:15,601 --> 01:16:18,962
Look, do you understand? Jump.

693
01:16:19,081 --> 01:16:20,641
Up and down.

694
01:16:20,761 --> 01:16:24,450
That's it. Do you want this fucking
through you? Do you?

695
01:16:24,561 --> 01:16:26,842
Well, fucking jump then.
I didn't say stop.

696
01:16:26,962 --> 01:16:29,046
That's a good boy. And again.

697
01:16:29,962 --> 01:16:31,566
And again.

698
01:16:31,681 --> 01:16:33,885
That's it, keep jumping
till I say stop.

699
01:16:34,002 --> 01:16:36,643
Going to fucking do it or what?
Put that between his fucking eyes.

700
01:16:36,762 --> 01:16:39,282
- You're doing my fucking nut in.
- I'll fucking do it.

701
01:16:39,402 --> 01:16:42,370
I'm doing it! Fuck!
Did I fucking say stop?

702
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:45,331
I've told you about that shop.
We need to fucking get there.

703
01:16:45,442 --> 01:16:47,963
- it's fucking shutting soon.
- I know when it fucking shuts.

704
01:16:54,163 --> 01:16:56,848
Nice one. Let's fucking go.
Let's get out of here.

705
01:16:56,963 --> 01:16:59,331
You're fucking dead next time.

706
01:17:15,204 --> 01:17:16,645
I'll go.

707
01:17:20,325 --> 01:17:24,973
it's Benjamin on the phone.
Okay, I'll be one second.

708
01:17:26,045 --> 01:17:30,486
That's Benjamin on the phone.
I'm just going to pop next door. Okay?

709
01:17:44,846 --> 01:17:46,406
Elizabeth...

710
01:17:48,486 --> 01:17:50,734
Cover your ears.

711
01:17:58,847 --> 01:18:01,051
Finish me.

712
01:19:26,652 --> 01:19:29,140
Come back when I'm asleep.

713
01:20:59,098 --> 01:21:01,422
- What the fuck?
- Fuck!

714
01:21:04,617 --> 01:21:07,345

715
01:21:08,498 --> 01:21:10,659
Hey, get the fuck away!

716
01:21:31,499 --> 01:21:33,867
Do you know what
you've let yourself in for?

717
01:21:33,979 --> 01:21:37,307
Think you can just fucking walk in here
and walk back out again?

718
01:21:40,620 --> 01:21:43,348
We'll fucking kill you!

719
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,741
Think you're fucking tough cos

720
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:50,904
Next time I see you,

721
01:21:51,020 --> 01:21:54,862
- You're fucking dead!

You're fucking dead, man!
He's in some state.

723
01:21:59,181 --> 01:22:02,466
Next time you come back without them.

724
01:22:07,581 --> 01:22:09,426
Kill me! DO it!

725

See what you done to Fifey,

734
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,553
Fuck you! Fuck you!

735

Fucking arsehole!

736
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,591

01:24:00,268 --> 01:24:02,277
- Get up.

We fucking backed you up.

742

You've completely fucking lost it,
mate.

743
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:24,271
- He's not right in the head.
- Cunt's fucking dangerous, man.

744
01:26:05,795 --> 01:26:08,796
That's not school-issue, McGill.

745
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:10,684
I'm confiscating that.

746
01:27:00,599 --> 01:27:03,087
What do youse think you're doing?

747
01:27:03,199 --> 01:27:05,447
Get back in the van!
There's lions round here!

748
01:27:05,559 --> 01:27:09,084
Calm down. I'm not gonna

751
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:25,129
- I've only got room for six. Hurry up.
- Should you not stay with the bus?

752
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:28,601
You stay with the bus,

753
01:27:30,081 --> 01:27:32,721
Right. McGill and Brown,

754
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:35,569
The rest of you,

755
01:28:50,605 --> 01:28:52,973
They're not coming back for us.

756
01:29:09,407 --> 01:29:10,531
Come on.
