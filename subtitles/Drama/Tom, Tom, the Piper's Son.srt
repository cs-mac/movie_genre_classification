1
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,553
The Jaturuungkabart

2
00:00:42,624 --> 00:00:45,525
Were sworn to protect
the mighty royal elephants.

3
00:00:45,599 --> 00:00:47,005
Why?

4
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:49,459
Elephants are so big.
Who could hurt them?

5
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:52,184
The king sits on top of them.

6
00:00:52,253 --> 00:00:54,707
So they must beware
of things from below.

7
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,666
Beware of what, Dad?

8
00:00:56,732 --> 00:01:01,465
If they lost their swords,
they would use their bodies as weapons.

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,173
Throw, crush, grab, and break.

10
00:01:05,242 --> 00:01:07,183
What do they need to be careful of?

11
00:01:07,257 --> 00:01:08,718
I cannot tell you yet.

12
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:12,883
But I'm going to be a Jatuuruungkabart.
I have to know.

13
00:01:14,423 --> 00:01:16,080
Not yet, Cam.

14
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:18,386
One day you will know.

15
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,171
Hello.

16
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:09,030
- Hello.
- Hello.

17
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:26,780
Splash him, son.
Splash him.

18
00:02:27,909 --> 00:02:29,370
Come on, splash him.
Splash him all over, son.

19
00:02:30,436 --> 00:02:31,580
Splash him, son.
Splash him.

20
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,829
How do you feel, Por Yai?

21
00:02:34,755 --> 00:02:36,510
Por Yai, you’re so naughty!.
Dad, look at him.

22
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,683
How was it?
Was Por Yai up to his old tricks again?

23
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:42,207
Why did Por Yai do that to you?

24
00:02:43,713 --> 00:02:46,363
Oh! Splash him, come on.

25
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:02,359
Dad. I'm here.

26
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:12,895
Father. Father. Father.
Where's Por Yai going?

27
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:16,361
Let him go, son.

28
00:05:34,294 --> 00:05:38,548
Pull... Pull... Pull it tight... Lasso it.

29
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:40,655
Come on, pull. Pull it.

30
00:07:14,429 --> 00:07:19,730
If I ever had the chance
to present Por Yai to the King...

31
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:25,746
...it would be biggest honor of my life.

32
00:07:26,106 --> 00:07:31,407
At the very least, it would mean that
I upheld the name of the Jatuuruungkabart.

33
00:07:57,842 --> 00:07:59,183
Kohrn...

34
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:02,764
I have something to show you.

35
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:04,649
Nice, nah?

36
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:18,376
I reckon this Songkran Water Festival
is going to be fun.

37
00:08:18,445 --> 00:08:21,062
Mr. Suthep is taking care of everything.

38
00:08:21,133 --> 00:08:23,139
He's throwing a huge party.

39
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,959
Well, his son's now a member
of government.

40
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:28,743
Hopefully, he can give us back
some of our profits.

41
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:32,487
Koi, I heard they are going to
check the elephants for royal status.

42
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:34,528
Aren't you going to take your elephants,

43
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,640
to see if they're in with a chance?

44
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:47,131
Say goodbye to Por Yai, Cam.

45
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,316
After Por Yai has been checked...

46
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:54,493
...We might not have the chance
to see him again.

47
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,976
This could be
a great opportunity for you.

48
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,118
There's no reason to worry.

49
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:26,134
Annual Songkran Water Festival

50
00:09:28,156 --> 00:09:29,203
Mr. Koi,

51
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:30,584
...this way, please.

52
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,631
Hello.

53
00:09:31,707 --> 00:09:32,819
Welcome.

54
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,544
Dad. They're here.

55
00:09:37,081 --> 00:09:37,942
Hello, Mr. Koi.

56
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:39,666
- Please, come inside.
- Yes, sir.

57
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:41,296
Everything's ready.

58
00:09:41,368 --> 00:09:42,349
Come in.

59
00:09:42,424 --> 00:09:43,372
Go on, Kohrn.

60
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,040
Wait outside for awhile.

61
00:09:45,111 --> 00:09:47,925
Your father should go in alone.

62
00:09:53,782 --> 00:09:56,432
This is Supoj, a friend of mine.

63
00:09:56,501 --> 00:09:57,842
Hello, sir.

64
00:09:57,908 --> 00:10:00,012
He takes care of this place.

65
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:02,352
He will take care of everything for you.

66
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,735
Young man, would you like a bell
for your elephant?

67
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,077
Do you want a bell?

68
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,347
Do you want one?

69
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,824
It's for good luck.

70
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,322
Do you want one
for your elephant?

71
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:21,097
How much is this one?

72
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,659
That one is 40 Baht.

73
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,291
It's not expensive.

74
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:26,535
Buy a bell for your elephant
and get good luck.

75
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,131
Thank you, sir.

76
00:10:32,972 --> 00:10:33,920
Let me take a look.

77
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,805
That's lovely.

78
00:10:39,434 --> 00:10:40,677
Let's go.

79
00:10:55,398 --> 00:10:58,658
BLIND BOXING

80
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,292
Thank you.

81
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:56,243
Come on.

82
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:58,218
Bring it here.

83
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:00,075
Wait! Wait!

84
00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:01,457
Are you taking him away today?

85
00:12:02,036 --> 00:12:03,464
Yes, today.

86
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:05,296
You can go back home and wait there.

87
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:06,312
I will let you know what happens later.

88
00:12:06,387 --> 00:12:07,335
But...

89
00:12:07,411 --> 00:12:08,654
Come on. Quickly.

90
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:15,311
Move it.

91
00:12:16,274 --> 00:12:17,550
Come on.

92
00:12:18,385 --> 00:12:19,628
Quickly.

93
00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:21,383
Come on... Come on...

94
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,363
You can't take him.
Not yet.

95
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:25,379
I won't let you.

96
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,883
You can't.

97
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,510
You can't. You can't take him.

98
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,970
I said you can't take him.

99
00:12:32,045 --> 00:12:33,059
Force it to go.

100
00:12:33,133 --> 00:12:34,441
I said you can't take him.

101
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:36,483
You old fart.
I told you.

102
00:13:02,278 --> 00:13:03,651
Move it. Quickly.

103
00:13:58,648 --> 00:13:59,792
Look! Elephants.

104
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:09,481
Didn't you see the truck?

105
00:14:14,643 --> 00:14:15,722
Father...

106
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:18,091
Father...

107
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:19,820
What happened, Father?

108
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,580
- Father...
- Cam.

109
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,045
Check on Por Yai.

110
00:15:07,367 --> 00:15:08,708
Move it.

111
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:10,780
I said move!

112
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:46,393
Oracle Ceremony - To Find Por Yai

113
00:17:41,824 --> 00:17:43,732
Baby. We belong together

114
00:17:43,807 --> 00:17:46,457
enjoying the forest with a joyful heart.

115
00:17:46,974 --> 00:17:48,828
The waterfall pours down

116
00:17:48,894 --> 00:17:51,511
as if heaven was before our eyes.

117
00:17:51,581 --> 00:17:56,849
Birds coo like my loving words for you.

118
00:18:22,837 --> 00:18:24,330
Who the hell are you?

119
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,572
Do you want my foot in your mouth?

120
00:18:36,722 --> 00:18:38,576
Go on.
Get him.

121
00:18:55,725 --> 00:18:57,382
Go get him.

122
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,607
My teeth!

123
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:17,378
Wait for me.

124
00:19:26,246 --> 00:19:27,968
Where are Por Yai and Kohrn?

125
00:19:28,965 --> 00:19:30,241
- Where are they?
- I don't know.

126
00:19:30,308 --> 00:19:31,322
I don't know.

127
00:19:31,396 --> 00:19:32,377
You don't know? You don't know?

128
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:33,433
Johnny.

129
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:35,101
Johnny took them.

130
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,537
They're in Sydney.

131
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,470
Where is he?

132
00:19:42,785 --> 00:19:43,995
Father!

133
00:19:44,065 --> 00:19:45,624
Shoot! Shoot him!

134
00:19:55,518 --> 00:19:57,077
Enough.

135
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,840
You’re hurting me.

136
00:20:00,893 --> 00:20:02,201
Come on. Quickly.

137
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:05,936
Move it.

138
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,478
Sydney 2 Weeks Later

139
00:22:00,543 --> 00:22:05,462
While the NGO were gathering to protest
the transfer of Thai elephant to Sydney.

140
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:09,394
there’s a report
that the elephant was stolen.

141
00:22:09,468 --> 00:22:12,118
and Mr. Wittaya Thammarrat.

142
00:22:12,188 --> 00:22:15,765
the owner of the well-known
Thai restaurant Tom Yuum Goong Atop

143
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,175
has been killed.

144
00:22:17,242 --> 00:22:20,623
The motive of murder
was believed that Wittaya was involved

145
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:24,559
with the Chinese mafia gang
and many illegal activities

146
00:22:24,632 --> 00:22:27,827
that can leads to business conflicts
with them.

147
00:22:27,896 --> 00:22:29,586
For the missing elephant.

148
00:22:29,656 --> 00:22:33,397
there is no report or confirmation
from the authorities at the moment

149
00:22:33,462 --> 00:22:35,370
if this connects to the murder case.

150
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:36,787
...belongs in Thailand.

151
00:22:36,853 --> 00:22:39,470
The best way
to enrich this elephant’s environment

152
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:41,329
is to put it with other elephants.

153
00:22:41,396 --> 00:22:45,039
so that he can live with his family.
in its home.

154
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:48,881
We don't want the elephant in Australia.
The elephant belongs in Thailand.

155
00:22:48,947 --> 00:22:51,979
Yeah!
Send him home!

156
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:57,099
Reporters have asked the Thai consulate
for more information about the incident.

157
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,298
We are very sorry for the incident
that happened today.

158
00:23:00,368 --> 00:23:04,295
We also would like to inform you
that Thailand do have a very strict law

159
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,854
for the protection and conservation
of elephants.

160
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:12,456
At first. We thought that the...
giving of elephants to the zoo

161
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:14,629
is done by donation for public use.

162
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,408
We later found out that there’s
criminal activities behind the scene.

163
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:25,766
And this is the main Asian market
in downtown Sydney.

164
00:23:25,834 --> 00:23:28,899
Most of the people here
are Asian, you know?

165
00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:31,423
Chinese, Thai, Vietnam.

166
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:34,660
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
And Laos.

167
00:23:35,335 --> 00:23:38,530
So officer here
need to understand Asians way.

168
00:23:38,598 --> 00:23:40,801
Like me, for instance.

169
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,876
This how I do my job.

170
00:23:42,949 --> 00:23:45,795
It's important to stay in touch
with the people.

171
00:23:49,443 --> 00:23:50,457
What beautiful mangoes.

172
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:51,992
Hello. How are you?

173
00:23:52,066 --> 00:23:53,472
They look lovely.

174
00:23:54,658 --> 00:23:55,606
How much?

175
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:57,852
Do you want some?
Take some.

176
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,665
Take them. It's no problem.

177
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,808
- How much?
- Forget it.

178
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,406
- Are you sure?
- Just take them.

179
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,756
Well, okay, then. Can I take two more?

180
00:24:05,823 --> 00:24:07,316
Take them. Go on.

181
00:24:07,391 --> 00:24:09,146
- Thank you very much.
- Not at all.

182
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:12,061
This just the way
we do things here.

183
00:24:12,125 --> 00:24:15,320
Asian in the foreign place
needs to stick together.

184
00:24:15,389 --> 00:24:16,533
Like firemen.

185
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,667
...I'll be there to chase.

186
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:22,040
Why? Do you miss me?

187
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:24,790
Whoa, Wwwwhoa, Wwwwhoa, Wwwwhoa,
Wwwwhoa, Wwwwhoa, Wwwwhoa.

188
00:24:24,858 --> 00:24:26,450
Take it easy, baby.

189
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:30,034
I kiss you. I kiss you first.
Okay?

190
00:24:32,824 --> 00:24:34,034
I love you.

191
00:24:34,104 --> 00:24:35,216
Bye.

192
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,187
Hey! Just in time.

193
00:24:42,262 --> 00:24:44,814
This is my new partner Rick.

194
00:24:44,886 --> 00:24:47,405
He's a young
aristocratic kind of bloke.

195
00:24:47,476 --> 00:24:49,330
A little less hard-working than I am.

196
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:51,304
Hey!
Lighten up, mate!

197
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,288
Let's not work right now.

198
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:57,617
Using public services
is part of our job as police officer.

199
00:24:57,682 --> 00:24:59,983
You know?
To serve and protect.

200
00:25:01,202 --> 00:25:02,510
You look like you're constipated
or something.

201
00:25:02,577 --> 00:25:05,642
Sergeant Mark. there's a robbery
at mini-mart on Thurwood Street.

202
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,676
Why you call police?

203
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:18,178
What am I supposed to do?

204
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:33,636
Apparently, the robber is a teenager.

205
00:25:33,705 --> 00:25:37,249
Only the shop owner and his wife
are in the shop.

206
00:25:37,768 --> 00:25:39,807
All right, listen up!

207
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,188
I want you to drop your weapon...

208
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:43,164
Nick, Nick, Nick.
No, no, no, no.

209
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:44,962
Leave him to me.

210
00:25:55,492 --> 00:25:58,076
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.

211
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:01,561
Take it easy, mister.
Okay? Okay?

212
00:26:02,626 --> 00:26:03,770
Hey, Tuui.

213
00:26:03,842 --> 00:26:05,150
You stupid prick.

214
00:26:05,217 --> 00:26:06,460
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

215
00:26:06,529 --> 00:26:07,837
How did you know, Sarge?

216
00:26:07,904 --> 00:26:10,008
You idiot. With a face like that,
who wouldn't be able to spot you?

217
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,966
Put the damn gun down.
Put it down!

218
00:26:12,031 --> 00:26:12,979
Stay away.

219
00:26:13,055 --> 00:26:14,134
If you come any closer, I'll shoot.

220
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:17,718
Shoot me if you want,
but don't forget your mother.

221
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:20,025
When she gets here,
you're in deep shit.

222
00:26:20,094 --> 00:26:21,719
Don't lie to me.

223
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,770
My mom isn't here.

224
00:26:22,844 --> 00:26:24,534
She is. Look behind you!

225
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:38,031
Come on. Imbecile.

226
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:39,827
Look. They caught the guy.

227
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:41,522
He's so brave.

228
00:26:41,592 --> 00:26:43,184
It's been just another day.

229
00:26:43,255 --> 00:26:45,709
Anyway, enough fun for now, okay?

230
00:26:45,783 --> 00:26:46,731
Bye.

231
00:26:49,846 --> 00:26:51,950
Excuse me, Mark.
Mark, can I have another question, please?

232
00:27:12,241 --> 00:27:13,734
Go on, run.

233
00:27:13,808 --> 00:27:14,789
Don't be such a wimp.

234
00:27:14,864 --> 00:27:16,041
You idiot.

235
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,230
How could you do that, Sarge?

236
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:21,250
It's against procedure.

237
00:27:21,326 --> 00:27:23,300
It's no use arresting young junkie mind.

238
00:27:23,374 --> 00:27:24,355
Yeah, but we should go by the rules.

239
00:27:24,429 --> 00:27:25,322
Put a sock in it!

240
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,205
Don't you know?

241
00:27:27,277 --> 00:27:31,912
Just forget it.
You idiot! Go! Go! Go!

242
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,190
Let's go!

243
00:27:35,147 --> 00:27:36,553
Shit! When did that happen?

244
00:27:37,098 --> 00:27:38,853
Why didn't anyone tell me?

245
00:27:50,215 --> 00:27:51,807
Why aren't you working?!

246
00:27:53,062 --> 00:27:56,061
Why in the hell
do you think your boyfriend's dead, huh?

247
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,522
Remember him?

248
00:27:58,597 --> 00:27:59,709
Or do you wanna die like him?

249
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,153
I know I can pay.

250
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,877
You know you can pay?!

251
00:28:02,948 --> 00:28:06,045
How in hell are you gonna pay?!
Huh?!

252
00:28:06,115 --> 00:28:08,503
Thai student only allowed two jobs here.

253
00:28:08,578 --> 00:28:12,854
One, you can be a waitress,
or you can be a call girl.

254
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,262
What can you do?! Huh?!

255
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,966
You got two weeks.
That's it!

256
00:28:24,734 --> 00:28:26,489
News from Thailand.

257
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,419
Thai have expressed a concern
about the boycott from NGOs.

258
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:36,692
If the NGOs truly understood
the elephant situation here,

259
00:28:36,763 --> 00:28:37,940
then they wouldn't be against us.

260
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,739
From all the exits to the meeting room,

261
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:45,526
guards have been placed
at every 10 meters.

262
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:48,941
Uncle, I have
arranged everything for you.

263
00:28:49,016 --> 00:28:51,666
I've hired Sydney's top chef
to make abalone soup.

264
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:53,361
I made it for all of you.

265
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,056
I hope everyone will enjoy it.
Especially you, Uncle.

266
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:58,928
You should have more of it.
This is good for your health.

267
00:28:59,926 --> 00:29:03,536
It will keep you strong.
With good health,

268
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:06,157
you’ll be able to look after
the family business forever.

269
00:29:16,785 --> 00:29:18,639
Are you sure this is abalone?

270
00:29:19,313 --> 00:29:21,319
It's bland, there's no aroma
and no sweetness.

271
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,748
It tastes like earthworms.

272
00:29:25,071 --> 00:29:27,819
You know earthworms, right?

273
00:29:28,302 --> 00:29:33,189
Slithering insects
which have 2 genders...

274
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:34,886
without being either.

275
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,986
So what about it, Rose?

276
00:29:39,051 --> 00:29:41,057
If you can't even
provide proper food for me,

277
00:29:41,131 --> 00:29:43,334
how do you expect to protect me?

278
00:29:45,354 --> 00:29:48,255
For security,
it's better to let Cheng handle it.

279
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:50,174
I think this is better.

280
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:55,492
When your father was alive,
Cheng Was in charge.

281
00:29:57,926 --> 00:30:01,307
What you do shows
no respect to our clients.

282
00:30:03,045 --> 00:30:07,037
We are negotiating
with representatives of the government.

283
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:11,647
If we unite with them,
our business will grow rapidly.

284
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:16,191
Concentrate on the restaurant
I gave you.

285
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,600
That's enough responsibility
for you, Rose.

286
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,333
That stupid old man made me lose face
in front of everyone.

287
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:36,668
You don't need to be angry or impatient.

288
00:30:38,973 --> 00:30:42,517
You already have this, don't you?

289
00:30:48,378 --> 00:30:51,693
I think this new fate of mine
will finally rid me of that old man.

290
00:31:39,086 --> 00:31:40,263
Sorry. Sorry.

291
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,801
Hey, g'day, mate.

292
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,809
Where's a pretty boy like you from?

293
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:58,466
Next question.
Where We go...

294
00:31:58,537 --> 00:32:01,405
Oh, here, is it?
Okay, right ahead.

295
00:32:08,102 --> 00:32:10,435
Tom Yuum Goong.
Yeah, I know this place.

296
00:32:10,502 --> 00:32:11,745
Great food.
Beautiful girls, too.

297
00:32:11,813 --> 00:32:12,892
You like girls?

298
00:32:12,965 --> 00:32:15,964
Tell me something, did you
get in this country legally or illegally?

299
00:32:16,036 --> 00:32:18,904
You know the big gates...
Have you got a passport?

300
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:30,710
Change of plan.

301
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:32,027
Hang on!

302
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,100
Come on!

303
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:48,982
Look at them!
They're good for nothing! Nothing!

304
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,165
Mark. We found Jimmy
heading to Thai town.

305
00:32:58,234 --> 00:32:59,695
Requesting back-up immediately.

306
00:33:00,953 --> 00:33:01,901
I'm on it.

307
00:33:08,312 --> 00:33:09,773
A tricycle is faster than this.

308
00:33:09,847 --> 00:33:10,610
Stop here!

309
00:33:16,277 --> 00:33:18,665
- Is that the best you can do?
- I'm trying!

310
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:20,424
God, you drive like a pensioner.

311
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:51,905
Shit! Come on.
Come on, boy!

312
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,248
Come on!
Get out of the car!

313
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:56,322
Get out of the car now!
Come on.

314
00:33:56,395 --> 00:33:57,801
Keep away from me!

315
00:33:57,866 --> 00:34:00,167
You come any closer, he's dead.
You hear me?

316
00:34:00,234 --> 00:34:01,182
Keep away from me!

317
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:04,671
Hey! Jimmy! Calm down.
Calm down, calm down.

318
00:34:04,745 --> 00:34:06,086
Let's talk, okay?

319
00:34:06,152 --> 00:34:08,387
I don't wanna talk!
Just get away!

320
00:34:08,456 --> 00:34:09,732
You! Hey! Hey!

321
00:34:09,799 --> 00:34:11,521
Can't you hear me?
Piss off!

322
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,011
You want me to shoot him?
I'll shoot the little bastard!

323
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:15,034
Hey, hey, hey!

324
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:16,320
- I'm gonna count to three.
- Stop!

325
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,731
One! One... piss off!

326
00:34:17,798 --> 00:34:19,869
Do you want me to shoot him,
you wanker?

327
00:34:19,941 --> 00:34:23,900
Hey! I'll shoot him!
Piss off! Eh!

328
00:34:23,972 --> 00:34:27,353
Okay, okay!
Uncle! I give up!

329
00:34:36,673 --> 00:34:38,046
What the hell you doing?

330
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:40,150
He was a hostage.

331
00:34:40,224 --> 00:34:41,303
No. He wasn't.

332
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:43,000
Now go get him.

333
00:34:44,927 --> 00:34:46,519
I said go get him.

334
00:35:23,093 --> 00:35:24,369
I didn't do anything wrong.

335
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:31,115
I will handle this.

336
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:43,911
Vincent didn't have to shoot him.

337
00:35:43,984 --> 00:35:45,543
Don't you think he went a bit too far?

338
00:35:45,615 --> 00:35:48,778
Jimmy was no ordinary thief.
I know him well.

339
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:52,169
And this guy was not with him.

340
00:35:52,238 --> 00:35:54,790
- How do you know?
- I don't.

341
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,747
I just have a hunch.

342
00:35:59,628 --> 00:36:01,536
What are you doing here?

343
00:36:01,612 --> 00:36:03,782
Oh! Are you Thai?

344
00:36:03,851 --> 00:36:07,014
I'm speaking Thai.
Do you think I'm Burmese?

345
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,870
Did you come to Sydney
to break the law?

346
00:36:08,938 --> 00:36:09,886
No, sir.

347
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:11,651
I've come here to find Por Yai
and my little brother.

348
00:36:11,721 --> 00:36:13,378
- You’re looking for your relatives?
- Yes, sir.

349
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,453
- What do they look like?
- Like elephants.

350
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,013
Elephants?

351
00:36:18,983 --> 00:36:20,226
Elephants?

352
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:22,715
Who's like an elephant in Thai town?

353
00:36:23,334 --> 00:36:25,056
Come on. Let's talk about this
back at my office.

354
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,489
Mark!

355
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:33,690
Hello.

356
00:36:33,763 --> 00:36:35,453
How's it going, Goong?

357
00:36:35,523 --> 00:36:37,431
- Are your clients keeping you busy?
- Not really.

358
00:36:37,506 --> 00:36:39,774
It's your fault.
You never visit my restaurant.

359
00:36:39,842 --> 00:36:40,954
I'm really busy.

360
00:36:41,025 --> 00:36:42,747
- There's a new promotion on.
- Yeah?

361
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,409
Special price at lunchtime.

362
00:36:44,481 --> 00:36:45,887
- I'll go if I have time.
- Okay.

363
00:36:48,288 --> 00:36:50,229
It's a Thai restaurant.

364
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,375
Tom Yuum Goong is Thai food.

365
00:36:52,446 --> 00:36:54,038
So why did they hire
a Vietnamese guy like Johnny

366
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:55,222
to be the general manager?

367
00:36:55,294 --> 00:36:57,813
- It's Johnny! Johnny!
- Shut up!

368
00:36:59,581 --> 00:37:00,693
Okay. See you later.

369
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:01,713
See you.

370
00:37:01,788 --> 00:37:03,064
- Work hard.
- You, too.

371
00:37:03,132 --> 00:37:05,203
Follow them quickly.
Hurry up!

372
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:06,583
I said shut up! Be quiet!

373
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,722
- Don't start any trouble.
- Follow that car quickly!

374
00:37:08,795 --> 00:37:10,583
Quiet down! Quiet down!

375
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:15,603
Those are the people
that took Por Yai and Kohrn.

376
00:37:15,673 --> 00:37:17,232
Don't say that.

377
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:19,026
You can't accuse someone
without any evidence.

378
00:37:19,096 --> 00:37:20,982
I have a photo, but it's in the taxi.

379
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:22,868
Don't waste my time.
We'll talk at the station.

380
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:25,710
Hey!

381
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:28,021
Let him go.

382
00:37:31,829 --> 00:37:32,843
Hey! Hey!

383
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,648
Stop!

384
00:37:36,724 --> 00:37:39,025
Or I'll shoot!

385
00:37:53,744 --> 00:37:55,336
I've come to see the secretary.

386
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:59,171
- Sure you wanna...
- Johnny!

387
00:37:59,566 --> 00:38:00,842
Where are my elephants?

388
00:38:02,669 --> 00:38:03,596
Where are my elephants?

389
00:38:04,589 --> 00:38:06,115
He asking for his elephant.

390
00:38:06,189 --> 00:38:07,170
Johnny!

391
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:26,341
Johnny!
Give me back my elephants.

392
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:34,650
We are both Thais. So I'll warn you.

393
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:36,252
Don't get involved with them.

394
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:16,056
This is top quality.

395
00:39:31,447 --> 00:39:32,591
Kill him.

396
00:39:46,067 --> 00:39:47,343
Shit!

397
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,784
You think this is a game?

398
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:50,093
What are you doing?

399
00:39:50,962 --> 00:39:52,205
James.

400
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:53,701
James!

401
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,108
Make sure he's dead.

402
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,963
The Thai government says it is trying to
resolve the issue of elephants

403
00:45:47,032 --> 00:45:49,202
wandering around on Bangkok Streets.

404
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:53,231
ordering recreation of the pachyderms
out of the capital.

405
00:45:55,126 --> 00:45:56,816
What should I do with the two of you?

406
00:45:57,270 --> 00:46:01,425
You lost a suspect and managed to
cause all that ruckus on the road.

407
00:46:02,581 --> 00:46:04,555
I'm taking you both off the case.

408
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,569
It's being assigned to someone else.

409
00:46:06,644 --> 00:46:09,545
As of now, the two of you
can help Inspector Vincent

410
00:46:09,619 --> 00:46:12,487
With security for the Secretary-General's
meeting With Mr. Sim.

411
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,286
Aren't you being slightly...

412
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:16,295
I'm not arguing with you.

413
00:46:16,370 --> 00:46:18,857
I paired you up with Mark
hoping you'd be able to keep him in line.

414
00:46:18,929 --> 00:46:21,067
I didn't expect you
to start acting like him.

415
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,294
We've had a report from area 3.

416
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:26,155
About drugs in an Asian shoot-out.

417
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:28,844
Everyone's fled the scene.

418
00:46:30,126 --> 00:46:32,012
There's evidence
that needs to be collected.

419
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37,281
I don't understand
Why that area's so buggered up.

420
00:46:37,356 --> 00:46:40,355
The area that you, Mark,
are so proud to protect.

421
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:49,479
Where is Jimmy's body?

422
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:53,535
Whoa.

423
00:46:55,112 --> 00:46:56,867
And the evidence?

424
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,511
Look. Don't take anything.

425
00:47:04,901 --> 00:47:06,144
I know.

426
00:47:08,484 --> 00:47:10,785
You’re an ugly son of a bitch.

427
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:17,856
Okay, thanks.

428
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:21,114
A Thai man with a red scarf.

429
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,981
- What did we lose?
- A lot.

430
00:47:27,935 --> 00:47:30,236
We’ve also lost our dealer..

431
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:34,044
Who will want to do business with us
after this mess?

432
00:47:35,965 --> 00:47:37,491
Get the hell out of here.

433
00:47:38,429 --> 00:47:40,762
- Do you want me to...
- Just get out.

434
00:47:50,426 --> 00:47:51,669
All right.

435
00:47:53,657 --> 00:47:55,150
I got it.

436
00:47:56,089 --> 00:47:57,233
I know.

437
00:47:57,304 --> 00:47:58,961
I will leave now!

438
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:29,669
Kings sit upon the elephants.

439
00:48:34,798 --> 00:48:36,968
Vital areas are underneath.

440
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,604
Enemies aim for those areas.

441
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:49,157
Soldiers protect the 4 most vital areas
of the elephants.

442
00:49:00,891 --> 00:49:04,060
One day you will know, Cam.

443
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:36,041
At the scene of the crime
police have found a passport

444
00:49:36,042 --> 00:49:40,027
belonging to the suspect, who
the authorities believe he was involved

445
00:49:40,027 --> 00:49:43,451
in the drug deal
at warehouse inn King Cross area.

446
00:49:43,656 --> 00:49:46,229
The suspect was seen
wearing a red scarf.

447
00:49:46,229 --> 00:49:51,352
If anyone has seen this man.
Please contact the police immediately.

448
00:50:58,077 --> 00:50:58,699
Yes, yes.

449
00:50:58,699 --> 00:51:01,257
All right, okay.
Let me get back to you on that.

450
00:51:01,788 --> 00:51:03,023
Right. Thank you.

451
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:12,799
To our success!

452
00:51:13,990 --> 00:51:15,635
All right!

453
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:38,658
My... my medicine.

454
00:52:40,588 --> 00:52:41,797
Go! Go!

455
00:52:57,581 --> 00:52:58,595
What are you doing?

456
00:53:16,751 --> 00:53:17,896
Tui.

457
00:53:18,415 --> 00:53:19,821
What the hell are you doing?

458
00:53:19,887 --> 00:53:22,538
He forced me to do it, Sarge. I...

459
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,273
What? What the hell...

460
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:42,128
Rick!

461
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:47,986
What's up, senior constable?

462
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:49,993
You’re not familiar
with your new gun?

463
00:53:50,067 --> 00:53:50,994
Take him.

464
00:53:51,988 --> 00:53:55,217
He and this Thai boy
killed the Secretary-General.

465
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:11,532
Bring him back!

466
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:27,948
Over there.

467
00:54:28,023 --> 00:54:29,779
You, go with him.
Come on.

468
00:54:29,848 --> 00:54:30,830
Go right here.

469
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:33,869
Boss, he's gone.

470
00:54:37,752 --> 00:54:40,272
We searched around.
One girl is missing.

471
00:54:40,345 --> 00:54:41,294
Find her.

472
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:50,071
It disgusting.
People who buy pirated DVDs!

473
00:54:50,139 --> 00:54:51,665
Don't do it again.

474
00:54:57,531 --> 00:55:01,460
The assassination of the
Secretary-General of the police bureau

475
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:03,158
has shocked the city.

476
00:55:03,229 --> 00:55:05,749
Police are now tracking down
Senior Sergeant Mark,

477
00:55:05,821 --> 00:55:08,406
who is well-known in China town.

478
00:55:08,477 --> 00:55:11,793
The coroner's reports indicate
that the fingerprints on the gun

479
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:13,940
belong to Senior Sergeant Mark.

480
00:55:14,013 --> 00:55:17,625
Police assume that the motive
behind the killing

481
00:55:17,694 --> 00:55:19,516
was a trade dispute.

482
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:23,860
Meanwhile, the Asia Channel
has recently broadcast a secret tape

483
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:27,448
that Senior Sergeant Mark
illegally released the Thai convict.

484
00:55:46,912 --> 00:55:48,057
- Hello.
- Mark.

485
00:55:48,129 --> 00:55:49,557
This is Goong.

486
00:55:49,633 --> 00:55:51,291
Where are you?

487
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,248
I just watched the news,
and I'm worried about you.

488
00:55:54,849 --> 00:55:56,093
Don't say anything.

489
00:55:56,161 --> 00:55:58,048
Someone might be listening.

490
00:55:58,114 --> 00:55:59,641
Can we meet?

491
00:55:59,714 --> 00:56:01,754
Plas just called me.

492
00:56:01,827 --> 00:56:04,544
She has evidence which can prove
that you’re innocent.

493
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:07,295
She won't see me unless I see you first.

494
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,469
No problem. Where?

495
00:56:20,005 --> 00:56:21,378
Mark?

496
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:23,070
I'm sorry.

497
00:56:34,823 --> 00:56:35,772
You!

498
00:57:26,124 --> 00:57:27,269
Where's the camera?

499
00:57:27,853 --> 00:57:30,471
No! Let me go!
Let me go!

500
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:33,444
I don't know, I don't know!
I don't know anything!

501
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:35,406
Please! Let me go!

502
00:57:43,631 --> 00:57:46,151
Ever since Johnny came here...

503
00:57:46,384 --> 00:57:48,717
it has been hell for everyone.

504
00:57:50,256 --> 00:57:53,638
Everyone from the waitresses
to the manager.

505
00:57:57,809 --> 00:57:59,631
I don't know what to do.

506
00:57:59,697 --> 00:58:03,440
They built a secret entrance
at the back of the restaurant...

507
00:58:03,505 --> 00:58:06,025
for their VIP clients.

508
00:58:06,098 --> 00:58:07,440
Everyone wants to know...

509
00:58:07,505 --> 00:58:09,677
what goes on up there.

510
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:16,265
Hey! No! Please!
I'm sorry! No!

511
00:58:22,645 --> 00:58:26,419
Maybe the relative you are looking for
is up there.

512
00:58:37,717 --> 00:58:39,244
Where's Johnny?

513
00:59:15,866 --> 00:59:16,880
Hey!

514
00:59:25,115 --> 00:59:26,063
Hey, you!

515
01:03:00,278 --> 01:03:01,838
Where are my elephants?

516
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,375
Where are my elephants?

517
01:03:16,823 --> 01:03:18,765
What's he saying?

518
01:03:18,839 --> 01:03:20,398
Where are my elephants?

519
01:03:25,848 --> 01:03:28,019
What you looking for? Huuh?

520
01:03:31,801 --> 01:03:33,143
Looking for this?

521
01:06:49,489 --> 01:06:50,634
Kohrn!

522
01:07:16,116 --> 01:07:18,122
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

523
01:07:18,195 --> 01:07:21,970
Don't touch me!
Let me go! Johnny!

524
01:07:23,893 --> 01:07:25,136
- Hey, Johnny!
- Let me go!

525
01:07:25,205 --> 01:07:26,731
Let her go, Johnny!

526
01:07:27,605 --> 01:07:28,914
Let her go, Johnny!

527
01:07:34,453 --> 01:07:36,275
Kohrn!

528
01:08:29,852 --> 01:08:31,674
Have you found your brother?

529
01:08:39,838 --> 01:08:40,917
Kohrn!

530
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:42,067
Kohrn!

531
01:08:43,327 --> 01:08:44,405
Kohrn!

532
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,332
Shit! An elephant!

533
01:08:46,398 --> 01:08:47,675
A real elephant!

534
01:08:49,694 --> 01:08:51,964
How did you get here?
Kohrn!

535
01:09:00,704 --> 01:09:02,133
Come, come.

536
01:09:36,133 --> 01:09:40,443
Rose, the heir to the business
should be Sim's son.

537
01:09:41,317 --> 01:09:44,961
But Chao is only thirteen.
He's still a child.

538
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,583
He doesn't yet have the ability
to run the family business.

539
01:09:47,654 --> 01:09:52,869
Then the most suitable person
should be Kang.

540
01:09:53,638 --> 01:09:56,093
He is the son of Third Aunt,

541
01:09:56,166 --> 01:10:00,160
who is the younger sister
of both Sim and your father.

542
01:10:00,231 --> 01:10:01,180
Um, that should be good.

543
01:10:01,255 --> 01:10:03,873
Kang has just graduated
in Management from England.

544
01:10:03,943 --> 01:10:06,333
He should be able to take good care
of the business.

545
01:10:06,409 --> 01:10:09,157
Why don't any of you think
about how I feel?

546
01:10:09,224 --> 01:10:11,613
I am also my father's child.

547
01:10:11,688 --> 01:10:15,912
I have devoted everything to this family.

548
01:10:16,809 --> 01:10:20,006
I would always help Uncle
when he was still alive.

549
01:10:21,162 --> 01:10:25,319
Take a good look at yourself.
You’re neither a man nor a woman.

550
01:10:25,386 --> 01:10:28,201
How do you expect us
to let you run the family business?

551
01:10:28,267 --> 01:10:31,114
We wouldn't be able
to show our faces in public.

552
01:10:32,427 --> 01:10:34,795
Kang! What's wrong with you?

553
01:10:34,860 --> 01:10:37,542
Please don't scare me. Help! Help!

554
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:42,851
You! Why did you do this?

555
01:10:42,924 --> 01:10:44,484
The most suitable person is dead...

556
01:10:45,869 --> 01:10:47,177
What's wrong? Tell me, Chao!

557
01:10:47,245 --> 01:10:51,523
...and the second is dying.
Is there anyone suitable left?

558
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:55,974
In that case, I accept the responsibility.

559
01:10:57,582 --> 01:10:59,239
I promise you all...

560
01:10:59,311 --> 01:11:02,660
I will make the family business
better than ever.

561
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:06,863
I won’t let you down.
I won’t let my father down.

562
01:11:08,751 --> 01:11:10,377
And I hope for the utmost cooperation
from you all.

563
01:11:11,601 --> 01:11:16,041
Authority says that this restaurant
has been the front of an illegal activity.

564
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:20,302
The owner has been accused for selling
and cooking endangered animals.

565
01:11:20,369 --> 01:11:22,922
And the most shocking of all,
that there are young girls from Thailand

566
01:11:22,993 --> 01:11:25,131
who have been sold as a prostitute.

567
01:11:25,201 --> 01:11:26,663
I can't say much right now,

568
01:11:26,738 --> 01:11:30,282
but our sources say that a number
of Thai police are involved in this.

569
01:11:31,313 --> 01:11:35,110
A Thai man with a red scarf
pops up often in these reports.

570
01:11:37,843 --> 01:11:39,369
At least we still have the girl.

571
01:11:39,443 --> 01:11:40,458
As bait.

572
01:11:45,556 --> 01:11:49,866
Johnny, you've been with me
ten years now.

573
01:11:49,941 --> 01:11:51,849
Do you still not understand me?

574
01:11:53,652 --> 01:11:58,290
What we are about to do
is of immense proportions.

575
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:02,962
But you can't even take care
a little operation like the restaurant.

576
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,612
How does make me look?

577
01:12:05,686 --> 01:12:08,588
You let those high losers,
get on my nerves.

578
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:12,176
And you still have the guts to face me?

579
01:12:13,718 --> 01:12:14,928
Get out of here.

580
01:12:22,136 --> 01:12:25,300
Leave it to me.
I'll take care of everything.

581
01:12:30,521 --> 01:12:32,910
You always seem to know what I want.

582
01:12:34,138 --> 01:12:36,723
How can I ever pay you back?

583
01:12:37,338 --> 01:12:38,831
Well, how about this?

584
01:12:39,641 --> 01:12:41,332
To return your kind favor,

585
01:12:41,402 --> 01:12:44,436
Let me get rid of those
who stuck their noses into our business.

586
01:12:46,171 --> 01:12:47,764
My sweetheart.

587
01:12:51,771 --> 01:12:53,232
It's no big deal.

588
01:12:53,820 --> 01:12:55,380
Let my men handle it.

589
01:12:57,116 --> 01:12:59,800
But what fun
is merely watching the prey,

590
01:12:59,869 --> 01:13:02,202
when we can hunt it ourselves?

591
01:13:17,247 --> 01:13:18,391
Be patient, Kohrn.

592
01:13:21,343 --> 01:13:23,033
We'll find Por Yai together..

593
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:31,419
Hey, you know
Where Cam and Mark are?

594
01:13:31,488 --> 01:13:32,765
We're looking for Cam and Mark.

595
01:13:32,834 --> 01:13:34,295
Cam and Mark.
You know who they are?

596
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:35,099
- No.
- No.

597
01:13:35,168 --> 01:13:38,397
- Come on, you must know.
- Where's Cam and Mark?

598
01:13:43,426 --> 01:13:44,571
Where is Mark?

599
01:13:45,442 --> 01:13:46,719
You better tell me now!

600
01:13:55,490 --> 01:13:57,596
...share with you that...

601
01:14:04,516 --> 01:14:05,923
Hey, Cam.

602
01:14:05,989 --> 01:14:07,101
We can't stay here anymore.

603
01:14:08,388 --> 01:14:11,006
I think we've disturbed you
enough, Father.

604
01:14:11,845 --> 01:14:13,633
Thank you very much
for your gracious assistance.

605
01:14:14,693 --> 01:14:16,635
Once you have stepped on fire,

606
01:14:16,709 --> 01:14:23,354
no matter how far you run,
your feet Will still burn.

607
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:26,972
At least we won’t cause you
any problems.

608
01:14:27,047 --> 01:14:30,342
I must go now, Father. Come on, Cam.

609
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:49,859
- What are you doing to do now?
- I must find Por Yai.

610
01:14:49,930 --> 01:14:51,838
I think that transsexual
knows something.

611
01:14:57,738 --> 01:14:59,493
I think we should
go back to the temple first.

612
01:15:07,852 --> 01:15:09,258
Father!

613
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:14,823
Someone, help!

614
01:15:14,893 --> 01:15:16,299
Get out quickly. Go on.

615
01:21:33,755 --> 01:21:34,965
Cam!

616
01:21:55,805 --> 01:21:57,943
You should take the elephant
back to Bangkok.

617
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,859
I have connections at the port.

618
01:21:59,934 --> 01:22:01,307
It would be easy for you to go back.

619
01:22:01,373 --> 01:22:02,867
What about you, Sarge?

620
01:22:02,941 --> 01:22:04,283
Don't worry about me.

621
01:22:59,172 --> 01:23:05,152
And I promise to bring our business empire
to new levels of greatness.

622
01:23:05,221 --> 01:23:06,498
Especially now.

623
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:10,722
We have the full collaboration
of the government and police.

624
01:23:11,814 --> 01:23:13,505
Since this is new beginning for us,

625
01:23:13,574 --> 01:23:18,275
may I be the first one to announce
a slight change of name

626
01:23:18,342 --> 01:23:19,836
of our business empire.

627
01:23:19,911 --> 01:23:21,601
Where's my elephant?

628
01:23:23,367 --> 01:23:24,611
Where is he?

629
01:23:54,602 --> 01:23:55,879
So...

630
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:58,468
Who am I gonna shoot first, huh?

631
01:23:59,949 --> 01:24:01,159
The elephant?

632
01:24:02,765 --> 01:24:04,106
Or the monkey?

633
01:24:18,701 --> 01:24:22,149
You... asshole.

634
01:24:23,567 --> 01:24:25,060
You piece of shit!

635
01:24:27,824 --> 01:24:28,837
Kohrn!

636
01:24:29,903 --> 01:24:31,147
You’re scum!

637
01:24:32,463 --> 01:24:33,837
Get on your feet!

638
01:24:33,905 --> 01:24:36,588
Your mother's a dirty whore.

639
01:24:37,393 --> 01:24:39,051
Get up. Get up!

640
01:24:59,763 --> 01:25:01,998
Johnny. Put the gun down.

641
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:04,779
Put the gun down!

642
01:25:06,259 --> 01:25:08,114
Johnny, put down the gun!

643
01:25:27,478 --> 01:25:29,419
I came to settle the score!

644
01:25:34,551 --> 01:25:38,325
You wanna catch me?
You know where to find me.

645
01:25:49,433 --> 01:25:51,821
This majestic elephant...

646
01:25:52,825 --> 01:25:53,937
...Will enhance your dominion.

647
01:25:54,713 --> 01:25:56,981
All will bow to you...

648
01:25:57,786 --> 01:25:59,826
...and the power which you hold.

649
01:34:31,575 --> 01:34:34,128
Kohrn! Kohrn!

650
01:34:35,863 --> 01:34:40,533
Kohrn! Kohrn!

651
01:35:02,042 --> 01:35:03,602
Stupid!

652
01:35:03,675 --> 01:35:05,617
Watch out!
What you done!

653
01:35:05,692 --> 01:35:07,185
Be careful my elephant!

654
01:35:07,260 --> 01:35:10,074
Bring him down.
Get down! Move!

655
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:57,510
An elephant is most vulnerable
at its tendons.

656
01:36:57,577 --> 01:36:59,943
If its tendons are severed, it will fall.

657
01:38:09,490 --> 01:38:11,180
Wait.

658
01:38:17,553 --> 01:38:20,423
Lower down, lower down, lower down.

659
01:38:21,203 --> 01:38:22,828
Up, up!

660
01:39:30,651 --> 01:39:31,796
Are you okay, Goong?

661
01:39:37,275 --> 01:39:40,178
A good man is always a good man,
no matter where he is.

662
01:39:42,076 --> 01:39:43,352
I have good news.

663
01:39:43,934 --> 01:39:45,307
Your new partner.

664
01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:50,876
Name?

665
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,150
Somsaka, sir.

666
01:39:52,861 --> 01:39:54,650
- God, are you Thai?
- Aren't I speaking clear enough?

667
01:39:54,717 --> 01:39:55,895
You sarcastic piece of shit!

668
01:39:55,967 --> 01:39:56,895
Excuse me.

669
01:39:56,958 --> 01:40:00,536
What about the reports of a Thai man
with a red scarf and a baby elephant?

670
01:40:31,235 --> 01:40:34,496
Elephants have represented Thailand
for many years.

671
01:40:34,563 --> 01:40:41,338
We respect them as if they were
our own brothers, our family.

672
01:40:41,411 --> 01:40:45,721
Thai people don't appreciate it
if anyone tries to hurt an elephant.

673
01:40:45,795 --> 01:40:50,846
Actually, Thai people like peace.
Peace! Peace, you know?

674
01:40:50,916 --> 01:40:54,363
But we don't like it,
when people take liberties.
