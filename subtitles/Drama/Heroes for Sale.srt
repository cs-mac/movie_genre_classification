1
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,446
These three shell holes are 1 o feet apart.

2
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,013
Split up your men
and put some of them in each hole.

3
00:01:06,182 --> 00:01:08,446
That's the heinie gun nest
in front of the holes?

4
00:01:08,618 --> 00:01:11,849
Yep, then you fan out from the shell holes
and attack with grenades.

5
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,785
- Looks like suicide, doesn't it, sir?
- Suicide or not, it's orders.

6
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,627
- I don't like this.
- Neither do I.

7
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,990
- How many men shall I take?
- Nine or 1 o.

8
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,689
That's all I can afford to lose.

9
00:01:29,739 --> 00:01:33,300
I'll go over this once more
to make sure everybody understands.

10
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:37,344
The object of this raid
is to take prisoners or a prisoner.

11
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,778
Preferably an officer.

12
00:01:39,949 --> 00:01:42,509
Take these three men
and go into the nearest shell hole.

13
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,050
Yes, sir.

14
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,350
Wells, you take those three men
into the furthest shell hole.

15
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:52,552
It'll take you longest to reach your objective,
so we'll be waiting for your signal.

16
00:01:53,429 --> 00:01:56,455
Tom will go with me
into the middle shell hole.

17
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:01,668
Two parties of four
will attack from the sides...

18
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,864
...while Holmes and I attack
from the center.

19
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:09,405
Remember, each man's life
depends on all of us.

20
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:13,913
If any one of us fails in his duty,
we'll probably all fail.

21
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:17,518
We leave in exactly 2o minutes.

22
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:25,285
- Heard from your mother lately, Tom?
- Got a letter yesterday.

23
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:27,554
I haven't heard from my folks
in over a month.

24
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:31,962
Mother wrote me she'd seen your dad
in the bank. Says he's looking swell.

25
00:02:32,135 --> 00:02:34,467
You scared, Roger?

26
00:02:34,637 --> 00:02:37,731
- Unofficially, yes.
- Me too.

27
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,568
Only you can make mine official.

28
00:03:41,671 --> 00:03:44,162
All right, Roger. Come on.

29
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:49,368
- Come on.
- No! No!

30
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,213
You dirty, yellow son of a...

31
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,913
- Aah!
- Come on, Fritz.

32
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,621
All right, we're going places.

33
00:04:59,182 --> 00:05:00,649
Roger...

34
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:03,443
Roger...

35
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:05,147
Take him in.

36
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,655
I'm gone.

37
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:25,162
More coffee, lieutenant?

38
00:05:26,509 --> 00:05:28,739
Nobody will know
how you got back in one piece.

39
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,243
It took plenty of nerve, no fooling.

40
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:35,048
- Listen, I didn't do anything...
Never mind the old modesty.

41
00:05:35,218 --> 00:05:36,913
This is too big to knock down.

42
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:41,589
But, really, I'm not entitled to...
- You're entitled to all decorations in the box.

43
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,089
And you'll get them.

44
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,685
- Attention.
- At ease.

45
00:05:46,863 --> 00:05:49,297
I just heard about it. Congratulations.

46
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:53,768
Thanks, major.

47
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,871
There's your man and an officer too.

48
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:07,871
Now that the armistice has been signed,
there's been an exchange of prisoners.

49
00:07:08,044 --> 00:07:10,911
You will be returned to your own lines.

50
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,106
That's good news, doctor.

51
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,846
You are in great pain. Hmm?

52
00:07:16,252 --> 00:07:19,050
- Yes, sir.
- Naturally.

53
00:07:19,222 --> 00:07:23,682
The x-ray shows you still have
steel splinters in your spinal column.

54
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,226
- Yes, sir.
- To remove them now...

55
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,660
...would be a dangerous
and a difficult operation.

56
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,490
You have not the strength.

57
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:34,192
We have not the facilities for doing it.

58
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:47,339
For some time,
this has helped you to endure your pain.

59
00:07:47,517 --> 00:07:48,814
Morphine.

60
00:07:49,752 --> 00:07:54,155
When you can no longer bear the pain,
take one of these.

61
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,526
That will be a godsend, doctor.

62
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:00,390
Goodbye, sir.

63
00:08:23,352 --> 00:08:24,683
Hello, boys.

64
00:08:24,854 --> 00:08:27,550
I brought you something to smoke.
Take a handful.

65
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,918
Much obliged, Major Winston.

66
00:08:32,128 --> 00:08:33,789
Smoke, buddy?

67
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:37,524
What's the use
if you can't see the smoke?

68
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,967
Oh.

69
00:08:42,238 --> 00:08:43,637
Here.

70
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,707
But didn't I hear them call you
Major Winston?

71
00:08:46,876 --> 00:08:48,366
That's right.

72
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,842
I heard you were onboard.

73
00:08:51,013 --> 00:08:54,540
I'm sure lucky
to have a chance of meeting you.

74
00:08:55,084 --> 00:08:58,884
It must be great to be going home
with a Distinguished Service Cross.

75
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,713
Just lucky, that's all.

76
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:02,690
- Major.
- Yeah?

77
00:09:02,858 --> 00:09:04,485
Have you got it on?

78
00:09:04,894 --> 00:09:07,454
No, but I have it with me.

79
00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:11,025
I used to think about getting one.

80
00:09:11,601 --> 00:09:13,728
Let me sort of touch it, will you?

81
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,527
Sure.

82
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,637
Here.

83
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:28,748
Roger. Oh, Roger.

84
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,110
Roger.

85
00:09:36,225 --> 00:09:38,591
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

86
00:09:50,873 --> 00:09:52,363
Tom.

87
00:09:53,109 --> 00:09:55,134
Tom, I can't believe...

88
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,838
You were killed.

89
00:09:58,414 --> 00:10:00,382
I saw you die.

90
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,483
They had me out there
among the clouds...

91
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,586
...but I bounced back just to fool them.

92
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:07,552
And look at you, a major.
All covered with decorations.

93
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:13,056
Tom, come down in my stateroom.

94
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:16,790
We've got to have a talk. Now. Come.

95
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:21,335
And there... There I was...

96
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:24,064
...everybody making a hero of me.

97
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,571
I accepted it because...

98
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:29,199
Because I didn't have guts enough
to refuse it.

99
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,938
It went on and on.

100
00:10:32,114 --> 00:10:34,378
The honors piled up.

101
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:38,953
And every one I got
made it more impossible to tell the truth.

102
00:10:39,121 --> 00:10:41,487
I couldn't let go.

103
00:10:41,857 --> 00:10:43,347
I'm not fooling myself.

104
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:48,987
I know that all my promotions
and decorations belong to you.

105
00:10:49,165 --> 00:10:52,896
I know that I've stolen the credit
from a real hero.

106
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:58,003
Sometimes it almost drove me crazy
when I thought you were dead.

107
00:10:58,174 --> 00:11:01,473
How do you suppose I feel now
knowing you're alive?

108
00:11:05,147 --> 00:11:06,444
Under the same conditions...

109
00:11:06,615 --> 00:11:09,106
...I probably would have done
just what you did.

110
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:11,549
And there's nothing we can do about it.

111
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,513
Nothing?

112
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:18,317
Unless you make me
the laughingstock of the world.

113
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,491
You know I wouldn't do that.

114
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:26,165
Besides, you're just the man for medals
and all that sort of thing.

115
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,235
You look the part.

116
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:30,271
I just don't.

117
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,406
- Oh, but, Tom, I've done you a terrible...
- Listen.

118
00:11:35,578 --> 00:11:37,375
Listen, Roger.

119
00:11:38,681 --> 00:11:41,946
I've been in the shadow of death
for so long...

120
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,951
...that nothing in life
seems very important anymore.

121
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,948
I hear he captured a whole
machine-gun nest single-handed.

122
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:19,952
You have to do that to get
the Distinguished Service Cross.

123
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:23,421
Yes, sir, Roger is a fine boy.
I always said so.

124
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:24,923
How do you do?
- Attention.

125
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:27,688
Attention, please. Please, everybody. Heh.

126
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:29,694
Mr. Roger will be right down, folks.

127
00:12:29,865 --> 00:12:32,231
He wants to shake hands
with everyone, personally.

128
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,891
Here he comes now.

129
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,162
- Now, move right over there.
Hang on a minute.

130
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,600
About ready? Hold it, major, will you?

131
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:42,835
Just as you are.

132
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,036
Much obliged, major.

133
00:12:44,213 --> 00:12:47,512
Now let's get one of you alone
at the bottom of the stairs.

134
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:11,899
Tom, I've got an extra blanket
for your bed.

135
00:13:12,074 --> 00:13:14,133
Just a second, Ma.

136
00:13:18,681 --> 00:13:20,581
What made you lock the door, dear?

137
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:24,344
Why, I'm so excited about getting home,
I guess I don't know what I'm doing.

138
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,284
It's just too wonderful.

139
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,661
Now, what are you crying for?
We're together again.

140
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:36,631
You look as if
you'd been through so much.

141
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,733
You look so tired.

142
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,599
I'll be all right.

143
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:47,299
A couple of weeks of your cooking
and I'll be as good as new.

144
00:14:22,077 --> 00:14:25,444
- Tom, the old man's boiling.
- What have I done now?

145
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:28,105
Oh, these Brower notes,
you've got them all mixed up.

146
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,014
- The figures don't balance at all.
- I'm sorry.

147
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:32,710
Now, total them up again quick.

148
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:35,448
The old man's on the warpath. Hurry up.

149
00:14:50,072 --> 00:14:53,132
Hey, Harry, what time is it?

150
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,072
Half past 1 o.

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,025
- Have you got it?
- An ounce.

152
00:15:20,202 --> 00:15:21,601
- How much?
- Two hundred.

153
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:24,705
Two hundred?
You gave it to me for 1 oo last time.

154
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:28,775
Didn't you read about the narcotic squad
knocking off the big shipment in New York?

155
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:31,378
- It's awful scarce.
- I've only got 1 oo.

156
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,208
Sorry.

157
00:15:33,382 --> 00:15:35,043
Well, give me half an ounce.

158
00:15:35,217 --> 00:15:37,811
I can't cut it up. Full ounce or nothing.

159
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:40,649
Well, what am I gonna do?
You know I've got to have it.

160
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:43,257
You'll see me go crazy
for the want of a few dollars?

161
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,292
You're working in a bank, ain't you?

162
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,037
Well, in case you change your mind,
you know where to find me.

163
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,379
This came in from the Federal Reserve.
Check it and enter it.

164
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,074
All right.

165
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,506
What's the matter, Tom? Are you sick?

166
00:17:13,649 --> 00:17:17,585
- Where's Tom Holmes?
- Why, he just stepped out, sir.

167
00:17:19,922 --> 00:17:21,253
He's out.

168
00:17:21,423 --> 00:17:23,653
And he can stay out
as far as I'm concerned.

169
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:27,728
He was shot up pretty bad. He's only been
out of the hospital for a few months.

170
00:17:27,896 --> 00:17:29,227
You've gotta have patience.

171
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:32,162
I don't mind telling you
my patience is exhausted.

172
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:36,736
He just hasn't found his groove yet.
He'll do better.

173
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:38,634
He's worse now than when he started.

174
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,173
Everything in the past few days
has been wrong.

175
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,903
He's not worth his salt.
I'm going to get rid of him.

176
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,775
- Now, Dad, please...
- Are you running this bank or am I?

177
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,974
You fellows forget the war is over.

178
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,415
Time to quit beating the drum
and waving the flag.

179
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:54,920
I'm paying this man a salary
and I expect him to do a man's work.

180
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:57,490
Doctor, you've got to do
something for me.

181
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,683
I can't stand it.

182
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:01,887
Tom, I keep telling you
I can't do a thing...

183
00:18:02,064 --> 00:18:04,464
...unless I report your case
to the authorities.

184
00:18:04,633 --> 00:18:08,660
No, you can't do that.
Don't you understand? My mother...

185
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,864
I've got to make a report
of what I do with every grain.

186
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,839
But I tell you you've got to
give me some. You've got to!

187
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,774
I'd lose my license.

188
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,380
They could send me to the penitentiary.

189
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,441
Then there's nothing you can do for me?

190
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:27,185
Not unless I report the case.

191
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:32,617
All right, but it's not my fault.

192
00:18:32,795 --> 00:18:35,593
It's not my fault if I steal,
if I kill somebody.

193
00:18:35,764 --> 00:18:38,392
I tell you, I'm going crazy.

194
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,201
Three-one-oh, please.

195
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,072
This the First National?

196
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:56,308
This is Dr. Briggs.

197
00:18:57,452 --> 00:19:00,444
I'd like to talk with Mr. Winston.

198
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:02,985
It's all here, Harry.

199
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,285
And a hundred-dollar bill all crumpled up.

200
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,621
Looks like it was tempted
to go see the world.

201
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:08,820
What's going on?

202
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,465
I don't know.
Mr. Winston said to count this quickly.

203
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,567
- Why, does he think Tom...?
- I don't know.

204
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:17,136
The place is in an uproar.
Tom's in there with him now.

205
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:21,072
I wonder if you realize what this does
to my standing in the community.

206
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,268
After 25 years of public confidence...

207
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:26,107
...I find myself with a drug addict
in my employ.

208
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,806
A drug addict
handling the depositors' money.

209
00:19:28,984 --> 00:19:32,010
An employee of mine
with this loathsome, cowardly habit.

210
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:34,454
I can't understand it.

211
00:19:34,623 --> 00:19:36,818
I know how carefully
your mother brought you up.

212
00:19:36,992 --> 00:19:39,187
The sacrifices she made
sending you to school...

213
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:42,023
...fitting you for a good,
clean Christian life.

214
00:19:42,197 --> 00:19:44,290
- This is a nice...
- Oh, wait a minute.

215
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:47,924
How do you think I started
taking that stuff, for fun or pleasure?

216
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,434
Well, I'll tell you how.

217
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:53,336
They gave it to me in a German hospital
to keep me from going mad with pain.

218
00:19:53,508 --> 00:19:55,772
Pain, agony, continual torture.

219
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,469
Day after day,
like a million ants eating me alive.

220
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:01,343
You know what that means?
No, you don't.

221
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:05,418
Because when I was being blown to bits,
you were sitting here safe and comfortable.

222
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:08,988
And you're still sitting here in judgment.

223
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,685
- You just ask your son how I happened...
- Tom.

224
00:20:12,861 --> 00:20:15,796
Calm down, Tom.
You're going to be all right.

225
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,022
We'll take care of you.

226
00:20:17,199 --> 00:20:19,599
If you're gonna take care of me,
tell him the truth.

227
00:20:19,768 --> 00:20:21,998
You turned yellow
and stayed in that shell hole.

228
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:24,638
I captured the German prisoner
and brought him to you.

229
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,468
Those decorations and honors you've got
belong to me...

230
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,238
...and how I paid for them
with my life's blood and a morphine habit.

231
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:35,611
Go on, tell him and blast some of that
self-satisfaction out of him.

232
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,124
Son...

233
00:20:48,297 --> 00:20:53,530
...all that he said about your
decoration was a lie, wasn't it?

234
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:00,234
Poor boy. Ahem.

235
00:21:00,409 --> 00:21:04,038
He's out of his head.
The ravings of a dope fiend.

236
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:08,508
I beg your pardon for asking, Roger.

237
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,513
I'm sorry for his mother.

238
00:21:13,789 --> 00:21:16,587
There's only one merciful course to take.

239
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,157
Get Judge Gorham for me, please.

240
00:23:25,587 --> 00:23:27,418
Well, I asked you. Go on.

241
00:23:27,589 --> 00:23:29,614
- You ever see an angel?
No.

242
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,884
Did you ever know a guy
who had seen an angel?

243
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,857
No.

244
00:23:54,316 --> 00:23:57,251
You're trying to tell me
the world ain't getting any better.

245
00:23:57,419 --> 00:23:59,819
It's getting worse.
But why is it getting worse?

246
00:23:59,988 --> 00:24:02,479
The burden of proof is on you, my friend.

247
00:24:02,657 --> 00:24:05,455
- Why is it getting better?
- Look how much longer people live.

248
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:08,653
I admit that,
but that only prolongs their suffering.

249
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:12,561
Well, if you think life is so awful,
why don't you cut your throat?

250
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:15,703
Because I can't afford to buy a knife.

251
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:18,597
Oh, you are stupid, my friend.

252
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:21,503
That's why you can't accept
the doctrines of Communism...

253
00:24:21,676 --> 00:24:23,405
...why you endure class servitude.

254
00:24:23,578 --> 00:24:28,675
You are a fish, a timid little rabbit,
a slinking mouse afraid to fight.

255
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,681
And what have you to lose, I ask you?

256
00:24:30,852 --> 00:24:33,184
Nothing but your chains.

257
00:24:33,355 --> 00:24:35,619
Stop, don't start that again.
- Well, we were...

258
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:37,621
Go on, go on, get those dishes washed.

259
00:24:37,792 --> 00:24:39,919
- Lenin once said...
- He ain't gonna say it here.

260
00:24:40,095 --> 00:24:41,357
Now, you go on upstairs.

261
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,361
All you do is talk everybody
into a stomachache.

262
00:24:48,503 --> 00:24:51,404
Don't stay up till all hours
burning up the electric light.

263
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:52,835
Oh.

264
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,842
They settle every problem in the world
four times a day.

265
00:24:59,014 --> 00:25:03,212
It's a regular bureau of misinformation.
Do you want some more coffee, son?

266
00:25:03,385 --> 00:25:06,047
- I thought it was tea.
- Well, we're famous for our coffee.

267
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:08,587
I was only kidding. It's great.

268
00:25:09,057 --> 00:25:12,458
- Say, you're a new face around here.
- Just blew into town.

269
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:15,118
You don't have to eat and run.
Go in the reading room.

270
00:25:15,297 --> 00:25:16,787
- Make yourself at home.
- Thanks.

271
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:20,128
If there's anything you wanna know here,
don't ask Pa, ask me.

272
00:25:20,302 --> 00:25:22,293
Know where I could get
a good cheap room?

273
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:25,962
Pa and me rent rooms in our flat upstairs.
We got a nice empty now.

274
00:25:26,141 --> 00:25:28,371
- Bedbugs?
- Only if you bring them.

275
00:25:28,543 --> 00:25:32,240
- Could I see it?
- Why, sure. Come on.

276
00:25:34,015 --> 00:25:36,210
Try and get paid for anything you sell.

277
00:25:36,551 --> 00:25:38,212
Mm-hm.

278
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:41,648
This is a lovely room.

279
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:44,986
The man that had it, Mr. Costigan,
was with us for over five years.

280
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,287
- What made him leave?
- He didn't exactly leave.

281
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,397
One nice Sunday afternoon,
the police came along and took him.

282
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:53,728
Yes, our flat is large, seven rooms.

283
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:56,462
There's only two other boarders.
You won't feel cramped.

284
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,162
Sounds good. How much you asking?

285
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,205
Well, we don't want
any more police around here.

286
00:26:00,375 --> 00:26:03,242
- Uh... You got references?
- No references.

287
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:05,372
- Folks?
- They're both dead.

288
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:08,141
- Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry.
- That's all right.

289
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:10,511
- You working?
- Looking for a job.

290
00:26:10,685 --> 00:26:12,312
Mm-hm.

291
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,183
- Any money?
- A little.

292
00:26:15,357 --> 00:26:19,885
Well, of course, I'm taking a chance,
but you look honest.

293
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:21,756
So did Mr. Costigan.

294
00:26:22,731 --> 00:26:25,564
Oh, this is a lovely bed.

295
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:28,066
I gave $ 15 for the mattress alone.

296
00:26:37,912 --> 00:26:40,210
It would be dark here
in the daytime, wouldn't it?

297
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:43,351
You're not supposed to be here.
You're to be out working.

298
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,577
Well, I don't know. I like a lot of sun.

299
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:49,588
Well, the park isn't far away.

300
00:26:49,758 --> 00:26:51,783
Mary, you home?

301
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,984
I'm in here, Ruth.

302
00:26:53,161 --> 00:26:56,358
She's roomed with us for over three years
and likes it.

303
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,365
Well, I think I'll look around
a little bit more. Maybe I can find...

304
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:03,133
Oh, excuse me, Mary.
I thought you were alone.

305
00:27:03,305 --> 00:27:07,469
Well, I was showing this man
the room, but I don't think he likes it.

306
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:11,678
Well, who said I didn't like it?

307
00:27:12,247 --> 00:27:15,876
- How much?
- Three dollars a week, payable in advance.

308
00:27:16,985 --> 00:27:19,215
- When do you wanna move in?
- I'm in now.

309
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:21,721
It's lucky I haven't got a trunk.

310
00:27:23,091 --> 00:27:26,754
Long as you two are under the same roof,
you might as well be introduced.

311
00:27:26,928 --> 00:27:29,863
- Miss Ruth Loring, meet Mr?
- Tom Holmes.

312
00:27:30,031 --> 00:27:31,726
Mr. Thomas Holmes.

313
00:27:32,167 --> 00:27:34,465
I'm pleased to make your acquaintance.

314
00:27:34,636 --> 00:27:36,297
Me too.

315
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:39,972
Well, I better get on downstairs
before Pa gives everything away.

316
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:45,005
Excuse me, I better go to bed now.

317
00:27:45,847 --> 00:27:47,405
Good night.

318
00:28:01,863 --> 00:28:04,627
Heh. There's a trick to it.

319
00:28:05,533 --> 00:28:07,467
Here, let me help you.

320
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,665
- Oh, you have to tie it down.
- There. Sure.

321
00:28:12,841 --> 00:28:15,275
- All the shades around here wanna stay up.
- So do I.

322
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,377
Won't you stay and talk for a minute?

323
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:20,070
I feel kind of lost in this new place.

324
00:28:20,248 --> 00:28:21,613
Well, I'd like to.

325
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:25,816
- I've been working all day and I better go.
- Where do you work?

326
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:30,086
- In a laundry.
- That ought to be a nice clean job.

327
00:28:31,526 --> 00:28:34,723
- Where do you work?
- I don't know yet, I'm looking for a job.

328
00:28:34,896 --> 00:28:37,558
- Well, why don't you try the laundry?
- I think I will.

329
00:28:41,836 --> 00:28:44,327
Sounds like we've got the Anvil Chorus
for neighbors.

330
00:28:44,506 --> 00:28:47,703
That's only Mr. Brinker, the German fellow.
That's his room there.

331
00:28:47,876 --> 00:28:50,140
- Well, why the noise?
- Oh, he invents things.

332
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:52,711
- What kind of things?
- I've never asked him.

333
00:28:52,881 --> 00:28:54,542
He's a Red.

334
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:58,279
How about going down to the drugstore
and getting a drink?

335
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:01,217
- Oh, some other time.
- I meant now.

336
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,758
All right, I'll go.
I'll go if I can buy my own.

337
00:29:04,926 --> 00:29:07,019
Don't worry about that.
I've got some money.

338
00:29:07,762 --> 00:29:09,787
My friend...

339
00:29:10,899 --> 00:29:12,423
...have you got a chisel?

340
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,591
Chisel? No.

341
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:21,601
I would sell my soul for a chisel.

342
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,710
That's the inventor.

343
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:28,576
- He's kind of cracked, isn't he?
- Yeah, a little bit.

344
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,913
I guess we're all kind of cracked
one way or another.

345
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:34,783
Maybe.

346
00:29:34,956 --> 00:29:37,948
Funny, here I was down in the dumps,
disgusted with everything.

347
00:29:38,126 --> 00:29:40,219
- And then you came along and...
- And what?

348
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:43,558
- Well, I'm a new man... just like that.
- Heh-heh-heh.

349
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:45,665
Tie a hook on that line and go fishing.

350
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:47,768
I will if you'll go with me.

351
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:51,633
Pop, what did you do with it?
- Well, I sold it.

352
00:29:51,806 --> 00:29:52,898
Then give me the money.

353
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:57,067
Well, I didn't exactly get any money,
but Joe will pay us tomorrow, sure.

354
00:29:57,245 --> 00:29:58,439
He said he would.

355
00:29:58,613 --> 00:30:00,672
Now, Pop, giving away
the last can of coffee.

356
00:30:00,849 --> 00:30:02,840
Tomorrow's Sunday,
the shops will be closed.

357
00:30:03,017 --> 00:30:04,348
Oh. What am I gonna do with you?

358
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,283
Somebody will lend us some coffee, Mary,
or something.

359
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:10,856
Oh. I was telling Pop
it's lucky the counter's nailed down...

360
00:30:11,025 --> 00:30:12,549
...or we'd all be eating off the floor.

361
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,461
You know, I think he's gonna like it here.

362
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:22,193
Mm-hm.

363
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,573
- How are you, Tom?
- Hi, Ed.

364
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,407
- How is it going? Good.
- Great.

365
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:38,046
- Hello, Tom. Get any new accounts today?
- Not today.

366
00:30:38,219 --> 00:30:40,779
- Twenty, 58, 63, 15, right?
- Right.

367
00:30:40,955 --> 00:30:43,082
The old man wants to see you right away.

368
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,522
That doesn't sound so good.

369
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,659
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

370
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:56,861
- Where you going?
- The boss wants to see me.

371
00:30:57,038 --> 00:30:59,734
- What's the matter?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

372
00:30:59,908 --> 00:31:01,466
Well, good luck, dear.

373
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:12,943
Sit down.

374
00:31:19,093 --> 00:31:22,324
- I wanna ask you a question, Holmes.
- Yes, sir.

375
00:31:22,497 --> 00:31:24,988
You probably know
that business is falling off.

376
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:28,033
Just one of those temporary slumps,
I hope.

377
00:31:28,202 --> 00:31:31,194
- Yes, sir.
- All our drivers...

378
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:33,671
...are losing trade.

379
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:35,502
AII, except you.

380
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,469
Your route has picked up 2o percent
in the last month.

381
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:43,678
How are you getting all this new business?
With a blackjack?

382
00:31:43,851 --> 00:31:45,284
No, sir.

383
00:31:45,453 --> 00:31:47,648
- With a merchandise order.
- Huh?

384
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:49,687
Every time
one of my regular customers...

385
00:31:49,857 --> 00:31:52,451
...gives me a lead
where I can get a new account...

386
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,822
...then I give her
a dollar merchandise order.

387
00:31:55,263 --> 00:31:58,960
You see, if Mrs. Jones gives me
the name of Mrs. Smith, I go to see her.

388
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:01,533
And if I can sell her
into doing business with us...

389
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:04,695
...why, then Mrs. Jones
gets a merchandise order.

390
00:32:05,406 --> 00:32:08,569
- Then what?
- Well, then I start working on Mrs. Smith.

391
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:10,870
She's got friends and relations
and all that.

392
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,775
She sells me to Mrs. Brown
and then she gets an order.

393
00:32:13,948 --> 00:32:15,438
It's kind of an endless chain.

394
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:19,351
Why, it's nothing but a new twist
on the old premium plan.

395
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,216
- But who pays for the merchandise orders?
- Oh, I do.

396
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,517
I've got a hardware store
on Archer Avenue...

397
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,252
...and a dry-goods store
over on Taft Street.

398
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:30,727
They print the merchandise orders
and exchange them for goods.

399
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:32,866
My increased commissions
more than cover...

400
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,231
I'll say they do. More than cover.

401
00:32:36,404 --> 00:32:38,702
Holmes, where did you get this scheme?

402
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,534
Why, I don't know.

403
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:44,371
I was trying to think of a way to build up
my route and make a little extra.

404
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,137
I guess the idea just hit me.

405
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:49,613
Why didn't somebody else here
think of it? Why didn't I?

406
00:32:49,784 --> 00:32:52,947
We'll start a regular merchandise
premium plan.

407
00:32:53,121 --> 00:32:56,090
Give away dishes, vacuum cleaners,
maybe even cash bonuses...

408
00:32:56,257 --> 00:32:58,589
...to our old customers
who get us new customers.

409
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,320
- It's marvelous.
- It seems to work out all right.

410
00:33:01,496 --> 00:33:03,259
If I can keep that route of mine
going along...

411
00:33:03,431 --> 00:33:07,299
Ha-ha. Here less than three months and
you figure out a business-builder like this?

412
00:33:07,468 --> 00:33:10,926
Keep that route? Waste your ability
letting you drive a laundry truck?

413
00:33:11,105 --> 00:33:12,333
Don't be silly.

414
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:16,877
Get Travis, Blake and all the other drivers
up here right away.

415
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:22,777
My boy, you're going to get
a real job around here.

416
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:31,024
Primping for Tom again, eh?
Trying to look pretty.

417
00:33:31,192 --> 00:33:33,558
No, just trying to look less
like the family.

418
00:33:33,728 --> 00:33:35,286
Oh.

419
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,466
- Pop.
- What's the matter now?

420
00:33:41,636 --> 00:33:44,104
Where's the leg of veal
that was in the icebox?

421
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,399
Oh, was there a leg of veal in there?

422
00:33:46,574 --> 00:33:49,441
Now, don't you start acting innocent.
What did you do with it?

423
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,670
Well, I... Well, Frank Martin, his wife...

424
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:57,546
Well, she's kind of sick and he ain't
exactly got a job, so I sold it to him.

425
00:33:57,719 --> 00:34:00,210
Oh, Pop, for goodness' sake.

426
00:34:00,388 --> 00:34:04,119
Oh, Mary, he'll pay us in a couple of days.
His wife is sick and...

427
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,623
Well, I'm sick too.

428
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,353
I'm sick of you trying to feed
everybody, free.

429
00:34:09,197 --> 00:34:12,098
- Where's Ruth?
- Upstairs, if Pop hasn't given the flat away.

430
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:14,757
Well, come on.
I've got something great to tell you.

431
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:16,494
Yeah?

432
00:34:17,939 --> 00:34:20,373
The idea came to me one day
when I was driving along.

433
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:22,805
Mr. Gibson's gonna make you
Blake's assistant?

434
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,968
- He's done it.
- He didn't raise your salary.

435
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:26,977
- He sure did.
- Tom, I'm so proud of you.

436
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,139
Oh, there's a catch in it somewhere.

437
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,376
Are you stupid enough to think
this Gibson...

438
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,180
...this dirty capitalist
is interested in your welfare?

439
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:35,379
He's proven it.

440
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,490
Everyone who works for him loves him.

441
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:41,355
And he loves all of you too.
Loves you because you're stupid and docile.

442
00:34:41,529 --> 00:34:43,520
Because he can change your sweat
into money.

443
00:34:43,698 --> 00:34:45,689
Because he can use you, exploit you.

444
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:48,062
All for the few stinking pennies
he pays you.

445
00:34:48,236 --> 00:34:51,501
Max, you're crazy.
Working conditions are swell there.

446
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,074
You trying to tell me about laundries?

447
00:34:57,411 --> 00:35:02,371
<i>Listen, yungah, I used to be chief engineer
of the biggest laundry in Cleveland.</i>

448
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:08,785
Long hours, short wages, steam,
sweat, consumption, slavery.

449
00:35:10,258 --> 00:35:12,453
And you all love him.

450
00:35:14,962 --> 00:35:16,657
Sheep!

451
00:35:19,133 --> 00:35:21,431
When you get to be my age...

452
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:24,431
...you'll have a bomb in every pocket.

453
00:35:27,909 --> 00:35:29,536
He's getting awful Red.

454
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,543
It won't be long before he puts a bomb
in the coffee urn.

455
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,840
Oh, forget that maniac.
You did a great thing.

456
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:37,416
We all ought to celebrate.
Let's get some chop suey.

457
00:35:37,585 --> 00:35:39,246
- I'd love it.
- No, you kids go ahead.

458
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,411
- I haven't got a thing to wear.
- You have.

459
00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:44,023
- What's the matter with your blue crepe?
- The hem.

460
00:35:44,192 --> 00:35:47,992
- Well, go on, fix it, we'll wait.
- All right, it'll just take a few minutes.

461
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:58,734
Things have changed for me
in the last few months.

462
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:01,204
- I've got a good job.
- And a lot of good friends.

463
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,570
I've been awful lucky since I came here.

464
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,975
This old town
certainly looks different than it did.

465
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,519
You were kind of lonesome at first,
weren't you?

466
00:36:12,687 --> 00:36:14,587
I guess I was.

467
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:17,356
And you're not anymore?

468
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,285
Ruth.

469
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,585
You all ready, Mary?

470
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,092
It'd take me all night to finish this hem.

471
00:36:55,263 --> 00:36:58,562
You kids go on ahead.
I'll see you when you get back.

472
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:47,777
Oh, Mary, I'm so excited.
I actually tingle all over.

473
00:37:47,949 --> 00:37:50,474
Oh, it's darling. It's beautiful, Mary.

474
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:52,016
I thought you'd like it.

475
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,950
Like it? Oh, Mary, I love it.

476
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:57,750
Oh, and it matches,
it just matches the bassinet.

477
00:37:57,925 --> 00:37:59,722
What does Tom think about all this?

478
00:37:59,894 --> 00:38:01,191
Oh, he's walking on air.

479
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,490
Come on,
and I'll show you them bassinet.

480
00:38:06,467 --> 00:38:08,662
- Hmm.
- Why, hello, stranger.

481
00:38:08,836 --> 00:38:11,361
- I must have $ 15oo at once.
- What for?

482
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,598
I've got it,
the greatest thing in the world.

483
00:38:13,774 --> 00:38:16,038
Make me rich, make you rich,
if you help me.

484
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,373
Remember I used to be chief engineer
of a big laundry for years?

485
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,414
I know, but wait a minute.
Calm down. What's this all about?

486
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:25,711
My invention. I will revolutionize
the whole laundry business.

487
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:29,481
But I must have $ 15oo to patent it
before somebody steals it.

488
00:38:29,657 --> 00:38:30,681
Well, why come to me?

489
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:33,053
You have a job, you work steady,
you save money.

490
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,219
- I haven't got any money.
- You have enough so I can get a patent.

491
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:39,798
You can take my machine to your boss.
He listens to you, trusts you.

492
00:38:39,967 --> 00:38:40,991
Nobody listens to me.

493
00:38:41,168 --> 00:38:43,932
I'm a Red, a radical. They say I'm crazy.

494
00:38:44,372 --> 00:38:45,498
I don't blame them much.

495
00:38:45,673 --> 00:38:49,803
Crazy or not, I graduated with honors
from the Berliner Technische Hochschule.

496
00:38:49,977 --> 00:38:51,604
I am a great technician...

497
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:54,839
...and I have invented a combination
washing machine and mangle...

498
00:38:55,016 --> 00:38:57,450
...which will increase production
a thousand percent.

499
00:38:57,618 --> 00:38:59,108
I can help your employer.

500
00:38:59,286 --> 00:39:01,982
Wait, I thought you hated
all employers and capitalists.

501
00:39:02,156 --> 00:39:03,623
I despise them, I spit on them.

502
00:39:05,026 --> 00:39:07,119
But I'm willing to get rich with them.

503
00:39:07,294 --> 00:39:10,161
If you don't sit down,
you're gonna have a stroke.

504
00:39:10,331 --> 00:39:12,390
A machine that will increase production?

505
00:39:12,566 --> 00:39:16,764
- In two hours, it does a whole day's work.
- Gosh, what a kick.

506
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,462
Means more leisure,
more time at home with your family.

507
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:22,131
Oh, plenty of time home with the family.

508
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:25,176
- Sounds too good to be true.
- You see it with your own eyes.

509
00:39:25,346 --> 00:39:26,643
Then you give me the money.

510
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:29,705
I'm paying for this furniture,
every penny I've got.

511
00:39:29,884 --> 00:39:31,511
Give it all back. Get the money.

512
00:39:31,685 --> 00:39:33,710
One chance in a hundred lifetimes.

513
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,379
Oh, what's all the excitement about? Heh.

514
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:39,689
Besides, Max,
here's the best reason in the world.

515
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,886
I need every penny I make.

516
00:39:42,063 --> 00:39:43,291
I'm gonna have a baby.

517
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,761
We're going to have a baby.

518
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:48,231
What good is a baby?
Anybody can have a baby.

519
00:39:48,402 --> 00:39:50,393
Yeah? Well, you just try it sometime.

520
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:54,634
Increase and multiply like rabbits.

521
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,972
Make more poor people for the rich
to prey upon, starve and exploit.

522
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,739
Max, you're daffy.
If everybody felt like that...

523
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:03,406
...there wouldn't be any people left,
only machines.

524
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,074
Wouldn't it be a better world?

525
00:40:05,252 --> 00:40:09,018
I am giving birth to something
more important than millions of babies.

526
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,250
Well, don't deliver it around here
or we'll have to have the place fumigated.

527
00:40:16,263 --> 00:40:19,323
It means more leisure and freedom.
You're not taking any chances.

528
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:23,095
I saw this thing work with my own eyes.
I put every cent I've got into it.

529
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:26,603
Well, Tom, if you got faith in it,
I guess I can gamble $2o.

530
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:28,139
All right, Bessie.

531
00:40:28,309 --> 00:40:29,833
Would you take a dollar?

532
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,343
As much or as little as you like.
This is a community proposition.

533
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:35,982
Well, if it's good enough for you, pal,
I can go 15.

534
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,583
All right, Ed.

535
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:39,480
Ed Brady, $ 15.

536
00:40:40,421 --> 00:40:43,322
Now, let me see if I've got all this.

537
00:40:43,491 --> 00:40:46,483
The basic patent remains the property
of Brinker, the inventor...

538
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,184
...and Holmes, the promoter.

539
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:52,924
Mr. Gibson simply pays them a royalty
for the use of the machines.

540
00:40:53,501 --> 00:40:54,559
That's right.

541
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:58,470
Say, Tom, it might be pretty cumbersome
having all these people...

542
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,302
...with 5-, 1 o-, 15-dollar interests
mixed up in the transaction.

543
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:06,503
Can I pay them back what they put in
with a hundred-percent dividend...

544
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,908
...and get their releases?

545
00:41:08,082 --> 00:41:10,448
Well, I don't know.
I'll tell you in the morning.

546
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:13,644
- Fine.
- Is there anything else you want included?

547
00:41:13,821 --> 00:41:17,257
- Not me.
- Yes, sir, one thing, very important.

548
00:41:17,424 --> 00:41:20,325
These machines must not be used
to throw anybody out of work...

549
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:21,620
...or to cut salaries.

550
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:23,786
We're leasing them to you
for one purpose:

551
00:41:23,964 --> 00:41:27,331
To increase production, making jobs easier
and to make our working hours shorter.

552
00:41:27,501 --> 00:41:30,800
Heh-heh. You're a real humanitarian, Tom.

553
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:33,001
Well, how about it, Mr. Gibson?

554
00:41:33,174 --> 00:41:35,938
Go ahead. Put it in the contract.
I'm with Tom 1 oo percent.

555
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:38,408
Mr. Gibson's in conference.
You can't go in there.

556
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,571
I don't wanna see Mr. Gibson,
I wanna see Tom Holmes.

557
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,273
Get over or I'll call the police.

558
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:45,850
You will get out of my way
or I'll sock you in the jaw.

559
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:50,452
Tom, come quick.
Ruth just went to the hospital.

560
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:52,956
- Gosh, when?
- Just a few minutes ago. Come on.

561
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:55,254
Hope it's a boy.
- I'll take anything I can get.

562
00:42:01,368 --> 00:42:03,928
- Did you get our check?
- Ruth just went to the hospital.

563
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:08,541
Well, what has Ruth got to do with it?
Where is our check?

564
00:42:08,976 --> 00:42:10,443
She's having a baby.

565
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:12,476
So much excitement for what?

566
00:42:12,646 --> 00:42:14,341
The world is full of babies.

567
00:42:14,515 --> 00:42:16,915
Even billy goats have babies.

568
00:42:59,393 --> 00:43:01,827
Heh. Breakfast, Bill.

569
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:04,231
I wanna run my auto.

570
00:43:04,398 --> 00:43:06,866
Well, you can do that all day.
Go on, Bill, get your breakfast.

571
00:43:08,235 --> 00:43:09,566
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, dear.

572
00:43:09,737 --> 00:43:11,034
I'll go.

573
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:15,632
Bill, come back here.
Where do you think you're going?

574
00:43:15,809 --> 00:43:17,299
I wanna run my auto.

575
00:43:17,478 --> 00:43:20,914
Now, don't you be a little monkey.
You come on and do as Mommy says.

576
00:43:21,081 --> 00:43:23,447
Why can't I run my auto?

577
00:43:23,617 --> 00:43:26,415
Now, I told you, honey, after breakfast.

578
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:30,684
Mr. Gibson's had a heart attack.

579
00:43:31,792 --> 00:43:33,259
He's not?

580
00:43:33,427 --> 00:43:36,396
Yeah, he's dead.

581
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,764
Oh.

582
00:43:47,975 --> 00:43:49,738
It's childishly simply, L.M.

583
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:53,141
We replace these gears
with a centripetal cam.

584
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,572
Can't understand why Gibson didn't.
Neither can I.

585
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,186
Then we install a photoelectric cell,
which controls the whole thing.

586
00:44:00,354 --> 00:44:02,288
It'll make the whole job automatic?

587
00:44:02,456 --> 00:44:03,787
Absolutely.

588
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,822
How many employees
do you estimate we could drop?

589
00:44:06,994 --> 00:44:09,394
Three-quarters
of your entire manual labor.

590
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:11,593
Cut our expenses almost to nothing.

591
00:44:11,765 --> 00:44:14,325
That's what I've been telling you, L.M.

592
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:17,365
- It wouldn't cost much to install?
- Whatever it costs...

593
00:44:17,538 --> 00:44:20,530
...you'll more than save
in your wages in the first year.

594
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:29,445
How long would it take
to install these machines?

595
00:44:29,616 --> 00:44:31,880
Sixty days, maybe less.

596
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:35,618
Hop to it, Jim. Work night and day.
Never mind the expense.

597
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:03,843
Wait a minute. Give me a chance.

598
00:45:04,017 --> 00:45:07,680
You made us raise the money ourselves
for the machine that starves us to death.

599
00:45:07,855 --> 00:45:10,323
You've got your money back
with a profit, 1 oo percent.

600
00:45:10,724 --> 00:45:13,625
What we got won't keep us a month
without our jobs.

601
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:17,821
I put up 1 o bucks and got 2o back
and lost a job that paid me 3o a week.

602
00:45:17,998 --> 00:45:20,933
- Yeah, more leisure, more freedom.
- Pbbt.

603
00:45:23,737 --> 00:45:24,761
Listen to me.

604
00:45:24,938 --> 00:45:28,169
I put it in the agreement
that none of us were to lose our jobs.

605
00:45:28,342 --> 00:45:31,334
- Oh, shut up. We got fired, ain't we?
- You're a liar.

606
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,776
Did you put in the agreement
how we're gonna eat?

607
00:45:33,947 --> 00:45:35,710
Yeah, yeah.

608
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:40,252
I've been fighting the new bosses to show
them how they broke the agreement.

609
00:45:40,421 --> 00:45:42,252
You sure must have been
tough with them.

610
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,050
You're still working, ain't you?

611
00:45:44,224 --> 00:45:45,714
No, they fired me today.

612
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,603
- I keep telling you...
- That's just a bunk, trying to cover up.

613
00:45:57,771 --> 00:46:00,501
- I'll bet you got a raise in salary.
Sure he did!

614
00:46:00,674 --> 00:46:04,166
If you'd listen to me. We got a legal case.
You can take it into court.

615
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,107
Ah. Take it to court. That's great.

616
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,272
The lawyers get fat
while our children starve to death.

617
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:11,418
Why beat around the bush this way?

618
00:46:11,585 --> 00:46:12,950
Why did we get fired?

619
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,917
What put us out of work?

620
00:46:15,088 --> 00:46:17,079
The machines!

621
00:46:17,958 --> 00:46:20,927
That's right, the machines did it.
The machines ruined us.

622
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:23,995
They grabbed our jobs away.
They wrecked our homes.

623
00:46:24,164 --> 00:46:26,189
Are we gonna take it laying down?

624
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,799
No.

625
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,433
Please, wait a minute.
That's what I've been waiting to hear.

626
00:46:33,607 --> 00:46:36,474
Smash the machines
that has been smashing you.

627
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:38,338
Come on, let's go. Come on.

628
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,375
That's not the way, men. You're crazy.

629
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:49,078
If you smash the machines,
they'll only build more.

630
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,252
- I've gotta stop them.
- No, Tom, you mustn't.

631
00:46:54,428 --> 00:46:56,453
Tom, they'll kill you. Tom!

632
00:46:56,630 --> 00:47:00,964
- Tom.
Mommy, Mommy.

633
00:47:01,134 --> 00:47:02,897
Mommy.

634
00:47:11,211 --> 00:47:12,906
- Mommy.
- Oh, Bill.

635
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,174
- You shouldn't have gotten out of bed.
- The noise woke me up.

636
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,682
I know, darling, I know.
But it's all over now.

637
00:47:18,852 --> 00:47:21,252
Now be a good baby and go to sleep.

638
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:24,787
Michigan-3724.

639
00:47:24,958 --> 00:47:27,654
What were all those men
saying to Daddy?

640
00:47:27,828 --> 00:47:30,991
No more questions now, Bill.
Mind Mommy and go to sleep.

641
00:47:32,499 --> 00:47:36,595
Hello, Mary, this is Ruth.
Come right over, will you? Yeah, hurry.

642
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,849
- Hey, wait a minute, fellas.
Quiet down.

643
00:47:52,019 --> 00:47:55,011
Haven't you got any sense?
Riot guns will be there to meet you.

644
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:57,315
All you'll do is get these people arrested.

645
00:47:57,491 --> 00:48:00,858
Oh, shut up.
We don't want no more of your advice.

646
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,729
Come on, fellows,
grab these bricks and bats.

647
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:05,228
Come on, let's go.

648
00:48:58,952 --> 00:49:00,442
Stay with Bill till I get back.

649
00:49:00,621 --> 00:49:02,953
- What's the matter?
- I'll tell you later.

650
00:49:07,561 --> 00:49:10,724
What good will it do you?
They've got you licked before you start.

651
00:49:10,897 --> 00:49:13,297
If you don't get shot,
they're a cinch to put you in the pen.

652
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:31,611
I'll give you exactly one minute
to break up and go home.

653
00:49:31,785 --> 00:49:33,810
- What home?
- We ain't got no home.

654
00:49:33,987 --> 00:49:36,046
Our homes,
that's what we're fighting about.

655
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,054
Yeah.

656
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,886
You see? You haven't got a chance.

657
00:50:33,346 --> 00:50:34,643
Tom.

658
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:36,646
Tom. Aah!

659
00:50:37,517 --> 00:50:39,246
Tom!

660
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:42,554
Tom. Tom.

661
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,456
No! No!

662
00:50:46,159 --> 00:50:48,059
Tom!

663
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:08,003
That's my wife. Let me go, let me go.

664
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:11,173
No way, buddy, and that goes double.

665
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:14,848
Where's Mama? I want Mama.

666
00:51:15,021 --> 00:51:16,545
Mama is...

667
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:17,849
She's gone away, Bill.

668
00:51:18,024 --> 00:51:19,719
Why didn't she take me with her?

669
00:51:19,893 --> 00:51:22,885
Well, she didn't have time, darling.

670
00:51:23,063 --> 00:51:25,588
When is she coming back?

671
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,692
Soon, Bill. She'll be back soon.

672
00:51:30,871 --> 00:51:35,774
Who's going to get me
my breakfast tomorrow? You?

673
00:51:35,942 --> 00:51:38,934
No, Aunt Mary will.
She'll take care of you, Bill.

674
00:51:39,112 --> 00:51:43,105
You mean just till my mama comes back?

675
00:51:43,283 --> 00:51:45,843
Till your mama comes back.

676
00:51:48,421 --> 00:51:51,015
I'll be lonesome without Mama.

677
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,955
Will you stay home and play with me?

678
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:56,625
Maybe, Bill.

679
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:05,070
Daddy, what are you crying for?

680
00:52:05,238 --> 00:52:06,967
Come on, hurry up.

681
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:24,486
Daddy, stay here. Don't go away.

682
00:52:24,658 --> 00:52:26,421
I want you to stay here.

683
00:52:26,593 --> 00:52:29,619
Daddy, stay here. Don't go away.

684
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,892
I want you to stay here.

685
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,768
Now, now, Bill.

686
00:52:35,936 --> 00:52:39,337
Bill, be a big man now.

687
00:52:39,506 --> 00:52:42,532
Soldiers don't cry, no.

688
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:49,682
Tried and convicted of the serious
crime of leading a mob and inciting to riot.

689
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:53,581
A heinous attack on the stability
of organized society...

690
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:57,280
...resulting in the death
of four officers of the law.

691
00:52:57,457 --> 00:52:58,822
Thomas Holmes...

692
00:52:58,992 --> 00:53:02,928
...I hereby sentence you
to serve a term of five years...

693
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:06,691
...of hard labor in the state penitentiary.

694
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:18,434
Hello, Max.

695
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:21,410
Didn't I tell you I'd make you rich?
All right, you are rich.

696
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:25,142
Western Laundries installed it
in all their Kansas City and St. Louis plants.

697
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,186
We're getting $2ooo a month royalty,
and it's only just starting.

698
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:32,348
The rest of America
must wash their clothes too.

699
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,618
- More people out of jobs.
- What of it?

700
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,421
You fool, you idiot.

701
00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:39,463
Why, you already have an income
of a thousand dollars a month.

702
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:43,399
Why, you can hire the best lawyers,
bribe everybody...

703
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:45,504
...buy your way out of here.

704
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:51,270
- I wouldn't touch that money.
- You...? You would refuse money?

705
00:53:51,444 --> 00:53:52,968
Yeah.

706
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,407
Because it killed Ruth
and ruined all my friends.

707
00:53:57,584 --> 00:53:59,051
There's blood on it.

708
00:53:59,219 --> 00:54:02,017
I couldn't take a profit
on people starving to death.

709
00:54:02,188 --> 00:54:05,055
You enjoy this prison?
You like to sit here and rot?

710
00:54:05,225 --> 00:54:06,283
Blood on the money.

711
00:54:06,459 --> 00:54:08,950
Who asks you what's on the money
when you spend it?

712
00:54:09,129 --> 00:54:12,690
There's only one thing
important in the world.

713
00:54:12,866 --> 00:54:14,663
To have money.

714
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:17,302
Without it, you are just garbage.

715
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:19,563
With it, you are a king.

716
00:54:19,739 --> 00:54:21,604
And you used to hate the capitalists.

717
00:54:21,775 --> 00:54:24,744
Naturally, that was before I had money.

718
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:27,475
You can keep my money
if you think so much of it.

719
00:54:27,647 --> 00:54:29,740
Throw it away, give it away,
do anything you want.

720
00:54:31,117 --> 00:54:32,482
I'll put it in the bank.

721
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:36,645
While you're recovering from your insanity,
it can be drawing interest.

722
00:55:23,303 --> 00:55:24,634
Why, Tom.

723
00:55:24,804 --> 00:55:26,999
Mary, how's Bill?

724
00:55:27,173 --> 00:55:30,836
Oh, he's fine. You'd hardly know him.
He's a big boy now.

725
00:55:31,277 --> 00:55:32,471
And how are you?

726
00:55:32,645 --> 00:55:36,137
Oh, I'm all right. I never change much.

727
00:55:47,694 --> 00:55:48,786
Hello, Dad.

728
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,658
Hello, Bill.

729
00:55:54,501 --> 00:55:55,968
I'm awful glad you're home.

730
00:55:56,136 --> 00:55:57,569
Me too.

731
00:55:57,737 --> 00:55:59,762
Oh, gee.

732
00:56:00,473 --> 00:56:01,667
Gee, you're big.

733
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:06,039
Sure. I licked Johnny Arnold,
and he weighs almost 8o pounds.

734
00:56:06,212 --> 00:56:08,806
You did? Well, that's great.

735
00:56:09,482 --> 00:56:11,450
Come on, sit down.

736
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:16,050
I can swim, too, real good.

737
00:56:16,656 --> 00:56:18,988
If I stayed away longer,
you'd have forgotten me.

738
00:56:19,159 --> 00:56:22,856
Oh, no. Aunt Mary talked to me
about you all the time.

739
00:56:23,029 --> 00:56:24,894
There's a big map in my geography.

740
00:56:25,065 --> 00:56:29,092
She used to show me
just what part of Alaska you were in.

741
00:56:29,269 --> 00:56:31,430
I guess I wasn't very hard
to keep track of.

742
00:56:31,604 --> 00:56:33,902
But why'd you stay away so long?

743
00:56:34,074 --> 00:56:37,202
Well, Bill, Alaska is pretty far away.

744
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:40,042
You could have come home
once in a while.

745
00:56:41,114 --> 00:56:42,581
It gets awful cold up there.

746
00:56:42,749 --> 00:56:45,809
Sometimes, you get snowed in
and you can't get out for a year.

747
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:48,749
- I bet there's good ice skating.
- Oh, sure.

748
00:56:48,922 --> 00:56:51,755
Do they have polar bears up there,
like I saw in the zoo?

749
00:56:51,925 --> 00:56:53,654
Oh, lots of them.

750
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,727
- What grade are you in, Bill?
- High third.

751
00:56:55,895 --> 00:56:57,658
Did you go hunting a lot?

752
00:56:57,964 --> 00:56:59,488
Some.

753
00:56:59,666 --> 00:57:01,998
- Can you ride a bicycle yet?
- I got a bicycle.

754
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:05,228
Gee, I'd like to go hunting.
Will you take me next time?

755
00:57:05,972 --> 00:57:09,032
Well, I hope
I don't have to go up there anymore.

756
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:12,037
Come in.

757
00:57:12,212 --> 00:57:14,043
Hello, Max.
- Well, well, well.

758
00:57:14,214 --> 00:57:16,546
- So the prodigal has returned.
- Yes, I got out...

759
00:57:16,716 --> 00:57:19,014
- Got back today.
- It looks good to see you once more.

760
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,176
Hah. Mary phoned me they expected you.

761
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,378
Hello, little Billy.

762
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:24,750
Go look out the window,
I wanna talk with Papa.

763
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:26,255
- That's a good boy.
Sit down.

764
00:57:26,426 --> 00:57:29,691
No, I can't. I have a dinner engagement
at the University Club.

765
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:34,357
But this will welcome you home
better than I could.

766
00:57:38,004 --> 00:57:39,699
Gee.

767
00:57:42,976 --> 00:57:46,309
A lot of money, huh?
I guess now you can stand the blood on it.

768
00:57:46,479 --> 00:57:48,572
Every month like clockwork
comes your check.

769
00:57:48,748 --> 00:57:52,741
A little bit less now on account
of the Depression, but it will do.

770
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:55,486
There they are.

771
00:58:03,796 --> 00:58:05,457
- What is it, Bill?
- Poor people.

772
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:08,192
Aunt Mary feeds them every night, free.

773
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:09,392
All that's left over.

774
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:12,732
You mean she gives good food away
to those tramps?

775
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:26,150
There you are, my friend.
That's some real good soup.

776
00:58:27,453 --> 00:58:29,478
- There you are.
Here we go, a big one.

777
00:58:29,656 --> 00:58:31,954
I'll have some soup, please.
Some soup.

778
00:58:32,125 --> 00:58:34,457
You'll find salt and pepper down there.

779
00:58:34,627 --> 00:58:37,790
- Glad to see you out again.
Thank you, Pop. God bless you.

780
00:58:37,964 --> 00:58:40,091
- How's your husband?
Thanks very much.

781
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:49,039
All right. We're running out, Pop.
You better close up.

782
00:58:49,209 --> 00:58:51,541
What, no more? Oh, that's too bad.

783
00:58:51,711 --> 00:58:54,646
- Are you sure, Mary?
- There you... Yes, I'm sure, Pop.

784
00:58:54,814 --> 00:58:56,782
Well, good evening, and how are you?

785
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,614
- You want stew?
- I'm sorry, folks, but there isn't any more.

786
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:04,256
I'm sure the Salvation Army
will take care of you.

787
00:59:04,424 --> 00:59:05,686
Come back tomorrow.

788
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:07,382
- Good night. I'm sorry.
No more?

789
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,221
- No, there isn't any more.
One more.

790
00:59:09,395 --> 00:59:11,556
I'm sorry. No, I'm...

791
00:59:30,216 --> 00:59:32,741
Feed them once
and you have to feed them all the time.

792
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:36,980
Charity. Feeding a lot of lazy moochers.

793
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:39,056
- Were you ever hungry?
- Hmm?

794
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:41,349
Mary.

795
00:59:41,894 --> 00:59:45,728
Gee, there's more and more people
every night.

796
00:59:47,133 --> 00:59:49,931
There's over $5o, ooo in there
and more coming in every month.

797
00:59:50,103 --> 00:59:53,266
I'm gonna turn the account over to you
first thing in the morning.

798
00:59:53,439 --> 00:59:54,667
To me?

799
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:58,004
I may be insane to do this,
at least Max thinks so...

800
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,145
...but I want you to spend it all.

801
01:00:00,313 --> 01:00:02,213
If anybody comes in here, feed them.

802
01:00:02,382 --> 01:00:05,545
If they're hungry, don't ask any questions.
Just feed them.

803
01:00:05,718 --> 01:00:08,448
Stay open 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

804
01:00:08,721 --> 01:00:09,745
Oh.

805
01:00:09,922 --> 01:00:12,755
- Oh, Tom, it's the most wonderful thing I...
This is ghastly.

806
01:00:12,925 --> 01:00:17,658
With my brains, my intellect,
my imagination, I make you rich.

807
01:00:17,830 --> 01:00:22,062
And now you throw that good money away
on those lazy moochers.

808
01:00:22,235 --> 01:00:24,601
They're nothing of the sort.
They're honest people.

809
01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:26,762
They paid for it
when they could afford it.

810
01:00:26,939 --> 01:00:29,100
They can afford it now,
every last one of them.

811
01:00:29,275 --> 01:00:32,335
Oh, charity.
It's like a snowball rolling down a hill.

812
01:00:32,512 --> 01:00:34,480
It gets bigger and bigger and bigger.

813
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:36,410
The poor, the needy.

814
01:00:36,582 --> 01:00:38,049
Cancer on civilization.

815
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,684
If I was running the world...

816
01:00:39,852 --> 01:00:43,549
...I would kill everybody
that needed anything.

817
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:45,918
If you were running the world.

818
01:00:58,705 --> 01:01:01,799
You know if there's a fellow around here
named Holmes?

819
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:03,373
Tom Holmes?

820
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:05,602
I'm Tom Holmes.

821
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,170
- Let's go upstairs.
- Oh, why?

822
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:13,080
You haven't done your homework yet.
Come on, I'll help you with your arithmetic.

823
01:01:16,289 --> 01:01:18,314
- What's wrong?
- Not a thing.

824
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:20,755
We thought we'd drop in
and have a little talk.

825
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:22,121
We're from Red Squad.

826
01:01:22,295 --> 01:01:24,388
Red Squad?
We have no Reds around here...

827
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:27,590
Nobody's saying a word to you, brother.

828
01:01:28,835 --> 01:01:31,269
We know you just done five years
for leading a mob...

829
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:33,166
...so we're keeping an eye on you.

830
01:01:33,339 --> 01:01:36,103
We wanna know what you're gonna do
now that you're out.

831
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:38,209
You live in the flat upstairs?

832
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:39,504
Yes, for the time being.

833
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:41,271
Gonna stay in town?

834
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,675
Why, sure.

835
01:01:42,849 --> 01:01:45,977
Okay, but behave yourself and get a job.

836
01:01:46,152 --> 01:01:49,952
The minute you get out of line
and start pulling any of that radical stuff...

837
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,614
...you know what's gonna happen to you,
don't you?

838
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,589
- Yeah.
- What for does he need a job?

839
01:01:54,761 --> 01:01:57,389
He's my partner. He's a rich man.

840
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,856
I'm a rich man too.

841
01:02:02,769 --> 01:02:06,398
Let us know when you're working
and where.

842
01:02:06,572 --> 01:02:11,566
We'll drop in now and then
to see how you're getting along, you know.

843
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:14,745
Cossacks.

844
01:02:15,381 --> 01:02:16,746
Positively an insult.

845
01:02:16,916 --> 01:02:18,349
Swine.

846
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:21,211
Such a beautiful welcome home.

847
01:02:35,134 --> 01:02:37,659
- Is your name Joe Bonocelli?
- Yeah. What do you want?

848
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:39,361
Come on, you're leaving town.

849
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:41,336
Joe! Joe!

850
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:42,667
Joe!

851
01:02:51,117 --> 01:02:53,278
- Your name Antonio Magrustio?
- No.

852
01:02:53,453 --> 01:02:56,547
Don't tell me it isn't, I know you.

853
01:03:01,327 --> 01:03:05,354
- We're running all the Reds out of town.
- What's the matter? I don't do nothing.

854
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:08,022
What are you taking my friend for?
What's the matter?

855
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,862
- We'll take you along too.
- Oh, no.

856
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:12,436
Now, come on. Get in there.
Don't give me any argument.

857
01:03:15,508 --> 01:03:17,339
I didn't have anything to do with that.

858
01:03:17,510 --> 01:03:19,171
- You're a Red, ain't you?
No.

859
01:03:19,345 --> 01:03:22,872
- I suppose our records are all wrong.
- Yes, they are.

860
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,609
- I was just...
- You're just leaving town, and in a hurry.

861
01:03:25,785 --> 01:03:27,878
If you ain't out of here by morning...

862
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:32,718
...you ain't gonna be out of any place
for the next five years.

863
01:03:37,029 --> 01:03:40,521
Gee, I wish you didn't have
to go away again, Daddy.

864
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:42,998
Me too, Bill.

865
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:46,765
Where you going?

866
01:03:46,939 --> 01:03:49,806
What's the difference? I don't know.
I'll write you, Mary.

867
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:53,343
You're sure you won't take
any of that money for yourself?

868
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:58,350
- Just see that Bill is always taken care of.
- Well, you know I'll do that, Tom.

869
01:04:01,387 --> 01:04:03,184
Can I kiss you goodbye, Tom?

870
01:04:03,623 --> 01:04:05,454
I wish you would.

871
01:04:08,628 --> 01:04:11,597
Couldn't you take me
with you this time, Daddy?

872
01:04:45,831 --> 01:04:48,493
Come on, boys, keep moving here.
Come on, get out of here.

873
01:04:48,668 --> 01:04:51,694
There's no jobs here, fellas.
Come on, don't gang up here.

874
01:04:51,871 --> 01:04:54,931
Come on, hurry up.
Keep moving on down there, boys.

875
01:04:55,107 --> 01:04:58,543
Come on, don't block this gate here.
There's no jobs here for you.

876
01:04:58,711 --> 01:05:00,372
Come on, boys, move along.

877
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:42,444
Get in. Get up.
Come on, get up.

878
01:05:42,622 --> 01:05:43,680
Get up.

879
01:05:44,156 --> 01:05:47,125
- Who are you shoving?
- I don't wanna waste a bullet on you.

880
01:05:47,293 --> 01:05:50,353
- No hobos or Reds allowed this state.
- Get out and stay out.

881
01:05:50,529 --> 01:05:52,759
Who you calling Reds?
We're ex-service men.

882
01:05:52,932 --> 01:05:54,058
Maybe, maybe you ain't.

883
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:57,259
Get going and do your explaining
when you cross the state line.

884
01:05:57,436 --> 01:05:58,596
Go on.

885
01:06:17,957 --> 01:06:19,390
Can we come in, buddy?

886
01:06:19,558 --> 01:06:21,082
Well, we meet again.

887
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,888
Sure, come in, come in.
Close the door behind you.

888
01:06:24,063 --> 01:06:26,998
How are you, Red?
Oh, swell.

889
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,432
Sure a tough night.

890
01:06:29,602 --> 01:06:31,627
Yes, it isn't letting up at all.

891
01:06:31,804 --> 01:06:35,262
This fire ain't so much now.
We used up all of our dry wood.

892
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:37,739
Hey, buddy, you got any grub with you?

893
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:38,934
Oh, sure.

894
01:06:39,111 --> 01:06:41,909
Caviar and chicken under glass and...

895
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:51,980
- Roger.
- Tom, Tom Holmes.

896
01:07:06,772 --> 01:07:08,637
Why, you dirty son of a...

897
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:11,299
What's the matter with you?
You gonna be hysterical?

898
01:07:11,477 --> 01:07:13,240
Sit down.

899
01:07:17,483 --> 01:07:23,115
Then the stock market crashed
and, well, we crashed with it.

900
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:27,452
And did you know that your father
was using the depositors' funds?

901
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,218
Sure.

902
01:07:29,595 --> 01:07:31,324
I helped him do it.

903
01:07:31,497 --> 01:07:34,830
It was just one of those things.
When you start, you can't stop.

904
01:07:36,435 --> 01:07:40,132
It takes a lot of courage
to kill yourself like he did.

905
01:07:41,774 --> 01:07:44,004
A lot more than I had.

906
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:46,668
How long did you serve?

907
01:07:47,346 --> 01:07:49,075
Two years.

908
01:07:50,116 --> 01:07:52,311
I topped you there, I got five.

909
01:07:53,052 --> 01:07:55,247
For something I didn't do.

910
01:07:56,288 --> 01:07:59,553
Tom, I... It was a terrible thing I did...

911
01:08:00,259 --> 01:08:01,726
The way I...

912
01:08:01,894 --> 01:08:05,523
The way the old man and I
made you suffer.

913
01:08:06,031 --> 01:08:10,195
And all because of a medal
and a couple of lousy ribbons.

914
01:08:11,637 --> 01:08:13,298
Funny, isn't it?

915
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:17,306
You started way up high
and I started pretty low.

916
01:08:17,877 --> 01:08:20,539
And we end up here in the rain,
together.

917
01:08:23,549 --> 01:08:25,107
Yeah.

918
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:38,129
What do you think of all this?

919
01:08:38,564 --> 01:08:42,432
The country can't go on this way.
It's the end of America.

920
01:08:42,601 --> 01:08:44,068
No.

921
01:08:44,236 --> 01:08:47,069
It may be the end of us,
but it's not the end of America.

922
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:51,406
In a few years,
it'll go on bigger and stronger than ever.

923
01:08:51,577 --> 01:08:55,069
You're the last guy in the world
I'd ever expect to find was an optimist.

924
01:08:55,247 --> 01:08:59,206
That's not optimism,
just common horse sense.

925
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,717
You read President Roosevelt's
inaugural address?

926
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,218
Yeah.

927
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:05,084
He's right.

928
01:09:05,257 --> 01:09:09,489
You know, it takes more than one sock
in the jaw to lick 12o million people.

929
01:09:09,995 --> 01:09:11,895
Here's a bunch of them now, Ed.

930
01:09:12,531 --> 01:09:13,623
Come out here, you guys.

931
01:09:13,799 --> 01:09:17,064
Come on out of there
before I start whaling the tar out of you.

932
01:09:18,137 --> 01:09:20,401
Come on, hurry up, hurry up.

933
01:09:20,706 --> 01:09:24,665
- All right, line up out here. Come on.
- Come on, make it snappy.

934
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,878
These guys the bums
out of that boxcar, Ed?

935
01:09:30,049 --> 01:09:32,882
Let me see, it was plenty dark in there.

936
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:44,794
No, they don't look like they got
gumption enough to fight.

937
01:09:44,964 --> 01:09:46,158
Get over there.

938
01:09:46,332 --> 01:09:49,961
Should we take them downtown?
Dave had the lantern in the boxcar.

939
01:09:50,135 --> 01:09:51,796
It's too far. Besides, I'm tired.

940
01:09:51,971 --> 01:09:54,496
- Come on, let's get going.
- All right, get out of here.

941
01:09:54,673 --> 01:09:56,971
Get out of there. Go on.
Come on.

942
01:09:57,142 --> 01:09:59,235
Get going. Get going.
In the car.

943
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:01,905
Go on, go on.

944
01:10:02,081 --> 01:10:06,177
And keep on walking. And don't stop
if you know what's good for you.

945
01:10:07,586 --> 01:10:09,213
Now where?

946
01:10:13,392 --> 01:10:15,826
Well, anyhow,
we got something to be thankful for.

947
01:10:15,995 --> 01:10:17,360
What?

948
01:10:18,397 --> 01:10:20,456
It stopped raining.

949
01:10:25,271 --> 01:10:28,297
Oh, plenty, yes. Plenty tonight.
Some nice stew.

950
01:10:28,774 --> 01:10:30,605
You lads, a warm cup of coffee.

951
01:10:30,776 --> 01:10:32,767
Oh, Mr. Talbot, I've been looking for you.

952
01:10:32,945 --> 01:10:35,743
You go down there tomorrow,
there's a nice job for you.

953
01:10:42,221 --> 01:10:44,655
When is Dad coming home?

954
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:46,758
I don't know, dear.

955
01:10:46,926 --> 01:10:48,894
He's a wonderful man, isn't he?

956
01:10:49,061 --> 01:10:50,653
The finest.

957
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:53,320
He lives for everyone but himself.

958
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:57,095
He's given everything.

959
01:10:57,303 --> 01:10:59,237
Taken nothing.

960
01:10:59,638 --> 01:11:01,606
You can always be proud of him, Bill.

961
01:11:01,974 --> 01:11:06,673
When I grow up,
I want to be just like my dad.
