00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,180
Captain Yurine will be released from
the position of Captain of the ST.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,180
The transfer will take place in a week.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,700
I wished for the status quo
to last forever, but...

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,920
I thought about the same thing
just before.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,700
Don't shoot!

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,100
<i>Ikeda has been shot.

7
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,920
As for the mysteries of the 'Momotaro'
cases, I did solve them all.

by 'Momotaro.'

11
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,380
The person they're going to
kill next is...

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,120
either Yurine-kun or Akagi-kun.

13
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,400
Now, which do you think they're
going to kill?

This has never happened before.

19
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,980
For them to act well-behaved like this.

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,435
For some reason,
Akagi-san is really motivated.

21
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,852
There are several culprits in these cases.

22
00:01:53,852 --> 00:01:57,020
They act together in a group and repeat the
crimes in accordance with their own rules.

23
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,480
The rule, number one.

24
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,780
Leave an unicursal marking of 'Gobosei'
(Pentagram) where the victim is abducted.

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,080
Rule two. The person who carries out
the murder is different each time.

26
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,410
They're killing one victim per person
by strangulation.

27
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,300
It ensures that every member of
the group carries out a murder.

28
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,940
From the ligature marks on the victims' necks

29
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:16,220
we deducted the physical features of
three members of this group.

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,860
The culprit who killed Kurachi Hisanori is,
175 cm in height and 72 kg in weight.

31
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,440
Izumida Machiko's murderer is rather small.
170 cm in height and 65 kg in weight.

32
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,940
Hatakeyama Rokutaro's murderer has a large
build. 185 cm in height and 90 kg in weight.

33
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,300
Rule three. After the murder, they carve out
the word 'Momotaro' on the back of the victim

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,300
and dump the corpse.

35
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:41,380
These factors show that this group of criminals
is united by one ideology, which is...

36
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,860
social reform.

37
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,860
Kurachi Hisanori, the first victim, was a gym
teacher, and caused the death of his student

38
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,720
by physical punishment, but the high school
never admitted it and he wasn't blamed.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,100
Victim two, Izumida Machiko, forced people
to buy beauty products by fraudulent means

40
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:54,420
and was sued by the customers,
but won the lawsuit.

41
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,345
Finally, Hatakeyama Rokutaro,

42
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:58,779
published a book confessing that he
was the culprit of a murder case

43
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,980
which the statute of limitations had
run out on, and made a fortune.

44
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,580
All of these people are publicly
considered bad.

45
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,760
This group of criminals punishes the villains,
just like 'onitaiji' of 'Momotaro.'

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,240
These are the executions while neglecting
the police and the law.

47
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,100
And rule number four.

48
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,640
At the place where the corpse is discarded

49
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,180
they leave evidence which suggests
the location of the next corpse, on purpose.

50
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,180
What do you think this is implying?

51
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,780
This is provocation against the police,
who are stupid and idiotic!

52
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,080
I've been repeatedly pointing this out, but
none of you ever reconsider your conduct

53
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,640
and that's why we're in this situation!
Shame on you!

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,001
You should be ashamed of yourself!

55
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,520
He's been behaving well in order
to say this to everyone.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,260
Making a speech in front of you people
wears me out. I'm leaving!

57

Our work is finished!
Good job, everyone!

58

Okay, everyone! May I have
your attention, please!

60
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,280
There's another person who
was abducted.

61
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,360
This is Koganei Makoto-san, and the owner of
a restaurant chain called Koganei Holdings.

62
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,360
But, this company has been criticized
as a 'sweat-shop'

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,500
and the other day a class action
lawsuit was filed

64
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,580
by the surviving family members of the
employees, who died from overwork.

65
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:10,920
The court was in favor of Koganei, and it
fueled more criticism for the company.

68

71

72
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:37,560
We've already requested for the
media not to cover this.

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,040
If people get alarmed,
it works in the culprits' favor.

74

criminal group four days ago.

He was already as good as dead. The
question is who will become the fifth victim.

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,100
Akagi-san, what you just said
is inexcusable!

helped when someone was killed?

this time.

97

'The next location is the whole country.'
That's the message, I assume.

It can't be!
That won't be good for a hint!

99

I'm going to ask Aoyama's opinion.

Back to the lab.

101
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:18,960
No matter how he was publicly considered
a villain, I'm sure he had a family as well.

102
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,175
He must have had things
he wanted to do.

103
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:26,970
I said the same thing once before.

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:31,300
But, Akagi-san just discarded me
by saying 'Of course.'

105
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,310
That's very important, isn't it?
Feelings like that for a detective.

106
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,780
Now, could you please let me hear
your opinions or thoughts?

107

I'll bring word to the investigation

112
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,700
Mister?

113
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
They are none of Mr. Yurine's business.

114

- Mister?
- Oh, I see.

115
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,067
He's not our Captain anymore.

116
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,720
I'd say, it depends on the physical
condition of Inspector Ikeda.

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,220
What? Aren't you going to leave?

Please stop creating such an atmosphere
by saying 'it's okay to leave.'

119

I really don't like the state of limbo
we're in, you know?

120
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,600
Because I can't decide whether I should
call you Mister or Captain.

121

Why don't you ask the person in question
what he'd like to be called?

122
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,135
Captain! I'd like to be called Captain,
the same as always!

123
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,283
In that case, Mister it is!
Let's leave it at that.

124
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:30,960
Yes, I think so, too.

125
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,120
<i>[Change from Captain to Mister]

126
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,480
Well then, can I speak up
without reservation?

127
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:39,842
You have permission from... Mister.

128
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,860
Even though the person who carries out
the murder is different each time

129
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,540
these series of crimes are perfectly
'organized' in a fascinating way

130
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,280
and this group is united wholly
as an organization.

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,139
So there may be several people involved

132
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:55,598
but we'll consider that it's
just a single personality right here.

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,390
There are three points to think about.

134
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,900
One, the victims. Two, the evidence.
And three, a contradiction.

135
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,700
A contradiction? What do you mean
by a contradiction?

136
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,920
Mister, you're going too fast! Let's start
with number one, the victims.

137
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,040
The culprits has a clear intention
in selecting the victims.

138
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:14,420
All victims were the people who
never got punished

139
00:08:14,421 --> 00:08:16,800
even though they were
publicly considered bad.

140
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,420
A case similar to this happened in
New York in the 1980's.

141
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,500
<i>A criminal named Bernhard Goetz
attempted to kill four gangs

142
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,880
<i>who had become an object of public
concern, as a punishment.

143
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,480
<i>Goetz was arrested, but the people's
reaction was so simple.

144
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,020
<i>'He did a good job.' 'We don't want you
to give him a heavy sentence.'

145
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,421
Whether reflecting those citizens'
demands or not

146
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,660
he wasn't even accused of the
attempted murder

147
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:42,210
but only convicted of illegal possession
of the handgun.

148
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:47,120
The culprits this time, want the very
demands of citizens.

149
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,100
Once they learned that the police
restrained the media coverage

150
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,920
they made sure to leave the corpse in a way
that would spread throughout the news.

151
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,720
It's pointless if the incident doesn't
come into the light.

152
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,440
In that case, wouldn't it be better if they
left the corpses openly from the beginning?

153
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,200
Bzzz! Stupid! That's a matter of how
much impact it can have, you know?

154
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,460
What if, after the incident comes to light,
they find out that there had been

155
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,620
actually three similar incidents before and
the police didn't make them public?

156
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,740
The police will be openly condemned.

157
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,871
Ding-dong!

158
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:18,961
Next, number two, the evidence.

159
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:22,220
The culprits nonchalantly leave things
which represent themselves

160
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:25,080
such as Gobosei and the carved
seal of 'Momotaro'

161
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,280
and also take the trouble of leaving
a hint for the next crime scene.

162
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,200
It's a so-called theatrical crime.

163
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,960
As Akagi-san said before, this must be
a challenge to the police.

164
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,300
They want to appeal themselves,
who carry out justice, to the public

165
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:43,640
and spread the awareness of how tepid justice
according to the police and the court is.

166
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,560
But for this reason, number three.

167
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,080
A contradiction occurs.

168
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,160
And, that's all so far.

169
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,454
That's all so far?

170
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,500
I think that they have an intense
contradiction, but...

171
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:01,240
I'm sorry.
I can't quite explain it yet.

172
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
After you stirred up like that?

You're so annoying!
Then, I'll tell you this much.

174
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,500
The principal offender of this criminal
group has a suicide wish.

175
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,660
What?

176
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,180
He wants to accomplish his magnificent
goal, but is also willing to die.

177
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,011
I sense that kind of contradiction.

178
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,820
But, I don't even know why
I sense that.

179
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:30,152

Do you know much about the Theory of
Yin-Yang and the Five Elements?

185
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,559
The Theory of Yin-Yang and the

186

Well, I only know a rough outline.

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,500
How much do you know?

188
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,580
The Theory of Yin-Yang and the Five
Elements is based on, namely...

189
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,780
Wood.

190

And Water.

194
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:25,240
And these five elements can be
applied to all things in the world

195
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,440
such as the direction, the colors, and
the internal organs of a human being.

Even from the senses of smell and taste,
to the animals, flowers, nuts and fishes.

197
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,760
And that marking of Gobosei is related
to the Five Elements theory, isn't it?

198
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,160
Yes, it represents the the functions
of the five elements.

199

purpose of murder in the name of justice

You're right.
And that's also a contradiction.

There are two types of people
who investigate murders.

266
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,940
One type, like this man, gets the burning
desire to arrest the criminal

267
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,660
from sympathizing with the
surviving family members.

The other type...

269
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,440
proceeds with the investigation by
imagining how the murderer feels.

270
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,400
I heard that he's been a detective
for over 20 years.

271
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,780
That means, murder has become an
everyday affair for him.

272

What are you saying?

273
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:52,600
Your husband has been troubled with
his job as a detective, hasn't he?

00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:59,970
His mind was exhausted, and
he wanted to quit.

Earlier, you were talking about yourself.

276
00:17:06,676 --> 00:17:12,180
The 'type of person who imagines how
the murderer feels', wasn't it?

277
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,260
What do you think about these culprits?

278
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:18,094
Of course, I can't...

279
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:22,061
forgive them.
And Sekimoto-san told me this.

280
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:26,040
No matter how he was publicly considered
a villain, he must have had a family.

281
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,646
His family must be grieving.

282
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:32,560
But, there are people who were
tormented by those villains.

283
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,440
Don't you think these culprits relieved
them from their suffering?

284
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,836
Akagi-san, I don't like that part of you.

285
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,732
Murder is murder.

286

'He who fights with monsters might take
care lest he thereby become a monster.'

287
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,520
That's the important part.

288
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:56,050
There's no need to solve a mystery by
imagining how the murderer feels.

289
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:06,420
This is such a rare situation,
that I'm actually nervous.

290
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:10,560
Did you notice anything about the suicide
wish of the principal offender?

291
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,240
I don't think I can explain it
well yet.

292
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,186
Is that by any chance...

293
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,320
something you felt as a result of imagining
how the murderer would feel?

294
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,500
Um... that's not quite right.

295
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:30,740
People often misunderstand that the profilers
investigate by imagining how the murderer feels

296
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,740
but it's simply the study of statistics.

297
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,240
So, it feels like, the massive
statistical data inside

298
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:39,740
is pointing to the suicide wish of
the principal offender.

299
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,740
Do you get it?

300
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,120
Akagi-san, you're acting strange.

301
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,220
Profile me.

302
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,600
What?

303
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:55,200
Why am I so obsessive about
solving mysteries?

304
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,990
Is it because I want to find out the feelings
of the monsters who commit murders?

305
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,040
Sorry, but I don't know.

306
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,980
You should talk to Captain about
things like that.

307
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,420
What'll happen to me when he's gone?

308
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,640
It's not like you to say things like that.

309
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,780
But, I'm also worried.

310
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:29,040
It's time for me to be independent
from Captain.

311
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,860
Independent...

312
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,960
Even after the new Captain comes,
we'll have to be the same as before.

313
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,340
Our mental rehabilitation is finally over.

314
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:00,740
I'm sorry for asking you to
come all of a sudden.

315
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,740
Not really.

316
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,220
You came alone as I requested,
didn't you?

317
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,059
Yes.

318
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,360
Oh, where's Captain...
I mean, Mister?

319
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,147
The Director would like to
have a talk with him.

320
00:20:18,147 --> 00:20:21,400
- He should have been back.
- What do you want to talk to him about?

321
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,170
It's about Captain Yurine.

322
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,980
His withdrawal from the ST has
been officially decided.

323
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:36,460
Even though we're right in the
middle of the investigation.

324
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
The higher-ups don't have a clue.

325
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,120
Tell Captain Yurine to contact me.

326
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,257
Someone who's closely related to the crime

327
00:20:49,257 --> 00:20:54,898
should be more careful not to commit
a crime or to become a monster.

328
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,600
It's the same with police officers.

329
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,860
I may become...

330
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,860
Akagi-san won't become a monster.

331
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,120
- How can you be sure?
- I'll make sure to stop you.

332
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,260
So, this really is our farewell, isn't it?

333
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:16,740
I want to say my thanks to Captain.

334
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,990
Say, thank you for taking care
of people like us.

335
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,040
I'm sure that you all feel
the same as me.

336
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,970
As I said before, it's against the rules
to profile your colleagues.

337
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,780
Right. You feel the same too,
Akagi-san, don't you?

338
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,040
- Is everyone assembled here?
- Cap...ster isn't here, though.

339
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,150
- Caster?
- Cas... I mean, Mister. Mister Yurine.

340
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:47,700
Oh. It seems like this series of incidents
didn't just happen recently.

341
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,011
Apparently three months ago

342
00:21:49,011 --> 00:21:53,259
a corpse with the carved seal of 'Momotaro'
was also discovered in Kasukabe, Saitama.

343
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,360
The culprit in this case hasn't
been arrested yet.

344
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,560
Since we're temporarily closed, I can't
guarantee the condition of the coffee beans.

345
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,060
Please.

346
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:06,640
Temporarily closed means, you're
going to open it up again someday?

347
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,120
Did you hear something from Akagi-kun?

348
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,540
Something?

349
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,280
About me.

350
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,340
No, nothing at all.

351
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,060
I see.

352
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,540
Actually, once it had been decided
that I'm to leave the ST

353
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:25,580
Akagi-san doesn't talk much
to me anymore.

354
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,000
He also loses his temper and tells
me to get off the investigation.

355
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:38,140
These cases will be my last, so I want to
be helpful for Akagi-san in the end.

356
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm going to tell you a little bit
about 'Momotaro.'

357
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,010
You're going to cooperate with
our investigation?

358
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,680
Please go ahead.

359
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:55,790
Momotaro was modeled on someone
named Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto.

360
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,500
<i>The official history is that, he came to Okayama,
which was called Kibi-no-kuni back then

361
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:05,740
<i>and fought the people who were committing
crimes, according to the Chronicles of Japan.

362
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,240
But, there are some people who
interpret the story differently.

363
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,240
In what way?

364
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:18,200
Kibitsuhiko-no-mikoto was an aggressor
sent by the Yamato Imperial Court

365
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,200
and no one was committing
crimes in the area.

366
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,120
Momotaro was an aggressor?

367
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,940
History is always written by the winners.

368
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:31,720
There's always a conflict between
good and evil in any age.

369
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,160
Actually, that's not true.

370
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,760
<i>There's always a conflict between
good and good in any age.

371
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,400
<i>Our justice and their justice.

372
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:51,220
<i>It's an old, stale remark, but this is
the very truth I believe in.

373
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,860
<i>[Saegusa Toshiro]

374
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,003
We need to tell this to Captain,
I mean, Mister now!

375
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,940
The person who told me about the story
of Momotaro being an aggressor was

376
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,940
my best friend.

377
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,077
Best friend?

378
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,180
We joined the force in the same year

379
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:15,530
and often had a long talk about
the justice of the police.

380
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:23,060
When justice became our topic, he
always talked about Momotaro.

381
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,441
Where is he now?

382
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:33,740
While I continued working as a detective,
his mind had become exhausted.

383
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,990
In a manner of speaking,
he had become a monster.

384
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,280
The reason I created the ST was to
create a place for Akagi-kun and everyone

385
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:56,360
and also for more people to
believe in the police.

386
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,110
Please take care of Akagi-kun
until the end, Captain.

387
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:05,290
Yes.

388
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,525
This.

389
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:21,779
Akagi-san gave me this before, but
I was too embarrassed to use it.

390
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Not too bad.

391
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,800
Oh. Excuse me, it's from the lab.

392
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:52,000
There's an Episode Zero in this
series of murders.

393
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,480
Three months ago, a corpse with the seal of
'Momotaro was also found in Kasukabe, Saitama.

394
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,500
In Kasukabe?

395
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,840
The victim was Amaki Shinpei,
37 years old.

396
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,860
He was also publicly considered a villain.

397
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,720
Amaki was arrested for suspicion
of rape and murder

398
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,060
but the evidence was denied in trial
and he was acquitted.

399
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:13,040
<i>But right after his release, Amaki committed
another rape and murder.

400
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:16,240
<i>This time, a female police officer was killed.
It was his revenge against the police.

401
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,880
The police persistently investigated,
but Amaki ran away and disappeared.

402
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,940
And three months ago,
he was murdered.

403
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
<i>- What about the culprit?
- Hasn't been arrested yet, but

404
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:28,040
<i>there are many suspicious people.

405
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,660
Most of the detectives who joined the investigation
must have felt the intention to kill Amaki.

406
00:26:31,995 --> 00:26:35,800
And there's one more notable
person among them.

407
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,237
<i>- Who is it?
- It's Saegusa-san.

408
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,776
Saegusa-san and the female
police officer, who Amaki killed

409
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:42,899
joined the force in the same year
and were friends.

410
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,274
And three months ago,
when Amaki was murdered

411
00:26:46,274 --> 00:26:50,700
was the time Saegusa-san left
the police department.

412
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:53,830
I'm leaving the police department.
There is something I want to do.

413
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:58,300
Japan has become an unhealthy country,
even before we knew it.

414
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,800
Where do you think the feelings of someone
who lost their loved one should go?

415
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:09,900
<i>Hey Mister, are you listening?

416
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,540
I'm not done yet. Mister?

417
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,810
Saegusa-san! Saegusa-san!

418
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:18,710
Mister is with Saegusa-san
right now.

419
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:23,380
Mister! Where are you now?

420
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
Mister!

421
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,570
Answer me, Mister!

422
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,410
Mister!

423
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,640
Captain!

424
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,980
Captain, pull yourself together!

425
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Ugh!

426
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,630
<i>Captain, what happened?

427
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,840
Midori, start tracking the GPS
on Captain's cell phone!

428
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,260
Captain! Captain!

429
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,470
He's at Saegusa-san's cafe!

430
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Captain!

431
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:44,900
It's Captain's blood.

432
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,540
Captain is going to be killed, too.

433
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:50,860
I was supposed to be their
next target.

434
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,440
What do you mean by that?

435
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Leave me alone, please.

436
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:09,340
You're Akagi.

437
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:11,260
You can solve the mysteries for sure.

438
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:19,500
It's certain that Saegusa has been contacting
this criminal group and knows their plan.

439
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,860
And he said clearly that the next target
would be either Captain or me.

440
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,855
But, what was the reason?

441
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:29,980
What's their purpose?

442
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,374
What are they thinking?

443
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:41,650
Murder in the name of justice.

444
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Provocation against the police.

445
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:50,310
A suicide wish.

446
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,520
Here we go!

447
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,840
Don't worry. This man used to
be a medical examiner.

448
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
There's no problem with your wound.

449
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,300
I was impressed. You attempted to
shoot me at gunpoint.

450
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
But, I had no intention of
shooting you.

451
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,450
That's him over there?

452
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,098
Yeah.

453
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,440
Sekimoto-san.

454
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,340
It's Yurine from the ST.
Are you alright?

455
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,840
Captain Yurine? Yes!

456
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,420
Saegusa-san, it's too bad.

457
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,740
The mysteries are all solved.

458
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,733
I'm going there right now to
tell you everything.

459
00:31:19,733 --> 00:31:21,860
So, will you please tell me
where you are?

460
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,660
And I'm coming alone.

461
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,320
I guess it'll be about 20 minutes
before Akagi gets here.

462
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,470
Then, let's finish what we
need to do before that.

463
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,280
It's 'Onitaiji' by 'Momotaro.'

464
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,660
What I'm about to tell you is, the mind of the
principal offender of this criminal group.

465
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,072
If the victim of the first murder by the
principal offender was Amaki Shinpei

466
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,778
the motive was perhaps revenge.

467
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,060
He found the monster named Amaki, who was
released into the wild, 15 years later

468
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,760
and brought down the hammer of justice.

469
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,460
But, it was still murder.

470
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:00,280
So, he wanted to justify his own actions.

471
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,100
And, he assembled his friends
with the same ambitions

472
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,860
and started executing other villains in the name
of justice, but couldn't hold back anymore.

473
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,900
That's what happened in this series
of crimes in the past week.

474
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,600
And, I don't want to you to be surprised

475
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,990
but one of the candidates for the principal
offender of Amaki's murder, is Counselor Saegusa.

476
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:27,880
He's a villain. Kill him.

477
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,866
A villain?

478
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,300
What you told me was that, there's no
difference between good and evil in this world.

479
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,940
Didn't you make up your
mind to join us?

480
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
Then, you can do it.

481
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,871
Saegusa-san, don't!

482
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,639
I have no idea what's going on,
but don't do it anyway!

483
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:01,334
Sekimoto Yuzo, the First Investigation
Division of the Saitama police.

484
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,900
15 years ago, when he was still a rookie
detective, he made a huge mistake.

485
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,560
In order to arrest a murder suspect,
he fabricated evidence.

486
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:19,780
As a result, the court ruled that all evidence
lacked credibility and acquitted the suspect.

487
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:24,920
And a few days later, that suspect
killed a female police officer.

488
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,620
That's about the rape and
murder case...

489
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,800
It's all this man's fault that
Amaki Shinpei was left at large.

490
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,440
Now, the time has come!

491
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,741
I will carry out justice.

492
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:50,493
He is the one...

493
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,110
who killed Seiko.

494
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,110
Saegusa-san!

495
00:34:13,130 --> 00:34:15,130
Saegusa-san!

496
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,671
Indeed, it has been said that Saegusa-san

497
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:22,160
and Yoshimura Seiko, the female police
officer who Amaki killed

498
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,620
joined the force in the same year and
were very close to each other.

499
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:30,520
But, we're doubting the theory that
Saegusa-san is the culprit of this murder.

500
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,806
After killing Yoshimura Seiko,
Amaki was nowhere to be found

501
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:36,218
even though the police put their
prestige in the investigation.

502
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,540
Who can find that kind of person?

503
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,160
Do you think an ordinary person has
the ability to investigate like that?

504
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,500
No!

505
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:45,960
No matter what someone says, you guys are
detectives even in your own stupid way, aren't you?

506
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,300
Different from the general public.

507
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:52,320
Then, what kind of person was
able to find Amaki?

508
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,520
A former detective.

509
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,601
Someone who used to be an
excellent detective

510
00:34:56,601 --> 00:35:00,820
quit his job right
after Yoshimura Seiko was killed

511
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:05,420
and got obsessed with finding Amaki,
then eventually found and killed him

512
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,160
and got his revenge.

513
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,820
Wait a minute.

514
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:11,780
It was only three months ago when
Counselor Saegusa left the police department.

515
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:16,140
Until then, he was at a busy post and it would've
been difficult to track Amaki's whereabouts.

516
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:17,640
You're correct.

517
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:21,840
So, when we searched for the people who
were close to Yoshimura Seiko-san in the list...

518
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,280
Hey, Presto!

519
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,410
There was one detective who resigned
right after Amaki had disappeared.

520
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,083
Yuhara Keita.

521
00:35:30,083 --> 00:35:33,159
He joined the force in the same year
as Counselor Saegusa.

522
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,644
The principal offender of this series
of crimes is... Yuhara.

523
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,160
Yuhara?

524
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,277
What's the matter, Saegusa?
Make up your mind.

525
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,852
Stop this nonsense.

526
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:52,380
What you said about him fabricating
evidence is a lie.

527
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:59,970
You're not serious about
killing him, either.

528
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:06,520
This gun is too light.
There's no bullet inside.

529
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,980
As expected of you.

530
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,860
Instead, he's a member of your
group, isn't he?

531
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,556
You tested me, didn't you?

532
00:36:27,556 --> 00:36:31,940
No. I just bet on the slightest possibility.

533
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,400
I couldn't believe you no
matter how hard I tried.

534
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:42,120
I wish you would have pulled the
trigger without arguing.

535
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:50,580
Sekimoto-san, why?

536
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:54,500
You'll eventually understand, if you
continue investigating the murderers.

537
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,180
Since when did you notice
our activities?

538
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,840
You must have gotten an inkling
after Amaki was killed.

539
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,960
That's why you left the
police department.

540
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,740
And you waited for me to contact you.

541
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,480
Why did you leave the police department?

542
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,620
The same as you, Yuhara.

543
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,366
I can't forgive him.

544
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,980
There is a limit to what the police can do.

545
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:30,000
But, the true evil lies beyond
that limit.

546
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,500
I want to create... another justice.

547
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:43,480
Do you remember what I told you
about 'Momotaro'?

548
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,610
Yeah.

549
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:50,340
Yuhara's ambition is to punish the
evil in place of the police.

550
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,449
And the comrades who gathered
around him

551
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,640
must have all grown tired of the
existence of the police itself.

552
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,520
For example, some like Samejima, who
used to be with the Saitama police.

553
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,920
I'm sure you all can understand
very well.

554
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,620
When you make the murder investigation your
daily work, anyone can get a weakened heart.

555
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,280
But, the devil plays on your
weakness right then.

556
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,440
The devil I'm talking about is the
concept of justice.

557
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,620
The detective with a weakened heart
lowers the stake of murder

558
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:20,740
and he would do anything for the
sake of justice he believes in.

559
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:23,840
Even though he is a police officer,
he also becomes a murderer.

560
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,659
For the nobler purpose of 'onitaiji'
he becomes Momotaro

561
00:38:27,659 --> 00:38:30,700
who assembles his friends and goes out
of his way to invade the enemy's territory.

562
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,331
Look at this.

563
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,760
When you connect the locations where
they left the corpses on the map...

564
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,320
Don't you think they look alike?

565
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,920
Establishing another police organization
is what Yuhara intends to do.

566
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,180
Wait... Wait for a minute!

567
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,000
I almost ignored it, but didn't you say
Momotaro was an invader just before?

568
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,700
Yes, I did.

569
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,280
What are you talking about?

570
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,913
It's just one of various theories

571
00:39:01,914 --> 00:39:05,179
and an anecdote, which has been
handed down to the local people in Okayama.

572
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Did everyone know?

573
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,320
Why don't you all know this?

574
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,840
Are you stupid? It's a matter of
common knowledge! Shame on you!

575
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Get out of here now!

576
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,610
I just pretended to be Akagi-san.

577
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,180
I wanted to do this once.

578
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,740
That's what the culprit intends to do!

579
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:31,580
Thinking from a different angle! Turning
the sense of values upside down!

580
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,220
Momotaro, who has been regarded as a
good person, actually was not a good person!

581
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,339
Give me a detailed explanation.

582
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,420
I've been wondering the whole time.

583
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,820
I felt that this culprit wasn't
consistent with himself.

584
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:43,676
You're talking about the suicide wish.

585
00:39:43,676 --> 00:39:46,340
The culprits have been challenging the
police by leaving many hints.

586
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,970
They have no intention of losing, and
want to finish with the perfect victory.

587
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:53,400
And I thought it contradicted
with the suicide wish

588
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,720
but, it really doesn't contract at all!

589
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:59,020
There's just one way not to get caught
by the police, his enemy, forever.

590
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
And that's suicide.

591
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:04,360
By doing so, the culprits will become
eternal beings.

592
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,760
They'll be the gods of citizens, who denounce
the police and sing the praises of the culprits!

593
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:15,540
And everyone realizes that
evil always gets destroyed.

594
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:19,320
For this world where the police and the law
can't beat the evil people anymore...

595
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
For this world where evil prevails...

596
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,700
And for the exhausted general public

597
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,980
they're going to make a paradigm shift and
turn the sense of values upside down.

598
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,260
Evil always gets destroyed.

599
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:36,450
They'll learn that it's okay to destroy evil
themselves, without relying on the police.

600
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:39,990
<i>- [Let's follow Momotaro!]
- [We're going to continue the chain of justice!]

601
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:42,220
<i>- [We can't leave justice to the police!]
- [Where should we start?] 

602
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,840
Weren't you going to stop us after becoming
a member of our group?

603
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:51,180
It's too bad. I knew you were lying
from the very beginning.

604
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,900
That's why we've done all the crimes
without you.

605
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:58,280
And I also made good use of you.

606
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,940
Thanks to you,
I was able to provoke Akagi Samon.

607
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,900
The person they're going to
kill next is...

608
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:09,986
either Yurine-kun or Akagi-kun.

609
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,257
Now, which do you think
they're going to kill?

610
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:19,996
<i>[Akagi: The next target is Captain.
The reason is Gobosei.]

611
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,069
That's what happened.

612
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:32,092
Now you know that...

613
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:39,520
my brain is better than anyone else's.

614
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,253
Of course, better than him, too.

615
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,080
Let's hear the answer.

616
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,511
Which of you are we going to
kill next, you or him?

617
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,930
It'll be Captain.

618
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,620
If Captain gets killed,
I'll never forgive you.

619
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,540
I'll get my revenge no matter what.
I'll make you pay the same price.

620
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,840
I'll kill you.
I will definitely kill you.

621
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,040
You're reading my moves that far.

622
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,760
And you don't care about dying
if I'm killing you.

623
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,460
It's your suicide wish,
in a manner of speaking.

624
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:30,400
When you die,
you'll become a god.

625
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,040
A god who won the police.
An eternal being.

626
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,140
On the other hand,
I'll be arrested for murder

627
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:37,960
and I won't be able to solve any mysteries,
to reason or to investigate ever again.

628
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,600
There'll be no one to stop
your organization.

629
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,849
That's the best scenario you've written.

630
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,719
This is the answer to the mystery.

631
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:01,060
You lose, Akagi Samon.

632
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,500
Your reasoning is all wrong.

633
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,973
I just wrote here the answer
to the mystery.

634
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:21,543
Now.

635
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,100
Kill me!

636
00:43:24,100 --> 00:43:26,100
Kill me, then cut up my stomach
and take the answer out!

637
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:29,540
- It must be so easy for a doctor!
- Stop doing such a foolish thing, Yuhara!

638
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:31,860
The police have changed.

639
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,860
They're different from how you
were back then!

640
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,160
They can carry out justice now.
They have become stronger!

641
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,380
No, they haven't!

642
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,960
That's why I created the ST.

643
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:43,607
There are no mysteries they can't solve!

644
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,918
Yes.

645
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,940
That's my point, Saegusa.

646
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:54,800
I've been always watching ever
since the ST was formed.

647
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,820
Akagi Samon.

648
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:02,659
You get weirdly obsessive about
solving a mystery.

649
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:08,065
It's too bad!
The mysteries are all solved now!

650
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,708
The mysteries are all solved now!

651
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:23,500
That's because you want to find out the
feelings of the monster who commits murders.

652
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,360
But, you couldn't solve the mystery
this time. Why?

653
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:34,324
That's because you can't understand the
feelings of a murderer if you haven't killed anyone.

654
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:39,996
Once you kill someone, you'll be able
to solve the mystery.

655
00:44:43,300 --> 00:44:44,800
Don't!

656
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,360
Akagi-san, don't shoot!

657
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,800
As I told you before,
murder is murder!

658
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,680
We just took care of the villains!
And you'll still deny us?

659
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,904
Of course!

660
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:55,979
What you've been doing are the serial
murders committed as an organization!

661
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,640
You must be arrested and
judged by law.

662
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,640
That's an old-fashioned sense of justice.

663
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,040
And let me tell you this.

664
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,900
The reason Akagi-san obsesses over solving a
mystery is because he wants to be helpful to others.

665
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:11,920
Akagi-san knows that everyone becomes happy
if he solves a mystery and settles the case.

666
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,500
And so, you shouldn't nonsensically conclude
he wants to find out the feelings of the murderer!

667
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,840
It's you who's all wrong!

668
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:22,280
Akagi-san is not a monster!
He's only a human.

669
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:27,744
He's my important friend!
My very best friend in the history of me!

670
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:56,900
If you don't hurry up,
your friend is going to die.

671
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,700
Stop, Yuhara!

672
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:01,780
I'm sure that these two will be able to
get to the person who let Amaki run loose!

673
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,200
They can settle old scores for Seiko!

674
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:08,460
Let's entrust these two with
what we couldn't do!

675
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,860
Akagi-kun will never forgive someone
who would solve a mystery

676
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,400
by taking it so far as to
forge evidence.

677
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
That's why I bet on you.

678
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:37,460
What a shame!

679
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:44,254
The mysteries are... all...
solved now!

680
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:54,640
I did solve all the mysteries,
you mean-spirited bugger!

681
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,820
The person you want to kill is neither
me nor Captain!

682
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,580
It's yourself!

683
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:03,740
And it'll have to be me who kills you!

684
00:47:05,530 --> 00:47:10,700
You want me to get a taste for killing
someone, don't you?

685
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:13,480
You couldn't hold back anymore after
killing Amaki Shinpei.

686
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:17,500
You sought out comrades and made them
understand the feelings of a murderer one by one.

687
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,160
And finally it's my turn.

688
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,160
You thought, I wouldn't be able to hold
back anymore once I killed you.

689
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:27,320
And you hoped for me to continue killing for
justice by leading these men from now on

690
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,000
while succeeding the last wish of yours.

691
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:33,440
But, you're misunderstanding me.

692
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,440
It's too bad.

693
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:38,300
I have no interest in the feelings
of a murderer.

694
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:41,140
I just...

695
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:43,940
It was just as Captain said.

696
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:47,460
Solving a mystery is the only way for me
to get recognized by everyone.

697
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,400
Solving a mystery is the only way for
me to relate to society.

698
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,220
I have anthropophobia, a dirty mouth,
and a rotten personality.

699
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,000
So, I have to solve a mystery in order
to become helpful to others.

700
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Thank you, Captain.

701
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:05,369
I was able to finally figure it out,
because you were there.

702
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,660
The carved seal of 'Momotaro' is

703
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,580
to send a message that there is only good
in this world, not the good and the bad.

704
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:14,611
It's so ridiculous that it
makes me vomit!

705
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,240
You're wrong!

706
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:19,560
Times may change,
and society may change

707
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,540
or even the law may get distorted and the
interpretation of the Constitution may change

708
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,240
but killing someone is absolutely bad.

709
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,100
A human killing another human
should never be forgiven!

710
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:33,080
There's no existence value in such a thing!

711
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:38,040
The last remaining mystery.

712
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,970
Why do you want to die?

713
00:48:42,374 --> 00:48:45,776
I finally understood the meaning of what
you said at that time.

714
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:49,980
Akagi-kun will never forgive someone
who would solve a mystery

715
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:52,060
by taking it so far as to
forge evidence.

716
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:58,760
You were telling me to find the detective who
fabricated evidence in order to arrest Amaki.

717
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,145
You entrusted me with the person
Yuhara hated the most

718
00:49:01,145 --> 00:49:05,139
since you wouldn't be able to
search by yourself.

719
00:49:06,230 --> 00:49:08,699
You won your bet, Saegusa-san.

720
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,860
The detective who fabricated
evidence was...

721
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,860
you.

722
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:23,240
Your upper eyelid lifted and
lower eyelid got stiff.

723
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:25,640
Your lips are twitching sideways.
That's the expression of fear.

724
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:29,480
Are you scared of me hitting
every mark that much?

725
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:34,020
Because you fabricated evidence, Amaki
was acquitted and Yoshimura Seiko was killed.

726
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,880
And that's why you can't forgive yourself.

727
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,280
Even after killing Amaki Shinpei, your
feelings of guilt didn't go away.

728
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,160
And that's why you couldn't
hold back anymore.

729
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,160
Because you wanted someone to stop
you from going out of control

730
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,360
you left the marking of Gobosei,
carved out 'Momotaro'

731
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,338
suggested the next crime scene, and
provoked me using Saegusa-san.

732
00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:51,300
That's the answer!
Perfect solution!

733
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,276
I'm not going to hear
your objection.

734
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,954
Don't shoot! Don't kill anyone!

735
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,343
Capture them!

736
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,460
Captain!

737
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:27,400
Captain! Captain!

738
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,620
Captain!

739
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,020
Hang in there! Captain!

740
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,155
- Yuhara! Yuhara!
- Let me go!

741
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,860
You're wrong!

742
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,940
Akagi-san.

743
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:57,020
Until the very end...

744
00:50:59,090 --> 00:51:01,370
I'm useless...

745
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:05,060
And I couldn't even return a favor.

746
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,220
I'm sorry.

747
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:12,240
But...

748
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,770
Aoyama-san.

749
00:51:15,650 --> 00:51:17,204
Midori-san.

750
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:21,032
Kurosaki-san.

751
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:24,403
Yamabuki-san.

752
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,086
And Akagi-san.

753
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:32,242
I'm glad I met all of you.

754
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:34,720
Thank you very much.

755
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:40,590
It's been fun.

756
00:51:48,070 --> 00:51:49,993
Captain!

757
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:52,940
Captain!

758
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,170
Captain!

759
00:51:56,910 --> 00:51:59,970
This is just a skin-deep wound.

760
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:02,340
Huh?

761
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,140
Are you kidding?
You're not going to die!

762
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,480
Ouch! It hurts!

763
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:09,520
- Of course! Pull yourself together!
- Akagi-san, you're hurting me!

764
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,316
- Get on your feet! Now!
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

765
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:15,960
- It hurts! It hurts!
- Of course!

766
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,990
- I thought I was going to die.
- I'm so sorry. He's alright.

767
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:23,395
I'm sorry for having troubled you.
Ouch! Ouch!

768
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:24,453
Akagi-kun, what about this?

769
00:52:24,453 --> 00:52:25,980
- Now walk!
- Ouch! Ouch!

770
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,980
Akagi-san, for a skin-deep wound...

771
00:52:34,550 --> 00:52:36,550
<i>The case was over.

772
00:52:37,560 --> 00:52:44,140
<i>Even Director Matsudo wasn't aware of what
Saegusa-san was doing for the last three months.

773
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,620
The higher-ups told me.

774
00:52:46,620 --> 00:52:49,986
You pretended to have left the
police department.

775
00:52:50,510 --> 00:52:54,980
I didn't mean to pretend, but...

776
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:59,080
So, I guess it was an
undercover investigation?

777
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:03,560
I still can't believe it.

778
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:04,800
This was an extraordinary situation.

779
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,060
We were fretting that bad.

780
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,060
Both the higher-ups and I.

781
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,270
I'm sorry for having troubled you.

782
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:16,540
I'm sure you had many troubles
taking care of the ST.

783
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:19,983
Not at all.

784
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:23,520
Since I was in succession to
someone I respect.

785
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,120
Me, too.

786
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:33,560
If my successor wasn't you, I would have
stayed the guardian of the ST.

787
00:53:34,710 --> 00:53:37,100
I couldn't have gone after Yuhara.

788
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:44,540
Justice may not be something
you carry out selfishly

789
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,920
but something you share with
and support each other with.

790
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:52,320
Yes.

791
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:57,587
I wish I could have made him
realized that sooner.

792
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:01,220
What's that?
Are you trying to be funny?

793
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,220
<i>[Ikeda Sosuke]

794
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:06,820
You guys are such good friends,
aren't you?

795
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:08,820
I can't wait for Akagi-san to see this.

796
00:54:14,290 --> 00:54:17,180
Akagi-san will go mad in jealousy,
he says.

797
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,800
Since they're in matching outfits.

798
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,120
Your wound was just a scratch.
That's exaggerating!

799
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,780
I'm sorry.

800
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:30,620
It's all thanks to you, Captain.
I'm extremely grateful.

801
00:54:30,620 --> 00:54:33,620
I don't know why, but it doesn't bother me
anymore even when Captain put restraint on me.

802
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:36,920
This is amazing!
I've been transformed.

803
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:38,920
What am I supposed to say
at a time like this?

804
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,100
It would be 'Thank you'.

805
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,460
Was it?

806
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,470
The more you express words
of appreciation

807
00:54:44,471 --> 00:54:46,480
the higher your happiness index
will become.

808
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,660
I did some research.

809
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,973
It made me feel happy, indeed.

810
00:54:51,074 --> 00:54:54,320
I heard that they produce pleasure chemicals.

811
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:56,320
So, I'm going to say it.

812
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,946
Captain, thanks.

813
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,820
If Captain wasn't here, it would've been
pointless for us to form the ST.

814
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:08,880
And because Captain was here, we
thought we were fine like this.

815
00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:18,300
'Not at all.'

816
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:22,420
'I'm the one who's been receiving favors
from Aoyama-san and everyone

817
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,780
and I'm grateful for that.
Thank you very much.'

818
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,260
Speech like that won't be necessary.
We all know that.

819
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:29,740
You're welcome.

820
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,420
You're welcome.

821
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,740
You're welcome.

822
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:39,680
All of you, just can't be honest
about it, can you?

823
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,020
Thank you.

824
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,540
Honest! Kurosaki-san is the most
honest person here!

825
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,480
Huh? Are you crying?

826
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:51,600
I'm not.

827
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:54,960
- I'm not crying.
- Aren't those so-called tears in your eyes?

828
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:57,420
Yes, I guess they're probably tears. Yes.

829
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,440
- That's so gross.
- Why do you say that?

830
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,140
Your eyes are all red.

831
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:03,840
My eyes are all red?
Of course, from my tears.

832
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:09,986
- Oh, Kikukawa-san?
- Are those for Yurine-kun?

833
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:16,162
Aren't you going to say good-bye?

834
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:20,360
Don't be rustic and clumsy to hinder his
farewell with friends, you know?

835
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,160
Now, that's it for your farewell party!

836
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,120
What? Was this my farewell party?

837
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:36,120
Good job, you can leave now.

838
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:39,260
Was it, the Countermeasures Office against
Special Crimes? Do your best, I guess.

839
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:41,840
To the point you don't die on duty.

840
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,100
- Everyone, listen to me!
- Ah, how long are you staying?

841
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:49,993
We got to say our good-bye nicely,
so why don't you just leave?

842
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,480
Be a man,
or we'll be disappointed in you.

843
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,500
Like I said before, I belong to the ST
for four more days.

844
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,540
Until then, I'm the Captain here!
You're all going too fast!

845
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:02,272
And also, I haven't said good-bye
to Akagi-san yet.

846
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,040
Is this Akagi-san?

847
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,779
Everyone's giving me a hard time!
Please hurry!

848
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,730
Huh? Who am I?

849
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,351
It's me! Captain!

850
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:17,960
<i>It was the next day.

851
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:22,769
Go in.

852
00:57:22,769 --> 00:57:25,180
<i>Akagi-san was arrested.

853
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,750
<i>As a suspect for the murder case.

854
00:57:39,736 --> 00:57:44,703
