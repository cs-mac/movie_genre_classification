ENGLAND 1554

2
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,703
HENRY VIII IS DEAD

3
00:01:12,788 --> 00:01:14,664
THE COUNTRY IS DIVIDED...

4
00:01:14,957 --> 00:01:16,249
... IN CATHOLICS ANd PROTESTANTS

5
00:01:16,792 --> 00:01:20,670
HENRY'S OLDEST DOCHTER MARY,
A DEVOUT CATHOLIC, IS QUEEN

6
00:01:21,171 --> 00:01:23,256
SHE IS WITHOUT CHILDREN

7
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:28,719
THE GREATEST FEAR OF THE CATHOLICS IS THAT SHE
WILL BE SUCCEEDED BY HER PROTESTANT HALF-SISTER

8
00:01:35,518 --> 00:01:36,727
I praise the LORD

9
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:41,167
and so shall be saved
from mine enemies !

10
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,304
The waves of death
have closed about me !

11
00:01:47,181 --> 00:01:50,799
The cords of hell
have encompassed me about

12
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:55,392
and the snares of death
have overtaken me !

13
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:59,190
The cords of hell
have encompassed me about

14
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:04,319
and the snares of death
have overtaken me !

15
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:10,816
In my tribulation I call to the Lord
and cry to my God

16
00:02:10,953 --> 00:02:15,032
and He heard my voice
cry out His temple ... !

17
00:02:15,124 --> 00:02:17,579
Move back ! Clear the way !

18
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:19,957
Move back !

19
00:02:22,339 --> 00:02:24,378
Keep in line, woman !

20
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:35,841
By order of their gracious Majesties,
Queen Mary and King Philip,

21
00:02:35,936 --> 00:02:40,846
we are come to witness the burning
of these Protestant heretics

22
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:46,147
who have denied the authority
of the one true Catholic church

23
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:49,107
and of His Holiness the Pope.

24
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:55,401
Let them burn for all eternity
in the flames of hell.

25
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:06,334
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:12,213
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

27
00:03:13,513 --> 00:03:18,933
Benedicat te Omnipotens Deus Pater,
Filius et Spiritus Sanctus.

28
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:21,140
God bless you, Master Ridley !

29
00:03:21,229 --> 00:03:25,143
For the love of God, friends, help me !
I burn too slowly !

30
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:30,607
Help them !
For God's sake, help them !

31
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,626
Your Grace, the Queen is with child.

32
00:04:36,717 --> 00:04:41,509
They should've consulted me
before they rang the bells.

33
00:04:45,225 --> 00:04:47,264
Is it true ?

34
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:52,808
She has ceased to bleed, her breasts have
some milk, and her stomach is swollen.

35
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,227
Is it true ?

36
00:04:54,317 --> 00:04:58,777
The King has not shared her bed
for many months.

37
00:04:58,863 --> 00:05:02,942
He has a repugnance for it,
as lately Your Grace has for mine.

38
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:24,885
Norfolk...

39
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,174
Your Majesties,
this is most wondrous news.

40
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,761
Indeed.

41
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:35,430
We do thank God for this,
our most happy condition.

42
00:05:35,523 --> 00:05:38,060
We must also thank His Majesty
for this event

43
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,640
which is nothing short of a miracle.

44
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:48,616
What news, my Lords,
of the rebellion against our authority ?

45
00:05:49,703 --> 00:05:51,327
Sussex ?

46
00:05:51,413 --> 00:05:54,828
Madam, it is safely dispatched,
thanks to His Grace.

47
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:58,830
Sir Thomas Wyatt and the other leaders
are already dealt with.

48
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,999
If they had succeeded,
these Protestants and heretics

49
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:05,166
meant to place your sister

50
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,381
upon the throne.

51
00:06:08,888 --> 00:06:12,387
There is no proof
against the Lady Elizabeth.

52
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:16,008
- She is plainly guilty.
- What need is there of proof ?

53
00:06:16,103 --> 00:06:19,187
If she remains alive,
there will be plots to raise her

54
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:20,980
to the throne.

55
00:06:21,066 --> 00:06:22,061
Ambassador ?

56
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:28,402
I agree with His Grace.

57
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,736
She is a heretic.
She must never be allowed to succeed.

58
00:06:32,827 --> 00:06:34,155
But if she...

59
00:06:35,246 --> 00:06:38,199
If she were brought properly to trial,

60
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,912
she would not be found guilty,

61
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:43,872
and we would be condemned.
She has friends in Parliament.

62
00:06:43,963 --> 00:06:47,627
My sister was born
of that whore Anne Boleyn !

63
00:06:47,716 --> 00:06:51,630
She was born a bastard !
She will never rule England !

64
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:04,642
Your Grace will find some proof
of her treachery. I am most sure of it.

65
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:47,646
It was so fast !

66
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:04,535
May I join you, my Lady ?

67
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,795
If it please you, sir.

68
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:34,200
My Lady !

69
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,701
My Lady !

70
00:09:46,136 --> 00:09:47,760
Princess Elizabeth !

71
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,398
Princess Elizabeth !

72
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,778
You are accused of conspiring
with Sir Thomas Wyatt

73
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:17,540
against Her Sovereign Majesty

74
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:20,293
and are arrested for treason.

75
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:25,962
I am commanded to take you hence
from this place... to the Tower.

76
00:10:39,436 --> 00:10:41,475
Remember who you are.

77
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:52,444
Do not be afraid of them.

78
00:10:56,828 --> 00:10:58,867
My Lady.

79
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:40,948
Prisoner to the steps.

80
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:52,625
I cannot confess to something
I did not do.

81
00:11:52,714 --> 00:11:54,124
Your denials are in vain.

82
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:58,545
You knew of the rebellion, Madam.
It is plain enough.

83
00:11:58,636 --> 00:12:00,379
Where is your proof ?

84
00:12:00,472 --> 00:12:02,594
It was to your advantage.

85
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:04,721
You must let me see the Queen...

86
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,058
You despise the Queen,
and the Catholic faith.

87
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,567
I am a true and faithful subject.

88
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,448
I attend Mass...

89
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,071
You pretend ! But in your heart...

90
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,988
What's that ? What say you, Madam ?

91
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,791
Speak up !

92
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,170
Madam, if there is some small truth
in these charges,

93
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,874
however innocently or unknowingly
you did proceed,

94
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,007
you had best confess.

95
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,838
I ask you

96
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:49,757
why we must tear ourselves apart
for this small question of religion.

97
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,927
Catholic, Protestant... !

98
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,969
You think it small,
though it killed your mother !

99
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,699
We all...

100
00:13:09,871 --> 00:13:12,540
We all believe in God, my Lords.

101
00:13:12,623 --> 00:13:16,572
No, Madam,
there is only one true belief.

102
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,827
The other - heresy.

103
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,779
Madam, you are cold.

104
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:52,404
I do not need your pity.

105
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,695
Accept it, then,

106
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:56,365
for my sake.

107
00:13:59,793 --> 00:14:01,619
Thank you.

108
00:14:02,754 --> 00:14:05,423
I shall not forget this kindness.

109
00:15:17,325 --> 00:15:19,566
Tonight I think I die.

110
00:15:26,751 --> 00:15:28,790
Madam.

111
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:33,290
No... !

112
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:48,265
Save me ! Save me !

113
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:26,094
I am Your Majesty's most humble servant.

114
00:16:42,031 --> 00:16:43,904
Come here.

115
00:16:45,117 --> 00:16:47,786
Closer, so I might see your face.

116
00:16:55,668 --> 00:16:59,167
When I look at you
I see nothing of the King.

117
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:02,172
Only that whore - your mother.

118
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:09,425
My father never did anything so well
as to cut off her head.

119
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:12,634
Your Majesty forgets
he was also my father.

120
00:17:16,021 --> 00:17:19,852
Why will you not confess
your crimes against me ?

121
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:23,190
Because, Your Majesty,
I have committed none.

122
00:17:25,697 --> 00:17:28,366
You speak with such sincerity !

123
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:32,317
I see you are still a consummate actress.

124
00:17:34,747 --> 00:17:37,035
My husband is gone.

125
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:39,793
They have poisoned my child.

126
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:43,667
They say it is a tumour.

127
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:47,421
Madam, you are not well.

128
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:51,636
They say this cancer
will make you Queen, but they are wrong !

129
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:56,182
Look there ! It is your death warrant.
All I need do is sign it.

130
00:17:56,268 --> 00:18:01,724
Mary, if you sign that paper,
you will be murdering your own sister.

131
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:10,114
You will promise me something ?

132
00:18:12,617 --> 00:18:16,744
When I am gone, you will
do everything in your power

133
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,154
to uphold the Catholic faith.

134
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:25,451
Do not take away from the people
the consolations of the Blessed Virgin.

135
00:18:28,715 --> 00:18:30,754
When I am Queen

136
00:18:31,301 --> 00:18:33,340
I promise

137
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:38,925
to act as my conscience dictates.

138
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:43,844
Well, do not think to be Queen at all.

139
00:18:43,938 --> 00:18:47,271
You may return to your house at Hatfield,

140
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:50,773
but you will remain under arrest
until I am recovered.

141
00:18:52,613 --> 00:18:54,652
Thank you, Your Majesty.

142
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,150
No...

143
00:18:56,241 --> 00:19:01,317
Feed her to the wolves.
Let her see what they are like.

144
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:52,042
She is just a child,
and yet still you piss yourselves !

145
00:19:55,464 --> 00:19:58,583
Your Grace,
Protestants are returning from abroad.

146
00:19:58,676 --> 00:20:03,836
Yes, and have made plans to massacre
every Catholic in England.

147
00:20:04,264 --> 00:20:08,510
There would be butchery indeed
if such a plan were even conceivable.

148
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:10,974
They say Walsingham
will return from France.

149
00:20:11,062 --> 00:20:13,101
Walsingham is nothing !

150
00:20:20,613 --> 00:20:22,819
Be sure he does not.

151
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:27,734
There is so little beauty in this world,
and so much suffering.

152
00:20:29,705 --> 00:20:32,789
Do you suppose
that is what God had in mind ?

153
00:20:33,917 --> 00:20:36,787
That is to say, if there is a God at all.

154
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:42,213
Perhaps there is nothing
in this universe but ourselves

155
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:45,257
and our thoughts.

156
00:20:52,727 --> 00:20:54,766
Think before you do this.

157
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:06,853
If you must do it,

158
00:21:06,949 --> 00:21:08,988
then do it now.

159
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,490
And without regret.

160
00:21:12,579 --> 00:21:14,737
But first think carefully

161
00:21:18,251 --> 00:21:20,290
and be certain

162
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:22,501
why it needs to be done.

163
00:21:29,929 --> 00:21:31,968
Come here.

164
00:21:42,566 --> 00:21:44,605
Look out there.

165
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,530
There is a whole world waiting for you.

166
00:21:50,532 --> 00:21:54,659
Innocence
is the most precious thing you possess.

167
00:21:55,578 --> 00:21:58,662
Lose that and you lose your soul.

168
00:22:14,429 --> 00:22:15,887
..et Spiritus Sancti...

169
00:22:15,973 --> 00:22:17,087
Amen.

170
00:22:17,182 --> 00:22:18,806
Father...

171
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:21,429
- Sir William !
- My Lady...

172
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,805
There was nowhere else
we could meet in safety.

173
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:27,139
Listen to me carefully.

174
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:29,558
All things move in our favour.

175
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:33,186
Many of our friends
are returning from exile.

176
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:36,649
But these are most uncertain times

177
00:22:36,742 --> 00:22:39,067
and your life remains in danger.

178
00:22:39,161 --> 00:22:41,734
You must therefore say nothing

179
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:45,530
and meet no-one
whose visit may compromise you.

180
00:22:45,626 --> 00:22:46,906
No-one ?

181
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:49,872
No-one. Not even Lord Robert.

182
00:22:49,963 --> 00:22:55,502
- But he is a trusted friend.
- Child, listen to me. Please.

183
00:22:55,594 --> 00:22:59,638
You are most innocent
in the ways of this world

184
00:22:59,722 --> 00:23:01,797
and we must do all we may

185
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:05,010
to guarantee the security of your throne.

186
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:08,222
Now there is someone
I do wish you to meet.

187
00:23:08,314 --> 00:23:11,599
Monseigneur Alvaro de la Quadra,
the Spanish Ambassador.

188
00:23:11,692 --> 00:23:12,723
Why do l...

189
00:23:16,947 --> 00:23:18,773
My Lady,

190
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:22,032
I bring a message.

191
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:27,113
The King of Spain is enraptured,
and offers you his hand in marriage.

192
00:23:27,207 --> 00:23:29,697
My sister is not yet dead.

193
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:32,034
Her bed is still warm.

194
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:35,499
His Majesty finds it already cold.

195
00:23:48,477 --> 00:23:50,516
You must sign it.

196
00:23:50,604 --> 00:23:53,889
For the love of God, sign it.

197
00:23:57,235 --> 00:24:00,319
Will you leave your kingdom to a heretic ?

198
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,914
He then said that this King
would marry me

199
00:24:10,998 --> 00:24:15,576
but would not expect to share my bed
more than two or three times a year.

200
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,329
As much as that ?

201
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,166
Well, he...

202
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:24,132
He is enraptured.

203
00:24:24,219 --> 00:24:25,214
Naturally.

204
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:31,672
But... his affairs would otherwise
keep him in Spain.

205
00:24:33,395 --> 00:24:35,636
Then the King is a fool.

206
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:43,611
What could ever be important enough
to keep him from your bed ?

207
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,700
Robert,

208
00:24:55,791 --> 00:24:58,163
you should not say such things.

209
00:24:58,252 --> 00:25:00,291
Then I shall only think them.

210
00:25:04,508 --> 00:25:10,343
Everything is so uncertain !
Sir William says my life is still in danger.

211
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,094
Do not listen to everything he tells you.
Do not listen to any of them.

212
00:25:14,183 --> 00:25:15,890
None of them are of consequence.

213
00:25:15,977 --> 00:25:20,056
- When you are Queen...
- I am not... I am not Queen yet.

214
00:25:20,147 --> 00:25:22,104
You will be.

215
00:25:22,191 --> 00:25:23,898
Elizabeth,

216
00:25:23,984 --> 00:25:25,941
Queen of England.

217
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:29,478
A court to worship you.

218
00:25:29,573 --> 00:25:31,648
A country to obey you.

219
00:25:31,742 --> 00:25:34,659
Poems written celebrating your beauty.

220
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:39,406
Music composed in your honour,
and they will be nothing to you.

221
00:25:40,292 --> 00:25:42,331
I will mean nothing to you.

222
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:50,002
How could you ever be nothing to me ?

223
00:25:53,221 --> 00:25:56,305
Robert, you know
you are everything to me.

224
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:59,138
All that I am

225
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:01,265
it is you.

226
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,060
Benedicta tu in mulieribus

227
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:14,155
et benedictus fructus ventris tui, lesus.

228
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,114
Sancta Maria, Mater Dei

229
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,328
ora pro nobis peccatoribus, nunc...

230
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,916
Is she dead ?

231
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,394
Give it to her.

232
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:17,501
My Lady...

233
00:27:21,554 --> 00:27:24,009
The Earl of Sussex is here.

234
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:17,269
The Queen is dead !

235
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:19,772
Long live the Queen !

236
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:24,777
Long live the Queen !

237
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:34,738
This is the Lord's doing

238
00:28:36,584 --> 00:28:42,372
and it is marvellous in our eyes.

239
00:28:45,592 --> 00:28:48,545
To the north, I present unto you

240
00:28:48,637 --> 00:28:51,673
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen !

241
00:28:54,184 --> 00:28:56,425
To the south, I present to you

242
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,390
Elizabeth, your undoubted Queen !

243
00:30:16,804 --> 00:30:18,843
I crown thee Elizabeth,

244
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,800
Queen of England, lreland and France.

245
00:30:57,343 --> 00:30:59,798
God save Your Majesty.

246
00:31:04,516 --> 00:31:10,269
Your Majesty has inherited
a most parlous and degenerate state.

247
00:31:10,355 --> 00:31:13,854
It's threatened from abroad
by France and Spain

248
00:31:13,942 --> 00:31:17,393
and is weaker in men, monies and riches

249
00:31:17,487 --> 00:31:19,444
than I have ever known it.

250
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,024
What are you saying ?

251
00:31:21,115 --> 00:31:25,444
Madam, your treasury is empty.
The Navy is run-down,

252
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:28,821
there is no standing army,
and no munitions.

253
00:31:28,914 --> 00:31:33,243
There is not a fortress
that could withstand a single shot.

254
00:31:33,335 --> 00:31:37,249
- I have no desire for war, sir.
- But that is not the end of it.

255
00:31:37,339 --> 00:31:41,087
Here at home there are those
who wish Your Majesty ill.

256
00:31:41,176 --> 00:31:45,339
Mary of Scots has already
laid claim to your throne,

257
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,339
and Norfolk...

258
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:50,432
Norfolk covets it relentlessly.

259
00:31:50,518 --> 00:31:55,060
Madam, until you marry
and produce an heir,

260
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:58,609
you will find no security.

261
00:32:13,623 --> 00:32:15,662
That's Sir Christopher Hatton.

262
00:32:27,762 --> 00:32:30,003
- There is Sir William Makepeace...
- I do not see...

263
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:31,555
- Lord Ensley, Your Majesty.
- Delighted.

264
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:35,174
I do not see why a woman
need marry at all.

265
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:51,195
Come on, come on !

266
00:32:52,452 --> 00:32:54,491
This is Mistress Quickly.

267
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,257
You will recall His Excellency
the Spanish Ambassador.

268
00:33:14,348 --> 00:33:16,387
How could I forget ?

269
00:33:16,475 --> 00:33:17,470
Excellency.

270
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,598
Your Majesty.

271
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:25,725
He's French. You'll have to speak up.

272
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,781
Do I know that gentleman ?

273
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:42,203
That is Sir Francis Walsingham, Madam.
He has returned from exile

274
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:46,703
and I have appointed him
to have a care for Your Majesty's person.

275
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,711
Ah !

276
00:33:56,012 --> 00:33:57,589
Excellency...

277
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,135
Majesty...

278
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:11,597
May I present the French Ambassador,
His Excellency Monsieur de Foix.

279
00:34:11,694 --> 00:34:13,485
Your Excellency.

280
00:34:15,197 --> 00:34:19,324
I suppose the French
do offer some suitor to her.

281
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:21,318
Naturally.

282
00:34:21,411 --> 00:34:25,408
Everything now depends
upon the husband that woman takes.

283
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:27,657
King Henry of Anjou
sends you brotherly love.

284
00:34:27,751 --> 00:34:33,539
He trusts the relationship between
our countries may be much improved.

285
00:34:33,631 --> 00:34:35,006
That is also my hope.

286
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:40,048
The King expects that you will
consider the suit of his brother,

287
00:34:40,137 --> 00:34:42,627
the Duke of Anjou.

288
00:34:42,723 --> 00:34:46,554
Her Majesty will consider
the proposal most carefully.

289
00:34:49,897 --> 00:34:54,724
It is unfortunate, however,
that the Duke's aunt, Mary of Guise,

290
00:34:54,818 --> 00:34:58,352
chooses to garrison Scotland
with French troops.

291
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:03,777
Ladies...

292
00:35:08,122 --> 00:35:13,827
The marriage of a Queen, Excellency,
is born of politics, not childish passion.

293
00:35:22,469 --> 00:35:23,631
Your Grace.

294
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,760
Walsingham !

295
00:35:28,558 --> 00:35:30,597
Welcome to England.

296
00:35:30,685 --> 00:35:33,472
- Your Grace is surprised ?
- No.

297
00:35:33,563 --> 00:35:35,638
Only a little disappointed.

298
00:36:20,566 --> 00:36:22,605
Play a volta !

299
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:19,662
When may I see you in private ?

300
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,119
In private ?

301
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,748
Have you forgot, my Lord ?

302
00:37:27,046 --> 00:37:28,872
I am Queen now.

303
00:37:48,441 --> 00:37:49,816
He's coming.

304
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:51,063
He's coming !

305
00:38:04,498 --> 00:38:06,490
My Ladies.

306
00:38:06,583 --> 00:38:08,622
My Lord.

307
00:38:10,712 --> 00:38:13,915
You blush, Lady Knollys.

308
00:38:14,007 --> 00:38:16,213
Are you in love ?

309
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:17,960
No, my Lord.

310
00:38:18,053 --> 00:38:21,137
Then you should be,
or waste all that beauty.

311
00:38:30,606 --> 00:38:32,645
Does Her Majesty sleep ?

312
00:38:33,317 --> 00:38:35,356
Not yet, Sir William.

313
00:38:35,444 --> 00:38:37,685
She is... overwrought.

314
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:41,865
Show me Her Majesty's sheets
every morning.

315
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:47,110
- I must know all her proper functions.
- Proper functions, Sir William ?

316
00:38:47,205 --> 00:38:49,244
Indeed.

317
00:38:51,418 --> 00:38:56,756
Her Majesty's body and person
are no longer her own property.

318
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,962
They belong to the State.

319
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,089
Yes, Sir William.

320
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,858
Your Grace.

321
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:54,321
Your Grace, Her Majesty has not risen.

322
00:40:54,409 --> 00:40:56,235
Your Grace !

323
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:01,247
Please ! Your Grace ! Her Majesty
is not yet ready to receive visitors.

324
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,159
Madam !

325
00:41:05,879 --> 00:41:09,164
You had best get up.
There is some grave news.

326
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:16,509
My Lady, I'm sorry...

327
00:41:16,597 --> 00:41:21,389
Mary of Guise has increased the French
garrison in Scotland by 4,000 men.

328
00:41:21,477 --> 00:41:23,967
Perhaps more.

329
00:41:24,063 --> 00:41:25,605
Madam...

330
00:41:25,689 --> 00:41:30,231
I'm afraid the French mean to attack
while we are still weak

331
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,901
and while Your Majesty's reign
is still uncertain.

332
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,989
What is your counsel ?

333
00:41:39,077 --> 00:41:43,904
Madam, we must with all haste
raise an army to march upon Scotland.

334
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:50,750
Can... can... ?

335
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,839
Can we not send emissaries ?

336
00:41:56,927 --> 00:42:01,304
There is no time for that !
As Queen we look to you for action,

337
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:07,309
unless you are content to wait for the
French to send more reinforcements.

338
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:08,853
Here.

339
00:42:23,744 --> 00:42:25,783
Are you all in agreement ?

340
00:42:25,871 --> 00:42:30,912
I say there has never been a better time
to abate the French pride.

341
00:42:31,001 --> 00:42:31,996
Arundel ?

342
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:37,088
War is a sin,
but sometimes a necessary one.

343
00:42:40,886 --> 00:42:46,046
Lord Robert, you were appointed to the
Council to protect England's interests.

344
00:42:46,141 --> 00:42:49,225
Now it appears
you do not have the stomach for it.

345
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:51,136
I am in agreement, Your Grace,

346
00:42:51,229 --> 00:42:56,021
ifYour Majesty's throne is at risk.

347
00:43:03,657 --> 00:43:06,990
- What say you, Walsingham ?
- Your Majesty !

348
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:10,410
I say a prince should rather
be slow to take action

349
00:43:10,497 --> 00:43:16,083
and should watch that he does not
come to be afraid of his own shadow.

350
00:43:16,169 --> 00:43:20,462
You are not, Sir Francis,
a member of Council,

351
00:43:20,548 --> 00:43:22,540
nor are you in the majority.

352
00:43:24,552 --> 00:43:26,591
I do not like wars.

353
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:30,385
They have uncertain outcomes.

354
00:45:17,201 --> 00:45:21,198
SCOTLAND

355
00:45:53,235 --> 00:45:54,610
Stop !

356
00:46:29,436 --> 00:46:31,677
Go back to England,

357
00:46:31,771 --> 00:46:34,261
and take this to your Queen.

358
00:46:36,568 --> 00:46:39,438
English blood on French colours.

359
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,614
Send him back to his Queen

360
00:46:43,699 --> 00:46:48,325
and make sure he remains alive.

361
00:46:50,289 --> 00:46:55,531
Tell that bastard Queen not to send
children to fight Mary of Guise !

362
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,135
- Where are my councillors ?
- I know not, Madam.

363
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:13,802
- Where is Lord Robert ?
- Lord Robert, Madam, has gone hunting.

364
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:20,647
Leave me.

365
00:47:20,735 --> 00:47:22,774
Go ! Go !

366
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:31,775
I regret to inform Your Majesty
of our miserable defeat in Scotland.

367
00:47:31,870 --> 00:47:35,155
The Bishops still demand
Your Majesty's removal.

368
00:47:35,248 --> 00:47:38,248
They find support in every quarter.

369
00:47:39,461 --> 00:47:43,161
Alas, Madam,
we are come already to catastrophe.

370
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:20,117
How dare you come into my presence !

371
00:48:23,169 --> 00:48:25,208
Why do you follow me here ?

372
00:48:25,296 --> 00:48:28,795
It is my business
to protect Your Majesty

373
00:48:30,134 --> 00:48:32,173
against all things.

374
00:48:32,261 --> 00:48:36,305
I do not need protection.
I need to be left alone !

375
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:38,429
Majesty...

376
00:48:39,434 --> 00:48:43,016
They should never have been
sent to Scotland.

377
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:48,856
My father would not have made
such a mistake.

378
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:52,893
I have been proved unfit to rule.

379
00:48:54,449 --> 00:48:58,576
That is what you all think,
is it not, Walsingham ?

380
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:00,653
It is not for me to judge you.

381
00:49:03,457 --> 00:49:08,795
Why did they send children ! Why
did they not send proper reinforcements !

382
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,548
The Bishops would not let them.

383
00:49:11,632 --> 00:49:14,835
They spoke against it in the pulpits.

384
00:49:14,926 --> 00:49:19,255
Then... they are speaking
against their Queen.

385
00:49:19,347 --> 00:49:23,759
Madam, the Bishops are against you
and have no fear of you.

386
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:26,521
They do not expect you to survive.

387
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,364
My Lord ! The Queen !

388
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,679
Where have you been ?

389
00:50:11,146 --> 00:50:13,185
You were not at Court.

390
00:50:15,692 --> 00:50:17,731
Majesty, Monsieur de Foix.

391
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,858
Mary of Guise, Ma'am,

392
00:50:19,946 --> 00:50:24,275
promises to make no further threat
against Your Majesty, but

393
00:50:24,367 --> 00:50:26,406
on one condition.

394
00:50:26,828 --> 00:50:28,867
What condition ?

395
00:50:29,581 --> 00:50:35,369
That Your Majesty considers the proposal
of her nephew the Duke of Anjou.

396
00:50:43,636 --> 00:50:47,503
The Duke is most eager
to meet Your Majesty.

397
00:50:47,598 --> 00:50:50,682
He has heard a great deal of your beauty.

398
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:56,552
For the love of God, Madam, let not
the care of your diseased estate

399
00:50:56,648 --> 00:50:59,565
hang in the balance any longer.

400
00:50:59,651 --> 00:51:04,193
In marriage,
and in the production of an heir,

401
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,990
Iies your only surety.

402
00:51:06,991 --> 00:51:09,991
The Duke is also most... handsome.

403
00:51:21,630 --> 00:51:23,669
Very well.

404
00:51:25,717 --> 00:51:27,424
Invite the Duke of Anjou.

405
00:51:28,929 --> 00:51:31,384
We shall see him in the flesh.

406
00:51:41,691 --> 00:51:43,730
Robert !

407
00:51:43,818 --> 00:51:48,526
The Duke will not take kindly
to a rival for his suit.

408
00:51:48,614 --> 00:51:52,445
He is a traitor,
and his father before him.

409
00:51:52,534 --> 00:51:57,444
Lord Robert's head
will end up on a spike,

410
00:51:57,539 --> 00:52:00,160
not on the pillow of a Queen.

411
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,968
Must you leave ?

412
00:52:15,056 --> 00:52:17,926
I would not miss this for the world.

413
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:22,978
Today I shall watch the fall
of that heretic girl.

414
00:52:26,733 --> 00:52:30,860
I have been placed here
as your sov...

415
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:40,075
I am your sovereign.
I have been placed here...

416
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,497
I...

417
00:52:44,584 --> 00:52:47,952
God has... God has placed me here...

418
00:52:48,045 --> 00:52:50,832
I am your anointed sovereign...

419
00:52:50,923 --> 00:52:54,374
I am your Queen...
And like my father I mean to rule.

420
00:52:54,468 --> 00:52:59,378
There is one thing higher than royalty,
my Lords, and that

421
00:53:00,390 --> 00:53:02,429
is religion.

422
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:05,802
I pass this... I pass this Act of...

423
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:07,805
I ask you to pa... I...

424
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:10,982
I ask you to pass this Act of Uniformity.

425
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,940
Not for myself. For my people.

426
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,319
They're my people...

427
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:21,400
There is one God. We have
a common... There is one God.

428
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:26,452
This is for my people.
My people are my care.

429
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:28,579
The only care.

430
00:53:28,667 --> 00:53:32,118
My Lords, your votes are nothing
without my consent.

431
00:53:46,017 --> 00:53:52,055
If there is no uniformity
of religious belief here

432
00:53:52,148 --> 00:53:56,690
then there can only be fragmentation.

433
00:53:58,654 --> 00:54:00,693
Disputes and quarrels.

434
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:08,952
Surely, my Lords, it is better
to have a single Church of England.

435
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:21,465
A single Church of England !

436
00:54:21,551 --> 00:54:24,088
With a common prayer book.

437
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,217
And... and a...

438
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:31,760
And... a common purpose.

439
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,851
I ask you to pass
this Act of Uniformity

440
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:42,433
not... not for myself

441
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,359
but for my people

442
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,531
who are my only care.

443
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,828
Madam, by this Act,

444
00:54:55,291 --> 00:55:00,036
you force us to relinquish
our allegiance to the Holy Father.

445
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,880
Hear, hear !

446
00:55:04,967 --> 00:55:07,457
How can I force you, Your Grace ?

447
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:09,592
I am a woman.

448
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,141
I have no desire
to make windows into men's souls.

449
00:55:19,231 --> 00:55:21,270
I simply ask

450
00:55:22,484 --> 00:55:24,523
can any man, in truth,

451
00:55:26,196 --> 00:55:28,437
serve two masters

452
00:55:28,531 --> 00:55:31,235
and be faithful to both ?

453
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:33,531
Madam, this is heresy !

454
00:55:33,619 --> 00:55:36,323
No, Your Grace, this is

455
00:55:36,414 --> 00:55:38,453
common sense.

456
00:55:38,541 --> 00:55:41,625
Which is a most English virtue.

457
00:55:44,588 --> 00:55:47,458
Where is Gardiner ?
Where are the others ?

458
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:49,043
Let us out !

459
00:55:49,134 --> 00:55:51,173
Open the door !

460
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:56,593
This is Walsingham's doing.

461
00:55:56,933 --> 00:55:58,972
It is the devil's work.

462
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,729
It will not serve her in any case.

463
00:56:02,271 --> 00:56:07,063
The Bishops will pass no measure
which severs us from Rome.

464
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:14,073
Your Majesty would improve
all these matters

465
00:56:14,158 --> 00:56:16,446
if you would agree to marry.

466
00:56:16,535 --> 00:56:18,574
Aye. Marry, Madam.

467
00:56:19,413 --> 00:56:23,540
Aye. But marry who, Your Grace ?

468
00:56:24,501 --> 00:56:27,371
Will you give me some suggestion ?

469
00:56:28,713 --> 00:56:32,840
For some say France,
and others Spain, and

470
00:56:32,967 --> 00:56:36,382
and some cannot abide foreigners at all.

471
00:56:36,471 --> 00:56:41,595
So I'm not sure how best to please you
unless I married one of each.

472
00:56:46,564 --> 00:56:50,643
Now Your Majesty does make fun
of the sanctity of marriage.

473
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:55,442
I do not think you should lecture me
on that, my Lord,

474
00:56:55,530 --> 00:56:59,657
since you yourself
have been twice divorced.

475
00:56:59,743 --> 00:57:02,779
And are now upon your third wife !

476
00:57:09,168 --> 00:57:13,295
Each of you must vote
according to your conscience.

477
00:57:15,216 --> 00:57:17,255
But remember this.

478
00:57:18,427 --> 00:57:20,668
In your hands,

479
00:57:21,555 --> 00:57:23,796
upon this moment,

480
00:57:24,766 --> 00:57:28,893
Iies the future happiness of my people,

481
00:57:28,979 --> 00:57:31,267
and the peace

482
00:57:31,356 --> 00:57:33,395
of this realm.

483
00:57:35,193 --> 00:57:39,605
Let that be upon your conscience also.

484
00:57:46,287 --> 00:57:48,991
My Lords, the House will divide.

485
00:57:58,215 --> 00:58:00,254
Walsingham... !

486
00:58:00,342 --> 00:58:04,837
I would know on what authority
you have kept us locked up here.

487
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:08,879
Your Graces must forgive me,
but you are now free to go.

488
00:58:08,975 --> 00:58:13,517
I am sure this infernal work
has not saved your bastard Queen.

489
00:58:14,939 --> 00:58:17,690
Her Majesty... has won the argument.

490
00:58:18,734 --> 00:58:20,773
By what count ?

491
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:24,269
By five, Your Grace.

492
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:27,989
Five.

493
00:58:29,828 --> 00:58:32,116
You will be damned for this !

494
00:58:32,205 --> 00:58:36,332
And I pray God your wretched soul
will burn in hell !

495
00:59:17,165 --> 00:59:19,869
Report back to me at break of day.

496
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:07,041
Enchante.

497
01:00:11,216 --> 01:00:12,081
No !

498
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:15,674
Because... I am Anjou !

499
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,510
Yes, I am Anjou, yes ! I am Anjou.

500
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:28,186
My God ! She loves it !

501
01:00:35,739 --> 01:00:37,778
And I can't wait...

502
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:42,611
I dream of the moment
when we are naked together in bed

503
01:00:42,704 --> 01:00:46,404
where I can stroke your thigh
and perhaps even

504
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,575
your quinny ?

505
01:00:49,836 --> 01:00:51,627
Would you like that ?

506
01:00:51,713 --> 01:00:53,871
Remove your hand.

507
01:00:53,965 --> 01:00:57,049
Perhaps, Your Grace,
we shall think on it, but...

508
01:00:57,135 --> 01:01:01,262
- I am deeply religious.
- But I am very religious, too.

509
01:01:01,347 --> 01:01:04,217
Very religious, yes !

510
01:01:09,688 --> 01:01:14,563
THE VATICAN

511
01:01:20,073 --> 01:01:24,200
Your Holiness,
the priest from England is here.

512
01:01:43,596 --> 01:01:49,265
Tell me, my son, what is the news
of our brothers and sisters in England ?

513
01:01:49,768 --> 01:01:54,809
Do they still support the sovereignty
of that illegitimate whore ?

514
01:01:54,898 --> 01:01:56,522
No, Holy Father.

515
01:01:56,608 --> 01:02:01,234
They pray ceaselessly that England
may be recovered from heresy.

516
01:02:01,321 --> 01:02:04,440
Prayers may not be sufficient.

517
01:02:04,532 --> 01:02:06,939
I will ask for guidance in this matter.

518
01:02:07,034 --> 01:02:09,489
But do not despair.

519
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:15,663
Was it not truly said
that the righteous shall inherit the earth ?

520
01:02:27,429 --> 01:02:29,468
Such piercing eyes !

521
01:02:29,556 --> 01:02:31,595
And very indiscreet !

522
01:03:04,339 --> 01:03:08,122
My true love has my heart

523
01:03:09,177 --> 01:03:11,216
and I have hers.

524
01:03:11,637 --> 01:03:13,676
My heart in me

525
01:03:13,764 --> 01:03:16,219
keeps her and me in one.

526
01:03:16,434 --> 01:03:21,095
My heart in her,
her thoughts and senses guide.

527
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:23,429
She loves my heart

528
01:03:24,024 --> 01:03:26,811
for once it was her own.

529
01:03:27,903 --> 01:03:29,942
I cherish hers

530
01:03:31,448 --> 01:03:34,318
because in me it bides.

531
01:03:36,953 --> 01:03:39,408
My true love has my heart

532
01:03:39,497 --> 01:03:41,156
and I

533
01:03:41,249 --> 01:03:42,743
have hers.

534
01:03:42,834 --> 01:03:43,829
Marry me.

535
01:04:01,268 --> 01:04:03,307
Marry me.

536
01:04:05,730 --> 01:04:09,513
The Queen is very intimate
with Lord Robert, no ?

537
01:04:09,609 --> 01:04:14,021
With me she plays the shrew.
With him the lover ?

538
01:04:15,448 --> 01:04:19,231
Her life depends on the feelings
of my heart, yes ?

539
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:23,027
She is a woman, Sire.

540
01:04:23,122 --> 01:04:26,371
They say one thing but mean another.

541
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:28,534
No man can unlock their secrets.

542
01:04:28,627 --> 01:04:31,164
Unless they have

543
01:04:31,255 --> 01:04:33,792
a very big key !

544
01:04:36,093 --> 01:04:37,088
Yes !

545
01:04:37,177 --> 01:04:40,296
A very big key !

546
01:04:45,018 --> 01:04:47,057
On a night such as this

547
01:04:47,145 --> 01:04:49,184
could any woman say no ?

548
01:04:50,857 --> 01:04:52,896
On a night such as this

549
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,899
could a Queen say no ?

550
01:04:56,779 --> 01:05:01,405
Does not a Queen sit under
the same stars as any other woman ?

551
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:07,118
Monseigneur Alvaro !

552
01:05:07,831 --> 01:05:09,408
Monseigneur Alvaro !

553
01:05:09,499 --> 01:05:11,290
Tell me,

554
01:05:11,376 --> 01:05:15,503
as well as Ambassador,
are you not also a Bishop ?

555
01:05:16,965 --> 01:05:19,337
I am, my Lord.

556
01:05:19,425 --> 01:05:21,132
Then you can marry us !

557
01:05:23,054 --> 01:05:25,295
Marry you ?

558
01:05:26,307 --> 01:05:30,849
Perhaps he does not know enough
English to perform the ceremony !

559
01:05:30,936 --> 01:05:35,063
Alas, Madam, in this matter
I can be of no help to you.

560
01:05:38,944 --> 01:05:40,354
Madam !

561
01:05:42,864 --> 01:05:44,322
The Queen !

562
01:05:44,408 --> 01:05:46,566
- Protect the Queen !
- Help her !

563
01:05:47,702 --> 01:05:49,943
Quickly ! Call the Guard !

564
01:05:52,874 --> 01:05:55,411
The Queen ! The Queen !

565
01:05:55,501 --> 01:05:57,742
Look to the Queen !

566
01:06:09,431 --> 01:06:12,550
Isabel, see that the ladies are prepared.

567
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:13,638
Isabel, go !

568
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:15,766
Where were you, Sir Francis ?

569
01:06:15,854 --> 01:06:22,057
I only hope that Her Majesty may be
safely delivered from this present danger.

570
01:06:25,488 --> 01:06:27,527
Is the bedchamber ready ?

571
01:06:27,615 --> 01:06:30,022
Be calm, Madam. All is well.

572
01:06:30,118 --> 01:06:32,157
I am perfectly well.

573
01:06:32,787 --> 01:06:34,826
Please do not fuss.

574
01:06:39,251 --> 01:06:42,584
- No-one is to enter.
- Yes, Sir William.

575
01:06:44,465 --> 01:06:48,379
- Stay in here now, and watch.
- Yes, Sir Francis.

576
01:06:56,434 --> 01:06:58,177
Sorry, Lord Robert.

577
01:07:01,981 --> 01:07:03,225
I said no-one.

578
01:07:15,953 --> 01:07:17,862
My Lord,

579
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:19,614
a word.

580
01:07:38,057 --> 01:07:40,512
To whose advantage was this ?

581
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:42,474
De Foix ?

582
01:07:44,772 --> 01:07:46,396
No.

583
01:07:46,482 --> 01:07:48,521
Not with Anjou in play.

584
01:07:49,318 --> 01:07:51,725
Then some... madman ?

585
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:54,773
There is always madness, Master Elyot.

586
01:07:54,865 --> 01:07:58,565
This was devised.
There is reason behind it.

587
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:01,199
Then Alvaro

588
01:08:01,287 --> 01:08:03,575
for he has most cause.

589
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:05,787
Yes, but he was present.

590
01:08:05,875 --> 01:08:08,116
He is too subtle for that.

591
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:11,245
Would Norfolk ?

592
01:08:11,339 --> 01:08:15,418
He is not so subtle
and has even more cause.

593
01:08:15,509 --> 01:08:17,548
Indeed.

594
01:08:17,636 --> 01:08:19,295
So then

595
01:08:19,388 --> 01:08:22,472
he is not in league with the Spanish.

596
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:25,048
Perhaps. Stay close to him.

597
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,633
The Duke has some other game.

598
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:30,266
I must find where he plays.

599
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:35,983
I see it is true that the Queen
favours you above all others.

600
01:08:36,696 --> 01:08:40,823
But you have many enemies here.
Is it not so ?

601
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:43,363
That is no concern of yours.

602
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:47,243
It may be.

603
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:51,875
If you would be prepared,
in secret, to renounce heresy

604
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:54,368
and embrace the true faith,

605
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:58,923
then you might find
many new and powerful friends

606
01:08:59,968 --> 01:09:01,794
and

607
01:09:02,304 --> 01:09:04,343
keep your Queen.

608
01:09:06,766 --> 01:09:09,766
You are most mistaken, Monseigneur,

609
01:09:09,853 --> 01:09:13,268
if you think
I might so easily be persuaded

610
01:09:13,356 --> 01:09:15,644
to act against my conscience,

611
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:18,105
and my love.

612
01:09:18,819 --> 01:09:20,858
My Lord,

613
01:09:22,156 --> 01:09:24,943
what will a man not do for love ?

614
01:09:35,377 --> 01:09:38,876
Madam, if only you would heed my advice.

615
01:09:39,214 --> 01:09:44,800
I narrowly escaped with my life, sir.
I cannot now discuss marriage.

616
01:09:45,970 --> 01:09:50,512
Forgive me... the one
cannot be separated from the other.

617
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:53,933
- Have I not told you ?
- Yes, and I am sick of it.

618
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:57,602
This entire conversation is ill-timed.

619
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:01,393
My patience, Sir William, is not infinite.

620
01:10:12,954 --> 01:10:16,785
It is a great joy to see
Your Majesty is not hurt.

621
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,116
It was a terrible affair.

622
01:10:20,294 --> 01:10:24,421
The Duke would still
know the answer to his suit.

623
01:10:24,882 --> 01:10:29,045
You may tell the Duke
he shall have his answer shortly.

624
01:10:29,136 --> 01:10:31,461
Madam, the point is pressing !

625
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:39,012
The Duke cannot love me so much if
he demands my answer so precipitously !

626
01:10:39,104 --> 01:10:43,101
Perhaps Her Majesty's heart
is already set upon another.

627
01:10:46,611 --> 01:10:51,438
Do not presume, monsieur,
to know the secrets of my heart.

628
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:56,365
Monsieur de Foix may leave.

629
01:10:57,496 --> 01:10:59,535
Please, Excellency...

630
01:10:59,665 --> 01:11:02,120
Je vous prie de mes excuses.

631
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,499
Secrets, Madam ?!

632
01:11:06,213 --> 01:11:08,252
You have no secrets !

633
01:11:08,340 --> 01:11:12,040
The world knows Lord Robert
visits your chambers and you

634
01:11:12,135 --> 01:11:14,174
fornicate with him !

635
01:11:14,262 --> 01:11:17,547
It's even said you already carry his child !

636
01:11:17,641 --> 01:11:22,551
Yes, Sir William, I live my life in the open !
I am surrounded by people !

637
01:11:22,645 --> 01:11:27,639
I do not understand how so bad
a judgment has been formed of me !

638
01:11:27,733 --> 01:11:29,690
Madam, you...

639
01:11:29,777 --> 01:11:31,568
You cannot marry Lord Robert !

640
01:11:37,451 --> 01:11:39,490
He is already married.

641
01:11:59,972 --> 01:12:02,427
Here comes our married man.

642
01:12:03,434 --> 01:12:06,103
Lord Dudley is not himself today.

643
01:12:06,604 --> 01:12:09,640
Lord Dudley's cup runneth over.

644
01:12:12,067 --> 01:12:15,815
Imagine being discovered
in another woman's bed !

645
01:12:15,904 --> 01:12:18,655
Aye, and that it to be his wife's !

646
01:12:29,667 --> 01:12:33,794
Lord Robert, we are amazed
you show your face at Court.

647
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,919
The Queen !

648
01:13:09,997 --> 01:13:11,241
Spanish !

649
01:13:11,749 --> 01:13:13,124
Spanish !

650
01:13:15,169 --> 01:13:17,208
English pirate !

651
01:13:37,774 --> 01:13:39,813
English pirate !

652
01:13:39,901 --> 01:13:44,977
Is it not enough that English
pirates attack and rob our ships

653
01:13:45,072 --> 01:13:48,072
but we are to be made fools of
in this Court.

654
01:13:48,158 --> 01:13:53,318
The King, my master, has become
impatient for Your Grace to act.

655
01:13:55,165 --> 01:13:58,414
If you will not, then others may.

656
01:13:58,502 --> 01:14:02,499
You must reassure His Majesty
the time is close at hand.

657
01:14:02,589 --> 01:14:04,664
He must not act precipitously.

658
01:14:08,553 --> 01:14:12,550
- His Majesty has heard a rumour
- The world is filled with rumours.

659
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:18,559
that Your Grace has made contact with
Mary of Scots to promote your ambitions.

660
01:14:18,646 --> 01:14:20,934
Even that you mean to marry her.

661
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:23,560
Do you suppose me an idiot ?

662
01:14:23,651 --> 01:14:28,893
Your master is the most powerful man
in the world. I would not cross him.

663
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:37,610
Will the Duke not come to dance ?

664
01:14:37,706 --> 01:14:42,616
Madam, His Grace is indisposed.
He has some pains of the stomach.

665
01:14:42,710 --> 01:14:44,334
Oh.

666
01:14:44,837 --> 01:14:47,292
I am very sorry for it.

667
01:14:54,096 --> 01:14:56,847
We wish to give the Duke this ring

668
01:14:58,016 --> 01:15:00,471
as a token of our love.

669
01:15:00,561 --> 01:15:03,016
- Madam...
- No.

670
01:15:03,105 --> 01:15:05,642
I shall give it to him myself.

671
01:15:05,732 --> 01:15:07,771
Madam, I should not...

672
01:15:07,859 --> 01:15:09,898
Sir William.

673
01:15:09,986 --> 01:15:11,812
Come along.

674
01:16:19,677 --> 01:16:21,716
What !

675
01:16:23,306 --> 01:16:25,345
What ?

676
01:16:25,766 --> 01:16:27,390
What, er... what !

677
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:33,811
You stare, Madam.

678
01:16:37,694 --> 01:16:39,733
What is it ?

679
01:16:39,821 --> 01:16:41,860
Do you see

680
01:16:41,948 --> 01:16:44,617
something strange, perhaps ?

681
01:16:48,621 --> 01:16:51,491
You are wearing a dress, Your Grace.

682
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:56,620
Oh ! Yes, I am wearing a dress.
Yes, yes, I am wearing a dress !

683
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:59,916
I wear a dress like this,
my mother, and you.

684
01:17:00,007 --> 01:17:05,048
But I only dress like this when I'm alone,
in private, with my friends.

685
01:17:06,847 --> 01:17:08,886
Your Grace...

686
01:17:28,743 --> 01:17:31,992
Although my affection for you
is undiminished

687
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:35,245
I have, after an agonising struggle,

688
01:17:35,333 --> 01:17:40,837
determined to sacrifice my own happiness
for the welfare of my people.

689
01:17:40,921 --> 01:17:42,249
My God !

690
01:17:49,179 --> 01:17:51,218
Madam, I will explain.

691
01:17:51,306 --> 01:17:54,390
There is no need, Excellency.

692
01:17:55,185 --> 01:17:58,055
I understand everything !

693
01:17:59,022 --> 01:18:00,397
Allez-vous-en, allez !

694
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:05,398
Jouez ! Jouez !

695
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:10,778
Up yours !

696
01:18:19,082 --> 01:18:21,833
Madam, is the, er... is the Duke...

697
01:18:21,918 --> 01:18:25,002
There will be no more talk of marriage.

698
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:45,396
Lord Robert !

699
01:18:49,069 --> 01:18:51,108
Your Majesty ?

700
01:18:53,282 --> 01:18:55,488
Will you dance ?

701
01:18:57,911 --> 01:18:59,950
If it please you.

702
01:19:04,709 --> 01:19:06,748
Play a volta !

703
01:19:23,727 --> 01:19:25,849
Why will you not see me ?

704
01:19:38,992 --> 01:19:41,364
You must let me explain.

705
01:19:41,452 --> 01:19:44,121
Others will take advantage of this.

706
01:19:44,205 --> 01:19:48,036
You must not believe
what they tell you. They are jealous

707
01:19:48,125 --> 01:19:51,743
and envious,
because I am nothing to them

708
01:19:51,837 --> 01:19:54,374
and everything to you.

709
01:19:54,715 --> 01:19:56,754
Do you love her ?

710
01:20:00,971 --> 01:20:04,055
No, I love you.
I have always loved you.

711
01:20:04,140 --> 01:20:08,007
I was afraid of losing you
because I was not free !

712
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:11,352
For God's sake,
you are still my Elizabeth !

713
01:20:13,858 --> 01:20:16,146
I am not your Elizabeth !

714
01:20:18,029 --> 01:20:20,068
I am no man's Elizabeth !

715
01:20:20,156 --> 01:20:23,192
And if you think to rule here
you are mistaken !

716
01:20:29,915 --> 01:20:31,990
I will have one mistress here

717
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,750
and no master !

718
01:21:08,577 --> 01:21:12,740
It matters nothing to me.
I can live without her

719
01:21:13,039 --> 01:21:15,197
most happily.

720
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,864
Better than I could live with her.

721
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:24,880
I have no need of her love.
Have I not suffered enough already

722
01:21:24,967 --> 01:21:27,374
for loving her and showing it ?

723
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:29,509
I envy you, my Lord.

724
01:21:29,889 --> 01:21:32,379
To love a woman so deeply.

725
01:21:32,474 --> 01:21:36,886
Monseigneur... envy no man for that.

726
01:21:39,314 --> 01:21:41,721
Such love is hateful.

727
01:21:41,817 --> 01:21:46,312
It tears the soul apart. Envy a man
who has never known such love.

728
01:21:46,404 --> 01:21:50,650
Perhaps there may still be a way
to reclaim her affections.

729
01:21:50,742 --> 01:21:52,319
Why should I want to ?

730
01:21:52,410 --> 01:21:54,283
And to save her life.

731
01:21:54,370 --> 01:21:57,074
- You jest with me.
- No, I do not.

732
01:21:57,164 --> 01:22:02,750
For she will be dead soon enough,
perhaps even at Norfolk's hand,

733
01:22:02,836 --> 01:22:04,875
if you do not help her.

734
01:22:06,173 --> 01:22:08,130
How can I help her ?

735
01:22:10,219 --> 01:22:12,258
She will not even see me.

736
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:21,717
His Holiness has issued the Bull.

737
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:27,317
It deprives Elizabeth, pretended Queen
of England, servant of wickedness,

738
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:29,440
of her throne,

739
01:22:29,529 --> 01:22:35,068
and declares that her subjects
are absolved of their allegiance to her.

740
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:40,578
His Holiness also decrees that any man

741
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:44,531
who should undertake her assassination

742
01:22:44,626 --> 01:22:48,753
will be welcomed by angels
into the Kingdom of Heaven.

743
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:54,589
Give these letters of blessing
and hope to our friends in England.

744
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:03,804
THE COAST OF ENGLAND

745
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:45,179
Your Grace.

746
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,389
Monseigneur.

747
01:23:56,569 --> 01:23:58,608
And Thomas Elyot.

748
01:24:00,865 --> 01:24:03,320
You serve your master well, Elyot.

749
01:24:04,243 --> 01:24:06,282
As well as I can, in truth.

750
01:24:06,704 --> 01:24:08,743
I mean your real master.

751
01:24:10,374 --> 01:24:12,413
What's this ?

752
01:24:12,668 --> 01:24:14,707
What master ?

753
01:24:14,795 --> 01:24:16,372
Walsingham.

754
01:24:16,463 --> 01:24:19,547
The priest is mistaken, my Lord.

755
01:24:19,633 --> 01:24:23,132
I am Your Grace's servant,
as God is my witness.

756
01:25:07,887 --> 01:25:10,971
- Isabel...
- Sshh, don't fuss.

757
01:25:15,519 --> 01:25:20,429
You should not try them on, lsabel.
They are the Queen's dresses.

758
01:25:20,524 --> 01:25:22,563
Why not ?

759
01:26:14,993 --> 01:26:17,032
You're my secret.

760
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,159
I am Queen, aren't I ?

761
01:26:19,747 --> 01:26:21,786
Say you're mine.

762
01:26:24,210 --> 01:26:26,249
You're my Elizabeth.

763
01:26:27,129 --> 01:26:29,168
Say you're my Elizabeth.

764
01:26:29,465 --> 01:26:31,504
I am your Elizabeth.

765
01:26:38,765 --> 01:26:40,840
I am your Queen !

766
01:26:49,525 --> 01:26:51,564
Ssh... !

767
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:55,818
Sshh... !

768
01:27:18,136 --> 01:27:20,175
Kat ?

769
01:27:22,473 --> 01:27:24,512
Kat !

770
01:27:37,863 --> 01:27:40,270
Kat ?

771
01:27:48,289 --> 01:27:50,328
Who are you ?

772
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:54,533
You will declare yourself to me.

773
01:27:59,634 --> 01:28:01,092
Madam !

774
01:28:02,470 --> 01:28:06,799
Something has happened !
You must come quickly !

775
01:28:06,932 --> 01:28:08,971
Who was with her ?

776
01:28:09,059 --> 01:28:13,637
One of the guards found her.
He says he saw Lord Robert leave...

777
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,521
No, Madam, no.

778
01:28:15,607 --> 01:28:18,180
The dress was poisoned.

779
01:28:19,027 --> 01:28:21,600
Uncover her.

780
01:28:24,991 --> 01:28:27,660
No... ! That dress was a gift

781
01:28:28,703 --> 01:28:30,742
for me.

782
01:28:31,664 --> 01:28:33,703
French silk.

783
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:39,336
SCOTLAND

784
01:28:51,975 --> 01:28:54,014
Vite ! Vite !

785
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,159
Sir Francis,

786
01:29:16,206 --> 01:29:19,824
you and I must be honest with each other.

787
01:29:24,714 --> 01:29:26,753
Your Queen is weak.

788
01:29:27,884 --> 01:29:29,923
She has no army,

789
01:29:30,011 --> 01:29:33,047
no friends. Only...

790
01:29:33,139 --> 01:29:34,763
Comment dit-on... ?

791
01:29:35,641 --> 01:29:37,514
- Enemies.
- Enemies.

792
01:29:37,602 --> 01:29:39,393
Mm-hm.

793
01:29:39,478 --> 01:29:41,517
What terms can she propose ?

794
01:29:42,022 --> 01:29:44,809
Madam, Her Majesty was, I believe,

795
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:48,564
too hasty at rejecting
the Duke's proposal of marriage.

796
01:29:49,113 --> 01:29:51,817
But how can I marry such a woman ?
Huh ?

797
01:29:51,907 --> 01:29:53,733
She is frigid !

798
01:29:55,118 --> 01:29:58,367
Yes ! They even say she is really a man !

799
01:29:59,539 --> 01:30:02,705
Go to bed. Leave me with this.

800
01:30:04,961 --> 01:30:06,918
Forgive my nephew.

801
01:30:07,005 --> 01:30:09,412
He speaks when he should not.

802
01:30:09,507 --> 01:30:11,546
He is terrible.

803
01:30:23,270 --> 01:30:25,345
Ne fais pas I'idiot, Henri.

804
01:30:32,821 --> 01:30:36,865
I hear you are a wise man, Sir Francis,

805
01:30:36,950 --> 01:30:39,737
and a creature of the world

806
01:30:39,827 --> 01:30:41,369
Iike me.

807
01:30:48,002 --> 01:30:50,041
Yes.

808
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,712
I have no illusions.

809
01:30:58,053 --> 01:31:01,137
I know it is only a matter of time

810
01:31:01,723 --> 01:31:04,593
before my Queen is overthrown.

811
01:31:09,022 --> 01:31:12,106
Her Majesty rules with the heart,

812
01:31:14,402 --> 01:31:16,477
not with the head.

813
01:31:16,571 --> 01:31:18,610
I understand.

814
01:31:19,281 --> 01:31:22,780
It is hard for a woman to forget her heart.

815
01:31:26,455 --> 01:31:28,494
But, er...

816
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,247
what of you,

817
01:31:32,586 --> 01:31:34,625
Walsingham ?

818
01:31:36,506 --> 01:31:41,132
A wise man would be careful
not to put himself in the way of harm.

819
01:31:43,930 --> 01:31:46,966
And how would a wise man do that ?

820
01:31:47,725 --> 01:31:51,010
He would, as I said, change allegiance.

821
01:31:52,688 --> 01:31:54,727
Allegiance ?

822
01:31:59,028 --> 01:32:01,103
There are but two choices.

823
01:32:02,156 --> 01:32:06,235
He would get into bed
with either Spain or France.

824
01:32:09,454 --> 01:32:11,493
And whose bed

825
01:32:11,581 --> 01:32:13,407
would you prefer ?

826
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:34,184
Your Majesty, may I speak with you ?

827
01:32:34,269 --> 01:32:36,142
In private.

828
01:32:46,072 --> 01:32:48,111
Speak.

829
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:51,869
You are in the greatest danger.

830
01:32:52,328 --> 01:32:54,783
You must believe me.

831
01:32:56,082 --> 01:32:58,121
But you have a friend.

832
01:32:58,209 --> 01:33:01,328
Someone who can guarantee your safety

833
01:33:02,588 --> 01:33:04,710
and your throne.

834
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,007
A friend ?

835
01:33:12,681 --> 01:33:14,720
The King of Spain.

836
01:33:18,228 --> 01:33:20,267
Leave us.

837
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:33,486
How would he guarantee it ?

838
01:33:37,079 --> 01:33:39,118
He would marry you.

839
01:33:42,084 --> 01:33:45,748
Only to make an alliance. Nothing more.

840
01:33:46,838 --> 01:33:49,163
He would not expect to...

841
01:33:50,258 --> 01:33:52,297
He would live in Spain.

842
01:33:54,721 --> 01:33:57,425
Why do you do this, Robert ?

843
01:33:57,515 --> 01:34:00,302
Because I love you.

844
01:34:00,393 --> 01:34:05,434
And though you will not see me,
I am the only one who would care for you.

845
01:34:05,523 --> 01:34:09,852
You love me so much
you would have me be your whore ?

846
01:34:16,658 --> 01:34:19,409
For God's sake, I do this for us.

847
01:34:19,494 --> 01:34:22,411
I ask you to save some part of us !

848
01:34:22,497 --> 01:34:28,285
Lord Robert, you may make whores of my
Ladies but you shall not make one of me.

849
01:34:37,345 --> 01:34:39,384
Your Majesty.

850
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:49,935
Elizabeth is a witch !

851
01:34:50,899 --> 01:34:52,938
A witch !

852
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:56,356
And her servant is the devil !

853
01:35:12,169 --> 01:35:14,208
Get out ! Get out !

854
01:35:16,256 --> 01:35:18,711
Of course I shall deny it.

855
01:35:19,259 --> 01:35:24,882
Your Majesty must publicly dissociate
herself from this most bloody act.

856
01:35:24,973 --> 01:35:27,012
I never ordered it.

857
01:35:30,061 --> 01:35:32,516
Of course, Madam, of course.

858
01:35:32,605 --> 01:35:37,065
You must also make conciliatory gestures
towards the Spanish.

859
01:35:37,151 --> 01:35:41,444
Your dependence upon their goodwill
is greater than ever.

860
01:35:41,530 --> 01:35:45,029
- I must...
- The word "must" is not used to princes.

861
01:35:49,455 --> 01:35:54,615
I have followed your advice
in all the affairs of my kingdom, but

862
01:35:54,710 --> 01:36:00,000
your policies would make England
nothing but part of France or Spain.

863
01:36:02,342 --> 01:36:05,924
From this moment
I am going to follow my own opinion.

864
01:36:06,012 --> 01:36:09,261
Forgive me, Madam,
but you are only a woman.

865
01:36:09,349 --> 01:36:15,517
I may be a woman, Sir William, but
if I choose I have the heart of a man !

866
01:36:18,357 --> 01:36:20,729
I am my father's daughter.

867
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:23,975
I am not afraid of anything.

868
01:36:25,322 --> 01:36:27,148
I...

869
01:36:29,451 --> 01:36:34,611
I deeply regret, Madam,
if I have caused you such offence

870
01:36:35,415 --> 01:36:39,910
though God knows
all my advice has only ever been

871
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:45,168
to secure Your Majesty's throne.

872
01:36:45,591 --> 01:36:47,832
And I am grateful for it.

873
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:58,434
I have decided to create you
Lord Burghley,

874
01:36:58,520 --> 01:37:01,604
so you may enjoy your retirement
in greater ease.

875
01:37:01,690 --> 01:37:05,817
- Madam...
- That will be all, Lord Burghley.

876
01:37:13,243 --> 01:37:14,653
Majesty...

877
01:37:43,104 --> 01:37:45,143
Madam, if I may ?

878
01:37:46,441 --> 01:37:50,189
A prince should never flinch
from being blamed

879
01:37:50,278 --> 01:37:55,734
for acts of ruthlessness which are
necessary for safeguarding the State

880
01:37:55,825 --> 01:37:57,864
and their own person.

881
01:37:59,453 --> 01:38:04,909
You must take these things so much
to heart that you do not fear to strike

882
01:38:06,501 --> 01:38:09,585
even the very nearest that you have

883
01:38:10,797 --> 01:38:13,252
if they be implicated.

884
01:38:15,427 --> 01:38:17,466
It has been made known to me

885
01:38:17,554 --> 01:38:22,346
there is a priest abroad in the land,
carrying letters from Rome

886
01:38:22,433 --> 01:38:25,303
to those who mean to harm you.

887
01:38:28,481 --> 01:38:31,565
Norfolk's power in Court is growing.

888
01:38:31,650 --> 01:38:34,319
It is said that he and his foreign allies

889
01:38:34,403 --> 01:38:37,439
are raising an army
to outnumber your own.

890
01:38:37,531 --> 01:38:40,152
IfYour Majesty does not act soon

891
01:38:40,242 --> 01:38:42,281
then he will.

892
01:38:45,330 --> 01:38:49,244
Find the priest,
and those who harbour him.

893
01:38:50,543 --> 01:38:54,243
Right, search every room !
You two, upstairs !

894
01:39:05,224 --> 01:39:07,382
Where is Lord Arundel ?

895
01:39:10,938 --> 01:39:12,977
He's not here, sir.

896
01:39:23,032 --> 01:39:25,653
Do you know where your father is ?

897
01:40:12,288 --> 01:40:15,372
You were carrying letters from the Pope.

898
01:40:15,457 --> 01:40:18,126
To whom were you told to give them ?

899
01:40:29,137 --> 01:40:31,176
Tell me,

900
01:40:31,389 --> 01:40:33,630
what is God to you ?

901
01:40:35,893 --> 01:40:38,134
Has He abandoned you ?

902
01:40:38,688 --> 01:40:44,274
Is He such a worldly God that
He must play at politics and conspiracy ?

903
01:40:45,694 --> 01:40:47,935
Is He not divine ?

904
01:40:49,364 --> 01:40:54,109
Tell me the truth, as if you were
face to face with Him now.

905
01:40:58,248 --> 01:41:00,703
I am a patient man, Father.

906
01:41:13,471 --> 01:41:15,130
Sussex,

907
01:41:15,222 --> 01:41:16,965
Gardiner,

908
01:41:17,057 --> 01:41:18,800
Arundel.

909
01:41:18,892 --> 01:41:21,561
A man will confess to anything

910
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:24,804
under torture.

911
01:41:27,692 --> 01:41:31,191
And Lord Robert Dudley,
Earl of Leicester.

912
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:56,050
Madam, this document was also found
among the priest's possessions.

913
01:41:56,136 --> 01:42:01,046
From His Holiness the Pope
to His Grace the Duke of Norfolk.

914
01:42:04,019 --> 01:42:10,222
"To legitimise your claim to the throne
of England, His Holiness proposes

915
01:42:10,316 --> 01:42:14,609
"Your Grace should take as your bride
Mary, Queen of Scots,

916
01:42:14,695 --> 01:42:16,734
and overthrow Elizabeth..."

917
01:42:16,822 --> 01:42:20,071
The illegitimate and heretical whore

918
01:42:20,159 --> 01:42:22,696
who now sits upon the throne.

919
01:42:22,786 --> 01:42:29,583
All Norfolk need do is sign this paper,
and treason will have been committed.

920
01:42:31,962 --> 01:42:34,417
Then let him sign it.

921
01:42:36,299 --> 01:42:38,754
And let it all be done.

922
01:42:58,529 --> 01:43:00,568
In the future,

923
01:43:01,657 --> 01:43:05,072
when England is safe again and faithful,

924
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:09,987
they will thank me for this act
and forget the manner of it.

925
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:13,830
Is it not true ?

926
01:43:41,945 --> 01:43:44,518
Deliver this most carefully.

927
01:47:26,658 --> 01:47:29,148
What is the meaning of this ?

928
01:47:29,244 --> 01:47:33,905
Your Grace is arrested.
You must go with these men to the Tower.

929
01:47:33,999 --> 01:47:36,916
I must do nothing by your orders.
I am Norfolk.

930
01:47:37,001 --> 01:47:38,874
You were Norfolk.

931
01:47:40,964 --> 01:47:43,419
The dead have no titles.

932
01:47:52,099 --> 01:47:55,847
You were the most powerful man
in England

933
01:47:55,936 --> 01:47:59,139
and could have been greater still

934
01:47:59,231 --> 01:48:02,267
but you had not the courage to be loyal.

935
01:48:04,569 --> 01:48:08,317
Only the conviction of your own vanity.

936
01:48:08,406 --> 01:48:13,779
I think, Walsingham, a man's courage
is in the manner of his death.

937
01:48:15,121 --> 01:48:18,205
I am content to die for my beliefs.

938
01:48:19,876 --> 01:48:21,915
So cut off my head

939
01:48:22,712 --> 01:48:25,167
and make me a martyr.

940
01:48:25,881 --> 01:48:28,965
The people will always remember it.

941
01:48:29,968 --> 01:48:31,794
No...

942
01:48:33,347 --> 01:48:35,588
They will forget.

943
01:48:37,476 --> 01:48:39,515
Your Majesty

944
01:48:40,020 --> 01:48:42,059
knows that

945
01:48:42,188 --> 01:48:44,857
I did it only for my faith.

946
01:48:46,192 --> 01:48:48,231
Nothing more.

947
01:48:50,988 --> 01:48:54,487
All your many kindnesses
are remembered.

948
01:49:02,041 --> 01:49:06,168
You must not think
we care not for your children.

949
01:49:07,504 --> 01:49:10,789
Your Majesty is merciful and forgiving.

950
01:49:30,192 --> 01:49:32,647
What kept you, Walsingham ?

951
01:49:34,571 --> 01:49:36,610
I have been waiting.

952
01:49:50,086 --> 01:49:52,125
Your Majesty...

953
01:49:52,213 --> 01:49:54,786
They are all gone to the Tower.

954
01:49:54,882 --> 01:49:56,921
Your friends.

955
01:50:03,891 --> 01:50:05,930
Tell me,

956
01:50:08,437 --> 01:50:11,521
how should I serve thee, Robert ?

957
01:50:19,072 --> 01:50:21,313
My course is run.

958
01:50:24,035 --> 01:50:26,490
Just tell me why.

959
01:50:28,915 --> 01:50:30,954
Why ?

960
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:35,083
Madam,

961
01:50:39,008 --> 01:50:42,590
is it not plain enough to you ?

962
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:48,050
It is no easy thing to be loved

963
01:50:48,558 --> 01:50:50,799
by the Queen.

964
01:50:56,024 --> 01:50:59,108
It would corrupt the soul of any man.

965
01:51:02,363 --> 01:51:05,233
Now, for God's sake, kill me.

966
01:51:09,453 --> 01:51:11,492
No...

967
01:51:12,831 --> 01:51:15,535
I think rather to let you live.

968
01:51:15,626 --> 01:51:20,371
Madam, that is not wise.
Lord Robert has committed treason.

969
01:51:20,464 --> 01:51:25,624
- He must be made example of.
- And I will make an example of him.

970
01:51:31,307 --> 01:51:33,762
He shall be kept alive

971
01:51:35,853 --> 01:51:38,308
to always remind me

972
01:51:39,732 --> 01:51:42,816
of how close I came to danger.

973
01:52:44,001 --> 01:52:46,871
I have rid England of her enemies.

974
01:52:47,922 --> 01:52:50,377
What do I do now ?

975
01:52:50,674 --> 01:52:52,915
Am I to be made of stone ?

976
01:52:54,928 --> 01:52:57,383
Must I be touched by nothing ?

977
01:52:57,472 --> 01:53:00,009
Aye, Madam, to reign supreme.

978
01:53:02,102 --> 01:53:07,855
All men need something greater than
themselves to look up to and worship.

979
01:53:17,033 --> 01:53:20,318
They must be able to touch the divine

980
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:24,619
here on earth.

981
01:53:32,422 --> 01:53:35,506
She had such power over men's hearts.
