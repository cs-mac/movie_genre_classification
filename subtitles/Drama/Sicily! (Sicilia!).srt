00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,000
KU - FU
FROM SICILY WITH FURY ( Italian Title)

2
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:43,331
Bravo!
Show me the power of your strength.

3
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:46,132
Brake it with just one strike.

4
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,833
- But that's a tree.
- Do not argue my orders. Strike it!

5
00:03:04,234 --> 00:03:07,134
Remember the technique I tought you.

6
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:12,635
Power. Concentration.
Strike it. STRIKE IT!

7
00:03:19,836 --> 00:03:21,036
What a pity!

8
00:03:21,437 --> 00:03:25,037
For the fourtieth time
I witness this scene.

9
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,838
For an old man like me,
to fracture an arm, would be a disgrace.

10
00:03:28,839 --> 00:03:32,639
For you, it is a real disappointment.

11
00:03:32,955 --> 00:03:36,542
Chinese proverb, chapter 4,
section 11.

12
00:03:36,943 --> 00:03:41,043
Master... you always speak about China.

13
00:03:41,244 --> 00:03:43,744
- Why didn't you stay there?
- I wish!

14
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:47,745
They kicked me out
because I was smuggling rice.

15
00:03:48,746 --> 00:03:52,146
- From Beijing to Palermo?
- No, from Palermo to Beijing.

16
00:03:52,247 --> 00:03:54,247
- This way, you could earn more.
- Is that so?

17
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,748
Now, let's eat.

18
00:03:57,097 --> 00:04:01,014
Master,
why do I eat always vegetables?

19
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:04,015
Because you're young,
to keep in shape to fight.

20
00:04:04,016 --> 00:04:08,116
I am old, and to train you
I need to eat well.

21
00:04:08,117 --> 00:04:10,117
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

22
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:12,118
The fork picks up the spaghetti well.

23
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:18,619
- Can I taste the sauce?
- Just a little.

24
00:04:24,862 --> 00:04:26,878
Master, can I have a glass of wine.

25
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:30,679
- No, wine is bad for you. Water!
- Water?

26
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,680
- Water. Fresh springwater.
- From the pit.

27
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:52,244
- I won't come up here anymore.
- And how do I do without a car?

28
00:04:52,245 --> 00:04:53,745
- You're right.
- Sit down.

29
00:05:00,746 --> 00:05:02,946
- Important news.
- Important?

30
00:05:03,947 --> 00:05:06,947
- You must go to Rome.
- To Rome?

31
00:05:06,948 --> 00:05:07,948
Yes.

32
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:10,149
- The capital of China.
- Up to a point.

33
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:12,150
What I'm going to do to Rome?

34
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:17,851
I've learned that the Board of Rome
has a vacancy for traffic warden...

35
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,952
and they are organizing a tournament
of karate and kung fu.

36
00:05:21,053 --> 00:05:23,953
And the winner will fill the vacancy.

37
00:05:24,154 --> 00:05:26,954
You know who will be
the winner?

38
00:05:27,255 --> 00:05:28,755
- Will be you.
- Me?

39
00:05:28,956 --> 00:05:32,456
- Yes
- Me, is impossible.

40
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:36,557
I'll send a letter of recommendation
to my friend, Kon Ki Lay.

41
00:05:36,558 --> 00:05:39,158
- I do not know, Don Vitto.
- Kon Ki Lay.

42
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:44,159
- I do not know, word of honor.
- Kon Ki Lay is my friend.

43
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
He's the best instructor
of all the nipponian schools.

44
00:05:47,161 --> 00:05:50,261
I will ask him to help you
improve your technique.

45
00:05:50,262 --> 00:05:54,262
You will help me?
Give me this honor?

46
00:05:54,263 --> 00:05:56,263
- Exactly.
- Make me a champion?

47
00:05:56,264 --> 00:05:57,464
The biggest champion.

48
00:05:59,465 --> 00:06:05,465
This way, you fill the vacancy,
marry my daughter and take care of me.

49
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:10,466
Sorry Master,
I agree with what you say...

50
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,467
but I live alone for so many years...

51
00:06:13,468 --> 00:06:17,468
and never had the pleasure
to meet this girl.

52
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:18,469
Are you interested?

53
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,470
- Certainly.
- Are you 18?

54
00:06:20,471 --> 00:06:22,771
- A bit more.
- Here is the picture.

55
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:27,772
It is an erotic photography,
but innocent indeed.

56
00:06:27,773 --> 00:06:30,573
But this is Leonarda!

57
00:06:30,574 --> 00:06:34,874
She is 18 years.
The photo is a bit old, but...

58
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:42,375
I'm proud.
I'll be back a winner.

59
00:06:42,376 --> 00:06:45,376
This will be my wife.
I'll defend her from all dangers.

60
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:49,277
Dragons, dinosaurs.
I'll fight against all.

61
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,128
No one will touch her.

62
00:06:52,137 --> 00:06:53,214
Leave her alone!

63
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:02,813
KON KI LAY
SCHOOL OF MARTIAL ARTS

64
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,615
Moron, look where you're going.
You smashed my brand new little car.

65
00:08:15,616 --> 00:08:20,616
I'll kill you. I'll flay you, damn.
Asshole.

66
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:27,617
See what you did? Do you understand?
I'll make you just a hole, asshole.

67
00:08:27,618 --> 00:08:32,618
You smashed my new little car.
Thank God. I will not forget.

68
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:38,619
Sorry, I did not see you.

69
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,020
Big jackass!

70
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,520
Pardon me, gentlemen.

71
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:29,021
Gentlemen,
beware of the wall!

72
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,458
I've seen you practicing.

73
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:16,259
You know the winner of the tournament
will fill the traffic vacancy in Rome.

74
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:20,260
If you continue like this,
none of you will win.

75
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:23,461
Do you want to win it or not?
- YES.

76
00:10:23,762 --> 00:10:26,262
How so?
- No.

77
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:30,063
- NO!!
- Bravo Maramaldo, that's the way.

78
00:10:30,864 --> 00:10:32,364
Your adversaries...

79
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,265
will use all the
tricks available...

80
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,266
I mean...

81
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:39,367
to win...

82
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:42,068
- is that what you want?
- YES!!

83
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:43,569
How so?
- NO!

84
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,070
- Who are you?
- "SHA KI."

85
00:10:59,071 --> 00:11:00,071
"SHA KI"

86
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,272
"NAGAGE SHA KI"

87
00:11:07,397 --> 00:11:09,788
Stand up my son.

88
00:11:10,789 --> 00:11:14,789
- "SHA KE NAGAGE."
- Yes.

89
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,790
- Who are you?
- I'm sent by Don Vitto.

90
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,591
- Who is he?
- The big shot of Sicily.

91
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:24,092
What does he want?

92
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,693
A letter for you.

93
00:11:36,094 --> 00:11:37,494
Maramaldo read it.

94
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,301
- You're a tough one.
- Modesty aside.

95
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:49,002
- Are you strong?
- Yes.

96
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:53,177
What then are you here for?

97
00:11:57,178 --> 00:11:59,378
Maramaldo,
teach him a lesson.

98
00:12:41,975 --> 00:12:45,329
Very well.
You're in the place you're looking for.

99
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,530
For the police vacancy,
you'll have to prove you're worth.

100
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:08,831
Ma'am... have you asked already?
What is your specialty?

101
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:14,932
Everything that is Chinese.
Earthworms, mashed ants, beetle sauce.

102
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:16,069
Roasted dog.

103
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,013
Cockroach white soup.

104
00:13:18,434 --> 00:13:22,034
- It makes my stomach sick.
- Is there something lighter?

105
00:13:22,035 --> 00:13:25,035
Want something lighter?
- Yes, two doses.

106
00:13:25,036 --> 00:13:28,336
- Yes undercooked.
- Want undercooked?

107
00:13:29,337 --> 00:13:31,037
They have everything hidden inside.

108
00:13:31,038 --> 00:13:33,338
Two doses of locusts
to table 4.

109
00:13:34,339 --> 00:13:36,889
Here, stir this.

110
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,468
Tastes better this way.

111
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,610
Here is the champion.

112
00:13:52,611 --> 00:13:54,924
I was a great champion.

113
00:13:54,925 --> 00:13:56,353
in the art of Kung Fu...

114
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:59,371
and also Fu Manchu,
and everything else.

115
00:13:59,372 --> 00:14:01,571
Abebe,the local striker,
bang, bang...

116
00:14:01,572 --> 00:14:05,504
- You're a buffoon.
- No, he's not a buffoon.

117
00:14:05,505 --> 00:14:08,031
He was a rising promise.
Used to show such powerful strikes...

118
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,965
up to the day he got mad
and wanted to destroy the Pisa Tower.

119
00:14:11,132 --> 00:14:15,177
- The Pisa Tower? -
Yes. He kept striking it, bang, bang...

120
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:17,022
with all that fat
jumping up and down.

121
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:22,148
There he goes, the strongest of all,
watch out Europe...

122
00:14:27,565 --> 00:14:31,153
Sit there and wait. I'll talk
to the owner to get you a place to sleep.

123
00:14:33,154 --> 00:14:37,354
What a cozy Chinese restaurant.

124
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:45,355
- Sir, are you eating?
- Yes, what is the specialty?

125
00:14:46,031 --> 00:14:49,305
- Earthworms, mashed ants,
- No, no.

126
00:14:51,006 --> 00:14:54,606
- Beetle sauce.
- No. Thank you.

127
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:56,607
- Roasted dog.
- No.

128
00:14:56,808 --> 00:14:59,808
- Cockroach white soup.
- No, no. Absolutely not.

129
00:14:59,909 --> 00:15:03,209
- Chinese specialty
- Yes, that yes.

130
00:15:18,522 --> 00:15:20,218
Sir, enjoy it.

131
00:15:51,219 --> 00:15:52,219
Waiter.

132
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:00,220
- How can I help you, Sir? Like it?
- Immense.

133
00:16:00,521 --> 00:16:03,821
- Get me another.
- Want another specialty?

134
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:05,022
- Italian, please.
- Yes sir.

135
00:16:05,023 --> 00:16:07,223
Alright.
Bring me Italian pasta.

136
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:25,224
- Forgive me... want to eat in peace?
- What, looking for war?

137
00:16:25,225 --> 00:16:27,833
- Why are you touching the girl?
- Because she is good.

138
00:16:30,434 --> 00:16:32,017
I did not like the shirt.

139
00:16:36,434 --> 00:16:38,574
- Here is your plate.
- Bring me a drink. - Yes sir.

140
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:26,224
Now, I'll sing a song
from Northern China.

141
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:31,225
It is the drama of a woman
abandoned by her husband.

142
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,226
And her enormous pain.

143
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:53,382
Bravo

144
00:17:59,271 --> 00:18:05,468
This time since you've liked it,
I'll sing another song.

145
00:18:05,469 --> 00:18:10,469
"Pendriosa."
An allusion to spring.

146
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,957
To the nature that surrounds us
and we sometimes mistreat.

147
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:41,264
And now, to the gentle request...

148
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:45,187
I'll sing a melancholy song...

149
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,718
- Get ready.
- Yes.

150
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:53,429
which portrays the drama of a seller,
watching the cutting of her husband's leg

151
00:19:17,672 --> 00:19:19,872
Now, another song.

152
00:19:24,873 --> 00:19:27,318
If it keeps this way
we'll get enough for tomorrow.

153
00:19:27,319 --> 00:19:31,219
- Yeah, but it is best to walk.
- Walk, nothing. Okay, let's go.

154
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,534
Enough.
Bring that poor to drink something.

155
00:19:37,935 --> 00:19:40,403
Come on,
the boss wants to talk to you.

156
00:19:41,936 --> 00:19:42,999
Stop!

157
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:24,613
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

158
00:20:25,614 --> 00:20:27,234
- Attila.
- The scourge of God.

159
00:20:29,035 --> 00:20:31,180
- Everyone fears me wherever I go.
- Not everyone!

160
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:33,392
- It is racy, the fool.
- So it seems.

161
00:20:33,393 --> 00:20:35,116
- You know who I am?
- No.

162
00:20:35,117 --> 00:20:38,613
I'm Franco.
Known as "The Prickly Pear."

163
00:20:38,614 --> 00:20:41,661
- And what do you do?
- I'll show you...

164
00:20:41,962 --> 00:20:43,621
if you touch me in the wound.

165
00:20:45,722 --> 00:20:48,660
I belong to the school of
Master Kon Ki Lay.

166
00:20:48,861 --> 00:20:52,227
I arrived this morning on the ferry.

167
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:57,407
- We have a champion here, guys.
- Modesty aside.

168
00:20:57,408 --> 00:21:01,488
He is from Master Ki Kon Lay's school.
Now you have a worthy opponent.

169
00:21:17,489 --> 00:21:18,730
We put a bit of salt.

170
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:23,026
A bit of lettuce,
comes in handy.

171
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:25,780
Then add pepper.

172
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,451
A bit of olive oil.

173
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:38,576
It is my hand!

174
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:40,324
Goddamn you!

175
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:45,005
Boys, put him to fly.

176
00:21:54,406 --> 00:21:55,882
Misfortunes never come alone.

177
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:10,106
My children,
this place is very special...

178
00:22:10,107 --> 00:22:13,433
that we can not change it.

179
00:22:13,434 --> 00:22:16,782
My daughter loves the bar so much...

180
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:18,778
that I tolerate a lot.

181
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:24,739
- But when someone causes disorders,
I want to know. - And why?

182
00:22:24,774 --> 00:22:27,852
So I can beat them up!

183
00:22:31,845 --> 00:22:35,396
Bravo!
Superb!

184
00:22:35,697 --> 00:22:37,897
Allow me to congratulate you.

185
00:22:38,898 --> 00:22:43,898
Bravo! Spectacular.
What a headbutt.

186
00:22:43,899 --> 00:22:47,299
I know hard heads,
but yours,

187
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,200
is an authentic weapon, powerful,
worthy of you.

188
00:22:55,201 --> 00:22:57,201
- My congratulations.
- Thank you.

189
00:22:57,202 --> 00:22:59,602
- You're welcome.
- Where did you get in from?

190
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:02,603
- Through there.
- Through there?

191
00:23:02,604 --> 00:23:03,904
- Yes
- Of course.

192
00:23:05,905 --> 00:23:06,905
What do you do?

193
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:48,426
Do you like where you sleep.
It is close to mine.

194
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,745
Yes, I do.
I'm just not happy with your father.

195
00:23:52,746 --> 00:23:54,746
Kekkorr Captive.

196
00:23:54,747 --> 00:23:57,462
No. Kekkorr Nocaptive.

197
00:23:57,463 --> 00:24:02,463
He makes no distinctions.
Captive worker, fair, unfair...

198
00:24:02,564 --> 00:24:05,464
and then sends everyone away.

199
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:07,965
I find a strange name.
"Kekkorr."

200
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:14,066
No, Ke Colonel.
It's the surname.

201
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:17,567
- The other is the name.
- Oh, Ke Cuckold?

202
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:22,568
But I like his name.
Ke Cuckold.

203
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:25,569
Look, another school.
Who will it belong to?

204
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,370
This is the school of Lho Kon Te.

205
00:24:28,371 --> 00:24:33,371
It is attended by the evil ones
that ruined my show.

206
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:38,872
It should be big-shots.
Look at the letters, what do they mean?

207
00:24:38,373 --> 00:24:42,173
I means: we are the best.

208
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,174
Attention!

209
00:24:50,658 --> 00:24:52,394
You're a bunch of cowards.

210
00:24:52,395 --> 00:24:55,395
What a great show you put out.

211
00:24:55,396 --> 00:24:58,796
- We have to win at any cost.
- We will.

212
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:04,157
This is a speech,
not a two way conversation.

213
00:25:05,331 --> 00:25:07,533
Listen carefully.

214
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:13,534
That police vacancy
must be ours.

215
00:25:16,035 --> 00:25:19,035
It is a position
of great importance.

216
00:25:18,957 --> 00:25:23,844
Whoever holds it
will be the master of Rome.

217
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,845
Thus,
we have to win the tournament.

218
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:35,746
But we have to be careful.

219
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:45,747
We have to study the opponent.
Find a weak spot.

220
00:25:48,332 --> 00:25:53,643
And find out everything
that goes on Kon Ki Lay's school.

221
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:58,995
Do you know anyone there,
that can be our spy.

222
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,245
Yes, a certain Aldo Marama.

223
00:26:03,046 --> 00:26:09,046
- Maramaldo
- Yes, a treacherous, jealous guy.

224
00:26:10,452 --> 00:26:15,250
Very well.
Bribe him! Hire him!

225
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:18,386
And to get everything in order...

226
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:23,387
I will have sent from Milan,
three killers, friends of mine.

227
00:26:25,388 --> 00:26:26,470
Ki Kaka Mai,

228
00:26:27,471 --> 00:26:28,529
Tutti Li Tui

229
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:29,935
Va A Fan,

230
00:26:30,936 --> 00:26:34,629
- But these are professional killers.
- That's right.

231
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,022
This way we can eliminate
all the men of Ki Kon Lay.

232
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:01,738
- My God, Mary! Who are they, moroccans?
- I wish, we'll see what they want.

233
00:27:42,739 --> 00:27:44,405
1500 lire.

234
00:27:47,406 --> 00:27:49,828
Help.
Bandits on the loose.

235
00:28:08,406 --> 00:28:10,264
Great idea
to pretend to be...

236
00:28:10,265 --> 00:28:11,398
turists.

237
00:28:41,582 --> 00:28:43,787
Today I will show you...

238
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:45,857
how to fight Kung-Fu.

239
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,692
The deadly struggle.

240
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:52,162
- The unforgiving. Give me your hand.
- Ooooh!

241
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:53,963
Quiet!

242
00:28:56,627 --> 00:28:57,864
- Ear
- Ooooh!

243
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:01,255
Quiet!

244
00:29:02,256 --> 00:29:03,256
The eyes.

245
00:29:04,257 --> 00:29:07,175
- Ooooh!
- Quiet!

246
00:29:08,176 --> 00:29:09,176
I see nothing.

247
00:29:10,177 --> 00:29:13,477
What the eyes can't seen,
the heart can't feel.

248
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,053
The samurai.

249
00:29:35,054 --> 00:29:36,554
What do you want here?

250
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:38,555
Who are you?

251
00:29:38,556 --> 00:29:44,094
- Ki Kaka Mai,
- The Deaf.

252
00:29:44,095 --> 00:29:46,488
- Tutti Li Tui.
- The Mute.

253
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:52,558
- The Fan Van.
- The Blind-dust.

254
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,434
Out of my school.

255
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:00,601
Oh my God!

256
00:30:00,602 --> 00:30:03,002
Help me!

257
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:06,002
Get ready to fight!

258
00:30:07,003 --> 00:30:09,003
Attack!

259
00:32:21,004 --> 00:32:22,651
Go Maramaldo

260
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:35,341
Poor Maramaldo.

261
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:43,320
Go!

262
00:32:46,289 --> 00:32:48,778
- I do not I fight.
- Use the Kung-Fu.

263
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:50,579
Do not insist.

264
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,880
- Aren't you brave?
- Yes, I am.

265
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:58,108
- Then, go.
- No! I'm against violence.

266
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:03,335
Get out of here!

267
00:33:16,336 --> 00:33:19,536
Coward.
See what they did to Maramaldo.

268
00:33:19,637 --> 00:33:25,037
- Get out, traitor!
- Have mercy.

269
00:33:25,138 --> 00:33:27,238
You do not have guts
for martial arts.

270
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:57,239
Moron! You again.
Don't you see where you're going.

271
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:01,240
You smashed into
my new little car again.

272
00:34:01,841 --> 00:34:06,241
Fortunately I have insurance.
If I grab you, I smash your head.

273
00:34:06,342 --> 00:34:10,242
You're lucky I'm calm.
You jerk.

274
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:13,943
Be calm, be calm.
Go slow!

275
00:34:21,844 --> 00:34:23,644
- What do you want?
- Beer.

276
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:26,645
Beer.

277
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:28,746
Beer.

278
00:35:39,747 --> 00:35:41,147
Beer.

279
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:02,340
Three beers.

280
00:38:16,541 --> 00:38:18,153
- How much beer do you have?
A lot.

281
00:38:18,154 --> 00:38:19,426
One box.

282
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:20,791
Two boxes.

283
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:21,956
Three boxes.

284
00:39:30,557 --> 00:39:32,144
My poor luck.

285
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:37,067
- You again.
- I didn't mean to...

286
00:39:49,068 --> 00:39:50,280
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

287
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:54,889
That's what I thought.
Very clever, bravo, bravo.

288
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,834
It's amazing what a few beers
can do, isn't it?

289
00:39:58,835 --> 00:40:04,166
Just that sometimes we do things
we shouldn't. Come a bit closer.

290
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:12,944
No! Not me.

291
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:17,273
I have a headache.

292
00:40:18,474 --> 00:40:19,906
I beg you, I beg you.

293
00:40:21,207 --> 00:40:22,591
I have a headache.

294
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:25,350
Headache.

295
00:40:25,351 --> 00:40:29,265
- Where, where?
- Here, at the side of the head.

296
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:31,346
- At the side of the head.
-Let me see.

297
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:45,027
The secret of karate...

298
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,780
lies in the close relationship...

299
00:40:47,981 --> 00:40:51,798
with the philosophy of life and
their continuous improvement.

300
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,042
SemPo Kojo.

301
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:06,530
Ju Jutsu.

302
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:09,563
Kung Fu.

303
00:41:10,864 --> 00:41:12,899
What will it be, a Chinese fungus?

304
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,240
What the hell is this chapter about?

305
00:41:29,541 --> 00:41:31,080
May I come in?

306
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:36,632
What is it?
What the hell of a manner to get in?

307
00:41:37,633 --> 00:41:41,088
Sorry master, got distracted and the fist
took more power than I predicted.

308
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:44,745
I didn't like what you did.
Go away! Go away!

309
00:41:53,746 --> 00:41:56,237
And I had so much faith in you.

310
00:41:56,038 --> 00:41:57,401
And you what do you do?

311
00:41:57,402 --> 00:42:02,067
- You contribute to that disaster.
- Master, I want to redeem myself.

312
00:42:02,068 --> 00:42:05,831
- Why? - I won't let
an old man to be humiliated..

313
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,251
as well as his fellow pupils.

314
00:42:09,952 --> 00:42:12,206
- Who is the old man?
- It is the master.

315
00:42:12,207 --> 00:42:15,254
I?
I'm not even a centenarian.

316
00:42:15,255 --> 00:42:20,837
- Forgive me.
- I'm near, 97, 96, 95.

317
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,614
- You have a great appearance.
- Yes, yes.

318
00:42:24,615 --> 00:42:28,380
- You know why?
- A special diet?

319
00:42:28,681 --> 00:42:29,683
No.

320
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:32,645
A specific treatment.

321
00:42:34,646 --> 00:42:35,755
What could it be?

322
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:41,193
Because I follow the strict rules...

323
00:42:42,361 --> 00:42:43,641
of a guide book.

324
00:42:46,676 --> 00:42:49,641
- A last "bieta"
- And as such...

325
00:42:49,742 --> 00:42:53,888
- I'm going to reveal you a secret.
- Thank you Master.

326
00:42:54,089 --> 00:42:55,438
That'll be very helpful.

327
00:42:56,939 --> 00:42:58,439
Kiss my hand,
not yours.

328
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,684
Do you know what is Kung Fu?

329
00:43:02,777 --> 00:43:05,742
Sure.
We eat it all the time in Sicily.

330
00:43:05,743 --> 00:43:07,900
- What?
- "Che stato."

331
00:43:08,901 --> 00:43:11,949
- How "Che stato?"
- Ku fu is "Che stato."

332
00:43:12,184 --> 00:43:13,745
- What is ku fu?
- It's the same thing.

333
00:43:13,846 --> 00:43:14,992
Kung Fu!

334
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,408
- In Chinese dialect.
- You got it spot on.

335
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:23,014
- It is a defensive and offensive
millenial art. - Millenial?

336
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:26,537
Keep it in mind.
I'll teach it to you.

337
00:43:26,638 --> 00:43:28,331
- Thank you.
- And more...

338
00:43:28,632 --> 00:43:29,966
Kiss mine.

339
00:43:30,967 --> 00:43:32,800
And another thing
I want to tell you.

340
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,690
- Yes
- Take a look around...

341
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:38,648
- to see if anyone is listening to us.
- Leave it to me.

342
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:51,763
Tiki, tiki, tiki, te,
unstoppable in karate.

343
00:43:51,764 --> 00:43:55,302
Tiki,tiki,tiki, two,
unstoppable in Kung Fu.

344
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:06,046
- Nobody around.
- Listen.

345
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:12,027
- I'll tell you something nobody knows.
- Nobody?

346
00:44:12,028 --> 00:44:15,311
I'll make you
an invincible man.

347
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:18,426
A very strong man.

348
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:20,427
- An unbeatable man.
- Unbeatable?

349
00:44:20,428 --> 00:44:23,028
- A superman.
- Like Flash Gordon?

350
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:24,002
Stronger.

351
00:44:24,003 --> 00:44:26,056
- Like Batman?
- Stronger.

352
00:44:27,057 --> 00:44:29,897
I got it.
Like the member kitt.

353
00:44:29,898 --> 00:44:32,964
- Much stronger. This one is nothing.
- Nothing?

354
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:38,356
You'll possess the power of the
" Hand of Travertine."

355
00:44:38,357 --> 00:44:42,268
- The " Hand of Travertine?"
- But you can only use it...

356
00:44:43,269 --> 00:44:46,772
for sports, not for personal use.

357
00:44:47,173 --> 00:44:49,381
- Remember that.
- I swear.

358
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:56,109
Come in.

359
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,394
Are they for me?

360
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:07,724
- Yes.
- Thank you.

361
00:45:17,961 --> 00:45:21,078
You know,
I won't send you away anymore.

362
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:23,869
I have always been alone.

363
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:28,529
Getting hit by tomatoes, potatoes,
eggs, waiting for him to come...

364
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:31,216
- to give love.
- Yes, I understand.

365
00:45:31,217 --> 00:45:34,355
A young woman can not live like this.

366
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,546
- I'll help you.
- Thank you.

367
00:45:37,547 --> 00:45:40,068
-Are you happy?
- Yes.

368
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:42,355
Letter from the fiancée?

369
00:45:42,356 --> 00:45:46,399
No, poor thing,
she can't read nor write.

370
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,348
She is illiterate.

371
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:52,621
Well, to a certain extent.

372
00:45:52,822 --> 00:45:56,833
You are right.
Let me show you something.

373
00:46:02,564 --> 00:46:05,483
Here it is.
I have her always with me.

374
00:46:05,578 --> 00:46:07,647
- Is it your daughter?
- No, it's my fiancée.

375
00:46:07,748 --> 00:46:10,840
- She's a little baby.
- She was a little baby.

376
00:46:10,841 --> 00:46:12,909
But it's been so many years.

377
00:46:12,910 --> 00:46:15,697
It's like anything, a land that
if not taken care of...

378
00:46:15,698 --> 00:46:18,817
only grows grass, you know?
Do you like her?

379
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,758
Do you want me
to tell you something?

380
00:46:20,759 --> 00:46:22,291
I don't care.

381
00:46:22,292 --> 00:46:24,583
I'm happy for you.

382
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:29,244
- And you, why are you happy?
- I'm happy because I have a secret.

383
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:32,790
- A secret?
- Yes, but I can not tell anyone.

384
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:36,787
So, you think I'm a nobody.

385
00:46:36,788 --> 00:46:38,534
Well, I did not want to offend you.

386
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:43,925
You are, soul, body, mind, fire.
You're everything to me.

387
00:46:44,926 --> 00:46:46,589
But it's a secret.

388
00:46:46,590 --> 00:46:48,496
- So, tell me!
- If I tell you,

389
00:46:48,797 --> 00:46:50,676
- you won't tell anyone?
- No. - Do you swear?

390
00:46:51,677 --> 00:46:54,847
- What is it?
- It is a Chinese oath.

391
00:46:55,848 --> 00:46:58,130
- And this, what is it?
- It's a Sicilian oath.

392
00:46:58,131 --> 00:47:03,227
In fact, it is a Neapolitan oath,
a song from a certain Franco Rizzo.

393
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:05,380
- Tell me.
- It's like this.

394
00:47:05,581 --> 00:47:08,709
- My master Kon Ki Lay...
- Your master Kon Ki Lay...

395
00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:11,787
- revealed to me...
- revealed to you...

396
00:47:12,388 --> 00:47:15,307
- the secret...
- the secret...

397
00:47:15,508 --> 00:47:19,835
- of the "Hand of Travertine."
- of the "Hand of Travertine."

398
00:47:21,836 --> 00:47:23,836
- And who is he?
- He is...

399
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:17,877
Master Lho Kon Te?

400
00:48:26,078 --> 00:48:27,568
Master Lho Kon Te?

401
00:48:36,769 --> 00:48:39,041
Where is
Master Lho Kon Te?

402
00:48:47,642 --> 00:48:53,440
I have something important to tell
Master Lho Kon Te.

403
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,015
What is this?

404
00:49:09,016 --> 00:49:11,159
- What is going on here?
- Master...

405
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,834
I have something important
to tell you.

406
00:49:13,835 --> 00:49:18,819
Master Kon Ki Lay is teaching
Franco, a secret from Ancient China.

407
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,820
The "Hand of Travertine."

408
00:49:20,821 --> 00:49:24,095
- From Ancient China?
The "Hand of Travertine?"  - Yes.

409
00:49:32,096 --> 00:49:35,929
- Who is this Franco?
-It's the new pupil of Master Kon Ki Lay.

410
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:40,969
- Can this Franco, win the tournament?
- Yes.

411
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:47,389
- And why do you betray your master?
- Because I was the favorite...

412
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:51,551
The bravest of all. I Beat them all,
but with the arrival of this Franco...

413
00:49:51,552 --> 00:49:56,082
Now, everybody beat me,
everybody...

414
00:49:56,083 --> 00:50:00,971
Bravo. You have a
great sense of honor.

415
00:50:00,972 --> 00:50:05,708
This vengeful heart of yours
will...

416
00:50:05,709 --> 00:50:11,322
kill you.
May my hand be with you.

417
00:50:13,023 --> 00:50:14,323
Thank you master.

418
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,034
- You're new around here?
- Yes, I'm passing by.

419
00:50:27,035 --> 00:50:30,737
- I'm mr. Strozzi, the store owner.
- Nice to meet you.

420
00:50:30,738 --> 00:50:33,314
- Do you practice Karate or Kung Fu?
- Karate.

421
00:50:33,715 --> 00:50:35,775
We have everything for karate.

422
00:50:38,176 --> 00:50:40,877
We have everything for the sport
and the best.

423
00:50:40,878 --> 00:50:43,978
See, Karate Gi's.

424
00:50:43,979 --> 00:50:46,800
Anything you want.

425
00:50:46,801 --> 00:50:49,290
- You're right but...

426
00:50:49,691 --> 00:50:53,185
We are here to serve you.
See, this here.

427
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,391
An ancient mask.
See, what a beauty.

428
00:50:57,392 --> 00:51:00,971
- Very well.
- And this, so beautiful.

429
00:51:00,972 --> 00:51:04,065
- I mean ...
- See this.

430
00:51:04,966 --> 00:51:09,913
- A hand bag.
- I can not buy anything because...

431
00:51:09,948 --> 00:51:12,453
- I have no money.
- No problem.

432
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:14,827
We sell on credit.
Let us note in the book.

433
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:21,843
Monthly, okay?
Let's start with the date.

434
00:51:23,738 --> 00:51:29,218
Rome, May 29,
and the rest, we'll write later.

435
00:51:33,283 --> 00:51:36,940
Thank you. Come again.
Goodbye.

436
00:51:48,841 --> 00:51:52,009
- What a beautiful place. Magnificent.
- I brought you here...

437
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,753
- for you to practice in secret.
- Thank you, master.

438
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:57,264
No one must know.

439
00:51:59,265 --> 00:52:02,002
Today we start with the exercise
of our mentor.

440
00:52:02,003 --> 00:52:04,105
- Yes, of course.
- My father.

441
00:52:04,106 --> 00:52:06,235
- From your father.
- From now on...

442
00:52:07,936 --> 00:52:10,149
have a deep breath,
breathe.

443
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:13,125
What is it?

444
00:52:13,126 --> 00:52:16,912
- I'm choking.
-You have to get used to this air.

445
00:52:16,913 --> 00:52:21,260
- This air.
-Look around. Here we don't see a soul.

446
00:52:21,961 --> 00:52:24,425
Today we start practicing.

447
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:33,020
Come, come.
Lower.

448
00:52:35,021 --> 00:52:40,960
- Master, it is heavy.
- What heavy. It is your impression.

449
00:52:40,961 --> 00:52:43,701
- My impression?
- Come, come.

450
00:52:43,902 --> 00:52:47,609
- Until that house.
- That's  3 kilometers.

451
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:54,532
- This is to strengthen the muscles.
- They are hard as rocks.

452
00:52:54,533 --> 00:52:58,199
Rocks what?
Keep going.

453
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:01,698
- Be strong?
- Come on,  come on.

454
00:53:01,699 --> 00:53:04,348
- Come on.
- We are arriving

455
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:07,622
You showed your strength.

456
00:53:08,623 --> 00:53:12,815
Put it here. Here.

457
00:53:14,516 --> 00:53:18,116
Slowly. Inside
are my best clothes.

458
00:53:18,117 --> 00:53:21,228
- Slowly, slowly.
- I can't anymore!

459
00:53:22,229 --> 00:53:24,229
Bravo, my son!

460
00:53:43,408 --> 00:53:48,310
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing? Get up!

461
00:53:48,311 --> 00:53:51,422
- Get up!
- I have no strength.

462
00:54:10,423 --> 00:54:15,652
Bravo. It's enough.
You did a great job today.

463
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:20,383
- Following the tradition of our father...
- Master kon Ki Lay.

464
00:54:20,384 --> 00:54:25,229
- Do you want me to bring the furniture?
- No, no.

465
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:31,511
- I don't need. I'll do everything. Go.
- He's a miser, let's go.

466
00:54:36,512 --> 00:54:39,123
- We spoke of...
- Of your father.

467
00:54:39,124 --> 00:54:41,242
- Of course. My father.
- Yes.

468
00:54:41,243 --> 00:54:45,028
- The master had many parents?
- Yes, many.

469
00:54:45,029 --> 00:54:47,410
- And mothers?
- Ah, mothers, only one.

470
00:54:56,411 --> 00:55:01,363
This will be the first training
to strengthen the hand.

471
00:55:01,364 --> 00:55:04,732
- These ones!
- We start like this.

472
00:55:04,733 --> 00:55:09,145
Pay attention.
Put your hands in there like this.

473
00:55:09,146 --> 00:55:12,738
I have to put my hands
inside this hot cauldron?

474
00:55:12,739 --> 00:55:16,960
- But, master, I'm afraid.
- What the hell of Chinese are you?

475
00:55:16,961 --> 00:55:19,963
- It's burning hot!
- See as I do!

476
00:55:21,964 --> 00:55:26,326
I have long sleeves.
You try.

477
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:29,521
- You want me to try with my hands?
- Yes, with your hands.

478
00:55:33,522 --> 00:55:35,652
- With all the strength?
- Yes.

479
00:55:35,653 --> 00:55:37,920
- More than once.
- Yes.

480
00:55:38,921 --> 00:55:42,506
Sant Rosaly, I promise...

481
00:55:47,507 --> 00:55:49,907
Very well. Bravo!

482
00:55:53,908 --> 00:55:55,908
Come on! Come on!

483
00:55:59,909 --> 00:56:04,093
Today, we'll start the hardest part
of your training

484
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:07,986
It is the "Hand of Travertine."

485
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:12,328
- Master, can't we skip
the "Travertine" training? - No, no!

486
00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:16,400
- I failed the Kung-Fu lessons.
- That's not true.

487
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:18,490
I am the instructor here.

488
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:22,312
And I think you'll do very well.

489
00:56:22,313 --> 00:56:25,596
- You think? - Sure.
You'll see, everything will be alright.

490
00:56:25,597 --> 00:56:29,134
- If you think?
- Listen to me.

491
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:32,565
You should hit the wall
with the bottom of the hand...

492
00:56:32,794 --> 00:56:37,329
to strengthen it,
in this way.

493
00:56:38,330 --> 00:56:41,923
- A quick swipe.
- Exactly.

494
00:56:42,924 --> 00:56:44,527
On the wall.

495
00:56:44,924 --> 00:56:49,408
First lightly, then harder
and finally with full force.

496
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,758
- If I got ir right, with bottom of hand.
- Yes.

497
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:56,079
- But I fracture the arm.
- No.

498
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:01,808
It is to strengthen it.
I'll show you. See!

499
00:57:06,809 --> 00:57:10,809
But why should I do it?
It's you who should show courage.

500
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:14,920
- You're the one who must do it.
- Me? - Ready? Go for it!

501
00:57:22,921 --> 00:57:25,927
Guys, the house was fully
destroyed.

502
00:57:25,928 --> 00:57:28,762
Wait a minute
I'll check it out.

503
00:57:31,763 --> 00:57:34,438
Hey, don't you go with Mr. Rodrigo?

504
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:35,939
What a disgrace!

505
00:57:37,783 --> 00:57:39,459
Guys, someone was
down there.

506
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,460
Let's get out of here.
Quickly.

507
00:57:40,461 --> 00:57:43,548
I told you to check before.

508
00:57:46,549 --> 00:57:49,302
Fantastic.
How did you do it?

509
00:57:50,303 --> 00:57:51,829
That's amazing.

510
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:59,253
You've got invincible power.
I'm proud of you, you know?

511
00:58:29,254 --> 00:58:33,486
- It was Maramaldo. - Yes
- He has no hands!

512
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:37,404
What does he wants his hands for?

513
00:58:39,488 --> 00:58:41,177
My hands?

514
00:58:48,178 --> 00:58:52,027
Stop! Do not move,
or else you're dead.

515
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:56,751
If it's a kidnapping, you got the
wrong person because I haven't a nickel.

516
00:58:56,752 --> 00:58:59,200
It's not a kidnapping. You're coming
with us. It is an invitation.

517
00:58:59,415 --> 00:59:03,522
An invitation with two knives
pointed to Franco.

518
00:59:04,423 --> 00:59:08,040
- Okay, where do you take me?
- You don't need to know.

519
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,742
- Who invites me?
- You don't need to know.

520
00:59:09,743 --> 00:59:12,583
- You don't need.
Get in, get in.

521
00:59:12,784 --> 00:59:16,273
Okay, without shouting.
I told it was a kidnapping.

522
00:59:20,274 --> 00:59:21,839
Thank you.

523
01:00:15,394 --> 01:00:18,105
Remember, you will only use
the "Hand of Travertine"...

524
01:00:18,155 --> 01:00:23,454
for sport activities and not
for personal matters.

525
01:00:24,607 --> 01:00:25,955
Come closer.

526
01:00:31,855 --> 01:00:33,560
Sit down please.

527
01:01:17,561 --> 01:01:21,467
- Do you know where you are?
- Of course I do.

528
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:24,565
In the school of a big shot.

529
01:01:25,566 --> 01:01:31,014
- And do you know who I am?
- Of course I do. Master Lho Kon Te.

530
01:01:31,015 --> 01:01:36,910
And you are not afraid?
- No. Why should I?

531
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:40,087
- Do you know why I brought you here?
- No.

532
01:01:41,088 --> 01:01:45,344
- To make you a proposal.
- A proposal?

533
01:01:45,345 --> 01:01:46,738
- Yes
- What kind?

534
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:53,161
Simple. In the next tournament
you'll fight for my school.

535
01:01:53,162 --> 01:01:56,223
- Do you accept?
- No.

536
01:01:56,224 --> 01:02:00,385
- Why not? Because I won't betray
master Kon Ki Lay.

537
01:02:01,386 --> 01:02:07,667
- Besides...
- Oh, I forgot.

538
01:02:08,533 --> 01:02:12,541
the 'Hand of Travertine?"
You know what we'll do with his hand?

539
01:02:12,542 --> 01:02:14,643
The headstone of your grave.

540
01:04:42,544 --> 01:04:49,797
After this demonstration,
do you accept my proposal?

541
01:06:06,255 --> 01:06:10,460
Franco, what are you doing?
You're reaking the promise.

542
01:06:10,461 --> 01:06:14,199
Kiss it.
That's it.

543
01:06:14,234 --> 01:06:19,051
Kiss it.
Remember the "Hand of Travertine."

544
01:06:19,052 --> 01:06:24,224
That's better.
Be patient.

545
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:29,290
Show your power.
Show who you are.

546
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:10,748
Open the windows.

547
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:12,530
Unlock the doors.

548
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:19,807
Besides the "Hand of Travertine",
he also has a loose ass.

549
01:07:52,808 --> 01:07:54,250
Damn you, again!

550
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:57,049
- I don't know him.
- Who doesn'tt know this bastard?

551
01:07:57,050 --> 01:08:00,081
It lands on my little car, everyday.

552
01:08:00,082 --> 01:08:05,972
I'm pissed off . I'll send
this moron, to the madhouse.

553
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:10,673
- I was dressing myself...
-Open the door. Let me see the damage.

554
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:14,323
Look, the pervert!
What are you doing?

555
01:08:14,324 --> 01:08:18,468
What are you doing? Landing
is not enough? Also, want my wife?

556
01:08:20,469 --> 01:08:25,116
Get out of my car,
I'll kick your ass.

557
01:08:25,117 --> 01:08:28,730
It's not only the car,
now, is also my wife.

558
01:08:30,431 --> 01:08:32,831
- Don't be jealous...
- Get out of my sight!

559
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:37,381
My clothes. My clothes.
Don't throw them to the ground.

560
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:51,988
The situation is serious.
We must do something.

561
01:08:51,989 --> 01:08:56,986
Master, you don't trust me?
You don't think I can win?

562
01:08:56,987 --> 01:08:59,397
That's right.

563
01:09:00,398 --> 01:09:02,757
Master, we have always
the option of the killers.

564
01:09:02,958 --> 01:09:07,862
- They just need your command.
- No. I have a better idea.

565
01:09:07,863 --> 01:09:08,838
Which?

566
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,362
- Mr. Strozzi, please.
- Speaking.

567
01:09:21,363 --> 01:09:24,663
I wanted to ask you a favor.

568
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:12,114
Just a minute, please.

569
01:10:23,659 --> 01:10:25,339
- May I come in?
- Please.

570
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:28,246
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

571
01:10:28,247 --> 01:10:32,523
What a beautiful home.
Worthy of you.

572
01:10:32,524 --> 01:10:38,347
- I'm glad you're doing well.
- I owe you a lot.

573
01:10:38,348 --> 01:10:43,455
- Do not thank me, but you remember me?
- Of course, I do.

574
01:10:43,456 --> 01:10:49,531
- Remember we have a score to settle.
- Yes, I remember.

575
01:10:49,532 --> 01:10:54,123
- Remember this?
- This, not so much.

576
01:10:56,024 --> 01:10:58,636
- That I owed you this.
- These are some little arrears.

577
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:03,809
- Some little arrears that you owe me.
- Forgive me.

578
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:09,046
- Which you're going to pay, right?
- I can't because I have no money...

579
01:11:09,247 --> 01:11:14,901
But if you could take a little off,
you know,...no?

580
01:11:15,802 --> 01:11:17,695
I'm going to work for the City Hall.

581
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:19,213
- Forgive me.
- Please.

582
01:11:19,214 --> 01:11:25,072
- With which hand did you sign this bill?
- With this one.

583
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:28,119
- Allow me?
- Be my guest. - Thank you.

584
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:37,847
I am wretched, you know?

585
01:11:38,848 --> 01:11:44,159
That cannibal would eat my whole hand.
How will I do the tournament now?

586
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:49,337
Take it easy. Kung Fu is not everything
in life. You're overreacting.

587
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:53,533
Don't you see, one hand washes the other
and without them I don't know what to do.

588
01:11:53,534 --> 01:11:58,274
Now with one hand, what do I do?
The other says, stop, stop!

589
01:11:58,275 --> 01:12:01,005
Okay,
I'm going to make a special treatment.

590
01:12:01,006 --> 01:12:03,769
At this point everyone
will be looking for me.

591
01:12:04,406 --> 01:12:10,921
Especially... my master,
if I don't show up, he'll be worried.

592
01:12:10,922 --> 01:12:13,310
Pity, after all that effort.

593
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,164
After all that tiredness.

594
01:12:15,165 --> 01:12:19,491
To him, my misfortune,
will be a big disappointment.

595
01:12:25,492 --> 01:12:28,512
- Murderer, what are you doing?
- Nothing.

596
01:12:28,513 --> 01:12:30,522
This is acupuncture.

597
01:12:30,523 --> 01:12:33,426
To relieve pain
and the fever.

598
01:12:37,427 --> 01:12:40,281
Ormai, the vacancy
for the traffic warden is yours.

599
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:43,358
Basically,
you have no opponents.

600
01:12:43,393 --> 01:12:46,304
- Guaranteed you'll win.
- How do you know?

601
01:12:47,305 --> 01:12:51,583
It is true that I have no opponents.
I am Attila.

602
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:54,273
And wherever I go,
everyone fears me.

603
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:02,108
- Lately, have you been to my house?
- Yes, I have.

604
01:13:02,109 --> 01:13:07,030
- Without my order. - I stop there to...
- Do not do it anymore.

605
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:12,486
What do I pay the gardener for?

606
01:13:14,135 --> 01:13:15,300
Excuse me, master?

607
01:13:16,335 --> 01:13:18,758
Mr. Strozzi wants to talk to you.

608
01:13:18,759 --> 01:13:22,231
Come in Mr. Strozzi.

609
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:25,702
- What is the pleasure of your visit?
- Thank you.

610
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:32,399
- I am honored with your visit.
- The honor is mine.

611
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,405
Mr. Strozzi was the one who got rid of
the "Hand of Travertine."

612
01:13:41,406 --> 01:13:44,953
No gentlemen,
I used an Italian method...

613
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:48,333
that can destroy a man
or a nation.

614
01:13:48,334 --> 01:13:49,820
The protest!

615
01:13:50,521 --> 01:13:53,421
- A que devo a honra da sua visita?
- Ai, sim.

616
01:13:53,722 --> 01:14:00,065
Glad to see you, but there is the issue
of the debt in protest.

617
01:14:00,066 --> 01:14:05,289
Who will pay it now, since Franco
has been out of circulation?

618
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:11,392
Do not worry.
Everything will be paid...

619
01:14:11,393 --> 01:14:14,705
and with interest.
Take him!

620
01:14:29,794 --> 01:14:33,748
No.
See what that cannibal did.

621
01:14:35,249 --> 01:14:37,049
Beautiful.
It is always a hand.

622
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:40,073
Yes, but I can't fight anymore.

623
01:14:40,074 --> 01:14:43,994
I feel the hand all sore.

624
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:47,977
That old scrouge ruined me.

625
01:14:47,878 --> 01:14:48,915
See.

626
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:55,128
If you really want to fight,
why don't you marry me?

627
01:14:55,129 --> 01:14:58,162
But that is another kind of combat,
you know?

628
01:14:58,163 --> 01:15:00,777
I prepared to win.

629
01:15:01,778 --> 01:15:05,729
- You're going to win.
- Of course I will.

630
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:10,936
- I'll help you.
- You, how?

631
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,488
Master, where is your champion?

632
01:15:32,489 --> 01:15:35,583
- When will he get in the ring?
- He is coming.

633
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:41,445
Master, I can't wait anymore. I am
obliged to give the victory to Attila.

634
01:15:42,446 --> 01:15:43,823
Be patient.

635
01:15:44,724 --> 01:15:46,269
- Then, I will continue.
- Yes, yes.

636
01:15:52,270 --> 01:15:54,546
Boys take this guy away,
we will continue.

637
01:15:54,547 --> 01:15:55,802
Attention please!

638
01:15:59,503 --> 01:16:00,876
Attila the Scourge.

639
01:16:01,877 --> 01:16:05,260
The terror of the city
and countryside.

640
01:16:05,261 --> 01:16:09,204
will now face,
the opponent Renato,

641
01:16:09,205 --> 01:16:13,843
Chinese by birth
and Italian by adoption.

642
01:16:17,944 --> 01:16:22,111
There he is.
Applause. Applause.

643
01:16:25,112 --> 01:16:29,975
Here is your opportunity
to compete in the tournament.

644
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:42,483
We won the tournament!

645
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:55,141
Master, when will he arrive?

646
01:16:55,142 --> 01:16:58,437
If there are no more opponents,
I'll give the victory to Attila.

647
01:17:00,438 --> 01:17:03,020
Why do I have to go
through this situation?

648
01:17:10,021 --> 01:17:11,670
Finally, he arrived.

649
01:17:11,671 --> 01:17:14,053
Now they are going to see
what he will do.

650
01:17:21,054 --> 01:17:23,708
Go after him, go after him.

651
01:17:31,709 --> 01:17:32,709
Go after him.

652
01:17:42,710 --> 01:17:47,217
You stay there.
And you there. Do we agree?

653
01:17:49,218 --> 01:17:52,323
The rules are to be followed.
No, to dirty tricks.

654
01:18:46,324 --> 01:18:47,728
Get back to him.

655
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:59,298
Franco, what do you do.
Use your head like Daddy.

656
01:19:12,899 --> 01:19:15,011
Coward. You're worth nothing.
Go.

657
01:19:22,012 --> 01:19:26,296
Go Franco, hit him hard.
With the head like Daddy.

658
01:19:31,297 --> 01:19:32,450
Go Franco.

659
01:20:16,451 --> 01:20:17,888
Bravo!

660
01:20:54,889 --> 01:20:57,063
Thank you Mr. kekkor.

661
01:20:57,064 --> 01:21:00,836
With this wig,
you gave me the possibility...

662
01:21:00,837 --> 01:21:02,837
to defeat the terrible Attila.

663
01:21:04,838 --> 01:21:07,178
You should have seen it.
How exciting.

664
01:21:07,179 --> 01:21:11,907
- Especially over Attila.
- That's why it is my treasure...

665
01:21:11,908 --> 01:21:15,698
my secret weapon.
When I don't have it I feel naked.

666
01:21:15,699 --> 01:21:19,390
Truth is, without it I would not be able
to defend my interests.

667
01:21:19,388 --> 01:21:20,388
Mr. Kekkor.

668
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:23,535
- I'll show you my secret.
- Okay.

669
01:21:30,036 --> 01:21:31,358
This...

670
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:34,059
is what made the difference.

671
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:38,982
Well thought, well thought.

672
01:21:40,083 --> 01:21:41,403
Let's toast to the victory.

673
01:21:49,404 --> 01:21:52,094
This is my wig.
Give it to me.

674
01:21:57,295 --> 01:22:02,095
Papa, cann't you walk.
Let me help you.

675
01:22:02,096 --> 01:22:05,270
Without the wig,
I'm nobody.

676
01:22:07,271 --> 01:22:12,210
At least give me moral support.
Beat them.

677
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,699
- Daddy.
- Calm down.

678
01:22:57,700 --> 01:23:00,008
- Daddy.
- Wait, wait.

679
01:23:23,809 --> 01:23:25,079
Some bread.

680
01:24:24,009 --> 01:24:26,852
The eels do not want to sleep...

681
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:28,355
the crabs...

682
01:24:28,656 --> 01:24:35,218
There they are...
ready to get fun.

683
01:24:36,519 --> 01:24:39,017
And now some flour...

684
01:24:39,018 --> 01:24:41,018
for a good baking.

685
01:24:43,019 --> 01:24:45,546
Flour from the best quality.

686
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:49,415
How beautiful you are in white.

687
01:24:49,416 --> 01:24:51,427
You look like three ghosts.

688
01:24:54,428 --> 01:24:57,319
Genlemen...
may I have your attention.

689
01:24:57,554 --> 01:25:00,097
Now we're going do get
a real headbutt.

690
01:25:01,627 --> 01:25:03,369
Yes....seriously.
Let's do the following.

691
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:07,739
I'll count  one, two, three,
and then you give a headbutt.

692
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,507
Okay?
I'll be in the middle.

693
01:25:13,008 --> 01:25:14,101
One.

694
01:25:15,502 --> 01:25:16,882
Two.

695
01:25:16,883 --> 01:25:18,229
Three.

696
01:25:29,230 --> 01:25:31,479
Come, come celebrate the victory.

697
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:40,723
- Mr. Kekkor.
- What is it?

698
01:25:42,724 --> 01:25:45,860
I want to ask your daughter's hand.

699
01:25:49,019 --> 01:25:51,954
As you wish,
you're too famous to be refused.

700
01:25:52,955 --> 01:25:55,496
- Do you allow?
- Yes.

701
01:25:56,497 --> 01:25:57,706
Daddy.

702
01:25:59,707 --> 01:26:00,816
Francoso.

703
01:26:01,717 --> 01:26:05,595
Franco. Francoso, come here.
Give me a hug.

704
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:08,866
- Ohhh, the briefcase.
- Dom Vito.

705
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:11,960
- Who is this?
- Franco.

706
01:26:11,961 --> 01:26:16,420
- I'm aware of your victory. Bravo!
Bang, bang!

707
01:26:16,421 --> 01:26:20,501
- You deserve a prize. A surprise.
- A surprise?

708
01:26:21,502 --> 01:26:23,502
Come in my darling.

709
01:26:23,503 --> 01:26:26,572
Look, what a beauty, look.

710
01:26:27,573 --> 01:26:32,934
Francoso, this is the Imaculate flower
I promised you.

711
01:26:32,935 --> 01:26:34,316
My daughter.

712
01:26:34,317 --> 01:26:38,386
Francoso, you deserve her.
It's your wife.

713
01:26:38,387 --> 01:26:40,406
- Your wife?
- Who is this?

714
01:26:40,407 --> 01:26:42,858
- Your husband.
- Husband, what husband?

715
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:46,842
- I like this one. Go away.

716
01:26:46,843 --> 01:26:48,619
Come here, my treasure.

717
01:26:54,020 --> 01:26:57,620
- I like skinnies, but we'll manage it.
- Oh, my scatterbrained.

718
01:27:02,828 --> 01:27:05,121
Franco...
the time has come.

719
01:27:05,122 --> 01:27:07,268
- Here is the owner of Rome.
- What owner?

720
01:27:07,269 --> 01:27:09,448
No, the Presidente of Rome.

721
01:27:09,449 --> 01:27:12,172
- The Mayor of Rome.
- What a nonsense. What do you say?

722
01:27:12,173 --> 01:27:15,473
We got it.
My son.

723
01:27:17,021 --> 01:27:18,474
- Kiss the gentleman.
- Why?

724
01:27:18,475 --> 01:27:21,169
This gentleman is here
to confirm that you...

725
01:27:21,011 --> 01:27:24,244
are the winner
for the traffic warden's vacancy.

726
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:28,336
- Kiss him, kiss him.
- May I? - He's a bit shy.

727
01:27:33,336 --> 01:27:34,897
- You kissed the Mayor of Rome.
- I'm happy.

728
01:27:34,898 --> 01:27:37,924
- From now on, I'm your father.
- Why?

729
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:43,963
By a chinese tradition,
a man who is a mentor of anoter man...

730
01:27:43,964 --> 01:27:46,835
who does everything for him
to become a man... - That's true.

731
01:27:46,836 --> 01:27:49,772
Therefore, becomes is father.

732
01:27:49,773 --> 01:27:53,864
Thus, from now on you'll work for you
and take care of me, as well.

733
01:27:55,965 --> 01:28:02,129
- I agree, but I'm going to marry her.
- What? Alright.

734
01:28:03,345 --> 01:28:08,667
- Yes, but you'll take care of me because
I'm your father. - The father is I!

735
01:28:08,668 --> 01:28:12,187
- What? I am the father.
- No, I am. - No, no, I am.

736
01:28:12,188 --> 01:28:15,096
- I am the father.  - The father is I.
- Excuse me, I am, not any of you.

737
01:28:18,770 --> 01:28:21,097
- A stick for you, another for me
and we'll see who... - No, no.

738
01:28:59,098 --> 01:29:00,803
What you're doing
is against the law.

739
01:29:00,804 --> 01:29:02,649
And you too.

740
01:29:02,781 --> 01:29:04,980
- We're stoppped here and the officer
do nothing.  - Isn't that enough?

741
01:29:06,981 --> 01:29:08,981
No, no.

742
01:29:10,982 --> 01:29:15,538
Don't recognise me, right?
Disturbing the public order?

743
01:29:16,893 --> 01:29:19,675
A thief of high caliber.
Once wanted to kill me.

744
01:29:21,676 --> 01:29:24,062
- Don't like it, right?
- No, no! I beg you!

745
01:29:29,411 --> 01:29:31,063
I'll give you
the strike of mercy.

746
01:30:39,211 --> 01:30:46,064
The END
