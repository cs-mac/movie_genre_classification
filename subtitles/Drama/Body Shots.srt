1
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,440
Do you have pain-killers in the house?
- I don't think so.

2
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,302
Codeine?

3
00:03:43,965 --> 00:03:45,605
Sorry.

4
00:03:47,218 --> 00:03:51,538
What the hell happened?
- I have no idea.

5
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:57,917
Is this your place or mine?

6
00:04:03,153 --> 00:04:04,913
Mine.

7
00:04:06,823 --> 00:04:11,223
So that would make you...
- Jane.

8
00:04:13,706 --> 00:04:16,706
So, then I am... of course...

9
00:04:17,001 --> 00:04:19,961
Rick.
- Rick and Jane, right.

10
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,610
I remember it.

11
00:04:25,427 --> 00:04:27,507
From last night, right?

12
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:31,885
Last night...

13
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:33,893
Yeah...

14
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:37,067
What happened?

15
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,199
What happened?

16
00:04:42,112 --> 00:04:44,272
That's what I just said, what happened?

17
00:04:46,575 --> 00:04:48,455
Oh my God, my head...

18
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:48,795
Let me ask you a question.
- Ok.

19
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:52,452
We didn't...

20
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:57,764
Last night, I mean... we... didn't we...?

21
00:05:58,196 --> 00:05:59,196
No.

22
00:05:59,947 --> 00:06:01,587
Good.

23
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:06,805
Why good?
- Because I like to think that I will remember.

24
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:27,063
Who the hell is that?
-What time is it?

25
00:06:28,354 --> 00:06:30,594
It's 4:37, Jesus Christ...

26
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,540
Don't move.

27
00:06:46,582 --> 00:06:51,422
Sara? Is that you?
Honey, what's goimg on?

28
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:56,436
What happened to your face?
- Got wet.

29
00:06:56,718 --> 00:06:58,758
Honey, how did you get here?
- Jane?

30
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:02,942
I screwed up.
- How did you screw up, honey?

31
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:04,941
He attacked me.
- Who attacked you?

32
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,821
The football player.

33
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:08,329
Penorisi?

34
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:10,725
Wait, what do you mean attacked?
- Let me here.

35
00:07:10,983 --> 00:07:15,703
Is she alright? What Jesus, what
happened? What did he do, Sara? Tell me.

36
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,512
Just tell me.

37
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:23,426
What the hell are you doing?
- Bitch! Did you become crazy?

38
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,565
He fucking raped me.

39
00:07:29,129 --> 00:07:30,129
What?!

40
00:07:30,714 --> 00:07:34,074
You are fucking wasted here, I hate you!

41
00:07:34,384 --> 00:07:36,904
Honey, you are scaring me.
Just try to calm down, ok?

42
00:07:37,179 --> 00:07:40,459
This girl is psychotic.
- Rick, stop it!

43
00:07:41,851 --> 00:07:44,971
Relax!
- He threw me on the ground.

44
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:50,711
What do you say? Did he forced you to fuck him?
- Rick, stop it! Just let her go. Stay out of here!

45
00:07:50,945 --> 00:07:51,945
- What did she say?

46
00:07:52,195 --> 00:07:56,515
Just leave us alone! You are making
her worse. Just get out of here.

47
00:07:58,911 --> 00:07:59,911
Alright.

48
00:08:04,418 --> 00:08:06,138
Take the jacket.

49
00:08:09,089 --> 00:08:11,969
Alright, I'm going. But look at her face,
you need to get her to hospital.

50
00:08:12,093 --> 00:08:13,093
Go, get out of here!

51
00:08:17,973 --> 00:08:21,053
What happened?
- I don't know, Jane.

52
00:08:32,907 --> 00:08:36,827
Ok, so let's go to my place
and we can see the boys later.

53
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,161
Yes, we're gonna have a great time tonight.

54
00:08:39,414 --> 00:08:44,214
Come here at my desk, Gary!
- Have a nice weekend, counsellor.

55
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:48,707
If I'm a little bit late,
just let yourselves in, ok?

56
00:08:50,468 --> 00:08:51,428
Ok. Bye.

57
00:08:56,141 --> 00:09:00,701
And later, we'll go to the pool room.
I'm working there tonight.

58
00:09:01,063 --> 00:09:02,903
No. Jane's with me at her house.

59
00:09:04,776 --> 00:09:08,776
Yeah. Eight, nine...
Ok, then we'll just go from there.

60
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:15,153
People don't date anymore.
You know, I mean a sort of... go out with friends.

61
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:18,778
You meet in a restaurant
or a club.

62
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:23,803
Whatever, and then... everybody just... a sort of...
checks everybody else out and then things happen.

63
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:28,060
You know... people sort of... connect.

64
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,069
Or they don't.

65
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:37,634
So... you go out with your friends, right?
You hang out...

66
00:09:41,148 --> 00:09:43,988
You're trying not to have that look on your face.

67
00:09:44,277 --> 00:09:50,357
When you haven't been laid for six months,
you get a very desperate look.

68
00:09:50,784 --> 00:09:54,504
Men see it and run.

69
00:09:56,124 --> 00:09:59,684
I have seen women at a bar with
that look on them.

70
00:10:00,003 --> 00:10:03,923
And you think:
she's waiting.

71
00:10:04,925 --> 00:10:09,365
She's either, fucked up
or she is an actress.

72
00:10:18,564 --> 00:10:21,084
Dating spells relationship.

73
00:10:21,359 --> 00:10:26,319
But, if you're just hanging out with someone
and you know... you kind a fall to bed with him

74
00:10:26,699 --> 00:10:31,339
But it's not like you're really involved. It's safer,
you know. It's just sex.

75
00:10:33,873 --> 00:10:37,513
Ok, I got you. Nine o'clock.

76
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:42,996
Hey sweatheart, you know me. If there's pussy on
the menu, I am there. Out.

77
00:10:43,383 --> 00:10:49,423
For me, it's not the question to date or not to date.
For me, it's a question of to hose or not to hose.

78
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,288
And I hate missing the opportunity.

79
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:57,681
I think important is a certain number of hosings
and each time you pass it up, it's gone forever.

80
00:10:57,941 --> 00:11:04,901
It's like in porn, with a certain number of hard ons.
Maybe it's measured in courts... or in my case gallons... whatever.

81
00:11:05,366 --> 00:11:09,126
As long as there's pussy on the menu?
- That's what he said.

82
00:11:10,246 --> 00:11:12,446
Are you ready to go?
- Five minutes.

83
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:18,748
Hey, Rick, we're going to have Trent with me tonight.
- Yeah, well... maybe no one will notice him.

84
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:32,350
Hello. Mr. Thorpe, how are you doing?
What situation?

85
00:11:33,605 --> 00:11:39,005
Right, Malaysia, yeah. I'm all over there,
I've been watching that, we come in right now.

86
00:11:39,403 --> 00:11:43,043
You know... I work hard, I play hard.

87
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:48,326
When I go out with a bunch of guys,
I know where I want to end up. And it's not a bunch of guys.

88
00:11:48,705 --> 00:11:50,825
I don't want to end up engaged and married, either.

89
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,120
I like to come.
That's my favorite part.

90
00:11:56,463 --> 00:11:58,023
Shoot me.

91
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:04,560
I believe in courtship. I like dating... I mean,
I coudn't just jump in the bed with somebody.

92
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:11,971
Even if all you're after is just the sex.
I need that time. I need that... process... ritual.

93
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,600
It's not about getting close to someone, because you're not.

94
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:22,501
It's easy to think you're getting close to someone...cause
you're having sex with him. But see, that's the illusion.

95
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:27,031
Cause if you really get close to
everyone that you fucked...

96
00:12:27,373 --> 00:12:29,813
...you wouldn't be this lonely, would you?

97
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:35,544
Lonely as this lonely does!
- Here is Friday evening.

98
00:12:35,924 --> 00:12:40,964
KRCK k - Wreck radio, babe. Ok, we're talking shit,
what are you doing this weekend?

99
00:12:41,346 --> 00:12:45,346
It's sunny and clear today, 70 degrees,
sunny and clear tomorrow, 70 degrees.

100
00:12:45,684 --> 00:12:48,964
Sunny and clear Sunday, 70 degrees.

101
00:12:50,106 --> 00:12:56,346
Absolutely man, look. If a woman gets you exited. And you
get an errection. If she doesn't have sex with you.

102
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,460
Your penis is going to fall off.
- That's true. That's a fact, it will fall off.

103
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:03,261
It has happened to a couple of friends of mine.
- I've had my blue balls so I know what you guys are talking about.

104
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,852
No, blue ball's nothing. We are talking about the penis

105
00:13:06,082 --> 00:13:09,802
We are talking about the constant graining and the grouch
when the jeans' on, for now...

106
00:13:10,127 --> 00:13:16,247
then the dirty girl dares look you in the eye and tell you she's not
gonna go down. - Oh, I hate life had to kill that one...

107
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:19,157
Break!
Can we please get back to your story?

108
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,870
Anyway, we're outside. And two of the friends come up.

109
00:13:22,141 --> 00:13:25,381
So, just tell me exactly,
how drunk were you at this point?

110
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:32,526
Drunk? Rick, no no, see, Rick's not drunk at all.
Rick is a fucking shit can at this point.

111
00:13:32,986 --> 00:13:38,506
With pure funk in me. Done. The only thing I'm thinking right now
is heil Mary up to God, I'm thinking, please...

112
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,870
...God, just, I want my dick dock before I pass out.

113
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:48,144
No, I mean, I like blow jobs, I do.

114
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:52,380
I mean, when you think about how all your senses are just
concentrated in your face and...

115
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,070
...put a front row seeded on a guy... I mean... what's not to like?

116
00:13:56,888 --> 00:13:59,448
Some women don't want to.
Some women just won't.

117
00:13:59,724 --> 00:14:04,204
Well personally, I mean, I like that power of it
that I am being in control.

118
00:14:04,854 --> 00:14:05,854
Yap.

119
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,387
Yeah, you teeth are right there...

120
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:14,813
The problem is, once you get down there,
it's kind a awkward to stop, you know.

121
00:14:15,158 --> 00:14:19,558
You have locked jaw,
your saliva is like coming out everywhere...

122
00:14:19,912 --> 00:14:25,032
...you know, your eyes are watering... I mean, I've always
been thinking, am I doing this right?

123
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:30,122
Well, you learn.
Practice makes perfect.

124
00:14:31,926 --> 00:14:36,206
I mean, the blow jobs I give today are a lot
different than the once I gave five years ago..

125
00:14:36,556 --> 00:14:41,156
You know, there is this class now in L.A.,
it's a blow job class.

126
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,320
No way!
- It's true.

127
00:14:43,564 --> 00:14:48,324
I have a friend, her boyfriend gave her
courses of that.

128
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,734
It just simply not all going to fit.

129
00:14:50,989 --> 00:14:56,429
Now the other thing is that from a technique standpoint,
your hands and your mouth...

130
00:14:56,828 --> 00:14:59,388
... are so much more versatile than your vagina.

131
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:05,624
Gotta be hands on. You gotta be using your hands.
There's a technique. Most women are just not aware of this.

132
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:11,327
Now what you are doing with this technique is
mimicing those sensations.

133
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,080
I think if you really analyze it, it's
a combination of technique and context.

134
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:18,990
It's what's being done, and actually where it's being done.

135
00:15:19,311 --> 00:15:24,151
In a car. In a bathroom,
at a party.

136
00:15:24,526 --> 00:15:26,246
Outdoors is good.

137
00:15:26,486 --> 00:15:32,126
You know, you got people nearby.
The danger of being caught is very good.

138
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:36,105
I like that.

139
00:15:36,247 --> 00:15:41,207
It's a combination of three things: one is the heat,
the second is the moisture and the third is the pressure.

140
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:46,020
Tongue, of course. Oh, and lips, oh yeah,
big, collagen, sucking lips.

141
00:15:46,383 --> 00:15:50,263
Make the appointment,
pay the plastic surgeon. Just get it done.

142
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:54,116
Lips, tongue, hands.
No teeth.

143
00:15:55,268 --> 00:15:57,628
What are you talking about? Teeth are the best.

144
00:15:57,895 --> 00:16:01,495
First that had my nob showing...
she had braces.

145
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:08,176
Alright? My dick looked like a fucking chew toy,
but, you know, it was a... you know that sweet kind of pain.

146
00:16:08,616 --> 00:16:15,256
The whole apparatus should come with a blue print.
Pictures and instructions... I mean... in English and Espanol.

147
00:16:16,874 --> 00:16:18,794
And just some things that you gotta learn.

148
00:16:19,043 --> 00:16:24,363
So really what you are doing, when you do these manual and
oral techniques, is you are mimicing those sensations.

149
00:16:24,758 --> 00:16:27,838
And in essence, creating an imposter vagina.

150
00:16:28,137 --> 00:16:34,657
Now, going forward with that, you've chosen your lubricans,
great. You have your dildo dejoured, great.

151
00:16:35,102 --> 00:16:40,582
Now ladies, if you can put that all together. Ok?
So, like this... and come down.

152
00:16:42,444 --> 00:16:44,644
You can actually... is that comfortable?

153
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:21,491
They were squealing there, "what's going on".
I'm like, hey, come on in, wanna have a look.

154
00:17:21,821 --> 00:17:25,021
Hello, barkeep, let me get four J&Ds for me
and my boys here!

155
00:17:25,159 --> 00:17:26,159
Hey, Penorisi!

156
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,007
Can I get a vodka soda, please, my love?

157
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:38,946
And Tenny, when you get the chance, can we get a Marlot,
a vodka wodka-tonic and a club soda for me.

158
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,820
Drink!

159
00:17:40,885 --> 00:17:41,885
Yes, salut!

160
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:46,222
Cheers!

161
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,870
A need another Jim Beam here.
- You know... I'm sorry... I do not actually work here.

162
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:55,218
Well, make it for mine, for Christ sake.

163
00:17:56,192 --> 00:17:58,232
Fucking aloman.

164
00:17:58,986 --> 00:17:59,986
What?
- What?

165
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:08,164
This venom!

166
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:20,125
Haven't any food in my stomach.

167
00:18:20,385 --> 00:18:23,625
I am Mikey, by the way.
Ricky being a raw peace of shit that he is.

168
00:18:23,931 --> 00:18:27,011
Shit, I'm sorry. Mike, Shawn Denigan, works in my office.
Shawn, this is Mike Penorisi.

169
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:33,949
Alright, that's it. I just wanna get so fucked up.
I wanna sing and scream and dance all night long...

170
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:37,561
and pee in the bushes on the way home.

171
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:40,343
Do you know what do you need? - What?
- You need a new man.

172
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:45,896
See, that's exactly what I don't need.
Because you can't do shit with the man. Nothing.

173
00:18:46,288 --> 00:18:50,128
I can remember you from Arizona State. This guy was
number one that came down from Georgia

174
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,700
This kid is everywhere. Tackles, picks...
- Football sucks.

175
00:18:55,048 --> 00:18:57,528
Who is he play for?
- Raiders.

176
00:18:57,801 --> 00:19:04,921
And he just signed a five million dollar
contract. And he is gorgeous.

177
00:19:05,392 --> 00:19:11,792
Well, his wallet sounds... gorgeous.
- Yes, he sounds like just your type, Sara.

178
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:15,754
Shawn desperately wants to be a Raiders fan,
but he's canned.

179
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,564
Why's that?
- He hasn't kill anyone yet.

180
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:22,782
You peace of shit, come here!

181
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,738
Hey, guys, no, no... come on now!

182
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:31,671
Yeah well, that's the joke, right?

183
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,637
Two guys, that they are so in each other, that they wish
one of them had a vagina.

184
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:41,205
And when they both go to Sweden, they both
get it done to surprise the other one.

185
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:43,159
That's the joke.

186
00:19:43,393 --> 00:19:48,313
Ricky ever tell you he was always the last one picked
for kick ball during recess.

187
00:19:48,691 --> 00:19:52,611
The exchange students were making
fun of him.

188
00:19:55,865 --> 00:20:00,185
Sorry about that, folks.
Just get this lovely couple around.

189
00:20:00,537 --> 00:20:03,097
Yei, my favorite!

190
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:09,098
How many football players are coming tonight?
- Oh, the whole team's been working to do all of them.

191
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,624
Oh, yeah!
- How many is that?

192
00:20:13,927 --> 00:20:17,367
So how many are gonna be there?
- Three, maybe four.

193
00:20:17,681 --> 00:20:19,601
Good looking in this shit?
- What do you think?

194
00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:22,809
How about that Shawn?
- Uhm, I don't think so.

195
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,383
He... he's the one that actually is Rick with.
They work together.

196
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:31,771
What's the name of this lawyer? This one you're after.
- Jane. Her name's Jane.

197
00:20:32,155 --> 00:20:38,155
She's a... pretty special as a girl.
You'll see... you'll see when you meet her.

198
00:20:39,329 --> 00:20:43,409
She clerks at the DEA's office, actually Shawn introduced us.
He's dating a friend of her, Sara.

199
00:20:43,751 --> 00:20:45,831
Two lawyers in bed together.

200
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:52,127
Anyway Shawn is like the perfect gentleman.
He takes me to the most amazing places

201
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:56,512
What do you think? Pretty nice, a?

202
00:20:57,682 --> 00:21:00,162
This is so beautiful.

203
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:05,995
He orders for both of us, he opens doors...
- You just like him because he orders appetizers.

204
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:10,841
Hey, I always said I would never marry a guy
unless he orders appetizers.

205
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:14,833
It is a true reflection of his lifestyle.

206
00:21:14,118 --> 00:21:19,398
We should start with some appetizers, a?
- I love appetizers.

207
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:25,271
We are like twins together already, ok?
And the guy not even tried to kiss me.

208
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:29,872
Honey, he hasn't kissed you yet
because he respects you.

209
00:21:30,218 --> 00:21:31,658
Can you understand my concept?

210
00:21:32,554 --> 00:21:33,554
No!

211
00:21:35,057 --> 00:21:41,537
I can't, you know, this whole 'nice guy' thing is just...
it's too much for me, you know... it's just... too personal.

212
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:48,252
Ain't a thing that you should worry about it.
I mean let's just go out tonight and have fun.

213
00:21:49,114 --> 00:21:54,074
I like Shawn, I do, but... I don't know, I mean...
He doesn't even drink.

214
00:22:06,008 --> 00:22:11,128
You know what? I mean... I haven't been to a club
since me and Keith broke up.

215
00:22:11,514 --> 00:22:15,474
But that was three months ago.
Keith is nothing but a teenie memory now.

216
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,730
Very teenie.

217
00:22:21,441 --> 00:22:25,961
You got to go?
- Yeah. Grab a bite to eat?

218
00:22:27,573 --> 00:22:31,613
Alright, there's three guys, right?
Rick, Shawn and Mike.

219
00:22:32,745 --> 00:22:35,345
Is there more?
- There is and there isn't.

220
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:38,864
Is he hot?
- Oh no, it's Trent.

221
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:42,010
No, no, please tell me it's not Trent.

222
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:44,218
What's up, nigger?

223
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:49,526
Holy fucking West Hollywood!
- Jesus Christ Trent what the hell you're thinking?

224
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:53,247
Dude, I ain't fucking eighteen, what do you
want me to do, go home and change?

225
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,800
Why would you even wear this for golf?
- Ah, excuse me, silence, alright?

226
00:22:57,105 --> 00:23:00,625
Want another burrito, fat boy? - Fuck off steriod!
- Better be far than near me.

227
00:23:00,777 --> 00:23:05,536
Hey, how is it going, pal?

228
00:23:03,196 --> 00:23:05,636
I just made ten grand of this mexican conglomerate.

229
00:23:05,907 --> 00:23:10,907
Fucking merger, I called it, dude. Stock has five percent
gabbled up and it's time to celebrate.

230
00:23:11,288 --> 00:23:16,848
A little golf to bring with a country club, little blues, little pussy.
- Ehm, Mikey, boost boy.

231
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:23,157
Can I? - Go ahead.
- Thank you.

232
00:23:24,719 --> 00:23:29,079
That's Trent, I like it.
- It's gonna get you GL wild.

233
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:32,433
Who I'm gonna fucking tonight? Whitney?
- Want to snap?

234
00:23:32,728 --> 00:23:36,408
No she's all over my fucking shit last week.
She's grabbin' my hag and everything.

235
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:42,253
Oh yeah, Trent you gotta nice way with women there.
- It is a combo thing, sexy clothes, charming personality.

236
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:47,776
Fuck, you know what, I'm gonna see that pussy tonight and
I'm gonna fuck and swing my dick and you guys can eat baked hackoes.

237
00:23:48,161 --> 00:23:51,721
I'll take a piss.
- I hope we don't beat the shit out of that guy.

238
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:06,589
What is so wrong with Trent?
- Oh my God! He's a fricandeau, Jane.

239
00:24:06,973 --> 00:24:11,333
He was so drunk at this place when Eddie
was gazing at this woman...

240
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:14,527
...and smiled at us... like you must have been jealous or something.

241
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,655
Is that the guy we saw that night?
- Yeah, when we ended up at Cue's.

242
00:24:17,944 --> 00:24:21,104
Oh, you had to see the girl... she was... uh...

243
00:24:21,407 --> 00:24:26,047
That was so no girl, whatever it was.
I bet it was 60.

244
00:24:26,412 --> 00:24:31,052
She had a vigorous bunch red fuzzy hair and the biggest...
like... her boobs, no joke, are like this big.

245
00:24:31,418 --> 00:24:35,378
And his face was stuck in her cops.
- It was horrible!

246
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Ok, you take your 20 year old, right?
- Yeah, great body... no contest.

247
00:24:42,638 --> 00:24:45,518
You want skills, you gotta go at least 30, 35.

248
00:24:45,808 --> 00:24:49,048
Now you gonna have to give a little bit of tongue for that, ok... because...

249
00:24:49,188 --> 00:24:52,787
...you know... 30, 35, I don't care,
you go to jam her twice a day, three times a day doesn't matter.

250
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:57,787
Twenty year old body is going by by, alright?
But if you get over that visual thing and I tell you something, alright...

251
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:03,477
You have never had, what you have with a 40 year old woman...
if it's the right 40 year old woman.

252
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:09,750
And if you are ever fortunate enough to run into the right
50 year old woman...

253
00:25:10,168 --> 00:25:15,488
...oh my God, you have no idea.
You got no fucking idea.

254
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:18,749
He was sucking her boobs in a bar?
- Yeah!

255
00:25:18,928 --> 00:25:23,368
Then he passed out on them.
And then the bouncer kicked them both out.

256
00:25:23,725 --> 00:25:28,325
Speaking of boobs... my here lay calm.
- Don't worry, they are still new.

257
00:25:28,688 --> 00:25:33,888
I know, but they haven't loosened up at all. They are like
chunks of granit sticking out of my chest.

258
00:25:34,278 --> 00:25:37,918
I still can't believe you make 3:40 at night working at this place.
- Then might she works hard.

259
00:25:38,241 --> 00:25:41,521
No, I work hard.
She helds up the fucking teller.

260
00:25:41,161 --> 00:25:43,961
Agip! How are you sweetie?
- Hey, how are you doing?

261
00:25:44,082 --> 00:25:47,681
Looking good, looking good!
I didn't know you're working tonight. - Yap!

262
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,655
How many in your party?
- Four, ok?

263
00:25:49,712 --> 00:25:51,112
Come on in ladies.
- Thank you.

264
00:27:56,225 --> 00:28:00,665
We have no Trent, man? Didn't he get in?
- I don't know. He's right behind us, wasn't he?

265
00:28:03,609 --> 00:28:04,609
Excuse me!

266
00:28:04,735 --> 00:28:08,455
What do you guys make, make like what, ten bucks an hour?
- Hey no, it's a night job, buddy.

267
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,860
Oh, yeah, what are you doing on fucking days? Selling Groscard cookies?
Bake sails?

268
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:20,359
Provide newspapers? - Ey, you know what, I won't let you in,
even if I wanted you in. You're dressed like a fucking morron.

269
00:28:20,586 --> 00:28:21,586
Fuck you, man!

270
00:28:23,798 --> 00:28:28,198
Hey, don't forget your golf clubs next time!
- Posers!

271
00:28:29,304 --> 00:28:32,104
Is Sara the one in the miniskirt?

272
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:39,502
She is fucking terrific, man!

273
00:29:16,396 --> 00:29:18,716
Mikey! Three please... thank you.

274
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:28,780
Hey man, I want that Sara chick.
You'll know what I'm saying if you look at that shit.

275
00:29:29,161 --> 00:29:33,641
She's taken bro', alright?
- By who? The charlatan next to you? Please.

276
00:29:55,064 --> 00:29:57,824
Barkeep, shot please.

277
00:29:58,109 --> 00:30:00,989
Shot of what?
- Tequila.

278
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:51,567
Aright. Let's go to work.

279
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:11,372
I think I will try. - Thank you.
- Thank you Whitney!

280
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:16,631
Shots comming aroung. Shots, boys.

281
00:31:38,928 --> 00:31:44,288
I forgot, so what is it you got... an inspiring actress or...?
- Yeah. - That's great.

282
00:31:44,685 --> 00:31:46,765
And you're the director?
- Right, right.

283
00:31:47,021 --> 00:31:52,221
Well, I am available for sex.
- That would be wonderful, you know actually, you're perfect.

284
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:58,770
The guy over there has a number of different identities he can afford.
I'll be right back sweetie. - Ok.

285
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:53,529
There's something really basic and biological, I think,
about letting someone into your body.

286
00:32:55,429 --> 00:32:57,749
You know, there is a... certain...

287
00:32:59,726 --> 00:33:02,806
Loss of control.
Comes with that.

288
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:10,139
Sometimes you don't want to be in control.
Sometimes you just want to loose control

289
00:33:14,324 --> 00:33:16,564
I don't want to get hurt by a woman.

290
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:23,427
So if I want to break down the wall, let her into the psyche, into the heart...
it's got to be the right person.

291
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:30,481
It... it's not a big deal to figure out who you wanna fuck.

292
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:35,683
But who you want to love either.
How do you figure that out?

293
00:34:17,018 --> 00:34:19,978
Two for the road. Thank you.
Let's get out of here.

294
00:34:23,526 --> 00:34:26,286
< Domo arigato> Miss Roboto.

295
00:34:33,036 --> 00:34:37,756
Penorisi. Have another cocktail, why don't you?
Jesus Christ!

296
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:57,507
Men have sex, right?
Women have sex. Sure.

297
00:34:58,731 --> 00:35:03,571
People fuck... it's absolutely correct.
But here is the thing...

298
00:35:04,529 --> 00:35:07,409
Here is the thing in a nutshell...

299
00:35:09,326 --> 00:35:14,246
Sex without love
equals violence.

300
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:19,744
Sex without love
equals violence.

301
00:35:20,087 --> 00:35:25,447
There is no way around it.
Sex without love equals violence.

302
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,840
good sex,
bad sex

303
00:36:48,267 --> 00:36:50,667
This isn't funny.

304
00:37:11,711 --> 00:37:13,751
I have issues.

305
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:23,105
Well, at least you realize that you need to get youself some treatment.
- Dude, this clothes smell like fucking garbage.

306
00:37:24,724 --> 00:37:27,564
I can smell it from here.

307
00:37:27,853 --> 00:37:31,813
You clothes spent a night on the corner
of Florence and Normandy.

308
00:37:32,149 --> 00:37:34,309
Wilshire and 6th.

309
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:40,249
What the hell is on Wilshire and 6th?
- Trust me. Absolutely nothing.

310
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:46,671
Where the hell have you been all night?
- Oh dude, you have no idea.

311
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:52,048
You've seen my Vicodin?
- No.

312
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:59,330
Thanks Trent, that's nice, now I know what to think of
before I try to come.

313
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,440
Who's that dude at the club last night...
that had all the bodyguards?

314
00:38:08,272 --> 00:38:10,192
Some moviestar, I think.

315
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:14,481
Who's he freaking out about?
- Penorisi.

316
00:38:14,822 --> 00:38:17,942
Penorisi got into a fight with one of the bodyguards.

317
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:23,209
Wait here, I'm going to sign out.
- Sara!

318
00:38:27,418 --> 00:38:30,818
Here, I will make you feel better.
Baby you don't look so good. - I'm okay.

319
00:38:32,633 --> 00:38:35,073
I left the jacket there with that guy.

320
00:38:35,344 --> 00:38:37,824
Take it easy, a?
- You look cute.

321
00:38:38,097 --> 00:38:43,777
Hey, here's the jacket. What's up Shawn, where've you been
all night big guy? I've been looking all over for you.

322
00:38:44,896 --> 00:38:47,016
We're out of here!

323
00:38:49,943 --> 00:38:57,783
The lead bodyguard, he's a... comes crashing to the dancefloor...
cut a little swaft through the crowd.

324
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:04,324
Penorisi, Jesus, have another cocktail, why don't you?

325
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:10,347
I've see the whole thing developing, so of course my puty ass makes away.
Here's your Vicodin.

326
00:39:12,301 --> 00:39:17,581
These guys were beasts.
- Yeah, no they weren't small... make yourself useful there will you?

327
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:20,733
No, they weren't small.

328
00:39:22,187 --> 00:39:27,707
That bodyguard couldn't get through, he came right to Mike
and pushed him... while Sara was still up on his shoulders

329
00:39:27,945 --> 00:39:31,465
Penorisi, Jesus, have another cocktail, why don't you?

330
00:39:34,367 --> 00:39:35,887
You man, get the fuck off the way.

331
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:43,032
So what happened?
- She fell right over the bar. Did you hear about that?

332
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,462
Give it to me.
You're alright?

333
00:39:58,768 --> 00:39:59,768
Excuse me...

334
00:40:02,731 --> 00:40:04,491
Come on!
- Let's go!

335
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:07,036
Outside. Right now!

336
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:04,241
Gonna make me your bitch?

337
00:41:11,349 --> 00:41:12,749
Try to make me do it?

338
00:41:15,936 --> 00:41:17,696
Enough!

339
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,480
What happened to you?
- Nothing.

340
00:42:44,158 --> 00:42:45,998
Nothing.

341
00:42:47,788 --> 00:42:49,828
You're okay?

342
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:54,168
Sure.

343
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,480
You want some?
- No, I don't drink.

344
00:42:59,551 --> 00:43:01,391
Me either.

345
00:43:18,863 --> 00:43:21,663
We better go back inside.

346
00:44:21,849 --> 00:44:28,289
Sometimes there's just this need to come...
that just... something that takes over.

347
00:44:28,731 --> 00:44:33,891
It really doesn't matter who, when, where or how... actualy.
It's actually not even about that. It's just...

348
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:37,069
...about coming.

349
00:44:52,174 --> 00:44:56,654
The thing about it is this:
If a guy wants to come, he comes.

350
00:44:57,013 --> 00:45:01,013
With a woman it takes a little bit of effort.

351
00:45:01,351 --> 00:45:05,031
So, that's the least you can do,
it's... make the effort.

352
00:45:12,446 --> 00:45:18,126
It's what women don't get, alright?
Guys like eating pussy. I speak for myself.

353
00:45:18,536 --> 00:45:24,456
I like to take the paper bag down there and just huff. Ok?
I can do fucking spreadsheets down there.

354
00:45:24,877 --> 00:45:27,757
Some women won't let you.
It can be a real issue with them.

355
00:45:29,632 --> 00:45:33,552
But I tell you, I got to have that in my arsenal,
otherwise I'm... I'm out of there.

356
00:45:34,971 --> 00:45:37,091
Just enjoy it too much.

357
00:45:51,531 --> 00:45:55,771
I watch that. I hear them thinking, oh shit,
he's doing me, I got to do him.

358
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:01,840
They think that's something we don't like. But I ask you this:
is this something you would if you did not like it?

359
00:46:13,847 --> 00:46:18,647
I have this ongoing discussion with my girlfriends,
about whether oral sex is sex or...

360
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,780
whether it's just a part of making up.

361
00:46:33,035 --> 00:46:36,675
There's a wholeness of sexual acts that just
don't count as far as I'm concerned..

362
00:46:36,998 --> 00:46:40,918
One is a blowjob... especially with someone you don't suit with.

363
00:46:41,252 --> 00:46:46,412
Another would be... having sex in a foreign country
while on vacation. That doesn't count either.

364
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,080
But kissing someone you really like... that counts.

365
00:46:56,936 --> 00:47:00,696
When woman has an orgasm, it's like a...
it's like a fucking earthquake, right?

366
00:47:01,024 --> 00:47:04,824
I was doing this one Bertha, I swear to God
it was like a 7.5.

367
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:09,033
It's like I'm looking at my dick and...
Jesus why can't you do that?

368
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:16,048
I know some guys who... hide it when they come.

369
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:19,447
They literally... don't make a sound.

370
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:23,584
I mean, some women pretend that they're
coming when they are not.

371
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:27,403
But some men pretend they are not coming
when they are.

372
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:18,858
You're...

373
00:48:19,985 --> 00:48:20,985
What?

374
00:48:21,237 --> 00:48:22,997
You're alright?

375
00:48:26,743 --> 00:48:28,223
Yeah... that was...
- Yeah...

376
00:48:43,178 --> 00:48:44,898
I better run...
- Yeah.

377
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,294
Oh, Em, hey...

378
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:56,350
What's wrong?

379
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,440
I don't know.

380
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:06,101
I don't know.

381
00:50:08,021 --> 00:50:10,741
I just get too drunk.

382
00:50:14,779 --> 00:50:19,339
You ordered like... three bottles of red last night,
didn't you?

383
00:50:21,577 --> 00:50:26,057
It wasn't all for me.
- Yeah I know but I...

384
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:33,705
I think maybe you should have just a glass
from now on and I mean...

385
00:50:35,301 --> 00:50:42,501
You know it's not real... attractive... when you walk all night
with a bottle in your hand.

386
00:50:52,195 --> 00:50:55,475
Come down to the gym with me.
We gotta get that poison out of you.

387
00:50:55,781 --> 00:51:00,141
When are you gonna figure me out?
I need grease.

388
00:51:02,247 --> 00:51:05,607
I need fries... and a big gope.

389
00:51:11,216 --> 00:51:14,816
Please go with me. I hate going by myself.

390
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:33,323
At least you slept in a bed last night.

391
00:51:33,615 --> 00:51:36,175
Where did you sleep?
- Fucking ghetto.

392
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:41,131
Which one?
- Dude, I past on it, alright... no money.

393
00:51:41,498 --> 00:51:47,178
Must have been like a car accident or something, I don't exactly know
what happened cause... then I wake up.

394
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:16,660
Next thing I know I'm on a strech on my way
to the emergency room.

395
00:52:16,996 --> 00:52:22,556
They tought you're one of the guys in the car accident?
- That thought I flew out of the window.

396
00:52:24,003 --> 00:52:25,363
What did you do?

397
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:33,885
I went with them. Cause they... you know...
well they were going north, but...

398
00:52:34,932 --> 00:52:40,372
I got out and... I made a couple of blocks but...
dude I had lied on it, I just couldn't walk.

399
00:52:42,107 --> 00:52:43,107
Jesus Trent...

400
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:50,150
Why do you drink to troubling yourself into...
never seen anything like it.

401
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:54,574
Last night was like nothing I've ever seen.

402
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:57,831
How did you get home?
- I don't know.

403
00:52:58,959 --> 00:53:01,879
I walked outside and I ran into Trent.

404
00:53:05,007 --> 00:53:10,287
Oh please... no... tell me you didn't.

405
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,520
What? I mean... he was there and he said he was stranded.

406
00:53:15,893 --> 00:53:19,333
She took you home?
- Dude I pound that, didn't I tell you that?

407
00:53:19,482 --> 00:53:20,482
Shut up!
- I did.

408
00:53:23,735 --> 00:53:27,215
I thought you slept in the ghetto?
- No no, before that.

409
00:53:28,491 --> 00:53:32,011
You made love to Whitney?
- Yeah.

410
00:53:36,249 --> 00:53:37,969
Intercourse?
- Yeah.

411
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:44,827
Your penis penetrated her vagina?
- Yeah what... dude we had sex, so... yeah.

412
00:54:11,496 --> 00:54:13,456
Hey, blondgirl.

413
00:54:15,918 --> 00:54:17,278
Blondgirl!

414
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,217
Blondgirl.

415
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:38,485
So then what did you do?
- I searched her proper for a fucking rubber, that's what I do.

416
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:43,697
Dude I don't have one in my wallet, I didn't see one laying around.
- What do you expect... a drawer full?

417
00:54:44,032 --> 00:54:48,152
No. You know what I thought?
Chicks have to start getting prepared, man.

418
00:54:48,496 --> 00:54:51,336
I can't be responsible for everything.

419
00:54:51,624 --> 00:54:56,304
But I'm ready to put a fucking sandwich bag on my dick,
that's how horney I am.

420
00:54:56,671 --> 00:55:00,591
You're not getting.
- Dude, come on, you never did that before?

421
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:04,165
No, I see no concept of what you're talking about.

422
00:55:04,471 --> 00:55:07,711
You take a sandwich bag, you slap in on your cock
as fast you have ever been.

423
00:55:08,017 --> 00:55:12,737
That's the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I didn't do that every time I had a condom.

424
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:18,546
She can't figure out what's on my penis, alright.
And I wanna get laid, right? I am going to get laid.

425
00:55:19,863 --> 00:55:24,743
So I check a medicine cabin... though
I had to do it first but...

426
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,519
...what I find is even better than baggies.
Better than baggies? - Yeah.

427
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:32,995
Alka Seltzer.
- What the hell are you talking about?

428
00:55:33,294 --> 00:55:39,974
This is good alright. You take a pack of Alka Seltzer... right in front of her,
so she can see it.

429
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:45,988
You tear it open, and then you
pretend to put it on as it were a condom.

430
00:55:46,392 --> 00:55:50,512
Wind up and get to go. She thinks she's protected...
it's dark and he can't tell shit from shine over.

431
00:55:50,855 --> 00:55:54,015
And this works?
- Dude I don't know, I didn't even had the chance to try it.

432
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,840
Hey, blondgirl.

433
00:56:05,121 --> 00:56:07,201
What the hell is that?

434
00:56:08,875 --> 00:56:11,115
Keep the watch.

435
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,716
Oh my God look at you!

436
00:56:16,676 --> 00:56:18,556
Ok, where we're going?

437
00:56:20,597 --> 00:56:25,117
Oh that's good. Little lower'd be good too.
Yeah right there.

438
00:56:26,228 --> 00:56:27,588
Ok, that's low enough.

439
00:56:28,146 --> 00:56:31,706
I don't mind being tied up.
It is dangerous. It's about control.

440
00:56:32,025 --> 00:56:36,065
I like that, I need that.
Locked up very big like that.

441
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:40,765
No, I haven't been lucky enough to be tied up yet.

442
00:56:42,537 --> 00:56:44,097
But I am still young.

443
00:56:44,331 --> 00:56:46,251
What's your name anyway?

444
00:56:47,918 --> 00:56:51,118
You dirty little whore.
Oh, that's good.

445
00:56:51,422 --> 00:56:58,062
Bondage is ok. I can get me do that. But I don't know about spankink...
I just... I would feel ridiculous.

446
00:57:01,516 --> 00:57:04,196
I'm gonna make you pay for that.

447
00:57:09,525 --> 00:57:15,085
Hot wax is good.
Feathers are good. Ice can be good.

448
00:57:16,992 --> 00:57:19,272
Fuck what was that movie?

449
00:57:19,536 --> 00:57:25,376
More and more guys are into this. I mean, I didn't have any idea
it was such a turn on.

450
00:57:34,386 --> 00:57:37,666
Oh that's good. Yeah. Little lower.

451
00:57:40,476 --> 00:57:43,036
Oh you wouldn't...
Oh you would!

452
00:57:44,772 --> 00:57:47,652
I mean I didn't even know that this had a name.

453
00:57:47,942 --> 00:57:52,262
Around the world... rimming, butt sucking...
whatever you want to call it.

454
00:57:53,949 --> 00:57:55,309
How do you do?

455
00:57:55,534 --> 00:57:59,374
Shakespeare said of this:
Her tongue in your tail.

456
00:58:01,165 --> 00:58:04,285
I'm sorry, I'm not... I'm not sure what we're talking about here?

457
00:58:06,379 --> 00:58:11,619
I think that penetration is interesting for everybody.
I mean even for men.

458
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:16,930
Because... the prostata is like a g-spot.

459
00:58:17,308 --> 00:58:21,508
And when a man comes close to orgasm
it is the same thing.

460
00:58:21,855 --> 00:58:23,655
I mean the pressure is applied.

461
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:35,030
Yes officer! ID's in the glove compartment.

462
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:38,971
A little finger action of the but at the right moment?
Fuck yeah!

463
00:58:46,715 --> 00:58:52,675
The best thing is... that I still get the Alka Seltzer...
you know that's good right now.

464
00:59:02,107 --> 00:59:03,107
Thank's dude.

465
00:59:13,369 --> 00:59:16,649
Where have you been?
I've been callling you all morning.

466
00:59:21,378 --> 00:59:23,458
How's your hang over?

467
00:59:29,637 --> 00:59:31,517
Mine, too.

468
00:59:34,977 --> 00:59:39,857
I've been at hospital all night.
- Why?

469
00:59:40,232 --> 00:59:43,112
I don't know how to say this, but
something happened to Sara last night.

470
00:59:57,376 --> 00:59:59,416
What did he do Sara? Tell me.

471
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:04,263
Just leave us alone, God, don't you see you're
making her worse. Just get out of here.

472
01:00:04,926 --> 01:00:06,846
Here honey, go. Sit down for a second.
It's okay.

473
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:12,277
She went to the police. She's charging him.
For the rape.

474
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,522
Oh my God!
I knew something was wrong.

475
01:00:16,856 --> 01:00:19,656
Where is he now?
- He's in jail.

476
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:25,142
The cops picked him up at some burger join afterwards.
Grabed him for a fucking burger.

477
01:00:28,326 --> 01:00:30,606
The police coming...

478
01:00:34,709 --> 01:00:36,269
Hurry, hurry.

479
01:00:43,635 --> 01:00:45,355
Does he have a weapon?

480
01:00:49,267 --> 01:00:51,747
Don't move or got damage!

481
01:00:55,356 --> 01:00:59,796
Give me a couple of seconds, fellows.
My fries are almost up.

482
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:05,930
Do you want it?

483
01:01:09,789 --> 01:01:13,069
Jesus Christ, don't tell me you believe
this fucking bullshit?

484
01:01:14,043 --> 01:01:17,723
Why shouldn't we, big boy?
- Stop calling me big boy, you fat fuck!

485
01:01:17,883 --> 01:01:18,883
Mike, be polite.

486
01:01:20,092 --> 01:01:26,012
Pondered her face against the head port? Jesus!
She must have given you two quite an incredible performance.

487
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:31,592
At least she talked to us. She didn't need a God damn lawyer.
- Not being accused of anything asshole!

488
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:32,814
Mike stop it, please!

489
01:01:33,022 --> 01:01:36,742
Excuse me.
If he wants to talk, let him talk.

490
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:40,869
Hey, she told she's an actress, right?
Studies in Beverly Hills, did she tell you that?

491
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:46,079
We know all about her.
- We want to know about you... besides what we hear on ESPN.

492
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:51,214
I think you could be nominated for a freacken Academy Award.
- Mike, would you please shut the fuck up!

493
01:01:51,585 --> 01:01:54,785
Look, an attorney will be here
within moments for my fellow, if you just...

494
01:01:55,089 --> 01:01:59,769
No no no! I got my rights.
I did not rape Sara... what's her face? Ok?

495
01:02:01,011 --> 01:02:06,371
While feminist bitches might say otherwise,
they don't know shit, they think holding hands is a freaking rape.

496
01:02:06,768 --> 01:02:10,808
Mike, look, I'm sorry, but you're a fucking idiot!
Listen to yourself!

497
01:02:25,289 --> 01:02:29,089
Ok, here's the tale. This is the way it happened.

498
01:02:30,711 --> 01:02:36,111
Sara, what's her face, and I go down by the water.
Down by her place.

499
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:52,340
We're kissing, we're hooking up, we're making out...
This girl is all over me, all over me.

500
01:03:53,552 --> 01:03:57,752
Then what happened?
- It starts to rain. She wants to go inside, so we did.

501
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,860
Come on, let's get out of here!

502
01:04:16,327 --> 01:04:18,087
I'm leaving.
- Oh no.

503
01:04:19,122 --> 01:04:22,202
Going home, good night, thank you very much, good night.
- Good night.

504
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:25,962
Me so tired.

505
01:04:48,446 --> 01:04:50,366
Harder, harder.

506
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,679
And you didn't make any moves before you went to the bedroom?
- Yeah, I kissed her probably, normal stuff.

507
01:04:56,037 --> 01:05:01,917
Hickeys all over her neck. - Only because this psycho begged me to.
She wanted that marks on her neck, to show her stupid boyfriend.

508
01:05:07,467 --> 01:05:14,507
Look. She takes off my clothes. I take off hers.
One thing leads to another. And we fuck.

509
01:05:15,475 --> 01:05:18,915
Not all this whore shit that I forced myself on her,
come on man, I play for the Raiders.

510
01:05:19,229 --> 01:05:22,909
Here we go, you can get a piece of ass anytime you like, right?

511
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:27,005
She never said no, alright?

512
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:30,600
She said a lot of things, but none of them sounded like no.

513
01:05:30,909 --> 01:05:34,189
Mike, stick to the specifics, please.
- Fuck specifics, Rick! Fuck them!

514
01:05:35,413 --> 01:05:37,253
I want to say this.

515
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:42,300
On behalf of all the guys who have to deal with this shit
and these two cops know what I'm talking about, they've been there.

516
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:43,506
Shit, we all have.

517
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:51,660
You go out with some chick, right? And she says
nothing's gonna happen, right? Wrong.

518
01:05:53,267 --> 01:06:00,947
What do you do... you warm her up with a little forplay. You show her that
no way this is gonna be a one night stand, and before you know, you're fucking caved.

519
01:06:01,442 --> 01:06:07,402
They are doing the horizontal shuffle on their lovin'
every 30 seconds of it. And it's always the same old story.

520
01:06:07,824 --> 01:06:13,544
Oh my God! Nothing is gonna happen, ok. I can't do this. Oh my God!
Oh my God, go get a condom.

521
01:06:13,956 --> 01:06:20,596
Good yes. We don't have one? That's ok we don't need one.
I can't believe I'm doing this. I'm such a good girl. Oh God, I never do this.

522
01:06:21,089 --> 01:06:24,529
Look, can we stop this now?
- Let him talk for Christ sake!

523
01:06:24,843 --> 01:06:27,923
Mike... I can't believe you're in your fucking grave here Mike.

524
01:06:31,392 --> 01:06:36,192
What did I do wrong Rick?
You tell me what did I do wrong.

525
01:07:36,255 --> 01:07:40,415
Sara asked me if I had protection.
I said I didn't.

526
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:47,360
So I'm expecting she's gonna say, no glove no love.
She hasn't say a thing.

527
01:07:52,814 --> 01:07:55,974
Have you a condoom?
- No, no, I'm sorry.

528
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:39,790
She wanted me, I wanted her.

529
01:08:55,466 --> 01:08:59,786
Ok? What happened? You hit your head? -Yeah.
- You're alright? - Yes, let us stop.

530
01:09:12,902 --> 01:09:15,622
Alright. That's it. Pull down.

531
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:19,785
Hey, cowboy!
- We're done.

532
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:23,277
We're not done untill we say it's done.

533
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:30,427
She was crazy, man.
She looks normal but deep down she is... God!

534
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:36,716
Yapping about her old boyfriend the whole time... begging me to
suck her neck. The whole time I'm thinking...

535
01:09:37,096 --> 01:09:39,936
...this chick is a fucking psycho.

536
01:09:43,102 --> 01:09:47,782
She wanted to get back at this Keith for dumping her.

537
01:09:59,454 --> 01:10:04,534
There is another reason why did she get so upset.
And this is sick in the head.

538
01:10:06,253 --> 01:10:09,533
Sure you don't wanna come? How would you not be starving?
- I'm positive.

539
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:13,760
Right before I left her place to get a fucking cheeseburger...

540
01:10:14,095 --> 01:10:16,055
Good night, Whitney.

541
01:10:17,307 --> 01:10:19,187
I called her own name.

542
01:10:19,434 --> 01:10:22,034
Just get the fuck out. Whitney. Get the fuck out!

543
01:10:22,312 --> 01:10:23,632
I called her Whitney.

544
01:10:23,688 --> 01:10:25,969
Get the fuck out of here! God damn it!

545
01:10:28,611 --> 01:10:35,251
And that's why we are here.
Because I mistook her for one of her dope friends.

546
01:10:51,844 --> 01:10:52,844
Oh, shit!

547
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:05,340
What do we know about Sara?
- Just what she said when I took her to the hospital.

548
01:11:05,693 --> 01:11:11,253
Is she okay?
- She has a... like a bump here with a cut...

549
01:11:11,658 --> 01:11:15,498
And here she has some cuts...
some hickies on the neck

550
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:21,619
Sara, I am dr. Cook. -Quietly.
- It's ok.

551
01:11:25,924 --> 01:11:30,004
It's alright.
It's just the doctor, she's just gonna help you.

552
01:11:31,346 --> 01:11:35,706
It is a safe place. Come sit. Sara you're on a safe place.
- Just stop!

553
01:11:37,102 --> 01:11:38,302
Come sit, alright?

554
01:11:38,438 --> 01:11:41,398
Now the three of us are gonna take off
your jacket together, ok?

555
01:11:55,081 --> 01:12:00,361
Excuse me, nurse. Can her father give us a statement, please?
Can wespeak to Mr. Olswang? - Stand back, please!

556
01:12:02,756 --> 01:12:05,956
I thought I could trust him, you know.

557
01:12:07,093 --> 01:12:12,973
I thought that he would never do something like this,
he'd never want to screw up his carrier like this.

558
01:12:13,392 --> 01:12:15,632
Alright, that's... that's enough.
- I'm sorry, but we have...

559
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:22,016
No, don't tell me you're sorry! You're not sorry, you don't know what sorry is!
Sorry is when the son of the bitch is in jail for the rest of his life.

560
01:12:22,777 --> 01:12:23,777
Sir...

561
01:12:24,113 --> 01:12:26,433
Would you like to wait outside, sir?

562
01:12:30,703 --> 01:12:32,303
It's okay.
- Yeah.

563
01:12:34,415 --> 01:12:37,255
You're sure?
- You're alright?

564
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:41,756
I'm okay.

565
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:46,630
I wish just... really scared.

566
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:58,176
We got back to my apartment...

567
01:12:58,525 --> 01:13:03,605
...around 3... 3:15.

568
01:13:06,618 --> 01:13:09,618
We walked down, by the ocean road.

569
01:14:02,345 --> 01:14:06,985
He was very aggressive.
Then it started to rain.

570
01:14:11,439 --> 01:14:14,639
Come on! We go to your place.

571
01:14:14,942 --> 01:14:18,102
So, just to get out of there we went back to my appartment.

572
01:14:27,456 --> 01:14:30,056
Look, you should go, it's late...

573
01:14:30,334 --> 01:14:35,614
No, wait, please... one second, one second please,
I'm showered to the bone, come here!

574
01:14:37,592 --> 01:14:39,792
We got together a little bit.

575
01:14:41,805 --> 01:14:46,565
It was okay. Except his breath made me kind a noxious.

576
01:14:50,189 --> 01:14:52,509
A lot of boosts?

577
01:15:00,451 --> 01:15:04,411
He tried to deal my bra.

578
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:09,467
But... he was so wasted that I had to do it myself.

579
01:15:09,836 --> 01:15:13,556
Get this thing off, get this thing off!
- Yeah yeah, I'll take it off, ok, i'll take it off.

580
01:15:17,678 --> 01:15:23,838
I didn't mind that, cause I knew I wasn't
gonna let him go any further.

581
01:15:24,894 --> 01:15:28,854
I just wanted to do to sleep.
- Where were you at this time?

582
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:34,479
My apartment.

583
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:39,619
Where in your appartment?
- The living room.

584
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:42,537
Ok.

585
01:15:56,429 --> 01:16:01,229
He started getting out of control.

586
01:16:03,645 --> 01:16:10,965
He shrugged his hand off my skirt.
He kept saying that he was really horney though.

587
01:16:14,282 --> 01:16:17,802
And that he was gonna get off with or without me.

588
01:16:18,119 --> 01:16:20,159
Leave!
- Please, I'm gonna get off with or without you.

589
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:24,094
I told him that it would definitely be without me.

590
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:37,690
So then he took me...

591
01:16:38,058 --> 01:16:43,618
and grabbed me... and dragged me into my room.

592
01:16:45,900 --> 01:16:52,220
And threw me on the bed...
like I was some kind of fucking football doll.

593
01:17:19,562 --> 01:17:22,522
He pulled my panties aside.

594
01:17:30,031 --> 01:17:33,751
He stabbed it between my legs and he...

595
01:17:34,327 --> 01:17:37,927
I couldn't stop him,
I tried it.

596
01:18:08,490 --> 01:18:12,450
A few minutes went by...

597
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:20,664
...and he had that orgasm...
and then he left.

598
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:43,140
Have we got evidence of penetration?
- Yes we do, officer.

599
01:18:43,446 --> 01:18:45,126
Semen?
- Yes.

600
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:53,361
Can we have a minute?
Please, Mr. Olswang.

601
01:19:03,675 --> 01:19:08,555
This is not gonna be easy.
- This guy, Penorisi, he's got a high profile.

602
01:19:08,932 --> 01:19:11,332
I don't care if he's God damn Joe Montana.

603
01:19:50,602 --> 01:19:52,242
What's up bro?

604
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,440
Dude, what's happening?

605
01:19:56,693 --> 01:20:02,973
That Mike guy... supposedly... raped Sara last night.

606
01:20:06,411 --> 01:20:07,411
Oh, holy fuck.

607
01:20:13,085 --> 01:20:15,045
Dude, I'm sorry.

608
01:20:19,133 --> 01:20:20,133
Jesus Christ!

609
01:20:20,885 --> 01:20:23,685
I should have done something, I mean...

610
01:20:25,307 --> 01:20:29,827
I should have stopped her from getting in the car with him.

611
01:20:30,896 --> 01:20:33,776
Oh, yeah... oh, dude, I can see that happen.

612
01:20:36,402 --> 01:20:40,562
I can totally see that guy doing something like that.

613
01:20:43,035 --> 01:20:44,035
Fuck!

614
01:20:50,501 --> 01:20:51,981
Fuck, what happens now?

615
01:20:53,796 --> 01:20:59,396
I meet a woman in a bar.
She says to me: I'm not wearing any underwear.

616
01:20:59,804 --> 01:21:04,124
What am I supposed to think?
I'm gonna think she's gonna come across.

617
01:21:04,475 --> 01:21:08,635
Women head on me all the time.
And they are not interested in my mind.

618
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:15,360
There's something about having sex forced on you.
That does cut the chase.

619
01:21:17,406 --> 01:21:20,166
You're having taken your responsability for him.

620
01:21:21,494 --> 01:21:26,774
I'm talking about fantasies now.
This is not an invitation to rape.

621
01:21:29,669 --> 01:21:34,109
I'm just saying... that's why the rape fantasy's so appealing.

622
01:21:35,634 --> 01:21:41,394
When you're a kid it's a game.
First base, second base, third base.

623
01:21:41,807 --> 01:21:46,047
And if a guy hits a homerun with a girl
then he's a winner.

624
01:21:47,522 --> 01:21:49,562
And she's a slut.

625
01:21:51,778 --> 01:21:54,378
It really ain't different now.

626
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,323
Just came right from the station.
- Yeah, thanks bud.

627
01:22:07,962 --> 01:22:11,242
Here's the grand.
- No, no, it's alright, thanks.

628
01:22:24,897 --> 01:22:26,257
Where is she?

629
01:22:26,482 --> 01:22:30,202
And I don't give a shit,
I want his fucking neck broken.

630
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:38,498
Hey, look me in the eye. - Ok.
- And just tell the truth. - Ok.

631
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:43,915
With all these lawyers you have to be strait. - Yeah.
- You have to have your stories strait.

632
01:22:44,252 --> 01:22:45,732
Yeah, I hear you.

633
01:22:55,555 --> 01:22:59,515
I tell you boys, don't tell me how tough it is,
I want to know what makes his dick hard.

634
01:23:00,770 --> 01:23:01,770
It's okay.

635
01:23:08,444 --> 01:23:13,524
Hi sweetheart. - Hi.
- We need to talk for a second, ok? Come here.

636
01:23:15,619 --> 01:23:18,939
We're charged with one kind of sexual assault
and one kind of rape.

637
01:23:19,248 --> 01:23:22,808
That's twenty years per count in State of California.
That's just what you're up against.

638
01:23:23,127 --> 01:23:27,927
Everything that you've ever done in your life
will be dug up and used against you.

639
01:23:28,300 --> 01:23:30,780
But you have to know your side of the story,
then you have to let them go after her.

640
01:23:31,053 --> 01:23:34,613
What do you think they're gonna dig up on me Jane?
- Dear, what would they ask?

641
01:23:34,932 --> 01:23:37,812
What does it matter what they fucking ask?
The guy is a son of the bitch who should be executed.

642
01:23:38,102 --> 01:23:42,382
Yeah, we know that, Emma, but if you knew anything
about how a legal system works, you'd know that's not the issue.

643
01:23:42,732 --> 01:23:46,652
The issue is if she was raped. How do you prove that
in a court of law, that is the issue.

644
01:23:46,987 --> 01:23:50,867
If? If I was raped?

645
01:23:55,247 --> 01:24:00,367
Yeah, Jane. Ask me.
Ask me what you think that they would ask.

646
01:24:00,752 --> 01:24:03,752
How did you get home?
- We took a cab to her place.

647
01:24:04,048 --> 01:24:06,208
Who paid for it?
- I did.

648
01:24:06,466 --> 01:24:10,706
It's a long ride to Santa Monica. How much was it?
- 25 dollars, with the tip.

649
01:24:11,055 --> 01:24:14,935
Pre-eve of your paying for the cab right on, what exactly did you think was gona happen?

650
01:24:15,268 --> 01:24:19,908
So what happened when you got there?
- We went down to the beach. - And...?

651
01:24:21,608 --> 01:24:23,448
And... we got together... I guess.

652
01:24:23,694 --> 01:24:26,974
No no, Mike, how did you get together? Did you kissed?
Did you balled her? Did you fuck her in the sand?

653
01:24:27,281 --> 01:24:30,001
What? You got to tell me.
- We kissed and...

654
01:24:30,285 --> 01:24:34,325
He kissed you where? Standind up? Sitting down?
- Down. We were down in the sand.

655
01:24:34,664 --> 01:24:38,504
And?
- And... we dry-humped.

656
01:24:38,835 --> 01:24:42,115
What is that mean?
- We had sex with our clothes on.

657
01:24:44,008 --> 01:24:44,808
Okay.

658
01:24:44,842 --> 01:24:47,602
And it started to rain,
and she wanted to go inside.

659
01:24:47,887 --> 01:24:51,727
And then you went back to the appartment?
- And he came inside.

660
01:24:52,059 --> 01:24:54,859
Ok, so you were inside the appartment?
What happened next?

661
01:24:55,145 --> 01:25:00,185
I was little drunk, Jane.
- Have you ever been really drunk?

662
01:25:02,987 --> 01:25:04,627
What do you mean?

663
01:25:07,492 --> 01:25:13,092
Well, have you ever had a black-out? - Jane!
A lapse in your memory. Do you know what a black-out is, don't you?

664
01:25:13,498 --> 01:25:16,538
Jane don't.
- Why not?

665
01:25:16,835 --> 01:25:20,195
Alright, look, you started making love. Then what happened?

666
01:25:27,597 --> 01:25:32,437
I don't know. - What do you mean?
- I don't know what happened.

667
01:25:33,813 --> 01:25:38,293
I don't understand you.
- Passed on hard, Ricky, and then I can't remember.

668
01:25:38,651 --> 01:25:42,371
You know what a black-out is, don't you?
- I don't get like that.

669
01:25:42,697 --> 01:25:44,937
What do you say? You don't know?

670
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,368
Okay.

671
01:25:50,832 --> 01:25:52,632
I don't.

672
01:25:54,627 --> 01:26:02,307
Gina Perry's birthday party.
Don't you remember you sort of blacked-out... in the noon party?

673
01:26:08,225 --> 01:26:13,145
What are you doing?
- He writes something on my face.

674
01:26:14,023 --> 01:26:15,343
Hey, fuck of!

675
01:26:15,734 --> 01:26:18,134
Hey honey, why don't we go to the bathroom...

676
01:26:18,403 --> 01:26:21,763
And then the night that you broke up with Keith.

677
01:26:22,074 --> 01:26:27,194
You had alcohol poisoning. We took you to the hospital
and they pumped your stomach.

678
01:26:27,997 --> 01:26:32,677
Don't you remember how mad you were... the next day?

679
01:26:34,129 --> 01:26:41,049
Honey, the court will have records of all that stuff.
- I don't remember.

680
01:26:41,512 --> 01:26:46,432
I didn't rape her, Rick.
I know I didn't rape her.

681
01:26:46,809 --> 01:26:50,289
Did you blacked-out with Mike Penorisi?

682
01:26:54,151 --> 01:26:58,111
Look at me. Look at me.
Sara, look at me.

683
01:27:00,199 --> 01:27:03,119
You didn't blacked-out, did you?

684
01:27:03,411 --> 01:27:09,451
Honey, just look at me. What you told me
in the hospital. That's what really happened, right?

685
01:27:09,876 --> 01:27:13,876
I don't remember, ok?
I'm telling you, I don't remember.

686
01:27:14,214 --> 01:27:17,174
You want the truth? There it is.

687
01:27:18,344 --> 01:27:19,984
Look at me.

688
01:27:20,846 --> 01:27:24,766
Shut your fucking mouth and you listen to me!
I understand your plaintive sympathise.

689
01:27:25,102 --> 01:27:30,462
But I'm telling you right now brother, as your friend...
The judge in the jury are gonna throw the book at 'I don't remember'!

690
01:27:30,858 --> 01:27:34,378
My mind's blank, man.
- Yeah, you were really eloquent with the cops last night!

691
01:27:34,530 --> 01:27:35,530
I can't remember.

692
01:27:35,196 --> 01:27:37,356
Look at me and answer the question!

693
01:27:37,949 --> 01:27:39,549
God damn it Michael!

694
01:27:39,618 --> 01:27:42,018
You're accusing somebody of a felony!

695
01:27:42,121 --> 01:27:43,121
I swear to God, you will do prison-time,
unless you remember exactly what happened!

696
01:27:46,625 --> 01:27:48,705
Did you hear this stop!

697
01:28:41,935 --> 01:28:46,495
Jane, are you trying to tell me that
I should just let him walk?

698
01:28:47,567 --> 01:28:50,847
You're a stupid son of a bitch, you know that?

699
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:57,442
What do you want me to say, Ricky?

700
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:04,031
Just tell me what you want me to say and I'll say it.

701
01:29:37,539 --> 01:29:38,539
Alright.

702
01:29:46,882 --> 01:29:50,322
Alright look... let us go through the basics, right?

703
01:29:57,310 --> 01:30:00,590
Now, what happened in the bedroom?

704
01:30:02,524 --> 01:30:05,484
We had sex.
- Ok.

705
01:30:05,778 --> 01:30:09,298
What kind of sex did you have?
- Missionary.

706
01:30:12,368 --> 01:30:17,648
No Mike. Not what position.
Was the sex consented?

707
01:30:18,375 --> 01:30:19,375
Yeah.

708
01:30:19,626 --> 01:30:25,546
So, what kind of sex did you have?
- Consensual sex.

709
01:30:25,967 --> 01:30:29,607
We had consensual sex.
- That's perfect. That's exactly how you say it.

710
01:30:29,929 --> 01:30:34,889
You didn't say yes or indicated any kind of consent, is that right?
- Right.

711
01:30:35,810 --> 01:30:38,930
And that's what you say. Ok?

712
01:30:39,231 --> 01:30:45,071
You told him no. You resisted.
And he forced himself on you.

713
01:30:46,365 --> 01:30:47,365
Yes.

714
01:30:52,788 --> 01:30:55,828
Yeah, that's good. That's really good,
that's exactly what I'll say.

715
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:04,539
No, Mike. You'll say it because it's true.
- It is. Sure, it's true. Rick, it is.

716
01:31:08,221 --> 01:31:11,661
Mike look at me.
It is true isn't it?

717
01:31:15,897 --> 01:31:16,897
Jane...

718
01:31:18,858 --> 01:31:21,818
You still don't believe me, do you?

719
01:31:23,488 --> 01:31:28,528
You don't believe that it really happened.
- Did it Sara?

720
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:32,070
Cause if you say it did, then I believe you.

721
01:31:34,667 --> 01:31:35,667
Sara...

722
01:31:38,630 --> 01:31:39,630
Hey. Hi.

723
01:31:45,595 --> 01:31:48,875
God, I'm so sorry about last night.
- Yeah, me too.

724
01:31:49,183 --> 01:31:52,063
Hey, blondgirl.
- Hey. How is it going?

725
01:31:55,106 --> 01:31:58,386
I should have been looking out for you.

726
01:32:00,529 --> 01:32:02,929
It's okay.

727
01:32:03,198 --> 01:32:06,478
Gonna be alright?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

728
01:32:09,163 --> 01:32:10,923
Who made the first move? She...

729
01:32:24,263 --> 01:32:29,983
Hi, it's Jane. Please leave your name and number and I'll call you back.
- Hi. It's Rick.

730
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:36,913
I'm just calling to say...
I don't know what to say actually...

731
01:32:40,156 --> 01:32:44,756
Cause everything what I want to say will take more time
than I have on this machine.

732
01:32:47,121 --> 01:32:51,281
I just... thought we were close to something.
You and me, you know I...

733
01:32:54,797 --> 01:32:56,637
I just thought we had a chance.

734
01:33:04,348 --> 01:33:06,788
I just... hate to loose that.

735
01:33:12,566 --> 01:33:18,166
So call me, will you?
I Don't want this thing come between us. Please.

736
01:33:20,325 --> 01:33:21,325
Ok. Bye.

737
01:33:55,279 --> 01:33:58,439
It'll be Mike Penorisi date rape case.

738
01:33:58,742 --> 01:34:04,982
Lack of evidence and confuted he-said, she-said testimony
led yesterday to a hung jury in a much publicised trial.

739
01:34:26,105 --> 01:34:32,105
I don't understand people who are afraid of sex.

740
01:34:33,989 --> 01:34:38,589
Because sex is not dangerous.
It's not bad for your.

741
01:34:42,289 --> 01:34:46,409
Here is AIDS, right AIDS... accepted that.

742
01:34:48,379 --> 01:34:53,779
So fine, alright. Let's don't have sex. Why have sex?
Whatever you wanna do, it's not that a big deal.

743
01:34:55,596 --> 01:35:00,236
And you say people that they say what they really want is...
they wanna... they wanna be in love.

744
01:35:00,601 --> 01:35:07,561
I think if you wanna be scared of something
you'd be scared of that shit cause that's... hi-tech.

745
01:35:08,819 --> 01:35:13,499
Yeah, love is dangerous.
But people survive.

746
01:35:16,578 --> 01:35:19,258
There is a... pain...

747
01:35:19,538 --> 01:35:25,498
You have a... compromise and sacrifice and... and hardship.

748
01:35:28,299 --> 01:35:30,459
But it's all just... speed bumps.

749
01:35:30,717 --> 01:35:35,197
I have this nightmare... I have sex with some guy and...

750
01:35:35,557 --> 01:35:39,397
...the next day he won't leave.

751
01:35:40,646 --> 01:35:46,526
He's in... my bedroom and he's in my bathroom and
he's in my serial...

752
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:54,664
...and I just... I can't get rid of him and he just
keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger...

753
01:35:56,788 --> 01:35:58,748
...until I can't breathe.

754
01:35:58,999 --> 01:36:01,959
Yeah... I can separate sex and love.

755
01:36:02,252 --> 01:36:07,812
But I still want to love... you know,
cause it's the love that makes you vulnerable.

756
01:36:08,217 --> 01:36:11,217
It's love that makes you hurt.

757
01:36:14,099 --> 01:36:18,379
And it's the hurt that a... that makes you know...
that you're still alive.

758
01:36:19,563 --> 01:36:23,283
There is always a door
you do not want to open.

759
01:36:23,609 --> 01:36:26,249
Or place you don't wanna go.

760
01:36:27,489 --> 01:36:30,409
A question you don't
wanna answer or...

761
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:34,580
...one word that you just don't wanna hear.

762
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:43,280
Because if you do... you know you'll never be the same.
