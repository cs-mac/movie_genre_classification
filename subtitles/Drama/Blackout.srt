1
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,544
Yeah. Y'all, got them CDs and DVDs.

2
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:35,985
-What's up, baby?
-What's good?

3
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:37,056
-How you?
-Ain't shit.

4
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:38,157
All right.

5
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,282
You got that new
Bad Boys II soundtrack?

6
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,417
Do I? And the shit is fire, dun.

7
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,325
I'm selling out every day
on that right there.

8
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50,062
Yeah, y'all, CDs, DVDs...

9
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:53,867
Man, I told you. You can't be marrying
my sister, you ain't got no paper.

10
00:02:53,973 --> 00:02:54,997
I ain't having it.

11
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,735
What's up, youngblood,
you can't speak?

12
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,776
What's up, man?

13
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:00,675
I'll come holler at you later on.
Let me finish this.

14
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:05,539
Hey, you know what I heard
they pay these chicks in these videos?

15
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,677
Pay them a ham sandwich.

16
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:13,856
They don't get a dime shaking their ass
in the camera like that.

17
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,485
Yeah. I fucked around
with a little video chick one time.

18
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,655
Wait. What?

19
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,829
What do you mean?
You saw her in the club?

20
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:24,529
You bumped into her on the way
to the bathroom in the club?

21
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,729
Come on, man.

22
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:28,966
Quit clowning me, man.
Stay out of my business, all right?

23
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:32,010
I don't love them hos.
I like me a gangster bitch.

24
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,840
Pretty but gangster.
You know what I'm saying?

25
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:35,380
It's all right. It's all right.

26
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:38,211
Fuck that. Yeah, all right.

27
00:03:39,085 --> 00:03:42,384
Damn, son. I'm saying, why don't you
just date dudes, then, man?

28
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,450
-What? Oh.
-Take that ho with you, son.

29
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:49,594
If there ain't no water in here,
I'm telling you I'm gonna be crazy.

30
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:53,097
Tell your mom I'm gonna call her later
about that information.

31
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,997
-Ali. What's good, my man?
-What up, L?

32
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,536
Hey, man, you know me, man.
I'm always good.

33
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,196
Another day, another hustle.

34
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:01,407
I'm about to go to work, so, you know,
came to get my newspaper.

35
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,466
I'm about to go to work, so, you know,
came to get my newspaper.

36
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,635
My water. You know you're running
out of water, right?

37
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,235
You'd better get on your man.

38
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:10,077
And, this bag of chips
and you already know...

39
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,583
A man after my own heart...

40
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:15,944
Yeah. That's fresh. Yeah, I like that.
So how much I owe you?

41
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,249
-$2.50.
-$2.50?

42
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:18,551
-$2.50.
-$2.50?

43
00:04:18,658 --> 00:04:20,819
-It was $2.50 yesterday.
-All right.

44
00:04:21,828 --> 00:04:25,093
Damn. I gotta count this out.
You know what I'm saying?

45
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,927
Ten...

46
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,229
Yo, I'm gonna owe you 30 cents,
all right?

47
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:31,428
-No. No, dude.
-I'm good for it.

48
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,698
What is it you don't understand?
No credit. The sign is right there.

49
00:04:33,806 --> 00:04:36,832
It says, "No credit."
Look, there's even an exclamation point.

50
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,570
Oh, that's what you're talking about.
You want the credit.

51
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,512
-Oh, thank you, Ali...
-No. No, dude, I'm serious.

52
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,604
I can't let you off anymore.

53
00:04:43,716 --> 00:04:45,377
Every day you come in here,
go through your pants

54
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,146
and realize you ain't got no money.

55
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:48,948
Maybe if you counted your money
before you come in here,

56
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:51,023
you realize you don't have enough
to buy what you want.

57
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,059
Come on, man. I come in here
every day. You know what I'm saying?

58
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,492
You're getting rich off us out here.
How you gonna spaz on me with...

59
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:57,961
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

60
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,827
-Who the hell you think is getting rich?
-You!

61
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:02,594
Dude, you think I'd be out here
working 16 hours a day

62
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,999
-if I was getting rich?
-Damn, 16 hours.

63
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,367
That's why we don't accept IOUs.

64
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,906
Man, give me this, man. I'll give you
the 30 cents tomorrow, all right?

65
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:12,466
I was going to be one myself
at one time, you know.

66
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:16,837
Super!
When you gonna fix my sink, man?

67
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:19,050
You come over to my house
from a week ago,

68
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,483
and you don't come back, man.

69
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:22,520
I haven't forgotten about you, Beatrice.

70
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:24,214
As soon as the company
brings the stuff,

71
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,054
you're gonna be first on my list.

72
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:29,754
This man full of shit.

73
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,721
I'll soon report him to me landlord.

74
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,290
Sure. You know how much
they report him already?

75
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,669
-Morning, George.
-Hey.

76
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,640
Good morning, Mrs. Thompson.
Coming from work, I see.

77
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,971
Yes.

78
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,603
-How's CJ?
-Oh, he's fine. Thank you.

79
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:49,841
Figured out which school
he's gonna go to yet?

80
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:51,007
Yes, indeed.

81
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,486
He will be going to Penn State
in the fall. Full academic scholarship.

82
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:57,613
Good Jesus!

83
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:01,524
-I know you must be proud.
-Oh, very much. Very much so.

84
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,655
-Well, I'm not gonna hold you up.
-All right.

85
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,823
I know you gotta go get your rest. Okay?

86
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:11,700
By the way, George. I got a leak coming
down from my ceiling in the bathroom.

87
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:13,237
Could you...

88
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,339
I'll be up there in half an hour.

89
00:06:20,446 --> 00:06:22,175
Maybe just a little bit more. Okay?

90
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:24,272
-Thanks a lot.
-Okay.

91
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,520
-Good morning, ladies.
-Morning!

92
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,651
Did you hear that woman?

93
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:37,024
Bragging about her child,

94
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,690
like he's the only one
doing right or in college.

95
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,563
Did I tell you my son Trevor
got accepted to college, too?

96
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:45,865
Is he? But isn't he about 32?

97
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,701
So what? It ain't never too late.

98
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,173
Thank you.
Anyway, he's taking two night classes

99
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,574
-at Medgar Evers Community College.
-Good for him.

100
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,921
-James!
-Hey, babe, good morning.

101
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,191
Papi, I overslept.
You didn't wake me up.

102
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:14,288
Now I'm late for work.

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,664
Babe, you didn't come to bed
until almost 3:00 this morning.

104
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,669
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't want to bother you.

105
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,763
Besides, I wanted to surprise you
with breakfast in bed.

106
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,603
But my boss is gonna kill me.

107
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,677
Babe, you can work from home.
You do it all the time.

108
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,906
-Hey, how do you want your eggs?
-No, thank you.

109
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:33,507
Man.
She done ruined my whole mack mood.

110
00:07:38,658 --> 00:07:39,955
Oh, hey, Ma.

111
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,789
Hey, handsome.
How was your evening?

112
00:07:42,895 --> 00:07:44,590
It was good.
You know, same old, same old.

113
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:45,823
Well, do you want me
to do something for you?

114
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:47,422
You want me to make you some tea
or something like that?

115
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:50,331
-Oh, could you?
-You know I got you.

116
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:51,698
You're getting ready for work?

117
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,797
Yeah. I'm gonna leave in about
10-15 minutes, something like that.

118
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:58,738
Where is The View?

119
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:01,643
I like that Star Jones.

120
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,451
You going job-hunting today?

121
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,116
Well, I got a lot to do
in the house today.

122
00:08:14,227 --> 00:08:15,854
I don't know yet.

123
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,089
Claudine, hold up.

124
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,030
What?
You don't think I wanna find a job?

125
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,829
No one's saying
that you don't want to find a job.

126
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,133
Well, you think this is easy?
I haven't had a steady job in two years.

127
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,538
-You think I like this shit?
-You don't need to curse at me, James.

128
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,203
-I'm just asking.
-No, no. No, you're not just asking.

129
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:35,473
All right? Nobody's "just asking."

130
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,377
I hate when people say that.

131
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,143
When I got laid off,
the economy was already jacked up.

132
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,723
I mean, how was I to know that

133
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:47,816
the terrorists would drop the bomb
on us, right here in New York.

134
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,335
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, baby.

135
00:08:59,438 --> 00:09:01,770
I see you found your breakfast okay.

136
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,841
-What?
-Got to go.

137
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:04,432
-What?
-Listen, I'm late for work.

138
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,034
I'll be home from work around 7:00,
all right?

139
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:08,375
-Already?
-One sec.

140
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:10,207
-Wait.
-Love you.

141
00:09:10,316 --> 00:09:11,715
Wait, baby, wait.

142
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,277
I wanted to surprise you, but...

143
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,846
I made reservations for us tonight
at the Jazz Lounge.

144
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,048
Jazz Lounge?

145
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,185
I want to celebrate my baby
getting his promotion.

146
00:09:23,829 --> 00:09:26,764
Damn. You know, I tell you, I must have
done something really special

147
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:30,199
in my past life to get loved up
with someone as fine as you.

148
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,998
Nubian queen. I'll tell you.

149
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,664
Look, I got to go.

150
00:09:35,474 --> 00:09:37,999
Hey, have fun on your day off.

151
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,101
First of all, your mother plays Xbox.

152
00:10:07,206 --> 00:10:09,299
My mother has a job.

153
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,410
What took you so long?

154
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,606
I thought you wasn't coming
to see me no more.

155
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:18,741
Is that what you thought?

156
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,581
James, you've been supported
every month, all right?

157
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,355
I'm sorry that I don't
pat you on the back daily

158
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,658
just because you tried
to get a job today,

159
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:35,962
which is something you're supposed
to be doing every single day.

160
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,363
You know... Yo, check this.

161
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:45,510
I tell you what. Yo, I'm not here
to be a burden on no one.

162
00:10:46,178 --> 00:10:49,773
Okay? So how about
I do my thing, you do your thing.

163
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,110
I'll move out, so that way you don't
have to stress out why I'm tripping.

164
00:10:55,221 --> 00:10:58,156
All right. I mean, if that's how you feel...

165
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,393
If that's what you wanna do,
I'm not gonna stop you.

166
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,258
Yeah, well...
I'll start packing this afternoon.

167
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:07,457
By the time you return from work,
I'll be handing over your keys to you.

168
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:09,033
That'll be it.

169
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,865
Okay. That's fine.
That's no problem. I gotta go.

170
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,601
So I guess
I'll just see you when I get back.

171
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:18,006
Whatever.

172
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,551
Yo, dawg. You want a cut?
I'm free. Come on.

173
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,723
Yeah. You're gonna stay free
if you're waiting for me, nigga.

174
00:11:30,723 --> 00:11:31,485
Yeah. You're gonna stay free
if you're waiting for me, nigga.

175
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:34,383
It's like that, Ty?

176
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,984
Oh, all right, all right. You know,
dude trying to eat,

177
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:39,087
trying to do the right thing,
and you want to play me.

178
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:41,325
Cool. Cool, because I'm on my grind, B.

179
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:43,368
I drop my CD this summer.

180
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,801
You know, I mean, the majors gonna be
throwing mad dough at the kid.

181
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,497
You gonna be the groupie nigga like,

182
00:11:47,606 --> 00:11:50,097
"Hey, yo, L, remember me
from the barbershop, son?

183
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:51,836
"What's up with them concert tickets?"

184
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,640
"Security! Fuck out of here, nigga."

185
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:58,776
Take it easy, man. Peace.
Don't be harassing my customers.

186
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,852
You can't help that man 'cause
he doesn't want his head bleeding.

187
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,181
Hey, yo, that was a condition, yo.

188
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:05,018
We had that conversation.
That was betwixt us.

189
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:07,217
Hey, man, how many heads
did you cut this month, L?

190
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,987
One and a half. You don't count the half

191
00:12:09,095 --> 00:12:11,290
'cause the dude
ain't have no neckbones.

192
00:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,498
Hell, you the only employed
unemployed motherfucker I know.

193
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:20,929
What up?

194
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,598
What up, man?

195
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:26,502
How many heads you got in front of me?

196
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:28,204
I got two, man.

197
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:34,716
Hold my spot. I'll be back.

198
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,621
I ain't know they let Rasheed out, dawg!

199
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,250
-Let him out two weeks ago.
-What?

200
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,692
You ever wonder why

201
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:47,493
they always let the grimiest negroes
out at summertime?

202
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,165
Summer recess.

203
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:51,531
Watch what I tell you. Duke will be out
before the summer ends.

204
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,629
But did y'all see how the nigga
was creeping in here, though?

205
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,265
Yo, Ra's the illest stickup kid
on the block, B.

206
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:59,276
Nel, you better watch your shop, man.

207
00:12:59,378 --> 00:13:02,108
That nigga right there, he gone.
He touched.

208
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:05,547
Hey, let me tell you something, fam,
I'm a grown-ass man,

209
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:09,417
and that right there is some straight ass
juvenile delinquent bullshit.

210
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,686
If you play AAA ball,
don't step into Yankee Stadium, right?

211
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,659
-That's what's up. That's gangster.
-You a OG for real, right?

212
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,128
Crazy, man.

213
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,534
Oh, Tone, what I told you about bringing
that raggedy-ass cart in my shop, man?

214
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,940
Oh, come on now, youngblood.
Fixing to hook you up.

215
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:34,444
Oh, shit.
Let me show you something. Come on.

216
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,345
I got some stuff here for everybody,
on sale.

217
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:39,974
On sale. Check this out.

218
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,722
This one here is a Hoover classic.

219
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,417
Your sweeping days is over, Rover.

220
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:50,325
This thing here can sweep up
every motherfucking thing in sight.

221
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:51,589
And I'm gonna let everybody,

222
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,927
anybody who wants it,
I'm gonna let you have it, today, for $50.

223
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,757
Get the fuck out of here.

224
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,460
Come on, man.
You know, I was just messing with you.

225
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,539
Give me $5, I'm gonna show you how...

226
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:03,404
Watch out!

227
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,137
-Fam, come on, man.
-Check this out.

228
00:14:09,815 --> 00:14:11,248
Oh, man.

229
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,751
-You're messing my floor...
-All right, I'm sorry.

230
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,880
Listen here, listen here, I'll go
and get it fixed and I'll be right back.

231
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,584
No, don't come right back.
Get the fuck out.

232
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,682
Just get out of here, man.

233
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:23,557
-Get it out! Get it out!
-All right, all right.

234
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:25,289
I'm out of here.

235
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:46,180
Oh, Ms. Germaine.
Hey, hey. How you doing?

236
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,014
Oh, CJ. How are you doing?

237
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,417
I'm doing good.
Let me help you with these bags.

238
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,081
Oh, no. Thank you, CJ.
I ain't want to trouble you.

239
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:53,590
Trust me. It's no trouble at all.

240
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,716
-Come on.
-All right.

241
00:15:04,203 --> 00:15:07,138
-Okay, Ms. Germaine.
-Oh, thank you so much.

242
00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:08,206
-God bless you.
-No problem.

243
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,502
By the way, Ms. Germaine,
you're looking real good.

244
00:15:14,446 --> 00:15:17,142
Y'all hanging out there today.

245
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:20,343
-It is hot. Hot as fish grease out there.
-Yo, C.

246
00:15:20,819 --> 00:15:22,150
What the fuck?

247
00:15:22,888 --> 00:15:25,448
What's up, mate.
Trying to sneak up on me and shit.

248
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,015
-How's it going? Yo, this jersey is fire.
-Chilling, man.

249
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,493
Come on, man.
You're wrinkling the shit.

250
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,257
-Shit dropped like two weeks ago.
-Yo.

251
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,298
Oh, word? Yo, you getting me one.

252
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,163
No doubt. I mean,
I was on my way to the store now,

253
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,293
until somebody wanna jump
on my back...

254
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,530
But it's nothing, you know...

255
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:41,105
What's up, CJ?

256
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,766
-What's up, Keish?
-How you doing?

257
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:47,004
I'm doing good. You looking real good.

258
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,807
That ain't even funny, yo.

259
00:15:48,914 --> 00:15:52,077
If you don't hit that by the time
you leave school, I'm gonna hit that.

260
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,015
-You ain't hit nothing, son.
-That's hating.

261
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,087
Yo, who she said hi to?

262
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,587
Exactly. Me.

263
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,158
-I'm still gonna hit it.
-You ain't getting nothing.

264
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:02,227
Don't deny me, man.

265
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:11,165
Baby, what's good?

266
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:16,136
Oh. What up? What up?

267
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,539
Oh, that LeBron is killer, man.

268
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,010
What up, my dawg? What's up?

269
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,706
What up, my dawg?
What up? What up, Ra?

270
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,751
What up?

271
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:28,285
Yo, what's up, man?

272
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:31,550
What's good, yo.
Who holding the rap game down, B?

273
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,421
Jay is holding the rap game down, baby!

274
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:36,653
-Chill out, yo. It's Nas.
-Nas?

275
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:41,222
-Nas holding the rap game down.
-Oh, yeah... Y'all niggas, man.

276
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:44,302
Yo, is he Dame Daddy
Dame Diddy or Dame Dummy?

277
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,530
Oh, I get it
You Biggie and he's Puffy

278
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:47,696
Exactly. You did...

279
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:50,434
So far ahead of your time
About to start another life

280
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:52,407
Look behind you
I'm about to pass you twice

281
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,378
-Come on, man.
-Get the fuck out of here.

282
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:56,448
Get them! Hit them!

283
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:58,607
-Why's your man in Tae Bo class?
-Hit him.

284
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:01,049
Why your man 40 years old
on top of that?

285
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,348
-Why he still in the rap game?
-You look like you're in Tae Bo!

286
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,389
-You take Tae Bo?
-Yo! Yo!

287
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:08,949
Yo, why is we talking about niggas?
Both of them niggas wack.

288
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,389
Yeah. I guess you're right, yo.

289
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:15,158
That nigga has been tight
falling off lately.

290
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:18,098
Yo, why the fuck we standing
over here, man,

291
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,034

292
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,538
bagging some birds?

293
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:25,034
Nigga, you is fucking right, man.
Yo, y'all coming, yo?

294
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:27,237
Nah, man. I gotta work soon.

295
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:31,510
Man. All right. You do that. You do that.
What about you, Esco?

296
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,209
Nah, I'm good.

297
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:37,350
All right, man. Yo. It's good, man.

298
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:43,727
-What?
-When did you start smoking?

299
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,797
-What?
-Nothing.

300
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:54,633
You know, we've been getting
a lot of complaints.

301
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,231
-Particularly with the Browser Buildings.
-I know. I know.

302
00:17:57,342 --> 00:17:58,832
To be honest with you, Sol,

303
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:01,242
you know, I don't think George
is doing such a good job maintaining...

304
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,247
That's exactly why we're here.
Pay our friend George a little visit,

305
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:06,647
do an inspection,
get some comments from the tenants.

306
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,719
Hear what they have to say.

307
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,082
If I don't like what I hear,
then he's gone.

308
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,622
He's been living in that apartment
for what, 32 years?

309
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:13,486
I fix it up, I could double the rent.

310
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,119
-It sounds like a plan to me.
-I'm glad you approve.

311
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:57,231
If you're still experiencing difficulties
sleeping, having panic attacks,

312
00:18:57,336 --> 00:19:00,464
or are depressed as the result
of the events surrounding 9/1 1,

313
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,698
please give us a call.

314
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,934
Our councilors are experienced
at dealing with trauma,

315
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:05,202
and we're here to help you.

316
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,575
If you really have a problem,
pick up the phone.

317
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,181
Are you crazy?

318
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,649
No, I'm serious.
Molly wanted you and me

319
00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:16,516
to go upstate,
and we'll take a look at the property.

320
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,647
All right. I'm serious.

321
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:21,354
You're crazy, girl.

322
00:19:42,714 --> 00:19:44,272
Can I help you?

323
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:46,781
Yes.

324
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,312
Yes, you can help me.

325
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,398
-Hey, girl.
-Hey now.

326
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,360
What's wrong?

327
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,902
-Talk.
-James and I had a fight this morning.

328
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:16,844
And it was pretty bad.

329
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,149
I think we're breaking up.

330
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:23,016
I'm sorry to hear that. What happened?

331
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:25,620
I was pissed off this morning,

332
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:29,421
because he didn't wake me up
and I was late for work.

333
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,361
So why didn't he
wake you up this morning?

334
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:35,262
Because he was gonna surprise me
with breakfast in bed.

335
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:39,394
That bum.
You need to drop him fast, girl.

336
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:42,064
Oh, D, it's not funny.

337
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,769
Your ass was probably up all night
writing, weren't you?

338
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:52,680
You seriously involved chicks kill me.

339
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,618
You've been out
of the single arena too long.

340
00:20:55,721 --> 00:20:57,951
-Oh, my God.
-Ain't nothing out here.

341
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,524
D, it's not about being single
or anything.

342
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,718
It has nothing to do with someone else.

343
00:21:01,827 --> 00:21:03,988
So then what's the problem?

344
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,227
We've been having financial problems,
like, this past year...

345
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,664
Let me tell you something, Claudine.

346
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,793
Jobs, finances...

347
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:14,432
They come and go.

348
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,033
But I've always admired you
and James' relationship.

349
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,781
And it would be a shame
to see it fall apart

350
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:29,343
on the account of things
you two have no control over.

351
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,015
You understand?

352
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,371
I'm sorry about that. I...

353
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,241
He's an idiot. I always tell him serve
the customers with the food first.

354
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,043
Oh, it's all right, Ali. I can wait.
It's no problem.

355
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:01,381
No, you deserve...
You demand that kind of attention.

356
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,786
You're a strong, decisive queen.
You know what you want.

357
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,950
Therefore if there is something
You can ask of me

358
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,324
Surely, I cannot front

359
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:12,556
-What?
-I wrote down more of it.

360
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,962
-I'll show it to you.
-Let me find out you rhyme, Ali.

361
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,592
That was cute. You got some skills.

362
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:20,497
I've been dabbling a little poetry
since your last show.

363
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,938
-Hey, when's your next one?
-Actually, it's tonight.

364
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:27,136
Well, I'm going to the Jazz Lounge
with Reggie,

365
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:28,542
celebrate his promotion.

366
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,548
So I'm gonna surprise him with a poem
and a song that I wrote for him.

367
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,845
You know, a little something.

368
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,347
That's nice.

369
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,099
You know you trying
to put it on a brother today.

370
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:53,838
I know you don't think you came up here
just to give me one round, right?

371
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,102
Come on, I don't...
Don't even come at me like that.

372
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,370
You know I'm a heavyweight.

373
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:02,137
-I hear you.
-You hear me, all right.

374
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:04,715
-Yeah.
-You gonna be hearing me in a minute.

375
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:09,915
Oh, good thinking.

376
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,019
It's hotter than a motherfucker out here.

377
00:23:22,701 --> 00:23:24,999
Damn, baby, where're you going?

378
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:26,968
I'll be right back.

379
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,562
I'm just going to the store right quick.

380
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,267
Get some Cheez Doodles or something.

381
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,706
-You want anything?
-No, I'm good.

382
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,581
-You got some change or something?
-Check my pockets.

383
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,320
You know I gotta be home at 6:30.

384
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:48,893
Yeah.

385
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:51,326
You might wanna be ready
when I get back, then.

386
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,761
All right.

387
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,868
Yo, so I'm gonna come through later,

388
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,436
tell you what I want you
to cop for me, all right?

389
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,836
Yo, come through. It's nothing.
What you about to get into right now?

390
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,840
-Nothing. Just chilling.
-No doubt.

391
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,341
Be safe out here, man.

392
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,638
-Stay out of trouble.
-All right.

393
00:24:06,745 --> 00:24:07,712
-For real, son.
-All right, yo.

394
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:11,248
-Hey, what's up, Mr. Chang?
-Hey, CJ.

395
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,976
Hey, we're a little busier than usual.

396
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:15,075
We can do inventory later. Can you
help Nancy with the customers?

397
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,415
Got you.

398
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,521
Hey, Nancy.

399
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,716
-Hey.
-How you doing?

400
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,293
Hey, what's up?
Can I help you with anything?

401
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:24,726
Yeah, man.
I'm trying to get size 12 in these.

402
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,390
Twelve? These are dope.
You're gonna... I like these.

403
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,466
All right, now.

404
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:55,251
-Sol?
-George.

405
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,828
This is a surprise.
I wasn't expecting you to...

406
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:01,797
-We have a meeting set for today?
-No. No. Would you mind?

407
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,663
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

408
00:25:03,768 --> 00:25:06,202
You weren't asleep or something
like that, were you?

409
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:09,398
Why would I be sleeping
in the middle of the afternoon?

410
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,100
Look, George,
I'm gonna be straight with you.

411
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,370
I've been starting to get some
complaints from the tenants

412
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:16,447
about your keeping up with
the maintenance of the buildings,

413
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,641
and I mean,
maybe you're getting a little old.

414
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,810
Something like that. If that's the case,
I'm gonna have to replace you.

415
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,617
And if I do that,
unfortunately, I'm also going to have to

416
00:25:25,724 --> 00:25:28,522
remove you from this apartment.

417
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,392
Now, look. If you want to get rid of me,
and you need a scapegoat,

418
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,022
well, then you just go right ahead.

419
00:25:35,133 --> 00:25:36,225
You're not fooling anybody.

420
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:38,393
I mean, you know these buildings
are run-down.

421
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,735
We're getting a little
ahead of ourselves here, okay?

422
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,330
That's why I came personally, George.

423
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,671
I'm here, personally,
so that you and I both

424
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,507
can go check on the conditions
of these apartments with the tenants.

425
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:49,978
We'll talk to them,
we'll make an assessment,

426
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:52,345
we'll come back down here,
we can just talk

427
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,715
reasonably about the whole matter.
Is that all right with you?

428
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,756
-As you wish. You're the boss, boss.
-All right, let's get started.

429
00:26:02,561 --> 00:26:04,791
-Y'all think Kobe did it, man?
-No. No.

430
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,227
There's no way my man
could have did that.

431
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,925
His wife way too fine
for him to be doing that shit, B.

432
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:12,094
You know what they say
about every fine woman out there.

433
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:14,569
There's a brother behind her
that's tired of hitting it.

434
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:15,901
Yes, sir.

435
00:26:16,007 --> 00:26:18,441
Nah, nah. I don't see Kobe
hitting nobody. I don't see it.

436
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:21,444
I know, but that's what a man get
for fucking with them white chicks.

437
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:24,845
Oh, here we go. Now the woman
in you want to come out.

438
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,384
How come every time
something like this go down,

439
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:29,851
the sisters wanna bring up
the white girl issue?

440
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:10,924
Nel, you ain't pay your bills, dawg?

441
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,765
Now what?

442
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,228
-What's wrong?
-My hair.

443
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:17,892
-Huh!
-Look at my hair!

444
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:20,198
Well, I'll tell you what.
Instead of $10, give me $5.

445
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,743
Mr. Landlord!
What happened to my electricity, sir?

446
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:31,441
Wait, could you calm down a minute?

447
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:33,073
-You got an electricity problem, right?
-Yeah!

448
00:27:33,184 --> 00:27:35,049
Happened when,
about five minutes ago?

449
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,848
Okay, well, it happened to
everybody at the same time.

450
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,447
We checked our circuit board.
It's not our fault. It's not our building.

451
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,186
We got to see... Maybe the whole
block's electricity has gone.

452
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:46,161
So we'll go next door, we'll check them
and see what's going on.

453
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,530
All right, okay. All right, okay.

454
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,397
I understand. I understand.

455
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:55,865
I didn't turn off...

456
00:27:58,276 --> 00:28:01,712
Police news and special report.
The Northeast...

457
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:07,046
...power outages, blackouts, if you will,
all along the Eastern seaboard,

458
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,313
specifically in the Northeastern U. S.

459
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,913
New York affected,
Detroit, Toronto, Ottawa,

460
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,726
as far west as Ohio.

461
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:15,192
as far west as Ohio.

462
00:28:15,593 --> 00:28:19,427
In New York City, JFK, LaGuardia,
Wall Street all experiencing

463
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:24,628
major outages. Just how widespread
these outages are is unclear at this time

464
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,727
and whether there's any connection
among any of them

465
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:29,068
is unclear at this time.

466
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:31,142
Well, I'm glad this
happened in the daytime.

467
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,609
Yo! Yo! Get some money over here!

468
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,210
What are you doing here?

469
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,021
Yo! Yo! Yo what the fuck is wrong
with y'all, man? Get out!

470
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,978
Yo, kid, you heard?
There's a blackout in the whole city!

471
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,943
Yeah, I know, we heard.

472
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:13,013
Where the hell 5-0 rushing off to?

473
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:16,178
I don't know,
but this shit right here is crazy.

474
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,452
No, no, no, stop!

475
00:29:24,896 --> 00:29:26,329
Stop! Stop!

476
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:27,862
Chill, son!

477
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:29,297
Yo, yo, son, I work here, son.

478
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,527
Yo, dawg, what you care?
You act like this shit belong to you!

479
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:33,763
This shit ain't right, son. It's not right.

480
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,635
Yo, Rasheed, what you doing?

481
00:29:37,742 --> 00:29:38,970
What the fuck is your beef?

482
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,476
Don't put your hands on me again,
nigga.

483
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:42,342
I ain't fucking with you, man.

484
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:56,322
Yo, just open the front gate halfway.
We'll sell through the opening.

485
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,834
Ain't no telling how long
this is going to last.

486
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:37,163
I got nothing. Can I borrow your phone?

487
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,099
No use. I don't have no reception either.

488
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:41,138
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

489
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,131
What if James got stuck in
one of those trains

490
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,802
in those tunnels
with the temperature so high.

491
00:30:46,911 --> 00:30:49,607
Wherever he is, I'm sure he's fine.

492
00:30:49,714 --> 00:30:51,841
I hope so.

493
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,577
How are you going to go
get Little J in Bed-Stuy?

494
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,652
By foot if I have to.

495
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:56,686
I'm gonna keep walking.

496
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,315
Hopefully, I can catch a cab or
a express van or something.

497
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,523
-I don't know.
-Hopefully.

498
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,194
You know, bin Laden
has something to do with this.

499
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:12,667
-You think so?
-Yes, man.

500
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,204
Where is he?
He should be here by now.

501
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,070
-Probably got stuck in traffic.
-You think I can get a cab at the corner?

502
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,143
-Let's do it.
-All right.

503
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,245
You know, when the going gets tough,
the tough get going.

504
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:25,407
"Searching for service."
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.

505
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:28,646
I don't even have one of those things.

506
00:31:28,753 --> 00:31:31,278
This is a low down dirty shame, people!

507
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,685
That even on doomsday,

508
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:40,986
you can't find it in your heart
to help a fellow man.

509
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,499
That's why it's about to get crazy.

510
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:48,395
This is nothing but a plot
by the government

511
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,974
to kill off all the black people.

512
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,064
The original man...

513
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:57,239
Hey, come on, taxi! Taxi, come on!

514
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:00,682
...until every last one
of you niggety-negroes...

515
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,819
MAN: Oh, shut up!

516
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,980
...is dead on the floor.

517
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:07,491
Like that.

518
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,958
Hey, taxi! Come on!

519
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,528
Maybe we better go back
to my apartment

520
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:19,227
until you can get a hold of your guy.

521
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:21,497
Port Authority says no trains
or subways are running...

522
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:22,573
What's up?

523
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:25,971
Yo, how the fuck you was going to
leave me like that back there, son?

524
00:32:26,077 --> 00:32:27,339
Shit, nigga, 5-0 was coming.

525
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,037
Why the fuck
you running from the police?

526
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,444
You see your mentality, dawg?

527
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,039
I don't know where
you come from, B, but around here,

528
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,679
you hear po-po coming, you dip.

529
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,085
You want to stand around
while they sweeping people up,

530
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:41,590
you go ahead.
'Cause any nigga will do...

531
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:44,753
Oh, I guess you don't have to worry
about that kind of stuff, huh?

532
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,626
-Mr. College Boy...
-Okay, dead that shit. All right? For real.

533
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,429
Don't run game on a nigga
who's known you all your fucking life.

534
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,503
I know you.

535
00:32:53,071 --> 00:32:55,096
Stop following behind those niggas, Ty.
For real.

536
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:58,733
You will end up in a real bad place
and I can't help you.

537
00:32:58,843 --> 00:33:00,606
-Yo, C.
-Yo, get off me, son.

538
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,538
All right, man?

539
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:05,878
What's up, B?
Watching all these cats wilding out.

540
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,679
Yeah, for real.

541
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:10,117
These cats out here, man,
they ain't wasting no time, B.

542
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:13,156
I can understand the looting, right?
'Cause it's a blackout.

543
00:33:13,257 --> 00:33:15,225
But damn,
can't they wait till the evening?

544
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,793
I'm saying, it's daylight outside.

545
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:18,862
I see you, nigga.
You know what I'm saying?

546
00:33:19,464 --> 00:33:20,431
Crazy.

547
00:33:21,532 --> 00:33:24,092
Hip-hop and R&B, 24/7 for the NYC.

548
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:25,896
I'm telling you, ain't this nothing?

549
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:29,599
Biggest blackout in American history
on the hottest day of the year.

550
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,174
What is it, like 98 degrees?

551
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,503
No air conditioning working.

552
00:33:33,611 --> 00:33:36,341
I hear people over at
Harlsborough Projects are assed out.

553
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,641
They're calling me up like, "Asia, girl,

554
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,616
"you know, we ain't got no water,
no air, no gas, no nothing. "

555
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,314
I'm telling you, devil's playing games.

556
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,548
Give me a call, though.
Let me know what your story is.

557
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:47,783
Where you at? What part of the city?
What's going on?

558
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:51,757
What you doing up north?

559
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,558
-That's right, that's right...
-Just chilling.

560
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,360
I'm saying. I feel you, man.

561
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,966
-I'm scared.
-What the fuck's up?

562
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,402
I could've stayed locked
the fuck up north, man.

563
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:05,465
This some old Gaza Strip-type shit.
Motherfuckers ain't got no water.

564
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:08,636
This ain't no Third World country, dawg.
I'm an American, man.

565
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,214
Why work hard when you can
stick a motherfucker for free?

566
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,340
Everybody got
a solid motherfucking hustle.

567
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,113
Know what I mean? Cops out here
just going in niggas' pockets.

568
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,017
Prez out there
sticking niggas up for their oil.

569
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,421
Let's walk over to the Holy Land.

570
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,789
I'll bet you all them camel cocksuckers
are open.

571
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,522
Cactus-drinking motherfuckers
keep water and food.

572
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,599
And you know Wisdom
got to keep his commissary full.

573
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,601
I smell something.

574
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:31,860
Somebody's barbecuing something.

575
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,298
We need some grills
or something out here.

576
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:34,701
Go down there and get some chicken.

577
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,040
No, I'm chilling.

578
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,835
-Hold this.
-Send her down there. She done.

579
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:46,310
-I'll be back. Okay?
-All right.

580
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,342
Didn't your mama tell
you to go into the house?

581
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:50,580
-No.
-Yes, she did.

582
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,053
-No, she didn't.
-I think she did.

583
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:53,623
-No, she didn't.
-Whatever.

584
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:12,910
Oh, shit.

585
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,883
Shit! DeeDee, man, wake up.

586
00:35:20,985 --> 00:35:23,749
Why the fuck you didn't
wake me up, man. What time is it?

587
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,551
Oh, shit, I gotta go.

588
00:35:56,888 --> 00:36:01,518
-Yo, CJ, how's your mother?
-Just chilling. She's fine.

589
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:03,457
Start heading inside,
it's going to get dark, all right?

590
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:06,553
-Yeah, I will. Have fun, enjoy it.
-All right.

591
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,806
Oh, my God.

592
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:26,246
-Babe, are you okay?
-Yeah... Hey...

593
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:28,682
-Listen, I'm sorry I'm late, you know...
-You sure?

594
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,253
Wait, how did you get home?

595
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:38,987
Hey, you made it home.

596
00:36:39,096 --> 00:36:41,087
Yeah. I trekked it all the way, too.

597
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,827
I was worried about you.

598
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:46,535
I was worried about you, too.
I tried calling you.

599
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:47,797
Ditto.

600
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,265
Oh, God.

601
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,710
Same way I always
get home baby, by train.

602
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:57,440
How's that possible?

603
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,108
What do you mean, "How's that
possible?" What are you talking about?

604
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,482
How'd you get home by train?

605
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,216
You know, I caught the train
like I always catch the train.

606
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,757
-Hey...
-Wait, Reggie,

607
00:37:07,858 --> 00:37:09,485
what was you,
on some kind of magical train?

608
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:11,528
I mean, was it running on
batteries or something?

609
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:15,326
The power's been out in
the whole city since this afternoon.

610
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,769
Baby, you know, I didn't have
a problem catching the train.

611
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:23,965
Maybe my train was...
Running on a special train.

612
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:27,644
Hey, we're running late
let's go get this thing going...

613
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,940
What are you doing, man?
What's going on?

614
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:36,218
Where were you, Reggie?

615
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,345
-What do you mean, where was I?
-Where were you, Reggie?

616
00:37:38,456 --> 00:37:40,390
-Where were you, Reggie?
-Hey, baby, you know I got to...

617
00:37:40,558 --> 00:37:44,085
What were you doing, Reggie?
What were you doing?

618
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,395
Yo...

619
00:37:45,997 --> 00:37:48,693
-Where were you, Reggie?
-I been at work.

620
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,363
You was at work?
You gonna lie to me now?

621
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:52,902
You gonna fucking lie to me now?

622
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:54,266
Get out!

623
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:56,602
-No stop it...
-No, get out!

624
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,698
Get the fuck out!

625
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:02,709
-Listen, baby...
-No, get your shit and get out.

626
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:04,212
Get the fuck out!

627
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:08,050
Well, I just wanted to make sure
you made it home safely, you know?

628
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,419
I should probably make my way out.

629
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,922
I didn't pack all my stuff,
so I have to come back later, okay?

630
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:19,825
I don't think it's such a wise idea to go
out there tonight. I mean, I don't...

631
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:24,562
I don't see what's the reason
why you can't stay one more night.

632
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:30,095
Another evening with me
isn't going to kill you, right?

633
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,277
Yeah, yeah, I guess you're right.

634
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,818
Hey, the fridge is still cool, you know.
None of the food is spoiled.

635
00:38:41,919 --> 00:38:43,887
That's good.

636
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,781
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah.

637
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,983
You're probably hungry.

638
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,453
Got some food on the stove.

639
00:38:51,462 --> 00:38:53,020
-I'll go get it.
-Okay.

640
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,097
Okay.

641
00:38:58,736 --> 00:39:02,399
Hi. This is Susie.
I'm calling from Chelsea.

642
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:05,304
And I just wanted to say
where I am right now,

643
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:07,840
things are really kind of beautiful,
you know.

644
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:10,173
We're all sort of hanging out together

645
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:12,272
and taking in
and helping each other, you know.

646
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,580
And there's a guy on the corner
with like...

647
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,713
And my neighbors have
a whole bunch of extra water

648
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,416
that they're carrying out to people.

649
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,085
And the kids are all playing
out on the street.

650
00:39:24,228 --> 00:39:26,128
It's kind of like a big street party,
you know.

651
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:30,030
And we're all just pulling together
and enjoying the time together.

652
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,329
It's a great time for us
to get to know each other, actually.

653
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:34,368
So, I know it's still so hard,

654
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:37,236
but we're having a good time
and pitching in...

655
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:40,601
I don't know, it's like the spirit of the city
is really coming through.

656
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:01,897
-What's up, man?
-Chilling. I'm good.

657
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,634
It's 8:30. Yankees game.

658
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,567
You got ESPN?

659
00:40:41,672 --> 00:40:44,106
I don't think we're gonna
have any television tonight.

660
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,667
You're right there, of course.

661
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,213
That's the reason
I'm stuck here to begin with. Idiot.

662
00:40:56,387 --> 00:41:00,050
-You're a baseball fan, huh?
-Oh, yeah. What are you, kidding?

663
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:01,181
My dad use to take me down here

664
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,159
to Ebbets Field all the time when I was
a kid to watch the Dodgers play.

665
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:07,389
I actually saw the great
Jackie Robinson play ball.

666
00:41:08,566 --> 00:41:10,500
Jackie was cool with me.

667
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:13,795
He was one class act.

668
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,340
You say that kind of like

669
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,637
you knew him personally.

670
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:25,043
I can go better than that.
We used to play on the same team.

671
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,005
You played ball with Jackie...

672
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,381
Okay, before I get very excited here,
let me ask you something.

673
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,679
Are you just some old guy
who maybe fabricates

674
00:41:31,789 --> 00:41:35,281
and exaggerates his life a little bit
to make up for his shortcomings?

675
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:41,156
You calling me a liar?

676
00:41:41,265 --> 00:41:42,926
I'll throw your ass out in the dark.

677
00:41:43,033 --> 00:41:48,300
No, no, I'm sorry.
Just checking. Sorry to interrupt.

678
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:53,933
When I was a young man,
I was quite an athlete.

679
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:57,913
After World War ll,
when I got discharged,

680
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,382
I was signed by the Negro League.

681
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:04,886
The Kansas City Monarchs, 1946.

682
00:42:05,956 --> 00:42:07,651
Had a great roster.

683
00:42:08,225 --> 00:42:10,125
Lot of talent on that team,

684
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:13,188
Jackie Robinson, Satchel Paige...

685
00:42:13,297 --> 00:42:14,264
Wow.

686
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:18,828
I got traded that season, though,
to the Newark Eagles.

687
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,403
The Eagles, right.

688
00:42:20,504 --> 00:42:26,136
You know, the Newark Eagles
and the Kansas City Monarchs

689
00:42:26,243 --> 00:42:29,076
played in
the Negro World Series that year.

690
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:32,974
Yeah. And the Newark Eagles won.

691
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:36,643
Sort of a revenge. Poetic justice.

692
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,882
I like to feel that
I had a little part in that.

693
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,359
Yeah.

694
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,695
I can't believe I'm sitting here

695
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:49,698
with a American Negro League
world champion.

696
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,561
George, that is...

697
00:42:51,669 --> 00:42:54,399
-So what position you play?
-Center field.

698
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,736
-You ever see Jackie Robinson again?
-Nope.

699
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:03,912
The next season
he got signed by the Majors.

700
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:08,075
And then after that, they
started picking off all the colored boys,

701
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:09,777
and so the Negro League just

702
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,184
sort of dismantled.

703
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,158
Yeah. I ended up in Brooklyn.

704
00:43:17,795 --> 00:43:19,057
That's where I met my missus.

705
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:21,893
Been here ever since.

706
00:43:28,205 --> 00:43:31,606
-Thank you for dinner.
-You're welcome, miss.

707
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,504
What happened to your face?

708
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,608
Some of the stores on
the block were looted today.

709
00:43:40,718 --> 00:43:42,709
Just got into a little scuffle,
but I'm all right.

710
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,651
-Are you sure?
-I'm good.

711
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:46,985
Nine months from now,
you know what it's gonna be.

712
00:43:47,191 --> 00:43:48,158
I'm good.

713
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:50,590
A lot of blackout babies!
So let's get it popping.

714
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:57,295
We have a lot to talk about, you and me.

715
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:00,267
-Okay?
-Okay.

716
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,106
I'm sorry...

717
00:44:04,875 --> 00:44:08,743
Yes, I was a bit frustrated
about our money situation.

718
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,282
However, all I kept thinking
about today was you.

719
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:17,153
I felt terrible for being
on your back this morning.

720
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:21,315
Today put a lot of things
in perspective for me.

721
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:23,552
About what's really important. I just...

722
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:27,757
I don't want to take
you for granted, okay? I'm sorry.

723
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:33,895
Look, I felt the same way, you know,
not being able to reach you and all.

724
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:36,598
But first off, I'm just glad you're okay.

725
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:39,909
Look, ma...

726
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:47,449
I got something important
I want to tell you and...

727
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,287
What is it?

728
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:54,884
I'm not doing good, you know?

729
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,752
I need some help.

730
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,825
You know, with the recession,
losing my job,

731
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:08,294
no work, you, me, everything...

732
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,538
You know,
at first I could deal with it, you know?

733
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:16,942
It was natural, I'd shake it off.
It was good, you know, it was all right.

734
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,984
But it's not easy no more, it's becoming
more and more difficult and...

735
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:25,751
I'm struggling, you know. I find myself...

736
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:28,723
I can't even walk out
that front door sometimes.

737
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:32,295
You know...

738
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,196
Then I realized, you know,

739
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:38,291
I was hurting... I was hurting
us both by keeping it from you.

740
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,502
You should have told me.

741
00:45:40,604 --> 00:45:43,004
We could have
gotten through this together.

742
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:45,341
It's...

743
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,537
I want to get some help.

744
00:45:48,645 --> 00:45:51,876
Okay, I'm going to get some help
to help me get back to being me.

745
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:54,416
Okay.

746
00:45:54,518 --> 00:45:57,487
Because I can't lose you.

747
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:59,954
No, you're not gonna lose me.

748
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:27,851
-Mind if I ask you a personal question?
-Of course. Shoot.

749
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:31,912
We're sitting here,
we're talking like two old buddies

750
00:46:32,022 --> 00:46:37,824
from talking about Jackie Robinson
to fusion to everything under the sun.

751
00:46:37,928 --> 00:46:39,759
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

752
00:46:42,499 --> 00:46:43,830
What happened?

753
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,065
What happened? Life happened.

754
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:49,571
I'll tell you what happened.

755
00:46:49,673 --> 00:46:54,633
There's the life you plan
and then there's the life you're given.

756
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,077
Don't feel sorry for me, bro, I'm cool.

757
00:47:01,118 --> 00:47:03,211
I've lived five lifetimes already.

758
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:08,585
You hungry?

759
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,887
Yeah, yeah, I could eat.
What you got on the menu?

760
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:13,220
Franks and beans.

761
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,930
-You got anything else?
-Yeah, beans and franks.

762
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:31,372
-I don't suppose those are firecrackers?
-No, I don't think it is.

763
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:33,943
I didn't think so.

764
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:48,364
Yo, Ty!

765
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,100
Ty, that's you?

766
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:56,164
Yo, Ty, what you doing outside, man?

767
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:09,108
Oh, my Lord.

768
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,082
-What are they doing out there?
-What else?

769
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:17,752
Taking advantage of the situation.

770
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:21,294
Come on, baby, close the curtain, okay?

771
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:25,893
Come on.

772
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:33,142
Hey, George.

773
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:37,141
Did you ever seen that movie
The Ten Commandments

774
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,407
with Charlton Heston?

775
00:48:38,515 --> 00:48:40,415
Of course.

776
00:48:40,517 --> 00:48:42,644
Do you remember that scene
he's talking to all the Israelites,

777
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,744
and he's telling them,

778
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:50,053
"Stay in your homes and wait for
pestilence and the Angel of Death

779
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,924
"to go into the homes of the Egyptians"?

780
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:56,360
That's how I feel

781
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,499
right now, like we're
waiting for darkness to pass.

782
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,036
Feel like praying?

783
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,237
Just kidding.

784
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:24,291
Hey, would you like to
stay the night out here?

785
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:28,630
Yeah, maybe that's a good idea.
I mean for both of us, right?

786
00:49:28,899 --> 00:49:29,866
Right.

787
00:49:31,335 --> 00:49:32,302
Yeah, okay.

788
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,015
Good night, George.

789
00:49:47,551 --> 00:49:49,542
Good night, Sol.

790
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:00,996
Yo, Ty, you out here?

791
00:50:01,865 --> 00:50:03,162
Yo, yo, yo!

792
00:50:07,137 --> 00:50:08,434
It's dark as hell out.

793
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,642
Yo, Tyrone, stop playing, son,
where you at?

794
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,982
Yo, word to my mother, son.
Don't make me hurt you, son.

795
00:50:23,954 --> 00:50:25,319
Yo, Ra, chill, son.

796
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:28,482
Oh, you see me, man. You think
I give a fuck if you see my face, cousin?

797
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,951
Yo, Ra, chill, son.

798
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,085
-Take your shit off.
-Yo, chill.

799
00:50:33,663 --> 00:50:35,187
Yo chill, what?

800
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:38,557
Bro, you ain't gotta do this, man.

801
00:50:38,668 --> 00:50:39,862
-Word.
-Yeah, word.

802
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:42,461
-No, you know me, son...
-Word.

803
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:44,403
I'm from your block.

804
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,567
-I'm from your block, son.
-Don't fuck with me.

805
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:49,509
-Yo, we from the same block, yo.
-That don't mean shit, partner.

806
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:51,877
-Little fucking fancy nigga, boy.
-Yo, Ra.

807
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:54,239
You gonna beg me, right?

808
00:50:54,584 --> 00:50:55,744
Yo, chill, son.

809
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,342
Fuck you doing?

810
00:51:12,736 --> 00:51:13,998
You's a dumb motherfucker, you know?

811
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:15,696
That's why I've never
liked your fucking ass!

812
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:22,611
All you had to fucking do
was run a jersey, nigger.

813
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,677
And now you want
to act all fucking hard and shit.

814
00:51:44,734 --> 00:51:46,258
CJ?

815
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,226
CJ?

816
00:52:14,397 --> 00:52:15,887
Where are you?

817
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:25,475
Okay.

818
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:43,726
CJ!

819
00:52:45,562 --> 00:52:46,529
CJ.

820
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,161
CJ, where are you?

821
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:53,634
-Ma'am! I just want some water!
-No! No!

822
00:52:53,803 --> 00:52:57,068
-Come on! I just want some water!
-No!

823
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,139
Stop flashing it at my face.
Do something, man.

824
00:53:04,247 --> 00:53:05,544
Go get some clothes or something.

825
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:06,980
Yo, son, let me tell you something, man.

826
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,812
We about to fucking rack up today, man.

827
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:12,787
Yo, let's not get greedy, son.
We good. Let's bounce.

828
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:15,619
Nigga, is you fucking crazy?
Understand what I'm trying to tell you.

829
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:17,283
Right now, tonight,

830
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:21,990
New York is deaf, dumb,
blind and she about to get fucked.

831
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:23,998
Let me tell you something, B.

832
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,295
When is the next time you think
we gonna get a shot like this?

833
00:53:26,403 --> 00:53:29,429
You think there is gonna be another
blackout like this again? You stupid?

834
00:53:29,573 --> 00:53:31,541
Yo! Go upstairs

835
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:33,270
and get some sneakers, man!

836
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,435
Bring them shits downstairs.
Now, hurry up, man!

837
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,376
Make sure you get some Filas, homie.

838
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,611
-Come on, hurry the fuck up.
-Come on, let's go, let's go!

839
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:44,016
Yo!
Tyrone, what the fuck you doing, man?

840
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,323
Damn, I'm going to prison!

841
00:53:57,667 --> 00:53:59,191
Get them lights off.

842
00:54:06,509 --> 00:54:07,703
All right, motherfuckers, where are you?

843
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:08,903
Get your hands up!

844
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,675
Don't shoot! Please don't shoot!
I don't have any weapons on me, sir.

845
00:54:12,816 --> 00:54:15,944
Move front! Move front!
Put your fucking hands up!

846
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,051
Put your hands up! Get up, get up,
get up! Get your hands up!

847
00:54:19,155 --> 00:54:21,885
Spread your fucking legs!
Spread your legs and don't move!

848
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:24,256
Is anybody else in here?

849
00:54:35,372 --> 00:54:36,999
Nah, son.

850
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,845
You don't got to be like this.

851
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,545
Oh, God!

852
00:55:01,731 --> 00:55:03,426
I got too much to do.

853
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,912
Not like this. You got plans for me, God.

854
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,248
Mom said you got plans for me.

855
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:25,951
Mom said you got...

856
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:29,455
Mom said you got plans for me.

857
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,866
-James, wake up!
-Baby, what?

858
00:56:12,802 --> 00:56:15,930
-Do you smell that?
-What, baby?

859
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,001
Smells like there's a fire
on the other side of the building, baby.

860
00:56:19,109 --> 00:56:22,306
Baby, come on. Come to bed, all right?
We've been up all night.

861
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:26,079
There's nothing we can do about it.
Come on, just come to bed.

862
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:10,587
No.

863
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,395
No.

864
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:25,165
No.

865
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,668
No.

866
00:57:31,915 --> 00:57:33,041
No, please.

867
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,082
Ma'am, it's the police. You all right?

868
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,429
Okay. Everybody needs to go back

869
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:56,638
to their buildings
and make sure their neighbors

870
00:57:56,739 --> 00:57:58,468
and everybody is all right.

871
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,635
Please! Everybody go check if your
family and your neighbors are okay.

872
00:58:03,179 --> 00:58:04,908
You two, come with me.

873
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,152
Is everybody all right in there?

874
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:22,758
Is everybody all right in there?

875
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:29,899
You all right?

876
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,400
Is everybody all right in there?

877
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,375
I'm stopping by
to see if everybody is okay!

878
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:47,755
Ms. Germaine! It's...

879
00:58:49,959 --> 00:58:51,324
Ms. Germaine?

880
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,594
It's Fatima.

881
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:58,225
I'm just stopping by
to see if everybody is okay!

882
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,435
Ms. Germaine? Are you in here?

883
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,114
Ms. Germaine!

884
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,351
Ms. Germaine! Ms. Germaine!
Oh, my God!

885
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:19,544
Ms. Germaine!

886
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:21,184
Ms. Germaine! Are you okay?

887
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,025
Help! Ms. Germaine... Help!
I need help in here!

888
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,793
-What's up?
-They got CJ, dawg.

889
00:59:50,086 --> 00:59:51,110
Wait.

890
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:55,446
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

891
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,342
Shit!

892
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,219
What happened?

893
01:00:27,991 --> 01:00:30,653
-They stabbed CJ last night.
-What?

894
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:34,591
-ls he okay?
-Nah. He died, yo.

895
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,801
-Oh, God! I just saw him yesterday!
-Oh, shit!

896
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,672
I told him... I told him to go back inside
because it was going to get dangerous.

897
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,939
This is bullshit, son.

898
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:49,810
My God.

899
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,907
Man, son didn't even deserve
to go out like that, man!

900
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,517
He was going to school.
He was doing his thing.

901
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:58,446
Shit is fucked up, yo.

902
01:00:58,554 --> 01:01:00,351
I bet you this was somebody from
outside the neighborhood.

903
01:01:00,456 --> 01:01:01,445
Ain't nobody that we know did this.

904
01:01:01,557 --> 01:01:03,184
Why would somebody want to hurt him?

905
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,123
I don't fucking understand this!

906
01:01:05,428 --> 01:01:07,225
This doesn't make any sense!

907
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:09,991
Damn, son, lights go out
one motherfucking time,

908
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:11,259
niggas don't know how to act.

909
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:13,858
-One time!
-What the fuck are you all doing!

910
01:01:13,970 --> 01:01:16,666
Why! Please tell me why
y'all are killing your fucking own!

911
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:19,640
He was going to make something out
of his life! He represented you!

912
01:01:19,976 --> 01:01:22,672
He was one of our finest products
and you shattered everything!

913
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,650
I need backup right now!

914
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:33,789
Why don't you go find out
who killed my man?

915
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:35,721
Stop harassing us!
Why don't you do your job, man?

916
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:41,625
Hitting the street isn't going
to do us any good, Claudine,

917
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:43,392
but make us hot and more pissed!

918
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:47,494
-Okay...
-Baby.

919
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,902
Look, why don't you just lie down
and take a nap.

920
01:01:51,007 --> 01:01:52,702
And I'm sure, by the time you wake up,

921
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:54,743
the power will be back on
and everything will be all right.

922
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,269
What if it's not?

923
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,645
You know?
What if it doesn't come back on?

924
01:02:00,750 --> 01:02:03,344
Like, what the fuck
are we going to do, James?

925
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,952
How are we gonna eat?

926
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:08,421
There's no food in that fridge that's
gonna be good one more night.

927
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:10,790
This doesn't make any sense.

928
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,028
-Baby, where are you going?
-I'm going to go lay down.

929
01:02:29,712 --> 01:02:32,977
Ms. Germaine! Ms. Germaine!

930
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,674
-Ms. Germaine! You all right?
-You all right?

931
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:36,342
-You all right?
-Ms. Germaine, you all right?

932
01:02:36,452 --> 01:02:37,419
God, have mercy!

933
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:40,415
About time y'all got here.
I called y'all damn near 40 minutes ago!

934
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,654
What, y'all guys forgot
about us down here in the hood?

935
01:02:43,793 --> 01:02:47,092
I'm going with her. I want to go with her.

936
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:53,101
Hey, yo,
what happened to Ms. Germaine?

937
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:56,132
She went the whole night without any
food or any insulin for her diabetes

938
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,139
-and passed out.
-What?

939
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,906
-She going to be all right?
-Yes, she's going to be all right, brother.

940
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,477
She's going to be just fine.
You know what I am saying?

941
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:04,842
Ain't nothing new under the sun.
They've done this to us before.

942
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,040
It all comes back around 360 degrees,
you know what I'm saying.

943
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,015
Now it's our turn
for our generation to sustain!

944
01:03:09,285 --> 01:03:10,411
-Yo, Tech.
-Yes?

945
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:11,851
I need you to get the word out
in the neighborhood.

946
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:12,943
Sorry, Fa.

947
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,249
-No.
-Listen, I'm not the one for this.

948
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,053
I need people to know they got to take
pictures of all the food that went bad

949
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,184
in their home last night.

950
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,558
-The City is liable, yo!
-Fa, I'm out.

951
01:03:21,397 --> 01:03:24,264
That shit is politics as usual.
That's what the fuck it is, man!

952
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,925
-That's some bullshit!
-You just figuring that out?

953
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:27,832
There ain't no money down here,
nobody got no money,

954
01:03:27,937 --> 01:03:28,961
nobody making no money,

955
01:03:29,071 --> 01:03:31,301
so why the fuck they gonna rush
down here to turn the lights back on?

956
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:33,102
-So it's about money?
-What the fuck do you think it is?

957
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:35,473
Could be some corporate tricks,
you know.

958
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,977
I wouldn't put nothing past them
Enron motherfuckers.

959
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,014
Wait, don't N-Ron live down the street?

960
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:42,240
-Cam, come on.
-Quit looking at me like that.

961
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,581
There's a dude named N-Ron
who lives up the block.

962
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:48,756
-He don't spell it the same.
-You're embarrassing me right now.

963
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:50,859
Come on, Rick,
take a walk with me, man.

964
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:52,688
I'm rolling with y'all.

965
01:04:00,636 --> 01:04:03,264
Yo, this shit is
survival of the fittest, dawg.

966
01:04:03,372 --> 01:04:04,771
-That's what I'm saying.
-It's crazy out here.

967
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:06,836
Keep going like they're going
down in Washington,

968
01:04:06,943 --> 01:04:10,071
-this shit'll be like this every day.
-Shit looks like a war zone.

969
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:11,806
Hey, yo, man, word up.

970
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:13,677
I'm gonna go get some water
or something, man.

971
01:04:13,783 --> 01:04:15,910
It's hotter than Tahiti
out in this motherfucker.

972
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,446
Damn!

973
01:04:23,192 --> 01:04:26,389
Word up, I don't know about y'all,
but I'm starting to get real vexed.

974
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:28,224
They better turn this motherfucker on,

975
01:04:28,331 --> 01:04:31,960
so I can have some access to my
fucking money. I'm hungry as hell, yo!

976
01:04:32,068 --> 01:04:34,093
This shit ain't even funny no more, man.

977
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,568
It never was.

978
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,842
-Any updates?
-Nope.

979
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:48,015
Just the same old broken promises.

980
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:54,280
You're having cereal with that milk?
What if it's spoiled, James?

981
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,584
It tastes fine to me.

982
01:04:55,691 --> 01:04:57,716
It's a little warm,
but it's all right, I guess.

983
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:28,356
Nel, man,
I'm saying we need to hop in your whip

984
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:30,084
and get out this neighborhood
or something.

985
01:05:30,192 --> 01:05:32,183
-Hell, no. You haven't been listening?
-Listening to what?

986
01:05:32,695 --> 01:05:35,163
-All the gas stations closed.
-What?

987
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:38,199
Yeah. Let this shit last for two,
three more days

988
01:05:38,301 --> 01:05:40,030
and all these cats you see out here
flossing on the strip

989
01:05:40,136 --> 01:05:41,626
is gonna be assed out.

990
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:46,839
This some old Mad Max Beyond
Thunderdome in Brooklyn-style bullshit.

991
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,678
-I'm preserving my gas, man.
-It's not going to get that crazy, Nel.

992
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:52,145
We'll see.

993
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,004
Yeah, okay.

994
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,879
How old is this fool,
trying to call us out like this?

995
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:33,647
He ain't talking about nothing.

996
01:06:36,792 --> 01:06:38,817
See, that's why I don't stay
on no corner, man.

997
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,930
They give me the wrong juice.
Let me come inside.

998
01:06:44,033 --> 01:06:46,058
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I can't do that.

999
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:07,483
-All right.
-Let's do it. We do what we got to do.

1000
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,528
Hey, yo, what's up?

1001
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:16,996
Hey, yo, relax. Relax with that shit.
Calm the fuck down.

1002
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,557
Relax with the shit, man,
I got it under control, baby. Relax.

1003
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,467
Yo, yo, what's up? What's up, man?
What's up?

1004
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,008
A salami and bacon, Osama.

1005
01:07:26,108 --> 01:07:28,338
What's the deal, man?
You still selling water by the gallons?

1006
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:29,536
-No.
-No?

1007
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:31,044
-Only small ones, a dollar.
-Small ones?

1008
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:32,671
But you gonna have to wait
like everybody else.

1009
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,477
-No, I ain't waiting, dawg, man.
-I understand.

1010
01:07:34,583 --> 01:07:37,143
I don't take orders
from motherfucking sand niggers,

1011
01:07:37,253 --> 01:07:38,686
you know what I mean?

1012
01:07:38,821 --> 01:07:42,052
You play that shit in the Middle East,
this is Brooklyn, New York, baby.

1013
01:07:42,158 --> 01:07:43,352
Next.

1014
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:46,354
No, on the real, son,
you gotta chill the fuck out, son.

1015
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:49,226
I'm too hot for this bullshit.
You've been bugging since yesterday.

1016
01:07:49,331 --> 01:07:52,323
You gotta max that shit out, bro.
For real.

1017
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:58,706
Now's the time to make yours, man.

1018
01:08:02,511 --> 01:08:06,072
That's the same Harlsborough cat
that drove by the store earlier, man.

1019
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:10,383
CJ don't have me feeling
all this stuff out here right now.

1020
01:08:11,821 --> 01:08:13,516
Bullshit. Word is bond...

1021
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:16,182
Damn, dawg, why in the fuck are you
drilling me like that man?

1022
01:08:16,292 --> 01:08:17,384
Excuse me?

1023
01:08:18,861 --> 01:08:20,158
Hey, yo, what's up, man?

1024
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,954
You looking at me
like you know me or something, man.

1025
01:08:23,566 --> 01:08:25,534
Niggas don't know me over here, man.
What's up, yo?

1026
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,499
There's no stores
over on Harlsborough?

1027
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,503
Last time I checked,
there were stores over on Harlsborough.

1028
01:08:30,873 --> 01:08:33,103
Can't hear what you're saying, man.
Come here, yo.

1029
01:08:33,776 --> 01:08:34,868
No, no. Chill.

1030
01:08:37,246 --> 01:08:39,441
Yeah, that's what up, man. What's up?

1031
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:45,954
Y'all should do your motherfucking job
find them niggas that killed my man.

1032
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,579
-What's good with that?
-We don't want no problem.

1033
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:48,679
If I was you, I'd keep my voice down.

1034
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,486
If you was me? This is my block!

1035
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,720
What's the problem man?
You know me or something?

1036
01:08:53,896 --> 01:08:56,160
-Yeah, I know you.
-What's up, nigga?

1037
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,960
You know me?

1038
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,395
What's going on, man,
what you gonna do?

1039
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:04,372
I'm gonna take that fucking gun!

1040
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:52,686
We got power, baby!
We got power! We got power!

1041
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,266
Hey, yo, Ali, man...

1042
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:17,172
What y'all need?

1043
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:26,383
-Hey, Fatima.
-Hey, Ali.

1044
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,414
It's crazy out there, huh?

1045
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:34,561
I guess your surprise evening
was ruined last night.

1046
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,462
In more ways than you can imagine.

1047
01:10:38,934 --> 01:10:41,402
I am sure you can
make it up some other time.

1048
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:46,398
I'm afraid yesterday's blackout
shed light in my apartment last night.

1049
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:48,943
Reggie and I are no longer together.

1050
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:54,043
Say word? I mean, for real?

1051
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,677
-I'm sorry to hear about that.
-Really?

1052
01:10:58,454 --> 01:10:59,648
I'm not.

1053
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,693
Take care, Ali.

1054
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:08,529
Fatima, wait.

1055
01:11:08,897 --> 01:11:10,364
Listen.

1056
01:11:13,702 --> 01:11:16,466
Maybe you and I can catch some
spoken word sometime.

1057
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:20,167
You know, have dinner, get to know
each other outside of this element.

1058
01:11:23,178 --> 01:11:24,645
You asking me out?

1059
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:27,841
Yeah.

1060
01:11:28,017 --> 01:11:31,248
I mean, I was respecting your boy,
but if he did something stupid

1061
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,947
to lose a beautiful gem like yourself...

1062
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:39,956
I can't just sit back and let you get lost
Or swept up in some deep sands

1063
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,724
Like a pestilence coming across
the lands you've been looking for

1064
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:45,197
Okay, that's enough poetry.

1065
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,796
Wow, I never...

1066
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:55,371
I never thought about you like that,
and it's a...

1067
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,978
-It's not you, you know what I'm saying?
-No, I understand.

1068
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:02,607
We're cool and everything,
but I just never...

1069
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:06,349
So I'll see you around.

1070
01:12:07,589 --> 01:12:08,988
Hey, I hope you feel better.

1071
01:12:18,734 --> 01:12:19,894
Okay.

1072
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:25,329
Okay?

1073
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:51,992
Call me.

1074
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,770
I'll do that.

1075
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:01,234
Bye, Ali.

1076
01:13:11,353 --> 01:13:12,411
Yeah!

1077
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:17,186
Thank you, Allah. Thank you.

1078
01:13:20,629 --> 01:13:22,460
-He better be here.
-Yeah.

1079
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,591
Where... Oh, yeah.

1080
01:13:26,702 --> 01:13:28,135
You're a day late!

1081
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:32,367
Well, George, I think this is it.
Thank you for everything.

1082
01:13:33,075 --> 01:13:35,737
Hey, you're welcome. You know,
it's not every day I get company.

1083
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:39,976
You know, I've been thinking I'm gonna
have to get these places renovated.

1084
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:43,415
I mean, I have to keep them updated
just to keep the need for

1085
01:13:43,519 --> 01:13:45,043
all these repairs down.
What do you think?

1086
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,088
The tenants will be happy to hear that.

1087
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:49,623
They better be happy. I don't want them
pestering my superintendent.

1088
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,989
Your hands are gonna
be full with these renovations, right?

1089
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:53,955
That's true. That's true.

1090
01:13:57,933 --> 01:13:59,867
George.

1091
01:14:02,371 --> 01:14:05,135
Listen, you call me, all right?
Keep me personally updated

1092
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,571
with everything, any time, any place.

1093
01:14:06,675 --> 01:14:09,007
You call me directly.
Any problems, all right?

1094
01:14:09,845 --> 01:14:13,076
-I'll do that, sir, thanks.
-Take care of yourself.

1095
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:14,509
You, too.

1096
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:22,512
Hey, boss, you all right?
How did you make out last night?

1097
01:14:24,593 --> 01:14:25,821
I'm fine.

1098
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,721
I'm just great,
everything turned out great.

1099
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:30,331
I'm really sorry about that, you know.

1100
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:31,997
I mean, leaving you out here.

1101
01:14:32,434 --> 01:14:34,595
You know, with all the power out,
I had no way of reaching you,

1102
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,762
and then I thought it might be
dangerous if I returned.

1103
01:14:36,872 --> 01:14:39,966
You know, maybe you might have
taken a cab or something.

1104
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,943
You thought I might have
taken a cab or something?

1105
01:14:44,112 --> 01:14:47,946
How the hell do you think I could have
gotten a cab here last night?

1106
01:14:48,350 --> 01:14:51,547
By holding my wallet up in the air?
Flashing my ass?

1107
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,454
You know what? Never mind.
Everything, Anthony, is just fine.

1108
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,652
-Don't worry about it, okay?
-Okay.

1109
01:14:59,728 --> 01:15:04,756
Okay, so how did it work out
with George? Did you kick him out?

1110
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:07,398
No, actually, I didn't kick him out.

1111
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,027
I learned a great deal about George

1112
01:15:09,137 --> 01:15:10,195
during the course of our evening
last night,

1113
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,830
and I found out, in fact,
that he is an asset to me,

1114
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,499
so he's staying.

1115
01:15:14,610 --> 01:15:18,410
I am, however, contemplating firing you
for deserting my ass here last night.

1116
01:15:19,381 --> 01:15:20,746
Are we going to start
some time this century?

1117
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,546
Or are you gonna plan to stay in this
neighborhood for the rest of my life?

1118
01:15:32,394 --> 01:15:33,759
Hey, George.

1119
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:37,389
-Hey, youngblood, how you been?
-Good, I'm good. Better now, I guess.

1120
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:42,067
Now is it me, or does it suddenly feel
just a little bit cooler now?

1121
01:15:43,438 --> 01:15:45,599
I think it's you.

1122
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:51,145
Little man, come here, man.

1123
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:55,744
Hold up. When you gonna fix
this dude's head up, man?

1124
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,076
I got you. I got you.

1125
01:15:58,186 --> 01:15:59,881
Go ahead, man.
I'm just playing with you.

1126
01:15:59,988 --> 01:16:01,785
That shit is good!
He make you look good!

1127
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:05,483
You jacked him up,
but you ain't mean to.

1128
01:16:05,594 --> 01:16:07,892
Power has officially
been restored in NYC.

1129
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,997
With the exception of a few minor,
sporadic incidents,

1130
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:15,593
reports indicate that there have been
very few cases of looting, some fires,

1131
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:18,199
mostly as a result of burning candles.

1132
01:16:18,807 --> 01:16:21,503
There's been few, if any,
violent cases of attacks.

1133
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:24,745
New Yorkers, if anything,
were helpful, supportive

1134
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,404
and were on their best behavior,

1135
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,507
proving that the will and the power of
the people of this city

1136
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:32,312
cannot and will not be broken.

1137
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,482
I'm going to the corner store.

1138
01:16:35,290 --> 01:16:36,257
Get some milk.

1139
01:17:03,852 --> 01:17:05,513
Oh, God!

1140
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,654
My people! My people!

1141
01:17:13,161 --> 01:17:16,528
Having fun. The lights are back on.

1142
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:19,732
You can go back to having fun now.

1143
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:25,038
You just missed

1144
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:28,367
a goddamn-near opportunity of your life!

1145
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:31,711
You spent time in the dark.

1146
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:37,309
Dark's a very special place, you know.

1147
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,045
You can see things.

1148
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:46,520
You can see things that you don't see
out here with all the distracting bullshit.

1149
01:17:49,598 --> 01:17:51,930
You see that true light.

1150
01:17:57,572 --> 01:18:00,973
Stevie Wonder. Ray Charles.
Helen Keller.

1151
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:04,011
They all saw
something special in the dark.

1152
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:05,903
They got smart in the dark.

1153
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:08,139
What did you do? Little humpty-hump?

1154
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,841
Or steal something?

1155
01:18:12,054 --> 01:18:14,614
Now the lights are back on,
business as usual.

1156
01:18:15,757 --> 01:18:18,317
Black out, black in,
black in, black out, black out.

1157
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:23,531
You should find you a dark spot.

1158
01:18:23,965 --> 01:18:25,626
We can learn something.

1159
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,735
Oh, God!

1160
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,536
We need a messiah.

1161
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:38,008
Somebody that can come and say
to all the CJs in the world,

1162
01:18:38,814 --> 01:18:41,840
"Lazarus, rise up and walk. "

1163
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,952
And wipe away all the tears

1164
01:18:49,658 --> 01:18:51,785
from a million mothers' faces.

1165
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,554
Out here, business as usual.

1166
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:27,384
Everybody having a good time.

1167
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:31,288
Just another day in the ghetto.

1168
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:38,463
Just another day in Brooklyn.

1169
01:20:08,464 --> 01:20:10,964
