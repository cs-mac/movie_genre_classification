1
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:56,600
I have to get home to Africa.

2
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:04,700
I am stuck in purgatory at my
mother's house in New Jersey.

3
00:01:06,513 --> 00:01:09,812
This trip has been a total bust.

4
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:14,012
I am the world expert
on Bayaka Pygmy music,

5
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,713
and I haven't sold a single CD.

6
00:01:15,822 --> 00:01:21,385
Larry, if I can hear it, its too loud.

7
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:24,555
Too loud. Too loud.

8
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:27,633
This music is Beethoven to me, ma!

9
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:22,507
Sataka, it's time to call the White.

10
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:27,453
Ow!

11
00:03:41,334 --> 00:03:42,995
WOO!

12
00:03:52,178 --> 00:03:54,271
Chainsaws? A ringing sound?

13
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:55,871
Its more like a whine.

14
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:56,971
That frying?

15
00:03:57,083 --> 00:03:59,813
Frying and then a chopping sound,
like an axe on a tree.

16
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,512
Chk! Chk!

17
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:04,315
Tinnitus indeed. Get dressed.

18
00:04:07,294 --> 00:04:08,921
Doc says my liver is shot.

19
00:04:09,029 --> 00:04:11,293
I don't get a new one I'll die.

20
00:04:12,098 --> 00:04:16,592
With luck we'll,
we'll have one in a month.

21
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:20,035
You'll have good days and bad days.

22
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,973
I never have good luck in New York.

23
00:04:23,076 --> 00:04:26,341
Leprosy is entirely curable.

24
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:28,646
Don't worry about the ear.

25
00:04:28,748 --> 00:04:30,079
Nothing for it anyway.

26
00:04:30,183 --> 00:04:32,208
It's my instrument.

27
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,651
They use to call me Big Ear in Africa.

28
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,312
They won't be calling you
anything anymore,

29
00:04:36,423 --> 00:04:38,721
Larry your Africa Days are over.

30
00:04:38,825 --> 00:04:40,349
For how long?

31
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,189
Forever.

32
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,563
Mergh.

33
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,899
Mergh.

34
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:55,341
What if I stayed in America?

35
00:04:55,442 --> 00:04:57,603
I'll never complete my catalog.

36
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,945
Only one instrument left to get.

37
00:05:01,348 --> 00:05:02,906
Molimo.

38
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,951
Holy Grail of Pygmy music.

39
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:17,390
I gotta see Lydia.

40
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:31,000
That's how the Bayaka describe
the sound like a horn,

41
00:05:31,111 --> 00:05:33,636
like uh a bull roar.

42
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:35,737
So interesting.

43
00:05:37,217 --> 00:05:40,846
Lydia, my liver is shot.

44
00:05:40,954 --> 00:05:43,149
I've got one more trip left in me,

45
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,281
I need the Malimo.

46
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,023
And it's not expensive.

47
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,195
Africa, Africa.

48
00:05:52,098 --> 00:05:53,895
You don't have cash?

49
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:57,561
Ow.

50
00:05:58,338 --> 00:05:59,464
Thank you.

51
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,142
Sataka.

52
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:00,823
Well you have to include the Dogon,

53
00:07:00,934 --> 00:07:02,561
The Dogon? -Yes.

54
00:07:02,669 --> 00:07:05,035
You, you really want to include them?

55
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:07,067
They're not endangered peoples.

56
00:07:07,173 --> 00:07:09,835
The Dogon are not endangered?

57
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:12,571
How many of them can there possibly be?

58
00:07:12,679 --> 00:07:14,943
At least five hundred thousand.

59
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,440
Merci.

60
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,458
Oh, merci.

61
00:08:26,686 --> 00:08:28,244
You guys tourists?

62
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:31,882
Certainly not, we despise tourists.

63
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,652
We are travelers.

64
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,125
Here, have some tea.

65
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:38,425
Yes our goal is to visit all the
endangered people of the world

66
00:08:38,531 --> 00:08:39,589
before they disappear.

67
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,564
We just came from Papa New Guinea.

68
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:43,465
Bloody amazing.

69
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:47,131
The Kirala tribe, they use the skulls
of their ancestors as pillows.

70
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:49,197
Where are you from?

71
00:08:49,309 --> 00:08:50,537
Yamondo.

72
00:08:50,643 --> 00:08:51,974
Central Africa.

73
00:08:52,078 --> 00:08:53,841
Yamondo, yeah.

74
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:01,846
Formerly a small trading village,

75
00:09:01,955 --> 00:09:06,324
forest pygmies,
to date considerably compromised.

76
00:09:06,426 --> 00:09:07,723
yeah.

77
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,590
Are you Peace Corp?

78
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,467
What?

79
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:17,866
Not Peace Corp. -What?

80
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:20,997
It's a perfectly reasonable,
leave me alone.

81
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,374
He's really pissed off now.

82
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:23,703
Shut up.

83
00:09:30,116 --> 00:09:33,813
Our honored Chinese guest has arrived,
Kirikiri.

84
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,444
It's a big day.

85
00:09:43,429 --> 00:09:44,657
Off you go.

86
00:09:59,712 --> 00:10:02,146
I don't mean to contradict your
guide book but uh-

87
00:10:02,248 --> 00:10:05,149
but if there's one place on Earth
that will never ever change,

88
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,275
its Yamondo

89
00:10:06,386 --> 00:10:07,444
I'm sorry?

90
00:10:07,553 --> 00:10:09,111
You see the Byaka are different.

91
00:10:09,222 --> 00:10:11,315
They spend of their time living
in the forest,

92
00:10:11,424 --> 00:10:13,824
and in the forest people
leave them alone.

93
00:10:13,927 --> 00:10:15,724
And if they have been compromised,

94
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:20,424
it is because of their Bantu neighbors
who treat them like slaves.

95
00:10:36,883 --> 00:10:40,182
The bus! The Bus!

96
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,883
The Bus!

97
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,174
No room for pygmies.

98
00:11:04,143 --> 00:11:07,169
Don't you recognize me?

99
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,269
Chief!

100
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:09,848
I'm your chief, Simboki.

101
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,974
Stop! It's my chief!

102
00:11:12,085 --> 00:11:13,177
My chief!

103
00:11:13,286 --> 00:11:14,810
My White man!

104
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:16,718
My Chief!

105
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:17,653
They know his name.

106
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:19,088
They know him.

107
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:28,491
Greetings!

108
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:39,676
What are you all doing here?

109
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,076
We came to meet you!

110
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,045
How did you know I was coming?

111
00:11:43,149 --> 00:11:45,913
Sataka called ''Big Ear'' and he came!

112
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,714
Yes, Sataka called me.

113
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,912
Now they've got cell phones?

114
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:50,683
Total non-starter.

115
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:34,927
You're still here! Out.

116
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:41,338
Get out of here!

117
00:12:41,574 --> 00:12:44,805
Kirikiri, take a left here.

118
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:01,657
Oh oh! The Mayor's car.

119
00:13:10,303 --> 00:13:11,565
Greetings.

120
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,661
Oh my god.

121
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,508
Our sawmill!

122
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,372
Thanks to the sawmill we have noise now!

123
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:25,944
It's huge.

124
00:14:26,045 --> 00:14:28,741
It looks like it could
swallow the whole forest.

125
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:33,282
Does it ever sleep?

126
00:14:33,386 --> 00:14:35,013
Never!

127
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:09,103
Simboki, Bobanjo.

128
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:12,077
Ah, Merci.

129
00:16:25,131 --> 00:16:27,031
Ah, monsieur Larry.

130
00:16:27,133 --> 00:16:29,192
The white with the ear phones.

131
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,202
I thought it was you.

132
00:16:34,874 --> 00:16:36,501
Its me, Bassoun.

133
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,605
The mayor.

134
00:16:40,212 --> 00:16:42,043
How fortunate you are back.

135
00:16:42,148 --> 00:16:44,480
Mr Yi, meet mister Larry.

136
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,608
An expert on our country.

137
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:51,315
I told Mr. Yi you are a very very good
friend of our little brothers

138
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:52,857
of the great equatorial forest,

139
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:55,256
almost a pygmy yourself.

140
00:16:55,928 --> 00:16:57,793
Are you peace corp?

141
00:16:57,897 --> 00:16:58,329
Well-

142
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,093
Is looking for kind of a pygmy horn.

143
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,497
Called the Malimo.

144
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:05,968
Made of ivory and uh yanis.

145
00:17:06,372 --> 00:17:08,670
Most people say it doesn't even exist.

146
00:17:08,774 --> 00:17:09,968
It exists.

147
00:17:10,076 --> 00:17:11,634
A myth.

148
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:18,116
I hope you haven't forgotten a
little souvenir for me from America.

149
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:23,414
Is that my friend Bobanjo?

150
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:25,820
Yes, it's the musician of Yamondo.

151
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:28,086
Bobanjo? Come over here!

152
00:17:28,194 --> 00:17:29,388
Ga!

153
00:17:42,408 --> 00:17:44,035
Come close...

154
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:53,109
I want to do a little business.

155
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:57,416
I want Sataka to kill two elephants
for me.

156
00:17:57,523 --> 00:17:59,582
With big tusks!

157
00:18:00,426 --> 00:18:02,553
Sataka lives in the forest now.

158
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:04,151
He is like a leopard.

159
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:08,700
He doesn't hunt elephants anymore.

160
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:14,831
Find him! He's the best hunter.

161
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,204
Stop the car!

162
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,418
What was that about?

163
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:32,184
Oh I asked them to put on a pygmy
dance to welcome you to Africa.

164
00:18:45,805 --> 00:18:48,273
Larry! Larry! Larry!

165
00:18:49,175 --> 00:18:50,403
Larry!

166
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:59,476
Start up the pipe

167
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,979
There's been a lot of rain.

168
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:06,848
Give me the smoke, it is my turn.

169
00:20:09,922 --> 00:20:11,583
Look at that!

170
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:15,621
Hey, what's for breakfast?

171
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,025
Nothing!

172
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:24,567
How's it going?

173
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,103
Fine.

174
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:28,666
Where's Sataka?

175
00:20:28,774 --> 00:20:30,742
Note here! In the forest.

176
00:20:30,843 --> 00:20:31,537
In the forest?

177
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,111
Far.

178
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:37,445
Pipe?

179
00:20:37,816 --> 00:20:39,943
So uh when do we leave for the forest?

180
00:20:41,987 --> 00:20:43,818
Never.

181
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:45,356
We don't go into the forest anymore.

182
00:20:45,457 --> 00:20:47,322
What do you mean,
''We don't go to the forest anymore.''?

183
00:20:47,426 --> 00:20:49,087
We are too busy.

184
00:20:49,194 --> 00:20:51,128
We don't go into the forest.

185
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,629
We stay in the village.

186
00:20:52,731 --> 00:20:54,756
The Mayor has forbidden it.

187
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:58,598
He wants us to stay in the village.

188
00:20:58,704 --> 00:20:59,693
The Mayor?

189
00:20:59,805 --> 00:21:03,263
It's bad, very bad.

190
00:21:14,086 --> 00:21:22,926
There are to many Bantu in the
forest with guns.

191
00:21:23,028 --> 00:21:30,127
They shoot and kill everything.

192
00:21:39,345 --> 00:21:41,711
Give me matches.

193
00:21:41,814 --> 00:21:43,111
Ah no.

194
00:21:43,716 --> 00:21:45,411
Give me matches!

195
00:22:21,887 --> 00:22:25,550
We want some of that cloth.

196
00:22:29,895 --> 00:22:32,125
I don't have any cloth.

197
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,926
I don't have any cloth.

198
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,254
You bring things for the men.

199
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,792
what about us women?

200
00:23:07,499 --> 00:23:12,596
I don't want this, change it.

201
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:19,244
Ask him.

202
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:21,369
Okay, where's mine?

203
00:23:30,889 --> 00:23:31,719
Who is she?

204
00:23:31,824 --> 00:23:34,850
Sataka's granddaughter.

205
00:23:34,993 --> 00:23:37,826
Wow. She's grown up.

206
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:50,565
Welcome.

207
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,314
Give it to me.

208
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:08,757
I'll carry it.

209
00:24:09,428 --> 00:24:10,725
Let's go!

210
00:24:15,968 --> 00:24:17,936
Don't run.

211
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,113
OD.

212
00:24:40,526 --> 00:24:42,653
Sony. Begin.

213
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:06,344
Bad news.

214
00:26:06,445 --> 00:26:08,413
Your request has been denied.

215
00:26:09,514 --> 00:26:10,538
I am truly sorry.

216
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:13,243
It's a long way to come for such news,
but...

217
00:26:13,352 --> 00:26:15,047
how many other areas to cut

218
00:26:15,153 --> 00:26:17,713
that do not involve the hunting grounds
of our little brothers?

219
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,154
I don't want the other areas.

220
00:26:19,258 --> 00:26:20,247
I want here.

221
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:23,226
I would be glad to assist you
with an appeal Mr. Yi.

222
00:26:23,328 --> 00:26:24,625
How long will that take?

223
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,426
The problem is the wildlife club.

224
00:26:27,532 --> 00:26:30,399
They've been protecting elephant there
for thirty years.

225
00:26:30,502 --> 00:26:33,596
We are poor country,
we depend on their resources.

226
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:38,768
Recently they've even given the pygmies
their own traditional hunting areas.

227
00:26:42,781 --> 00:26:44,612
There is hope I think Mr. Yi.

228
00:26:44,716 --> 00:26:47,480
The pygmy love elephant meat
as much as I do,

229
00:26:47,586 --> 00:26:52,956
and if I can prove to the wildlife club
that they are a threat to the elephant,

230
00:26:53,058 --> 00:26:55,959
then perhaps I can explain it to
all our associates

231
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:58,791
that your saw mill offers
a more stable partnership.

232
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:02,298
So you know a pygmy who will
kill an elephant for us.

233
00:27:04,569 --> 00:27:07,629
And the American who lives
with the pygmies, wont he interfere?

234
00:27:07,739 --> 00:27:09,001
You mean Larry?

235
00:27:09,441 --> 00:27:11,966
Larry's not long for this world, Mr. Yi.

236
00:27:12,077 --> 00:27:14,011
Have you looked at him closely?

237
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:15,739
His color, the skin?

238
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:21,012
As they say, our ''African climate
is entirely unsuitable for Caucasians''.

239
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,014
Take it as a down payment.

240
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,625
Bonjour.

241
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:37,393
Bonjour.

242
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:39,832
Mulala!

243
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:41,735
It's you, Mulala?

244
00:27:42,607 --> 00:27:44,541
You cheated me.

245
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,873
I paid you three cigarettes

246
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:49,880
and you never showed up to work
in my fields.

247
00:27:50,916 --> 00:27:53,180
First of all,

248
00:27:53,285 --> 00:27:58,518
I'm going to take my pineapple.

249
00:27:59,691 --> 00:28:03,787
Give me the radio.

250
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,266
Ho!

251
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:17,507
We don't need Bantus here.

252
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:23,443
Bantus here.

253
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:53,808
Larry! Larry!

254
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:58,015
We should put on a dance.

255
00:28:58,116 --> 00:29:00,607
Oh! Boca! Abone, uh?

256
00:29:00,719 --> 00:29:02,846
If we put on a dance,
the Molimo will come.

257
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:05,479
Never! It never comes in the village.

258
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,888
We just need money for beer.

259
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:15,666
What's that?

260
00:29:25,744 --> 00:29:27,939
The bicycle you ordered.

261
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,344
No way.

262
00:29:30,449 --> 00:29:32,076
Guys, I just got here,

263
00:29:32,184 --> 00:29:34,084
I did not order a bicycle.

264
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,749
These are my transport.

265
00:29:37,956 --> 00:29:40,652
I won't need a bike when I go
/into the forest.

266
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:44,695
An important man like you has
to have wheels.

267
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,388
No, I don't have any money.

268
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:47,760
But, you're a white man.

269
00:29:47,866 --> 00:29:49,356
You'll have it paid off in no time.

270
00:29:49,468 --> 00:29:50,662
Only a hundred thousand francs.

271
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,669
A hundred thousand? That's outrageous.

272
00:29:52,771 --> 00:29:58,971
Really, a white man like you
only has a little money?

273
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:00,806
Drop it.

274
00:30:01,546 --> 00:30:03,013
Larry.

275
00:30:03,381 --> 00:30:05,781
Larry? The bike is nice,

276
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:08,944
and you can give me a ride on it.

277
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,493
Oh god I can't afford this.

278
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,560
Okay.

279
00:31:17,923 --> 00:31:20,050
There you are!

280
00:31:21,426 --> 00:31:24,293
Ah, monsier Lamer.

281
00:31:33,471 --> 00:31:35,268
Your prolonged stay in America.

282
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:36,499
It went well?

283
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:37,506
Not bad.

284
00:31:37,609 --> 00:31:40,476
You must have brought back
some wonderful things.

285
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:46,550
Well, communication from the
president himself.

286
00:31:57,162 --> 00:32:00,359
To go into t he forest now,
one needs 'laissez-passer'.

287
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:02,194
I've never needed--
New rules!

288
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,767
Sure but I-

289
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:06,336
One never refuses the President.

290
00:32:06,438 --> 00:32:09,305
Mister Larry,
a lot has changed since you left.

291
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:12,774
We are in the process of 'systematizing'
our pygmies.

292
00:32:12,877 --> 00:32:16,313
No more beef hearts or swinging
in trees.

293
00:32:16,414 --> 00:32:18,974
We are a modern country.

294
00:32:21,353 --> 00:32:22,718
Monsiuer Lamer!

295
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:24,118
Ha!

296
00:32:25,123 --> 00:32:27,921
Not even a tiny little watch for me?

297
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,719
One never refuses the Mayor!

298
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,194
Kirikiri!

299
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:33,924
Come, we're leaving.

300
00:33:46,037 --> 00:33:49,438
Larry, why are you still in the village?

301
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:53,910
Sataka is waiting for you in the forest.

302
00:33:54,012 --> 00:33:55,502
Is that true?

303
00:33:56,147 --> 00:33:57,671
Sataka will come for me.

304
00:34:01,486 --> 00:34:03,351
So, are you going tomorrow?

305
00:34:03,455 --> 00:34:06,891
You're staying in the village.

306
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:09,186
Why?

307
00:34:09,294 --> 00:34:11,194
If only you could hunt.

308
00:34:11,296 --> 00:34:13,161
I know how to hunt.

309
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:14,754
You, hunt?

310
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,166
Larry! Larry!

311
00:34:19,604 --> 00:34:22,596
The farmer is hiring. Let's go!

312
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:26,336
You carry my basket, and I'll hunt.

313
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:29,479
Larry!

314
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,812
Nice bike, fuck head!

315
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:10,085
I must have people to work...

316
00:35:10,188 --> 00:35:16,787
you, you and you too...

317
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:23,994
Get over here and follow me.

318
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:01,864
We can expand our operations,
to the Congo but these concessions

319
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:04,999
would test our mastery of the most
forbidding frontier.

320
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:07,202
Most valuable timber in Africa.

321
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:08,836
And the hardest to get.

322
00:36:10,448 --> 00:36:12,279
You like a challenge.

323
00:36:17,622 --> 00:36:19,681
Ah! I prefer elephant meat.

324
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:22,149
Elephant is my favorite.

325
00:36:23,261 --> 00:36:24,489
Please.

326
00:36:28,099 --> 00:36:29,225
Why not?

327
00:36:29,334 --> 00:36:30,961
It was already dead.

328
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:41,039
I wonder why the French never
penetrated your forest.

329
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:43,807
Maybe they were afraid of the darkness.

330
00:36:43,915 --> 00:36:45,746
Not the dragon that is said to be here?

331
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,182
Who told you about the Mokiliimbimi?

332
00:36:51,256 --> 00:36:54,191
Our little brothers of the forest
have a lot of imagination

333
00:36:54,292 --> 00:36:56,658
but uh...
these machines you Chinese have,

334
00:36:56,761 --> 00:37:00,356
so great, so powerful,
they go over everything. Right?

335
00:37:00,932 --> 00:37:02,297
Don't they?

336
00:37:06,571 --> 00:37:08,198
Don't they?

337
00:37:53,384 --> 00:37:54,942
Sataka.

338
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,454
Are you coming in?

339
00:37:58,556 --> 00:37:59,887
I'm coming.

340
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:06,187
I don't think the White's coming
on his own.

341
00:38:06,297 --> 00:38:07,787
I'll go get him.

342
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:21,304
Larry. Come and get your food.

343
00:38:24,816 --> 00:38:26,249
Food.

344
00:38:28,853 --> 00:38:30,218
Merci.

345
00:38:35,226 --> 00:38:36,386
Larry!

346
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:42,726
Larry! I brought Mr. Yi-

347
00:38:42,834 --> 00:38:46,770
he wants to
buy a CD of your pygmy music.

348
00:38:51,643 --> 00:38:53,133
Dollars or Euros?

349
00:38:53,244 --> 00:38:57,237
Oh, um, I only wish I had one to sell,
uh I'm all out.

350
00:39:00,018 --> 00:39:02,919
But uh, but I'm surprised that uh
you have an interest.

351
00:39:03,021 --> 00:39:04,818
I am interested in everything.

352
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:06,446
Do you want a grub?

353
00:39:06,724 --> 00:39:07,452
They're good.

354
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:08,820
No thank you.

355
00:39:10,828 --> 00:39:15,492
But what I find strange is our workers
are terrified to go into the deep forest

356
00:39:17,969 --> 00:39:20,995
Uh, the Bantu are uh
extremely superstitious.

357
00:39:21,105 --> 00:39:22,003
Even the Mayor.

358
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,870
They speak of this uh... monster.

359
00:39:24,976 --> 00:39:27,672
That only the Bayaka can speak to.

360
00:39:27,779 --> 00:39:28,939
Mokili-imbimbi.

361
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:32,138
There you go.

362
00:39:36,954 --> 00:39:38,353
What are they saying?

363
00:39:39,557 --> 00:39:44,256
Uh, they're saying uh that uh
has big scales like a crocodile.

364
00:39:44,362 --> 00:39:47,661
It sleeps on a bed of elephant tusks

365
00:39:47,765 --> 00:39:50,598
and a horn out of it's fore head.

366
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:52,260
That its feet are on backwards...

367
00:39:58,309 --> 00:40:00,368
Smoking too much of that pipe!

368
00:40:03,848 --> 00:40:07,477
You scared the foreigner away.

369
00:40:23,601 --> 00:40:25,228
Kirikiri?

370
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:31,463
Go serve this summons on Mr. Whitman.

371
00:40:31,576 --> 00:40:33,043
It's urgent.

372
00:41:41,746 --> 00:41:44,146
Ah, welcome Mr. Larry.

373
00:41:44,248 --> 00:41:45,545
Please.

374
00:41:51,322 --> 00:41:52,516
Thank you for coming.

375
00:41:52,623 --> 00:41:53,681
Ca va?

376
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:55,486
Do you have everything you need?

377
00:41:55,593 --> 00:41:57,185
Not exactly.

378
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:59,522
If our little brothers give you
any problem,

379
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:00,824
don't hesitate to tell me.

380
00:42:00,932 --> 00:42:02,490
I will have my men straighten them out.

381
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,932
No, ca va, ca va bien.

382
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:06,128
Good.

383
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:09,005
Now, for the matter at hand, uh...

384
00:42:09,106 --> 00:42:13,008
you have to register your recording
equipment with my office.

385
00:42:13,911 --> 00:42:16,436
Do you have a permit to make recordings?

386
00:42:18,783 --> 00:42:21,650
I have never needed one.

387
00:42:21,752 --> 00:42:25,210
I told you, this is a modern country.

388
00:42:25,323 --> 00:42:28,554
We have regulations
now regarding our patrimony.

389
00:42:28,659 --> 00:42:31,526
You cannot go recording our
birds and animals for free.

390
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:33,221
I am adding to the patrimony,

391
00:42:33,331 --> 00:42:36,596
the complete recordings of the
Babajella Forest Instruments.

392
00:42:36,701 --> 00:42:38,828
I know all about your project Mr. Larry,

393
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:39,766
but without a permit-

394
00:42:39,871 --> 00:42:42,339
I have never heard about a permit!

395
00:42:43,307 --> 00:42:45,104
Are you deaf? -No.

396
00:42:45,209 --> 00:42:48,508
You understand what I said?
New regulations!

397
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:52,140
You must bring your equipment
here immediately

398
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:54,047
and leave it with me for safe-keeping.

399
00:42:54,151 --> 00:42:57,382
What is it with you people and your
obsession with pieces of paper!

400
00:42:57,488 --> 00:43:00,821
With your stupid official stamps on it!

401
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:02,820
Who created the little papers.

402
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:05,293
It's my people? Or your people?

403
00:43:19,143 --> 00:43:22,044
And now, for the last time

404
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:25,274
you must bring your equipment
here immediately.

405
00:43:25,383 --> 00:43:27,146
Mr. Larry, don't worry,

406
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:30,414
I will personally ensure
that it is returned to you.

407
00:44:03,254 --> 00:44:06,621
What a beautiful man!

408
00:44:07,058 --> 00:44:09,288
He has a woman in every village.

409
00:44:14,832 --> 00:44:17,460
The Bantu tease me.

410
00:44:18,302 --> 00:44:21,169
They say the white will leave again,

411
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:22,637
but I'll still be here.

412
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:25,766
I only just arrived.

413
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:30,904
I've work to do in the forest.

414
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:06,381
To make good dance,
we need more palm wine.

415
00:45:06,484 --> 00:45:10,113
No. No money.

416
00:45:35,479 --> 00:45:37,743
Wait. Wait.

417
00:45:37,848 --> 00:45:39,509
I have a Molimo!

418
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:42,776
Give me money,

419
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:44,479
and the Molimo will come, really!

420
00:45:44,588 --> 00:45:46,556
I have no money.

421
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:48,557
Bobanjo says, ''leave the white alone''.

422
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:50,627
The Molimo is here!

423
00:46:45,349 --> 00:46:48,512
Obanjo! Obanjo!

424
00:46:51,288 --> 00:46:54,155
Obanjo! Obanjo!

425
00:47:04,902 --> 00:47:06,369
Obanjo!

426
00:47:32,963 --> 00:47:34,453
Sataka.

427
00:47:54,485 --> 00:47:58,683
I hear you stay in the forest
all the time now.

428
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:01,417
I am staying in the forest forever.

429
00:48:01,525 --> 00:48:06,189
I eat honey...I eat yams...

430
00:48:06,297 --> 00:48:10,631
tap root...near a big clearing.

431
00:48:10,734 --> 00:48:15,137
There's too much noise in the village,
lots of noise.

432
00:48:15,239 --> 00:48:16,604
The village is bad.

433
00:48:16,707 --> 00:48:20,837
The village is very, very bad.

434
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:22,643
I stay where...

435
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:30,547
-at Bounging Bai.

436
00:48:30,654 --> 00:48:32,019
It's good.

437
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:34,056
I brought a gift for you.

438
00:48:34,825 --> 00:48:36,986
I have a gift for you.

439
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,267
Ma ya na ka do o fay.

440
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:54,841
Sataka!

441
00:50:34,178 --> 00:50:35,304
Ow.

442
00:51:22,059 --> 00:51:24,960
Larry went to America.

443
00:51:25,062 --> 00:51:26,495
Never. He took his machete.

444
00:51:26,597 --> 00:51:27,325
Larry's like a baby in the forest.

445
00:51:27,431 --> 00:51:29,126
Someone should go with him.

446
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:49,612
Argh!

447
00:52:54,885 --> 00:52:57,353
Listen to me.

448
00:52:57,454 --> 00:52:59,115
Listen to me, I am the chief.

449
00:52:59,223 --> 00:53:02,681
Larry has gone into the forest.

450
00:53:02,793 --> 00:53:05,227
...To find Ekadi and Sataka.

451
00:53:05,329 --> 00:53:05,988
We should follow.

452
00:53:06,096 --> 00:53:08,690
What about the Mayor?

453
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:16,632
We'll ask the Jengi.

454
00:54:38,989 --> 00:54:41,617
I wanna find Sataka!

455
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:50,356
Where's Ekadi?

456
00:56:01,905 --> 00:56:03,463
The white man got lost.

457
00:56:03,573 --> 00:56:06,098
He was bending stems like crazy.

458
00:56:06,209 --> 00:56:08,177
He got lost in the forest.

459
00:56:08,278 --> 00:56:09,404
Where did he lose his way?

460
00:56:09,513 --> 00:56:13,540
Careful.
The forest can spin your eyes.

461
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:14,639
I, I know.

462
00:56:14,751 --> 00:56:15,979
My eyes were spinning.

463
00:56:16,086 --> 00:56:18,020
Let's go.

464
00:57:43,673 --> 00:57:45,140
Mushrooms.

465
00:57:47,844 --> 00:57:48,970
Sataka.

466
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:53,015
Look at the mushrooms the white
has picked!

467
00:57:57,254 --> 00:57:59,245
He's going to kill us all.

468
00:58:00,957 --> 00:58:03,255
Hey, I didn't know.

469
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:33,647
The oracle doesn't bullshit.

470
00:59:33,750 --> 00:59:36,150
We'll soon find out where Sataka went.

471
00:59:37,220 --> 00:59:38,812
Did they go to the Likumbe?

472
00:59:40,056 --> 00:59:42,422
Did they go to the Ndoki?

473
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:44,750
Did they go to the Makupe?

474
00:59:45,762 --> 00:59:46,786
Did they go to Cameroon?

475
00:59:46,897 --> 00:59:51,493
Of course they did not go to Cameroon.

476
00:59:51,601 --> 00:59:53,501
Relax- I'm just warming up the oracle.

477
00:59:53,603 --> 00:59:55,503
Enough of the oracle.

478
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:57,835
I know the way to the camp.

479
01:00:02,646 --> 01:00:08,676
Makombe is like that with men.

480
01:00:08,785 --> 01:00:10,719
I'm useless.

481
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:14,187
I can't even dance.

482
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:18,156
That's true.

483
01:00:19,296 --> 01:00:24,359
No doubt about it, you can't dance.

484
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:26,401
I can't hunt either.

485
01:00:26,503 --> 01:00:27,834
Hunt?

486
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:32,068
I will teach you to hunt.

487
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:57,395
Elephant.

488
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:04,299
Commander, surround this house!

489
01:02:07,837 --> 01:02:09,065
Mr. Larry?

490
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:12,903
Your behavior has jeopardized an
important affair of state.

491
01:02:13,576 --> 01:02:16,306
I'm issuing orders for your arrest.

492
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:21,182
Search in there.

493
01:02:28,591 --> 01:02:30,286
Search the whole place.

494
01:02:38,835 --> 01:02:41,736
Larry has left this list behind.

495
01:02:45,742 --> 01:02:47,573
This list is useless,

496
01:02:47,911 --> 01:02:52,143
They can't be farhinding in the bush-
round them up!

497
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:21,169
There's a big cobra in those weeds!

498
01:03:23,847 --> 01:03:28,113
I'm going to get you!

499
01:04:11,361 --> 01:04:15,491
So Sataka used me as bait to get
the whole village into the forest.

500
01:04:27,677 --> 01:04:30,111
It's like the Jersey shore in summer.

501
01:05:53,730 --> 01:05:57,359
Get over there,
you don't know how to build a house.

502
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:14,509
...this isn't necessary.

503
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,976
I know that certain people have been
telling you...

504
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:18,911
it's lies!

505
01:07:19,015 --> 01:07:23,543
If we catch them they'll be punished.

506
01:07:24,787 --> 01:07:26,254
Stop this nonsense.

507
01:07:26,356 --> 01:07:27,789
Come out of there.

508
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:29,289
That's an order.

509
01:07:34,931 --> 01:07:37,058
I know what you're thinking.

510
01:07:38,368 --> 01:07:41,360
You think you can hide in there forever?

511
01:07:41,771 --> 01:07:43,136
Well no!

512
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:48,777
I'm going to call the army
and they'll come with machine gun

513
01:07:48,878 --> 01:07:52,712
and orders to get you out of there
dead or alive.

514
01:07:52,815 --> 01:07:57,445
This is a federal offensethe kind of
crime that can cost you your lives!

515
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:01,852
Zero.

516
01:08:01,958 --> 01:08:03,687
Search everywhere.

517
01:08:03,793 --> 01:08:06,159
In the branches. Under the trees.

518
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:15,728
Listen, if you don't come out right now,

519
01:08:15,838 --> 01:08:18,398
you'd be better off never coming out!

520
01:08:18,508 --> 01:08:21,671
Okay! Stay in the bush forever!

521
01:08:21,778 --> 01:08:23,609
Stupid pygmies!

522
01:08:23,713 --> 01:08:26,079
You think I won't find you?

523
01:08:26,549 --> 01:08:29,017
Even if you go all the way
to the Congo...

524
01:08:29,118 --> 01:08:31,518
You'll come back here one day and...

525
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:34,419
I'll still be the Mayor... for life!

526
01:10:45,555 --> 01:10:49,548
Larry? He's useless! He's lazy!

527
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,320
I like Larry.
He's funny and he is kind.

528
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:54,760
He dances like this.

529
01:10:54,864 --> 01:10:57,628
But I really like him!

530
01:11:43,546 --> 01:11:45,844
I don't dance.

531
01:14:12,194 --> 01:14:12,717
Hey

532
01:14:12,828 --> 01:14:16,320
My mother sent me over here.

533
01:14:16,432 --> 01:14:17,922
I've brought you a yam.

534
01:14:18,033 --> 01:14:19,261
Merci.

535
01:14:19,568 --> 01:14:20,796
It's a nice yam.

536
01:14:20,903 --> 01:14:22,165
Nice mat!

537
01:14:26,242 --> 01:14:30,702
It's cold, lie on it with me.

538
01:14:30,813 --> 01:14:33,043
My mother's waiting...

539
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:02,275
Larry!

540
01:17:33,862 --> 01:17:36,456
Larry! Larry!

541
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:38,692
Larry! Larry...

542
01:17:43,839 --> 01:17:46,069
Larry! Larry...

543
01:17:56,652 --> 01:18:00,748
Larry!
Your ''wife'' has made you a hut.

544
01:18:00,856 --> 01:18:03,620
She can cook up your portion
of the snake.

545
01:18:04,626 --> 01:18:08,255
My ''husband'' will have to do
more for me than sit on a snake...

546
01:18:08,364 --> 01:18:10,594
At least fin me some honey.

547
01:18:14,703 --> 01:18:18,434
He's afraid of bees.

548
01:21:12,181 --> 01:21:14,649
All work and no play.

549
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:17,479
Let's go.

550
01:21:18,153 --> 01:21:18,881
Let's go.

551
01:21:18,987 --> 01:21:21,820
Tomorrow a pygmy will shoot an elephant.

552
01:21:22,558 --> 01:21:24,526
This forest will be yours.

553
01:23:03,325 --> 01:23:05,418
Don't bring your noise into the forest.

554
01:23:27,916 --> 01:23:30,783
This is as far as our
wheels can carry us.

555
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:37,216
It's two days walk to Boungingi Bai.

556
01:23:37,326 --> 01:23:38,554
What did he say?

557
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:40,753
Just a little walk from here.

558
01:24:15,263 --> 01:24:17,128
That's a big gun for red river hog.

559
01:24:20,702 --> 01:24:23,102
You whites don't want us
to kill elephants.

560
01:24:23,205 --> 01:24:25,230
But, elephant is food for us Bayaka.

561
01:24:25,674 --> 01:24:28,939
Elephant is good. Lot's of meat.

562
01:24:29,044 --> 01:24:33,947
The meat that we'll roast on the coals.

563
01:24:34,049 --> 01:24:37,075
We have plenty meat.

564
01:24:37,185 --> 01:24:41,417
Red river hog, monkey, duikers,
tortoise-

565
01:24:42,157 --> 01:24:45,490
if you let him kill an elephant
government will blame you.

566
01:24:45,594 --> 01:24:49,530
I'm killing the elephant for you.

567
01:24:49,631 --> 01:24:50,222
Why?

568
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:51,924
The Molimo.

569
01:24:55,036 --> 01:24:57,095
You will not be shooting an
elephant while I am in camp.

570
01:24:57,205 --> 01:25:00,572
You don't like meat, why?

571
01:25:03,578 --> 01:25:04,442
I love meat!

572
01:25:04,546 --> 01:25:07,208
What makes you think you own
the forest?

573
01:26:06,208 --> 01:26:07,607
Mr. Yi?

574
01:26:24,826 --> 01:26:26,726
Larry.

575
01:27:37,732 --> 01:27:40,997
Doc did say I'd have good days
and bad days.

576
01:27:42,604 --> 01:27:45,937
If I die here, the Bayaka will
have to leave the forest.

577
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:48,373
Carry my corpse back to Yamondo.

578
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:57,518
Yekko?

579
01:28:17,772 --> 01:28:18,500
There's Lalo,

580
01:28:18,607 --> 01:28:20,336
Sataka is teaching him
to hunt an elephant.

581
01:28:50,305 --> 01:28:52,330
I hate this place.

582
01:29:09,357 --> 01:29:10,790
What are you doing?

583
01:29:10,892 --> 01:29:11,790
Help me.

584
01:29:11,893 --> 01:29:13,087
Where?

585
01:29:50,532 --> 01:29:52,591
They are hunting with spears.

586
01:29:53,835 --> 01:29:54,927
Then you have to do it.

587
01:29:55,036 --> 01:29:56,901
We cannot have a spear wound.

588
01:30:00,375 --> 01:30:03,538
I'm sick and tired of carrying out
your dirty work, all of you!

589
01:30:03,978 --> 01:30:05,502
Here, do it yourself.

590
01:30:05,613 --> 01:30:08,446
Guards, take Yi and follow
the elephant trail.

591
01:30:08,550 --> 01:30:10,347
Christophe, you stay with me.

592
01:30:11,319 --> 01:30:12,445
Bassoun!

593
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:40,978
Sataka!

594
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:46,382
Wait.

595
01:30:46,488 --> 01:30:48,820
I came because you called me.

596
01:30:48,923 --> 01:30:50,982
I am going to give you the Molimo.

597
01:30:51,693 --> 01:30:54,685
I have to hunt this elephant.

598
01:30:54,996 --> 01:30:59,592
Bayaka need the Molimo too.

599
01:31:45,747 --> 01:31:47,271
That's it, he found it.

600
01:32:37,365 --> 01:32:38,662
The Molimo.

601
01:32:45,807 --> 01:32:47,274
The dragon!

602
01:35:42,083 --> 01:35:43,550
Don't be sad.

603
01:35:43,651 --> 01:35:47,815
You wont be sick forever.

604
01:36:11,179 --> 01:36:13,807
Your Africa days are over, Larry.

605
01:37:05,533 --> 01:37:09,469
Our little brothers will be known
through out the world.

606
01:37:09,570 --> 01:37:11,299
Because of me.

607
01:37:11,939 --> 01:37:13,270
Me!

608
01:37:18,646 --> 01:37:20,614
Yee! -Oh Larry.

609
01:37:31,192 --> 01:37:32,853
Let me free!

610
01:38:38,893 --> 01:38:39,882
Larry!

611
01:38:40,828 --> 01:38:41,954
Larry!

612
01:38:46,467 --> 01:38:48,094
''Husband'' of mine,

613
01:38:48,202 --> 01:38:50,966
are you sleeping or are you dead?
