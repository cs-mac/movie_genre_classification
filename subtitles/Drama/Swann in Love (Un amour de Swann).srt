1
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:43,988
SWANN IN LOVE

2
00:02:14,965 --> 00:02:16,721
<i>The air is warm and fresh,</i>

3
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:19,308
<i>full of shadows and dreams.</i>

4
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:31,120
<i>My love for Odette</i>
<i>goes beyond physical desire.</i>

5
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:37,547
<i>It is so caught up</i>
<i>in my actions</i>

6
00:02:37,653 --> 00:02:39,562
<i>my thoughts, my sleep,</i>

7
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:41,837
<i>my life,</i>

8
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:44,525
<i>that without it I'd cease to exist.</i>

9
00:02:52,725 --> 00:02:55,409
May I straighten the orchids
on your bodice?

10
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:03,182
Like that.

11
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:06,162
Tucking them in myself.

12
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,718
What if I smelled them?

13
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,236
<i>I don't know the scent.</i>

14
00:03:35,509 --> 00:03:37,331
<i>Every morning, when I awake,</i>

15
00:03:37,429 --> 00:03:40,396
<i>I feel a now familiar pain.</i>

16
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:43,891
<i>I sacrifice my work,</i>

17
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,444
<i>my pleasures, my friends,</i>

18
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:49,359
<i>my whole life,</i>

19
00:03:49,461 --> 00:03:51,828
<i>to waiting daily</i>
<i>for a rendezvous with Odette.</i>

20
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,704
<i>My love is an illness</i>

21
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,490
<i>that has reached the stage</i>

22
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:32,459
<i>where it cannot be removed</i>
<i>without destroying me.</i>

23
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,169
<i>As surgeons say,</i>

24
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:43,891
<i>it's inoperable.</i>

25
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:20,909
<i>That evening at the theater,</i>

26
00:05:21,013 --> 00:05:23,347
<i>when Baron de Charlus</i>
<i>introduced me to Odette,</i>

27
00:05:24,053 --> 00:05:25,995
<i>I thought she had a certain beauty,</i>

28
00:05:26,645 --> 00:05:28,915
<i>but a kind ofbeauty</i>
<i>to which I was indifferent.</i>

29
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:32,436
<i>In a way, it even repulsed me.</i>

30
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,754
Remind me to stop at my banker's.

31
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:50,413
Very well, sir.

32
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:08,114
- What time is it?
- Nearly 3:00, sir.

33
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:23,022
A good day to you, sir.

34
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:24,686
Thank you, Francois.

35
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:49,550
- Are you still seeing her?
- I haven't for ages.

36
00:06:51,925 --> 00:06:54,740
- Does she write to you?
- Sometimes.

37
00:07:00,917 --> 00:07:04,233
Marquise de Gallardon
and General de Froberville.

38
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:07,371
Why don't you go see her at home?

39
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,037
It would disturb her.

40
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:11,050
And I'm becoming
less attached to her.

41
00:07:11,157 --> 00:07:13,229
- You don't say.
- It's true.

42
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,740
I'm making progress.

43
00:07:14,837 --> 00:07:18,448
Baron de Charlus.
Monsieur Charles Swann.

44
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:24,009
I hardly enjoy being in her bed now.

45
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,980
It's strange.
Sometimes I even find her ugly.

46
00:07:29,076 --> 00:07:30,865
But last night she was ravishing.

47
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:36,653
I thought girls didn't wear fruit.

48
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,933
Did you get my letter?

49
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,244
Will you come?

50
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,212
Kindly wait for the concerto to end.

51
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:07,981
That nose.

52
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:13,710
You saw Odette last night?

53
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,813
Of course. We dined at Prunier.

54
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,438
- Then we went to the Black Cat.
- The Black Cat?

55
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:21,902
That must have been her idea.

56
00:08:22,005 --> 00:08:24,525
No, it was mine.

57
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,800
Really? How strange.

58
00:08:27,988 --> 00:08:30,192
Well, that's not such a bad idea.

59
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:33,524
I'm sure she knew
a lot of people there.

60
00:08:34,517 --> 00:08:36,077
Good day.

61
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:38,864
No, she spoke to no one.

62
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,261
How extraordinary.

63
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,944
So the two of you
just sat there alone?

64
00:08:45,045 --> 00:08:46,867
We did.

65
00:08:46,965 --> 00:08:48,492
- Good day.
- Ladies.

66
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:52,013
You're very kind, Meme.

67
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:54,484
Thank you for taking
such good care of Odette.

68
00:08:58,197 --> 00:08:59,604
Meme...

69
00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:02,570
could you call on her
and mention

70
00:09:02,677 --> 00:09:06,321
that I'll be in Bagatelle Park
after 5:00 this afternoon?

71
00:09:08,117 --> 00:09:11,346
- Where are you going?
- To deliver your message.

72
00:09:11,444 --> 00:09:14,478
But don't tell her it was my idea.

73
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:18,481
If she wants
to come with you, let her.

74
00:09:20,117 --> 00:09:22,353
- Tell me, Meme.
- Yes?

75
00:09:24,437 --> 00:09:26,411
Have you slept with Odette?

76
00:09:29,493 --> 00:09:31,435
Not that I know of.

77
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:03,632
There's your friend Monsieur Swann.

78
00:10:03,732 --> 00:10:06,416
Dear Charles.
I didn't know he was here.

79
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:07,923
He doesn't look well.

80
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:10,443
Sorry, but we've been invited

81
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:12,109
by those people --

82
00:10:12,213 --> 00:10:13,773
What's their name?

83
00:10:13,877 --> 00:10:16,365
- Named after a bridge.
- A bridge?

84
00:10:16,468 --> 00:10:20,494
- Yes, the Ienas. That's it.
- But that's the name of a victory.

85
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:23,248
Napoleonic titles.

86
00:10:23,348 --> 00:10:27,724
- Those people fought like heroes.
- Absolutely.

87
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,157
Charles.

88
00:10:34,805 --> 00:10:36,365
Good day, Bazin.

89
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,356
You're looking well.

90
00:10:38,452 --> 00:10:40,721
Oriane will be glad to see you.

91
00:10:41,397 --> 00:10:43,666
Come, I need your advice.

92
00:10:44,341 --> 00:10:46,032
I want to show you a painting.

93
00:10:46,901 --> 00:10:49,453
Some people say Monsieur Swann

94
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,444
is the sort one can't receive at home.

95
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,842
- Is that true?
- You should know.

96
00:10:53,941 --> 00:10:56,592
You've invited him 50 times,
and he's never come.

97
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,680
My dear Charles.

98
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,592
I had begun to suspect
you were avoiding me.

99
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:10,253
Good day, Oriane.

100
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:16,079
My boredom ends
only when I'm with you.

101
00:11:16,917 --> 00:11:19,283
Why not spend a few days
with us at Guermantes?

102
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:21,235
My mother-in-law would be delighted.

103
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,002
Sorry, but I can't leave Paris just now.

104
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:28,077
- Monsieur Swann.
- Good day, madame.

105
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,028
- Will you stay a while today?
- Of course.

106
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,848
You left in such a rush last time.

107
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:36,877
If you were 20 years older and
had a weak bladder, I'd understand.

108
00:11:38,037 --> 00:11:39,597
Have you seen my brother?

109
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,253
We arrived together,
but he left right away.

110
00:11:42,357 --> 00:11:43,764
Why?

111
00:11:43,861 --> 00:11:45,454
To run an errand.

112
00:11:45,556 --> 00:11:48,852
I hear your cousin Gilbert is dying.

113
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:52,331
He wouldn't die now
and spoil our day.

114
00:11:52,437 --> 00:11:54,803
Your Grace,Jules is back.

115
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,144
And?

116
00:11:56,245 --> 00:11:58,449
He says your cousin is very weak.

117
00:11:58,548 --> 00:12:00,458
He may die at any moment.

118
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:03,117
That means he's alive.
Where there's life, there's hope.

119
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:06,734
I know Gilbert.
In a week he'll be fitter than I.

120
00:12:15,093 --> 00:12:17,646
Marquise de Balleroy.

121
00:12:17,748 --> 00:12:19,603
Madame d'Arpajon.

122
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,188
Princess Sherbatov.

123
00:12:22,292 --> 00:12:24,081
Monsieur de Norpois.

124
00:12:40,405 --> 00:12:42,925
I'm so noisy.
I'll be thrown out.

125
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:47,788
No, I'm fine anywhere.

126
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,259
This footstool is just what I need.

127
00:12:50,357 --> 00:12:52,462
It'll make me sit up straight.

128
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:24,209
Look at Madame de Cambremer.

129
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,676
Indeed.

130
00:13:32,372 --> 00:13:34,412
She has music in her bones.

131
00:13:37,332 --> 00:13:41,042
Our jokes are in charming taste,
my dear Charles.

132
00:13:45,237 --> 00:13:47,408
Pity I never see you anymore.

133
00:13:49,044 --> 00:13:51,183
Life is a dreadful business.

134
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,908
Dreadful.

135
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,940
Some days you'd like to die.

136
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:01,107
But death may be just as boring,

137
00:14:01,205 --> 00:14:03,092
since we don't know what it is.

138
00:14:07,476 --> 00:14:09,199
What I like about you

139
00:14:09,972 --> 00:14:11,882
is that you're not cheerful.

140
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:15,019
Let's spend an evening together.

141
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:24,564
Listen, Charles.

142
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:27,508
Why not come with us later
to the Princess of Parma's?

143
00:14:27,604 --> 00:14:29,644
I'm afraid I'm busy.

144
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,407
Then I'll be off.

145
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:33,069
I'll go with you.

146
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,427
Prince and Princess Pfaffenheim.

147
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:41,260
The Duchess of Chatellerault.

148
00:15:51,924 --> 00:15:54,772
It's ridiculous, an intelligent man
suffering over a woman like that.

149
00:15:54,868 --> 00:15:57,934
She's not even interesting.
An idiot, I hear.

150
00:15:58,036 --> 00:16:00,687
It's funny to see a Jew
the guest of a family

151
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:03,342
that's produced three popes
and I don't know how many cardinals.

152
00:16:05,076 --> 00:16:07,443
I know he's a convert,
and so were his parents.

153
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,704
But they say converts never change.

154
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:15,028
You're right.
These concerts are a bore.

155
00:17:17,141 --> 00:17:18,701
A shot of hooch?

156
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:27,603
A real Titian. What flesh!

157
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,329
Charles, you know me.

158
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:37,514
I'm a modern man. I'm not bigoted.

159
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:41,040
I'd be seen with a black man,
if he were a friend.

160
00:17:42,516 --> 00:17:45,036
To me you're French, that's all.

161
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:50,353
But how can you, a gourmet,

162
00:17:51,957 --> 00:17:54,226
a positive thinker,
an informed collector,

163
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,155
a lover of old books
who sends us the best port wine --

164
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:04,685
how can you jeopardize
your social position?

165
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,229
Because you know that

166
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:13,906
if you married her,
we couldn't receive her.

167
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,468
Yes, I know.

168
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:31,436
- Delighted.
- Good-bye.

169
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,322
- Dear cousin.
- Monsieur Swann's carriage.

170
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:38,130
A pity that creature deprives us
of your most amusing friend.

171
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,099
To a dog in love,
a bitch's ass smells sweet.

172
00:18:42,772 --> 00:18:44,463
<i>Monsieur Swann's carriage is here.</i>

173
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:54,803
- To Bagatelle Park, Remi.
- Very well, sir.

174
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:25,197
Is this table to your liking?

175
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,061
No. This way, please.

176
00:19:31,316 --> 00:19:33,836
- But there are free tables --
- Those tables are reserved.

177
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:38,288
- For whom?
- I said they're reserved.

178
00:19:38,388 --> 00:19:39,948
Aime.

179
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:54,569
I know that at first sight I may not
seem amusing to a young man,

180
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,260
but I'm a mine of experience,

181
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:01,096
a private and invaluable catalogue
of undisclosed information,

182
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:03,179
a guide to the past
and the future.

183
00:20:05,684 --> 00:20:07,091
For example:

184
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,217
Do you know why the head waiter
wouldn't seat you on this side?

185
00:20:12,532 --> 00:20:14,866
- He took you for a Jew.
- I am one.

186
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,674
I have nothing against Jews, mind you.

187
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:21,811
I mean in the arts.
Politics isn't my field.

188
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:23,850
But you know whyJews amaze me?

189
00:20:23,956 --> 00:20:26,673
They love to live on streets
with Catholic names

190
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:29,008
like Saint Honore, Saint Abbess.

191
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:32,586
Where do you live?

192
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,788
- On the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux.
- ""Street of the White Robes.'' You see?

193
00:20:36,884 --> 00:20:40,364
How perverse! A street
named after the humble friars.

194
00:20:40,468 --> 00:20:42,191
An order founded by the sainted --

195
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,827
by...

196
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:46,732
King Louis IX.

197
00:20:49,844 --> 00:20:52,048
Charles, my love.

198
00:20:58,324 --> 00:21:00,593
I went by your house,
but you were out.

199
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:03,539
Monsieur de Forcheville,
Charles Swann.

200
00:21:05,876 --> 00:21:07,437
A hot chocolate?

201
00:21:08,116 --> 00:21:09,938
That's up to this gentleman.

202
00:21:10,036 --> 00:21:12,851
He doesn't like anyone around
when he wants to be with me.

203
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,084
I understand.

204
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,708
You offered to walk with me.

205
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:20,976
Now you'll have to ask his permission.

206
00:21:23,572 --> 00:21:25,612
Excuse me. I'll be off.

207
00:21:25,716 --> 00:21:27,920
You're very kind.

208
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:39,309
See you soon.

209
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:45,003
Your damn coachman again.

210
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,864
Remi is devoted to me.

211
00:21:47,796 --> 00:21:50,796
He annoys me.
He looks at me so insolently.

212
00:21:52,116 --> 00:21:54,963
Then I won't use him when I see you.

213
00:21:55,828 --> 00:21:57,770
Shall we go to your place?

214
00:21:58,292 --> 00:22:00,114
First I want a chocolate.

215
00:22:03,124 --> 00:22:05,328
- Hello, Madame de Crecy.
- Hello, Aime.

216
00:22:05,428 --> 00:22:07,567
- This way.
- Who's this Forcheville?

217
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:10,699
- How's your wife?
- Very well, thank you.

218
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,223
He's a viscount.
Don't you know the family?

219
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,787
Baron de Charlus is waiting.

220
00:22:16,884 --> 00:22:18,706
- And your children?
- Very well.

221
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,005
Where were you?

222
00:22:22,644 --> 00:22:24,749
At my piano lesson.

223
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:29,488
- I hear the Prince of Wales was here.
- So it's rumored.

224
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,431
- I'll leave.
- No, stay.

225
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:36,332
Good day, Baron.

226
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,020
Please have a seat.

227
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:43,026
What may I serve you?

228
00:22:43,124 --> 00:22:44,368
I'm starving.

229
00:22:44,468 --> 00:22:46,857
Some cake or toast then?

230
00:22:47,924 --> 00:22:49,680
Cake and hot chocolate.

231
00:22:51,572 --> 00:22:54,420
I stopped by your place.
That woman was there.

232
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,638
That monocle
makes you look aristocratic.

233
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:08,300
All you need is a title.

234
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:13,068
Viscount, for example.

235
00:23:18,676 --> 00:23:22,320
You look like Bellini's portrait
of Muhammad II. Ever been told that?

236
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,587
You agree, Charles?

237
00:23:25,684 --> 00:23:29,099
Muhammad II fell madly in love
with one of his wives,

238
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:31,059
so he stabbed her to death.

239
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:35,817
- Why?
- To regain his free will.

240
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:49,203
How's your essay on Vermeer going?
Can I see it?

241
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,261
I haven't written much.
I was with the Guermantes.

242
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:56,081
You're wasting your time.
I'd love to get you to work.

243
00:23:56,756 --> 00:23:58,480
If only you'd let me.

244
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:01,229
See you tonight?

245
00:24:02,004 --> 00:24:04,557
The Verdurins
have invited me to a party.

246
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,067
I'll go too.

247
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:09,295
Charles, don't get involved
with that trash.

248
00:24:10,932 --> 00:24:12,874
You're wrong, Meme.

249
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:14,386
The Verdurins are charming

250
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:16,372
and very cultivated.

251
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:18,028
Come on, Charles.

252
00:24:18,131 --> 00:24:20,815
When it comes to art,
they're like fish out of water.

253
00:24:21,492 --> 00:24:26,096
They're very rich,
but unbearably stupid.

254
00:24:26,196 --> 00:24:28,105
Come now, Meme.

255
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:29,772
They know what counts in life.

256
00:24:29,876 --> 00:24:32,243
They're more intelligent
than our friends.

257
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:37,197
Madame Verdurin
does overdo it at times,

258
00:24:37,908 --> 00:24:40,625
but she has a genuine love of painting.

259
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,023
Music, too.

260
00:24:43,124 --> 00:24:45,066
She helps a lot of artists.

261
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:48,490
She discovered Vinteuil

262
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,669
and Elstir, and many others.

263
00:24:51,348 --> 00:24:53,420
I plan to see more of her.

264
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,809
I'm so glad I met you.
You must never leave me now.

265
00:25:04,916 --> 00:25:07,120
You're just the man for me.

266
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,773
I love what you said
about the Verdurins.

267
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:18,602
People are staring.

268
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,196
What does that matter to me?
What can they do?

269
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,139
Look.

270
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,796
There's Remi.

271
00:25:32,307 --> 00:25:34,096
You're always so reserved.

272
00:25:35,252 --> 00:25:36,812
I can't make you out.

273
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:44,812
What a shame.

274
00:25:45,844 --> 00:25:49,073
The orchids don't need
tucking in today.

275
00:25:49,939 --> 00:25:52,492
I can't play my little games.

276
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,650
Promise you'll send him away?

277
00:26:52,564 --> 00:26:56,109
- What are you doing here?
- I've been waiting two hours. We must talk.

278
00:27:00,148 --> 00:27:01,609
Hello.

279
00:27:01,716 --> 00:27:04,137
Go in. I'll only be a minute.

280
00:27:04,979 --> 00:27:06,540
I'll have tea brought in.

281
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,420
Then we'll play ""orchids.''

282
00:27:18,388 --> 00:27:19,468
Odette.

283
00:27:20,339 --> 00:27:22,478
I have a very interesting
proposition for you.

284
00:27:23,252 --> 00:27:26,635
A society lady who goes
to brothels saw you around --

285
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,463
<i>Not now. Shut up.</i>

286
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,564
<i>Name your price.</i>
<i>She'll pay anything.</i>

287
00:27:31,668 --> 00:27:33,969
- <i>I'll handle it for you.</i>
- <i>Not now.</i>

288
00:27:34,068 --> 00:27:36,370
<i>Don't come here again.</i>
<i>You can write me.</i>

289
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,587
She waited two hours for me.

290
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,809
She said I could name my price.

291
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,643
She had an ambassador who said,

292
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,035
""I'll kill myself if I can't have her.''

293
00:28:18,676 --> 00:28:20,748
You should have heard me.

294
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:23,758
I said, ""No.''

295
00:28:23,859 --> 00:28:25,266
After all,

296
00:28:25,363 --> 00:28:27,338
I'm free to do what I want.

297
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,671
If I needed money,
it would be different.

298
00:28:32,308 --> 00:28:34,861
Did you ever go to brothels?

299
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,265
Me? That's all I need.

300
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:41,005
As you saw,
it's not for lack of offers.

301
00:28:43,507 --> 00:28:45,679
I'll tell the concierge
not to let her in.

302
00:28:47,476 --> 00:28:50,159
I wish you'd been hidden
in a corner somewhere.

303
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,325
I think you would have
been proud of me.

304
00:28:55,987 --> 00:29:00,592
She has some good in her,
after all, your little Odette.

305
00:29:00,691 --> 00:29:04,815
If she asked you, she must've
thought you might accept.

306
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,278
I can't tell you anything.

307
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,471
Lemon or cream?

308
00:29:23,571 --> 00:29:24,815
Cream.

309
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:31,758
Just a drop.

310
00:29:32,532 --> 00:29:34,898
See? I know what you like.

311
00:29:45,395 --> 00:29:48,145
Odette, my darling,

312
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:51,891
I know I'm being awful,
but I must ask you a few things.

313
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:56,784
Remember what I suspected
about you and Madame Verdurin?

314
00:30:01,204 --> 00:30:02,797
Was it true

315
00:30:03,379 --> 00:30:05,354
with her or anyone else?

316
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,320
Who put such an idea in your head?

317
00:30:10,996 --> 00:30:12,556
I don't understand.

318
00:30:15,667 --> 00:30:17,260
What do you mean?

319
00:30:23,636 --> 00:30:27,280
Have you ever done things
with women?

320
00:30:29,332 --> 00:30:30,892
With women? No.

321
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:36,882
Are you sure?

322
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,283
You know I haven't.

323
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,940
Don't say it that way.

324
00:30:41,043 --> 00:30:43,116
Say, ""I've never done
such things with any woman.''

325
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,423
At my age, I need to know the truth.

326
00:30:45,523 --> 00:30:48,305
I've never done such things
with any woman.

327
00:30:49,331 --> 00:30:51,917
Will you swear
on your medallion of the Virgin Mary?

328
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,573
Stop this nonsense.

329
00:30:55,731 --> 00:30:57,291
What's wrong with you today?

330
00:30:58,292 --> 00:31:00,397
You want to make me hate you.

331
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,772
I wouldn't hold it against you.

332
00:31:06,451 --> 00:31:08,012
Not in the least.

333
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,786
I always know more than I say.

334
00:31:21,715 --> 00:31:23,439
If I'm angry with you,

335
00:31:24,116 --> 00:31:27,018
it's not because of what you do --
I love you, hence I forgive you --

336
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:32,689
but because of your ridiculous lying!

337
00:31:33,523 --> 00:31:35,083
Why deny things I know?

338
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:39,600
You can end it in a second,

339
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:41,900
be free of it forever.

340
00:31:42,004 --> 00:31:45,353
Swear on your medallion
that you've never done it.

341
00:31:46,067 --> 00:31:47,628
I don't know.

342
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:51,345
Maybe a long time ago,
without realizing what I was doing.

343
00:31:51,444 --> 00:31:53,167
Maybe two or three times.

344
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:10,259
That's it.

345
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,587
Tell me,

346
00:32:17,683 --> 00:32:19,439
was it with anyone I know?

347
00:32:23,411 --> 00:32:24,972
Of course not.

348
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,660
I swear.

349
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,729
Besides, I think I exaggerated.

350
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:36,782
I never went that far.

351
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,986
No matter.

352
00:32:41,203 --> 00:32:44,978
But it's a shame
you can't at least give me the name.

353
00:32:49,331 --> 00:32:52,015
If I had an idea of the person,

354
00:32:52,115 --> 00:32:54,482
I could forget about her

355
00:32:55,955 --> 00:32:57,843
and not pester you.

356
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:03,499
What's terrible

357
00:33:04,564 --> 00:33:07,281
is what one can't imagine.

358
00:33:12,788 --> 00:33:13,715
But...

359
00:33:15,763 --> 00:33:17,869
you've been so sweet to me.

360
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:21,899
I don't want to tire you.

361
00:33:22,579 --> 00:33:25,165
I thank you with all my heart.

362
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:27,980
That's it.

363
00:33:34,164 --> 00:33:36,717
But tell me, how long ago?

364
00:33:37,971 --> 00:33:40,175
Can't you see you're killing me?

365
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:44,459
It's all ancient history.

366
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:47,244
I've never thought about it since.

367
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:52,139
Are you trying to put those ideas
back in my head?

368
00:33:53,203 --> 00:33:55,211
A lot of good it would do.

369
00:33:57,171 --> 00:33:59,921
Was it since I've known you?

370
00:34:08,595 --> 00:34:10,155
Did it happen here?

371
00:34:11,795 --> 00:34:13,618
At least tell me
what night it was,

372
00:34:13,715 --> 00:34:16,236
so I can remember
what I was doing that evening.

373
00:34:16,339 --> 00:34:19,307
And don't say you don't know
who it was, because that's impossible.

374
00:34:19,411 --> 00:34:21,298
I don't know.

375
00:34:34,355 --> 00:34:36,559
I think it was in the park,

376
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:39,631
the evening you met us on the island.

377
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:41,839
Remember?

378
00:34:44,339 --> 00:34:47,373
There was a woman at the next table.

379
00:34:48,692 --> 00:34:51,058
I hadn't seen her in ages.

380
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,740
She said to me,

381
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:55,916
""Come behind the rock

382
00:34:57,139 --> 00:35:00,619
and look at the moonlight
in the water.''

383
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:04,940
First I yawned,

384
00:35:05,651 --> 00:35:09,296
then I answered,
""I'm tired. I'm fine where I am.''

385
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:12,080
She kept at me.

386
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:15,311
""You should. You've never seen
moonlight like this.''

387
00:35:15,987 --> 00:35:17,710
I said, ""That's a good one.''

388
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,158
I knew what she was after.

389
00:35:30,931 --> 00:35:32,687
You're a scoundrel.

390
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:35,759
You enjoy torturing me, don't you?

391
00:35:37,043 --> 00:35:39,083
You make me tell lies,

392
00:35:39,187 --> 00:35:40,594
which I do

393
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:42,578
only so you'll leave me alone.

394
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,178
I never realized it was so recent.

395
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:55,212
Forgive me.

396
00:35:57,235 --> 00:35:59,090
I know I'm hurting you.

397
00:36:01,171 --> 00:36:03,953
It's all over and forgotten.

398
00:36:29,779 --> 00:36:30,859
So...

399
00:36:30,964 --> 00:36:32,524
shall we play ""orchids''?

400
00:36:32,627 --> 00:36:35,627
Not now.
I have to get dressed.

401
00:36:35,731 --> 00:36:37,291
Are you going out?

402
00:36:37,395 --> 00:36:39,337
- Where?
- The opera.

403
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:41,418
I told you I was seeing the Verdurins.

404
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:45,100
- You just said a dinner party.
- A supper.

405
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,375
And first we're going to the opera.

406
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:54,674
- To hear what?
- <i>A Night with Cleopatra.</i>

407
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:56,331
By Victor Masse.

408
00:36:57,363 --> 00:36:59,600
You can't listen
to that despicable music.

409
00:37:00,755 --> 00:37:02,544
Do you think I have no taste?

410
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,548
You do...

411
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:07,211
your own.

412
00:37:15,124 --> 00:37:16,684
That's cold.

413
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:30,352
Suppose I asked you not to go?

414
00:37:31,027 --> 00:37:32,588
Why would you?

415
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:36,305
Not because of <i>A Night with Cleopatra.</i>

416
00:37:36,403 --> 00:37:37,996
That's not why.

417
00:37:39,987 --> 00:37:42,834
I'm asking you
not to go out this evening

418
00:37:44,723 --> 00:37:48,684
to see if you love me enough
to forego a pleasure.

419
00:37:49,555 --> 00:37:51,115
I must know who you are.

420
00:37:51,955 --> 00:37:55,916
How can I love you if you're like
water flowing any which way,

421
00:37:56,019 --> 00:37:58,321
a fish with no memory, no will?

422
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:02,059
Your sermons will make me
miss the overture.

423
00:38:06,995 --> 00:38:09,362
I'm only asking this for your sake.

424
00:38:15,187 --> 00:38:17,260
In a way, I'd rather
you didn't stay with me.

425
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:19,054
I've got a lot to do tonight.

426
00:38:19,155 --> 00:38:21,576
Then do it. I won't stop you.

427
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:24,777
You're far less intelligent
than I thought.

428
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:26,607
Excuse me, sir.

429
00:38:57,363 --> 00:39:00,298
I've changed my mind.
I'll come with you.

430
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:04,775
It'll do me some good
to see how low people can sink.

431
00:39:06,643 --> 00:39:08,465
You're not in evening clothes.

432
00:39:10,035 --> 00:39:12,271
You only want to flaunt our affair.

433
00:39:14,163 --> 00:39:15,789
You treat me like a whore.

434
00:39:16,723 --> 00:39:18,130
Give me my cloak.

435
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,879
Earlier, in Bagatelle Park,

436
00:39:21,843 --> 00:39:23,632
all you did was talk to Charlus.

437
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,482
You paid just as little
attention to me

438
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,946
as he did to his young
portrait of Muhammad.

439
00:39:36,563 --> 00:39:38,472
Some people do think

440
00:39:39,219 --> 00:39:41,936
I behave rather foolishly.

441
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:45,838
I let you stay till the last minute,

442
00:39:45,939 --> 00:39:47,979
and this is how you thank me.

443
00:39:48,083 --> 00:39:50,188
I'll know better next time.

444
00:39:55,379 --> 00:39:58,314
Can't I kiss you after the dinner?

445
00:40:00,435 --> 00:40:01,842
It'll be very late.

446
00:40:02,418 --> 00:40:03,979
For a second,
before going home,

447
00:40:04,083 --> 00:40:05,644
to help me sleep.

448
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:15,026
You'll return?

449
00:40:15,699 --> 00:40:17,260
<i>Will it be soon?</i>

450
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:31,595
To the opera.

451
00:40:43,795 --> 00:40:45,519
Do you know this address?

452
00:40:49,458 --> 00:40:51,498
I think we've been there before, sir.

453
00:40:51,603 --> 00:40:53,163
Well, let's go again.

454
00:41:05,074 --> 00:41:06,635
Open the door.

455
00:41:10,675 --> 00:41:14,953
These gentlemen want Miss Naomi.
Tell her to wait in the Persian Room.

456
00:41:15,859 --> 00:41:18,347
Hurry it up.
Number 15 is taking too long.

457
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:23,178
- This way, sir.
- Good evening.

458
00:41:23,283 --> 00:41:24,690
Tell me,

459
00:41:24,787 --> 00:41:28,910
a pretty woman,
blonde, with sad eyes,

460
00:41:29,011 --> 00:41:31,345
tall, around 30 years old.

461
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:34,801
- Has she ever been here?
- I don't know her.

462
00:41:34,899 --> 00:41:37,484
Her name is Odette de Crecy.

463
00:41:37,587 --> 00:41:39,310
Why would she have come here?

464
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:42,280
I don't know.
To meet someone.

465
00:41:42,387 --> 00:41:43,794
No, I can't place her.

466
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:47,947
You understand that
we don't give out such information.

467
00:41:48,787 --> 00:41:50,347
Of course.

468
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,479
The lady lived in Nice.

469
00:41:58,163 --> 00:42:01,479
They say her mother sold her at 14
to a rich Englishman.

470
00:42:01,587 --> 00:42:03,147
Such things happen.

471
00:42:04,115 --> 00:42:05,130
Mimi.

472
00:42:05,298 --> 00:42:07,753
I've been told of someone named

473
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:09,103
Chloe.

474
00:42:09,203 --> 00:42:11,210
""If you want to know more
about Odette de Crecy,

475
00:42:11,314 --> 00:42:12,875
go to 6 Rue Budreau
and ask for Chloe.''

476
00:42:12,978 --> 00:42:17,419
She's not very bright,
but she's sweet. You'll see.

477
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,299
She's from Nice, too.

478
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:21,964
What a coincidence.

479
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:30,575
It seems that everyone in Nice
knows of Odette de Crecy.

480
00:42:31,891 --> 00:42:33,298
Who is she?

481
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:36,946
You heard no talk of her in Nice?

482
00:42:44,306 --> 00:42:45,899
Must be a false name.

483
00:42:50,226 --> 00:42:51,787
I knew an Odette.

484
00:42:57,363 --> 00:42:58,956
Who liked women?

485
00:42:59,058 --> 00:43:01,775
Well, you know,
that's not so unusual.

486
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:07,211
There was one who always came
with a very fashionable lady.

487
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:10,444
They'd spend hours in their cubicle.

488
00:43:11,123 --> 00:43:13,873
When they came out, the lady
would give me a 10-franc tip.

489
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:16,840
You can shower with a friend
in all innocence.

490
00:43:16,946 --> 00:43:21,070
If they had just been knitting,
they wouldn't have given me 10 francs.

491
00:43:21,171 --> 00:43:23,986
You should have seen the girl quiver.

492
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:27,218
She'd tell the other,
""This is ecstasy.''

493
00:43:28,531 --> 00:43:31,378
She'd get so excited
she couldn't keep from biting her.

494
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:36,626
- Was her name Odette?
- I think so.

495
00:43:38,066 --> 00:43:40,171
Which of the two was Odette?

496
00:43:40,275 --> 00:43:42,958
I'm sorry, sir,
but I can't remember.

497
00:43:43,859 --> 00:43:47,175
I only wanted to say that
all society women are perverse.

498
00:43:47,283 --> 00:43:48,843
It's shocking.

499
00:43:51,987 --> 00:43:53,231
Wasn't I all right, sir?

500
00:44:57,939 --> 00:45:00,044
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening, Francois.

501
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:43,211
A gentleman like you

502
00:46:44,083 --> 00:46:45,970
living in a place like this.

503
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:47,627
You surprise me.

504
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:56,585
She looks like you, don't you think?

505
00:46:58,866 --> 00:47:02,511
The high cheekbones,
the shape of the neck,

506
00:47:03,187 --> 00:47:04,594
the heavy eyelids.

507
00:47:06,675 --> 00:47:09,195
- The sad eyes.
- Who is she?

508
00:47:10,834 --> 00:47:14,217
Zephora,Jethro's daughter.
It's by Botticelli.

509
00:47:14,898 --> 00:47:17,419
He did it as a fresco
in the 15th century

510
00:47:17,522 --> 00:47:19,759
on a wall of the Sistine Chapel.

511
00:47:21,906 --> 00:47:24,656
I'm not a museum piece.

512
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:29,930
This is where you sleep?

513
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,498
It's an 18th-century bed.

514
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:36,651
I have a friend who has
only period furniture.

515
00:47:36,754 --> 00:47:38,347
Which period?

516
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:41,870
Medieval. It's all made of wood.

517
00:48:43,570 --> 00:48:45,578
You're so reserved.

518
00:48:47,027 --> 00:48:48,718
I wish I knew what you liked,

519
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:55,340
what goes on behind that busy brow.

520
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,872
Forgive me.

521
00:49:17,426 --> 00:49:18,987
I'm disturbing you.

522
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:21,065
Thank you for seeing me.

523
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:24,562
Not at all. Stay.

524
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:28,523
Promise you'll return.

525
00:49:38,482 --> 00:49:42,312
I suppose you're very busy, too.

526
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,796
I never have anything to do.

527
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:48,524
I'm always free.

528
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:00,465
I always will be for you.

529
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,602
Send for me anytime,
day or night.

530
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:05,577
I'll gladly come running.

531
00:50:15,506 --> 00:50:18,353
Will you call me often?

532
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:21,707
Forgive me,

533
00:50:23,027 --> 00:50:25,099
but new friendships frighten me.

534
00:50:27,219 --> 00:50:29,106
You fear affection?

535
00:50:29,778 --> 00:50:31,339
How odd.

536
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:33,898
That's all I look for.

537
00:50:35,090 --> 00:50:37,425
I'd give my soul to find it.

538
00:50:40,818 --> 00:50:43,403
I knocked, sir.
Didn't you hear me?

539
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,050
Will you be dining at home?
Shall I set the table?

540
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:49,514
No, I'm going out.

541
00:50:49,618 --> 00:50:51,505
Get my dinner clothes ready,

542
00:50:51,602 --> 00:50:53,163
and tell Remi.

543
00:50:53,266 --> 00:50:55,154
He's just stabled the horses.

544
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:57,138
He's to harness them, quickly.

545
00:50:58,674 --> 00:51:01,522
We must be at the opera
before it ends.

546
00:51:02,962 --> 00:51:05,231
Your scarf, sir.

547
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,890
Throw it down.

548
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:30,890
Hurry, Remi.

549
00:51:52,594 --> 00:51:54,001
Do you know Madame Verdurin?

550
00:51:54,098 --> 00:51:56,073
There was a group
in her box tonight.

551
00:51:56,178 --> 00:51:58,251
- Have they left?
- Everyone's gone.

552
00:51:58,354 --> 00:52:01,224
Go and ask at the subscriber's door.

553
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:47,659
- All we can do is go home, sir.
- Certainly not.

554
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,058
We have to find her.

555
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:52,754
I forgot to say something
to Madame de Crecy.

556
00:52:53,586 --> 00:52:56,652
She'll be annoyed and hurt
if I don't talk to her tonight.

557
00:52:56,754 --> 00:52:58,314
It's very important.

558
00:52:58,418 --> 00:53:01,898
Sorry, sir,
but how can she be annoyed

559
00:53:02,002 --> 00:53:04,849
if she's the one
who went off without you?

560
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:10,446
She's dining with the Verdurins
in some restaurant nearby.

561
00:53:10,546 --> 00:53:12,269
We'll find her.

562
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,192
But which one, sir?

563
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:17,770
Go find out.
Ask at Prevost's, at the Maison Doree.

564
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,599
Hold the horses for me.

565
00:53:23,282 --> 00:53:24,842
Hurry up!

566
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:43,402
<i>Where are you rushing off to</i>

567
00:53:45,042 --> 00:53:52,199
<i>Death comes soon enough</i>

568
00:53:57,810 --> 00:53:59,949
<i>Where are you rushing off to</i>

569
00:54:00,050 --> 00:54:07,120
<i>Death comes soon enough</i>

570
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:16,014
<i>How many, heeding only hatred</i>

571
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:20,103
- <i>Go off to faraway places</i>
- Good evening.

572
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,730
- Do you know my friend?
- Would you like to join us?

573
00:54:22,834 --> 00:54:25,070
Good evening. No, thank you.

574
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,188
I see you have a carriage, sir.

575
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:45,233
Would be so kind
as to give me a ride?

576
00:54:45,938 --> 00:54:48,142
I didn't find the lady, sir.

577
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,163
Remind me to order
some firewood tomorrow.

578
00:54:53,842 --> 00:54:56,046
I think we're running out of it.

579
00:55:21,906 --> 00:55:23,466
Stop here.

580
00:55:38,994 --> 00:55:40,717
Are the Verdurins here?

581
00:55:40,818 --> 00:55:44,942
They rented the banquet rooms
for tonight. Are you a guest?

582
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:49,319
Remi, get something to eat.
This may take quite a while.

583
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,697
And here's the piano.

584
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:06,990
Not so loud.
The president's next door.

585
00:56:07,954 --> 00:56:10,954
But this is a democracy.
He of all people should know that.

586
00:56:16,722 --> 00:56:18,128
Good evening.

587
00:56:18,226 --> 00:56:21,609
- A white dress -- how original.
- As in original sin.

588
00:56:21,714 --> 00:56:25,609
- Who is this president next door?
- The president of the republic.

589
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,945
What a privilege to be with you.

590
00:56:29,042 --> 00:56:30,897
Hello, Charles.

591
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:35,370
Even when you're unexpected,
you're always welcome.

592
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:39,792
Good evening.
I was just passing by and --

593
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,273
Do you know Monsieur de Forcheville?
Odette brought him.

594
00:56:43,378 --> 00:56:44,655
Yes.

595
00:56:44,754 --> 00:56:46,991
It's always a pleasure to see you.

596
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:50,351
- Who could say no to you, angel?
- No, but you're the one who --

597
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,352
Hush. I didn't ask your opinion.
I say you're an angel.

598
00:56:54,034 --> 00:56:55,441
Good evening.

599
00:56:55,538 --> 00:56:58,472
<i>A Night with Cleopatra</i>
is over most people's heads.

600
00:56:58,578 --> 00:57:00,814
It makes you want
to see the pyramids.

601
00:57:00,914 --> 00:57:02,856
Why don't we sail up the Nile?

602
00:57:02,962 --> 00:57:05,645
- Let's organize that.
- Good idea.

603
00:57:05,746 --> 00:57:08,113
- Where are you going, Doctor?
- To visit a patient.

604
00:57:08,210 --> 00:57:09,355
No, don't go.

605
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:12,142
He'll surely be better off
if you don't disturb him.

606
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:14,828
Stay here and you'll find him
cured tomorrow.

607
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,929
Look at Odette.
I didn't seat her next to a bore.

608
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:20,903
My dear, would you like to sail
down the Nile in a felucca?

609
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:23,530
I'm like you.
I enjoy matchmaking.

610
00:57:23,634 --> 00:57:26,503
I've arranged quite a few,
even between women.

611
00:57:29,586 --> 00:57:31,495
He's hilarious.

612
00:57:32,178 --> 00:57:35,309
It would be nice if Biche told us
about the art show he saw today.

613
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,297
Yes, let us in on it.

614
00:57:38,162 --> 00:57:42,603
I stuck my nose in one painting
to see how it was done.

615
00:57:43,634 --> 00:57:45,608
It was impossible to say

616
00:57:45,714 --> 00:57:49,194
if it was done with glue,
with bronze,

617
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:52,462
with paint, with rubies,
with sunlight,

618
00:57:52,562 --> 00:57:55,246
or with pee-pee or with caca.

619
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,690
It's all there, and it smells good.

620
00:57:59,793 --> 00:58:02,314
It takes your breath away,
it tickles you,

621
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:03,824
and it's shit!

622
00:58:06,322 --> 00:58:08,078
Really, I swear!

623
00:58:08,754 --> 00:58:11,437
This is called epic exaggeration.

624
00:58:14,193 --> 00:58:16,103
I tell you it's shit!

625
00:58:17,554 --> 00:58:19,943
- That's marvelous.
- The fact is

626
00:58:20,049 --> 00:58:21,959
that the Egyptians were extraordinary.

627
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:27,467
While we Europeans
were still living in caves,

628
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:29,458
they'd already invented
the Immaculate Conception.

629
00:58:38,162 --> 00:58:39,755
What's wrong with her?

630
00:58:39,857 --> 00:58:42,541
She's dislocated her jaw.
Quick, Doctor!

631
00:58:46,258 --> 00:58:48,527
Don't touch her.

632
00:58:48,626 --> 00:58:50,481
Keep calm.

633
00:58:50,577 --> 00:58:52,465
It's nothing.
It's happened before.

634
00:59:03,666 --> 00:59:06,032
There.
That's all there is to it.

635
00:59:06,706 --> 00:59:08,266
Don't talk for a while.

636
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,344
Let's hear some music.

637
00:59:10,450 --> 00:59:15,185
My nephew will play
the little sonata for Monsieur Swann.

638
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:18,762
Not my sonata. It makes me cry
and gives me a headache.

639
00:59:18,865 --> 00:59:20,840
I told you not to talk.

640
00:59:20,945 --> 00:59:22,768
But I'm doomed to a week in bed.

641
00:59:22,865 --> 00:59:25,232
-Just the andante.
- The andante?

642
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,533
That's the part that breaks me up.

643
00:59:27,634 --> 00:59:30,252
Thanks a lot. Wonderful man,
my better half.

644
00:59:30,354 --> 00:59:34,576
You won't be ill.
And if you are, I'll cure you.

645
00:59:35,410 --> 00:59:36,817
You promise?

646
00:59:36,914 --> 00:59:38,474
Promis-cuity.

647
00:59:40,882 --> 00:59:42,638
Please, don't make me laugh again.

648
00:59:42,738 --> 00:59:44,298
Go easy on her, Doctor.

649
00:59:48,466 --> 00:59:50,026
Is everybody ready?

650
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,242
You don't bother being discreet
around Forcheville.

651
01:00:25,361 --> 01:00:27,947
I'm sure he loved
<i>A Night with Cleopatra.</i>

652
01:00:29,010 --> 01:00:31,431
I didn't know he'd be here.

653
01:00:31,538 --> 01:00:34,537
Madame Verdurin invited him
at the last minute.

654
01:00:40,017 --> 01:00:41,424
Listen.

655
01:00:42,418 --> 01:00:45,200
It's the national anthem of our love.

656
01:00:55,569 --> 01:00:57,457
I'm so glad you came.

657
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,294
You must take care of me.

658
01:01:17,361 --> 01:01:19,980
You've put substance in my life

659
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:24,622
and grace in my heart.

660
01:01:27,474 --> 01:01:31,947
Thanks to you, the whole world
is bathed in a mysterious light.

661
01:01:34,833 --> 01:01:37,833
If you only knew
how dry my life was before you.

662
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:54,794
Have you been to Egypt?

663
01:01:57,937 --> 01:02:00,043
Is it beautiful?

664
01:02:00,145 --> 01:02:01,639
Yes, very.

665
01:02:02,225 --> 01:02:04,527
Everyone says I should go.

666
01:02:06,161 --> 01:02:08,103
I'll come along if you like.

667
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,065
We'll rent a boat.

668
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:13,063
You'd rent a boat? You would?

669
01:02:13,745 --> 01:02:15,152
Of course.

670
01:02:16,977 --> 01:02:18,384
Remarkable.

671
01:02:23,697 --> 01:02:26,545
Odette, someone's whispering
sweet nothings to you.

672
01:02:26,642 --> 01:02:28,202
Yes, very sweet.

673
01:02:28,305 --> 01:02:31,153
We like your friend Forcheville.
He's straightforward and charming.

674
01:02:33,137 --> 01:02:36,617
That piano playing sounded
better than an orchestra.

675
01:02:36,722 --> 01:02:39,569
I'd love to repay
the Verdurins' kindness.

676
01:02:40,369 --> 01:02:42,573
You'd go to Egypt with them?

677
01:02:42,674 --> 01:02:44,234
They really want me to.

678
01:02:46,258 --> 01:02:47,818
You mean without me...

679
01:02:48,401 --> 01:02:50,506
and with Forcheville?

680
01:02:50,610 --> 01:02:52,497
What could make you
think such a thing?

681
01:02:54,577 --> 01:02:56,781
I'm so stupid.

682
01:02:56,882 --> 01:02:59,729
Spending my money
for other people's pleasure.

683
01:03:00,850 --> 01:03:04,330
But don't push me too far,

684
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:06,572
or you'll end up with nothing.

685
01:03:08,817 --> 01:03:12,395
As for that little woman
with her roving eye...

686
01:03:12,497 --> 01:03:14,123
And what a body.

687
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:17,608
I'd rather have her
in my bed than fleas.

688
01:03:17,713 --> 01:03:19,120
Friends, let's go home.

689
01:03:19,217 --> 01:03:20,777
It's after 2:00.

690
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:30,185
Your husband's charming. So witty.
Doctors are so well-informed.

691
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:31,850
You know him?

692
01:03:31,953 --> 01:03:35,052
He's always hobnobbing
with the Guermantes.

693
01:03:35,153 --> 01:03:36,976
They deserve him.

694
01:03:37,073 --> 01:03:40,554
They say the old dowager
is permanently drunk.

695
01:03:40,657 --> 01:03:42,665
Not in my home.

696
01:03:42,769 --> 01:03:44,711
But she's a duchess.

697
01:03:44,818 --> 01:03:46,956
Good night.
Sweet dreams.

698
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:50,288
Your nephew has a brilliant future.

699
01:03:53,041 --> 01:03:54,864
- Good night, boss.
- Good night.

700
01:03:54,961 --> 01:03:57,034
My dear Odette,
thank you for tonight.

701
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:58,698
Thank you for coming.

702
01:04:00,946 --> 01:04:03,946
- Thank you, Odette. Good night.
- Good night, Doctor.

703
01:04:06,194 --> 01:04:09,194
- Shall I take you home?
- Of course.

704
01:04:14,001 --> 01:04:15,562
What do you think of Forcheville?

705
01:04:16,817 --> 01:04:18,224
He's vile.

706
01:04:18,641 --> 01:04:22,438
Did you hear what he said to her
during the sonata?

707
01:04:22,801 --> 01:04:26,347
She's charming,
but hardly an angel.

708
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:29,745
Don't slander her. True, she's no saint,
but don't slander her.

709
01:04:29,842 --> 01:04:32,842
But if she were more virtuous,
wouldn't she be less charming?

710
01:04:33,361 --> 01:04:35,466
Does asking a question answer it?

711
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:38,346
Wait for me here.

712
01:04:41,522 --> 01:04:43,726
I'll give you a ride home in my wagon.

713
01:04:47,089 --> 01:04:49,423
So we'll see you tomorrow night?

714
01:04:49,521 --> 01:04:51,660
For a Moonlight Sonata
in pitch darkness.

715
01:04:51,762 --> 01:04:53,704
Good night.

716
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,938
Good-bye, my friends.

717
01:04:58,097 --> 01:04:59,341
Good-bye, friends.

718
01:05:02,161 --> 01:05:03,568
Good night, Charles.

719
01:05:07,122 --> 01:05:10,056
- Forcheville, come with us.
- Gladly.

720
01:05:10,162 --> 01:05:11,984
- Good-bye.
- Good night.

721
01:05:13,394 --> 01:05:15,979
Don't take up so much room.

722
01:05:17,042 --> 01:05:20,490
""The woods are still dark,
yet the sky is already light...''

723
01:05:20,593 --> 01:05:23,048
To the station!

724
01:05:23,154 --> 01:05:24,561
Good-bye, friends!

725
01:05:30,513 --> 01:05:32,456
Odette, need a ride?

726
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:35,658
There's room
next to Monsieur Forcheville.

727
01:05:42,417 --> 01:05:45,930
- I thought I was taking you home.
- I'm tired. I want to go to bed early.

728
01:05:47,889 --> 01:05:50,955
Go on home. We let you
have her to yourself so often.

729
01:05:51,057 --> 01:05:52,617
Get in, dear heart.

730
01:05:55,569 --> 01:05:57,609
I have something important to tell her.

731
01:05:57,714 --> 01:05:59,437
Then write to her.

732
01:06:02,193 --> 01:06:05,193
Did you see that?
I thought he'd eat me alive.

733
01:06:20,594 --> 01:06:22,960
Your ears must have
been ringing tonight.

734
01:06:24,113 --> 01:06:28,554
Odette never stops talking about you.
And only nice things.

735
01:06:32,913 --> 01:06:34,702
Emilie. Are you coming?

736
01:06:35,377 --> 01:06:36,938
Don't believe me?

737
01:06:37,617 --> 01:06:39,178
She adores you.

738
01:06:40,881 --> 01:06:42,539
She's a real friend to you.

739
01:06:43,377 --> 01:06:46,247
If you don't know that already,
you must be the only one.

740
01:06:46,353 --> 01:06:48,077
Good night.

741
01:06:48,177 --> 01:06:51,025
At last. I thought you were
going off with him.

742
01:06:55,601 --> 01:06:57,968
Are you all right, sir?

743
01:06:58,065 --> 01:06:59,472
Did something happen to you?

744
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:03,466
No, Remi.

745
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:05,898
I think I'll walk a bit.

746
01:07:06,834 --> 01:07:08,394
Follow me.

747
01:07:28,593 --> 01:07:30,154
She's so vulgar!

748
01:07:30,257 --> 01:07:31,818
Poor little thing!

749
01:07:34,449 --> 01:07:36,010
And so stupid!

750
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:38,599
That other woman's a pimp!

751
01:07:38,705 --> 01:07:40,080
Verdurin!

752
01:07:41,809 --> 01:07:43,434
A procuress!

753
01:07:43,537 --> 01:07:48,207
That Verdurin woman's
the bottom of the barrel!

754
01:07:48,305 --> 01:07:50,891
Thinks she loves art. The fool!

755
01:07:50,994 --> 01:07:52,903
And all that vile humor!

756
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:54,952
I wanted to save Odette
from all that!

757
01:07:55,057 --> 01:07:58,734
They're the scum of the earth!
Dante's last circle!

758
01:08:00,369 --> 01:08:03,686
Why do I subject myself
to such humiliation?

759
01:08:05,009 --> 01:08:07,082
I used to think Odette was ugly!

760
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:09,840
I had to go fall in love with her

761
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:11,880
because she reminded me
of a Botticelli.

762
01:08:11,985 --> 01:08:14,505
Now I've decided to fall
out of love with her, and I can't.

763
01:08:15,409 --> 01:08:17,296
I can't.

764
01:08:21,937 --> 01:08:23,311
Tonight...

765
01:08:25,554 --> 01:08:27,593
Tonight, I finally understand

766
01:08:29,233 --> 01:08:30,892
that her love for me --

767
01:08:36,017 --> 01:08:37,577
which I rejected at first --

768
01:08:38,257 --> 01:08:42,087
that the feelings she had for me

769
01:08:43,345 --> 01:08:45,036
will never be revived.

770
01:08:47,569 --> 01:08:50,090
But without her I will cease to exist.

771
01:08:53,809 --> 01:08:55,784
It's an illness

772
01:08:56,785 --> 01:08:58,508
that could prove fatal.

773
01:08:59,665 --> 01:09:01,901
And yet I'm afraid of being cured.

774
01:09:04,689 --> 01:09:06,347
Sometimes I tell myself

775
01:09:07,217 --> 01:09:09,454
it would be best if Odette died

776
01:09:11,089 --> 01:09:14,405
painlessly, in an accident.

777
01:09:17,937 --> 01:09:19,760
It would be over.

778
01:09:28,785 --> 01:09:31,632
You said we were going
to look at the moon.

779
01:09:34,066 --> 01:09:37,065
The greatest of follies is to despise
feelings you don't share!

780
01:09:40,337 --> 01:09:42,159
I love darkness. You fear it.

781
01:09:43,153 --> 01:09:44,746
Good-bye.

782
01:09:44,849 --> 01:09:48,461
My affection for you
is dead and beyond resuscitation.

783
01:09:48,977 --> 01:09:50,700
I didn't mean to offend you.

784
01:09:50,801 --> 01:09:52,459
Who said I was offended?

785
01:09:52,562 --> 01:09:55,115
Don't you know
what an exceptional person I am?

786
01:10:02,129 --> 01:10:03,984
For the best of us,

787
01:10:04,721 --> 01:10:08,999
studying the arts, our collections,
our fine gardens are all but substitutes.

788
01:10:10,993 --> 01:10:15,085
Like Diogenes in his barrel,
we are seeking a man.

789
01:10:15,954 --> 01:10:18,059
We grow yews and begonias,

790
01:10:18,897 --> 01:10:22,509
but we'd rather
tend to a human shrub,

791
01:10:22,609 --> 01:10:24,431
if he were only worth it.

792
01:10:25,105 --> 01:10:28,269
Sadly, you're not worth it.

793
01:10:31,057 --> 01:10:32,618
Farewell, sir.

794
01:10:33,809 --> 01:10:35,881
We will never meet again.

795
01:10:38,385 --> 01:10:41,069
I'm not ashamed to admit I regret it.

796
01:10:46,577 --> 01:10:48,966
I feel like that Victor Hugo character.

797
01:10:49,073 --> 01:10:53,034
""I am alone, a widower,
and evening is upon me.''

798
01:11:58,673 --> 01:12:00,942
Those orchids really
need to be fastened

799
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:03,088
or they'll fall out.

800
01:12:03,921 --> 01:12:07,085
Like that.
By tucking them in myself.

801
01:12:09,425 --> 01:12:11,629
Truly, I'm not being offensive?

802
01:12:15,697 --> 01:12:17,421
What if I smelled them?

803
01:12:23,729 --> 01:12:25,551
I don't know the scent.

804
01:12:55,889 --> 01:12:57,645
Why did you wait so long?

805
01:13:04,913 --> 01:13:08,394
For fear of suffering.

806
01:13:29,329 --> 01:13:30,572
Stop.

807
01:13:33,393 --> 01:13:34,440
Go on.

808
01:14:57,681 --> 01:14:59,470
You don't have to come out.

809
01:15:00,145 --> 01:15:02,862
I was passing by.
I saw the light.

810
01:15:02,961 --> 01:15:05,328
I thought you might be ill.

811
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,512
Who is it?

812
01:15:16,944 --> 01:15:18,668
Please forgive me.

813
01:17:22,897 --> 01:17:26,858
I was almost asleep.
This late it could only be you.

814
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:28,521
I thought you wouldn't come.

815
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:42,700
You're so pale. Are you ill?

816
01:17:47,153 --> 01:17:48,975
I'm sorry I woke you up.

817
01:17:53,521 --> 01:17:55,244
- I'll leave.
- Don't.

818
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,662
I forbid it.

819
01:18:10,993 --> 01:18:12,335
Come.

820
01:18:15,152 --> 01:18:16,908
Wait. I brought you something.

821
01:18:52,529 --> 01:18:54,416
Sit down.

822
01:19:23,568 --> 01:19:26,350
If you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

823
01:19:29,744 --> 01:19:31,151
But I do.

824
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:34,030
I like it very much.

825
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:20,009
I feel I've disturbed so many things.

826
01:20:27,344 --> 01:20:28,751
Poor darling.

827
01:20:29,937 --> 01:20:31,497
I shouldn't have come.

828
01:20:32,273 --> 01:20:34,029
Charles, you're mad.

829
01:20:35,568 --> 01:20:37,423
You never disturb me.

830
01:20:39,025 --> 01:20:40,912
What do you want me to do?

831
01:20:42,544 --> 01:20:44,715
Play our sonata?

832
01:21:41,008 --> 01:21:42,569
I play badly.

833
01:21:47,888 --> 01:21:49,776
You look so sad.

834
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,644
Play some more.

835
01:22:13,456 --> 01:22:15,693
Should I play or be tender?

836
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,457
""Orchids''?

837
01:23:07,952 --> 01:23:09,675
What are you thinking of?

838
01:23:10,865 --> 01:23:12,687
What's going on in that head?

839
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,302
A fine thing.

840
01:23:15,408 --> 01:23:17,351
I'm becoming neurotic.

841
01:23:19,184 --> 01:23:20,875
I hear voices.

842
01:23:32,368 --> 01:23:34,408
Maybe it's because there are voices.

843
01:24:57,104 --> 01:24:58,664
I'm leaving.

844
01:25:01,104 --> 01:25:03,788
You're impossible!
It's hopeless!

845
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,040
If only I could put some sense
into that head.

846
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:43,241
You can, if you want to.

847
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,596
Remember my friend Ernestine?

848
01:26:32,336 --> 01:26:33,896
Yes, you do.

849
01:26:34,896 --> 01:26:36,457
A tall brunette.

850
01:26:46,736 --> 01:26:50,281
You met her at the races.

851
01:26:50,384 --> 01:26:51,944
What about her?

852
01:26:52,912 --> 01:26:54,985
Her beau is going to marry her.

853
01:26:59,344 --> 01:27:01,548
And he's highly respectable.

854
01:27:03,601 --> 01:27:05,161
Isn't that nice?

855
01:27:13,680 --> 01:27:16,909
To do that for a woman

856
01:27:18,672 --> 01:27:21,355
who gave him
the best years of her life?

857
01:27:25,232 --> 01:27:28,396
I don't say it's wrong.
We each do as we please.

858
01:27:58,256 --> 01:28:00,623
You'll leave me someday.

859
01:28:04,016 --> 01:28:05,577
I know it.

860
01:28:12,304 --> 01:28:14,726
Men are capable of anything.

861
01:29:13,807 --> 01:29:15,782
Good morning, sir.

862
01:29:34,927 --> 01:29:36,488
A cup of coffee?

863
01:29:37,584 --> 01:29:38,991
No, thanks.

864
01:29:41,808 --> 01:29:43,466
You look relaxed.

865
01:29:44,784 --> 01:29:47,020
I can't say the same for you.

866
01:29:55,056 --> 01:29:57,576
It's time I got down to work.

867
01:30:00,304 --> 01:30:02,344
If it isn't already too late.

868
01:30:03,184 --> 01:30:04,972
Sir, the barber is here.

869
01:30:05,072 --> 01:30:06,795
Show him in.

870
01:30:16,624 --> 01:30:18,795
When I woke up this morning,

871
01:30:20,112 --> 01:30:22,795
I knew I was free of Odette.

872
01:30:25,392 --> 01:30:29,669
Now even her face
is fading from my mind.

873
01:30:30,863 --> 01:30:32,751
Her pale complexion,

874
01:30:34,224 --> 01:30:36,526
her high cheekbones.

875
01:30:42,256 --> 01:30:45,420
Maybe she loved me
more than I thought.

876
01:30:49,072 --> 01:30:51,276
She also cheated on you more.

877
01:30:55,984 --> 01:30:57,544
Good morning, sir.

878
01:31:09,519 --> 01:31:13,480
She's going to Egypt
with Forcheville and the Verdurins.

879
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,622
Are you paying for her trip?

880
01:31:17,264 --> 01:31:18,344
Yes.

881
01:31:48,879 --> 01:31:51,563
To think that I wasted years of my life...

882
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:55,247
that I wanted to die...

883
01:31:57,072 --> 01:31:59,014
that the love of my life...

884
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:03,688
was a woman I didn't like...

885
01:32:04,976 --> 01:32:06,983
who wasn't my type.

886
01:32:11,696 --> 01:32:13,583
When are you going to marry her?

887
01:33:36,336 --> 01:33:38,059
What a pleasant surprise.

888
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:40,527
My daughter's waiting.
I can't stay.

889
01:33:40,624 --> 01:33:42,184
Sit down.

890
01:33:43,248 --> 01:33:45,615
The missus will be ready in a moment.

891
01:33:45,712 --> 01:33:47,621
We're dining with the archduchess.

892
01:33:49,456 --> 01:33:55,053
I've brought Oriane some photographs
of the Knights of Rhodes.

893
01:33:57,071 --> 01:33:59,275
They're downstairs.

894
01:34:06,352 --> 01:34:09,199
How nice of you to drop in
on your old friend.

895
01:34:12,496 --> 01:34:14,568
Everything about you is perfect --

896
01:34:15,247 --> 01:34:20,648
what you wear, what you say,
what you read, what you do.

897
01:34:25,007 --> 01:34:26,895
- Do you like my dress?
- Of course.

898
01:34:26,992 --> 01:34:28,552
I'm delighted.

899
01:34:30,927 --> 01:34:32,967
Who will be at the archduchess's?

900
01:34:33,072 --> 01:34:35,887
The usual crowd.
It'll be deadly dull.

901
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:39,462
There's a last-minute guest.
King Theodose's brother.

902
01:34:39,567 --> 01:34:41,323
My God, more royalty.

903
01:34:41,423 --> 01:34:44,238
Dining out is such a bore.

904
01:34:45,904 --> 01:34:48,587
Bazin and I are going
to Italy next spring.

905
01:34:49,263 --> 01:34:51,784
If you came,
it would make our trip.

906
01:34:51,887 --> 01:34:55,051
I hear you know of things
no one else ever gets to see.

907
01:34:56,175 --> 01:34:57,736
Here they are.

908
01:34:59,311 --> 01:35:01,221
Not tonight, Oriane.

909
01:35:01,327 --> 01:35:04,491
- Let me see them.
- Your carriage is ready, sir.

910
01:35:05,167 --> 01:35:07,982
Come on. Time to trot.

911
01:35:13,488 --> 01:35:16,171
Will you tell me
whether you're coming to Italy with us?

912
01:35:17,520 --> 01:35:19,789
I really don't think that's possible.

913
01:35:20,464 --> 01:35:23,879
How can you know that
10 months ahead of time?

914
01:35:25,776 --> 01:35:27,532
I'll tell you if you insist,

915
01:35:28,207 --> 01:35:32,004
but can't you see that I'm very ill?

916
01:35:33,423 --> 01:35:37,035
Yes. You don't look well at all.

917
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:39,945
But 10 months
is time enough to get better.

918
01:35:40,047 --> 01:35:41,673
Madame, his grace is waiting for you.

919
01:35:44,464 --> 01:35:47,780
In a word,
what prevents you from coming?

920
01:35:49,264 --> 01:35:50,824
My dear friend,

921
01:35:52,111 --> 01:35:54,282
I'll be dead by then.

922
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:58,894
The doctors give me
three or four months to live

923
01:35:58,991 --> 01:36:00,552
at the most.

924
01:36:02,512 --> 01:36:05,098
You're joking. What is this?

925
01:36:06,352 --> 01:36:08,327
It's hardly my idea of a joke.

926
01:36:15,823 --> 01:36:18,376
I've never told you of my illness.

927
01:36:18,480 --> 01:36:23,237
But since you asked,
I may die any day now.

928
01:36:25,488 --> 01:36:27,943
But I mustn't keep you.
You're dining out.

929
01:36:28,047 --> 01:36:31,659
Don't worry about the dinner.
It doesn't matter.

930
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:35,305
Stop mooning over Swann.
Your horses are waiting.

931
01:36:35,983 --> 01:36:38,471
Excuse me, Charles.
We have a long way to go.

932
01:36:38,576 --> 01:36:40,266
Think nothing of it.

933
01:36:42,864 --> 01:36:45,002
I don't believe a word
of what you say.

934
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:47,625
Let's discuss it.

935
01:36:48,303 --> 01:36:49,896
Come to lunch.

936
01:36:50,575 --> 01:36:52,746
Any day you like.

937
01:36:52,847 --> 01:36:54,254
Oriane, you're a disgrace.

938
01:36:54,352 --> 01:36:57,101
You've left your black shoes on
with a red dress.

939
01:36:57,199 --> 01:36:59,403
Hurry back up and put on red shoes.

940
01:36:59,504 --> 01:37:02,221
- I thought we were late.
- Not at all.

941
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,262
Don't worry. They'll wait.

942
01:37:04,367 --> 01:37:06,309
You can't wear black shoes.

943
01:37:06,416 --> 01:37:08,936
Tell a maid to bring down
your red ones.

944
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,661
What would women do
without a husband?

945
01:37:14,767 --> 01:37:16,654
I saved her from black shoes.

946
01:37:16,751 --> 01:37:19,980
I didn't think they looked bad.

947
01:37:20,079 --> 01:37:21,323
You may be right.

948
01:37:21,424 --> 01:37:23,944
But as soon as we'd gotten there,
she would have noticed

949
01:37:24,048 --> 01:37:25,771
and sent me home to get her shoes.

950
01:37:25,872 --> 01:37:29,669
Listen, please step aside,
or she'll start talking again.

951
01:37:29,775 --> 01:37:32,197
I must tell you, I'm starving.

952
01:37:32,303 --> 01:37:35,172
I had a rotten lunch,
despite a superb bearnaise sauce,

953
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:38,629
and I can't wait
to sit down for dinner.

954
01:37:48,079 --> 01:37:50,283
Papa, aren't you going to
introduce me to your friends?

955
01:37:51,247 --> 01:37:53,189
It's not the right time.

956
01:37:53,295 --> 01:37:56,557
Pay no attention
to those damn doctors.

957
01:37:57,071 --> 01:37:59,941
You're as fit as a fiddle.
You'll bury us all.

958
01:38:00,975 --> 01:38:04,107
I'm so sad Charles is ill.

959
01:38:05,103 --> 01:38:08,748
But even so, that doesn't mean
I can entertain his wife and daughter.

960
01:38:08,847 --> 01:38:10,440
Next thing, my coachman will say,

961
01:38:10,544 --> 01:38:13,359
""My daughter is ill.
Take me to meet the Princess of Parma.''

962
01:38:44,655 --> 01:38:46,215
Let's go.

963
01:38:52,047 --> 01:38:53,935
We'll come back

964
01:38:54,031 --> 01:38:55,755
some other time.

965
01:39:17,807 --> 01:39:20,393
How can people admire
these automobiles?

966
01:39:20,495 --> 01:39:22,350
Vulgarity and madness have taken over.

967
01:39:22,447 --> 01:39:24,814
- It's in fashion.
- Does this suit me?

968
01:39:24,912 --> 01:39:26,537
Look at those hats.

969
01:39:27,631 --> 01:39:29,671
They look like birdcages.

970
01:39:31,792 --> 01:39:34,574
When I think of
the women we've known,

971
01:39:34,672 --> 01:39:36,646
my poor Charles.

972
01:39:46,127 --> 01:39:47,688
Good day, sir.

973
01:39:48,912 --> 01:39:50,472
Your daughter, isn't it?

974
01:39:52,144 --> 01:39:53,704
Yes, Meme.

975
01:39:56,687 --> 01:39:58,280
I forgot to ask.

976
01:39:59,599 --> 01:40:02,599
How's your struggle
with the grim reaper?

977
01:40:03,951 --> 01:40:07,748
The memory of love
helps me face death without fear.

978
01:40:09,487 --> 01:40:11,047
Death.

979
01:40:11,727 --> 01:40:13,866
The word death is a generalization.

980
01:40:13,967 --> 01:40:16,334
There are as many deaths
as there are people.

981
01:40:18,127 --> 01:40:21,061
Yours won't be like mine.

982
01:40:25,455 --> 01:40:27,178
Losing one's life, Charles...

983
01:40:28,623 --> 01:40:31,471
the only life we'll ever have.

984
01:40:34,192 --> 01:40:36,777
What have I done with mine?

985
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:52,974
Life is like an artist's studio,

986
01:40:53,807 --> 01:40:55,694
full of half-finished sketches.

987
01:40:58,863 --> 01:41:01,230
We sacrifice everything to fantasies

988
01:41:02,607 --> 01:41:05,923
that vanish, one after another.

989
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:12,068
We betray our ambitions,

990
01:41:12,815 --> 01:41:14,059
our dreams.

991
01:41:15,535 --> 01:41:16,942
Our friends?

992
01:41:21,263 --> 01:41:23,435
Friendship isn't much,

993
01:41:24,271 --> 01:41:27,587
but those who scorn it
can be the best of friends.

994
01:41:35,823 --> 01:41:37,612
I loved life.

995
01:41:38,319 --> 01:41:40,107
I loved the arts.

996
01:41:43,023 --> 01:41:48,260
Now I treasure
all those old feelings.

997
01:41:51,151 --> 01:41:53,093
They're like a collection.

998
01:41:55,055 --> 01:41:59,332
I open up my own heart
as if it were a display cabinet.

999
01:42:01,039 --> 01:42:03,756
One by one,
I look over all my loves...

1000
01:42:06,255 --> 01:42:08,491
loves that others never had.

1001
01:42:10,511 --> 01:42:12,104
I tell myself...

1002
01:42:13,743 --> 01:42:15,947
it'll be sad to leave
all of that behind.

1003
01:42:23,376 --> 01:42:25,677
Here's Madame Swann.

1004
01:42:56,335 --> 01:42:58,506
Do you know her?
It's Madame Swann.

1005
01:42:58,607 --> 01:43:00,614
Ever heard of Odette de Crecy?

1006
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,233
Odette de Crecy?
Yes. Those sad eyes.

1007
01:43:05,872 --> 01:43:07,432
She's Madame Swann now.

1008
01:43:07,535 --> 01:43:09,510
She must be getting on in years.

1009
01:43:09,615 --> 01:43:11,502
I made love to her ages ago.

1010
01:43:11,599 --> 01:43:13,933
The day President Mac-Mahon resigned.

1011
01:43:14,031 --> 01:43:15,918
It was 500 francs a shot.
