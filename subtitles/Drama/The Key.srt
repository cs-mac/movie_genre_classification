1
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,589
Say, can you tell me,

2
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,472
where Commander
Wadlow's office is?

3
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,717
Has... er... has America
come into the war?

4
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,275
I don't know.
All I asked was-

5
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,233
Yeah, yeah, I heard you,
Captain. Just over there.

6
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,555
Thanks.

7
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,796
You going to drive
a tug for us, captain?

8
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,677
Commander Wadlow?
In there, sir.

9
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,835
Thank you.

10
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,996
- Yes?
- Ross.

11
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,228
Oh, yes, of course, Commander Ross.
We've been expecting you.

12
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,079
My name's Wadlow.
You couldn't have come at a better time.

13
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:42,271
You know the type of thing,
of course?

14
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,435
Not exactly.

15
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,710
Well, sorry, but as you volunteered,
I should've thought...

16
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,990
I didn't exactly volunteer.

17
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,952
I'm a sergeant in the Canadian Army.

18
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,277
All I know is, they gave me this
uniform and told me to report here today.

19
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,472
I see. But you have commanded
ocean-going tugs?

20
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,355
Not for 10 years.
I think that's why they picked me.

21
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,432
No doubt.
No doubt.

22
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,838
Well, you might call this enterprise
the Red Cross of the ocean.

23
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,190
You're in the rescue business now.

24
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,868
If some lonely, unhappy
cargo ship gets torpedoed

25
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,389
or can't keep up with its convoy,

26
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,831
you pop out onto the briny deep
and bring your lame duck in.

27
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,632
And everybody aboard's
ever so grateful.

28
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,068
That's all there is
to it really.

29
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,748
Sounds simple.
Now I know why they picked me.

30
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,190
We're getting so much business
from the States these days,

31
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,789
that we have two full crews
and two captains for each tug.

32
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,072
You relieve each other, see?
Your ship's the W-88.

33
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,238
Actually, she's in dry dock for repairs
at the moment, so you can take it easy

34
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,032
for the next few days.
I see.

35
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,195
I'm here!

36
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,914
Let's have the vulgar details
and I'll run along.

37
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,599
Excuse me, will you?

38
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,958
Nice of you
to drop by, captain.

39
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,549
You've got a Dane
with a cargo of high explosives

40
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,716
and a torpedo
in number one hold.

41
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,472
Sounds dull. Besides, it'll
take eight days there and back.

42
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,318
I don't think
I'll go this time.

43
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,472
You!
I think so!

44
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,999
Ha!

45
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,952
Amigo! Ha-ha!

46
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,159
Hey, just a moment,
just a moment.

47
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,351
What exactly are you
doing here, anyway?

48
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,073
Don't tell me you've
taken Walter's place?

49
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,759
- I don't know, I-
- Oh, no.

50
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,190
No, you can't do that
to him. He's a nice man.

51
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,994
Don't tell me you've fallen for that
nonsense about the Red Cross of the ocean?

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,714
Just what are you
doing here, anyway?

53
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Now you'll never believe me-
Couldn't wait for America to come in?

54
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,874
You're an idiot!

55
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,593
Get out of it, man!
Get out of it!

56
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,268
I'm sure your lame duck
must be getting impatient by now.

57
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,199
And we don't want all that nice
imported gunpowder getting damp, do we?

58
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,674
Goodbye, Captain Ford.
I'm going.

59
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,270
Good. What about going out
right now with Captain Ford?

60
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,597
Actually, if you watch him closely, then do
exactly the opposite, you'll have it all down pat.

61
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,510
Ha-ha! Yes, David, come with me and after you've seen
what it's like, you can come back and tell him to...

62
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,676
Sir, SOS from W-40.
Where?

63
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,553
I don't know. She broke off.
Well, call her.

64
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,749
Who's on her?

65
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,915
Raymond.

66
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,709
Get me air-sea rescue.

67
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,753
Yes, do. Just another day in
the Red Cross of the ocean.

68
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,915
Come on, idiot!

69
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,555
Hello?

70
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,870
Yes, one of our tugs,
I'm afraid. W-40.

71
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,877
Its last known position
was 50 north, 30 west.

72
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,352
What would you say
hit that tug?

73
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,597
- A dive-bomber, a U-boat. Who knows?
- U- boat, most likely.

74
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,870
- You run into many?
- Oh, yes.

75
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,231
Not the ones who lay the ducks low,
they usually keep going after the convoy.

76
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,396
But Jerry's got a lot of mine-laying
subs in the neighbourhood.

77
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,239
Once they smell blood, they
come after us like vultures.

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,589
They call this
U- boat alley, my boy.

79
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,473
But once we reach the dock, we'll
be all right because she's got guns.

80
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,954
She's got guns?

81
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,639
Don't we have guns?

82
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,990
Just what sort of a navy
do you think we've got here?

83
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,155
What's the story?

84
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,396
We've got a Danska with a
cigar in number one hold,

85
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,589
and a load
of high explosives.

86
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,472
- That's nice.
- This is Captain Ross.

87
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,069
He's taking over W-88.
My mate.

88
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,235
We've met.

89
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,879
Square up that tow rope!

90
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,035
Aye-aye, sir.

91
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,076
All coming back to you
in dribs and drabs?

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,315
Like I'd never been away.

93
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,272
- Clear that filthy deck!
- Aye-aye, sir!

94
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,118
What is that?

95
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,357
You asked about guns. Don't go too
near her, she's on a hair trigger.

96
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,949
- Yes, but what is it?
- This is our gun.

97
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,752
But they're not all like this?

98
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,918
This is a single-barrel
Pom-Pom, 1926.

99
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,156
'26 was a vintage year
for Pom-Poms.

100
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,595
Don't worry, chum.

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:03,036
The ducks are all armed now and their
stuff's heavier than the U-boats.

102
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,196
Jerry won't surface anyway
within the duck's range.

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,868
So, once we reach her,
we're safe as houses.

104
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,310
Yes, I've seen
some of your houses.

105
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,160
- Nice pigsty you've got here.
- Thank you.

106
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,873
All ready when you are, skipper.

107
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,071
- Everyone here?
- All but Ibbetson.

108
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,071
This time he's
really in trouble.

109
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,714
All right, get going.
Right, sir.

110
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,798
Is the gentleman
staying aboard, sir?

111
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,315
I think so.

112
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,635
All right.

113
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,119
What's the matter with him?

114
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,436
Oh, nothing.
He's just tired.

115
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,509
Port a little.

116
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,914
Port a little, sir!

117
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,550
Chris, have you ever had a duck blow up
on you while you were coming alongside?

118
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,117
No. But we do lose a few tugs
that way from time to time.

119
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,550
Thanks for
asking me along.

120
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,988
Watch your step here.

121
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,555
I don't want to have to put
a boat over the side for you.

122
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,992
All right, lads. Couple up!

123
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,755
Signal, sir.

124
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,556
Message from the duck?
Not likely.

125
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,354
That's the one thing they
mustn't do, break radio silence.

126
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,120
That's the most important
item in envelope "D".

127
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,596
Envelope "D" is a sealed instruction
they get when they leave harbour.

128
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,836
What to do when unable
to keep up with your convoy.

129
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,995
Such as?

130
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,430
Skipper flashes a code signal
to his group leader,

131
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,518
puts out his fires if he has any,

132
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,359
keeps radio silence so as
not to give the position away,

133
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,790
and just tries to be patient
till we come and get him.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:05,955
That's about it.

135
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,917
What happens
if we get torpedoed too?

136
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,680
Oh, no. We never get torpedoed.

137
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,077
Jerry's not going to waste any
torpedoes on us. We're too small.

138
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,238
Besides, their mine-laying
subs don't carry torpedoes.

139
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,157
Why didn't you tell me that
in the first place?

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,399
Because they've got a deck gun that's big
enough to blow us clean out of the water.

141
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,999
Any other questions?

142
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,675
You all right?

143
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:49,795
Yeah, sure.

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,797
You've been away
a long time.

145
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,797
If you don't feel well,
why don't you go lie down?

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,638
Don't be embarrassed, old boy.

147
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,795
I'm all right.

148
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,110
It's getting a bit cramped up here.
I think I'll go and stretch my legs.

149
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,115
Thanks.

150
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,189
Give it to the skipper.

151
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,074
I'm sorry. Take mine.

152
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,474
No, no. Never mind.

153
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,269
Junkers diving fast!

154
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,959
Action stations!

155
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,789
Green one!

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,479
Green one, sir!

157
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,715
Fire!

158
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,833
It won't be long now.

159
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,472
Here, get used to it.

160
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,910
She's got herself a very nice fire.

161
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,990
Think she can last?
Who knows?

162
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,430
But we'll be inside her range
in a mile or two.

163
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,949
I just hope her guns
haven't been damaged.

164
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,031
- Starboard 20!
- 20 starboard, sir!

165
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,116
Well, it's his turn to run now.

166
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,959
I'd like to get one. Just once.

167
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,753
Now all we've got to do
is to bring that mess in.

168
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,152
Steady on, there!

169
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,149
Get the line-gun ready!

170
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:11,035
- Line-gun ready!
- Line-gun ready, sir!

171
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,198
- Don't fire till I tell you!
- Aye-aye, sir!

172
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,395
Fire!

173
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,668
Be as quick as you can
with the connecting up!

174
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,718
I prefer to connect
to your anchor cable!

175
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,480
When I've connected up
the main throw...

176
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,235
Watch the lines from your wires!

177
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,315
Smoke, Kane?

178
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,555
No.

179
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,629
Well, home and dry.

180
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,837
This time, anyway.

181
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,076
My knees are like jelly.

182
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,474
What's the matter?

183
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,353
It always hits me
like this after it's over.

184
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,279
Right now, my stomach's
doing a Morris dance.

185
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,870
If I get home before I'm sick,
I'll be all right. How do you feel?

186
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,479
Fine.

187
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,796
- Big man, eh?
- You wait.

188
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,877
Come on,
let's have some coffee.

189
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,714
Don't thank me, commander.
It's all in a day's work.

190
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,150
What did you think of
it all, Commander Ross?

191
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,315
Very interesting.

192
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,114
Good. Then you'll be glad to hear
that your ship's out of dry dock now.

193
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,788
Perhaps you'll go along and see it
tomorrow and meet your opposite number,

194
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,752
- Captain Van Dam.
- Sure.

195
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,315
Aren't you in the least
a little bit ashamed?

196
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,351
Just a moment,
gentlemen.

197
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,073
You've forgotten
your little pink pills.

198
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,919
Oh, here. Get yourself
a good night's sleep.

199
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,599
- I don't use them.
- You will.

200
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,472
Meanwhile, you can sell
them anywhere in town.

201
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,911
That reminds me, Commander. We've
got you billeted at the Grand Hotel.

202
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,429
Come now, not the
Black Hole of Calcutta?

203
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,631
That's no way
to treat an ally.

204
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,876
Come home and have
breakfast with me, anyway.

205
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,955
Where do you live?

206
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:22,152
I've got an apartment. Two
rooms and a bath. Best in town.

207
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,315
Naturally.

208
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,112
Captain Ford.
Yeah?

209
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,753
I want to thank you
for saving my ship.

210
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,474
Not at all.
Better luck next time.

211
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,558
Look, all you have to
do now is go in here,

212
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,557
fill yourself up
one little old report,

213
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,876
and you can go out and get
as plastered as you like.

214
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,435
- Thank you.
- Not at all. Bye.

215
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,952
Hello, my fairy
godmother!

216
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,196
- Oh, it's you, is it?
- Well, that's something.

217
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,675
She worries about me, poor
dear, every time I go out.

218
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,835
I owe her money.

219
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,353
Fill her up,
there's a good girl.

220
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,437
- You haven't paid for the last lot.
- Yes, I know.

221
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,995
And you owe me for last
week's newspapers too.

222
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,430
Tomorrow. All claims
settled in full tomorrow.

223
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,039
Have you got a cigarette, love?

224
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,195
Yes, love.

225
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,676
Come to think of it, you're the
first guest I've ever had here.

226
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,313
I'm not surprised.

227
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,592
How did you get
a place like this?

228
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,268
That's not all I've got.
Where are you?

229
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,233
- Oh, Chris!
- Darling.

230
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,595
How did it go?

231
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,109
Easy. A Dane on fire.
He behaved very well.

232
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,878
Have you been all right?

233
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,513
Why didn't you tell me
you were going?

234
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,553
Because you look
so pretty when you sleep.

235
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,478
Oh, this is Stella.

236
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,271
This is my old American
friend, David Ross.

237
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,233
You've heard of lend-lease. They
meant him. He's finally arrived.

238
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,759
- Hello.
- Hello.

239
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,633
Tell her how I pulled you
out of the Panama Canal that time.

240
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,796
No, but I'll tell her
how I pulled you out.

241
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,479
Yes, of course.
After you threw me in!

242
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,238
You took advantage
of a drunken man.

243
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,874
Sit down. I'm going
to wash. Then you wash.

244
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,550
And then we'll all have the best baked beans
on toast in the whole uncivilised worid!

245
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:26,479
Please sit down, captain.

246
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,635
Thank you.

247
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,675
It's nice here.

248
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,315
Yes.

249
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,952
- Are you on tug boats, too, captain?
- Yes.

250
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,277
I haven't started yet, really.

251
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,829
As a matter of fact, I haven't
been on one for ten years.

252
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,193
Until this trip.

253
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,469
You were out with Chris?

254
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,115
Yes.

255
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,955
You'll be very good.

256
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,755
I hope so.

257
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,230
Do you know Chris a long time?

258
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,112
I beg your pardon?

259
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,675
Have you known Chris a long time?

260
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,871
Oh, we used to run
into each other a lot,

261
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,991
when the worid
was young and gay.

262
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:32,070
- He's a very nice man.
- Yes.

263
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,353
What did he mean when he
said you were lend-lease?

264
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,073
I don't know.

265
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,316
I guess I'm an over-aged destroyer.

266
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,475
Hm?

267
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,717
I'm afraid I was in too much of a
hurry when I picked this jacket out.

268
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:47,989
It's tight under the arms.

269
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,556
Take it off, be comfortable.
No, it's all right.

270
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,235
Let me see it.

271
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,793
- Come on, take it off.
- No, no, really.

272
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,956
Take it off.
I can alter it for you.

273
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,435
I think I can help you.
Come with me.

274
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,473
Here. Put this on.

275
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,715
What's going on?

276
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,196
His jacket is too tight.
I'm trying to find him another one.

277
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,115
Does it fit?

278
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,275
Yes.

279
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,233
Don't say it does, if it
doesn't. Try the arm holes.

280
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,192
- Hm?
- Yes, it's fine.

281
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,594
Good. Give it to me.

282
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,955
Oh, the toast.

283
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,038
- Sh! Sh!
- Chris, I'm sorry.

284
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,389
I'll tell you about it later.

285
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,353
Go on, take a bath. You won't
care for the tub at the hotel.

286
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,835
I'm sorry.

287
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,239
I was just thinking, you're going to
look over your ship tomorrow, aren't you?

288
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,874
Well, the very best of luck
with old Van Dam.

289
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,639
- Van Dam?
- Hm.

290
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,558
Oh, yes,
the other skipper.

291
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,396
- What's wrong with him?
- Oh, nothing, nothing.

292
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,478
Don't be silly, Chris.
Van Dam is a very fine man.

293
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:55,911
Oh, he's a very good boy.
He owns W-88, by the way.

294
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,554
He sneaked her out of Holland from
under the nose of the whole German navy,

295
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,557
and he brought her over here
practically single-handed.

296
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,990
- It's just that...
- Oh, you'll find out.

297
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,633
You're a very funny man.

298
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,790
Don't worry, you'll be all right.
The first time is the worst.

299
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,752
I'm all right. I...
I'm tired, I guess.

300
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,511
Will you take your
sleeping pills now?

301
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:41,078
No, no pills. I'm taking David on
the town. We've got to celebrate.

302
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,235
You're going out?

303
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,271
Yes, it's reunion time!

304
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,471
I haven't thrown him
in any canals lately.

305
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,635
All right.

306
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,872
Don't keep him out too
long, please. He must sleep.

307
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,356
If he doesn't, he'll go to pieces
again if he has to sail tomorrow.

308
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,954
What do you mean, "go to pieces"?
I've never gone to pieces!

309
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,434
Don't mix me up with someone else!

310
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:05,635
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,917
All right, I'll be home early.

312
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,475
I'll get ready.

313
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,517
I won't keep him out too late.

314
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,952
- Thank you.
- He must sleep.

315
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,635
Finished.

316
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,076
It looks very nice.

317
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,875
Yes, it... feels better all the
way around. Thank you very much.

318
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,832
Okay?
Yeah, ready.

319
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,317
Goodbye. And thanks for
the meal, I enjoyed it.

320
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,636
You're welcome.
You must come again.

321
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,435
Thank you.

322
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,437
Chris?
Eh?

323
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,515
What...?

324
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,878
Don't drink too much.

325
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,036
No, my love, no!

326
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,069
What do you think of Stella?
Can't hear you.

327
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,840
What do you think of Stella?

328
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,110
You're lucky.
Yes, I am.

329
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,472
You're wondering
about this, aren't you?

330
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,671
Whatever you think,
you're wrong.

331
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,029
I wasn't thinking anything.

332
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,994
You listen to me, because I want you to
know. I want you to know about Stella.

333
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,514
She was going to marry a
tug driver named Westerby.

334
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,199
Philip Westerby.

335
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,675
I knew him. Not too well.

336
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,997
Anyway, he got his
the day before the wedding.

337
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,919
A chum of mine, Hal Van Barger...

338
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,758
That's his jacket
you're wearing, I think.

339
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:37,554
He heard about the flat going
and he hopped up and got it.

340
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,035
Things were worse then
than they are now.

341
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,231
People were actually
sleeping in the gutters.

342
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,715
Anyway, she stayed on
with Van Barger.

343
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,990
Don't ask me why,
I don't know.

344
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,956
Maybe because he was
a tug man, too, like Westerby.

345
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,671
Maybe because she could tell he was
just about to crack, which he was.

346
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:03,309
Maybe she just didn't have anywhere
else to go and didn't much care.

347
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,953
I don't know and I don't care.

348
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,868
Anyway, Van Barger gave
me the key to the flat.

349
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,116
He said if anything happened
to him, he wanted me to have it.

350
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,518
He said we poor sinners on the tugs
deserved a few breaks along the way,

351
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,950
and we ought to keep
the flat in the family.

352
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,639
I know what you're thinking,
but you're wrong!

353
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,558
- I wasn't thinking anything.
- Yes, you were.

354
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,479
I think it's fine.
How do you know?

355
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,829
How could you?

356
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,150
You don't know what it's like to have
someone like that waiting for you on shore,

357
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,554
waiting for you
to come home.

358
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,751
What happened
to Van Barger?

359
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,997
Oh, he went out
to pick up a Greek...

360
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,032
When he got there, the
Greek wasn't there anymore.

361
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,117
But a U-boat was.

362
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,034
Ah, look at this.

363
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,119
Time to refuel!

364
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,833
You'll be quiet when you go in
to get your suitcase, won't you?

365
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,155
Okay.

366
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,510
You couldn't just drop it
down to me, could you?

367
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,198
Let's just have one for the road.

368
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:42,517
Good job we did get home early. We
might have to go out again tomorrow.

369
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,752
- Idiot.
- Hm...

370
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,555
Here.

371
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:57,597
Here, take this.

372
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,433
Put it away somewhere
and forget about it.

373
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,948
I don't want it.

374
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,116
- Take it!
- No! No!

375
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,992
When Van Barger gave me a key,

376
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,397
he made me promise to have another
made just as soon as I ever used it,

377
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,397
and to give it
to someone on the tugs.

378
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,239
But I didn't know who to give
it to. I want you to have it.

379
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,317
And I said I didn't want it.

380
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,918
- Here, you take it.
- Keep it.

381
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,953
You have to keep it, because I have
to keep my promise to Van Barger.

382
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,513
Give it to somebody else.

383
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,508
Make me a promise right now, that the
moment you use it, if you ever have to,

384
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,792
that you'll get another one made
and you'll give it to someone.

385
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,310
Someone on the tugs, someone who's
all right, someone who needs it.

386
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,080
You know what I mean.
Then you make them promise.

387
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,232
Yes, but the war
may go on a long time.

388
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,431
- You're crazy.
- You'll outlive everybody.

389
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,312
Anyway, I don't want it.

390
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,116
You want me
to break your nose, huh?

391
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,349
- You promise?
- I promise.

392
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,435
And then if anything does happen to
me, you'll... you'll look after Stella?

393
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,713
- You'll see that she's all right?
- Nothing is gonna happen to you.

394
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,873
We'll drink to that,
because in my considered opinion,

395
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:21,119
none of us is going to come out
of this alive, including you.

396
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,195
Thanks.

397
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,396
I hope you know what time it is.

398
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,076
We don't want to wake Stella, do we?

399
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,833
You know something
funny, David?

400
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,749
Stella, she's... she's
wonderful, she's so good to me,

401
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,077
but... but sometimes I...

402
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,439
Here, hold this.

403
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,757
Sometimes I don't think
she knows which is which...

404
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,269
Philip, Hal Van Barger, me.

405
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,072
It's all mixed up.

406
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,759
It's confused.

407
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,599
Do you know
she called me Philip once?

408
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,074
I didn't say anything.

409
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,714
She couldn't have told by my
face, I'm sure, it's just...

410
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,708
It's as if we're all
the same man.

411
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,513
And I don't know
which one.

412
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,235
I don't know which one
and I don't care.

413
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,479
That's strange, isn't it?

414
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,834
Tell me something.

415
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,793
Why does she wear
that wedding ring?

416
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,639
- Yes.
- That's funny, isn't it?

417
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,995
Hm...

418
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,031
What do you think
you're doing?

419
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,832
I'm not dead yet,
you know!

420
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,195
Sorry.

421
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,075
Here.

422
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,435
Sh!

423
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,950
See? Home early.

424
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,555
Yes.

425
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,514
Stella...

426
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,875
Night.

427
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,516
But you must sleep, darling.

428
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:41,392
I'm not sleepy.
I want to talk.

429
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,472
I'm a captain, you know?
I say talk, everyone talks.

430
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,352
And I say we talk now.

431
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,555
Sit down, please.

432
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,992
What shall
we talk about?

433
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,469
Hm?

434
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,233
I'd better make you
some coffee.

435
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,995
No, no! No coffee!
I don't want any coffee.

436
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,115
Come on, come on.

437
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,195
Oh, Stella, you're very good to me.

438
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,355
I love you.

439
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,395
I wish you'd marry me.

440
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,035
You want to... marry me?

441
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,275
Please.

442
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,429
We're full up.

443
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,877
I'm supposed to be billeted
here. My name is Ross.

444
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,035
Ross?

445
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,715
Right.

446
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,912
You'll have to share a room,
we're cramped for space.

447
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,917
I know. Same in London.

448
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,473
You're in 77.

449
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,394
Canadian, are you?

450
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,032
An American, I think.

451
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,469
This way.

452
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,039
It does not work.

453
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,389
Er, this way.

454
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,672
You've a nice warm room
next door to the kitchen.

455
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,835
Good.

456
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,877
And you get a towel
all to yourself.

457
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,035
That's nice.

458
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,995
There you are, captain.

459
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,036
There's your bed
over there, up on top.

460
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,391
Do I get that
all to myself too?

461
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,639
- Killed himself last week.
- Who?

462
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,638
Captain Walters,
the man that had that bed.

463
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,831
He was a tug-boat
man like you.

464
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,316
Swallowed a whole box
of sleeping pills.

465
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,669
Long sleep, huh?

466
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,313
Anything else you want?

467
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,556
Yes, I'd like that towel
you were talking about.

468
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,513
Oh, one thing at a time.
I've only got two legs.

469
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,788
Here's your wash basin.

470
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,835
The lavatory's down the hall,
you know what I mean?

471
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,837
Yeah, thanks a lot. Here.

472
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,270
- Keep it.
- I don't need it.

473
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,155
I didn't ask for you.
All I want is peace.

474
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,758
That's good enough
for me too.

475
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,791
And you'll get it, captain.

476
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,468
You'll get it before
you know what hit you.

477
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,352
Read the casualty lists.

478
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,035
Hey!

479
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,475
You mind turning off
the light, captain?

480
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:25,795
I'm sorry.

481
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,635
Captain Van Dam?

482
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:46,430
- Yes?
- I'm Captain Ross.

483
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,154
I heard the ship was ready, so I
thought I'd come down and look her over.

484
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,954
Captain Ross, you've come
to look her over. Good, good.

485
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,038
She's the best ship on this
base, and she deserves care.

486
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,959
Some people here like to live
in a pigsty, but I do not.

487
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,914
So you will please be good enough to
tidy up your mess when you come off duty.

488
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:05,395
Yes, of course.
I'm glad we understand each other.

489
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,713
Made any sorties yet?

490
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,878
Sorties? Oh, yes, I've
been out with Captain Ford.

491
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,196
- Did you like it?
- Not very much.

492
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,355
Why not?

493
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,829
I'd like it better if we had
some decent guns.

494
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:20,555
Guns?

495
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,352
Why do you want guns?

496
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,632
I don't like the idea of being shot
at and not being able to shoot back.

497
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,592
It makes me nervous.

498
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,553
That is because you have
the wrong approach to this work.

499
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,074
Stretcher bearers on the battlefield
cannot shoot back either.

500
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,474
That's quite a thought.

501
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,150
My dear fellow, war has nothing
noble or sensible about it.

502
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,032
It's simply an epidemic
of madness.

503
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,993
And anyone who takes part in it
is a lunatic and a murderer.

504
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,599
There's a lot in what you say, captain,

505
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,519
but I don't think it would be of any
particular comfort if you happen to get hit.

506
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,790
There are many ways
to avoid being hit.

507
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,389
For example, when I hear
the first shell coming,

508
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,431
I very often turn away,

509
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,712
go full astern
and sail backwards.

510
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,876
That way, I make myself
a smaller target,

511
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,834
and at such a distance, it is difficult
to tell in which direction I'm going.

512
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,749
Then I change course, zigzag,
and if necessary, repeat.

513
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,439
And you've never been hit, captain?

514
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,355
Never.

515
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,552
Any particular reason for this
ship having been in dry dock?

516
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,320
Her superstructure was shot away,

517
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,910
but that was your predecessor's
contribution, Captain Walters.

518
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,712
Why do you think
he killed himself?

519
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,389
It was an accident.
He drank a great deal.

520
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,397
I don't think he knew
what he was doing.

521
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,477
I trust you're not
a drinking man.

522
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,595
Have you met your crew?
No, I had them called.

523
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,518
I thought I'd take her out
for a dry run today.

524
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,188
Then I will leave you to it.
She's very lively on the rudder.

525
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,278
You must remember to give her counter-wheel
the moment you start pulling her around.

526
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:45,435
Thanks.

527
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,596
Her engine's
absolutely first class,

528
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,075
but there is a choke
in bilge pump.

529
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,998
You might tell
your chief engineer.

530
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,235
Thank you.

531
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,953
Hansie, Hansie.

532
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,516
And we go for a walk now.

533
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,109
Sit, sit. This is yours now.

534
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,469
I'm all right, thanks.

535
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,272
Er, Captain...

536
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,516
we were talking
about being shelled.

537
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,715
Yes.

538
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,115
Only this...

539
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,553
in this work, one must learn
how to live with fear.

540
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,318
You mean,
you're afraid, too, sometimes.

541
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,275
Yes.

542
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,516
But I believe in God.

543
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:29,156
Let me tell you something.
There are two kinds of fear.

544
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,715
In the one,
no matter how great your terror,

545
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,512
you pray to God,

546
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,589
and then you struggle desperately,
even superhumanly, to survive.

547
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,473
With the other,
you are so frozen, so paralysed,

548
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,477
that you cannot move.

549
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,750
and accept the death blow
without a quiver,

550
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,598
almost with thanks.

551
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,079
That is the dangerous fear.

552
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:55,598
You see, my friend, there is only
one enemy who really matters:

553
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,950
the enemy within yourself.

554
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,596
And only one thing to fear:
self-betrayal.

555
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,148
And, forgive me, but you must
remember that your crew is afraid too.

556
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,510
So, for that reason
more than ever,

557
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,838
you must be both
their captain and their father.

558
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,156
If they respect you
and have faith in you,

559
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,148
they will still be afraid
but not so much.

560
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,149
And above all,
no drink,

561
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,115
and no bad women.

562
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,355
Drink will destroy
your judgement,

563
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:33,836
and that kind of woman
will bring you bad luck.

564
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,029
You see, my friend,

565
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,468
in times like these,

566
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,069
it is much harder to command
than to be commanded.

567
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,838
This isn't exactly
my first ship, captain.

568
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,838
Of course. Oh, here is your
crew. They're a good lot.

569
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,749
But like the others of this branch of
the service, sadly lacking in discipline.

570
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,393
Goodbye.
Goodbye.

571
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,474
Do you sing?
Sing?

572
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,592
Yes. We are lacking a baritone
for the church choir.

573
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,314
And we begin rehearsals
for Christmas next week.

574
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,669
I'm sorry, I don't sing.

575
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,916
Oh. Pity.

576
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,319
Good luck.

577
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,476
6-4, this one's fresh from school.

578
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,875
Always expect the worst
from life, my boy.

579
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,149
You won't be disappointed.

580
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,078
- What's wrong, chief?
- Your horoscope bad today?

581
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,469
Watch it! Watch it!

582
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,871
I'm the mate, sir. Weaver.
How do you do?

583
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,275
Mr Grogan, the chief engineer.
Aye, sir!

584
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,152
- The bo'sun, Mr Baker.
- Aye, sir.

585
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,669
Well, I'll give you
the complete list later, sir.

586
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,679
I want to see
just what this ship-

587
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,831
I want to see just what this
ship can do this afternoon,

588
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:53,600
so be prepared for
some lively manoeuvres.

589
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,438
That goes particularly
for you, chief.

590
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:56,629
Aye-aye, sir.

591
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,876
All right, let's get moving.

592
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,308
Make ready for sea, bo'sun.

593
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,238
Stand by, fore and aft!

594
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,671
Let go of everything, forward!

595
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,470
Hang on to
your after springs!

596
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,475
Slow astern.

597
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,715
Slow astern, sir.

598
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,109
Let's go, aft!

599
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,435
Half ahead.

600
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,595
Half ahead, sir.

601
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,471
I'm not convinced the Almighty intended for
tugs to be placed in the hands of Americans.

602
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,636
But we shall see
what we shall see.

603
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:28,435
Engine room.

604
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,790
Engine room, can you
give me a little more speed?

605
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,752
We're full speed now, sir.

606
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:35,030
Yes, I know, but I'd like
little more, please.

607
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:38,076
I can't answer for the boiler, sir.

608
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,076
Naturally, I'll take
the responsibility for that.

609
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,514
Aye-aye, sir.

610
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,675
More speed!

611
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,952
We've got a sporting gentleman
aboard. More speed, he wants!

612
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,395
Full astern.

613
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,435
Full astern, sir?
That's what I said.

614
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,595
Full astern.

615
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,189
Full astern?

616
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,152
I knew it!
He's run her onto some rocks!

617
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,555
I knew he was an amateur
the moment I saw him.

618
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:13,709
Full ahead.

619
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,275
Full ahead, sir.

620
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,756
From full astern to full ahead?

621
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,428
Playing games, is it?
Enjoy yourself!

622
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,798
The man's mad.

623
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,194
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

624
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,833
She's a bit lively
on the rudder.

625
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,349
You have to watch
the counter-wheel on the turns.

626
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,959
Engine room,
thank you very much.

627
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,196
You can take her down to
your normal cruising speed now.

628
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,109
Aye-aye, sir.

629
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,112
Handles very nicely.
Yes, thank you, sir.

630
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,719
We'll be going home.
You can take a fix.

631
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,875
Oh, right, sir.

632
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,358
28 years I've been at sea,

633
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:19,154
and never, ever
had a day like this one!

634
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,314
Oh, er...

635
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,833
There you are, sir.

636
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:27,519
Well, sir, you... er...

637
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,551
You certainly kept us
busy today, sir.

638
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,389
Yes. Thank you very much. Now I know
what she can do in evasive action.

639
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,556
Yes, sir.
That's right, sir.

640
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,591
She's good ship.

641
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,758
You couldn't expect her to do
any more and still be called a tug.

642
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,154
And a beautiful engine, chief.

643
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,157
You've every right
to be proud of her.

644
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,315
Right you are, sir.

645
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,833
By the way,
check your bilge pump, will you?

646
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:52,190
I think you'll find
something wrong there.

647
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:53,995
Aye-

648
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,075
Aye-aye, sir.

649
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:07,034
- Bo'sun!
- Aye, sir?

650
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,475
How does it behave?

651
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:13,514
Sir, it's terrible. It's a proper witch.
You never know what it's going to do.

652
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,359
Put it on the top of your list
for a complete overhaul.

653
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,788
List, sir?

654
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,069
Yes. Haven't you a note book
with a list of things to be done?

655
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,235
No, sir.

656
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,829
My bo'suns always have
a note book and a list.

657
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,917
Get one, Baker.
We'll charge it to petty cash.

658
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,075
Aye-aye, sir.

659
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,431
I'm not quite as particular
as Captain Van Dam,

660
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:34,393
but I do want everything on this
ship operational at all times.

661
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,194
Aye-aye, sir. I'll get that note
book as soon as we get ashore.

662
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,433
She's a nice little ship,
isn't she?

663
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:43,676
We were doing better than
16 knots some of the time.

664
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,949
Very nice, indeed.

665
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,119
Sir, I'm...

666
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,878
I... I'd just like
to say that...

667
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,355
Yes?

668
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,670
Well, I'd just like to say that I'm...
very glad to be serving under you.

669
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,350
Weaver, do you sing?

670
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,676
- Sing?
- No, I don't, sir.

671
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,110
Good. I think
we'll get along fine.

672
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,755
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

673
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,871
I... er... just came by
to return this.

674
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:43,593
- Who is it?
- David!

675
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:45,279
Yes, he's got your pipe.

676
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:47,277
My pipe? We've got enough
of everything, haven't we?

677
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:50,278
- Of course.
- Come in, we're having a party!

678
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,993
What's the occasin?

679
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,035
You suspect something,
don't you? Tell him.

680
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,956
We are going to be married.

681
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,912
Well, that's wonderful.

682
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,998
I wish you both all the happiness
in the worid. You're a lucky man.

683
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,794
- I'm a lucky man.
- Go on, kiss the bride.

684
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,838
Go on! You're going to
be the best man, kiss her!

685
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,792
- He's shy.
- Go on, kiss him.

686
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,148
There, that's a very
good best-man kiss.

687
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:21,396
Now, you watch me give my girl
a first-class husband kiss.

688
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:29,318
David, now ring up headquarters,
tell them where you are.

689
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,476
I'll open the wine, then
we'll eat, drink and be happy,

690
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,352
because we're all
wonderful people!

691
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,232
Stella, where's...
where's the corkscrew?

692
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,670
- The corkscrew?
- I don't remember.

693
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:39,472
I don't think we have one.

694
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,750
I'm sorry, it's my fault.
I should have thought of it.

695
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,155
Never mind,
I'll use something else.

696
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,748
Don't, you'll break it.

697
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,349
Nonsense. I've done
this millions of times.

698
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:55,954
Look, I'm bleeding!

699
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,149
Stop it!

700
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:09,199
Now... don't say
you told me so.

701
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,554
Go wash.

702
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:18,749
Change your shirt.

703
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,393
Yes. Yes, I'm sorry.

704
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,075
Yes?

705
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,752
Yes, it's Ford speaking.

706
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,197
Thanks a lot. You couldn't
have chosen a better time.

707
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:52,394
Yeah. Right.

708
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,549
Oh, wouldn't you know it!

709
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,830
Keep my share warm,
I'll be back Tuesday.

710
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,996
David, stay and keep Stella
company, there's a good fellow.

711
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,352
No, I'll see you to the ship.

712
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:05,312
You'll what? Why?

713
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:07,235
Please.

714
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,556
Well, I've asked you a dozen times,
and you've never wanted to.

715
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:10,988
I know, but tonight
I do want to.

716
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,510
Let's save it till daylight,
the sun's shining on the waters.

717
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,154
I'll have the boys sing us a shanty
as we shove off.

718
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,315
Chris, please.

719
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,671
Look, let's skip dinner tonight.
I'll see you later.

720
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:25,512
Now what's all this about?

721
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:27,915
I'm afraid.

722
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:30,955
Of what?

723
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:38,716
Now, now. This is an easy one. It's just
off the coast. I could swim out to it.

724
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,797
Please?

725
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,956
All right.
But we must get a move on.

726
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,909
- Good luck!
- Thanks.

727
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,877
Oh, captain, they've been calling you.

728
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,479
You've got an SOS too.

729
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,830
You're to get to
headquarters right away.

730
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:19,395
Thanks.

731
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:24,359
Here's your lame duck, here.
200 miles west of Bishop's Rock.

732
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,318
About 24 hours steaming.

733
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:30,238
That means daylight,
I'm afraid.

734
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,591
A bit awkward for you on your first time
out, but I'm sure you'll be all right.

735
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:35,518
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

736
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,389
What have we got, sir?

737
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,113
A freighter on fire.

738
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:04,388
If I'd known you were going to carry on
like this, I'd never have let you come down.

739
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:07,311
You've never behaved
this way before.

740
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:10,071
Just because we're
going to be married.

741
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,554
Well, I may change my mind.

742
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:15,589
That's better.

743
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,151
Now you go home and try not to
get lost in the dark, won't you?

744
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:22,315
Good girl.

745
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:39,112
- Skipper.
- Yes?

746
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,119
- Ready when you are, sir.
- I'll be right out.

747
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:45,475
Oh, Weaver?

748
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,357
I thought we were supposed to have the new
armour plate for the wheelhouse windows today.

749
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,353
Yes... yes, I know, sir.
They just didn't come.

750
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,709
They'll be here soon, I hope.

751
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:00,115
I'm sure they will. Okay.

752
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,635
How far do you
make her out now?

753
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,159
About 5 miles, sir.

754
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,759
Keep your fingers crossed.

755
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:49,915
Sir!

756
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,031
Hard to starboard!
Hard to starboard!

757
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,476
Engine room, give me
everything you've got, flat out!

758
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,635
Aye-aye, sir!

759
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:22,992
Port, 20!

760
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,075
Full astern!

761
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,719
That would've been dead centre, sir.

762
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,592
- Full ahead!
- Full ahead, sir.

763
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,352
- Full astern.
- Astern, sir.

764
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,316
- Port, 20!
- 20 to port, sir.

765
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,231
Who told them
to stop shooting?

766
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,960
- Hard to starboard!
- It's jammed, sir!

767
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,276
Come on, get on it, son!

768
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,035
Port, 20!

769
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,831
The Marines have landed.

770
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,109
How did it go?
Can't complain.

771
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,956
Kane, you'd better take over
until further notice.

772
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,194
Okay.

773
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,558
What happened?

774
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,988
We were strafed.

775
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,714
- Which of you is skipper of W-88?
- He is.

776
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,035
Thank you very much, skipper.

777
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,038
I must say, you fellows
certainly know your job.

778
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:53,755
Thanks... Thanks very much.
Fill out your report there, will you?

779
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:58,995
How did it happen?

780
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:01,475
I told you.
We were strafed. Twice.

781
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,557
We were on our way home.

782
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,671
He was too slow taking cover.

783
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,633
Got it on the second run,
right across here.

784
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:11,070
Knocked him
right over the side.

785
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,669
He was probably dead
by the time he hit the water.

786
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,078
Said he was getting married.

787
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,715
Yes, I know.

788
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,716
Somebody'll have
to tell his girl.

789
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,675
I know her. I'll do it.

790
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,673
- Did he give you the key?
- Yes.

791
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:37,955
Well...

792
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,955
Have a good time.

793
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:43,317
As long as it lasts.

794
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:09,113
Waiting for Number 12?

795
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:10,469
Yes. Is she out?

796
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,275
She's never out, that one. Not even
to do her shopping. I do that for her.

797
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,277
You try again, captain.

798
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,839
Stella?

799
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,995
I'm sorry.

800
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:11,789
They were strafed.

801
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:17,035
He was hit by machine-gun fire,
and he fell overboard.

802
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,834
Would you like some coffee?
No, thanks.

803
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:22,474
There isn't much in the house,
but I can open a tin.

804
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,159
I'm not hungry, thanks.

805
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:26,957
I could give you
some soup or a sandwich.

806
01:01:27,160 --> 01:01:28,957
I really don't care
for anything.

807
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:32,675
Look, they tried to find him.
I... I checked.

808
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:35,189
They searched
as long as they could.

809
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,236
They were sure that
he was dead when...

810
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:42,390
when he went
over the side.

811
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:44,591
When do you want the flat?

812
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,196
I... I don't want it,
it's yours.

813
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,039
No, it's your now.
You promised him you would take it.

814
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,310
Otherwise, he would not
have given you the key.

815
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,158
I know all about it.

816
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,557
Yes, but I don't want it. I...
I wouldn't think of it.

817
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,677
The rent is paid until
the end of the month.

818
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,074
The chimney should be cleaned.

819
01:02:04,280 --> 01:02:06,840
There is enough hot water
if you're careful.

820
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,553
Oh, the woman downstairs
will do your shopping.

821
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,830
You must watch her,
but she's kind.

822
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:13,759
Or you can do it yourself.
The shop's are not very far.

823
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,520
Fruit and vegetables are scarce-
Please! Please!

824
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,799
I'm sorry, I...

825
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,390
I mean, I know you're upset and
trying to make it easy on me, but...

826
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:30,309
This conversation about food and flat
and shopping and fruits and vegetables-

827
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,556
They're always hungry
when they come back.

828
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:35,395
They?

829
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,276
I thought we were
talking about Chris.

830
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:41,311
Chris is dead.
They are all dead.

831
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:44,992
Yes, they are,
aren't they?

832
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:48,871
You know something?

833
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:51,150
I think that first
impressions are the best.

834
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,788
Now I know where I am.

835
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,635
How would it be
if I moved in tonight?

836
01:02:57,840 --> 01:02:59,558
I told you, the flat is yours.

837
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:00,988
And what about you?

838
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,758
Would you stay
if I ask you?

839
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:03,915
If you like.

840
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,231
And he was going
to marry you.

841
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,438
Maybe in a way it's
better that he got killed.

842
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,634
Oh, I see.
You're shocked.

843
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,353
I'm sorry.

844
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:22,836
I didn't think all those rules
were so important any more,

845
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,996
now that people are so busy
killing each other.

846
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:38,872
If you want anything, you can...
telephone me at the hotel or send a note.

847
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,392
Stay here as long
as you want.

848
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:47,275
If you want to go some place else,
I'll help you make the arrangements.

849
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,075
Thank you.

850
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,675
Goodnight.

851
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:12,795
Want a bottle
of whiskey, captain?

852
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,319
No. No, thanks.

853
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:16,476
- Canteen price.
- You save money.

854
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,671
No, thanks. Goodnight.

855
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,233
Stingy basket!

856
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,474
Get moving here! Fire!

857
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,077
Ruddy thing's stuck, sir!

858
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,350
Get up some steam.
There isn't time. Full ahead!

859
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,515
Fire!

860
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:53,879
Heave!

861
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,309
Heave!

862
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:02,709
Heave!

863
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,674
If we can't hit them at this range,
we can't hit anything!

864
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,758
300 yards. They've never been
this close before.

865
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,109
Heave!

866
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:15,029
Why aren't
they shooting?

867
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:19,237
I don't know.
Why aren't we shooting?

868
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,509
Fire!

869
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:22,153
- Fire!
- Action stations!

870
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:23,554
Fire, why don't you?

871
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,909
Come on, start firing!

872
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:37,113
What's the matter here?
What are you playing at?

873
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,080
What's the matter with you
down there? Fire! We can hit him!

874
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:44,396
It's jammed again, sir.

875
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,035
Engine room?

876
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:01,117
Engine room,
give me everything you got.

877
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:04,710
And if you mention the word "boiler",
I'll... I'll shove you into it!

878
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,234
I want that gun fixed.

879
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,668
You're the captain,
give the order.

880
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,598
I could've got that sub,
if I'd had a decent gun.

881
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:12,755
Yes, I'm sure
you could have.

882
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,916
They know we can't hurt them.
He came right alongside.

883
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,314
So you said.

884
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,559
Confidentially, we've just got the story
on this sub that's been worrying you.

885
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,432
It isn't a mine-layer at all.

886
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,189
It's an old French training ship that the Germans
have taken over and are using for the same purpose.

887
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,674
I should imagine they were giving the
new boys a chance to look you over,

888
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,029
that's what
it sounds like to me.

889
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:33,195
A training ship?

890
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:37,234
The captain's an old gunnery instructor
whose name, of all things, is Hasenfratz.

891
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:38,395
Would you believe it?

892
01:06:38,600 --> 01:06:40,511
You mean, we're being
used for target practice?

893
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,755
Exactly.

894
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:45,475
Old Hasenfratz couldn't ask for anything
better. You make perfect targets.

895
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,591
You're small, but not too small, fast-

896
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,119
But not too fast, yes!

897
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:52,270
I don't think we should let it
be generally known, do you?

898
01:06:54,120 --> 01:06:55,348
Then why did you tell me?

899
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:57,437
I thought it might be
of some help to you.

900
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,757
The only thing that might be of some
help would be some decent guns.

901
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:03,793
So why don't you try to get some, instead of
sitting there playing with that silly lighter?

902
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,798
There's no need
to be offensive, old chap.

903
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:09,036
You may not believe it,
but I've done my best.

904
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,231
I've been pleading for guns
ever since I was sent here.

905
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,318
By now, I'm sure they're filing my
reports in the nearest wastepaper basket.

906
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,511
The fact is, we don't have them.

907
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,871
We haven't any decent guns to give you.
There simply aren't enough to go round.

908
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:21,957
We haven't even got the new
armour plating we've asked for.

909
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,912
Look, you may
as well know it.

910
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:26,236
Every time a freighter's
left behind, it's written off.

911
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:28,317
Every time you bring
one in, it's sheer profit.

912
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:31,557
I'll go on pestering them for guns
till I'm black in the face

913
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:33,990
and they kick me out
to get rid of the buzzing in their ears!

914
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:37,237
But if you want my honest
opinion, you won't get your guns

915
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:40,557
till every merchantman in the
allied fleet has been fitted out.

916
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,751
I'm sorry, but that's how it is.

917
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,757
If it's any consolation to you,

918
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:54,679
you might care to consider
that you're not the only one.

919
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,117
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

920
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,038
No, no, I'm really sorry.

921
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,037
It's so hot in here. How
would you like to get some air?

922
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,832
On the beach, like?

923
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:15,995
That's nice.

924
01:08:16,200 --> 01:08:17,553
I've heard that one before.

925
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:21,116
The only social service I do
is on a dance floor, sailor.

926
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:36,154
Congratulations, captain.

927
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,155
Thanks.

928
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,315
Moved into the flat yet?

929
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:44,193
No, I haven't moved
into the flat yet.

930
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:41,669
Hey, captain. Do you want a bottle
of whiskey? The best of Scotch?

931
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,155
Yes.

932
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,838
- How much?
- Canteen price.

933
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:52,674
One pound.

934
01:09:52,880 --> 01:09:54,632
Er... three pounds.

935
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:00,753
Listen, Hasenfratz,

936
01:10:01,920 --> 01:10:06,152
I happen to know that canteen price
is a pound, one pound!

937
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:09,557
The canteen is closed.
It's three pounds.

938
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:12,513
How would you like it
if I broke your neck?

939
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,030
It'll still be the same price.
Three pounds.

940
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,438
Happy dreams, captain.

941
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:50,115
Well?

942
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:52,713
Here comes another one.

943
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,671
I'm sorry.
I lost my balance.

944
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:07,511
And that's not all I lost.

945
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:12,077
When I came here,
I lost my... dignity,

946
01:12:12,280 --> 01:12:14,430
and I lost my self-respect.

947
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:18,549
You know what I mean?

948
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:26,754
I'm drunk.

949
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:31,154
I'm drunk, so I'm going home.

950
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:37,433
Home to the Grand Hotel.
Room 77.

951
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:52,874
Don't send me
to Room 77, Stella.

952
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,832
I'll get sick to my stomach.

953
01:13:06,000 --> 01:13:06,955
Thank you.

954
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,359
You know, everybody thinks they're
different. We're all the same.

955
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:17,473
I'm no different
from Chris or Van Barger.

956
01:13:19,240 --> 01:13:20,878
Or that other fella up here.

957
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:23,873
Knock, knock. Who's there?

958
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,237
You know, you've got enough jackets
in there to open up a clothing store.

959
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:32,835
Hi, Philip.

960
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:41,437
It's too bad you are what you are.

961
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:44,079
But you are, aren't you?

962
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,038
You come with the flat, don't you?

963
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:54,199
Hey, Stella.

964
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:56,960
You had a hunch that Chris
was going to get it, didn't you?

965
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,231
I could see it on your face.

966
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:01,998
You had a premonition.

967
01:14:03,200 --> 01:14:04,553
Can you always tell?

968
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:06,315
Number, please.

969
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,511
218, please.

970
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,672
Once upon a time, there was a
little man by the name of Hasenfratz-

971
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:14,677
If there are any calls
for Captain Ross,

972
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,791
he can be reached
at this number.

973
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,592
407.

974
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,074
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

975
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:28,237
That was a brave thing to do.

976
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,719
I'm not brave.

977
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:31,875
I'm scared.

978
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,636
For the first time,
I'm really scared.

979
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:40,437
For the first time, I know
what Chris was talking about.

980
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:43,473
You know, they're all scared.

981
01:14:44,560 --> 01:14:47,518
But I'm a captain.
I'm not supposed to be scared.

982
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:52,311
What did he tell me for?

983
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,429
I didn't want to know.

984
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:57,073
Who wants to be a target?

985
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,634
That's inhuman.

986
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,268
There's no dignity.

987
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,913
There's no...

988
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:06,075
That's no...

989
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:08,115
No...

990
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:11,035
Stella!

991
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:13,399
Don't go away.
Where are you going?

992
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,114
Too bad.

993
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:26,435
Hi.

994
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:29,395
Hello.

995
01:16:32,040 --> 01:16:33,871
How did it go?
All right.

996
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:37,235
I, er...

997
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:46,474
Er... thought the place
could stand some flowers.

998
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:49,033
They are very pretty.

999
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:51,915
Thank you.

1000
01:16:53,920 --> 01:16:56,480
I'll go and wash.
I know you must be hungry.

1001
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:16,676
He says:
"Water pressure damaged,

1002
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,236
"fire in bow is out of control
and nearing forward oil tanks.

1003
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,749
"Can you help?"
In what particular way?

1004
01:17:22,960 --> 01:17:24,996
I think he means, can we
help put out his fires, sir.

1005
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,872
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

1006
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:29,275
Okay. Tell him we're coming
with every bucket we've got.

1007
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,389
What's he saying now?

1008
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,433
He says he's very sorry and he
hopes he doesn't blow up in your...

1009
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:41,595
Face.

1010
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:52,550
- Port a little!
- Port a little, sir!

1011
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,679
The line-gun ready?

1012
01:17:56,120 --> 01:17:59,556
Be quick as you can
with the connecting up, please!

1013
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,953
Steady as you go!

1014
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:04,037
- Steady as you go, sir!
- Fire hoses standing by, sir.

1015
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,592
There's a line coming!

1016
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:14,191
Let's go, forward hoses!

1017
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,469
Midship hoses!

1018
01:18:16,680 --> 01:18:17,908
Ready, hoses!

1019
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:26,192
Line-gun! Fire!

1020
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,629
Please be quick
with your connecting up!

1021
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:49,949
Weaver,
is your insurance all paid up?

1022
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,115
Yes, sir.

1023
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:52,753
You're a very smart fella.

1024
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,834
Ready, sir.

1025
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,189
Take it away!

1026
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:39,711
Stand by and single up!

1027
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:42,309
Hurry up with the towing spring there!

1028
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,159
Anything I should
know, captain?

1029
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:47,430
No, you're all set.
You can shove off anytime.

1030
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,756
Thank you.
How did it go?

1031
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,515
Good luck.

1032
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:55,951
You've ordered the Pom-Pom overhauled
again. You know it is a waste of time.

1033
01:19:56,160 --> 01:19:58,720
Probably, but I still like
a gun that shoots.

1034
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,911
And I hear you have
moved from the hotel.

1035
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:03,998
You don't really have to bother
keeping tabs on me, captain.

1036
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,997
That woman is bad luck.

1037
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:08,031
She'll kill you.

1038
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,117
Like she's killed all the others.

1039
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:12,629
Oh, er, captain, do you sing?

1040
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:19,075
No better than the last time
you asked me. Sorry.

1041
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:21,475
Oh, yes, yes, yes. I remember. Pity.

1042
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:23,591
Come, Hansie. Now we go to work.

1043
01:20:30,240 --> 01:20:31,719
Goodnight, sir.
Goodnight.

1044
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,512
Night, sir.
Goodnight.

1045
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:35,358
Let go forward!

1046
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,439
Let go aft!

1047
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,155
...there seems little to report since our
last bulletin. And that is the end of the news.

1048
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,870
- Oh, I'll get out of your hair.
- No, it's all right.

1049
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,392
This is awfully good chocolate.

1050
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,910
Thank you. Not as good
as we have at home.

1051
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,917
Oh? Where's that?

1052
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:09,269
Switzerland.

1053
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:13,718
But you have an...
you have an Italian accent?

1054
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,514
I know, because I come
from the Italian side.

1055
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:23,594
I've never been to Switzerland.
They say it's beautiful.

1056
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,677
Oh, yes, it's lovely.

1057
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:28,314
I lived on a farm
very high up in the mountains.

1058
01:21:29,240 --> 01:21:30,275
Like Heidi?

1059
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,148
There was a little lake,
very pretty, always blue.

1060
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:36,157
You must miss it?

1061
01:21:36,360 --> 01:21:37,588
No.

1062
01:21:37,800 --> 01:21:40,951
My family are dead
and I had no friends.

1063
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,598
Must have been lonely.

1064
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:47,472
Perhaps I was.

1065
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,675
When I was very small,
my grandmother told me a story

1066
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:54,599
about two lovers who
were separated by the sea.

1067
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:58,475
And they used to send each other
letters in little boxes on the tide.

1068
01:21:59,960 --> 01:22:01,871
I thought it was a wonderful story.

1069
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:05,834
I wrote "I love you" on a little
piece of paper and I put it in a tin,

1070
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:08,998
and one morning I went down
to the lake and I let it float away.

1071
01:22:09,200 --> 01:22:13,512
I hoped that someone on the far shore
would find it and write back to me.

1072
01:22:13,720 --> 01:22:14,675
Did they?

1073
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,838
No. Would you like
some more chocolate?

1074
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:19,989
No, thanks.

1075
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:21,838
I'll get your sleeping pills.

1076
01:22:43,240 --> 01:22:44,309
Goodnight.

1077
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:45,555
Goodnight.

1078
01:23:17,080 --> 01:23:18,229
Fire!

1079
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:22,511
Fire! He's right on top of us!

1080
01:23:26,120 --> 01:23:27,109
No! No!

1081
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:30,795
No!

1082
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:38,475
No...

1083
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:39,194
Mine!

1084
01:24:42,440 --> 01:24:44,192
- Hard to starboard!
- Hard to starboard, sir!

1085
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,553
Hard to port!

1086
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,991
Blow it up!
Make sure we're clear!

1087
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:37,797
David, the telephone!

1088
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:41,800
David!
It's all right, darling, I've got it.

1089
01:25:42,000 --> 01:25:43,513
I beg your pardon.

1090
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:47,712
Sorry, I was talking
to someone else. What is it?

1091
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:49,069
Oh, nothing really.

1092
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:53,558
I just thought you might like to know the
United States of America have come into the war.

1093
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,990
No kidding! On which side?

1094
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:58,634
I think that's in rather
poor taste, old chap,

1095
01:25:58,840 --> 01:26:00,637
considering they're your people
and they've done more-

1096
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:04,276
Forgive me, commander. I guess
I'm not quite awake. What happened?

1097
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:06,835
It seems the Japanese bombed
some place called Pearl Harbour.

1098
01:26:07,040 --> 01:26:09,349
Did a lot of damage too.
Lots of casualties, I'm afraid.

1099
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,074
Oh, I'm sorry.
They must be crazy!

1100
01:26:12,280 --> 01:26:13,599
What is it?

1101
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,916
It's all right, darling.
It's good news in the long run.

1102
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:18,554
- Yes, isn't it, darling?
- See you soon, darling.

1103
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,112
What is it, David?

1104
01:26:26,120 --> 01:26:27,269
What did he say?

1105
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,988
Come here, I'll tell you.

1106
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,271
Tell me now!

1107
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,352
America's come into the war.

1108
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:45,630
Does that mean that
you will get better guns?

1109
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:47,273
I hope so.

1110
01:26:48,640 --> 01:26:51,108
Right now, I'd like
to get some breakfast.

1111
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:53,833
It's a-possible?

1112
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:56,110
It's possible.

1113
01:26:58,120 --> 01:26:59,075
Hey...

1114
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,115
Philip?

1115
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:33,915
Philip...

1116
01:27:36,360 --> 01:27:38,351
Oh, dear God! Philip!

1117
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:42,674
Oh! Forgive me, Philip!

1118
01:27:44,360 --> 01:27:45,713
Oh, forgive me!

1119
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,198
Home and dry
in an hour, sir.

1120
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:40,476
This is all highly irregular.

1121
01:29:40,680 --> 01:29:41,749
There is something wrong?

1122
01:29:41,960 --> 01:29:46,750
Yes, well, you see, you were reported
killed in an air raid almost a year ago,

1123
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,110
and it'll be
a fearful mess to untangle.

1124
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:50,275
Oh...

1125
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,077
Well, what can we do?

1126
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,396
Well, what was it
you wanted anyway?

1127
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,875
Well, I... I thought
I could do some kind of work

1128
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,799
at home on parachutes,
perhaps... anything.

1129
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,956
Oh, yes, I see.

1130
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:06,118
Right, fill out this form,
will you, please?

1131
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:07,275
Thank you.

1132
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:10,313
It's bound to cause
a great deal of confusin.

1133
01:30:10,520 --> 01:30:12,192
Well, I'm very sorry.

1134
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:25,919
Hey, where are you?

1135
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:33,915
Stella?

1136
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,350
- Oh, thank goodness!
- She told me you were back.

1137
01:31:01,120 --> 01:31:04,317
- I've been out shopping.
- Oh, so I see.

1138
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:07,398
It was exciting.
I'll bet.

1139
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,034
How do you like
my new dress, hm?

1140
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:11,195
I love it.

1141
01:31:11,400 --> 01:31:14,710
You know, a woman at the Labour
Exchange said I was killed by a bomb,

1142
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,512
and she was very angry with me.

1143
01:31:16,720 --> 01:31:18,119
Oh...

1144
01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:22,640
How pretty. Thank you.

1145
01:31:22,840 --> 01:31:23,795
You're welcome.

1146
01:31:25,160 --> 01:31:27,958
Are you all right?
How did it go?

1147
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,639
Fine. No trouble.

1148
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:32,195
Hasenfratz never
showed up at all.

1149
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:35,392
Why didn't you wake me
when you left?

1150
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,797
Because you look so pretty
when you're asleep.

1151
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:46,117
I... woke myself up... anyway.

1152
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,550
- Did you?
- Yes.

1153
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:56,275
When I came in
and you weren't here,

1154
01:31:57,120 --> 01:31:58,917
I thought you'd gone away.

1155
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:00,075
Never.

1156
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:02,473
Never go away.

1157
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:05,715
Never.

1158
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:15,348
If you're going to be
doing the shopping,

1159
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:16,629
going in and out,

1160
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,353
you'll need a key.

1161
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,790
I've got an extra one.

1162
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,879
I had one made. I've just been
carrying it around with me.

1163
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:28,355
I think you ought
to have it from now on.

1164
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:43,195
Would you marry me, David?
Only if you'll marry me.

1165
01:32:46,760 --> 01:32:48,751
You were very good to me.

1166
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,555
You put me to bed,
and you didn't ask questions.

1167
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:56,469
There's no sense in asking
questions if you know the answers.

1168
01:32:56,680 --> 01:32:59,194
- Do you?
- Yes.

1169
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,951
I would like to tell you...

1170
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:03,912
more than you know...

1171
01:33:04,120 --> 01:33:06,680
about Philip and afterward.

1172
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:08,199
Some other time.

1173
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,793
We have got lots of time.

1174
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:13,195
We've got all the time
in the worid.

1175
01:33:13,400 --> 01:33:14,833
Yes, we have.

1176
01:33:25,880 --> 01:33:28,792
I can't understand it. I got
a merit badge for this once.

1177
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,718
Never mind now. Look.

1178
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:34,112
Happy Christmas, darling.

1179
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,311
And very merry Christmas to you.

1180
01:33:42,720 --> 01:33:43,994
Shall we open
our presents now?

1181
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,315
No. Later.

1182
01:33:45,520 --> 01:33:47,033
Except this one.

1183
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:51,629
This is all for me?

1184
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:53,875
Hm.

1185
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:03,955
It's very nice.

1186
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:05,559
Open it.

1187
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:25,874
I haven't anything
nearly as nice for you.

1188
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:29,559
I'm not afraid.

1189
01:34:30,480 --> 01:34:31,435
Now sit down.

1190
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:35,079
No, sir. Not until I get
this roaring fire roaring!

1191
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:37,912
There's one last hope.

1192
01:34:40,560 --> 01:34:42,391
I don't know why this always works.

1193
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:46,469
But it creates a draught or something.

1194
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:50,679
You see, it's possible.

1195
01:35:07,560 --> 01:35:09,312
See, I told you it would work.

1196
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,996
We... better go down to the shelter.

1197
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:19,955
Yes.

1198
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:42,673
# In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep #

1199
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,511
# Nol, Nol ##

1200
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:07,869
Don't leave anything around.

1201
01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:10,719
And it's time that poor dog went out.

1202
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,837
- David.
- Yes, darling.

1203
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:40,794
What is it?

1204
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,989
Nothing. I...

1205
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:48,398
Oh, the food is all spoiled. I am
sorry. Shall I make you some chocolate?

1206
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,752
No, thanks. Not for me.
I'm tired. I think I'll go to bed.

1207
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:55,110
Shall we open our presents now?

1208
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,828
Let's do it in the morning, huh?

1209
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:00,475
All right.

1210
01:37:02,280 --> 01:37:04,635
Are you going somewhere?

1211
01:37:04,840 --> 01:37:06,592
Would you mind
if I go to midnight mass?

1212
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:12,550
No, I don't mind. It's late.
I'll walk you to the church.

1213
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,716
No, I'll be all right.
No, I'll walk you to the church.

1214
01:37:14,920 --> 01:37:16,194
No, please.

1215
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:17,753
You need your rest.

1216
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:29,916
What's the matter?

1217
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:31,917
Nothing. I wasn't sleepy.

1218
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,434
Was it a nice mass?

1219
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,554
I didn't go in.

1220
01:38:39,840 --> 01:38:42,195
I didn't think I had the right.

1221
01:39:00,800 --> 01:39:04,839
Excuse me. Your telephone seems to have gone
out of order in the raid, and they sent me over.

1222
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:06,189
Skipper, we've got a job.

1223
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,554
It's Van Dam's turn.

1224
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:15,718
Yes. They can't find him.
They want us right away.

1225
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:19,431
Okay.
I'll go on ahead.

1226
01:39:19,640 --> 01:39:20,595
So sorry.

1227
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:27,116
I'll make you some coffee.

1228
01:39:28,240 --> 01:39:29,958
I don't think there's time.

1229
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:51,349
Where are you going?

1230
01:39:51,560 --> 01:39:54,028
I want to go with you to the pier.

1231
01:39:57,800 --> 01:39:59,438
It's too late. I...

1232
01:40:00,960 --> 01:40:03,110
I don't want you coming home
alone so late.

1233
01:40:07,680 --> 01:40:09,875
You can see me off some other time.

1234
01:40:10,680 --> 01:40:11,635
Don't worry.

1235
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:13,034
Nothing to worry about.

1236
01:40:13,240 --> 01:40:14,389
David, please.

1237
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,158
I said no.

1238
01:40:20,200 --> 01:40:21,349
Go to bed, you hear?

1239
01:40:21,560 --> 01:40:23,551
David... don't go.

1240
01:40:26,720 --> 01:40:30,269
Look, I don't believe in premonitions,
yours or anyone else's!

1241
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:34,314
And I'll tell you something else. A
man once told me you were bad luck.

1242
01:40:35,080 --> 01:40:37,674
And I don't believe that either!
Then there was Chris.

1243
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,718
He said that none of us
would get out of this alive.

1244
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:43,399
But if that's true,

1245
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,113
then there's nothing.

1246
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:48,596
Nothing to hope for, nothing to believe
in. We've just been kidding ourselves.

1247
01:40:49,600 --> 01:40:51,397
It's not true!

1248
01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:53,272
I'm not like the others!

1249
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:57,029
I'm not going to wind up just
another jacket on a hanger in there!

1250
01:40:58,000 --> 01:40:59,752
And I'm not going to die!

1251
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,313
Not tonight, anyway.

1252
01:41:03,160 --> 01:41:04,115
Go to bed.

1253
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,877
Lord, what a mess!

1254
01:41:19,080 --> 01:41:20,877
Just listen to him squeak.

1255
01:41:25,880 --> 01:41:27,279
What's the story on Van Dam?

1256
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:29,072
I don't know.
He hasn't turned up.

1257
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:31,919
We're hoping it's nothing
to do with the bombing.

1258
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:34,549
Okay, what have I got?

1259
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:38,070
Freighter on fire.
In position 50 north, 9 west.

1260
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:55,353
That's not a duck, is it?

1261
01:41:56,360 --> 01:41:57,315
It is.

1262
01:41:58,120 --> 01:42:01,157
- Sending an open SOS?
- Yes.

1263
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:05,872
- Another one.
- No. I'm afraid it's yours.

1264
01:42:12,240 --> 01:42:15,357
Don't be silly. He hasn't
been squeaking all this time.

1265
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:21,188
Is he crazy? He'll have every U-boat
in the North Atlantic swarming all over him!

1266
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:24,233
I can only think he's forgotten
to open his sealed instructions.

1267
01:42:24,440 --> 01:42:27,238
He's one of your people.
It's our first all-American convoy.

1268
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:29,271
Carrying guns,
oddly enough.

1269
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,868
Why don't you tell them?

1270
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:44,036
What have you
got them for?

1271
01:42:44,240 --> 01:42:46,595
We can't, sir.
His receiver's not working.

1272
01:42:55,440 --> 01:42:56,793
I'm not going.

1273
01:43:08,920 --> 01:43:09,909
Why should I?

1274
01:43:11,040 --> 01:43:12,598
What do I tell my crew?

1275
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:16,395
"This is the end of the line"?

1276
01:43:16,600 --> 01:43:20,718
"There isn't a chance in the worid, but let's
all go out and get killed because we're heroes"?

1277
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:23,552
"Hurry for the Light Brigade"?

1278
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,151
W-86 has just come in.

1279
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:50,954
I'm sending her out as soon as
I can get another crew together.

1280
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:54,072
I'm afraid it's bad luck all round,
but I'm sure you'll make the best of it.

1281
01:43:56,040 --> 01:43:56,995
Sure.

1282
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,518
Let's get moving W-86.

1283
01:45:11,200 --> 01:45:12,474
Stand by to cast off.

1284
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,236
All right, let's get moving.

1285
01:45:31,440 --> 01:45:32,395
Skipper-

1286
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:34,556
How about getting
this ship ready for sea?

1287
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:16,513
Skipper...

1288
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,115
Yes?

1289
01:46:22,320 --> 01:46:25,756
On the radio, that duck's
sending out an open SOS.

1290
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,155
Yes, I know.

1291
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:32,035
Well, they're not really going to send us
out, are they? I mean, it's hopeless, isn't it?

1292
01:46:32,240 --> 01:46:34,071
There's no point to it, is there?

1293
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,748
Maybe if you were to talk
to them at headquarters...

1294
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:39,269
Sparks, when I want
your advice, I'll ask for it!

1295
01:46:40,240 --> 01:46:41,798
Get back to the radio.

1296
01:46:42,720 --> 01:46:43,755
Yes, sir.

1297
01:46:43,960 --> 01:46:45,279
Sorry, sir.

1298
01:46:47,320 --> 01:46:48,275
Sparks...

1299
01:46:53,000 --> 01:46:53,955
Nothing.

1300
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:55,475
Hey!

1301
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:00,514
Here.

1302
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:11,673
We're ready, skipper.

1303
01:48:16,640 --> 01:48:18,358
All right, shove off.

1304
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:50,233
Always the same?

1305
01:48:52,440 --> 01:48:54,351
Always to end like this?

1306
01:48:57,480 --> 01:48:58,913
Is there no pity?

1307
01:49:03,600 --> 01:49:04,555
Please.

1308
01:49:09,360 --> 01:49:10,315
Please?

1309
01:49:28,800 --> 01:49:30,074
I can't see what he's firing at.

1310
01:49:30,280 --> 01:49:32,669
- Have we got a chance, skipper?
- We'll be all right.

1311
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:34,233
I don't see how
we can be, frankly.

1312
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:35,429
- Sir!
- Yes?

1313
01:49:35,640 --> 01:49:39,349
He says they've used up all their ammunition
and you can't depend on him for covering fire.

1314
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:42,118
Does he say
how many subs he's got?

1315
01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:44,038
No, sir.

1316
01:49:55,920 --> 01:49:57,114
That does it.

1317
01:50:20,080 --> 01:50:22,150
Engine room! Engine room!

1318
01:50:32,400 --> 01:50:33,833
Secure the bulkheads!

1319
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:50,233
Hard to port!

1320
01:50:52,680 --> 01:50:53,829
I said hard to port!

1321
01:50:54,040 --> 01:50:56,076
She's fouled, sir.
She won't turn except to starboard.

1322
01:51:29,200 --> 01:51:31,270
The engine room's gone and
the boiler's going any minute.

1323
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:40,551
All right, abandon ship!

1324
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,830
Get out! I'm going
to ram them! Get out!

1325
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:49,270
Abandon ship!
Abandon ship!

1326
01:52:53,240 --> 01:52:56,994
"Tug... blew up... ramming sub.

1327
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:02,913
"What... happens... now?"

1328
01:53:37,040 --> 01:53:38,553
Operator?
Sir?

1329
01:53:38,760 --> 01:53:40,830
See if you can reach W-86.

1330
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,313
Steady as you go.

1331
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,355
Dead slow.

1332
01:53:56,680 --> 01:53:57,635
Dead slow, sir.

1333
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,235
David?

1334
01:54:37,400 --> 01:54:38,355
I'm sorry.

1335
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:49,356
He gave you the key?

1336
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,915
Yes.

1337
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:09,195
Look, look, I'm all right. Let go!

1338
01:55:09,400 --> 01:55:11,550
You'll stay here
until that's stitched up.

1339
01:55:12,360 --> 01:55:14,112
I've got to get home!

1340
01:55:15,280 --> 01:55:20,070
Are you the guy that rammed that sub and saved
my ship? Mister, I want to shake your hand.

1341
01:55:20,280 --> 01:55:22,794
Why did you break silence?

1342
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:24,558
Why didn't you follow
your instructions?

1343
01:55:27,040 --> 01:55:28,029
Instructions?

1344
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:30,310
I never had a chance
to open them up.

1345
01:55:30,520 --> 01:55:32,715
My chart room was busted
wide open on the first shot.

1346
01:55:32,920 --> 01:55:36,310
I think it would be a good idea if you two
fellow countrymen kissed and made up, don't you?

1347
01:55:36,520 --> 01:55:37,635
Or shook hands, anyway.

1348
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,638
Look, I want to thank you.
I really want to thank you.

1349
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:44,833
I want to show you somebody who'll never
forget what you did for them tonight.

1350
01:55:55,840 --> 01:55:58,035
Oh, this lousy war.

1351
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:02,028
Yeah, and yours is
only three weeks old.

1352
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:25,795
Get out.

1353
01:56:29,200 --> 01:56:30,519
Get out!

1354
01:56:45,800 --> 01:56:48,633
# The flat-foot floogie
With the floy doy #

1355
01:56:48,840 --> 01:56:51,115
# The flat-foot floogie
With the floy doy #

1356
01:56:51,320 --> 01:56:54,198
# Floy doy, floy doy
Floy doy, floy doy #

1357
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:57,153
# The flat-foot floogie
With the floy doy... ##

1358
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:11,835
I looked everywhere for you.
This was my last stop.

1359
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:15,350
How would you like to go
fifty-fifty on the flat?

1360
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:16,515
She's gone.

1361
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:21,833
Where?
London. I took her to the station.

1362
01:57:22,880 --> 01:57:24,757
- How was she?
- All right.

1363
01:57:24,960 --> 01:57:27,235
She asked me
to give you this.

1364
01:57:27,440 --> 01:57:29,351
She said you forgot.

1365
01:57:46,240 --> 01:57:48,515
When did she leave?

1366
01:57:48,720 --> 01:57:50,199
About now, I guess.

1367
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,911
Don't be a fool!
She's gone!

1368
01:58:06,000 --> 01:58:06,955
Ticket, please.

1369
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,995
Thank you.

1370
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,949
Sorry, too late!

1371
01:58:30,160 --> 01:58:31,798
- Let him go by!
- His girl's on that train!

1372
01:58:32,000 --> 01:58:33,194
I'm sorry, boys, it's too late.

1373
01:58:33,400 --> 01:58:35,595
Look, give him
a break, will you?

1374
01:59:41,600 --> 01:59:42,555
I'll find her.

1375
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:45,318
When I get back to London,
I'll find her.

1376
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:46,475
Sure.

1377
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:47,635
I will!
