1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,560
<i> It had been five months of the most
horrific warfare in Earth's history.</i>

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,440
<i>A war in which rivers of blood
flowed in trenches...</i>

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,480
<i>for a few yards of advancement.</i>

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,240
<i>A cold, modern war born
from ancient nationalist hatred.</i>

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,480
<i>A war which saw the introduction
of awesome technological weapons...</i>

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,400
<i>the machine gun...</i>

7
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,360
<i>the armored tank...</i>

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,920
<i>nerve gas.</i>

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,680
<i>And yet, on December 24, 1914...</i>

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,240
<i>German, British and French soldiers
climbed out of their trenches...</i>

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,360
<i>to meet in no-man's-land
to peacefully celebrate Christmas.</i>

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:46,440
<i>They sang Christmas carols,
exchanged cigarettes and autographs...</i>

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,480
<i>posed for pictures...</i>

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,840
<i>buried their dead.</i>

15
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,680
<i>The silence remained
throughout Christmas day.</i>

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,000
<i>In the following three years,
nearly eight million would die.</i>

17
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,280
<i>And less than two decades later...</i>

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,720
<i>the same armies would be engaged in the
greatest loss of human life in history.</i>

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,200
<i>The world had never seen
anything like it before.</i>

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,920
<i>And 149 years later to the day...</i>

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,840
<i>it's impossible to imagine
ever seeing it again.</i>

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Bandits! 2:00, 6:00!

23
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,480
I got it.

24
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,480
6:00! 6:00!

25
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Come on! Come on!

26
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,840
Get some!

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,000
Red Devil, this is Wild Card.
The enemy is superior.

28
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,520
We're tight on your 5:00.
Tight on your 5:00.

29
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,240
Bend over, chiggie man.

30
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,160
We're hit!

31
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,280
Engines one, two, four and five are out!
Mayday! Mayday!

32
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,420
The main port engine's
grinding us in an introverted spin.

33
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:41,060
It's venting fuel. Shut it down
and it might not fire up again.

34
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,140
<i>That freeze-dried burrito is talkin' to me!</i>

35
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,940
Shut down main port engine!

36
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,580
Burn primary and vernier R.C.S.
thrusters to stabilize!

37
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:59,260
Negative! It'll take all the thrusters fuel!
We can't land!

38
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,180
We'll roll forever!
Lose consciousness!

39
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,180
Well, fire those thrusters!

40
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,180
Burn 'em now to stabilize in four...

41
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:13,340
three, two, one... now!

44
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,540
<i>So much for the thrusters.</i>

45
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,220
Hey, good flying.
You did the right thing.

46
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,060
Home Base,
this is Wild Cards. Come in.

47
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,940
Repeat. Home Base,
this is Wild Cards. Come in.

48
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,020
Radio's dead.

49
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,940
<i>Yes, sir,
I definitely saw it.</i>

50
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,340
The ship in front of the 58th took a hit,
then they got it. Left engine.

51
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,340
- No, man, right engine.
- Right. Left. They're toast.

52
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,060
No, man, we got a Mayday
after they got hit.

53
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,420
- Where's the communications officer?
- Over there.

54
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,660
- Left.
- Right.

55
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,780
<i>You got a Mayday from the 58th?</i>

56
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:12,340
<i>Yes, sir. I confirmed they received
our signal, but they never responded.</i>

57
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,300
Transmitter could have been damaged.

58
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,900
Or there could have been
no one left to respond.

59
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,820
I want your radio receiver's log.

60
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,820
Get me the 58th's last known position.

61
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,820
Do it!

62
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,820
Inform Commodore Ross I want
10 S.A.R. teams formed immediately...

63
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,340
- to be deployed in 30 mikes.
- Aye aye, sir.

64
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,540
<i>Four out of 10
momentum wheels are down.</i>

65
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,820
Main propulsion system's inoperable.

66
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,100
<i>Partial pressure O2 sensor's
at 24 kilopascals.</i>

67
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,740
Main on board computer...

68
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:51,140
Is singing with Elvis.

69
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,860
- We're dead.
- Without a computer, we're on our own.

70
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,780
I guess it won't be the first time.

71
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,140
Damphousse, radio?

72
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,420
- Left high gain antenna damage is nominal. I think I can...
- Get on it.

73
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,900
- Right.
- Fuel cell damage?

74
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,060
<i>Extensive.
Solar arrays are inoperable.</i>

75
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,220
Fuel cells, secondary batteries
were low when the dogfight started.

76
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,020
We're gonna have to shut down some
electrical systems in order to save power...

77
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,300
<i>for cabin air, thermal control,
the radio, if it's working.</i>

78
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,700
<i>Without propulsion,
we won't need telemetry, navigation.</i>

79
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,540
But if we're getting home, it looks like
someone's gonna have to find us.

80
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,460
Make it happen.

81
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,420
Twelve minutes after midnight.

82
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,580
Christmas.

83
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,540
<i>Wild Cards, this is Queen 6.</i>

84
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,500
<i>Wild Cards, this is Queen 6.</i>

85
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:59,700
Queen 6, this is Wild Cards.
Queen 6, this is Wild Cards.

86
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:02,420
<i>Wild Cards, this is Queen 6.</i>

87
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,700
<i>- Respond.
- Queen 6, this is Wild Cards.</i>

88
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,260
<i>Queen 6, this is Wild Cards.</i>

89
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,620
No response, sir. And the T.D.R.S. system
confirms our signal has been received.

90
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:16,340
Have it pinpoint the location
of the signal reception.

91
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,260
The linking tracking satellite
was taken out in the firefight.

92
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,700
So what you're saying is they can hear us,
but we can't hear them.

93
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,380
Sir, just because a signal
is being received...

94
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,580
doesn't mean there's
anyone around to receive it.

95
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,180
They're out there.

96
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,340
I can feel 'em.

97
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,060
We believe your radio
to be in receive-only mode.

98
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,180
<i>We're presently conducting search and
rescue operations in the Procyon System.</i>

99
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,260
<i>I know you're out there.</i>

100
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,180
<i>Hold on.
Don't lose faith.</i>

101
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,540
We're not in the Procyon System.
We're far from it.

102
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,900
<i>- We got knocked out in the firefight.
- We're dumpin' in the river.</i>

103
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,300
That must be Hawkes's way of trying to say
that we're up a creek without a paddle.

104
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,220
Well, he's almost right.

105
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,140
If we were on Earth...

106
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,460
our ship would seem to be going through
the Eridanus Constellation.

107
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,460
A river of stars.

108
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,980
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

109
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:27,900
<i>in the winter,
it'd get dark real early.</i>

110
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:33,180
On my way home from basketball practice,
I'd see Eridanus in the sky.

111
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,700
It gave me comfort to see it
return every year...

112
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,620
to know some things
never went away.

113
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,540
We're gonna go away
we can't do somethin'.

114
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,700
If Wang knows our position,
we can send out a bistatic LIDAR flare.

115
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
If they find it,
they'll know our actual position.

116
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,820
B.L.F. canisters are fired
out of pulse cannons.

117
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,740
<i>We haven't the power.</i>

118
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,980
Look, we could drop it out of the air lock.
It's better than nothing.

119
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,980
It isn't better than nothing.
Our position is beyond the Von Braun line.

120
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,060
We're in no-man's-land...

121
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:05,380
<i>falling towards enemy territory.</i>

122
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,060
A flare will just announce
our presence to the Chigs.

123
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,980
<i>Colonel, you've requested 10 S.A.R.s to
search for the 5-8 in the Procyon region?</i>

124
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,340
- Yes, sir.
- That area was just subjected to an intensive aerial engagement...

125
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,260
one from which our heavily armed ships
were forced to retreat.

126
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,580
- I cannot dispatch 10 lightly armed...
- Then send five, sir.

127
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,460
<i>The battleship
Charles Lacy Veach is under attack.</i>

128
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,380
We have been ordered
to provide all possible...

129
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,940
Then send one, sir.
I'll fly it.

130
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:38,620
Colonel, searching for them with a hundred
ships in that vast a region of space...

131
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:43,140
is the equivalent of trying to find a specific
drop of water in the Mississippi River.

132
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,700
As long as I know that drop is there, sir,
I'm gonna try to find it.

133
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,140
You can have three ships.
No fighter support.

134
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,780
And the first sign of any Chigs,
they are to get the hell out of there.

135
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Aye aye.

136
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,300
Thank you, sir.

137
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,060
Cabin temperature is dropping.

138
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,660
Secondary power is running low,
that's why.

139
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,460
If I were at home
in New York tonight...

140
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,980
we'd all be around
the fireplace right now.

141
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,180
At this rate, in a couple of hours,
we'll be below freezing.

142
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,100
McQueen.

143
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,940
What the...

144
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,900
It's that old TV show...

145
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,460
where one guy's like a bat
and the other one's like a bird.

146
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,020
I liked that show.

147
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:50,940
Wow! I guess we caught a lucky break. A good
TV show before drifting off into eternity.

148
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:55,100
If we ever get home, we should chip
in and get McQueen a good therapist.

149
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,460
That's not McQueen.

150
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,500
Television signals have been inadvertently
beamed into space since the 1940s.

151
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,900
We're probably just intercepting it...

152
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,060
Chig fighters!

153
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,340
This is it.

154
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,020
<i>What the hell was that?</i>

155
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,140
Those were fighters,
not scouts.

156
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,740
Maybe they wanted to be
home for Christmas.

157
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:54,660
Must have taken us for dead.

158
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,380
No. They're like a cat
that's got a mouse by the tail.

159
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,380
Coop's right.

160
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,820
I don't know why they took off,
but they'll be back.

161
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,660
Chigs always finish the job.

162
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,300
Look, I know this is weird, but under these
circumstances, I don't want to not do it.

163
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,820
And I don't want you guys to
feel weird about it, all right?

164
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,020
I had been hiding them in here,
so I just happened to have 'em.

165
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,420
<i>Shane. I don't know what to say.</i>

166
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,940
<i>- You shouldn't do this.
- I just happened to have them. It's no big deal.</i>

167
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,660
Just pretend that there's a big
Christmas tree with lights...

168
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,780
and dinner cooking in the kitchen
and a big bag for the wrapping paper...

169
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,580
and we are far from this dark, cold box,
and it's safe and warm...

170
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,260
and the Whos in Whoville are singing
"Dah-Who-Dor-Eh, Dah-Who-Dor-Eh"... Just open 'em.

171
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,260
<i>I-I wish it could have been a necklace
or something, but...</i>

172
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:31,980
<i>we are light-years away from home and
that's all they had in the Saratoga P.X.</i>

173
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:35,380
Shane, it's beautiful.
Thank you.

174
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,340
They're engraved.

175
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,980
"To 'Phousse. Hoo-yah!
Christmas, 2063."

176
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,820
It'll be an honor to stab a Chig with this.

177
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,300
Mm.

178
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,300
<i>Uh, Nathan, you're hard to buy for.</i>

179
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:04,660
<i>You don't have too many
interests outside of Kylen.</i>

180
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,220
I guess I shouldn't have put it that way.

181
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:23,940
<i>Well, let's face it. Nathan
is a little different from the rest of us.</i>

182
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,220
You, Wang, Winslow...

183
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,340
<i>we all joined the Corps because we wanted
to be life-takers and heartbreakers.</i>

184
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:35,260
<i>Coop, he was sentenced to the Corps,
but he's got it in him.</i>

185
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:38,900
- West doesn't have it in him.
- Oh, yes, he does.

186
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,940
<i>And he's got
a lot more than that.</i>

187
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,660
<i>Nathan is not just some guy
pining away for his girlfriend.</i>

188
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,900
<i>She's become his faith. Something that he
would die for because he believes it's right.</i>

189
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,940
- Are you going to open yours, Coop?
- What's it for?

190
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,500
It's a Christmas present.

191
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,500
Listen, I, um,
I never told you guys this...

192
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,380
but I kinda took off from the InVitro
educational facility...

193
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,500
before they taught us stuff like this.

194
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,940
So, all I know about Christmas is that there
was one day out of the year in Philadelphia...

195
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,980
<i>that everything was closed
and it was a headache...</i>

196
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,020
and it was lonelier than usual.

197
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,860
<i>Coop, Christmas is the celebration
of the birth of Jesus Christ.</i>

198
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,980
Actually, it's the continuation
of the Roman festival of Saturnalia.

199
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,420
Jesus of Nazareth was born
on September 15, 7 B.C.

200
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:40,580
- Nazareth and Christ, now who are those guys?
- It's one guy.

201
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,620
<i>And He was born in Bethlehem.</i>

202
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,660
A star directed three wise men
from the East...

203
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,580
who believed the son of God had been born.

204
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:53,500
<i>And this "star" was actually a rare
alignment between Jupiter and Saturn...</i>

205
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,700
or possibly a supernova
or maybe even a comet.

206
00:16:56,780 --> 00:17:00,020
He was conceived through the miracle
of Immaculate Conception.

207
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,380
His mom and dad didn't... do it.

208
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,820
The myth of Immaculate Conception.

209
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,660
Be like an InVitro?

210
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,660
- You gonna open your present, Paul?
- Shane, it's, uh...

211
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,540
it's really nice of you to do this,
but I, uh, I can't take this.

212
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,580
<i>It's just I-I really don't
believe in it anymore.</i>

213
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:31,740
- That never stopped my family from opening gifts.
- Well, it stops me.

214
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,700
<i>Paul, you cross yourself
before every mission.</i>

215
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,460
It's superstition.
It's habit.

216
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,180
It's-It's like my Chicago Bears T-shirt.

217
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,460
Something happen to make you
feel this way?

218
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,340
With all the death we've seen
in the last six months.

219
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,580
The things I've... done!

220
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,940
How can you believe
in all this garbage?

221
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,660
<i>Shut it off!</i>

222
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,140
<i>Don't touch it!</i>

223
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,020
- Oh! It... It's frozen!
- The bolts are brittle. They're breaking.

224
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:13,820
West, decrease O2/N2
control valve to 400 KPS!

225
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,100
Lockhart, get those pipes secured, now!

226
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,340
Maybe some warm water.

227
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,300
<i>Look, even if we had hot water, it would
only cause these pipes to crack more.</i>

228
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:30,780
It's comin' off the hard way, Kelcher. Coop.

229
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,780
Come on.

230
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,660
It's all right.
It's all right.

231
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,300
- We probably lost about two hours of O2 supply just now.
- More.

232
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,260
Everyone's to limit their movement.

233
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,220
I know it's probably impossible,
but some sleep would help.

234
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,940
Yeah, that way we don't have
to see the Chigs coming.

235
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,100
I'll pull watch on the radio.

236
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,620
Oh, no, it's okay.

237
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:12,580
It's just... just that you got me
something makes me feel good.

238
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,180
Oh, Coop.

239
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:19,580
You may have run away
from that InVitro facility...

240
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,740
but you do know
what it's all about.

241
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,580
<i>Queen 6, this is S.A.R. 1.</i>

242
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:46,300
<i>We got a negative on any sighting
of the 58th, visual or LIDAR.</i>

243
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:50,620
<i>Permission to sweep area 300K
M.S.K.s from sight of dogfight.</i>

244
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,180
Roger that, S.A.R. 1.

245
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,500
Colonel, here's the optical disc
you requested.

246
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,260
Queen 6 to Wild Cards...

247
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:04,740
this is your interstellar disc jockey,
Colonel McQueen.

248
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,420
Here's a little something
I'd like you to hear.

249
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,380
It occurred 95 years ago last evening.

250
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,700
It's a message to the Earth
from the first men to orbit the moon.

251
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:20,460
It's not my Christmas present.
That'll be to get you home.

252
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:27,500
<i>"In the beginning,
God created the Heaven and the Earth.</i>

253
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:31,300
<i>"And the Earth
was without form and void.</i>

254
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,260
<i>"And darkness was upon
the face of the deep.</i>

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,220
<i>"And God said, 'Let there be light.'
And there was light.</i>

<i>"And God saw the light,
that it was good.</i>

257
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,180
<i>And God divided the light
from the darkness."</i>

258
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,980
<i>"And God called the light Day...</i>

259
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
<i>"and the darkness He called Night.</i>

260
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,500
<i>"And the evening and the morning

261
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,620
<i>"And God said, 'Let there be a firmament

262

<i>"let it divide the waters
from the waters.'</i>

263
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,380
<i>"And God made the firmament, and divided
the waters which were under the firmament...</i>

264
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:11,620
<i>"from the waters which were
above the firmament: and it was so.</i>

265
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:14,060
<i>"And God called
the firmament Heaven.</i>

266
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:17,300
<i>And the evening and the morning

267
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:21,060
<i>"And God said,
'Let the waters under the Heaven...</i>

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,460
<i>"be gathered together

269
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,940
<i>"And let the dry land appear':

270
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,820

271

272
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,540
<i>And God saw that it was good."</i>

273
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,900
<i>And from the crew of Apollo 8,
we close with good night...</i>

274
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,740
<i>good luck,
a merry Christmas...</i>

275
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,180
<i>and God bless all of you,
all of you on the good Earth.</i>

276
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,220
Chigs?

277
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,900
A comet.

278
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,980
And it's approaching at an angle and a
direction that's on a direct path with this ship.

279
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,340
How did you know it was there?

280
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,500
I don't know.

281
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,980
Those numbers mean anything
to the star charts?

282
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,900
Sorry, Colonel.

283
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:39,260
We had a little off-duty Christmas
Eve party in the astronomer's quarters.

284
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,980
Some corporal tried to make
scotch out of his aftershave...

285
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,660
and these charts are all looking like
nothing but a bunch of white dots.

286
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,340
There are men and women out there who will
never have the chance to have a hangover again...

287
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,300
if you don't get
those white dots focused.

288
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:56,500
Did you locate the source
of the transmissions?

289
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:00,180
They're not from any frequency used by the
Armed Forces, even classified frequencies.

290
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,780
And the Morse code, it's weird.
It's like broken English.

291
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,700
Like someone who doesn't quite know it.

292
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,620
All our pilots and crew
know it inside and out.

293
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,100
It could be a distress signal.

294
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,260
Any reports of civilian activity
in the Procyon region?

295
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,220
<i>You'd be looking in the wrong area.</i>

296
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,540
These coordinates indicate the position
of the comet Yanelli-Wimberly.

297
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,620
That's closer to Epsilon Eridanus.

298
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:31,220
<i>A short burn from the main engine
could take us out of its path.</i>

299
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:35,220
We'd run the risk of tumbling again
with no thrusters to stabilize.

300
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:39,660
- This code is weird.
- I'm telling you guys, it was really weird.

301
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,260
It's like I could feel,
even through the radio...

302
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,740
<i>that the sender wasn't human.</i>

303
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,580
<i>Are you sure you
recorded it correctly?</i>

304
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,820
Look, everybody's exhausted, okay?
We're freezing...

305
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,780
What do you mean,
did I get it right?

306
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,340
There's a comet barreling down on us we
wouldn't know about if I didn't get it right!

307
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:00,700
Wanger, why don't you let me
take a shift on that radio.

308
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,060
<i>- I'm fine.
- Hey, take a break, Paul.</i>

309
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,540
<i>- I'm fine!
- Take a break, Paul.</i>

310
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:18,260
<i>Wild Cards, this is Queen 6.</i>

311
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,020
<i>As your position remains
undetermined to us at present time...</i>

312
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,220
<i>we're reporting the presence of a comet...</i>

313
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,300
bearing 89 degrees by 15 degrees...

314
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,100
<i>0-niner in the Eridanus region.</i>

315
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,020
See, they intercepted the same signal.

316
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,580
- Think it could be an enemy trap?
- A trap?

317
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,220
They would've blown us out of
the sky when they flew by us.

318
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:40,500
Maybe they just wanted to save their
missiles and let this comet do the work.

319
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:45,500
5-8, we're still out there searching.
Don't let down.

320
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,380
<i>I've, uh, got a message here
from the commodore.</i>

321
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:56,340
<i>I won't insult you by wishing you
a merry Christmas, 5-8.</i>

322
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:58,740
<i>I'll say it to your faces when you return.</i>

323
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:04,140
Now, this may not be proper conduct
for a commander...

324
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,820
but given the circumstances, I, uh...

325
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,980
And, no, I am not drunk.

326
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,540
That's "I'll Be Home for Christmas".

327
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:44,900
M-Move it! Coop, move it!

328
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,060
Move it.

329
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,500
You've even got a problem
with a Christmas song?

330
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,460
Shut up!
Shut up!

331
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,020
<i>- What was it?
- Some scientific language.</i>

332
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:21,860
Rudimentary. As if Einstein were
trying to explain relativity to a child.

333
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,820
Give me a minute.

334
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,220
I know what it is.

335
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,580
Telemetry data...

336
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:59,220
orbital mass, ISSCV mass...

337
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,140
<i>speed, pitch, yaw...</i>

338
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,140
azimuth.

339
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,780
These are directions on how to get trapped
into an orbit of the approaching comet.

340
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,700
It's trying to tell us
how to hitch a ride.

341
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,220
<i>- What good would that do?
- Well, it's heading away from enemy territory.</i>

342
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,660
<i>In fact, back towards the Saratoga.</i>

343
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:21,060
We could drop a B.L.F. canister
once we got into friendly territory.

344
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,060
Can it be done?

345
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,500
Asteroids and comets have been known
to have orbiting satellites.

346
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,700
But if we follow these signals,
we'll be going on complete...

347
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,660
faith.

348
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,660
What needs to be done?

349
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,660
It would require an approximate
56 second burn from the main left engine.

350
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:47,700
Less than 56 seconds,
we'll miss the comet's gravitational range.

351
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,780
<i>Fly deeper into Chig territory.</i>

352
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,340
More than 56 seconds
will take us right into the comet.

353
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,900
Hey, we're gonna get
nailed by it anyway.

354
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,860
And the one thing is...

355
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,100
well, the primary one thing is...

356
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,180
the engine can't be fired
in its current position.

357
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:06,780
- So much for that.
- Well, we could try to manually adjust its position.

358
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,260
That would require an E.V.A.

359
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:12,420
We've only got one suit
with 15 minutes O2 supply.

360
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,900
- I'll do it.
- I've E.V.A.'d before.

361
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:18,820
- It's my idea.
- We don't know whose idea it was.

362
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,700
- Wang goes.
- Why Wang?

363
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,060
I have faith in him.

364
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:49,960
- I want you to have this, Paul.
- Nathan, I... I can't.

365
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,000
You all said it yourselves.

366
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,040
It means more than
just a photo tag now.

367
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,600
And you could use it.

368
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,800
Let's do it.

369
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,080
Twelve minutes.

370
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,680
The mechanism's jammed.

371
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,200
Eight minutes.

372
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,720
Oh, yes!

373
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,320
Hoo-rah!

374
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,960
I'd like to dispatch a Navy LC with
a squadron of SA-43s to the comet's region.

375
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:18,880
- You and I both know where that signal originated.
- It's an enemy transmission, sir.

376
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,880
Probably disinformation. They're aware
we're conducting a search and rescue.

377
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,040
That's why the fighter escort
for the rescue vehicles, sir.

378
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:33,080
Why doesn't one of us come out and say
what we're afraid these signals could be.

379
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:36,600
Setting up an ambush?

380
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,040
Presenting us with a gift.

381
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,240
I wouldn't bet on that.

382
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,120
But I do believe it is something
to go on toward finding the 58th.

383
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:58,440
Dispatch the LC and the 32nd Squadron
to comet Yanelli-Wimberly.

384
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:10,080
Comet... 72,000 kilometers and closing.

385
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:12,240
<i>Bearing 7-5-niner.</i>

386
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,680
Roger that.
Main port engine pressure is at 80%.

387
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,640
We are go for burn.

388
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,920
Reset the flight clock.

389
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,880
<i>- It's crucial we have a burn time of 56 seconds.
- Roger that.</i>

390
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,920
Less than that we miss it. More than that,
we're all gonna have a hell of a headache.

391
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,960
We're reissuing partial power here.
Telemetry and guidance are history.

392
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,840
This whole thing's off-line.
We're gonna have to fly manual.

393
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,640
Don't worry, I'll guide you.
Or anyway, the stars will.

394
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,600
Ninety seconds to burn.

395
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:52,960
Thirty-five mikes depletion
of N2/O2 supply.

396
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,360
Let's worry about that at two mikes.

397
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,440
Eighty seconds.

398
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,720
Seventy seconds.

399
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,640
<i>Sixty seconds.</i>

400
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:29,240
"And when I shall die, take him
and cut him out in little stars.

401
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,080
<i>"And he will make
the face of heaven so fine...</i>

402
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,080
<i>"that all the world will be
in love with night...</i>

403
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,760
<i>and pay no worship
to the garish sun."</i>

404
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,320
Thank you, Shane.

405
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,560
Forty seconds.

406
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,160
Okay, let's get lit.

407
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,560
<i>Thirty seconds to ignition.</i>

408
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,400
Yaw axis, 10 degrees...

409
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:10,080
pitch axis, 20... 24.

410
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,280
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

411
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,920
Ten seconds to burn.
Nine, eight...

412
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,160
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

413
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,760
<i>four, three, two, one, ignition!</i>

414
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,160
Steady.

415
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:42,040
Sixteen degrees.
Ten degrees.

416
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,880
Fifteen, 16, 17...

417
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,480
<i>18, 19...</i>

418
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,560
Come on.

419
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,080
All right, adjust two degrees
by one degree!

420
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,880
45, 46...

421
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,680
47, 48...

422
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
Main engine off.

423
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,240
It won't shut down!
We're over!

424
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,680
<i>Queen 6,
this is Lightning Bolts.</i>

425
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,600
<i>Approaching Yanelli-Wimberly.
No sign of enemy activity.</i>

426
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,560
Any sign of the 58th?

427
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,280
Nothing on the LIDAR.

428
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,280
Holy... I got a visual.

429
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,680
<i>I got an incredible visual.</i>

430
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,560
<i>Found 'em!</i>

431
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,000
<i>- Safe, huh?
- Yeah.</i>

432
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:13,720
Look, 'Phousse!
Out there!

433
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,200
An LC convoy.
They got us!

434
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,920
I though we were dead
when we burned too long.

435
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,160
Me too.

436
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,160
Until, of course, I saw
the actual elapsed burn time...

437
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,440
and then I knew we'd be all right.

438
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,760
Uh, I've never done this before, all right?
So I hope I got it right.

439
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:12,080
<i>Free tickets to
the Saratoga bowling alley.</i>

440
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,840
There's a shoe rental too.

441
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,720
Did I do it right?

442
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,600
Why is she...

443
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,640
Uh...
Hawkes.

444
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,880
Remember last week, we all went to
the lanes, everyone except Shane?

445
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,240
- Yeah.
- She thinks bowling's for dweebs.

446
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,520
Damn.

447
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,960
See, I got to remember that stuff.

448
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,920
She all ticked at me?

449
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,760
No, man.
You did good.

450
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
- You think so?
- Yeah.

451
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,640
<i>Hey!</i>

452
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,600
You ought to try some hooch.
It's pretty good.

453
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:13,400
<i>For some reason,
it reminds me of shaving.</i>

454
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,880
Oh, I... almost forgot.

455
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:33,560
- Merry Christmas, Paul.
- I don't deserve this.

456
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,760
When you talked about being a kid...

457
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,880
and knowing that the River of Stars
would always be there in the sky...

458
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,240
I knew you never lost your faith.

459
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,240
That's what it is.

460
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,280
Knowing something's always
gonna be there for you.

461
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,240
From all of us, sir.

462
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,200
Merry Christmas.

463
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:34,320
Looks like I got two gifts.

464
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,360
<i>Watch your hands. Watch your hands.</i>
