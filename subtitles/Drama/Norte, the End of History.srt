NORTE, THE END OF HISTORY

3
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:26,210
This is the new politics.

4
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:29,631
It's the new vision,
the new ideology.

5
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:32,675
The 21st century politics.

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,345
That's still postmodernism.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,891
That's just the genesis,
but it's more than post-modernism.

8
00:00:40,016 --> 00:00:43,061
How do you apply that, Fabian?
A la anarchy?

9
00:00:43,186 --> 00:00:47,023
No government.
Absolute freedom of the individual.

10
00:00:47,148 --> 00:00:48,316
That's old hat.

11
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:50,193
That's the ideal.

12
00:00:50,318 --> 00:00:53,863
But it's more than that.

13
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:58,076
Truth is dead. So is meaning.

14
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:02,955
Death of truth, death of meaning.
No more responsibility?

15
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,792
A different level of responsibility.

16
00:01:05,917 --> 00:01:09,379
A different level of application.
A different level of understanding.

17
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:10,880
What level is that?

18
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:14,300
It's beyond everything.

19
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:15,843
Define "everything".

20
00:01:20,014 --> 00:01:22,475
The destruction
of the myth of provenance.

21
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,310
Of origins.

22
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:25,770
Everything's kaput!

23
00:01:26,813 --> 00:01:27,855
Wow.

24
00:01:29,565 --> 00:01:31,693
Anti-anarchism.

25
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:33,695
Anti-existentialism.

26
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:35,405
Anti-God.

27
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,073
Anti-everything!

28
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,951
My God, Fabian,
you're a reactionary.

29
00:01:40,076 --> 00:01:43,246
Or maybe just a criminal.

30
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,249
- An instigator?
- No.

31
00:01:46,374 --> 00:01:48,668
You lack sleep, that's it. Like me.

32
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:50,628
No, you don't get me.

33
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:53,131
I don't lack sleep, okay?
And I'm not joking.

34
00:01:53,256 --> 00:02:00,430
The anarchist believes
in volunteerism and cooperativism.

35
00:02:00,555 --> 00:02:02,473
No force, no compulsion.

36
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,020
The existentialist is a free
and responsible individual

37
00:02:08,146 --> 00:02:14,318
whose genius
comes from his own abilities.

38
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,863
- The godly.
- No, wait, it's like this...

39
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:20,616
Okay.

40
00:02:20,742 --> 00:02:25,371
It's basically instinct
over intellect.

41
00:02:25,496 --> 00:02:32,628
The only reason for being
is the eradication of all elements

42
00:02:32,754 --> 00:02:34,881
that is a distraction to morality.

43
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:40,762
Or the destruction of anything
that is inimical to morality.

44
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:45,892
The distinction
between right and wrong is clear.

45
00:02:46,017 --> 00:02:49,562
But the wrong must be destroyed,
which is absolute.

46
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:55,777
That perspective is immoral.

47
00:02:55,902 --> 00:02:57,487
Very abstract.

48
00:02:57,612 --> 00:03:00,656
Everything that is absolute
is immoral.

49
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:05,328
What's absolute is the need
to destroy what's wrong.

50
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:10,374
What's "wrong"?

51
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,462
There are levels of morality,
Fabian.

52
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:16,923
And many arguments
about the issue of morality.

53
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:18,758
Then be primal.

54
00:03:18,883 --> 00:03:21,302
That's basic instinct.
Common sense.

55
00:03:21,427 --> 00:03:22,929
You know what is right from wrong.

56
00:03:23,054 --> 00:03:25,807
What is essential.
What is fundamental.

57
00:03:25,932 --> 00:03:30,019
Let's not rely on what those stupid
philosophers said.

58
00:03:30,144 --> 00:03:33,564
Reason and logic
are still important, Fabian.

59
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:34,941
Ethics.

60
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:37,985
Truth, or the pursuit of it,
remains essential.

61
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:42,865
Your so-called post-truth
is dangerous.

62
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:45,326
It's a return to the dark ages.

63
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:47,537
- Frightening.
- Barbaric.

64
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:51,082
No, it's not. You're just confused.

65
00:03:51,207 --> 00:03:53,292
You really confuse me.

66
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:57,255
- I need to sleep.
- It's still early.

67
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,632
She hasn't slept.

68
00:03:59,757 --> 00:04:01,467
A whole lot of paperwork's
last night.

69
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,890
What's the problem, Fabian Viduya?

70
00:04:10,768 --> 00:04:14,021
- I need to borrow money, sirs.
- There you go!

71
00:04:14,146 --> 00:04:16,524
- "Sir"?
- Ma'am, Ma'am!

72
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,778
- I'm broke.
- For a book. And my rent.

73
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:22,363
I'll pay you back.

74
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:24,740
- How much?
- Three thousand.

75
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:31,581
You're a hardcore capitalist now.

76
00:04:31,706 --> 00:04:35,585
- So? Capitalism is good.
- Capitalism is evil.

77
00:04:39,589 --> 00:04:41,883
Adam Smith won.

78
00:04:42,008 --> 00:04:44,635
Karl Marx shall return.
The fight's not over.

79
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:48,055
- Still hoping? Fuck them all.
- Fuck you, too.

80
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,182
That's crazy.

81
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:53,144
Anyway, you're a good payer.

82
00:04:53,269 --> 00:04:57,189
But your mind's messed up.
Come back to Law School.

83
00:04:57,315 --> 00:04:59,025
She's right, kid.

84
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,570
Come back to school.

85
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:05,031
Thanks for this.

86
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:15,249
Apparently this has been
the discourse of the hungry.

87
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:17,627
You're just borrowing money!

88
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:19,128
I'll pay back.

89
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:29,180
Perry, get an ambulance, hurry!

90
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:34,810
- What happened to her?
- So unfortunate.

91
00:05:34,936 --> 00:05:37,772
- I think she's already dead.
- She's dead?

92
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:44,445
- Wasn't she with somebody?
- Ambulance is coming.

93
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:49,033
- What happened to her?
- Did she have company?

94
00:09:56,614 --> 00:09:58,073
Little Sister,
get him from her arms.

95
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,993
She might be tired already.

96
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:07,249
Get down now, JR.

97
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:13,631
Merry Christmas to you, too.

98
00:10:31,357 --> 00:10:33,067
Careful, please.

99
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:46,789
Good grief!

100
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,645
Don't force it!

101
00:11:24,743 --> 00:11:26,996
Here we go.

102
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:30,309
Stop. Here.

103
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,776
- Beer.
- Let's go.

104
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,202
Beer.

105
00:13:32,871 --> 00:13:34,331
I'm sick of this thing.

106
00:13:37,876 --> 00:13:39,586
Fuck you!

107
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,380
"I'm sorry, the subscriber
you're trying to reach"

108
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:42,756
"is out of coverage area."

109
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:44,466
"Message sending failed."

110
00:13:46,385 --> 00:13:49,096
Why did you throw your phone away?
How will we reach you now?

111
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:51,723
Uh, I don't know. We'll see.

112
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,437
- You're a fool, Fabian.
- Fuck up, isn't it?

113
00:13:56,562 --> 00:13:59,440
- Let's go there, guys.
- Freedom!

114
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:01,608
- Let's go!
- You're such a wretch.

115
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:15,998
- Rizal was right.
- Why do you say that?

116
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:19,168
When he said that the youth
was the hope of the nation.

117
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:22,880
When he starts to age, that's it.
He's gonna make a turn-around.

118
00:14:23,005 --> 00:14:25,048
That's us, Filipinos.

119
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:29,553
As youths, we want to do so much.
We're capable of so much.

120
00:14:29,678 --> 00:14:32,389
But when you reach the age of 30,
40, that's it.

121
00:14:32,514 --> 00:14:37,102
- Everything's turned upside down.
- That's why he died young.

122
00:14:37,227 --> 00:14:38,604
No.

123
00:14:38,729 --> 00:14:43,525
He became great
because he died young.

124
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:47,738
Look at Bonifacio, Jacinto.

125
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:50,908
- EdJop!
- EdJop, right!

126
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:54,536
They did what they needed to do,
and then they died.

127
00:14:54,661 --> 00:14:56,580
If you outlive your prime, fuck.

128
00:14:56,705 --> 00:14:58,499
Your wretchedness
will catch up on you.

129
00:14:58,624 --> 00:15:01,418
Look at Aguinaldo.

130
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,504
Marcos. Who else?

131
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:06,465
Joseph Estrada.
Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.

132
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:09,218
They were blinded by long life.

133
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:13,597
That's the curse
of Philippine History.

134
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,933
And the oldies
do not have any other preoccupation

135
00:15:16,058 --> 00:15:19,228
except cleaning up the mess
that they made.

136
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,146
The fucking revisionists.

137
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:24,107
They're forcing
that Aguinaldo is a hero.

138
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,110
<i>Ad infinitum. Ad nauseum.</i>

139
00:15:27,236 --> 00:15:32,908
They're claiming that Bonifacio
and Luna are traitors.

140
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:36,745
It's nauseating
how they revise history like that.

141
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,039
What's disgusting
is how the nation is mum about it.

142
00:15:39,164 --> 00:15:42,376
And the silence
of the so-called historians.

143
00:15:42,501 --> 00:15:45,587
The intellectuals,
academicians, artists.

144
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:47,923
Fuck, you're all part of that.

145
00:15:49,383 --> 00:15:51,134
And how about you, Fabian?

146
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,304
Have you done anything
to fight their revisionist shit?

147
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,140
You just threw away your phone!

148
00:15:57,266 --> 00:16:00,852
Haven't you wondered why up to now,
it's the 21st century, man,

149
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:06,817
Aguinaldo's still not been charged
with killing Bonifacio and Luna?

150
00:16:06,942 --> 00:16:11,321
In law school,
all we did was memorized laws,

151
00:16:11,446 --> 00:16:14,908
discourse about justice,

152
00:16:15,033 --> 00:16:20,664
but we can't face the biggest crime
and truth about our history!

153
00:16:20,789 --> 00:16:23,333
That's right. At some point
in our country's fucked-up history,

154
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,918
it needs to be resolved.

155
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:27,504
At this point,
that's difficult to resolve.

156
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:28,797
For what?

157
00:16:28,922 --> 00:16:32,676
We are at that point
where no one owns history anymore.

158
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:34,261
We make up our own histories.

159
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:38,015
- What now?
- Right.

160
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,850
Fuck jurisprudence.

161
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:41,810
Fuck jurisprudence!

162
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:45,439
Why are we still studying law?

163
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:50,152
Are we just going to
leave it like that?

164
00:16:50,277 --> 00:16:51,612
What's the point?

165
00:16:51,737 --> 00:16:57,326
Where's the pursuit of truth
and justice?

166
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,785
- Hey, hey.
- What?

167
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:01,246
Pursuit of truth and justice?

168
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,290
According to Professors Moira
and Perry,

169
00:17:03,415 --> 00:17:06,793
you said that truth
and justice are dead.

170
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,421
What are you saying now?

171
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:10,797
Nothing.

172
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,758
No. I was just playing with them.

173
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:17,929
Our professors
have become so complacent.

174
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:19,806
<i>Deus ex machina.</i>

175
00:17:19,931 --> 00:17:24,811
That's needed in Aguinaldo's plot
to kill Bonifacio and Luna.

176
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:30,025
- And why, sir, may I ask?
- Listen.

177
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,277
It's like a commercial film.

178
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:36,323
Divine intervention. Happy ending.

179
00:17:36,448 --> 00:17:40,494
Bonifacio, Luna,
and Aguinaldo share one mother.

180
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:48,251
At the end, an old woman
will descend from the clouds,

181
00:17:48,377 --> 00:17:53,590
with matching long hair, long gown,
and maybe long teeth.

182
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,302
She's wearing all white.

183
00:17:57,427 --> 00:18:04,351
And she'll say,
"Bonifacio and Luna, my children."

184
00:18:04,476 --> 00:18:06,561
"Forgive your brother, Aguinaldo."

185
00:18:08,146 --> 00:18:12,567
"He's just too jealous, too stupid."

186
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:14,778
"He can't even read in Spanish."

187
00:18:15,946 --> 00:18:17,614
"But he's handsome, right?"

188
00:18:20,075 --> 00:18:22,703
Don't sweat it, dear friends.
Why torture yourselves?

189
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:28,458
I almost cried, Ferdie, you bastard!

190
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,839
You should have just been
a film director.

191
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:38,552
I'm not kidding.
That's how our culture is, right?

192
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:40,554
We leave it all up to God.

193
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:42,389
To divine justice.

194
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,102
- Oh, well, let's drink to that!
- Amen to that!

195
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:50,272
<i>Jurisprudence, Edgar.
Deus ex mod.</i>

196
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:53,734
- Go ahead.
- Get some beer.

197
00:19:11,543 --> 00:19:17,841
Do you know how to drive?
You drunk?

198
00:19:17,966 --> 00:19:20,844
- Okay, I'll go ahead.
- Take care.

199
00:19:26,391 --> 00:19:27,684
Thank you. Thank you.

200
00:19:31,897 --> 00:19:34,274
- So...
- So?

201
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:38,320
<i>- Dura lex, sed lex.
- Fuck you!</i>

202
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:41,948
You should go back to law school.

203
00:19:42,073 --> 00:19:46,036
Yes, come back. Just one more year.

204
00:19:46,161 --> 00:19:48,789
Man, don't forget my offer.
Work at the office.

205
00:19:48,914 --> 00:19:52,918
Just proofread.
You'll be with Gina.

206
00:19:53,043 --> 00:19:55,462
You'll make thrice
than what you earn at the café.

207
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:59,090
You can't pirate
the Employee of the Year!

208
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:03,345
- I'll go now. Bye!
- Take care!

209
00:21:07,492 --> 00:21:09,661
Eat.

210
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:13,248
I keep giving you food
and you're still not eating.

211
00:21:26,177 --> 00:21:28,013
You'll be sold soon.

212
00:21:28,138 --> 00:21:30,390
She's gonna be sold?

213
00:21:35,312 --> 00:21:36,354
Yes.

214
00:21:38,106 --> 00:21:41,026
And they'll butcher her.

215
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:44,529
And then eat her.

216
00:21:58,168 --> 00:22:01,046
Mama, are we selling the pig?

217
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:06,092
Yes. We need the money.

218
00:22:06,217 --> 00:22:11,056
Will it be butchered
like Auntie Ading said?

219
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,478
That is the fate of the pig.

220
00:22:19,272 --> 00:22:21,858
Go outside.
You might get burned by the oil.

221
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:21,251
Let's eat?
The kids are already eating.

222
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:22,419
Later.

223
00:23:26,923 --> 00:23:28,133
Eat some more.

224
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,222
Where's JR?

225
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:37,308
He doesn't want to eat yet.

226
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:43,690
Start eating, Big Sister.

227
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,405
Want more vegetables?

228
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:00,081
Ading, once you're done,
go to Magda.

229
00:24:01,374 --> 00:24:06,838
Ask her if she wants to buy
the utensils for our eatery.

230
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:11,176
Tell her they're brand new, okay?
Offer it at half the price.

231
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,015
We won't push through
with our eatery, Ate?

232
00:24:19,517 --> 00:24:20,560
Maybe later on.

233
00:24:24,355 --> 00:24:29,527
- Let's eat, Ate. Vegetables?
- I'll go wait for your big brother.

234
00:24:32,197 --> 00:24:33,698
Where is JR?

235
00:24:35,033 --> 00:24:37,202
JR.

236
00:24:37,327 --> 00:24:38,369
Here, Ma'am.

237
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,207
Open it.

238
00:25:11,277 --> 00:25:14,155
The roofing and the wood
are outside.

239
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,116
The pig's at the back.

240
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:26,209
Hey, Joaquin. How are you doing?

241
00:25:26,334 --> 00:25:28,128
Feeling better, ma'am.

242
00:25:30,046 --> 00:25:32,799
This one? Good grief!

243
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,138
This is so poorly made.

244
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:41,099
You were going to make a roof
out of this?

245
00:25:41,224 --> 00:25:42,559
Jesus!

246
00:25:42,684 --> 00:25:48,314
It's not water-proof
and it's a fire hazard as well!

247
00:25:48,439 --> 00:25:50,525
It's temporary.

248
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:53,486
When we have enough to replace it.

249
00:25:53,611 --> 00:25:55,989
- Where is the pig?
- Back there.

250
00:26:12,297 --> 00:26:13,715
What do you feed it?

251
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,177
- Water spinach.
- And rice bran.

252
00:26:17,302 --> 00:26:21,055
Good grief.
You should've given it feeds.

253
00:26:21,181 --> 00:26:23,391
It'll be bigger, heavier.

254
00:26:23,516 --> 00:26:28,021
Because you opted to be cheap,
you lose!

255
00:26:28,146 --> 00:26:29,647
We don't have money.

256
00:26:31,566 --> 00:26:35,195
Miss Magda,
if you need a laundry woman,

257
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,322
Ading and I are available.

258
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:39,741
I already have a laundry woman.
Tating.

259
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,868
We use a washing machine.

260
00:28:15,003 --> 00:28:16,170
There.

261
00:28:18,423 --> 00:28:20,216
Count it.

262
00:28:20,341 --> 00:28:22,844
I deducted half of what you owe me.

263
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,765
Thanks.

264
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,525
Hello. Tating.

265
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:40,695
Come to Eliza's house.

266
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,157
Bring your husband. Yes.

267
00:28:44,282 --> 00:28:47,285
Hurry, I have to go.

268
00:28:58,212 --> 00:28:59,464
Son of a bitch!

269
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:04,302
Fuck you, don't kick it!

270
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:47,637
Why did you turn it off?

271
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:52,934
Beer?

272
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,611
Cool place you have here.

273
00:30:03,736 --> 00:30:07,949
Very Japanese.

274
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,118
I'm simplifying everything now.

275
00:30:12,245 --> 00:30:13,955
The Japanese...

276
00:30:15,706 --> 00:30:17,083
...they have that...

277
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:24,006
...classic sense of exactness
in everything they do.

278
00:30:24,132 --> 00:30:26,092
They're great.

279
00:30:26,217 --> 00:30:30,054
The haiku for example.
Five, seven, five. Perfect.

280
00:30:32,223 --> 00:30:35,476
So smart.

281
00:30:38,062 --> 00:30:39,439
It's great hanging out here.

282
00:30:39,564 --> 00:30:44,610
Full of wisdom and knowledge.

283
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,953
You're brave.

284
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:59,333
You want us to stop?

285
00:31:01,669 --> 00:31:02,712
I don't know.

286
00:31:05,298 --> 00:31:07,508
I love the sex, sure, but...

287
00:31:10,678 --> 00:31:11,804
...the betrayal.

288
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,975
I don't know.

289
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,227
Kiko and I have been friends
for a long time.

290
00:31:28,196 --> 00:31:32,158
No one has to know.
We'll keep it a secret.

291
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:33,784
We'll be careful.

292
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:42,627
You know, it's hard to pretend
when you're with them.

293
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:45,671
Can you?

294
00:31:48,466 --> 00:31:50,259
We just really have to be careful.

295
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:53,888
It'll be our secret.

296
00:32:04,607 --> 00:32:06,901
What if I ask you
not to come back here again?

297
00:32:11,364 --> 00:32:15,243
- You still want this though?
- Of course.

298
00:32:15,368 --> 00:32:18,412
But not here.

299
00:32:19,622 --> 00:32:20,665
Okay.

300
00:32:21,791 --> 00:32:24,001
Don't worry,
I won't come here again.

301
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:31,259
I only wanted to see the intestine
of an intelligent person like you.

302
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,637
There's nothing to see.

303
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:38,558
Nothing but pretensions.

304
00:32:42,395 --> 00:32:43,854
I want to be like you.

305
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:48,901
Maybe someday
I'll be able to catch up.

306
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:54,949
You're young. Relax.

307
00:33:08,713 --> 00:33:11,799
If you don't mind,
what happened to you and Gina?

308
00:33:11,924 --> 00:33:15,720
You looked so good together.
In fact you started to look alike.

309
00:33:25,563 --> 00:33:26,606
I don't know.

310
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:32,153
She's your opposite. Yes.

311
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,532
She said she's tired of brains.
Nothing but mind-fuck, she said.

312
00:33:38,534 --> 00:33:41,078
She doesn't like brains fucking her,
so there.

313
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,917
She left me
for someone who's handsome,

314
00:33:47,043 --> 00:33:48,419
reeks of perfume.

315
00:33:50,171 --> 00:33:52,757
And wears a jacket at midday.

316
00:33:52,882 --> 00:33:56,010
Gigolo. Stuntman.

317
00:33:58,596 --> 00:33:59,930
Her choice.

318
00:34:08,939 --> 00:34:10,775
You're not really just a mind-fuck.

319
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:15,571
You're actually good.

320
00:34:28,209 --> 00:34:29,794
How about Kiko's job offer?

321
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:49,146
What's the dog's name?

322
00:35:06,497 --> 00:35:10,501
The masses
never really created history.

323
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:13,295
There's always someone
who determines it.

324
00:35:13,421 --> 00:35:16,674
He'll drive you to what he wants
and how it should be done.

325
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:18,634
And the masses would listen.

326
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:23,097
Here in the Philippines,
no Filipino ever really succeeded.

327
00:35:23,222 --> 00:35:27,977
It's always know-it-alls,
who fail,

328
00:35:28,102 --> 00:35:30,938
get betrayed and then hanged.

329
00:35:32,481 --> 00:35:37,319
What we really need
is someone who's clean,

330
00:35:37,445 --> 00:35:40,114
will do the deed clean.

331
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,365
No hassles.

332
00:35:43,075 --> 00:35:47,037
The way you describe the revolution,
it sounds like a crime.

333
00:35:47,163 --> 00:35:49,915
Just like robbing
or killing someone.

334
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,376
Well, if you're doing a revolution,

335
00:35:52,501 --> 00:35:55,004
you should have the guts
to kill a person.

336
00:35:55,129 --> 00:35:58,549
The revolution devours its own.

337
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:01,302
It's always
the revolution's tragedy.

338
00:36:01,427 --> 00:36:04,472
Aguinaldo, Bonifacio, Luna.

339
00:36:04,597 --> 00:36:06,974
Trotsky, Stalin, Lenin.

340
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:12,271
Whatever happened to the revolution
of the leftists here?

341
00:36:12,396 --> 00:36:16,484
Can they say the Cuban revolution
had been successful?

342
00:36:16,609 --> 00:36:20,821
- Yes and no.
- I don't think so.

343
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:25,618
Then we can actually conclude now
that the only valid revolution is...

344
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,536
...The Beatles Revolution!

345
00:36:29,163 --> 00:36:30,456
There you go.

346
00:36:32,041 --> 00:36:33,793
Wait, wait, wait.

347
00:36:33,918 --> 00:36:36,754
Wait, wait. Listen.

348
00:36:36,879 --> 00:36:39,757
"Surigao cult
blames corruption for delay".

349
00:36:39,882 --> 00:36:44,637
Surigao City,
call it post-doomsday recrimination.

350
00:36:44,762 --> 00:36:47,723
"A cult leader in Surigao del Norte
province on Friday"

351
00:36:47,848 --> 00:36:50,017
"blamed corrupt government leaders"

352
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:53,854
"for the delayed coming
of their "Divine Government,"

353
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:57,441
"even as members of the Ecleo
family of Dinagat Islands,"

354
00:36:57,566 --> 00:37:02,571
"who controls the Philippine
Benevolent Missionary Association"

355
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:06,200
"are locked
in a doomsday-related tit for tat."

356
00:37:06,325 --> 00:37:08,244
"The temporal government
has not yet surrendered."

357
00:37:08,369 --> 00:37:09,912
"It is perpetuating--"

358
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:14,333
"It is perpetuating
its lies to mankind,"

359
00:37:14,458 --> 00:37:16,418
"said Berano Tamayo, 60,"

360
00:37:16,544 --> 00:37:21,006
"of the self-styled quasi-military
and quasi-religious organization,"

361
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:23,259
"High-World, H-World."

362
00:37:23,384 --> 00:37:27,263
"Tamayo's group began converging
on a hill overlooking Lipata Port"

363
00:37:27,388 --> 00:37:30,641
"in preparation for the beginning
of what they believed"

364
00:37:30,766 --> 00:37:32,977
"would be the end
of the temporal world"

365
00:37:33,102 --> 00:37:37,731
"and the beginning of the spiritual
reign on earth of their deity."

366
00:37:37,857 --> 00:37:40,568
A spiritual revolution!

367
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:41,861
"Not earth-shaking."

368
00:37:41,986 --> 00:37:47,199
"He clarified, however,
that the December 21 prediction,"

369
00:37:47,324 --> 00:37:49,869
"coinciding with the
ending of the Mayan calendar,"

370
00:37:49,994 --> 00:37:51,620
"did not originate from the group,"

371
00:37:51,745 --> 00:37:53,539
"and that they interpreted the date"

372
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:55,708
"not as a definitive date
for doomsday,"

373
00:37:55,833 --> 00:37:58,627
"but as a marker of sorts
for the coming of their deity."

374
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:02,840
Fucking shitheads!

375
00:38:02,965 --> 00:38:04,800
'I did not say it would be--'

376
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:08,637
'I did not say it would be
an earth-shaking event.'

377
00:38:08,762 --> 00:38:11,223
'I said it is the day
when darkness begins to reign'

378
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:12,892
'in the hearts of men'

379
00:38:13,017 --> 00:38:17,146
'because of wanton perversions
and vices,'

380
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:20,399
"said Tamayo, when the Inquirer
asked him again on Friday."

381
00:38:20,524 --> 00:38:23,277
'Isn't the world
in a corrupted state as we speak?',

382
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:25,696
"he added in an apparent suggestion"

383
00:38:25,821 --> 00:38:27,239
"that somehow,"

384
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:30,576
"the group has predicted the coming
of their Divine Government."

385
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:04,920
- Criselle, what are you doing?
- I'm doing my assignments.

386
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:09,008
That is my table.

387
00:40:09,133 --> 00:40:13,804
<i>Pamulinawen, listen to my heart</i>

388
00:40:13,929 --> 00:40:17,099
<i>- The one who's begging you
- Okay, okay.</i>

389
00:40:17,224 --> 00:40:19,852
- Go to your room.
- Yes, Ma.

390
00:40:19,977 --> 00:40:22,771
- And go change your clothes.
- Yes, Ma.

391
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:26,734
Fabian.

392
00:40:31,864 --> 00:40:36,243
- That'd be 2,500 upon return.
- I thought this'd be five-six?

393
00:40:36,368 --> 00:40:38,454
Then go to an Indian instead.

394
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:41,290
- It used to be--
- It takes you so long to pay me!

395
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,922
- So?
- My ATM card's with you, right?

396
00:40:49,048 --> 00:40:52,760
What good is this when it's empty?

397
00:40:54,136 --> 00:40:57,765
- Will I take that money back then?
- No, thanks.

398
00:41:03,145 --> 00:41:04,188
Really?

399
00:41:07,107 --> 00:41:08,275
It goes smoothly now.

400
00:41:12,613 --> 00:41:14,948
Sorry. Go on, Perry. Continue.

401
00:41:16,075 --> 00:41:20,245
As I was saying,
I didn't tell anyone.

402
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:24,500
Not even to my wife and kids.

403
00:41:24,625 --> 00:41:26,210
I kept it to myself.

404
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:31,256
Each morning

405
00:41:31,381 --> 00:41:35,886
I woke up to an excruciating pain
in my stomach.

406
00:41:36,011 --> 00:41:39,765
There was blood in my shit.

407
00:41:42,893 --> 00:41:45,771
I thought I was dying.

408
00:41:45,896 --> 00:41:48,315
- Why didn't you have a check-up?
- No.

409
00:41:49,483 --> 00:41:50,943
I didn't want to know.

410
00:41:54,488 --> 00:41:57,407
But one day, I don't know.

411
00:41:57,533 --> 00:42:00,202
Out of desperation, maybe.

412
00:42:02,246 --> 00:42:03,372
Curiosity.

413
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,880
I ate bitter melon. Freshly picked.

414
00:42:13,966 --> 00:42:16,468
My kids grew them in the garden.

415
00:42:16,593 --> 00:42:22,141
I picked one, cooked it,
with lots of tomatoes and chillies.

416
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:30,232
I had it for breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

417
00:42:33,277 --> 00:42:35,154
On the sixth day...

418
00:42:38,448 --> 00:42:42,119
...the bleeding stopped,
so did the stomach aches.

419
00:42:42,244 --> 00:42:43,704
I felt light.

420
00:42:45,122 --> 00:42:49,126
Is that what you call healing?

421
00:42:49,251 --> 00:42:53,505
On the sixth day he rose again?
Wow, bitter melon!

422
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,716
The chillies did it,
not the bitter melon.

423
00:42:56,884 --> 00:42:59,595
- No, I think it's the bitter melon.
- It was the bitter melon.

424
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,766
There are many myths
about the bitter melon.

425
00:43:04,892 --> 00:43:07,728
Chilli-pepper is the number one food
for the brain, right?

426
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:10,731
No, no, no.

427
00:43:12,274 --> 00:43:18,197
It was the bitter melon, man.

428
00:43:18,322 --> 00:43:23,327
Fabian, bitter melon saved my life.

429
00:43:23,452 --> 00:43:30,209
And a modern-day vigilante
like Fabian will save the country.

430
00:43:30,334 --> 00:43:31,543
The world, I mean.

431
00:43:31,668 --> 00:43:35,088
If we really want to clean up
the society,

432
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:37,591
the solution is simple.

433
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39,509
Kill all the bad elements.

434
00:43:41,303 --> 00:43:45,474
If there's a molesting priest,
kill him immediately.

435
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,977
A corrupt policeman? Kill him.

436
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:52,314
An abusive husband? Kill him.

437
00:43:52,439 --> 00:43:55,067
That is worse than fundamentalism.

438
00:43:57,611 --> 00:44:03,617
Fabian, you are the brightest
student in our class.

439
00:44:03,742 --> 00:44:05,953
What happened?

440
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:08,121
I agree, Fabian. What happened?

441
00:44:09,206 --> 00:44:10,582
I don't know.

442
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,919
I'm just uneasy
with what's happening.

443
00:44:14,044 --> 00:44:15,671
The world is so dumb.

444
00:44:17,547 --> 00:44:19,758
How can I be at peace
with the world's shallowness?

445
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:22,386
Look at you, you're so intelligent.
What happened?

446
00:44:26,348 --> 00:44:29,309
Let's go back
to bitter melons, Perry.

447
00:44:30,978 --> 00:44:32,187
Wait up.

448
00:44:34,564 --> 00:44:39,027
Here, I compiled this for you.

449
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:45,867
Why would you read Derek Parfit?

450
00:44:45,993 --> 00:44:47,327
Nothing, I'll just read him.

451
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:53,041
- I have to go.
- There's still plenty beer.

452
00:44:54,293 --> 00:44:56,086
No, I'm okay.

453
00:44:59,965 --> 00:45:01,216
Sir, thank you for this.

454
00:45:01,341 --> 00:45:05,429
Law School is missing you.
Come back.

455
00:45:20,944 --> 00:45:25,782
No jeweller in their right mind
will pay five hundred for this.

456
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:32,331
I inherited it from my father.
It's old.

457
00:45:33,457 --> 00:45:37,336
Inheritance has nothing to do
with price.

458
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:41,214
Even antiques can be worthless.

459
00:45:43,717 --> 00:45:48,347
All right. Five Hundred.
But I'll deduct your loan from it.

460
00:45:53,685 --> 00:45:54,728
So?

461
00:46:00,275 --> 00:46:03,278
I'm okay with five hundred.

462
00:46:03,403 --> 00:46:09,785
But can you please not deduct
from our loan yet?

463
00:46:11,703 --> 00:46:15,457
That wasn't the deal, Eliza.

464
00:46:15,582 --> 00:46:16,750
Let me remind you.

465
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:19,586
When Joaquin was fighting
for his life, who did you run to?

466
00:46:19,711 --> 00:46:20,921
Me.

467
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:22,631
And I didn't give you a hard time.

468
00:46:22,756 --> 00:46:24,800
A loan is a loan.

469
00:46:24,925 --> 00:46:26,301
Pay up!

470
00:46:28,011 --> 00:46:30,180
Not to rub it in,

471
00:46:30,305 --> 00:46:35,268
but your husband
owes his life to me.

472
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:42,275
Now what?

473
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:58,625
Tating, bring me 250.

474
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:18,562
Thank you.

475
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,209
DVD, Ma'am?

476
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:10,048
May I sit here for a while,
Grandpa?

477
00:49:10,173 --> 00:49:11,216
Yes, you may.

478
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,391
How are you doing, Joaquin?

479
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:24,896
I'm feeling better now, Grandpa.

480
00:49:25,021 --> 00:49:28,608
I'm starting to move around.

481
00:49:41,913 --> 00:49:45,292
Careful, son.
That's already your second life.

482
00:49:55,427 --> 00:50:01,308
Or at least majority of the people
in our society should be educated.

483
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,518
Isn't that what Rizal wanted for us?

484
00:50:03,643 --> 00:50:06,104
But how? When?

485
00:50:07,689 --> 00:50:10,650
Nothing's happened yet.
Nothing's working.

486
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:14,821
But even the dictatorship back then
didn't work.

487
00:50:14,946 --> 00:50:18,825
It's because Marcos softened.

488
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,954
He said Martial Law
wouldn't take long.

489
00:50:23,079 --> 00:50:25,665
And that he'll give back
our democracy.

490
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,918
What he did
was democratize corruption.

491
00:50:29,044 --> 00:50:31,713
It wasn't anymore just him,
but a bunch of them.

492
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,134
- Share the love!
- Nah, his conscience got to him.

493
00:50:36,259 --> 00:50:38,595
That started his downfall.

494
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,430
And then what did he do?

495
00:50:40,555 --> 00:50:43,892
He called for a snap election.
And that started his downfall.

496
00:50:44,017 --> 00:50:49,356
But in the beginning,
he had everyone killed.

497
00:50:49,481 --> 00:50:52,275
Everyone who was a nuisance.
He did it well, too.

498
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,027
Machiavelli's out of fashion.

499
00:50:54,152 --> 00:50:56,404
Those fucking mall
and cell phone moguls,

500
00:50:56,529 --> 00:50:59,157
you don't think
they idolize Machiavelli?

501
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:02,327
If I introduced Machiavelli
to my fucking usurer,

502
00:51:02,452 --> 00:51:03,995
they'd surely be friends.

503
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:05,789
Then let's kill them all!

504
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:11,378
Okay, let's say they're dead.

505
00:51:11,503 --> 00:51:14,381
But aren't we all talk?

506
00:51:14,506 --> 00:51:17,217
Because we all know
it's against the law.

507
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:23,348
That's what's stopping us from
pursuing our crazy philosophies.

508
00:51:23,473 --> 00:51:24,849
Speak for yourself.

509
00:51:26,643 --> 00:51:30,188
All of us are hypocrites anyway,
until we do something about it.

510
00:51:30,313 --> 00:51:33,108
That's the point.
Even the educated can be hypocrites.

511
00:51:33,233 --> 00:51:35,985
They lie to themselves. Cowards.

512
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,280
So, there.

513
00:51:39,406 --> 00:51:41,991
So, that's what I'm after.
Let's change that.

514
00:51:42,117 --> 00:51:45,745
Don't you ever think of punching
our regular customer in the café!

515
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:51,459
I was once a coward,
but now I will face the truth.

516
00:51:51,584 --> 00:51:56,005
Because all lies will be exposed.

517
00:51:56,131 --> 00:51:57,924
Right, Gina?

518
00:52:00,927 --> 00:52:05,140
- Why Gina?
- Ask her.

519
00:52:05,265 --> 00:52:07,767
It depends
on the loyalty of a person.

520
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,811
Question is, who am I loyal to.

521
00:52:09,936 --> 00:52:14,149
My friend
or his cheating girlfriend?

522
00:52:14,274 --> 00:52:15,358
Wait.

523
00:52:17,235 --> 00:52:19,154
What?

524
00:52:19,279 --> 00:52:22,574
Your girlfriend
wants to fuck us both.

525
00:52:22,699 --> 00:52:25,910
Don't you noticed she is turned on
by our discussions?

526
00:52:34,169 --> 00:52:35,211
Gina!

527
00:52:37,797 --> 00:52:39,466
Come back here!

528
00:52:45,889 --> 00:52:47,015
That was solid.

529
00:52:48,224 --> 00:52:50,643
There!
That's what I was talking about.

530
00:52:51,728 --> 00:52:52,979
Fuck, Fabian.

531
00:52:54,731 --> 00:52:56,900
If you become President,
I'll go underground.

532
00:53:15,919 --> 00:53:17,587
Ma'am Magda?

533
00:53:22,091 --> 00:53:23,927
Ma'am Magda?

534
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:29,974
Ma'am Magda?

535
00:53:33,353 --> 00:53:35,688
Ma'am Magda?

536
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,195
Ma'am Magda?

537
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:46,908
Ma'am Magda?

538
00:53:48,952 --> 00:53:52,455
What the hell, Bing?
You're disturbing us!

539
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:55,583
What's this?

540
00:53:55,708 --> 00:54:00,505
Same junk as before.
No one will buy that crap.

541
00:54:00,630 --> 00:54:04,259
Please, I'll take any price.

542
00:54:04,384 --> 00:54:07,345
I need the money. Have pity.

543
00:55:42,649 --> 00:55:43,858
Thank you, sir.

544
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:55,620
If only I had the money, man.
I wouldn't even think twice.

545
00:55:55,745 --> 00:55:58,998
But I'm really broke.

546
00:56:04,379 --> 00:56:06,798
I'm feeling sorry for Eliza.

547
00:56:08,383 --> 00:56:11,135
That ring is important to her.

548
00:56:12,595 --> 00:56:16,224
I know how hard it was
for her to pawn it.

549
00:56:18,601 --> 00:56:22,897
I must get it back for her.
We've only a week to pay for it.

550
00:56:23,022 --> 00:56:25,608
I won't rest until I've redeemed it.

551
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:30,071
Didn't she bring it
to Magda herself?

552
00:56:31,531 --> 00:56:33,449
Yes, she sacrificed it.

553
00:56:35,368 --> 00:56:37,620
She's sacrificed a lot
for us already.

554
00:56:41,374 --> 00:56:44,002
Even the capital for our eatery.

555
00:56:44,127 --> 00:56:47,171
Now it looks like
it won't push through.

556
00:56:48,214 --> 00:56:51,134
It's all gone.
Everything's with Madga.

557
00:56:58,266 --> 00:57:00,351
How's your leg anyway?

558
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:06,774
The doctor said two more months
before it heals completely.

559
00:57:06,899 --> 00:57:09,402
But I think I can work again.

560
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:14,032
Join us in Batac.
There's work for you.

561
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:18,161
Just mix cement. It's for sure.

562
00:57:21,164 --> 00:57:25,877
- I'll ask Eliza.
- I hope she agrees.

563
00:57:28,046 --> 00:57:29,213
Don't let it pass.

564
00:58:10,713 --> 00:58:14,133
Take these back
to your Maranao friends!

565
00:58:14,258 --> 00:58:17,345
These are quite sellable,
Ma'am Magda.

566
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,015
We had an agreement, Joaquin!

567
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:27,980
- I just want to get the ring.
- Can you pay for it?

568
00:58:30,024 --> 00:58:32,235
I'm offering you these DVDs, ma'am.

569
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:35,696
These are worth much more
than what you gave Eliza.

570
00:58:35,822 --> 00:58:39,492
For Christ's sake! Are you mad?

571
00:58:39,617 --> 00:58:43,454
You think I'll take these DVDs
as payment?

572
00:58:43,579 --> 00:58:49,168
That's why I'm begging you,
please give me back the ring.

573
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:52,547
Come back
when you've money to pay.

574
00:58:52,672 --> 00:58:54,966
Only until 12:00.

575
00:58:55,091 --> 00:58:59,512
If you don't, the ring is mine.

576
00:58:59,637 --> 00:59:00,680
Is that clear?

577
00:59:02,348 --> 00:59:05,184
Please, just this once, ma'am.

578
00:59:05,309 --> 00:59:07,186
Don't do this to me, Joaquin.

579
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:09,981
It's not what we agreed on.

580
00:59:14,026 --> 00:59:16,154
- Bastard!
- Give me back the ring!

581
00:59:16,279 --> 00:59:17,780
Bastard!

582
00:59:19,949 --> 00:59:21,909
Joaquin, no!

583
00:59:25,037 --> 00:59:27,790
Tating! Quick!

584
00:59:27,915 --> 00:59:30,751
Go to the authorities! You animal!

585
00:59:30,877 --> 00:59:34,672
Hurry! Call the police!

586
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:39,510
- You animal!
- Police!

587
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:14,670
What happened?

588
01:00:16,339 --> 01:00:19,508
If she doesn't return it,
she'll get it from me.

589
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:21,052
Where will you go?

590
01:01:45,011 --> 01:01:48,222
There you are.
I've been looking for you.

591
01:01:48,347 --> 01:01:49,557
Here, eat.

592
01:01:49,682 --> 01:01:52,435
There's more food downstairs.
Don't be shy.

593
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:54,103
- Thanks, man.
- You okay?

594
01:01:55,271 --> 01:01:56,314
Bye.

595
01:02:20,421 --> 01:02:25,051
<i>Pamulinawen, listen to my heart</i>

596
01:02:25,176 --> 01:02:27,970
- Criselle, my child.
- Yes, Ma?

597
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:31,682
- Go to sleep now.
- Yes, Ma.

598
01:02:31,807 --> 01:02:34,352
- Goodnight, Mommy!
- Goodnight.

599
01:03:25,736 --> 01:03:27,488
Wait.

600
01:03:27,613 --> 01:03:31,826
- Fabian.
- I'd like to pay you, Ma'am.

601
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:40,960
Sit down.
I'll just get your ATM card.

602
01:14:28,774 --> 01:14:29,816
Move.

603
01:15:34,256 --> 01:15:37,259
Fabian? Are you there?

604
01:15:39,845 --> 01:15:40,971
Open the door.

605
01:15:42,514 --> 01:15:43,682
Let's talk.

606
01:15:47,269 --> 01:15:48,311
Fabian?

607
01:15:51,148 --> 01:15:52,357
Let's talk!

608
01:15:59,865 --> 01:16:02,784
Open this, let's talk.

609
01:16:04,244 --> 01:16:06,288
Fabian!

610
01:16:11,042 --> 01:16:12,085
What's wrong?

611
01:16:13,211 --> 01:16:18,008
It's Kiko.
He wanted to challenge you.

612
01:16:18,133 --> 01:16:23,013
- To what?
- To a fist fight.

613
01:16:23,138 --> 01:16:24,389
Over Gina.

614
01:16:24,514 --> 01:16:27,559
Now? Is he around?
We can use knives instead!

615
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:31,188
Man, what's happening to you?

616
01:16:31,313 --> 01:16:33,523
You take our discourses
too seriously.

617
01:16:33,648 --> 01:16:36,985
The discussions. Just be cool.

618
01:16:38,111 --> 01:16:40,113
Come on, let's drink
and talk it over.

619
01:16:40,238 --> 01:16:41,281
What?

620
01:16:42,824 --> 01:16:44,326
Your anger with the world.

621
01:16:45,327 --> 01:16:49,206
Fabian, we're friends!
Why include us?

622
01:16:53,251 --> 01:16:55,629
- We're a team, right?
- Leave me alone.

623
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,175
We'll wait for you.

624
01:17:12,020 --> 01:17:15,440
Patch this up now, guys.
It's just a girl.

625
01:17:27,369 --> 01:17:31,456
We're all even now.

626
01:17:31,581 --> 01:17:33,083
We all don't have girlfriends.

627
01:17:35,377 --> 01:17:36,378
Peace?

628
01:17:48,807 --> 01:17:51,601
We're all equal now!

629
01:17:55,272 --> 01:17:56,731
We're not equal.

630
01:17:59,985 --> 01:18:02,070
Fabian, what's this drama all about?

631
01:18:03,697 --> 01:18:07,325
- I can't go back there.
- I can't understand you anymore.

632
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:11,246
What I'm saying
is we're no longer friends.

633
01:18:11,371 --> 01:18:12,664
I'm ending this.

634
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:16,793
I will face this alone.

635
01:18:20,422 --> 01:18:21,423
Enough.

636
01:18:29,055 --> 01:18:30,432
I told you he's nuts.

637
01:20:56,286 --> 01:20:58,371
You were moaning loudly, man.

638
01:21:01,624 --> 01:21:04,836
I keep dreaming about home.

639
01:21:07,380 --> 01:21:08,715
My wife and children.

640
01:21:10,550 --> 01:21:13,595
My mother, my father and my sister.

641
01:21:18,850 --> 01:21:20,602
You'll get used to it.

642
01:21:23,438 --> 01:21:24,564
I don't want to, sir.

643
01:21:28,902 --> 01:21:30,195
You don't want what?

644
01:21:31,988 --> 01:21:33,490
To get used to this.

645
01:21:38,828 --> 01:21:42,707
How can you not get used to it
when this is now your world?

646
01:21:44,876 --> 01:21:47,170
More so
when you're transferred to Bilibid.

647
01:21:48,213 --> 01:21:49,714
That's a different world altogether.

648
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:02,852
But I'm not guilty, sir.

649
01:22:08,149 --> 01:22:09,943
Who's guilty?

650
01:22:12,070 --> 01:22:13,655
I don't know, sir.

651
01:22:28,962 --> 01:22:34,467
What I meant was,
"Who has sinned?"

652
01:22:36,469 --> 01:22:38,596
What is sin?

653
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:41,766
Why is there sin?

654
01:22:47,772 --> 01:22:49,691
To live is a curse, Joaquin.

655
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,198
Because we don't have a hold
of our lives.

656
01:23:00,285 --> 01:23:01,452
Think about it, man.

657
01:23:02,996 --> 01:23:05,081
Why can't we take hold of our lives?

658
01:23:10,670 --> 01:23:12,922
Especially for us behind bars.

659
01:23:15,341 --> 01:23:17,427
There's no hope.

660
01:23:22,807 --> 01:23:26,102
Those fucking steel bars
you always cling to.

661
01:23:26,227 --> 01:23:28,730
But you can't even begin to grasp
your own life.

662
01:23:32,984 --> 01:23:34,611
They've taken it away from you.

663
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:38,281
It's gone.

664
01:25:13,876 --> 01:25:19,382
<i>I will love and cherish you always</i>

665
01:25:21,843 --> 01:25:28,558
<i>I will cradle you to sleep</i>

666
01:25:29,976 --> 01:25:33,479
<i>In a soft-cloth swing</i>

667
01:25:34,605 --> 01:25:38,985
<i>I will swing you ever so gently</i>

668
01:25:39,110 --> 01:25:43,573
<i>And soon enough you will be asleep</i>

669
01:25:45,366 --> 01:25:51,914
<i>As soon as you have fallen asleep</i>

670
01:25:53,583 --> 01:25:56,419
<i>I will cover your face</i>

671
01:25:56,544 --> 01:25:59,881
<i>With my handkerchief</i>

672
01:26:01,132 --> 01:26:06,971
<i>So no mosquitoes would bite you</i>

673
01:26:07,096 --> 01:26:13,227
<i>And soon you will have a good sleep</i>

674
01:26:15,313 --> 01:26:18,316
<i>Oh, my aching heart</i>

675
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:21,402
<i>It aches, it aches</i>

676
01:26:21,527 --> 01:26:26,866
<i>It hurts badly to the core</i>

677
01:26:28,117 --> 01:26:33,664
<i>So please nurture me</i>

678
01:26:33,790 --> 01:26:40,004
<i>For it is a pity if I would die</i>

679
01:26:41,881 --> 01:26:48,846
<i>As soon as you awaken</i>

680
01:26:50,473 --> 01:26:57,230
<i>I would immediately hold you</i>

681
01:26:59,023 --> 01:27:05,029
<i>And dandle you like an infant</i>

682
01:27:05,154 --> 01:27:10,910
<i>So you could see my sweet smile</i>

683
01:27:13,287 --> 01:27:16,249
<i>Oh, my aching heart</i>

684
01:27:16,374 --> 01:27:19,252
<i>It aches, it aches</i>

685
01:27:19,377 --> 01:27:24,841
<i>It hurts badly to the core</i>

686
01:27:26,092 --> 01:27:31,973
<i>So please nurture me</i>

687
01:27:32,098 --> 01:27:38,020
<i>For it is a pity if I would die</i>

688
01:28:34,410 --> 01:28:39,332
This is what is says in Section 6.

689
01:28:39,457 --> 01:28:41,500
"An appeal must be taken"

690
01:28:41,626 --> 01:28:44,712
"within 15 days
from promulgation of the judgment"

691
01:28:44,837 --> 01:28:48,424
"or from notice
of the final order appealed from."

692
01:28:48,549 --> 01:28:52,553
"This period of perfecting an appeal
shall be suspended"

693
01:28:52,678 --> 01:28:54,680
"from the time a motion
for new trial"

694
01:28:54,805 --> 01:28:57,099
"or reconsideration is filed"

695
01:28:57,224 --> 01:29:00,269
"until notice of the order
overruling the motion"

696
01:29:00,394 --> 01:29:02,980
"has been served upon the accused",
your husband,

697
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:04,982
"or his counsel", that's me,

698
01:29:05,107 --> 01:29:08,444
"at which time the balance
of the period begins to run."

699
01:29:08,569 --> 01:29:10,196
That's it, ma'am.

700
01:29:15,409 --> 01:29:19,080
I didn't understand.
I don't know English.

701
01:29:20,122 --> 01:29:22,375
That's right.

702
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,755
What it means is,

703
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:31,884
"An appeal must be taken
within 15 days."

704
01:29:32,009 --> 01:29:37,974
We're past the appeal.

705
01:29:39,225 --> 01:29:44,105
We had 15 days to appeal.

706
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:50,111
It's been 30 days
since Joaquin's conviction.

707
01:29:51,904 --> 01:29:53,656
We can't file for an appeal anymore.

708
01:29:56,617 --> 01:29:59,078
Why didn't you tell us?

709
01:29:59,203 --> 01:30:03,457
We never discussed filing an appeal.

710
01:30:07,628 --> 01:30:08,671
Right?

711
01:30:25,187 --> 01:30:27,982
I'm ignorant of the law.

712
01:30:28,107 --> 01:30:33,320
But I think you were wrong
to make Joaquin own up to the crime.

713
01:30:37,033 --> 01:30:41,454
You agreed to it.

714
01:30:42,747 --> 01:30:43,789
Am I wrong?

715
01:30:48,377 --> 01:30:50,713
We talked this over and you agreed.

716
01:32:27,977 --> 01:32:30,020
Nose, nose, nose!

717
01:32:30,146 --> 01:32:31,897
Stop!

718
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:37,945
Nose, nose, nose. Teeth!

719
01:32:40,114 --> 01:32:43,242
You're wrong! You're wrong!

720
01:32:43,367 --> 01:32:45,536
Nose, nose, nose.

721
01:32:45,661 --> 01:32:46,704
Tongue!

722
01:32:50,332 --> 01:32:51,876
Nose, nose, nose.

723
01:32:52,001 --> 01:32:53,043
Teeth!

724
01:32:54,128 --> 01:32:55,588
Now I'm the one who's wrong.

725
01:32:55,713 --> 01:32:57,715
Nose, nose, nose. Armpit!

726
01:33:01,218 --> 01:33:06,098
- Need help?
- I got this.

727
01:33:14,190 --> 01:33:16,525
Knee, knee, knee.

728
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:17,693
Mouth.

729
01:33:22,990 --> 01:33:24,283
Greet your mother.

730
01:33:35,085 --> 01:33:36,712
I got you something.

731
01:33:52,478 --> 01:33:54,188
What are you playing?

732
01:33:56,941 --> 01:33:57,983
Here.

733
01:34:26,178 --> 01:34:29,807
- Here, Ate. Come eat with us.
- No thanks..

734
01:34:35,604 --> 01:34:37,690
Eat those.

735
01:34:37,815 --> 01:34:41,694
I'm sleepy. I'll go inside.

736
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:45,030
- Eat some, Ate.
- No, thanks.

737
01:34:45,155 --> 01:34:47,032
Take care of the kids.

738
01:34:48,075 --> 01:34:50,828
- Put them to bed.
- Yes, Ate. I'll take charge.

739
01:36:00,773 --> 01:36:03,650
- Here.
- No, go ahead.

740
01:37:01,917 --> 01:37:05,170
Tomorrow, I'm going to Manila.

741
01:37:06,922 --> 01:37:09,508
- You're going to Manila?
- Yes.

742
01:37:13,929 --> 01:37:15,722
We're going to kill a politician.

743
01:37:21,770 --> 01:37:22,813
Just a job.

744
01:37:34,575 --> 01:37:38,537
In case I don't come back,
take care of yourself.

745
01:37:40,747 --> 01:37:41,999
You're still young.

746
01:37:47,421 --> 01:37:50,632
I can tell you're a good person.

747
01:37:52,468 --> 01:37:54,261
It's tough being good.

748
01:38:06,148 --> 01:38:07,900
I have killed many.

749
01:38:10,903 --> 01:38:12,404
I'm no longer human.

750
01:38:33,634 --> 01:38:35,344
Hold that motherfucker down!

751
01:38:35,469 --> 01:38:39,515
Emong, please no! Emong, no!

752
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:42,726
Emong! No!

753
01:38:42,851 --> 01:38:45,354
Emong! No, Emong!

754
01:43:33,517 --> 01:43:34,643
Good evening, ma'am.

755
01:43:53,745 --> 01:43:57,791
He's good, isn't he?
So talented.

756
01:44:03,797 --> 01:44:06,883
Such a huge mouth.

757
01:44:27,988 --> 01:44:30,699
And he even involved those girls!

758
01:44:33,952 --> 01:44:37,205
- You had to involve them, huh?
- You're showing off!

759
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:38,623
That chick's pretty.

760
01:44:41,001 --> 01:44:43,003
Let's play cards.

761
01:44:43,128 --> 01:44:45,630
- Pao's amazing!
- Thank you.

762
01:44:45,755 --> 01:44:50,176
Good thing Fabian joined us.
See? We're clean.

763
01:44:52,721 --> 01:44:55,223
I thought you were drug addicts.

764
01:44:55,348 --> 01:44:58,643
- We're not that sort.
- That explains why you were aloof.

765
01:44:59,895 --> 01:45:02,856
What are you then?
Born-again Christians?

766
01:45:08,194 --> 01:45:10,322
You're born-again indeed.

767
01:45:10,447 --> 01:45:12,824
Not "born-again."

768
01:45:12,949 --> 01:45:14,868
Fellowship. There's a difference.

769
01:45:17,162 --> 01:45:18,830
Come join us sometime.

770
01:45:18,955 --> 01:45:21,541
No pressure.
It might help, you'll never know.

771
01:45:21,666 --> 01:45:25,045
Do I look like someone
who needs help?

772
01:45:25,170 --> 01:45:28,006
All of us need help. That's all.

773
01:45:32,052 --> 01:45:33,178
All right then.

774
01:45:34,638 --> 01:45:37,182
- When?
- Day after tomorrow.

775
01:45:39,351 --> 01:45:45,190
That day I thought,
is karma getting back at me?

776
01:45:45,315 --> 01:45:52,572
Is this how the Lord gets back at me
for all my sins?

777
01:45:53,698 --> 01:46:00,163
One day, I felt so empty
that I was not quite myself anymore.

778
01:46:00,288 --> 01:46:04,167
I wanted to kill myself.

779
01:46:04,292 --> 01:46:11,341
I thought it was the only way
to erase my problems.

780
01:46:12,717 --> 01:46:15,679
But you know what?

781
01:46:15,804 --> 01:46:19,599
Someone sent me a text message.
It's here in my cell phone.

782
01:46:20,684 --> 01:46:26,231
Before my father died,
he sent me this verse.

783
01:46:26,356 --> 01:46:29,401
John 3:16.

784
01:46:29,526 --> 01:46:34,990
"For God so loved the world
that He gave His only begotten son."

785
01:46:35,115 --> 01:46:39,536
"That whosoever believed in Him
shall not perish."

786
01:46:39,661 --> 01:46:43,540
"But have an everlasting life."

787
01:46:43,665 --> 01:46:48,003
I'm really not used to this.

788
01:46:51,923 --> 01:46:53,508
We're just here.

789
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:59,848
It will come slowly. Just relax.

790
01:46:59,973 --> 01:47:01,558
We've only started.

791
01:47:03,351 --> 01:47:05,395
Just relax.

792
01:47:13,903 --> 01:47:14,946
But it's...

793
01:47:16,740 --> 01:47:18,158
It really used to be...

794
01:47:20,827 --> 01:47:21,953
But then...

795
01:47:27,167 --> 01:47:30,420
After it happened...

796
01:47:32,589 --> 01:47:36,134
I didn't mean to. Really didn't.

797
01:47:36,259 --> 01:47:38,303
But then...

798
01:47:49,564 --> 01:47:53,485
It shouldn't have happened that way.

799
01:47:53,610 --> 01:47:57,405
I meant to do it, but not...

800
01:48:00,450 --> 01:48:01,826
It should have been...

801
01:48:03,995 --> 01:48:05,038
Sorry.

802
01:48:11,377 --> 01:48:12,796
So...

803
01:48:22,806 --> 01:48:24,808
I just needed to go.

804
01:48:24,933 --> 01:48:29,270
I left and now I'm here, and...

805
01:48:31,356 --> 01:48:35,068
I really needed to go, and now...

806
01:48:39,114 --> 01:48:41,157
I'm so far away.

807
01:48:42,867 --> 01:48:45,495
I'm so far away.

808
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:47,914
Sorry.

809
01:48:48,039 --> 01:48:49,874
Let's all pray for our friend here.

810
01:48:49,999 --> 01:48:53,795
Let's all bow our heads
and pray for Fabian.

811
01:48:53,920 --> 01:48:59,384
Lord, take Fabian in your arms,
Lord Jesus.

812
01:48:59,509 --> 01:49:04,889
For his soul
cannot bear the burden of life.

813
01:49:05,014 --> 01:49:10,186
- Please, Lord.
- As heaved upon him, Lord.

814
01:49:10,311 --> 01:49:15,316
We are asking, Lord Jesus,
to help him, Your Father.

815
01:49:15,441 --> 01:49:20,947
As you have helped us, Lord Jesus,
in our own personal ordeals.

816
01:49:23,116 --> 01:49:30,039
Fabian has carried this for so long,
Lord Jesus.

817
01:49:32,041 --> 01:49:37,338
Whatever it is, Father Jesus,
we feel his sorrow.

818
01:49:37,463 --> 01:49:40,717
His silent grief, Lord Jesus.

819
01:49:40,842 --> 01:49:42,135
Lord Jesus.

820
01:49:47,849 --> 01:49:54,189
- I really didn't mean to.
- In Jesus' name.

821
01:49:54,314 --> 01:49:56,524
Calm his spirit.

822
01:49:56,649 --> 01:49:59,944
He really can't do anything, can he?

823
01:50:02,822 --> 01:50:04,824
Do you think I can ever be forgiven?

824
01:50:22,342 --> 01:50:28,598
Whatever it is, Fabian.
He can forgive you.

825
01:50:28,723 --> 01:50:30,850
Have faith, Fabian.

826
01:50:30,975 --> 01:50:32,435
Just have faith.

827
01:50:52,121 --> 01:50:53,164
Fabian.

828
01:52:22,253 --> 01:52:25,548
- It's okay, Fabs.
- Sorry, sorry.

829
01:52:39,479 --> 01:52:42,440
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

830
01:52:43,983 --> 01:52:48,154
- You can't run away from it.
- From where?

831
01:52:49,322 --> 01:52:52,617
You have to face it, whatever it is.

832
01:52:53,701 --> 01:52:57,372
So, the answer's still up to me?

833
01:52:59,332 --> 01:53:00,792
Not the Lord?

834
01:53:00,917 --> 01:53:03,378
Fabian, it's Him. No one else.

835
01:53:03,503 --> 01:53:06,172
You'll have to face it yourself,
but with His help.

836
01:53:11,886 --> 01:53:12,929
We'll see.

837
01:53:23,314 --> 01:53:27,360
Pao, Migs, I'm going.

838
01:53:27,485 --> 01:53:30,947
- It's okay, ma'am.
- I'll go ahead.

839
01:53:31,072 --> 01:53:33,616
Okay, I'll go now. Take care.

840
01:53:39,580 --> 01:53:40,623
Let's go together?

841
01:54:30,756 --> 01:54:32,967
Goodbye.

842
01:54:33,092 --> 01:54:37,180
You don't need
to stay this way forever.

843
01:54:40,099 --> 01:54:41,142
Thanks.

844
01:56:24,245 --> 01:56:26,706
Ading!

845
01:56:26,831 --> 01:56:29,834
Ading! Sarah!

846
01:56:31,669 --> 01:56:33,129
Ading!

847
01:56:34,255 --> 01:56:36,549
Sarah, Junior, come here!

848
01:57:45,076 --> 01:57:49,789
Ate, look here. So may snails!
Looks good, too.

849
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:58,673
Cook them in coconut milk.
Add corchorus and a lot of ginger.

850
01:57:58,798 --> 01:57:59,924
Yes, Ate.

851
01:59:15,249 --> 01:59:19,128
- Will you eat lunch here?
- Yes.

852
01:59:19,253 --> 01:59:20,296
All right.

853
01:59:37,396 --> 01:59:41,984
- Vegetables, sir?
- We still have plenty at home.

854
01:59:42,109 --> 01:59:43,319
Okay then.

855
01:59:44,695 --> 01:59:45,905
Laling!

856
01:59:48,824 --> 01:59:49,950
Laling.

857
01:59:56,040 --> 01:59:59,084
A kilo of pork
has gone up by 15 percent.

858
01:59:59,210 --> 02:00:02,129
So did the price of tuna.
Just add five pesos for it.

859
02:00:08,844 --> 02:00:11,806
Thanks, Eliza.
Do you have alukon?

860
02:00:11,931 --> 02:00:14,767
I don't have any.
I'll bring some tomorrow.

861
02:00:14,892 --> 02:00:17,436
Hey, Eliza, get some rest.

862
02:00:18,771 --> 02:00:21,023
Would you like to join us
in our Christian group?

863
02:00:22,525 --> 02:00:27,404
Another time, maybe.
My family might go hungry.

864
02:00:27,530 --> 02:00:31,200
- Okay.
- Thanks! Veggies!

865
02:00:55,057 --> 02:00:57,309
Wear this one, son. Come.

866
02:01:21,667 --> 02:01:23,878
Ading, double-time.

867
02:02:31,987 --> 02:02:33,030
Let's go.

868
02:02:45,042 --> 02:02:46,085
Let's go!

869
02:03:30,254 --> 02:03:32,381
You can go home now, ma'am.

870
02:05:41,510 --> 02:05:48,308
- Go home, Ading.
- Why, Ate?

871
02:05:48,433 --> 02:05:50,394
Just do it.

872
02:05:50,519 --> 02:05:52,396
Listen.

873
02:05:52,521 --> 02:05:58,402
Underneath the old box,
by its left side, there's money.

874
02:05:59,862 --> 02:06:02,114
Why, Ate?

875
02:06:16,420 --> 02:06:18,172
Go.

876
02:11:08,128 --> 02:11:11,715
Ate, the kids are already asleep.

877
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:15,844
Thank you, Ading.

878
02:11:29,149 --> 02:11:31,318
You know what, Ate?

879
02:11:31,443 --> 02:11:36,406
Sarah and JR were so happy

880
02:11:36,531 --> 02:11:40,452
riding the carousel.

881
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:31,503
Forgive me, Ading.

882
02:12:39,177 --> 02:12:41,555
Why, Ate?

883
02:13:27,392 --> 02:13:33,898
Is Bilibid far from here, Ate?

884
02:13:38,361 --> 02:13:40,780
Very far.

885
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:47,912
How can we visit kuya?

886
02:13:59,257 --> 02:14:01,176
I don't know.

887
02:14:29,162 --> 02:14:34,334
- Ading, go to bed if you're sleepy.
- I'm not, Ate.

888
02:17:44,065 --> 02:17:46,734
That's your second lantern already,
Kuya Joaquin.

889
02:17:47,944 --> 02:17:49,821
I'm just hoping.

890
02:17:49,946 --> 02:17:54,117
Hoping your wife would visit, Kuya?

891
02:17:55,118 --> 02:17:57,579
Me?
I've stopped hoping, Kuya.

892
02:17:57,704 --> 02:18:01,291
Whether someone visits me or not,
I don't really care.

893
02:18:01,416 --> 02:18:04,627
What for?
We're sentenced for life.

894
02:18:04,752 --> 02:18:11,259
Here's where we'd die, Kuya.
Here's where we'd rot.

895
02:18:11,384 --> 02:18:15,179
And that presidential pardon?
It's a lie, Kuya.

896
02:18:15,305 --> 02:18:17,724
It's all politics.

897
02:18:17,849 --> 02:18:21,603
We're the last
among thousands lined up.

898
02:18:21,728 --> 02:18:23,563
Fuck them.

899
02:18:24,814 --> 02:18:27,525
I'm probably not even included.

900
02:18:29,360 --> 02:18:31,571
How about you, Kuya?
Are you in that queue?

901
02:18:38,411 --> 02:18:41,205
Your kids must have grown
by now, Kuya.

902
02:18:43,207 --> 02:18:48,004
Yes, my eldest in now 10.
And my youngest is 8.

903
02:18:48,129 --> 02:18:50,590
Yes, they've grown.

904
02:18:52,967 --> 02:18:55,887
Your wife is fond of lanterns, Kuya?

905
02:18:57,180 --> 02:19:00,725
These small ones are her type.

906
02:19:00,850 --> 02:19:04,479
I'm sure she'd love those, that is,
if she visits you this Christmas.

907
02:19:09,651 --> 02:19:12,362
Don't worry, Kuya.
If your wife visits,

908
02:19:12,487 --> 02:19:14,197
I'll have gifts for your kids.

909
02:19:14,322 --> 02:19:17,742
I earned quite well for these bags.

910
02:19:17,867 --> 02:19:19,786
Thank you, Peryong.

911
02:19:24,374 --> 02:19:31,631
Have your tooth removed.
It's already decaying.

912
02:20:27,729 --> 02:20:29,814
Miki, this will hurt.

913
02:20:29,939 --> 02:20:33,943
We need to clean your wound
so it will heal.

914
02:20:46,956 --> 02:20:48,958
It's suppurating.

915
02:20:50,251 --> 02:20:52,170
Hold on.

916
02:21:06,476 --> 02:21:08,978
You took it for granted.

917
02:21:12,023 --> 02:21:17,820
Sorry, we really have to clean this
or it will get worse.

918
02:21:23,785 --> 02:21:28,915
Avoid sweets.
Avoid fatty food.

919
02:21:31,876 --> 02:21:34,045
Seafoods.

920
02:21:36,798 --> 02:21:44,138
Leon Trinidad, Joselito Pagbidlac,
Eric Topikana, Tepay Bistida,

921
02:21:44,263 --> 02:21:47,892
Clarence Mejomeki,
you have visitors.

922
02:22:00,571 --> 02:22:04,408
Pepito Yustapio, Nardo Tala,

923
02:22:04,534 --> 02:22:09,622
Anton Bacolod, Peryong Villa,
you have visitors.

924
02:22:21,968 --> 02:22:23,803
Peryong, you're mother's here.

925
02:22:23,928 --> 02:22:26,514
Chief, if she gives money,
hand it to me.

926
02:22:26,639 --> 02:22:28,975
If it's food, take it.

927
02:23:01,424 --> 02:23:03,050
Stupid.

928
02:23:07,388 --> 02:23:10,308
Eat.

929
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:18,024
Give them their gifts.

930
02:23:18,149 --> 02:23:21,944
Wakwak is here.
Here are your gifts.

931
02:23:26,032 --> 02:23:30,369
<i>O holy night</i>

932
02:23:30,494 --> 02:23:36,125
<i>The stars are brightly shining</i>

933
02:23:36,250 --> 02:23:43,090
<i>It is the night
of our dear Sa viour's birth</i>

934
02:23:43,216 --> 02:23:47,053
<i>Long lay the world</i>

935
02:23:47,178 --> 02:23:52,183
<i>in sin and error pining</i>

936
02:23:52,308 --> 02:23:59,607
<i>Till He appeared
and the Spirit felt its worth</i>

937
02:23:59,732 --> 02:24:01,734
<i>A thrill...</i>

938
02:24:05,488 --> 02:24:07,240
Hey.

939
02:24:25,174 --> 02:24:29,971
So you think
I didn't see you glance my way?

940
02:24:31,389 --> 02:24:35,059
- I didn't look at you, Sir.
- I saw you.

941
02:24:35,184 --> 02:24:39,146
I see your eyes mocking me.

942
02:24:39,272 --> 02:24:44,402
I saw your mocking eyes!

943
02:24:45,486 --> 02:24:49,073
Your eyes were mocking me.

944
02:24:49,198 --> 02:24:50,283
Fuck you.

945
02:24:50,408 --> 02:24:53,869
- I told you not to look at me.
- I didn't look at you, Sir.

946
02:24:53,995 --> 02:25:00,584
Stand up. Get up, you shit.
You asshole.

947
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:05,506
You are mocking me.

948
02:25:08,426 --> 02:25:10,094
Fuck you.

949
02:25:12,138 --> 02:25:15,057
I didn't look at you, Sir!

950
02:25:15,182 --> 02:25:18,853
You don't look at me that way.

951
02:25:21,355 --> 02:25:23,024
Fuck you.

952
02:25:25,151 --> 02:25:27,820
- Fuck you.
- Kuya Joaquin.

953
02:25:27,945 --> 02:25:32,783
- I wasn't looking at you.
- Mock me again.

954
02:25:34,493 --> 02:25:39,957
Who do you think you're scaring?

955
02:25:43,627 --> 02:25:48,299
Back off, Rotten Tooth.

956
02:25:48,424 --> 02:25:50,301
Back off!

957
02:25:52,678 --> 02:25:55,056
I wasn't looking at you, sir.

958
02:26:00,269 --> 02:26:04,982
You don't look at Wakwak

959
02:26:05,107 --> 02:26:09,737
with mocking eyes!

960
02:26:09,862 --> 02:26:11,864
Fuck you.

961
02:26:33,886 --> 02:26:36,097
I'll be the one to feed you
for a while, all right?

962
02:26:38,933 --> 02:26:40,851
You're such a glutton.

963
02:26:43,646 --> 02:26:46,273
How are you feeling?

964
02:26:46,399 --> 02:26:49,402
Eat first.

965
02:26:53,697 --> 02:26:59,412
Here, Peryong, slowly.

966
02:26:59,537 --> 02:27:05,835
You can do it.

967
02:27:05,960 --> 02:27:08,212
I'll get your food.

968
02:27:13,134 --> 02:27:16,387
Force yourself to it
so you'll recover soon.

969
02:27:28,566 --> 02:27:31,944
You really need to eat.
Peryong.

970
02:27:36,323 --> 02:27:38,784
Salvador, will you lend me a hand?

971
02:27:41,203 --> 02:27:44,748
Pepe? Pepe, please help me
with Peryong, will you?

972
02:27:52,882 --> 02:27:55,384
Hang on, I'll get you water.

973
02:27:58,679 --> 02:28:01,474
Lie down first, lie down.

974
02:28:10,441 --> 02:28:17,031
Guard. Guard.

975
02:28:17,156 --> 02:28:20,117
- Why? What's wrong?
- Peryong has fever.

976
02:28:20,242 --> 02:28:25,164
He hasn't eaten in two days.
Please help him.

977
02:28:28,292 --> 02:28:30,044
Guard.

978
02:28:45,935 --> 02:28:50,022
Rotten Tooth.
Come here.

979
02:28:57,488 --> 02:28:59,532
Sit beside me.

980
02:29:01,283 --> 02:29:02,618
Sit.

981
02:29:09,166 --> 02:29:11,460
You have a lot of fans.

982
02:29:14,213 --> 02:29:18,092
You're here three years
and you're already famous.

983
02:29:19,385 --> 02:29:21,428
They say you're nice.

984
02:29:22,638 --> 02:29:24,431
Helpful.

985
02:29:28,352 --> 02:29:32,773
Nice and helpful, eh?

986
02:29:32,898 --> 02:29:35,192
You're not nice.

987
02:29:35,317 --> 02:29:37,611
You're just pretending
to be helpful.

988
02:29:44,702 --> 02:29:48,914
You know what,
I know that gimmick.

989
02:29:50,708 --> 02:29:52,876
You want the President of the
Republic of the Philippines

990
02:29:53,002 --> 02:29:56,797
to grant you pardon.

991
02:29:58,132 --> 02:30:01,218
I know that strategy so well.

992
02:30:01,343 --> 02:30:06,515
It's been used to death,
Rotten Tooth.

993
02:30:09,560 --> 02:30:11,437
Know what?

994
02:30:13,230 --> 02:30:15,941
If you want to be granted a pardon

995
02:30:16,066 --> 02:30:21,363
by the President of the Republic
of the Philippines...

996
02:30:23,657 --> 02:30:27,453
...be nice to me.

997
02:30:28,746 --> 02:30:32,249
Be helpful to me.

998
02:30:32,374 --> 02:30:36,587
So that the President
of the Republic of the Philippines

999
02:30:36,712 --> 02:30:39,632
will hear that you are a saint.

1000
02:30:55,147 --> 02:31:01,403
I didn't like
what you did the other day.

1001
02:31:01,528 --> 02:31:03,656
Not at all.

1002
02:31:05,991 --> 02:31:08,035
I'm sorry, Sir,
I just took pity on Peryong.

1003
02:31:08,160 --> 02:31:09,995
Pity? Fuck that.

1004
02:31:15,584 --> 02:31:17,628
Rotten Tooth.

1005
02:31:19,838 --> 02:31:25,761
I know what you did.

1006
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:31,725
You killed a mother and her child.

1007
02:31:31,850 --> 02:31:35,104
You massacred a woman
and her teenage daughter.

1008
02:31:35,229 --> 02:31:38,565
A cowardly deed.

1009
02:31:39,692 --> 02:31:42,069
I didn't do it, Sir.

1010
02:31:47,825 --> 02:31:50,452
If you really didn't do it--

1011
02:31:51,829 --> 02:31:54,498
Look at me straight in the eye.

1012
02:32:32,035 --> 02:32:33,704
Try to look at me.

1013
02:32:48,135 --> 02:32:50,053
Fuck.

1014
02:36:22,808 --> 02:36:24,685
- Ading.
- Yes, Ate?

1015
02:36:24,810 --> 02:36:27,145
- Look after the kids.
- Yes, Ate.

1016
02:36:27,270 --> 02:36:30,983
Make them fried bananas for school.

1017
02:36:31,108 --> 02:36:37,155
Easy on the sugar,
JR might get a toothache.

1018
02:36:39,032 --> 02:36:43,120
- Take care, Ate.
- You, too.

1019
02:37:06,685 --> 02:37:12,024
- How much is this?
- This one's 30. That's 20.

1020
02:37:12,149 --> 02:37:16,737
Tomatoes?
Fifteen.

1021
02:37:36,173 --> 02:37:40,594
- This, Ading?
- This is 10.

1022
02:37:40,719 --> 02:37:44,514
This, 5 each so it's also 10.

1023
02:37:46,892 --> 02:37:49,186
All of it was 20.

1024
02:37:52,147 --> 02:37:54,316
And tomatoes.

1025
02:38:09,498 --> 02:38:12,834
You found snails already, Sarah?

1026
02:38:54,918 --> 02:38:58,130
- Hey, stop that now.
- Just a little while, Auntie.

1027
02:38:58,255 --> 02:39:01,091
You still have classes.

1028
02:39:02,342 --> 02:39:08,056
Come over here, JR.

1029
02:39:20,443 --> 02:39:22,362
Scrub it.

1030
02:43:56,970 --> 02:44:00,390
Ate? Ate?

1031
02:44:49,022 --> 02:44:50,648
Thanks, Kuya.

1032
02:45:16,966 --> 02:45:20,720
- Sarah. Why are you awake?
- I can't sleep anymore.

1033
02:45:21,679 --> 02:45:24,224
Ate.

1034
02:45:24,349 --> 02:45:28,645
Mrs Trinidad came

1035
02:45:28,770 --> 02:45:35,568
and asked if we still want
to do their laundry.

1036
02:45:35,693 --> 02:45:37,779
Yes, tell her, yes.

1037
02:45:37,904 --> 02:45:41,366
Saturdays and Sundays.

1038
02:45:41,491 --> 02:45:43,910
I will, Ate.

1039
02:45:46,955 --> 02:45:51,709
- Careful with the vegetables.
- Yes, Mama.

1040
02:50:18,768 --> 02:50:20,686
Sarah?

1041
02:50:23,272 --> 02:50:27,109
What's wrong?

1042
02:50:30,780 --> 02:50:32,865
What's wrong, my child?

1043
02:50:37,662 --> 02:50:40,540
Why won't you speak?
What happened?

1044
02:50:40,665 --> 02:50:45,628
My classmates said
Father is a criminal.

1045
02:51:05,147 --> 02:51:09,944
I knew this would happen, Sarah.

1046
02:51:11,404 --> 02:51:14,740
It will happen over and over.

1047
02:51:14,866 --> 02:51:17,869
What happened to your father
will be brought up.

1048
02:51:19,245 --> 02:51:21,664
We cannot avoid it.

1049
02:51:23,791 --> 02:51:27,086
You have to accept the truth.

1050
02:51:30,715 --> 02:51:33,926
It's true
that your father is in prison.

1051
02:51:34,969 --> 02:51:38,264
He's in the National Penitentiary.

1052
02:51:39,557 --> 02:51:42,393
That's where they put criminals.

1053
02:51:43,728 --> 02:51:46,856
But always remember this.

1054
02:51:48,065 --> 02:51:50,860
Your father is not a criminal.

1055
02:51:53,738 --> 02:51:56,616
Your father is a good man.

1056
02:51:57,992 --> 02:52:00,578
He's a good human being.

1057
02:52:02,580 --> 02:52:05,458
He loves you so much.

1058
02:52:05,583 --> 02:52:09,629
He took good care of you
when you were little.

1059
02:52:11,923 --> 02:52:14,550
Don't be ashamed of him.

1060
02:52:18,179 --> 02:52:23,351
When people tease you
that your father is in prison,

1061
02:52:23,476 --> 02:52:28,105
don't get mad.
Don't get hurt.

1062
02:52:29,273 --> 02:52:31,275
Because it is the truth.

1063
02:52:32,944 --> 02:52:39,825
But it is not true
that he is a criminal.

1064
02:52:39,951 --> 02:52:42,787
He was falsely accused.

1065
02:52:44,914 --> 02:52:50,670
Your father is a good man.

1066
02:52:51,796 --> 02:52:57,134
Always remember that.

1067
02:52:57,259 --> 02:52:59,720
Yes, Mother.

1068
02:53:02,515 --> 02:53:04,600
Go to sleep now.

1069
02:53:07,770 --> 02:53:11,148
Sarah, please?
Keep that in mind.

1070
02:53:11,273 --> 02:53:13,693
Yes, Mama.

1071
02:53:18,322 --> 02:53:20,783
Maybe we were wrong.

1072
02:53:20,908 --> 02:53:25,830
Joaquin and I decided that,
no matter what...

1073
02:53:25,955 --> 02:53:31,460
...neither of us
would live the country.

1074
02:53:34,547 --> 02:53:38,843
There were many chances to leave.

1075
02:53:38,968 --> 02:53:41,262
We didn't take them.

1076
02:53:43,681 --> 02:53:48,811
We didn't want to end up
like many of the people here.

1077
02:53:52,565 --> 02:53:55,276
They have lots of money,

1078
02:53:55,401 --> 02:54:01,365
big houses, nice cars...

1079
02:54:04,201 --> 02:54:08,164
...but their children grow up
without a mother or a father.

1080
02:54:15,129 --> 02:54:18,007
Not to judge them.

1081
02:54:18,132 --> 02:54:21,135
We just have a different outlook.

1082
02:54:24,972 --> 02:54:27,933
I often wonder.

1083
02:54:28,059 --> 02:54:30,269
Maybe, just maybe,

1084
02:54:30,394 --> 02:54:35,441
if I let Joaquin work abroad...

1085
02:54:40,446 --> 02:54:43,115
...maybe none of this
would have happened.

1086
02:55:23,114 --> 02:55:24,573
Peryong!

1087
02:55:29,286 --> 02:55:30,955
Peryong!

1088
02:55:40,589 --> 02:55:42,508
Come here. Help me.

1089
02:56:01,694 --> 02:56:03,779
Take it easy, Sir.

1090
02:57:13,390 --> 02:57:16,185
Here, Sir. Easy.

1091
02:58:03,357 --> 02:58:06,151
This is to freshen you up, Sir.

1092
02:59:07,588 --> 02:59:10,841
This reminds me of my wife.

1093
02:59:10,966 --> 02:59:13,135
I give her a massage,

1094
02:59:13,260 --> 02:59:19,767
whenever she doesn't feel well.

1095
02:59:19,892 --> 02:59:22,728
I always think of her.

1096
02:59:22,853 --> 02:59:27,900
It's been four years
since I last saw her.

1097
02:59:28,025 --> 02:59:31,862
But it's okay.

1098
02:59:33,489 --> 02:59:36,700
I'm coping.

1099
02:59:36,825 --> 02:59:42,664
I also know my family's doing well.

1100
02:59:49,254 --> 02:59:52,132
How many kids do you have, Sir?

1101
02:59:54,343 --> 02:59:56,553
I have two.

1102
02:59:56,678 --> 03:00:00,307
One is 12 years old.

1103
03:00:00,432 --> 03:00:04,144
My youngest is 10.

1104
03:00:04,269 --> 03:00:06,480
This might hurt, Sir.

1105
03:00:11,527 --> 03:00:16,281
I bet my youngest is naughty.
10 years old.

1106
03:00:16,407 --> 03:00:18,742
When I was his age,

1107
03:00:18,867 --> 03:00:24,039
my mother used to chase after me
all the time.

1108
03:00:24,164 --> 03:00:28,168
I slip to any corner.
Sometimes, I was at my neighbours'.

1109
03:00:28,293 --> 03:00:31,255
Where they couldn't see me.

1110
03:00:35,092 --> 03:00:37,553
I wonder what they're doing
right now.

1111
03:00:52,568 --> 03:00:56,989
This is my wife's favourite spot,
the feet.

1112
03:00:57,114 --> 03:01:01,118
She falls asleep
when I massage her feet.

1113
03:01:04,663 --> 03:01:06,915
Relaxing, isn't it?

1114
03:01:15,382 --> 03:01:19,678
There must be lots of decorations
in our town by now.

1115
03:01:19,803 --> 03:01:23,223
Christmas is so alive there.

1116
03:01:23,348 --> 03:01:28,812
Lanterns, lights, the people.

1117
03:01:34,943 --> 03:01:37,654
I miss them.

1118
03:01:37,779 --> 03:01:40,365
Can't do anything about it, can we?

1119
03:01:41,825 --> 03:01:43,911
We just have to bear with it.

1120
03:01:49,541 --> 03:01:54,713
- Joaquin?
- Yes, Sir?

1121
03:02:06,808 --> 03:02:13,565
Forgive me.

1122
03:02:25,661 --> 03:02:28,330
Forgive me.

1123
03:02:41,802 --> 03:02:48,475
Forgive me.

1124
03:02:57,192 --> 03:03:03,240
It's nothing, Sir.
Merry Christmas, Sir Wakwak.

1125
03:03:23,885 --> 03:03:26,680
Is that true, Kuya?

1126
03:03:26,805 --> 03:03:30,601
You can travel and see your family?

1127
03:03:30,726 --> 03:03:33,020
Yes, but I can't go near them.

1128
03:03:33,145 --> 03:03:37,733
You're like an angel then.

1129
03:03:37,858 --> 03:03:40,902
Anyway, you really are an angel.

1130
03:03:41,028 --> 03:03:44,865
If it weren't for you,
I'd have killed Wakwak.

1131
03:03:44,990 --> 03:03:49,745
Or I would have been killed by now.

1132
03:03:52,956 --> 03:03:57,794
Kuya, thanks.

1133
03:03:57,919 --> 03:04:01,048
It's nothing.
Go on, keep watering the plants.

1134
03:09:38,885 --> 03:09:40,512
Thanks.

1135
03:10:35,775 --> 03:10:37,777
Veggies, Sir?

1136
03:10:57,714 --> 03:11:02,343
- What's this, Sir?
- I just want to help.

1137
03:11:32,207 --> 03:11:34,000
Sir?

1138
03:12:03,113 --> 03:12:08,201
Sir, wait up.

1139
03:12:08,326 --> 03:12:12,956
- What's this money for?
- A little help.

1140
03:12:14,499 --> 03:12:16,167
Why, Sir?

1141
03:12:19,546 --> 03:12:22,382
Nothing.
I see how hard you work.

1142
03:12:24,968 --> 03:12:27,971
Sir, I can't take this.
It's too much.

1143
03:12:28,096 --> 03:12:30,932
It's just a little help.

1144
03:12:31,057 --> 03:12:35,395
Keep it.
You need that, right?

1145
03:12:35,520 --> 03:12:39,315
It's yours.
No need to worry.

1146
03:12:41,109 --> 03:12:43,069
No, really.

1147
03:13:33,494 --> 03:13:37,540
Friends, Romans, Countrymen,
lend me your ears.

1148
03:13:37,665 --> 03:13:41,502
I come to burry Caesar,
not to praise him.

1149
03:13:41,628 --> 03:13:48,092
- How are you?
- Man. How about you? You're back.

1150
03:13:48,218 --> 03:13:49,636
Congrats.

1151
03:13:49,761 --> 03:13:52,347
I heard you were one
of the topnotchers in the bar.

1152
03:13:52,472 --> 03:13:53,890
That was three years ago, right?

1153
03:13:54,015 --> 03:13:56,809
Pure luck, man.
You weren't there.

1154
03:13:56,935 --> 03:13:59,520
You're being humble, man.

1155
03:13:59,646 --> 03:14:02,148
But, man, what about you?

1156
03:14:02,273 --> 03:14:05,401
You could have been
the school's bet,

1157
03:14:05,526 --> 03:14:08,154
had you finished Law.

1158
03:14:08,279 --> 03:14:11,741
We were sure
you'd be number one at the bar.

1159
03:14:11,866 --> 03:14:14,452
And finally there'd be
a number one from our school.

1160
03:14:14,577 --> 03:14:17,538
It's an illusion.

1161
03:14:17,664 --> 03:14:19,999
Man, it's the truth.

1162
03:14:23,544 --> 03:14:28,299
What's the problem, idol?
Coconut?

1163
03:14:29,884 --> 03:14:32,262
Sorry. Sorry.

1164
03:14:32,387 --> 03:14:35,640
Fabian, where are the papers?

1165
03:14:40,520 --> 03:14:42,146
Here.

1166
03:14:42,272 --> 03:14:46,067
<i>People of the Philippines
v Joaquin Atilano.</i>

1167
03:14:46,192 --> 03:14:48,069
Reclusion Perpetua.

1168
03:14:48,194 --> 03:14:52,657
We know this case.
Horrifying.

1169
03:14:52,782 --> 03:14:55,243
Worst crime in La Paz.

1170
03:14:57,245 --> 03:14:59,872
This was the sensational news then.

1171
03:14:59,998 --> 03:15:02,500
And it even made it
to the national news.

1172
03:15:02,625 --> 03:15:06,170
You used to live there, right?
Fabian Viduya, The Great?

1173
03:15:08,631 --> 03:15:12,552
My God, you look so menacing
with that beard.

1174
03:15:14,220 --> 03:15:16,389
You look like a hoodlum.

1175
03:15:16,514 --> 03:15:22,061
But anyway, my boy,
welcome home, my prodigal son.

1176
03:15:22,186 --> 03:15:28,443
And look, Fabian's belly grew.
That's progress.

1177
03:15:33,656 --> 03:15:37,618
Joaquin Atilano.
Not guilty.

1178
03:15:39,579 --> 03:15:44,042
Open the case once more.
Analyze it.

1179
03:15:45,460 --> 03:15:49,964
Maybe you can help the family
by doing something to free him.

1180
03:15:51,049 --> 03:15:56,095
Use your genius minds
in Criminal Law.

1181
03:15:59,766 --> 03:16:03,561
Wait. The judgment has long
been final and executory.

1182
03:16:03,686 --> 03:16:05,855
And he pleaded guilty.

1183
03:16:05,980 --> 03:16:09,108
Believe me, the man is innocent.

1184
03:16:15,990 --> 03:16:18,117
Poor family.

1185
03:16:19,243 --> 03:16:22,372
His wife is peddling vegetables.

1186
03:16:22,497 --> 03:16:25,375
Feeds three.

1187
03:16:25,500 --> 03:16:27,585
Aggravating factors?

1188
03:16:29,170 --> 03:16:30,922
Three witnesses.

1189
03:16:31,047 --> 03:16:33,257
Thirty hours before the crime,

1190
03:16:33,383 --> 03:16:39,972
Magda's maid saw Joaquin slap
and strangle her.

1191
03:16:40,098 --> 03:16:42,558
There are even two witnesses

1192
03:16:42,683 --> 03:16:48,523
who saw Joaquin quickly
come out of the house after that.

1193
03:16:48,648 --> 03:16:53,403
Joaquin's family owes Magda
a lot of money.

1194
03:16:53,528 --> 03:16:57,115
Any mitigating circumstances?

1195
03:16:57,240 --> 03:16:59,450
According to the accused,
he was in Batac.

1196
03:16:59,575 --> 03:17:01,244
At a construction site.

1197
03:17:01,369 --> 03:17:05,957
And his co-workers attested to it.

1198
03:17:06,082 --> 03:17:08,126
Joaquin has no criminal record.

1199
03:17:08,251 --> 03:17:11,546
He's a good man,
according to the people of La Paz.

1200
03:17:13,423 --> 03:17:17,051
Wait. Fabian.

1201
03:17:18,344 --> 03:17:21,055
- What got you into this case?
- I agree.

1202
03:17:21,180 --> 03:17:23,724
Why are you interested in this case?

1203
03:17:25,518 --> 03:17:29,355
Interest?
We should all care.

1204
03:17:30,982 --> 03:17:34,777
A man is in jail.
But he's innocent.

1205
03:17:36,529 --> 03:17:39,282
You're one of a kind, Fabian.

1206
03:17:39,407 --> 03:17:43,828
That's why I'm aching
to see you finish Law.

1207
03:17:45,913 --> 03:17:48,166
This country needs you.

1208
03:17:50,668 --> 03:17:52,795
Nation is a myth.

1209
03:17:54,797 --> 03:17:56,591
It's a horrible concept.

1210
03:17:56,716 --> 03:17:58,676
Here we go again.

1211
03:17:58,801 --> 03:18:03,055
- It's a failure.
- Wait.

1212
03:18:03,181 --> 03:18:05,850
Listen.

1213
03:18:05,975 --> 03:18:10,354
Enough of that

1214
03:18:10,480 --> 03:18:14,859
- 21st century vision of yours...?
- Of Zero society.

1215
03:18:14,984 --> 03:18:17,695
Let me enjoy my coffee, man.

1216
03:18:19,238 --> 03:18:23,826
Caesar.
Brutus' best friend.

1217
03:18:23,951 --> 03:18:26,412
What's your take on the case?

1218
03:18:28,873 --> 03:18:31,167
Yes, you.

1219
03:18:32,668 --> 03:18:38,549
Yes. I'll take the case.

1220
03:18:38,674 --> 03:18:43,513
I saw the records, talked to the
lawyer who handled the case.

1221
03:18:44,764 --> 03:18:50,603
There's a chance, yes.
It'll be hard but I'll do my best.

1222
03:18:50,728 --> 03:18:56,192
I will be needing your help, people.

1223
03:18:59,320 --> 03:19:03,824
Go. There you go.

1224
03:19:03,950 --> 03:19:07,036
Okay, son.
You got your wish.

1225
03:19:07,161 --> 03:19:11,290
- So, is this a commitment now?
- By deed.

1226
03:19:12,667 --> 03:19:15,378
- With faithfulness.
- Free of charge?

1227
03:19:15,503 --> 03:19:19,882
Hey, Moira.
I can't give my services for free.

1228
03:19:20,007 --> 03:19:22,552
She's rich.

1229
03:19:22,677 --> 03:19:27,682
She can take all her cases for free,
no problem.

1230
03:19:29,433 --> 03:19:30,935
Thanks.

1231
03:19:36,315 --> 03:19:37,858
Fight.

1232
03:19:39,986 --> 03:19:42,363
Fabian.

1233
03:21:01,442 --> 03:21:05,946
<i>And I saw them by the field</i>

1234
03:21:07,323 --> 03:21:12,244
<i>In a land that was almost burning</i>

1235
03:21:12,370 --> 03:21:15,539
<i>With the sins of mankind</i>

1236
03:21:18,918 --> 03:21:21,921
<i>With the sins of the world</i>

1237
03:21:54,995 --> 03:22:00,543
Why did you do this...

1238
03:22:07,883 --> 03:22:12,054
Lord, I thank you for this new day.

1239
03:22:12,179 --> 03:22:17,727
I awoke with peace of mind

1240
03:22:17,852 --> 03:22:21,021
and joy in my heart.

1241
03:22:21,147 --> 03:22:24,608
Lord, I know
that you'll watch over me today.

1242
03:22:24,734 --> 03:22:27,445
You are always beside me.

1243
03:22:27,570 --> 03:22:29,447
Don't forsake me.

1244
03:22:29,572 --> 03:22:35,911
Continue to bear
with my weaknesses.

1245
03:22:39,165 --> 03:22:45,546
Give me strength
and clarity of purpose.

1246
03:22:46,630 --> 03:22:50,926
Don't abandon me,
don't tire of me.

1247
03:22:51,051 --> 03:22:56,390
You are my strength, my eyes,
my...

1248
03:23:10,446 --> 03:23:12,615
Ading.

1249
03:23:57,034 --> 03:23:59,703
We haven't seen each other
in a while.

1250
03:23:59,829 --> 03:24:02,832
Four years to be exact.

1251
03:24:02,957 --> 03:24:05,751
You don't keep in touch.

1252
03:24:06,919 --> 03:24:09,922
Where have you been,
what have you been up to?

1253
03:24:14,468 --> 03:24:21,433
You have a year to go
and you're at the top of your class.

1254
03:24:21,559 --> 03:24:24,478
Don't you want
to finish your course?

1255
03:24:28,315 --> 03:24:30,484
It's such a waste, isn't it?

1256
03:24:30,609 --> 03:24:34,738
If it's about money,
let me take care of it.

1257
03:24:34,864 --> 03:24:37,449
My farm's stable now.

1258
03:24:37,575 --> 03:24:41,662
Pick any Law school,
I'll pay for it.

1259
03:24:41,787 --> 03:24:43,956
Just graduate.

1260
03:25:12,026 --> 03:25:13,819
Where's Yumi?

1261
03:25:15,321 --> 03:25:16,780
She's at the old house.

1262
03:25:16,906 --> 03:25:19,617
I can't be bothered.
Don't like dogs.

1263
03:25:20,784 --> 03:25:24,204
Granda puts up with it.

1264
03:25:24,330 --> 03:25:26,040
You're his favourite after all.

1265
03:25:26,165 --> 03:25:28,334
You should see him.

1266
03:25:28,459 --> 03:25:31,837
It's been a long time
since I last visited.

1267
03:25:35,341 --> 03:25:37,718
Lucky old man.

1268
03:25:38,928 --> 03:25:41,013
I pay for everything.

1269
03:25:41,138 --> 03:25:44,850
His food, his house help,
Yumi's food.

1270
03:26:05,204 --> 03:26:07,748
You missed the food here,
didn't you?

1271
03:26:14,588 --> 03:26:16,840
Oh, Ading.

1272
03:26:17,925 --> 03:26:19,718
I'll get some sleep.

1273
03:26:21,053 --> 03:26:23,430
Won't you get indigestion?

1274
03:26:43,409 --> 03:26:45,452
Want me to wake you?

1275
03:26:50,416 --> 03:26:53,836
How can we plant these
when the soil can't be dug up?

1276
03:26:53,961 --> 03:26:57,172
Look at this, the soil is so dry.

1277
03:26:58,799 --> 03:27:01,301
Do we even have a harvest
in this area?

1278
03:27:01,427 --> 03:27:05,389
You know it's not going to rain
anytime soon yet.

1279
03:27:06,724 --> 03:27:11,353
What shall we do now?

1280
03:27:11,478 --> 03:27:15,274
Don't be scared of me.
I just needed someone to talk to me.

1281
03:27:15,399 --> 03:27:17,443
Help me.

1282
03:27:17,568 --> 03:27:21,113
We don't harvest, we don't earn.

1283
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:27,995
- Can we plant these now?
- Yes, Ma'am.

1284
03:27:28,120 --> 03:27:30,122
Even though the soil is dry?

1285
03:27:30,247 --> 03:27:33,625
We'll set-up a water system here,
Ma'am.

1286
03:27:33,751 --> 03:27:36,420
Where do we get one?

1287
03:28:10,412 --> 03:28:14,917
Fabian.
Ading.

1288
03:28:16,001 --> 03:28:18,087
Where are you going?

1289
03:28:36,855 --> 03:28:41,068
Know what?
Nothing beats farming.

1290
03:28:43,237 --> 03:28:46,740
This is mine, all ten hectares.

1291
03:28:46,865 --> 03:28:51,411
We plant corn and tobacco.

1292
03:28:51,537 --> 03:28:54,540
And if there's a demand, sorghum.

1293
03:28:54,665 --> 03:28:58,168
But you know what our top crop is?

1294
03:28:58,293 --> 03:29:00,170
Tobacco.

1295
03:29:03,006 --> 03:29:08,387
Which explains what you see,
a field overrun with tobacco.

1296
03:29:08,512 --> 03:29:11,807
Remember the property next to ours?

1297
03:29:11,932 --> 03:29:16,353
- The one owned by the Rachos?
- Yes.

1298
03:29:16,478 --> 03:29:19,898
That's seven hectares.
I bought it.

1299
03:29:20,023 --> 03:29:26,071
They went bankrupt after
Mrs Racho committed suicide.

1300
03:29:26,196 --> 03:29:31,326
There I plant rice and watermelon.

1301
03:29:31,451 --> 03:29:35,914
And in the hilly part,
papaya and dragonfruit.

1302
03:29:37,291 --> 03:29:43,505
Don't leave.

1303
03:29:44,798 --> 03:29:48,385
Life is good here.

1304
03:29:48,510 --> 03:29:50,929
Badoc is rich.

1305
03:29:52,306 --> 03:29:54,224
Come stay here with me.

1306
03:29:59,605 --> 03:30:01,940
I have a headache.

1307
03:30:45,734 --> 03:30:47,653
Ading.

1308
03:30:50,239 --> 03:30:52,282
Ading.

1309
03:30:53,784 --> 03:30:56,078
Oh, Fabian.

1310
03:31:03,001 --> 03:31:05,254
Fabian?

1311
03:31:05,379 --> 03:31:08,131
I've been looking for you.
Dinner's ready.

1312
03:31:08,257 --> 03:31:11,510
- Later.
- Let's eat.

1313
03:31:19,434 --> 03:31:22,062
What now, Ading?
You staying?

1314
03:31:22,187 --> 03:31:23,647
Take up farming.

1315
03:31:23,772 --> 03:31:28,485
You can live here
or at the old house.

1316
03:31:28,610 --> 03:31:30,445
I'll take care of the capital.

1317
03:31:30,570 --> 03:31:35,909
You just need to develop the land.
I'll help.

1318
03:31:38,745 --> 03:31:44,084
- I'll think about it.
- While you're at it, finish Law.

1319
03:31:44,209 --> 03:31:48,171
Just a year left.

1320
03:31:48,297 --> 03:31:50,465
You keep repeating yourself.

1321
03:31:52,467 --> 03:31:57,389
I'll keep saying it.
I'm the only family you've got.

1322
03:31:57,514 --> 03:32:01,560
- We're not a family.
- What did you say?

1323
03:32:01,685 --> 03:32:03,729
We're no family.

1324
03:32:03,854 --> 03:32:06,440
I don't believe in family anymore.

1325
03:32:06,565 --> 03:32:11,528
What are you saying?
We're brother and sister.

1326
03:32:11,653 --> 03:32:13,280
It's like this.

1327
03:32:14,448 --> 03:32:18,744
Ate Hoda. Mos. Hoda Viduya, listen.

1328
03:32:18,869 --> 03:32:21,455
I'm done with this family.

1329
03:32:29,421 --> 03:32:31,548
Let's say something is...

1330
03:32:34,009 --> 03:32:37,429
Let's say something
is dysfunctional.

1331
03:32:37,554 --> 03:32:40,515
Put an end to it.
Simple.

1332
03:32:43,685 --> 03:32:46,438
Our family is long cursed.

1333
03:32:46,563 --> 03:32:51,276
Thanks to the failures
of our so-called parents.

1334
03:32:51,401 --> 03:32:53,695
Where the hell are they?

1335
03:32:53,820 --> 03:32:56,948
When we were growing up,
where were they?

1336
03:32:57,074 --> 03:32:58,700
Not here.

1337
03:32:59,910 --> 03:33:02,079
One was in America,
the other one in Europe.

1338
03:33:02,204 --> 03:33:03,705
It was just you and me.

1339
03:33:03,830 --> 03:33:07,292
The maids raised us.

1340
03:33:07,417 --> 03:33:14,466
Right? Big sister Hoda, right?
Am I right? Mos. Hoda Viduya?

1341
03:33:17,010 --> 03:33:18,553
This family ceased
to exist a long time ago.

1342
03:33:18,678 --> 03:33:21,765
The Viduya family
is one rotten institution!

1343
03:33:21,890 --> 03:33:26,395
Rotten to the core!
It's finished!

1344
03:33:29,439 --> 03:33:31,191
Look at you.

1345
03:33:33,151 --> 03:33:36,530
No man can stand you.
Crazy bitch.

1346
03:33:38,490 --> 03:33:41,910
You're the rotten one!
Asshole!

1347
03:33:42,035 --> 03:33:45,038
Sorry, Lord.
Sorry, I've sinned.

1348
03:33:45,163 --> 03:33:48,708
I asked you to watch over me.
Why did you forsake me?

1349
03:33:48,834 --> 03:33:51,128
Don't leave me.

1350
03:33:51,253 --> 03:33:54,256
Sorry, Lord. Sorry.

1351
03:33:56,758 --> 03:34:01,221
Fabian? Ading?

1352
03:34:01,346 --> 03:34:03,723
Let's have dinner.

1353
03:34:11,606 --> 03:34:14,526
Ading?

1354
03:34:14,651 --> 03:34:17,654
Dinner is ready.

1355
03:35:14,294 --> 03:35:18,715
Why are you sleeping here?

1356
03:35:22,594 --> 03:35:26,973
I don't want to sleep inside.

1357
03:35:34,523 --> 03:35:36,858
What's the drama about this time?

1358
03:35:40,904 --> 03:35:46,368
I'm able to think here.
No drama.

1359
03:35:46,493 --> 03:35:49,246
If that's the case, go inside.

1360
03:35:50,372 --> 03:35:52,958
How can you sleep here?

1361
03:35:54,167 --> 03:35:56,378
How can you sleep in that house?

1362
03:36:00,257 --> 03:36:04,469
- Come inside, okay?
- I'm fine.

1363
03:36:04,594 --> 03:36:08,765
Don't make me your problem.
I'll be gone in a few days.

1364
03:36:08,890 --> 03:36:12,227
I do not consider you a problem.

1365
03:36:14,813 --> 03:36:17,607
In fact, I'm asking you to stay.

1366
03:36:18,692 --> 03:36:22,279
Please. Go inside.

1367
03:38:38,039 --> 03:38:42,377
Ading. Ading.

1368
03:38:56,141 --> 03:38:58,768
I'm your sister, Ading.

1369
03:39:07,527 --> 03:39:09,612
Enough.

1370
03:39:23,877 --> 03:39:26,671
Ading, stop it!

1371
03:41:09,607 --> 03:41:11,109
Yumi.

1372
03:41:14,404 --> 03:41:16,030
Yumi.

1373
03:41:21,244 --> 03:41:23,037
Yumi.

1374
03:41:31,296 --> 03:41:32,922
Yumi.

1375
03:41:36,175 --> 03:41:40,013
Yumi. Yumi, Yumi, come here.
Yumi.

1376
03:53:43,694 --> 03:53:45,321
Forgive me.

1377
03:53:49,867 --> 03:53:55,414
Forgive me for the four years...

1378
03:53:55,539 --> 03:53:59,418
...I did not come to visit you.

1379
03:54:17,561 --> 03:54:21,023
Junior is looking
more and more like you.

1380
03:54:23,275 --> 03:54:25,944
He really is.

1381
03:54:26,070 --> 03:54:29,448
Sarah will be in fifth grade
next school year.

1382
03:54:29,573 --> 03:54:31,992
She's growing up so fast.

1383
03:54:34,078 --> 03:54:35,954
I know.

1384
03:54:45,172 --> 03:54:47,591
Please, tell the kids...

1385
03:54:48,842 --> 03:54:51,428
...I love them so much.

1386
03:54:54,181 --> 03:54:57,059
I am always with them.

1387
03:54:58,394 --> 03:55:00,771
I am always with you.

1388
04:00:16,211 --> 04:00:18,922
- How much?
- For what?

1389
04:00:19,047 --> 04:00:21,008
A boat ride.

1390
04:00:21,133 --> 04:00:25,137
The boats are for fishing.
We don't ferry passengers.
