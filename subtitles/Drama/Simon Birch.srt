                    [ Rebecca ] 
                    hi, Simon ! 

385
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,374
                I have something
                for you.        

386
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:32,477
    - You made that for me ?    
    - I did indeed,             
      my little doll.           

387
00:27:32,545 --> 00:27:36,615
I think it's gonna              
be getting cool pretty soon     
and you need to have...         

388
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:41,119
            A beautiful sweater 
            just for you.       

389
00:27:41,186 --> 00:27:44,589
        Hopefully, a good fit.  

390
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:46,591
                So, let's see ? 

391
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,462
            Oops !  [ chuckles ]
            oh, my goodness.    

392
00:27:50,529 --> 00:27:52,497
                        Well,   

393
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:56,501
                What a very long
                piece of yarn.  

394
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:59,837
        He looks like           
        a hobo.                 
It's perfect.                   

395
00:27:59,905 --> 00:28:01,906
Just like you.                  

396
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:07,412
                Come on.        

397
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,415
    [ Reverend ]                
    as it is he whose           
    transgression is forgiven...

398
00:28:10,483 --> 00:28:12,450
        Whose sin is covered.   

399
00:28:12,518 --> 00:28:15,453
        I said I will confess   
        my transgressions       
        unto the Lord...        

400
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:19,824
        And thou forgave us     
        the inequity of my sin. 

401
00:28:19,892 --> 00:28:22,661
    - The word of the Lord.     
    - [ all ]  thanks be to God.

402
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:25,830
            I'd like to take    
            a few minutes       
            to discuss some...  

403
00:28:25,898 --> 00:28:28,132
    Of the upcoming activities  
    on the church calendar.     

404
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,736
Here we go.                     

405
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:35,473
        What's wrong, Simon ?   
Who knows what God thinks       
about current events ?          

406
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:40,244
        - Does someone have     
          a question ?          
        - Uh, no, sir.          

407
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:43,080
        Uh, your honor, no.     

408
00:28:43,148 --> 00:28:46,618
        Father, thank you.      
        No, sir.                

409
00:28:46,686 --> 00:28:50,188
        It's always nice        
        to see new faces        
        in the congregation.    

410
00:28:50,255 --> 00:28:52,557
            Uh, I'd like        
            to invite them...   

411
00:28:52,625 --> 00:28:55,327
To join my wife and children    
and, uh, myself...              

412
00:28:55,394 --> 00:28:57,696
For coffee and donuts           
downstairs after the service.   

413
00:28:57,763 --> 00:29:02,967
- What does coffee and donuts   
  have to do with God ?         
- Simon, you better be quiet.   

414
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:06,087
    Simon, is there something   
    you'd like to share         
    with the rest of us ?       

415
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:13,545
I said, "what does coffee       
and donuts have to do           
with God ?"                     

416
00:29:13,612 --> 00:29:19,351
They're merely refreshments     
so people can socialize and, uh,
discuss the upcoming activities.

417
00:29:19,418 --> 00:29:22,420
Whoever said that church needs  
a continental breakfast ?       

418
00:29:22,488 --> 00:29:25,890
- <i>Simon !</i>                       
<i>- I doubt that God is interested</i>
<i>  in our church activities.</i>     

419
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:29,427
- Simon !                       
- If God has made the church    
  bake sale our priority,       

420
00:29:29,495 --> 00:29:32,346
Then I'd say we're all          
in a lot of trouble.            

421
00:29:32,414 --> 00:29:35,099
        Simon, that is enough !

        To go to Sunday school.

00:29:45,678 --> 00:29:48,012
    [ seething ]

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,215
                [ Ms. Leavey ]  
                Simon !         
Yes, ma'am ?                    

426
00:29:51,283 --> 00:29:54,952
Don't you feel that you owe     
Reverend Russell an apology ?   

427
00:29:57,089 --> 00:29:59,891
            Simon ?             
I'm thinking.                   

428
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,893
Well, you can just sit there    
and think...                    

429
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,029
    Until you apologize         
    to poor Reverend Russell.   

430
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:07,866
Class dismissed.

After a while, crocodile.

Go on outside, Joe.             

434
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:22,947
                He didn't       
                mean anything.  
Stop making excuses for him.    

435
00:30:23,015 --> 00:30:24,849
If Simon is going to be         
a member of our congregation,   

436
00:30:24,917 --> 00:30:26,817
He has to start behaving        
like a normal person.           

437
00:30:26,885 --> 00:30:31,423
        He is a normal person.

<i>a normal person.</i>

            to apologize ?

about it.

00:30:55,648 --> 00:30:58,683
What do you think               
you're doing                    
sitting in a corner ?

        - In a corner ?

00:31:02,555 --> 00:31:05,222

        But for how long ?      

448
00:31:18,337 --> 00:31:20,772
                    As long     
                    as it takes.

449

                Where's Simon ? 

450
00:31:26,044 --> 00:31:27,979
            Didn't your mother  
            ever teach you...   

451
00:31:28,046 --> 00:31:30,882
            How to keep quiet   
            during mass ?       

452
00:31:32,618 --> 00:31:36,087
                Tsk.  What am   
                I saying ?      

453
00:31:36,154 --> 00:31:39,958
                    Of course

454
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,963
Your parents                    
don't go to church,             
do they, Simon ?                

455
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:49,801
    See, that's because         
    they don't belong here.     

456
00:31:51,871 --> 00:31:54,305
And neither do you.

Speaking out of turn,           
disrupting the class,           

458
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:01,312
    Telling the other children  
    that-- that God has         
    a special plan for you.

                Come on, Simon.

                            Out.

        a lesson.               

464
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:17,794
- [ Rebecca ]  and what lesson  
  is that ?  Humiliation ?      
- Oh, man, this is so boss.     

465
00:32:17,862 --> 00:32:20,630
- This is all my fault.         
- Hey, don't take               
  all the credit.  She's my mom.

466
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:23,334
Telling the children that he's  
some kind of hero.  That he's-- 

467
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:27,171
    That he's God's instrument. 
And who's to say he isn't ?     

468
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:29,273
Who do you think would win      
in a fight ?                    
             <i>Good question.</i>

00:32:29,341 --> 00:32:32,977
    Miss leavey is meaner,      
    but she's a smoker.         
    Your mom could outlast her. 

470
00:32:33,044 --> 00:32:35,412
            We can't have him   
            talking that way.   

471
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,514
            It frightens        
            the other children. 

472
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:39,950
Oh, I think it's you            
it frightens, Miss Leavey.

of little Simon birch ?         

474
