1
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,095
People pay for
what they do...

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,188
and still more for what they
allow themselves to become.

3
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,975
And they pay for it simply; by
the lives they lead. James Baldwin.

4
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:32,714
The day I was born started
off bad and only got worse.

5
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:35,691
I guess I was lucky
I got born at all.

6
00:00:46,837 --> 00:00:49,828
Hey Earle, pass me
another one of those beers.

7
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:54,805
You've had enough already, Travis.
The sun's barely been up an hour.

8
00:00:56,987 --> 00:00:59,335
Jesus, Ruth, would
you quit that?

9
00:00:59,336 --> 00:01:03,124
We're 20 damn miles to the airport
and you're starting already?

10
00:01:03,125 --> 00:01:06,696
The way you're driving we'll
be lucky if we get there at all.

11
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:10,902
Could you two cool it and shut up,
you're going to wake the baby up.

12
00:01:10,903 --> 00:01:12,723
Yeah... which one?

13
00:01:13,426 --> 00:01:16,840
My little sister.
That's the one, smartass.

14
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:43,954
Ruth, what did you do
with my damn cigarettes?

15
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:46,858
Hey Earle, got
any more smokes?

16
00:01:47,103 --> 00:01:50,891
- No I don't, you want to know why?
- Why?

17
00:01:51,821 --> 00:01:54,287
You smoked them
all, that's why.

18
00:02:00,923 --> 00:02:02,323
Oh shit!

19
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:32,389
When Travis smashed into the pickup, the
Chevy folded up like an old accordion.

20
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:37,426
It's a wonder they weren't all
killed. The drinking must have helped.

21
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:40,872
He's a liar. It
was his fault.

22
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:43,092
The truck was just there.

23
00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:08,458
Mama didn't know what hit her, even
though she went through the windshield.

24
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,995
She slept through
the whole thing.

25
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:12,663
Lucky that way.

26
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,973
Can't you hold them, Wade?

27
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,560
I am Ruth from my Aunt, and
Anne from my Mama. Ruth-Anne.

28
00:03:49,994 --> 00:03:52,837
I got the nickname
Bone from Uncle Earle.

29
00:03:52,838 --> 00:03:58,274
He took one look at me and said, "She
ain't no bigger than a knucklebone."

30
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,711
Neither aunt Ruth nor Granny
could write very clearly...

31
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:15,639
and they hadn't bothered to
discuss how Anne would be spelled.

32
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,497
So it wound up three
different ways on the form.

33
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:22,189
As for the name of the father,
Granny refused to speak it...

34
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:25,462
after she'd run him out of town
for messing with her daughter.

35
00:04:25,463 --> 00:04:28,195
Aunt Ruth had never been
sure of his last name anyway.

36
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:31,320
They tried to get away with
just scribbling something down...

37
00:04:31,321 --> 00:04:34,346
but if the hospital didn't mind how
a baby's middle name was spelled...

38
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:37,220
they were definite about
having a father's last name.

39
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:41,277
Granny gave one, Ruth gave
another, the clerk got mad...

40
00:04:42,087 --> 00:04:47,235
and there I was, certified a desgraçad
by the state of South Carolina.

41
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:53,862
Ruth-Anne's alright but
Mattie-Raylene would've been better.

42
00:04:53,863 --> 00:04:55,879
Of course, nobody
bothered to ask me.

43
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,856
Nobody bothered to ask you? Nobody
bothered to ask me. It's my baby.

44
00:05:00,897 --> 00:05:03,653
That's your own damn fault
for sleeping three whole days.

45
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,675
I had a concussion, Mama!

46
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:11,511
How many babies I had, and did I sleep
through any of them? I don't think so.

47
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:16,127
What's that mangy
dog doing in the yard?

48
00:05:16,128 --> 00:05:18,509
You ought to get Earle
to shoot that dog, Mama.

49
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:21,024
It's probably got
rabies or something.

50
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:25,366
Listen, kid. You aren't the first
Boatwright to go through a windshield.

51
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,870
None of this would have
happened if I'd been awake.

52
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:29,775
They don't ask you
for a marriage license

53
00:05:29,776 --> 00:05:31,436
before they put
you on the table.

54
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,841
I'd have said I was married
and they'd have believed me.

55
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:38,007
The way I'd have said
it. No questions, no lies.

56
00:05:38,127 --> 00:05:41,344
No lies? You aren't married.

57
00:05:41,464 --> 00:05:44,311
It's only when you bring it to their
attention that they write it down!

58
00:05:44,312 --> 00:05:46,773
You know anybody who reads
those courthouse records?

59
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:50,319
Anybody who comes onto my porch and
asks to see my birth certificate...

60
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,539
would get chased out of here. I
might even take a shot at them.

61
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,246
Well it matters to me.

62
00:05:56,335 --> 00:06:01,154
Why, you want something on your
wall to prove you've done it right?

63
00:06:01,155 --> 00:06:06,018
A child's proof enough, there ain't
no stamp on her that nobody can see.

64
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:11,215
I don't care what they say, Bone.
I won't have anybody call you trash.

65
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,686
That stamp on your birth certificate,
it's one they already got for me.

66
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,515
No good. Lazy. Shiftless.

67
00:06:25,502 --> 00:06:28,150
I work my ass off over
other people's peanuts...

68
00:06:28,151 --> 00:06:31,877
and they look at me like
I'm a rock on the ground.

69
00:06:31,878 --> 00:06:36,194
No matter how hard I try, I
still can't get away from it.

70
00:06:36,635 --> 00:06:40,251
One soft-talking,
black-eyed man fixed that.

71
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:46,312
He set a mark on me.
And set a mark on you.

72
00:06:50,359 --> 00:06:56,282
Don't you worry, Bone. You've
got me now, and I've got you.

73
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:01,841
We'll stick together,
the two of us.

74
00:07:30,619 --> 00:07:32,439
Let's go see Mama.

75
00:07:34,611 --> 00:07:36,181
Why thank-you, Earle.

76
00:07:36,182 --> 00:07:38,002
My pleasure, Judy.

77
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,266
Hey hey, how's my
little sweetie-pie?

78
00:07:45,239 --> 00:07:46,639
Sweet as ever

79
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,406
You watch yourself, that's my
sister you're talking about.

80
00:07:51,522 --> 00:07:54,431
I just don't understand why
you don't let me go with you.

81
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,214
I could pretend
that I'm her Daddy.

82
00:07:56,215 --> 00:07:57,863
- In a courthouse?!
- Yeah.

83
00:07:57,864 --> 00:08:01,157
Come on, Earle, with all the
deputies and sheriffs hanging around?

84
00:08:01,158 --> 00:08:04,767
Fresh out of the county farm for
shooting up your brother-in-law's Chevy,

85
00:08:04,768 --> 00:08:06,847
you think they won't
know who you are?

86
00:08:06,848 --> 00:08:11,939
You got kids running around Greenville
County, but Bone ain't one of them.

87
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,002
OK.

88
00:08:15,276 --> 00:08:18,202
Here we go, you're
going over to Mama.

89
00:08:19,393 --> 00:08:23,189
Here we go, Bone. You put
on a good show for Mama.

90
00:08:29,042 --> 00:08:34,682
Let me see if I heard you correctly.
You said you want this fixed?

91
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,385
That's right, I was there
and really it was my fault.

92
00:08:39,578 --> 00:08:44,921
I couldn't find her husband. And there
was so much excitement I just got confused.

93
00:08:44,922 --> 00:08:46,468
Just very confused...

94
00:08:46,565 --> 00:08:50,184
what with Anney here all bloody
looking like she was dead to the world.

95
00:08:50,185 --> 00:08:52,573
She went right through
that windshield, you know.

96
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,415
Nine months gone,
imagine that.

97
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,043
There were people hollering, running
around, screaming and, well...

98
00:09:00,044 --> 00:09:04,430
We just thank the good Lord
she's still here with us today.

99
00:09:05,763 --> 00:09:08,563
You know how these
things can happen.

100
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:11,705
I do. I certainly do.

101
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:33,353
You shouldn't have swung at
him, Ruth, it didn't help.

102
00:09:43,698 --> 00:09:45,667
I've got us a man, Bone.

103
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,800
A real man.

104
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:53,778
He's handsome and
kind, hard-working.

105
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:59,604
He's going to take care of
us girls, I know he will.

106
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:06,675
So you wish me
luck, sweetie.

107
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,691
OK, good luck.

108
00:10:17,744 --> 00:10:18,864
Well?

109
00:10:31,838 --> 00:10:34,374
- Thank-you ma'am.
- Thanks, Mama!

110
00:10:45,738 --> 00:10:50,022
In sickness and in health,
till death do you part.

111
00:10:50,576 --> 00:10:51,660
I do.

112
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:56,706
And do you, Anney, take this man
to be your lawful wedded husband...

113
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,982
To have and to hold, for richer or
poorer, in sickness and in health...

114
00:11:03,568 --> 00:11:05,388
Till death do you part.

115
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:06,812
I do.

116
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:12,051
I now pronounce you husband and
wife, you may kiss the bride.

117
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:32,797
- Hey, Bone, who's your new daddy?
- You are.

118
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:37,513
- And who's the best daddy in the world?
- You are!

119
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:41,685
You've got that right.
You want to go again?

120
00:11:49,247 --> 00:11:50,647
You're flying!

121
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:56,012
Honey-girl? Sweet thing,
take a picture of me and Bone.

122
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:03,520
Bone and her daddy. He's going
to be a new daddy really soon.

123
00:12:22,979 --> 00:12:24,737
Really sorry
about that, Lyle

124
00:12:24,738 --> 00:12:27,914
- You're running late.
- You're telling me.

125
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,318
I've got my pickup here
if you need any help.

126
00:13:34,319 --> 00:13:35,719
We're OK.

127
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:41,759
He wasn't doing
nothing wrong,

128
00:13:41,838 --> 00:13:44,282
just came along
after it'd rained.

129
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:46,103
The Devil's rain.

130
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:50,825
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

131
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,337
I will fear no evil:

132
00:13:52,338 --> 00:13:56,372
For thou art with me; thy rod
and thy staff they comfort me.

133
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,958
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies:

134
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,835
thou anointest my head with
oil; my cup runneth over.

135
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:08,331
Surely goodness and loving kindness
shall follow me all the days of my life;

136
00:14:08,332 --> 00:14:12,548
And I shall dwell in the house
of Jehovah for ever. Amen.

137
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,665
Come on.

138
00:14:24,796 --> 00:14:28,222
My Lyle worked two damn jobs
for you, Anney Boatwright.

139
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:30,896
He wouldn't have died in the road
like that if it hadn't been for you.

140
00:14:30,897 --> 00:14:32,199
How dare you?

141
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,815
Trying to keep
you people up.

142
00:14:34,816 --> 00:14:38,852
You hold your tongue, woman.
God's got his eye on you.

143
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,402
You've got no right to
judge us, no right at all.

144
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:58,697
Nothing else will
ever hit you this hard.

145
00:14:58,698 --> 00:15:02,854
Now you look like a Boatwright,
now you've got the look.

146
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:07,047
You're as old as you're
ever going get, girl.

147
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,784
This is the way you'll
look till the day you die.

148
00:15:14,106 --> 00:15:17,086
I tell you what, it wouldn't be
nothing for me to go over there

149
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,893
and teach those people a little
something about manners and respect.

150
00:15:19,894 --> 00:15:23,964
Earle, you can't solve everything
with a shotgun. My Lord.

151
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:26,907
I was thinking more along
the lines of a two-by-four.

152
00:15:26,908 --> 00:15:31,094
Settle yourself, Earle. Nobody's
going over there and that's that.

153
00:15:31,095 --> 00:15:35,651
Since when did you start telling
me what I can and can't do, Raylene?

154
00:15:35,652 --> 00:15:38,675
Anney will stay here with
Mama as long as she needs to.

155
00:15:38,676 --> 00:15:42,187
We take care of our
own, like we always have.

156
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:51,556
This here's our Daddy, practically
every day we'd go on a picnic

157
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,597
and he'd throw me
all over the field.

158
00:15:53,598 --> 00:15:55,262
That's not your Daddy, Bone.

159
00:15:55,263 --> 00:15:57,407
Your Daddy got
run out of town.

160
00:15:57,408 --> 00:15:59,096
Uncle Earle
nearly killed him.

161
00:15:59,097 --> 00:16:00,403
like? the nigger.

162
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:02,901
You listen up, Garvey.

163
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:05,451
I'm going to tell you something
I've been keeping from you...

164
00:16:05,452 --> 00:16:07,723
because the grown-ups don't
want you to know about it.

165
00:16:07,724 --> 00:16:09,824
Because it might scare you.

166
00:16:11,223 --> 00:16:14,790
When you and Grey were just as big
as Reese, sleeping in your cribs...

167
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:18,508
a man came riding into
Greenville County on a horse.

168
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:23,398
Only, he didn't have a
head, and he wasn't alive.

169
00:16:23,618 --> 00:16:25,898
The living dead,
they called him.

170
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,340
He went peering in through
all the windows at night...

171
00:16:28,341 --> 00:16:30,601
looking for a boy
ugly enough to steal.

172
00:16:30,602 --> 00:16:34,620
He couldn't tell which of you
were uglier, so he took you both.

173
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:37,463
You don't remember because
you were too little...

174
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:41,790
but he liked them plump and
ugly and you two fit the bill.

175
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,445
He took you to a shack in the
woods to make stew out of you.

176
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,898
When Uncle Earle showed up,
he had a knife to your ear...

177
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:53,405
he likes little boy's ears in
stew. Tastes good on a biscuit.

178
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,067
Granny!

179
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,372
Have a nice night.

180
00:17:01,693 --> 00:17:03,513
A regular Rockefeller.

181
00:17:05,828 --> 00:17:08,522
I'll marry you Anney,
then Bone would be alright.

182
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:11,078
Anney and her girls have
been alone for four years...

183
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:13,781
one more day without
you won't kill them.

184
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,014
And you're already
married, Billy.

185
00:17:16,015 --> 00:17:17,415
Aren't we all?

186
00:17:17,735 --> 00:17:20,999
I've worked harder in a day than
you have your entire life, Wade.

187
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,806
Strong as an ox,
I'll give her that.

188
00:17:24,313 --> 00:17:25,757
Hey girls.

189
00:17:27,032 --> 00:17:28,152
Hi!

190
00:17:30,211 --> 00:17:31,297
There she is.

191
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:34,963
Her? That's your sister?

192
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,029
That pretty little
white-headed thing?

193
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:39,670
Hey, you gotta watch
yourself around Anney,

194
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:44,327
you say the wrong thing and she'll
take the shine off your teeth.

195
00:17:44,328 --> 00:17:46,904
She ain't any
bigger than a girl.

196
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:49,610
She's a girl alright.

197
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:54,287
Our sweet Mama's baby-girl.
But our Mama is a rattlesnake...

198
00:17:54,288 --> 00:17:57,296
and our Daddy was
a son-of-a-bitch.

199
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,680
What are you going to do with that
certificate, after you've paid for it?

200
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:04,139
Put it under the sink with all
the other trash, where it belongs.

201
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,514
Stop thinking about it, Anney,
then everyone else will too.

202
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:11,131
As long as it keeps getting a rise
out of you, people will keep using it.

203
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:14,014
Your shame is between
you and God, Sister Anne.

204
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:15,784
No need to let it
mark your child.

205
00:18:15,785 --> 00:18:18,362
I've got no shame,
Brother Calvin.

206
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:22,739
And I don't need a man to tell
me anything about my child.

207
00:18:32,728 --> 00:18:35,594
I'll be right back
to get your order.

208
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,740
OK.

209
00:18:39,738 --> 00:18:41,558
What did I tell you?

210
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:47,242
Say something boy,
you're making me nervous.

211
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,550
That's some girl.

212
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,804
I'd say somebody's
smitten with you.

213
00:18:52,805 --> 00:18:55,561
Shut up, Earle would kill him
before we even catch his name.

214
00:18:55,562 --> 00:18:59,888
Earle won't kill him. He
brought him down here, didn't he?

215
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:07,302
He's pretty cute, I wonder if he
can smile. You do need a husband.

216
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:11,643
Yeah, and a house, a car and
a hundred-thousand dollars.

217
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:23,312
He's still looking.
Looking pretty good.

218
00:19:51,216 --> 00:19:54,932
Mama, I've got somebody
I want you to meet.

219
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:57,325
What in God's name is that?

220
00:19:57,467 --> 00:20:02,106
It's a side of beef, Ruth.
Looks like you could use some.

221
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,632
Evening ma'am.

222
00:20:05,482 --> 00:20:07,589
Mama, this is Glen.

223
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:09,589
He works with
me at the mill.

224
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,216
Where would you like me
to put this meat, ma'am?

225
00:20:14,573 --> 00:20:19,211
Did you steal it? Cause if you
did, don't bring it into my house...

226
00:20:19,212 --> 00:20:20,900
I don't need no trouble.

227
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:23,897
No, Mama, Glen's
bringing you a present.

228
00:20:24,105 --> 00:20:28,301
Won't you just take it, it's
a present from him to you.

229
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:33,181
Where are we going to put it?
It won't fit in the icebox.

230
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,358
I'll help him.

231
00:20:41,864 --> 00:20:44,099
They think they can ask
you personal questions

232
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,957
just cause you served
them with a cup of coffee.

233
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:48,358
Yankees.

234
00:20:48,896 --> 00:20:52,702
This one man, he took out
a whole stack of napkins.

235
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:55,340
I was sure he was
going to steal them.

236
00:20:55,341 --> 00:20:58,238
I've seen people open
napkins up like diapers,

237
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,162
fill them with sugar
and walk out with them.

238
00:21:01,163 --> 00:21:04,476
But you know what he
did? He wrote on them.

239
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:08,293
For thirty minutes, one
napkin after another.

240
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:12,077
Then he just balled them
all up and threw them away.

241
00:21:12,078 --> 00:21:16,304
And right by the register, we
sell notepads for ten cents.

242
00:21:17,258 --> 00:21:19,674
What is wrong
with these people?

243
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:28,144
I think you're the most
beautiful woman I've ever seen.

244
00:21:34,548 --> 00:21:36,648
Is it OK that I said that?

245
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,191
It's OK.

246
00:22:25,292 --> 00:22:27,815
Let him go now.

247
00:22:31,249 --> 00:22:32,976
Honest fight, Officer.

248
00:22:33,096 --> 00:22:35,514
You're a Boatwright, you
don't need any more trouble.

249
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,859
You! You'd better
keep your nose clean.

250
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,372
Fair fight, it was fair.

251
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:42,575
Your Daddy would be ashamed of you,
beating on a man and crossing the law.

252
00:22:42,576 --> 00:22:44,676
I'm not crossing any law.

253
00:22:51,773 --> 00:22:53,628
Damn! You're crazy.

254
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:56,373
Come on old boy? and
you smile at him...

255
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,555
another one laughs and
you nearly kill him.

256
00:22:58,556 --> 00:23:01,833
Go and get the truck.
Clean yourself up.

257
00:23:13,845 --> 00:23:18,405
Hey Bone, I've got somebody
that wants to meet you.

258
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:22,631
Bone, this is Glen
Waddell. Say hey.

259
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:23,538
Hey.

260
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:26,249
Hey Bone, how're you doing?

261
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,651
Fine.

262
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:31,497
Do you sit out
here every night?

263
00:23:31,812 --> 00:23:33,212
After school.

264
00:23:34,526 --> 00:23:37,002
Is that your
little sister there?

265
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,687
She's a little
sleeping beauty.

266
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:52,032
Well, sure was
nice to meet you.

267
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,903
See you again sometime.

268
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:01,452
Yes, Sir.

269
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,256
Those sure are
some pretty girls.

270
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,816
He's kind of nice, isn't he?

271
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:13,678
Sure he is.

272
00:24:13,778 --> 00:24:16,234
OK sit tight,
I'll be a minute.

273
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:19,311
Hey you.

274
00:24:20,137 --> 00:24:21,257
Hey.

275
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:32,107
Bone, shut me in.

276
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:43,019
Granny, something's
burning! Something big.

277
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,632
I can't believe it.

278
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:15,432
Come on! Gimme!

279
00:25:15,552 --> 00:25:17,838
- I want to do it!
- Come on!

280
00:25:17,896 --> 00:25:19,716
One, two, three.

281
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:47,005
So he bought you a shirt,
that don't mean anything.

282
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:50,706
Glen loves me, Mama.
He loves my girls.

283
00:26:53,151 --> 00:26:55,677
You just don't
like the Waddells.

284
00:26:56,268 --> 00:26:59,131
That whole family's stuck
up, full of themselves.

285
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:00,467
Glen's not like that.

286
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:03,444
You don't know what
that boy's like, Anney.

287
00:27:03,445 --> 00:27:05,265
I know he loves me.

288
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:08,607
"Love", can't even hold a
job for more than a month.

289
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:10,428
That's not true.

290
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:16,336
Glen's been working with Earle at the
mill for eight months now. Ask Earle!

291
00:27:17,843 --> 00:27:20,053
There's something wrong
with that boy, Anney.

292
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:24,383
He's always looking at me oiy of the sides
of his eyes, like some old junkyard dog...

293
00:27:24,384 --> 00:27:27,470
trying to steal a bone. And
you're the bone he wants.

294
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,940
So? What's wrong with that?

295
00:27:30,471 --> 00:27:32,509
You want me to spend
the rest of my life

296
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:37,776
working my ass off until I dry up
and can't even imagine marrying again?

297
00:27:37,968 --> 00:27:40,774
Earle says he's
got a temper on him.

298
00:27:40,884 --> 00:27:42,704
Earle's one to talk.

299
00:27:43,939 --> 00:27:47,915
Besides, do you know a man
who doesn't have a temper?

300
00:27:55,750 --> 00:28:01,077
Bone! Glen's here. Oh
you both look so pretty.

301
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:10,409
Bone, one for
you one for Reese.

302
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:11,425
Alright.

303
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:29,504
- Anney?
- What?

304
00:28:31,161 --> 00:28:32,281
Anney.

305
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:35,675
Anney.

306
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,775
You know.

307
00:28:39,827 --> 00:28:41,413
You know I love you.

308
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:46,467
I can't wait no more.

309
00:28:47,382 --> 00:28:48,782
I can't.

310
00:28:50,264 --> 00:28:52,960
I love you with
all my heart, girl.

311
00:28:53,992 --> 00:28:55,812
And your girls,

312
00:28:57,303 --> 00:28:59,006
God, I love them.

313
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,805
Our girls.

314
00:29:03,425 --> 00:29:05,245
Our girls, Anney.

315
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,036
Call me Daddy.

316
00:29:13,122 --> 00:29:15,938
Call me Daddy cause
I love your Mama.

317
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:18,496
Cause I love you.

318
00:29:20,513 --> 00:29:23,772
I'm going to treat
you right, you'll see.

319
00:29:26,523 --> 00:29:28,343
Don't say no Anney,

320
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:30,929
don't do that to me.

321
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:41,350
I don't know, Glen, it's...

322
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,526
Alright, I'm going
to think about it.

323
00:29:52,037 --> 00:29:53,157
Anney?

324
00:29:54,801 --> 00:29:57,621
OK, alright.

325
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:14,560
Come on out
here, girls! God!

326
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,600
I knew you'd say yes!

327
00:30:17,866 --> 00:30:20,491
Oh Anney, what you do to me!

328
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:23,793
You've never even
imagined, Anney.

329
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:48,953
- Hey, Bone.
- Hey.

330
00:30:49,391 --> 00:30:51,211
Are you sleeping?

331
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:56,693
You're starting to look like
me, Bone. You're growing up.

332
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:03,383
What do you think, honey?

333
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:06,703
Think I'm doing
the right thing?

334
00:31:07,831 --> 00:31:09,231
I don't know.

335
00:31:11,112 --> 00:31:12,512
I think I am.

336
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,270
I hope I am.

337
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:21,924
Sometimes I just get
so tired, you know.

338
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:27,276
Sometimes I just want
somebody strong to stand by me.

339
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,310
Stay with me.

340
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:32,805
I'll stay with you.

341
00:31:35,307 --> 00:31:37,127
I know you will, Bone.

342
00:31:48,846 --> 00:31:53,422
You'd better hurry up and get
married before you start showing!

343
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:56,016
This dress is too tight.

344
00:32:03,425 --> 00:32:07,838
It ain't right, his own brother
turning him down to be best man.

345
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:10,315
That's because he isn't
the best man, Mama.

346
00:32:10,316 --> 00:32:12,136
I'm the best man.

347
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:16,403
Come on boys, let the girls
say goodbye to their Mama.

348
00:32:33,297 --> 00:32:37,641
Oh honey, don't cry. I'll
be home before you know it.

349
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:42,819
And then you'll have a new
Daddy, and we'll be a family.

350
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:50,573
Right?

351
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,102
Now you be happy
for me, sugar.

352
00:32:58,103 --> 00:32:59,223
I am.

353
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:11,045
Why can't we go,
Bone? Why can't we?

354
00:33:13,601 --> 00:33:15,897
Because it ain't
for children.

355
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,084
What are you doing, Earle?

356
00:33:49,757 --> 00:33:52,753
Giving you a chance
to change your mind.

357
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:57,430
Hellfire, Earle, I'm not
going to change my mind.

358
00:33:57,431 --> 00:33:59,647
I've got a man who loves me.

359
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,567
He loves you alright...

360
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,744
Like a gambler loves a fast racehorse,
or a desperate man loves whiskey.

361
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,565
You're just jealous.

362
00:34:16,281 --> 00:34:17,681
Maybe I am.

363
00:34:32,161 --> 00:34:34,967
You keep it, it'll
do you some good.

364
00:34:39,144 --> 00:34:41,450
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

365
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:48,085
It's going to be a boy, I'm
telling you. Glen Junior.

366
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:51,162
Well, hot damn, Glen.
Congratulations, boy!

367
00:34:54,251 --> 00:34:57,757
Oh, to hell with you.
To hell with all of you.

368
00:34:59,637 --> 00:35:03,638
I tell you, never come between
a man and his ambitions.

369
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:06,370
Anney gives him anything but a
boy he's going to go plumb crazy.

370
00:35:06,371 --> 00:35:09,554
Well a man should never put his
ambitions in a woman's belly.

371
00:35:09,555 --> 00:35:13,265
Me, I don't trust a man
who won't take a drink.

372
00:35:14,727 --> 00:35:17,615
Hell, that'd serve him right
if she gave him another girl.

373
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:22,600
I'm hoping Anney does give him a son.
A half-dozen sons while she's at it.

374
00:35:22,601 --> 00:35:26,490
There's something about that
Glen. I almost like him...

375
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:31,747
but I've got a feeling the boy could
turn like whiskey in a bad barrel.

376
00:35:32,148 --> 00:35:35,235
- Hey smart girls.
- Hey Mama.

377
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:40,143
Sweetheart, I've
got you something.

378
00:35:41,612 --> 00:35:43,432
Thank you, baby.

379
00:35:44,315 --> 00:35:45,715
Give me that.

380
00:35:51,169 --> 00:35:53,045
I'm making you a horsey.

381
00:36:09,021 --> 00:36:11,036
Hey, Bone!

382
00:36:15,718 --> 00:36:18,319
Come sit with me, come on.

383
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:26,735
Here.

384
00:36:36,396 --> 00:36:41,122
The doctor says it's going to
be a while, but she's doing fine.

385
00:36:45,496 --> 00:36:47,142
I know she's worried.

386
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:52,309
She thinks if it's a
girl I won't love it.

387
00:36:54,394 --> 00:36:56,214
It'd still be our baby.

388
00:37:01,349 --> 00:37:03,515
Even if she did have a girl,

389
00:37:05,551 --> 00:37:07,847
we'd have another
soon enough.

390
00:37:10,918 --> 00:37:12,738
I'll have my son.

391
00:37:17,163 --> 00:37:20,671
Anney and I, we'll have
our little baby boy.

392
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:27,627
I know it.

393
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:30,821
I just know it.

394
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,066
Come here.

395
00:37:42,777 --> 00:37:45,013
Your Mama's
going be alright.

396
00:37:48,569 --> 00:37:50,389
And I love you Bone.

397
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:54,279
I know you don't
believe me, but I do.

398
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,896
We're going to be happy.

399
00:38:19,414 --> 00:38:20,814
Real happy.

400
00:38:23,992 --> 00:38:26,468
Everything's going
to be alright.

401
00:39:29,452 --> 00:39:31,270
Get in the back, Bone.

402
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:33,210
Go on, go to sleep.

403
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:30,868
Your Mama's going
to be alright.

404
00:40:33,941 --> 00:40:36,577
But she won't have
no more babies.

405
00:40:41,683 --> 00:40:44,090
My baby's dead.

406
00:40:47,511 --> 00:40:48,911
My boy.

407
00:40:55,646 --> 00:40:56,766
My boy.

408
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:08,495
For the things which
are not seen are eternal.

409
00:41:09,065 --> 00:41:12,771
Now may the peace of God, which
surpasses all understanding...

410
00:41:12,772 --> 00:41:16,182
so guide your hearts and
your thoughts in Christ Jesus.

411
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,539
Now in glory,
forever and ever.

412
00:41:19,478 --> 00:41:22,343
And may the grace of god in
communion with the sweet fellowship...

413
00:41:22,344 --> 00:41:26,547
of the holy spirit go and rest
upon us throughout this day.

414
00:41:26,548 --> 00:41:29,103
In Jesus' name, amen.

415
00:41:40,627 --> 00:41:42,027
We're moving.

416
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:44,892
What? Where?

417
00:41:45,268 --> 00:41:48,104
I found us a place over
by the JC Penney mill.

418
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,949
Why? What's wrong
with this place?

419
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:54,203
Damn you, Glen Waddell.

420
00:41:54,323 --> 00:41:56,899
Don't you take
Anney so far away.

421
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:01,232
It's alright, Alma.

422
00:42:03,198 --> 00:42:05,298
It's going to be alright.

423
00:42:07,534 --> 00:42:10,579
You want to help me
move? Get packing?

424
00:42:12,039 --> 00:42:13,793
What? What?

425
00:42:13,913 --> 00:42:19,039
We don't need nobody else's help,
we're going to do fine on our own.

426
00:42:21,528 --> 00:42:22,648
OK?

427
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:25,467
Alright.

428
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:28,096
Let me get started then.

429
00:42:53,511 --> 00:42:55,282
Where's your Mama?

430
00:42:55,402 --> 00:42:56,802
Sleeping.

431
00:42:57,827 --> 00:42:59,533
What've you got there?

432
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:01,050
A picture.

433
00:43:01,170 --> 00:43:02,570
Let me see it.

434
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,396
Now, Bone,

435
00:43:21,148 --> 00:43:22,968
this ain't your Daddy.

436
00:43:24,195 --> 00:43:26,015
I'm your Daddy, Bone.

437
00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:30,869
Reese, honey.

438
00:43:31,378 --> 00:43:32,795
Tell me I'm your Daddy.

439
00:43:32,796 --> 00:43:33,916
Daddy.

440
00:43:35,062 --> 00:43:36,462
That's right.

441
00:43:38,486 --> 00:43:39,886
Now you do it.

442
00:43:42,884 --> 00:43:44,004
Say it.

443
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:47,318
Call me your daddy.

444
00:43:49,474 --> 00:43:50,594
Daddy.

445
00:44:06,317 --> 00:44:07,962
What's going on?

446
00:44:08,082 --> 00:44:09,668
Where's Bone off to?

447
00:44:10,288 --> 00:44:12,388
She's taking a little walk.

448
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:15,091
That child's moody as hell.

449
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:13,534
I don't know why
they fired me,

450
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:16,615
I was doing everything
I was supposed to.

451
00:45:16,616 --> 00:45:18,436
I've got three sons.

452
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:21,769
One's a lawyer,
finest around, going

453
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,189
to be district
attorney some day.

454
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,573
Another one is a
dentist with the

455
00:45:26,574 --> 00:45:29,306
biggest practice in
Greenville County.

456
00:45:29,437 --> 00:45:31,537
They make their Daddy proud.

457
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,600
And then I've got you.

458
00:45:41,389 --> 00:45:42,973
When are you going to do

459
00:45:42,974 --> 00:45:45,414
something to make
your Daddy proud?

460
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:47,411
I'll tell you when, never.

461
00:45:47,485 --> 00:45:50,036
You come here looking for a
job? Is that why you are here?

462
00:45:50,037 --> 00:45:51,062
Yes.

463
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:54,772
No Sir.

464
00:45:59,864 --> 00:46:03,040
Other boys are getting
laid off too, honey.

465
00:46:03,211 --> 00:46:05,702
Maybe you ought to ask James
for that money he owes you,

466
00:46:05,703 --> 00:46:07,539
for the work you
did on his porch.

467
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:10,342
I can't do that.
I'd rather starve.

468
00:46:10,462 --> 00:46:11,664
But he owes you.

469
00:46:11,665 --> 00:46:13,821
I told you I can't do that.

470
00:46:14,157 --> 00:46:16,056
I know it's hard, Glen,

471
00:46:17,111 --> 00:46:19,057
but James is your brother.

472
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:21,521
We ain't gonna have the rent
if you don't get it from him.

473
00:46:21,522 --> 00:46:23,290
You don't understand.

474
00:46:25,302 --> 00:46:28,828
James never said nothing
about paying me at all.

475
00:46:29,802 --> 00:46:32,668
Hell, he didn't
even ask for my help.

476
00:46:32,727 --> 00:46:35,363
I just went over
there and did it.

477
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:39,737
I never asked about
money, I couldn't.

478
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,713
Well, we'll just see then.

479
00:46:47,613 --> 00:46:50,993
There's other things
we can do, other jobs.

480
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:56,072
We can get Earle's
help to move.

481
00:46:57,205 --> 00:47:01,101
After that, things seemed
to move irreversibly forward.

482
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,584
We moved and moved again.

483
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:07,630
We lived in no one house
more than eight months.

484
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,896
Moving had no season,
it was all seasons.

485
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:16,070
Crossed time like a
train with no schedule.

486
00:47:16,071 --> 00:47:19,155
We moved so often our
mail never caught up to us,

487
00:47:19,156 --> 00:47:22,496
moved some times before
we've even got unpacked,

488
00:47:22,497 --> 00:47:27,113
or I'd learned the names of all
the teachers in my new school.

489
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:37,905
Moving gave me sense of time
passing and everything sliding...

490
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,985
as if nothing could
be held onto anyway.

491
00:47:41,131 --> 00:47:45,778
It made me feel, ghostly
unreal, unimportant.

492
00:47:45,898 --> 00:47:47,930
Like a box that
goes missing,

493
00:47:47,931 --> 00:47:49,928
turns up but you realize you

494
00:47:49,929 --> 00:47:52,567
never needed
anything in it anyway.

495
00:47:53,555 --> 00:47:55,371
What the hell is this?

496
00:47:55,491 --> 00:47:59,017
Earle was just trying to
help, Glenn, Good Lord.

497
00:48:01,287 --> 00:48:03,127
How can you shame
me like that?

498
00:48:03,128 --> 00:48:04,570
I'm a grown
man, I don't need

499
00:48:04,571 --> 00:48:06,157
your brother to
pay my damn way.

500
00:48:06,158 --> 00:48:07,944
You give that back
to him tomorrow.

501
00:48:07,945 --> 00:48:10,760
That's crazy, we
need this money.

502
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:12,700
You just do as I say!

503
00:48:13,943 --> 00:48:16,926
Sell the damn radio
while you're at it.

504
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:19,118
Things I do aren't
good enough for you?

505
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,377
I put my hand in
a honey jar, it

506
00:48:21,378 --> 00:48:24,045
comes out piss!
Nothing I do is right!

507
00:48:24,046 --> 00:48:27,990
Everybody has troubles
now and then, honey.

508
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:30,738
You just give it time, sweetie.
Things are going to work out.

509
00:48:30,739 --> 00:48:31,722
Shut up.

510
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:34,131
You shut up. Don't
give me that Mama crap.

511
00:48:34,132 --> 00:48:37,648
You shut your mouth! You
just shut up, shut up!

512
00:48:40,239 --> 00:48:45,185
I'm sorry Anney, you know I don't
mean to yell at you, I'm sorry.

513
00:48:45,754 --> 00:48:49,550
You know how much I love
your Mama, you know I do.

514
00:48:49,614 --> 00:48:50,800
Oh Jesus, Glen.

515
00:48:50,849 --> 00:48:53,375
You don't know
your own strength.

516
00:48:54,718 --> 00:48:56,551
I guess I don't.

517
00:48:56,671 --> 00:49:01,517
But Bone knows I'd never mean to
hurt her. Bone knows I love her.

518
00:49:01,843 --> 00:49:04,708
Hell, Anney! I
love all of you.

519
00:49:05,169 --> 00:49:06,569
You know that.

520
00:49:08,685 --> 00:49:13,285
No, he never meant to hurt
me. Not really, I told myself.

521
00:49:14,794 --> 00:49:19,525
But more and more those hands
seem to move before he could think.

522
00:49:19,526 --> 00:49:22,551
My dreams were full
of long fingers,

523
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,471
hands that reached
around door frames,

524
00:49:25,862 --> 00:49:30,938
crept over the edge of the
mattress, fear in me like a river,

525
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,827
like the ice dark
blue of his eyes.

526
00:49:33,828 --> 00:49:35,507
I'm hungry

527
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:41,380
When we get enough bottles, we'll
get you a can of pork and beans.

528
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:48,426
How come we always gotta eat
pork and beans cold, hein Bone?

529
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:53,129
Because we haven't got electricity.
The power company turned it off

530
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,886
because Daddy Glen
can't keep a job.

531
00:49:56,755 --> 00:49:59,861
How come Daddy Glen
don't like you, Bone?

532
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:04,652
How come you got to keep
asking me a million questions?

533
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:08,210
Making so much
fuss over so little.

534
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:12,925
You'd think you girls
hadn't been fed in a week.

535
00:50:14,051 --> 00:50:16,747
You don't know
what real hunger is.

536
00:50:32,376 --> 00:50:33,496
Go on.

537
00:51:02,994 --> 00:51:04,155
Hey, honey.

538
00:51:04,275 --> 00:51:06,171
Soda crackers and ketchup!

539
00:51:06,181 --> 00:51:07,996
You're so casual
about finding another

540
00:51:07,997 --> 00:51:09,764
job, but I feed my
girls that garbage

541
00:51:09,765 --> 00:51:12,656
while you sit on your ass all
day, smoking and telling lies.

542
00:51:12,657 --> 00:51:14,455
I was out looking
for a job all day.

543
00:51:14,456 --> 00:51:17,332
How many? How many
people did you see?

544
00:51:17,892 --> 00:51:19,012
A lot.

545
00:51:20,013 --> 00:51:21,496
Not my kids.

546
00:51:21,616 --> 00:51:24,130
I was never going to have my
girls know what it was like.

547
00:51:24,131 --> 00:51:27,683
I was never going to have them
go hungry or cold or scared!

548
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,784
Never, you hear me? Never!

549
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:36,746
What's that?

550
00:51:36,866 --> 00:51:38,266
It's a horse.

551
00:51:39,491 --> 00:51:40,998
Do you know what this is?

552
00:51:40,999 --> 00:51:43,025
Bone, you get Reese ready.

553
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:46,034
I'm taking you over to Aunt
Alma's for a little while.

554
00:51:46,035 --> 00:51:47,855
I'll pick you up later.

555
00:52:32,462 --> 00:52:33,862
Come on girls.

556
00:52:34,533 --> 00:52:36,353
We're going home.

557
00:52:39,043 --> 00:52:41,159
Now whose big dress is this?

558
00:52:44,574 --> 00:52:45,974
Reese, baby.

559
00:52:57,935 --> 00:53:00,981
My Mama used to cook
this late at night.

560
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:04,975
You've got to get the tomatoes
almost done before you put the eggs in

561
00:53:04,976 --> 00:53:08,701
because you don't want to
cook the eggs much at all.

562
00:53:08,702 --> 00:53:10,522
You want them soft.

563
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:16,766
You want them to melt like butter
between your teeth and your tongue.

564
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,087
What're you going
to do about it, Glen?

565
00:53:25,088 --> 00:53:26,212
What?

566
00:53:26,627 --> 00:53:28,447
Nothing, that's what.

567
00:53:48,402 --> 00:53:49,522
It's good.

568
00:53:50,191 --> 00:53:52,011
Eat up, baby.

569
00:54:14,878 --> 00:54:18,128
Anney's got her girls
all dolled up today.

570
00:54:29,979 --> 00:54:31,656
James, I figured we'd take

571
00:54:31,657 --> 00:54:34,522
fifty, maybe sixty thousand,
put it in a liquid account,

572
00:54:34,523 --> 00:54:36,178
so we can write
checks on it.

573
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:37,687
- You know, Daddy.
- What?

574
00:54:37,688 --> 00:54:42,410
I got that job, and it's
working out really well.

575
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,014
write checks on, we buy
us a couple of radio spots.

576
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:50,076
We'll make these sort of public service
spots and not use your name at all.

577
00:54:50,077 --> 00:54:52,603
Anne Madeline asked for
another pitcher of tea.

578
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:54,677
Take that one
there on the table.

579
00:54:54,678 --> 00:54:58,562
We don't want to make it look
like we're trying to push you,

580
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:02,863
specifically, well we just want to
say we need a new district attorney.

581
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:05,974
Damn, you clumsy child!

582
00:55:06,225 --> 00:55:07,751
Go on, Bone, go on.

583
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:10,542
- You bring those people around here!
- Daddy, that was an accident!

584
00:55:10,543 --> 00:55:12,842
You bring them around,
watch what they're doing!

585
00:55:12,843 --> 00:55:15,423
- Those people are my family.
- Your family?

586
00:55:15,424 --> 00:55:19,470
We are your family, right
here, boy. We're your family.

587
00:55:26,894 --> 00:55:29,590
You can't hurt me
anymore, old man.

588
00:55:40,654 --> 00:55:44,680
It's my one day off, and
you got to tear around here?

589
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,409
Now just, just cool it, kid.

590
00:55:50,575 --> 00:55:52,981
You're a girl,
not a racehorse.

591
00:55:53,972 --> 00:55:56,378
You're a girl,
not a racehorse.

592
00:55:57,065 --> 00:56:00,421
You little bitch. You
little bitch! Come here!

593
00:56:01,337 --> 00:56:03,512
Come on, you. You're
smart. Get up here.

594
00:56:03,513 --> 00:56:05,979
- Stop it. I'm sorry.
- Come on.

595
00:56:06,936 --> 00:56:09,112
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

596
00:56:12,764 --> 00:56:13,884
Glen?

597
00:56:14,608 --> 00:56:15,728
Glen?

598
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:18,522
Glen, open the door.

599
00:56:19,957 --> 00:56:21,667
Glen, unlock this door!

600
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:22,749
I'm sorry.

601
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:24,860
Not as sorry as
you're going to be.

602
00:56:24,861 --> 00:56:26,117
Glen, please!

603
00:56:26,956 --> 00:56:30,479
Tearing around here,
making fun of me,

604
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:34,253
embarrassing me in
front of my daddy!

605
00:56:35,096 --> 00:56:37,743
I've waited too long
to do this, too long.

606
00:56:37,744 --> 00:56:39,850
What did she do? Let me in!

607
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,010
Stop it!

608
00:56:55,244 --> 00:56:57,064
She's my girl, too!

609
00:56:59,948 --> 00:57:04,334
Someone's got to love her
enough to care how she turns out.

610
00:57:09,756 --> 00:57:11,156
Oh, babycakes.

611
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:26,470
What did you do, honey?

612
00:57:26,471 --> 00:57:29,271
What did you do
to make him so mad?

613
00:57:32,993 --> 00:57:35,469
She called me a
desgraçad, Anney.

614
00:57:37,806 --> 00:57:40,222
And she was
tearing around here,

615
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:42,412
knocking things over.

616
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:49,991
I never meant to beat her that bad,
I swear I didn't. I would never...

617
00:58:00,082 --> 00:58:01,902
I'm sorry, baby.

618
00:58:14,944 --> 00:58:16,344
Don't cry.

619
00:58:17,101 --> 00:58:18,921
You made him mad, Bone.

620
00:58:19,234 --> 00:58:21,060
You'd better be careful.

621
00:58:22,336 --> 00:58:24,582
Come here, you
stubborn thing.

622
00:58:26,311 --> 00:58:27,505
Come on.

623
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:31,731
I had tried to be careful,
but something had come apart.

624
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:35,170
Something had gotten
loose, like wild

625
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:38,057
strands of hair
unraveling in the dust.

626
00:58:41,856 --> 00:58:44,370
He wouldn't make enough
money in his new job,

627
00:58:44,371 --> 00:58:48,658
so Mama went back to the
cafe, working later and later.

628
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:50,178
What is this?

629
00:58:50,519 --> 00:58:53,247
You know where I found this? I found
this on the floor in the hallway.

630
00:58:53,248 --> 00:58:55,000
What did I tell you
I'd do next time?

631
00:58:55,001 --> 00:58:56,465
What did I say about this?

632
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,450
Come on, get up.
Let's go upstairs.

633
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,376
You gotta learn to
take care of things.

634
00:59:00,377 --> 00:59:03,025
That's why your Mama works
so hard. Let's go, let's go.

635
00:59:03,026 --> 00:59:06,680
Reese, you just stay right there,
play your cards. Come on, let's go.

636
00:59:06,681 --> 00:59:11,368
Glen always found something I'd
done, something I had to be told.

637
00:59:11,369 --> 00:59:15,525
Something he just had to do
because he loved me so much.

638
00:59:18,486 --> 00:59:20,652
I lived in a world of shame.

639
00:59:21,189 --> 00:59:26,165
I hid my bruises as if they were
evidence of crimes I had committed.

640
00:59:26,548 --> 00:59:28,368
I didn't tell Mama.

641
00:59:28,642 --> 00:59:30,462
I couldn't tell Mama.

642
00:59:41,168 --> 00:59:43,644
Something's wrong
with her, Glen.

643
00:59:44,751 --> 00:59:46,928
She's just accident-prone.

644
00:59:47,048 --> 00:59:49,704
She's always getting
into something.

645
00:59:49,808 --> 00:59:53,044
Falling out of trees,
falling off the porch.

646
00:59:53,597 --> 00:59:56,397
Lucky she's such
a hard-headed brat.

647
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:00,609
Maybe I ought to get
her some vitamins,

648
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:03,376
or something. Maybe
she's thin-boned.

649
01:00:07,048 --> 01:00:08,448
Don't worry.

650
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:11,426
Mama.

651
01:00:24,279 --> 01:00:25,317
Mama.

652
01:00:27,254 --> 01:00:28,995
How'd she break her coccyx?

653
01:00:28,996 --> 01:00:30,940
- Her what?
- Her tail bone, lady!

654
01:00:30,941 --> 01:00:32,462
Her ass!

655
01:00:32,582 --> 01:00:34,459
What have you been
hitting this child with?

656
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:37,033
Or maybe you've just been throwing
her up against the damn wall!

657
01:00:37,034 --> 01:00:38,613
What are you saying?

658
01:00:38,733 --> 01:00:40,553
What are you saying!

659
01:00:45,417 --> 01:00:47,275
You wanna talk
about it, honey?

660
01:00:47,276 --> 01:00:49,096
Let me have my girl.

661
01:00:54,092 --> 01:00:56,630
How about we ask your
Mama to leave, then

662
01:00:56,631 --> 01:00:59,431
maybe you can tell
me what happened?

663
01:01:00,262 --> 01:01:02,147
- Mama.
- Come on.

664
01:01:02,557 --> 01:01:04,789
I'm getting you dressed
and I'm getting you home.

665
01:01:04,790 --> 01:01:06,514
Lady, this child's
been beaten.

666
01:01:06,515 --> 01:01:11,141
This child's been beaten and I'm
going to call the authorities!

667
01:01:12,693 --> 01:01:14,513
We're over here.

668
01:01:16,482 --> 01:01:20,218
OK here we go, you're
going to be home real soon.

669
01:01:24,859 --> 01:01:26,679
Thank you, doctor.

670
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:32,541
Don't you dare.

671
01:01:56,252 --> 01:01:57,387
Anney.

672
01:01:57,635 --> 01:01:58,755
Anney.

673
01:01:58,999 --> 01:02:00,399
Anney, no!

674
01:02:05,085 --> 01:02:07,611
What in the hell
happened to her?

675
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,015
I'm sorry.

676
01:02:11,124 --> 01:02:13,360
You didn't do
anything wrong.

677
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:16,500
Throw the ball, Garvey!

678
01:02:19,789 --> 01:02:23,065
We stayed at Aunt
Alma's until I got better

679
01:02:23,293 --> 01:02:27,509
but Daddy Glen said he couldn't
live without Mama's love.

680
01:02:27,513 --> 01:02:31,779
She made him swear he would
never lay a hand on me again.

681
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:43,049
Girls? Daddy Glen's here.

682
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:05,398
Bone? I want to ask you
to do something for me.

683
01:03:08,797 --> 01:03:11,673
You know, your Aunt
Ruth is real sick.

684
01:03:11,983 --> 01:03:14,389
Aunt Ruth's been
sick for ages.

685
01:03:15,272 --> 01:03:16,392
Well.

686
01:03:17,491 --> 01:03:19,311
She's gotten worse

687
01:03:20,701 --> 01:03:25,037
and Travis is having a hard time
taking care of her all by himself.

688
01:03:25,038 --> 01:03:28,708
He was wondering if you'd go
out there for a little while

689
01:03:28,709 --> 01:03:30,529
until she gets better.

690
01:03:52,792 --> 01:03:54,628
- Hi, Ruth.
- Hi, honey.

691
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:56,422
Thanks for this.

692
01:03:56,542 --> 01:03:58,792
She's going to be
fine. Just fine.

693
01:03:58,793 --> 01:04:01,253
OK, baby. Bye-bye.

694
01:04:06,539 --> 01:04:10,225
You be good. Take good
care of her, OK? Love you.

695
01:04:11,423 --> 01:04:17,178
I'm gonna take a trip,
on that old gospel ship.

696
01:04:17,298 --> 01:04:21,735
I'm going far
beyond the sky.

697
01:04:23,212 --> 01:04:26,313
I'm gonna shout and sing.

698
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:31,181
You think I'm dying?

699
01:04:31,758 --> 01:04:34,812
No, just awful damn sick.

700
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:36,938
Then what is it, child?

701
01:04:37,915 --> 01:04:39,735
Daddy Glen hates me.

702
01:04:42,436 --> 01:04:46,826
He don't like you much, but
he's just jealous, I think.

703
01:04:47,193 --> 01:04:48,593
Come here.

704
01:04:51,862 --> 01:04:54,662
See, he's just a
little boy himself.

705
01:04:55,557 --> 01:04:58,158
Wanting more of
your Mama than you.

706
01:04:58,159 --> 01:05:01,505
Wanting to be her baby
more than her husband.

707
01:05:01,821 --> 01:05:06,774
Men are just like little boys,
jumping up on titty whenever they can.

708
01:05:06,775 --> 01:05:09,351
Your Mama knows
it and we all do.

709
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:16,006
Has he ever
touched you, honey?

710
01:05:17,728 --> 01:05:19,844
Has he ever messed with you?

711
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:27,346
Down here, honey.

712
01:05:27,620 --> 01:05:30,026
Has he ever hurt
you down here?

713
01:05:36,421 --> 01:05:37,821
Are you sure?

714
01:05:48,507 --> 01:05:51,996
Auntie, do you
believe in god?

715
01:05:52,116 --> 01:05:54,613
I sure as hell do.

716
01:05:54,733 --> 01:05:58,007
Good, because I'll be
a gospel singer someday.

717
01:05:58,008 --> 01:06:02,294
All right, then. Carry on,
little Bone. Turn up that radio.

718
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:05,765
If you are ashamed of me,

719
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:08,253
you ought not to be.

720
01:06:08,373 --> 01:06:13,168
Lest you better have a care.

721
01:06:13,434 --> 01:06:15,680
If too much fault you find,

722
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,173
you will sure
be left behind.

723
01:06:18,293 --> 01:06:23,124
While I'm sailing,
through the air.

724
01:06:23,244 --> 01:06:26,259
Would you quit? You're
scaring off my dogs.

725
01:06:26,260 --> 01:06:29,110
Oh, shut up, old man!
We're full of spirit.

726
01:06:29,111 --> 01:06:33,672
I'm going far beyond the sky

727
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,732
I'm gonna shout and sing

728
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:38,662
till the heavens ring,

729
01:06:38,782 --> 01:06:43,440
till I bid this
world goodbye.

730
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:46,137
Alright then, honey.

731
01:07:07,835 --> 01:07:10,364
I can't believe I got
suckered into coming back home.

732
01:07:10,365 --> 01:07:12,129
What do you mean?

733
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:15,107
Daddy said he'd make my car
payments if I took care of Mama,

734
01:07:15,108 --> 01:07:16,642
so what the hell?

735
01:07:16,762 --> 01:07:19,233
You're talking about your
car when your Mama's dying?

736
01:07:19,234 --> 01:07:20,883
You don't know what
it's like, Bone.

737
01:07:20,884 --> 01:07:23,833
Getting out on your own and
then being dragged back home.

738
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:26,511
You wait a few years.
Get yourself a sweetheart,

739
01:07:26,512 --> 01:07:28,263
a job that pays
your own money,

740
01:07:28,264 --> 01:07:32,369
stuff you like to do that your
Mama says is silly or simple.

741
01:07:32,370 --> 01:07:35,752
Just about everything I like in
this world is silly or simple.

742
01:07:35,753 --> 01:07:37,569
But then, I don't care.

743
01:07:37,667 --> 01:07:40,446
I got my car and
I got my own plans

744
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:44,375
and as soon as that car is paid for,
you can bet your ass I'll be gone again.

745
01:07:44,376 --> 01:07:48,132
Next time, the devil himself
couldn't drag me back.

746
01:07:53,418 --> 01:07:54,538
Bone?

747
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,388
Yes, Auntie?

748
01:07:57,879 --> 01:08:00,705
Turn off that radio,
would you, honey?

749
01:08:07,283 --> 01:08:09,103
Will you sing for me?

750
01:08:19,897 --> 01:08:25,866
I'm gonna take a trip,
on that old gospel ship.

751
01:08:27,114 --> 01:08:31,516
I'm going far
beyond the sky.

752
01:08:34,793 --> 01:08:40,392
I'm gonna shout and sing,
till the heavens ring.

753
01:08:41,132 --> 01:08:46,218
Till I bid this
world goodbye

754
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:49,089
That's nice, honey.

755
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:30,362
Now is the neatest time
Oh now, is the neatest time

756
01:09:59,020 --> 01:10:04,106
Are you trying to take the paint
off the walls or just sour the milk?

757
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:08,491
Bone!

758
01:10:08,896 --> 01:10:11,415
Knock it off, you're giving
your Daddy and me a headache.

759
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,942
But I'm feeling
the spirit, Mama!

760
01:10:29,276 --> 01:10:30,396
Mama?

761
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:32,410
What is it?

762
01:10:35,604 --> 01:10:37,424
Come here, baby.

763
01:10:42,545 --> 01:10:43,945
It's Ruth.

764
01:10:45,256 --> 01:10:46,656
She's gone.

765
01:10:47,575 --> 01:10:48,975
She died?

766
01:10:49,537 --> 01:10:50,657
Mama.

767
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,402
No.

768
01:11:04,561 --> 01:11:05,681
Bone.

769
01:11:06,505 --> 01:11:07,625
Bone.

770
01:11:09,274 --> 01:11:10,972
Bone, what are
you doing up here?

771
01:11:10,973 --> 01:11:13,385
How many times are you going
to make me call you, girl?

772
01:11:13,386 --> 01:11:15,301
- I didn't hear you.
- Didn't hear me?

773
01:11:15,302 --> 01:11:18,410
I've been calling you for 5 minutes,
your Mama needs your help down there.

774
01:11:18,411 --> 01:11:20,123
I didn't hear you.

775
01:11:20,989 --> 01:11:22,455
Don't you sass me.

776
01:11:22,552 --> 01:11:24,372
Don't you dare sass me.

777
01:11:24,614 --> 01:11:28,001
You think just because your aunt
died you can talk to me like that?

778
01:11:28,002 --> 01:11:33,138
You're in my house now. I am the
boss of my house, do you understand?

779
01:11:33,413 --> 01:11:34,806
Of all days, Jesus!

780
01:11:34,807 --> 01:11:36,907
Anney, let me handle this!

781
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:38,666
- Come here.
- No.

782
01:11:38,667 --> 01:11:40,296
Let me handle this!

783
01:11:40,416 --> 01:11:41,536
Glen?

784
01:11:42,104 --> 01:11:45,468
No, Glen. Glen! Glen!

785
01:11:45,588 --> 01:11:46,988
Wait here.

786
01:11:52,815 --> 01:11:54,182
She didn't do anything!

787
01:11:54,183 --> 01:11:57,099
Don't you say a
word. Don't you dare.

788
01:11:57,114 --> 01:11:58,934
Glen, you stop it now!

789
01:12:27,913 --> 01:12:29,632
I appreciate you
coming out here.

790
01:12:29,633 --> 01:12:31,516
Ruthie would have
loved that sermon.

791
01:12:31,517 --> 01:12:34,466
It was short and sweet
and she liked it that way.

792
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:37,116
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

793
01:12:41,326 --> 01:12:43,426
- Hey, Earle.
- Hey, boys.

794
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,853
Hey, Bone!

795
01:12:58,548 --> 01:13:00,374
Come over here a minute.

796
01:13:07,679 --> 01:13:11,004
Here you are. Drink
to your Aunt Ruthie.

797
01:13:11,124 --> 01:13:15,510
Just don't tell your Mama,
though, she'll take my head off.

798
01:13:22,873 --> 01:13:24,693
Easy does it, kiddo.

799
01:13:59,036 --> 01:14:00,856
Oh, I'm sorry, Bone.

800
01:14:03,614 --> 01:14:08,404
Well, girl! Who
slipped you some liquor?

801
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:11,090
You're falling over drunk.

802
01:14:11,420 --> 01:14:14,251
No, I'm not. I
just had a little.

803
01:14:14,371 --> 01:14:16,458
I heard that one before.

804
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:22,167
Come on, let's
get you into a bed.

805
01:14:29,008 --> 01:14:30,021
Oh, Jesus.

806
01:14:30,141 --> 01:14:31,261
Please!

807
01:14:31,608 --> 01:14:34,625
- Oh, no.
- Please! No!

808
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:40,169
Earle, get in here!

809
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:41,810
Bring Wade and
Travis with you!

810
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:43,817
What's the matter, Raylene?

811
01:14:45,139 --> 01:14:47,534
Raylene, what the hell
are you screaming about?

812
01:14:47,535 --> 01:14:49,531
Look at this, look at her.

813
01:14:52,716 --> 01:14:54,116
I'd kill him.

814
01:15:08,779 --> 01:15:10,599
How you like that?

815
01:15:11,732 --> 01:15:13,552
How you feel, big man?

816
01:15:14,287 --> 01:15:17,547
Get up, boy! Get him up!

817
01:15:17,969 --> 01:15:19,789
Bring him! Come here!

818
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:23,312
- Anney.
- Don't touch me!

819
01:15:23,313 --> 01:15:24,794
Look at me.

820
01:15:24,914 --> 01:15:27,014
God damn you. God damn you.

821
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:32,138
He loves Bone. He
loves her. He does.

822
01:15:32,671 --> 01:15:34,491
He loves us all, Mama!

823
01:15:46,066 --> 01:15:47,532
I'm sorry.

824
01:15:47,652 --> 01:15:49,472
Calm down, Anney.

825
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:53,683
I made him mad.

826
01:15:58,114 --> 01:15:59,760
How do you like that?

827
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:01,527
They're going to kill him!

828
01:16:01,528 --> 01:16:02,928
Shut up!

829
01:16:05,339 --> 01:16:07,159
Get him over here!

830
01:16:07,489 --> 01:16:08,889
Set him up.

831
01:16:11,709 --> 01:16:13,529
Turn him around!

832
01:16:14,045 --> 01:16:15,435
Get him on his knees!

833
01:16:15,436 --> 01:16:17,917
Now, move! Out of the way!

834
01:16:18,293 --> 01:16:19,693
You like that?

835
01:16:46,104 --> 01:16:47,924
I hate those people.

836
01:16:48,377 --> 01:16:49,777
How come?

837
01:16:50,204 --> 01:16:54,007
They're always looking at us
like we're something nasty.

838
01:16:54,008 --> 01:16:57,224
They look at you the
way you look at them.

839
01:16:57,359 --> 01:16:59,874
Look at it from the
other side for a while,

840
01:16:59,875 --> 01:17:03,273
maybe you won't be
glaring at people so much.

841
01:17:05,920 --> 01:17:09,426
I heard you ran off to
the carnival with a man

842
01:17:09,826 --> 01:17:13,282
but I never heard you
say one thing about him.

843
01:17:13,624 --> 01:17:15,910
How come he
didn't marry you?

844
01:17:17,788 --> 01:17:22,776
I did run off to the carnival
alright, but not for no man.

845
01:17:23,944 --> 01:17:26,300
I never wanted
to marry nobody.

846
01:17:30,746 --> 01:17:33,962
I like my life the
way it is, little girl.

847
01:17:37,184 --> 01:17:42,640
Looks like you'll make yours out of
pride, stubbornness, and too much anger.

848
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:50,970
Better think hard, Ruth Anne, about
what you want and who you're mad at.

849
01:17:52,326 --> 01:17:54,146
Better think real hard.

850
01:18:01,987 --> 01:18:04,103
Alma's gone berserk. Get in!

851
01:18:04,145 --> 01:18:05,965
Oh, God, come on.

852
01:18:06,856 --> 01:18:08,682
Stay away from my house!

853
01:18:09,544 --> 01:18:11,644
Stay away from my children!

854
01:18:13,098 --> 01:18:14,770
You
son-of-a-bitch.

855
01:18:15,207 --> 01:18:17,307
You stay away from here.

856
01:18:18,709 --> 01:18:21,975
He's going be back,
and I'm ready for him.

857
01:18:23,819 --> 01:18:27,967
"A man has his needs",
that's what he always says.

858
01:18:28,211 --> 01:18:30,797
He's just taking
a breather, Alma.

859
01:18:31,008 --> 01:18:35,250
I'll cut his throat, as
soon as he's done breathing.

860
01:18:36,657 --> 01:18:42,027
I said, "give me a baby,
Wade. Just give me a baby."

861
01:18:43,230 --> 01:18:45,400
You know what he said to me?

862
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:51,226
He wouldn't touch me if I took a bath
in whiskey and put a bag over my head.

863
01:18:52,601 --> 01:18:54,489
I've been thinking.

864
01:18:54,609 --> 01:18:56,009
About what?

865
01:18:56,624 --> 01:19:01,560
Remember when you told me and Garvey
about the living dead? Remember?

866
01:19:03,553 --> 01:19:07,719
I've been thinking maybe our
daddies are the living dead.

867
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,668
I've been thinking maybe
they just take turns.

868
01:19:11,669 --> 01:19:12,789
Maybe.

869
01:19:16,263 --> 01:19:17,663
Hey, Bone.

870
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:20,906
Want to come sit
with me a minute?

871
01:19:24,536 --> 01:19:27,412
How are things going
out at Raylene's?

872
01:19:27,911 --> 01:19:29,031
Fine.

873
01:19:29,848 --> 01:19:32,034
Earle still
staying with you?

874
01:19:32,294 --> 01:19:33,694
Sometimes.

875
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:36,995
Must be nice out
there by the river.

876
01:19:37,083 --> 01:19:38,203
Quiet.

877
01:19:41,474 --> 01:19:45,060
You look like you're
waiting for something, Bone.

878
01:19:46,296 --> 01:19:48,396
What are you waiting for?

879
01:19:50,249 --> 01:19:54,815
I'll be staying here at Alma's,
until things get settled down.

880
01:19:55,789 --> 01:19:58,135
You want to stay
here with me?

881
01:20:05,884 --> 01:20:08,690
I couldn't stand
it if you hated me.

882
01:20:10,079 --> 01:20:11,899
I don't hate you.

883
01:20:12,864 --> 01:20:14,964
I just know you love him.

884
01:20:15,387 --> 01:20:18,303
He's good to you.
He's good to Reese.

885
01:20:19,646 --> 01:20:22,013
He just... I don't know.

886
01:20:24,630 --> 01:20:29,591
I wouldn't ask you to come home
unless I knew you'd be safe, Bone.

887
01:20:30,644 --> 01:20:32,464
I promise you.

888
01:20:36,286 --> 01:20:37,406
What?

889
01:20:38,731 --> 01:20:40,345
What are you saying?

890
01:20:40,465 --> 01:20:41,865
I won't go.

891
01:20:42,885 --> 01:20:44,705
I'll stay at Raylene's.

892
01:20:45,256 --> 01:20:47,652
I think she's
glad to keep me.

893
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,690
I'll stay somewhere.

894
01:20:50,652 --> 01:20:55,128
But once you go back to Daddy
Glen, I can't go with you.

895
01:21:09,251 --> 01:21:10,651
Oh, god.

896
01:21:12,017 --> 01:21:13,837
What have I done?

897
01:21:15,446 --> 01:21:18,852
Mama didn't try to stop
me when I walked away.

898
01:21:18,853 --> 01:21:20,673
She just watched me go.

899
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:25,724
At Raylene's the days
were a gift, long and warm.

900
01:21:26,032 --> 01:21:28,132
The nights, quiet and cool.

901
01:21:28,821 --> 01:21:32,538
I slept dreamlessly
and woke up at peace.

902
01:21:34,187 --> 01:21:36,007
Come on, come here.

903
01:21:36,813 --> 01:21:38,633
Do you like it?

904
01:22:02,634 --> 01:22:04,034
Hey, bone.

905
01:22:08,829 --> 01:22:10,649
It's been a while.

906
01:22:14,211 --> 01:22:16,044
Your Mama here?

907
01:22:16,164 --> 01:22:18,075
She's at Aunt Alma's.

908
01:22:18,195 --> 01:22:20,872
But she's coming over
for some tomatoes.

909
01:22:20,873 --> 01:22:21,993
Good.

910
01:22:23,154 --> 01:22:24,974
I'll wait for her.

911
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:34,546
Where's your Aunt Raylene?

912
01:22:36,430 --> 01:22:37,830
Down fishing.

913
01:22:44,594 --> 01:22:49,730
How about you go inside and make
me a glass of iced tea while I wait?

914
01:23:09,551 --> 01:23:11,371
You are getting bigger.

915
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:15,116
You going be
dating any day, now.

916
01:23:16,344 --> 01:23:17,898
Getting married, maybe.

917
01:23:17,899 --> 01:23:20,195
Starting a family
of your own.

918
01:23:21,321 --> 01:23:24,787
Breaking some man's heart
just because you can.

919
01:23:27,841 --> 01:23:29,661
You're a jumpy girl.

920
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:40,484
I talked to Anney, you know.

921
01:23:41,073 --> 01:23:43,533
She's coming
back. She promised.

922
01:23:44,448 --> 01:23:48,768
Says she just needs a little
time, time to make it up to you.

923
01:23:48,769 --> 01:23:51,825
She loves you more
than I can understand.

924
01:23:52,449 --> 01:23:54,362
You know what
your Mama told me?

925
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,879
She's not coming home
until you come home, too.

926
01:24:01,417 --> 01:24:04,633
You gonna have to tell
her it's all right.

927
01:24:04,987 --> 01:24:08,619
You'll have to tell her that
we're going to be together again.

928
01:24:08,620 --> 01:24:09,740
No.

929
01:24:11,097 --> 01:24:14,073
I don't want to live
with you no more.

930
01:24:14,586 --> 01:24:16,752
I told Mama she can go back.

931
01:24:17,180 --> 01:24:18,974
I told her she could.

932
01:24:19,094 --> 01:24:20,963
But I can't. I won't.

933
01:24:21,083 --> 01:24:22,483
You won't?

934
01:24:23,294 --> 01:24:25,750
You won't live
with me no more?

935
01:24:26,567 --> 01:24:28,273
You are still a child.

936
01:24:28,372 --> 01:24:30,144
You don't say what you do.

937
01:24:30,145 --> 01:24:32,691
I'm your Daddy.
I say what you do.

938
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:33,812
No.

939
01:24:41,838 --> 01:24:44,944
I want you to try to
be reasonable, girl.

940
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:48,616
I want you to
tell your Mama.

941
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:52,927
I want you to stop all this nonsense
before you make me really mad.

942
01:24:52,928 --> 01:24:56,005
I'd rather die than go
back to living with you.

943
01:24:56,006 --> 01:24:57,826
I bet you would.

944
01:24:58,205 --> 01:25:00,025
I want you to leave.

945
01:25:00,838 --> 01:25:02,658
I'm going to tell her.

946
01:25:04,908 --> 01:25:07,204
I'm gonna tell
her everything.

947
01:25:08,742 --> 01:25:11,092
You don't want to help
your daddy at all, do you?

948
01:25:11,093 --> 01:25:12,217
Do you?

949
01:25:12,337 --> 01:25:16,055
You don't want to
do anything for me!

950
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:21,047
You're the reason.

951
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:25,373
Anney loves me.

952
01:25:25,493 --> 01:25:26,730
I know it.

953
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:29,981
But you make her
ashamed, ashamed of you.

954
01:25:30,544 --> 01:25:32,665
And ashamed of loving me!

955
01:25:32,785 --> 01:25:34,311
And it ain't right!

956
01:25:38,795 --> 01:25:43,232
Anney is going to
come back to me.

957
01:25:43,600 --> 01:25:45,015
I know it.

958
01:25:45,135 --> 01:25:46,969
She just needs
a little time,

959
01:25:46,970 --> 01:25:50,566
I understand that with
everything that's happened.

960
01:25:51,017 --> 01:25:53,823
But if she wasn't
coming back to me,

961
01:25:54,184 --> 01:25:57,496
I would kill you.
You know that.

962
01:25:58,958 --> 01:26:00,784
I would break your neck.

963
01:26:14,038 --> 01:26:15,438
Damn you!

964
01:26:15,694 --> 01:26:17,060
Let me go!

965
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:18,580
Come here!

966
01:26:19,563 --> 01:26:20,778
Let me go!

967
01:26:20,898 --> 01:26:22,018
Stop!

968
01:26:26,382 --> 01:26:27,749
Where are you going?

969
01:26:27,750 --> 01:26:30,216
Where do you
think you're going?

970
01:26:31,041 --> 01:26:32,861
You're a big girl?

971
01:26:37,415 --> 01:26:41,441
You guess you're so grown
up, you tell me what to do?

972
01:26:43,181 --> 01:26:44,581
Come here.

973
01:26:45,080 --> 01:26:47,416
You're going
to say no to me?

974
01:26:48,900 --> 01:26:51,416
I'll show you
how grown you are.

975
01:26:58,651 --> 01:27:00,177
You're so grown up?

976
01:27:00,261 --> 01:27:02,597
You're going
to say no to me?

977
01:27:05,409 --> 01:27:08,565
Going to show me how
big and bad you are?

978
01:27:26,952 --> 01:27:28,772
You son of a-bitch!

979
01:27:29,189 --> 01:27:30,589
You monster!

980
01:27:32,903 --> 01:27:34,252
Come on, baby.

981
01:27:34,372 --> 01:27:35,729
You desgraçad!

982
01:27:35,849 --> 01:27:36,947
Oh, no!

983
01:27:37,067 --> 01:27:38,887
Oh no, baby. Please!

984
01:27:42,569 --> 01:27:45,803
- Baby! I just wanted to talk to her!
- Stay away!

985
01:27:45,804 --> 01:27:47,860
I don't know what happened!

986
01:27:47,954 --> 01:27:49,938
I just wanted
to talk to her.

987
01:27:49,939 --> 01:27:52,405
Please, Anney.
I didn't mean it.

988
01:27:54,189 --> 01:27:56,875
I didn't mean it.
Please don't go.

989
01:27:57,511 --> 01:27:58,911
Get out!

990
01:27:59,183 --> 01:28:01,003
I didn't mean it!

991
01:28:01,447 --> 01:28:03,508
Don't go! I can't
live without you!

992
01:28:03,509 --> 01:28:04,952
Kill me!

993
01:28:05,072 --> 01:28:07,084
Glen! Stop it!

994
01:28:07,204 --> 01:28:08,860
Please, baby, kill me!

995
01:28:11,115 --> 01:28:14,608
Oh god, help.

996
01:28:15,740 --> 01:28:16,788
Help me!

997
01:28:34,416 --> 01:28:37,111
Come on, Bone.
Tell me who it was.

998
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,750
Just tell me, sweetheart.

999
01:28:42,602 --> 01:28:46,518
No one's ever going to hurt
you again. Just tell me.

1000
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:49,945
I want my Mama.

1001
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,026
Your Mama ain't here, Bone.

1002
01:28:56,317 --> 01:28:58,833
I think you ought
to let her be.

1003
01:29:06,154 --> 01:29:07,974
You want to go home?

1004
01:29:09,443 --> 01:29:10,843
Let's go.

1005
01:29:23,387 --> 01:29:24,507
Bone,

1006
01:29:25,871 --> 01:29:28,397
I know you don't
understand this.

1007
01:29:28,887 --> 01:29:30,987
I barely understand, myself.

1008
01:29:33,424 --> 01:29:37,111
No woman should have to choose
between a baby and her lover.

1009
01:29:37,112 --> 01:29:39,648
Between her child
and her husband.

1010
01:29:41,628 --> 01:29:45,674
We all do terrible things
to the ones we love sometimes

1011
01:29:45,971 --> 01:29:47,437
and it eats us up,

1012
01:29:48,887 --> 01:29:51,433
but we do them,
just the same.

1013
01:29:54,148 --> 01:29:57,194
You want to know
about your Mom, I know.

1014
01:30:00,179 --> 01:30:02,345
I can't explain that to you.

1015
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:04,960
I can't.

1016
01:30:08,907 --> 01:30:11,303
I don't know
where she's gone.

1017
01:30:11,587 --> 01:30:12,813
None of us do,

1018
01:30:14,399 --> 01:30:16,499
but I know she loves you.

1019
01:30:17,024 --> 01:30:18,844
Don't doubt that.

1020
01:30:19,610 --> 01:30:22,086
And she'll never
forgive herself.

1021
01:30:23,994 --> 01:30:25,046
I hate her.

1022
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:26,986
You'll forgive her.

1023
01:30:27,757 --> 01:30:29,009
I hate her.

1024
01:31:14,914 --> 01:31:16,314
Hey, Anney.

1025
01:31:17,671 --> 01:31:19,071
Hey, Earle.

1026
01:31:24,593 --> 01:31:26,413
I'm OK, Uncle Earle.

1027
01:31:50,685 --> 01:31:53,919
Bone, I never wanted
you to get hurt.

1028
01:31:55,522 --> 01:31:58,798
I never thought it
would go the way it did.

1029
01:31:59,866 --> 01:32:01,686
I never thought

1030
01:32:02,915 --> 01:32:05,715
Glen would hurt
you like that.

1031
01:32:08,001 --> 01:32:09,987
And I just loved him.

1032
01:32:12,073 --> 01:32:13,473
You know that?

1033
01:32:14,153 --> 01:32:16,863
I just loved him so much.

1034
01:32:17,723 --> 01:32:19,889
I couldn't see him that way.

1035
01:32:22,945 --> 01:32:25,187
I couldn't believe.

1036
01:32:27,305 --> 01:32:29,125
I couldn't imagine.

1037
01:32:33,293 --> 01:32:36,509
You don't know how
much I love you, honey.

1038
01:32:36,902 --> 01:32:39,308
How much I've
always loved you.

1039
01:32:40,550 --> 01:32:41,670
Mama.

1040
01:33:26,669 --> 01:33:28,489
I love you, Bone.

1041
01:33:31,177 --> 01:33:32,997
You're my best girl.

1042
01:33:34,668 --> 01:33:36,068
I love you.

1043
01:34:14,584 --> 01:34:16,404
Who had Mama been?

1044
01:34:17,068 --> 01:34:21,364
What had she wanted to be
or do before I was born?

1045
01:34:22,328 --> 01:34:24,734
Once I was born,
her hopes turned

1046
01:34:24,735 --> 01:34:29,241
and I climbed up her life like
a flower reaching for the sun.

1047
01:34:29,680 --> 01:34:31,976
Her life had
folded into mine.

1048
01:34:33,662 --> 01:34:38,890
Who would I be when
I was 15, 20, 30?

1049
01:34:39,538 --> 01:34:42,404
Would I be as strong
as she had been?

1050
01:34:42,524 --> 01:34:47,266
As hungry for love, as
desperate, determined and ashamed?

1051
01:34:47,829 --> 01:34:49,335
I wouldn't know,

1052
01:34:49,632 --> 01:34:52,670
but I was already
who I was going to be,

1053
01:34:52,671 --> 01:34:54,210
someone like her,

1054
01:34:54,651 --> 01:34:59,181
like my Mama, a
Boatwright, a desgraçad.

1055
01:34:59,783 --> 01:35:01,883
A desgraçad out of Carolina.

1056
01:35:03,146 --> 01:35:04,880
I love you, mama.
