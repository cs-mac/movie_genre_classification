1
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:14,636
<i>The island of Cape Breton,
the northeastern end of Nova Scotia...</i>

2
00:01:14,744 --> 00:01:18,078
<i>is just a small chunk of land
sticking out into the Atlantic.</i>

3
00:01:18,147 --> 00:01:20,412
<i>Roads haven't been built through
everywhere yet.</i>

4
00:01:20,483 --> 00:01:22,850
<i>You mostly have to come in from the sea.</i>

5
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:26,081
<i>It needs an old hand to navigate
through the shoals offshore...</i>

6
00:01:26,155 --> 00:01:29,853
<i>especially during the storms that come up
suddenly in the summertime...</i>

7
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:32,793
<i>and the little lighthouse
has saved many a life.</i>

8
00:01:32,862 --> 00:01:34,854
<i>The village isn't much to shout about.</i>

9
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:38,423
<i>Just a quiet, peaceful place where
the people are proud of their church...</i>

10
00:01:38,501 --> 00:01:42,438
<i>built with their own hands and what
little money they could scrape up.</i>

11
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:44,303
<i>Their farms don't bring in much...</i>

12
00:01:44,373 --> 00:01:46,865
<i>but for a few months each year
when the cod are running...</i>

13
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,501
<i>there's a lot of excitement.</i>

14
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:51,706
<i>You should see the harbor then,
alive with boats.</i>

15
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:54,807
<i>They leave the women to take care
of the potatoes and livestock...</i>

16
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:56,477
<i>and put out to sea.</i>

17
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:59,181
<i>Not many of them are lucky enough
to have their own boat...</i>

18
00:01:59,288 --> 00:02:02,690
<i>but they all get a share
when the catch is paid for at the cannery.</i>

19
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:06,854
<i>A fair-sized haul means everything.
It means food for the long winter...</i>

20
00:02:06,963 --> 00:02:09,865
<i>new blades for tools,
grain bought for cattle.</i>

21
00:02:09,966 --> 00:02:12,401
<i>That's why we watch each vessel
as she comes in...</i>

22
00:02:12,502 --> 00:02:14,403
<i>to see how low she sets in the water.</i>

23
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:18,464
Floyd, come on back here
and give us a hand with these fish.

24
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:22,376
Fergus, tack in on that line.
Help get this catch ashore.

25
00:02:23,012 --> 00:02:25,481
Get that unloading net aboard.

26
00:02:25,548 --> 00:02:28,541
- How many drags did you make?
- Two, three hours.

27
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,816
Take it away.

28
00:02:46,035 --> 00:02:47,833
Get that boom over.

29
00:02:52,775 --> 00:02:54,710
Don't tie it off, get it back onboard.

30
00:02:54,777 --> 00:02:57,679
I don't want to hang around all day
on this reeking wharf.

31
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,513
- Look out!
- Hook's in his shoulder.

32
00:03:02,018 --> 00:03:04,010
Hey, Dan'l!

33
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:06,180
- Do you know where the doctor is?
- Sure, he's dead.

34
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:10,283
No, the new doctor. Same place. Get.
Hurry up, bring him back, quick.

35
00:03:10,393 --> 00:03:14,057
Come on, get going before this load
starts stinking the place up.

36
00:03:26,142 --> 00:03:27,235
Yes?

37
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,939
I got to get the doctor.
Tim's been hurt down at the boat.

38
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,309
What is it, Stella?

39
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:35,044
There's a boy out here says a man's
been hurt down at the wharf.

40
00:03:35,117 --> 00:03:36,415
I'll be right there.

41
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,130
Will you be giving me
some medicine, doctor?

42
00:03:38,154 --> 00:03:39,986
No, Mrs. Poggety, just this diet list.

43
00:03:40,089 --> 00:03:41,767
I think you'd better
have your teeth X-rayed.

44
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,317
- Oh, but Dr. Peterson always said--
- I'm not Dr. Peterson.

45
00:03:44,427 --> 00:03:46,328
But what do my teeth to do
with my backache?

46
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:49,593
Well, it's taken medicine a good
many years to define that connection...

47
00:03:49,665 --> 00:03:52,897
and I haven't time, unfortunately,
right now to explain it all to you.

48
00:03:52,969 --> 00:03:54,995
Stella will take care of your things.

49
00:03:55,104 --> 00:03:57,664
- Will you be back to supper?
- I don't know.

50
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:10,645
- When can I go back to work?
- No time at all.

51
00:04:10,753 --> 00:04:13,848
The main thing is to see
there's no infection.

52
00:04:14,357 --> 00:04:16,417
Would you like to put his coat on?

53
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,626
I'll take him in the buggy.

54
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,313
Hello, darling.

55
00:04:39,382 --> 00:04:41,681
Hey, Locky. Going to the dance Saturday?

56
00:04:41,784 --> 00:04:45,812
- Why? Your Gus going out with the fleet?
- I'll be on the wharf tonight.

57
00:04:45,888 --> 00:04:48,050
Well, don't catch cold.

58
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:50,783
- So long, girls.
- Bye, Locky.

59
00:04:56,365 --> 00:04:58,334
I looked for you, McCormick.

60
00:04:58,401 --> 00:05:01,667
One half the fish you land yesterday
are undersize like little sardines.

61
00:05:01,737 --> 00:05:05,367
Well, at 14 cents a pound I can't be
bothered sorting them. I'd starve to death.

62
00:05:05,474 --> 00:05:07,514
If the buyer see them
he will not take them from me.

63
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,875
Well, boost your price
and I'll toss back the little ones.

64
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,290
And while we're talking about it...

65
00:05:11,314 --> 00:05:13,215
- you miserable old skinflint....
- What's that?

66
00:05:13,316 --> 00:05:14,993
Don't get your hackles up,
you Micmac Indian...

67
00:05:15,017 --> 00:05:16,246
not with that tub of guts.

68
00:05:16,352 --> 00:05:18,583
- Micmac?
- Micmac! You'd not last two rounds.

69
00:05:18,688 --> 00:05:20,884
It's about time
somebody took you down a peg.

70
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,549
You sell our catch for fancy prices...

71
00:05:22,658 --> 00:05:25,218
yet you knock down 12 cents the pound
on us farmers.

72
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:26,728
You do not like that?

73
00:05:26,829 --> 00:05:29,264
Well now, you listen to me,
Mr. Locky McCormick...

74
00:05:29,365 --> 00:05:32,096
you owe big bill in my store.
You know that.

75
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:34,102
Well, you pay or I take your stinky boat.

76
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,570
Why, you greasy old half-breed.

77
00:05:36,672 --> 00:05:40,109
You try and take that boat
and I'll gut you out like a cod.

78
00:06:05,401 --> 00:06:06,892
You keep your hands to yourself.

79
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:10,201
Pretty tony since you're working
for His Lordship, huh?

80
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,707
You mind your own business.
I've got to get supper ready.

81
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:15,040
I don't like to see you
working for this man, Stella.

82
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:17,637
He's a fine doctor. He's a....

83
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:22,078
Anyway he's something big.
Something even you can't pronounce.

84
00:06:22,151 --> 00:06:24,052
Probably something not fit to mention.

85
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,385
What're you working your head off for,
anyhow?

86
00:06:26,455 --> 00:06:28,495
What good's a dead uncle
if you don't use his money?

87
00:06:28,557 --> 00:06:29,718
No hurry.

88
00:06:29,792 --> 00:06:33,058
Plenty can happen between now
and the time the deeds will be signed.

89
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:37,567
You going to try to run it yourself?
That's a good farm, needs a man.

90
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,893
- We could make a lot out of that place.
- We?

91
00:06:39,969 --> 00:06:43,838
Sure, I've been thinking things over.
You and me make a great pair.

92
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,908
We ought to get married,
the sooner, the better.

93
00:06:45,975 --> 00:06:48,911
Well, this is a surprise,
Mr. Locky McCormick.

94
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:51,607
Blow your nose, don't look so silly.

95
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:53,238
Oh, Stella...

96
00:06:53,449 --> 00:06:56,180
what dress you wearing
to the dance Saturday? The one I like?

97
00:06:56,285 --> 00:06:57,583
Maybe.

98
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,085
- You're taking me then?
- Well, of course I am.

99
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:03,092
Fergus put in for it first.
We practiced a step for the jig contest.

100
00:07:03,159 --> 00:07:04,286
I'm taking you.

101
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,626
He and Floyd can toss a coin to see
who dances with you, but I'm taking you.

102
00:07:07,696 --> 00:07:09,688
The doctor's coming.
You'd better get out of here.

103
00:07:09,799 --> 00:07:11,427
He's in my way.

104
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:15,330
- You're coming down to the wharf later?
- Might.

105
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,007
Thank you.

106
00:07:59,849 --> 00:08:01,909
- Is the doctor in?
- He's eating his supper.

107
00:08:02,017 --> 00:08:04,213
I've got to see him. She's awful bad.

108
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,298
I'll tell him as soon as he's finished
but I can't--

109
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,654
Stella?

110
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:12,426
- What is it?
- It's only Aggie MacDonald from the mill.

111
00:08:12,495 --> 00:08:13,839
Nobody has anything to do with them...

112
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:15,832
and it's never a penny of pay
you'll get from her.

113
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:18,697
Well, she said someone was sick,
didn't she?

114
00:08:18,767 --> 00:08:22,101
I didn't like bothering you,
but she's having so much trouble.

115
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:25,402
- The pain's that strong.
- I'll get my bag.

116
00:08:25,508 --> 00:08:30,037
He didn't come at night last time.
It's 12 miles to the veterinary.

117
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,412
It's our cow,
she's the only good one we've got.

118
00:08:35,784 --> 00:08:37,514
We'll fix her up.

119
00:09:08,751 --> 00:09:11,243
He wouldn't have wanted me
to call you, Black wouldn't.

120
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,948
He'll say it costs money...

121
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:16,583
but if the critter dies,
then it's me who's to blame.

122
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,753
I'll do all I can to help.

123
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,399
In there.

124
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:43,077
Would you hold the light
a little higher, please?

125
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,464
She can't hear you. She's deaf, dumb.

126
00:09:57,766 --> 00:09:59,257
That's too bad.

127
00:10:00,336 --> 00:10:02,999
What she don't know don't hurt her none.

128
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:33,068
- By the way, it's a girl.
- Aye.

129
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:36,361
- Thanks for coming.
- Glad to help.

130
00:10:55,524 --> 00:10:57,356
- Was she born deaf?
- No...

131
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:00,225
she took sick
when she was about a year old.

132
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:02,491
Come time to talk, no sound come out.

133
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:05,257
She growed up that way, dumb.

134
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,028
Blessing she has
such a fine father and mother.

135
00:11:08,103 --> 00:11:10,038
That ain't her mother.

136
00:11:10,339 --> 00:11:14,606
It's my sister, Aggie.
Her mother's dead. She killed her.

137
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:18,846
She died in childbed.

138
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:22,612
I guess sometimes it's meant to be.

139
00:11:22,718 --> 00:11:24,949
Sometimes it's easier
to lose someone that way...

140
00:11:25,054 --> 00:11:27,250
than to lose them when they're still alive.

141
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,351
I was in love with a girl.
She married another man.

142
00:11:31,427 --> 00:11:34,864
I was wondering. A young chap like you,
burying himself here.

143
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,195
The other doctors was always old.

144
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:40,065
That was part of it.
There were lots of other things.

145
00:11:40,135 --> 00:11:41,899
It's a pretty stale story.

146
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:44,872
Way things were going,
I sort of got fed up.

147
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:50,074
So I decided to look for another way.
Simple life, simple things.

148
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:53,138
If people would only learn
to let each other live...

149
00:11:53,248 --> 00:11:56,309
it would be a different world.
What's the fee?

150
00:11:57,453 --> 00:12:00,787
I wouldn't know.
I never delivered a heifer before.

151
00:12:02,124 --> 00:12:05,390
I might take it out
in fishing in that pool of yours.

152
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,726
Looks like a wonderful place for trout.

153
00:12:07,796 --> 00:12:10,095
- You're welcome anytime.
- Thanks.

154
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:36,516
Good morning, Stella.

155
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:39,254
I was early so I stopped in
to tidy up a bit. The dishes....

156
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:40,921
Please don't bother.

157
00:12:40,996 --> 00:12:43,363
- Are you going out?
- For a little while.

158
00:12:43,465 --> 00:12:44,990
That's a nice dress. New, isn't it?

159
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,695
- I made it myself. I make all my own--
- Very pretty.

160
00:12:47,803 --> 00:12:49,803
I'll see you tomorrow.
We may have fish for dinner.

161
00:12:49,838 --> 00:12:51,683
I like fish.
I've got the most wonderful way of--

162
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:53,266
No guarantees.

163
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:21,562
Look, Mrs. Lutz, the new doctor.

164
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:24,162
He hasn't been to church once
in three whole months.

165
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:25,707
Nice example.

166
00:13:25,874 --> 00:13:28,867
He's a fine doctor. What he did for my Tim.

167
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:32,512
She's always talking about,
"He's a fine doctor..."

168
00:13:32,581 --> 00:13:35,244
just because he put a bandage on a cut.

169
00:14:36,812 --> 00:14:38,075
Hello?

170
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:19,614
Here, let me help you. Hello.

171
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:23,648
Now, where do they go?

172
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,181
Oh, the chickens.

173
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,304
Don't be afraid.

174
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,747
You watch me talk.

175
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:03,755
That is a...

176
00:17:04,893 --> 00:17:06,327
rooster.

177
00:17:11,266 --> 00:17:13,599
And these are...

178
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,833
hens.

179
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:29,918
Very good.

180
00:17:36,024 --> 00:17:38,789
That's a tree.

181
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,095
Tree.

182
00:17:50,272 --> 00:17:51,399
Yes.

183
00:17:56,878 --> 00:17:58,073
Water.

184
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:11,718
Very good. Now if you give...

185
00:18:12,327 --> 00:18:15,229
water to the tree...

186
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,460
it will grow.

187
00:18:23,839 --> 00:18:27,833
Water to the tree, it will grow.

188
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,481
Yes, it will grow. The tree will grow.

189
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:41,283
It has very big roots. The roots go...

190
00:18:42,424 --> 00:18:44,256
deep into the earth.

191
00:18:46,461 --> 00:18:47,485
Earth.

192
00:18:56,538 --> 00:18:58,507
And all of it together...

193
00:19:02,811 --> 00:19:04,177
is land.

194
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,945
Land.

195
00:19:18,226 --> 00:19:20,058
Good. Earth.

196
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,148
Eggs.

197
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:54,053
Four of them. Four.

198
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:04,663
No. One, two, three, four.

199
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:06,335
Four.

200
00:20:12,681 --> 00:20:16,118
You're right. You're learning very fast.

201
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,785
Pretty soon you and I will be able to talk.

202
00:20:23,258 --> 00:20:24,954
Talk. Right.

203
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,735
What're you trying to do, McCormick,
shake the clapper out of the bell?

204
00:20:42,811 --> 00:20:44,871
- Where's my flour, Mac?
- Ain't it ready?

205
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:46,073
I can't see it.

206
00:20:46,147 --> 00:20:48,412
The Dummy should be here to serve you.

207
00:20:59,928 --> 00:21:01,658
She ain't done it.

208
00:21:01,997 --> 00:21:04,933
I put it down for her.
You'll have to come back tomorrow.

209
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,300
Where can I get a team weekdays?
I'll have to wait till Saturday.

210
00:21:08,403 --> 00:21:10,481
But if it ain't done then,
I'm going somewheres else.

211
00:21:10,505 --> 00:21:13,236
It'll be ready. I'll make her remember.

212
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:16,569
How can you expect a dimwit
to use her head?

213
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,589
What's all this? What is it?

214
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,786
Water, ocean.

215
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:34,456
Ocean.

216
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:41,694
What's got into you?
I write it all down for you.

217
00:21:41,803 --> 00:21:44,932
Here, it's as plain as the nose
on your face.

218
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,808
Oh. Well, I guess I forgot.

219
00:21:52,047 --> 00:21:53,310
Look.

220
00:21:59,287 --> 00:22:02,553
Well, I was wondering.
She never makes a mistake.

221
00:22:04,292 --> 00:22:06,193
Did you ever think
of sending her to school?

222
00:22:06,294 --> 00:22:07,455
School?

223
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:10,624
She's deaf and dumb, man.
There's no teaching her nothing.

224
00:22:10,699 --> 00:22:15,364
Here's the extent of her learning.
I make a sign at the top of each page.

225
00:22:15,804 --> 00:22:18,672
A cross for Pacquet,
a circle for McCormick...

226
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,209
two lines for the McQuiggens and so on.

227
00:22:21,309 --> 00:22:23,141
A mark for each bag.

228
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:27,312
I put them down when they come in,
she strikes them off when they're ready.

229
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:30,417
She's learned to identify every man
by his mark.

230
00:22:30,852 --> 00:22:34,345
Must be over 40 names in this book
and she knows every one of them.

231
00:22:34,422 --> 00:22:38,689
So that shows, Mr. MacDonald,
that your daughter is an intelligent girl.

232
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,229
Now, there's a special school
for the deaf at McGill.

233
00:22:41,329 --> 00:22:43,161
Schools cost money...

234
00:22:43,264 --> 00:22:46,428
and money don't grow on trees
in this country.

235
00:22:47,002 --> 00:22:50,598
We're lucky to keep body
and soul together, we farmers.

236
00:22:51,339 --> 00:22:53,604
I couldn't spare her. Thanks.

237
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:56,574
There's work enough around here as it is.

238
00:22:56,678 --> 00:23:00,445
But she could be taught, I'm sure of it.
What's her name?

239
00:23:01,282 --> 00:23:03,615
Me wife wanted her named after herself...

240
00:23:03,918 --> 00:23:06,513
Belinda. Belinda MacDonald.

241
00:23:06,788 --> 00:23:09,223
But they call her the Dummy around here.

242
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:11,454
They shouldn't.

243
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:15,121
Even though she can't hear,
these people have very keen perceptions.

244
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,425
- Aye.
- They notice things.

245
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:19,467
Come to think of it, she's fond of colors.

246
00:23:20,535 --> 00:23:24,302
I took her to church once years ago.
They played the organ.

247
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:27,865
A look come over her face
as though she heard.

248
00:23:27,942 --> 00:23:30,707
I knew all the time
she couldn't hear a thing.

249
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,113
Well, I'm losing time.
I must get on with my work.

250
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:36,380
Good day to you.

251
00:23:36,451 --> 00:23:38,443
Would you mind if I talked to her
once in a while?

252
00:23:38,553 --> 00:23:39,748
Talk?

253
00:23:39,821 --> 00:23:43,986
When I was an intern at the hospital
I worked for a while with deaf children.

254
00:23:44,092 --> 00:23:47,426
Why, I might even have one of the books
still kicking around somewhere.

255
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:49,555
I'd like to try
to teach her some lip-reading.

256
00:23:49,631 --> 00:23:52,100
You'll be wasting your while, man.

257
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,767
But you're welcome here anytime.

258
00:24:29,804 --> 00:24:33,104
- $1.80, Mrs. Lutz.
- Did you get the oilcloth?

259
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:36,167
No, but I will save it for you
when it comes in. Thank you.

260
00:24:36,277 --> 00:24:37,540
Bye.

261
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:40,774
There's the doctor again.

262
00:24:41,149 --> 00:24:42,981
Talking to himself.

263
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:49,119
- It's spooky.
- I think he's queer in the head.

264
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,718
Pretty smart
when it comes to making out his bills.

265
00:25:00,168 --> 00:25:03,138
Hello. Happen to know what kind
of tobacco Black MacDonald uses?

266
00:25:03,204 --> 00:25:05,173
MacDonald has not bought here in weeks.

267
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:10,042
Dr. Richardson, I receive your bill.
Rather steep for a stomachache, yes?

268
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:13,744
As far as I remember, it was three calls.
Two of them after midnight.

269
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:17,751
Dr. Peterson always took his fees out
in barter, like everyone else.

270
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:19,844
Mr. Pacquet,
I have to get cash somewhere.

271
00:25:19,921 --> 00:25:22,720
You and a few others
are the only ones who can afford it.

272
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:26,192
You wouldn't have to pay me any bills
if you'd stick to that diet I gave you.

273
00:25:26,261 --> 00:25:29,493
The only trouble with you is
you eat too well.

274
00:25:29,564 --> 00:25:32,659
Now, I'll have this. See, 15, isn't it?

275
00:25:33,434 --> 00:25:37,201
Or would you rather wait
and have me take out a splinter?

276
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,232
Get your filthy bug out of my dough.

277
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:18,041
The spuds is covered with them.
I can't pick everyone off single-handed.

278
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:22,208
And milk, and plow,
and blast stones without any help.

279
00:26:22,283 --> 00:26:25,776
- Don't blame me.
- I'm not blaming you, I'm only telling you.

280
00:26:25,887 --> 00:26:27,981
I suppose you want me to pull the plow.

281
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:32,322
I suppose I'm not doing my share, cooking,
and mending, and baking, and spinning.

282
00:26:32,427 --> 00:26:34,953
- Who helps me?
- You got the Dummy.

283
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:37,055
A fine lot of help, that one.

284
00:26:37,131 --> 00:26:41,227
All the grand ideas that doctor
has been putting into her head.

285
00:26:41,302 --> 00:26:43,794
Filling her up with fancy notions.

286
00:26:45,006 --> 00:26:48,238
You know what she was doing
instead of feeding the hogs?

287
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,107
Brushing her hair.

288
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,079
That's not fair to me.
I'm doing the work of six.

289
00:26:54,148 --> 00:26:58,244
What's this I hear about you
loafing all day? There's work to do.

290
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:15,828
Aggie, did you see that?
She knew what I was saying.

291
00:27:15,937 --> 00:27:17,132
Oh, tosh.

292
00:27:17,205 --> 00:27:20,266
She can hear. Belinda, come here!

293
00:27:22,277 --> 00:27:25,679
- I tell you she understands, woman.
- You're wandering in your head.

294
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:29,984
- But she came when I called her.
- She was reading your lips.

295
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:32,550
She's been a very good pupil.

296
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:37,625
Belinda, how do you say hello to a friend?

297
00:27:39,627 --> 00:27:41,118
That's right.

298
00:27:41,629 --> 00:27:45,122
"I am happy to see you."

299
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,366
And I'm happy to see you.

300
00:27:47,468 --> 00:27:50,302
- Telling me she can talk that way?
- Of course.

301
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:53,307
We've been studying
from a book of signs...

302
00:27:53,374 --> 00:27:56,469
which were devised by a Frenchman
a couple of hundred years ago...

303
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,911
the Abbe de L'Epee,
he was a priest.

304
00:27:59,013 --> 00:28:03,075
See, each word has its own sign.
For instance, there's "man."

305
00:28:03,351 --> 00:28:06,219
The sign is this: touching the hat brim.

306
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:10,224
- And what would "woman" be?
- This. Comes from a bonnet string.

307
00:28:11,326 --> 00:28:15,320
And that's "mother."
Baby. You see, woman with a child.

308
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:18,264
It's beyond believing.
It's as clear as day.

309
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,696
And that is the sign for "day."

310
00:28:20,768 --> 00:28:25,001
You see, this represents the horizon and
this is the sun coming up over the horizon.

311
00:28:25,073 --> 00:28:27,872
This is noon
with the sun directly overhead.

312
00:28:27,942 --> 00:28:32,710
Afternoon, evening, and night
when the sun has disappeared completely.

313
00:28:33,214 --> 00:28:34,682
Good morning.

314
00:28:35,516 --> 00:28:36,779
Good night.

315
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,116
And that's "bread."

316
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:50,262
What is it? It's a butterfly. Sure.

317
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,597
It is a butterfly. It flutters.

318
00:28:56,371 --> 00:28:57,566
Aggie!

319
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:00,235
Aggie, come here.

320
00:29:00,308 --> 00:29:01,606
- I got something.
- What?

321
00:29:01,709 --> 00:29:04,941
Look sharp now. Think fast.
What does this mean?

322
00:29:05,113 --> 00:29:08,572
- It means you've gone loony.
- It's a butterfly. Look.

323
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:11,244
Don't go waving your hands at me,
I'm not the Dummy.

324
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:14,289
And if you want to have any bread to eat
while I'm gone, leave me be.

325
00:29:14,389 --> 00:29:16,415
It's a good job you're going.

326
00:29:16,491 --> 00:29:19,051
We'll have peace around here
for a couple of days.

327
00:29:20,094 --> 00:29:21,824
It's like a miracle.

328
00:29:31,506 --> 00:29:34,601
- Would she be saying "father"?
- Yes, she did.

329
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:37,642
It's the first time
she ever called me that.

330
00:29:39,247 --> 00:29:42,149
Daughter, my daughter.

331
00:29:47,588 --> 00:29:48,588
What do they want?

332
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:09,110
What's going on here, McCormick?

333
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:11,669
Where's my flour?
McQuiggens wants theirs, too.

334
00:30:11,779 --> 00:30:12,803
It's all done.

335
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,349
We'd better load it
before we get too dizzy from dancing.

336
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,352
It's there on the racks.
Load it and get out.

337
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:20,786
Here it is, boys. Get to it!

338
00:30:24,225 --> 00:30:25,989
All these are mine.
Put them on the bottom.

339
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,494
Yes, Lock.

340
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:32,065
- Afraid you'll crack a fingernail?
- Flour don't go good on my suit.

341
00:30:34,135 --> 00:30:38,072
This floor's slick as a whistle.
Hey, Hector, come on. Give us a tune.

342
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:32,387
Hi, Stella, you're looking very handsome.

343
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,055
You like to dance.
Why don't you come with us?

344
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:38,122
- Yes.
- It'll be fun. Basket supper.

345
00:31:40,368 --> 00:31:43,600
I'd love to. Unfortunately,
I have a previous engagement.

346
00:31:43,704 --> 00:31:46,264
Two measles cases five miles apart.

347
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:49,929
Hey, the Dummy's dancing.

348
00:32:53,975 --> 00:32:57,503
- Her name's Belinda.
- She looks kind of cute fixed up that way.

349
00:33:14,962 --> 00:33:16,692
You keep away from that Dummy.

350
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:19,062
Keep away.... The Dummy and me?

351
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:20,566
I saw you taking in her legs.

352
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:24,036
Jealous of a dimwit.
I'm plum ashamed of you, woman!

353
00:33:29,977 --> 00:33:32,208
One thing, she'd never tell on you.

354
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,315
- But keep away from her or I'll be able--
- Well, I guess that's all.

355
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:38,075
What are we waiting for?

356
00:33:58,105 --> 00:34:00,438
I want some cider. Come on, hurry up.

357
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:02,236
Locky!

358
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:12,181
- What's the damage, Mac?
- You know what it is.

359
00:34:16,023 --> 00:34:17,389
Locky, come on.

360
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:23,897
Everybody, sing. Everybody, sing now.

361
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:38,008
Didn't have time to finish them.
I can't do 10 things at once.

362
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,344
It's not my fault if my sister got sick.

363
00:34:40,614 --> 00:34:44,051
Well, I'll only be gone a few days.
You can manage.

364
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,882
- Aggie!
- I'm coming.

365
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:49,753
Well, goodbye, Belinda.

366
00:34:52,226 --> 00:34:55,390
Sometimes a body'd almost think
you understood.

367
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:22,119
You'll miss the train.

368
00:35:23,557 --> 00:35:25,992
Besides, I don't want to leave Belinda
alone too long.

369
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:28,585
Nobody would bother stealing her.

370
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,180
There's Mrs. Johnny John-John
just back from hospital.

371
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:58,817
She looks right spry for a woman
who's just had her arteries cut out.

372
00:35:58,926 --> 00:36:01,157
Not her arteries, Mrs. Lutz.

373
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,664
Get off my feet. You're drunk.

374
00:36:21,282 --> 00:36:23,274
Mrs. Moore is her own worst enemy.

375
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:25,615
Not while I'm alive, she isn't.

376
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,076
Hello, Dummy.

377
00:38:00,748 --> 00:38:02,478
Look what I brought you.

378
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:05,317
Want to dance?

379
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:35,014
First time a man kissed you, wasn't it?

380
00:38:42,423 --> 00:38:45,359
Don't be scared, Dummy.
Your heart's pounding.

381
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:49,824
I caught a sea gull once,
it had the same scared look.

382
00:39:46,253 --> 00:39:47,721
Hello, Mac.

383
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:53,319
Glad you're here. You've been missed.

384
00:39:53,394 --> 00:39:55,590
Well, I'm sorry. I was busy with my call.

385
00:39:55,696 --> 00:39:58,393
I've been worried about the girl.
There's something wrong.

386
00:39:58,499 --> 00:40:00,900
- Why?
- You can see for yourself.

387
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,567
All right.

388
00:40:09,877 --> 00:40:11,743
Hello, Aggie. You get back all right?

389
00:40:11,845 --> 00:40:13,837
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't, would I?

390
00:40:13,914 --> 00:40:16,110
- Is your sister better?
- Yes.

391
00:40:16,617 --> 00:40:20,611
- Did she have a good doctor?
- Didn't have any. Doesn't believe in them.

392
00:40:20,888 --> 00:40:24,052
Well, that's the right attitude
as long as one can afford it.

393
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:25,683
How's Belinda?

394
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,087
Getting peevisher by the day.

395
00:40:28,195 --> 00:40:31,029
- Where is she?
- Around here somewhere.

396
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,755
Belinda. How are you?

397
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:12,231
Are you cross with me
for not coming to see you?

398
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:17,140
Well, you see, I couldn't.

399
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:24,244
Many men and women
suddenly decided to be sick...

400
00:41:24,585 --> 00:41:26,315
at the same time.

401
00:41:30,858 --> 00:41:34,590
Would you like to study your lesson now?

402
00:41:37,598 --> 00:41:39,464
All right, no lesson.

403
00:41:47,508 --> 00:41:49,943
Belinda, if you could only hear me.

404
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:53,643
You think I don't know what it means
being lonely like you are?

405
00:41:53,714 --> 00:41:56,707
I've been lonely myself,
even when I was a child.

406
00:41:56,984 --> 00:41:59,385
Already then I wanted to be a doctor.

407
00:41:59,486 --> 00:42:03,548
I thought that helping others
might help me. It did somehow.

408
00:42:05,058 --> 00:42:09,689
Then all those other things happened.
The war and all that came after.

409
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:13,359
Made me lose faith in everything.

410
00:42:14,635 --> 00:42:16,194
In myself, too.

411
00:42:20,674 --> 00:42:21,869
Belinda.

412
00:42:23,177 --> 00:42:26,841
Belinda, you must help me.

413
00:42:27,214 --> 00:42:29,080
I need you.

414
00:42:35,355 --> 00:42:38,655
Yes. I need you.

415
00:42:39,893 --> 00:42:43,694
If you only knew what it meant
seeing you smile for the first time.

416
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:48,392
Bringing happiness, if it's only
to one single human being, is....

417
00:42:49,269 --> 00:42:52,398
Belinda, don't let me think
I've failed again.

418
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,279
You'll help me.

419
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:07,781
Mac. Mac, come here.

420
00:43:07,888 --> 00:43:11,290
Mac, Belinda's great trouble
is nothing more than loneliness.

421
00:43:11,391 --> 00:43:13,360
And she's got to have a chance.

422
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:15,555
Now, there's a doctor in Stepney,
I met him at McGill.

423
00:43:15,629 --> 00:43:16,892
A brilliant diagnostician.

424
00:43:16,964 --> 00:43:18,728
I don't know exactly what good
it would do...

425
00:43:18,799 --> 00:43:22,099
but I'd like to take Belinda to him.
Belinda...

426
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,907
how would you like to go with me
to see a town?

427
00:43:27,574 --> 00:43:29,566
T-O-W-N.

428
00:43:30,077 --> 00:43:31,443
A big town.

429
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:46,592
You've done such wonders
with her yourself.

430
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,260
Why does she have to go see that fellow?

431
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:51,493
Because, Mac, I don't know enough
and I think he does.

432
00:43:51,732 --> 00:43:53,257
Doctor like that costs money.

433
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:56,428
Don't worry about that. I'm going to write
and ask him for an interview.

434
00:43:56,503 --> 00:43:58,165
I'm sure he'll do it.

435
00:43:58,905 --> 00:44:00,931
I'm going to write him tonight.

436
00:44:33,507 --> 00:44:35,840
No, Belinda, not women. Men.

437
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,118
Do you see any hope, Doctor?

438
00:47:38,191 --> 00:47:41,218
Aye, that's why we keep on practicing,
Robert.

439
00:47:42,395 --> 00:47:45,559
I understand your concern,
but she needn't worry.

440
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:48,362
The one fact I'm sure of
is there's no otosclerosis...

441
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:51,302
so as you know, it can't be hereditary.

442
00:47:52,038 --> 00:47:55,304
There's no possibility the expected child
could inherit it.

443
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:58,709
Clinically, the birth of the child
could make all the difference...

444
00:47:58,812 --> 00:48:00,678
if my theory is correct.

445
00:48:01,314 --> 00:48:03,579
I cannot say for certain, nobody can.

446
00:48:04,518 --> 00:48:07,044
But what you've accomplished
is remarkable.

447
00:48:07,153 --> 00:48:10,385
I'd hardly say that.
I just tried a few things I knew.

448
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,891
You've always been an idealist
from way back.

449
00:48:12,993 --> 00:48:15,588
Yeah, that's what makes good doctors,
Robert.

450
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:17,828
Keep in communication with me.

451
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:19,890
I'll be interested in following
the case with you.

452
00:48:20,066 --> 00:48:22,592
- I'd be very grateful.
- Goodbye, lad.

453
00:48:51,097 --> 00:48:54,124
Dr. Gray said it wasn't possible
to determine her condition...

454
00:48:54,234 --> 00:48:56,032
after only one examination.

455
00:48:56,102 --> 00:48:58,435
He said she was very healthy,
very intelligent.

456
00:48:58,538 --> 00:48:59,949
And that he wanted to see her again.

457
00:48:59,973 --> 00:49:02,442
Fine. Now maybe she'll have a chance.

458
00:49:02,976 --> 00:49:05,969
She's worn out.
She slept nearly the whole way home.

459
00:49:06,479 --> 00:49:10,246
Belinda, why don't you go upstairs to bed?

460
00:49:18,959 --> 00:49:20,484
Good night, daughter.

461
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,803
She looks so grand in that dress.

462
00:49:41,982 --> 00:49:44,508
Beats me why I never noticed it before.

463
00:49:47,921 --> 00:49:50,948
Do you think I could take her to church
come Sunday?

464
00:49:52,125 --> 00:49:54,856
She's only been there the once,
when she was a child.

465
00:49:54,961 --> 00:49:56,520
Of course, why not?

466
00:49:56,663 --> 00:49:59,497
Right now, how about taking the cows
to the barn?

467
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:01,534
I'm forgetting everything.

468
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:09,632
You're not very fond of Belinda, are you?

469
00:50:10,777 --> 00:50:13,042
I've always been civil to her.

470
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:15,343
She's my brother's daughter.

471
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:18,816
You should see to it that she doesn't
have to carry those heavy sacks.

472
00:50:18,885 --> 00:50:20,478
She's not too strong.

473
00:50:21,621 --> 00:50:24,386
Doctor, you'll be doing
my brother and me a favor...

474
00:50:24,491 --> 00:50:28,121
if you'll stop putting
those grand ideas into her head.

475
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:30,322
There were no complaints until you came.

476
00:50:30,397 --> 00:50:31,957
She did her work like the rest of us...

477
00:50:31,998 --> 00:50:35,628
like we all have to do if we want
to keep a roof over our heads.

478
00:50:35,902 --> 00:50:39,464
I have to tell you, Aggie,
you're the only woman she knows...

479
00:50:39,539 --> 00:50:42,373
and she'll be in need
of your sympathy and help.

480
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:45,707
- My help?
- Belinda's going to have a child.

481
00:50:51,885 --> 00:50:54,878
Oh, no. No, it's not true.

482
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:56,853
There isn't any doubt.

483
00:50:58,692 --> 00:51:00,854
When her father finds out, he'll kill her.

484
00:51:00,927 --> 00:51:02,862
That's why I told you.

485
00:51:03,163 --> 00:51:06,725
She doesn't know.
Doesn't even realize it herself yet.

486
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:10,598
- But he must find out.
- I'll tell him, at the right moment.

487
00:51:13,006 --> 00:51:14,440
Oh, it's....

488
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:17,438
Do you have any idea who the man was?

489
00:51:19,345 --> 00:51:20,438
No.

490
00:51:23,783 --> 00:51:26,275
Don't let anything happen to her.

491
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:32,689
I've been pretty brusque with her.

492
00:51:33,526 --> 00:51:35,757
You're making up for it now.

493
00:51:37,363 --> 00:51:39,889
We MacDonalds, we're high-tempered.

494
00:51:42,936 --> 00:51:45,235
We fight amongst ourselves...

495
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:48,702
but let trouble come from outside...

496
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,270
and we'll stick together.

497
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:08,707
We will open our services by singing
the first verse of hymn number 73.

498
00:55:07,907 --> 00:55:11,400
I'm requested to publish
the banns of marriage...

499
00:55:11,811 --> 00:55:14,280
between Laughlin McCormick
of Carcadie...

500
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:17,408
and Stella Maguire,
spinster of this parish.

501
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:20,979
If any of you know
cause or just impediment...

502
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:24,353
why these two persons should not
be joined together in holy matrimony...

503
00:55:24,457 --> 00:55:26,323
ye are to declare it.

504
00:55:27,293 --> 00:55:29,819
This is the first time of asking.

505
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:34,760
We will close our services
by singing hymn number 43.

506
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:38,100
You're the lucky one. Congratulations!

507
00:55:41,274 --> 00:55:44,802
Mr. MacDonald, I'm so happy
to see you at our church again...

508
00:55:44,877 --> 00:55:46,709
and Miss MacDonald.

509
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:51,947
I didn't know I could be so proud
of my own flesh and blood.

510
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:55,546
Did you see the way
they all turned and looked at her?

511
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:06,294
Well, Stella, this is quite a surprise.

512
00:56:06,532 --> 00:56:07,966
Thank you.

513
00:56:09,202 --> 00:56:11,194
Well, good luck to you.

514
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:13,068
When's the wedding?

515
00:57:03,389 --> 00:57:06,086
You mustn't forget your chores, girl.

516
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:25,335
Have you lost your mind,
Black MacDonald?

517
00:57:25,445 --> 00:57:26,504
What's the matter now?

518
00:57:26,612 --> 00:57:29,104
She's no mule! She can't stand all that.

519
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:33,244
What's got into you, woman?
I have to have this mash mixed, haven't I?

520
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:34,810
She's done it ever since we had pigs.

521
00:57:34,921 --> 00:57:37,584
Well, she won't do it anymore.
Now you leave her to me.

522
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:38,989
Sit down.

523
00:57:39,492 --> 00:57:42,985
You're as white as a sheet.
I'll get you some water.

524
00:57:48,201 --> 00:57:49,999
- Here.
- What's wrong with her?

525
00:57:50,103 --> 00:57:52,937
She's out of sorts.
The doctor told her to take it easy.

526
00:57:53,005 --> 00:57:57,375
Look, I work from 4:00 in the morning
till dark. Year in, year out.

527
00:57:57,477 --> 00:58:01,380
What she has to do is no hardship.
Belinda's a healthy girl.

528
00:58:02,515 --> 00:58:03,778
She's not.

529
00:58:04,117 --> 00:58:05,949
Now you leave her to me
and to the doctor.

530
00:58:06,018 --> 00:58:08,817
What do you make a mystery of it for?
She's my daughter.

531
00:58:08,888 --> 00:58:10,808
I've a right to know
if there's anything serious.

532
00:58:10,857 --> 00:58:14,021
Belinda's gonna have a.... A child.

533
00:58:15,995 --> 00:58:17,293
Oh, no.

534
00:58:17,964 --> 00:58:20,126
- It couldn't be.
- It's true.

535
00:58:21,868 --> 00:58:23,996
That dirty, filthy doctor!

536
00:58:24,137 --> 00:58:26,003
No! No, you're wrong.

537
00:58:26,806 --> 00:58:28,502
Who would it be then?

538
00:58:29,842 --> 00:58:31,333
I don't know.

539
00:58:31,544 --> 00:58:33,308
- Tell me his name.
- Hold your temper.

540
00:58:33,379 --> 00:58:36,315
Hold my temper?
What kind of a father do you think I am?

541
00:58:36,382 --> 00:58:37,982
Listen, child, who was it that hurt you?

542
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,416
How do you expect her to tell you?

543
00:58:39,519 --> 00:58:41,130
She doesn't know
what you're talking about.

544
00:58:41,154 --> 00:58:42,884
Keep out of this.

545
00:58:46,425 --> 00:58:50,829
Show me. Show me the man's name.
Who was it? Who was it that hurt you?

546
00:58:50,897 --> 00:58:52,388
She doesn't know! Leave her be.

547
00:58:52,498 --> 00:58:55,832
Don't be a fool, woman.
She's no babe in arms for all she's deaf.

548
00:58:55,902 --> 00:58:59,395
She's trying to shield the man.
Listen, child, show me.

549
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:02,905
Show me, I tell you.
Do I have to beat it out of you?

550
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:04,238
Oh, no. No, don't!

551
00:59:04,343 --> 00:59:05,888
Stop it!
You don't know what you're doing!

552
00:59:05,912 --> 00:59:08,381
- Let go of me! I got to find the man!
- Come to your senses!

553
00:59:08,447 --> 00:59:10,192
Even if she could talk,
she couldn't tell you.

554
00:59:10,216 --> 00:59:11,360
You've no right to go on this way.

555
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:14,081
- No right? I'm her father.
- Then act like a father!

556
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:16,782
Leave her be. I couldn't help it.

557
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:19,549
You're the one person that can give her
what she needs most:

558
00:59:19,625 --> 00:59:21,287
help, comfort, and understanding.

559
00:59:21,394 --> 00:59:24,387
What are you trying to do,
drive her insane?

560
00:59:25,798 --> 00:59:29,030
- I couldn't help it. Hard to go on....
- Aggie, come on. Take her to her room.

561
00:59:32,405 --> 00:59:34,704
- Have her get some rest.
- Yes.

562
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:37,408
Now, Mac, you've got to listen to me.

563
00:59:37,476 --> 00:59:39,502
I understand how you feel
and I don't blame you...

564
00:59:39,612 --> 00:59:42,013
but believe me,
it's blotted out of her mind.

565
00:59:42,114 --> 00:59:43,225
The way you forget a nightmare...

566
00:59:43,249 --> 00:59:45,369
because you don't wanna bring back
that terrible fear.

567
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:46,510
I've seen it in the war.

568
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:49,111
It's nature throwing up a barrier
to prevent something worse.

569
00:59:49,188 --> 00:59:50,816
I don't know what you're talking about.

570
00:59:50,923 --> 00:59:53,163
- I've got to find the man.
- What good will that do her?

571
00:59:53,192 --> 00:59:55,593
I'll lay what he done
before the men of the village.

572
00:59:55,661 --> 00:59:56,993
We'll show him what justice is.

573
00:59:57,096 --> 00:59:59,190
And even if you do,
how will that help the girl?

574
00:59:59,298 --> 01:00:00,994
Dragging her into a mess of scandal...

575
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,844
when she doesn't even know
what it's all about.

576
01:00:02,868 --> 01:00:05,963
- It'll crucify her. Is that what you want?
- You know it isn't.

577
01:00:06,806 --> 01:00:10,299
What am I going to do? The shame of it.

578
01:00:10,376 --> 01:00:14,313
Mac, you've got to think of her now,
not of yourself and your pride.

579
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:17,873
There's only one shame,
failing a human being who needs you.

580
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:25,458
I'm going up and talk to her now.

581
01:01:02,561 --> 01:01:04,928
He didn't mean to hurt you.

582
01:01:05,431 --> 01:01:08,060
He's just.... Just very worried.

583
01:01:09,368 --> 01:01:13,328
That's what makes him
seem harsh and unjust sometimes.

584
01:01:14,106 --> 01:01:15,870
He works so hard.

585
01:01:17,176 --> 01:01:20,704
That's why he hasn't been able
to give you more time.

586
01:01:21,914 --> 01:01:24,383
You've been alone so much, Belinda...

587
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:27,443
but you're not going to be alone anymore.

588
01:01:28,421 --> 01:01:30,913
You're going to be a mother.

589
01:01:45,404 --> 01:01:46,929
Yes, Belinda.

590
01:02:12,031 --> 01:02:15,365
You'll call it Johnny? But Belinda, you....

591
01:02:16,802 --> 01:02:17,929
Well...

592
01:02:18,304 --> 01:02:21,672
if you want it so much,
I guess you'll have a boy.

593
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:28,836
I'm sorry I couldn't get here any faster.

594
01:03:28,908 --> 01:03:30,788
The horse could hardly break
through the drifts.

595
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:32,504
I was that worried.

596
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:35,343
Now, Aggie, I want you to get me
some more hot water, lots of it.

597
01:03:35,414 --> 01:03:38,179
And woolen blankets. All you can find.

598
01:04:08,581 --> 01:04:11,278
Why does it take so long? It's hours.

599
01:04:11,784 --> 01:04:14,777
It's hard to get born and it's hard to die.

600
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:25,628
Do you have some brandy around?

601
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:27,424
I guess there's some.

602
01:04:46,819 --> 01:04:49,152
- Aggie, now hold that just like that.
- Yes.

603
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:52,885
- On the corners.
- Her not making a sound, it's uncanny.

604
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:03,560
Here, try to drink this.

605
01:05:16,215 --> 01:05:18,514
Got to keep that heart going.

606
01:06:22,214 --> 01:06:23,739
What are you bawling about?

607
01:06:23,816 --> 01:06:26,149
- How is she?
- She's all right.

608
01:06:27,252 --> 01:06:28,982
The baby's here.

609
01:06:30,422 --> 01:06:31,890
It's a boy.

610
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,863
Belinda, here's your boy.

611
01:06:59,184 --> 01:07:00,652
Can he talk?

612
01:07:05,524 --> 01:07:07,288
He certainly can.

613
01:08:08,087 --> 01:08:12,582
That ain't dirt, that's good clean earth.
That won't hurt Johnny none.

614
01:08:13,559 --> 01:08:17,257
I was brought up in a hog wallow.
You can't say I'm peaked.

615
01:08:39,418 --> 01:08:40,545
What's eating you now?

616
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:42,986
You don't get something for nothing
in this world.

617
01:08:43,088 --> 01:08:46,149
- What's that mean?
- It means no more credit.

618
01:08:46,925 --> 01:08:49,451
We've had bad years before,
he's never stopped our credit.

619
01:08:49,561 --> 01:08:50,972
Why didn't you try to reason with him?

620
01:08:50,996 --> 01:08:53,056
Because nobody would listen to me.

621
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:55,761
I don't dare show my face in the village.

622
01:08:55,834 --> 01:08:58,429
Everybody treating us like lepers.

623
01:08:58,604 --> 01:09:00,869
Come, Aggie.
It's not like a MacDonald to give up...

624
01:09:00,973 --> 01:09:03,442
because we're having a little hard time.

625
01:09:03,509 --> 01:09:05,842
- We'll manage.
- Manage, is it?

626
01:09:06,111 --> 01:09:09,013
And who's to manage the salt,
and the sugar, and the tea, and the like?

627
01:09:09,114 --> 01:09:10,514
Where are they to come from?

628
01:09:10,616 --> 01:09:13,381
We've managed to get deeper in debt
than anyone in Christendom.

629
01:09:13,485 --> 01:09:16,614
We've managed to shut our eyes
to everything that's happening.

630
01:09:16,688 --> 01:09:20,853
I don't even remember what
the grinding wheel sounds like anymore.

631
01:09:20,959 --> 01:09:22,450
Try managing that!

632
01:09:22,528 --> 01:09:26,659
He won't trust us for one more cent,
Pacquet won't, until that bill's paid.

633
01:09:37,376 --> 01:09:40,710
Them sheets are white as snow.
I bleached them extra special.

634
01:09:40,813 --> 01:09:43,681
The prettiest bride this town's ever seen,
that's what you'll be.

635
01:09:43,749 --> 01:09:45,843
- And who told you about it first?
- You did.

636
01:09:45,918 --> 01:09:49,184
The cards never lie. There he is.

637
01:09:50,689 --> 01:09:54,319
There'll be many a broken heart
come this Friday night.

638
01:10:00,232 --> 01:10:02,667
Hello, Stella. I can drop you off.

639
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:04,168
No, thanks.

640
01:10:04,336 --> 01:10:06,202
Wait a minute. What's the matter?

641
01:10:06,271 --> 01:10:09,730
Did Mrs. Poggety tell you to keep away
from men with blue eyes?

642
01:10:09,842 --> 01:10:12,744
A grown-up girl about to be married
swallowing that hocus--

643
01:10:12,845 --> 01:10:14,279
Can't you mind your own affairs?

644
01:10:14,379 --> 01:10:17,042
Always being so superior.
Always finding fault with everybody.

645
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:19,175
You of all people, after what you've done.

646
01:10:19,251 --> 01:10:21,516
- What have I done?
- You know well enough.

647
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:25,217
A girl who can't defend herself,
who can't even talk. Shaming her.

648
01:10:25,290 --> 01:10:27,088
What do you mean?

649
01:10:27,593 --> 01:10:29,858
Who said it? Locky?

650
01:10:30,762 --> 01:10:33,891
Everybody says it.
The whole village is talking about it.

651
01:10:34,433 --> 01:10:36,698
That's why nobody calls you.

652
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:39,065
So Locky said it.

653
01:10:40,038 --> 01:10:42,405
I wouldn't have thought
you'd believe that, Stella.

654
01:10:56,722 --> 01:10:58,247
Fog's rolling in.

655
01:10:58,323 --> 01:11:01,316
Can hear the lighthouse
sounding off already.

656
01:11:01,426 --> 01:11:03,054
Won't help the crops any.

657
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:06,098
The poorer the crops,
the peskier the crows.

658
01:11:09,668 --> 01:11:10,829
Mac.

659
01:11:12,271 --> 01:11:15,901
They're saying in the village
that I'm Johnny's father.

660
01:11:16,842 --> 01:11:18,538
It's believable.

661
01:11:18,644 --> 01:11:20,613
When they don't know the answer,
they make up one.

662
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:23,979
I've been around this place a lot.
At all hours.

663
01:11:25,784 --> 01:11:28,549
I've been thinking about this
for a long time.

664
01:11:28,654 --> 01:11:32,113
I've even thought of your leaving here,
but that wouldn't prove anything...

665
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:35,217
giving up something
you've worked for all your life.

666
01:11:35,327 --> 01:11:38,957
I know of only one solution.
For me to marry Belinda.

667
01:11:39,831 --> 01:11:43,233
That would really give them
something to talk about.

668
01:11:43,335 --> 01:11:46,737
And pretty soon
the gossip would die down for good.

669
01:11:47,539 --> 01:11:50,338
You're being generous, but it won't do.

670
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:55,540
You see, she kind of feels things,
and people, with her insides.

671
01:11:56,915 --> 01:12:00,647
You don't love her,
you only feel a kind of pity for her.

672
01:12:01,687 --> 01:12:04,350
You'd hurt her worse
than if you hated her.

673
01:12:04,423 --> 01:12:06,824
Make me feel pretty cheap.

674
01:12:07,592 --> 01:12:11,654
For a while there I guess I was thinking
I was quite a guy.

675
01:12:12,731 --> 01:12:15,428
You're one of the best I've run across.

676
01:12:15,534 --> 01:12:19,335
Sometimes you can be too good.
Harm others while doing it.

677
01:12:20,839 --> 01:12:22,740
Well, look who's here.

678
01:12:24,376 --> 01:12:26,607
I have something for Johnny.

679
01:12:30,515 --> 01:12:32,507
You can see him. Watch.

680
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:39,517
Yes, you can see him hear.

681
01:12:42,227 --> 01:12:43,889
- Coming up a blow.
- A storm?

682
01:12:43,962 --> 01:12:47,194
Coming straight in.
I better get the cattle in.

683
01:12:49,368 --> 01:12:51,894
I'll stay here. He has it.

684
01:13:35,747 --> 01:13:36,942
Mac?

685
01:13:40,786 --> 01:13:41,947
Mac!

686
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:57,664
Well.

687
01:14:02,207 --> 01:14:04,199
You don't know me, huh?

688
01:14:04,543 --> 01:14:06,478
You ought to, though.

689
01:14:13,051 --> 01:14:15,179
What are you doing in here?

690
01:14:15,987 --> 01:14:18,718
I just come by
to see about some ground barley.

691
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:21,186
That's a cute lad. Never seen him before.

692
01:14:21,259 --> 01:14:22,386
Keep away from him.

693
01:14:22,494 --> 01:14:25,430
What's the matter?
No harm in looking at him, is there?

694
01:14:25,530 --> 01:14:28,056
- Don't be scared. I'm Locky.
- Take your hands off him.

695
01:14:28,166 --> 01:14:31,330
All right, all right.
He's a big boy, isn't he?

696
01:14:32,504 --> 01:14:34,769
Spitting image of his father.

697
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:45,375
Well, all right, if you don't want business,
I can go somewheres else.

698
01:15:29,561 --> 01:15:31,757
- Where you going?
- With you.

699
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:34,265
- Well, where to?
- Wherever you're going.

700
01:15:34,332 --> 01:15:36,233
- Why?
- To tell them.

701
01:15:37,469 --> 01:15:39,802
- To tell them what?
- What you done.

702
01:15:40,138 --> 01:15:44,166
- So they'll know how low a man can get.
- You'll tell them nothing.

703
01:15:48,647 --> 01:15:50,411
Go ahead, walk.

704
01:17:04,356 --> 01:17:05,949
Something's wrong?

705
01:17:10,695 --> 01:17:12,254
What's happened?

706
01:17:14,766 --> 01:17:16,428
Belinda, what's the matter?

707
01:17:28,913 --> 01:17:31,576
Belinda, what is it? What's bothering you?

708
01:17:31,950 --> 01:17:33,248
Belinda.

709
01:18:17,896 --> 01:18:20,456
"Our Father, which art in heaven...

710
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:24,492
"hallowed be thy name.

711
01:18:27,005 --> 01:18:29,167
"Thy kingdom come.

712
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,702
"Thy will be done...

713
01:18:35,714 --> 01:18:39,151
"in earth, as it is in heaven.

714
01:18:48,193 --> 01:18:52,722
"Give us this day our daily bread.

715
01:18:55,266 --> 01:18:57,201
"Forgive us our debts...

716
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:02,434
"as we forgive our debtors.

717
01:19:03,708 --> 01:19:06,940
"Lead us not into temptation.

718
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,948
"Deliver us from evil.

719
01:19:13,785 --> 01:19:16,118
"For thine is the kingdom...

720
01:19:17,055 --> 01:19:18,614
"and the power...

721
01:19:20,225 --> 01:19:21,853
"and the glory...

722
01:19:23,261 --> 01:19:26,857
"for ever and ever.

723
01:19:31,269 --> 01:19:32,601
"Amen."

724
01:20:04,569 --> 01:20:06,663
He's trying to sell him
his horse and buggy, he is.

725
01:20:06,771 --> 01:20:08,899
He stopped talking when I came in,
but I heard enough.

726
01:20:08,973 --> 01:20:10,942
But what will he do without them?
A doctor.

727
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,773
What practice he has he can cover afoot.

728
01:20:12,844 --> 01:20:14,142
Just to the mill and back.

729
01:20:14,245 --> 01:20:17,738
His luck's run out, that's what.
I saw it in the cards, so help me.

730
01:20:17,816 --> 01:20:21,116
Black. Spades, spades, spades,
no matter where I put them.

731
01:20:31,463 --> 01:20:34,695
That rig is worth
two times more than this bill.

732
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,560
I make business and I have the right...

733
01:20:37,669 --> 01:20:39,900
to get back what is owed me
all fair and honorable.

734
01:20:40,004 --> 01:20:42,473
But I do not want people saying
that I take advantage.

735
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:44,839
You don't understand.
You'd be doing me a favor.

736
01:20:44,909 --> 01:20:46,172
I have to get rid of them.

737
01:20:46,244 --> 01:20:49,737
You mean, something is wrong?
The horse is lame, maybe, yes?

738
01:20:49,848 --> 01:20:52,477
No, he's sturdy as a horse.

739
01:20:52,851 --> 01:20:55,343
But I'm in a hurry,
so I have to take what I can get.

740
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:58,413
- I'm leaving here for good.
- You are? When?

741
01:20:59,090 --> 01:21:00,581
You seem pleased about it.

742
01:21:00,692 --> 01:21:02,991
- No, I think it's better for you.
- Why?

743
01:21:03,061 --> 01:21:06,156
You see, in this village,
we do not appreciate people coming here.

744
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:09,065
Strangers who do not follow
our ways of living.

745
01:21:09,167 --> 01:21:12,660
There are men here who can be very angry
and something can happen.

746
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:14,399
- What?
- Anything.

747
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,332
Look, Pacquet,
put away the tar and feathers.

748
01:21:17,408 --> 01:21:19,741
Do you want the rig or don't you?

749
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:38,256
She's as pretty as a picture.

750
01:21:48,606 --> 01:21:51,405
Good luck, my boy. Now you can pay me.

751
01:21:51,476 --> 01:21:53,809
You know I can. And I want that boat back.

752
01:21:53,912 --> 01:21:55,574
You will have it.

753
01:21:59,884 --> 01:22:02,718
- You've a good man, Stella.
- Thank you, Pacquet.

754
01:22:04,989 --> 01:22:06,719
Charlotte, catch!

755
01:22:12,163 --> 01:22:13,324
- Bye!
- Bye!

756
01:22:13,565 --> 01:22:16,797
It's about time Locky settled down.
He's led a stormy youth.

757
01:22:16,901 --> 01:22:18,597
Out on the ocean, you mean, Mrs. McKee.

758
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:19,968
You know what I mean.

759
01:22:40,358 --> 01:22:44,523
Belinda, I want you
to promise me something.

760
01:22:46,264 --> 01:22:48,631
If anything ever happens to Johnny...

761
01:22:49,367 --> 01:22:51,802
I want you to send for Dr. Gray.

762
01:22:54,839 --> 01:22:57,741
I couldn't come, Belinda. I won't be here.

763
01:22:57,909 --> 01:22:59,741
I have to go away.

764
01:23:00,912 --> 01:23:04,508
After all, I'm a doctor.
I can't help anyone this way.

765
01:23:05,416 --> 01:23:07,976
I can't even make a living for myself.

766
01:23:08,052 --> 01:23:10,647
Anyway, it's the only thing to do.

767
01:23:11,489 --> 01:23:13,515
So I made an application.

768
01:23:14,092 --> 01:23:15,993
I made an application.

769
01:23:19,163 --> 01:23:22,531
A staff job at the Toronto Hospital,
and they've taken me on.

770
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,569
I got the answer today.

771
01:23:27,772 --> 01:23:30,867
Do you understand?
Do you understand, Belinda?

772
01:23:32,276 --> 01:23:33,938
In a month or two...

773
01:23:34,045 --> 01:23:37,209
I'll be able to take care of things,
help you out.

774
01:23:37,281 --> 01:23:39,546
I've talked it over with Aggie.

775
01:23:39,951 --> 01:23:43,615
You see, the trouble is
I have to leave very soon.

776
01:23:44,088 --> 01:23:45,886
Tomorrow, in fact.

777
01:23:49,961 --> 01:23:52,726
No, Belinda. I won't be able to come.

778
01:23:53,398 --> 01:23:55,526
I'm going across the Gulf.

779
01:24:03,641 --> 01:24:05,473
Yes, very far away.

780
01:24:12,784 --> 01:24:14,650
Yes, I'll be careful.

781
01:24:27,732 --> 01:24:29,098
Belinda....

782
01:24:43,848 --> 01:24:45,976
Forgive me, I didn't know.

783
01:24:56,761 --> 01:24:58,354
Don't be sorry.

784
01:24:59,497 --> 01:25:01,090
I'm very glad.

785
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:36,765
Come on.

786
01:25:38,002 --> 01:25:39,868
Hurry up, we're late.

787
01:25:39,937 --> 01:25:42,873
It is the honor of the community
we have to think of.

788
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:44,738
Respectable people do not stand by...

789
01:25:44,842 --> 01:25:48,108
and see shameful things like this happen,
and do nothing.

790
01:25:50,548 --> 01:25:53,245
As a member of the Town Council,
I say it is our duty...

791
01:25:53,351 --> 01:25:55,786
to correct this unfortunate situation.

792
01:25:55,887 --> 01:25:58,413
And we do not want anyone
to come from outside...

793
01:25:58,523 --> 01:25:59,923
and meddle in this.

794
01:26:00,024 --> 01:26:03,791
We want to do this quietly.
We can take care of it ourselves.

795
01:26:03,895 --> 01:26:05,022
Yes, Mrs. Moore?

796
01:26:05,096 --> 01:26:07,725
Isn't it cruel to take a baby away
from its mother?

797
01:26:07,799 --> 01:26:10,428
A creature who's a disgrace
to the whole village?

798
01:26:10,535 --> 01:26:13,232
Who can't even teach a child his prayers?

799
01:26:13,304 --> 01:26:16,138
Is it a crime to save a baby
from a life of misery?

800
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:20,371
These women can't provide for a child.
Already they've sold most of their cattle.

801
01:26:20,444 --> 01:26:22,936
The place is run down.
There's no man to work it.

802
01:26:23,047 --> 01:26:26,279
Why, the baby will be like her,
running loose like an animal.

803
01:26:26,384 --> 01:26:29,445
The doctor. When he finds out,
couldn't he make trouble?

804
01:26:29,554 --> 01:26:30,613
After what he did?

805
01:26:30,721 --> 01:26:32,656
Sneaking out of town
in the middle of the night?

806
01:26:32,757 --> 01:26:35,886
He will be too smart
to ever show his face here again.

807
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:39,988
I could almost feel sorry for her.
It's a good thing she can't think or feel.

808
01:26:40,097 --> 01:26:43,556
Nothing better could happen for the child
than the offer we got.

809
01:26:43,634 --> 01:26:47,127
He will have a name,
a home with respected parents...

810
01:26:47,405 --> 01:26:49,397
Mr. and Mrs. McCormick.

811
01:26:49,841 --> 01:26:52,106
Now, there's no need for a lot of red tape.

812
01:26:52,176 --> 01:26:55,010
All we have to do is
get the release from the girl.

813
01:26:55,112 --> 01:26:58,139
She only has to sign it.
It is an easy thing to make a cross.

814
01:26:58,249 --> 01:27:02,619
With the release we send this petition.
I do not think there will be any trouble.

815
01:27:04,088 --> 01:27:07,286
If the girl had normal intelligence
she would be grateful.

816
01:27:14,832 --> 01:27:16,460
What are you stopping for?

817
01:27:16,534 --> 01:27:19,299
Let's end this bickering.
He has the makings of a fine, sturdy lad.

818
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,181
I'm telling you again,
I'd sooner not take him...

819
01:27:21,205 --> 01:27:23,016
than let you turn him
into a thickheaded farmer.

820
01:27:23,040 --> 01:27:25,475
And I tell you he'll have to earn his keep
when he's growed.

821
01:27:25,543 --> 01:27:27,020
What if he gets sick? It'll cost money.

822
01:27:27,044 --> 01:27:29,513
Whose money?
I don't recall you bringing in any.

823
01:27:29,614 --> 01:27:32,209
Well, it's ours, ain't it? You're my wife.

824
01:27:32,316 --> 01:27:34,842
And you expect me to pay for the honor?

825
01:27:34,919 --> 01:27:36,012
You needn't worry.

826
01:27:36,087 --> 01:27:37,965
I'm not fooling myself
about why you married me.

827
01:27:37,989 --> 01:27:39,589
And I know what started you on the idea.

828
01:27:39,690 --> 01:27:42,489
You want the kid because of that doctor.
'Cause you think it's his.

829
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,705
You're sweet on him
and couldn't hogtie him for yourself.

830
01:27:44,729 --> 01:27:46,220
I loathe him.

831
01:27:46,597 --> 01:27:49,089
A man that would do a thing like that.

832
01:27:50,001 --> 01:27:51,801
All right,
then don't think to pamper the boy.

833
01:27:51,869 --> 01:27:53,497
He'll work as soon as he's able.

834
01:27:53,838 --> 01:27:55,830
Giddap there. Giddap.

835
01:28:04,215 --> 01:28:06,582
I'll go by myself. Give me the letter.

836
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:08,585
What for?
She won't understand it anyhow.

837
01:28:08,686 --> 01:28:10,552
Give me that letter.

838
01:28:15,192 --> 01:28:18,788
Can't hear, can't read.
And don't be all day about it.

839
01:28:53,431 --> 01:28:54,729
My coat?

840
01:29:05,743 --> 01:29:07,769
May I see the baby?

841
01:29:16,120 --> 01:29:17,748
May I hold him?

842
01:29:19,490 --> 01:29:21,083
May I hold him?

843
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:03,763
Belinda.

844
01:30:06,737 --> 01:30:09,332
Would you let me take care of him?

845
01:30:10,608 --> 01:30:13,840
I mean, take him home just for a while.

846
01:30:15,546 --> 01:30:17,538
He'd be very happy,
he'd have everything he wants.

847
01:30:17,615 --> 01:30:20,244
You could see him whenever you like.

848
01:30:20,351 --> 01:30:22,217
Please let me, just for a little while.

849
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:24,278
You have all this work.

850
01:30:25,256 --> 01:30:28,749
Why not, Belinda? I only want to help you,
can't you understand?

851
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:45,300
Just sign here. Just make a cross.

852
01:31:07,398 --> 01:31:09,663
If you don't give him to me,
they'll come and take him.

853
01:31:09,767 --> 01:31:12,828
Belinda, listen, please! Let me take him.
I won't....

854
01:31:33,357 --> 01:31:35,690
- What's happened?
- Locky, I can't do it.

855
01:31:35,793 --> 01:31:37,091
What are you talking about?

856
01:31:37,161 --> 01:31:39,357
He's ours, been given to us,
all legal and proper.

857
01:31:39,463 --> 01:31:40,624
We must give him up.

858
01:31:40,698 --> 01:31:42,530
We're being mean, Locky,
mean to the Dummy.

859
01:31:42,633 --> 01:31:45,296
You think she had no feeling,
you should see her with the baby.

860
01:31:45,369 --> 01:31:48,339
We just can't take him, she's his mother.

861
01:31:48,639 --> 01:31:50,107
His mother.

862
01:31:50,808 --> 01:31:53,676
Well, let me tell you something.
I'm his father.

863
01:31:54,845 --> 01:31:55,972
What?

864
01:31:56,046 --> 01:31:58,709
His father, I'm telling you!
He's as much mine as hers.

865
01:31:58,816 --> 01:32:01,285
Locky, I told you to keep away from her.

866
01:32:01,352 --> 01:32:04,880
It's all over and in the past.
Unfortunate it is, it happened.

867
01:32:04,989 --> 01:32:07,823
A man wants children and I want him.

868
01:32:08,959 --> 01:32:12,691
Something in here wants him.
By the Godfrey, I'll have him!

869
01:32:25,242 --> 01:32:26,904
Where's the kid?

870
01:32:28,846 --> 01:32:30,678
Get out of the way.

871
01:34:02,439 --> 01:34:05,102
It is the duty of the Crown Prosecutor...

872
01:34:05,175 --> 01:34:07,804
to present the facts
which will prove to you...

873
01:34:07,878 --> 01:34:12,441
that beyond a doubt,
Belinda MacDonald is guilty of murder.

874
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:15,512
This is a difficult case...

875
01:34:15,686 --> 01:34:19,054
due to the unfortunate circumstances
of the accused.

876
01:34:19,156 --> 01:34:23,355
But you and I, gentlemen,
must not allow these circumstances...

877
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:27,329
to bring about an undue amount
of sympathy for the accused.

878
01:34:28,165 --> 01:34:33,001
A murder has been committed
and the full penalty must be paid.

879
01:34:37,841 --> 01:34:40,777
Is there any reason you know of,
Mrs. McCormick...

880
01:34:40,878 --> 01:34:43,746
why she should have killed your husband?

881
01:34:50,054 --> 01:34:51,181
No.

882
01:34:52,222 --> 01:34:54,453
- Your witness.
- No questions.

883
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:56,918
Miss MacDonald.

884
01:34:59,063 --> 01:35:00,964
When the McCormicks...

885
01:35:04,134 --> 01:35:06,763
arrived that afternoon...

886
01:35:07,604 --> 01:35:11,405
is it true that you were
in the house alone?

887
01:35:19,149 --> 01:35:21,050
Does she understand?

888
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,489
Well, what did she answer?

889
01:35:32,596 --> 01:35:35,725
She's not answering my question.
She hasn't answered any of my questions.

890
01:35:35,799 --> 01:35:38,667
All she says is,
"I want my baby, I want my baby."

891
01:35:44,942 --> 01:35:47,741
There, "Tell them
to give me my baby, please."

892
01:35:47,811 --> 01:35:50,610
The defendant obviously
doesn't want to answer the question.

893
01:35:50,681 --> 01:35:52,081
My Lord...

894
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:55,176
under the circumstances,
the defendant is naturally confused.

895
01:35:55,285 --> 01:35:58,119
Apparently she does not understand
the interpreter.

896
01:35:58,188 --> 01:36:01,420
Since she was trained in the sign language
by one of the witnesses...

897
01:36:01,492 --> 01:36:03,188
Dr. Richardson...

898
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,159
would it be permissible
for him to translate for her?

899
01:36:06,263 --> 01:36:09,427
- Permission granted.
- Dr. Robert Richardson.

900
01:36:20,711 --> 01:36:24,705
Would you mind facing her directly
so that she can read your lips?

901
01:36:27,885 --> 01:36:30,286
Were you alone in the house...

902
01:36:30,487 --> 01:36:33,150
when the McCormicks came to see you?

903
01:36:34,558 --> 01:36:36,356
Did you understand?

904
01:36:40,631 --> 01:36:41,894
"I was with my baby."

905
01:36:41,999 --> 01:36:44,696
After you attacked Mrs. McCormick
and she ran out--

906
01:36:44,802 --> 01:36:46,168
I object, My Lord.

907
01:36:46,236 --> 01:36:49,365
The defendant has not admitted
attacking Mrs. McCormick.

908
01:36:49,473 --> 01:36:50,839
Objection sustained.

909
01:36:50,908 --> 01:36:53,275
I'll phrase the question differently.

910
01:36:53,377 --> 01:36:56,211
After Mrs. McCormick left,
what did you do?

911
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:59,409
Isn't it true that as soon as she left
you went to get the gun?

912
01:37:04,054 --> 01:37:05,454
"I was very much afraid."

913
01:37:05,556 --> 01:37:07,286
So you did take the gun deliberately?

914
01:37:07,391 --> 01:37:08,620
Objection!

915
01:37:08,725 --> 01:37:10,626
The defendant has made
no such admission.

916
01:37:10,727 --> 01:37:11,751
My Lord--

917
01:37:11,862 --> 01:37:14,297
If the Prosecution will be patient,
I might be able to help.

918
01:37:14,398 --> 01:37:17,368
Please try to understand
what it means to be as she is...

919
01:37:17,434 --> 01:37:19,426
living in a world apart,
shut off from everyone...

920
01:37:19,536 --> 01:37:21,437
never hearing the warmth
of a human voice.

921
01:37:21,538 --> 01:37:23,530
Think of the loneliness and the fear.

922
01:37:23,607 --> 01:37:27,476
These people, although tutored,
are governed almost solely by intuition.

923
01:37:27,578 --> 01:37:29,911
Belinda's been instructed
in certain fundamentals.

924
01:37:29,980 --> 01:37:31,458
- She knows right from wrong...
- My Lord--

925
01:37:31,482 --> 01:37:34,941
...but something in her was stronger than
the precept, "Thou shalt not kill."

926
01:37:35,052 --> 01:37:36,247
My Lord, I object.

927
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:40,553
Dr. Richardson is completely out of order.
He's not the counsel for the accused.

928
01:37:40,624 --> 01:37:44,061
Your Lordship, I insist this girl obeyed
an impulse older than the laws of man:

929
01:37:44,127 --> 01:37:47,256
The instinct of a mother
to protect her child.

930
01:37:47,664 --> 01:37:49,758
Any further breach of your capacity
as interpreter...

931
01:37:49,833 --> 01:37:52,803
I shall hold as in contempt of this court.

932
01:37:53,670 --> 01:37:55,502
Objection sustained.

933
01:37:55,639 --> 01:37:56,732
Now please proceed.

934
01:38:00,143 --> 01:38:02,237
When did you get the gun?

935
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:04,812
After Locky McCormick came in?

936
01:38:05,616 --> 01:38:06,982
"Yes." Why?

937
01:38:11,989 --> 01:38:14,458
"I was afraid he would hurt my baby."

938
01:38:14,525 --> 01:38:16,653
And that was your only motive?

939
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,286
Was there any other reason
why you were afraid of him?

940
01:38:19,363 --> 01:38:22,333
Your Lordship! The interpreter,
in rephrasing my question...

941
01:38:22,432 --> 01:38:24,094
is trying to coach the defendant.

942
01:38:24,167 --> 01:38:26,500
This man is totally unqualified.

943
01:38:26,603 --> 01:38:29,300
He's deeply involved in the case himself
and I can prove it.

944
01:38:29,373 --> 01:38:31,274
May I present new evidence?

945
01:38:31,341 --> 01:38:34,311
- Has it any bearing on this testimony?
- It has.

946
01:38:34,378 --> 01:38:36,176
Permission granted.

947
01:38:39,449 --> 01:38:42,442
Dr. Richardson,
in your earlier testimony...

948
01:38:42,519 --> 01:38:46,183
didn't you deny being the father
of Belinda MacDonald's child?

949
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:48,452
- I did.
- Did you write this?

950
01:38:48,692 --> 01:38:49,716
I did.

951
01:38:49,826 --> 01:38:52,295
I should like to read a passage
from this letter.

952
01:38:52,362 --> 01:38:54,888
"...physician takes a lot more time....

953
01:38:55,132 --> 01:38:57,192
"Work is hard. Be here soon.

954
01:38:57,301 --> 01:38:59,327
"I have found a house for us.

955
01:38:59,403 --> 01:39:02,373
"It is small but it has
a beautifully sunny room...

956
01:39:02,472 --> 01:39:04,407
"for our little son."

957
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:11,743
I challenge this man's integrity
as a witness and as an individual.

958
01:39:11,848 --> 01:39:14,340
His actions speak for themselves.

959
01:39:14,551 --> 01:39:17,680
Betraying this girl,
ignobly fleeing scandal.

960
01:39:18,088 --> 01:39:20,182
He's laid himself open
to a charge of perjury.

961
01:39:20,257 --> 01:39:23,750
His very appearance here is an affront
to the dignity of this court.

962
01:39:23,860 --> 01:39:26,625
He has violated the ethics
of an honorable profession.

963
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:28,961
He should be stricken
from the medical register...

964
01:39:29,066 --> 01:39:31,399
expelled from decent society.

965
01:39:31,468 --> 01:39:33,369
No! No!

966
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,906
It was Locky's fault!

967
01:39:38,976 --> 01:39:42,970
It was him, Locky. He's the baby's father.
It was his fault!

968
01:39:43,947 --> 01:39:46,610
He told me
the day we went to get the baby.

969
01:39:46,717 --> 01:39:48,777
I wanted the baby but...

970
01:39:49,553 --> 01:39:52,045
somehow when I saw her with him
I couldn't.

971
01:39:52,122 --> 01:39:55,456
I said, "We shouldn't, it's mean,
she's his mother."

972
01:39:55,559 --> 01:39:58,051
And he said.... He said:

973
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:01,426
"I'm his father."

974
01:40:14,011 --> 01:40:17,140
In this court's opinion,
the evidence is incontrovertible.

975
01:40:17,247 --> 01:40:19,182
That she acted in defense of her home...

976
01:40:19,282 --> 01:40:21,979
against a man
whose guilt has been proven.

977
01:40:22,085 --> 01:40:24,247
The court expresses the hope
that the jury's verdict...

978
01:40:24,321 --> 01:40:27,086
will stand as a reminder
that justice in this Dominion...

979
01:40:27,157 --> 01:40:29,319
will always protect the private citizen...

980
01:40:29,426 --> 01:40:31,952
against those who would interfere
with his rights...

981
01:40:32,029 --> 01:40:34,589
and his dignity as a human being.

982
01:40:39,202 --> 01:40:41,967
I'm glad that it turned out the way it did.

983
01:40:57,821 --> 01:41:01,053
I know, Belinda.
You don't have to say anything.
