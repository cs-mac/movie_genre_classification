1
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- He's written from America.
- What's he say?

2
00:02:36,636 --> 00:02:40,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They eat everything
out of cans over there.

3
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:43,171  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The first image of Rome
was a centuries-old stone...

4
00:02:43,243 --> 00:02:48,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
rising out of the fields
just out side my hometown.

5
00:02:52,586 --> 00:02:58,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Later on, at school, we were told
other interesting things about Rome.

6
00:03:03,396 --> 00:03:06,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the Rubicon...

7
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:12,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the river Julius Caesar crossed,
saying, ''Alea iacta est!''

8
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Take off your shoes, children.
- Take off your shoes...

9
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,771  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and we'll cross
the river together.

10
00:03:21,014 --> 00:03:23,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alea iacta est!

11
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:28,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- To Rome.
- To Rome!

12
00:04:06,993 --> 00:04:09,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Now we've got another meanie
by the name of Mussolini.

13
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:12,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Julius Caesar took a chance
and led his army into France.

14
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,432  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In those days the French were Gauls
and Caesar a man with balls.''

15
00:04:18,838 --> 00:04:22,831  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bring me then Metellus Cimbers's
petition and I shall examine it.

16
00:04:22,909 --> 00:04:25,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And now, hands,
speak for me.

17
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You too, Brutus.

18
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,021  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My son.

19
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Julius Caesar.

20
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:22,825  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sir, if I may say so,
last night you had us all in tears.

21
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,529  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was a real
artistic performance.

22
00:05:25,605 --> 00:05:29,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Eternal gratitude
to our humble webfooted friends.

23
00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:38,383  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To our humble webfooted friends
with their excited quacking.

24
00:05:39,119 --> 00:05:41,713  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It is always that one, sir.
Always the same one.

25
00:05:45,325 --> 00:05:50,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Woke the soldiers who picked up
their weapons and saved Rome.

26
00:05:52,165 --> 00:05:55,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you can hear their descendants
quacking right outside the window.

27
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Careful, now. Careful.

28
00:05:59,673 --> 00:06:02,107  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Return to your seats.

29
00:06:06,012 --> 00:06:10,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't tolerate any disorder.
Stop it.

30
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You are not out in the streets now.
You're in school!

31
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:16,787  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Barbetti! Stacchiotti! Barilazzi!
I'll beat you to death, by God!

32
00:06:16,856 --> 00:06:20,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In saecula saeculorum, amen.
On your feet.

33
00:06:20,827 --> 00:06:22,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Rings.

34
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:25,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Napkins.

35
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Dismissed.

36
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,806  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silence. Order.

37
00:06:36,643 --> 00:06:38,907  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Order and silence.

38
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:48,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The bronze she-wolf
at the Capitol.

39
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:57,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Santa Maria Maggiore,
one of the four Roman basilicas.

40
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:05,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The tomb of Cecilia Metella
on the Appia Antica.

41
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Arch of Constantine.

42
00:07:11,544 --> 00:07:13,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The altar of the fatherland.

43
00:07:17,717 --> 00:07:20,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
St. Peter's,
Holy Mother Church's greatest temple.

44
00:07:27,927 --> 00:07:30,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn it off!
Turn on the lights, somebody!

45
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:32,087  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The lights!

46
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:36,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't look, children.
Close your eyes. It's the devil.

47
00:07:37,036 --> 00:07:41,166  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whoever looks will go to hell.
Keep your eyes closed.

48
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:45,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It's the devil! The devil!
- Good Lord! On your feet!

49
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:02,160  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But church bells
are the voice of God.

50
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:04,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We should turn
on the radio, signora.

51
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:07,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- There's a blessing from the Pope.
- Just bring the soup here, you idiot!

52
00:08:07,867 --> 00:08:10,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Stay where you are!
- But, Severino, it's a papal blessing.

53
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:12,870  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So put it on the salad!

54
00:08:12,939 --> 00:08:15,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Shame on you. You'll go to hell.
- Stay where you are.

55
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:20,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
On your knees. Don't pay attention
to your good-for-nothing father.

56
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Drop dead, you old bat!

57
00:08:44,304 --> 00:08:48,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For heaven's sake, folks, there's
no need to push. We've got enough seats.

58
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:51,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Three adults, two children
and one maid. What?

59
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,240  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Full price for a maid?
Well, I'll be damned.

60
00:08:56,115 --> 00:08:57,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shut up!
Adele, keep an eye on that kid.

61
00:08:57,784 --> 00:08:59,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Carmela, the baby!

62
00:08:59,419 --> 00:09:02,684  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hang on to my coat and follow me.
Excuse me. Pardon me.

63
00:09:02,755 --> 00:09:06,020  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Besides, there's three shows today.
Come back later.

64
00:09:10,063 --> 00:09:12,725  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
May the gods smile upon you,
Pompeo.

65
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:15,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l have come
to bid you farewell.

66
00:09:16,069 --> 00:09:21,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
With what adventures,
Priscilla the Christian?

67
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:24,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l have a generous nature.
But vengeance is a temptress.

68
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:27,874  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Be on your guard, both of you.
- And yet, l love her.

69
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:37,119  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, no, have mercy!

70
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l beg you, mercy!
Let me go!

71
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:46,888  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are some seats. Hurry! Adele!
Leonina! You sit over there.

72
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:51,460  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- My wife's purse was on that seat.
- Purses don't count.

73
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Carmela, the baby!

74
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:04,369  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sir, you are an ill-mannered boor,
that's what you are.

75
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:08,938  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you don't seem to realize who I am.
I'm the school principal, that's who.

76
00:11:09,015 --> 00:11:13,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The principal, understand?

77
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:17,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Rome: the parade of October 28
was in an atmosphere of enthusiasm.

78
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The entire city was there to greet
our leader and proclaim its faith...

79
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:24,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in the glorious and indomitable
destiny of the imperial fatherland.

80
00:11:25,798 --> 00:11:29,199  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His Excellency S. De Carolis
took part in the jump through the hoop.

81
00:11:29,268 --> 00:11:31,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a man.

82
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:36,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sons of the she-wolf flocked
to the beaches of Rome where ltalians...

83
00:11:36,976 --> 00:11:39,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and their automobiles paraded
to the songs of the revolution...

84
00:11:39,979 --> 00:11:43,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
followed by a box lunch
which included bread...

85
00:11:43,082 --> 00:11:45,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
famous national cheeses
and piping red tea.

86
00:11:47,286 --> 00:11:51,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Florence: the magnificent
stone walls ofthe Pitti Palace...

87
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:54,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
seem to smile beneath
the warm, spring sunshine.

88
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:01,590  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This lady was the wife
of the local druggist.

89
00:12:01,667 --> 00:12:04,534  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everyone said
she was worse than Messalina.

90
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And no need to play with yourself.
That's what's nice about Rome.

91
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's big and nobody knows you.
You are free to come and go.

92
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,940  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about the Roman women?
What are they like?

93
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:53,577  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Roman women?
They've got an ass as wide as that.

94
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Quit fucking around
and get out of my way.

95
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry. I'm going.

96
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get your lottery tickets here.

97
00:14:50,703 --> 00:14:54,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Hey, kid, need a lighter?
- No, thanks. I've already got one.

98
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:57,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll give you, as a present,
a bolt of first-class English wool.

99
00:14:57,877 --> 00:14:59,811  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Got a place to sleep tonight?
- In Via Albalonga.

100
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:02,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I have a room with your own entrance
and a cute little French girl.

101
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:05,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No.

102
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,417  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hotel Dragoni.
Hotel Dragoni!

103
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:13,915  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Veal at four lire a pound.
What's this world coming to?

104
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:16,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's only two things
you can be sure of.

105
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:18,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's right.
Death and taxes.

106
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:34,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'm looking for the Palletta family.
- Fourth floor.

107
00:16:35,074 --> 00:16:37,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The elevator's broken.

108
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:41,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
David, I'm gonna beat
the hell outta you.

109
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:45,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There, stupid!

110
00:16:45,151 --> 00:16:47,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You always do it wrong.

111
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where can I find
the Palletta family?

112
00:16:56,729 --> 00:16:58,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

113
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:03,196  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He says to me, ''You kidding me
or are you really stupid?''

114
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''What do you mean?''

115
00:17:04,637 --> 00:17:08,334  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And he says, ''Aw, come on. You must
be kidding.'' I say, ''What do you mean?''

116
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:11,433  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- So?
- What do you mean, so?

117
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:16,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The solemn military and religious rites
at the tomb of the unknown.

118
00:17:16,315 --> 00:17:19,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm gonna throw the cat
out the window!

119
00:17:19,985 --> 00:17:23,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His Excellency Count Racobelli
attended and Mons. TroisiRagusa...

120
00:17:23,723 --> 00:17:25,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was there to represent
the Holy Sea.

121
00:17:27,293 --> 00:17:30,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Listen.

122
00:17:30,196 --> 00:17:33,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ciao. Is your mother home?

123
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello?

124
00:17:40,272 --> 00:17:42,206  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any body home?

125
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:45,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Signora?

126
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:49,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Antonietta! I did it!

127
00:17:49,415 --> 00:17:51,815  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stay there a minute.
I'm coming.

128
00:17:51,884 --> 00:17:56,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- There's someone at the door.
- I did it! I did it!

129
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,280  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Signora,
that young man is here...

130
00:17:58,357 --> 00:18:00,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the one whose mother wrote you
from up north.

131
00:18:00,693 --> 00:18:02,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shall I let him in?

132
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:10,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How do you do?
- I was making pasta. Let me help you.

133
00:18:10,603 --> 00:18:14,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Come in. Come in, please.
- Thanks.

134
00:18:14,173 --> 00:18:18,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The signora's not feeling very well.
Come on. This way.

135
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One of her ovaries
is inflamed.

136
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:24,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll just set it down here, all right?
Come on. I'll show you the house.

137
00:18:26,852 --> 00:18:29,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come in, come in.

138
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:33,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hope you don't mind children, 'cause
there's a lot of them living here.

139
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:38,462  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is the dining room.
Florentine furniture. Nice, huh?

140
00:18:38,531 --> 00:18:40,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- That's the signora's eldest son.
- Who is it?

141
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:43,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's gonna work as a clerk.

142
00:18:43,102 --> 00:18:46,094  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Why did you have to go to the beach?
- How do you do?

143
00:18:46,172 --> 00:18:50,541  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Why shouldn't I have gone?
- Did you have to go at noon?

144
00:18:50,609 --> 00:18:51,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When, then?

145
00:18:51,944 --> 00:18:53,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My poor baby.

146
00:18:56,081 --> 00:18:59,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A bad sunburn, huh?
Do you have a fever?

147
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:02,120  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think so, yeah.

148
00:19:02,188 --> 00:19:06,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Nice shirt you got there.
- Thank you.

149
00:19:11,831 --> 00:19:16,461  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You afraid of Chinamen? He is one
and he's even got kitchen privileges.

150
00:19:16,535 --> 00:19:21,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My God, it stinks in here. Why don't
you open the window when you cook?

151
00:19:26,946 --> 00:19:28,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bucatini matriciana sauce.
You like eat?

152
00:19:29,048 --> 00:19:31,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- No, thank you.
- Very good. Delicious.

153
00:19:31,484 --> 00:19:34,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me out of here
before I throw up.

154
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,185  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bucatini matriciana.
Yeah, for pigs.

155
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,687  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Signora,
shall I show him the kitchen?

156
00:19:43,762 --> 00:19:46,754  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, honey,
show him the kitchen.

157
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:51,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, my God! What have I done
to deserve such suffering?

158
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,331  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The kitchen's this way.

159
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:56,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- After you.
- No, please, after you.

160
00:19:59,144 --> 00:20:01,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Antonietta, I did it!

161
00:20:01,247 --> 00:20:03,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I did it! I did it!

162
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:05,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, so you did it.
You don't have to broadcast it.

163
00:20:05,584 --> 00:20:07,677  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just a moment.

164
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:13,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Ciao.
- Good afternoon.

165
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What did you bring me?
- Nothing, yet. What do you want?

166
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:21,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How about you?
You think there'll be a war?

167
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:26,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Wanna see the little granny?
- Sure. That's why I came.

168
00:20:26,305 --> 00:20:28,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Follow me.

169
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:30,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's littler than us kids.

170
00:20:34,113 --> 00:20:37,310  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Little granny!
Look who's here!

171
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:42,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Bless you.
- Thank you, and same to you.

172
00:20:42,187 --> 00:20:45,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bet your granny's not that little.
Bet your granny's not that little.

173
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:51,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's this?
- This is my room.

174
00:20:51,196 --> 00:20:53,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I haven't tidied up yet.

175
00:20:53,465 --> 00:20:56,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It's nice and sunny.
- Will you put down those scissors!

176
00:20:56,735 --> 00:21:00,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good afternoon.
Landi's the name. Marco Landi.

177
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:01,664  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Remember me?
- I think so.

178
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,176  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I made my debut with Camerini and I
worked a lot with Gennaro Righelli.

179
00:21:05,244 --> 00:21:07,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I play the part of the bon vivant.

180
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I was the butler in Heartthrob.
- Yes, of course.

181
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:15,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- But you're much too young to remember.
- No, I do. I really do.

182
00:21:15,154 --> 00:21:17,088  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By the way, you're a reporter,
aren't you?

183
00:21:17,156 --> 00:21:20,421  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I could give you an interview.
- Sure, except I'm not working yet.

184
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:24,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My friends, we have a newspaper
reporter among us.

185
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Hello.
- Hello.

186
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:31,429  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I presume you will be staying here.
- Enjoy your meal.

187
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:46,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I refuse to believe that the people
of Great Britain, always friends...

188
00:21:46,652 --> 00:21:50,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
feel it their duty to lead Europe
into a catastrophe...

189
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
by defending an African nation.

190
00:21:53,826 --> 00:21:55,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The resemblance is frightening.

191
00:21:55,928 --> 00:21:59,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Universally branded and without the
shadow of any kind of civilization...

192
00:21:59,264 --> 00:22:02,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
against this nation of heroes,
artists, poets, saints, navigators.

193
00:22:05,771 --> 00:22:07,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you want, Ma?

194
00:22:07,706 --> 00:22:10,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Send the young man in here.
I want to have a look.

195
00:22:10,976 --> 00:22:13,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Antonietta, she wants to see him.
- All right, miss.

196
00:22:13,879 --> 00:22:14,971  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shall I take him?

197
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:18,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If the Mediterranean
is a shortcut for England...

198
00:22:18,517 --> 00:22:22,112  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and a permanent zone for Russia,
for us Italians it is like itself.

199
00:22:24,623 --> 00:22:28,457  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep still for a minute
or you'll knock me over. May I come in?

200
00:22:28,527 --> 00:22:34,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- May I come in?
- Yes, and bring him with you.

201
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:44,197  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're so young
and distinguished-looking too.

202
00:22:44,276 --> 00:22:46,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll like it here.

203
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:49,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sure your mother wrote me,
you know. Poor woman.

204
00:22:49,148 --> 00:22:53,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Did you show him the house?
- Of course, and he liked it too.

205
00:22:53,852 --> 00:22:58,414  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good. You look like a nice boy.
That's all. You can go now.

206
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:01,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One more thing
before I forget.

207
00:23:02,327 --> 00:23:06,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look me in the eyes, boy. There's
to be no fooling around in this house.

208
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:10,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're churchgoing people. We respect
others and want respect in return.

209
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:13,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wouldn't come to your house
and do anything dirty.

210
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:18,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So let's live in peace
and not bust each other's balls.

211
00:23:19,111 --> 00:23:21,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ma, I don't want to eat today.

212
00:23:22,014 --> 00:23:24,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aren't you hungry, baby?

213
00:23:25,718 --> 00:23:28,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to lie next to you, Mama.

214
00:23:28,353 --> 00:23:31,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My God,
why couldn't you stay home?

215
00:23:58,183 --> 00:24:02,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We brought two chickens with us.
You want me to throw you in the oven?

216
00:24:06,592 --> 00:24:09,425  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And then we want
to eat at Ostia.

217
00:24:30,816 --> 00:24:32,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Sit down with us.

218
00:24:32,818 --> 00:24:36,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Marcello, give him a chair.
You're family now.

219
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:39,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'll put him with these friends, okay?
- Was it good?

220
00:24:39,124 --> 00:24:41,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's short pasta.

221
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, you don't.
I'll put the baby here.

222
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on. Sit down.

223
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:51,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know the saying:
''The devil takes whoever eats alone.''

224
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:55,573  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bucatini matriciana, cannolicchi
cheese and pepper, penne in hot sauce.

225
00:24:55,641 --> 00:24:57,836  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Have the penne in hot sauce.
- Let me make up my own mind.

226
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:01,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What do you think?
- Take my advice. Cheese and pepper.

227
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Cheese and pepper sauce. I already
had it for lunch. What else is there?

228
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How about rigatoni
in anchovy sauce?

229
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, spit out that gum. You're
gonna eat now. And you keep still.

230
00:25:12,925 --> 00:25:18,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fettuccine with chicken giblets,
and then there's our specialties:

231
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:22,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Kidneys, tripe, snails, veal.
- Maybe the schiaffoni?

232
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:24,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I may try them. Give me
a small portion because I had trouble...

233
00:25:24,803 --> 00:25:29,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- with my stomach all night long.
- Mama made pajata in the kitchen.

234
00:25:30,008 --> 00:25:33,239  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Take my advice. Have the pajata.
- What's that, pajata?

235
00:25:33,312 --> 00:25:36,372  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's calf gut fiilled with milk.

236
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:39,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remo, don't forget
this young gentleman.

237
00:25:39,418 --> 00:25:43,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here, eat some ofthese.
They're not snails. They're pigeons.

238
00:25:43,922 --> 00:25:48,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Giggetto, where are the bananas?
- Sorry. We're all out. Only got one.

239
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,828  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Then give me that one.
- You think I am crazy?

240
00:25:52,898 --> 00:25:56,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who's that, Lallo's daughter?
- Whose do you think, the priest's?

241
00:25:56,802 --> 00:26:00,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She that big already? Isn't she cute?
Can't tell her face from her behind.

242
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:05,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I dreamt about poor Aunt Judy last night
and asked her a winning number.

243
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:07,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then she fried this broccoli with
a mint leaf. You should have tasted it.

244
00:26:07,512 --> 00:26:11,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know what they say:
''The more you eat, the more you shit.''

245
00:26:14,086 --> 00:26:19,615  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I told you not to let him eat any tripe.
He's had a fever since then.

246
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:21,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, then give him
a couple of snails.

247
00:26:29,268 --> 00:26:31,998  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- But it almost killed him.
- Then I guess it'll kill me too.

248
00:26:43,081 --> 00:26:46,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give her something to drink
so she'll shut her trap.

249
00:26:46,151 --> 00:26:48,642  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Cheers!
- Go on. Drink up.

250
00:27:02,901 --> 00:27:05,165  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Verna! Verna!
Come on down!

251
00:27:06,238 --> 00:27:09,401  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you forget about it
and get down here?

252
00:27:11,209 --> 00:27:14,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come here before I beat
the hell out of you. Come on.

253
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell your sister to get down here
before I throw her off that balcony.

254
00:27:31,163 --> 00:27:35,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Talk about a small portion.
This plate's practically empty.

255
00:27:42,474 --> 00:27:45,170  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're out of this world,
Mrs. Rossi.

256
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:47,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Here, kid. Enjoy your meal, folks.
- Thanks.

257
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:51,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Bon appetit.
- Thank you. Say thank you.

258
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:55,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Slowly. Don't eat so fast
or you'll choke to death.

259
00:27:58,557 --> 00:28:03,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nobody's going
to steal your plate.

260
00:28:03,128 --> 00:28:06,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Something's been sitting on my stomach
since yesterday morning.

261
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me something.
You like soccer?

262
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Silvano! Silvano! Here she is!
I brought her down.

263
00:28:13,138 --> 00:28:15,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Finally.

264
00:28:16,641 --> 00:28:20,941  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here she is, everybody.
''Verna the Sulker'' has arrived.

265
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:29,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What--
Now what's the matter?

266
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:38,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Come on. Let's make up. Come on.
- Just leave me in peace.

267
00:28:38,096 --> 00:28:41,554  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Open that sweet little mouth of yours.
Come on. Open it.

268
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You silly, stupid shit.
- You're the stupid shit.

269
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Not me. You. That's who.
- You are both stupid shits.

270
00:28:53,912 --> 00:28:57,177  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Too much mint leaf
in the snails, Rosa.

271
00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:01,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Is that so?
- And not enough peppers.

272
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:04,379  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Taste these, one of
our most popular specialties.

273
00:29:04,456 --> 00:29:07,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll show you how.
Watch carefully.

274
00:29:07,392 --> 00:29:09,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here we are.
Ah, that is good.

275
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:18,496  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One bite of these and you're up
like a shot. Ask your girlfriend.

276
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:28,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I never eat snails in restaurants.

277
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:32,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Only when I cook them myself
because I soak them for four days first.

278
00:29:32,384 --> 00:29:37,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can suck them clean.
Not those.

279
00:29:37,622 --> 00:29:42,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In Rome we say, ''No matter what you eat,
it all turns to shit.''

280
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:46,397  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what you eat tastes like shit.
Excuse me.

281
00:29:47,999 --> 00:29:51,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maryhada little sheep
with the sheep she went to sleep

282
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:54,736  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The sheep turned out to be a ram
Maryhada little lamb

283
00:29:54,806 --> 00:29:58,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where'd she learn those?
Will you listen to that.

284
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Some mother you are,
teaching her that stuff.

285
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,281  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You taught her, not me.

286
00:30:06,351 --> 00:30:08,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you mean me?
I didn't teach her nothing.

287
00:30:08,854 --> 00:30:11,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pinocchio 'snose was long
as long as Pinocchio 's dong

288
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,981  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maestro, give me a ''la.''

289
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,743  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sing this one with me.

290
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:41,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Torquato, bring this guy a drink.

291
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Cough up some money for the orphans.
- We gave last year.

292
00:30:49,561 --> 00:30:53,861  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me that. I'll serve them.
How about this, huh?

293
00:30:53,932 --> 00:30:55,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And you better eat it all.
We don't believe in leftovers.

294
00:30:56,001 --> 00:30:57,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look at that.

295
00:30:58,069 --> 00:30:59,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you keep still!

296
00:33:08,667 --> 00:33:10,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What about the Rome of today?

297
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:13,866  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What impression does it make on the
visitor arriving for the first time?

298
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:16,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As arriving by car from the highway...

299
00:33:16,608 --> 00:33:19,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and taking the inevitable
raccordo anulare...

300
00:33:19,611 --> 00:33:22,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which circles the city
like one of Saturn 's rings.

301
00:33:26,151 --> 00:33:28,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scaratti at quarterback?

302
00:33:29,554 --> 00:33:31,454  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Christ! We'll never win.

303
00:33:31,523 --> 00:33:35,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Five to zero. How do you like that?
- You should've stayed in bed.

304
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where the hell are they going?

305
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:15,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- How long will it take? It's raining.
- We'll be ready in a minute.

306
00:34:16,568 --> 00:34:21,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Tough life, eh, boys?
- Hold on tight.

307
00:35:50,462 --> 00:35:54,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, you motherfuckin' gypsies, we're
gonna stomp the shit out of you today.

308
00:35:54,132 --> 00:35:57,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go get your sister
and we'll bust her cherry for her.

309
00:36:15,086 --> 00:36:18,715  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can you hear me?
Raise the boom as high as you can.

310
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:47,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Move! Move! Move!

311
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:12,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kick the ruling class
out on its ass!

312
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:38,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Tell me what you see.
- Piazza di Siene.

313
00:42:40,204 --> 00:42:44,004  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've got a tourist bus coming.
Shall I follow it?

314
00:42:44,075 --> 00:42:46,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, see if you can.

315
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You want a picture? I take it for you.
- Oh, thanks.

316
00:43:36,527 --> 00:43:39,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You very bella.
Can make a nice picture.

317
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:44,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There. Don't move. Smile.

318
00:43:49,674 --> 00:43:52,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you framing now?

319
00:43:53,044 --> 00:43:58,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Domes and bell tower.
- It's beautiful. I see the whole city.

320
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:01,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The piazzas, the streets,
people on their way to work.

321
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:04,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you see people on their way
to work, it ain't Rome.

322
00:44:04,088 --> 00:44:05,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get lost.

323
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:08,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're up so high
you must be seeing another city.

324
00:44:08,426 --> 00:44:11,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's what they say about Romans,
and here we are sweating blood all day.

325
00:44:11,329 --> 00:44:15,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This isn't Rome anymore. Everyone's
gone crazy. Too much of a hurry.

326
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:19,694  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They've become mean.
The true Romans have disappeared.

327
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't think so?
Just take a look around.

328
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:26,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All you see are filthy hippies,
students who don't want to study...

329
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:29,104  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
transvestites, drug addicts,
trash of all kind.

330
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:32,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, because you're forgetting
this film will be seen abroad.

331
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:37,354  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you show the perverts,
the street whores, negative aspects...

332
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:40,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
what are they going to think
of our lovely Rome?

333
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:42,148  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it?

334
00:44:42,226 --> 00:44:45,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He wanted to ask you
if your film would show of Rome...

335
00:44:45,796 --> 00:44:50,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the important and eternal problems
faced by modern-day society.

336
00:44:50,968 --> 00:44:53,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And we're not only referring to
the problems in the educational system.

337
00:44:53,971 --> 00:44:58,135  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As the working world, with problems
in the factories, in housing.

338
00:44:58,209 --> 00:45:02,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We wouldn't want to see the same old
colorful Rome, easygoing, messy.

339
00:45:02,747 --> 00:45:05,307  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- The usual bland and commercial image.
- That's not the only Rome.

340
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,476  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I think a person
should be true to his own nature.

341
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:15,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Pino, what do you see now?
- The station and a small dome.

342
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:18,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, it must be the dome
of the old Barafonda Theatre.

343
00:45:18,596 --> 00:45:21,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's what l'd like to film,
for example--

344
00:45:21,465 --> 00:45:24,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a variety show
at the Barafonda Theatre...

345
00:45:24,235 --> 00:45:27,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
thirty years ago,
at the beginning of the war.

346
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:11,880  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, shit-face!
You here too, huh?

347
00:46:11,949 --> 00:46:14,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you move your big feet.

348
00:46:14,585 --> 00:46:17,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you say, Spino?
How's it hangin'?

349
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:19,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me a light, will ya?

350
00:46:42,279 --> 00:46:45,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just 'cause you ate some glass
don't mean you're a window.

351
00:46:45,616 --> 00:46:48,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He can't help it.
He's never seen one before.

352
00:46:48,953 --> 00:46:51,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't look too hard.
You might hurt yourself.

353
00:46:54,992 --> 00:46:56,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take 'em away.

354
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Hey, Ciriola, how do you like that?
- Man, she sure is built, huh?

355
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Pericles! Pericles!

356
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:28,356  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Ding-Dong. What do you want?
- Shove that spotlight up your ass.

357
00:47:37,468 --> 00:47:40,164  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here I am, ladies and gentlemen.
Good evening.

358
00:47:40,237 --> 00:47:43,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Most comedians start things off
with a joke or two before their routine.

359
00:47:43,807 --> 00:47:46,105  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, get off the stage.

360
00:47:47,945 --> 00:47:51,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, I don't tell jokes
because I'm not very good at it.

361
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:54,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So if you don't mind I'd like
to present a few of my imitations.

362
00:47:54,985 --> 00:47:58,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After my successful tour of Marino
Roccasecca, Frascati, Zagarolo...

363
00:47:58,689 --> 00:48:01,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was greatly honored
to perform for the royal police force.

364
00:48:04,962 --> 00:48:07,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, shall we begin?

365
00:48:07,798 --> 00:48:10,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The first imitation is that
of a man who has eaten too much.

366
00:48:16,574 --> 00:48:19,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I said get off the stage.

367
00:48:28,219 --> 00:48:31,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the matter, you deaf?
The man said get off.

368
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:35,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Sit down, you big loud mouth.
- Second imitation.

369
00:48:36,627 --> 00:48:39,755  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A young lady having a shower.
Maestro!

370
00:48:44,101 --> 00:48:46,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, do us a big favor
and go away, will ya?

371
00:48:47,004 --> 00:48:48,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah, go away!

372
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:53,468  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why? I've got just as much right
to make a living as everybody, don't I?

373
00:48:53,544 --> 00:48:57,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Just disappear.
- All right, if you don't go, we will.

374
00:49:00,517 --> 00:49:04,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We'll pretend we enjoyed the act
and you pretend it's over. Okay?

375
00:49:07,524 --> 00:49:12,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I'm what's known as ''stilé. ''
- Stilé, achmilé, you stink too.

376
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here you have the modern-day saturnalia,
the variety show.

377
00:49:14,698 --> 00:49:18,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As you can see, it is a combination
of circus maximus and brothel.

378
00:49:18,469 --> 00:49:21,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, if you're going
to start talking dirty, I'm leaving.

379
00:49:21,739 --> 00:49:23,673  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did I say?
I mentioned a brothel.

380
00:49:23,741 --> 00:49:25,038  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Even Proust, in the recherche...

381
00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:27,600  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
gives us a lengthy description
of a house of ill repute.

382
00:49:27,678 --> 00:49:30,340  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, you and your damned Proust.

383
00:49:31,181 --> 00:49:32,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I've got to work
like everyone else.

384
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes. So go out
and find a job.

385
00:49:35,352 --> 00:49:37,445  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Maestro,
strike up the band.

386
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:10,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Boy, is that funny.

387
00:50:16,126 --> 00:50:20,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Will you shut your trap?
You guys are really making me laugh.

388
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:23,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm laughing so much it hurts.

389
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:45,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Goddamn bastards. Won't let decent
people enjoy an evening of theater.

390
00:50:45,656 --> 00:50:48,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- That man's a real artist, lady.
- Get lost.

391
00:50:48,859 --> 00:50:50,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l heard a little noise

392
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,359  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Coming from the audience

393
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:57,559  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get lost!

394
00:50:57,634 --> 00:51:00,068  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen, lady,
what do you want from me?

395
00:51:01,138 --> 00:51:03,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Certain people
shouldn't be allowed in here.

396
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:07,770  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I bought a ticket to enjoy the show.
So just shut up and leave me alone.

397
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:18,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What are you trying to do?
Ruin everybody's evening?

398
00:51:18,288 --> 00:51:20,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you're not having fun,
go home and play with yourself.

399
00:51:20,391 --> 00:51:22,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Kiss my ass.

400
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:50,410  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- There.
- Madam, really!

401
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:52,421  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- He's only human.

402
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're all humans,
but we don't go around doing that.

403
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,626  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's gonna get my purse
right in his face.

404
00:52:10,574 --> 00:52:12,303  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What a son of a bitch.

405
00:52:12,376 --> 00:52:16,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, you ass hole.
I'm gonna bust your head.

406
00:52:16,113 --> 00:52:20,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You nuts or something?
I didn't do it. It wasn't me.

407
00:52:24,354 --> 00:52:28,848  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- I saw you throwing those beans at me.
- Again? I told you it wasn't me.

408
00:52:28,926 --> 00:52:30,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm gonna rip your arms off.
Gonna rip 'em both off.

409
00:52:30,961 --> 00:52:32,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pipe down, baldy.

410
00:52:32,729 --> 00:52:35,926  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Maestro,
see if you can play this.

411
00:52:37,401 --> 00:52:40,734  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Cram it up your ass.
- How about this one?

412
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:44,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Up your mother's too.

413
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:51,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And now for the best part,
everybody. Quiet.

414
00:52:52,015 --> 00:52:53,539  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For the Amateur Hour.

415
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:58,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where'd that big guy go?
The tall one with all those muscles?

416
00:52:58,288 --> 00:53:00,279  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was right here
a minute ago.

417
00:53:00,357 --> 00:53:01,824  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Somebody shrink you?
- No.

418
00:53:01,892 --> 00:53:03,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Born premature?
- Yes.

419
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:06,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you ask me, this guy was born
before he was conceived.

420
00:53:06,363 --> 00:53:07,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's your name?
- Alvaro.

421
00:53:07,798 --> 00:53:09,857  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And what do you do?
- Tap dance.

422
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:12,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Yeah, but what do you do besides that?
- I'm an electrician.

423
00:53:12,836 --> 00:53:15,964  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An electrician. And you learned
how to dance from all those shocks.

424
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:19,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
Alvaro!

425
00:53:20,844 --> 00:53:23,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An imitation of Fred Astaire.

426
00:53:41,865 --> 00:53:43,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Help!

427
00:53:43,634 --> 00:53:45,568  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I feel sick!

428
00:53:45,636 --> 00:53:47,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Help!

429
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:50,906  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I feel sick! Help!

430
00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:55,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Chiodo, it's here.

431
00:53:56,179 --> 00:53:59,740  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here it is. Here it is.

432
00:53:59,816 --> 00:54:02,011  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Give me it. Give it here.

433
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:06,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let me have it. Go on.

434
00:54:12,029 --> 00:54:15,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Make yourself a fur coat,
Fred Astaire.

435
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:26,400  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's what you had for dinner, huh?
Double-time, Maestro.

436
00:54:42,993 --> 00:54:46,053  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you'd thrown it at me,
you would have eaten it for sure.

437
00:54:46,129 --> 00:54:49,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Your father's mustache!
- At least he wasn't queer like yours.

438
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:52,892  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Same to you.
I'll take care of you later.

439
00:54:52,970 --> 00:54:54,904  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come here, honey.
Come over here.

440
00:54:55,973 --> 00:54:58,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's your name?
- Loredana Fiorini.

441
00:54:58,141 --> 00:55:00,666  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And what are you gonna sing?
- ''You Stole My Heart.''

442
00:55:00,744 --> 00:55:04,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''You Stole My Heart.''
Wiseass.

443
00:55:04,247 --> 00:55:08,980  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get back in the toilet,
you big piece of shit.

444
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:22,093  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You have a match, young man? I really
don't know why they let her sing.

445
00:55:22,165 --> 00:55:24,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wouldn't you be better off at home,
doing the dishes, girlie?

446
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:27,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

447
00:55:27,437 --> 00:55:30,531  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whatever happened to talent?

448
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:33,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I feel sorry
for the poor girl.

449
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:40,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hope I didn't disturb you.

450
00:56:01,505 --> 00:56:03,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- We'd like to talk to you for a minute.
- What do you wanna talk to me for?

451
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:04,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Just for two minutes.

452
00:56:05,075 --> 00:56:07,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must have me mixed up
with someone else.

453
00:56:07,944 --> 00:56:10,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I didn't do nothing.
You're making a big mistake.

454
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:11,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go on. Move.

455
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:36,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ladies and gentlemen,
the three Kants.

456
00:56:36,995 --> 00:56:41,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I said Kant and not what your
dirty minds are probably thinking.

457
00:57:09,828 --> 00:57:12,092  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Trotta Cavallino''!

458
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,311  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shut up!

459
00:57:36,154 --> 00:57:38,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'd like to hear
''Trotta Cavallino''?

460
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:41,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I like it.
It's a nice song, right?

461
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:22,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Orestes, gimme a hand.

462
00:58:49,094 --> 00:58:51,927  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your attention, please, everybody.

463
00:58:51,997 --> 00:58:56,627  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Attention! We interrupt the show
to give you some good news.

464
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
After all,
our country comes first!

465
00:58:58,403 --> 00:59:01,031  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The radio just broadcast
the following war bulletin...

466
00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:03,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which I'm proud to read to you.

467
00:59:04,609 --> 00:59:08,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''The attack on Sicily
the enemy began last night...

468
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:12,277  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
backed by heavy naval and air support
to include paratroopers...

469
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:16,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
has received a setback
from our allied forces...

470
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:18,850  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
fighting in southeastern Italy.

471
00:59:18,924 --> 00:59:25,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
German artillery have downed seven
aircraft and damaged three steamships.

472
00:59:25,297 --> 00:59:28,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This treacherous attack against our
country's sacred soil will be crushed...

473
00:59:28,466 --> 00:59:30,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the enemy thrown into the sea.

474
00:59:30,268 --> 00:59:33,726  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For the greater glory
of our fatherland and its Duce.''

475
00:59:33,805 --> 00:59:35,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Long live Italy!

476
01:01:05,497 --> 01:01:06,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, baby! Baby!

477
01:01:06,931 --> 01:01:11,459  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where have you been all my life?

478
01:01:12,837 --> 01:01:15,169  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, that's enough outta you.
Now sit down!

479
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I help it if I like women?

480
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:20,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watch out how you talk
to my father!

481
01:01:20,312 --> 01:01:24,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- It'd sit down if I was you!
- There it is!

482
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:41,894  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm in love with you, angel eyes,
you and your cute little ass!

483
01:01:46,271 --> 01:01:48,569  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, isn't that the siren?

484
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's an air raid!

485
01:01:52,344 --> 01:01:55,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's an air raid!

486
01:01:59,217 --> 01:02:03,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The audience is requested
to go to the air raid shelter...

487
01:02:03,888 --> 01:02:07,051  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
at number 104, 104.

488
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:10,686  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whose kid is this?
Who gave me this little boy?

489
01:02:10,762 --> 01:02:13,663  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please keep calm.
Please keep calm.

490
01:02:13,732 --> 01:02:16,394  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Romolo! The chorus girls!

491
01:02:16,468 --> 01:02:18,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Over here! Over here!

492
01:02:36,020 --> 01:02:37,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn out that light!

493
01:02:56,374 --> 01:02:57,898  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What time is it?

494
01:02:58,977 --> 01:03:02,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There I was, sound asleep,
if it wasn't for that idiot.

495
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:05,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me. What did you say?
''If it wasn't for that idiot''?

496
01:03:05,517 --> 01:03:07,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did I say? I don't know.

497
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,749  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Speak up.
What did you mean by that?

498
01:03:09,821 --> 01:03:13,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- He didn't mean anything by it.
- I didn't mean anything.

499
01:03:13,158 --> 01:03:15,217  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's unforgivable!

500
01:03:15,293 --> 01:03:17,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Certain people ought
to be ashamed of themselves.

501
01:03:18,062 --> 01:03:21,759  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Especially now, with our country
united as never before...

502
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:24,961  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
on the verge of victory,
and you still hear defeatist remarks!

503
01:03:25,036 --> 01:03:27,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shame on you!

504
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:32,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Fascist Italy. The Duce.

505
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:35,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're your only hope.

506
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And we must win.
- Yes.

507
01:03:37,182 --> 01:03:39,116  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- And we will win.
- Right.

508
01:03:44,255 --> 01:03:47,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You want a cigarette?

509
01:03:47,225 --> 01:03:49,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Smoke ruin my voice.
No very good.

510
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:51,986  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Oh, you sing?
- Yes.

511
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:54,293  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I learn in my city, Dusseldorf.

512
01:03:54,365 --> 01:03:55,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Have you been in Italy long?

513
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:59,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I been to Roma,
Milano, Bergamo, Como.

514
01:03:59,771 --> 01:04:02,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This Hans, oldest son.

515
01:04:02,474 --> 01:04:03,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do you want?

516
01:04:04,709 --> 01:04:08,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is my husband in Russia,
Wehrmacht.

517
01:04:44,182 --> 01:04:46,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You come rest a little with me?

518
01:04:47,018 --> 01:04:49,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My boardinghouse is very near.

519
01:04:49,354 --> 01:04:53,085  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They won't bomb us
as long as the Pope's in Rome.

520
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:55,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good night, Anita.

521
01:04:55,193 --> 01:04:57,184  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Might as well say good morning.

522
01:04:57,262 --> 01:05:00,231  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's that booming?
- My God, do you hear that?

523
01:05:00,298 --> 01:05:02,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mother of God! They're bombs!

524
01:05:04,168 --> 01:05:06,136  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Help! Help!

525
01:05:10,542 --> 01:05:12,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're being bombed!

526
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:15,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Help!

527
01:05:15,146 --> 01:05:19,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Alberto's house is gone!
The babies! The babies!

528
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Help! Help!

529
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:05,523  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can I shoot a bit of it?

530
01:06:05,591 --> 01:06:07,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go ahead, if you like.

531
01:06:08,594 --> 01:06:11,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A perfectly preserved mammoth's tusk.

532
01:06:11,497 --> 01:06:14,728  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We discovered it during construction
of the Piazza Re di Roma station.

533
01:06:14,801 --> 01:06:16,735  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Capitoline Museum
has already asked for it.

534
01:06:16,803 --> 01:06:19,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shall we go down?
This way, please.

535
01:06:42,028 --> 01:06:43,154  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What was that?

536
01:07:03,383 --> 01:07:06,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The ground beneath Rome
is unpredictable.

537
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:10,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Every hundred meters,
we come across some important find.

538
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:17,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Naturally, this slows up the work.

539
01:07:17,397 --> 01:07:19,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is a very diffiicult contract.

540
01:07:19,932 --> 01:07:23,800  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We merely wanted to resolve
the traffiic problem...

541
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:27,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with a subway
like Munich's or Dublin's...

542
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:30,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but here the ground
has eight strata...

543
01:07:30,476 --> 01:07:34,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and we're forced
to become archaeologists.

544
01:07:36,082 --> 01:07:40,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The first time the necessity
ofa subway for Rome...

545
01:07:40,686 --> 01:07:43,018  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was discussed was in 1871 .

546
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:45,489  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- You mean 1971 .
- No, exactly a hundred years ago.

547
01:07:46,692 --> 01:07:50,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Roman bureaucracy is even more
unpredictable than Roman soil.

548
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:53,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The paperwork which has passed
between ourselves...

549
01:07:53,533 --> 01:07:56,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and the community of Rome is enough
to fill the entire length of subway.

550
01:07:56,502 --> 01:07:59,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right now we're passing
beneath the Appio Quarter.

551
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:04,100  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Agenore!
Agenore, what's that?

552
01:08:04,177 --> 01:08:06,304  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My God, it's an earthquake!

553
01:08:09,649 --> 01:08:14,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Agenore!
Oh, my God! My God!

554
01:08:24,597 --> 01:08:26,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The buildings overhead
began to crack.

555
01:08:27,834 --> 01:08:30,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Mike, I'll get
a shot like this. Look.

556
01:08:37,343 --> 01:08:39,504  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are we now?

557
01:08:39,579 --> 01:08:43,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Beneath the Appia Antica,
near San Sebastiano Gate.

558
01:08:43,916 --> 01:08:47,875  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To your left you can hear the roar
of a genuine underground river.

559
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:50,422  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It emerges about
ten kilometers from here...

560
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:53,220  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
at a place called ''Cessati Spiriti.''

561
01:09:03,302 --> 01:09:06,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When will the whole thing
be completed?

562
01:09:06,939 --> 01:09:08,634  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

563
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:33,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How many hours
do they work down here?

564
01:09:33,432 --> 01:09:35,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ten hours straight, I think.

565
01:09:44,010 --> 01:09:47,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
At this point,
we had to change course again.

566
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:51,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
On the left you can see
a necropolis with 400 skeletons.

567
01:09:51,450 --> 01:09:52,712  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Third strata.

568
01:10:22,982 --> 01:10:24,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Track 22!

569
01:10:26,786 --> 01:10:30,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Rinaldo, the current
in the right channel has gone down!

570
01:10:30,856 --> 01:10:32,289  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop!

571
01:10:33,693 --> 01:10:35,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Stop!

572
01:10:38,164 --> 01:10:42,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sir, I think we've run
into another hollow spot.

573
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:44,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's been showing on the gauge
for two days.

574
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:00,778  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've got to suspend
the work again, sir.

575
01:11:00,853 --> 01:11:03,481  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's happened?
- Come have a look at the gauge.

576
01:11:18,871 --> 01:11:21,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take the flame cutter
to number three.

577
01:11:31,817 --> 01:11:35,810  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We've got a hollow spot
as big as the Alban Hills!

578
01:11:39,191 --> 01:11:41,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What is it, Amirildo?
Don't you feel well?

579
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:43,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know what it is.

580
01:11:50,336 --> 01:11:53,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ragu, the right wheel!

581
01:11:53,406 --> 01:11:55,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The right wheel, Ragu!

582
01:11:55,708 --> 01:12:00,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Stop the drill!

583
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It goes like this. Now we know there
is an open space on the other side.

584
01:12:55,101 --> 01:12:58,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The archaeologists will make us
suspend work for a couple of months.

585
01:12:58,370 --> 01:13:01,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It could be a cavern
or some catacombs.

586
01:13:01,340 --> 01:13:05,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We could try testing the wall
very carefully in different spots.

587
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:07,945  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Start up the cutter.

588
01:14:23,189 --> 01:14:25,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Stop the cutter.
- Stop the cutter!

589
01:14:39,738 --> 01:14:42,571  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Down this way. Sir.

590
01:14:47,146 --> 01:14:49,580  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A Roman house...

591
01:14:49,648 --> 01:14:51,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
from 2,000 years ago.

592
01:16:25,911 --> 01:16:27,845  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michael, look at their faces.

593
01:16:27,913 --> 01:16:29,744  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Keep your mask on.

594
01:16:40,492 --> 01:16:42,426  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's as if they were staring at us.

595
01:16:58,711 --> 01:17:01,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look! Aim the light down there!

596
01:17:03,415 --> 01:17:04,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There!

597
01:17:12,725 --> 01:17:16,320  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey! Look at this!
What's happening?

598
01:17:22,468 --> 01:17:25,665  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The frescoes are fading.

599
01:17:25,738 --> 01:17:28,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's the air from outside.

600
01:17:30,943 --> 01:17:32,934  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The fresh air
is destroying the frescoes.

601
01:17:33,746 --> 01:17:37,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, no! How awful!

602
01:17:40,953 --> 01:17:45,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Michael! What can we do?
We've got to do something.

603
01:17:48,427 --> 01:17:50,361  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do something!

604
01:19:08,307 --> 01:19:13,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For these disenchanted youngsters,
huddled together like puppies...

605
01:19:13,779 --> 01:19:15,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
making love is not a problem.

606
01:19:15,714 --> 01:19:17,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe they do it,
maybe they don't.

607
01:19:17,716 --> 01:19:21,049  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But it certainly isn 't as complicated
as it once was for us...

608
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:25,420  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when our amorous yearning
led us to the nearest brothel.

609
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:27,791  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remember?

610
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:52,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, move!

611
01:20:24,383 --> 01:20:27,409  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, no fuckin' around,
you lousy bums!

612
01:20:27,486 --> 01:20:31,582  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You act like you just got outta jail.
Go lay your grandmother!

613
01:20:31,657 --> 01:20:34,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where you goin'? How old are you?
Let me see your identifiication.

614
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:54,179  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go! Move it! Upstairs!

615
01:20:54,246 --> 01:20:57,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, who's gonna be first?

616
01:21:02,621 --> 01:21:05,681  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on! Come on! Can't you see
the tongue she's got on her?

617
01:21:08,193 --> 01:21:11,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, boys, make up your minds!
You too, Gramps.

618
01:21:11,096 --> 01:21:13,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the matter?
You all asleep on your feet?

619
01:21:16,435 --> 01:21:19,370  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right! Enough of this shit!

620
01:21:19,438 --> 01:21:22,805  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Pretty soon I'm gonna turn off
the lights and kick everyone out!

621
01:21:22,874 --> 01:21:26,139  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You got blood in your veins
or water?

622
01:21:27,412 --> 01:21:30,245  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Every one of these girls is an artist.
You guys blind?

623
01:21:30,315 --> 01:21:34,411  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Now get your asses upstairs.
- All right, let me by. Let me by.

624
01:21:39,424 --> 01:21:42,257  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go upstairs, dolls.
Come on.

625
01:21:42,327 --> 01:21:45,558  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, boys.
The young ladies are all here.

626
01:21:45,631 --> 01:21:48,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Teresa!
Where the hell's my coffee?

627
01:21:48,467 --> 01:21:51,561  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's coming.
I already ordered it.

628
01:21:53,839 --> 01:21:57,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You wanna come with me, yes or no?
Come on, come on, soldier boy.

629
01:21:57,342 --> 01:22:01,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't want to sleep by myself.
I don't want to sleep by myself.

630
01:22:05,083 --> 01:22:07,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Rita, turn around.

631
01:22:07,586 --> 01:22:10,214  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I won't take you even if you
give me food for a month.

632
01:22:10,289 --> 01:22:13,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't you
go take the next train...

633
01:22:13,525 --> 01:22:15,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
back to Naples, fuck face?

634
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:18,294  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, honey!

635
01:22:18,363 --> 01:22:20,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you wanna stand there and jack off,
then go home and do it.

636
01:22:25,937 --> 01:22:28,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What kind of men are you?

637
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:30,835  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you keep waitin',
it's gonna drop off from old age...

638
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:33,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and not even the cat
will eat it then.

639
01:22:33,312 --> 01:22:35,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's closing time.

640
01:22:35,547 --> 01:22:38,380  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're all pretty
and they're real artists!

641
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:43,046  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Is Dolores back?
- She went to have a bite to eat.

642
01:22:43,121 --> 01:22:45,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who's gonna come upstairs
with the pride of Florence?

643
01:22:45,157 --> 01:22:47,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's a good boy.

644
01:22:48,193 --> 01:22:50,821  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look! Those tits
must weigh 40 pounds each.

645
01:22:50,896 --> 01:22:52,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shut your fuckin' trap!

646
01:22:58,770 --> 01:23:01,238  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's an ugly, skinny bitch like you
doin' in a nice place like this?

647
01:23:01,306 --> 01:23:03,774  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So why'd you go upstairs, then?
Just to make fun of a working girl?

648
01:23:03,842 --> 01:23:06,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Two.
- I got a good mind to call the cops.

649
01:23:09,147 --> 01:23:12,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll throw you down the stairs
three at a time, you bastards.

650
01:23:31,703 --> 01:23:35,662  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on!
Come on. Come on. Come on.

651
01:23:42,481 --> 01:23:45,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There she goes again. Every time
it rains, she gets hysterical.

652
01:23:47,386 --> 01:23:52,483  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Marcella. Watch out for her nails.
- All right. Who's my next victim?

653
01:23:52,557 --> 01:23:54,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You thieving bitch.

654
01:23:54,559 --> 01:23:57,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nives, calm down.
Wanna come upstairs, handsome?

655
01:24:00,932 --> 01:24:04,163  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's go. Let's go.

656
01:24:07,606 --> 01:24:11,599  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shut up. Tonight
you can pack up and get out.

657
01:24:12,778 --> 01:24:14,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Two monkeys!

658
01:24:19,951 --> 01:24:22,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Let the lady by!
- What is this shit?

659
01:24:23,021 --> 01:24:25,455  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You think you're a goddamn cop?
Don't shove me around.

660
01:24:25,524 --> 01:24:27,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ladies, up to your rooms, please.

661
01:24:27,626 --> 01:24:30,618  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, gentlemen.
Everybody out, please. Out.

662
01:24:30,695 --> 01:24:32,993  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The ladies are going to eat.

663
01:24:33,064 --> 01:24:34,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're closing.

664
01:24:34,966 --> 01:24:36,900  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Turn off the lights.
We're closed.

665
01:24:36,968 --> 01:24:39,493  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go get some fresh air.
We're closed. Everybody out.

666
01:24:41,873 --> 01:24:43,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right! Time to go home.

667
01:24:43,875 --> 01:24:48,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everybody out.
Time to go home!

668
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:53,910  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All right, buster! Cut it out.
I'm not your sister.

669
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:05,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who knows why, why we live

670
01:25:05,630 --> 01:25:11,865  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And why the fuck we die

671
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:16,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But there were also
some very sophisticated houses...

672
01:25:16,508 --> 01:25:19,443  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which would make your heart beat
in fear and excitement.

673
01:25:37,195 --> 01:25:39,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sit down, sit down.

674
01:26:02,954 --> 01:26:07,914  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's the matter? What's everybody
so quiet about? This'll never do.

675
01:26:07,993 --> 01:26:10,928  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, who wants to come up
to my room for a game of chess?

676
01:26:12,731 --> 01:26:15,097  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How are you, honey?
Don't you love me today?

677
01:26:18,403 --> 01:26:22,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This morning I woke up real horny.
Gentlemen, who's gonna be first?

678
01:26:25,911 --> 01:26:27,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here I am.

679
01:26:27,412 --> 01:26:30,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't wait to get back to my room.
Let's not waste any time.

680
01:26:33,518 --> 01:26:35,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on!

681
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on!

682
01:26:37,055 --> 01:26:40,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Babies, you afraid of mama?
- Last chance, fellas.

683
01:26:40,158 --> 01:26:44,652  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going. I'm going up to bed.
Last chance, fellas.

684
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:48,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm all on fire!
I'm all on fire!

685
01:26:52,070 --> 01:26:54,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where the hell do you think you are?
It's not your home.

686
01:26:54,539 --> 01:26:57,702  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All I want is one good man.

687
01:26:57,776 --> 01:27:01,803  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on! I'm Spanish and hot.

688
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:03,814  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, men, move it!

689
01:27:10,288 --> 01:27:11,482  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on!

690
01:27:11,556 --> 01:27:12,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on!

691
01:27:14,426 --> 01:27:16,656  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, my babies, shame on you!

692
01:27:16,728 --> 01:27:21,893  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who nailed your feet to the floor?
Dad! See if I got something in my eye.

693
01:27:21,967 --> 01:27:25,300  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's my nice little sailor?
Who's gonna ride my ship?

694
01:27:25,370 --> 01:27:28,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's my nice little sailor?

695
01:27:56,768 --> 01:28:00,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm so excited,
I can't even think straight!

696
01:28:00,171 --> 01:28:02,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take anyone you want.
Come on and quit pretending.

697
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:05,499  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've seen you here before, stupid.

698
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:10,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gentlemen, shame on you for keeping
all these beautiful ladies waiting.

699
01:28:11,049 --> 01:28:13,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All clear! All clear!

700
01:28:22,060 --> 01:28:23,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But I have to leave.

701
01:28:23,328 --> 01:28:27,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, you don't, not yet.
I'm not losin' my job on account of you.

702
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:29,132  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Damn it! Some big wheel, I bet.

703
01:28:30,568 --> 01:28:33,435  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gentlemen,
please remain where you are...

704
01:28:33,505 --> 01:28:35,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and don't leave the room
for the next five minutes.

705
01:28:35,674 --> 01:28:36,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you.

706
01:28:41,079 --> 01:28:42,512  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I see.

707
01:28:43,915 --> 01:28:47,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ladies, upstairs
to your rooms, please.

708
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:53,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hurry up, please. Thank you.

709
01:28:53,692 --> 01:28:57,219  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Who's arrived, the mayor?
- Who knows? Maybe it is.

710
01:28:57,295 --> 01:28:59,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe so, l don't know

711
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:02,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l don't know, maybe so

712
01:29:16,314 --> 01:29:20,216  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Experience, my dear.
That's what counts in life.

713
01:29:20,285 --> 01:29:24,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If your son's experienced,
he'll never have any problems.

714
01:29:24,589 --> 01:29:28,150  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I think that dark guy wants you.

715
01:29:28,226 --> 01:29:30,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But if he's not experienced...

716
01:29:30,361 --> 01:29:34,525  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
all he'll get
is a royal screwing, right?

717
01:29:34,599 --> 01:29:37,625  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's so true.
Dolores is always right.

718
01:29:37,702 --> 01:29:39,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not always, no.

719
01:30:03,528 --> 01:30:05,792  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You are very beautiful, you know.

720
01:30:07,132 --> 01:30:08,793  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where are you from?

721
01:30:08,867 --> 01:30:10,357  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Santa Maria la Bruna.

722
01:30:10,435 --> 01:30:13,302  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Where's that?
- Near Pompeii.

723
01:30:13,371 --> 01:30:16,636  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Is that your son?
- Yes, that's my son.

724
01:30:20,512 --> 01:30:23,276  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But you-- How long have you--

725
01:30:23,348 --> 01:30:25,339  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Two years.

726
01:30:26,384 --> 01:30:30,218  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen-- I mean,
how did you happen to--

727
01:30:30,288 --> 01:30:31,653  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What the hell.

728
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:34,521  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I found myself alone,
and Assuntina said, ''Come with us.

729
01:30:34,592 --> 01:30:36,924  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You'll like it, you'll see.
I'll introduce you.''

730
01:30:36,995 --> 01:30:38,929  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lace me up?

731
01:30:40,932 --> 01:30:42,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To tell the truth,
I can't complain.

732
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:45,765  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The signora likes me
and I've got everything I need.

733
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:52,439  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Does that mean you wouldn't
want to leave this place?

734
01:30:52,510 --> 01:30:54,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To do what?

735
01:30:54,746 --> 01:30:58,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haven't you ever fallen in love?
Haven't you ever met someone--

736
01:30:58,416 --> 01:31:01,544  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sure I have.
And this is the result.

737
01:31:02,987 --> 01:31:05,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Listen. Couldn't we
see each other sometime?

738
01:31:05,990 --> 01:31:07,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Do you ever go out?

739
01:31:08,026 --> 01:31:10,358  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Some morning, whenever you want...

740
01:31:10,428 --> 01:31:13,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
we could go to the beach for lunch.

741
01:31:15,166 --> 01:31:18,624  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Really, I'd like to take you out.

742
01:31:18,703 --> 01:31:19,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's make a date.

743
01:31:21,239 --> 01:31:24,868  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tomorrow, okay?
Day after tomorrow?

744
01:31:33,051 --> 01:31:36,316  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Perhaps you have heard
of Princess Domitilla.

745
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,249  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her mother Fabiola,
herg randfather Eugenio...

746
01:31:39,324 --> 01:31:41,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and herancestors further back...

747
01:31:41,392 --> 01:31:44,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
were all born in this palazzo...

748
01:31:44,662 --> 01:31:46,596  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
where todayDomitilla livesalone.

749
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:35,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Salvatore! Domenico!

750
01:32:36,214 --> 01:32:38,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can't you hear the carriage?
He's arrived.

751
01:32:39,951 --> 01:32:41,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Go.

752
01:32:53,665 --> 01:32:54,962  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
At last.

753
01:33:08,479 --> 01:33:12,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your Eminence! Thank you.
Thank you so much.

754
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:15,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Princess Domitilla!
There. There.

755
01:33:15,386 --> 01:33:18,446  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How nice it is
to see you all again.

756
01:33:19,991 --> 01:33:21,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good evening.

757
01:33:21,993 --> 01:33:25,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hope you are all well,
with the grace of God.

758
01:33:28,967 --> 01:33:30,901  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must be Francesca, right?

759
01:33:30,969 --> 01:33:32,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yes, I'm Francesca,
Your Eminence.

760
01:33:34,439 --> 01:33:36,566  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ah, my eyes
aren't what they used to be.

761
01:33:36,641 --> 01:33:38,871  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And is this little rascal
still causing his mother trouble?

762
01:33:38,943 --> 01:33:41,275  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's not true.
How can you say that?

763
01:33:41,346 --> 01:33:44,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But of course, I was only joking.
Well, isn't it little Filippo!

764
01:33:44,549 --> 01:33:48,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Remember when you used to drink
the wine out of the ampullae?

765
01:33:48,553 --> 01:33:52,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And who are these little devils?
Augustarello's children, eh?

766
01:33:52,156 --> 01:33:55,023  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How do you do? We already met.

767
01:33:55,093 --> 01:33:57,186  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I gave you your first Communion.

768
01:33:57,261 --> 01:33:59,195  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This little blond boy
I've never seen.

769
01:33:59,263 --> 01:34:00,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What's your name?
- Giulio.

770
01:34:00,932 --> 01:34:04,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Are you good?
I bet only when you're asleep.

771
01:34:05,737 --> 01:34:08,103  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And now off to bed, eh?

772
01:34:08,172 --> 01:34:11,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good night, children,
and God bless you.

773
01:34:11,409 --> 01:34:12,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good night, Your Eminence.

774
01:34:12,777 --> 01:34:15,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If Your Eminence
will come this way.

775
01:34:15,413 --> 01:34:17,881  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My friends! Please sit down.

776
01:34:17,949 --> 01:34:22,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ah, yes, why, even today
there was an audience with people...

777
01:34:22,086 --> 01:34:25,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
who want to tell the Pope
how to run the church.

778
01:34:27,225 --> 01:34:29,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What can you do?
Be patient, I suppose.

779
01:34:29,627 --> 01:34:32,187  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Fire's for burning
and patience for learning''...

780
01:34:32,263 --> 01:34:33,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as we say in Rome.

781
01:34:40,571 --> 01:34:44,701  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I remember your grandfather.
He was a good man, Don Eugenio.

782
01:34:46,277 --> 01:34:50,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My compliments.

783
01:34:50,114 --> 01:34:51,843  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please! Please!

784
01:34:51,916 --> 01:34:53,349  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
My friends.

785
01:34:53,418 --> 01:34:55,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.

786
01:35:00,124 --> 01:35:03,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Peppino, Gervasio,
you may begin serving.

787
01:35:03,728 --> 01:35:05,923  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ah, you've finally arrived!

788
01:35:05,997 --> 01:35:07,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What would you like,
Your Eminence?

789
01:35:07,665 --> 01:35:11,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- A mint to freshen my mouth, thank you.
- Ah, a mint. I knew it.

790
01:35:11,969 --> 01:35:13,903  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here we are.

791
01:35:17,408 --> 01:35:19,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Your Excellency.
- Why not?

792
01:35:19,410 --> 01:35:21,344  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thank you. I'd love one.

793
01:35:21,412 --> 01:35:23,607  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What would you like, Monsignor?
- Monsignor!

794
01:35:23,681 --> 01:35:28,448  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I must tell you that when I was little,
I was quite a mischief maker.

795
01:35:28,519 --> 01:35:30,009  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What did he say?

796
01:35:30,088 --> 01:35:31,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He said when he was young,
he was a rascal.

797
01:35:31,622 --> 01:35:34,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mama used to make a liqueur
just like this for the guests...

798
01:35:34,892 --> 01:35:38,453  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and she would have
to hide it from me.

799
01:35:38,529 --> 01:35:43,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The minute she wasn't there, I'd climb
up and drink it out of the bottle.

800
01:35:45,303 --> 01:35:47,237  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your Eminence, I can't believe it.

801
01:35:47,305 --> 01:35:49,796  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sure that even as a baby,
you were a saint.

802
01:35:52,043 --> 01:35:54,739  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A long life to His Eminence.

803
01:36:03,988 --> 01:36:06,388  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How much time has passed.

804
01:36:06,457 --> 01:36:09,654  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything seems so faraway,
so different.

805
01:36:09,727 --> 01:36:13,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
l'm sorry to leave this life
in a city which is no longer home.

806
01:36:13,898 --> 01:36:16,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Rome l knew was different.

807
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:19,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
People were nicer, more respectful.

808
01:36:19,570 --> 01:36:21,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everyone knew everyone else.

809
01:36:21,606 --> 01:36:24,598  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Monsignors, cardinals, the Pope.

810
01:36:24,675 --> 01:36:27,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They were all either friends
or relatives.

811
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:33,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Friendship with the church
has been lost.

812
01:36:33,918 --> 01:36:36,785  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The marvelous balls...

813
01:36:36,854 --> 01:36:39,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in villas and palazzos...

814
01:36:40,591 --> 01:36:44,960  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with all those cardinals dressed in red
wandering about the house.

815
01:36:45,029 --> 01:36:50,296  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was like living in a painting
and at Christmas.

816
01:36:50,368 --> 01:36:53,496  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Now, why should I
suddenly remember that?

817
01:36:53,571 --> 01:36:56,039  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The little presents
Monsignor Altieri would give me.

818
01:36:56,107 --> 01:36:58,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wax statuettes...

819
01:36:58,109 --> 01:37:03,172  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
crosses out of woven straw
and a lot of velvet for the toymanger.

820
01:37:03,247 --> 01:37:05,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And all of it gone,
lost over the years.

821
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:09,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who knows where all those
little wax statues have gone?

822
01:37:29,273 --> 01:37:32,265  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The following presentation
of ecclesiastical fashions.

823
01:37:32,343 --> 01:37:35,779  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Welcome His Eminence
and our other illustrious guests.

824
01:38:26,530 --> 01:38:28,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Model No. 1 :

825
01:38:28,232 --> 01:38:31,827  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
habit in black satin,
along traditional lines, for novices.

826
01:38:36,073 --> 01:38:40,442  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The same model may be done
in another type of fabric...

827
01:38:40,511 --> 01:38:43,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
such as silk or wool,
according to the season.

828
01:38:43,814 --> 01:38:47,079  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The boots are in leather and suede
in two colors.

829

839
01:41:43,794 --> 01:41:47,992  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The sacerdotal vestments
have passed through evolution:

843
01:41:57,007 --> 01:41:59,942  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in the most brilliant colors,
which don't fade.

844
01:45:57,448 --> 01:45:59,075  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's come back!

845
01:45:59,149 --> 01:46:02,516  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's with us once again.

Don't ever leave us!

847
01:46:15,999 --> 01:46:18,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come back, come back.

848
01:47:18,996 --> 01:47:21,123  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One, two...

849
01:47:21,198 --> 01:47:23,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
three, go!

850

Balloons! Balloons!
All colors and shapes.

851
01:47:56,166 --> 01:47:58,794  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
First he has a drink
before he eats an egg...

852
01:47:58,869 --> 01:48:01,463  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
then he has a drink
while he's eating the egg...

853
01:48:01,538 --> 01:48:03,972  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and now he wants a drink
because he's eaten an egg!

854
01:48:04,041 --> 01:48:05,372  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Jesus!

855
01:48:05,442 --> 01:48:07,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Won't he get sick
from all those eggs?

856

857
01:48:20,424 --> 01:48:23,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- What the hell do you want?
- Go on, it's red!

858
01:48:25,295 --> 01:48:28,230  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're makin' their movie
all over the place...

859
01:48:28,298 --> 01:48:30,232  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but not paying anybody.

860
01:48:34,338 --> 01:48:38,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This pork's from genuine Ariccia pig!
How 'bout a slice?

861
01:48:38,809 --> 01:48:42,973  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Rooky'' here! ''Rooky'' here!
''Leal'' silk! ''Pletty sirk scalf!''

862
01:48:43,046 --> 01:48:45,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
''Pletty sirk scalf.''

863
01:48:45,282 --> 01:48:47,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Brit, they sell
pork sandwiches in Germany?

864
01:48:57,094 --> 01:49:01,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aw, leave Grandpa alone!
Let him sleep. Why bring him along?

865
01:49:13,844 --> 01:49:17,143  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, Torquato! Some gasoline!

866
01:49:17,214 --> 01:49:18,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gasoline.

867
01:49:26,123 --> 01:49:29,183  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Antique paintings.
Fancy frames!

868
01:49:30,827 --> 01:49:32,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Very cheap!

869
01:49:32,896 --> 01:49:35,922  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm going back to the cemetery tomorrow.
Wanna come?

870
01:49:35,999 --> 01:49:38,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They gave him a nice spot, you know.
Really sunny!

871
01:49:56,687 --> 01:49:59,019  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, deadheads! Where you going?

872
01:49:59,089 --> 01:50:01,080  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don't you come here and eat?

873
01:50:01,158 --> 01:50:04,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hey, shorty,
where you gonna feed her?

874
01:50:04,328 --> 01:50:08,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your wife! Well, come on over then
and buy her a decent meal for a change.

875
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:42,492  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Checco! It stinks
like hell over here!

876
01:50:42,566 --> 01:50:46,161  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Did you have to give us a table
next to the manhole?

877
01:50:46,236 --> 01:50:49,000  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's not true! That's the smell
of history, honey, centuries.

878
01:50:49,072 --> 01:50:52,098  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You shit! You shit!
I'll slit your belly open.

879
01:50:52,175 --> 01:50:56,043  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You always believe everything
that dumb bitch tells you?

880
01:50:59,990 --> 01:51:03,619  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There! It's Gore Vidal,
the American writer. Let's ask him.

881
01:51:03,694 --> 01:51:05,286  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Good evening, Mr. Vidal.

882
01:51:05,362 --> 01:51:07,887  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mind if we disturb you
for just two minutes?

883
01:51:11,168 --> 01:51:16,572  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, you ask me why an American writer
would want to live in Rome.

884
01:51:16,640 --> 01:51:19,074  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
First of all,
because I like the Romans.

885
01:51:19,143 --> 01:51:21,976  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They don't give a damn
whether you're dead or alive.

886
01:51:22,045 --> 01:51:24,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They're neutral, like the cats!

887
01:51:24,648 --> 01:51:26,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Rome is the city of illusions.

888
01:51:26,984 --> 01:51:30,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not only by chance, you have here
the church, the government, the cinema.

889
01:51:30,687 --> 01:51:33,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They each produce illusions...

890
01:51:33,824 --> 01:51:36,156  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
like you do and like I do.

891
01:51:36,226 --> 01:51:39,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're getting closer and closer
to the end ofthe world...

892
01:51:39,496 --> 01:51:42,192  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
because of too many people.

893
01:51:42,266 --> 01:51:44,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Too many cars, poisons.

894
01:51:44,768 --> 01:51:48,932  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what better city than Rome,
which has been reborn so often?

895
01:51:49,006 --> 01:51:51,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What place could be more peaceful...

896
01:51:51,275 --> 01:51:55,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to wait for the end
from pollution and overpopulation?

897
01:51:55,078 --> 01:51:58,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's the ideal city for waiting to see
if it will really come to an end or not.

898
01:51:58,982 --> 01:52:00,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To the end!

899
01:52:19,036 --> 01:52:21,402  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Get out! Clear the piazza!

900
01:52:21,472 --> 01:52:23,406  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why?
We weren't bothering anybody!

901
01:52:23,474 --> 01:52:25,635  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hurry up! Move! Move! Move!

902
01:52:32,149 --> 01:52:34,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
If you don't mind,
I would like to say this:

903
01:52:34,651 --> 01:52:38,644  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Despite the recent
and incredibly permissive laws...

904
01:52:38,722 --> 01:52:41,919  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
which protect the guilty man
more than the innocent...

905
01:52:41,992 --> 01:52:45,587  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the restraining measures of
our police force are successful...

906
01:52:45,662 --> 01:52:49,189  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in keeping at an acceptable minimum
the outbreak of delinquency...

907
01:52:49,266 --> 01:52:52,997  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in a city, or in a society,
where protest movements, drugs...

908
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:55,538  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and a desire for wealth...

909
01:52:55,606 --> 01:52:59,007  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
are actually regarded
as legitimate goals.

910
01:52:59,076 --> 01:53:02,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They were minding their own business.
You have no right to beat them!

911
01:53:02,446 --> 01:53:04,641  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm a witness! Have you gone mad?
I'm a teacher, I'll have you know.

912
01:53:04,715 --> 01:53:08,446  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They've turned our piazzas
and monuments into a garbage dump.

913
01:53:08,519 --> 01:53:11,647  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Right!
All they think about is sex.

914
01:53:11,722 --> 01:53:14,520  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't worry, madam. They're not
really hurting them, believe me.

915
01:53:18,795 --> 01:53:22,128  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's beating the hell out of him!
He's killing him.

916
01:53:34,811 --> 01:53:37,837  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Hey, punchy!
- You clowns!

917
01:53:37,915 --> 01:53:43,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You fightin' or dancin'?
I think they're engaged.

918
01:54:10,847 --> 01:54:14,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're nobody! You're nobody!

919
01:54:14,918 --> 01:54:18,547  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're just a lucky son of a bitch,
that's all!

920
01:54:18,622 --> 01:54:21,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's a champion!
He could kill all of you.

921
01:54:21,124 --> 01:54:23,456  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's a real champ!

922
01:54:25,629 --> 01:54:28,393  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The camera.
Somebody swiped the camera!

923
01:54:30,233 --> 01:54:32,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somebody stole the camera!

924
01:55:19,282 --> 01:55:23,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This lady you see walking home along
the wall of an old patrician palazzo...

925
01:55:24,021 --> 01:55:26,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is a Roman actress.:
Anna Magnani.

926
01:55:26,356 --> 01:55:29,223  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
ln a way, she's a symbol
of the city itself.

927
01:55:29,292 --> 01:55:30,384  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What am I?

928
01:55:30,460 --> 01:55:33,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Rome: She-wolf and vestal virgin,
noble woman and fish wife...

929
01:55:33,296 --> 01:55:35,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
somber and festive.

930
01:55:35,465 --> 01:55:37,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I could go on
until tomorrow morning.

931
01:55:37,467 --> 01:55:40,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You better go home
and get some sleep, Federico!

932
01:55:40,137 --> 01:55:44,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Can I ask you a question?
