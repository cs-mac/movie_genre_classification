1
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:06,271
Hey.

2
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,949
Hey, you, whoever you are.

3
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,785
- Are you awake now, princess?
- I want a drink.

4
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,104
- Oh, soon, princess.
- I want it now.

5
00:01:16,272 --> 00:01:18,149
Oh, please...

6
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:20,667
...please get me a drink.

7
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:23,300
For Gods sake, baby,
don't hold out on me.

8
00:01:23,472 --> 00:01:24,746
Is coming up, princess.

9
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:23,545
Princess.

10
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,150
Those two flags just
ought about do it, boys.

11
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:13,980
Well, don't tell me that man with the
middle-age spread is Dan Hatcher.

12
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:18,226
Chance. Chance Wayne.

13
00:04:19,752 --> 00:04:22,391
I never expected to see you again.
Not in these hereabouts.

14
00:04:22,552 --> 00:04:24,588
Just because a man's
successful is no reason...

15
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:28,222
...to forget his old hometown.
- Anything I can do for you, Mr. Wayne?

16
00:04:30,592 --> 00:04:31,866
Yeah, I want a suite.

17
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:33,590
Facing outside to the gulf.

18
00:04:33,752 --> 00:04:35,504
Bedroom, living room, the best.

19
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:38,789
And also service that car out there.

20
00:04:39,552 --> 00:04:41,941
The Cadillac convertible out front.

21
00:04:43,512 --> 00:04:45,343
"Princess Kosmos."

22
00:04:46,112 --> 00:04:47,625
"Princess Kos" what?

23
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:50,704
Kosmonopolis.
The Princess Kosmonopolis.

24
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,388
Hollywood, California?

25
00:04:53,912 --> 00:04:55,868
She is traveling incognito.

26
00:04:56,032 --> 00:04:58,262
Can I let you in on a little secret?

27
00:04:59,672 --> 00:05:04,268
She is also Alexandra Del Lago,
the movie star.

28
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:09,790
She's not feeling very well. Car sickness.
I'll take her up by the veranda.

29
00:05:09,952 --> 00:05:11,385
Honey...

30
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,782
...get me Dr. Scudder
at the Finley Hospital.

31
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:17,020
Hey.

32
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:32,343
Oh, is chance Wayne, all right, sir.
Big as life.

33
00:05:32,672 --> 00:05:35,061
No, doc, he's not exactly alone.

34
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,865
Princess Kosmo
or something or another.

35
00:05:39,032 --> 00:05:41,148
He said she's a moving-picture star.

36
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,746
Will you be right over? How soon?

37
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:13,546
Honey, try to get me Boss Finley
on the phone, will you, please?

38
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:16,661
Did you ever hear of
Princess Kosta-whatsit or...?

39
00:06:28,672 --> 00:06:30,151
Hey.

40
00:06:31,032 --> 00:06:34,263
- What are you doing?
- Don't you want these unpacked, sir?

41
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:37,149
The princess is finicky
about her things.

42
00:06:37,312 --> 00:06:38,904
I'll take care of that later.

43
00:06:39,072 --> 00:06:40,505
Yes, sir.

44
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:43,147
And about that bottle...

45
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,825
I didn't see any bottle, Mr. Wayne.

46
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,101
- How'd you know my name?
- I used to wait tables...

47
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:51,344
<i>...at the club when you'd come
dancing with the same young lady.</i>

48
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:54,504
That pretty young lady.
Boss Finley's daughter.

49
00:06:55,112 --> 00:06:56,511
Yeah.

50
00:06:57,912 --> 00:06:59,903
- What are you called?
- Fly.

51
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:01,471
Just like the fly, sir.

52
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:03,951
Fly.

53
00:07:04,392 --> 00:07:06,303
And when you haul up the rest,
would you...

54
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:08,542
...bring up a bottle of vodka
and some ice?

55
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:09,906
Yes, sir.

56
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:13,189
And write yourself
a $5 tip on the check.

57
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:14,705
Yes, sir.

58
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:16,984
Now, shoo, Fly.

59
00:08:14,672 --> 00:08:17,061
Is okay, princess. Is okay.

60
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:32,383
Good evening, doctor.

61
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:47,221
- Who's that?
- George Scudder.

62
00:08:54,592 --> 00:08:56,469
Hello, doc.
How'd you know I was back?

63
00:08:56,632 --> 00:08:59,146
Bad news travels fast.

64
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:02,828
Is very nice of you to make my
homecoming so warm and so friendly.

65
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:05,506
Your lady friend sounds like
she's coming out of ether.

66
00:09:05,672 --> 00:09:07,628
The princess had a rough night.
Traveling.

67
00:09:07,792 --> 00:09:10,909
- You hooked a princess? Gee!
- She's not using her real name...

68
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:13,791
Golly, I should think not,
checking into hotels with you.

69
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:15,988
George. You are the only
grown man I know...

70
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:18,382
<i>...that still says "gee"
and "golly" and "gosh."</i>

71
00:09:18,552 --> 00:09:20,986
Well, I'm not as sophisticated as you.

72
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:23,541
Get me the Thomas J. Finley Hospital,
please.

73
00:09:24,952 --> 00:09:28,342
- How's Heavenly?
- Don't tell me she's why you came back.

74
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,106
Hello, this is Dr. Scudder. Any calls?

75
00:09:33,632 --> 00:09:36,226
<i>Well, you tell her the
cesarean scar won't be visible...</i>

76
00:09:36,392 --> 00:09:37,950
...to anyone except her husband.

77
00:09:38,112 --> 00:09:39,511
At least, I hope not.

78
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:43,585
All right. I'll take care of that.
I'll be there in 20 minutes. Right.

79
00:09:43,752 --> 00:09:45,902
You sure got the
bedside manner, George.

80
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:49,951
Well, I don't get much practice
since I was made chief of staff.

81
00:09:50,112 --> 00:09:52,672
Oh, man. You've got it made.

82
00:09:52,832 --> 00:09:54,504
Why did you come back here?

83
00:09:54,672 --> 00:09:57,630
Well, I still got a mother
and a girl here, thas why.

84
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,987
Mother's been waiting
for the surprise that I got.

85
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:06,623
But you asked "How's Heavenly,"
not "How's my mother."

86
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,381
I'll take that. The luggage
in the bedroom, please.

87
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:18,951
Yes, sir.

88
00:10:27,312 --> 00:10:28,631
Does a...

89
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:31,226
...chief of staff take a snort, George?

90
00:10:31,392 --> 00:10:32,825
Your...

91
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:35,906
Your mother died a few weeks ago.

92
00:10:47,912 --> 00:10:50,142
This is the death certificate.

93
00:10:52,512 --> 00:10:54,309
Why wasn't I notified?

94
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:55,700
Well, you were.

95
00:10:55,872 --> 00:10:58,432
A few days before she died,
I sent you a telegram.

96
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,787
The last address she had for you.

97
00:11:00,952 --> 00:11:03,705
General delivery, Hollywood.

98
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,191
I got no telegram.

99
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:09,664
After she died, I sent you a letter.
And we never heard from you.

100
00:11:09,832 --> 00:11:11,629
The church took up a nice collection...

101
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,431
...and she was nicely buried
in the family plot.

102
00:11:18,912 --> 00:11:21,506
Don't you even care
that your mother died?

103
00:11:29,072 --> 00:11:30,983
What is that you just took?

104
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,824
A pill.

105
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:34,666
What kind of pill?

106
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:37,187
Oh, benny. Benzedrine.

107
00:11:37,352 --> 00:11:39,388
On prescription?

108
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,866
Yeah. Sort of.

109
00:11:43,032 --> 00:11:45,910
A goofball makes the world
keep its balance.

110
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:49,508
- I don't understand you. I just don't...
- I don't expect you to, George.

111
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,902
I mean your coming back here,
after what I wrote.

112
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:55,064
- You'll be late, chief.
- I wrote you not to come back here ever.

113
00:11:55,232 --> 00:11:57,029
I wrote how Finley
and Tom Jr. Feel...

114
00:11:57,192 --> 00:11:59,865
...about your recent behavior
toward a certain young lady.

115
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,466
- And I also wrote you how that...
- Look, I told you.

116
00:12:02,632 --> 00:12:06,511
Now, I got no letter, I got no telegram.
You got something to tell me, tell me.

117
00:12:06,672 --> 00:12:09,140
I got no letter about
any certain young...

118
00:12:13,592 --> 00:12:15,867
Something happen to Heavenly, George?
Is that it?

119
00:12:16,032 --> 00:12:19,707
Something about Heavenly?
What else did you write in that letter?

120
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:23,911
Well, I see we can't possibly
discuss this in a civilized manner.

121
00:12:28,272 --> 00:12:29,591
All right.

122
00:12:31,112 --> 00:12:33,831
George, if something happened
to Heavenly, tell me, please.

123
00:12:33,992 --> 00:12:35,710
- Give me that bag.
- First tell me.

124
00:12:35,872 --> 00:12:37,544
First the bag.

125
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,626
Now, I'm gonna give you
the best advice you ever had.

126
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:46,625
Take that advice. Get out of town.

127
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,862
You know what the name
Boss Finley means...

128
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>...so don't try to see
Heavenly or talk to her or anything.</i>

129
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:54,666
Now...

130
00:12:54,832 --> 00:12:57,107
<i>...I'll tell the clerk you're checking out.</i>

131
00:12:57,272 --> 00:13:00,184
Go wake Sleeping Beauty
out of her drunken jag and get moving.

132
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:03,264
And keep moving till
you're across the state line.

133
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:08,868
I ain't moving nowhere
till I see my girl.

134
00:13:09,032 --> 00:13:11,182
You don't have a girl in St. Cloud.

135
00:13:11,352 --> 00:13:15,425
Thas what else I wrote. Heavenly
and I are getting married next month.

136
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,784
Excuse me.

137
00:13:23,592 --> 00:13:25,469
You drive carefully, now.

138
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,943
Operator? Give me St. Cloud 5...

139
00:13:46,432 --> 00:13:48,548
What is the number
of the Finley residence?

140
00:13:48,712 --> 00:13:50,304
Oh, no.

141
00:13:51,032 --> 00:13:53,626
Thanks. I'll call back later.

142
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:58,664
Easy, princess.

143
00:13:59,272 --> 00:14:00,830
Who are you?

144
00:14:01,552 --> 00:14:03,190
- Help.
- Hush, now.

145
00:14:03,352 --> 00:14:06,662
- I had a terrible dream.
- Is all right, honey. Chance is with you.

146
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:08,106
- Who?
- Me.

147
00:14:08,272 --> 00:14:09,990
I don't know who you are.

148
00:14:10,152 --> 00:14:12,746
Well, ill come back to you,
honey, as soon as...

149
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:16,871
- What are you looking for?
- Oxygen mask.

150
00:14:17,032 --> 00:14:20,581
- You don't wanna overdo that oxygen...
- I need air. I can't breathe.

151
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:22,185
Will you hurry? I'm dying.

152
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:25,428
Hurry, right now.

153
00:14:25,752 --> 00:14:27,105
Will you come...!

154
00:14:54,192 --> 00:14:57,548
You leave me, please. Just leave me.

155
00:15:13,832 --> 00:15:16,221
Operator, give me St. Cloud 525.

156
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,591
Cool drinks...

157
00:15:25,752 --> 00:15:28,186
...and some cookies.
- Thank you, ma'am.

158
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:29,501
Finley residence.

159
00:15:30,112 --> 00:15:33,024
Miss Heavenly?
Who's calling her, please?

160
00:15:33,472 --> 00:15:34,825
Mr. Chance?

161
00:15:34,992 --> 00:15:38,780
I'm sorry, Mr. Chance,
but Miss Heavenly ain't...

162
00:15:39,872 --> 00:15:42,830
I don't know where she went.
All I know is, she ain't available.

163
00:15:42,992 --> 00:15:44,823
I'll take it, charles.

164
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,664
Chance?

165
00:15:49,952 --> 00:15:51,544
Hello, honey.

166
00:15:52,232 --> 00:15:54,143
This is Aunt Nonnie.

167
00:15:54,552 --> 00:15:55,746
Wait.

168
00:15:55,912 --> 00:15:59,029
- Wait. Where are you?
- That phone call for me, Charles?

169
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:03,424
- No, Mr. Tom.
- Hang up. I'll try to call you back.

170
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:05,981
No, chance. No. Don't.

171
00:16:06,312 --> 00:16:07,791
Aunt Nonnie, I gotta see Heavenly.

172
00:16:07,952 --> 00:16:10,147
George Scudder was just here.
Did something happen?

173
00:16:10,432 --> 00:16:12,866
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Bancroft.

174
00:16:13,032 --> 00:16:14,943
It is Mr. Bancroft, isn't it?

175
00:16:15,272 --> 00:16:17,069
Can't you talk now?

176
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:20,071
Aunt Nonnie, have
Heavenly call me. Please.

177
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:22,827
She can't. I'll call you back.

178
00:16:24,992 --> 00:16:27,711
Downstairs, in the cocktail lounge.
I'll wait.

179
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,429
- You shouldn't have done that, Tom Jr.
- Aunt Nonnie, you're a silly old maid.

180
00:16:34,592 --> 00:16:36,662
And if he calls back, you just hang up.

181
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:40,510
I mean it, Aunt Nonnie. Just hang up.

182
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:45,625
Finley residence.

183
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:47,589
No, Mr. Chance.

184
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,386
She still ain't available.

185
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:53,147
<i>We present this controversial
newsreel as a public service.</i>

186
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:57,061
<i>In 1930, Tom Finley ran
for his first state office.</i>

187
00:16:57,232 --> 00:17:02,260
<i>You all know me. I'm just a
plain old dirt farmer, like you folks.</i>

188
00:17:02,592 --> 00:17:05,345
<i>And Tom Finley was elected.</i>

189
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:07,980
<i>Tom Finley ran for governor.</i>

190
00:17:09,512 --> 00:17:11,901
<i>I'm against loose government...</i>

191
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,428
<i>... loose money and loose women!</i>

192
00:17:15,592 --> 00:17:17,708
<i>And Tom Finley was elected.</i>

193
00:17:17,872 --> 00:17:21,706
<i>Tom Finley built a political machine
and became Boss Finley.</i>

194
00:17:21,872 --> 00:17:24,591
<i>He also built a
plain old dirt farmer's shack...</i>

195
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,504
<i>... worth $300,000.</i>

196
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,142
<i>He sails from his private beach
in his private speedboat.</i>

197
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:34,430
<i>Boss Finley gave away
the offshore oil of his state.</i>

198
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,745
<i>The oil man made Finley a partner...</i>

199
00:17:38,912 --> 00:17:42,382
<i>... and Boss Finley made his
oil partner the governor...</i>

200
00:17:42,552 --> 00:17:46,022
<i>... and kept him in office
all these years.</i>

201
00:17:46,192 --> 00:17:49,628
<i>Four months ago,
Professor Burtus Haven Smith...</i>

202
00:17:49,792 --> 00:17:51,862
<i>... ran against Finley's handpicked man.</i>

203
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:55,869
<i>The only thing you have
to fear is Finley himself.</i>

204
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,751
<i>Next day, Professor Smith, fired.</i>

205
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:01,221
<i>His home was invaded by hoodlums...</i>

206
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:04,350
<i>... books and paintings
burned on the lawn.</i>

207
00:18:05,152 --> 00:18:07,382
<i>Did you recognize any of them, sir?</i>

208
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:11,227
<i>No. They wore masks like this.</i>

209
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,711
<i>I found this button.</i>

210
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:27,062
<i>Yes, sir. I'm president of the
Finley Youth Club, and I'm proud of it.</i>

211
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:30,429
<i>But I don 't know nothing about
no book burnings or...</i>

212
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:33,231
<i>This thing, it could be dropped
accidentally on purpose...</i>

213
00:18:33,392 --> 00:18:36,828
<i>...you know what I mean?
- But to date, there has been no probe...</i>

214
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:39,665
<i>... no police action, no arrests.</i>

215
00:18:39,832 --> 00:18:41,788
<i>- Why?
- Shut that contraption off.</i>

216
00:18:42,432 --> 00:18:47,062
<i>These are the fruits
of Boss Finley's rise to power...</i>

217
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:52,783
How can a Christian TV network
tolerate those filthy, black lies?

218
00:18:52,952 --> 00:18:55,625
- Right here, in the heart of America.
- Why, they ought to be...

219
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,783
Thank you, honey.
- Horsewhipped and shot.

220
00:18:57,952 --> 00:19:01,149
And if I wasn't mayor and against
violence, I'd do it myself.

221
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,872
Well, if that TV report lied,
why not sue them for libel?

222
00:19:04,032 --> 00:19:05,863
If they lied?

223
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,784
You know, you surprise me, Ben.

224
00:19:08,952 --> 00:19:11,625
For a man who's smart enough
to run a big daily newspaper...

225
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,750
<i>...you sure surprise me.
Can't you recognize New York...</i>

226
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:17,062
...Red propaganda when you see it?

227
00:19:17,232 --> 00:19:19,348
Do you call that TV newsreel fair?

228
00:19:19,512 --> 00:19:21,548
Now, Maribelle,
we're all on the same side.

229
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:25,069
- Are we, Ben?
- Fair, you mean?

230
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:27,508
Well, your father's going
on the same network.

231
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:31,068
Same time, same freedom of expression.
I'd say that was pretty fair.

232
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:32,870
A lot fairer than burning books and...

233
00:19:33,032 --> 00:19:34,511
You accusing me, Ben?

234
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:38,228
Why, Tom Jr. Hasn't got
a mean bone in his body.

235
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,702
He might be a hot-blooded
buck like his daddy...

236
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:44,545
<i>- Now, Mrs. Norris.
- ...but he'd never resort to violence.</i>

237
00:19:44,712 --> 00:19:47,863
Never. And you have my personal
guarantee that whoever did do it...

238
00:19:48,032 --> 00:19:49,351
...justice will prevail.

239
00:19:49,512 --> 00:19:51,582
- Right, sheriff?
- Certainly.

240
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,910
What in tarnation are you laughing at?

241
00:19:56,832 --> 00:19:58,823
Nothing, Pa. Nothing at all.

242
00:19:58,992 --> 00:20:00,823
Then shut up!

243
00:20:00,992 --> 00:20:03,222
- Yes, sir.
- Only idiots laugh at nothing.

244
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:05,030
- Yes, sir.
- When I was called from...

245
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:06,864
...the clay hills where I was born...

246
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:10,547
...barefoot and hungry, called by
the voice of God, which I was...

247
00:20:10,712 --> 00:20:13,306
Will somebody pick up
that damn phone!

248
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,102
I ain't never forgot
what I was called for.

249
00:20:18,272 --> 00:20:20,467
I didn't build a land
of milk and honey to see...

250
00:20:20,632 --> 00:20:22,827
- Where you going?
- Get something for that cough.

251
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:25,745
Sit down! I've hawked
and spit all my life...

252
00:20:25,912 --> 00:20:28,187
<i>...and I'll hawk and spit
till the end of my days.</i>

253
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,944
You can bet on that.

254
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,580
When I answer those charges
on TV tomorrow night...

255
00:20:32,752 --> 00:20:35,391
...I expect you to be there.
- Why, you know me, Tom.

256
00:20:35,552 --> 00:20:37,827
I expect you and your
Daughters of Dixie to be there.

257
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:39,983
God bless you, honey.

258
00:20:40,152 --> 00:20:41,983
And I expect you to be there too.

259
00:20:42,152 --> 00:20:44,108
I'll be there, Mr. Finley.
At the press table.

260
00:20:44,272 --> 00:20:46,911
You'll be on the platform,
at my side, in my support.

261
00:20:47,072 --> 00:20:48,824
No, sir. Not so long as you support...

262
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:51,426
...a gang of juvenile delinquents
called Youth Clubs...

263
00:20:51,592 --> 00:20:54,311
- With a free hand to commit mayhem.
- Hold it!

264
00:20:55,032 --> 00:20:57,102
Now, maybe you're right.

265
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:59,547
And maybe, just maybe...

266
00:20:59,712 --> 00:21:02,704
...the Finley Youth Club
was mixed up in that shindig.

267
00:21:02,872 --> 00:21:04,942
Thas why I'm gonna
publicly disavow, disown...

268
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:07,148
...and remove my name
from the Finley Youth Club.

269
00:21:07,632 --> 00:21:11,705
And if my own flesh and blood
was one of them hoodlums...

270
00:21:11,992 --> 00:21:14,711
<i>...he's gonna pay, even though it
brings shame on the memory...</i>

271
00:21:14,872 --> 00:21:18,148
...of his dead mother.
God rest her soul.

272
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,983
They say I stole the oil rights.

273
00:21:21,152 --> 00:21:23,746
Well, if I did, I stole it
for my state and my people.

274
00:21:23,912 --> 00:21:25,709
I also fought the fertilizer trust.

275
00:21:25,872 --> 00:21:29,990
I lowered taxes. I saved our hog-raisers
from the Chicago meatpackers.

276
00:21:30,152 --> 00:21:33,144
A lot of folks like what I did
but they don't like the way I did it.

277
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:37,225
But if a bunch of hogs won't come
out of your garden when you holler:

278
00:21:37,392 --> 00:21:41,067
Then you've gotta use language and
methods that hogs and pigs understand.

279
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,421
Do you understand, Ben?

280
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:51,862
Hi. Martini on the rocks.

281
00:21:52,872 --> 00:21:55,227
Say, you get any phone calls here
for Chance Wayne?

282
00:21:55,392 --> 00:21:57,030
No, sir.

283
00:22:03,352 --> 00:22:06,867
Operator? I'd like to place
a long-distance phone call...

284
00:22:07,032 --> 00:22:09,307
...to Miss Louella Parsons.

285
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:13,828
Thas right. Person-to-person,
from me, Chance Wayne.

286
00:22:15,592 --> 00:22:18,982
Yes, Miss Louella Parsons,
the famous movie columnist.

287
00:22:19,152 --> 00:22:22,781
In Hollywood.
The number is Crestview 1-4222.

288
00:22:22,952 --> 00:22:25,307
Fine. Thank you.

289
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:33,988
Oh, man, don't you know only squares
drink gin martinis with olives?

290
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:37,147
May we have a couple
of gin martinis, please?

291
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:41,021
Didn't you hear the man?
Only squares drink gin.

292
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:45,105
Wait a minute. Leroy. Could you
make that a couple of gin martinis...

293
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:48,821
...with square olives.
- Scotty.

294
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,584
- Well, how are you? Bud.
- Hi.

295
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:52,902
Is that the hand that made love
to Jayne Mansfield?

296
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,586
Gee, I hope you didn't wash that hand.

297
00:22:55,752 --> 00:22:57,788
Gee, I was about ready
to phone you guys.

298
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,988
Leroy, did you know
this is Chance Wayne...

299
00:23:00,152 --> 00:23:02,347
...the famous Hollywood
and Broadway celebrity?

300
00:23:02,752 --> 00:23:04,265
- Really?
- Sure.

301
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:06,787
All bartenders become movie stars.

302
00:23:06,952 --> 00:23:08,351
Right, Chance?

303
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,821
<i>Oh, well... What he's
trying to say is that...</i>

304
00:23:10,992 --> 00:23:12,664
...I had your job for too long.

305
00:23:12,832 --> 00:23:15,027
You know, I designed
that uniform you've got on.

306
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:18,707
I copied it from an outfit Cary Grant
wore in this Foreign Legion picture.

307
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:21,067
- Looks great on you, kid.
- Really?

308
00:23:21,232 --> 00:23:24,383
But kidding aside, fellas,
it is great to be back.

309
00:23:24,552 --> 00:23:25,951
Louella Parsons don't answer.

310
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,951
She know is chance Wayne calling?

311
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:35,061
Operator? Yeah, well, then try...

312
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:36,745
Try Mr. Walter Winchell.

313
00:23:36,912 --> 00:23:38,391
Little black book.

314
00:23:40,512 --> 00:23:42,104
In New York at the Pla...

315
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:44,581
Oh, no, he's... He's in Hollywood.

316
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:47,910
Try Romanoff's.

317
00:23:48,072 --> 00:23:50,188
Yeah. Or Au Petit Jean.

318
00:23:51,152 --> 00:23:52,710
Thank you, ma'am.

319
00:23:54,272 --> 00:23:56,183
Another round for everybody, on me.

320
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:58,747
<i>Hey, man. I'll bet you got some...</i>

321
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:01,107
...snappy numbers
in that little black book, huh?

322
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:02,466
The best.

323
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:04,543
But they're not always in
when you call.

324
00:24:04,712 --> 00:24:06,748
Listen, I'm throwing
a party tomorrow night.

325
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,789
The old crowd,
for Princess Kosmonopolis...

326
00:24:08,952 --> 00:24:10,146
Royalty?

327
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:12,746
- In every way.
- Yeah.

328
00:24:12,912 --> 00:24:15,142
No, I mean, is mostly
a surprise party for Heavenly.

329
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:17,621
Well, I bet her old man
will be plenty surprised.

330
00:24:17,792 --> 00:24:19,350
- What time?
- We can't.

331
00:24:19,512 --> 00:24:22,345
- Oh, the TV rally.
- For Boss Finley.

332
00:24:22,512 --> 00:24:25,948
Hey, Jackie. How about
a fanfare for a very important...

333
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,545
- Jackie!
- For a very...

334
00:24:27,712 --> 00:24:29,304
Hey!

335
00:24:43,832 --> 00:24:45,231
Thanks...

336
00:24:45,672 --> 00:24:47,583
...for remembering our song.
- Anytime.

337
00:24:47,752 --> 00:24:51,381
- Was it written just for you, Mr. Wayne?
- Don't be square, man.

338
00:24:51,872 --> 00:24:54,705
Don't you know that
all lovers got a theme song?

339
00:24:54,872 --> 00:24:56,271
Excuse me.

340
00:24:56,432 --> 00:24:59,390
- Sing it, Chance.
- Here's to the star of our crowd.

341
00:24:59,552 --> 00:25:02,020
Here's to the man who made good.

342
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,350
<i>Chance Wayne...</i>

343
00:25:43,512 --> 00:25:47,221
<i>... will do a front-dive layout.
Swan dive.</i>

344
00:26:33,072 --> 00:26:35,222
Thank you, laddie. Sit down.

345
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:37,225
Not a drinking man yourself?

346
00:26:37,392 --> 00:26:39,383
- Oh, no, sir.
- Well, happy days.

347
00:26:46,192 --> 00:26:49,150
Takes talent to whip up
something soothing like that.

348
00:26:49,832 --> 00:26:51,185
Yeah...

349
00:26:51,552 --> 00:26:54,225
...you sure got
all kinds of talent, laddie.

350
00:26:54,392 --> 00:26:56,030
You like Heavenly, don't you?

351
00:26:56,192 --> 00:26:58,308
- I love her.
- Sure you do. We both love her.

352
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:00,224
- Yes, sir.
- Wanna marry her?

353
00:27:00,392 --> 00:27:03,464
- Yes, sir.
- Thas the way. You're my kind of man.

354
00:27:03,632 --> 00:27:08,581
You got ambition, ideas, youth. And the
good looks to go with them too. But...

355
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,902
...working in a cocktail bar.

356
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,222
Of course, I don't blame you.
Is not your fault.

357
00:27:13,392 --> 00:27:15,701
A town like this got no
elbow room for a go-getter.

358
00:27:15,872 --> 00:27:17,703
No opportunity for a man
who's going places.

359
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,988
Yeah, but Mr. Barnaby,
you know, sporting goods?

360
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,985
He promised me this job as a salesman
in promotional sales.

361
00:27:23,152 --> 00:27:25,427
Small potatoes.

362
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:28,390
Let me tell you something, laddie.

363
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:30,668
This here is America.

364
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:32,788
<i>Today you're nobody...</i>

365
00:27:32,952 --> 00:27:34,749
...tomorrow you're somebody.

366
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:38,427
But you got to think big, act big,
and you'll be big.

367
00:27:38,792 --> 00:27:41,943
Now, I could set you up myself, but...

368
00:27:42,112 --> 00:27:43,591
No, sir. I wouldn't want that.

369
00:27:43,992 --> 00:27:45,141
Thas the way.

370
00:27:45,312 --> 00:27:47,428
You're my kind of man, laddie.

371
00:27:47,592 --> 00:27:50,584
In this world,
there's only one payoff window.

372
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:55,030
Number one, the winner, success.

373
00:27:55,712 --> 00:27:57,464
Now, that can be you.

374
00:27:57,632 --> 00:27:59,065
<i>But a man who's going places...</i>

375
00:27:59,232 --> 00:28:01,302
...he needs a place
where he can climb, bust out.

376
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:05,021
A place like New York. Now, this here
is the ticket thall get you there.

377
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:08,184
Train leaves at 9:40 tonight.
This night.

378
00:28:08,352 --> 00:28:10,741
<i>I'm betting this $ 100 on you, laddie...</i>

379
00:28:10,912 --> 00:28:15,428
...that you come back to St. Cloud
number one, riding high on the hog.

380
00:28:16,832 --> 00:28:18,709
Well, laddie.

381
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,944
But Heavenly, does she know?

382
00:28:21,112 --> 00:28:24,184
She told me to wish you
luck and Godspeed.

383
00:28:24,472 --> 00:28:28,306
Well, I know, but I wanna talk
to her, sir. We made a lot of plans.

384
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:30,191
I plumb forgot.

385
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:33,310
Heavenly and Aunt Nonnie left
for New Orleans this morning...

386
00:28:33,472 --> 00:28:35,064
...taking a boat for Europe.

387
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:37,541
Don't you go forgetting her, now.

388
00:28:37,712 --> 00:28:40,021
You keep in touch, laddie, you hear?

389
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:51,704
Mr. Wayne.

390
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,944
Mr. Wayne!

391
00:28:54,832 --> 00:28:56,584
Long distance, Mr. Wayne.

392
00:28:58,112 --> 00:29:01,229
They can't find Walter Winchell.
This is some secretary named Friday.

393
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:02,666
Hello?

394
00:29:03,072 --> 00:29:04,664
Yeah. Well, this is...

395
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:09,066
Well, when will Mr. Winchell be in?

396
00:29:11,152 --> 00:29:14,110
No. Well, I'm calling for
Alexandra Del Lago, who's...

397
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:16,744
Disappeared? Oh, no, ma'am.

398
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:20,029
She... She has been searching
America for new faces...

399
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:23,867
...and she has found them, and she has
signed them to a personal contract.

400
00:29:24,992 --> 00:29:28,223
<i>Yeah, well, see,
she's producing this film...</i>

401
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:29,825
<i>...called Youth.</i>

402
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,181
Yeah.

403
00:29:33,352 --> 00:29:35,582
Starring Chance Wayne...

404
00:29:35,952 --> 00:29:37,829
...and Heavenly Finley.

405
00:29:37,992 --> 00:29:40,028
Yeah. They're leaving
for Hollywood tomorrow.

406
00:29:40,192 --> 00:29:42,706
Boy? Pencil. Please.

407
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:47,986
Well, the princess is unable to come
to the phone right now. She's out.

408
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,309
No, out for a walk.

409
00:29:54,032 --> 00:29:56,068
Well, sure. Call any time tomorrow.

410
00:29:56,232 --> 00:29:57,631
Thank you.

411
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:02,421
Operator? Say, would you
try the Finley residence again?

412
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:04,663
Good night, mayor.
Good night, Mrs. Norris.

413
00:30:04,832 --> 00:30:07,551
Bye, mayor. I'll get it, charles.

414
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:10,105
Hello.

415
00:30:10,352 --> 00:30:11,865
Well, who's calling?

416
00:30:12,032 --> 00:30:13,670
Now, listen to me,
you lousy son of a...

417
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:16,751
Boy, you just got a natural talent
for being mean and ornery.

418
00:30:16,912 --> 00:30:19,142
You want me to
like this yellow-bellied...?

419
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:21,109
I'd be grateful if you'd think
for once.

420
00:30:21,272 --> 00:30:24,025
Whas to think about?
George told me lover-boy came back...

421
00:30:24,192 --> 00:30:26,752
You already told me what George said.

422
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:30,748
But supposing Mr. Wayne
didn't just happen to come back.

423
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,982
Supposing he was sent for.

424
00:30:33,152 --> 00:30:35,268
To smear his stink
over Heavenly and over me.

425
00:30:35,432 --> 00:30:36,911
Isn't that a reason to go and...?

426
00:30:37,072 --> 00:30:40,189
But supposing he is
just passing through.

427
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:43,469
- Well, which is it?
- Thas what you're gonna go find out.

428
00:30:43,632 --> 00:30:45,145
- Charles.
- Yes, sir?

429
00:30:45,312 --> 00:30:47,667
- Where's Heavenly?
- She's down at the beach, sir.

430
00:30:47,832 --> 00:30:50,426
Lay out a suit and shirt.
I'm going into town tonight.

431
00:30:50,592 --> 00:30:51,866
- Yes, sir.
- Pa.

432
00:30:52,032 --> 00:30:53,704
Get the lead out, boy.

433
00:30:53,872 --> 00:30:57,262
Pa, you didn't mean what you said about
disowning the Finley Youth Clubs?

434
00:30:57,472 --> 00:30:59,588
After what you did to the professor?
I've got to.

435
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:04,507
Burning books, Halloween masks.
You're just plain stupid, boy.

436
00:31:04,672 --> 00:31:07,140
Least you couldve worn white hoods
and burned a cross.

437
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:09,064
- The Klan wouldve been blamed.
- Oh, my.

438
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:12,144
You better stop laughing at nothing
or you'll end up in a nuthouse.

439
00:31:12,312 --> 00:31:14,428
Without me you wouldn't have
won the election...

440
00:31:14,592 --> 00:31:16,230
<i>...and you're not gonna win this one.</i>

441
00:31:16,392 --> 00:31:18,030
- Bull.
- I got you more headlines...

442
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:20,262
...than the last campaign...
- You sure did.

443
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:24,948
Once for drunk driving and once for a
stag party cost me $5000 to hush it up.

444
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:27,068
Nonnie.

445
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:28,984
Hey, you.

446
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,983
Yeah, you.

447
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:33,620
Whas Heavenly doing
down on the beach alone?

448
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:36,306
Just trying to be alone, I guess.

449
00:31:36,472 --> 00:31:39,862
Sure you ain't arranged a meeting
between her and Mr. Wayne?

450
00:31:40,112 --> 00:31:43,548
- No, Tom.
- But you did tell her he was back.

451
00:31:44,232 --> 00:31:47,110
- Yes, Tom.
- Sister-in-law...

452
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:50,105
...you got a powerful lot to answer for.

453
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,785
You favored Chance Wayne...

454
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:55,831
...encouraged, aided and abetted
in his corruption of my baby.

455
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:00,344
That boy never could...

456
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,026
Could never knowingly harm her.

457
00:32:03,192 --> 00:32:05,148
You're like your dead sister.

458
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:06,506
Gullible.

459
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:21,664
Hello, honey.

460
00:32:25,312 --> 00:32:27,906
I don't like you out here all alone.

461
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,506
Why, Papa?
Afraid he might come along?

462
00:32:30,672 --> 00:32:32,788
- Who might come along?
- Oh, Papa.

463
00:32:32,952 --> 00:32:36,103
- I'm concerned, thas all. For you.
- That is very touching, Papa.

464
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:39,025
I'm only trying to save my baby
from being hurt ever again.

465
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:43,071
How? By insisting I marry
Dr. George Scudder?

466
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:46,982
And before him, a 50-year-old moneybags
you needed for your business?

467
00:32:47,152 --> 00:32:48,983
Me? Sell my own flesh and blood?

468
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,380
More than once.

469
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:54,386
Remember the Texas oil tycoon?
And the Washington wheel?

470
00:32:54,552 --> 00:32:56,702
All of them rich, all of them important.

471
00:32:56,872 --> 00:32:59,864
Every one of them
had a powerful feeling for you.

472
00:33:01,752 --> 00:33:04,983
<i>There was a time when
you couldve saved me, Papa...</i>

473
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:09,623
...by letting me marry Chance,
when we were both young and clean.

474
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:12,431
If he loved you so much,
why'd he run off in the first place?

475
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:14,822
You told him he wasn't good enough.

476
00:33:14,992 --> 00:33:17,665
You drove him away to compete
with all those big shots.

477
00:33:17,832 --> 00:33:20,983
- The point is, he went.
- Yes, and he tried.

478
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:23,382
Oh, how he tried.

479
00:33:24,792 --> 00:33:28,228
<i>And when the right doors
wouldn't open...</i>

480
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:30,747
...he went in the wrong ones.

481
00:33:31,992 --> 00:33:33,869
Oh, don't les fight, sugar.

482
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,827
Not you and me. Not when I need you.

483
00:33:36,992 --> 00:33:40,382
For what, Papa? What are you
planning to use me for now?

484
00:33:40,552 --> 00:33:43,862
Why, honey, ever since your angel mama
was took away from me...

485
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:47,229
...you and your brother are all I got
in the world to give my love to.

486
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,190
- That doesn't speak well for Miss Lucy.
- Who is Miss Lucy?

487
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:52,343
That certainly doesn't
speak well for her.

488
00:33:52,512 --> 00:33:54,343
I ain't never heard of no Miss Lucy.

489
00:33:54,512 --> 00:33:57,788
You never heard of the woman you keep
in a $50-a-day suite of rooms...

490
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,624
...at the Regal Palms Hotel?

491
00:33:59,792 --> 00:34:03,262
That charges her clothes and
beauty treatments to your account?

492
00:34:03,432 --> 00:34:06,026
And you say, "Who is Miss Lucy?"

493
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:09,787
Well, keep your love, Papa. Just give me
10 percent of the fortune you spend...

494
00:34:09,952 --> 00:34:13,024
...on this woman you never heard of.
- You keep your mouth shut.

495
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:16,502
- You better tell that to Miss Lucy.
- You keep your mouth shut.

496
00:34:16,672 --> 00:34:18,867
She doesn't speak
very well of you, Papa.

497
00:34:19,032 --> 00:34:22,104
- She says you're not much of a lover.
- Who says Miss Lucy says that?

498
00:34:22,272 --> 00:34:25,344
She wrote it with lipstick
in the ladies' room at the hotel bar.

499
00:34:25,512 --> 00:34:27,025
Wrote what?

500
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:31,026
She wrote,
"Boss Finley can't cut the mustard."

501
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:35,581
That is a ridiculous lie.

502
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:40,030
Oh, Papa. I know
and everyone knows...

503
00:34:40,192 --> 00:34:44,390
...that Miss Lucy was your mistress
long before Mama died.

504
00:34:49,112 --> 00:34:51,546
I never harmed your mother,
as God is my judge.

505
00:34:51,712 --> 00:34:55,671
Careful, Papa. Judgment Day
might be any day.

506
00:35:01,472 --> 00:35:04,589
You listen to me, you ungrateful,
hypocritical slut.

507
00:35:04,752 --> 00:35:07,710
Last week, in the state capital,
when I was speaking on the menace...

508
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,750
...to the chastity of womanhood,
a heckler almost caused a riot.

509
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,311
You know what he hollered?

510
00:35:12,472 --> 00:35:16,670
"Hey, Boss Finley, how about your
daughter? How about her chastity?"

511
00:35:16,832 --> 00:35:21,348
An honest question, Papa.
What was your honest answer?

512
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:24,991
That was my answer.

513
00:35:29,632 --> 00:35:32,192
You have got an illusion of power,
Boss.

514
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:34,991
I have power, and that is no illusion.

515
00:35:35,152 --> 00:35:37,666
You just won't realize
that I'm fighting for my life.

516
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:40,505
I won't embarrass you any more, Papa.

517
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:43,982
- I'll go away. Tonight, if you like.
- You're going nowhere.

518
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:47,110
- You're marrying George Scudder.
- No, Papa, I'm not.

519
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:48,830
- We'll discuss it tomorrow.
- No.

520
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:50,744
- All right.
- Not tomorrow, not ever.

521
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,427
All right. Tomorrow night, you're coming
to the TV rally with me, missy.

522
00:35:54,592 --> 00:35:58,301
You're gonna wear the white of a virgin.
You're gonna wear a smile on your face.

523
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:01,748
You're gonna face that crowd and
TV audience with pride and defiance.

524
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:05,507
- Thas gonna stop all those ugly rumors.
- I won't do it.

525
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:07,871
Then you won't.

526
00:36:08,032 --> 00:36:12,344
And I'm gonna remove chance Wayne
from your life finally and for the last time.

527
00:36:12,512 --> 00:36:15,822
Now, sugar, how do you want him
to leave St. Cloud?

528
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:18,904
In that fishtail Cadillac he come in,
or in the garbage scow...

529
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,710
...that dumps its filth in the gulf?

530
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:23,102
The choice is yours.

531
00:36:24,552 --> 00:36:26,907
Sergeant, get my car out.

532
00:37:07,752 --> 00:37:10,346
Did you have another attack, princess?

533
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:11,911
What was that strange noise?

534
00:37:12,072 --> 00:37:14,506
- Oh, you mean the radio?
- Yes, it frightened me.

535
00:37:14,672 --> 00:37:16,151
Well, some more oxygen?

536
00:37:16,312 --> 00:37:19,224
No. No, I must look hideous in it.

537
00:37:19,392 --> 00:37:21,701
No, honey. You just...
You just look exotic.

538
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:27,228
Yeah, like a princess from Mars,
or a big, magnified insect.

539
00:37:27,392 --> 00:37:30,145
Oh, thank you very much.

540
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:33,463
- Well, maybe I ought to call a doctor?
- No. No, no doctors.

541
00:37:33,632 --> 00:37:35,588
Get me my robe.

542
00:37:35,752 --> 00:37:41,065
When something disturbs me,
I just get a little short-winded, thas all.

543
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:50,268
What is this place? A private hospital?

544
00:37:50,432 --> 00:37:53,708
And you. What are you?

545
00:37:53,872 --> 00:37:56,864
Are you one of those male nurses?

546
00:37:58,952 --> 00:38:00,829
I take care of you,
but I'm not your nurse.

547
00:38:00,992 --> 00:38:03,631
But you're employed by me, is that it?

548
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:06,431
For some purpose or other?

549
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:11,066
- Yep, you're footing the bills.
- I see.

550
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:14,548
- Do you, princess?
- Yes, I see.

551
00:38:14,712 --> 00:38:18,307
I'm used to footing the bills. Hey.

552
00:38:22,912 --> 00:38:24,903
Is your money there?
The jewels accounted for?

553
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:27,506
I'm looking for a pill.

554
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:35,789
May I have something
to wash it down with?

555
00:38:38,992 --> 00:38:41,108
You're not going to give me water.

556
00:38:50,832 --> 00:38:52,151
Hello?

557
00:38:53,992 --> 00:38:55,425
Oh, yes, Mr. Hatcher.

558
00:38:55,592 --> 00:38:57,469
I'm afraid I made a mistake,
Mr. Wayne.

559
00:38:57,632 --> 00:39:01,944
Those rooms you're in,
they're reserved for the Tv rally.

560
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:04,831
<i>Well, I'm sorry too, Mr. Hatcher.</i>

561
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:06,584
You see, Miss Alexandra Del Lago...

562
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,902
- Don't use my name.
...is sound asleep.

563
00:39:09,752 --> 00:39:12,346
- But Miss Del Lago is in no con...
- Don't use my name.

564
00:39:12,512 --> 00:39:14,423
Ask him how long he intends to stay.

565
00:39:15,392 --> 00:39:17,462
- Well, that depends.
- Hang up.

566
00:39:17,632 --> 00:39:20,704
Well, Mr. Hatcher, you wouldn't wanna
bear the responsibility...

567
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:23,386
...for what might happen
to Miss Del Lago if she is...

568
00:39:23,552 --> 00:39:25,941
I said, hang up.

569
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:29,507
I wanna forget who I am.

570
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:35,071
Well, I only used your name to stop
them from evicting us.

571
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:38,429
Will you please shut up?
I'm trying to forget.

572
00:39:40,992 --> 00:39:42,584
Forgetting.

573
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:46,789
What are you trying to forget, princess?
Whare you trying to hide?

574
00:39:47,272 --> 00:39:49,706
You're all out of focus.

575
00:39:50,472 --> 00:39:51,905
Don't I have any glasses?

576
00:39:52,792 --> 00:39:54,111
Where are my glasses?

577
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:55,944
Well, you had a little accident.

578
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:59,741
- Oh, what was that?
- You fell flat on your face with them on.

579
00:40:02,272 --> 00:40:04,661
- Where'd you put them?
- Lf I was in that condition...

580
00:40:04,832 --> 00:40:08,791
<i>...I wouldn't know
where anything I had with me was.</i>

581
00:40:08,952 --> 00:40:11,102
Or anything I did.

582
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:14,463
By the way, did we do anything?

583
00:40:14,632 --> 00:40:17,226
Mostly you've been
knocking yourself out...

584
00:40:17,392 --> 00:40:19,110
...with one thing or another.

585
00:40:19,272 --> 00:40:21,502
Did we spend the night together?

586
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:24,140
Oh, yes, ma'am.

587
00:40:25,312 --> 00:40:26,904
But I did not molest you.

588
00:40:27,952 --> 00:40:32,025
Well, should I thank you for that
or accuse you of cheating?

589
00:40:34,272 --> 00:40:38,868
I like you. You are a nice monster.

590
00:40:39,352 --> 00:40:44,028
Well, I was born a monster. And you?

591
00:40:46,872 --> 00:40:48,942
One lens cracked.

592
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:53,947
I don't mind waking up in an intimate
situation with someone...

593
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:57,263
...but I do like to see who it is.

594
00:40:58,432 --> 00:41:02,584
So I can make whatever adjustment
seems called for.

595
00:41:08,712 --> 00:41:09,986
Well.

596
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:15,340
I may have done better...

597
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:19,427
...but God knows I have done worse.

598
00:41:37,152 --> 00:41:39,302
Do you remember where we met?

599
00:41:43,912 --> 00:41:48,588
Well, this much I do remember:
That I like bodies...

600
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:53,348
...to be silky-smooth, hard gold.

601
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:55,424
- Do you remember where we met?
- No.

602
00:41:55,592 --> 00:41:57,742
- And the circumstances?
- No.

603
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,231
All I remember is us...

604
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:04,386
...driving through a town
called Tallahassee.

605
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:08,545
- And before that?
- That water. Is that the Pacific Ocean?

606
00:42:08,712 --> 00:42:10,430
No, ma'am, thas the gulf.

607
00:42:10,592 --> 00:42:12,230
What gulf?

608
00:42:13,832 --> 00:42:16,665
The gulf of misunderstanding
between you and me.

609
00:42:17,832 --> 00:42:19,743
- Is not that funny.
- Oh, yes, it is.

610
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:22,301
Thas exactly what Bennie Taubman
said to me.

611
00:42:22,472 --> 00:42:25,145
<i>"Sweetie, sweetie," he said...</i>

612
00:42:25,312 --> 00:42:28,782
- No more gulfs between you and I.
- Bennie.

613
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:31,591
This comeback will be
the greatest success in history.

614
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:33,470
- Miss Del Lago.
- I'm worried, Bennie.

615
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:36,100
You leave the worrying to me.
Excuse us for a minute.

616
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:38,467
You've been a top star for 15 years.

617
00:42:38,632 --> 00:42:41,465
You've got millions of fans.
Loyal, devoted.

618
00:42:41,632 --> 00:42:44,669
Devoted to the way I used to be,
the way I used to look.

619
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:46,345
Bennie, I am scared.

620
00:42:46,512 --> 00:42:49,231
- You? Never.
- Miss Del Lago!

621
00:42:49,392 --> 00:42:53,908
You're a professional, an artist,
a personality.

622
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:58,463
Alexandra Del Lago is the sex symbol
of America.

623
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:02,662
- Say, Charlie, how about it?
- She's coming.

624
00:43:02,832 --> 00:43:05,630
- Thank you.
- Playback.

625
00:43:06,112 --> 00:43:08,672
Get me a little something, will you?

626
00:43:11,392 --> 00:43:16,102
- God, no.
- Whas the matter?

627
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:19,708
I remembered the thing
I wanted to forget.

628
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:24,229
The stupid, senseless end of my life,
thas all.

629
00:43:24,952 --> 00:43:28,627
No wonder I didn't want
to remember. I was no fool.

630
00:43:28,792 --> 00:43:30,987
- You want some oxygen?
- No.

631
00:43:31,752 --> 00:43:33,947
Where is it? Where is the stuff?

632
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,580
Did you leave it in the car?
I want it now.

633
00:43:36,752 --> 00:43:38,629
Those pills aren't any good.

634
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,384
Is right here.

635
00:43:42,032 --> 00:43:45,468
Well, that is a brilliant place to put it.

636
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:59,510
Hotel maid sometimes do clean
under mattresses, you know.

637
00:44:01,352 --> 00:44:03,070
Wouldn't that be pretty?

638
00:44:03,232 --> 00:44:08,181
A year in one of those model prisons
for distinguished addicts.

639
00:44:08,472 --> 00:44:10,667
This is pretty high-class pot.
Where'd you get it?

640
00:44:10,832 --> 00:44:13,904
You beautiful, stupid young man.
That is not pot.

641
00:44:14,072 --> 00:44:16,984
Is hashish. Moroccan, and the finest.

642
00:44:17,152 --> 00:44:19,985
Pop star. Is insanity.

643
00:44:20,152 --> 00:44:25,431
The legend of Alexandra Del Lago was...
Was youth.

644
00:44:27,552 --> 00:44:30,749
I was right. I told him I was right.

645
00:44:30,912 --> 00:44:35,269
Why...?
Why didn't I trust my instincts?

646
00:44:35,712 --> 00:44:40,342
They've stood me in good stead
for many, many a year.

647
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,309
Where does one retire to?

648
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,782
There is no place to retire to
when you retire from the movies.

649
00:44:45,952 --> 00:44:50,070
No place except oblivion.

650
00:44:51,312 --> 00:44:56,261
One thing thall help you
forget oblivion is...

651
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:59,583
This. Is this.

652
00:45:08,552 --> 00:45:11,510
If I had just been old.
But, you see, I wasn't old.

653
00:45:11,672 --> 00:45:14,948
I just wasn't young. Not young.
I just wasn't young anymore.

654
00:45:15,112 --> 00:45:16,909
Nobody's young anymore.

655
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:20,109
Stars in retirement
sometimes give acting lessons.

656
00:45:20,272 --> 00:45:23,582
They give beauty hints,
they write gossip columns.

657
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:25,629
Princess, just smoke.

658
00:45:25,792 --> 00:45:27,384
Oh, yes.

659
00:45:30,792 --> 00:45:32,145
Smoke.

660
00:45:32,832 --> 00:45:34,902
And after this...

661
00:45:35,352 --> 00:45:37,946
...the mercenary young lovers.

662
00:45:38,552 --> 00:45:41,350
- Like me?
- Yes, like you.

663
00:45:41,512 --> 00:45:45,664
Your comeback. I mean, what happened?
You just didn't have it anymore?

664
00:45:46,352 --> 00:45:51,380
Oh, I had it. I had the will
and I had the talent to go with it.

665
00:45:52,512 --> 00:45:54,628
But the camera.

666
00:45:54,792 --> 00:45:58,228
The camera doesn't know how to lie.

667
00:45:58,392 --> 00:46:01,304
The screen is a very clear mirror.

668
00:46:01,472 --> 00:46:05,226
There is a thing, God help us,
called a close-up.

669
00:46:05,392 --> 00:46:08,464
Camera number one in position.
Finish your candles, there, boys.

670
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,224
Playback.

671
00:46:23,592 --> 00:46:26,789
<i>The camera dollies in.</i>

672
00:46:27,312 --> 00:46:31,430
<i>And you, your head, your face...</i>

673
00:46:31,592 --> 00:46:34,504
<i>... are caught in the frame
with the lights blazing.</i>

674
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:38,984
<i>And all your terrible history
screams while you smile.</i>

675
00:46:39,152 --> 00:46:43,987
No. No, no, no. Hold it, hold it.

676
00:46:44,152 --> 00:46:48,384
I told you I want a shadow right here
on her neck. You understand?

677
00:46:48,552 --> 00:46:51,225
Not your fault, sweetie. You're terrific.

678
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,303
Okay, Charlie. We go again.
Right now.

679
00:46:53,472 --> 00:46:55,110
- Camera, number one position.
- Playback.

680
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:58,025
- Quiet.
- All right, places, everybody.

681
00:46:58,952 --> 00:47:05,141
<i>And then, before you know it,
comes the night of the preview.</i>

682
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:27,667
<i>The first part of the film, I felt so safe.</i>

683
00:47:45,152 --> 00:47:48,622
- What did you say her name was?
- Alexandra Del Lago, stupe.

684
00:47:48,792 --> 00:47:50,350
I thought she was dead and buried.

685
00:47:59,872 --> 00:48:02,670
Sweetie, wait. Believe me. Please.

686
00:48:03,712 --> 00:48:06,226
Miss Del Lago, one more picture, please.

687
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:08,223
She fell. Oh, poor thing.

688
00:48:08,392 --> 00:48:11,384
- She's drunk.
- They're all drunks, all of them.

689
00:48:15,472 --> 00:48:18,908
After that, flight.

690
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:23,270
Running away from that
frightful comeback.

691
00:48:23,432 --> 00:48:27,391
I never stopped running until now.

692
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:38,751
- Know what you need right now?
- Yes, to forget again.

693
00:48:41,232 --> 00:48:42,711
First we...

694
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:45,301
We let the hash take effect.

695
00:48:46,712 --> 00:48:48,191
And then...

696
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:50,348
...we apply the magic formula.

697
00:48:50,512 --> 00:48:51,991
What?

698
00:48:53,032 --> 00:48:57,105
Like we did in Palm Beach, remember?

699
00:48:58,392 --> 00:49:02,863
That soothing, magical formula
called papaya cream.

700
00:49:03,832 --> 00:49:07,381
Yes. Yes.

701
00:49:08,592 --> 00:49:11,470
Papaya-cream rubs.

702
00:49:18,592 --> 00:49:23,541
Were you one of those faceless
young bodies in Palm Beach?

703
00:49:24,112 --> 00:49:25,830
Well, thas where we met.

704
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:29,268
Don't you remember, in your
private cabana, on the beach?

705
00:49:29,432 --> 00:49:32,981
And you were breathless.
I mean, just like you are right now.

706
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:35,586
It was painful. Painful to see.

707
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:39,301
And you were the anesthetic
that eased my pain.

708
00:49:39,992 --> 00:49:42,586
Yeah, and you were smoking.

709
00:49:42,752 --> 00:49:44,743
Just like you are right now.

710
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:51,262
That feels so...

711
00:49:51,432 --> 00:49:55,391
I don't remember your face,
but your hands are familiar.

712
00:49:55,552 --> 00:49:58,112
There. That hash,
how'd you get hooked?

713
00:49:58,272 --> 00:50:01,548
On my way to Europe,
running away from my comeback.

714
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:04,272
The ship's doctor gave me injections.

715
00:50:04,432 --> 00:50:08,186
Did he know he was giving narcotics
to the famous Alexandra Del Lago?

716
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:12,265
He just knew he was helping a woman
suffering from neuritis.

717
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:15,708
The hashish came later. In Tangier.

718
00:50:15,872 --> 00:50:17,942
How'd you get it into the States,
smuggle it?

719
00:50:18,112 --> 00:50:19,465
Know another way?

720
00:50:19,632 --> 00:50:22,271
You mean you smuggled it right past
customs, princess?

721
00:50:22,432 --> 00:50:24,662
What are you trying to prove?

722
00:50:24,832 --> 00:50:27,630
Nothing. No, I just...

723
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:30,102
Don't forget, you're the one
that introduced me...

724
00:50:30,272 --> 00:50:31,864
...to this fine old Moroccan hash.

725
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:35,943
Boy, I doubt very much
if I have any vice...

726
00:50:36,112 --> 00:50:38,580
...old or new,
that I could introduce to you.

727
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:42,028
- Ma'am, don't call me boy.
- You knew all about this stuff, Carl.

728
00:50:42,192 --> 00:50:45,662
- My name is not carl, is chance.
- You called yourself Carl in Palm Beach.

729
00:50:45,832 --> 00:50:47,788
I always carry an extra name
in my pocket.

730
00:50:47,952 --> 00:50:50,261
Why, are you a criminal?

731
00:50:50,872 --> 00:50:52,385
No, ma'am, not me.

732
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:55,862
I mean, you're the one thas committed
a federal crime.

733
00:51:10,592 --> 00:51:11,786
Whad you do that for?

734
00:51:11,952 --> 00:51:14,785
I thought you mighve
planted someone outside the door.

735
00:51:15,312 --> 00:51:17,189
Don't you trust me?

736
00:51:20,672 --> 00:51:24,426
Who taught you to rub
desperate ladies the right way?

737
00:51:24,592 --> 00:51:27,902
And you say all you did
was manipulate the papaya cream?

738
00:51:28,072 --> 00:51:30,745
- Well, more or less.
- How much more?

739
00:51:30,912 --> 00:51:33,790
Ma'am, if we'd made love,
you'd have remembered it.

740
00:51:33,952 --> 00:51:39,982
Well, what stopped you? Certainly not I.
And certainly not your ethics.

741
00:51:40,232 --> 00:51:44,020
Whas the angle?
Why did you hold out?

742
00:51:44,192 --> 00:51:45,944
I held out till you signed a contract.

743
00:51:46,112 --> 00:51:49,388
Well, evidently I signed.

744
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:51,908
Why did you still hold out?

745
00:51:52,072 --> 00:51:54,791
- I wanted to hold your interest.
- Well, you miscalculated.

746
00:51:54,952 --> 00:51:58,706
My interest always increases
with satisfaction.

747
00:51:58,872 --> 00:52:01,625
You mean you don't intend
to live up to that contract?

748
00:52:01,792 --> 00:52:05,944
I can get out of that contract
any time I want to.

749
00:52:06,112 --> 00:52:09,707
- Do you have any talent?
- For what?

750
00:52:09,872 --> 00:52:11,703
Acting, baby.

751
00:52:12,112 --> 00:52:16,867
Acting. A contract for acting
implies that you are an actor. Are you?

752
00:52:17,032 --> 00:52:19,705
I've been an extra in movies
long enough to know that...

753
00:52:19,872 --> 00:52:24,070
...I can be as big a star as some of them
she-men that have made it. Princess.

754
00:52:25,912 --> 00:52:27,550
Princess?

755
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:31,185
All I need is just one big break.

756
00:52:31,352 --> 00:52:34,469
- Carl, it takes more than one break.
- Chance. Chance. Chance Wayne.

757
00:52:34,632 --> 00:52:38,910
- You're stoned.
- Baby, there is no easy way to the top.

758
00:52:40,632 --> 00:52:43,385
You can forget about magic formulas
and trick contracts.

759
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:45,622
Forget about this false dream.

760
00:52:45,792 --> 00:52:47,783
Okay, say it, princess.
What is it you want?

761
00:52:47,952 --> 00:52:52,468
Come here. Les comfort
each other a little.

762
00:52:53,952 --> 00:52:56,341
Thas right.

763
00:52:56,512 --> 00:52:58,104
Princess?

764
00:52:59,712 --> 00:53:02,067
You know something, honey?

765
00:53:03,232 --> 00:53:07,066
That all that talk about narcotics...

766
00:53:07,672 --> 00:53:10,140
<i>...is been recorded on tape.</i>

767
00:53:14,352 --> 00:53:17,981
- Where did you get that thing?
- You bought it for me in Palm Beach.

768
00:53:18,152 --> 00:53:20,347
To improve my diction.

769
00:53:20,912 --> 00:53:24,507
<i>- Comeback. The ship 's doctor
gave me injections.</i>

770
00:53:24,672 --> 00:53:28,506
<i>Did he know he was giving narcotics
to the famous Alexandra Del Lago?</i>

771
00:53:28,672 --> 00:53:32,460
<i>He just knew he was helping a woman
suffering from neuritis.</i>

772
00:53:32,632 --> 00:53:35,510
<i>The hashish came later. In Tangier.</i>

773
00:53:35,672 --> 00:53:37,788
- Blackmail, is it?
- Thas very ugly language.

774
00:53:37,952 --> 00:53:41,991
The language of the gutter is understood
by anyone who ever fell in it. Price?

775
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:44,188
I just want you
to live up to this contract.

776
00:53:44,352 --> 00:53:46,422
- And thas not all.
- Money?

777
00:53:47,192 --> 00:53:49,865
- And if I refuse?
- Well, you won't.

778
00:53:50,032 --> 00:53:52,751
You wouldn't want the FBI
to get ahold of these recordings.

779
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:55,028
- Chance.
- Or the newspapers...

780
00:53:55,192 --> 00:53:59,743
...and those bigshot columnists?
And the dirt magazines?

781
00:54:00,752 --> 00:54:03,903
Princess, you got a big name
to protect. You still got a reputation.

782
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:08,987
I had, baby, I had.
I have been blackmailed by experts.

783
00:54:09,152 --> 00:54:11,586
I hate to think what desperation
has made you think...

784
00:54:11,752 --> 00:54:13,390
...that you can try to intimidate me.

785
00:54:13,552 --> 00:54:16,703
Me, Alexandra Del Lago,
with this ridiculous...

786
00:54:16,872 --> 00:54:21,343
Oh, chance, is silly.
Is so silly, is touching.

787
00:54:21,512 --> 00:54:24,743
Is downright endearing.
Makes me feel close to you.

788
00:54:24,912 --> 00:54:28,348
Now, I gotta see somebody.
I want some cash and I want your car.

789
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:32,711
Here. Here. Now, you'd better start
signing these traveler's checks, or I'Il...

790
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:37,343
Or what? Oh, put that away,
and that leaky fountain pen.

791
00:54:37,512 --> 00:54:41,141
When monster meets monster,
one monster has to give way...

792
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:42,745
...and it will never be me.

793
00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:48,305
Now, then, signed checks are payment.
Delivery comes first.

794
00:54:48,472 --> 00:54:52,021
<i>I have only one way to forget the things
that I don't want to remember...</i>

795
00:54:52,192 --> 00:54:54,990
...and that way is through making love.

796
00:54:55,152 --> 00:54:59,430
Is the only dependable distraction,
and I need that distraction right now.

797
00:54:59,592 --> 00:55:04,029
In the morning, we'll talk about
what you want and what you need.

798
00:55:04,192 --> 00:55:05,989
Aren't you ashamed a little?

799
00:55:06,152 --> 00:55:08,985
Yes. Aren't you?

800
00:55:10,352 --> 00:55:11,546
More than a little.

801
00:55:12,072 --> 00:55:16,782
Close the curtains, please.
Then come here to me.

802
00:55:16,952 --> 00:55:22,743
And make me almost believe
that we are a pair of young lovers...

803
00:55:22,912 --> 00:55:24,743
...without any shame.

804
00:55:46,472 --> 00:55:48,667
Two things, Pa.

805
00:55:48,832 --> 00:55:52,745
First, he's bedding in with a broken-down
old movie star, Alexandra Del Lago.

806
00:55:52,912 --> 00:55:55,585
But she's still famous and capable
of causing us trouble...

807
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,744
Second, Mr. Wayne don't show
any inclination to move on.

808
00:55:58,912 --> 00:55:59,947
I told him...

809
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:02,387
- ...she's not well enough to travel.
- Bull.

810
00:56:04,232 --> 00:56:07,429
If you roughhouse this woman,
every newspaper's gonna be down here.

811
00:56:07,592 --> 00:56:09,503
But if we separate Mr. Wayne
from his lady...

812
00:56:09,672 --> 00:56:12,186
...we could proceed more directly,
if it was necessary.

813
00:56:12,352 --> 00:56:15,264
Right, sir. You're the doctor,
call an ambulance.

814
00:56:15,432 --> 00:56:17,992
- Haul queenie to the hospital.
- Without her permission?

815
00:56:18,152 --> 00:56:20,950
Say she's contagious.
Bubonic plague, typhoid fever.

816
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:24,104
- I'm not gonna let you involve me in this.
- Lower your voice.

817
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:27,105
- He's not gonna involve me in this...
- Doctor, laddie...

818
00:56:27,272 --> 00:56:31,311
...you are already involved right up
to your scrofulous chicken neck.

819
00:56:32,512 --> 00:56:36,664
I've done anything you ever asked me.
Anything.

820
00:56:36,832 --> 00:56:40,541
But one public mistake,
one slip, and we...

821
00:56:40,712 --> 00:56:45,024
Laddie, you've got all the symptoms
of a nervous breakdown.

822
00:56:48,752 --> 00:56:52,631
Now, my prescription for you
is a weekend vacation.

823
00:56:52,792 --> 00:56:55,386
A change of scenery
to build up your backbone.

824
00:56:55,552 --> 00:56:57,782
I'd say you're sickly. Critical.

825
00:56:58,272 --> 00:56:59,990
Might be even terminal.

826
00:57:00,152 --> 00:57:03,224
So you'd better leave quick. Tonight.

827
00:57:03,392 --> 00:57:06,589
- See the doc don't miss his train.
- Yes, sir.

828
00:57:08,472 --> 00:57:10,747
- Happy Easter, Fly.
- Thank you, sir.

829
00:57:10,912 --> 00:57:12,425
- Happy Easter.
- Thank you, governor.

830
00:57:12,592 --> 00:57:15,390
- Shall I ring her, say you're coming up?
- No.

831
00:57:26,032 --> 00:57:27,590
Lucy?

832
00:57:34,112 --> 00:57:35,830
Lucy?

833
00:57:41,872 --> 00:57:44,466
Hiya, honey.
I'll be with you in a second.

834
00:57:44,632 --> 00:57:46,907
How can you watch two TVs,
chop your toenails...

835
00:57:47,072 --> 00:57:49,791
...stuff yourself with chocolates
all at the same time?

836
00:57:49,952 --> 00:57:51,351
I already seen the movie.

837
00:57:51,512 --> 00:57:53,707
Shut that damn thing off.

838
00:57:58,192 --> 00:57:59,864
I said, shut it...!

839
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:05,384
My, my, my.

840
00:58:06,032 --> 00:58:07,385
Ain't we in a mood.

841
00:58:17,552 --> 00:58:22,831
Guess what I got for you,
for an Easter present.

842
00:58:22,992 --> 00:58:26,029
I went all the way
to New Orleans for it.

843
00:58:28,032 --> 00:58:30,500
Close your eyes, lover.

844
00:58:30,832 --> 00:58:35,622
This is a mighty exciting surprise.
Don't look.

845
00:58:38,992 --> 00:58:40,141
Like?

846
00:58:40,312 --> 00:58:41,745
Is that for me?

847
00:58:41,912 --> 00:58:46,702
Well, I surely don't intend to give it
to anybody else.

848
00:58:46,872 --> 00:58:51,866
Oh, feast your tired old eyes,
daddy doll.

849
00:58:52,512 --> 00:58:57,950
I sure do hope that this brings out
the beast in you.

850
00:59:06,032 --> 00:59:08,182
Happy Easter, sugar.

851
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,785
For me?

852
00:59:18,432 --> 00:59:21,071
You'll spoil me yet, honey.

853
00:59:21,352 --> 00:59:23,820
Oh, why, is lovely.

854
00:59:23,992 --> 00:59:27,507
Is a lovely Easter egg.

855
00:59:27,912 --> 00:59:29,265
Am I supposed to eat it?

856
00:59:29,712 --> 00:59:30,827
Open the top.

857
00:59:30,992 --> 00:59:36,146
It sure takes a powerful kind of rooster
to lay this kind of egg.

858
00:59:36,312 --> 00:59:38,906
Oh, darling, you shouldn't have.

859
00:59:39,072 --> 00:59:41,506
Why not? You deserve
everything you get.

860
00:59:41,672 --> 00:59:44,550
Oh, I'm so nervous.

861
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:48,950
Like it, sugar baby?

862
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:51,985
Is absolutely divine.

863
00:59:52,152 --> 00:59:53,471
Is heavenly.

864
01:00:05,712 --> 01:00:07,942
<i>Thas better. Now...</i>

865
01:00:08,112 --> 01:00:11,422
<i>...you go downstairs to the
ladies' room of the cocktail lounge...</i>

866
01:00:11,592 --> 01:00:15,426
...and you write on the toilet mirror
with this same lipstick:

867
01:00:15,592 --> 01:00:20,222
"Miss Lucy is available to any punk's
got $5 and can cut the mustard."

868
01:00:21,792 --> 01:00:25,467
You know, I don't very much
like my Easter surprise.

869
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:11,468
Hello? Operator, did you get
the Finley residence yet?

870
01:01:12,872 --> 01:01:14,544
Aunt Nonnie?

871
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,742
Well, can you talk now?

872
01:01:17,912 --> 01:01:20,142
Well, can I see you, then?

873
01:01:20,312 --> 01:01:22,906
Well, I can... Where?

874
01:01:24,152 --> 01:01:25,665
Well, how soon?

875
01:01:26,032 --> 01:01:28,500
All right. I'll meet you there.

876
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:31,266
Aunt Nonnie, whatever it is
that happened, I can explain.

877
01:01:31,432 --> 01:01:32,911
And listen...

878
01:01:33,392 --> 01:01:34,984
...I got it made.

879
01:01:35,152 --> 01:01:37,222
No, I really got it made.

880
01:01:37,392 --> 01:01:38,984
All right.

881
01:01:44,512 --> 01:01:46,104
Princess?

882
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:51,865
Princess?

883
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:02,266
Pure, hard gold, all right.

884
01:02:02,432 --> 01:02:04,627
<i>Yeah. Well, I'm glad
you're appreciative...</i>

885
01:02:04,792 --> 01:02:08,990
<i>...but, you know, I'm going out pretty
soon and my credit is kind of shaky.</i>

886
01:02:09,152 --> 01:02:11,063
I would like to smoke, please.

887
01:02:12,872 --> 01:02:16,706
No, no. Just one of the ordinary
cigarettes that only give you cancer.

888
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:22,946
What are those lovely bells?

889
01:02:23,112 --> 01:02:24,989
Why, madam, it is Easter Sunday.

890
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:28,508
How fitting. I feel absolutely reborn.

891
01:02:28,672 --> 01:02:33,223
Yes. The world and I are on
very good terms this morning.

892
01:02:33,392 --> 01:02:36,509
Yeah, well, we made a little bargain
last night, remember?

893
01:02:36,672 --> 01:02:38,583
Oh, yes.

894
01:02:38,912 --> 01:02:41,346
Well, I will live up to my end
of the bargain...

895
01:02:41,512 --> 01:02:44,151
...after I have put on my face.

896
01:02:44,312 --> 01:02:47,748
The face I face the world with, baby.

897
01:02:48,872 --> 01:02:51,625
Will you open the curtains, please?

898
01:02:53,312 --> 01:02:55,428
There something out there
you're afraid of?

899
01:02:56,592 --> 01:03:01,108
Oh, no, ma'am. The thing I want most
in the world is out there.

900
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:03,467
This town belonged to me once.

901
01:03:04,792 --> 01:03:06,544
And will again.

902
01:03:06,712 --> 01:03:08,623
Were you born here?

903
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:11,989
- On the wrong side of the tracks, but...
- Well, most of us were, baby.

904
01:03:14,112 --> 01:03:17,070
You know, the set that I ran with
was a snob set.

905
01:03:17,232 --> 01:03:20,827
You know, they had family,
big names, big money.

906
01:03:20,992 --> 01:03:23,267
- All I had was...
- Beauty.

907
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:26,390
Say it. What you had was beauty.

908
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,544
I had it, and I say it with pride.

909
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:31,831
Yeah.

910
01:03:31,992 --> 01:03:34,904
Well, the others were born satisfied.

911
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:37,711
Well, I had to get something better.
And I did.

912
01:03:38,712 --> 01:03:40,668
I got it.

913
01:03:40,832 --> 01:03:43,744
While my friends were
doing the conventional things...

914
01:03:43,952 --> 01:03:46,261
...like flunking out
of state university...

915
01:03:46,432 --> 01:03:49,026
...I appeared in the biggest stage hit
on Broadway.

916
01:03:49,192 --> 01:03:53,026
<i>I had my picture on the cover of
LIFE magazine.</i>

917
01:03:57,632 --> 01:03:59,862
And, at the same time...

918
01:04:00,032 --> 01:04:04,184
...I was employing my other talent,
lovemaking.

919
01:04:04,992 --> 01:04:09,144
That may be the only talent
you were ever truly meant for.

920
01:04:10,752 --> 01:04:14,904
I've wallowed in a social register
of New York...

921
01:04:15,472 --> 01:04:17,986
...with discreet wives
in the millionaire set...

922
01:04:18,152 --> 01:04:20,825
...and debutante daughters
in the horsy set.

923
01:04:20,992 --> 01:04:22,744
Did they foot the bills too?

924
01:04:22,912 --> 01:04:27,667
Yeah. But I always gave them
much more than I took.

925
01:04:27,832 --> 01:04:32,952
To older women, I gave back a feeling
of excitement and youth.

926
01:04:33,472 --> 01:04:35,463
To sad, lost women...

927
01:04:36,792 --> 01:04:40,148
...a merciful display of affection
and temporary hope.

928
01:04:40,712 --> 01:04:42,509
Eccentrics?

929
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:46,549
Understanding, tolerance.

930
01:04:46,712 --> 01:04:49,067
You must have been quite
a successful enterprise.

931
01:04:49,232 --> 01:04:52,429
- Oh, I was going places.
- Where?

932
01:04:52,592 --> 01:04:54,264
Successville.

933
01:04:54,432 --> 01:04:55,945
My name was appearing in columns...

934
01:04:56,112 --> 01:04:58,148
...I was promised this part
in a big Broadway play...

935
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:00,143
...Hollywood was nibbling.

936
01:05:00,312 --> 01:05:02,428
I was getting to be somebody.

937
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:04,901
Then it was time for me
to come home for my girl...

938
01:05:05,072 --> 01:05:07,427
...take her away with me,
like I promised.

939
01:05:09,112 --> 01:05:12,309
And when I came home, oh, man.

940
01:05:12,472 --> 01:05:15,862
This town just buzzed
with excitement.

941
01:05:29,232 --> 01:05:31,063
Chance.

942
01:05:38,072 --> 01:05:42,623
<i>She never asked about the others.
Well, she didn 't have to.</i>

943
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:48,864
<i>Of course, she knew that nothing I did
or was done to...</i>

944
01:05:49,032 --> 01:05:52,661
<i>... could ever cancel out our love,
the pleasure we gave each other.</i>

945
01:05:53,472 --> 01:05:56,066
You know, the big difference
between people...

946
01:05:56,232 --> 01:05:58,348
...is not between rich and poor
or good and evil.

947
01:05:58,512 --> 01:06:01,629
The biggest of all differences
between people...

948
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:06,308
...is between those that have had
pleasure in love and those that haven't.

949
01:06:06,832 --> 01:06:10,381
<i>We interrupt this program to bring you
a bulletin from Washington.</i>

950
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:13,464
<i>It was officially announced
that United States ground forces...</i>

951
01:06:13,632 --> 01:06:15,623
<i>... entered the Korean War today.</i>

952
01:06:15,792 --> 01:06:18,909
<i>President Truman termed
the intervention a police action.</i>

953
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:22,303
And I am positive there's no finer,
no braver, no more patriotic man...

954
01:06:22,472 --> 01:06:27,466
...to lead our Dixie Regiment
than our own hometown boy...

955
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:29,304
...Chance Wayne.

956
01:06:34,112 --> 01:06:35,431
Congratulations.

957
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:46,707
All I could think was,
"This stops everything."

958
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:48,988
Just when things were going great...

959
01:06:49,152 --> 01:06:52,906
...the end. Period. Even if I was lucky,
I'd have to start all over again.

960
01:06:53,072 --> 01:06:54,903
You and a few million others.

961
01:06:55,072 --> 01:06:59,270
Their jobs would be waiting for them,
but my trade was youth.

962
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,868
And war either makes you age fast
or die fast.

963
01:07:04,192 --> 01:07:06,581
Imagine, a whole lifetime...

964
01:07:06,752 --> 01:07:10,711
...full of hopes and dreams
and ambitions...

965
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:15,543
...being wiped out
by a 2-ounce accident like a bullet.

966
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:19,068
A bullet shot off
into space by anybody.

967
01:07:19,872 --> 01:07:22,944
And my head and that bullet
at the same place at the same time.

968
01:07:23,112 --> 01:07:25,626
Only, it wasn't a bullet that got me,
it was my nerves.

969
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:28,352
A month in a hospital,
a medical discharge.

970
01:07:29,632 --> 01:07:33,227
And when I came home that time,
there was no parties, no banners...

971
01:07:33,392 --> 01:07:34,950
...no picture in the newspaper.

972
01:07:35,112 --> 01:07:39,071
- So you ran away again.
- Yeah.

973
01:07:39,232 --> 01:07:41,951
And I finally made it to Hollywood.

974
01:07:42,112 --> 01:07:44,262
And failed again.

975
01:07:44,432 --> 01:07:46,104
That time.

976
01:07:47,552 --> 01:07:49,031
But not this time.

977
01:07:50,632 --> 01:07:54,068
Princess. Now, I've got a few things
to iron out right now.

978
01:07:54,232 --> 01:07:58,111
But tonight you give this big
press conference, see?

979
01:07:58,272 --> 01:08:01,230
You know, to tell the world about this
new discovery you signed up.

980
01:08:01,392 --> 01:08:03,189
The last thing I want is publicity.

981
01:08:03,352 --> 01:08:07,061
I know, but this will prove that
young talent is your real interest in life.

982
01:08:07,232 --> 01:08:08,870
Which it certainly is not.

983
01:08:09,032 --> 01:08:13,822
My real, my only, interest in life is me,
Alexandra Del Lago.

984
01:08:13,992 --> 01:08:16,506
Besides, a movie starring
our special talent...

985
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:20,665
...would be banned in all 50 states,
censored worldwide.

986
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:23,062
Princess, I am taking your car.

987
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,587
- Well, when will I see you?
- Wait here.

988
01:08:25,752 --> 01:08:28,630
I don't like waiting for anybody.

989
01:08:29,552 --> 01:08:31,270
Baby.

990
01:08:38,592 --> 01:08:40,822
Morning, Miss Finley.

991
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:42,266
What is it, sergeant?

992
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:43,785
Nothing, miss.

993
01:08:43,952 --> 01:08:45,863
Just sort of spying?

994
01:08:46,032 --> 01:08:49,024
No, ma'am. Just sort of
watching over you.

995
01:08:49,192 --> 01:08:51,945
Easter must be a very dangerous time.

996
01:08:52,112 --> 01:08:54,023
Guess so, miss.

997
01:08:56,992 --> 01:08:59,984
- The ladies ready for church?
- Miss Nonnie's already gone, sir.

998
01:09:00,152 --> 01:09:02,620
- She took a taxi.
- I see.

999
01:09:03,032 --> 01:09:05,262
- She get any calls this morning?
- The phone rang.

1000
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:06,911
She talked to somebody.

1001
01:09:07,072 --> 01:09:09,142
No, sir, Mr. Finley.
I don't know who to.

1002
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,904
Get my Bible.

1003
01:09:14,592 --> 01:09:15,581
Good morning.

1004
01:09:16,672 --> 01:09:19,061
Nice morning, Mr. Finley.

1005
01:09:19,592 --> 01:09:23,062
Thank you, laddie.
You look mighty sweet, sugar.

1006
01:09:23,232 --> 01:09:26,224
I would like you to call off
your bloodhound, Papa.

1007
01:09:26,392 --> 01:09:28,952
I would like you to behave
like a daughter should.

1008
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:34,227
Well, did you meditate
on Mr. Wayne's future?

1009
01:09:34,392 --> 01:09:36,110
At the present, he is enjoying life...

1010
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:40,390
...in the loving arms
of a famous Hollywood siren.

1011
01:09:42,152 --> 01:09:45,667
Hey, Pa, if Chance is living
with a real princess...

1012
01:09:45,832 --> 01:09:47,629
...does that make him royalty too?

1013
01:09:47,792 --> 01:09:51,387
It makes him what he always was:
A criminal degenerate and parasite.

1014
01:09:51,552 --> 01:09:53,383
Oh, I see.

1015
01:10:25,472 --> 01:10:27,144
Chance?

1016
01:10:35,032 --> 01:10:38,581
She never blamed you for anything.

1017
01:10:39,312 --> 01:10:41,621
She always had...

1018
01:10:41,792 --> 01:10:43,350
Nothing.

1019
01:10:45,632 --> 01:10:48,066
I gave her nothing, Aunt Nonnie.

1020
01:10:49,432 --> 01:10:52,742
She lived Ionely and she died Ionely.

1021
01:10:56,392 --> 01:10:57,950
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

1022
01:10:59,272 --> 01:11:01,308
I came here to tell you one thing.

1023
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:03,861
Well, I was sort of hoping
that you'd bring Heavenly.

1024
01:11:04,032 --> 01:11:06,262
Go away before is too late.
Before her father...

1025
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:09,629
Why won't they let me see her,
Aunt Nonnie? Because she and George...?

1026
01:11:09,792 --> 01:11:11,384
- I can't talk about it.
- Why?

1027
01:11:13,312 --> 01:11:16,145
Why? Now, why, Aunt Nonnie?

1028
01:11:16,312 --> 01:11:18,780
I just can't talk about it.

1029
01:11:18,952 --> 01:11:21,466
Please. Please help me, Aunt Nonnie.

1030
01:11:21,632 --> 01:11:23,588
You were always able to...

1031
01:11:23,992 --> 01:11:26,028
See, you were like a mother to me.

1032
01:11:26,192 --> 01:11:30,071
You always called me son.
Why did you stop calling me son?

1033
01:11:30,232 --> 01:11:33,907
Oh, Chance, go away
before is too late.

1034
01:11:34,072 --> 01:11:36,870
I am not leaving here
till I talk to Heavenly or see her.

1035
01:11:37,032 --> 01:11:40,991
Now, you tell her that.
Aunt Nonnie, I got a right.

1036
01:11:47,552 --> 01:11:49,508
Goodbye, son.

1037
01:11:51,712 --> 01:11:52,986
Aunt Nonnie.

1038
01:11:54,952 --> 01:11:57,546
- Aunt Nonnie, I'm taking you to church.
- No, Chance.

1039
01:11:59,232 --> 01:12:03,908
I'm afraid. Afraid for you.

1040
01:12:22,752 --> 01:12:24,743
Take your sister on in.

1041
01:12:32,192 --> 01:12:34,422
- Happy Easter.
- Happy Easter, mayor.

1042
01:12:34,592 --> 01:12:38,062
Well, look here.
Glad to see you, laddie.

1043
01:12:38,232 --> 01:12:40,985
Hold it, Mr. Finley. Thank you, sir.

1044
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:42,426
Is no use, Mr. Finley, l...

1045
01:12:42,592 --> 01:12:46,062
Laddie, I hear you're consorting
with a genuine princess.

1046
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:49,144
Guess that sort of makes you a prince,
don't it?

1047
01:12:49,312 --> 01:12:50,904
Happy Easter, Mrs. Cavanaugh.

1048
01:12:51,072 --> 01:12:52,710
Well, God bless you, Mr. Finley.

1049
01:12:52,872 --> 01:12:54,749
I once had a dog called Prince.

1050
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:58,143
I had to butcher him to keep all
the bitches in town from being violated.

1051
01:12:58,312 --> 01:13:00,587
Deacon, I'm counting on your
support at the rally.

1052
01:13:00,752 --> 01:13:03,027
- Up, the rebels!
- Les see, now.

1053
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:05,945
- When did you last visit us?
- Why won't you let me see her, sir?

1054
01:13:06,112 --> 01:13:09,707
I remember, you hit town last time
in a freight car.

1055
01:13:09,872 --> 01:13:12,432
You saw my daughter then...

1056
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:16,790
...and you left her
carrying your bastard then too.

1057
01:13:16,952 --> 01:13:18,271
Let you see her?

1058
01:13:18,432 --> 01:13:23,665
Sure, prince, when I've had you
taken care of like my dog.

1059
01:14:10,192 --> 01:14:15,107
<i>I remember, you hit town last time
in a freight car.</i>

1060
01:15:34,272 --> 01:15:35,830
No, I'll get you dirty.

1061
01:15:35,992 --> 01:15:41,385
Hold me. Just hold me. Hold me.

1062
01:15:52,952 --> 01:15:54,704
What are you thinking?

1063
01:15:58,152 --> 01:16:03,067
I was just... I was just feeling
kind of peaceful and easy...

1064
01:16:03,232 --> 01:16:06,463
...listening to those freewheeling birds
coming home.

1065
01:16:07,792 --> 01:16:11,580
If we could just be like one of them
out there, just free as a bird.

1066
01:16:11,752 --> 01:16:15,506
No one in love is free
or even wants to be.

1067
01:16:16,312 --> 01:16:18,109
You know what I was thinking?

1068
01:16:21,392 --> 01:16:24,987
About those five days and nights
on those freight cars.

1069
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:29,870
Thinking that, "Heavenly will make me
feel clean again.

1070
01:16:30,032 --> 01:16:32,592
<i>She'll wash away all the..."</i>

1071
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:39,269
<i>Whas it like...</i>

1072
01:16:39,832 --> 01:16:41,470
...in movie land?

1073
01:16:41,632 --> 01:16:45,102
Oh, it is like no place
in this world, baby.

1074
01:16:47,032 --> 01:16:49,592
<i>In fact, is not even a place,
is a state of mind...</i>

1075
01:16:49,752 --> 01:16:51,982
...with a stone wall around it
a mile high.

1076
01:16:52,152 --> 01:16:54,302
"Strange birds, keep out."

1077
01:16:54,472 --> 01:16:57,464
No, is the strange ones that get in.
I know.

1078
01:16:57,632 --> 01:16:59,748
Why, I've been clawing away
at that wall...

1079
01:16:59,912 --> 01:17:02,631
...for over a year now,
trying to get on the inside.

1080
01:17:02,792 --> 01:17:04,623
<i>This last year's been...</i>

1081
01:17:05,992 --> 01:17:07,710
- Wasted?
- No.

1082
01:17:07,872 --> 01:17:09,942
No, just a run of bad breaks,
back-to-back.

1083
01:17:10,112 --> 01:17:14,549
Nothing's wasted that teaches you
how to operate, how to beat the game.

1084
01:17:15,072 --> 01:17:18,189
Last year's the best investment
I ever made.

1085
01:17:18,352 --> 01:17:20,183
Oh, next time I'm gonna get lucky.

1086
01:17:20,352 --> 01:17:23,424
And then I'm gonna
take you with me...

1087
01:17:23,592 --> 01:17:26,664
...right through that stone wall,
first class, straight to the top.

1088
01:17:26,832 --> 01:17:28,026
Again, Chance?

1089
01:17:28,192 --> 01:17:30,262
I got the key now, baby.

1090
01:17:30,432 --> 01:17:34,505
I got the know-how. That Hollywood
merry-go-round is a pushover.

1091
01:17:34,672 --> 01:17:37,982
Today they're stepping on your feet,
tomorrow they're kissing your feet.

1092
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:39,710
I know, I have seen it. Well...

1093
01:17:39,872 --> 01:17:42,432
...that merry-go-round
is gonna carry me.

1094
01:17:42,592 --> 01:17:45,948
Is gonna carry me all the way.

1095
01:17:46,272 --> 01:17:49,662
And then before you know it,
before you know it...

1096
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:53,029
<i>...I'm gonna have that brass ring,
that lucky brass ring right here.</i>

1097
01:17:53,192 --> 01:17:56,070
- Which gets you what?
- It gets you the prize...

1098
01:17:56,232 --> 01:17:57,745
...honey, money, success, happiness.

1099
01:17:57,912 --> 01:18:01,587
No. All the brass ring gets you
is a free ride on a wooden horse...

1100
01:18:01,752 --> 01:18:05,222
...thas going nowhere except
up and down and round and round.

1101
01:18:05,392 --> 01:18:07,064
My papa sold you that phony dream...

1102
01:18:07,232 --> 01:18:09,621
<i>...and you're still buying it.
How does he say it?</i>

1103
01:18:09,792 --> 01:18:12,511
"All you need is one lucky break.
Something for nothing.

1104
01:18:12,672 --> 01:18:14,390
Beat the game, hit the jackpot."

1105
01:18:14,552 --> 01:18:18,101
Anyone can be a millionaire,
so everybody's got to try it.

1106
01:18:18,272 --> 01:18:20,945
Thas right. And why not?

1107
01:18:21,112 --> 01:18:24,582
There are a lot of ways you can make it,
and for me there is one quick way.

1108
01:18:24,752 --> 01:18:27,585
Now, just stick with me, baby,
and when I come back next time...

1109
01:18:27,752 --> 01:18:30,949
- Another next time.
- No, this time I got a job.

1110
01:18:31,112 --> 01:18:35,071
I got a big job in Palm Beach mixing
with all kinds of important people.

1111
01:18:35,232 --> 01:18:37,985
Take me with you. Please.

1112
01:18:38,152 --> 01:18:39,949
No, I can't, baby. Not yet.

1113
01:18:40,112 --> 01:18:42,228
You know, in this job,
I gotta travel fast.

1114
01:18:42,392 --> 01:18:44,667
And I gotta travel alone.
This is the job, baby.

1115
01:18:44,832 --> 01:18:48,586
This is the job thas gonna get me
inside that magic door.

1116
01:18:49,352 --> 01:18:53,186
All my life, I've been on the outside.
And time is running out.

1117
01:18:53,352 --> 01:18:56,549
Now, look around you. Boy, they got
places for the old and the sick...

1118
01:18:56,712 --> 01:18:59,067
...and the homeless,
but no place for the failures.

1119
01:18:59,232 --> 01:19:02,941
And failure is
a highly contagious disease.

1120
01:19:03,712 --> 01:19:05,668
What kind of job is it, Chance?

1121
01:19:05,832 --> 01:19:09,188
- Oh, baby, it is golden. Just gold...
- Chance.

1122
01:19:11,579 --> 01:19:13,137
Beach boy.

1123
01:19:15,659 --> 01:19:18,093
To a bunch of fat-bottomed
broads at this swank hotel.

1124
01:19:18,259 --> 01:19:20,648
- But is a beginning.
- Stay here. We'll find something.

1125
01:19:20,819 --> 01:19:23,208
Baby, I can't. Have you forgotten
whas expected of me?

1126
01:19:23,379 --> 01:19:24,653
I want you as you are.

1127
01:19:24,819 --> 01:19:27,049
Then look at me as I am.
I'm a nothing.

1128
01:19:28,179 --> 01:19:29,851
A nobody.

1129
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:33,618
I couldn't write a check for $2
without getting arrested.

1130
01:19:33,779 --> 01:19:36,009
Busted. Flat broke.

1131
01:19:37,579 --> 01:19:40,332
I'm ashamed to go home
and let my mother look at me.

1132
01:19:40,499 --> 01:19:45,448
I always dreamed of
coming back here like a...

1133
01:19:46,259 --> 01:19:48,090
Oh, like...

1134
01:19:50,259 --> 01:19:53,092
Don't ask me to give up my dream.

1135
01:20:06,819 --> 01:20:08,377
Excuse me.

1136
01:20:21,499 --> 01:20:23,455
Supposing he comes over, Pa.

1137
01:20:23,619 --> 01:20:25,052
Well, sugar, is up to you.

1138
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:26,891
Let him alone.

1139
01:20:27,859 --> 01:20:31,454
I'll be there with you tonight.
Just let him alone.

1140
01:20:46,419 --> 01:20:49,729
- I want him gone before the rally starts.
- Yes, sir.

1141
01:20:49,899 --> 01:20:53,016
Not here, stupid. See him alone.
He's to go quietly.

1142
01:20:53,179 --> 01:20:55,249
No fuss. No violence, you hear?

1143
01:20:55,419 --> 01:20:56,852
Yes, sir. You're the boss, Pa.

1144
01:20:57,019 --> 01:20:58,896
And don't you ever forget it.

1145
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:00,651
No, sir.

1146
01:21:04,139 --> 01:21:06,494
Does this lovely hotel
have a hairdresser?

1147
01:21:06,659 --> 01:21:09,412
Oh, yes, ma'am. And a drugstore,
a cocktail bar...

1148
01:21:09,579 --> 01:21:12,013
...tennis courts,
everything to make folks happy.

1149
01:21:12,179 --> 01:21:13,931
Thank you.

1150
01:21:17,099 --> 01:21:18,612
Chance?

1151
01:21:19,979 --> 01:21:21,810
Long who?

1152
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:23,856
Long distance?

1153
01:21:25,099 --> 01:21:28,409
There is no Alexandra Del Lago here,
operator.

1154
01:21:28,579 --> 01:21:29,853
Who is it?

1155
01:21:30,019 --> 01:21:31,850
I am not...!

1156
01:21:32,459 --> 01:21:35,815
Operator, I ought to know who I am.

1157
01:21:35,979 --> 01:21:38,652
Just a minute. Just a minute.

1158
01:21:45,499 --> 01:21:47,535
- Chan...
- Excuse me, princess...

1159
01:21:47,699 --> 01:21:50,611
Whatever you are selling, no.

1160
01:21:50,779 --> 01:21:52,212
Excuse me, please.

1161
01:21:52,379 --> 01:21:55,132
I'm sorry, ma'am, but we can't hold
these rooms any longer.

1162
01:21:55,299 --> 01:21:56,812
What did you say?

1163
01:21:57,299 --> 01:21:59,017
Will you repeat what you said.

1164
01:21:59,179 --> 01:22:02,330
Ma'am, he says your checkout time
is long past.

1165
01:22:02,499 --> 01:22:07,448
My checkout time at any hotel
in the world is when l...

1166
01:22:07,619 --> 01:22:10,053
Is when I want to check out.

1167
01:22:10,219 --> 01:22:13,052
Who told you you could
come into my bedroom?

1168
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:15,938
- Now, where is Chance? Mr. Wayne?
- I beg your pardon?

1169
01:22:16,099 --> 01:22:18,818
- Your companion. Now, where is he?
- Who wants to know?

1170
01:22:18,979 --> 01:22:21,539
This is the assistant manager,
and I am Tom Finley Jr.

1171
01:22:21,699 --> 01:22:23,815
Well, I hardly imagined
that you were a senior.

1172
01:22:23,979 --> 01:22:26,413
Out, both of you.

1173
01:22:26,579 --> 01:22:29,776
Hatcher, better wait for me
downstairs, please.

1174
01:22:29,939 --> 01:22:33,409
- Now, Miss Del Lago...
- I am the Princess Kosmonopolis...

1175
01:22:34,219 --> 01:22:35,698
Shut up.

1176
01:22:36,179 --> 01:22:40,092
Miss Del Lago, you ought to be
more careful of the company you keep.

1177
01:22:40,819 --> 01:22:42,537
Operator.

1178
01:22:43,139 --> 01:22:45,858
Op... Just a moment, please.

1179
01:22:46,019 --> 01:22:47,930
Do you want me to call the police?

1180
01:22:48,099 --> 01:22:51,375
All right, you go ahead.
Do that, Miss Del Lago.

1181
01:22:51,779 --> 01:22:56,933
You tell them you spent the night
in an orgy with a criminal degenerate.

1182
01:23:01,579 --> 01:23:04,093
No, hon. Never mind.

1183
01:23:05,459 --> 01:23:08,417
Now, knowing him,
I figure you were victimized.

1184
01:23:08,579 --> 01:23:10,934
You're a rich, famous,
respected person, princess.

1185
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:12,532
You don't want any trouble.

1186
01:23:12,699 --> 01:23:13,973
Thank you.

1187
01:23:14,139 --> 01:23:16,528
And now, if you are through
trying to frighten me...

1188
01:23:16,699 --> 01:23:19,930
...or shake me down, or whatever,
I would like to finish my breakfast.

1189
01:23:20,099 --> 01:23:21,452
Yes, ma'am. Go right ahead.

1190
01:23:21,619 --> 01:23:23,371
May I ask you
what Mr. Wayne is to you?

1191
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:25,097
You may not.

1192
01:23:34,979 --> 01:23:40,531
<i>He's... He drives my car.
He's in my employ. He's my driver.</i>

1193
01:23:40,699 --> 01:23:42,451
What are you doing here in St. Cloud?

1194
01:23:43,699 --> 01:23:45,929
Okay, he brought you here. Why?

1195
01:23:46,099 --> 01:23:47,737
We're just passing through.

1196
01:23:47,899 --> 01:23:50,811
- Thas all.
- Well, fine. Just pass right on through.

1197
01:23:50,979 --> 01:23:53,447
But you tell that scum
to drive you out of here quick.

1198
01:23:54,019 --> 01:23:56,249
- On whose authority?
- Mine.

1199
01:23:56,419 --> 01:24:01,129
Well, even in this impossible place,
you couldn't represent the law.

1200
01:24:01,539 --> 01:24:04,007
There isn't any law
that covers the Chance Waynes.

1201
01:24:04,619 --> 01:24:07,372
Not after what he did to me
and to my family.

1202
01:24:07,539 --> 01:24:08,733
- What?
- You just never mind.

1203
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:10,412
- What did he do?
- Never you mind.

1204
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:13,093
<i>You tell him that I said
if he don't pass through...</i>

1205
01:24:13,259 --> 01:24:15,853
<i>...his life ain't worth spit in the wind.</i>

1206
01:24:19,979 --> 01:24:22,812
Well, sometime you come on back
and see us, hear?

1207
01:24:22,979 --> 01:24:24,970
We'll lay out the red carpet for you.

1208
01:24:25,579 --> 01:24:27,012
Okay?

1209
01:24:27,739 --> 01:24:29,616
Well, so long, Miss Del Lago.

1210
01:24:31,859 --> 01:24:35,374
Nightfall. Now, you and him
be gone by nightfall.

1211
01:24:35,539 --> 01:24:37,211
You hear me?

1212
01:25:04,379 --> 01:25:08,338
Oh, where? Where did he put it?

1213
01:25:09,659 --> 01:25:11,012
Where?

1214
01:25:14,299 --> 01:25:16,494
Oh, Chance.

1215
01:25:18,139 --> 01:25:19,857
Chance.

1216
01:25:21,139 --> 01:25:23,175
Operator.

1217
01:25:23,339 --> 01:25:27,696
Operator. I want a bottle of vodka
sent up here at once.

1218
01:25:27,859 --> 01:25:30,851
Yes. Well, then send me
a bottle of anything.

1219
01:25:31,019 --> 01:25:32,293
And operator?

1220
01:25:32,459 --> 01:25:36,338
Operator, I want you to find
Mr. Chance Wayne for me.

1221
01:25:36,739 --> 01:25:38,730
Well, page him.

1222
01:25:38,899 --> 01:25:42,938
And try that happy
cocktail bar of yours.

1223
01:25:44,739 --> 01:25:46,855
- Change for a quarter.
- Thank you.

1224
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:53,298
Did you arrange to have that
prescription filled yet?

1225
01:25:53,459 --> 01:25:55,051
I'll check, Mr. Wayne.

1226
01:25:58,739 --> 01:26:01,014
Hello? Professor Smith?

1227
01:26:01,539 --> 01:26:05,498
You can't beat Boss Finley
by making speeches about God...

1228
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:08,014
...or by heckling him about chastity...

1229
01:26:08,179 --> 01:26:11,057
...because the Boss has a patent
on that jazz.

1230
01:26:11,219 --> 01:26:13,335
He's a low-down hillbilly.

1231
01:26:13,499 --> 01:26:18,209
And it takes a hillbilly to cut down
a hillbilly, and thas me.

1232
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:21,772
Don't bother about my name.

1233
01:26:21,939 --> 01:26:26,569
You just appear at that rally tonight
and ask him one question:

1234
01:26:27,059 --> 01:26:32,816
Why did Boss Finley make Dr. Scudder
chief of staff at the hospital?

1235
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,812
Operator, are there any calls
for a Chance Wayne?

1236
01:26:37,419 --> 01:26:39,216
No, I mean outside calls.

1237
01:26:39,379 --> 01:26:41,131
Well, page me if there are, will you?

1238
01:26:41,299 --> 01:26:43,893
Chance?
Chance "High-Stepping" Wayne.

1239
01:26:44,059 --> 01:26:45,617
Hey, hey, Miss Lucy.

1240
01:26:45,779 --> 01:26:50,011
Honey, you used to be so attractive,
I couldn't stand it.

1241
01:26:50,179 --> 01:26:54,058
Now I can. Almost stand it.

1242
01:26:54,219 --> 01:26:57,609
Well, boy, you still look like
a million dollars, there, Miss Lucy.

1243
01:26:57,779 --> 01:26:59,770
Confederate money.

1244
01:27:00,499 --> 01:27:03,411
Hey, a year ago you would have
laughed at that.

1245
01:27:03,579 --> 01:27:06,013
- Well, I must be faint with thirst.
- Thirsty? Here?

1246
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:09,694
Don't you know this is the land of
Bourbon, Sodom and Gomorrah Finley?

1247
01:27:09,859 --> 01:27:12,134
- Can I help you, Miss Lucy?
- Yeah. Drop dead.

1248
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:13,778
What happened to your finger?

1249
01:27:13,939 --> 01:27:17,614
It got caught in your big,
fat blabbermouth.

1250
01:27:17,779 --> 01:27:19,576
Hey, honey, you wanna laugh?

1251
01:27:19,739 --> 01:27:24,017
Listen. Last night, Finley gave me this
for an Easter gift.

1252
01:27:24,179 --> 01:27:27,012
Well, he has always been generous.

1253
01:27:27,179 --> 01:27:28,692
Well, thas not all he gave me.

1254
01:27:28,859 --> 01:27:31,578
He gave me the treatment,
the full Finley treatment.

1255
01:27:31,739 --> 01:27:35,288
Ending up canceling my rooms,
my credit and my welcome.

1256
01:27:35,459 --> 01:27:39,054
And this morning, I was handed a ticket
to New Orleans. One way.

1257
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:44,293
Well, that man has an irresistible passion
to see other people traveling.

1258
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:46,575
Does he know you're back in town?

1259
01:27:46,739 --> 01:27:49,173
I would say he is
aware of my presence.

1260
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:52,017
Whas in the pill, honey?

1261
01:27:52,179 --> 01:27:55,410
Well, when you are having fun,
this makes you have even more.

1262
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,895
Are you? Having fun?

1263
01:27:59,059 --> 01:28:01,129
Baby, I'm having a ball.

1264
01:28:03,299 --> 01:28:07,929
Honey, I'm an expert
at pretending to have fun.

1265
01:28:08,099 --> 01:28:11,375
You are having a wake, not a ball.

1266
01:28:11,539 --> 01:28:14,258
Mr. Wayne? Phone, Mr. Wayne.

1267
01:28:19,899 --> 01:28:21,855
Isn't that Alexandra Del Lago?

1268
01:28:22,899 --> 01:28:24,332
Who?

1269
01:28:26,299 --> 01:28:29,496
Oh, Aunt Nonnie.
Yeah, is me, chance.

1270
01:28:29,659 --> 01:28:32,492
Miss Del Lago, will you
autograph this for me, please?

1271
01:28:32,659 --> 01:28:36,095
- I'm sorry.
- Not for me, for my little girl.

1272
01:28:36,979 --> 01:28:40,494
- Just write, "To my dearest Josephine."
- I'm looking for my glasses.

1273
01:28:41,139 --> 01:28:42,936
- Miss Del Lago, please.
- Some other time.

1274
01:28:43,099 --> 01:28:46,171
<i>- Tell Heavenly that I will be there.
- You shouldn't be seen here...</i>

1275
01:28:46,339 --> 01:28:48,330
...in this condition.
- Chance. Chance!

1276
01:28:54,899 --> 01:28:56,491
Get this drunken bum out of here.

1277
01:28:56,659 --> 01:28:58,809
Hey, hey, relax!

1278
01:28:59,939 --> 01:29:01,452
Relax, buster.

1279
01:29:01,619 --> 01:29:03,052
Chance.

1280
01:29:04,699 --> 01:29:07,532
- You all right, princess?
- Oh, Chance.

1281
01:29:08,619 --> 01:29:11,133
If you'd stayed upstairs,
that would not have happened.

1282
01:29:11,299 --> 01:29:13,654
- Oh, I did. I stayed.
- I told you to wait.

1283
01:29:13,819 --> 01:29:17,289
I waited. I waited forever.
But then a young man...

1284
01:29:17,459 --> 01:29:19,529
Princess, not now.
I've gotta do something.

1285
01:29:19,699 --> 01:29:21,610
Will you just wait upstairs?

1286
01:29:21,779 --> 01:29:22,973
Chance.

1287
01:29:23,499 --> 01:29:25,888
Chance, listen to me.
We've got to go away from here.

1288
01:29:26,059 --> 01:29:27,777
Princess, please, I haven't got time.

1289
01:29:27,939 --> 01:29:30,373
We'll just pretend that we're going
for a drive.

1290
01:29:30,539 --> 01:29:32,894
- Yeah, but...
- We'll forget about the bags.

1291
01:29:33,059 --> 01:29:35,619
I had a visitor, looking for you.

1292
01:29:35,779 --> 01:29:39,215
He was a horrible, vicious young man
with evil in his heart.

1293
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:43,054
<i>And he said that if we weren't
out of town by nightfall, he'd...</i>

1294
01:29:43,219 --> 01:29:45,210
Oh, chance, I didn't know
where to find you.

1295
01:29:45,379 --> 01:29:48,496
And at first I felt panicky,
and then I got a little high again.

1296
01:29:48,659 --> 01:29:50,377
- I'm sorry.
- Look, I know, princess...

1297
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:52,530
...but I gotta go now.
- Oh, Chance.

1298
01:29:52,699 --> 01:29:55,577
Chance, Chance, let me tell you.

1299
01:29:55,739 --> 01:29:58,890
Let me tell you the strange and
wonderful thing that happened to me.

1300
01:29:59,059 --> 01:30:03,291
<i>I realized that your coming back here
and the things that you'd hoped for...</i>

1301
01:30:03,459 --> 01:30:08,897
...poor baby, I knew that your comeback
had been a failure, like my own.

1302
01:30:09,059 --> 01:30:14,736
And at that moment,
I felt something in my heart for you.

1303
01:30:14,899 --> 01:30:19,290
Is a miracle. Is a wonderful thing
that has happened to me.

1304
01:30:19,459 --> 01:30:23,008
I felt something for somebody
besides myself.

1305
01:30:23,179 --> 01:30:24,737
You know what that means?

1306
01:30:24,899 --> 01:30:29,814
That means that my heart is still alive.
Still alive, Chance.

1307
01:30:30,699 --> 01:30:32,815
Well, you've got a wise heart,
princess.

1308
01:30:33,939 --> 01:30:36,897
Oh, I need you.
And we need each other.

1309
01:30:37,059 --> 01:30:40,972
We'll help each other.
You won't find me ungrateful.

1310
01:30:41,139 --> 01:30:45,291
Chance, I am truly ashamed
of last night.

1311
01:30:45,459 --> 01:30:49,577
I will never degrade you...

1312
01:30:49,739 --> 01:30:51,092
...nor myself.

1313
01:30:51,259 --> 01:30:54,012
I understand. Now, please, princess.

1314
01:30:54,179 --> 01:30:55,373
You want a screen test?

1315
01:30:58,939 --> 01:31:01,453
You'll have your test.
I'll honor that contract.

1316
01:31:01,619 --> 01:31:03,849
I'll make it good.
I'll make it even better.

1317
01:31:04,019 --> 01:31:08,171
Oh, princess, you are a glorious,
beautiful, lovely...

1318
01:31:08,339 --> 01:31:11,536
Monster. Drive, baby, drive.

1319
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:14,213
Break every speed law from here...

1320
01:31:16,499 --> 01:31:18,455
No. No, baby.

1321
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:22,612
- Princess, I got unfinished business.
- Don't leave me again. Not now.

1322
01:31:22,779 --> 01:31:24,531
- I got to.
- Chance!

1323
01:31:25,179 --> 01:31:27,010
Chance.

1324
01:31:30,939 --> 01:31:34,409
Chance, you'll never come back.
They'll cut the life out of you.

1325
01:31:34,579 --> 01:31:38,891
- Princess, go up to the room and wait.
- No, please. Please, baby.

1326
01:31:39,059 --> 01:31:40,492
I can't be alone now.

1327
01:31:40,659 --> 01:31:43,332
Don't ask me to stay. Please.

1328
01:31:43,499 --> 01:31:45,057
Just give me this one last break.

1329
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:49,451
Oh, Chance. Chance. Chance!

1330
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,688
Don't send me back
to that room alone.

1331
01:31:57,859 --> 01:31:59,850
We could both do
with some comfort, honey.

1332
01:32:00,019 --> 01:32:02,692
Southern Comfort, 100 proof?

1333
01:32:02,859 --> 01:32:04,178
Thank you, miss.

1334
01:32:04,339 --> 01:32:07,172
Give the hicks a show, miss.

1335
01:32:07,339 --> 01:32:12,333
You show them you're a real princess.
Is good public relations.

1336
01:32:12,499 --> 01:32:18,256
Public? The public and I have always
enjoyed the very best relations.

1337
01:32:26,219 --> 01:32:27,811
Hi there.

1338
01:32:28,859 --> 01:32:32,647
Wouldn't you like to have a nice,
cool dip before lunch?

1339
01:32:40,219 --> 01:32:42,938
- Don't you go away, now.
- No, ma'am.

1340
01:33:11,059 --> 01:33:12,253
No.

1341
01:33:12,419 --> 01:33:15,331
Dear, she shouldn't have gone anywhere
without you, should she?

1342
01:33:15,499 --> 01:33:16,978
No, ma'am, she shouldn't have.

1343
01:33:58,059 --> 01:34:02,098
Go away, Chance. Go away.
Leave here. Leave St. Cloud.

1344
01:34:02,259 --> 01:34:05,296
- Well, yeah, we'll leave here together.
- Is too late for that.

1345
01:34:05,459 --> 01:34:08,417
Baby, is just the beginning for us.

1346
01:34:08,579 --> 01:34:12,128
Now, no more next time.
This time, is for keeps.

1347
01:34:13,219 --> 01:34:14,857
We got it made, baby.

1348
01:34:15,019 --> 01:34:19,217
This is my passport out of here.
Right to the top, nonstop.

1349
01:34:19,419 --> 01:34:21,216
Let go, Chance.

1350
01:34:21,379 --> 01:34:22,607
Let go of my life.

1351
01:34:23,379 --> 01:34:26,928
But, baby, the door is opened.
This is a contract!

1352
01:34:27,379 --> 01:34:30,496
Now, is witnessed and notarized
and signed by Alexandra Del Lago.

1353
01:34:30,659 --> 01:34:34,254
She's my patroness.
She's my agent, my producer.

1354
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,613
This is on the level.

1355
01:34:35,779 --> 01:34:37,929
- You've gotta believe me!
- I believe you.

1356
01:34:38,099 --> 01:34:40,090
All right, then. We'll leave here.
Together.

1357
01:34:40,259 --> 01:34:43,376
You and me and Princess Del Lago.
Tonight. Whenever you say.

1358
01:34:43,539 --> 01:34:45,450
Take your princess and go away.

1359
01:34:45,619 --> 01:34:48,292
Now. Before tonight.

1360
01:34:48,459 --> 01:34:50,177
You want me
to leave here without you?

1361
01:34:50,339 --> 01:34:52,216
Don't come back.

1362
01:34:52,379 --> 01:34:54,609
Don't call anymore. Run!

1363
01:34:54,779 --> 01:34:57,930
But, baby, what about you?
What about you and me?

1364
01:34:58,099 --> 01:35:00,055
Forget about me!

1365
01:35:00,219 --> 01:35:02,972
You want me to forget
that you're carrying my baby?

1366
01:35:03,139 --> 01:35:05,937
Yes! The way I had to forget!

1367
01:35:06,339 --> 01:35:08,409
Go back to your dream!

1368
01:35:33,059 --> 01:35:35,254
- You got the loudspeaker tested?
- Yeah.

1369
01:35:35,419 --> 01:35:37,774
- How about the TV setup? Okay?
- Yeah. Okay.

1370
01:35:40,459 --> 01:35:43,132
- I want you to stand by for a surprise.
- What kind of surprise?

1371
01:35:43,299 --> 01:35:46,097
I don't know. I got an anonymous
phone call, so just stand by.

1372
01:35:46,259 --> 01:35:48,011
Yes, ma'am, princess!

1373
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:51,251
Honey,
get the bill ready for suite 212.

1374
01:35:51,419 --> 01:35:54,889
- Miss Lucy, your bill's been paid in full.
- Thas what you think.

1375
01:36:04,259 --> 01:36:07,376
- Hold on.
- Tom Jr., they're checking out.

1376
01:36:07,539 --> 01:36:10,497
The princess lady
just asked for the bill.

1377
01:36:48,819 --> 01:36:50,935
Come here.
You just had to see him, didn't you?

1378
01:36:51,099 --> 01:36:54,250
You just naturally had to lay
in chance Wayne's arms like a trollop.

1379
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:07,378
Folks, my daughter!

1380
01:37:09,139 --> 01:37:11,778
Who says purity and politics
don't go together?

1381
01:37:29,779 --> 01:37:31,337
Well!

1382
01:37:31,539 --> 01:37:33,928
I thought,
from the happy celebration...

1383
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:38,934
...that you were being served on a platter
with an apple stuck in your mouth.

1384
01:37:40,699 --> 01:37:42,655
- What are you doing?
- Getting out of here.

1385
01:37:42,819 --> 01:37:46,414
- As fast as your car will take us.
- Oh, well. I have another driver.

1386
01:37:46,579 --> 01:37:48,854
A certain Miss Lucy.

1387
01:37:49,019 --> 01:37:52,694
A kindly soul who will drive me
out of this hellish nightmare...

1388
01:37:52,859 --> 01:37:54,338
...as far as New Orleans.

1389
01:37:54,499 --> 01:37:57,297
I'm still your driver, princess.
We're leaving here together.

1390
01:37:57,459 --> 01:38:00,337
What happened
to your unfinished business?

1391
01:38:00,499 --> 01:38:02,569
Floppola?

1392
01:38:05,739 --> 01:38:09,448
- Well, I'm back. Isn't that enough?
- In a word, no.

1393
01:38:11,939 --> 01:38:14,817
- Oh, princess, baby...
- No!

1394
01:38:15,699 --> 01:38:17,735
Don't answer that.

1395
01:38:17,899 --> 01:38:19,127
Chance!

1396
01:38:19,579 --> 01:38:20,978
- Hello?
- I told you not to.

1397
01:38:21,139 --> 01:38:24,051
- Who's calling the princess?
- Will you please, please hang up?

1398
01:38:24,219 --> 01:38:27,211
Is Walter Winchell, in Hollywood.

1399
01:38:28,019 --> 01:38:29,930
Oh, no.

1400
01:38:30,699 --> 01:38:32,496
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, put him on.

1401
01:38:32,659 --> 01:38:34,729
- No. No!
- Yeah, she's right here.

1402
01:38:34,899 --> 01:38:37,811
Oh, how did he find me? How?

1403
01:38:38,379 --> 01:38:40,654
- It was you.
- Hello? Hello, Mr. Winchell?

1404
01:38:40,819 --> 01:38:44,016
Oh, yes.
Well, this is Chance Wayne speaking.

1405
01:38:44,179 --> 01:38:45,931
I called for the
Princess Kosmonopolis.

1406
01:38:46,099 --> 01:38:47,373
Alexandra...!

1407
01:38:47,539 --> 01:38:49,689
I mean, Alexandra Del Lago.
Last night?

1408
01:38:49,859 --> 01:38:51,053
Oh, yeah. She's fine, fine.

1409
01:38:51,219 --> 01:38:54,768
She just wanted to tell you about
this new star that she's discovered.

1410
01:38:55,019 --> 01:38:57,214
- Oh, sure, she can talk for herself.
- I can't.

1411
01:38:57,379 --> 01:39:01,452
- Princess, come on. He's waiting.
- Well, you tell him that I am dying.

1412
01:39:01,619 --> 01:39:02,813
And I just might.

1413
01:39:02,979 --> 01:39:04,856
You gotta meet it halfway.

1414
01:39:07,579 --> 01:39:09,376
Princess?

1415
01:39:17,099 --> 01:39:18,851
Walter?

1416
01:39:20,459 --> 01:39:21,608
Walter?

1417
01:39:22,059 --> 01:39:26,849
Walter! Well, is that really you, Waldo?

1418
01:39:27,499 --> 01:39:31,128
Yes, yes, is me. Alexandra.

1419
01:39:31,299 --> 01:39:33,130
Thas whas left of me.

1420
01:39:33,499 --> 01:39:34,978
Walter?

1421
01:39:35,139 --> 01:39:38,654
Oh, yes, yes, I did go to the preview,
but I only stayed a few minutes.

1422
01:39:38,819 --> 01:39:45,054
As soon I saw that first big close-up of
myself on that monstrous CinemaScope...

1423
01:39:45,219 --> 01:39:47,130
...I tell you, I ran right out of there!

1424
01:39:47,299 --> 01:39:49,938
I screamed for a taxi,
and I haven't been...

1425
01:39:50,099 --> 01:39:52,135
I haven't stopped running since.

1426
01:39:52,499 --> 01:39:53,648
What?

1427
01:39:53,819 --> 01:39:59,018
Oh, no, no. No, no, I heard nothing,
read nothing, I just wanted oblivion.

1428
01:39:59,179 --> 01:40:00,817
What?

1429
01:40:02,579 --> 01:40:04,456
Walter.

1430
01:40:05,139 --> 01:40:07,130
You're just being kind, aren't you?

1431
01:40:07,299 --> 01:40:09,096
Princess, tell him
about my screen test.

1432
01:40:10,259 --> 01:40:14,047
- One moment, Walter, I'm breathless.
- Tell him to break it in his column...

1433
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:18,371
Go in the bathroom and stick
your head under cold water.

1434
01:40:18,539 --> 01:40:21,736
Walter, now, tell me,
do you really think so?

1435
01:40:21,899 --> 01:40:26,814
You're not just being kind,
are you, because of old times?

1436
01:40:27,539 --> 01:40:33,296
Grown, did you say? My talent?
Well, in what way, Walter?

1437
01:40:33,459 --> 01:40:34,858
- More depth?
- Tell him about me.

1438
01:40:35,019 --> 01:40:36,975
- More what? What did you say?
- Me.

1439
01:40:37,139 --> 01:40:38,572
More power?

1440
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:42,618
- Well, God bless you. God bless you!
- Come on, now, cut the chatter.

1441
01:40:42,779 --> 01:40:45,816
Tell him you've found a new
leading man with a bright new future.

1442
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:49,654
Walter, that is very,
very sweet of you.

1443
01:40:49,819 --> 01:40:53,858
I don't even care if you're not altogether
sincere in that statement, Walter...

1444
01:40:54,019 --> 01:40:58,695
...because I think you know what
the past 15 years have been like.

1445
01:40:58,859 --> 01:41:00,577
What?

1446
01:41:01,619 --> 01:41:04,179
Whas that, Walter?

1447
01:41:04,979 --> 01:41:07,174
They want me?

1448
01:41:09,939 --> 01:41:12,976
They really want me?

1449
01:41:13,979 --> 01:41:16,493
Well, for what part?

1450
01:41:16,659 --> 01:41:19,332
Who? Who wants me?

1451
01:41:23,099 --> 01:41:25,294
Oh, dear Lord.

1452
01:41:33,299 --> 01:41:35,529
Walter!

1453
01:41:36,179 --> 01:41:39,012
Walter, please excuse me.

1454
01:41:39,179 --> 01:41:42,649
No, no. Excuse me. I'm crying, dear,
and I haven't got any Kleenex.

1455
01:41:42,819 --> 01:41:44,537
Come on, talk to him about me.

1456
01:41:44,699 --> 01:41:46,849
- Oh, Walter...
- Me, me, me!

1457
01:41:47,499 --> 01:41:49,296
Walter, what?

1458
01:41:49,459 --> 01:41:51,450
No, no, I didn't read the reviews.

1459
01:41:51,619 --> 01:41:54,656
Newspapers.
Who cares what the newspapers say?

1460
01:41:54,819 --> 01:41:59,688
What did they say? Tell me.
Tell me word for word.

1461
01:42:09,539 --> 01:42:14,249
Before the festivities, let us all
bow our heads in silent prayer.

1462
01:42:14,419 --> 01:42:18,173
Mrs. Maribelle Norris
will sing while we pray.

1463
01:42:29,339 --> 01:42:30,533
Good night, professor.

1464
01:42:30,699 --> 01:42:32,655
Can't we do this
without hurting the girl?

1465
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,889
Do you wanna get rid
of Boss Finley or not?

1466
01:42:40,499 --> 01:42:42,854
Yes. Oh, no!

1467
01:42:43,019 --> 01:42:49,015
<i>Oh, Walter, the New Yorker magazine
praised it.</i>

1468
01:42:49,179 --> 01:42:53,934
Oh, I'm too overwhelmed. I'm...
Walter, I'll have to call you back later.

1469
01:42:54,099 --> 01:42:56,772
- I can't believe it. I can't believe it.
- Hello?

1470
01:42:56,939 --> 01:43:03,014
My picture has broken box-office records
in New York and L.A.

1471
01:43:03,179 --> 01:43:05,647
<i>- Get him back on this phone.
- Variety says...</i>

1472
01:43:05,819 --> 01:43:09,494
...that I am the biggest boff
in release today.

1473
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:12,776
- Princess, I took care of you.
- I've gotta go to a clinic for a week.

1474
01:43:12,939 --> 01:43:14,816
- I delivered my end.
- A week or 10 days.

1475
01:43:14,979 --> 01:43:17,129
Would you shut up and listen!

1476
01:43:17,299 --> 01:43:22,327
Bennie. I'll have to get him to cover up
my tracks these past few weeks in hell.

1477
01:43:22,499 --> 01:43:24,171
- Get Winchell back on this phone.
- What?

1478
01:43:24,339 --> 01:43:25,613
Tell him about me!

1479
01:43:25,779 --> 01:43:29,089
What? Tell him about a beach boy
that I picked up for pleasure...

1480
01:43:29,259 --> 01:43:31,136
...a distraction from panic?

1481
01:43:31,299 --> 01:43:34,848
Now? Now, when the
nightmare is over?

1482
01:43:35,019 --> 01:43:38,489
And involve my name
with the name of a...

1483
01:43:38,659 --> 01:43:40,650
A blackmailer.

1484
01:43:40,819 --> 01:43:43,094
You've just been using me. Using me.

1485
01:43:43,259 --> 01:43:47,696
When you ran out on me downstairs,
you ran out on this contract too.

1486
01:43:47,859 --> 01:43:53,855
Just a short while ago, I needed you.
Oh, how I needed you.

1487
01:43:54,019 --> 01:43:58,171
Well, now I need nobody.

1488
01:43:58,339 --> 01:43:59,692
I climbed up alone.

1489
01:43:59,859 --> 01:44:04,057
And I will climb back alone.
Back to where I belong.

1490
01:44:04,219 --> 01:44:08,337
I will live alone and I will work alone.

1491
01:44:08,499 --> 01:44:13,095
I know exactly the kind
of gold-plated hell I'm going to.

1492
01:44:13,259 --> 01:44:19,016
But you, you have gone past something
you couldn't afford to go past.

1493
01:44:19,179 --> 01:44:22,728
Your time, your youth.
You've passed it.

1494
01:44:22,899 --> 01:44:24,890
Is all you've had, and you've had it!

1495
01:44:25,059 --> 01:44:27,050
Look who's talking.

1496
01:44:27,219 --> 01:44:29,574
Just look at yourself.

1497
01:44:30,979 --> 01:44:33,732
What do you see in there?

1498
01:44:35,859 --> 01:44:38,214
I see me.

1499
01:44:38,379 --> 01:44:43,328
Alexandra Del Lago, artist and star.

1500
01:44:43,499 --> 01:44:45,615
Now you look at yourself.

1501
01:44:45,779 --> 01:44:47,417
What do you see?

1502
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:49,217
What?

1503
01:44:49,379 --> 01:44:53,452
A nameless face, thas what you see.
Oh, I remember faces like yours.

1504
01:44:53,859 --> 01:44:56,737
I remember young men
with dreams like yours.

1505
01:44:56,899 --> 01:44:59,493
I remember their eyes,
I remember their voices...

1506
01:44:59,659 --> 01:45:02,571
...I remember their smiles,
I remember their bodies.

1507
01:45:02,739 --> 01:45:07,051
But their names, their names have gone.
They're just nameless bodies.

1508
01:45:07,219 --> 01:45:09,130
Well, you remind me
of one in particular.

1509
01:45:09,299 --> 01:45:12,530
What was his name? Franz something.
Franz, Franz...

1510
01:45:12,979 --> 01:45:18,611
- Albertzart. Yes, Franz Albertzart.
- Are you through? Have you finished?

1511
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:22,488
I saw Franz a few years
later in Monte Carlo.

1512
01:45:22,659 --> 01:45:27,050
He was with a woman of 70,
and his eyes were older than hers.

1513
01:45:27,219 --> 01:45:28,811
But she held him.

1514
01:45:28,979 --> 01:45:33,097
She led him by an invisible chain
through a string of hotels...

1515
01:45:33,259 --> 01:45:37,457
...and casinos and bars
like a blind, obedient lap dog.

1516
01:45:37,939 --> 01:45:42,171
Chance Wayne is Franz Albertzart.

1517
01:45:45,179 --> 01:45:48,808
Oh, no. Look, I'm not Franz anybody.
Princess, I'm your next leading man.

1518
01:45:50,259 --> 01:45:54,855
Princess, now, look, you've gotta
open the right doors for me.

1519
01:45:55,019 --> 01:45:56,737
I know you're gonna do this for me.

1520
01:45:56,899 --> 01:46:00,369
I have been knocking on those doors
of success till my insides are bloody.

1521
01:46:00,539 --> 01:46:03,611
Thas how I've been knocking
on those doors, with my bare insides.

1522
01:46:03,779 --> 01:46:05,132
You will open only one door:

1523
01:46:05,299 --> 01:46:08,097
The door to my car as my chauffeur.

1524
01:46:08,259 --> 01:46:09,897
You will wake me in the morning...

1525
01:46:10,059 --> 01:46:13,688
...as my butler or my lover,
depending on what I want.

1526
01:46:13,859 --> 01:46:16,578
In a few years, you will be through
with your good looks...

1527
01:46:16,739 --> 01:46:18,491
...and I will be through with you.

1528
01:46:18,659 --> 01:46:21,696
And that is the truth.
Can you face the truth?

1529
01:46:22,099 --> 01:46:26,331
Are you ready to be my chauffeur?
My next Franz Albertzart?

1530
01:46:26,499 --> 01:46:28,729
Oh, don't you know I would die first?

1531
01:46:29,579 --> 01:46:32,651
I would. I would rather die first.

1532
01:46:34,579 --> 01:46:38,413
And here he is.
May the good Lord protect him.

1533
01:46:38,619 --> 01:46:40,735
Our Tom.

1534
01:46:49,099 --> 01:46:54,890
I am here to answer charges against
my good name and character.

1535
01:46:57,299 --> 01:46:59,688
Thirty years ago,
the voice of God told me...

1536
01:46:59,859 --> 01:47:02,134
...to save this sweet land
from pollution.

1537
01:47:02,299 --> 01:47:08,534
Well, I am here on the same
sacred mission tonight.

1538
01:47:09,259 --> 01:47:12,888
To save us from outsiders
who wanna corrupt our way of life.

1539
01:47:13,059 --> 01:47:14,253
Boss Finley!

1540
01:47:14,419 --> 01:47:16,808
Hey, Boss Finley!

1541
01:47:16,979 --> 01:47:19,368
What way of life you talking about?

1542
01:47:19,539 --> 01:47:21,609
You mean the way your daughter...

1543
01:47:21,779 --> 01:47:25,931
The way your virtuous Miss Heavenly
had a secret operation...

1544
01:47:26,099 --> 01:47:28,613
...at the hands of Dr. Scudder?
- What are you waiting for?

1545
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:32,567
An illegal operation,
performed in your hospital.

1546
01:47:32,739 --> 01:47:34,889
Aided and abetted by you.

1547
01:47:35,059 --> 01:47:38,495
- And forced on her without her consent.
- That is a dirty, black lie!

1548
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:41,127
- Did God tell you how to rob us blind?
- Show yourself!

1549
01:47:41,299 --> 01:47:45,451
- Listen to me, folks!
- How to use your office for gain?

1550
01:47:45,619 --> 01:47:48,372
- Listen to me!
- Come on, get him out of here!

1551
01:47:48,539 --> 01:47:51,576
I have dedicated my life to God,
home and country.

1552
01:47:52,259 --> 01:47:54,454
My life is an open book.

1553
01:47:55,059 --> 01:47:58,335
Listen to me, folks!
Folks, listen to me!

1554
01:48:05,339 --> 01:48:08,490
Chance, we're leaving.
Right now. Together.

1555
01:48:08,659 --> 01:48:12,174
Murderer! Baby killer!

1556
01:48:13,379 --> 01:48:15,415
I'm going to send a boy
up for my luggage.

1557
01:48:15,579 --> 01:48:18,093
You had better come down
with my luggage.

1558
01:48:18,259 --> 01:48:20,250
- I am not part of your luggage.
- Chance.

1559
01:48:20,419 --> 01:48:24,412
Whatever I am,
I am not part of your luggage.

1560
01:48:26,099 --> 01:48:30,251
All right. You know whas going
to happen to you if you stay.

1561
01:48:30,419 --> 01:48:32,330
Goodbye.

1562
01:48:35,979 --> 01:48:37,128
Chance.

1563
01:48:37,659 --> 01:48:42,096
<i>Chance, dear, I... Well, is...</i>

1564
01:48:43,419 --> 01:48:48,334
- You forget something, princess?
- Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1565
01:48:52,819 --> 01:48:55,538
- These, maybe?
- Oh, yes.

1566
01:48:56,299 --> 01:48:58,369
Of course, last night
they were worthless...

1567
01:48:58,539 --> 01:49:01,212
...but now, after my comeback...

1568
01:49:01,379 --> 01:49:05,213
...you know,
they're worth a small jackpot.

1569
01:49:05,379 --> 01:49:08,815
- In cash.
- On the house.

1570
01:49:09,459 --> 01:49:14,294
Chance. Please, let me help you.

1571
01:49:14,459 --> 01:49:16,654
- Goodbye, lover.
- At least let me take you away.

1572
01:49:16,819 --> 01:49:19,128
- And good luck.
- I'll wait for you in the car.

1573
01:49:19,299 --> 01:49:23,895
Princess, each of us has his own
private hell to go to.

1574
01:49:32,259 --> 01:49:33,851
- Find your sister.
- Take it easy, Pa.

1575
01:49:34,019 --> 01:49:36,010
She'll run off with that punk.

1576
01:49:36,179 --> 01:49:39,728
- No, he's gone. Checked out.
- That won't stop her.

1577
01:49:40,459 --> 01:49:42,177
Will you let me handle this?

1578
01:49:46,099 --> 01:49:47,373
Mr. Finley.

1579
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:49,211
How would you
answer the charges...?

1580
01:49:49,379 --> 01:49:52,132
I am shocked, shocked,
to find our state overrun...

1581
01:49:52,299 --> 01:49:55,177
...by backstabbing Bolsheviki
and Red rabble-rousers.

1582
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:56,818
Get the governor on the phone.

1583
01:49:56,979 --> 01:50:00,892
Are you aware it was the Finley Youth
Club hoodlums that started that riot?

1584
01:50:01,299 --> 01:50:02,493
What riot?

1585
01:50:02,659 --> 01:50:06,447
I'm only aware that decent Americans
were defending freedom of speech...

1586
01:50:06,619 --> 01:50:08,894
...which I have yet
to receive the benefit of.

1587
01:50:09,059 --> 01:50:11,778
Oh, Miss Finley,
would you care to make a statement?

1588
01:50:12,819 --> 01:50:14,969
- Miss Finley?
- Hasn't enough been said already?

1589
01:50:15,139 --> 01:50:19,849
Sure, Aunt Nonnie, folks will think
we got something to hide.

1590
01:50:20,779 --> 01:50:22,974
Sugar? Heavenly, baby.

1591
01:50:23,459 --> 01:50:26,656
Precious, your papa's talking to you.

1592
01:50:26,979 --> 01:50:28,651
You came here
of your own free will...

1593
01:50:28,819 --> 01:50:32,858
...and I hereby give you just as much
freedom to speak your piece, right now.

1594
01:50:33,219 --> 01:50:34,811
Take me home, Papa.

1595
01:50:34,979 --> 01:50:37,288
Good night, folks. Good night, you-all.

1596
01:50:46,419 --> 01:50:48,330
Heavenly!

1597
01:50:50,419 --> 01:50:52,091
Heavenly!

1598
01:50:54,179 --> 01:50:56,534
Mr. Chance, is me, charles.

1599
01:50:57,259 --> 01:50:59,375
Don't stay here, Mr. Chance. Don't!

1600
01:50:59,939 --> 01:51:01,895
Don't stay here.

1601
01:51:02,659 --> 01:51:04,536
Please, Mr. Chance,
don't stay here now.

1602
01:51:05,219 --> 01:51:07,255
Heavenly!

1603
01:51:22,819 --> 01:51:24,855
Well, lookie here.

1604
01:51:25,019 --> 01:51:29,649
Thought you'd be halfway to california
by now with that tramp actress of yours.

1605
01:51:30,459 --> 01:51:32,415
Heavenly!

1606
01:51:32,579 --> 01:51:36,128
Don't you ever speak the name
of my sister again.

1607
01:51:38,539 --> 01:51:40,655
Heavenly...

1608
01:51:43,059 --> 01:51:45,050
Heavenly!

1609
01:52:11,379 --> 01:52:13,017
- Don't you know?
- Kill him.

1610
01:52:13,179 --> 01:52:17,934
No. Just gonna take away
lover-boy's meal ticket.

1611
01:52:18,099 --> 01:52:19,851
Put him down there.

1612
01:52:30,939 --> 01:52:32,816
Chance?

1613
01:52:35,419 --> 01:52:37,216
Chance.

1614
01:52:47,779 --> 01:52:49,929
Bring him over here.

1615
01:52:55,419 --> 01:52:57,535
Look at yourself.

1616
01:53:01,699 --> 01:53:04,293
No woman will ever again
pay to love that.

1617
01:53:24,739 --> 01:53:27,207
- Chance?
- Go in the house.

1618
01:53:27,379 --> 01:53:29,609
Hello? Yes, ma'am, just a moment.

1619
01:53:29,779 --> 01:53:31,531
Pa, phone. Governor calling.

1620
01:53:35,899 --> 01:53:39,289
- Chance?
- Hello, governor. How's the family?

1621
01:53:39,459 --> 01:53:42,576
- Fine, fine.
- Night, Aunt Nonnie.

1622
01:53:45,939 --> 01:53:50,615
Oh, baby, what did we do to you?

1623
01:53:58,179 --> 01:54:00,249
Don't cry.

1624
01:54:01,459 --> 01:54:05,771
Don't cry, baby. Is all right.
Is all right.

1625
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:10,410
What you heard was lies. Just lies.
The press will be here in a moment.

1626
01:54:10,579 --> 01:54:14,811
I want you here with me
to answer questions.

1627
01:54:16,539 --> 01:54:19,656
He sure busted up that dream of mine.

1628
01:54:26,899 --> 01:54:31,051
We're leaving.
We're leaving here right now.

1629
01:54:31,499 --> 01:54:34,252
My daughter will be here
to answer any and all questions.

1630
01:54:34,419 --> 01:54:36,137
Heavenly! Get in the house!

1631
01:54:36,299 --> 01:54:37,448
Go.

1632
01:54:38,179 --> 01:54:42,252
Papa, I'm never coming
into that house again.

1633
01:54:42,419 --> 01:54:44,091
Wait. Hold it, governor.

1634
01:54:44,259 --> 01:54:46,568
I'll call you back.

1635
01:54:46,739 --> 01:54:48,616
Come back here!

1636
01:54:48,779 --> 01:54:50,417
Come back!

1637
01:54:52,659 --> 01:54:56,857
- Nonnie, she can't leave here. Not now.
- Why?

1638
01:54:57,019 --> 01:55:03,094
- Me. What about me?
- You? You can go straight to hell.
