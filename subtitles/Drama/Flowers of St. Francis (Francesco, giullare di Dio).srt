6
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,440
2009's best drama - Boys Before Flowers.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,060
Boys Before Flowers' history, coming soon!

8
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,000
22th October 2008.
Boys Before Flowers, the first acting practice.

9
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,160
Goo JoonPyo's character was not made quickly.

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:54,030
He practiced hard to fit his character.

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,070
They practiced to change into their characters.

12
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,530
The first Boys Before Flowers shooting.

13
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,500
The shooting went through with great anticipation.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:13,490
The first shooting in Macao.

15
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,600
The episode was shot in Macao for romantic parts.

16
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,480
Boys Before Flowers episodes were finally ready.

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,820
It was a thrilling first episode.

18
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,570
14.3% of the T.V viewers watched the first episode.

19
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,760
Boys Before Flowers began to gain popularity.

20
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,860
A parody even started.

21
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:47,450
People constantly greet each other on the set.

22
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,660
Also, big and small accidents happened.

23
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,320
During the shootings, it became dangerous sometimes.

24
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:04,700
Following accidents on set, main characters got into car accidents.

25
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:10,190
The actress playing Geum JanDi, Goo HaeSun, got into a car accident.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,030
Inside this hospital is Goo HaeSun.

27
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,700
I just finished shooting an episode with her, before the accident.

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,650
I found out from my manager.

29
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,880
Which brings me here.

30
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:41,630
With worry, the F4 members entered the hospital.

31
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:52,680
Because of the shock of her accident, Goo HaeSun needed peace.

32
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,170
It's like as soon as I got over my car accident, she got into one.

33
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:10,990
I got pretty upset when I heard the news.

34
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,670
Her leg and her face were hurt in the accident.

35
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:20,030
I wish HaeSun will think of her health and rest.

36
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,890
I hope she only thinks about her health.

37
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:31,570
She should feel better and then start shooting episodes again.

38
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:37,400
I hope all the viewers understand that.

39
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,930
Please be patient until she recovers. Thank you for your consideration.

40
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,810
The popular drama Boys Before Flowers.

41
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:49,310
We will anticipate good news.

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,350
I know you have been anticipating new episodes.

43
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,030
I'm sorry, but there has, as you have just seen, been bad news.

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:04,100
Shooting of the drama has been delayed.

45
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,820
Instead, we have made a new special for this drama.

46
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,870
We'll show you behind the scenes moments of everyones'  favorite, F4.

47
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:25,460
We hope you anticipate this new show.

48
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,770
Tomorrow, episode 17 will air.
Please be patient for her to recover. Please just wait today.

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,170
Give a round of applause for the F4 members!

50
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:51,120
The schedule is pretty tight now, isn't it?

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,880
Yes, when I'm not busy, the most I can sleep is about 2 or 3 hours.

52
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,330
When you sleep a lot, it's only 2-3 hours?!

53
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:09,430
What happens when you can't sleep?
urm, well, I'll shoot all night, and get maybe 1-2 hours.

54
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,910
You must've been very tired. How about you Kim Bum?

55
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:20,000
No, I'm fine.

56
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,050
How about you, HyunJoong?  Your face has become very slender.

57
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,320
Yes, as I shoot more episodes, somehow I lost more body weight.

58
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,980
It becomes a diet, so I guess there are some good points!

59
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:34,860
Yes, it's pretty okay overall.

60
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:40,970
All staff members have been losing about 5-6kg while shooting.

61
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:47,830
Jun nee, you're okay too, right?

62
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:55,580
He's so good looking, I can't talk to him right!

63
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,100
It's not easy to talk to them when they're right in front of me!

64
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:04,100
I thought, "well, they can't be that good looking", but when I actually met them

65
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:12,830
How could they bring all the pretty boys together?
yes, so you can call me man4
Ah4, ah4!

66
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:19,520
There has been a lot of popularity for Boys Before Flowers. Do you notice?

67
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,900
JoonPyo, how do you take this in?

68
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,640
Well, I didn't really realize the popularity for the first or second episodes.  It wasn't until the third and fourth episode I started to see.

69
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,860
It was then when I saw how popular it really is.

70
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,090
So I think I really understood it then.

71
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,070
A little while ago, we went down to film (on location).  Around 2-3 thousand fans had gathered at the set during the shooting.

72
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:54,010
SInce it wasn't the last scene, I had to shoot another one that was supposed to finish at 11 pm.

73
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:59,300
We had to wait until about five a.m. .

74
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:02,680
So you had to wait until it got quiet, oohh.
Yeah, that's right.

75
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,520
Even fans get tired at around 5!

76
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:12,190
So the entire staff pretended to leave,

77
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:19,300
and they returned.
Wow!
But things like that might be the reason for later filming.

78
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,000
Now that I think of it, all of you have actually been in an accident, right?

79
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,770
Yes, my toes were hurt so I had surgery but now they're okay.

80
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,680
You visited GooHyeSeun too, how was she?

81
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:40,420
Well, when I saw her, her face had relaxed a lot.  Still, there

82
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:43,370
And she had surgery on her face, so the strings were

83
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,360
on the side of her lips?
Yes.

84
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,060
So until that gets better, she should probably rest.

85
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,940
There MAY be some people that do not know of the BBF story.

86
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,840
because due to its popularity rising, people may have just started watching.

87
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,380
For those viewers, I have prepared a summary of episodes 1-16 so far.

88
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:15,790
Let's watch!

89
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:21,890
The new transfer student to the luxury high school, ShinHwa, Geum JanDi.

90
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:30,600
Geum JanDi, fighting!

91
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,650
School life wasn't exactly comfortable for her.

92
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:54,590
Lick it.

93
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:57,460
Can't you stop?

94
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:00,370
Who is she?

95
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,540
What?
Then you lick it instead of her.

96
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,900
If you lick it, I'll let it go.

97
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:14,710
What's wrong with you?!

98
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:21,400
It's up, it's up!  The sophomore in class B, Geum JanDi, got the red card!

99
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,990
Hey, you keep chuckling to yourself, what's wrong with you?

100
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:32,160
Around this time, her lids probably popped.

101
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:48,180
Goo JoonPyo gradually began to fall for Geum JanDi.

102
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:51,620
What?

103
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,560
Stop . . .  stop now . . . help me.

104
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:20,410
You still don't believe me.

105
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,170
I believe..i believe in you.

106
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:42,820
In the name of ShinHwa F4, I have an announcement to make.

107
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:52,150
From this day forward, second year Geum JanDi will officially be the girlfriend of F4's Goo JoonPyo.

108
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,330
Where are we going?

109
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,500
I have something to show you..

110
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,080
Alright, look outside.

111
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,090
Wow, it's a heart! It's really in the shape of a heart!

112
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,600
If I found a girl I liked, I promised myself that I would bring her here.

113
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,030
Do you see it? My heart.

114
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:03,990
It's wrong, right?  It's all wrong, isn't it?

115
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:08,720
I guess that you know her better than me.

116
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,920
Sunbae.

117
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:26,610
Please, be happy.

118
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:30,020
Tell me you will be.

119
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,660
If sunbae's sad, I'm sad too.

120
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,490
They felt each other's pain in love.

121
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:10,300
So, it was like this?

122
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,360
Goo JoonPyo!   Stop, don't do this, this is . . .
This is what?  Is this something you don't know about either?

123
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:30,030
I'm sorry.
Geum JanDi, don't ever act like you know me from now on.

124
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:35,150
Due to JiHoo, JanDi and JoonPyo's love was over.

125
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,450
Yoon JiHoo is no longer a member of F4.

126
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,170
What?
JunPyo . . .

127
00:13:51,170 --> 00:14:00,440
Also, in a week from now, Yoon JiHoo and Geum JanDi will be expelled from this school.

128
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:05,480
But, then his heart couldn't easily forget Geum JanDi.

129
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:13,030
Why did it have to be JiHoo out of all people.
If only it wasn't JiHoo . . .

130
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,430
Goo JoonPyo . . .

131
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,440
Say that you like me once.

132
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:33,400
However, their thoughts were messed up about each other.

133
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:39,910
Yes?  What did you say?

134
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,400
JoonPyo.  Goo JoonPyo . . .

135
00:14:55,400 --> 00:15:00,370
Get up!  Geum JanDi's here!

136
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,610
Get up man!

137
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,800
Goo JoonPyo.
Please wake up.  Why are you doing this?

138
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:21,160
The words you wanted me to say, I think I can say them now.
But if you're like this, what am I supposed to do?

139
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,880
Wake up!

140
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,130
Are you telling the truth?

141
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:48,770
With F4's help, they confirmed the love between Geum JanDi and Goo JoonPyo.

142
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:52,140
Ya, Geum JanDi must have been really shocked. Look at her shoes, shoes!

143
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,350
JoonPyo, lucky you!

144
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:02,140
If it were me, I could die happy right now!
Sunbae!
Sorry.
We had to do something about it because both of you are so stubborn.

145
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,360
Meanwhile, Kang Hye Jang (JoonPyo's mom) finds out that they're dating.

146
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,610
Her dad's a dry cleaner,  her mom works at a bath house.

147
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,480
Yes, that's right.

148
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,190
Stop the car.
We don't need to stop the car.
Don't you hear me?!  STOP THE CAR!

149
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:32,200
Goo JunPyo.
/br Geum JanDi. Stand still,

150
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,670
please stand still.

151
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,840
But Goo JoonPyo shows his love in front of Kang Hye Jang.

152
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:58,100
Find JoonPyo right now.  He needs to go somewhere with me.

153
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Okay.

154
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,370
I didn't get to thank him.

155
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:12,810
I couldn't even tell him I like him.

156
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:18,980
And thus a long time of separation comes between the two.

157
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:25,190
I'll be back soon. Don't go anywhere, just wait . . .

158
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:28,960
I love you, Geum JanDi.

159
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,100
In this section, or entirely?

160
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:02,320
Uhm, entirely I'd have to say the first kiss with JanDi was most tender . . .

161
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,740
on the swings in the playground.

162
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,190
I'm good looking, I'm tall,  I have a lot of money.

163
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:45,130
NG..  (laugh).

164
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:49,770
Again!

165
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:58,990
I'm good looking.
I'm smart, I'm rich. How could you hate me?

166
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:03,980
Wow!  It's really good!  How could you hate him?

167
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,790
Please say that to . . .

168
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,390
Which one?
"Geum JanDi, 2year (of high school) Class B, is my girlfriend."?

169
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:19,740
No, not that.
Ahh, "kkuhjuh" (meaning go away).

170
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:25,610
Oh, I don't think I can do it.
Then please look at me and do it.

171
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:32,310
If I look at him, I can't do it even more!
Then please look at the middle and do it.

172
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:39,150
Kkuhjuh.
That "kkuhjuh" is cool.

173
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:47,060
I didn't need that many lines.

174
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:52,630
It was mostly, "Yo!  What's up?".

175
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:57,770
Then please show us the real way to say it.

176
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,640
It's not very friendly.

177
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,500
When I met my friends, I would say, "Yo!  What's up?"

178
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:13,700
It's awkward, right?

179
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,620
Get lost!

180
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,860
What about "kkujuh"?

181
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,530
"Hurry up and get lost", sorry.

182
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,370
The conversation between Goo JoonPyo and his older sister,

183
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:33,740
You remember, right?
You, know, "What kind of guys I hate the most?".
Here's his sister.

184
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:43,480
What kind of guys do I hate the most?

185
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,550
The guy who is lying.

186
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,410
the guy which i don't like most?

187
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:52,460
Wait, no, I'm sorry, I didn't catch the feeling in time.

188
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,780
Sorry, please thing that your sister got really sick

189
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:59,510
So now her nose is stuffy and her voice sounds different

190
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,300
A.. a unfair man.

191
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,430
A person who keeps a grudge?

192
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:20,540
Oh, what kind of man was that again?

193
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,600
And Goo JunPyo is what kind of man? Your older sister's favorite man!

194
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,400
The second section of the summary, let's watch together!

195
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:53,920
Yoon JiHoo had JanDi's back during hard times.

196
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,070
You're gonna catch a cold.

197
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm okay though.

198
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,180
Thank you.

199
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,640
It's really warm!

200
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,790
I hoped you wouldn't need it, but oh, well.

201
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:30,020
See?
Sunbae.

202
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:37,910
Whenever my heart rings the emergency bell, you appear.

203
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:40,800
Fine, command me.

204
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,050
What?

205
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:44,440
To be Geum JanDi's emergency car.

206
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:57,400
Hmm, it's my first time riding one of these.

207
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,840
In the end, JanDi goes to find JoonPyo in Macau.

208
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,950
H-hi.  I came.

209
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:23,340
Yeah, so what brings you here?

210
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:33,530
Just so you know, I'm doing fine.  And as you can see, I'm busy.

211
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:40,940
You can go now. You don't need to worry about me.

212
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,340
So to you, I'm like . . .
A stain I would like to erase./br

213
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,000
This is so cruel, Goo JoonPyo.

214
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,400
I was always like this.

215
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:03,860
Once again, JiHoo helps JanDi's broken heart.

216
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,880
It's the first time in my life, earning money with my own hands.

217
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,120
When I'm with you, there's a lot of new things I do.

218
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,620
So because of that, thanks.

219
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,790
Young master, should we go now?

220
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,830
Wait just a little bit.

221
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,850
Why did you come?

222
00:24:50,850 --> 00:24:52,310
I don't have anything to say to you.

223
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:56,620
Speaking of which, what are you doing ?

224
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,490
You think you have the right to ask that kind of question?

225
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,920
Yoon JiHoo!

226
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,590
I forgave you because you were my friend, and I tried to stay away from her because she was my friend's girl.

227
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:11,720
I held myself, and gave you a chance for you to be with her.

228
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,630
I'm not holding back any more.

229
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,600
Enough!

230
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,670
Why did you come?

231
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,380
Do you have something to say?

232
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:35,690
Fine. I get it.

233
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,120
I'm leaving.

234
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,460
A new girl appears in JunPyo's life.

235
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,590
Oh, I found him!

236
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:24,810
What do you mean, "What?"?  You're engaged to me!

237
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,940
Hey,  ugh.  Aren't you gonna let GO of me?

238
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:35,700
Listen carefully, I'm only saying this once. My name's Ha JaeKyung.   Starting today, I'm engaged to you.

239
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,790
You got it ?

240
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:44,890
From now on, I'm gonna tame you.

241
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:53,800
How is this love mess going to untangle itself?

242
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:08,150
Oh that's right! Lee Minho was chosen out of 200 people for his hairstyle?

243
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:16,670
When I went to the second tryouts, I went with my hair curled.

244
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:20,700
It's like the hair in comic books.

245
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:26,030
Yes, I made it similar to that and went.

246
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:32,840
The staff members said it suited me.

247
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,910
They said that, and I think they liked it.

248
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:39,600
That hairstyle is the same hairstyle for Goo JoonPyo right?

249
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,710
No, it wasn't.

250
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:46,750
That was the second time I curled it,

251
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,890
And the sixth time was when my hair turned perfectly into JoonPyo's hair.

252
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,030
Wow, you must've put a lot of effort into that!  But now it's a trend.

253
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:04,300
That's right, every guy has the same hairstyle either as Goo JoonPyo or HyunJoong.

254
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:10,170
Yeah. Everywhere you walk, everyone has Goo Joonpyo's  or Hyunjoong's hair style

255
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:16,000
Even this announcer next to me tried to copy HyunJoong's hairstyle!

256
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,050
Yeah, I was going to do your hair style, but I undid it.
How did everyone else get their role?

257
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:28,320
I'm still preparing concert in JP...

258
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:48,750
You asked them what you would be doing and how did they reply?

259
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:53,480
For now, just do what you're doing.

260
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:57,860
And I asked them what they were doing without me knowing.

261
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:03,640
At that time, BBF was a hit in Japan.

262
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,000
So at first, I thought they were kidding.

263
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,870
So they told me we'd talk back in Korea, so after the concert,

264
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:15,870
when I got there, they wanted to have a meeting.

265
00:29:15,870 --> 00:29:27,100
So at the meeting, they told me there was a drama casting, and they asked me what I thought of it.

266
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,890
But I told them I had to quickly release an album in Japan!  But my manager said

267
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:38,360
to do it because it was a good opportunity, so I did.

268
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:43,430
So there was a story behind this!
And apparently your manager is very scary!

269
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:48,600
My manager is a very nice person.

270
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,340
In my position, my character was cast very late.

271
00:29:53,340 --> 00:30:01,000
But I think that there was no way around it, 'cause they were casting East of Eden at that time.

272
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,110
I think because I met the right opportunities, I'm living happily  and having fun.

273
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,080
Kim Jun, how was your casting as WooBin?

274
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,180
It's my first time in a drama, so I watched the auditions.

275
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,400
Yes, yes.  Auditions aren't something that you look at and memorize,

276
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,790
it's something you continuously have to look over.

277
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:58,900
Before that, we had no idea who was cast,

278
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:05,950
Lee MinHo and I met at auditions, but I didn't know his role or anything.

279
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:09,090
So I wondered, why is his hair so curled?

280
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I saw him during the audition, so . . .

281
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:23,510
He's tall. On top of that, he was walking around with glaring eyes.

282
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:32,050
He looked cool, and I later found out that we were cast together.

283
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:42,340
I had recently seen the movie "Public Enemy Returns."

284
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:49,580
So when I saw him, I thought, "Oh, the guy who got stabbed with a knife!"

285
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:57,470
I kept remembering that part in the movie!

286
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,190
The dead guy shouldn't be here.

287
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:04,500
So I felt a little weird when I first saw him.

288
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,600
I remember Kim Bum in a drama, where he was really good at crying scenes.

289
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:18,600
So for those reasons, I found it really interesting.

290
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:26,910
So the person who dies, the person who cries, Kim Joon...

291
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:30,410
Wasn't that a first impression?

292
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:38,350
At first, I saw GaEul in a movie

293
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:44,160
"The Show Must Go on." She came out as a bad girl.

294
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:52,330
She was in that movie?
Yes, as the bad daughter.

295
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:56,200
My wife is in that too.
Right. That's right.

296
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,770
Oh yes, my wife appears in that same movie in the middle somewhere.

297
00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:01,180
Why did I mention this?

298
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,610
So Kim Joon, aren't you the oldest in this group? How is it after being friendly with the other three of the F4?

299
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:16,800
There are some similar parts and different parts. Like MinHo, he looks very tall and sophisticated.

300
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:26,180
But when you get familiar with him, he has this cute behavior.

301
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,160
He's really kind and sweet unlike the character he plays.

302
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:44,450
WIth HyunJoong, it's pretty much the same. He's funny.

303
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:50,630
HyunJoong is basically your atmosphere maker.

304
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:55,100
Yes, that seems right.

305
00:33:55,100 --> 00:34:01,430
He has this unexpected personality to him.

306
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:07,340
When I first saw KimBum, he looked young.

307
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:12,420
But actually, he's very experienced and I ask for help from him sometimes.

308
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:18,790
What is Kim Joon like?
He's the problem solver of the group.

309
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:26,130
When we're hanging out, he handles situations like this...

310
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:31,800
He takes control of situations. He says he's not good at something and shows slight potential for scamming.

311
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:41,740
He's almost like a con artist.
He says he can't do something, but he really can, and wins.

312
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:44,610
He must be really competitive.
He must have really held that against me. He mentioned it before, too.

313
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:50,820
But, he really has a good heart. Really.

314
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,590
But, he's really modest to the extreme.

315
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,960
He can do everything.
He says he can't, but there is nothing he can't do.

316
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,460
Everyone must have lost a bet to him once.

317
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:09,810
It's not as popular as the national drama "Boys over Flowers," but you must know the national pop song right?

318
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:14,720
I guess you don't know "Noona's Dream."
[Hyung Young's Song "Noona's Dream"]

319
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,740
It's really not the national pop song, is it?

320
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:26,190
Noona's fantasies. I asked the ladies around me who are 30 and over this question.

321
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:29,640
"What present do you wish to receive from F4?"

322
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,950
Let's see what girls want as a present from the F4!

323
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,000
The first present they want to receive is . . .

324
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,670
To have a scarf tied by So YiJung.

325
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,940
That scene outside the club . . .

326
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:56,490
Although it was just an act, it was the first scene where feelings are shown for GaEul.

327
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,900
Well, we must see this since there are possibly some people who don't know what we're talking about.

328
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:26,190
Must be nice....and here, let me pull out your hair

329
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:35,390
Oh, and this side, too.
So that was the first one.

330
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:39,800
And so what was the second one?

331
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,310
Here's the second one.

332
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,500
And the second one is...

333
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:49,570
To have shoes put on by Yoon JiHoo.

334
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,510
You did wash your feet this morning, right?
Oh, of course...I went to the bathhouse.

335
00:36:54,510 --> 00:37:04,070
Oh, these are those expensive shoes in Macau

336
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:10,600
Is this the right size for you?
You must be lucky!

337
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:23,010
Oh my, what to do?

338
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,850
I wanted to buy you something with the first money I ever earned.

339
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:32,990
Thank you, JiHoo.  I'll wear it well.

340
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:46,410
Oh, this is so awesome.

341
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:51,300
It's alright, right, Jihoo?
Yes, I think it's fine.

342
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,550
We have one more left, to receive a back hug from Goo JoonPyo.

343
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:06,630
Everyone, please don't hate Hyun-young.

344
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:12,590
I happen to be the only woman here, so . . .

345
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:17,840
We got it all ready.
Oh, shall we do the necklace?  You pick one out of the two.

346
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,470
Actually, when the necklace is given, it's given in the state of the back hug.

347
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:25,020
So you must do both.
Ladies, use your imagination and put your face in this picture right now.

348
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:30,610
I'm substituting for everyone.

349
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:43,440
I won't be placing the necklace around your neck.

350
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,400
What should I do?
Stay still!
[I am so happy!]

351
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:59,010
Please give a round of applause.
are you trembling from him just touching you?

352
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:02,720
Oh, I can have it?

353
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,600
Yes, please have it.
Oh thank you

354
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,830
Isn't there only one of this kind in the world?
No, there's a lot.

355
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:20,320
But the only two people who received this necklace from the F4 ar Geum JanDi and me.

356
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:29,860
If I could come back in another life, I would want to be in F4.
Since all I've done is receive, I prepared something for you, too.

357
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:39,860
Do-shi-rak (lunch box).

358
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:49,370
The eye is like a monster.
I actually like eyes are closer together.

359
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:55,330
The nose is in the middle of the face

360
00:39:55,330 --> 00:40:00,580
I think it got carsick - Im sorry

361
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:09,000
Please take the lunch box

362
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,140
The carsick lunch box.

363
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:18,410
Because of this, girls were going crazy trying to bake cookies

364
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:25,450
I've made them too, Goo JoonPyo cookies!

365
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:35,000
Yoon JiHoo eats one, too.

366
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:58,650
Charismatic JoonPyo, smooth JiHoo,

367
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:05,020
Casanova YiJung, and tough WooBin

368
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,730
It is hard, so we have something prepared for you all: King before Flowers.

369
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:11,500
Out of these four gentlemen, who is the king?

370
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,470
You have a rose in your hand right?

371
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:26,480
We will see at the end who has the most flowers

372
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,680
Let's see who gets the most roses.

373
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:33,400
Let's start asking the questions now.

374
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,620
First question.  Of the members, who is the best looking?

375
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,320
Please start thinking now

376
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:53,100
This is hard right? When i look at it its a hard decision too.
Hmmm, maybe each thinks he is the best-looking...

377
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,720
In that case, you can keep the flower yourself.
Oh yeah?

378
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:01,380
If you think it's yourself, you don't need to give it to anyone.
Oh, it looks like Kim Bum has something planned...

379
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,440
1, 2, 3 . . .
Oh, this is weird.  Thank you.

380
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:20,350
Of the members, who has the most individual roles?

381
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:38,400
Kim Joon has 2
Be sure to accept the flower that's coming to you...

382
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:45,820
You can't leave that out

383
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:52,450
In the drama it's very embarrassing to dance though

384
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:12,440
1, 2, dan dan [dance steps], 1 , 2 dan dan.
Go backwards then forwards.

385
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:22,520
Yes, these are the dance steps. Ready, start.
Just do that and that's the dance, right?
Let's match it to the music.

386
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,140
Oh wait, this isn't quite right.

387
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,700
I heard that you're really good at guitar as well

388
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:02,500
I think in episode 17 or 18, I play the guitar for JanDi.

389
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,500
Which is why we've prepared a guitar for you!

390
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:37,020
Oh this is a bit...
What about that piece you played...

391
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,890
Remember when you took the apple away?
Was there guitar playing in the apple scene?
Oh, what was that?

392
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:04,090
it's because my fingers are cold.

393
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:09,020
I can't play the guitar.
I don't really have any musical talent.

394
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:14,350
Oh, it's totally fine.
I can play the piano.

395
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:18,140
Oh, piano?
This house doesn't seem to have a piano.
Oh, then later, in the other room, we can use the piano.

396
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:23,470
We'll play it in the next room.
Do you, by chance, know how to play the guitar as well?

397
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:31,070
I also play piano...
Oh so you all play piano. We'll hear your piano playing in the next room, then.

398
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:37,990
Better than the drama, the NG's!

399
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:40,680
NG before flowers!

400
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:51,420
How should I do so?
Sunbae, snap out if it, please!
And if I can't... oops! sorry

401
00:45:54,950 --> 00:46:01,530
Sunbae, snap out of it, please!
the one who isn't snapping out of is... Aiyah! I'm going crazy. Sorry

402
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,470
It's a good morning.

403
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,600
In the name of F4, I have an announcement to make..
Laughing...
What's wrong with  you?
I'm sorry.

404
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:45,570
Go now.

405
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:50,800
I'm sorry
Where's the headrest?

406
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:27,760
Do you want to die?

407
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:22,640
Before it cools, you have to eat it when it's still warm.

408
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,690
Oh this is so well-cooked...
Honey, what about the braised fish?

409
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:32,360
CAPTION:  Do I really have to eat this?
This has been cooking since the crack of dawn...

410
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:45,390
Noona!

411
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,810
Is this funny?

412
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:55,770
Butler Lee, ttak ok ok gah.... (Trying to say ttak kuh, meaning clean it up.)

413
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:14,360
Ah, the night air feels nice.  Hey, do you remember?

414
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,100
The thing we did when we were young

415
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:56,630
Move; let me do it.

416
00:49:56,630 --> 00:50:03,610
Call JoonPyo.  JanDi's in danger.

417
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:49,660
Sorry, man, I'm really sorry.

418
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:03,020
Glad to meet you (She's Chinese)
- Oh, Glad to meet you. You can speak korean!

419
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,600
I love you.
I love you? By whom were you taught?

420
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:20,810
[They're still acting]
(She's speaking in Chinese)

421
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:26,870
What did you just say?

422
00:52:26,870 --> 00:52:33,980
Huh?
I have nothing to talk about, anymore.

423
00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,860
I really have nothing more to say.

424
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:43,540
Mini series "Boys over Flowers..."

425
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:49,650
Flower boys' NG will be continued till the end of the drama, with you viewers.

426
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,840
After watched it, you guys said no, but in my opinion,

427
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,900
The NG King is already picked.

428
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:08,820
The NG(mistakes during shooting) King - Lee MinHo.

429
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:15,000
You admit your mistakes quickly, though, don't you?
Yes, I should admit them quickly.

430
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,570
You have reactions each, after you make NG, don't you?

431
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:26,530
I think MinHo says he's sorry asap, if he makes one.
Right, I admit my mistakes early.

432
00:53:26,530 --> 00:53:31,800
Since we are visiting the house, shall we begin our tour now?
Yes, we should take a look around.

433
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:35,910
Many women must be waiting for this moment.

434
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,620
We're now moving.

435
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:44,430
Can you lead us?
- Where would you like to go first?
Let's go to your room

436
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:55,690
We're here in JunPyo's room.
- Right, I'm in JUNPYO's room.

437
00:53:55,690 --> 00:54:01,770
Everyone has much anticipated this... Junpyo would you tell us more about the room?

438
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:09,850
Everything has been prepared in advance.
The closet is actually elsewhere, but you can see the clothes that are used during filming.

439
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:18,100
This fur is Goo Joonpyo's trademark

440
00:54:18,100 --> 00:54:28,840
Did you see "Gag Concert (a Korean show)" when they wore this?

441
00:54:28,840 --> 00:54:32,470
Yes, I saw it.
- About hat Goo JunPyo, how did you feel?

442
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:35,730
His fur didn't look that expensive.

443
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,660
His furs were just hairs.

444
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,450
So this is the bed, eh?

445
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:46,990
This bed is where JanDi laid, when she got hurt, isn't it?

446
00:54:46,990 --> 00:54:55,590
No it's not.
- Huh?
This house has many beds.
That's in a different room.

447
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:59,660
So this is just Goo Joonpyo's room

448
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:05,700
Oh, the guest room?
Uh... not the guest ro-- Er, yeah. The guest room..Correct.

449
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:12,430
Then, shall we go to that room?
This window, this is the window that you sneaked out of to save Jandi?

450
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,900
Oh, but you can't open it.
- Oh, I can't open it.

451
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,370
Outside is just a set.

452
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:26,960
ohhh, it does open.

453
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:32,630
Why don't you try going outside?

454
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:39,370
Let's go with F4 and HyunYoung.

455
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:46,710
ohh this is yoon ji hoo's housee.      -yeahh this is yoon ji hoo's/ my house.

456
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:55,380
Goo Joonpyo's house is kind of luxurious and has an antique feel to it, but Yoon Jihoo's house seems more modern.

457
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:02,690
Because it's the house of the former president's grandson, it has a more "Hano" feel to it.

458
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,690
The design is very modern

459
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:10,740
Just a short while ago, we find out about your grandfather, right?

460
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:14,030
Isn't it a bit too big for you to live in by yourself?  Why don't you live together?

461
00:56:14,030 --> 00:56:21,690
My grandfather hasn't been back in 15 years. BR Ah, it's been 15 years since he left this house...

462
00:56:21,690 --> 00:56:27,410
Soon, depending on what the screenwriter decides...

463
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:33,180
We'll find out whether he will come back, or if he will forever stay away.

464
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,940
So it depends on the writer...
Also, my house...

465
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:42,320
has a very special "tahb" (tower) in the back.

466
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:48,410
You can't see it from here, but...

467
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,820
Oh, there really is a tower back here.  What is the name of the tower?

468
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:58,200
It's called "Dabo Tahb"
Ah... "Dabo Tahb"?

469
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:03,900
Didn't this belong in Kyongju? You brought it over here?
Yes, because I'm the former president's grandson, everything is permissable

470
00:57:03,900 --> 00:57:09,180
Is "Dabo Tahb" the only tower name that you know, HyunJoon?

471
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:14,320
No, no..
Then what other tower's do you know of?
Well there's the "Big Bang Tahb..."

472
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:26,020
Joon and Bum, what do you find the most appealing about this house?

473
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:30,180
Something that you feel is really your style?
I like the "hano" feel of the ceilings.

474
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:37,830
But, Joon and Bum, have you even had the chance to come to this set?

475
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:44,890
Bum:  I've been here before but, Joon hasn't.
Joon:  Yeah, this is my first time looking around.

476
00:57:44,890 --> 00:57:48,390
Take a look around.  Is there anything that you like?

477
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:52,570
The interior is really nice, but what really caught my attention from when we first came in is this elephant.

478
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:58,760
Oh the elephant?
Yes, is this something that i can ride?
If you don't ride it properly, it could break.

479
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,950
In Joonpyo's room there was a horse, and here, there's an elephant.  When they were young...

480
00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,320
they got to ride these.
Lucky little kids.

481
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:13,960
Shall we go over this way now?

482
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:20,120
Back over here is a piano.  Just a while ago, we talked about playing.

483
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:25,700
All of you play piano well, right?
We need to hear you.

484
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:29,160
Not "play well," just "play"

485
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:31,910
First, let's start with Kim Bum

486
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:35,460
Wow... then Joon...

487
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:41,770
the instruments... oh, let me move over to that side. No no, stay there.

488
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:49,540
What piece will you play for us?

489
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,900
I'll play something that you've probably heard, it's called "Romance"

490
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:59,750
We know the lyrics to that...BR Kim Joon appears to be an extremely well-versed pianist.

491
00:58:59,750 --> 00:59:06,310
Then, since Kim Joon and I are singers, we'll hum.

492
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:10,560
Okay, but your voice is too high.

493
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:46,200
Wow, but apart from this do you know anything more modern?

494
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:53,540
Uh...
Do you know ??? (some Korean pop song)by any chance?

495
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:59,890
I don't have any experience playing those kind of songs.
Oh, I can't play very well.

496
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,840
The thing with these guys is they all say that can't play well but then...
No, I really can't play well.

497
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:11,930
I'll play Moon River.

498
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:54,330
Come on, Joon, sing.
Wait, that isn't right.
No, it sounds right.

499
01:00:54,330 --> 01:01:01,140
I'll stop here...it's been so long since I've played.
Wow, all of your are so talented with instruments.

500
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:06,660
HyunJoon, you can play too, right?
Well, I can play the pop tune, "Want to see you..."

501
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:14,070
"Want to see you?"  Oh!  In that case, since it's about time to sign off anyway,

502
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:17,890
We'll go ahead and say our farewells, then as a finale, HyunJoon can play "Want to see you" since we all want to see "Boys Over Flowers"

503
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:23,560
Thanks to your love and support, we've come to this point--Episode 16...

504
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:31,070
to 17 and 18, and about 8 more epidodes to go.

505
01:01:31,070 --> 01:01:35,340
We will do our best so that we can end well.
And we ask for you full support until the end.  Thank  you.

506
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:41,910
Because of some accidents, these car accidents...

507
01:01:41,910 --> 01:01:48,630
regretful though it may seem,
we really need to consider the actors' and actresses' heath first.

508
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:52,500
If you'll be patient just a bit more, then we'll present a great, upgraded...

509
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:59,900
final few epidsodes.  And keep Koo Hyesun in your thoughts...
and please continue to love "Boys over Flowers"

510
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:04,540
Tomorrow evening, episode 17 will air.  Please keep loving "Boys over Flowers."

511
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:10,640
I'm also eagerly looking forward to watching,
but I'll be patient until tomorrow.  Everyone, watch with us tomorrow night.
