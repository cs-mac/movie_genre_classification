1
00:01:06,999 --> 00:01:12,237
The working men of God's
Pocket are simple men.

2
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,938
They work.

3
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:15,540
They follow their teams.

4
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:20,710
They marry and have children
who rarely leave the Pocket.

5
00:01:22,648 --> 00:01:26,311
Everyone here has stolen
something from somebody else..

6
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,885
or when they were kids, they
set someone's house on fire..

7
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:36,630
or they ran away when they
should have stayed and fought.

8
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:43,972
They know who cheats at cards
and who slaps their kids around.

9
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:50,818
And no matter what anybody
does, they're still here.

10
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:55,238
And whatever they
are is what they are.

11
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:02,643
The only thing they can't forgive
is not being from God's Pocket.

12
00:02:16,268 --> 00:02:17,268
Say it.

13
00:02:17,269 --> 00:02:18,436
Say it.

14
00:02:18,437 --> 00:02:19,604
Oh, your balls.

15
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:21,172
Oh.. oh, my God.

16
00:02:21,173 --> 00:02:22,640
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

17
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:23,775
It's good, right?

18
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,276
Oh, it's so good.

19
00:02:25,277 --> 00:02:27,336
- Oh!
- Your cook's so good.

20
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:38,161
Mm.

21
00:02:44,363 --> 00:02:46,397
You okay?

22
00:02:46,398 --> 00:02:48,241
Great.

23
00:02:50,302 --> 00:02:51,536
Jeanie.

24
00:02:51,537 --> 00:02:53,838
Mickey, I know. You love me.

25
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:55,784
I do.

26
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,511
If Leon is going to work today,

27
00:03:00,512 --> 00:03:04,141
I got to be down at Bird's
by 8:00 if he wants a ride.

28
00:03:05,417 --> 00:03:07,783
Leon, honey, it's time for work.

29
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,323
All right.

30
00:03:12,324 --> 00:03:16,317
Mickey's got to be to Bird's
by 8:00 if you want a ride.

31
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,097
Honey?

32
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,770
I'm up!

33
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,545
"Everyone here has stolen
something from somebody else,"

34
00:03:34,546 --> 00:03:37,248
"or when they were kids, they
set someone's house on fire,"

35
00:03:37,249 --> 00:03:40,718
"or they ran away when they
should have stayed and fought."

36
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,488
That Richard Shellburn's
got it right.

37
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,990
I don't know why writing
down what everybody knows

38
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:48,767
is any better than knowing
it in the first place.

39
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:52,263
If you were from
here, you'd get it.

40
00:03:52,264 --> 00:03:54,755
That's what everyone tells me.

41
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:00,614
I don't know how you eat that
shit and still look so good.

42
00:04:02,107 --> 00:04:05,213
You get sugar diabetes, they're
gonna cut your feet off.

43
00:04:13,052 --> 00:04:15,259
Fuck you looking at?

44
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:28,172
Something to eat in the truck, hon.

45
00:04:41,613 --> 00:04:43,281
See, I told you it'd
take me no time at all.

46
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:45,341
You got me ten minutes
late already.

47
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:52,357
Fuckin'..fuck it.

48
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:54,125
You mind spotting me 20 bucks?

49
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:57,128
They start on one end, and
the air in Camden is so bad

50
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:59,530
and it takes so fucking long
to get to the other end

51
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:01,399
that by then, the
paint is all peeling,

52
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,935
and they got to go back
and start all over again.

53
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:09,574
Year after year, painting the same
fucking bridge over and over.

54
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:10,975
It's like a nightmare.

55
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,546
Ho!

56
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,480
- You're late.
- I know. I'm sorry.

57
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,257
Another five minutes, we was
gonna leave without you.

58
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:21,155
"We"?

59
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,295
This horse is a fantastic,
beautiful horse, talented horse.

60
00:05:31,296 --> 00:05:32,530
Hard for me to believe.

61
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,399
I seen it myself in Florida.

62
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,235
You're telling me there was something
wrong with the horse's pussy,

63
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,203
made her quit 300 yards
from the finish?

64
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:43,074
Turning Leaf, her name was, and she
hit the stretch and just quit.

65
00:05:43,075 --> 00:05:47,745
Turns out she sucked up
air, you know, vaginally.

66
00:05:47,746 --> 00:05:50,148
A couple gallons of air
get trapped up in there,

67
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:52,683
and she cramps up,
and she can't run..

68
00:05:52,684 --> 00:05:54,285
very uncommon.

69
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:56,988
It's like running while you're
trying to take a shit, huh?

70
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:59,257
It was the humidity.

71
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:02,493
Horse like that runs up
here, she'd take the field.

72
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,595
Let's go!

73
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:07,565
I want to know what a white
man's doing walking..

74
00:06:09,768 --> 00:06:12,498
while this nigger is
riding around all day.

75
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,020
Nothing personal, Lucy, huh?

76
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,816
So I grab that fucking
cat by the tail, right?

77
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:27,485
I hold him upside down,
and that little stewardess

78
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:30,488
is screaming for me
to leave him alone,

79
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:34,258
and I says, "I'll leave him
alone, all right," and..

80
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:35,426
and I take my knife..

81
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:37,895
Boy, you're about to figure
a way to wipe your ass

82
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,194
with that razor, ain't you?

83
00:06:47,606 --> 00:06:50,052
I ain't said a word all morning.

84
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,484
Which one is it?

85
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:00,852
It's a green truck.

86
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,788
I got a plate number
right over here.

87
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:05,223
All these trucks are green.

88
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,858
Yeah, but I got a
number right over here.

89
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,192
It's gonna take a fucking month

90
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,228
just to read the fucking
license plates on that one.

91
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:11,295
Well, that ain't it.

92
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:13,355
We're looking for a reefer.

93
00:07:14,666 --> 00:07:16,400
A refrigerated truck, you know,

94
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,737
so the meat don't cook
on its way to Vermont.

95
00:07:19,738 --> 00:07:20,805
Mm..hmm.

96
00:07:20,806 --> 00:07:22,106
It's running.

97
00:07:22,107 --> 00:07:23,708
They don't shut them off.

98
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,409
They're diesels.

99
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,981
Keep them running
for weeks at a time.

100
00:07:29,047 --> 00:07:30,481
That's very interesting..

101
00:07:30,482 --> 00:07:32,450
the history of the
trucking industry.

102
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:34,285
All right, stay here.
I'm gonna go take a piss.

103
00:07:34,286 --> 00:07:36,129
All right.

104
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:44,962
Oh.

105
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,265
What's Sal doing here?

106
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,333
Doesn't take three
people to steal a truck.

107
00:07:49,334 --> 00:07:51,569
I owe him a little money.

108
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,141
He just wants to make sure
everything goes down.

109
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,641
Look at him over here.

110
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,543
He's pissing on his shoes.

111
00:07:58,544 --> 00:07:59,577
Yeah.

112
00:07:59,578 --> 00:08:01,746
Why don't you tell him?

113
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:05,285
He'll shoot you just to show
you he knows what he's doing.

114
00:08:11,623 --> 00:08:13,591
That's it right there.

115
00:08:26,705 --> 00:08:27,738
Hey.

116
00:08:27,739 --> 00:08:30,107
Yeah?

117
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,885
Notice the whole world's got
a fucking attitude lately?

118
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,382
Listen, you go in there, and you have
a nice breakfast, pal, all right?

119
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,717
You take an hour. Understand?

120
00:08:39,718 --> 00:08:42,926
One hour before you come back
out here looking for your truck.

121
00:08:45,724 --> 00:08:47,783
Who's driving?

122
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:54,460
You all right, pal?

123
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:58,402
Look, you got your business.
We got ours.

124
00:08:58,403 --> 00:09:00,605
You take the money,
your business is over.

125
00:09:00,606 --> 00:09:02,306
Am I right or wrong?

126
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:03,407
Huh?

127
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:06,070
Okay, just take a
couple of deep breaths.

128
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,079
Here's your hat, all right?

129
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,113
Can you get up?

130
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:11,958
And gonna have a nice
breakfast, just like I said.

131
00:09:12,951 --> 00:09:14,852
Come on.

132
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:17,154
All of a sudden, the world
ain't got no attitude no more.

133
00:09:17,155 --> 00:09:19,032
What the fuck?

134
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,291
Don't do it.

135
00:10:07,072 --> 00:10:08,939
Shit.

136
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:12,205
Jesus Christ.

137
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:23,998
Motherfucker.

138
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:27,725
You shit yourself, Mickey?

139
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:28,859
- Oh, yeah.
- Huh?

140
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,294
Fuck you.

141
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,830
I almost cut her tits
off after I, uh,

142
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,433
took care of her fucking kid.

143
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:37,501
I seen that happen to a girl once.

144
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:38,703
Huh?

145
00:10:38,704 --> 00:10:40,338
Sliced and diced,
just right fuckin'..

146
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:42,034
Bullsh..shit.

147
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:47,678
What the fuck you say?

148
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,853
I heard you talking about me.

149
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:55,753
I don't give a shit personally,

150
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,089
but I don't like a nigger
talking about my business.

151
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:02,362
This old nigger's been talking
about me all morning.

152
00:11:03,595 --> 00:11:04,762
Whoa.

153
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,936
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

154
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:11,259
You hear me now, don't you, fuck?

155
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:18,111
I didn't mean to cut you, Lucy.

156
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:21,312
Somebody get Lucy
a Band-Aid. He's..

157
00:11:21,313 --> 00:11:23,759
He's got a cut.

158
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,646
I thought he was..

159
00:11:40,999 --> 00:11:43,100
I love this city..

160
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:45,936
not the sights, the city.

161
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:48,706
I love her last night, and
I loved her this morning,

162
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,841
before she brushes her teeth

163
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:54,141
or I know she snores.

164
00:11:56,448 --> 00:11:59,650
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

165
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:03,053
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

166
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,856
I've known her warmth
and her coolness.

167
00:12:05,857 --> 00:12:08,692
She's.. forgiven me.

168
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:10,594
I've forgiven her.

169
00:12:10,595 --> 00:12:11,996
I'm used..

170
00:12:11,997 --> 00:12:13,964
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

171
00:12:13,965 --> 00:12:16,445
I'm used to the feel
of her beside me.

172
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,136
You're right.

173
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:21,412
I think I fucked her
last night too.

174
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,241
I hope she don't have
no type of herpes.

175
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,608
I'm used to the feel
of her, you know?

176
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:35,784
I've been writing the story
of this city for 20 years.

177
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:57,241
What's up with the lights?

178
00:12:57,242 --> 00:12:59,076
Oh, talk to Arthur, Mick.

179
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:01,523
I keep telling him
he's got to relax.

180
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,581
- I'll do that.
- Do that.

181
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:06,750
All we can do is have faith
in the electric company.

182
00:13:06,751 --> 00:13:08,452
- Am I right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

183
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,921
Sophie says we ain't had
electric for two hours.

184
00:13:10,922 --> 00:13:12,456
It's out in the whole neighborhood.

185
00:13:12,457 --> 00:13:13,491
Yeah.

186
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,092
What are we gonna do with
the load I just brought in?

187
00:13:15,093 --> 00:13:17,428
What the fuck do you think we're
trying to figure out here, Mick?

188
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,830
It's gonna be back
right away. Just relax.

189
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:20,865
Yeah.

190
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:22,967
Listen, we got a little business
to talk about, all right?

191
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,458
Right.

192
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,640
I got a problem.

193
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:30,708
Let me guess.

194
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,710
You don't have my $700.

195
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,044
I'm into Sal for 20 large.

196
00:13:36,748 --> 00:13:38,115
Jesus Christ.

197
00:13:38,116 --> 00:13:39,683
I got so much shit going down,

198
00:13:39,684 --> 00:13:41,318
I don't even know where
it's coming from.

199
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,387
Forget it. I'm doing all right.

200
00:13:43,388 --> 00:13:45,289
When you get it,
you can give it to me.

201
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,323
All right?

202
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:48,269
Take some of the meat.

203
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:54,932
Nothing I can do with that.

204
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:56,967
It's not even cut.

205
00:13:56,968 --> 00:13:58,102
Fuck it.

206
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:02,130
Let's get this shit in your truck.

207
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,278
I can't use it like this.
There's nowhere to cut it up.

208
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,281
Look, we'll get the electric
back on, you come back tomorrow,

209
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,581
we'll get somebody to
cut it up for you.

210
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:18,789
- Here you go.
- I got it.

211
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,553
- You got it, Mick?
- All right.

212
00:14:21,693 --> 00:14:24,799
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

213
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,131
Fuck it all.

214
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,430
It all works out in the end.

215
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,019
All right, what happened here?

216
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,735
It was the lift.

217
00:15:07,939 --> 00:15:09,941
The shackle come loose.

218
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:13,243
Usually it's tied down
when we're not using it.

219
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:15,212
The..

220
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:18,482
chain swung out, and the shackle..

221
00:15:18,483 --> 00:15:20,384
hit the boy right in
the back of the head.

222
00:15:20,385 --> 00:15:22,586
That's what happened.

223
00:15:22,587 --> 00:15:24,355
I seen the whole thing.

224
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,415
Kid never knew what hit him.

225
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,560
Anyone else?

226
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,802
I seen it too.

227
00:15:33,264 --> 00:15:34,665
What was his job?

228
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:36,395
He was a day laborer.

229
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,005
That it?

230
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,338
That's what happened.

231
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,922
Jeanie?

232
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,552
Jeanie.

233
00:16:23,181 --> 00:16:25,786
Leon's dead.

234
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:41,398
Richard.

235
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,000
You feeling all right?

236
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:45,269
Yeah, I had the flu.

237
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,905
Didn't see your column
on page two yesterday.

238
00:16:47,906 --> 00:16:50,908
Opened the paper to see a
goddamn picture of some girl

239
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,174
that had her teeth wired
together to lose weight.

240
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,781
Readers count on you, Richard.

241
00:16:57,782 --> 00:17:00,451
Feeling much better today, okay.

242
00:17:00,452 --> 00:17:02,386
So I looked over the last year.

243
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:05,689
Did you know you missed 42
days, not counting vacations?

244
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:06,957
Really?

245
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,058
Mm..hmm.

246
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:11,328
And I got to thinking about it.

247
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:14,998
Maybe we ought to bring in
another columnist, you know,

248
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,800
someone to lighten the load.

249
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,102
Found one yet?

250
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,604
Thought I'd give you a
chance to think it over.

251
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:22,940
Whatever you want, Brookie.

252
00:17:22,941 --> 00:17:25,175
But of course, if it's
a drinking problem..

253
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:26,477
No.

254
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,346
'Cause we have sent people
up to Horizons to dry out.

255
00:17:29,347 --> 00:17:30,814
We could do it for you too.

256
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:32,015
No.

257
00:17:32,016 --> 00:17:34,507
It's a bug I caught.

258
00:17:37,822 --> 00:17:40,302
Here's my anniversary column.

259
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,091
Yeah.

260
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,391
You have to eat something.

261
00:18:14,392 --> 00:18:17,088
She probably already ate lunch.

262
00:18:17,695 --> 00:18:20,960
He was just a baby.

263
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:27,237
- Hello.
- Mick, it's Bird.

264
00:18:27,238 --> 00:18:29,139
Hi. You get your electricity back?

265
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,141
Yeah, it came on right
after you left.

266
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:32,976
This isn't a great time.

267
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:34,311
Why, what's the matter?

268
00:18:34,312 --> 00:18:36,146
We had an accident with Leon.

269
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:38,615
What, he got his dick caught
in somebody's cash register?

270
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,684
No, it's a real thing.
Something happened at work.

271
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,286
Some kind of accident. He's dead.

272
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:43,520
What?

273
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:44,755
What is it?

274
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:46,790
Well, they say
something fell on him.

275
00:18:46,791 --> 00:18:48,425
Fell on him? No shit.

276
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:49,726
Yeah.

277
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,828
Jesus.

278
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,696
I'm sorry to hear that.

279
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:53,730
Yeah.

280
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:55,365
Anyway, what I was calling about..

281
00:18:55,366 --> 00:18:58,468
I don't know if it's the appropriate
time, but it's that horse,

282
00:18:58,469 --> 00:19:00,204
the one you was talking
about, Turning Leaf?

283
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,907
She's running in a $15,000
claimer tomorrow at Keystone.

284
00:19:03,908 --> 00:19:06,009
I'm scaring up everything I can.

285
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,979
Figured you'd want to do the same.

286
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,480
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

287
00:19:10,481 --> 00:19:12,549
I'll let Jeanie know.

288
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,285
Uh, just a friend,
heard about the accident.

289
00:19:15,286 --> 00:19:19,029
Uh, I got to take care
of the arrangements.

290
00:19:22,093 --> 00:19:26,330
I think I've been there

291
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:31,769
I think I know just what
you're going through

292
00:19:37,542 --> 00:19:41,569
A fallen angel is what you are

293
00:19:42,981 --> 00:19:44,882
You're Richard Shellburn.

294
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:47,010
Yes, I am.

295
00:19:48,553 --> 00:19:49,953
I thought you'd look older.

296
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:52,650
Thought you would too.

297
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,133
You go to Temple University?

298
00:19:59,297 --> 00:20:00,631
No.

299
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,499
I graduated.

300
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,533
Journalism.

301
00:20:03,534 --> 00:20:05,435
Oh.

302
00:20:05,436 --> 00:20:06,603
Yeah.

303
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:08,438
Now I freelance, mostly sports.

304
00:20:08,439 --> 00:20:11,909
Who's Yama Bahama?

305
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,912
A fallen angel is what you are.

306
00:20:14,913 --> 00:20:17,188
Is that a name for your penis?

307
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:19,583
Jesus.

308
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:21,916
Everyone's got a name
for their penis.

309
00:20:28,793 --> 00:20:30,488
Mickey.

310
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:35,232
We're real sorry, Mick.

311
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:37,034
Leon was a good boy.

312
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:39,336
It don't make no sense to me.

313
00:20:39,337 --> 00:20:41,805
I mean, somebody ought
to do something.

314
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:45,105
The youth is our
hope for the future.

315
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:52,649
What happened?

316
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:54,751
I don't know.

317
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:57,454
They say something
dropped on him..

318
00:20:57,455 --> 00:20:59,022
down at the job.

319
00:20:59,023 --> 00:21:00,590
Jesus.

320
00:21:00,591 --> 00:21:02,125
That's a shame.

321
00:21:02,126 --> 00:21:05,429
Got to go see Smilin' Jack,
make arrangements.

322
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,466
Jeanie's messed up.

323
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:12,336
Well, Saturday's a good day
for a funeral, always.

324
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:14,604
Nobody has to get up the next day.

325
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:15,772
Mm.

326
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:18,608
We're collecting for the funeral.

327
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:22,179
Fuckin' Leon's gonna cost
me more dead than alive.

328
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,082
He was always a nice youngster.

329
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,717
Tell Jeanie that for me.

330
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:27,918
For Christ's sakes, Eleanor.

331
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,286
You didn't even know him.

332
00:21:29,287 --> 00:21:31,021
That's a damnable lie!

333
00:21:31,022 --> 00:21:33,724
I know all our youngsters!

334
00:21:33,725 --> 00:21:35,692
He was nice back then, Mickey.

335
00:21:35,693 --> 00:21:38,095
He never broke into nobody's
house in the neighborhood..

336
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:39,663
Eleanor!

337
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,933
Are you gonna sit down,
or I got to pour out your drink?

338
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:44,101
I mean it today.

339
00:21:44,102 --> 00:21:45,335
I'm cutting you off!

340
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:48,874
Yeah, well, you can't
cut off the truth!

341
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:54,081
Fuckin' neighborhood.

342
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:04,454
Jack.

343
00:22:04,455 --> 00:22:05,945
Mickey.

344
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:11,395
I'm so sorry to hear about Leon.

345
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,562
Yeah.

346
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:14,698
You know, sometimes you
wonder about God's plan.

347
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,333
I just want to make
Jeanie feel better.

348
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:18,245
Let me show you what we got, Mick.

349
00:22:34,819 --> 00:22:36,696
This is our best seller..

350
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:40,624
mahogany veneer,
champagne interior.

351
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:43,226
What about that one?

352
00:22:43,227 --> 00:22:45,629
Well, of course, you
know Jeanie best,

353
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,167
but she ain't gonna want
some piece of junk.

354
00:22:50,568 --> 00:22:52,002
I got to think it over.

355
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,336
Mick..

356
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:55,672
we'll work something out.

357
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:58,909
I just don't want to give her
anything that she ain't gonna like.

358
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,912
Well, how about I stop
over tomorrow morning?

359
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,482
It might be easier for her to talk
about it in familiar surroundings.

360
00:23:05,483 --> 00:23:07,758
I guess so.

361
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:16,126
Yo, Mick.

362
00:23:16,127 --> 00:23:18,829
Was the body messed up?

363
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,163
No, his body's fine.

364
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,766
It's just the back of his head.

365
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:24,534
That's no problem at all.

366
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:27,436
The back of the head
takes care of itself.

367
00:23:39,817 --> 00:23:41,451
Leon didn't take no shit.

368
00:23:41,452 --> 00:23:45,764
If I was a father, that's what
I'd want my kid to be like.

369
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,429
You know what I did the
day my mother died?

370
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,765
I went out and I banged
a Locust Street whore.

371
00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:57,134
Remember those girls?

372
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:58,301
No.

373
00:23:58,302 --> 00:23:59,603
I got home at 1:00 in the morning.

374
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,972
My whole family was
waiting up for me.

375
00:24:01,973 --> 00:24:04,641
It was the Christians and
the lions all over again.

376
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:06,769
On the day your mother died?

377
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:10,849
I felt bad, but I had
to do something.

378
00:24:13,384 --> 00:24:15,652
What the fuck you doing, man?

379
00:24:15,653 --> 00:24:17,654
Fuck you.

380
00:24:17,655 --> 00:24:19,289
Fuck him!

381
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:21,124
Hey, what the fuck is
wrong with you guys?

382
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,826
- You're always doing that!
- Play the game.

383
00:24:22,827 --> 00:24:24,261
- Get out of here!
- Sit down!

384
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:26,029
- Got a problem?
- Get the hell out of here!

385
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:27,197
Fuck him!

386
00:24:27,198 --> 00:24:29,199
I got to get the fuck out of here.

387
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,259
Your fucking shoe.

388
00:24:37,842 --> 00:24:39,809
You had a lot of
those screwdrivers.

389
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,983
18.

390
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:45,882
But you drank one.

391
00:24:45,883 --> 00:24:48,488
That's why I can't get it up.

392
00:24:49,854 --> 00:24:52,722
Could you always write?

393
00:24:52,723 --> 00:24:55,425
I mean, did you always
want to be a writer?

394
00:24:55,426 --> 00:24:56,760
What?

395
00:24:56,761 --> 00:25:00,492
Do you think sometime I could watch
you write one of your columns?

396
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,372
Sometime.

397
00:25:35,366 --> 00:25:37,061
Oh.

398
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,494
It is the damndest thing.

399
00:25:57,221 --> 00:26:00,065
I can't remember which
one of you is which.

400
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,426
What time is it?

401
00:26:03,427 --> 00:26:06,271
Closing time.

402
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,433
You been drinking?

403
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,601
Yeah.

404
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:13,937
Tonight you've been out drinking?

405
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:16,373
And don't go in Jeanie's room.

406
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,642
The doctor had to come twice
to give her medicine,

407
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:20,677
and he said that she needs
a good night's sleep.

408
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:22,712
I thought maybe she
might want someone..

409
00:26:22,713 --> 00:26:24,658
Joyce is in there with her.

410
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,687
So you're Joanie.

411
00:27:04,488 --> 00:27:06,222
Aah! Oh, Jesus.

412
00:27:06,223 --> 00:27:08,020
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- What?

413
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,161
Oh, my God.

414
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,662
It's all right. It's all right.

415
00:27:12,663 --> 00:27:13,963
I thought I saw Leon!

416
00:27:13,964 --> 00:27:16,132
Oh, my God!

417
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,169
It's all right.

418
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:26,242
Now, last but perhaps not least,

419
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:28,678
I feel obliged to show you
the blue-gauge steel.

420
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,548
In my opinion, uh, I think..

421
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,510
I think she likes the mahogany.

422
00:27:39,957 --> 00:27:45,368
Now, do you have a particular
suit in mind for the service?

423
00:27:50,067 --> 00:27:52,365
Come upstairs.

424
00:27:57,108 --> 00:27:58,905
Voilà.

425
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:02,412
Jesus Christ.

426
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,620
It's a fucking men's shop.

427
00:28:07,451 --> 00:28:10,820
You know, I never owned
anything you couldn't put

428
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:13,990
in a fucking drawer
till I met Jeanie.

429
00:28:13,991 --> 00:28:16,893
You suppose all this shit is hot?

430
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,738
You learn in my business
not to question.

431
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,035
So the 6 grand, can I put
it on layaway or what?

432
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:29,506
You want me to tell Jeanie
you want something cheaper?

433
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:30,540
Hey, I'm just..

434
00:28:30,541 --> 00:28:32,748
This should be all I need.

435
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,582
Something happened to
Leon over at that job,

436
00:28:39,583 --> 00:28:42,689
something nobody's told us yet.

437
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:46,823
Anybody tell you anything
you didn't tell me?

438
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:52,028
All they told me was that something
dropped and hit him on the skull.

439
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:54,030
That's the whole thing.

440
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:56,533
Something else happened.

441
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:58,377
It did.

442
00:28:59,203 --> 00:29:01,046
Okay.

443
00:29:02,706 --> 00:29:05,074
I'll see what I can find out.

444
00:29:05,075 --> 00:29:06,838
Okay?

445
00:29:10,114 --> 00:29:11,752
Hey, Mick.

446
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:13,783
The power's back on.

447
00:29:13,784 --> 00:29:15,351
Let's get that meat cut for you.

448
00:29:15,352 --> 00:29:16,519
Listen, Bird..

449
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:18,421
I appreciate you taking
it instead of the cash.

450
00:29:18,422 --> 00:29:20,056
We'll get all this shit
straightened out.

451
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:21,090
Don't you worry.

452
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,892
Hey.

453
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:25,771
Look it, queers, huh?

454
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:28,131
Remember in school when
they said you was queer

455
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:29,599
if you wore yellow on Tuesday?

456
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,296
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I heard all day.

457
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:34,871
I forgot you ain't from here.

458
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,773
You missed a lot of
great shit, Mick.

459
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:38,675
Hey, Tony! Come here.

460
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,176
This is my nephew.

461
00:29:40,177 --> 00:29:42,278
Say hello to Bird's main man.

462
00:29:42,279 --> 00:29:44,347
Hmm? He don't talk much.

463
00:29:44,348 --> 00:29:46,649
But this little fucker
can cut meat.

464
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,219
Take the meat out of Mickey's truck
and cut it up for him, all right?

465
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,916
Do a nice job. Don't
sneeze on it or nothing.

466
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:55,191
Listen, Mick. I made up my mind.

467
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:57,888
That horse, Turning Leaf?

468
00:29:58,562 --> 00:29:59,996
She's gonna come in tomorrow.

469
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,197
Nice horse.

470
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:02,532
She's running with a
bunch of shit too.

471
00:30:02,533 --> 00:30:03,933
She's a lock.

472
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:06,903
Bird, there's nothing weighs half a ton
with little bitty ankles that's a lock.

473
00:30:06,904 --> 00:30:08,271
Hey, I'm trying to
help you out here,

474
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:09,739
but if you don't want
to listen, it's on you.

475
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,741
You want to help me?
I need that $700.

476
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,243
Hey, all I got is this horse.

477
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,678
Smilin' Jack ain't exactly
giving away funerals.

478
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,013
Jesus, the funeral.

479
00:30:17,014 --> 00:30:19,349
I..I forgot.

480
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,783
How's Jeanie doing?

481
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:24,954
She's got some idea that something
else happened down there to Leon.

482
00:30:24,955 --> 00:30:28,758
I don't know where the fuck
it came from, but there it is.

483
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:30,593
Yeah, fucking Leon.

484
00:30:30,594 --> 00:30:31,628
Yeah.

485
00:30:31,629 --> 00:30:35,398
Actually, I was hoping you..
you'd ask around for me.

486
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:36,432
Yeah.

487
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,560
You mean you want
me to talk to Sal?

488
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:45,508
I..I hate to ask, but Jeanie
ain't gonna let go on this one.

489
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:49,345
I'll do it for you.

490
00:30:49,346 --> 00:30:50,346
You got my word.

491
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,681
- All right.
- Oh.

492
00:30:51,682 --> 00:30:54,183
- What the fuck?
- Come on.

493
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:56,419
We ought to sue these
motherfuckers.

494
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:59,088
"A 22-year-old construction
worker was killed yesterday"

495
00:30:59,089 --> 00:31:00,823
"when he slipped and
fell to his death."

496
00:31:00,824 --> 00:31:02,325
Leon Hubbard didn't
slip on nothing.

497
00:31:02,326 --> 00:31:04,727
They're laying block down there.
Where was there to fall?

498
00:31:04,728 --> 00:31:06,996
Jeez, you look worse than I do.

499
00:31:06,997 --> 00:31:08,631
Everybody in the fucking
city's gonna think

500
00:31:08,632 --> 00:31:09,999
we're a bunch of
jerk-offs down here,

501
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,730
walking around falling
off shit all the time.

502
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:16,005
I'm gonna call these motherfuckers.

503
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:17,273
And they fucked up his age.

504
00:31:17,274 --> 00:31:19,606
He was a year ahead
of me in school.

505
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:26,186
1,440 bucks.

506
00:31:28,452 --> 00:31:30,090
Yeah?

507
00:31:41,765 --> 00:31:44,393
Let me have the bag back sometime.

508
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:48,237
Yeah.

509
00:31:48,238 --> 00:31:49,910
Thank you.

510
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,075
Cheers.

511
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,276
Cheers.

512
00:31:53,277 --> 00:31:54,767
Thank you.

513
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:08,458
Richard.

514
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,959
Huh?

515
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,829
Brookie here. You feeling better?

516
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,864
Well..

517
00:32:14,865 --> 00:32:17,967
I'm lying here with a..

518
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:20,403
jaybird-naked-ass girl graduate

519
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:23,306
of the Temple University
School of Journalism.

520
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,208
I'm glad to hear it. How was she?

521
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:28,411
Well, if you get off the phone,
I'll try and find out for you.

522
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:31,614
Did you notice that you weren't
in the paper again this morning?

523
00:32:31,615 --> 00:32:32,815
Why?

524
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,251
I gave you my anniversary
column yesterday.

525
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:38,721
And I enjoyed it, just like I did
last year and the year before that.

526
00:32:38,722 --> 00:32:41,691
You've written the same anniversary
column four different times.

527
00:32:41,692 --> 00:32:44,494
I could write the same column
every day and get away with it.

528
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,163
I need a favor.

529
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:50,833
We ran a story about a kid got
killed on a construction job,

530
00:32:50,834 --> 00:32:52,502
and somehow we fucked it all up.

531
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:54,103
Is this really important, Brookie?

532
00:32:54,104 --> 00:32:56,139
I mean, she got my
dick in her mouth.

533
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,840
So I'm thinking, "Why don't I ask"

534
00:32:57,841 --> 00:32:59,442
"Richard Shellburn to go down there"

535
00:32:59,443 --> 00:33:02,111
"and write me a column about
that boy and get it done right?"

536
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:05,281
- Bibles, pictures..
- I really.. I can't talk now.

537
00:33:05,282 --> 00:33:07,617
I'm eating pussy.

538
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:11,759
182125th street, God's Pocket.

539
00:33:17,861 --> 00:33:19,796
Thank you for listening.

540
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:21,364
I'll get you some more coffee.

541
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,162
It's my pleasure.

542
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,673
This is my husband.

543
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:39,782
We'll be in touch.

544
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:41,617
Sorry for your loss.

545
00:33:41,618 --> 00:33:43,853
We're still investigating
the accident.

546
00:33:43,854 --> 00:33:45,688
We'll get back to you
when we're finished.

547
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:47,782
Thank you, Officer.

548
00:33:57,701 --> 00:33:59,669
So what did they say?

549
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:00,970
They were nice.

550
00:34:00,971 --> 00:34:03,599
They said they'd go back to
the yard and talk to the men.

551
00:34:07,644 --> 00:34:09,579
Something happened.

552
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,673
How do you know that, Jeanie?

553
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:14,923
I don't know, but I know.

554
00:34:26,430 --> 00:34:28,264
Sal. How you doing?

555
00:34:28,265 --> 00:34:29,732
You got my money?

556
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,367
Hey, the electric went out.

557
00:34:31,368 --> 00:34:34,203
As soon as I get the meat cut,
get it out, everybody gets paid.

558
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:37,473
All right, don't
fuck around, Arthur.

559
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:38,975
Sal.

560
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,477
Hey, I got a..

561
00:34:41,478 --> 00:34:43,924
a favor to ask.

562
00:34:47,217 --> 00:34:50,353
This kid got killed at
the block yard downtown.

563
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:52,155
His mother's going crazy.

564
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,190
They ain't telling
her what happened.

565
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,726
What's this to me?

566
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,494
The mother's married to a
guy who works for me..

567
00:34:58,495 --> 00:34:59,896
Mickey, the guy who took the truck?

568
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:00,963
Yeah.

569
00:35:00,964 --> 00:35:03,166
Maybe you could send a
couple of guys down there,

570
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:05,701
bounce somebody around
so they talk to you.

571
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:07,270
Nothing's gonna happen down there?

572
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,538
Nah.

573
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:09,939
Just a couple guys to push around?

574
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,510
That's it.

575
00:35:12,976 --> 00:35:14,110
All right.

576
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:15,912
For a point on top of
what you already owe.

577
00:35:15,913 --> 00:35:17,947
Fine.

578
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:19,791
Whatever you want.

579
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:22,718
And, Arthur, don't fuck around.

580
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:23,920
Okay.

581
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,689
Hey. Make sure you get my money.

582
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:29,158
You'll get it. You'll get it.

583
00:35:29,159 --> 00:35:31,002
You'll get it.

584
00:35:34,865 --> 00:35:37,333
It was an accident.

585
00:35:37,334 --> 00:35:39,135
That's..

586
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,037
all there is to it.

587
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:45,308
Kid was the wrong person
at the wrong place.

588
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:48,938
Cops get the.. n..nigger?

589
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,347
You ain't grown enough

590
00:35:51,348 --> 00:35:54,647
to call that old man a nigger.

591
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:02,358
Old Lucy will be back
when he's ready.

592
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:04,452
All right, let's go.

593
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:56,115
I'll have a beer.

594
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:20,066
She don't even care about me

595
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:23,372
Is that Leon Hubbard's
house across the street?

596
00:37:23,373 --> 00:37:25,775
You're aren't Richard
Shellburn, are you?

597
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,543
Mm..hmm.

598
00:37:27,544 --> 00:37:30,379
I..I read you every day.

599
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:34,116
Yeah, you're different from your
picture, but I knew it was you.

600
00:37:34,117 --> 00:37:36,118
It's me.

601
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,920
So is that the Hubbard place?

602
00:37:37,921 --> 00:37:40,389
- Scarpato.
- Oh.

603
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,391
The mother remarried.
Jeanie Scarpato.

604
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:45,227
How's she taking it?

605
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:48,097
Well, it was her only child.

606
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:52,034
Mr. Shellburn, you're the only
one that knows what it's like

607
00:37:52,035 --> 00:37:53,736
down here in the Pocket.

608
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:56,729
God bless you.

609
00:38:05,148 --> 00:38:06,315
Another?

610
00:38:06,316 --> 00:38:07,383
Thank you.

611
00:38:07,384 --> 00:38:08,551
It's the mother.

612
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:10,820
The mother thinks
something happened.

613
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:13,312
What does she think?

614
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,096
You missing somebody today
besides Leon Hubbard?

615
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,497
Seems like there was an old man.

616
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,866
He was sitting against the wall.

617
00:38:23,867 --> 00:38:26,102
That's Old Lucy.

618
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:28,437
Some days, he comes in,
and some days, he don't.

619
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:30,639
He does as much work either way.

620
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,767
He's about 100 years old.

621
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,012
Look.

622
00:38:36,013 --> 00:38:38,347
That mother, she's got something.

623
00:38:38,348 --> 00:38:39,782
She could look at you a certain way

624
00:38:39,783 --> 00:38:41,917
and you'd stick a fork in your leg.

625
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:45,287
They say that her
husband is connected.

626
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:48,257
If that's true, that might be
where your problem comes from.

627
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,961
Either way, she's got
his balls in a blender.

628
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,429
You can see that.

629
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:56,198
And there ain't no telling
what anybody will do

630
00:38:56,199 --> 00:38:57,366
with his balls in a blender.

631
00:38:57,367 --> 00:38:59,642
Fuckin' write it down or something.

632
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:16,614
Hi.

633
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:19,150
All right.

634
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,565
Same race it was last night, Bird.

635
00:39:29,566 --> 00:39:32,802
I don't like this other
filly, the 6 horse.

636
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,870
She scares me.

637
00:39:34,871 --> 00:39:36,639
She got a decent workout last week.

638
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,706
So?

639
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:40,476
- Put her at the bottom of an exacta.
- I don't like her.

640
00:39:40,477 --> 00:39:42,945
This horse can beat Turning
Leaf, the 6 horse.

641
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:44,280
Your nerves are eating
your brain, Bird.

642
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:46,982
- I am telling you, Mick..
- Bird, if Turning Leaf runs at all,

643
00:39:46,983 --> 00:39:50,979
there's nothing in that fucking dog
kennel that's gonna catch her.

644
00:39:52,889 --> 00:39:54,223
How much you got there?

645
00:39:54,224 --> 00:39:55,791
Whatever I could
get my hands on it.

646
00:39:55,792 --> 00:39:58,094
I borrowed some of
Sophie's flower money.

647
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,428
Feel terrible.

648
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,697
Turning Leaf, eight-to-one.

649
00:40:01,698 --> 00:40:04,200
You'll feel better once
you place your bet.

650
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,868
I'm telling you, Mick.

651
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:06,969
It's the 6 horse.

652
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:09,939
Jesus, Bird.

653
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,540
I'll be right back. Stay here.

654
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,907
Don't do anything fucking crazy.

655
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:22,551
Number 3 horse,
Turning Leaf, to win.

656
00:40:22,552 --> 00:40:24,611
45 times.

657
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:40,106
Hey.

658
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,776
You the boss?

659
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:48,978
I'm the only one here.

660
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:51,113
That's a fact.

661
00:40:51,114 --> 00:40:53,415
The thing is, somebody got
killed here yesterday,

662
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,952
and there's some feeling it didn't
happen the way the cops said.

663
00:40:56,953 --> 00:41:00,556
So we were wondering if, uh, maybe
you were here when it happened.

664
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:04,059
'Cause the guy who got it,
he was an important guy.

665
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,857
Huh.

666
00:41:08,965 --> 00:41:11,456
He always said he was important.

667
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:14,963
So how do you want to do this?

668
00:41:18,508 --> 00:41:21,277
It happened the way
I said to the police.

669
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:25,114
And you Jew boys can do
it any damn way you want.

670
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,815
It don't matter to me.

671
00:41:26,816 --> 00:41:28,184
"Jew boys."

672
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,852
Now, why you want to do that?

673
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:31,487
Did we insult you in any way?

674
00:41:31,488 --> 00:41:33,556
Huh?

675
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:34,924
Come on.

676
00:41:34,925 --> 00:41:36,625
Let's go somewhere we can talk.

677
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:38,127
Hit him, Ronnie.

678
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,096
Fucking hit him!

679
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,173
Oh, God!

680
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,751
You didn't bet the
6 horse, did you?

681
00:42:02,752 --> 00:42:04,253
Well..

682
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:07,394
You're fucking crazy.

683
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:13,395
And they're off at Keystone,
$15,000 claiming race.

684
00:42:13,396 --> 00:42:16,765
The number 4 horse, One Hit
Wonder, takes an early lead.

685
00:42:16,766 --> 00:42:18,867
My Oh Might tucked in at the rail

686
00:42:18,868 --> 00:42:21,770
and Shana Three coming
up between the horses.

687
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:24,473
No Man's Land moves
up on the outside.

688
00:42:24,474 --> 00:42:27,676
One Hit Wonder, Shana
Three, No Man's Land.

689
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,411
My Oh Might makes a
move on the inside.

690
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:33,249
One Hit Wonder, Shana Three,
and into third, Turning Leaf.

691
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,584
Turning Leaf stiff moving
up to the second spot.

692
00:42:35,585 --> 00:42:39,888
One Hit Wonder, Turning
Leaf, Shana Three.

693
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:41,523
We're into the far turn,

694
00:42:41,524 --> 00:42:44,226
and it's One Hit Wonder
showing the lead by a length

695
00:42:44,227 --> 00:42:45,394
with Turning Leaf..

696
00:42:45,395 --> 00:42:46,562
Come on, you motherfucker.

697
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,298
One Hit Wonder, Turning Leaf.

698
00:42:49,299 --> 00:42:51,066
And it's Turning Leaf pulling in.

699
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:52,868
- Come on!
- Yes!

700
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:56,538
And at the top of the lane, it's
Turning Leaf moving into first.

701
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:59,174
Turning Leaf-One, Hit Wonder
holding on to second.

702
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:01,343
Please.

703
00:43:01,344 --> 00:43:04,213
And passing the number 5 horse
is Holmesdale, the number 6.

704
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,616
Turning Leaf, One Hit
Wonder, and Holmesdale

705
00:43:07,617 --> 00:43:09,710
racing up on the outside.

706
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:14,223
Turning Leaf,
Holmesdale on the outside.

707
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:15,457
It's the 6.

708
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,859
Turning Leaf, Holmesdale..

709
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,094
they fight it out,
and it's Holmesdale.

710
00:43:19,095 --> 00:43:21,586
- Ohh!
- No.

711
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:30,406
I..I tried to tell you, Mick.

712
00:43:30,407 --> 00:43:32,250
It was the 6.

713
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:35,539
Mm.

714
00:43:59,269 --> 00:44:01,510
Hello?

715
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:09,420
Can I help you?

716
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:16,452
Uh, I'm looking for Mrs. Scarpato.

717
00:44:16,453 --> 00:44:18,354
Yes.

718
00:44:18,355 --> 00:44:20,923
You're Mrs. Scarpato?

719
00:44:20,924 --> 00:44:22,491
Yes.

720
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:23,792
I'm sorry.

721
00:44:23,793 --> 00:44:25,127
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:25,128 --> 00:44:26,962
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:29,031
Uh..

724
00:44:29,032 --> 00:44:32,067
I'm Richard Shellburn
of The Daily Times.

725
00:44:32,068 --> 00:44:33,235
Oh, my.

726
00:44:33,236 --> 00:44:35,727
Uh, please come in.

727
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:44,618
This one makes his ears
look bigger than they were.

728
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,282
Oh.

729
00:44:52,489 --> 00:44:54,787
I'm so sorry for your loss.

730
00:44:55,592 --> 00:44:57,893
It didn't happen like
they said it happened.

731
00:44:57,894 --> 00:45:00,295
There's something wrong with it.

732
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:04,107
I knew Leon, and he was my boy.

733
00:45:11,508 --> 00:45:13,419
I know.

734
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:28,556
Mr. Shellburn?

735
00:45:42,372 --> 00:45:46,081
So, um, what..
what kind of boy was he?

736
00:45:49,546 --> 00:45:51,847
Hey.

737
00:45:51,848 --> 00:45:55,083
What was that job, uh,
yesterday.. 700?

738
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:57,019
It's old business. I took the meat.

739
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,086
Fuck that.

740
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:59,188
Here.

741
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:00,856
I took the meat. Keep your money.

742
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:02,024
Take 7.

743
00:46:02,025 --> 00:46:03,859
- Take 10, for the interest.
- Bird.

744
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,527
Look, I got maybe 12 grand here.

745
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:07,062
I owe Sal 20.

746
00:46:07,063 --> 00:46:10,362
But if I give him 10, maybe
he'll lay off for a while.

747
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:16,138
7?

748
00:46:16,139 --> 00:46:17,709
All right.

749
00:46:21,177 --> 00:46:24,112
Thinking of taking
Sophie to Florida.

750
00:46:24,113 --> 00:46:26,114
She wants to live in one
of those trailer parks

751
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:29,744
with her friends, grow
some shit in the yard.

752
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:38,249
Jack.

753
00:46:38,828 --> 00:46:41,997
Jesus, God. You scared
the piss out of me.

754
00:46:41,998 --> 00:46:44,000
Oh, shit.

755
00:46:45,201 --> 00:46:48,079
You think people are gonna
smell this shit on her?

756
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:51,573
Irish funeral.

757
00:46:51,574 --> 00:46:54,748
Listen, uh, I got a
problem with the money.

758
00:46:56,246 --> 00:46:57,846
Oh, that's too bad.

759
00:46:57,847 --> 00:47:01,183
Yeah, it's nothing permanent,
but if we have the service,

760
00:47:01,184 --> 00:47:02,918
I could pay you back
in a couple weeks,

761
00:47:02,919 --> 00:47:06,655
and if I can't get it back to
you then, I'll sell the truck.

762
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:08,657
How much money you got?

763
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:10,192
700.

764
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:12,194
What about the fucking
money from The Hollywood?

765
00:47:12,195 --> 00:47:13,495
There was more than 700 there.

766
00:47:13,496 --> 00:47:15,497
Things happen.
I'll get you the money.

767
00:47:15,498 --> 00:47:17,833
I just.. I..I got to
have the funeral,

768
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,075
and Jeanie's fucked
up over all this.

769
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,670
That's nothing to me.

770
00:47:21,671 --> 00:47:24,239
It's your fuckin' woman and your
fuckin' body unless I get paid.

771
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,374
Don't get hysterical.

772
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:26,842
I don't need my
business on the street.

773
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:28,277
You ain't got no fucking business.

774
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,979
What you got is
something on the side.

775
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:32,080
No.

776
00:47:32,081 --> 00:47:33,715
No, you bet a game, right?

777
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:35,284
You bet a fucking game.

778
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,286
What I did has nothing
to do with you,

779
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:38,787
and what you got to worry about

780
00:47:38,788 --> 00:47:41,356
is making sure that everything's
all right Saturday,

781
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:44,293
and then you get your money.

782
00:47:44,294 --> 00:47:46,228
Sure, Mick.

783
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:48,330
Sure.

784
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:49,998
Yeah.

785
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:51,667
Don't look at me like that, Jack.

786
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:52,834
W..what?

787
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:54,436
What are you talking about..
look at you?

788
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:56,473
- Don't look at me like that.
- What?

789
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:00,309
Oh.

790
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:02,377
Motherfucker!

791
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:05,108
No need to panic.

792
00:48:06,115 --> 00:48:09,418
I'll pay you back in a couple
weeks, a month on the outside.

793
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:11,478
You understand?

794
00:48:12,388 --> 00:48:13,622
I'm sorry, Mick.

795
00:48:13,623 --> 00:48:15,659
I don't know what's wrong with me.

796
00:48:16,859 --> 00:48:19,396
Let me.. let me go get us a beer.

797
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,841
Leon always loved animals,
ever since he was a little boy.

798
00:48:32,842 --> 00:48:36,437
He always wanted a dog
or a cat or something.

799
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,392
I used to think it would be nice to
live out in the country and have a few.

800
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:45,176
Think that country air would..

801
00:48:50,627 --> 00:48:53,228
Mr. Shellburn?

802
00:48:53,229 --> 00:48:56,498
I have a place by the water.

803
00:48:56,499 --> 00:49:00,814
I've had it for a very long
time, and nobody knows.

804
00:49:17,053 --> 00:49:22,257
I go there sometimes at
night, I drink too much,

805
00:49:22,258 --> 00:49:24,226
and I wake up with the birds,

806
00:49:24,227 --> 00:49:27,253
and things are growing
everywhere you look.

807
00:49:50,186 --> 00:49:52,962
Do you need to know
anything else about Leon?

808
00:50:08,137 --> 00:50:10,005
Yo, Mick.

809
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,074
I don't know what got
into me. I was wrong.

810
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:14,009
I need this done right.

811
00:50:14,010 --> 00:50:15,444
We'll take care of it.

812
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:17,936
You and me got no arguments, Mick.

813
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,083
I hope you don't mind
going out the side.

814
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:22,250
I'm locked up in front.

815
00:50:22,251 --> 00:50:23,741
I don't mind nothing.

816
00:50:28,758 --> 00:50:31,093
I got to get this light fixed.

817
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:32,427
It's getting cold.

818
00:50:32,428 --> 00:50:34,271
Yeah, it's a cold world.

819
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:55,909
What the fuck?

820
00:51:07,163 --> 00:51:09,734
Holy shit.

821
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:21,132
Oh, Jesus, Leon.

822
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:27,485
I need to know what
happened to my boy, please.

823
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:30,679
Oh, um..

824
00:52:30,680 --> 00:52:32,314
can I call you tomorrow?

825
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,983
Yes, please.

826
00:52:34,984 --> 00:52:36,318
Thank you, Mr. Shellburn.

827
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,378
Okay.

828
00:52:40,089 --> 00:52:42,364
Jeanie?

829
00:52:46,229 --> 00:52:49,039
I'm up here with Richard Shellburn.

830
00:52:57,206 --> 00:52:59,697
He wanted to see Leon's room.

831
00:53:03,946 --> 00:53:05,947
Richard Shellburn,
this is my husband.

832
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:09,361
Oh, um, yeah,
I'm sorry for your loss.

833
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:16,892
Um, you know, I think that's, uh..

834
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,362
I think it's all I need,
uh, for now.

835
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,731
Anything, please. If you
need anything, call me.

836
00:53:22,732 --> 00:53:23,798
Okay.

837
00:53:23,799 --> 00:53:25,300
It's all I have to do.

838
00:53:25,301 --> 00:53:27,337
All right.

839
00:53:35,678 --> 00:53:38,704
Jeanie, there's something
I need to tell you.

840
00:53:43,419 --> 00:53:44,989
Jeanie.

841
00:53:55,731 --> 00:53:57,403
Jeanie.

842
00:54:49,652 --> 00:54:52,787
Everything set for tomorrow?

843
00:54:52,788 --> 00:54:55,120
All set.

844
00:54:55,858 --> 00:54:59,089
Just a few last-minute details.

845
00:55:06,802 --> 00:55:07,936
Where's Arthur?

846
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:10,572
Who?

847
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:11,773
Where is he?

848
00:55:11,774 --> 00:55:14,909
This is the way you do business..
scaring an old woman?

849
00:55:14,910 --> 00:55:17,712
Oh, now.. now you're
gonna steal from me?

850
00:55:17,713 --> 00:55:18,813
He's in the back.

851
00:55:18,814 --> 00:55:19,914
Want me go around back?

852
00:55:19,915 --> 00:55:21,449
Yeah, he can't run,
but what the fuck?

853
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:22,817
Well, he's.. he's got the money.

854
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:24,285
He told me.

855
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:26,121
This ain't about the money.

856
00:55:26,122 --> 00:55:27,789
You see my cousin out there?

857
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:29,624
Yesterday he had two eyes.

858
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:32,627
Now he's gonna have a piece of glass in
his fucking head the rest of his life.

859
00:55:32,628 --> 00:55:34,362
Without Arthur, what's
gonna happen to me?

860
00:55:34,363 --> 00:55:37,469
If I were you, I'd shut my mouth.

861
00:55:40,836 --> 00:55:42,170
Run for your life, Arthur!

862
00:55:42,171 --> 00:55:44,973
What the fuck?

863
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:47,670
Oh!

864
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,013
Sophie!

865
00:55:52,014 --> 00:55:53,948
What are you doing, Sophie?

866
00:55:53,949 --> 00:55:55,746
One second.

867
00:55:58,721 --> 00:56:00,757
Oh.

868
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:04,125
This is my family, you hear me?

869
00:56:04,126 --> 00:56:06,061
- You little fuck!
- No, no, no, no!

870
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,495
I'll fucking kill you, you fuck!

871
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:08,596
Arthur, Arthur, Arthur!

872
00:56:08,597 --> 00:56:10,331
- I'll kill you!
- Stop. Stop.

873
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:12,000
- Arthur, you're getting..
- Yeah!

874
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:14,536
You're getting blood all over
your pants. Just go change.

875
00:56:14,537 --> 00:56:16,704
- The cops will be here.
- I swear to Christ, Sophie,

876
00:56:16,705 --> 00:56:18,173
I didn't know nothing like
this was gonna happen.

877
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:19,240
Go change your pants.

878
00:56:19,241 --> 00:56:23,978
You don't want people taking pictures
of you looking like this. Right?

879
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:25,814
- Fuck.
- Arthur.

880
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,182
That fuck.

881
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:30,445
Arthur, this is not the time
to go wacko.. not now.

882
00:56:50,673 --> 00:56:52,173
Yeah, Operator?

883
00:56:52,174 --> 00:56:57,211
I want to, uh, report that two
men tried to rob my flower shop.

884
00:57:07,156 --> 00:57:09,329
Mickey left early.

885
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:12,863
He seemed different.

886
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:17,765
Hello.

887
00:57:17,766 --> 00:57:19,495
This is Richard Shellburn.

888
00:57:20,936 --> 00:57:22,881
Richard Shellburn.

889
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,710
Mr. Shellburn?

890
00:57:28,711 --> 00:57:31,813
Uh, we need to talk.

891
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:33,948
Did you find something out?

892
00:57:33,949 --> 00:57:35,792
I'D' pick you up.

893
00:57:39,221 --> 00:57:40,722
Where are we going?

894
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:43,224
We're almost there.

895
00:57:43,225 --> 00:57:45,102
Almost.

896
00:57:47,897 --> 00:57:50,932
It all looks the same, doesn't it?

897
00:57:50,933 --> 00:57:54,335
If you woke up here alone,
you'd never get back.

898
00:57:54,336 --> 00:57:56,827
Never want to.

899
00:58:28,871 --> 00:58:30,538
Hey, Nick.

900
00:58:30,539 --> 00:58:31,573
Got a minute?

901
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:33,041
I'm here.

902
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,209
I got some meat.

903
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:35,577
Thought maybe you could use some.

904
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:36,611
No.

905
00:58:36,612 --> 00:58:37,779
Well, how much you got?

906
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,881
Four sides, Kansas choice beef.

907
00:58:39,882 --> 00:58:41,049
No.

908
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:42,450
How much you want?

909
00:58:42,451 --> 00:58:44,686
$1,000. I don't got time
to fuck around with this.

910
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,020
You got it with you?

911
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,022
Yeah, let me take you
down a side to look at.

912
00:58:48,023 --> 00:58:50,059
I could look at it in the truck.

913
00:58:51,026 --> 00:58:52,694
I got some other shit in there.

914
00:58:52,695 --> 00:58:55,029
I don't care what you
got in your truck.

915
00:58:55,030 --> 00:58:57,365
I don't see nothing but meat
when I'm looking at meat.

916
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:59,067
Let me pull you down a side.

917
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:00,768
Eh, fuck it. I don't
think I want in on this.

918
00:59:00,769 --> 00:59:02,537
- All right, take a look.
- For Christ's sakes.

919
00:59:02,538 --> 00:59:03,905
- I don't see nothing..
- It's good beef.

920
00:59:03,906 --> 00:59:05,473
I don't see nothing but
what I'm looking at.

921
00:59:05,474 --> 00:59:07,317
Anything else is your own business.

922
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:10,945
Oh.

923
00:59:10,946 --> 00:59:12,480
This looks good, man.

924
00:59:12,481 --> 00:59:14,415
- What are you doing?
- Let me take a look at it.

925
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:16,054
You don't got to go up there.

926
00:59:24,994 --> 00:59:26,661
I'm just doing some guy
a favor, all right?

927
00:59:26,662 --> 00:59:29,028
Don't pay any attention
to that. It's nothing.

928
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:35,770
It's cold.

929
00:59:35,771 --> 00:59:37,105
It's a refrigerated truck.

930
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,306
What do you say, Nick?

931
00:59:38,307 --> 00:59:40,108
You gonna take it off
my hands or what?

932
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:42,710
It's a cheap suit.
What happened to him?

933
00:59:42,711 --> 00:59:44,201
He died.

934
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,882
I..I..I'm doing some guy a favor.

935
00:59:47,883 --> 00:59:49,784
I don't like this.

936
00:59:49,785 --> 00:59:51,686
You put me in a bad position.

937
00:59:51,687 --> 00:59:53,521
Because of you,
I'm an accessory now.

938
00:59:53,522 --> 00:59:55,590
You ain't nothing because
you ain't seen nothing.

939
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:57,258
I ain't taking that kind of meat.

940
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,160
Who knows what kind of
sickness it could have got

941
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:00,595
riding back here with a human body?

942
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:01,963
You're the one that wanted
to fucking look at it.

943
01:00:01,964 --> 01:00:03,298
I didn't want to see that.

944
01:00:03,299 --> 01:00:04,932
As a matter of fact,
I didn't see it.

945
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:07,268
I don't know nothing about it,
and you didn't come by today.

946
01:00:07,269 --> 01:00:08,436
Take the fucking meat.

947
01:00:08,437 --> 01:00:10,928
I ain't.. get the
fuck out of here.

948
01:00:23,018 --> 01:00:24,852
I thought when you told
me about this place,

949
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,548
you might have made it up.

950
01:00:28,657 --> 01:00:31,592
I bought this for my wife
without telling her.

951
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:36,324
That's before she realized
that she hated me.

952
01:00:37,966 --> 01:00:39,701
Okay.

953
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,869
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

954
01:00:41,870 --> 01:00:44,772
All right.

955
01:00:44,773 --> 01:00:47,549
This is where the living
room was supposed to be.

956
01:00:49,978 --> 01:00:52,276
It's a good view.

957
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,780
Shit.

958
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:20,838
Ah.

959
01:02:27,409 --> 01:02:29,582
I'm 60 years old.

960
01:02:32,948 --> 01:02:35,116
You don't look that old.

961
01:02:35,117 --> 01:02:37,351
Well..

962
01:02:37,352 --> 01:02:40,947
I'm 60 years old, and a
whole city loves me.

963
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,692
I get letters every
day from people..

964
01:02:44,693 --> 01:02:48,596
asking me to come to dinner,

965
01:02:48,597 --> 01:02:51,199
visit them in the Poconos.

966
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:53,862
Do you go?

967
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:57,104
No.

968
01:02:57,105 --> 01:02:59,710
Golf.. they want me to play golf.

969
01:03:06,081 --> 01:03:07,844
It's pretty.

970
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:12,378
It's actually beautiful.

971
01:03:13,455 --> 01:03:15,456
Tell me,

972
01:03:15,457 --> 01:03:18,259
how long would it take you

973
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:22,424
to get tired of having
a celebrity around?

974
01:03:25,133 --> 01:03:26,600
Mickey!

975
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:29,504
What, you come here to finally
sell me that truck, huh?

976
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:31,772
Yeah, yeah. I need
to get rid of it.

977
01:03:31,773 --> 01:03:33,074
Oh.

978
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,509
What's.. what's wrong with it?

979
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:35,843
Ah, nothing.

980
01:03:35,844 --> 01:03:38,279
Temporary financial problem.

981
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:39,580
Okay, well, what did you..

982
01:03:39,581 --> 01:03:41,458
what did you pay for that thing?

983
01:03:47,956 --> 01:03:50,436
Oh, my God, Mickey, they
saw you coming, huh?

984
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,028
And there's nothing wrong with it?

985
01:03:54,029 --> 01:03:55,596
60,000 miles on it.

986
01:03:55,597 --> 01:03:58,466
I check the oil, keep
it in the garage.

987
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,001
Now, you can start it up,

988
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:04,205
but I don't want
nobody taking it out.

989
01:04:04,206 --> 01:04:06,307
I got some stuff in the back.

990
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:08,342
I don't see nothing but what
I'm looking at, Mickey.

991
01:04:08,343 --> 01:04:09,644
You heard me.

992
01:04:09,645 --> 01:04:11,135
All right.

993
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:16,727
Stretch! Stretch!

994
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:23,524
It's hard to believe only two
days ago, Leon was alive.

995
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:27,029
Nothing works against
you like time.

996
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:29,827
Time's a bitch.

997
01:04:41,076 --> 01:04:43,567
Oh.

998
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:51,052
So you said you found
something out about Leon?

999
01:04:57,693 --> 01:04:59,860
My husband's gonna
wonder where I am.

1000
01:04:59,861 --> 01:05:01,696
Let me tell you about your husband.

1001
01:05:01,697 --> 01:05:05,666
He can put an air conditioner
into a wall all by himself

1002
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:07,635
or lift an engine block,

1003
01:05:07,636 --> 01:05:10,538
but he sits in that bar for
two hours every night,

1004
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:14,620
and then he comes home,
and he doesn't say jack shit.

1005
01:05:19,648 --> 01:05:23,152
He doesn't have the faintest
idea what to do with you.

1006
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:41,736
How long you had that thing?

1007
01:05:41,737 --> 01:05:44,137
About a year and a half.

1008
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:47,975
Well, you know, if everything
works out, Mickey,

1009
01:05:47,976 --> 01:05:51,045
you know, I could probably
get you, like, 5½, 6.

1010
01:05:51,046 --> 01:05:52,246
Yeah.

1011
01:05:52,247 --> 01:05:54,682
Yeah, because business sucks
in the summer, Mickey.

1012
01:05:54,683 --> 01:05:56,717
Everyone's thinking about pussy.

1013
01:05:56,718 --> 01:05:57,718
Hmm.

1014
01:05:57,719 --> 01:05:59,153
What the fuck?

1015
01:05:59,154 --> 01:06:01,322
He's just gonna make sure
that everything checks out.

1016
01:06:01,323 --> 01:06:02,823
What the fuck?

1017
01:06:02,824 --> 01:06:04,959
He'll be right back.
He's gonna be back in a sec..

1018
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,093
Mickey.

1019
01:06:06,094 --> 01:06:09,764
Mickey, I can't buy no truck without
taking it out for a drive first.

1020
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:12,063
You know that.

1021
01:06:13,235 --> 01:06:16,716
I really should be getting back.

1022
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:43,837
I'm not mad. I'm just running!

1023
01:06:47,536 --> 01:06:50,027
Wait a minute!

1024
01:06:51,473 --> 01:06:53,274
Stop!

1025
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,118
Stop!

1026
01:07:48,230 --> 01:07:50,364
This is my motherfucking meat.

1027
01:07:50,365 --> 01:07:53,095
Take it easy, lady.

1028
01:08:03,678 --> 01:08:07,175
Where the fuck did he think he
was going in a suit like that?

1029
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:34,975
Anyone see the vehicle
hit the victim?

1030
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:36,978
Jesus Christ.

1031
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,836
I love you.

1032
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:07,480
The moment that I laid eyes on
you, I was in love with you.

1033
01:09:18,753 --> 01:09:21,121
Where.. where's your truck?

1034
01:09:21,122 --> 01:09:23,023
It's wrecked.

1035
01:09:23,024 --> 01:09:24,291
Stretch?

1036
01:09:24,292 --> 01:09:26,658
I don't know.. hospital, I guess.

1037
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,163
You got insurance, Mick?

1038
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:31,765
I told you you could start it
but not to take it anywhere.

1039
01:09:31,766 --> 01:09:33,968
I got to try it before I buy it.

1040
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:35,502
You told me 6.

1041
01:09:35,503 --> 01:09:37,037
Oh, Mickey, I..

1042
01:09:37,038 --> 01:09:38,939
You know, I can't buy
something that's wrecked.

1043
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,207
I would love to help
you out, but I..

1044
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,085
You bought it already.

1045
01:09:44,112 --> 01:09:46,808
You know, technically, Mick..

1046
01:09:50,018 --> 01:09:54,894
That's for the mahogany box, the
funeral, and everything else, right?

1047
01:09:56,124 --> 01:09:57,992
Where's the deceased?

1048
01:09:57,993 --> 01:10:00,527
He's down at the morgue.
There was another accident.

1049
01:10:00,528 --> 01:10:01,595
When it rains, it pours.

1050
01:10:01,596 --> 01:10:04,298
Yeah, well, they got him down there.
They probably don't know who he is.

1051
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:07,635
- He wasn't carrying no identification.
- What the hell happened to you?

1052
01:10:07,636 --> 01:10:11,405
Can we take care of this tomorrow?
I want it done tomorrow.

1053
01:10:11,406 --> 01:10:14,068
Let me call down the
morgue and find out.

1054
01:10:15,410 --> 01:10:18,072
You know, this never
come up before.

1055
01:10:22,250 --> 01:10:24,218
Jeanie.

1056
01:10:25,587 --> 01:10:27,259
Jeanie.

1057
01:10:37,966 --> 01:10:39,099
Hello.

1058
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:40,234
Hey, Mick. It's Bird.

1059
01:10:40,235 --> 01:10:41,902
Yeah.

1060
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,504
You heard, right?

1061
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,505
What?

1062
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:46,040
You should have seen it.

1063
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:48,809
I didn't even know Sophie kept
that fucking thing loaded.

1064
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,477
What, Sal?

1065
01:10:50,478 --> 01:10:51,679
Yeah.

1066
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,516
Sophie and I are gonna
get out of here tonight.

1067
01:10:55,517 --> 01:10:58,118
I'll let you know where we end up.

1068
01:10:58,119 --> 01:10:59,848
Good luck, Mick.

1069
01:11:13,368 --> 01:11:15,369
What the hell happened to you?

1070
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:18,005
The funeral's tomorrow at 3:00.

1071
01:11:18,006 --> 01:11:20,140
If you wouldn't mind
letting people know?

1072
01:11:20,141 --> 01:11:21,508
That's good.

1073
01:11:21,509 --> 01:11:23,510
Saturday is a good
day for a funeral.

1074
01:11:23,511 --> 01:11:26,002
Small service at Jack's.

1075
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:38,192
Shame about the kid.

1076
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,684
The whole neighborhood was sorry.

1077
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:43,263
But they didn't live with him.

1078
01:11:43,264 --> 01:11:45,065
They don't know what
it's really like.

1079
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:46,400
That's the truth.

1080
01:11:46,401 --> 01:11:48,736
And they didn't live with Jeanie.

1081
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:51,171
They can say this or that.

1082
01:11:51,172 --> 01:11:53,299
It's all just talk.

1083
01:11:54,642 --> 01:11:56,485
What is?

1084
01:11:57,612 --> 01:11:59,780
Don't listen to them.

1085
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:03,592
Nobody in here went any
further than the 10th grade.

1086
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,787
What's just talk?

1087
01:12:06,788 --> 01:12:09,923
She was just riding in his car.

1088
01:12:09,924 --> 01:12:11,325
It doesn't mean anything.

1089
01:12:11,326 --> 01:12:13,327
What the fuck are
you talking about?

1090
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:17,031
The big thing is, you can
leave all of this behind.

1091
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:18,966
That's the beauty part.

1092
01:12:18,967 --> 01:12:20,434
Remember that.

1093
01:12:20,435 --> 01:12:22,436
You want to know why I
never got out of here?

1094
01:12:22,437 --> 01:12:25,736
What I want to know is
what everybody's saying.

1095
01:12:31,780 --> 01:12:32,780
Ray.

1096
01:12:32,781 --> 01:12:33,781
It's nothing.

1097
01:12:33,782 --> 01:12:35,783
I'm telling you.

1098
01:12:35,784 --> 01:12:37,729
Ray.

1099
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:44,400
That Jeanie's been fucking
Richard Shellburn.

1100
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:48,395
It's not what I think.

1101
01:12:48,396 --> 01:12:50,564
It's what they're saying.

1102
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:53,067
Come down off your throne

1103
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:54,802
And leave your body alone

1104
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:56,770
She ain't fucking nobody.

1105
01:12:56,771 --> 01:12:58,539
Somebody

1106
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:02,276
Must change

1107
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,777
She ain't.

1108
01:13:03,778 --> 01:13:07,881
I've been waiting so long

1109
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:11,952
Somebody holds the key

1110
01:13:11,953 --> 01:13:14,888
Well, I'm near the end

1111
01:13:14,889 --> 01:13:18,192
And I just ain't got the time

1112
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:20,227
She's got.. she's got some idea

1113
01:13:20,228 --> 01:13:23,730
that Leon died differently
than the cops said, is all.

1114
01:13:23,731 --> 01:13:24,832
He's helping her.

1115
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,333
What the fuck you
starting now, Ray?

1116
01:13:26,334 --> 01:13:27,401
We're just talking.

1117
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:30,204
Fuckin' funeral's tomorrow, and
you're talking shit like that?

1118
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,506
I didn't say anything everybody
else in here didn't say first.

1119
01:13:32,507 --> 01:13:35,442
Don't believe anything
this guy says.

1120
01:13:35,443 --> 01:13:38,011
Fuckin' people!

1121
01:13:38,012 --> 01:13:40,913
Talk about everything!

1122
01:13:42,617 --> 01:13:44,084
Last call!

1123
01:13:48,423 --> 01:13:49,923
It's not even time!

1124
01:13:49,924 --> 01:13:51,825
Right. Drink up.

1125
01:13:51,826 --> 01:13:53,794
Ooh, ooh

1126
01:13:53,795 --> 01:13:55,662
Ooh, ooh, ooh

1127
01:13:55,663 --> 01:13:57,764
But I can't find

1128
01:13:57,765 --> 01:14:01,335
My way home

1129
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:06,373
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1130
01:14:06,374 --> 01:14:12,079
But I can't find my way home

1131
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:17,084
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

1132
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:22,422
But I can't find my way home

1133
01:14:22,423 --> 01:14:24,057
Still I can't find

1134
01:14:24,058 --> 01:14:27,761
My way home

1135
01:14:27,762 --> 01:14:30,831
And I ain't done nothing

1136
01:14:30,832 --> 01:14:33,167
Wrong

1137
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:34,234
But I

1138
01:14:34,235 --> 01:14:41,835
Can't find my way home

1139
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:55,222
It's in the paper!

1140
01:14:55,223 --> 01:14:56,590
What?

1141
01:14:56,591 --> 01:14:59,193
That Leon was killed again.

1142
01:14:59,194 --> 01:15:00,694
What? Why would they say that?

1143
01:15:00,695 --> 01:15:04,164
Because they found his
body in the street!

1144
01:15:04,165 --> 01:15:07,612
Why did they find his body
in the street, Mickey?

1145
01:15:09,304 --> 01:15:11,972
I didn't have the money
to pay to bury Leon,

1146
01:15:11,973 --> 01:15:14,141
so I took the truck
to Little Eddie's,

1147
01:15:14,142 --> 01:15:18,045
but his guy took it out and
wrecked it, and Leon fell out.

1148
01:15:18,046 --> 01:15:20,747
What?

1149
01:15:20,748 --> 01:15:22,955
What?

1150
01:15:24,886 --> 01:15:27,218
Leon was in the truck.

1151
01:15:28,523 --> 01:15:30,218
No.

1152
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:33,727
With the meat?

1153
01:15:33,728 --> 01:15:35,896
He was separated from the meat.

1154
01:15:35,897 --> 01:15:37,865
I knew that would upset you.

1155
01:15:38,866 --> 01:15:40,601
Where is he now?

1156
01:15:40,602 --> 01:15:42,936
He's at Jack's.

1157
01:15:42,937 --> 01:15:45,239
And it's all settled.

1158
01:15:45,240 --> 01:15:47,207
He was just a baby!

1159
01:15:47,208 --> 01:15:49,876
And it's in the paper.

1160
01:15:49,877 --> 01:15:51,878
I'm sorry, Jeanie.

1161
01:15:51,879 --> 01:15:55,360
But it's.. it's nothing
to be ashamed of..

1162
01:15:56,618 --> 01:15:59,653
you know, people
having money problems.

1163
01:15:59,654 --> 01:16:02,145
I have to live in
this neighborhood!

1164
01:16:03,424 --> 01:16:05,915
And everybody's gonna know.

1165
01:16:08,596 --> 01:16:12,099
Everybody already knows..

1166
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,591
everything.

1167
01:16:18,606 --> 01:16:22,599
Until recently, you only had
to die once in this city..

1168
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,107
even if you came from God's Pocket.

1169
01:16:28,683 --> 01:16:32,953
There was a time when a 23-year-old
working man could die once,

1170
01:16:32,954 --> 01:16:37,624
have the event noticed
in his local newspaper,

1171
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:39,960
and then move on to his reward

1172
01:16:39,961 --> 01:16:42,796
without the complications
of an additional death.

1173
01:16:42,797 --> 01:16:44,464
Give us this day our daily bread..

1174
01:16:44,465 --> 01:16:47,134
Leon Hubbard's death was
reported incorrectly

1175
01:16:47,135 --> 01:16:50,470
by this newspaper last week.

1176
01:16:50,471 --> 01:16:53,645
But, then, Leon Hubbard
wasn't important.

1177
01:16:55,076 --> 01:16:57,613
Mickey. Oh, motherfucker!

1178
01:17:00,481 --> 01:17:03,750
Leon Hubbard was like the other
working people of God's Pocket..

1179
01:17:03,751 --> 01:17:08,555
dirty-faced, uneducated,
neat as a pin inside.

1180
01:17:08,556 --> 01:17:10,558
Motherfucker!

1181
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:19,232
They Work, marry, and have
children who inhabit the Pocket,

1182
01:17:19,233 --> 01:17:22,714
often in the homes of their
mothers and fathers.

1183
01:17:27,008 --> 01:17:30,344
They drink at The Hollywood
or the Uptown Bar..

1184
01:17:30,345 --> 01:17:32,846
little places deep in the city,

1185
01:17:32,847 --> 01:17:36,183
and they argue there about
things they don't understand..

1186
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:39,995
politics, race, religion.

1187
01:17:41,989 --> 01:17:46,130
And in the end, they die
like everyone else..

1188
01:17:47,628 --> 01:17:50,230
Leaving their families
and their houses

1189
01:17:50,231 --> 01:17:53,257
and their legends.

1190
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:01,132
And there is a dignity in that.

1191
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:06,113
We owe Leon Hubbard an apology

1192
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:09,983
and all the people who knew him
and loved him and worked with him.

1193
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:12,786
If we stop listening to
Leon Hubbard's story

1194
01:18:12,787 --> 01:18:15,555
and all the neighborhood
stories like it,

1195
01:18:15,556 --> 01:18:19,037
eventually the neighborhoods
will stop listening to ours.

1196
01:18:42,583 --> 01:18:44,684
Packed my bags, I'm ready

1197
01:18:44,685 --> 01:18:47,654
Give me a beer.

1198
01:18:47,655 --> 01:18:49,256
To go down to the city

1199
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:50,891
Mr. Shellburn, nothing personal,

1200
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,193
but I think that I better
ask you to leave..

1201
01:18:53,194 --> 01:18:56,196
for your own good.

1202
01:18:56,197 --> 01:18:58,529
Give me a beer.

1203
01:19:01,636 --> 01:19:04,738
What the fuck are you writing
about us in the papers for?

1204
01:19:04,739 --> 01:19:06,540
How is it your business what we do?

1205
01:19:06,541 --> 01:19:08,782
Calling us ignorant, dirty-faced.

1206
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,678
That was a compliment.

1207
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:13,680
You work for a living.
You get dirty.

1208
01:19:13,681 --> 01:19:15,515
That's dirty hands.

1209
01:19:15,516 --> 01:19:17,851
Dirty-faced, you don't take a bath.

1210
01:19:17,852 --> 01:19:19,186
I mean, you ain't from around here,

1211
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,787
and you're making us
look like assholes.

1212
01:19:20,788 --> 01:19:22,055
You don't fucking know us.

1213
01:19:22,056 --> 01:19:24,224
No, I don't.. I didn't
make you assholes.

1214
01:19:24,225 --> 01:19:25,592
I said the opposite.

1215
01:19:25,593 --> 01:19:27,594
If he wasn't busy
fucking Leon's mother,

1216
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:30,263
he might have noticed everybody
in here ain't dirty.

1217
01:19:30,264 --> 01:19:31,498
No offense, Mickey.

1218
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:32,766
All right, maybe we all
ought to calm down.

1219
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:34,968
Fuck calm down. What
is he doing down here?

1220
01:19:34,969 --> 01:19:37,437
I'm down here because
of a misunderstanding.

1221
01:19:37,438 --> 01:19:39,339
- That's why..
- Misunderstanding, my ass.

1222
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,308
This motherfucker came
here to get fucked up.

1223
01:19:41,309 --> 01:19:43,977
This is my city.

1224
01:19:43,978 --> 01:19:45,545
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you.

1225
01:19:45,546 --> 01:19:46,813
But I'm on your side!

1226
01:19:46,814 --> 01:19:48,582
- Take it outside, Danny.
- Wait a minute.

1227
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:50,016
- Let's go.
- Stop!

1228
01:19:50,017 --> 01:19:51,051
- It's his own fault.
- What the fuck?

1229
01:19:51,052 --> 01:19:52,652
Because of something he wrote?

1230
01:19:52,653 --> 01:19:54,087
- Take it outside!
- Come on. Go.

1231
01:19:54,088 --> 01:19:55,388
- Come on.
- Get him out.

1232
01:19:55,389 --> 01:19:56,590
- Let's go.
- Get him out!

1233
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:58,391
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1234
01:19:58,392 --> 01:20:00,667
You ain't from here either!

1235
01:20:03,764 --> 01:20:05,632
Yeah, you piece of shit.

1236
01:20:05,633 --> 01:20:07,334
This ain't your city, motherfucker!

1237
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:09,102
What are you gonna do, huh?

1238
01:20:09,103 --> 01:20:11,838
20 of you against this old man for
something he wrote in the newspaper?

1239
01:20:11,839 --> 01:20:13,340
Ain't none of your business,
Mickey, so stay out of it!

1240
01:20:13,341 --> 01:20:15,242
Shut the fuck up!!
I don't give a fuck!

1241
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,244
Not this!

1242
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:19,338
Get in your car.

1243
01:20:24,185 --> 01:20:25,914
Get him!

1244
01:21:54,041 --> 01:21:56,521
Watch the step.

1245
01:21:57,211 --> 01:21:58,244
Morning, Mick.

1246
01:21:58,245 --> 01:21:59,735
Morning.

1247
01:22:00,581 --> 01:22:02,082
You want some breakfast?

1248
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,218
I can't even think about food
this time of the morning.

1249
01:22:05,219 --> 01:22:07,654
We better go practice, Sophie.

1250
01:22:07,655 --> 01:22:09,122
You want to come along, Mick?

1251
01:22:09,123 --> 01:22:11,124
I'm gonna read the paper.

1252
01:22:11,125 --> 01:22:12,726
You don't mind if we do.

1253
01:22:12,727 --> 01:22:15,002
It's all right. Just be careful.

1254
01:22:15,496 --> 01:22:16,896
Mm..hmm.

1255
01:22:16,897 --> 01:22:18,064
Oh.

1256
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:19,399
Let me get those.

1257
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:20,433
Jesus.

1258
01:22:20,434 --> 01:22:22,168
Would you put something
on those legs?

1259
01:22:22,169 --> 01:22:23,903
Yeah.

1260
01:22:23,904 --> 01:22:25,038
Sweetheart.

1261
01:22:25,039 --> 01:22:26,836
Yeah.

1262
01:22:29,477 --> 01:22:31,811
Ah, Christ.

1263
01:22:31,812 --> 01:22:33,647
We got to keep our guard up, Mick.

1264
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,149
You never fucking know.

1265
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:40,053
Bird, I can't stay forever.

1266
01:22:40,054 --> 01:22:42,656
I got to get a job,
start something.

1267
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:46,026
You'll be here when
they come, Mick.

1268
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,086
You'll know what to do.

1269
01:23:12,486 --> 01:23:14,522
A little bit to your left.

1270
01:23:15,890 --> 01:23:17,926
Okay, that was better.

1271
01:23:21,762 --> 01:23:24,538
Yeah, yeah.. and try not to shake.

1272
01:23:24,700 --> 01:23:33,300
