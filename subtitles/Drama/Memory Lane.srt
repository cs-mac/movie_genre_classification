00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,163
with no windows or sunlight
or anything. (CHUCKLES)

169
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:49,040
(WHISPERS) I mean,
how do we get out of here?

170
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,085
Oh, he didn't tell you?

171
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:54,212
About...

172
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,427
Getting out of here
is the last thing you want to do.

173
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:02,929
Because the air up there,

174
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:04,556
it's contaminated.

175
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:08,059
HOWARD: I see you've met Emmett.

176
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,023
What happened to him?

177
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,983
He did that to himself.

178
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,902
And his stumbling around
isn't helping anything.

179
00:21:17,486 --> 00:21:19,154
What you heard earlier,

180
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:23,200
was him knocking over a shelf
with a whole week's worth of food,

181
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,243
which he's sorry for, correct?

182
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:29,039
Totally.

183
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,837
Let's go. Bathroom time.

184
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,595
(MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING)

185
00:21:48,225 --> 00:21:49,935
HOWARD: This is the common area.

186
00:21:50,227 --> 00:21:51,812
Good for R & R.

187
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:54,564
As you can see,
I've planned for a long stay.

188
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:58,485
The aquaponics system
cleans the air and keeps it fresh.

189
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,906
This is the living room.
Help yourself to any reading.

190
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:07,786
If you like to watch films,
I have some on DVD and VHS cassette.

191
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:11,665
Just make sure you put them back
in their sleeve when they're done.

192
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,626
The kitchen's fully functional.

193
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:19,089
Has an electric stove,
refrigerator, freezer, silverware.

194
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,174
And that table's a family heirloom,

195
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:22,843
which means watch your glasses.

196
00:22:22,926 --> 00:22:26,096
Always use coasters and placemats.

197
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,266
Keep your hands to yourself!

198
00:22:31,601 --> 00:22:32,936
Understand?

199
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:35,188
No touching.

200
00:22:36,189 --> 00:22:37,190
Take a seat.

201
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:44,281
This way.

202
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,389
This is my private space.

203
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:13,143
Off-limits, unless
I give express permission.

204
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:15,186
Go ahead.

205
00:23:17,647 --> 00:23:20,358
- I don't need to.
- You will, though.

206
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,111
And I've got to pace
these things out, so please.

207
00:23:25,697 --> 00:23:27,157
I need privacy.

208
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,242
You're welcome to close the curtain.

209
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,248
I can't with you standing there.

210
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:38,460
And I can't trust you
not to burn this place down.

211
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:40,503
This is for my own safety.

212
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,507
I'm not some pervert! Just go.

We can't afford wasted flushes.

216
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,955

- Those are Megan's.
-(VESSELS CLANG)

without two or three of those things.

Who's Megan?

220

I heard one earlier. Above my room.

227
00:24:51,491 --> 00:24:54,661
If you had heard a car,
the driver would be long dead by now.

228
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:56,955
Well, shouldn't we at least try

229
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,084
to call the police or someone
to find out what actually happened?

230
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,003
There's no one left to call.

231
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:05,255
See that? Nothing's coming through.

00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,437
I mean, it's amazing. You people...

235
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,398
You wear helmets
when you ride your bikes.

236
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,692
You have seat belts in your cars.

237
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:27,944
You have alarm systems
to protect your homes.

238
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,196
But what do you do
when those alarms go off?

It's the air, Michelle.

I took all the quizzes. Sorry.

how to do a French braid, so,

to do that for you, just let me know.

He was in the Navy, I know that.

I guess he did, uh,
some stuff with satellites.

264
00:28:47,352 --> 00:28:49,020
What kind of stuff?

265
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,481
Satellite stuff.

266
00:28:53,274 --> 00:28:54,984

I'm not sure.

that's for sure. (CHUCKLES)

while you're building his bomb shelter.

295
00:30:18,359 --> 00:30:20,236
And now he says that

296
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,156
the air is contaminated
and everybody's dead.

297
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:27,869
Yeah, I know what you're getting at,
but there's more to it.

298
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:29,329
Howard abducted me.

299
00:30:30,663 --> 00:30:34,167
He drove me off the road
and he dragged me here.

00:30:35,501 --> 00:30:39,630
So, whatever he's telling you
about the air, some big attack,

301
00:30:39,714 --> 00:30:42,342
the purpose of this shelter, is a lie.

No. No way.

303
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,263

304
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:48,806
What do you mean?

305
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:52,018
I was on my way home from work.

306
00:30:53,644 --> 00:30:55,688
And it looked like a flash.

307
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,899
Bright red.

308
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,194
Like an explosion, from way far off.

309
00:31:02,945 --> 00:31:04,697
It wasn't like fireworks.

310
00:31:06,449 --> 00:31:09,619
Naw, this was more like
something you'd read about in the Bible.

311
00:31:12,663 --> 00:31:16,000
So, what, you saw, what,
a flash of light? Lightning?

312
00:31:17,835 --> 00:31:19,379
A fire that flared up?

313
00:31:19,462 --> 00:31:20,630
I'm not explaining it right.

314
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:22,965
This wasn't like anything I'd ever seen.

315
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,135
And so, my first thought
was to come here.

316
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:29,430
And when I got here,
Howard was closing the door.

317
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,808
And I could see it, right there on his face,

318
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:33,476
he knew something was happening.

319
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,770
Something bad.

320
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:40,149
And so, I fought my way in.

321
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,116
I heard a car.

322
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,412
Right here. Above us.

323
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:57,667
You heard someone?

324
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,252
Right above us.

325
00:32:03,881 --> 00:32:05,383
That isn't possible.

326
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:09,137
- The air is...
- What, contaminated?

327
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:12,974
- How do you know that?
- Because I told him.

328
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,769
Dinner's ready.

329
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:34,245
I see you two are getting along.

330
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:56,559
Hmm.

331
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:08,905
How's that sauce?

332
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:10,865
It's fine.

333
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:13,201
As cooks go, I'm okay.

334
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,162
Not great, but okay.

335
00:33:16,954 --> 00:33:18,789
Megan was a good cook.

336
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,251
You'll learn to love cooking.

337
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:30,176
Mmm...

338
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,178
<i>EMMETT '. Mmm.</i>

339
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,597
It's delicious.

340
00:33:35,598 --> 00:33:37,600
That's the best sauce I've ever tasted.

341
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,685
Are you being funny?

342
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:41,145
No, I mean,

343
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:44,607
considering the alternative,
which is, you know,

344
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48,444
getting burnt up in a chemical attack,
or nuclear,

345
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:51,864
I'd say being alive and down here would

346
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:54,283
make a fried turd taste pretty good, so...

347
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,745
Best damn sauce I ever had.

348
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:02,583
That's not a bad point.

349
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,669
And, please,
watch your language at table.

350
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:08,089
Right?

351
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,554
You know what I haven't been able to
get out of my head, for some reason?

352
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,472
Ever since I got down here.

353
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:19,475
Tattoos.

354
00:34:20,226 --> 00:34:21,894
Always wanted one.

355
00:34:22,687 --> 00:34:24,647
But I never got any.
'Cause everybody always said,

356
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,899
"No, no, Emmett, you'll never get
a decent job if you do that."

357
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,693
Whatever.

358
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,444
Like that matters now, right?

359
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:33,656
Tell you what,
if I had known this was coming,

360
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,159
I would've gotten, like,
50 of them. I swear, man.

361
00:34:37,493 --> 00:34:39,662
I would look like a circus freak,
or something.

362
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,247
I'd just be covered head to toe.

363
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:43,583
Tattoos all over my...
You know, everywhere. Face?

364
00:34:43,666 --> 00:34:46,586
Sure. Right there. Across my forehead.

365
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:49,672
Just my name. "Emmett."

366
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,924
Or, you know,

367
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,468
-"Thug Life."
-(CHUCKLES)

368
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:55,845
llYoLo-ll

369
00:34:55,928 --> 00:34:57,096
I don't even know what that means,

370
00:34:57,179 --> 00:34:58,681
but, you know,
I hear people saying it all the time,

371
00:34:58,764 --> 00:34:59,974
so, it must be cool. (CHUCKLES)

372
00:35:04,562 --> 00:35:05,855
Hey, what about you, Howard?

373
00:35:09,525 --> 00:35:11,360
Anything you wish you'd done?

374
00:35:15,156 --> 00:35:16,907
In all honesty, no.

375
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:19,285
No?

376
00:35:20,745 --> 00:35:22,997
No crazy nights in Vegas?

377
00:35:24,957 --> 00:35:27,460
Maybe, uh, take a pilgrimage to Waco?

378
00:35:29,879 --> 00:35:32,089
Everything I wanted to do, I did.

379
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:34,759
I focused on being prepared.

380
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:36,427
And I was.

381
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:39,513
And here we are.

382
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:52,943
EMMETT: Oh, my goodness.

383
00:35:53,027 --> 00:35:54,487
<i>Is that Monopoly?</i>

384
00:35:56,072 --> 00:35:57,573
There we go!

385
00:35:57,657 --> 00:35:59,533
Yeah, that's how we kill the time.

386
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,494
What would you say, Howard,
we're gonna be down here,

387
00:36:01,577 --> 00:36:03,913
what, like, a year? Two? Maybe?

388
00:36:04,997 --> 00:36:06,666
I bet you if we started a game right now,

389
00:36:06,749 --> 00:36:08,459
we might even
get halfway finished by the time...

390
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,752
Stop talking!

391
00:36:10,544 --> 00:36:11,962
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

392
00:36:18,094 --> 00:36:21,389
You don't need to make jokes about
how long we're going to be down here

393
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:23,974
when nobody knows
how long that's going to be.

394
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,686
Your humor is not funny.

395
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:28,688
I don't appreciate it
while I'm trying to eat,

396
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:29,814
and neither does Michelle.

397
00:36:30,106 --> 00:36:33,275
Now, please shut up
and let us eat in peace.

398
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,177
Hmm.

399
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:02,638
Emmett?

400
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,142
Would you pass me a napkin?

401
00:37:14,191 --> 00:37:15,484
Thank you.

402
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:19,071
I know what you're saying.
I never could finish Monopoly.

403
00:37:19,822 --> 00:37:22,283
That game really
does take forever, right?

404
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,161
For me, though, it was, um...

405
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,371
<i>Chutes and Ladders,</i>

406
00:37:27,872 --> 00:37:29,039
uh...

407
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:31,250
<i>Sorry!'</i>

408
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:33,085
<i>and Trouble.</i>

409
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,755
You know, the thing with the dice
and the thing that you pressed,

410
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:37,548
-what was that called?
- The...

411
00:37:37,631 --> 00:37:40,259
BOTH: Pop-O-Matic bubble! Yeah.

412
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:42,928
Did you ever play that, um...
What was that, Operation?

413
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,263
- Loved Operation!
- I'm telling you, man,

414
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,431
I couldn't play that game.

415
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:46,682
- It terrified me.
- Why...

416
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:50,269
That noise that thing would make
when you hit that edge. I mean...

417
00:37:50,352 --> 00:37:52,605
- Good Lord!
-(CHUCKLING) it was pretty scary.

418
00:37:53,606 --> 00:37:54,690
Could you hand me the salt?

419
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,612
Please?

420
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,076
Ah, shoot! I'm sorry.

421
00:38:07,495 --> 00:38:09,205
I'm gonna need the pepper also.

422
00:38:16,879 --> 00:38:18,631
What exactly do you think you're doing?

423
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:19,757
I'm asking for pepper.

424
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,258
Like hell you were! What was that?

425
00:38:21,342 --> 00:38:22,718
I don't know what you're
talking about, Howard.

426
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:25,137
Are you trying to insult me?

427
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:29,141
Here, in the shelter that I built
that's keeping you alive?

428
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:32,061
You don't think I see what you just did?

429
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:35,481
Is that how you thank me
for saving your life?

430
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:36,649
- Howard, calm down.
- Shut up!

431
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,360
Shut up and stay in your seat!

432
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,201
IS it?

433
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,411
Now, let me tell you,

434
00:38:50,037 --> 00:38:52,373
I know what a traitor looks like.

435
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,791
Understand?

436
00:38:55,751 --> 00:39:00,256
I have shown you nothing,
but generosity and hospitality.

437
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:04,760
I want you to apologize.

438
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,973
To tell me you're going to behave.

439
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:13,269
I will.

440
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:18,274
You will what?

441
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,487
Hlbehave.

442
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,783
And I'm so sorry.

443
00:39:32,621 --> 00:39:33,622

That's easy to forget down here.

it only touched me a little. A little!

00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:16,689
What are you doing?

657
00:55:21,069 --> 00:55:22,695
Ooh!

658
00:55:22,779 --> 00:55:25,323
Cornering the market on
post-apocalyptic fashion, huh?

659
00:55:25,406 --> 00:55:26,407
Mmm-hmm.

660
00:55:26,533 --> 00:55:28,785
You need more axes and chain saws.

661
00:55:28,868 --> 00:55:30,745
For what? She has a shotgun.

662
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:32,914
Yeah. But what if up there it's like...

663
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:35,834
What? Lumberjacks?

664
00:55:35,917 --> 00:55:36,960
Zombies.

665
00:55:38,419 --> 00:55:40,922
Though even Howard doesn't think
that one's plausible.

666
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:44,551
But you should hear his theory
about mutant space worms.

667
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,052
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

668
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:47,679
(RUMBLING)

669
00:55:49,848 --> 00:55:51,266
What is that? Howard!

670
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,434
Stay calm. We're okay.

671
00:55:54,936 --> 00:55:56,771
(RUMBLING AND CLANGING)

672
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:01,776
- What was that?
- Quiet.

673
00:56:05,613 --> 00:56:07,615
That sounds like helicopters.

674
00:56:08,283 --> 00:56:09,576
HOWARD: Could be military.

675
00:56:10,243 --> 00:56:11,661
But not ours.

676
00:56:12,245 --> 00:56:15,039
- EMMETT: How can you tell?
- Fourteen years in the Navy.

677
00:56:15,123 --> 00:56:17,000
What's happening up there?

678
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,293
My guess?

679
00:56:19,419 --> 00:56:22,422
Those flashes that kicked this all off?

680
00:56:22,797 --> 00:56:24,465
That was phase one.

681
00:56:25,133 --> 00:56:27,802
Take out your opponent's
population centers

682
00:56:27,886 --> 00:56:30,680
with big hits, all at once, fast.

683
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,974
And then for round two,

684
00:56:33,474 --> 00:56:35,101
ground sweeps.

685
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:38,855
A satellite log showed an increase
in coded traffic recently.

686
00:56:39,188 --> 00:56:41,399
Possibly extraterrestrial signals.

687
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,236
I bet what we just heard
were airborne patrols

688
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:48,239
sent to hunt down
the remaining signs of life.

689
00:56:49,282 --> 00:56:50,617
Like us.

690
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:54,329
-(SOFT WHIRRING)
-(ALARM BUZZING)

691
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,541
Okay. Oh, boy.

692
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,460
That's bad.

693
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:05,757
(GRUNTS)

694
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,508
And that's worse.

695
00:57:08,718 --> 00:57:10,219
What's up there?

696
00:57:10,845 --> 00:57:12,889
Air filtration system.

697
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:15,058
I can't... (GRUNTS)

698
00:57:15,683 --> 00:57:17,685
Something blocking the hatch.

699
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:23,900
If we can't get it back on, we're gonna
run out of breathable air fast.

700
00:57:30,740 --> 00:57:31,783
(HOWARD GRUNTS)

701
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:34,077
You're the only one
small enough to reach it.

702
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:35,787
Reach what?

703
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,665
The filtration system.
Through there, the main duct.

704
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:41,626
Someone needs to get in there
and restart it.

705
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,464
Give me a hand.

706
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:49,384
Let me go. She's not gonna
know her way around the unit.

707
00:57:49,467 --> 00:57:51,803
You won't fit. Plus your arm.
She'll be fine.

708
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:56,641
Now, to restart the unit,
you just swing the handle off,

709
00:57:56,724 --> 00:57:59,060
then on, off, then on.

710
00:58:00,186 --> 00:58:01,688
That should do it.

711
00:58:04,399 --> 00:58:07,902
And neither of us will be able to go in
and help you if you get stuck.

712
00:58:11,614 --> 00:58:12,949
Don't get stuck.

713
00:58:27,463 --> 00:58:28,756
(GRUNTING SOFTLY)

714
00:58:54,282 --> 00:58:55,658
HOWARD: Michelle!

715
00:58:56,117 --> 00:58:57,326
Everything okay up there?
