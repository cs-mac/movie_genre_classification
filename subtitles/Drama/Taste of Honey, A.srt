Even when my father passed away...

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,290
I couldn't do anything for him.

5
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:21,270
Jin Ho...

6
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,600
No matter how much I run,

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm still in that same spot.

8
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,020
Jin Ho, are you crying?

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,720
Jin Ho, don't cry.

00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,170
What happened?

12
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,420
What did we do?

13
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,040
What was it again?

14
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,440
Does that mean he's interested in women now?

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,440
Then me? In me?

16
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,540
What about me?

17
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,490
You're going to work?

00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:15,830
<i>Last night...</i>

19
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,000
It seems I was rather drunk.

20
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,040
If I did anything I shouldn't have...

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,840
Do you not... remember anything?

22
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:32,909
So you don't remember anything about
owing me money either?

23
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:34,980
I gave you five 10,000 won bills,

24
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,570
that's 50,000.

25
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:44,389
No... no, that's alright.

26
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,050
I was joking.

27
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,709
What kind of man are you,

28
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,189
to still behave so properly when drunk.

29
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,189
You were no fun at all.

30
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,520
If I did something wrong...

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,020
Please forgive me.

32
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,620
I drank too much last night.

33
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,250
Between friends, why concern yourself
so much about this.

34
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,290
It's alright, go to work.

35
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,020
Right.

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,880
He must have mistaken me for his lover.

37
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,480
No matter how drunk he got...

38
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,340
How can he do this to just anyone?

39

<i>Park Gae In, are you an idiot?</i>

<i>A fool?</i>

41
00:03:57,561 --> 00:04:01,610
Why... Why does everyone treat me like this?

42
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,880
<i>What did I do so wrong?</i>

43
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,660
<i>Everyone...</i>

44
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,030
<i>Why is everyone making me so miserable?</i>

45
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,420

Teacher Park's daughter,

54

Yes.

58
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,570
No need for packing materials,

59
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:01,570
just the car will do.

60
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,550
Yes, then please come on Saturday.

61
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,650
You're moving out of Sanggojae?

62
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:07,300
Yes.

63
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,910
There's no reason for me to stay longer.

64
00:05:08,911 --> 00:05:10,550
Yes, you did well.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,220
If you keep staying there,
it will only upset you.

66
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,200
Right, take a break for now,

67
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,070
and let's begin anew.

68
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,460
I'll make a few calls to see what we can do.

69
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,060
There's plenty of people who want
to work with us.

70
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,400
By the way...

71
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:33,430
I was wondering if we should try this...

72
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,110
You know my mother,

73
00:05:35,111 --> 00:05:39,010
she has a distant relative working
in the canteen of the presidential palace.

74
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,950
If we talked to that person,

75
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,700
and proposed a remodeling project of the
presidential palace, what do you think?

76
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,930
You don't find it funny?

77
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,470
Should I have laughed?

78
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:59,030
You... you really...

79
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,290
You really have no sense of humor.

80
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,590
<i>Take this and go.</i>

81
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,530
What's this?

82
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,450
We're at work here.

83
00:06:18,451 --> 00:06:21,550
To use polite speech at work,
don't you even know that much?

84
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,770
It's an advance for the recreation
room design.

85
00:06:25,771 --> 00:06:27,760
The rest is being prepared and
will be transferred to you,

86
00:06:27,761 --> 00:06:29,760

<i>Yes, Jin Ho.</i>

Are you alright?

89
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,260
You left just like that last night,

90
00:06:43,261 --> 00:06:45,260
I was worried, so I'm calling.

91
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,270
<i>I wanted to buy you a drink.</i>

92
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,910
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,750
Today is kind of...

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,410
<i>Don't be like that,</i>

95
00:06:53,411 --> 00:06:54,880
<i>it won't take a lot of time.</i>

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,370
I have a prior appointment.

97
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:59,520
<i>I guess there's nothing to be done then.</i>

98
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,820
In any case,

99
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,560
keep up the good work, Jin Ho.

100
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,560
That...

101
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,606
What was that about?

102
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,330
What do you mean Jin Ho abruptly
left yesterday?

103
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,560
Didn't you know?

104
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:16,134
I thought you were roommates?

105
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,260
Yesterday, the Dam Art Gallery project
announced

106
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:21,260
the qualifying entry criteria.

107
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,210
All that Jin Ho had been preparing
to this point,

108
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,958
has been for naught.

<i>Jin Ho, are you crying?</i>

112

<i>You're always like this.</i>

113
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,170
Pretending to be nice and caring,

114
00:07:47,171 --> 00:07:49,330
but in the end, you only see what
you want to see.

115
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,490
Oh well,

116
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,060
I guess Jin Ho had no reason
to tell you about such things.

Well, about that,

when I put the fish in the water,
they still resembled a fish,

but slowly they started disappearing,
these guys.

Look at the way you stirred it,

149
00:10:51,011 --> 00:10:52,350
you must have stirred the fish away.

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,600
Please don't fall as you run,

168
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,030
always carry painkillers with you,

169
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,362
don't cut your hand while cooking.

170
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:34,030
You can take over cutting the ingredients.

171
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:37,010
If I fall, you can help me up.

172
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,340
If I'm out of medication,

173
00:11:38,341 --> 00:11:39,730
you can help me buy it too,

174
00:11:39,731 --> 00:11:41,540
what have I got to worry about?

175
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,740
Until when will I be living here?

176
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,540
What's wrong, Jin Ho?

177
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,880
Suddenly...

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,390
It sounds like you're about to
move out soon.

179
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,700
I was never going to stay here forever.

180
00:11:56,701 --> 00:11:57,780
That's right.

181
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,260
That's true, but...

182
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,400
Even so...

183
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:04,440
to hear you suddenly say such things...

184
00:12:04,441 --> 00:12:06,610
it feels weird.

185
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,360
I'm not moving out immediately,

186
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,630
so just eat up.

187
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,600
When I think about you leaving,

188
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:20,040
I lose my appetite.

189
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,489
You should change that too.

190
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,670
Forming overly deep attachments to people,

191
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,521
clinging onto them.

192
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:30,217
I'm that kind of person.

193
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:35,017
I guess I'm starved of affection.

194
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,758
Are you working?

195
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,619
Can't you tell?

196
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,029
I'm going to take out the trash...

197
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,340
So?

198
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,750
It's a little heavy,

199
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:06,670
can't you come with me?

200
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,747
You call that heavy?

201
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,318
I mean, we could go out, take a walk,
relax a little, it'll be nice!

202
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,360
I relax by working.

203
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,650
It's not like you have anything
to work on now...

204
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,230
What did you say?

205
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:25,900
No, nothing.

206
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you have time tomorrow?

207
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,942
Tomorrow, why?

208
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,540
Let's take a last test tomorrow.

209
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,954
A last test?

210
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:42,940
Whether the training has been
of any use,

211
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,640
I want to do an overall assessment.

212
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:45,510
How?

213
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,350
I'll pretend to be your boyfriend,

214
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,230
you should treat it as a date with a man,

215
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,770
and make use of what you've learned so far.

216
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,290
So you're saying we'll go on a date?

217
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,950
It's not a date.

218
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,020
It's the last test.

219
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:01,360
But then, don't you have to go to work?

220
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,190
I have the day off.

221
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:05,550
Then tomorrow, I'll turn into
a flawless beauty,

222
00:14:05,551 --> 00:14:07,240
and give you a shock.

223
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,020
Look forward to it.

224
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,180
Chang Ryul.

225
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,180
Gae In.

226
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,720
Chang Ryul, what are you doing here?

227
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:33,820
It's nothing, I'm off.

228
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:35,440
I'm leaving now.

229
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,730
Why do you keep coming here?

230
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,420
I just end up coming back.

231
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,040
Even though I know I can't
look you up anymore,

232
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,870
I feel so helpless and suffering,

233
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,430
I came towards you without realizing it.

234
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:04,410
<i>I also want to have someone
I can share everything with,</i>

235
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,150
<i>but no one wants to listen to me, Gae In.</i>

236
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,250
But you've always...

237
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,630
listened to me seriously.

238
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,350
Chang Ryul,

239
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:24,210
if you hadn't betrayed me,

240
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:26,930
I probably would have

241
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,690
always been a listening ear.

242
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,120
Gae In...

243
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,790
Gae In...

244
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,040
Actually...

245
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,070
My mother...

246
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,390
My mother, she...

247
00:15:45,391 --> 00:15:46,710
Your mother?

248
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:49,020
What mother?

249
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,920
Why?

250
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:57,470
Did she pass away?

251
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,290
<i>After divorcing my father,</i>

252
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,480
<i>the man she remarried</i>

253
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,470
<i>worked for some kind of international
cooperative agency.</i>

254
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,760
If my mother leave for Africa this time,

255
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,130
I might never see her again.

256
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,490
Africa.

257
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,590
That's pretty far away.

258
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,270
Because of my father, she couldn't
attend my wedding,

259
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:31,490
she said she wanted to meet
her son and daughter-in-law.

260
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,970
She said it might be her last chance.

261
00:16:35,971 --> 00:16:37,670
But these words,

262
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,350
shouldn't you be telling them to In Hee?

263
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,410
We're completely over, the two of us.

264
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:49,950
<i>In Hee said,</i>

265
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,000
<i>she fell for the me in your imaginations.</i>

266
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,670
You made me out into

267
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:59,670
the most perfect person in the world,

268
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,720
giving her misconceptions.

269
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,640
<i>A person like me,</i>

270
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,990
only to Park Gae In would he be

271
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,470
the most perfect person in the world.

272
00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:24,740
Park Gae In.

273
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm coming in.

274
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,040
Did she go on that walk alone?

275
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,040
That's right.

276
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,150
It's ridiculous, I know it too.

277
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,910
I'm crazy, aren't I?

278
00:17:44,911 --> 00:17:47,050
To ask this of you,

279
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,010
isn't something a rational person would do.

280
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,010
<i>Sorry, Gae In, I'm sorry.</i>

281
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,660
<i>Just treat me as a rabid dog.</i>

282
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,260
Chang Ryul, you crazy person.

283
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:02,330
<i>But my stepmother,</i>

284
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:06,010
whenever I get beaten with
a golf club by my father,

285
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,510
she rushes over to block him.

286
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:11,060
Her hands were always covered with bruises.

287
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,500
Gae In, I...

288
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:17,000
I know this is completely insane...

289
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,040
But right now,

290
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:23,190
there's no one I can depend on but you.

291
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,410
You're really something.

292
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,640
How could you ask such a thing of me?

293
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,780
<i>Actually...</i>

294
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,650
My step mother

295
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:40,250
is the real mother who gave birth to me.

296
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,730
<i>Your birth mother?</i>

297
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,380
<i>I thought she had passed away?</i>

298
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,620
<i>My father...</i>

299
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,010
<i>had me illegitimately through an affair.</i>

300
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,010
<i>So I was registered under my mother
who passed away.</i>

301
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
It sounds incredible but...

302
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,650
This last request from my mother...

303
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
I really hope to fulfill it.

304
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,980
Hey, Jin Ho.

305
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,030
Our date...

306
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:38,030
Can we do it some other time?

307
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,890
<i>My friend just called me,</i>

308
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,590
<i>said she had just given birth.</i>

309
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:45,530
But this friend's mother is far away,

310
00:19:45,531 --> 00:19:46,590
and she has no relatives either.

311
00:19:46,591 --> 00:19:47,820
In that situation,

312
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:49,190
I really should go and take care of her,

313
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:50,940
such is the case.

314
00:19:51,091 --> 00:19:53,520
Aren't Young Sun and In Hee
your only friends?

315
00:19:53,521 --> 00:19:55,780
Well, really, Jin Ho...

316
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,930
My social circle isn't so narrow!

317
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,030
Wait...

318
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:02,420
Could it be,

319
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:03,840
because our date is cancelled,

320
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:05,020
you're not happy?

321
00:20:05,021 --> 00:20:06,710
Why should I be?

322
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:10,750
I got to avoid an unpleasant task,
this turned out well.

323
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,750
The way you put things...

324
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,540
It was you who asked me out
on a date first!

325
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,780
It was you who bothered me left and right
about making you into a woman.

326
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,430
In this case, let's just end it all.

327
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:22,080
That was what I meant.

328
00:20:22,081 --> 00:20:25,500
Jin Ho, do you always have
to speak so coldly?

329
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,850
<i>I know.</i>

330
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:41,040
<i>You're frustrated because of work.</i>

331
00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:43,710
You...

332
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,430
Don't you know how to get mad?

333
00:20:46,431 --> 00:20:48,430
Just get angry!

334
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,430
Fool.

335
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,450
Can't you be more truthful towards a friend?

336
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,020
Is this all you're good for?

337
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,350
Jin Ho!

338
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:07,850
Where are you going?

339
00:21:07,851 --> 00:21:09,510
Why do you want to know?

340
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:10,760
Sorry...

341
00:21:11,790 --> 00:21:13,670
<i>I was the one who broke off the date,</i>

342
00:21:13,671 --> 00:21:15,670
but I got mad first instead.

343
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,930
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,430
But as for that last test...

345
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:25,000
You'll still let me do it, right?

346
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,320
Where are you going?

347
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,210
Won't you take me with you?

348
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,460
Stop fooling around, keep your head
in the car!

349
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:52,460
Jin Ho!

350
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:55,030
I bet you've never shouted out loud
like that even once.

351
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,360
Even when you get mad, you just keep it in.

352
00:21:58,550 --> 00:21:59,850
When you're sad, you keep it in too.

353
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,480
Do you think I'm like Candy*.

354
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:01,480
<i>{\a6}(*from manga Candy Candy)</i>

355
00:22:01,481 --> 00:22:02,780
That's what I'm saying.

356
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,990
Since you're not Candy,

357
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,560
why do you keep your sadness and
loneliness inside?

358
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,270
I'm neither lonely nor sad.

359
00:22:08,271 --> 00:22:10,270
Bottling it up will make you sick.

360
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,030
Here.

361
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,860
Now even if you were to shout
I won't hear a word,

362
00:22:14,861 --> 00:22:16,620
so just let it all out, yeah?

363
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:19,000
Like that.

364
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,490
Come on!

365
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,240
Louder!

366
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,720
Stop fooling with me,

367
00:22:30,721 --> 00:22:32,500
you're all gonna die!

368
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:33,150
Like that.

369
00:22:33,151 --> 00:22:34,500
You go ahead and do it.

370
00:22:34,501 --> 00:22:36,160
I'm telling you to give it a try!

371
00:22:36,161 --> 00:22:38,970
It will really make you feel good inside.

372
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:40,990
That's my wish,

373
00:22:40,991 --> 00:22:42,000
I'm telling you to give it a try!

374
00:22:42,001 --> 00:22:43,020
Don't do that!

375
00:22:43,021 --> 00:22:43,910
You'll cause an accident.

376
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,460
You're using friendly speech!

377
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,490
Jin Ho!

378
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,320
<i>Let's drop the formalities from now on.</i>

379
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:52,450
If I drop the formalities with you,
who knows what you'll ask of me in future.

380
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,430
Okay, in that case, we'll go for
that one in future.

381
00:22:55,431 --> 00:22:57,430
For now, just give shouting a try.

382
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,040
It's my wish!

383
00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:00,822
Just once, do it just once!

384
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,980
Louder!

385
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,050
Jin Ho, are you a man?

386
00:23:13,051 --> 00:23:14,440
Even a woman can do better!

387
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,270
Like that!

388
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,730
Yah! You're all dead!

389
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,960
All right!

390
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:25,630
Yah! You guys are all dead!

391
00:23:25,631 --> 00:23:27,030
Louder! Be a man!

392
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,000
Here.

393
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:43,050
So, after having given it a good shout,

394
00:23:43,051 --> 00:23:44,570
don't you feel better?

395
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,320
A friend like me,

396
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:48,030
it's good to have one, isn't it?

397
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,650
Since we're already out,

398
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,910
shall we do the last test?

399
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,310
I'm not in the mood.

400
00:23:59,290 --> 00:24:00,880
Precisely, since you're not in the mood,

401
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,490
so we should loosen it up!

402
00:24:02,491 --> 00:24:04,200
Aren't you curious about my results?

403
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:06,030
I'm confident about doing well.

404
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:15,370
Park Gae In.

405
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:16,910
Yes?

406
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,020
Don't fall for me.

407
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,300
Because I won't love you.

408
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,690
Yes...

409
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,250
That's...

410
00:24:27,251 --> 00:24:29,030
That's... evident, isn't it?

411
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,040
Is this the test, right here?

412
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,070
I'll have to get into it.

413
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:43,060
Please continue.

414
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:45,060
So here we are,

415
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,250
established lovers of many years.

416
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:50,500
I'm going out with you

417
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,000
because you look like a girl
I used to date.

418
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,550
<i>I can't forget this girl.</i>

419
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,170
No matter how hard I try,

420
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,030
I can't erase my memories of her.

421
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,360
Perhaps in the future,

422
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:12,780
I might call you by her name,

423
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,040
<i>ask you to behave as she used to...</i>

424
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,520
Would you be alright with that?

425
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,690
That woman...

426
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,340
You must have loved her a lot.

427
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,530
Yes.

428
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,780
I'll do it.

429
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,520
Because I love you a lot,

430
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,220
the requests of the one I love,
I'll try my best to fulfill.

431
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,570
Hey, Park Gae In!

432
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,000
Is this what I taught you?

433
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,900
<i>How have you changed?</i>

434
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:00,060
You're as much of a fool as before,
what's different about it?

435
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,640
No, I...

436
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,640
I couldn't help it...

437
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,310
The words came out on their own...

438
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,410
because you begged me so sincerely...

439
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:13,270
How long do you plan to live
to please others?

440
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,870
Then...

441
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,690
What should I have done?

442
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,330
To love...

443
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,650
is to throw your pride away.

444
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:44,510
Love does not ask you to discard
your pride.

445
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,970
It's about protecting a person.

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,480
<i>Don't do this in future.</i>

447
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:53,720
Don't believe people so easily.

448
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,420
Don't fall in love so easily.

449
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,740
Don't forgive easily either.

450
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,560
Please...

451
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,730
Become stronger.

452
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,920
I'll do that.

453
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:21,370
I'll try harder.

454
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:25,580
<i>Then you shouldn't have accepted
that jerk Chang Ryul's request.</i>

455
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:29,140
<i>You'll never change.</i>

456
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,720
This all I have to teach you.

457
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,000
Why?

458
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:41,030
Don't you believe me?

459
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,800
I'll work hard!

460
00:27:46,801 --> 00:27:48,370
I can change!

461
00:27:48,371 --> 00:27:51,020
Jin Ho, if you can't believe in me,
who will?

462
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,790
Go on in.

463
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,090
What about you, Jin Ho?

464
00:28:07,091 --> 00:28:09,010
There's somewhere I have to go.

465
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,320
Will you be late?

466
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:12,602
I'm not sure.

467
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,030
<i>{\a6}Although my eyes keep searching
for that person</i>

468
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:30,530
<i>{\a6}Although my heart keeps constricting
in pain</i>

469
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:36,010
<i>{\a6}I believed that it wasn't love</i>

470
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:39,280
<i>{\a6}I'm just a little lonely</i>

471
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:43,580
<i>{\a6}Is what I believed it was</i>

472
00:28:43,885 --> 00:28:50,151
<i>{\a6}Like a fool, why didn't I figure it out?</i>

473
00:28:50,153 --> 00:28:56,972
<i>{\a6}Like a fool, why did I let you go?</i>

474
00:28:56,973 --> 00:29:04,210
<i>{\a6}Like a fool, my heart that's overflowing
with tears</i>

475
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:09,920
<i>{\a6}Finally, it has finally come to know</i>

476
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:15,960
<i>{\a6}That my love belongs to that person alone</i>

477
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,410
<i>Please...</i>

478
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,600
<i>Be stronger.</i>

479
00:29:22,601 --> 00:29:27,430
<i>{\a6}That person is</i>

480
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,686
<i>{\a6}The only one I love</i>

481
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:37,465
<i>{\a6}That person is the only one who lulls
my heart to sleep</i>

482
00:29:37,466 --> 00:29:40,852
<i>{\a6}Like a fool</i>

483
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,020
<i>{\a6}I've finally figured it out</i>

484
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,440
<i>{\a6}That it keeps calling for that person</i>

485
00:29:52,580 --> 00:30:00,400
<i>{\a6}Because I can't live without that person in my life</i>

486
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,120
Was this...

487
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:08,080
Did you...

488
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:10,630
Don't forget...

489
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:12,336
that roses have thorns.

490
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,700
When you come to understand this,

491
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,010
I'll consider that you've passed.

492
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,440
Hey, that...

493
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:34,810
I've looked at the Jin Sun high school
sports centre project,

494
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,020
the conditions are better than expected.

495
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:38,880
I see.

496
00:30:38,881 --> 00:30:40,270
And also...

497
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,290
Yes, Kim In Hee?

498
00:30:46,291 --> 00:30:49,010
Manager seems to have gone to the villa.

499
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:50,640
I'll send you details of the address,

500
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,110
so you can look him up.

501
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:54,880
When Director Choi went to
the chairman's office,

502
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:57,040
they got into a quarrel.

503
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,470
I heard this from the secretary's office.

504
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,780
So I think there's still a chance.

505
00:31:01,781 --> 00:31:02,769
Please don't give up.

506
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:05,440
In any case,

507
00:31:05,441 --> 00:31:06,960
thank you very much.

508
00:31:06,961 --> 00:31:08,760
<i>Good luck, Jin Ho!</i>

509
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,040
I thought the Dam Art Gallery project
was finished for us.

510
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:15,160
Why does Kim In Hee still call?

511
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,440
Unni, what's up so early in the morning?

512
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:34,120
Unni?

513
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,030
This is good.

514
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,410
That's right, from today,
my gay disguise will be revealed.

515
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,700
Young Sun, I'm a perfect man.

516
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:49,520
Get it?

517
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,210
You're doing fine?

518
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,490
Ah, that's right!

519
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,140
I noticed the last time that
your skin wasn't very good,

520
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,170
so I got you some vitamins and cosmetics.

521
00:31:59,171 --> 00:32:00,810
Just drink this with water.

522
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,350
Once your skin is ruined,

523
00:32:02,351 --> 00:32:04,350
it's hard for it to regain its former state!

524
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:07,950
Thank you, Unni.

525
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,020
But, Unni...

526
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:15,030
I have something to confess.

527
00:32:15,031 --> 00:32:16,280
What is it? Tell me, tell me.

528
00:32:16,690 --> 00:32:18,470
Actually, I...

529
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,040
am a perfect man.

530
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:23,280
Really?

531
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,770
Of course not...

532
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,310
Well, you don't look like one,

533
00:32:28,311 --> 00:32:29,560
<i>Seriously...</i>

534
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,970
Actually...

535
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,010
I also have something to confess.

536
00:32:36,011 --> 00:32:37,140
What, what, what?

537
00:32:37,141 --> 00:32:40,080
I haven't even told Gae In because
I'm so embarrassed,

538
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,890
<i>I...</i>

539
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,450
What do you think of me, as a woman?

540
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,450
What?

541
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,880
Whether I see you as a woman?

542
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:52,830
No!

543
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:57,550
I just think that someone like you
might be able to tell me objectively.

544
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,250
As a woman, my charms,
are they lacking?

545
00:33:01,251 --> 00:33:03,060
Unni, what are you saying?

546
00:33:03,061 --> 00:33:04,550
Unni, you're awesome!

547
00:33:04,551 --> 00:33:05,850
Unni, you're really very good!

548
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,930
Isn't it?

549
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,910
You're the best!

550
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,340
I really... receive facial treatments often,

551
00:33:11,341 --> 00:33:13,190
and go to the gym regularly!

552
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,090
Unni, your body is perfect!

553
00:33:15,091 --> 00:33:17,450
Unni, you're... perfect!

554
00:33:17,451 --> 00:33:18,410
Isn't that right?!

555
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,490
But then, why are you asking me that?

556
00:33:21,491 --> 00:33:23,490
It's just... nothing.

557
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:25,480
So as a woman, I'm... good?

558
00:33:25,481 --> 00:33:26,450
Very good!

559
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,840
Really?

560
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,320
Meeting you has really been

561
00:33:30,321 --> 00:33:31,880
a real blessing to me!

562
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:33,930
I need to use the restroom.

563
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:36,100
Unni, don't forget this.

564
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,439
You're so thoughtful.

565
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,860
What do I do now?

566
00:33:40,861 --> 00:33:42,910
I'm getting addicted to acting gay.

567
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,820
Waiter!

568
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,240
Did you just get off work?

569
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,500
What are you rushing about for?

570
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,370
I told you the last time,

571
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,360
my friend...

572
00:34:01,361 --> 00:34:02,420
has just given birth.

573
00:34:02,421 --> 00:34:05,040
<i>Now I have to rush to see her now.</i>

574
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,510
Then shouldn't you have gone and
come back earlier?

575
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,510
Of course I have!

576
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:12,190
I've been there and back,

577
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:14,230
<i>but the baby threw up in my hair.</i>

578
00:34:14,231 --> 00:34:15,560
So I came back to watch my hair,

579
00:34:15,561 --> 00:34:17,170
and I'm returning there now.

580
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,780
Be on your way then.

581
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,050
Park Gae In.

582
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:31,510
Why are you spouting such lies again?

583
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,870
<i>In Hee, you sure have a good appetite.</i>

584
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,060
Because you're a curator,

585
00:34:47,061 --> 00:34:49,290
I was worried you'd be picky.

586
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:57,450
Yes, Mom, In Hee has always been like this,

587
00:34:57,451 --> 00:34:59,450
when confronted with good food,
she forgets everything.

588
00:34:59,451 --> 00:35:01,730
That's right, they say people
who aren't picky about food

589
00:35:01,731 --> 00:35:03,730
also get along well with people.

590
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,550
But then, In Hee,

591
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,880
you don't say much, do you?

592
00:35:08,881 --> 00:35:10,760
<i>Besides saying "hello" when you came in,</i>

593
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:12,760
<i>you haven't said much since then.</i>

594
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,260
I'll get you more!

595
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,450
Say something!

596
00:35:24,451 --> 00:35:26,040
Why are you only eating?

597
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,960
Didn't you bring me here just to eat?

598
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,620
Even so...

599
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,030
Delicious, isn't it?

600
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,340
In Hee, you eat so well, it makes me happy.

601
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:40,400
<i>In Hee, let's have a long chat after dinner.</i>

602
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,520
How you first met Chang Ryul,

603
00:35:42,521 --> 00:35:44,520
how he proposed to you,

604
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,890
from the first to the last,

605
00:35:45,891 --> 00:35:47,670
I'm so curious about everything!

606
00:35:47,671 --> 00:35:50,220
Mom, I'll tell you about all that.

607
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:53,040
In Hee has always been introverted,

608
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:55,040
so she doesn't say a lot.

609
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,030
What are you doing here?

610
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,080
You're really pathetic, Park Gae In.

611
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,700
I heard you were going to battle it out
with Jin Ho?

612
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,550
How did that turn out?

613
00:36:21,551 --> 00:36:23,210
<i>Dam Art Gallery?</i>

614
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,810
Of course I'd have liked to do that.

615
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,020
But Dad was, as usual, one step ahead of me.

616
00:36:28,021 --> 00:36:28,980
In his typical manner.

617
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:30,840
Your father? What did he do?

618
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,510
He went and talked up to
MS Group's Chairman Choi,

619
00:36:33,511 --> 00:36:36,010
and deprived Jin Ho even of
the chance to take part.

620
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,700
<i>That's good then!</i>

621
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:39,760
<i>Because of the long-standing family feud,</i>

622
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:42,600
<i>I was afraid that you, the younger generation
would also be affected.</i>

623
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,750
Why are you standing there?

624
00:36:47,751 --> 00:36:49,080
<i>Come on here!</i>

625
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,510
<i>I have something for In Hee...</i>

626
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,650
<i>This.</i>

627
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:58,000
<i>I received this when I married
Chang Ryul's father.</i>

628
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,640
I want to give it to you.

629
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,430
No, it's alright.

630
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,900
<i>Oh, how pretty!</i>

631
00:37:10,901 --> 00:37:12,710
<i>It suits you so well!</i>

632
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:15,740
Really pretty...

633
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,810
<i>It really is!</i>

634
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,300
Thank you so, so much for today.

635
00:37:34,990 --> 00:37:37,010
Why are you giving this to me?

636
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,860
Mom gave it to you.

637
00:37:38,861 --> 00:37:40,690
She gave it to In Hee.

638
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:42,690
In Hee...

639
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,200
has no right to receive this.

640
00:37:44,201 --> 00:37:45,890
I have no reason to either.

641
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,130
Gae In, even so...

642
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:50,030
Since my mother gave it to you,

643
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:51,230
do what you will with it.

644
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:53,230
Do I even have to deal with such things?

645
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,040
Whether you throw it away,
or give it to In Hee,

646
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,660
you can deal with it yourself.

647
00:37:58,930 --> 00:37:59,890
Gae In!

648
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:31,130
What happened, did you choke?

649
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,200
What on earth did you eat when
you were supposed to go visit a newborn?

650
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,570
Over there,

651
00:38:55,571 --> 00:38:59,210
I finished eating all the food
people brought.

652
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,590
I guess I ate too much.

653
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:03,970
Go in and sleep.

654
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,490
Jin... Jin Ho!

655
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,520
I still don't feel very well.

656
00:39:08,590 --> 00:39:11,600
Can you help me prick my finger?

657
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,930
I don't know how to do that.

658
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:15,040
It's really simple.

659
00:39:15,041 --> 00:39:18,290
You just have to prick me with
a needle right here.

660
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,490
If it's so simple, do it yourself.

661
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,550
Well, that...

662
00:39:20,551 --> 00:39:22,140
It's kind of scary to do it myself.

663
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:24,140
I... No way, I can't do it.

664
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,880
Jin Ho, quick, give it a jab!

665
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,000
Right here?

666
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,590
No, at this spot here.

667
00:39:37,591 --> 00:39:39,050
You know it so well...

668
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:39,870
Right here?

669
00:39:39,871 --> 00:39:40,380
Yes.

670
00:39:49,381 --> 00:39:52,050
Were you planning to pierce through
the finger?!

671
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:56,600
But there's really a lot of black blood
coming out...

672
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,860
Did... Did I do it well?

673
00:39:58,910 --> 00:39:59,630
Yes.

674
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:00,810
It's alright now, isn't it?

675
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,500
Yes.

676
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,970
J.. Jin Ho!

677
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:11,130
Your father and Chang Ryul's father,

678
00:40:11,131 --> 00:40:13,130
did they know each other?

679
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,910
How did you know that?

680
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:23,060
I suddenly remembered,

681
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:26,360
I think Chang Ryul must have
mentioned it long ago.

682
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,540
What did that Chang Ryul say this time...

683
00:40:29,541 --> 00:40:33,510
I don't know about the concrete details.

684
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,440
Chang Ryul's father

685
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,830
used to work at my father's company.

686
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,260
<i>But then...</i>

687
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,020
Chang Ryul's father cooperated with a rival,

688
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,980
and stole the company rights
from my father.

689
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,930
So that's what it is...

690
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:53,240
When Jin Ho, you said

691
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:56,270
you needed to be tougher on yourself...

692
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,630
What's the use of being tough on myself?

693
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:01,760
Even if I pushed myself hard to keep up,

694
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:03,760
I'm still only jogging in place.

695
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,040
Don't give up!

696
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:08,660
It's not like you.

697
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:11,170
Slyly manipulating behind the scenes,

698
00:41:11,171 --> 00:41:13,500
<i>preventing you from taking part,</i>

699
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:14,850
<i>doesn't that make you feel wronged?</i>

700
00:41:14,851 --> 00:41:15,860
About that...

701
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,860
how did you know?

702
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,430
That...

703
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,990
I heard people talk about it at the Gallery.

704
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,200
Said that because of Chang Ryul's father's
machinations,

705
00:41:26,201 --> 00:41:28,060
this happened to you.

706
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,560
Go to bed.

707
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:31,570
That is...

708
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,040
Jin Ho.

709
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,900
Let me make you something delicious.

710
00:41:35,901 --> 00:41:37,510
<i>Didn't I say the last time?</i>

711
00:41:37,511 --> 00:41:39,750
Even when there's something very tiring
and wrongful,

712
00:41:39,751 --> 00:41:41,750
when you're sitting before
a full table of dishes,

713
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,470
you think that everything will be alright,
once you eat and regain strength.

714
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:46,510
You'll feel your energy come back to you.

715
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,560
Be strong, Jin Ho.

716
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,750
Why don't you start by not eating
all kinds of rubbish yourself.

717
00:41:58,501 --> 00:41:59,930
[It's In Hee. This is the address of Director Choi's villa.]

718
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:01,430
[Number 153, Chungpyung Myunsangchun-ri,
Gapyung-gun. Good luck!]

719
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,530
Grab a fishing rod and sit next to me.

720
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,730
What?

721
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,030
With you glaring so fiercely like that,

722
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,410
you're scaring all the fish away.

723
00:42:49,411 --> 00:42:51,030
Ah, yes.

724
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,020
Have you tried fishing before?

725
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,030
No.

726
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:07,890
Take this.

727
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,200
What's this?

728
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,010
The fish here...

729
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,930
like this best.

730
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,840
They're still alive.

731
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,040
Give it here.

732
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,000
You surprised me, Director Jeon.

733
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,310
I thought nothing scared you.

734
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,180
Why...

735
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,160
aren't you talking about
the Dam Art Gallery project?

736
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,910
It's the reason you came, isn't it?

737
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,460
Right now, becoming your friend

738
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,680
might be the better option.

739
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,530
Have you...

740
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:04,300
ever made a love declaration?

741
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:08,050
Having lived so long,

742
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:11,030
I've only done it once.

743
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,640
I've also liked someone before.

744
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:17,050
Mine was a junior at university.

745
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,050
Mine too.

746
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,690
How did it turn out?

747
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,070
The problem was with me.

748
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,300
Before falling in love,

749
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,450
there were so many things I felt
were worth doing.

750
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:32,620
Do you regret it?

751
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:35,430
Well...

752
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,620
As for me...

753
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:41,010
Because that person used to work part-time
at the university library...

754
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,110
Without skipping a day,

755
00:44:43,111 --> 00:44:45,110
I'd go to the library every single day.

756
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:48,620
Then I naturally confessed my feelings.

757
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,880
Even though it didn't last long,

758
00:44:50,881 --> 00:44:52,280
we fell in love.

759
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,040
And then we broke up.

760
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,830
Not much of a story, is it?

761
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,310
Why...

762
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:03,630
did you break up?

763
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:05,440
To that person,

764
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,760
my love was like a poison.

765
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:11,020
That's why,

766
00:45:12,030 --> 00:45:13,840
I suggested the breakup first.

767
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,770
The last time,

768
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,770
that handkerchief I lent you

769
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:21,610
was the only present I have
from that person.

770
00:45:21,611 --> 00:45:23,850
Such a precious gift...

771
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,850
Why did you...

772
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,360
I suppose it's as you said,

773
00:45:29,690 --> 00:45:31,690
so that we could become friends.

774
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:51,710
Because I've done everything I could,

775
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,340
I have no regrets.

776
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,030
The night sky I can see while sitting
on Sanggojae's floor.

777
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,290
I think I'll miss it a lot.

778
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:10,700
In that case,

779
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:14,590
all you have to do is to live here
for a long, long time.

780
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:34,950
You're here?

781
00:46:34,951 --> 00:46:36,950
Oh, Hyung, this...

782
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:39,090
What's this?!

783
00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:40,680
Isn't this Jin Ho hyung's?

784
00:46:40,681 --> 00:46:42,580
Precisely because it isn't his so
I'm wearing it,

785
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:43,640
you have the same one too?

786
00:46:43,641 --> 00:46:45,010
Because Jin Ho hyung has the same one,

787
00:46:45,011 --> 00:46:45,900
I bought the same one too!

788
00:46:45,901 --> 00:46:46,550
Are the two of you going out?

789
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:48,620
Well, Hye Mi likes him, so I'm copying him!

790
00:46:48,621 --> 00:46:50,470
In future, whatever Jin Ho hyung
wears or eats,

791
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,010
I'll copy him.

792
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,700
Hyung!

793
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:55,860
Don't give this shirt to Sang Jun!

794
00:46:55,861 --> 00:46:57,110
He's going to stretch it!

795
00:46:57,111 --> 00:46:58,220
This kid...

796
00:46:58,221 --> 00:46:59,570
Tae Hoon, if you

797
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,020
continue not recognizing the boundaries
between work and personal situations,

798
00:47:02,021 --> 00:47:03,320
you should just quit.

799
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,500
Wasn't Jin Ho hyung a bit too cold with me?

800
00:47:09,501 --> 00:47:11,840
It was because you're copying
his dressing style like this!

801
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:13,040
You... too...

802
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,530
are copying his dressing...

803
00:47:14,531 --> 00:47:15,930
I'm different, Kid!

804
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:19,370
My relationship with Jin Ho...

805
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,750
has a secret side you know nothing about.

806
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,020
<i>Jin Ho, are you crying?</i>

807
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,570
<i>{\a6}What would real love taste like?</i>

808
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:48,050
<i>{\a6}Is it a sweet feeling?</i>

809
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:54,140
<i>{\a6}What would a kiss that consumes
the darkness be like?</i>

810
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,004
{\a6}Would the sky light up...

811
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,040
What on earth am I doing?

812
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,060
But that...

813
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,130
what do you mean by that?

814
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,810
Even if I'm not here,

815
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:12,690
someone will take care of things for you,

816
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:14,810
so don't worry and keep up the progress.

817
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:17,290
But then why suddenly...

818
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,310
Could it be...

819
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:21,690
because of the Dam Art Gallery?

820
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,030
Because of that,

821
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,010
Director Jeon must be quite worried, right?

822
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,770
Yes.

823
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:31,050
The Dam Art Gallery,

824
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:33,460
I'd like to challenge it.

825
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,820
If it works out, I'll remain here.

826
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:37,280
But if it doesn't,

827
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:39,040
I'll have to leave.

828
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,580
Director Choi!

829
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,660
That's why I came here to tell you
in person.

830
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:45,030
Just in case,

831
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,660
I don't have time to say goodbye
when I have to leave.

832
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,120
Well, then.

833
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,060
Director Choi!

834
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:01,030
Fighting!

835
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:16,000
The concept has been finalized, hasn't it?

836
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:19,909
Do you think they'll like it if we barge
in there without an appointment

837
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:21,407
and offer to give a briefing about
our concept for the Dam Art Gallery project?

838
00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:22,500
Kid.

839
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,470
Is that person someone for whom
we should set aside a time especially?

840
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:28,710
In order to settle this well,

841
00:49:28,711 --> 00:49:30,710
we'll have to be thick-skinned about it!

842
00:49:30,711 --> 00:49:31,740
Understand?

843
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:37,560
<i>That girl...</i>

844
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:42,280
<i>Wasn't she the one who ruined your wedding?</i>

845
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,490
<i>Chairman, what excellent vision you have,</i>

846
00:49:44,491 --> 00:49:47,520
how can you remember a person
you've only seen once?

847
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:50,360
How did you know it was Park Gae In?

848
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,530
What she's doing here...

849
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,020
go and find out.

850
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:54,810
Yes.

851
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:08,020
You see, what did I say?

852
00:50:08,191 --> 00:50:10,770
Looking him up without making
an appointment wouldn't work.

853
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:12,360
<i>Chairman!</i>

854
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,060
I've found out!

855
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,060
Park Gae In is the daughter of
Professor Park Chul Han.

856
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,060
Director Choi asked her to

857
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:24,060
design the childrens' recreation room

858
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,520
and especially invited her.

859
00:50:25,521 --> 00:50:26,260
What?

860
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,330
Who is whose daughter?

861
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:31,030
Park Gae In is Professor Park Chul Han's
daughter.

862
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:35,290
You ditched Park Chul Han's daughter

863
00:50:35,291 --> 00:50:38,030
and went to get married with
some unknown nobody?

864
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:39,470
What's with that?

865
00:50:39,471 --> 00:50:41,470
Do you know who Park Chul Han is?

866
00:50:41,471 --> 00:50:43,560
He's a legend among legends
in the construction field,

867
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:45,920
and you dumped the daughter
of this legend?!

868
00:50:45,921 --> 00:50:49,700
Father, whoever's the daughter of whoever,
is that important now?

869
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,420
What did you say?

870
00:50:52,421 --> 00:50:54,420
Have you done anything right?

871
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:55,570
Oh, I really...

872
00:50:55,741 --> 00:50:57,860
Is there really no more hope for
the Dam Art Gallery project?

873
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:00,000
Don't even mention it.

874
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,270
When I tried looking up the homepage
just now, it had been closed down.

875
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:06,540
It looks like the participants aren't
very happy about it.

876
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:09,000
After a few days, I'm sure
a confirmation will be out.

877
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,770
In any case, I think you should take
that shirt off.

878
00:51:11,771 --> 00:51:13,280
It really doesn't suit you.

879
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:14,610
You're starting on this again?!

880
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:16,240
Take it off, I said take it off!

881
00:51:16,241 --> 00:51:18,210
I don't want to look like
a couple with you!

882
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,730
It really doesn't suit you, quick!

883
00:51:19,731 --> 00:51:20,690
Hey, the coffee!

884
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:22,930
You spilt my coffee!

885
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:24,420
You might as well take it off, then.

886
00:51:24,421 --> 00:51:25,310
What's there to take off?

887
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,010
Take it off!

888
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:27,840
I have no other clothes besides this!

889
00:51:27,841 --> 00:51:28,590
I don't care, just take it off!

890
00:51:28,591 --> 00:51:30,150
Really, don't be like this,

891
00:51:30,151 --> 00:51:33,060
<i>I beg you, seriously.</i>

892
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,150
<i>Just take it off, Hyung.</i>

893
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:38,040
<i>Take it off...</i>

894
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:41,000
Gae In.

895
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:44,060
This is...

896
00:51:44,061 --> 00:51:45,430
Don't tell me...

897
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:47,690
The two of you...

898
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,690
No, no...

899
00:51:49,691 --> 00:51:50,770
Let me explain.

900
00:51:50,771 --> 00:51:52,700
Sang Jun, how could you do this?

901
00:51:52,701 --> 00:51:55,560
<i>You know very well what Jin Ho
is going through now.</i>

902
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,680
As Jin Ho's lov...

903
00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:02,560
I'm really disappointed, Sang Jun.

904
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,570
I really wanted to wish your love well.

905
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:07,660
- How could you...
- What's happening?

906
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:09,880
No, that is...

907
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:10,980
Gae In, she...

908
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,210
misunderstood my relationship with Tae Hoon.

909
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,610
You know you're the only one for me.

910
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:22,770
Are you shy because Gae In is here?

911
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:25,470
You and Tae Hoon should really...

912
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,740
You're jealous, aren't you?

913
00:52:26,741 --> 00:52:27,440
Get out!

914
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,290
Well done.

915
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:34,300
A two-timing cad like that shouldn't be
forgiven easily.

916
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:40,120
We were never going out together.

917
00:52:40,121 --> 00:52:41,210
The two of us.

918
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:41,810
What?

919
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,380
You misunderstood from the start.

920
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:45,830
What?

921
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,060
G.. G...

922
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,257
I...

923
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,270
am actually not...

924
00:53:01,271 --> 00:53:01,900
You know,

925
00:53:01,901 --> 00:53:04,430
we really had a misunderstanding just now,

926
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,350
I really don't have such a relationship
with Tae Hoon.

927
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,010
He's just a man.

928
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:13,040
That guy is really...

929
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:16,820
I nearly forgot why I came here!

930
00:53:16,821 --> 00:53:19,100
I just came from a meeting with Director Choi.

931
00:53:19,271 --> 00:53:21,370
The Dam Art Gallery project might
turn out well after all,

932
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:23,120
so he said not to worry.

933
00:53:23,530 --> 00:53:25,510
<i>That's why I came here.</i>

934
00:53:25,910 --> 00:53:28,010
He said he'd use his position as a stake.

935
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,270
Using that as a stake to fight it out,

936
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:32,270
he's sure to win, isn't he?

937
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:33,710
That's why,

938
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:36,040
don't feel too down about it.

939
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:39,850
You could have just called
to tell me such a thing.

940
00:53:39,851 --> 00:53:42,250
Your smiling face,

941
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,020
I wanted to see it directly.

942
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:51,590
Yes. Yes.

943
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:55,420
Park Gae In still hasn't returned
to the art gallery.

944
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,400
Yes.

945
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,410
He's next to me.

946
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:00,280
<i>Yes.</i>

947
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:01,480
<i>Yes?</i>

948
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,000
It's Park Gae In!

949
00:54:10,170 --> 00:54:12,450
<i>She's getting off from Jeon Jin Ho's car?</i>

950
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:17,310
What relationship do the two have?

951
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:21,040
It's because of me.

952
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,620
<i>She knows I don't get along with him,</i>

953
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:25,830
so this is her revenge.

954
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,000
I don't think that's the case...

955
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:34,320
Chang Ryul!

956
00:54:34,321 --> 00:54:36,030
Hey! Joe!

957
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,520
How long has it been now?

958
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:40,560
I know, right?

959
00:54:40,561 --> 00:54:41,950
I heard you came to Korea.

960
00:54:41,951 --> 00:54:43,180
I heard you got married?

961
00:54:43,181 --> 00:54:44,050
<i>That's right,</i>

962
00:54:44,051 --> 00:54:46,810
<i>she a curator in this art gallery,
isn't she?</i>

963
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,590
Yes, well...

964
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:50,350
I got married, didn't I...

965
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,440
But then how did you know about that?

966
00:54:52,441 --> 00:54:54,440
Oh, Director Choi,

967
00:54:54,441 --> 00:54:56,440
I kind of know him.

968
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,880
My friend is also considering holding
her personal exhibition here,

969
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:01,370
so I came with her to check it out.

970
00:55:01,371 --> 00:55:02,430
Is that so?

971
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,260
You know Director Choi?

972
00:55:04,261 --> 00:55:05,990
Just a little, on exchange.

973
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:08,760
In any case, because we weren't
of the same kind,

974
00:55:08,761 --> 00:55:10,350
we weren't very close either.

975
00:55:10,351 --> 00:55:11,860
A different kind?

976
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:13,020
What do you mean by that?

977
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,590
Well... Director Choi is... special.

978
00:55:18,290 --> 00:55:19,590
Special?

979
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,000
I don't understand.
What's that supposed to mean?

980
00:55:23,001 --> 00:55:25,000
Well let me ask you something.

981
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:26,590
Do you know what he likes?

982
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:29,040
I don't know, you tell me.

983
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,040
<i>If I'd known it meant to much to you,</i>

984
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:35,040
I'd have returned it to you sooner.

985
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,040
I'm sorry about that.

986
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:39,800
Since you've returned it,

987
00:55:39,801 --> 00:55:40,860
it's all right.

988
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,630
I've heard from Park Gae In.

989
00:55:47,190 --> 00:55:48,560
For the Dam Art Gallery project,

990
00:55:50,870 --> 00:55:52,980
you're going against the management
and threatening to quit.

991
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,560
Whichever way it turns out,

992
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:58,040
I wanted to thank you.

993
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,730
Do you know?

994
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,550
Whenever I'm with you,

995
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,000
I feel strangely happy.

996
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:08,580
I feel the same way when meeting you.

997
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,810
Then you must know I like you.

998
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:16,010
I like you too.

999
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:25,540
Is that true?

1000
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:26,620
Yes.

1001
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:29,030
You're a very attractive person.

1002
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,450
Come on, Joe, just spit it out!

1003
00:56:39,451 --> 00:56:40,190
What is it?

1004
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,340
Ah, never mind, just forget it.

1005
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,020
Man, what's your problem?

1006
00:56:44,021 --> 00:56:45,630
I was wondering about that anyway,

1007
00:56:45,631 --> 00:56:48,020
so you've got to tell me what
he likes, okay?

1008
00:56:48,021 --> 00:56:51,600
Well... You'll never be able
to fulfill his desire.

1009
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,070
What Director Choi likes is...

1010
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,070
A man.

1011
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:03,730
I'm sorry but...

1012
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,020
What did you just say?

1013
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:10,010
It's as you heard,

1014
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:12,680
from the first time I set my eyes on you,

1015
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:15,230
my heart stirred.

1016
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,590
And that day,

1017
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:23,030
when I heard about your preference,

1018
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,060
I felt there was a fateful connection
between us.

1019
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,030
Surely not...

1020
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:32,890
Then...

1021
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,150
I didn't...

1022
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:37,780
wish to make another declaration.

1023
00:57:38,190 --> 00:57:40,330
But since we're in the same boat,

1024
00:57:41,190 --> 00:57:43,140
I believed you'd understand me.

1025
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:44,060
<i>That's why...</i>

1026
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,970
<i>I gathered up the courage to confess now.</i>

1027
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:52,310
I'm not...

1028
00:57:52,311 --> 00:57:54,550
asking you to rush into a decision now.

1029
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,550
Slowly...

1030
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:59,070
we'll give each other time,

1031
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,010
to get to know each other first.

1032
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:30,040
Oh my... and who might this be?

1033
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:36,479
I thought a little nothing company
like yours

1034
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:39,980
would surely have been eliminated from
this project already.

1035
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,380
How is it that you still have things
to do here?

1036
00:58:42,381 --> 00:58:44,720
I'm not in the mood to speak with you,
so just go.

1037
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,760
It's not it, is it?
It couldn't be.

1038
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,087
The almighty Jeon Jin Ho wouldn't stoop to

1039
00:58:51,088 --> 00:58:52,940
pretending to have queer leanings

1040
00:58:52,941 --> 00:58:55,380
in order to seduce Director Choi, would he?

1041
00:58:55,930 --> 00:58:59,350
If you want to fight it out,
you shouldn't stoop to underhanded means.

1042
00:58:59,351 --> 00:59:02,369
Why are you always hovering around here,
you make me sick!

1043
00:59:10,010 --> 00:59:11,430
What's this now?

1044
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,440
Were you trying to prove something?

1045
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,900
Well, I'm disappointed, really disappointed.

1046
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:21,900
Jeon Jin Ho, you're a disappointment.

1047
00:59:23,410 --> 00:59:25,000
I didn't think you were the kind of person,

1048
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:27,280
who would make use of the fact
that Director Choi was gay.

1049
00:59:27,281 --> 00:59:28,990
I've never made use of him.

1050
00:59:28,991 --> 00:59:30,120
Then what is it?

1051
00:59:30,121 --> 00:59:31,280
Are you going out with him?

1052
00:59:31,281 --> 00:59:32,990
Why are you always coming in
and out of here,

1053
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,410
you make me sick!

1054
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:44,780
<i>Answer me.</i>

1055
00:59:44,870 --> 00:59:46,850
<i>Admit that you're making use of him.</i>

1056
00:59:47,110 --> 00:59:48,030
If not,

1057
00:59:48,270 --> 00:59:50,697
are you really gay?

1058
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:00,270
Answer me.

1059
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,370
That's right.

1060
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,040
I'm...

1061
01:00:20,490 --> 01:00:21,470
gay.

1062
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,010
Is that what it is?

1063
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:46,790
You're really... not even a man?

1064
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,360
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

1065
01:00:49,361 --> 01:00:50,540
<i>If he knew you were like this,</i>

1066
01:00:50,541 --> 01:00:53,190
<i>how would your late father feel?</i>

1067
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:55,040
<i>His only son,</i>

1068
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,040
<i>letting such a thing happen to
the family line.</i>

1069
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,010
But then,

1070
01:00:59,011 --> 01:01:01,010
when did you start being like this?

1071
01:01:01,270 --> 01:01:03,200
You should really have told me earlier!

1072
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,940
If I'd known, even out of pity for you,

1073
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,260
<i>I'd have given way for you,</i>

1074
01:01:07,261 --> 01:01:08,180
<i>and not snatched things away.</i>

1075
01:01:08,181 --> 01:01:09,670
- And also...
- Stop it!

1076
01:01:10,830 --> 01:01:12,800
What are you, to sneer at this person?

1077
01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:14,030
<i>Gae In!</i>

1078
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,530
<i>What have you done so great
to despise this person?</i>

1079
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:19,680
It's not like Jin Ho wished to be born
this way.

1080
01:01:19,681 --> 01:01:20,380
Enough.

1081
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,000
<i>Only a man who loves women is a man.</i>

1082
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:25,430
<i>Isn't a man who loves another man
also a man?</i>

1083
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,170
<i>So you're saying you're a real man?</i>

1084
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,610
Because you're such a man,
you broke my heart like that?

1085
01:01:30,611 --> 01:01:32,020
I said stop it!

1086
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,190
Jin Ho...

1087
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:37,490
Gae In!

1088
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:39,170
What's wrong with you now?

1089
01:01:39,171 --> 01:01:40,010
Let go.

1090
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:47,620
Jin Ho.

1091
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:50,910
Let's talk.

1092
01:01:50,911 --> 01:01:52,140
What's there to talk about?

1093
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,060
I have nothing to say.

1094
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:03,720
Get lost.

1095
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:05,060
Park Gae In!

1096
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,640
What on earth is your relationship
with that jerk?

1097
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:10,520
Why are you always with that dirty jerk?

1098
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,320
So now you'd even go out with gays?

1099
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:16,560
<i>Dirty?</i>

1100
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:18,300
<i>What's so dirty?</i>

1101
01:02:18,590 --> 01:02:20,300
Why would Jin Ho be dirty?

1102
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,360
Be it a man or woman,

1103
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,360
love is between two people.

1104
01:02:25,130 --> 01:02:28,020
You're just a nothing who's never
loved another.

1105
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,020
So who are you?

1106
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,040
To say that Jin Ho is dirty.

1107
01:02:32,690 --> 01:02:33,650
Gae In...

1108
01:02:33,651 --> 01:02:35,650
What's... wrong with you?

1109
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:39,570
<i>You weren't even like this when we broke up!</i>

1110
01:02:40,430 --> 01:02:42,000
Even at the wedding hall,

1111
01:02:42,290 --> 01:02:44,310
you never even slapped me!

1112
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,470
<i>So what are you doing now?</i>

1113
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:48,040
That's right.

1114
01:02:51,140 --> 01:02:52,610
I was like that then.

1115
01:02:52,611 --> 01:02:53,790
Even when I was forced to suffer
such indignities,

1116
01:02:53,791 --> 01:02:55,640
I was a fool who couldn't even say
a word in my own defense.

1117
01:02:55,641 --> 01:02:57,450
But no more of that now.

1118
01:02:57,930 --> 01:02:59,850
I suppose Jin Ho must have changed me.

1119
01:02:59,851 --> 01:03:04,280
<i>{\a6}That person is...</i>

1120
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:08,010
<i>{\a6}That person is</i>

1121
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:11,570
<i>{\a6}That person is</i>

1122
01:03:11,601 --> 01:03:15,040
<i>{\a6}That person is the only one who lulls
my heart to sleep</i>

1123
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:18,280
<i>{\a6}Like a fool</i>

1124
01:03:18,281 --> 01:03:22,210
<i>{\a6}I've finally figured it out</i>

1125
01:03:22,641 --> 01:03:28,010
<i>{\a6}That it keeps calling for that person</i>

1126
01:03:29,830 --> 01:03:37,630
<i>{\a6}Because I can't live without that person
in my life</i>

Are only men who love women
to be considered men?

1133
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:48,920
<i>So please park somewhere
and just breathe deeply.</i>

1134
01:03:48,921 --> 01:03:50,070
You'll do that, right?

1135
01:03:50,071 --> 01:03:51,320
Sang Jun oppa,

1136
01:03:51,321 --> 01:03:52,530
is it possible you like men?

1137
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:53,610
You know something...

1138
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,730
Could it be I'm really in love with you?

1139
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,650
What is it you want to say right now?

1140
01:03:58,110 --> 01:03:59,940
I want to start over with you.

1141
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,560
C-c-com-coming out?

1142
01:04:02,561 --> 01:04:03,620
Congratulations.

1143
01:04:03,621 --> 01:04:04,870
On getting another chance.

1144
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:05,710
Dam Art Gallery? Why?

1145
01:04:05,711 --> 01:04:07,010
To meet with Director Choi.

1146
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:08,000
Are you going on a date?

1147
01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:11,900
Do I appear to be someone who would use
this project as bait to win over someone's feelings?

1148
01:04:11,901 --> 01:04:13,050
Han Chang Ryul...

1149
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,050
is my son.

1150
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:18,100
Do you really want to start over with me?

1151
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:19,140
Park Gae In!

1152
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:19,960
I...

1153
01:04:20,170 --> 01:04:21,160
have something to say to you.

1154
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:24,460
Should we...
