1
00:01:06,104 --> 00:01:07,355
NAKED HARBOUR

2
00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:15,441
I'm getting married.

3
00:01:26,709 --> 00:01:27,858
Whatever...

4
00:02:03,318 --> 00:02:04,774
Where's my money?

5
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,837
We gave you more time.

6
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,417
Gimme your wallet!
Where's my money?

7
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:25,996
Listen up. If you don't pay
within a week-

8
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:30,495
I'll screw the bitch as payment.
Got it?

9
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:45,632
Heel!

10
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,684
Max, heel!

11
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,605
Hi.
- Hi.

12
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:59,666
No homework?
- Waiting for Mom, forgot my keys.

13
00:03:00,772 --> 00:03:03,388
Should I come and baby-sit again?
- No.

14
00:03:04,653 --> 00:03:07,872
I've got the new Singstar.
If you wanna try it out?

15
00:03:11,414 --> 00:03:15,067
Are you eating chocolate?
Give me some so you won't get fat.

16
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:19,754
People eat chocolate when they're
in love. Are you in love?

17
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:23,766
Thanks.

18
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:32,301
Hi.

19
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:35,582
Hi.

20
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:41,765
How did it go?
- Great. You'll see.

21
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:51,955
They said I've got talent.
They'll call.

22
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,067
It's a bit stuffy in here.

23
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:11,047
I'm pretty sure they'll pick me.

24
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:23,184
Super food, full grain!

25
00:04:26,193 --> 00:04:28,844
If you work out,
you gotta eat properly.

26
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:34,164
We've got some heavy
training ahead of us today.

27
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,828
Unsalted porridge.

28
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:39,371
Salt is for old women who
can't taste anything.

29
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:41,023
Feel this, feel it!

30
00:04:41,476 --> 00:04:42,899
I don't want to.

31
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,251
Pumping iron! With the guys!

32
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,050
Look att his.

33
00:04:51,879 --> 00:04:53,870
It's fat. This here is fat.

34
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,968
But it's firm on the surface.

35
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,250
It's fat. Viscelar fat.
- Even though it's firm?

36
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:02,595
Yes. It's engorged
around the organs.

37
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:05,430
But there's hardly any
on the surface.

38
00:05:05,842 --> 00:05:09,358
What you need now is gym, gym
and gym, and a strict diet.

39
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,903
Do we have a deal? Good.

40
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:23,878
A friend lent me the cash.
- It's fucking awesome!

41
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:29,603
Put it on.

42
00:05:32,489 --> 00:05:34,138
Not so rough. Gently!

43
00:05:44,732 --> 00:05:45,596
I do.

44
00:06:02,936 --> 00:06:04,289
More champagne!

45
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:17,290
There's mud water in the glass.

46
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,111
How did it get in there?
- I can't tell.

47
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,155
Lauri, pass me the knife.

48
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,379
I need to answer this.

49
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,994
Finally the day of the ball came.

50
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:31,101
The stepsisters left for the castle,
and Cinderella felt so very sad.

51
00:06:29,903 --> 00:06:32,622
When they had gone,
she burst into tears.

52
00:06:34,344 --> 00:06:36,858
Why can't the prince
find Cinderella?

53
00:06:39,585 --> 00:06:41,201
He does, in the end.

54
00:06:54,189 --> 00:06:55,611
They're wimps...

55
00:07:02,951 --> 00:07:04,407
Give me kisses...

56
00:07:06,472 --> 00:07:09,988
You've got a banana in your hand.
- I feel dirty already.

57
00:07:15,914 --> 00:07:18,770
That's not erotic at all.
That's disgusting.

58
00:07:27,277 --> 00:07:29,825
Stop whining
and try to have some fun.

59
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,619
What are you staring at?

60
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:53,219
Try running this zoo for just one
day, you'd know how tiring it is.

61
00:07:55,924 --> 00:07:58,347
The kids are in daycare.
- Even so.

62
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,492
I've tried to explain a hundred
times, but you just don't get it.

63
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,599
Good night.

64
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:23,048
I don't wanna go.
- Come along now.

65
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,881
Mom, where's Moomin?

66
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:35,748
Moomin's seeing the doctor today,
he'll make his foot better.

67
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,700
I love you.

68
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,710
You mean so much to me.

69
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:29,338
I haven't got time for this.
- Wait.

70
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:38,442
"I've loved you the most.
Yours, Marika."

71
00:10:42,764 --> 00:10:44,756
Why are you giving me this?

72
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,097
Hey, honey...

73
00:11:50,261 --> 00:11:53,015
I want Walt to sing solo
for the chorus...

74
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:55,657
Must I?
- Yes, it will sound good.

75
00:11:56,863 --> 00:11:59,514
The rest of you
will join in at the end.

76
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:03,257
Shut your face!

77
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:08,898
Look who's here...

78
00:12:10,306 --> 00:12:11,853
Russkie!
- Commie!

79
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:14,571
Homo!

80
00:12:41,433 --> 00:12:42,298
Next!

81
00:12:50,556 --> 00:12:52,308
Hi, I'm Milla...
- Hi.

82
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,559
Hi, I'm Milla.
I can do anything.

83
00:13:01,558 --> 00:13:05,074
So what do you do for a living?
- Nothing, at the moment.

84
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:16,078
Ok, so let's take a few shots.

85
00:13:18,963 --> 00:13:22,683
Just look at the camera,
you know what to do. Flirt a little.

86
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:32,544
Push your hips forward,
you look like a friggin' pickle.

87
00:13:33,726 --> 00:13:36,275
Maybe you should sing something?
- Ok.

88
00:13:58,052 --> 00:13:59,167
Thank you.

89
00:14:10,215 --> 00:14:12,264
You did good. Great attitude.

90
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,818
How was school today?
- It was Ok.

91
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,002
What was for lunch?
- Sausages.

92
00:14:48,104 --> 00:14:50,528
Sausages, pig food. Flour and water.

93
00:14:54,146 --> 00:14:55,602
And after school?

94
00:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,781
Excellent! Now wasn't it tasty?
- I guess.

95
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:08,021
You gotta eat five times a day.
And then what?

96
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,885
Peltsi's dad bought me a burger.
- You ate a burger?

97
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:19,784
Jesus Christ! What did we agree
about burgers?

98
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:22,366
We don't eat burgers!
- No.

99
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:26,787
And you guzzled a giant burger,
splattering grease down your chin!

100
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:31,133
I thought we had a fucking deal!

101
00:15:32,755 --> 00:15:35,407
We're in training
and we don't eat crap!

102
00:15:36,276 --> 00:15:37,391
Ok, sorry.

103
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:42,314
What did we agree about
kebabs and pizzas and burgers!

104
00:15:43,358 --> 00:15:44,814
They're pig food!

105
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,737
Forcing a kid to eat
shit like that-

106
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,573
while we had a fucking deal!

107
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,083
Don't you have any-fucking-thing
else to fucking say?

108
00:15:57,441 --> 00:15:59,990
Nope. Don't go anywhere.
Listen to me.

109
00:16:00,522 --> 00:16:03,139
Look me in the eye. Apologize.
- Sorry.

110
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,687
Promise we won't eat any more junk?
- Ok, Ok.

111
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:09,653
Now go to your room.
You're grounded for a week.

112
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:11,994
God damnit!

113
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,243
Nice apartment.

114
00:16:41,452 --> 00:16:43,170
Is there someone here?

115
00:16:43,893 --> 00:16:45,645
I have someone with me.

116
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,926
This is Antero.
- Hey.

117
00:16:49,494 --> 00:16:50,847
This is my son.

118
00:16:51,494 --> 00:16:54,919
Look at all the food he brought us.
We'll have a feast.

119
00:17:00,577 --> 00:17:01,930
Well, howdy ho.

120
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:07,137
How's it hanging, son?
You speak Finnish?

121
00:17:07,178 --> 00:17:09,727
I've got something for you.
For keeps.

122
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,811
What do you say?
- Thanks.

123
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,057
No problem.
- We'll eat soon.

124
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:24,054
We could go see a match
together this weekend.

125
00:17:24,302 --> 00:17:26,919
Or during the week,
since I'm on leave.

126
00:17:27,383 --> 00:17:28,931
Unemployment leave.

127
00:17:41,907 --> 00:17:43,829
Hey, Walt. Give us a hand.

128
00:17:46,548 --> 00:17:49,404
We're playing Singstar,
I can't get it to...

129
00:17:50,629 --> 00:17:51,744
Come here.

130
00:17:52,829 --> 00:17:56,584
It's more fun when there's three.
- Walt's such a good singer.

131
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,063
I can't get it to work.

132
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,323
Elvis! I mean Pelvis!

133
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,945
When do people die?

134
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,376
Every single person is born,
grows up and dies.

135
00:18:46,843 --> 00:18:50,962
First you're born, then you grow
into a little girl and then you die.

136
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,998
Are your eyes closed when you die?
- Could be.

137
00:19:03,447 --> 00:19:07,305
It's a little like sleeping.
- Where do people go when they die?

138
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:13,032
In our religion people go to Heaven.

139
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,089
I don't wanna die yet.

140
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,945
You don't need to worry about it.

141
00:19:30,053 --> 00:19:33,706
I'm sure you'll get to live
tens and tens and tens of years.

142
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,787
You too.

143
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,952
I need money.
At least six grand.

144
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,067
Come here.

145
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:55,646
I want you to do something to me.

146
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:58,070
Like what?

147
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:29,391
Shit...

148
00:21:31,363 --> 00:21:32,352
Fuck...

149
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:39,641
I love you.
- I love you too.

150
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,783
I promise to protect you.

151
00:21:58,409 --> 00:22:01,026
Give me some space.
Just a little room!

152
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:07,654
Don't start eat me like that.
I'm getting out of here.

153
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:14,505
Liris, where are you going?
- None of your fucking business.

154
00:22:16,574 --> 00:22:18,121
Get your hands off!

155
00:22:19,814 --> 00:22:22,966
Who wants to stay in your
grandma's stinking flat?

156
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,771
Stay home. I haven't got any money.

157
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:31,171
God, those paintings are ugly.
Who is that fucking cow anyway?

158
00:22:31,377 --> 00:22:33,494
Get your hands off me, nigger.

159
00:22:36,899 --> 00:22:38,651
This god damned door...

160
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,071
Liris, honey!

161
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,113
Liris!

162
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:50,577
What's wrong?
- Ok, I forgive you.

163
00:22:56,623 --> 00:22:58,478
Can we go to the bar now?

164
00:23:00,704 --> 00:23:02,161
Sorry, I'm sorry.

165
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:06,336
Got any fags?
- No man, sorry.

166
00:23:10,107 --> 00:23:11,358
You have one?

167
00:23:33,873 --> 00:23:37,422
Draw the name and picture
of the person you love the most-

168
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:40,257
there, in that circle in the centre.

169
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:45,933
Who would you miss the most
if you never saw them again?

170
00:23:50,117 --> 00:23:52,938
It can be your mom or dad,
or both of them.

171
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:55,814
Or just your mom.

172
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:02,739
And the next ring is for
the second dearest person-

173
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,635
and so on.

174
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:11,797
Very good.

175
00:24:12,642 --> 00:24:14,564
And write their names too.

176
00:24:26,725 --> 00:24:27,738
MAX
MOM

177
00:25:01,654 --> 00:25:04,078
I'm so happy you're here to meet me.

178
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,842
Good dog, best dog.

179
00:25:08,816 --> 00:25:11,671
I'm having some cereal.
What are you having?

180
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,454
Wait, wait. Now!
- No!

181
00:25:58,388 --> 00:26:01,813
Hey, Walt. Wanna go out and
play football or something?

182
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,408
Football? It's too cold outside.

183
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:10,726
Then go to the other room
and watch some TV.

184
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,705
We'll call you back in.

185
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,919
Would you stop staring?

186
00:27:21,168 --> 00:27:23,626
You're driving me crazy.
- Likewise.

187
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,809
Stop clinging!

188
00:28:07,299 --> 00:28:08,517
Want a beer?

189
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,749
As long as it's cold.

190
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:25,975
You seeing someone?
- Yes.

191
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:36,249
Would you like to see my new tattoo?

192
00:28:41,228 --> 00:28:42,343
Would you?

193
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:16,878
I wish you would sometimes stay
and sleep next to me.

194
00:30:34,935 --> 00:30:39,054
When you wander alone in the night,
you might meet someone your kind.

195
00:30:45,378 --> 00:30:47,494
Together, the road is lighter.

196
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,650
Out you go!

197
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:07,379
No loitering. Out to the yard.

198
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,348
Excellent!

199
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:52,610
Go for it! Great!

200
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:57,007
Now box!

201
00:31:59,116 --> 00:32:01,539
Great. Gimme some porn.
Gimme porn!

202
00:32:06,678 --> 00:32:08,031
Can I help you?

203
00:32:08,918 --> 00:32:11,376
I'm here to see Anders.
- Over here.

204
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,572
Wait over there.
There's food and stuff.

205
00:32:30,003 --> 00:32:33,326
Pretend it's your ex-boyfriend.
Orhis new girlfriend.

206
00:32:33,244 --> 00:32:34,997
Punch! With both hands.

207
00:32:38,485 --> 00:32:39,908
Grit your teeth!

208
00:32:49,688 --> 00:32:50,450
Hi.

209
00:32:53,369 --> 00:32:55,292
Remember me?
- Of course.

210
00:33:00,851 --> 00:33:04,674
I just... If you choose me, you
can do anything you want to me.

211
00:33:07,172 --> 00:33:08,219
Anything.

212
00:33:10,093 --> 00:33:13,450
What are you talking about?
I'm just the photographer.

213
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,510
I have these photos.

214
00:33:22,776 --> 00:33:25,496
And really, I'm willing to do
anything...

215
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:33,175
Could you take pictures of me?

216
00:33:35,059 --> 00:33:38,109
I don't make those decisions.
It's not up to me.

217
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:43,175
If you could take pictures of me...
Pictures like... you know.

218
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:47,434
I'd do anything, anything at all.

219
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,916
Can you take pictures of me?

220
00:33:54,144 --> 00:33:55,008
Okay.

221
00:33:58,505 --> 00:34:00,757
I'll do anything...
- I said Ok.

222
00:34:01,586 --> 00:34:02,701
Ok.
- Ok.

223
00:34:38,635 --> 00:34:40,990
What do you want?
What can you do?

224
00:34:42,356 --> 00:34:44,278
Do you play an instrument?

225
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,469
Can you dance? Can you?

226
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:52,409
I don't know.

227
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,420
Some Big Brother-type thing
could suit you.

228
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,362
You were on it. I remember.

229
00:35:38,289 --> 00:35:40,281
Will you take pictures of me?

230
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,228
I'll do anything.

231
00:35:54,813 --> 00:35:56,805
Look, I have these tattoos.

232
00:36:01,095 --> 00:36:04,748
You can't walk around showing
pictures like that of yourself.

233
00:36:05,656 --> 00:36:09,309
Saying that you're willing to do
anything. It's real stupid.

234
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,454
We're all young once. Even me.

235
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:21,561
It's a disease that cures
itself over time.

236
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:24,455
So it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Ok?

237
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:28,609
I'm not that young.

238
00:36:30,102 --> 00:36:32,754
I mean...
Lots of stars start off young.

239
00:36:35,623 --> 00:36:38,377
Like Britney and Rihanna,
they were 16 too.

240
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:43,989
What do you want to be?
A celebrity? A model?

241
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:49,919
I just don't want to be ordinary.

242
00:36:51,107 --> 00:36:54,657
I want my name to ring bells.
To stand out from the crowd.

243
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,584
So you just want to be a celebrity?
- I don't want to be ordinary.

244
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,840
I want my name to ring bells.

245
00:37:18,874 --> 00:37:20,296
Leave me a bite.

246
00:37:20,914 --> 00:37:22,735
Huh?
- Leave me a bite.

247
00:37:24,635 --> 00:37:27,252
You're on a diet.
- Just leave me some.

248
00:37:27,756 --> 00:37:29,474
Fuck off!
- Fuck off!

249
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,753
You should be training.

250
00:37:49,681 --> 00:37:52,537
You should be training.
- Take it easy, Dad.

251
00:37:55,443 --> 00:37:58,298
Let's go.
We have to stick to our agreement.

252
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:15,982
I'm down to my last coin.

253
00:38:16,248 --> 00:38:19,400
But you've got unpaid winnings.
Just twenty cents?

254
00:38:20,329 --> 00:38:22,650
You'll pay me back?
- Absolutely.

255
00:38:29,171 --> 00:38:31,184
You're fucking unbelievable!

256
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,363
I want cider!
- We need money.

257
00:38:39,894 --> 00:38:42,317
If I leave you, you'll be all alone.

258
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:45,205
You'll never find somebody new.

259
00:38:45,935 --> 00:38:49,292
A lazy parasite like you,
who can't get anything done.

260
00:38:52,777 --> 00:38:55,325
How do you think you'll
get the money?

261
00:38:55,297 --> 00:38:57,220
By pacing around the flat?

262
00:38:58,018 --> 00:39:01,238
"We need money". "Ukki will help".
"We need money".

263
00:39:03,019 --> 00:39:05,136
Think hiding at home will help?

264
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,794
I can make one phone call-

265
00:39:08,941 --> 00:39:11,865
and screw more than
you could earn in a year.

266
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:16,763
I wanna go to Amsterdam.

267
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,415
They're so laid-back there.

268
00:39:25,225 --> 00:39:26,772
Think we should go?

269
00:39:31,386 --> 00:39:33,400
We could just lie in the sun.

270
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:42,681
Can we get some drinks over here?

271
00:41:25,694 --> 00:41:28,744
If you want change,
only you can make it happen.

272
00:41:29,935 --> 00:41:32,951
I've tried talking,
but our life just drags on.

273
00:41:34,376 --> 00:41:36,129
I feel so totally alone.

274
00:41:39,177 --> 00:41:41,533
We have to stop
seeing each other.

275
00:41:43,658 --> 00:41:46,014
This is not a solution.
- Why not?

276
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,041
Right.

277
00:43:23,123 --> 00:43:24,579
Pertti.
- Tanja.

278
00:43:25,083 --> 00:43:26,198
Hi.
- Hi.

279
00:43:27,124 --> 00:43:28,239
Your keys.

280
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:33,753
And then... chocolate.
Dark chocolate.

281
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:37,161
Very kind.

282
00:43:38,566 --> 00:43:40,114
What?
- Very kind.

283
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:42,578
It's healthy.

284
00:44:08,254 --> 00:44:09,767
What's that sound?

285
00:44:11,134 --> 00:44:12,853
My mother, she's sick.

286
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:26,168
Could we go to your room?
- Ok.

287
00:45:05,228 --> 00:45:06,946
Want me to talk dirty?

288
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:15,312
First, I lost seven kilos.

289
00:45:16,510 --> 00:45:19,162
But over six months
I gained it all back.

290
00:45:25,152 --> 00:45:27,474
Just one cider, I'll pay you back.

291
00:45:28,553 --> 00:45:30,101
Man, you're stingy.

292
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:39,254
Can you spare a couple of euros?

293
00:45:50,519 --> 00:45:53,443
You look like you can afford
to buy mea beer.

294
00:48:51,403 --> 00:48:53,018
Fucking Russkie fag!

295
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:02,182
What if he was Russian?
- He wasn't.

296
00:49:02,926 --> 00:49:04,917
I told you... Sorry, sorry.

297
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:43,030
Where have you been?

298
00:49:45,856 --> 00:49:48,109
Why are you still up? Got hungry?

299
00:49:51,417 --> 00:49:53,568
Remember, no midnight feasting!

300
00:49:56,499 --> 00:49:58,512
Prowling like a hungry wolf.

301
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,512
Go to bed! And no computer games!

302
00:50:05,941 --> 00:50:07,294
Ok? Good night.

303
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:25,807
If you had three wishes
what would they be?

304
00:50:36,668 --> 00:50:37,533
Come.

305
00:50:54,153 --> 00:50:55,768
You sure about this?

306
00:51:00,314 --> 00:51:01,144
Yes.

307
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,748
You look more grown up.

308
00:51:11,597 --> 00:51:12,916
In a good way.

309
00:51:18,199 --> 00:51:19,552
Or in some way.

310
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,730
You too, in some way.

311
00:51:36,243 --> 00:51:37,562
So here we are.

312
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,108
I have to go.

313
00:52:38,938 --> 00:52:41,658
"I've loved you the most.
Yours, Marika".

314
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,364
Okay.

315
00:52:48,781 --> 00:52:50,100
Greatest love.

316
00:52:53,102 --> 00:52:54,251
First love.

317
00:53:02,824 --> 00:53:04,337
I can't take this.

318
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:09,819
I don't think my wife
would appreciate it.

319
00:53:13,227 --> 00:53:14,945
So, take care.
- Bye.

320
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,340
Bye.

321
00:53:47,315 --> 00:53:50,035
We have to get away from here.
- Where to?

322
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,189
Fucking anywhere.
Hawaii, India, wherever.

323
00:53:56,797 --> 00:54:00,620
We'll just get screwed even worse
if we listen to Ukki's advice.

324
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:01,197
Hey, trust me.

325
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:05,480
Ukki said he'd bring us a solution.

326
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,414
You're fucking unbelievable.

327
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:13,194
Fuck, take this.
I want a fucking divorce.

328
00:54:14,362 --> 00:54:16,512
I've had enough. We're through.

329
00:54:22,003 --> 00:54:24,859
What took you so long?
- I brought a solution.

330
00:54:24,564 --> 00:54:26,077
You brought cider?

331
00:54:27,285 --> 00:54:30,038
Got anything to eat?
My energy level is...

332
00:54:30,806 --> 00:54:34,526
Don't you guys ever clean up here?
- I keep asking that, too.

333
00:54:39,888 --> 00:54:42,402
Merry Christmas.
- Where's the cider?

334
00:54:42,889 --> 00:54:45,608
A Christmas tree is your solution?
- Yes.

335
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:49,033
Here's the solution.
- Santa masks?

336
00:54:53,451 --> 00:54:56,774
You and your fucking solutions.
You can't be serious.

337
00:55:02,453 --> 00:55:04,069
You got an attitude?

338
00:55:06,254 --> 00:55:07,768
Do you understand?

339
00:55:08,135 --> 00:55:11,127
Boys, is everything Ok?
- Just kidding around.

340
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:42,635
I wanted to do a backward flip
on the trampoline.

341
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:46,592
The other kids never let
me play with them.

342
00:56:48,839 --> 00:56:49,989
It's weird.

343
00:56:55,721 --> 00:56:59,044
First you are born,
then you grow into a little girl.

344
00:56:59,282 --> 00:57:00,738
And then you die.

345
00:57:16,406 --> 00:57:19,399
Mom, you went over my angel.
- See, it's here.

346
00:58:54,950 --> 00:58:55,882
Mom...

347
00:59:15,315 --> 00:59:16,930
Your sister is here.

348
00:59:17,956 --> 00:59:19,878
Ok, let's get you dressed.

349
00:59:21,917 --> 00:59:24,272
Could you try cheering up a little?

350
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:31,750
However the tests turn out,
you mustn't lose hope.

351
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,348
Miracles do happen.

352
00:59:56,965 --> 00:59:58,011
Be quiet!

353
01:00:01,526 --> 01:00:02,515
Aleksi!

354
01:00:04,487 --> 01:00:07,912
You have to train Max better.
He's your responsibility.

355
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:08,700
Sorry.

356
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:12,685
The whole building can hear him.
Take him to your room.

357
01:00:12,689 --> 01:00:13,804
Max, come.

358
01:00:16,930 --> 01:00:18,852
How was your day?
- Fine.

359
01:00:23,972 --> 01:00:24,961
Aleksi!

360
01:00:29,013 --> 01:00:30,264
What is this?

361
01:00:31,053 --> 01:00:34,273
Max pooped, I had to clean it up.
- With a dishrag?

362
01:00:35,134 --> 01:00:37,990
You used a fucking dishrag
to clean up poop?

363
01:00:39,776 --> 01:00:43,030
We've got toilet paper,
paper towels, anything else.

364
01:00:43,136 --> 01:00:45,958
I'm supposed to wipe the table
with it now?

365
01:00:45,977 --> 01:00:47,092
Come here.

366
01:00:48,258 --> 01:00:49,680
Pick up the rag.

367
01:00:51,258 --> 01:00:52,772
Take it! Smell it!

368
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,494
I'm supposed to hold this
in my hand?

369
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,747
Smell it!

370
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:03,460
Smell the rag!

371
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,584
You know what it is? Shit!

372
01:01:09,263 --> 01:01:10,252
Damnit!

373
01:01:11,423 --> 01:01:15,178
You're 7 years old. You should
be able to handle responsibility.

374
01:01:19,825 --> 01:01:20,872
Good dog.

375
01:01:31,148 --> 01:01:32,969
Oh, my.
Now, watch out.

376
01:01:34,149 --> 01:01:35,298
Help! Look!

377
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:39,940
What if it falls?
- You ready?

378
01:01:41,991 --> 01:01:44,141
One... Hopla!
- One more time.

379
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:52,672
There you are.

380
01:02:09,197 --> 01:02:10,449
We want more!

381
01:02:37,244 --> 01:02:39,793
How can it be like this?
- Then don't.

382
01:03:13,693 --> 01:03:16,515
I'll just finish this.
- You've had enough.

383
01:03:16,174 --> 01:03:18,222
I'll finish this and go home.

384
01:03:24,056 --> 01:03:25,603
You'll never guess-

385
01:03:26,616 --> 01:03:30,269
but the world's sweetest
photographer asked me out on a date.

386
01:03:34,858 --> 01:03:36,474
That's not erotic...

387
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:38,276
That's nice.

388
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:44,692
What if he doesn't show up?

389
01:03:45,541 --> 01:03:47,759
You'd hold your penis like that?

390
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:51,557
I mean, do you think he could
actually like me?

391
01:03:52,983 --> 01:03:55,133
There's nothing wrong with you.

392
01:03:58,104 --> 01:03:59,651
You're a great girl.

393
01:04:44,275 --> 01:04:45,789
Holy shit, Pertti!

394
01:04:50,637 --> 01:04:52,559
What a man! Do that zumba!

395
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:02,329
I wanna sing karaoke.

396
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,595
Feel it...

397
01:05:11,562 --> 01:05:12,984
Let go, asshole.

398
01:05:53,812 --> 01:05:54,801
Shit...

399
01:06:13,177 --> 01:06:15,829
Now I know why I'm
not losing any weight-

400
01:06:16,058 --> 01:06:18,982
even though I've been
working out like crazy.

401
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:22,050
It must be water retention.

402
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:26,773
Pertti.
- Yes?

403
01:06:28,621 --> 01:06:30,634
Is this really your problem?

404
01:06:33,862 --> 01:06:37,720
I worry about my son, Teemu.
How he'll cope in this harsh world.

405
01:06:40,464 --> 01:06:42,386
Women want men to be tough.

406
01:06:43,744 --> 01:06:47,499
They don't like softies. I don't
want him to inherit my belly.

407
01:06:55,507 --> 01:06:56,623
Max, heel!

408
01:07:03,189 --> 01:07:04,019
Max!

409
01:07:10,671 --> 01:07:12,024
Max, come back!

410
01:07:33,557 --> 01:07:36,549
Why was Max waiting
outside the building alone?

411
01:07:38,198 --> 01:07:41,053
You can't leave him alone
and just walk off.

412
01:07:40,918 --> 01:07:42,238
What happened?

413
01:07:42,919 --> 01:07:46,777
Max is your responsibility.
Don't start acting like your father.

414
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:48,286
Take Max.

415
01:07:52,121 --> 01:07:53,167
Good dog.

416
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:25,139
Hi.
- Hi.

417
01:09:26,104 --> 01:09:27,526
Is my taxi here?

418
01:09:35,026 --> 01:09:36,779
If you've got the time-

419
01:09:38,787 --> 01:09:41,712
you could empty the ashes
from the fireplace.

420
01:09:43,108 --> 01:09:44,325
Ok.
- Good.

421
01:11:43,457 --> 01:11:45,278
It looks pretty serious.

422
01:12:26,148 --> 01:12:28,902
Mommy, do you have
the devil in your head?

423
01:12:48,993 --> 01:12:50,507
I'm going.
- Bye.

424
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,110
I have some interesting guests.

425
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,526
As long as your philosophy is
that you're willing to do anything-

426
01:13:22,762 --> 01:13:24,810
you'll wind up in situations.

427
01:13:26,403 --> 01:13:28,155
What kind of situations?

428
01:13:28,683 --> 01:13:31,198
The kind where publicity
is on offer.

429
01:13:33,964 --> 01:13:35,512
But at a high cost.

430
01:13:36,805 --> 01:13:38,956
Isn't that what you want, fame?

431
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,816
Publicity, expressly?

432
01:13:45,327 --> 01:13:47,751
It's always been your dream?
- Yes.

433
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:52,277
What are we going to do?
- You'll see.

434
01:14:12,174 --> 01:14:14,927
Sure you're willing to do anything?
- Yes.

435
01:14:16,815 --> 01:14:19,865
And you've really thought
about what that means?

436
01:14:28,858 --> 01:14:30,906
Rebecca has an offer for you.

437
01:14:33,179 --> 01:14:36,604
If I were you, I'd think
carefully before taking it up.

438
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:40,756
You brought me here.
- But it's your choice.

439
01:15:11,388 --> 01:15:13,641
One should try everything, right?

440
01:15:29,553 --> 01:15:31,066
Can we trust them?

441
01:15:34,194 --> 01:15:37,210
You can always trust a sailor.
And the Chinese.

442
01:15:38,915 --> 01:15:40,564
It'll never work out.

443
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:43,072
You know what your problem is?

444
01:15:42,756 --> 01:15:45,270
You talk too much.
I'm not buying it.

445
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:47,772
Show some respect!
I'm doing this for Makke.

446
01:15:47,917 --> 01:15:50,569
You've screwed up your brain
with drugs.

447
01:15:52,198 --> 01:15:55,418
Tell me, where's your woman?
Never seen her around.

448
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:58,419
Bet you don't get much pussy
with a face like that.

449
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,592
Your life's over. Done.

450
01:16:02,561 --> 01:16:06,077
You're fucking jealous.
- I'll be glad to get rid of you.

451
01:16:07,162 --> 01:16:10,485
You're a blood sucker,
living in my mother's apartment.

452
01:16:12,003 --> 01:16:14,723
You can't even get laid.
- Welfare case...

453
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:17,248
Your problem is that
you're so fucking lonely.

454
01:16:16,404 --> 01:16:19,829
If you don't shut your mouth,
I'll stick my dick in it.

455
01:16:20,125 --> 01:16:23,243
Your tiny shrimp in my
mouth is not gonna happen.

456
01:16:25,726 --> 01:16:27,149
Pathetic wanker!

457
01:16:28,887 --> 01:16:30,503
God, I need a cider!

458
01:16:32,928 --> 01:16:35,978
Don't we have anything to eat?
Jesus, it stinks.

459
01:16:37,049 --> 01:16:40,201
You're just an old alkie.
- So you give us a plan!

460
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,385
Here's a plan! I'll jump.

461
01:16:44,491 --> 01:16:46,539
You want me to jump?
Do you?

462
01:16:47,772 --> 01:16:49,888
Makke, do you want me to jump?

463
01:16:50,172 --> 01:16:51,720
Getaway from there.

464
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,585
What would you do if you were me?

465
01:17:12,418 --> 01:17:13,180
Hi.

466
01:17:32,783 --> 01:17:35,035
I just need a little more time...

467
01:17:36,184 --> 01:17:38,607
I had it for you,
I had the money...

468
01:17:44,346 --> 01:17:45,961
I'll take care of it.

469
01:17:57,629 --> 01:17:58,880
Payback time.

470
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:03,516
I know...

471
01:18:11,992 --> 01:18:12,925
Don't!

472
01:18:32,797 --> 01:18:35,221
Can't we settle this some other way?

473
01:18:59,044 --> 01:19:00,159
Come on...

474
01:19:06,246 --> 01:19:07,497
I said I'd...

475
01:19:53,897 --> 01:19:57,356
He was covered in vomit and feces,
so we had to bag him.

476
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:03,234
You shouldn't buy cider
for an underage boy.

477
01:20:09,301 --> 01:20:10,233
Mom...

478
01:20:13,262 --> 01:20:14,877
Will you be Ok here?

479
01:20:23,584 --> 01:20:25,132
Hold your hands up.

480
01:20:27,105 --> 01:20:28,037
Mom...

481
01:20:30,226 --> 01:20:33,583
Let's turn you sideways,
in case you need to throw up.

482
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:43,126
Mom...
- Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

483
01:21:56,487 --> 01:21:59,742
Come and see who gets
voted out next. How did it go?

484
01:22:03,289 --> 01:22:04,802
Fine... I'm tired.

485
01:22:06,810 --> 01:22:08,528
Want something to eat?

486
01:22:57,942 --> 01:22:58,988
Let's go.

487
01:23:01,503 --> 01:23:02,652
To the car.

488
01:23:16,307 --> 01:23:18,355
You have to get used to this.

489
01:23:21,508 --> 01:23:24,558
You have to get used to this,
if I'm not around.

490
01:23:38,872 --> 01:23:41,421
Mommy, why can't I
go stay with Daddy?

491
01:23:50,875 --> 01:23:52,695
I want to be a princess.

492
01:23:53,356 --> 01:23:55,972
When I get married,
I'll never unmarry.

493
01:24:03,798 --> 01:24:07,451
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
how I wonder where you are...

494
01:24:20,402 --> 01:24:21,755
Sing some more.

495
01:24:22,803 --> 01:24:26,228
The judges haven't decided
whether you get to continue.

496
01:25:02,012 --> 01:25:03,025
Russkie!

497
01:25:53,625 --> 01:25:54,557
There.

498
01:25:56,065 --> 01:25:57,112
Aleksi...

499
01:26:00,026 --> 01:26:03,144
I've thinking about our situation,
or I mean Max.

500
01:26:07,468 --> 01:26:11,121
I just feel this apartment's a bit
small for such a fine dog.

501
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:14,965
Max needs more space.

502
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,913
Freedom to run, fresh air.

503
01:26:19,831 --> 01:26:21,948
I know you love him very much-

504
01:26:23,392 --> 01:26:26,851
but I really feel we should
send him back to the country.

505
01:26:43,037 --> 01:26:44,857
Sorry. This is my fault.

506
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:56,864
Don't worry. You'll have lots
of friends in the country.

507
01:28:36,945 --> 01:28:38,458
This is a robbery!

508
01:28:39,065 --> 01:28:40,920
Keep your hands in sight!

509
01:28:41,306 --> 01:28:43,524
Lie down!
All of you, lie down!

510
01:28:45,427 --> 01:28:47,076
Get up!
- Head down!

511
01:28:50,788 --> 01:28:52,837
Put it in there.
Don't move!

512
01:29:03,231 --> 01:29:04,220
Faster!

513
01:29:10,353 --> 01:29:12,002
Head down!
Lied own!

514
01:29:14,434 --> 01:29:17,051
Now, sing a Christmas song,
all of you!

515
01:29:18,235 --> 01:29:19,486
All together.

516
01:29:24,396 --> 01:29:26,046
Found the good stuff!

517
01:29:31,438 --> 01:29:32,951
You got the money?

518
01:29:34,399 --> 01:29:35,445
Let's go!

519
01:30:20,570 --> 01:30:21,434
Shit!

520
01:30:42,335 --> 01:30:43,098
Hi.

521
01:30:45,576 --> 01:30:46,793
What a trip.

522
01:30:55,939 --> 01:30:56,803
What?

523
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:04,762
Where are the kids?
- Staying at Grandma's.

524
01:31:07,581 --> 01:31:09,698
We have a guest coming.
- Oh?

525
01:31:11,702 --> 01:31:12,567
Okay.

526
01:31:22,065 --> 01:31:23,783
Is it like a surprise?

527
01:31:28,347 --> 01:31:29,279
Maybe.

528
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,417
That suits you...

529
01:32:40,084 --> 01:32:41,233
Aha.
- Hi.

530
01:32:44,805 --> 01:32:46,057
What is this?

531
01:32:49,446 --> 01:32:51,165
You know Viivi, right?

532
01:32:56,368 --> 01:32:59,588
I thought we'd have a drink
together before we eat.

533
01:33:02,049 --> 01:33:02,880
Yes.

534
01:33:05,250 --> 01:33:08,675
I bought that excellent
sparkling wine. We had it once.

535
01:33:10,011 --> 01:33:12,025
Where was it again? In Rome?

536
01:33:13,652 --> 01:33:16,474
Will you have some with us?
Sparkling wine?

537
01:33:17,973 --> 01:33:19,896
White wine? I'll get some.

538
01:33:21,694 --> 01:33:23,413
Make yourself at home.

539
01:33:34,017 --> 01:33:36,270
Truth or dare?
You get to choose.

540
01:33:40,219 --> 01:33:41,572
Viivi.
- What?

541
01:33:42,739 --> 01:33:44,560
Truth or dare.
- Truth.

542
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,552
Truth.

543
01:33:48,741 --> 01:33:49,730
Well...

544
01:34:02,624 --> 01:34:05,480
That dissertation of yours,
what's it about?

545
01:34:09,866 --> 01:34:12,084
It's about social networks and...

546
01:34:14,307 --> 01:34:16,560
Their building...
- Development.

547
01:34:17,868 --> 01:34:20,918
Development. The development
of social networks.

548
01:34:21,109 --> 01:34:23,031
Ok, so that's what you do.

549
01:34:25,390 --> 01:34:27,381
And you do it with Lauri...

550
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:32,375
We've talked about it sometimes.
- What else do you do?

551
01:34:34,512 --> 01:34:37,334
I do research on media
and group behaviour.

552
01:34:43,434 --> 01:34:45,483
She is one intelligent woman!

553
01:34:47,435 --> 01:34:50,451
How people behave in groups,
like on realityTV.

554
01:34:53,877 --> 01:34:56,926
How come you suddenly don't
understand anything?

555
01:34:57,398 --> 01:35:01,050
I'm trying. I'm trying to
understand what this is all about.

556
01:35:01,799 --> 01:35:05,053
That's the whole point.
- It can't be all that hard.

557
01:35:05,079 --> 01:35:08,129
It's like group behaviour,
in a miniature world.

558
01:35:09,000 --> 01:35:11,253
Like our family here, for example.

559
01:35:12,201 --> 01:35:14,124
Our home. I do understand.

560
01:35:18,763 --> 01:35:20,276
More wine, anyone?

561
01:35:23,044 --> 01:35:25,900
Viivi probably wants some. A lot.
I presume.

562
01:35:29,845 --> 01:35:32,360
Since you have
a sexual relationship.

563
01:35:40,168 --> 01:35:43,525
But Viivi, if you take money
and then fuck that bastard-

564
01:35:43,969 --> 01:35:45,982
it makes you a whore.
- No.

565
01:35:51,211 --> 01:35:53,930
How's that?
- Seems I'm in love with him.

566
01:36:02,733 --> 01:36:03,746
But why.

567
01:36:08,735 --> 01:36:10,726
Can he fuck you up the ass?

568
01:36:15,297 --> 01:36:16,127
Yes.

569
01:36:18,777 --> 01:36:22,532
Listen, Viivi. I haven't wanted to
have sex with him in years.

570
01:36:23,459 --> 01:36:26,110
It's awful, but I'm
just not interested.

571
01:36:26,779 --> 01:36:29,931
But aren't these... habits
like a personal matter?

572
01:36:38,102 --> 01:36:39,148
Yes. Yes.

573
01:36:41,823 --> 01:36:44,679
But in this case it kind of
concerns me too-

574
01:36:45,024 --> 01:36:47,140
since that prick is my husband.

575
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:49,842
You said it.

576
01:36:52,066 --> 01:36:55,888
But can you really own somebody?
- Listen, Viivi. We need to...

577
01:36:56,267 --> 01:36:59,486
We're married and have kids,
there's a system, see.

578
01:37:03,188 --> 01:37:07,205
I have so much going on right now,
I don't have time for a divorce.

579
01:37:10,590 --> 01:37:12,410
For fuck's sake.
- What?

580
01:37:12,711 --> 01:37:13,723
Come on.

581
01:37:15,151 --> 01:37:17,803
It would be nice to know
how Viivi comes.

582
01:37:18,512 --> 01:37:21,664
Or is the word 'come'
just for men? Do women come?

583
01:37:21,233 --> 01:37:24,452
I wouldn't know, it's been so
long since I had sex.

584
01:37:26,034 --> 01:37:28,650
Are you going to
keep this up for long?

585
01:37:28,474 --> 01:37:31,524
No, I'm just thinking,
about our common history.

586
01:37:32,195 --> 01:37:34,619
Our sexual history.
Which is short.

587
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:39,712
And you've always blamed me for it.

588
01:38:02,603 --> 01:38:05,026
Ok, let's drink and go to the sauna.

589
01:38:05,884 --> 01:38:08,432
We'll go to the sauna, right?
- Right.

590
01:38:08,844 --> 01:38:10,563
To the sauna.
- Fine.

591
01:38:26,729 --> 01:38:28,082
I just can't...

592
01:38:37,131 --> 01:38:38,884
Wow, that's super cool.

593
01:38:41,492 --> 01:38:44,917
Have you... Of course you've
seen it, how stupid of me.

594
01:39:03,578 --> 01:39:05,398
I'm leaving.
- Your fee.

595
01:39:08,339 --> 01:39:11,331
No, thank you.
- Come on, it's tax deductible.

596
01:39:26,263 --> 01:39:27,093
Bye.

597
01:39:48,309 --> 01:39:49,662
The last two...

598
01:39:51,509 --> 01:39:53,125
What happened to us?

599
01:39:59,911 --> 01:40:01,368
What do you want?

600
01:40:03,552 --> 01:40:06,306
Is it just because you're
not getting sex?

601
01:40:07,033 --> 01:40:08,250
I loved you.

602
01:40:11,314 --> 01:40:13,306
I've done everything I can.

603
01:40:20,516 --> 01:40:23,771
Just go! I won't let you
blackmail me with the kids.

604
01:40:44,082 --> 01:40:47,507
You're so damned selfish,
you're destroying our family.

605
01:40:47,243 --> 01:40:48,790
So fucking selfish!

606
01:40:50,244 --> 01:40:51,290
Fuck off!

607
01:40:52,844 --> 01:40:53,960
We can go.

608
01:40:56,005 --> 01:40:57,154
I hate you!

609
01:41:00,526 --> 01:41:02,347
You destroyed my family!

610
01:41:14,209 --> 01:41:15,359
Good going!

611
01:41:17,290 --> 01:41:20,112
Should we go all the way?
- It's too steep.

612
01:41:20,291 --> 01:41:23,216
We won't make it all the way.
- Sure we will.

613
01:41:32,374 --> 01:41:35,526
I want to apologize to you,
I've been a total mess.

614
01:41:44,097 --> 01:41:46,713
Why isn't my belly getting
any smaller?

615
01:41:48,578 --> 01:41:51,798
Or maybe it has, just a little.
- It has, a little.

616
01:41:51,859 --> 01:41:53,713
All this is firm, here...

617
01:42:02,581 --> 01:42:04,004
Your belly's Ok.

618
01:42:08,583 --> 01:42:10,403
Your mom didn't like it.

619
01:42:15,985 --> 01:42:18,636
It can't have been just
about the belly.

620
01:42:27,827 --> 01:42:29,682
We have to face the fact-

621
01:42:32,309 --> 01:42:34,459
there's just the two of us now.

622
01:42:35,269 --> 01:42:37,283
I know.
- Throw some water.

623
01:42:54,114 --> 01:42:56,469
You get to make a wish.
Blow on it.

624
01:43:01,076 --> 01:43:03,499
Did you make a wish?
Ah, don't tell.

625
01:43:08,077 --> 01:43:10,399
Where is she?
She's an hour late.

626
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:18,439
Just go alone.

627
01:43:21,801 --> 01:43:23,450
Women always survive.

628
01:43:26,082 --> 01:43:28,095
I'm married.
- Yeah, right.

629
01:43:30,563 --> 01:43:32,679
She'll find someone new and...

630
01:43:42,366 --> 01:43:43,822
She's not coming.

631
01:43:49,727 --> 01:43:51,047
We have to go.

632
01:43:54,088 --> 01:43:55,636
The ship won't wait.

633
01:44:34,538 --> 01:44:35,403
Stop!

634
01:44:41,300 --> 01:44:44,520
Take your fucking hands off!
I'm freezing to death!

635
01:44:45,101 --> 01:44:46,557
And take the bag.

636
01:44:47,221 --> 01:44:50,339
I'm really pissed off.
I've been waiting forever.

637
01:44:50,382 --> 01:44:54,001
You got, like, tickets for us?
What's that bag doing there?

638
01:44:57,224 --> 01:44:58,873
I'm fucking freezing!

639
01:45:39,114 --> 01:45:40,229
Don't run.

640
01:45:47,676 --> 01:45:48,893
Thanks, Dad.

641
01:45:52,037 --> 01:45:53,187
No problem.

642
01:45:56,038 --> 01:45:57,495
Sure you'll be Ok?

643
01:46:15,683 --> 01:46:18,539
Where's the ship headed?
What do we do next?

644
01:46:20,044 --> 01:46:22,866
Ukki arranged it all.
- Ok, I'll calm down.

645
01:46:25,405 --> 01:46:27,727
Know what?
This is our honeymoon.

646
01:46:30,167 --> 01:46:32,317
I fucking hope they have cider.

647
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:37,249
And hey, we'll never get divorced.

648
01:46:38,008 --> 01:46:41,228
If I don't get some cider
I won't be able to swallow.

649
01:46:49,451 --> 01:46:50,999
Put Max in the car.

650
01:46:59,734 --> 01:47:00,951
Max, be good.

651
01:47:02,694 --> 01:47:05,744
Don't bark on the way over,
or Mom will get mad.

652
01:47:06,655 --> 01:47:08,078
Don't forget me.

653
01:47:09,976 --> 01:47:12,696
I love you.
- Aleksi, get out of the way.

654
01:47:17,338 --> 01:47:20,092
Go to bed early,
I won't be in until late.

655
01:47:21,259 --> 01:47:22,271
Big boy.

656
01:47:53,107 --> 01:47:55,962
Max looked so happy out there
in the country.

657
01:47:56,468 --> 01:47:59,084
You don't have to be worried.
- I'm not.

658
01:48:09,631 --> 01:48:12,145
How about we go buy some candy?
- No.

659
01:48:15,912 --> 01:48:19,030
I thought you liked the coloured ones?
- I don't.

660
01:48:21,794 --> 01:48:24,912
They may have some of
those black ones this time.

661
01:48:24,795 --> 01:48:27,252
Hey, how about some ice-cream?
- Ok.

662
01:48:28,956 --> 01:48:30,810
Chocolate flavour for me.

663
01:48:45,240 --> 01:48:46,559
For you, goat.

664
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:13,225
We're not going to
continue your treatment...

665
01:50:51,630 --> 01:50:53,553
You can do anything to me.

666
01:51:21,758 --> 01:51:23,771
The dog was so much trouble.

667
01:51:24,758 --> 01:51:26,807
You did what?
- I killed it.

668
01:51:29,560 --> 01:51:31,676
Had it put down.
I killed it.

669
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:35,834
How did you do it?
- Keep your voice down.

670
01:51:38,122 --> 01:51:40,977
It was so much trouble,
just a heap of shit.

671
01:51:44,283 --> 01:51:46,900
You should have made
mittens out of it.

672
01:52:15,371 --> 01:52:18,830
They're looking for singers for
a new show. Did you see?

673
01:52:23,133 --> 01:52:24,885
You're good at singing.

674
01:52:28,894 --> 01:52:31,409
I'm not interested, Dad,
Not anymore.

675
01:52:34,735 --> 01:52:35,498
Oh?

676
01:52:43,898 --> 01:52:45,889
I just want to be ordinary.

677
01:52:58,341 --> 01:52:59,273
Viivi?

678
01:53:03,182 --> 01:53:06,801
I don't think I'll ever be able
to handle a new relationship.

679
01:53:12,105 --> 01:53:13,857
Let's just be here now.

680
01:53:40,792 --> 01:53:41,724
Mommy?

681
01:53:43,872 --> 01:53:46,524
Will Daddy come back
when you're better?

682
01:53:49,074 --> 01:53:50,826
We can manage like this.

683
01:53:57,436 --> 01:53:59,290
I have something for you.

684
01:54:09,119 --> 01:54:10,541
I don't want it.

685
01:54:32,244 --> 01:54:34,861
Hurry up or you'll be
late from school.

686
01:54:36,125 --> 01:54:38,583
I have to be somewhere too.
- Where?

687
01:54:39,286 --> 01:54:41,641
Job centre.
I have an appointment.

688
01:54:42,447 --> 01:54:45,063
Oh, by the way.
I broke up with Antero.

689
01:54:52,769 --> 01:54:54,886
Good. He was a fucking walrus.

690
01:55:29,818 --> 01:55:32,242
You can't get
dressed here, faggot!

691
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:34,753
Get the hell out of here!

692
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:38,482
Did you hear me?

693
01:55:41,021 --> 01:55:42,568
You didn't hear me?

694
01:55:45,782 --> 01:55:47,705
Just go into the corridor.

695
01:55:48,623 --> 01:55:50,045
Did you hear me?

696
01:55:53,184 --> 01:55:54,503
What the fuck?

697
01:56:00,226 --> 01:56:01,978
You still want to spit?

698
01:56:06,427 --> 01:56:07,416
Do you?

699
01:56:17,830 --> 01:56:19,445
You're going to die.

700
01:57:12,483 --> 01:57:13,599
Hi.
- Hi.

701
01:57:18,405 --> 01:57:20,418
Wanna come and sing?
- Now?

702
01:57:22,246 --> 01:57:23,793
Now is a good time.

703
02:03:23,894 --> 02:03:25,816
