1
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,560
- Is he here yet?
- No.

2
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,830
- You scared him.
- I gotta take a massive piss.

3
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,600
Dude, any excuse for you
to pull that thing out.

4
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,860
Anyone got any beer?

5
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,090
We finished them all back at school.
Besides, you've had enough.

6
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,170
I've got one. It's not cold,
but it's yours if you want it.

7
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,810
All you gotta do is sit up, beg,
roll over and shake that booty.

8
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:47,670
- Thanks a lot, Eric.
- Anytime, anywhere.

9
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,820
- This is gonna be sweet.
- I'm glad I thought of it.

10
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,580
You're animals.
Just because he's new.

11
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,620
You've talked shit the whole time.
Why don't you be quiet?

12
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,020
You know how it is.
Nobody's forcing him to show up.

13
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,760
What if he doesn't?
I want to go back to the dance.

14
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,130
Belinda, why don't you go back
to the dance by yourself?

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,530
I wasn't talking to you, Dean.

16
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,640
You know I don't dance.

17
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,510
It's true. I've seen him bust a move.
It ain't pretty.

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:26,010
But a brother like me is ready
to get his freak on. What you say?

19
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,580
Put it away before you hurt somebody.

20
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,190
Like yourself.

21
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,650
He's here!

22
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,450
All right, here he comes.

23
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,620
Hey, check out the Safari Joe truck.

24
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,200
I can't wait to see you fly!

25
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,730
Hey, nice shirt, Opie.

26
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,040
You're late.

27
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,910
I thought I said be here at 10,
but you know...

28
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,020
When I say be here at 10, be here.
Can you remember that next time?

29
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:10,960
If there is a next time!

30
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,630
Dean! Is he always like that?

31
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,790
Always, man. So how about it?
You ready to fly?

32
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:23,530
Wait up, baby!

33
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,850
Let me get on your back.
Giddyap! Giddyap!

34
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,370
Okay, here's the deal.

35
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,170
You're gonna jump
from up there into here.

36
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,970
That's it, and you're one of us. Okay?

37
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,410
- You ready?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,380
All right. All right.

39
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,150
Let's do this, okay?

40
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,630
It's cake, man.
Hell, I'm jumping with you.

41
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,790
- How deep is this?
- I don't really know.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,560
Let's go find out.

43
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,470
Let's do it.

44
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,070
Yeah! Shit, yeah!

45
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,700
Come on, let's go!

46
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:07,370
Jump!

47
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,910
- You done this?
- We've all done it.

48
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,250
- I hope you had your Wheaties!
- You guys gonna do this tonight?

49
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,360
On three.

50
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,580
One.

51
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,490
Two.

52
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,960
Three!

53
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,910
Oh, shit.

54
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,480
Landon, he's hurt!

55
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,980
- Is he okay?
- Landon, get down here!

56
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,450
- What the hell?
- Dean, what the hell?

57
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:55,020
- You guys, he's hurt!
- Come on, man!

58
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,690
- I told you it was a bad idea!
- Get him out of the water!

59
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:05,030
- Hurry up!
- Is he dead? What are we gonna do?

60
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,660
Help me!

61
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,070
- Get him over here!
- There's a pipe. He must have hit it!

62
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,350
Get him out of the water!

63
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,280
Watch his head! Watch his head!

64
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,850
Hey, who's down there?

65
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,320
Tracie, come on!

66
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,230
Central, we've got trespassers.
Send a squad car.

67
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,420
Come on, Landon.

68
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,200
Come on!

69
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,430
You guys, just take him!

70
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,630
Give me his arms!

71
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,710
I got him.

72
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,510
We gotta get out of here.

73
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,450
- Go! Get out of here!
- Landon, come on!

74
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,320
I told you not to do this!

75
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,050
Calm down.

76
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,330
Belinda, let's go!

77
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:10,930
Come on, get in! I'm driving.

78
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,460
Damn it!

79
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,780
Shit!

80
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,310
Put your hands on the wheel.

81
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,940
You know, Mama,
my leg really hurts today.

82
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,840
I don't think I can go any place.

83
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,080
- Maybe I should call your father.
- No.

84
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:12,550
I'm not talking to him.

85
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:18,460
This has gotta stop between you two.
You can't do that. You need a father.

86
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,060
Let us be thankful today
that a life was saved by our Lord.

87
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,610
And let us pray for the lives
of the others involved...

88
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,640
...who are clearly not
on the path of righteousness.

89
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:16,170
- So how's the leg, man?
- It's good.

90
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,580
I can't believe you were in jail.

91
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,340
- What'd you tell them?
- It was a nice night for a drive.

92
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,960
Ended up at the cement factory,
found Gephardt.

93
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,290
Tried to help him, got spooked.

94
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,950
Figured I'd leave before
they thought I was involved.

95
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,500
Gotta hand it to you.
You're a Jedi Master of bullshit.

96
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,000
Damn, that Jamie Sullivan
sure has style.

97
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,500
Wore that dress in the fourth grade.

98
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:45,270
It's the quiet ones you gotta watch.

99
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,470
She might put it on a brother
like a Pop-Tart.

100
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,210
A little maintenance,
she might not look bad.

101
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,180
Nice sweater.

102
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:56,250
Thank you.

103
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,390
Thank you.

104
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,310
A student claims you were drinking
on school property.

105
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,180
Lucky for you,
Clay Gephardt isn't talking.

106
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:30,340
The factory owners aren't pressing
charges. At least not today.

107
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,420
I said I'd arrange
appropriate punishment.

108
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,620
What, are you gonna expel me?

109
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,560
Not yet.

110
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,060
Besides attending class, you will help
our janitorial staff after school.

111
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:47,730
- For pay?
- For the inner satisfaction it brings.

112
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,370
Saturdays, you'll tutor students
at our sister school.

113
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,840
You'll take part
in the drama club's final event.

114
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,350
The spring play?

115
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,420
It's time you experienced
other things.

116
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,520
Started spending time
with other kinds of people.

117
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,850
Don't blow it, Landon.

118
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:20,060
This is a device made of plastic wrap,
a coat hanger and Wite-Out.

119
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:24,070
- Does anyone know what it is?
- It's a star frame.

120
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,110
This is a star frame.

121
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,610
It will help you locate stars
with your naked eye.

122
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,720
Mercury and Jupiter can be seen just
over the west horizon after sunset.

123
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,450
Bet you can see angels up there,
flying around.

124
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:45,490
There are things that
could be called miraculous.

125
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,360
The more Einstein studied the universe,
the more he believed in a higher power.

126
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,860
Well, if there is a higher power...

127
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,670
...why can't he get you a new sweater?

128
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,540
He's too busy looking for your brain.

129
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,880
Laugh, it's a joke.

130
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,810
- Let's get out of here.
- I gotta stay.

131
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,250
Principal's gone.
Let's make some moves.

132
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,550
Come on. Come on.

133
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,390
I don't know.
The custodian thing kind of suits you.

134
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,650
Thanks, buddy. Thank you.

135
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,200
Look at the chart,
you'll see Halley's comet.

136
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,570
Okay, so I'll see you at school.

137
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,010
My parents aren't home,
if you want to come inside.

138
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,550
Come on, Belinda. Nothing's changed.

139
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,810
I know. I just thought...

140
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,580
It's over.

141
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,690
Yeah. Whatever.

142
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,900
Okay.

143
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,010
Good morning, Landon.

144
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,780
Landon, wake up!

145
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,820
Come on. Up, up, up, up!

146
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,550
Up!

147
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,660
It's Saturday, no school.

148
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,730
Tutoring.

149
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,440
Let's try this again.

150
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,950
Which of these are similar triangles?
This one or that one?

151
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,150
What do you think?

152
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,220
Man, I think this is bullshit!

153
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,730
Makes two of us.

154
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:25,780
Do you wanna buy some raffle tickets?

155
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,020
I'm trying to raise money
to buy Jefferson new computers.

156
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,990
No.

157
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:37,730
So I saw you in there with Luis.

158
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,530
And I know it can be difficult...

159
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:44,330
...but maybe you should back
into it from somewhere else.

160
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,080
Are you gonna go visit Clay Gephardt?

161
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,550
That would be a no.

162
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,320
They moved him from the hospital
to a rehab place.

163
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,430
Is this your idea of small talk?

164
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:09,400
If so, your social skills need work.
No one made him jump.

165
00:17:09,630 --> 00:17:12,400
- It's called peer pressure.
- How do you know?

166
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,870
You read it in your precious book?

167
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,940
Please don't pretend
like you know me, okay?

168
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:26,080
But I do. I do.

169
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,580
We have all the same classes
since kindergarten.

170
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:33,620
Why, you're Jamie Sullivan.
You sit at lunch table seven.

171
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:38,590
It's not the reject table, but it's
definitely self-exile territory.

172
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,390
You have exactly one sweater.
You look at your feet when you walk.

173
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,130
And for fun, you tutor on weekends...

174
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,030
...and hang out
with the Stars and Planets kids.

175
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,800
How's that sound?

176
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,780
Fairly predictable.
Nothing I haven't heard before.

177
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:01,210
- You don't care what people think?
- No.

178
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,950
I don't know what your problem is.
Miss Garber has nice hooters.

179
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:37,780
This is bullshit. Thanks.

180
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:42,190
I can't wait to see you in stage
makeup. That's gonna be cool.

181
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,160
- Be back in an hour.
- Tell them to do West Side Story.

182
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,500
Get that nice big-booty girl
from Selena. Maria! Maria!

183
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,840
This year's spring musical is about
fiery passion and blazing Tommy guns.

184
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:03,340
Written by our own Eddie Zimmerhoff.
Words and music by Jamie Sullivan.

185
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:09,140
It tells the story of Tommy "The Gun"
Thornton in Prohibition-era New York.

186
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,790
Eddie, perhaps-

187
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:14,550
Mr. Carter, better late than never.
Please join us.

188
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,520
Sure.

189
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,890
Now then, let's see...

190
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,830
Jamie will be our Alicia,
a mysterious club singer.

191
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:31,070
- Sally will be playing Caroline.
- Congratulations.

192
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,440
And Landon will read Tommy Thornton.

193
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:40,410
No. No. See, I didn't plan
on acting or anything.

194
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,110
When did you know, Tommy?

195
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,750
IKnow what?

196
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,320
That we were in love.

197
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,830
Love?

198
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,060
Baby, you don't want to fall
in love with a guy like me.

199
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,930
It's too late. I'm crazy about you.

200
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:05,740
I'm breathing it, drinking it all in.
Aren't you?

201
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:13,210
I don't know what I'm drinking,
dollface, but if this is love...

202
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,580
...pour me another glass.

203
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:18,550
Are you trying to be bad at this?

204
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,920
No, just comes naturally.

205
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,160
All right, everybody,
let's go to the end.

206
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,440
Don't even pretend you won't be great.

207
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,540
- Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. See you.

208
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,340
Bye.

209
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:55,390
- So would it kill you to try?
- Yep, and I'm too young to die.

210
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,760
You don't care about classes,
but you like school...

211
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,690
...because you're popular
and you'll never be on top again.

212
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,240
- That's thoroughly predictable.
- Your act only works on an audience.

213
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,940
Feeling Christian?

214
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,830
Seat belt?

215
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,330
- I forfeit.
- Thank you.

216
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:10,800
Forty-two.

217
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,130
What do you mean, forty-two?

218
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,500
Forty-two is befriend somebody
I don't like.

219
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,740
It's a to-do list I have for my life.

220
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,970
Like getting a new personality?

221
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,150
Join the Peace Corps,
make a medical discovery.

222
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:28,340
Ambitious.

223
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:32,250
Be in two places at once,
get a tattoo.

224
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:36,020
What's number one?

225
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,790
I'd tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

226
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,810
I've come...

227
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,380
...to see if you're ready.

228
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,520
Take a good look. The only thing
I'm ready for is a dirt nap.

229
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,550
Ready to look into your heart,
Tom Thornton.

230
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,890
Your words have been heard,
and not just by me.

231
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,890
When you walked into...

232
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:20,830
Shit. When you walked into my club,
that wasn't just a coincidence.

233
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,130
Nothing's coincidence, baby.

234
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,970
You know you're the only one
who can make me sing.

235
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,550
Yeah, Miss Garber!
You'll put Eric in all your plays!

236
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,410
Eric, I'll put you in all my plays!

237
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,590
Come on. Do you know I got
three weeks to memorize all this?

238
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:42,280
You couldn't pull this off
in three months! De Niro couldn't!

239
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,090
I didn't write it, okay?

240
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,890
But you're gonna make a jackass
of yourself in front of everyone.

241
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,500
Look, I don't have a choice,
so would you help me out, please?

242
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,730
I'm just busting on you.

243
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,070
I'll be there opening night,
front row. And you can count on it.

244
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,610
With tomatoes.

245
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,810
Thanks, man.

246
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:11,750
Landon? Boys, can you help
with these groceries?

247
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,920
- Yeah.
- No problem.

248
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:24,300
Jamie.

249
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,360
What do you want?

250
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,300
I've known you for years. You've
never been the first to say hello.

251
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,010
I need help with my lines.

252
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,710
- Landon Carter's asking me for help?
- Yeah.

253
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,720
Okay, I'll pray for you.

254
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,920
Jamie, look-

255
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,460
You've obviously never asked anybody
for help before, right?

256
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,600
A request like yours requires
flattery and groveling.

257
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,290
It can't be about you.
It has to be for the common good.

258
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,310
It is for the common good.
Eddie Zimmerhoff deserves the best.

259
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:10,240
- Please?
- Okay. One condition, though.

260
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,110
What's that?

261
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,720
You have to promise
you won't fall in love with me.

262
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:24,420
- That's not a problem.
- Okay. I'll see you today after school.

263
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,730
Landon Carter is coming here?

264
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,170
He's dangerous, careless,
the worst kind of bully.

265
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:37,310
Daddy, what about forgiveness?

266
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,030
I thought we had discussed
that I would decide...

267
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,270
...how I wanted to spend
my time and my life.

268
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,710
It's him I don't trust, not you.

269
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,960
You gonna keep me out here
all afternoon?

270
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,130
Come on in.

271
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:14,540
My script is in my room. I'll be
right down. Make yourself at home.

272
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,740
Oh, yeah.

273
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:19,140
It's not likely.

274
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,000
That is one scary-looking-

275
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,000
- Jesus!
- No, Jamie's father.

276
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:48,010
Hello, Mr. Carter. I understand
you're the lead in the play.

277
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,940
Congratulations.

278
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,120
Thanks for letting me
come over and run lines.

279
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,410
I didn't let you.

280
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,390
It's a school night. Let's get
one thing straight, Mr. Carter.

281
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:07,290
You think that, on Sundays,
I don't see you from where I stand.

282
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:10,490
But I see you.

283
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,440
I'll be in my office, just here.

284
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,600
Ready?

285
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,540
Yeah, let's go.

286
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,580
- Landon! Where have you been?
- Nowhere.

287
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,590
- Hey, come here.
- What's up?

288
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:37,120
- Are we cool?
- Yeah, sure.

289
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,180
What the hell?

290
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,560
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same.

291
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:20,460
Do you normally walk alone
in a cemetery at night?

292
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,100
Maybe.

293
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,830
Where you going?

294
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,880
Come and see.

295
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,810
Okay. What is that?

296
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,750
This is my telescope.
I built it when I was 12.

297
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,850
Take a look.

298
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,600
Saturn. Very cool.

299
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:58,070
I'm planning on building a larger one
so I can see the comet Hyakutake.

300
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:02,140
It comes this spring.
Nobody knows when it'll be back.

301
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:06,110
Nature's miracles. I get it.

302
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,150
- Get what?
- That you're into all this stuff.

303
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,880
This stuff?

304
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,460
I have my beliefs.
I have faith, but don't you?

305
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,220
No. There's too much bad shit
in this world.

306
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,890
Without suffering,
there's no compassion.

307
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,760
Tell that to those who suffer.

308
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,780
This is what I love about early
spring. Where those legs been hiding?

309
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:37,480
- She's trashy.
- Well, if it isn't the Virgin Mary.

310
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,510
Here comes your leading lady.

311
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,750
Hey, Carter.
So I'll see you after school?

312
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,790
In your dreams.

313
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:01,800
Hi. Where's your sweater?

314
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,910
Let's get out of here.

315
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:13,980
What's up, dude?

316
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,680
Come on, Jamie.
Open the door, please!

317
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,610
What do you want?

318
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,590
- You're not in a good mood.
- You don't miss a thing.

319
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:57,790
Listen, I was hoping
we could run lines together.

320
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:01,160
Okay, but just not
so anybody knows, right?

321
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:06,000
I just figured we could surprise
everyone with how good I get.

322
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,000
We could be secret friends.

323
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,970
Exactly! It's like
you're reading my mind.

324
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,610
Great. Maybe you could read mine?

325
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:23,010
Jamie, I can't just be your friend.

326
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:28,420
Landon, I thought I saw something
in you. Something good.

327
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,130
But I was very wrong.

328
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,330
Damn it!

329
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,780
Sorry. Sorry.

330
00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:25,610
You know the answer?

331
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,450
Come on, man, I know you know.

332
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:40,420
Okay. It's you, me and the basket.

333
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:43,190
We form the three corners
of a triangle.

334
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,990
Take a step towards the basket.

335
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,130
Am I at the same angle to you
and the basket as before?

336
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:54,140
- Yeah.
- Are you?

337
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,970
- Yeah.
- So, what did we just make?

338
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:05,510
- A similar triangle?
- Yes. Okay, make me an isosceles.

339
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:10,790
You got it, two sides the same.

340
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,720
Okay, enough of this. Let's play.

341
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,060
I came to say I'm sorry.

342
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,590
Well, you did. Feel better?

343
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:36,000
No. I feel like shit.

344
00:35:36,210 --> 00:35:41,170
You know what? I actually thought
I wanted to be your friend.

345
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:48,380
And now I have no idea why. No idea.

346
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,220
I made that jump once.

347
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,280
I thought I was a badass.

348
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:02,690
I remember actually saying
that I meant to belly flop.

349
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,860
Did it hurt?

350
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,470
Like hell.

351
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,240
Good.

352
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:25,250
So I guess I'll see
you at school then.

353
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:33,100
- Pour me a drink, Joey.
- You promised me, Tommy.

354
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,460
No more of your no-goodnik schemes.

355
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:39,070
You promised me we'd go to Paris.

356
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,040
I won't sit on my keister
and watch the fat cats get rich.

357
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,180
Trust me. This is a sure thing.

358
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,240
That's it! We are through!

359
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,410
Go ahead and run your booze,
you big dope!

360
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,350
And I hope you drown in it!

361
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,180
So you must be the new girl
he's hired.

362
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,120
The singer?

363
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:07,130
You want some free advice
about this one? Stay far away.

364
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,770
He's nothing but trouble
in cheap spats.

365
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,530
Look, I ain't blaming you.

366
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:19,470
I ain't asking for forgiveness,
either.

367
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:22,810
I just did what I had to.

368
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:33,090
When you walked out of the rain
and into my club...

369
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,920
...that wasn't just coincidence,
was it?

370
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:39,290
Nothing's coincidence.

371
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,990
Your face... You look so familiar.

372
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,900
Like this dame I knew once,
only it wasn't real, it was a dream.

373
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,630
Tell me about this dream girl.

374
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:00,470
Well, I don't remember.

375
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,620
All I know...

376
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,990
...is you're beautiful.

377
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,860
The song, the song.

378
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,310
The dream.

379
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,340
Help me to remember.

380
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,670
Will you sing for me?

381
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,690
That was great.

382
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,460
Hi, kids.

383
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:52,040
Honey, I couldn't believe it.
What a transformation.

384
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,830
Thanks, but please stop.

385
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:56,540
- Don't be home too late.
- Okay. Thanks.

386
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,980
Okay, okay.

387
00:42:59,850 --> 00:43:03,510
- Interesting rewrite you did there.
- I did my best.

388
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,120
Your acting didn't suck either.

389
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,920
- Gotta go. Take it easy, man.
- Okay.

390
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,390
- Landon, you were marvelous!
- Thank you.

391
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:20,260
Landon? Fine performance, son.

392
00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,340
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd get a bite.

393
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,740
- I'm not hungry.
- Don't walk away.

394
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,710
You taught me how.

395
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,680
Oh, my God.

396
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:42,180
Look who's here.

397
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,630
Don't look at him.

398
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,390
You don't want to stare too much.

399
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:56,510
I guess he doesn't want
to sit with us.

400
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:13,810
- People can see.
- That would ruin your reputation how?

401
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:15,510
What's that?

402
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:21,990
I'm reading books on Rothman's list
of contemporary American authors.

403
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:26,690
- And how many books are there?
- A hundred.

404
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:31,740
But then there's his British list
and his European list.

405
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:36,240
So is this on your list,
to read all these books?

406
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:46,950
Jamie, I'm trying here, okay?

407
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,850
Maybe...

408
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:54,120
Maybe I miss spending time with you.

409
00:44:54,330 --> 00:44:59,170
- Maybe you inspire me.
- Sounds like bull.

410
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,060
- Which part?
- All of it.

411
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:04,170
- It's not.
- Prove it.

412
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:13,940
Jamie!

413
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,890
- You've no idea how to be a friend.
- I don't just want that.

414
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,220
- You don't know what you want.
- You're scared someone wants you.

415
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:27,730
- Why would that scare me?
- You couldn't hide behind books...

416
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,730
...or your fricking telescope,
or your faith.

417
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:35,170
No. You know the real reason
why you're scared?

418
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:38,170
It's because you want
to be with me too.

419
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:01,790
We gonna get this party jumping!

420
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:05,970
Can you turn down Soul Train?
Some of us are trying to work.

421
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:09,570
You really know how
to bust a robot's groove.

422
00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:14,400
It's all good because we'll get Club
Landon and Club Eric jumping now.

423
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,270
What we got here?

424
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:22,680
Okay, okay, you're not feeling my
hip-hop, but what the hell is this?

425
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:25,520
Jamie lent it to me.

426
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,320
You're listening
to her people's music.

427
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,120
- Her people?
- Yeah...

428
00:46:30,330 --> 00:46:34,760
...her Bible-hugging,
crucifix-wearing...

429
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,800
...honk-if-you-love-Jesus people.

430
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,900
- She's not like that.
- Well...

431
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:43,870
...you got Belinda thinking
that little lip action...

432
00:46:44,070 --> 00:46:46,910
...between you and Jamie
was kind of real.

433
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:58,280
What's with you? You don't have time
for your real friends anymore.

434
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:02,580
I don't know, buddy. I'm just over it.

435
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:06,420
I'm sick and tired of doing
the same shit all the time.

436
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:10,860
This girl's changed you,
and you don't even know it, man.

437
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,760
- Let me guess, Belinda say that too?
- No.

438
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,730
I did.

439
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,010
You.

440
00:47:30,190 --> 00:47:32,520
Me.

441
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,720
What is it?

442
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:41,160
I got you something.

443
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:46,770
Thank you.

444
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:52,970
Well, I'll see you at school.

445
00:47:53,610 --> 00:47:55,270
Okay.

446
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,920
- Mr. Carter.
- Later, Reverend.

447
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,300
Boys like that...

448
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:36,280
...they have...

449
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,690
They have expectations.

450
00:48:43,890 --> 00:48:47,490
The rules around here
aren't going to change.

451
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,670
Fine.

452
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:56,800
You might not care
what I say or think...

453
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,000
...but you should care
about God's opinion.

454
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,780
I think he wants me to be happy.

455
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:10,440
Dad, it's just a sweater.

456
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:13,550
I'm going to make us
some dinner, okay?

457
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,470
I talked to your dad today.

458
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:32,500
Said he saw you at the play
for about 10 seconds.

459
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:37,080
Sending a check once a month doesn't
exactly make him a father.

460
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:43,910
- Landon, there are a lot of reasons-
- He left us.

461
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,680
You need to forgive him too.

462
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:57,460
Jamie Sullivan! Oh, me, oh, my,
look at Jamie Sullivan.

463
00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,360
She was looking all right
in that play.

464
00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:02,940
She doesn't look hot.

465
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:08,410
Yeah, I would have to say during
the play, she looked hot.

466
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,480
I have the best idea.

467
00:50:11,610 --> 00:50:14,910
Can you do something, like, move it?

468
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,220
Maybe move it around
a little something here.

469
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,450
Take one.

470
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,950
Let me stop it for a second.
Check it out.

471
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:31,960
Hey, look at this.

472
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:34,030
Here.

473
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:37,370
Take one. Look.

474
00:50:42,010 --> 00:50:45,410
- Jamie. Hi.
- Hi.

475
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,980
Listen, I just want you to know,
no hard feelings.

476
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:53,350
Landon and I are way over.

477
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,850
I really don't know
what you're talking about.

478
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,760
You'd be so beautiful...

479
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,830
...if you knew how to do your makeup.

480
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,770
- Come on, eat lunch with me.
- Okay.

481
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,960
- Want a Tic Tac?
- No, thanks.

482
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,660
Okay.

483
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,050
Wow.

484
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,730
Is that you?

485
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,530
Nice bod.

486
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:11,360
Look, this is about me, okay?
This is not you.

487
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:13,560
Stay here.

488
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:20,640
Hey, man, no wonder you been
keeping her locked up.

489
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,110
I had no idea this was
underneath all that.

490
00:52:26,410 --> 00:52:28,880
- Dean, stop!
- You stay out of this!

491
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:40,800
- We're through. We're through.
- That's great.

492
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:43,120
- We're through forever!
- You okay?

493
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:45,890
- You made a mistake, Landon!
- You sure?

494
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:47,860
Let's get out of here.

495
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,540
Hey! You're a little chickenshit!

496
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:55,840
Baby, I'm sorry. Okay?

497
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:59,280
They're animals, all right?

498
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,850
You want me to take you home?

499
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,750
Let's get out of here.

500
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:11,650
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

501
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,930
- Thank you for everything.
- You're welcome.

502
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:27,070
- I want to ask you something.
- Okay.

503
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:35,850
Will you go out with me
on Saturday night?

504
00:53:38,950 --> 00:53:41,720
I'm sorry. I can't go.

505
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:48,900
- You have something else going on?
- No.

506
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,360
- It's not that.
- Then what is it?

507
00:53:59,510 --> 00:54:01,740
I'm not allowed to date.

508
00:54:06,550 --> 00:54:11,040
"Do not be deceived.
God is not mocked.

509
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:17,920
Whatever a man sows,
that he will also reap.

510
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,890
For he who sows to his flesh,
will of the flesh reap-"

511
00:54:23,100 --> 00:54:25,930
- Can I help you?
- Yes, sir.

512
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:29,870
I'd like to ask your daughter
to dinner on Saturday night.

513
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:32,270
That's not possible.

514
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:40,140
With all due respect, sir,
I ask you to reconsider.

515
00:54:40,350 --> 00:54:44,790
With all due respect, Mr. Carter,
I made my decision.

516
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:50,590
You can exit the way you entered.

517
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:58,900
I'm sorry I haven't treated
Jamie the way I should have.

518
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,760
She deserves more than that.

519
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:05,300
I'm asking you for the same thing...

520
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,740
...you teach us every day in church.

521
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:12,400
And that's faith.

522
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,620
I can't believe you asked permission.

523
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:24,850
It's no big deal.
He was cool about it, anyway.

524
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,890
- Thank you.
- This is for you.

525
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:30,830
- Thank you very much.
- Would you like something to drink?

526
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:33,300
- Sweet tea, please.
- Make that two.

527
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,230
Right away.

528
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,870
This place is really nice.
Is this okay?

529
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:43,910
- Don't even worry about it, okay?
- Okay.

530
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:46,410
Choose whatever you want.

531
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,740
So, what'll it be?

532
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,950
Is everything okay?

533
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:57,250
- Thank you very much.
- Yeah, me too. Thanks.

534
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,330
Would you like to dance?

535
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,270
Sorry, I don't dance.

536
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:15,240
Me neither. I mean, not usually
in front of anybody.

537
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:21,240
Well, no. I mean, I don't at all.
As in, I can't.

538
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:24,210
Everybody can dance.

539
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:27,220
Come on, you can't be that bad.

540
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,290
Please?

541
00:56:30,930 --> 00:56:32,590
For me?

542
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,590
Come on.

543
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:54,670
Sorry, I told you I was bad at this.

544
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,120
- In all fairness, you warned me, right?
- That's right.

545
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,790
So, what's number one on your list?

546
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,400
Okay.

547
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:16,090
Number one on my list
is getting out of Beaufort.

548
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:20,260
Getting out won't be your problem.

549
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,040
It's more like figuring out what to do
when you get somewhere.

550
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,180
What do you mean?

551
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,020
I mean, you can do anything.

552
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:53,170
- Where are we going?
- Just hold on, you'll see.

553
00:57:57,010 --> 00:58:00,000
Come on, come on. Let's go!

554
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:02,980
- What are we doing?
- Run!

555
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:06,450
- Okay, okay. Stand there.
- All right.

556
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:10,590
- One foot there, and one foot here.
- Okay.

557
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:15,660
You're acting crazy. What's going on?

558
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,130
Right now, you're straddling
the state line.

559
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,530
Okay.

560
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:27,870
You're in two places at once.

561
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,450
Okay, butterfly, rosebud or star?

562
00:58:44,660 --> 00:58:46,650
You choose.

563
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,360
- Butterfly.
- Okay.

564
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,500
Where do you want it?

565
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:03,740
Right here.

566
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:13,250
Okay.

567
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:23,920
How can you see places like this...

568
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:28,960
...and have moments like this,
and not believe?

569
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,460
You're lucky to be so sure.

570
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,240
It's like the wind.

571
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:45,510
I can't see it, but I feel it.

572
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:47,810
What do you feel?

573
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:55,210
I feel wonder and beauty...

574
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:59,190
...joy, love.

575
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:04,390
I mean, it's the center of everything.

576
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,200
I might kiss you.

577
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:14,840
I might be bad at it.

578
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:20,710
That's not possible.

579
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,200
I love you.

580
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:04,630
Now would be the time
to say something.

581
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:10,690
I told you not to fall in love with me.

582
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:22,160
Jamie. Say good night to Mr. Carter.

583
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:26,930
Landon, go home. The night's over.

584
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:28,840
- Good night.
- Good night.

585
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:30,940
Good night, sir.

586
01:03:34,420 --> 01:03:37,850
Jamie, your behavior's sinful.

587
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:43,750
- You act with that boy like you're-
- In love?

588
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:48,260
- Jamie, you are a child.
- Dad, look at me...

589
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:52,060
- ...I'm not a child.
- Then stop acting childish.

590
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,640
I love him.

591
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:04,810
Then be fair to him, Jamie,
before things get worse.

592
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,720
- Hey.
- Hey.

593
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:33,870
- Will you help me?
- Yeah.

594
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:37,010
So, what did you tell your father?

595
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:41,170
The truth. I just left you out of it.

596
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,440
So, what do you want to see?

597
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,880
Pluto.

598
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:50,610
Pluto only rises a few minutes
before the sun.

599
01:04:50,830 --> 01:04:52,660
Right...

600
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:57,890
...and I have brought us
a thermos of hot coffee...

601
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,800
...and a blanket.

602
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:06,840
- You planned this.
- Oh, I hoped for it.

603
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:11,200
Are you trying to seduce me?

604
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,610
Why? Are you seducible?

605
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:19,780
That's what I thought...

606
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,650
...ergo, a second blanket.

607
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:26,850
- One for me, and one for you.
- Thank you.

608
01:05:38,710 --> 01:05:43,910
- Can you find this star right here?
- Sure.

609
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:57,380
So why am I looking for this star?

610
01:05:58,390 --> 01:06:01,090
Because I had it named for you.

611
01:06:03,260 --> 01:06:04,930
See?

612
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:07,600
It's official.

613
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,640
It's from the International
Star Registry.

614
01:06:16,210 --> 01:06:18,440
This is wonderful!

615
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,410
I love you.

616
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:42,290
Okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm stopping.

617
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:54,880
So, what's your number one?

618
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:02,680
To marry in the church
where my mother grew up.

619
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:05,720
That's where my parents were married.

620
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:38,790
- Did you just get in?
- Yeah.

621
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:42,390
Thank heavens I didn't know.
I'd have been panicked.

622
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,290
Sorry.

623
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:49,430
Landon, were you with Jamie?

624
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:53,000
Landon, be careful.
She's the reverend's daughter.

625
01:07:53,210 --> 01:07:55,680
- Mom-
- Please!

626
01:07:56,040 --> 01:07:57,940
It's different with her.

627
01:07:58,250 --> 01:08:01,610
- It's different with her.
- Yes.

628
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:06,680
It better be different with her.

629
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:13,820
I was doing laundry the other day,
and I found this.

630
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:24,540
"Examine a moon rock.

631
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:28,070
Go to college.

632
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,970
Get into medical school."

633
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:42,020
Honey, these are really
beautiful ambitions.

634
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:48,720
- But you'll have to work really hard.
- I can do that.

635
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,560
Yeah, you can.

636
01:08:58,070 --> 01:09:00,270
Mama...

637
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:04,100
...Jamie has faith in me.

638
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,240
You know?

639
01:09:07,950 --> 01:09:12,150
She makes me want to be different.

640
01:09:13,050 --> 01:09:15,020
Better.

641
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:20,130
I was so drunk,
I don't remember anything.

642
01:09:25,030 --> 01:09:29,130
That's great.
Citizen high to citizen low.

643
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:35,200
Are you worried
about your college applications?

644
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,840
No.

645
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:39,570
I'm not applying.

646
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:43,580
- I thought you said-
- No, you assumed.

647
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:48,190
- Take a year off, try the Peace Corps?
- No.

648
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,420
What are you gonna do?

649
01:09:55,860 --> 01:09:57,760
I'm sick.

650
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:01,660
- I'll take you home, you'll be-
- No, Landon!

651
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,970
I'm sick.

652
01:10:07,940 --> 01:10:10,430
I have leukemia.

653
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,440
No.

654
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:21,080
- You're 18, you're perfect.
- No.

655
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:25,920
I found out two years ago.
I've stopped responding to treatments.

656
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:33,100
So why didn't you tell me?

657
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:37,630
The doctor said I should live life
normally, as best I could.

658
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,210
I didn't want anybody
to be weird around me.

659
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:44,670
- Including me?
- Especially you!

660
01:10:47,650 --> 01:10:52,680
I was getting along fine.
I accepted it, and then you happened!

661
01:10:57,020 --> 01:11:01,360
I do not need a reason
to be angry with God.

662
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,420
Dad, open the door!

663
01:12:22,780 --> 01:12:24,270
Landon?

664
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:28,750
- I need your help.
- What's wrong? You okay?

665
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:32,410
It's my girlfriend, Jamie. She's...

666
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:39,490
She's got cancer. And I need you
to come and see her right now.

667
01:12:39,660 --> 01:12:41,420
Okay, calm down.

668
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,160
- Can you help me or not?
- I don't know her case.

669
01:12:45,370 --> 01:12:49,460
I don't know her history.
I'm a cardiologist. I can't-

670
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:54,200
You know, just forget it. I knew it.

671
01:12:54,410 --> 01:12:57,780
Would you wait? Landon, wait!

672
01:14:35,740 --> 01:14:38,340
Your mom called me.

673
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,750
Talk to me, man.

674
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,140
About what?

675
01:14:46,450 --> 01:14:48,320
About you...

676
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:50,620
...about Jamie.

677
01:14:53,990 --> 01:14:56,520
What's there to talk about?

678
01:14:58,330 --> 01:15:01,460
She's the best person I've ever known.

679
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,400
I didn't understand.

680
01:15:13,650 --> 01:15:15,910
It's okay, man.

681
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,290
It's okay.

682
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:46,310
It's so nice to see you again.
You're welcome. Watch yourself now.

683
01:15:49,220 --> 01:15:51,620
I'm not going anywhere.

684
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:54,440
Please tell Jamie that.

685
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:28,980
I'm so sorry.
I really should have told you sooner.

686
01:16:29,190 --> 01:16:31,280
I made you do too many things-

687
01:16:31,490 --> 01:16:34,690
If anything,
you kept me healthy longer.

688
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:46,240
Are you scared?

689
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,800
To death.

690
01:16:52,250 --> 01:16:54,110
Lighten up.

691
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,580
It's not funny.

692
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,870
I'm scared of not being with you.

693
01:17:24,610 --> 01:17:27,600
Oh, baby, that will never happen.

694
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:38,590
I'll be here.

695
01:17:41,730 --> 01:17:43,060
Mom.

696
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:47,690
Can you do me a favor?

697
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:22,430
So I talked to Eric.

698
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:31,730
Need some help with this stuff?

699
01:19:32,270 --> 01:19:33,800
Sure.

700
01:20:11,410 --> 01:20:14,070
What's that boy doing in the yard?

701
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:20,110
What's the matter? Jamie, honey?

702
01:21:26,190 --> 01:21:30,620
Landon. Run along, son.

703
01:21:30,820 --> 01:21:33,090
I'm not tired.

704
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,530
I need just a minute with her.

705
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:49,340
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

706
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,130
Daddy...

707
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,700
...so serious.

708
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:34,740
Do you remember
when you were about 5 or 6...

709
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:38,220
...and you said you hated gravity...

710
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:41,830
...and you wanted
to jump off the roof and fly?

711
01:22:44,130 --> 01:22:48,760
I was so angry at you
for making me come down.

712
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:54,370
Honey, if I kept you too close, it's
because I wanted to keep you longer.

713
01:22:55,540 --> 01:22:57,200
Dad...

714
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:05,780
You know, when I lost your mother...

715
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:15,090
...I was afraid that my heart
would never open again.

716
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:26,600
Jamie, I couldn't look
at you for days.

717
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,010
But then...

718
01:23:38,450 --> 01:23:41,780
I love you so much.

719
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:11,880
I wanted to give you these.

720
01:24:12,290 --> 01:24:15,050
The pictures from the play.

721
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:24,690
- I'm sorry about the flyers.
- It doesn't matter.

722
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:31,660
I guess you're with who you should be.

723
01:24:33,010 --> 01:24:35,200
It's like she chose you.

724
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,840
Yeah, I don't even know why.

725
01:24:42,580 --> 01:24:44,550
I do.

726
01:25:24,590 --> 01:25:26,320
How you feeling?

727
01:25:26,530 --> 01:25:30,120
- I'm okay. How are you?
- Pretty good.

728
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:33,360
- I have something for you.
- You do?

729
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:41,900
Don't worry, it's not a Bible.

730
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:47,710
It was my mother's. It's got quotes
from her favorite books...

731
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:52,580
...and quotes by famous people.
Her thoughts.

732
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:58,790
- Come on.
- Okay, let's check it out.

733
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:08,560
"What is a friend?

734
01:26:08,770 --> 01:26:14,260
It's a single soul dwelling
in two bodies. Aristotle."

735
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:18,040
- Right here.
- Okay.

736
01:26:18,680 --> 01:26:21,170
"Find out who you are...

737
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:24,280
...and do it on purpose."

738
01:26:25,390 --> 01:26:27,250
That's Dolly Parton.

739
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:31,420
I always thought she was smart.

740
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:47,310
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous.

741
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,740
Love is never boastful or conceited.

742
01:26:52,150 --> 01:26:55,710
It is never rude or selfish.

743
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:01,050
It does not take offense
and is not resentful."

744
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:13,200
- You know what I figured out today?
- What?

745
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:19,800
Maybe God...

746
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:25,340
...has a bigger plan for me
than I had for myself.

747
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:31,380
Like, this journey never ends.

748
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:37,520
Like, you were sent to me
because I'm sick.

749
01:27:40,590 --> 01:27:43,530
To help me through all this.

750
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:57,180
You're my angel.

751
01:28:14,930 --> 01:28:16,220
What's going on?

752
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:21,300
I get to go home.
Please thank your father for me.

753
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:25,400
- What does she mean?
- He's been trying to reach you.

754
01:28:25,610 --> 01:28:29,230
He's going to pay
for private home care.

755
01:28:58,810 --> 01:29:00,670
Thank you.

756
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,650
Sorry.

757
01:29:24,760 --> 01:29:27,630
It's all right, son.

758
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:09,210
- I gotta finish this tonight.
- Here, something hot.

759
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:14,600
Almost finished.
Did you order the mirrors?

760
01:30:14,810 --> 01:30:17,410
- Yeah, they're in here.
- Good.

761
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:21,580
- What about side bearings?
- An old phonographic turntable.

762
01:30:21,790 --> 01:30:25,520
So you think you can get
all this done by tomorrow?

763
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:30,820
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

764
01:30:31,130 --> 01:30:33,190
It's beautiful.

765
01:30:33,400 --> 01:30:36,270
Okay, it's time. Go check it out.

766
01:31:16,710 --> 01:31:18,070
There it is.

767
01:31:20,950 --> 01:31:24,380
Come here. Come look.

768
01:31:26,450 --> 01:31:29,350
Come here. Come look, quick.

769
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:40,890
That is cool.

770
01:31:50,710 --> 01:31:52,230
Do you love me?

771
01:31:59,690 --> 01:32:04,450
- Will you do something for me then?
- Anything.

772
01:32:07,490 --> 01:32:09,980
Will you marry me?

773
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:40,550
"Love is always patient and kind.
It is never jealous."

774
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:45,990
- I love you.
- "Love is never boastful nor conceited.

775
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:48,720
It is never rude or selfish.

776
01:33:48,930 --> 01:33:53,760
It does not take offense
and is not resentful.

777
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:58,340
Love takes no pleasure
in other people's sins...

778
01:33:58,540 --> 01:34:02,470
...but delights in the truth.

779
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:08,050
It is always ready to excuse,
to trust, to hope...

780
01:34:08,250 --> 01:34:10,810
...and to endure...

781
01:34:12,180 --> 01:34:14,280
...whatever comes."

782
01:34:15,090 --> 01:34:19,460
- I, Landon Rollins Carter...
- I, Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan...

783
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,020
...do solemnly swear...

784
01:34:22,230 --> 01:34:26,360
- ...to take Jamie Sullivan...
- ...to take Landon Rollins Carter...

785
01:34:26,570 --> 01:34:28,730
- ...as my wife.
- ...as my husband.

786
01:34:28,930 --> 01:34:34,900
To honor and to cherish her,
all the days of my life.

787
01:34:54,660 --> 01:34:58,360
Jamie and I had a perfect
summer together...

788
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,330
... with more love than lots ofpeople
know in a lifetime.

789
01:35:03,540 --> 01:35:08,060
And then she went,
with her unfailing faith.

790
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,190
It's been four years...

791
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:38,000
...but the vision ofJamie
walking towards me...

792
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:42,240
... will stay with me forever.

793
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:46,750
Hello, Mr. Carter. Come in.

794
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,780
- Have a seat, please.
- Thank you.

795
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,450
Landon.

796
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:12,170
- You look good.
- Thank you. You too.

797
01:36:12,370 --> 01:36:14,530
I'm getting by.

798
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,620
- What's new, Landon?
- Well, I got into medical school.

799
01:36:30,820 --> 01:36:32,980
Your mother told me that.

800
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:38,820
We're so proud of you. Jamie would
have been proud of you too.

801
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:43,530
Listen.

802
01:36:49,110 --> 01:36:53,810
I want you to have this.

803
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:56,580
Oh, Landon.

804
01:37:02,620 --> 01:37:04,610
Oh, my.

805
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:08,580
Thank you.

806
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:16,460
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.

807
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:23,060
She did.

808
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:27,270
It was you.

809
01:37:36,190 --> 01:37:39,250
Jamie saved my life.

810
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:42,760
She taught me everything.

811
01:37:43,130 --> 01:37:46,500
About life, hope...

812
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:49,430
...and the longjourney ahead.

813
01:37:50,840 --> 01:37:53,240
I'll always miss her.

814
01:37:54,570 --> 01:37:58,810
But our love is like the wind.

815
01:38:00,580 --> 01:38:03,010
I can't see it...

816
01:38:03,380 --> 01:38:05,680
...but I can feel it.
