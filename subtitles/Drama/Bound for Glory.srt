1
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,313
<i>I知 goin' to California</i>

2
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:34,113
<i>and I値l be sleepin' out every night</i>

3
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,800
<i>I知 goin' to California</i>

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,957
<i>but I値l be sleepin' out every night</i>

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,958
<i>cos' them Oklahoma women</i>

6
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,719
<i>Well, they just ain't a-treatin' me right</i>

7
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,959
<i>Well, I would rather drink muddy water</i>

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,719
<i>Whoa, and sleep in a hollow log</i>

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,513
<i>Well, I would rather drink muddy water</i>

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,713
<i>Whoa, and sleep in a hollow log</i>

11
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,832
<i>Than be down here in Texas</i>

12
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,269
<i>Treated like a low-down dog</i>

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,434
<i>Well, them California waters</i>

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,358
<i>They taste like cherry wine</i>

15
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,040
<i>Them California waters</i>

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,073
<i>Taste just like cherry wine</i>

17
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,235
Yeah.

18
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,828
Cherry wine

19
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,428
Cherry wine. Goddammit, Woody!

20
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,838
I致e got half a notion to pull up stakes
and hit the road for California.

21
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,112
I been thinking about heading down the
Gulf of Mexico or the Rio Grande valley.

22
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,597
Just somewhere's where
I could grow some fruit. Peaches.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:51,235
Them Indian blood peaches,
with that red meat.

24
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,954
Shit fire, Carl! Why down there?

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:58,995
In California, you just plop a seed in the
ground and it sprouts the very next day.

26
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,350
Seems I sure gotta do somethin'.

27
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:06,315
I just don't know what's gonna happen
to everybody around here.

28
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
You folks sure are depressin'.

29
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,718
Well, I got one.

30
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,590
- Put a buck's worth in.
- Yes, sir!

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,554
A buck's worth
of the finest gasoline in Texas.

32
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,996
You boys got any news?

33
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,797
Ain't nothin' interestin' to tell, except
people are movin' out of these parts.

34
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,630
My name's Collister, and I been runnin' all
over this here state to them fortune-tellers.

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,957
Ain't a one of 'em's told me a damn thing.

36
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,030
Someone tell me somethin' worth
listenin' to, and I値l pay 'em a dollar.

37
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,440
It's been pretty dusty around here.

38
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,359
Hell, Woody,
that ain't worth nothin', for sure!

39
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,231
Well, I ain't much for fortune-tellin'.

40
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,311
You're a inside man.
Got a big job with the oil refinery?

41
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,474
- How'd you know that?
- Well...

42
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,356
Ain't nobody else got money to waste
on fortune-tellers and soda pop.

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,996
Keep goin'.

44
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,632
Well, them creases
in between your eyebrows,

45
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,036
You're probably a man
takes his work serious.

46
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,272
Always lookin' for a way
to do things better.

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,119
You get 50 cents

48
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,196
Keep talkin'.

49
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,953
Well, you probably got some kind of idea.

50
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,758
An invention of some kind.

51
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,678
A big company wants to buy you out.

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,031
You get a paper dollar
if you tell me when to do it.

53
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,433
Hell, I ain't no mind-reader.

54
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,272
You're the only one I ever met that didn't
claim to know everything in the world.

55
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,789
- What's your name?
- Woody.

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,796
Woody Guthrie.

57
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,950
Well, Guthrie, I値l spread the word.
You're worth every penny.

58
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,712
Thank you kindly.

59
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,673
There's a nickel for the coke,
a dollar for the gas.

60
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,756
The momma bear says:

61
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,316
"Ain't nobody gonna eat none of my
porridge and get away with it."

62
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,635
So she takes up a pair of sheep shears

63
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,833
And she cuts every hair
off the top of that little kid's head.

64
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,077
- Good one, daddy.
- Yeah, ain't that somethin'?

65
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,240
Then old Goldilocks,
she just heads on back into the forest

66
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,432
and she goes to sleep for about 20 years.

67
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,791
When she wakes up
all her hair is growed back.

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,877
Well, looks pretty good, don't it?

69
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,956
It looks darn good.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,869
But... there ain't nobody round here
gonna pay you to talk to 'em.

71
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,549
Oh, now, that fella down at the gas station

72
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,912
said I was the best fortune-teller
he had ever seen.

73
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:59,157
That weren't nothin' but happenstance,
and you know it.

74
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,877
You could be makin' regular money with
your sign paintin', Woody, if you tried.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,436
Just ain't no sense in harpin' on it, Mary.

76
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,754
It'll do no good.

77
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,794
You could do it. You could do 'em so
special, somebody'd be sure to want 'em.

78
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,356
Come on in and...

79
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,034
...talk it over

80
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,672
Lay your head upon my shoulder

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,717
she's my curly-headed baby

82
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,109
come from sunny Tennessee

83
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,390
 Iain't really a doctor.

84
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,590
Well, she ain't sick exactly.

85
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,076
Her oldest girl died of the dust pneumonia
almost a week ago.

86
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,033
She ain't drunk a drop since.
She can't swallow.

87
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,789
- I don't see how i...
- some fortune-tellers have got the gift.

88
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,435
Healin', layin' on of hands,
discernin' of spirits.

89
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,790
I ain't really a fortune-teller.

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:20,675
Poor little thing. We can't just
let her waste away. Go on.

91
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,076
Ma'am?

92
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,791
Do you have faith that you'll be cured?

93
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,036
Well, look.

94
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,033
Your daughter.
Don't you believe she's up in heaven?

95
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,433
Well...

96
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,713
that means you believe in god.

97
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,753
And if there's a god,
then it was him gave you your mind.

98
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:28,635
Well, everybody knows the mind's
the boss of the whole body.

99
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,355
It just tells all the nerves
and muscles what to do.

100
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,631
Your arms and hands and back.

101
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,076
Throat.

102
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,595
You don't wanna die, do you? Leave
your husband and your kids all alone?

103
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,599
Your husband wants you to talk to him,
don't he? Your kids to boot.

104
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,475
There ain't no two ways about that!

105
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,591
Could I have some water here?

106
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,438
Away all that monkey business.

107
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,192
Just send a message straight down there
to your throat, mouth, and...

108
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,552
tell 'em to just swig down this here water.

109
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,398
Thank you.

110
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,635
Just try.

111
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,239
Just do it.

112
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,239
Afterwards, you tell me how dandy it was.

113
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,036
Now...

114
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,080
now you swallow it. Swallow it.

115
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,436
That was easy.

116
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,199
You did it! You can do it some more.

117
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,871
Next couple of days, I want you two ladies
to pour water down this lady's throat.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,790
Why, you can have a water-drinkin'
contest every now and then.

119
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,034
You just talk to her now about everything.

120
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,394
Talk to her.

121
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,476
You'll be ok.

122
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,399
All right.

123
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,830
See, you don't... you don't owe me nothin'.

124
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,632
Bless you, Mr. Guthrie.

125
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,836
Phew-ee!

126
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,996
I did it!

127
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,916
I think.

128
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,674
- Afternoon, Donna Jo.
- Good afternoon, Woody.

129
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,031
Woody? Do you and Mary
have any use for a bedroom set?

130
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,518
It's real nice. It's called
the waterfall design or somethin'.

131
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,950
I just hate to leave it, sat there.

132
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,070
Howdy, Jesse.

133
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,589
Uh, sure.

134
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,188
Sure, I guess we can do somethin' with it.

135
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:34,474
Good. There's an old chair in there too.
We just ain't got room for everything.

136
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,036
- Where are you folks goin'?
- California.

137
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,037
I don't know, it just seems like
everything ran out around here...

138
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,993
when Jesse got laid off.

139
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,475
Y'all are welcome to anything you find
in there that you wanna use.

140
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,717
Ok. Thank you kindly, Donna Jo.
You folks take care.

141
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,469
They might have jobs in that
new department store in Amarillo.

142
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,273
Hell, pa, I ain't gonna be
no shoe salesman.

143
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,758
- There might be somethin' else.
- It's too damn far out there anyhow.

144
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,111
You tell her that when she's beggin'
for milk in the mornin'.

145
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,916
- Tell her it's too far to travel.
- Mary, it's 62 miles.

146
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:40,436
Well, maybe you could sing one of your
songs to her or tell her fortune instead.

147
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,314
- Just don't start in on me, ok?
- It don't do no good to be carryin' on.

148
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,991
Times and the weather are bad enough.
It just don't do no good.

149
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,990
I don't mean to be startin' in.
I don't mean to always be at you, Woody.

150
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,350
But it just don't seem fair.

151
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:04,470
Even your brother's been out lookin'
for somethin', and he's just a boy.

152
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,075
How about some new signs
on your truck?

153
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,156
No, not today, Woody.

154
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,188
What in the hell are you doin'?
I told you I wanted white on black.

155
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,199
I thought you'd like red better.
Shows up from a mile away.

156
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,471
I asked for white on black
and you give me this red bitch thing?

157
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,156
Was you plannin' on gettin' paid for this?

158
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,316
- I was plannin' on it.
- Well, just plan away, Guthrie.

159
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,513
What am I supposed to do
with this red bitch anyways?

160
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:55,795
Why don't you fold it five ways
and stick it where the sun don't shine?

161
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,629
I値l tell you what else I don't need.
I don't need none of your lip neither!

162
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,629
Ain't you kids got nothin' better to do
than lollygag around here?

163
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,432
She's my curly-headed baby

164
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,591
used to sit on daddy's knee

165
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,470
she's my curly-headed baby

166
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,752
come from sunny Tennessee

167
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,150
and I知 gonna tell you
'bout these women

168
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,471
I知 gonna tell you what they do

169
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,952
lay their head upon your shoulder

170
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,710
flirt around...

171
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,718
did you really write that song about me?

172
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,752
Sure. Sure it's about you. Damn right.

173
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,233
Curly-headed lady...

174
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,794
remember what you asked me?

175
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,071
It hasn't been outta my mind for a second.

176
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,192
- I don't care.
- Don't care about what?

177
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,470
If we do.

178
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,989
- Do what?
- You know.

179
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,076
Come on.

180
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,033
Guess this town ain't entirely dead yet.

181
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:47,558
I don't know if you knew it or not,
but you lookin' at an insane man.

182
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,556
Well...

183
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,151
why don't you take off
a couple of sweaters and sit down?

184
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,556
I really am insane.

185
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,280
Well, hell...

186
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,039
hell, so am i. Off and on.

187
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:19,432
I heard tell about you in the next town
and thought I壇 better come.

188
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,835
I been in the insane asylum twice.

189
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,951
You have?

190
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,559
Maybe I better watch out,
havin' you around the place.

191
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,676
I wasn't crazy when they sent me there,
but then I beat up them two guards and...

192
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,710
now I知 a-here,
and even if they get me pretty quick,

193
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,719
 Iwanted to tell you
 Igot newsreels in my head.

194
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,396
- Newsreels?
- Yeah.

195
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,877
Since I was a kid. And my momma
always told me I was crazy.

196
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,836
They just never stop.

197
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,315
What kind of newsreels?

198
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,672
That the boom is over,
and the weeds are blowin' out,

199
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,995
and the dust storms are gettin' darker,

200
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:07,353
and there's people fightin' and killin'
and there's kids sick.

201
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,678
Ain't nothin' wrong with your head.

202
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:17,989
I see these shapes and designs,
and I see how to build roads better, and...

203
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,516
them your brushes?

204
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,951
Sure. Yeah.

205
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,594
I知... kind of a painter.

206
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,596
I sure wish I could sit down
and paint all them pictures I see.

207
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:39,751
Sometimes I think I could spend for ever
just paintin' and paintin' all them pictures.

208
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,034
Well... why don't you just take these?

209
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,310
Take 'em? I ain't got no money.

210
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,069
You don't need no money.
Just take 'em. I got plenty more.

211
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,350
Take some of this paint here.

212
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,392
Take those ideas and...

213
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,160
then find yourself someplace where...
where nobody'll bother you.

214
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,272
And just put those things down.

215
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,154
Just put those things down on paper.
You know?

216
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,277
Now bow to the person.
Now bow to the corner.

217
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,356
Join hands to the left.

218
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,550
Do-si-do!

219
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,198
Whoo-hoo!

220
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,995
- Dust storm!
- Dust storm's comin'!

221
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,355
Better get on home, Woody.

222
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,919
- You better get inside, Woody.
- Ok.

223
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,229
Looks like things ain't gonna be
too pleasurable around here.

224
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,669
- It's gonna be a real big 'un.
- Can I help you?

225
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,756
I got it.

226
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,278
Let's move the couch, pa.

227
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,434
Y'all's gonna ruin them things in this dust.

228
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,516
A little dirt won't hurt.

229
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,158
If this train rides me right
I値l be home Saturday night

230
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,750
cos I知 900 miles from my home

231
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:07,032
and I hate to hear
that lonesome whistle blow

232
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,677
it's that long lonesome train
whistlin' down

233
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,511
pawn you my gold diamond ring

234
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,556
mornin', jimmy.

235
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,636
Mornin', Woody.

236
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,956
Well...

237
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,195
got any more dances lined up?

238
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,395
Ain't heard of none.

239
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,470
What about that place over at Cartersville?
They was givin' a dance a month.

240
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,114
Yeah. Used to.

241
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,834
Yeah... well...

242
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,636
take her easy, jimmy.

243
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,039
- Let me give you a push.
- All right there, Woody.

244
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,475
- What do you think it is, Joe?
- I don't know, Woody.

245
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,717
- It's just dust.
- Thanks a lot, though.

246
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,718
It's dust, that's what it is.

247
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,796
Bye, Woody.

248
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:02,077
Seems like things just ain't
goin' so good around here.

249
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:06,434
Not the way they's goin'.

250
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,195
Hi, honey.

251
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,916
Hi, honey.

252
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,676
See you later, Woody.

253
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,310
- Mornin'.
- Get down! Get down, boy!

254
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:52,396
Get down!

255
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,668
- This train goin' to California?
- It's goin' in that direction.

256
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,155
Can't ask for more than that.

257
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:09,559
- You boys are gonna catch this train?
- Yeah.

258
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,910
Mind if I ride along?

259
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,996
No.

260
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,828
How come we're sittin' here so long?

261
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:32,716
Oh.

262
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,195
Welcome aboard, boys.

263
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,754
Welcome, cowboy.

264
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,676
Mind movin' over a little bit there, friend?

265
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,756
Much obliged.

266
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:30,430
- My name's Guthrie.
- Slim Snedeger.

267
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,915
- Slim.
- That there's "po" Steve.

268
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,634
- Howdy, Steve.
- I知 crippled whitey.

269
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,796
- Whitey.
- Crippled whitey, huh?

270
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,673
Crippled whitey is a fight-spotter.

271
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,870
- A fight-spotter?
- Yeah.

272
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:47,118
I can spot a fist fight on the street
three blocks before I come to it.

273
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,437
I can spot a gang fight
an hour before it happens.

274
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,597
That way, I tip off the boys
and they know how to lay their bets.

275
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,712
You got a fight spotted now, whitey?

276
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,796
I got a whopper.

277
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,876
When's it gonna happen?

278
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,315
- Not more than ten minutes.
- Ah, bullshit!

279
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,955
You watch your tongue, you young
jackass, or I値l tear you apart.

280
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:15,632
Hey, whitey, one doesn't start up by itself,
you're gonna whip up one of your own?

281
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,914
When it starts, I値l be sure to bust
a box over your head, fella.

282
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,030
Cantankerous, ain't he?

283
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,593
Yeah.

284
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,792
But it be he's like that sometimes.

285
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,550
Ridin' these boxcars and things can make
you meaner than 52 rattlesnakes.

286
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,196
Beats walkin', though.

287
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,996
Don't it?

288
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,597
Hey!

289
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,915
Don't push me out!

290
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,076
Whitey! Let me go!

291
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,354
Hey, whitey!

292
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,836
Whitey...

293
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,389
hey, we're slowin' down.
Let's jump off this son of a bitch.

294
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,875
- Jump?
- Jump!

295
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,956
- Go ahead, jump!
- Wait a minute.

296
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:22,519
And when you hit the ground, be on your
feet. That way, you won't break your ass.

297
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,476
Come on.

298
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,196
Come on up here.

299
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,276
What's wrong?

300
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,119
My brushes. Damn, I lost my brushes.

301
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,756
You gonna lose your ass. You're hangin'
halfway between heaven and hell.

302
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,836
Come on up here.

303
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,874
Let's move on down the car there.

304
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,230
- Damn!
- Let's move on down.

305
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,479
Them was about the best brushes
money could buy.

306
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,154
You a artist?

307
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,796
I was hopin' to pick up some money
paintin' signs on the way.

308
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,878
I知 pretty good at sign paintin'.

309
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,956
Sign painter, huh?

310
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,311
I expect you gonna do all right
in California.

311
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,396
Know why?

312
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:14,958
Cos they puttin' up signs and buildings
and everything out there.

313
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,918
- You been?
- Who, me? Nah.

314
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,508
But I heard a heap of talk about it.

315
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:27,873
They tell me, California's the place
for some real nice livin'.

316
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,199
That's what I hear.

317
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,551
What are you gonna do
when you get there?

318
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,750
Well...

319
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,835
Whoo!

320
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:46,718
Well, first thing I知 gonna do is take me
a long look at that pacific ocean,

321
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:51,629
cos I been wantin' to see
that booger all my life.

322
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,673
Then I expect I値l ease on down
to one of them fruit orchards

323
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,917
and get me a job, pickin' fruit.

324
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,272
They tell me fruit is just beggin'
to be picked out there.

325
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,356
You know what I mean?

326
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,951
You drop a seed in the ground,
and you blink your eye,

327
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,629
and you got yourself
a tree bustin' with fruit.

328
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,875
Yeah?

329
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,037
Everything a man needs,
right out there in California.

330
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,434
- Know what I mean?
- Everything a man needs?

331
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,516
Yep.

332
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,436
Let's check 'em, boys.

333
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:28,394
Shit! We comin' into Acomita.

334
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:16,279
Come on outta there, you yahoos.
Come on outta there now, dammit!

335
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,311
- Let's go!
- Get outta there, woman.

336
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,396
- No!
- Pull her out.

337
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,715
Hey, you son of a bitch!

338
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,636
Ok, boys.

339
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:05,072
Poor bastard. Ice didn't help this one.
Smells like he's been in there for a week.

340
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,239
You haven't been takin'
full advantage of the railroad facilities.

341
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,195
We want you to ride in full comfort,
so we're gonna put you inside,

342
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,270
where you can stretch out your legs
and rest your heads back on doilies.

343
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,276
Wouldn't that be nice?

344
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,838
- How much money you got?
- A dollar, fifty. I don't know.

345
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:34,988
He can ride all the way to Holden on that.
Write him up a ticket.

346
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,156
How much you got?

347
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:44,994
Don't hear nothin' jinglin',
don't feel nothin' foldin'.

348
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,635
Boy, you appear to be a vagrant.

349
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,877
We have a curfew on vagrants.

350
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,956
Or didn't you know that?

351
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:57,152
I don't believe I did. When is it?

352
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,430
Every hour, on the hour.

353
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,353
Get on your hands and knees, sonny.

354
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:27,118
I could shoot you in the hand if I wanted.
Or in the thigh, in the soft part.

355
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:32,109
Or I could take you out in them weeds
after everybody's gone.

356
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,309
Agh!

357
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,513
Your mother'd wait a long time
for those letters you promised to write.

358
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:45,070
Come on, move on.
Let's get aboard. Come on.

359
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,156
Keep it movin'.

360
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,919
The rest of you,
get your ass down the road.

361
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,319
Come this way again, gentlemen,
and it'll be 30 days. 30 big 'uns.

362
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,829
Move it out!

363
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,950
So long, Guthrie!
See you in California!

364
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,113
Take it easy, slim!

365
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,196
But take it!

366
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:41,516
Howdy, pastor.

367
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,676
My name is Guthrie.

368
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,036
I...

369
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,873
well, have you got any work I could do
for just a small meal of some kind?

370
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:59,516
Well, sir, I would do anything to earn it.

371
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,431
Son, I致e been in the service all my life.

372
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,917
I致e seen thousands of men like you,
who go to work for a meal.

373
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:13,032
However, at this moment
there isn't any work to be done.

374
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:17,711
Therefore, if I were to feed you,
it would be an act of charity.

375
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,190
Which may be all right for the moment,

376
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,278
but could cause harm in the long run.

377
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:31,118
You seem to have retained
your pride and your dignity,

378
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:35,074
since you didn't ask outright
for a free meal.

379
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,430
And that's to your credit.

380
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,350
But to answer your question,
there's no work to be done.

381
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:45,677
And, therefore, you can't earn a meal.

382
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,076
Good luck, son.

383
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:10,515
We been all over. Niagara falls,
Washington DC, New Orleans, Chicago.

384
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,598
Spent a couple of weeks this past winter
in Miami Beach.

385
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:16,837
- Must have been real interestin'.
- You bet it was.

386
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:22,717
Meetin' different people, seein' all the
sights, goin' to the unusual restaurants.

387
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,832
I found out somethin'
about eatin' on my trip.

388
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:30,272
- Really? What was that?
- The more you eat, the more you shit.

389
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,869
A hard-workin' man and brave

390
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,600
he said to the rich
"give your goods to the poor"

391
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,956
and they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

392
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:11,111
Jesus was a man, a carpenter by hand,

393
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,352
his followers, true and brave

394
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:22,590
one dirty little coward
named Judas Iscariot

395
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,915
laid Jesus Christ in his grave

396
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:38,638
put your money away, Guthrie.
It's on the house. You really sing great.

397
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:44,312
You know the one I like the best? The one
you sing about that dead cowboy guy.

398
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:47,273
I like it. It's good.

399
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,949
I wrote that song especially. Just for you.

400
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:56,075
In a pig's ass you did, Guthrie.

401
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:30,950
Just as he's walkin', a man is talkin'.

402
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,150
To who's he talkin'?

403
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,714
The man who's walkin'.

404
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,796
Why is he talkin'?

405
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,636
To keep on walkin'.

406
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,396
Keep on walkin'.

407
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,228
Walkin' and talkin'.
Talkin' and walkin'.

408
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,195
Walkin' and talkin'.
Talkin' and walkin'.

409
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,790
Whoo-ee! California!

410
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,992
Hey, take a look at that. California!

411
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:43,238
Everything a man needs, out there.

412
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:47,592
- Yee-ha!
- Yes, sir, the California state line.

413
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,872
- What's goin' on?
- Looks like some kind of hold-up.

414
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,880
Maybe a accident or somethin'.

415
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:18,110
Accident, hell!
They're turnin' people back.

416
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,792
What's goin' on?

417
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,718
They're checkin' us out,
to see if we got any money.

418
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:39,434
Gotta have $50 to get across the border.

419
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,233
- $50?!
- Yeah, in cash.

420
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:48,151
That's right. Los Angeles police
came out here and set up this blockade.

421
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:53,669
- We that close to Los Angeles?
- Yeah, about 300 miles.

422
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:57,076
Jesus!

423
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,672
What are you gonna do?

424
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,110
Ain't no sense in waitin' in line,
just to get shoved back.

425
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:10,153
I might as well turn back right now.
You comin'?

426
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,832
No. I reckon there's more than one way
to get across the border,

427
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,316
if you don't have a family taggin' along.

428
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,756
Look... why don't you take this?

429
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,396
It ain't no $50,
but you got them kids an' all.

430
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,433
Thanks. I appreciate that, friend.

431
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:38,235
Maybe we'll both be millionaire's sons
next time we meet each other.

432
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,794
- Maybe so.
- I hope so anyway.

433
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,669
- Take care.
- Thank you kindly for the ride.

434
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,316
Howdy.

435
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,876
Hey.

436
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,231
Hey, why don't you come over
and share my bed?

437
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,791
Come on.

438
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,876
Sure.

439
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,912
- Thanks, mister.
- I can't stand chatterin' teeth.

440
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,438
Better watch yourself,
cos when she gets here,

441
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:18,314
she's gonna be movin'
like a turpentined cat.

442
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:22,430
You sure as you know what you're doin'?

443
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:25,358
Them guys won't do nothin'
once she's movin'.

444
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,519
Get us into la 'fore you know it.

445
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:05,154
Ain't this a son of a bitch?
I never seen a train take off...

446
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,151
you got him.

447
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:10,271
That is about as clean
as this wall is gonna get.

448
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,270
Did you get right on top there?

449
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,551
- I did. Where's my chilli?
- It was very greasy over there.

450
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,955
- What's your name?
- Woody.

451
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:21,071
Yah, Woody!

452
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,158
Yes, sir! Best chilli in the city.

453
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,475
Goodbye, fellas.

454
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:30,229
Best in the world...
as far as I知 concerned.

455
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:37,278
- Damn!
- Here, have some onion and crackers.

456
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:40,710
Put lots of onion in it.
Tastes good that way.

457
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:44,594
Look at this mess, huh?
Just one bowl of chilli and a lot of mess.

458
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:52,158
You know where a fella
can get a job hereabouts?

459
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:56,114
- You just come in town?
- Mm-hm. This mornin'.

460
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,357
You better go home.

461
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,789
A chilli and crackers!

462
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,952
- Deadhead.
- Push it down.

463
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:15,197
- You mean let it down?
- You know what I mean.

464
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:19,108
That's as far as it'll go down.
If I let it down, it won't...

465
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,392
- I can't even lift the thing.
- It won't go on the hub.

466
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,353
It won't go. You gotta have it up.

467
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,517
Would you like to just do this yourself?

468
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:31,790
Looks like a mighty stubborn tyre.

469
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,195
Just like everything else.

470
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,756
- Be glad to help.
- We'd sure appreciate it.

471
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:41,836
Yeah.

472
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,749
- This wheel's bent.
- Bent?

473
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,118
Seems like everything in California's bent.

474
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,631
I hope we find somethin' in this place.

475
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,113
Yeah.

476
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:18,630
She just needs milk real soon.

477
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,716
We'll be ok.

478
01:01:06,360 --> 01:01:08,715
What the hell's goin' on here?

479
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,116
How come all these people
are livin' like this?

480
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:15,073
It ain't no different.

481
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,556
It's the goddamn same as all the rest.

482
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,878
Growers, they need
three or four hundred workers.

483
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:28,828
They put out leaflets and posters
and advertise for a thousand,

484
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,235
and 1200 showed up.

485
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,152
They got the first ones that get here
crammed inside them shacks over there.

486
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,795
They're workin' pretty steady.

487
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:49,314
All the rest of us are sittin' on our asses,
hopin' they're gonna need extra workers.

488
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:54,238
Hell, I worked three days
in the last two weeks.

489
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,760
The wages, they doesn't buy...

490
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,916
the wages...

491
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:08,039
I don't know,
makes me sick just talkin' about it.

492
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:18,714
What are we gonna do, then?
We got nothin' left.

493
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:22,356
Ain't got no choice.

494
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:32,712
You're welcome to spend the night
in the truck, if you want.

495
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:42,272
Seems to me somethin'
ought to be done about this.

496
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,516
There's nothin'.

497
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,235
There's always somethin'.

498
01:02:49,360 --> 01:02:55,196
There's been some talk about
formin' a union, goin' on strike.

499
01:02:55,320 --> 01:03:03,238
But... hell, Woody, not many people
can afford to miss a day's work.

500
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,273
No.

501
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:11,676
By the time they call on us to pick,

502
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:15,713
we're more than happy to work
for four cents a bushel.

503
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,596
What'd you say if I took
this little old guitar into town?

504
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,475
Maybe I can pick up a dime or two?

505
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,312
You comin' back?

506
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:48,477
Got no place to sleep,
'cept in your truck.

507
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,239
Hell, yeah, go ahead and take it.

508
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,236
I ain't in too much of a mood
to use it anyway.

509
01:03:56,360 --> 01:03:58,271
Thanks.

510
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,356
See you later.

511
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,593
Tell you what, I値l paint you a new sign
out there for a bowl of that soup.

512
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:16,309
Well, I tell you what, it's not necessary.

513
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,396
The food is free.

514
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,876
Well, suppose I said
I don't want no free food?

515
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:27,078
Well, suppose I said
we don't have any other kind?

516
01:05:31,960 --> 01:05:37,114
Well, I guess... I guess I壇 have to say
"please pass the soup."

517
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,870
Do you play?

518
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:47,956
Yep.

519
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:51,391
I studied piano.

520
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,318
Years ago. I never had the patience.

521
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,396
- That so?
- Yes.

522
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,469
Would you really paint us a sign?

523
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:04,558
- For food?
- For a favour.

524
01:06:05,560 --> 01:06:07,915
I壇 have to think about that.

525
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,116
Uh... we don't have
any paint here right now.

526
01:06:13,240 --> 01:06:15,879
Then how would I paint a sign?

527
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,355
I could bring some tomorrow.

528
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,677
Yeah, well, I値l see if I can come back.

529
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:28,476
Thanks for the soup.

530
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,355
Red and white paint is pretty nice.

531
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:42,396
Red and white.

532
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,589
Well, I was down in the henhouse

533
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:16,676
on my knees

534
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,634
I thought I heard a chicken sneeze

535
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:25,470
it was only a rooster
sayin' his prayers

536
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:28,990
thankin' his gods for the hens upstairs

537
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,470
just takin' it easy

538
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,239
lady, what'd you say?!

539
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:52,149
Hit him, bill!

540
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,358
Quiet down!
Now, we need 30 more pickers for today.

541
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:08,597
Quiet! Quiet down!

542
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:12,917
We're payin' four cents a bushel.

543
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,190
Four cents.

544
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,710
Line up over here by the gate
in single file.

545
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,876
Stop pushin' over there!

546
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:50,429
Keep on shovin',
and we won't take anybody.

547
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:11,156
Cheapskate!

548
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,875
Bastards.

549
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,956
Goddamn bastards!

550
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:35,355
- That's all they're takin', them 30 people?
- That's all they ever take.

551
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:41,555
Well, hell, why do you stay here? One
of them other camps may be hirin' more.

552
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:45,958
It don't make no difference.
I mean, they all work the same.

553
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:49,117
It's the fourth one we've been to, and...

554
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,836
they's all alike.

555
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,596
All of 'em is bastards.

556
01:10:14,520 --> 01:10:16,476
That's beautiful!

557
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,234
- I had a terrible time with the one I did.
- Yeah, it looked like you did.

558
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,990
I really appreciate it.

559
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,714
Can I get you something to eat?

560
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:29,479
Not here.

561
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:31,750
What do you mean, not here?

562
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:37,436
Well,

563
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,916
you could fix me dinner at your place.

564
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:47,033
No, I couldn't do that.

565
01:10:47,160 --> 01:10:49,276
Why not? You got a man?

566
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,714
No. My husband died.

567
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:57,236
- Well, what's your name?
- Pauline.

568
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:59,316
Mine's Woody.

569
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:04,915
- How about next Sunday?
- Woody, I知 not gonna fix you dinner.

570
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:06,996
Why not?

571
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,235
Because I just can't.

572
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:20,233
Yeah, course you can't.

573
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,953
- I can't say as I blame you.
- That's not the reason.

574
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,117
Well, it's a pretty good reason.

575
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:31,196
Listen,

576
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,359
give it a couple of hours
before you handle it, ok?

577
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:54,192
Way down in Columbus, Georgia

578
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,552
wanna be back in Tennessee

579
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:04,315
go and leave me if you want to

580
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,274
never let me cross your mind

581
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:14,191
if in your heart you love another

582
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:18,393
leave, little darlin', I don't mind

583
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,954
thinkin' about my blue-eyed sally

584
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,916
pretty little gal that I left behind

585
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:34,592
way down in Columbus stockade

586
01:12:34,720 --> 01:12:39,271
wanna go back to Tennessee

587
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,793
way down in Columbus, Georgia

588
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,196
wanna be back in Tennessee

589
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:59,029
- it's Ozark!
- Who's Ozark?

590
01:12:59,160 --> 01:13:04,996
- Ozark blue sings on the radio.
- Sometimes he comes to entertain us.

591
01:13:09,120 --> 01:13:12,590
- Hey, Ozark.
- Hi, how are ya, sis?

592
01:13:12,720 --> 01:13:14,915
I swear, you get prettier every day.

593
01:13:15,040 --> 01:13:19,795
Hey, Jed, look over there and see what
I brought for you guys. Open that door.

594
01:13:21,160 --> 01:13:24,516
You get to eat it
without pickin' it for a change.

595
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:29,839
I can see that you haven't been doin'
like I said and organisin'.

596
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:33,191
You're still lettin' those bosses
pay you nothin'

597
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,959
for bustin' your behinds
in those fields all day.

598
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:41,916
Now, the only way I値l do any singin' today
is if we all get together and shout "union".

599
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,918
Now, one, two, three...

600
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:46,758
union!

601
01:13:51,200 --> 01:13:53,156
That was pitiful.

602
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:59,429
Now, we're gonna try it once more, and if
more of you don't join in, I知 leavin'.

603
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:00,515
Ah!

604
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:04,269
We're gonna try it again,
and I wanna hear more of you joinin' in.

605
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:09,235
- Now, one, two, three...
- union!

606
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,599
All right.

607
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:15,679
Now, it wasn't perfect...
but I reckon it's a start.

608
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,069
Let's have a little pickin' and singin'.

609
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:21,156
Yeah!

610
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,357
Long-haired preachers
come out every night

611
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:30,836
try to tell us what's wrong
and what's right

612
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:33,793
but when asked about somethin' to eat

613
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,878
they will answerin' voices so sweet:

614
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,798
You're gonna eat by and by

615
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,597
when you learn how to cook and to fry

616
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:46,154
chop some wood, it'll do you good

617
01:14:46,920 --> 01:14:49,229
there'll be pie in the sky when you die

618
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:50,839
that's a lie!

619
01:14:50,960 --> 01:14:53,758
There'll be starvation...

620
01:14:53,880 --> 01:14:56,633
hi, neighbours! Come on over!
Come on over.

621
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,197
Now, I want you to listen to this verse.
It makes sense.

622
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:06,790
Workin' men of all countries, unite

623
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,037
side by side for freedom we will fight

624
01:15:10,160 --> 01:15:13,391
when this world and its wealth
we have gained

625
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:16,273
to the grafters we'll sing this refrain

626
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,150
everybody!

627
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:19,953
You will eat by and by

628
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:23,831
in that glorious land above the sky

629
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,713
work and pray, live on hay

630
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:30,955
there'll be pie in the sky when you die

631
01:15:31,080 --> 01:15:32,877
that's a dirty lie!

632
01:15:36,640 --> 01:15:40,428
- One more!
- I値l tell you somethin' that's even better.

633
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:43,711
I want everybody here
that plays an instrument

634
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:46,149
to get that instrument
and come back here.

635
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:49,716
We're gonna have the damnedest
hoedown you've ever seen!

636
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,512
Round, round, old Joe Clark
round, round, I say

637
01:16:25,640 --> 01:16:28,871
I知 gonna walk ten thousand miles
to hear them fiddles play

638
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,992
round, round, old Joe Clark
round, round, I say

639
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,069
I知 gonna walk ten thousand miles
to hear them fiddles play

640
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,958
round, round, old Joe Clark
round, round, I say

641
01:16:45,080 --> 01:16:50,029
I知 gonna walk ten thousand miles
to hear them fiddles play

642
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:55,671
down in the valley

643
01:16:55,800 --> 01:17:00,316
valley so low

644
01:17:01,520 --> 01:17:07,390
late in the evenin'

645
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,389
hear the wind blow

646
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:18,558
hear the wind blow

647
01:17:18,920 --> 01:17:24,597
hear the wind blow

648
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:30,397
late in the evenin'

649
01:17:30,520 --> 01:17:35,640
hear the wind blow

650
01:17:36,280 --> 01:17:41,752
roses love sunshine

651
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:46,158
violets love dew

652
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:53,317
angels in heaven

653
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:57,149
know I love you

654
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,596
write me a letter

655
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:08,275
send it by mail

656
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,709
let's move these people
back in their shacks.

657
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,834
Send it in care of

658
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:19,873
Birmingham jail

659
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:25,633
Birmingham jail

660
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:31,508
Birmingham jail

661
01:18:31,640 --> 01:18:36,236
send it in care of

662
01:18:36,360 --> 01:18:39,352
so, though it's been good to know you

663
01:18:39,480 --> 01:18:43,075
this dusty old dust storm
is gettin' my goat

664
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,792
and I got to be driftin' along

665
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,716
driftin' along

666
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,436
- real good. Real good.
- Yeah. Too many strings on it.

667
01:18:57,560 --> 01:19:00,154
Here.

668
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,238
- It might help.
- It might at that.

669
01:19:09,800 --> 01:19:13,156
This train's bound for glory, this train

670
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:18,275
this train is bound for glory, this train

671
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,796
whoo-whoo!

672
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,035
This train don't carry no gamblers,
this train

673
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:31,197
this train is bound for glory, this train

674
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:36,359
this train is bound for glory, this train

675
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,634
this train is bound for glory, no one
aboard but the righteous and the holy

676
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:44,639
this train is bound for glory, this train

677
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,115
this train don't carry no liars, this train

678
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:52,909
this train don't carry no liars, this train

679
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,869
this train don't carry no liars
oh, none of those midnight flyers

680
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,356
this train's bound for glory, this train

681
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,954
this train don't carry no con men,
this train

682
01:20:06,080 --> 01:20:10,312
don't you know that, this train
don't carry no con men? This train

683
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,556
hey, this train don't carry no con men

684
01:20:12,680 --> 01:20:14,910
none of those wheeler dealers,
here and gone men

685
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:18,077
this train is bound for glory, this train

686
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:22,276
this train is bound for glory, this train

687
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:26,919
this train is bound for glory, this train

688
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:30,396
this train's bound for glory, no one
aboard but the righteous and the holy

689
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,592
this train is bound for glory...

690
01:20:33,720 --> 01:20:36,439
what the goddamn hell
do you think you're doin'?

691
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:38,039
This train...

692
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:40,754
what the hell does it look like we're doin'?

693
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:43,394
I warned you to stay
away from here, Blue.

694
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,113
Yeah, well, I forgot.

695
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,197
Let's get outta here.

696
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:57,316
- Ok, that's it!
- Hey!

697
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:00,875
Let's move outta here.

698
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,836
Get in the car!

699
01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:22,159
Let him get through, everybody!

700
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,840
- Get him off!
- Get him off that car.

701
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:31,996
Get him off the car!

702
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:35,311
Union! Union!

703
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:41,310
- Union!
- Union! Union! Union!

704
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:01,749
This sort of thing happen every time
you come out to entertain folks?

705
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:07,193
Sure seems like it. As long as I知 gettin'
those goons riled up, I知 doin' my job.

706
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:10,790
I値l tell you, those boys
don't seem to like you too much.

707
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,071
Yeah? Well, they didn't seem
to like you too much either.

708
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:16,316
I wasn't even tryin'.

709
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,510
Maybe you ought to start.

710
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:20,790
- Start what?
- Tryin'.

711
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:22,638
Tryin' what?

712
01:22:27,840 --> 01:22:30,957
You sure as hell don't look like much.

713
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,674
How do you sound?

714
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:38,078
- Makes me happy.
- Wait till you hear him, Mr. Locke.

715
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:41,158
<i>Ok, Guthrie, let's hear something.</i>

716
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:45,396
I壇 like to sing a song about the place...

717
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,876
<i>Guthrie, let's just get on with it, please.</i>

718
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:55,673
...place where I grew up. It's called "in
those Oklahoma hills where I was born".

719
01:23:00,680 --> 01:23:05,037
Many a month has come and gone
since I wandered from my home

720
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:08,470
in those Oklahoma hills
where I was born

721
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:11,796
many a page of life has turned

722
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,956
many a lesson I have learned

723
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:17,516
and I feel like in those hills I still belong

724
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,270
way down yonder on the Indian nation

725
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:23,356
Ridin' my pony on the reservation

726
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:26,836
in those Oklahoma hills
where I was born

727
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,151
way down yonder on the Indian nation

728
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:32,316
the cowboy's life is my occupation

729
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:35,398
in those Oklahoma hills
where I was born

730
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,071
well, as I stand here in la

731
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:40,394
many a mile...

732
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,988
<i>ok, Guthrie. We'll give you a try.</i>

733
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:46,317
<i>- ...my pony through the draw
- uh, Guthrie!</i>

734
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,237
Where the oak and blackjack trees

735
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:51,432
kiss the playful prairie breeze
and I feel...

736
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,518
<i>Guthrie! You have the job.</i>

737
01:23:56,080 --> 01:23:58,071
Way down yonder on the Indian nation

738
01:23:58,200 --> 01:24:00,350
Ridin' my pony on the reservation

739
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:03,631
in those Oklahoma hills
where I was born

740
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,276
way down yonder on the Indian nation

741
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:09,436
the cowboy's life is my occupation

742
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:12,597
in those Oklahoma hills
where I was born

743
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,917
here's an advance, Guthrie.

744
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:20,830
I... I want you to go out
and get a set of decent clothes.

745
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:23,714
And...

746
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:26,400
and show up here next Thursday!

747
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,476
At 20 bucks a week.

748
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,589
Yahoo!

749
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:01,993
Since I知 almost respectable now, maybe
you can ask me to your house for dinner.

750
01:25:02,120 --> 01:25:05,510
- That's not why I didn't ask you.
- Well, what is why?

751
01:25:05,640 --> 01:25:07,915
I don't know you.

752
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,996
Well...

753
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,516
I think I壇 like chicken, with dressin'.

754
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:39,275
So go to sleep, my weary hobo

755
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:46,991
let the ton drift slowly by

756
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:54,433
and can't you hear
the steel rails hummin'?

757
01:25:56,760 --> 01:26:02,278
That's the hobo's lullaby

758
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,795
folks, we got a real treat for you tonight.

759
01:26:07,920 --> 01:26:12,198
We got an old boy from Oklahoma
who not only sings songs, he writes 'em.

760
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,790
And his name is Woodrow Wilson Guthrie,
but we just call him Woody.

761
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,469
And his song is called
"I ain't got no home".

762
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,871
Well, I ain't got no home

763
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,275
I知 just ramblin' around

764
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:36,269
I知 a hard-workin' ramblin' man
and I go from town to town

765
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,313
police make it hard,
hard everywhere I go

766
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:44,879
and I ain't got no home
in this world any more

767
01:26:46,640 --> 01:26:48,232
<i>I used to work for shares</i>

768
01:26:48,360 --> 01:26:50,715
<i>seems like I was always poor</i>

769
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:55,315
<i>I laid my crops right at the banker's door</i>

770
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:57,635
<i>my wife took up and died</i>

771
01:26:57,760 --> 01:26:59,876
<i>on the cabin floor</i>

772
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:02,878
<i>I ain't got no home any more</i>

773
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:29,393
- howdy, Ozark.
- Hi, neighbours!

774
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:34,718
- Can I talk to you for just a minute?
- You sure can.

775
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:40,995
If I had to drag my tail home with 80 cents
in my pocket after workin' all day like this,

776
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:43,759
I壇 begin to wonder
if somethin' wasn't wrong.

777
01:27:43,880 --> 01:27:48,670
It'd be nice if you had enough money to
put food on the table at the end of the day.

778
01:27:48,800 --> 01:27:53,635
Did you ever stop to wonder if you could
do something about the way you live?

779
01:27:53,760 --> 01:27:56,399
Because you can, friends

780
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:58,476
Woody!

781
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:08,518
I知 gonna get you!
Get outta the valley!

782
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:15,673
You sons of bitches,
stay out of this valley!

783
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,111
You people, get back to work!

784
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,471
Union! Union! Union!

785
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,950
I been ridin' in fast rattlers
I thought you knowed

786
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,470
I been ridin' in flat wheelers
way down the road

787
01:28:34,600 --> 01:28:37,990
I been ridin' in blind passengers,
dead enders, kickin' up cinders

788
01:28:38,120 --> 01:28:41,078
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord

789
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,517
I been walkin' that Lincoln Highway
I thought you knowed

790
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,916
I been kickin' that 66
way down the road

791
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:53,951
I got a heavy load and a worryin' mind

792
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:55,593
I知 lookin' for a woman
that's hard to find

793
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,473
I been havin' some hard travellin', Lord

794
01:28:59,680 --> 01:29:03,389
- Whoo!
- All right! Let's hear it here.

795
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,476
Now, the farm workers need your help.

796
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:44,390
I was expectin' the mayor! I thought
this was city hall there for a second.

797
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,670
Come on in, Woody.

798
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,997
How much you get paid
for workin' at that place anyhow?

799
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:52,076
I don't get paid.

800
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,156
I知 a volunteer.

801
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:00,956
Excuse me,
but could I ask you a question?

802
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:05,316
Sure. What?

803
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:10,351
Well, don't you get embarrassed ever?

804
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:15,078
"Embarrassed ever" about what?

805
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:23,639
Well, don't you get just a little bit
embarrassed about havin' so much,

806
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:26,718
when so many people got nothin'?

807
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:33,478
Well, I don't think "embarrassed".

808
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:40,675
I am very sorry that there are
so many people who have nothing.

809
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:43,876
Sure.

810
01:30:44,000 --> 01:30:45,956
Course you are.

811
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,837
Sorry don't get the hay in.

812
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:58,159
So you ladle 'em up the soup
and dish out a little charity?

813
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,759
Well, we're not all as gifted as you are.

814
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,236
Some of us just do the best we can.

815
01:31:07,040 --> 01:31:10,157
Pauline, let me tell you somethin'.

816
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:12,236
When i...

817
01:31:13,440 --> 01:31:17,274
well, when I was on the road,
I met a lot of different kinds of people.

818
01:31:17,400 --> 01:31:20,312
There was bums and freeloaders.

819
01:31:20,440 --> 01:31:23,876
There was families that was torn apart.

820
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:29,313
And poor people that just was achin'
for some kind of work.

821
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:34,036
And men that are just tryin'
to get somewhere. Anywhere.

822
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:39,558
They all got somethin' in common,

823
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:44,435
that every one of them
had somethin' to give me.

824
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,874
Then you meet some man
that's got some money,

825
01:31:48,000 --> 01:31:53,313
and he'll be... tied up and anxious.

826
01:31:54,040 --> 01:31:58,431
The human thing is just gone.
It's just gone, cos he's afraid.

827
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,552
Afraid that he's gonna lose somethin'.

828
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:06,515
He's afraid to smile, cos somebody's
gonna swipe his teeth out his mouth.

829
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:09,473
You don't believe that
just because a person has money

830
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,717
that he completely loses touch?

831
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,274
Because that's wrong.

832
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:20,599
I feel as alive and human as anyone else.

833
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:27,514
That don't give me nothin'.

834
01:32:28,120 --> 01:32:32,477
What the hell am I supposed
to give you, Woody?

835
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:35,114
Just why did you come here?

836
01:32:35,240 --> 01:32:38,391
I just liked the way you looked, and...

837
01:32:41,120 --> 01:32:43,429
I thought you had possibilities.

838
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:47,596
Possibilities.

839
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:51,310
Well, what must you think now?

840
01:32:52,000 --> 01:32:57,916
I think I知 lookin' at a... rich person.

841
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:01,036
So?

842
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,038
So, you're the only one
that's ever looked back.

843
01:33:06,560 --> 01:33:10,269
You know, Samson went out walkin'...

844
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:15,510
and slew a lion with his bare hands.

845
01:33:17,320 --> 01:33:19,880
But it took

846
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,470
a pretty woman

847
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:27,798
to show Samson he was just a lamb

848
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:37,276
come on, we haven't got all day.

849
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:40,710
I have a reputation to uphold.

850
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:45,072
If anybody catches us here,
they're gonna be a little bit angry at us.

851
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:49,869
Doesn't have to look like
Rembrandt, did it?

852
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:53,197
- Next time I知 paintin' the sign.
- It ain't bad.

853
01:33:53,320 --> 01:33:56,392
There ain't no sense in doin' it
if somebody can't read it.

854
01:33:56,520 --> 01:33:59,796
- Might as well paint signs white.
- You never been caught.

855
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:04,789
I wouldn't wanna be caught by them guys
with a sign that looked as awful as that.

856
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:09,835
B- e-l-l-l-e.

857
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:12,235
There we go. S.

858
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:14,273
Ok.

859
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:17,358
"Come on..." you can read that.
Come on, let's go.

860
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:22,474
Good evenin', y'all. This is Woody, talkin'
to you while Ozark痴 catchin' his breath.

861
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:27,037
I壇 like to dedicate a song tonight
to all you folks sittin' out there

862
01:34:27,160 --> 01:34:29,799
in them fruit-pickin' camps.

863
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,559
I know you're squattin' there, hungry,

864
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:35,638
either too darn hot or too darn cold,

865
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,397
and wonderin' if you
should have ever left home.

866
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:45,435
This here's for y'all.

867
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,269
If we don't organise,
if we don't unite in our struggle,

868
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,789
those growers will have us
on our knees for ever!

869
01:34:51,920 --> 01:34:54,150
- Let's strike.
- We gotta work.

870
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:58,319
- We gotta strike!
- But our families? How are we gonna eat?

871
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:02,035
There are donations of food and clothing
coming from all over the state.

872
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:05,755
- We don't want charity, we want jobs.
- Listen. Listen to me!

873
01:35:05,880 --> 01:35:09,839
There ain't nobody gonna get any
damn jobs until you start to listen to us.

874
01:35:09,960 --> 01:35:12,394
- You're nothin' but commies!
- Sit down!

875
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:14,238
- You sit down!
- No.

876
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:17,909
Now's not the time to sit down,
but to stand up for your rights.

877
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:19,996
Sit down and shut up.

878
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,875
Please listen to us.
We're telling you the truth.

879
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:29,036
Hold it! Please, hold it.

880
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,038
Just a tune of "free red range".

881
01:35:34,440 --> 01:35:38,035
There once was a union maid
who never was afraid

882
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:39,718
of the goons and the ginks
and the company finks

883
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,558
and the deputy sheriffs
who made the raids

884
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:45,116
she went to the union hall
when a meetinn' it was called

885
01:35:45,240 --> 01:35:48,277
and when the company boys
came round she always stood her ground

886
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,551
oh, you can't scare me
I知 stickin' to the union

887
01:35:51,680 --> 01:35:55,468
I知 stickin' to the union
I知 stickin' to the union

888
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:58,512
oh, you can't scare me
I知 stickin' to the union

889
01:35:58,640 --> 01:36:02,235
I知 stickin' to the union
till the day I die

890
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:05,909
well, the union maid was wise
to the tricks of the company spies

891
01:36:06,040 --> 01:36:07,678
she was never gonna be fooled
by the company stools

892
01:36:07,800 --> 01:36:09,392
she'd always organised the guys

893
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,671
she always got her way
when she struck for higher pay

894
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,279
she'd show her card
to the national guard

895
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,594
and this is what she'd say:

896
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:19,030
Oh, you can't scare me
I知 stickin' to the union

897
01:36:19,160 --> 01:36:22,516
I知 stickin' to the union
I知 stickin' to the union

898
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:25,757
oh, you can't scare me
I知 stickin' to the union

899
01:36:25,880 --> 01:36:28,394
I知 stickin' to the union
till the day I die

900
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:29,316
everybody!

901
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,432
Oh, you can't scare me
I知 stickin' to the union

902
01:36:32,560 --> 01:36:35,950
I知 stickin' to the union
I知 stickin' to the union

903
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:39,038
oh, you can't scare me
I知 stickin' to the union

904
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:43,312
I知 stickin' to the union
till the day I die

905
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:45,317
- outside!
- Get off me.

906
01:36:45,440 --> 01:36:48,000
- I said, outside!
- Get...

907
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:50,076
...I知 sti...

908
01:36:51,440 --> 01:36:53,396
excuse me.

909
01:37:14,600 --> 01:37:17,672
Do you ever think of becoming a painter?

910
01:37:17,800 --> 01:37:23,238
I reckon I壇 get busted up doin' that
just as easy as anythin' else.

911
01:37:25,360 --> 01:37:27,316
I "reckon" you would.

912
01:37:32,720 --> 01:37:34,676
Woody?

913
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:39,756
- Woody!
- Uh-huh?

914
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,110
I知 happy.

915
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,197
I知 really happy that I know you.

916
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,232
Yeah.

917
01:38:30,480 --> 01:38:32,914
Yeah, what?

918
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:39,234
Yeah... I知 married.

919
01:38:43,160 --> 01:38:46,118
I got a wife and I got kids.

920
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:59,792
I guess I could have lied to you before,

921
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:05,040
but I can't lie to you
now you're startin' to care.

922
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,035
I was carin' too, Pauline.

923
01:39:18,600 --> 01:39:21,558
Just... bein' around you...

924
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,516
knowin' you.

925
01:39:52,920 --> 01:39:56,356
Most of this mail is favourable, Woody.

926
01:39:56,480 --> 01:39:59,074
Yes, very favourable indeed.

927
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:03,193
I didn't have no idea
that many people was listenin'.

928
01:40:04,560 --> 01:40:07,279
Well, apparently they are.

929
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:13,077
Woody, I知 gonna give you and Memphis
sue your own half-hour show, every night.

930
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:15,794
- How does that sound?
- Whoo-ee!

931
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:17,399
Now!

932
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,956
And, of course,
that means more money too.

933
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,674
Say, 35 a week?

934
01:40:23,800 --> 01:40:25,756
No.

935
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,870
- However...
- however, what?

936
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:36,674
However, you now have
new sponsors, Woody.

937
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:41,954
They've insisted there be no controversial
material on their programme.

938
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:45,789
So just stick to the songs
that have been out and around for a while,

939
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:48,718
and everything'll be fine.

940
01:40:48,840 --> 01:40:52,958
Does that mean I can't do
my own songs on the show?

941
01:40:53,080 --> 01:40:55,833
Of course you can sing your own songs.

942
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:58,758
As long as it doesn't get anybody riled up.

943
01:40:59,400 --> 01:41:02,119
That sure sounds ok with me, Mr. Locke.

944
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:05,476
Um...

945
01:41:06,680 --> 01:41:08,193
sure.

946
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:11,596
Guess it sounds pretty ok to me too.

947
01:41:11,720 --> 01:41:15,633
Fine. And we'll start on Monday, let's say?

948
01:41:44,360 --> 01:41:45,839
Operator?

949
01:41:45,960 --> 01:41:49,873
I壇 like to talk to Mary Guthrie
in pampas, Texas.

950
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:54,958
You'll have to get a hold of Mr. Jenkins,
and he'll go and get her.

951
01:41:55,080 --> 01:41:58,038
It's just so good to hear your voice.

952
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:04,990
I知 gonna send you the money,
and you just come on out here.

953
01:42:05,120 --> 01:42:08,476
And I値l find you a little house
we can live in.

954
01:42:08,600 --> 01:42:12,832
Oh, sure, honey.
Just like you always talked about.

955
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:15,434
I love you.

956
01:42:33,800 --> 01:42:37,190
Hey, Woody. Look at that.

957
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:39,675
- What is that?
- A field school.

958
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,109
- What do you think?
- Sure.

959
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:47,439
About music, the wonderful thing is
you don't have to know how to play.

960
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:50,597
To make music you just sing.

961
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:54,269
You just go ahead and sing
any song you wanna sing.

962
01:42:54,400 --> 01:42:58,439
You can make up a song
and just sing it to yourself.

963
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,154
You can just go ahead
and sing it out screamin' loud.

964
01:43:01,280 --> 01:43:05,990
You can sing about your troubles,
or you can sing about your happiness.

965
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:11,319
You can sing about your teacher,
or you can sing about the crop duster.

966
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,118
There's singin' in all of us.

967
01:43:15,240 --> 01:43:17,470
You just gotta learn to let it come on out.

968
01:43:21,200 --> 01:43:25,830
Well, you stick out your little hand
to every woman, kid and man

969
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:29,953
and you wave it up and down
and howdy-do

970
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,719
and you wave it up and down
and howdy-do

971
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:35,636
I feel glad when you feel good

972
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,796
you brighten up my neighbourhood

973
01:43:37,920 --> 01:43:41,674
with a do-de-di-de-de-de
howdy-do, howdy-do

974
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:44,758
with a howdy, ho-di, howdy, howdy-do

975
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:50,150
he has every right to set down limits.

976
01:43:50,280 --> 01:43:52,714
He's not gonna allow
preachin' on your show.

977
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:55,149
I suppose you're right.

978
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:59,592
<i>But they got a Sunday mornin' gospel
hour every night, and he sure preaches.</i>

979
01:43:59,720 --> 01:44:04,748
That's what Locke痴 payin' him to do.
He's payin' you to entertain.

980
01:44:04,880 --> 01:44:06,836
What would you do?

981
01:44:06,960 --> 01:44:09,394
- I壇 do just like he said.
- You would?

982
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:13,229
Because that's how I make my livin'.
That's how I eat.

983
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:19,036
It don't have nothin' to do with comin' out
to the fields, doin' the benefits or nothin'.

984
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,310
You can separate it, just like that?

985
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:24,352
I can separate it, just like that.

986
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:29,551
Drop whatever you are doin'

987
01:44:29,640 --> 01:44:32,757
stop your work and worry too

988
01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:35,440
sit right down and take it easy

989
01:44:35,560 --> 01:44:38,836
here comes Woody and Memphis Sue

990
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:44,518
you just drop a card or letter

991
01:44:44,640 --> 01:44:47,757
we will sing a song for you

992
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:51,192
easy-goin' country people

993
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:58,795
plain old Woody and Memphis Sue

994
01:44:58,920 --> 01:45:03,869
good evening to you all. Tonight Woody
and I have 30 minutes of your favourites.

995
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:06,798
We're gonna start off
with "Cimarron spoonin"'.

996
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:08,433
One, two...

997
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:11,711
I just decided to sing somethin' else.

998
01:45:13,640 --> 01:45:18,111
Well, lots of folks back east they say
they're leaving town most every day

999
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:23,758
and they're tryin' to beat their dusty way
to the California line

1000
01:45:23,880 --> 01:45:28,715
well, across the desert sands they roll
tryin' to get out of that old dust bowl

1001
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,197
and they think they're headin' for
a sugar bowl, but here is what they find

1002
01:45:33,320 --> 01:45:37,199
cos the police at port of entry say:

1003
01:45:37,320 --> 01:45:41,472
You're number 14,000 for today

1004
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,275
and if you ain't got do re mi, boy

1005
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:49,112
if you ain't got the do re mi

1006
01:45:50,000 --> 01:45:53,515
you better go back home
to beautiful Texas

1007
01:45:53,640 --> 01:45:57,872
Oklahoma, Georgia, Kansas,
Tennessee, South Dakota

1008
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:01,117
California is the garden of Eden

1009
01:46:02,720 --> 01:46:06,156
a paradise to live in or to see

1010
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:10,239
but, believe it or not,
you won't find it so hot

1011
01:46:10,360 --> 01:46:12,555
if you ain't got...

1012
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:16,832
Locke talked to me, and he is ticked off.

1013
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:19,269
I expected that.

1014
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:21,436
Yeah, well, he said that from now on

1015
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:26,793
you have to make a list each week of
all the songs you're plannin' on singin'.

1016
01:46:26,920 --> 01:46:30,230
He might as well fire me, then,
cos I ain't makin' no list.

1017
01:46:30,360 --> 01:46:32,794
Dammit, Woody,
don't mess up this job.

1018
01:46:32,920 --> 01:46:35,388
God knows what'll happen to you
if you get...

1019
01:46:35,520 --> 01:46:38,990
will you stop splashin'
when I知 tryin' to talk to you?

1020
01:46:39,120 --> 01:46:42,510
You stop it too! Now, dammit,
that ain't funny! Stop it!

1021
01:46:58,960 --> 01:47:02,873
- Ain't it somethin'?
- The whole city is somethin'.

1022
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:06,709
- You've only seen a bit of it, Mary.
- You know what we ought to do?

1023
01:47:06,840 --> 01:47:09,912
Get a picnic together
and take the girls down to the beach.

1024
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,156
That'd be sometime else

1025
01:47:12,280 --> 01:47:17,070
me and Mary ain't seen each other
for a few months. Understand?

1026
01:47:17,200 --> 01:47:20,317
Oh, yeah, right.
You need some help with those?

1027
01:47:20,440 --> 01:47:22,556
No, I can handle it ok.

1028
01:47:22,680 --> 01:47:25,558
- Thanks for the ride, Ozark.
- You bet.

1029
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:28,717
Ok, honey, let me show you the inside.

1030
01:47:36,280 --> 01:47:38,236
Huh?

1031
01:47:43,400 --> 01:47:46,153
Come here, let me show you this.

1032
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:49,198
- Oh!
- Electric.

1033
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:51,276
A refrigerator!

1034
01:47:57,480 --> 01:48:03,316
- Let me show you the bedroom.
- I ain't finished lookin' at the kitchen.

1035
01:48:05,720 --> 01:48:07,676
Oh, my god.

1036
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,156
Our own bedroom.

1037
01:48:22,640 --> 01:48:24,232
Oh!

1038
01:48:24,360 --> 01:48:26,555
Momma's pin.

1039
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:30,317
Whoo-ee!

1040
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:32,396
Oh, you!

1041
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:36,316
Whoo-ee!

1042
01:48:36,440 --> 01:48:39,750
It's so pretty, Woody. It's so perfect.

1043
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:43,754
To celebrate, say "whoo-ee".

1044
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:46,075
No! I don't want to.

1045
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:48,191
- Go ahead and do it.
- No.

1046
01:48:48,320 --> 01:48:51,551
Go ahead. Or I値l tickle you.
Tickle you here.

1047
01:48:51,680 --> 01:48:53,875
All right. Whoo-ee.

1048
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:58,790
Ain't you ticklish no more?

1049
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,434
Really do it. Come on. Come on.

1050
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:04,028
Ok!

1051
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:05,912
Whoo-ee!

1052
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:08,833
Whoo-ee!

1053
01:49:12,080 --> 01:49:15,197
- Hey, we have wet shoes!
- Yeah!

1054
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:27,593
- I think I sounded awful.
- You were great, Sue.

1055
01:49:27,720 --> 01:49:29,711
- I wasn't great.
- You were.

1056
01:49:29,840 --> 01:49:33,150
Mr. Guthrie, excuse me.
My name's baker. I知 an agent.

1057
01:49:33,280 --> 01:49:37,910
I know you're working without a contract.
If you would be willing to travel a bit,

1058
01:49:38,040 --> 01:49:41,476
I think I could double,
maybe triple, what you're earning.

1059
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:45,513
- How would you do that?
- Better shows, for one thing.

1060
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:49,076
I think that I could wangle you
a coast-to-coast broadcast.

1061
01:49:49,200 --> 01:49:53,876
I mean, I know a lot of important people
that I would like to talk to about you.

1062
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,514
Well, I値l think it over.

1063
01:49:56,640 --> 01:49:59,029
Well, ok. I mean,
I don't wanna press you.

1064
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:03,950
Why don't I come back when I致e got
something in the works for you?

1065
01:50:04,080 --> 01:50:05,911
Sure.

1066
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:09,669
Mr. Guthrie, you're gonna be on your way
before you know it.

1067
01:50:09,800 --> 01:50:13,759
Hello, baker. Woody, just a minute,
please. I wanna talk to you.

1068
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:17,233
Um...

1069
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:20,272
I haven't seen any list yet.

1070
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,595
- List?
- Yes.

1071
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:25,518
The list of songs that
you're scheduled to do next week.

1072
01:50:25,640 --> 01:50:29,428
Oh, yeah. I ain't... wrote it yet.

1073
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:34,509
Well, I need the list, Woody,
because the sponsors are insist...

1074
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:46,836
what the hell is that?

1075
01:50:48,400 --> 01:50:50,595
It's an artichoke.

1076
01:50:50,720 --> 01:50:52,676
An artichoke?

1077
01:50:54,560 --> 01:50:57,632
What do you do with it?

1078
01:50:57,760 --> 01:50:59,716
You eat it.

1079
01:51:02,080 --> 01:51:04,753
Damnedest thing I ever seen.

1080
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,236
Don't look too appetisin', do it?

1081
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:13,036
- I gets paid to pick 'em, not to eat 'em.
- I guess you are.

1082
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:17,756
Bet they don't pay you much for pickin'
them ugly old things either, do they?

1083
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:22,192
- I don't get much.
- Do you ever think about all that stoopin'?

1084
01:51:22,320 --> 01:51:25,437
For just pennies?

1085
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:35,838
You one of those union men? You one
of these fellas talkin' about a strike?

1086
01:51:37,400 --> 01:51:40,119
I talk about whatever it is that works.

1087
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:44,873
I got no time to talk to you, mister!

1088
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:52,954
We died 'neath your trees
and we died in your bushes

1089
01:51:53,960 --> 01:51:58,158
both sides of the river
we died just the same

1090
01:52:00,200 --> 01:52:04,591
is this the best way
we can grow big orchards?

1091
01:52:05,360 --> 01:52:09,831
Is this the best way
we can grow our good fruit?

1092
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:15,073
To fall dry leaves
that rot on my topsoil

1093
01:52:15,880 --> 01:52:20,829
and to be called by no name
except deportees

1094
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:23,632
goodbye, my Juan

1095
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,671
goodbye, Rosalita

1096
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:31,231
<i>adios, mis amigos Jess y Maria</i>

1097
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:36,994
you won't have your names
when you ride the big airplane

1098
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:42,353
all they will call you will be deportees

1099
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:47,195
Oklahoma and Texas ain't nothin'
compared to California.

1100
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:50,949
That don't seem right somehow,
it bein' so pretty out here.

1101
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:52,513
No.

1102
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:54,596
It ain't right.

1103
01:52:54,720 --> 01:52:56,676
It ain't right at all.

1104
01:52:58,240 --> 01:53:03,553
It does seem like it was easier to put up
with nature and dust storms an' all

1105
01:53:03,680 --> 01:53:06,513
than it is to put up with greed.

1106
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:10,196
Yeah, I guess so.

1107
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:16,316
Did you... did you ever make
that list for Mr. Locke?

1108
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:21,078
No, I didn't. Not yet.

1109
01:53:22,600 --> 01:53:26,354
- Don't he want it right away?
- I suppose he does.

1110
01:53:29,160 --> 01:53:34,029
It just ain't that easy for me to do.
Make up a list!

1111
01:53:34,560 --> 01:53:36,516
No, I guess not.

1112
01:53:39,920 --> 01:53:42,673
I was cleanin' yesterday, Woody.

1113
01:53:42,800 --> 01:53:49,069
This old man - he must have been
70 years old - he didn't have no teeth,

1114
01:53:49,200 --> 01:53:52,033
and he wasn't wearin' no shoes.

1115
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:55,789
He came to the door, beggin' for food.

1116
01:53:55,920 --> 01:53:58,673
I gave him some fried chicken.

1117
01:53:59,600 --> 01:54:04,355
His wrinkled...
wrinkled old face just lit right up.

1118
01:54:06,400 --> 01:54:08,630
Then I started in worryin' about us.

1119
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:12,594
I got real worried, Woody, askin' myself:

1120
01:54:12,720 --> 01:54:16,269
"My god, are we gonna be like that
again two weeks from now?"

1121
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:19,870
I can't help thinkin' about those bad times.

1122
01:54:20,000 --> 01:54:22,639
I don't want 'em to happen again.

1123
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:59,951
Woody? It's me. Johnson.

1124
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:02,036
Hey! It sure is!

1125
01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:05,196
What the hell happened to you?

1126
01:55:05,320 --> 01:55:08,357
Oh, we had some trouble out there.

1127
01:55:08,480 --> 01:55:14,032
Them owners, they sent their men
chargin' into a picket line we had set up.

1128
01:55:14,160 --> 01:55:20,395
And they're swingin' their clubs
in every direction just... they just got me.

1129
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:24,671
- They did that to you?
- Yeah.

1130
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,031
- Wow.
- There were some others, I知 afraid.

1131
01:55:29,040 --> 01:55:31,156
What about your family? They ok?

1132
01:55:31,280 --> 01:55:33,316
Yeah. Yeah, they're fine.

1133
01:55:33,440 --> 01:55:38,275
Fact is, I been learnin'
an awful lot from that baby of mine.

1134
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,997
- You been learnin', have you?
- Yeah.

1135
01:55:43,120 --> 01:55:45,429
Yeah, I been learnin'.

1136
01:55:45,560 --> 01:55:49,235
When that baby wants somethin',
she's gonna cry

1137
01:55:49,360 --> 01:55:53,353
and carry on somethin' awful
till she gets what she's after.

1138
01:55:55,080 --> 01:56:00,359
Then I started thinkin' about
all those thousands of people,

1139
01:56:00,480 --> 01:56:05,679
workin' out there in the fields,
never gettin' nothin' they want.

1140
01:56:06,560 --> 01:56:10,838
Just givin' up, never sayin' nothin'.

1141
01:56:13,960 --> 01:56:16,997
I don't wind up like that, Woody.

1142
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:21,196
I don't wanna end up just sittin' around.

1143
01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:30,715
So I made up my mind that I知 just gonna
speak out, just like that baby of mine.

1144
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:35,235
I知 gonna let folks know what I want.

1145
01:56:39,360 --> 01:56:41,590
What's Liz think about all this?

1146
01:56:42,200 --> 01:56:45,670
She's plenty scared.
You know how women are.

1147
01:56:46,200 --> 01:56:48,236
She says she's proud of me.

1148
01:56:48,360 --> 01:56:50,191
I bet she is.

1149
01:56:50,840 --> 01:56:53,035
Yeah.

1150
01:56:53,160 --> 01:56:56,311
Anyway, Woody, what I come to tell you...

1151
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:02,632
is keep up your music,
cos everybody's listenin'.

1152
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:09,317
Well, Luther...
keep on doin' the work, huh?

1153
01:57:19,080 --> 01:57:22,834
Woody. I want the list,
and I want it right now.

1154
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,637
That wasn't so...
just a minute, please.

1155
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,320
That wasn't so painful, was it?

1156
01:57:37,200 --> 01:57:39,919
"Bury me beneath the willow",

1157
01:57:40,040 --> 01:57:44,192
"sweet pearl"...
"long green valley"? What is that?

1158
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:49,599
That's not about the San Fernando valley,
or pickers, orchards or anything like that?

1159
01:57:49,720 --> 01:57:53,269
It's about a man that kills his sweetheart
cos she's sleepin' around.

1160
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:55,994
- Oh, good.
- At least, he thinks she was.

1161
01:57:56,120 --> 01:57:57,951
Well, that's good.

1162
01:57:58,080 --> 01:58:01,834
Yeah, these are fine, Woody.
Fine. Thank you.

1163
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:03,270
<i>It's a mighty hard row
that these poor hands have hoed</i>

1164
01:59:06,440 --> 01:59:11,116
<i>my poor feet have travelled
a hot, dusty road</i>

1165
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:18,639
<i>from out of the old dust bowl
and westward we rolled</i>

1166
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:21,069
<i>and your deserts were hot</i>

1167
01:59:21,200 --> 01:59:25,193
and your mountains were cold

1168
01:59:28,520 --> 01:59:31,080
green pastures of plenty

1169
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,270
from high desert ground

1170
01:59:35,600 --> 01:59:41,789
from the grand coulee dam,
where the water runs down

1171
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:48,478
this land I値l defend
with my life if need be

1172
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:53,036
cos these pastures of plenty
must always

1173
01:59:56,560 --> 01:59:59,028
be free

1174
02:00:13,360 --> 02:00:15,316
look on them deserts

1175
02:00:16,960 --> 02:00:18,916
all around me

1176
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:26,116
you and me

1177
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:29,836
this land...

1178
02:00:39,480 --> 02:00:42,916
there's a better world a-comin'
tell you why

1179
02:00:43,160 --> 02:00:46,516
there's a better world a-comin'
tell you why

1180
02:00:46,640 --> 02:00:49,598
there's a better world a-comin'
by and by

1181
02:00:50,560 --> 02:00:54,314
there's a better world a-comin'
can't you see? Can't you see?

1182
02:00:54,440 --> 02:00:56,954
There's a better world a-comin'
can't you see?

1183
02:00:57,960 --> 02:01:01,555
When we'll all be union
and we'll all be free

1184
02:01:01,680 --> 02:01:04,877
there's a better world a-comin'
can't you see?

1185
02:01:05,000 --> 02:01:08,709
I知 a union man in a union war

1186
02:01:08,840 --> 02:01:12,037
it's a union world I知 fightin' for

1187
02:01:12,840 --> 02:01:16,719
now, there's a better world a-comin'
tell you why, tell you why

1188
02:01:16,840 --> 02:01:19,593
there's a better world a-comin'
tell you why

1189
02:01:20,600 --> 02:01:24,036
through the marchin' and the battlin'
you can see the chains a-rattlin'

1190
02:01:24,160 --> 02:01:26,196
- what are you doin'?
- Get outta here.

1191
02:01:26,320 --> 02:01:29,392
I値l get out when I知 good and ready,
and I ain't ready yet.

1192
02:01:29,520 --> 02:01:31,556
Yes, you are!

1193
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:37,031
Joe, hold him!

1194
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:19,072
I just been on the bum
for the last few months.

1195
02:02:19,200 --> 02:02:21,191
Figure now I値l go to la and stay there.

1196
02:02:21,320 --> 02:02:23,151
Where are you from?

1197
02:02:23,280 --> 02:02:28,434
Shit, I think I was born in an orange grove
somewhere's. I don't know.

1198
02:02:29,400 --> 02:02:31,152
Do your folks know where you are?

1199
02:02:31,280 --> 02:02:35,751
Unless they counted heads,
they wouldn't even know I was missin'.

1200
02:02:51,000 --> 02:02:52,353
Daddy!

1201
02:02:52,480 --> 02:02:54,436
- Hey, Sue.
- Hi, dad.

1202
02:02:57,320 --> 02:02:59,595
Hey! Give me a kiss.

1203
02:02:59,720 --> 02:03:01,676
Daddy!

1204
02:03:02,800 --> 02:03:04,472
What you doin' here anyway?

1205
02:03:04,600 --> 02:03:09,549
And the boy scolded us,
and their mothers and fathers...

1206
02:03:11,920 --> 02:03:13,876
- we'll eat 'em for dinner.
- Sure.

1207
02:03:15,480 --> 02:03:17,436
Guess who's home!

1208
02:03:20,160 --> 02:03:22,116
Hi, honey.

1209
02:03:23,920 --> 02:03:26,957
- Where've you been?
- Oh, I just had to...

1210
02:03:28,680 --> 02:03:31,797
touch the people for a little bit, honey.

1211
02:03:33,680 --> 02:03:35,636
Well, darn it, Woody.

1212
02:03:36,840 --> 02:03:42,472
While you been out fightin' again,
you may have just lost that job.

1213
02:03:42,600 --> 02:03:45,398
Mr. Locke痴 been callin' every day,
and he's upset.

1214
02:03:45,520 --> 02:03:48,637
And that agent fella's been callin',
and he's mad.

1215
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:53,880
- To hell with them.
- You can't say that. You can't say that!

1216
02:03:54,000 --> 02:03:59,438
Mr. Locke is paying you better than ever
before. You can't say to hell with all that.

1217
02:03:59,560 --> 02:04:01,596
That don't mean nothin'.

1218
02:04:03,680 --> 02:04:06,035
Well, if it don't, what does?

1219
02:04:07,480 --> 02:04:09,789
I know it ain't me and the kids.

1220
02:04:09,920 --> 02:04:13,913
You don't think nothin' about runnin' off
whenever you get the urge.

1221
02:04:14,040 --> 02:04:18,556
Oh, Mary... don't even talk like that.

1222
02:04:20,200 --> 02:04:24,591
Now, I truly care about you
and the kids. I truly care.

1223
02:04:24,720 --> 02:04:26,676
That sure ain't the way it seems.

1224
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:30,156
You're spendin' your whole life
tryin' to fix the world.

1225
02:04:30,280 --> 02:04:34,239
- You don't do nothin' to help our family.
- Hell!

1226
02:04:34,360 --> 02:04:36,430
I brought you out here to California!

1227
02:04:36,560 --> 02:04:38,630
And then you left!

1228
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:45,154
Hell, Mary, it's just that i... can't seem to...
just can't stand to sit still.

1229
02:04:45,280 --> 02:04:50,070
I always feel like I ought to be
somewhere's else. Anywhere's else!

1230
02:04:50,200 --> 02:04:54,273
Well, what about me?
What am I supposed to do?

1231
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:59,474
Sit, and wait, while you are off
gallivantin' around the country?!

1232
02:04:59,600 --> 02:05:01,079
Am i?!

1233
02:05:01,200 --> 02:05:06,194
Am I supposed to just sit, and worry
if the kids are gonna have a daddy,

1234
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:09,676
cos maybe you got your head bashed in?

1235
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:11,552
Am i? Am i?!

1236
02:05:11,680 --> 02:05:16,800
Supposed to sit home and pray you ain't
wanderin' around, bleedin' to death?

1237
02:05:16,920 --> 02:05:21,471
You keep goin' like this and our family's
gonna be beggin' them growers for work.

1238
02:05:21,600 --> 02:05:23,477
- Dammit...
- we'll be beggin'!

1239
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:26,672
- Stop your talkin'.
- It won't make anything better!

1240
02:05:26,800 --> 02:05:29,678
- I said, stop talkin'!
- I ain't through!

1241
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:32,519
Just one more word, now,
just one more word...

1242
02:05:32,640 --> 02:05:37,236
are you sure you haven't got somethin'
else on your mind? You positive?!

1243
02:05:37,360 --> 02:05:38,952
Oh, now...

1244
02:05:39,080 --> 02:05:41,389
ah...

1245
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:43,636
- Mary...
- no.

1246
02:06:08,080 --> 02:06:13,552
So help me, if anyone else had walked out
on me, they'd be out on the street.

1247
02:06:13,680 --> 02:06:18,800
I知 gonna give you one more chance.
Just one. But I want you to be responsible.

1248
02:06:18,920 --> 02:06:23,755
No, I won't take off my buckskin gloves
they're made of Spanish leather

1249
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:26,189
I値l go my way
from day to day

1250
02:06:26,320 --> 02:06:30,996
and sing with the Gypsy Davy
and sing it with the Gypsy Davy

1251
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:33,475
that song with the Gypsy Davy

1252
02:06:33,600 --> 02:06:37,912
and lovin'

1253
02:06:38,040 --> 02:06:43,068
that Gypsy Davy

1254
02:06:46,680 --> 02:06:50,958
I壇 like to dedicate this next song
to all you pickers out there,

1255
02:06:51,080 --> 02:06:54,470
with your hearts achin'
and bellies growlin'.

1256
02:06:54,600 --> 02:06:58,388
And I壇 like you to remember that
if you feel like singin' along with me,

1257
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,476
and you don't know all the words,

1258
02:07:00,600 --> 02:07:03,956
just go ahead and make up
some of your own.

1259
02:07:04,080 --> 02:07:07,470
I知 sure you all got plenty to say
about the way things are.

1260
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:10,717
You continually force me
to treat you like a child.

1261
02:07:10,840 --> 02:07:12,796
What do I say to get through to you?

1262
02:07:12,920 --> 02:07:16,549
You could tell me
you don't like my singin'.

1263
02:07:16,680 --> 02:07:19,513
That is not up to me, Woody.
There are sponsors.

1264
02:07:19,640 --> 02:07:22,996
- Now, if it were up to me...
- then you do like my singin'?

1265
02:07:23,120 --> 02:07:27,033
That isn't the point! I知 trying to tell you
something. There are sponsors.

1266
02:07:27,160 --> 02:07:29,833
They pay for the right to hear
what they wanna hear.

1267
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:32,713
Maybe you like
some of my singin' but not all?

1268
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:35,559
Woody, please! Just listen to me.

1269
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,240
They feel that that kind of material...

1270
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:41,955
I like my singin' too much
to take orders from some fat little squirt

1271
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,231
doesn't even know his own mind!

1272
02:07:45,360 --> 02:07:48,557
Well, then there's not much
to discuss, is there?

1273
02:07:48,680 --> 02:07:51,638
You want the job,
or do you not want the job?

1274
02:07:51,760 --> 02:07:55,230
Do you think I can't replace you?
In ten minutes? In five?

1275
02:07:55,360 --> 02:07:57,954
I don't need this place.
I can sing on the street.

1276
02:07:58,080 --> 02:08:00,594
Well, get the hell outta my office!

1277
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:04,474
I don't need you.
I can sing while I知 walkin'.

1278
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,195
Woody!

1279
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:18,552
- What the hell are you up to?
- I ain't in no mood for talkin'.

1280
02:08:18,680 --> 02:08:21,956
- You got your butt fired, didn't you?
- Damn right, I did.

1281
02:08:22,080 --> 02:08:24,275
- What did he tell you?
- Nothin'.

1282
02:08:24,400 --> 02:08:26,755
- He didn't say anything about baker?
- Who?

1283
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:29,110
- That agent.
- Hell, no.

1284
02:08:30,080 --> 02:08:34,153
No, he wouldn't. You see, baker's
been callin' you about 20 times a day.

1285
02:08:34,280 --> 02:08:37,955
He is startin' to get things
rollin' for you, Woody.

1286
02:08:38,080 --> 02:08:40,310
Rollin' how? What do you mean?

1287
02:08:40,440 --> 02:08:45,434
He's got you all signed up
to do a spot for CBS, coast to coast!

1288
02:08:45,560 --> 02:08:48,199
- Coast to coast?
- That's right.

1289
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:51,549
- Damn! Coast to coast.
- And that ain't all.

1290
02:08:51,680 --> 02:08:54,592
He's got an audition lined up,
some big hotel downtown.

1291
02:08:54,720 --> 02:08:57,553
A show like that could bring you in
another 100 a week.

1292
02:08:57,680 --> 02:08:59,636
Damn!

1293
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:04,956
Shoot, Woody, you're gonna wind up
singin' to this whole damn country.

1294
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:07,514
We got us some celebratin' to do.

1295
02:09:07,640 --> 02:09:10,393
Damn! Coast to coast?!

1296
02:09:11,360 --> 02:09:13,316
Whoo-hoo!

1297
02:09:39,760 --> 02:09:42,149
Come on, Woody.

1298
02:09:43,200 --> 02:09:45,077
Jesus!

1299
02:09:45,200 --> 02:09:47,236
Here comes Santa Claus!

1300
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,234
Where is everybody?

1301
02:10:12,760 --> 02:10:16,309
Whoo-hoo! It's everybody's birthday!

1302
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:19,796
And there ain't nobody gettin' any older!

1303
02:10:38,480 --> 02:10:40,550
Mary's gone.

1304
02:10:50,320 --> 02:10:52,276
She took the kids.

1305
02:10:57,160 --> 02:10:59,515
Gone back to pampa.

1306
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:06,476
Oh, hell!

1307
02:11:15,240 --> 02:11:18,550
You don't think she left cos you got fired?

1308
02:11:18,680 --> 02:11:20,636
She left before that.

1309
02:11:22,920 --> 02:11:26,629
She always leaves the time on a note.

1310
02:11:30,360 --> 02:11:32,828
4:30.

1311
02:11:32,960 --> 02:11:36,669
4:30, yesterday afternoon.

1312
02:11:40,360 --> 02:11:42,316
Damn woman, anyhow.

1313
02:11:46,760 --> 02:11:50,389
Who the hell cares
what time you write a note?

1314
02:11:51,480 --> 02:11:53,436
Huh?

1315
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:57,953
I知 in the mood for love

1316
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:04,519
simply because you're near me

1317
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:10,996
funny, but when you're near me

1318
02:12:11,760 --> 02:12:17,392
I知 in the mood for love

1319
02:12:18,440 --> 02:12:19,634
heaven was...

1320
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:22,228
there's steady money here at the grove.

1321
02:12:22,360 --> 02:12:24,999
I知 gonna book you here for six weeks.

1322
02:12:25,120 --> 02:12:30,194
Then I知 gonna book you in every
top hotel and club in the country.

1323
02:12:31,240 --> 02:12:34,198
You gotta watch your step,
though, at CBS.

1324
02:12:34,320 --> 02:12:37,551
You gotta be careful
about the material you select.

1325
02:12:39,320 --> 02:12:41,550
Thank you. Thank you.

1326
02:12:41,680 --> 02:12:44,319
We already have a ballad singer.

1327
02:12:46,120 --> 02:12:48,998
- I think we should see him.
- Who? Guthrie?

1328
02:12:49,120 --> 02:12:52,795
I heard good reports about Guthrie.
Mr. Guthrie.

1329
02:13:26,240 --> 02:13:31,678
It's a mighty hard row
that these poor hands have hoed

1330
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:39,200
my poor feet have travelled
a hot, dusty road

1331
02:13:43,120 --> 02:13:48,194
on the edge of your city
you'll see us there and then

1332
02:13:48,320 --> 02:13:51,756
I come with the dust
and I知 gone...

1333
02:13:53,560 --> 02:13:55,869
Mr. Guthrie. That's enough.

1334
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,831
...with the wind

1335
02:13:57,960 --> 02:13:59,916
that's enough, Mr. Guthrie.

1336
02:14:00,040 --> 02:14:01,996
Thank you!

1337
02:14:04,160 --> 02:14:07,596
- You have a really nice quality
- he's wonderful.

1338
02:14:07,720 --> 02:14:12,430
- I told you I heard good reports.
- What kind of angle could we use?

1339
02:14:12,560 --> 02:14:14,118
Western?

1340
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:18,028
What about
a simple hillbilly presentation?

1341
02:14:18,160 --> 02:14:21,470
Big overalls, maybe a straw hat.

1342
02:14:22,240 --> 02:14:24,470
Stick him in front of a haystack.

1343
02:14:24,600 --> 02:14:28,388
That might work. We could get
the Benton brothers to back him up.

1344
02:14:28,520 --> 02:14:30,238
I think so.

1345
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:32,635
Let's use him as a lead into...

1346
02:14:32,760 --> 02:14:34,955
excuse me.

1347
02:14:35,080 --> 02:14:39,949
While you folks are talkin' to each other,
which way is the bathroom?

1348
02:14:40,080 --> 02:14:43,277
Oh. Out the door, turn right,
first door on the right.

1349
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:04,110
Woody!

1350
02:15:04,240 --> 02:15:07,710
This is a big chance for you.
Can you afford to throw it away?

1351
02:15:07,840 --> 02:15:11,071
- Where are you goin'?!
- Out of this damn hotel.

1352
02:15:11,200 --> 02:15:15,193
I got no desire to sing to folks
that's drinkin' martinis

1353
02:15:15,320 --> 02:15:18,278
and stuffin' themselves full of lamb chops.

1354
02:15:18,400 --> 02:15:21,233
But the CBS broadcast?
You gonna throw that away too?

1355
02:15:21,360 --> 02:15:26,912
Standin' in a radio station, doin' what they
tell me to do, ain't my idea of havin' fun.

1356
02:15:27,040 --> 02:15:30,555
Woody, stop a minute and let's talk it out.
This is important.

1357
02:15:30,680 --> 02:15:33,990
It ain't nothin', Ozark.
I値l tell you what's important.

1358
02:15:34,120 --> 02:15:39,148
The worst thing that can happen
is to cut yourself loose from the folks.

1359
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:43,030
Where the hell are you goin'?!

1360
02:15:43,160 --> 02:15:45,958
- Just tell me where you're goin'!
- Hell, I don't know.

1361
02:15:46,080 --> 02:15:49,277
Europe, New York, China...

1362
02:15:50,400 --> 02:15:52,038
New York.

1363
02:15:52,160 --> 02:15:55,596
- Maybe I値l come. When are you leavin'?
- Now!

1364
02:15:55,720 --> 02:15:59,759
Why do you have to go at everything
like you're killin' snakes with a hoe?

1365
02:15:59,880 --> 02:16:02,235
- And why New York?
- Why the hell not?

1366
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:05,750
It's got people, don't it? It's got unions.

1367
02:16:05,880 --> 02:16:08,917
Besides, I can sing while I知 walkin' there.

1368
02:16:09,520 --> 02:16:12,273
<i>This land is your land</i>

1369
02:16:12,400 --> 02:16:14,277
<i>this land is my land</i>

1370
02:16:14,400 --> 02:16:21,476
- so long, Woody!
- From California to the New York island

1371
02:16:21,600 --> 02:16:26,958
<i>from the Redwood forest
to the Gulf stream waters</i>

1372
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:30,789
<i>I hate a song that
makes you think you're not any good.</i>

1373
02:16:30,920 --> 02:16:35,675
<i>I hate a song that makes you think
you're just born to lose. Bound to lose.</i>

1374
02:16:35,800 --> 02:16:39,031
<i>No good to nobody.
No good for nothin'.</i>

1375
02:16:39,160 --> 02:16:43,073
<i>Because you're either too old
or too young or too fat or too thin</i>

1376
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:45,589
<i>or too ugly or too this or too that.</i>

1377
02:16:45,720 --> 02:16:48,632
<i>Songs that run you down
or songs that poke fun at you,</i>

1378

1379
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:54,308
<i>I am out to fight those kind of songs</i>

1380

<i>to my very last breath of air

1386
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:24,276

<i>This land was made for you and me</i>

1397
02:18:24,400 --> 02:18:28,518
<i>When the sun came shining
and I was strolling</i>

1398
02:18:28,640 --> 02:18:32,758
<i>and the wheat fields waving
and the dust clouds rolling</i>

1399
02:18:32,880 --> 02:18:37,271
<i>as the fog was lifting
a voice was chanting:</i>

1400

<i>This land was made for you and me</i>

1401
