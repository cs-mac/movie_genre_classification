1
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:45,986
<i>I, Hamar, lord high priest of Egypt... </i>

2
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:48,954
<i>... am preparing a chronicle
of the reign of Khufu... </i>

3
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:51,059
<i>... ruler of Egypt. </i>

4
00:01:51,227 --> 00:01:52,489
<i>Word has come that again... </i>

5
00:01:52,662 --> 00:01:56,154
<i>... he has been victorious in
the war against our enemies. </i>

6
00:01:56,332 --> 00:02:01,827
<i>And now Egypt has taken its place as
the greatest of all nations in the world. </i>

7
00:02:02,438 --> 00:02:06,465
<i>Today, Pharaoh and his army return. </i>

8
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,423
<i>This was Pharaoh... </i>

9
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,555
<i>... direct descendant of our deity Amun... </i>

10
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:42,527
<i>... god of the sun, who rules the heavens... </i>

11
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,293
<i>... as Pharaoh rules the Earth. </i>

12
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:55,901
<i>Again, he brought treasure... </i>

13
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:00,140
<i>... gold and precious jewels
taken from our enemies. </i>

14
00:05:00,316 --> 00:05:03,046
<i>For to Pharaoh, riches were power. </i>

15
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,120
<i>And power was to be desired. </i>

16
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,816
<i>And also again, he brought many captives... </i>

17
00:05:10,994 --> 00:05:14,691
<i>... for is it not by slaves
that one becomes even richer... </i>

18
00:05:14,864 --> 00:05:17,628
<i>... and then has more power?</i>

19
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,119
Greetings, my lord priest.

20
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:55,662
Sire, the gods rejoice at your safe return.

21
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,232
Thank you, my lord priest.

22
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:08,437
Your Majesty.

23
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:10,408
My lord, it is good to have you back.

24
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,912
It is good to be back.

25
00:07:13,082 --> 00:07:16,176
I'm afraid to touch you
because of the dirt of travel.

26
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,752
Perhaps my lord would
care to remove the dirt.

27
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,889
An excellent idea.

28
00:07:21,057 --> 00:07:22,752
Then I will come to my lord.

29
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,926
When I am ready, I will send you word.

30
00:07:27,997 --> 00:07:31,160
I rejoice at your safe return, my lord.

31
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,995
Thank you.

32
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,797
- Your name is?
- Mayva, my lord.

33
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,031
oh, yes, I remember.

34
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,936
Has the bird learned to speak yet?

35
00:07:40,109 --> 00:07:43,738
oh, yes, my lord, but only in private.

36
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:47,408
Well, perhaps it's better that way.

37
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:57,459
Hamar, dear friend, it's good to
see you again. I've missed you.

38
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,219
I've missed you too, sire.

39
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:01,022
It's been three long months.

40
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:02,425
We've much to talk about.

41
00:08:02,598 --> 00:08:05,692
But first, I must bathe.

42
00:08:05,868 --> 00:08:08,928
The sand seems to get in
every pore of one's body.

43
00:08:09,105 --> 00:08:11,130
Why can't we do away with the desert, Hamar?

44
00:08:11,307 --> 00:08:14,174
I'm only a priest, not a god, sire.

45
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:17,176
outside of a discomfort, the
desert hasn't been too much...

46
00:08:17,346 --> 00:08:19,610
...of an obstacle to you
in the past or this time.

47
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:22,342
No, the Egyptian soldier
fights well in the desert.

48
00:08:22,518 --> 00:08:25,851
- I've done well, Hamar. very well.
- So I have heard.

49
00:08:26,022 --> 00:08:28,013
Four hundred men loaded with treasure.

50
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,125
Wait till you see it.

51
00:08:33,229 --> 00:08:34,457
That feels much better.

52
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:36,928
Tell the queen I've finished.

53
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,296
Well, have I changed?

54
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:41,993
Not very much.

55
00:08:42,171 --> 00:08:44,366
You're one war older, that's all.

56
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,236
I hope to age by many more
before my time is come.

57
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:49,935
More wars, more treasure.

58
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,046
Still not enough?

59
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:54,078
You know I can't resist gold.

60
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,478
Yes, I know.

61
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:58,142
The first fight we had as children, remember?

62
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:02,087
We fought for a little gold
ring that had been a gift to me.

63
00:09:02,391 --> 00:09:05,019
You won the fight and you took the ring.

64
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:09,597
And you tricked me into some wager and
got it back before nightfall, remember?

65
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:12,097
And you've been fighting for gold ever since.

66
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,835
And I mean to keep it forever.

67
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:16,437
Hamar...

68
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,407
I see that you have cleansed
yourself of the desert, my lord.

69
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,080
You are beautiful.

70
00:09:30,253 --> 00:09:32,721
Even more beautiful than my memories of you.

71
00:09:33,022 --> 00:09:34,922
Three months in the desert is a long time.

72
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:37,787
- Perhaps that's why...
- No, to any man at any time.

73
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,325
Isn't that so, Hamar?

74
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,087
Hamar...

75
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:43,322
He's gone.

76
00:09:43,766 --> 00:09:46,758
You've always said he's the
wisest man in the kingdom.

77
00:09:46,936 --> 00:09:50,497
And by his going, he proved it.

78
00:09:55,911 --> 00:09:58,106
Each morning and each night...

79
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:01,045
...I prayed to the gods for
your safe and speedy return.

80
00:10:01,217 --> 00:10:02,479
Let me look at you.

81
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,951
Am I a fool to leave you here and
roam the world seeking for treasure?

82
00:10:07,123 --> 00:10:09,318
No, my lord, if treasure's what you want.

83
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:11,551
I want treasure, yes.

84
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:13,824
But there's something else I want too.

85
00:10:13,996 --> 00:10:15,827
And that is?

86
00:10:16,065 --> 00:10:18,226
I've been thinking, Egypt is a great country.

87
00:10:18,401 --> 00:10:21,165
When I am gone, who will rule?

88
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,597
I want an heir. A son.

89
00:10:24,307 --> 00:10:25,638
I know, my lord.

90
00:10:25,808 --> 00:10:29,471
You have fought five wars in
the six years of our marriage.

91
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:33,706
This has not been your home, only
a place to leave to another war.

92
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:36,051
I know that.

93
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:40,953
Supposing I say I'll stay
at home and not go to war?

94
00:10:41,991 --> 00:10:44,391
I will not ask that of you.

95
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,290
only stay with me for a little while...

96
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:51,923
...and if the gods will
it, I will give you a son.

97
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,145
- I'm looking for a prisoner called vashtar.
- I'm he.

98
00:11:08,317 --> 00:11:10,842
I've brought you food and
wine and various supplies.

99
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,988
You can put it in the tent over there.

100
00:11:13,155 --> 00:11:14,952
- You mean you brought this for me?
- Yes.

101
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,285
- What about the others?
- Food and wine is yours.

102
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,860
- Do with it as you please.
- Thank you. We'll use it.

103
00:11:20,029 --> 00:11:23,055
Mikka, take charge of the food.
Give it to those who need it most.

104
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:26,895
- Yes, sir. I'll take charge of the wine too.
- Mikka, the wine's for the sick.

105
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,435
- Yes, sir. I'll see to it.
- Senta, go with Mikka.

106
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,005
Senta, don't you understand?
They've brought us food.

107
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:33,573
Egyptian food?

108
00:11:33,743 --> 00:11:35,404
Senta!

109
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,246
You have to excuse my son, captain.
He's too young to accept captivity.

110
00:11:39,415 --> 00:11:42,350
It doesn't matter. I bring
another message for you.

111
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:46,079
This afternoon, we bury some of our
people who were killed in battle.

112
00:11:46,255 --> 00:11:48,189
Perhaps you'd like to attend the ceremony.

113
00:11:48,357 --> 00:11:49,881
- You're free to do so.
- Free?

114
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:53,495
- Aren't you afraid I might try to escape?
- And leave your people?

115
00:11:53,662 --> 00:11:56,358
- No, I don't think you'll escape.
- Perhaps you're right.

116
00:11:56,532 --> 00:11:58,329
Yes, I should like to see the ceremony.

117
00:11:58,501 --> 00:12:01,937
- I'll come for you when it is time.
- Thank you, captain.

118
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,643
People of Egypt...

119
00:12:16,218 --> 00:12:20,917
...we meet here today to pay
homage to our heroic dead.

120
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:26,358
Let their stilled hearts hear
no sound of lamentation...

121
00:12:26,529 --> 00:12:28,997
...only of rejoicing...

122
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,759
...that their destiny has been fulfilled.

123
00:12:32,935 --> 00:12:35,165
Their earthly lives they have given...

124
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:40,331
...so that they and you may enjoy
both the present and the second life.

125
00:12:41,444 --> 00:12:45,403
Let them hear now the manner
in which they will live.

126
00:12:45,748 --> 00:12:48,512
Let the gods of Egypt speak.

127
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:51,016
In the name of the gods, listen.

128
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:57,117
<i>Hear the voice of Osiris,
the judge of the dead. </i>

129
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:02,197
<i>The goddess, Isis, commands you to listen. </i>

130
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,698
<i>Give heed to the god Anubia... </i>

131
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,238
<i>... the conductor of the dead
from this life to the next. </i>

132
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:17,211
<i>Give heed in the name of the god Horus. </i>

133
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,583
Let Pharaoh now, the
living god of Egypt, speak.

134
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:25,811
And in the name of the gods, listen.

135
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:36,828
This is my decree.

136
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:41,064
The bodies of those who died
well and bravely by my side...

137
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,797
...shall be delivered
to the City of the Dead.

138
00:13:44,106 --> 00:13:47,507
Fine linen and armor shall
be their burial garments.

139
00:13:47,676 --> 00:13:49,541
They shall rest in tombs of stone.

140
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:55,849
And for their comfort in the second
life, they shall have ample treasure.

141
00:13:56,018 --> 00:14:01,183
To each man, three measures of
gold and nine measures of silver.

142
00:14:01,357 --> 00:14:04,224
one vessel each of onyx and alabaster.

143
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,884
Food and wine in plenty.

144
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:12,967
All this and all honor shall
each man enjoy in the second life.

145
00:14:13,135 --> 00:14:15,103
There we shall meet again...

146
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:18,763
...to stand side by side and serve.

147
00:14:19,642 --> 00:14:22,577
Till then, farewell.

148
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:27,810
The gods of Egypt have spoken.

149
00:15:31,814 --> 00:15:33,111
Listen to them, vashtar.

150
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,682
This is a funeral but they're not sad.

151
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,580
They almost seem as if they're happy.

152
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:39,152
I believe they are happy.

153
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:43,018
The life they hope for in the future
seems to mean more than their present life.

154
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:47,356
I wonder if any of them ever saw or
spoke to somebody living in the future.

155
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,554
I don't think so, Mikka.

156
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:52,257
I'd rather enjoy this life.

157
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:56,768
Mind you, the wine in the
grave sounds a good idea.

158
00:15:57,406 --> 00:15:59,840
But how do I know I'd be thirsty?

159
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:23,591
officer, what is this? Another ceremony?

160
00:16:23,766 --> 00:16:25,563
Yes, if you could call it that.

161
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,134
The singing is different.

162
00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,328
This time they're not happy.

163
00:16:30,506 --> 00:16:32,667
This is for those who were cowards in battle.

164
00:16:32,841 --> 00:16:35,105
Those who deserted or failed in their duty.

165
00:16:35,277 --> 00:16:38,246
They will not be buried and will
therefore have no second life.

166
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:40,905
That is why their people mourn.

167
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:45,044
Strange religion to deny the future
to one who fails in the present.

168
00:16:55,197 --> 00:16:56,687
Look, vashtar.

169
00:16:56,865 --> 00:16:58,730
Look what they're doing.

170
00:17:19,354 --> 00:17:20,787
Hamar, look.

171
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,983
This is the portion of the spoils
that I've chosen to be mine.

172
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,355
Look at this. Feel it.

173
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,224
I love the feel of gold.

174
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,662
There's no other metal like it.

175
00:17:31,834 --> 00:17:36,396
Add this to what I have already, and it'll
be the greatest treasure in the world.

176
00:17:36,572 --> 00:17:38,472
No man will ever have had so much.

177
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,232
That is true, sire.

178
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:45,470
Now all that remains is to build
a tomb to receive it and my body.

179
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:49,139
A tomb that no man can violate,
where I can rest in peace...

180
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,582
...and enjoy all this in my second life.

181
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,688
- You've got my instructions?
- I did, sire.

182
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:56,791
Builders have been at work day
and night since the message came.

183
00:17:56,959 --> 00:17:59,052
Their plans are ready for you to see.

184
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:01,287
Do you think their work is good?

185
00:18:01,463 --> 00:18:05,627
It is your treasure, sire, and
your tomb. You must be the judge.

186
00:18:05,868 --> 00:18:07,301
That means you don't like them?

187
00:18:07,469 --> 00:18:09,630
You must decide, sire.

188
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:19,746
And what is this?

189
00:18:19,915 --> 00:18:22,975
A labyrinth to hide the passage to the tomb?

190
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:24,585
Here is the beginning, my lord.

191
00:18:24,753 --> 00:18:27,221
And here is the maze that hides the secret.

192
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:29,323
It will make the tomb secure so...

193
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:32,016
Secure as the last tomb in
which a labyrinth was used?

194
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,891
My ancestor Serati was
protected by such a labyrinth.

195
00:18:36,064 --> 00:18:38,862
Perhaps you heard what
happened to him. And this?

196
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,331
This is different, my lord.

197
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:42,436
- It begins here...
- Different in what way?

198
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:46,233
I just brought treasure back to Egypt
that was stolen from a tomb like this...

199
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,036
...three nights after the crypt was sealed.

200
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:52,271
And look what we have here. Hamar,
it's like meeting an old friend.

201
00:18:52,447 --> 00:18:55,439
A false tunnel and a false
crypt to hide the real one.

202
00:18:55,617 --> 00:18:57,676
It would scarcely keep out the wind.

203
00:18:57,853 --> 00:18:59,684
Are they all like these?

204
00:18:59,855 --> 00:19:03,154
What reason is there to build
a pyramid to hold a tomb...

205
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:05,953
...if the tomb may be violated?

206
00:19:06,128 --> 00:19:08,619
It is better to lay the
treasure on the sand...

207
00:19:08,797 --> 00:19:11,789
...so that the thieves
will not disturb my body.

208
00:19:11,967 --> 00:19:14,026
You may go, all of you.

209
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,228
Go home and consider yourselves lucky...

210
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:18,737
...that you've escaped
the lash or the dungeon.

211
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,205
Go on. Get out of here!

212
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:26,481
- I was afraid of this, Hamar.
- I'm sorry, sire.

213
00:19:26,648 --> 00:19:28,741
These plans have been
used for a royal tomb...

214
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,044
...and not one has escaped the grave robbers.

215
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,314
There are many thieves and very few Pharaohs.

216
00:19:34,489 --> 00:19:36,855
I'm waiting to hear your solution, sire.

217
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,515
Why do you presume I have one?

218
00:19:38,694 --> 00:19:41,288
You were curiously gentle with the builders.

219
00:19:41,463 --> 00:19:43,192
Does anyone have a secret from you?

220
00:19:43,365 --> 00:19:44,832
What is your plan, sire?

221
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,060
Do you know what happened in the
last battle for that Cushite city?

222
00:19:48,237 --> 00:19:49,465
only the outcome.

223
00:19:49,638 --> 00:19:52,698
Yes, the outcome was very
nearly disastrous for us.

224
00:19:52,875 --> 00:19:55,605
There were three passes
that led into the city.

225
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,769
Two of them were narrow,
rock-filled nightmares...

226
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,973
...where a legion could
be held by half as many.

227
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,175
The third was almost a highway.

228
00:20:04,353 --> 00:20:06,878
There seemed to be no possible defense.

229
00:20:07,055 --> 00:20:09,523
That highway was one of
the most cunning traps...

230
00:20:09,691 --> 00:20:11,955
...that has ever been constructed.

231
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,788
When we were well into it...

232
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:17,830
...parts of the road
dropped, creating pitfalls.

233
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,800
other parts suddenly rose as if by magic...

234
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,037
...giving shelter to the defenders.

235
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:27,937
Luckily, I had sent small
divisions through the other passes.

236
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,240
They fought their way through and
fell upon the defenders from behind.

237
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,942
The man who constructed those defenses...

238
00:20:36,118 --> 00:20:39,417
...was the finest builder who
has ever worked with stone.

239
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:40,883
When the city was taken...

240
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:44,617
...I gave a gold sword to the
soldier who brought him to me alive.

241
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:49,096
- Is his name vashtar?
- What?

242
00:20:49,264 --> 00:20:52,631
When I heard of a special treatment,
the tent and the food you ordered...

243
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:56,100
...for one of the captives,
I made some inquiries.

244
00:20:56,271 --> 00:20:57,795
I had him brought here.

245
00:20:57,973 --> 00:20:59,304
He's waiting outside.

246
00:20:59,474 --> 00:21:01,271
Bring him here.

247
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,808
Is the captive vashtar here yet?

248
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:10,850
- Yes, my lord.
- Bring him in.

249
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:15,522
I should have known better than try
to keep a secret from you, my friend.

250
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,690
You are vashtar?

251
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,268
The man who prepared the
defenses of your city?

252
00:21:29,438 --> 00:21:31,429
I am the architect who drew the plans.

253
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:34,700
You cost me many lives. I
congratulate you on your work.

254
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:37,003
Each of us must fight with weapons as he has.

255
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:38,976
Yes, I know that because I'm a soldier.

256
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:42,742
I do not intend to punish you,
architect, but to reward your skill.

257
00:21:42,918 --> 00:21:44,351
You shall build for me.

258
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,646
Do you understand what these are?

259
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:54,628
Yes, Pharaoh. They're designs
for a royal tomb within a pyramid.

260
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:57,390
But I do not understand what you want of me.

261
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,091
All the world knows that in
the building of pyramids...

262
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:02,395
...Egypt is unsurpassed.
- True enough.

263
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:06,667
But where we have failed is making
the tomb secure against violation.

264
00:22:06,842 --> 00:22:09,242
Can it be done? Can you do it?

265
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,438
Perhaps. But I have a better plan.
Load your treasure onto boats.

266
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:16,550
Float them to the deepest part
of the ocean and sink them there.

267
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:19,915
Then you need not fear that anyone
will rob you of what you've stolen.

268
00:22:21,156 --> 00:22:23,750
Men don't talk to me like that.

269
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,792
I could make you wish those
words had not been spoken.

270
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:30,056
But unfortunately, you
have need of my talent.

271
00:22:31,466 --> 00:22:35,061
As I thought, you're a
shrewd man. What's your price?

272
00:22:35,237 --> 00:22:36,727
- My price?
- What do you want?

273
00:22:36,905 --> 00:22:38,133
Nothing you would give me.

274
00:22:38,306 --> 00:22:41,434
Even what little I know of Egyptian
customs tells me if I build it...

275
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,737
...I sign my own death
warrant. Is that not so?

276
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:47,143
While you build my tomb, you
can build your own as well.

277
00:22:47,315 --> 00:22:51,183
Let it be done as richly as you please.
Every honor shall be given to you and yours.

278
00:22:51,353 --> 00:22:53,048
Fair prospect and a good offer.

279
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,917
Provided one believes in
the second life. I do not.

280
00:22:56,091 --> 00:22:57,752
Look elsewhere for your architect.

281
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,156
- I told you before...
- one moment, sire.

282
00:23:00,328 --> 00:23:04,128
With your permission, perhaps I can
convince this man to do as you ask.

283
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,961
I fear not. There is no
reason why I should serve you.

284
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,160
There are many reasons.

285
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:10,929
I'll show you.

286
00:23:11,106 --> 00:23:12,698
Follow me.

287
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,845
- Do you know what lies behind that wall?
- I do.

288
00:23:23,018 --> 00:23:24,986
Your people are not far from there.

289
00:23:25,253 --> 00:23:27,778
And only your talent stands
between them and the wall.

290
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,125
You were right when you
said there were many reasons.

291
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,094
If I serve you, will you spare my people?

292
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:35,991
- All of them.
- Will you set them free?

293
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:40,157
If your plan pleases me, they shall be freed
as soon as the work is done. All of them.

294
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,235
Except for yourself.

295
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,004
When I have conceived a
plan, I will send you word.

296
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,233
Good. Hamar, see that he has all he needs.

297
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,401
Work swiftly, architect.

298
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:52,945
That I may die the sooner?

299
00:23:53,415 --> 00:23:56,543
No, that your people may live.

300
00:24:16,638 --> 00:24:19,163
Well, architect, you
sent word you had a plan.

301
00:24:19,341 --> 00:24:20,569
I believe I have.

302
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:23,074
one minute. Both of you, go.

303
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,473
Well, what is it?

304
00:24:24,646 --> 00:24:27,342
It's to use the best labyrinth
designed by your builders.

305
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:30,144
- A labyrinth?
- You know these labyrinths were rejected.

306
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,445
- That was...
- I know that, but hear me out.

307
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,420
After your body is placed in the tomb...

308
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,024
...the labyrinth will be
sealed. Every passage...

309
00:24:38,193 --> 00:24:40,525
...every foot of the way
from the burial chamber...

310
00:24:40,695 --> 00:24:43,289
...to the door of the pyramid,
sealed with solid stones.

311
00:24:43,465 --> 00:24:46,127
Solid stones? But that would
take years and in that time...

312
00:24:46,301 --> 00:24:47,529
No, Pharaoh, not years.

313
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:49,966
- It can be done in a few minutes.
- You are a fool.

314
00:24:50,138 --> 00:24:52,129
What power could move stones in that time?

315
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:55,140
A power that Egypt possesses in abundance.

316
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:58,279
I will show you. Follow me.

317
00:25:04,352 --> 00:25:05,546
What is this?

318
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,315
It is with stones such as this, and
others, that the passages will be sealed.

319
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:11,686
- I asked you before, with what power?
- Sand.

320
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,088
- With what?
- With sand.

321
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,525
Wait, Pharaoh. If the boy
can lower that stone...

322
00:25:15,697 --> 00:25:18,666
...precisely into place using
only one hand, will you believe me?

323
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:20,767
I did believe in you once, architect.

324
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,463
If this is a joke, you and
your people will regret it.

325
00:25:26,174 --> 00:25:28,506
Senta, lower the stone.

326
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:43,447
It will be the same with a larger stone.

327
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,923
They'll be lowered in
every foot of the labyrinth.

328
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,322
And others on top of them.

329
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:50,521
Until the whole tomb is
surrounded by solid stone.

330
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:53,167
To enter, you'll have tear the pyramid apart.

331
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:58,839
Do you believe me now?

332
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:01,669
Tomorrow I shall give
orders to start the work.

333
00:26:01,843 --> 00:26:03,811
You have served me well, architect.

334
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,708
Take this as a token of my gratitude.

335
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,372
You promised that when the work was
completed, you would set my people free.

336
00:26:09,551 --> 00:26:12,520
- I will keep that promise.
- The work will take many years.

337
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,417
A long time for a people
to remain in slavery.

338
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:17,148
I must ask you this.

339
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:20,385
Set free a certain number every
year while the work is in progress.

340
00:26:20,562 --> 00:26:22,393
If you do this, I will serve you.

341
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,462
I will not bargain with you, architect.

342
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:28,068
But my pleasure in your
work grants your wish.

343
00:26:28,236 --> 00:26:31,103
Let it be done as he asks.
Come, we have much to do.

344
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:49,017
This day, I have sent couriers
to every part of our country...

345
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,181
...to every city and village.

346
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,589
They carry this decree.

347
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,992
<i>That I have set a task for Egypt... </i>

348
00:26:56,164 --> 00:26:59,065
<i>... which in any other
land would be impossible. </i>

349
00:26:59,234 --> 00:27:02,863
<i>On the desert sands,
you will raise a pyramid. </i>

350
00:27:03,438 --> 00:27:06,271
<i>A structure greater than
any other in the world. </i>

351
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,902
<i>This pyramid shall be my resting
place for the second life. </i>

352
00:27:13,014 --> 00:27:15,505
<i>Each man has a covenant with me. </i>

353
00:27:15,817 --> 00:27:20,277
<i>To work as man has not
yet worked in all time. </i>

354
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:22,480
And as the living god of Egypt...

355
00:27:22,657 --> 00:27:26,616
...I promise you that
each man, by his labor...

356
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:31,596
...shall secure for himself
a place in the life to come.

357
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:33,623
What say you?

358
00:27:51,553 --> 00:27:53,282
<i>As with one heart... </i>

359
00:27:53,455 --> 00:27:56,788
<i>... the people responded to
the call of their Pharaoh. </i>

360
00:27:57,325 --> 00:27:59,850
<i>They came from the farms and the groves... </i>

361
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:02,326
<i>... from the valleys and the hill countries. </i>

362
00:28:02,497 --> 00:28:06,797
<i>They gave up their accustomed lives
and marched to their holy labor. </i>

363
00:28:06,968 --> 00:28:08,560
<i>They sang... </i>

364
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:10,932
<i>... songs of their faith... </i>

365
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,240
<i>... and of their joy. </i>

366
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,769
<i>Three million of such
stones would be needed... </i>

367
00:31:36,945 --> 00:31:39,106
<i>... before the work was done. </i>

368
00:31:39,914 --> 00:31:44,647
<i>Three million stones of an
average weight of 5000 Ibs. </i>

369
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:49,654
<i>Every stone cut precisely to
fit into its destined place... </i>

370
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,314
<i>... in the great pyramid. </i>

371
00:32:01,402 --> 00:32:04,394
<i>From the quarries, they pulled
the stones across the desert... </i>

372
00:32:04,572 --> 00:32:07,040
<i>... to the banks of the Nile. </i>

373
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:12,709
<i>Never in the history of the world
has so great a task been performed. </i>

374
00:32:13,481 --> 00:32:16,382
<i>Their faith gave them strength. </i>

375
00:32:16,618 --> 00:32:18,984
<i>Their joy gave them song. </i>

376
00:33:33,895 --> 00:33:35,226
Look out!

377
00:34:08,096 --> 00:34:12,089
<i>In a little more than a year, the
hallowed ground had been prepared... </i>

378
00:34:12,266 --> 00:34:15,702
<i>... and the first courses
of stone had been raised. </i>

379
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:18,661
<i>And still they sang. </i>

380
00:34:36,791 --> 00:34:38,554
What is that stone, father?

381
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:41,058
That's the sarcophagus of the Pharaoh.

382
00:34:41,229 --> 00:34:43,663
The stone will withhold his body after death.

383
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:47,032
- Is that thing hollow then, master?
- Yes.

384
00:34:47,201 --> 00:34:50,364
The top part can be
lifted to receive the body.

385
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:52,472
Where does it go to?

386
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,599
Into a great chamber in the pyramid.
But where that is you must not know.

387
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,674
There's already the first
three courses of the stones.

388
00:35:28,843 --> 00:35:31,311
When it's finished, there'll
be more than 200 of them.

389
00:35:31,479 --> 00:35:34,812
With all those men, the work will be
finished quickly, won't it, father?

390
00:35:34,982 --> 00:35:37,951
No, Senta. No, it will take a long time.

391
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,882
They'll work for many years.

392
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,852
And some will grow old and some will die.

393
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:47,723
And the stones of the pyramid will
be cemented with blood and tears.

394
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,803
<i>And the years passed. </i>

395
00:35:57,972 --> 00:36:01,999
<i>And in those years, the joy in the
hearts of the people was stilled. </i>

396
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:05,111
<i>And in place of the song came the drum. </i>

397
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,645
<i>And with the drum, the whip. </i>

398
00:36:07,815 --> 00:36:11,342
<i>And the spirit and the faith were gone. </i>

399
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,579
<i>And the work became labor. </i>

400
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:38,202
Remember, Senta, how they sang
when they hauled the stones?

401
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:41,439
They stopped singing 15 years ago.

402
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,247
I thought it would be done so quickly.

403
00:36:44,418 --> 00:36:46,682
And you were only a boy then.

404
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,687
I was a slave then, and I'm still a slave.

405
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,429
<i>Yes, Egypt has changed. </i>

406
00:36:55,596 --> 00:36:57,757
<i>Changed because of the pyramid. </i>

407
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:01,561
<i>To build a tomb to house
one man in his second life... </i>

408
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:04,899
<i>... thousands are finding misery in this life. </i>

409
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:07,167
<i>Pharaoh has changed too. </i>

410
00:37:07,341 --> 00:37:09,707
<i>He has riches, power... </i>

411
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:12,107
<i>... even the son he desired. </i>

412
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,976
<i>But he is like a man obsessed. </i>

413
00:37:18,286 --> 00:37:20,015
I never came here before.

414
00:37:20,187 --> 00:37:22,485
The guards would not let me, Father.

415
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,558
Why do you keep it locked up?

416
00:37:26,928 --> 00:37:29,897
Gold is desired by every man, my son.

417
00:37:30,064 --> 00:37:32,464
There are many who would rob me of this...

418
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:36,091
...take from me what I have
accumulated for my second life.

419
00:37:36,604 --> 00:37:40,165
But all this is mine and will stay mine.

420
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,208
And when my tomb is finished and sealed...

421
00:37:43,377 --> 00:37:46,608
...it will be mine while the
earth stands, till the end of time.

422
00:37:46,781 --> 00:37:49,181
You're hurting me, father.

423
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,578
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:55,779
My lord, forgive me for disturbing you,
but it is time for the boy to go to bed.

425
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:58,482
I was my fault. I forgot the time.

426
00:37:58,659 --> 00:38:00,627
Come on, Xenon.

427
00:38:01,228 --> 00:38:03,287
Thank you, father.

428
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:18,401
You call yourselves builders.

429
00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:20,410
I want no more excuses.

430
00:38:20,581 --> 00:38:26,144
No more old women's tales of why
this won't be done or can't be done.

431
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,912
It will be done.

432
00:38:28,089 --> 00:38:31,286
or you'll go to the quarries
yourselves, all of you.

433
00:38:31,459 --> 00:38:33,723
I'll teach you the meaning of work.

434
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:37,455
In the next month, one complete
level of the stones will be raised.

435
00:38:37,631 --> 00:38:39,724
- It cannot be done.
- You are near the top.

436
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:43,700
- There are fewer stones on each level.
- But the stones must be raised higher.

437
00:38:43,871 --> 00:38:46,567
And because the nearby
quarries are almost exhausted...

438
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,971
...the stones must be
brought a greater distance.

439
00:38:49,143 --> 00:38:51,543
- Always some reason...
- The man is right, sire.

440
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:53,111
You too, Hamar?

441
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,942
Are you telling me that what
I ask for cannot be done?

442
00:38:56,117 --> 00:38:57,584
only with more workers, sire.

443
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,980
I'll get more.

444
00:38:59,153 --> 00:39:01,747
We don't have supplies to
feed a new army of labor, sire.

445
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,153
If you have sufficient, will
there be any more excuses?

446
00:39:05,326 --> 00:39:06,816
None, sire.

447
00:39:06,994 --> 00:39:09,519
- And you?
- None, sire.

448
00:39:09,697 --> 00:39:13,758
I'll get men. And I'll get food.

449
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:19,004
Ambassador of the land of the Amorites.

450
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:25,240
Mighty Pharaoh, 700 head of cattle
have been brought to you by our people.

451
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,374
The decree is not yet fulfilled.

452
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:29,982
Two thousand measures of
grain were also called for.

453
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:31,743
Why have you not brought the rest?

454
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:34,114
In lieu of the grain,
of which we have none...

455
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,779
...my ruler sends you 500 weights of silver.

456
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,415
I am content. Note that
the decree is fulfilled.

457
00:39:40,594 --> 00:39:41,993
The next.

458
00:39:42,163 --> 00:39:44,631
Ambassador of the tributary
province of Cyprus.

459
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:51,735
Ambassador of the tributary
province of Cyprus.

460
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,998
What is this? Who answers for Cyprus?

461
00:39:55,176 --> 00:39:56,905
I do.

462
00:39:57,178 --> 00:39:58,406
Who are you?

463
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:00,877
I am Nellifer, Princess of Cyprus.

464
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,647
Why did you not answer when you were called?

465
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,446
This is the first time I
have served as an ambassador.

466
00:40:06,887 --> 00:40:09,253
The duties are new and strange to me.

467
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,218
You are young for such a role, princess.

468
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,426
Perhaps my lord would
prefer it if I were old.

469
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:21,598
We are only interested in
the tribute that you bring.

470
00:40:21,769 --> 00:40:24,329
What tax was decreed for
the province of Cyprus?

471
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,338
Two thousand measures of
grain, a thousand of oil...

472
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,499
...and of cattle, 800 head.

473
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,939
What have you brought?

474
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:34,343
Nothing, my lord. I came
in place of the tribute.

475
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,985
You came in its place?

476
00:40:39,153 --> 00:40:40,381
Yes, my lord.

477
00:40:40,554 --> 00:40:42,647
- Why?
- My country is poor.

478
00:40:42,823 --> 00:40:44,814
To pay the tribute, some of us must starve.

479
00:41:00,474 --> 00:41:02,567
Starving?

480
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:06,177
You do not have the appearance of starving.

481
00:41:06,347 --> 00:41:09,282
If I do not please you, you may send me back.

482
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:13,409
It will be a great burden to my
country, but your tribute will be paid.

483
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:16,055
- If that is what you wish.
- I could have both.

484
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:18,157
No, my lord, not both.

485
00:41:18,325 --> 00:41:21,385
You may choose between me and
the tribute from my father.

486
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,189
I said I could have both.

487
00:41:23,364 --> 00:41:26,458
And I said not both, but you may choose.

488
00:41:26,634 --> 00:41:28,932
You have much to learn, princess.

489
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:31,230
And we will start your education now.

490
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,373
See that she is securely locked up...

491
00:41:33,541 --> 00:41:36,374
...and her father notified
that payment is demanded.

492
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,408
I do not allow brawling in my court.

493
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,578
Take them both away. Lash the
slave to teach him manners.

494
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,519
one moment, my lord.

495
00:41:50,691 --> 00:41:53,285
Would you punish a slave for merely obeying?

496
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,587
I told him to act.

497
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,493
See that they are both lashed.

498
00:42:00,668 --> 00:42:05,537
And give her her cloak, that she
may hide her starved appearance.

499
00:42:08,075 --> 00:42:09,474
You took it from me.

500
00:42:09,643 --> 00:42:12,134
It is mine no longer.

501
00:42:18,652 --> 00:42:20,210
Now the next.

502
00:42:20,387 --> 00:42:22,821
The ambassador of Al-Hasa.

503
00:42:56,023 --> 00:42:58,821
Bring the girl Nellifer to my room.

504
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,144
In the presence of Pharaoh, you kneel.

505
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,849
All right, you can go.

506
00:43:37,631 --> 00:43:42,034
Education is sometimes painful, isn't it?

507
00:43:51,011 --> 00:43:52,239
Drink this.

508
00:43:52,413 --> 00:43:54,938
Do I stay, or do you want the tribute?

509
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:56,605
Both.

510
00:44:00,521 --> 00:44:02,113
Don't ever do that again.

511
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:28,173
I'll offer you wine just once more.

512
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,551
And I will only take it when you have chosen.

513
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,244
It's the only way, my lord.

514
00:44:51,505 --> 00:44:55,635
<i>In the succeeding weeks, she
became the favorite of the Pharaoh. </i>

515
00:44:55,809 --> 00:44:58,141
<i>They were married and she
became his second wife. </i>

516
00:44:58,312 --> 00:44:59,711
Sit here, my lady.

517
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,905
I have provided sport for your amusement.

518
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,481
What form of sport, my lord?

519
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:07,552
A test of strength between myself
and another living god of Egypt.

520
00:45:07,721 --> 00:45:09,552
You shall see.

521
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:29,756
I have heard many stories, my lord,
of the treasure you have gathered.

522
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:33,263
They probably lie, because no man
could have as much as they say.

523
00:47:33,433 --> 00:47:35,333
They do not lie.

524
00:47:35,502 --> 00:47:39,802
But they only guess,
because none have seen it.

525
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,203
And I may not see it?

526
00:47:44,578 --> 00:47:48,344
Yes. Yes, you shall judge
whether the stories are true.

527
00:47:48,515 --> 00:47:50,745
You shall see for yourself.

528
00:47:53,754 --> 00:47:55,187
Well?

529
00:47:55,355 --> 00:47:57,380
You were right, my lord.

530
00:47:57,558 --> 00:48:00,925
Those that speak of the treasure do not lie.

531
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:03,924
But their stories do not do it justice.

532
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:06,793
You wish to know how they were
won or where they came from?

533
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:10,903
No. only to see it and to feel it.

534
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:12,595
Just like a woman.

535
00:48:12,773 --> 00:48:16,436
- Would you change me, sire?
- No, no, never.

536
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:20,836
Feels almost soft, like
something to be caressed.

537
00:48:21,014 --> 00:48:23,380
only gold feels that way.

538
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:26,986
Words from my own mouth. We are much alike.

539
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,351
If you like it, take it. Take what you want.

540
00:48:30,857 --> 00:48:33,485
I will thank you when I have chosen.

541
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,456
It's all so beautiful.

542
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:39,465
What lies beyond that door?

543
00:48:39,633 --> 00:48:42,796
That is my own domain. I alone go there.

544
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:46,633
I have taken my son, my priest, no others.

545
00:48:46,807 --> 00:48:49,571
And I may not enter?

546
00:48:51,778 --> 00:48:53,439
Yes, yes, you may.

547
00:48:53,614 --> 00:48:56,811
Captain, bring a torch,
that she may see the better.

548
00:48:56,984 --> 00:48:59,612
I want you to see what I've chosen.

549
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,930
It's unbelievable.

550
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:15,601
It's even more beautiful than that outside.

551
00:49:15,769 --> 00:49:18,363
For this, I fought hard and long.

552
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:21,666
I shed my blood and the blood
of those who followed me.

553
00:49:21,842 --> 00:49:25,005
What I have chosen here represent...

554
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:28,144
Take off those jewels.

555
00:49:28,315 --> 00:49:29,543
- What?
- Take them off.

556
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,479
- But I would have this, sire.
- No.

557
00:49:31,652 --> 00:49:33,381
But my lord told me to choose.

558
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,716
Not of this. of that outside.

559
00:49:36,957 --> 00:49:39,289
You may choose what you like of that.

560
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:41,188
But all this must stay as it is.

561
00:49:41,361 --> 00:49:44,296
Until the time when it's removed
to the pyramid, to my tomb.

562
00:49:44,464 --> 00:49:47,524
All? Surely not all for one man.

563
00:49:47,701 --> 00:49:52,400
All. The contents of this room
are the symbols of my life to come.

564
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,267
They are not for this life.

565
00:49:54,441 --> 00:49:58,138
Not to adorn my body or
yours or any living thing.

566
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:02,408
Take off those jewels.

567
00:50:03,183 --> 00:50:05,174
Yes, my lord.

568
00:50:05,352 --> 00:50:06,842
Well, what is it?

569
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,511
Sire, certain of your guests are departing.

570
00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,057
- The high priest suggests that you return...
- All right, I am coming.

571
00:50:13,226 --> 00:50:16,889
May I stay a little, sir. that I
may see better all that is yours?

572
00:50:17,064 --> 00:50:18,497
Yes, come when you've finished.

573
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:21,691
- See that all is secure.
- Yes, sire.

574
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:33,903
What is your name, captain?

575
00:50:34,915 --> 00:50:36,610
Treneh, my lady.

576
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:39,183
And your duties, captain?

577
00:50:39,586 --> 00:50:43,386
I'm charged by Pharaoh with the
security of his treasures, my lady.

578
00:50:43,557 --> 00:50:48,051
Guarding all the Pharaoh's treasures
is a great responsibility, captain.

579
00:50:48,228 --> 00:50:49,957
Yes, my lady.

580
00:50:50,397 --> 00:50:51,728
What if I were to take this?

581
00:50:53,233 --> 00:50:55,167
You heard the Pharaoh's orders.

582
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:57,769
Then you must take it from me.

583
00:50:58,338 --> 00:51:00,397
Remember your duty, captain.

584
00:51:21,628 --> 00:51:23,562
I wish it were mine to give.

585
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:26,893
Unfortunately, it is not.

586
00:51:47,717 --> 00:51:51,244
<i>Now also the quarries are becoming exhausted. </i>

587
00:51:51,421 --> 00:51:54,288
<i>Great holes have been cut in the earth. </i>

588
00:51:54,991 --> 00:51:57,516
<i>It is well that the work
is nearly completed... </i>

589
00:51:57,694 --> 00:52:01,960
<i>... as each day the gathering of
the stone becomes more difficult. </i>

590
00:52:17,714 --> 00:52:21,206
<i>Now too, the finer stone for the
outer covering of the pyramid... </i>

591
00:52:21,718 --> 00:52:24,482
<i>... is being brought from remote
quarries on the upper Nile. </i>

592
00:52:56,753 --> 00:52:58,084
Good evening, my lady.

593
00:52:58,254 --> 00:53:00,017
Good evening, captain.

594
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:02,249
You may go, Mabuna.

595
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:06,255
You sent for me, my lady.

596
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:08,624
That is right, captain.

597
00:53:08,798 --> 00:53:10,823
May I ask why?

598
00:53:11,534 --> 00:53:13,263
Need there be a reason?

599
00:53:13,436 --> 00:53:15,563
No, I presume not.

600
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,166
Would you have some wine, captain?

601
00:53:18,341 --> 00:53:20,104
No, thank you.

602
00:53:24,647 --> 00:53:27,673
You seem nervous and afraid.

603
00:53:27,851 --> 00:53:29,375
Why?

604
00:53:29,552 --> 00:53:31,452
Perhaps because you are Queen of Egypt.

605
00:53:32,489 --> 00:53:34,923
Even a queen may be lonely.

606
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:37,924
Perhaps that's why I asked you to come.

607
00:53:39,028 --> 00:53:40,359
That would make a difference.

608
00:53:40,530 --> 00:53:43,055
Then you are no longer afraid?

609
00:53:44,901 --> 00:53:46,459
No.

610
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,214
- Well, Senta?
- I'd like to talk to you, sir.

611
00:54:07,390 --> 00:54:09,756
I was just stopping anyhow.

612
00:54:12,128 --> 00:54:14,119
- You've finished your work?
- Until tomorrow.

613
00:54:14,297 --> 00:54:16,561
The planning for the
inner part of the pyramid?

614
00:54:16,733 --> 00:54:18,132
Not yet. I wish it were.

615
00:54:18,301 --> 00:54:19,666
There is a lot to be done yet.

616
00:54:19,836 --> 00:54:22,066
- Is that what you wanted to talk about?
- No, sir.

617
00:54:22,238 --> 00:54:24,172
Found this old scarab today.

618
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:27,605
Perhaps you can tell me
what the inscription means.

619
00:54:28,444 --> 00:54:30,969
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't.

620
00:54:31,981 --> 00:54:33,209
That's strange.

621
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:36,181
You yourself gave it to me years
ago and told me its history.

622
00:54:36,352 --> 00:54:37,944
I must have forgotten all about it.

623
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:40,385
You do not work nights anymore. Why?

624
00:54:40,557 --> 00:54:43,492
Don't hide things from me,
sir. You just can't see.

625
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,184
I've been noticing it for months.

626
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:48,489
- Is it all that apparent?
- only to one who knows you.

627
00:54:50,133 --> 00:54:53,967
I'm an old man now, Senta.
Faculties begin to go.

628
00:54:54,137 --> 00:54:55,502
It's all right in the daytime.

629
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:58,368
But at night, by torchlight,
I can't see things close to.

630
00:54:58,541 --> 00:55:00,532
The light in the pyramid comes from torches.

631
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:03,838
How will you work? Read your own
figures, do what you have to do?

632
00:55:04,013 --> 00:55:06,641
- I shall find a way.
- You start your actual work soon.

633
00:55:06,816 --> 00:55:08,044
How is that to be done?

634
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:11,550
I go to the palace tonight to
receive my instructions from Pharaoh.

635
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:13,951
Whatever those may be, you will need help.

636
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:16,216
You are offering to give it to me? No, Senta.

637
00:55:16,392 --> 00:55:17,984
No one need know what you tell me.

638
00:55:18,161 --> 00:55:21,187
Don't you realize what would
happen if anyone suspected you knew?

639
00:55:21,364 --> 00:55:22,456
- I do.
- Well?

640
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:26,363
You need help. Your work depends on
it. our people's freedom depends on you.

641
00:55:26,536 --> 00:55:27,969
The boy's right, vashtar.

642
00:55:28,137 --> 00:55:30,901
Are you asking me to choose
between my son and our people?

643
00:55:31,674 --> 00:55:37,135
What happens to our people and your son if
you fail to fulfill your part of the bargain?

644
00:55:38,414 --> 00:55:40,177
I don't know.

645
00:55:41,084 --> 00:55:42,949
It's settled, then.

646
00:55:43,453 --> 00:55:46,445
I'll only accept your help if
I can think of no other way.

647
00:55:46,623 --> 00:55:49,524
A man thinks best on a full stomach.

648
00:55:54,597 --> 00:55:56,292
Greetings, Pharaoh.

649
00:55:56,466 --> 00:56:00,266
Architect, I understand that you're ready
to start work on the inner labyrinth...

650
00:56:00,436 --> 00:56:02,063
...the secret part of my tomb.

651
00:56:02,238 --> 00:56:03,466
That is true, my lord.

652
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:07,337
I've given considerable thought as
to the method of doing this work...

653
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:10,001
...so that the secret will remain ours.

654
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:11,771
Yes, my lord.

655
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:13,848
These men are your assistants.

656
00:56:14,984 --> 00:56:18,215
They are priests, and they
may be trusted completely.

657
00:56:18,388 --> 00:56:21,949
They have been well
schooled to work in stone.

658
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:27,119
You will obey the orders of the architect
as though they were mine. Understood?

659
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:31,794
Their tongues have been cut out...

660
00:56:31,968 --> 00:56:35,199
...so that even in their sleep
they will not betray the secret.

661
00:56:35,371 --> 00:56:37,635
- They will die when we die.
- So many?

662
00:56:37,807 --> 00:56:40,401
And they are volunteers, so
spare me any humane speeches.

663
00:56:40,576 --> 00:56:42,976
You trust no vows, not even
those of your own faith?

664
00:56:43,146 --> 00:56:45,979
No. I have not gone as far as
this, done what I have done...

665
00:56:46,149 --> 00:56:49,778
...to risk betrayal by any man,
not even my own flesh and blood.

666
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:51,419
I see.

667
00:56:51,587 --> 00:56:55,387
Now, as to the workers, the
men who do the actual labor...

668
00:56:55,558 --> 00:56:58,925
...they will be blindfolded and
led into the pyramid by these men.

669
00:56:59,095 --> 00:57:02,690
on their way out, their
eyes will again be covered.

670
00:57:02,865 --> 00:57:06,426
So they won't know where they've been
or where in the pyramid they've worked.

671
00:57:06,602 --> 00:57:08,399
That at least sounds logical.

672
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:09,970
Have you any suggestions?

673
00:57:10,139 --> 00:57:13,267
You seem to have thought
of everything, my lord.

674
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:15,272
Then the work will begin tomorrow.

675
00:57:15,445 --> 00:57:19,472
oh, and, Hamar, see that these men
have the best of food and wine...

676
00:57:19,649 --> 00:57:24,416
...slaves and pleasure when
their daily work is done.

677
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:30,156
Your goodness and charity
have pleased them, my lord.

678
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:34,490
Well, see that your work pleases me as well.

679
00:57:41,537 --> 00:57:43,903
No man must loosen his blindfold.

680
00:57:44,073 --> 00:57:47,975
The penalty for knowing the way
to the inner chamber is death.

681
00:57:49,212 --> 00:57:51,510
This man's working with me.

682
00:57:52,515 --> 00:57:55,507
Make sure your blindfolds are tight.

683
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:14,568
- Why are we stopping?
- Never mind.

684
00:58:23,412 --> 00:58:26,176
Slip your blindfold a
minute, Senta. Go carefully.

685
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:29,716
This is a further test to
determine if the workers can see.

686
00:58:30,019 --> 00:58:33,284
- They think of everything, don't they?
- There are many traps like this.

687
00:58:33,456 --> 00:58:35,549
You'll need to remember them.

688
00:59:03,052 --> 00:59:06,180
No. No, that stone goes in
later, when you finish both sides.

689
00:59:06,355 --> 00:59:07,913
Do you understand?

690
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:09,853
I'll come back.

691
00:59:18,801 --> 00:59:21,861
Carefully. There are three steps here.

692
00:59:27,643 --> 00:59:29,838
Lift your blindfold a minute.

693
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,041
This is the beginning of the labyrinth.

694
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:36,344
Most of these passages are only to deceive.

695
00:59:36,719 --> 00:59:38,687
We go on this way.

696
00:59:50,933 --> 00:59:52,958
You may remove your blindfold now.

697
00:59:53,135 --> 00:59:56,866
But do not leave under any
circumstances without putting it on.

698
00:59:57,974 --> 01:00:00,306
This room is the exact
center of the pyramid...

699
01:00:00,476 --> 01:00:03,502
...and will be the key to the
device for sealing the tomb.

700
01:00:03,679 --> 01:00:06,079
When the trigger is released
in the burial chamber...

701
01:00:06,249 --> 01:00:09,082
The stone will slide down
that ramp into this room...

702
01:00:09,252 --> 01:00:12,915
...and set in motion forces that
will spread throughout the pyramid.

703
01:00:13,823 --> 01:00:18,021
Now, you'll begin the
construction on that wall there...

704
01:00:18,361 --> 01:00:21,626
...according to these plans here, as you see.

705
01:01:23,559 --> 01:01:26,858
All ready down here. Start it up slowly.

706
01:01:27,163 --> 01:01:28,926
Up slowly.

707
01:01:39,408 --> 01:01:42,241
- Senta.
- Yes, sir.

708
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:46,108
What is this figure and this angle?

709
01:01:46,282 --> 01:01:49,115
The figure is six. The
angle is three divisions.

710
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:51,310
Thank you. I am going to the upper chamber.

711
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,318
I should be back in about an hour.

712
01:01:53,489 --> 01:01:55,423
We have plenty to do.

713
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:57,752
You'd better get up there, both of you.

714
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:00,487
See that the stone is securely fastened.

715
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:22,108
- Where is the architect vashtar?
- He left through that passage, sire.

716
01:02:22,284 --> 01:02:25,447
- Where does that lead to?
- We are not told, sire.

717
01:02:50,913 --> 01:02:52,904
Get this off my leg.

718
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:54,640
Roll out.

719
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:57,614
Help me up.

720
01:03:08,431 --> 01:03:12,527
You have a bad cut. I'll stop the bleeding.

721
01:03:13,436 --> 01:03:14,664
Get some help.

722
01:03:14,837 --> 01:03:18,102
There isn't any help. The
mute priests are finished.

723
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:21,209
It will be an hour before
some of the others get back.

724
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:25,905
Tell me if I get it too tight.

725
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:31,014
It'll stop the bleeding for a while.

726
01:03:31,187 --> 01:03:34,122
You'll have to get out of here.
Can you walk if I help you?

727
01:03:34,290 --> 01:03:36,417
It's no use. We can't
get out of the labyrinth.

728
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:39,356
- I don't remember the way.
- I do.

729
01:03:39,595 --> 01:03:40,926
You?

730
01:03:41,097 --> 01:03:42,928
See if you can walk.

731
01:03:46,068 --> 01:03:48,593
Who are you that know the secret of my tomb?

732
01:03:48,771 --> 01:03:50,671
I am a son of vashtar.

733
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,068
Then you are also aware...

734
01:03:52,241 --> 01:03:55,369
Yes, I know the penalty
of knowing the secret.

735
01:04:06,055 --> 01:04:09,491
Enough of this. Stop fussing about nothing.

736
01:04:09,658 --> 01:04:12,627
It's only a wound. This isn't
the first time it's ever happened.

737
01:04:12,795 --> 01:04:16,595
Do something useful. Get me
a stick so that I can walk.

738
01:04:21,170 --> 01:04:24,936
Young man, today you saved my life.

739
01:04:25,107 --> 01:04:29,134
And I am not fool enough to think it
was done because of loyalty to me...

740
01:04:29,311 --> 01:04:32,542
...but rather because of your
loyalty to vashtar the architect.

741
01:04:32,715 --> 01:04:36,173
For when I die, he dies
too. Is that the reason?

742
01:04:36,352 --> 01:04:37,751
That was the only reason.

743
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:40,388
And you learned the secret
of the labyrinth from him.

744
01:04:40,556 --> 01:04:43,491
- I know it, that should be sufficient.
- No, it is not.

745
01:04:43,659 --> 01:04:46,127
I believe that vashtar's
sight is failing, sire.

746
01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:49,423
- Undoubtedly, they've shared the secret.
- Is this true?

747
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:52,465
Come now, if his sight is going,
it will be easy to find out.

748
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:54,967
- His eyes are failing.
- Young man...

749
01:04:55,137 --> 01:04:56,968
...I am asking you these questions...

750
01:04:57,139 --> 01:05:00,506
...to justify myself in allowing
you to live while I live.

751
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:03,668
And to allow you to assist
vashtar until the work is done.

752
01:05:03,846 --> 01:05:06,178
- I take it that's what you want.
- That's true, sir.

753
01:05:06,348 --> 01:05:09,249
Well, it merely means that
one more will die when I die.

754
01:05:09,418 --> 01:05:13,218
However, I must feel that
the secret is safe with you.

755
01:05:13,389 --> 01:05:15,721
To be sure that you know
the fate of your people...

756
01:05:15,891 --> 01:05:17,552
...if that secret is revealed.

757
01:05:17,726 --> 01:05:20,320
- I know only too well.
- I believe you do.

758
01:05:20,496 --> 01:05:22,930
And I believe I can take that risk.

759
01:05:23,098 --> 01:05:26,261
Thus, since you saved my life,
while I live, you shall live well.

760
01:05:26,435 --> 01:05:29,131
- A palace, slaves, gold, anything...
- I live with my people.

761
01:05:29,305 --> 01:05:31,239
I prefer to continue that way.

762
01:05:31,407 --> 01:05:33,671
vashtar raised you, that's obvious.

763
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:36,072
Ask any reward and you
shall have it instantly.

764
01:05:36,245 --> 01:05:38,645
Anything within my power to grant.

765
01:05:38,814 --> 01:05:41,647
- Except one thing.
- There's nothing that...

766
01:05:41,817 --> 01:05:44,342
Clumsy fool! Look what you've done.

767
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:46,044
I am sorry, my lord.

768
01:05:46,222 --> 01:05:49,589
This bottle contained a perfume
which you yourself gave me.

769
01:05:49,758 --> 01:05:51,919
This stupid slave has
broken it. I was angry...

770
01:05:52,094 --> 01:05:53,322
I did not break it.

771
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:56,555
You see? She is also
insolent and slow to obey.

772
01:05:56,732 --> 01:05:59,132
I'm not a slave of yours or anyone.

773
01:05:59,301 --> 01:06:02,099
Silence. She will learn
manners and to obey orders.

774
01:06:02,271 --> 01:06:04,364
I am not a slave. I will not obey.

775
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,100
If she does not, see that
she is whipped until she does.

776
01:06:07,276 --> 01:06:09,801
- Take her away.
- My lord, give me this slave.

777
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:12,379
You told me that what I
wanted would be given me.

778
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:13,810
The girl is mine, my lord.

779
01:06:13,983 --> 01:06:15,951
You passed judgment. Let it be fulfilled.

780
01:06:16,118 --> 01:06:18,348
"Ask any reward and you
shall have it instantly. "

781
01:06:18,520 --> 01:06:21,785
Those were your words,
sire. I ask for the girl.

782
01:06:21,957 --> 01:06:23,185
Take her.

783
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,122
What manner of judgment is this?

784
01:06:25,294 --> 01:06:28,695
- You give me a slave and then you take it...
- Be still. I've given my word.

785
01:06:28,864 --> 01:06:31,890
You have slaves enough for
your amusement, mistress.

786
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:33,466
Judgment here is mine...

787
01:06:33,636 --> 01:06:36,503
...to be decreed as I see
fit and altered as I see fit.

788
01:06:36,672 --> 01:06:38,435
Is that understood?

789
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:39,869
Yes, my lord.

790
01:06:40,509 --> 01:06:43,410
Take the girl, Senta, and go. She's yours.

791
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:45,410
Thank you, sire.

792
01:06:58,994 --> 01:07:00,655
Don't you understand?

793
01:07:00,829 --> 01:07:02,922
Had that man not saved the Pharaoh...

794
01:07:03,098 --> 01:07:05,589
...had he died today or if
he were to die tomorrow...

795
01:07:05,768 --> 01:07:06,996
...what would I be?

796
01:07:07,169 --> 01:07:09,137
- You are his wife.
- No.

797
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:11,796
only his second wife.

798
01:07:11,974 --> 01:07:16,502
Today, he made a fool of me before
the real wife and the whole court.

799
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:19,910
And if he were to die, I would
be nothing, have nothing...

800
01:07:20,082 --> 01:07:22,107
...unless I were queen.

801
01:07:22,284 --> 01:07:23,979
What are you trying to tell me?

802
01:07:24,153 --> 01:07:25,677
That Queen Nailla must die.

803
01:07:29,158 --> 01:07:30,523
No, no. No, Nellifer.

804
01:07:30,693 --> 01:07:32,786
- Look at me, Treneh.
- I'm afraid to.

805
01:07:32,961 --> 01:07:34,895
Afraid of what I see in your face.

806
01:07:35,064 --> 01:07:36,531
You want me, don't you?

807
01:07:36,699 --> 01:07:39,429
Wouldn't you like to share
with me what would be mine?

808
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,865
Not like that. We dare not.

809
01:07:42,037 --> 01:07:45,302
Look at me. You say you love me.

810
01:07:45,474 --> 01:07:47,772
Then you must choose for us both.

811
01:07:47,943 --> 01:07:52,277
or for yourself, while you are
afraid to see what you see in my face.

812
01:07:53,115 --> 01:07:55,413
Look at me and choose.

813
01:07:55,584 --> 01:07:59,145
Either I am yours and you help me...

814
01:07:59,321 --> 01:08:01,687
...or I go on without you.

815
01:08:02,825 --> 01:08:04,850
Which is it to be?

816
01:08:12,101 --> 01:08:14,069
I'm glad it will be this way.

817
01:08:14,703 --> 01:08:17,228
Now we must plan.

818
01:08:17,506 --> 01:08:21,272
Tomorrow I shall start by
making a friend of the queen.

819
01:08:21,443 --> 01:08:24,378
Whatever we do, it will be
dangerous with the Pharaoh here.

820
01:08:24,546 --> 01:08:28,607
Then you must see that he goes
away while it is being done.

821
01:08:33,689 --> 01:08:36,522
There's no use you just
sitting there saying nothing.

822
01:08:37,526 --> 01:08:38,959
What's your name, anyway?

823
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:40,755
Kyra.

824
01:08:41,397 --> 01:08:43,297
What part of our country do you come from?

825
01:08:43,465 --> 01:08:47,162
- Mekio.
- Young lady, by any chance, can you cook?

826
01:08:47,336 --> 01:08:49,031
- of course I can cook.
- Well...

827
01:08:49,204 --> 01:08:50,865
But I won't.

828
01:08:51,173 --> 01:08:56,440
Senta, you say Pharaoh offered you
a palace and fine food and wines.

829
01:08:56,612 --> 01:08:59,479
And you refused him, and took her instead.

830
01:08:59,648 --> 01:09:02,208
You drive a shrewd bargain.

831
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:05,109
Look, why don't you stop sulking?

832
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:07,288
Don't you realize they were gonna whip you?

833
01:09:07,456 --> 01:09:08,787
- Then I'm not your slave?
- No.

834
01:09:08,957 --> 01:09:11,949
Whoever heard of a slave having a slave?

835
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:25,206
- Is this what you have been eating?
- Every day.

836
01:09:25,374 --> 01:09:27,342
- Have you any black pepper?
- Yes.

837
01:09:27,509 --> 01:09:30,307
- And a little garlic.
- Yes.

838
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:32,413
- And bay leaves?
- Yes.

839
01:09:32,581 --> 01:09:35,744
And some rice, and mint, and sugar for cakes?

840
01:09:35,918 --> 01:09:38,546
Yes, but if we haven't, I'll soon get it.

841
01:09:41,156 --> 01:09:43,920
Maybe you didn't do so badly after all.

842
01:09:57,072 --> 01:10:00,303
- Greetings, my lord priest.
- Greetings, captain.

843
01:10:01,343 --> 01:10:03,072
Well, captain?

844
01:10:03,345 --> 01:10:06,576
My lord, I thought this might interest you.

845
01:10:12,921 --> 01:10:14,650
How did you come by this, captain?

846
01:10:14,823 --> 01:10:18,020
Came from one of the workmen on the
pyramid. one of the new arrivals.

847
01:10:18,193 --> 01:10:20,957
- A slave with such treasure?
- Yes, sire.

848
01:10:21,129 --> 01:10:24,826
He came to me because he was very ill.
He hopes to buy his freedom with that.

849
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,297
Where did he get this?

850
01:10:26,468 --> 01:10:28,868
He said it came from his native land of Tiba.

851
01:10:29,037 --> 01:10:30,629
Then he told me of a tomb.

852
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:34,537
A tomb which was found under the sand
in a valley, near the village of Byblos.

853
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:38,202
He said the tomb contained a vast
treasure which this is only a small thing.

854
01:10:38,380 --> 01:10:40,348
- Has any of this been reported?
- No, sire

855
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,279
Where is the man now?

856
01:10:42,451 --> 01:10:44,612
Unfortunately, he died
during the night, sire.

857
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:48,278
I cannot vouch for him, this
statue is the only proof.

858
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:52,951
- Where is the rest of the treasure?
- According to the slave it's still in the tomb.

859
01:10:53,128 --> 01:10:55,426
A small force could
reach Byblos in five days.

860
01:10:55,597 --> 01:10:57,758
Sooner the better. Slave
could have told others.

861
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:00,060
Possibly. That's why I
came to you immediately.

862
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:03,227
My lord, the wound in your leg
has not yet completely healed.

863
01:11:03,405 --> 01:11:06,966
The exercise will do it
good. I'll go tomorrow.

864
01:11:07,342 --> 01:11:10,675
- You've done well, captain.
- Thank you, sire.

865
01:11:51,553 --> 01:11:52,884
May I come in?

866
01:11:53,055 --> 01:11:55,956
- Good evening, Nellifer.
- Good evening, Your Majesty.

867
01:11:56,124 --> 01:11:59,184
- Good evening, Xenon.
- Good evening, Lady Nellifer.

868
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:01,158
I've brought a present for Xenon.

869
01:12:01,330 --> 01:12:04,891
- Do you hear that, Xenon?
- What did you bring me?

870
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:08,935
- Is it a flute?
- Not just a flute, a magic flute.

871
01:12:09,104 --> 01:12:11,937
And when you learn to play
it, it will do amazing things.

872
01:12:12,107 --> 01:12:16,066
- Will you show me how?
- You sit down and I'll show you now.

873
01:12:17,312 --> 01:12:19,678
Now, watch carefully.

874
01:12:50,345 --> 01:12:51,642
It is very pretty.

875
01:12:51,813 --> 01:12:54,873
If I learn to play it,
what magic will it bring?

876
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:59,683
When you learn then you shall
see. Now, I'll do it again.

877
01:13:44,166 --> 01:13:47,294
The cobra will always come
to the sound of the flute.

878
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,198
You've done well.

879
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:52,101
Bring the snake in a strong basket.

880
01:13:52,908 --> 01:13:55,376
Be careful that no one sees you.

881
01:14:20,736 --> 01:14:22,829
Xenon, it is time for you to go to bed.

882
01:14:23,271 --> 01:14:28,607
- Just a little while, please?
- very well, but just for a few minutes.

883
01:15:57,132 --> 01:16:00,727
It's very nice, Xenon. Just keep on playing.

884
01:16:05,574 --> 01:16:08,907
Don't stop. Just keep on playing.

885
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:15,643
You better go, quickly.

886
01:16:15,817 --> 01:16:17,944
And don't come back tonight.

887
01:16:28,363 --> 01:16:30,888
Such a cruel way to die.

888
01:16:31,066 --> 01:16:34,035
She was so gentle, so kind.

889
01:16:34,202 --> 01:16:37,899
- What a terrible accident.
- And the young prince was not harmed?

890
01:16:38,073 --> 01:16:41,270
oh, no, my lord. The
queen's body protected him.

891
01:16:41,443 --> 01:16:43,707
Can you account for what happened?

892
01:16:44,512 --> 01:16:47,606
The serpent must have been
drawn to the music of the flute.

893
01:16:47,782 --> 01:16:50,114
We all encouraged him to learn to play it.

894
01:16:50,285 --> 01:16:54,187
Even the queen herself, after
Lady Nellifer gave it to him.

895
01:16:54,356 --> 01:16:57,223
You say Lady Nellifer gave it to him?

896
01:16:57,392 --> 01:17:00,759
Yes, she seemed very fond of him.

897
01:17:00,929 --> 01:17:03,727
Who could have foreseen
that this would happen?

898
01:17:03,899 --> 01:17:07,027
- You may go now.
- Yes, my lord.

899
01:17:19,447 --> 01:17:21,381
My lady.

900
01:17:22,217 --> 01:17:23,878
My lady.

901
01:17:33,094 --> 01:17:36,120
- I told you not to come back here tonight.
- It was necessary.

902
01:17:36,298 --> 01:17:40,826
- Hamar sent a messenger to Pharaoh.
- I'm not surprised, it's his duty to do so.

903
01:17:41,002 --> 01:17:45,166
Also, Your Majesty, he has sent
men to every city in the kingdom.

904
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:48,070
To question any man who deals with serpents.

905
01:17:48,243 --> 01:17:51,337
Every fakir, every handler of snakes.

906
01:17:51,513 --> 01:17:53,947
- He suspects, then.
- Why else should he do it?

907
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:56,174
That is dangerous.

908
01:17:56,451 --> 01:17:58,919
We must be rid of the
man who gave us the snake.

909
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:00,645
Mabuna will silence him.

910
01:18:00,822 --> 01:18:02,881
- Mabuna...
- No, wait, I have a better plan.

911
01:18:03,658 --> 01:18:06,058
Where will Hamar's
messenger find the Pharaoh?

912
01:18:06,227 --> 01:18:09,321
At the oasis of Solaar. But
what good will that do you to go?

913
01:18:09,497 --> 01:18:11,988
- If Hamar finds...
- I will not go, Mabuna will go.

914
01:18:12,167 --> 01:18:13,395
- What?
- Why not?

915
01:18:13,568 --> 01:18:15,763
With Pharaoh dead, let
Hamar learn what he can.

916
01:18:15,937 --> 01:18:17,962
- Because then I shall rule in Egypt.
- But...

917
01:18:18,139 --> 01:18:20,573
Mabuna will not fail. Will you, Mabuna?

918
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:22,039
No, my lady.

919
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,007
Do you agree?

920
01:18:24,612 --> 01:18:27,672
- Yes.
- Then tell him the way.

921
01:18:28,583 --> 01:18:32,576
The oasis is near the border
of Tiba. on the road to Byblos.

922
01:18:41,863 --> 01:18:44,058
The queen is dead.

923
01:18:46,167 --> 01:18:48,294
It's hard to believe.

924
01:18:49,337 --> 01:18:51,362
I should not have left.

925
01:18:51,539 --> 01:18:55,771
- You're sure my son was not harmed?
- only badly frightened, sire.

926
01:18:56,478 --> 01:18:58,343
We leave for Luxor at dawn.

927
01:18:58,513 --> 01:19:01,311
See that the men rest and the
camels are ready to start then.

928
01:19:01,483 --> 01:19:04,577
- Yes, sire.
- Leave me, all of you.

929
01:20:12,087 --> 01:20:13,611
Guard!

930
01:20:14,055 --> 01:20:15,647
Guard!

931
01:20:16,991 --> 01:20:19,391
Who are you? Why did you?

932
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:30,137
You're Nellifer's slave.

933
01:20:30,305 --> 01:20:32,398
Who told you to do this? Speak.

934
01:20:32,574 --> 01:20:34,769
Who told you? Was it her doing?

935
01:20:34,943 --> 01:20:37,377
Did she order it? Did she?

936
01:20:39,180 --> 01:20:43,514
This slave tried to kill
me. I want to know why.

937
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:47,280
Well, just don't stand there. Make him talk.

938
01:20:47,889 --> 01:20:50,016
He's got to talk.

939
01:20:51,459 --> 01:20:53,984
The man is dead, sire.

940
01:20:56,831 --> 01:21:01,291
only a few knew where I
was. She was one of them.

941
01:21:02,170 --> 01:21:05,162
- Be careful, sire, the wound is not serious...
- I know that.

942
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:07,035
- But you must not...
- Bandage it well.

943
01:21:07,208 --> 01:21:10,974
You, prepare the fastest
camels. I ride for Luxor tonight.

944
01:21:11,146 --> 01:21:13,876
- But sire, your wound...
- I'm the best judge of that.

945
01:21:14,048 --> 01:21:16,278
Do as you're ordered, at once.

946
01:21:18,786 --> 01:21:20,185
Do you remember?

947
01:21:20,355 --> 01:21:23,813
You said to me once, "If
it were mine to give... "

948
01:21:23,992 --> 01:21:28,019
It is not yet mine to
give. But you wanted it.

949
01:21:30,965 --> 01:21:33,490
I wanted it for a long time.

950
01:21:33,668 --> 01:21:36,762
- Now it is yours.
- Yes.

951
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:39,771
Soon, all will be mine.

952
01:21:39,941 --> 01:21:43,433
- Mabuna should be back tonight.
- Before morning.

953
01:21:44,078 --> 01:21:46,137
Unless he fails.

954
01:21:47,448 --> 01:21:50,212
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

955
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:53,320
I suddenly felt cold as if...

956
01:21:53,488 --> 01:21:55,046
As though...

957
01:21:56,090 --> 01:21:58,422
What is the old saying?

958
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:03,288
As though someone walked on your grave.

959
01:22:04,132 --> 01:22:07,499
Hold me. Tight.

960
01:22:17,378 --> 01:22:21,075
- What's that?
- Camels.

961
01:22:22,817 --> 01:22:25,411
A small troop of camels.

962
01:22:37,832 --> 01:22:40,062
Stay here, all of you.

963
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:04,382
The camels are part of Pharaoh's bodyguard.

964
01:23:04,559 --> 01:23:06,686
They could be bringing word.

965
01:23:10,431 --> 01:23:12,058
You must go.

966
01:23:12,233 --> 01:23:15,794
You shouldn't be here. Something tells...

967
01:23:27,849 --> 01:23:30,409
Why do you come and see me
when the Pharaoh is gone?

968
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:33,952
Even my slave is not
here. Is that your doing?

969
01:23:34,122 --> 01:23:36,682
Did you send him away? Answer me!

970
01:23:36,858 --> 01:23:39,656
oh, by the gods. You shall
answer to Pharaoh when he returns.

971
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:43,024
- He shall answer to me now.
- oh, my lord.

972
01:23:43,197 --> 01:23:46,655
- Traitor, coward.
- Sire.

973
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:49,928
You were afraid to strike with your own hand.

974
01:23:50,104 --> 01:23:54,768
- Let me speak, sire.
- Now you shall die by mine.

975
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:27,224
So should all traitors die.

976
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:32,365
Nellifer, Nellifer.

977
01:25:33,574 --> 01:25:37,203
- Yes, my lord?
- Call Hamar.

978
01:25:37,378 --> 01:25:39,005
Quickly.

979
01:25:41,249 --> 01:25:43,342
Yes, my lord.

980
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:24,988
You were badly hurt, sire.

981
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:27,218
I am dying.

982
01:26:28,563 --> 01:26:30,997
Call Hamar, I must talk to him.

983
01:26:32,266 --> 01:26:33,858
I've already called him.

984
01:26:35,736 --> 01:26:38,330
Come closer, so that I can see your face.

985
01:26:43,244 --> 01:26:44,973
Nellifer.

986
01:26:45,446 --> 01:26:47,880
I thought it was your doing.

987
01:26:48,049 --> 01:26:50,040
Because your slave attacked me.

988
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:56,453
- I'm glad it was not.
- Yes, my lord.

989
01:26:59,427 --> 01:27:02,419
Not both, you said. Remember?

990
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:07,090
Not both. Choose.

991
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:12,099
over and over again, you said, "Choose. "

992
01:27:13,107 --> 01:27:15,007
And I chose.

993
01:27:15,476 --> 01:27:18,502
And now, you are my queen.

994
01:27:21,616 --> 01:27:23,641
Where is Hamar?

995
01:27:24,352 --> 01:27:26,752
He is coming, sire.

996
01:27:27,622 --> 01:27:29,817
We've not much time.

997
01:27:31,092 --> 01:27:34,653
I am dying, and you are to live.

998
01:27:35,162 --> 01:27:38,063
I ask only one thing of you.

999
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:41,901
Promise that I shall be buried as I planned.

1000
01:27:43,337 --> 01:27:45,032
Promise me.

1001
01:27:45,273 --> 01:27:47,867
Yes, I promise.

1002
01:27:48,442 --> 01:27:50,842
That's all I ask.

1003
01:27:51,178 --> 01:27:53,203
Just that you...

1004
01:27:55,883 --> 01:27:57,942
What is this?

1005
01:27:58,653 --> 01:28:02,714
There is only one way you
could have come by this.

1006
01:28:03,324 --> 01:28:05,952
- So it was you!
- Yes.

1007
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:07,355
And you can know now.

1008
01:28:07,828 --> 01:28:10,797
I planned it all and it's
turned out as I hoped it would.

1009
01:28:10,965 --> 01:28:12,398
And do you hear that?

1010
01:28:12,567 --> 01:28:15,536
I told you once that your
treasure was too much for one man.

1011
01:28:15,970 --> 01:28:18,438
And do you hear that too?

1012
01:28:18,806 --> 01:28:22,242
You think that you will cheat me?

1013
01:28:22,410 --> 01:28:28,406
You think that I shall not
live long enough to see you die?

1014
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:30,011
You will see.

1015
01:28:34,221 --> 01:28:35,848
Guard.

1016
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:37,982
Guard.

1017
01:28:39,193 --> 01:28:40,717
Hamar.

1018
01:28:41,462 --> 01:28:43,293
I need you.

1019
01:28:43,731 --> 01:28:45,289
Help me.

1020
01:29:14,195 --> 01:29:15,457
You were right.

1021
01:29:15,630 --> 01:29:17,291
- He's dead.
- Are you sure?

1022
01:29:17,465 --> 01:29:21,196
The heralds are going through
the city telling the people.

1023
01:29:22,303 --> 01:29:25,602
- May he find peace.
- How did he die, Mikka?

1024
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,874
They didn't say.

1025
01:29:29,043 --> 01:29:32,501
I didn't expect it so suddenly. Did you, sir?

1026
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:34,545
No, I didn't.

1027
01:29:34,715 --> 01:29:37,445
I thought we'd finish our
work, our people would go free.

1028
01:29:37,618 --> 01:29:39,916
And we would have a number
of years still to live.

1029
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:41,685
You must go.

1030
01:29:41,856 --> 01:29:43,790
Both of you. Now, before they come.

1031
01:29:44,492 --> 01:29:46,119
No, Kyra.

1032
01:29:46,293 --> 01:29:49,057
If we were to run now, all
we've worked for would be lost.

1033
01:29:49,230 --> 01:29:51,391
Don't be frightened,
nothing can happen to us...

1034
01:29:51,565 --> 01:29:53,294
...until our task is completed.

1035
01:29:53,467 --> 01:29:55,094
How much remains to be done?

1036
01:29:56,370 --> 01:29:57,962
Not very much.

1037
01:30:06,881 --> 01:30:08,576
- Hamar.
- Yes, my prince?

1038
01:30:08,749 --> 01:30:13,550
- Must we wait for Queen Nellifer, Hamar?
- It is your duty, my prince.

1039
01:30:13,721 --> 01:30:15,985
I am afraid I'm going to cry.

1040
01:30:16,157 --> 01:30:19,593
- I don't want them to see me.
- oh, no, no, my prince.

1041
01:30:19,760 --> 01:30:21,227
You will not cry.

1042
01:30:21,395 --> 01:30:24,853
- You're your father's son.
- Yes, Hamar.

1043
01:30:33,941 --> 01:30:36,432
We share each other's sorrow, Prince Xenon.

1044
01:30:39,146 --> 01:30:41,706
Thank you. May I go now, Hamar?

1045
01:30:41,882 --> 01:30:43,873
Yes, my prince.

1046
01:30:52,626 --> 01:30:56,027
It is my wish that the doors to
the treasure vaults be opened.

1047
01:30:56,197 --> 01:30:58,427
It shall be as you wish, Your Majesty.

1048
01:31:24,759 --> 01:31:28,092
What is all this? All the
doors are open, it's gone.

1049
01:31:28,262 --> 01:31:31,288
- Where is the treasure?
- In that place for which it was destined.

1050
01:31:31,465 --> 01:31:32,727
The tomb in the pyramid.

1051
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:35,027
- By whose orders?
- By Pharaoh's orders.

1052
01:31:35,202 --> 01:31:37,796
It's quite safe, Your Majesty.
His own guards protect it.

1053
01:31:37,972 --> 01:31:40,463
It is I now who decides
what is safe in Egypt.

1054
01:31:40,641 --> 01:31:42,905
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Have it brought here at once.

1055
01:31:43,077 --> 01:31:47,104
When you are in fact the queen, you
will be obeyed, by myself, as by all.

1056
01:31:47,281 --> 01:31:49,181
What do you say? That I'm not the queen?

1057
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:52,945
According to the laws of Egypt, when
you have given burial to Pharaoh...

1058
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,954
...when his body is laid within the
tomb, you will inherit all that was his.

1059
01:31:57,124 --> 01:31:59,285
The treasure, the power, the state.

1060
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:02,224
Until then, the will of the Pharaoh lives on.

1061
01:32:02,396 --> 01:32:05,729
The treasure remains in
the tomb. That is the law.

1062
01:32:05,900 --> 01:32:09,597
- When is the burial?
- According to custom, 30 days from now.

1063
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:13,001
- And then I rule in Egypt.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

1064
01:32:13,174 --> 01:32:14,607
one more thing.

1065
01:32:14,775 --> 01:32:17,335
Why did you allow me to come
down here to find this out?

1066
01:32:17,511 --> 01:32:21,174
Shall we say I would save her
majesty from being told in public?

1067
01:32:22,716 --> 01:32:27,016
My lord priest, I'm well aware
of your hostility and enmity.

1068
01:32:27,188 --> 01:32:29,383
May I say that the feeling is mutual.

1069
01:32:29,657 --> 01:32:30,646
Within 30 days, I...

1070
01:32:30,825 --> 01:32:33,817
A long time ago, Your Majesty, I made a pact.

1071
01:32:33,994 --> 01:32:36,827
I swore to be buried
with my friend and ruler.

1072
01:32:36,997 --> 01:32:41,263
Therefore, madam, when you
are queen, I will not be here.

1073
01:32:41,435 --> 01:32:44,563
And you no longer need to worry about me.

1074
01:32:53,714 --> 01:32:56,581
- Mikka.
- Yes, vashtar?

1075
01:32:57,151 --> 01:33:00,245
Perhaps it's time we talked of a few plans.

1076
01:33:01,388 --> 01:33:05,620
Now, yours will be the responsibility of
leading our people home across the desert.

1077
01:33:05,793 --> 01:33:08,159
See they carry with them
only what is necessary.

1078
01:33:08,329 --> 01:33:10,729
Many will be tempted to
take more than they should.

1079
01:33:10,898 --> 01:33:12,763
Have they told you when we may go?

1080
01:33:12,933 --> 01:33:16,596
Hamar has promised that you're to
be freed when Pharaoh is buried.

1081
01:33:16,770 --> 01:33:18,761
Two days from now.

1082
01:33:19,640 --> 01:33:24,304
vashtar, you've never told me or
our people and we ought to know.

1083
01:33:24,478 --> 01:33:27,208
How are you and Senta to?

1084
01:33:27,381 --> 01:33:30,578
- What is to be the manner of?
- I don't know.

1085
01:33:30,751 --> 01:33:34,050
I believe that Hamar intends to
be sealed in the tomb with Pharaoh.

1086
01:33:34,221 --> 01:33:35,882
He and the mute priests.

1087
01:33:36,056 --> 01:33:39,048
I can only presume it will be
the same for Senta and myself.

1088
01:33:39,226 --> 01:33:41,558
- But he hasn't told you it'll be so.
- Not yet.

1089
01:33:41,729 --> 01:33:44,664
Tomorrow, I'm to show him the
device for sealing the tomb.

1090
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,993
Perhaps we shall know then.

1091
01:34:03,150 --> 01:34:06,347
- Please, Kyra, don't.
- We have so little time.

1092
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,488
- So little...
- I know, my darling, I know.

1093
01:34:09,423 --> 01:34:12,358
Hold me, hold me close to you.

1094
01:34:19,266 --> 01:34:22,929
My lord priest, yesterday Senta asked
me a question that I could not answer.

1095
01:34:23,103 --> 01:34:25,435
- Maybe you would?
- Certainly, if I can.

1096
01:34:25,606 --> 01:34:28,632
These boats, sir. What are they for?

1097
01:34:28,909 --> 01:34:31,742
They are solar boats, for
Pharaoh to use after his burial.

1098
01:34:32,446 --> 01:34:36,746
They are the means by which Pharaoh will
journey across the skies with the sun.

1099
01:34:36,917 --> 01:34:38,976
With the god Horus.

1100
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:41,811
Each day they will sail from east to west.

1101
01:34:41,989 --> 01:34:45,982
And each night Pharaoh will return to the
east by the river which runs under the earth.

1102
01:34:46,160 --> 01:34:48,060
I see.

1103
01:34:48,429 --> 01:34:51,865
Again, you'll probably
not agree with our beliefs.

1104
01:35:02,676 --> 01:35:08,205
- Tell me, vashtar, what remains to be done?
- only the setting of the mechanism.

1105
01:35:08,382 --> 01:35:10,577
Apart from that, our work is finished.

1106
01:35:10,751 --> 01:35:14,118
You remember the stone we lowered for
Pharaoh and you, so many years ago?

1107
01:35:14,288 --> 01:35:17,849
- very well.
- This is exactly the same.

1108
01:35:18,125 --> 01:35:21,185
When those bits of earthenware are
broken, the sand will run out...

1109
01:35:21,362 --> 01:35:23,762
...and the cover of the
sarcophagus will be lowered.

1110
01:35:23,931 --> 01:35:25,330
While it's coming down...

1111
01:35:25,499 --> 01:35:28,866
...the lever will release a stone
in the chamber beneath this one.

1112
01:35:29,036 --> 01:35:32,369
That stone will set in motion all
the forces for sealing the pyramid.

1113
01:35:32,539 --> 01:35:33,767
How long will it take?

1114
01:35:33,941 --> 01:35:37,502
Within a few moments of that cover
coming down, every passage will be closed.

1115
01:35:37,678 --> 01:35:40,670
- only this room will remain.
- Are you certain of this?

1116
01:35:40,848 --> 01:35:43,817
once that starts down, no power
on Earth can stop the rest.

1117
01:35:43,984 --> 01:35:45,417
That will be the end.

1118
01:35:45,586 --> 01:35:49,215
You have done well, vashtar. very well.

1119
01:35:49,390 --> 01:35:51,756
You have lived up to your bargain.

1120
01:35:52,292 --> 01:35:55,227
Now as to our part of the bargain...

1121
01:35:56,096 --> 01:35:59,793
...I will give orders that when
the burial procession starts...

1122
01:35:59,967 --> 01:36:02,265
...your people will be released.

1123
01:36:02,436 --> 01:36:05,599
Those orders will include both of you.

1124
01:36:05,773 --> 01:36:08,105
You may lead your people home.

1125
01:36:08,275 --> 01:36:10,505
- You mean that...
- Yes, my friends.

1126
01:36:10,677 --> 01:36:13,043
There is no need for either of you to die.

1127
01:36:13,213 --> 01:36:15,807
When the tomb is sealed,
the secret evaporates.

1128
01:36:15,983 --> 01:36:19,111
When it's solid stone, what does
the way through the labyrinth matter?

1129
01:36:20,587 --> 01:36:25,786
I will believe always, or choose
to believe, you planned it this way.

1130
01:36:26,527 --> 01:36:28,552
I also believe...

1131
01:36:29,296 --> 01:36:32,094
...Pharaoh would approve of what I'm doing.

1132
01:36:33,634 --> 01:36:36,068
Will you set the mechanism now?

1133
01:36:49,850 --> 01:36:51,909
People of Egypt.

1134
01:36:52,686 --> 01:36:57,214
In this moment, our Pharaoh puts
down the burden of this life.

1135
01:36:58,459 --> 01:37:03,556
Let his lawful successor now claim
the power and the glory that was his.

1136
01:37:04,998 --> 01:37:07,990
Are you, Nellifer, prepared to do this?

1137
01:37:08,235 --> 01:37:14,140
I, Nellifer, wife to Pharaoh,
as regent for his son and heir...

1138
01:37:14,308 --> 01:37:16,640
...do assume the burden he has put down.

1139
01:37:16,810 --> 01:37:20,974
Are you then prepared to give him burial
according to our laws and customs...

1140
01:37:21,148 --> 01:37:24,640
...that you may inherit that which was his?
- I am prepared.

1141
01:37:24,818 --> 01:37:26,877
For the last time...

1142
01:37:27,054 --> 01:37:30,251
...we will pay homage to our Pharaoh.

1143
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:37,976
All is ready, Your Majesty.

1144
01:39:52,699 --> 01:39:55,862
You must give the order, Your Majesty.

1145
01:39:57,371 --> 01:39:59,635
The order is given.

1146
01:40:58,598 --> 01:41:00,691
It is done, Your Majesty.

1147
01:41:00,867 --> 01:41:06,237
Then, I, Nellifer, am now
queen of Egypt. And I order...

1148
01:41:11,478 --> 01:41:15,744
- What is this?
- The tomb is being sealed, Your Majesty.

1149
01:41:15,916 --> 01:41:17,406
oh, no.

1150
01:41:20,654 --> 01:41:22,178
No.

1151
01:41:28,795 --> 01:41:30,524
Show me the way out, I command you.

1152
01:41:30,697 --> 01:41:32,597
- Show me the way.
- There's no way out.

1153
01:41:32,766 --> 01:41:35,894
This is what you lied and
schemed and murdered to achieve.

1154
01:41:36,069 --> 01:41:39,596
- This is your kingdom.
- No, no!

1155
01:42:23,316 --> 01:42:26,649
I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die!

1156
01:42:28,288 --> 01:42:32,725
I don't want to die, please help me!

1157
01:42:32,893 --> 01:42:35,327
I don't want to die.

1158
01:43:06,793 --> 01:43:08,556
So it's finished.

1159
01:43:08,728 --> 01:43:12,061
A structure to house one man and
the greatest treasure of all time.

1160
01:43:12,232 --> 01:43:16,168
- And a structure to last for all time.
- only history will tell that.

1161
01:43:16,336 --> 01:43:19,635
- Will he be remembered?
- I don't think I'll ever forget him.

1162
01:43:19,806 --> 01:43:21,535
Yes, he'll be remembered.

1163
01:43:21,708 --> 01:43:23,903
The pyramid will keep his memory alive.

1164
01:43:24,077 --> 01:43:26,375
And that he built better than he knew.

1165
01:43:26,546 --> 01:43:29,572
Come, we have a long way to go.

1166
01:44:04,484 --> 01:44:06,475
