1
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:54,036
We will breakfast?

2
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:58,332
I'm tired of the beach.

3
00:03:58,874 --> 00:04:01,210
Filipa, go find your brother and sister.

4
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,677
Do not be difficult. Eat or you will not have dessert.

5
00:04:10,928 --> 00:04:12,846
Pass me the plate of Antônio.

6
00:04:14,932 --> 00:04:17,809
Here. Antonio, at the table!

7
00:04:18,977 --> 00:04:20,395
'll Get me a juice.

8
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:23,315
- Come on, eat.
- I like it.

9
00:04:27,945 --> 00:04:29,655
We must eat everything!

10
00:04:30,155 --> 00:04:32,616
- It's yucky.
- It's good for health.

11
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,077
I'll tell Mom.

12
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,753
I can have?

13
00:05:04,356 --> 00:05:07,442
You could wash your plate from time to time.

14
00:05:07,901 --> 00:05:10,904
I never do. Why do you ask me suddenly?

15
00:05:11,154 --> 00:05:14,700
Doing the dishes you would do no harm.

16
00:05:15,951 --> 00:05:18,328
- I'll leash.
- "Ah, yes!

17
00:05:26,503 --> 00:05:30,924
Children! I offer a mirror to the one who will do the dishes!

18
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,260
- I do!
- No, me!

19
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:34,803
Gently!

20
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:38,223
And your book, Mathias?

21
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:39,433
Nice going.

22
00:05:41,185 --> 00:05:45,397
Liar! You have not written anything this week!

23
00:05:47,316 --> 00:05:48,317
Seriously!

24
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,153
I was watching.

25
00:05:52,487 --> 00:05:54,990
No, we're getting there. Thank you.

26
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:00,495
You're wrong. You know I want you to succeed.

27
00:06:00,746 --> 00:06:02,372
We were wrong!

28
00:06:03,665 --> 00:06:07,169
I just do not identify with his characters.

29
00:06:07,377 --> 00:06:10,756
Which characters? I am curious to know.

30
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:15,135
These existentialists who only ...

31
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:18,347
turn around, tormented by desire.

32
00:06:21,683 --> 00:06:26,313
Your sarcasm goes along with your charm, my heart.

33
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:28,273
Thank you, my love.

34
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:32,528
- You're adorable.
- Nothing.

35
00:06:35,239 --> 00:06:36,323
Excuse me.

36
00:06:39,701 --> 00:06:43,872
Filipa, you bring me a whiskey? It is full of water.

37
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:46,250
Finishes first one, Clarice.

38
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,584
No, but ...

39
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:52,923
A whiskey please.

40
00:06:54,174 --> 00:06:56,593
- For you?
- No, for my mother.

41
00:06:57,845 --> 00:07:00,013
- It's there?
- "Yes.

42
00:07:01,014 --> 00:07:02,182
OK.

43
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,643
(Sec)

44
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:08,230
She prefers over ice.

45
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:10,899
A lot of sugar?

46
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:16,947
Thank you.

47
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,694
- Truth or Dare, Isabel?
- Truth.

48
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:57,863
You are a virgin?

49
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,281
Yes.

50
00:08:01,366 --> 00:08:02,451
It's true!

51
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,371
Go ahead, make the turn.

52
00:08:07,748 --> 00:08:09,500
Juliana, a question for Arthur.

53
00:08:11,543 --> 00:08:13,253
Who is the prettiest girl here?

54
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,131
Go!

55
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,258
Answer!

56
00:08:19,176 --> 00:08:20,594
Come, answer!

57
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,138
Answer!

58
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:28,936
Filipa!

59
00:08:32,606 --> 00:08:34,441
You do not kiss?

60
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:35,817
Shut up.

61
00:08:35,943 --> 00:08:37,486
Oh sissy!

62
00:08:43,075 --> 00:08:44,159
Filipa Rodrigo.

63
00:08:46,286 --> 00:08:48,372
Who is the best guy here?

64
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:50,999
I can not answer!

65
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,835
Go!

66
00:08:53,043 --> 00:08:55,838
- It's a silly question!
- You will have a pledge.

67
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:01,385
You have to kiss on the mouth Arthur.

68
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:03,178
In the middle.

69
00:09:05,848 --> 00:09:07,057
Go!

70
00:09:07,307 --> 00:09:10,435
A kiss, a kiss!

71
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:15,691
Wow, look!

72
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,442
As they are serious!

73
00:09:22,865 --> 00:09:24,575
How cute!

74
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:27,369
Adorable!

75
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,000
- Cool!
- You've seen their head?

76
00:09:35,627 --> 00:09:36,837
It was worth it.

77
00:09:40,257 --> 00:09:41,425
Is for you.

78
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:43,969
Thank you.

79
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:52,269
It's my agent.

80
00:09:53,395 --> 00:09:54,897
What does he want?

81
00:09:55,647 --> 00:09:59,026
Paulão Portela wants to buy the rights to my last book.

82
00:09:59,443 --> 00:10:00,777
Fun, no?

83
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:02,863
It makes you a good offer?

84
00:10:03,071 --> 00:10:04,114
In what sense?

85
00:10:04,656 --> 00:10:06,116
Viewpoint money.

86
00:10:06,617 --> 00:10:08,285
This is not what counts.

87
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:10,120
What?

88
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,539
You know we need money.

89
00:10:13,457 --> 00:10:15,626
We can not talk with you.

90
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,383
No, your worries are artistic,

91
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,429
mine are pragmatic, as our overdraft.

92
00:10:28,096 --> 00:10:32,643
Paulão is a lousy producer. I did not sell the rights.

93
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:34,019
Period.

94
00:10:35,729 --> 00:10:39,775
You'll never understand this kind of thing. Never!

95
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,627
- It's nice, eh?
Yes

96
00:11:43,922 --> 00:11:46,383
You were already coming?

97
00:11:46,508 --> 00:11:47,551
Yes.

98
00:11:47,676 --> 00:11:48,677
With whom?

99
00:11:49,303 --> 00:11:50,429
My friends.

100
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:02,065
Look, the waves form a triangle

101
00:12:02,774 --> 00:12:06,195
in the rocks.

102
00:12:07,029 --> 00:12:08,030
It's beautiful.

103
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,168
You saw the turtles, there?

104
00:12:21,376 --> 00:12:22,377
No, where?

105
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,380
You do not see them? There are two huge!

106
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:26,840
I see nothing!

107
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,051
There, just below us.

108
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:31,803
I see nothing ...

109
00:12:45,651 --> 00:12:46,902
I do not know ...

110
00:12:47,653 --> 00:12:51,365
I keep the house from the beach, and you, the apartment in Sao Paulo.

111
00:12:51,907 --> 00:12:53,075
Why?

112
00:12:53,575 --> 00:12:55,953
This house suits me more than you.

113
00:12:56,411 --> 00:13:00,582
You're too lazy to take care of a house beside the sea

114
00:13:01,834 --> 00:13:06,421
It's crazy, just to hurt me excuse thee.

115
00:13:09,633 --> 00:13:10,843
Excuse me.

116
00:13:14,096 --> 00:13:16,473
I do not even know how we arrived there.

117
00:13:16,723 --> 00:13:17,766
Exactly.

118
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:20,853
We will not separate, no?

119
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:23,730
It depends on you.

120
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:26,733
Me? Or you, Clarice?

121
00:13:28,819 --> 00:13:30,779
Two of us, Mathias.

122
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,240
Well, we'll see.

123
00:13:34,324 --> 00:13:35,325
We'll see.

124
00:13:36,243 --> 00:13:37,411
A little?

125
00:13:40,038 --> 00:13:40,998
Cuckoo.

126
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:42,541
Cuckoo.

127
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:46,420
I am Okay.
- "Of course!"

128
00:13:46,628 --> 00:13:47,713
To us.

129
00:14:31,465 --> 00:14:33,467
You want a brother? I'll rent one.

130
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:34,676
No, true!

131
00:14:35,052 --> 00:14:37,179
You've already one. And not just any!

132
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:40,933
A little brother that I can be on my knees.

133
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:42,142
I'll buy one.

134
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:43,936
No, I want a real one.

135
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,146
Ah, that's my little prince!

136
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:47,356
Forgiveness.

137
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:53,320
We sing Happy Birthday?

138
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:54,530
Go!

139
00:14:55,572 --> 00:14:57,282
Hear me all!

140
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,577
We will sing Happy Birthday

141
00:15:01,328 --> 00:15:04,248
the most wonderful boy here now.

142
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:27,813
Go ahead

143
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,701
Filipa!

144
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:45,414
I want to talk to you.

145
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:47,082
Later.

146
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,127
Seriously, I talk to you.

147
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,336
I told you no.

148
00:15:51,503 --> 00:15:53,046
It will not take long. I have something to say.

149
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:54,882
Let me

150
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:08,061
- What happened?
- I do not like it.

151
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,356
And then? It does not give you the right to abuse them.

152
00:16:11,565 --> 00:16:12,941
Be nicer.

153
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:15,319
You're not nice with dad, you.

154
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:18,822
Do not talk like that.

155
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:21,158
- I will speak as I want.
No.

156
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,494
If you do that again, you will be punished ...

157
00:16:33,629 --> 00:16:36,215
Remember? I love this song.

158
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:39,259
- Come, Clarice.
No.

159
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:41,929
Come on!

160
00:16:42,262 --> 00:16:43,722
She dances very well.

161
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:25,824
I am Okay.

162
00:18:31,371 --> 00:18:32,289
No.

163
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,795
Hello,

164
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:12,764
Hello, Dad.

165
00:20:18,187 --> 00:20:19,646
Could you pass me the coffee?

166
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,148
Fernanda, a banana?

167
00:20:21,356 --> 00:20:22,357
No.

168
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:26,904
- Are you sure?
- Well, okay.

169
00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:29,740
Eat, Antônio.

170
00:20:30,532 --> 00:20:31,867
No, too!

171
00:20:40,042 --> 00:20:42,377
What is it? It does not?

172
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:43,962
I'm not hungry.

173
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:46,548
Really? Come on, open your mouth.

174
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:47,758
I go to the beach.

175
00:20:47,925 --> 00:20:49,927
At the beach? Now?

176
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:53,680
She is angry with you? You have played?

177
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:55,682
No.

178
00:20:58,602 --> 00:21:00,395
You've played with it?

179
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:03,023
No, it is she who fights with me.

180
00:21:03,273 --> 00:21:04,274
Liar.

181
00:21:06,652 --> 00:21:09,238
You, you do not dispute. You're an angel.

182
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:10,364
Thank you, Dad.

183
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,038
You wanted me?

184
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:19,873
The other day, yes.

185
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:21,750
Not anymore.

186
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:23,919
I'll be there.

187
00:21:37,266 --> 00:21:38,433
Well, talk.

188
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:40,936
I ..."

189
00:21:56,618 --> 00:21:58,328
I would go out with you.

190
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:06,128
- Ju, we'll swim?
OK.

191
00:22:19,057 --> 00:22:21,059
Mom, Can I take a picture?

192
00:22:21,435 --> 00:22:23,187
You're a photographer now?

193
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:25,272
I thought it was your sister.

194
00:22:29,067 --> 00:22:30,235
It is good?

195
00:22:32,487 --> 00:22:34,740
I took a picture of Mom for you.

196
00:22:36,241 --> 00:22:37,242
Thank you.

197
00:22:37,493 --> 00:22:38,494
Why?

198
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,204
Because she is pretty.

199
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:42,331
It's true.

200
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:46,585
But you're much prettier.

201
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:47,836
- "Ah, yes!

202
00:22:50,422 --> 00:22:51,548
Mice.

203
00:22:56,011 --> 00:22:57,763
Go away, little monster!

204
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:27,561
- I saw you at the beach.
- What did you see?

205
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,646
You know it, bitch.

206
00:24:29,897 --> 00:24:30,981
Want one?

207
00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:33,942
Make my bed for a month, or I tell everyone.

208
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:36,695
- We shall see.
- Come back, I do not laugh!

209
00:24:40,741 --> 00:24:42,367
Antônio kissed a girl.

210
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:44,870
She's lying! It was she who kissed a boy.

211
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:46,955
He denied because she is pregnant.

212
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:49,082
Shut up, liar!

213
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,375
Go ...

214
00:24:50,959 --> 00:24:52,753
It knows? It is already coming here?

215
00:24:54,004 --> 00:24:56,131
- It's true that she is pregnant?
- She lies!

216
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,842
Well, okay, we change the subject.

217
00:24:59,885 --> 00:25:01,970
- Oh, I have news.
What is it?"

218
00:25:02,763 --> 00:25:05,057
Dad's book will be adapted to television.

219
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:07,726
Not so fast!

220
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:12,272
This is not true!

221
00:25:16,276 --> 00:25:17,277
Maybe ...

222
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,365
It is not clear yet.

223
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:22,950
Rather yes or no?

224
00:25:25,118 --> 00:25:26,328
Ask your father.

225
00:25:26,537 --> 00:25:27,663
Daddy!

226
00:25:27,913 --> 00:25:29,790
Your mother talks too!

227
00:25:31,708 --> 00:25:32,709
Thank you.

228
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,469
It would be great.

229
00:25:48,976 --> 00:25:50,269
Come here.

230
00:25:50,477 --> 00:25:51,687
Let me go!

231
00:25:58,318 --> 00:25:59,903
I'll tell Mom.

232
00:26:02,072 --> 00:26:04,199
Enough!

233
00:26:06,577 --> 00:26:08,745
- Let me go, Filipa.
- Come!

234
00:26:08,954 --> 00:26:10,664
Mom, Antônio fought.

235
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,374
What does it mean?

236
00:26:12,583 --> 00:26:14,293
He started it.

237
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:18,213
You do not beat you like a little thug.

238
00:26:18,505 --> 00:26:19,756
He hurt you?

239
00:26:21,091 --> 00:26:23,093
- Where is Daddy?
- He is out.

240
00:26:23,302 --> 00:26:25,470
- He went where?
- I do not know, darling.

241
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,390
Watch. You have the arm all red, Antônio.

242
00:27:52,766 --> 00:27:55,310
You scared me!

243
00:27:56,144 --> 00:27:58,856
What are you doing there on the floor?

244
00:27:59,064 --> 00:28:00,440
Like a little monkey.

245
00:28:17,332 --> 00:28:18,542
Goodbye.

246
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,636
Shampoo your mother!

247
00:28:30,137 --> 00:28:32,556
It's okay. We bought the whiskey.

248
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:33,932
What?

249
00:28:34,099 --> 00:28:35,934
Do not talk about your mother like that.

250
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:37,603
She gets drunk all the time.

251
00:28:37,811 --> 00:28:40,105
- You have no right to judge.
You are!

252
00:28:40,355 --> 00:28:41,523
No, you do not.

253
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:45,736
And now, go get the shampoo.

254
00:28:46,403 --> 00:28:47,779
Go!

255
00:28:57,664 --> 00:28:58,665
What happened?

256
00:28:58,874 --> 00:28:59,875
- כלום

257
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:11,553
She was sunbathing by the pool.

258
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:14,348
He joined her, and they have played.

259
00:29:14,556 --> 00:29:17,100
He pulled out a gun and he put two bullets in the head.

260
00:29:17,518 --> 00:29:19,019
It must be a crime of passion.

261
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:21,063
I bet it was a loser.

262
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:23,899
He must have felt threatened.

263
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:27,819
Me, I was more like a macho.

264
00:29:28,237 --> 00:29:32,115
A businessman from Sao Paulo has left his wife and daughter for his mistress.

265
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:38,455
I know that murder is not justified, but I can understand.

266
00:29:38,664 --> 00:29:40,249
- No, Mathias.
- Wait.

267
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:45,087
Jealousy can be dangerous when we can not control more.

268
00:29:45,295 --> 00:29:47,548
A guy like him should be locked up for life.

269
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:50,551
He's a murderer. A murderer is a murderer.

270
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,970
She may be a lover.

271
00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:54,263
Three, four.

272
00:29:54,471 --> 00:29:58,892
If you kill all those who are infidels, the earth will be depopulated.

273
00:29:59,643 --> 00:30:00,727
Not here!

274
00:30:02,855 --> 00:30:04,982
I find that none of jealousy.

275
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,734
Why? You're not jealous?

276
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:11,822
Of course I do, my love. You want me to kill you?

277
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:17,911
- She was pretty!
- I had seen her at the beach.

278
00:30:18,162 --> 00:30:19,163
Really?

279
00:30:20,205 --> 00:30:22,583
They say that the marble was covered with blood.

280
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,960
- Where?
- Here.

281
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:26,587
I know the house.

282
00:30:27,004 --> 00:30:28,505
She had a lover.

283
00:30:28,714 --> 00:30:30,883
My mother also has a lover.

284
00:32:06,687 --> 00:32:09,690
I saw my mother in a car with a guy one day.

285
00:32:09,898 --> 00:32:13,193
- You're not going to tell your father?
- I do not want them separate.

286
00:32:16,989 --> 00:32:19,491
- My father also has a mistress.
- Really?

287
00:32:20,075 --> 00:32:22,494
The American who has a house on the beach.

288
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:24,371
I'll tell my mother.

289
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,082
You want them to separate?

290
00:32:37,593 --> 00:32:38,802
You will do what?

291
00:32:40,137 --> 00:32:41,930
- I told you. I'll work.
- "Yes.

292
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:45,475
You have forgotten why we came here?

293
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:48,937
Certainly not.

294
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,483
You know what you do.

295
00:32:54,735 --> 00:32:56,195
I take Antônio.

296
00:32:57,571 --> 00:32:59,281
Not worth it. It is very well here with me.

297
00:32:59,531 --> 00:33:01,492
No. He fought today.

298
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:04,077
- He took over?
- Is it important?

299
00:33:04,286 --> 00:33:07,539
Sure. I do not know if I should congratulate him or punish him.

300
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:13,295
Your son is macho, like you.

301
00:33:15,255 --> 00:33:19,092
I'm fairly tolerant to a macho, no?

302
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:22,888
I know the limits of your tolerance.

303
00:33:45,869 --> 00:33:47,830
I do not believe in your work history.

304
00:34:51,476 --> 00:34:52,477
Goodbye, kids.

305
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:53,937
Goodbye, Mom.

306
00:34:54,271 --> 00:34:56,148
Be wise, eh?

307
00:35:01,153 --> 00:35:03,864
Mama, do not leave.

308
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:05,407
I'll be back soon.

309
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:09,578
I am Okay.

310
00:36:03,841 --> 00:36:05,384
Damn!

311
00:36:05,592 --> 00:36:07,636
I forgot to refuel.

312
00:36:08,262 --> 00:36:09,221
What do we do?

313
00:36:09,471 --> 00:36:10,722
Nothing. Expected.

314
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:13,475
Eventually someone will pass.

315
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:16,728
With a little luck.

316
00:38:15,264 --> 00:38:17,015
Look what I found.

317
00:38:17,224 --> 00:38:18,350
It's pretty!

318
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,396
Come give me a kiss.

319
00:38:23,355 --> 00:38:24,356
I do not want.

320
00:38:24,982 --> 00:38:26,692
Do not be silly!

321
00:38:28,068 --> 00:38:29,444
Go ahead with a kiss to dad.

322
00:38:32,406 --> 00:38:34,324
Let me

323
00:39:05,397 --> 00:39:07,024
Have you ever made love?

324
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:09,902
Yes.

325
00:39:10,027 --> 00:39:11,278
With whom?

326
00:39:11,487 --> 00:39:12,446
A girl.

327
00:39:13,030 --> 00:39:16,533
Liar. I bet you got never even seen anyone do.

328
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:19,453
You so?

329
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:20,662
Yes.

330
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:44,561
We go home.

331
00:41:58,362 --> 00:41:59,863
I'm tired.

332
00:42:00,405 --> 00:42:02,449
Tired of all these dirty tricks.

333
00:42:04,576 --> 00:42:07,120
I do not want to argue with you!

334
00:42:07,329 --> 00:42:08,622
Orders:

335
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:13,210
You're happy, eh!

336
00:42:13,418 --> 00:42:14,670
Go find it!

337
00:42:14,837 --> 00:42:17,881
Be careful, I could take you at your word.

338
00:42:18,131 --> 00:42:20,300
What are you doing?

339
00:42:20,759 --> 00:42:21,760
Fuck you!

340
00:43:17,316 --> 00:43:18,859
She will win.

341
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:20,861
It will fall.

342
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:24,448
It is stronger than you.

343
00:43:24,948 --> 00:43:28,285
It must blow on the spoon before?

344
00:43:33,707 --> 00:43:35,250
Oh, my book!

345
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:38,212
My book is about separation.

346
00:43:40,172 --> 00:43:41,882
It is entirely appropriate.

347
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,759
Clarice, I beg you.

348
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:46,970
Sorry, just kidding. I have no right?

349
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:48,347
Anyway ...

350
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:53,519
It ... the story of a couple, Otávio and Isadora.

351
00:43:54,478 --> 00:43:58,524
One day, Isadora meets a man ten years her junior.

352
00:43:58,857 --> 00:44:00,108
They have an affair.

353
00:44:00,943 --> 00:44:03,320
At first, they are very discreet.

354
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,158
Isadora did not take their relationship seriously.

355
00:44:08,909 --> 00:44:11,995
But she is married, right? And the husband?

356
00:44:12,579 --> 00:44:16,416
He learns this course. The cuckold always ends know.

357
00:44:17,626 --> 00:44:19,044
They split up?

358
00:44:19,503 --> 00:44:21,505
She would like to, but not him.

359
00:44:21,713 --> 00:44:24,842
Not him? It should not be the opposite?

360
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:29,012
Understand

361
00:44:29,221 --> 00:44:32,474
in a love triangle, the outer component

362
00:44:32,683 --> 00:44:37,771
pushes the other two at the ends they would never have imagined.

363
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,356
- Interesting, no?
- "Yes.

364
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:42,317
My book is about a separation slow

365
00:44:43,443 --> 00:44:47,739
breaks that we do not presents.

366
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:50,617
This is a book on trust.

367
00:44:51,577 --> 00:44:54,872
On the limits not to exceed. You understand?

368
00:44:55,247 --> 00:44:56,248
It looks boring.

369
00:44:56,999 --> 00:44:58,500
Thank you, my heart.

370
00:44:58,709 --> 00:44:59,710
We go to the beach?

371
00:45:00,002 --> 00:45:02,880
- Yes, go to the beach!
- Come on.

372
00:45:04,089 --> 00:45:06,008
In short, it's a comedy!

373
00:45:14,266 --> 00:45:16,059
I'm exhausted.

374
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,979
I do not know what to do!

375
00:45:19,521 --> 00:45:21,398
Clarice, calm down.

376
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:29,573
I'll see Filipa.

377
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,792
It will not, Mom?

378
00:45:42,085 --> 00:45:43,462
Why are you crying?

379
00:45:45,672 --> 00:45:46,965
Because of Dad?

380
00:45:47,841 --> 00:45:51,970
No, that's not it, darling. Go take a real shower.

381
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:07,945
Please, Daddy!

382
00:46:10,197 --> 00:46:12,574
You're too boring lately.

383
00:46:13,408 --> 00:46:14,660
I do not see the report.

384
00:46:14,868 --> 00:46:15,869
I do.

385
00:46:15,994 --> 00:46:20,999
Why I would take a girl boring to a really nice evening? Huh?

386
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:23,877
I promise I will not be boring.

387
00:46:24,086 --> 00:46:25,087
- "Ah, yes!

388
00:46:25,587 --> 00:46:26,630
No.

389
00:46:26,755 --> 00:46:29,633
Please! Be nice!

390
00:46:31,468 --> 00:46:35,389
- I too want to go!
- No. This is my last word.

391
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:39,685
I'll do whatever you want, I'll give you a massage, I ...

392
00:46:39,935 --> 00:46:41,311
- "What else?"

393
00:46:41,937 --> 00:46:45,524
- Come on, please!
- A species of small shrew.

394
00:46:45,816 --> 00:46:47,568
- Super!
- Wait!

395
00:46:49,194 --> 00:46:51,196
We're friends again, then?

396
00:46:52,447 --> 00:46:53,448
What?

397
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,043
Bye!

398
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:50,172
What is it? "You do not amuse yourself?

399
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,465
You are!

400
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:55,636
You do not say anything. You came alone?

401
00:47:55,928 --> 00:47:57,554
No. With my parents.

402
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,848
You're coming with your parents?

403
00:48:01,475 --> 00:48:02,809
How old are you?

404
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:04,019
Fourteen years.

405
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:07,648
I understand better. You're a kid.

406
00:48:09,107 --> 00:48:10,567
What's your name?

407
00:48:11,902 --> 00:48:15,280
Filipa? Well me is Lucas.

408
00:48:42,516 --> 00:48:43,559
Oh, sorry!

409
00:48:44,393 --> 00:48:46,395
- I did not mean to.
- This is not serious.

410
00:48:46,603 --> 00:48:48,689
- I tripped.
- Do not worry.

411
00:48:50,357 --> 00:48:51,358
We're going to dry it.

412
00:48:53,986 --> 00:48:56,321
- It has a stain?
- I do not think so.

413
00:48:56,697 --> 00:48:57,948
I'm sorry.

414
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,242
It's nothing.

415
00:49:03,162 --> 00:49:04,288
What's your name?

416
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:07,291
Magic.

417
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,959
Mine's Angela.

418
00:49:10,878 --> 00:49:12,671
You're the daughter of Mathias?

419
00:49:15,507 --> 00:49:19,761
I like your father. I read all his books.

420
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,643
You do not make up?

421
00:49:29,146 --> 00:49:30,522
Here, put on a little.

422
00:50:12,105 --> 00:50:14,858
What's that mosquito that wakes me?

423
00:50:15,067 --> 00:50:16,735
Orders:
- I'll wake up Mom.

424
00:50:27,788 --> 00:50:29,248
It will not, Mom?

425
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:35,963
It's nothing, darling.

426
00:50:38,048 --> 00:50:39,842
Mom has a headache.

427
00:50:41,844 --> 00:50:43,887
Let me sleep a little.

428
00:50:47,516 --> 00:50:48,976
Go have fun.

429
00:50:49,226 --> 00:50:51,436
I'll prepare breakfast.

430
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:52,771
OK.

431
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:14,293
Thirty-four seconds.

432
00:51:22,551 --> 00:51:23,886
Fifty seconds.

433
00:51:44,323 --> 00:51:45,949
One minute fifty!

434
00:51:46,158 --> 00:51:47,242
I won!

435
00:51:48,494 --> 00:51:49,495
You did what?

436
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:51,038
Make fun of me.

437
00:51:57,669 --> 00:51:59,379
I'm tired of this game

438
00:52:29,326 --> 00:52:31,537
- What are you doing here?
- You can keep a secret?

439
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:34,289
- Yes, why?
- Grab your bike and follow me.

440
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,334
- My bike?
- Yes, hurry.

441
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:57,206
It's your father?

442
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:16,034
That's enough, come on.

443
00:55:22,124 --> 00:55:23,458
See you tomorrow?

444
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:27,546
No.

445
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:30,174
I do not want to go out with you.

446
00:55:34,136 --> 00:55:36,096
Why you took me to see it?

447
00:55:36,763 --> 00:55:37,890
I have no idea.

448
00:55:39,057 --> 00:55:40,475
You gonna tell?

449
00:55:44,563 --> 00:55:45,772
Promise.

450
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,317
I promise.

451
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,198
If you say to someone, my father will kill you.

452
00:56:22,434 --> 00:56:23,435
Mom?

453
00:56:39,117 --> 00:56:40,494
Come out, Antônio.

454
00:56:43,413 --> 00:56:44,790
Go!

455
00:56:55,008 --> 00:56:56,009
Mom.

456
00:56:56,885 --> 00:56:58,428
Awake.

457
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:00,639
Get up, Mom.

458
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:06,436
Go.

459
00:57:07,563 --> 00:57:09,148
He must get up.

460
00:57:28,792 --> 00:57:29,793
Remember!

461
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:27,142
Mom is fine.

462
00:58:30,229 --> 00:58:31,313
She sleeps.

463
00:59:06,431 --> 00:59:08,308
I love you, darling.

464
00:59:09,143 --> 00:59:10,602
You know?

465
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:12,271
Many.

466
00:59:14,106 --> 00:59:15,858
I love all three.

467
00:59:27,411 --> 00:59:29,872
Sometimes, Mom does everything wrong.

468
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,837
I do not like when you drink.

469
00:59:39,715 --> 00:59:41,717
I do not want you to suffer.

470
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:44,636
OK.

471
00:59:49,141 --> 00:59:50,476
Forgive me.

472
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:54,062
OK.

473
00:59:58,066 --> 00:59:59,735
I will stop drinking.

474
01:00:00,819 --> 01:00:01,904
You promise that?

475
01:00:05,157 --> 01:00:06,325
I promise.

476
01:00:26,803 --> 01:00:27,804
Listen.

477
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:31,225
- I have something to say.
- What?

478
01:00:32,518 --> 01:00:36,146
You will learn in any way, so far as I tell you.

479
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:37,356
Go ahead

480
01:00:38,565 --> 01:00:40,192
It's about Juliana.

481
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:44,488
She had sex for the first time.

482
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,076
With Arthur.

483
01:00:54,706 --> 01:00:56,834
- "You want to see him?"

484
01:01:00,337 --> 01:01:02,047
I'm not in love with him.

485
01:01:42,421 --> 01:01:45,924
I returned to Sao Paulo and thou art here to finish your book.

486
01:01:46,675 --> 01:01:47,843
What comes next?

487
01:01:48,844 --> 01:01:51,263
Then we'll see how it is organized.

488
01:01:54,683 --> 01:01:56,977
You seem sure of yourself.

489
01:01:57,895 --> 01:01:59,938
You always accuse me otherwise.

490
01:02:02,524 --> 01:02:04,776
But this time it's different.

491
01:02:04,985 --> 01:02:06,403
What?

492
01:02:08,447 --> 01:02:10,866
We will do it again.

493
01:02:14,786 --> 01:02:17,623
- I do not speak either.
- You see?

494
01:02:23,921 --> 01:02:24,922
And the children?

495
01:02:25,214 --> 01:02:29,134
They already knew something was wrong.

496
01:02:29,968 --> 01:02:32,763
We owe them an explanation.

497
01:02:41,146 --> 01:02:43,315
Do not understand me, Mathias.

498
01:02:43,941 --> 01:02:47,861
You have often spoken of separation, and when I speak, you change your mind.

499
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:49,112
I do not believe.

500
01:02:49,446 --> 01:02:50,447
However, it's real!

501
01:02:50,572 --> 01:02:51,949
You're not serious!

502
01:02:52,199 --> 01:02:54,076
I forbid you to say so!

503
01:02:54,326 --> 01:02:55,786
Sorry, but there it is.

504
01:02:57,955 --> 01:03:00,123
You have lost your impartiality.

505
01:03:00,999 --> 01:03:05,087
True, I lost patience, I lost interest!

506
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:07,172
I lost everything, okay?

507
01:03:11,385 --> 01:03:14,221
I refuse to spend one more night with you.

508
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:20,310
I refuse to spend one more night with you married.

509
01:03:21,645 --> 01:03:23,689
You'll be happier single, too.

510
01:03:28,527 --> 01:03:29,862
I hate you.

511
01:03:36,243 --> 01:03:38,328
Before, you said you loved me.

512
01:03:40,914 --> 01:03:42,374
Was long ago.

513
01:03:50,048 --> 01:03:52,801
We would like to tell you something.

514
01:03:55,053 --> 01:03:58,599
But do not worry, okay?

515
01:03:58,891 --> 01:04:00,767
Nothing will change for you.

516
01:04:05,731 --> 01:04:08,275
Your mother and I are going to live

517
01:04:08,984 --> 01:04:11,778
in different homes.

518
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:15,491
You'll separate yourself?

519
01:04:16,492 --> 01:04:17,784
No. It's temporary.

520
01:04:18,494 --> 01:04:20,621
It will be better for everyone.

521
01:04:20,871 --> 01:04:21,872
I do not think so.

522
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:24,541
Let her.

523
01:04:26,084 --> 01:04:27,836
You speak to him later.

524
01:05:23,433 --> 01:05:24,434
Bye!

525
01:05:26,562 --> 01:05:27,563
I am Okay.

526
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:29,857
Worry a head! Where are you going?

527
01:05:30,691 --> 01:05:31,692
At the beach.

528
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:35,654
I'll go for a sail. You want to come? Climb.

529
01:05:36,029 --> 01:05:37,990
Come, do not worry.

530
01:05:39,032 --> 01:05:40,701
It's risk.

531
01:05:41,118 --> 01:05:42,661
Hang on though.

532
01:06:23,285 --> 01:06:24,495
Look at me.

533
01:06:25,621 --> 01:06:27,247
Turn around.

534
01:06:28,999 --> 01:06:34,004
Since the evening, I want to go out with you.

535
01:06:34,254 --> 01:06:35,797
Look at me. "Kiss me.

536
01:06:41,845 --> 01:06:42,930
Kiss me

537
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:44,640
You are a virgin?

538
01:06:44,848 --> 01:06:46,099
Orders:

539
01:06:48,519 --> 01:06:50,145
Come, come here.

540
01:07:49,997 --> 01:07:51,165
I talk to you.

541
01:07:51,665 --> 01:07:52,749
Not me.

542
01:07:59,089 --> 01:08:00,841
You're the eldest.

543
01:08:01,925 --> 01:08:04,720
You have to understand and help your brother and sister.

544
01:08:05,429 --> 01:08:06,972
I did not understand.

545
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:09,892
Why you react like that?

546
01:08:11,268 --> 01:08:12,769
I know why you left Mom.

547
01:08:13,020 --> 01:08:15,022
- You know nothing.
You are!

548
01:08:20,569 --> 01:08:23,906
You act like a kid. You do not know what you say.

549
01:08:24,531 --> 01:08:26,909
I told you so. I do not believe you.

550
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:32,915
If you do not stop your nonsense, I deprive you of output.

551
01:08:33,123 --> 01:08:34,082
Go ahead

552
01:08:41,173 --> 01:08:43,425
- In your room, immediately.
- No way.

553
01:08:43,634 --> 01:08:46,386
If you want to have a child, I'll treat you like a child.

554
01:08:46,595 --> 01:08:49,264
In your room, immediately!

555
01:08:49,807 --> 01:08:51,141
I never talk to you.

556
01:08:51,350 --> 01:08:52,476
Super. Hello.

557
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:19,211
I do not believe in your work history.

558
01:09:21,713 --> 01:09:22,798
Fuck you!

559
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:16,894
Fernanda, we take a picture.

560
01:10:18,437 --> 01:10:19,897
I do not want.

561
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:24,526
I'll take you.

562
01:10:29,740 --> 01:10:30,991
Come on, smile!

563
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:47,382
Hello, Filipa.

564
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:49,301
I am Okay.

565
01:11:02,189 --> 01:11:04,483
Go ahead
- Put the KO!

566
01:12:10,382 --> 01:12:11,633
Arthur?

567
01:12:12,759 --> 01:12:14,094
I talk to you.

568
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:17,431
I'm listening.

569
01:12:19,099 --> 01:12:20,100
Ju and I know for you.

570
01:12:24,354 --> 01:12:26,315
You said you did not love me.

571
01:12:28,567 --> 01:12:30,068
I lied.

572
01:12:31,278 --> 01:12:32,362
Excuse me.

573
01:13:16,698 --> 01:13:18,408
Mom, I do not want to leave.

574
01:13:19,576 --> 01:13:23,247
The holidays are almost over. It is much obliged.

575
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:26,834
I do not want it to stop. I do not want to leave.

576
01:13:27,668 --> 01:13:29,545
All things come to an end.

577
01:13:31,463 --> 01:13:34,383
Sometimes you can do things against his will.

578
01:15:57,943 --> 01:15:59,778
Hi, darling. Is everything okay?

579
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:04,116
I have something to say.

580
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:06,451
What now?

581
01:16:08,245 --> 01:16:10,581
If you leave mom, you will regret it.

582
01:16:16,128 --> 01:16:19,631
Your mother and I took this decision together.

583
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:21,842
Liar. I know everything.

584
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:23,051
What?

585
01:16:23,177 --> 01:16:24,178
What she does not know.

586
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:26,847
- You know nothing at all.
You are!

587
01:16:27,848 --> 01:16:31,393
Okay, I'm listening.

588
01:16:32,269 --> 01:16:34,146
You have a mistress.

589
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:39,234
I saw his picture in your drawer. I followed you home.

590
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:42,029
I've seen them together several times.

591
01:16:42,488 --> 01:16:44,406
I can not believe you have done that.

592
01:16:44,907 --> 01:16:47,409
I went today, it was with another.

593
01:16:47,701 --> 01:16:50,954
It does not care about you. She does not love you!

594
01:16:51,622 --> 01:16:53,207
You can not leave for her mother.

595
01:16:53,415 --> 01:16:55,125
I let you do.

596
01:16:56,835 --> 01:16:59,588
They parted for another reason, not for Angela.

597
01:16:59,796 --> 01:17:00,839
Liar!

598
01:17:04,802 --> 01:17:06,053
I swear.

599
01:17:06,261 --> 01:17:07,763
- Listen, Filipa ...
- It's a bitch!

600
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:09,515
Listen ...

601
01:17:09,681 --> 01:17:11,600
Angela has anything to do with all that.

602
01:17:11,809 --> 01:17:13,602
You defend it from what I said?

603
01:17:13,811 --> 01:17:15,771
You're a child, you do not understand.

604
01:17:15,979 --> 01:17:18,315
Is false, and I will never understand.

605
01:17:42,381 --> 01:17:44,007
Okay, darling?

606
01:17:46,802 --> 01:17:49,263
You know why daddy leave you?

607
01:17:55,352 --> 01:17:56,770
He has a mistress.

608
01:17:57,646 --> 01:17:59,273
What are you talking about?

609
01:17:59,648 --> 01:18:01,400
True, I saw them.

610
01:18:19,418 --> 01:18:21,295
It has nothing to do.

611
01:18:24,173 --> 01:18:26,008
I do not know who he is or what happens

612
01:18:26,216 --> 01:18:27,676
but it has nothing to do.

613
01:18:32,598 --> 01:18:34,224
How?

614
01:18:39,438 --> 01:18:42,107
Your father had other connections.

615
01:18:42,608 --> 01:18:44,234
This is not the first time.

616
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,656
We did not come to the beach

617
01:18:49,907 --> 01:18:52,493
just so your father write his book.

618
01:18:54,328 --> 01:18:58,081
You should not know all that, you're a child.

619
01:18:58,290 --> 01:19:00,334
I am no longer a child.

620
01:19:07,841 --> 01:19:11,553
You remember the story of the book of your father?

621
01:19:11,804 --> 01:19:13,931
He spoke the other day at dinner.

622
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:15,182
I remember.

623
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:20,854
This woman is me, Filipa.

624
01:19:27,402 --> 01:19:29,112
I fell in love

625
01:19:29,321 --> 01:19:30,864
another man.

626
01:19:35,994 --> 01:19:38,956
He is ten years younger than me.

627
01:19:42,626 --> 01:19:44,044
One of my students ...

628
01:19:45,170 --> 01:19:47,422
who came to fetch me the other day.

629
01:19:52,427 --> 01:19:55,764
We tried to overcome it.

630
01:19:57,349 --> 01:19:59,143
But it did not work.

631
01:20:05,357 --> 01:20:07,109
Everything will be fine, dear.

632
01:20:07,985 --> 01:20:09,486
Do not cry.

633
01:20:11,113 --> 01:20:12,573
Everything will be fine.

634
01:20:13,448 --> 01:20:15,909
You're just lying to you.

635
01:20:17,703 --> 01:20:19,288
You're just lying.

636
01:22:22,286 --> 01:22:23,287
Fine. Goodbye

637
01:22:24,705 --> 01:22:25,706
Serve me a whiskey.

638
01:22:27,791 --> 01:22:29,251
The bar has closed.

639
01:22:30,043 --> 01:22:31,420
Go, a whiskey.

640
01:22:33,046 --> 01:22:34,590
You're the same age?

641
01:22:35,466 --> 01:22:37,384
I have the age for many things.

642
01:22:39,303 --> 01:22:41,597
Yes, but I can not sell you.

643
01:22:41,805 --> 01:22:43,015
Of course it does.

644
01:22:43,599 --> 01:22:44,892
No.

645
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:46,935
Please.

646
01:22:48,061 --> 01:22:49,104
Go.

647
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:54,151
Nobody knows?

648
01:22:55,068 --> 01:22:56,737
Nobody will know.

649
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:58,071
Nobody?

650
01:23:01,366 --> 01:23:02,493
All right.

651
01:23:25,641 --> 01:23:26,642
You like?

652
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:27,935
Yes.

653
01:23:48,664 --> 01:23:50,374
Filipa is not with you?

654
01:23:50,666 --> 01:23:52,084
She is not here?

655
01:23:53,043 --> 01:23:54,086
No.

656
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:59,383
We had a difficult conversation.

657
01:24:02,427 --> 01:24:04,847
She told me that you had an affair.

658
01:24:06,723 --> 01:24:08,976
I told him things.

659
01:24:10,102 --> 01:24:12,187
What did you say?

660
01:24:12,855 --> 01:24:13,981
Almost everything.

661
01:24:16,525 --> 01:24:18,318
These bags, what is it?

662
01:24:20,154 --> 01:24:21,822
You gonna join?

663
01:24:23,365 --> 01:24:24,908
No, Mathias.

664
01:24:25,409 --> 01:24:27,202
I will live with him.

665
01:24:27,828 --> 01:24:29,329
You're kidding.

666
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:34,459
You'll take my children to live with your lover?

667
01:24:35,210 --> 01:24:38,255
- You think I'll let you do?
- You do not understand.

668
01:24:39,381 --> 01:24:41,133
I go alone.

669
01:24:41,842 --> 01:24:43,886
The children stay with you.

670
01:24:45,471 --> 01:24:46,472
This is ridiculous!

671
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,557
Going live with this kid?

672
01:24:48,765 --> 01:24:50,225
Let me go!

673
01:24:50,434 --> 01:24:51,518
You're a mother!

674
01:24:53,812 --> 01:24:56,398
You abandon your children!

675
01:25:02,488 --> 01:25:04,114
It's you I give up.

676
01:25:18,712 --> 01:25:19,713
Please.

677
01:25:20,172 --> 01:25:21,131
Let.

678
01:25:21,298 --> 01:25:22,716
Let me go, Mathias.

679
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:24,802
Please.

680
01:25:25,219 --> 01:25:27,679
I'm exhausted.

681
01:25:28,388 --> 01:25:29,932
This is not me.

682
01:25:30,140 --> 01:25:31,892
I am not a drunk.

683
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:34,311
I'll change. Rest.

684
01:25:34,478 --> 01:25:37,272
Let me go. Take care of children.

685
01:25:38,065 --> 01:25:39,399
Take care of them.

686
01:29:59,284 --> 01:30:01,119
