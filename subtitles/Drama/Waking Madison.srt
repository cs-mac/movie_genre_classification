No, I don't remember anything.

And how do you know that you were
in New York for two months?

404

a bus ticket in my bag

that said it was
from New Orleans to New York.

I was, uh, 13,

these crowns of thorns.

that was really special to her.

And... and so I put that one
on my head.

434

And I cut my wrists and my ankles,
and I laid down on the floor

so that I was beautiful and peaceful,
just like Jesus.

And, um... and I thought
when she found me,

437
00:34:57,863 --> 00:35:00,457
she'd be really happy,
because she loves Him so much.

that she'd never...

as much as she loves Jesus.

It's okay.

823
00:59:30,234 --> 00:59:32,759

- I don't...

DOLLY: "What is real?",
asked the rabbit.

826
00:59:39,877 --> 00:59:42,539
"Real isn't how you're made,"
said the skin horse.

827
00:59:42,713 --> 00:59:46,240
"It's a thing that happens to you."

828
00:59:46,350 --> 00:59:49,148
- My turn?
- Go ahead.

829
00:59:49,253 --> 00:59:50,242
"Does it hurt?"

830
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:52,151
"Sometimes.

831
00:59:52,256 --> 00:59:56,124
When you are real,
you don't mind being hurt."

832
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:57,853
"Does it happen all at once?"

833
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,191
"It doesn't happen all at once.

834
01:00:00,297 --> 01:00:04,063
You become.
It takes a long time.

835
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:07,331
That's why it doesn't often happen
to people who break easily,

836
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,531
or who have sharp edges,

837
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:12,473
or who have to be carefully kept.

838
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:14,669
Generally...

839
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,704
By the time you are real,

840
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:20,079
most of your hair
has been loved off,

841
01:00:20,184 --> 01:00:22,118
and your eyes drop out,

842
01:00:22,219 --> 01:00:26,019
and you get loose in the joints
and very shabby.

843
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:28,751
But these things don't matter at all,

844
01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:31,828
because once you are real,
you can't be ugly,

845
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:35,365
except to people
who don't understand."

- Yes, Maddie?

850
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:18,039

851
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:20,268
Hey, Madison.

852
01:01:20,377 --> 01:01:22,538
Madison?

853
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:24,341
Madison, what's wrong?

854
01:01:24,448 --> 01:01:25,813
What do you want, Alexis?

855
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,349
You want to come play with me?

856
01:01:27,451 --> 01:01:28,475
Nope.

857
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:30,610
Why? What's wrong?

858
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,383
Nothing's wrong.

859
01:01:33,557 --> 01:01:36,617
You always say nothing's wrong
when something is always wrong.

860
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:38,385
Why don't you come play with me?
Come on.

861
01:01:38,495 --> 01:01:39,359
Just one game.

862
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:40,953
- Do you see those people right there?
- Yeah.

863
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:43,432
They look like
they're having a lot of fun.

864
01:01:43,534 --> 01:01:44,626
I think you should go play with them.

865
01:01:44,801 --> 01:01:46,393
No, I want to play with you.

866
01:01:46,503 --> 01:01:47,231
Checkmate!

867
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:49,862
Okay, okay.
Well, um, uh, we can play...

868
01:01:49,973 --> 01:01:50,940
Yeah?

869
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,133
- Hide and go seek.
- Okay.

870
01:01:52,242 --> 01:01:53,402
All right, so you're gonna go hide.

871
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:56,104
No, we did that the other day,
and you didn't come and find me.

872
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,771
Madison, you didn't come.

873
01:01:57,881 --> 01:01:59,872
I've got a better idea.
Why don't we go play horses?

874
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:03,316
Come on. We can ride horses,
like we always used to ride horses.

875
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,479
- We can ride horses.
- No, there's no horses here.

876
01:02:05,589 --> 01:02:07,420
What are you talking about?
We used to always ride horses.

877
01:02:07,524 --> 01:02:08,991
Yeah, well, we're
in a hospital right now,

878
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:11,424
and I've never been on a horse
in my entire life.

879

881
01:02:14,765 --> 01:02:16,323

- Why are you being so weird?

882

Well, I was sitting
in the front in his station wagon,

917
01:04:25,462 --> 01:04:30,798
and he had, like, um,
these red plastic seat covers.
