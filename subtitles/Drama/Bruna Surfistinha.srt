2
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:44,928
Raquel, sensually yours.

3
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,296
<i>I'm not telling
this story to apologize</i>

4
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:16,231
<i>or to explain the reason I left.</i>

5
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:20,125
<i>Especially because the only
people I wanted forgiveness from...</i>

6
00:04:20,126 --> 00:04:21,901
<i>I left behind that night.</i>

7
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:24,863
<i>When my parents
woke up the next day,</i>

8
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:25,968
<i>I wasn't there any more.</i>

9
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,820
Come in.

10
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:06,938
Sit down, kiddo.

11
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:17,620
What's up?

12
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,787
I called yesterday.

13
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:23,523
Raquel.

14
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,395
Oh, what a surprise!
You came to see the place?

15
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,258
Yeah, I figured I could stay,

16
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,632
lulu.

17
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,298
See how things work.

18
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,509
Let me look at you

19
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,085
Any experience?

20
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,224
Sit here, kiddo.

21
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,113
You're a pretty thing, huh...

22
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:27,055
It's all right, sweetie,
I'll let you stay.

23
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,393
We'll see how the month goes,

24
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,862
and then we'll get
your paperwork in order

25
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,097
Are you going to
sign work papers?

26
00:07:37,156 --> 00:07:39,534
Sure, so you can
receive your benefits,

27
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:42,766
pension, Christmas bonus,
retirement fund...

28
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,337
Just kidding', silly.

29
00:07:49,435 --> 00:07:53,815
The deal is simple: each
trick lasts one hour for R$100.

30
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,717
40 is yours and
60 goes to the house

31
00:07:56,943 --> 00:08:03,121
If you change your sheets
too much, you'll pay for laundry.

32
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,529
- OK?
- OK.

33
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,033
Let's go meet the girls.

34
00:08:10,122 --> 00:08:13,296
Did you choose that name, Raquel?

35
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,804
It's kind of lame, get another.

36
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,607
Let's go, sweetie.

37
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:25,170
Look at this woman's fake boobs
They don't even move.

38
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,741
- Let me see.
- Ila

39
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,377
Look at that!

40
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,888
<i>We work the whole day.</i>

41
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:35,819
We're open from 10 am to 10 pm. -mun

42
00:08:35,882 --> 00:08:38,055
Rush hour is during the day.

43
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:43,391
Girls, she's going to replace Joyce.

44
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,826
Here you can wash your clothes,

45
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:51,104
get dressed, wait for a client...

46
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:54,840
The lockers are over
there, one for each girl.

47
00:08:55,167 --> 00:08:57,078
Not much space,
but it's enough.

48
00:08:58,437 --> 00:08:59,643
Thanks, honey.

49
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,381
You should all go to sleep,
tomorrow is the 10th,

50
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,820
our busiest day.

51
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,323
<i>It always scared me spending
the night away from my home.</i>

52
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,727
<i>I'd want to leave in
the middle of the night.</i>

53
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,991
<i>Suddenly, I was somewhere
I didn't know very well,</i>

54
00:09:52,992 --> 00:09:55,097
<i>sharing a room
with three call girls...</i>

55
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,936
<i>that I'd never seen before.</i>

56
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,018
Which class do you have today?

57
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,355
Several, mom.
It's not just one.

58
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,852
Hey folks!

59
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:20,689
Good morning, son.

60
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,194
Let's go to the game on Sunday?

61
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:29,236
Yeah, sure.

62
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,267
Be careful, you're going to
get your clothes dirty.

63
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:39,374
Don't worry, mom,
she's already kind of dirty

64
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,479
Rodrigo!

65
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,506
Writing is a way of saying
what can't be said.

66
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,000
Revealing what we don't
like about ourselves.

67
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,880
Giving this to the reader
as an ugly gift,

68
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:15,180
that we give away
expecting nothing in return

69
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:18,747
Hey, class.

70
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:23,590
Gabriela and Lucian
are up next week.

71
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,537
Hey, did you get my text?

72
00:11:46,338 --> 00:11:47,043
Yeah.

73
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,075
So, let's study at
my place today?

74
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:54,850
I don't know. I won't
be able to stay long.

75
00:11:54,914 --> 00:11:56,018
It won't take long.

76
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,325
It'll be quick.

77
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:16,672
Hi.

78
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,770
Hi, I managed to show up.

79
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:21,274
I'm glad you're here
Let's go inside.

80
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:29,322
My room, Raquel. Raquel, my room.
Make yourself comfortable.

81
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,417
Should we study
the whole book or...

82
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,762
only the last two chapters?

83
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:36,756
I forgot my book at school.

84
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:38,998
No problem, we can
study with mine.

85
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:39,930
NI-m.

86
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,133
I want to kiss you.

87
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,632
We better study.
I can't stay for long.

88
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,010
I should be home.

89
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:49,842
Just a little kiss.

90
00:12:52,371 --> 00:12:53,076
Come here.

91
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:17,867
Come here.

92
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,234
Go.

93
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:21,569
- Do something for me.
- WI.

94
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,879
Come on.

95
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,192
Come on.

96
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:52,674
Hm.
This is what you came for.

97
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,046
Enough! Get off!

98
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:02,615
You can't stop now.
You gonna leave me hanging?

99
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,077
Jerk!

100
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,316
Why don't you do
what you did to Felipe?

101
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,054
Blow me till I'm done.

102
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,454
You fucking nerd.

103
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:31,148
Honey, did you decide
on your school trip?

104
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,610
It's this weekend.

105
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:36,682
Have you talked to your father?

106
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:40,924
Everyone's going.
I still need to pay.

107
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:43,392
Let's change
the subject, Celeste?

108
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,854
- - As usual...

109
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:51,961
Have you thought about
studying, going to college?

110
00:14:52,024 --> 00:14:54,095
Trying to become someone.

111
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,466
And now you're complaining,

112
00:14:55,527 --> 00:14:57,428
"I'm not going on the school trip..."

113
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:59,375
- Rodrigo, please.
- Mom, I have to...

114
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:04,070
Let's change
the subject, Celeste

115
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:20,826
HI, RAQUEL, CHECK MY PROFILE,
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.

116
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:28,259
Yesterday, I HAD A GREAT TIME
STUDYING!

117
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,400
IF YOU WANT A STUDY PARTNER,
I RECOMMEND HER! LO

118
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,076
Asshole, son of a bitch.

119
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:38,805
- Raquel, have you...
- Can't you knock?

120
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:43,414
Have you seen the jewelry
your father gave me?

121
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,548
The ones from the wedding?

122
00:15:45,978 --> 00:15:47,355
Yes, from our anniversary.

123
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,151
It must be in the closet.
That's where you keep them.

124
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:54,592
Raquel, are you sure
you don't know where it is?

125
00:15:59,892 --> 00:16:00,529
No.

126
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,467
RAQUEL'S A COCKSUCKER

127
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,620
Ms. Larissa! Client!

128
00:17:31,683 --> 00:17:33,560
No need to yell,
I see who comes in.

129
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,360
Remember, sweetie, my monitor?

130
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,429
Look who's still alive.

131
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,766
It's been a while.

132
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,335
Honey, get up there.

133
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:48,369
Now look what
a coincidence, Hudson

134
00:17:48,434 --> 00:17:51,972
A pretty little thing just arrived,

135
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:54,117
that you'll really like.

136
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:59,387
Tell us, how did you
end up in this joint?

137
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,483
'Cause you sure don't
look like a call girl.

138
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:04,658
If you tell me you're a virgin.
I'll believe you.

139
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,591
Ms. Larissa said
she is coming up.

140
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:13,898
Client or complaint?

141
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:18,806
It's that nice guy that
hasn't shown up in a while.

142
00:18:22,367 --> 00:18:23,710
Girls.

143
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,844
These stairs kill me.

144
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,088
You, client.

145
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,062
Hurry up, honey.
I don't have all day.

146
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:53,340
Girls, fix yourselves up,
you're looking worn out.

147
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:56,203
Come, sweetie, get down there.

148
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:42,883
Hi.

149
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,186
Hi.

150
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,556
I'm Hudson.

151
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,404
Hi, Hudson.

152
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:56,799
What's your name?

153
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:06,412
Brunei.

154
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:08,910
What?

155
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:11,881
Brunei.

156
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:23,357
How old are you, Brunei?

157
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:27,303
I'm 18.

158
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,021
It's your first trick, isn't it?

159
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,356
It is, here.

160
00:21:02,628 --> 00:21:05,541
Calm down. Relax.

161
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,339
Come here, sit down.

162
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,992
Stand up.

163
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:37,897
Lay down

164
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,207
<i>I didn't cry.</i>

165
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:54,917
<i>I didn't ask to stop.</i>

166
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,316
<i>I didn't run back
to my parents' house.</i>

167
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,121
<i>At that moment, Raquel,</i>

168
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,519
<i>the Raquel I once was,</i>

169
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,687
<i>was dead.</i>

170
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,867
Can I leave this here to wash?

171
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,043
Leave it with the others.

172
00:23:31,843 --> 00:23:33,948
Oh, My God!

173
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:39,022
Barbie, when you open
the tap, the shower goes cold.

174
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:42,089
Go wash your
undies somewhere else

175
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:04,448
Hurry up in there, Janine.

176
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:11,855
Want a fix, cutie?

177
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,447
Let's get dressed,
we got clients.

178
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,227
<i>Just like any other job,</i>

179
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:50,391
<i>the secret was knowing
how to sell yourself.</i>

180
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:54,301
I'm Mel, I suck real good.

181
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:55,701
Hi, Mel.

182
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:58,496
I'm Janine, how you doing?

183
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,908
Better now.

184
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,508
Hi, I'm Brunei and I'll do
whatever you want.

185
00:25:05,537 --> 00:25:08,780
<i>At first, I didn't know
how to be sexy,</i>

186
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,547
<i>how to be desired.</i>

187
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,182
<i>I never imagined someone
would pay to be with me.</i>

188
00:25:16,448 --> 00:25:19,361
<i>On the first week,
I had about 30 guys.</i>

189
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:23,232
<i>That's more than most
women fuck in their entire lives.</i>

190
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:37,071
<i>Earn 5000 Raise a month
giving massage.</i>

191
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,311
<i>This is what the ad said.</i>

192
00:25:39,671 --> 00:25:42,049
<i>It sounded like the
easiest job in the world,</i>

193
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:43,752
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

194
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,309
<i>But what I made
working there...</i>

195
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:49,053
<i>was more than double
my brother's income.</i>

196
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:51,355
<i>It was more than those
preppy school girls...</i>

197
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,362
<i>would earn with a diploma.</i>

198
00:25:53,418 --> 00:25:57,730
Girls, introductions in room 3
Mel and Janine, go.

199
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,830
Brunei, you can rest
Come on, girls.

200
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:05,136
Larissa, if you want
I can go again.

201
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,478
If I keep this up,
how much can I earn a month?

202
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:24,653
Sweetie, a lot more than a
saleswoman behind the counter.

203
00:26:26,017 --> 00:26:29,396
Now, please buy
some sexier outfits.

204
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,901
Those rags you wear

205
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,123
I like this one.

206
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,795
Those are granny panties.

207
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:05,664
There are some
great blouses over here

208
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:13,438
Let me see.

209
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,602
It looks great.

210
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:21,447
I don't know...

211
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,798
We beat you 3 nil, bro.

212
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:47,941
That's Brunei.

213
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:04,214
Fuck, man, she's hot.

214
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,216
For real!

215
00:28:06,918 --> 00:28:10,456
"I"

216
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,532
No, we can chat upstairs.

217
00:28:12,824 --> 00:28:15,668
I can call the other
girls for your friend.

218
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:18,606
No, I want you

219
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,142
Let's go upstairs?

220
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:21,769
OK.

221
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,913
- Wait here.
- What else can I do?

222
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,915
<i>The girls said that in the beginning
every newcomer did well.</i>

223
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,113
<i>But while they talked about me,</i>

224
00:28:33,178 --> 00:28:34,680
<i>I was making a name for myself.</i>

225
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:36,356
<i>I have to confess,</i>

226
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:40,021
<i>I loved being the
most popular girl in school.</i>

227
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:46,567
Oh, .fuck.
Yum.

228
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,833
That feels good.

229
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:32,907
Hi.

230
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:33,807
Hi.

231
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:35,149
I'm Brunei

232
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:36,916
Gustavo.

233
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:40,189
"- Let's go upstairs?- pl

234
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,300
- Come in.
- Excuse me.

235
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:22,682
Please come back.

236
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:24,685
I will.

237
00:32:27,712 --> 00:32:28,622
I will.

238
00:32:39,891 --> 00:32:42,201
When you go downstairs to pay,

239
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:46,739
tell them this one is on me.

240
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,346
- Lily'?
- This one is the house.

241
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:09,895
I'm fed up with this shit.

242
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,526
Barbie is hogging all the clients.

243
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,104
Let the girl earn her money

244
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,261
Are you jealous?

245
00:33:18,262 --> 00:33:20,139
I'm not jealous!

246
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:22,302
I have a son to raise.

247
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:27,774
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

248
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:32,143
There's something
we don't know about her.

249
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:33,678
There sure is.

250
00:33:40,251 --> 00:33:43,027
Hi, I'm Brunei.

251
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:44,560
I'm Rodrigo.

252
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:49,700
Remember?

253
00:33:50,995 --> 00:33:53,271
Remember me, Brunei?

254
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,905
I'm Celeste and Mr. Otto's son,

255
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,116
that great naive couple,

256
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:06,318
who adopted that ugly little girl,

257
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:11,289
believing she could be someone.
And look at what she turned into,

258
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,425
a whore.

259
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:20,725
- You are a whore.
- What are you doing here?

260
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,430
I should ask you.
What are you doing here?

261
00:34:26,364 --> 00:34:27,775
What are you doing here?

262
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,103
You whore.

263
00:34:32,437 --> 00:34:36,078
My mother loves you.
Their life turned into a living hell

264
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:38,815
They keep blaming
each other and here you are

265
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:46,055
spreading your legs
for a hundred raise!

266
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:52,995
I'm going to scream!...

267
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,071
Is it money you want?

268
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,478
Take it!

269
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:08,082
Now stay away from my family.

270
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,747
I'll tear you apart,
so help me God.

271
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,853
Slut. You piece of shit.

272
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:19,050
Stay away.

273
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,227
Alright?

274
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:26,667
Brunei...

275
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:32,838
Whore.

276
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:11,809
<i>I don't know why,
but for some reason,</i>

277
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,009
<i>I thought! was doing that
because I loved my parents.</i>

278
00:36:15,573 --> 00:36:17,575
<i>It was never something
I did to hurt them,</i>

279
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,780
<i>I just wanted them to
feel something for me.</i>

280
00:36:22,146 --> 00:36:24,820
<i>Longing, shame,</i>

281
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,291
<i>Of even anger.</i>

282
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:56,653
Hello?

283
00:36:58,416 --> 00:36:59,053
Hello?

284
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,626
<i>Hello?</i>

285
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,096
Raquel!

286
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:09,598
<i>Is that you, Raquel?</i>

287
00:37:11,495 --> 00:37:12,303
<i>Raquel?</i>

288
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,206
Hi.

289
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,317
You are not well today.

290
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,317
What's the matter?

291
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,487
Everything's OK, Hudson

292
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:42,720
Hudson.

293
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:45,757
Hudson.

294
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,135
I'm a working girl.

295
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:55,200
If things are fine
with you, then I feel great

296
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,240
No, I don't want
to have sex today.

297
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,543
Today I want you to smoke.

298
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,623
Go over by the window.
I want to look at you.

299
00:39:31,569 --> 00:39:32,547
Don't look at me.

300
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,549
Can I tell you a secret?

301
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,794
Is it what I'm thinking?

302
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,892
You were my very first client.

303
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,673
Is that what you were thinking?

304
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:40,104
No. I thought you were
going to tell me your name.

305
00:40:41,972 --> 00:40:43,474
You know my name

306
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,684
It's Brunei.

307
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,190
Tell me your name, come on

308
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,422
My name is Brunei.

309
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:57,031
Pour me some coffee, hon.

310
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,903
The next client is all yours.

311
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,731
It's time for
you to haul a man.

312
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,206
Let's go to my office,

313
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,218
you'll put on some perfume
and go to the reception.

314
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,384
Let's go. -
Grab my cigarettes.

315
00:41:24,381 --> 00:41:27,123
What about the diary?
Have you been writing?

316
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,090
Yeah.

317
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:31,525
Want a cigarette?

318
00:41:31,755 --> 00:41:32,699
No, thanks.

319
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:46,573
Fuck! I can't believe it!

320
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:49,743
Someone stole my stuff!
Who was it?!

321
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:50,683
Are you nuts?

322
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:54,612
- It was you, wasn't it?
- What are you talking about?

323
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:59,127
- Maybe you misplaced it?
- Someone broke into my locker.

324
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:01,327
They took
my jewelry, my money- W

325
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,830
Maybe you deserve it...

326
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,730
What do you mean,
you jealous bitch?

327
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,564
Everyone knows
who you really are.

328
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:08,933
I don't steal from anybody.

329
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,829
I'm gonna kick your ass

330
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:13,963
I'm not stupid.

331
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:16,399
- What's going on?
- Brunei’s locker was broken into.

332
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,006
Everything I had was stolen.

333
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,709
- I'm going to call the cops
- Are you insane?

334
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,675
What's going on?

335
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:26,813
I.-1" SHI’ITE-I.

336
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:28,249
Larissa, look at me.

337
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,785
I swear on my son.
I didn't steal anything.

338
00:42:36,854 --> 00:42:39,355
She says she didn't
take it. Enough.

339
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,597
The show's over. Scatter.

340
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,434
- - Who does she think she is?
- Be quiet.

341
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:49,573
What do you want me
to do? Let it slide?

342
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,368
I told you, Janine
has a short fuse.

343
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,043
She'll do anything for
a client, but she's not a thief.

344
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,813
Who else would want
to screw me?

345
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,330
Don't run away,
I'm talking to you.

346
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,090
'Wig?

347
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,491
Where's my money?

348
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:18,061
What money?
I didn't take anything.

349
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:19,234
Are you insane?

350
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,876
You're fucked if
you don't tell me.

351
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,477
Say it! Say it!

352
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,035
I didn't take anything.

353
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,982
I'll have to hurt you.

354
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,717
Where is my money?

355
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,284
Say it. bitch!
I don't want to hurt you.

356
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:40,424
I'm not a preppy
idiot. Tell me.

357
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,996
I'm sorry

358
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:58,537
I spent it all on coke.

359
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:04,716
I'm pathetic. Sorry.

360
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:16,958
You'll pay me back.

361
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,822
I'm not an idiot.
You will pay me.

362
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:20,767
You hear me?

363
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,501
Fucking junkie!

364
00:44:37,641 --> 00:44:39,484
Piss off, you wanna-be slut.

365
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,888
What are you writing?

366
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:44,857
A letter to my son

367
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:48,755
What do you want with me?

368
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:51,790
I want to apologize.

369
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:53,534
I'm sorry for accusing you.

370
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:56,462
I know it wasn't you.

371
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:57,967
Listen up,

372
00:44:58,896 --> 00:45:01,998
I've starved,
couldn't send money home,

373
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:04,343
but I've never stolen anything.

374
00:45:05,636 --> 00:45:07,240
I'm apologizing.

375
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:12,579
You girls think I'm a stupid
prom queen on vacation.

376
00:45:13,644 --> 00:45:16,352
But for me it's hard
as hell to be here too.

377
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,555
I respect all of you.

378
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,797
I want to be respected as well.

379
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,724
Alright.

380
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:42,243
<i>People think call girls
work at night,</i>

381
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:45,786
<i>But the truth is we're
busier during the day.</i>

382
00:45:46,543 --> 00:45:47,920
<i>I never stopped.</i>

383
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,288
<i>When I closed the door, I didn't
want to be just another fuck.</i>

384
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,091
<i>I wanted to be the
highlight of that guy's day.</i>

385
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:57,891
<i>I didn't discriminate.</i>

386
00:45:58,288 --> 00:45:59,858
<i>Call girls don't choose.</i>

387
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,994
<i>I treated everyone well,</i>

388
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:03,695
<i>I guess that was my secret.</i>

389
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:06,874
<i>Sometimes, knowing that
a client wanted me,</i>

390
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,807
<i>was worth more than the money.</i>

391
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:14,846
<i>It was weird thinking
that while they were there,</i>

392
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:18,045
<i>their wives were at work
or cooking at home.</i>

393
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,514
<i>But even this became
a subject in bed.</i>

394
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:25,359
<i>Each of them was a trip,
another story for me to tell.</i>

395
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:30,163
<i>There was a guy who liked
to show me how big he was.</i>

396
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:32,458
Biggest one you
ever seen, right?

397
00:46:34,424 --> 00:46:37,462
<i>Another one paid to
move furniture around.</i>

398
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,037
Now... the bed goes over there!

399
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,544
<i>It was all he could do, poor guy.</i>

400
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:48,604
- Is it good over here?
- I want to look out that way

401
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:51,415
Put the stool on that side.

402
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,387
It will look great!

403
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:58,792
<i>But the funniest
client, was Mr. Powder.</i>

404
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:00,923
<i>Go on up, dear.</i>

405
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,825
<i>He almost poisoned us
with all that baby powder.</i>

406
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:10,636
Hey, Janine, Powder digs you.

407
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:14,569
<i>There were many strange guys,</i>

408
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,569
<i>but for some reason,
I pleased them all.</i>

409
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:21,481
<i>Seven out often guys
wanted Brunei.</i>

410
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:29,620
Brunei,

411
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:36,060
now that you're experienced,
tell us, what do men like?

412
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,458
Every man likes something different.

413
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,933
Men like to make women cum.

414
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:45,629
If you moan just right,
even if you fake it, they go crazy

415
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,710
If the guy realizes you're
doing it for money,

416
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:49,903
he's not coming back.

417
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,140
- Right, Janine?
- Moan for us.

418
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,037
Moan so that we
can hear Barbie moaning

419
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:58,042
Let's find out how
you get so many clients

420
00:47:58,108 --> 00:48:00,418
Moan! I want to see
if you're a professional.

421
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,453
- Moan, goddammit.
- Moan, come on. It's easy

422
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,587
Sometimes you take in
a breath, like this...

423
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,469
Stop it.

424
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:25,841
Moan, girl!

425
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:30,379
Could you tone it down a bit,
the customers are complaining.

426
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:33,284
The customers?
And what are we?

427
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:38,149
I'm asking with all due
respect for you to keep it down

428
00:48:38,215 --> 00:48:39,888
I'm not keeping it down.

429
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,931
I'm a customer and
I'll talk the way I want.

430
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:45,464
I think you're losing
your temper for nothing.

431
00:48:45,522 --> 00:48:47,690
Be honest, you don't
serve prostitutes here.

432
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,926
Madam, if you keep
screaming I'll call security.

433
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:58,008
Take your hands off me.
Let's go, girls, we're leaving.

434
00:48:58,669 --> 00:48:59,909
You got a problem?

435
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,372
- How much do I owe you?
- You don't have to pay.

436
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:06,843
I'm going to pay.
Listen up, ladies,

437
00:49:07,244 --> 00:49:09,246
while you complain
about other people's lives,

438
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:12,223
we have an appointment
with your husbands.

439
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:16,287
If you want to learn something,
here's my business card.

440
00:49:19,756 --> 00:49:23,397
This is bullshit.
Go fuck yourselves.

441
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:26,202
What was that?

442
00:49:27,431 --> 00:49:29,604
Screw your customers!

443
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,271
Leave it over there.

444
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:34,670
My nails look terrible.

445
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,207
Why did you pay?

446
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:40,215
Why did you waste
all that money?

447
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:09,076
Shit.

448
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,705
It didn't smear that much.

449
00:51:16,673 --> 00:51:19,017
I was watching you
on the dance floor...

450
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:20,419
You rocked, girl.

451
00:51:23,146 --> 00:51:24,284
What's your name?

452
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:26,689
Brunei.

453
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:30,125
Pleasure. I'm Carol.

454
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:39,673
I'm with friends in the VIP area
that would love to meet you.

455
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:41,999
VIP area?

456
00:51:46,803 --> 00:51:49,943
Guys, this is Brunei.

457
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,376
Nice to meet you, Brunei.

458
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:56,687
How are you?

459
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:09,667
Never seen you here
before, Brunei. First time?

460
00:52:12,429 --> 00:52:13,840
What do you work with, Brunei?

461
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:15,840
Sex.

462
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:26,378
I want to talk with my friend.

463
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,713
We're waiting for
you outside. Let's go?

464
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:33,584
Hey, Brunei

465
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,355
Give me a call,
I'd love to see you again.

466
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,462
Here's something for
you to remember me by.

467
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,327
We're leaving.

468
00:52:44,394 --> 00:52:47,534
<i>Bye. You better go
cause she's stressed out.</i>

469
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,532
Oh, fuck. Turn it off.

470
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:24,771
Shit, the cops.

471
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,805
My registration's expired,
everything is fucked.

472
00:53:31,474 --> 00:53:33,147
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

473
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,553
License, please.

474
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:36,649
Just a second.

475
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:44,653
Damn it. I left it at home.
Everything is in my other purse.

476
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,156
At least give me the
vehicle's registration.

477
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,768
I left it all there, man.

478
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:50,466
I'll have to seize your
vehicle and your license.

479
00:53:50,627 --> 00:53:53,437
Let it slide, man.
There are only women here.

480
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,474
"Let it slide?"

481
00:53:55,498 --> 00:54:00,072
Officer, can I have
a quick word with you?

482
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,816
A quick word?

483
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:08,385
What's she going to do?

484
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,126
I can't believe it.

485
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,197
Look!

486
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:29,276
I'm shocked.

487
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:41,850
He fell for it.

488
00:54:59,829 --> 00:55:01,900
Barbie scored the cop.

489
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,952
Our princess had a quickie.

490
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,585
We're good to go.

491
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:20,352
<i>Me and my girlfriend,
Were holding each other tight,</i>

492
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:23,796
<i>She turns to me and says,
Would some wine be alright?</i>

493
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:27,892
<i>Next thing I know,
She has lost her mind,</i>

494
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,293
<i>Now everyone is looking'
At my princess' behind!</i>

495
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:35,197
<i>She's a goner, dancing' crazy,
Morin' across the? oor,</i>

496
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:38,667
<i>I'm standing' here like a fool,
Trying' hard to ignore,</i>

497
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:42,338
<i>But she keeps getting' down and dirty,
Shaking' it from bottom to top,</i>

498
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:46,008
<i>She goes up, she gets down,
My princess just can't stop!</i>

499
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,488
<i>She goes up, she gets down...</i>

500
00:55:50,447 --> 00:55:53,758
Oh, God... My head

501
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,588
Jesus, major hangover...

502
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:00,768
I think I'm still drunk.

503
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,405
What's gotten into you?
Are you deaf?

504
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,175
I'm ringing the damn bell
and no one showed up.

505
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,278
And what about this dirty table?

506
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,019
Kelly!

507
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,621
Got wasted last night, huh?

508
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:35,434
Whoever not ready in
five minutes is getting fined.

509
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:42,474
What about sleeping beauty?
Where is she?

510
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:45,969
Jesus Christ.

511
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,881
There are no clean sheets.

512
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:01,728
There's nothing I can do.
The laundry isn't back yet.

513
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,392
You expect me to
work on cum-stained sheets?

514
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,595
Turn them over.

515
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:14,633
You've slept more than worked,
so they can't be that stained.

516
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:15,675
Alright then.

517
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:19,243
When the next client arrives,
I'll fuck him on the floor.

518
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:24,016
You're starting to
piss me off, you little bitch

519
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,287
Punk.

520
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,285
How much longer, Carol?

521
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:39,087
At least another 45 minutes.

522
00:57:39,088 --> 00:57:41,159
- 46!?
- Dmlnnl

523
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:48,800
I have to be careful
not to get ugly again.

524
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:51,572
Don't get paranoid, sugar.
You look great.

525
00:57:52,001 --> 00:57:55,210
By the way, Miguel called me.
He spoke highly of you.

526
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:59,512
I'm going to introduce
you to some high rollers.

527
00:57:59,576 --> 00:58:02,079
Just like your sugar daddy,
with an allowance every month?

528
00:58:02,912 --> 00:58:06,792
Soon you'll score a man who'll
pay for your vacation, benefits...

529
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:09,723
III

530
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:10,821
Don't even say it.

531
00:58:11,254 --> 00:58:15,031
I ran away so that I
wouldn't depend on anyone

532
00:58:19,796 --> 00:58:22,504
Now, honestly,
that friend of yours Gabi...

533
00:58:22,966 --> 00:58:26,539
just won't do. She's cheap
She's too ghetto.

534
00:58:26,603 --> 00:58:28,344
You're at another level.

535
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:50,935
- I'm playing for keeps.
- You're picking up all my cards

536
00:58:50,994 --> 00:58:54,168
I'm playing for real.
I want to win this cash.

537
00:59:05,942 --> 00:59:09,253
Listen up, girls.
I want everyone's attention.

538
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:19,024
If you want to fuck up
your nose snorting, go ahead

539
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,961
But not in my place.

540
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,228
I want to know whose this is.

541
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,009
Who owns this crap?

542
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:32,408
There's a bunch of girls
out there looking for work.

543
00:59:34,070 --> 00:59:38,519
Plenty of hot,
beautiful college-girls!

544
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:40,654
Spill it, Kelly.

545
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:45,517
If you don't, you'll be the
first one out on the street.

546
00:59:46,883 --> 00:59:50,592
Leave her out of this.
I admit it. It's all mine.

547
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:52,992
I don't care.

548
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:01,240
It's all mine, Larissa.

549
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:06,113
News flash.

550
01:00:12,575 --> 01:00:14,987
Both of you, pack
your things and get out.

551
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:16,988
Do you hear me?

552
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:23,158
<i>Now! 1, 2, 3, out!</i>

553
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,669
Fucking bitch.

554
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:50,646
For what the building offers,
the price is excellent.

555
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,491
- Yes, it really is.
- It's pricey, though.

556
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:58,430
Services like parking and
rec area are included.

557
01:00:59,188 --> 01:00:59,893
Everything's included

558
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,960
I don't think
we need a place this big.

559
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:07,240
A flat like this doesn't cost as
much as a hellhole in the ghetto.

560
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:11,170
These stairs lead to the suite.
Lavatory, kitchen, terrace.

561
01:01:15,204 --> 01:01:18,117
<i>Carol was my ticket to
the world of VIP clients.</i>

562
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:20,879
<i>Gobi, my partner, was with me.</i>

563
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,290
<i>They were my only friends,</i>

564
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:28,592
<i>but back then I was more
concerned with money than friendship.</i>

565
01:01:33,623 --> 01:01:36,399
I'm afraid we're
risking too much.

566
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:41,168
Gobi, some call girls earn more
than doctors or lawyers.

567
01:01:41,564 --> 01:01:43,699
If all else fails, the worst
that can happen to you

568
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:46,806
is going back
to turning tricks.

569
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:50,184
You now that
I'm looking for another gig.

570
01:01:50,606 --> 01:01:53,416
I wanna work in fashion
and never turn tricks again.

571
01:01:54,243 --> 01:01:56,245
Did you manage to get my things?

572
01:01:59,148 --> 01:02:01,094
At least now I have clothes.

573
01:02:02,118 --> 01:02:05,725
Guess what happened?

574
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:07,964
Larissa is pissed.

575
01:02:08,925 --> 01:02:12,896
Clients keep asking for Brunei,
who looks like a surfer girl.

576
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:17,572
Now she understands
who kept that place going.

577
01:02:22,105 --> 01:02:25,245
That's it, Gobi, of course.

578
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:26,116
What?

579

Tomorrow at noon

596
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,273
Hi.

597
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:11,318
Welcome to Surfer Girl's place.

598
01:05:11,641 --> 01:05:14,212
Wow, very nice.

599
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,117
- LEl?
- Look at this...

600
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:21,556
You made a huge investment,
Brunei Surfer Girl.

601
01:05:23,953 --> 01:05:26,729
And you thought that
I wouldn't make it there.

602
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:30,331
Make it where exactly?

603
01:05:32,228 --> 01:05:34,504
I set up the
computer you gave me.

604
01:05:35,331 --> 01:05:36,401
I noticed.

605
01:05:38,567 --> 01:05:41,970

Brunei, I love reading about
your routine, tell me more...

610
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,703
Brunei, you're incredibly hot.
I enjoyed our chat. LO

611
01:06:48,704 --> 01:06:52,379
Are you a real call girl?
I love you S2 H!

612
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,355
<i>Right away, I realized that
the biog would set me apart.</i>

613
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,821
<i>I didn't make up
anything, that was my life.</i>

614
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:03,356
<i>And everyone was
curious about a call girl's life.</i>

615
01:07:05,121 --> 01:07:08,189
YESTERDAY WAS A BUSY DAY,
A LOT HAPPENED...

616
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,893
THE 1ST ONE ALMOST DIDN'T GET
THERE, BUT I WARMED HIM UP.

617
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:13,271
<i>I realized that besides
fooling around,</i>

618
01:07:13,329 --> 01:07:15,969
<i>guys loved to talk
about their problems.</i>

619
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:17,699
<i>And I liked to listen.</i>

620
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:20,201
- Where do you work?
- In a bank.

621
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:22,079
A bank! What do you do?

622
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:26,175
- I'm an business man.
- Dbl'?

623
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:33,856
My darling.

624
01:07:34,016 --> 01:07:35,723
She's so cute!

625
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,491
She is so smart!

626
01:07:41,524 --> 01:07:44,292
- You're so proud, aren't you?
- She's going places.

627
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:45,966
To this day I don't know
what my profession is.

628
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:52,605
I took a public service exam.
I start at 8am, leave at 6pm.

629
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:56,172
No one talks to each other.
I stare at the computer...

630
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:57,808
<i>I was the perfect woman.</i>

631
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:01,613
<i>I was there to fuck,
listen and never complain.</i>

632
01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:08,228
My wife doesn't help either.
She only worries about the dogs.

<i>Not bad for someone
who had low self-esteem.</i>

643
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,944
You're really hot.

644
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:38,456
I'm not the same Bruna you
met at the club

645
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,719
Now I'm a different Brunei...

646
01:08:41,784 --> 01:08:43,388
Brunei Surfer Girl.

647
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,763
It's the money.

648
01:09:07,743 --> 01:09:11,020
So, Brunei, if you had
to give me a score,

649
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:13,958
what score would it be?

650
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,220
What do you mean a score?

651
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,791
A score from 0 to 10?

652
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,934
It doesn't need to be
a standard score.

653
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:25,498
It could be some kind of rating:

654
01:09:26,428 --> 01:09:32,777
Good, hot, excellent,
incredible, loser, limp dick.

655
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:36,378
Let me think...

656
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:39,714
Excellent!

657
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:52,253
NEWS FLASH! FROM NOW ON
SURFER GIRL WILL RATE HER CLIENTS.

658
01:09:52,254 --> 01:09:55,924
3rd ROUND: BUSINESS MAN,
40 YEARS OLD. SOPHISTICATED.

659
01:09:55,925 --> 01:09:58,667
TOOK A WHILE TO WARM UP...

660
01:10:06,268 --> 01:10:09,477
<i>The ranking idea made
the biog even more popular.</i>

661
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,881
<i>I'd do 25 to 30 dates a week,</i>

662
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:14,888
<i>an average of 5, 6 dates a day,</i>

663
01:10:15,277 --> 01:10:17,689
which meant'
a lot of money. In cash.

664
01:10:26,522 --> 01:10:27,762
I thought you weren't coming.

665
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:30,391
SINGLE MAN.
KINKY BALD GUY.

666
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,827
HE WAS VERY HORNY.
HE TOOK FOREVER TO CUM.

667
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:34,362
NICE TIP.

668
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,969
It took me 6 months to get
enough money to bang you.

669
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:38,843
6 months?

670
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:46,946
MARRIED MAN. VERY KIND.

<i>or dirty.</i>

01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:54,287
<i>Men don't consider being
with a call girl, cheating,</i>

674
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:57,596

NEW COMMENTS

677
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,237
- Want a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

678
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,274
My Wife!

679
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:15,374
Tell her you're at the airport.

680
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:19,919
Hi, babe, miss you.

681
01:11:25,748 --> 01:11:27,523
Just a couple more

682
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:29,557
Hold your breath
and it'll work better.

683
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:34,891
That's it, cutie.

684
01:11:35,090 --> 01:11:41,439
Give this baby
some tea, cause I like it

685
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,097
Drink it all.

686

<i>I don't think of myself as

Brunei Surfer Girl
saved a lot of marriages

688
01:12:14,563 --> 01:12:16,873
Living the high life, girl.

689
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,314
Turn the volume down.

690
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,088
Brunei Surfer Girl.

691
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,399
It's your boyfriend.

692
01:12:45,294 --> 01:12:46,830
Hi, handsome.

693
01:12:47,363 --> 01:12:48,569
<i>I read your biog.</i>

694
01:12:49,598 --> 01:12:52,943
I saw what you posted
about your fabulous clients.

695
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,837
They think the world of you.

696
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,044
<i>I'm pissed off.</i>

697
01:12:57,106 --> 01:13:00,679
I can't believe
you'd be jealous, -Huldson.

698
01:13:00,876 --> 01:13:05,757
I want compensation
for all this debauchery.

699
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:11,427
You and me.
Dinner. At a restaurant

700
01:13:12,054 --> 01:13:13,658
There's a place
I want to take you.

701
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:16,931
- I charge for out calls.
- You can charge me.

702
01:13:17,192 --> 01:13:20,495
Out calls are twice the price.

703
01:13:20,496 --> 01:13:21,531
<i>Think about it.</i>

704
01:13:22,598 --> 01:13:26,978
Your professionalism and
the vulgarity of your biog...

705
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:30,015
You can't imagine
how horny that makes me

706
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,115
<i>Follow me, please.</i>

707
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,552
Make yourselves comfortable
and have a nice dinner.

708
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:45,896
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

709
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:53,899
So, do you like it?

710
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:56,933
This place is amazing.

711
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,908
And to think no client
had ever asked me to dinner.

712
01:14:02,771 --> 01:14:05,183
That's because you don't
accept the good things.

713
01:14:11,747 --> 01:14:14,557
Yet you keep finding me special?

714
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,432
L- Listen, Bruna...
or whatever your name is.

715
01:14:22,825 --> 01:14:29,071
I know that somewhere inside
you lives an amazing person

716
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,811
that you killed off
for some reason.

717
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:35,680
And I want to find out why.

718
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:45,855
I brought you something.

719
01:14:59,461 --> 01:15:02,237
Stop playing a role.

720
01:15:16,845 --> 01:15:18,347
I don't deserve this.

721
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:21,627
It's yours.

722
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:36,842
Hi, Gobi.

723
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:42,645
I'm on a date,
tell them to wait.

724
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,549
It's gorgeous

725
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:04,160
Fine.

726
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:12,843
But later, when you're
fucking those guys,

727
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:16,776
remember very well
the life you chose.

728
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,451
I hope you have a lot of fun

729
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:27,318
OK. It's scheduled.

730
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:32,190
Do you have any
fetishes in particular

731
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,165
a fantasy, something?

732
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,894
Sure. That's what we're here for.

733
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:43,043
Hold on a sec.

734
01:16:44,466 --> 01:16:46,946
Hello? Who?

735
01:16:50,539 --> 01:16:52,018
Fucking hell!

736
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:55,814
Wake up.

737
01:16:56,244 --> 01:16:57,086
Client!

738
01:16:58,280 --> 01:17:00,817
- Wake up, Brunei
- I'm sleeping.

739
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,558
Get up

740
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:05,462
I'm sleeping, god dammit.

741
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:09,632
Let's go, let's go.

742
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:17,868
I had a dinner yesterday,
a bachelor party with 8 guys...

743
01:17:17,933 --> 01:17:19,879
It's our fourth
cancellation this week!

744
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,972
Soon we won't
have any clients left.

745
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:26,675
Who gets fucked
to support this shit?

746
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,552
Want to trade?

747
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:38,530
Now she is rating the guys.

748
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:43,592
- Look at this picture.
- She looks gorgeous.

749
01:17:46,461 --> 01:17:48,907
<i>I started blogging about my clients,</i>

750
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,965
<i>but after awhile I became
the main subject.</i>

751
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,277
<i>- Brunei, I want to interview you
- You are so hot!</i>

752
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:58,716
<i>- How much for the whole night?
- Write some tips on your biog.</i>

<i>- Show me your boobs.

754
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:06,480
<i>- I love you, marry me!
- I want to go to your party.</i>

755
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:09,050
<i>Do you really surf?</i>

756
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:11,861
<i>My web page had more than
10 thousand views a day.</i>

757
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:14,230
<i>I became a hit on the web</i>

758
01:18:15,290 --> 01:18:18,533
<i>And I finally understood why
people want to become celebrities.</i>

759
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:21,140
<i>It's not for the fame,
but to be loved.</i>

760
01:18:35,310 --> 01:18:38,416
Great. Everything is perfect.

761
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:44,318
There's only one
Brunei Surfer girl.

762
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,253
She's lucky, honey.

763
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:47,955
You're jealous.

764
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:50,835
You gotta pay
to have a piece of this.

765
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:56,001
Don't forget to thank them.
Thanking is classy. OK?

766
01:18:56,064 --> 01:18:58,203
I'm starting to get anxious.

767
01:18:58,366 --> 01:19:01,973
Our company is called
Kelly & Mel, get it?

768
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:04,742
Mollycoddle. com. BR

769
01:19:06,441 --> 01:19:11,186
Girls, you look gorgeous.

770
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:13,382
How is Brunei doing?

771
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:17,519
She is great. Very excited,
a lot of positive energy.

772
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:21,261
Shouldn't she make a more
discreet entrance, greet people...

773
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:24,992
No way, sugar.
You're narrow minded

774
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:28,600
We still have a surprise
at the end. I'll handle it.

775
01:19:41,042 --> 01:19:43,079
<i>Goddess!</i>

776
01:19:46,681 --> 01:19:50,026
You are so hot!

777
01:19:52,387 --> 01:19:54,230
Brunei, I love you

778
01:19:55,624 --> 01:19:57,035
Good evening.

779
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:03,903
What a beautiful, sexy,
and horny crowd.

780
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:09,078
I'm very happy to be here,

781
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:11,845
at this parti that

782
01:20:14,743 --> 01:20:17,349
It's a dream I was
able to accomplish,

783
01:20:17,412 --> 01:20:20,222
because I never stopped
believing in what I wanted.

784
01:20:20,282 --> 01:20:25,493
That's why you have to
fight for what you believe in.

785
01:20:25,554 --> 01:20:27,830
You can be someone as well.

786
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:29,393
That's it.

787
01:20:29,958 --> 01:20:31,699
That's always it.

788
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,935
Now I'm going to
call a friend of mine,

789
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:39,501
my friend Carol,
who put this party together

790
01:20:39,768 --> 01:20:42,874
We have a little surprise for you.

791
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,646
Happy birthday, girl.

792
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:51,317
I have one thing to say.

793
01:20:51,446 --> 01:20:55,553
Here at my best friend's Birthday,

794
01:20:55,617 --> 01:20:59,353
You're the ones
who get the presents!

795
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:03,324
Brunei Surfer Girl is
yours tonight for free.

796
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:05,828
Listen, everyone, get in line.

797
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:09,270
Calm down, people.

798
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,434
Here is your number.

799
01:21:14,736 --> 01:21:17,444
Do you have a number?

800
01:21:27,749 --> 01:21:30,889
Quit it, Gobi.
Ghetto insecurity.

801
01:21:30,952 --> 01:21:36,334
Wake up, don't you get it?
I'm Brunei. Brunei Surfer Girl.

01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:41,231
Plexiglas.

803
01:21:41,696 --> 01:21:43,607
Everyone wants to fuck me.

804
01:21:43,965 --> 01:21:44,909
Go on.

805
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,044
Do you doubt me? Choose one...

806
01:21:48,103 --> 01:21:49,878
Cut the bullshit.

807
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:53,383
You're spending too much
snorting like crazy.

808
01:21:53,541 --> 01:21:56,954
If you want to keep this up,
I'd rather you call your girlfriend,

809
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:58,922
whose only concern
is her own line of coke.

810
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,720
Carol, your problem is Carol.

811
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:06,156
What is it?
Are you jealous of Carol?

812
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:08,657
Or maybe you envy her?

813
01:22:08,890 --> 01:22:09,766
Envy?!

814
01:22:10,225 --> 01:22:13,536
Envious of a bloodsucker
who depends on a geezer?

815
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,906
I prefer to open my legs
for 20 bucks.

816
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,205
So that's it.

817
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:22,339
Carol does her job, you do
yours and stop bothering me

818
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:27,681
If you don't want it,
quit, it won't matter to me

819
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:36,452
That's what I'll do.

820
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:38,227
I'm leaving.

821
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:44,503
This way, both of you can
fuck up the rest of your life.

822
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:47,368
Don't overdo it. Come on.

823
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:51,740
You're the one overdoing it
and you don't even realize it.

824
01:22:51,866 --> 01:22:52,844
By the way,

825
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,711
don't forget to pay these bills

826
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,280
for that fancy party
Carol threw for you.

827
01:23:23,398 --> 01:23:29,110
Hey, I need a break, alright?

828
01:23:30,271 --> 01:23:34,808
Let me go! Let me go!
Your time is over, let me go!

829
01:23:34,809 --> 01:23:36,610
Your time is over,
It's only one hour.

830
01:23:36,611 --> 01:23:37,715
Are you out of your mind, fuck!

831
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:38,723
What?

832
01:23:40,081 --> 01:23:43,221
Be cool, I'm going to write good
thing about you on my Blog.

833
01:23:44,486 --> 01:23:46,432
I thought you were professional.

834
01:23:47,455 --> 01:23:48,661
Surfer girl!

835
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,099
Take it!

836
01:23:55,930 --> 01:23:58,001
Your services are really bad.

837
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,040
Brunei?

838
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:04,942
Brunei?

839
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:14,916
I'm going to drink some
water and then we'll start.

840
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:23,230
Today I'm talking
to Brunei Surfer girl.

841
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,860
Brunei, how did it
feel to be awarded

842
01:24:26,861 --> 01:24:28,431
for the top blog of the year.

843
01:24:28,596 --> 01:24:32,567
Did you imagine that
your biog was this popular?

844
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,979
I don't know if this much.

845
01:24:35,937 --> 01:24:37,712
Did success change your routine?

846
01:24:37,906 --> 01:24:41,854
What are you going
to do after this interview?

847
01:24:43,545 --> 01:24:47,891
I'll wait for my clients
as I always do.

848
01:24:48,149 --> 01:24:50,755
I want to thank
everyone who nailed me.

849
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:55,189
My fee is the same and I haven't
stopped because I'm famous.

850
01:24:55,190 --> 01:25:02,165
If you want to fuck me, visit
my blog at Brunelleschi. com.

851
01:25:02,797 --> 01:25:03,707
What else?

852
01:25:48,643 --> 01:25:49,348
Brunei.

853
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:52,319
Come in.

854
01:25:53,148 --> 01:25:56,527
Excuse me.
I scheduled with Gobi

855
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,795
Gobi doesn't work here any more.

856
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:05,366
I booked a time with her.

857
01:26:09,597 --> 01:26:11,732
I looked for you
everywhere, babe.

858
01:26:11,733 --> 01:26:15,010
I went to where you worked,
but they didn't know about you.

859
01:26:15,303 --> 01:26:18,409
There are a few new girls
over there, nothing interesting.

860
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:23,447
Haven't you heard
about the internet?

861
01:26:23,845 --> 01:26:27,190
Blog, Brunei Surfer Girl's blog?

862
01:26:29,017 --> 01:26:32,692
Nice place. You have
a pool, you can sunbathe.

863
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:35,631
30?

864
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:36,891
30?

865
01:26:38,092 --> 01:26:41,335
Are we fucking or do you
intend to keep up this little chat?

866
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:47,212
300 Raise.

867
01:26:48,469 --> 01:26:52,281
This is entertainment.
I don't work with charity.

868
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:53,951
I see.

869
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:00,617
<i>Sorry, my bad?
I think I got it all wrong</i>

870
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:04,993
This isn't what I expected...

871
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:11,688
TODAY I TOOK THE DAY OFF. AFTER ALL,
SURFER GIRL NEEDS TO REST.

872
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:18,636
COME BY TOMORROW.
SHOW UP, I'M WAITING FOR YOU.

873
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:37,225
LET ME KNOW WHEN YOU CUT
THE PRICE. I'LL BRING SOME FRIENDS.

874
01:28:14,622 --> 01:28:15,896
Cut me a line.

875
01:28:16,157 --> 01:28:18,068
- Sorry?
- Cut me a line.

876
01:28:19,827 --> 01:28:21,670
Didn't you sleep last night?

877
01:28:22,630 --> 01:28:25,440
- Half and half, right?
- This is mine.

878
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,009
This doesn't even cover
half of what you owe me.

879
01:28:29,704 --> 01:28:32,480
So take more then half.
Leave some for me.

880
01:28:35,843 --> 01:28:39,086
Take care. Call me.

881
01:29:11,979 --> 01:29:14,585
- I'm going to take these.
- Just a second, please.

882
01:29:16,517 --> 01:29:18,463
I'm going to grab
some beer inside.

883
01:29:18,619 --> 01:29:19,529
Where is the beer?

884
01:29:20,755 --> 01:29:21,961
What is your code?

885
01:29:25,426 --> 01:29:28,896
- - I'll pay for these with the gas.
- G.

886
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:33,838
I'm taking these.

887
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:22,382
Carol.

888
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:28,715
Carol, open the door.
I know you're in there.

889
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:33,825
Open this fucking door.
I swear I'll pay you.

890
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:59,240
- L.- Lady, .which number is up?
- Number 23.

891
01:33:22,830 --> 01:33:26,573
They told me this girl is hot.

892
01:33:36,477 --> 01:33:38,423
Line up, boys

893
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:42,023
It's gonna be a long day.

894
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:48,564
Come on.

895
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:07,808
Next!

896
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:20,296
Next!

897
01:34:31,432 --> 01:34:32,376
Next!

898
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:02,904
Someone help me,
she passed out.

899
01:35:03,898 --> 01:35:05,309
Someone help.

900
01:35:45,573 --> 01:35:47,018
Emergency room 2.

901
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:27,553
You'll be fine.

902
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,393
What are you doing here?

903
01:36:34,455 --> 01:36:36,435
I brought you some clothes.

904
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:43,272
What happened?

905
01:36:48,836 --> 01:36:50,110
I'm tired.

906
01:37:05,753 --> 01:37:07,596
I'm spending
New Year's at the beach

907
01:37:08,122 --> 01:37:09,192
Do you want to come?

908
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:22,548
I really want you
to change your life.

909
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,583
I want to be with you.

910
01:37:30,044 --> 01:37:31,284
I've got everything.

911
01:37:33,781 --> 01:37:35,385
You don't have to worry

912
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:40,328
You can go back to your studies,

913
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,425
graduate high school,

914
01:37:44,592 --> 01:37:46,593
study psychology...

915
01:37:46,594 --> 01:37:48,198
- Stop the car
- What?

916
01:37:48,796 --> 01:37:50,366
Please, stop the car.

917
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,543
You are very sweet
you know that?

918
01:38:36,677 --> 01:38:39,021
I just wish you
could understand me.

919
01:38:41,715 --> 01:38:45,060
I left my parents' house,
so I wouldn't depend on anyone

920
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,199
So I could have my own life.

921
01:39:01,635 --> 01:39:02,579
Raquel.

922
01:39:07,474 --> 01:39:08,418
My name

923
01:39:11,612 --> 01:39:13,182
My name is Raquel.

924
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:49,226
<i>Sometimes I miss my old life,</i>

925
01:39:50,084 --> 01:39:51,757
<i>my dad, my mom,</i>

926
01:39:52,286 --> 01:39:54,323
<i>I even miss my house.</i>

927
01:39:56,256 --> 01:39:59,225
<i>I think I miss the
family! wanted to have</i>

928
01:39:59,226 --> 01:40:01,570
<i>more than the family I had.</i>

929
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,335
<i>I'm proud of myself,</i>

930
01:40:08,302 --> 01:40:10,373
<i>I met all kinds of people.</i>

931
01:40:11,005 --> 01:40:12,848
<i>I allowed myself
to be another person.</i>

932
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:16,709
<i>I also made bad choices.
But if it wasn't this way,</i>

933
01:40:16,710 --> 01:40:20,385
<i>I'd never learn to love
myself for who I am.</i>

934
01:40:22,649 --> 01:40:24,822
<i>That's why y I'm telling this story,</i>

935
01:40:25,285 --> 01:40:27,128
<i>so I'll never forget it.</i>

936
01:40:28,122 --> 01:40:31,592
<i>It was as a call girl that
I truly found myself.</i>

937
01:40:31,925 --> 01:40:33,427
<i>I learned a lot of things.</i>

938
01:40:35,496 --> 01:40:37,797
<i>Maybe if I never
left my parents' house,</i>

939
01:40:37,798 --> 01:40:39,675
<i>my relationship with them
would have gone back to normal.</i>

940
01:40:40,467 --> 01:40:43,277
<i>Brunei wouldn't
have existed, only Raquel.</i>

941
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:48,342
<i>Only Brunei could reach
this conclusion, not Raquel.</i>

942
01:40:50,677 --> 01:40:52,315
<i>I'll stop turning tricks.</i>

943
01:40:52,980 --> 01:40:56,359
<i>I want to marry and
have children like everybody else</i>

944
01:40:57,184 --> 01:41:00,063
<i>Before I do that, I need to save
enough money to live comfortably.</i>

945
01:41:01,121 --> 01:41:03,123
<i>I'll work for another 6 months,</i>

946
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:06,204
<i>it'll be about 700, 800 dates.</i>

947
01:41:07,694 --> 01:41:09,264
<i>If I ever leave this life,</i>

948
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:11,634
<i>I want to leave it
the same way I started,</i>

949
01:41:12,833 --> 01:41:15,040
<i>accepting that it was my choice.</i>

950
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:16,072
Come in.

951
01:41:23,343 --> 01:41:28,343
AFTER 6 MONTHS,
RAQUEL STOPPED TURNING TRICKS

952
01:41:29,283 --> 01:41:30,983
SHE WROTE THE BOOK
"THE SCORPION'S SWEET VENON",

953
01:41:30,984 --> 01:41:34,253

250 THOUSAND COPIES IN BRAZIL...

954
01:41:34,254 --> 01:41:36,289
AND WAS TRANSLATED
INTO 15 LANGUAGES.

955
01:41:36,290 --> 01:41:41,290
TODAY RAQUEL LIVES
WITH AN EX-CLIENT.

956
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:51,315
SHE NEVER TALKED
TO HER PARENTS AGAIN.
