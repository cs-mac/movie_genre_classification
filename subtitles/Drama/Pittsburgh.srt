1
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,395
<i>Not so many months ago,</i>
<i>the president asked the nation...</i>

2
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,270
<i>for 60,000 planes, 45,000 tanks</i>
<i>and 8 million tons of ships.</i>

3
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,271
<i>He asked this from the hearts,</i>
<i>minds and hands...</i>

4
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,114
<i>of 130 million free men,</i>
<i>women and children.</i>

5
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,557
<i>He asked us to evolve</i>
<i>the greatest and most efficient</i>
<i>industrial system in history;</i>

6
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,393
<i>to turn our workshops</i>
<i>into mighty forges of war;</i>

7
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,870
<i>to out-build the aggressors</i>
<i>in every category of modern arms.</i>

8
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,791
<i>In his very words...</i>

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,270
"Only by this accomplishment
can we build the arsenal of democracy."

10
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,672
Planes, guns, tanks and ships have begun
to flow from our factories and yards.

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,594
The flow is accelerating from day to day.
The stream is becoming a river.

12
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,832
The river will become a torrent,
a torrent that will engulf...

13
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,310
the totalitarian tyranny which
seeks to destroy the world.

14
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:35,478
Our answer to the request of the president
flies from atop our flagpole today.

15
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,391
<i>The credit for</i>
<i>its flying there...</i>

16
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,630
<i>belongs to each</i>
<i>and every one of you.</i>

17
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,109
To my partner,
Pittsburgh Markham.

18
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,909
To your friend and mine,
a man, who many years ago...

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,710
saw more in a lump of coal than anybody
else in the world, Doc Powers.

20
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,629
To your union leader,
as much responsible for the maintenance...

21
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,996
of our production schedule
as any executive of this firm, Joe Malneck.

22
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,958
But most of all,
it belongs to you.

23
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,237
<i>For you are the partners</i>
<i>of our American boys</i>
<i>who are shedding their blood...</i>

24
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:23,710
on the stormy waters of the North Atlantic,
the desert wastes of Africa...

25
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,554
the rocky crags of the Aleutians,
the steaming jungles of the South Pacific.

26
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,270
For all over the world our partners are
fighting because they know as we know...

27
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,828
that America is more
than a country; it's a cause.

28
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,356
A way of life that is given
even to the poorest man...

29
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,638
more than he could dream of
anywhere else in the world.

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,235
What do you say we show
those boys we're behind them...

31
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,472
and get back to work?

32
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,230
To the three of us.

33
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:09,949
The four of us.
Don't forget Hunky.

34
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,391
To Hunky.

35
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,755
To Hunky.

36
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,628
You boys might've
spent your lives in darkness...

37
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,790
if it hadn't been for that girl.

38
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,873
I give her credit for my success too,
for I came up with you.

39
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,714
Remember those days
when I was an old nut
with ideas about coal...

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,395
and you two were gay young blades
of Coal Town?

41
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,155
<i>Coal Town was your oyster then,</i>
<i>filled with black pearls...</i>

42
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,071
<i>but you couldn't see them.</i>

43
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,709
<i>Maybe it was the sooty mist</i>
<i>hanging over the shabby streets</i>
<i>that hid them from you...</i>

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,396
<i>as you marched with the daily swarm of</i>
<i>other men up the hill to Wilson's colliery.</i>

45
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,995
<i>A man does not see well when he lives</i>
<i>too long away from the sun.</i>

46
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,153
<i>But like the power in the coal you dug,</i>
<i>locked deep in the earth</i>
<i>for a million years...</i>

47
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,515
<i>the force in you</i>
<i>still awaited release.</i>

48
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,116
<i>And the stench and grime of Shaft</i>
<i>Number 7 was part of your heritage.</i>

49
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,633
<i>Hey, that's awful!</i>

50
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,429
- I ran into Joe Malneck this morning,
that guy from the union.
- Yeah?

51
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,239
- He's gonna make
a deal for us with Wilson.
- What kind of a deal, Johnny?

52
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,471
- Startin' next week,
we get six cents more a ton.
- Six cents?

53
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,916
- We'll never get fat
on that kinda dough.
- Well, it adds up to around...

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,596
- 12 to 15 bucks a month.
- That'll put a lot more grub
on our table.

55
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,071
- What're ya gonna do with yours,
Johnny? Buy a yacht?
- Aw, go on and laugh.

56
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,037
It ain't much,
but it's a starter.

57
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,796
You guys have been shinin'
them bug torches in your eyes
so long you're dizzy.

58
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,156
What're you doin', Pittsburgh?
Pickin' coal or posin' for a statue?

59
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,959
Come on,
get hot on that banjo.

60
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:54,670
- How'd ya like to have me play a
tune around your ears with it?

61
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,591
<i>- Hello, fellas.</i>
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hello.

62
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,558
- You hear about the deal
we put over with the company?
- You're doin' a swell job...

63
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,996
- since you threw away your pick.
- First thing you know,
we'll be millionaires.

64
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,312
- We'll be rollin' in dough.
Lend me five bucks, will ya?
- Can't hear ya.

65
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,358
- I said, five clankers.
- I got coal dust in my ears.

66
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,238
You were flush when we left
the room this morning.

67
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,630
Aw, all right.
Here's two bucks. It's all I got.

68
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,314
- How do ya expect me to
get anywhere on two bucks?
- I don't.

69
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,949
Don't even expect to get it back.
All you do is spend my dough
on your hunky gal.

70
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,032
I'm through with those bo-hunk babes.
This one's a classy, long-legged dame...

71
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,680
that's got everything...
and a Model "T".

72
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,355
- I wonder where we can get a drink?
- Over at Barney's Speak.

73
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,556
<i>I didn't say "buy a drink."</i>

74
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,953
- Hey, Doc, where are ya?
- Quiet!

75
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,235
He usually keeps that
prescription stuff in here.

76
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,151
What's that?

77
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,549
They still must be working on
Number 5 down there.

78
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,031
<i>The tunnel's underneath.</i>
<i>If they aren't careful, they'll</i>
<i>completely undermine the house.</i>

79
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,190
Hello, boys.

80
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,316
- Hello, Doc.
- Hiya, Doc.
- Somebody sick?

81
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,551
- Uh... yeah, it's Cash's stomach.
- My stomach?

82
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,030
Look at him, he's all bent over.
We didn't wanna bother ya,
knowin' how busy ya are.

83
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,714
Well, I'm never too busy
to look out for my patients.

84
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,155
However, I don't
keep the whisky...

85
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,038
in that cabinet any more.

86
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,477
- Come in here, Cash.
- He don't keep the whisky
in that cabinet any more.

87
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,596
You know, Doc,
I'm not feelin' so good myself.

88
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,798
- You boys know Dr. Grazlich,
my junior partner.
- Hi, Junior.

89
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,553
- I'm feelin' sicker than Cash.
- Here, down this.

90
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,234
I'll be glad when
Prohibition's over.

91
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,198
<i>- That stuff tastes like coal tar.</i>
- It is coal tar.

92
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,829
At least it's a derivative
of coal tar. Cash?

93
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,639
Mm, not for me.
I feel all right now.

94
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,837
Go on, take it.
It's good for your stomach.

95
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,911
Mm. No, thanks, Doc.

96
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,549
- Much better for you than whisky.
- I'll take whisky.

97
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,269
A hundred years ago,
they threw the coal tar away
when they made coke.

98
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,875
Then they realized
it was good for everything
from munitions to medicine.

99
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,871
We have barely scratched
its possibilities.

100
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,589
- What are you lookin' for now?
- We don't exactly know.

101
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,070
- How do you know if you find it?
- Because it'll be something new...

102
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,390
something we haven't found.

103
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,270
You see, when scientists find
a waste in nature's gifts,
they accept that as a challenge.

104
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,591
And no gifts have been lavished
more profusely than in coal.

105
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,116
- Now, you take that one little piece.
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,591
That's composed of several
elements that have been combined
and changed by nature...

107
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,877
<i>over thousands of years into a mixture</i>
<i>of very complex compounds.</i>

108
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,397
Our job is to split those compounds and
then recombine them to suit our needs.

109
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,836
<i>Hundreds of compounds have been made,</i>
<i>but many others are still possible.</i>

110
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,435
A hundred and 50 years ago,
a man put lumps of coal in water...

111
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,592
<i>and had</i>
<i>the sick drink it.</i>

112
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,797
He was burned at the stake. The methods
employed then were very primitive.

113
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,872
But ever since then, scientists
have followed the same principle.

114
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,397
Dr. Grazlich and I are only
two men out of thousands
who are going on with the work.

115
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,392
You can have that bottle, Pittsburgh.
You'd talk me out of it, anyway.

116
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,597
I love ya, Doc.
So help me, I love ya.

117
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,958
Well, a pint of whisky, two bucks
and a date. Now all I need's
a decent suit of clothes.

118
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,874
- Come on, Cash. So long Doc.
- Goodbye, Doc. So long, Junior.

119
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,633
For a ready-made suit, he looks just like
a "Breau Bummel!" Such style, such class.

120
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,473
- Believe me, I wouldn't
know my own merchandise.
- Figure it up, Shorty.

121
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,391
With pleasure.

122
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,670
What're you gonna
use for money?

123
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,877
I don't know. Used to call you Cash
because you always had some.

124
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,953
But lately you've put me
in some very embarrassing positions.

125
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,589
I wonder how much it would take
to make him careless?

126
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,798
One suit at the special price of $18.
There's buckram,
there's piping, there's lining.

127
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:48,032
<i>- And accessories</i>
<i>brings it up to $33.50.</i>
- Fine. Have a drink.

128
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,635
Oh, thank you, thank you.

129
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,234
- Expensive stuff.
- What's money?

130
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,197
Sure. Don't mean a thing.

131
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,796
Thanks all the same, but I don't drink.
Now, what were you saying about money?

132
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,077
- About these duds, put 'em
on the cuff, will ya?
- Cuff? Whose cuff?

133
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,991
- Your cuff, Shorty.
- My cuff?

134
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,436
Play along with me, and one day
I'll let you make me custom-made suits.

135
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:13,433
Never mind that. The custom
today is cash. You're not gonna
swing any pickaxe in my suit.

136
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,909
- Take it off or I'll call the police.
- Wait a minute.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,639
Come back with my suit!
I told you, positively no credit.

138
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,915
You didn't even
give me a deposit.

139
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,798
You got nothin' to worry about, Shorty.
Look at that sign.

140
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,032
"A hundred dollars in gold to any man
who can stay three minutes in the ring...

141
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,429
with the heavyweight champion,
Killer Kane."

142
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:33,398
It's an invitation to your own funeral.
I sold the Killer a suit.

143
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,948
He's got a 48-inch chest,
a 23-inch arm...

144
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,554
- and a 19 neck.
- And a six-inch skull.

145
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,074
- You'll do no fightin' in my suit.
- Come on, Cash.

146
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,594
- Suppose he flattens you?
- He won't flatten me.

147
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,797
- Not in my suit!
- Nothin's gonna happen to your suit.

148
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,791
My suit!
Look at my suit!

149
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,273
- For a lead nickel,
I'd smash your teeth in!
- Is anything wrong?

150
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,670
Plenty!
I oughta pull-

151
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,752
Oh, you got
your suit muddy.

152
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:09,230
His suit? My suit! He walks outta my shop
with a brand-new suit.

153
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,390
<i>Then he wants to fight Killer Kane</i>
<i>in my suit. Now look at it!</i>

154
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,914
<i>- He didn't even gimme a deposit!</i>
- Quiet, Shorty.

155
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,232
- It's nothing, Countess, nothing at all.
- I'm so very sorry.

156
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,154
- It's awful, awful!
- It's awful nice.

157
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,038
Good evening. Mr. Brawley's
down front, right aisle.

158
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,111
Thank you.

159
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,272
How about your date with
the long-legged gal with the Model "T"?

160
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,670
I like this chassis better.

161
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,069
Tickets, please.

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,709
- Uh, Shorty, you forgot
to buy the tickets.
- I forgot to buy the tickets.

163
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,792
Three tickets, and I'm not
gonna like the show.

164
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,955
- Your coat.
- My suit! I'll be right back.

165
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,993
Hey, down in front.
Sit down, will ya?

166
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,355
Find someplace. I wanna see the show.

167
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,392
- Where's your collar?
- I got it right here.

168
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,755
Put your neck
in it. Here.

169
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,954
Hey, down in front.
Will you park your body? The clinch is on.

170
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:24,477
There ya are. The cost of the tickets
brings it up to $35 even.

171
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,035
- He don't look so tough.
- I'm glad that's not
my head he's punching.

172
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,558
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've just witnessed a masterful
exhibition of bag punching...

173
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,870
by the undefeated marvel
of the prize ring...

174
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:59,633
and contender of the world's
heavyweight championship, Killer Kane!

175
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,715
And now, gentlemen,
one hundred dollars for the man
who'll remain on his feet...

176
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,234
<i>- after three minutes of boxing</i>
<i>with Killer Kane.</i>
- Bring 'im on!

177
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,551
He wants a fight, does he?
I'll fight him for nothing!

178
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,952
- Come on!
- Oh, no, you don't, mister.
You're plastered! Sit down.

179
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,796
Who'll be the first to challenge the Killer
to one round of exhibition boxing?

180
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,838
- I'm callin' you, Butch.
- Come on, sucker.

181
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,559
Come on. A fella needs
a second, doesn't he?

182
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:33,313
- We'll fix his-
- Come on, sit down!

183
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,951
- Please, boys, don't fight in my suit.
- Hello, Countess.

184
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,918
- Who is the challenger?
- Not me!

185
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,309
Coal miners, eh?

186
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,198
What's the matter
with coal miners?

187
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,032
We carried four of 'em out
this afternoon.

188
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,511
Yeah, well, here's one you aren't gonna
carry out. Cash Evans. That right, boys?

189
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:00,792
You dirty double-crosser!

190
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,599
- What's the matter, you afraid of him?
- Afraid? Why, I'll knock...

191
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,875
that big palooka
right in the countess' lap!

192
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,712
Sit tight, Countess.

193
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,756
<i>- That palooka's gonna</i>
<i>land in your lap.</i>
- Aren't you fighting?

194
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,037
Me? I've been changing
a lot of my plans this evening.

195
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,634
- Friend of yours?
- No.

196
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,474
I'm gonna change that too.

197
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,358
Who is he?

198
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,433
Nobody. He seems awfully sure
of himself, doesn't he?

199
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,754
Who do you want us to notify
in case you're killed?

200
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,230
- What if that coal slinger
throws a lucky punch?
- He better not.

201
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,198
I spent a lot of dough
building up that big baboon.

202
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,556
You're looking at the next title-holder,
baby- Champion Killer Kane.

203
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,108
And when that happens,
you're gonna have everything.

204
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,589
You already told me
I had everything.

205
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,910
Let's have a good fight
and don't dawdle.

206
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,468
Shake hands and go to your corner
and come out punching.

207
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,155
- Watch yourself. This guy's dynamite.
- You just think of that?

208
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:11,235
Keep that left goin' Cash!
Attaboy!

209
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,278
That's it! Stick your left out!
You know what it means to me!

210
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,796
Let him have it!

211
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,155
What're ya backin' up for?

212
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,069
A right! Hit him with
a right! He's a big phony!

213
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,515
Wise guy, eh?

214
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,119
- If that dummy loses this fight, I'll-
- Lose a hundred dollars.

215
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,233
<i>Keep it up, Cash.</i>
<i>Two minutes to go.</i>

216
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,829
<i>- One, two, three...</i>
- How'm I doin'?

217
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,356
- Not so hot. He just slipped.
<i>- four, five, six-</i>

218
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:11,872
That's it! Go ahead!

219
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,952
<i>You got him goin', Cash!</i>
<i>He's groggy! What's holding him up?</i>

220
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,396
<i>Keep that left goin'!</i>
<i>That's it, use the other hand!</i>

221
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,917
Your right, your right!
In the breadbasket!

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,673
<i>Keep it up,</i>
<i>the suit's almost mine!</i>

223
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,999
<i>Duck that light, Cash!</i>

224
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:34,799
- Go on, get up!
- Get up! Get up!

225
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,555
<i>- Get up, Cash!</i>
<i>He didn't hurt ya!</i>
...two, three, four...

226
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,438
<i>- Come on, take him!</i>
- five.

227
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:53,397
Gimme that dough!

228
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,471
Come on, Cash,
here's your dough!

229
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,120
<i>Get the cops! Police!</i>

230
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,473
There's your boyfriend, Countess!

231
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,030
Nice company you keep, Countess.

232
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,159
It's me, it's me.
Congratulations, you won.

233
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,835
- Here you are, Shorty.
Forty bucks and keep the tip.
- Thank you, thank you.

234
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,756
It's a pleasure to do business
with honest men.

235
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,950
I'm glad you officers arrived.
It's terrible inside.

236
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:59,397
- Some boisterous characters
started a fight in there.
- Oh, they did? Come on, boys.

237
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,351
Musical little things, aren't they?

238
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,079
They're gonna do a Charleston
right down Barney's Bar.

239
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,675
Heh-heh, I love ya, Cash.
So help me, Hannah, I love ya.

240
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,038
- Now, if we can only find the countess.
- Yeah, she's so sympathetic.

241
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,871
- What's the dope?
- Big cave-in at Eversville, Tunnel 5.

242
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,112
- You hear that? Tunnel 5.
- Holy smokes, that's right under
Doc's house.

243
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,954
Hey, buddy, run us out to Eversville-
There's no one here.

244
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,077
It's the countess' car.
Let's take it. Come on.

245
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:47,958
- What's the big idea?
- Uh-oh, the countess.

246
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,112
- You'll get in plenty of trouble
stealing this car.
- Oh, cool off, Countess.

247
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,079
There's a cave-in at the mine.

248
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,751
Look out!

249
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,710
<i>- Where do you think you're goin'?</i>
- Get outta the way, O'Toole.

250
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,836
- We've got to find Doc Powers.
- Sure. Go ahead, Pitt.

251
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,030
Dr. Grazlich! Doc, I'm glad you're all right.
Where's Doc Powers?

252
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,033
- His house didn't cave in?
- No, the cave-in was underground.
Caught some of the night shift.

253
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,429
- But where is Doc?
- Down there someplace.

254
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:47,830
- Hold that cage!
- Hey, Doc's trapped in Number 5.

255
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:52,277
We were on our way up
when the whole wall caved in.
We need more help.

256
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,229
This is no place for you, Countess.
You'll get your nose dirty.

257
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,993
Never mind about that.

258
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,397
- Hey, Doc!
<i>- Here, boys!</i>

259
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,471
<i>Look out for that beam.</i>

260
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,313
This shoring's apt to
give away any minute!

261
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,598
- We'll have you out in no time.
- I said, stand back!

262
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,518
It- It's my leg.

263
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,479
- Steady, Doc, you'll be all right.
- Well, hello, Miss Nightingale.

264
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,676
Okay, Pitt.

265
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,351
Drag him out!

266
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,190
Look out!

267
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:14,789
Don't worry, Tilda.
Dr. Grazlich's a fine doctor.

268
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,509
Did your husband
get hurt too?

269
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,832
- Bill!
- Tilda, that thick skull you was
always talking about saved me.

270
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,630
- You fool!
- They'd like to break
the needle sewing him up.

271
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,553
Your man's okay.
You can go in now.

272
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,552
You boys wait here.

273
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,631
How is Dr. Powers?

274
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,393
Got a busted leg.
Wouldn't let Grazlich work on him...

275
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,472
'til everybody else
was taken care of.

276
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,791
You seemed to know what it was all about
down there, Countess.

277
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,836
Pitched in like a regular hunky.

278
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,196
That's what they used to call me
when I was a kid, "Hunky."

279
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,033
- My real name is Winiewitsky.
- Winiewi- What?

280
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,953
My father changed it to Winters.

281
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,316
He couldn't speak English,
but he could dig more coal than two men.

282
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,996
- He could, eh?
- He was killed over there in Shaft 15.

283
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,629
Oh. Sure had me
skippin' rope tonight.

284
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,032
I thought you were the royal magoo.
Now you turn out to be just a hunky.

285
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:15,476
- Is that against me?
- No, you can't help it.

286
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,917
Oh, yes, I can help it. I never meant
to go near a coal mine again.

287
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,788
Only tonight,
seeing that cave-in, I-

288
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,838
They say coal means
warmth and life.

289
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,390
All it means to people like us
is death if you stay around it long enough.

290
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,710
- I'm after something better.
- So you tie yourself...

291
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,711
- to a cheap four-flusher.
- Not for long.

292
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,952
- Aimin' for the moon, eh?
- Yeah! If you're gonna shoot
for something, shoot big.

293
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,875
- Well, I ain't so little.
- What I said about coal
goes for the miners too.

294
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,157
- I ain't always gonna be slingin' a pick.
- What else can ya do?

295
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,277
I don't know yet.
But there ain't a thing I can't do...

296
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,955
- once I set my mind to it.
- The way you said that
I could almost believe you.

297
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,600
You're gonna hear a lot
about Pittsburgh Markham.

298
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,638
You're gonna remember
the night I told you that.

299
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,836
You're gonna
remember tonight.

300
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,672
I'm your kind of a guy, see?
And you're my kinda gal.

301
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,072
- We were cut from the same chunk.
- Yeah, of dirt and smoke.

302
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:18,109
And sweat, hunger and strikes.
And a life as black as one of those mines.

303
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,509
That's all I've known
since the day I was born.

304
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,592
Maybe that's what you want,
but I've got other plans.

305
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,111
Want me to drive
you back to town?

306
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,794
Not if I have to go through that
routine with you.

307
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,792
If Pittsburgh couldn't get to first base,
I'll wrap up the bats.

308
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,235
<i>Let's go.</i>

309
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,677
You know, Pitt, this is the first time
I ever saw you fan out.

310
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,191
I took her to the station.
She wasn't sure whether she'd
go to Philadelphia or New York.

311
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:01,511
- I said goodbye for ya.
- That was nice of ya.

312
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,160
- Where you been goin' nights?
- Over to Doc's.

313
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,196
- You're givin' me the runaround.
- Ahh-

314
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,794
- You haven't been goin'
over to Doc's every night.
- I sure have.

315
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,156
I've been gettin' a load
of that coal tar stuff.

316
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,516
- Guess I better visit Doc too.
- What for?

317
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,309
I, uh, I always say "hello" for ya.

318
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,358
You sure been takin' care
of my hellos and goodbyes.

319
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:26,752
Ah, you'd do the same for me, pal,
wouldn't ya? Or would ya?

320
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,950
<i>I brought this over</i>
<i>to liven things up.</i>

321
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,918
<i>Oh, that's very</i>
<i>thoughtful of you.</i>

322
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,230
I feel like getting up
and shaking a leg.

323
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,595
You haven't seen Pittsburgh
around tonight, have you?

324
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,955
<i>No, I guess</i>
<i>he must be at Barney's.</i>

325
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,112
- What's Barney's got
that's so wonderful?
- Red-eye.

326
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,034
I sure have been fooling Pitt about Josie.
How long do you think I can keep it up?

327
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,838
Not for long, I'm afraid.

328
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,471
- Well all's fair in love and war.
- You said it, Doc!

329
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:58,155
Hello, Countess.

330
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,357
<i>You should've come through the door.</i>
<i>It's much easier.</i>

331
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,271
I was afraid you'd drop in,
but not so hard.

332
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,955
What's the idea of lyin' to me,
your best friend?

333
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,600
So this is Philadelphia,
or was it New York you were going to?

334
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:13,514
<i>- This backbiter couldn't</i>
<i>decide where you went.</i>
- What if I changed my mind?

335
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,229
- Who sent for you?
- My conscience.

336
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,790
- I knew you'd want to see me again,
so here I am.

337
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,350
Fellas like you will make me
change my phone number.

338
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,429
Why don't you run along?
You're wasting your time.

339
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,431
Wasting my time!

340
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,195
You should've heard that hyena
tryin' to keep me away from you.

341
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,034
- Too bad he didn't succeed.
- Come on, get down off your stilts.

342
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,715
You got black dust in your veins,
same as I have.

343
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:46,112
Yeah, but I haven't got it
under my fingernails.

344
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,910
I don't know why I take it from you.
I usually kiss 'em goodbye
and leave 'em crying.

345
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,118
I want to tell you something.
After the other night,
I woke up thinking about you.

346
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,512
- And a week later, I was still doing it.
- No law against a miner thinking.

347
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,149
And I'm the thinkin'-est
miner you ever met.

348
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,438
Those big ideas I was tellin' you about?
I been workin' on 'em.

349
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,637
Since you made a confession,
I'm going to make one.

350
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,676
Yeah?

351
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:17,356
- I did want to see you again, Pittsburgh.
- You did?

352
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,353
- But now that I've seen you,
I'm disappointed.
- Wait a minute. Why?

353
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,000
Because you talk like all the rest
of the coal miners.

354
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,072
When they get up in the fresh air,
it makes them dizzy.

355
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,948
Hold on a minute. I'm not just talkin'.
I'm really gonna do somethin'.

356
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,951
- When?
- Oh, one of these days.

357
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,110
Write me a letter
because I won't be around.

358
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,830
I'm through diggin' coals.
But I can't go out and set the
world on fire tonight, can I?

359
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:42,434
- You could start tonight.
- How?

360
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:44,795
You're asking me, big shot?

361
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,677
Why don't you give up, Pitt?

362
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:50,673
- Can I use your phone, Doc?
- Why not?

363
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,755
Hello?

364
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,152
Is this the foreman of Shaft Number 7?
Well, Pittsburgh Markham
wants to quit his job.

365
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,549
She's crazy!

366
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,235
Sorry to have bothered you.
I guess I'm crazy.

367
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,677
Don't hang up. You're not so crazy.

368
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,593
I am quitting,
and I'm not drunk, Kelly.

369
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,875
<i>Sure, this is Pittsburgh Markham.</i>

370
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,111
Me and Cash Evans
won't be workin' for ya any more.

371
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,873
- That's my job you're talkin' about!
- And tell Wilson...

372
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,157
I'm gonna buy that mine from him
one of these days.

373
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,437
- So are you, Kelly!
- For me it goes double.

374
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,272
You boys may be needing those jobs.

375
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,273
- Yeah, what're we gonna buy beans with?
- Beans are out. From now on...

376
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,477
<i>it's fancy roast chicken</i>
<i>and French champagne.</i>

377
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,913
<i>I've got an idea</i>
<i>that's worth a million dollars.</i>

378
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,679
- Uh, good morning.
- Good morning.

379
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,558
- This is for Mr. Prentiss.
- Leave it on the desk.

380
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:56,279
Well, uh-

381
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,591
But the party
who sent it expects an answer.

382
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,069
Well, wait here, please.

383
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,914
- Mr. Prentiss.
- For me?

384
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,278
- The men who brought it said
an answer is expected.
- Hm. This must be for you.

385
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,352
Well, what
in the world-

386
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:19,557
Oh, no. I rather think this is for you.

387
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,234
What sort of nonsense is this?

388
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,154
"How would you like coke
of this quality at $3 a ton less...

389
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,071
<i>than you can make your own?"</i>

390
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,230
<i>- That's a good proposition.</i>
- Very good.

391
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,629
- Maybe you'd better show them in.
- Yes, sir.

392
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,395
A friend of mine once refused
to see a young man named Henry Ford.

393
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,598
<i>Mind if I stay, Father? I'm rather</i>
<i>interested in men with ideas like this.</i>

394
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,513
Mr. Prentiss wishes to see you.

395
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,992
- Mr. Prentiss.
<i>- Gentlemen.</i>

396
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,719
- I'm Pittsburgh Markham.
This is Cash Evans.
- How do you do, sir?

397
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,712
<i>- How do you do? This is my daughter.</i>
- How do you do?

398
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,837
- Glad to know you, Miss Prentiss.
- What's your proposition?

399
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,990
Go ahead and tell him, Cash.

400
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,550
<i>Your company is the biggest</i>
<i>consumer of coke in Pennsylvania.</i>

401
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,791
You've been buying coal, paying freight
and coking at your plant.

402
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,317
If we coke at the mines,
we can get it to you $3 a ton cheaper...

403
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,119
than you're getting it now.

404
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,998
It'll make a lot of difference
at the end of a month.

405
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:21,153
Then how about a contract to furnish
your next year's supply of coke?

406
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,993
Can you keep
those furnaces going?

407
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,675
- Well, uh-
- Sure, we can keep 'em going.

408
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,435
<i>Well, we can talk business.</i>
<i>What's the output of your mine?</i>

409
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,353
- We haven't got one right now.
- You contract your coal.

410
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,399
- What's the size of
your coking equipment?
- We haven't any equipment.

411
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,359
You come here without a mine,
no equipment and expect me
to give you a contract?

412
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,036
If you'd give us the contract first,
we could get credit to set up the ovens.

413
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,352
We'll put what we know about the coke
and coal business up against anybody.

414
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,398
I'll be very glad to sign
a contract with you...

415
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,438
providing you bring me proof
that you have the coal...

416
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,431
<i>the equipment</i>
<i>and the ability to deliver.</i>

417
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,114
Roughly, that would
require a backing of...

418
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,589
oh, about a quarter
of a million dollars.

419
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,194
Quarter of a million dollars?

420
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:13,239
Well, I'm surprised that should
present a problem to you, Mr. Markham.

421
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:17,359
- Come on, Pitt.
- Wait a minute. How long
are ya gonna be here?

422
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,911
- 'Til about 6.00.
- I'll be back at 5.00.

423
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,195
Come on, Cash.

424
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,509
What're ya up to?

425
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,989
Where'd you get that?

426
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,878
Prentiss sure doesn't
bother to dot his "I".

427
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,951
<i>"Morgan Prentiss."</i>

428
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,157
What're you gonna do, Pitt?
Forge a cheque?

429
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,198
Why, I wouldn't do
a thing like that.

430
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,477
I was just gonna sign his name
to a contract that says we have a deal...

431
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,393
to deliver coke to
Prentiss Steel Company.

432
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:56,234
Then I suppose you're going to the colliery
and flash it in front of Wilson...

433
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,880
and bamboozle him into furnishing
the cash and equipment?

434
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,316
No, I was gonna take it to the bank.
But your idea's better.

435
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,029
And to cinch it, I'll give him 50 percent.
Well, maybe only 40.

436
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,715
There's no tellin' where this'll end.
It'll run into the thousands,
maybe millions.

437
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,791
<i>We'll be rollin' in dough!</i>

438
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,156
Would you gentlemen roll me $4
on last week's rent?

439
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,196
Pay her off.

440
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,795
<i>Cash, you wouldn't object to</i>
<i>a few thousand bucks, would ya?</i>

441
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,509
I wouldn't object to just four.

442
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,637
Two's all I can spare,
Mrs. Higgins.

443
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,032
You millionaires oughtn't to
have any trouble digging up
the other $2 by tonight.

444
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:37,069
Two bucks! Why, we'll be smoking
$2 cigars before long.

445
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,357
Maybe you will.
Count me out, Pitt.

446
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,115
What's the matter with you?
Wanna be a hunky all your life?

447
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,316
I just don't like it.

448
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,951
Maybe you're afraid.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

449
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:54,874
If you weren't so selfish,
you'd think what it'll mean to others.

450
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,033
What about the guys we'd be giving jobs
to, and paying a living wage for a change?

451
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,669
Free hospitalization if they're sick.
Won't cost 'em a dime.

452
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,752
Look, Cash, you know
what this money can mean to us?

453
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,070
Doc Powers can have a new lab.

454
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:12,278
A place to develop all those drugs
and things he's been workin' on.

455
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,237
What do ya say?

456
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,833
Where ya goin'?

457
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,559
I said, where ya goin'?

458
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,517
With you.

459
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,639
I love ya, Cash.

460
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,599
- So help me, Hannah, I love ya.
- Sing Sing, here we come.

461
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,431
<i>Hey, Doc, where are ya?</i>

462
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,195
We did it, Doc. We put 'er over.
Show him the contract, Cash.

463
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,475
Get an eyeful, Doc.
Signed, sealed and delivered.

464
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:51,791
Boys, I can't tell you
how happy I am for you.

465
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,519
What we told you
about the new lab goes.

466
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,194
You and Junior will have a joint so big,
you'll have to have a guide.

467
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:00,590
Bust open this bottle, Cash.
The fireworks is gonna start right here.

468
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:03,638
And finish in the biggest nightclub
in town. You're going along, Doc.

469
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,870
- Who, me?
- Yeah, wheelchair and all.

470
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,919
Gonna get all those chorus cuties
to autograph that plaster shank of yours.

471
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,312
- Where's Hunky? Isn't she here yet?
- No, I don't think she's coming.

472
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,198
- Not coming?
- Why not?

473
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,431
That's something
you'll have to find out yourself.

474
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,672
You bet I will. I'll go get her.
I'll be right back.

475
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,389
We put it over, Hunky. Prentiss gave us
the green light to go ahead.

476
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,835
- Where do you think you're going?
- Oh, I don't know.

477
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,992
- New York, Philadelphia, Chicago-
- Wait a minute.

478
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,992
You're part of this outfit.
We're partners.

479
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,196
And we've got the brass ring
right in our hand.

480
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,876
There are no brass rings. I know,
I've been on too many merry-go-rounds.

481
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,997
Believe me, I've tried to catch them.
There just aren't any.

482
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,232
There are on this one, Countess.
I tell ya, we're on our way up.

483
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,278
And we're goin' up together,
you and me.

484
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,955
<i>Why, I'd still be diggin' coal</i>
<i>if you hadn't sunk the spurs into me.</i>

485
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:03,919
I need you.
I'm crazy about you.

486
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,036
I've heard that before too.

487
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,113
From now on we're gonna be together,
no matter what.

488
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:12,634
No matter what.

489
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,116
<i>It was wasn't easy,</i>
<i>those first days.</i>

490
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,715
<i>But you both rolled up your sleeves</i>
<i>and went to work like two demons.</i>

491
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:30,112
<i>You boys nursed those coke ovens</i>
<i>as though they were</i>
<i>newborn babes with the colic.</i>

492
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,239
<i>And you went to bed at night</i>
<i>proud in knowing that you'd</i>
<i>done an honest day's work.</i>

493
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,677
<i>Markham & Evans looked pretty good</i>
<i>when those wagons started</i>
<i>rolling to the steel mill.</i>

494
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,274
<i>Hard work meant</i>
<i>happiness and success.</i>

495
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,148
<i>And when you got your first cheque,</i>
<i>you didn't forget that</i>
<i>you were all three partners.</i>

496
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,552
<i>And now, instead of beans and red-eye,</i>
<i>it was champagne and fancy roast chicken.</i>

497
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:52,632
<i>Of course, Mrs. Higgins' rooming house</i>
<i>couldn't hold you now.</i>

498
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,632
<i>Josie picked out a new apartment</i>
<i>for you and Cash.</i>

499
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:59,395
<i>And I moved too, into that</i>
<i>new laboratory you boys promised me.</i>

500
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,596
<i>The company</i>
<i>couldn't stop growing.</i>

501
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,797
<i>And you did that on only</i>
<i>50 percent of the profits...</i>

502
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,952
<i>for old Wilson at the colliery</i>
<i>was holding you to a strict accounting.</i>

503
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:11,032
<i>Success like that was bound</i>
<i>to make changes in all of us.</i>

504
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,271
<i>But the greatest change</i>
<i>was in you, Pittsburgh.</i>

505
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,191
- Good morning, Miss Fordham.
- Good morning, Mr. Markham.

506
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,511
- Mr. Milgrane is waiting to see you.
- Who?

507
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,036
- Mr. Milgrane.
- Oh, come on in, boys.

508
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:27,193
- Good morning, Mr. Prentiss.
Did I keep you waiting?
- Yes, you did.

509
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,795
I don't want any third
assistants working on my duds.
Are you Migraine himself?

510
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,395
The name is Milgrane, Mr. Markham.
Milgrane and Milgrane.

511
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:36,436
I'm both of them. Carlos.

512
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,511
These aren't the terms
we agreed on.

513
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:42,798
Our understanding was that I could renew
at the same figure.

514
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,555
- You can.
- The latest imported worsteds.
Very smart this season.

515
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,315
- But I've already talked with Wilson.
<i>- I've got to see him!</i>

516
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,279
- It's important!
- Wilson said you had no right
to make a proposition like that.

517
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:58,239
And he hasn't! I invested a great deal
of capital in this venture.

518
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,632
I'm entitled to a fair return. The price is up
to you and all the other companies.

519
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,473
Wilson, you've already made more money
than you ever made before.

520
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:09,553
- It's still cheaper than
coking your own coal.
- I won't be held up!

521
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:13,189
Don't waste your breath
on this two-bit chiseller, Prentiss.
Our deal sticks.

522
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,795
- Make me up six of these
in assorted colors.
- Nice and conservative.

523
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,078
- Not too bright.
- You shouldn't say things
like that about Mr. Wilson.

524
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:25,438
- The price is up to all other
companies, but not to you.
- I don't understand.

525
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:30,275
- Your daughter can explain it.
<i>- You haven't the power</i>
<i>to grant special favors.</i>

526
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,033
For two cents, I'd squeeze you
out of this company!

527
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,874
You're a little late for that
because you're already squoze.
Or is it squeezed?

528
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,598
<i>- Anyway, you're out.</i>
- What?

529
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,955
You were so busy counting your profits,
you didn't bother to find out...

530
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,837
who owns all the shares you issued.

531
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:46,276
I started buying 'em up
the day we went into business.

532
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,237
An aspirin, Mr. Wilson?

533
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,552
You can't do this to me!
I'll see about this!

534
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,269
How about a $2 cigar, Prentiss?

535
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,710
Mr. Markham, please.
Miss Winters calling.

536
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,109
Hello, Hunky, how's tricks?

537
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,239
Hello, Pitt. You haven't
forgotten about tonight?

538
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:15,916
Doc Powers is going to be at my apartment
and he wants you to be there.
It's very important.

539
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,116
Well, uh...

540
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,795
all right, if it's important,
but I may be a little late.

541
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,270
- All right, goodbye, dear.
- What did he say?

542
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:28,079
He's coming, but he said
he might be late. Little business.

543
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,754
What little business?

544
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,876
He didn't say.

545
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,629
- 'Night. Pittsburgh doesn't know
what he missed, the big lug.
- Goodnight.

546
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,190
I'm sorry to hurry along,
but I've some work to
finish at the laboratory.

547
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,637
- I hope it's a success.
- Any problem can be
solved with patience.

548
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,551
<i>Goodnight.</i>

549
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,758
- Pour me a drink, will you, Cash?
- So soon after dinner?

550
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,593
I feel like it.
And anyway, I'm a hunky.

551
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,478
Hunkies are supposed to have
stomachs lined with slag...

552
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,869
and hearts of anthracite.

553
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:13,077
I doubt that.

554
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:16,948
You might feel better, Josie,
if you let your hair down.

555
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,238
I might not be able to get it
pinned up again. Let's leave it.

556
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,312
Pitt's all right. This success
he's having now has perhaps...

557
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,073
<i>- gone to his head, but-</i>
- Pour me a drink.

558
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,749
I want to get out of here.
Would you take me out, Cash?

559
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:38,038
- Sure.
- I want to go to
the biggest speakeasy in town.

560
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,076
I've got a new dress.

561
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,312
The one I'd made for last new year's eve,
and then Pitt had to go to Harrisburg.

562
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,391
Never worn it.

563
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,916
I want to get all dressed up.
I want to have a good time.

564
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,911
And I want to
drink and dance!

565
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,719
We're dressed up, we're dancing-

566
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,758
Having a good time.

567
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,198
And the drinks are on the table.

568
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,876
Cash Evans special, Mr. Evans.
Only one permitted to a customer.

569
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,758
Now, just what kind of a something
is a Cash Evans special?

570
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,479
Long, strong and sneaky...

571
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,120
but tastes as innocent as a milkshake.

572
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,159
One part Demera rum,
two parts gold rum, one part light rum...

573
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,800
One lime juice
and with a dash of absinthe.

574
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,633
Cool gently with a blowtorch
and you're ready for danger.

575
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,632
Sounds like the sort of a drink
that can stand up and walk around.

576
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,473
Here's looking at you while I still can.

577
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:45,230
- Only one Cash Evans special
to a customer, Mr. Evans.
- You can't even feel 'em.

578
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:48,915
I hear you can't feel anything
when Jack Dempsey hits you, either.

579
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,357
It gives you that restless feeling. Makes
you want to keep traveling for a refill.

580
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:58,116
Mm-hmm. I think I'll put a cap
on this and send it out to get some more.

581
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,829
I bet over at Barney's
they serve three to a customer.

582
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,230
Hold still!

583
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,959
Only one pitcher of Cash Evans special
to a customer.

584
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,112
- Ah, it's nice to see you two again.
- Thanks, Barney.

585
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:16,159
We always used to have
a lot of fun here.

586
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,916
When you and Pitt got your first cheque,
this is where we celebrated, remember?

587
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,788
I remember. Excuse me.

588
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,155
- That's all right, Barney.
- Sure.

589
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,118
And they played that same song too.

590
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,754
Do you see who I think I see?

591
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,796
How quaint!

592
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,993
- Well, well! Long time,
no see, Pittsburgh.
- Hello, Barney.

593
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:52,596
- We're slumming tonight.
- Sure, heh-heh! Same old Pitt.
You've come to the right place.

594
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,911
<i>- Got a table for us?</i>
<i>- Sure. Over here. Heh!</i>

595
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,072
Some friends of yours are here.
Maybe you'd like to sit with them.

596
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,914
- Yeah, who's that?
- Cash and Josie.

597
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,151
<i>- The tired businessman!</i>
- I beg your pardon.

598
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,028
Isn't your name Markham,
of the monkey business Markhams?

599
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,476
<i>- Would you like to sit here?</i>
- Why, uh-

600
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,835
Of course, sit down.

601
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,151
Miss Prentiss, Miss Winters.

602
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,518
- How do you do?
- Oh, very nicely, thank you.

603
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,433
Now, Pitt didn't introduce me properly.

604
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,433
I'm really the former Countess Winiewitsky
of the Polish nobility.

605
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:32,875
Our estates are completely underground.

606
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,953
- How very amusing.
- Very. Have you ever been down
in a mine tunnel?

607
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,272
- Why, no, I haven't.
- Oh, you must come down
sometime and meet the boys.

608
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,794
<i>Or do you like them better</i>
<i>out of the shaft?</i>

609
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,190
Uh, would you care
to finish this dance?

610
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,398
I'd love to. Would you order me a drink,
please, Charles? Something mild.

611
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,753
- Small world, isn't it?
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

612
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,149
Small world, small people.

613
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,550
Is that the little business you were
giving me the business about?

614
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:06,350
That's big business. I've been doing us
a lot of good through Prentiss
and his daughter.

615
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,113
You make it sound so clear
when you say it that way.

616
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,192
Hey, you know me, Josie.
Business before pleasure.

617
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:16,068
Say, you're a little splashed up tonight,
aren't you?

618
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,469
What did you expect?

619
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,074
Find me waiting at the telephone,
holding my breath?

620
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,709
No, but I expected you to grow up
in the head along
with your other improvements.

621
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,998
Waiting for the latest bulletins
about big shot Markham.

622
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,514
Oh, skip it.

623
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,070
Was there anything really important
that you and Doc
wanted to see me about tonight?

624
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:39,153
No, we were just going
to celebrate something.

625
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,515
It was a mistake in the first place.

626
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,591
<i>What's that?</i>

627
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:45,796
Your birthday.

628
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,711
Oh.

629
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,748
- Here's your usual, Pittsburgh.
- Bring the lady something mild.

630
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,149
Oh, maybe she'd like some punch, no?

631
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,800
Well, yes, I would like some.

632
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,318
<i>Thank you.</i>

633
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:14,392
Ooh, that's delightful. What is it?

634
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,519
Oh, just a little moonlight and rose thorns.
Harmless as molasses taffy.

635
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:22,434
- Shall we be going, Josie?
- Going, going, gone.

636
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,318
- Goodnight.
<i>- Goodnight, Barney.</i>

637
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:28,198
<i>- Goodbye, Miss Prentiss.</i>
<i>So long, Pitt.</i>
<i>- Goodnight.</i>

638
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,748
<i>- So long, Barney.</i>
<i>- So long, Cash.</i>

639
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,912
One pitcher to a customer.

640
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:41,118
- Keep your chin up.
- Yes, up and out where it can be hit.

641
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,796
If anybody hit that chin of yours,
you'd break his hand.
You're no china doll.

642
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:49,793
I was so crazy,
blindly in love with him.

643
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:53,316
You know, Cash,
he's great in his way.

644
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,598
He can do anything
he sets his mind to.

645
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,151
But he's no good now.
No good for anybody.

646
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,236
Well, who let you in?

647
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,278
That fancy pants with an accent
you call a butler.

648
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,477
- I just dropped around
to tell you something.
- Yeah? What?

649
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,028
Your two-timing finally
caught up with you.

650
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:24,749
- You mean about tonight?
That was nothing.
- Wasn't it? You're through.

651
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:27,912
- You're washed up.
- You seem awfully happy about it.

652
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,468
I am. You had your chance
and made a mess of it.

653
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,471
Now here's where I step in.

654
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,518
You always did have an eye
for Josie, didn't you?

655
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:39,275
What're you tryin' to do?
Catch her on the rebound?

656
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,351
Something like that.

657
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,910
You don't care for her any more
than you do for that $2 cigar.

658
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,797
But I do.

659
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,838
- Got it all figured out, haven't you?
- Sure.

660
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,117
Then why tell me about it?

661
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,478
I don't know why, but for some
cockeyed reason she still thinks
that she's in love with you.

662
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:00,836
But if she'll have me, I'm just
crazy enough to marry her anyway.

663
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,480
You're thinking, "Shall I step aside
and give him a chance?

664
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:07,997
Or shall I run to her and show him
that the great Pittsburgh
is still the head man?"

665
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,595
You think you can take her away
from me any time you want to.

666
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:16,276
If you snap your fingers, she'll run
right into your arms. Turn around.

667
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:24,199
From now on, keep that charm
under lock and key.

668
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,999
You'll do that, won't you, Pitt?

669
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,748
What are you laughing about?

670
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,071
Read the morning paper.

671
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,597
<i>Coal marries steel.</i>
<i>You were climbing up</i>
<i>in the world, Pittsburgh.</i>

672
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,673
<i>But if you'd hit Josie between</i>
<i>the eyes with your fist, you</i>
<i>couldn't have hurt her worse.</i>

673
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:55,230
<i>Naturally, it was too much to expect</i>
<i>that she would be at your wedding.</i>

674
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,551
<i>It was the biggest wedding we'd</i>
<i>seen around here in a long time.</i>

675
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,235
<i>Then do you remember at your</i>
<i>wedding reception afterward, Pittsburgh?</i>

676
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,596
- Charles, I want you to meet
Mr. Symonds and Mr. Channing.
- It's a great pleasure.

677
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,069
- How do you do?
- They're on the board of Prentiss Steel.

678
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,230
Prentiss was just
talking about you.

679
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,356
That's a father-in-law's privilege.

680
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:16,228
As your wedding present, I just
suggested that the board appoint
you to a vice-presidency...

681
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,470
<i>of the Prentiss Steel Company.</i>

682
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,120
Well, that'll suit me fine,
temporarily.

683
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,670
- Are you a devotee
of the opera, Mr. Markham?
- I beg your pardon?

684
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,718
Are you a devotee
of the opera, Mr. Markham?

685
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:33,677
Oh, uh, yes, indeed.

686
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:38,072
Oh, I think I see Mr. Evans leaving.
Excuse us, please.

687
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,912
- Well, goodnight, Mr. Prentiss.
- Goodnight.

688
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,037
- Cash, you're not leaving?
- I'm afraid so. Sorry I have to go.

689
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,078
I had a wonderful time. I want to
wish you both a great deal of happiness.

690
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,991
- Thank you, Cash.
- Goodnight. Goodnight, Pitt.

691
00:46:48,080 --> 00:46:51,197
Cash! Excuse me.
You don't have to go yet.

692
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,191
I've been trying
to get you alone.

693
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,909
- I'm sorry I blew my topper
the night I barged in on ya.
- Oh, that's all right.

694
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,468
Why didn't you tell me you were
gonna marry Shannon Prentiss?

695
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:02,916
- You know me. Never tip my
mitt 'til the deal's closed.
- Mm-hmm.

696
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,116
Stick around, will ya?
Don't leave me alone
with all these strangers.

697
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,637
- I don't speak their language.
- Sorry, Pitt, but this is what you wanted.

698
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,395
- And it looks like you got it.
- I know where there's
a nice quiet corner...

699
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,869
in this museum where we
can cut a few touches.

700
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:19,430
- You mean sit on the red plush
and talk about old times?
- Yeah!

701
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:22,159
No, thanks, brother.
Goodnight.

702
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,516
Hey, buddy.

703
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,998
- Hiya, Hunky.
- What are you doing here, Pittsburgh?

704
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,675
Got a little chilly uptown.
I thought I'd come down here
where it's warm.

705
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:59,639
- Aren't you gonna invite me in?
- Are you out of your senses?

706
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,952
When I look at you I am. You really are
a countess in that outfit. New?

707
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,838
What are you thinking of,
coming here tonight?

708
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:11,391
Oh, that gang'll never miss me.
Why didn't you come to my wedding?

709
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,870
<i>- You didn't even send a telegram.</i>
- Congratulations.

710
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,758
I hope you'll both
be very happy.

711
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:20,513
Aw, you got it
all wrong, Hunky.

712
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,797
Marriage with that crowd is a business,
like everything else.

713
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,838
I played my angles right
and made a solid deal.

714
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,115
But that's got nothin'
to do with you and me.

715
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,590
- You and me?
- Sure!

716
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,229
Pittsburgh, remember?
A big name for a big guy.

717
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:40,074
And I'm gonna be as
big as this town, like I said.

718
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,517
- And all because you got me started.
- You've done all right.

719
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,878
Oh, I'm not talkin' about money.
I'm talkin' about us, you and me.

720
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,748
We're still gonna see a lot
of each other, same as always.

721
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:56,355
- Take your hands down, Pitt.
- Oh, come on, Hunky.
You got the wrong slant.

722
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:58,954
You gotta see this thing
the right way.

723
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,158
For the first time,
I do see it the right way.

724
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,550
<i>Why did you come here?</i>

725
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,350
I'm not sure.
Guess I had the wrong slant.

726
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,079
You don't know me at all, do you?

727
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,232
Now I realize
you've never known me.

728
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,551
A few minutes ago I thought
I couldn't stand what you'd done.

729
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,191
Oh, I get all mixed up when you're
not around. I don't wanna lose you.

730
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,999
I need you.

731
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,310
You should've thought
of that before.

732
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,076
- Listen, Hunky-
- I've been around a long time, Pitt...

733
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,470
and in my stupid mind
there was never anybody else but you.

734
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,915
And you could've had me forever.

735
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:48,639
But now I'm glad
it has worked out the way it has.

736
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:53,157
You picked the kind of life you want.
So go back to it and to her...

737
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,630
and at least let me keep
a little respect for you.

738
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,790
Please go, Pitt.

739
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,275
Okay, Hunky.

740
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,708
<i>Maybe you were thinking</i>
<i>of those long days when you sweated...</i>

741
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:16,553
<i>for old Wilson in</i>
<i>Shaft Number 7, Pittsburgh.</i>

742
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:20,758
<i>Now you own that very mine.</i>
<i>It gave you a feeling of triumph.</i>

743
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,753
<i>The name "Markham and Evans"</i>
<i>began spreading out over</i>
<i>the city like a circus tent.</i>

744
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,831
<i>It became a household word.</i>

745
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,514
<i>Coal, coal tar</i>
<i>and its by-products:</i>

746
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:33,115
<i>dyes, paints, asphalts,</i>
<i>varnishes, roof coverings.</i>

747
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,590
<i>You made coal pay, Pittsburgh.</i>
<i>You were in the driver's seat.</i>

748
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,831
<i>And coal to you meant dollars</i>
<i>and dollars meant power.</i>

749
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:43,549
<i>Enough power to take the leadership of</i>
<i>Prentiss Steel away from Morgan Prentiss.</i>

750
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,553
<i>How you chuckled at</i>
<i>the stockholders' meeting when</i>
<i>they announced you were elected.</i>

751
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,790
<i>You made another enemy</i>
<i>that day, Pittsburgh.</i>

752
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:52,633
<i>While to Cash Evans, it meant</i>
<i>something else than money:</i>

753
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,678
<i>how could it best serve</i>
<i>the people who depended upon it?</i>

754
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,910
<i>And somewhere in the parade</i>
<i>of years, Pittsburgh...</i>

755
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,470
<i>you'd forgotten a promise you made</i>
<i>to Cash and Joe Malneck and his friends.</i>

756
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:06,396
- Come on out!
- We wanna talk to ya!

757
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,950
- Take it easy, boys, take it easy.
- Take it easy?

758
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,190
- Be yourself. This is me, remember?
- I remember.

759
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,432
- I'm not so sure you and Pittsburgh do.
- I oughta bust you in
the nose for that crack.

760
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,990
Listen, men. I know what Pittsburgh
promised you, and he meant every word.

761
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,753
More gab. What about
the new safety shafts?

762
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,638
What about the higher wages
we're supposed to get?

763
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,518
All's we get is gab, gab, gab!

764
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,831
Now wait a minute!
Our companies have grown fast.
It takes money to expand.

765
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:36,118
It takes money for these men to live too.

766
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,112
Wait. I'll give you my word.
At the end of the quarter...

767
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,760
Joe and anybody else you guys name
can examine the books.

768
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:43,956
If Pittsburgh is making money,
you'll get your share.

769
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,793
- Is that fair enough?
- What do we know about books?

770
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,118
All right, men.
We'll let it ride this time.

771
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,510
Go back to work.

772
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,353
Keep your eyes open, Joe.

773
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:02,398
Those boys are tired
of stalling, Cash.

774
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,756
You stuck your neck out this time.
I hope you don't get it chopped off.

775
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:08,638
- Thanks, Joe. Have a cigarette.
- Sure.

776
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,359
I don't care what ya promised.
I don't show my books to anybody.

777
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,477
I gave the men my word,
and you're gonna back me up.

778
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,120
- Am I?
- What about the hospitalization
you promised?

779
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,668
- The schools you were going to build?
- Schools?

780
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:24,709
- And make 'em as smart as me?
- Sometimes I wonder if you're
smart or just plain lucky.

781
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,553
You're heading for trouble
if you don't change your thinking.

782
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,153
My thinking's all right.

783
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,789
My partnership in this outfit
gives me some right to say what's done...

784
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,350
so I'm gonna keep my promise
to Joe Malneck.

785
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,638
Hold on, ya hothead!
We're pals, Cash, remember?

786
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:43,109
- Do you?
- All right, you win.

787
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,556
If it means that much to ya,
I'll put the books on display
at the public library.

788
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,679
How's that?
I'm a rat, Cash.

789
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,593
That's why I gotta have you around,
sorta keep me in line.

790
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,716
Get a sharper knife.
You could slice it thinner.

791
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,349
- I love ya, Cash. So help me, I love ya.
- Yeah.

792
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:03,035
Say, don't forget that party tonight.
You haven't been around in a long while.

793
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,588
You oughta mix with
the big boys more. It pays off.

794
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,716
You should know.

795
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,190
By the way, uh,
why don't you bring Josie?

796
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,635
I haven't seen her in a long while.

797
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,430
Maybe I will. It might amuse her
to see that mausoleum you live in.

798
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,114
You two set the date yet?

799
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,351
You'll know it when we do.
Is it bothering you, Pitt?

800
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,029
- Nice to be dancing with the host.
- Hmm?

801
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:44,078
Or am I dancing alone? You're doing
the steps all right, Charles...

802
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,469
but your mind seems to be elsewhere.

803
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:50,473
I can't understand what's happened
to Cash. He's usually right on time.

804
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,519
- I'm worried about him.
- You're not worried
about Miss Winters, are you?

805
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:03,398
Well, your worries are over.

806
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:13,274
<i>- Hello, Josie, Cash!</i>
- Mrs. Markham, Pitt.

807
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,511
- Say, Josie, you look like
a real countess tonight.
- Thank you.

808
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,149
- We're sorry we're late, Mrs. Markham.
- Oh, that's all right.

809
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:22,515
- Hello, Cash.
- How are you, Cash?
- Glad to see you, Cash.

810
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,431
- Hello.
- You haven't been getting
around much lately.

811
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,990
- I wouldn't say that.
- Oh, Miss Winters. Mr. Cooper,
Mr. Wilcox, Mr. Drake.

812
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,752
- How do you do?
- May I have this dance?

813
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:32,752
- Not with him!
- Nor with him! With me.

814
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,355
- It's a host's prerogative.
- Excuse me.

815
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,829
Prerogative! I wonder if he
knows what it means?

816
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:41,992
- You know, I just realized what's
been wrong with these parties.
- What?

817
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,753
You. Ya liven 'em up.

818
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,559
It's like a Christmas tree.
It's dead 'til you turn on the lights.

819
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:50,996
- Thank you.
- I really missed you, Josie.

820
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:54,789
Dancing with you again, it's-
it's like old times.

821
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:59,198
Old times are old times, Pitt.

822
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:05,958
What's the matter? You afraid?

823
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:09,589
You're the same old Pittsburgh.
But I'm not the same Josie.

824
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,110
- Miss Winters, it was my dance.
- How about me, Miss Winters?

825
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:19,634
Sorry, boys. She's gonna dance
with the guy what brung her.

826
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:21,870
Bulls and bears of Wall Street
are nothing...

827
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:23,951
compared to the wolves
of the steel industry.

828
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,231
Shall we finish
our dance, Charles?

829
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,231
With pleasure, Mrs. Markham.

830
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:47,510
I've never had
a better time in my life.

831
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:50,398
Naturally. You were out
with an old swell-time expert.

832
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,472
Never had any complaints yet
from the female clientele.

833
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,156
The first good time
I've had in a month of Sundays.

834
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,993
And I always
remember firsts.

835
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,992
Like the first time
I rode on a streetcar.

836
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:06,719
- Or ate an ice-cream cone.
- Or the first long dress you wore.

837
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,236
Mm-hmm. Don't you ever remember
the first good times in your life?

838
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:14,950
Mm-hmm. My first long pants were
too tight and my first pay cheque too little.

839
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:18,874
The trouble with you, Josie,
you've been too nearsighted to
see the good times around you.

840
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:21,554
- Too much Pittsburgh smoke.
- Yes.

841
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,029
But now the atmosphere
is getting pretty clear, Cash.

842
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,954
Well, it's about time.

843
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,589
I never could understand
what you saw in that big lug anyway.

844
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:38,151
Why, I used to beat him
at everything from pool to poker.

845
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,357
I could dig more coal in two hours
than he could in two days.

846
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:44,352
I did all his talking for him,
and his fighting.

847
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,957
I used to lick him every once in a while
just for the exercise.

848
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:52,510
Take his dames away from him
just to prove that old stuff
about mind over matter.

849
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,830
And why did you stop
taking his dames?

850
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:59,357
I didn't. But when they were too dumb
to see straight, I wouldn't even bother.

851
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,228
But sometimes dumb girls get smart,
if you give them enough time.

852
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,880
<i>- I've been learning a lot.</i>
- For instance?

853
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,192
Oh, just that chinning yourself
on the moon isn't such a neat trick.

854
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:13,158
The man I want to marry must
have both feet on the ground.

855
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,071
About, uh, size 12?

856
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,789
Maybe.

857
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:22,189
I'm just an easygoing,
calculating guy.

858
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:26,114
But, sister, when I finally call 'em,
they drop right in the pot.

859
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:30,193
What if this bird you've been
talking about doesn't even ask you?

860
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,796
I hope he will.

861
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:39,472
He will. I'm sure he will, Josie.

862
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,473
The way you behaved.
I've never seen anything
so ridiculous in all my life.

863
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:45,994
- You and that woman.
- Oh, stop it, will ya, Shannon?

864
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,514
I understand, Charles.
You love her.

865
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:50,716
You always have
and you always will.

866
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,837
Can't I have a laugh with an old friend
without you gettin' green-eyed?

867
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,876
Look in the mirror.
If ever I saw...

868
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:59,157
- a short-fused dynamite
ready to explode-
- I want a divorce, Charles.

869
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:02,357
For what?
Because Hunky and I were dancing?

870
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:05,796
No. Because you're crude,
rude and a bore.

871
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,997
You always will be.
You've ruined my father's life...

872
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,878
- and now you're ruining mine.
- That's right, Shannon.

873
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,837
Then you'll
give me my freedom?

874
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:17,071
- No.
- But why do you insist on keeping me?

875
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,357
Is it because in me,
you have some alleged social standing?

876
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,034
- Or is it because you
and that hunky are after-
- Stop it!

877
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:26,112
That isn't true.
I know what you're thinking...

878
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,636
and I'm tempted to wring
your lovely little neck.

879
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:31,790
I'll let you go
when I'm ready.

880
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:34,831
I hate you.

881
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,876
Oh, you'll feel better
in the morning.

882
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:43,035
<i>It's not a fairy tale.</i>
<i>It's scientific history.</i>

883
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,680
<i>Breathtaking.</i>
<i>Taxing the imagination.</i>

884
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,309
<i>Out of coal tar came more than</i>
<i>200 different substances.</i>

885
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,119
Dyes, explosives, sulpha drugs.

886
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:55,397
These are the products that come
from a simple lump of coal.

887
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,630
Thousands of derivatives.

888
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:00,792
And here is the big factor I've been
telling you about. The sulpha compound.

889
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:03,235
Big? Why, the word
isn't big enough to describe it.

890
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,959
What Doc's been telling us
is so big it makes your head swim.

891
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,031
<i>Did I hear somebody</i>
<i>say "big"?</i>

892
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,031
Brethren, you're
speaking my language.

893
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,509
I'm sure were are, Pitt.
That's why you're going to be...

894
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,309
one of the main contributors
to the greatest gift man has
received in modern times.

895
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,914
Is that so?
What am I giving away?

896
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:20,831
If it works,
you'll be saving lives.

897
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,878
You'll be doing away
with a lot of suffering in this world.

898
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:26,110
Remember Doc told us
about a man who thought coal...

899
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:28,236
<i>was the basis</i>
<i>for a medical cure-all...</i>

900
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,754
and that scientists
have been trying to prove it ever since?

901
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:33,513
It looks like Doc
has finally found the trail.

902
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,431
I hope it's a short trail.
In my books...

903
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,910
every time the clock strikes
it oughta ring like a cash register.

904
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,798
- Go ahead, spill it, Doc.
- That's why we're here, Pitt.

905
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:45,475
Gonna take a lot of money
to carry on this research,
but we're close to the answer.

906
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,869
A sulpha-type compound
made of coal tar...

907
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,633
that would check certain
bacterial growth in body fluids...

908
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,154
and at the same time
be as harmless to take as water.

909
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:55,071
Hmm. Very interesting.

910
00:59:55,160 --> 00:59:57,435
Look, Doc, why don't you stick
to your paints and varnishes?

911
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,080
Let somebody else worry about
this sulpha whatever-it-is.

912
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,196
But this is something
that'll benefit all humanity.

913
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,748
Let's level on something that will benefit
Markham and Evans.

914
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,035
We're to drop our medical research
after all our work?

915
01:00:07,120 --> 01:00:10,112
Medicine isn't up our alley.
We're in the coal business and that's that.

916
01:00:10,200 --> 01:00:12,191
Wait a minute, Pitt.
If that's your verdict...

917
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:14,271
I'm getting out of the coal business.
Doc and I are leaving.

918
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:17,796
- Why don't you think it over, Pitt?
- His time's too valuable.

919
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,836
You can have my interest in
Markham and Evans at whatever it's worth.

920
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,639
It's a deal.
You can start packing.

921
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,030
- Grazlich, you're in charge from now on.
- I'm leaving too.

922
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:29,317
Pittsburgh, you're making
the greatest mistake of your life.

923
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,597
I doubt it, Hunky.
I probably made bigger mistakes.

924
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:35,831
- But I'll still do all right by myself.
<i>- By yourself's right.</i>

925
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,514
Just take the name "Evans" off of
Markham and Evans and that'll complete it.

926
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,672
With pleasure. And that
won't take very long.

927
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,997
- Oh, Mr. Markham?
- Yes?

928
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,389
Mr. Malneck and some
other gentlemen are here to see you.

929
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,836
- What do they want?
<i>- They didn't say.</i>

930
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,196
Oh, I remember.
Have 'em come in.

931
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,430
- Come in, gentlemen.
- Thank you.

932
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,109
Hello, boys. What's up?

933
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,589
- It's the end of the quarter, Pittsburgh.
- Yeah?

934
01:01:04,680 --> 01:01:06,875
We hadn't heard from you,
so we decided to drop around.

935
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,791
We come to look
at the books.

936
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:11,314
This is Mr. Smith and Mr. Carney,
the union bookkeepers.

937
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,311
So if you'll get hold
of your company accountant...

938
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,994
the sooner we get to work,
the sooner we'll know where we stand.

939
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:18,753
- I don't know what you're
talkin' about, Joe?
- What did I tell ya?

940
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,037
Wait a minute.
We had a promise that we could
look at the company books...

941
01:01:22,120 --> 01:01:23,997
<i>- the end of this quarter.</i>
- Did I give it to ya?

942
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,311
- No, but Cash did,
and he's your partner.
- He <i>was</i> my partner.

943
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:31,439
<i>Get this, Malneck. I'm running</i>
<i>this company now, my own way, see?</i>

944
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:35,399
That means nobody looks at the books
unless I say so, and I say no.

945
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,278
- Suppose we make you
let us look at the books?
- Go right ahead, Johnny.

946
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,828
- Well, we got ways of making you-
- Take it easy, Johnny.

947
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:43,832
If he won't let us see the books,
there's no law says he must.

948
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:47,674
It's only fair to tell you, Pittsburgh.
The men aren't gonna like this.

949
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,911
That gang of moles don't know
what they like. Now how 'bout
diggin' a little coal?

950
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,911
- I'll dig coal!
- Johnny, Johnny.

951
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:54,956
Come on, let's go.

952
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,910
I know you were
on the level, Cash.

953
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:05,798
I've been keeping the men quiet
only because of what you promised.

954
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:09,316
What I promised.
That's the tough part, Joe.

955
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,868
I should've known he'd cross you
the moment I left the company.

956
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:15,191
Labor will never forgive him for it,
even if nothing can be done about it.

957
01:02:15,280 --> 01:02:18,875
There's something I can do about it.
I'll be right with you, Joe.

958
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:20,951
- What are you going to do, Cash?
- Never mind, Josie.

959
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,235
Stay away from him.
You'll only make more trouble.

960
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,311
- She's right, Cash.
- Are you afraid he'll get hurt?

961
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,039
- No.
- I'll let you in on
a little secret, Josie.

962
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:32,033
That night I took you to Pittsburgh's party
I wanted us to prove something for keeps.

963
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:35,237
<i>I wanted to prove that you could look</i>
<i>Pittsburgh in the eye and laugh at him.</i>

964
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:38,551
That he could take you in his arms,
you could still laugh, and mean it.

965
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,838
We did prove it, didn't we?
What else can I do to make you believe it?

966
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,639
Stop worrying about what's
gonna happen to him now. Come on, Joe.

967
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:47,676
But it's you, Cash, not Pitt.

968
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,637
Cash! Oh.

969
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:53,471
You better stay here, Josie.

970
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,551
Oh, Doc, he doesn't understand.

971
01:02:57,080 --> 01:02:59,355
- Who was the message from?
- I don't know, Mr. Evans.

972
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:03,638
I know. It was from that crazy Johnny.
We'd better get over to the mine quick.

973
01:03:03,720 --> 01:03:05,950
First I heard of it.
If you think there's gonna be trouble...

974
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:09,350
- I'll call the shift off.
- And have 'em think I'm scared
to go down in my own mine?

975
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,635
- Number 7. I'll handle it.
- Maybe I better go with you.

976
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,755
- I hear there's trouble down below.
- I wouldn't know.

977
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,070
You wouldn't know,
or you wouldn't tell me?

978
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:33,194
I understand there's somebody down here
wearin' a chip with my name on it.

979
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:35,919
- Know anything about it?
- You better ask Johnny.

980
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,991
Johnny, huh?
Where is he?

981
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,991
Up ahead.

982
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:44,473
I warned him not to go down alone.
He's the boss.

983
01:03:44,560 --> 01:03:46,437
Johnny's bad medicine
with a pick in his hands.

984
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:49,830
- What's the matter with the
automatic? Won't it run?
- Yes, but it's not safe.

985
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:51,831
Keep it slow.

986
01:03:57,080 --> 01:04:00,709
A little thing I've been trying to get
Pittsburgh to fix.

987
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:05,873
- Johnny?
<i>- Yeah?</i>

988
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:10,875
- I wanna talk to you.
- You'll never get a better chance.

989
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,670
Pick up your pay cheque and beat it.
The rest of you men get back to work.

990
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,517
- What is this?
- I'll tell ya what it is, big shot.

991
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:26,398
Playin' us all for suckers
with a promise you never figured to keep.

992
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,357
Lettin' us break our backs
diggin' for more dough...

993
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:30,590
when you had the cards
stacked against us.

994
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,309
<i>Well, the cards are still stacked,</i>
<i>only this time we're dealin'.</i>

995
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,359
<i>Look around ya, big shot.</i>
<i>See what the boys think of ya.</i>

996
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,274
And when we finish with you this time,
you'll never gyp anybody again!

997
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,789
All right, break it up.

998
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,711
I said, break it up!

999
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,958
Rush him, fellas. We got him
where we want him now!

1000
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:57,157
<i>Hold it, Johnny! If you think</i>
<i>this guy's double-crossed you...</i>

1001
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:59,196
it's nothing to what
he's done to me.

1002
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,748
If there's anything left
when I'm finished, you can have him.

1003
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:03,990
This is one time you're
gonna do your own fighting!

1004
01:05:04,080 --> 01:05:06,230
- Trying to be a hero, huh?
- Get 'em up!

1005
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,675
Giving yourself a build-up
in front of the men.

1006
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,871
<i>Go get him, Cash!</i>

1007
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:14,428
So tough he used to break a pick
handle with his bare hands.

1008
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,717
And I can still break 'em.
And necks too.

1009
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,876
You once stayed three minutes
for a hundred bucks.

1010
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,679
<i>I'll give you a thousand</i>
<i>if you can do it again.</i>

1011
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,993
- What are you backing away for?
<i>- Go get him, Cash!</i>

1012
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:39,708
Shall I get you a pillow?

1013
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,035
Fight him like a miner, Cash!
Anything goes!

1014
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:54,797
- Where's Mr. Evans? Thanks.
- He went down to Number 7.

1015
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,671
<i>What happened?</i>

1016
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,471
Josie.

1017
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,871
All right, back it up!
Back up here!

1018
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:53,837
- Give 'em room.
- Give 'em room. Back up.

1019
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:56,229
Back it up.
Come on, people.

1020
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,398
Stand back there.
Come on, break it up now.

1021
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:09,236
Clear out.
Move on out.

1022
01:08:29,560 --> 01:08:31,516
Better get some coffee.

1023
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:33,909
No, Doc, I-

1024
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,560
May be some time yet.

1025
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,110
How is she?

1026
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:45,829
She's in a very critical condition.
They're operating now.

1027
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,269
I wish I could tell you
how sorry I am, Cash.

1028
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:58,271
You're a little late
waking up to that, aren't you?

1029
01:08:58,360 --> 01:09:01,989
- You gotta listen to me.
- All your life there's
only been one person, you.

1030
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,755
Now you think you can clean up everything
that's been happening for years.

1031
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:08,991
It isn't that easy. Even if you went back
to the beginning you couldn't change.

1032
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,197
What do you mean, couldn't?
There isn't a thing I can't do.

1033
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:15,397
That's what you used to tell Josie,
but she got wise.

1034
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,869
She once told me you were
no good, not for anybody.

1035
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,670
Funny how it's worked out, because
the one you're least good for is yourself.

1036
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,671
All the mistakes
you've made have piled up...

1037
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:27,399
and someday they're gonna come down
on you like a ton of slag.

1038
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:31,155
If I live to be a hundred,
I hope I never see you again.

1039
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,030
Come in.

1040
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,910
Hello, Shannon.
Going out?

1041
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,956
Yes, I'm having
dinner with Father.

1042
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:05,956
<i>Well, you're</i>
<i>a charming picture.</i>

1043
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,951
It appears that
for once in your life...

1044
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:10,076
you ran into something
you couldn't talk your way out of.

1045
01:10:10,160 --> 01:10:13,357
Brawling like
a common coal miner.

1046
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,035
I thought it'd be nice
if we had dinner together.

1047
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:19,156
Just the two of us.

1048
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,835
What a lovely idea, Charles.
It would be a novelty.

1049
01:10:24,680 --> 01:10:27,399
I'd like to make a new start
with you, Shannon.

1050
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:30,119
The things
I've said and done-

1051
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,031
I don't expect you
to forgive me, but-

1052
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,315
Well, that's very
generous of you.

1053
01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:36,595
And I'm glad
you feel that way...

1054
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:38,830
because I'll never
forgive you, Charles.

1055
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:44,359
Shannon. I'm not trying to defend myself
for what I've already done...

1056
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:46,749
but I'd like
to make things right.

1057
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:48,831
Maybe we could go
away for a year.

1058
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:51,718
- Take a trip around the world.
- Why have you changed so suddenly?

1059
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:53,791
Is it because
Josie Winters may die?

1060
01:10:53,880 --> 01:10:56,519
Is that why you've come running back,
to make sure of me?

1061
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,750
If that's cruel of me,
I'm sorry, Charles.

1062
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,831
All right, Shannon.
You can have your divorce.

1063
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,957
- I won't stop you.
- Markham, as time goes on...

1064
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:08,750
you'll realize that retribution has a way
of overtaking people, even as clever as you.

1065
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,796
Come, my dear.

1066
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:21,240
I'll never rest 'til
I break that fellow.

1067
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:26,189
I'll put him back where he was
the day he came into my office
if it's the last act of my life.

1068
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:35,073
This is Charles Markham calling.
Any news about Miss Winters yet?

1069
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:39,273
She is?

1070
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:43,239
If there's any change, will you have
Doc Powers call me, please? Thank you.

1071
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,040
From now on, we're gonna
be together, no matter what.

1072
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,111
No matter what.

1073
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:16,113
I beg your pardon.
Isn't your name Markham?

1074
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:18,156
Of the monkey business
Markhams?

1075
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,197
I really missed you, Josie.

1076
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:24,795
Dancing with you again,
it's- it's like old times.

1077
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:26,916
You picked the kind
of life you want...

1078
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,911
so go back to it
and to her...

1079
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,798
and at least let me keep
a little respect for you.

1080
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:43,389
- Hello?
- Hello, Pittsburgh.

1081
01:12:43,480 --> 01:12:45,675
Yeah, Doc Powers.

1082
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:48,593
Yes, I heard you'd called
several times.

1083
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:53,231
Well, I'm glad to be able to report
to you that Josie's out of danger.

1084
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:57,199
Yes, but it will be many, many months
before she's fully recovered.

1085
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:00,750
Thanks.
Thanks for calling, Doc.

1086
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:09,794
Thanks to guys like you
who forgot the human element...

1087
01:13:09,880 --> 01:13:11,757
labor's gonna be good and solid.

1088
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,753
You're the father of practically
a thousand new unions just
because you tried to be smart.

1089
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,956
How do you like that?
How do you like being...

1090
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,396
a guardian angel left-handed
just because you forgot to be human?

1091
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,675
I came to tell you things
are gonna be different.

1092
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:27,912
Different? I wouldn't believe a word you
said if you swore it on a stack of Bibles.

1093
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,468
I'm goin' whole hog for the miner.
I'm gonna make Pittsburgh...

1094
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,949
the greatest town to work
and live in in America!

1095
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,395
Nah. The boat sailed, Pittsburgh,
and you're not on it.

1096
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,948
Nobody'll ever like
or trust you again.

1097
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,716
We'll see about that.

1098
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:45,031
I'll make 'em like me.
I'll cram it down their throats.

1099
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,395
Even you'll be singing
my praises, Joe.

1100
01:13:47,480 --> 01:13:50,040
I don't have so good
a voice, Mr. Markham.

1101
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:52,395
So it's
Mr. Markham now, eh?

1102
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:59,549
There you are, something new.

1103
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:01,835
The model city
of Markham, Pennsylvania.

1104
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,275
Markham, huh? Named after?

1105
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:06,669
Joe Doakes. Look at it.

1106
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,716
For the coal and steelworkers
of Pittsburgh.

1107
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:12,679
Sunshine in every room. Movies.
A hospital. A recreation center.

1108
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:15,433
Practically rent-free.
The land is bought and paid for...

1109
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:18,080
and ready for occupancy
in ten months, right, Thornton?

1110
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,469
- Yes, Mr. Markham.
- How do you like it, boys?

1111
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:24,030
Where do you come in, Mr. Markham?
What's your angle?

1112
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:26,953
<i>My</i> angle?
This is all for the people.

1113
01:14:27,040 --> 01:14:29,554
A Christmas present
from Pittsburgh to Pittsburgh...

1114
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:31,517
and no strings attached.

1115
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:33,477
All you big guys are just alike.

1116
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:38,236
The harder you are when you're young,
the more you think of heaven
when you pass 35.

1117
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:43,036
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,
I have another appointment.

1118
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,598
I'll have that lug fired.
Did you hear what he said?

1119
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,875
You don't fire
newspapermen, Mr. Markham.

1120
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,428
They always have
the last word.

1121
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,795
As long as you rook
everybody, they like it.

1122
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:00,354
Treat 'em nice,
and they start wisecrackin'.

1123
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:10,714
Beg your pardon.
What's this building going up here?

1124
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:13,598
That's the new hospital
Charles Markham is giving the city.

1125
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:17,070
Charles Markham, the big coal
and steel man? I hear he's a great guy.

1126
01:15:17,160 --> 01:15:19,720
That's what he says.
But believe me, he's so crooked...

1127
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,677
he could hide
behind a corkscrew.

1128
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,514
Oh. Well, I hear
he does a lotta good.

1129
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:28,717
Any guy that's double-crossed
all the people he has...

1130
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:30,870
can't be on the up-and-up.

1131
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:33,428
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

1132
01:15:35,400 --> 01:15:37,277
I may be needin' this.

1133
01:15:48,120 --> 01:15:50,714
- Dinner is served, Mr. Markham.
- All right.

1134
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:53,997
May I wish you many happy
returns of the day, sir?

1135
01:15:57,040 --> 01:15:59,918
You certainly may.
Thank you.

1136
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,076
- Mike.
- Yes, sir?

1137
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:06,630
Have I ever done anything
you didn't like?

1138
01:16:06,720 --> 01:16:10,110
Well, sir, I can, uh, I can only speak
of personal contact, sir.

1139
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,634
In that respect you've lived up
to my highest standards.

1140
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,349
Then you can honestly say,
man to man, that you actually like me?

1141
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:20,479
Well, sir, speaking free and easy, and
man to man, I honestly would say it, sir.

1142
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:23,597
You're a good, democratic guy, Mike.
I'm gonna ask a favor of you.

1143
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,511
By all means, sir. What is it?

1144
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:27,477
- Have dinner with me.
- But, Mr. Markham!

1145
01:16:27,560 --> 01:16:30,791
I'll be darned if I'm gonna
celebrate my birthday alone!

1146
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:49,750
<i>Cash told you once</i>
<i>that all the mistakes you had made...</i>

1147
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:53,913
<i>were going to pile up and someday</i>
<i>fall on you like a ton of slag.</i>

1148
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:56,560
<i>Prentiss also knew it</i>
<i>when he promised to break you.</i>

1149
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,837
<i>And the day finally came</i>
<i>when Prentiss kept his promise.</i>

1150
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,480
<i>And that wasn't the end</i>
<i>of your bad luck, Pittsburgh.</i>

1151
01:17:02,560 --> 01:17:07,156
<i>It seemed as though some special</i>
<i>kind of justice kept following</i>
<i>you through the next years...</i>

1152
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:10,516
<i>until at last you were</i>
<i>counting your assets with a minus sign...</i>

1153
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,830
<i>and your friends on one finger.</i>

1154
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:16,310
<i>In all those years, you'd never</i>
<i>seen Cash and Josie again.</i>

1155
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,516
<i>In a way, I suppose,</i>
<i>they were grateful to you...</i>

1156
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:22,195
<i>for indirectly you had brought</i>
<i>them closer together than either</i>
<i>of them had ever dreamed.</i>

1157
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:26,558
<i>And as the parade of years went by,</i>
<i>you thought often of their</i>
<i>happiness and your troubles.</i>

1158
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:30,474
<i>Suddenly, one day all your little troubles</i>
<i>became less than nothing.</i>

1159
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,915
<i>The day the laughter</i>
<i>went out of the world.</i>

1160
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:34,956
<i>And in the weeks</i>
<i>and months that followed...</i>

1161
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:39,113
<i>the shadow of destruction</i>
<i>spread its darkness across</i>
<i>the face of the earth...</i>

1162
01:17:39,200 --> 01:17:41,998
<i>until what some people called</i>
<i>"the impossible" happened.</i>

1163
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:10,239
I appreciate your coming down here
when I phoned you, Doc.

1164
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:13,869
I'm all mixed up.
You gotta help me.

1165
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,918
That sounds odd
coming from you, Pittsburgh.

1166
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,877
I remember as though
it were yesterday.

1167
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:21,952
I never heard a baby squawk so loud
and determined...

1168
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:23,951
as though he were shouting
for everybody to hear...

1169
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,156
"There's nothing
in the world I can't do!"

1170
01:18:26,240 --> 01:18:28,071
That was a long time ago.

1171
01:18:28,160 --> 01:18:30,674
And yet there was one thing
you never learned.

1172
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,637
- What was that?
- Humility.

1173
01:18:32,720 --> 01:18:37,748
<i>You destroyed a great company</i>
<i>just because you wanted to be</i>
<i>the whole show.</i>

1174
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:41,879
Well, I've learned a lot
of things, but what can I do?

1175
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,520
- I guess I can still fight, eh, Doc?
- I wonder.

1176
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,750
You haven't thrown
a decent punch in years.

1177
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:50,628
<i>Always promoting. Why don't you stop</i>
<i>trying to be a skyrocket?</i>

1178
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:52,915
<i>Come down to earth.</i>
<i>Find a spot.</i>

1179
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:56,470
In what spot do you think
I'd do the most good?

1180
01:18:56,560 --> 01:18:58,676
Well, there are some
problems, Pittsburgh...

1181
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,796
that every man has gotta
solve for himself.

1182
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:04,956
So long, Pitt.

1183
01:19:11,640 --> 01:19:13,790
- Where you goin', Barney?
- Oh.

1184
01:19:13,880 --> 01:19:16,553
I'm goin' over to a meeting
of the third district defense committee.

1185
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,756
Here. I'm a senior
air raid warden.

1186
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:20,910
Heh-heh. See you later, Pittsburgh.

1187
01:19:46,120 --> 01:19:48,554
Report at 8.00
in the morning. Name?

1188
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,915
Charles... Ellis.

1189
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,788
<i>Charles Ellis.</i>
<i>Experience?</i>

1190
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:56,836
Coal miner.

1191
01:19:56,920 --> 01:20:00,071
<i>You thought no one would know</i>
<i>anything about Charles Ellis...</i>

1192
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:02,549
<i>but Josie, Joe Malneck</i>
<i>and I did.</i>

1193
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,949
<i>And we knew it was</i>
<i>the start of something good.</i>

1194
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:07,554
<i>That like black coal</i>
<i>on the way up to sunlight...</i>

1195
01:20:07,640 --> 01:20:09,790
<i>you too were beginning</i>
<i>to work out of the darkness.</i>

1196
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,713
<i>No job was too hard</i>
<i>for you, Pittsburgh.</i>

1197
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,837
<i>You were down to earth,</i>
<i>finding in honest work...</i>

1198
01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:18,832
<i>the first real satisfaction</i>
<i>you'd known in years.</i>

1199
01:20:18,920 --> 01:20:21,559
<i>It felt good to work</i>
<i>and sweat again, didn't it?</i>

1200
01:20:21,640 --> 01:20:25,474
<i>To match muscle and might</i>
<i>against a job that had to be done.</i>

1201
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:28,870
<i>Yes, it's good for the soul</i>
<i>to work with the hands, Pittsburgh.</i>

1202
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:31,599
<i>It cleans a man</i>
<i>all the way through.</i>

1203
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,719
<i>Matching your strength against steel,</i>
<i>you took on the strength of steel itself.</i>

1204
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,751
<i>Self-pity was forgotten...</i>

1205
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:43,470
<i>and as the weapons of war were forged,</i>
<i>so were you as a human being and a man.</i>

1206
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:47,030
You have the figures in front of you.
The list calls for an all-out effort.

1207
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,031
I read the list very carefully, Mr. Evans.

1208
01:20:49,120 --> 01:20:50,951
You've committed us
to too great a quota.

1209
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:54,635
We're committed to a war, Burns.
From now on it's planes, guns and tanks.

1210
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,597
- I've said we could do it.
- Yes, but-

1211
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,355
All we've been getting out of you for the
past month has been ifs, ands, and buts.

1212
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,750
I'm sorry, Mr. Evans. I'm not
trying to be unduly pessimistic.

1213
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:06,877
I'll admit that I'm not a war expert.
I'm only your production manager.

1214
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,394
You mean you were
my production manager.

1215
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,233
Very well, sir,
if that's the way it is.

1216
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:15,557
I know it's going
to be tough, gentlemen...

1217
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,676
but the production race
is on and we're in it.

1218
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,796
Jones, can you get your men
to roll up their sleeves an extra notch?

1219
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,075
I don't think they'll
let us down, Mr. Evans.

1220
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:24,993
Let's face the facts, gentlemen.
We're all in this together.

1221
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:28,470
Every man and woman in our factory
should have the same goal as our soldiers.

1222
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:30,551
Now let's get back to the job.

1223
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,275
Well, he finally got
around to firing Burns.

1224
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,909
But how could he?
He can't carry the entire load.

1225
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:44,117
Don't you think you're taking on
about four jobs too many?

1226
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:46,794
I can handle it, dear.
And stop worrying about me.

1227
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:49,592
Who's gonna take
Burns' place, Cash?

1228
01:21:49,680 --> 01:21:51,910
Think any of the men
in that room are big enough?

1229
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,833
- Well, I-
- I know a man who's big enough.

1230
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,388
A man who's on your payroll
this very minute.

1231
01:21:57,480 --> 01:22:00,597
He started on the labor gang
and he saved you one day out of seven.

1232
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,990
<i>When he moved up to the assembly lines,</i>
<i>he cut one hour out of every ten.</i>

1233
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:08,278
<i>With an idea for spot welding, he gave</i>
<i>you an extra 500 man hours a month.</i>

1234
01:22:08,360 --> 01:22:11,352
Yesterday I heard him cutting
costs in supply and procurement.

1235
01:22:11,440 --> 01:22:13,749
- Why haven't I heard of him before?
- I don't know...

1236
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,195
but he's tougher than a dozen red-hot,
spittin' wild cats.

1237
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:18,714
- Who is this man?
- His name's Charles Ellis.

1238
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:20,438
Send me Charles Ellis.

1239
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:28,477
Josie, you better run along.
Apologize for me to the guests.

1240
01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:30,994
I won't budge from here
until you come with me.

1241
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:33,275
Mr. Charles Ellis, Mr. Evans.

1242
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:37,273
Send him in. You win, Josie.
I'll be right with you.

1243
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:41,431
Ellis, I've been hearing
nice things about you...

1244
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:43,670
and I've decided that
you're the right man for-

1245
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,637
- What are you doing here?
- Don't ask me. You sent for me.

1246
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:51,188
I sent for Charles Ellis.

1247
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:55,637
Oh. So you're the wonder boy
I've been hearing about.

1248
01:22:55,720 --> 01:22:57,551
<i>I thought we had</i>
<i>an understanding.</i>

1249
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,437
We still have
as far as I'm concerned.

1250
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:03,354
<i>- I didn't tell ya to ask for me.</i>
- Okay, so I asked for you.

1251
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,000
- Now I'm asking you to go.
- Fine.

1252
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:09,470
But after this, before you
call me off a job, be sure you want me...

1253
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,516
'cause I'm particular
how I waste my time.

1254
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:14,160
If I call you off a job again
it will be for one reason.

1255
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:16,231
- To repeat what I once told you.
- Just a minute, Cash.

1256
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,198
- This is none of your business.
- I don't care whether
it's my business or not.

1257
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:21,794
I have something to say
and I want you to listen.

1258
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:25,714
This is no time to think
about personal feelings
and personal grievances.

1259
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,189
There's a greater,
far more important emotion.

1260
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:32,910
The only emotion that should
guide every one of us today:
devotion to our country.

1261
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,831
<i>That's the only thing</i>
<i>you must think about.</i>

1262
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,195
<i>You've got to forget</i>
<i>about everything else.</i>

1263
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,431
If you can use Pitt, use him.
Pitt, get that chip off your shoulder!

1264
01:23:40,520 --> 01:23:42,351
- Oh, Josie, I-
- Let me finish!

1265
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,476
I started you two on the road
that led to this very room.

1266
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,677
You've said it so many times
that I finally believe it myself.

1267
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,354
This is an emergency.
You need each other.

1268
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:53,591
Your country needs you.
What are you going to do about it?

1269
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:03,388
I need a production manager, Pitt.

1270
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:05,596
Okay, you got one.

1271
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,877
Put an order through right away.

1272
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:12,475
There'll be a meeting of all
department heads in Mr. Evans'
office in exactly one hour.

1273
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:18,833
Hello?
Hello? Who?

1274
01:24:18,920 --> 01:24:21,753
Mr. Evans said you'd get
your equipment Thursday?

1275
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,879
You'll get everything Wednesday, Johnson.
My partner made a mistake.

1276
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:29,913
Partner!

1277
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:33,436
<i>Once again you both rolled up</i>
<i>your sleeves and went to work...</i>

1278
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:36,478
<i>only this time it was for something</i>
<i>bigger than yourselves.</i>

1279
01:24:36,560 --> 01:24:39,120
<i>You tore out or converted</i>
<i>the old tools.</i>

1280
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,270
<i>In some places</i>
<i>you put in new ones.</i>

1281
01:24:41,360 --> 01:24:44,079
<i>And where articles of luxury</i>
<i>once poured forth...</i>

1282
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,993
<i>now streamed the guardians</i>
<i>of our American life.</i>

1283
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:51,039
<i>It was happening not only in your plants,</i>
<i>but in thousands of others.</i>

1284
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:54,556
<i>It was machine guns now,</i>
<i>instead of typewriters.</i>

1285
01:24:54,640 --> 01:24:58,918
<i>The work and material that made</i>
<i>lipstick cases now made cartridge shells.</i>

1286
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,549
<i>Plastic bomb noses</i>
<i>instead of lamps.</i>

1287
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,710
<i>And automobiles? No.</i>

1288
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:09,032
<i>It was planes, tanks, trucks...</i>

1289
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:12,476
<i>artillery and guns</i>
<i>flowing from the assembly lines.</i>

1290
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,630
<i>American industry</i>
<i>on the firing line.</i>

1291
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:18,474
<i>Labor and capital planning,</i>
<i>working side by side.</i>

1292
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:22,348
<i>It takes a lot of muscle and sweat</i>
<i>to put over a job as big as this one...</i>

1293
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:25,113
<i>and that's where the women</i>
<i>of the nation came in.</i>

1294
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:28,237
<i>Josie Evans and thousands</i>
<i>of others like her...</i>

1295
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,788
<i>doing their part</i>
<i>wherever they could.</i>

1296
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:33,553
<i>And there were others who found</i>
<i>they could run a drill press...</i>

1297
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:38,270
<i>drive a 30-ton tank or run</i>
<i>a stamping machine as well as any man.</i>

1298
01:25:38,360 --> 01:25:41,875
<i>Yes, millions of Americans,</i>
<i>men and women on the production line...</i>

1299
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,793
<i>to feed the supply lines</i>
<i>to the courageous Americans...</i>

1300
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,553
<i>fighting on battle fronts</i>
<i>all over the earth.</i>

1301
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,631
<i>Fighting for a decent world.</i>

1302
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,915
<i>Fighting for the survival</i>
<i>of free nations.</i>

1303
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,430
There's a reason
in my telling this story, Pitt.

1304
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:58,592
I think it should be told to
every man and woman in America.

1305
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,592
You two made a decision
that everyone in the land has to make.

1306
01:26:01,680 --> 01:26:05,355
That the most important word
in any man's language is "partners."

1307
01:26:06,920 --> 01:26:09,753
What's this? A war production
plant or old home week?

1308
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:11,671
Where've you been, Josie?
You missed the ceremony.

1309
01:26:11,760 --> 01:26:14,558
Well, I was busy,
but I heard you over the loudspeaker.

1310
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:18,553
Now, look. This is the plan
of the recreation room for the workers.

1311
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:21,996
I've made arrangements for the
lunch-hour shows, and for that
we have to enlarge the stage.

1312
01:26:22,080 --> 01:26:24,913
We could do it easily by-
Oh, come on, I'll show it to you.

1313
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,992
Maybe you have some better ideas,
although I don't think so. Come on.

1314
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:30,310
Come on, Doc, let's have a look.

1315
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,590
Doctor?
Dr. Powers?

1316
01:26:39,080 --> 01:26:42,550
- Here it is, Doctor.
- Well, what do you know?
A brand-new tire.

1317
01:26:42,640 --> 01:26:45,916
Yes, made of synthetic rubber.
All from coal tar products.

1318
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:48,309
Put it back on the treadmill
for another thousand miles...

1319
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,119
- and we'll test it again.
- Yes, Doctor.

1320
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:53,316
Say, uh, Doc,
about those tires.

1321
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:56,233
Uh, my front ones are, uh-
How's chances?

1322
01:26:56,320 --> 01:26:58,880
- Pittsburgh.
- Will you listen to that chiseller?

1323
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,872
I love ya, Cash.
So help me, I love ya!
